1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:00,853
In a centrifuge or they spin it in a 
centrifuge and extract the medium chain 

2
00:00:04,741 --> 00:00:06,450
triglyceride oil.
Pete Holmes,

3
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:08,350
that's what we're talking about.
Mct oils.

4
00:00:08,351 --> 00:00:09,184
This is what's funny.
Everybody's been asking me why we've 

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,483
never done one another's podcasts 
because we have an absurd amount of 

6
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:15,990
things in common.
I'll give you an example.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,930
I was watching some starlet like in the 
writer's room the other day,

8
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,700
starlit I started.
I don't remember her.

9
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:23,010
Never have used that word.
I'm from the 30th.

10
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:27,090
I don't know that I was just flipping a 
nickel under a streetlamp before the kid

11
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:27,924
may have a toothpick in your mouth,
but we were watching some startling on 

12
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:34,040
letterman and he was just one of those 
great letterman clips,

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:34,883
so it was really just being a dick.
That stuff you don't really see anymore 

14
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,183
and I loved it,
but he was making fun of the star lit 

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,720
because she ate clay and all I was doing
was googling edible cla.

16
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,650
Like I'm that guy.
I'm a believer.

17
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,990
You know what I mean?
Like I'm one of those guys that fucks up

18
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:50,850
medical studies,
you know what I mean?

19
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,580
Like they give me the pussy and I'm 
like,

20
00:00:52,581 --> 00:00:54,480
that works.
That was amazing.

21
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,500
My vision was sharp for four hours.
You know,

22
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,750
what is eating clay do for you?
You know?

23
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,430
See,
that's the thing is if she had letterman

24
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:04,440
was giving her all this shit and she 
couldn't do it,

25
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:05,580
but I could defend it.
I was like,

26
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:09,480
if you ate poison and you went to a 
regular western medical doctor that give

27
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:12,330
you charcoal activated charcoal is the 
same idea.

28
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:17,280
These earthy type of things draw out 
heavy metals and poisons from your body.

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,760
That's not to say that I'm going to go 
and eat a clay,

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,070
but every morning in my smoothie there's
a shit ton of,

31
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:24,000
uh,
w we can swear,

32
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:24,270
right?

33
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:24,871
Yeah.
Shit.

34
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:25,704
Ton of Alaris wondered if we could 
switch a professional comedian and 

35
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,290
youtube too much television fellow.
God Damn the man,

36
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:38,340
the television man.
Well fuck balls go a shit ton.

37
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:39,174
I'm swearing about how much Cilantro I 
put in my smoothies because Elantra 

38
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,590
Parsley,
these do the same type of thing.

39
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,390
Doesn't garlic,
didn't know Rhonda Patrick?

40
00:01:45,391 --> 00:01:46,800
Talk about that.
But regardless,

41
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,550
having some sort of an effect of pulling
heavy metals or attaches itself to heavy

42
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:51,384
metals,
was it her might have been so many 

43
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,813
believers.
So you're putting activate or whatever 

44
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:56,870
it is.
Well,

45
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,650
all is is healthy fats.
Totally.

46
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,360
This is super simple.
Good for your brain.

47
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,553
It's a medium chain triglyceride oil,
so it's the healthiest aspects of 

48
00:02:04,711 --> 00:02:06,180
coconut oil.
It's good.

49
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,050
Just get some healthy fats in.
Yeah.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,040
Are you.
Do you do coconut oil as well?

51
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,023
Yeah,
I'm a big fan of coconut oil and those 

52
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,360
forks over knives guys.

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,060
Have you seen them lately knowing that 
they're off oil,

54
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:20,400
they look like they're about to blow 
away.

55
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:24,570
They're dying in front of our faces.
They're so hardcore now.

56
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:27,120
I liked that movie,
but those guys didn't see that one.

57
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:29,210
I don't think it's about the China 
study.

58
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,350
The China study has been debunked.
Did you know that thing?

59
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,343
Who tried to scientists getting the 
entire Breitbart news staff know the 

60
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,750
China Study Alternative facts?
Unfortunately they didn't.

61
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,090
They.
They used some studies.

62
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,073
They use confirmation bias.
These some studies that correlate all 

63
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,060
the time.
One hundred percent legit scientists.

64
00:02:57,661 --> 00:02:59,760
Even vegans,
scientists who have debunked it.

65
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:00,380
Oh really?
Yeah.

66
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,420
I've looked at it and said,
well,

67
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:03,850
here's the issue.
They didn't bring up this.

68
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,610
They didn't bring up.
That couldn't have been perfect.

69
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:07,444
It was just a bunch of Chinese,
Jamie and pull something up on it 

70
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:13,210
because there's.
There's been some pretty good scientific

71
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:14,290
analysis of it.

72
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,243
Analysis.
CCS does that word hypothesis's that 

73
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:18,970
sounds like a wrong word.
Analysis is.

74
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,520
It's like the plural of thesis theses,
which sounds too much like feces.

75
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,050
It's one of those things you never say 
no.

76
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,540
Can we go rest in peace?
China study.

77
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,320
Chris Kresser did.
I don't know who that is.

78
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,900
He's brilliant because.
Yeah,

79
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,490
you spent on my podcast for two and he 
was a macrobiotic.

80
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,990
I make fun of Chris Kessler and you 
know,

81
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,520
I'm just doing a general but he gets 
fucked with online,

82
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:44,110
but one of the reasons why he gets 
fucked with his,

83
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:44,944
because he was a hardcore Vegan and he 
was having some pretty significant 

84
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:50,380
health issues and then slowly but surely
switched over.

85
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,220
Oh,
that's interesting.

86
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:51,820
Yeah.
He.

87
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,653
Well,
it's one of those things like some 

88
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:57,700
people can eat that Vegan Diet and love 
great and be fine and healthy.

89
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,670
It makes me feel I'm a.

90
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,400
I'm a flagging.
What's that?

91
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,560
Fish occasionally eat fish.
Fish is great.

92
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,620
I occasionally get drunk and eat 
roscoe's chicken and waffles.

93
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,640
The thing is I don't want to be militant
or stringent about anything.

94
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:10,474
It's just like kind of another thing 
that we have in common is consciousness 

95
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:16,780
and all that sort of stuff and I don't 
like being rigid about meditating.

96
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:18,760
I don't like being rigid about any sort 
of practice,

97
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:19,594
including veganism.
So like I tweeted a or I instagrammed a 

98
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:26,080
photo of me at shake shack.
I made a meme that said two drinks,

99
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,680
not Vegan and I look so happy.
I'm like,

100
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:30,514
I look like this.
I look like a meal and the feet of like 

101
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,020
a double shack burger.
It was unbelievable.

102
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,890
Double murder.
I,

103
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,583
you know,
it's really funny because I mocked 

104
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:42,994
vegans all the time.
I had this whole bit about vegans in my 

105
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:45,064
act,
but you will catch me at a Vegan 

106
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:47,860
restaurant at least four days a week.

107
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,370
But you know what you're doing.
I don't know if Aaron Rodgers is a,

108
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,860
not a friend of mine,
but a pal of mine,

109
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,720
all those nfl guys,
you know this.

110
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:57,730
I'm not going to tell you anything you 
don't know about athletes.

111
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,803
They're all eating plant based and meat,
like they eat clean protein and they 

112
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,520
plan.
I just do the plants.

113
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:06,130
I don't like the murder and I don't like
the way it makes me feel.

114
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:06,964
Frankly.
I like putting things in my body that 

115
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:11,740
are readily absorbed and I said this on 
my podcast.

116
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:14,680
I wonder what you think about this.
I say you can eat a steak for protein.

117
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,170
I'm very curious what you're gonna say 
about that because I bet you're going to

118
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:19,330
school me.
I say you can't eat a steak for protein.

119
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,220
It's kind of like drinking coke for 
water.

120
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:22,054
It's in there,
but you have to do a lot of digesting 

121
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:24,904
and grinding and extracting to get it as
opposed to something that you might 

122
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,520
blend and get into your cells more 
readily.

123
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,290
Well,
when you blend food for sure,

124
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,300
it gets in your cells more readily so 
you could blend the steak.

125
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,440
Yeah,
you can see that,

126
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,303
but I mean if you blend like vegetables,
it's much easier for your body to 

127
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:40,780
process like a smoothie.
Like God damn,

128
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:43,560
I drank these Kale smoothies and they go
through me like rocket.

129
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,740
And you mean it gives you the shits or.
Well,

130
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:48,580
not really.
The shits.

131
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,533
It's not.
The shits doesn't get me die unless you 

132
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:51,544
drink too much mct oil.
That's something I should bring up 

133
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:57,890
because it has come up.
If you take too much mct is it

134
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,620
ultra lubes you up inside?
And your body's like,

135
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:05,030
well that a huge cargo loads they've 
been holding onto just your childhood.

136
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,420
Like one of those,
uh,

137
00:06:06,421 --> 00:06:11,421
logging boats tips over very fast river.
Well that's what I see.

138
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:15,470
I liked that you brought that up is I 
eat Vegan to get high.

139
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,500
That's what I'm doing to get high.
Like if you eat three live,

140
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:19,490
like blue,
green algae,

141
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,920
that's going to ask you about that.
That's really,

142
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,023
really important.
If you do have vegan food and that's 

143
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,340
something that Chris Kresser brings up,
12.

144
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,060
Super important,
you know,

145
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,913
it's just,
it's very difficult to get with strict 

146
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:35,420
superintendent for,
to be in the dirt on the dirt.

147
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:36,254
It used to.
We'd get it that way and now I take it 

148
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:40,820
gets you high.
You can you take that?

149
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:41,863
There's this product.
I should have brought you something 

150
00:06:42,561 --> 00:06:43,270
called the High Huh?

151
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,030
Like,
like,

152
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,920
just feel good.
Just like clean,

153
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:48,230
like just like a river.
Like you're moving.

154
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,350
Do you think that has to do with like 
your placebo effect idea to that?

155
00:06:51,351 --> 00:06:53,640
Like I'm doing good.
I'm eating healthy.

156
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,493
Okay.
That I could not shake shack burger but 

157
00:06:57,021 --> 00:07:00,200
I've done it the other way.
I was not a Vegan for 35,

158
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,800
36 years.
So I have the data both ways.

159
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,090
Well it sounds like you're doing it 
smart.

160
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,150
If you're using e three live and every 
once in awhile you'll be like,

161
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,970
Jesus Christ,
I need some fucking Sushi.

162
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:11,804
I eat Sushi,
mi or would you be willing to eat eggs 

163
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,810
from a chicken that you knew lived in?
Like a yard?

164
00:07:17,811 --> 00:07:20,420
Like something that's like healthy where
you know there's no suffering.

165
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,313
I can dig that and I just want to beefs 
I have with Peta is that they have this 

166
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:28,690
campaign against eggs with Peter Peter 
with not.

167
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,673
Well I do and I don't.
I like Peter has actually retweeted my 

168
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:34,940
stuff a bunch of times because I'm 
really,

169
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:35,774
really against dolphin captivity and 
really against Orca captivity and I say 

170
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:42,110
I think it's slavery that we tolerate in
2017.

171
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:42,944
I really do.
I don't think it's anything other than 

172
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:44,714
that.
I think those things are arguably as 

173
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:47,654
intelligent as people.
They just can't communicate the way we 

174
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:52,700
can and they don't have hands that 
committed pilate objects and create art.

175
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,500
We have a hand.
I have a bit about this.

176
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,360
Why do we.
It's not about dolphins,

177
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:57,530
but it's like,
why do we eat pigs,

178
00:07:57,531 --> 00:07:59,810
but we don't eat dogs and I'm like 
hooves.

179
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,090
The evil feet.
That's true.

180
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,723
Dog with hooves.
Now picture everyone applauding because 

181
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:10,410
I dropped kicked that monster onto a lit
grill demon.

182
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,870
A cloven hooves.
That doesn't need its own chewing cud.

183
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,773
Yeah.
Yeah.

184
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,893
What if you saw a pig with pause point 
and if you saw a dolphin with hands or 

185
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:23,990
checking the Khatak no fucking way.
Well,

186
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,853
chickens are dinosaurs.
Chickens are fucking ruthless little 

187
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,320
monster.
So say that.

188
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,180
Oh yeah.
I fed my chickens mice before.

189
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,610
I have 23 chickens.
You do not?

190
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,120
Yes,
I do.

191
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,260
I love it.
I get all my.

192
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,310
I ate five eggs this morning from my 
chickens.

193
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,080
Shit.
Yeah,

194
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,270
they're like pets though.
Like I go out in the yard.

195
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:40,610
They're like pets to give me food.
Any attachment to them.

196
00:08:40,611 --> 00:08:41,760
Do you like your chicken?
Yeah,

197
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,080
my chickens died and my favorite one got
killed by a coyote.

198
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,760
That was awful.
Coyote running ran over the phone.

199
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,910
I saw it jump over that chicken chicken.
It's mouth.

200
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,870
Joe Rogan is after God,
man.

201
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,960
Then I found that the coyote was a 
mother coyote that had babies nearby and

202
00:08:57,961 --> 00:08:58,680
I felt bad.

203
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,910
I was going to kill her.
Oh,

204
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,753
I was going to set it up.
I was going to leave some food behind 

205
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:06,150
and sniper from the roof though.
Well,

206
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:08,350
I just felt like she's just doing what 
she's going to do.

207
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,253
I'll tell you something funny,
I met with one of the women that like 

208
00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:15,540
founded cafe gratitude,
obviously Vegan restaurant,

209
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,940
the Vegan restaurant that's deeply under
fire.

210
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:19,250
You know the whole story behind them,
right?

211
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,460
I don't.
Oh my God.

212
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,230
What's that?
They.

213
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,120
They started eating meat again.
Who did cafe gratitude.

214
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:24,954
The people own it really on a ranch and 
they started eating meat again and they 

215
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:29,604
started talking about it and they 
received death threats and people were 

216
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,890
protesting and boycotting the 
restaurant.

217
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,993
Yeah.
And they were terrified that they were 

218
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:38,100
terrified.
See,

219
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:38,934
this is why you got to be a fleeting as 
long as you don't stand anywhere to 

220
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:43,194
pescatarian.

221
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,900
Segun.
Segun?

222
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,753
Yeah.
Because pescatarian means you eat dairy 

223
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,520
because I don't fuck with daring.
Pescatarian means dairy.

224
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,410
Yeah.
Pescatarian.

225
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,070
I thought pescatarian.
Just fish.

226
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,410
It's vegetarian.
Vegetarian.

227
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,470
That means that she's Vegan.
So fish,

228
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,570
seagate and seagate.
None of these are catchy.

229
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:03,300
You have to just say league and which 
means you can't touch me,

230
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:05,640
but she told me when I met with her as a
nutritionalist,

231
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,480
and again I,
I might be wrong.

232
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,980
Nutritional list is not a worldly isn't 
word nutritionist.

233
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:12,410
Yes.
Nutritionalist,

234
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,250
I don't think.
Let's make it up.

235
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:16,040
All kinds of words.
Last night.

236
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,370
I need some help.
Can you help me out?

237
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,920
Give me some over smoking dope.
Brandon goes from right here.

238
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,320
I actually,
I'm on for right now.

239
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,410
Jesus.
Four.

240
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:28,150
I love four before take the liquid or do
you do the adults?

241
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,450
Here you go fill out a box.
Gives you a box.

242
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,540
Will.
I'll take.

243
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,620
I'll take what it did.
Oh,

244
00:10:34,621 --> 00:10:37,380
thank you so much.
I'm awesome.

245
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,940
Cynthia,
the box was sent to you.

246
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,741
Oh really?
Yeah,

247
00:10:39,741 --> 00:10:40,710
it's awesome.
Please.

248
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,150
I swear it tastes good too.
I'm sorry.

249
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,740
So go ahead Kathy.
But gratitude,

250
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,170
she was like,
look,

251
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,150
if you're not gonna do it if you're a 
Vegan.

252
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:48,984
But she was like the perfect thing to do
as an e three in the morning and one 

253
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:52,530
egg.
She was like,

254
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:54,990
you should eat one egg every day and 
this was good for you.

255
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:59,850
Clearly there's stuff going on.
Amino acid wise and cholesterol.

256
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,330
Cholesterol is important.
People you.

257
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,510
Did you see the study that came out?
Um,

258
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,420
that was,
uh,

259
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,720
in the New York Times.
It was not a study rather.

260
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:12,880
But because I want to make fun of,
no,

261
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,413
it wasn't expos in the New York Times 
about how the sugar industry paid off 

262
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:22,971
scientists in 19 fifties to demonize 
saturated fats and take the blame off of

263
00:11:23,941 --> 00:11:28,140
sugar and for like a really absurdly low
amount of money,

264
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:30,520
like $50,000.
We were saying,

265
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,460
not even,
I'll kill you money.

266
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,610
Yeah,
exactly.

267
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,333
For $50,000,
these guys essentially changed the way 

268
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,690
with this bogus study changed the way 
people think about sugar.

269
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,070
Which sugar sugar should be goddamn 
terrifying.

270
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:45,904
I know it's horrible for you.
Did you watch a food choices is a good 

271
00:11:49,741 --> 00:11:50,940
one.
Then there's fat up.

272
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,710
There's that sugar film,
that sugar film.

273
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,880
There's a of really good dance where 
you're just like,

274
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,400
oh shit.
I had Gary Tobbs in two weeks ago.

275
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:59,560
He's the author of the case against 
sugar.

276
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,540
Kevin Tubbs.
No different guy.

277
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,440
He's a.
If I think of a joke,

278
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:06,274
I'm going to science journalist and he 
wrote a great book called the case 

279
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:11,430
against sugar,
but apparently he's controversial too.

280
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:14,500
It's a bunch of people are mad at him,
mad at everybody.

281
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,960
These are big lobbyists.
This is going after like cocaine.

282
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:21,700
It's not that it was.
Other scientists disagree with him.

283
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:25,440
Other nutritionalist nutritionists.
You make them nice to you.

284
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,850
I'm sorry you put words in my brain and 
smoked dope.

285
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,610
Of course I did.
Why wouldn't I?

286
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:34,610
It's Sunday or something.
I'm not sure what there was.

287
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,940
No,
actually yesterday or the day off.

288
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:37,880
I didn't.
Um,

289
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,620
but.
Well I should have got high.

290
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,420
Watch the super bowl.
Yeah.

291
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,540
I walked away from the superbowl before 
the end.

292
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:44,740
I'm like,
this thing's done.

293
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,190
Patriots won in the most record over 
time.

294
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,680
Whenever.
What do you mean?

295
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,020
Four to 28.
It was down.

296
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,480
They were down 28 to three in the third 
quarter.

297
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,710
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

298
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,693
Tom Brady,
they say he's the goat the greatest of 

299
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:00,530
all time.
Oh,

300
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,140
okay.
I didn't know that.

301
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:03,190
You don't know that?
I didn't know.

302
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,020
Not a sports fan.
I met Tom Brady.

303
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,450
Did you give a shit?
I'm friends with Aaron Rodgers.

304
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,313
You didn't feel weird and random.
My Dad has always texting me a painter 

305
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,540
towel,
trying to get insider info.

306
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,270
How's Aron feeling today?
I got five grand on.

307
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,413
I fucking give a shit that I had an HBO 
special or have a show coming out is 

308
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,600
just like,
how's your day?

309
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,330
Tell me what happened is the wants to 
wait a little cash.

310
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,990
So let's go back to cafe gratitude.
So this cafe gratitude people.

311
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,003
They decided somewhere along the line 
what was really weird because they 

312
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:38,380
connected it to Jesus.
It was,

313
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:39,250
um,
they,

314
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:44,251
they had this statement that they made 
their jesusy they don't do cheeses,

315
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,330
but they'll do Jesus while they're 
older.

316
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,770
You know,
I feel in Anita left for that.

317
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,660
You know,
they don't do cheeses,

318
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:51,940
but they'll do Jesus.
I'm not going to give you a laugh.

319
00:13:51,941 --> 00:13:53,120
I don't understand that.
It's A.

320
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,580
Oh,
he must've not heard.

321
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:57,490
That's a Tony Hinchcliffe style on human
beings.

322
00:13:57,491 --> 00:13:59,680
Don't like jokes that computers would 
get it.

323
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,560
Granted,
no,

324
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,880
I liked them.
I just.

325
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,540
That was,
I don't know.

326
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,870
It didn't get me.
I understand.

327
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,591
You're like,
man,

328
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:08,270
it is what it is.
I might have laughed.

329
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,353
I like that you're honest there.
Jesus was going to say is I think this 

330
00:14:14,951 --> 00:14:15,784
happens to a lot of people to get older.
They start thinking that it benefits 

331
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:23,290
them to have some sort of potential 
deity in the future.

332
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,680
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

333
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,533
I think they think of the future and 
they think of heaven and they think of 

334
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:30,070
Jesus and God and all these,
get the numbers on that.

335
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:30,903
Like the conversion of people that 
become like serious Catholics when 

336
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:33,904
they're 70 might not even be Catholic.
They might go to an alternative sort of 

337
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,730
church or you know,
like just some sort of a worship place.

338
00:14:40,731 --> 00:14:43,870
Cc the door and you'd like a friend on 
the other side.

339
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,770
Right.
Well,

340
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,703
I,
I think gratitude is incredibly 

341
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:50,500
important and I think like a 
appreciation is incredibly important and

342
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,853
one of the things that helps people feel
gratitude and appreciation is a sense 

343
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:58,250
that there's something out there bigger 
than you and you sort of submit to that.

344
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,870
And I think when people get older and 
their health starts slowly deteriorating

345
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:04,490
and it's inevitable,
you know,

346
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,373
I mean as much as I'm 49 and as much as 
I exercise and try to take care of 

347
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:13,070
myself,
I definitely feel like it's harder.

348
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,490
It's harder to maintain a certain level 
of fitness and health.

349
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,660
It isn't as you get older.
Yeah,

350
00:15:17,661 --> 00:15:21,080
and it can have an excuse.
I'm just soft to you.

351
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,280
Can you have an excuse?
You're Vegan.

352
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:23,830
Tough.
It's tougher.

353
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,561
Oh,
come on.

354
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:26,810
You've had some of those super fit.
Vegans.

355
00:15:26,811 --> 00:15:27,730
Rich Roll.
Yeah.

356
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,150
You had them on.
Yeah,

357
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:31,210
for sure.
That it fit his very fit.

358
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:35,150
Different kind of fitness,
just running for long periods of time.

359
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:39,050
It's not really no explosion.
No one's trying to kick your ass.

360
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:40,490
Yeah,
there's a lot millions,

361
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,123
but my point is that I think that folks 
as they get older and they feel their 

362
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,920
their health slipping and they feel 
there's a lot of people that they really

363
00:15:51,921 --> 00:15:55,400
upped their workload as they get older.
Like I talked to Bobcat goldthwait about

364
00:15:55,401 --> 00:15:57,530
that and Henry rollins is the same way.
He's like,

365
00:15:57,531 --> 00:15:58,364
he feels like death at the door and he 
feels like he's got to be more 

366
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:01,310
productive.

367
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,410
We've got to get things done before he 
goes.

368
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,810
That's funny.
It could go the other way for sure.

369
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:07,970
You could go more of a Buddhist 
threatened be like death is coming.

370
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:10,640
Why was I so lost in this game?
Yes.

371
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,530
The toasted.
Every time I drink a green juice,

372
00:16:12,531 --> 00:16:15,530
I've said this on my own podcast.
I like to toast it and go,

373
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:17,540
it won't save.
You know what I mean?

374
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,970
But it was something beautiful.
And a lot of people,

375
00:16:19,971 --> 00:16:20,804
when they're nearing death,
a Rom Dass has a great quote where he's 

376
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:24,224
like,
most people do the most profound 

377
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:25,844
spiritual work of their lives in the 
last five minutes they're on earth 

378
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:32,300
because they get it.
You're surrounded by everybody stuck and

379
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:36,000
lost in the drama of this is important.
And Joe Rogan,

380
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:36,863
he called me an asshole on twitter or 
whatever it is and where there were 

381
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,710
suffocating,
you know,

382
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,540
and then they're free.

383
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,620
People that just go,
like,

384
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,690
it was just a game.
It was a dance,

385
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,220
it was a play.
It's a dance.

386
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,830
It's an experience.
That doesn't mean we can't play it.

387
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,023
I think like creative people for some 
reason feel towards the end that maybe 

388
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:56,530
they haven't done their best work yet.
Um,

389
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,240
and it's funny that this book is just 
sitting here randomly,

390
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:02,210
but this book,
the war of art is a title.

391
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,530
Have you ever read it?
No.

392
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,790
Please take it.
I've got a bunch of.

393
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,550
I'm going to leave here to the runner up
on double dare.

394
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,480
Steven Pressfield's book.
Good.

395
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,950
Jamie,
take the.

396
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,070
That signed.
One of them is signed,

397
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,263
signed.
Leave it.

398
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,890
I got one for sign.
Okay.

399
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,170
Leave that one.
Yeah,

400
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,130
I'll get you one step of art.
Um,

401
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:22,310
I bought stacks of them and I give them 
to people and press go on the podcast.

402
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:23,144
That's where this one is signed,
but it's all about resistance and about 

403
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:27,854
how it's very difficult for people 
sometimes to just get things done 

404
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,190
because they put things off and they 
procrastinate and they.

405
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,033
There's this weird thing that artists do
wear a lot of times they half ass stuff 

406
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,260
and it's almost like the,
the,

407
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:43,650
the pressure of creating something,
of expressing yourself,

408
00:17:43,651 --> 00:17:46,670
of doing something that you really feel 
proud of really good.

409
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,280
It just,
it's overwhelming to a lot of people and

410
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,800
I think for creative folks as they get 
older,

411
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,850
sometimes they,
they feel like there's no time left.

412
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,140
Yeah,
it's time to get going.

413
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,120
Liz Gilbert,
in her book,

414
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,133
big magic talks about how it's almost 
like there's a collective unconscious 

415
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,523
getting the tank gentle and there's the 
ideas and we're almost like fishermen 

416
00:18:08,911 --> 00:18:11,280
for ideas and something that I find 
motivating.

417
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,353
Like I'm trying to write a book,
I'm trying to do all these things and 

418
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:14,424
I'm like,
I got to reel in that fish before 

419
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,070
someone else that's quieter.
More tuned into that.

420
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:22,020
Unconscious is gonna is gonna get to it 
first.

421
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:24,090
You know what I'm saying?
There's like an urgency.

422
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,013
That's interesting because in an idea 
and then like five years later someone 

423
00:18:27,391 --> 00:18:32,340
else has something very similar and I an
idea or a concept similar kind of missed

424
00:18:32,341 --> 00:18:33,570
out.
Honestly,

425
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,100
that's not something I dwell on that 
much,

426
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,840
but I do see it.

427
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,313
The other thing you made me think of is 
Tarantino before he wrote pulp fiction 

428
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:42,630
was like,
I can't die.

429
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,560
He's like,
I just.

430
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,393
I had a fearlessness where he's like,
he was on like a bumpy plane and he was 

431
00:18:46,681 --> 00:18:47,730
like,
I'm not going to die.

432
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:48,683
I haven't finished pulp fiction,
and then he joked when he finished both 

433
00:18:51,781 --> 00:18:52,740
fiction,
it was like shit.

434
00:18:52,741 --> 00:18:53,574
Now he became very,
very nervous that he had kind of like 

435
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,880
fulfilled his destiny.
Wow.

436
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,720
That's,
that's ego mania.

437
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,880
Gun.
Why don't you think there is something.

438
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,583
Do you ever get in manic states when 
you're writing or creating where you're 

439
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,710
just kind of like burning clean white 
energy?

440
00:19:13,711 --> 00:19:14,610
You're just like,
oh my God,

441
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,250
this is just kind of coming through me?
Yeah.

442
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,580
Well at the moment I start realizing it 
at the moment it goes away.

443
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,893
Isn't that a lesson?
You know what I was gonna say to you 

444
00:19:23,491 --> 00:19:24,360
that I bet you would like.

445
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:25,523
I remember being very little and just 
being so much more interested than my 

446
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:31,800
other little friends.
At what happens when you close your eyes

447
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,050
and when you're.
When you're laying down at night.

448
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,143
I feel like a lot of people aren't doing
a lot of people that I asked about it 

449
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:41,250
aren't doing the kind of work of like,
what are you seeing?

450
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,113
What does it look like?
Mckenna Terence Mckenna talks about our 

451
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:45,594
dreams are probably far more interesting
than we ever even realize you're 

452
00:19:48,331 --> 00:19:51,360
remembered and if you're closing your 
eyes as you're falling asleep and you're

453
00:19:51,361 --> 00:19:53,670
paying attention,
if you see something amazing.

454
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:56,970
Like I remember one time I was feeling 
like I was on the bottom of a rocket and

455
00:19:56,971 --> 00:19:57,804
I just saw the exhausted,
this amazing rocket taking me to outer 

456
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:01,074
space and it was perfect.
It was pristine and as soon as I tried 

457
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:06,030
to hold onto it,
it goes away just like that.

458
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:06,923
Yeah.
That happens to a lot of people when 

459
00:20:07,951 --> 00:20:09,720
they experienced lucid dreams.
Yeah.

460
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,670
Yeah.
When you experience lucid dreams,

461
00:20:11,671 --> 00:20:12,720
like you're,
you're awake,

462
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,610
awake in the dream and then you realize 
it,

463
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:15,444
but apparently it's amazing that I 
haven't done anything to try to 

464
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:18,834
cultivate this,
but apparently it can be cultivated and 

465
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:22,254
there's a lot of people out there who do
experience lucid dreams and can manage 

466
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:25,620
that dream.
Yoga,

467
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,100
I'm a big lucid dreamers.
Are you?

468
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,003
In fact,
it's one of the reasons I saw a video 

469
00:20:28,921 --> 00:20:29,754
where you talked about Alpha brand 
helping with lucid dream ticket late at 

470
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:33,683
night.
I always have these fucking trippy 

471
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,473
dreams.
Like last night I took Alpha brain 

472
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:39,410
before worked out.
Um,

473
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,730
so it was a few hours before I went to 
sleep,

474
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,953
but I still,
I still had some really bizarre dreams 

475
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,700
as it's making its way through my.
It's wasted time.

476
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,980
I think there is a parallel to be drawn.

477
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,730
We were talking about the drama of life.
When you have a lucid dream,

478
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,840
I think there's something very in the 
Ballpark of enlightenment going on.

479
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,030
It's almost like a play version of 
enlightenment.

480
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,570
Enlightenment.
Why enlightened?

481
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,140
Because I'll have a dream that I'm back 
in high school.

482
00:21:05,141 --> 00:21:08,150
The classic dream and there's the test 
and it's a,

483
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,070
it's a nightmare.
Scared,

484
00:21:09,071 --> 00:21:09,904
right?
I'm scared and it's always like some 

485
00:21:10,661 --> 00:21:14,200
history of math class and I'm going 
around this very realistic.

486
00:21:14,201 --> 00:21:15,180
I'm in my high school.
The,

487
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,033
the geography is correct.
The people are correct and it's so 

488
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:20,530
realistic that I'm not just panicking.
I'm actually,

489
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,483
the dream is long enough that I'm asking
people to borrow their notes so I can 

490
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:29,830
cram and then there's a lot of 
techniques you can do to cultivate lucid

491
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:30,664
dreaming.
One of them I do all the time as I look 

492
00:21:31,571 --> 00:21:32,290
at my hands.

493
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,080
Anytime in waking life,
if something surreal happens,

494
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,660
you look at your hands because if you 
look at your hands in a dream,

495
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:39,550
they always look wrong.
It's a,

496
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,403
it's a giveaway that you're dreaming.
So I'll do something probably look in 

497
00:21:43,421 --> 00:21:45,160
your dream.
They look inflated.

498
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:47,680
They look like those sports fingers.
You know what Mickey Mouse hands.

499
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,553
It's ridiculous.
For some reason your subconscious can 

500
00:21:50,261 --> 00:21:51,880
create a beautiful,
you know,

501
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:52,714
NASA rocket taking off,
but your hands it can't do really turns 

502
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,374
out.
You don't know the back of your hand 

503
00:21:56,681 --> 00:21:57,514
that.
Well.

504
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,913
And then this thing right here is 
actually kind of trippy because this is 

505
00:22:00,941 --> 00:22:03,160
what clocks look like in dreams because 
it's left brain,

506
00:22:03,161 --> 00:22:04,330
right?
We're talking about this,

507
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,620
uh,
who makes out again,

508
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,620
what does team one made it to the next 
youtube clock?

509
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,450
What is the name of the studio?
I just thought it was wrong clock.

510
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,261
No,
no.

511
00:22:14,261 --> 00:22:15,094
This guy is amazing.
He does it all by hands and he by his 

512
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,190
hands,
he does it all by hand.

513
00:22:21,191 --> 00:22:24,850
Everything including the walnut case,
tg tgt studio,

514
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,020
tgt studios.
You order them.

515
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,960
He does a car,
cuts the walnut,

516
00:22:28,961 --> 00:22:32,200
and he uses those things inside of them.
Come from Russia.

517
00:22:32,201 --> 00:22:33,880
They're very difficult to get.
What are they called?

518
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,103
Nick's.
Nick's youtube.

519
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:40,410
What is the next to you right there?
If you had the whole answer.

520
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,450
Um,
but,

521
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:45,040
but when you're in the tubes,
any clock will look like that.

522
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,053
Oh really?
Because it's the wrong side of your 

523
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:47,740
brain.
What do you mean?

524
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,840
Any clock will look like.
That guy looks amazing.

525
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:52,180
I might mix these up.
It'll look wrong.

526
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,490
It'll be like,
it'll be 17:00,

527
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:57,250
it'll be 17,
the symbol for infinity.

528
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,293
And then ideally.
So the clocks will be fucked up too 

529
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,440
because the left side of your brain,
I might get these left,

530
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:02,800
right?

531
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,633
Confused.
But the left side of your brain is what 

532
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:06,310
streaming.
And the right side of your brain is what

533
00:23:06,311 --> 00:23:07,144
controls language and writing are so.
So another clue is if you pick up a 

534
00:23:09,911 --> 00:23:12,070
newspaper and notes and it just looks 
like Jibberish,

535
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:15,370
that's a that you're dreaming.
So whichever technique it is,

536
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:17,530
I'm having that horrible,
very real,

537
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:19,630
very important.
High school nightmare.

538
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:23,590
And then you remember that you're 
dreaming and you're still there,

539
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,110
but you're liberated,
liberated,

540
00:23:26,111 --> 00:23:27,940
silly.
There's no test.

541
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,970
That's,
that's a little taste of enlightenment I

542
00:23:30,971 --> 00:23:32,560
think as you go,
oh my God,

543
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:35,410
I was lost.
I was in that dream so hard.

544
00:23:35,411 --> 00:23:37,030
And then you went,
there is no test.

545
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:39,490
And then you fly to Milan and you have 
sex with Kate Upton.

546
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,590
You know what I mean?
Like you realize upton,

547
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,590
she's beautiful model.
I don't remember her.

548
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,980
Oh,
she's the one

549
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,370
with the really big breasts.
Got kind of heavy.

550
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,380
You got to kind of heavy and people were
mad.

551
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,990
It's just took a strange left turn for 
Kate Upton.

552
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,180
Right?
She was also,

553
00:23:56,181 --> 00:23:57,650
um,
yeah,

554
00:23:57,651 --> 00:23:58,590
that's her.
Yeah.

555
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,433
You know what's funny,
like whenever I'm in my podcast form on 

556
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:02,954
my website,
whenever people would be bored with the 

557
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:04,814
subject,
they will start putting up pictures of 

558
00:24:05,691 --> 00:24:08,660
Kate Upton.
It became a meme or a theme.

559
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:11,920
She came to a show.
I did a show with jed and.

560
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:15,650
And you met Leslie Mann.
Nervous.

561
00:24:15,651 --> 00:24:17,270
Look right at her and go,
oh my God.

562
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,900
Yeah.
I just heard the door.

563
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,413
Yeah.
So birds are amazing that through no 

564
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,680
nothing.
She did just just random genetic luck.

565
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,593
She has become like,
I don't know what your voice sounds 

566
00:24:32,811 --> 00:24:34,040
like.
I don't know a damn thing about her,

567
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,910
but she's pretty much perfect.
Yeah,

568
00:24:35,911 --> 00:24:36,744
she's very pretty.

569
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:40,000
Some people think she's fat.
Why Do,

570
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,410
if she gained weight,
I probably would just like her more.

571
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,480
Really?
Because you feel like she's human.

572
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,190
Soft,
soft.

573
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:49,670
I like to like the world to be safe.
Speaking of Tarantino,

574
00:24:49,671 --> 00:24:51,380
there's a great line in pulp fiction 
where it goes.

575
00:24:51,381 --> 00:24:54,080
It's a shame that the things that are 
pleasing to the touch aren't pleasing to

576
00:24:54,081 --> 00:24:55,730
the eye.
Like you're a hard man.

577
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,950
I bet it's more fun to hug me.
No offense.

578
00:24:57,951 --> 00:24:58,970
Please don't.
Don't let.

579
00:24:58,971 --> 00:25:00,980
It just depends on what you're into.
Yeah,

580
00:25:00,981 --> 00:25:02,980
but you look way better than I do,
so that's.

581
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,990
Thank you for how you look.
You should feel like me.

582
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,810
It should be like I'm a tempurpedic 
mattress.

583
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,610
I don't like.
Those are not hard to sleep on a slab.

584
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,980
Harder bed.
I understand.

585
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:18,260
Yeah.
I sleep on a pretty dense bed.

586
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,250
That's so funny.
Yeah.

587
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,790
You're.
Your sleep number is.

588
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,713
Well,
when I sleep because I don't know what 

589
00:25:25,221 --> 00:25:25,761
it is,
man,

590
00:25:25,761 --> 00:25:27,590
but whenever I sleep on a really soft 
bed,

591
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,713
get like a crick in my neck or my back.
Felt like a sink in too much or 

592
00:25:30,861 --> 00:25:31,970
something.
I understand.

593
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,500
I'm,
I don't have a tempurpedic.

594
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:35,220
I am the tempurpedic.
Well,

595
00:25:35,221 --> 00:25:38,900
you can get tempurpedic beds that are 
more dense I think.

596
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,850
I think they did come and various 
density.

597
00:25:40,851 --> 00:25:42,720
They do.
There's a from one.

598
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,500
So anyway.
Anyway,

599
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:50,480
she's a tempurpedic bed like beanbag.
I call them thicker,

600
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,550
thicker milkshakes.
I like thicker,

601
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,160
thicker milkshakes too.
But women.

602
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,750
Oh,
I understand.

603
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,023
My milkshake brings all the boys.
Are you attracted to women that are as 

604
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:02,690
fit as you?
Um,

605
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:05,780
I like women to take care of their body 
because I think that they have more of a

606
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:07,730
body awareness.
I think they're sexier.

607
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:08,751
That's interesting.
Oh,

608
00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:10,820
so you draw an intellectual comparison.
You Go,

609
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:12,950
you have abs,
therefore you know the science.

610
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,323
They have abs.
I think people who move their body a 

611
00:26:16,161 --> 00:26:17,780
lot,
like people who do yoga,

612
00:26:17,781 --> 00:26:20,930
people do gymnastics or martial arts or 
something like that.

613
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:25,931
I think they're more aware of their body
because they're communicating with in an

614
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,870
intense way.
You really.

615
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:28,743
Yoga.
Yeah.

616
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:32,420
If you do yoga like all the time,
you're communicating with your body in a

617
00:26:32,421 --> 00:26:37,421
super intense way on a regular basis and
I think you'll just be less awkward,

618
00:26:37,821 --> 00:26:40,790
more confident or more sensual.
I.

619
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,290
I completely agree.
Yeah,

620
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,430
and it helps.
Yoga helps you breathe.

621
00:26:44,431 --> 00:26:46,500
I remember when I did a lot of yoga,
the guy was like,

622
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:47,334
you'll notice that yogis always brief.
They stay calmer because they know what 

623
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:52,490
it's like.
It's another staffer.

624
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,630
It's another death thing.
It's like meditation.

625
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,493
You're asked to supposed to hurt when 
you're meditating because you're trying 

626
00:26:57,691 --> 00:26:59,640
to extricate your consciousness from 
your body.

627
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,740
You're supposed to hurt.
Like when you're sitting down.

628
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:06,170
What I'm saying is pain as part of it,
of yoga or meditating and of Yoga.

629
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,510
Yoga,
you could say their pain.

630
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:10,403
There's pain and yoga and I'm over here.
That's the only reason why I disagree 

631
00:27:14,881 --> 00:27:15,714
with you.
My best meditation by far is in a 

632
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:20,160
sensory deprivation tank,
which not only another thing.

633
00:27:20,161 --> 00:27:22,800
We haven't gotten no pain.
It feels amazing.

634
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,750
Yeah,
I wouldn't call that.

635
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,230
Do you meditate?
Do you?

636
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,450
Yeah.
Well I breathe.

637
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,713
My meditation is all concentrating on 
the breath deep in through the nose and 

638
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:35,904
out through the mouth.
I take these really long breaths where 

639
00:27:38,221 --> 00:27:40,260
I'll breathe in for like almost a 
minute.

640
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,333
Then I breathe out for almost a minute.
So you're very difficult to do 

641
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,580
oxygenating your blood.
Well,

642
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:50,130
I don't know if it's that or if I'm.
I'm controlling myself.

643
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,550
I'm exercising my personal control 
because you want to just bring.

644
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,340
You don't want to do it.
Like when you take,

645
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:01,350
try to take a long breath.
Like I'm one minute breath in.

646
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:03,400
It takes a lot of effort.
Yeah,

647
00:28:03,401 --> 00:28:04,234
I'll for sure.
And to hold it and then breathe out 

648
00:28:06,421 --> 00:28:09,750
slowly.
Well that's kind of my point is monks in

649
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:12,780
the mountains or you in the tank or 
whatever it is.

650
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:13,643
People doing yoga.
There's something bad ass about it is 

651
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,490
because you're doing something that 
looks like.

652
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,470
When I was a kid,
I just thought monks were relaxing.

653
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,550
Oh,
they just.

654
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:24,030
They couldn't take the world.
There are too many TV channels they went

655
00:28:24,031 --> 00:28:26,370
up into.
Those dudes are tripping out and they're

656
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,204
denying the pain of their body.
Just exactly what you do when you push 

657
00:28:29,971 --> 00:28:31,390
through a workout.
I had a friend of mine,

658
00:28:31,391 --> 00:28:32,700
he became a monk.
Really?

659
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,870
Yeah.
It was a regular dude.

660
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,490
Dunkin.
No different guy.

661
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,833
I don't.
I haven't communicated with them in a 

662
00:28:37,561 --> 00:28:40,440
long time.
I'm sure he's not a,

663
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:41,443
I don't know.
I mean he might be just completely off 

664
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:44,580
the grid now because he dove in 
hardcore.

665
00:28:44,581 --> 00:28:45,414
I was probably like 17,
18 years old and he was a guy that he 

666
00:28:48,261 --> 00:28:50,050
used to train with and my taekwondo 
school,

667
00:28:50,051 --> 00:28:51,450
his name was Joe.
Joe Smith,

668
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,663
last name.
Don't make us trying to remember his 

669
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:57,960
last name.
Anyway,

670
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,020
he's a nice guy,
but an interesting guy,

671
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:01,854
you know?

672
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,443
He was just like cool black dude.
And he started meditating because he 

673
00:29:07,651 --> 00:29:09,870
would get real nervous before sparring.
Oh Wow.

674
00:29:09,871 --> 00:29:11,070
Inspiring me.
And I'm real nervous,

675
00:29:11,071 --> 00:29:11,904
so he started to figure out a way to 
maximize his physical ability and 

676
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,930
potential and he figured controlling his
mind would be the best way.

677
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,003
So he got involved in meditation and 
then he sought out lessons at this 

678
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:23,544
Buddhist temple and he started 
meditating there and he got super 

679
00:29:25,951 --> 00:29:30,951
serious and then he quit his fucking job
and moved out of his apartment and lived

680
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:35,460
in the temple and just cleaned up for 
his food and he became a vegetarian,

681
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,400
very strict vegetarian.
He would eat just vegetables and rice,

682
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:42,190
that's all lost a shit ton of weight and
essentially stopped training

683
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,023
altogether.
Stop fighting and competing and doing 

684
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:49,231
anything like that and just would 
meditate and giving up your life to gain

685
00:29:49,361 --> 00:29:50,860
it.
That's like a Jesus thing and you know,

686
00:29:50,861 --> 00:29:53,500
like a Zen Koan,
like the sound of one hand clapping,

687
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,140
like you meditate on that because 
there's no answer to that.

688
00:29:56,141 --> 00:29:58,780
And he had a really weird one.
It was a really weird one.

689
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,793
Something about a dog barking is how do 
you know your Buddha nature through the 

690
00:30:03,521 --> 00:30:06,340
sound of a cricket and and you're just 
supposed to be like,

691
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,060
ah,
I've,

692
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,893
well the crackhead is may and I'm the 
cricket and they're just like taken 

693
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:12,910
stare in the corner.
Let's see.

694
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:13,744
That's pain too.
There's all this like we know in our 

695
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:19,990
life that suffering leads to growth and 
it leads to like a cleansing.

696
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,450
Sure.
I had all these things and I think these

697
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,313
turned on guys figure out that they can 
manufacture a type of suffering instead 

698
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:29,890
of waiting for it from the world,
which is going to come.

699
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,813
Inevitably.
You can go and sit on a hard ass floor 

700
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,420
or you can restrict your diet or you can
breathe in for a fucking minute.

701
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:41,320
You're causing suffering because you 
know on the other side of it,

702
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,810
that's where blesses.
That's where wisdom is.

703
00:30:43,811 --> 00:30:44,644
All these good things.
It's also the understanding that a lot 

704
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,393
of your desperate need to breathe.
It's just your brain fucking with you 

705
00:30:52,271 --> 00:30:54,850
and you're gonna be fine.
If you take this denial of the body,

706
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,183
like when I've been free diving and 
there's a beautiful thing when you're 

707
00:30:58,331 --> 00:30:59,920
low and you're like,
shit,

708
00:30:59,921 --> 00:31:02,380
you panic,
and my friend who was teaching me,

709
00:31:02,381 --> 00:31:03,214
he was like,
he calls it second breath where if you 

710
00:31:04,751 --> 00:31:08,050
relax,
you realize it's your brain fucking with

711
00:31:08,051 --> 00:31:08,884
you.
It's your brain is like a woody allen 

712
00:31:09,731 --> 00:31:10,720
character and he's just like,
well,

713
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,450
we better get up right now.
You know what I mean?

714
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:14,563
I need you to go shut up woodrow and you
realize you had way more oxygen and you 

715
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,013
relaxed and that that's.
I feel like it gets this reputation as 

716
00:31:22,601 --> 00:31:26,620
being kind of like a soft or maybe even 
like a feminine kind of meditation.

717
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,860
Yoga not so much now,
but it certainly.

718
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:30,783
My father doesn't think it's cool.
It has definitely a feminine reputation 

719
00:31:36,191 --> 00:31:37,024
or weak reputation,
which is insane because it's one of the 

720
00:31:38,591 --> 00:31:40,870
most difficult things I do.
I lift weights,

721
00:31:40,871 --> 00:31:43,180
I do martial arts and do all these 
different things and I swear to God,

722
00:31:43,181 --> 00:31:46,030
Yoga is as difficult if not more 
difficult than all of them.

723
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,893
Yeah,
for sure.

724
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,943
And I'll say you'd probably wait,
I mean you look like you're way a good 

725
00:31:49,901 --> 00:31:50,510
amount.
Yeah,

726
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,040
around 200 pounds.
Somewhere on there.

727
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,993
I wouldn't want to throw you.
So if you're using 200 pounds and 

728
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,370
you're,
that's your resistance,

729
00:31:57,371 --> 00:31:58,630
it's going to be difficult.

730
00:31:58,690 --> 00:31:59,920
Throw me.
What do you mean?

731
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:00,850
I,
you know,

732
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:01,683
I think I would hurt my back if I were 
trying to try to heat the martial arts 

733
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:05,374
stuff is the ball pit or something.
I'm seeing like a friendly scenario 

734
00:32:07,721 --> 00:32:09,900
where you go please keep me like a 
dwarf.

735
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:13,990
Oh,
do you want to throw me how you got from

736
00:32:13,991 --> 00:32:14,824
Yoga?
Throwing people away enough that I 

737
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:20,860
wouldn't want to throw.
You look at someone and go,

738
00:32:20,861 --> 00:32:23,260
I like to troll you.
You feel like have a small fella.

739
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:25,750
This is what folks do is we look around 
and go,

740
00:32:25,751 --> 00:32:29,710
who in in an order from one to 10.
Who in this room would I tossed first?

741
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:32,830
Who could I throw the furthest?
I would throw Jamie first,

742
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,083
but for me like there's,
there's moments in yoga class where I 

743
00:32:37,151 --> 00:32:40,040
swear I'm tested as much as anything 
ever in my

744
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,010
life right now where you're holding a 
pose and it's,

745
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,230
you know,
you can keep holding it,

746
00:32:45,231 --> 00:32:47,890
but you know,
you want to stop and you're,

747
00:32:47,891 --> 00:32:52,520
you're whole body is shaking and you 
literally see the sweat pouring off your

748
00:32:52,521 --> 00:32:55,160
face and falling off your body.
Especially hot yoga.

749
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,710
Yeah.
Yoga hot yoga class.

750
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,090
Oh.
Literally mean if I do cool yoga,

751
00:33:02,091 --> 00:33:02,924
I'm still the guy with the.
I got to put out the special towels and 

752
00:33:04,701 --> 00:33:05,820
stuff.
Yeah,

753
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:06,703
it looks like a dog,
but I've seen people do yoga on like 

754
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,030
hardwood,
shiny floors and you know,

755
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:13,430
like in or start sweating.
They're slipping all over the place.

756
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,440
That just doesn't seem smart.
No,

757
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,600
that's dumb.
That's very,

758
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:17,870
very dumb.
Yeah.

759
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,140
It doesn't get,
it doesn't get the respect it deserves,

760
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,670
but I think that,
uh,

761
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,500
you know,
it's also,

762
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,720
there's so many douchebags involved in 
it.

763
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,980
That's part of the problem.

764
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:30,800
Let's go.
Guys ruined everything.

765
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:34,580
They do body sprays.
I'd like to wear a Bluetooth earpiece.

766
00:33:34,581 --> 00:33:35,414
It sometimes I gave up on them,
I gave up on them when I saw how gross 

767
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:41,054
it looks from people.
It's interesting because you could be 

768
00:33:42,711 --> 00:33:43,544
having a meeting on a phone rather a 
conversation as long as there's a cord 

769
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:49,070
that goes into your ear.
Yeah.

770
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,420
I would be like,
oh,

771
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,840
he's just having a conversation on the 
phone.

772
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,950
That's cool.
But if you're standing there talking and

773
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:56,840
you're moving your hands around,
you got an earpiece and I'm like,

774
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:57,951
Douche bag.
Yeah.

775
00:33:57,951 --> 00:33:58,784
Yeah.
And if you leave it on blinking during 

776
00:33:59,841 --> 00:34:01,070
dinner,
you are a Douche.

777
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,380
Do they still?
Uh,

778
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,070
I,
some of them,

779
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,180
these two blue blue,
right.

780
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:10,220
Which bluetooths the guy.
He's got the airpods your buds buds that

781
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:14,870
are wireless.
They checked out Gary Vee.

782
00:34:14,871 --> 00:34:15,800
He was here the other day.

783
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,400
Gary Vaynerchuk just keep a.
He loves him.

784
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,470
I wonder if when the cordless phone came
out,

785
00:34:21,471 --> 00:34:22,490
anybody who was like,
hey,

786
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,170
that's douchey.
Oh,

787
00:34:24,171 --> 00:34:25,420
for sure.
What do you need?

788
00:34:25,421 --> 00:34:27,530
You don't need a court bro.
You fucking cool.

789
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,290
Oh,
somebody has a bit of that.

790
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,990
I wish I could remember where it's like 
the first person that used none Barela.

791
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:32,871
They were like,
oh,

792
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:35,300
you're too good to go with.
So I got an umbrella.

793
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,640
Like the latest technology was an 
umbrella.

794
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,350
I'm sure.
I wish people,

795
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,380
people are always looking to be upset at
cars that don't make any noise.

796
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:43,670
Oh,
you're going to look at your car and you

797
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,920
focus.
You're going to hit a cat.

798
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,813
Oh,
what are you using the solar power 

799
00:34:47,481 --> 00:34:48,314
instead of dead dinosaurs.
The dinosaurs aren't good enough for 

800
00:34:49,971 --> 00:34:50,804
you.
Although fossil fuel wasn't really dead 

801
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:53,930
dinosaurs,
just FYI.

802
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:58,070
It isn't mostly plants really plant 
based Diet.

803
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,470
Well,
it's um,

804
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,190
things rotten,
you know,

805
00:35:01,191 --> 00:35:02,024
but there's a,
there was a book called black gold 

806
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:06,410
stranglehold that I read.
It was so confusing because I was like,

807
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,500
I want to say like at least 15 years 
ago.

808
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,813
But the books,
the premise of the book was that what 

809
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:18,650
we've been hoodwinked and that the idea 
that oil is a finite resource,

810
00:35:18,651 --> 00:35:19,484
it's not true,
but it's actually a natural process of 

811
00:35:21,441 --> 00:35:22,430
the earth itself.
Like,

812
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,273
it'll keep making it a repeating process
in that wells that have been dry have 

813
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,900
rebounded when left alone.
Really?

814
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,380
I don't know if it's true though.
That would never looked into it again.

815
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,280
Maybe I live.
We looked at,

816
00:35:34,281 --> 00:35:35,840
maybe we talked about it once during the
show,

817
00:35:35,841 --> 00:35:36,800
but we were probably high

818
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,340
scatterbrained.
I had a great experience in a float tank

819
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,380
the other day.
I've done it maybe four.

820
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,850
Have you ever been your.
You have one,

821
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,180
don't you?
Basement.

822
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,520
That's awesome.
That's pretty cool.

823
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:49,870
I went to a place called just float and 
the first one,

824
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,090
the one in Pasadena.
Yeah.

825
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,620
That's huge.
It's the biggest place in the world.

826
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,780
The Best Company for him.
The biggest.

827
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,240
They have more float tanks I think than 
anyone in the world.

828
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,103
Well,
it's amazing because they're doing the 

829
00:35:58,711 --> 00:35:59,491
first one that I was like,
oh,

830
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:00,324
this is like a spa.
Like I've been to the one in Venice at 

831
00:36:01,531 --> 00:36:03,490
some guy in flip flops,
like my boy crash.

832
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,930
No Way.
Yeah,

833
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,600
he's kind of built my tank.
He's the best.

834
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,830
Yeah.
Well the float lab.

835
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:10,500
I couldn't get over the fact that he was
gonna come get me.

836
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,030
Oh,
he's the best night to worry about.

837
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:15,900
Crashing in the tank was like,
how long have I been in here?

838
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,233
Whose name is a sound effect is going to
knock on the door and it's gonna scare 

839
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:24,360
the shit out of me.
It totally ruined it at just float.

840
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:27,360
Maybe crash does this now.
It plays music at Lowe's.

841
00:36:27,361 --> 00:36:29,280
You out of it.
A lot of guys like to do that.

842
00:36:29,281 --> 00:36:30,930
It's a good move and it's like a pizza 
oven.

843
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:35,550
It's like a door in the wall and you 
crawl in and I had a pretty.

844
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:36,384
I was trying to go like leave my body 
and he ever talk about astral 

845
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:40,980
projection.
Well no,

846
00:36:40,981 --> 00:36:41,814
but I know what you mean.
I was spending most of it being like it 

847
00:36:43,441 --> 00:36:44,274
would be so trippy if I just went and 
visited my girlfriend right now I 

848
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,300
remember.
I'm not saying I did it,

849
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,493
but I definitely didn't do it,
but I remember having this very clear 

850
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:55,434
thought where I was like,
I've always wanted to try a sensory 

851
00:36:57,661 --> 00:36:59,760
deprivation tank and I was in it.

852
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:03,150
So it was somewhere else completely 
unaware that I was in it and then I like

853
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:06,540
jolted back into let's just say my 
awareness.

854
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:09,990
I was lost in my mind so deep that I 
forgot where I was.

855
00:37:09,991 --> 00:37:12,150
I forgot who I was.
Very relaxing.

856
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,380
Yeah,
it's amazing.

857
00:37:13,381 --> 00:37:16,590
And it's also something that the New 
England patriots use on a regular basis.

858
00:37:16,591 --> 00:37:17,424
How about that?
I really believe the falcons want used 

859
00:37:19,711 --> 00:37:21,060
it too.
They put the goat in there.

860
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,810
They use it for all their players.
They use it for visualization.

861
00:37:24,811 --> 00:37:25,644
They usually for recovery,
it's really great source of magnesium 

862
00:37:27,901 --> 00:37:29,190
too.
Because the EPSOM salts,

863
00:37:29,191 --> 00:37:30,900
it absorbs through your skin.
Yeah.

864
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,760
Do they change the water?
Yes,

865
00:37:32,761 --> 00:37:33,630
they do.
They do.

866
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:37,920
And they also filter it out like the 
float lab as a really intense filtration

867
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:38,754
system which uses ozone.
They use these gigantic spa filters and 

868
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,253
ozone and like to the point where it 
killed everything that might be in that 

869
00:37:47,881 --> 00:37:48,714
water except step to you except come 
except coming for sure beats off in the 

870
00:37:51,751 --> 00:37:51,930
water.

871
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,460
So a friend that went in one and he was 
like,

872
00:37:53,461 --> 00:37:54,294
I had to pay.
I just let it go when you want to spend 

873
00:37:56,551 --> 00:37:59,100
an hour in your own piss and then as a 
whole,

874
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,930
what does that,
the gratuity.

875
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,720
That's an asshole.
That is a real asshole move.

876
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,040
That's the thing that people are fucking
terrified of those things.

877
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:12,990
Hot tubs and swimming pools,
but they're ruining the communal.

878
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:13,824
It's like when I was in high school,
we used to have this vat of Coleslaw 

879
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:20,040
that was free and I was such a hungry 
boy that I would love the Coleslaw.

880
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,290
Then you find out that jocks are 
spitting in it like that.

881
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:28,780
That's whole ruin everything.
They ruin yoga.

882
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:30,990
Yup.
Yeah.

883
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,430
Earpieces,
Bluetooth,

884
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,980
veganism.
See that's why I don't want to

885
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,320
be a two associated with it.
So,

886
00:38:38,321 --> 00:38:40,150
um,
pull up the article and that,

887
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:45,010
that restaurant in La,
what was it called again?

888
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,660
Cafe gratitude.
Gratitude at the article came out in May

889
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,111
of last year,
so six,

890
00:38:50,111 --> 00:38:53,950
seven months ago they found out it came 
from a blog post that they had posted in

891
00:38:53,951 --> 00:38:54,784
2015.
So it had gone unnoticed for almost a 

892
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:58,240
year.
Then they were getting a bunch of shit.

893
00:38:58,241 --> 00:38:59,074
Yeah.
They made a blog post about what was 

894
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:03,180
their ranching and farming and that they
started eating meat again.

895
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,680
They felt healthier,
the animals raising responsibly,

896
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:10,080
but you know,
to vegans the hardcore,

897
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,940
at least it's still murder.
You know,

898
00:39:11,941 --> 00:39:14,140
you're still killing these animals.
You know,

899
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,120
I'm a.
are you a Joseph Campbell Felon?

900
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:16,751
Yes.
Love.

901
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:19,760
I'm here to return to meet by cafe 
gratitude owners,

902
00:39:19,761 --> 00:39:21,970
spark Vegan uproar,
uproar,

903
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,950
you know,
really,

904
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,800
really scary shit because they were 
getting death threats,

905
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:27,663
which is really.

906
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,980
Yeah,
I mean,

907
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:31,930
just doesn't seem.
It doesn't seem right away,

908
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:36,550
but you get a lot of that man.
You get a lot of people like,

909
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,690
look what's going on.
Like,

910
00:39:37,691 --> 00:39:40,780
you know that UC Berkeley,
I'm uh,

911
00:39:40,781 --> 00:39:44,380
the Milo Yiannopoulos protest that was 
going on a few days ago.

912
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:48,220
I saw this guy,
there was a girl out there.

913
00:39:48,221 --> 00:39:51,670
It was a trump supporter and she was uh,
trying to,

914
00:39:51,671 --> 00:39:53,740
uh,
I don't know if they were filming her or

915
00:39:53,741 --> 00:39:54,521
what,
but you know,

916
00:39:54,521 --> 00:39:57,520
there's a lot of people out there that 
they show up to these things and they,

917
00:39:57,521 --> 00:39:58,600
like,
they want to argue,

918
00:39:58,601 --> 00:40:00,790
they want to make videos and argue with 
people.

919
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:06,120
Some guy hit her over the head with a 
wooden handle of a sign and she swung at

920
00:40:08,831 --> 00:40:09,664
the guy and another guy got in front of 
her amazed or in the face and there's a 

921
00:40:12,941 --> 00:40:15,070
video of this and you're like,
Whoa,

922
00:40:15,071 --> 00:40:15,904
you guys,
you guys are the kind people that don't 

923
00:40:19,361 --> 00:40:20,380
want this man.

924
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,880
Who you think is,
you know,

925
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:25,030
they keep calling him a Nazi.
It's hilarious because he's a gay Jew.

926
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:30,850
Milo Yiannopoulos was Jewish.
Her doing it.

927
00:40:30,851 --> 00:40:31,684
Okay.
So she's wearing a make America great 

928
00:40:33,071 --> 00:40:38,071
again hat and some guy comes across.
This is not the video that I saw.

929
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:41,800
I saw it from a different angle,
but they take her,

930
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:46,120
she gets pepper sprayed.
Are they showing it?

931
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:48,940
They're not.
They might.

932
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,230
Oh,
okay.

933
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,170
That looks right there.
She just gets pepper sprayed,

934
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,000
like cc it towards the end.
It's crazy.

935
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,940
Somebody just pepper sprayed her just 
just because she's wearing that hat,

936
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:59,410
which is what it is.
Look,

937
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,543
that's a fucking man.
Just walks up to her and pepper sprays 

938
00:41:02,401 --> 00:41:04,090
or in the face.
It's crazy.

939
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,133
The idea that you think you could do 
that just because you don't agree with 

940
00:41:07,151 --> 00:41:07,990
that person.
Thoughts.

941
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:13,180
You can choose violence because you 
don't agree with that person's thoughts.

942
00:41:13,181 --> 00:41:15,190
Instead of having a civil debate,
she's not.

943
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:17,980
She's not as threatening.
She was not physical.

944
00:41:17,981 --> 00:41:21,610
She's not doing anything violent.
We're missing a mythic hero.

945
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,593
You know?
A lot of people want Bernie Sanders to 

946
00:41:23,411 --> 00:41:24,244
be that guy,
but we don't have a Martin Luther King 

947
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,330
that's telling us,
listen,

948
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,770
only love can drive out hate.
Only light can draw darkness.

949
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,010
So you ended up with a

950
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,843
lot of people that don't have a 
narrative or a story or a or something 

951
00:41:37,221 --> 00:41:38,054
in common,
and then you just have people kind of 

952
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:41,263
running it however they see fit and some
people are stupid and they're going to 

953
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:44,000
pepper spray paint.
Well,

954
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,800
there's also this.
Is this her getting,

955
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:49,510
this is another angle of it,
paid for it.

956
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,150
So she's got this hat on in a free 
country.

957
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:59,900
I mean it's fucking insane,
man.

958
00:41:59,901 --> 00:42:01,850
That someone could just walk right up to
her and pepper.

959
00:42:01,851 --> 00:42:02,684
Spray her in the face just because she's
wearing a hat that supports Donald 

960
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:05,950
Trump.
You know,

961
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:08,960
if you want to talk to someone,
you talk to them if you don't agree with

962
00:42:08,961 --> 00:42:10,310
them,
have a conversation with them.

963
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:14,020
But there's this narrative that's going 
around and it's punch Nazis,

964
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,740
right?
People keep saying that so.

965
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,180
Well,
who the fuck is a Nazi?

966
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,590
Who Do you determine as a Nazi?

967
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,360
You decide they're a Nazi and then you 
punch them,

968
00:42:20,361 --> 00:42:21,194
right?
Do you have evidence of this person's a 

969
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:23,270
Nazi?
Do you.

970
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:23,800
I mean,
do you,

971
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,940
do you see them?
Do they have a Nazi flag on them?

972
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:28,640
Are they saying Sieg Heil?
Do they have a copy of mine comp?

973
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,313
No,
you just decide wearing the halloween 

974
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,170
costume.
So here's how it goes.

975
00:42:33,171 --> 00:42:35,870
Here's the thought process is if you 
want it to fall like on a flow chart,

976
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:39,140
it's like decide someone's a Nazi,
then you can punch them,

977
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:40,760
punch Nazis,
find someone.

978
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:42,350
Are they a Nazi?
I say yes.

979
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,970
Punch them,
and so there's this.

980
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:46,160
There's a bunch of people like 
respectable,

981
00:42:46,161 --> 00:42:50,150
intelligent people that are just plain 
upset that trump is the president.

982
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:53,570
Just plain upset that in their eyes,
and I think rightly so.

983
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,200
There's a lot of assholes that support 
trump and there's a lot of assholes that

984
00:42:57,201 --> 00:42:59,150
are now gloating and they didn't know.

985
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,230
They're like,
grow up,

986
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,610
you lost.
We won.

987
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:02,563
There's all this going on,
and their response to it is now those 

988
00:43:04,881 --> 00:43:05,714
people are Nazis.
Go Punch Nazis and these really 

989
00:43:08,331 --> 00:43:10,760
impressionable people are out there.
Punch them.

990
00:43:10,761 --> 00:43:11,594
Do you see jake shields,
the former UFC fighters in mma fighter 

991
00:43:14,241 --> 00:43:15,074
is a good friend of mine.
He had to save some kid who was getting 

992
00:43:18,021 --> 00:43:21,800
beaten up by a whole group of people 
just because he was a trump supporter.

993
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,753
He didn't do anything.
He was just there at this thing and 

994
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:28,180
there's a few people that were,
you know,

995
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:29,203
trump supporters or Milo yiannopoulos 
supporters and the rest of them were 

996
00:43:31,821 --> 00:43:34,460
people that were mad that Milo was 
playing there.

997
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:35,643
It's,
it's so controversial and so fucked up 

998
00:43:38,481 --> 00:43:41,900
and so wrong because the left is now 
becoming the right.

999
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:46,320
Like you're becoming a fascist by saying
it's like a one stop fast.

1000
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,430
It's like a weird twists in the movie.
Yeah,

1001
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,580
I,
I love the.

1002
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:50,443
There's a kabir quote where he says,
do what you have to do with another 

1003
00:43:52,161 --> 00:43:53,960
person but never put them out of your 
heart.

1004
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:56,420
And I think that's a great way to 
remember.

1005
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,350
I was with rammed us with Duncan in 
Hawaii and he said,

1006
00:44:00,351 --> 00:44:03,530
I hate Donald Trump here,
not here.

1007
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,720
He pointed to his head and it's not as 
hard.

1008
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,613
And then the thing that I love,
and this has been a mantra for me for 

1009
00:44:09,651 --> 00:44:11,300
ever since I've heard it,
so it's been about a year,

1010
00:44:11,301 --> 00:44:12,134
but it's very applicable now,
I think is that hate is a lack of 

1011
00:44:14,691 --> 00:44:15,524
imagination.
So when you see somebody wearing a hat 

1012
00:44:18,231 --> 00:44:19,064
and then you make all these assumptions,
but you're not taking the time to 

1013
00:44:21,771 --> 00:44:22,604
consider.
Maybe this person was raised different 

1014
00:44:24,381 --> 00:44:26,120
from me.
Maybe this person is scared of this,

1015
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:28,160
this or this.
Maybe they had medical issues.

1016
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,173
You know what I'm saying?
Is this great David Foster Wallace 

1017
00:44:30,471 --> 00:44:32,100
thing?
Were you in that great

1018
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,800
graduation speech he gave called?
What is water?

1019
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,500
Have you heard that?
No,

1020
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,373
it's amazing.
But he talks about when you see an suv 

1021
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:43,860
on the highway and you just assume that 
there's some like piece of shit changing

1022
00:44:43,861 --> 00:44:45,510
lanes,
fucking burning gas,

1023
00:44:45,511 --> 00:44:49,520
taken up the world like a real kind of 
like a shorts and a grid out guy that's,

1024
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:52,040
that's a dick and taking more than he 
deserves it.

1025
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:54,000
He's like,
that's a lack of imagination.

1026
00:44:54,001 --> 00:44:54,834
If you consider that,
maybe that's a mother who was in a 

1027
00:44:57,061 --> 00:45:02,061
terrible car accident that was all but 
prescribed to drive a big vehicle so she

1028
00:45:02,101 --> 00:45:03,000
would feel safe.
Again.

1029
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,043
That's what I'm talking about when you 
see someone wearing a hat and you just 

1030
00:45:06,511 --> 00:45:07,740
go,
well that's a Nazi.

1031
00:45:07,741 --> 00:45:08,574
I'm going to punch it.
You're not taking the time to not just 

1032
00:45:10,261 --> 00:45:13,110
have empathy,
but actually compassion and realize that

1033
00:45:13,111 --> 00:45:14,280
we're all in this together.

1034
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:18,490
I remember after after trump won in the 
green room of a comedy show that we.

1035
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,353
I did a show the next day and somebody 
was having like a full blown panic and 

1036
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,290
rage and talking about how the 
terrorists,

1037
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:26,124
we're going to test him,
like the terrorists are going to test 

1038
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:28,620
them.
They're going to,

1039
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:29,453
they're going to do this and this and 
really panicking and it really kind of 

1040
00:45:31,951 --> 00:45:33,330
gave me a little bit of perspective on 
it.

1041
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:34,680
I was like,
if Hillary had won,

1042
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:36,263
we not us,
but other people who are just like us 

1043
00:45:38,671 --> 00:45:39,504
would be somewhere else in some other 
comedy club and some other greenroom 

1044
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:44,100
complaining about how the terrorists are
going to test hillary.

1045
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,660
She's weak.
She's a woman.

1046
00:45:45,661 --> 00:45:47,520
They're going to test her and it just 
made me realize,

1047
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,740
shit,
we're all in this together.

1048
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:52,470
That's what I mean.
Beyond empathy into compassion.

1049
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:55,500
When I see someone in a red hat,
I go,

1050
00:45:55,501 --> 00:45:58,110
there's my brother and my sister,
a different life,

1051
00:45:58,111 --> 00:45:59,880
a different path,
playing a different part,

1052
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:03,390
but we're,
we're all part of one body and pepper.

1053
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:06,360
Spraying that body.
You're just spraying yourself.

1054
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:10,290
I understand rage and and protests.
You know what I'm saying?

1055
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:12,450
I don't agree with trump.
Here's the thing,

1056
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,520
but violence.
We're hurting ourselves.

1057
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:15,543
I think you're right about a lack of 
creativity or a lack of imagination and 

1058
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:22,080
being able to look at that person and 
say,

1059
00:46:22,081 --> 00:46:22,914
well,
how did that person get to that point 

1060
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,220
and what went wrong in their life and 
why are they here?

1061
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:27,470
Where the,
you know,

1062
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:28,710
are,
uh,

1063
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,330
you know,
whatever it is,

1064
00:46:30,331 --> 00:46:35,331
whether a pepper spraying somebody or 
protesting against something or you,

1065
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,950
whenever you have a cause and you have 
two sides,

1066
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:39,870
people are going to jump on one side or 
the other.

1067
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,120
It's just natural.
People want to be in a tribe.

1068
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,230
They want to be on a team.
And when you set up the narrative and it

1069
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,290
really dangerous narrative that people 
on the other side of fools,

1070
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:51,930
people in there to sutter evil people in
the other side of the you,

1071
00:46:51,931 --> 00:46:52,764
you set up these two camps and these two
completely different sides and it 

1072
00:46:57,451 --> 00:46:58,284
becomes a black white issue,
but it becomes a red state blue state 

1073
00:47:00,691 --> 00:47:02,580
issue.
And this is what you're seeing here.

1074
00:47:02,581 --> 00:47:07,140
You're seeing fights.
These are tribal because it is us.

1075
00:47:07,141 --> 00:47:07,974
As soon as we come and ask,
they become with them what or had isn't 

1076
00:47:10,171 --> 00:47:13,170
even a trump hat.
It says may make bitcoin great again.

1077
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,270
It's a big one hat.
Oh Jesus Christ.

1078
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,660
What if I was suddenly so that guy 
pepper sprayed her and he thought it was

1079
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:21,360
a make America great again hat Jesus 
fucking Christ.

1080
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,390
Oh my God.
It's just assholes.

1081
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:26,700
You know?
And not only that,

1082
00:47:26,701 --> 00:47:29,680
most of them are wearing face masks and 
they're covered in.

1083
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:30,160
There's

1084
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:35,160
a mob mentality that is a very real.
It's whatever condition,

1085
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:37,870
whatever it causes it in the human 
psyche.

1086
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:38,943
But something happens where there's this
diffusion of responsibility when people 

1087
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:42,424
act in large groups that allows people 
to do really heinous things and it's 

1088
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:46,690
been studied,
you know,

1089
00:47:46,691 --> 00:47:47,524
there's been psychological studies drawn
on it or done on it and it's really 

1090
00:47:50,771 --> 00:47:53,950
confusing.
But you know that poll,

1091
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:54,813
everybody if you ever been in a riot 
type situation or in a group situation 

1092
00:47:58,241 --> 00:47:59,830
where there's a lot of people and 
something goes wrong.

1093
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,273
It's really weird.
There's a weird feeling that happens 

1094
00:48:03,821 --> 00:48:04,654
when a large group of people.
I was on the subway going downtown to 

1095
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:08,284
the women's March and it was getting so 
packed that people were starting to 

1096
00:48:11,381 --> 00:48:13,730
panic.
A kid threw up and stuff and I was going

1097
00:48:13,731 --> 00:48:17,920
to shit.
I forgot what it feels like to be with a

1098
00:48:17,921 --> 00:48:20,740
lot of us when we start getting scared.

1099
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:21,933
But that's the beginning of imagination.
That's the beginning of coming up with 

1100
00:48:25,481 --> 00:48:26,314
some sort of game plan for compassion 
when we can sit down and have a 

1101
00:48:29,921 --> 00:48:30,754
discussion.
I'm not saying don't make signs and 

1102
00:48:32,711 --> 00:48:34,930
don't raise your voice,
but I am definitely saying,

1103
00:48:34,931 --> 00:48:39,460
don't pepper spray somebody that's in 
this world with you.

1104
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,920
That's like trying to figure it out the 
best they can.

1105
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:42,813
You know?
I mean,

1106
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:45,400
this don't make sense.
Don't raise your voice.

1107
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:48,190
It's always a good thing to discuss 
things.

1108
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,053
Right?
But what's wrong with these discussions 

1109
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:51,873
with the Milo Yiannopoulos thing is 
they're trying to stop him from 

1110
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:54,934
speaking.
If you want to get your point across 

1111
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:59,380
schedule,
debate,

1112
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,333
he'd be more than happy to debate you 
and do it in a respectful manner where 

1113
00:49:03,431 --> 00:49:06,970
you can try to pick apart his points.
I've had milo on my podcast,

1114
00:49:06,971 --> 00:49:07,804
I've picked apart his points,
I've had him on and we've gone back and 

1115
00:49:10,361 --> 00:49:15,060
forth on the important shit like 
religion and circumcision and this.

1116
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:16,283
You can have a conversation with the guy
and what he's doing is he is getting a 

1117
00:49:21,371 --> 00:49:23,830
fuck ton of attention through the 
streisand effect.

1118
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:27,670
When you try to silence him by pulling 
him out of these,

1119
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,510
these things just for speaking and he's 
not doing anything wrong.

1120
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:32,523
He's just speaking.
The university has allowed him to be 

1121
00:49:35,261 --> 00:49:38,110
there and then people are going crazy to
do $100,000

1122
00:49:38,111 --> 00:49:40,090
worth of damage to the,
to the university,

1123
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:41,163
and then the fucking mayor of San 
Francisco congratulates people for 

1124
00:49:44,741 --> 00:49:45,574
speaking their mind.
He congratulates people for expressing 

1125
00:49:48,101 --> 00:49:49,460
themselves like,
no,

1126
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,420
that was a fucking riot man.
Like do you understand what happened?

1127
00:49:52,421 --> 00:49:53,254
100,000
dollars worth of damage and people 

1128
00:49:54,221 --> 00:49:55,054
getting beat up and a girl getting 
pepper sprayed for wearing a bitcoin 

1129
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:59,230
hat.
That's not good man.

1130
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:00,243
I know you want to be progressive and I 
know you want to be liberal and I know 

1131
00:50:02,171 --> 00:50:04,510
you want to be the mayor of the most 
progressive place,

1132
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:09,720
but this is all the wrong message.
The correct message is calm dialogue.

1133
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,750
People discussing things will keep calm 
and remain calm and carry on.

1134
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,420
So this guy,
Milo,

1135
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,350
when you're fucking screaming and 
yelling,

1136
00:50:17,351 --> 00:50:19,990
he wins.
When you stop him from doing that,

1137
00:50:19,991 --> 00:50:22,570
I think he sells more books.
You're also making a bigger point,

1138
00:50:22,571 --> 00:50:23,404
I think,
which is when we become us and we let 

1139
00:50:25,361 --> 00:50:28,160
them become them and we lose of the fact

1140
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:28,993
that we are all part of one body.
I mean when we shine it superorganism 

1141
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,600
yeah.
Talk about wanting to belong to a clan.

1142
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,930
We do.
We belong to a very special group.

1143
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:43,280
It's a trip that you're here,
that you are here at the same time.

1144
00:50:43,281 --> 00:50:45,710
I'm here and we're here talking.
That's beautiful.

1145
00:50:45,711 --> 00:50:47,660
That's what I like.
Hippie.

1146
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:53,610
I thought you've taken lsd one time.
Sticking together.

1147
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:57,220
I'm already on it.
I wish I were.

1148
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:59,060
I'd be.
I'd be going off even deeper,

1149
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,010
but I'm just saying when you take 
psychedelics,

1150
00:51:01,011 --> 00:51:05,210
you do get that glimpse into your like,
you know when you give.

1151
00:51:05,211 --> 00:51:07,280
So if I give you a gift,
if you give me this book,

1152
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:09,840
it's really just the right hand giving 
something to the lefthand.

1153
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:10,713
It's all one thing so it doesn't work to
fight against ourselves and it's not 

1154
00:51:15,081 --> 00:51:17,620
good to call somebody them and to be 
divided.

1155
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:18,371
Well,
it's also,

1156
00:51:18,371 --> 00:51:19,204
there's no communication going on when 
you're screaming and lighting things on 

1157
00:51:20,921 --> 00:51:23,830
fire and breaking windows at starbucks 
that's not communicating.

1158
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:24,853
You know,
you're expressing your anger that this 

1159
00:51:25,511 --> 00:51:28,570
guy who says that feminism is cancer,
talk to them.

1160
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:31,960
Try to figure out why he's saying that 
we have a debate with them.

1161
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:32,913
If you disagree with them,
find out what he's saying that's not 

1162
00:51:35,531 --> 00:51:40,000
valid and have a counterpoint to it and 
that's how people get to share ideas,

1163
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:43,000
express themselves,
and then the people watching get to look

1164
00:51:43,001 --> 00:51:44,260
at it and go,
well,

1165
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,153
he had a point,
but then his points better and then you 

1166
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,153
figure it out and that's the marketplace
of ideas and that's how human beings 

1167
00:51:49,871 --> 00:51:51,700
communicate.
And as soon as you stop that,

1168
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:52,713
as soon as you stop free speech,
you fuck the whole God damn thing up 

1169
00:51:55,961 --> 00:51:56,794
because now you have decided that you're
a fascist and you're saying that your 

1170
00:52:00,401 --> 00:52:02,140
ideas are more important than other 
people's.

1171
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:05,310
Don't you do a good devil's advocate 
person,

1172
00:52:05,311 --> 00:52:09,660
but don't you worry that some of the 
people that are making more base kind of

1173
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:14,690
dismissive generalizations like feminism
is bad and Muslims are bad,

1174
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:16,533
right?
Aren't necessarily listening to an 

1175
00:52:18,991 --> 00:52:19,824
intelligent dialogue,
so therefore isn't there sort of like a 

1176
00:52:22,111 --> 00:52:24,510
cause and effect of like,
this is some crazy shit.

1177
00:52:24,511 --> 00:52:26,280
We're going to do some crazy shit.
Some

1178
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:31,020
of them listen to Doris writing pepper 
spray and some of them aren't listening,

1179
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:31,883
but I think you always have to appeal to
the higher side of human consciousness 

1180
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:36,023
and you always have to express yourself 
in the most articulate way that you are 

1181
00:52:40,081 --> 00:52:40,914
capable of,
so you should try your best to get your 

1182
00:52:43,561 --> 00:52:45,390
thoughts across and it's not always 
easy.

1183
00:52:45,391 --> 00:52:48,630
It's oftentimes very difficult,
especially when emotions are involved,

1184
00:52:48,631 --> 00:52:50,760
especially when you think this causes 
very important,

1185
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:54,420
but I think it's critical because you're
doing something in a very public way,

1186
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,254
right?
Because this is something that people 

1187
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:58,380
are going to talk about for months and 
months.

1188
00:52:58,381 --> 00:53:00,990
There'll be talking about the UC 
Berkeley riots for a long time.

1189
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,393
It's very critical.
I think whenever you're dealing with 

1190
00:53:03,901 --> 00:53:04,734
something that is going to get massive 
exposure like that to do your very best 

1191
00:53:07,741 --> 00:53:12,480
to communicate your thoughts without all
this extra bullshit attached to them and

1192
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:13,343
anger and screaming and yelling,
don't get lost and don't get lost in it 

1193
00:53:16,501 --> 00:53:21,501
and and figure out a way to vocalize,
to articulate the the,

1194
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:26,750
the reason why you feel a certain way 
and what you have thought about it.

1195
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:27,990
Not,
not,

1196
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:30,390
not some knee jerk bullshit that's easy 
to dismiss.

1197
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:31,830
You know,
Muslims are bad,

1198
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:36,870
this is bad and that's bad and feminism 
is for full composed w not that way.

1199
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:41,520
Now to express why you think Milo's 
wrong.

1200
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:42,383
Express why you think he's right and 
that's the marketplace of ideas and you 

1201
00:53:45,811 --> 00:53:47,760
might disagree with that person that 
you're talking to,

1202
00:53:47,761 --> 00:53:48,594
but you've got to let them talk.
You got to let them talk and then you 

1203
00:53:50,531 --> 00:53:52,590
got to figure out a way to counter what 
they're saying.

1204
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:53,883
I,
again,

1205
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:54,743
not a good devil's advocate.
I think people worry when we let these 

1206
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:00,490
people talk and I went to it.
When you say these people though,

1207
00:54:00,491 --> 00:54:03,750
Milo is not something to worry about,
he's not a guy who advocates violence.

1208
00:54:03,751 --> 00:54:05,700
He's a really interesting guy to talk 
to.

1209
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:06,534
He's kind of a troll.
I mean what he's doing is fucking with 

1210
00:54:08,191 --> 00:54:09,024
people and it's really accurate and it's
really what he's doing is being very 

1211
00:54:12,331 --> 00:54:13,450
effective and he's.

1212
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:14,293
He's getting people to buy his books.
He's getting people to come to his 

1213
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,780
lectures is getting people.
When he got banned from twitter,

1214
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,630
that was probably the best thing that 
could've ever happened to him.

1215
00:54:21,631 --> 00:54:23,340
He did like a hundred interviews 
afterwards.

1216
00:54:23,341 --> 00:54:27,330
It was on CNN.
Even cnn they're doing like CNN supposed

1217
00:54:27,331 --> 00:54:28,380
to be news,
right?

1218
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:31,140
So He.
They have a photo of him.

1219
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:34,650
Ridiculous photos were in a fur coat 
with sunglasses on because it's so silly

1220
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:35,903
and it says Milo Yiannopoulos is trying 
to go to colleges to convince them that 

1221
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:40,944
hate speech is cool.
Like how the fuck is that an article on 

1222
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:45,870
CNN.
How is CNN saying that?

1223
00:54:45,871 --> 00:54:46,704
Because that's not what he's saying.
He's not saying that hate speech is 

1224
00:54:49,051 --> 00:54:50,460
cool.
Look at that right there.

1225
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:53,820
Miley Annapolis is trying to convince 
colleges that hate speech is cool.

1226
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:56,550
How the fuck is that?
The News?

1227
00:54:56,580 --> 00:55:00,600
It's not the news that is heavily 
editorialized that it.

1228
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,463
That's a ridiculous.
You're taking a stance on his opinion 

1229
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:10,080
that he would rabidly disagree with and 
it's not right and this is.

1230
00:55:10,081 --> 00:55:13,980
This is left versus right.
It's like CNN is the new Fox News.

1231
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:18,480
CNN is the sky's falling and the world 
is shared and we're fucked,

1232
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:23,100
and Fox News is now all of a sudden the 
grass is green and everything's rosy and

1233
00:55:23,101 --> 00:55:25,920
we're making America great again with 
bizarre.

1234
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:26,783
It's interesting because you're trying 
to zoom out and I think that's one of 

1235
00:55:28,621 --> 00:55:29,454
the things that's very integral to kind 
of getting through a time like this is 

1236
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:32,740
zooming out and going,
yeah,

1237
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:33,603
look,
looking at what's happening in a big 

1238
00:55:34,981 --> 00:55:35,814
way.
We're becoming what we don't want to 

1239
00:55:38,521 --> 00:55:39,960
become.
We're becoming militant.

1240
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:42,060
We're becoming violent,
we're becoming fearful,

1241
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:43,283
and I would.
I wish there were more opportunities to 

1242
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:46,350
have,
I guess these,

1243
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,780
these dialogues that could be done 
peaceably well.

1244
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:49,613
I think there's an issue also in that 
people do not feel like Donald Trump 

1245
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:53,724
represents what they think of as a 
leader in their mind and a lot of 

1246
00:55:56,941 --> 00:55:57,774
people's mind and in my mind,
Barack Obama was an amazing leader and 

1247
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,050
people will get mad and pissed at you,
especially conservatives.

1248
00:56:04,051 --> 00:56:05,140
We will.
What are you prone to?

1249
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,460
Listen,
that guy was smart.

1250
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:11,880
He was articulate.
He was calm and measured.

1251
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:16,080
Any always seemed like he wanted what 
was best for the country.

1252
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:18,150
Whether you agree or disagree with this 
policy.

1253
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:23,390
He and my mind was very statesmen like I
agree the way he would say when you're

1254
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,360
in,
when you're playing a part,

1255
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:26,253
the president.
I'm not saying the president is a 

1256
00:56:26,921 --> 00:56:27,754
puppet,
but I'm saying part of it is the 

1257
00:56:29,141 --> 00:56:32,380
mythological role.
I am the president and that's why people

1258
00:56:32,381 --> 00:56:36,490
talk about acting presidential because 
how much of it is that?

1259
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:37,683
How much of it is the way you handle 
yourself and the way that you treat 

1260
00:56:39,761 --> 00:56:44,761
other people and the way that you tweet 
or the way that the apprentice sucking?

1261
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,570
Yeah,
sad period.

1262
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:47,860
It's.
It's a strange.

1263
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:49,270
It just.
Even the vocabulary,

1264
00:56:49,271 --> 00:56:51,880
I see a lot of the trolls using some of 
the same.

1265
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:53,730
Yeah.
They're saying don't do that too.

1266
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:57,070
They say sad at the end of the surgery 
on Joe Rogan's podcast,

1267
00:56:57,130 --> 00:56:58,420
sewing up behind president.
You know,

1268
00:56:58,421 --> 00:56:59,050
funny.
Anyway,

1269
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:00,920
said Cook,
how did this.

1270
00:57:00,921 --> 00:57:04,150
What's it like to be a cook?
Well,

1271
00:57:04,151 --> 00:57:07,870
it happened because that's what one.
That is the response.

1272
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,840
We tried one way we didn't like it and 
now we're trying the other way.

1273
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:11,673
It is.
It's a classic example of what human 

1274
00:57:13,331 --> 00:57:14,164
beings do.
Yeah,

1275
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:15,303
we don't.
Well,

1276
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,840
that's zoomed out.
I like that.

1277
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:17,703
Well,
I don't think that the idea of a 

1278
00:57:19,001 --> 00:57:19,834
president is the smartest idea to run a 
group of 350 million people that are 

1279
00:57:24,401 --> 00:57:29,401
trying to integrate and communicate with
the other 7 billion people in the world.

1280
00:57:29,801 --> 00:57:32,410
Democracy isn't the best form of 
government.

1281
00:57:32,411 --> 00:57:34,840
It's just the safest.
It's good to quote,

1282
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:37,300
safest.
We have A.

1283
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:39,370
Patriarchy would be far more.
This is what they were like.

1284
00:57:39,371 --> 00:57:42,350
If you had a benevolent ruler,
like a really big good one,

1285
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,880
that would be more effective,
but it's too risky to do that.

1286
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:46,743
Way Too risky.
It's just contrary to human nature and 

1287
00:57:48,471 --> 00:57:52,420
absolute power corrupts absolutely.
That's a wavy gravy is easy.

1288
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:54,160
Great.
He was as kind as he is.

1289
00:57:54,161 --> 00:57:54,994
I think he's still alive.
This like weird hippie guy that kind of 

1290
00:57:56,441 --> 00:57:57,274
like the comedian of the time we did all
the psychedelic koolaid acid trip bus 

1291
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:03,163
thing.

1292
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,353
He had a funny joke where he was like,
he wanted to nominate nobody for 

1293
00:58:07,061 --> 00:58:07,894
president.
It was like we should vote for nobody 

1294
00:58:09,101 --> 00:58:09,934
because nobody can do it,
but it had all these funny slogans were 

1295
00:58:11,531 --> 00:58:14,740
it was like nobody can solve our 
economic prowess problems.

1296
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,890
Nobody cares about you.
Like all these funny thing.

1297
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:20,380
It was like,
and more people vote for nobody than any

1298
00:58:20,381 --> 00:58:22,810
other candidate combined.
We got to get nobody in the office.

1299
00:58:22,811 --> 00:58:24,490
Do you see what Neil degrasse Tyson 
posted?

1300
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,650
He said there should be an option for 
none of the above.

1301
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:30,160
Then if none of the above winds,
we start the process all over again.

1302
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:31,023
Why?
Why?

1303
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:32,820
I think a lot of people would have done 
that.

1304
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:37,330
I think that's a great idea because to 
make this artificial limitation like,

1305
00:58:37,331 --> 00:58:38,430
okay,
these are the people.

1306
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:39,493
It isn't able to grasp,
so I shouldn't be surprised how many 

1307
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:45,520
people would have lined up and gotten 
all around every way.

1308
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,620
They wouldn't have been live.
Tried to vote to have been like,

1309
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:51,420
I'm voting that we need to go.
We need to go back to one for,

1310
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:53,140
for president.
All the other things.

1311
00:58:53,141 --> 00:58:55,660
You get to vote for it and then for 
president vote none of the above.

1312
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:58,000
I bet it would have been like 70 percent
of the country.

1313
00:58:58,030 --> 00:58:59,010
I would have been.
It would have been.

1314
00:58:59,040 --> 00:58:59,873
Would it have been something crazy?
You would have done it just for the 

1315
00:59:01,241 --> 00:59:03,430
novelty of it been like I was the first 
one to vote.

1316
00:59:03,431 --> 00:59:05,110
None of the above.
Everybody wouldn't.

1317
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:06,660
You wouldn't been the first would know 
what?

1318
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:10,210
I think it would have been most of the 
country because I think that even if you

1319
00:59:10,211 --> 00:59:13,270
were opposed to trump,
there's very few people who thought that

1320
00:59:13,271 --> 00:59:16,390
Hillary was the ideal candidate for.
She was incredibly flawed.

1321
00:59:16,391 --> 00:59:19,180
She had deep,
deep ties to financial institutions.

1322
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:22,100
She wouldn't release the transcripts 
from and people get so mad

1323
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,290
when you talk about these things.
You're the reason why trump won,

1324
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:25,730
bro.
You're a big part of it,

1325
00:59:25,731 --> 00:59:26,564
man.
You kept harping all the problems that 

1326
00:59:27,291 --> 00:59:28,124
Hillary has said.
You're not supposed to ignore what's 

1327
00:59:30,321 --> 00:59:32,930
real and true and obvious about a 
person.

1328
00:59:32,931 --> 00:59:36,230
If the other person has flaws as well,
that's not how it works.

1329
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:37,123
That's just,
that's how you box yourself in and put 

1330
00:59:38,931 --> 00:59:39,764
blinders on.
That's not lifting up and looking at it 

1331
00:59:41,541 --> 00:59:46,541
objectively right above there.
The reality is it's an insane job to put

1332
00:59:46,731 --> 00:59:51,731
one person in power of all these people.
I think there should be a large group of

1333
00:59:51,861 --> 00:59:52,694
people.
It should probably be chosen by a large 

1334
00:59:54,111 --> 00:59:57,170
group of people.
I think that voting should be far easier

1335
00:59:57,171 --> 00:59:58,004
than it is.
I think registering to vote should be 

1336
00:59:59,151 --> 00:59:59,984
far easier than it is.
It should be something as simple as you 

1337
01:00:01,761 --> 01:00:04,700
have a social security number,
punching your social security number.

1338
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:06,740
Oh,
it shows here you're over 18.

1339
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:07,671
Yes,
you can vote.

1340
01:00:07,671 --> 01:00:09,710
It should be that simple.
Are you not a felon?

1341
01:00:09,711 --> 01:00:10,550
You're not a felon.
Okay,

1342
01:00:10,551 --> 01:00:13,450
great.
You can vote to vote online.

1343
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:15,543
Have a light buzz on.
Shouldn't there be like maybe some sort 

1344
01:00:18,831 --> 01:00:19,730
of a,
just a,

1345
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:24,970
just a very light test to determine what
your understanding is of these bills,

1346
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:31,100
what your understanding is about the 
impact of these things,

1347
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:33,830
what your understanding is about what 
this entails.

1348
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:34,693
I always think it's the immigrants that 
understand that stuff because they had 

1349
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:37,973
to go through a very rigorous process 
and then you asked me what the bill of 

1350
01:00:40,581 --> 01:00:42,260
rights is and I'm like,
oh,

1351
01:00:42,261 --> 01:00:43,094
Bob care.
When I was a kid I used to deliver 

1352
01:00:45,621 --> 01:00:47,980
newspapers.
When I say a kid,

1353
01:00:47,981 --> 01:00:52,981
I was driving,
you know when I was 16 and 18 and when I

1354
01:00:53,361 --> 01:00:55,760
was delivering newspapers,
there was this guy named a non,

1355
01:00:56,170 --> 01:01:01,170
a non and a n a n d,
this Indian gentleman who used to work,

1356
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:05,480
he was a pharmaceutical expert in his 
country,

1357
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:07,820
but when he came to America,
he,

1358
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:08,903
his degree didn't translate over here 
and so he's becoming an American 

1359
01:01:11,211 --> 01:01:13,250
citizen,
so he would always.

1360
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:14,990
He was.
He was a hilarious little dude.

1361
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:16,093
He used to swear all the time.
I weighed about 100 pounds and he'd be 

1362
01:01:18,231 --> 01:01:19,880
like,
I could easily throw them.

1363
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:22,430
Yeah,
you could throw him like a beach ball.

1364
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:24,020
He's like,
you don't know shit.

1365
01:01:24,021 --> 01:01:24,854
Nobody knows fucking shit.
Nobody knows shit in this fucking 

1366
01:01:26,781 --> 01:01:28,610
country.
What'd you do in this fucking country?

1367
01:01:28,611 --> 01:01:30,440
Who come here and then you'll go home 
and go to sleep.

1368
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:31,453
You don't fucking know shit about your 
fucking laws because he was trying to 

1369
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:34,814
read all this stuff because he had to 
become a citizen so you to take all 

1370
01:01:36,591 --> 01:01:40,490
these tasks and so he was a.
He would ask me questions,

1371
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:42,800
do you know you know what the 13th 
amendment is?

1372
01:01:42,801 --> 01:01:45,020
Do you know what the 14th amendment?
It was like,

1373
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:46,610
and I believe I don't know any of these 
things,

1374
01:01:46,611 --> 01:01:48,340
and he'd laugh and get the fuck out of 
here.

1375
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:51,050
Go do your route.
Which is a real friendly kids.

1376
01:01:51,051 --> 01:01:52,220
Children.
Exactly.

1377
01:01:52,221 --> 01:01:53,390
You know what I mean?
We don't know the value.

1378
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,233
We don't have to.
We don't have to and people tend to do 

1379
01:01:56,211 --> 01:01:57,044
what they have to do.
I think the way you become an immigrant 

1380
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:00,374
in this country,
we have to go through a comprehensive 

1381
01:02:01,581 --> 01:02:03,800
test and you have to understand the 
history of the United States.

1382
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:07,310
That test should probably be what you 
have to go through to vote.

1383
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:09,650
It's funny because I'm agreeing with 
you,

1384
01:02:09,651 --> 01:02:10,484
but we're.
What I'm agreeing with is we should 

1385
01:02:11,361 --> 01:02:12,194
simultaneously make it very,
very easy social security number and 

1386
01:02:14,601 --> 01:02:15,560
very,
very difficult.

1387
01:02:15,561 --> 01:02:18,920
Very easy to be registered to vote,
so it's not something go up.

1388
01:02:18,921 --> 01:02:20,010
You missed the deadline.
Fuck

1389
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:20,940
you.
Your vote doesn't count.

1390
01:02:20,941 --> 01:02:21,774
How quiet would the line be to vote?
Would all be studying like popped one 

1391
01:02:26,461 --> 01:02:29,480
random question and it was like 
Frederick Douglass,

1392
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:30,343
20 minutes you'd have to do it online 
and if you did it online you'd be able 

1393
01:02:33,391 --> 01:02:34,950
to cheat.
But even if you were ever to achieve,

1394
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,140
even if you were to what's more American
than that,

1395
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:40,240
but mean be looking it up on Google.
Right.

1396
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:44,400
But even then at least some of that data
is going to get into your fucking head.

1397
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:45,480
Yeah,
right.

1398
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:48,540
I mean that's gotta be better than the 
understanding that most people have.

1399
01:02:48,541 --> 01:02:49,374
Whether it's historical or whether it's 
just a comprehensive understanding of 

1400
01:02:51,991 --> 01:02:55,770
how our electoral process.
Because googling it doesn't stick.

1401
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,150
That was tom's.
It does.

1402
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:00,330
I don't remember shit like I have to 
listen to things about three,

1403
01:03:00,331 --> 01:03:01,164
four times before I finally,
but don't you think it's because they 

1404
01:03:03,841 --> 01:03:06,060
don't have like an emotional connection 
to you?

1405
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:07,950
Look,
if I read it's really important.

1406
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:09,450
Yeah.
Well I had a bit about.

1407
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:14,220
Well where I was like the time between 
not knowing and knowing is so brief.

1408
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:15,423
There's no feeling associated with 
knowing like you don't get adrenaline 

1409
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,910
and adrenaline is linked.
Linked to memory,

1410
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:23,490
like adrenaline is linked to memory.
Oh yeah.

1411
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:24,953
This is right up your alley.
If you're ever trying to memorize 

1412
01:03:26,041 --> 01:03:27,420
something.
College kids listening,

1413
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:28,363
get to studying for a test,
dip your arm and ice water every 30 

1414
01:03:30,871 --> 01:03:33,870
minutes or whatever.
It will become a traumatic experience.

1415
01:03:33,871 --> 01:03:34,704
It will help you memorize.
This is why we have a hard time for 

1416
01:03:36,211 --> 01:03:38,400
getting trauma,
so it's a very light trauma.

1417
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:39,263
Oh,
that's interesting.

1418
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:43,540
Or a trauma by just ice water,
which is not that traumatic at all.

1419
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:45,250
Big Old tank and dunk here.
They,

1420
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,660
they've done controlled studies and 
memorize.

1421
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:48,690
What a great idea.

1422
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:50,970
Well,
that seems to be like you could memorize

1423
01:03:50,971 --> 01:03:53,960
things really good in a cryo tank if you
did like crow genic.

1424
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,260
I've never done that.
Have you?

1425
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:58,840
I do it all the time,
dude.

1426
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:02,160
You fucking feel it.
That's 250 degrees below zero.

1427
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:04,320
Is that unbearable?
Yes.

1428
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,600
You do it for three minutes for some 
reason.

1429
01:04:06,601 --> 01:04:07,500
Okay.
Three minutes.

1430
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:08,363
For some reason I was like,
they figured it out a way to make you 

1431
01:04:09,961 --> 01:04:10,990
cold,
but you don't expect it.

1432
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:13,440
You know?
You experienced the fucker.

1433
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,520
What about infrared Saunas?
I did one this morning.

1434
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:17,080
Great.
I don't fuck around with that.

1435
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:18,653
Joe Rogan is good for you.
I spent messaging for a mixed blessing 

1436
01:04:23,581 --> 01:04:25,110
for memory,
stress in the brain,

1437
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:25,944
brain connection.
The limbic system includes the 

1438
01:04:28,801 --> 01:04:30,570
hypothalamus,
the hippocampus,

1439
01:04:30,571 --> 01:04:31,404
and these only one Jamie.
He just throws it up on the board and 

1440
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:33,943
the Amigdala and other important brain 
structures that govern emotional 

1441
01:04:36,061 --> 01:04:38,070
responses,
behavior and longterm memory.

1442
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:42,240
The release of adrenaline increases 
levels of activity of these areas of the

1443
01:04:42,241 --> 01:04:43,860
brain has been associated with improved 
memory.

1444
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:44,813
Isn't it funny like the words that he 
googled our bold this we were living in 

1445
01:04:49,831 --> 01:04:52,600
the future.
So amazing.

1446
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:55,830
But the bit I had was that Google's 
making A.

1447
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:56,873
I think it's one of the reasons I got to
do a talk show after Conan and I did 

1448
01:04:59,731 --> 01:05:00,564
these two Conan's sets and I think I 
picked good material and the first one 

1449
01:05:04,171 --> 01:05:05,004
was about how google is like a 
calculator that helps you cheat at 

1450
01:05:07,621 --> 01:05:10,200
everything that's funny.
So you don't know anything.

1451
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:11,983
And the example I give is there was a 
time like I've been in bed and I'm just 

1452
01:05:14,491 --> 01:05:17,090
like,
where's Tom Petty from mean?

1453
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:17,980
I just look it

1454
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:18,813
up.
Running.

1455
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,320
That was a real example,

1456
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:23,453
but back in the day,
if you didn't know where Tom Petty was 

1457
01:05:24,611 --> 01:05:25,444
strumming,
you just go around and ask people lie 

1458
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:29,940
jail bro.
He was born in Asia.

1459
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:30,973
Ah,

1460
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,100
and they'd be like,
holy his long hair.

1461
01:05:35,101 --> 01:05:36,680
He looks like California,
maybe California.

1462
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:37,723
Then one day you'd meet a girl and the 
heartbreakers tee shirt and she'd tell 

1463
01:05:39,801 --> 01:05:40,634
you Florida and endorphins and 
adrenaline and all this things would 

1464
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:44,443
light up in your brain and you remember 
that moment for the rest of your life 

1465
01:05:46,311 --> 01:05:47,144
and that's how you met your wife.
He's one of the few awesome things from 

1466
01:05:48,951 --> 01:05:50,810
Florida.
There's like Leonard Skinner,

1467
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:53,150
Tom Petty,
Billy Corbin,

1468
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,250
who was doing cocaine,
cowboys,

1469
01:05:55,370 --> 01:05:57,230
Disney world,
but in la,

1470
01:05:57,470 --> 01:05:59,570
what's better?
Disney world is supposed to be bigger,

1471
01:05:59,571 --> 01:06:00,404
right?
I like Epcot because I'm 37 years over 

1472
01:06:03,381 --> 01:06:06,230
there and they eat babies.
Remember that kid got snatched up.

1473
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:09,060
Fuck alligators.
There's no at Disney land.

1474
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,480
I know there's cougars though.
Chicks.

1475
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:12,523
Yeah.

1476
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:14,540
Lip Jobs.
I will.

1477
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:16,930
I buy into Disney.
I'm embarrassed.

1478
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:19,270
I want to be like,
fuck this shit.

1479
01:06:19,271 --> 01:06:20,104
This is.
You have children know when you have 

1480
01:06:21,491 --> 01:06:23,350
children.
Disneyland becomes a magical place.

1481
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:25,210
It already is,
but it really is.

1482
01:06:25,211 --> 01:06:26,044
If you have children,
some children in the big golf ball in 

1483
01:06:28,811 --> 01:06:29,790
the big golf ball.
What's up,

1484
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:30,863
bro?
Oh,

1485
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:33,550
hap.
But I was really young.

1486
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:37,150
I haven't been to Disney world.
I went to,

1487
01:06:37,151 --> 01:06:41,650
I did a corporate show at Disney world 
and it ended at like 10:00

1488
01:06:41,651 --> 01:06:44,760
and they'll keep one park open till 
midnight or something,

1489
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:45,933
maybe it's 11 and uh,
I went up but you couldn't buy tickets 

1490
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,280
until they stopped selling tickets at 
eight.

1491
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:52,383
So I went up to the gate and I'm talking
to the girl that I'm trying to get into 

1492
01:06:54,011 --> 01:06:54,960
epcot and you know,
they're,

1493
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,190
they're so trained to be good at 
customer service,

1494
01:06:57,191 --> 01:06:58,700
so they're just like,
I'm so sorry sir,

1495
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:00,520
you need a ticket and you can see the 
town.

1496
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:02,590
They're from like,
come on daisy.

1497
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:05,170
I know they'd raised you better in grand
rapids.

1498
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:07,900
She's like,
I'm so sorry.

1499
01:07:07,901 --> 01:07:09,520
And people are walking by going like,
Hey,

1500
01:07:09,521 --> 01:07:11,200
great show.
I'm like,

1501
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:15,220
and she was like,
I'm so sorry.

1502
01:07:15,221 --> 01:07:16,054
And I,
and then they opened the gate for a 

1503
01:07:17,291 --> 01:07:20,040
woman with a stroller and you stuck it 
in and I just went like,

1504
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,880
I just put my hands up and I was like,
daisy,

1505
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,280
I'm so sorry if,
if anyone asks,

1506
01:07:24,281 --> 01:07:26,260
I'm going to say that you tried to stop 
me,

1507
01:07:26,261 --> 01:07:29,170
but I'm going in what she do.
She was just like,

1508
01:07:29,171 --> 01:07:30,950
please don't please.
I was Kinda,

1509
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:32,950
I was kinda being a dick,
but she was just like,

1510
01:07:33,310 --> 01:07:36,220
please don't please don't.
And I walked and you go over this bridge

1511
01:07:36,221 --> 01:07:37,054
when you get in,
and as soon as I got over the bridge I 

1512
01:07:38,201 --> 01:07:39,220
felt like a refugee.

1513
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:40,780
Going back to Tom Petty,
Holy Shit.

1514
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:43,840
One of the best nights of my life,
my heart closed.

1515
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:44,823
We had some Saki.
I was with this young lady that was 

1516
01:07:46,631 --> 01:07:49,030
organizing the event.
We had soccer,

1517
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:50,710
soccer,
soccer.

1518
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:54,970
I play soccer.
I don't know if I've never heard anybody

1519
01:07:54,971 --> 01:07:56,200
say soccer,
but I think you're right.

1520
01:07:56,980 --> 01:08:01,360
But we drank it and everything in epcot 
is unlocked so the park is closed.

1521
01:08:01,361 --> 01:08:02,194
It's dark and we're waiting to get 
kicked out and we're opening every door 

1522
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:07,810
going into rides that have been shut 
down.

1523
01:08:07,811 --> 01:08:09,050
It was one of the more hands in the 
gears.

1524
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:12,310
What makes this thing work?
My finger was there,

1525
01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:14,000
could turn it off.
It was going that way.

1526
01:08:14,001 --> 01:08:15,960
It cut my hand off right here.

1527
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:20,300
Then I jumped fences and swam and every 
pool.

1528
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:20,991
I-Pass.
No,

1529
01:08:20,991 --> 01:08:21,824
you did.
And it was one of the best nights of my 

1530
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:23,690
life.
You jumped fences.

1531
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:25,850
Once you broke one law,
you're like,

1532
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:26,900
fuck it,
I'm a rebel.

1533
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:27,793
You get a little sack and you.
And then you get the feeling of 

1534
01:08:29,721 --> 01:08:32,570
entitlement that Disney provides.
They make you feel so important.

1535
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:35,210
It's one of my theories,
but I think rich people are assholes,

1536
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:37,670
is because have you ever stayed at like 
a four seasons or something?

1537
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:40,470
Then if you say at the four seasons and 
they love you and,

1538
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:41,241
and they're,
hello,

1539
01:08:41,241 --> 01:08:43,820
Mr Rogen,
we noticed your room isn't quite ready.

1540
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:45,200
Here's a Mai Tai.
You know what I mean?

1541
01:08:45,201 --> 01:08:48,020
They just kiss your ass so hard.
Then you go,

1542
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:48,943
I had this happen.
I stayed at the four seasons in Hawaii 

1543
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:54,350
and then the next week I was on the road
and Portland and I was staying at a best

1544
01:08:54,351 --> 01:08:55,184
western.

1545
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,400
I was just like,
this is why rich people are dicks.

1546
01:08:58,401 --> 01:08:59,560
Because I was like,
sorry,

1547
01:08:59,570 --> 01:09:01,400
your room's not ready.
And I was just like,

1548
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:02,593
could you call me?
When they looked at me like I was 

1549
01:09:03,921 --> 01:09:04,731
insane.
They were like,

1550
01:09:04,731 --> 01:09:05,564
no,
I'm not going to call you when it's 

1551
01:09:06,261 --> 01:09:09,950
ready to go get a fucking hundred grand 
bar and sit down.

1552
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,233
Nobody cares.
Sandbar John Molina is the best bit he 

1553
01:09:14,961 --> 01:09:17,240
did snl.
I tell the story like it's my own.

1554
01:09:17,241 --> 01:09:18,074
I don't even give a shit.
He was writing for Mick Jagger on snl 

1555
01:09:20,841 --> 01:09:21,674
and it really helped me understand why 
rich people and celebrities can be rude 

1556
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:27,500
because he's watching mcjagger go like 
diet coke.

1557
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:29,510
You know what I mean?
Not being an asshole,

1558
01:09:29,511 --> 01:09:30,890
but also not being like,
hey,

1559
01:09:30,891 --> 01:09:31,551
how's it going?
Joe?

1560
01:09:31,551 --> 01:09:33,920
Could I please get a.
can I get a diet coke please?

1561
01:09:33,921 --> 01:09:34,610
That'll be so great.

1562
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:35,443
I'm trying to write a new song.
He just goes diet coke and Malania was 

1563
01:09:38,301 --> 01:09:39,650
like,
I get it.

1564
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:43,850
You're not polite to Siri and when 
you're that famous,

1565
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,850
everyone is Siri checks.
Mix,

1566
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:49,520
shuffle the rolling.
So you know what I'm saying?

1567
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:51,223
Do you know what Siri is?
Just because this is the way you know 

1568
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:56,930
that you're talking to somebody.
You know they're not Siri,

1569
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:57,793
but they become Siri.
If you have five decades of everyone 

1570
01:10:00,981 --> 01:10:02,390
kissing,
you need to do acid.

1571
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:05,240
If that's where you're at,
you need to do mushrooms,

1572
01:10:05,241 --> 01:10:07,490
you need to do something,
you eat a cookie.

1573
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,300
I said many times my fantasy people have
like weird fantasies about getting trump

1574
01:10:11,301 --> 01:10:12,570
out of there.
My fantasy is,

1575
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:14,090
is turning them on.
Oh yeah.

1576
01:10:14,091 --> 01:10:17,780
Get them on some dmt and let them bring 
them to the center of my universe.

1577
01:10:17,781 --> 01:10:19,580
Texted me a fake photo.

1578
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:23,540
It's trump with a beard and it's on Fox 
News and it says lsd saved my life.

1579
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,250
I was like,
this is just a guy.

1580
01:10:25,251 --> 01:10:28,550
I just want want them to take mushrooms.
Spray.

1581
01:10:28,610 --> 01:10:30,050
Oh Shit.
Yeah.

1582
01:10:30,051 --> 01:10:31,790
To Stop.
I got it wrong.

1583
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,313
Actually recorded.
I have it on my phone if you want to 

1584
01:10:35,001 --> 01:10:37,130
play it.
I recorded this thing.

1585
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:38,023
I was listening to around us in the car.
Do you want me to play a short clip of 

1586
01:10:42,801 --> 01:10:45,380
rammed us from?
Do you want to hook it into.

1587
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:47,030
Well you could.
Can you do it?

1588
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:48,463
Okay.
It will be better that way because I 

1589
01:10:49,251 --> 01:10:51,230
recorded it just now in my car because I
was like,

1590
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:53,630
no.
I got one of them old iphones with as an

1591
01:10:53,631 --> 01:10:58,370
auxiliary jack.
I liked the Auxiliary Jack Cole annoyed.

1592
01:10:58,670 --> 01:11:00,620
Why would they do that to Lightening 
Jack?

1593
01:11:00,621 --> 01:11:03,530
Now you're assuming I can upgrade my 
car,

1594
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:04,813
my phone.
There's an adapter that allows you to 

1595
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:08,054
use an ox jack and the lightning and 
there's an adapter to make steve jobs 

1596
01:11:11,181 --> 01:11:13,500
rollover more efficiently in his grave

1597
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:15,533
because of the whole idea is no adapters
sticking out of your fucking phone like 

1598
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:21,390
a second Dick.
If you didn't have it,

1599
01:11:21,391 --> 01:11:24,480
people wouldn't buy it.
I like the option for an adapter.

1600
01:11:24,570 --> 01:11:26,490
In fact,
this phone started sucking ass.

1601
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,990
It's like crashing and shit and I was 
like,

1602
01:11:27,991 --> 01:11:29,760
if I bought a new one,
they are fucking.

1603
01:11:29,970 --> 01:11:31,510
Yeah,
they throw things in the mix.

1604
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:35,400
I believe that's a true conspiracy for 
sure.

1605
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:38,130
I think whenever you get a new iphone,
when the new brother,

1606
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:38,973
a new iphones released magically,
my old iphone starts hiccuping soon as 

1607
01:11:43,501 --> 01:11:45,930
that God damn I'm operating system gets 
updated.

1608
01:11:45,931 --> 01:11:47,520
It's true.
And they force you into it.

1609
01:11:47,521 --> 01:11:48,354
Yes.
You have to sync my phone to the 

1610
01:11:49,771 --> 01:11:51,600
computer and it was like,
you got to update your software.

1611
01:11:51,601 --> 01:11:53,880
I had been resisting you fucking bitch.
I was like,

1612
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:55,470
fuck your ass.
So anyway,

1613
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:58,350
I was listening around us and this was 
recorded in the eighties,

1614
01:11:58,351 --> 01:11:59,184
maybe early nineties,
and he talks about Donald trump and 

1615
01:12:00,601 --> 01:12:01,434
it's,
it's pretty fun.

1616
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:02,700
It's only a minute long lit

1617
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:05,970
hero figure within that mythic 
structure.

1618
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:08,490
It starts here that caught your 
attention to Donald Trump,

1619
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:09,473
for example.
Now you may snicker and not want him as 

1620
01:12:13,411 --> 01:12:15,450
a mythic hero figure,
but he is,

1621
01:12:16,090 --> 01:12:19,680
he is a hero figure in this culture.
And when I look at that,

1622
01:12:19,681 --> 01:12:21,590
it's a little like,
um,

1623
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:24,900
you know,
in those tribes where they take a maiden

1624
01:12:24,901 --> 01:12:25,734
and they honor for a year and then they 
boil her or throw her off a cliff or 

1625
01:12:28,681 --> 01:12:30,570
something like that.
I mean,

1626
01:12:30,571 --> 01:12:34,770
I'm not the Donald Trump myth,
not Donald Trump.

1627
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,140
He's just a porsche slump that's caught 
in the.

1628
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:42,470
He's been selected to play out the myth 
and he gets the feeling of,

1629
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:44,040
wow,
I'm Donald Trump.

1630
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:46,590
Enjoy baby.
You can have it.

1631
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:52,950
I mean,
Donald Trump,

1632
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:53,784
this is an obscenity because how much 
the person close their heart to keep so 

1633
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:02,250
single minded on that while all around 
them are the have nots.

1634
01:13:02,251 --> 01:13:03,084
And the people that are falling by the 
wayside just because of the way he is 

1635
01:13:06,421 --> 01:13:07,254
living.

1636
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:09,483
That's kind of it.
That's a weird argument just because of 

1637
01:13:13,691 --> 01:13:16,930
the way he is living because he is 
living in an opulent life.

1638
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,880
But if he wasn't living in an opulent 
life,

1639
01:13:19,330 --> 01:13:20,163
the resources required to make him live 
an opulent life would only help a 

1640
01:13:23,321 --> 01:13:26,800
certain amount of people.
There'd be a great number of people that

1641
01:13:26,801 --> 01:13:29,710
would still be left in absolute poverty.
This,

1642
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:31,690
I don't like that argument because I 
don't.

1643
01:13:31,691 --> 01:13:33,190
I don't think that that's what's going 
on.

1644
01:13:33,191 --> 01:13:37,000
I think there's a game going on.
I think he is completely invested in the

1645
01:13:37,001 --> 01:13:41,500
game and that game is acquiring money,
acquiring wealth and fame,

1646
01:13:41,501 --> 01:13:43,600
and he's really good at that.
And that's his game.

1647
01:13:43,630 --> 01:13:45,580
I mean,
he doesn't really produce anything else,

1648
01:13:45,581 --> 01:13:47,770
especially now that he's not the host of
the apprentice anymore.

1649
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:48,611
Right.
I mean,

1650
01:13:48,611 --> 01:13:52,780
he's the executive producer.
I mean without him doing that,

1651
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:54,700
arguably he's producing.

1652
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:59,280
And I use this very loosely art because 
that's what it is.

1653
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:00,173
You're watching the program.
What I like about what he's saying is 

1654
01:14:02,351 --> 01:14:03,184
he's just kind of stuck in the Donald 
Trump that somebody has to play that 

1655
01:14:06,551 --> 01:14:07,450
part,
the villain.

1656
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:08,433
Right.
But I don't think he's doing anything 

1657
01:14:09,641 --> 01:14:13,090
that's fucking anybody else.
Like I can't really.

1658
01:14:13,091 --> 01:14:16,990
I mean maybe he is.
Maybe is business wise maybe is how many

1659
01:14:16,991 --> 01:14:18,490
cars do you need?
You know what I mean?

1660
01:14:18,491 --> 01:14:19,324
Like when a holy man,
when you find out a holy man has 15 

1661
01:14:21,131 --> 01:14:24,190
Mercedes Benz,
the guy who owns a bikram yoga,

1662
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:25,210
that's what I'm saying.
Yeah.

1663
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:27,900
He owns like all these hate what 
happened with him.

1664
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:30,190
But we see these other guys playing 
these other roles going.

1665
01:14:30,191 --> 01:14:31,970
Like of course he has five helicopters.
He is,

1666
01:14:31,971 --> 01:14:33,820
he's a billionaire.
He do,

1667
01:14:33,821 --> 01:14:34,631
you know,
that guy's deal.

1668
01:14:34,631 --> 01:14:35,464
It's really funny.
He was being tried for tax evasion 

1669
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:39,220
apparently.

1670
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:40,180
And they,
uh,

1671
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:41,373
they found all these.
He had all these Ferrari's and bentleys 

1672
01:14:43,751 --> 01:14:44,584
and shit and he,
his claim was that he was starting a 

1673
01:14:47,711 --> 01:14:51,880
school for children and how to repair 
automobiles.

1674
01:14:51,881 --> 01:14:52,714
So that's why he got these cars.
That's a good alternative facts right 

1675
01:14:55,661 --> 01:14:56,260
there.
That's,

1676
01:14:56,260 --> 01:15:00,280
that's almost beautiful.
Such a unique case,

1677
01:15:00,281 --> 01:15:01,114
that beacon guy,
because they did an hbo real sports 

1678
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:05,210
about him.
I want to say it.

1679
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:08,290
Oh my God.
You have to see that fucking insane.

1680
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:10,020
He's insane.
I'm going to write that down.

1681
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:15,180
He was talking about these women that 
beat from Hud Noi,

1682
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:18,910
Noi.
He changed his name to hot yoga,

1683
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:22,390
Bikram Yoga,
last name,

1684
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:23,470
right.
Um,

1685
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:24,813
he,
um,

1686
01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:29,910
he was addressing these allegations of 
sexual assault and he said,

1687
01:15:30,011 --> 01:15:33,490
you know,
that women will give $1,000,000

1688
01:15:33,491 --> 01:15:35,860
for one drop of my sperm.
Oh yeah,

1689
01:15:35,861 --> 01:15:37,540
that's what he was saying.
They were like,

1690
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:37,840
no.

1691
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,010
The woman who was interviewing me was 
like,

1692
01:15:39,011 --> 01:15:40,250
what?
Yeah.

1693
01:15:40,690 --> 01:15:43,030
One drop of my sperm.
$1,000,000.

1694
01:15:44,270 --> 01:15:46,000
And that's like that.
Like oil.

1695
01:15:46,001 --> 01:15:48,970
We think maybe that does replenish.
He could really make a lot of money.

1696
01:15:48,971 --> 01:15:53,170
Imagine just a line of Petri dishes and 
him just grabbing his cock,

1697
01:15:53,171 --> 01:15:56,470
like a bent garden hose and just 
dripping out little drops.

1698
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,270
One million,
1 million,

1699
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,730
1 million pip,
pip.

1700
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:03,350
About a billion dollars off my stomach.
Really?

1701
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:04,203
How dare you.
This is the guy that's responsible for 

1702
01:16:07,931 --> 01:16:08,764
this.
It's really so it's so interesting 

1703
01:16:10,271 --> 01:16:13,660
because it's so.
It kind of embodies what's bizarre about

1704
01:16:13,661 --> 01:16:14,494
human beings because this guy's 
responsible for so many people's 

1705
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:21,730
personal growth and enlightenment by him
bringing yoga and hot yoga to the United

1706
01:16:21,730 --> 01:16:22,563
States and making it so popular of being
this force because perhaps because of 

1707
01:16:25,691 --> 01:16:26,524
his ego,
because of his desire to achieve fame 

1708
01:16:30,071 --> 01:16:32,410
and fortune and all these different 
things that he has gotten,

1709
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:36,460
he's also spread this thing that's been 
amazingly beneficial to people,

1710
01:16:36,461 --> 01:16:40,750
which has in turn fueled his self 
righteous indignation.

1711
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:42,790
It's actually kind of goes back to the 
rioting.

1712
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:43,893
Aride is a bad thing.
This guy being an asshole is a bad 

1713
01:16:45,790 --> 01:16:47,410
thing,
but it's a bad thing.

1714
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:52,500
Almost hoping to do a good thing or 
maybe a bad thing that also does.

1715
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:56,050
Have you ever met somebody that's a real
piece of shit,

1716
01:16:56,051 --> 01:16:56,884
but they also do a lot of charity work 
and the charity work sort of masks the 

1717
01:17:00,401 --> 01:17:01,234
fact they're a piece of shit.
Like that was one of the things about 

1718
01:17:03,090 --> 01:17:05,800
Sandusky.
Send Dusky was this.

1719
01:17:05,890 --> 01:17:06,723
One of the things about him is that he 
was molesting all boys that he was 

1720
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:13,250
helping,
so he ran this charity for boys and then

1721
01:17:13,251 --> 01:17:18,251
he was fucking horrible,
but it's something that people do.

1722
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:21,050
They run,
they'll do something where they're doing

1723
01:17:21,051 --> 01:17:21,884
something very charitable sorta to mask 
how shitty their our or to justify who 

1724
01:17:25,731 --> 01:17:30,020
they are and there is someone in this 
kind of fucked up scenario that did just

1725
01:17:30,021 --> 01:17:30,854
benefit.

1726
01:17:30,930 --> 01:17:31,763
You know what I'm saying?
There's someone who just benefited from 

1727
01:17:33,051 --> 01:17:36,080
that and no one evil.
Yeah,

1728
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:36,953
underlined.
It's one of the strange paradoxes of 

1729
01:17:38,901 --> 01:17:39,734
life.
One of the weird things that we have to 

1730
01:17:40,491 --> 01:17:41,324
deal with,
human beings are capable of so many 

1731
01:17:43,011 --> 01:17:43,844
weird rationalizations and this is going
back to the diffusion of responsibility 

1732
01:17:47,451 --> 01:17:49,940
thing that happens in mob mentalities.
You know,

1733
01:17:49,941 --> 01:17:50,760
with all I've,
I've,

1734
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,010
I've,
I've felt it.

1735
01:17:52,011 --> 01:17:54,620
I've seen it before where people are 
running around hitting people.

1736
01:17:54,621 --> 01:17:57,430
And when I was a kid,
I worked as a,

1737
01:17:57,431 --> 01:17:58,264
um,
a security guard at this place called 

1738
01:17:59,781 --> 01:18:01,310
great woods.
You're a Massachusetts guy.

1739
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,200
Remember Matt Mansfield,
mass,

1740
01:18:03,201 --> 01:18:04,490
Great Woods Center for the.
Yeah.

1741
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:08,490
I used to work with Bob Seger.
Would put Bon Jovi I had been to,

1742
01:18:08,491 --> 01:18:10,150
but I've been to great words.
I think we see it.

1743
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:10,910
So,
uh,

1744
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:15,910
Dan Fogelberg I saw,
I saw Rodney dangerfield there.

1745
01:18:17,210 --> 01:18:18,140
Sam kinison there.

1746
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:20,450
I saw bill cosby there.
I saw Bon Jovi.

1747
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:21,403
Big of a venue.
Can you play before people start to go 

1748
01:18:23,061 --> 01:18:23,900
like Rodney,
you,

1749
01:18:23,901 --> 01:18:24,734
you do get a lot of respect.
Like we all paid hundreds of dollars 

1750
01:18:29,490 --> 01:18:32,360
here.
Clearly make respect.

1751
01:18:32,361 --> 01:18:34,380
No respect at all.
This was in the grill,

1752
01:18:34,470 --> 01:18:35,303
barrel of cash behind my favorite Rodney
days because Rodney used to go on stage 

1753
01:18:38,481 --> 01:18:41,300
naked with a bathrobe on.
Wow.

1754
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:43,000
That's what he did towards the end he 
did.

1755
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:47,100
He decided that he was going to perform 
with a bathrobe on until he.

1756
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:51,080
And he has like a fuck you,
you can't make just what I'm doing it.

1757
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:52,760
That's what he felt like doing.
Liked it.

1758
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:55,730
Like that feeling I like and he's naked.
He was naked.

1759
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:56,683
Was it?
Could you see as Peccadillo you can be 

1760
01:18:58,130 --> 01:19:02,070
guys who were working backstage saws hog
because he's like his bathrobe.

1761
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:04,120
So he didn't give me all the time.

1762
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:05,610
You have no respect place.
He's like,

1763
01:19:05,670 --> 01:19:06,503
Hey,
I put it on the sea of people who 

1764
01:19:06,711 --> 01:19:07,690
respect me.
No,

1765
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:10,790
I just think he literally didn't give 
any fucks.

1766
01:19:10,970 --> 01:19:11,803
Zero fucks left.
He was deep into his sixties and he 

1767
01:19:15,471 --> 01:19:18,380
would go onstage with a bathroom.
That's my dad.

1768
01:19:18,730 --> 01:19:23,480
I've seen my dad's Dick more now than 
when I was a kid because he doesn't give

1769
01:19:23,481 --> 01:19:27,950
a shit how my dad isn't deaf.
He just doesn't listen.

1770
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:30,890
Like he literally don't care because he 
doesn't want to listen to him.

1771
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:32,870
I told my dad to get a hearing aid and 
he goes,

1772
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:33,883
what could you be saying?
And then resumed watching jeopardy on 

1773
01:19:37,641 --> 01:19:42,170
100.
Isn't that what could you be saying in a

1774
01:19:42,171 --> 01:19:43,004
row?
But I'm sure he was in a row but it 

1775
01:19:43,761 --> 01:19:44,690
happened.
But anyway,

1776
01:19:44,691 --> 01:19:47,140
um,
I was there and a riot brought out,

1777
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:50,110
broke out.
I was working and I was in the um,

1778
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:51,650
yeah,
great.

1779
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:54,860
Great Woods has a lawn for people don't 
know.

1780
01:19:54,861 --> 01:19:58,670
It's an outside area.
So part of it is under like a roof.

1781
01:19:58,910 --> 01:20:03,890
And then there's this back lawn area and
Neil young was playing and uh,

1782
01:20:03,891 --> 01:20:04,724
you know,
fucking stoners and burnouts were there 

1783
01:20:07,471 --> 01:20:08,160
for Neil young

1784
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:08,993
and they started fires.
They started like little these little 

1785
01:20:10,870 --> 01:20:15,870
campfires lighting papers on fire and we
had to break it up.

1786
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:16,853
And uh,
I had a Hoodie that I brought with me 

1787
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:22,500
because I always knew I'd seen a lot of 
fights and I,

1788
01:20:22,501 --> 01:20:23,334
there was a lot of altercations and I 
saw one of the security guards beat the 

1789
01:20:26,641 --> 01:20:27,474
shit out of this guy because he stole 
one of the golf course and they hit him 

1790
01:20:29,551 --> 01:20:31,860
over the head with a radio was like 
craziness.

1791
01:20:31,861 --> 01:20:34,260
I saw craziness at that place and I was 
always like,

1792
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:37,740
this is not worth $10 an hour.
Like it's a good job.

1793
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:39,750
Like to have when you're 19,
10 bucks an hour.

1794
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:40,231
I was like,
wow,

1795
01:20:40,231 --> 01:20:41,900
I got some good money.
It was good,

1796
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:44,610
but it was legitimately physically 
dangerous.

1797
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:47,010
And I was working with a bunch of other 
black belts.

1798
01:20:47,011 --> 01:20:50,400
It was all like martial arts guys that 
were working there as a security people.

1799
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:51,833
And I was a at the back area where the 
fires were and we were told to go put 

1800
01:20:57,361 --> 01:20:59,810
the fires out and we're like,
you know,

1801
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:02,620
there's radios were going off like when 
people are fires,

1802
01:21:02,621 --> 01:21:03,454
we're going to break out.
And they,

1803
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:04,710
they,
they canceled the show,

1804
01:21:04,711 --> 01:21:07,440
they stopped the show in the middle of 
the concert because of the fires.

1805
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:10,140
And then fights started breaking out and
I put the Hoodie up,

1806
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:11,053
a zipped it,
put it over my security outfit and walk 

1807
01:21:13,051 --> 01:21:15,870
right out the door.
Fuck this,

1808
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:16,704
good for you.
Because it had gotten to that weird 

1809
01:21:18,481 --> 01:21:20,020
place where like,
um,

1810
01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:22,980
I saw my friend Larry,
who's like one of the most peaceful,

1811
01:21:22,981 --> 01:21:25,800
friendly guys in the world,
told this guy to put down,

1812
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:27,540
put down,
put down a fire,

1813
01:21:27,541 --> 01:21:28,590
you know,
get the fuck away from here.

1814
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:29,640
And the guy goes,
fuck you.

1815
01:21:29,641 --> 01:21:32,460
And he punches the guy and punched him 
in the stomach and dropped them.

1816
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:37,200
And as soon as the Larry Punch somebody 
so nice because I am gone.

1817
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:38,093
I'm so out of here.
I just walked right the fuck out and 

1818
01:21:41,581 --> 01:21:43,580
quit.
See in life we need a larry.

1819
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,513
Yeah,
you need a canary in the coal mine that 

1820
01:21:45,481 --> 01:21:47,280
you go.
If Larry's throwing blows,

1821
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:48,143
well,
he was like the sweetest guy in the 

1822
01:21:48,541 --> 01:21:49,410
world.
Get the fuck.

1823
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:52,140
I mean he was a trained killer,
but he was like a super sweet guy.

1824
01:21:52,141 --> 01:21:52,974
So if him,
if he got to the point where he was so 

1825
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:56,910
on edge that he punched this guy,
I was like,

1826
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:57,833
there's no way I'm fucking.
The guy might've called him a nigger or 

1827
01:22:00,421 --> 01:22:01,590
something like that.
I think it was,

1828
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:05,160
there was so much chaos going on because
he was black and the guy was white,

1829
01:22:05,161 --> 01:22:07,320
but he,
he blast this guy and I'm like,

1830
01:22:07,321 --> 01:22:09,630
if Larry's Hinton people,
this fucking show's over.

1831
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,090
And then uh,
you know,

1832
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:12,590
we heard something over the loud 
speaker,

1833
01:22:12,591 --> 01:22:15,030
but the show stopping and people were 
going crazy.

1834
01:22:15,031 --> 01:22:18,450
We can no longer rock in the free world.
But there was this feeling.

1835
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:22,950
It was this feeling in the air of like 
terrible things can happen for sure.

1836
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:23,813
There was this feeling like,
don't get trampled where people are 

1837
01:22:27,661 --> 01:22:28,510
screaming.
No,

1838
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:31,290
not people anymore.
It's not you and one person.

1839
01:22:31,470 --> 01:22:33,330
So if it's like me and this other 
person,

1840
01:22:33,331 --> 01:22:33,871
they'd be like,
hey man,

1841
01:22:33,871 --> 01:22:35,370
relax.
So we don't have to start this fire.

1842
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:36,530
I'm going to get out of here.
Joe.

1843
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:37,513
Have a good night.
That day when I got home I ordered like 

1844
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:43,020
two months worth of earthquake food and 
I was like,

1845
01:22:43,110 --> 01:22:47,250
I don't like what we become when shit 
goes sideways.

1846
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,240
Well,
we kind of.

1847
01:22:48,850 --> 01:22:52,380
One of the things that studies have 
shown is that in natural disasters,

1848
01:22:52,381 --> 01:22:53,214
people come together,
they come together and support each 

1849
01:22:54,631 --> 01:22:55,464
other and help each other.

1850
01:22:55,590 --> 01:22:56,790
It's common,
it's really true.

1851
01:22:57,150 --> 01:22:58,890
But that the blackouts in New York,
yes.

1852
01:22:58,950 --> 01:22:59,783
It helps people help each other.
It's really like some of the best 

1853
01:23:02,611 --> 01:23:03,444
aspects of human beings do come out.
What scares me is not that what scares 

1854
01:23:07,091 --> 01:23:07,924
me is these unique moments where 
violence breaks out and there's groups 

1855
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:11,824
of people.
That's because I feel like there's a 

1856
01:23:13,151 --> 01:23:13,984
genetic memory that we have that's from 
war one on one hand to hand combat 

1857
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:23,470
warfare because our ancestors for 
thousands of years fought like that.

1858
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:27,250
They fought in these chaotic battles 
where you didn't know who the enemy was.

1859
01:23:27,251 --> 01:23:28,720
You're swinging an ax,
right?

1860
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:33,750
That is so ingrained in our genetic 
memory that I think when these riot type

1861
01:23:33,881 --> 01:23:34,714
situations break out,
like when that guy sprayed that girl in 

1862
01:23:36,341 --> 01:23:38,560
the face or hit,
they feel like that's the enemy.

1863
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:39,783
There's this instinct to just start 
swinging at people that are on another 

1864
01:23:42,430 --> 01:23:42,810
side.

1865
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:45,090
It's in our bones.
Yeah.

1866
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:47,380
I think it's a terrible thing to 
cultivate.

1867
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:50,650
It's a fairy and so in order like when 
when you,

1868
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:53,380
when you're establishing us versus them 
narratives,

1869
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:54,453
I think you.
You set an incredibly dangerous 

1870
01:23:55,811 --> 01:23:59,050
precedent because I think you tap in 
ancient genetic memory.

1871
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:00,880
That's why I'm trying to say it's not us
and them.

1872
01:24:00,881 --> 01:24:02,650
I know it just sounds like hippie 
nonsense,

1873
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:03,513
but you're right.
I put it is send us in the stake of the 

1874
01:24:06,131 --> 01:24:09,190
sixties was when the hippies were like,
it's us and it's them.

1875
01:24:09,370 --> 01:24:10,203
We need to get them when it.
When really we always need to be 

1876
01:24:12,281 --> 01:24:13,600
remembering.
It's all of us,

1877
01:24:13,850 --> 01:24:16,420
which is why it's a real problem when 
you just want to.

1878
01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:18,610
When you simply put a label on 
something,

1879
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:19,610
boom,
he's in knots.

1880
01:24:19,630 --> 01:24:19,990
I.
Right.

1881
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:22,450
Well,
these definitely not a Nazi Punch Nazis.

1882
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:23,710
Okay.
What the fuck?

1883
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:25,240
First of all,
he's not a Nazi.

1884
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:27,730
You're wrong.
And second of all,

1885
01:24:27,731 --> 01:24:30,730
if he was a Nazi,
how the fuck does someone become a Nazi?

1886
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:31,803
How does someone become now like we 
should probably figure out what makes a 

1887
01:24:34,271 --> 01:24:36,290
person like that?
The idea that you just going to fix them

1888
01:24:36,291 --> 01:24:37,300
by punching them.
No,

1889
01:24:37,301 --> 01:24:39,730
you're going to start a goddamn war.
I'm trying to get.

1890
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:40,693
His name is Christian.
I think I'm trying to get an x white 

1891
01:24:42,401 --> 01:24:45,700
supremacists to come on just for what 
you're saying.

1892
01:24:45,910 --> 01:24:46,743
I think podcasting can be powerful and 
we need to have people that can offer 

1893
01:24:49,901 --> 01:24:50,734
perspectives that you know aren't great.
Now I'd like to talk to somebody that's 

1894
01:24:54,371 --> 01:24:55,690
reformed in that way.
Well,

1895
01:24:55,691 --> 01:24:56,524
long form conversations do reveal 
certain aspects of people and you were 

1896
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:03,550
starving for it.
It's very difficult to tap into,

1897
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:04,663
you know,
if you're doing seven minutes on a late 

1898
01:25:05,921 --> 01:25:09,280
night show like Conan or something like 
that and you see sometimes people do.

1899
01:25:09,610 --> 01:25:11,980
They sort of breach these controversial 
issues and he like,

1900
01:25:11,981 --> 01:25:12,791
man,
boy,

1901
01:25:12,791 --> 01:25:16,330
you can't really do that service.
That's right in the next 45 seconds.

1902
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:20,480
I also love it because sometimes the 
joke has a two hour setup.

1903
01:25:20,850 --> 01:25:22,390
Yeah,
those episodes,

1904
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:24,580
right?
Holy Shit.

1905
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:25,653
It was like three tornadoes converging 
at the end and we didn't know you and I 

1906
01:25:29,651 --> 01:25:32,260
as stand ups or from a world where you 
have to get a laugh.

1907
01:25:32,261 --> 01:25:34,060
They have 30,
40 seconds or whatever.

1908
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,760
I've had some of the funniest things 
ever happen.

1909
01:25:37,390 --> 01:25:40,430
Two hours into a podcast and it wasn't 
even funny up until the end.

1910
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:41,740
Until the end.
Yeah.

1911
01:25:41,741 --> 01:25:43,090
Oh definitely,
definitely.

1912
01:25:43,091 --> 01:25:46,510
And also when you're two hours into it 
with another person,

1913
01:25:46,511 --> 01:25:49,120
like you know,
you and I haven't had long conversations

1914
01:25:49,121 --> 01:25:49,954
before.
So when we're having this long 

1915
01:25:50,411 --> 01:25:51,244
conversation,
I get to sort of explore how you think 

1916
01:25:52,691 --> 01:25:53,524
about things and you look at things and 
you get to see how I do and we compare 

1917
01:25:57,161 --> 01:25:58,930
notes,
we compare ideas and then,

1918
01:25:58,931 --> 01:26:01,020
you know,
my idea is get enriched your ideas,

1919
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:01,870
getting enriched.
Exactly.

1920
01:26:02,110 --> 01:26:03,920
Sort of come together and this,
each other.

1921
01:26:03,921 --> 01:26:04,190
Yeah,

1922
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:06,080
for sure.
And there again,

1923
01:26:06,081 --> 01:26:09,200
it kinda goes back to my google thing.
It's like boredom is good.

1924
01:26:09,201 --> 01:26:10,034
How I had so many.
I mapped out the whole worlds and ideas 

1925
01:26:14,631 --> 01:26:17,570
and moving ideas.
He has a kid because I was bored as shit

1926
01:26:17,571 --> 01:26:19,700
when I see the screens in the back of 
the head rest.

1927
01:26:19,701 --> 01:26:21,830
So the SUV is now.
I get it.

1928
01:26:21,831 --> 01:26:22,664
I,
I don't have kids and maybe that is 

1929
01:26:23,751 --> 01:26:24,584
something.
You just have to be like shut the fuck 

1930
01:26:25,431 --> 01:26:27,110
up and watch.
We there yet.

1931
01:26:27,111 --> 01:26:28,570
Are we there yet?
Are we there?

1932
01:26:28,571 --> 01:26:32,900
What do you want to watch?
Frozen but frozen on everybody.

1933
01:26:32,901 --> 01:26:34,020
Cheers.
It was calm.

1934
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:35,930
What is lost?
There is something,

1935
01:26:35,931 --> 01:26:36,764
some people do well with boredom.
I went to a summer camp where there was 

1936
01:26:38,751 --> 01:26:41,330
nothing and that's when I started doing 
improv.

1937
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:42,463
Well one thing for those kinds of things
you could put on educational programs 

1938
01:26:45,381 --> 01:26:48,140
for kids and they actually do enjoy 
looking for.

1939
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:50,090
I put on nature shows for my kids all 
the time.

1940
01:26:50,390 --> 01:26:52,040
They enjoy it,
but you know,

1941
01:26:52,430 --> 01:26:53,263
I think you have to engineer like when 
you say boredom engineer's certain 

1942
01:26:56,270 --> 01:26:59,750
amount of time in your life when you're 
free from all that stuff,

1943
01:26:59,751 --> 01:27:00,710
put your phone away.
Well,

1944
01:27:00,711 --> 01:27:02,420
there's a jacket,
what is the Japanese word for it?

1945
01:27:02,421 --> 01:27:04,100
I'm forgetting,
but it's a value that they have.

1946
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:07,010
The word means emptiness.
Like time.

1947
01:27:07,011 --> 01:27:09,650
It's not meditating,
it's not contemplating.

1948
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:10,753
It's just all right.
For this hour I'm just going to be open 

1949
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:16,640
and see what happens.
I think that's essential.

1950
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:19,340
We don't have that.
It's we're jammed up,

1951
01:27:19,341 --> 01:27:22,290
man.
We're jammed up and even more oil,

1952
01:27:24,670 --> 01:27:25,503
even more so jammed up when you have 
more obligations and you have a family 

1953
01:27:28,431 --> 01:27:30,590
and you have a job and you have careers 
and you know,

1954
01:27:30,591 --> 01:27:31,424
you have a podcast and you're also stand
up and you're also doing a television 

1955
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:34,633
show with a fan because I just got 
engaged and we're thinking about having 

1956
01:27:37,431 --> 01:27:38,150
kids and stuff.

1957
01:27:38,150 --> 01:27:39,980
That's one of the reasons I want to be 
married.

1958
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:43,850
And uh,
how do you find it managing because your

1959
01:27:43,851 --> 01:27:47,690
business is you and your life and your 
thoughts and your ideas.

1960
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:48,920
I manage it,
you know?

1961
01:27:48,921 --> 01:27:49,754
Um,
but it requires thought and work and 

1962
01:27:51,591 --> 01:27:52,424
effort and it takes away from some of 
the things that I would want to do more 

1963
01:27:55,731 --> 01:27:57,590
often.
And you have to shorter,

1964
01:27:57,950 --> 01:27:58,730
you know,
Louis Ck.

1965
01:27:58,730 --> 01:28:02,330
I had a great quote about being dad once
I thought was really cool because I read

1966
01:28:02,331 --> 01:28:06,290
it after I'd already sort of absorbed it
and then he and I read him saying,

1967
01:28:06,291 --> 01:28:07,250
I was like,
oh,

1968
01:28:07,251 --> 01:28:08,630
he's so right.
Said,

1969
01:28:08,631 --> 01:28:10,950
let it change you.
Interesting.

1970
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:12,890
That's beautiful.
It's a great way.

1971
01:28:13,070 --> 01:28:15,290
Great way to describe it and not to 
resist.

1972
01:28:15,370 --> 01:28:16,203
I think that because I know guys that do
resist and they wind up getting 

1973
01:28:17,961 --> 01:28:18,794
divorced,
they want to be in Shitty dads and they 

1974
01:28:20,451 --> 01:28:21,310
wind up being,
you know,

1975
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:24,260
dad's divorce don't resist because my 
wife left me.

1976
01:28:24,261 --> 01:28:27,550
That's what my hbo show is about.
What your first wife left you for?

1977
01:28:27,570 --> 01:28:29,000
Jumping right back in.
Look at you.

1978
01:28:29,790 --> 01:28:31,880
It was.
That was 10 years too soon.

1979
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:33,670
Too soon.
How old are you?

1980
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:36,200
I'm 37.
I got married when I was 22.

1981
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:37,550
Oh yeah.
Well that would work.

1982
01:28:37,630 --> 01:28:38,463
I would.

1983
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:43,550
I went to a Christian college,
like a proper youth ministry.

1984
01:28:43,551 --> 01:28:44,520
Major.
Chris.

1985
01:28:45,090 --> 01:28:46,100
Well,
that's what the show is about,

1986
01:28:46,101 --> 01:28:46,934
is about a religious guy whose wife 
leaves and then this is kind of what 

1987
01:28:49,881 --> 01:28:50,714
happened in my real life.
I got kicked into the deep end of the 

1988
01:28:52,521 --> 01:28:56,330
comedy scene.
So people like Tj Miller and Nick Kroll,

1989
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:59,720
John Malaney like rescued me when I 
didn't have anywhere to go.

1990
01:28:59,930 --> 01:29:02,070
So on the show it's fictionalized 
version

1991
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:02,903
of that.
Every episode I'm crashing on the couch 

1992
01:29:04,411 --> 01:29:06,060
of a different comedian.
Wow.

1993
01:29:06,061 --> 01:29:10,230
So you were 22.
You're hardcore Christian.

1994
01:29:10,231 --> 01:29:12,200
You meet this Gal.
She's hardcore Christian to.

1995
01:29:12,201 --> 01:29:13,650
Oh shoot.
How long were you married?

1996
01:29:14,130 --> 01:29:16,890
I was married for six years.
We dated for about a year and a half.

1997
01:29:16,950 --> 01:29:19,620
This is a true story.
I knew we were going to get married when

1998
01:29:19,621 --> 01:29:23,220
she went down on me because I could 
because I was like,

1999
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:25,230
you don't do that with someone you're 
not going to marry.

2000
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:30,700
And it was I wrong with you.
It was our engagement blow job.

2001
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:32,130
Wow.
On bended knee.

2002
01:29:32,370 --> 01:29:36,600
Hey,
you were married and then what happened?

2003
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,950
How did it go?
So that's what's interesting is,

2004
01:29:38,951 --> 01:29:39,784
is talking about letting it change you.
I remember before I had experienced any 

2005
01:29:43,051 --> 01:29:43,884
sort of suffering,
I had a pretty charmed life and then I 

2006
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:49,800
experienced some pretty severe pain and 
uh,

2007
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:52,260
and that's when I started to figure out 
who I was,

2008
01:29:52,261 --> 01:29:55,110
what I cared about and what I actually 
thought was funny.

2009
01:29:55,470 --> 01:29:56,303
So it turned out this is very unlikely 
thing made me into a much better 

2010
01:29:59,251 --> 01:30:01,290
comedian.
Plus I had way more free time.

2011
01:30:01,380 --> 01:30:02,250
Oh,
well for sure.

2012
01:30:02,251 --> 01:30:04,620
It's gonna make you a better comedian if
you could survive it.

2013
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:08,610
Like anything that's rough emotionally 
makes you a better comic if you survive.

2014
01:30:08,611 --> 01:30:09,444
That's what already already laying is in
the pilot and he's in a couple of the 

2015
01:30:11,371 --> 01:30:14,190
other episodes as well.
He's amazing and he's like,

2016
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:15,330
it's good.
You're,

2017
01:30:15,350 --> 01:30:17,300
you're,
my wife left me funny now.

2018
01:30:17,690 --> 01:30:20,280
Used to just be like,
kind of cute observational stuff.

2019
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:21,660
He's like,
you're a man now.

2020
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:23,540
Shit happened.
And he's like,

2021
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:24,413
true.
I'm,

2022
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:26,190
I stabbed myself in the heart.
Funny.

2023
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:28,290
It's like a different thing.
Did he hit his heart?

2024
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:31,230
He's trying.
He stabbed himself in the chest.

2025
01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:34,260
I'm going to be at the heart.
Seems to be doing better.

2026
01:30:34,261 --> 01:30:35,070
I mean already.

2027
01:30:35,070 --> 01:30:36,090
Yeah,
he's been on the podcast.

2028
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:37,020
He's amazing.
Yeah,

2029
01:30:37,021 --> 01:30:38,010
he's a good dude.
I was like,

2030
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:39,193
call his next book,
consummate professional because he 

2031
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:44,130
showed up early.
Nailed his lines,

2032
01:30:44,190 --> 01:30:45,930
improvised,
killed it.

2033
01:30:46,230 --> 01:30:48,690
He's a huge part of why the show got so 
funny.

2034
01:30:48,691 --> 01:30:52,290
Dude was very funny and he's a good guy.
Like he's a good guy.

2035
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,650
He has this crazy moments and all that 
jazz.

2036
01:30:54,660 --> 01:30:56,340
But.
So anyway,

2037
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,233
he's got a good heart.
Speaking of Sabic really does have a 

2038
01:30:59,281 --> 01:31:00,690
good.
He does.

2039
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:02,220
He's a sweetie.
So,

2040
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:04,020
um,
so she leaves you.

2041
01:31:04,130 --> 01:31:05,640
Yeah.
And how she leave you will.

2042
01:31:05,641 --> 01:31:08,810
She was fucking another Christian of 
her.

2043
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:10,193
Who's the other dude?
Another teacher that she worked with 

2044
01:31:12,570 --> 01:31:15,720
found Rocco.
This is all names.

2045
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:16,693
Rocco sounds like a bad play.
She fucked a boxer named rocky and I 

2046
01:31:20,990 --> 01:31:22,050
actually,
he wasn't,

2047
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,870
he wasn't a bad guy who used to like 
each,

2048
01:31:23,970 --> 01:31:25,500
like we'd get along and stuff.

2049
01:31:25,830 --> 01:31:27,810
And then how long was he banging her for
before you found out?

2050
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:29,153
Well,
that's actually because we moved 

2051
01:31:29,611 --> 01:31:30,870
upstate.
I was,

2052
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:32,213
there's a lot of elements to the story,
but we moved upstate because she was a 

2053
01:31:33,901 --> 01:31:36,300
country mouse and I'm a city boy and 
then we were like,

2054
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:38,100
oh,
let's just live in this episode of green

2055
01:31:38,101 --> 01:31:41,400
acres.
Let's just live in sleepy hollow,

2056
01:31:41,610 --> 01:31:42,443
right behind the cemetery.
It was so terrifying and I just felt 

2057
01:31:45,901 --> 01:31:46,734
this distance between us,
but I thought it was because she'd get 

2058
01:31:49,231 --> 01:31:52,380
home at like 4:00
and I'd leave at like five,

2059
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,960
6:00
to get into the city and time to do like

2060
01:31:54,961 --> 01:31:56,560
five minutes at some shitty open.
Mike.

2061
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:59,010
So how far away did you live in the city
square and seeing each other?

2062
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:00,093
Sleepy hollow is only about 45 minutes 
maybe if you're trying to lived in 

2063
01:32:02,411 --> 01:32:03,780
sleepy hollow.
Yeah.

2064
01:32:05,910 --> 01:32:06,743
Yeah.
Is it the sleepy hollow where the story 

2065
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:10,633
came from?
Yeah,

2066
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:12,910
I believe that does a lot of sleepy 
hollow's right?

2067
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,160
That uh,
that author I forget,

2068
01:32:15,161 --> 01:32:19,270
is it or I forget who wrote it.
I don't remember who,

2069
01:32:19,271 --> 01:32:20,104
but I'm a dummy and I lived there.
I believe he was buried behind my house 

2070
01:32:23,250 --> 01:32:27,460
and I lived on Gory Brook road chain was
all these things that are happening that

2071
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:30,690
made it seem like a dream.
I literally would lay on the bed because

2072
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:33,430
she's not there for me.
She's having an affair.

2073
01:32:33,431 --> 01:32:37,510
I don't know because I was just like,
it was the last thing on my mind.

2074
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:39,970
Uh,
and I thought I was dead.

2075
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:40,953
I thought I had died and gone to some 
sort of weird purgatory because you're 

2076
01:32:43,211 --> 01:32:48,211
in this new place and your small town 
and she's distant from you and you're by

2077
01:32:48,941 --> 01:32:53,320
yourself up the steepest hill to come 
home from a fucking metro north.

2078
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:57,790
It took an hour and a half round trip to
do five minutes at UCB and I'd come home

2079
01:32:57,791 --> 01:33:00,070
and she's asleep and I just like get 
drunk.

2080
01:33:00,071 --> 01:33:02,740
I was so sad.
I thought I thought I was dying.

2081
01:33:02,741 --> 01:33:03,070
I thought,
oh,

2082
01:33:03,070 --> 01:33:07,060
I guess I'll tell you a story.
One time when she was having the affair,

2083
01:33:07,061 --> 01:33:11,050
I called her and she answered the phone.
She was acting really,

2084
01:33:11,051 --> 01:33:15,220
really weird and like looking back,
the dude was clearly there.

2085
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:17,710
Who knows what they might've been mid 
boning,

2086
01:33:17,711 --> 01:33:18,820
I don't know,
and I was like,

2087
01:33:18,821 --> 01:33:22,480
you're acting weird.
And then we had a security question like

2088
01:33:22,481 --> 01:33:23,170
you,
you,

2089
01:33:23,170 --> 01:33:24,003
like in Jason Bourne,
you ask a question that they know the 

2090
01:33:26,321 --> 01:33:29,490
answer to and if they answer it wrong,
you know,

2091
01:33:30,970 --> 01:33:35,470
so I go up all the questions I go in,
what city did we get married?

2092
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:38,740
So now not only is she whipped,
the other guy,

2093
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:42,570
she's answering Trivia about our love 
boy,

2094
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:44,830
she answered it correctly and I hung up 
years,

2095
01:33:44,980 --> 01:33:45,970
you know,
when we broke up,

2096
01:33:45,971 --> 01:33:46,804
she was like,
I just don't know why I answered the 

2097
01:33:47,501 --> 01:33:48,760
phone that day,
but I,

2098
01:33:48,761 --> 01:33:50,440
I thought she was being burgled.

2099
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:51,791
Oh right,
right.

2100
01:33:51,791 --> 01:33:55,660
I guess a burglary before.
And that's how naive I was.

2101
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:58,990
Well,
I mean you just consider it kind.

2102
01:33:59,370 --> 01:34:03,670
I tried to maintain because on the show 
crashing,

2103
01:34:03,671 --> 01:34:07,420
February 19th,
hbo I on the shot and playing that guy.

2104
01:34:07,570 --> 01:34:08,403
I'm trying and it's kind of Nice.
I like going back to that time when I 

2105
01:34:10,811 --> 01:34:11,644
was,
I like to think I'm still a sweet 

2106
01:34:12,791 --> 01:34:13,624
person,
but people used to think I was on 

2107
01:34:14,921 --> 01:34:16,660
ecstasy.
You're definitely a sweet person.

2108
01:34:16,790 --> 01:34:20,110
Why would you think you're not?
I don't know how you're a grownup now.

2109
01:34:20,111 --> 01:34:22,420
I've lost my temper,
but you got an edge now.

2110
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:25,330
I wouldn't even say I have an edge,
but I mean I don't fuck around with some

2111
01:34:25,331 --> 01:34:26,164
things.
Like sometimes like I'll get into a 

2112
01:34:28,211 --> 01:34:31,420
fight with my mother because mom.
Did you ever say that?

2113
01:34:31,421 --> 01:34:33,310
I've never said fuck.
You mean that would be.

2114
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:34,780
Have never said fuck him.
I'm learning.

2115
01:34:34,781 --> 01:34:36,310
The only thing I've raised my voice or 
my mom,

2116
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:37,593
I haven't raised my voice,
but I get angry in a way that I never 

2117
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:40,924
would have because you become a grownup 
at a certain point and it's a bit of a 

2118
01:34:43,211 --> 01:34:44,170
bummer,
but you're like,

2119
01:34:44,910 --> 01:34:45,860
Shit.
Yeah.

2120
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:50,470
Like my mom always asks about my dog.
I have a dog and she,

2121
01:34:50,830 --> 01:34:51,663
we never had a dog.
So I honestly think my mom thinks I 

2122
01:34:53,561 --> 01:34:56,800
don't know how to raise a dog,
so I'll tell her on the phone.

2123
01:34:56,801 --> 01:34:57,634
I'll just be like,
mom,

2124
01:34:58,050 --> 01:34:59,330
we're going to go.
She's like,

2125
01:34:59,331 --> 01:35:00,081
what are you up to you?
I'm just like,

2126
01:35:00,081 --> 01:35:00,591
oh,
you know,

2127
01:35:00,591 --> 01:35:02,600
a val and I are going to go get some 
lunch or whatever,

2128
01:35:02,601 --> 01:35:04,340
and she's like,
is brody coming?

2129
01:35:04,910 --> 01:35:08,690
What are you going to do with the dog?
And all I'm hearing is like,

2130
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:10,130
you can't handle a dog.

2131
01:35:10,130 --> 01:35:12,560
Like it just feels like this attack and 
I'll just be like,

2132
01:35:12,561 --> 01:35:14,720
mom,
I've told you a thousand times,

2133
01:35:14,721 --> 01:35:16,310
so I try to make jokes.
I'm like,

2134
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:17,293
well,
I'm going to keep brody into an active 

2135
01:35:18,051 --> 01:35:21,950
volcano and I'm going to cut off his 
head so he doesn't have to suffer,

2136
01:35:21,951 --> 01:35:22,784
you know,
while we're gone and she doesn't like 

2137
01:35:23,601 --> 01:35:24,434
that.
So we butt heads in a way that we never 

2138
01:35:25,581 --> 01:35:27,200
did.
That's interesting to know.

2139
01:35:27,230 --> 01:35:30,080
Your mom was at her idea to raise you 
super religious?

2140
01:35:30,650 --> 01:35:31,370
Yeah,
there's,

2141
01:35:31,370 --> 01:35:33,800
there's definitely some latent 
resentment there too.

2142
01:35:33,801 --> 01:35:35,660
And I got married because my mom was 
like,

2143
01:35:35,661 --> 01:35:37,880
you should get married.
That's just true.

2144
01:35:38,270 --> 01:35:41,150
We went to Chili's in Burlington.
Maybe you've been there.

2145
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:42,200
Children,
Tim Vermont,

2146
01:35:42,230 --> 01:35:43,070
Burlington,
mass.

2147
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:46,580
Right by the mall.
I know Burlington coat factory.

2148
01:35:47,030 --> 01:35:51,890
They're more than great coats.
We went and I had the Nacho Burger.

2149
01:35:51,891 --> 01:35:54,440
It's Nacho ordinary burger.
And my mom was like,

2150
01:35:54,441 --> 01:35:55,130
you should get married.

2151
01:35:55,130 --> 01:35:55,791
And I was like,
okay,

2152
01:35:55,791 --> 01:35:58,070
that's how much of a mama's boy I went.
Wow.

2153
01:35:58,100 --> 01:35:58,933
Because I was 22,
I was moving to Chicago to do Improv 

2154
01:36:01,790 --> 01:36:03,920
because I heard the story of Chris 
Farley,

2155
01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:05,053
he moves from Madison to Chicago.
He gets us an out and that's what I 

2156
01:36:07,551 --> 01:36:08,900
wanted to do.
So I was like,

2157
01:36:08,901 --> 01:36:09,734
I'm going to move to Chicago.
I'm not going to break up with my wife 

2158
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:14,490
or my girlfriend at the time.
And I didn't know if I,

2159
01:36:14,510 --> 01:36:16,280
if we could live in sin,
you know what I mean?

2160
01:36:16,281 --> 01:36:17,930
Like I didn't know if I can make that 
move.

2161
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:19,250
So she was like,
just get married.

2162
01:36:19,610 --> 01:36:20,900
It's fine.
And I,

2163
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:22,310
you know,
I,

2164
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:26,690
I get where she was coming from,
but I do think there's some latent like,

2165
01:36:27,140 --> 01:36:29,210
hey,
maybe it'd be like,

2166
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:32,090
just live in sin for a while.
See how that goes.

2167
01:36:32,990 --> 01:36:34,190
It's hard for some people.

2168
01:36:34,190 --> 01:36:35,300
It's not an option.
You know?

2169
01:36:35,301 --> 01:36:36,134
Some people that are really religious in
the last thing she would want to do is 

2170
01:36:37,821 --> 01:36:40,490
tell her friends,
well that's what the church,

2171
01:36:41,030 --> 01:36:43,250
it's the,
it's the expectation of like,

2172
01:36:43,340 --> 01:36:45,470
you can't have a son who's living with 
this girl.

2173
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:46,333
Like I was the golden boy.
I don't know how you were in your 

2174
01:36:48,531 --> 01:36:50,200
family,
but I was like her,

2175
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:53,870
like it was so clear that she loved me 
the most.

2176
01:36:53,890 --> 01:36:56,780
Like she's like obsessed with me and 
we're still close,

2177
01:36:56,990 --> 01:36:59,150
but she,
she kinda guided me in that way.

2178
01:36:59,930 --> 01:37:00,763
But that's kind what crashing is about.
It's like these things that you would 

2179
01:37:03,291 --> 01:37:06,950
never ask for taking you to the place 
you were afraid to go.

2180
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:08,780
So she leaves,
you know,

2181
01:37:09,110 --> 01:37:11,480
how'd you find out?
She told me.

2182
01:37:11,550 --> 01:37:13,730
Well,
she took me to dinner hollow.

2183
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:17,540
She got me linguine with clams,
which was my favorite dishes.

2184
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:19,830
Is it really good?
A lovey and I still eat.

2185
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:21,410
Hardly ever do,
but when I do,

2186
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:22,240
yeah,
I know what you mean.

2187
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:23,073
Treat.
I know he been trying not to eat the 

2188
01:37:24,141 --> 01:37:25,080
pasta,
but when I do,

2189
01:37:26,410 --> 01:37:28,130
yeah,
it's almost worth it.

2190
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:31,370
It's worth it.
So we got that.

2191
01:37:31,371 --> 01:37:33,650
And then it's,
it's a sad story.

2192
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:38,480
She also took me to a liquor store to 
buy alcohol for that night.

2193
01:37:38,481 --> 01:37:40,250
I don't know what's going on.
I'm like,

2194
01:37:40,251 --> 01:37:43,190
the puppy that's getting driven to the 
vet to be put down.

2195
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:45,360
And then we went home and she had a 
left,

2196
01:37:45,361 --> 01:37:48,080
she had a script and she goes,
uh,

2197
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:50,120
I love you.
I want what's best for you.

2198
01:37:50,121 --> 01:37:50,631
And I'm like,
Oh hey,

2199
01:37:50,631 --> 01:37:51,770
thanks.
And she was like,

2200
01:37:51,850 --> 01:37:52,683
uh,
you deserve to be with someone who 

2201
01:37:53,571 --> 01:37:54,770
really loves you.
And I'm like,

2202
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:56,100
I agree.
Yeah,

2203
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:59,190
I'm glad to just not getting Jesus 
Christ.

2204
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:01,830
Number three was,
I don't want to be a cheating wife.

2205
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:03,180
And I go,
so don't be.

2206
01:38:03,870 --> 01:38:04,703
That was my response.
And then she was dead silent and then I 

2207
01:38:07,621 --> 01:38:09,600
was like,
is there someone else?

2208
01:38:09,601 --> 01:38:10,434
I said it as a joke,
like I felt like I was in a TV show and 

2209
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:16,020
I was like,
is there someone else like,

2210
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:19,470
as if that could be a thing.
Her silence was deafening.

2211
01:38:19,780 --> 01:38:20,970
And then I swear to God,
Joe,

2212
01:38:20,971 --> 01:38:23,070
my next question was,
is it a comedian?

2213
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:25,770
And she goes,
no,

2214
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:28,260
and I go,
this is later in the conversation.

2215
01:38:28,261 --> 01:38:30,150
I go,
you're leaving me for us civilian.

2216
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:31,253
Oh God.

2217
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:34,820
See,
I love comedians.

2218
01:38:34,821 --> 01:38:39,680
How could you date a comedian and hang 
out with my comedian friends and we'd go

2219
01:38:39,681 --> 01:38:40,520
to shows.
And it's,

2220
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:42,890
I love show business.
I love comedy.

2221
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:46,500
How could you leave the best thing,
the best people?

2222
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:48,110
Wow.
So what?

2223
01:38:48,111 --> 01:38:49,820
I thought.
That's ridiculous.

2224
01:38:50,950 --> 01:38:51,990
Oh,
you don't agree with me.

2225
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,470
You think that's stupid?
Well,

2226
01:38:54,530 --> 01:38:56,040
that comedians are fun.
Well,

2227
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:59,120
I'm sure they're fun for some people.
The idea that the only,

2228
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:03,050
I mean obviously I'm sure I probably 
would've thought at the time too,

2229
01:39:03,051 --> 01:39:06,380
if you talked to me when I was 22 it 20,
or when I was 28.

2230
01:39:06,530 --> 01:39:09,800
I think when you're really deep in love 
with something,

2231
01:39:09,860 --> 01:39:12,320
it becomes the only world that you can 
imagine.

2232
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:16,110
Well,
that now with my current fiance,

2233
01:39:16,230 --> 01:39:20,760
French for wife,
I don't know if it's a comedy bit.

2234
01:39:20,890 --> 01:39:22,590
Oh,
it's a comedy joke for bits.

2235
01:39:22,820 --> 01:39:24,870
Um,
I just laugh at that one too.

2236
01:39:25,530 --> 01:39:27,330
I will lend Jay,
you will kill me,

2237
01:39:27,331 --> 01:39:29,070
but I will lend you to you.
I'll get one good line,

2238
01:39:29,071 --> 01:39:32,880
jen.
I feel like any comedian,

2239
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:35,670
uh,
is in a threeway there's something where

2240
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:39,930
there's this other thing and it really 
helps if Valerie likes to fuck comedy as

2241
01:39:39,931 --> 01:39:41,350
well,
and she does well.

2242
01:39:41,370 --> 01:39:43,140
That's interesting.
She likes traveling,

2243
01:39:43,141 --> 01:39:45,900
she likes the,
she likes my friends.

2244
01:39:46,290 --> 01:39:47,123
She likes it.
If she can get me a bed or try out 

2245
01:39:48,991 --> 01:39:49,950
something together,

2246
01:39:50,030 --> 01:39:50,863
that's cool.
She actually can come up with some shit 

2247
01:39:52,910 --> 01:39:54,740
too.
That's really fun to watch you do it.

2248
01:39:54,741 --> 01:39:55,670
That's got to be really fun.

2249
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:58,900
Nothing better than doing the show.
And you know,

2250
01:39:59,110 --> 01:40:01,000
at Largo,
I have a monthly show at Largo and she's

2251
01:40:01,001 --> 01:40:01,834
sitting on the stage,
but behind the curtain and hearing her 

2252
01:40:04,211 --> 01:40:06,220
laugh and I'm riffing and she'll,
she'll,

2253
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:08,290
I never asked her to.
But God,

2254
01:40:08,291 --> 01:40:11,200
it really made me,
made our love that much deeper.

2255
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:13,960
She just started writing down.
If I set a new line,

2256
01:40:14,110 --> 01:40:15,130
she just emailed him.
Wow,

2257
01:40:15,131 --> 01:40:16,480
that's cool to me.
And I was like,

2258
01:40:16,780 --> 01:40:18,190
Oh,
let's get married.

2259
01:40:20,170 --> 01:40:21,730
That's cool.
We should be married.

2260
01:40:22,330 --> 01:40:23,163
You know,
there's a weird thing that happens to a 

2261
01:40:24,611 --> 01:40:28,930
lot of comedians when they get involved 
in a relationship like a first.

2262
01:40:28,931 --> 01:40:31,720
The girl thinks it's cool,
like I'm dating this guy.

2263
01:40:31,730 --> 01:40:33,580
He's just.
He's a comedian.

2264
01:40:33,581 --> 01:40:35,170
He's wild.
He's so funny.

2265
01:40:35,171 --> 01:40:38,710
He says funny things and then it becomes
you have to work every night.

2266
01:40:38,750 --> 01:40:40,110
That's funny.
You have to work tonight.

2267
01:40:40,180 --> 01:40:42,070
Why don't you just stay home,
stay home with me.

2268
01:40:42,071 --> 01:40:43,290
I have the night off.
I've

2269
01:40:43,290 --> 01:40:45,190
been in relationships like that.
I have to,

2270
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:46,950
and this isn't.
I'm glad this isn't one of them,

2271
01:40:46,951 --> 01:40:50,370
but I've also calmed down.
I wonder if you have at a certain point,

2272
01:40:50,371 --> 01:40:51,204
I'm happy to report to our species 
comedians that I think there is a level 

2273
01:40:56,081 --> 01:40:58,600
that you reach where you relax a little 
bit.

2274
01:40:58,840 --> 01:40:59,673
You've,
you've gone in the fancy green room and 

2275
01:41:01,691 --> 01:41:03,940
you've eaten the apple pie and you just 
go like,

2276
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:05,490
okay,
I've.

2277
01:41:05,491 --> 01:41:06,940
I've seen the strings at the puppet 
show.

2278
01:41:06,941 --> 01:41:07,774
We can keep playing the game,
but I'm not as desperate or afraid as I 

2279
01:41:11,471 --> 01:41:12,670
used to be.
I'm like,

2280
01:41:12,671 --> 01:41:14,380
it's a marathon.
There's ups,

2281
01:41:14,381 --> 01:41:18,490
there's downs and there's a lot of other
shit to life than comedy.

2282
01:41:18,820 --> 01:41:21,820
I don't do sets every night anyway.
That's kind of like A.

2283
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:25,390
I'm like a three times a week ago.
I think three times a week is fine.

2284
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:27,590
I don't do it every night either.
Um,

2285
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:28,473
but I think the discipline,
when you are confident in your 

2286
01:41:31,601 --> 01:41:32,434
discipline,
it can mitigate some of the negative 

2287
01:41:35,171 --> 01:41:37,750
aspects of obsession because like,
you know,

2288
01:41:37,751 --> 01:41:39,280
you're doing the work,
you're putting in the work.

2289
01:41:39,281 --> 01:41:40,930
Like you don't feel bad taking a night 
off.

2290
01:41:40,990 --> 01:41:42,030
That's right.
We got,

2291
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:42,953
you know what somebody said that really 
changed the game for me was live a life 

2292
01:41:45,791 --> 01:41:47,440
worth commenting on.
That's good.

2293
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:49,960
You can't just go out and next thing you
know,

2294
01:41:49,961 --> 01:41:52,360
you're just doing bits about motels,
hotels,

2295
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:56,050
holiday inns and fucking airplanes.
I get that.

2296
01:41:56,290 --> 01:41:57,123
But if I just go to a concert or just go
camping or just go on a trip and have 

2297
01:42:03,461 --> 01:42:05,020
not.
And not even thinking like,

2298
01:42:05,021 --> 01:42:05,854
could I get a bed out of this?
I can go to a sensory deprivation tank 

2299
01:42:08,381 --> 01:42:10,510
and not go,
what's the bit here?

2300
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:13,390
Oh,
salt on my asshole.

2301
01:42:13,450 --> 01:42:14,800
I'm not thinking that,
I'm just like,

2302
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:17,740
this is life and that's,
that's.

2303
01:42:17,741 --> 01:42:19,360
I think that's the way we should be.
We can't.

2304
01:42:19,810 --> 01:42:24,810
There is this three way thing going on,
but I'm not as starved anymore.

2305
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:27,370
Do you remember some balance?
It's definitely a balance,

2306
01:42:27,430 --> 01:42:28,263
but when you started,
that's kind of one of the other things 

2307
01:42:29,981 --> 01:42:33,190
that show is about is that fervor that 
you have when you're starting,

2308
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:35,410
where you're like,
it actually got cut,

2309
01:42:35,411 --> 01:42:36,244
but there was a scene we wrote where it 
was like if you're holding your 

2310
01:42:37,931 --> 01:42:38,764
girlfriend in one hand and comedy and 
the other which will and lauren lap 

2311
01:42:41,621 --> 01:42:44,560
guests who plays my wife did this really
funny ref because she's like,

2312
01:42:44,561 --> 01:42:47,860
if you're holding me and you're holding 
comedy over a cliff,

2313
01:42:48,070 --> 01:42:48,903
which one you pull up like the good son 
and I had to think about it and while 

2314
01:42:51,761 --> 01:42:52,594
I'm thinking about it,
she just knows she's bawling and she's 

2315
01:42:56,051 --> 01:42:56,790
right.

2316
01:42:56,790 --> 01:42:57,623
That there's something.
I hope that people when they watch the 

2317
01:42:59,651 --> 01:43:01,630
show,
I understand that.

2318
01:43:01,631 --> 01:43:06,130
I understand why my wife left me in real
life and also why the character,

2319
01:43:06,370 --> 01:43:09,080
the kind of pretend wife on the show.
Also left.

2320
01:43:09,110 --> 01:43:11,230
I think that's the same with rock and 
roll.

2321
01:43:11,231 --> 01:43:12,064
I think it's probably the same with art.
I think it's probably the same with 

2322
01:43:14,620 --> 01:43:17,920
everything that you become obsessed with
sometimes when people were involved in a

2323
01:43:17,921 --> 01:43:19,510
relationship,
especially when they're young.

2324
01:43:20,170 --> 01:43:21,003
It seems like your whole world to a 
person who doesn't have this other 

2325
01:43:25,031 --> 01:43:26,170
obsession,
like comedy,

2326
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:27,333
like say if you have just a regular job,
you're working at an insurance company 

2327
01:43:29,681 --> 01:43:31,270
or something like that and your 
boyfriend's a comedian,

2328
01:43:31,271 --> 01:43:32,104
your girlfriend's a comedian and you 
just want to get home and have dinner 

2329
01:43:35,021 --> 01:43:35,854
and sit down with them and they have to 
rush off to the city to do some fucking 

2330
01:43:38,171 --> 01:43:40,180
sat and he won't be home until 2:00
in the morning.

2331
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:41,380
Not Great.
It's not good.

2332
01:43:41,710 --> 01:43:43,360
It's not what you want it.
Yeah.

2333
01:43:43,361 --> 01:43:44,194
It has it in real life.
My wife said I don't want to be Pete 

2334
01:43:46,630 --> 01:43:49,750
Holmes is why I kinda get it.
I get it.

2335
01:43:49,780 --> 01:43:51,770
Like even at the time I was like the 
sex,

2336
01:43:51,771 --> 01:43:53,450
but I kinda get it.
Makes Sense.

2337
01:43:53,970 --> 01:43:54,803
That makes sense.
And then someone might want to be 

2338
01:43:56,781 --> 01:43:57,710
though.
That's the thing.

2339
01:43:57,711 --> 01:43:58,340
It's like,
yeah,

2340
01:43:58,340 --> 01:43:59,173
no matter what there is about your life,
it's about finding someone who can 

2341
01:44:03,021 --> 01:44:05,300
appreciate whatever that is about your 
life and help you.

2342
01:44:05,550 --> 01:44:06,383
Yeah,
I know it's typically something people 

2343
01:44:07,341 --> 01:44:08,174
say about kids,
but like seeing the world through their 

2344
01:44:09,711 --> 01:44:12,260
eyes.
Like we go talk about the four seasons.

2345
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:13,133
Okay.
You do a corporate gig and they put you 

2346
01:44:13,731 --> 01:44:14,564
up at the four seasons and you and I 
have done that before you bring the new 

2347
01:44:18,561 --> 01:44:19,910
person,
the excited person.

2348
01:44:19,910 --> 01:44:22,490
It's so fun to surprise Valerie with 
that.

2349
01:44:22,491 --> 01:44:23,324
It's so fun to go to the show together.
I just did a corporate and it was 

2350
01:44:25,851 --> 01:44:27,350
brutal.
I got the back sweat,

2351
01:44:27,351 --> 01:44:28,250
dry mouth.
It just,

2352
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:29,270
you know,
they're never great.

2353
01:44:29,330 --> 01:44:30,163
Right.
Those things.

2354
01:44:30,230 --> 01:44:34,610
And she was there and we laugh about.
It's like we should share the adventure.

2355
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:35,713
She has her own thing.
She works for a charity called real 

2356
01:44:36,861 --> 01:44:38,870
girl,
which is a female empowerment program.

2357
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:41,240
Uh,
I know feminism is a cancer.

2358
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:43,580
I'm just kidding.
But that's what she does.

2359
01:44:43,581 --> 01:44:44,414
But it's flexible enough that we can,
we can go to New York and filmed the 

2360
01:44:47,121 --> 01:44:50,850
show and come to La and do shows in 
Hawaii or whatever it might be.

2361
01:44:50,860 --> 01:44:51,740
That's awesome,
man.

2362
01:44:51,741 --> 01:44:52,610
You,
you found some.

2363
01:44:52,611 --> 01:44:56,240
I think I've always made this analogy 
that people are kind of like the fingers

2364
01:44:56,241 --> 01:45:00,200
of two hands and if they fall together 
like that where it's a perfect fit.

2365
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:01,333
You're,
you're in,

2366
01:45:01,370 --> 01:45:03,320
you're in.
But a lot of times people get this thing

2367
01:45:03,321 --> 01:45:06,400
going on where you get those bottom two 
fingers with the top two fingers.

2368
01:45:06,410 --> 01:45:08,610
On the other hand is a lot of wildland 
fire.

2369
01:45:08,860 --> 01:45:10,070
Missed high five.
It's.

2370
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:11,240
Yeah,
exactly.

2371
01:45:11,241 --> 01:45:11,691
You know,
it's funny,

2372
01:45:11,691 --> 01:45:14,420
the last person that did that for me,
again,

2373
01:45:14,660 --> 01:45:18,080
the crashing is about these stories of 
when you're starting and when it sucks.

2374
01:45:18,081 --> 01:45:20,240
I really think that's kind of the most 
interesting thing.

2375
01:45:20,540 --> 01:45:21,373
A lot of shows that I love about 
comedians are about comedians when 

2376
01:45:23,961 --> 01:45:25,970
they're successful and that's fine.
That's great.

2377
01:45:26,270 --> 01:45:29,780
This is a show about these times and 
when I was opening for Bill Burr,

2378
01:45:29,930 --> 01:45:32,900
and this is 10 years ago,
I was in Peoria.

2379
01:45:32,940 --> 01:45:33,773
I actually made a youtube video of it 
called Pete Holmes bombing where I kind 

2380
01:45:36,051 --> 01:45:39,400
of do commentary on it when I got off 
stage,

2381
01:45:39,410 --> 01:45:41,930
he was like,
you want it to be like this,

2382
01:45:41,990 --> 01:45:42,823
but you were like this like the whole 
time just describing it to people you 

2383
01:45:46,221 --> 01:45:48,380
want it to be like the hands intersect 
perfectly,

2384
01:45:48,381 --> 01:45:51,710
but the fingertips are smashing into 
each other and he was absolutely right.

2385
01:45:51,930 --> 01:45:52,763
You know when you're bombing and it just
feels like the words are just getting 

2386
01:45:54,891 --> 01:45:57,860
sucked into a vacuum.
There's no connection.

2387
01:45:57,890 --> 01:45:58,723
Well,
you have no connection with it so the 

2388
01:45:59,451 --> 01:46:00,284
audience is never going to have a 
connection with it and it's impossible 

2389
01:46:01,821 --> 01:46:02,654
for you to have a connection with 
because you know you're bombing and 

2390
01:46:03,861 --> 01:46:04,694
you're pretending to have a good time.
And here's the rub is my comedy 

2391
01:46:08,090 --> 01:46:10,250
typically comes from a positive place.
Like,

2392
01:46:10,251 --> 01:46:11,084
um,
I like to lean into my sweetness and my 

2393
01:46:12,861 --> 01:46:15,590
enthusiasm and wonder.
So if I,

2394
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:16,453
like,
this happened I was at in Irvine and I 

2395
01:46:17,871 --> 01:46:21,460
was onstage and I had this bid about a 
Lululemon.

2396
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:23,630
This hoodie that I'm actually wearing is
a Lulu lemon.

2397
01:46:23,631 --> 01:46:25,880
I just like Lulu Lemon,
who fucking cares.

2398
01:46:26,090 --> 01:46:28,500
So I have a bit about it though.
Like any comedian.

2399
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:30,950
So it's my opener.
Sometimes I go,

2400
01:46:31,190 --> 01:46:33,590
this is a Lulu Lemon,
I just don't want you wondering.

2401
01:46:33,591 --> 01:46:38,150
The whole show.
And then the setup of the next joke is I

2402
01:46:38,151 --> 01:46:41,030
think I think people like ladies,
like a guy in a Lulu,

2403
01:46:41,150 --> 01:46:43,520
it says something about them and then 
this girl,

2404
01:46:43,550 --> 01:46:45,740
this isn't the first 30 seconds of my 
first,

2405
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:48,770
first row girl big table because you're 
gay,

2406
01:46:49,470 --> 01:46:50,303
you're gay.

2407
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:52,320
And I just kind of wiped it out and was 
like,

2408
01:46:52,321 --> 01:46:55,080
it's 2016.
How you're fucking ignorant.

2409
01:46:55,090 --> 01:46:55,923
Like just kinda like what it.
People were laughing but I was just 

2410
01:46:58,441 --> 01:47:02,700
leaned into her and then I had to try to
merge back into my silly,

2411
01:47:02,701 --> 01:47:04,980
silly,
fun boy comedy routine.

2412
01:47:05,250 --> 01:47:08,010
I literally have a light in my act back 
then where I go,

2413
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:10,590
I don't know how to be angry.
It's.

2414
01:47:10,591 --> 01:47:15,120
And that's usually like a big laugh.
They'd already seen me be very angry.

2415
01:47:15,121 --> 01:47:18,910
You got mad when she said you're gay 
because of a Lululemon lawn.

2416
01:47:19,370 --> 01:47:20,203
When you just assume that that's seems 
like that's what someone would say it 

2417
01:47:23,450 --> 01:47:26,610
maybe if I last for 35 seconds,
but you left the gap,

2418
01:47:27,080 --> 01:47:29,840
right?
Are you siding with this crazy woman?

2419
01:47:29,940 --> 01:47:31,550
It's a heckle,
obviously.

2420
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:32,393
Never side with a heckler in the first 
30 seconds and I'm doing the setup and 

2421
01:47:36,091 --> 01:47:36,924
you go,
you're gay or was there someone on 

2422
01:47:38,010 --> 01:47:38,843
before you?

2423
01:47:38,980 --> 01:47:39,813
Yeah,
the two opening.

2424
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:42,960
So they were drinking,
so this lady probably lit up.

2425
01:47:43,470 --> 01:47:44,910
You get on,
she's been hearing people say,

2426
01:47:44,911 --> 01:47:45,744
shit,
that's marginally funny because they're 

2427
01:47:46,501 --> 01:47:48,090
not as funny as you because of the 
openers.

2428
01:47:48,510 --> 01:47:50,160
And she's like,
I think I can find.

2429
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:54,300
I'm fine.
He says,

2430
01:47:54,301 --> 01:47:55,390
you're gay.
Hate is.

2431
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:58,570
I think it says something about me.
Right.

2432
01:47:58,830 --> 01:48:00,330
That's so obvious.
Yeah,

2433
01:48:00,331 --> 01:48:02,580
you're gay.
Everybody would say that.

2434
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:06,810
And 90 nine point nine percent of the 
time people have the decency to go.

2435
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:09,450
It's probably going somewhere guard 
against the guard.

2436
01:48:09,451 --> 01:48:11,040
Against that one.
10th of one percent.

2437
01:48:11,340 --> 01:48:12,650
Yeah.
Come up with a better name.

2438
01:48:12,890 --> 01:48:16,860
You know what I can counter argue.
Don't do that for sure.

2439
01:48:16,890 --> 01:48:18,690
Remain vulnerable.
One hundred percent.

2440
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:19,930
Get heckled.
Yeah.

2441
01:48:20,010 --> 01:48:20,843
Get some scars.
That's okay because I don't like 

2442
01:48:22,111 --> 01:48:23,520
bulletproof comedians.
Well,

2443
01:48:23,521 --> 01:48:25,260
you're not.
You're never bulletproof.

2444
01:48:25,290 --> 01:48:26,123
First of all,
and second of all prepare for someone 

2445
01:48:28,261 --> 01:48:29,880
saying you're gay because it's coming 
again.

2446
01:48:29,910 --> 01:48:32,140
That Joe 100 percent.
I.

2447
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:34,860
So do you have a.
Did you have a backup line?

2448
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:38,670
Like when she said you're gay?
If I had been in a better mood,

2449
01:48:38,850 --> 01:48:42,450
maybe I would have had mode,
but I don't know homophobia,

2450
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:43,553
like I hate the word,
but it's that homophobic to say that it 

2451
01:48:46,561 --> 01:48:48,480
says you're gay.
There's nothing wrong with being gay,

2452
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:49,433
so there's nothing wrong with being gay 
and gay people are very fashionable and 

2453
01:48:52,411 --> 01:48:56,480
someone says something about you.
Let's unpack that a little bit.

2454
01:48:56,780 --> 01:48:57,613
I do take offense at the idea that 
people into gentler or more flowy yoga 

2455
01:49:03,631 --> 01:49:04,464
meditation,
things are therefore weaker and being 

2456
01:49:07,531 --> 01:49:08,364
weak is like being gay and being gay is 
like being Frou Frou or like a ferry or 

2457
01:49:12,301 --> 01:49:13,134
whatever you want to say.
If you make an offensive to a group of 

2458
01:49:14,671 --> 01:49:15,570
people,
that makes sense,

2459
01:49:15,571 --> 01:49:18,810
but you're making a giant leap by saying
that someone is into Lulu Lemon,

2460
01:49:18,811 --> 01:49:19,644
which is really nice.
Clothes that make really good fitness 

2461
01:49:21,301 --> 01:49:22,170
clothes,
sure,

2462
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:24,390
and that that somehow or another is 
weak.

2463
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:25,313
I don't think it's weak at all,
but it's called Lulu Lemon Joe Lulu 

2464
01:49:29,251 --> 01:49:30,084
lemon shirt,
but the point is that women assume that 

2465
01:49:34,321 --> 01:49:35,154
men who are really fashionable or into 
fashion and understand and appreciate 

2466
01:49:39,350 --> 01:49:41,990
fashion yet,
but then times 10,

2467
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:42,893
can we talk about black people love 
fried chicken and watermelon fried 

2468
01:49:45,961 --> 01:49:48,280
chicken is delicious because everybody 
loves fried

2469
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:51,600
chicken and large groups of people that 
aren't gay like looking fashionable.

2470
01:49:52,180 --> 01:49:54,400
Right?
So what's going to be allowed to make?

2471
01:49:54,920 --> 01:49:57,700
Then I discouraged that.
I agree with you.

2472
01:49:57,790 --> 01:50:01,030
I agree with him also saying I defend my
right to discourage.

2473
01:50:01,031 --> 01:50:01,864
I agree with you,
but I think that if you are a standup 

2474
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:08,020
comedian working in a unit that sells 
alcohol,

2475
01:50:08,050 --> 01:50:11,080
I feel like the student being taught by 
the message.

2476
01:50:11,110 --> 01:50:12,220
That is true,
right?

2477
01:50:12,310 --> 01:50:13,143
I should've been like,
you got to say you left it open like I 

2478
01:50:16,171 --> 01:50:18,700
would if I was your friend spur of a 
second.

2479
01:50:18,730 --> 01:50:23,460
Too Long in the $30 to come see me and 
you're like,

2480
01:50:23,461 --> 01:50:25,450
I'm going to fuck this guy shit up.
Well,

2481
01:50:25,451 --> 01:50:28,900
it's just natural.
It's a natural,

2482
01:50:28,901 --> 01:50:29,734
wise ass thing to say by someone who has
like one person at the office to do 

2483
01:50:33,341 --> 01:50:35,680
better.
I want us to to do.

2484
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:41,800
I expect my audiences to be better.
I want the clubs to be better.

2485
01:50:41,801 --> 01:50:45,820
I want us to elevate our game.
The people always like to say do better.

2486
01:50:45,821 --> 01:50:46,654
You know what's another thing that 
people like to say that's really 

2487
01:50:47,891 --> 01:50:50,640
disturbing?
The worst is the worst.

2488
01:50:51,670 --> 01:50:54,910
The worst is being eaten.
Asshole first by hyenas.

2489
01:50:54,911 --> 01:50:56,470
Okay.
That's the worst.

2490
01:50:56,660 --> 01:50:59,130
Anything other than that?
We really stopped calling it the worst.

2491
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:01,280
People love to say that.
Oh,

2492
01:51:01,390 --> 01:51:03,600
Pete Holmes.
The worst that guys.

2493
01:51:03,610 --> 01:51:06,010
The worst.
He had a joke about homophobia.

2494
01:51:06,011 --> 01:51:10,270
He's the worst.
It's such an overused term.

2495
01:51:10,271 --> 01:51:11,104
It's so stupid.
He cut her term that people are using 

2496
01:51:14,111 --> 01:51:16,210
today where they just throw it in.
Oh,

2497
01:51:16,211 --> 01:51:17,770
you're the worst.
I'm going to join.

2498
01:51:17,771 --> 01:51:18,604
You know,
I think people have arrested 

2499
01:51:20,561 --> 01:51:21,520
development.
Literally.

2500
01:51:21,521 --> 01:51:22,354
They stopped for sure developing.
So in fifth grade you realize that you 

2501
01:51:25,301 --> 01:51:27,520
could win friends by keeping your shoe's
untied.

2502
01:51:27,610 --> 01:51:29,440
You're a bad boy.
And also being like,

2503
01:51:30,700 --> 01:51:32,680
you didn't have the cool kid with the 
untied shoes.

2504
01:51:32,830 --> 01:51:34,480
No Man.
Never.

2505
01:51:34,510 --> 01:51:37,450
Alright then let's just untie your 
confusing as shit.

2506
01:51:37,451 --> 01:51:38,284
I mean Jamie,
you with them on this January kid who 

2507
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:40,753
doesn't give a shit as easy as you can.
Even just when it comes to shoes tied 

2508
01:51:43,631 --> 01:51:44,470
shoe thing,
for sure.

2509
01:51:44,980 --> 01:51:46,870
The kid who doesn't give a fuck.
I'm older than you.

2510
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:48,010
Maybe.
Maybe I missed that.

2511
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:48,873
That's true.
The kid who didn't tie his horse to the 

2512
01:51:49,931 --> 01:51:52,150
stable and that was the guy that,
you know,

2513
01:51:53,350 --> 01:51:55,600
he's a rebel bro.
His horse just wanders around.

2514
01:51:55,601 --> 01:52:00,040
The navy calls it with a whistle like 
red dead.

2515
01:52:00,041 --> 01:52:00,874
I love it,
but forget the shoe tying into a 

2516
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:04,713
stretch.
But these guys that learned how to win 

2517
01:52:06,341 --> 01:52:07,250
friends by going,
oh,

2518
01:52:07,251 --> 01:52:09,210
ms dot Johnson sucks.
Right?

2519
01:52:09,211 --> 01:52:09,490
Right,
right.

2520
01:52:09,490 --> 01:52:13,900
And then they just learn like sarcasm 
can be so funny.

2521
01:52:14,050 --> 01:52:14,883
But I think so many people that just 
misappropriating sarcasm by saying 

2522
01:52:17,711 --> 01:52:18,640
whatever it is,
sex,

2523
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:20,590
if I'm eating a Burrito in the bottom 
falls out.

2524
01:52:20,591 --> 01:52:25,030
They go though it looks like a good,
like that's not funny.

2525
01:52:25,060 --> 01:52:28,170
You're just being a dick.
But in their twitter bio UC,

2526
01:52:28,171 --> 01:52:31,990
like sarcasm is just one of the many 
services I offer.

2527
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:34,360
You're just an asshole.
That's not funny.

2528
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:36,900
Chandler are better with sarcasm.
Right?

2529
01:52:37,030 --> 01:52:41,140
But they probably are trying and failing
just like we try and fail with jokes.

2530
01:52:41,370 --> 01:52:44,830
Like Lulu Lemon joke isn't that.
But you know what I'm saying?

2531
01:52:44,831 --> 01:52:47,440
I mean all try and fail.
Gearhart bad you,

2532
01:52:47,450 --> 01:52:48,283
you hate as a lack of imagination and 
you are stepping into other people's 

2533
01:52:51,501 --> 01:52:53,360
shoes.
She was probably lit.

2534
01:52:53,540 --> 01:52:56,110
She's probably trying to be funny.
She doesn't know it.

2535
01:52:56,160 --> 01:52:56,993
Tape.
We're trying to be concerted effort of 

2536
01:52:58,521 --> 01:52:59,354
someone trying to fuck things up for me 
to actually experienced hate towards 

2537
01:53:03,231 --> 01:53:03,710
them.

2538
01:53:03,710 --> 01:53:06,650
It was because of the,
you know,

2539
01:53:07,220 --> 01:53:08,060
you could get,
look,

2540
01:53:08,061 --> 01:53:10,630
I could go on stage in a bad mood.
It can happen.

2541
01:53:10,670 --> 01:53:13,850
Older women with wine.
And it was like I don't feel like you're

2542
01:53:13,851 --> 01:53:16,070
a friendly crowd.
It can happen.

2543
01:53:16,850 --> 01:53:18,590
It can happen.
And my opener,

2544
01:53:18,591 --> 01:53:21,800
who is gay,
Brian Sullivan Kinda didn't do very well

2545
01:53:21,801 --> 01:53:25,370
and it was just kinda like you guys are 
giving me the wrong vibe.

2546
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:27,530
And I thought maybe it was a teachable 
moment,

2547
01:53:27,570 --> 01:53:31,790
but sometimes it's like you didn't 
establish the moment properly,

2548
01:53:31,810 --> 01:53:32,643
you know,
sometimes like I'll look back at some 

2549
01:53:34,131 --> 01:53:35,930
lines that I used to like,
but they,

2550
01:53:36,130 --> 01:53:37,790
they just didn't do that well.
And I'm like,

2551
01:53:37,791 --> 01:53:40,380
did I just get attached to this line?
Did I stop it?

2552
01:53:40,430 --> 01:53:42,800
Did I have a development in my standup?
Yeah,

2553
01:53:42,810 --> 01:53:45,380
yeah,
because I sort of got attached to saying

2554
01:53:45,381 --> 01:53:46,214
something this way because I had been 
doing it like that for six months or 

2555
01:53:48,051 --> 01:53:48,740
whatever.

2556
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:49,820
And then you realize like,
oh,

2557
01:53:49,821 --> 01:53:51,710
that's not a good way to set it up.
I need to just,

2558
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:53,630
I'll actually tell my babies,
you know,

2559
01:53:53,631 --> 01:53:56,420
that expression I've heard kill your 
darlings that kill you.

2560
01:53:56,750 --> 01:54:00,440
Kill your babies in terms of creatively,
creatively,

2561
01:54:00,441 --> 01:54:01,274
you have to kill some of the ideas,
but you're attached to them because 

2562
01:54:03,681 --> 01:54:04,970
they're yours.
You painful.

2563
01:54:05,010 --> 01:54:06,720
Yeah.
That's a lot of what writing is for.

2564
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:07,760
Yes.
I'll go.

2565
01:54:07,761 --> 01:54:11,200
One word is shit on my own experience.
Uh,

2566
01:54:11,450 --> 01:54:15,230
when you craft an act for fans and I 
know you know this feeling,

2567
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:17,600
then you go to a club where you know,
Irvine,

2568
01:54:17,601 --> 01:54:19,880
I don't think the crowd was necessarily 
there to see me.

2569
01:54:20,130 --> 01:54:21,110
Remember,
you're like,

2570
01:54:21,140 --> 01:54:22,670
oh shit.
Yes.

2571
01:54:22,671 --> 01:54:25,160
Stand up is more like boxing.
Then I remember.

2572
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:26,330
Oh yeah,
because if you like,

2573
01:54:26,331 --> 01:54:28,700
if you watch my special,
it's all fans.

2574
01:54:28,790 --> 01:54:30,390
You get a standing ovation when you're 
coming out.

2575
01:54:30,710 --> 01:54:31,543
And I love that.
I'm going to quote Sinbad said that he 

2576
01:54:34,561 --> 01:54:35,190
goes,
I love,

2577
01:54:35,190 --> 01:54:36,020
I love this quote.
He goes,

2578
01:54:36,020 --> 01:54:37,610
certainly is a very nice guy.
He was great.

2579
01:54:37,611 --> 01:54:39,650
He did my podcast.
Tony Hinchcliffe says he's awesome.

2580
01:54:39,860 --> 01:54:42,170
Talk about leaving your body.
Astral projection.

2581
01:54:42,260 --> 01:54:43,760
Same bad.
Does it?

2582
01:54:44,390 --> 01:54:46,590
He asked truly projects,
astral project,

2583
01:54:46,610 --> 01:54:48,050
how's he do that?
He stopped doing well.

2584
01:54:48,051 --> 01:54:50,450
There's all these techniques,
there's books and stuff about it.

2585
01:54:50,630 --> 01:54:55,400
The long and the short is you get into a
trance and you imagine a rope above you.

2586
01:54:55,410 --> 01:54:58,940
Then pull yourself down or what he did 
actually remember,

2587
01:54:59,240 --> 01:55:01,520
he was like,
I put something just out of my reach.

2588
01:55:01,850 --> 01:55:02,683
And then you're trying,
as you're laying there with your eyes 

2589
01:55:04,941 --> 01:55:05,840
closed,
meditating,

2590
01:55:05,841 --> 01:55:06,674
you're trying to reach the thing.
And then he said he felt his hand 

2591
01:55:09,260 --> 01:55:10,093
wrapped around it and that's how he knew
he had left his body and he did it for 

2592
01:55:12,681 --> 01:55:13,670
months and months and months and months.

2593
01:55:13,670 --> 01:55:16,580
And then one day he said he was like in 
this weird place he was in the cave.

2594
01:55:16,740 --> 01:55:20,180
Something like shadow creature came up 
and hit him in the chest.

2595
01:55:20,510 --> 01:55:22,940
I know this is sinbad,
remember Eddie goes.

2596
01:55:22,970 --> 01:55:26,360
And it felt like someone had cracked me 
in the chest with a sledge hammer and he

2597
01:55:26,361 --> 01:55:27,320
was like,
I never did it again.

2598
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:28,550
Whoa.
And I was like,

2599
01:55:28,551 --> 01:55:29,690
really?
You got to go back?

2600
01:55:29,870 --> 01:55:31,580
Try and find like booby island or 
something.

2601
01:55:31,950 --> 01:55:32,783
He's right though.
Maybe he's ready to be snatched up by 

2602
01:55:34,371 --> 01:55:37,850
the demons and stranger things.
It is next dimension demon that lives in

2603
01:55:37,851 --> 01:55:39,110
the wall.
It is scary.

2604
01:55:39,380 --> 01:55:42,050
If you read a journey's out of the body 
are far.

2605
01:55:42,051 --> 01:55:44,070
Journey is a Robert Monroe in

2606
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:44,903
the fifties.
It's like you read this book and he 

2607
01:55:46,381 --> 01:55:47,214
still calls black people negros and 
stuff like you can tell it's an old old 

2608
01:55:49,651 --> 01:55:50,484
book,
but he's telling that's how old this 

2609
01:55:51,691 --> 01:55:52,950
stuff is.
It's goes way back.

2610
01:55:53,220 --> 01:55:54,053
He would tell stories about like seeing 
something fly by and being very 

2611
01:55:56,701 --> 01:55:59,880
concerned that that thing was trying to 
get into his body before you needed.

2612
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:02,790
So it's kind of a scary thing.
But anyway,

2613
01:56:03,150 --> 01:56:05,790
but don't you think that dreams and you 
know,

2614
01:56:05,791 --> 01:56:09,840
moods like states of mind,
like the state of mind that you had when

2615
01:56:09,841 --> 01:56:13,050
you went on stage that time,
the state of mind that you have when you

2616
01:56:13,051 --> 01:56:16,650
have a fucked up dream,
it's like the ability to do that,

2617
01:56:16,651 --> 01:56:17,484
your mind has to change stances and 
positions and that these stances and 

2618
01:56:21,301 --> 01:56:24,840
positions really greatly affect how you 
react to a situation.

2619
01:56:25,110 --> 01:56:29,440
So you're coming into something with so 
much baggage and so much good or bad.

2620
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:32,430
Like sometimes you come into something 
and you'd be in the best mood ever.

2621
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:36,780
And like I got rear ended by this 
undocumented worker and uh,

2622
01:56:36,810 --> 01:56:39,330
he's a,
a guy was illegal in the country.

2623
01:56:39,331 --> 01:56:42,330
He was from Mexico,
he didn't have insurance and I had,

2624
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:46,620
it was my favorite car.
I have a porsche nine slash 11,

2625
01:56:46,621 --> 01:56:50,610
gt three.
It's a race car to car to drive.

2626
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:52,470
I've had it for years.
I love it.

2627
01:56:52,740 --> 01:56:53,573
It's just like really light car that 
sound in this guy fucking plowed into 

2628
01:56:57,301 --> 01:56:58,740
them and the engine's in the back.
Yeah.

2629
01:56:58,741 --> 01:57:00,420
And I was like,
oh no,

2630
01:57:00,421 --> 01:57:01,254
I was thinking my car's fucked.
But luckily he don't like when he hit 

2631
01:57:05,281 --> 01:57:08,060
the brakes he was texting of course.
And when he,

2632
01:57:08,061 --> 01:57:10,680
uh,
and traffic was stopped and he looked up

2633
01:57:10,681 --> 01:57:11,514
and I saw him look up.
I saw him in the rear view mirror and I 

2634
01:57:13,111 --> 01:57:13,920
saw his face.

2635
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:15,450
I saw him slam on the brakes.
I'm like,

2636
01:57:15,451 --> 01:57:16,284
this guy's going to hit me for sure.
And he had a Honda civic and his car 

2637
01:57:20,041 --> 01:57:21,810
went under my car because,
you know,

2638
01:57:21,890 --> 01:57:22,950
when you break dive,
you know,

2639
01:57:22,951 --> 01:57:24,640
your car dips down.
Wow.

2640
01:57:24,900 --> 01:57:29,160
So his car literally like,
ran into my car but kind of lifted it up

2641
01:57:29,161 --> 01:57:30,860
and sent me a flying.
Yes,

2642
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:33,790
he sent me fine and crushed his car.
Um,

2643
01:57:33,990 --> 01:57:37,620
but it was luckily that he had a light 
car and it damaged my car,

2644
01:57:37,621 --> 01:57:39,030
but they will,
they fixed it pretty quickly,

2645
01:57:39,750 --> 01:57:44,750
but at that moment I got out of the car 
and I was in the best state of mind that

2646
01:57:45,060 --> 01:57:45,893
day.
I had been doing a lot of yoga and it 

2647
01:57:47,461 --> 01:57:48,750
just,
everything was going good.

2648
01:57:48,751 --> 01:57:51,670
I was feeling positive and generous and 
friendly and I,

2649
01:57:51,671 --> 01:57:53,700
I talked to him and I was like,
I go,

2650
01:57:53,701 --> 01:57:54,570
do you have a license?

2651
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:55,433
He's like,
no,

2652
01:57:55,530 --> 01:57:56,160
I go,
boy,

2653
01:57:56,160 --> 01:57:57,270
driving,
you don't have a license.

2654
01:57:57,271 --> 01:57:58,440
And he was honest.
He goes,

2655
01:57:58,441 --> 01:57:59,274
I gotta work,
man.

2656
01:57:59,730 --> 01:58:03,090
I grew up and uh,
I called,

2657
01:58:03,091 --> 01:58:03,924
uh,
I don't remember what I called a tow 

2658
01:58:06,121 --> 01:58:06,954
truck or if I called the police.
I don't remember what I did because we 

2659
01:58:09,001 --> 01:58:10,110
pulled out,
his car was fucked.

2660
01:58:10,530 --> 01:58:11,363
My car drove to the comedy store.
I drove that night but I was going to 

2661
01:58:14,610 --> 01:58:15,443
get his information and everything and I
was going to stick around for the cops 

2662
01:58:18,121 --> 01:58:20,220
and tell the cops that,
you know,

2663
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:22,470
this guy doesn't have a license and this
and that.

2664
01:58:22,471 --> 01:58:24,300
And I'm like,
fuck this.

2665
01:58:24,510 --> 01:58:25,440
I'm like,
alright man,

2666
01:58:25,470 --> 01:58:27,060
have a good night.
I just drove away.

2667
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:28,313
I just drove away.
I got so nervous that you were about to 

2668
01:58:30,301 --> 01:58:32,250
tell me a story where you're like,
and then the cops came.

2669
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:35,420
So I signed autographs while they 
arrested this guy.

2670
01:58:35,610 --> 01:58:38,190
I bolted.
I didn't want to tell on him.

2671
01:58:38,191 --> 01:58:39,070
I'm like,
she's like,

2672
01:58:39,140 --> 01:58:41,650
it's 25 year old kid from Mexico is 
trying to make it,

2673
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:42,513
trying to,
you know,

2674
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:43,513
try and make some money.
You trying to do better demonstrated 

2675
01:58:45,341 --> 01:58:46,240
grace.
Well,

2676
01:58:46,241 --> 01:58:47,074
I also,
I was in a good state of mind like I 

2677
01:58:48,401 --> 01:58:49,780
could've been in a terrible state of 
mind.

2678
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:53,020
I could have been ramped up,
I could have gotten in some altercation,

2679
01:58:53,021 --> 01:58:56,710
some dickhead at yet because of this 
will fuck that guy and this guy hit me,

2680
01:58:56,711 --> 01:58:57,460
man,
what the fuck,

2681
01:58:57,460 --> 01:58:58,181
you know,
you,

2682
01:58:58,181 --> 01:59:00,540
you come into it already ramped up.
That's right.

2683
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:05,560
But that moment made me realize like you
can go into a moment,

2684
01:59:05,830 --> 01:59:06,663
like if you could be at a,
in the best state of mind you can do 

2685
01:59:11,170 --> 01:59:12,790
regardless of the circumstance.
That's right.

2686
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:13,691
Well,
you know,

2687
01:59:13,691 --> 01:59:15,510
it's funny that you said that because I 
had that kind of are.

2688
01:59:15,570 --> 01:59:16,403
This is actually just had an argument 
with my mother and then we went to 

2689
01:59:18,551 --> 01:59:20,860
dinner and I was in the best mood before
that I was,

2690
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:21,713
I meditated and I just felt amazing and 
then I called my mom because I was 

2691
01:59:24,371 --> 01:59:25,091
feeling good.
I was like,

2692
01:59:25,091 --> 01:59:26,410
I can,
I can handle a call home,

2693
01:59:26,600 --> 01:59:28,600
got in a bad mood.
Immediately.

2694
01:59:28,900 --> 01:59:29,733
Val and I were going to dinner and then 
we're at dinner and I'm just kind of 

2695
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:34,600
complaining about it and then she's 
like,

2696
01:59:34,910 --> 01:59:35,743
what if,
what if we changed your frequency a 

2697
01:59:37,931 --> 01:59:38,680
little bit?
She,

2698
01:59:38,680 --> 01:59:40,480
I don't even know if she used that word,
but she was like,

2699
01:59:40,481 --> 01:59:43,210
what are we grateful for?
And that's Kinda like where you were.

2700
01:59:43,211 --> 01:59:46,360
You had just been doing yoga and stuff.
We just started making a list.

2701
01:59:46,361 --> 01:59:49,030
It wasn't like it wasn't huge big 
things.

2702
01:59:49,031 --> 01:59:50,560
It was just like,
I'm grateful that we have.

2703
01:59:50,860 --> 01:59:53,590
We have a car before we can come to this
restaurant,

2704
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:56,530
that we have the money right now to eat 
this meal.

2705
01:59:56,860 --> 01:59:57,693
I'm grateful for this body.
I'm grateful for the help and you were 

2706
02:00:00,461 --> 02:00:02,410
talking about earlier,
gratitude,

2707
02:00:02,411 --> 02:00:03,244
man.
That's how to get yourself into that 

2708
02:00:04,541 --> 02:00:09,541
place so important and to exercise 
gratitude consciously all the time,

2709
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,850
just to be happy and thankful and 
generosity.

2710
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:14,590
Generosity is another thing that's 
really.

2711
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:17,020
That'll change your frequency for sure.
I think those,

2712
02:00:17,080 --> 02:00:17,913
those things,
and gratitude also shifts your 

2713
02:00:20,651 --> 02:00:22,830
perspective and gets you to understand 
that,

2714
02:00:22,870 --> 02:00:25,120
boy,
I could be in Africa right now living in

2715
02:00:25,121 --> 02:00:26,850
the Congo and malaria.
You know,

2716
02:00:26,851 --> 02:00:29,740
I could be fucked.
I could be in some worn torn part of the

2717
02:00:29,741 --> 02:00:31,300
world where I'm trying to escape.
That's right.

2718
02:00:31,330 --> 02:00:32,163
You know this.
I think that's also one of the things 

2719
02:00:33,191 --> 02:00:36,700
that people find so disturbing about 
this trump ban on immigrants.

2720
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:37,753
You know,
now they're telling you they're not 

2721
02:00:38,231 --> 02:00:39,064
calling it a band anymore,
but seth meyers is the hilarious thing 

2722
02:00:41,350 --> 02:00:42,183
where they were saying that it's not a 
band that he showed all these clips of 

2723
02:00:45,490 --> 02:00:48,970
pence and trump and all these different 
people calling it a band,

2724
02:00:48,971 --> 02:00:50,050
a band,
the band,

2725
02:00:50,051 --> 02:00:51,100
the band,
the band,

2726
02:00:51,101 --> 02:00:52,780
the band,
and um,

2727
02:00:53,140 --> 02:00:53,973
it,
it hurts people when you know that this 

2728
02:00:55,541 --> 02:00:56,374
is a country that was founded on 
immigrants and this is a country that 

2729
02:01:00,360 --> 02:01:01,193
everyone in this country was originally 
an immigrant that was our native 

2730
02:01:05,711 --> 02:01:07,210
Americans.
Native Americans,

2731
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:08,313
by the way,
we're fucking immigrants too because 

2732
02:01:10,510 --> 02:01:11,440
10,000
years ago,

2733
02:01:11,441 --> 02:01:13,810
this entire country was covered by two 
miles of ice.

2734
02:01:14,090 --> 02:01:14,771
Okay?
I mean,

2735
02:01:14,771 --> 02:01:15,400
this,
this,

2736
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:16,233
everyone came here from somewhere else.
I mean is in terms of recent humans we 

2737
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:23,710
recent being the last 20,000
years,

2738
02:01:23,711 --> 02:01:24,544
everyone came from somewhere else.
When they do these genetic examinations 

2739
02:01:27,521 --> 02:01:29,220
of native Americans,
one of the things they find is they,

2740
02:01:29,230 --> 02:01:30,063
they,
they share common ancestors in Siberia 

2741
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:36,850
means they came across the bering strait
when it was connected.

2742
02:01:36,850 --> 02:01:40,310
And this is just,
this is the price where people come.

2743
02:01:40,370 --> 02:01:41,480
That's our idea.
Yeah,

2744
02:01:41,510 --> 02:01:42,343
so when you're blocking these people 
that are in one of the worst places in 

2745
02:01:45,111 --> 02:01:46,170
the world,
Syria,

2746
02:01:46,430 --> 02:01:48,890
you know,
and then there was like this list of all

2747
02:01:48,891 --> 02:01:49,724
these Muslim countries where people are 
allowed to come into America problems 

2748
02:01:52,840 --> 02:01:53,673
and there's so many fucking people and 
so many different countries that are 

2749
02:01:56,571 --> 02:01:57,404
Muslim.
I mean it's whether it's Pakistan or 

2750
02:01:59,090 --> 02:01:59,923
Indonesia,
but then there's politics involved in 

2751
02:02:01,281 --> 02:02:02,114
that.
I think somebody pointed out that a lot 

2752
02:02:03,111 --> 02:02:03,944
of like Saudi Arabia or wherever,
these are places where there are trump 

2753
02:02:05,781 --> 02:02:06,760
hotels.
I don't know.

2754
02:02:06,780 --> 02:02:07,613
I don't know if that's true either,
but the real issue is Syria is the hot 

2755
02:02:10,641 --> 02:02:13,880
topic and I don't necessarily think this
guy has the time,

2756
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:17,450
nor does he have the inclination to 
deeply look into things with a,

2757
02:02:17,550 --> 02:02:21,230
a greater perspective than what he 
currently has.

2758
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:23,240
Right.
You would think that,

2759
02:02:23,241 --> 02:02:24,074
you know,
Howard stern had a very interesting 

2760
02:02:24,681 --> 02:02:28,340
thing that he said about Donald Trump 
and I would defer to him because I think

2761
02:02:28,341 --> 02:02:29,174
he knows Donald Trump personally and he 
said that he doesn't think that this is 

2762
02:02:32,241 --> 02:02:34,640
good for Donald.
Like his mental health,

2763
02:02:34,670 --> 02:02:35,503
which I thought it was interesting 
because Howard was coming at it like as 

2764
02:02:36,891 --> 02:02:40,700
a friend and he said essentially the 
donald wants to be loved,

2765
02:02:41,060 --> 02:02:41,893
and he said that that's what he wants.
All these people that love him and he's 

2766
02:02:43,911 --> 02:02:44,744
like,
I don't think this is a good job for 

2767
02:02:46,041 --> 02:02:47,390
him.
For his mind.

2768
02:02:47,420 --> 02:02:51,740
I know it's fucking crazy.
That is crazy.

2769
02:02:51,741 --> 02:02:53,660
I remember when Chappelle hosted snl and
he was like,

2770
02:02:53,661 --> 02:02:56,300
I'm going to give him a shot.
That's what we were putting ourselves.

2771
02:02:56,301 --> 02:02:57,134
Right.
Those of us that weren't on board with 

2772
02:02:58,611 --> 02:02:59,191
him,
we were there.

2773
02:02:59,191 --> 02:03:02,450
We only have this one thing that's right
now the disturbing thing,

2774
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:03,050
right?

2775
02:03:03,050 --> 02:03:03,883
There's not really a lot of other stuff.
There's this one that the ban on 

2776
02:03:06,261 --> 02:03:07,094
immigrants is really.
It's an issue because there's families 

2777
02:03:09,381 --> 02:03:10,214
that are coming over here and they have 
children and you see them and they're 

2778
02:03:11,931 --> 02:03:13,970
sad and desperate.
It's scary.

2779
02:03:14,290 --> 02:03:15,810
You know you're leaving your home,
your,

2780
02:03:15,811 --> 02:03:18,770
your seeking refuge in America.
You have a travel visa and you can't get

2781
02:03:18,771 --> 02:03:19,604
in.
That scares the fuck out of people 

2782
02:03:21,291 --> 02:03:24,350
because you think that could be me.
That could be my mom,

2783
02:03:24,351 --> 02:03:25,870
that could be my sister.
Right?

2784
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:26,713
That was my mom.
My mom fled world war two from 

2785
02:03:28,671 --> 02:03:30,020
Lithuania.
There you go.

2786
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:31,070
So I mean,
come on.

2787
02:03:31,100 --> 02:03:33,050
That's insane.
That is fucking insane.

2788
02:03:33,051 --> 02:03:37,070
I mean it scares the shit out of us when
we think that we could be.

2789
02:03:37,080 --> 02:03:40,580
So Zena phobic that we could just put 
this like this blanket statement,

2790
02:03:40,581 --> 02:03:42,470
but let's wait.
You said earlier it becomes them,

2791
02:03:43,700 --> 02:03:46,430
but on the other side you don't want 
what's happening in Germany.

2792
02:03:46,640 --> 02:03:48,380
You don't want what's happening in 
France.

2793
02:03:48,381 --> 02:03:49,214
You don't want.
We have these people that aren't 

2794
02:03:50,601 --> 02:03:51,434
integrating with the culture and they're
creating these significant problems and 

2795
02:03:53,841 --> 02:03:57,830
you have like what Merkel is dealing 
with right now in Germany,

2796
02:03:57,831 --> 02:04:01,790
this culture clash and you're having a 
lot of problems between people and these

2797
02:04:01,791 --> 02:04:05,960
radical Muslim elements and they're,
they're isolating and creating their own

2798
02:04:05,961 --> 02:04:09,980
neighborhoods and you know,
and people don't want to integrate.

2799
02:04:09,981 --> 02:04:10,814
They want to bring a piece of their 
country here and they have extremely 

2800
02:04:13,941 --> 02:04:18,500
different values mean whether you want 
to be critical of these people that live

2801
02:04:18,501 --> 02:04:21,770
in the Middle East or not the reality.
And we all know this,

2802
02:04:21,890 --> 02:04:22,723
when you look at the rights that women 
in Saudi Arabia or are denied the right 

2803
02:04:27,051 --> 02:04:29,600
to drive,
they have to wear certain clothing.

2804
02:04:29,780 --> 02:04:32,720
They have to have to look away when men 
are looking at them.

2805
02:04:32,900 --> 02:04:33,733
I mean there's a lot of shit that these 
women have to deal with that is a 

2806
02:04:37,410 --> 02:04:41,430
cultural standard in their part of the 
world that doesn't fly.

2807
02:04:41,460 --> 02:04:42,293
And if they bring that over to Germany,
then you see these men that are from 

2808
02:04:45,631 --> 02:04:48,030
that part of the world that are in their
thirties or whatever.

2809
02:04:48,031 --> 02:04:48,864
There are grown adults know whatever the
age and that is their standard of 

2810
02:04:52,981 --> 02:04:55,590
behavior and now they're seeing white 
women in Germany,

2811
02:04:55,591 --> 02:04:56,424
these German women that are not behaving
then not acting in that standard and 

2812
02:04:59,641 --> 02:05:02,520
they feel like these women are harlots.
They feel like these women are sluts and

2813
02:05:02,521 --> 02:05:03,810
they can just do whatever they want with
them.

2814
02:05:04,140 --> 02:05:07,290
And you're finding.
I mean there's not how many of them,

2815
02:05:07,350 --> 02:05:09,030
how many incidents are there?
I don't know,

2816
02:05:09,031 --> 02:05:11,340
but there's enough where it's a 
significant issue.

2817
02:05:11,370 --> 02:05:13,770
There's enough that this is something 
that needs to be discussed.

2818
02:05:13,780 --> 02:05:17,490
Like you have these,
this new element that you brought in and

2819
02:05:17,491 --> 02:05:19,650
how do you mitigate that without being 
racist,

2820
02:05:19,651 --> 02:05:20,660
without being seen in public?

2821
02:05:20,700 --> 02:05:22,170
How do you,
how do you,

2822
02:05:22,470 --> 02:05:26,700
how do you somehow or another encourage 
these people to evolve their culture?

2823
02:05:27,850 --> 02:05:30,240
Because that's a real issue.
It is very interesting.

2824
02:05:30,241 --> 02:05:31,074
It,
it did make me think of the word both 

2825
02:05:32,281 --> 02:05:34,260
from Boston and the Irish,
you know,

2826
02:05:34,261 --> 02:05:37,130
segregated kept to themselves and they 
were Irish neighborhoods.

2827
02:05:37,860 --> 02:05:42,510
It gets tricky when something is so 
culturally different for us.

2828
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:45,840
They do have a right to have their 
neighborhood be however,

2829
02:05:45,841 --> 02:05:48,900
they weren't sure,
but for some reason it could be racism.

2830
02:05:48,901 --> 02:05:51,780
It could be just a.
it's not normal to us.

2831
02:05:51,990 --> 02:05:52,823
The way that they behave with women or 
the way that they want women to behave 

2832
02:05:55,650 --> 02:05:57,120
that well,
that's not racism.

2833
02:05:57,150 --> 02:05:59,100
That's a,
it's a huge issue.

2834
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:00,233
I understand.
I don't want women to be sublimated and 

2835
02:06:02,670 --> 02:06:03,503
what's interesting is that you would 
think that that would be totally in 

2836
02:06:07,801 --> 02:06:08,634
opposition of liberal values,
but the liberals are the ones that are 

2837
02:06:13,341 --> 02:06:17,640
like really concerned with these people,
with people not being Islamophobic,

2838
02:06:17,790 --> 02:06:18,623
which is also a good thing to think,
but there has to be some rational and 

2839
02:06:22,681 --> 02:06:23,514
reasonable consideration for the 
cultural differences that are vast and 

2840
02:06:26,611 --> 02:06:31,611
real and scary and also they're 
incredibly restrictive on women.

2841
02:06:31,950 --> 02:06:34,320
Incredibly restrictive and on 
homosexuals.

2842
02:06:34,620 --> 02:06:35,453
I mean what you're seeing with isis 
thrown gay people off rooftops and in 

2843
02:06:39,001 --> 02:06:39,834
Iraq and some horrible,
horrible shit that is the standard in 

2844
02:06:43,591 --> 02:06:44,424
that part of the world and when you're 
dealing with a culture that is just 

2845
02:06:49,441 --> 02:06:50,274
perot programmed,
programmed for so long to be oppressive 

2846
02:06:53,041 --> 02:06:55,050
towards homosexuals,
to be oppressive towards women,

2847
02:06:55,380 --> 02:06:57,300
like violently oppressive.
You know,

2848
02:06:57,301 --> 02:06:59,130
where they think you're allowed to beat 
women.

2849
02:06:59,131 --> 02:06:59,964
I watched one of the most horrible 
videos and I should have never watched 

2850
02:07:02,251 --> 02:07:03,084
it,
but it was a a man and his daughter and 

2851
02:07:07,111 --> 02:07:07,944
the daughter had been accused of 
adultery and so he was going to be the 

2852
02:07:12,040 --> 02:07:12,873
guy there was stoning his daughter to 
death and he was the first guy to throw 

2853
02:07:15,781 --> 02:07:16,614
the stone and his daughter was begging 
for mercy and reaching out to touch his 

2854
02:07:20,221 --> 02:07:21,054
hand and he wouldn't touch her hand and 
he hit her with the Rock and then they 

2855
02:07:23,221 --> 02:07:24,750
all through the rock center and I was 
like,

2856
02:07:24,751 --> 02:07:28,050
fuck,
this is just a religion.

2857
02:07:28,110 --> 02:07:28,943
Just an ideology that forces people into
this and if you take these people that 

2858
02:07:32,311 --> 02:07:33,144
are so deep in that ideology and so deep
that brainwashing and then you bring 

2859
02:07:36,521 --> 02:07:37,354
them over to a free country to a 
democratic country that has an open 

2860
02:07:41,621 --> 02:07:44,740
policy on religion and freedom of 
expression.

2861
02:07:44,770 --> 02:07:46,370
Do whatever you want.
You're gonna.

2862
02:07:46,390 --> 02:07:48,100
Have A.
You're gonna have a problem.

2863
02:07:48,220 --> 02:07:49,053
There's going to be some sort of a gap 
that needs to be crossed and I don't 

2864
02:07:53,231 --> 02:07:54,670
know how to do it.
How do you.

2865
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:57,130
How do you make those people evolve?
Their ideas?

2866
02:07:57,131 --> 02:07:58,150
I just don't know.

2867
02:08:00,370 --> 02:08:01,630
Scary.
I don't even.

2868
02:08:01,780 --> 02:08:02,613
It's crazy.
So when you think about people coming 

2869
02:08:04,121 --> 02:08:08,260
into this country hand,
we were new at this and there's gonna be

2870
02:08:09,070 --> 02:08:12,550
mistakes and there's going to be things 
like that seem unsolvable problems.

2871
02:08:12,790 --> 02:08:13,623
There is the human life element of it.
We know that there's a basis of like 

2872
02:08:16,780 --> 02:08:19,060
people are dying and they need help.
Yes,

2873
02:08:19,150 --> 02:08:19,811
and then we go,
well,

2874
02:08:19,811 --> 02:08:22,570
people that we may not agree with her 
dying and need help,

2875
02:08:22,660 --> 02:08:25,690
but you still go,
we don't need to take lsd to go,

2876
02:08:25,990 --> 02:08:26,823
well,
you still need to help people that you 

2877
02:08:27,461 --> 02:08:28,630
don't agree with.
You're right,

2878
02:08:28,750 --> 02:08:29,583
it's,
that's not the issue and the vast 

2879
02:08:31,271 --> 02:08:32,980
majority,
let's be really clear,

2880
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:37,420
are never going to cause any problems.
The vast majority are going to integrate

2881
02:08:37,421 --> 02:08:38,254
fine.
They're going to have friends that are 

2882
02:08:38,891 --> 02:08:41,890
Christians and baptists,
Mormons and whatever,

2883
02:08:41,891 --> 02:08:43,020
and then there's going to be no issues.

2884
02:08:43,060 --> 02:08:45,580
The vast majority,
but there is going to be.

2885
02:08:45,610 --> 02:08:48,910
There's going to be a few issues and 
when those issues pop up,

2886
02:08:49,180 --> 02:08:51,160
then it always becomes highlighted.
Oh,

2887
02:08:51,161 --> 02:08:53,080
it's their religion.
It's their ideology,

2888
02:08:53,260 --> 02:08:55,000
you know,
it could be mental health issues.

2889
02:08:55,870 --> 02:08:59,070
They just overturn something here in 
America though that it was like,

2890
02:08:59,080 --> 02:09:01,360
it's no longer a federal or I don't 
know.

2891
02:09:01,420 --> 02:09:02,253
I don't know the legal speak,
but it's no longer as serious of an 

2892
02:09:04,331 --> 02:09:06,130
offense as it used to be to beat your 
wife.

2893
02:09:06,500 --> 02:09:09,520
So no,
that was actually in Egypt.

2894
02:09:09,790 --> 02:09:11,350
No,
where was it was just.

2895
02:09:11,650 --> 02:09:13,700
It was just a law that was just.
Hold on a second.

2896
02:09:13,701 --> 02:09:16,930
There was just a law that was just past.
Where the fuck was that?

2897
02:09:19,190 --> 02:09:21,550
God Damn it.
I tweeted about it.

2898
02:09:21,580 --> 02:09:22,900
Oh,
Russia was in Russia.

2899
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:24,130
Russia.
Russia.

2900
02:09:24,550 --> 02:09:25,383
Yeah.
Crazy.

2901
02:09:25,420 --> 02:09:26,253
Like domestic violence is decriminalized
in Russia if it doesn't cause severe 

2902
02:09:29,381 --> 02:09:30,460
injury.
We also,

2903
02:09:30,461 --> 02:09:35,461
what I'm saying is we also have people 
here that are very backwards about women

2904
02:09:36,071 --> 02:09:36,904
and gays,
that we have plenty of them and they're 

2905
02:09:39,551 --> 02:09:40,384
also here.
I'm just trying to advocate the Saudis 

2906
02:09:44,110 --> 02:09:44,943
and a lot of the Middle Eastern 
countries take that shit to a whole new 

2907
02:09:47,081 --> 02:09:49,390
level.
I human aren't even allowed to drive.

2908
02:09:49,410 --> 02:09:50,243
Right.
I mean they have to have a male 

2909
02:09:51,101 --> 02:09:53,440
companion when they go out at night.
I mean,

2910
02:09:53,441 --> 02:09:54,274
there's,
there's some unbelievably regressive 

2911
02:09:56,111 --> 02:10:00,280
ideas that are just accepted because we 
don't want to appear to be homophobic or

2912
02:10:00,281 --> 02:10:01,450
excuse me,
Islamophobia.

2913
02:10:01,451 --> 02:10:02,240
And then there's Bob,
uh,

2914
02:10:02,240 --> 02:10:03,820
I think,
is it Bob Jones?

2915
02:10:03,910 --> 02:10:07,540
There's a Christian university where 
there's blue sidewalls for boys and pink

2916
02:10:07,541 --> 02:10:08,350
for girls.

2917
02:10:08,350 --> 02:10:10,480
So everybody's fucked what I'm saying.
Right.

2918
02:10:10,481 --> 02:10:13,640
But they're not stoning people.
They're not having a fighter.

2919
02:10:14,340 --> 02:10:15,940
Just,
I mean,

2920
02:10:15,941 --> 02:10:17,600
you just scarred me emotionally.
Honor,

2921
02:10:17,620 --> 02:10:20,350
killing.
Honor killing is a real thing.

2922
02:10:20,370 --> 02:10:22,350
Yeah.
I mean this is not,

2923
02:10:22,450 --> 02:10:25,780
this is not like an imaginary idea 
that's never enforced.

2924
02:10:25,781 --> 02:10:29,260
It's a real thing.
So it's female genital mutilation.

2925
02:10:29,580 --> 02:10:34,580
He talked to Ian Hirsi Ali about it and 
she gets labeled in Islamophobia because

2926
02:10:35,031 --> 02:10:35,864
she talks openly about the problems with
the ideology and she's a woman who 

2927
02:10:39,951 --> 02:10:42,470
experienced female genital mutilation.
I mean she was,

2928
02:10:42,750 --> 02:10:43,583
that she had to flee her country and now
she's here writing books and giving 

2929
02:10:46,611 --> 02:10:49,340
lectures.
And the hardcore left the far left.

2930
02:10:49,341 --> 02:10:52,430
Crazies are attacking her as being 
Islamophobic.

2931
02:10:52,430 --> 02:10:52,530
But

2932
02:10:52,530 --> 02:10:54,760
you know what's interesting about these 
very,

2933
02:10:54,761 --> 02:10:55,594
very complicated,
and you've just illuminated me in many 

2934
02:10:58,031 --> 02:11:01,360
ways,
a issues is when things get really,

2935
02:11:01,361 --> 02:11:02,194
really complicated,
we do take comfort in what I call like 

2936
02:11:05,350 --> 02:11:07,380
the slingblade mentality.
Remember slingblade?

2937
02:11:07,381 --> 02:11:09,030
Yeah.
So there's dad.

2938
02:11:10,140 --> 02:11:12,010
Alright.
Some people call it a kaiser blade.

2939
02:11:12,011 --> 02:11:17,011
I call it a sling blade.
So that movie is like strangely pleasant

2940
02:11:17,890 --> 02:11:18,723
in this weird way because the boy has 
the abusive father and the mother and 

2941
02:11:22,751 --> 02:11:25,540
they're being held captive by this drunk
asshole.

2942
02:11:25,750 --> 02:11:27,430
Spoiler alert.
It's from the nineties.

2943
02:11:27,431 --> 02:11:29,020
You should have seen that by now,
right?

2944
02:11:29,370 --> 02:11:30,203
Incomes.
A simple man who is a graceful 

2945
02:11:32,681 --> 02:11:34,420
character,
a compassionate character,

2946
02:11:34,630 --> 02:11:35,463
and he kills the dad.
He hits him in the head with a sling 

2947
02:11:37,691 --> 02:11:38,524
blade.
That's why the movie's called Sling 

2948
02:11:39,610 --> 02:11:42,580
Blade and he kills the guy.
So it is this complicated thing.

2949
02:11:42,790 --> 02:11:44,980
The drunk dad is a person.

2950
02:11:44,980 --> 02:11:47,260
We could zoom out on him and be like,
okay,

2951
02:11:47,261 --> 02:11:48,820
why is he drinking?
What's going on?

2952
02:11:48,821 --> 02:11:51,190
How can we help them?
How can we rehabilitate this guy?

2953
02:11:51,430 --> 02:11:55,840
But there's something about being a 
human that occasionally John Wick style,

2954
02:11:56,020 --> 02:11:58,900
you just want a guy to go in and shoot a
bunch of a bunch of people.

2955
02:11:58,930 --> 02:12:00,940
Just clean the problem up in a simple 
way.

2956
02:12:00,941 --> 02:12:02,440
What I'm saying?
Punch Nazis.

2957
02:12:02,470 --> 02:12:04,030
That's what I'm saying.
There you go.

2958
02:12:04,150 --> 02:12:09,150
So complicated issues somehow attract 
overly simple response,

2959
02:12:10,091 --> 02:12:12,000
especially because people are lazy.
That's what.

2960
02:12:12,060 --> 02:12:13,840
That's where racism comes in.
You Go.

2961
02:12:13,841 --> 02:12:16,630
I'm afraid that some people are 
dangerous.

2962
02:12:16,870 --> 02:12:17,703
Well,
these guys say black people are 

2963
02:12:18,431 --> 02:12:19,450
dangerous.
Ah,

2964
02:12:19,600 --> 02:12:20,433
I feel a little bit more comfortable 
because I look around the store and 

2965
02:12:22,721 --> 02:12:24,430
there's.
None of them would really.

2966
02:12:24,431 --> 02:12:25,264
There's a white guy that'll fuck you up 
just as bad as anybody in that same 

2967
02:12:28,271 --> 02:12:28,900
store.

2968
02:12:28,900 --> 02:12:31,750
But we're looking for these click 
moments where we just go,

2969
02:12:31,960 --> 02:12:34,000
John Wick shot the guy,
go to bed.

2970
02:12:34,300 --> 02:12:35,133
And that's what I think.
And I'm actually trying to understand 

2971
02:12:38,320 --> 02:12:41,830
trump supporters.
I think there's a slingblade thing going

2972
02:12:41,831 --> 02:12:44,080
on with trump where he's like,
look,

2973
02:12:44,081 --> 02:12:45,620
what are we going to do?
These people want to come in.

2974
02:12:45,650 --> 02:12:48,160
Nobody likes people dying.
But these people may be.

2975
02:12:48,161 --> 02:12:49,960
There's this threat of this changing the
culture,

2976
02:12:49,961 --> 02:12:52,090
changing women being bad this way,
violent this way.

2977
02:12:52,600 --> 02:12:53,830
Oh,
let's just not let them in.

2978
02:12:54,370 --> 02:12:57,370
It's like a panic answer,
you know what I mean?

2979
02:12:57,550 --> 02:12:58,383
And it appeals.
That was one of the things that I find 

2980
02:13:01,570 --> 02:13:04,030
not too many people like me,
I don't agree with trump,

2981
02:13:04,900 --> 02:13:05,733
but when I would watch the debates,
I would catch something in my brain 

2982
02:13:08,561 --> 02:13:09,580
going,
oh,

2983
02:13:09,581 --> 02:13:12,070
this guy's driving the car.
You know what I mean?

2984
02:13:12,071 --> 02:13:17,071
Like he was such a blow hard and he had 
solutions that if I was quiet enough,

2985
02:13:17,530 --> 02:13:20,590
I could recognize the part in my own 
psyche that went.

2986
02:13:20,970 --> 02:13:22,030
Data will protect us.
Yeah.

2987
02:13:22,031 --> 02:13:22,864
There's the appeal of the strong man,
a strong confident man who stands in 

2988
02:13:26,021 --> 02:13:29,170
front of all us and tells us he got it.
But if we can admit that,

2989
02:13:29,260 --> 02:13:30,970
and I'm trying to admit that as much as 
I,

2990
02:13:31,770 --> 02:13:32,040
then

2991
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:36,300
we don't see my sister getting pepper 
sprayed by my brother.

2992
02:13:36,330 --> 02:13:38,220
You know what I mean?
Like we're all in it together.

2993
02:13:38,520 --> 02:13:40,830
That's what I talk about.
Good discourse.

2994
02:13:41,070 --> 02:13:44,760
We need to go like Jon Stewart was like,
these guys aren't afraid of Muslims.

2995
02:13:44,761 --> 02:13:46,710
They're afraid of their health insurance
premiums.

2996
02:13:46,711 --> 02:13:48,720
That was such a great quote.
He was like,

2997
02:13:48,900 --> 02:13:52,380
this plan was fucking them.
They couldn't afford their insulin,

2998
02:13:52,590 --> 02:13:54,720
so trump comes in and he's like,
don't worry about it.

2999
02:13:54,900 --> 02:13:56,370
I'm going to get you jobs.
I'm going to get you this.

3000
02:13:56,371 --> 02:13:58,080
I'm going to get you that and some other
stuff.

3001
02:13:58,081 --> 02:13:59,850
Some hateful stuff is coming along with 
it,

3002
02:13:59,851 --> 02:14:02,490
but they didn't have the luxury of of 
being like,

3003
02:14:02,491 --> 02:14:04,410
well,
I got to go with Hillary.

3004
02:14:04,710 --> 02:14:06,840
They couldn't I guess.
Well,

3005
02:14:06,841 --> 02:14:07,674
simplistic speak and when you're in it's
coming from someone that holds the 

3006
02:14:11,461 --> 02:14:12,294
highest of high offices in our country 
is very dangerous because if you 

3007
02:14:15,481 --> 02:14:20,481
simplify things and say them in sort of 
a a just a kind of a block headed way.

3008
02:14:21,270 --> 02:14:24,000
Yeah.
It appeals to blockheads football game.

3009
02:14:24,001 --> 02:14:24,834
We can't go out there and when they 
don't have to think now because you're 

3010
02:14:29,221 --> 02:14:32,040
not thinking you're the leaders thinking
like a blockhead.

3011
02:14:32,070 --> 02:14:32,903
That's what I can think like a blockhead
to when Obama became president and I 

3012
02:14:35,731 --> 02:14:38,460
loved Obama,
I didn't follow too closely,

3013
02:14:38,461 --> 02:14:39,294
so I'm kind of a doofus in that way,
but I loved the man that he was and he 

3014
02:14:41,731 --> 02:14:42,564
seemed to do a good job,
but he definitely inspired a lot of 

3015
02:14:45,151 --> 02:14:46,470
young black people to be like,
oh,

3016
02:14:46,680 --> 02:14:48,680
I could.
This could happen for me.

3017
02:14:48,690 --> 02:14:51,090
I could be the president.
Look at that example,

3018
02:14:51,660 --> 02:14:53,550
and now I do think there is a risk of 
being like,

3019
02:14:53,551 --> 02:14:55,050
well,
look at this guy who calls,

3020
02:14:55,051 --> 02:14:57,960
uh,
what's her name of fat ass and a pig?

3021
02:14:57,961 --> 02:14:59,460
And he became president,
right?

3022
02:14:59,730 --> 02:15:03,300
Who are you to tell me not to bully this
kid in my class?

3023
02:15:03,300 --> 02:15:06,300
I could be the president.
I called him a homo.

3024
02:15:06,450 --> 02:15:09,450
I can be the leader of the free world.
It's dangerous.

3025
02:15:09,860 --> 02:15:10,693
That becomes dangerous when you have 
someone who's the spokesperson who 

3026
02:15:13,981 --> 02:15:15,240
speaks in like,
again,

3027
02:15:15,241 --> 02:15:16,730
these simplistic terms,
right?

3028
02:15:17,220 --> 02:15:20,640
But when you look at what Obama really 
did,

3029
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:25,560
there was a bunch of issues where he 
didn't buck the system where he did have

3030
02:15:25,561 --> 02:15:26,394
the most drone strikes.
Have any president ever where he did 

3031
02:15:28,561 --> 02:15:29,394
crack down on whistle blowers,
right where he did the opposite of what 

3032
02:15:31,681 --> 02:15:32,514
he said and his hope and change website 
where we wound up pulling that down 

3033
02:15:35,490 --> 02:15:36,323
because he had this whole segment in 
there about whistleblowers and 

3034
02:15:38,461 --> 02:15:39,294
protecting whistleblowers who are 
showing that there's some sort of 

3035
02:15:41,820 --> 02:15:42,653
illegal activity going on.
Well that's not the case at all because 

3036
02:15:45,060 --> 02:15:48,090
everything that Edward Snowden did was 
show illegal activity.

3037
02:15:48,240 --> 02:15:50,850
I mean,
he's kind of exonerated Chelsea Manning,

3038
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:51,713
you know,
so this is going to have that kind of 

3039
02:15:52,861 --> 02:15:53,694
interesting.

3040
02:15:53,730 --> 02:15:57,030
That's why I can't pick it up or lay it 
down.

3041
02:15:57,031 --> 02:15:59,640
You just have to look at it and allow 
that.

3042
02:15:59,641 --> 02:16:03,390
There's some bullshit right away because
when I see Obama,

3043
02:16:03,420 --> 02:16:06,990
some great vine of him meeting a 
basketball player and they do this whole

3044
02:16:06,991 --> 02:16:09,510
shake and play some of them and he's the
coolest guy.

3045
02:16:09,810 --> 02:16:12,960
He's articulate as he said,
and he's intelligent and he and he looks

3046
02:16:12,961 --> 02:16:14,760
cool and all that stuff.
Yeah.

3047
02:16:14,761 --> 02:16:15,594
That guy also that morning had a meeting
where they decided how many drones to 

3048
02:16:19,330 --> 02:16:20,250
roll up shit.
Well,

3049
02:16:20,251 --> 02:16:22,290
not only that,
the Dakota access pipeline,

3050
02:16:22,291 --> 02:16:26,370
all that shit went down when he was the 
president when they were making those,

3051
02:16:26,660 --> 02:16:29,290
those will.
They're cutting through private property

3052
02:16:29,291 --> 02:16:30,070
in arresting

3053
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:30,903
ranchers because these ranchers did not 
want this fucking pipe going through 

3054
02:16:34,481 --> 02:16:35,314
their water system.
That was all in his watch and he 

3055
02:16:38,050 --> 02:16:39,310
could've stopped that.
He could've.

3056
02:16:39,400 --> 02:16:40,300
He could've stepped in.

3057
02:16:40,360 --> 02:16:43,930
That's Kinda.
It gets overwhelming and then we go,

3058
02:16:43,931 --> 02:16:46,270
Geez,
everyone is corrupt.

3059
02:16:46,271 --> 02:16:47,104
Everyone's bought and paid for and 
that's where you get people not voting 

3060
02:16:49,931 --> 02:16:53,980
and that's when you get people going,
let's let's light a Molotov cocktail and

3061
02:16:53,981 --> 02:16:57,160
get somebody like trump in there.
That's what he seemed like in the voting

3062
02:16:57,161 --> 02:16:57,994
booth.
It was like status quo or brick through 

3063
02:16:59,681 --> 02:17:03,310
the window and people were.
It gets overwhelming and there's nothing

3064
02:17:03,311 --> 02:17:04,780
more simple than a brick through the 
window.

3065
02:17:04,850 --> 02:17:05,451
Well,
here's the thing,

3066
02:17:05,451 --> 02:17:07,700
another thing that you were talking 
about earlier when you were saying about

3067
02:17:07,730 --> 02:17:08,563
arrested development,
and I do agree that I think we are in a 

3068
02:17:10,581 --> 02:17:14,040
sense in as a culture and human beings,
it's.

3069
02:17:14,280 --> 02:17:15,113
There's a great propensity,
propensity to exhibit signs of arrested 

3070
02:17:17,931 --> 02:17:18,764
development.
I think one of the reasons for that is 

3071
02:17:20,421 --> 02:17:21,254
that we have to work,
I think working like doing a job that 

3072
02:17:24,351 --> 02:17:25,184
you just don't want to do,
that you have to do because you have to 

3073
02:17:26,421 --> 02:17:31,421
feed yourself is one of the most soul 
sucking and mind numbing activities that

3074
02:17:33,021 --> 02:17:33,854
a person could be trapped into doing and
when you look at how many kids in this 

3075
02:17:36,891 --> 02:17:37,724
country are graduating in great debt,
in massive debt because of student 

3076
02:17:42,141 --> 02:17:42,974
loans,
and then they get into credit card debt 

3077
02:17:44,151 --> 02:17:44,984
that sort bounce out their student loans
and you know they're deep into their 

3078
02:17:47,511 --> 02:17:49,610
thirties and they're fucked.
They're in prison,

3079
02:17:49,670 --> 02:17:50,503
they're in prison,
and they're working all day doing 

3080
02:17:51,921 --> 02:17:52,754
something they don't want to do and they
have to behave in a way that's not 

3081
02:17:54,921 --> 02:17:57,910
natural because it's the only way to 
keep this fucking stupid job.

3082
02:17:57,960 --> 02:18:01,270
They never get to express themselves in 
a really honest and true way and

3083
02:18:01,480 --> 02:18:03,130
no mistake.
It's not a hippy idea.

3084
02:18:03,131 --> 02:18:06,160
We're all here to create.
That's what the world is.

3085
02:18:06,161 --> 02:18:09,140
The world is creation and we're here to 
take our insides and bring it.

3086
02:18:09,170 --> 02:18:10,220
Well,
it's certainly.

3087
02:18:10,280 --> 02:18:11,113
I don't know if we're here for that,
but it certainly feels better to do 

3088
02:18:13,101 --> 02:18:13,934
that.
I mean if you wanted to look at the 

3089
02:18:14,421 --> 02:18:18,710
greater picture of organic life on this 
planet and like,

3090
02:18:18,711 --> 02:18:19,580
why are we here?
Well,

3091
02:18:19,581 --> 02:18:20,590
I don't.
I don't know why.

3092
02:18:20,630 --> 02:18:22,880
I don't know.
I mean I don't think anybody knows.

3093
02:18:22,881 --> 02:18:23,714
I think you could come up with all sorts
of rationalizations for why we're here 

3094
02:18:26,210 --> 02:18:28,180
and what we're doing and what our 
purpose is,

3095
02:18:28,320 --> 02:18:29,153
but is that purpose really.
I mean we have a finite existence and 

3096
02:18:31,401 --> 02:18:32,234
will give birth to other things with the
finite existences and during the time 

3097
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:36,910
they're alive,
the entire organism,

3098
02:18:36,911 --> 02:18:37,744
a super organism of human beings is 
going to innovate and constantly 

3099
02:18:40,671 --> 02:18:41,504
continue to innovate at this exponential
rate where we're going to be 

3100
02:18:43,251 --> 02:18:44,084
unrecognizable and a thousand years.
We don't even know what the fuck the 

3101
02:18:46,431 --> 02:18:48,650
human race is going to look like a 
thousand years from now.

3102
02:18:48,980 --> 02:18:51,260
So I don't know if that's what we're 
here for,

3103
02:18:51,261 --> 02:18:53,810
but I certainly know that if you want to
have a happy,

3104
02:18:53,900 --> 02:18:55,790
it feels fulfilling life.
Yeah.

3105
02:18:55,970 --> 02:18:56,803
Being a creative person or by creative,
it doesn't mean you have to be a 

3106
02:19:00,861 --> 02:19:02,250
musician,
you have to be an architect.

3107
02:19:02,330 --> 02:19:04,490
The way that your appearance that can be
creative,

3108
02:19:04,491 --> 02:19:07,460
it's just finding a way to bring 
something.

3109
02:19:07,640 --> 02:19:10,310
Could be a bay under the executive love 
making cookies.

3110
02:19:10,311 --> 02:19:12,990
You can like making tables or clocks 
like that.

3111
02:19:13,170 --> 02:19:17,530
A cool clock say to the guy probably 
feels fulfilled as fuck.

3112
02:19:17,540 --> 02:19:18,373
He could be a knife maker.
It feels really good to be a part of 

3113
02:19:21,680 --> 02:19:22,513
creation.
Does into an end or a carpenter or 

3114
02:19:24,621 --> 02:19:26,930
anything where you're doing something 
feels.

3115
02:19:27,290 --> 02:19:28,040
There's lots of

3116
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:28,873
things.
I'm very interested in the idea of 

3117
02:19:29,960 --> 02:19:32,120
giving us everything that we think we 
want.

3118
02:19:32,150 --> 02:19:34,190
We want food,
we want entertainment,

3119
02:19:34,191 --> 02:19:38,330
and then you have people staying in 
their houses that become like prisons.

3120
02:19:38,331 --> 02:19:40,110
I'm sure you.
I'm sure you've heard that idea.

3121
02:19:40,460 --> 02:19:41,810
It's like,
okay,

3122
02:19:41,870 --> 02:19:44,000
let's say it doesn't have to be the 
Illuminati,

3123
02:19:44,001 --> 02:19:44,834
but let's say this world certainly runs 
better when we can keep the cattle like 

3124
02:19:49,490 --> 02:19:51,230
occupied and.
Okay,

3125
02:19:51,231 --> 02:19:53,900
so we try to put as many people in 
prison as we can.

3126
02:19:53,901 --> 02:19:56,090
If you see like documentaries like the 
13th and stuff,

3127
02:19:56,330 --> 02:19:58,190
that's one way to keep this.
This last year,

3128
02:19:58,340 --> 02:19:59,560
well how do we get these meds?
Oh,

3129
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:02,420
well let's infect them with the idea of 
consumerism,

3130
02:20:02,540 --> 02:20:05,540
so it's never enough.
Your happiness is always the next thing.

3131
02:20:05,541 --> 02:20:07,250
It's the next tv,
it's the next phone,

3132
02:20:07,530 --> 02:20:09,290
it's the next computer,
it's the next meal,

3133
02:20:09,291 --> 02:20:10,124
whatever it might be.

3134
02:20:10,230 --> 02:20:12,650
The next movie that you're gonna.
See whatever it could be.

3135
02:20:12,890 --> 02:20:16,610
So you're always in a state of lack 
going to keep you buying more money.

3136
02:20:16,940 --> 02:20:19,580
You need more money,
you need these things.

3137
02:20:19,581 --> 02:20:20,870
Back in the day,
you know,

3138
02:20:20,871 --> 02:20:23,600
you read the newspaper and drink a glass
of old team.

3139
02:20:23,840 --> 02:20:24,673
Now you have to have a netflix 
subscription and you got to have Amazon 

3140
02:20:27,051 --> 02:20:29,120
prime and all the shit.
So you're in debt,

3141
02:20:29,150 --> 02:20:29,983
you're chasing it and you're never gonna
get it and then at night you deserve it 

3142
02:20:32,901 --> 02:20:33,734
after your shit job to sit on the couch 
and zone out and that's how you keep us 

3143
02:20:36,951 --> 02:20:38,390
in line as well.
Yeah,

3144
02:20:38,391 --> 02:20:39,224
but I don't think that anyone.
I'm one of those people in engineering 

3145
02:20:41,481 --> 02:20:42,314
that thing.
I think that thing is a natural human 

3146
02:20:43,941 --> 02:20:44,774
inclination and I think it's also forced
along by people that are trying to sell 

3147
02:20:48,831 --> 02:20:52,760
you the new lexus or I do want you to 
buy these clothes,

3148
02:20:52,761 --> 02:20:55,880
or do you think wants can be encouraged.

3149
02:20:55,940 --> 02:20:56,773
I think we see that in other cultures 
where it's not as consumeristic as 

3150
02:21:00,340 --> 02:21:01,173
consumers stick is outward as ours is 
like we're certainly surrounded by 

3151
02:21:04,671 --> 02:21:07,100
advertising and all that.
A capitalist culture,

3152
02:21:07,370 --> 02:21:08,203
you know when you have capitalism and 
you have people that want to sell you 

3153
02:21:10,101 --> 02:21:13,010
the new apple laptop or the new android 
phone,

3154
02:21:13,310 --> 02:21:14,143
they're going to advertise that phone.
They're going to make it appealing 

3155
02:21:15,351 --> 02:21:16,184
because they wanted to sell well and if 
you have a really good advertising 

3156
02:21:18,681 --> 02:21:21,100
strategy,
you can sell more stuff and so your.

3157
02:21:21,101 --> 02:21:21,934
Your company becomes more successful but
you're not outwardly thinking or even 

3158
02:21:24,681 --> 02:21:26,840
inwardly thinking you're going to make 
more slaves.

3159
02:21:27,080 --> 02:21:27,913
They're going to make people that are 
forced into this consumeristic society 

3160
02:21:32,271 --> 02:21:37,271
and forced into this weird world weird 
world where you're living every day just

3161
02:21:37,701 --> 02:21:39,410
to buy new stuff and just to get new 
stuff.

3162
02:21:39,440 --> 02:21:44,440
It is sort of a symptom of the wrong way
of thinking and these traps it's society

3163
02:21:44,641 --> 02:21:45,474
set up for us,
but I don't think it's necessarily 

3164
02:21:47,031 --> 02:21:48,440
engineered in a whole.

3165
02:21:48,790 --> 02:21:49,623
So this is a,
this is a thing that people gravitate 

3166
02:21:52,281 --> 02:21:53,114
towards.
This idea that there's this cabal of 

3167
02:21:54,951 --> 02:21:56,470
super geniuses that are running the 
world.

3168
02:21:56,471 --> 02:21:59,270
I want to keep a stupid cheap.
I don't think that's true.

3169
02:21:59,271 --> 02:22:01,490
I think.
I think it's a self fulfilling thing.

3170
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:06,590
I think we create these walls and we 
create this prison.

3171
02:22:06,591 --> 02:22:10,130
We put up these bars and then we put 
ourselves inside and we lock them.

3172
02:22:10,220 --> 02:22:11,053
But this is what's interesting about 
mushrooms was something that's free and 

3173
02:22:13,191 --> 02:22:15,740
something that has.
There's no mushroom three point,

3174
02:22:15,741 --> 02:22:17,230
oh,
you don't have to get the new machine,

3175
02:22:17,360 --> 02:22:18,193
but it is illegal.
It is illegal because good citizens 

3176
02:22:20,541 --> 02:22:23,690
don't take psychedelics.
Obedient citizens don't know.

3177
02:22:23,700 --> 02:22:27,900
Was Jeff sessions was talking marijuana.
Good people don't use marijuana.

3178
02:22:27,901 --> 02:22:28,890
The same guy.
Yeah.

3179
02:22:28,900 --> 02:22:29,660
Yeah,
yeah.

3180
02:22:29,660 --> 02:22:30,493
And,
but you take that and you get a glimpse 

3181
02:22:32,340 --> 02:22:34,840
of real life.
I know it's very,

3182
02:22:35,160 --> 02:22:37,710
uh,
kind of exaggerated and bizarre,

3183
02:22:37,950 --> 02:22:41,610
but you get a sense that what we are and
who we are fundamentally can be very,

3184
02:22:41,611 --> 02:22:43,980
very interesting and worth exploring.

3185
02:22:44,400 --> 02:22:48,300
So to kind of also to your point,
the people that make the laptop and make

3186
02:22:48,301 --> 02:22:49,134
the ad campaign for the laptop,
I don't think are trying to control the 

3187
02:22:51,451 --> 02:22:53,280
world,
but I do think they like us.

3188
02:22:53,281 --> 02:22:54,114
We're also indoctrinated into a world 
where you can justify the idea that I'm 

3189
02:22:57,451 --> 02:22:59,290
just giving them what they want because 
they too are,

3190
02:22:59,450 --> 02:23:02,010
are stuck on that hedonic treadmill of 
like,

3191
02:23:02,011 --> 02:23:02,844
I need the next thing.
I need this job where I advertise this 

3192
02:23:04,921 --> 02:23:06,390
thing so I can go out and buy these 
things.

3193
02:23:06,420 --> 02:23:08,670
Well that's the case with television.
You know,

3194
02:23:08,671 --> 02:23:10,260
I had a conversation with a friend of 
mine.

3195
02:23:10,261 --> 02:23:11,940
He was like a super hippie.
He was trying to tell me,

3196
02:23:11,941 --> 02:23:14,220
you know what man?
Fuck in the United States,

3197
02:23:14,260 --> 02:23:15,093
man,
their programming people with these 

3198
02:23:16,020 --> 02:23:16,853
shows,
they're hypnotizing you to watch these 

3199
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:22,380
bullshit programs and you get locked 
into it and it's all by design.

3200
02:23:22,380 --> 02:23:23,340
I go,
here's why you're wrong.

3201
02:23:23,341 --> 02:23:25,640
Fuck face.
I work on those Goddamn show,

3202
02:23:25,641 --> 02:23:28,960
so I'm going to tell you the funny once 
you start writing for TV or like there's

3203
02:23:28,980 --> 02:23:30,270
no scale,
there's no.

3204
02:23:30,540 --> 02:23:33,060
There's no cabal of geniuses running and
by the way,

3205
02:23:33,061 --> 02:23:33,894
the people that are running these shows 
are hooked on other shows there in the 

3206
02:23:37,330 --> 02:23:37,800
shows.
I'm like,

3207
02:23:37,800 --> 02:23:39,500
I've seen game of thrones.
I'm hooked,

3208
02:23:39,960 --> 02:23:42,120
and they'll start telling you about all 
these fucking shows.

3209
02:23:42,121 --> 02:23:42,954
That day was as much as I love a good 
conspiracy like Matt gradings and the 

3210
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:48,660
and the masons,
and they're these clues about nine slash

3211
02:23:48,661 --> 02:23:49,494
11 and the simpsons and stuff,
and that can be fun and storytelling as 

3212
02:23:52,531 --> 02:23:54,480
such.
Once I started writing for TV shows,

3213
02:23:54,481 --> 02:23:55,261
I was like,
oh,

3214
02:23:55,261 --> 02:23:57,660
this is just a bunch of.
Not Dummies,

3215
02:23:57,690 --> 02:24:00,450
but regular folks like strange marriage.
Funny.

3216
02:24:00,451 --> 02:24:03,630
If a homeowner comes in and he's got 
blue pants,

3217
02:24:03,631 --> 02:24:04,080
you know what I mean?

3218
02:24:04,080 --> 02:24:04,913
Like right.
It's a strange marriage of art and 

3219
02:24:06,361 --> 02:24:07,530
commerce.
You know,

3220
02:24:07,531 --> 02:24:08,364
that's what it is.
So you're creating something and you're 

3221
02:24:09,541 --> 02:24:10,374
trying to sell it and as you're trying 
to sell it then to make ads and they 

3222
02:24:12,471 --> 02:24:16,080
make as stupid as what they're doing.
They're not.

3223
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:18,540
They're not trying to sell like,
do you think coke coke is trying to make

3224
02:24:18,541 --> 02:24:19,374
a stupid?
No,

3225
02:24:19,470 --> 02:24:21,740
they're trying to get.
You'd think that fucking polar bales,

3226
02:24:21,750 --> 02:24:24,050
your buddy.
I'm like Santa Claus drinks.

3227
02:24:24,051 --> 02:24:26,700
They're probably just trying to sell 
more shits.

3228
02:24:26,701 --> 02:24:29,880
They can make more money to go golfing 
or whatever the fuck they want to do and

3229
02:24:29,881 --> 02:24:31,900
they don't realize while they're doing 
it.

3230
02:24:31,920 --> 02:24:34,710
I do.
I think we want to enjoy this experience

3231
02:24:34,711 --> 02:24:35,544
as much as we can.
I think that's what we want to do that 

3232
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:39,750
at our best,
right at our best.

3233
02:24:39,751 --> 02:24:42,660
We're toasting,
we're clinking glasses were hugging each

3234
02:24:42,661 --> 02:24:43,590
other at our best.

3235
02:24:43,590 --> 02:24:45,840
We're laughing with friends at our best.
We're.

3236
02:24:46,150 --> 02:24:50,250
We're just having a good time together.
That's my favorite moments are me and my

3237
02:24:50,251 --> 02:24:51,084
buddies just laughing about something,
which is why comedians are so fun to 

3238
02:24:54,991 --> 02:24:55,824
hang out with and that's why I can't 
believe she left me for a guy named 

3239
02:24:59,611 --> 02:25:01,140
Rocco.
We probably had a giant hog.

3240
02:25:02,130 --> 02:25:05,920
I bet he did have a dream to have a big 
Dick.

3241
02:25:06,380 --> 02:25:07,010
Like,
yeah,

3242
02:25:07,010 --> 02:25:08,760
it's like a lot longer.
Well,

3243
02:25:08,761 --> 02:25:10,410
this is it.
When it's flat stock stock,

3244
02:25:10,411 --> 02:25:11,244
a couple of them.
This is him called pools and here comes 

3245
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:15,073
my cold pool.
Ruined or is there anything better than 

3246
02:25:19,231 --> 02:25:20,064
gaining perspective?
I think there's a vonnegut quote where 

3247
02:25:21,721 --> 02:25:22,950
he goes,
the best way to get in,

3248
02:25:23,170 --> 02:25:24,040
get over a woman

3249
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:27,760
is to turn her into fiction and there 
was something really Cathartic.

3250
02:25:27,840 --> 02:25:28,673
The sort of crashing is fiction.
My wife's character is completely 

3251
02:25:32,471 --> 02:25:34,300
different from my wife that situations 
are different,

3252
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:35,433
but it was still really fun.
There's an episode with my parents and 

3253
02:25:37,811 --> 02:25:38,644
I'm writing them saying the annoying 
shit and my parents say it's not 

3254
02:25:42,340 --> 02:25:44,980
listening.
My Mom's in love with me,

3255
02:25:44,981 --> 02:25:48,520
all these things and I was like,
this talk about zooming out.

3256
02:25:48,550 --> 02:25:50,920
You have like this weird dominion over 
it.

3257
02:25:51,160 --> 02:25:53,250
They call cut and you just,
you know,

3258
02:25:53,270 --> 02:25:54,103
that was just pretend that you're in it.
Then it's pretend it was like 10 years 

3259
02:25:58,001 --> 02:25:59,860
of therapy wrapped into a couple of 
months.

3260
02:25:59,861 --> 02:26:01,960
That's amazing.
Do you still contact her?

3261
02:26:02,410 --> 02:26:04,160
No,
it's not out of hate or anything.

3262
02:26:04,270 --> 02:26:06,440
I tend to move on,
just move on.

3263
02:26:06,610 --> 02:26:08,450
I don't,
I don't talk to accept.

3264
02:26:08,610 --> 02:26:10,420
My Ex's is a very dear friend of mine.

3265
02:26:10,670 --> 02:26:12,940
Um,
but the rest of them you're just kind of

3266
02:26:12,941 --> 02:26:13,774
like,
it's hard because you're intimate with 

3267
02:26:15,581 --> 02:26:20,290
somebody and you know you have sex and 
you kiss and you hug and you want to.

3268
02:26:21,310 --> 02:26:22,143
It takes a level of maturity but to have
lunch with someone whose breasts you've 

3269
02:26:25,640 --> 02:26:29,530
seen and just be like,
are you getting the soup?

3270
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:31,270
Yeah,
it's hard.

3271
02:26:31,271 --> 02:26:32,260
You know,
and then you know,

3272
02:26:32,261 --> 02:26:33,094
they tell you they're in love or they 
tell you they're getting married or 

3273
02:26:34,810 --> 02:26:35,650
having a kid,
you're like,

3274
02:26:35,800 --> 02:26:36,633
oh yeah,
that's why I'm so glad my ex got 

3275
02:26:40,421 --> 02:26:41,950
married.
She's coming to my wedding and,

3276
02:26:42,020 --> 02:26:43,850
and my,
and my girlfriend is very,

3277
02:26:43,930 --> 02:26:46,720
very close with her.
So I love it when it works out.

3278
02:26:46,721 --> 02:26:48,250
I never thought I'd be one of those 
people.

3279
02:26:48,690 --> 02:26:50,180
Oh.
But it's amazing when it works out,

3280
02:26:50,530 --> 02:26:51,520
it works out.
It's great.

3281
02:26:51,570 --> 02:26:54,640
And the idea that it can't work out as 
all silly too.

3282
02:26:54,670 --> 02:26:55,690
Of course it can.
You know,

3283
02:26:55,691 --> 02:26:56,524
I have friends that uh,
like one of my buddies dated this girl 

3284
02:26:59,801 --> 02:27:02,380
and then he broke up with her and my 
other buddy one I'm marrying her.

3285
02:27:02,640 --> 02:27:05,110
No,
their friends.

3286
02:27:05,230 --> 02:27:06,820
It's great.
It does happen.

3287
02:27:06,850 --> 02:27:08,830
It can happen.
It totally can happen.

3288
02:27:08,850 --> 02:27:09,683
Yeah.
It's just everybody's not right for 

3289
02:27:11,711 --> 02:27:12,850
everybody else.
Yeah.

3290
02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:15,850
There's certain people that will drive 
you fucking crazy.

3291
02:27:15,851 --> 02:27:18,100
But to someone out there,
it's the perfect person.

3292
02:27:18,101 --> 02:27:19,540
Well that's a funny tee shirt.
It's like,

3293
02:27:19,541 --> 02:27:22,510
no matter how much you love her,
someone somewhere is sick of her shit.

3294
02:27:22,570 --> 02:27:25,600
Have you seen those?
That's an old old statement,

3295
02:27:25,601 --> 02:27:27,160
right?
It's true.

3296
02:27:27,370 --> 02:27:28,120
Yeah.
Valid.

3297
02:27:28,120 --> 02:27:31,360
I have lived together for two years now 
and it's just,

3298
02:27:31,450 --> 02:27:33,430
it's just been the best.
That's awesome man.

3299
02:27:33,450 --> 02:27:37,690
Because you found that thing right with 
the finger slide into the grooves and it

3300
02:27:37,691 --> 02:27:41,620
works and it's like the idea that it's 
like if it doesn't do it,

3301
02:27:41,621 --> 02:27:42,820
it's because someone's a bad person.

3302
02:27:42,840 --> 02:27:43,481
It just.
No,

3303
02:27:43,481 --> 02:27:45,580
man.
I can't say that.

3304
02:27:45,581 --> 02:27:48,590
That's something I try and stay on.
You made it weird as much as possible as

3305
02:27:48,610 --> 02:27:50,260
you don't have to hate someone to break 
up with them.

3306
02:27:50,500 --> 02:27:51,333
It's good point.
I think you had to be throwing plates 

3307
02:27:54,581 --> 02:27:55,414
and screaming at each other and 
someone's an alcoholic and someone 

3308
02:27:58,181 --> 02:28:01,150
cheats on somebody.
It's okay to say,

3309
02:28:01,360 --> 02:28:03,950
I do love you.
I may regret this.

3310
02:28:03,970 --> 02:28:08,680
Like just concede and be like,
but I'd like to go and that's okay.

3311
02:28:08,830 --> 02:28:10,750
I just like to be free.
I'll tell you this story.

3312
02:28:11,050 --> 02:28:14,560
I was dating this girl who for me seemed
very crazy.

3313
02:28:14,650 --> 02:28:17,200
I know that gets thrown around a lot,
but I was like,

3314
02:28:17,201 --> 02:28:18,820
I think this person's a borderline 
personality,

3315
02:28:18,821 --> 02:28:22,460
all these different things.
I had this list in my phone,

3316
02:28:22,461 --> 02:28:27,290
in the notes file reasons to break up 
and it was 35,

3317
02:28:27,291 --> 02:28:28,190
45 things.

3318
02:28:28,190 --> 02:28:33,110
It was insane and any one of them would 
have been enough and I kept adding it to

3319
02:28:33,111 --> 02:28:35,510
it and go to my therapist.
Dr Gary Penn,

3320
02:28:35,511 --> 02:28:38,180
whose book is available now.
It's a joke I make on my podcast.

3321
02:28:38,560 --> 02:28:39,440
He's like,
Pete,

3322
02:28:39,441 --> 02:28:41,780
you don't need a list.
You don't need a list.

3323
02:28:41,990 --> 02:28:43,820
And that same week I had talked to a 
psychic.

3324
02:28:43,821 --> 02:28:48,821
I'm not huge into that stuff.
I know I told you I'm a believer and the

3325
02:28:49,671 --> 02:28:54,110
psychic is like someone is looking out 
for you in this regard in particular,

3326
02:28:54,111 --> 02:28:56,330
like they're rooting for you.
Whether or not that's true.

3327
02:28:56,540 --> 02:29:00,830
I held onto that and I'm driving from 
therapy where my therapist is like,

3328
02:29:00,831 --> 02:29:03,080
you don't need a list of reasons to 
break up with her,

3329
02:29:03,620 --> 02:29:04,700
and I'm like,
you're right,

3330
02:29:04,701 --> 02:29:05,534
you're right.
But I get in the car and I think of 

3331
02:29:06,021 --> 02:29:06,854
another one.
I'm in the highway and I take out my 

3332
02:29:09,051 --> 02:29:13,550
phone and I start writing down the 47th 
reason to break up with this person.

3333
02:29:14,090 --> 02:29:15,950
Phone crashes,
restarts,

3334
02:29:16,190 --> 02:29:17,720
opens up,
everything's the same.

3335
02:29:17,990 --> 02:29:19,790
That's.
That note was deleted.

3336
02:29:20,450 --> 02:29:21,283
Isn't that crazy?
And whether or not that's actually 

3337
02:29:22,761 --> 02:29:24,500
mystical.
It just meant something to me.

3338
02:29:24,501 --> 02:29:26,990
It was like fucking a.
If that's a coincidence,

3339
02:29:26,991 --> 02:29:29,240
who cares?
But it gave me the courage to be like,

3340
02:29:29,270 --> 02:29:31,850
I don't need a reason.
I want to bounce,

3341
02:29:32,170 --> 02:29:34,310
I'm going to bounce,
but I love you.

3342
02:29:34,400 --> 02:29:36,290
I love you too.
I don't like this.

3343
02:29:36,390 --> 02:29:37,223
Yeah.
I want to be attached and connected to 

3344
02:29:39,001 --> 02:29:41,780
you.
I'm sorry we had a good run.

3345
02:29:41,790 --> 02:29:46,790
Maybe we'll let me the fuck outta here.
I know you should be able to like people

3346
02:29:47,461 --> 02:29:48,800
that you don't want to have sex with 
anymore.

3347
02:29:48,810 --> 02:29:50,340
You don't want to be intimately attached
with.

3348
02:29:50,341 --> 02:29:53,160
And that's the other thing about people 
like intimate attachments.

3349
02:29:53,490 --> 02:29:55,380
When you have intimate attachments with 
someone,

3350
02:29:55,381 --> 02:29:56,890
like you have sex with them.
Yeah.

3351
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,850
You share carnal pleasure.
Boy,

3352
02:29:59,851 --> 02:30:04,490
there's some fucking weird things that 
happened where people get angrier.

3353
02:30:04,980 --> 02:30:08,970
You know they get fucking like the best 
thing you can do.

3354
02:30:09,150 --> 02:30:11,910
If you want to really have a fun 
relationship with someone,

3355
02:30:12,650 --> 02:30:16,650
and I've never done this,
hold off on the sex as long as you can.

3356
02:30:16,651 --> 02:30:18,490
Oh Wow.
I get to know the.

3357
02:30:18,491 --> 02:30:21,180
See if you really like each other,
see if you really like each other.

3358
02:30:21,220 --> 02:30:24,120
See if it's not just a thing where you'd
like should have been a Christian here.

3359
02:30:24,600 --> 02:30:27,030
Feels good inside their body.
That's what we do,

3360
02:30:27,090 --> 02:30:30,180
but he would court.
It's not the worst move.

3361
02:30:30,181 --> 02:30:33,440
The problem is we have this fucking 
desire for sex.

3362
02:30:33,441 --> 02:30:35,520
It's overwhelming.
You know,

3363
02:30:35,521 --> 02:30:38,670
it's like this,
this ticking time bomb inside your body.

3364
02:30:38,710 --> 02:30:41,700
Then we'll convince yourself like,
judy is great to have these great.

3365
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:42,600
Sure.
Convince Yourself.

3366
02:30:42,780 --> 02:30:45,180
Let's just fuck.
I got married to it in a bit.

3367
02:30:45,270 --> 02:30:47,700
We had sex before we got married,
but then he stopped again.

3368
02:30:47,701 --> 02:30:49,650
I know.
Don't tell him I stopped for awhile.

3369
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:50,513
Then we stopped because you want it to 
be good Christians kind of and then we 

3370
02:30:53,461 --> 02:30:54,294
knew we were getting married and then 
we're going to make the wedding night 

3371
02:30:55,770 --> 02:30:58,310
special.
Held off for a bit.

3372
02:30:58,380 --> 02:31:01,290
I was mostly for guilt and fear.
Probably couple of months.

3373
02:31:01,291 --> 02:31:04,140
Six months as Christ.
Did you guys have cuddle or anything?

3374
02:31:04,560 --> 02:31:06,020
I think so.
I don't hand jobs.

3375
02:31:06,040 --> 02:31:07,200
Nothing.
I don't know.

3376
02:31:07,260 --> 02:31:08,760
I definitely gave myself plenty of.

3377
02:31:11,820 --> 02:31:12,653
I know that I got married.
I remember even my father who wasn't 

3378
02:31:15,331 --> 02:31:18,360
very religious saying to me it's good to
get married.

3379
02:31:18,361 --> 02:31:20,100
Sex doesn't like you're getting away

3380
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:22,800
with something.
So there's this latent guilt,

3381
02:31:23,080 --> 02:31:25,440
like getting away with Shit.
That's part of the problem.

3382
02:31:26,090 --> 02:31:26,923
It's so funny.
I'd like you liked one of the things 

3383
02:31:28,501 --> 02:31:29,334
about married sex as opposed to single 
sex is like if you're just dating 

3384
02:31:33,811 --> 02:31:34,644
someone you don't know whether or not 
you're going to hook up like you don't 

3385
02:31:38,641 --> 02:31:40,260
know.
You don't know.

3386
02:31:40,280 --> 02:31:42,590
Are you going to come back to my place 
like,

3387
02:31:43,050 --> 02:31:45,210
yeah,
those are the moments I remember.

3388
02:31:45,211 --> 02:31:47,730
By the way,
am I single time and I remember the sex,

3389
02:31:47,731 --> 02:31:52,680
but I also remember the moment where you
put it out there and you were like,

3390
02:31:53,250 --> 02:31:57,150
you want to get out of here?
Or like some sort of the early days,

3391
02:31:57,180 --> 02:31:58,530
let's go,
you know,

3392
02:31:58,531 --> 02:32:00,990
my is great.
Let's go get room service or whatever it

3393
02:32:00,991 --> 02:32:01,824
is.
And then.

3394
02:32:02,100 --> 02:32:04,410
Or when a girl says that to you out of 
here,

3395
02:32:04,411 --> 02:32:05,244
I'm horny.

3396
02:32:05,970 --> 02:32:10,290
I,
I remember one time I was in Montreal at

3397
02:32:10,291 --> 02:32:11,124
the festival so I must've just gotten 
off stage because I just so confident 

3398
02:32:13,891 --> 02:32:16,080
and felt great and there was this girl,
beautiful girl.

3399
02:32:16,410 --> 02:32:18,120
I wanted to hook up with it and she was 
like,

3400
02:32:18,121 --> 02:32:19,200
you want to get a drink?
And I was like,

3401
02:32:19,201 --> 02:32:19,860
yeah,
let's go.

3402
02:32:19,860 --> 02:32:23,220
Let's get into the room.
Just immediately get crazy.

3403
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:24,360
Totally work,
no drinks,

3404
02:32:25,500 --> 02:32:30,500
drinks,
it's some people do and some people like

3405
02:32:31,201 --> 02:32:32,820
sex with some people.
Right.

3406
02:32:33,090 --> 02:32:33,923
But there's other people that you would 
have said that too and they've been 

3407
02:32:35,830 --> 02:32:36,760
like,
oh,

3408
02:32:36,810 --> 02:32:37,830
for sure.
And you know,

3409
02:32:37,831 --> 02:32:40,980
there's some people that would.
Afterwards we laughed about like,

3410
02:32:41,190 --> 02:32:43,180
who were you as like,
I don't even know anymore,

3411
02:32:43,360 --> 02:32:44,193
but as soon as I came I was like,
I don't know who that guy was that got 

3412
02:32:46,471 --> 02:32:49,110
you to try on these sweatpants.

3413
02:32:50,340 --> 02:32:51,270
Yeah.
Isn't that funny,

3414
02:32:51,271 --> 02:32:54,090
man?
The difference in the way the mind works

3415
02:32:54,091 --> 02:32:54,924
when the cloud of confusion is lifted.
Well that's why I'm interested in like 

3416
02:32:58,230 --> 02:33:00,600
werewolves and stuff.
The stories are so compelling.

3417
02:33:00,601 --> 02:33:01,620
I'm like,
Oh yeah,

3418
02:33:01,621 --> 02:33:06,480
because sex makes so much sense when it 
makes sense.

3419
02:33:06,940 --> 02:33:09,840
Then there's other times every comedian 
writes the sexist,

3420
02:33:09,841 --> 02:33:11,010
stupid bit.
Like every,

3421
02:33:11,250 --> 02:33:14,310
every comedian that I watched coming up 
at some point we'll have the like,

3422
02:33:14,820 --> 02:33:15,653
what's that all about?
You put your Dick in the EU because it 

3423
02:33:18,391 --> 02:33:22,020
is stupid,
but something like a transformation of a

3424
02:33:22,021 --> 02:33:24,570
werewolf happens and for some reason you
can't even eat.

3425
02:33:24,600 --> 02:33:26,190
You're just like,
I have to fuck.

3426
02:33:26,191 --> 02:33:27,024
It's a very,
it's almost violating something takes 

3427
02:33:28,981 --> 02:33:30,840
over and you're like,
I gotta fuck,

3428
02:33:30,841 --> 02:33:32,220
I got to see tents now.
Well,

3429
02:33:32,221 --> 02:33:35,640
it's clearly DNA.
It's clearly the need to procreate,

3430
02:33:35,670 --> 02:33:37,770
right?
It's a biological trick.

3431
02:33:37,800 --> 02:33:40,710
What a betrayal.
The urgency of trying to create,

3432
02:33:40,800 --> 02:33:45,800
trying to read a book and it's like ass,
but it's also enjoyable.

3433
02:33:45,930 --> 02:33:48,540
So it's like you got to revel in the 
enjoyable aspects of it.

3434
02:33:48,541 --> 02:33:48,910
I mean,
if,

3435
02:33:48,910 --> 02:33:49,743
if procreation was just simply this like
weird sort of pragmatic choice that you 

3436
02:33:54,661 --> 02:33:56,370
made.
Well we're running out of people.

3437
02:33:56,371 --> 02:33:57,660
We definitely have to procreate.
All right,

3438
02:33:57,661 --> 02:34:00,120
let's plan accordingly and set up a 
nursery.

3439
02:34:00,121 --> 02:34:01,200
Okay.
And then what are we going to do?

3440
02:34:01,320 --> 02:34:04,230
It's wonderful.
It's a fun game to be stuck in the game.

3441
02:34:04,320 --> 02:34:05,153
I remember that when I,
when I was single and I would hit on 

3442
02:34:06,811 --> 02:34:07,644
people or whatever,
I would sometimes have to remind myself 

3443
02:34:09,601 --> 02:34:10,860
like,
you love sex,

3444
02:34:10,890 --> 02:34:12,810
like I would have to [inaudible] you're 
going out and you're like,

3445
02:34:12,840 --> 02:34:15,460
I didn't want to go out and talk to the.
And you'd be like,

3446
02:34:15,810 --> 02:34:18,100
like I could hear my being like,
trust

3447
02:34:18,100 --> 02:34:20,200
me,
I'm doing this for us.

3448
02:34:21,470 --> 02:34:22,303
To really be happy once when it's 
actually happening and then I'd be in 

3449
02:34:25,061 --> 02:34:27,370
the bathroom like he was right?
Yeah.

3450
02:34:27,880 --> 02:34:29,260
Son of a bitch.
Yeah.

3451
02:34:29,261 --> 02:34:30,094
But which is the saddest thing when 
relationships deteriorate to that sort 

3452
02:34:33,040 --> 02:34:35,670
of maintenance sex place where they're 
just like that.

3453
02:34:35,680 --> 02:34:36,513
That's a lot.
Like a buddy of mine just got divorced 

3454
02:34:38,170 --> 02:34:39,780
and uh,
I was talking about,

3455
02:34:39,790 --> 02:34:40,271
he goes,
just,

3456
02:34:40,271 --> 02:34:45,010
we got to this point where it's just 
like maintenance x date night,

3457
02:34:45,110 --> 02:34:48,700
I guess we should do it now.
And it was just interested because there

3458
02:34:48,701 --> 02:34:49,534
is,
I've heard people that swear by that 

3459
02:34:52,451 --> 02:34:53,284
sort of thing,
even though it's completely 

3460
02:34:54,670 --> 02:34:56,590
dispassionate and it's not romantic at 
all,

3461
02:34:56,860 --> 02:34:58,510
but they're like,
you have to keep fucking.

3462
02:34:58,570 --> 02:35:01,600
Even if it does seem routine because it 
keeps you connected.

3463
02:35:01,870 --> 02:35:02,703
Like spirituality,
get it out of the way when you're 

3464
02:35:04,601 --> 02:35:04,960
fucking.

3465
02:35:04,960 --> 02:35:05,793
Like,
I knew a guy who was about to get 

3466
02:35:06,251 --> 02:35:07,900
divorced and he was like,
please,

3467
02:35:07,901 --> 02:35:08,734
we just need to have sex.
Like I know we don't really like each 

3468
02:35:11,081 --> 02:35:12,730
other right now,
but just let,

3469
02:35:12,760 --> 02:35:15,040
let,
let's do it to see if it.

3470
02:35:15,340 --> 02:35:16,173
Because you have sex with somebody.
I would have sex with somebody that I 

3471
02:35:18,191 --> 02:35:20,010
had just met and after you have sex you 
just,

3472
02:35:20,050 --> 02:35:21,400
you just kinda like,
oh,

3473
02:35:21,420 --> 02:35:23,890
woke to the potential of how great they 
might be.

3474
02:35:23,920 --> 02:35:24,753
You know,
you're just like,

3475
02:35:25,060 --> 02:35:26,590
oh my God,
I feel so close.

3476
02:35:26,620 --> 02:35:27,453
Well,
there's definitely some strange and it 

3477
02:35:28,960 --> 02:35:32,770
was a communication through sensuality,
right?

3478
02:35:33,170 --> 02:35:34,003
This is like touching and kissing and 
licking and fun and just all that stuff 

3479
02:35:37,511 --> 02:35:38,344
like con contributes to the,
your appreciation of the person you're 

3480
02:35:42,460 --> 02:35:43,293
bonding and some strange way,
which is why people get so angry when 

3481
02:35:45,940 --> 02:35:50,080
you break up because it's like you're 
taking away like a piece of them,

3482
02:35:50,081 --> 02:35:52,930
like they've invested in you and they 
like their,

3483
02:35:52,931 --> 02:35:55,480
their,
their roots of like connected to you.

3484
02:35:55,550 --> 02:35:57,440
Have you seen vanilla sky?
Remember that movie?

3485
02:35:57,460 --> 02:36:01,660
I don't remember it though.
Some time ago is driving a car and she's

3486
02:36:01,661 --> 02:36:03,580
breaking.
Tom Cruise is breaking up with her,

3487
02:36:03,720 --> 02:36:05,320
so real nightmare.
She starts driving really,

3488
02:36:05,321 --> 02:36:07,390
really fast.
They ended up crashing into off a bridge

3489
02:36:07,900 --> 02:36:09,550
and that's why I asked to wear that 
mask,

3490
02:36:09,551 --> 02:36:10,540
the whole moving.
Anyway,

3491
02:36:10,930 --> 02:36:13,660
so she's mad at him for breaking up with
her and she goes,

3492
02:36:13,720 --> 02:36:16,420
it's such as the perfect horror movie 
moment.

3493
02:36:16,600 --> 02:36:18,160
She goes,
I swallowed.

3494
02:36:18,161 --> 02:36:18,994
You come.
And it's just film version of exactly 

3495
02:36:23,051 --> 02:36:25,090
what you're talking about.
Like there's a bond.

3496
02:36:25,120 --> 02:36:25,953
Even if it's casual,
there's something going on where it's 

3497
02:36:28,451 --> 02:36:28,961
Kinda like,
hey,

3498
02:36:28,961 --> 02:36:32,410
fuck you man.
In that magical place together,

3499
02:36:32,411 --> 02:36:33,430
you're going to act like that was 
nothing.

3500
02:36:33,520 --> 02:36:35,740
I don't think sex is nothing.
I've had casual sex.

3501
02:36:35,741 --> 02:36:38,290
I've enjoyed casual sex.
I think people should have casual sex,

3502
02:36:38,650 --> 02:36:41,590
but their Qa,
I believe people when they're like,

3503
02:36:41,650 --> 02:36:44,350
hey,
that meant more to me than it did to you

3504
02:36:44,380 --> 02:36:45,250
male or female.

3505
02:36:45,400 --> 02:36:46,233
Well,
there's also this thing where people 

3506
02:36:47,081 --> 02:36:50,500
were rejected where it hurts,
it hurts really bad.

3507
02:36:50,501 --> 02:36:52,990
Like being rejected her.
It's like one of the things that,

3508
02:36:52,991 --> 02:36:56,000
um,
I remember I had this friend and uh,

3509
02:36:56,070 --> 02:36:56,903
I was stopped being friends with him 
because he would get real upset when 

3510
02:36:59,591 --> 02:37:02,200
women would turn them down and he,
it was,

3511
02:37:02,230 --> 02:37:03,063
it was,
it was hurting him because he wasn't an 

3512
02:37:04,571 --> 02:37:07,690
attractive guy and he was kind of 
awkward and he would try to hit on girls

3513
02:37:07,960 --> 02:37:12,520
and it wasn't working and when it wasn't
working he would get angry and I saw him

3514
02:37:12,521 --> 02:37:13,354
deteriorate psychologically over the 
years because like he didn't have a 

3515
02:37:15,951 --> 02:37:16,220
girl,

3516
02:37:16,220 --> 02:37:18,170
he had one girlfriend,
she fucked around,

3517
02:37:18,180 --> 02:37:20,060
Ahm.
And then he just didn't.

3518
02:37:20,300 --> 02:37:23,960
He just dated for awhile and then he 
became more and more bitter.

3519
02:37:23,961 --> 02:37:24,794
And what was going on was this,
he was associating women with rejection 

3520
02:37:29,120 --> 02:37:29,953
and with that bad feeling of just being 
turned down and despised like you that 

3521
02:37:37,040 --> 02:37:37,873
like,
oh,

3522
02:37:37,880 --> 02:37:41,510
that devastating feelings to him was his
connection with women.

3523
02:37:41,660 --> 02:37:42,493
I think this is why we see a lot of 
degradation and straight up aggression 

3524
02:37:46,191 --> 02:37:50,600
in pornography for sure.
Mad At holding women.

3525
02:37:50,840 --> 02:37:54,530
It's kind of the grownup version of your
mother's tit going dry.

3526
02:37:54,531 --> 02:37:56,320
I'm not even trying to be frank,
I know what you're saying.

3527
02:37:56,360 --> 02:37:58,580
Colicky baby.
When I was single,

3528
02:37:58,581 --> 02:38:01,760
I remember very vividly because it 
scared the hell out of me to be honest.

3529
02:38:01,761 --> 02:38:04,400
And this is kind of vulnerable,
but you gotta have good audience.

3530
02:38:04,930 --> 02:38:06,540
Uh,
I remember I was,

3531
02:38:06,590 --> 02:38:08,240
I was actually,
it was weird.

3532
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:10,640
I was with two girls and I was trying to
make that happen and it didn't.

3533
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:15,620
And I got in the elevator and I felt 
like a colicky baby,

3534
02:38:15,621 --> 02:38:18,700
like a teething baby.
I didn't do anything right.

3535
02:38:19,130 --> 02:38:22,190
But if I had,
if I didn't have the self restraint,

3536
02:38:22,191 --> 02:38:23,150
I would've,
I would've been like,

3537
02:38:23,151 --> 02:38:25,640
wow.
I just felt like,

3538
02:38:25,970 --> 02:38:28,080
how can you not pick me up?
Right,

3539
02:38:28,090 --> 02:38:29,100
right.
Put all this.

3540
02:38:29,270 --> 02:38:33,680
You feel like it's owed you.
You're like getting all those drinks.

3541
02:38:33,681 --> 02:38:34,514
And I was so charming.
And you feel like a kid that got yanked 

3542
02:38:38,060 --> 02:38:39,020
from love.
Well,

3543
02:38:39,021 --> 02:38:40,970
there's also the thing that we were 
talking about,

3544
02:38:40,971 --> 02:38:45,380
like when the Werewolf kicks in and you 
want to fuck so bad and you know,

3545
02:38:45,381 --> 02:38:46,214
that it could possibly happen.
So there's this moment where you're 

3546
02:38:48,341 --> 02:38:49,174
like,
just to where we'll get to come out as 

3547
02:38:50,230 --> 02:38:52,370
you get to come out and they're like,
you know,

3548
02:38:52,380 --> 02:38:55,760
and also will you love the like I need 
you.

3549
02:38:55,970 --> 02:38:58,250
That's another thing that's happening in
sex,

3550
02:38:58,251 --> 02:38:59,840
right?
Is someone saying,

3551
02:38:59,841 --> 02:39:03,110
I see your animal side and I celebrate 
it.

3552
02:39:03,540 --> 02:39:08,540
That's the opposite of a nun slapping 
you with how bad boyfriend they want you

3553
02:39:09,141 --> 02:39:09,974
to feel pleasure.
They want you to come out and be 

3554
02:39:11,121 --> 02:39:12,780
yourself.
That's how at the moon together,

3555
02:39:13,560 --> 02:39:14,490
like you said,
carnal,

3556
02:39:14,590 --> 02:39:15,423
carnal,
and it's beautiful and you're there and 

3557
02:39:16,941 --> 02:39:19,790
if you have added three way and the more
the merrier.

3558
02:39:19,820 --> 02:39:20,653
There's witnesses,
there's like a notary fucking and 

3559
02:39:23,361 --> 02:39:25,730
there's someone else kind like this is 
amazing.

3560
02:39:25,731 --> 02:39:28,640
You know what I'm saying?
That's healing.

3561
02:39:28,940 --> 02:39:31,640
Talk about the other thing,
like I remember pornography.

3562
02:39:31,641 --> 02:39:32,474
I think guys and maybe women to have a 
certain shame associated with just the 

3563
02:39:37,371 --> 02:39:40,400
functionality or like why do we love 
Dick Jokes?

3564
02:39:40,401 --> 02:39:41,870
We love them.
They kill.

3565
02:39:42,050 --> 02:39:42,883
We don't talk about it so weird that our
whole species runs off of these fucking 

3566
02:39:47,571 --> 02:39:51,230
little tubes that fill with blood and 
common jet out from your body,

3567
02:39:51,231 --> 02:39:56,231
like a diving board for a mouse and look
and when you're watching porn,

3568
02:39:56,960 --> 02:39:59,060
girls are just like so excited.

3569
02:39:59,060 --> 02:40:00,710
So into it.
It's all an act,

3570
02:40:00,711 --> 02:40:01,700
I,
I'm assuming,

3571
02:40:01,910 --> 02:40:02,743
but that's why it's like I read this 
book called pornified and they were 

3572
02:40:05,181 --> 02:40:07,430
like,
men have ejaculation.

3573
02:40:07,431 --> 02:40:10,250
Shame because anytime anything comes out
of your body,

3574
02:40:10,251 --> 02:40:11,084
it's kind of gross.
You're just like shit or snide and your 

3575
02:40:14,071 --> 02:40:15,600
Dick Sneezes.
This.

3576
02:40:15,640 --> 02:40:18,030
Where does this theory come from?
Ejaculation.

3577
02:40:18,031 --> 02:40:19,200
Shame.
I don't know.

3578
02:40:19,500 --> 02:40:20,333
I'm sure it was in the footnotes,
but I just remember that she mentioned 

3579
02:40:22,171 --> 02:40:23,004
it and I was calling like,
that seems to make sense to me and 

3580
02:40:24,721 --> 02:40:27,210
that's why you have girls.
I'm not even trying to be funny.

3581
02:40:27,211 --> 02:40:29,730
Guzzling come drinking,
come face comes.

3582
02:40:30,180 --> 02:40:30,721
Oh,
come on.

3583
02:40:30,721 --> 02:40:34,550
My faith.
I think it's solving takeaway.

3584
02:40:34,560 --> 02:40:36,900
Even if it's just ejaculations,
it's something going,

3585
02:40:37,140 --> 02:40:39,540
I know you're a wild animal and I accept
you.

3586
02:40:40,220 --> 02:40:41,130
You know what I'm saying?
Well,

3587
02:40:41,131 --> 02:40:44,230
I'm the opposite of grossed out.
I'm turned on by it by what?

3588
02:40:44,320 --> 02:40:46,410
But you know what I'm saying,
like woman.

3589
02:40:46,770 --> 02:40:47,603
Yeah.
I wonder if it's the same if you don't 

3590
02:40:51,391 --> 02:40:53,010
know.
I can't think of a female equivalent,

3591
02:40:53,011 --> 02:40:53,844
but like if you have,
if you don't care that your girls under 

3592
02:40:55,570 --> 02:40:57,810
her period or whatever and you love 
them,

3593
02:40:58,350 --> 02:41:00,180
not in spite of that,
you love them through that.

3594
02:41:00,181 --> 02:41:02,710
I think that's also kind of in the 
ballpark of like,

3595
02:41:03,150 --> 02:41:04,290
dude,
I get it.

3596
02:41:04,510 --> 02:41:05,343
We're stuck in these things,
these weird space suits that have these 

3597
02:41:08,200 --> 02:41:11,970
shit comes out of here and he blood 
comes out of here.

3598
02:41:12,050 --> 02:41:13,230
Okay,
all alright,

3599
02:41:13,470 --> 02:41:14,970
let's dance.
But at the end of it,

3600
02:41:15,480 --> 02:41:16,313
there's something going on somewhere,
whether it's between your eyes or 

3601
02:41:18,781 --> 02:41:19,614
somewhere where consciousness resides 
and that consciousness is also trapped 

3602
02:41:22,831 --> 02:41:24,630
in these,
these desires and these,

3603
02:41:24,900 --> 02:41:26,570
these biological needs.
Yeah.

3604
02:41:26,860 --> 02:41:27,693
That's,
that's,

3605
02:41:27,810 --> 02:41:29,880
that's where Rhonda is really helps me.
Where it was like,

3606
02:41:29,881 --> 02:41:32,340
you just try and watch it unfolding you.

3607
02:41:32,460 --> 02:41:33,570
You're,
you're the witness.

3608
02:41:33,571 --> 02:41:34,404
You know what it's like to step into the
witness and your tanks or however it is 

3609
02:41:36,931 --> 02:41:38,310
and you're like,
when I go,

3610
02:41:38,311 --> 02:41:40,740
I'm horny.
It's really the witness going,

3611
02:41:40,800 --> 02:41:42,780
Oh shit,
we're getting the horny signal.

3612
02:41:43,060 --> 02:41:44,580
Yeah.
I always thought that was my brain,

3613
02:41:44,581 --> 02:41:47,590
but I'm like,
there's something watching the brain and

3614
02:41:47,630 --> 02:41:48,463
interpreting it and the more I can be in
that kind of the yogis call it like the 

3615
02:41:52,261 --> 02:41:53,094
unflattering candle.
Like you keep your consciousness still 

3616
02:41:55,710 --> 02:41:56,543
even in the middle of a heated argument 
or in the middle of some serious 

3617
02:41:58,891 --> 02:41:59,724
fucking.
You're still kind of in the back 

3618
02:42:01,921 --> 02:42:04,560
watching it like television,
like Holy Shit.

3619
02:42:05,220 --> 02:42:06,240
Like Ram Dass says,
great thing.

3620
02:42:06,241 --> 02:42:08,010
I think this is helpful.
It helps me.

3621
02:42:08,380 --> 02:42:10,710
If you're anxious or depressed,
you go like,

3622
02:42:10,711 --> 02:42:15,090
who's noticing the depression?
And you try and sit in there and you go,

3623
02:42:15,420 --> 02:42:17,580
there's depression.
Holy Shit.

3624
02:42:18,180 --> 02:42:19,620
I wonder if I'm going to make it through
this.

3625
02:42:19,620 --> 02:42:22,470
This is some fucking heavy shit.
But if you're there,

3626
02:42:22,590 --> 02:42:23,221
like,
did you read,

3627
02:42:23,221 --> 02:42:24,054
uh,
the power now?

3628
02:42:24,870 --> 02:42:25,860
It was a totally,
totally.

3629
02:42:26,190 --> 02:42:27,540
Um,
I listen to it on tape.

3630
02:42:27,570 --> 02:42:28,700
Yeah,
it's better on days.

3631
02:42:29,070 --> 02:42:30,810
He has that great point where he's 
depressed.

3632
02:42:30,811 --> 02:42:31,644
He's,
he's thinking about killing himself and 

3633
02:42:33,001 --> 02:42:35,760
he has this thought where he goes,
I can't live with myself.

3634
02:42:35,970 --> 02:42:37,210
And he's like,
who is the,

3635
02:42:37,990 --> 02:42:42,990
I can't live with myself.
Who's the eye watching the myself?

3636
02:42:43,171 --> 02:42:46,480
And then he slipped into that dude 
becomes like,

3637
02:42:46,620 --> 02:42:48,150
I don't know if he's enlightened or 
what,

3638
02:42:48,151 --> 02:42:51,030
but he's got some dope ass shit.
They say he does.

3639
02:42:51,630 --> 02:42:53,760
So do you beat home?
I didn't mean to go on a tear.

3640
02:42:53,830 --> 02:42:54,820
That was great,
man.

3641
02:42:54,821 --> 02:42:56,100
That's a good way to end this thing,
man.

3642
02:42:56,101 --> 02:42:58,110
We just did three hours.
We did not.

3643
02:42:58,140 --> 02:42:59,070
Yeah,
it's 2:00.

3644
02:42:59,280 --> 02:43:01,740
You can read this clock.
That clock right there.

3645
02:43:02,010 --> 02:43:04,980
I've double up on clocks are clocks 
everywhere in this place.

3646
02:43:05,310 --> 02:43:07,470
Back there.
I got to say I'm so honored.

3647
02:43:07,471 --> 02:43:09,740
I'm a fan obviously too,
was just fine.

3648
02:43:09,750 --> 02:43:11,080
It meant a lot.
I really appreciate it.

3649
02:43:11,081 --> 02:43:12,280
I really enjoyed our conversation.

3650
02:43:12,280 --> 02:43:13,830
It was really cool.
We kept other.

3651
02:43:14,320 --> 02:43:17,110
I also want to get it.
This is the hemp oil,

3652
02:43:17,111 --> 02:43:19,870
but is it maybe I told you about.
It's called Charlotte's web.

3653
02:43:20,170 --> 02:43:23,080
Oh cool.
It's like it's cbd without thc.

3654
02:43:23,140 --> 02:43:25,030
Oh Great.
So it's not psychoactive.

3655
02:43:25,120 --> 02:43:25,841
Oh Man.
You know.

3656
02:43:25,841 --> 02:43:26,674
Uh,
I know a lot of people that live off 

3657
02:43:27,911 --> 02:43:29,530
this stuff body.
I take it.

3658
02:43:29,550 --> 02:43:31,330
Here's the great thing,
you can read on it,

3659
02:43:31,360 --> 02:43:33,220
you can do sets on it,
write on it.

3660
02:43:33,221 --> 02:43:36,520
It's completely functional,
but there's just a whisper of like,

3661
02:43:37,330 --> 02:43:38,530
I'm good.
Like you're a little bit.

3662
02:43:38,680 --> 02:43:40,720
You have a glow.
You're a little bit quicker to laugh.

3663
02:43:40,750 --> 02:43:43,320
Well,
the anti inflammation properties of it,

3664
02:43:43,360 --> 02:43:44,193
the anti inflammatory properties of it,
I'm sure that affects just overall 

3665
02:43:48,010 --> 02:43:48,843
wellness.
Yeah.

3666
02:43:48,880 --> 02:43:49,713
Well they made it for a girl named 
Charlotte who was having seizures and 

3667
02:43:51,731 --> 02:43:54,130
the only thing that would help is this.

3668
02:43:54,160 --> 02:43:56,810
That's why it's called Charlotte's web.
You don't want this creepy d,

3669
02:43:56,940 --> 02:43:57,850
d,
e a.

3670
02:43:57,851 --> 02:44:02,320
we're dealing with this.
I know the tyrannical organization.

3671
02:44:02,380 --> 02:44:03,940
They're trying to make this schedule 
one.

3672
02:44:03,970 --> 02:44:04,803
It's horrible.
It's non-psychoactive doesn't hurt 

3673
02:44:06,521 --> 02:44:08,650
anybody,
but I can into my mom.

3674
02:44:08,651 --> 02:44:11,770
I can't give it to teenagers.
I've given it to great stuff and they're

3675
02:44:11,771 --> 02:44:13,620
like,
oh my anxiety's lowered.

3676
02:44:13,660 --> 02:44:15,100
Where can people find this stuff?
Well,

3677
02:44:15,101 --> 02:44:17,260
