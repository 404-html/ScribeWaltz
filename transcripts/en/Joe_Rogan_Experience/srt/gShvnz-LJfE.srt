1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,180
Five,
four,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,680
three,
two,

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,760
one.
And we're live a welcome aboard.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,550
Jessica Rosenworcel.
Did I do it?

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,190
You did.
I was so nervous about that.

6
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:16,050
And Eddie won,
of course,

7
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:19,800
has been on the podcast many times.
Number one podcast in the world.

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:20,371
Oh,
thank you.

9
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:21,510
You are.
What's up brother?

10
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:22,950
How are you?
I'm chilling man.

11
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:24,180
I'm good.
I just,

12
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,700
you know,
I wanted to introduce you to the Homie,

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,980
the commissioner from the FCC,
Jessica Rosenworcel because things,

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,290
things where things are bad for the
Internet right now.

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,380
Well you are very concerned and a lot of
people are about net neutrality and uh,

16
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,290
we all have some questions about it and
we're excited to talk to you about it.

17
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:46,320
So maybe we could eliminate some of the
issues and,

18
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,040
and give us a,
an understanding or try to help us

19
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:53,640
understand what's at stake here and why
are people so concerned?

20
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,510
Well,
I think people are concerned because the

21
00:00:56,511 --> 00:00:58,880
future of the Internet.
So the future of everything.

22
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,910
I mean,
every aspect of our lives is now touched

23
00:01:01,911 --> 00:01:04,910
by that connectivity and it's a funny
thing,

24
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,160
but the agency where I work in
Washington,

25
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:12,161
the Federal Communications Commission
has enormous power and control over our

26
00:01:12,351 --> 00:01:16,760
internet experience and for decades
we've had these policies that have been

27
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,720
all about Internet openness and what
that means is you can go where you want,

28
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:25,640
do what you want online and your
broadband provider can't get in the way

29
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,530
or prevent you from looking at some
websites are looking at some videos or

30
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:34,970
setting up some businesses,
but that changed last month in

31
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:39,971
Washington when the FCC over my
objections voted to end net neutrality

32
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:47,090
and as a result,
all of our broadband providers now have

33
00:01:47,091 --> 00:01:52,091
the legal right to block websites,
to throttle content,

34
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,940
and to set up sweetheart paid for
prioritization deals and over the long

35
00:01:58,341 --> 00:02:01,610
haul.
That could really change the Internet

36
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,140
and the web as we know it.

37
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,210
Now.
What are the arguments?

38
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,470
Pro Net neutrality?
I'm one of the arguments for people that

39
00:02:09,471 --> 00:02:12,740
were excited about this being signed
when they were saying that net

40
00:02:12,741 --> 00:02:17,741
neutrality was really only over the last
couple of years and before the last

41
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,840
couple of years,
net neutrality as we know it the last

42
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,410
couple of years,
everything was fine and that it'll

43
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,000
continue to be fine and that people are
just panicked and there was that really

44
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:30,020
bizarre video that that one dude made
where he was sharing that these are all

45
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:31,340
the things you're going to be able to
do.

46
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,780
You work with that cat.
I do a pie.

47
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,440
Yeah.
He seems like an odd fellow.

48
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,320
Yeah.

49
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,150
Yeah.
Well,

50
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,120
uh,
he's a,

51
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,100
he's a smart guy.
He's a seasoned lawyer.

52
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:46,350
I think it's fair to say he and I see
the world a little bit

53
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,353
differently.
Yeah.

54
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,640
So he doesn't,
he sees this through the eyes of big

55
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:51,451
business,
right?

56
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:56,451
He thinks that this is a free market,
let the market decide and um,

57
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,170
and that's what the argument.
I mean,

58
00:02:58,171 --> 00:02:59,650
I've even heard mark Cuban was

59
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,140
arguing against it,
so I was like,

60
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:03,460
wow,
this is stunning.

61
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,623
Yeah.
Noodle.

62
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,570
For me,
the net neutrality thing is huge because

63
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,390
when I was in law school,
I read this one book called fighting for

64
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:13,800
air and it documented like the
telecommunications act in [inaudible]

65
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:15,670
97.
It's like boring stuff,

66
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,670
right?
Don't go read the Telecommunications Act

67
00:03:17,671 --> 00:03:20,360
in [inaudible] 97,
but like radio mattered to me.

68
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,890
Remember like growing up with the radio,
like I remember they would actually

69
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:25,720
break records on the radio back in the
day,

70
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:28,750
like funk flux still does it on hot 97
and he'll break records.

71
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:31,390
He broke my boy old drew's record the
other day,

72
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:35,680
but like recently it's like clear
channel Iheartradio.

73
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:40,060
They own all the radio stations and it
really sterilized content and they play

74
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:44,530
the same songs every hour in every city
almost around the world.

75
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,830
And I.
When I read that book and I went to law

76
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:49,090
school,
I realized I was like,

77
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:54,040
Yo,
it was because of the deregulation of

78
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:59,041
radio that allowed for all these local
independent radio stations in every city

79
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:02,650
that we're wrapping local culture and
state culture.

80
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,000
That kind of eroded that means of
communication.

81
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,760
And I was like,
this happens to every single industry we

82
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:10,930
have,
whether it's radio,

83
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:13,750
television,
but now it's coming for the Internet and

84
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:16,210
by deregulating it you're gonna gut it
again.

85
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,020
And you know,
like when,

86
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,290
when technology started popping in,
podcast came around.

87
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:24,760
I mean that's what enabled jre and
that's why my first place to goes like

88
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,850
I'm a come see jail because you were one
of the innovators with this new

89
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:31,024
technology.

90
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,413
Well

91
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,500
thanks.
But I think what people are super

92
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:39,930
concerned about is things getting
blocked,

93
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,180
right?
That's like one of the first ones.

94
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,020
Is that something that we legitimately
have to worry,

95
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,853
I worry about?

96
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,880
Is it?
Good question.

97
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,100
Here's what I know right now.
Your broadband provider has the

98
00:04:52,101 --> 00:04:55,940
technical ability to block content and
websites.

99
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,430
It's got the business incentive to block
or slow access to some websites if they

100
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,710
don't have a special commercial
relationship with them.

101
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,010
So now the FCC just gave them the legal
green.

102
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:09,170
Right?
Just go ahead.

103
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,060
And so I feel over time this is
something we need to be concerned about.

104
00:05:14,061 --> 00:05:16,520
And so this open platform that was full
of independent,

105
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,960
independent voices,
now you've got this new gatekeeper,

106
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,790
your broadband provider,
they've got a lot more power than what

107
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,660
they used to.
How close was the vote?

108
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,370
It was three.
Two.

109
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,840
And what's the argument for this?
Well,

110
00:05:32,841 --> 00:05:33,710
that's,
that's fair.

111
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,950
Um,
I think there's an argument that you

112
00:05:36,951 --> 00:05:40,610
want government out of the way
deregulation is going to lead to more

113
00:05:40,611 --> 00:05:45,611
competition and we'll have a flourishing
of new ideas and content if we just

114
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:47,690
moved government out of the way.

115
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,810
And even if you're sympathetic to that
argument,

116
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:55,080
here's where I think it breaks down
according to the FCC,

117
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:57,740
his own data,
half of the households this country

118
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,390
don't have a choice of broadband
provider.

119
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,910
I am familiar with this.
I'm one of them,

120
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,250
only have one provider that serves my
house.

121
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,040
So the thing is,
if you're a broadband provider started

122
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:11,900
blocking your content or throttling your
access to some video in a competitive

123
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:12,860
market,
you'd pick up,

124
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:16,460
you take your business somewhere else.
But about half of our households don't

125
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:20,030
even have that opportunity.
So to me,

126
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:25,031
the idea that the competitive market
will prevent this behavior just doesn't

127
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:25,934
fly.

128
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,730
Yeah.
That doesn't seem to make sense.

129
00:06:27,731 --> 00:06:29,530
And that that's an issue in my
neighborhood as well.

130
00:06:29,531 --> 00:06:31,180
And a lot of other people I know as
well.

131
00:06:31,181 --> 00:06:34,000
I mean,
I think they make deals where only one

132
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,700
company,
whether it's verizon or whatever,

133
00:06:36,701 --> 00:06:37,660
has an area.

134
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,590
Yeah.
They monopolize the areas.

135
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:43,700
They limit the opportunities and choices
and when they say deregulation,

136
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,790
it just anytime they deregulate things
and say,

137
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,170
hey,
we're going to leave it to the market

138
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:51,290
and have competition,
I think it's impossible to have that

139
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,360
when you have a country with such an
inequality,

140
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,520
income inequality gap.
Right.

141
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,280
That's the problem is that all right,
let's all go compete Joe.

142
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:00,620
You're not going to start a verizon.
I'm not going to start a verizon.

143
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,080
You know what I mean?
Like we can't compete with these dudes

144
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:05,870
and even comcast can't even compete with
verizon.

145
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,390
Like you know,
these dudes were all getting smashed.

146
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:12,800
So there is not actual competition.
I think deregulation works when you have

147
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:17,090
multiple players and options and that
the market actually can come into play.

148
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,240
But with the economy,
so top heavy right now,

149
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,700
I don't think there is a possibility of
company.

150
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:23,670
Yeah,
I mean listen,

151
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,250
competition is the best regulator we
know,

152
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,410
right?
We want there to be these markets where

153
00:07:28,411 --> 00:07:33,300
consumers have lots and lots of choices.
But if competition is an existing,

154
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,780
you need a little oversight to make sure
that every consumer gets a fair shot.

155
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,320
Well,
it seems like that's where the real

156
00:07:38,321 --> 00:07:40,750
argument lies,
that if there are monopolies and there

157
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:45,730
seemed to be in certain areas with in
regards to what kind of Internet access

158
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:49,150
you can get,
that if you don't have regulation,

159
00:07:49,151 --> 00:07:52,240
then then what is going to protect the
consumer and what is going to protect

160
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,610
free speech.
What's going to protect it?

161
00:07:54,611 --> 00:07:57,700
Say if you are on verizon and your
system is on verizon,

162
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,990
what have you decided to make a podcast
that criticizes verizon and everybody

163
00:08:01,991 --> 00:08:02,440
says,
you know,

164
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,090
hey,
Eddie [inaudible] got a podcast

165
00:08:04,091 --> 00:08:05,980
criticizing us.
I want to shut that down.

166
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,023
And they can just.

167
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,950
I would have been shut down a long time
ago.

168
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

169
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,610
We're not saying that they would do
that,

170
00:08:12,611 --> 00:08:14,150
but they could.
Yeah.

171
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,540
And that's what's scary,
that's not good,

172
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,550
you know,
so much of our speech these days,

173
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,900
it doesn't take place in public places.
It takes place on these private

174
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:26,770
platforms.
So they have a lot of power and we have

175
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:29,440
to think about that as a,
as a country in a democracy,

176
00:08:29,441 --> 00:08:34,420
how much openness do we want?
And then how do we create a framework in

177
00:08:34,421 --> 00:08:37,540
Washington that supports that openness.
And that's really to me what net

178
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,374
neutrality is.

179
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,560
The other question I have is right,
let's say I'm the,

180
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:47,660
you know,
versus let's say a service provider Buys

181
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,320
Hulu,
right?

182
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,780
Or,
or they buy or they create their own

183
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:53,480
streaming platform called Zulu,
right?

184
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,780
So they start Zulu,
they could start to charge netflix more

185
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:03,270
money for using their service.
They could charge more money,

186
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:04,530
they could charge,
you know,

187
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,850
beats more money,
whatever,

188
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,800
so that they have an advantage for their
own streaming services in,

189
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:13,140
in that,
that way they can culturally control

190
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,850
content.
And you know,

191
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,750
you're so right.

192
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,110
And what happens is you as a consumer,
you just get online and you might not

193
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:20,700
even notice,
right?

194
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,840
You might not even notice they're taking
you to the video content that they have

195
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:29,841
a special pay for relationship with.
I think though the biggest harm is to

196
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:31,480
entrepreneurship.
Yeah,

197
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,041
that's right.
Now,

198
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,450
look,
you have a good idea.

199
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:34,770
You got a business,
a service.

200
00:09:34,771 --> 00:09:38,790
You can go online and you can almost
instantly have global reach.

201
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,990
That's amazing,
but now you're going to have to figure

202
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:47,991
out is your broadband provider instead
going to shuffle off all your traffic to

203
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:50,370
someone else who's paying them on the
side?

204
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,330
Are you going to have a fair shot to
show your wares and your ideas to the

205
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:55,090
world?

206
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:59,250
It's harder because I start thinking
like a bad one percenter,

207
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,011
dude,
and I'm like,

208
00:10:00,011 --> 00:10:02,860
all right,
if there's no net neutrality and I'm the

209
00:10:02,861 --> 00:10:06,160
only person that can service Calabasas,
California,

210
00:10:06,161 --> 00:10:07,300
Woodland Hills,
California,

211
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,650
well I'm going to charge all the other
streaming providers more money to use

212
00:10:11,651 --> 00:10:15,370
this and I'm going to create a
competitor and every single one of these

213
00:10:15,371 --> 00:10:19,930
sectors so you can have an advantage.
If you have your show with me and if

214
00:10:19,931 --> 00:10:22,060
you're on the other one,
I'm going to disadvantage you.

215
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:23,260
I'm going to tax you basically.

216
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,440
So right now these are concerns and
there's nothing that's actually

217
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:32,220
happening yet.
Is this.

218
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,990
This ruling was just passed.
That's right.

219
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:39,830
Are there any plans in place for things
that we should be concerned with and is

220
00:10:40,711 --> 00:10:43,860
there anything that we can do about this
current ruling?

221
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,750
Yes,
there's loads because I'm not giving up

222
00:10:47,751 --> 00:10:50,600
and the fight for net neutrality and I
don't want you to either.

223
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,790
We got a few different pathways ahead.
First in Congress right now,

224
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,670
they are trying to get rid of what just
happened at the FCC.

225
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:06,140
They're trying to use this law called
the Congressional Review Act that an

226
00:11:06,141 --> 00:11:09,260
effect just undid everything that the
FCC just did.

227
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:14,330
So it's a way to wipe out what just
happened and while the odds are long,

228
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:19,220
there's more than 40 United States
senators who have sponsored that law and

229
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:23,120
in the house side there's more than 80
members of the House of Representatives.

230
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:28,070
So there's momentum growing in Congress
to take a look at this issue and maybe

231
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:31,190
fixed what the FCC did,
and if you're sitting out there and

232
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,970
thinking they're not listening to you,
we should do something totally old

233
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:36,800
fashioned.
You should pick up the phone,

234
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,070
call your members of Congress and your
representatives and let them know you

235
00:11:40,071 --> 00:11:44,600
care about this issue because that still
today is one of the most powerful ways

236
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,270
of conveying your opinion to those who
represent you.

237
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,630
When is the vote happening on that?
It is not yet scheduled.

238
00:11:50,631 --> 00:11:54,970
I think it's going to happen first in
the United States Senate and later in

239
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:58,720
the house.
I also think we are going to have

240
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,320
litigation.
We've already got a few states attorneys

241
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,210
general who want a sued to overturn
this.

242
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:06,850
We've got some big companies and public
interest groups,

243
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:12,010
so I think it's fair to say we're going
to court and then we're also seeing

244
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:16,900
activity in state houses and that we've
seen net neutrality legislation

245
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:19,750
introduced in Nebraska,
Nevada,

246
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,970
Washington state,
Massachusetts,

247
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,490
California.
Lots of places,

248
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,100
and I'm not sure how that all comes
together legally,

249
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:29,320
but what you see as this momentum
growing,

250
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,260
that people are not happy with what
Washington just did.

251
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,010
The thing that I'm worried about with
the state's laws.

252
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:36,870
Right,
so just to lay it out for the listeners,

253
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:37,950
right.
There's people will,

254
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,020
will,
the government will pass the federal

255
00:12:40,021 --> 00:12:42,450
law,
but then states have their own rights to

256
00:12:42,451 --> 00:12:46,200
regulate certain things.
Let's say we use marijuana laws as an

257
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:50,700
example because recently a lot of states
past legal marijuana laws,

258
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,060
right?
But then trump gave people the power to

259
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:58,080
enforce federal laws about marijuana
more stringently.

260
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,510
Right?
He was telling the federal government,

261
00:13:00,511 --> 00:13:03,000
Hey,
enforce our federal marijuana laws.

262
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,220
What's really jeff sessions,
right?

263
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,530
Chefs,
yeah,

264
00:13:07,531 --> 00:13:12,330
his goon is doing that,
but so how would federalism work if

265
00:13:12,331 --> 00:13:16,980
states started to pass their own net
neutrality laws versus the the,

266
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,130
the FCC Commissioner Orleans,

267
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,700
yeah.
Those are hard questions.

268
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:22,620
I mean,
they'd go right to the constitution.

269
00:13:22,621 --> 00:13:25,410
What's interstate?
What's within the state's authority,

270
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,060
but I'm just standing back and seeing
really just a lot of energy on this

271
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:32,670
issue.
There's nothing else that I've worked on

272
00:13:32,671 --> 00:13:37,671
in Washington where this immediately
statehouses decided to put pen to paper

273
00:13:38,071 --> 00:13:41,880
and introduce legislation and I think
that that momentum is what's really

274
00:13:41,881 --> 00:13:42,714
exciting here.

275
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,110
Well,
I think everyone understands the insane

276
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:51,111
power of the Internet and what,
what a cultural shift that we've

277
00:13:51,361 --> 00:13:55,110
experienced over the last 20 years.
I mean it's unprecedented in human

278
00:13:55,111 --> 00:13:56,760
history.
There's never been anything like it in

279
00:13:56,761 --> 00:14:00,210
terms of access to information,
in terms of the rate of change,

280
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,210
the way people look at things,
the way the issues get discussed,

281
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,100
the cycle of news,
which is like,

282
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,570
what,
10 hours now?

283
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,160
Stories come in and out.
I mean Hawaii just had a fake missile

284
00:14:11,161 --> 00:14:15,150
attack and everybody already forgot it
already onto the next like what's the

285
00:14:15,151 --> 00:14:17,490
next thing we posted?
Check my phone because I think we have

286
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:21,000
to fix that.
We should certainly happened in Hawaii.

287
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,930
Someone went crazy.

288
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,920
Still learning.
It looks like it was a state level

289
00:14:25,921 --> 00:14:28,080
issue,
but you can't have things like that

290
00:14:28,081 --> 00:14:30,540
happen.
We got to figure out a way in this

291
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:35,541
digital world that we get accurate
information to people faster and we we

292
00:14:35,551 --> 00:14:37,650
got to come up with better systems than
the one we just saw.

293
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,400
You need somebody pressed a button and
send out a text that said that there's

294
00:14:41,401 --> 00:14:45,420
an incoming ballistic missile.
It's a possibility of threat of an

295
00:14:45,421 --> 00:14:47,370
incoming ballistic missile and this is
not a drill.

296
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,610
And then I have friends in Hawaii and
everyone went crazy.

297
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,880
People were crying in the streets,
no one knew what to do.

298
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,430
And of course this is a state that was
attacked,

299
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,310
you know,
less than 100 years ago during World War

300
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,950
Two.
So this is not an unusual thing for

301
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:01,220
them.

302
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,050
Yeah.
I had the privilege of working for

303
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:06,680
senator in a way from Hawaii years ago
and I think Hawaiians are,

304
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,510
you know,
they're graceful.

305
00:15:08,511 --> 00:15:11,390
They're resilient,
but they live with the knowledge that

306
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:15,740
they are susceptible to some attack.
So this gave them 40 minutes,

307
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,670
40 minutes of their life.
And the amazing thing to me is it took

308
00:15:19,671 --> 00:15:23,000
like 10 minutes or so for this to be
corrected on twitter.

309
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,750
Took,
took off another half hour for our

310
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:30,290
official systems to update and say,
in fact this was a mistake.

311
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,580
Yeah.
Once we found out,

312
00:15:31,581 --> 00:15:33,740
figure that out,
let that happen.

313
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,050
Yeah.
But then once I figured out it was a

314
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:36,801
mistake,
I was like,

315
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:39,050
Whoa,
maybe I should ask Jessica if we could

316
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:42,050
send like a national message on my
birthday.

317
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:43,190
12 am,
March first,

318
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:46,940
and be like,
you up just a nationwide booty call.

319
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,970
The FCC will not be helping in that
regard.

320
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,140
I had to ask.
That's a big question,

321
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,580
but what Joe was saying about the
Internet and how it opened things up

322
00:15:58,581 --> 00:16:02,060
like personally for me,
like today's Martin Luther King Jr Day.

323
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,170
Right.
And uh,

324
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,650
I remember reading letter from
Birmingham jail as a kid,

325
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:10,590
Johnathan swift,
modest proposal as a kid and Tupac a me

326
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,160
against world.
Those were like the three works that

327
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:17,180
made me want to write.
And I started writing since I was 15

328
00:16:17,181 --> 00:16:18,590
years old.
Never gave up,

329
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,930
but no one would buy my writing.
Right.

330
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:24,770
The only place that would by my writing
was roto wire and I would write fantasy

331
00:16:24,771 --> 00:16:27,650
sports updates for them.
I covered the magic and I covered the

332
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:30,980
knicks,
but all the way until I was like 28

333
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:33,560
years old,
no one wanted to buy my writing.

334
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:38,590
It was blog spot that it allowed me to
write in my own voice and find my own

335
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:41,690
audience and then people started to see,
whoa,

336
00:16:41,691 --> 00:16:45,950
there are like weird children on the
Internet that like Eddie's writing,

337
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:50,140
like he's creating a lane and I talked
to my publisher at Random House and they

338
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:50,571
were like,
yeah,

339
00:16:50,571 --> 00:16:53,510
you created a lane selling books to
people who don't buy books,

340
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,600
non traditional readers,
and so without the Internet,

341
00:16:56,601 --> 00:16:59,960
without blogspot,
without that ability to just project my

342
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:02,810
voice and hope someone connects like I
never would have happened.

343
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,730
I know we're living through it in real
time,

344
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:09,020
but it is totally radical as a matter of
human history that you can reach out,

345
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,610
reach around the world and build
community with total disregard for

346
00:17:13,611 --> 00:17:18,611
geography and find people who like
fantasy sports or something like that

347
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,380
and and build community around it.
That's an extraordinary thing and it has

348
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:27,110
no precedent in human culture

349
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,590
and with translation software.
Now language is no longer even a

350
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,590
barrier.
I mean it's changing and shifting as as

351
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:36,050
we speak,
new technologies are being developed.

352
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,460
I mean Samsung has a phone now that that
note eight where you could just

353
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:42,620
highlight something and instantly
translated.

354
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:47,810
I mean they have earbuds where you could
put that on the pixel where if you talk

355
00:17:47,811 --> 00:17:50,310
to me in Spanish,
I'll hear it in English and this is

356
00:17:50,311 --> 00:17:52,480
crazy stuff and this is all changed.

357
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,300
That does for commerce or diplomacy or
your ability to talk to me across the

358
00:17:57,301 --> 00:18:00,990
table without having a translator in
some clunky way.

359
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:05,370
Try to describe what I just said.
These things are amazing and you want

360
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:10,530
all of our collective genius to drive
them and not have big Cape gatekeepers

361
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:12,120
like our broadband providers in the way.

362
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,840
Yeah.
It seems to be a real issue and I think

363
00:18:14,841 --> 00:18:19,820
that we should look at the internet as
something different than almost all

364
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,540
other services because it is our
ability.

365
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,230
It directly affects our ability to
evolve as a culture,

366
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,260
our ability to exchange information.
It's,

367
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:35,380
it's so critical and it's,
it's so unprecedented and this is a very

368
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,080
powerful thing and you know,
people would love to have it go back to

369
00:18:40,081 --> 00:18:44,330
the old way and have you get your news
on ABC and NBC and CBS and that's it.

370
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,250
People would love that because they
control you.

371
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:47,300
Sure.
I mean,

372
00:18:47,301 --> 00:18:49,490
it would be way easier to keep the
world,

373
00:18:49,491 --> 00:18:51,680
you know,
informed in the way that they would

374
00:18:51,681 --> 00:18:52,650
like.
Yeah,

375
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,610
it will be easier for regulators in
Washington too.

376
00:18:55,611 --> 00:18:57,950
I mean,
there's just disorderly chaos on the

377
00:18:57,951 --> 00:18:59,450
internet,
but it,

378
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,350
it,
um,

379
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,280
it create it.
Listen,

380
00:19:01,281 --> 00:19:05,360
it has challenges,
but it's unearthed communities and

381
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:10,190
created economic possibility for people
like nothing in our history.

382
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,113
Yeah.
I think it just,

383
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,810
it's changing who humans are,
you know,

384
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,610
I think there's more of an understanding
of each other.

385
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,430
There's more,
there's more compassion.

386
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,020
I mean,
there's also a lot of hate and there's a

387
00:19:21,021 --> 00:19:26,021
lot of anger and there's a lot of.
But I think with the bad there's more

388
00:19:26,751 --> 00:19:29,960
good yet undoubtedly there's much more
good.

389
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:32,900
And to me it feels like a freedom of
speech issue,

390
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,670
you know,
like it's if,

391
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:39,290
if this internet kind of super highways
controlled and there's toll booths

392
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,110
everywhere and it gets privatized.
Like,

393
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,380
I mean,
I lived in Florida,

394
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,320
we didn't have money for roads.
I saw when things got privatized,

395
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,470
it's you just pay more,
you don't have the same service.

396
00:19:48,471 --> 00:19:50,480
It's,
it's one of those things like it has to

397
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:53,240
be regulated,
it has to be protected and it has to be

398
00:19:53,241 --> 00:19:55,910
guaranteed as a thing for all human
beings.

399
00:19:55,911 --> 00:19:57,470
Not even just Americans.
Well,

400
00:19:57,471 --> 00:20:00,350
it's just,
it's stunning to me how many people are

401
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,650
against the idea of having an open
internet.

402
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,293
It's just,

403
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,201
well,
you know,

404
00:20:06,201 --> 00:20:08,690
most of the polling,
I think polls are always,

405
00:20:08,691 --> 00:20:09,650
you got to be careful,
right?

406
00:20:09,651 --> 00:20:12,110
Because they can ask a question one way
and get an answer.

407
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:16,250
But the best one done was right before
our boat by the University of Maryland.

408
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,960
80 three percent of the public supported
net neutrality opposed what we were

409
00:20:20,961 --> 00:20:21,670
doing.

410
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,730
But who are those 17 percent dummies?
That's what I want to know.

411
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,970
I think anything you can get the
American public to agree to at 83

412
00:20:27,971 --> 00:20:30,130
percent is a pretty high.
I think it's wonderful,

413
00:20:30,131 --> 00:20:34,420
but I'm stunned to meet the 17 percent
seriously,

414
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,090
but isn't there a bunch of people?
I feel like there's some,

415
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,970
and I.
I wrote about this on twitter recently

416
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:43,840
without judgment.
I said that net neutrality seems to me

417
00:20:43,841 --> 00:20:48,730
to be one of those ideological issues
where if you're on the right,

418
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:53,910
you support it or if you're on the left,
rather you support it where you're on

419
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:55,930
the right,
you would like to go away.

420
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,310
It's almost like totally

421
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,970
okay.
Can you give you are a Democrat or

422
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:03,070
Republican?
You benefit from net neutrality and

423
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:05,830
internet openness.
If you're conservative or liberal,

424
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,720
if you're a big business or a small
business,

425
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:12,721
you benefit from Internet openness and
the history of net neutrality is

426
00:21:13,361 --> 00:21:15,130
something that doesn't get discussed
enough,

427
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:20,670
which is that it began the first time
the FCC put net neutrality policy on

428
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:24,580
paper.
It was 2005 and I'm old enough to

429
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:28,060
remember that that was when President
George W dot Bush was in the White

430
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,080
House.
In other words,

431
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,760
this country's first net neutrality
policies were put on paper.

432
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:39,270
One of republican was running the FCC.
It is only in recent days.

433
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:42,730
We have characterized this as a left
right issue and I think that's a

434
00:21:42,731 --> 00:21:45,400
fundamentally a mistake.
How did it happen?

435
00:21:45,401 --> 00:21:50,401
Like when when object Pi proposed this
legislation and passed it,

436
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,670
it baffled me.
I thought net neutrality was a thing we

437
00:21:54,671 --> 00:21:55,480
had all agreed on.

438
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,980
It was like,
we're never touching this.

439
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,740
How did this happen?
Well,

440
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,660
you know,
through a whole bunch of boring

441
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:05,430
Washington procedures whereby they
circulate our proposed rulemaking.

442
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,680
How did,
how did he get the power and leverage to

443
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:13,681
pass this?
I think that he was supported by people

444
00:22:13,931 --> 00:22:17,200
in Washington,
including some broadband providers and

445
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:22,120
was led to believe that with
deregulation we would all be better off.

446
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:24,970
And then what?
What?

447
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,000
What I find interesting is Google,
Amazon,

448
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:29,140
facebook,
these,

449
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,340
these big power players used to be very
vocal net neutrality,

450
00:22:33,341 --> 00:22:35,170
keep the internet free,
things like that.

451
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,030
They're not as loud as they used to be.
They seem to just be quiet on it.

452
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,460
What do you think is going on there?
Well,

453
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:45,940
first I want to point out that those big
companies through their association are

454
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,600
gonna be intervening in the lawsuits in
favor of net neutrality.

455
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,710
Yeah,
so that's true.

456
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,020
Yeah.
But to me net neutrality has never

457
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:57,040
really been about big companies.
It's about who's going to be the next

458
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,550
digital platform,
who's going to be the next startup and

459
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:03,790
the next player.
I'm the big companies can always find

460
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:08,791
ways to build relationships and manage
this kind of lack of neutrality online

461
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,860
with their leverage that come from size.
It's.

462
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,610
It's a question of who's going to start
something up that you and I may not see

463
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,040
because they didn't pay off their
broadband provider.

464
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,630
It's the entrepreneurship that has me
most concerned likes new small business.

465
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,850
Yeah,
so when I was saying that there's a.

466
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,880
seems like an ideological rift.
There's certain people that are not very

467
00:23:29,881 --> 00:23:33,000
well versed in this issue,
that automatically side one way or

468
00:23:33,001 --> 00:23:35,160
another.
This is a thing that we do in this

469
00:23:35,161 --> 00:23:36,270
country culturally,
right?

470
00:23:36,271 --> 00:23:38,940
Left thing.
You see it a lot with global warming.

471
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,230
Will you have a conversation with
people?

472
00:23:40,231 --> 00:23:42,590
They say that global warming's,
so natural process,

473
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:46,880
natural cycle of the earth goes through
it and he talked to them about how much

474
00:23:46,881 --> 00:23:51,320
research they've done on it.
It's almost none if they fall into these

475
00:23:51,321 --> 00:23:56,060
ideological groups and those pull
yourself up by your bootstraps,

476
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,250
right wing,
you know,

477
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,490
there's this sort of conservative way of
thinking that the let the market decide

478
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,200
and this is that,
that conversation.

479
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,930
I don't think that's an honest
conversation if you're dealing with

480
00:24:05,931 --> 00:24:08,330
monopolies in,
in regards to Internet access,

481
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,300
which I think a lot of and I am and you
are,

482
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,360
a lot of people are.
It's a giant part of living in America.

483
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,440
Yeah.
And that tribalism that you're

484
00:24:16,441 --> 00:24:19,620
describing right now,
it's really deteriorating the quality of

485
00:24:19,621 --> 00:24:23,250
our dialogue in Washington.
We've got to find a way to fix it

486
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,533
because,
um,

487
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:29,580
we're not going to move ahead without
actually having some back and forth on

488
00:24:29,581 --> 00:24:30,160
these things.

489
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,840
This is like the one issue where I'm
like,

490
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,400
it actually brings people together.
80 three percent of people support it.

491
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,253
Percent.
Yeah.

492
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,350
It's undeniable.
But it.

493
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,360
That's what's scary about this country
now,

494
00:24:40,361 --> 00:24:43,120
is that even when so many of us agree
about something,

495
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,120
when one very powerful group,
a lobby,

496
00:24:46,121 --> 00:24:49,490
the broadband companies get behind
somebody with some control,

497
00:24:49,491 --> 00:24:51,790
like they can push the needle.
You know,

498
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:52,780
it's funny if you am I

499
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:57,370
email inbox,
which was an explosive thing leading up

500
00:24:57,371 --> 00:25:02,371
to this vote was full of people writing
and telling me their stories,

501
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:05,250
but a whole bunch of that more like,
you know,

502
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,710
I'm a registered Republican but I want
you to know,

503
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:12,730
or I supported the president,
but I believe net neutrality is really

504
00:25:12,731 --> 00:25:15,580
important.
It was striking to me like once you get

505
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:18,820
out of the talking head types.
Yeah,

506
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,680
she found is that there was really broad
based support for net neutrality.

507
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,140
Well,
what's stunning about this

508
00:25:26,141 --> 00:25:30,280
administration is how trump's
administration is just going ham for

509
00:25:30,281 --> 00:25:33,250
business.
They are going ham for offshore

510
00:25:33,251 --> 00:25:37,090
drilling.
They're going ham for diminishing state

511
00:25:37,091 --> 00:25:40,540
parks and starting to tap into
resources,

512
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:42,970
whether it's mining or fracking or
keynotes.

513
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:45,430
The world's gonna end in 25 years or
something and he's like,

514
00:25:45,431 --> 00:25:46,870
just go.
Just take it all.

515
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,120
Here's the thing.
He doesn't have 25 years.

516
00:25:49,121 --> 00:25:51,310
Yeah,
and so the world is gonna end in 25

517
00:25:51,311 --> 00:25:52,150
years.
I mean,

518
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:55,210
if you're a 72 year old guy,
how much time do you have left?

519
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,480
If you have 25 years,
those last 25 years,

520
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,830
you're,
you know,

521
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,693
you're barely there.

522
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,660
Yeah,
it's insane.

523
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,240
There's nothing going to be left after
this administration.

524
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,890
Well,
it's real weird.

525
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,860
It's because it lets you know,
like people used to think,

526
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:11,090
wow,
the president is that much power.

527
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,690
Look at what's happening.
Yeah.

528
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,820
There's,
there's a,

529
00:26:13,821 --> 00:26:18,800
a giant shift in environmental policies.
Environmental Protection Agency has been

530
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:22,910
gutted is that's the scary stuff.
The scary stuff is how much emphasis is

531
00:26:22,911 --> 00:26:26,960
placed on business and how little on the
world in which we live.

532
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,640
I mean,
we have to balance that out.

533
00:26:28,641 --> 00:26:28,930
It's also

534
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:31,540
how we got to focus on the future,
right?

535
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:34,750
Yes.
It is not a given that we're going to

536
00:26:34,751 --> 00:26:38,680
succeed in everything.
If we don't start planning and when I

537
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:40,900
think about the world my kids are going
to inherit,

538
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:44,430
it's going to be digital.
They're going to be consequences.

539
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,640
Why don't we start doing something about
that right now?

540
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:53,220
There's not a lot of urgency.
It's one of the weirdest parts of being

541
00:26:53,221 --> 00:26:57,690
a person as people look so short term
and they always feel like someone's

542
00:26:57,691 --> 00:26:59,490
gonna fix it.
You know?

543
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,331
I mean,
isn't that the,

544
00:27:00,331 --> 00:27:02,490
the attitudes som was going to fix
bulger right now.

545
00:27:02,491 --> 00:27:05,040
The economy's booming.
Java's test is at all time low and

546
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,960
they'll just start throwing all the good
stuff your way.

547
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:07,771
But yeah.
Well,

548
00:27:07,771 --> 00:27:10,740
when you just start raping the
environment and the business has go,

549
00:27:10,741 --> 00:27:11,790
hey,
as a lot of process,

550
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,220
a profit to be made here,
let's,

551
00:27:14,221 --> 00:27:15,390
uh,
let's get going.

552
00:27:15,391 --> 00:27:16,960
Let's start hiring some people.
Yeah.

553
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,910
It's like all the money goes to defense
and Department of Education is good at

554
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:23,730
department of Energy has gutted
department of Environment's all these

555
00:27:23,731 --> 00:27:26,340
things are gutted.
Everything that has to do with art,

556
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,780
even present and future,
it's good at the,

557
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:32,280
the only thing that's going on in his
business and defense.

558
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:35,160
And what's the argument for that?
The argument for that is that as

559
00:27:35,161 --> 00:27:38,340
business booms,
as the economy will be trickled down and

560
00:27:38,341 --> 00:27:43,170
they'll be more opportunities for
businesses to clean up the environment

561
00:27:43,171 --> 00:27:46,500
and profit off of it and yeah,
but it's never work.

562
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,660
Commissioner,
can you like trickle down?

563
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:51,330
Economics has never worked in the
history of the history.

564
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,460
I have my doubts about it.
Yeah.

565
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,720
Yeah.
I've heard every pro and con for it.

566
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,010
It's it,
it.

567
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:02,520
I think at the very least the trump
administration and I'm trying to look at

568
00:28:02,521 --> 00:28:07,521
it through rose colored glasses is a
fascinating experiment and in so many

569
00:28:07,531 --> 00:28:12,060
different ways,
but it's also I think made us all more

570
00:28:12,061 --> 00:28:14,880
conscious of our role as citizens.
Yes.

571
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,960
People have to talk back to Washington.
They have to speak up.

572
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:24,330
We need our representatives to hear what
people think and I think we got a little

573
00:28:24,331 --> 00:28:25,260
comfortable there.

574
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,080
Believe in the system just runs by
itself,

575
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,790
but it does better when people
participate and I think that there's a

576
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:36,330
lot more demanded of us now as citizens
no matter where you fall on the

577
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:40,410
political spectrum.
I think it woke us all up to that fact.

578
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,260
Besides just calling state reps,
senators,

579
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:46,340
what else can people do?
Um,

580
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,930
uh,
participate in letter writing campaigns,

581
00:28:48,931 --> 00:28:51,570
get things in your editorial page,
you know,

582
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:56,280
I don't mean a big papers.
I wrote something for the La Times about

583
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:57,840
this awhile ago,
but um,

584
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,270
I mean in your,
your local papers,

585
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:04,380
tell them why it's important.
Tell them how you built a business using

586
00:29:04,381 --> 00:29:09,270
online activities and how maybe going
forward that's going to be a little

587
00:29:09,271 --> 00:29:13,050
harder.
I think I'm making efforts to make sure

588
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:17,010
that people understand this at a local
level is really powerful.

589
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,630
What's very disturbing to people that
320 million people can view how many we

590
00:29:21,631 --> 00:29:23,070
have 3:20,
somewhere in there that,

591
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:27,060
that can be affected by five people.
It's crazy,

592
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:28,080
right?
It's insane.

593
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:33,170
Five unelected bureaucrats because look,
that's who we are.

594
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:38,560
Have this extraordinary power over what
we can watch.

595
00:29:38,561 --> 00:29:40,680
So he hear and learn.

596
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:46,510
I think that um,
there's something in that that strikes

597
00:29:46,511 --> 00:29:48,910
me is not right.
And the idea that in the end,

598
00:29:48,911 --> 00:29:52,750
just three of them voted to roll back
this open.

599
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:57,000
So three people changed it for $320
million people.

600
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,540
That's crazy.
That doesn't seem like the end three

601
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:02,130
people by the way,
who were not voted in.

602
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,730
So they're unelected,
which was bananas.

603
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,140
I mean,
there's no question about it.

604
00:30:07,141 --> 00:30:09,930
That's a terrible idea.
Like if you gave people the option,

605
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:10,770
he said,
hey,

606
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:15,770
do you think that five people should be
able to decide whether or not the 320

607
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:18,060
million plus plus the rest of the world
really?

608
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,850
Because if you're a super podcast gets
cut off,

609
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,700
you know,
you're not gonna be able to reach the

610
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,260
Canada either.
Who Do you think that they should be

611
00:30:25,261 --> 00:30:29,760
able to stop access to?
Information people define slide

612
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,410
83 percent of the American public to
it's.

613
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,100
It's insane and that's the type of shit
that makes me feel trapped in this

614
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:38,470
country sometimes because we did an
elect these people,

615
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,630
you know?
Yeah.

616
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:43,930
I think.
I think you gotta make a choice which is

617
00:30:43,931 --> 00:30:48,040
you got to choose to be optimistic
because it's the only force multiplier

618
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:50,740
we have,
which is you're going to decide that if

619
00:30:50,741 --> 00:30:53,380
something's not right,
you're going to call,

620
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,740
you're going to write letters,
you're going to write editorials that

621
00:30:55,741 --> 00:31:00,741
you're to build campaigns around things
because in the end that's the only way

622
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:04,390
to change things and if all of us felt a
little of that spirit,

623
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,380
Gosh,
today,

624
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,970
if not every day,
I think that that would make

625
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,250
extraordinary difference and we're
already seeing its impact in Washington.

626
00:31:12,251 --> 00:31:17,251
There are more people showing up in the
capital city for votes for marches.

627
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:21,580
There are more people reaching out to
their members of Congress than ever

628
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:25,360
before and I just think we're going to
have to sustain that energy if we want

629
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:28,600
to create some real change.
I think it's about more people who have

630
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:32,800
an opinion of values that are
trustworthy in the community running.

631
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,250
I think more people need to run because
for awhile we've.

632
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,770
I've actually looked at government as
something like I may be,

633
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:41,590
could never be part of.
This is a totally different thing,

634
00:31:41,591 --> 00:31:42,900
like I just,
I,

635
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:45,160
I researched the candidates and I go
vote and that's,

636
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:49,150
that's my interaction with it,
but I'm starting to realize that even if

637
00:31:49,151 --> 00:31:51,810
you don't want to run or even if you
want to run it,

638
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:56,850
it's a possibility and you number one,
you can encourage your other friends to

639
00:31:57,761 --> 00:32:01,180
go run and you can look at who is trying
to start campaigns.

640
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:04,510
Like I'm 35 now and,
and Dara friends from law school.

641
00:32:04,511 --> 00:32:05,560
Then they're like,
hey,

642
00:32:05,561 --> 00:32:07,000
I'm thinking about running,
you know,

643
00:32:07,001 --> 00:32:09,460
like I want to throw a fundraiser,
who should I speak to?

644
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:12,220
And then you know,
there's a guy that I played basketball

645
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,390
within a basketball league.
He was like,

646
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:15,370
I'm going to try to run for governor of
California.

647
00:32:15,371 --> 00:32:16,600
I'm like,
good luck,

648
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:20,890
but like I'm going to follow what you're
doing and I think more people need to

649
00:32:20,891 --> 00:32:22,240
run.
But if you're not running,

650
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,700
hold the people that are running
responsible,

651
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:28,870
ask the difficult questions like be a
part of the kind of vetting of that

652
00:32:28,871 --> 00:32:33,070
candidate and be hands on in the process
of that person's candidacy.

653
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,290
Are you running for president with
Oprah?

654
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,193
No,
no,

655
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,200
no.
I'm not running mind.

656
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,083
Thing is,
is that,

657
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,920
you know,
I think we all need to have a stake in

658
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:46,880
the cats that are running in and ask the
questions that need to be asked because

659
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,620
you know,
I've been one of the people that just

660
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:51,380
shows up maybe two weeks before the
election,

661
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,790
two weeks before the deadline of like
the,

662
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,860
the absentee ballot and I go research
for two weeks and I go check out all the

663
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,550
pros and cons of each candidate and
after two weeks I decide,

664
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:04,820
but you know,
I should be involved more than that.

665
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,490
I said as it announce your congressional
run right here.

666
00:33:07,491 --> 00:33:09,770
Right now.
I'm too busy.

667
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,230
I'm too busy.
This is not the problem though.

668
00:33:12,231 --> 00:33:15,140
The people that we would want to run for
president or whatever,

669
00:33:15,141 --> 00:33:17,210
elected official oftentimes are too
busy.

670
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,950
I mean,
I think if you ran.

671
00:33:18,951 --> 00:33:22,100
I mean I'm not really clean up.
You could really do it.

672
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,730
I'm not running.
You got a bigger platform than I do.

673
00:33:23,731 --> 00:33:25,700
I'm interested in.
I just,

674
00:33:25,701 --> 00:33:30,020
I don't see important though.
You find a way to participate in public

675
00:33:30,021 --> 00:33:34,760
life and give back whether you run or
support someone or encourage your

676
00:33:34,761 --> 00:33:38,000
friends and they don't have to be the
person who was the student council

677
00:33:38,001 --> 00:33:41,240
president in high school.
Muslim people out there.

678
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,640
My thing with candidates say,
great,

679
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,660
so joe,
we've had disagreements on the show.

680
00:33:44,661 --> 00:33:46,730
We disagree about certain things.
We just screwed up.

681
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,840
Well,
it was a.

682
00:33:47,841 --> 00:33:50,820
It was the minimum.
A university changed my mind based.

683
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,810
By the way I changed.
There was a knee jerk reaction to you.

684
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,500
We've talked about this.
I was talking about universal basic

685
00:33:57,501 --> 00:34:01,530
income and net neutrality was sorta
nerdy,

686
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,490
nerdy about ubi.
I think you

687
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,190
automatically,
knee jerk goes,

688
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,200
ah,
don't do that.

689
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,970
It's bad for human nature.

690
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:12,770
You give people money,
they get lazy,

691
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:13,910
but then I thought about.
I said,

692
00:34:13,911 --> 00:34:15,350
no,
you're just giving them food and

693
00:34:15,351 --> 00:34:17,840
shelter.
You give people food and shelter.

694
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:21,410
You're still leaving open ambition and
you're also freeing them up for the

695
00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:26,210
possibility of perhaps exploring things
that they would really truly love to do

696
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:28,580
where they have,
and I think when we,

697
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,220
when we started dealing with automated
vehicles,

698
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:35,690
automated trucks and trucking and
shipping and driving is a giant

699
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,870
business.
It's a huge part of what people have to

700
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,690
like.
There's some extraordinary percentage of

701
00:34:41,691 --> 00:34:46,400
men who drive for a living and if you
eliminate that,

702
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:47,780
you're going to have a lot of people out
of work.

703
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:49,670
You have.
We have automation that's coming to

704
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,140
factories and all these different
places.

705
00:34:51,141 --> 00:34:54,680
It's going to eliminate the need for
humans cut out all the human error or

706
00:34:54,681 --> 00:34:57,410
what are we going to do with all those
people and what are we gonna do with all

707
00:34:57,411 --> 00:35:02,160
those jobs and how do you give these
people this newfound possibility,

708
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:02,810
this,
this,

709
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:07,760
this avenue for exploring new potential
career paths.

710
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:11,630
What will the best way is have their
money taken care of in terms of like

711
00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:14,810
food and shelter,
like have given them the freedom to

712
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:15,950
explore ideas?
Yeah,

713
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,910
because it's a benefit a lot of people
have and then they do work and you take

714
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:23,600
that stress off their plate,
but I talked about the conversation

715
00:35:23,601 --> 00:35:26,090
because we had it.
We had a good discussion about it and

716
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:29,780
then it went on for weeks on twitter.
We kept talking and then we both kind of

717
00:35:29,781 --> 00:35:32,090
came around on on things and I was like,
Yo,

718
00:35:32,091 --> 00:35:34,580
this is great and when I think about
candidates,

719
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:38,220
I think about I would vote for somebody
who they're

720
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,630
going to stick to their guns and they're
gonna do what they said they would and

721
00:35:42,631 --> 00:35:45,060
their values aren't going to change once
they go to DC.

722
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:46,550
That's all you can ask for from a
person.

723
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:50,130
Be honest about who you are and be who
you are when you go to DC,

724
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,720
future of civilization,
right?

725
00:35:53,721 --> 00:35:58,190
Like where are we now and where this
insane change that we've experienced

726
00:35:58,191 --> 00:35:59,780
over the last 20 years because of the
Internet.

727
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,760
What is,
what is it going to be like in 20 years

728
00:36:01,761 --> 00:36:05,600
from now?
And what happens to the average person,

729
00:36:05,601 --> 00:36:09,080
the average human being.
We have this idea that you're supposed

730
00:36:09,081 --> 00:36:13,020
to show up nine to five for a job and
that's what you do and then you work

731
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:16,310
until you're retired,
but that's all something that people

732
00:36:16,311 --> 00:36:18,170
invented.
I mean there's all of.

733
00:36:18,171 --> 00:36:20,510
This is a new thing in terms of human
history.

734
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:25,750
This is not the only way human beings
can live and the idea that this is the

735
00:36:25,821 --> 00:36:30,821
only way to use our tax money or
resources is the way we're doing it

736
00:36:30,921 --> 00:36:33,620
currently.
That doesn't seem to be that logical and

737
00:36:33,621 --> 00:36:38,270
I would like people to have more
opportunity to innovate and create and

738
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:41,180
more freedom where they don't feel
shackled down.

739
00:36:41,181 --> 00:36:44,450
Like there's a lot of people out there
that just feel shackled down by just the

740
00:36:44,451 --> 00:36:47,840
need to feed themselves and survive.

741
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,810
Yeah.
And also just even school,

742
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,990
like I started reading and listening to
these podcasts about sleep.

743
00:36:52,991 --> 00:36:53,824
Right.
And it's a.

744
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:57,010
it's a scientific thing.
Some people are not morning people.

745
00:36:57,011 --> 00:37:01,480
She's laughing,
but like reading or listening to

746
00:37:01,481 --> 00:37:03,520
podcasts about sleep,
you will.

747
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:07,820
You could get information at Somnia
listening to pat.

748
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,350
No,
but I listened to this dude and he was

749
00:37:11,351 --> 00:37:13,310
talking about like it's a scientific
thing.

750
00:37:13,311 --> 00:37:15,460
Some people are on a different body
rhythm,

751
00:37:15,461 --> 00:37:18,790
they just don't do well in the morning
and he looked at schools in the school

752
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:21,670
schedule and the school schedule is
based on mom and dad's.

753
00:37:21,671 --> 00:37:25,150
They have a nine to five based on
traffic and let's try to get these kids

754
00:37:25,151 --> 00:37:26,870
into school for high school.
The earliest.

755
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:30,700
Then middle school later than elementary
school after that and some people

756
00:37:30,701 --> 00:37:34,510
because they're morning people did just
suck at such a disadvantage and

757
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,520
highschool,
college.

758
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,460
This is like kind of an educational
industrial complex.

759
00:37:39,461 --> 00:37:42,340
If you don't fit in,
if you're not cookie cutter and the way

760
00:37:42,341 --> 00:37:45,440
your body and your mind works,
you're not going to be successful.

761
00:37:45,441 --> 00:37:50,441
And and speaking of what Joe's talking
about is I think I genuinely believe

762
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,200
like even some of the silliest people
I've met,

763
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:58,000
everybody has some sort of genius it.
We're just not like fostering the

764
00:37:58,001 --> 00:38:00,040
unearthing of that and like,
look,

765
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:02,740
there's some.
There's some hilarious stuff that

766
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:06,460
happens at Bauhaus at the restaurant,
but I tell myself every time I'm like,

767
00:38:06,461 --> 00:38:08,830
all right,
like this guy totally messed up making

768
00:38:08,831 --> 00:38:10,840
this bow.
This guy totally messed up.

769
00:38:10,841 --> 00:38:14,230
Butchering this chicken blake.
Find a place where he can succeed,

770
00:38:14,231 --> 00:38:17,470
like put him in a position to win and
that's a lot of responsibility.

771
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,350
It's a lot of responsibility.
It doesn't always work out,

772
00:38:20,351 --> 00:38:22,060
but.
But usually it does.

773
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,860
Usually you find out like,
you know what?

774
00:38:23,861 --> 00:38:25,660
That guy's really good at making the
sauce,

775
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:26,890
you know,
like put them on the sauce.

776
00:38:26,891 --> 00:38:29,740
Like you have to find a place where
people to be successful,

777
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:33,010
but our society have to find their own
funding.

778
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,890
Yeah.
The problem is if you do have a nine to

779
00:38:35,891 --> 00:38:38,680
five job and you're trying to feed
yourself and get along,

780
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:41,440
you're going to have less chances to
innovate.

781
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:45,620
You're going to left,
left chances to take risky decisions and

782
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,870
just try things out.

783
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,170
That is why Internet openness is so
important though,

784
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:54,910
because this was a platform and a space
for you to go experiment,

785
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,730
build community,
find communities,

786
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,460
figure out what your genius might
involve,

787
00:39:00,461 --> 00:39:02,620
which may not be what you're doing at
work every day.

788
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:09,060
And I think the idea that Washington is
mucking around with that is just crazy.

789
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,980
Well,
I definitely don't think they liked the

790
00:39:11,981 --> 00:39:15,490
fact that people have this ability.
I definitely think if you could,

791
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,060
if the people who created the Internet
knew what they were doing when they

792
00:39:19,061 --> 00:39:22,990
release this on the general public,
they probably wouldn't have liked to

793
00:39:22,991 --> 00:39:26,710
give people the kind of access to
information and the ability to change

794
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:28,960
things.
What we've seen through Arab spring,

795
00:39:28,961 --> 00:39:33,730
we've seen through so many different
cultures that are using this to change

796
00:39:33,731 --> 00:39:35,810
the way they interact with each other.
You know,

797
00:39:35,811 --> 00:39:38,380
it was interesting during our net
neutrality proceeding,

798
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,490
Tim Berners Lee,
who um,

799
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,860
uh,
invented the web and vint cerf who

800
00:39:44,861 --> 00:39:49,750
invented the Internet along with some
real icons from early days like Mitchell

801
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,840
Baker from Mozilla all wrote us and
said,

802
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:57,340
do not change these rules.
And it seems like when you've got that

803
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:01,600
incredible genius of these people who
created this connected world for you and

804
00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:05,260
told you that this agency in Washington,
it's going to really mess around with

805
00:40:05,261 --> 00:40:06,880
it.
It strikes me that,

806
00:40:06,881 --> 00:40:08,140
um,
we should have listened.

807
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,410
Well,
we definitely should have listened,

808
00:40:09,411 --> 00:40:12,710
but we also shouldn't have this place
where five people get to make this

809
00:40:12,711 --> 00:40:14,390
decision.
It's insane.

810
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,980
Yeah.
Going in what you just said,

811
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:17,780
Joe,
it's like even even like,

812
00:40:17,781 --> 00:40:18,940
let's say my role at,
at,

813
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,760
just to explain it from my role as the
owner or manager at the restaurant is

814
00:40:22,761 --> 00:40:27,650
not necessarily always my job to create
a role for somebody in find a way for

815
00:40:27,651 --> 00:40:30,110
them to be successful in my restaurant.
I'm hiring a cook,

816
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:32,780
I'm hiring a manager.
Like this is the job description.

817
00:40:32,781 --> 00:40:34,940
Hopefully if you're coming for this job,
you can do this.

818
00:40:34,941 --> 00:40:38,650
Right?
And I think what you said really opened

819
00:40:38,651 --> 00:40:41,810
some in my mind,
which is the government should not be

820
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,510
always prescriptive about like,
all right,

821
00:40:44,511 --> 00:40:47,240
we're all going to go to school at 7:00.
You're going to study hard and you're

822
00:40:47,241 --> 00:40:48,980
going to get these grades.
You're going to go to college,

823
00:40:48,981 --> 00:40:51,500
like that's not a path to success for
everybody,

824
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:56,710
but what it should do is enable people
to be creative and find out what works

825
00:40:56,991 --> 00:40:59,600
for them.
We need to give people the freedom to

826
00:40:59,601 --> 00:41:00,920
contribute to society.

827
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:02,900
Well,
I think we're trying to manage the

828
00:41:02,901 --> 00:41:07,850
masses without looking at the needs and
the ideas of the individual and

829
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:12,940
everybody has their own likes and
dislikes and creative kinks and things

830
00:41:13,761 --> 00:41:18,761
that mean how many people could have
lived a life of misery but got lucky

831
00:41:20,871 --> 00:41:24,410
somewhere along the line and found
something that they love and,

832
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:29,030
and pursued that.
And I think that there's not a whole lot

833
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:34,031
of guidance in that regard,
but what there is on the Internet is

834
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:39,110
examples of other people have done this
and you can connect with those people

835
00:41:39,111 --> 00:41:41,330
and you can.
There's so many communities when it

836
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:43,630
comes to.
I mean to.

837
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:44,750
I'm not,
I'm don't.

838
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:46,960
I'm weird about stuff.
I,

839
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:50,520
uh,
I liked knifemaking make knives.

840
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,980
It's kind of ominous,
but.

841
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:52,621
No,
no,

842
00:41:52,621 --> 00:41:53,440
no,
no.

843
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,500
The craft of it.
I love the idea of forging things.

844
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:03,220
I just think I find that fascinating and
I follow like dozens of these guys on

845
00:42:05,301 --> 00:42:10,301
instagram that make knives and hatchets
and metal work and tools and furniture

846
00:42:10,971 --> 00:42:12,770
and shit.
I'm not making furniture.

847
00:42:12,771 --> 00:42:15,530
I have no desire to make furniture.
I'm not even thinking about it,

848
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,640
but I like watching this and I like
watching these people communicate with

849
00:42:19,641 --> 00:42:24,410
each other and explain the methods and
the techniques they use and this is a,

850
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,560
you know,
an avenue where a young kid could see

851
00:42:27,561 --> 00:42:29,990
something like that and go,
I want to make furniture.

852
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:32,580
Like that seems like a cool thing.
Like look at this amazing

853
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:35,500
that is too,
like when you were growing up,

854
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:38,530
you wanted to do that.
You're going to go to some library and

855
00:42:38,531 --> 00:42:42,010
go to that close to it and look things
up.

856
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:47,250
You would never see the video content
that the number of people doing that at

857
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:51,580
all.
It's so casually and quickly legitimizes

858
00:42:51,581 --> 00:42:54,340
it for you as something to think about
two or pursue.

859
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,720
That's amazing.

860
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,230
Yeah.
I had A.

861
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:01,790
I had a knife made out of meteor.
It's made out of media.

862
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:04,840
How?
How hard is media steel?

863
00:43:04,841 --> 00:43:05,810
It's metal,
it's iron.

864
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,870
Oh Wow.
They make it with the iron that came out

865
00:43:08,871 --> 00:43:11,480
of a media.
The mousy fire arts made it for me.

866
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:14,630
How did you cop media?
I've contacted them.

867
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,670
I contacted him and I,
I,

868
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:20,120
well I knew there's a guy named Steve
Kramer that makes somebody made one for

869
00:43:20,121 --> 00:43:23,580
Anthony Bourdain and uh,
and I want what he got out.

870
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:26,720
One of those.
He's got a fucking meteor knife.

871
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:29,450
How do I get to meet your knife?
So my kitchen knife is made from a

872
00:43:29,451 --> 00:43:30,560
media.
Damn.

873
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:35,200
Yeah.
Cleopatras and was made by that time.

874
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:38,480
Got a step by my knife.
Game up because I just,

875
00:43:38,481 --> 00:43:42,470
I still just use the cleaver man.
I'm so like ancient Chinese with my

876
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,300
chopping.
Just to cleaver.

877
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,650
Well it's not the wrong with a
cleveland.

878
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:48,020
This is,
it just looks cool because I know it

879
00:43:48,021 --> 00:43:49,280
came from bad.
I could,

880
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:49,791
yeah.
No,

881
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:51,340
I could expand the arsenal.
Adam,

882
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:55,040
media chef's knife to tell everyone that
came from a meteor when they come into

883
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:56,690
your kitchen.
So you just sort of impressive.

884
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,970
He showed it to a couple of people.
I just got it recently,

885
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,040
but it's a,
I just,

886
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,720
I think that this new world of,
uh,

887
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:09,830
of the Internet in terms of like is the
ability to explore these communities and

888
00:44:09,831 --> 00:44:11,060
like you said,
video,

889
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:14,210
like see the video of someone like this
clock,

890
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:16,880
this a russell bill made this clock for
us,

891
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:18,920
that the grandfather clock.
I mean,

892
00:44:18,921 --> 00:44:22,670
that dude made that all of the metal.
He welded it all,

893
00:44:22,671 --> 00:44:24,410
put it all together.
I mean this,

894
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:28,970
this kind of stuff to me is so
fascinating and I don't just like it

895
00:44:28,971 --> 00:44:31,040
because I'm interested in the craft of
it all.

896
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,070
I like it because I see it as an
opportunity for people to get out of the

897
00:44:35,071 --> 00:44:38,430
grind.
Like you can make things if you can make

898
00:44:38,431 --> 00:44:42,000
things and sell things.
If you have an Internet connection and

899
00:44:42,001 --> 00:44:45,360
you have an instagram account which is
free and you have an iphone,

900
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,220
you take your phone,
you film something,

901
00:44:47,221 --> 00:44:47,800
you

902
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,480
next thing you know you're selling
things.

903
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:50,650
I mean,
we,

904
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:54,550
it's an incredible time for like
opportunity to escape.

905
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:57,650
The biggest lie people fall for is that
they're,

906
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,190
they're bad at something or they're not
valuable.

907
00:45:00,191 --> 00:45:04,120
It's like you may be bad in this
structural definition of a human being

908
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:06,580
that goes to school and gets a nine to
five job.

909
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:08,860
I was terrible.
I was terrible at it.

910
00:45:08,861 --> 00:45:10,930
Yeah.
I got fired from a Boston market.

911
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:14,140
I got fired from the waterworks like I
couldn't work anywhere.

912
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,590
I got fired as a landscaper.
People's lawns.

913
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:20,500
I couldn't do anything,
but then it's like when you become in

914
00:45:20,501 --> 00:45:23,740
control of your own shit and you go do
what you're passionate about,

915
00:45:23,741 --> 00:45:26,560
it's like,
well then I became successful and I try

916
00:45:26,561 --> 00:45:27,930
to tell people all the time,
like,

917
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,020
if this doesn't work for you,
the straight and narrow,

918
00:45:30,021 --> 00:45:30,910
it doesn't work for you.

919
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:35,920
Like think of a way to think about what
you think your strengths are and play to

920
00:45:35,921 --> 00:45:37,960
that.
Don't let anyone tell you you're a

921
00:45:37,961 --> 00:45:39,580
failure.
You're unsuccessful because you don't

922
00:45:39,581 --> 00:45:41,560
fit.
The stereotype I think is really

923
00:45:41,561 --> 00:45:45,070
important though for successful people
like yourself to tell their failure

924
00:45:45,071 --> 00:45:47,590
stories.
We don't do that enough.

925
00:45:47,591 --> 00:45:49,090
Well,
I mean I lost a restaurant because I

926
00:45:49,091 --> 00:45:51,250
sold all.
You can drink four Loko like that was

927
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:55,210
like I went out in flames.
You can drink for local sounds like a

928
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:58,240
liability when you're good at telling
stories,

929
00:45:58,241 --> 00:46:00,100
but I think that that's true.
Generally,

930
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,930
I feel like I wish I could ask every
member of Congress to tell a failure

931
00:46:04,931 --> 00:46:06,160
story.
They would never do that.

932
00:46:06,161 --> 00:46:08,200
Those people are trying to pretend
they're something different.

933
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:11,990
Well,
I was a terrible law student.

934
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:18,240
Anything more explosive like before you
ever sell for local at a lemonade stand?

935
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,200
I can tell you I absolutely never did
that and probably never will.

936
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,830
Any other failures?
Uh,

937
00:46:26,831 --> 00:46:28,360
yeah.
I got some parenting failures that I'm

938
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:30,520
going to save my children from
announcing in public

939
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:32,500
call.
Good call.

940
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:36,190
Yeah.
I feel like it's important for people to

941
00:46:36,191 --> 00:46:37,450
relate,
right?

942
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,100
They have to be able to say,
oh,

943
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:44,160
Eddie wasn't always a successful guy.
Like he was a 19 year old kid wants to.

944
00:46:44,351 --> 00:46:47,350
That was also struggling.
That's very important.

945
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,520
It's very,
it's.

946
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:52,960
I think it's one of the most important
things that people can understand that

947
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:58,070
failure is an opportunity to learn and
that horrible feeling of failure is

948
00:46:58,331 --> 00:47:01,240
really your friend.
Does that horrible feeling motivates you

949
00:47:01,241 --> 00:47:02,010
to change?

950
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:04,320
I mean I feel all the time I played
basketball yesterday.

951
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,580
We had a double header.
I was,

952
00:47:05,581 --> 00:47:09,510
I was cooking on a grill.
I was making lamb skewers for four hours

953
00:47:09,511 --> 00:47:14,010
in the morning when straight from the
kitchen to this basketball game and San

954
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:16,200
Gabriel valley playing with.
It's like an Asian basketball league.

955
00:47:16,201 --> 00:47:18,160
So I'm actually like kind of toll like
um,

956
00:47:18,161 --> 00:47:22,710
like a small forward and there's like
little younger dudes at 25 running

957
00:47:22,711 --> 00:47:25,080
around me.
I did not have played well the first

958
00:47:25,081 --> 00:47:28,920
game I was washed the second game and
these kids probably like 23,

959
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:30,070
four years

960
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:34,400
old running past me,
elbowing me and I got so mad and I act

961
00:47:34,401 --> 00:47:36,220
it out.
I started like yelling at them.

962
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:41,221
I started like beefing and I got home
and I told my fiance about it and she's

963
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:41,891
like,
Yo,

964
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:44,890
why are you beefing with these kids?
They're 25,

965
00:47:44,891 --> 00:47:46,060
like,
like your old.

966
00:47:46,061 --> 00:47:48,880
Of course they're gonna run by you,
you playing a double header and you came

967
00:47:48,881 --> 00:47:52,510
out of the kitchen.
And it was funny because I was like not

968
00:47:52,511 --> 00:47:54,850
willing to let it go.
But then I was like,

969
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,070
I got to work on myself like every
single day,

970
00:47:57,071 --> 00:48:01,120
like I fail at something and I failed at
being like the elder statesmen in the

971
00:48:01,121 --> 00:48:02,620
basketball.
We're being composed,

972
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:04,810
being composed.
I lost my composure and I started making

973
00:48:04,811 --> 00:48:06,670
fun of these kids for no reason.
And I was like,

974
00:48:06,671 --> 00:48:08,350
that's not me.
You know,

975
00:48:08,351 --> 00:48:10,540
like basketball sometimes brings out the
worst in me,

976
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,370
but I was like,
all right,

977
00:48:12,371 --> 00:48:14,680
today I'm going to be a better person.
We'll go back to that week,

978
00:48:14,681 --> 00:48:18,520
next week I'm gonna be like a nice dude.
And if some kid washes me in west me in

979
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:19,570
the face,
it gets fine.

980
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,110
Well

981
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:22,480
Times you just need to experience it so
that you know,

982
00:48:22,481 --> 00:48:24,400
okay,
I just have to be more composed when

983
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:27,340
that comes up and when you didn't expect
to experience it.

984
00:48:27,341 --> 00:48:28,720
And then someone hits you with that
elbow,

985
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:29,890
you're like,
what?

986
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:31,870
Fuck you man.
And the next thing you know,

987
00:48:31,871 --> 00:48:32,704
it's intense

988
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:33,940
boxing,
basketball,

989
00:48:33,941 --> 00:48:36,260
it's the most like sports system.
Most humbling thing for me.

990
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,730
I'm not built for it.
I kind of built to fail at sport,

991
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,800
but you try anyway.
I try because I try because it's the

992
00:48:44,801 --> 00:48:45,970
thing I'm the worst at,

993
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:47,550
so I always wanted.
Well,

994
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:51,000
it's great for the mind.
The thing about sports is you're forcing

995
00:48:51,001 --> 00:48:54,840
your body to do things that are
uncomfortable and in doing that you're

996
00:48:54,841 --> 00:48:58,230
not just exercising your body.
You're also exercising your mind and

997
00:48:58,231 --> 00:49:01,590
that's one of the things that I always
try to relate to people that are

998
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,430
negative about physical exercise and
exertion because they think that it's

999
00:49:05,431 --> 00:49:09,080
some sort of a frivolous venture that's
just vanity.

1000
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:14,130
Just want to look good or use your body,
but there's a mental aspect to having

1001
00:49:14,791 --> 00:49:19,710
the ability to push through discomfort
that is extremely valuable and if you

1002
00:49:19,711 --> 00:49:23,280
don't have that switch where you can be
comfortable being uncomfortable because

1003
00:49:23,281 --> 00:49:24,960
you've done it a million times.
If you don't,

1004
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:27,450
then you're.
You're gonna be panicky.

1005
00:49:27,451 --> 00:49:30,960
You're going to be weirded out by it,
and that is a mental weakness.

1006
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:35,640
So in that ability to push through
discomfort helps you not just in

1007
00:49:35,641 --> 00:49:39,180
physical exercise and exertion,
but it also helps you in work.

1008
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:42,990
I'll give you have to push through
certain work things instead of getting

1009
00:49:42,991 --> 00:49:45,960
up and getting another cup of coffee,
figuring out what the fuck you're doing,

1010
00:49:45,961 --> 00:49:47,940
figure out what,
what's this problem you're working on?

1011
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:51,480
Concentrate like focus you get out,
get after it.

1012
00:49:51,481 --> 00:49:53,280
Be comfortable being uncomfortable.

1013
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,410
I don't believe in trickle down
economics,

1014
00:49:55,411 --> 00:49:57,720
but I believe in trickle down mental
strength,

1015
00:49:57,810 --> 00:50:01,050
you know what I mean?
I start in the gym every morning and

1016
00:50:01,051 --> 00:50:03,750
like whatever happens in the gym,
it humbles me.

1017
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:05,150
It gives me like,
you know,

1018
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:08,640
some kind of like energy and I bring
that throughout the day.

1019
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,560
Like what got you hooked in Jujitsu?

1020
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:12,540
Well,
I've done martial arts since I was a

1021
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:15,330
little kid,
but I think there's something that is

1022
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:19,680
inescapable in my life at least,
and that is that there is no disconnect

1023
00:50:19,681 --> 00:50:20,760
between the mind,
the body,

1024
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:25,620
that they're all one thing and that you
can work them individually but not

1025
00:50:25,621 --> 00:50:28,040
really because when you working your
body,

1026
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:31,790
you need the mind to do that.
The intensity of my workouts is one of

1027
00:50:31,791 --> 00:50:35,420
the most important aspects of it and
that's fuel 100 percent by my mind.

1028
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:36,650
It's not by my body

1029
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,300
and Plato said that since fifth century,
he always wrote about like how training

1030
00:50:40,301 --> 00:50:42,090
the body is just as important as
training

1031
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,180
the rest of your martial arts.
I mean it's just,

1032
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:50,340
it's everything because your high level
problem solving with bad physical

1033
00:50:50,341 --> 00:50:51,260
consequences,
you're,

1034
00:50:51,261 --> 00:50:56,261
you're trying to avoid injury and
humiliation and all these various things

1035
00:50:57,601 --> 00:51:02,070
that are a part of martial arts and in
the meantime you're trying to maintain

1036
00:51:02,071 --> 00:51:07,071
composure under pressure and you're
tired and you have to understand the

1037
00:51:07,411 --> 00:51:11,130
ability to push and push through
discomfort and push through exhaustion,

1038
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:14,130
but it also fuels the mind.
It's very important.

1039
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,410
Yeah.
Fighting that three round fight.

1040
00:51:16,411 --> 00:51:19,440
I was like my first three round fight.
I got so scared.

1041
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:21,900
I was shaking the whole time,
but I just told myself,

1042
00:51:21,901 --> 00:51:24,390
dude,
there's no backing out in the ring.

1043
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,820
You have to go forward.
Keep going forward.

1044
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:29,760
And like just out of fear.
I'm a pressure fighter.

1045
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:33,270
Do you mean like just out of fear,
like I have to be a pressure fighter

1046
00:51:33,271 --> 00:51:37,920
because I don't think in my first fight
I knew I did not have like the in me to

1047
00:51:37,921 --> 00:51:40,430
counter or or do what like the game plan
was.

1048
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,170
I was like,
I just have to pressure like I have

1049
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,310
these hands and move these feet.
But then I got through.

1050
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:47,250
I got lumped up a few times.
I won the fight,

1051
00:51:47,251 --> 00:51:48,300
but I was like,
whoa.

1052
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:52,050
I feel like I could do anything now.
And so now I keep sparring and I keep

1053
00:51:52,051 --> 00:51:55,980
fighting because I,
if I can be composed in the ring with

1054
00:51:55,981 --> 00:51:57,990
someone trying to kill me,
then like I,

1055
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:02,270
I can be composed on a podcast or in a
meeting or negotiation.

1056
00:52:02,271 --> 00:52:03,360
It's,
it's the best.

1057
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:04,463
Martial arts

1058
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:06,960
is a vehicle for developing your human
potential.

1059
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:10,710
Then that those things are all connected
and it's a,

1060
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:14,400
it's a critical lesson for,
for young people and if you can push

1061
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:17,760
through hard workouts,
you could push through whatever career

1062
00:52:17,761 --> 00:52:19,030
path you want.
You're trying

1063
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:24,380
breaches me respect too because it's
like you can get bodied anytime you can

1064
00:52:24,381 --> 00:52:28,850
get dropped at any time,
like be grateful for when you have both

1065
00:52:28,851 --> 00:52:31,580
arms and legs and you're standing on
your two feet because you could be

1066
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:33,740
dropped at any second.
So.

1067
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,540
But I mean,
do,

1068
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:36,200
do you do physical activities?
Sports?

1069
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:38,630
Yeah,
I know she'd been waiting to jump in

1070
00:52:38,631 --> 00:52:39,950
this conversation.
Well,

1071
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:42,890
I grew up in new England in cold
country.

1072
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:44,840
Where?
In Connecticut?

1073
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:47,630
Connecticut.
Outside of Hartford.

1074
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,310
Okay.
You're one of those people,

1075
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,110
is that.
It's like a westport and I think my

1076
00:52:51,111 --> 00:52:54,050
girls from the westport in New York
City.

1077
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:54,651
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1078
00:52:54,651 --> 00:52:55,640
yeah.
She from West Florida.

1079
00:52:55,670 --> 00:53:00,670
So I grew up skiing all the time and uh,
I still love skiing.

1080
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:06,410
I still,
I need the thrill of flying off of

1081
00:53:06,411 --> 00:53:10,310
something that makes me uncomfortable in
order to relax in a perverse way.

1082
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,380
So when I have vacations,
that's what I do.

1083
00:53:12,381 --> 00:53:16,340
I take my kids who right now live in DC
with me and it's pretty flat there.

1084
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:19,670
So you got to go take them to see some
mountains and you got to go make sure

1085
00:53:19,671 --> 00:53:24,230
that they go down something that's a
little bit too steep every single time

1086
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,070
because I.
You build some

1087
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:29,460
resilience when you get down something
like that and you turn around and say,

1088
00:53:29,461 --> 00:53:32,070
well I did that.
I can do some other things.

1089
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:36,150
I think there's some resilience in
living in Connecticut too

1090
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:41,970
cold,
weird and plus it's not really a state.

1091
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:46,350
Connecticut's like a highway between New
York and Boston now I would.

1092
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,380
Connecticut,
Connecticut,

1093
00:53:49,381 --> 00:53:52,920
Rhode Island,
California.

1094
00:53:52,921 --> 00:53:55,450
People if you're not crossing.
Oh,

1095
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,860
I married someone and grew up in Boston.
Boston,

1096
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:03,750
Boston
have ideas.

1097
00:54:03,751 --> 00:54:06,270
I never would have thought you were from
Boston where I was born in New Jersey,

1098
00:54:06,271 --> 00:54:09,240
but I grew up in Boston,
got rid of it,

1099
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,340
hurt myself on tv when I was 19 and I
was like,

1100
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:12,940
fuck that accent.

1101
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:19,110
So embarrassed.
Listen to my own accent.

1102
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:23,490
Go home and I hear people with New
England accent and it feels like sweet

1103
00:54:23,491 --> 00:54:26,850
and comforting.
It's great putting drunk there was

1104
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,110
drunk.
It seems like it's normal.

1105
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:29,940
Can you do.
Can you do a little bit of one right

1106
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:31,810
now?
Uh,

1107
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:34,430
I could see.
I thought you like listening to the

1108
00:54:34,431 --> 00:54:36,090
Utah.
I thought you were from the south for a

1109
00:54:36,091 --> 00:54:37,980
second.
No,

1110
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:40,620
no,
because you don't have a new England

1111
00:54:40,621 --> 00:54:41,370
accent.
No,

1112
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:42,450
no,
no,

1113
00:54:42,451 --> 00:54:44,400
but I've been living in Washington for a
little while.

1114
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:47,490
Plus she's a politician.
You got to get rid of the shit.

1115
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:51,630
You have the ill politician like the
meter talking.

1116
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:58,410
It's on like a metronome smooth.
It's good.

1117
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,810
It's good.
It's a good thing.

1118
00:55:00,811 --> 00:55:02,340
Do you ever.
Do you ever do this thing with your

1119
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:04,170
hands?
Like Clinton used to do the thing where

1120
00:55:04,171 --> 00:55:07,770
you hold your phone like that do this
thing what we need to do in this

1121
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:09,660
country.
I never understood that.

1122
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:12,960
People would always tell me when I do
voiceover,

1123
00:55:12,961 --> 00:55:15,140
like slow down,
slow down and like I can't slow down.

1124
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,310
My voice totally changes.
If I slow down,

1125
00:55:17,311 --> 00:55:19,230
I just got to come,
like shot out of the case.

1126
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,930
True.
If you go back to Washington,

1127
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,480
you decide with your congressional
campaign,

1128
00:55:24,481 --> 00:55:27,270
it's all going to happen.
You are going to slow down when you

1129
00:55:27,271 --> 00:55:28,360
speak.
Yeah.

1130
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:30,540
Like you can hear your periods and
commas.

1131
00:55:30,541 --> 00:55:34,110
I just run through sentences with trump
as president.

1132
00:55:34,111 --> 00:55:36,210
I think all bets are off.
I think you do whatever you want.

1133
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:40,430
No,
I don't think there's any rules can call

1134
00:55:40,431 --> 00:55:41,990
into other countries.
Shitholes.

1135
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:43,450
You can get crazy.
Joel.

1136
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:45,200
I'm telling you.
I really think you should run.

1137
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:48,450
You can bring mad people together.
What does that mean?

1138
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:53,540
I'd use you bring people together and
also like I think number one.

1139
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,030
Number one,
like I think you're one of the few dudes

1140
00:55:57,031 --> 00:56:00,960
who can get the like really wild white
people to like think about things like

1141
00:56:00,961 --> 00:56:03,030
consider them.
Be Like have some perspective and

1142
00:56:03,031 --> 00:56:07,720
empathy.
Like the wildlings internet walk.

1143
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:08,861
Yeah.
I,

1144
00:56:08,861 --> 00:56:10,350
I really believe it.
Joe,

1145
00:56:10,351 --> 00:56:11,760
as the guy that's like,
alright,

1146
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,670
the crazies trust him and then like he,
he,

1147
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:17,730
he can get them to think about things
from a different perspective.

1148
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:19,710
I don't know if that's good.
No,

1149
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:22,620
it's a good thing dude.
Like you appeal to you appeal to like

1150
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,010
all people but like,

1151
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:26,290
like I meet a lot of people,
they run up on me like,

1152
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:27,400
Yo,
you're on Jerry.

1153
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:28,900
You're pretty left.
You're a little,

1154
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:31,270
you're a little crazy,
but I enjoyed talking to you and I'm

1155
00:56:31,271 --> 00:56:31,630
like,
Yo,

1156
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:32,660
thank you man.
Like I,

1157
00:56:32,661 --> 00:56:36,760
I mean I come on the show so I can speak
to a different audience than just like,

1158
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:37,931
you know,
hip hop,

1159
00:56:37,931 --> 00:56:42,931
Asian dudes in my dms
dudes that like Migos and soy sauce,

1160
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:47,230
like
it's not that big

1161
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:50,560
niche.
There's a weird thing about the

1162
00:56:50,561 --> 00:56:52,390
listeners of this podcast.
If they don't,

1163
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:54,160
they're not left or right.
No,

1164
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:57,100
it was like a weird mixture of people,
but that's good.

1165
00:56:57,101 --> 00:57:01,120
That's so much more of that country
right now.

1166
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:02,770
I mean we're,
we're not gonna,

1167
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:05,650
we're not gonna do things if we don't
start listening to each other.

1168
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,890
Like I don't usually identify as left
his people call me that.

1169
00:57:08,891 --> 00:57:12,420
But it's like your content on the show
galvanizes cats from like all around

1170
00:57:12,421 --> 00:57:12,540
around the

1171
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:13,620
world.
Well,

1172
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,560
I,
I don't identify as left either,

1173
00:57:16,561 --> 00:57:20,940
but I do when it comes to so many issues
when it comes to gay rights,

1174
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:25,140
when it comes to civil rights,
when it comes to just across the board

1175
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:27,630
things that you would automatically
consider liberal,

1176
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:32,040
but also the freedom to express
yourself.

1177
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:36,240
Like that's,
that to me is the marketplace of free

1178
00:57:36,241 --> 00:57:40,260
ideas is one of the most important
aspects of developing a civilization.

1179
00:57:40,261 --> 00:57:44,460
It's one of the most important ways that
we understand about each other and you

1180
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,910
got to have an open mind.
It's like I was saying like you bring up

1181
00:57:47,911 --> 00:57:49,950
that universal basic income and I was
like,

1182
00:57:49,951 --> 00:57:52,560
get the fuck out of here with that.
And then I thought about it afterwards

1183
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:54,270
and I was like,
maybe there's some,

1184
00:57:54,271 --> 00:57:58,650
maybe I,
I always liked to explore my reactions

1185
00:57:58,651 --> 00:58:02,940
to things and if I had a reaction to
something and I automatically dismiss

1186
00:58:02,941 --> 00:58:03,271
it,
I go,

1187
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,520
okay,
was that valid or did I just dismiss it?

1188
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:10,520
Because it's easier than to have a
nuanced perspective that's formed over

1189
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:16,521
time and a lot of critical thinking.
And so I stopped and thought about it

1190
00:58:16,771 --> 00:58:20,160
all and I think at the very least it's
something that merits consideration and

1191
00:58:20,161 --> 00:58:23,010
maybe it could be a of some sort of a
project.

1192
00:58:23,011 --> 00:58:23,844
Let's go.
Let's see.

1193
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:25,860
Let's see if that works.
Yeah,

1194
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:28,590
we have some countries doing that right
now though.

1195
00:58:28,591 --> 00:58:32,040
They're different than us culturally.
And I think culturally as part of it,

1196
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,510
that is a problem.
Well,

1197
00:58:33,511 --> 00:58:38,511
America is just so based on competition.
Competition is so powerful over here and

1198
00:58:39,151 --> 00:58:42,300
I think that's good.
And I also think that's bad because

1199
00:58:42,301 --> 00:58:46,490
ultimately it's like if you could grab
trump and and,

1200
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:51,630
and get him on mushrooms and lead,
explain just somehow or another let the

1201
00:58:52,201 --> 00:58:55,890
universe explained to him,
this is a temporary experience.

1202
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:59,880
You're trying to gather up all this
money and gather up all these resources

1203
00:58:59,881 --> 00:59:04,080
and gather up all this influence when
this is all fleeting.

1204
00:59:04,081 --> 00:59:06,090
It's sand,
it's slips between your fingers.

1205
00:59:06,091 --> 00:59:08,010
There's no way you can grasp it for
real.

1206
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:13,460
The real experience is the shared
moments that we have with each other and

1207
00:59:14,011 --> 00:59:16,950
the more we can enhance that for the
people around us,

1208
00:59:16,951 --> 00:59:21,951
the more you can use your power to
enhance people's perspective,

1209
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:27,970
change people's way of interfacing with
this world that we live in and we

1210
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:34,070
recognize that we're all just living
together.

1211
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:37,460
We're all just a part of this community,
this competition thing.

1212
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:39,830
Most of the competition is with
yourself,

1213
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,710
most of it,
the vast majority of it,

1214
00:59:42,711 --> 00:59:45,290
and those other people that you're
competing with,

1215
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:48,350
you should cherish them because their
fuel,

1216
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,690
all those people,
instead of looking at them as the enemy,

1217
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:55,610
those people are your friends.
Although your most bitter rivals are the

1218
00:59:55,611 --> 00:59:57,740
greatest motivators you're ever going to
experience.

1219
00:59:57,890 --> 00:59:59,360
Those are the people that are going to
push you,

1220
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:01,840
but don't be toxic about it.
Yeah,

1221
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:03,210
you can be.
You can be.

1222
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,630
You can be peaceful about it.
Yet Joe,

1223
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:08,210
I love competition because it's number
one.

1224
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:10,340
It's amazing to watch like,
you know,

1225
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:11,710
low,
uh,

1226
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,910
Klitschko Anthony,
Joshua,

1227
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:16,490
I think greatest fighter like the last
20 years,

1228
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,353
like hazing,
boxing,

1229
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,360
match for that boxing match,
Loma Chenko,

1230
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:20,810
Reagan's.

1231
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:22,820
That's not competition,
you know,

1232
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:23,710
like that.
That was,

1233
01:00:23,711 --> 01:00:25,910
that's an experienced though.
That's,

1234
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:28,100
that's an experience.
Total diss snatching.

1235
01:00:28,101 --> 01:00:28,791
Have a soul.
Well,

1236
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:31,360
he's a different animal.
Loma Cenk goes a different thing.

1237
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:33,500
The Matrix.
Do you know the story about his dad?

1238
01:00:33,501 --> 01:00:37,910
Would his dad made him do know,
made him stop boxing and do a Ukrainian

1239
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:41,660
dance for four years.
That's why he's got that ridiculous

1240
01:00:41,661 --> 01:00:46,430
footwork because footwork is everything.
And I know he does a number association

1241
01:00:46,431 --> 01:00:47,540
too,
which is crazy.

1242
01:00:47,541 --> 01:00:50,220
But what I was saying about competition
is like,

1243
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:52,820
you know,
Pete piloting and was we need

1244
01:00:52,821 --> 01:00:54,030
competition.
We need competition.

1245
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:56,000
Like,
but who is competing with service

1246
01:00:56,001 --> 01:00:57,740
providers?
There is no competition.

1247
01:00:57,741 --> 01:01:00,110
It's just beating up on a bomb.
You know,

1248
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:03,110
it's like we all live to watch great
competition,

1249
01:01:03,111 --> 01:01:07,850
but you have to foster competitors.
You need actual competitors for there to

1250
01:01:07,851 --> 01:01:08,360
be competent.

1251
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:11,870
Imagine if what we're experiencing with
Internet was also with food.

1252
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:16,340
Imagine if like only certain people
could bring you your food.

1253
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:17,360
Yeah.
You know like,

1254
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,160
Oh,
you live in Charleston.

1255
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:20,960
Yeah,
you gotta get your food from Mike.

1256
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:23,870
Yet it's basically like growing up
eating food in Orlando.

1257
01:01:23,871 --> 01:01:27,200
There's like one in a category of food
for your mind.

1258
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:29,390
Yeah.
Food for your mind is real.

1259
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:32,720
I mean the fuel that you get them,
the information that you get from the

1260
01:01:32,721 --> 01:01:35,720
Internet,
that is fuel for your mind and whether

1261
01:01:35,721 --> 01:01:39,260
you get it in the form of actual food or
whether you get it in the form of

1262
01:01:39,261 --> 01:01:42,490
information.
These are both very critical things that

1263
01:01:42,491 --> 01:01:46,610
you need a wide variety of different
sources for,

1264
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,470
but you bring up a good point.
Even just,

1265
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,090
let's say food delivery,
right?

1266
01:01:50,091 --> 01:01:52,400
It started off,
you would call the restaurants and it

1267
01:01:52,401 --> 01:01:53,030
was difficult.

1268
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:55,070
You had to save the menu from every
restaurant.

1269
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:57,020
Then seamless comes around and they're
like,

1270
01:01:57,021 --> 01:01:58,970
all right,
we're putting all the menus on here and

1271
01:01:58,971 --> 01:02:01,940
we're just helping facilitate.
You get things from the restaurant,

1272
01:02:01,941 --> 01:02:06,470
but it wasn't like for restaurants we
didn't necessarily like seamless because

1273
01:02:06,471 --> 01:02:08,780
then you had to have your own delivery
workforce.

1274
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:13,100
They took a big cut of what you were
making and in a lot of restaurants they

1275
01:02:13,101 --> 01:02:17,600
didn't even break even using seamless,
so then like places like caviar came

1276
01:02:17,601 --> 01:02:21,090
around and postmates came around and
they supply the service,

1277
01:02:21,091 --> 01:02:24,450
the delivery people,
the consumer pays more for the delivery

1278
01:02:24,451 --> 01:02:26,520
and the restaurant makes their money and
it's like,

1279
01:02:26,521 --> 01:02:29,010
whoa.
Now that actually created competition

1280
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:32,880
between delivery services.
Now you have an evolution and now you

1281
01:02:32,881 --> 01:02:37,830
know everybody gets what they want.
You get service all happened over the

1282
01:02:37,831 --> 01:02:41,580
Internet.
It was all kind of little little folded

1283
01:02:41,581 --> 01:02:43,450
menu,
the kitchen drawer,

1284
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:44,363
right?

1285
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:49,420
Like that's how we used to do it and if
you lived in New York you get home and

1286
01:02:49,421 --> 01:02:50,810
it's just like 20 Sushi,
making

1287
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:57,810
empire,
putting something under my door,

1288
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:03,110
a lot of slip and fall in your own
apartment cases from those wickets.

1289
01:03:03,230 --> 01:03:05,670
What happened and what's happened
through the Internet in terms of people

1290
01:03:05,671 --> 01:03:08,190
not drinking and driving because of
Uber.

1291
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:10,380
That's changed the way people get
around.

1292
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:13,770
If I went to high school with Uber,
I would have been good.

1293
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:14,421
When.
When?

1294
01:03:14,421 --> 01:03:15,930
When were you in front of the comedy
store?

1295
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:19,560
Lift is blocking the Goddamn driveway to
the comedy store.

1296
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:21,540
Nine out of 10 times when you're allowed
to leave.

1297
01:03:21,541 --> 01:03:23,820
There's a car pulled up there which is,
look,

1298
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:25,500
it's,
it's an inconvenience,

1299
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:28,350
but man,
it's so nice to see drunk people just

1300
01:03:28,351 --> 01:03:30,570
getting driven around.
They need to be.

1301
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:32,510
They may be jumping around.
It's interesting.

1302
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,800
We don't talk a lot about the safety
element of that,

1303
01:03:34,801 --> 01:03:39,300
but it's so amazing.
It's also young people are not buying

1304
01:03:39,301 --> 01:03:43,290
cars like they used to.
Used to be that getting a car entailed

1305
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:44,700
your freedom.
Right.

1306
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:50,360
And one more device centric where you go
and what you do with virtual physical

1307
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:54,060
car anymore.
You were segregated because I went to a

1308
01:03:54,061 --> 01:03:56,910
school where people were bused in from
different parts so you could be friends

1309
01:03:56,911 --> 01:03:59,160
with someone at school,
but if they don't have a car or they

1310
01:03:59,161 --> 01:04:01,140
live 45 minutes,
you can't be friends,

1311
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,690
but now you can all meet each other up.
You can,

1312
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:04,590
they,
you know,

1313
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:07,140
they may not be able to rent the car or
have a car,

1314
01:04:07,141 --> 01:04:09,240
but they can take uber and meet you up.
Yeah.

1315
01:04:09,241 --> 01:04:12,750
And that really is another aspect of the
Internet that a lot of times we don't

1316
01:04:12,751 --> 01:04:16,380
take into consideration is cellular,
mobile apps,

1317
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:17,550
apps are the Internet.

1318
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:19,410
I mean it is everything through the
Internet,

1319
01:04:19,411 --> 01:04:23,250
but it's in this little device that you
keep in your pocket and twitter,

1320
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:27,030
facebook and instagram and all these
different live in a mobile first world.

1321
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:31,480
Anyone who's building a website now,
it should be built for that device

1322
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:36,710
because that's the first place most
people experience that online.

1323
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,700
And the only concern that I have about
that though is that,

1324
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:43,860
you know,
ultimately we want people to not just be

1325
01:04:43,861 --> 01:04:46,530
digital consumers but to be digital
creators.

1326
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:52,310
And some people
think more of us should be.

1327
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:55,800
I don't,
I don't think people building things

1328
01:04:55,801 --> 01:04:56,431
should be,
you know,

1329
01:04:56,431 --> 01:04:58,170
a bunch of guys in hoodies in their
twenties.

1330
01:04:58,171 --> 01:05:00,270
I think that,
no,

1331
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:04,440
I agree with the digital world should
look as diverse as all of us.

1332
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:05,340
Yeah,
sure.

1333
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:08,400
I hope on a going forward basis,
we're going to fix this internet

1334
01:05:08,401 --> 01:05:09,840
situation with net neutrality.

1335
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:14,010
And we're also going to diversify the
universe of people who build things for

1336
01:05:14,011 --> 01:05:14,960
our online more.
Well,

1337
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:19,090
we really see that in the podcast world.
The podcast world is extremely diverse.

1338
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:22,420
There's so many different Po.
I mean whatever you're into,

1339
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:26,290
you can find a category and a whole
shitload of people that are making

1340
01:05:26,291 --> 01:05:30,340
podcasts about it and it's really sad.
Five podcasts on sleeping.

1341
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:35,700
You probably haven't done a ton on food,
right?

1342
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:39,700
Food food is actually,
when I was working on this net

1343
01:05:39,701 --> 01:05:43,150
neutrality should I have worked with the
today show and they wanted to find

1344
01:05:43,151 --> 01:05:46,930
someone who built a business online and
they spent time with this woman,

1345
01:05:46,931 --> 01:05:50,950
I think it was Laura's kitchen and she
had basically started just putting

1346
01:05:50,951 --> 01:05:54,640
videos on Youtube,
showing herself and how she was cooking

1347
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:58,510
and then you know,
that morphed over time into a book and a

1348
01:05:58,511 --> 01:06:01,660
big empire and she built something from
it and it's amazing.

1349
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:06,660
If you look at how much cooking has
evolved from just hobby online to actual

1350
01:06:07,301 --> 01:06:09,430
business,
it's extraordinary.

1351
01:06:09,431 --> 01:06:11,440
It's undeniable.
I mean for,

1352
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:12,980
for younger people listening,
they're,

1353
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:14,470
oh,
they're probably just like guys,

1354
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:16,180
we know like the,
like everything.

1355
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,200
It's,
it's undoubted.

1356
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:22,270
Everything happens on the Internet and
so for it to become this thing that's

1357
01:06:22,271 --> 01:06:25,600
not regulated is insane.
It's like it's like getting our roads

1358
01:06:25,601 --> 01:06:27,820
taken away.
You don't want like regulation,

1359
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:31,000
which you want is just a little bit of
oversight to make sure that it's fair.

1360
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,910
I think that's a good way to put it
because I don't.

1361
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:36,490
I think when we break in a regulation or
deregulation,

1362
01:06:36,491 --> 01:06:38,410
we lose the point.
The point is you just want a little

1363
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:42,410
oversight to make sure it's fair and
open to all equal playing ground in that

1364
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:47,050
everybody's allowed to come to this and
recognize it as an important resource

1365
01:06:47,051 --> 01:06:47,590
that it is.

1366
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:51,820
The ability to distribute information is
critical to changing the culture,

1367
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:54,940
the way we interface with each other,
the way we talk,

1368
01:06:55,090 --> 01:07:00,090
the experiences that we share,
the way we have access to all these new

1369
01:07:00,221 --> 01:07:03,340
ideas and information.
It's just shifting things that this

1370
01:07:03,341 --> 01:07:05,920
radical warp speed,
warp speed,

1371
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:07,090
warp speed,
it's just.

1372
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:12,190
It's the weirdest time ever and so for
this to be a monkey wrench thrown into

1373
01:07:13,061 --> 01:07:16,120
the gears of this by five people,
three shoes,

1374
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,313
three,
sorry,

1375
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:20,270
present company.
Yes.

1376
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:21,590
It's just,
it's,

1377
01:07:21,650 --> 01:07:24,010
it's hard to imagine that that's going
to stick,

1378
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:28,030
but with this administration,
it's not stunning because it seems like

1379
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:33,250
net neutrality being dissolved favors
these big businesses that would like to

1380
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,760
maximize their profits.
And Net neutrality is the ultimate

1381
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:37,870
populist issue,
right?

1382
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:41,860
Because it empowers all of us online.
So.

1383
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,050
Yeah.
So.

1384
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:47,620
So write letters,
make calls,

1385
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,210
be annoying.
You have to be annoying.

1386
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:50,430
Run,
run,

1387
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:55,270
run for president
in 2020 Eddie and Oprah.

1388
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:56,193
Eddie,
Joe,

1389
01:07:56,950 --> 01:07:58,300
Joe,
and Joe's a good ticket,

1390
01:07:58,301 --> 01:07:59,230
bro.
I'm not doing it,

1391
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:01,350
but good luck.
Good luck.

1392
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:04,990
You and Oprah.
I think you're going to be living your

1393
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:07,960
best life.
What's that mean?

1394
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:11,580
What does oprah appraisal?
Oh my bad boy.

1395
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:13,330
Oprah.
Is that part of the secret?

1396
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:15,230
You're going to have to work with your
running mate on that.

1397
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:18,410
So,
um,

1398
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,393
this

1399
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:20,860
w,

1400
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:23,560
the situation that we're in right now,
do you,

1401
01:08:23,561 --> 01:08:27,550
are you confident that there is real
potential for it to be reversed?

1402
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:33,680
I am optimistic that the American public
are awoke and they're paying attention

1403
01:08:34,951 --> 01:08:36,990
now and they're making a Ruckus.
I mean,

1404
01:08:37,290 --> 01:08:41,310
we had millions of people write us at
the FCC when I got appointed to the FCC,

1405
01:08:41,311 --> 01:08:44,460
I didn't think millions of people knew
what the FCC was.

1406
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:48,480
I think that's extraordinary and I'm not
ready to give up.

1407
01:08:48,910 --> 01:08:51,070
Well,
the last time the FCC was in the

1408
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:53,770
mainstream news is when you guys were
finding Howard Stern.

1409
01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:58,690
That predates my tough course.
Does that was also during the George

1410
01:08:58,690 --> 01:09:01,000
Bush administration.
How'd you get to the FCC?

1411
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:06,240
So before I was appointed,
I served as counsel to the Senate

1412
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:12,850
Commerce Committee and um,
I worked there for Senator Rockefeller

1413
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:16,150
for a long time and first senator in a
way before that.

1414
01:09:16,690 --> 01:09:18,320
And um,
so I,

1415
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:23,110
I got like a front row seat at a whole
bunch of digital issues with how we deal

1416
01:09:23,111 --> 01:09:26,800
with our wireless spectrum,
how we change our television technology.

1417
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,301
So,
you know,

1418
01:09:28,301 --> 01:09:31,090
I'm a real kind of nerdy Washington
thing,

1419
01:09:31,091 --> 01:09:35,740
but also a new way to see how everything
is changing in our economy because of

1420
01:09:35,741 --> 01:09:38,680
digitization.
What's your thoughts on

1421
01:09:38,681 --> 01:09:41,470
cryptocurrencies?
I'm,

1422
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:44,740
you know,
so I have no special authority on this

1423
01:09:44,741 --> 01:09:46,330
except that have microphones in front of
me.

1424
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:47,830
Um,
that being said,

1425
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:49,593
yeah,
right.

1426
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,460
Uh,
I'm less interested in cryptocurrencies

1427
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:57,760
than I am in Blockchain,
which is the ledger that they use to re

1428
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:02,900
to record exchanges in cryptocurrency.
It's anonymous and it can be used by

1429
01:10:06,821 --> 01:10:07,390
anyone.

1430
01:10:07,390 --> 01:10:11,230
It's extremely low cost and I think
they're open questions about how you can

1431
01:10:11,231 --> 01:10:16,231
make government and a lot of business
services more efficient using blockchain

1432
01:10:16,961 --> 01:10:21,250
that I think are really interesting and
I have yet to be explored.

1433
01:10:21,251 --> 01:10:24,430
That's what I'm excited about.
What's one way a business could use

1434
01:10:24,431 --> 01:10:26,740
blockchain?
Um,

1435
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,680
I'll just make this up.
Say there's some kind of a,

1436
01:10:29,681 --> 01:10:33,490
you export fruit.
Someone puts a bag of that fruit on the

1437
01:10:33,491 --> 01:10:34,450
table and they say,
well,

1438
01:10:34,451 --> 01:10:37,090
we know that there are certain fields
that fruit comes from,

1439
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:38,830
you know,
there might be a disease in it.

1440
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:42,670
How can you figure out how that fruit
got here from the field?

1441
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:44,320
You know,
you can go back through your supply

1442
01:10:44,321 --> 01:10:49,000
chain and call everyone and get them to
tell you how long it sat over here and

1443
01:10:49,001 --> 01:10:52,240
who held it and put it in the truck.
The question is,

1444
01:10:52,241 --> 01:10:55,270
if you can come up with a digital way
where everyone as a collective just

1445
01:10:55,271 --> 01:10:58,390
contributes to that along the way,
can that be low cost?

1446
01:10:58,391 --> 01:11:02,620
More efficient and more effective?
I think it will change supply chain

1447
01:11:02,770 --> 01:11:07,770
economics in a really big way and we
don't fully understand the consequences

1448
01:11:08,981 --> 01:11:10,960
for our economy yet,
but I think it's coming.

1449
01:11:11,130 --> 01:11:11,650
Oh,
that,

1450
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:14,010
that makes sense.
Kind of like a wikipedia

1451
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:15,420
for each thing.
Yeah.

1452
01:11:15,421 --> 01:11:16,590
Did it with food for you?
So.

1453
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:17,570
No,
no,

1454
01:11:17,570 --> 01:11:18,031
no,
no,

1455
01:11:18,031 --> 01:11:19,230
no.
That makes sense.

1456
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:20,930
That makes a lot of sense.
No dogs.

1457
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:22,070
Yeah.

1458
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:22,660
Um,
I,

1459
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:23,550
you look at,
here's,

1460
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,320
here's high,
high level nerd,

1461
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:28,350
but our airwaves around us,
right?

1462
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:29,940
Our wireless airwaves,
that power,

1463
01:11:29,941 --> 01:11:32,190
all of our phones,
we have to divide them up.

1464
01:11:32,191 --> 01:11:34,200
You don't see it,
but it's like if there's a zone so that

1465
01:11:34,201 --> 01:11:35,940
your phone works,
the television works,

1466
01:11:35,941 --> 01:11:37,230
all of these things,
you know,

1467
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:41,040
but we also have a whole bunch of
airwaves that are only used sometimes,

1468
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:45,300
but what if we could create like
secondary and tertiary rights to use

1469
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:48,000
them so that our phones were more
powerful.

1470
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:51,900
And what if the best way to do that was
to use something like blockchain.

1471
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:54,900
I mean there's,
there's so many ways I think the

1472
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:58,980
recording ledger for cryptocurrencies
could make our economy more efficient

1473
01:11:59,010 --> 01:12:02,370
and more powerful.
And so that's what I'm interested in and

1474
01:12:02,371 --> 01:12:04,240
that's probably because I don't own any
bitcoin.

1475
01:12:04,241 --> 01:12:04,400
Yeah.

1476
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:08,540
I know people also in journalism have
been talking about keeping articles on

1477
01:12:08,541 --> 01:12:11,600
blockchain so they,
like Internet articles don't go

1478
01:12:11,601 --> 01:12:12,820
anywhere,
you know,

1479
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:15,490
because people can just erase a website,
like a website,

1480
01:12:15,670 --> 01:12:17,210
uh,
goes out of business.

1481
01:12:17,211 --> 01:12:19,190
Then all of the articles on that website
are gone.

1482
01:12:19,490 --> 01:12:22,010
So some people are putting websites on
Jean,

1483
01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:26,880
figuring out how we maintain our history
in this digital world is actually,

1484
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:28,140
it's a real thing.

1485
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:30,790
Yeah.
Yeah.

1486
01:12:30,830 --> 01:12:33,600
Especially a lot about that.
It's like cultural preservation,

1487
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:35,610
right?
If we have some sort of a solar flare

1488
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:40,920
and it kills the grid and we lose hard
drives and we there,

1489
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:44,520
that's real.
That actually could be a real thing.

1490
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:45,960
Yeah,
and blockchain.

1491
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:48,120
It's kind of an answer from keeping
information.

1492
01:12:48,810 --> 01:12:52,350
My hope is that we're going to
eventually shift to voting online.

1493
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:55,130
Does it do that,
do that?

1494
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:59,510
I think the state of Oregon that makes
experiments with that,

1495
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,720
we should study that.
We should make voting easier.

1496
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:05,450
Yes.
That's what it comes down to and make it

1497
01:13:05,451 --> 01:13:07,730
more convenient for people,
but then the thought is,

1498
01:13:07,731 --> 01:13:08,960
well,
if they're so stupid,

1499
01:13:08,961 --> 01:13:10,610
lazy,
they can't make their way to a voting

1500
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,080
booth.
Do we really want their opinion to be

1501
01:13:12,081 --> 01:13:16,610
expressed?
I think the busiest politician we talked

1502
01:13:16,611 --> 01:13:19,330
about politics,
just let us know

1503
01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:25,570
you have a job.

1504
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:28,510
If you've got kids you're trying to work
there for now and then you find out your

1505
01:13:28,511 --> 01:13:31,390
polling place is open from nine to five.
Right.

1506
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:32,920
That's a good point.
It's insulting.

1507
01:13:32,921 --> 01:13:34,600
I mean,
I know that when I voted in the

1508
01:13:34,601 --> 01:13:36,490
election,
the last election,

1509
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:39,760
presidential election,
I think you can guess the last election

1510
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:43,990
in Washington,
I had to wait 35 minutes before I got

1511
01:13:43,991 --> 01:13:47,000
in,
in the middle of my day also.

1512
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:48,000
So that's,
that's,

1513
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,930
that's a commitment.
It's a commitment I'm willing to make.

1514
01:13:49,931 --> 01:13:52,480
It's a commitment.
I'm privileged enough to take that time

1515
01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:54,420
and make it.
We got to make it easier.

1516
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:57,420
I'm absolutely joking around and I
really do think that we should make it

1517
01:13:57,421 --> 01:14:00,180
much easier to vote and I think you
should be registered to vote the same

1518
01:14:00,181 --> 01:14:03,150
way you're registered to drive.
I mean if you have a driver's license,

1519
01:14:03,151 --> 01:14:04,320
I think you should be registered to
vote.

1520
01:14:04,321 --> 01:14:07,650
I think it should be just that easy and
I think you should be able to do it

1521
01:14:07,651 --> 01:14:10,500
online and I think if you have a social
security number,

1522
01:14:10,710 --> 01:14:11,980
you should be able to vote.
I think it should be

1523
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,010
really using and I think that's not
outside the realm of possibility.

1524
01:14:15,011 --> 01:14:16,960
I think we're,
we're operating on these antiquated

1525
01:14:16,961 --> 01:14:21,910
systems and we've accepted them as fact
and this is the way things are and I

1526
01:14:21,911 --> 01:14:24,250
just think that it's nonsense.
It's not a good system.

1527
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,480
Totally.
Yeah.

1528
01:14:25,481 --> 01:14:28,300
I mean like if you live in Florida.
I remember when I was trying to vote in

1529
01:14:28,301 --> 01:14:30,040
Florida,
like the polling stations were in

1530
01:14:30,041 --> 01:14:35,041
churches and I'd go and it was,
it was an uncomfortable thing to go to a

1531
01:14:35,561 --> 01:14:38,500
church where I'm pretty much the only
Chinese guy voting,

1532
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:41,680
you know,
a lot of people say really wild things

1533
01:14:41,681 --> 01:14:43,600
to you in mind.
Like when you're waiting to vote.

1534
01:14:43,601 --> 01:14:45,310
And I'm like,
I would have to vote online.

1535
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:49,540
Like when they say,
well you probably go on for the carry,

1536
01:14:49,541 --> 01:14:50,440
Huh?
You know what I mean?

1537
01:14:50,450 --> 01:14:55,450
Because it's like the John Kerry year
for carry and it's not your business

1538
01:14:55,781 --> 01:14:56,830
bro,
you know?

1539
01:14:56,890 --> 01:14:59,330
But also I'm like,
why do I have to go vote at a church?

1540
01:14:59,331 --> 01:15:02,740
Like I don't go to this church.
Peanut gets so intense when it comes to

1541
01:15:02,741 --> 01:15:06,730
voting comes struggle as are super
intense and you know,

1542
01:15:06,731 --> 01:15:07,331
they,
they,

1543
01:15:07,331 --> 01:15:09,190
you know,
people just say things to you in a

1544
01:15:09,191 --> 01:15:12,010
voting line and I'm like,
this discourages a lot of people that

1545
01:15:12,011 --> 01:15:14,140
may have a minority opinion in the
neighborhood.

1546
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:17,110
I think you should have some sort of an
understanding about what you're voting

1547
01:15:17,111 --> 01:15:17,944
for.
Two,

1548
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:20,800
I mean I,
I would like voting to be much easier,

1549
01:15:20,830 --> 01:15:24,070
but I would also like there to be some
accountability.

1550
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:26,960
Like you should know what you're
actually voting.

1551
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:30,880
Maybe there should be like some sort of
a quick online poll or some sort of a

1552
01:15:30,881 --> 01:15:35,881
quick online candidates.
I think that violates the constitution.

1553
01:15:36,821 --> 01:15:38,320
So I'm just going to say that does it.

1554
01:15:38,890 --> 01:15:40,480
The constitution has nothing to do with
the Internet.

1555
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:42,010
No,
nothing back then.

1556
01:15:42,011 --> 01:15:45,600
The constitutional meaning like old ass
shit.

1557
01:15:45,950 --> 01:15:49,180
I don't know.
I don't want to test for voting.

1558
01:15:49,181 --> 01:15:53,020
I think we're just expressing the
frustration where like a lot of people

1559
01:15:53,021 --> 01:15:56,160
just get ushered in like sheep to go
vote for people.

1560
01:15:56,190 --> 01:15:59,200
I think you're expressing that.
You want there to be accountability.

1561
01:15:59,230 --> 01:16:01,600
Yes.
And you want people to be aware,

1562
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:03,460
I would like people to know what they're
voting about.

1563
01:16:03,670 --> 01:16:06,670
Participation.
You could answer what your vote if you

1564
01:16:06,671 --> 01:16:08,110
understand it,
you know,

1565
01:16:08,111 --> 01:16:10,120
like maybe there's a,
some sort of,

1566
01:16:10,121 --> 01:16:12,520
uh,
an amendment that's being passed or

1567
01:16:12,521 --> 01:16:16,720
something's being passed where you don't
understand exactly what you're getting

1568
01:16:16,721 --> 01:16:21,721
into and maybe there should be a way
that we find out if you understand it,

1569
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:24,280
I know that you have the good intentions
for it.

1570
01:16:24,281 --> 01:16:28,330
But I read these cases that once you
have a test for people to vote,

1571
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,640
I mean the powers that be.

1572
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:32,590
I mean look at Gerrymandering,
you know,

1573
01:16:32,591 --> 01:16:35,430
like it's,
anytime you introduce that it,

1574
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:38,560
it always sets like the populace back.
But I do,

1575
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:43,360
I do really connect with joe sentiment,
which is like a lot of people voting

1576
01:16:43,361 --> 01:16:46,450
aren't,
aren't actually participating

1577
01:16:46,451 --> 01:16:48,180
consciously in the process.
Yeah.

1578
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:48,821
I mean,
listen,

1579
01:16:48,821 --> 01:16:53,821
I think being a citizens of job,
you actually spend some time and think

1580
01:16:54,491 --> 01:16:57,550
about what's your authorizing for the
world,

1581
01:16:57,551 --> 01:17:00,310
what the future's going to look like and
how you're going to participate in

1582
01:17:00,311 --> 01:17:04,360
shaping it merely by voting I think.
I think it's a real job and I think more

1583
01:17:04,361 --> 01:17:06,550
people are aware of that now than they
used to be.

1584
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:08,770
It's also,
there's so much to pay attention to.

1585
01:17:08,910 --> 01:17:12,290
It is every time lasting,
right is when the elections come around

1586
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:17,291
and you just realize all the different
things that are up and you just go over

1587
01:17:17,361 --> 01:17:20,780
all the different issues and all the
different possibilities and you're like,

1588
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:22,430
Oh God,
yeah,

1589
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:24,410
I know what I did in California last
time.

1590
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:26,040
Like all the propositions are like,
whoa,

1591
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:29,100
this is interesting.
I actually an interesting,

1592
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:33,440
but the local stuff is really important.
We spent so much time talking about

1593
01:17:33,441 --> 01:17:37,400
national elections,
people who around you who really have

1594
01:17:37,401 --> 01:17:42,401
power to change your life,
your most local representatives and

1595
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,610
sometimes I worry that we pay the least
amount of tension to those races.

1596
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,470
Oh yeah.
We dropped down the street and you see

1597
01:17:48,471 --> 01:17:52,100
some guys got a sign on his lawn for
some dude running for some shit you

1598
01:17:52,101 --> 01:17:53,300
didn't even know was up.
It was like,

1599
01:17:53,301 --> 01:17:57,650
is he a politician or a realtor?
How many people do they even need to win

1600
01:17:57,651 --> 01:17:59,420
one of those elections?
Yeah.

1601
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:01,130
That's where you start,
Eddie.

1602
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:04,070
That's where you start your empire.
San Gabriel Valley.

1603
01:18:04,071 --> 01:18:05,000
Yeah.
Before you run,

1604
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:09,200
you're the vice president with Oprah.
That's what you gotta do.

1605
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:10,340
I can't do it,
man.

1606
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:12,220
I can't do get a car.

1607
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:16,940
Everyone gets a
basic income.

1608
01:18:16,970 --> 01:18:19,970
Everyone is 60 g's 60.
That's what the universal.

1609
01:18:20,490 --> 01:18:21,980
If you can't get 30,
30,

1610
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:22,940
30,
32.

1611
01:18:22,941 --> 01:18:24,800
What we settled on was 30 last time.
Thirty.

1612
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:26,960
Thirty.
Seems like you could get by.

1613
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:28,040
Yeah.
Yeah.

1614
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:29,570
You're not going to get rich.
You're going to get by.

1615
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:30,740
Which is good.
Thirty five.

1616
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:35,560
I think 30 is a good place to start
trying it out in some place with 12 once

1617
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:39,910
a month to 50 a week.
Thirty is good with some like alright.

1618
01:18:39,950 --> 01:18:41,720
If you do get a job and you make some
money,

1619
01:18:41,730 --> 01:18:44,070
were you really paying some taxes?
You know?

1620
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:48,740
Interesting.
There was a way that automation is not

1621
01:18:48,741 --> 01:18:53,390
going to hit the economy at the same
time or all sectors of the economy at

1622
01:18:53,391 --> 01:18:58,280
the same time in the same way.
So I think it's coming faster than we

1623
01:18:58,281 --> 01:18:59,990
think.
Not that I'm wishing for this.

1624
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:04,190
I just think it it,
it is because my stocks and robotics

1625
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:07,400
keep going up that.
That's my evidence.

1626
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:09,910
Well,
Elon Musk is fairly convinced that

1627
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:11,780
universal basic incomes,
the way to go,

1628
01:19:12,170 --> 01:19:15,380
he thinks that in the future that's just
going to be inevitable because there's

1629
01:19:15,381 --> 01:19:16,940
going to be so many things that are
automated.

1630
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:18,680
Just can be so many people that are out
of work.

1631
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:21,320
Yeah.
Although I think it will change our

1632
01:19:21,321 --> 01:19:25,670
conception of work,
what we do to be productive individuals.

1633
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,070
People work too much.
That's for sure.

1634
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:30,860
I agree.
I think people would work way too much.

1635
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:32,960
You know what I mean?
You're live and then you're dead and you

1636
01:19:32,961 --> 01:19:35,780
have a heart attack when you're 60.
Is that really what we're doing?

1637
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:37,400
I mean,
isn't there a better way?

1638
01:19:37,430 --> 01:19:39,110
Well,
how about working three days a week,

1639
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:42,860
you know,
or four days a week for three off.

1640
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:45,110
Four on.
That seems reasonable.

1641
01:19:45,170 --> 01:19:48,020
I work seven,
but it's love so I don't feel like it's

1642
01:19:48,070 --> 01:19:49,790
work,
but none of my stuff actually.

1643
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:52,700
I mean,
how many days would you do the podcast?

1644
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,040
I do it a lot,
but I have other jobs.

1645
01:19:55,110 --> 01:19:58,100
Yeah.
You stand up and do the UFC commentary.

1646
01:19:58,101 --> 01:19:59,630
I do,
but none of them are jobs.

1647
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,250
Same.
This is barely.

1648
01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:02,920
I love it.
You know,

1649
01:20:02,990 --> 01:20:04,680
but also you're your own boss,
which is,

1650
01:20:04,830 --> 01:20:09,060
which makes work way different.
Makes it different things very different

1651
01:20:09,061 --> 01:20:10,750
than it is for most people.
Yes.

1652
01:20:11,010 --> 01:20:12,630
Yeah.
That's what I want most people to

1653
01:20:12,631 --> 01:20:15,330
escape.
I want them to escape the grind of

1654
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:19,890
having to be somewhere because someone
tells you have to have to do something

1655
01:20:19,891 --> 01:20:21,330
because someone tells you you have to do
it.

1656
01:20:21,390 --> 01:20:23,160
Yeah.
Getting a small amount of money.

1657
01:20:23,161 --> 01:20:26,760
Why other people make more?
I just think that the economy

1658
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:27,650
always changing.
I mean,

1659
01:20:27,651 --> 01:20:29,730
it used to be that you were,
um,

1660
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:33,170
there was an employer with many
employees.

1661
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,490
I think increasingly we're all gonna be,
um,

1662
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:41,590
the employee with many employers in that
we're going to have a web of contracts

1663
01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:46,880
and activities that we use to sustain
ourselves economically over time.

1664
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:51,530
I think you saw that developing the
Internet and the new platforms that are

1665
01:20:51,531 --> 01:20:53,170
coming on board.
Um,

1666
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:57,020
there's consequences of that for
healthcare and other issues that I don't

1667
01:20:57,021 --> 01:21:00,560
think we fully tackled.
But I think that there is change coming

1668
01:21:00,561 --> 01:21:04,670
that lifetime employment and preparing
for it with a single degree out of high

1669
01:21:04,671 --> 01:21:08,960
school is I think something that is
going to look like a historical moment

1670
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:10,750
in the future.
You know,

1671
01:21:10,751 --> 01:21:14,810
there's a johnny naysayers out there
that I always get frustrated by it.

1672
01:21:14,830 --> 01:21:15,760
They were like,
yeah man,

1673
01:21:15,761 --> 01:21:18,610
not everybody can do that.
Not everybody can work for themselves.

1674
01:21:18,611 --> 01:21:19,720
Not.
Guess what?

1675
01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:24,370
We're not talking to everybody.
If you're not capable,

1676
01:21:24,430 --> 01:21:26,260
that's okay.
But there's a lot of people out there

1677
01:21:26,261 --> 01:21:28,390
that are capable.
They just aren't doing it.

1678
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:29,650
Yeah,
they're scared.

1679
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:31,370
Yeah.
And they don't have to be.

1680
01:21:31,371 --> 01:21:34,990
Because we were all scared.
Everybody was scared and it seemed like

1681
01:21:35,470 --> 01:21:38,470
comfort and,
and,

1682
01:21:38,510 --> 01:21:41,320
and having some sort of security,
it's a real,

1683
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:44,740
a real need that a lot of people have
that confidence,

1684
01:21:44,741 --> 01:21:47,460
security and knowing that your bill is
going to be paid and everything's going

1685
01:21:47,461 --> 01:21:49,060
to be taken care of.
That's,

1686
01:21:49,090 --> 01:21:52,120
that's a,
that's hard for people to shake off.

1687
01:21:52,150 --> 01:21:54,040
Yeah.
Comfort is also a huge weakness.

1688
01:21:54,041 --> 01:21:55,870
I think at times,
like a lot of times,

1689
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:57,340
you know,
if you're too comfortable,

1690
01:21:57,341 --> 01:21:59,920
you become complacent,
like challenges,

1691
01:21:59,921 --> 01:22:02,440
failures,
like that's where I really start to

1692
01:22:02,441 --> 01:22:05,110
examine myself and I'm like,
it might be better tomorrow.

1693
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:07,540
Growth in comfort.
Don't go together.

1694
01:22:07,570 --> 01:22:08,403
Yeah,
yeah.

1695
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:10,090
Um,
for anybody.

1696
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:12,340
Yeah.
But then people get families and then

1697
01:22:12,341 --> 01:22:14,140
when you get families you don't want to
take any risks.

1698
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:16,870
That's,
that's a problem as well.

1699
01:22:16,930 --> 01:22:19,130
People have mortgages and children and
they,

1700
01:22:19,131 --> 01:22:22,930
they don't want to do anything that
might put them in the unemployment line.

1701
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:25,450
To be clear.
That can be a really smart and

1702
01:22:25,451 --> 01:22:29,110
responsible choice at some point when
you have a lot of people relying on you,

1703
01:22:29,650 --> 01:22:31,500
that's the most rational thing do.

1704
01:22:32,270 --> 01:22:33,230
Yeah.
That's a real problem.

1705
01:22:33,530 --> 01:22:35,720
Like a Black Jack Dealer told me last
week,

1706
01:22:35,721 --> 01:22:37,010
scared money,
don't make money.

1707
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:40,640
You say I go try and double down,
double down,

1708
01:22:40,670 --> 01:22:42,050
double down.
I'm showing a four.

1709
01:22:42,110 --> 01:22:44,170
How did that bag?
He pulled a seven.

1710
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:47,630
I got screwed because that's why you go
to Vegas.

1711
01:22:47,631 --> 01:22:48,321
I told them,
I was like,

1712
01:22:48,321 --> 01:22:51,320
this is why come to vegas to lose money.
Well,

1713
01:22:51,330 --> 01:22:51,960
yeah.
Well,

1714
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:56,870
yeah.
And you lose money and I had to tell

1715
01:22:56,871 --> 01:22:59,270
everyone at the table's,
I'm like professional gambling,

1716
01:22:59,271 --> 01:23:00,830
that's what we're here for.
Like if you,

1717
01:23:00,831 --> 01:23:05,831
if you hit on 17 then always hit on 70.
If you hit on 16 then or if you stay on

1718
01:23:06,071 --> 01:23:09,010
16 stout 16.
Bromley plus practice professional

1719
01:23:09,011 --> 01:23:12,790
gambling professional gambling's not on
17 though.

1720
01:23:12,791 --> 01:23:15,050
Right?
That's if they're showing,

1721
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:17,800
they're showing like if they're showing
a face card,

1722
01:23:17,801 --> 01:23:18,820
some people hit.
I mean,

1723
01:23:18,821 --> 01:23:19,480
no,
not 70.

1724
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:20,470
What I was saying.
16.

1725
01:23:20,770 --> 01:23:22,540
I'm at 16.
I said the wrong thing.

1726
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:26,590
Like I always stay on 16.
Even if they're showing a face card,

1727
01:23:26,591 --> 01:23:28,540
I'm like I just stay on 16.
Really?

1728
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:31,090
Yeah.
I'm conservative but then I'll double

1729
01:23:31,091 --> 01:23:32,480
down.
Double down.

1730
01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:34,510
You have the,
the hit on 17.

1731
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:39,040
That's those wild white people you were
talking to are the people we need you to

1732
01:23:39,041 --> 01:23:42,580
turn there listening.
Cowboys.

1733
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:44,170
People listen.
They're listening.

1734
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:45,183
Yeah.
Uh.

1735
01:23:45,210 --> 01:23:47,290
All right.
I guess we probably should wrap this up.

1736
01:23:47,291 --> 01:23:50,230
Jessica,
tell everybody what your um,

1737
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:53,790
your twitter handle is [inaudible].
It's J.

1738
01:23:53,790 --> 01:23:55,130
Rosenworcel.
Spell my

1739
01:23:57,330 --> 01:23:58,690
last name.
Uh,

1740
01:23:58,790 --> 01:24:03,790
so that's at j.
r o s e n w o r c e l and m.

1741
01:24:05,770 --> 01:24:10,060
So your advice is people should do the
old fashioned thing.

1742
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:14,800
Make those phone calls.
My advice is make a Ruckus make rocking

1743
01:24:16,090 --> 01:24:19,690
without a little noise.
This is one of those times and I think

1744
01:24:19,691 --> 01:24:22,270
being a citizen requires us all to speak
up right now.

1745
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:24,940
Make a Ruckus online as well.
Let people know.

1746
01:24:24,941 --> 01:24:26,590
And your social media,
your facebook,

1747
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:27,850
twitter,
all that jazz.

1748
01:24:28,490 --> 01:24:31,690
And getting the pornhub comments.
Hashtag that neutrality.

1749
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,490
Yeah,
that's not what she says.

1750
01:24:33,491 --> 01:24:36,430
What I said,
I can't believe you leave comments.

1751
01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:38,950
I can't believe I know somebody leaves
comments.

1752
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:40,070
So,
um,

1753
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:44,080
uh,
Mr. Eddie Wong on twitter and instagram

1754
01:24:44,081 --> 01:24:44,920
as well.
Same thing.

1755
01:24:44,921 --> 01:24:46,960
Same thing man.
Thank you brother.

1756
01:24:46,961 --> 01:24:48,790
Thanks for putting this together.
I really appreciate it.

1757
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:51,070
It's very important when people talk
about this stuff.

1758
01:24:51,310 --> 01:24:52,960
Thank you Jessica for being here.
Appreciate it.

1759
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:54,730
And thank you everybody for listening.
All right,

1760
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:55,420
thanks Joe.
