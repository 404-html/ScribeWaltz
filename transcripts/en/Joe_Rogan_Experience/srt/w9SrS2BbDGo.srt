1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,290
I know that,
I know,

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,570
I know,
I'm just saying it's fucking.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,040
I mean they fuck up all the time.
It's brutal,

4
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:11,130
but it's always live on it.
Always goes to itunes in the unedited 

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:11,500
forum.
We just have to reboot it.

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,690
It's back up now.
Okay.

7
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,290
Um,
so where were you,

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,760
um,
natural disasters,

9
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,180
natural disasters?
So I think what we're,

10
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:19,860
you know,
it's,

11
00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:22,280
it's basically we can see where we're 
going right at the moment.

12
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:24,950
There's more and more natural disasters 
coming faster and faster.

13
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,220
Some of that may be because of the fact 
that we're going through a whole solar 

14
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,210
system wide transition as scientists 
like Dimitria from Russia talks about in

15
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:37,211
this guy dieter borrows,
some of it may be because the level of 

16
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:41,261
human consciousness is more meshed with 
the natural state of the planet than we 

17
00:00:41,571 --> 00:00:46,571
actually can comprehend quite yet,
which is what most of the indigenous 

18
00:00:46,571 --> 00:00:46,571
people believe.
And I've been visiting,

19
00:00:46,571 --> 00:00:51,051
like we've been doing retreats down in 
Columbia to work with the Kogi Indians 

20
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,430
and they walk like 25 hours down from 
the mountains to hang out with us.

21
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,920
And that's basically the message that 
they've been giving us from,

22
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:59,921
from their,
from their older understanding of the 

23
00:00:59,921 --> 00:01:01,170
nature of reality,
you know,

24
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:06,171
it's somehow the level of human 
spiritual development and how much we 

25
00:01:06,171 --> 00:01:09,170
are in a reciprocal relationship to our 
local world,

26
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,450
you know,
has an effect on what type of 

27
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:14,810
catastrophe is,
do or don't occur.

28
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:15,950
That's their perspective.

29
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,050
So,
uh,

30
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,090
when the earth is sick,
it's because we're sick and we're all 

31
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,991
sick along with it.
So as tsunamis and hurricanes and 

32
00:01:26,991 --> 00:01:31,340
earthquakes and ultimately shifts in the
polar ice caps and shit like that,

33
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:35,760
and super volcanoes and yellowstone that
are ready to blow and kill half the shit

34
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:40,761
on the continent that,
that is all in correspondence with the 

35
00:01:40,761 --> 00:01:42,200
sickness of this species of us.
That's,

36
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,180
that's the indigenous perspective.
Tam.

37
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,930
That's a scary thought.
But listen,

38
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:50,931
man,
if we look at the ideas of quantum 

39
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:53,301
physics that even observing something 
with certain intentions can actually 

40
00:01:53,301 --> 00:01:54,120
change the outcome of particles.
You know,

41
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:56,460
when they do those tests,
those slot tests,

42
00:01:56,461 --> 00:02:01,461
and they show that observing and 
experiments actually observing 

43
00:02:01,461 --> 00:02:02,570
experience actually has an effect on the
result of the experiment.

44
00:02:02,571 --> 00:02:07,571
Or,
or you could say there's no such thing 

45
00:02:07,571 --> 00:02:07,760
as just being an impartial observer.
You're always participating in,

46
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,810
in the outcome.
That's a better way of looking at it.

47
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,550
It really does make sense that it,
it,

48
00:02:12,551 --> 00:02:15,750
it operates on macro micro and 
ultimately,

49
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,940
you know,
this one gigantic level,

50
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:23,090
right?
Which is what like Western alchemists 

51
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,090
talk about when they said as above,
so below

52
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,270
fucking crazy.
Is it the idea that human behavior can 

53
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,190
actually inspire storms?
You know,

54
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,110
you don't want to say that because you 
don't want to say that.

55
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:34,660
Like the most fucked up places.
The places get the storms,

56
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,900
but I used to do jokes about it.
They're cruel jokes that I would never 

57
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,721
do now,
but I just do jokes about how tornadoes 

58
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:42,940
were attracted to the smell of white 
trash.

59
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,850
They just circle when you have too much 
macaroni and cheese and,

60
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,160
and 40 ounce beer in one location,
but it's a terrible idea.

61
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,400
There's a terrible joke.
It's,

62
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:57,401
it's really cruel to think that you're 
cooler than these fucking poor people 

63
00:02:57,401 --> 00:02:58,900
that live in some place where the sky 
becomes an angry monster.

64
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,040
But it is kind of

65
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,440
weird that they only landed fucked up 
places.

66
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,040
You don't want to think that,
you know everyone to blame people for 

67
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,040
that.
But wow.

68
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,770
You know,
I mean obviously we know that's not true

69
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:13,771
because there's geographic centers in 
this country where there's certainly 

70
00:03:13,771 --> 00:03:13,771
attracted to,
you know,

71
00:03:13,771 --> 00:03:18,540
but the idea that more of them come 
because people are more fucked up and 

72
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,140
they're accelerating because our society
is deteriorating.

73
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,900
That's a terrifying thought that we're 
responsible for that.

74
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,680
Well,
or,

75
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,380
or even on a one percent level even 
that,

76
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,600
that we're responsible for just having 
any influence on it.

77
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:36,601
Not that we created,
but that we even have any barriers as I 

78
00:03:36,601 --> 00:03:39,160
discussed in like the 2012 book.
Like the Hopi for instance,

79
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:44,161
who live in Arizona,
tribes like that may have actually 

80
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:47,041
chosen to live in very difficult 
environments where survival is really 

81
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:51,061
like on a knife edge because it forced 
them to be able to do things like rain 

82
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:51,910
dances.

83
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,770
So they did it on purpose or do you 
think that it.

84
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,960
Is that in or is it that is the result 
of them living in this difficult 

85
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,750
environment and develop more character?
Well,

86
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:06,751
it's quite possible because they had a 
large choice earlier on of where they 

87
00:04:06,751 --> 00:04:08,170
were going to leave and it's possible 
they actually chose to leave and live in

88
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:13,171
very difficult environments because it 
forced them to develop their initiatory 

89
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:16,201
and psychic capacity.
The only reason why I'm questioned that 

90
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:18,371
is because back then the resources were 
so scarce and you were on foot 

91
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:19,000
essentially,
so if you were on foot,

92
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:24,001
how much fucking ground can you cover 
and how much do you know about other 

93
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:24,001
lands?
You know?

94
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:26,050
How much do you know about if you move 
five hours south doesn't get that cold.

95
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:27,290
You don't fucking know that.
Actually,

96
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,130
I totally disagree with what you're 
saying on both levels.

97
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,540
First of all,
I think that they did.

98
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:32,320
No,
I mean for instance,

99
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:34,330
we now understand that there was like a 
sign language.

100
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:38,920
Even native people who didn't speak the 
same language could actually communicate

101
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:40,460
with very highly developed sign 
language.

102
00:04:40,461 --> 00:04:42,700
There was all across the continent and 
second of all,

103
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:47,730
what they've discovered is that a lot of
native cultures were actually more like 

104
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,550
cultures of abundance and cultures of 
scarcity that actually the amount of 

105
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:50,940
work that they had to do today though,
you know,

106
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,990
compared to what we have to do know an 
average day,

107
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:55,360
it was a lot less than.
But that doesn't make match up with your

108
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:58,720
idea of them moving to a very difficult 
environment to stay alive.

109
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:00,610
Because I'm talking about the hope in 
particular,

110
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:01,380
let's say like,
yeah,

111
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,570
they were like the Tibetan Buddhists of 
the native people,

112
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,900
they chose the most difficult spot.
What they state this anywhere as is just

113
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:11,590
a conclusion or a feeling you have.

114
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,490
No,
it's a theory.

115
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,660
It's a theory.
I mean,

116
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:14,800
you know,
maybe it's ludicrous,

117
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,250
but,
but,

118
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:16,290
um,
uh,

119
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,300
it was just inside my visited them for 
the book and I read a lot about them 

120
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,971
anthropological accounts and so on.
But the whole thing is they would put 

121
00:05:23,971 --> 00:05:24,130
themselves through these extraordinary,
uh,

122
00:05:24,131 --> 00:05:24,940
you know,
uh,

123
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,720
you know,
kind of,

124
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:26,890
uh,
efforts,

125
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:27,360
you know,
the,

126
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:32,410
the Hopi snake clan.
They would go all around the area that 

127
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,700
we collect all of the most poisonous 
snakes they could possibly find.

128
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,170
Then the men would sit,
you know,

129
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:37,540
just naked wearing,
going kloss in a circle with their knees

130
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:42,541
touching.
They would open up all of the snakes in 

131
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,241
the middle of the circle and the men 
would have to sit entirely still until 

132
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:47,110
all of the snakes had crawled past them.
Wow.

133
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,550
That's pretty fucking wild,
right?

134
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:56,551
They definitely,
definitely had their shit together when 

135
00:05:56,551 --> 00:05:56,551
it came to rites of passage.
You know,

136
00:05:56,551 --> 00:05:57,980
I remember that movie the,
a man called horse.

137
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,500
Do you remember that night incident?
It was a,

138
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,540
it was a,
um,

139
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,050
I forget the guy's name,
the.

140
00:06:02,051 --> 00:06:05,630
He played the father in a gladiator.
Peter O'toole,

141
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,520
I believe it's Peter O'toole.
I might be incorrect.

142
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,680
Anyway,
amazing fucking movie.

143
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:14,681
But one of the scariest parts of it is 
one of these rights of passage that he 

144
00:06:14,681 --> 00:06:17,831
has in order to become one with their 
tribes and American or a be an 

145
00:06:17,831 --> 00:06:18,000
Englishman.
I forget the fucking bills,

146
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,360
but they hung him by his nipples.
You know,

147
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:22,100
they used to do shit to test you.

148
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:22,900
Oh,
there's are the,

149
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,350
the sun dances,
they put the,

150
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:25,640
they lance you through the,
uh,

151
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:29,600
the pectoral muscles hang you up.
Really.

152
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,490
Is that necessary?
Apparently,

153
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:36,491
yes.
It's the Indian equivalent of about 

154
00:06:36,491 --> 00:06:40,540
teeth straightening I guess,
or botox ingestion or an injection or 

155
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:40,540
something.
Oh,

156
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,540
it's way worse than that.
Are Way better than

157
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,750
rather it's um,
I think,

158
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:48,751
you know,
just having something like having a bar 

159
00:06:48,751 --> 00:06:49,210
Mitzvah,
having some sort of a celebration.

160
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,490
It doesn't even have to be,
you know,

161
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,860
you're hung from a tree by your tits.
It just has to be something where like,

162
00:06:53,861 --> 00:06:54,550
okay,
I,

163
00:06:54,551 --> 00:06:55,990
I pass through the door.

164
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,120
Well,
it's a symbolic.

165
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,850
That's actually what you're saying.
For me it was like a big distinction for

166
00:06:59,851 --> 00:07:04,851
those cultures.
Initiation was actually about going 

167
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:08,391
through some process through which you 
would master non ordinary states of 

168
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:09,550
consciousness.
You mean on what would cultures,

169
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,880
the native cultures.
I mean,

170
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,190
initiation was not just a celebration.
You actually had to overcome,

171
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,680
you know,
a life death crisis yet

172
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,610
warrior for them too.
I mean,

173
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,680
you're in a constant state of,
you know,

174
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,360
defending your tribes and you know,
you were,

175
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:28,570
you had to be able to overcome very,
very terrifying situations even in 

176
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,920
hunting.
You know,

177
00:07:29,921 --> 00:07:31,360
they had a makeup man out of you.

178
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,470
Yeah.
But,

179
00:07:32,471 --> 00:07:37,471
but I,
but I think that a lot of it was really 

180
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,521
more about learning to have a 
disciplined approach to non ordinary 

181
00:07:39,521 --> 00:07:41,990
states of states of consciousness to 
control states of consciousness.

182
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,050
I mean,
what do you mean by non ordinary to mean

183
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,010
like pod enhanced?
What do you,

184
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:50,780
I mean obviously pod mushrooms and these
are all native Ios Osca and so on.

185
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:53,540
But then also things like fasting,
you know,

186
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:54,170
and being,
you know,

187
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:59,171
not eating for five nights where you're 
just sitting on a mountain top or 

188
00:07:59,171 --> 00:08:02,381
something or what's the benefit of that?
It's both exactly puts you in exactly 

189
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:05,210
the same kind of state as the 
psychoactive substances.

190
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:09,040
Five fasting for five days.
Those will bring on a visionary,

191
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,880
visionary experiences,
you know,

192
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:11,670
they were,
and,

193
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,550
and force you to,
you know,

194
00:08:13,551 --> 00:08:16,260
discipline your mind,
be able to withstand,

195
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:22,090
you know,
ingression this from like the astral 

196
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:22,090
realms.
And so on,

197
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:25,650
what do you say to people that say that 
doing something along the lines of 

198
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:26,200
fasting where it's actually possibly 
dangerous to your body and that's what's

199
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:31,201
causing you to have these experiences.
It's really kind of a silly thing to do 

200
00:08:31,201 --> 00:08:34,261
in this day and age where you could 
choose other paths to the same sort of 

201
00:08:34,261 --> 00:08:35,230
results without damaging your body and 
shutting things down.

202
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:38,320
I don't know enough about nutrition to 
tell you whether or not it's healthy,

203
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,590
but I've read a lot of people that start
talking about fasting for days and days,

204
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:43,090
days and they say it puts strain on you.

205
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,410
It's not good for you.
I mean,

206
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,320
I don't know.
No,

207
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,860
I wouldn't say it's not good for you to 
not eat.

208
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,890
It probably isn't.
I don't know.

209
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,620
I know I didn't know a lot of people who
love it and find it to be very helpful.

210
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,600
That actually one of them in terms of 
extending the human lifespan,

211
00:08:57,601 --> 00:08:58,740
they found that,
you know,

212
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:00,390
reducing your caloric intake is,
is,

213
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:02,160
is the most direct way to do it.

214
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,230
Does that make sense?
To just.

215
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,890
Your body's going at less Rpms,
you know,

216
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,110
a,
a race engines,

217
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,740
not gonna,
not going to last as long.

218
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,250
There's a good episode of Penn and 
Teller Bullshit.

219
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,810
Look at the cleansing episode where they
go through like the the diets,

220
00:09:16,811 --> 00:09:20,350
like the lemon detox diets and shit like
that where you don't eat the officer,

221
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,540
go through the colonics and the whole 
thing like that.

222
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,610
That the whole thing is,
it's a crock.

223
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,020
Shantelle is bullshit.
Make some excellent points,

224
00:09:27,021 --> 00:09:28,910
but they also make some silly ones 
because they.

225
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,510
They want to find the conclusion that 
everything is bullshit.

226
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:35,630
That's what they're doing.
I don't think they dismiss yoga.

227
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,610
I watched them dismiss Yoga.
We're just talking about.

228
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,560
It's just stretching and stretching and 
I was like,

229
00:09:39,561 --> 00:09:40,310
wow,
you're crazy.

230
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:43,760
You've never done a yoga class.
If you do yoga for two hours and tell me

231
00:09:43,761 --> 00:09:47,600
that's just stretching.
Yoga makes you hot.

232
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,340
Yoga makes you.
I've,

233
00:09:49,341 --> 00:09:52,790
I've gotten is high from yoga as I have 
from a couple of hits of pot.

234
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,830
No doubt about it.
No doubt.

235
00:09:54,831 --> 00:09:59,831
Like real strong pot.
I've gotten to like body tingling 

236
00:09:59,831 --> 00:10:03,821
moments.
Like especially if you take like a real 

237
00:10:03,821 --> 00:10:05,771
good class,
like hot yoga where you go real deep 

238
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,891
into poses and you really hold them.
Anybody that dismisses that as just 

239
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:12,971
stretching,
you're either not giving me the full 

240
00:10:12,971 --> 00:10:16,361
information that you have access to or 
you did a really sloppy job of 

241
00:10:16,361 --> 00:10:16,361
investigating it,
you know,

242
00:10:16,361 --> 00:10:21,270
you can't just say these fucking Indian 
masters that had been doing this shit 

243
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:25,331
for thousands of years or just 
stretching and that's why they have 

244
00:10:25,331 --> 00:10:28,421
these very specific poses that they 
believe activate very specific regions 

245
00:10:28,851 --> 00:10:31,430
in the hemispheres of the,
of the Chakras of the body.

246
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,560
You can't just dismiss that a

247
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,920
cat if you want.
I mean,

248
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:41,310
that's what's so a kind of interesting 
and cool about what's happening right 

249
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:41,800
now and how things are so complex.
I mean,

250
00:10:41,801 --> 00:10:42,310
yeah,
I mean,

251
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:47,790
you know,
I mean I was looking at a book by this 

252
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:47,790
guy,
Dean Raden,

253
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,760
who studies a psychic phenomena as a 
scientist that incident noetic sciences 

254
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,970
and we interviewed for a film or read a 
book called the Self Aware Universe and 

255
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,640
he analyzes a whole century's worth of 
data and psychic experience experience.

256
00:10:57,641 --> 00:11:02,641
Statistically.
He even looks at reports from the US 

257
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:04,480
army and the government which support 
the existence of psychic phenomena,

258
00:11:04,481 --> 00:11:09,481
of non local communication mind to mind,
which means that consciousness is not 

259
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:11,650
simply brain-based that exist in a 
different way now.

260
00:11:11,651 --> 00:11:15,340
But I've also read recently this book by
Richard Wiseman called Para normality,

261
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,530
who believes there was no psychic 
phenomena,

262
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,230
you know,
busts every evidence for it,

263
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:20,980
you know,
and,

264
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:23,950
and in his own way is quite convincing,
you know,

265
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:24,400
so,
so,

266
00:11:24,401 --> 00:11:25,690
so for me it's,
it's,

267
00:11:25,691 --> 00:11:30,691
um,
it's just makes it a very interesting 

268
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:30,691
time,
you know,

269
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:34,320
where you can approach anything and 
analytically rip it apart and find the 

270
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,390
weak spots.
But,

271
00:11:35,391 --> 00:11:36,370
but maybe what,
uh,

272
00:11:36,371 --> 00:11:41,371
what's missing from Penn and teller and 
Richard Wiseman's understanding is the 

273
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:45,691
sense that a intention is somehow a 
fundamental aspect of the universe,

274
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:46,530
you know,
so,

275
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:49,210
so if your intention is to,
you know,

276
00:11:49,211 --> 00:11:51,010
take something apart,
desecrated,

277
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:52,070
ignore it,
you know,

278
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,190
and so on,
you can do of that for sure.

279
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,330
You know,
but,

280
00:11:55,331 --> 00:11:56,560
um,
but,

281
00:11:56,561 --> 00:12:01,561
but within there you've kind of missed a
subtle key that actually makes a life 

282
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:03,760
worth having in a way.
Well,

283
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:08,761
intention is aware and you can be aware 
of it in a very tangible form in the art

284
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:14,011
of standup comedy.
It's you cannot be thinking about 

285
00:12:14,011 --> 00:12:17,521
something different.
Say something else and have the people 

286
00:12:17,521 --> 00:12:17,521
react to it.
They won't.

287
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,600
It won't work.
It's a weird thing.

288
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,910
You could have the joke worded 
correctly.

289
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,040
You could say it with the right 
intonation you get,

290
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,210
but if your mind is an intuit,
they can smell it.

291
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:30,880
It's the weirdest fucking thing in the 
world.

292
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,520
The a connection that you have with an 
audience.

293
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:36,510
It could be an audience of 200 or it can
be an audience of a thousand.

294
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,720
If you've reached that full connection,
it is like a giant mass hypnosis.

295
00:12:40,721 --> 00:12:45,721
There is some sort of a relationship 
that you had with these people and if 

296
00:12:45,721 --> 00:12:49,081
somehow or another something hits you,
you remember something or something 

297
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:53,580
bothers you or you think about an 
argument that you got in with your 

298
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,450
girlfriend or a bill,
you forgot to pay her.

299
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,400
Any distraction that makes you feel in a
negative way.

300
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,590
Even if you're saying the words the same
night,

301
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:03,400
the audience will feel it.
They will feel it and they will back off

302
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:04,510
you.
You can feel it.

303
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,960
You could feel them go.
He's not,

304
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:09,010
he's not engaged.
It's a religion man.

305
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:11,320
It's real.
You can't tell me it's not.

306
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,360
I've always said that,
you know,

307
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:15,160
I do my best to,
uh,

308
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,680
write standup.
I sit down,

309
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,070
I do my best to put in the time to be 
there to make the writing happen,

310
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,280
and I do in the time when I perform 
enough so that I get onstage that I'm 

311
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,210
really comfortable and relaxed.
But ultimately at the end of the day,

312
00:13:28,211 --> 00:13:31,210
I'm not exactly sure how that shit is 
even coming out.

313
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,480
I don't know where it's coming from.
I don't know what's happening and when 

314
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:36,880
I'm on stage,
when I'm completely locked in,

315
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,960
I am as much a passenger as I am the 
person who steers it.

316
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:46,230
And as long as that works,
as long as I'm in that groove and the 

317
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,520
audiences in that group,
the whole thing will go seamlessly.

318
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,820
But one little hiccup,
one little bad thought,

319
00:13:51,821 --> 00:13:55,030
one little error,
one little stress point,

320
00:13:55,090 --> 00:14:00,090
and everybody hops off the the,
the bride and weights and looks at you 

321
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:04,170
and goes,
you're going to get this thing going 

322
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:04,170
again.
And Yeah,

323
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:04,170
get back in.
Everybody gets back in,

324
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:04,330
we're okay.
We're okay.

325
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,450
Do you know what you're doing now?
I know what I'm doing now they can tell.

326
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,540
And that's a psychic connection.
That's a legit tangible,

327
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,640
psychic connection that when you're on 
stage,

328
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:17,641
you feel it from the crowd.
You feel like waves of positive and 

329
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:20,521
negative.
You literally feel the energy and you 

330
00:14:20,521 --> 00:14:20,521
can say that,
right?

331
00:14:20,521 --> 00:14:24,120
You've said you've had really good sets 
on stage and you've had jokes that 

332
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,600
bombed and you've met people angry at 
you.

333
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,590
You felt that,
right?

334
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:28,210
Don't you feel it like a wave?

335
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,070
It,
it,

336
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,330
it,
it affects you.

337
00:14:30,331 --> 00:14:32,580
Just like anything like getting hit by a
snowball.

338
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:36,210
You know,
like if you got a bad joke on state,

339
00:14:36,211 --> 00:14:37,470
if you got,
that's the worst.

340
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,920
If he had a bad joke on stage,
but uh,

341
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:43,530
and it would hit you before you were 
like having a great day.

342
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,080
After that you're,
you're having the worst day ever.

343
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,170
You just got hit in the face with 
Villanova.

344
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,730
You life is the exact same life.
Literally.

345
00:14:50,731 --> 00:14:52,280
None of the hard details

346
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,980
have changed and yet you feel you 
fucking loser,

347
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,140
you know,
because these people have let you know,

348
00:14:57,141 --> 00:15:02,141
you have not given us what we want.
Is this weird sort of an exchange that's

349
00:15:02,331 --> 00:15:07,331
going on because I haven't had no.
CIS and Trans are things that are 

350
00:15:07,331 --> 00:15:08,490
operating like much of the time,
you know.

351
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,550
Have you ever watched a massive doses 
show?

352
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,450
Yeah,
I did watch my college one,

353
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,990
so thanks.
Sorry.

354
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,370
They used to have them all the time in 
Boston at the,

355
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:24,371
um,
there's a place called the comedy 

356
00:15:24,371 --> 00:15:24,371
connection.
Every week they had this guy,

357
00:15:24,371 --> 00:15:27,821
Frank Santos,
who would do a hypnotist comedy show 

358
00:15:27,821 --> 00:15:30,080
that seemed like bullshit until you saw 
it a few times.

359
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,760
And when you saw it a few times you 
would realize,

360
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:33,710
oh my God,
these people are really fucking under.

361
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,780
It's so weird.
And not everybody,

362
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,840
he would know,
he would go up to the people that 

363
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:40,840
weren't and he'd look at them and go,
okay,

364
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:40,840
you get off the stage when he pulled the
people off the stage.

365
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,680
But the people that were up there,
for whatever reason,

366
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,120
he found their,
their,

367
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:49,121
their hack code and got into their food.
I tend to look at most of our 

368
00:15:49,121 --> 00:15:50,060
politicians and uh,
you know,

369
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:55,090
news anchors is kind of a illuminati 
sorcerers who use a transit gnosis to 

370
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:55,860
keep people in a,
in a,

371
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,910
in a lower state of consciousness,
loaded state of suggestibility,

372
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,320
Illuminati.
I hate black wizards.

373
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:07,970
He got,
he got robbed by a black wizard guy 

374
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:08,900
dressed up like a wizard,
put a gun in his chest,

375
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,070
sort of guide a fake beard on.
So he called them black wizard

376
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,110
socks.
Man,

377
00:16:14,111 --> 00:16:18,060
there's this guy at my starbucks and I 
feel so bad for him because he,

378
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:22,270
he totally reminds me of him,
that guy that robbed me.

379
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,520
And every time I fucking walk in there,
I'm just like,

380
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:26,830
damn,
I'm fucking totally just eyeing this guy

381
00:16:26,831 --> 00:16:31,831
more than I normally would.
I somebody waiting in line and I'll just

382
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:33,190
be like,
what's that guy doing?

383
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,260
Like a dog that used to bite you?
Yeah,

384
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,520
exactly.
And He,

385
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,320
I've caught eyes with them like three 
times.

386
00:16:38,321 --> 00:16:41,710
I feel so fucking bad about this.
I might have to switch starbucks because

387
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:43,070
of it.
Just switched to our bugs.

388
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:43,870
Yeah,
I'll just do that.

389
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,500
Just,
you know,

390
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,820
I was Kinda mad.
Yeah.

391
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,940
But then he's like,
he's kicking me out of the starbucks.

392
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:49,330
You know,
what,

393
00:16:49,331 --> 00:16:53,830
if it is him to the idea that you 
somehow or another manifestation

394
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,150
that is where things get really spooky,
you know,

395
00:16:56,151 --> 00:17:01,151
the people that believe that you 
manifest every single action in your 

396
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:02,690
life and that you have some sort of 
alternative that really you,

397
00:17:02,691 --> 00:17:03,680
it's more like the,
uh,

398
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:09,260
I liked the Vedanta perspective of the.
Basically there's like a singular 

399
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:09,260
consciousness,
you know,

400
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:09,270
we're kind of like,
you know,

401
00:17:09,271 --> 00:17:10,580
we're,
we're part of the projection,

402
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,750
okay,
what,

403
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,910
what is the way?
If that is the case,

404
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,760
how can I avoid some horrible bullshit 
in my life?

405
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:22,390
Can I just have to do the right thing 
and be super nice and always go in a 

406
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:26,231
positive direction and you can't draw 
like I'm starting to think that you 

407
00:17:26,231 --> 00:17:31,151
can't control if you can't afford it,
just ignore it or what's the bullshit 

408
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:31,151
that you can't ignore?
Oh,

409
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:31,930
well,
just a like life,

410
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,920
life and death.
People for whatever,

411
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,510
for whatever

412
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,880
right now in all my life,
for whatever reason right now,

413
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:42,881
the last year to two years in my life 
have been the most psychotic and crazy,

414
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,060
but yet I've also been paused.
Please,

415
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,020
please pause.
Please.

416
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,750
The most successful place

417
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,160
he's been dating porn stars.
Okay?

418
00:17:53,161 --> 00:17:54,090
What the fuck man.

419
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,360
Already know what I'm saying.
I also want what I'm saying.

420
00:17:56,361 --> 00:17:59,570
Dog fucking die.
I've also got mugged at gun.

421
00:17:59,571 --> 00:18:04,250
I've also fucking a million other things
that lately that has been happening that

422
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:07,850
in my whole life never has.
My life has been boring as fuck.

423
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:12,970
You know,
and now I'm having horrible things 

424
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:13,550
happen to me at the same time as I'm 
having the best time of my life.

425
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,260
Well,
you know,

426
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,870
maybe that maybe there's something wrong
in the formula of how you're interacting

427
00:18:18,871 --> 00:18:21,270
with the grid.
Maybe there's something wrong.

428
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,160
What if you had to look,
forget it.

429
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,240
Forget it.
Forget your life.

430
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,950
Put it away.
You're not even you.

431
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,870
If you had to look at how many people 
were taking a lot of people,

432
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,900
that's how the government spends money.
Hopefully not one of my friends I've 

433
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:35,900
got.
Please hold

434
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,310
place if you were not you.
Okay.

435
00:18:37,311 --> 00:18:39,650
Forget about the emotional attachment 
that you have all day.

436
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,660
All your issues.
How would you fix you?

437
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,210
What would you say?
You know,

438
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,180
the one thing that we would like to 
correct about Brian would be x.

439
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,030
What would it be?
What's the number one thing?

440
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:50,380
Yeah.
If you had,

441
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,760
if you could,
instead of working at something,

442
00:18:52,761 --> 00:18:54,800
if you could just correct something 
about your behavior,

443
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,860
the way you think about things or the 
way you look at the world or anything.

444
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,580
What would it be?

445
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,890
Uh,
did not throw.

446
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,300
Come on walls.
Okay.

447
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,190
What if you just stopped doing?
I really don't.

448
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:10,560
I really don't.
Like I never think you don't believe 

449
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,470
that any of you on myself.
I don't feel like I have any flaws.

450
00:19:12,471 --> 00:19:13,800
I don't overthink it.
My,

451
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:14,960
my,
my personal.

452
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:15,710
This is what I'm trying to

453
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,840
gets it.
This is what I'm trying to get to.

454
00:19:16,841 --> 00:19:18,760
I don't know if it's either or.
I don't know.

455
00:19:18,761 --> 00:19:23,761
If you look,
there's babies that are killed in drive 

456
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:24,100
bys and when I hear about that I go,
well that doesn't know how the fuck does

457
00:19:24,101 --> 00:19:25,750
that work?
What's going on there?

458
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,140
He knows the baby.
Have some negative thoughts that haven't

459
00:19:29,141 --> 00:19:34,141
been.
Then I think about it and I think about 

460
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:34,141
all the positive things that have 
happened in my life and all the positive

461
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:39,031
things that I know have manifested 
themselves through a certain type of 

462
00:19:39,031 --> 00:19:39,220
thinking,
a certain ethic,

463
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:44,221
a certain way of looking at the world 
and I wonder if it is either or or if 

464
00:19:44,221 --> 00:19:46,390
it's a combination of things.
You know what I'm saying?

465
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:47,470
Daniel?

466
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,570
I like tuned that for a second.
Sorry.

467
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,170
I just personally think that I'm trying 
to kill.

468
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:02,050
The only choice we ever have is to look 
at the bright side of the or the crappy 

469
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:05,281
side.
So why not just always look at the 

470
00:20:05,281 --> 00:20:05,281
bright side.
Yeah,

471
00:20:05,281 --> 00:20:05,281
but you were looking at the end of 
civilization.

472
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:10,420
Just looking at the moment.
I was looking at your dues statue and 

473
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:10,420
your Voodoo doll and you're kind of 
getting your,

474
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,470
your,
your sort of demon that represented

475
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:14,070
this.
Well,

476
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:14,700
no,
I'm actually,

477
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,720
the Balinese stuff has just.
I've always been fascinated by eastern 

478
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:19,720
art.
I think it's beautiful and I,

479
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,690
I think it's amazing how cheap it is.
You could get this amazing.

480
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,140
Thank you.
Because that's a haunted.

481
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,350
That's why.
Because there's little kids that made it

482
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,880
as a four year old kids.
Made it a little ginger kid

483
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:29,880
artwork.
Man.

484
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,000
I love this one of those things.
I'm not really into like,

485
00:20:33,001 --> 00:20:33,510
you know,
I've,

486
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,080
I've bought paintings before and I don't
kind of get a lot of what people are 

487
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,560
really into.
So there's some.

488
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,680
I was at a,
um,

489
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:45,720
a guy's house once and uh,
he had a picture on the wall and I go,

490
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,740
oh,
did you couldn't make that.

491
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,130
And this guy goes,
oh no,

492
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:50,030
that's a little bit,
but uh,

493
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,120
that's like $30,000
and I went,

494
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:56,400
what the fuck are you talking about?
It looked like some painting on some are

495
00:20:56,401 --> 00:21:01,401
ripped pieces of cardboard that were 
randomly stuck in a beautiful frame and 

496
00:21:01,401 --> 00:21:04,150
I really thought that it was something 
that a kid did.

497
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:05,740
So I don't get that

498
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,620
there needs to be done one that's just 
that kind of shit like Gold Buddhists,

499
00:21:09,621 --> 00:21:11,840
but more of a corporate place that's 
just super cheap.

500
00:21:11,841 --> 00:21:15,070
Like that could be like $10.
I want to buy a dragon mass,

501
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:16,640
but I went feathers.
I want to be cheap,

502
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:21,910
you know,
because like that kind of Shit's 

503
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:21,910
popular.
Everyone likes that kind of shit.

504
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:22,270
Why don't they make it like a walmart of
that shit,

505
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,380
Brian?
I think you're missing.

506
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:26,810
I also think that they should make cat 
food and dog food into one food.

507
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,170
They could probably easily do that.
I don't think they can.

508
00:21:30,171 --> 00:21:31,580
I think they have different dietary 
needs.

509
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,290
They can all eat chicken.
Right.

510
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,520
Okay.
So put that on the list.

511
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,760
If you want to go check it all.
Even bazell put chicken base.

512
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:42,470
This guy is brutal to work with.
I'm sorry bro.

513
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,810
I brought a serious man in here.
It's fucking New York Times crazy.

514
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,800
You're talking nonsense about cat and 
dog food.

515
00:21:48,801 --> 00:21:50,870
You Lazy contract and go out and buy the
cat food,

516
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,260
the dog food and stop fucking up the 
shots.

517
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,130
Eating dog food and my dogs eating the 
cat food.

518
00:21:55,131 --> 00:21:57,350
Wanting to just make you got a problem 
that you've got to pat

519
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,960
girlfriends.
You fuck this guy.

520
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:04,970
He's.
He gets a new relationship and it's 

521
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:04,970
like,
oh my God,

522
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,571
we should get a kid and they go out and 
they get a fucking dog and then the 

523
00:22:07,571 --> 00:22:07,890
girls dump them and he's got a God damn.

524
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,400
It's like watching lower for nanny.
I'm like,

525
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,120
daddy warbucks

526
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,110
brock.
Sorry man,

527
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,710
this.
This is a serious podcast,

528
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,730
but it's also.
It's also a comedy podcast.

529
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,990
The good news is we've had an excellent 
conversation.

530
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,710
I guarantee you a lot of people will buy
your shit.

531
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,060
So.
Hey Joe.

532
00:22:24,061 --> 00:22:27,330
I was at the comedy store and there's.
There's that whole coast that goes thing

533
00:22:27,331 --> 00:22:29,210
that happened at the fucking ghosts 
anywhere.

534
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,930
I know,
but I'm so tired of,

535
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,550
do you believe in ghosts?
Of course.

536
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,380
Oh my God.
Jo.

537
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:39,670
I was,
I was sitting in the green room behind 

538
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:39,670
the main room.
We were all smoking hot.

539
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:44,430
Doesn't know that ghosts are real.
I've collected so many incredible 

540
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:44,430
stories about ghosts.
Really.

541
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:44,850
What do they do?

542
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:45,700
Uh,
I mean,

543
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,430
a friend of mine,
her,

544
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,250
her,
uh,

545
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:54,290
friend's brother had had committed 
suicide and she was sleeping in the 

546
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:58,101
house where he had died and she had a 
dream that they were having sex and she 

547
00:22:59,761 --> 00:23:02,070
woke up from the dream and um,
her,

548
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,430
her covers were up and there was this 
kind of like spirit figure over her.

549
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,440
And as soon as she began to open her 
eyes,

550
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:12,530
it dissipated.
There's no way that could have been a 

551
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:12,530
dream inside of dream.
Of course,

552
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:12,530
it could have been anything.
Of course it could be,

553
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,040
but I'm gonna have,
you know,

554
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:13,910
I mean,
we,

555
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,330
you know,
because there's no,

556
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,640
you know,
how are you going to verify this type of

557
00:23:17,641 --> 00:23:22,641
thing?
What I've collected a whole number of 

558
00:23:22,641 --> 00:23:23,270
anecdotes told to me by people and 
observing their,

559
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,030
you know,
their,

560
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,110
their state,
their,

561
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,600
their,
their,

562
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:26,220
their,
their,

563
00:23:26,221 --> 00:23:29,910
their efforts to kind of understand it,
to fathom at my own experiences.

564
00:23:29,911 --> 00:23:31,120
Also I've had similar,
you know,

565
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:31,700
it's,
I,

566
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,500
I think that there's no doubt that,
you know,

567
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,340
probably,
you know,

568
00:23:35,341 --> 00:23:40,341
psychic energy collects in physical 
environments and when people are no 

569
00:23:40,341 --> 00:23:42,390
longer there,
if they have a stake in that environment

570
00:23:42,391 --> 00:23:45,440
and they are not finished with their 
business in the world that they out,

571
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,210
you know,
or some pieces of the energy of it

572
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:52,500
and resentment or something,
some sort of a bad energy is enough to 

573
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:52,950
keep a resident

574
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,160
do.
When my father died,

575
00:23:55,161 --> 00:24:00,161
I mean he had a loft,
was full of his paintings and 

576
00:24:00,161 --> 00:24:00,161
sculptures,
you know,

577
00:24:00,161 --> 00:24:00,410
the last.
And he had a big freight elevator.

578
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:02,930
Like I was working with two guys 
bringing his stuff out.

579
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,280
As we're bringing out the last shipment 
of,

580
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:10,290
of,
of his sculptures down in the freight 

581
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,071
elevator.
Suddenly the light bulb and it just 

582
00:24:12,071 --> 00:24:12,440
totally popped and we were in darkness 
and you know,

583
00:24:12,441 --> 00:24:13,330
we were all looking at it.
We,

584
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,010
nobody had touched it,
you know,

585
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,080
somehow that psychic energy that was,
that was constellated between us and 

586
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,370
him,
you know,

587
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,630
caused this thing to happen,
or the light bulb I was Joe,

588
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:28,380
I was in the phone call that you going 
to have to make today.

589
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,500
To me,
there are certain things when you feel 

590
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:33,500
the synchronicity,
it's like,

591
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:33,500
it's like a click,
you know,

592
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,380
and it's like you have an intuitive,
you know,

593
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,540
acceptance that uh,
you're,

594
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:42,800
you're being shown a little bit of like 
the fabric of space time making a little

595
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:45,710
bit of a ripple or something.
I was in the green room

596
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:50,790
seriously with like eight people in the 
comedy store to started the company 

597
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:54,440
store,
if you didn't know for just Fyi was 

598
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,911
Ciro's nightclub and it was a bugsy 
Siegel's hanging out in Hollywood and a 

599
00:24:56,911 --> 00:24:58,960
lot of people allegedly were murdered 
there.

600
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:04,320
And every single person who has been 
there for more than x amount of years 

601
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,320
has some sort of a ghost story.
Every one of the waitresses has 

602
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:10,720
something managers have something,
you know,

603
00:25:10,721 --> 00:25:13,210
how much of it is psychosomatic,
how much of his suggestion,

604
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,280
how much does the other comics,
and I was sitting there with like eight 

605
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,400
other people were just smoking weed,
hanging out,

606
00:25:19,401 --> 00:25:24,401
talking,
and suddenly the door sounded like 

607
00:25:24,401 --> 00:25:24,710
somebody shot a gun through like,
it didn't feel like sound,

608
00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:26,660
like somebody just shook it or kicked 
it.

609
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:31,870
It seemed way more powerful than that to
the fact that I think everybody in the 

610
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:32,870
room kinda got down was like,
what the fuck was that?

611
00:25:32,871 --> 00:25:37,871
And we all Kinda got down like on the 
couches and on the ground as if we all 

612
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:38,450
thought for sure that was a gunshot,
right?

613
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,960
We'll lose.
Let me stop right there.

614
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,090
And then of course,
old ass building.

615
00:25:42,091 --> 00:25:44,490
Here's what's important.
This is a building for the 19 twenties.

616
00:25:44,491 --> 00:25:46,320
That's fucking fault line,
right?

617
00:25:46,321 --> 00:25:49,580
Those buildings shift and every now and 
then they shift and they literally,

618
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,690
and it'll,
it'll make a noise.

619
00:25:51,691 --> 00:25:53,340
I've been in the car when it makes 
noise.

620
00:25:53,341 --> 00:25:55,100
Okay.
It's old married.

621
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,030
Fuck.
I'm not saying that it wasn't a ghost.

622
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,820
Now the most likely explanation is that 
right?

623
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:02,240
I thought it was another comic and he's 
just like the secret,

624
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:02,750
like,
Oh yeah,

625
00:26:02,751 --> 00:26:05,510
we take this plunger and then we just 
hit it as hard as we can

626
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,050
let comedy secret.
I'm sorry,

627
00:26:08,051 --> 00:26:13,051
my grandparents lived in a uh,
supposedly haunted house and I stayed 

628
00:26:13,051 --> 00:26:13,051
there with them in,
uh,

629
00:26:13,051 --> 00:26:17,830
in Newark,
New Jersey and it was on north ninth 

630
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,251
street and there was a guy who actually 
died in the house and he was a guy who 

631
00:26:20,251 --> 00:26:21,560
was renting a room there and he died and
they,

632
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:26,580
they always thought that this house was 
haunted though because the house was 

633
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,480
always making noises,
but it's a fucking house that was built 

634
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:30,480
in like 19.
Oh nine,

635
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,890
you know,
it's an old fucking house and when 

636
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:38,250
you're dealing in a place like New 
Jersey that's moist all the time and it 

637
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,940
rains all the time and then it gets hot 
in the summer and cold in the winter she

638
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,790
would is like,
you know,

639
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:45,480
it's an piece of,
you know,

640
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,750
construction.
It couldn't,

641
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,840
it constricts,
it expands depending on the moisture in 

642
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,041
the air,
depending on it being cold or hot and 

643
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:55,041
the car,
the old houses like that.

644
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:56,370
They make a lot of fucking noise in the 
creek.

645
00:26:56,670 --> 00:27:01,670
There always were clock and people are 
just fucking places or it's an old house

646
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:08,031
man,
but I'm not completely averse to the 

647
00:27:08,031 --> 00:27:11,331
idea of ghosts,
but a lot of people that talk about 

648
00:27:11,331 --> 00:27:11,331
ghosts are full of shit.

649
00:27:11,331 --> 00:27:14,870
Well I just think if there is goes,
there would be an easy way to prove it 

650
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:17,991
and we've talked about it before.
You just go to somebody that's like 

651
00:27:17,991 --> 00:27:19,680
wifes got died in a rape and you go to 
his grave and just or her grave and just

652
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:22,280
start humping her grave or something.
You know,

653
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,570
if there was such thing as that goes,
goes would come out and be like,

654
00:27:24,571 --> 00:27:25,250
dude,
what the fuck?

655
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,580
They wouldn't want to indulge you and 
your nonsense.

656
00:27:27,581 --> 00:27:31,510
Maybe you would hit the wrong if maybe 
maybe it's not something that can easily

657
00:27:31,511 --> 00:27:34,030
be tuned in.
Maybe it's like the northern lights,

658
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,440
like the idea of,
you know,

659
00:27:35,441 --> 00:27:40,441
you can't capture the northern lights 
and put it in the fucking beam and 

660
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:40,870
blasted on Manhattan.
The northern lights are,

661
00:27:40,871 --> 00:27:45,871
you know,
it's a theory that some sort of a thing 

662
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:46,090
that moves and pulsates in the sky,
you know,

663
00:27:46,091 --> 00:27:48,940
maybe that's what like a ghost is like a
very minor version of that.

664
00:27:48,941 --> 00:27:53,170
Like it doesn't have a rhyme or reason 
for when it exists or doesn't exist,

665
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:58,171
but it doesn't have a rhyme and reason.
It's just we don't understand those laws

666
00:27:58,391 --> 00:28:02,280
yet.
You say that violates nature.

667
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,470
Just that our understanding of natural 
law is limited by our,

668
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:10,890
by our mental conception,
by the type of science that we've 

669
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:10,890
constructed and so on.
Are you convinced,

670
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:15,571
I mean what like when you look at the 
evidence of ghosts and not go shows,

671
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:17,710
if you looked at.

672
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:18,700
Wait,
wait,

673
00:28:18,701 --> 00:28:23,701
what evidence are you talking about?
Do we have any solid evidence ever that 

674
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:23,701
there was a ghost or just speculation?

675
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:26,480
Almost entirely speculation.
There's no scientific evidence.

676
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,340
Well,
it doesn't mean that they're not real.

677
00:28:28,341 --> 00:28:29,900
Because if you think about what a ghost 
is,

678
00:28:29,901 --> 00:28:34,901
if it goes to something that's not in 
this dimension and sort of flits in and 

679
00:28:34,901 --> 00:28:35,270
out of it,
and how do you measure that?

680
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,180
I mean sciences,
you know,

681
00:28:38,181 --> 00:28:38,870
everybody says,
well,

682
00:28:38,871 --> 00:28:42,170
science says there are no ghosts or 
there's no scientific evidence that goes

683
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:45,920
will science was not really designed to 
measure shit like ghosts.

684
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,520
Science is designed to measure like how 
much does lead way.

685
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,840
You know what happens when a star goes 
supernova observable things.

686
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,080
When you get something like a ghost.
If a ghost was real and it seems 

687
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,500
incredibly rare phenomenon that depended
on some really exotic conditions,

688
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:04,280
how the fuck you.

689
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:07,430
I can imagine that I'm giving the offer.
If there's any ghosts listening,

690
00:29:07,431 --> 00:29:12,020
they can fucking raped me tonight and 
they could just rate my ass all day long

691
00:29:12,021 --> 00:29:14,810
with sticks.
And if it happens,

692
00:29:14,811 --> 00:29:16,130
I'll let you know.
I've got news for you.

693
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,830
If they're going to come here from 
another guy can do better than me.

694
00:29:18,831 --> 00:29:20,370
I mean for instance,
there is like um,

695
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,520
decent and interesting evidence around a
reincarnation really.

696
00:29:23,521 --> 00:29:25,800
There was a book,
a person's name in Stevens,

697
00:29:25,801 --> 00:29:28,290
was a professor at University of 
Virginia to like 2,500

698
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:32,610
page book called neurobiology and 
reincarnation intersect and he found all

699
00:29:32,611 --> 00:29:37,611
around the world there were children who
had spontaneous recall of past lives and

700
00:29:38,851 --> 00:29:41,070
often very specific like an India.
They'd be like,

701
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:41,790
you know,
I was,

702
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,000
I

703
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,300
lived in this town.
I'm,

704
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,610
my wife had this name.
I had two kids.

705
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:50,940
So in a number of cases he found these 
kids and he went back to the towns and 

706
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,260
they talked about and,
and they found this family and establish

707
00:29:54,261 --> 00:29:56,540
that there had been this,
this connection and,

708
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:59,050
and um,
the sense of familiarity.

709
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,860
No,
no genetic,

710
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,480
no genetic line,
no genetic link.

711
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:05,340
And sometimes the kids would even have 
like a pronounced birthmark,

712
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,120
like a birthmark on the neck or 
something.

713
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,360
And it turned out that the previous 
incarnation perhaps had died of a wound 

714
00:30:12,881 --> 00:30:14,500
to the neck and a fight or something 
like that.

715
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,330
Is it possible that the connection is an
abstract one that you know,

716
00:30:18,331 --> 00:30:18,810
that they,
they,

717
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,630
they haven't met it yet,
but that yet there's not a,

718
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:26,660
a balanced value to learn to experiences
that are transferred through genetics,

719
00:30:27,001 --> 00:30:32,001
like instincts and that perhaps some 
instincts that we have a really like 

720
00:30:32,001 --> 00:30:33,020
things go wrong.
You learn from them.

721
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,130
That's why you're afraid of cats.
Mean kids are afraid of them.

722
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,390
Seven year old kid and suddenly out of 
nowhere saying,

723
00:30:38,391 --> 00:30:40,220
you know,
I have a wife and Agora,

724
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,420
I have two kids

725
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,340
to see them.
Yeah,

726
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,660
this is.
But this is my point isn't impossible.

727
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:49,780
I mean,
isn't it possible that somehow or 

728
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,000
another that there is a,
a memory that through whatever,

729
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:55,001
a mutation or whatever extreme condition
or weird circumstance as far as like 

730
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:59,771
physical biology becomes a more potent 
one and that this as it is transferred 

731
00:30:59,931 --> 00:31:04,370
through through generations awakens this
memory awakens this,

732
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:09,520
this,
this experience that someone who shared 

733
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,431
these genetics,
oh so many generations ago actually did 

734
00:31:12,431 --> 00:31:12,431
have.
Then all of a sudden,

735
00:31:12,431 --> 00:31:12,580
for whatever strange,

736
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,140
if there's any,
um,

737
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,150
idea that,
you know,

738
00:31:16,151 --> 00:31:17,060
genetic material,
it could have,

739
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,220
could have hold memory like that.

740
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,320
Well,
what about memes?

741
00:31:19,321 --> 00:31:21,390
What are the,
what about the idea that even racism can

742
00:31:21,391 --> 00:31:22,710
be transferred genetically?
I mean,

743
00:31:22,711 --> 00:31:25,530
that's a really kind of a,
a widely considered idea.

744
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:28,470
Almost unprovable,
but I considered by mainstream science.

745
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,060
Yes.
I think a lot of those,

746
00:31:30,061 --> 00:31:31,630
those,
those ideas about all these things being

747
00:31:31,631 --> 00:31:36,631
inherited by the genetics being this 
kind of master molecule are actually 

748
00:31:36,631 --> 00:31:38,690
being kind of challenged right now by 
the emerging biology of epigenetics,

749
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,540
which is recognizing that,
you know,

750
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:46,541
awareness actually begins at the 
boundary of the cell where chemical 

751
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:48,230
signals are exchanged.
There's a kind of cognitive process that

752
00:31:48,231 --> 00:31:53,231
happens even at the permeable boundary 
of the cell as some signals are allowed 

753
00:31:53,231 --> 00:31:57,161
in and some are ignored or rejected and 
that's what's allowed in actually then 

754
00:31:57,161 --> 00:32:01,991
influences how the genetic material 
expresses itself and reproduces itself.

755
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,620
That actually it's not so much the 
genetic material is the master molecule.

756
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,130
It's more as if the whole cell is a unit
of cognition or awareness.

757
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,710
This is very much thinking of people 
like a Varella,

758
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,130
but is this a theory or they have done.
Okay,

759
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:16,980
well,
they haven't done it,

760
00:32:16,981 --> 00:32:18,090
but everything was counting.

761
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:18,930
Yeah.
I mean,

762
00:32:18,931 --> 00:32:21,700
this is a look at the biologist Bruce 
Lipton.

763
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:23,910
He has a book called a biology beyond 
belief.

764
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,470
Really looking at how,
um,

765
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,800
you know,
consciousness and awareness began even 

766
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,591
at a cellular level and how that in 
itself influences and inflects how the 

767
00:32:33,591 --> 00:32:36,720
genetic material expresses itself.
That the genes are not master molecules.

768
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,220
The whole idea it,
it's so fascinating.

769
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,450
The idea of,
you know,

770
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,880
I mean w w what,
what instincts when we're,

771
00:32:44,881 --> 00:32:46,220
we're,
do we instincts come from.

772
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:48,320
I mean,
is it all from one initial source,

773
00:32:48,321 --> 00:32:49,970
you know,
stay away from fire.

774
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:51,650
You get scared when you see snakes.
I mean,

775
00:32:51,651 --> 00:32:55,070
these are all learned impressions and in
our,

776
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,410
our material,
the material that makes human beings are

777
00:32:57,411 --> 00:33:00,920
certain things that you show people and 
children when they're really young,

778
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:04,440
have certain fears and notions of the 
bogeyman and the,

779
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:04,920
you know,
the,

780
00:33:04,921 --> 00:33:07,520
the monster that lives in the woods and 
the things in the dark and,

781
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:12,790
and a lot of these are imprinted from 
being killed by Jaguars from some 

782
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:17,280
protocol hominid that lived 5,000
or 5 million years ago there got killed 

783
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:17,780
by Jaguars.
And those,

784
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:22,250
those instincts are still tingling in 
the background noise of our mind.

785
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,370
That's possible.
And that could also be explained.

786
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,590
You ever get into like rupert sheldrake 
his ideas around the morphogenic field,

787
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:31,190
but knowing when their parents coming 
home,

788
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:36,220
so maybe there was this species 
encounter that was like a near death 

789
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,810
encounter for humanity and it left this 
morphogenic field of,

790
00:33:37,811 --> 00:33:40,610
of,
of fear and terror around the snake,

791
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,050
around the Jaguar or something like 
that.

792
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,000
Yeah.
Well we are certainly moving.

793
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:49,090
I mean if I had to guess into some sort 
of a state where that becomes more and 

794
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,870
more aware now,
wouldn't you agree?

795
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:55,900
What becomes more and more aware that 
the state that have this 

796
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,120
interconnectedness,
this morphogenetic field,

797
00:33:56,121 --> 00:34:01,121
this idea that you know,
that we are living in social or a 

798
00:34:01,121 --> 00:34:05,681
complex meshwork of biological life and 
natural natural laws and physics and 

799
00:34:07,431 --> 00:34:12,431
space and radiation and all of it 
together combined by and it sort of 

800
00:34:12,431 --> 00:34:15,260
people are realizing it now like way 
more than ever before.

801
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:16,580
I mean,
when I was a kid,

802
00:34:16,581 --> 00:34:19,550
there was no talk.
There was nothing along these lines.

803
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,640
Yeah,
it's extraordinary.

804
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:25,641
And,
and maybe that is pointing towards the 

805
00:34:25,641 --> 00:34:27,030
kind of next phase of evolution as a 
species.

806
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:32,031
I mean,
do you think it's technology and it's 

807
00:34:32,031 --> 00:34:32,031
going to do that?
Well,

808
00:34:32,031 --> 00:34:35,001
I think we have to look at technology 
itself as an aspect of the evolution of 

809
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:35,001
consciousness.
You know,

810
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:40,010
that actually like we're,
we're a tool using and toolmaking 

811
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,680
species.
We make a new tool and then we look at 

812
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,591
the tool with the instrument we've made.
It reflects us back at ourself and then 

813
00:34:45,591 --> 00:34:46,620
it gives us new metaphors for 
understanding ourselves.

814
00:34:46,621 --> 00:34:51,621
Then it allows us to make another more 
advanced tool and that creates a whole 

815
00:34:51,621 --> 00:34:55,821
new set of metaphor.
So now we've gotten to the point in our 

816
00:34:55,821 --> 00:34:58,820
tool creation and tool using or this 
feedback loop is happening faster and 

817
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:58,890
faster,
so we're having,

818
00:34:58,891 --> 00:34:59,520
we're,
we're better,

819
00:34:59,521 --> 00:35:03,570
but it's still a tool as a projection of
our consciousness,

820
00:35:03,571 --> 00:35:08,571
of our thought into the material realm,
which then gives us information about 

821
00:35:08,571 --> 00:35:12,411
ourselves,
which then leads us to create another 

822
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:12,450
tool which also advances and evolves our
consciousness.

823
00:35:12,451 --> 00:35:12,600
In that

824
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,180
process,
do you ever get to the point where you,

825
00:35:15,181 --> 00:35:15,800
uh,
you,

826
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:18,480
you get upset that you have a connection
with these,

827
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,910
these items,
these technological items like phones or

828
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:23,880
do do not regret it ever?
Or do you just accept it,

829
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:29,110
enjoy it?
Like I think it's very fascinating and 

830
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:29,110
it's also as we've been,
part of what we'll be doing with reality

831
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:32,330
sandwich is bringing people down to work
with indigenous Shamans and elders.

832
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:36,170
So recently we went down to the Columbia
and worked with these Kogi guys from the

833
00:35:36,171 --> 00:35:38,670
mountains in Columbia.
And when we hung out with them,

834
00:35:38,671 --> 00:35:42,060
we were in a place without any 
electricity for eight days.

835
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,320
So no phone,
no computer after like a day and a half.

836
00:35:46,321 --> 00:35:51,321
I was like,
what did I want all that stuff for 

837
00:35:51,321 --> 00:35:51,321
again,
like,

838
00:35:51,321 --> 00:35:53,150
this is so much nicer now.
Suddenly you can see the stars at night.

839
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,160
You're like light a fire and the fire 
goes out and you go to sleep.

840
00:35:56,161 --> 00:35:57,320
You wake up at dawn.
I mean,

841
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:58,970
you know,
I think that actually we,

842
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:03,990
we may find that we've gone way too far 
on this technological path that we 

843
00:36:04,501 --> 00:36:06,660
thought that we've had a kind of,
um,

844
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,900
in a sense the religious belief of 
modern society is linear technological 

845
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,371
progress leading to some kind of 
singularity or transformation that we 

846
00:36:16,371 --> 00:36:17,610
may actually back up from that and be 
like,

847
00:36:17,611 --> 00:36:18,390
well,
wait a second.

848
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,490
Where is this stuff leading to?
I mean,

849
00:36:20,491 --> 00:36:23,310
actually I have more plastics in my 
tissues.

850
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:28,510
You know,
my eyes are going bad from looking at 

851
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:28,510
these tiny screens.
You know,

852
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,300
why is life constantly mediated by 
glowing rectangular screens anyway?

853
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:35,570
That actually we might want to retract 
from this technological path and develop

854
00:36:36,391 --> 00:36:39,300
in a different direction,
which doesn't mean rejecting technology.

855
00:36:39,301 --> 00:36:42,120
It's more about mastering our 
projections rather than,

856
00:36:42,121 --> 00:36:44,580
rather than feeling that we always have 
to get a meshed in them.

857
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:49,830
And then move in that direction,
is it sort of like riding a bike too 

858
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:50,160
fast and you're going downhill and you 
go,

859
00:36:50,161 --> 00:36:52,530
oh fuck,
like it's good to ride this bike.

860
00:36:52,531 --> 00:36:57,531
But I've gotten kind of away from my own
biological control of this situation.

861
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,720
Well,
that's certainly what's happened to us 

862
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:02,720
as a species.
I mean,

863
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:02,720
um,
you know,

864
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,140
in every level we've been seduced by our
technological production projections in 

865
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,260
a sense.
We've lost our grounding on the planet.

866
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:12,970
What do you ever consider the idea that 
when some sort of a weird symbiotic 

867
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:16,271
relationship where it's our job as the 
host to create this environment?

868
00:37:17,091 --> 00:37:19,490
Where are the parasite,
which is technology?

869
00:37:19,491 --> 00:37:24,491
There's new life form that we've created
to exist in that ultimately discard us 

870
00:37:24,491 --> 00:37:27,110
because it is the next stage of not 
organic life,

871
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:29,150
but of consciousness and that 
consciousness.

872
00:37:29,151 --> 00:37:34,151
The next stage of consciousness will be 
artificial consciousness created by 

873
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:37,241
this,
this consciousness that was created by 

874
00:37:37,241 --> 00:37:38,030
biological life and that we are only 
here to usher in the next stage.

875
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:43,070
That next stage is in electronic form.
A stage that doesn't have emotions or 

876
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,060
nonsense or

877
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,570
any of this shit that is not the way I 
look at it.

878
00:37:46,571 --> 00:37:47,620
And we don't,
we don't.

879
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,190
Well,
we don't,

880
00:37:48,191 --> 00:37:49,540
we don't know.
We have no,

881
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:53,530
we have no reason at this point to 
really believe that,

882
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:58,580
you know,
an artificial intelligence can become 

883
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:58,580
conscious in the way we are.
I mean,

884
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,230
machines may have,
you know,

885
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,310
a form,
I mean everything.

886
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,370
We have a form of sentience but,
but,

887
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:03,040
but,
uh,

888
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:08,041
you know,
we may still have a very important role 

889
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:09,610
if we're,
if we're in our proper state,

890
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,140
you know,
in,

891
00:38:10,141 --> 00:38:11,650
in,
in the cosmic unfolding.

892
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,750
But should we,
I mean if,

893
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:15,530
or a,
a step along the way,

894
00:38:15,531 --> 00:38:18,050
what,
who's to say that that step eventually a

895
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:23,860
continues along a biological train.
Maybe it really is truly our destiny to 

896
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,290
create some sort of an artificial life 
that's not burdened down by our,

897
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:31,310
our,
our monkey DNA and all the instincts 

898
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,941
that we needed to evolve to this point 
with the curiosity that would allow us 

899
00:38:33,941 --> 00:38:34,940
to make something as crazy as artificial
intelligence.

900
00:38:34,941 --> 00:38:39,941
And maybe we're just the carriers maybe 
where the carriers of the disease that 

901
00:38:39,941 --> 00:38:40,680
eventually takes off and,
and.

902
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:45,770
Well,
I guess part of what I would suggest to 

903
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:45,770
you is that,
you know,

904
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:49,211
part of our opportunity right now is to 
become cocreative with the evolutionary 

905
00:38:49,211 --> 00:38:53,591
process.
And that in a way means that we have to 

906
00:38:53,591 --> 00:38:55,991
step into a much more responsible and 
mature role where we actually become 

907
00:38:55,991 --> 00:39:00,551
participants and,
and in a way we still kind of enjoy the 

908
00:39:00,551 --> 00:39:03,860
spectacle of our own alienation and our 
own potential destruction.

909
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:07,350
So we kind of enjoy kind of like 
elaborating the,

910
00:39:07,351 --> 00:39:12,351
the,
the sort of futuristic mythologies of 

911
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:13,250
how our technology is going to overwhelm
us or devour us.

912
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:18,251
I mean that might be the case,
but all we really know at this point is 

913
00:39:18,251 --> 00:39:18,740
that we have,
will,

914
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:23,860
we have intelligence,
we have consciousness and we're not 

915
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:23,990
using it very well.
So the first thing I would think that we

916
00:39:23,991 --> 00:39:28,991
would want to try to do is use it very,
very effectively to see what type of 

917
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:32,140
better situation we can rapidly create.
You know,

918
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:35,870
rather than fobbing off our 
responsibility onto,

919
00:39:35,871 --> 00:39:40,871
oh,
there's going to be this technological 

920
00:39:40,871 --> 00:39:40,871
thing or it's too late,
we fucked the planet,

921
00:39:40,871 --> 00:39:43,550
or there's some new age psychic children
coming along.

922
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,120
All that stuff to me is just bullshit 
ass dodges.

923
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:51,280
That basically is other ways that we're 
avoiding taking full responsibility for 

924
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,930
the planetary situation that we as a 
species have created,

925
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:59,170
which is for me is really the only way 
we're going to possibly create a better 

926
00:39:59,170 --> 00:39:59,660
world in the time that we have before 
things go to hell.

927
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:04,830
Well,
I do agree that as a person who's a big 

928
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:04,830
proponent of team people,
you know,

929
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:08,970
I definitely advocate the idea of us 
figuring out what the fuck we are doing 

930
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:11,350
and making it better for all of us and 
our relationship with the planet.

931
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,290
But to me that doesn't seem like you're 
fobbing that off.

932
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:19,291
But the,
considering the possibility that we are 

933
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,950
merely here as many other parasites and 
hosts are in this world.

934
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:26,100
And you look at like grasshoppers where 
there's they're infected by aquatic 

935
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:30,841
worms and aquatic worms trick the 
grasshopper into jumping into water and 

936
00:40:30,841 --> 00:40:31,460
the grasshopper drowns.

937
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,270
Well,
so the world can be born out of it.

938
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:38,160
I personally think that we actually are 
infected but by a parasitical agency.

939
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:42,690
And I would say that agency is something
like the dominator empire complex,

940
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,960
the,
the sense that we have of separation 

941
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:47,960
from nature,
the sense that we have the right to,

942
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,940
you know,
annihilate ecosystems,

943
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,830
dominate ecosystems,
control other people.

944
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,930
The whole,
the whole trip of empire,

945
00:40:54,931 --> 00:40:59,931
the slavery.
I mean there's still tons of slavery 

946
00:40:59,931 --> 00:40:59,931
around the world domination of women 
that,

947
00:40:59,931 --> 00:41:04,131
that's,
that's the parasite that's eating us 

948
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:04,131
alive right now.
And that's where,

949
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:08,061
you know,
if we can go through our entire 

950
00:41:08,061 --> 00:41:08,061
initiatory process,
we,

951
00:41:08,061 --> 00:41:08,061
we,
we can,

952
00:41:08,061 --> 00:41:09,090
we can begin to,
you know,

953
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,120
find the antidote or the cure to that.
But it's not about,

954
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,070
you know,
from my perspective,

955
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,920
like giving it up to technology,
you know,

956
00:41:16,921 --> 00:41:20,080
as an amazing thing.
It's more like reclaiming our,

957
00:41:20,081 --> 00:41:21,270
our human capacity.

958
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:22,130
And for me,
that,

959
00:41:22,131 --> 00:41:27,131
that's really where the,
the knowledge of the indigenous people 

960
00:41:27,131 --> 00:41:27,131
is not,
you know,

961
00:41:27,131 --> 00:41:28,290
folk tale.
It's not silly,

962
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:30,510
it's not worthless.
It's actually something that,

963
00:41:30,511 --> 00:41:31,080
that,
you know,

964
00:41:31,081 --> 00:41:34,130
those of us who care about you seeking 
to,

965
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:37,790
you know,
move into an evolutionary framework.

966
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:38,690
Uh,
you know,

967
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,330
it's,
they,

968
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,450
they have,
they have tools and gifts for us.

969
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,350
And that's why part of what I've been 
trying to do over the last couple,

970
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:49,370
well a lot of my work but,
but now in a different way is build 

971
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:52,661
bridges to,
to the indigenous people and their 

972
00:41:52,661 --> 00:41:52,661
knowledge systems,
you know.

973
00:41:52,661 --> 00:41:54,110
So I'm working now with the Kogi in 
Columbia and also

974
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:57,070
the sequoia from Ecuador.
Uh,

975
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:57,700
wha.
What,

976
00:41:57,701 --> 00:42:00,620
what I meant by that was not that it has
to be,

977
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:03,590
it almost like when I,
when I,

978
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,350
when I look at the relationship that we 
have with,

979
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:11,560
with technology and I look at the 
relationship that different parents 

980
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,420
sites and different hosts have it just 
as a consideration.

981
00:42:14,421 --> 00:42:19,421
You have to think about the fact that 
our society is completely obsessed with 

982
00:42:19,421 --> 00:42:23,411
pushing innovation.
We're completely obsessed and I often 

983
00:42:23,411 --> 00:42:24,530
look at the dominator culture,
what you describe,

984
00:42:24,531 --> 00:42:24,980
and I say,
well,

985
00:42:24,981 --> 00:42:25,720
you know,
you're right.

986
00:42:25,721 --> 00:42:30,721
I mean that is a huge fucking problem.
War and the domination of other 

987
00:42:30,721 --> 00:42:34,061
countries and battling for resources,
but what do you say to people that say 

988
00:42:34,061 --> 00:42:36,770
that there's no way you can have a 
society that,

989
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:41,890
that reaches this particular height this
fast without that as a byproduct and 

990
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:48,311
that in fact the reason why people push 
so hard to innovate and to create new 

991
00:42:48,311 --> 00:42:49,690
things and conquer new,
new,

992
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:52,430
new new boundaries both scientifically 
and socially,

993
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:57,700
is that it's all almost a byproduct of 
this desire to innovate and create and 

994
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:03,400
produce this next thing and that this is
all a part of us creating some 

995
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,750
artificial thing.

996
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:05,600
Some intelligence.

997
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,110
I,
I think we have to.

998
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:12,140
We have to,
we have to break the trance of 

999
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:14,601
technology,
which is not to say that we reject 

1000
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:17,031
technology,
but we have to break that trance that 

1001
00:43:17,031 --> 00:43:17,031
somehow,
you know,

1002
00:43:17,031 --> 00:43:19,770
there's this linear technological 
progress is necessarily,

1003
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,920
you know,
bringing us to something super amazing.

1004
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:28,160
And for me,
the shift in the future is more to a 

1005
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,910
kind of psycho technical phase of 
development.

1006
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:31,750
By that I mean that,
you know,

1007
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:32,970
if you do,
you know,

1008
00:43:32,971 --> 00:43:35,850
if you've had the DMT and the Ayahuasca 
experiences,

1009
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,680
the yoga experiences and so on,
you,

1010
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:40,590
you recognize there are these vast 
dimensions,

1011
00:43:40,591 --> 00:43:45,591
you know,
within the psyche that are basically 

1012
00:43:45,591 --> 00:43:48,051
unknown incontinence and,
and in a sense that for me is where the 

1013
00:43:48,331 --> 00:43:51,090
action is going to lie for us in the 
future,

1014
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:56,390
you know,
as well as potentially exploring other 

1015
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:56,670
planets,
other solar systems and all this stuff.

1016
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:59,550
But,
but at the moment we really more need to

1017
00:43:59,551 --> 00:44:04,551
get control of our thought projections.
And the only way to do that is to 

1018
00:44:04,551 --> 00:44:07,260
undergo an initiatory process that 
involves,

1019
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:12,350
you know,
kind of getting into our unconscious 

1020
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:13,070
patterns.
Initiatory process.

1021
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,330
What do you mean?
Yeah.

1022
00:44:15,331 --> 00:44:16,230
Well,
I mean like,

1023
00:44:16,231 --> 00:44:17,520
you know,
hanging,

1024
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:20,010
you know,
fasting or hanging by your packs for six

1025
00:44:20,011 --> 00:44:23,100
days or taking Iowasca,
you know,

1026
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:25,240
for a couple of weeks until you know 
you're,

1027
00:44:25,241 --> 00:44:26,250
you're,
you're so nauseous.

1028
00:44:26,251 --> 00:44:28,390
Did you can't believe it,
but still vision.

1029
00:44:28,391 --> 00:44:30,930
The insights keep coming up and they 
begin to heal.

1030
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:33,180
Have your,
um,

1031
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:33,810
you know,

1032
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:38,930
pathetic humanness,
you save the setting humanness,

1033
00:44:38,931 --> 00:44:43,931
but then why are you,
you completely averse to the idea that 

1034
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:44,090
we are just here to develop something 
else,

1035
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:49,330
which I mean,
we obviously are just a step along the 

1036
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:49,330
way and will be unrecognizable few 
million years.

1037
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:49,340
Think that what we're here to do

1038
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:50,760
develop is,
uh,

1039
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,960
you know,
integrity,

1040
00:44:51,961 --> 00:44:54,630
consciousness and willpower.
And once we've developed that,

1041
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:57,960
then we can think about what else we may
develop at the moment.

1042
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:59,460
We don't have that.
We just think we do.

1043
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:02,160
Do you feel happy?
Do you feel happy that you're.

1044
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:02,910
Um,
and I,

1045
00:45:02,911 --> 00:45:06,680
I believe you are one of the people that
sort of an agent of this sort of,

1046
00:45:06,681 --> 00:45:08,000
uh,
I believe right now,

1047
00:45:08,001 --> 00:45:11,330
currently we're in a very unusual age of
enlightenment.

1048
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,230
And I think that the,
uh,

1049
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:18,390
the,
the level of enlightenment that we've 

1050
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:18,920
achieved a culturally over the last 
year.

1051
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:21,050
Certainly not everybody,
not last year,

1052
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:23,450
last decade,
certainly not over everybody,

1053
00:45:23,451 --> 00:45:28,451
but generally has been more than 
anything that I can ever remember in my 

1054
00:45:28,451 --> 00:45:32,771
lifetime.
And people like you that are pushing 

1055
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:35,501
these ideas and people like you that are
trying to challenge the way people view 

1056
00:45:35,501 --> 00:45:38,921
things and the standard standard,
a predetermined patterns of behavior we 

1057
00:45:38,921 --> 00:45:42,650
seem to have come to accept you're a 
part of moving this thing along these.

1058
00:45:42,771 --> 00:45:47,771
These kind of discussions are part of 
moving this thing along where people in 

1059
00:45:47,771 --> 00:45:48,680
college or people who are getting their 
first jobs,

1060
00:45:48,681 --> 00:45:53,681
people were starting their own first 
business versus they're stopping and 

1061
00:45:53,681 --> 00:45:56,150
they're reconsidering the direction that
they move forward and what their motives

1062
00:45:56,151 --> 00:45:58,550
are and whether or not they're just 
caught up in momentum.

1063
00:45:59,240 --> 00:45:59,740
Yeah,
man,

1064
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:03,890
I feel extremely humble and lucky.
Do you feel obligated?

1065
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:07,330
I feel tremendous obligation and 
responsibility to,

1066
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:09,350
um,
do what I can to help out,

1067
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:10,070
you know?

1068
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:13,730
So what is there a way to stop this?
What,

1069
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:15,570
what is the number one problem that we 
have?

1070
00:46:15,571 --> 00:46:18,810
If we have a urine for destruction and 
we're constantly.

1071
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:24,070
The number one problem that we have is 
that consciousness and subjectivity are 

1072
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:28,841
mass produced by a system that is 
basically keeping us in a state of a,

1073
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:32,360
you know,
pacivity and ignorance

1074
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:37,680
system.
A natural system is that system there 

1075
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,081
because like everything else,
like the way Alpha wolves treat Beta 

1076
00:46:40,081 --> 00:46:40,081
wolves,
that,

1077
00:46:40,081 --> 00:46:42,100
that,
that system is almost set up in place so

1078
00:46:42,101 --> 00:46:43,750
that there is an antagonist.
Sure.

1079
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:48,750
It's a,
I see it as an evolutionary process and 

1080
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:48,750
just as like,
you know,

1081
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:48,910
the,
the embryo has to push against the shell

1082
00:46:48,911 --> 00:46:50,300
and finally breakthrough,
you know,

1083
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:51,910
or doesn't,
um,

1084
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:54,820
inspired by an antagonist.
You,

1085
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:55,550
you,
Ali,

1086
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:56,410
you needed frazier.

1087
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,440
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1088
00:46:57,441 --> 00:46:57,940
I mean,
and,

1089
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:58,520
and,
and,

1090
00:46:58,521 --> 00:46:59,090
uh,
you know,

1091
00:46:59,091 --> 00:47:00,930
we definitely have a,
um,

1092
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:05,810
you know,
a powerful military industrial,

1093
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:10,870
corporate empire complex that has sunk 
its roots into our subconscious 

1094
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:16,030
processes and,
and our psychology and it is going to 

1095
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:19,231
require,
it requires a lot of disciplined effort 

1096
00:47:19,231 --> 00:47:22,390
to recognize how it is,
how it is operating through us on so 

1097
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:26,801
many different levels.
And then begin to turn it around from 

1098
00:47:26,801 --> 00:47:26,801
within.

1099
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,390
That's the facts,
pitches.

1100
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:29,980
That's about it.

1101
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:33,770
That's all you're going to absorb.
I haven't done this.

1102
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:39,630
This is an awesome conversation.
Thank you very much for coming over 

1103
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:39,630
here.
And my pleasure.

1104
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:43,340
Thanks for having me.
Everything that I thought it would be 

1105
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:45,220
plus more if anybody needs to get ahold 
of you or check out your stuff,

1106
00:47:45,221 --> 00:47:47,170
which should they do and what did,
what did you hand me here?

1107
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:50,900
I'll give you a quick rundown.
Evolver.net

1108
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:54,010
as our social network all over dot and 
they have the evolve or social movement.

1109
00:47:54,011 --> 00:47:56,110
We have about 50 groups around the world
now.

1110
00:47:56,111 --> 00:47:58,090
Mostly in the US who beat up every 
month.

1111
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:03,330
We do consciousness raising.
We create a theme that could be the 

1112
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:04,480
future of psychedelics.
It could be extra terrestrials,

1113
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:06,560
it could be sustainability or 
permaculture.

1114
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:11,990
We use those as both gathering points 
where people raise consciousness and 

1115
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:15,661
learn,
but then also nexus points for 

1116
00:48:15,661 --> 00:48:15,661
communities to build.

1117
00:48:15,661 --> 00:48:15,661
How long have you been doing evolver?
That's about,

1118
00:48:15,661 --> 00:48:16,300
uh,
it's been about three years.

1119
00:48:16,301 --> 00:48:18,090
You emailed me about this a long time 
ago.

1120
00:48:18,091 --> 00:48:20,700
His first sign,
but I'm so overwhelmed by me too.

1121
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:22,600
Don't worry about it though.
So it's like a facebook,

1122
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:25,720
like a psychedelic facebook kind of it,
it's a way for,

1123
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:26,710
you know,
it's a way for,

1124
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:30,370
for a kind of global community that's 
trying to understand this new paradigm.

1125
00:48:30,371 --> 00:48:32,740
And move into it to reach out to each 
other.

1126
00:48:32,741 --> 00:48:35,170
And then self organized.
Has Anybody ganged my name?

1127
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:36,740
My screen name?
Can I get my ice cream?

1128
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:38,530
We'll give you a beautiful.
Yeah.

1129
00:48:38,531 --> 00:48:41,950
And then we have a web magazine Reality 
Sandwich Sandwich [inaudible] dot com.

1130
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,890
[inaudible] DOT com.
We're doing live webinars.

1131
00:48:44,891 --> 00:48:48,220
We just did one on shamanism practices 
with Alberto Villoldo.

1132
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:52,360
So that's evolver intensives.com.
And now we're doing a line of books that

1133
00:48:52,361 --> 00:48:57,361
include this book here.
Jose Aguila says book manifesto for the 

1134
00:48:57,361 --> 00:48:57,820
newest sphere,
which is about this idea of a transition

1135
00:48:57,821 --> 00:49:00,040
from the biosphere two,
the noosphere.

1136
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:01,760
Nice.
And what is this,

1137
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,170
right?
You buy books and everything like that.

1138
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:04,690
Yeah,
for sure.

1139
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,670
I books I books,
so evolver additions.com

1140
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:09,280
and there's probably some other stuff on
unify earth.com

1141
00:49:09,281 --> 00:49:14,281
is this idea for this December 21st 2012
global event that people can actually 

1142
00:49:14,281 --> 00:49:14,800
sign up there.
A resource.

1143
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:17,300
What is that again?
This idea to use a search.

1144
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:19,920
What is the name of the site?
Unify earth.

1145
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,850
Unified.
Unified Earth Dot com.

1146
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:23,270
Also,
if you're into books,

1147
00:49:23,271 --> 00:49:25,550
breaking over the head was how I was 
introduced to Daniel.

1148
00:49:25,551 --> 00:49:28,820
It's a great book and I read half of 
Questo Quando.

1149
00:49:28,821 --> 00:49:31,910
I am a fucking add retired though and I 
put it down.

1150
00:49:31,911 --> 00:49:36,911
I'll pick it up again.
Now that we've had such an awesome 

1151
00:49:36,911 --> 00:49:36,911
conversation,
Daniel Pinchbeck on twitter,

1152
00:49:36,911 --> 00:49:41,860
please follow him on twitter along with 
following red band and follow the death 

1153
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:46,761
squad on itunes.
It's a fantastic podcast collection of 

1154
00:49:46,761 --> 00:49:47,960
comedian podcast collections depo on 
yesterday.

1155
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:53,050
Stephen was on yesterday.
There's a great show with John Repin 

1156
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:53,050
John from that.
He just started doing.

1157
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:54,770
There's.
Freddy Lockhart has a show called what's

1158
00:49:54,771 --> 00:49:56,060
good now.
There's already should.

1159
00:49:56,061 --> 00:50:01,061
Fear.
Has a great show called the skeptic 

1160
00:50:01,061 --> 00:50:02,591
tank.
Thompson and his woman Christina have 

1161
00:50:02,591 --> 00:50:02,591
the,
your mom's house.

1162
00:50:02,591 --> 00:50:03,380
And so there's a lot of great podcasts 
on there.

1163
00:50:03,381 --> 00:50:04,610
It's a lot of fun and solve of course.

All free of the Verizon Wireless Center.

Me and Joey Diaz and probably already 
too.

1166
00:50:10,161 --> 00:50:13,160
I haven't talked to him,
but the tickets just went on sale today.

1167
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:14,140
So,
uh,

1168
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,400
um,
we'll be there October seven.

1169
00:50:16,401 --> 00:50:18,780
Thank you very much Mr.
Pinchbeck through you guys.

1170
00:50:18,781 --> 00:50:19,820
I appreciate it.
Thank you very much.

1171
00:50:19,821 --> 00:50:21,590
To the fleshlight,
go to Joe Rogan.net.

1172
00:50:21,591 --> 00:50:23,630
Click on the link for the fleshlight.
Entering the code name,

1173

on,
sponsored by the fleshlight?

1175
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:28,650
Yes.
Yes.

1176
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,760
What did the flashlight do?
I get for sure.

1177
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:35,300
We're trying to combine seriousness,
legitimate thinking,

1178
00:50:35,301 --> 00:50:40,301
and completely ridiculous bullshit 
altogether in one soup to let people 

1179
00:50:40,301 --> 00:50:40,301
know,
enjoy it.

1180
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,320
Enjoy it bitches.
It ain't gonna last.

1181
