1
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,670
We'll live,
dude,

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,680
we always,
we always say we're going to do these 

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:16,810
regularly,
every like two or three years.

4
00:00:16,811 --> 00:00:20,200
We pledge that we will do these 
regularly and then a decade goes by.

5
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,310
We don't see each other,
but I hope that in your heart,

6
00:00:24,311 --> 00:00:29,311
just like mine,
that it's not like I've had enough of 

7
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:29,311
that.
Fuck.

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,080
No,
no.

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,660
I know how I see how busy you are.
You're one of the few people I follow on

10
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,510
instagram and I've said it on the 
previous show.

11
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,760
I just love to look at your life because
I'm like,

12
00:00:39,761 --> 00:00:44,761
fuck,
he's doing everything he wants and 

13
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:44,761
nothing I'd ever want to do,
but fuck.

14
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:46,090
He goes to the hill and not in a judgy 
way of like,

15
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,580
he shouldn't be doing that,
but just like,

16
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:48,430
you know,
you look,

17
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,450
I've said you live a man's life.
I live a boy's life as a 47 year old 

18
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:53,450
man.

19
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,080
So you do things like you got a float 
tank,

20
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,940
Johan,
you got to hug.

21
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:03,030
You know how to handle a bow and arrow.
I'm the guy that writes about people 

22
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:03,400
that shoot bow and arrows to stop 
crimes.

23
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:05,950
They usually have boxing gloves at the 
end of them and shit like that.

24
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,620
That's good to know.
But I,

25
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,630
I do,
I do.

26
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:16,230
I guess the point is I know you're busy 
as fuck and I know sometimes I get very 

27
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,891
busy as fuck,
but I think we only don't do this 

28
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:20,200
because of how busy we are.
Yeah,

29
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,720
that's all it is.
My very convoluted.

30
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,010
So that's.
Yes.

31
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,170
Yeah,
I'll buy that for me is for me,

32
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:26,980
for sure.
For me,

33
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:27,610
I'm like,
fuck,

34
00:01:27,611 --> 00:01:30,010
I could do that once a week because I'd 
walk away.

35
00:01:30,011 --> 00:01:33,670
I always walk away with a real,
like I've never done cocaine,

36
00:01:33,671 --> 00:01:36,790
but I imagine that's what it's like to 
do a line of cocaine off.

37
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,250
I don't know if somebody beautiful or 
something like that.

38
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,290
I always walk away with wisdom and it's 
wisdom that even though it's on a 

39
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,070
podcast and recorded and there's a 
record of like,

40
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:46,540
well,
that's where you learned those things.

41
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,330
I still go out into the world,
present them as my own,

42
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,090
like I'm a smart well read person out 
there.

43
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:54,910
There's dudes that have done a line of 
cocaine off someone and they're like,

44
00:01:54,911 --> 00:01:59,911
what the fuck is he telling you?
I've never learned anything from that 

45
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,780
except to do it better where the cocaine
doesn't quite fall into the ass crack or

46
00:02:01,781 --> 00:02:03,040
where.
Where'd all my money go?

47
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,000
To think that that was never my poison 
man and never.

48
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,220
I still have never in this lifetime done
knowingly done cocaine.

49
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,880
Somebody might've slipped it to me and 
you and I both really?

50
00:02:12,881 --> 00:02:13,750
Yeah.
I never touched it,

51
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,610
but one time in man,
that's fucking,

52
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,390
you know what I'm saying?

53
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,320
Like,
oh,

54
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,760
were rare.
Yeah.

55
00:02:18,761 --> 00:02:21,520
And also just like as entertainers were 
rare as well,

56
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:26,521
does it ever make you feel less than 
when you read about those of us who try 

57
00:02:26,711 --> 00:02:31,711
to be funny in this business and those 
who have been insanely successful and 

58
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:32,650
become icons,
they always have,

59
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:37,710
you know,
and then they did blow for hours and 

60
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:37,710
blah blah,
blah.

61
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,320
Do you ever feel like,
oh,

62
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:42,330
that's not part of my matrix,
hence I must not be one of the greats.

63
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,380
No,
I'm very lucky that I know that.

64
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:49,381
You don't feel that.
I don't feel that right because I think 

65
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:49,420
I'd have a real problem with speed and 
amphetamines and coke.

66
00:02:49,421 --> 00:02:54,421
I think I'd have a real problem.
That's what draws your eye like from a 

67
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:54,421
distance.
I really don't enjoy it.

68
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:58,730
Um,
and I think it's the worst thing for 

69
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,670
someone like me who's up probably person
to begin with,

70
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,350
you know,
which has served me well.

71
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,130
But,
but um,

72
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,940
that stuff makes you giggle,
giggle.

73
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:11,941
Not because it's not facetious is if you
walked into the facility that I just 

74
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:16,591
walked into and had the grand tour that 
you were given a gentle listener and 

75
00:03:16,591 --> 00:03:17,060
watcher at home.
Uh,

76
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,360
I was,
I was saying to joe before we went,

77
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:21,280
like,
he's got this new new to me.

78
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,080
I don't know how long you been here 
since October you said?

79
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,350
Yeah.
But it's,

80
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,390
it's a paradise.
It's a,

81
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,660
you know,
fuck the term man cave.

82
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,480
This is like man empire and walk in and 
it's just,

83
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,810
it's like walking into Joe's head.
It's everything he loves under one 

84
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,720
fucking roof.
And I said it to him before,

85
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:43,140
like you did this with your mouth,
like you talked yourself into this.

86
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,160
Very strange.
Isn't that awesome?

87
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,470
I mean,
I know you've gotten,

88
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,500
you've got a zillion things that you do,
but like even in a world of the MMA 

89
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,180
stuff,
that's still your mouth.

90
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:57,420
It's always your fucking mouth that is 
taking you from where you started til 

91
00:03:57,461 --> 00:04:02,461
now you walk into this building.
It's not like he had a family fortune 

92
00:04:02,461 --> 00:04:04,810
and it was willed to them.
Your mouth put you in a building.

93
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,970
This nice painted the walls,
the color it is.

94
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:09,130
You walk in,
it's like a museum.

95
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:13,630
It's like you see pieces of of him hence
me all over the fucking place.

96
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,900
That's all out of your mouth.
If anybody's watching or listening at 

97
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,960
home,
teetering on the verge of like,

98
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:24,961
I wonder if I should do a podcast.
Send them a snapshot of that fucking 

99
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:26,170
room where you can launch bow and arrows
for 45 yards.

100
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,350
They'll start talking.
But I think if you're interested in at 

101
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,440
all,
you should do a podcast talk to you.

102
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,240
It can be.
It can be a way to make a living.

103
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,340
There's enough people like this.

104
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,200
I'm not a one of those,
um,

105
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,270
famine thinkers.
I think the opposite.

106
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,340
Like you could do it.
Anybody can do it.

107
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:43,030
I've never like,
man,

108
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:44,810
it might not be enough for everybody.
I agree.

109
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,220
I'm always the guy who encourages you to
like,

110
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,190
hey,
try it because,

111
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:49,810
oh my God,
it's fucking fun for me.

112
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,370
And you know,
we've been,

113
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,400
we're rare birds and as much as we've 
been around since the fucking art forum 

114
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,641
started,
like you've been doing podcasts since a 

115
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:03,710
minute after podcasts start.
At first he was the Guy Predate Corolla.

116
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,390
Yeah.
Well,

117
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:05,220
yeah,
for sure.

118
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,800
So,
but you're in the first five years you 

119
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:10,800
were.
Well,

120
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,640
what year did you start?
I started,

121
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:15,400
we just celebrated.
Last year was our 10th anniversary,

122
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,440
so we're now a year 11.
So count back from now is two one.

123
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,470
Oh,
seven years.

124
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,740
Couple of years.
When did you begin?

125
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,240
Think?
Two thousand nine.

126
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,990
It was in two years of the Big Bang when
I,

127
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:34,020
when I jumped in,
it was Leo Laporte doing this week in 

128
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,761
tech and I think he still does that and 
the happy tree friends and that was like

129
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:43,981
the apple podcast,
top five and then me and Scott started 

130
00:05:43,981 --> 00:05:46,570
with smog cast and then later on we 
added a bunch of stuff,

131
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:51,750
but getting in within the first two 
years like we happened and then right on

132
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:56,350
the heels of us,
Adam was on the radio and that radio job

133
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,070
went away and where

134
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,820
Adam went to podcasting gotta be 2000 if
we started smart guests,

135
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:04,280
2007.
It's either in.

136
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:09,310
We start February 2007.
Either he loses the Radio Gig in 2007 

137
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,180
and moves the pockets or it happens in 
2008,

138
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:13,070
but it was,
isn't that neighborhood?

139
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,030
Yes,
and he's.

140
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:18,470
He was the model for a lot of folks now,
like Ralph Garman,

141
00:06:18,471 --> 00:06:20,810
the guy that I do Hollywood babble.
I love Ralph.

142
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:24,520
Ralph's amazing.
He was let go byK rock earlier this year

143
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:25,060
or later.
Yeah,

144
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,170
at the end of last year.
Right before Christmas.

145
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,220
And so he to moved into a kind of online
world.

146
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:36,830
It can sustain a motherfucker.
Ralph's report is his show.

147
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,370
I liked him a lot.
He's a good dude.

148
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,580
Good Dude.
But I'm talking to him when you,

149
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,910
when you go to k rock and that's how our
friendship began.

150
00:06:44,911 --> 00:06:48,620
And you sit there doing the show and 
then afterwards I was a cigarette smoker

151
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:53,621
in those days and we'd sit there out in 
the parking lot and smoke and slowly 

152
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:57,100
like I remember I came in once k rock 
just announced like,

153
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,320
Hey,
I've rented a theater on Santa Monica 

154
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,040
Boulevard and we're calling it smart 
cast when going,

155
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,470
we're the world's first live podcasting 
theater,

156
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,630
then we're going to do podcasts there 
and stuff.

157
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,650
And so Ralph was listening,
he's right there.

158
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:18,130
And then uh,
like months prior he had approached me 

159
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:18,130
and he's like,
hey man,

160
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,970
would you ever want to do like the 
Showbiz beat?

161
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:24,110
That's what he used to do on k rock on 
Kevin and been like as a Saturday show.

162
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,040
And I was like,
Fuck Ya,

163
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,350
hear myself on the radio.
That'd be fantastic.

164
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,800
So we recorded a demo for the show,
gave it to his bosses and his bosses 

165
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,680
were like,
nobody wants to listen to people talk on

166
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:36,920
the radio anymore.
And so it died there.

167
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:41,921
Just like how years ago things died when
you couldn't get past a gatekeeper who 

168
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:43,280
was like,
we don't want your shit.

169
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:47,390
Was this after the talk radio station in
La went under this.

170
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:52,620
Okay.
So they probably were like current on 

171
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:52,720
that and they were just,
you know,

172
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,460
k rock was reading the tea leaves,
which was like,

173
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,400
people don't want to hear people cheer.

174
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,930
This won't play music.
We're competing with satellite radio now

175
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:04,931
we're competing with streaming music 
where it's like they don't have to wait 

176
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:07,340
15 minutes to hear a song.
Dan could shows though runway steckler.

177
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,000
That was a really good show.
Yeah,

178
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,540
they were great.
There was a bunch of really good shows.

179
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,030
But the uh,
so he,

180
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,410
we had tried that and it was called 
Showbiz beat.

181
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,720
And then months later when I was in 
there going like,

182
00:08:20,721 --> 00:08:25,721
yeah,
I'm opening this podcast theater 

183
00:08:25,721 --> 00:08:26,030
afterwards in the parking lot,
grabbing the post show smoke.

184
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:27,590
Ralph is just like,
hey,

185
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:31,010
would you ever want to try that radio 
show at that theater?

186
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,390
And I was like,
fuck yeah,

187
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:34,310
you want to do it as a podcast?
And he was like,

188
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:34,970
yeah,
like yeah,

189
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:39,971
let's try it out.
And so I was driving home and I texted 

190
00:08:39,971 --> 00:08:44,231
him at a light.
I said we could call it Hollywood 

191
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:44,231
Babylon.

192
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:49,040
It was an old book called Hollywood 
Babylon that was about like gossipy 

193
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,520
stories about Hollywood people and 
stuff,

194
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,790
but we spell that of course differently 
and stuff and that was my.

195
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,650
That's what I brought to Babylon.
Other than that,

196
00:08:55,651 --> 00:09:00,651
Ralph built that entire thing and then 
my job became to sit next to them and 

197
00:09:00,651 --> 00:09:05,331
react to the news,
which is why I love that part so much 

198
00:09:05,331 --> 00:09:06,540
because as you can tell,
I fucking love the sound of my voice and

199
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,620
I wind up talking,
talking,

200
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:12,650
talking on smog casts.
I would lead on Jay and silent Bob get 

201
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:12,870
old,
which is really about Jason Muse.

202
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:17,871
I wound up wind up talking a bunch,
but with Babylon I get to sit there 

203
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:21,300
while he's the main act and I'm,
you know,

204
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,930
the second banana,
I,

205
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:27,950
it's,
it's nice to be able to top and bottom 

206
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,200
in the world of podcasting,
like you know,

207
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,900
it,
it's,

208
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,590
it gives you a place to go if I'm 
tapping all the time,

209
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:34,860
right.

210
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,860
That I'm talking about my thoughts and 
what I believe in and these are the 

211
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:39,860
experiences I've had and people are 
interested in that.

212
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,530
But then sometimes you just want to 
check out and talk about somebody else's

213
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:45,750
shit.
None a podcast we do call fat man.

214
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,800
I'm battling.
That's what we do.

215
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:48,690
I just sit around and go like,
oh my God,

216
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:50,220
you watched the avengers and shit like 
that.

217
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,410
So you get to concentrate on that kind 
of stuff.

218
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:57,411
So yeah,
the Babylon thing grew insanely 

219
00:09:57,411 --> 00:09:57,411
organically.
We started that little theater,

220
00:09:57,411 --> 00:10:01,880
sat 48 people and since he was on the 
radio every morning he can just fucking 

221
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,160
sell it out.
He'd be like,

222
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:03,810
Hey,
go to Kevin's website.

223
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,900
You get tickets for battle and be sold.
This is that you placed on.

224
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,140
What was it?
It was somewhere in West Hollywood,

225
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:11,220
right?
That little theater.

226
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,040
It was on.

227
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:17,870
Yeah,
it was on Santa Monica Boulevard in an 

228
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,440
area of where they put up a few black 
box theaters.

229
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:24,441
This,
this section is called the complex and 

230
00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:27,561
we had one theater in the complex and 
repainted it and hung up like all the 

231
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:32,391
artwork,
like you got our work based on the 

232
00:10:32,391 --> 00:10:32,391
podcast out in the hallway.
Same thing.

233
00:10:32,391 --> 00:10:34,530
We were essentially built a shrine to 
Scott Mosier,

234
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:36,190
my cohost,
smart kids,

235
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,580
which I'm sure on some level creeped him
the fuck out.

236
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:41,760
First time he walked in was just like,
he wants to wear my skin,

237
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:47,230
you know,
and so the idea was we're going to do 

238
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,461
nothing but smart cast here.
But since Scott didn't suddenly go into 

239
00:10:49,461 --> 00:10:49,680
like,
yeah,

240
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:51,120
let's do five podcasts a week,
you know,

241
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:56,140
it stayed pretty much the same.
We had a theater with nothing going on 

242
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,420
and it and stuff.
So I started trying other things.

243
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,650
Babylon became one of them.
Jay and silent Bob get old also came out

244
00:11:01,651 --> 00:11:03,550
of that experience.
Still have that theater.

245
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,120
We let go of that.
Me and Maddie Cohen,

246
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:10,110
who's a cohost on this very fun podcast 
he does with Macaulay Culkin.

247
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:11,640
Have you spoken to fucking Macaulay 
Culkin?

248
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:14,790
Ya know,
I'm just putting a bug in your ear.

249
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,640
Oh fuck dude.
Fuck.

250
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,040
He gives good talk.
Good oral.

251
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,450
I mean that sounds filthier than I meant
to,

252
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:23,100
but you know what I'm saying?
Like as a guest.

253
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,480
Fucking fascinating and funny and it.
Anyway,

254
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:31,170
Matt and Macaulay do a podcast called 
bunny ears,

255
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:35,930
and so Matt Cohen was the guy that I'd 
opened smog castle with like guy going,

256
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,330
I wish I had a black box theater and 
went out and found it and stuff.

257
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,970
So we kept it open for like one year and
then let it go.

258
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:46,971
Because what had happened was the Babel 
show sold so well so quickly all the 

259
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:50,460
time that it became clear,
like we move this to a bigger theater.

260
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:52,590
This is the thing.
He was on the radio all the time,

261
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:54,040
so it was easy to move seats.

262
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,610
So we went up to the lovetts member,
Jon Lovitz Comedy Club.

263
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,210
Ralph had went to the Improv and in 
love.

264
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:06,211
It's the love.
It's with like you could have 95 or 100 

265
00:12:06,211 --> 00:12:09,151
percent of the doors,
something ridiculous and that was the 

266
00:12:09,151 --> 00:12:09,390
only reason we went up there with air 
for awhile.

267
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,610
Things fell out with Lovitz and stuff 
and then we moved to the Improv instead.

268
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:17,611
So we've been there ever since and now 
we do it on the road quite a bit and 

269
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,330
stuff.
It's always weird,

270
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:24,331
right,
because the people were way above your 

271
00:12:24,331 --> 00:12:25,681
head.
It was one level here and one level way 

272
00:12:25,681 --> 00:12:28,470
was meant to be.
It was bb king's originally back in the 

273
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,520
day,
so it's like a jazz club where you 

274
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,901
wouldn't mind looking down at the act 
but for a podcast and with a guy with a 

275
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:36,910
fucking bald spot.
It was nerve wracking because like,

276
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:41,911
how am I supposed to be funny knowing 
they're staring down at me judging my 

277
00:12:41,911 --> 00:12:41,911
bald spot.

278
00:12:41,911 --> 00:12:43,480
Some comedy shows there and it was 
great,

279
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:48,481
but it was.
It was odd because it was a weird shape 

280
00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:48,481
tray flap and straighten up.
Let me.

281
00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:51,310
I'm just jump off topic real quick.
What were you.

282
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:56,340
Was it the times you were featured in 
for being like the source for news?

283
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,280
It's this thing that these guys are.
They're they're,

284
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:06,090
they're calling something to 
intellectual dark web and they've 

285
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,660
connected a bunch of people together 
that are interesting.

286
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:12,661
People that don't follow poor standard 
for name bad marketing because when I 

287
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,540
read it I was like,
I don't think of him as dark web.

288
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,850
The dark web.
My friend,

289
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:21,780
I think of Weinstein.
She loves that sneaky.

290
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,610
You can dagger type stuff.
He came up with the name of it.

291
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:29,790
He just gets a kick out of it I think,
but essentially the piece was about how 

292
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,481
you are doing media that the quote 
unquote real media is not doing like you

293
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:39,390
know more about the rise of certain 
intellectuals that are very 

294
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:42,931
controversial like Jordan Peterson and 
Sam Harris and all the debate about 

295
00:13:42,931 --> 00:13:42,931
them.

296
00:13:42,931 --> 00:13:46,150
I'm just someone who they get a chance 
to talk to for three hours,

297
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,640
you know,
in a pretty well.

298
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:54,220
Well we'll subscribe to base is a lot of
people that are going to listen to these

299
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:55,660
conversations and they get it.
They go,

300
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:55,980
well,
why?

301
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,060
Why haven't I heard people talk like 
this before?

302
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:02,240
Why haven't I heard about the idea of 
determinism versus freewill?

303
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:07,290
Why?
Why haven't I heard like last time we 

304
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,650
were here,
we talked about the universal monetary.

305
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,590
Everybody starts with a salary.
Yeah.

306
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:15,160
Universal basic income.
I was super hesitant about that.

307
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:16,210
I was like,
that's nonsense.

308
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,770
And then,
um,

309
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,000
the more I thought about it,
I,

310
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,880
whenever I just immediately dismiss 
something,

311
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,990
I always have to go,
okay,

312
00:14:22,991 --> 00:14:25,720
why?
Why am I immediately dismissing it?

313
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,250
Like,
what's,

314
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,000
what's,
what,

315
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:28,290
why did I go?
And then I thought,

316
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,440
oh,
that's fucking people.

317
00:14:29,441 --> 00:14:30,750
They're just lazy.
They just want money.

318
00:14:30,751 --> 00:14:31,430
And then I went,
all right,

319
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:36,430
is that true?
Let me see what the fuck's going on.

320
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,190
Because there's a weird reaction that I 
had.

321
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:40,090
Like I had a reaction against lazy 
people.

322
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,340
The unexamined life is not worth living,
so it's easy enough for you to be like,

323
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:49,350
now I don't care.
But most people end their and their 

324
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,350
story goes in a different direction.
You're like,

325
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,160
wait,
why don't I didn't have a clear defense?

326
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,160
My actions,

327
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,780
the way I thought not,
you know,

328
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,770
I didn't do anything but the way I 
considered this subject,

329
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,260
I didn't have.
I didn't have a real bay.

330
00:15:00,261 --> 00:15:02,570
I was very knee jerk,
so I said,

331
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:07,571
okay,
let me really examine this and what the 

332
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:12,740
real issue I think is going to be 
automation and artificial intelligence.

333
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,210
I think it's going to remove a 
tremendous amount of jobs.

334
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:22,510
I think automation in terms of a car 
driving and a different use,

335
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:28,340
different functions.
Once they get better at robotics and 

336
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,040
being able to do things and then people 
will be less and less necessary and they

337
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,540
have a real problem.
They think with cars,

338
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:37,870
with a number of males that drive cars,
it's in the millions for a job and that 

339
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,560
they would all like almost instantly be 
out of work if they ever get these 

340
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,890
automated cars down and where everybody.

341
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:50,890
I mean one,
since we're a culture that believes in 

342
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:51,920
technology,
one's inclined to believe,

343
00:15:51,921 --> 00:15:56,921
oh,
they will get these self driving 

344
00:15:56,921 --> 00:15:57,070
vehicles down to a science.
I think they'll get it down there.

345
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:02,280
They're pretty damn close.
Close by fact that as soon as somebody 

346
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,491
gets it right,
they get set back a couple of hundred 

347
00:16:06,491 --> 00:16:07,670
miles.
There's been a few fatalities,

348
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,900
right?
Several.

349
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,040
But how many have been fatalities 
because of humans,

350
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,220
and I always say that's true,
but how many more humans are driving 

351
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,240
that fucking robots.
I mean that shit is off the charts and 

352
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,540
that number's got to be banana.
It's like how many actual robots are out

353
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,550
there driving?
When he got 10 and two of them killed,

354
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,990
people settled down,
but it's still.

355
00:16:27,991 --> 00:16:29,750
If you.
If you look at the numbers though,

356
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,690
yeah,
billions of people driving cars.

357
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,350
Only 10 robots and they've already taken
two lives,

358
00:16:35,351 --> 00:16:36,440
so that's pretty.

359
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,850
It was a pretty bad ass,
bro.

360
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,090
That's what's going to happen.
I believe that.

361
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:46,150
I've been talking about this a lot.
There's a fucking robot that I'm a Darpa

362
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:50,870
created and it's called the eater robot.
EA T R,

363
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:56,260
and it can fucking fuel itself with the 
biological material.

364
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,190
Any or is it programmed for certain 
biological material?

365
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,170
No Man,
but biological computer.

366
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,440
Dead bodies,
no doubt.

367
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:09,920
But does that mean that a,
it's aware of when it's powering down?

368
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,680
I don't know.
Here's remember either the military role

369
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:14,720
at this supposed to eat humans.
His is the thing.

370
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:20,230
I think the idea of biological material 
is maybe it could sustain itself on 

371
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,860
plants.
Maybe you could sustain.

372
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,420
Go.
It's possible.

373
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:26,030
It's possible you went right to human 
remains possible.

374
00:17:26,031 --> 00:17:31,031
If you can use this thing in a 
battlefield that you would want to have 

375
00:17:31,031 --> 00:17:31,700
it eat people because you can have dead 
people everywhere.

376
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,030
Have this fucking robot monster that 
you're sending to kill people.

377
00:17:35,031 --> 00:17:37,670
Also eat them.
So not only is it killing people,

378
00:17:37,671 --> 00:17:40,370
but it's also cleaning up in the 
background as well.

379
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:45,550
Taking dead bodies away.
I was a diabolical scientists and I was 

380
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:49,001
going to come up with the evilest mean 
his shit to to send to the enemy to go 

381
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,010
them.
It will be a

382
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,100
robot that eats people.
Why?

383
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,230
Because it's going to kill people,
right?

384
00:17:55,231 --> 00:18:00,231
It's going to be sent there that killed 
your loved one watch in horror as a 

385
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:07,040
consumer.
It's flush and power me further fuel to 

386
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,530
kill you next.
And wouldn't we?

387
00:18:07,531 --> 00:18:12,531
I mean pretty bad and and kind of 
stereotypical and one might even say 

388
00:18:12,531 --> 00:18:14,160
racist robot voice.
I apologize for the race.

389
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:16,740
What race would that be?
Monotone.

390
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,740
I feel no love nor are paid and they can
make it look scary to man.

391
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:27,560
They can make it look like venom like 
from a star wars books or spiderman,

392
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,430
Spiderman,
books that would be scary to people.

393
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,780
Be like,
Holy Fuck venoms here.

394
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:32,170
This rock.
It would be pretty close.

395
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:37,210
Our Denim Fan.
It needs to look like that face the 

396
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,030
giant face with the wind.
I mean that.

397
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:43,410
If that was in the eater robot and just 
inside all that scare you,

398
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,670
would that scare you more or would it 
scare you more if there were like,

399
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,050
uh,
the eater robot,

400
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,260
its head is full of hypodermic needles.
Each one more toxic than the last and 

401
00:18:55,231 --> 00:18:57,240
infected at a moment's touch.

402
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,870
Whoa.
Those are terrible too.

403
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,290
You know,
it's.

404
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,790
Do you want to try option or do you want
to greet by the sharks?

405
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,540
Which question

406
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,100
have you spoken about Roseanne yet?
I'm not publicly.

407
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:16,410
Have you had private conversations?
Is enough to form some sort of thought 

408
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,130
process on it.
I talked to Ben Shapiro about it today 

409
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:19,170
on his show,
but it won't be out until Sunday.

410
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,400
What is,
um,

411
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:25,510
do you,
have you ever encountered her in the 

412
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:25,510
world?
I know Roseanne,

413
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:29,230
um,
I talked to her on the phone and I 

414
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,431
believe every word she said she told me 
that she was taking the Ambien and that 

415
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:37,021
she was drunk and Memorial Day weekend 
and she tweeted a bunch of stupid shit 

416
00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:38,470
and she's out of her fucking mind and 
she said,

417
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,390
you know,
in her words,

418
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,210
I need to adjust my meds,
you know,

419
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:48,270
I'm not thinking straight.
And she was talking about how exhausted 

420
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,541
she got doing that television show and 
she got bronchitis and she was 

421
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:52,630
overworked.
I think she's stressing the fuck out.

422
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,230
She also told me that she did not know 
that that lady was even black.

423
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,000
She thought that lady was Jewish and she
said to me like,

424
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,350
do you really think that I would make a 
joke about a black lady and say,

425
00:20:02,351 --> 00:20:04,210
planet aches,
I wouldn't fucking do that.

426
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,710
She's like,
I thought she was Jewish.

427
00:20:05,711 --> 00:20:10,711
Look at her,
so I did look at her like pull up her 

428
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:11,050
wikipedia page.
This lady,

429
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,870
she,
um,

430
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,310
I mean she most certainly pull it up so 
we could see it.

431
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,640
I mean she most certainly could be 
African American for sure,

432
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:29,730
but she also most certainly could be 
like Hawaiian or native American or

433
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,280
point ban the Italian.
Maybe she thought Jewish.

434
00:20:33,281 --> 00:20:34,540
Those what Roseanne said?
Jewish.

435
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,580
This is what she said.
I do not know.

436
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,450
I don't think she's lying to me.
I don't think she's racist.

437
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,020
Have you ever had an Ambien?
No,

438
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:47,030
I've never taken him,
but I talked to here ever taken a good 

439
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:47,080
friend of mine about it today and he

440
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,010
got up

441
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,490
in the middle of the night,
cooked himself a meal,

442
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,480
eight it,
went to sleep,

443
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:55,630
got up in the morning and had no 
recollection of it.

444
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:00,660
He had to be told that he did.
He was trying to figure out who put the 

445
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,780
plates in the sink,
who ate this food,

446
00:21:01,781 --> 00:21:03,370
where this food comes from and couldn't 
figure it out.

447
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,130
He got up in the middle of the night,
doesn't remember a thing,

448
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,960
right.
And cooked himself a meal,

449
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,100
sat down,
ate,

450
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,530
and went back to bed at zero 
recollection of it.

451
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,730
I said to this guy,
they shit out of it during that meal.

452
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:17,460
At any point did he get racist or 
anything like that?

453
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,080
I wonder,
you know what I'm saying?

454
00:21:19,081 --> 00:21:22,440
Like he's literally buckets one thing 
and it's a spooky story.

455
00:21:22,441 --> 00:21:27,441
It'd be like,
I took ambien and I made myself some 

456
00:21:27,441 --> 00:21:27,441
food.
It's an even spookier story to be like,

457
00:21:27,441 --> 00:21:28,590
I took ambien and I fucking killed 
somebody.

458
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,190
But it's a,
it's a stretch to be like it is.

459
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,520
I took ambien and I said something I 
would never say in a million years.

460
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:40,550
It heartens me to hear you say that she 
said that she wasn't aware of the ladies

461
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,990
race because it,
you know,

462
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,160
I don't know her all.
I know her from his Roseanne.

463
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:52,220
Oh,
I know her from his decades of watching 

464
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,310
her and media or TV show.
I followed it before the TV show.

465
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,880
Um,
it didn't seem like

466
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,130
the Roseanne that I've watched for 30,
40 years.

467
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:02,810
Well see,
that's the thing.

468
00:22:02,811 --> 00:22:07,811
I'm not close to her on a daily basis.
I have tremendous respect for her as a 

469
00:22:07,811 --> 00:22:09,020
comedian.
Um,

470
00:22:09,021 --> 00:22:14,021
I think she's,
she was a real pioneer and a lot of 

471
00:22:14,021 --> 00:22:14,021
ways.
She was this brash,

472
00:22:14,021 --> 00:22:18,850
like really confident lady who shit on 
stupid men and she did it and it's like 

473
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,800
really bold way and stand up.
That was very unique for the time.

474
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:30,070
I think if people go back and you watch 
some of her early standup when she was 

475
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,470
coming out of Denver,
the domestic goddess,

476
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,790
she was a beast man.
She was obese.

477
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,090
She was crushing,
she was crushing,

478
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,120
you know,
and then she got that Sitcom and it's 

479
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,120
absolutely one of the greatest sitcoms 
of all time.

480
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,890
Yeah.
But now she's 65 years old and it's 

481
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,340
fucking hard for her.
And that schedule she was telling me was

482
00:22:46,341 --> 00:22:49,550
absolutely brutal and that they were 
killing her with all the work.

483
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I don't know her very well,
but I do know there was another time 

484
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,120
where she said something about Susan 
Rice who is a,

485
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,050
another African American woman.
And she,

486
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,040
she said something about her and 
compared to her balls.

487
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:09,010
Yeah.
Something like swinging eight balls,

488
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,460
you know.
So that's two for two.

489
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,020
It's two.
Yeah.

490
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,790
Well this one for sure.
Right?

491
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:17,580
Because this one,
there's no excuse for this.

492
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,500
This is one from the past that there was
no.

493
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,490
Like,
oh my God,

494
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,930
I was on Ambien.
I tweeted this.

495
00:23:22,931 --> 00:23:27,931
No one said anything.
Susan Rice is a man with a big swinging 

496
00:23:27,931 --> 00:23:27,931
ape balls

497
00:23:27,931 --> 00:23:29,890
and that wasn't meant to be a 
compliment.

498
00:23:29,891 --> 00:23:31,060
I guess.
13.

499
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,190
Okay.
So that's a long time ago.

500
00:23:33,191 --> 00:23:34,870
That's five years ago.
Oh,

501
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,000
and you can,
I mean,

502
00:23:36,001 --> 00:23:39,040
I don't know if it's still available,
but if you can go through a timeline and

503
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:42,700
see a bunch of things that are not like 
a comedian being funny,

504
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:43,400
but.
Right.

505
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,340
You know,
beliefs,

506
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:45,890
right.

507
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,590
That one is um,
doubts are rough.

508
00:23:48,591 --> 00:23:50,840
One.
That to me is a way rougher one.

509
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,720
It's way rougher.
Like that one is like,

510
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:56,420
that's what you said.
I mean it is what it is.

511
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:01,510
You know,
if you said that the other lady looked 

512
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:01,510
like planet of the apes just because of 
her haircut,

513
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,800
because she looks like the lead woman in
Sierra.

514
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,180
Yeah.
She looked like zero.

515
00:24:05,181 --> 00:24:08,660
There was like a photo of her back.
It was just like the way her haircut was

516
00:24:08,661 --> 00:24:12,090
and her outfit was.
I think some people would,

517
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,750
but if you didn't know that she was 
black,

518
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,450
it's a totally different thing.
Yeah.

519
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,250
Do we know that for sure.
You know,

520
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,120
only she knows for sure.
You know?

521
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,200
Are you surprised at how quickly it all 
ended?

522
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:30,380
Well that was the part of the story that
again,

523
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:35,381
I have no skin in the game other than I 
watched the old Roseanne and I was 

524
00:24:35,381 --> 00:24:39,761
enjoying the new Roseanne as well,
but I came home from like I was vegas 

525
00:24:39,761 --> 00:24:44,351
the other day and I flew home yesterday 
morning and then I had a meeting over 

526
00:24:44,351 --> 00:24:47,480
the studios like at noon,
so I took a nap when I go home,

527
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:52,770
like,
and also my wife wakes me up and she 

528
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:52,770
goes,
you got a meeting,

529
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:53,390
don't forget like it's 1130.
Oh.

530
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,670
And Roseanne's been canceled and I'm 
like,

531
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,650
that's,
that's impossible.

532
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,860
Like I was groggy,
but I'm like that's impossible.

533
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,990
It's like 20 million people are watching
that show.

534
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,750
And she said she tweeted something 
racist,

535
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,540
so I'm fucking pick up my phone and I 
look at it and stuff.

536
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:13,600
And by the time like this had happened 
in the span of like the hour I took a 

537
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:15,780
fucking nap.
They,

538
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:18,890
the network acted so fucking incredibly 
fast.

539
00:25:18,891 --> 00:25:20,730
There was no prevarication equivocation.
No.

540
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,910
Do they have that ax sharpened and 
ready?

541
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,430
It was not like all of a sudden they 
were just like,

542
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,860
we're done.
We don't know or disavow.

543
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:28,830
And,
and,

544
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:33,890
and it was,
I think it was so surprising because 

545
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:38,050
it's been awhile since somebody did 
something even superficially a moral,

546
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,480
you know what I'm saying?
Like I've read a lot of articles online 

547
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:46,480
where people are like,
hey man,

548
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,380
abc didn't own the show.
So of course they fucking had,

549
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,950
didn't have as much skin in the game.
So it was easy for them to cancel it.

550
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,750
Would they have canceled with this fast?
If they own the show and dot,

551
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:54,470
dot dot,
you can,

552
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:59,710
you can make a bunch of kind of caveats.
But at the end of the day something bad 

553
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:03,410
happened and then the network reacted.
A major come fuck the network.

554
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,730
A major company,
Major Corporation reacted.

555
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:09,850
That is the right way to handle it,
to just immediately cancel the show.

556
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,960
I personally would have maybe fired her 
and kept everybody else done.

557
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:15,920
Like the,
you know,

558
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:19,290
Valerie never die off or just use 
computer animation.

559
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:22,080
I could replace it with the pixars 
character,

560
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:27,081
but I think you can sell it equally 
compelling stories like without her 

561
00:26:27,081 --> 00:26:28,980
honestly like the nine episodes that 
they've done this season.

562
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:32,660
She really hasn't been the driving 
factor of stories.

563
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:37,670
It's been more about Darlene.
That's who I felt bad for when this 

564
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,040
whole thing imploded because I'm like,
she's.

565
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,640
She put this show together.
Sarah Gilbert,

566
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,030
and she was crushing on it.
She was like

567
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:49,040
really good.
Showing off like what a great actress 

568
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,040
she is,
but now everybody's out of job.

569
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,191
Feel bad for John Goodman.
I've worked with him before and he was 

570
00:26:52,191 --> 00:26:54,000
wonderful on the show.
Could sustain the show without her.

571
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:55,590
I think.
Can She be forgiven?

572
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:57,660
Sure.
I mean,

573
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:02,680
Ken,
didn't Mel Gibson get forgiven as any 

574
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:02,680
working again?
Mel,

575
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,051
Mel Gibson,
it was also a case of him being 

576
00:27:06,051 --> 00:27:06,750
intoxicated right.
He was yelling some antisemitic stuff at

577
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:07,400
a cop.
I mean,

578
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:12,470
nevermind.
That also punch his ex wife like 

579
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,220
violence action than him just saying,
hey,

580
00:27:14,221 --> 00:27:19,221
sugar tits.
Like there were some that his wife had 

581
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,160
recorded them or recording them,
yelling at her on the phone.

582
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,340
So we had nobody knows if he truly hit,
I don't know,

583
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,420
my bed.
I thought that was,

584
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,770
I don't know.
I don't know.

585
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,800
I don't know the,
even the specifics of any accusation and

586
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:32,340
also I also didn't follow it that 
closely and not because I'm like,

587
00:27:32,341 --> 00:27:37,341
man,
that's Martin Riggs and I don't want to 

588
00:27:37,341 --> 00:27:37,341
hear anything bad about him.

589
00:27:37,341 --> 00:27:37,341
I just didn't follow it because I'm 
like,

590
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,480
yeah man,
it's,

591
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,200
can she be forgiven,
forgiven?

592
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:44,700
I don't know.
I mean look,

593
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,650
she should have tweeted what you said 
instead of a,

594
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:51,360
Oh my God,
I took ambien.

595
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,480
Like that turned into an opportunity for
a major pharmaceutical company to put 

596
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:59,390
out one of the best singers twitter's 
ever seen.

597
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,640
Like this is a company they're not 
normally used to like,

598
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,740
hey,
what should we say to be funny?

599
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:08,400
Like they have to put out very staid 
information and for once they were like,

600
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:12,340
how about this guys?
We say racism isn't a byproduct of.

601
00:28:12,341 --> 00:28:15,030
It was really well said.
There was this was well worded.

602
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,190
You sit there and go like,
why didn't I tweet that?

603
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,290
Whoever wrote it,
it was whoever wrote it rather.

604
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:23,490
It's pretty slick.
I'm the thing ambient does do though and

605
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:25,560
definitely makes you act bizarre.

606
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,050
You.
There's some sleep,

607
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,110
sleep.
I mean if you just.

608
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:35,160
There's a smoke weed,
eat edibles.

609
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,360
That would help,
right?

610
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:41,750
There's websites dedicated to people 
that have had crazy experiences on that 

611
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:41,750
stuff.
I've seen a few of those stories.

612
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,760
The one that you told me about your 
friend cooking dinner is about the 

613
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,270
fourth time somebody communicate that 
story now because they've been listening

614
00:28:48,271 --> 00:28:50,520
to your show and you may have sold.
Ted said that story.

615
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:55,521
Probably have people drive cars on it.
They go places that don't realize what 

616
00:28:55,561 --> 00:29:00,561
they're doing to get places.
It's like the serpent and the rainbow 

617
00:29:00,561 --> 00:29:00,561
man.
You become zombified and you're like,

618
00:29:00,561 --> 00:29:02,430
I'm not your bill pullman and a fucking 
casket.

619
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,450
Well,
there was a.

620
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,480
There was a guy that got pulled over a 
few years back who was famous and I 

621
00:29:08,521 --> 00:29:10,110
forget what he said,
something about like,

622
00:29:10,111 --> 00:29:12,180
I got to get to the dance or something 
like that,

623
00:29:12,181 --> 00:29:14,460
and the cops were like,
what the fuck you talking about?

624
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,360
And they realized like he was kind of 
out of it and then after it was over,

625
00:29:18,361 --> 00:29:21,660
it was revealed that he had been on 
Ambien and that he had gotten in his car

626
00:29:21,661 --> 00:29:24,440
and really had no idea.
He didn't even know he was traveling.

627
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,580
I'm over like literally the guy was in a
dream.

628
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:30,390
It reminds me of when I was a kid,
this was not drug related,

629
00:29:30,391 --> 00:29:31,590
but I was a kid.
I was asleep.

630
00:29:31,591 --> 00:29:34,290
I fell asleep on the couch watching TV 
and before my,

631
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:39,310
like my brother had lost his fucking 
wallet at a school dance and my mother 

632
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:43,311
was like,
I'll drive you up there and try to find 

633
00:29:43,311 --> 00:29:43,311
it.
And my father would get up for work

634
00:29:43,311 --> 00:29:44,950
at about 9:00
at night and then had to work at 10:00

635
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:46,780
and I think he started working at 11:00
at night.

636
00:29:46,781 --> 00:29:49,030
He worked at the post office cancel and 
fucking stamps.

637
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,370
Um,
so he,

638
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,070
I,
my,

639
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:57,140
my mom tells me that and I fall asleep 
on the couch watching like fucking 

640
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,871
dynasty or some shit.
It was the eighties and then my dad 

641
00:30:00,871 --> 00:30:01,540
wakes me up because he woke up and 
nobody was home.

642
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:04,540
Like my mom wasn't around,
nobody was there and he's like,

643
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,660
where is everybody?
And he fucking startled me awake.

644
00:30:07,661 --> 00:30:08,500
So I was like,
what?

645
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,480
Oh,
Donald Donald,

646
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:15,510
they had to go to the school because 
Donald lost his thriller and my father 

647
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:15,510
goes,
what?

648
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,380
And I was like,
Donald last is thriller.

649
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,180
And he was like,
I don't know what you're saying.

650
00:30:19,181 --> 00:30:24,181
And I was like,
dot mom said that Donald losses 

651
00:30:24,181 --> 00:30:26,910
thriller.
And I kept replacing the word wallet 

652
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:27,850
with fucking thriller.
And my father looked at me and literally

653
00:30:27,851 --> 00:30:31,180
sent these out the next day to be like,
are you using drugs?

654
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,050
And I was like,
no,

655
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,050
you woke me up.
I guess it was in some sort of,

656
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:37,990
maybe I was dreaming about fucking 
thriller was 1982,

657
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,940
you know,
like eight brain just never clicked back

658
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:44,941
over into waking life.
Stayed in this weird Zombie land where 

659
00:30:44,941 --> 00:30:44,941
we're wallet meant thriller.

660
00:30:44,941 --> 00:30:46,990
Did you find that,
you know,

661
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:52,950
what we were looking at got pulled over 
and I'm trying to remember what he told 

662
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:53,030
the cops where they realized that 
something was going on.

663
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:58,420
I think it was,
it was in one of the articles that I 

664
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:58,420
tweeted the store was in one of the 
articles that I tweeted.

665
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,920
Um,
what happens in that instance?

666
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:05,930
You get in trouble.
Can they rescue for being the ambient 

667
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:09,551
driver?
It's a rare reaction because a lot of 

668
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:11,690
people take that shit right here.
This story all the time.

669
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:15,710
There's not selling just a couple of 
those pills a day,

670
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:21,180
a webpage devoted to stories of people 
who took ambien and got fired for being 

671
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:21,620
racist.
He's right.

672
00:31:21,621 --> 00:31:22,640
Well,
even better,

673
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:26,660
there's no stories of people that took 
Ambien and,

674
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,830
uh,
you know,

675
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,720
became addicted to it and became some 
sort of a.

676
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,650
or is there,
is that addictive?

677
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,760
Is Ambient addicted?

678
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:36,900
Yeah,
probably.

679
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,560
Probably.
Yeah.

680
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,800
I think they like getting addicted to 
falling asleep and here needing it to 

681
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:42,800
fall asleep probably.
Yeah.

682
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,260
Yeah.
I guess if you're somebody who like,

683
00:31:43,261 --> 00:31:44,550
I can't go sleep with that,
that.

684
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,200
Yeah.
Wonder if it's addictive.

685
00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:48,450
Like maybe like a heroin is addictive.
No.

686
00:31:48,451 --> 00:31:49,800
Right.
Or like a speed,

687
00:31:49,801 --> 00:31:51,570
you know,
like people get like physically addicted

688
00:31:51,571 --> 00:31:54,360
to things where it kind of changes the 
receptors.

689
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:55,650
Yeah.

690
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,240
Yeah.
Pr.

691
00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:00,050
I don't know if it dulls the senses to 
the point where like when you.

692
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:05,051
I mean that's the way I heroin's always 
explained to me was when you're on 

693
00:32:05,661 --> 00:32:07,880
heroin,
the senses are dulled.

694
00:32:07,881 --> 00:32:11,330
The nerve receptors like just don't take
in as much,

695
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,530
but when you're not on heroin,
that pain of withdrawal,

696
00:32:15,531 --> 00:32:20,531
part of it is the receptors coming back 
to life all at once and it was a light 

697
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,170
skinned.
Yeah.

698
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,690
Jason,
Jason Muse.

699
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,250
Long time ago I had problems with that 
shit.

700
00:32:25,251 --> 00:32:28,820
So it was one of the Rehab doctors 
communicated it thusly.

701
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:33,821
He said,
you know how when you sit on your hand 

702
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:33,821
and fucking falls asleep?
I'm like,

703
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:33,821
yeah,
totally.

704
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:38,441
He's like,
imagine that was your whole body and 

705
00:32:38,441 --> 00:32:38,441
times it by a million.
That's what he's going through.

706
00:32:38,441 --> 00:32:38,441
Wow.
That was like,

707
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:39,020
oh,
and then.

708
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,980
Yeah,
because up until then I

709
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,800
was always like,
just fucking stop doing heroin.

710
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,110
Just stop it.
And then meanwhile I was eating a lot of

711
00:32:45,111 --> 00:32:46,590
sugar.
Just stop doing your job.

712
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,200
You might fucking drug.
But once that dude explained it that 

713
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,200
way,
I was like,

714
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,220
oh,
that would be.

715
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:57,790
That would be fucking painful.
No wonder the kid doesn't want to get 

716
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:00,971
off heroin because he's like,
I know the path to not being on heroin 

717
00:33:00,971 --> 00:33:04,280
is full of pins and needles,
but you never die from it.

718
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:09,340
That's the good thing about that.
Like you don't die from heroin 

719
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,831
withdrawal.
We know from amy winehouse and other 

720
00:33:11,831 --> 00:33:14,930
cases that you can die from alcohol 
withdrawal like you can.

721
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,960
You can get off.
Like when you're in jail and you're 

722
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,690
kicking heroin,
you know the cops just be like,

723
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,300
you know the hair just keep throwing up 
and piss in,

724
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:26,720
but if you're kicking booze,
they have to give you booze because your

725
00:33:26,721 --> 00:33:27,350
heart could stop.

726
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,880
What are we looking at?
This fucking article,

727
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:33,881
he pulled up an estimated 446,000
people in the United States were current

728
00:33:34,671 --> 00:33:39,671
hmis users of Ambien.
Now what is the misuse and dependency 

729
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,310
onto ambien can develop after just two 
weeks of use.

730
00:33:43,311 --> 00:33:48,311
Don't attempt to quit without proper 
knowledge and before putting a medical 

731
00:33:48,311 --> 00:33:50,300
treatment plan into place.
Wow.

732
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:55,450
Two weeks is all it takes.
Two weeks [inaudible] son maybe driving 

733
00:33:56,361 --> 00:33:59,450
around having conversations because it 
uses Ambien,

734
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:03,890
gets a good night's sleep and you know 
the worst that happens on the job in the

735
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:04,470
morning.
You,

736
00:34:04,471 --> 00:34:07,460
you kinda where you're like,
you just lose a word like your leg.

737
00:34:07,461 --> 00:34:12,461
Donald last is thriller and that's the 
lowest mildest form of every now and 

738
00:34:12,461 --> 00:34:13,880
then you skip a word,
which I do now.

739
00:34:13,881 --> 00:34:17,360
I call that hitting a pothole.
Roseanne is,

740
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:22,450
she's an older lady,
she's in her sixties and she's had some 

741
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:26,060
mental problems and uh,
and she's drinking and she's taking that

742
00:34:26,061 --> 00:34:30,680
stuff to go to sleep and she's not 
taking it for just two weeks.

743
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,480
She's taking it a lot,
you know.

744
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,410
And she said she needs it to go to sleep
and I think there's a lot of people that

745
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,100
feel like they need something to help 
them go to sleep that fine.

746
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,210
But then tweet ticket fucking works.
Yeah.

747
00:34:41,211 --> 00:34:46,211
I don't think at the end of the day it's
not like she took ambien and that makes 

748
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:46,211
her bad.
Like,

749
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:49,840
no,
it's that she fucking tweeted what you 

750
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,451
did.
And it's like if you think for a second 

751
00:34:52,451 --> 00:34:55,900
that if in using this drug,
which I need to go to sleep because I'm 

752
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,450
late sixties woman and any of my rest or
whatever,

753
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,030
I'm at war.
You just deserve fucking sleep.

754
00:34:59,031 --> 00:35:00,680
Like you know,
I've merciful,

755
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,300
I've never suffered from a lack of 
sleep,

756
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:05,030
but I know that people who have,
and it's fucking mind bending itself,

757
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,330
but if you know you have to do that and 
you know,

758
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:13,660
there's the slightest chance that you 
could become somebody else or say things

759
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:17,510
that are not in your character,
give up your fucking social media man.

760
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:21,950
Like I don't think she realized that she
was obviously going to do that.

761
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:27,070
I think she had tweeted ridiculous shit 
in the past before and had flew under 

762
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:27,290
the radar and nobody cared.
Right.

763
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,030
But it's,
it's a racism thing,

764
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,640
you know,
and what's,

765
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:34,860
what's fascinating to me about it and 
what's positive to me about it is that 

766
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:39,040
we have.
Our culture has like a fucking zero for 

767
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,040
racism

768
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,130
now.
It things have tightened up so much.

769
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:46,850
Like it's entirely possible that within 
a few decades like racism can be almost 

770
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,560
completely eradicated.
I think it's possible with the spread of

771
00:35:52,561 --> 00:35:55,200
the Internet,
we're going into like 50 years from now,

772
00:35:55,201 --> 00:36:00,201
60 years from now,
racism could be seen as the ridiculous 

773
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:04,290
idea that it is.
Racism can be seen the way someone looks

774
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:05,460
at it or someone like Jane,

775
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:09,020
there'll be like a roddenberry world,
there'll be like star trek people.

776
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,310
Like maybe back in the day there was 
something like that,

777
00:36:11,311 --> 00:36:13,080
but we haven't experienced that in 
centuries.

778
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,200
Yeah.
The distrust in and hate for specific 

779
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:23,060
gigantic general groups of people like 
Asians or blacks or whatever and the 

780
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:28,730
disparaging ideas that you have about a 
race just because they're,

781
00:36:29,301 --> 00:36:34,301
you know,
just because a person's from a specific 

782
00:36:34,301 --> 00:36:34,301
part of the world,
that shit,

783
00:36:34,301 --> 00:36:34,680
it's got to be a thing of the past.
We got to get past that

784
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:40,010
because I would love to believe that,
but unfortunately we live in a bubble 

785
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:40,020
out here.
Where do you live?

786
00:36:40,021 --> 00:36:43,230
In a bubble.
It does kind of work in it.

787
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,520
You know,
at Dm.

788
00:36:44,521 --> 00:36:49,521
That's unbelievable.
I've heard people out there about to 

789
00:36:49,521 --> 00:36:49,830
like,
judge the fact that he's fucking sell in

790
00:36:49,831 --> 00:36:51,570
California.
California blows the one.

791
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,670
I'm not saying like,
Yay California,

792
00:36:53,671 --> 00:36:55,560
fuck the rest of the world of fuck the 
rest of the country.

793
00:36:55,561 --> 00:37:00,561
But I will say this,
everyone here lives fairly 

794
00:37:00,561 --> 00:37:01,770
multiculturally and there doesn't seem 
to be.

795
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,620
I mean,
granted we're in this area of the state.

796
00:37:04,621 --> 00:37:08,190
Perhaps it's different elsewhere,
but it feels.

797
00:37:08,191 --> 00:37:13,191
I'm not gonna say Utopian,
but it feels like people get along out 

798
00:37:13,191 --> 00:37:13,230
here.
Even if it's a plastic,

799
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:16,260
get along.
It's still get along pretty good.

800
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:21,350
Yeah.
So much so that I think a lot of people 

801
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:21,350
in the state where that's,
you know,

802
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,910
we're mystified when the election went 
the way it did because they were like,

803
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:24,270
what?

804
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,330
No,
because that's not the way life works.

805
00:37:27,331 --> 00:37:32,331
Well,
it's not the way life works in most of 

806
00:37:32,331 --> 00:37:32,550
California,
but I think that's the way it went for a

807
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:33,810
bunch of reasons.
You know,

808
00:37:33,811 --> 00:37:36,120
a lot of the middle of the country 
didn't feel represented.

809
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,520
A significant say when it comes to,
um,

810
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:42,790
you know,
the um,

811
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,870
what's it called?
Electoral College vote.

812
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:51,200
That's when we get squirrely.
When you look at the points that 

813
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,390
different states are worth,
like,

814
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,010
it's very weird that we still have that.
It's not a person,

815
00:37:56,011 --> 00:37:57,000
one person,
one vote,

816
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,350
not even one person,
one vote.

817
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:02,850
It's like these weird fucking spots.
Why isn't it one person,

818
00:38:02,851 --> 00:38:03,450
one vote,
like,

819
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:07,500
is this explained to me in high school 
why the Electoral College was necessary?

820
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:09,480
And even then I was like,
yeah,

821
00:38:09,481 --> 00:38:11,460
but well,
one person,

822
00:38:11,461 --> 00:38:13,680
one vote kind of makes more sense.
No,

823
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:17,570
both you and I know Jack Shit about 
politics makes this,

824
00:38:17,571 --> 00:38:22,571
uh,
this journey of where people are 

825
00:38:22,571 --> 00:38:22,860
bleeding from their ears going fucking 
idiots,

826
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,660
but the checks and balances that are in 
play,

827
00:38:24,661 --> 00:38:29,661
like the representative government is 
what keeps someone from just like 

828
00:38:29,661 --> 00:38:31,140
running through the whole thing and we 
get a little bit of a test to it by like

829
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:31,530
trump.

830
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,770
I met a buddy of yours on a plane.
What guy?

831
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,320
Oh yeah.
My favorite area.

832
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,630
Yeah.
Nice guy.

833
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:42,930
But here's what I want to pass on.
Like we were on a 45 minute flight,

834
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:48,630
maybe super smooth like in and not in 
the way of like,

835
00:38:49,571 --> 00:38:51,190
hello,
I'm Lando Calrissian.

836
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:56,640
But this dude had a thing like a,
like a rep parts and not like he wasn't 

837
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,910
like having sex with somebody but he had
a,

838
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:04,500
a rep our tag going with the flight 
attendant that was so effortless and you

839
00:39:05,171 --> 00:39:10,171
know,
I sit next to him and we chit chatted 

840
00:39:10,171 --> 00:39:10,171
before the flight and I had mentioned 
something about fucking Joe Rogan.

841
00:39:10,171 --> 00:39:10,540
He goes,
I've,

842
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,150
I know Joe Rogan and he talks about like
content,

843
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:13,540
blah,
blah blah.

844
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:16,660
But in any event,
for the rest of the flight,

845
00:39:16,661 --> 00:39:21,661
I had to like a front row seat for him 
talking to the flight attendant and it 

846
00:39:21,661 --> 00:39:24,580
was like,
it was a real clinic in like,

847
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:28,980
oh,
like he's got that thing that like I,

848
00:39:28,981 --> 00:39:32,110
I've had to make up for not having my 
whole life.

849
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:37,130
But people,
well not even just talking to people 

850
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:40,351
like,
like the way like you watched like a 

851
00:39:40,351 --> 00:39:40,660
fucking movie star,
say two things.

852
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:42,970
And the people like,
oh you,

853
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:48,020
you like he just had this person in the 
palm of his hand and I'm being very 

854
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:52,891
careful because I don't want it to seem 
like he was making the moves on her and 

855
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:52,891
he,
he wasn't,

856
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:57,510
but he easily could have been with that 
person by the flights end.

857
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:03,390
And it was just as I sat there watching 
it going like I've had to make up for a 

858
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,150
deficit in my whole life.
Being like,

859
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,800
here,
here's some funny things.

860
00:40:05,801 --> 00:40:10,801
And Hey,
I saw star wars and talk about all this 

861
00:40:10,801 --> 00:40:10,801
other shit to try to trick somebody into
fucking me.

862
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,380
This guy just like sits down on the 
plane,

863
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,260
was like,
what's up,

864
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,190
and she was like,
oh,

865
00:40:15,191 --> 00:40:20,191
you and instantly started going,
talking to them and I was trying to 

866
00:40:20,191 --> 00:40:20,191
discern throughout the whole flight.

867
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,140
Did they know each other as he see her 
on this flight often or something?

868
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:28,590
No Dry.
He hit that flight as dry as anybody 

869
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:32,101
else and literally could have walked 
away hand in hand with somebody who's 

870
00:40:32,101 --> 00:40:32,590
very impressive.
He's got bowhunter confidence.

871
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,300
Is that what it is?
That's what it is.

872
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,010
It's got to be.
It's the same thing.

873
00:40:36,011 --> 00:40:37,690
You exist.
Not even a regular bow hunter.

874
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:42,700
He's like a super advanced bowhunter 
where a compound bow was too easy for 

875
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:42,700
him.
He said that,

876
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,960
well,
he switched over to a recurve bow,

877
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,500
will cs to get closer to animals and 
practice more.

878
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,510
He was explaining my friend Aaron 
Snyder,

879
00:40:49,511 --> 00:40:54,511
he's a little bit crazy without even.
He was explaining that and it didn't 

880
00:40:54,511 --> 00:40:55,390
sound braggy,
like a really good podcast.

881
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,030
He said he's cast.
What's it called?

882
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,790
Kfar.
[inaudible] K I f a r U.

883
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:05,791
it's a.
it's a company that he works for that 

884
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:08,221
makes really high end hunting and hiking
backpacks and military backpacks and uh,

885
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:11,950
he does a podcast through them and he 
said he's very good at it.

886
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,170
He's very good at talking.
He's a funny dude.

887
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:19,200
I couldn't fucking attest to it.
I sat there and watched him be 100 

888
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:19,650
confidence.
Is that what it is?

889
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,440
I think so,
yeah.

890
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:22,300
He's not a swagger.
It's whole life.

891
00:41:22,301 --> 00:41:24,640
Like there was nothing about him that 
instantly.

892
00:41:24,641 --> 00:41:29,641
I mean it was definitely very macho,
but there was nothing about his thing 

893
00:41:29,641 --> 00:41:31,210
that was like,
I am a guy's guy.

894
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,980
It wasn't even that,
like honestly flight attendant probably

895
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,010
could have been a guy in a barren was 
just as interested in short,

896
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,230
short range bow hunting.
He would've landed that guy as well.

897
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,340
Like he was very,
I don't know,

898
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:44,420
it was good.
Like when he said I do a podcast too,

899
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:45,350
it made sense.
I was like,

900
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:46,770
I bet you do.
Yeah,

901
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,590
smart dude.
And so that's a weird way to live.

902
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:56,630
You know,
it spends 200 nights a year in the 

903
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,400
forest,
sleeping in like either a bivy sack or a

904
00:41:58,401 --> 00:42:00,890
tent or under a tarp,
like fucking,

905
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,920
just like Robin Hood.
He's out there all the time and it's 

906
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,461
like there's not a whole lot of people 
that are doing that more woods than men.

907
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:12,200
That's another guy was ex military too.
It's a lot of these ex military guys.

908
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:17,230
They get really in a bow hunting because
they find it very difficult in a 

909
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:17,960
physical challenge.

910
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:21,020
It's nerve wracking and it's hard to 
keep your cool under pressure.

911
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:25,700
And for a lot of guys who um,
they go from the military and maybe do a

912
00:42:25,701 --> 00:42:30,701
few tours overseas and come back to the 
mainland and just have a real issue with

913
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:36,100
being just not stimulated enough and you
feel detached and you don't feel like 

914
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:40,550
you're involved in anything that's got 
like a high adrenaline threshold.

915
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,180
And for a lot of these guys,
bowhunting is very therapeutic.

916
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:49,450
The.
So is that an issue when people come 

917
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:49,450
back?
Uh,

918
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:50,030
the,
the issue I always hear about,

919
00:42:50,031 --> 00:42:52,850
of course there's ptsd,
but that sounds like the opposite.

920
00:42:52,851 --> 00:42:57,851
Like somebody who's like,
I was there for the rush and now the 

921
00:42:57,851 --> 00:42:59,510
real world offers like that's that her 
not even necessarily that there were,

922
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:01,580
yeah,
that hurt like hurt rock locker.

923
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,980
Not even necessarily that they're there 
for the rush,

924
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:06,860
but that once they experience that rush,
you know,

925
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:12,360
got to bring this book up too much,
but Sebastian younger wrote a book 

926
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,881
called tribe and it's all about this and
it's about these guys coming back from 

927
00:43:15,881 --> 00:43:20,471
war and trying to just sort of assemble 
it and having a really difficult time 

928
00:43:20,661 --> 00:43:23,780
and how so many of them talk about when 
they were over there,

929
00:43:23,781 --> 00:43:28,730
they had a purpose and that life was 
intensified and cranked up to 10 and the

930
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,920
highs were the highest and the lows were
the lowest.

931
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,620
They come back here and everything's 
just too flat.

932
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:38,980
It's just really hard for them to adjust
and they feel disconnected from their 

933
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:42,191
community and they laid long to go back 
and that's why a lot of them keep 

934
00:43:42,191 --> 00:43:46,301
signing up and going back and they feel 
that that life at the tip of the spear 

935
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,580
is actually more,
more satisfying,

936
00:43:49,581 --> 00:43:54,581
more rewarding.
It just feels right for them and the 

937
00:43:54,581 --> 00:43:55,790
regular world just for whatever reason,
they've just tasted it or they've.

938
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,640
They've adjusted to it,
but there they have a very,

939
00:43:58,641 --> 00:44:00,170
very difficult time.
Some of them do.

940
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:03,530
Was the closest you've ever felt to 
that,

941
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:09,160
like have you ever gotten close to the 
feeling of like what have you done in 

942
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,190
life that has given you the adrenaline 
high?

943
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,140
What's your highest adrenaline rush?
I guess I'm asking the probably the most

944
00:44:15,141 --> 00:44:20,141
nervous I ever got was when I was 
fighting when I was doing martial arts 

945
00:44:20,141 --> 00:44:20,930
because there was a nervous for a good 
reason.

946
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:26,140
It's like you might get fucked up.
It's really possible you might get 

947
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,721
kicked in the head,
but I'm the second most nervous was 

948
00:44:28,721 --> 00:44:30,860
before I did stand up for the first time
I was shitting my pants man.

949
00:44:30,861 --> 00:44:34,620
It was fucking nervous.
I don't know.

950
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:36,540
I don't know.
I'm funny.

951
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:39,690
Like were you high school funny?
I was locker room funny.

952
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:44,990
I was A.
I would make my friends laugh in the 

953
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:46,650
locker room.
I got talked to by a good buddy of mine,

954
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:48,720
my friend Steve Graham.
I'm still good friends with.

955
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:50,940
He talked me into it,
him and my friend Ed shorter,

956
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,320
they just,
they talked me into it.

957
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,220
I would make them laugh,
you know,

958
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,480
and,
but I thought that they were laughing 

959
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,581
because they were my friends and I felt 
like everybody else gonna think I'm an 

960
00:45:01,581 --> 00:45:01,581
asshole.
Like they're just being polite.

961
00:45:01,581 --> 00:45:02,750
Well it's all that too.

962
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:06,570
And like my sense of humor was fucked up
because it was all fighters,

963
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,670
you know?
And so everybody was like,

964
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:13,940
they were hard men.
So you had to have like a certain 

965
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:14,250
staying to your gallows.
Humor.

966
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:17,250
Well everybody was on their way to go 
kick people in the head.

967
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,990
It was just a weird life,
you know?

968
00:45:19,991 --> 00:45:22,680
It was very,
very strange way to be 15.

969
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,720
You now have 15,
16,

970
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:26,660
17.
That was like my whole life to.

971
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:31,440
That wasn't the adrenaline rush.
The adrenaline rush of doing standup was

972
00:45:31,441 --> 00:45:36,441
unexpected.
That's why I freaked me out because I 

973
00:45:36,441 --> 00:45:36,441
didn't think I was going to be so 
nervous and I was shitting my pants.

974
00:45:36,441 --> 00:45:41,121
I just didn't have a background in 
performing and right before I was going 

975
00:45:41,121 --> 00:45:41,121
up there I was thinking all the times 
that I,

976
00:45:41,121 --> 00:45:43,380
I fought and I should be comfortable 
doing this,

977
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,250
but I was fucking shit in my pants.
I was so terrible.

978
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:49,740
Oh,
so I was so terrified.

979
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:51,660
It was in Boston,
a place called stitches.

980
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,500
Are they still there?
August 27.

981
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:54,400
Nineteen 88?
No,

982
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:54,900
no,
no,

983
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:55,930
no.
The day.

984
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:56,770
Yeah,
for sure.

985
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,180
You're making me cry.
That's awesome.

986
00:45:58,181 --> 00:45:59,560
Why do you remember that?
I don't know.

987
00:45:59,561 --> 00:46:01,000
I always remembered it.
Say it again.

988
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:04,720
August 27,
1988 because then naturally everything I

989
00:46:04,721 --> 00:46:07,210
hear I have to put through a filter of 
how does this affect me?

990
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,190
So I'm sitting there going,
what was I doing?

991
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,840
August 27th,
1988.

992
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,590
I had just graduated high school in 
June.

993
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:20,430
And where was I working?
I was working at buyright liquors and 

994
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:20,650
shit like that.
Um,

995
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:26,070
and it would be two years before I would
go onto the stage at rascals in town 

996
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:31,780
between the monmouth mall in the CV 
square mall and try it myself.

997
00:46:31,781 --> 00:46:34,310
And I didn't not tell West orange.
No,

998
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,260
that's,
that's up north.

999
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:40,290
Ours is down in like a by Asbury Park.
This place was like a couple miles from 

1000
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:40,660
asbury park south.

1001
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:42,110
Yeah,
I did that one too.

1002
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:44,860
Yeah,
as a pro.

1003
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:49,870
I went in an open mic night just because
I didn't tell my fucking friends because

1004
00:46:49,871 --> 00:46:52,990
I was terrified my friends and be like,
why do you think you're funny and stuff.

1005
00:46:52,991 --> 00:46:56,080
I was not the funniest of my friends.
So I wasn't sitting there going like,

1006
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:57,940
yeah man,
come support me.

1007
00:46:57,941 --> 00:47:01,620
I kind of did it on the slide and stuff 
and I did five minutes.

1008
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:06,650
I made like one joke that really worked 
a bit about sucking my dick and that 

1009
00:47:07,361 --> 00:47:11,260
wound up in clerks.
It was tested in front of the audience.

1010
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:16,261
So I was like,
well I know that might get a laugh and 

1011
00:47:16,261 --> 00:47:16,261
stuff.
So what was,

1012
00:47:16,261 --> 00:47:16,261
how long was your first beat?
Was it open?

1013
00:47:16,261 --> 00:47:17,320
MIC is open mic?
Yeah,

1014
00:47:17,321 --> 00:47:21,370
I think they gave you five minutes and I
don't think I even had five minutes.

1015
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:23,530
I think I had four.
What'd you do observe?

1016
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,400
No,
I just,

1017
00:47:24,401 --> 00:47:26,920
I,
I just told some terrible jokes.

1018
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,870
Terrible.
Just literally set up.

1019
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:29,860
Yeah,
yeah,

1020
00:47:29,861 --> 00:47:30,310
yeah,

1021
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:31,570
yeah.
They were awful.

1022
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,180
The stuff that I've written,
you know,

1023
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:38,230
just weird.
I haven had a piece of paper that I 

1024
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,020
brought with me on stage because I was 
terrified I was going to forget a lot of

1025
00:47:41,021 --> 00:47:46,021
guys.
He knew you were a pro and you can put 

1026
00:47:46,021 --> 00:47:46,021
that paper away.
I'm about to cry.

1027
00:47:46,021 --> 00:47:47,020
That's so fucking sweet,
man.

1028
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,640
A young you.
How old are you at this point?

1029
00:47:48,641 --> 00:47:53,641
It was 21.
So why'd you wait so long after I have 

1030
00:47:53,641 --> 00:47:56,440
to be 21 to get a little boost to go 
into a nightclub,

1031
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:57,640
you know,
that's what I thought.

1032
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:59,600
Apparently I was wrong though.
And you,

1033
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,600
they would allow you as a performer to 
go in.

1034
00:48:01,601 --> 00:48:04,090
They're younger,
but I didn't know this at the time.

1035
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,670
I thought you had to be 21.
So I waited until I was 21,

1036
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:09,730
which was August 11th and then I went up
August 27th.

1037
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:12,280
What was the,
what got the biggest laugh?

1038
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,080
Who knows?
You know,

1039
00:48:14,081 --> 00:48:16,270
the fucking day.
I can't remember.

1040
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:21,390
The material was terrible.
I tried to think past it as quickly as 

1041
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:21,790
possible.
The one joke that I remember,

1042
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:27,230
this is my impression of a good looking 
girl getting pulled over by a cop like 

1043
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:27,230
drilling fast.
We're going,

1044
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:29,170
no,
do you like my tits?

1045
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,000
So I do.
Here's a warning.

1046
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,500
Like it was that bad.
That's how bad.

1047
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:36,100
That's how bad the comedy I was 
slinging.

1048
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:41,560
Take you home man and put you on a show.
That's an adorable joke.

1049
00:48:41,561 --> 00:48:43,070
Ladies and gentlemen.
Wait a second.

1050
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,680
How many years before news radio is 
that?

1051
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:50,310
I'm 88 was six years.
So technically if one follows the 

1052
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:54,661
journey backwards,
that fucking terrible joke lands you 

1053
00:48:54,661 --> 00:48:55,870
eventually on Newsradio.
Yeah.

1054
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,590
In a way.
Get you this building.

1055
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:03,170
Yeah.
In a way that's not mock that joke 

1056
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:03,170
anymore.
That was a good strong.

1057
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:04,540
Well that's the weird wings of a 
butterfly that becomes a hurricane.

1058
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:09,541
Right?
Like go back in your life and think 

1059
00:49:09,541 --> 00:49:09,541
about weird little lefts you took or 
right.

1060
00:49:09,541 --> 00:49:12,850
You took a bunch of those when I had 
three months ago at heart.

1061
00:49:12,851 --> 00:49:12,970
Yeah.

1062
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,920
Tech,
when I was on the table,

1063
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:17,780
because of the good doctor was just 
like,

1064
00:49:17,781 --> 00:49:18,390
uh,
you,

1065
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,620
uh,
you have a 100 percent occlusion in your

1066
00:49:21,621 --> 00:49:23,030
lad.
And I was like,

1067
00:49:23,031 --> 00:49:25,060
I don't know what that means.
He says,

1068
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:26,170
your lad is your,
uh,

1069
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,430
is the main artery that goes across the 
front of your heart.

1070
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:31,190
He's going,
it's a 100 percent occlusion,

1071
00:49:31,191 --> 00:49:34,790
means 100 percent blocked.
You've got cholesterol is blocked,

1072
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:39,820
there's no way for blood to get through.
And that's what's creating your mass 

1073
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:39,820
part of tech.
So he's like,

1074
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:39,820
we're gonna,
we're gonna.

1075
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,030
Take care of it right now.
He goes,

1076
00:49:41,031 --> 00:49:42,590
but you're accomplished guy,
right?

1077
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:43,310
I said,
yeah.

1078
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:44,720
And he goes,
you'll like this,

1079
00:49:44,721 --> 00:49:46,820
that artery.
That's called the widow maker.

1080
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:47,870
And I said,
why?

1081
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:53,170
And he goes,
because 80 percent of cases of 100 

1082
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:53,210
percent occlusion,
the patient always dies.

1083
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,100
He's gone,
but you're going to be in the 20 percent

1084
00:49:55,101 --> 00:49:56,240
because I'm really good at my job.

1085
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,920
And he fucking disappeared into my 
crotch.

1086
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:01,880
One of my grind through my femoral 
artery and fucking went up into my heart

1087
00:50:01,881 --> 00:50:04,730
and put a stent in that,
in that lad.

1088
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:06,560
And the moment he opened up,
he goes,

1089
00:50:06,561 --> 00:50:08,360
I'm gonna open it up now.
And he showed me what it was,

1090
00:50:08,361 --> 00:50:10,310
tiny little mesh wire thing.
He goes,

1091
00:50:10,311 --> 00:50:12,470
I'm gonna open it froome.
Suddenly it was like,

1092
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:18,320
because that artery had been like a hose
of the it and it's fucking full of water

1093
00:50:18,321 --> 00:50:19,850
and shit and was pushing down on the 
heart,

1094
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:21,530
which was in turn pushing down on my 
lungs.

1095
00:50:21,531 --> 00:50:23,000
I had no idea it was having a heart 
attack.

1096
00:50:23,001 --> 00:50:24,680
I just felt like I couldn't catch my 
breath.

1097
00:50:24,681 --> 00:50:29,681
I thought I was too hot.
And it was in between shows between two 

1098
00:50:29,681 --> 00:50:31,040
gigs when you were filming?
We shot them both while we were going to

1099
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:31,340
shoot them.

1100
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:36,340
Both my only shot the one because I had 
the heart attack and we didn't do the 

1101
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:36,340
second one,
but it was for,

1102
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:40,181
uh,
for the folks that commented dynamics 

1103
00:50:40,181 --> 00:50:42,371
and it became a showtime special.
So we were shooting two shows that 

1104
00:50:42,371 --> 00:50:46,001
night.
It was meant to be like an hour and an 

1105
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:46,001
hour.
But you know,

1106
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:46,001
once you get up there I feel like I'm 
fucking rolling.

1107
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:50,471
I'm rolling.
So I did two hours and after the first 

1108
00:50:50,471 --> 00:50:53,381
show they were like,
we don't even need to do the second 

1109
00:50:53,381 --> 00:50:53,381
show,
we can cut an that we're only cutting an

1110
00:50:53,381 --> 00:50:53,630
hour out of it.
So you gave us plenty and stuff.

1111
00:50:53,631 --> 00:50:58,631
I said I got two different hours so I 
want to do the second show and plus 

1112
00:50:58,631 --> 00:51:02,231
everyone was there.
They were lined up and so I took a big 

1113
00:51:02,231 --> 00:51:03,740
swig of fucking milk.
I was dairy drinker,

1114
00:51:03,741 --> 00:51:05,360
heavy dairy drinker in those days.

1115
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,860
I've since become Vegan ice,
be happy now.

1116
00:51:07,861 --> 00:51:09,560
I'm fucking Vegan.
But uh,

1117
00:51:09,561 --> 00:51:14,561
I took a big swig of milk then I went to
the green room and I chitchatted real 

1118
00:51:14,561 --> 00:51:16,940
quick with Jordan,
who runs our company as Jason's wife,

1119
00:51:16,941 --> 00:51:17,880
Jason Muses,
wife.

1120
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:19,670
And uh,
emily was there.

1121
00:51:19,671 --> 00:51:22,490
She does my hair and makeup.
So we're Chit Chat.

1122
00:51:22,491 --> 00:51:23,120
And then I was like,
man,

1123
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:24,620
I feel fucking weird.
I feel sick.

1124
00:51:24,621 --> 00:51:26,420
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
Can you guys get Outta here?

1125
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:31,430
Because when I get sick I just want to 
go off like an animal and fucking die 

1126
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:34,541
alone.
Like I don't want to be ministered to 

1127
00:51:34,541 --> 00:51:34,541
him.
Like fuck off and shit.

1128
00:51:34,541 --> 00:51:34,541
So they were like,
yeah,

1129
00:51:34,541 --> 00:51:39,131
totally.
And I laid down on the floor and I felt 

1130
00:51:39,131 --> 00:51:41,950
like nauseous,
nauseated and I never feel sick like 

1131
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:45,011
that and wound up throwing up some bile,
nothing chunky but just like fluid and 

1132
00:51:45,011 --> 00:51:46,310
so I was like,
well maybe I'll feel better now.

1133
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,980
Stood up and I looked in the mirror and 
I was just swamp man.

1134
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:52,610
Like now as a heavy dude,
you sweat when you fucking breathe.

1135
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:57,670
This was like I'd look like I'd just 
come out of the pool and I felt really 

1136
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:57,710
cold.
I couldn't get warm and ship.

1137
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,650
Emily popped her head and she's like,
are you okay?

1138
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:01,540
I was like,
no man,

1139
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:03,920
can you turn on like a hairdryer?
And just like drop me off.

1140
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:08,921
I feel fucking freezing cold.
And she touched back of my neck while 

1141
00:52:08,921 --> 00:52:08,921
she's driving me.
She's like,

1142
00:52:08,921 --> 00:52:09,920
you never feel like this.
This is scary.

1143
00:52:09,921 --> 00:52:10,750
You should do something.
I said,

1144
00:52:10,751 --> 00:52:11,300
hey,
yeah.

1145
00:52:11,301 --> 00:52:16,301
I said I was still wanting to do that 
second show as like someone to find a 

1146
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:16,520
couch.
Just a cast for me to lay down.

1147
00:52:16,521 --> 00:52:21,521
If I get like a half hour nap,
I'm sure I'll be fucking fine and I 

1148
00:52:21,521 --> 00:52:24,260
couldn't get comfortable on the couch,
couldn't sleep and that's when I started

1149
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:26,480
not being able to catch my fucking 
breath.

1150
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:32,140
So you know,
I'm no doctor but like fucking you 

1151
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:32,140
think,
you know,

1152
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:35,111
I know my body and I know what this is.
I smoke too much weed and I've got too 

1153
00:52:35,111 --> 00:52:36,410
much mucus in my fucking chest.
That's all this is.

1154
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:41,360
So I said I better sit up and put my 
arms up like this because that will help

1155
00:52:41,361 --> 00:52:46,361
me breathe.
And Jordan comes around the corner 

1156
00:52:46,361 --> 00:52:46,940
eventually and she sees me.
She's like,

1157
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:47,750
you're right.
And I was like,

1158
00:52:47,751 --> 00:52:49,970
you know,
having a hard time catching my breath.

1159
00:52:49,971 --> 00:52:54,971
I could breathe.
I just can't get all the way to the top 

1160
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:54,971
and stuff of the breath.
Can't take a full fucking breath.

1161
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:56,600
I was like,
maybe I,

1162
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:59,270
maybe we shouldn't do that second show 
after all.

1163
00:52:59,271 --> 00:53:00,770
And she goes,
we already canceled it.

1164
00:53:00,771 --> 00:53:05,771
And I was like,
why the fuck did you cancel the second 

1165
00:53:05,771 --> 00:53:05,771
show?
And she was like,

1166
00:53:05,771 --> 00:53:05,771
because I'd never seen you sick like 
this.

1167
00:53:05,771 --> 00:53:06,680
She's gone,
you know this,

1168
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:07,940
this is weird.
Something's going on.

1169
00:53:07,941 --> 00:53:08,270
I said,
yeah,

1170
00:53:08,271 --> 00:53:10,790
maybe I should see a doctor.
And she goes to Sunday night,

1171
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:12,650
all doctors are closed.
So we called an ambulance.

1172
00:53:12,651 --> 00:53:14,480
I was like,
why the fuck did you call an ambulance?

1173
00:53:14,481 --> 00:53:15,290
Oh my God,
this is,

1174
00:53:15,291 --> 00:53:16,610
don't,
this is embarrassing.

1175
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:17,540
She's like,
they're already here.

1176
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:22,810
And six fireman came into the room.
Big Brawny fucking do is when you call 

1177
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:24,080
paramedics,
fire department comes as well.

1178
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:25,620
So,
uh,

1179
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:28,260
they're looking at me because I'm 
sitting in the chair with my arms up and

1180
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:28,830
like,
there are,

1181
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:31,170
some of them were young,
four of them are young and it looked,

1182
00:53:31,171 --> 00:53:36,171
they looked at me like,
why is silent Bob celebrating a fucking 

1183
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:36,171
touchdown,
you know,

1184
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:39,621
and shit.
Like all of a sudden the medics came in 

1185
00:53:39,621 --> 00:53:39,621
and they,
uh,

1186
00:53:39,621 --> 00:53:41,050
there was a guy and a girl and the guy 
puts a cuff on me.

1187
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:41,950
He goes,
how you doing man?

1188
00:53:41,951 --> 00:53:43,770
As a good,
I can't really catch my breath.

1189
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:45,390
And uh,
he goes,

1190
00:53:45,391 --> 00:53:46,050
well,
we're gonna.

1191
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,370
Look at you right now.
Put the cuff on you.

1192
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:49,400
You ever had this done?
I said,

1193
00:53:49,401 --> 00:53:50,370
Oh yeah,
I know how to do this.

1194
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:54,960
And then the girl had a uh,
like look like a fishing tackle box at a

1195
00:53:54,961 --> 00:53:56,850
bunch of leads,
wires coming out of it and shit,

1196
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,770
she put that down as heart monitor 
thing,

1197
00:53:58,771 --> 00:54:00,750
you know,
they get your fucking blood pressure,

1198
00:54:00,751 --> 00:54:05,751
all that shit on one arm.
Then the other thing they put on your 

1199
00:54:05,751 --> 00:54:06,060
chest to monitor what's going on inside.
So she's like,

1200
00:54:06,061 --> 00:54:07,470
I get to put these wires on you.
I said,

1201
00:54:07,471 --> 00:54:09,860
okay,
and I'm sitting in the chair and this is

1202
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:14,870
40 pounds ago and sitting is no good 
angle for fucking fat guy to begin with 

1203
00:54:15,181 --> 00:54:15,930
and shit like that.

1204
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:20,930
So she just yanks my fucking hockey 
shirt and undershirt up and every tiddy 

1205
00:54:21,481 --> 00:54:25,570
I have falls out of my fucking shirt in 
front of these people and there's a room

1206
00:54:25,571 --> 00:54:27,770
full of people and I'm like,
Oh fuck and shit.

1207
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:29,190
I yanked my shit down.
She's like,

1208
00:54:29,191 --> 00:54:30,060
what are you doing?
I was like,

1209
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,480
man,
that's my fucking best friend's wife 

1210
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:35,480
over there.
She never seen my fucking tits.

1211
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,090
My wife's never seen much.
It's like,

1212
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,860
again,
you don't Yank my shirt up like that.

1213
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:38,250
She goes,
Hey,

1214
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:39,240
get these wires on.
And I said,

1215
00:54:39,241 --> 00:54:44,241
well,
all the shared out you reach up under 

1216
00:54:44,241 --> 00:54:44,241
and put them on my chest.
He goes,

1217
00:54:44,241 --> 00:54:44,730
how am I supposed to say?
And I was like,

1218
00:54:44,731 --> 00:54:47,660
do you use my nipples as God posts?
Like it was,

1219
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:50,040
you know,
I've spent all of my life trying to hide

1220
00:54:50,041 --> 00:54:53,310
my fucking fat and when your life is in 
danger,

1221
00:54:53,311 --> 00:54:54,540
I've never been in that situation.

1222
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:59,540
But when your life is in danger,
nobody gives a fuck about your fucking 

1223
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:00,150
ego and shit.
Like their vanity.

1224
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:03,750
So they looked at their info and they 
realize I guess what was going on?

1225
00:55:03,751 --> 00:55:08,751
They were like,
we're going to take you to the hospital 

1226
00:55:08,751 --> 00:55:08,751
just to be safe.
And I was like,

1227
00:55:08,751 --> 00:55:08,751
don't do that,
that's fucking embarrassing and shit.

1228
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:09,660
And they were like,
Nah,

1229
00:55:09,661 --> 00:55:10,770
we're so close,
man.

1230
00:55:10,771 --> 00:55:12,270
It'll be fun.
You ever been to the hospital?

1231
00:55:12,271 --> 00:55:12,810
I was like,
no,

1232
00:55:12,811 --> 00:55:13,910
not really.
Like,

1233
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,300
Oh fuck,
it's fun.

1234
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:15,910
He goes,
you're gonna.

1235
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:16,650
Have a good time.
I was like,

1236
00:55:16,651 --> 00:55:17,670
all right,
and you know,

1237
00:55:17,671 --> 00:55:18,960
I'm a podcaster,
so I'm like,

1238
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,460
look,
at the end of the day,

1239
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:22,920
no time is wasted.
Everything's a fucking story.

1240
00:55:22,921 --> 00:55:27,921
So if this turns into the opening five 
minutes of Hollywood Babylon where I'm 

1241
00:55:27,921 --> 00:55:30,921
like,
they took me to the hospital and it 

1242
00:55:30,921 --> 00:55:30,921
turned out it was just too fucking high.

1243
00:55:30,921 --> 00:55:34,160
Like,
life's great when your podcasts or 

1244
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,671
[inaudible],
there's no such thing as fucking bad 

1245
00:55:36,671 --> 00:55:36,671
news anymore.
Like it hit.

1246
00:55:36,671 --> 00:55:38,100
It can hit you on the level of like,
Oh shit,

1247
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:43,101
that's unfortunate,
but right away you repurpose it into 

1248
00:55:43,101 --> 00:55:43,101
like,
all right,

1249
00:55:43,101 --> 00:55:46,251
well I've got something to talk about 
and this latest setback is just the 

1250
00:55:46,251 --> 00:55:49,360
longest is just a momentary chapter in 
the long story or fucking telling.

1251
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:52,260
So I was happy to go to the hospital,
not because I was like,

1252
00:55:52,261 --> 00:55:54,720
I think I'm dying,
but because I was like,

1253
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:55,580
all right,
fuck it.

1254
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:57,450
I'll have a story to tell after this 
next week.

1255
00:55:57,451 --> 00:55:59,760
It will be fun.
I got to the hospital,

1256
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,090
like Dr Layden Jaime,
he's the guy who's now my cardiologist.

1257
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:04,770
They pulled me into the er and he's 
like,

1258
00:56:04,771 --> 00:56:05,490
hi,
how are you?

1259
00:56:05,491 --> 00:56:06,480
I'm Dr Leighton,
and I said,

1260
00:56:06,481 --> 00:56:07,130
hey man,
how are you?

1261
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:07,920
He goes,
what's wrong?

1262
00:56:07,921 --> 00:56:08,470
What's going on?

1263
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,930
I said,
I can't catch my breath,

1264
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,090
and he goes,
well,

1265
00:56:12,091 --> 00:56:13,800
that's because you're having a massive 
heart attack.

1266
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,980
It was the first time anyone had said 
anything like that.

1267
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:19,440
How did he know for sure?
That's what he does.

1268
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:24,530
I think what he knew for sure was when 
they put the leads on me and the blood 

1269
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:26,560
pressure,
they looked at each other at one point,

1270
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:29,320
but I assumed like numbers that'll show 
up.

1271
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:34,330
That'll indicate that something just 
happened and they made this wonderful 

1272
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:34,330
call.
I got to find these kids,

1273
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:36,250
give them a hug one day on the call 
sheet,

1274
00:56:36,251 --> 00:56:37,940
because we were shooting that night on 
the call sheet.

1275
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:42,990
It was a different hospital,
but they took me to Glendale adventist 

1276
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:48,060
because they knew that I was in having a
cardiac episode and that's shy of one 

1277
00:56:49,271 --> 00:56:51,470
hospital in New York.
Glendale,

1278
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:56,020
Dale adventist is one of the best 
cardiology wings in the United States of

1279
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:56,020
America.

1280
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:58,960
So I happen to be in the right place at 
the right time.

1281
00:56:58,961 --> 00:57:03,961
We were supposed to shoot my comedy 
special at the Ryman Auditorium in 

1282
00:57:03,961 --> 00:57:03,961
Nashville.
Um,

1283
00:57:03,961 --> 00:57:08,110
it wound up being shot instead at the 
Alex in Glendale and stuff.

1284
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:10,870
And if I hadn't been doing the show 
there,

1285
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:12,280
who fucking knows,
man,

1286
00:57:12,281 --> 00:57:17,281
I might have gone to a hospital,
but I probably might've fucking died 

1287
00:57:17,281 --> 00:57:20,760
because homeboy told me when he went up 
the heart when I was in the operating 

1288
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,000
room and he told me like,
they call that the widow maker and shit,

1289
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:25,430
80 percent 80 slash 20.
I sat there going like,

1290
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,790
these are the weirdest odds I've ever 
had in my life.

1291
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:30,370
I figured like you leave the house,
it's 50 slash 50,

1292
00:57:30,371 --> 00:57:31,990
you're going to fucking drop dead,
right?

1293
00:57:31,991 --> 00:57:35,020
They get hit by a car struck by 
lightning trip of fucking dog.

1294
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:38,020
And then the dog bite your juggler and 
you fucking bleed out your look.

1295
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:40,300
But I always loved dogs and you die 
ironically.

1296
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:41,520
But uh,
you know,

1297
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,940
just dragging along.
But the 80 slash 20 million,

1298
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:46,570
20 percent chance of life was fucked up,
fucked up thought.

1299
00:57:46,571 --> 00:57:48,730
First time I'd ever had that kind of 
thought.

1300
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:52,120
And in my head I had to cognitively 
reframe it and go,

1301
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:55,630
you don't know,
you might've been close to death so many

1302
00:57:55,631 --> 00:58:00,631
fucking times in your life.
There might've been like a cycle behind 

1303
00:58:00,631 --> 00:58:03,721
you with a fucking knife and then all of
a sudden you got a cell phone call and 

1304
00:58:03,721 --> 00:58:06,420
forgot about you or something like that.
So suddenly I repurposed it the whole 

1305
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:10,500
time I was laying on the table.
I get re purposing every not repurposed 

1306
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,730
and cognitively reframing.
I was sitting because I couldn't like at

1307
00:58:12,731 --> 00:58:14,530
one point they were like,
your wife's on the phone.

1308
00:58:14,531 --> 00:58:16,120
Do you want to say you want to talk to 
her?

1309
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,760
After they told me that I was having a 
heart attack and that they had to get up

1310
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:22,480
and be fast and stuff.
So they are holding up a phone and I see

1311
00:58:22,481 --> 00:58:24,820
it as the first time a crystallized 
where I was like,

1312
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,700
oh these,
these people think I'm going to die.

1313
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,700
Like I didn't.
I was in no pain whatsoever.

1314
00:58:30,701 --> 00:58:33,130
I couldn't catch my breath.
They kept asking me like zero to 10.

1315
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:34,930
How do you feel?
What's your pain level?

1316
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:35,830
I was like,
negative three.

1317
00:58:35,831 --> 00:58:37,000
They're like,
you're doing this wrong.

1318
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:42,300
I didn't feel pain.
It wasn't like I grew up in the 

1319
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:42,790
seventies watching Sanford and sons and 
my idea of a heart attack is.

1320
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,940
That's big and shit.
Felt none of the symptoms.

1321
00:58:45,941 --> 00:58:48,070
No numbness in the arm.
Anything like that.

1322
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:51,050
I was sweating a,
I threw up bile.

1323
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:52,520
Bile.
Um,

1324
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:55,120
I was cold.
And,

1325
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:56,560
and what was the last one?

1326
00:58:56,590 --> 00:59:01,590
It was just fucking shit.
You would never associate with a heart 

1327
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:01,590
attack.
Like he would associate it with like,

1328
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:01,600
oh,
I just,

1329
00:59:01,601 --> 00:59:06,601
I feel under the weather.
But apparently these are symptoms of 

1330
00:59:06,601 --> 00:59:09,901
heart attacks as well.
I like to share it because some cats 

1331
00:59:09,901 --> 00:59:13,051
never heard that before.
And I've seen a lot of people on social 

1332
00:59:13,051 --> 00:59:13,051
media since we were like,
you saved my life.

1333
00:59:13,051 --> 00:59:17,671
Here's why.
Because I talked about the fucking 

1334
00:59:17,671 --> 00:59:19,410
symptoms and shit.
So while I'm laying there and they go 

1335
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:19,410
up,
you're growing,

1336
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:21,320
they go up your femoral artery to your 
heart.

1337
00:59:21,321 --> 00:59:26,321
And stuff.
He went up and he saw that it was all 

1338
00:59:26,321 --> 00:59:26,321
blocked.
He said later on,

1339
00:59:26,321 --> 00:59:26,750
I was just like,
fuck man.

1340
00:59:26,751 --> 00:59:28,850
Like I like dropped 80 pounds three 
years ago.

1341
00:59:28,851 --> 00:59:32,030
I've been like walking up a hill a mile 
and a half every day and stuff.

1342
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:32,900
He goes,
yeah,

1343
00:59:32,901 --> 00:59:34,400
but the kind of blockage you had.

1344
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,220
You guys that didn't start fucking 
recently.

1345
00:59:37,221 --> 00:59:39,290
He's gotten that started in childhood 
now.

1346
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:39,860
I was like,
man,

1347
00:59:39,861 --> 00:59:42,650
fucking hostess twinkies.
And then I remembered we had no money.

1348
00:59:42,651 --> 00:59:43,460
So I was like,
man,

1349
00:59:43,461 --> 00:59:45,230
fucking little debbie Swiss delights and
shit.

1350
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,230
That's how it happened.
It started with little debbie cakes.

1351
00:59:48,231 --> 00:59:50,000
I'm with you because I was raised on him
and shit,

1352
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:55,180
but you know,
we were trained to like twinkies more 

1353
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:57,191
because they had a commercial little 
debbie would never bother with the 

1354
00:59:57,191 --> 00:59:57,191
commercial.
Then didn't have a commercial that did.

1355
00:59:57,191 --> 00:59:59,030
They know you can't.
Well the leaders later they did,

1356
00:59:59,031 --> 01:00:04,031
but when we were kids they didn't 
because how can you have a commercial 

1357
01:00:04,031 --> 01:00:05,260
and sell your product for fifty nine 
cents oyster cake?

1358
01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:08,810
Just like a better experience because 
they had more of those trans fats.

1359
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:13,010
Trans fats back then.
I think so.

1360
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:16,100
Colin's fats probably.
Well,

1361
01:00:16,101 --> 01:00:18,590
think about it.
Trans fats are part of a.

1362
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:24,130
When you eat,
like what were those cookies that were 

1363
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:25,810
not peak screens?
Um,

1364
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:30,010
is like a white Oreo.
Goddammit.

1365
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:32,930
I forget the name of it.
It was fairly well known,

1366
01:00:32,931 --> 01:00:35,810
but when I was a kid it was an older 
brand from child,

1367
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:40,860
some of my parents' childhood and Hydrox
hydrox their name hydrox comes from 

1368
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:48,850
hydrogen ised a palm oil or corn oil.
And so that's when it began.

1369
01:00:51,201 --> 01:00:51,650
They were like,
Hey,

1370
01:00:51,651 --> 01:00:56,651
we can take this and fuck it up and turn
it into something edible and shit like 

1371
01:00:56,651 --> 01:00:56,660
that.
Not knowing you that block arteries,

1372
01:00:57,410 --> 01:01:00,760
but canola oil,
like all that kind of nonsense stuff.

1373
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:03,880
But I went after a heart attack.
I want to fucking get there.

1374
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:05,150
It is hydraulic.
Yeah,

1375
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:10,151
it's crazy.
It's named after a chemical that could 

1376
01:01:10,151 --> 01:01:10,151
fucking kill you.

1377
01:01:10,151 --> 01:01:10,970
And that's how they marketed it back in 
the day.

1378
01:01:10,990 --> 01:01:12,890
Kids Chemicals.
Dude.

1379
01:01:12,891 --> 01:01:15,110
I used to fuck up some pepperidge farm 
cookies.

1380
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,320
Remember those pepperidge farms talking 
to a fat man.

1381
01:01:18,321 --> 01:01:21,080
I've eaten every cookie cookie there is 
man with milk.

1382
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:25,970
Do you remember when they marketed the 
almost almost home cookies,

1383
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:31,180
almost home cookies.
So essentially there was a craze and 

1384
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:34,160
still they still exist to some degree,
but when we were children,

1385
01:01:34,161 --> 01:01:37,130
cookies were hard unless they came out 
of an oven fresh.

1386
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,130
Then they started serving these soft 
bake cookies.

1387
01:01:40,131 --> 01:01:45,131
You can get them there.
They are almost tell them now I remain 

1388
01:01:45,131 --> 01:01:45,860
your grocers island shit.
And so you'd take this cookie out of the

1389
01:01:45,861 --> 01:01:49,610
package and bite it.
And it was soft as if it came out of the

1390
01:01:49,611 --> 01:01:54,611
oven.
And that too is a chemical process I 

1391
01:01:54,611 --> 01:01:56,180
believe because things are meant to get 
hard after they come home.

1392
01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:58,460
And it didn't.
Exactly,

1393
01:01:58,461 --> 01:02:00,150
man.
It's like watching porn hard,

1394
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:05,200
fast.
You're eating some much that doesn't 

1395
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:05,200
turn into mold.
I uh,

1396
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,070
I went vegan post heart attack but I'm 
certainly,

1397
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:11,300
it's not an ethical thing like my kids 
vegan because she's like,

1398
01:02:11,301 --> 01:02:14,150
I love animals,
but I went vegan because they were like,

1399
01:02:14,151 --> 01:02:19,151
you know,
if you go plant based you've got a 

1400
01:02:19,151 --> 01:02:19,151
really great chance of dropping your 
cholesterol.

1401
01:02:19,151 --> 01:02:22,080
And my kid had been bugging me to go 
Vegan for like three years and stuff and

1402
01:02:22,081 --> 01:02:23,340
not,
but honestly not bugging me.

1403
01:02:23,341 --> 01:02:24,820
She would just make comments every once 
in a while,

1404
01:02:24,821 --> 01:02:26,130
like not your mom,
not your milk.

1405
01:02:26,131 --> 01:02:31,131
Whenever I was drinking milk.
And so after the heart attack 

1406
01:02:31,131 --> 01:02:34,911
nutritionist was in the hospital room 
with mango and like 100 percent 

1407
01:02:34,911 --> 01:02:34,911
blockage,
man.

1408
01:02:34,911 --> 01:02:36,080
He definitely time to change your diet 
as a gay.

1409
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:38,160
Right.
And Are you eating before?

1410
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:41,730
I just fucking,
I'm not even like a lot of weight.

1411
01:02:41,731 --> 01:02:43,280
And when you lost lot of weight,
I remember you would do.

1412
01:02:43,281 --> 01:02:44,910
Doing a lot of juicing.
Yeah,

1413
01:02:44,911 --> 01:02:49,911
I was doing a bit of that.
Which vegetable juices I've since told 

1414
01:02:49,911 --> 01:02:53,691
me is not good because you're supposed 
to distribute the juice of whatever with

1415
01:02:56,011 --> 01:02:59,130
the fiber while eating the fruit and 
stuff.

1416
01:02:59,131 --> 01:03:01,680
This juicing thing is,
it depends on what juice,

1417
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:03,960
vegetable juice.
It's not really an issue,

1418
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:06,280
but um,
but yeah,

1419
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:11,290
like it,
like I'm part of now I'm a weight 

1420
01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:13,041
watchers ambassador and people that um,
believe that like they,

1421
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:16,200
they like vegetable juices,
they say that you really better off with

1422
01:03:16,201 --> 01:03:21,201
like a vegetable smoothie,
like when you get the fiber it is all 

1423
01:03:21,201 --> 01:03:21,300
about the smoothie and keep some of the 
fiber in it.

1424
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:26,380
And the weight watchers diet,
you go by points and shit like that or 

1425
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:29,400
some shit like you can if you eat a 
banana,

1426
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:34,640
no points if you juice a banana or 
blended banana than it has points 

1427
01:03:35,641 --> 01:03:37,620
because then it's no longer about the 
fiber.

1428
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:40,230
It's all about the sugar at that.
Babies don't have any points anymore,

1429
01:03:40,231 --> 01:03:40,860
Huh?
No,

1430
01:03:40,861 --> 01:03:44,730
they took points away from like eggs,
Turkey and chicken,

1431
01:03:44,731 --> 01:03:46,920
which broke my heart because I used to 
love Turkey chicken.

1432
01:03:46,921 --> 01:03:51,090
Then I realized I didn't love Turkey and
chicken as much as I thought like I went

1433
01:03:51,091 --> 01:03:55,030
on in order to after the heart attack,
um,

1434
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:00,440
I read a while.
I listened to it on tape and not even a 

1435
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,520
tape digitally.
A Penn Jillette's book.

1436
01:04:02,521 --> 01:04:07,521
Presto about how he lost 100 pounds 
after his heart episode and it's a 

1437
01:04:07,521 --> 01:04:09,450
fantastic book.
I'm sure you had a similar issue,

1438
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,370
like a heart attack,
but he didn't have a heart attack.

1439
01:04:11,371 --> 01:04:16,371
They were like,
you're on the fucking birds and they 

1440
01:04:16,371 --> 01:04:17,931
were going to give them a bunch of 
bypasses and then a friend of his was 

1441
01:04:17,931 --> 01:04:17,931
like,
instead of that,

1442
01:04:17,931 --> 01:04:19,530
why don't you just try eating radically 
different.

1443
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:21,840
I could propose a way for you.
Ray Cronies,

1444
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:26,460
he as a diet called just sides and so in
pens book Presto,

1445
01:04:26,461 --> 01:04:29,280
he details out.
Ray was like for the first two weeks,

1446
01:04:29,281 --> 01:04:31,020
just eat potatoes.
Nothing but potatoes.

1447
01:04:31,021 --> 01:04:33,420
You have as many as you want.
He as many fucking potatoes as you want,

1448
01:04:33,421 --> 01:04:38,421
but you can't put anything on him.
You can't fry them is just bake the 

1449
01:04:38,421 --> 01:04:39,150
potato and eat it.
Eat everything.

1450
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:44,180
And you can have nine if you're in a 
certain but you can't put any butter on 

1451
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:44,180
them.
No Salt,

1452
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:44,640
nothing.
Just flat up potatoes.

1453
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:50,240
So for me that sounded tired.
Well I just come off the heart attack so

1454
01:04:51,781 --> 01:04:53,310
I'm like,
I'd rather not die,

1455
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:57,510
so I'll fucking try one potato two weeks
straight up.

1456
01:04:57,511 --> 01:05:00,420
Just potatoes and raw.
Not Raw,

1457
01:05:00,421 --> 01:05:05,421
like uncooked.
You can bake them but you can't use 

1458
01:05:05,421 --> 01:05:07,761
anything to cook and you can't wrap it 
in tin foil with butter and salt or 

1459
01:05:07,761 --> 01:05:07,761
anything like that.

1460
01:05:07,761 --> 01:05:09,660
Just flat out playing the victim and 
then you must have been bored as fuck.

1461
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:12,810
That's what happens to trigger the Diet,
at least in my estimation,

1462
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:14,730
is that um,
you,

1463
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:20,720
you're allowed to eat as many potatoes 
you want and you think you like 

1464
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,461
potatoes.
When I was reading pens book or rather 

1465
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:23,461
listening to pence book,
I was like,

1466
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:23,461
oh my God,
I can do that.

1467
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:28,410
Like I fucking dig potatoes and then you
realize you don't like potatoes as much 

1468
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:31,831
as you like butter and salt and milk and
everything that goes into like mashed 

1469
01:05:31,831 --> 01:05:33,550
potatoes and stuff.
So it's,

1470
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:37,960
in the beginning there's a sense of 
satiety because potatoes have some girth

1471
01:05:37,961 --> 01:05:39,880
to him and stuff,
but they're mostly water.

1472
01:05:39,881 --> 01:05:44,881
So it's an excellent diuretics or 
pissing like a racehorse and that's 

1473
01:05:44,881 --> 01:05:47,680
dropping weight like more water out of 
your bottom good vitamins in the skin as

1474
01:05:47,681 --> 01:05:48,040
well.

1475
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,110
A lot of potassium.
But some people,

1476
01:05:50,111 --> 01:05:51,390
like when I was telling him,
you know,

1477
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,020
the moment you tell people what you're 
doing,

1478
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:58,050
you know,
everyone's got their fucking advice 

1479
01:05:58,050 --> 01:05:59,671
about how to dye it and shit.
And when I was talking about I'm doing 

1480
01:05:59,671 --> 01:05:59,671
this potato diet,
people can't eat potatoes,

1481
01:05:59,671 --> 01:05:59,800
carbs,
man.

1482
01:05:59,810 --> 01:06:01,960
Don't fucking nuts too much.
It's bad and shit.

1483
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:04,360
But in two weeks of eating nothing but 
potatoes,

1484
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:06,880
I lost 19 pounds,
just like 19 pounds.

1485
01:06:06,881 --> 01:06:08,800
Just dropped off a lot of water.
Weight.

1486
01:06:08,801 --> 01:06:13,801
Absolutely.
But at the same time it taught me 

1487
01:06:13,801 --> 01:06:13,801
something more important than like,
fuck,

1488
01:06:13,801 --> 01:06:16,450
I hate potatoes.
It taught me to fast.

1489
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:19,180
Like it taught me to like now I eat a 
meal a day.

1490
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:21,040
I don't eat in the morning when I get 
up.

1491
01:06:21,041 --> 01:06:24,190
I don't listen to the propaganda of like
you got eight of breakfast and shit like

1492
01:06:24,191 --> 01:06:24,460
that.

1493
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:27,490
Not at all.
My Body has enough stored energy.

1494
01:06:27,491 --> 01:06:32,491
I don't need to fucking eat eggs and 
orange juice in order to fucking feel 

1495
01:06:32,491 --> 01:06:35,910
good in the morning.
I just have to wait for my body to be 

1496
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:35,910
like,
nothing's coming in great.

1497
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:37,210
We'll hook over to the fucking stored 
energy and shit like that.

1498
01:06:37,211 --> 01:06:39,550
And I got a lot of like intermittent 
fasting.

1499
01:06:39,551 --> 01:06:41,740
So what are you doing?
It's not so much intermittent.

1500
01:06:41,741 --> 01:06:46,620
It's like I eat once a day and then some
days if I'm like feeling needy,

1501
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:48,620
like you go through it,
you hit a wall every once in a while.

1502
01:06:48,621 --> 01:06:50,980
Like generally about 9:00,
8:39.

1503
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:55,810
I get a first Pang of hunger and my 
instincts are like fucking quick fix it.

1504
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:59,740
And then I remember like just in 10 
minutes it's going to pass.

1505
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,330
And then 10 minutes.
Absolutely.

1506
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:02,980
Talking about nine in the morning.
Yeah.

1507
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:04,250
So,
um,

1508
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:08,200
you're eating one meal,
typically dinner generally about 3:00

1509
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:11,560
in the afternoon and then you go a long 
time before you eat again.

1510
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:13,720
Dude,
that's the way to eat man.

1511
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:15,700
A lot of people think that's the way to 
eat it.

1512
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:18,610
I think so.
Smarter people than I like gray.

1513
01:07:18,611 --> 01:07:23,611
Who created the just sides?
Diet and penn who followed the Diet and 

1514
01:07:23,611 --> 01:07:23,611
stuff.
Same thing.

1515
01:07:23,611 --> 01:07:25,470
One meal a day.
Pen.

1516
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:27,800
I can't.
I'm trying to.

1517
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:30,730
I don't think he's down to one meal a 
day.

1518
01:07:30,731 --> 01:07:35,731
I think he just eats better than I do.
Like he was able to keep up with res 

1519
01:07:35,731 --> 01:07:35,731
died.
I couldn't.

1520
01:07:35,731 --> 01:07:37,870
After the two weeks it was like,
okay,

1521
01:07:37,871 --> 01:07:40,630
now we corn and I was like,
I've never eaten corn in my life.

1522
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,090
Wait a minute.
He's telling you just eat corn?

1523
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:48,120
No.
He was saying to add corn to the Diet 

1524
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:48,120
and they were adding more things after 
the first two weeks.

1525
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:48,820
It wasn't like potatoes.
Now just corn.

1526
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:54,170
This just sides.
That's his hook is that you're eating 

1527
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:54,170
the size essentially or eating 
everything.

1528
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:57,400
That's kind of just all plant based and 
stuff and so I couldn't.

1529
01:07:57,580 --> 01:08:01,420
I was hoping that I could fucking go the
distance and be a vegetable.

1530
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:06,600
I fucking hate vegetables and so I had 
to figure out a way to be v eight 

1531
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:11,580
vegetated so much.
How could you be a Vegan and hate 

1532
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:14,371
vegetables?
You find a very thin corridor in which 

1533
01:08:14,371 --> 01:08:18,560
you know to live and exist scooping up 
that tow food pretty much eating pinto 

1534
01:08:19,911 --> 01:08:21,650
beans,
eating black beans,

1535
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,430
good source of carbohydrates,
right?

1536
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:24,890
What else?
You know,

1537
01:08:24,891 --> 01:08:28,450
what I've fallen in love with and never 
ate before in my life or chickpeas.

1538
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:31,250
Chickpeas are great.
Such a great goto snack,

1539
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:35,630
fucking full of protein.
And in Vegan comfort food cooking.

1540
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:39,170
They use it as a versatile ingredient.

1541
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:42,560
So like if you go to one of my favorite 
restaurants in town is crossroads.

1542
01:08:42,561 --> 01:08:43,850
They've got like this,
uh,

1543
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:46,400
they got real big place,
right?

1544
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:48,560
Is that the,
believe it is.

1545
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:50,480
I believe Travis Barker,
the drummer,

1546
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:52,910
he,
that's his place.

1547
01:08:52,911 --> 01:08:57,911
I believe so.
I'm pretty sure they got a meatball sub 

1548
01:08:57,911 --> 01:08:57,911
there,
dude.

1549
01:08:57,911 --> 01:08:58,220
I would.
I'd suck a dick for it.

1550
01:08:58,221 --> 01:09:00,980
So fucking good.
Immersively that don't make you do that.

1551
01:09:00,981 --> 01:09:02,780
They just make you pay.
That's very sweet of them.

1552
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:04,280
It's good.
Is good business model.

1553
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:07,560
It's supposed to be a very good place.
It is one of the fantastic.

1554
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:12,590
There's meatball subs,
Travis Travis's place tastes exactly 

1555
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:14,060
like five miles from here.
Maybe a little bit more called.

1556
01:09:14,061 --> 01:09:15,860
Follow your heart.
Have you ever been in that place?

1557
01:09:15,890 --> 01:09:16,670
Yes,
I have.

1558
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:21,060
That's why I met Ray to talk about the 
Diet first.

1559
01:09:21,150 --> 01:09:23,030
Some killer fucking pancakes,
man.

1560
01:09:23,031 --> 01:09:23,900
I don't know what they're dealing with.

1561
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:26,420
Kind of Voodoo they're doing to make a 
vegan pancake.

1562
01:09:26,421 --> 01:09:27,920
Takes that good.
In New York,

1563
01:09:27,921 --> 01:09:30,050
they got a place in Brooklyn called 
Champ's diner,

1564
01:09:30,051 --> 01:09:32,900
which is also like all plant based Vegan
food,

1565
01:09:32,901 --> 01:09:37,901
but they do comfort food like you know 
like you can get a like an impossible 

1566
01:09:37,901 --> 01:09:42,041
burger or beyond that or like you're 
eating meat balls and you think about 

1567
01:09:42,041 --> 01:09:42,041
it,
you're like,

1568
01:09:42,041 --> 01:09:42,820
all right,
the bread is most of it.

1569
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:48,340
The sauces,
the next biggest part and meat balls 

1570
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:48,610
themselves aren't really that packed 
with me.

1571
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:50,690
It's much more breading than fucking 
meat and stuff.

1572
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:53,730
So I have to do is find something 
that'll stand in for the fucking meet,

1573
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:59,080
drench it in fucking Marinara sauce and 
put it in between a nice soft roll and 

1574
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,750
they use like ricotta,
like a cashew ricotta,

1575
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,820
like kind of finished it off.
It is fucking bliss dude.

1576
01:10:04,821 --> 01:10:05,960
Now you know,
it's just like,

1577
01:10:05,961 --> 01:10:08,360
it's Vegan comfort food,
so you can't do that every day.

1578
01:10:08,530 --> 01:10:13,530
Right.
But it's nice to know that if you're 

1579
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:13,530
ever,
like,

1580
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:14,720
I've missed real fucking food,
I want to eat a goddamn animal,

1581
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,750
they can hand you something that's close
to the approximate.

1582
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:20,180
Now the good news,
because I know a lot of people like fuck

1583
01:10:20,181 --> 01:10:23,090
veganism and you're absolutely right.
It's no damn fun for me at least.

1584
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:27,150
But after a month of plant based,
uh,

1585
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:32,160
I was on a series of medications after 
the heart attack and stolen and it was 

1586
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:35,861
on a full dose of Lipitor,
which is a cholesterol fucking cutter 

1587
01:10:35,861 --> 01:10:36,800
and stuff like that.
So my doctor,

1588
01:10:36,801 --> 01:10:38,630
I was telling him about this potato diet
and he's like,

1589
01:10:38,631 --> 01:10:43,631
I don't trust this.
He's gone on to do so I want to do your 

1590
01:10:43,631 --> 01:10:43,631
meds,
give me some of your blood.

1591
01:10:43,631 --> 01:10:43,631
So he takes my,
he's like,

1592
01:10:43,631 --> 01:10:44,600
I gotta make sure you're getting all the
nutrition.

1593
01:10:44,601 --> 01:10:49,601
And he's like,
you can't get it all from a fucking 

1594
01:10:49,601 --> 01:10:49,601
potato.

1595
01:10:49,601 --> 01:10:51,400
I'm sorry.
So he did my labs and came back and he 

1596
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:51,400
was like,
you're fantastic.

1597
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,060
He's going nutrients wise.
You're great.

1598
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:58,120
Everything is crossed.
The board is great except for 

1599
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:58,120
cholesterol.
I was like,

1600
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:58,120
well,
I did just have a heart attack,

1601
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:58,120
and he goes,
no,

1602
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:58,910
your cholesterol is in the toilet.
He's gone,

1603
01:10:58,911 --> 01:11:00,860
so I need you to break your lipitor and 
half.

1604
01:11:00,861 --> 01:11:05,861
He's going,
you can't take that much liberatory 

1605
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:05,861
anymore.
So he's like,

1606
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:05,861
what have you done different?
I was like,

1607
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:10,001
I'm just eating fucking potatoes.
Cholesterol drops so radically that he 

1608
01:11:10,001 --> 01:11:10,001
was worried.
Yeah,

1609
01:11:10,001 --> 01:11:13,800
and enough to take me off of my half,
half my prescription when is.

1610
01:11:13,850 --> 01:11:17,130
See I don't understand enough about 
cholesterol levels.

1611
01:11:17,131 --> 01:11:20,040
This is what they told me recently that 
I found fascinating.

1612
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:21,720
I thought I was like,
this is liberatory.

1613
01:11:21,721 --> 01:11:23,100
It's gonna.
Eat up the cholesterol.

1614
01:11:23,101 --> 01:11:23,520
He goes,
no,

1615
01:11:23,521 --> 01:11:24,600
it's in your system forever.

1616
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:25,620
And I was like,
really?

1617
01:11:25,621 --> 01:11:26,130
And he goes,
yeah,

1618
01:11:26,131 --> 01:11:29,250
I can loosen it up and move it about,
but then we have to be careful.

1619
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,950
Make sure it's loose and soft and 
globule cholesterol.

1620
01:11:31,951 --> 01:11:36,951
It doesn't go into your fucking brain.
Jesus if hard pieces like you know,

1621
01:11:37,021 --> 01:11:40,860
I don't know if you ever put like 
fucking grid off your teeth after you've

1622
01:11:40,861 --> 01:11:42,870
eaten or something like that,
come back to the,

1623
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,570
you know,
that's plaque technically I guess,

1624
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:47,970
but that's kind of shit that's up in 
your veins,

1625
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:50,520
but in that shit gets hard.
It gets super hard.

1626
01:11:50,521 --> 01:11:55,521
Like the,
the cholesterol that was blocking up my 

1627
01:11:55,521 --> 01:11:58,071
lad,
my man had to drill through it to get 

1628
01:11:58,071 --> 01:11:58,830
the stent in there and you keep that 
cholesterol forever.

1629
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:03,860
Now I can't say that a hundred percent,
but that's the way it was communicated 

1630
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:06,891
to me because I thought I was like,
this magic drug will eat up the 

1631
01:12:06,891 --> 01:12:06,891
cholesterol.

1632
01:12:06,891 --> 01:12:06,891
He goes,
no,

1633
01:12:06,891 --> 01:12:10,191
we have to be very careful with the 
cholesterol because it moves throughout 

1634
01:12:10,191 --> 01:12:10,920
your system chief.
So I guess maybe eventually it moves out

1635
01:12:10,921 --> 01:12:13,260
of your system,
but if it's in your blood system,

1636
01:12:13,261 --> 01:12:18,261
right,
there's a chance that it goes up near 

1637
01:12:18,261 --> 01:12:20,271
your brain eventually.
So maybe that's what they're trying to 

1638
01:12:20,271 --> 01:12:22,641
keep all idiots talking about medical 
stuff that right now you can't be an 

1639
01:12:22,981 --> 01:12:27,981
expert on everything Joe.
Sometimes you have to take shots in the 

1640
01:12:27,981 --> 01:12:27,981
dark.
Yeah.

1641
01:12:27,981 --> 01:12:28,330
So,
um,

1642
01:12:28,450 --> 01:12:29,490
we know your audience,
you know,

1643
01:12:29,491 --> 01:12:31,080
the audience is sitting there right now 
going like,

1644
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:34,920
this irritates me if they're not going 
to speak truth and hard facts.

1645
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:37,110
Don't tell.
Understand science.

1646
01:12:37,111 --> 01:12:38,100
We don't,
we don't.

1647
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:40,710
That's why we went in to entertain them.
But when you are,

1648
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:45,760
um,
you're getting a full blood panel done 

1649
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:45,820
and all these different things.
They're checking all your.

1650
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:47,190
I've also become,
yeah,

1651
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:51,840
and I'd be the guy that does algae and 
algae,

1652
01:12:51,841 --> 01:12:56,040
but are pills that this a re turned me 
onto this doctor.

1653
01:12:56,041 --> 01:12:58,170
I bet you know his name,
but his name escapes me.

1654
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,410
Who formulated this?
Uh,

1655
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:03,630
these are the nutrients you need a 
guarantee.

1656
01:13:03,631 --> 01:13:05,670
You've probably talked to this guy.
His name escapes me,

1657
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,650
but ray was like,
get these supplements.

1658
01:13:07,651 --> 01:13:12,651
They'll cover everything is gone because
you're no longer immediate or anything 

1659
01:13:12,651 --> 01:13:13,140
you need that would come out and meet 
comes out of this.

1660
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:14,070
But,
you know,

1661
01:13:14,071 --> 01:13:15,870
it was kind of explained to me when I 
was like,

1662
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:16,650
ah,
I don't know,

1663
01:13:16,651 --> 01:13:18,450
like my kid was going,
you could do it,

1664
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:20,760
Kiddo.
Like we were raised differently.

1665
01:13:20,761 --> 01:13:22,560
Like I,
granted I didn't,

1666
01:13:22,561 --> 01:13:24,690
I wasn't raised with flaming neon,
I did eat steak,

1667
01:13:24,691 --> 01:13:26,940
I'm through most of my childhood,
but that's kind of a meat,

1668
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:31,970
like it's tough to separate from 
something that you've lived with for so 

1669
01:13:31,970 --> 01:13:31,970
fucking long.

1670
01:13:31,970 --> 01:13:33,180
And she was like,
you gave up cigarettes.

1671
01:13:33,181 --> 01:13:34,150
And I was like,
oh all right,

1672
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:34,980
you're right.
And stuff.

1673
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:40,430
So it's nice to be able to go to places 
where you can eat food that's not just 

1674
01:13:40,430 --> 01:13:43,590
like grass and roots and shit like that.
What did you eliminate?

1675
01:13:43,591 --> 01:13:45,800
This is what I'm going to concentrate on
because I,

1676
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,030
she's dairy,
all dairy,

1677
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:48,960
cheese,
milk.

1678
01:13:49,230 --> 01:13:51,840
I was drinking no bullshit.
A two gallons of milk a day.

1679
01:13:51,841 --> 01:13:56,841
So that might've been part of the reason
I wound up having a fucking heart 

1680
01:13:56,841 --> 01:13:56,841
attack.
So milk went away,

1681
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:59,070
cheese went away.
Um,

1682
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:01,650
animal food products one away.
So no burgers.

1683
01:14:01,651 --> 01:14:03,960
That wasn't a big burger guy,
but I did like burgers.

1684
01:14:03,961 --> 01:14:06,720
What about bread?
Pasta,

1685
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:07,680
Pasta.
Pasta.

1686
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:10,710
Pasta can be Vegan,
but I mean it shouldn't,

1687
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:12,330
you shouldn't overdo it,
right?

1688
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:13,780
Can't eat up.
Fucked on a bread and stuff.

1689
01:14:14,070 --> 01:14:15,110
You shouldn't know.

1690
01:14:15,230 --> 01:14:18,810
So shit just and honestly they prefer 
went away,

1691
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:21,190
like most doctors aren't like,
hey man,

1692
01:14:21,191 --> 01:14:22,900
eat all the bread you want,
but you know,

1693
01:14:22,901 --> 01:14:24,860
it's,
it's as part of weightwatchers,

1694
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:29,880
it's,
it has a value to it that you can eat 

1695
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:32,731
bread,
but it takes up like a quarter of the 

1696
01:14:32,731 --> 01:14:33,340
point you can go to weightwatchers as a 
Vegan.

1697
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:34,950
Was it tricky?
No.

1698
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:39,960
Interestingly enough,
weight watchers so fucking simple 

1699
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:39,960
because they,
the APP,

1700
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:42,280
it's all APP based now.
Like I was part of it when I was a kid,

1701
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:44,960
like at age 14 I was part of 
weightwatchers,

1702
01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:50,450
um,
and I was like the lone male in the 

1703
01:14:50,450 --> 01:14:52,321
group and stuff.
Now it's so technologically based that 

1704
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:53,410
if you're in a food store and you're 
like,

1705
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,420
oh,
I want those.

1706
01:14:55,421 --> 01:15:00,421
But I wonder how many points.
You just scan the Barcode and it tells 

1707
01:15:00,421 --> 01:15:04,741
you.
And so you can enter things like pinto 

1708
01:15:04,741 --> 01:15:04,741
beans,
boom.

1709
01:15:04,741 --> 01:15:05,910
It tells you there's zero points.
So anything you entered,

1710
01:15:05,911 --> 01:15:08,470
they generally have a value for even 
fast food chains.

1711
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:11,590
So it's,
it's shockingly easy to use.

1712
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:16,630
Take weightwatchers out of the equation.
Is Being Vegan difficult?

1713
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:21,660
Yes.
Like I watched my kid go through it 

1714
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:21,660
where I'm like,
you have no choices,

1715
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:23,500
you're really limited to the places you 
can go in life and go out to eat,

1716
01:15:24,130 --> 01:15:29,130
but if it's a choice between wine and up
in the fucking emergency room again and 

1717
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:30,700
you know,
eating whatever I want to eat,

1718
01:15:30,701 --> 01:15:34,360
which is what I did for 47 years and 
then wound up nearly fucking dying.

1719
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:38,290
Closes diver came to death.
I'm okay to go plant based for,

1720
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:43,360
for awhile.
Like I told the kid I'm doing it for at 

1721
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:43,360
least a year and if I can live like 
this,

1722
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:43,360
I'll keep going.
What?

1723
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:48,450
So you cut out a milk,
cheese animal products and all your 

1724
01:15:49,751 --> 01:15:49,950
meat.

1725
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:50,860
Sugar,
sugar.

1726
01:15:50,861 --> 01:15:54,550
I cut out prior.
Prior to this now when I first met you,

1727
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:58,120
you were a candy junkie and it look,
I'm still a candy junky at heart.

1728
01:15:58,121 --> 01:16:01,290
I just can't buy anymore.
I'll always be a candy junkie.

1729
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:03,310
I'm a dry drunk right now.
I'm just like,

1730
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:05,650
I wouldn't eat all the candy if you 
presented it,

1731
01:16:05,651 --> 01:16:10,651
but it was mostly the dairy and the meat
that I had to say goodbye to cut out.

1732
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:12,400
Yes.
So it was the most.

1733
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:15,370
The biggest percentage of your diet?
Probably,

1734
01:16:15,371 --> 01:16:15,820
yeah.
Yeah.

1735
01:16:15,850 --> 01:16:19,060
Especially dairy now.
What about exercise exercise?

1736
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:24,240
After the heart attack,
they don't want you to do shit for like 

1737
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,161
the first month.
So this is the only three months ago 

1738
01:16:26,161 --> 01:16:26,830
that happened.
So once the doctor gave me the a okay,

1739
01:16:26,831 --> 01:16:29,020
then I was back to walking the dog up 
the hill of the way.

1740
01:16:29,021 --> 01:16:29,510
I always did.

1741
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:34,720
Um,
I haven't gone harder than that and I 

1742
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:38,520
don't honestly like I'm so fucking lazy 
at heart that I.

1743
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:43,520
It doesn't,
some people like I love getting out 

1744
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:43,520
there and fucking helps me think and my,
not me.

1745
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,340
I can fucking think just fine at home 
smoking a joint,

1746
01:16:45,550 --> 01:16:47,590
sitting there fucking watching Kobe or 
something like that.

1747
01:16:47,591 --> 01:16:49,010
That's what you and I separate.
Right.

1748
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:50,770
You liked the physical,
like the,

1749
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:51,550
you know,
you,

1750
01:16:51,551 --> 01:16:52,720
you like the rush.
You're,

1751
01:16:52,730 --> 01:16:57,250
you're like the adrenaline junkies who 
have kind of late raise their level.

1752
01:16:57,430 --> 01:17:00,610
And so it's not enough for you to just 
sit in one place,

1753
01:17:00,611 --> 01:17:03,100
like you can do this and shocking that 
you'll do it for three hours.

1754
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:05,320
But then after this you probably do 
something like Raza,

1755
01:17:05,321 --> 01:17:08,670
bare fucking knife,
hunt of species,

1756
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:10,090
run

1757
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:12,350
the hills.
Is that what you did at run hills in the

1758
01:17:12,351 --> 01:17:17,351
morning?
That's how far a couple miles at the 

1759
01:17:17,351 --> 01:17:18,470
most I do because I'm.
That's real steep stuff.

1760
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,330
Do you listen to anything or are you 
today?

1761
01:17:20,331 --> 01:17:23,240
I did two that cheated.
I cheat when I listen to things.

1762
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:28,540
I think it's cheating was supposed to be
alone with your Bosch supposed to be in 

1763
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:32,561
a meditative state where you're just 
pushing yourself at a certain pace and 

1764
01:17:32,561 --> 01:17:32,930
when you're listening to something,
especially something cool,

1765
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:36,020
a distraction to the point where you 
hear how heavier breathing,

1766
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:41,200
but you don't think negatively about it 
because you thinking about whatever the 

1767
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:41,920
music you're listening to is like.
It's really interesting because it's.

1768
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:46,580
It's a nice trick because you can 
actually work harder and not be bothered

1769
01:17:46,581 --> 01:17:51,581
by it because you're.
You're so tuned into the music that you 

1770
01:17:51,581 --> 01:17:54,491
listened into or whatever it is.
You're really captivated with that you 

1771
01:17:54,491 --> 01:17:58,271
can keep pushing,
but most of the time I like to do it 

1772
01:17:58,271 --> 01:18:00,290
where I don't hear shit.
I just hear the pounding in my footsteps

1773
01:18:00,291 --> 01:18:05,291
and my breathing and also I have a 
logical fear of mountain lions so I 

1774
01:18:05,291 --> 01:18:05,291
don't want to.

1775
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:08,090
Did you see that story about the fucker 
outside of Seattle?

1776
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:10,340
Scared the fuck out of me.
That was terrifying.

1777
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,140
And those spots,
they weren't like.

1778
01:18:12,141 --> 01:18:13,070
Yeah.
They weren't gone.

1779
01:18:13,071 --> 01:18:13,820
Like,
Hey man,

1780
01:18:13,821 --> 01:18:17,000
we may encounter a mountain lion.
Do you know we did the right thing?

1781
01:18:17,001 --> 01:18:18,870
They swung the fucking bike.
Yeah.

1782
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:23,950
At first they tried to get big because I
go to a place called the Canyon ranch 

1783
01:18:24,261 --> 01:18:29,261
with the wife in Arizona and there's 
like one trail where they have a sign 

1784
01:18:29,261 --> 01:18:30,610
right at the gate that's like,
you know,

1785
01:18:30,650 --> 01:18:35,650
mountain lion area and it's got one of 
those little graphic tutorials on what 

1786
01:18:35,650 --> 01:18:38,150
you're supposed to do with your body.
If you encounter a mountain lion and you

1787
01:18:38,151 --> 01:18:40,490
know you're supposed to big up like the 
way they're like,

1788
01:18:40,491 --> 01:18:41,920
hey man,
if a bear is charging at you,

1789
01:18:41,921 --> 01:18:45,770
you fucking big up at it or some shit.
Same thing here that get big up,

1790
01:18:45,771 --> 01:18:47,900
grab a stick,
make noise and shit like that.

1791
01:18:47,901 --> 01:18:52,901
And that story,
those guys did exactly as told and that 

1792
01:18:52,901 --> 01:18:56,231
fucked off for a minute and then fucking
came back and that's when they start 

1793
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:56,630
swinging the bike at it.
Yeah.

1794
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:57,500
And the one guy

1795
01:18:57,610 --> 01:18:59,450
took off,
um,

1796
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:04,500
the one guy,
his friend got bit and dragged and then 

1797
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:07,291
he took off like he was going to get 
help or I don't know what he was going 

1798
01:19:07,291 --> 01:19:07,291
to do.
And the mountain lion said,

1799
01:19:07,291 --> 01:19:07,291
fuck this guy.
I'm gonna.

1800
01:19:07,291 --> 01:19:09,010
Go after you now.
And chased him,

1801
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:12,490
chased him to wait to answer it.
It killed one guy down.

1802
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:15,880
It didn't kill both guys fucked up.
One guy killed the other,

1803
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:21,000
but one guy was down.
I mean obviously I'm just reading the 

1804
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:21,000
story.
I wasn't there,

1805
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,160
but one guy was down.
Your deliberate,

1806
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:27,480
the guy who survived,
he said that he felt the mountain lions 

1807
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:30,270
fucking jaws around his head and then to
go after his friend,

1808
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,210
his friend ran and the mountain lion 
tackled his friend and killed his friend

1809
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:39,280
in the tackle or just a bit fucked him 
up man.

1810
01:19:39,630 --> 01:19:44,630
And this was not even a big cat is a 100
pound cat and it was a macerated and it 

1811
01:19:44,630 --> 01:19:45,280
wasn't doing well.

1812
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:49,360
It was probably an old Kathy Ferrell.
They're all pharaoh.

1813
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:50,200
Are they?
Yeah,

1814
01:19:50,201 --> 01:19:52,610
they're wild,
but it's like a.

1815
01:19:52,690 --> 01:19:54,400
what's the other word?
Rabid.

1816
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:55,510
Rabid.
No.

1817
01:19:55,511 --> 01:19:59,100
Most likely just old and like they're 
all fearful motherfucker there.

1818
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:03,690
The wild probably couldn't catch rabbits
anymore and shit couldn't catch dear.

1819
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:08,720
It was getting old.
You can't catch a rabbit and you're 

1820
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,741
like,
I'm going to go for this human with 

1821
01:20:10,741 --> 01:20:10,741
machine under the air.
We're so slow.

1822
01:20:10,741 --> 01:20:11,070
We are so slow.
Is that right?

1823
01:20:11,130 --> 01:20:15,270
Oh my God.
The fastest human is a joke to a cat,

1824
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:18,600
but it dear deers are so fast.
He received dear.

1825
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:21,000
Try to run away from a wolf or something
like that in the video.

1826
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:22,980
Not a wolf,
but I've seen deers runaway from us.

1827
01:20:22,981 --> 01:20:27,981
They were.
They were all around our house and 

1828
01:20:27,981 --> 01:20:27,981
fucking.
Yeah,

1829
01:20:27,981 --> 01:20:29,130
you can't even come close to catch them.
A cat could catch a person so quick,

1830
01:20:29,131 --> 01:20:29,760
but even if.

1831
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:30,180
Well,
all right,

1832
01:20:30,181 --> 01:20:35,181
so it's a 100 pound cat is still going 
to be smaller than the dude that it's 

1833
01:20:35,181 --> 01:20:35,490
attacking.
Did you ever get into fight with a house

1834
01:20:35,491 --> 01:20:36,270
cat?
Never.

1835
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:37,640
No.
I've never gotten a fight with the house

1836
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:39,240
to all animals.
I am as well,

1837
01:20:39,241 --> 01:20:42,000
but I had a feral cat.
I raised him.

1838
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:43,410
They're all fucking good.
Farrah Joe?

1839
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:43,920
No,
they're not.

1840
01:20:43,921 --> 01:20:48,921
All this is.
This is a cat that was actually born in 

1841
01:20:48,921 --> 01:20:48,921
the wild.
Really?

1842
01:20:48,921 --> 01:20:51,480
Yeah.
He was born in the wild and I had a stay

1843
01:20:51,481 --> 01:20:56,160
with him in a room to get myself used to
him and get him used to me.

1844
01:20:56,161 --> 01:20:57,660
This is pre internet too,
by the way.

1845
01:20:57,910 --> 01:21:02,910
So this is like in the nineties and so I
locked myself in a bedroom with this 

1846
01:21:02,910 --> 01:21:04,830
kitten and just brought a stack of 
books.

1847
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:07,080
I put a mattress in there,
brought a stack of books,

1848
01:21:07,081 --> 01:21:12,081
just hung out with this cat and every 
time I'd get near this cat cat would 

1849
01:21:12,081 --> 01:21:15,561
freak out and hissed at me and jump on 
the curtains and fucking literally like 

1850
01:21:15,561 --> 01:21:16,920
climb the blinds,
screaming and hissing,

1851
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:19,070
and then I finally would get my hands on
him.

1852
01:21:19,090 --> 01:21:24,090
He would immediately start purring and 
given in because once you realize it 

1853
01:21:24,090 --> 01:21:24,090
wasn't trying to eat him,
that I was his friend,

1854
01:21:24,090 --> 01:21:26,760
I would pat him and he would put,
allowed an Auntie Kat would pro.

1855
01:21:26,761 --> 01:21:31,761
It was crazy.
Like I developed this bizarre bond with 

1856
01:21:31,761 --> 01:21:33,510
this cat because the cat was so scared 
of the world.

1857
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:36,810
I mean he was that scared of every 
action every time.

1858
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:39,630
No.
And eventually calmed down and be like,

1859
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:44,670
was the only one that could,
that could touch them though I was the 

1860
01:21:44,670 --> 01:21:44,670
only person,
like my friends would come over.

1861
01:21:44,670 --> 01:21:45,930
He'd hiss at them.
He would like,

1862
01:21:45,931 --> 01:21:47,200
wow.
Like,

1863
01:21:47,201 --> 01:21:50,580
like let them know like bitch shit is 
about to get really crazy.

1864
01:21:50,730 --> 01:21:54,030
Like I'm not a regular cat,
but I could go up to him and I could pet

1865
01:21:54,031 --> 01:21:55,230
them.
He was a feral cat,

1866
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:58,140
you know what was my point?
Beginning this.

1867
01:21:58,350 --> 01:22:00,740
I Dunno what,
what did we were.

1868
01:22:01,610 --> 01:22:04,050
Oh,
I had to get them fixed.

1869
01:22:04,110 --> 01:22:05,230
This is what it was.
The cat.

1870
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,060
I had to get them fixed and I had to 
pick them up,

1871
01:22:07,061 --> 01:22:10,140
but I don't know how the fuck he knew 
that something was going on.

1872
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:10,800
Oh,
that's right.

1873
01:22:10,801 --> 01:22:12,600
Because I was trying to get them in a 
laundry basket.

1874
01:22:12,990 --> 01:22:17,990
I was trying to put them in the laundry 
basket because I wanted to bring him to 

1875
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:20,690
the doctors who tried who he trusts 
comes at him with a fucking cake.

1876
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:25,720
Not that deep into a relationship either
because he's the only like 10 or 11 

1877
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:26,580
months old.
He ran in my house,

1878
01:22:26,581 --> 01:22:31,581
man.
He's lifted his tail up and just 

1879
01:22:31,581 --> 01:22:31,581
shooting piss on my walls.
I was like,

1880
01:22:31,581 --> 01:22:32,850
Hey,
you fuck dude.

1881
01:22:32,851 --> 01:22:37,440
He pissed all over the place.
By the time I realized like I had to get

1882
01:22:37,441 --> 01:22:38,990
him to a doctor.

1883
01:22:38,990 --> 01:22:43,990
You'd Piss to my house like 10 times 
because they just piss in the house and 

1884
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:44,160
so.
And then I was worried like if you don't

1885
01:22:44,161 --> 01:22:47,320
get them quick enough,
like I've yet to clean everything up,

1886
01:22:47,321 --> 01:22:52,321
but deep clean all the carpets,
but if you don't get to him quick 

1887
01:22:52,321 --> 01:22:52,321
enough,
he just thinks,

1888
01:22:52,321 --> 01:22:54,690
well he's spraying from now on,
even after you fix them that that can be

1889
01:22:54,691 --> 01:22:59,691
a problem.
So I tried to hold onto him and put him 

1890
01:22:59,691 --> 01:23:02,040
in this laundry basket and he taught me 
the fuck up.

1891
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:07,220
He tore my arms up,
he just scratched and me and he was 

1892
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:09,720
remarkably strong.
Is a little cat.

1893
01:23:09,730 --> 01:23:13,090
And this was your friend,
like he was saying the same to me.

1894
01:23:13,091 --> 01:23:15,040
I thought you were my friend bitch.
Trying to stop.

1895
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:20,470
I know what you fucking prick.
So I had a blanket on him.

1896
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:22,720
He was hissing at me and trying to get 
out of the room.

1897
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:25,090
I had to throw a blanket at m and under 
the blanket.

1898
01:23:25,091 --> 01:23:27,730
I scooped him up and I put them in the 
laundry basket.

1899
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:32,200
And then I slowly pulled the blanket out
so he didn't suffocate while keeping the

1900
01:23:32,201 --> 01:23:33,910
lid down.
And then tape the,

1901
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,070
the uh,
the laundry basket up.

1902
01:23:36,130 --> 01:23:41,130
So I can put it in my car and he 
wouldn't jump out in my car and call my 

1903
01:23:41,130 --> 01:23:43,180
fucking face off while I'm trying to see
it in a Chevy chase movie.

1904
01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:45,760
Did you leave it at the vet and just 
walk away the.

1905
01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:49,630
That was a good friend of mine who has 
since passed on and it was a.

1906
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:52,720
He was a really.
He that guy,

1907
01:23:52,721 --> 01:23:55,100
loved animals.
Eat the cat whisperer.

1908
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:57,610
He know he knew how to take care of it.
He knew.

1909
01:23:57,611 --> 01:24:00,340
I told him the whole deal coming in and 
you know,

1910
01:24:00,341 --> 01:24:01,900
he knew he knew how to handle it.

1911
01:24:01,990 --> 01:24:03,950
He's the only vet I've ever had.
Um,

1912
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,830
cry with me over what animal.
I had a puppy that had distemper.

1913
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:13,000
A friend of mine found these puppies at 
a gas station.

1914
01:24:13,001 --> 01:24:16,390
Someone was given them away and he took 
a bunch of them and he calls me up,

1915
01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:16,900
says,
hey man,

1916
01:24:16,901 --> 01:24:18,470
you want a puppy?
They were at the gas stations.

1917
01:24:18,471 --> 01:24:19,360
Said,
yeah man,

1918
01:24:19,361 --> 01:24:22,420
bring that puppy over here,
man.

1919
01:24:22,421 --> 01:24:27,421
The puppy,
just after like a couple of days of 

1920
01:24:27,421 --> 01:24:30,271
being at the house,
we'd have these seizures like violent 

1921
01:24:30,271 --> 01:24:32,971
seizures.
We just lie down and eyes would roll 

1922
01:24:32,971 --> 01:24:33,120
back and you can just pet it a little 
bit.

1923
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:38,130
It would slowly come back.
Then it would be weak and delirious and 

1924
01:24:38,130 --> 01:24:41,041
it would know it would happen.
And then towards the end it was having 

1925
01:24:41,041 --> 01:24:42,340
them all day long.
I mean it was just all day long.

1926
01:24:42,370 --> 01:24:44,680
And that's distemper distemper.

1927
01:24:45,130 --> 01:24:46,630
So how does it manifest it?
Again,

1928
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:52,040
it's just some horrible neurological 
disease that dogs get and if they don't 

1929
01:24:52,541 --> 01:24:56,080
get the right shots when they're young 
they can get this and there's a bunch of

1930
01:24:56,081 --> 01:24:58,240
different horrible reactions and it's 
fatal.

1931
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:01,600
So I had to take him to the vet and the 
vet was like,

1932
01:25:01,601 --> 01:25:02,800
there's really nothing we could do with 
them.

1933
01:25:02,801 --> 01:25:05,110
He's having seat.
He was having seizures all night,

1934
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,910
all night.
It was awful.

1935
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:09,530
And he was like,
he's going to die any,

1936
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:11,530
you know,
any hour now,

1937
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:12,730
you know,
we're going to have to put him down.

1938
01:25:12,731 --> 01:25:16,480
So he puts them down and he comes out in
the hallway.

1939
01:25:16,481 --> 01:25:16,830
I mean,
I,

1940
01:25:16,831 --> 01:25:19,090
I held the dog,
I placed him down,

1941
01:25:19,091 --> 01:25:20,680
I gave him a kiss,
I said goodbye,

1942
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:25,570
and he put the needle in the dog and put
the dog to sleep.

1943
01:25:25,571 --> 01:25:26,880
Then we both went outside.
Man.

1944
01:25:26,881 --> 01:25:28,700
He was just crying,
just weep.

1945
01:25:30,580 --> 01:25:33,520
You know,
the guys at the job or just loved.

1946
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:34,990
He felt loved animals.
Man.

1947
01:25:34,991 --> 01:25:36,640
He had a ton of animals.
Man.

1948
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:39,610
He had cats and dogs and all kinds of 
shit.

1949
01:25:39,611 --> 01:25:44,611
And um,
he was killed by a drunk driver that 

1950
01:25:44,611 --> 01:25:44,740
was,
you know.

1951
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:46,990
Yeah.
Yeah,

1952
01:25:46,991 --> 01:25:49,510
it was rough.
That was a rough one.

1953
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:52,360
I got an email,
I believe from his daughter.

1954
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:59,170
It was a rough one.
The a super good dude,

1955
01:25:59,171 --> 01:26:00,890
man.
The WHO,

1956
01:26:00,891 --> 01:26:04,100
who are you crying more for the guy with
the dog because the dog.

1957
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:05,630
What?
You started with the dog though.

1958
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:07,820
You started getting teary.
The dog was a bummer,

1959
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,010
but it was,
it was more of a bummer.

1960
01:26:10,011 --> 01:26:14,030
Even the way he was approaching it,
just human.

1961
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:15,990
He was approaching it very humanly like,
yeah,

1962
01:26:16,030 --> 01:26:19,040
most doctors I guess or were expected 
that they're like,

1963
01:26:19,310 --> 01:26:23,480
I'm sorry if this person is passed onto 
the callous about it at all.

1964
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:24,300
You know,
his,

1965
01:26:24,301 --> 01:26:27,830
his feelings about were super raw.
That's why I would imagine I would be as

1966
01:26:27,831 --> 01:26:29,750
a doctor just like,
I'm so pockets.

1967
01:26:29,751 --> 01:26:32,600
Ra did scared the fuck out of me with 
marriage.

1968
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:38,100
He,
he would talk to me about his divorce 

1969
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:38,100
and he,
he just,

1970
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:38,630
he just grabbed me,
like,

1971
01:26:38,690 --> 01:26:39,320
grabbed me.
He goes,

1972
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:41,030
don't you fucking get married?

1973
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:45,380
Don't you ever do it?
Joking serious,

1974
01:26:45,620 --> 01:26:46,730
but he's like,
trust me,

1975
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:52,000
you don't want to do that.
You don't want to have to go through 

1976
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:52,000
this kind of a breakup.
He goes,

1977
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:52,000
he goes,
you got a girlfriend right now.

1978
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:52,760
You break up with her.
What happens?

1979
01:26:52,761 --> 01:26:54,080
You get broken up.
That's it.

1980
01:26:54,230 --> 01:26:55,820
Get breakup,
and he goes,

1981
01:26:55,821 --> 01:27:00,821
you don't have to see them in court 
every week for a year over and over 

1982
01:27:00,821 --> 01:27:05,201
again while they're just trying to take 
money from you and lying about what 

1983
01:27:05,201 --> 01:27:05,630
you've done so they can get more money 
from you.

1984
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:11,470
He went through a bad one and I believe 
some of his friends went through real 

1985
01:27:11,470 --> 01:27:11,720
bad ones too,
and just,

1986
01:27:11,721 --> 01:27:13,100
he was one of those dudes.
I was like,

1987
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:14,480
you know,
26,

1988
01:27:14,481 --> 01:27:15,440
27.
And I was like,

1989
01:27:15,441 --> 01:27:20,441
Jesus man,
you feel like this is a man of science 

1990
01:27:20,441 --> 01:27:20,441
as a doctor.
He knows what he's talking about an,

1991
01:27:20,441 --> 01:27:23,990
you know,
a wise man who knew a lot of shit.

1992
01:27:24,050 --> 01:27:25,230
So when he,
you know,

1993
01:27:25,290 --> 01:27:26,960
I was a moron.
So he grabbed me.

1994
01:27:26,961 --> 01:27:29,090
Let's listen.
Don't fucking get married,

1995
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:30,640
get married.
They got married,

1996
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:33,280
he's just a,
you know,

1997
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:35,510
he was just a guy that,
you know,

1998
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:38,480
I mean,
I really firmly believe when it comes to

1999
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:41,660
things like that,
there's just people that are supposed to

2000
01:27:41,661 --> 01:27:43,670
be doing what they're doing.
Right?

2001
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:47,010
And he was the guy that was supposed to 
be working with the animals like it.

2002
01:27:47,070 --> 01:27:48,260
It just worked,
man.

2003
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:50,480
He had the heart for it.
Veterinarian,

2004
01:27:50,481 --> 01:27:52,580
you've probably seen how many animals 
die.

2005
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:57,760
How many animals injured and still the 
guy's crying like a baby puppy is a baby

2006
01:27:58,131 --> 01:28:03,131
dog.
Nobody wants to see a baby with this 

2007
01:28:03,131 --> 01:28:03,131
world without a chance.
So the dude's got his heart in the right

2008
01:28:03,131 --> 01:28:07,871
place.
That's the guy you want to bring your 

2009
01:28:07,871 --> 01:28:07,871
animal to.
One hundred percent.

2010
01:28:07,871 --> 01:28:07,871
He's also the first guy that ever told 
me,

2011
01:28:07,871 --> 01:28:08,390
don't get my dog fixed.

2012
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:09,380
Why?
Well,

2013
01:28:09,381 --> 01:28:09,890
he said,
look,

2014
01:28:09,891 --> 01:28:11,630
he goes,
don't let your dog have babies,

2015
01:28:11,631 --> 01:28:13,130
don't be an asshole.
He goes,

2016
01:28:13,131 --> 01:28:18,131
but if you get your dog fix,
you've got to realize you're not going 

2017
01:28:18,131 --> 01:28:18,131
to have any testosterone anymore.
It's going to be tired.

2018
01:28:18,131 --> 01:28:18,890
It's going to,
it's not going to be the same dog.

2019
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,060
And I was like,
really?

2020
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:20,810
And he's like,
yeah.

2021
01:28:20,811 --> 01:28:25,811
And so of course I got my dog faced and 
just would not fucking listen to this 

2022
01:28:25,811 --> 01:28:27,470
bag fixed.
I was trying to calm him down.

2023
01:28:27,471 --> 01:28:29,130
He was a pit bull and he was very,
uh,

2024
01:28:29,131 --> 01:28:31,910
aggressive when I want it.
Did calm him down,

2025
01:28:31,911 --> 01:28:34,850
but immediately lost most of his energy.
He didn't,

2026
01:28:34,851 --> 01:28:37,590
he just didn't have the same,
the same energy anymore.

2027
01:28:37,591 --> 01:28:39,350
It was kind of like bummed out.
It was weird.

2028
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:42,200
The yellow lab that I had,
we had to,

2029
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:45,230
like,
when I first met Jennifer,

2030
01:28:45,231 --> 01:28:50,231
my wife,
she got pregnant shortly after we met 

2031
01:28:51,170 --> 01:28:52,390
Allah.
Yeah,

2032
01:28:52,550 --> 01:28:55,520
that's how fucking virile.
I'm like a,

2033
01:28:55,550 --> 01:28:58,130
like a cat.
So,

2034
01:28:58,240 --> 01:28:59,060
uh,
you know,

2035
01:28:59,090 --> 01:29:00,050
we,
we'd never,

2036
01:29:00,150 --> 01:29:01,650
like,
I'd never even a dog,

2037
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:02,070
so

2038
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:07,070
I was like,
we should get a dog to see if we'd be 

2039
01:29:07,070 --> 01:29:07,920
good parents.
And so we went to the pet store in,

2040
01:29:07,921 --> 01:29:12,921
uh,
the Menlo Park Mall in New Jersey and 

2041
01:29:12,921 --> 01:29:16,071
uh,
looked for yellow lab she had in her 

2042
01:29:16,071 --> 01:29:16,071
head,
she's like,

2043
01:29:16,071 --> 01:29:16,640
I a yellow lab when I was a kid and 
they're the best dogs for children's,

2044
01:29:16,641 --> 01:29:19,260
so let's go get a yellow lab.
I'd never had a dog in my life.

2045
01:29:19,261 --> 01:29:20,580
So I was like,
that sounds great.

2046
01:29:21,430 --> 01:29:24,000
I knew what they look like.
So we went to the pet shop,

2047
01:29:24,030 --> 01:29:29,030
try to find a yellow lab,
and we found this dog that was blonde 

2048
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:30,150
leggy yellow lab and they were marketing
it as a yellow lab,

2049
01:29:30,870 --> 01:29:35,100
but she'd been left behind.
All the other puppies had gone and she'd

2050
01:29:35,101 --> 01:29:36,620
been there perhaps a little too long.
Like,

2051
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,550
you know,
she wasn't a dog yet,

2052
01:29:38,551 --> 01:29:40,920
but she was fucking on the,
you know,

2053
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:41,650
uh,
what,

2054
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:43,200
what was the Brittany Spears Song?

2055
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:47,190
I'm not a girl,
not yet a womb.

2056
01:29:47,191 --> 01:29:50,550
And that's where the dog was,
she was too big for the fucking cage,

2057
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:53,150
like her face was pressed up against and
no.

2058
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:54,930
So we were like,
what about this dog?

2059
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:59,931
And it was been priced down,
you could see like 2000 marked all the 

2060
01:29:59,931 --> 01:30:00,330
way down to like 600 bucks.
And truly,

2061
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:05,900
so we got that dog and you never see 
like it was like something out of a 

2062
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:08,760
fucking cartoon because we were the ones
that were like,

2063
01:30:08,761 --> 01:30:11,850
get out of this cramped ass cage and 
come with us out into the parking lot.

2064
01:30:12,930 --> 01:30:15,210
Dog instantly bonded with us.
He loved us.

2065
01:30:15,270 --> 01:30:17,690
So fucking much became so needy.
Um,

2066
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:20,190
we called it scully,
we're big fans of the x files.

2067
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:25,670
So uh,
after a week of having that dog and the 

2068
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:25,670
dog was a cup in our grill all the time,
just like,

2069
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:30,740
thank you,
thank you for fucking getting me out of 

2070
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:30,740
there.

2071
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:31,500
Like you are my people and Shit.
We were like,

2072
01:30:31,501 --> 01:30:33,450
we should get another dog to babysit 
this dog.

2073
01:30:33,580 --> 01:30:35,670
This dog has a friend.
So we went,

2074
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:38,980
instead of to the pet store,
we went to a breeder's Kendall,

2075
01:30:38,990 --> 01:30:43,990
like a pedigree place and uh,
they had puppies versions of fucking 

2076
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:48,030
yellow labs and they were adorable,
like fucking 10 of them falling all over

2077
01:30:48,031 --> 01:30:49,530
each other,
like an animated,

2078
01:30:49,531 --> 01:30:53,430
like a pixar movie.
And Jennifer picks up one and bonds,

2079
01:30:53,431 --> 01:30:54,450
but they're just like,
this is the one,

2080
01:30:54,451 --> 01:30:56,110
let's get this one.
I went over to the counter,

2081
01:30:56,140 --> 01:30:57,000
I was like,
all right man,

2082
01:30:57,001 --> 01:30:59,250
we just bought a dog the week before,
600 bucks.

2083
01:30:59,251 --> 01:31:02,100
And even then I was like 600 fucking box
man.

2084
01:31:02,101 --> 01:31:02,400
They,
he,

2085
01:31:02,401 --> 01:31:03,900
they,
they throw these things out,

2086
01:31:03,901 --> 01:31:05,490
you know,
we can get one of the free and shit.

2087
01:31:06,090 --> 01:31:08,240
But I was like,
I've never paid $600 for a dog.

2088
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:13,670
So you know,
I went up to the counter expecting well 

2089
01:31:13,670 --> 01:31:13,670
that's the rate,
I guess the going rate for yellow lab,

2090
01:31:13,670 --> 01:31:18,570
600 bucks.
So I went up to the counter and I was 

2091
01:31:18,570 --> 01:31:18,570
like,
we'll take that one.

2092
01:31:18,570 --> 01:31:19,050
And The lady's like,
that'll be $4,000.

2093
01:31:19,051 --> 01:31:21,180
And it was like,
for all of them,

2094
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:22,650
I just want one.
And she's like,

2095
01:31:22,820 --> 01:31:25,830
these are pedigree dogs,
and I just met Jennifer,

2096
01:31:25,831 --> 01:31:27,840
barely knew her so I couldn't turn 
around and be like,

2097
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:30,090
put that down.
That's too expensive.

2098
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:31,980
I tried to represent.
So I was just like,

2099
01:31:32,010 --> 01:31:33,870
well,
4,000,

2100
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:36,630
we're paying too low.
We are stealing from you.

2101
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:38,970
We got that dog.
And to be fair,

2102
01:31:39,450 --> 01:31:41,610
we named a molder because again,
x files,

2103
01:31:41,611 --> 01:31:46,611
Fan scully,
and mulder and scully was just like 

2104
01:31:46,611 --> 01:31:50,151
happy heart that just loved molder was 
so smart and fucking thoughtful.

2105
01:31:52,710 --> 01:31:55,260
He wrote my four best movies.

2106
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:58,230
That's why he died.
I made tusk and Yoga hosers like without

2107
01:31:58,231 --> 01:32:01,480
that dog writing for me.
How do you write for you?

2108
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:02,350
It's a joke,
Joe.

2109
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:06,280
He was fearful because he's just saying 
he was so smart.

2110
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:08,430
He was so smart.
How smart wedding.

2111
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:10,210
He's so smart.
He wrote my last few scripts.

2112
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:13,480
Joke didn't quite land,
so I was missing something.

2113
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:18,560
I wasn't paying attention.
I didn't set it up properly and not a 

2114
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:18,560
fucking pro,
but in any event,

2115
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:18,970
um,
he uh,

2116
01:32:19,030 --> 01:32:24,030
he was wonderful,
but we got them clipped and his demeanor

2117
01:32:24,491 --> 01:32:27,050
never really changed.
He was always very low key.

2118
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:32,060
We called him kilroy because he'd go to 
the other side of the bed and just look 

2119
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:32,060
up like this.
Yeah.

2120
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:33,130
I got my massive snipped.
It didn't really change.

2121
01:32:33,131 --> 01:32:35,530
His personality stayed the same,
stayed the same,

2122
01:32:35,531 --> 01:32:37,150
but he was always kind of a mellow dog.

2123
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:40,150
We got a very big dogs.
They don't like to do too much.

2124
01:32:40,151 --> 01:32:43,330
We got a rescue last year,
year and a half ago.

2125
01:32:43,810 --> 01:32:46,840
That was like when you mother died a 
couple years ago.

2126
01:32:46,980 --> 01:32:48,580
Um,
uh,

2127
01:32:48,610 --> 01:32:49,480
he was,
uh,

2128
01:32:49,570 --> 01:32:54,570
he made it to 15,
which is like fucking old and for a big 

2129
01:32:54,570 --> 01:32:55,060
dog too,
it's pretty deep.

2130
01:32:55,061 --> 01:32:57,360
Like a doctrinal stick around,
you know,

2131
01:32:57,460 --> 01:33:00,220
fucking like cancer,
but a fucking big dog like that.

2132
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:05,580
Generally you don't make it past 10:11.
So we've got a lot of good years out of 

2133
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:08,601
him and stuff,
but it was fucking horrible when he 

2134
01:33:08,601 --> 01:33:10,261
died.
I spent the last two years of scalies 

2135
01:33:10,261 --> 01:33:11,320
life.
I'm almost as rehearsal for molder.

2136
01:33:11,350 --> 01:33:16,350
They're yellow labs.
So what usually goes first is the hips 

2137
01:33:16,350 --> 01:33:17,530
and the back legs.
So scalies back legs when she just,

2138
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:22,800
the rest of her body could work,
but she was literally dragging your 

2139
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:22,800
carcass.

2140
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:23,470
What was wrong with her legs?
They just went.

2141
01:33:23,670 --> 01:33:25,120
Dr was like,
this just happens.

2142
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:27,510
They're done.
And she was 12,

2143
01:33:27,530 --> 01:33:29,140
13.
So she'd made it a while,

2144
01:33:29,710 --> 01:33:32,530
but I will just stop working.
Just give out.

2145
01:33:32,710 --> 01:33:34,780
So the nerves start firing.
The legs stop.

2146
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:37,840
There's no muscle left in language labs.
Yeah.

2147
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:40,540
Wow.
So I put a scarf under her.

2148
01:33:40,670 --> 01:33:45,670
The back end of her called the magic 
walking scarf and I would become the 

2149
01:33:45,670 --> 01:33:49,981
back legs for her.
So she would walk and I would be the 

2150
01:33:49,981 --> 01:33:49,981
back legs and fucking get shit and piss 
all over and stuff.

2151
01:33:49,981 --> 01:33:51,520
But I'd doug the dog.
So it was no big deal.

2152
01:33:51,940 --> 01:33:54,790
So I did that all the way up to when 
Scott passed away.

2153
01:33:54,910 --> 01:33:59,410
And then molder was always very healthy 
and fucking mobile and loved walking and

2154
01:33:59,411 --> 01:34:00,730
stuff.
Super Athletic Dog.

2155
01:34:00,731 --> 01:34:02,980
Jen would take them up on Runyon Canyon 
and shit.

2156
01:34:03,610 --> 01:34:08,610
Then one day he had his back,
legs started dropping and your fucking 

2157
01:34:08,610 --> 01:34:09,310
heart sinks because your leg.
All right.

2158
01:34:09,311 --> 01:34:10,990
Scully.
She wasn't that active,

2159
01:34:10,991 --> 01:34:13,210
so when she lost her legs,
like as a bummer,

2160
01:34:13,211 --> 01:34:16,880
but she wasn't like the run around dog 
because she used to chase moldy,

2161
01:34:16,890 --> 01:34:21,890
you throw ball molded would run after 
and she would just chase molder and 

2162
01:34:21,890 --> 01:34:25,411
tried to bite his back legs to prevent 
him from doing it because she wasn't 

2163
01:34:25,411 --> 01:34:25,570
nearly as fast molder was the go out 
guy.

2164
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:28,630
He loved to fucking be active.
So when his back legs,

2165
01:34:28,631 --> 01:34:33,631
when it was like heartbreaking,
and then he stuck around for two more 

2166
01:34:33,631 --> 01:34:35,670
years.
So it was literally two years of me Walk

2167
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:37,630
Magic walking,
scarfing,

2168
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,220
uh,
this dog.

2169
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:43,420
Uh,
then he got to the place where he did,

2170
01:34:43,470 --> 01:34:44,920
you know,
it wasn't just temporary,

2171
01:34:44,921 --> 01:34:46,690
but when you were talking about it 
sounded so familiar,

2172
01:34:46,691 --> 01:34:48,940
he would do that thing,
this thing where he would be like,

2173
01:34:50,130 --> 01:34:55,130
oh,
and this will go on for fucking hours.

2174
01:34:55,450 --> 01:34:58,910
And you could tell it was exhausting him
and he couldn't fucking move.

2175
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:01,670
So,
you know,

2176
01:35:01,790 --> 01:35:04,040
everyone in the family was like,
it's time to let them go.

2177
01:35:04,041 --> 01:35:06,020
And this was like when he first lost his
legs,

2178
01:35:06,021 --> 01:35:07,460
but I was like,
are you fucking shit man,

2179
01:35:07,461 --> 01:35:12,461
if like if I lose my legs,
you better fucking put a magic walking 

2180
01:35:12,461 --> 01:35:14,240
scarf around my fat ass and not fucking 
turned me over to the needle.

2181
01:35:14,241 --> 01:35:15,950
I like,
this is fucking family here.

2182
01:35:16,790 --> 01:35:21,790
So I held onto them for as long as I 
could until he got to that place where 

2183
01:35:21,801 --> 01:35:26,060
he was like an obvious fucking pain.
And I remember I shot a video of it.

2184
01:35:26,590 --> 01:35:28,870
I'm on my phone,
I still have it and it's not,

2185
01:35:28,910 --> 01:35:30,980
you know,
it sounds fucking cruel or sick.

2186
01:35:30,981 --> 01:35:35,981
But like it was,
it was just a reminder because every 

2187
01:35:35,981 --> 01:35:39,581
once in a while like I knew eventually 
that we would have to put them down and 

2188
01:35:39,581 --> 01:35:40,760
like,
it's such a weird relationship where one

2189
01:35:40,761 --> 01:35:45,761
day you're like,
I love you to death and I love you so 

2190
01:35:45,761 --> 01:35:45,761
much,
I have to fucking kill you.

2191
01:35:45,761 --> 01:35:49,600
So I had that video on my phone for the 
longest time so that when in like the 

2192
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,620
wee small hours of the morning I would 
wake up and be like,

2193
01:35:51,621 --> 01:35:55,220
you killed your best fucking friend.
I could watch that video and be like,

2194
01:35:55,221 --> 01:35:57,710
you had to.
He had like keep wanting to go.

2195
01:35:57,711 --> 01:36:01,040
So it was sick.
So the doctor came over,

2196
01:36:01,070 --> 01:36:03,770
we got the vet to come over to the house
and um,

2197
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:08,830
it was like a big deal.
It was like we all knew it was coming 

2198
01:36:08,830 --> 01:36:11,051
and shit.
I was flying home from a Gig and I kept 

2199
01:36:11,051 --> 01:36:11,690
telling him like,
Jennifer,

2200
01:36:11,691 --> 01:36:13,970
like,
don't do anything just like freeze,

2201
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,710
like I'll be there as quickly as 
possible.

2202
01:36:16,610 --> 01:36:20,050
And so like Dr Kumar who is our vet,
uh,

2203
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:25,060
was scheduled to come over and that last
fucking hour was probably hands down the

2204
01:36:27,261 --> 01:36:28,850
most of my life,
man,

2205
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:32,340
because we all knew it was coming in 
your program to,

2206
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:37,280
to stop that at all cost program to keep
people around and keep yourself around.

2207
01:36:39,170 --> 01:36:44,170
And yet,
like we were just all sitting there 

2208
01:36:44,170 --> 01:36:46,511
loving on them,
knowing that like at the time Dr Kumar 

2209
01:36:46,511 --> 01:36:46,511
gets here,
it's all done.

2210
01:36:46,511 --> 01:36:48,890
It was fucking hard as artist thing in 
the world to do and he was still in pain

2211
01:36:48,891 --> 01:36:53,891
the whole time.
So even though you knew you were doing 

2212
01:36:53,891 --> 01:36:53,891
the right thing,
it was like,

2213
01:36:53,891 --> 01:36:55,940
like I understand why that vet,
you know,

2214
01:36:55,941 --> 01:37:00,941
got emotional stuff.
So in any event that we lost that dog a 

2215
01:37:01,551 --> 01:37:02,960
while ago,
a couple of years ago,

2216
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:08,680
and on my 45th birthday when we were 
back east doing a show with the count 

2217
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:11,450
basie theater in red bank,
we're doing yoga,

2218
01:37:11,451 --> 01:37:15,830
hosers screening it and we were shooting
it for the kind of compliment show.

2219
01:37:16,550 --> 01:37:18,890
So I was driving down the highway in 
Middletown,

2220
01:37:18,891 --> 01:37:23,891
New Jersey.
And I passed the place where we had 

2221
01:37:23,891 --> 01:37:23,891
bought molder.
And so I was just like,

2222
01:37:23,891 --> 01:37:25,520
you know what man,
I'm 45 years old.

2223
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:27,370
I'm a grown ass fucking man.
Like I,

2224
01:37:27,371 --> 01:37:29,360
I make my own money.
I can do whatever I want.

2225
01:37:29,361 --> 01:37:32,330
I'm going buy a fucking dog.
I'm going to replace that dog.

2226
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:37,360
Like,
I'm going to get me another yellow lab 

2227
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:37,360
and we've had two dogs since then,
right.

2228
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:41,501
We got a Louis,
which is a chocolate lab and check he 

2229
01:37:41,501 --> 01:37:41,501
was my favorite little miniature 
doctrine,

2230
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:43,940
but like I missed molder and I was like,
I'm going to replace them.

2231
01:37:44,030 --> 01:37:45,980
And then uh,
so I went in to the pet store,

2232
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:47,570
same place,
the puppies,

2233
01:37:47,571 --> 01:37:48,230
puppies,
puppies,

2234
01:37:48,231 --> 01:37:53,231
where we had gotten older and uh,
I walked in and I didn't see any yellow 

2235
01:37:53,231 --> 01:37:53,900
labs and there was nobody at the 
counter.

2236
01:37:53,901 --> 01:37:54,660
So I was like,
all right,

2237
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:56,580
I'll get outta here.
And The lady comes out and she's like,

2238
01:37:56,581 --> 01:37:57,450
can I help you?
And I was like,

2239
01:37:57,451 --> 01:37:58,960
um,
yeah,

2240
01:37:58,961 --> 01:37:59,640
it's was like,
wow.

2241
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:01,410
I honestly,
I came looking for a yellow lab,

2242
01:38:01,411 --> 01:38:03,270
but like,
you guys don't have any.

2243
01:38:03,271 --> 01:38:04,440
She's like,
we have one in the back.

2244
01:38:05,370 --> 01:38:06,930
And so I was like,
I'm okay,

2245
01:38:06,990 --> 01:38:07,830
can I meet him?
She said,

2246
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:08,610
oh,
sit right down.

2247
01:38:08,611 --> 01:38:10,590
They put you into a little room and 
stuff like that.

2248
01:38:10,630 --> 01:38:13,470
Then they bring the dog in and in my 
head I'm like,

2249
01:38:13,490 --> 01:38:15,460
I'm counting the money out,
you know,

2250
01:38:15,510 --> 01:38:20,510
I'm sure it's inflation has hit the dog 
market so it's going to be more than 

2251
01:38:20,510 --> 01:38:23,661
4,000,
but I'm ready to fucking go and then 

2252
01:38:23,661 --> 01:38:25,290
they bring in this puppy and he was 
good.

2253
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:28,230
He was a good dog.
He's very bouncy and energetic as fuck.

2254
01:38:28,410 --> 01:38:31,050
You could cut this dog's nuts off and it
wouldn't have mattered,

2255
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:34,650
but he wasn't molder.
He looked exactly like him,

2256
01:38:34,710 --> 01:38:39,710
but he wasn't him.
It was this weird lesson of like when 

2257
01:38:39,710 --> 01:38:43,431
it's gone,
it's gone and you need to appreciate it 

2258
01:38:43,431 --> 01:38:44,730
more when it's there because,
you know,

2259
01:38:45,090 --> 01:38:47,940
they tell you this from a young age,
but like everything,

2260
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:51,720
everything dies and nothing's fucking 
replaceable at the end of the day.

2261
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,510
So as I sat there playing with his dog,
I was like,

2262
01:38:54,511 --> 01:38:57,240
it's not like it's not him.
It's never going to be him.

2263
01:38:57,720 --> 01:39:02,720
And I would sit there,
raise the dog his whole life expecting 

2264
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:06,290
to be something else.
Somebody else out there wants this 

2265
01:39:06,290 --> 01:39:06,780
fucking hyper poppy.
Not Me,

2266
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:07,920
but I took a picture of it because I 
was,

2267
01:39:07,921 --> 01:39:12,921
I'm a fuck with my wife,
and so I took a picture of the dog and 

2268
01:39:12,921 --> 01:39:15,741
texted a tour.
My wife instantly calls me back and be 

2269
01:39:15,741 --> 01:39:15,741
like,
do not buy a fucking dog.

2270
01:39:15,741 --> 01:39:16,950
You can't do that.
I said,

2271
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:19,260
I'm a 45 year old grown ass man.
I could do what I want.

2272
01:39:19,261 --> 01:39:19,770
She goes,
no,

2273
01:39:19,771 --> 01:39:23,790
we have two older dogs at home and it'd 
be so unfair to bring a new dog into the

2274
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:26,190
house,
and she hit me on that level going like,

2275
01:39:26,191 --> 01:39:26,640
you know what?

2276
01:39:26,670 --> 01:39:27,660
You're absolutely right.
She's like,

2277
01:39:27,661 --> 01:39:29,670
you got to wait until one of the other 
dogs dies.

2278
01:39:29,671 --> 01:39:33,540
Then you could buy a new dog as it fair 
enough and two days later,

2279
01:39:33,541 --> 01:39:35,970
my wife we've,
right before we go home to Los Angeles,

2280
01:39:36,230 --> 01:39:41,230
like uncharacteristically says,
there's this dog in my twitter feed.

2281
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:43,800
Look at it,
and it looked like this,

2282
01:39:43,801 --> 01:39:48,801
a macerated fuck.
It looked like the dog from the Sarah 

2283
01:39:48,801 --> 01:39:52,320
Mclaughlin Song.
I just didn't ask like the dog from the 

2284
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:52,950
haunted mansion ride dog you see on a 
fucking can,

2285
01:39:52,951 --> 01:39:55,860
just like bones with a dog head on it 
and shit,

2286
01:39:56,670 --> 01:39:57,720
and I was like,
that's so sad.

2287
01:39:57,721 --> 01:40:02,721
She's like,
they found this dog was tied up outside 

2288
01:40:02,721 --> 01:40:04,290
of kill shelter with a rope and was 
trying to be all through the rope and so

2289
01:40:04,291 --> 01:40:09,291
these people,
they took it home to foster it but they 

2290
01:40:09,291 --> 01:40:11,391
can't keep it.
They already have six dogs so they need 

2291
01:40:11,391 --> 01:40:11,391
a home for this dog.

2292
01:40:11,391 --> 01:40:12,150
And I'm like,
okay,

2293
01:40:13,530 --> 01:40:15,210
what does that have to do with us?
And she was just like,

2294
01:40:15,211 --> 01:40:16,290
we should be the home.
I'm like,

2295
01:40:16,291 --> 01:40:21,291
what happened to like,
we can't get a new dog because it'd be 

2296
01:40:21,291 --> 01:40:21,291
unfair to the other two old dogs.
She's like,

2297
01:40:21,291 --> 01:40:21,330
Kevin,
look at this dog.

2298
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:27,140
So we went over to the lady's house and 
saw this dog that sounded like the 

2299
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:28,500
distemper case that you described with 
the puppy.

2300
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:34,190
This dog was fucking dead.
Three balls in the grave just weekly 

2301
01:40:34,190 --> 01:40:38,550
looked up at us and fucking weekly went 
right back down and shit look like hell,

2302
01:40:38,580 --> 01:40:43,580
look.
Like honestly looked like a skeleton 

2303
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:45,510
with just a dog had like glued to it,
but heartbreaking,

2304
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:47,050
you know,
and so instantly I'm like,

2305
01:40:47,110 --> 01:40:49,410
dogs on death watch.
If we bring this dog home,

2306
01:40:49,590 --> 01:40:51,060
it's going to help these people,
you know,

2307
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:52,890
so they don't have to take care of yet 
another dog,

2308
01:40:52,891 --> 01:40:57,891
but this dog is going to die on our 
watch dogging going to make it look how 

2309
01:40:57,891 --> 01:40:57,891
fucking lethargic is.

2310
01:40:57,891 --> 01:41:00,280
When we picked her up,
she felt like she was like 12 pounds and

2311
01:41:00,281 --> 01:41:04,090
this is a dog that's mixed pit pit,
fucking head artist Shit and shit.

2312
01:41:04,130 --> 01:41:07,510
She was all like a Mesa.
We took her home after a week,

2313
01:41:07,511 --> 01:41:12,511
man,
that's when she started like getting an 

2314
01:41:12,511 --> 01:41:12,511
alert and shit that had told me.
He goes,

2315
01:41:12,820 --> 01:41:13,680
I said,
what do we do for,

2316
01:41:13,690 --> 01:41:14,770
how do we fatten her up?
And he goes,

2317
01:41:14,771 --> 01:41:16,330
give her eggs is eggs.
He goes,

2318
01:41:16,331 --> 01:41:16,870
yeah,
my eggs.

2319
01:41:16,871 --> 01:41:19,870
Good for giver protein or fat and Rob,
but also be good for a coat.

2320
01:41:19,871 --> 01:41:21,400
He'll bring her hair back.
All right.

2321
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:26,880
So I started making eggs every morning.
It's just scrambled eggs and I'd give 

2322
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:26,880
her the edge,
like suck it up and shit,

2323
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:27,600
and then I was like,
these eggs are so plain,

2324
01:41:27,610 --> 01:41:29,530
so I started putting like bacon and ham 
and cheese.

2325
01:41:29,531 --> 01:41:32,980
Started making omelets for the dog and 
the dog got fucking fat,

2326
01:41:33,130 --> 01:41:35,140
quick healthy all the for.

2327
01:41:35,150 --> 01:41:40,150
Came back.
Took the dog into the vet and the 

2328
01:41:40,150 --> 01:41:40,150
doctors is like,
what the fuck happened?

2329
01:41:40,150 --> 01:41:41,410
His dogs dogs like 90 pounds.
I was like,

2330
01:41:41,411 --> 01:41:46,411
you said to give her eggs,
but given her omelets every morning he 

2331
01:41:46,411 --> 01:41:46,411
goes,
I didn't say to cook the eggs.

2332
01:41:46,420 --> 01:41:47,080
I was like,
what do you mean?

2333
01:41:47,081 --> 01:41:52,081
He's like,
you just break an egg and put it in a 

2334
01:41:52,081 --> 01:41:52,081
bowl to fucking dog.
They just eat it like you made it eggs.

2335
01:41:52,081 --> 01:41:52,490
I was like,
yeah,

2336
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:54,700
got in a fight with my wife many times 
because she was like,

2337
01:41:54,701 --> 01:41:56,020
you never made me an Omelet.
And I was like,

2338
01:41:56,021 --> 01:41:57,190
well,
the dog is dying here.

2339
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,440
So that dog,
we nursed it back to health.

2340
01:41:59,441 --> 01:42:04,441
We named it Mad Martin Marty and she 
says,

2341
01:42:04,481 --> 01:42:08,110
we all know her history.
Like she figures she's six years old.

2342
01:42:08,111 --> 01:42:12,070
The doctor guest,
she's clearly a street dog and she lives

2343
01:42:12,850 --> 01:42:13,600
in her head.

2344
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:18,600
I guess the same way that you described 
did everything was fucking terrifying.

2345
01:42:18,941 --> 01:42:23,590
Took a long time for the fucking trust 
and she loves my fucking wife.

2346
01:42:23,591 --> 01:42:28,591
Like she must understand that like she 
was the one that fucking got her into 

2347
01:42:28,591 --> 01:42:31,981
this house and shit.
So when other people come into the room 

2348
01:42:31,981 --> 01:42:36,710
just goes fucking nuts because she's 
very fucking protective of the wife and 

2349
01:42:36,710 --> 01:42:41,431
shit like that.
She could flip fast and recently we had 

2350
01:42:41,431 --> 01:42:42,100
an incident in the house because she 
doesn't get along with two other dogs,

2351
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:47,520
so we have to put up all these like what
we call a checkpoint charlies in the SC 

2352
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:47,520
series of.
Yeah,

2353
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:47,520
dog gates.
The dogs,

2354
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:49,810
cadaver dogs.
They're all female.

2355
01:42:49,811 --> 01:42:54,380
Three females that I've had problems 
with that in the past females did not.

2356
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:58,300
They don't give up the Alpha position 
like males would give up.

2357
01:42:58,330 --> 01:43:03,330
Like if you have a couple males and the 
boss will run the house.

2358
01:43:03,731 --> 01:43:07,270
Like I have two males.
One of them is 120 pounds.

2359
01:43:07,271 --> 01:43:09,340
He's,
he's a massive and the other one is a.

2360
01:43:09,341 --> 01:43:12,580
She blino English bulldog mix.
They have a very clear,

2361
01:43:12,970 --> 01:43:17,970
you know,
there's a one is way bigger so there's 

2362
01:43:17,970 --> 01:43:17,970
no issues.
So who's the boss?

2363
01:43:17,970 --> 01:43:19,690
The ones the boss,
but females,

2364
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:21,400
they don't.
They don't give up on that.

2365
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:23,330
They just like,
I'm the author.

2366
01:43:23,350 --> 01:43:25,960
Keep going after each other.
It's really common,

2367
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:31,440
really common with females,
especially if you leave them alone for 

2368
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:31,630
any length of time.
They fuck each other up,

2369
01:43:31,631 --> 01:43:32,950
man.
That it happened.

2370
01:43:33,270 --> 01:43:35,440
Not on my watch.
Thank God it happened.

2371
01:43:36,810 --> 01:43:38,380
Did it happen?
I asked her.

2372
01:43:38,410 --> 01:43:40,990
I used to have two females was terrible.
Terrible.

2373
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:43,090
Ours was.
Ours happened when I was away.

2374
01:43:43,091 --> 01:43:44,800
I was just doing a show two,
three weeks ago.

2375
01:43:44,801 --> 01:43:47,880
I was in Vancouver,
a few Canadian shows that night.

2376
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:48,220
My kids

2377
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:51,620
and then she was like Marty and check.
He got into a and I was like,

2378
01:43:51,621 --> 01:43:52,010
what?

2379
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:54,290
And check.
He is literally shine and adoption.

2380
01:43:54,291 --> 01:43:58,040
She's a minute reduction and Marty is 
the size of a football and mixed pit,

2381
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:01,490
so they've seen each other that walk 
with each other.

2382
01:44:01,491 --> 01:44:03,870
We walk them in the hills,
the walk side by side and shit.

2383
01:44:03,871 --> 01:44:08,090
But the moment you get in that house,
it just territory of why?

2384
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:10,820
Because they want your love.
Your love feels so good.

2385
01:44:10,850 --> 01:44:13,760
Like if you come over and massage them 
and another dog comes by,

2386
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:16,630
you might stop massaging them and start 
massaging that other dogs.

2387
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:18,680
They'll attack that dog.
I'm not kidding.

2388
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:21,350
That's because the dog's a hundred 
percent.

2389
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:26,380
Yeah.
Especially dogs that had been 

2390
01:44:26,380 --> 01:44:26,380
mistreated.
So jealous.

2391
01:44:26,380 --> 01:44:29,920
Yes.
My dog that had an issue with this was 

2392
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:32,171
also a dog that I got from the pound.
I got a couple from the one from the 

2393
01:44:32,171 --> 01:44:35,531
street.
She was covered in mange and I nursed 

2394
01:44:35,531 --> 01:44:35,531
her back to health in a similar story.

2395
01:44:35,531 --> 01:44:36,960
She was two years old.
She had a Greg Nipples,

2396
01:44:36,961 --> 01:44:39,320
so she had had puppies.
Wait,

2397
01:44:39,321 --> 01:44:39,810
wait,
wait.

2398
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:44,240
This dog has also ics.
What'd you call it?

2399
01:44:44,241 --> 01:44:46,100
The standard extended extended.
I said,

2400
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:47,130
ma'am,
I have the wrong foot.

2401
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:52,160
They said like,
that doesn't necessarily mean like in 

2402
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:52,160
Marty's case he was like,
I was like,

2403
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:54,230
did she have puppies?
Because it looked like she had nipples,

2404
01:44:54,231 --> 01:44:55,070
but he was like,
no.

2405
01:44:55,130 --> 01:44:58,730
It's also some cases that happens with 
dogs that are associated,

2406
01:44:58,731 --> 01:45:01,490
but I can't imagine a street dog didn't 
get laid,

2407
01:45:01,491 --> 01:45:02,600
you know?
I don't know.

2408
01:45:02,630 --> 01:45:04,940
I mean the vet said that she had had 
puppies.

2409
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:07,250
I Dunno,
I dunno why he determined that.

2410
01:45:07,340 --> 01:45:09,740
I think he had said because the nipples,
they were hanging low,

2411
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:12,180
like I always have it.
Um,

2412
01:45:12,620 --> 01:45:17,620
but the two females,
like the male got along great with both 

2413
01:45:17,620 --> 01:45:17,620
dogs.
He had no problems with them,

2414
01:45:17,690 --> 01:45:18,590
but those females,
man,

2415
01:45:18,591 --> 01:45:23,591
they would fight all the fucking time 
and they would fight whenever one of 

2416
01:45:23,591 --> 01:45:23,750
them,
when someone come over to get pet,

2417
01:45:24,140 --> 01:45:29,140
like they got into a big fight once 
because the pool guy came over and the 

2418
01:45:29,140 --> 01:45:29,240
pool guy was like,
Hey,

2419
01:45:29,241 --> 01:45:29,570
what's up?

2420
01:45:29,570 --> 01:45:34,570
Kids?
And he pat one of the dogs over the 

2421
01:45:34,570 --> 01:45:34,570
other,
the other one.

2422
01:45:34,570 --> 01:45:35,340
And so they started going after each 
other.

2423
01:45:35,341 --> 01:45:35,900
They're like,
fuck you.

2424
01:45:35,901 --> 01:45:36,470
No,
fuck you.

2425
01:45:37,050 --> 01:45:38,000
And you know,
I get this,

2426
01:45:38,001 --> 01:45:38,470
call him,
man,

2427
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:41,480
your dogs are about to fuck each other 
up over the pool guy.

2428
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:42,860
I'm like,
Oh my God,

2429
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:46,250
you're so guy.
So I had to keep the girls separate.

2430
01:45:47,570 --> 01:45:49,700
We were keeping them separate with 
gates,

2431
01:45:49,701 --> 01:45:54,701
but you know,
somebody turned back and the two wound 

2432
01:45:54,701 --> 01:45:59,411
up in the same space and fucking went at
it and so one dog's way bigger than the 

2433
01:45:59,411 --> 01:46:04,391
other.
And so the big dog little dog up by her 

2434
01:46:04,391 --> 01:46:07,190
hind quarters and was shaking the leg 
shakes a toy.

2435
01:46:07,550 --> 01:46:12,550
But meanwhile shecky was the little one 
is she has no napoleon complex so she's 

2436
01:46:12,550 --> 01:46:14,420
got no idea of like,
you're bigger than me.

2437
01:46:14,450 --> 01:46:15,230
She didn't give a fuck.

2438
01:46:15,230 --> 01:46:18,500
So as the dog,
as Marty is swinging,

2439
01:46:18,501 --> 01:46:23,501
shecky the little dog,
the little dog is swinging from side to 

2440
01:46:23,501 --> 01:46:25,850
side brightener and then swinging to the
other side and biting her.

2441
01:46:25,851 --> 01:46:28,550
She wouldn't go down dude.
Like I imagine if somebody bit me in the

2442
01:46:28,551 --> 01:46:30,530
ass and shook me from side to side,
I'd be like,

2443
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:32,780
you when.
But this dog was just like,

2444
01:46:32,970 --> 01:46:37,970
fuck fucking hell's are a stab at the.
She kept trying to go right back at her.

2445
01:46:38,510 --> 01:46:42,420
So when I came home it was fucking 
heartbreaking because I'd heard they got

2446
01:46:42,430 --> 01:46:45,080
in a fight and my daughter was like,
she's got stitches and stuff.

2447
01:46:45,410 --> 01:46:49,540
So I was prepared for stitches,
but when I got home it was like it.

2448
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:51,770
It looked fucking terrible.
Like she is.

2449
01:46:51,820 --> 01:46:54,450
She looked like a fucking walrus from 
Tusk,

2450
01:46:54,451 --> 01:46:57,900
like a Frankenstein version of her lane 
was the other dog.

2451
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:03,180
She had pieces of her like missing 
chunks out of sketchy and she was like,

2452
01:47:03,181 --> 01:47:08,181
she knew she got in trouble because 
Jennifer like put her into what we call 

2453
01:47:08,181 --> 01:47:08,181
chickens,
prisons.

2454
01:47:08,181 --> 01:47:12,891
The other side of the gate where you 
lured the dogs in the chicken and then 

2455
01:47:12,891 --> 01:47:13,320
you're locked in the bathroom and you 
could still see everybody else,

2456
01:47:13,321 --> 01:47:15,150
but there's a gate keeping you on that 
side of the room.

2457
01:47:15,390 --> 01:47:20,390
So she went to jail for that.
And you could tell she felt fucking bad 

2458
01:47:20,390 --> 01:47:23,850
about it.
But does it linger like you seem to know

2459
01:47:23,851 --> 01:47:28,851
more about dogs?
That little dogs always going to 

2460
01:47:28,851 --> 01:47:28,851
remember that fight.
They're both gonna.

2461
01:47:28,851 --> 01:47:28,851
Remember it?
Yeah.

2462
01:47:28,851 --> 01:47:30,210
If you leave them alone,
they're going to do it again.

2463
01:47:30,630 --> 01:47:33,420
The girls,
if you brought home a,

2464
01:47:33,421 --> 01:47:35,400
an extra wife,
how do you think that would work out?

2465
01:47:36,370 --> 01:47:38,610
That's exactly how it's like with dogs.

2466
01:47:39,510 --> 01:47:42,120
They don't know that they told you that.
Dr Craig,

2467
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:43,880
my friend who died.
Yeah,

2468
01:47:44,430 --> 01:47:45,210
he,
uh,

2469
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:47,550
he just said you can't have two girls.
He goes,

2470
01:47:47,620 --> 01:47:48,380
just,
they're just gonna.

2471
01:47:48,470 --> 01:47:50,850
They're going to go at it.
He goes more often than not,

2472
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:51,870
he goes like,
you leave them alone.

2473
01:47:51,871 --> 01:47:56,871
You have a nice big yard.
Doesn't matter because they're going to 

2474
01:47:56,871 --> 01:47:56,871
find out.
I want to sit there.

2475
01:47:56,871 --> 01:47:57,030
Why you sitting there?
That's my spot.

2476
01:47:57,120 --> 01:47:59,220
That's my boy.
Dogs won't do that to no boy,

2477
01:47:59,221 --> 01:48:00,880
dogs,
cats or other shit.

2478
01:48:00,881 --> 01:48:02,130
I can do that.
They can fight.

2479
01:48:02,340 --> 01:48:04,720
But boy dogs.
If the alpha.

2480
01:48:04,810 --> 01:48:07,530
This is according to dog people,
not me.

2481
01:48:07,531 --> 01:48:08,970
I don't really know what I'm talking 
about.

2482
01:48:09,210 --> 01:48:11,880
But what is the way it's been explained 
to me is that boy,

2483
01:48:11,881 --> 01:48:13,440
dogs,
for the most part,

2484
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:16,470
with few exceptions,
exceptions will pick an alpha.

2485
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:17,760
Alpha would lead the pack.

2486
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:22,820
Then unless he's challenged by a new dog
or one of the dogs gets bigger or 

2487
01:48:22,820 --> 01:48:26,481
something happens and he gets older,
unless there's some sort of a shifting 

2488
01:48:26,481 --> 01:48:27,900
of the chain of command,
he will remain the Alpha forever.

2489
01:48:28,170 --> 01:48:29,790
He's the Alpha,
he's the big dog.

2490
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:31,890
So I didn't know this about the office 
shit.

2491
01:48:31,891 --> 01:48:34,680
And with scully.
Um,

2492
01:48:34,790 --> 01:48:36,510
I was again,
a new dog owner,

2493
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:41,560
right?
So I would go to La Scala and mold out 

2494
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:44,370
and scaly would barge through the door.
He's the alpha.

2495
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:45,960
First she was,
she's the alpha.

2496
01:48:45,990 --> 01:48:50,990
So I what I would,
and I didn't know this until later in 

2497
01:48:50,990 --> 01:48:53,691
life later in her life,
what I would get like fucking shitty 

2498
01:48:53,691 --> 01:48:53,691
about it.
Like,

2499
01:48:53,691 --> 01:48:54,500
hey man,
first.

2500
01:48:54,540 --> 01:48:57,510
And so I'd hold her back and let him 
out.

2501
01:48:58,020 --> 01:49:02,520
And the betrayal on her face and the 
confusion on mother's face of like,

2502
01:49:02,521 --> 01:49:03,000
bro,
Bro.

2503
01:49:03,030 --> 01:49:03,390
No,
no,

2504
01:49:03,410 --> 01:49:03,800
no,
no.

2505
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:05,130
Let her go.
Let her go,

2506
01:49:05,131 --> 01:49:10,131
Bro.
Isn't it funny how we attached these 

2507
01:49:10,131 --> 01:49:12,021
human characteristics to animals?
We decide that we're going to stop 

2508
01:49:12,021 --> 01:49:13,380
bullying amongst like I know the order 
of things.

2509
01:49:13,381 --> 01:49:15,690
You should go first.
Bullying and grade school,

2510
01:49:15,691 --> 01:49:18,780
bad bullying and dogs.
You Ain't gonna do shit about it.

2511
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:20,190
You just let it,
let that go.

2512
01:49:20,370 --> 01:49:21,630
Just don't let them fight with each 
other.

2513
01:49:21,631 --> 01:49:22,580
But I,
my,

2514
01:49:22,860 --> 01:49:24,750
my two,
my two older dogs,

2515
01:49:25,020 --> 01:49:27,180
they own the only ones that have issues.
Marshall's,

2516
01:49:27,210 --> 01:49:29,340
the younger dog.
He runs circles around everybody.

2517
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:33,850
When I opened the door to feed them,
the big one comes in first every time.

2518
01:49:33,851 --> 01:49:35,340
And if the little ones to close the 
door,

2519
01:49:35,550 --> 01:49:40,550
he'll fucking sideswipe bitch.
I'm eating first as we would clear 

2520
01:49:41,370 --> 01:49:42,990
rules.
But I let them do it.

2521
01:49:42,991 --> 01:49:44,670
They don't fight with each other,
you know,

2522
01:49:44,671 --> 01:49:45,090
they,
they're,

2523
01:49:45,091 --> 01:49:46,950
they're cool with everything.
But this is just the,

2524
01:49:46,990 --> 01:49:48,580
the,
the leadership

2525
01:49:48,940 --> 01:49:53,940
that they've established and it's one of
those things that like hit me in the 

2526
01:49:53,940 --> 01:49:54,970
wrong way because I'm not an animal.
You know what?

2527
01:49:54,971 --> 01:49:55,720
I'm sad.
I'm like,

2528
01:49:55,721 --> 01:49:58,270
I like,
they've obviously got a system down.

2529
01:49:58,271 --> 01:50:00,100
They've worked it out.
Everything's fucking cool.

2530
01:50:00,101 --> 01:50:03,220
My friend Whitney Cummings knows way 
more about dogs and animals than I do.

2531
01:50:03,221 --> 01:50:07,930
She actually has like a horse that she 
raises that's like a rescue horse.

2532
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:13,090
She rides it with no saddle and she has 
a bunch of dogs and weight rescue horse.

2533
01:50:13,150 --> 01:50:14,830
Somebody like gunbarrel?
No,

2534
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:16,210
it's a,
it's a horse.

2535
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:19,810
I think they use them for movies and 
stunt horses.

2536
01:50:19,811 --> 01:50:24,811
And stuff like that.
They don't have one person who owns 

2537
01:50:24,811 --> 01:50:26,971
them.
Some horses get abandoned and she 

2538
01:50:26,971 --> 01:50:29,071
rescued this one horse.
So very similar to what happens with 

2539
01:50:29,071 --> 01:50:29,071
dogs.
Someone abandons a horse,

2540
01:50:29,380 --> 01:50:31,450
horses get abused.
In fact,

2541
01:50:31,451 --> 01:50:35,080
I was talking to cat Zingano the other 
day too,

2542
01:50:35,081 --> 01:50:40,081
is one of the top UFC bantamweight 
fighters and she was talking about 

2543
01:50:40,081 --> 01:50:44,790
equine therapy too,
that she's worked with horses and takes 

2544
01:50:44,790 --> 01:50:46,330
care of horses and there's something 
about a human bond with a horse.

2545
01:50:46,330 --> 01:50:50,140
You're petting a horse and riding a 
horse and feeding a horse is like a very

2546
01:50:50,141 --> 01:50:53,230
good love bond that people develop with 
horses.

2547
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:55,300
But in Whitney knows a shitload about 
animals.

2548
01:50:55,301 --> 01:50:58,450
My point she,
when I talked to her about her dogs,

2549
01:50:58,600 --> 01:50:59,530
she's like,
she goes,

2550
01:50:59,531 --> 01:51:00,310
well,
I'm the boss.

2551
01:51:00,430 --> 01:51:02,050
She goes,
I don't walk around them.

2552
01:51:02,051 --> 01:51:03,820
I walked through them.
I've walked through them.

2553
01:51:03,821 --> 01:51:07,840
I pad out of my fucking way like we have
a real clear,

2554
01:51:08,140 --> 01:51:10,420
like there's a power structure in the 
house.

2555
01:51:10,660 --> 01:51:14,590
Whitney's the top boss and then all the 
dogs have to just deal with her.

2556
01:51:14,830 --> 01:51:17,140
So she's,
she's the 100 percent.

2557
01:51:17,350 --> 01:51:19,900
She pushes him out of the way she 
decides when they eat.

2558
01:51:20,050 --> 01:51:22,390
She makes them sleep and pens like she,
she.

2559
01:51:22,630 --> 01:51:23,710
Oh really?
Yeah.

2560
01:51:23,740 --> 01:51:25,810
She gives them rules.
Yeah.

2561
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:27,880
Still a lot of structured.
Pretty gangster.

2562
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:29,080
Yeah.
She's uh,

2563
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:31,300
she's not want to be mothered in that 
way.

2564
01:51:31,430 --> 01:51:34,570
You get your,
get your dogs.

2565
01:51:34,690 --> 01:51:35,800
She's like,
they're not people.

2566
01:51:35,801 --> 01:51:40,801
And we attached these human 
characteristics and needs to them and 

2567
01:51:40,801 --> 01:51:40,801
that's not what they want,
what they want.

2568
01:51:40,801 --> 01:51:44,941
It's order and they want you to be.
They want love and a lot of affection 

2569
01:51:44,941 --> 01:51:46,300
and they want exercise and all those 
other great things in good food.

2570
01:51:46,420 --> 01:51:48,640
But they also want order and her order 
is,

2571
01:51:48,670 --> 01:51:50,520
she's the fucking boss.
She's the boss.

2572
01:51:50,530 --> 01:51:52,210
That makes sense.
It totally makes sense.

2573
01:51:52,211 --> 01:51:54,430
Yeah.
She's read a shitload of books on it.

2574
01:51:54,790 --> 01:51:58,120
I've read a couple books like way,
way back in the day on dogs.

2575
01:51:58,121 --> 01:52:00,010
I read some books on dogs,
but I don't know enough.

2576
01:52:00,070 --> 01:52:05,070
All my information species picked up 
from fucking vets and also probably a 

2577
01:52:05,070 --> 01:52:07,900
lot of theories that I stitched together
for me to project onto the animals,

2578
01:52:07,901 --> 01:52:10,540
like fucking crazy.
Do you give your dogs boys and shit like

2579
01:52:10,541 --> 01:52:11,350
that?
Voices?

2580
01:52:11,410 --> 01:52:16,410
Yeah.
Like do you do the dog's life for your 

2581
01:52:16,410 --> 01:52:16,410
wife and stuff?
Like I'm always like,

2582
01:52:16,410 --> 01:52:16,630
no,
you don't.

2583
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:20,380
I do sometimes for Marshall because he 
so silly because he's such a silly dog,

2584
01:52:20,381 --> 01:52:21,100
so you'll be like,
oh,

2585
01:52:21,101 --> 01:52:23,170
you're a silly.
There you go.

2586
01:52:23,650 --> 01:52:27,790
Bugging my voice for Shecky is I check 
him in my world.

2587
01:52:27,820 --> 01:52:30,460
The little doctrine calls me the man.
She doesn't know my name.

2588
01:52:30,461 --> 01:52:33,520
She just knows me as the man.
She knows my wife has that lady,

2589
01:52:33,970 --> 01:52:34,790
so she's always there.
Sick

2590
01:52:34,860 --> 01:52:36,030
man.
He's home.

2591
01:52:36,270 --> 01:52:37,300
Oh,
I love the man.

2592
01:52:37,410 --> 01:52:40,900
He's the pits and food because I.
I wonder how they view me.

2593
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:44,520
Did they view me as an Alpha because I'm
the guy that's like,

2594
01:52:44,550 --> 01:52:45,780
I'll take you out a walk.
I'm going to

2595
01:52:46,030 --> 01:52:51,030
this deeper.
Your larger and you would be the most 

2596
01:52:51,030 --> 01:52:51,860
intimidating if you had to fight to the 
death,

2597
01:52:52,580 --> 01:52:55,460
but they don't see me like that because 
they've never even seen me be mad,

2598
01:52:55,461 --> 01:53:00,461
but I'm always like to hear your voice.
You have a fight with my wife and like 

2599
01:53:01,580 --> 01:53:03,560
you guys are arguing,
yelling at each other for sure,

2600
01:53:03,561 --> 01:53:06,410
but the fact that you have a deep voice 
mean that it,

2601
01:53:06,590 --> 01:53:10,220
that it shows your mail,
that's enough for them to.

2602
01:53:10,221 --> 01:53:15,221
Not yet but are all right,
but let's say like Chucky I've had for 

2603
01:53:15,221 --> 01:53:15,950
13 years,
over 13 years.

2604
01:53:15,951 --> 01:53:18,620
This little dog knows,
like I got him wrapped around my finger.

2605
01:53:18,621 --> 01:53:23,621
I couldn't do anything.
I want the way you talk and way you 

2606
01:53:23,621 --> 01:53:23,621
look.
Yeah.

2607
01:53:23,621 --> 01:53:26,390
If a guy the size of Lebron James was 
right next to you with is fucking crazy.

2608
01:53:26,391 --> 01:53:29,330
Deep voice and super powerful body and 
he talked to that dog.

2609
01:53:29,540 --> 01:53:31,390
That dog would listen to him.
Oh,

2610
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:32,240
we're going to be like,
oh,

2611
01:53:32,330 --> 01:53:34,350
that's the boss finally.
Unreal,

2612
01:53:34,430 --> 01:53:34,810
man.
Yeah.

2613
01:53:35,060 --> 01:53:36,290
Well,
there's just a hundred percent.

2614
01:53:36,291 --> 01:53:41,291
No doubt about it.
That's a way bigger organism than that 

2615
01:53:41,291 --> 01:53:41,291
dog.
Right?

2616
01:53:41,291 --> 01:53:42,320
And it's talking with his deep voice and
it has confidence.

2617
01:53:42,321 --> 01:53:42,850
Like,
Yep,

2618
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:44,970
whatever you need.
I'm just going to lay down right here,

2619
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:49,870
but if you were like some little,
what's that fella like?

2620
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:52,580
Give me a small person's name.
Her villa.

2621
01:53:52,590 --> 01:53:54,110
Shay's the no,
no,

2622
01:53:54,111 --> 01:53:57,680
no.
I meant like very thin wispy Tony.

2623
01:53:58,100 --> 01:53:59,990
Tony Hinchcliffe.
Well Tony Hinchcliffe.

2624
01:53:59,991 --> 01:54:03,410
So when Tony was 20,
let's say that and he tried to,

2625
01:54:03,411 --> 01:54:06,430
you know,
talk to the same dog in the same room.

2626
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:09,260
The dog would be like dismissive,
like something used to Lebron James.

2627
01:54:09,261 --> 01:54:11,940
Give me directions.
I have called that a boy's,

2628
01:54:11,970 --> 01:54:14,120
he'll you call that timber.
I might be able to eat,

2629
01:54:14,121 --> 01:54:17,210
you know,
so I think like with Whitney's case,

2630
01:54:17,211 --> 01:54:20,180
she doesn't leave any room for any gray 
area.

2631
01:54:20,210 --> 01:54:23,770
She just runs the roost but she's super 
affectionate with her daughter.

2632
01:54:23,771 --> 01:54:26,560
So all these pictures on instagram or 
her cuddling with her dog.

2633
01:54:26,561 --> 01:54:28,220
She,
she clearly loves dogs,

2634
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:31,100
but she's cage to the book.
She's like,

2635
01:54:31,130 --> 01:54:36,130
how to take care of your fucking cage.
Some people sleep with their dogs and 

2636
01:54:36,130 --> 01:54:36,130
shit,
which is cool,

2637
01:54:36,130 --> 01:54:38,930
but the dogs are farting in your face 
and stuff and you're trying to sleep and

2638
01:54:38,931 --> 01:54:41,810
they're snoring.
Like you're losing sleep for a dog.

2639
01:54:42,070 --> 01:54:45,500
I don't know about all that.
I don't know if that's the move bro.

2640
01:54:45,501 --> 01:54:47,590
You literally cried about a puppy.
I know,

2641
01:54:47,640 --> 01:54:52,640
but now you're gonna.
Tell me like I draw a lot of dog farts 

2642
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:52,760
on care.
I'll fucking cute to have your own bed.

2643
01:54:52,761 --> 01:54:53,690
Dude.
It's over there.

2644
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:55,430
You go over there.
I'm in here.

2645
01:54:55,820 --> 01:54:59,690
Let me call me boo with you.
They take their dog shit smeared.

2646
01:54:59,690 --> 01:55:03,360
Pause and rub your sheets with them and 
touch your pillow.

2647
01:55:03,420 --> 01:55:05,660
That's part of the fleet part of the 
deal.

2648
01:55:05,661 --> 01:55:07,310
That's why they don't sleep in the bed.
Man.

2649
01:55:07,311 --> 01:55:10,600
This is ridiculous.
Sleep in the bed with the dog.

2650
01:55:10,630 --> 01:55:12,680
She got very short hair too.
When I was in high school,

2651
01:55:12,681 --> 01:55:15,710
my dog had fleas real bad and I had 
fleas in my carpet.

2652
01:55:15,711 --> 01:55:17,180
It was fucking rough,
man.

2653
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:21,980
I would go through the house and I would
find fleas on my calves like in the walk

2654
01:55:22,070 --> 01:55:25,550
on my carpet from my bed to the bathroom
in the hallway.

2655
01:55:25,551 --> 01:55:30,551
I would have fleas on my leg.
When I lived with my parents in New 

2656
01:55:30,551 --> 01:55:31,760
Jersey at 21 Jackson Street,
we were kept people.

2657
01:55:31,790 --> 01:55:33,920
He turned out flea me.
Motherfuckers in here comes,

2658
01:55:33,921 --> 01:55:37,190
watch this.
I am about to pull out my dick and throw

2659
01:55:37,191 --> 01:55:41,960
it on the table against your own fleet.
We had cats and the cats,

2660
01:55:41,961 --> 01:55:44,010
a lot of them are outside so they would 
come in with

2661
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:46,140
fleas and we'd never had pets when I was
a small child.

2662
01:55:46,141 --> 01:55:47,940
We didn't start getting cats in our 
house.

2663
01:55:47,941 --> 01:55:49,620
Tell us about 12,
13 or something.

2664
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:54,150
So my mom like having no prior 
experience with cats and stuff.

2665
01:55:54,151 --> 01:55:57,300
Decided that like the flea problems are 
too much.

2666
01:55:57,301 --> 01:55:59,580
We have to give the cats baths with,
you know,

2667
01:55:59,581 --> 01:56:02,400
fucking flee shampoo and stuff.
So you'd do that.

2668
01:56:02,401 --> 01:56:05,540
And cats don't like to be anywhere near 
water and shit.

2669
01:56:05,541 --> 01:56:07,170
Like oh my God,
it was terrible.

2670
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:12,200
Get scratched up while I know because my
mother also insisted that I clipped the 

2671
01:56:12,200 --> 01:56:15,861
cat's toenails first.
She wanted them like declawed and I was 

2672
01:56:15,861 --> 01:56:15,861
like,
you can't do that.

2673
01:56:15,861 --> 01:56:16,560
Been like,
cats need their fucking clause in nature

2674
01:56:16,561 --> 01:56:17,520
and shit.
She was like,

2675
01:56:17,521 --> 01:56:19,320
well you have to clip the cuts.
Kona toe nails.

2676
01:56:19,321 --> 01:56:21,490
They do that at the vet all the time.
So you know,

2677
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:23,480
you take off the hooky point part man.

2678
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:25,350
Right.
And then you don't like that,

2679
01:56:25,410 --> 01:56:27,450
they don't like it,
but they like it better than if you took

2680
01:56:27,451 --> 01:56:29,130
the fucking clause out altogether and 
shit.

2681
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:33,030
Um,
so I used to bathe the cat and then when

2682
01:56:33,031 --> 01:56:38,031
you bathed in the cat with flea shampoo,
every fucking flee comes to the surface 

2683
01:56:38,850 --> 01:56:43,850
to try to live.
And so they would fill the fucking sink 

2684
01:56:43,980 --> 01:56:48,980
in the water and you know,
they're dying in the water because the 

2685
01:56:48,980 --> 01:56:51,771
shampoo is in the water as well.
But my mom would always take it a step 

2686
01:56:51,771 --> 01:56:54,801
further.
She would give me a set of tweezers and 

2687
01:56:54,801 --> 01:56:56,050
she would be like,
get that one and I would fucking pull a,

2688
01:56:56,170 --> 01:57:00,240
a flea off the cat and you have to press
really fucking hard because they're kind

2689
01:57:00,241 --> 01:57:05,241
of flat to kill them.
Otherwise they just jump away and then 

2690
01:57:05,241 --> 01:57:05,241
come back to the cat when it's dry.

2691
01:57:05,241 --> 01:57:07,470
That was like my,
it wasn't a set schedule.

2692
01:57:07,471 --> 01:57:09,150
Like every Tuesday night I made the 
cats.

2693
01:57:09,151 --> 01:57:11,700
But once a week my mom would be like,
you have to bathe the cats.

2694
01:57:11,810 --> 01:57:15,180
So once that included the fleeing,
did you ever get rid of the fleas?

2695
01:57:15,181 --> 01:57:16,260
Never ever,
you know,

2696
01:57:16,261 --> 01:57:18,740
what got rid of the fleas were,
there was a storm.

2697
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:24,200
They eventually,
it was the Nor'easter of 92 on the east 

2698
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:25,500
coast.
We had this big storm,

2699
01:57:25,501 --> 01:57:27,690
like it was Kinda like a Hurricane 
Sandy,

2700
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:32,840
but though not as big and our town got 
flooded including like our neighborhood 

2701
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:34,740
and we had like 30 outdoor cats that my 
dad would feed.

2702
01:57:35,130 --> 01:57:37,650
We were finding those cats for like 
weeks after the flood.

2703
01:57:37,651 --> 01:57:42,651
People will be like,
we found six of your cats under our 

2704
01:57:42,651 --> 01:57:42,651
house.
And we're like,

2705
01:57:42,651 --> 01:57:42,651
they're not our cats.
Number one,

2706
01:57:42,651 --> 01:57:46,290
they arrive or drowned.
Dead Lot of these poor cats on fences.

2707
01:57:47,730 --> 01:57:51,080
Did I hit that maximum impact?
Dead.

2708
01:57:51,420 --> 01:57:52,590
Very theatrical.
Um,

2709
01:57:52,670 --> 01:57:55,530
we found a few like holding on to 
fences,

2710
01:57:55,531 --> 01:57:56,940
you know,
like escape.

2711
01:57:56,941 --> 01:57:58,530
The floodwaters was fucking 
heartbreaking.

2712
01:57:58,680 --> 01:58:01,300
Smart ones went up and trees though.
And they stuck around and live.

2713
01:58:01,350 --> 01:58:04,140
But after that flood,
no fleas whatsoever,

2714
01:58:04,170 --> 01:58:07,770
but not nearly as many cats either.
That might've helped Christ.

2715
01:58:09,090 --> 01:58:10,620
Yeah.
Forever cat guy.

2716
01:58:10,621 --> 01:58:12,720
Or were you always a dog person?
I've always had cats.

2717
01:58:13,110 --> 01:58:14,220
Yeah.
I've always had both.

2718
01:58:15,510 --> 01:58:18,600
Pretty much.
That's why I really don't want to die at

2719
01:58:18,601 --> 01:58:20,580
the paws of a mountain cat.
Well,

2720
01:58:20,581 --> 01:58:23,360
I just know what they are.
Nasty.

2721
01:58:23,380 --> 01:58:28,380
No fucking super predators.
They catch deer with their face when 

2722
01:58:28,380 --> 01:58:29,140
they killed deer with their face.
They,

2723
01:58:29,150 --> 01:58:31,670
they use their face to kill a deer.
I mean,

2724
01:58:31,930 --> 01:58:34,470
they bite it in the neck.
They tackle it and take it down.

2725
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:37,770
That's why mountain cats are scary.
They're unbelievably powerful.

2726
01:58:37,940 --> 01:58:41,650
I had this Guy Donnie Vinson in here,
yesterday's a outdoor maker,

2727
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:46,300
and he was talking about a cat that 
these guys had hunted and killed.

2728
01:58:46,450 --> 01:58:49,960
They weighed 200 pounds and it was two 
years old,

2729
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:53,590
two years old,
and weigh 200 pounds.

2730
01:58:53,740 --> 01:58:58,740
It had been eating so many deer,
just that it was just this massive 

2731
01:58:59,060 --> 01:59:04,060
jacked fucking Super Predator has just 
roaming through the forest and ask those

2732
01:59:04,421 --> 01:59:07,180
guys in Seattle that survived.
The one guy that survived,

2733
01:59:07,181 --> 01:59:12,181
the one guy that died from that attack,
the mountain bike attack are fucking 

2734
01:59:12,181 --> 01:59:13,780
terrifying animals.
Why?

2735
01:59:13,781 --> 01:59:18,781
Um,
so do you think they attack the people 

2736
01:59:18,781 --> 01:59:18,781
just because they were like,
we're fucking hungry?

2737
01:59:18,781 --> 01:59:22,860
Yes.
It was just always a macerated I think 

2738
01:59:22,860 --> 01:59:22,860
that's exactly.
He tried to eat them.

2739
01:59:22,860 --> 01:59:26,030
He wanted to eat them.
He was starving and so he knew that they

2740
01:59:26,031 --> 01:59:31,031
were an organism.
There weren't a normal thing on the 

2741
01:59:31,031 --> 01:59:31,031
diet,
but it was so risky.

2742
01:59:31,031 --> 01:59:34,420
It was so rather I'm hungry that it was 
willing to take those risks.

2743
01:59:34,450 --> 01:59:39,450
It was willing to go after some people 
even though the people are swinging 

2744
01:59:39,450 --> 01:59:42,631
their bike at it,
and that was part of the story that got 

2745
01:59:42,631 --> 01:59:43,870
me the most because you're like,
that's what I would do.

2746
01:59:43,871 --> 01:59:47,440
I guess I would swing the bucket and you
would think this bike will save me,

2747
01:59:47,441 --> 01:59:52,441
but no,
it brings it back to my story about the 

2748
01:59:52,441 --> 01:59:52,441
house cat.
When I threw the blanket on him,

2749
01:59:52,441 --> 01:59:53,200
dude,
I couldn't believe how strong he was.

2750
01:59:53,530 --> 01:59:56,170
He was so strong because he was fighting
for his life.

2751
01:59:56,171 --> 02:00:01,171
He thought I was going to kill him,
so I'm trying to stuff them into this 

2752
02:00:01,171 --> 02:00:04,350
laundry basket.
He's going fucking crazy and all his 

2753
02:00:04,350 --> 02:00:06,700
thinking is,
what is this cat weigh eight pounds,

2754
02:00:07,060 --> 02:00:12,060
like maybe eight pounds.
I'm fucking terrified of them to do is 

2755
02:00:12,060 --> 02:00:15,631
catch a juggler.
It's a little more complicated than 

2756
02:00:15,631 --> 02:00:15,631
that.
Is it?

2757
02:00:15,631 --> 02:00:15,631
Yeah.
It'd be hard.

2758
02:00:15,631 --> 02:00:16,930
What do you mean?
Put your hand on it.

2759
02:00:16,950 --> 02:00:19,900
Stopped the bleeding and it's not going 
to kill you like a lion kills you,

2760
02:00:20,890 --> 02:00:23,710
but what if it got both sets of clause?
What?

2761
02:00:23,740 --> 02:00:26,650
Alright.
When a tiger claws onto your juggling.

2762
02:00:27,070 --> 02:00:29,140
Shredding it in so many different 
directions.

2763
02:00:29,141 --> 02:00:31,530
Really it's not.
It's mostly give can be killed by.

2764
02:00:31,820 --> 02:00:33,750
She'll scratches.
It's.

2765
02:00:33,970 --> 02:00:36,530
It's very rare that someone gets killed 
by a house cat.

2766
02:00:36,630 --> 02:00:37,090
All right.
Here.

2767
02:00:37,091 --> 02:00:42,091
Here's the situation.
You're fucking a house cat and it 

2768
02:00:42,091 --> 02:00:42,230
reaches back and claws into your femoral
artery,

2769
02:00:42,250 --> 02:00:44,450
but you should let it go.
But a cat.

2770
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:50,040
It's clearly not continually this point.
Clearly if you fought to the death with 

2771
02:00:50,040 --> 02:00:51,880
a house cat,
I would bet on you you would win,

2772
02:00:52,420 --> 02:00:54,280
but it would be ugly,
but it would be.

2773
02:00:54,310 --> 02:00:56,860
But what the force that you can generate
is lethal.

2774
02:00:57,070 --> 02:00:59,530
The force that it can generate is 
ferocious,

2775
02:00:59,740 --> 02:01:02,800
but nonlethal like if you put me in a 
room with a cat,

2776
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:06,700
I'm coming out of that fucking room 
hundred percent of the time with a house

2777
02:01:06,701 --> 02:01:08,020
cat.
It's going to be dead.

2778
02:01:08,260 --> 02:01:09,670
I'm going to kill that cat.
Yeah,

2779
02:01:09,671 --> 02:01:11,720
but it's gonna fuck me up in the 
process,

2780
02:01:11,740 --> 02:01:15,040
so scratched up.
I'm going to have bloody hands.

2781
02:01:15,041 --> 02:01:20,041
I might get my face clawed up,
but I'm going to kill it as soon as I 

2782
02:01:20,041 --> 02:01:22,480
think gets to half my size.
I'm dead.

2783
02:01:22,900 --> 02:01:24,370
Is that my size?
Yeah.

2784
02:01:24,580 --> 02:01:26,620
Fit.
Not even one quarter of my size.

2785
02:01:26,660 --> 02:01:31,540
When I say it's a 50 pound cat,
I'm fucked because it's too powerful.

2786
02:01:31,930 --> 02:01:35,530
Fifty pound cat is like 150 pound,
200 pound man.

2787
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:40,680
Plus they have fangs.
They have claws that it would be much 

2788
02:01:40,680 --> 02:01:44,351
stronger and faster.
You wouldn't be able to stop it from 

2789
02:01:44,351 --> 02:01:44,351
biting you and clawing at you.

2790
02:01:44,351 --> 02:01:46,010
It would be too big and if you've got to
100 pounds,

2791
02:01:46,130 --> 02:01:49,160
you're fucking dead.
If it gets to 200 pounds,

2792
02:01:49,250 --> 02:01:51,410
your super dead,
you're dead quick.

2793
02:01:51,411 --> 02:01:54,110
It'll crush your head.
It's going to grab a hold of your neck,

2794
02:01:54,230 --> 02:01:56,660
it's going to crush her esophagus 
crusher,

2795
02:01:56,720 --> 02:01:58,120
windpipe,
and it's going to.

2796
02:01:58,220 --> 02:02:02,510
It has sensors in its tafe like certain 
certain big cats.

2797
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:06,620
They can feel where your veins are with 
their teeth,

2798
02:02:06,770 --> 02:02:10,560
their teeth have like a a sense where 
we're like,

2799
02:02:11,300 --> 02:02:16,300
you know how like you ever eat something
and you feel like a hard piece of 

2800
02:02:16,300 --> 02:02:20,951
something,
like maybe you're eating a crab or 

2801
02:02:20,951 --> 02:02:20,951
something like that little piece of 
shell gets in there.

2802
02:02:20,951 --> 02:02:25,030
You've got to move that shell around 
inside your mouth while you're chewing 

2803
02:02:25,030 --> 02:02:28,960
and you get the shell over here.
That sense of moving your tongue and 

2804
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:33,041
knowing what that.
That cat has a with a with a fan and 

2805
02:02:33,081 --> 02:02:38,081
knows how to hit like an antelopes 
juggled a lion when it bites into 

2806
02:02:38,081 --> 02:02:39,320
something,
so tell you where the blood is.

2807
02:02:39,470 --> 02:02:41,460
It feels where the veins are,
think he does,

2808
02:02:42,150 --> 02:02:43,700
but it doesn't want the blood.
Right.

2809
02:02:43,701 --> 02:02:46,490
It's just like,
I know that if I break this thing,

2810
02:02:46,491 --> 02:02:48,230
this thing will stop moving and I can 
eat it.

2811
02:02:48,231 --> 02:02:51,620
It's mostly cut off the air if you see 
mostly what they do.

2812
02:02:51,621 --> 02:02:54,260
Mostly what they do is crush the neck.
They there.

2813
02:02:54,290 --> 02:02:58,550
It's more of that than it is like cut 
you like a knife would cut your juggler.

2814
02:02:58,820 --> 02:03:00,710
It's mostly crushing everything.
Few.

2815
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:05,800
If you had the presence of mind,
like let's say this thing is crushing 

2816
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:08,891
your windpipe,
can you reach up and choke a cat to 

2817
02:03:08,891 --> 02:03:08,891
death?
I don't think so.

2818
02:03:08,891 --> 02:03:09,440
Why?
Because I think they're too strong.

2819
02:03:09,560 --> 02:03:10,820
I think.
What do you mean straws?

2820
02:03:10,910 --> 02:03:15,910
They're too strong.
So would it be swarmed at you or 

2821
02:03:15,910 --> 02:03:16,580
something or too much?
Muscle or muscle?

2822
02:03:16,581 --> 02:03:18,770
Both of you put your fingers in his 
eyes.

2823
02:03:18,890 --> 02:03:22,520
That would be one of the only things 
that I could think might have an effect,

2824
02:03:22,521 --> 02:03:24,590
but it would probably just be a second 
one as the second one.

2825
02:03:24,830 --> 02:03:27,020
You Jam your finger up the cat's ass.
Instantly.

2826
02:03:27,021 --> 02:03:30,320
It stops their son.
How are you going to get way back down?

2827
02:03:31,650 --> 02:03:34,600
That's what I do with my last few 
breaths,

2828
02:03:34,610 --> 02:03:35,390
dude.
No Way.

2829
02:03:35,391 --> 02:03:38,720
A few feet away and you same way that 
little kitten was attacking you.

2830
02:03:38,721 --> 02:03:42,470
It's like I'm a fuck you up.
I would leave this life and the mouth of

2831
02:03:42,471 --> 02:03:47,471
a big cat with my fingers up its ass.
It would know that I was there before I 

2832
02:03:47,471 --> 02:03:50,240
left this fucking world because if you 
stick your finger up a dog's ass,

2833
02:03:50,270 --> 02:03:52,130
it breaks.
It's concentration doesn't.

2834
02:03:52,190 --> 02:03:52,850
No,
no.

2835
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:55,250
That's an old wives' tale.
Know you ever see two pit bulls fighting

2836
02:03:55,251 --> 02:03:56,750
each other?
Stick your finger up their ass.

2837
02:03:56,750 --> 02:03:59,870
Watch what happens.
You're holding your finger in the ass,

2838
02:03:59,871 --> 02:04:02,120
but dogs biting another dog.
That's what's happening.

2839
02:04:02,180 --> 02:04:03,230
Nothing.
They don't do shit.

2840
02:04:03,250 --> 02:04:05,480
They want each other.
I've always read that.

2841
02:04:05,481 --> 02:04:10,481
If you stick your finger up,
a dogs ass instantly stopped what it's 

2842
02:04:10,481 --> 02:04:13,090
doing.
If you've got a bitch ass dog that 

2843
02:04:13,090 --> 02:04:15,191
doesn't have to help drive it ain't the 
dog and you.

2844
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:18,080
There are certain dogs that are going to
hang on.

2845
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:23,200
They're just going to hang on and you.
You can pick holes in the presence of 

2846
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:23,510
mind to be like,
I know your fingers in my ass,

2847
02:04:23,511 --> 02:04:26,030
but biting this other dog is the most 
important thing in the world.

2848
02:04:26,031 --> 02:04:27,880
They're driven because you want to pick 
it.

2849
02:04:27,881 --> 02:04:30,920
They're very driven.
Your cat may want to kill you.

2850
02:04:30,950 --> 02:04:35,950
Study says that in a heartbeat.
I believe that they would absolutely 

2851
02:04:35,950 --> 02:04:37,950
kill you if you are big enough or if 
they're big enough.

2852
02:04:37,950 --> 02:04:39,900
Rather,
look at the photo that she was doing.

2853
02:04:39,901 --> 02:04:42,510
One hundred percent would kill you if 
they could as the joker of cats.

2854
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:43,200
What?
The cat?

2855
02:04:43,230 --> 02:04:43,770
Yeah.
If you.

2856
02:04:43,830 --> 02:04:46,320
If you were the size of the cat and the 
cat was the size of you,

2857
02:04:46,321 --> 02:04:48,330
you'd be dead.
Honest percent.

2858
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:49,350
Yeah.
One hundred percent.

2859
02:04:49,380 --> 02:04:51,210
What have you were his friend from the 
beginning?

2860
02:04:51,680 --> 02:04:56,680
They don't have friends like that.
Like if I have a joke in my act about 

2861
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:59,631
how you could have a dog and have a pet 
hamster and that hamster could live a 

2862
02:04:59,631 --> 02:05:01,930
long and healthy life in the same house 
running around.

2863
02:05:02,030 --> 02:05:04,050
If you've got a good dog and you train 
that dog,

2864
02:05:04,260 --> 02:05:07,380
if you got a cat that lives in a house 
with a hamster on the hamster,

2865
02:05:07,381 --> 02:05:11,310
has an hour to live.
If it's lucky,

2866
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:16,760
there's no such thing as a cat at.
Also has a pet hamster that's a dead 

2867
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:16,760
animal.

2868
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:17,820
Next to that cat.
They kill everything.

2869
02:05:17,970 --> 02:05:20,670
Everything they can,
canaries lizards,

2870
02:05:20,730 --> 02:05:23,430
whatever the fuck you leave around that 
they can kill.

2871
02:05:23,431 --> 02:05:24,960
That's what they like to do.
Like to kill Shit.

2872
02:05:24,990 --> 02:05:26,720
Why do we have this relationship with 
them then?

2873
02:05:26,730 --> 02:05:30,210
Because they are small and like bitches,
where the bitches to the cats,

2874
02:05:30,390 --> 02:05:32,400
we feed them.
We give them free massages.

2875
02:05:32,401 --> 02:05:35,320
They don't do anything for us.
All they do is curl up to you and go and

2876
02:05:35,350 --> 02:05:38,030
willing you to touch me and you are 
going to do a view to.

2877
02:05:38,260 --> 02:05:40,340
He didn't say he loves you.
If you die,

2878
02:05:40,341 --> 02:05:42,030
the first thing that happens to you when
he dies,

2879
02:05:42,031 --> 02:05:43,680
the cats eat your face.
Is that true?

2880
02:05:43,690 --> 02:05:44,280
Yeah.
They get hungry.

2881
02:05:44,281 --> 02:05:46,370
They start eating your lips if they 
can't get to anything.

2882
02:05:46,380 --> 02:05:48,210
Yeah.
People that find dead bodies.

2883
02:05:48,240 --> 02:05:53,240
What does the sun nearly killed by a 
stray cat left covered in blood because 

2884
02:05:53,240 --> 02:05:54,670
cats are mean and all an honest.

2885
02:05:54,670 --> 02:05:56,430
I thought.
Wait a second.

2886
02:05:56,490 --> 02:05:57,870
Wait.
Go back to what we said before.

2887
02:05:57,880 --> 02:06:00,590
We've read that.
Um.

2888
02:06:00,780 --> 02:06:01,710
Which part?
I don't know.

2889
02:06:01,711 --> 02:06:04,470
The thing you just said it was shocking.
Yeah,

2890
02:06:04,471 --> 02:06:08,730
you totally took my head out the game.
But it was about the fuck,

2891
02:06:08,820 --> 02:06:11,850
it was just about the dogs.
The cow,

2892
02:06:11,980 --> 02:06:14,580
the cat was as big as me.
The cat would get 100 percent.

2893
02:06:14,820 --> 02:06:16,760
You have a cat was.
But what about a dog?

2894
02:06:16,761 --> 02:06:20,040
If a dog was as big as dogs can be giant
and still be your friend.

2895
02:06:20,220 --> 02:06:25,220
That's why a woman could be like 90 
pounds and have a 200 pound mastiff and 

2896
02:06:25,220 --> 02:06:29,541
that dog will totally listened to her.
She raised that door from the time it 

2897
02:06:29,541 --> 02:06:32,691
was a puppy and she can ride it like 
Khaleesi Roger Track it if she wanted 

2898
02:06:32,691 --> 02:06:32,691
to.
Totally.

2899
02:06:32,691 --> 02:06:35,040
But that doctor listened to her.
If you have a cat that big,

2900
02:06:35,220 --> 02:06:40,220
like you better hope that that cat just 
decides to not kill you because one day 

2901
02:06:40,220 --> 02:06:42,090
it might just get bored and they're not 
planning ahead.

2902
02:06:42,290 --> 02:06:44,220
You know,
they're not like investment bankers.

2903
02:06:44,460 --> 02:06:46,260
They just don't like the way you're 
moving one day,

2904
02:06:46,261 --> 02:06:48,570
just jump on you and just fuck you up 
and kill you.

2905
02:06:48,660 --> 02:06:51,480
It's true.
I've been hit by cats like,

2906
02:06:51,540 --> 02:06:53,820
not like in the face,
but like you're sitting there and all of

2907
02:06:53,821 --> 02:06:54,890
a sudden they're like,
yeah,

2908
02:06:55,070 --> 02:06:55,630
no.
Good reason,

2909
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:58,380
so if you were,
if that cat was eight times its size,

2910
02:06:58,620 --> 02:07:00,420
did you see that video of the guy who 
was a,

2911
02:07:00,421 --> 02:07:05,421
a long time animal trainer and he 
trained Lyons and he trained this line 

2912
02:07:05,421 --> 02:07:09,060
for like 10 years and he's in the pen 
with the thing and the thing just looked

2913
02:07:09,061 --> 02:07:10,860
at him funny and the guy starts backing 
up.

2914
02:07:10,861 --> 02:07:11,430
It's like,
oh no,

2915
02:07:11,431 --> 02:07:15,750
when he runs and this line just chases 
after this motherfucker grabs him by the

2916
02:07:15,751 --> 02:07:19,560
head and drags him around and apparently
he survived the lion,

2917
02:07:19,561 --> 02:07:24,561
let them go and somehow know that they 
got the line away from him and got the 

2918
02:07:24,561 --> 02:07:24,630
guy to a hospital.
But he was an older guy,

2919
02:07:24,810 --> 02:07:29,810
I want to say he was deep into his 
sixties and his line was dragging him 

2920
02:07:29,810 --> 02:07:33,501
around by his fucking head.
And this is a line that he had trained 

2921
02:07:33,501 --> 02:07:33,501
in that.
What happened to,

2922
02:07:33,501 --> 02:07:33,630
um,
what's her name?

2923
02:07:33,690 --> 02:07:35,700
Melanie Griffith.
Like her mom Tippi

2924
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:39,160
hedren was into old animals.
Lions.

2925
02:07:39,190 --> 02:07:40,940
Yeah.
And I think Melanie Griffith Gut,

2926
02:07:41,880 --> 02:07:42,180
uh,

2927
02:07:42,570 --> 02:07:46,800
bit or scratched as a child in her early
teens or something like that.

2928
02:07:47,190 --> 02:07:50,130
She had to have a facial reconstructive 
surgery.

2929
02:07:50,720 --> 02:07:52,280
I believe so.
Whoa.

2930
02:07:52,281 --> 02:07:54,270
I never heard.
There's a movie that they shot.

2931
02:07:54,680 --> 02:07:56,160
They shot,
I forget the name of the movie,

2932
02:07:56,161 --> 02:08:01,161
but they shot the movie of them 
interacting with the documentary about 

2933
02:08:01,161 --> 02:08:01,470
them living with big cat.

2934
02:08:01,780 --> 02:08:03,100
Yeah.
When you watch the video online,

2935
02:08:03,101 --> 02:08:04,300
it doesn't even look real.
Like,

2936
02:08:04,301 --> 02:08:04,900
wait a minute,
wait a minute,

2937
02:08:04,901 --> 02:08:05,830
wait a minute.
Is that real?

2938
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:08,440
That's really Melanie Griffin with lions
and tigers and shit.

2939
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:10,150
How many different cats that they have?

2940
02:08:13,130 --> 02:08:14,240
There was a lot,
right?

2941
02:08:14,720 --> 02:08:19,720
I want to say there was five,
so the kind of thing you just asked 

2942
02:08:19,720 --> 02:08:20,930
people get my cats.
I'm a big kid and the Griffin said,

2943
02:08:21,200 --> 02:08:22,880
looking at the article right now,
he's a wizard with that.

2944
02:08:22,881 --> 02:08:25,100
Google will pull it up so we could see 
the photos.

2945
02:08:25,790 --> 02:08:27,440
It's so preposterous.
Look at that.

2946
02:08:27,740 --> 02:08:29,660
That's crazy.
That's crazy.

2947
02:08:30,070 --> 02:08:31,600
It's crazy.
She's fun.

2948
02:08:31,610 --> 02:08:33,590
That looks.
It shouldn't that be the way life is.

2949
02:08:33,650 --> 02:08:36,440
You imagine if you were a burglar and 
you broke into that fucking house.

2950
02:08:37,250 --> 02:08:39,080
Holy Shit.
What a mistake.

2951
02:08:39,520 --> 02:08:44,520
I imagine you break into a house and you
see a 600 pound African male lion just 

2952
02:08:44,601 --> 02:08:46,940
looking at you with that gigantic head 
of death.

2953
02:08:47,600 --> 02:08:48,620
Fuck man.

2954
02:08:48,630 --> 02:08:53,250
The bizarre tale of Melanie Griffith and
her pet lion did they talk about the

2955
02:08:53,770 --> 02:08:58,770
attack,
but look at her spitting water into the 

2956
02:08:58,981 --> 02:09:00,840
big cats.
No one in the family was ever injured by

2957
02:09:00,841 --> 02:09:03,690
the lion.
No one will buy that line by that one.

2958
02:09:03,860 --> 02:09:07,560
Oh my neil.
But Neil certainly could have killed any

2959
02:09:07,561 --> 02:09:11,070
of them at a moments notice.
At one point he did attack Ron Oxley,

2960
02:09:11,071 --> 02:09:13,380
his owner during a dinner party at his 
home.

2961
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:15,390
Fuck all of that.

2962
02:09:15,610 --> 02:09:18,310
After Neil,
the family went on to adopt numerous big

2963
02:09:18,311 --> 02:09:20,860
cats,
but it's resulted in a series of serious

2964
02:09:20,861 --> 02:09:23,260
injuries.
Fifty seven years old,

2965
02:09:23,261 --> 02:09:26,680
melanie has learned from the experience 
and runs a sanctuary.

2966
02:09:27,910 --> 02:09:30,700
She finds a sanctuary for 32 big cats.
Oh my God.

2967
02:09:30,701 --> 02:09:34,390
Look at that thing on the desk.
That is so insane.

2968
02:09:34,750 --> 02:09:37,180
First of all,
does that thing need exercise?

2969
02:09:37,181 --> 02:09:39,780
Just to keep it shit together?
Look at the size of that fucker.

2970
02:09:39,790 --> 02:09:41,330
How much you think you got to feed that 
guy?

2971
02:09:41,380 --> 02:09:43,360
A lot dude.
And only meat.

2972
02:09:43,860 --> 02:09:45,700
They are obligate carnivores,

2973
02:09:46,720 --> 02:09:51,720
you know,
they're not like a dog looking at how 

2974
02:09:51,720 --> 02:09:51,720
tall he is in the fridge.
Huge animal man.

2975
02:09:51,720 --> 02:09:53,750
And that's the point where I'm like,
I'm not working here anymore.

2976
02:09:53,780 --> 02:09:58,780
It's just laying around their house.
Look at the fucking muscles on that 

2977
02:09:58,780 --> 02:09:59,930
thing.
And do you think they're like cats?

2978
02:09:59,960 --> 02:10:02,000
Like will they only shit where they're 
supposed to?

2979
02:10:02,001 --> 02:10:04,690
Shit a.
That shit's wants.

2980
02:10:04,760 --> 02:10:05,030
Yeah.

2981
02:10:05,130 --> 02:10:08,820
The thing about the size of this cat,
I mean this is crazy.

2982
02:10:09,090 --> 02:10:11,250
It's so big.
It's.

2983
02:10:11,280 --> 02:10:16,280
It must be a thrill to be around 
something that could just kill you at 

2984
02:10:16,280 --> 02:10:19,611
any moment.
And apparently lions in particular are 

2985
02:10:19,611 --> 02:10:20,820
pretty cool with people.
Yeah.

2986
02:10:20,821 --> 02:10:25,821
That's nuts.
They're playing the lion hazard by the 

2987
02:10:25,821 --> 02:10:28,281
leg.
She's jumping into the pool and some 

2988
02:10:28,281 --> 02:10:28,281
fake biting her.
Fuck all of that.

2989
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:32,220
Everything about that picture.
Put that on a tee shirt with those words

2990
02:10:33,350 --> 02:10:34,520
at her.
They were friends,

2991
02:10:34,520 --> 02:10:36,050
dude.
They were buddies at a young.

2992
02:10:36,051 --> 02:10:37,070
She looked,
she looks,

2993
02:10:37,130 --> 02:10:39,410
she's a kid.
She's in her teens at this point.

2994
02:10:39,411 --> 02:10:39,840
She has a

2995
02:10:39,900 --> 02:10:44,010
giant line in our yard.
Go find the cooler.

2996
02:10:44,011 --> 02:10:47,610
Was there apparently than tigers.
Tigers are a little sketchier.

2997
02:10:48,280 --> 02:10:53,280
There's a little sketchier,
so like you'd have an easier time Tony 

2998
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:53,930
Alliance.
Then we would have done that.

2999
02:10:54,060 --> 02:10:54,870
I.
This is.

3000
02:10:54,930 --> 02:10:59,930
I'm talking way out of school,
but what I believe is the case is that 

3001
02:10:59,930 --> 02:11:03,030
male lions are mostly there to protect 
the pride.

3002
02:11:03,420 --> 02:11:06,240
They're mostly there,
so they're not the hundreds right there.

3003
02:11:06,241 --> 02:11:08,400
The bigger ones,
the females do all the hunting.

3004
02:11:08,430 --> 02:11:12,150
What are the size of that female.
Oh my God.

3005
02:11:12,240 --> 02:11:14,970
What's going on there in the movie?
It's attacking her in the movie.

3006
02:11:14,971 --> 02:11:15,660
Yeah,
that's what I mean.

3007
02:11:15,661 --> 02:11:18,180
That's what the link was.
This close call below.

3008
02:11:21,530 --> 02:11:24,920
So it's biting her.
It's got her mouth around the ribs.

3009
02:11:24,950 --> 02:11:27,500
Is it actually hurting her?
She doesn't look happy.

3010
02:11:29,620 --> 02:11:31,050
I'm not showing it.
Oh,

3011
02:11:31,090 --> 02:11:32,650
this is crazy.
All right.

3012
02:11:32,830 --> 02:11:34,660
This is fucked up.
So this was in the movie.

3013
02:11:34,661 --> 02:11:36,820
They were freaking out to the line was 
biting somebody.

3014
02:11:37,260 --> 02:11:39,010
It says the father refused to yell.
Cut.

3015
02:11:39,760 --> 02:11:43,360
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

3016
02:11:43,420 --> 02:11:45,250
No.
Blood was drawn and the lion grabbed her

3017
02:11:45,251 --> 02:11:48,070
hair and pulled her back.
So the line was just fucking with her.

3018
02:11:48,130 --> 02:11:50,830
But he is dangerous.
He was once Claude,

3019
02:11:50,870 --> 02:11:55,870
the face during that filming that 
required required reconstructive 

3020
02:11:55,870 --> 02:11:55,870
surgery.

3021
02:11:55,870 --> 02:11:56,210
Ge Story that I'd heard it.
She was clogged

3022
02:11:57,500 --> 02:12:02,500
more responsible and you know,
there's several lines in this house and 

3023
02:12:02,500 --> 02:12:04,200
it's not just one.
So the lions who's there,

3024
02:12:04,690 --> 02:12:06,200
the lines are just running shit.

3025
02:12:06,700 --> 02:12:11,700
And I think they picked them and they,
they were lines that came from like 

3026
02:12:11,700 --> 02:12:11,700
surfaces and shit.

3027
02:12:11,700 --> 02:12:15,560
$17,000,000
on the movie and it brought back to a 

3028
02:12:15,560 --> 02:12:15,560
bargain.
Roar.

3029
02:12:15,560 --> 02:12:15,560
Yeah.

3030
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:19,040
After this podcast,
get ready for another 50 bucks.

3031
02:12:19,370 --> 02:12:21,800
And that's 17.
How much?

3032
02:12:21,810 --> 02:12:24,100
Nineteen 71.
$17.

3033
02:12:24,101 --> 02:12:26,410
Million dollars in 1971.
Yeah.

3034
02:12:26,470 --> 02:12:28,010
This is a nice way to learn to cocaine 
money,

3035
02:12:28,011 --> 02:12:29,290
son.
That's what's going on there.

3036
02:12:29,380 --> 02:12:30,700
What is that today?
Like $80.

3037
02:12:30,701 --> 02:12:32,000
Million Dollars.
Billion.

3038
02:12:32,030 --> 02:12:32,390
Trillion.

3039
02:12:34,250 --> 02:12:37,720
The what I was saying was,
I think what happens is that lions,

3040
02:12:37,721 --> 02:12:42,721
the male lions don't hunt.
They usually just eat the kill that the 

3041
02:12:42,721 --> 02:12:43,180
female lions hunt.
They,

3042
02:12:43,190 --> 02:12:45,160
they're doing all the hunting.
But with tigers,

3043
02:12:45,161 --> 02:12:47,980
the male lions hunt,
like they're all hunt and they don't,

3044
02:12:48,070 --> 02:12:50,110
they don't operate in packs,
you know,

3045
02:12:50,120 --> 02:12:52,300
they're not independent than rogue.
Yeah,

3046
02:12:52,301 --> 02:12:53,200
they're not,
they don't.

3047
02:12:53,230 --> 02:12:56,170
They don't operate the same way.
Lions who don't have a pride,

3048
02:12:56,440 --> 02:12:57,120
you know,
I'll take.

3049
02:12:57,160 --> 02:12:59,440
I think tigers are pretty much on their 
own know.

3050
02:12:59,640 --> 02:13:01,870
I think the females take care of the 
cubs as long as they can,

3051
02:13:01,871 --> 02:13:05,530
but I don't think they have these big.
I could be wrong,

3052
02:13:05,550 --> 02:13:10,550
find out if I'm wrong,
but I don't think tigers operate in 

3053
02:13:10,550 --> 02:13:11,470
like,
like that kind of a group

3054
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:17,560
in a world where like I've got a 
miniature doctrine that means that 

3055
02:13:17,560 --> 02:13:17,560
somebody's genetically made that dog 
smaller.

3056
02:13:17,560 --> 02:13:18,710
Right.
Well,

3057
02:13:18,711 --> 02:13:21,890
when you say genetically they're not 
doing it through a laboratory,

3058
02:13:21,891 --> 02:13:25,850
they're doing it through selective 
breeding and it's remarkably effective.

3059
02:13:25,910 --> 02:13:28,520
And then you do that.
I just needed that to get to this point.

3060
02:13:28,521 --> 02:13:31,080
Can you do that with a tiger baby tiger?
Yeah.

3061
02:13:31,150 --> 02:13:32,070
So could you.
That's

3062
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:37,070
what happened.
All house cats have come from some kind 

3063
02:13:37,070 --> 02:13:39,390
of wild cat that we turned into a 
domestic cat.

3064
02:13:39,510 --> 02:13:42,210
And there's a bunch of different 
varieties of cats,

3065
02:13:42,390 --> 02:13:47,390
right?
The difference between cats and dogs is 

3066
02:13:47,390 --> 02:13:48,030
that all dogs come from wolves,
all of them.

3067
02:13:48,230 --> 02:13:49,320
Everyone,
every dog,

3068
02:13:49,380 --> 02:13:54,380
every dog started as a wolf.
Tigers did not live in permanent groups 

3069
02:13:54,380 --> 02:13:57,711
like lions do for the most part.
They live solitary lives except when 

3070
02:13:57,711 --> 02:14:00,711
females are raising cubs.
Although rarely seen the term for a 

3071
02:14:00,711 --> 02:14:02,490
group of tigers is a streak.
Dope word.

3072
02:14:03,300 --> 02:14:04,890
Tigers.
Murder of crows.

3073
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:05,570
That's pretty.
Um,

3074
02:14:05,880 --> 02:14:08,250
that's dope.
Um,

3075
02:14:08,450 --> 02:14:13,450
my mom used to come here when I was a 
kid and now I can tell her mom if there 

3076
02:14:13,450 --> 02:14:13,770
was another one,
we'd be a streak of tigers.

3077
02:14:13,890 --> 02:14:15,000
Tigers.
Fuck things up,

3078
02:14:15,001 --> 02:14:16,410
man.
They all fuck things up.

3079
02:14:16,411 --> 02:14:19,170
All the males hunt and they're,
they're fast.

3080
02:14:19,180 --> 02:14:21,630
Fuck an animal man.
Oh,

3081
02:14:21,720 --> 02:14:22,090
is this?

3082
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:23,500
It will be.
It's on youtube.

3083
02:14:23,560 --> 02:14:25,630
He got fucked up.
Also roars.

3084
02:14:25,820 --> 02:14:27,130
Roar.
This is the whole movie.

3085
02:14:27,131 --> 02:14:27,920
It's on youtube.
If you go,

3086
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:32,960
oh,
I just randomly click to a spot where 

3087
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:35,641
they happen to be attacked.
And the movie is about how they have 

3088
02:14:35,641 --> 02:14:37,380
these big,
what the fuck seems like I couldn't seen

3089
02:14:37,390 --> 02:14:42,390
movie.
It's called the most dangerous movie 

3090
02:14:42,390 --> 02:14:42,390
ever made.
Oh my God,

3091
02:14:42,390 --> 02:14:44,911
this guy's an idiot.
And when you say they said Jesus father 

3092
02:14:44,911 --> 02:14:44,911
didn't yell.
Cut.

3093
02:14:44,911 --> 02:14:46,500
That was Melanie Griffith.
His Dad was directed.

3094
02:14:46,770 --> 02:14:47,550
Dude,
this is crazy.

3095
02:14:47,551 --> 02:14:51,000
They're all these lines are fighting for
dominance and this guy is running around

3096
02:14:51,030 --> 02:14:53,580
in between them while they're filming a 
shitty movie.

3097
02:14:55,770 --> 02:14:57,600
Crazy hook it.
It's like,

3098
02:14:57,601 --> 02:15:00,190
fuck you bitch stabbed on my business.
Oh my God.

3099
02:15:00,830 --> 02:15:04,100
The lions just wanted him to know that 
that little tree branch was not going to

3100
02:15:04,101 --> 02:15:09,101
stop them.
Jesus crisis because it cut each other 

3101
02:15:09,101 --> 02:15:09,420
up,
man.

3102
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:11,670
They're biting each other fucking each 
other up.

3103
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:13,860
It's what they do,
man.

3104
02:15:14,330 --> 02:15:18,890
And this was a movie that was meant to 
show how stupid the guy.

3105
02:15:18,980 --> 02:15:23,540
The roar is in 1981 American adventure 
exploitation film.

3106
02:15:23,990 --> 02:15:27,620
Written and directed by no Marshall 
producing starring Marshall and his then

3107
02:15:27,621 --> 02:15:32,621
wife,
tiffany Hendra and costarring hundreds 

3108
02:15:32,621 --> 02:15:32,990
real life daughter Melanie Griffith and 
Marshall's real life sons.

3109
02:15:32,991 --> 02:15:34,000
John and Jerry.
Oh,

3110
02:15:34,001 --> 02:15:39,001
they were brady bunch type family.
The film follows a family who are 

3111
02:15:39,001 --> 02:15:42,641
attacked by a range of ravening jungle 
animals at the secluded home of their 

3112
02:15:43,251 --> 02:15:45,020
keyboard.
I always thought this was a documentary.

3113
02:15:45,021 --> 02:15:50,021
They were literally making a movie with 
fucking real lions about how lions were 

3114
02:15:50,421 --> 02:15:51,140
attacking people.

3115
02:15:51,780 --> 02:15:56,780
70 members of its cast and crew being 
injured by the many predatory animals 

3116
02:15:57,781 --> 02:16:00,000
used in the film,
including its main stars,

3117
02:16:00,240 --> 02:16:05,240
sustaining life threatening injuries,
rating from bone fractures to scalping 

3118
02:16:05,240 --> 02:16:09,261
and gangrene.
Much of the footage capturing the 

3119
02:16:09,261 --> 02:16:10,260
injuries was included in the final cut 
of the film,

3120
02:16:10,261 --> 02:16:15,261
resulting in real blood on screen.
It has been considered the most 

3121
02:16:15,261 --> 02:16:17,760
dangerous film shoot in history.
Wow,

3122
02:16:18,350 --> 02:16:21,720
okay.
We need to do a fight companion.

3123
02:16:21,780 --> 02:16:23,760
They had tigers as well.
Oh my God.

3124
02:16:23,761 --> 02:16:28,200
They had leopards or jaguars.
Were those Jaguars and leopards?

3125
02:16:28,201 --> 02:16:29,770
Do you know the difference to look at 
the tiger?

3126
02:16:29,771 --> 02:16:31,570
They just look at it for part of the 
world,

3127
02:16:31,571 --> 02:16:33,070
but he just.
He just jumped in the boat.

3128
02:16:33,220 --> 02:16:34,330
Yeah.
Congratulations.

3129
02:16:34,350 --> 02:16:39,350
Thanks.
They hit him in the fucking face while 

3130
02:16:39,350 --> 02:16:41,820
they have to.
I think you have to get it to think 

3131
02:16:41,820 --> 02:16:41,820
who's boss?
Is that a pan?

3132
02:16:41,820 --> 02:16:43,480
Of course it is.
Fuck all this.

3133
02:16:45,740 --> 02:16:47,680
The tiger,
and then now the boat's sinking.

3134
02:16:47,681 --> 02:16:49,450
You fuck you.
Fuck it.

3135
02:16:49,470 --> 02:16:51,040
Fuck.
This is life of Pi.

3136
02:16:51,160 --> 02:16:52,540
Oh my God.
Look at that thing.

3137
02:16:52,541 --> 02:16:53,590
It's so big,
right?

3138
02:16:53,620 --> 02:16:55,130
We're going to save it for the computer.
Oh,

3139
02:16:55,570 --> 02:17:00,570
Jesus.
So what we'll do is one day we'll do a 

3140
02:17:00,570 --> 02:17:00,850
fight companion.
Put that movie.

3141
02:17:01,380 --> 02:17:03,790
Like save it.
Yeah,

3142
02:17:03,850 --> 02:17:06,100
we'll do this week we're doing roar.
Yeah,

3143
02:17:06,101 --> 02:17:08,200
we'll do roar.
Got In trouble for that.

3144
02:17:08,260 --> 02:17:10,100
Can we get in trouble for a fight 
companion for Ra?

3145
02:17:10,350 --> 02:17:11,780
People that did things like this?
Yeah.

3146
02:17:11,781 --> 02:17:12,420
No,
totally.

3147
02:17:12,430 --> 02:17:13,560
It's a.
What is it considered?

3148
02:17:13,561 --> 02:17:16,660
It's commentary here from rattling.
It needs to be seen.

3149
02:17:16,750 --> 02:17:19,210
That needs to be heard.
I'm completely educated.

3150
02:17:19,211 --> 02:17:21,370
I thought it was documented,
but they're actually make.

3151
02:17:21,371 --> 02:17:23,650
They were trying to make a fix of 
narrative of pictionary.

3152
02:17:23,651 --> 02:17:25,090
I didn't even know there was a 
documentary.

3153
02:17:25,091 --> 02:17:30,091
I just knew that she had lived with 
lions and I'd seen it in a magazine 

3154
02:17:30,091 --> 02:17:30,230
article or something or my real dad 
that's.

3155
02:17:30,230 --> 02:17:32,470
Or stepdad.
Stepdad was fucking crazy.

3156
02:17:33,100 --> 02:17:36,250
Could you imagine your Stepdad's Jamie?
Get in there with the lion.

3157
02:17:36,460 --> 02:17:38,230
Would you put that evil on me,
Jamie?

3158
02:17:38,920 --> 02:17:40,370
Oh my God,
what is it?

3159
02:17:40,380 --> 02:17:45,380
The movie?
Look at all the cats in the room with 

3160
02:17:45,380 --> 02:17:47,380
her.
Don't many fuck all that.

3161
02:17:48,250 --> 02:17:53,250
Fuck all that.
And they were crazy and I'm sure the 

3162
02:17:53,250 --> 02:17:54,580
cats are like confused as fuck by the 
rolling cameras as well.

3163
02:17:54,910 --> 02:17:56,110
Being like,
what is this all about?

3164
02:17:56,560 --> 02:17:57,520
Yeah,
they're horrible.

3165
02:17:58,270 --> 02:18:03,270
It's.
I mean those are the cleanup crew for 

3166
02:18:03,270 --> 02:18:03,270
the world.
That's what cats are there out there and

3167
02:18:03,270 --> 02:18:08,091
taken out as as many of those fucking 
zebras or water buffalo or whatever 

3168
02:18:08,091 --> 02:18:12,120
where they can and so that's what they 
want to do all the time and if you're 

3169
02:18:12,120 --> 02:18:13,090
just feeding them and then you just have
many yard,

3170
02:18:13,091 --> 02:18:16,810
they don't even do anything.
Like you got to exercise the fuck out of

3171
02:18:16,811 --> 02:18:20,530
those girls to keep them from just that 
kills lust.

3172
02:18:20,680 --> 02:18:25,680
That's in their body.
They evolved over millions of years to 

3173
02:18:25,680 --> 02:18:27,610
get to this point where there's this 
enormous,

3174
02:18:27,700 --> 02:18:32,700
hulking,
super naturally powerful animal that 

3175
02:18:32,700 --> 02:18:34,120
kills things with its face and you just 
take that away from them.

3176
02:18:34,260 --> 02:18:36,460
It's new.
You're going to be in the pool with us.

3177
02:18:36,760 --> 02:18:41,050
You're going to be in our movie.
We're going to start off in this boat.

3178
02:18:41,080 --> 02:18:42,160
Come on,
hop in the boat.

3179
02:18:42,270 --> 02:18:43,510
Pretend to fight.
And the liquid.

3180
02:18:43,700 --> 02:18:48,700
Pretend I'm Mrs.
It's like when the fuck do the antelope 

3181
02:18:48,700 --> 02:18:50,380
show up so I could start jacking fools.
Would you.

3182
02:18:51,880 --> 02:18:56,880
You're.
Would you agree that since you do more 

3183
02:18:56,880 --> 02:18:57,340
outdoors,
the activity that may I running it,

3184
02:18:57,460 --> 02:19:02,460
you've gone hunting and stuff like that.
Your chances of being eaten alive are 

3185
02:19:02,500 --> 02:19:04,600
far greater than mine.
Oh yeah,

3186
02:19:04,630 --> 02:19:07,060
100 percent.
I mean it's like surfers.

3187
02:19:07,510 --> 02:19:11,980
I'm in a zero percent chance in most of 
my life of getting eaten by a shark,

3188
02:19:12,400 --> 02:19:17,400
but I have friends who are surfers who 
surf all the time and they fucking love 

3189
02:19:17,400 --> 02:19:21,091
it and they're willing to roll that dice
because they like surfing that much and 

3190
02:19:21,091 --> 02:19:21,091
I'm like,
you know,

3191
02:19:21,091 --> 02:19:22,030
you can't get bit by a shark if you 
don't go in the ocean.

3192
02:19:22,540 --> 02:19:27,540
And they're like,
we've got this shark thing figured out 

3193
02:19:27,540 --> 02:19:27,540
and defeated.
Just don't go in the ocean.

3194
02:19:27,540 --> 02:19:27,890
They say it's worth it.

3195
02:19:28,370 --> 02:19:29,930
I got to tell you,
man,

3196
02:19:29,931 --> 02:19:34,931
like there's a bunch of bad ways to die,
but I always felt like the most 

3197
02:19:35,541 --> 02:19:40,220
indignity I would ever feel in death was
if I was something else's food.

3198
02:19:40,460 --> 02:19:44,390
It's one thing if I'm like my body goes 
into the earth and fucking the worms and

3199
02:19:44,391 --> 02:19:49,391
the grass and shit like that,
but to be someone's fucking meal is so 

3200
02:19:50,060 --> 02:19:54,410
it's a temporary or a permanent solution
to a temporary problem,

3201
02:19:54,440 --> 02:19:59,440
your life for their meal of the moment 
and they're just going to shoot you out 

3202
02:20:00,170 --> 02:20:05,170
in a couple of hours.
And that's why I think it's hard for 

3203
02:20:05,170 --> 02:20:05,170
humans get their head around being 
eating my son because like,

3204
02:20:05,170 --> 02:20:10,030
no,
I'm too special and then they'll just 

3205
02:20:10,030 --> 02:20:12,191
going to poop me out.
But that would be the indignity man is 

3206
02:20:12,191 --> 02:20:12,191
like,
fuck,

3207
02:20:12,191 --> 02:20:15,551
they ate me to stay alive I guess.
But then it's not like I sustained them 

3208
02:20:15,551 --> 02:20:20,321
forever.
Like I sustained him for a couple of 

3209
02:20:20,321 --> 02:20:20,321
fucking hours and they shipped me out,
you know?

3210
02:20:20,321 --> 02:20:21,400
Well that,
that is how it works.

3211
02:20:21,401 --> 02:20:22,050
Right?
Yeah.

3212
02:20:22,410 --> 02:20:23,920
Um,
it's very disturbing.

3213
02:20:23,921 --> 02:20:26,680
Seeing images of humans that have been 
eaten by animals.

3214
02:20:26,710 --> 02:20:31,710
I've never seen any and I don't want to.
You don't want any finger starting to 

3215
02:20:31,710 --> 02:20:31,900
move toward a gay boy,
but like,

3216
02:20:31,930 --> 02:20:32,110
no,
no,

3217
02:20:32,111 --> 02:20:37,111
no.
Classic one of a body that they found 

3218
02:20:37,111 --> 02:20:39,691
that bears at eaten and I was horrific.
It's just crazy to look at is even make 

3219
02:20:40,850 --> 02:20:42,250
human anymore.
I mean,

3220
02:20:42,251 --> 02:20:47,251
you know what it is because it was still
wearing sneakers and it's still at heck 

3221
02:20:47,251 --> 02:20:48,820
half of its pants on and it's still 
like,

3222
02:20:48,910 --> 02:20:49,900
you know the one.
Yeah,

3223
02:20:50,080 --> 02:20:52,370
you could see the thigh bone.
I mean the,

3224
02:20:52,371 --> 02:20:57,371
the meat from the bone had been 
completely stripped off and it was just 

3225
02:20:57,371 --> 02:21:00,400
nothing but the thigh bone and it's just
horrific.

3226
02:21:00,520 --> 02:21:05,110
You gotta realize like those things man,
when they get ahold of you,

3227
02:21:05,140 --> 02:21:10,140
the amount of like,
the amount of power that a bear could 

3228
02:21:10,140 --> 02:21:10,140
generate,
like especially at grizzly bear.

3229
02:21:10,140 --> 02:21:14,770
My friend John saw a grizzly bear kill a
moose by swatting it,

3230
02:21:15,070 --> 02:21:19,300
swatted it with its pot and broke.
It's back a moose.

3231
02:21:20,400 --> 02:21:22,900
I mean,
second deadliest animal on the planet is

3232
02:21:22,901 --> 02:21:26,080
a big.
Is it really that crazy?

3233
02:21:26,081 --> 02:21:28,590
Nobody thinks about it because when you 
think about the logo,

3234
02:21:28,640 --> 02:21:33,640
a rookie be hippo is the most dangerous 
animal to man on the planet in terms of 

3235
02:21:34,241 --> 02:21:37,060
like how many people get killed aml.
Second is the Moose.

3236
02:21:37,150 --> 02:21:39,130
Wow.
Part of the deer family.

3237
02:21:39,520 --> 02:21:41,550
That's crazy.
They're the only dear.

3238
02:21:41,570 --> 02:21:43,240
Really,
that will regularly rush.

3239
02:21:43,241 --> 02:21:47,040
People don't want to be anywhere near 
the Moose during the reading season.

3240
02:21:47,290 --> 02:21:49,960
There's that,
but really more importantly is you don't

3241
02:21:49,961 --> 02:21:52,750
want to be near a cow.
She's got her calves.

3242
02:21:52,770 --> 02:21:56,020
That's video that online.
Same thing with grizzlies.

3243
02:21:56,770 --> 02:21:57,940
Yeah.
They say the real.

3244
02:21:58,180 --> 02:22:00,460
The real fear is not running into a male
grizzly.

3245
02:22:00,460 --> 02:22:03,010
The real fear is running to a female 
with cubs,

3246
02:22:03,060 --> 02:22:04,980
which they'll to lose.
Well,

3247
02:22:04,990 --> 02:22:07,090
they just didn't want you around.
You might be a hunter.

3248
02:22:07,240 --> 02:22:10,300
Maybe they seen someone shoot an animal 
before.

3249
02:22:10,301 --> 02:22:15,301
Maybe they saw some.
One of their family gets to that little 

3250
02:22:15,301 --> 02:22:15,301
cat that just like,
shoot suddenly,

3251
02:22:15,301 --> 02:22:17,780
like you're gonna kill me up.
Even though you were buddies.

3252
02:22:18,020 --> 02:22:19,840
It has cubs.
If it has cubs,

3253
02:22:19,841 --> 02:22:20,390
man,
they're.

3254
02:22:20,391 --> 02:22:25,391
They're on fucking full red alert all 
day long because they get eaten all the 

3255
02:22:25,391 --> 02:22:27,790
time.
Their cubs get eaten by other bears too,

3256
02:22:27,820 --> 02:22:32,820
so fucking weird.
It's like an animal has enough sense to 

3257
02:22:32,820 --> 02:22:32,820
be like something to do here.
I'm going to protect my kids and we just

3258
02:22:32,820 --> 02:22:34,550
watched footage from a movie where the 
guy's like,

3259
02:22:34,590 --> 02:22:38,190
get closer to that lion honey.
Spit water in its mouth.

3260
02:22:38,220 --> 02:22:43,220
Yeah,
because we're soft and we love the 

3261
02:22:43,220 --> 02:22:43,220
thrill of being that close to death and 
danger.

3262
02:22:43,380 --> 02:22:46,680
I know you're a smart man now.
I'm a chicken man.

3263
02:22:47,340 --> 02:22:48,690
You're a wise man.
No courage.

3264
02:22:48,691 --> 02:22:51,510
I just want to extend my life.
That is not true.

3265
02:22:51,690 --> 02:22:56,690
You have courage.
You just choose to not put yourself in 

3266
02:22:56,690 --> 02:22:57,840
dangerous situations all the time.
He had never taken this path in life and

3267
02:22:57,841 --> 02:22:59,970
become this guy.
If you didn't have any courage,

3268
02:22:59,971 --> 02:23:04,971
you absolutely have courage,
but you just smart enough to know that 

3269
02:23:04,971 --> 02:23:05,570
you're not like a physical person.
You're not into.

3270
02:23:05,640 --> 02:23:10,640
You don't want to do those things.
He definitely don't want to be around 

3271
02:23:10,640 --> 02:23:10,710
some fucking giant ass cat.
I can kill you.

3272
02:23:10,920 --> 02:23:13,860
It's not a matter of being a coward.
It's a matter of being smart.

3273
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:18,920
It's true.
But if that's a matter of being smart 

3274
02:23:18,920 --> 02:23:19,290
now everything collapses and shit like 
that,

3275
02:23:19,320 --> 02:23:21,900
then I got no livable skill.
No one does.

3276
02:23:21,910 --> 02:23:25,590
Ready to fucking take to the hills with 
a fucking bow and defend yours,

3277
02:23:25,620 --> 02:23:26,370
just like you are.

3278
02:23:26,490 --> 02:23:28,470
How many hours do I have?
You know,

3279
02:23:28,471 --> 02:23:31,270
how long can I live with these arrows?
You know what?

3280
02:23:31,310 --> 02:23:34,440
What happens if I break that down to 20 
arrows?

3281
02:23:34,680 --> 02:23:35,730
How many?
How long can I live with?

3282
02:23:35,731 --> 02:23:40,731
20 arrows?
How many things am I going to miss to 

3283
02:23:40,731 --> 02:23:40,731
keep running?
You have to break into a Cabela's,

3284
02:23:40,731 --> 02:23:45,680
steal a bunch of Arrow shafts,
figured out they've got a gluing 

3285
02:23:45,680 --> 02:23:48,501
machine.
I got to learn how to restrain a bow 

3286
02:23:48,501 --> 02:23:48,501
with the.
What if the one of the risers snaps?

3287
02:23:48,501 --> 02:23:50,820
I gotta get some spare boast somehow and
have them laying around.

3288
02:23:51,180 --> 02:23:52,260
I'm not doing well,
man.

3289
02:23:52,261 --> 02:23:54,330
I'm going to be real skinny.
I'm going to miss a lot.

3290
02:23:54,331 --> 02:23:56,730
I'm not going to get enough food,
but you know it's going to happen.

3291
02:23:56,731 --> 02:23:58,710
You're going to be like,
at least I didn't die years ago.

3292
02:23:58,711 --> 02:24:02,630
Like Kev.
Oh cause he had no skills whatsoever.

3293
02:24:02,630 --> 02:24:05,480
I want to be one of the people that 
restart civilization lock.

3294
02:24:05,530 --> 02:24:06,860
No,
no.

3295
02:24:07,020 --> 02:24:09,390
Do you know there's blamed when 
everyone's like,

3296
02:24:09,391 --> 02:24:10,980
this sucks.
This is your fault.

3297
02:24:10,981 --> 02:24:13,260
You started civilization like,
like tried.

3298
02:24:13,320 --> 02:24:16,440
What's going on right now in Hawaii is 
fairly minor.

3299
02:24:16,470 --> 02:24:19,770
What is in terms of volcanic volcanic 
activity in terms of the world,

3300
02:24:19,800 --> 02:24:23,020
like there's.
There's giant events that happened every

3301
02:24:23,050 --> 02:24:25,170
know 100,000,
80,000,

3302
02:24:25,171 --> 02:24:28,050
whatever all over the world and the 
giant events.

3303
02:24:28,051 --> 02:24:33,051
These super volcanoes had been 
responsible for knocking people down to 

3304
02:24:33,051 --> 02:24:33,240
an estimated.
What was the number?

3305
02:24:33,241 --> 02:24:37,950
Something like seven thousand seven 
thousand people somewhere.

3306
02:24:38,150 --> 02:24:40,320
It was maybe a couple thousand,
70,000

3307
02:24:40,321 --> 02:24:42,050
years ago.
Is that where I'm getting the Fran seven

3308
02:24:42,150 --> 02:24:47,150
from a,
but it was a super volcano that the 

3309
02:24:47,150 --> 02:24:50,331
human population killed every one except
for a few thousand people and there was.

3310
02:24:51,480 --> 02:24:54,720
This was somewhere around,
I think it was 60 slash 70,000

3311
02:24:54,721 --> 02:24:56,460
years ago.
Was it?

3312
02:24:56,461 --> 02:25:00,840
Say I pompei like event 70,000
roughly a thousand reproductive people.

3313
02:25:01,110 --> 02:25:04,080
Thousand people left 70,000
years ago.

3314
02:25:04,170 --> 02:25:07,380
A thousand.
That was the last of the humans and they

3315
02:25:07,381 --> 02:25:11,430
repopulate it from that number to us.
One says it was as low as 40,

3316
02:25:11,610 --> 02:25:14,700
40 people.
Maybe it's just a rough estimate.

3317
02:25:14,730 --> 02:25:17,430
Biblical where this information.
Well listen man,

3318
02:25:17,431 --> 02:25:22,431
if yellow stone blows,
we're dealing with the exact same 

3319
02:25:22,431 --> 02:25:22,431
situation.
Again,

3320
02:25:22,431 --> 02:25:22,600
most of North America is dead.
What?

3321
02:25:22,690 --> 02:25:23,590
Expand?
What?

3322
02:25:23,740 --> 02:25:26,530
Yellow stone is a super volcano.
Wow.

3323
02:25:26,531 --> 02:25:31,531
Might've hit as low as what?
What happened to Harry went to JFK 

3324
02:25:31,531 --> 02:25:34,410
thing.
Conspiracies pairs

3325
02:25:34,410 --> 02:25:34,980
of people.
Well,

3326
02:25:34,981 --> 02:25:39,981
we've wax so we can win.
Once in our history of the worldwide 

3327
02:25:39,981 --> 02:25:42,000
population of human being skidded so 
sharply,

3328
02:25:42,210 --> 02:25:44,820
we were down to roughly a thousand 
reproductive adults.

3329
02:25:44,821 --> 02:25:47,600
One study says we hit as low as 40,
40.

3330
02:25:47,610 --> 02:25:48,780
C'Mon.
That can't be right.

3331
02:25:48,781 --> 02:25:51,150
Well,
the technical term is 40 breeding pairs.

3332
02:25:51,151 --> 02:25:53,280
Children not included,
more likely.

3333
02:25:53,281 --> 02:25:56,570
There was a drastic dip and then $5,000.
10,000

3334
02:25:56,580 --> 02:26:01,580
bedraggled.
Homosapiens struggled together and 

3335
02:26:01,580 --> 02:26:04,191
pitiful little clumps hunting and 
gathering for thousands of years until 

3336
02:26:04,191 --> 02:26:05,730
in the late stone age we humans began to
recover,

3337
02:26:05,970 --> 02:26:08,640
but for a time there says science writer
Sam Kean.

3338
02:26:08,641 --> 02:26:11,430
We damn near went extinct and that was 
because of the volcano.

3339
02:26:11,431 --> 02:26:12,820
It's amazing.
What is it?

3340
02:26:12,840 --> 02:26:15,690
What killed the lava blocks?
The Sun

3341
02:26:15,740 --> 02:26:18,050
blocks the sun.
Everybody runs out of food.

3342
02:26:18,051 --> 02:26:19,670
Everything goes extinct.
This is the matrix.

3343
02:26:19,671 --> 02:26:21,230
Yeah,
it gets really fucking cold.

3344
02:26:21,710 --> 02:26:22,430
Oh my God.
Look at that.

3345
02:26:22,431 --> 02:26:25,220
Very scientific.
The difference in Mount St Helens.

3346
02:26:25,221 --> 02:26:27,380
Little Little Fart.
Vesuvius,

3347
02:26:27,590 --> 02:26:32,590
79.
And it said the Tobi Super Volcano is 

3348
02:26:32,590 --> 02:26:33,200
the one that happens 70,000
years ago.

3349
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:38,680
Yeah,
so that was a mess around from Mount 

3350
02:26:38,680 --> 02:26:38,680
Saint Helen's.
You massive.

3351
02:26:38,680 --> 02:26:38,680
Super.
Yeah,

3352
02:26:38,680 --> 02:26:39,620
I remember that.
Captured my imagination.

3353
02:26:39,621 --> 02:26:40,220
I was a kid.
I was like,

3354
02:26:40,221 --> 02:26:42,350
we got volcanoes on this bitch.
Well,

3355
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:45,080
yellowstone is the spooky one because 
that's a super.

3356
02:26:45,081 --> 02:26:48,200
Volcano is just water.
No,

3357
02:26:48,440 --> 02:26:51,830
no stone is what they call a Caldera 
volcano.

3358
02:26:51,980 --> 02:26:53,200
Meanwhile,
what it is,

3359
02:26:53,201 --> 02:26:56,270
is it gets to this peak in the eruption 
is so violent.

3360
02:26:56,540 --> 02:27:01,540
It flattens out and the mountain 
disappears and it's just left this 

3361
02:27:01,540 --> 02:27:02,570
crater and so when they were first 
looking at it,

3362
02:27:02,571 --> 02:27:03,830
they were trying to figure out what it 
was.

3363
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:08,920
They didn't know if it was an impact 
crater was this crater from and then 

3364
02:27:08,920 --> 02:27:11,870
they started using satellite imagery,
I want to say like 20 years ago,

3365
02:27:12,530 --> 02:27:17,530
20 plus years ago,
they realized that it was a super 

3366
02:27:17,530 --> 02:27:20,251
volcano and enormous volcano.
I think it's something like 600 

3367
02:27:20,251 --> 02:27:22,850
kilometers across and if that fucker 
blows,

3368
02:27:22,910 --> 02:27:27,910
like that is a wrap for North America.
That's a wrap and it blows every six to 

3369
02:27:28,431 --> 02:27:33,431
800,000
years and the last time it blew was 

3370
02:27:33,431 --> 02:27:33,431
600,000
years ago.

3371
02:27:34,340 --> 02:27:39,340
So we could be on the verge of the.
Within the history within the next 

3372
02:27:39,340 --> 02:27:40,310
200,000
years.

3373
02:27:40,340 --> 02:27:42,830
It's likely if the history repeats 
itself again,

3374
02:27:43,100 --> 02:27:48,100
that we get some sort of unbelievably 
violent event that comes out of 

3375
02:27:48,201 --> 02:27:51,290
yellowstone that literally brings 
humanity to its knees.

3376
02:27:51,410 --> 02:27:56,410
So all of our problems with 
overpopulation destroying the 

3377
02:27:56,410 --> 02:27:58,730
environment,
crime and war and corruption,

3378
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:04,000
they will seem like nothing can because 
there will be no fucking son getting in.

3379
02:28:04,610 --> 02:28:07,340
There will be nuclear winter plants 
dying,

3380
02:28:08,280 --> 02:28:12,530
no snap and half the people disappear.
This is like these are the end times.

3381
02:28:12,531 --> 02:28:15,680
The Sky is black hundred percent 
possible that something like that.

3382
02:28:15,681 --> 02:28:18,170
If especially if there's more than one 
of them went off,

3383
02:28:18,290 --> 02:28:23,290
like say yellowstone goes off and then 
say one goes somewhere else in the 

3384
02:28:23,290 --> 02:28:23,290
world,

3385
02:28:23,290 --> 02:28:25,370
I think isn't there like seven or eight 
super volcanoes?

3386
02:28:25,610 --> 02:28:27,710
There's,
there's seven or eight of them I want to

3387
02:28:28,440 --> 02:28:33,440
could split the earth.
I think we just cover the earth with 

3388
02:28:33,440 --> 02:28:33,440
ash.
Think the problem is the ash,

3389
02:28:33,530 --> 02:28:38,530
the objections and all that stuff just 
blocks out the sun and it lingers for 

3390
02:28:38,530 --> 02:28:40,010
years.
Three of them are in the western part of

3391
02:28:40,011 --> 02:28:41,630
the United States.
What are the.

3392
02:28:42,090 --> 02:28:46,490
That's that's where we are three.
Fuck Dude.

3393
02:28:47,210 --> 02:28:49,800
What are the other ones?
Long Valley and Valley Grande.

3394
02:28:50,110 --> 02:28:52,040
What does that.
I've never heard of those.

3395
02:28:52,600 --> 02:28:57,600
That's super close to us.
Where the fuck is that one more sitting 

3396
02:28:57,600 --> 02:28:58,480
on it right now.
We look it up.

3397
02:28:59,020 --> 02:28:59,580
I,
um,

3398
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:04,600
I used to be scared of that shit and 
then I don't get scared of that some 

3399
02:29:04,880 --> 02:29:09,880
more.
If you feel different now that you've 

3400
02:29:09,880 --> 02:29:11,561
had a heart attack,
do you feel like you're a different 

3401
02:29:11,561 --> 02:29:11,561
person?

3402
02:29:11,561 --> 02:29:11,561
Do you have a second lease on life as it
were,

3403
02:29:11,561 --> 02:29:15,790
is,
but not in the way like you see in 

3404
02:29:15,790 --> 02:29:15,790
movies where you're like,
can you feel isn't mammoth?

3405
02:29:15,790 --> 02:29:19,040
Mammoth is a super volcano called Dara.
Oh,

3406
02:29:19,041 --> 02:29:22,670
shut the fuck up with Jason to mammoth 
mountain time to move.

3407
02:29:22,671 --> 02:29:26,870
We could blow mammoth could blow they,
but wouldn't you rather be that close to

3408
02:29:26,871 --> 02:29:31,490
ground zero like because you don't want 
to live in the Glendale,

3409
02:29:31,980 --> 02:29:33,760
so it just,
it just rubs.

3410
02:29:33,770 --> 02:29:35,500
It just kills everybody.
Anywhere near.

3411
02:29:35,990 --> 02:29:40,990
I don't want to be like a million miles 
away and watch it from the distance and 

3412
02:29:40,990 --> 02:29:41,960
know that in a month you're gonna be 
starving to death.

3413
02:29:42,020 --> 02:29:42,910
It's coming soon.
Yeah.

3414
02:29:42,920 --> 02:29:47,920
You're almost better off and having 
happening right underneath you and just 

3415
02:29:47,920 --> 02:29:50,981
sucking you into the lava.
Did you ever have a near death 

3416
02:29:50,981 --> 02:29:51,050
experience?
No,

3417
02:29:51,051 --> 02:29:52,370
not really.
No.

3418
02:29:52,670 --> 02:29:56,810
It's not like it is in the movies where 
you suddenly you're like,

3419
02:29:56,811 --> 02:29:58,580
now I see everything more clearly.

3420
02:29:59,050 --> 02:30:03,020
It's certainly an organizing an 
organizer like where you're like,

3421
02:30:03,021 --> 02:30:08,021
you know,
I guess that Shit just doesn't really 

3422
02:30:08,021 --> 02:30:09,971
matter so much anymore.
And periodically you sit there and go 

3423
02:30:09,971 --> 02:30:09,971
like,
oh fuck,

3424
02:30:09,971 --> 02:30:13,421
I almost died.
So it puts things in a different 

3425
02:30:13,421 --> 02:30:13,421
perspective.
But I saw a lot of folks online go on,

3426
02:30:13,421 --> 02:30:18,311
like I can't wait to see what he makes 
next man because it can be so profound 

3427
02:30:18,311 --> 02:30:22,271
and that's not true.
Next thing I'm going to make as Jane 

3428
02:30:22,271 --> 02:30:24,670
Silent Bob Reboot.
There's nothing profound about it and 

3429
02:30:24,670 --> 02:30:26,891
stuff,
but I figured I figured out because I 

3430
02:30:26,891 --> 02:30:29,920
started thinking about that.
Why I think it's [inaudible] like I've 

3431
02:30:29,920 --> 02:30:31,040
just always been,
at least for the last 20 years,

3432
02:30:31,640 --> 02:30:36,640
25 of my career just conducted myself in
a way like live a fucking bucket list 

3433
02:30:37,581 --> 02:30:39,200
life.
I just do the things I want to do.

3434
02:30:39,230 --> 02:30:44,230
Exactly.
That's why I hate you saying that you 

3435
02:30:44,230 --> 02:30:44,230
don't have any courage because that's 
where she didn't take courage.

3436
02:30:44,230 --> 02:30:46,160
That's self centered,
no centered courage is like,

3437
02:30:46,520 --> 02:30:49,190
I don't know how it's gonna work out,
but like you know,

3438
02:30:49,230 --> 02:30:52,670
fucking and also courage comes in place.
That's not about you.

3439
02:30:52,671 --> 02:30:55,010
I think for me,
I just want to do shit.

3440
02:30:55,011 --> 02:30:57,860
That seems interesting.
It seems fun and you have the confidence

3441
02:30:57,861 --> 02:30:59,610
to pursue that.
Listen Dude,

3442
02:30:59,611 --> 02:31:02,960
if this shit to teach how to use a bow 
and Arrow and you,

3443
02:31:02,961 --> 02:31:04,400
you'd figure it out.
Eventually.

3444
02:31:04,401 --> 02:31:09,401
Rise.
Just like you're losing all this weight 

3445
02:31:09,401 --> 02:31:09,401
and readjusting your life and to do I 
check if it all went down.

3446
02:31:09,401 --> 02:31:14,390
They'd be like,
eat him first and then I'd be so 

3447
02:31:14,390 --> 02:31:15,260
insulted because I'm like,
you're just going to ship me out.

3448
02:31:15,530 --> 02:31:18,620
I'm good for a podcast or two.
Please don't eat me.

3449
02:31:18,710 --> 02:31:20,730
So I have Robert Schoch

3450
02:31:20,760 --> 02:31:25,760
on the podcast as geologists from Boston
University and he is one of,

3451
02:31:25,860 --> 02:31:30,860
of many people that's now pushing this 
very controversial theory that the 

3452
02:31:30,860 --> 02:31:34,881
sphinx and many of the other structures 
in Egypt are far older than people 

3453
02:31:34,881 --> 02:31:36,750
think.
They are not just like a couple thousand

3454
02:31:36,750 --> 02:31:38,160
years ago,
but maybe even 10,000

3455
02:31:38,161 --> 02:31:39,540
years ago,
maybe even more,

3456
02:31:39,810 --> 02:31:43,590
and he bases it on water erosion marks 
and the tempo of the Sphinx,

3457
02:31:43,710 --> 02:31:46,500
like where the Sphinx was carved out and
the Sphinx enclosure.

3458
02:31:46,650 --> 02:31:51,650
There's all these deep fissures that 
they thought was sand and gravel and 

3459
02:31:51,650 --> 02:31:52,500
wind,
but he has,

3460
02:31:52,610 --> 02:31:53,670
you know,
he studied.

3461
02:31:53,671 --> 02:31:58,671
He's a geologist so he studied erosion 
his whole life and he looked at it and 

3462
02:31:58,671 --> 02:32:02,361
he's like,
this is water erosion from thousands of 

3463
02:32:02,361 --> 02:32:02,361
years of rainfall and he goes into it in
great detail.

3464
02:32:02,361 --> 02:32:06,990
The last time there was great rainfall 
in the Nile Valley was 9,000

3465
02:32:06,991 --> 02:32:11,991
years ago,
which has many thousand years before 

3466
02:32:11,991 --> 02:32:11,991
they think the pyramids were 
constructed.

3467
02:32:11,991 --> 02:32:15,920
So it's one of these things like they 
didn't even know of a civilization from 

3468
02:32:15,920 --> 02:32:19,461
9,000
years ago that was capable of cutting 

3469
02:32:19,461 --> 02:32:19,461
and moving stone like this.
Like this rewrites history,

3470
02:32:19,461 --> 02:32:21,120
history,
super reluctant.

3471
02:32:21,180 --> 02:32:24,390
But the idea that all of these people 
have these people that are talking about

3472
02:32:24,391 --> 02:32:29,391
these ancient civilizations is that 
humanity rose to a very high level and 

3473
02:32:29,391 --> 02:32:33,711
build some incredible structures.
And then something like that Super 

3474
02:32:33,711 --> 02:32:35,160
Volcano or an asteroid will impact,
or an ice age,

3475
02:32:35,190 --> 02:32:40,190
some gigantic catastrophic event wiped 
out a shitload of fucking people and 

3476
02:32:41,221 --> 02:32:44,010
then people were forced to rebuild and 
sort of relearn.

3477
02:32:44,220 --> 02:32:46,800
So if you're looking at some of the 
construction of the Pyramids,

3478
02:32:46,801 --> 02:32:51,801
like the Great Pyramid of Giza,
I'm pretty sure they've dated that to 

3479
02:32:51,801 --> 02:32:51,801
2,500
BC.

3480
02:32:52,170 --> 02:32:57,170
So the people that made the Sphinx and 
even some of the other structures they 

3481
02:32:57,170 --> 02:33:00,930
might have been from a longer ago in 
history,

3482
02:33:01,560 --> 02:33:03,720
in relationship to the construction,
the Sphinx,

3483
02:33:03,780 --> 02:33:06,690
than we are to the construction of the 
Great Pyramid.

3484
02:33:07,320 --> 02:33:09,810
Like we might have.
What we were talking about,

3485
02:33:10,110 --> 02:33:12,300
the Great Pyramid was 5,000
years old.

3486
02:33:12,460 --> 02:33:17,460
Right now I have to.
It's entirely possible if the Great 

3487
02:33:19,020 --> 02:33:20,610
Pyramid of Giza would say,
think of somewhere around 50,000

3488
02:33:20,611 --> 02:33:22,590
years old.
If that was 5,000

3489
02:33:22,591 --> 02:33:26,970
years old,
the Sphinx might be 4,000

3490
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:32,000
or more years older than that.
There might be structures that are 

3491
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,050
$10,500,
even 30,000

3492
02:33:34,051 --> 02:33:35,310
years old.
There's some people's,

3493
02:33:35,430 --> 02:33:37,590
when they go deep,
like a guy named John Anthony West,

3494
02:33:37,591 --> 02:33:42,591
that was his deep speculation based on 
the way this finks lines up with 

3495
02:33:42,591 --> 02:33:44,070
constellations and the Constellation 
Leo,

3496
02:33:44,220 --> 02:33:47,100
it does it at like 10,500
BC,

3497
02:33:47,101 --> 02:33:50,490
but also it does it uh,
or 10,500

3498
02:33:50,491 --> 02:33:53,490
years ago.
But it also does it at like 30,

3499
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:55,770
30,000
years ago or somewhere in that range,

3500
02:33:55,771 --> 02:34:00,771
like really long,
which people are going to get the fuck 

3501
02:34:00,771 --> 02:34:00,771
outta here.
That's just not possible.

3502
02:34:00,771 --> 02:34:01,830
And his,
his take was like,

3503
02:34:01,980 --> 02:34:04,680
we don't know,
we're were just talking about rocks.

3504
02:34:04,860 --> 02:34:06,690
We don't know how these rocks got into 
this shape.

3505
02:34:06,930 --> 02:34:11,930
This is just no recorded history.
Or they used to have some,

3506
02:34:12,720 --> 02:34:14,940
but they know they've got hieroglyphs.
I've got a few things,

3507
02:34:14,941 --> 02:34:18,180
but they used to have only had like a,
a,

3508
02:34:18,300 --> 02:34:23,300
like a incredibly developed society.
The mayans and the aztecs built some 

3509
02:34:24,101 --> 02:34:27,700
incredible structures and they were like
really into constellations as well.

3510
02:34:27,701 --> 02:34:30,730
They aligned up a lot of their 
structures with the constellations.

3511
02:34:30,731 --> 02:34:35,731
They knew a lot about the summer 
solstice and they had a really 

3512
02:34:35,731 --> 02:34:38,530
complicated calendar that was like a 13 
lunar cycle calendar,

3513
02:34:38,760 --> 02:34:39,330
you know,
they.

3514
02:34:39,590 --> 02:34:41,740
There was like the thing where the Mayan
calendar,

3515
02:34:41,741 --> 02:34:44,290
we're supposed to end December 21st 2000
a couple of years ago.

3516
02:34:44,291 --> 02:34:44,860
Yeah,
dude,

3517
02:34:44,861 --> 02:34:48,670
I thought it was over telling everybody 
we've got a couple more years pro.

3518
02:34:48,830 --> 02:34:53,830
We have your life.
I've really seem to know what they were 

3519
02:34:53,830 --> 02:34:53,830
doing.

3520
02:34:53,830 --> 02:34:55,480
Go back.
So if that turns out to be the case.

3521
02:34:55,840 --> 02:34:59,020
Humanity has experienced these great,
great,

3522
02:34:59,380 --> 02:35:04,380
like high achievements in construction 
methods and their ability to put 

3523
02:35:05,021 --> 02:35:07,960
together these enormous structures and 
then capitalism.

3524
02:35:08,380 --> 02:35:10,780
People die off,
they get down to a small number and then

3525
02:35:10,781 --> 02:35:13,340
they rebuild and then they do these over
the,

3526
02:35:13,350 --> 02:35:13,930
you know,
these,

3527
02:35:13,931 --> 02:35:18,931
these dips and ups and downs over the 
course of thousands and thousands of 

3528
02:35:18,931 --> 02:35:20,350
years,
which we got to put it into perspective.

3529
02:35:20,620 --> 02:35:24,850
This country is only 250 years old.
That's nothing.

3530
02:35:25,090 --> 02:35:28,630
So if you went back just let's go,
let's go full crazy.

3531
02:35:28,750 --> 02:35:31,900
Let's go back 500 years,
go back 500 years,

3532
02:35:31,901 --> 02:35:36,901
which is nothing in terms of the history
of the planet and nothing in terms of 

3533
02:35:36,901 --> 02:35:38,200
even the history of human beings 
relatively,

3534
02:35:38,350 --> 02:35:40,810
but 500 years.
There's nothing here,

3535
02:35:40,811 --> 02:35:44,260
but native Americans,
there's no structures is a few Europeans

3536
02:35:44,261 --> 02:35:44,890
that have visited.

3537
02:35:45,040 --> 02:35:47,530
There's a few set of people that have 
come over and boats,

3538
02:35:47,770 --> 02:35:49,870
but there's no buildings in terms of 
like,

3539
02:35:49,871 --> 02:35:53,770
there's no New York City.
There's no Chicago 500 years ago.

3540
02:35:53,771 --> 02:35:58,771
There's nothing.
There's none of this goes outside and 

3541
02:35:58,771 --> 02:36:02,290
sit around and do a three slash 16 and 
look around and realize how improbable 

3542
02:36:02,290 --> 02:36:03,940
it all is.
Go a thousand years before that,

3543
02:36:03,941 --> 02:36:05,500
same thing,
thousand years before that.

3544
02:36:05,501 --> 02:36:06,880
Same thing.
This is empty.

3545
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,730
This is empty for thousands and 
thousands of years now.

3546
02:36:10,120 --> 02:36:13,180
Two hundred and 50 years later.
It's crazy.

3547
02:36:13,390 --> 02:36:18,390
It stacked up with buildings and 
construction methods that we were never 

3548
02:36:18,390 --> 02:36:19,690
capable of 200 years ago,
300 years ago,

3549
02:36:19,691 --> 02:36:22,420
500 years ago,
we couldn't build these things.

3550
02:36:22,421 --> 02:36:24,280
We couldn't make airplane.
We didn't have the knowledge yet.

3551
02:36:24,281 --> 02:36:29,281
We didn't understand it yet.
The idea is that people have gone 

3552
02:36:29,281 --> 02:36:32,131
through these great,
great heights many times and but they 

3553
02:36:32,131 --> 02:36:36,301
did it in different ways and that's why 
like when you look at the construction 

3554
02:36:36,301 --> 02:36:37,750
of this finks and the pyramids,
nobody builds anything like the pyramids

3555
02:36:37,751 --> 02:36:38,230
today.

3556
02:36:38,500 --> 02:36:40,540
Two million,
300,000

3557
02:36:40,541 --> 02:36:45,541
stones.
Some of them cut from a quarry that was 

3558
02:36:45,541 --> 02:36:48,061
hundreds of miles away.
They used to take the fucking rocks and 

3559
02:36:48,061 --> 02:36:49,000
float them down on boats and fit them 
into places.

3560
02:36:49,001 --> 02:36:51,190
It's crazy.
It's the knowledge.

3561
02:36:51,191 --> 02:36:53,410
They must have had the wisdom,
the,

3562
02:36:53,470 --> 02:36:58,470
the,
the understanding of construction 

3563
02:36:58,470 --> 02:37:00,571
methods.
If you're off just a little bit with 

3564
02:37:00,571 --> 02:37:02,731
each rock,
it's not going to meet up at the top of 

3565
02:37:02,731 --> 02:37:05,011
this perfect pyramid shape.
I mean it's a marvel of mathematics and 

3566
02:37:05,011 --> 02:37:09,240
engineering and construction and by 
everyone's estimate it's 5,000

3567
02:37:10,181 --> 02:37:13,750
something years old are in the range of 
4,500

3568
02:37:13,751 --> 02:37:15,040
years old,
somewhere around there,

3569
02:37:15,480 --> 02:37:19,230
sane along and says it may be older than
you

3570
02:37:19,420 --> 02:37:20,950
might be older than that.
Well that not.

3571
02:37:20,980 --> 02:37:23,590
They don't think the pyramid.
I'm pretty sure,

3572
02:37:23,770 --> 02:37:27,130
and maybe this is controversial as well,
but I think it's based on the biological

3573
02:37:27,131 --> 02:37:30,220
material that they can pull out from in 
between the cracks and the stones.

3574
02:37:30,840 --> 02:37:35,840
I think people who died was stuff like 
anything physical or anything biological

3575
02:37:36,611 --> 02:37:41,611
rather like wood or or patrice that 
might've went into building the chat.

3576
02:37:41,740 --> 02:37:43,420
That's how they'd carbon dates 
something.

3577
02:37:43,450 --> 02:37:46,960
Apparently they need carbon,
so it's really tough to carbon date like

3578
02:37:46,970 --> 02:37:49,660
a stone because you don't know what your
dating.

3579
02:37:49,661 --> 02:37:54,661
Are you dating the way the age,
the stone was cut or the stone was 

3580
02:37:54,661 --> 02:37:56,470
created.
Like what the fuck is that?

3581
02:37:56,830 --> 02:37:59,980
Have you had a giant piece of limestone?
What are you dating?

3582
02:37:59,981 --> 02:38:02,320
Are you dating the actual origin of the 
limestone?

3583
02:38:02,500 --> 02:38:05,630
It might be millions of years old.
I don't know how long limestone is like,

3584
02:38:06,370 --> 02:38:06,910
isn't it?

3585
02:38:07,210 --> 02:38:12,210
I think limestone is seashells that have
been ground down and smashed by gravity 

3586
02:38:13,661 --> 02:38:17,830
and layers and layers of earth until 
they form into a stone.

3587
02:38:18,310 --> 02:38:22,990
See if I made that up,
it might have sounded awfully metal.

3588
02:38:23,320 --> 02:38:28,320
There's some shit like that for sure.
Like I know travertine is that 

3589
02:38:28,320 --> 02:38:32,460
travertine is like old seashells that 
have been compressed down at the bottom 

3590
02:38:32,460 --> 02:38:35,140
of the ocean forever until they form 
like this hard layer.

3591
02:38:35,290 --> 02:38:36,580
Pretty sure that's true too.
That might be.

3592
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:38,290
That might also be bullshit.
Fuck,

3593
02:38:38,310 --> 02:38:39,940
you're well read.
Nope.

3594
02:38:40,360 --> 02:38:41,950
Incorrect.
My wrong.

3595
02:38:43,450 --> 02:38:48,450
Most limestone deposits are made from 
the shells of Microsoft scopic sea 

3596
02:38:48,450 --> 02:38:52,141
organisms.
Coral reefs are a beautiful example of 

3597
02:38:52,141 --> 02:38:53,680
organic sedimentary rocks made by 
creatures that are still living.

3598
02:38:54,040 --> 02:38:54,700
Okay.
So yeah,

3599
02:38:54,701 --> 02:38:56,530
it is.
So limestone deposits,

3600
02:38:56,550 --> 02:38:59,260
it's made by the shells of microscopic 
sea organisms.

3601
02:38:59,261 --> 02:39:01,630
So these shells,
they compress down,

3602
02:39:01,631 --> 02:39:06,631
they make this stone they built,
they built fucking giant buildings out 

3603
02:39:06,631 --> 02:39:09,460
of this shit.
So just think of the age of that stone.

3604
02:39:09,461 --> 02:39:11,170
Like how,
what,

3605
02:39:11,290 --> 02:39:12,580
how old was that shit?

3606
02:39:13,800 --> 02:39:18,800
So everything that we think we know 
could literally be incorrect by a couple

3607
02:39:20,081 --> 02:39:20,410
thousand.

3608
02:39:20,460 --> 02:39:21,630
Yeah.
But even that,

3609
02:39:21,631 --> 02:39:26,631
it's like,
I think it's weird that we're holding 

3610
02:39:26,631 --> 02:39:26,970
onto these numbers instead of like 
saying,

3611
02:39:26,971 --> 02:39:31,971
well we have some tests that show that 
we're pretty sure that this was created 

3612
02:39:32,221 --> 02:39:34,590
around them,
but that you might be right.

3613
02:39:34,620 --> 02:39:39,620
That might be older,
but people like really resist what he's 

3614
02:39:39,620 --> 02:39:42,021
saying.
They're really resistant because you'd 

3615
02:39:42,021 --> 02:39:44,031
have to go back and a lot of people that
got degrees in Egyptology like do you 

3616
02:39:44,031 --> 02:39:45,390
have to rewrite what we know?
Because once they.

3617
02:39:45,540 --> 02:39:49,290
Once they decide this is the age where 
this was made and taught Moses,

3618
02:39:49,291 --> 02:39:53,010
the third is responsible for this and 
this guy's responsible for that.

3619
02:39:53,190 --> 02:39:58,190
Once they write that and sell the books,
super hard to take that back and 

3620
02:39:58,190 --> 02:40:02,310
suddenly be like a super hard to admit.
They don't really know and so this

3621
02:40:02,670 --> 02:40:04,410
and this isn't something like,
hey,

3622
02:40:04,411 --> 02:40:08,580
Pluto's not a planet anymore because we 
were off by its size or whatever.

3623
02:40:08,850 --> 02:40:13,850
This is like we had literally no idea 
that people existed that

3624
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:19,010
far back when people existed,
but we didn't know they were capable of 

3625
02:40:19,010 --> 02:40:19,190
building things like that.
But I'm saying like,

3626
02:40:19,230 --> 02:40:22,230
why is that even surprising?
If people 4,000

3627
02:40:22,320 --> 02:40:24,750
fucking years ago,
it could build something as crazy as the

3628
02:40:24,751 --> 02:40:28,560
great pyramid.
Like why would I be shocked that someone

3629
02:40:28,561 --> 02:40:33,561
4,000
years before that could build a sphinx 

3630
02:40:33,561 --> 02:40:33,561
or 4,000
years before that?

3631
02:40:33,561 --> 02:40:37,341
I can build some other fucking temple,
I mean it's also just a number that's 

3632
02:40:37,341 --> 02:40:40,491
really like fucking ridiculous to get 
your head around where you're to wait 

3633
02:40:40,491 --> 02:40:42,390
4,000
from now backwards and then 4,000

3634
02:40:42,480 --> 02:40:44,010
from that point,
like forget it.

3635
02:40:45,180 --> 02:40:49,740
And then to think that humanity was 
probably restarted at least to a certain

3636
02:40:49,741 --> 02:40:51,600
extent,
somewhere around the end of the ice age,

3637
02:40:51,690 --> 02:40:55,020
like the humanity recovered and started 
flourishing again.

3638
02:40:55,470 --> 02:40:56,220
So who knows,
you know,

3639
02:40:56,270 --> 02:41:01,270
w what,
what number of people we dipped down to 

3640
02:41:01,270 --> 02:41:01,270
15,000
plus years ago if they were,

3641
02:41:01,890 --> 02:41:06,030
if they built the spanx further back 
than we thought they did,

3642
02:41:06,330 --> 02:41:07,830
did they have language skills?

3643
02:41:08,170 --> 02:41:10,860
It must build something like that 
without being like,

3644
02:41:10,861 --> 02:41:12,510
hey,
put a nose on it.

3645
02:41:12,720 --> 02:41:15,150
I think they're pretty sure that 
language is 40,000

3646
02:41:15,151 --> 02:41:16,680
years old.
See if that's true.

3647
02:41:17,400 --> 02:41:22,400
I think that's what they think.
I think they think language in the form 

3648
02:41:22,400 --> 02:41:23,250
that we would describe as language,
you know,

3649
02:41:23,251 --> 02:41:24,790
like maybe,
um,

3650
02:41:25,820 --> 02:41:29,430
you know,
I don't know what language is 200,000.

3651
02:41:29,820 --> 02:41:30,550
What?
Okay.

3652
02:41:32,550 --> 02:41:35,340
Psychology today though,
definitely probably smarter than me.

3653
02:41:35,730 --> 02:41:37,230
Um,
so,

3654
02:41:37,231 --> 02:41:38,730
okay,
so 200,000

3655
02:41:38,731 --> 02:41:40,770
years ago,
more over around 50,000

3656
02:41:40,771 --> 02:41:43,070
years ago for a period referred to by 
archeologists,

3657
02:41:43,150 --> 02:41:48,150
the Upper Paleolithic and unprecedented 
cultural explosion began to manifest 

3658
02:41:48,150 --> 02:41:50,100
itself for human communities.
Maybe that's what I remember.

3659
02:41:50,400 --> 02:41:55,400
So 50,000
years ago is the number of this in my 

3660
02:41:55,400 --> 02:41:55,400
head.
So language,

3661
02:41:55,400 --> 02:41:56,760
um,
they had it a long time.

3662
02:41:56,790 --> 02:42:01,790
They didn't start.
They don't think at least they started 

3663
02:42:01,790 --> 02:42:02,310
writing shit until somewhere around 
10,000

3664
02:42:02,311 --> 02:42:07,311
years ago,
but they don't even know if that's the 

3665
02:42:07,311 --> 02:42:07,311
case.

3666
02:42:07,311 --> 02:42:09,330
But I think the oldest known writing 
that we know of today,

3667
02:42:09,331 --> 02:42:11,760
I think is that stuff that comes out of 
Iraq.

3668
02:42:12,480 --> 02:42:14,040
Cuneiform,
I think it's called.

3669
02:42:14,041 --> 02:42:19,041
It's from the ancient Sumerians.
They were the oldest civilization that 

3670
02:42:19,041 --> 02:42:19,770
we're like modern,
not modern,

3671
02:42:19,771 --> 02:42:22,340
but advanced civilization that we're 
currently aware of.

3672
02:42:22,380 --> 02:42:24,150
And they kept records.
Yeah,

3673
02:42:24,151 --> 02:42:27,120
they wrote with like old school.
Did you ever do any carpentry?

3674
02:42:27,390 --> 02:42:30,960
Oh No.
When I was a kid in Boston,

3675
02:42:31,020 --> 02:42:34,650
I've worked on a lot of houses,
demolition stuff and carpentry stuff.

3676
02:42:34,651 --> 02:42:39,651
And you would go in these old old houses
and they had these weird nails because 

3677
02:42:39,651 --> 02:42:42,950
the nails were all handmade back then.
There weren't a nail like you think of a

3678
02:42:42,951 --> 02:42:47,951
nail,
like a table top with a pole underneath 

3679
02:42:47,951 --> 02:42:50,091
it.
It's not what the nails where the nails 

3680
02:42:50,091 --> 02:42:51,980
were like this weird kind of like almost
rectangle or triangle thing and that 

3681
02:42:51,980 --> 02:42:55,020
that was exactly what cuneiform looks 
like.

3682
02:42:55,021 --> 02:42:57,600
It has like a very specific pull up,
some,

3683
02:42:57,601 --> 02:43:00,660
a Sumerian,
Sumerian cuneiform.

3684
02:43:00,870 --> 02:43:05,870
So as a series of lines and it's really,
it's got to be insanely hard to decipher

3685
02:43:07,590 --> 02:43:12,590
like what,
what they were writing and what they 

3686
02:43:12,590 --> 02:43:12,590
meant by all this.
But this is their language.

3687
02:43:12,880 --> 02:43:14,320
That shit that you're looking at right 
there.

3688
02:43:15,160 --> 02:43:19,000
That right there.
So it seems like an intermediate between

3689
02:43:19,001 --> 02:43:22,030
hieroglyphics and an alphabet.
Yeah,

3690
02:43:22,031 --> 02:43:22,930
I mean,
I don't know.

3691
02:43:23,010 --> 02:43:27,580
I'm still considered graphic when you 
look at it like it's still a little.

3692
02:43:27,581 --> 02:43:29,920
Well that's not,
that's more toward letter.

3693
02:43:29,980 --> 02:43:31,600
What is that?
That's like a.

3694
02:43:31,610 --> 02:43:33,580
If you saw that on a spaceship,
you'd be like,

3695
02:43:33,610 --> 02:43:34,990
oh,
the alien writing.

3696
02:43:35,050 --> 02:43:40,050
And apparently it's not that alien,
but doesn't that look like if you saw 

3697
02:43:40,050 --> 02:43:42,160
that on a spaceship that looks like 
something from like hanger 18,

3698
02:43:42,940 --> 02:43:47,940
right.
If that was on the outside of a spatial 

3699
02:43:47,940 --> 02:43:47,940
star it.
But yeah,

3700
02:43:47,940 --> 02:43:47,950
it looks very.
Stargate to me like,

3701
02:43:47,951 --> 02:43:51,250
look at that dude.
Dad is like some sort of like if you had

3702
02:43:51,251 --> 02:43:54,170
a computer printout,
remember those old school printouts that

3703
02:43:54,180 --> 02:43:59,180
would run through computers,
like the little holes punched in them 

3704
02:43:59,180 --> 02:43:59,180
that would look kind of like that.

3705
02:44:00,070 --> 02:44:05,070
The a man that's the oldest language.
I think that shit's 6,000

3706
02:44:05,141 --> 02:44:07,540
years old.
I think it's somewhere around there.

3707
02:44:07,660 --> 02:44:12,660
And that's like Babylonia has been able 
to decipher an alphabet or be like 48 

3708
02:44:12,881 --> 02:44:14,080
letters in the alphabet.
Yeah.

3709
02:44:14,081 --> 02:44:17,370
I don't know what they found,
but they found a lot of cool shit there.

3710
02:44:17,430 --> 02:44:19,660
Felt a lot of cool shit from the 
Sumerians.

3711
02:44:19,720 --> 02:44:21,150
I remember as a kid,
like,

3712
02:44:21,340 --> 02:44:26,340
you know,
I went to Catholic school as a kid and 

3713
02:44:26,340 --> 02:44:27,460
the big story when we were younger was 
we got like new nuns,

3714
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:29,140
sisters.
Uh,

3715
02:44:29,170 --> 02:44:31,660
like at a certain point,
like when I started Catholic school,

3716
02:44:31,661 --> 02:44:36,661
Our Lady of perpetual help,
they had old school nuns that would wrap

3717
02:44:36,671 --> 02:44:40,870
your fucking knuckles and shit like your
parents would talk about and then all of

3718
02:44:40,871 --> 02:44:45,871
a sudden these new sisters come in,
the sisters of the Franciscan sisters of

3719
02:44:48,611 --> 02:44:52,630
the infant Jesus,
and they were more like about education,

3720
02:44:52,631 --> 02:44:55,200
almost like a Jesuit priest,
so that,

3721
02:44:55,201 --> 02:45:00,201
you know,
they definitely had their vows and 

3722
02:45:00,201 --> 02:45:01,981
whatnot,
but they were more progressive in their 

3723
02:45:01,981 --> 02:45:04,150
thinking than like the previous 
generation that had come prior to them.

3724
02:45:05,370 --> 02:45:10,370
So Sister Teresa was like,
our eighth grade teacher captured our 

3725
02:45:10,370 --> 02:45:13,300
imaginations with the Dead Sea scrolls 
through about how,

3726
02:45:13,610 --> 02:45:17,110
you know,
there was a bible that we all worked off

3727
02:45:17,111 --> 02:45:22,111
of.
And then thanks to some kid who threw a 

3728
02:45:22,111 --> 02:45:25,401
rock in a cave.
They found all these jars and inside of 

3729
02:45:25,401 --> 02:45:27,270
the jurors perfectly preserved where all
these writings on parts.

3730
02:45:28,270 --> 02:45:29,440
Yes.
Yeah.

3731
02:45:29,470 --> 02:45:34,470
And so that's where we started getting a
clearer picture of the Bible and that's 

3732
02:45:34,841 --> 02:45:39,400
where they found bibles or gospels that 
aren't included in our Bible.

3733
02:45:39,401 --> 02:45:40,720
And Man,
it was like,

3734
02:45:40,810 --> 02:45:44,200
this is a minute before raiders of the 
lost Ark came out.

3735
02:45:44,770 --> 02:45:46,660
So then when that movie came out,
you were like,

3736
02:45:46,690 --> 02:45:49,240
it's all,
it's all connected.

3737
02:45:49,950 --> 02:45:50,380
Yeah.
The,

3738
02:45:50,381 --> 02:45:52,030
the scrolls are fascinating man.
You know,

3739
02:45:52,031 --> 02:45:57,031
they had to use DNA testing to make sure
that they were getting the pieces of 

3740
02:45:57,851 --> 02:46:00,550
this parchment from the same animal 
skin.

3741
02:46:00,850 --> 02:46:04,060
So like say if you had these pieces,
they did,

3742
02:46:04,150 --> 02:46:08,100
they had so many,
they studied them for years and they for

3743
02:46:08,120 --> 02:46:10,040
to decipher them would have to lay them 
out

3744
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:11,600
on tables.
You ever see what they look like,

3745
02:46:11,900 --> 02:46:16,900
like laid out on tables.
And so one of the ways that they had to 

3746
02:46:16,900 --> 02:46:20,050
determine where pieces would go,
this is a incredibly painstaking 

3747
02:46:20,050 --> 02:46:23,681
process.
They had to take small bits of organic 

3748
02:46:23,681 --> 02:46:25,730
material because it's animal skins.
And then they would run it through a DNA

3749
02:46:25,731 --> 02:46:26,450
test and go,
okay,

3750
02:46:26,451 --> 02:46:29,840
this is the same animal.
This animal is where,

3751
02:46:29,870 --> 02:46:30,570
uh,
you know,

3752
02:46:30,650 --> 02:46:35,650
all these pieces go on here.
This is likely for the same piece of 

3753
02:46:35,650 --> 02:46:35,650
skin.
Oh,

3754
02:46:35,650 --> 02:46:37,130
amazing dude.
And it's crazy.

3755
02:46:37,530 --> 02:46:42,530
And I,
I think it's the only version of the 

3756
02:46:42,530 --> 02:46:42,530
Bible that was written in Aramaic.
Yes.

3757
02:46:42,530 --> 02:46:43,220
Well done.
Fuck.

3758
02:46:43,221 --> 02:46:43,770
You're well.
Read.

3759
02:46:45,260 --> 02:46:46,340
Well,
read about drugs.

3760
02:46:46,400 --> 02:46:51,400
See,
this is all about John Marco Allegro we 

3761
02:46:51,400 --> 02:46:51,400
talked about.
Yeah,

3762
02:46:51,400 --> 02:46:55,391
that guy found out about the Dead Sea 
Scrolls and the Christian myth and the 

3763
02:46:55,391 --> 02:46:57,320
sacred mushroom.
And the cross is two books on that.

3764
02:46:57,680 --> 02:46:59,390
But he was a.
He was a guy who studied that.

3765
02:46:59,450 --> 02:47:04,070
The Dead Sea Scrolls.
At what point do we just saw an image of

3766
02:47:04,071 --> 02:47:06,920
the Dead Sea Scroll?
Parchment spread out point.

3767
02:47:06,921 --> 02:47:08,750
Do I give up instantly?
You know what I'm saying?

3768
02:47:08,751 --> 02:47:10,310
Like where somebody is like,
good luck.

3769
02:47:10,340 --> 02:47:12,470
You might have to dns.
Goodbye.

3770
02:47:12,620 --> 02:47:13,190
Yeah,
I'd be like,

3771
02:47:13,191 --> 02:47:14,390
Yo,
if you guys need funding,

3772
02:47:14,640 --> 02:47:16,670
I'm down to Tony.
I got to jet.

3773
02:47:16,790 --> 02:47:17,830
I got a spot at the store.

3774
02:47:19,860 --> 02:47:21,560
The store is not for me,
man.

3775
02:47:21,710 --> 02:47:23,870
I mean,
but it is for somebody and I'm grateful.

3776
02:47:24,650 --> 02:47:26,150
I'm grateful that there's guys like 
that,

3777
02:47:26,151 --> 02:47:31,151
like Robert Schoch who's taking these 
trips to Egypt to study this and really 

3778
02:47:31,151 --> 02:47:34,520
putting his neck out there releasing 
this very controversial theory.

3779
02:47:34,820 --> 02:47:39,820
I'm glad there's all these people out 
there that are questioning these things 

3780
02:47:39,820 --> 02:47:42,080
and looking into these things that 
someone has the energy to study the Dead

3781
02:47:42,080 --> 02:47:47,080
Sea Scrolls and to go over and 
apparently there's some wacky ass 

3782
02:47:47,080 --> 02:47:49,301
fucking crazy stories in there.
Like they've tried to compare the 

3783
02:47:49,301 --> 02:47:50,360
stories for the like way more extreme 
way,

3784
02:47:50,361 --> 02:47:52,550
way weirder to the point where people 
are only.

3785
02:47:52,551 --> 02:47:56,060
I think we should use these stories to 
involve the same characters.

3786
02:47:56,120 --> 02:48:01,120
I don't know much about two years.
I don't think so.

3787
02:48:01,540 --> 02:48:04,520
What is like maybe we could find because
that story has a problem,

3788
02:48:04,521 --> 02:48:08,330
isn't chunk missing these 12 and then 
next time they pick them up.

3789
02:48:08,330 --> 02:48:09,540
He's 31.
Yeah.

3790
02:48:10,440 --> 02:48:15,440
Um,
I think that's probably something that 

3791
02:48:15,440 --> 02:48:15,740
can't be just googled.
I think where was Jesus probably have to

3792
02:48:15,741 --> 02:48:18,650
read a book on like what they learned 
out of the Dead Sea Scrolls.

3793
02:48:18,950 --> 02:48:23,950
But I remember there was some sort of a 
documentary on all of the hidden truths 

3794
02:48:23,950 --> 02:48:27,961
of the deaths,
the Dead Sea Scrolls and why these 

3795
02:48:27,961 --> 02:48:30,761
Christians were trying to omit it from 
you and not put it into the final 

3796
02:48:30,951 --> 02:48:32,750
version of the Bible.
You know,

3797
02:48:32,770 --> 02:48:34,580
it's,
it's so nice to gospels,

3798
02:48:34,581 --> 02:48:36,740
they pull a lot from,
from there.

3799
02:48:36,741 --> 02:48:40,040
The gnostics were people that it was a 
faith,

3800
02:48:40,041 --> 02:48:45,041
I guess,
or a section of faith that they were 

3801
02:48:45,501 --> 02:48:47,540
great record keepers,
uh,

3802
02:48:48,020 --> 02:48:53,020
but they were also not necessarily like,
and it was the Christ himself,

3803
02:48:53,060 --> 02:48:58,060
the mighty son of God.
They were a bit more practical in their 

3804
02:48:58,060 --> 02:48:59,110
telling of the tale.
Yeah.

3805
02:48:59,180 --> 02:49:01,160
Didn't religion it up quite so much.

3806
02:49:01,310 --> 02:49:06,310
If you had,
if you could go back to a time and 

3807
02:49:06,310 --> 02:49:09,041
observe life like being like a giant 
bulletproof hamster wheel and observe 

3808
02:49:10,201 --> 02:49:13,860
life,
would you go to the dinosaur era and see

3809
02:49:13,861 --> 02:49:18,861
like live t rexes running around and,
and predators and crazy thick atmosphere

3810
02:49:20,161 --> 02:49:23,640
and heavy vegetation of pre 65 million 
years ago?

3811
02:49:23,850 --> 02:49:28,850
Or would you go and watch people from 
like 5,000

3812
02:49:29,131 --> 02:49:30,690
years ago?
We get one shot,

3813
02:49:30,930 --> 02:49:32,470
one shot either,
you know,

3814
02:49:32,480 --> 02:49:36,310
does the dinosaurs because I'm like,
I've seen Jurassic Park and then realize

3815
02:49:36,450 --> 02:49:39,560
there's probably aren't going to be 
nearly as impressive as of you.

3816
02:49:40,260 --> 02:49:42,000
That being said,
Jurassic Park,

3817
02:49:42,001 --> 02:49:44,140
you see that being said,
I,

3818
02:49:44,280 --> 02:49:47,720
I go,
I go to the.

3819
02:49:47,790 --> 02:49:52,790
I go to the Christ era because that 
might solve a lot of problems if I can 

3820
02:49:52,981 --> 02:49:57,630
come back and be like he was real and he
turns out he was the son of God.

3821
02:49:58,860 --> 02:50:01,980
Let's listen to the clerks guy time 
travel.

3822
02:50:01,990 --> 02:50:04,350
He thinks he knows everything.
You got fooled by magician brow.

3823
02:50:04,380 --> 02:50:09,380
Who's the guy who literally a WHO's,
who's telling us that the Sphinx is 

3824
02:50:09,380 --> 02:50:13,371
older than it is.
Somebody's got to put their neck out 

3825
02:50:13,371 --> 02:50:13,371
there sometimes and I'd be willing to be
the guy to do.

3826
02:50:13,371 --> 02:50:14,580
John.
Anthony West was the guy.

3827
02:50:14,880 --> 02:50:16,440
He's dead now.
He just died recently.

3828
02:50:16,620 --> 02:50:17,430
What?
Yeah,

3829
02:50:17,460 --> 02:50:22,460
John Anthony West.
I thought this is the guy who's kind of 

3830
02:50:22,460 --> 02:50:22,460
Robert Schoch.
That's what I'm talking.

3831
02:50:22,460 --> 02:50:22,680
He's another one of them.
He's the geologists.

3832
02:50:22,890 --> 02:50:25,920
John Anthony West was the guy who was 
making all these dvds about it.

3833
02:50:25,921 --> 02:50:29,220
He's a really serious egyptologists that
just passed away,

3834
02:50:29,240 --> 02:50:34,240
passed away.
He's the one who's really trying to put 

3835
02:50:34,240 --> 02:50:34,240
these old,
old age answer.

3836
02:50:34,240 --> 02:50:37,360
So he was the one that first flow the 
theory that leg hippie older than you.

3837
02:50:37,400 --> 02:50:42,400
He just had a.
he's got this crazy DVD series called 

3838
02:50:42,400 --> 02:50:42,400
magical Egypt.

3839
02:50:42,400 --> 02:50:44,250
It's phenomenal.
I think he's got a two,

3840
02:50:44,520 --> 02:50:46,500
one and two.
I really only watched one,

3841
02:50:46,710 --> 02:50:48,090
but it's so good,
man.

3842
02:50:48,091 --> 02:50:53,091
I mean it's like a six DVD series all on
the mysteries of Egypt.

3843
02:50:53,290 --> 02:50:54,750
Put the hell happened.
We just got some.

3844
02:50:55,500 --> 02:50:57,330
That's me.
Oh fuck you.

3845
02:50:57,331 --> 02:50:59,550
Siri.
Like it just starts recording me,

3846
02:50:59,780 --> 02:51:04,780
man.
Your phone just coming to life and she 

3847
02:51:04,780 --> 02:51:05,940
just started the government man.
The found.

3848
02:51:05,960 --> 02:51:08,790
I'm talking to Roseanne.
Um,

3849
02:51:09,660 --> 02:51:12,330
where are we talking about?
What was I just talking about?

3850
02:51:12,860 --> 02:51:14,380
Magical,
magical age,

3851
02:51:14,570 --> 02:51:16,050
DVD series.
So this,

3852
02:51:16,051 --> 02:51:21,051
this guy is the one who got me,
like really just wrapping my head around

3853
02:51:21,271 --> 02:51:25,740
the concept of civilizations collapse.
And then a thousand years later rebuilds

3854
02:51:25,741 --> 02:51:30,741
again.
And then do you think about what the 

3855
02:51:30,741 --> 02:51:30,741
United States was like 500 years ago?
It was non existent.

3856
02:51:30,741 --> 02:51:35,691
And now look at what it is now that 
these great moments of change happen 

3857
02:51:35,691 --> 02:51:38,220
periodically in human history,
especially in places where there's a lot

3858
02:51:38,221 --> 02:51:43,221
of commerce and there's a lot of food,
like the rich vast wilderness and a 

3859
02:51:46,190 --> 02:51:51,190
river is filled with fish and places 
where people could get enough food and 

3860
02:51:51,190 --> 02:51:53,610
they would build these cities and then 
they start inventing shit and innovating

3861
02:51:53,611 --> 02:51:55,290
and 100 years later they'd be better.

3862
02:51:55,440 --> 02:51:56,970
Two hundred years later they'd be better
than that.

3863
02:51:57,060 --> 02:52:02,060
Five hundred years later they'd have 
crazy structures and then they'll be 

3864
02:52:02,060 --> 02:52:03,330
building things and apparently this is 
what it was like in the Nile Valley when

3865
02:52:03,331 --> 02:52:08,331
they were.
When they were constructing all these 

3866
02:52:08,331 --> 02:52:08,331
things.
It was just a bounty of food.

3867
02:52:08,331 --> 02:52:10,840
And then somebody just shook it like an 
etch a sketch or climate change.

3868
02:52:10,841 --> 02:52:12,390
That's the real theory,
really.

3869
02:52:12,430 --> 02:52:17,430
Rehab,
because this is what they're saying 

3870
02:52:17,430 --> 02:52:17,500
about the Nile Valley,
is that before 9,000

3871
02:52:17,501 --> 02:52:20,650
years ago it was our tropical rain 
forest and now it's all.

3872
02:52:21,090 --> 02:52:26,090
It's all sand and desert.
But before that it was like fucking 

3873
02:52:26,090 --> 02:52:28,830
trees and just the climate changes 
whether we fuck with it and make a 

3874
02:52:28,830 --> 02:52:30,280
change faster or not.
It's not stable.

3875
02:52:30,310 --> 02:52:32,770
It's constantly going up and down,
you know,

3876
02:52:32,771 --> 02:52:37,771
and so this is probably also partially 
responsible for what happened to those 

3877
02:52:37,771 --> 02:52:40,921
people,
but those people had taken shit to a 

3878
02:52:40,921 --> 02:52:42,460
another level man more so they need to 
go there and give them.

3879
02:52:42,460 --> 02:52:47,460
Because I've only been watching dvds and
I'm scared of going to Egypt because 

3880
02:52:47,460 --> 02:52:49,510
it's sometimes it's a little unstable,
but man,

3881
02:52:49,511 --> 02:52:54,511
what it must be like to see these 4,000
fucking year old gigantic stone 

3882
02:52:54,701 --> 02:52:59,701
structures that were cut and moved by.
Who knows how many people and who knows 

3883
02:52:59,701 --> 02:53:02,050
how the fuck they did it.
They just have theories.

3884
02:53:02,170 --> 02:53:04,480
There's just guesses.
They don't know.

3885
02:53:05,020 --> 02:53:07,240
There's no hieroglyphic wall that's 
like,

3886
02:53:07,241 --> 02:53:09,010
here's the real story.
Not really.

3887
02:53:09,011 --> 02:53:14,011
I mean the problem was they think that a
lot of the information was in the 

3888
02:53:14,011 --> 02:53:14,110
library of Alexandria was written down 
there,

3889
02:53:14,111 --> 02:53:19,111
was burned when they were conquered,
so they don't really know.

3890
02:53:20,260 --> 02:53:22,720
Don't really know how they made them.
There's a lot of good guesses.

3891
02:53:22,770 --> 02:53:24,730
A lot of good theories,
but fuck,

3892
02:53:24,731 --> 02:53:29,731
you're talking about millions of stones 
and they're huge and like how long did 

3893
02:53:29,731 --> 02:53:31,810
this take?
They say if you cut in place 10 of those

3894
02:53:31,811 --> 02:53:36,811
massive stones a day,
it would take you 664 years to make the 

3895
02:53:36,811 --> 02:53:39,260
great pyramid and we're all.

3896
02:53:39,260 --> 02:53:42,640
We know how long it took.
Just what,

3897
02:53:42,820 --> 02:53:44,140
wait a minute.
Say that again.

3898
02:53:44,470 --> 02:53:49,000
10 of those massive stones a day.
It would take you 600,

3899
02:53:49,001 --> 02:53:52,630
64 years to build all the great pyramid 
to build just a great parent of Giza.

3900
02:53:52,631 --> 02:53:53,710
Just that.
Just that one.

3901
02:53:53,711 --> 02:53:58,711
Just that one.
So whoever commissioned it certainly 

3902
02:53:58,711 --> 02:54:01,651
wasn't around to see it 100 percent.
Unless they had some wizard magic shit 

3903
02:54:01,651 --> 02:54:03,730
that we're not aware of and they did it 
way quicker than we think they did.

3904
02:54:04,030 --> 02:54:09,030
Well,
who knows how long they it took them to 

3905
02:54:09,030 --> 02:54:09,030
build.
We don't really know.

3906
02:54:09,030 --> 02:54:09,030
It might've been a thousand years,
you know,

3907
02:54:09,030 --> 02:54:13,890
who knows?
Where do you stand on the faith or what 

3908
02:54:13,890 --> 02:54:15,280
happens in your estimation?
We die.

3909
02:54:15,281 --> 02:54:17,710
What happens?
I really don't know.

3910
02:54:17,980 --> 02:54:20,920
And I think in that regard,
I'm right there with everybody.

3911
02:54:21,040 --> 02:54:26,040
I think you can have your ideas and I 
think those ideas can strengthen your 

3912
02:54:26,040 --> 02:54:26,230
resolve in this life and they could even
help you.

3913
02:54:26,560 --> 02:54:28,990
And this is something that I had to 
accept as I got older.

3914
02:54:29,020 --> 02:54:30,100
More of the same thing.
Like,

3915
02:54:30,101 --> 02:54:32,740
okay,
why do I have this reaction?

3916
02:54:32,770 --> 02:54:33,880
Like there's certain people that are 
like,

3917
02:54:33,881 --> 02:54:35,370
these ardent atheist,
they're like,

3918
02:54:35,380 --> 02:54:36,880
God is dead.
There's no god.

3919
02:54:36,881 --> 02:54:38,080
Shut the fuck up.
And like,

3920
02:54:38,081 --> 02:54:40,990
okay,
how do you know?

3921
02:54:41,050 --> 02:54:45,010
You don't know.
So even though logic would point,

3922
02:54:45,050 --> 02:54:48,670
I mean if you really paid attention to 
the way human beings tell stories,

3923
02:54:48,671 --> 02:54:53,671
you would have to say,
well a lot of these religious stories 

3924
02:54:53,671 --> 02:54:54,550
are probably fabricated.
Or maybe there was an initial message or

3925
02:54:54,551 --> 02:54:57,910
maybe there was some wisdom that these 
people initially stumbled upon.

3926
02:54:57,911 --> 02:55:02,911
They wanted to document it.
But whether or not all this came from 

3927
02:55:02,911 --> 02:55:02,911
God,
you know,

3928
02:55:02,911 --> 02:55:04,580
the Cain and Abel Shit and trying to 
trick a brother and to kill.

3929
02:55:04,581 --> 02:55:06,130
And another brother like,
oh,

3930
02:55:06,131 --> 02:55:06,940
I almost got ya.

3931
02:55:07,070 --> 02:55:08,300
You know,
you got to do it for me.

3932
02:55:08,480 --> 02:55:09,640
You're my boy.
You're gonna.

3933
02:55:09,660 --> 02:55:10,880
Kill your brother.
Thanks man.

3934
02:55:11,060 --> 02:55:16,060
Or this is so many of those stories that
was a little more human than it's way 

3935
02:55:16,060 --> 02:55:16,060
more godlike.
Yeah.

3936
02:55:16,060 --> 02:55:17,330
But does that mean there's No God?
No,

3937
02:55:17,331 --> 02:55:19,110
of course it doesn't.
It doesn't do this.

3938
02:55:19,190 --> 02:55:24,190
This universe is too bizarre for you to 
leave anything off the table.

3939
02:55:24,830 --> 02:55:26,950
Any,
any possibilities of,

3940
02:55:27,010 --> 02:55:28,820
of what,
what created it,

3941
02:55:28,821 --> 02:55:31,730
what sustains it other than scientific,
you know,

3942
02:55:31,790 --> 02:55:36,790
you get down to like the,
the most reductionist perspective of 

3943
02:55:36,790 --> 02:55:41,681
it's just a series of quarks and gluons 
and Adams and an energy and maybe maybe 

3944
02:55:43,641 --> 02:55:45,140
it is all that.
Maybe it is just that,

3945
02:55:45,141 --> 02:55:50,141
but maybe that in itself is God.
Maybe God is not a material thing,

3946
02:55:50,241 --> 02:55:52,820
but it's a creating force of the entire 
universe itself.

3947
02:55:52,821 --> 02:55:54,890
And it also has good in its heart.

3948
02:55:55,160 --> 02:56:00,160
Like maybe the reason why we love like 
hugs and good conversation and,

3949
02:56:00,321 --> 02:56:05,321
and you know,
a cute puppy and all these different 

3950
02:56:05,321 --> 02:56:07,361
things we like love and we'd like 
happiness because all these things are 

3951
02:56:07,361 --> 02:56:10,841
powerful forces in the universe and all 
these things represent the greater will 

3952
02:56:10,841 --> 02:56:15,560
have the creator of whatever it is that 
makes this universe so spectacular.

3953
02:56:15,561 --> 02:56:18,110
Whatever the fuck that is,
I don't know what it is,

3954
02:56:18,410 --> 02:56:21,050
but anybody who says they know what it 
is is lying.

3955
02:56:21,740 --> 02:56:26,740
You're lying.
You're trying to trick people so that 

3956
02:56:26,740 --> 02:56:29,321
you have the ultimate truth and they 
don't and that's how we control people 

3957
02:56:29,321 --> 02:56:31,130
and that's fine.
Up until around now it's fine.

3958
02:56:31,220 --> 02:56:33,740
When there was no internet,
it's fine with books were scarce.

3959
02:56:33,830 --> 02:56:35,630
It's fine.
When we had to keep order,

3960
02:56:35,631 --> 02:56:36,680
it's fine,
it's fine,

3961
02:56:36,830 --> 02:56:39,200
but it's not fun anymore because we know
too much now,

3962
02:56:39,290 --> 02:56:43,550
so it doesn't mean that there's no god,
but it means you definitely.

3963
02:56:43,550 --> 02:56:45,590
This guy that wants the jet,
who's that?

3964
02:56:45,591 --> 02:56:47,890
It's televangelists that wants 
$50,000,000

3965
02:56:47,900 --> 02:56:51,710
to buy his own private jet for sure.
That guy's full of shit.

3966
02:56:52,090 --> 02:56:55,630
See,
there's like things that we can and it's

3967
02:56:55,640 --> 02:56:57,500
not even original hustle.
It's like,

3968
02:56:57,501 --> 02:56:59,510
I know what happens after this.
Give me your money.

3969
02:56:59,540 --> 02:57:01,430
God wants me to be wealthy.
That's what he's saying.

3970
02:57:01,520 --> 02:57:06,520
St.
Do you ever experienced the afterlife 

3971
02:57:06,520 --> 02:57:08,210
yet?
I've met people that it.

3972
02:57:08,211 --> 02:57:13,211
My belief is that a lot of that can be 
attributed to the chemicals that your 

3973
02:57:13,211 --> 02:57:15,170
brain is capable of producing.
On a regular basis,

3974
02:57:15,171 --> 02:57:20,171
it does while you're sleeping,
it does what you're into periods of 

3975
02:57:20,171 --> 02:57:20,171
extreme stress,
you know,

3976
02:57:20,171 --> 02:57:24,311
and that all of these different 
chemicals most likely are released in 

3977
02:57:24,311 --> 02:57:28,151
the brain during these overwhelming 
periods of anxiety and fear and terror 

3978
02:57:28,761 --> 02:57:31,050
and injury.
And when your body is thinking,

3979
02:57:31,130 --> 02:57:32,330
Hey,
this might be it,

3980
02:57:32,750 --> 02:57:37,750
you know,
and I think that's probably what a lot 

3981
02:57:37,750 --> 02:57:39,260
of these near death experiences are,
is that people are experiencing what you

3982
02:57:39,261 --> 02:57:44,261
would call an endogenous psychedelic 
experience that your brain is releasing 

3983
02:57:44,261 --> 02:57:46,310
these potent chemicals that it has.

3984
02:57:46,550 --> 02:57:51,550
It absolutely has inside of it.
Your brain has a ton of different things

3985
02:57:51,741 --> 02:57:54,710
like dimethyltryptamine and different 
psychedelic chemicals.

3986
02:57:54,711 --> 02:57:56,960
It's capable of producing as well as 
Melatonin,

3987
02:57:56,961 --> 02:57:58,250
dopamine,
Serotonin,

3988
02:57:58,430 --> 02:57:59,720
adrenaline,
cortisol.

3989
02:57:59,730 --> 02:58:04,730
There's here's a fucking storm of shit 
going on in your brain and in the moment

3990
02:58:05,041 --> 02:58:05,520
like,
yeah,

3991
02:58:05,620 --> 02:58:10,620
a moment like Jack's it all out,
pumps it through your fucking neurons 

3992
02:58:10,861 --> 02:58:15,861
and everything's firing and you're 
seeing things that aren't there and 

3993
02:58:15,861 --> 02:58:18,891
you're talking to dead relatives.
Your imagine the pearly gates and your 

3994
02:58:18,891 --> 02:58:20,310
imagination is on 10 and you just see 
it.

3995
02:58:20,311 --> 02:58:23,040
Everything.
That's the reductionist perspective.

3996
02:58:23,490 --> 02:58:24,210
The,
the,

3997
02:58:24,240 --> 02:58:29,240
the hopeful,
optimistic spiritual woo perspective is 

3998
02:58:29,240 --> 02:58:33,410
this is a chemical gateway and you're 
seeing through the door of the other 

3999
02:58:33,410 --> 02:58:35,010
side and then when they decide it's not 
your time yet,

4000
02:58:35,280 --> 02:58:40,280
you're sucked back to where you lie and 
then you're allowed to resume this life 

4001
02:58:40,591 --> 02:58:45,591
because you have more work to do and 
that's the perspective that a lot of 

4002
02:58:45,591 --> 02:58:45,591
people feel when they come out of those 
experiences.

4003
02:58:45,591 --> 02:58:46,740
Right?
They feel like I have more work to do.

4004
02:58:46,741 --> 02:58:47,580
I can't stop now.

4005
02:58:47,940 --> 02:58:50,280
My mom,
years ago,

4006
02:58:50,340 --> 02:58:51,570
guys,
like 10 years ago,

4007
02:58:51,630 --> 02:58:53,790
more than that,
even moved 15 years ago at this point,

4008
02:58:53,800 --> 02:58:57,120
I had a heart attack or a heart episode 
rather.

4009
02:58:57,121 --> 02:59:02,121
My Dad died of a heart attack,
but my mom was on the table and they 

4010
02:59:02,121 --> 02:59:05,121
were putting a stent into her heart,
into an artery and she was sitting there

4011
02:59:05,510 --> 02:59:07,920
chitchatting while they were doing the 
surgery.

4012
02:59:07,921 --> 02:59:10,110
I guess she was on a local more so than 
anything else.

4013
02:59:10,920 --> 02:59:12,810
And uh,
she was joking around with the doctor.

4014
02:59:12,811 --> 02:59:14,170
She's like,
Eric got hurry up doc,

4015
02:59:14,190 --> 02:59:18,710
because I got to pickup my mom for the.
And then went out well on.

4016
02:59:18,760 --> 02:59:22,160
So she died for a minute and a half 
clinically fucking dead,

4017
02:59:22,210 --> 02:59:26,580
that fucking try to restart the art.
So I was like,

4018
02:59:26,581 --> 02:59:27,630
what,
what,

4019
02:59:27,631 --> 02:59:29,490
just what happened?
What was it?

4020
02:59:30,510 --> 02:59:32,580
And she didn't.
She said,

4021
02:59:32,610 --> 02:59:34,740
you know,
she didn't describe a guy saw the bright

4022
02:59:34,741 --> 02:59:36,510
lights and I saw people and Blah,
blah blah.

4023
02:59:37,380 --> 02:59:40,020
She said I was floating and I was like,
floating up.

4024
02:59:40,021 --> 02:59:41,760
She goes,
no floating on my back.

4025
02:59:42,240 --> 02:59:43,230
It's like,
okay,

4026
02:59:43,231 --> 02:59:45,240
while you were on your back in the 
hospital,

4027
02:59:45,390 --> 02:59:46,950
do you think that's what it was?
She's like,

4028
02:59:47,610 --> 02:59:48,610
I don't know,
but this is,

4029
02:59:48,960 --> 02:59:53,960
this is what I remember.
Every iota of responsibility I ever felt

4030
02:59:56,311 --> 02:59:58,920
in my life was gone.
She's like,

4031
02:59:58,921 --> 03:00:03,921
I felt free.
I felt instantly lighter and just as I 

4032
03:00:06,151 --> 03:00:11,151
was heading in a direction,
that's when like they pulled her back so

4033
03:00:12,151 --> 03:00:14,300
she'd been dead for like a minute and a 
half hearted stuff.

4034
03:00:14,790 --> 03:00:15,720
So I was like,
all right,

4035
03:00:17,310 --> 03:00:21,750
you been in this best of all possible 
worlds for fucking 60 plus years.

4036
03:00:22,350 --> 03:00:25,680
Now you've seen a glimpse of the other 
side,

4037
03:00:26,040 --> 03:00:31,040
which is better.
And my mom said the other side and I 

4038
03:00:31,040 --> 03:00:31,040
said,
what?

4039
03:00:31,040 --> 03:00:31,920
What you were there for like a minute 
and change why?

4040
03:00:32,550 --> 03:00:35,910
And she said I was completely fucking 
free.

4041
03:00:36,750 --> 03:00:38,820
Like that was it.
I didn't.

4042
03:00:38,821 --> 03:00:41,670
I didn't know this one.
I don't have to care for this one.

4043
03:00:41,700 --> 03:00:43,370
I don't have to make sure this doesn't 
take care of it.

4044
03:00:43,380 --> 03:00:45,020
I have to feed the cat.
She was like,

4045
03:00:45,060 --> 03:00:47,150
it was bliss.
She's like in.

4046
03:00:47,151 --> 03:00:49,620
If that's what happens,
then I look forward to that again.

4047
03:00:49,920 --> 03:00:54,300
So when I have my shit three months ago 
and the doctor was like,

4048
03:00:54,301 --> 03:00:59,301
you got a 20 percent chance to live in.
I was sitting there going through all 

4049
03:00:59,301 --> 03:01:00,580
the fucking shit in my head about like,
all right,

4050
03:01:00,581 --> 03:01:02,020
well this is it.
You're a fucking.

4051
03:01:02,021 --> 03:01:04,210
You've spent your life with your head up
your ass,

4052
03:01:04,260 --> 03:01:09,260
you know,
fucking trying to figure out who you 

4053
03:01:09,260 --> 03:01:09,260
are.
Go ahead,

4054
03:01:09,260 --> 03:01:09,550
look at your head and heart.
What is your.

4055
03:01:09,551 --> 03:01:10,900
This is it.
This is the big moment.

4056
03:01:10,930 --> 03:01:12,460
Like what are your thoughts?
What's going through?

4057
03:01:12,640 --> 03:01:14,770
And now Dina,
I'm such a chicken shit in live.

4058
03:01:14,771 --> 03:01:16,750
I assume that I'd be like,
the guy was like,

4059
03:01:16,751 --> 03:01:20,200
I'll fucking suck your dick to stay in 
this life because I know this live and I

4060
03:01:20,201 --> 03:01:21,910
don't know what happens afterwards and 
stuff.

4061
03:01:22,480 --> 03:01:24,860
So I thought I'd be begging for,
you know,

4062
03:01:25,090 --> 03:01:26,920
for help from God or something like 
that.

4063
03:01:26,921 --> 03:01:27,970
But I was like,
I made dog,

4064
03:01:27,971 --> 03:01:29,590
but I'm sure Jesus would be like,
go to hell.

4065
03:01:29,591 --> 03:01:33,090
Fuck you buddy Christ my ass.
So instead of doing the Gi,

4066
03:01:33,130 --> 03:01:38,130
the religious thing,
I started thinking about just the 

4067
03:01:38,130 --> 03:01:38,770
journey itself.
I was like,

4068
03:01:38,771 --> 03:01:39,820
well,
if the journey is ending,

4069
03:01:41,410 --> 03:01:46,410
what are your thoughts?
Just like when the day held up the 

4070
03:01:46,410 --> 03:01:46,410
phone,
they were like,

4071
03:01:46,410 --> 03:01:46,480
do you want to talk to your wife?
And I was like,

4072
03:01:46,481 --> 03:01:49,780
I know,
of course I did,

4073
03:01:50,470 --> 03:01:54,000
but I didn't want to because I was like,
I know in my heart of hearts finance,

4074
03:01:54,010 --> 03:01:57,810
if I speak to my wife right now,
I'm going to be in the 21st.

4075
03:01:57,850 --> 03:01:59,680
I'm going to die.
Had been the 80 percent,

4076
03:01:59,710 --> 03:02:03,270
I'm going to fucking drop dead because 
that's the intensity of it.

4077
03:02:03,940 --> 03:02:05,440
Not even like,
oh my God,

4078
03:02:05,441 --> 03:02:08,020
it's killing it.
It just the way they were,

4079
03:02:08,021 --> 03:02:10,900
so like,
do you want your wife is on the phone,

4080
03:02:11,110 --> 03:02:16,110
do you want to speak to her right now?
Was very leading and you know,

4081
03:02:16,510 --> 03:02:21,510
they're professionals and these cats 
deal with life and death every day and 

4082
03:02:21,510 --> 03:02:23,170
this was my first experience with it.
So what I got out of it was you probably

4083
03:02:23,171 --> 03:02:26,650
going to die.
It was what they felt and it's still,

4084
03:02:26,651 --> 03:02:31,651
I was in the state of like,
I didn't even realize I was having a 

4085
03:02:31,651 --> 03:02:31,930
heart attack and so I remember looking 
at the phone and being like,

4086
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:34,400
I'm,
if I answered,

4087
03:02:34,430 --> 03:02:35,960
if I talked to Jennifer,
that's going to be,

4088
03:02:36,020 --> 03:02:38,230
I'm not going to leave this room.
So I was like,

4089
03:02:38,260 --> 03:02:40,690
I'm going to play the odds if I don't 
talk to Jennifer.

4090
03:02:41,380 --> 03:02:43,010
Maybe there's some part of me that's 
like,

4091
03:02:43,050 --> 03:02:44,230
look,
I like talking to Jennifer.

4092
03:02:44,231 --> 03:02:47,290
We've been together 20 years.
I better enjoy talking to Jennifer.

4093
03:02:48,220 --> 03:02:51,520
Maybe if I put this phone call off,
you know,

4094
03:02:51,790 --> 03:02:54,700
they don't get to talk to Jennifer when 
it's all fucking done.

4095
03:02:54,701 --> 03:02:56,020
So I said to the dude,
I was like,

4096
03:02:56,021 --> 03:02:58,960
you know what?
Tell our our color back and the guy goes

4097
03:02:58,961 --> 03:03:00,100
seriously.
And I was like,

4098
03:03:00,101 --> 03:03:02,760
yeah.
And I saw him talking and got a phone.

4099
03:03:02,761 --> 03:03:03,190
I was like,
what?

4100
03:03:03,191 --> 03:03:03,850
She said,
he goes,

4101
03:03:03,851 --> 03:03:06,460
she was fucking pissed dude.
And I was like,

4102
03:03:06,461 --> 03:03:08,500
wow,
I'm dealing with my own shit right now.

4103
03:03:08,800 --> 03:03:13,800
So I was laying there on the table and I
was like going through my life and I was

4104
03:03:14,141 --> 03:03:16,750
more grateful than anything else.
It wasn't scared anymore.

4105
03:03:16,751 --> 03:03:19,270
That was the thing as the love thing 
that I love to communicate.

4106
03:03:19,890 --> 03:03:22,390
Spent my whole life terrified a fucking 
dying.

4107
03:03:23,380 --> 03:03:28,380
And when I was closest to it as I ever 
knew I was and for all I know I was 

4108
03:03:28,811 --> 03:03:31,450
closer to someplace but like I was 
cognizant,

4109
03:03:31,630 --> 03:03:35,290
been told by a professional,
this is fucking risky.

4110
03:03:36,850 --> 03:03:39,850
I was just Kinda,
I was grateful more than anything else.

4111
03:03:39,851 --> 03:03:41,680
I was like,
what a fucking journey.

4112
03:03:41,800 --> 03:03:43,990
Like yeah,
and I'm 47 and it seems short,

4113
03:03:43,991 --> 03:03:48,400
but fucking like you gotTa admit you did
more than fucking most people get to do.

4114
03:03:48,401 --> 03:03:53,401
And maybe that's why it happened at an 
early age because you weren't going to 

4115
03:03:53,401 --> 03:03:53,401
get the rest of this time and shit like 
that.

4116
03:03:53,710 --> 03:03:56,710
But like I wasn't mad.
I wasn't like fucking wise.

4117
03:03:56,730 --> 03:03:59,580
This is unfair.
I remembered like a,

4118
03:03:59,581 --> 03:04:04,581
there's a issue of Sandman,
which I absolutely love Neil Gaiman's 

4119
03:04:04,581 --> 03:04:06,350
comic book series back in the day.
And uh,

4120
03:04:06,351 --> 03:04:07,130
in,
in,

4121
03:04:07,131 --> 03:04:09,920
like after the first story arc,
he,

4122
03:04:10,020 --> 03:04:13,820
we meet his sister,
the main character's dream,

4123
03:04:13,821 --> 03:04:18,821
morpheus,
character of dream is part of the 

4124
03:04:18,821 --> 03:04:18,821
endless.

4125
03:04:18,821 --> 03:04:20,210
And he's got two other siblings,
delirium,

4126
03:04:20,211 --> 03:04:21,800
desire,
one of his siblings,

4127
03:04:21,801 --> 03:04:25,040
his death and they represent death.
And the comic book,

4128
03:04:25,520 --> 03:04:30,520
you know,
you're used to seeing the fucking sky 

4129
03:04:30,520 --> 03:04:31,130
than the fucking grim reaper and shit.
She's the little,

4130
03:04:31,150 --> 03:04:33,410
uh,
emo girl,

4131
03:04:33,411 --> 03:04:36,170
goth girl wearing a knock around her 
neck and shit like that.

4132
03:04:36,171 --> 03:04:41,171
It was written in the nineties and they 
don't tell you right away that she's 

4133
03:04:41,171 --> 03:04:41,171
death.
As you're reading the issue,

4134
03:04:41,171 --> 03:04:41,480
you're like,
oh shit,

4135
03:04:41,690 --> 03:04:46,690
I think she's meant to be death.
She's fairing soles over to the other 

4136
03:04:46,690 --> 03:04:49,811
side.
You see a baby passed and she's holding 

4137
03:04:49,811 --> 03:04:49,811
the baby.
And then there's the,

4138
03:04:49,811 --> 03:04:50,780
the,
the refrain is like the,

4139
03:04:50,830 --> 03:04:55,830
I hear the sound of her wings and that's
taking this soul over to the next place 

4140
03:04:55,830 --> 03:04:57,740
as she's sitting around talking to her 
brother.

4141
03:04:58,550 --> 03:05:03,550
And so she,
she eventually gets into a room with 

4142
03:05:03,550 --> 03:05:03,770
this older guy,
um,

4143
03:05:03,860 --> 03:05:05,150
who's like,
who are you?

4144
03:05:05,150 --> 03:05:05,810
And,
and you know,

4145
03:05:05,811 --> 03:05:07,070
she's like,
I'm here for you.

4146
03:05:07,071 --> 03:05:07,650
You know,
I am.

4147
03:05:07,651 --> 03:05:08,630
And he's like,
that's it.

4148
03:05:09,050 --> 03:05:10,130
He's like,
oh my God,

4149
03:05:10,131 --> 03:05:13,520
I did all these things.
I worked my fingers to the bone and what

4150
03:05:13,521 --> 03:05:14,930
did I get?
This is at,

4151
03:05:14,960 --> 03:05:16,610
what did I get?
And she says,

4152
03:05:16,640 --> 03:05:18,950
you align that.
When I read it,

4153
03:05:18,951 --> 03:05:20,600
when I was 18,
it was powerful.

4154
03:05:20,601 --> 03:05:22,310
But when I was laying on the fucking 
table,

4155
03:05:22,640 --> 03:05:27,110
it was constantly going through my head 
and made it all easier.

4156
03:05:27,140 --> 03:05:28,940
Made me kind of at peace with the idea 
of dying.

4157
03:05:29,540 --> 03:05:31,280
There's this line,
she says to the guy,

4158
03:05:31,281 --> 03:05:32,060
she goes,
you get,

4159
03:05:32,150 --> 03:05:34,190
you got what everybody gets.
You've got a lifetime.

4160
03:05:34,760 --> 03:05:36,050
And as I was laying there,
I was like,

4161
03:05:36,051 --> 03:05:37,370
oh my God,
I got a lifetime.

4162
03:05:37,371 --> 03:05:39,200
Like that's,
that's what it was.

4163
03:05:39,230 --> 03:05:44,230
Nothing more.
Nothing fucking less than I did some 

4164
03:05:44,230 --> 03:05:46,691
shit in it and now it's going to stop 
and people are going to go on without 

4165
03:05:46,691 --> 03:05:46,691
you.

4166
03:05:46,691 --> 03:05:49,910
And that's not terrible.
Like I,

4167
03:05:49,911 --> 03:05:54,911
I thought I'd be fucking desperate to 
live and instead I had that weird s like

4168
03:05:55,400 --> 03:05:57,410
Sam,
I understood what my mother said for the

4169
03:05:57,411 --> 03:05:59,450
first time because I was laying there.
I was like,

4170
03:05:59,480 --> 03:06:01,310
oh my God.
Like I made it to the end,

4171
03:06:01,550 --> 03:06:03,290
like this is it,
this is the finish line.

4172
03:06:03,291 --> 03:06:06,320
And it had been something that I was 
terrified of ever getting to.

4173
03:06:06,590 --> 03:06:08,330
But then when really kind of faced with 
it,

4174
03:06:08,331 --> 03:06:09,620
I was like,
oh,

4175
03:06:10,040 --> 03:06:13,040
like I'm done.
Like I'm not scared that I'm done.

4176
03:06:13,310 --> 03:06:16,310
I'm actually kind of relieved that I'm 
done and like,

4177
03:06:16,400 --> 03:06:21,400
you know,
fucking like I didn't get killed and I 

4178
03:06:21,400 --> 03:06:22,010
wasn't home,
invaded a shark,

4179
03:06:22,011 --> 03:06:23,360
didn't eat me.
Um,

4180
03:06:23,630 --> 03:06:26,840
all the things that like I've been 
terrified of my entire life,

4181
03:06:27,350 --> 03:06:29,030
like I don't have to think about 
anymore.

4182
03:06:29,031 --> 03:06:32,030
I made it to the end and it's kind of 
okay.

4183
03:06:32,450 --> 03:06:34,370
So it's weird.
My whole life I thought like,

4184
03:06:34,430 --> 03:06:39,430
you know,
I'd be scared to death and most people 

4185
03:06:39,430 --> 03:06:41,201
we all are,
we're all terrified of fucking dying 

4186
03:06:41,201 --> 03:06:41,201
because we don't know,
but that's the closest I ever came and I

4187
03:06:41,201 --> 03:06:45,821
wasn't scared.
Like suddenly the fear just went away 

4188
03:06:45,821 --> 03:06:46,800
and it seemed logical.
Like of course it's over like things end

4189
03:06:46,910 --> 03:06:49,070
and I didn't want to die.
I wasn't,

4190
03:06:49,071 --> 03:06:50,690
didn't have a death wish,
but I was like,

4191
03:06:51,250 --> 03:06:53,170
if it's done it's,
it's kind of,

4192
03:06:53,290 --> 03:06:57,420
it's done and count your blessings and 
be happy and don't be a bitch.

4193
03:06:57,421 --> 03:07:02,421
Like don't.
If the fucking fairy man shows up 

4194
03:07:02,421 --> 03:07:02,790
tonight,
don't fucking hold out.

4195
03:07:02,791 --> 03:07:04,500
Don't be the last asshole at the party.
Go.

4196
03:07:04,501 --> 03:07:07,240
No,
like just fucking pay the ferryman.

4197
03:07:07,260 --> 03:07:09,690
Get on a boat and go.
We'll see what's next and stuff.

4198
03:07:10,050 --> 03:07:15,050
And then ultimately in time did a good 
job and I fucking wound up living and 

4199
03:07:15,050 --> 03:07:15,050
stuff.

4200
03:07:15,050 --> 03:07:19,130
So I know this much.
I got to read a bunch of shit like after

4201
03:07:19,231 --> 03:07:24,231
I nearly died and it was all nice.
People wrote very nice things about me 

4202
03:07:24,231 --> 03:07:24,231
and shit and I expected,
you know,

4203
03:07:24,231 --> 03:07:25,920
the creature of the Internet that some 
people would be like,

4204
03:07:25,921 --> 03:07:28,350
I wish he had fucking died,
fuck them to death and shit.

4205
03:07:28,590 --> 03:07:33,590
I wish he'd stay silent,
but generally it was like very nice 

4206
03:07:33,590 --> 03:07:34,080
things.
People were kind of positive and stuff.

4207
03:07:34,710 --> 03:07:36,210
So I was like,
fuck man.

4208
03:07:36,211 --> 03:07:38,910
Like,
you know,

4209
03:07:39,600 --> 03:07:40,950
again,
I didn't want to die,

4210
03:07:40,951 --> 03:07:45,180
but like if I had like,
that would've been okay,

4211
03:07:45,181 --> 03:07:47,130
now I'm back at it.
You know what I'm saying?

4212
03:07:47,131 --> 03:07:51,720
Like now until it ends,
like I've got a,

4213
03:07:52,350 --> 03:07:57,350
you know,
and it's kind of easy as long as they 

4214
03:07:57,350 --> 03:07:57,480
don't wake up with a fucking dead girl 
are alive boy,

4215
03:07:57,481 --> 03:08:02,481
I don't think like they'll fucking broke
me over the coals when I die in the 

4216
03:08:02,481 --> 03:08:02,481
future and shit like that.

4217
03:08:02,940 --> 03:08:06,000
But it felt weird to be so close to the 
completion.

4218
03:08:06,001 --> 03:08:10,050
And so having something that normally 
terrifies you suddenly be like,

4219
03:08:10,080 --> 03:08:11,070
oh,
it's okay.

4220
03:08:11,430 --> 03:08:16,430
Like,
and I don't if you walked up and put a 

4221
03:08:16,430 --> 03:08:16,620
gun in my face,
I'm sure I'd feel threatened,

4222
03:08:16,621 --> 03:08:20,100
but like,
I kinda lost my fear of death.

4223
03:08:20,101 --> 03:08:25,101
I'm not like death defying,
I won't go out and do anything 

4224
03:08:25,101 --> 03:08:25,101
differently,
but that,

4225
03:08:25,440 --> 03:08:28,530
that dark cloud that kind of kills any 
good time.

4226
03:08:28,531 --> 03:08:31,650
The moment you start thinking about like
the fear and anxiety you're going to die

4227
03:08:31,651 --> 03:08:34,560
one day like you know it's gone and I 
will send them like,

4228
03:08:34,561 --> 03:08:39,561
yeah,
I'm going to die one day and it's going 

4229
03:08:39,561 --> 03:08:41,221
to be awesome,
but not for the reasons that you think 

4230
03:08:41,221 --> 03:08:41,221
I'm saying it's gonna.
Be Awesome.

4231
03:08:41,221 --> 03:08:43,020
Just be awesome because a finish like 
it's nice to finish things.

4232
03:08:43,021 --> 03:08:48,021
We know how good it feels in life to 
complete something and that's the 

4233
03:08:48,021 --> 03:08:49,200
biggest fucking thing in life you'll 
ever complete is your journey.

4234
03:08:49,650 --> 03:08:53,790
So I didn't walk away going,
I got to do more.

4235
03:08:53,820 --> 03:08:56,220
Like I got to fucking live life to the 
fullest.

4236
03:08:56,490 --> 03:08:58,680
I just got to keep doing what I've been 
doing,

4237
03:08:58,830 --> 03:09:02,670
like living life the way I enjoy it,
trying to do things.

4238
03:09:02,671 --> 03:09:04,740
Sometimes they work,
sometimes they fail and Shit.

4239
03:09:04,980 --> 03:09:09,980
Sometimes people are on your side,
sometimes people are you fucking blow 

4240
03:09:09,980 --> 03:09:13,050
and just do that fucking time.
Have good conversations in the process.

4241
03:09:13,051 --> 03:09:18,051
Meet interesting people here,
new points of view and shit like that 

4242
03:09:18,051 --> 03:09:21,630
and keep at it,
but it's nothing to be afraid of.

4243
03:09:22,680 --> 03:09:24,570
Like,
I don't want to get eaten by a cat.

4244
03:09:24,571 --> 03:09:26,730
Don't get me wrong.
Like I guarantee you,

4245
03:09:26,940 --> 03:09:30,270
I would not be philosophical as a 
fucking big cat was crushing my,

4246
03:09:30,370 --> 03:09:30,930
you know,
I'd be like,

4247
03:09:30,970 --> 03:09:31,820
Jesus,
no,

4248
03:09:31,821 --> 03:09:36,821
I find prayer quick,
but death is no longer something.

4249
03:09:38,310 --> 03:09:41,610
I'm not looking for it and I certainly 
won't put myself in harm's way,

4250
03:09:41,611 --> 03:09:46,611
but it doesn't preoccupy me anymore.
I've been there and it's not the thing 

4251
03:09:46,741 --> 03:09:49,650
that I was led to believe.
It was like,

4252
03:09:49,651 --> 03:09:51,230
it's not the,
the,

4253
03:09:51,520 --> 03:09:54,280
the ultimate fear come true.
It's not the grim reaper.

4254
03:09:54,310 --> 03:09:56,410
There's a sense,
at least in my case,

4255
03:09:56,590 --> 03:09:58,420
and again,
I didn't have a painful heart attack.

4256
03:09:58,421 --> 03:10:03,421
I'm sure people have heart attacks where
they feel like they're fucking bodies 

4257
03:10:03,421 --> 03:10:06,130
being ripped and cleaved in twain,
but it wasn't.

4258
03:10:06,930 --> 03:10:08,320
It wasn't that.
It wasn't scary.

4259
03:10:08,380 --> 03:10:09,040
It was,
okay,

4260
03:10:09,970 --> 03:10:14,970
well listen man,
I'm glad you lived because I love you 

4261
03:10:14,970 --> 03:10:14,970
and you were one of my favorite things 
to do.

4262
03:10:15,730 --> 03:10:18,280
I always love it and after the heart 
attack I couldn't wait to.

4263
03:10:18,390 --> 03:10:19,900
We started texting and be like,
Bro,

4264
03:10:19,901 --> 03:10:20,630
you got to come in.
I was like,

4265
03:10:20,660 --> 03:10:22,600
definitely.
I didn't want to ask.

4266
03:10:22,601 --> 03:10:27,601
Quick Protocol goes like that so more,
but listen man,

4267
03:10:28,271 --> 03:10:30,360
you might not make it.
Can you think you can get in here?

4268
03:10:31,300 --> 03:10:32,620
Yeah,
but no,

4269
03:10:32,630 --> 03:10:37,630
I was happy to be here and stuff as well
as as we all are happy to be above 

4270
03:10:37,630 --> 03:10:38,410
ground.
It's better than below.

4271
03:10:38,420 --> 03:10:43,420
Grab your perspective to really because 
you're a seeker as well and it means a 

4272
03:10:43,991 --> 03:10:48,991
lot to a lot of people that are 
listening to because that's what 

4273
03:10:48,991 --> 03:10:48,991
everyone's scared of,
right?

4274
03:10:48,991 --> 03:10:48,991
Oh,
blows everyone's scared of the ride,

4275
03:10:48,991 --> 03:10:53,641
but you know,
that's what we think we're trained to 

4276
03:10:53,641 --> 03:10:53,641
think that way.
Every fucking movie,

4277
03:10:53,641 --> 03:10:57,991
every book you read,
every song is about like how it'll suck 

4278
03:10:57,991 --> 03:10:58,150
when it's over and,
and that fear can keep you from enjoying

4279
03:10:58,151 --> 03:11:01,090
it while you were living and try and 
cool things and stuff like that.

4280
03:11:01,230 --> 03:11:03,970
I don't mean like putting yourself in 
harm's way like let's shoot a movie with

4281
03:11:03,971 --> 03:11:06,700
real lions.
That's been done.

4282
03:11:06,701 --> 03:11:08,230
Don't try.
Go watch the video,

4283
03:11:08,231 --> 03:11:12,040
but the things where you're like,
I'd really like to try it like a fucking

4284
03:11:12,041 --> 03:11:12,880
won't work,
or Ah,

4285
03:11:12,881 --> 03:11:16,150
there's maybe time later as the one 
thing I did walk away from it,

4286
03:11:16,151 --> 03:11:18,160
like time.

4287
03:11:18,520 --> 03:11:20,920
You're fucking lucky for every goddamn 
sec,

4288
03:11:20,950 --> 03:11:24,460
every God second.
So use it wisely and think,

4289
03:11:24,461 --> 03:11:26,470
and I think if you could just think that
way,

4290
03:11:26,471 --> 03:11:29,140
like today's a borrowed debt,
you know,

4291
03:11:29,141 --> 03:11:34,141
you'll have.
Sometimes you have to trick yourself 

4292
03:11:34,141 --> 03:11:36,990
into like finding more enthusiasm.
You have to trick yourself to be pumped 

4293
03:11:36,990 --> 03:11:38,680
up about stuff.
But if you can really do that and,

4294
03:11:38,681 --> 03:11:43,681
and,
and exercise those patterns in your 

4295
03:11:43,681 --> 03:11:43,681
brain and get them normal.
There's,

4296
03:11:43,681 --> 03:11:48,000
there's people that have trick 
themselves into enjoying all sorts of 

4297
03:11:48,000 --> 03:11:51,211
things that they know are good for them.
They just fire up those fucking 

4298
03:11:51,211 --> 03:11:54,961
chemicals.
And today we're going to just go out 

4299
03:11:54,961 --> 03:11:54,961
there and attack this day because this 
is a gift.

4300
03:11:55,300 --> 03:11:57,190
This is,
this isn't supposed to be here.

4301
03:11:57,191 --> 03:11:59,650
We got one.
I think that all the time now.

4302
03:11:59,651 --> 03:12:04,651
Honestly,
that's like an underlying that goes 

4303
03:12:04,651 --> 03:12:05,980
under almost every thought I have and it
doesn't happen constantly,

4304
03:12:05,981 --> 03:12:08,620
but it literally happens about 10 times 
a week.

4305
03:12:08,980 --> 03:12:10,990
You'll be doing something,
you'll be heading somewhere.

4306
03:12:10,991 --> 03:12:12,910
You'll be eating something fucking 
whatever the fuck,

4307
03:12:12,940 --> 03:12:16,000
fuck in having a conversation and then 
you'll be like,

4308
03:12:16,030 --> 03:12:18,100
this isn't supposed to be happening 
right now.

4309
03:12:18,370 --> 03:12:23,370
A technique based on the odds I was 
supposed to die back on that fucking 

4310
03:12:23,370 --> 03:12:23,370
table.
So suddenly you're like,

4311
03:12:23,370 --> 03:12:25,570
I'm playing on house money,
house money.

4312
03:12:25,571 --> 03:12:27,130
You know what I'm saying?
Have it live a house,

4313
03:12:27,131 --> 03:12:28,150
money life.
Kids,

4314
03:12:28,180 --> 03:12:29,320
live a house,
money,

4315
03:12:29,321 --> 03:12:29,920
life,
kids.

4316
03:12:29,921 --> 03:12:32,690
That should be a fucking tee shirt.
Thank you,

4317
03:12:32,710 --> 03:12:33,760
Kevin.
Excellent.

4318
03:12:33,820 --> 03:12:34,780
I really appreciate you,
brother.

4319
03:12:34,950 --> 03:12:35,620
Appreciate you.

4320
03:12:38,260 --> 03:12:39,360
How many hours.
