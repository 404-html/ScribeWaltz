1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,220
This may transition into a TSA rant and
I apologize if it does cause it's still

3
00:00:05,221 --> 00:00:05,910
fresh in about,

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:06,090
well,

5
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:06,901
we gotta talk about that.

6
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:07,150
Anyway,

7
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,980
the biggest fucking government works
program that's really going on right now.

8
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,020
Our tax dollars going to create a system
to create jobs to demean us and make us

9
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:18,480
feel like criminals for
wanting to take a flight,

10
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,000
a program that is inefficient,

11
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,970
ineffectual by thousands of thousands.

12
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:27,510
That's hyperbole by hundreds of
sorted papers that is inefficient,

13
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:28,344
ineffectual,

14
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,370
that demeans us,

15
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:31,590
that leads to lobbyists in government,

16
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:35,400
kickbacks for these corporations that
make machines that scan us and take nude

17
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:35,820
photos.

18
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,870
This essentially for the folks at me
off for the folks that do the Tsa,

19
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,250
it is a shit job.

20
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,470
You're dealing with people
that don't want to be there.

21
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:47,910
I'm dealing with people that don't
want to comply and in their defense,

22
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,241
look,

23
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:51,570
there's that fucking classic Stanford
study that we've brought up over and over

24
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:54,960
again of what happened when they just
had college students have one person in

25
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:55,950
charge or the ward.

26
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,570
The other person is the prisoner.

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,321
When they,

28
00:00:58,321 --> 00:00:59,041
when you do that,

29
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,900
people abuse Pete Radio and radiation.

30
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,850
It to me is is a moot point.

31
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:03,280
Like,

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:03,541
yeah,

33
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:04,590
I don't think I deserve it.

34
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,090
I don't write this violation.

35
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,320
It's a rights violation.

36
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:09,000
Plus the rapid scan corporation,

37
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:11,430
which was one of the two big
corporations that had like,

38
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:14,340
you know the $70 million contracts
to install these machines,

39
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,510
they were funding Chertoff who was
the ex head of the Homeland Security

40
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:18,511
Administration.

41
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:23,370
Like they've increased their lobbying
five five by like 50% or something since

42
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:25,410
2008 and 2010 that was
the last study I read.

43
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:28,410
So Lord knows how much money
they're spending now to kick.

44
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:32,310
They get kickbacks to people in power
to do these no bid contracts to put in

45
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:33,144
these machines,

46
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,020
which by the way,

47
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,340
most most security and defense experts
tell you that they can actually detect

48
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,320
the plastic explosives that could blow
up at seven 47 like they can't actually

49
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:43,950
detect it.

50
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,960
Plus there was a case in Florida,

51
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:46,980
just not only black,

52
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:47,820
probably two years ago,

53
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,870
where hundreds of thousands of the
photos from people going through those

54
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:53,580
machines because it does store photos,

55
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:54,570
even though it doesn't display them.

56
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,850
Those photos were hacked and it was,

57
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:57,391
they said,

58
00:01:57,391 --> 00:01:58,650
we don't store these photos,

59
00:01:58,651 --> 00:01:59,484
they don't get taken,

60
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,500
but they have a nude
picture of you somewhere.

61
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,630
I think metal detectors are good.

62
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,410
I do.

63
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,630
I think the idea of
checking your bags is good.

64
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:08,400
There's too many cons.

65
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,450
There are certainly,

66
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:12,240
there are certainly there should
be a standard of protection,

67
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:12,750
you know,

68
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,450
metal detector,

69
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,810
how do you want to scan the baggage?

70
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,241
That's fine.

71
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:19,050
But I think we've drawn the line way
too far and we've drawn up the x ray

72
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:21,570
machine in the Austin airport and it's
right next to one of those rapid scan

73
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:22,440
body scanning machines.

74
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:23,274
Right.

75
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,940
And there is a long line for the rapid
scan machine and that's when they say,

76
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,080
oh that lines get long.

77
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,310
Come on through the x rays.

78
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,330
So right away I'm like,

79
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:30,601
you know what?

80
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:32,370
If this is integral to my safety,

81
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,240
you're now chucking my safety out the
window for the convenience factor of

82
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:37,530
cycling people through security.

83
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:37,920
Well,

84
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,430
they really saying that it's not safe
and these are really what they're saying

85
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:42,740
the rabbits can thing or the,

86
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:42,991
no,

87
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:43,081
no,

88
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:43,590
no.

89
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,310
I'm talking about,

90
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,450
I'm talking about if we need those,

91
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,450
those body scanning machines because they
can detect a whole bunch of stuff that

92
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:49,740
a traditional x ray can't.

93
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,011
Oh,

94
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:51,480
is that when it gets to inconvenient?

95
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:52,650
Because the line is too long.

96
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,420
You're now throwing my
safety out the window.

97
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:55,530
That seems inconsistent.

98
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,490
It seems wrong.

99
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:56,761
Right?

100
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:57,360
Crazy.

101
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,150
But I'm in line to go through the
x and then randomly they do the,

102
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,310
uh,

103
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,580
you need to go through
the rapid scan machines.

104
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:02,861
So I said,

105
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:03,820
can I just go through the x Ray?

106
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,271
No,

107
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:04,820
you can't.

108
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,580
Now they're angry with me
because I even asked that.

109
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,500
So I opt out as I normally do.

110
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,210
My belongings go through the machine.

111
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,410
Now I can't see them.

112
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:11,891
I say,

113
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:12,071
Hey,

114
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:13,090
I can't see my laptop.

115
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:13,960
I can't see my phone.

116
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:14,651
I can't see any of that stuff.

117
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:15,340
It's over there.

118
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:15,660
You're la,

119
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,690
your belongings are fine.

120
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,681
How do I know that?

121
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:18,431
I can't see them?

122
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:19,570
They didn't give anybody to do it.

123
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:20,740
So I'm already on edge.

124
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:20,921
Right?

125
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:21,370
I always hit it.

126
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,380
Always feel like whenever I
take a fucking jet blue flight,

127
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:24,520
this is gonna be my occupied moment.

128
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:27,220
It's gonna end with pepper spray to the
face and I'm gonna get handcuffed even

129
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:28,420
though as polite as can be.

130
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,171
And I just,

131
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:30,850
I just want someone to
watch my shit right?

132
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,780
I get stuck in a glass box where I'm next
to a girl that couldn't have been more

133
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,040
than six years old.

134
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:36,600
Um,

135
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,230
she has a handicap.

136
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:40,360
She's in a wheelchair and there was
something mentally wrong with her.

137
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:41,194
She was stemming,

138
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,130
she was rocking.

139
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,030
She was pulling her hair and crying
because there were three TSA agents trying

140
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:49,240
to tell her to lift her arms
so they can swab her clothes,

141
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,410
swab her wheelchair,

142
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,400
the back pad,

143
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,270
the tires,

144
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,171
the wheels,

145
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:53,800
everything.

146
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,200
Her Dad is there on the brink.

147
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:59,380
You can imagine how traumatic it is to
try to bring somebody in a special needs

148
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:01,240
child through an airport in general.

149
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,390
But now they've been selected for special
screening and he has to try to explain

150
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,100
to his daughter who was having a fit.

151
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,340
Rightfully so as strangers
are groping her and you know,

152
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,031
swiping,

153
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:10,930
swabbing her seat.

154
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,610
He's trying to calm her down.

155
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,000
Well,

156
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,181
you know,

157
00:04:13,181 --> 00:04:16,180
by holding an iPad and her face and doing
whatever he can to get her to relax.

158
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,650
Do I have to lift her out of the seat?

159
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:18,031
He asked.

160
00:04:18,031 --> 00:04:18,864
Yes you do.

161
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,750
He's trying to lift her up.

162
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:20,470
She's fighting it.

163
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,000
My heart is breaking for this guy.

164
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,570
The reason I'm sitting in this glass
box is because after my pat down,

165
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:28,360
they ran my little piece of cloth or they
ran the gloves and the piece of cloth

166
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:30,610
that they swipe the bottom of
my feet with through a machine.

167
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,990
Like by the way,

168
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:32,650
machines would lead,

169
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,070
which we spent more than $30 million on
to install and airports in this machine

170
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:38,380
said I tested positive for nitrates.

171
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,460
I had that will happen one.

172
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:39,731
Yeah.

173
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:40,350
And I pulled up.

174
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:40,601
Oh,

175
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:41,470
so what's a nitrate?

176
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,311
Well sir,

177
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:42,701
it's a,

178
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:42,941
you know,

179
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:44,380
that could be used as a chemical.

180
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,161
Okay.

181
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:45,994
What does that mean?

182
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:46,481
Well,

183
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:48,070
it's a chemical be used
in a lot of things.

184
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:48,401
It doesn't,

185
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:48,790
this isn't a,

186
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,570
it's not a bad thing.

187
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,270
It's not a bad thing.

188
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,760
Like this isn't a problem and I go,

189
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:51,911
no,

190
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:55,030
it is a problem because I have a flight
to catch and I want to know like why I'm

191
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:55,900
being detained longer.

192
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,560
While you're tested positive for nitrates,

193
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,230
we have to give you a,

194
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,560
an even more thorough screening.

195
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,030
Okay,

196
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,190
well what else can test
positive for nitrates?

197
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,360
Guy Couldn't answer it.

198
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:05,470
Second person couldn't answer it.

199
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,270
Third person ask you if
you had been to a farm.

200
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,141
No they did not.

201
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,670
But the third guy finally said,

202
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:10,020
well the,

203
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,220
the head of the security mob there said,

204
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,740
well if you've walked on grass
that has fertilizer on it,

205
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:16,300
then you might test positive for nitrates.

206
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,810
Even a certain heart medications that
seniors take and test positive for

207
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:20,410
nitrates.

208
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,360
So I'm now stuck in a glass box,

209
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:27,150
detached from my valuables watching
this poor girl having a meltdown.

210
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,310
As these three people are going to love
her and I start to cry cause it just,

211
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,990
it breaks my heart that this is happening.

212
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:34,450
This poor guy is having
to go through this and I,

213
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:34,751
you know,

214
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,730
I go to put my hand on a
shoulder and tell him like,

215
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,301
I'm sorry,

216
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:37,991
you have to go through this.

217
00:05:37,991 --> 00:05:39,730
And he looks back and he's choked up.

218
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,970
I mean he's been in there for a good
15 minutes trying to calm down his

219
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:43,750
daughter.

220
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,830
So then I start questioning,

221
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,030
why are you guys doing this?

222
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,770
And I'm being polite and being calm,

223
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,380
being everything you could possibly be
while asking how much longer this is

224
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:51,880
going to take because I
have a flight to catch.

225
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,150
They grab my belongings and
start walking them away and go,

226
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:55,541
excuse me.

227
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:55,901
What are you doing?

228
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:56,200
Like you're,

229
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,710
you're coming here to this
private screening room.

230
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,221
No,

231
00:05:58,221 --> 00:05:58,281
no,

232
00:05:58,281 --> 00:05:58,401
no.

233
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:59,480
I don't want to be in a
private screening room.

234
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:03,680
I want this enhanced pat down to happen
right here because I want my girlfriend

235
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:04,514
to videotape it.

236
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:04,971
Well,

237
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:05,121
no,

238
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:05,181
no,

239
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:05,511
no sir.

240
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:06,740
You're going by this time,

241
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,380
my belongings are in the frosted
glass private screening room.

242
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,590
Now I'm in the private screening room
with them and there's a giant placard that

243
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:14,720
says this is a private security room.

244
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,520
There was no filming whatsoever.

245
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:17,060
If a tree,

246
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,280
if a TSA employee tells
you to stop filming,

247
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:20,600
you must seats filming immediately.

248
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,600
You do have the right to call
in a witness to be there.

249
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,673
And I'm thinking,

250
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,390
why can't the camera be my witness?

251
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,790
Because if I'm traveling alone,

252
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,130
who else am I going to call fucking
Ghostbusters am I gonna Bring Tsa in here?

253
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,530
So I'm in a glass box
with two dudes by myself.

254
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,660
He swabs me down with the
gloves and then he says,

255
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:36,230
I'll be right back.

256
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,060
I have to test this glove goes,

257
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,740
puts his hand on the handle of the door
with the glove on it that he just wiped

258
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:43,400
me down,

259
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,290
opens it up and walks
out on his merry way.

260
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,270
So I looked to the other
guy who's left in the room.

261
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:47,511
I'm like,

262
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:48,500
what the fuck was that?

263
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,690
And it was like the first
time I had cursed and he goes,

264
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:51,051
what do you mean?

265
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:51,380
I'm like,

266
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,210
he just swapped my body
down with that glove.

267
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:54,350
Then grabbed the handle.

268
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,910
If someone in her earlier
did have explosives on them
and he grabbed that handle

269
00:06:58,911 --> 00:06:59,481
with that glove.

270
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:00,620
That's now on my test.

271
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,970
Why is any testing right here?

272
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:02,900
There's a machine in the room.

273
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,471
Oh Sir.

274
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:05,120
That that machine's calibration is off.

275
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:05,954
That's why it's here.

276
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:06,471
Oh,

277
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:07,221
it happened in the room?

278
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:08,001
Cause the calibration is off.

279
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:08,121
Yeah.

280
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:09,920
There's a tag on it that
says it needs to be serviced.

281
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,610
Okay.

282
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,350
So I'm waiting five minutes go by.

283
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,090
I've strike up conversation with the guy.

284
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:16,700
I hate that that little girl out there
in the wheelchair that's having the fit

285
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:19,580
and I can still hear her having
a poor meltdown out there.

286
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,690
Why are they out there?

287
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,000
Well he tested positive
for nitrates as well.

288
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,290
Oh he did?

289
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:24,770
Yeah.

290
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,640
Why is the girl there?

291
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:25,911
Oh,

292
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:27,500
she tested positive for nitrates.

293
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:27,860
Oh.

294
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,190
So all three of us have tested positive
for nitrates with the one machine that's

295
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:31,521
out there.

296
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:34,700
You've got another one in here that
need servicing and recalibration and you

297
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:36,410
think there's nothing
wrong with this situation.

298
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,281
Guy Comes back,

299
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:37,611
tells me,

300
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:38,061
I'm clear,

301
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:41,750
I leave the room and I see the father
is still there struggling with his

302
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:42,860
daughter and I'm like,

303
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,240
I'm again like moved to tears.

304
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:45,260
And I asked this guy,

305
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,760
tell me as a human being,

306
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:47,690
do you think this is right?

307
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,940
Do you think this treatment
for this poor girl is right?

308
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,020
And he goes,

309
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,381
sir,

310
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:54,050
she tested positive for
nitrates and went right.

311
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,913
I get that.

312
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,060
But there are many other countries who
deal with terrorism on a far greater

313
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:03,740
level than we do who have far more
swifter and more and more common sense

314
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:06,500
approach to security that
doesn't demean their citizenry.

315
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:09,020
That doesn't cost them
millions of taxpayer dollars.

316
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,940
Do you think that that's right,

317
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:12,110
that that girl is having a meltdown,

318
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:12,950
you're swabbing her wheelchair,

319
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:13,970
do you really think she's a terrorist?

320
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,410
I'm just asking you as a human being.

321
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,900
And there was a long pause and he sort
of looked down and looked at his shoes

322
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:18,734
and I thought,

323
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,371
good,

324
00:08:19,371 --> 00:08:20,480
I'm finally going to have a moment,

325
00:08:20,481 --> 00:08:24,080
a real moment here as a human being is
going to take off that TSA helmet for a

326
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:24,351
second.

327
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:26,090
And he looked up and looked
me right in the eyes and says,

328
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,430
