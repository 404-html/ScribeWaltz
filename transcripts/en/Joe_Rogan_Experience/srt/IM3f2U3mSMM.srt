1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,920
The joe rogan experience,
what are the other things that are of

2
00:00:05,921 --> 00:00:10,921
concern to you as a congresswoman that
you're seeing not addressed or that are

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,280
somehow or another still in place when
you feel like they should have?

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,151
Then?
You know,

5
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:15,984
there's,
there's,

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,690
there's,
there's a long laundry list of issues

7
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:23,100
and I think you can go through each of
the major issues that a lot of folks are

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,520
concerned about and pick those apart and
say,

9
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:28,020
hey,
here are the things that we need to

10
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:33,021
address and improve in each of those.
But I think that the conversation that I

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,020
hope more people start having is about
how w why aren't these things being

12
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:44,190
fixed or addressed.
And that that speaks directly to,

13
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,570
um,
people's unwillingness to actually talk

14
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:51,300
to each other,
to stop demonizing each other because

15
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:55,380
you're from the other camp and actually
engage based on our common mission of

16
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:58,230
serving the people,
serving the people of this country.

17
00:00:58,231 --> 00:00:58,951
And,
you know,

18
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:01,470
that's something I look back to during
my time,

19
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,510
uh,
in uniform serving the whole army

20
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:06,000
national guard.
You've got diverse people,

21
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,070
diverse opinions,
diverse ideas,

22
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:09,570
but ultimately,
you know,

23
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:14,550
we were the same flag on our uniform and
we are focused singularly on,

24
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:17,100
on that same purpose and mission.

25
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,340
And unfortunately that's what we're
missing a lot of in Congress's,

26
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:25,341
the hyper partisanship and the political
winds to often take precedence over,

27
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,280
um,
the reason why people in our districts

28
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:34,020
hire us to go and work there.
And a lot of that comes from not having

29
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:37,410
a basic level of respect or Aloha for
each other as people.

30
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,810
And instead just saying,
hey,

31
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:42,990
it's us against them.
Pick your label.

32
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,490
And that's where the battles are fought
and end.

33
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:50,310
Who suffers as a result of this?
The people who are suffering,

34
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:52,650
who are dealing with a lot of the
challenges that we've been talking

35
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:54,330
about.
So that's something that,

36
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:55,320
you know,
I try to bring,

37
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,750
I try to bring Hawaii,
zillow hot to Washington,

38
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,700
uh,
and try to bring that through in the

39
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:03,450
work that I'm trying to do on these
different issues in the conversations

40
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:05,850
that we're having.
Sometimes it means you talk with people

41
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:07,680
who,
who you disagree with,

42
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:09,930
or you may have different ideas,
uh,

43
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,090
than they have about how you solve these
problems.

44
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:14,400
But if even if you're able to come
together on one thing,

45
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,690
then we can start to see problems
actually being solved and,

46
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,370
and delivering results.

47
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,180
I don't know.
But he made sure I went to the place

48
00:02:23,181 --> 00:02:24,470
that they broke.
You see,

49
00:02:24,471 --> 00:02:27,290
Huntington was designed as the prison.
If he raped another inmate,

50
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,900
they sent you there.
It was the first shoe program in

51
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:31,810
America.
It was the first [inaudible].

52
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,360
What does shoe program?
A special housing unit or security

53
00:02:35,361 --> 00:02:38,100
housing unit were level five.
Supermax,

54
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,290
you know,
like Pelican Bay.

55
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,143
And,
uh,

56
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,390
your punishment was that you weren't
allowed to speak in your cell.

57
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,780
And if you got caught speaking in
yourself,

58
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,380
they came in with a nurse and they,
after they beat you down,

59
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:55,310
she jabbed you in the ass with thorazine
and they knocked you off for a week and

60
00:02:55,311 --> 00:02:58,460
you lost your mind.
So it was horrible.

61
00:02:58,461 --> 00:03:01,090
Like I told the first two years of my
sentence,

62
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,650
every day I kept my mouth shut.
I didn't care what was done around Muna.

63
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,680
You weren't allowed to say a God damn
word and a minute and you're not allowed

64
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:12,790
to talk to other inmates.
Nothing.

65
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,120
I dare you to sing happy birthday to
yourself like I did.

66
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:22,140
I paid for that one.
They fucked me up too.

67
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,200
But I don't care about that.
Look,

68
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,940
I realized I was in a race.

69
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,180
I had to kill off the person that I was.
The person that I initially was upon

70
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:42,120
entering prison was a deceitful,
lying,

71
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:45,480
coward,
but no fortitude because no self respect

72
00:03:45,481 --> 00:03:49,710
resided within me.
And in utter humbleness,

73
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:54,180
I took everything that they did to me
and I paid for every window.

74
00:03:54,181 --> 00:03:55,680
I broke everything.
I stole,

75
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,880
rely auto,
and then I started to love myself.

76
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,300
I figured I ain't getting nothing out of
this but misery.

77
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:08,330
So I'm going out like the dude,
I'm a stand up and I'm gonna speak

78
00:04:08,911 --> 00:04:13,350
beautifully on the daily to execute me.
I'm a walk to that walk,

79
00:04:13,351 --> 00:04:14,820
man.
I'm a dude,

80
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:18,180
is I didn't kill that woman,
but I damn sure ain't no coward.

81
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,620
I'm going to find out everything I can
about life.

82
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,600
And then I'm gonna face my death.
I'm a do it.

83
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,860
[inaudible] like I had this beautiful,
beautiful speech ready for him to us

84
00:04:34,171 --> 00:04:38,250
going to lay it out and just be at peace
because I realized there was nothing

85
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:41,610
else to do.
I could fight.

86
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,730
I couldn't argue.
It didn't matter because God's in

87
00:04:44,731 --> 00:04:47,490
control of my life and I really believed
that I had a choice,

88
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,970
either be a bitter pill and get sucked
dry by all the misery of mountain me or

89
00:04:53,731 --> 00:04:55,770
get my shit right and start loving
myself.

90
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,410
And then when I'm out of fight camp
since like,

91
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,810
cause sometimes when you watch a tape in
fight camp,

92
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,640
like you can mess with people's heads,
you know,

93
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:05,010
like the maybe maybe cal was getting too
nervous and then when he's white gives

94
00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:07,090
him anxiety to watch the fight.
You know,

95
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,080
so you need to have a,
if that's the case,

96
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,360
you know,
have a coach that's willing to,

97
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:13,610
that you trust to do that for you.
That's a good point.

98
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,170
Now cause let me do it.
It's a mental,

99
00:05:15,171 --> 00:05:16,670
this fucking sports,
a mental mind.

100
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,460
Fuck man.
Yeah of course.

101
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,750
Whatever works the best for you.
Is that what you got to figure out?

102
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,430
Is it better for you to fight someone
like cody that you have all this

103
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,500
animosity and beef towards and all the
shit talking cause you get super hyped

104
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:31,610
up and motivated every day?

105
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,640
Or is it better to fight someone who you
have a lot of respect for was just a

106
00:05:36,681 --> 00:05:39,950
good challenge?
I think you've got to learn to live,

107
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,020
like to be the same person for every
fight.

108
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,020
I think it's like control those
emotions.

109
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:46,580
You know,
even if there was all that coming in,

110
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:48,560
like I'm nervous to fight,
you know,

111
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:50,090
like forget all the bullshit,
you know?

112
00:05:50,091 --> 00:05:51,470
And I had to learn that through my
career.

113
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,510
I had to learn to take emotion out of
it.

114
00:05:53,511 --> 00:05:54,680
I mean,
even in sparring still,

115
00:05:54,681 --> 00:05:55,850
you know,
like join the,

116
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,340
he's telling me control my emotion,
a controlled aggression,

117
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,720
you know,
cause you hit me,

118
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:01,490
I want to hit you back.
I'm very competitive.

119
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,710
So it's something you have to learn how
to control.

120
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:05,300
And I've had to do that throughout my
career.

121
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,210
Um,
and I think everyone has learned to

122
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:11,750
control either to let go or to pull
back,

123
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,000
you know,
like really control that emotion to be

124
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:16,910
the same person every fight,
you know?

125
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,080
Um,
mentally,

126
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,490
mentally,
not the same person every five and

127
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:21,620
mentally in your own head,
the same person,

128
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,930
but technically need to be able to
switch it up.

129
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,010
That the mental aspect of it is probably
the thing that holds more people back

130
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:29,840
then.
Anything like we all know of guys that

131
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:34,250
are just monsters in the gym and for
whatever it was when they would go to

132
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:37,160
compete,
they just could never be their full

133
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:37,994
self.
Yeah.

134
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,330
Tj does better in the cage.
Yeah,

135
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,253
it does.
In the gym.

136
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,760
Yeah.
I did better in the,

137
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:46,340
in the gym then in the cage.
What do you think it is

138
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,300
that makes you do better?
I love it.

139
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,730
I don't know.
I mean I've just taught myself to love

140
00:06:50,731 --> 00:06:51,650
this shit.
Like I'm,

141
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,520
I'm like,
I don't know when I get out there it's

142
00:06:53,521 --> 00:06:55,110
just like I want to be there,
you know?

143
00:06:55,111 --> 00:06:57,060
Like I know everyone's nervous and like
they're like,

144
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,970
it's the highest highs.
But I used to be so nervous that I

145
00:06:59,971 --> 00:07:01,680
forget like what happened in the fight,
you know?

146
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,840
But throughout my career,
I think after the Mike Easton fights,

147
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,720
when I really started to like hone in
our,

148
00:07:06,721 --> 00:07:09,450
during the Mike Easton fives when I
really started to hone in and have fun

149
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:11,040
and uh,
just realize like,

150
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:11,970
fuck this shit man.
Like,

151
00:07:11,971 --> 00:07:14,840
what's the worst is going to happen?
You need knocked out the rule for it.

152
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,880
You know,
it's so crazy subject,

153
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,670
right?
I mean,

154
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,100
uh,
you and I have known each other since

155
00:07:20,101 --> 00:07:25,101
2012 when I did meat eater.
You were there filming when I shot my

156
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:28,260
first deer,
which is very important part of my life,

157
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:29,980
man.
And um,

158
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:34,950
then you went on to direct and produce
parts unknown with our late friend

159
00:07:34,951 --> 00:07:39,210
Anthony Bordain and uh,
we started probably be a good thing to

160
00:07:39,211 --> 00:07:41,370
come in here and just talk,
talk about them.

161
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,461
Yeah,
man.

162
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:43,390
And,
uh,

163
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,650
and I'm really grateful for it.
You know,

164
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,760
it's actually,
you know,

165
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:49,090
a lot of people,
um,

166
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,120
who have been saying to me like,
oh,

167
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:51,620
it must be really hard to talk about
that.

168
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:52,454
It must really,
it's,

169
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,860
I actually find it kind of the opposite.
Like I want to talk about him.

170
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:59,600
I want to talk about who he was and what
that experience was,

171
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,493
you know,
so,

172
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,510
um,
thanks ma'am.

173
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,390
My pleasure brother.
Did you,

174
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,180
did you know him before you guys started
working together?

175
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,660
No.
No.

176
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:10,130
I met Tony,
uh,

177
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,960
10 years ago and I was called in.
Uh,

178
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,270
he had,
uh,

179
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,810
a DP on a show who at the last minute
canceled,

180
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,910
couldn't go to Egypt.
So,

181
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,860
uh,
I got a call like a week before,

182
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,731
you know,
it's like,

183
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:24,230
do you want to go to Egypt with Anthony?
Bordain?

184
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:27,300
I was like,
you're fucking absolutely right.

185
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,850
You know?
Um,

186
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,830
and uh,
and so I met him in Cairo,

187
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:31,640
man.
Like,

188
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,200
you know,
we kind of like perfect.

189
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:34,011
Yeah.
Holy Shit.

190
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:37,490
That's like Indiana Jones stuff.
Exactly.

191
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:38,181
Man.
Episode.

192
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:40,250
When you guys ate a camel.
No,

193
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:41,630
no,
we didn't need a camel.

194
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,650
No,
but,

195
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:44,840
um,
you know,

196
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,800
uh,
uh,

197
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:47,690
met him there.
You know,

198
00:08:47,691 --> 00:08:50,990
we started filming were on the streets
of Cairo and like,

199
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,790
you know,
it's like all of a sudden is thrown in

200
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:53,351
these kitchens.
There,

201
00:08:53,351 --> 00:08:54,950
it looks like we're eating pigeon,
you know,

202
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,110
it's like go and cover them cooking
pigeon and get an idea.

203
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,690
I had seen the show like maybe once
before,

204
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:03,690
but I had,
I knew who he was and I knew what that

205
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:04,980
adventure was.
Right.

206
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,440
You know,
and I was so amped for it.

207
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,500
Um,
and then there was like this seminal

208
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:12,720
moment on that show where,
uh,

209
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,230
we go out and weed,
we go ripping across the desert with the

210
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:20,670
Bedouin and go out and cook a goat a in
the ground,

211
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:22,110
you know.
Um,

212
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,290
and so as we're driving out over the
desert,

213
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:25,831
we're like,
well,

214
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,870
we need to,
we need some shots from car to car.

215
00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:28,351
Right.
And I was like,

216
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:29,220
Oh,
get on the roof,

217
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,660
you know,
and uh,

218
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:33,630
and there's like this for,
for some reason there's a four post bed

219
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,940
tied to the roof of this land rover.
And so I get up there and kind of like,

220
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,890
you know,
latch my arm around it.

221
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,590
And these guys take off at,
I,

222
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,820
I swear,
80 miles an hour across the desert.

223
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,380
I mean,
and you're on a bed.

224
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:50,040
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

225
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:53,460
No regard for the fact that like,
I'm on the roof,

226
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:54,760
you know,
um,

227
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,730
shooting and,
uh,

228
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,190
and when we got there,
we got to camp.

229
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,760
I survived it.
I'm at this big black and blue where I

230
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:07,110
was holding on to the four post bed and
I go over and I show Tony and,

231
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,520
um,
that was it,

232
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:10,920
man.
From that moment on,

233
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,181
it was,
he was like,

234
00:10:12,181 --> 00:10:14,670
I like this guy.
And I started going out with him,

235
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,860
you know,
I started getting invited to do more

236
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:21,861
shows.
Okay.
