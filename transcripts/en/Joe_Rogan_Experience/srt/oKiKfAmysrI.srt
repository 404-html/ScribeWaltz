1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,220
No,
it just seems the problem with the

2
00:00:02,221 --> 00:00:03,690
marijuana is five,
four,

3
00:00:03,691 --> 00:00:04,770
three,
two,

4
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,290
one.
Dennis Mckenna,

5
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:10,830
ladies and gentlemen,
before we were just discussing how I was

6
00:00:10,831 --> 00:00:14,400
saying that marijuana can be your friend
and it can enhance your life,

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,890
but if,
if you take too much,

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,320
it's such a seductive little creature
because a little bit of it as like,

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,740
Oh,
this is nice,

10
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:25,140
this feels good,
but if you get too crazy,

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,170
especially if you get too crazy with
edibles,

12
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,450
it'll take you and take you away on this
wild journey of paranoia and,

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,280
and,
and you'll,

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,190
it'll lock you up.
Like some people just need to take a

15
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,470
couple of weeks off,
just relax.

16
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,340
That's always a good idea,
right?

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,691
Yeah,
yeah.

18
00:00:42,691 --> 00:00:46,050
I think people underestimate cannabis.
I think it can be like,

19
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,960
hey,
couldn't really sort of knock you off

20
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:52,440
your center,
especially if it's edible and like all

21
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:54,330
these things,
you got to learn how to use it.

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,580
Yeah,
I mean it's basically that's what you

23
00:00:56,581 --> 00:00:59,280
gotta do.
You'll have to learn how to use it,

24
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,470
but you know,
you know,

25
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:04,890
that's my raps rap,
but it's a great wrap.

26
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:06,390
It really is.
It's so important.

27
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:08,370
It's,
I think it's so important for people to

28
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:12,480
realize that he got to let like regular
you,

29
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,630
like you like natural sober you.
It's important to be in touch with that.

30
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,130
Like you don't want them always be high
or always be caffeinated or always be

31
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:24,900
anything like.
Exactly.

32
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,160
I mean we're,
you know,

33
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,880
people get,
you know,

34
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,940
to these places and they fail to do a
reality check on themselves,

35
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:33,661
you know?
I mean,

36
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:36,060
I get emails from people all the time
so.

37
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,650
Well I'm,
you know,

38
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:42,240
life's been pretty weird lately.
I took mushrooms five times last week

39
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,730
and it's like,
dude,

40
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:50,030
how about you lay off for a while and
give her a chance because you know,

41
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:52,590
they tell these stories.

42
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,000
It's like the idea of,
okay,

43
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:57,250
let's find your center.
Go back to baseline layoff,

44
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,660
the sauce,
whatever it is you're taking and just

45
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:03,750
chill out.
I'm trying to rediscover your center.

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,500
It seems like common sense advice,
but people don't do it.

47
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:09,480
Does he?
My common sense advice but common sense

48
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:11,880
is not common.
I think everybody knows that.

49
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,520
Yes.
All you have to do is look around,

50
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,190
realize what is it about people though
that one thing,

51
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:21,690
dosage in any sort of a minute,
it doesn't even have to be a substance.

52
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:23,820
It can be an activity like gambling for
instance,

53
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:29,260
like once it gets in your bones,
it just seems like you're so compelled

54
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,050
to just continue that behavior and and
the idea of stopping is almost more

55
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:39,330
painful than the idea of wrecking your
life.

56
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,921
This,
this,

57
00:02:39,921 --> 00:02:40,820
this,
this,

58
00:02:40,821 --> 00:02:43,590
this addiction.
This is basically these things are

59
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,600
reinforcing.
They activate those pleasure circuits in

60
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,330
the brain mediated mainly through
dopamine and all of these.

61
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,820
I mean the,
the so called drugs with abuse,

62
00:02:56,821 --> 00:02:58,890
which I think is a terrible word,
terrible,

63
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,040
but

64
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,780
you know,
the reinforcing drugs,

65
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:06,520
the pleasure drugs work directly or
indirectly through the delta circuits

66
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:10,390
and the dopamine is like your,
your button for pleasure.

67
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,990
You know,
in the same way that Serotonin is kind

68
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:17,890
of on the opposite side,
it's your button for more like euphoria,

69
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,540
feeling good but not the.
It doesn't have the punch.

70
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,990
I guess that the,
which is why people can get addicted to

71
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:28,240
gambling.
They can get addicted to sex,

72
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,730
they couldn't get addicted to
television.

73
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:33,840
All of these things.
It doesn't have to be substances because

74
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,850
they all hit those same circuits,
you know,

75
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,560
except the psychedelics which don't work
on that reward circuitry.

76
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:43,900
They work on a different set of
circuits,

77
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,640
but yet even with those you are behavior
patterns can become addictive and then

78
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:51,790
you can start just doing psychedelics
too much and it's not even the

79
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,140
psychedelics that are doing it.

80
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,700
It's just this compulsive need to
constantly change your state of mind.

81
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,250
Oh yeah,
that's quite true.

82
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:01,600
And if people,
you know,

83
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:03,820
the way they use psychedelics is,
is

84
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,560
there are many ways to use it,
but basically use the thoughtfully,

85
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,210
you know,
I mean you can

86
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:16,420
all the question about recreational use
versus spiritual use versus therapeutic

87
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:18,790
use.
I mean these are all ways to approach it

88
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:22,480
and I am not a person who says you must
do it this way.

89
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:26,140
You must do it that way.
What I do say is do it from an informed

90
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:29,860
place and do approach it thoughtfully.
No,

91
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,480
because I mean,
in other words,

92
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,480
don't you know,
planned for it.

93
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:36,970
Respect the medicine in a certain way,
you know,

94
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,240
use it in a circumstance where you can
learn from the medicine rather than have

95
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:45,060
the medicine be sort of a,
you know,

96
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,560
overlay a but over whatever else you're
doing.

97
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,030
I mean this is something that demands
attention and I think that's the best

98
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:54,820
way to use psychedelics and for
whatever,

99
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,300
you know,
whatever spin you put on it is that

100
00:04:58,301 --> 00:05:02,280
spiritual as a therapeutic is a
recreational as Shamani.

101
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,960
These are all labeled.
The important thing is that,

102
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,500
you know,
you have the,

103
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,550
you approach the medicine itself.
The medicine is the teacher,

104
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,320
right?
Not The sitter,

105
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,400
not the Shaman,
that's the psychotherapist.

106
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,510
If they're doing the right their job
correctly,

107
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,910
in my opinion,
their job is to let you have your

108
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:28,990
encounter with the medicine and the
medicine is what you learned from.

109
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,240
They're there to facilitate that.
They can intervene if you get anxious or

110
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:36,240
have things go on,
make sure you know,

111
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,590
nobody comes to the door,
that kind of thing.

112
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,060
But basically it's to facilitate a
learning opportunity where you and your

113
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:44,680
teacher,
which is the medicine,

114
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:49,681
be at Iowasca or mushrooms or whatever.
Can have this intense one on one

115
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,960
interaction,
you know,

116
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,980
I feel like with psychedelics as well as
with all these other

117
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,430
things that we're talking about,
any kind of drug,

118
00:05:59,431 --> 00:06:01,790
I mean even coffee,
alcohol,

119
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,220
whatever,
and behavior patterns,

120
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:06,740
all these different things.
I think one of the things that happens

121
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:11,660
with human beings is you get so far
along in your life in these behavior

122
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:16,661
patterns become so tight grooves that
are carved into your psyche and then as

123
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:23,050
you become an adult,
then you start to learn like,

124
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,740
oh,
there's got to be a better way to handle

125
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:26,540
this.
Let me figure out how to do this.

126
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,600
And it's almost like getting a car when
you're really young and not learning how

127
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:35,300
to drive until you're like in your
twenties and so you're just driving this

128
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:37,760
thing.
It's smashing into trees and grinding

129
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:40,520
the gears and then somewhere along the
line you're like,

130
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:41,960
oh my God,
I'm fucking myself up.

131
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,420
I have to figure out a way to do this
correctly.

132
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,850
And there's two different approaches.
One,

133
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,220
the abstinence approach,
which is very popular.

134
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:49,791
People say,
well,

135
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,080
I'm,
I'm straight edge now.

136
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,540
I don't do anything and that's it and I
just,

137
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,360
you know,
just do wheat grass and I run hills and

138
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:57,410
stuff and like,
okay,

139
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,030
you could do that too.
I mean,

140
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,340
you can do it.
You definitely can do that too,

141
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,850
but it's.
I just don't think that there's anything

142
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:08,150
wrong with any of these things.
I think there's something wrong with the

143
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:11,990
way we use them and I think it's one of
the inherent problems with things being

144
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:16,991
illegal is that we can't discuss this.
We don't have people like you or centers

145
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:22,130
where people can go where people can
become educated on the proper way to use

146
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:24,770
these drugs or medicines,
whatever you want to call them,

147
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:29,150
these compounds and get something out of
them that can really be beneficial.

148
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,630
Right.
That's exactly right.

149
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,340
I mean,
I've said this many,

150
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:34,890
many times that,
you know,

151
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,960
drug education,
what they call drug education in this

152
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:42,070
country is a joke because the whole
emphasis is on don't use them.

153
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,800
That's absurd.
That's like telling,

154
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,630
you know,
an 18 year old guy full of testosterone

155
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,580
don't have sex.
Come on,

156
00:07:51,581 --> 00:07:54,910
it's built into the genetics.
They're going to go for that.

157
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,800
What you have to do,
what they can bring themselves to

158
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:04,690
acknowledge in the drug education field
is it's not about telling people not to

159
00:08:04,691 --> 00:08:07,810
use drugs.
It's about teaching people how to use

160
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:11,020
drugs
if they choose to.

161
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,480
Right.
I mean like any other skill,

162
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:17,620
people have to learn to drive.
They have to learn to do yoga.

163
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:19,510
They have to learn to do whatever they
do.

164
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,620
There's an educational process.
I tell people many times,

165
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:27,370
you know,
my shtick is there is no such thing as a

166
00:08:27,371 --> 00:08:30,610
bad drug and that's another problem with
the dialogue.

167
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:35,610
The badness is projected onto the drugs.
The drugs are simply compounds with a

168
00:08:35,651 --> 00:08:36,880
certain form.
Ecology.

169
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:40,690
There's no moral aspect to them.
The moral dimension comes in.

170
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,560
How do people use them?
That's where you know it's human

171
00:08:44,561 --> 00:08:47,200
behavior that's moral or immoral life.
I say,

172
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,780
you know,
there's no such thing as a bad drug.

173
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:55,350
Plenty of bad ways to use drugs,
but that comes from the not the calm

174
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,590
town.
I've been really disturbed lately by

175
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:02,630
these new super potent painkillers.
Oh,

176
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,510
it's fentanyl.
All the stuff that killed prince and

177
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,680
carfentanil now,
as the big men say fentanyl is bad

178
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:15,480
enough,
carfentanil is something like 100 to a

179
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,310
thousand times more potent than
fentanyl.

180
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,500
What?
Yeah.

181
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:24,590
So as Spec,
literally a pinhead or less of the

182
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:29,250
Carfentanil is a lethal dose.
Oh my God.

183
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,280
Yeah.
So this is really not good,

184
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,260
you know,
because I am certainly not an expert on,

185
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,030
you know,
the sources and all this,

186
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:43,890
but apparently this stuff is being made
in China imported here and they use it

187
00:09:43,891 --> 00:09:48,150
to cut heroin because it's so strong
that people are dying left and right.

188
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:53,010
You know,
because of Carfentanil is far more,

189
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,110
uh,
far more toxic than heroin or even

190
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,400
fentanyl.
So,

191
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,920
you know,
we're so,

192
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,260
you know,
there is so much,

193
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,260
I don't know,
so much confusing and,

194
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,050
and fuzzy thinking about the whole drug
issue,

195
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,880
you know,
for example,

196
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:15,300
as long as we're talking about opiates
for the moment,

197
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,670
which is not really what I came in,
talked about.

198
00:10:17,671 --> 00:10:19,470
But um,
you know,

199
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,500
you've heard of Kratom yeah.
Right now the DEA and the FDA.

200
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:27,270
It's a plant.
It's used in Thailand.

201
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:30,060
It is an OPA.
There's no doubt about it hits the

202
00:10:30,061 --> 00:10:33,300
opiate receptors and they want to
schedule it,

203
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,530
but the problem is that in Thailand
traditional areas,

204
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:42,590
it's often used to get off of heroin,
so it's potentially part of the

205
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:45,720
solution,
not part of the problem.

206
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,880
It's a,
you know,

207
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:51,890
it's relatively easy to quit and the big
thing about Kratom it doesn't cause

208
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:57,150
respiratory depression and respiratory
depression is what kills people from

209
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,370
narco,
from heroin overdoses.

210
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:04,370
It's the alkaloids and Metro Jina and do
not do that and Kratom is currently in

211
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:08,940
those weird semi illegal states and this
semi legal state,

212
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:13,941
but the DEA would love to schedule it,
but again they had plans to and there

213
00:11:15,061 --> 00:11:18,450
was some pushback about this.
Some people were saying things like,

214
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:19,530
I'm saying,
wait a minute,

215
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:24,630
let's take a second look at this.
This may be part of the solution because

216
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:29,250
it could be a kind of a in a sense,
and the herbal methadone.

217
00:11:29,251 --> 00:11:32,250
I mean Methadone's not the best way,
but something that people could

218
00:11:32,251 --> 00:11:37,251
substitute and then gradually taper off.
Kratom has some weird sort of property.

219
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:40,530
We're at low doses is a stimulant.
Yes,

220
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,320
I've tried it before,
but only at low doses I've had,

221
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,190
um,
there's a company that sells it,

222
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,040
that we have it right here.
Oh,

223
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,930
there are lots of companies that sell
it.

224
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,670
Yeah.
His company,

225
00:11:50,671 --> 00:11:55,510
um,
urban ice organics,

226
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,070
that's the name of the company.
Um,

227
00:11:57,071 --> 00:12:00,400
but I've,
I take two or three of those and it's

228
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:04,600
like a cup of coffee and it's like no
weirdness.

229
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:08,230
No,
don't feel high that at a low dose.

230
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,510
It is that.
Why is that a stimulant?

231
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,210
Who knows?
Just unique pharmacology.

232
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,450
How strange though,
at higher doses it's a,

233
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,560
it's definitely an OPA.
And is it something that impairs motor

234
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:22,150
skills?
Uh,

235
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:23,800
well,
not so much.

236
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:28,830
I mean just in the sense that it's like
being high on morphine or heroin does.

237
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:31,600
I mean,
you know,

238
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,730
so it really can give you that kind of a
feeling.

239
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,380
Absolute.
Wow,

240
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:36,910
that's interesting.
You know,

241
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:40,660
it hits the opiate receptors,
but then it also hits few other

242
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,950
receptors as well,
which is part of the stimulating effect.

243
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:50,310
But you know why the pharmaceutical
companies are not all over this plan?

244
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:55,530
I don't understand because for a long
time the holy grail and drug discovery

245
00:12:56,351 --> 00:13:01,351
when it comes to analgesics is fine.
The narcotic that is not toxic,

246
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,380
you know,
the analgesic that is not toxic,

247
00:13:05,381 --> 00:13:08,950
hopefully not addicting,
but that's not gonna happen.

248
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,190
And is there an ld 50 for this stuff?
Old Short.

249
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:17,370
I mean there's an ld 50 for most things.
For people in a lethal dose at 50

250
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,690
percent it would be hard.
Yeah,

251
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,230
the full dose for 50 percent of the size
of the sample.

252
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,680
But in the herbal form it would be hard
to get anywhere near a lethal dose.

253
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,530
You have to giant brick of it.
Probably probably you throw up before he

254
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:35,200
ever got to the league,
if you,

255
00:13:35,201 --> 00:13:40,201
if you isolated one of the alkaloids,
seven hydroxy metro is the strongest one

256
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:43,690
that's about 100 times stronger than
morphine.

257
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,070
Whoa.
You know,

258
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,450
so definitely effect.

259
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,970
So is there any issue with that stuff
though,

260
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:52,570
with people who have had problems with
pain pills in the past,

261
00:13:52,571 --> 00:13:54,880
maybe they start indulging this a little
bit too much and.

262
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,300
Well it's a better alternative than the
pain pills.

263
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,750
It's very good for people who want to
get off that shit.

264
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,200
Sorry,
can I say that?

265
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:08,470
This is the Internet want to get off,
those kinds of things.

266
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,710
They don't,
they can't quit cold Turkey,

267
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:16,711
but they could go on Kratom and
gradually cut down because the

268
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:22,860
withdrawal symptoms for Kratom or much
less apparently than for heroin and the

269
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,030
and these things,
they just don't grab you.

270
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,300
So this is a gateway out of the
addiction,

271
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,230
you know,
or they could even just maintain because

272
00:14:32,231 --> 00:14:37,231
it's not particularly dangerous,
dangerous or impairs function or so and

273
00:14:37,241 --> 00:14:38,680
they could maintain,
as you know,

274
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:41,980
lots of people take heroin and managed
to maintain.

275
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,670
Well I know a lot of people,
not everyone can do that.

276
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,760
They find some really good
anti-inflammation properties and this

277
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:50,710
stuff,
like people who exercise a lot,

278
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,950
create them.
Yeah.

279
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,470
Yeah.
Wouldn't surprise me at all if that's

280
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:56,070
there.
Um,

281
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,150
you know,
most plants have multiple effects.

282
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,210
That's one of the differences between
plants and pharmaceuticals.

283
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,690
Plants have families of molecules and
they often have complimentary tie kinds

284
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:10,060
of activities,
you know,

285
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:14,680
so Kratom is one of these,
we've known about it for awhile.

286
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,450
It needs a lot more work,
but potentially it's very,

287
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,630
very interesting,
you know,

288
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:24,440
and of course the other one and in this
sort of universe of,

289
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,050
uh,
of OPA treatment is Ibogaine,

290
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:32,170
which is not a completely different kind
of thing I will gain is not itself a,

291
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:36,080
an OPA,
but people use it to get off opiates

292
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:41,081
because the experience is profound,
but then it does something that a lot of

293
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:48,620
psychedelics don't do,
which is it interrupts that craving for

294
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,680
opiates depending on how it's structured
anywhere from a few days to a few weeks.

295
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:59,420
And the thing I think that determines
the effectiveness of,

296
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:04,510
of Ibogaine as a treatment for opiates
is if the person has prepared for what

297
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:06,490
happens afterwards,
right.

298
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,750
You got to prepare for what happens
after.

299
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,110
If you go back to your old neighborhood,
your old buddies,

300
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:14,220
your old habits.
It's not gonna work.

301
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,330
You know,
you're not making a serious commitment

302
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:20,780
to make it work.
But if you have a plan going to go to

303
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:23,360
this clinic at this treatment,
get cleaned up,

304
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,400
then what?
You know,

305
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,550
and that's true.
I mean that's really.

306
00:16:28,551 --> 00:16:33,530
I think that's the main factor that
determines whether Ibogaine is effective

307
00:16:33,531 --> 00:16:37,100
or not,
and it is for a lot of people it works.

308
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,380
It's a problematic substance.
It's not,

309
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,520
it's a controlled substance in the
states,

310
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:47,840
but only in about six countries.
Is that actually prohibited?

311
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,840
Most countries it's either in a gray
area,

312
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,660
I guess it's a gray area.

313
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,420
It's unregulated is the term couple of
countries,

314
00:16:57,421 --> 00:17:00,570
so put it on prescription drugs status,
uh,

315
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:05,710
Brazil and New Zealand.
But it's the framework is there.

316
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:09,860
That doesn't mean there's a rush of
people to go to Ibogaine clinics in

317
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:13,730
those countries.
It really hasn't created a rush.

318
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,930
But the framework is there of people who
want to want to do that.

319
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,960
So I began this,
another one of these that needs more

320
00:17:23,301 --> 00:17:28,301
investigation than is potentially part
of the problem to the opiate epidemic.

321
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,270
There is a rumor,
I will.

322
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,890
They're more than rumors,
but uh,

323
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,660
some,
uh,

324
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,900
Ibogaine activists are trying to get
certain states to provisionally approved

325
00:17:42,741 --> 00:17:45,230
the use of Ibogaine,
you know,

326
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,960
special lever from the federal
government,

327
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,510
Fremont.
And I think New York has now applied for

328
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:55,800
this because their problem is so bad.
It's like basically they're saying to

329
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:58,920
the government,
here's something that may work,

330
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:04,250
just grant permission on the state side
statewide basis to have this medicine.

331
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,800
We'll see where that goes.
You know,

332
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:08,970
as you,
I'm sure you,

333
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:14,130
I think we're all in this community
acutely aware of now.

334
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:19,131
The government is again rumbling about
how they're going to revive the war on

335
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:20,310
drugs.
I mean,

336
00:18:20,311 --> 00:18:22,020
it was a stupid idea.
The end of.

337
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:24,240
It's even more stupid now,
but hey,

338
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:29,300
that's government did stupidity are us
kind of their,

339
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:33,370
their angle on things.
So this jeff sessions characters real

340
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,270
see how it goes.
I'm not too worried because I think

341
00:18:36,271 --> 00:18:38,670
there's going to be so much pushback on
this.

342
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,500
Yeah.
And that's the other thing about trump.

343
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:44,370
He seems to be a populist and if there
is too much pushback from that

344
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:46,350
direction,
I think he's going to try to avoid that

345
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:51,180
as much as possible when they did a
recent survey of the United States.

346
00:18:51,181 --> 00:18:52,420
And how many people,
uh,

347
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,160
think that marijuana should be legal
like recreationally legal.

348
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,820
It's 60 percent now,
which is for the first time ever.

349
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,990
Yeah.
And states have done it and I just don't

350
00:19:03,991 --> 00:19:05,730
think you can,
you know,

351
00:19:05,731 --> 00:19:08,220
you can't go back to the war on drugs.
I mean,

352
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:10,770
it was a miserable failure when it
happened.

353
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:15,850
There's no over 40 years.
They pounded over a trillion dollars

354
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,410
down this rat hole.
There are more drugs,

355
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:22,710
more kinds of drugs,
easier to get cheaper than ever.

356
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:26,550
So where's the success and more people
in prison as a result of this.

357
00:19:26,551 --> 00:19:30,210
So where's the success drug?
There's nothing,

358
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,830
there's nothing they can point to.
It's not like anyone was saved.

359
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:33,743
It's not like,
right.

360
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,910
The problem is that these people,
you know,

361
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,630
facts don't carry much weight with them.
I mean,

362
00:19:39,631 --> 00:19:44,631
they're kind of off in their own private
ideological fantasy and uh,

363
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,370
the fact that the war on drugs doesn't
work,

364
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,470
doesn't matter to them.

365
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,560
It's like these are bad people who need
to be punished.

366
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:55,140
That's their,
their stance on it.

367
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:58,510
It's not about anything other than that.
Yeah.

368
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,940
I think that's really important.
What you just said.

369
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:02,700
These are bad people.
They're really talking in these

370
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,920
simplistic terms.
That's one of the thing that session

371
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:08,820
said that marijuana is not something
that good people use.

372
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,470
Preposterous grandmas are out there that
are listening to this going,

373
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,460
what the fuck is this guy talking about
this?

374
00:20:15,461 --> 00:20:16,650
This is crazy.
Well,

375
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,470
it is,
and it's clear that,

376
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:24,780
you know,
not a jot of reflection or,

377
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,920
or,
you know,

378
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,640
careful thought goes into these kinds of
statements.

379
00:20:29,641 --> 00:20:31,710
This is what bothers me.
I mean many,

380
00:20:31,711 --> 00:20:35,190
many things bothered me about trump,
but one of the chief things,

381
00:20:35,191 --> 00:20:39,690
one of the major,
I guess you could say flaws in his

382
00:20:39,691 --> 00:20:43,390
character among many,
but you listen to him talk,

383
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:47,410
he listened to his general thing and you
realize this is not a man who's ever had

384
00:20:47,411 --> 00:20:49,600
a reflective thoughts in this life.

385
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,640
You know,
there is no there,

386
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:53,710
there,
there is no inner self,

387
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,030
uh,
you know,

388
00:20:55,031 --> 00:20:56,030
people say,
oh,

389
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,500
just give that man some Iowasca and that
will straighten them out.

390
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:01,090
I don't think so.
I think there's,

391
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:05,110
you know,
there has to be something inside to

392
00:21:05,111 --> 00:21:06,280
straighten out.
I mean,

393
00:21:06,281 --> 00:21:08,980
he's,
I think that maybe I would like to speak

394
00:21:08,981 --> 00:21:11,410
to him alone and find out who he really
is.

395
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:13,420
I mean,
you think when someone's speaking in

396
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:15,010
front of,
you know,

397
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,350
a big group of press or you know,
any,

398
00:21:18,351 --> 00:21:21,100
anytime there's a camera on them,
it's really hard to figure out who that

399
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:24,250
person is.
Being alone with someone would be very

400
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:25,630
illuminating.
I would.

401
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,870
I agree.
Maybe alone he's different,

402
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:32,110
but he is such a creature of media and
television.

403
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:33,820
It's inexorable,
right?

404
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,540
Yeah.
So maybe there is a thoughtful person

405
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:40,480
there,
but I sure don't see any evidence of

406
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:41,120
that,
you know?

407
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,640
And that's unfortunate.
I mean because that's whatever you could

408
00:21:45,641 --> 00:21:48,610
say about Obama and there's many bad
things that,

409
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:50,650
you know,
he was not a perfect president.

410
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,680
He was very thoughtful and smart.
You know,

411
00:21:57,311 --> 00:22:01,510
I'm not so sure trump is smart.
I mean he's smart in a certain way,

412
00:22:01,511 --> 00:22:06,511
but not the way that we need our leaders
to be smart,

413
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,560
you know,
in this age we need to,

414
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,820
you know,
anyway,

415
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:13,900
we could go on all day about this and
that's really what we wanted to.

416
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,930
We could go on about this all day and
let's definitely not.

417
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,690
Let's instead,
let's shift gears and talk about this

418
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:24,430
celebration of 50 years of psychedelic
research and what you're doing now,

419
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,350
and it's in Birmingham.
Hazara is.

420
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,530
It's in.
It's in Buckinghamshire,

421
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,590
England.
I knew it was a B.

422
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,840
Yeah.
One of those places.

423
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,980
It's not.
This is something that I've wanted to do

424
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,090
for a long time.

425
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:45,180
And what the backstory is that in 1967
there was a conference that was

426
00:22:47,171 --> 00:22:49,060
sponsored,
believe it or not,

427
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:52,660
by the health education and Welfare
Department of Health,

428
00:22:52,661 --> 00:22:55,900
education and Welfare,
National Institute of Mental Health,

429
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:01,470
US government paid for this symposium
held in San Francisco in 1967 called the

430
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,640
ethno pharmacologic search for
psychoactive drugs.

431
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,120
And all the biggies were there.
You know,

432
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:14,290
Shogun was there.
Andrew Weil was there,

433
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,790
um,
shelties,

434
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:18,280
of course he was probably the one that,
you know,

435
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:22,660
more or less around whom it coalesce.
But this was a chance for

436
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:27,400
interdisciplinary people to come
together in a private conference and

437
00:23:27,401 --> 00:23:29,740
share knowledge.
And that was done.

438
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:34,480
And they published this symposium volume
called Ethno pharmacologic search for

439
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:38,590
psychoactive drugs,
which was us public health service

440
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,410
publication.
You could get it from the US government

441
00:23:41,411 --> 00:23:45,200
printing office for a long time.
And uh,

442
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,180
but the originally,
the idea was that about every 10 years

443
00:23:50,181 --> 00:23:52,400
or so late,
how followup conferences,

444
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:52,760
right?

445
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,960
Well,
67,

446
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:59,210
the war on drugs came along.
The government became embarrassed that

447
00:23:59,211 --> 00:24:03,650
they had anything to do with this and
there was never any followup conference.

448
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,680
Right?
So I though that book that came out was

449
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:12,920
very influential to me.
It was one of the big influences in my

450
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:17,921
life as a 16 year old when I was just
getting interested in psychedelics.

451
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:23,150
So for many years I've wanted to do a
followup conference.

452
00:24:23,151 --> 00:24:26,960
I wanted to do it on the 30th
anniversary back in [inaudible] 97,

453
00:24:26,961 --> 00:24:31,760
but it never came together to do that.
So this is the 50th anniversary.

454
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,080
It's now or never.

455
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,120
And so it's now apparently we are gonna
do this thing and uh,

456
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,110
it's gonna be kind of much in the spirit
of the original conference.

457
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,440
Um,
we're not going to keep it completely

458
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,940
closed,
you know,

459
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:53,840
because we're not that kind of people.
There's not much,

460
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:58,280
not a lot of room for people to actually
come to the place that's going to be,

461
00:24:58,281 --> 00:25:00,680
which is this place called tearing ham
hall.

462
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,330
It's like,
it looks exactly like Downton Abbey.

463
00:25:05,331 --> 00:25:09,110
I mean it's a English country house,
beautiful place,

464
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,200
but not a place set up for a huge
conference.

465
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:17,201
They'll be maybe 10 guests stayed there
and a bunch of people staying close by,

466
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,720
but the point is not so much the people
attending.

467
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:23,390
It's going to be live streamed on
facebook,

468
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:27,680
which anyone can tune into that.
And uh,

469
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:32,770
then we're going to publish the
symposium volume for 2017 that everyone

470
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,230
who presents is going to submit a full
paper.

471
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:40,910
We're gonna publish that as volume two
will bring them out together as a deluxe

472
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:45,170
edition.
The first one which is available for

473
00:25:45,171 --> 00:25:48,620
free,
it's in the public domain and then the

474
00:25:48,621 --> 00:25:52,400
one from this conference and we'll,
we'll package them together as a

475
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:57,401
collector's edition and we're preselling
that now as part of the

476
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:04,540
strategy for I'm getting the money to
pay for this thing and we're doing okay,

477
00:26:05,661 --> 00:26:07,580
you know,
so I give you the website,

478
00:26:07,581 --> 00:26:10,640
it's Esp d,
fifty.com.

479
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:15,140
What is done for ethno pharmacologic
search for psychoactive drugs,

480
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,320
Fifty 50th anniversary.com.
And then there's also a facebook page

481
00:26:20,661 --> 00:26:23,180
which were the live streaming is going
to be.

482
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,720
So if you go there,
you can order the book,

483
00:26:26,721 --> 00:26:31,430
you can get the whole backstory,
you can sign up for the facebook live

484
00:26:31,431 --> 00:26:33,400
stream and so on.
And uh,

485
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,590
that's what we're gonna do.
And we've,

486
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,030
I've been very lucky.

487
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,080
Have,
you know,

488
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:42,890
some people,
you know how these conferences are,

489
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:47,400
you don't do it on your own.
When I sort of floated this idea,

490
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:49,920
a lot of people stepped up and said,
yeah,

491
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,170
I want to be involved.
All be involved,

492
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,440
not only people that are helping
organizing it,

493
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,990
but also people that are providing some
funding.

494
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:02,550
So now we have the money to pay people,
bringing them from all over the world.

495
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,140
There'll be about
18 presenters,

496
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,620
um,
uh,

497
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,960
and some really good people,
some very high profile people.

498
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:16,260
David Nichols will be there,
Mark Plotkin,

499
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:21,290
who runs the Amazon conservation team,
um,

500
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,120
a number of,
you know,

501
00:27:24,121 --> 00:27:28,770
those are maybe the two highest profile,
but people that are known in the field

502
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,000
and there's,
you know,

503
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:33,180
you can look at the website [inaudible]
dot com.

504
00:27:33,181 --> 00:27:37,350
You can look at the program and if it
appeals to you,

505
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,780
get on the uh,
you know,

506
00:27:39,781 --> 00:27:42,180
get on the live stream so that,
you know,

507
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:45,570
those technologies did not exist in
1967.

508
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:48,660
Right?
So they do now.

509
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,050
So why not let the world in,
you know,

510
00:27:52,051 --> 00:27:55,360
we can't have everybody come to
Buckingham Shyer,

511
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:58,560
but we can have them all over the world.
So that's the idea.

512
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,890
Well,
I'm sure the response to this is going

513
00:28:00,891 --> 00:28:04,050
to be tremendous.
If you can live stream it and live

514
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:06,000
streaming on facebook,
it's going to be huge.

515
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,560
I mean,
that's a great idea.

516
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,610
Well,
I hope so.

517
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,630
It is for sure.
It's an awesome use of the technology

518
00:28:12,631 --> 00:28:16,520
because there really isn't something
like that that people can tune into and

519
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:21,740
watch 18 different people speak and of
course it'll all be documented so it

520
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:25,080
will be archived,
will generate a dvt out of it,

521
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,260
but mainly it's the ball,
it's the books.

522
00:28:28,261 --> 00:28:32,970
I mean the idea of actually collecting
real physical books might seem like a

523
00:28:32,971 --> 00:28:37,200
quite 20th century idea to people and it
is,

524
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,580
we have to do it while you still can.

525
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,870
I like the idea of having a nice box
set.

526
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,220
Yeah.
But uh,

527
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:47,790
people don't have to get that.
They can get the single one.

528
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:52,110
They don't have to do anything.
If they're interested they could do it.

529
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,310
And so,
you know,

530
00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:00,510
thanks for letting me come out and let
people know about this and tweeting it

531
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,070
and so on.
This is all.

532
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,580
This is all very helpful and it looks
like there's going to be a lot of

533
00:29:05,581 --> 00:29:09,240
response.
And then of course the psychedelic

534
00:29:09,241 --> 00:29:11,700
science conferences coming up and we
have,

535
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,100
you know,
the symposium symposium guys there.

536
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,270
They're running the stage at the maps
conference,

537
00:29:21,271 --> 00:29:23,490
the,
a stage in the marketplace.

538
00:29:23,491 --> 00:29:27,960
So I'm going to be on there and they're
collaborating with us to on this

539
00:29:27,961 --> 00:29:31,020
project.
So I'm pretty excited about it.

540
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,270
Now.
How do you organize the 18 different

541
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:37,170
people that are talking and the subjects
so there's no overlap and so that,

542
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:37,980
you know,
the,

543
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,410
the message becomes,
stays vibrant,

544
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,200
will it?

545
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,220
It hasn't really been a problem.
I mean,

546
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,560
for one thing,
you know,

547
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:50,320
I pretty much knew who I wanted to come
and I know what their specialty is.

548
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:54,730
So I invited these people and they cover
a variety of specialties.

549
00:29:54,731 --> 00:29:59,731
So not really too much duplication.
Everyone brings something unique,

550
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:03,220
their own perspective.
Um,

551
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,120
you know,
so it's,

552
00:30:06,121 --> 00:30:07,930
it's pretty easy really.
I mean,

553
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:12,931
the idea of the ethno pharmacologic
search for psychoactive drugs is the

554
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:15,820
apt,
you know,

555
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:18,370
we want it to focus on the frontier of
this.

556
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:21,520
This is still a very active area and we,
we don't want,

557
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,820
you know,
not another conference about Iowasca not

558
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:25,663
on the,
you know,

559
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,660
and that's all wonderful and I'm totally
behind it.

560
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,420
And in fact,
truth in advertising,

561
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:36,540
we got four talks on Iowasca,
but different aspects of Iowasca that

562
00:30:37,391 --> 00:30:40,540
haven't really been discussed so much at
conferences.

563
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:43,900
And then we have,
we do have one gentleman talking about

564
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:45,820
Kratom,
uh,

565
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,440
and uh,
you know,

566
00:30:47,441 --> 00:30:52,441
a specialist of ethno pharmacologist
talking about that we have,

567
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:58,050
can alper who is maybe the REC worlds
recognized authority on Iboga or

568
00:31:00,071 --> 00:31:03,640
Ibogaine and from the pharmacology
chemical,

569
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,280
clinical side,
we've got him,

570
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,540
we've got to Dave Nichols,
uh,

571
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,650
we have,
uh,

572
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,080
another,
uh,

573
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:13,140
person,
uh,

574
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,320
another,
uh,

575
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:18,070
phytochemistry talking about Salvia
divinorum.

576
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:22,390
Um,
so these are things that we're not even

577
00:31:22,391 --> 00:31:23,830
on the radar,
you know,

578
00:31:23,831 --> 00:31:27,850
in 1967.
And that's kind of the idea that there's

579
00:31:27,851 --> 00:31:32,851
been 50 years more work at a lot of work
and never any followup conferences.

580
00:31:33,131 --> 00:31:37,510
So that's the excuse for doing this.
This will be the followup conference and

581
00:31:37,511 --> 00:31:42,511
if it gets momentum then maybe we'll be
able to do number three and number four.

582
00:31:43,391 --> 00:31:45,430
Well,
probably by the time number four comes

583
00:31:45,431 --> 00:31:48,100
around,
I'll be drooling in my oatmeal,

584
00:31:48,101 --> 00:31:52,640
so I may not have much to do with that.
There's going to be some new science.

585
00:31:52,641 --> 00:31:54,250
It's going to kick you right back into
gear.

586
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,490
Let's hope so.
There's a lot going on right now.

587
00:31:56,491 --> 00:32:00,010
Hold it on for.
I think you're catching the wave at the

588
00:32:00,011 --> 00:32:01,140
right time,
Dennis.

589
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,170
Sometimes I wonder,
but you know,

590
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,780
I'm super positive for you.
Um,

591
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,980
what is the status of Salvia Salvia
divinorum?

592
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:16,360
What is the legal status?
Salvia divinorum is more or less legal

593
00:32:16,361 --> 00:32:18,430
on the federal level.
It's still sold.

594
00:32:18,431 --> 00:32:22,160
I think a few states have banned it.
Uh,

595
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,780
I'm not sure which states how funny that
it's the opposite way,

596
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,000
you know,
most things are federally illegal and

597
00:32:28,001 --> 00:32:30,490
then the states legalize them like
marijuana at least,

598
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,810
but salvias for people to know.
Super Potent Psychedelic,

599
00:32:34,811 --> 00:32:38,680
super potent.
And I'm super bizarre,

600
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:42,650
very weird.
And I think maybe that's kind of the

601
00:32:42,651 --> 00:32:47,651
built in a built in
protection against abuse because a lot

602
00:32:49,311 --> 00:32:51,260
of people don't care for it,
you know,

603
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:54,620
it's like once isn't enough.
Never again many pI.

604
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:58,280
mean,
this is not something that you're likely

605
00:32:58,281 --> 00:33:00,070
to get addicted to,
you know,

606
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:05,120
unless you're just a very peculiar,
because it's dysphoric,

607
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,240
you know,
it's not pleasant.

608
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:11,570
Most people find it quite,
quite unpleasant,

609
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,390
even terrifying.
Um,

610
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,410
well,
years back.

611
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,820
But I think one,
one of the,

612
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,700
one of the things that protects against,
if people smoke it,

613
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:24,260
which is not the traditional way at all,
but again,

614
00:33:24,261 --> 00:33:28,340
it's like it minutes.
The traditional way is you choose a

615
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:33,341
fresh leaves and it's the sage.
It's some variation of the sage plant,

616
00:33:33,531 --> 00:33:34,341
correct.
It's,

617
00:33:34,341 --> 00:33:36,440
um,
it is a sage or a mint.

618
00:33:36,441 --> 00:33:39,620
It's in the mint family and yeah,
it's called the sage,

619
00:33:39,621 --> 00:33:42,230
but it's really a mint.
I always wondered if there was some sort

620
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:44,900
of correlation between the name's sage,
meaning wisdom,

621
00:33:44,901 --> 00:33:46,370
you know,
and then this stuff.

622
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,170
No,
just total bum luck.

623
00:33:48,171 --> 00:33:50,420
Some would like you to think.
So I think.

624
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:53,960
I think Daniel Siebert,
who's one of the specialists,

625
00:33:53,961 --> 00:33:58,961
he has a website called sage wisdom.org
or.com and good stuff.

626
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:01,760
He's,
he's into Kratom.

627
00:34:01,761 --> 00:34:03,410
He provides,
I mean,

628
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,930
Salvia.
He provides good information on it

629
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,150
there.
Most people,

630
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:11,900
at least my own experience in many
people,

631
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,220
it's like,
well,

632
00:34:13,221 --> 00:34:14,180
it's interesting.

633
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:19,180
It's profoundly strange.
And what do you bring back from it?

634
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,500
You know,
that's the question.

635
00:34:21,501 --> 00:34:26,450
What do you bring back from it?
I think that's partly why,

636
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:28,580
you know,
most people are,

637
00:34:28,581 --> 00:34:30,770
they don't,
they don't seek it out.

638
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:34,910
Particularly my friends are people that
do like it.

639
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,410
I know a lot of people that do.
Yeah,

640
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,710
I don't.
I only did it once and I had this very

641
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:41,870
bizarre out of body experience.
But,

642
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,010
uh,
I don't think I took enough.

643
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,570
I had a friend,
Ari,

644
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,410
who took a lot who over the course of 10
minutes lived,

645
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,160
maybe he,
he believes in the neighborhood of five

646
00:34:52,161 --> 00:34:57,161
to six months and in this dimension
where you had a life and he had friends

647
00:34:57,651 --> 00:35:02,651
and he had a job and relationships and
he went through this and came back and

648
00:35:05,091 --> 00:35:06,500
you know,
10 minutes later he's like,

649
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,960
this is going to be impossible to
describe,

650
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:09,810
but I,
I,

651
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:14,810
I lived a life I had like this
alternative reality that I went through

652
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,450
for multiple months.

653
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,540
Those,
those kinds of experiences,

654
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,720
believe it or not,
are not that uncommon mountain Salvia,

655
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:28,790
somebody told me once they had the
experience where you know they were in a

656
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:32,630
place,
they were like seven or eight years old.

657
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,870
It was Christmas morning.
They were at the Christmas trees

658
00:35:35,871 --> 00:35:39,990
celebrating Christmas,
opening the presents with a family that

659
00:35:39,991 --> 00:35:44,991
this guy had no connection to the team
and like,

660
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,460
what do you make of that?
I mean,

661
00:35:47,461 --> 00:35:51,540
I think Salvia is interesting in that,
in that regard,

662
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:52,260
in that,
you know,

663
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,270
some of these ones that
don't,

664
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,600
they're worth exploring.
Right?

665
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,560
I mean if you can distort time or
actually go into,

666
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:04,230
you know,
parallel dimensions or whatever that's

667
00:36:04,231 --> 00:36:07,350
looking into.
I think it takes more intrepid

668
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:11,490
psychonauts than I am to look into that.
But I would encourage people to

669
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,950
carefully explore this.
You know,

670
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:19,040
years ago when I first explored DMT,
you could get five Meo dmt online.

671
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:24,810
There was a chemical company you could
buy it and I bought like a,

672
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:29,130
like a jug of it,
like a container of it,

673
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,160
like the size of this Stevia container,
which is for people don't know enough to

674
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:39,420
get high for the rest of your life.
DMT once a month for the rest of you and

675
00:36:39,421 --> 00:36:40,770
that's all you want to do.
By the way,

676
00:36:40,771 --> 00:36:45,771
especially five meo five meo brings you
to someplace that feels like the

677
00:36:46,861 --> 00:36:51,570
ultimate center of the universe and
there's nothing and it's you.

678
00:36:51,571 --> 00:36:53,300
You're a part of the whole.
It's,

679
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,650
it's also no visuals which is really
weird.

680
00:36:55,651 --> 00:37:00,330
Or if it is a visual,
it's like these opaque geometric

681
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:05,331
patterns that exist in this bizarre
white and you just cease to exist and it

682
00:37:05,581 --> 00:37:09,570
feels terrifying and strange and you
know,

683
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,760
again,
there's no accounting for taste.

684
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,020
I,
I agree.

685
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:17,430
It is like that.
There are no visuals so that's something

686
00:37:17,431 --> 00:37:22,431
strange about it,
but many people feel like if it puts you

687
00:37:22,831 --> 00:37:25,860
in this void place or the zero energy
point.

688
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,230
I don't know if you've had James Orac on
here.

689
00:37:28,231 --> 00:37:31,110
No.
He wrote the book tryptamine palace.

690
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:35,350
No,
which is all about five methoxy dmt with

691
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,960
how do you spell his last name?
Uh,

692
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:40,110
Orac,
O r o c k,

693
00:37:40,111 --> 00:37:43,650
I think the name of his book is
tryptamine palace.

694
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,320
And they,
you know,

695
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:50,590
his thing is five methoxy and has thing,
Huh?

696
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,280
Now,
uh,

697
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:55,200
and,
and it's an interesting book.

698
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:58,360
And now you know,
the Sonoran towed,

699
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,380
right?
You've heard that.

700
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:04,910
That's five methoxy toad.
You excrete something on like glass,

701
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,320
you excrete the venom,
you actually have to torture the toad a

702
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,840
little bit,
uh,

703
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:15,090
or squeeze the venom which is in the
parotid glands.

704
00:38:15,091 --> 00:38:19,170
You squeeze it out on a slide,
dry it out,

705
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:24,230
and then you can smoke it.
That's about 11 to 15 percent,

706
00:38:24,631 --> 00:38:26,080
five mil.
But it's,

707
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:30,570
it's a heavy hit.
Do they know why this toad produces this

708
00:38:30,571 --> 00:38:31,140
in venom?

709
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,080
I mean,
is it psychoactive when you eat it low?

710
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:35,500
Who knows?
Who knows?

711
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:40,501
Most tolds
produced [inaudible],

712
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,660
right?
This is very close to five methoxy it.

713
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:48,880
And in fact it's named after the toads.
That genus of toads is Bufo,

714
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,280
right?
[inaudible] is found in most of these

715
00:38:51,281 --> 00:38:56,281
toads,
but bufo our various is the only species

716
00:38:57,341 --> 00:39:01,360
known that contains five methoxy DMT.
So it's got this Molech,

717
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:04,450
you know,
there's a probably single gene mutation

718
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,990
that lets it produced this methoxy
related,

719
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:11,500
a compound which is much stronger than
[inaudible] name.

720
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,590
Um,
and by the way,

721
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:19,620
just to caution people sometimes in the
media you hear about people are licking

722
00:39:19,811 --> 00:39:21,340
toads.
That's not going to do it.

723
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,410
No,
they're not liquid and toads,

724
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,410
they're smoking isn't aware that it just
gets,

725
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,660
tend to lick him because they,
they're nasty things that will be,

726
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,440
that will kill you if you look at the
pie,

727
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,380
realized,
yeah,

728
00:39:35,381 --> 00:39:37,840
these cardiac glycosides Oh God.

729
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:42,460
But pirate realizing it,
burning it destroys all those things so

730
00:39:42,461 --> 00:39:43,160
that,
that,

731
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,660
that it's okay to smoke it,
but it's definitely a dangerous tool.

732
00:39:46,661 --> 00:39:50,710
Lick it.
Most people don't like licking toads

733
00:39:50,711 --> 00:39:52,630
anyway.
That's probably.

734
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,830
Yeah.
That

735
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:00,480
various fairy tales is that the human
body produced five Meo DMT as well.

736
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:03,470
Oh yes.
Yeah.

737
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,180
And is it produced in the same area?
Like the liver and the lungs and

738
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:10,120
presumably the,
the pineal gland,

739
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,710
all of these things,
you know.

740
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,200
Uh,
yes it does.

741
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:19,260
There's a lot of controversy about
whether,

742
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,170
you know,
these endogenous tryptamines dmt

743
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:26,680
primarily,
but five vimeo is definitely there as

744
00:40:26,681 --> 00:40:28,810
well until they have a function.
You know,

745
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:33,900
there is a lot of speculation and not a
lot of facts about whether they actually

746
00:40:34,781 --> 00:40:37,210
have a function.
A,

747
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,080
I mean,
they're,

748
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,090
they're made.
And uh,

749
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,220
you know,
there's,

750
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,290
there's one school of thought that says,
yeah,

751
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,110
they're,
they're sorta like physiological noise,

752
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,480
you know,
they'll never reach a point where you

753
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:54,070
could actually perceive any effect
because the enzymes,

754
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,290
you know,
think kind of secular insight.

755
00:40:56,350 --> 00:41:01,330
We'll just chop up dmt very readily.
It's so close to human metabolism.

756
00:41:01,331 --> 00:41:04,090
It's not gonna,
it's gonna be very ephemeral in the

757
00:41:04,091 --> 00:41:06,280
system,
even if it is released,

758
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:12,450
but other people maintain that under
some circumstances the DMT can be stored

759
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:17,670
in vesicles and neuro vesicles and
released on demand or when some stimulus

760
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:24,570
leads to its release like stress,
some stress of some sort will go out and

761
00:41:24,971 --> 00:41:29,560
grab that painting that that young guy
sent the guy who has a pineal gland

762
00:41:29,561 --> 00:41:32,690
tumor who makes this really crazy trip
to mean art.

763
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:33,993
This guy,
I've

764
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:37,670
this guy,
this guy sent me one of his pieces and

765
00:41:37,671 --> 00:41:38,600
he,
uh,

766
00:41:38,601 --> 00:41:40,430
he has a tumor.
Do you know his name?

767
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,710
Jamie will,
we'll find his name.

768
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:46,100
I'll give this guy some some love,
but he,

769
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,310
he look at his artwork and you go,
oh yeah,

770
00:41:49,311 --> 00:41:50,710
that's what that is.
You know,

771
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,320
almost like Alex grey stuff.
But Alex Gray stuff is a,

772
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:56,810
it's art.
I mean,

773
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:59,390
it's definitely representative of the
tryptamine world.

774
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,760
It's beautiful and fantastic and
amazing.

775
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,870
Right?
But it's art.

776
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:08,260
This guy's stuff seems like a trip,
but it gets the chaos of the tryptamine

777
00:42:08,961 --> 00:42:11,570
experience is sort of replicated in his
artwork.

778
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,793
Yeah,
that's it.

779
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,470
And so this young guy,
what we'll find out his name,

780
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,730
um,
he,

781
00:42:16,731 --> 00:42:17,870
uh,
he sent this.

782
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,830
I first heard of have this gentleman
from the.

783
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,590
Holy Moly,
take a look at this.

784
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,160
Yeah.
I first heard of this guy from John.

785
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:27,860
Oh,
Hiya.

786
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,540
Who organized this?
Alex?

787
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:34,160
A up.
I don't think there is enough.

788
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:39,680
So I think this is a,
this is a zero gravity environment.

789
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,730
Any way that you want it to be.
This is pretty amazing.

790
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,470
That's amazing.
Wow.

791
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,191
Yeah.
Well,

792
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:49,190
I'm waiting for the.
We're building a new studio and when

793
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,800
that's done,
we'll have this up prominently featured,

794
00:42:51,801 --> 00:42:54,290
but this kid's work is just incredible.
Jamie,

795
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:56,030
see if you could find it.
Who He is,

796
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,980
but he should be.
Is He?

797
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:03,020
I hope he's healthy letting himself be
looked at by medical people.

798
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,760
I think he's just happy to be tripping
all the time.

799
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:10,010
This is going to leave about science.
Sean Thornton.

800
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:12,710
Shout out.
Shout out to Sean Thornton.

801
00:43:12,711 --> 00:43:13,670
Yeah,
there's this work there.

802
00:43:13,671 --> 00:43:14,960
It is.
Artists got cancer.

803
00:43:14,961 --> 00:43:17,000
The pineal gland is paintings will leave
you speechless.

804
00:43:17,001 --> 00:43:18,620
Yes.
They will say,

805
00:43:18,621 --> 00:43:19,430
well,
Sean,

806
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,050
third storton.
Sean Thornton.

807
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,540
Amazing.
Yeah.

808
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:27,720
His stuff is incredible and apparently,
well,

809
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:30,170
he's in,
at least in some sort of way,

810
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:33,140
anecdotal evidence that it's produced in
the pineal gland.

811
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,750
Of course,
the Cottonwood Research Foundation that

812
00:43:35,751 --> 00:43:39,650
Dr Rick Strassman is a part of in his
amazing work from DMT,

813
00:43:39,651 --> 00:43:40,670
the spirit molecule,
of course,

814
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:43,460
the documentary that you and I were in,
his,

815
00:43:43,461 --> 00:43:46,090
uh,
his work has shown that it's a,

816
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:49,160
it is produced by the pineal gland in
live rats.

817
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:53,030
So we know now for a fact that at least
in that mammal,

818
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:54,860
it's a,
it's produced in the pineal gland,

819
00:43:54,861 --> 00:43:57,500
but that's always been for people that,
uh,

820
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,500
you know,
I went to the Vatican last summer and

821
00:44:00,501 --> 00:44:02,790
I'm,
one of the really cool things was the

822
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:07,910
giant pine cone that they have in the
center of one of the outer areas.

823
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:14,950
And I was really lucky to have a very
good guide who is a professor.

824
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:19,700
And he was explaining to me that that
was representative of the pineal gland.

825
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,460
And uh,
yeah,

826
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:25,640
it was really fascinating because
there's this enormous pine cone and it's

827
00:44:25,641 --> 00:44:29,510
surrounded by these two peacocks are two
peacocks on the side there where they're

828
00:44:29,511 --> 00:44:32,130
supposed to represent a mortality,
some sort of a strange way.

829
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:35,820
So I don't know what that whole vision
was supposed to mean,

830
00:44:35,821 --> 00:44:38,230
but he was very adamant that that pine
cone there,

831
00:44:38,231 --> 00:44:42,420
you see it up there on the screen that,
that is representative of the pineal

832
00:44:42,421 --> 00:44:47,280
gland and also in ancient Egypt and a
lot of the hieroglyphs you see that as

833
00:44:47,281 --> 00:44:48,120
well,
right?

834
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:49,321
Well,
yeah,

835
00:44:49,321 --> 00:44:52,890
pineal itself means because it is shaped
like a pine cone.

836
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,860
That's why,
that's why it's named that.

837
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:58,620
But I have no idea.
That is very interesting.

838
00:44:58,650 --> 00:44:59,640
Yeah.
Was pretty fascinating.

839
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:03,420
What was also fascinating was this guy,
although he knew that that was

840
00:45:03,421 --> 00:45:06,900
representative of the pineal gland,
he did not know that the pineal pineal

841
00:45:06,901 --> 00:45:09,810
gland produce dmt.
He wasn't even aware of what the EMT

842
00:45:09,811 --> 00:45:10,644
was.
Right.

843
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:13,800
So he and I had this really cool
conversation about it where it was like,

844
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:17,340
what know this crazy Italian accent,
this is amazing.

845
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,570
And he's writing things down and I'm
writing to telling him about strassman's

846
00:45:21,571 --> 00:45:24,960
work and you and your brother and all
these different things to look into and

847
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:26,950
you know,
there is a.

848
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,070
my wife was rolling her eyes like,
oh Jesus,

849
00:45:29,071 --> 00:45:29,970
not this shit again.

850
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,580
You just have happy taken out in public
joe.

851
00:45:35,581 --> 00:45:40,080
You always embarrassed when she just.
She knew as soon as the guy said,

852
00:45:40,081 --> 00:45:42,150
pineal gland in my eyes lit up and I'm
like,

853
00:45:42,151 --> 00:45:44,520
here we go.
Let's talk about drugs.

854
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:50,040
Well,
there is a guy,

855
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:55,080
a couple of interesting people have to
mention in this context.

856
00:45:55,081 --> 00:45:57,640
One of them is a researcher

857
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,330
guy named Ed Frick.
Ska Ska.

858
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:02,860
How do you spell that?
Good question.

859
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:09,090
Ed.
F R e e C K S K,

860
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,200
I think I may have to correct myself on
that.

861
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:17,320
He's a pharmacologist and a
neurochemical,

862
00:46:17,321 --> 00:46:22,321
neuro chemist and psychiatrist.
But he is the one that's really kind of

863
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:28,081
leading the charge for endogenous
functions of DMT and has good evidence

864
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:31,810
which has been,
you know,

865
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,900
disputed by some.
I mean Dave Nichols is kind of on the

866
00:46:34,901 --> 00:46:36,190
other side.
He's like,

867
00:46:36,191 --> 00:46:36,970
ah,
dmt.

868
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:40,120
It doesn't have any internal function.
All these people are diluted,

869
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:43,310
you know,
that seems to me to be really cocky too.

870
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,960
Well,
I think that it's surprising that Dave

871
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:51,160
who's a very careful scientist would
have such,

872
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:54,130
you know,
such pre formed ideas,

873
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,640
very rigid idea.
Right.

874
00:46:56,110 --> 00:47:00,640
There's a conference in the UK at the
end of June called breaking convention,

875
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,560
which you may have heard of.
It's a big.

876
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:07,390
It's like a psychedelic conference.
Dave and the Ed are going to be there.

877
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:09,740
I'm going to be there.
Hopefully keeping them up.

878
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:10,743
I don't want any.

879
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:16,780
They're going to be talking about this
and doing into Beta on it.

880
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:19,640
Breaking Convention.
You might tell people to Google that.

881
00:47:19,641 --> 00:47:21,770
That's very interesting conference for
sure.

882
00:47:21,771 --> 00:47:26,060
What makes Dave so confident?
I mean when you consider the potency of

883
00:47:26,061 --> 00:47:30,070
it and the knowledge that that's
produced in the body and then also the

884
00:47:30,071 --> 00:47:32,590
knowledge of the effects of it,
which are just astounding.

885
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,020
Right?
How could anyone say that you know for

886
00:47:35,021 --> 00:47:37,190
sure.
Does he done it as David?

887
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,570
Of course he's it.
Could he do it and not go?

888
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,800
Okay.
What is this?

889
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,390
Well,
I think he does,

890
00:47:43,391 --> 00:47:47,110
but then there's also this very
reductionist side to him.

891
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:52,270
Then basically just as a pharmacologist,
he says it's never going to reach,

892
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,800
you know,
sufficient concentration in the plasma

893
00:47:56,801 --> 00:47:58,420
to have an effect.
However,

894
00:47:58,421 --> 00:48:01,210
I think he's wrong.
And I told him,

895
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,500
I mean,
I was teasing him,

896
00:48:02,501 --> 00:48:03,790
I was saying,
you know,

897
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,020
I,
I wrote back,

898
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,720
you know,
that famous phrase,

899
00:48:07,721 --> 00:48:11,290
the Arthur c dot Clark once said,
you know,

900
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,990
when,
when a distinguished but elderly

901
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:16,720
scientists says that something is
possible,

902
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:21,490
he's very likely correct when he says
it's impossible.

903
00:48:21,491 --> 00:48:23,110
He's almost certainly wrong.

904
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:27,810
Well,
when you're talking about that,

905
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:31,990
just general bio diversity of human
beings and how some people.

906
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:34,360
Let's talk about other human
neurochemistry,

907
00:48:34,361 --> 00:48:35,620
like,
like depression,

908
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:39,070
like some people are super happy and
have no problem with their dope,

909
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,780
meaner,
serotonin levels and there's other

910
00:48:40,781 --> 00:48:43,750
people that have real issues.
Yeah.

911
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,340
Well there is that,
right?

912
00:48:45,341 --> 00:48:48,490
So just look at that,
the variability of that,

913
00:48:48,491 --> 00:48:51,910
and then also how that can be
manipulated with exercise and all these

914
00:48:51,911 --> 00:48:53,800
other different things that can raise
those levels up.

915
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:57,790
What about the other thing,
like in terms of like holotropic

916
00:48:57,791 --> 00:49:01,980
breathing or all these different
shamonic breathing and yoga exercises?

917
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:03,550
Um,
Kundalini Yoga,

918
00:49:03,551 --> 00:49:06,030
which I haven't experienced it and
couldn't let Jonah,

919
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:10,900
but I did have a very bizarre experience
fairly recently on yoga where I went

920
00:49:10,901 --> 00:49:15,901
into class on a pretty pretty high dose
of cannabis and I started tripping in

921
00:49:16,511 --> 00:49:19,510
the middle of one of the more intense
poses.

922
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:24,930
It was just something akin to the very
beginnings of a dmt trip where I started

923
00:49:26,531 --> 00:49:30,040
seeing patterns and seeing things moving
and some sort of a.

924
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:34,530
It didn't go anywhere,
but I don't pursue it in terms of

925
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:38,920
attempting to make that happen.
But I would imagine that if it's made in

926
00:49:38,921 --> 00:49:40,580
the body and then the,
the,

927
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:43,930
the effects of it are reproducible when
you take it.

928
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:49,090
I mean taking dmt is a very few people
was a very small percentage that don't

929
00:49:49,661 --> 00:49:51,220
have an experience when they take it.
Right?

930
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,630
Very small percentage.
Do we know what that number is?

931
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:01,090
Probably something like.
I mean I would say a wild guess,

932
00:50:01,091 --> 00:50:05,320
but a two percent or something
anomalous.

933
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:09,310
Why should there be people who don't
have any effect?

934
00:50:09,311 --> 00:50:11,410
I mean,
that's a whole other question about

935
00:50:11,411 --> 00:50:16,090
what's strange about their metabolism,
but it's interesting that you raise this

936
00:50:16,091 --> 00:50:19,930
because a lot of these yoga techniques,
especially Kundalini,

937
00:50:19,931 --> 00:50:24,931
is probably about inducing dmt synthesis
in the pineal or wherever it occurs.

938
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:27,980
There's also a very

939
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,370
interesting technology that has come to
light.

940
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,360
I just found out about it last summer
called the adage know light.

941
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:38,840
Have you heard of this age?
A J.

942
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,380
A N a.
So write down on the light.com.

943
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,280
The Sky who's developed this very
interesting fellow.

944
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:51,910
He's named a guy heroin and uh,
he used to work for apple.

945
00:50:53,391 --> 00:50:57,740
He actually worked very closely with
Steve Jobs when Steve Jobs had next

946
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:01,100
computing.
So he's basically a computer programmer

947
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:04,670
and the engineer worked with Steve Jobs,
but then he,

948
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:09,700
for some reason he decided he had to
move to Thailand and become a zen monk,

949
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:13,760
which he did,
but he continued to work with technology

950
00:51:13,761 --> 00:51:16,490
and he developed this thing called the
original light,

951
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:21,670
which he claims induces dmt synthesis in
the pineal.

952
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,300
And uh,
I was at a conference last summer

953
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:30,350
actually tearing him at this place where
this one is going to be and he was

954
00:51:30,351 --> 00:51:31,184
there.

955
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,700
I tried it a couple of times.
And by Golly,

956
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,760
it's a lot like dmt dealing.
Yeah.

957
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:39,840
What is it?
It's,

958
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:40,723
it's just,
uh,

959
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:42,950
it looks like a floor lamp.
It's,

960
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,360
you know,
nothing.

961
00:51:44,361 --> 00:51:48,350
It's got a,
it's got this array of ld leds on a,

962
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:50,150
on a holder.
You lie under it.

963
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:55,280
And if they're just white leds and they
programs that from his ipad,

964
00:51:55,281 --> 00:52:00,281
I guess in different sequences,
but you lie under this thing for a few

965
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,860
minutes and pretty soon you get into the
zone,

966
00:52:03,861 --> 00:52:08,780
you know,
these visuals begin to manifest and it

967
00:52:08,781 --> 00:52:13,781
looks a great deal like dmt.
So them and he claims,

968
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,930
you know,
it's synthesizing dmt and the pineal and

969
00:52:17,931 --> 00:52:22,931
it is very much like dmt would be if
it's released at the site of action,

970
00:52:24,861 --> 00:52:27,300
because you know,
dmt is when you smoke it,

971
00:52:27,301 --> 00:52:30,170
it brings some big body load,
which you have to wear that goofy

972
00:52:30,171 --> 00:52:31,004
outfit.

973
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,730
What's with the orange outfit?
Seriously,

974
00:52:32,731 --> 00:52:37,340
I can tell that they're in Thailand.
I understand that.

975
00:52:37,341 --> 00:52:41,150
The expression of muchness the pious
outfit,

976
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,630
let it go folks just where wear a tee
shirt or whatever.

977
00:52:44,631 --> 00:52:48,380
I would just have to get into a,
you know,

978
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:52,670
into an econ student to do it.
But I wouldn't do it a couple times.

979
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,620
How many times did you do it?
Well,

980
00:52:54,621 --> 00:52:58,730
I was not there long enough to do.
I did it a couple times and this woman's

981
00:52:58,731 --> 00:53:02,000
setting is,
is just effective sitting as it as lying

982
00:53:02,001 --> 00:53:03,060
down.
Uh,

983
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,720
I couldn't tell you,
but I expect so you lie,

984
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:10,020
you lie down.
I laid down and close your eyes and know

985
00:53:10,021 --> 00:53:10,761
it well.
Yeah,

986
00:53:10,761 --> 00:53:13,610
you close your eyes.
Doesn't matter because it's coming

987
00:53:13,611 --> 00:53:15,640
through.
You don't have eyeshades on

988
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:22,150
and usually he's playing some music,
but then you know in me like the

989
00:53:22,821 --> 00:53:26,340
reductionist kicks in and says,
well guy,

990
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,420
this is interesting.

991
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:31,170
How do you know it's really dmt that
you're,

992
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:35,340
that you're stimulating.
And we've been going back and forth on

993
00:53:35,341 --> 00:53:37,540
that and how can you test that?
And there,

994
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:41,310
there are ways to do it,
but most of them involve some fairly

995
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:47,520
drastic procedures like you can do that
you wouldn't want to do on people

996
00:53:47,521 --> 00:53:50,370
because they wouldn't give you
permission if they had any sense.

997
00:53:50,371 --> 00:53:54,210
But you could do two rats,
you could do something called micro

998
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:57,300
dialysis,
you can put a centrally,

999
00:53:57,301 --> 00:53:59,500
a microscopic,
a

1000
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:06,110
tube that's absorbed the next to the
pineal and you can collect samples that

1001
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,750
you detect.
This is not something that people would

1002
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:12,420
volunteer for.
How about just take,

1003
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:16,020
take your word for it?
Well I just want to know does it really

1004
00:54:16,021 --> 00:54:18,570
reduce it or not?
I am not saying it does,

1005
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,870
but it's a lot like dmt.
What about hovering something like that

1006
00:54:21,871 --> 00:54:24,970
over a sensory deprivation tank,
like being inside of it and having it

1007
00:54:24,971 --> 00:54:29,220
hover over your head so you have the
added experience of out of body with

1008
00:54:29,221 --> 00:54:29,640
that.

1009
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:33,640
I mean I would think that'd be pretty
intense and not hard to recreate.

1010
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,540
Probably not you.
Probably what you'd probably want to do

1011
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:38,790
with that,
this to have some kind of goggles

1012
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:43,230
essentially that could be connected to
his,

1013
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:45,990
to his program by Bluetooth or
something,

1014
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:49,170
so then you're wearing the goggles,
you're in the isolation tank,

1015
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:53,790
but if you just hover it over your head,
if you just have an arm like a computer

1016
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:59,030
monitor arm and just swing it over the
head and so you turned it on,

1017
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:00,360
close the door,
the 10,

1018
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:03,840
close your eyes,
lay back and maybe it has like a 32nd

1019
00:55:03,841 --> 00:55:07,140
window or lets you settle in.
You then begins the program.

1020
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:11,160
Lots of ways you could approach it.
That just seems to me doing really ramp

1021
00:55:11,161 --> 00:55:13,140
it up.
Now here's the question.

1022
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:17,700
Interesting though.
This is just one of an array of,

1023
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:21,510
you know what you might call
neurotechnology is you know,

1024
00:55:21,511 --> 00:55:23,580
or even spiritual technologies.

1025
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:26,340
Maybe this'll make psychedelics
obsolete.

1026
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:28,290
Well,
this is a great way that you could do it

1027
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:31,680
without actually having to hold onto an
illegal drug.

1028
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,190
Exactly.
Does.

1029
00:55:33,191 --> 00:55:36,360
You're carrying your illegal drug with
you so far,

1030
00:55:36,361 --> 00:55:38,970
they can arrest you for that.
Although I'm sure they're trying to

1031
00:55:38,971 --> 00:55:41,670
figure out a way that was your brother's
classic line.

1032
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:46,671
Everyone's holding everyone's holding
now with this stuff.

1033
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,970
Um,
did you experience the communication

1034
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,690
that you get with DMT?
Because that to me has always been the

1035
00:55:54,691 --> 00:55:58,830
most profound aspect of it.
Is this feeling that I'm in the presence

1036
00:55:58,831 --> 00:56:03,831
of something and then they sort of
telekinetic understanding the words but

1037
00:56:04,441 --> 00:56:07,380
not hearing the words.
Honestly,

1038
00:56:07,381 --> 00:56:11,490
I didn't get that because I think I was
not under long enough.

1039
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,480
I didn't have much time.
So I was only under each time it was

1040
00:56:15,481 --> 00:56:17,760
under maybe 20 minutes,
which isn't.

1041
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:23,070
I think if I'd stayed in that place,
if I could settle into it for an hour,

1042
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:25,750
I think that probably would manifest,
you know,

1043
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:28,920
and uh,
Diana is what,

1044
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:30,640
why do you think this,
why do you think would change?

1045
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,850
Takes Awhile for the,
for the thing to fully,

1046
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,380
you know,
uh,

1047
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:41,500
whatever the term is for,
if it is dmt for the DM t to reach a

1048
00:56:44,621 --> 00:56:47,290
critical level where you're seeing that
kind of stuff,

1049
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:50,350
you feel this because it was ramping up
during your experience.

1050
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,980
I felt like it was that if I had stuck
around,

1051
00:56:53,981 --> 00:56:55,840
I thought it would,
uh,

1052
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,170
you know,
I thought it would develop and we've

1053
00:56:59,171 --> 00:57:00,910
talked about too,
we've talked about,

1054
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,900
you know,
thinking about how to establish that

1055
00:57:04,901 --> 00:57:09,730
this really is dmt and other approach
that we've tried is to take a or the

1056
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,280
guys tried.
I don't have access to the light,

1057
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:14,410
I can't afford it,
but guys,

1058
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:19,830
it costs about 3,300 bucks,
you know,

1059
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:24,250
which is not bad,
but beyond my pay grade,

1060
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,940
I'm going to buy for you for a present,
buy it and keep it.

1061
00:57:27,941 --> 00:57:29,160
You're going to buy two of them.

1062
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:32,080
I'll buy one for you and me will
correspond.

1063
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:33,490
All right.
All right,

1064
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:38,500
well now we're going to do that.
I might mention that the guy is offering

1065
00:57:38,501 --> 00:57:42,370
a conference special here.
If you don't have to wear the outfit.

1066
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,870
Yeah.
No you don't.

1067
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:47,110
You don't.
You'll get a discount on it.

1068
00:57:47,111 --> 00:57:50,710
If you go through the facebook site,
which I'm about to put this beautiful,

1069
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:55,690
we can talk about this offline,
but through facebook some portion of it

1070
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,050
will go toward supporting this
conference.

1071
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,710
So I would love that.
I'm very curious about this because I'm,

1072
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:05,170
I know that I have a good buddy of mine,
my friend Danny,

1073
00:58:05,171 --> 00:58:10,000
who's done a Kundalini for quite a long
time and he can reproduce dmt states.

1074
00:58:10,001 --> 00:58:14,470
He's actually had dmt experiences
independently of the Kundalini and he

1075
00:58:14,471 --> 00:58:16,870
says it's the same thing.
He says he can get there and I believe

1076
00:58:16,871 --> 00:58:17,590
him.

1077
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:19,780
I just too lazy or something.
I don't know what it is.

1078
00:58:19,781 --> 00:58:21,670
I just,
I'm not inclined.

1079
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,880
Well,
I think there's a genetic component,

1080
00:58:23,881 --> 00:58:25,520
you know,
I mean like this gentleman,

1081
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:30,100
although he has a tumor [inaudible],
I'm not sure why.

1082
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:34,480
Maybe he doesn't want medical people
poking and prodding him,

1083
00:58:34,481 --> 00:58:38,350
but he would be a perfect subject to
settle a lot of issues.

1084
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:41,340
She was willing to,
you know,

1085
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,990
cooperate.
I mean just having a look at his

1086
00:58:43,991 --> 00:58:46,630
cerebral spinal fluid,
which would be the obvious,

1087
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:50,440
you know,
fluid to sample for this would be very

1088
00:58:50,441 --> 00:58:51,430
interesting.
Yeah.

1089
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:54,100
But I could understand his reluctance.
If he has reluctance.

1090
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:58,360
People are drilling into your dome,
Kinda suck out brain juice.

1091
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:01,750
Does it sound fun?
But it is interesting though,

1092
00:59:01,751 --> 00:59:06,751
that these compounds are in,
in some way a part of normal human

1093
00:59:07,271 --> 00:59:10,150
neurochemistry and why?
Right.

1094
00:59:10,151 --> 00:59:11,590
And Dave Nichols,
what does he believe?

1095
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:15,100
Well,
I don't know if he believes anything.

1096
00:59:15,101 --> 00:59:16,110
He just,
you know,

1097
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,660
he just,
you know,

1098
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:21,170
he just,
just skeptical that,

1099
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:26,320
that in normal physiological processes,
dmt has much of a function.

1100
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:30,020
What about dreams?
Dreams are a possibility and that's

1101
00:59:30,021 --> 00:59:31,190
always been the big one.
Right.

1102
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:34,010
That's always been the big one.
And it's totally plausible.

1103
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:37,090
You'll have to get him on here.
Tim,

1104
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:38,600
explain it.
I would love to.

1105
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:40,540
I mean,
uh,

1106
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:42,560
you know,
I'm not sure.

1107
00:59:42,561 --> 00:59:47,150
He just has this idea that I think for
one thing,

1108
00:59:47,151 --> 00:59:47,990
I think,
you know,

1109
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:50,860
he's kind of a reductionist guy.
I think the,

1110
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:55,650
all the new age stuff,
the new excitement about the empty them,

1111
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:58,070
hi Neil and all that.
It kind of puts them off.

1112
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:03,630
But on the other hand,
don't assume that we know everything.

1113
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,210
In fact,
we know nothing,

1114
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:06,770
you know.
And if it's there,

1115
01:00:06,771 --> 01:00:08,540
I think it probably does have a
function,

1116
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:12,590
you know,
it's not surprising that it's there,

1117
01:00:12,591 --> 01:00:13,610
it's everywhere.

1118
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:17,450
I mean it's,
it's DMT is interesting molecule because

1119
01:00:17,451 --> 01:00:19,520
it's two steps from Tryptofan,
right?

1120
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:23,780
Tryptophan is an amino acid and the
essential amino acid,

1121
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:29,320
one of the 20 that goes into proteins.
So tryptophan is an every living thing

1122
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:34,390
on this planet and there are two enzymes
that are also pretty much universal in

1123
01:00:35,871 --> 01:00:40,871
cells that can convert dmt or Tryptofan
to dmt in two simple steps.

1124
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:44,240
You know,
I don't want to get too into the

1125
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:48,080
chemistry,
but basically you remove the amino acid

1126
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:51,860
portion of the amino acid,
you get tryptamine and from there you

1127
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,980
add the methyl groups and there you are.
You know,

1128
01:00:55,160 --> 01:01:00,160
which is why DMT is a very,
very common in plants for example.

1129
01:01:01,521 --> 01:01:03,390
And Anna Animals.
I mean I,

1130
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:08,500
I tell people nature is drenched in dmt.
Drenched is a great transcribe DMT.

1131
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:13,990
There are thousands and thousands and
thousands of species of plants that

1132
01:01:14,481 --> 01:01:16,490
contain DMT for sure.

1133
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,440
You know,
I mean they haven't,

1134
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:22,310
there hasn't been any survey or anything
like that.

1135
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:25,910
But if you look at the gender that have
a lot of DMT,

1136
01:01:25,911 --> 01:01:30,380
like Acacia is a good example.
The Australian acacias are some of the

1137
01:01:30,381 --> 01:01:35,381
strongest sources of DMT.
There's 1700 species of vacation,

1138
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:42,880
probably 75 percent of them contain DMT
and I'm sure you're aware of the Israeli

1139
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:48,170
scientists that believe that the story
of Noah,

1140
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:52,160
it's not Moses rather,
and the burning Bush was the Acacia tree

1141
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:57,140
and they think that that was the,
the confusion of all the translations.

1142
01:01:57,141 --> 01:01:59,600
And of course the oral history passed
down over many,

1143
01:01:59,601 --> 01:02:01,490
many years.
Then finally written down.

1144
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:06,260
But this idea of the burning Bush
delivering the word of God was most

1145
01:02:06,261 --> 01:02:11,000
likely in some way a psychedelic trip
induced by DMT and most likely because

1146
01:02:11,001 --> 01:02:14,190
of the acacia tree,
most likely the acacia tree,

1147
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:16,460
because that was in the area,
the,

1148
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:20,460
you know,
I mean an interesting idea.

1149
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:22,590
And the,
and it's interesting that the,

1150
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:23,960
uh,
you know,

1151
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:29,000
sort of the way that the burning Bush
presented itself was like dmt presents

1152
01:02:29,911 --> 01:02:32,760
itself.
You cannot take your eyes away from it,

1153
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:34,880
but at the same time you cannot look at.

1154
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:38,820
But Pharma,
you don't even know what you're saying.

1155
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:42,820
There was this something that he smoked
was in incense.

1156
01:02:42,821 --> 01:02:44,960
I was,
he exposed to this and uh,

1157
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:48,060
you know,
because that will make a difference

1158
01:02:48,061 --> 01:02:52,320
because you can't eat dmt because it's
destroyed by monoamine oxidase.

1159
01:02:52,321 --> 01:02:56,160
Right.
That's the whole basis of Iowasca in

1160
01:02:56,161 --> 01:02:59,430
terms of these Acacias,
you know,

1161
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:01,260
the question comes up also.
We'll.

1162
01:03:01,261 --> 01:03:03,840
Okay.
Most of them are native to Australia.

1163
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:08,670
So did the aborigines know about this
and if you look at their art,

1164
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:10,890
it's like,
looks like dmt.

1165
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:14,470
It's very psychedelic art.
I haven't really looked at very much

1166
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:18,930
point to list kind of designs in
aboriginal art.

1167
01:03:18,931 --> 01:03:22,050
I mean they're extremely psychedelics if
you could find some of that.

1168
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:24,790
But they,
the uh,

1169
01:03:24,850 --> 01:03:28,410
the aborigines,
I think they had to know about it.

1170
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:33,220
They're just not talking about it,
but one possible way that they could

1171
01:03:33,221 --> 01:03:36,570
have used it because the dmt and the
acacias is so high.

1172
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:39,390
The leaves,
some of these cases there are two

1173
01:03:39,391 --> 01:03:41,640
percent dmt.
Wow.

1174
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:46,730
So if you were to take leaves and throw
them on a fire in a enclosed space,

1175
01:03:47,761 --> 01:03:52,440
like a sweat lodge type space,
you could potentially get quite loaded

1176
01:03:52,441 --> 01:03:54,960
on dmt.
There's no indication that they smoked

1177
01:03:54,961 --> 01:03:58,620
stuff,
but they may have fumigated themselves

1178
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,060
with tmt.
Oh,

1179
01:04:00,061 --> 01:04:02,640
that completely makes sense.
If you're talking about a burning Bush.

1180
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:03,481
Yeah.
Well,

1181
01:04:03,481 --> 01:04:04,490
exactly.
And that's.

1182
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,750
How does that make its way to Israel
though?

1183
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:08,660
Well,
maybe this,

1184
01:04:09,090 --> 01:04:11,700
who knows,
who knows where anything makes its way.

1185
01:04:11,701 --> 01:04:14,340
Anyway,
these folks technologies,

1186
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:17,760
it's interesting.
If you look at the,

1187
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,550
uh,
if you look at the new world,

1188
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:22,010
you know,
in,

1189
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,780
in the,
in the historical sense,

1190
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:29,100
people have remarked,
why are there so more so many more

1191
01:04:29,101 --> 01:04:31,890
psychedelic plants in the new world and
old world,

1192
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:36,980
right?
It's something about people people's

1193
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:41,070
relationship to plants in this very high
biodiversity environment.

1194
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:43,410
People are mucking around with plants,
right?

1195
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:49,460
Like a perpetual question that comes up
is how did they figure out how to

1196
01:04:51,481 --> 01:04:56,481
combine banisteriopsis and CITCO trick
to get the activity of Iowasca?

1197
01:04:57,991 --> 01:05:01,470
How out of 80,000 species and the Amazon
did they figure out.

1198
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:05,280
Can you guys please,
to the uninitiated,

1199
01:05:05,281 --> 01:05:07,250
why,
why that's important with the model you

1200
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:08,011
not?
Well,

1201
01:05:08,011 --> 01:05:12,330
it's important because banisteriopsis
contains these alkaloids called Beta

1202
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:15,480
lanes that are monoamine oxidase
inhibitors,

1203
01:05:15,481 --> 01:05:20,481
and monoamine oxidase is the enzyme in
the gut that breaks down Dmt,

1204
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:26,740
so you can drink tea with dmt in it,
you can eat it all day.

1205
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:31,770
Nothing's going to happen because this
enzyme will inactivate it.

1206
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:35,560
And that's probably a reflection of an
evolutionary process,

1207
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:38,260
you know,
we've adapted to toxins in our

1208
01:05:38,261 --> 01:05:39,820
environment basically.
But,

1209
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:43,480
uh,
if you inhibit that with the alkaloids

1210
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:46,120
from the banisteriopsis,
they're very potent,

1211
01:05:46,121 --> 01:05:51,121
very selective Mao inhibitors that
protects it from degradation in the gut.

1212
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:55,570
It can cross into the blood and into the
blood brain barrier.

1213
01:05:55,571 --> 01:06:00,571
So that's the basis of the oral activity
and people make much about how they sort

1214
01:06:04,121 --> 01:06:07,060
of stumbled on this combination.
Right?

1215
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:10,120
And in fact,
one of our presenters at this

1216
01:06:10,121 --> 01:06:13,450
conference,
Manuel Torres as an archeologist,

1217
01:06:13,451 --> 01:06:15,970
has been looking at this for,
for quite a while.

1218
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:19,570
If,
and this is a,

1219
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:22,240
you know,
this is one of the sort of Gee whiz

1220
01:06:22,241 --> 01:06:24,350
things.
How did these primitive people figure

1221
01:06:24,351 --> 01:06:26,380
out how to combine these plants?
Right.

1222
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:29,530
I agree with remarkable.
If you talk to the Shaman and they'll

1223
01:06:29,531 --> 01:06:29,921
say,
well,

1224
01:06:29,921 --> 01:06:33,700
the plants told us,
but what does that mean?

1225
01:06:33,701 --> 01:06:37,420
You know,
and but what,

1226
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:42,160
what is interesting to me in a way or
what I've been thinking about lately,

1227
01:06:42,161 --> 01:06:44,260
if you look at the archeology of these
things,

1228
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:49,240
the snuffs that there are two or three
different kinds of snuffs that are used

1229
01:06:49,241 --> 01:06:54,241
in South America that contain DMT,
the antigen anthracite snuffs and the

1230
01:06:54,611 --> 01:06:58,420
Varroa snuffs,
the antigen anthracnose knifes are

1231
01:06:58,510 --> 01:06:59,200
ancient.

1232
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:03,910
We have archeological evidence that puts
that back to 10,

1233
01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:09,030
11,000 years.
They are by far the most ancient

1234
01:07:10,511 --> 01:07:14,530
psychedelics used in the new world or
these snuffs that contain dmt.

1235
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:19,060
Nobody is asking the question,
what possessed these people to take the

1236
01:07:19,061 --> 01:07:21,820
seeds,
grind them up and shove them up their

1237
01:07:21,821 --> 01:07:22,810
nose.
I mean,

1238
01:07:22,811 --> 01:07:27,700
this is not something that intuitively
you would do,

1239
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:33,570
and yet that seems to me as easily as
puzzling is how did they find the

1240
01:07:33,581 --> 01:07:37,120
combination for Iowa Ska?
Nobody's really addressed that.

1241
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:40,870
My first impulse when I meet,
when I find a new plant is not

1242
01:07:40,871 --> 01:07:44,110
necessarily to snort it.
It isn't that the place of the

1243
01:07:44,111 --> 01:07:47,380
pharmacological daredevil.
I mean there's always this one person

1244
01:07:47,381 --> 01:07:48,550
who's out there,
dude,

1245
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,570
Jack,
what I found,

1246
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:50,850
you know,
and that,

1247
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,190
that curiosity that need to explore
things.

1248
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:55,630
Yeah,
that's exactly right.

1249
01:07:55,660 --> 01:08:00,630
Somebody stumbled on this and I think
the same is true of Iowaska.

1250
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:03,610
You know,
because the fact dmt is not that

1251
01:08:03,611 --> 01:08:07,960
uncommon truth to tell made a carbon
liens are not that uncommon.

1252
01:08:07,961 --> 01:08:12,010
So sooner or later people are going to
stumble on this combination.

1253
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:14,710
Once they did,
then you know,

1254
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:17,630
they share with them knowledge.
It just took time.

1255
01:08:17,670 --> 01:08:19,000
Yeah,
it takes time.

1256
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:20,420
Well,
do you think there's.

1257
01:08:20,450 --> 01:08:22,760
It is possible,
I mean obviously it's possible,

1258
01:08:22,761 --> 01:08:27,761
but is there any evidence that points to
the idea that primitive primates maybe

1259
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:34,900
didn't have this monoamine oxidase and
their system and that or if they did,

1260
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:39,380
they had it in lower amounts and it
allowed more dimethyltryptamine to enter

1261
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:41,890
into the body from consuming plants.
Like is,

1262
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:46,760
is there a potential link between
consuming various plants?

1263
01:08:46,761 --> 01:08:48,050
Like we're talking about thousands of
different.

1264
01:08:48,051 --> 01:08:50,720
Like you could eat a salad if you didn't
have model amy and oxidase and you've

1265
01:08:50,721 --> 01:08:52,550
got,
you can eat a salad and potentially

1266
01:08:52,551 --> 01:08:53,120
trip.

1267
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:56,200
Yes.
If you didn't have it right is right and

1268
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:59,210
when,
when you see Jaguars that do trip,

1269
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:01,700
like there's,
there's all this footage of Jaguars in

1270
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:05,480
the jungle eating these plants,
what are they doing?

1271
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:09,080
Well,
do we know or we don't know what.

1272
01:09:09,081 --> 01:09:12,380
I'm not sure how much I,
how much credence I put into that

1273
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:14,600
footage,
but it could be like catnip,

1274
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:16,740
like maybe looks like happening,
you know,

1275
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:19,850
but they're eating Bev stereopsis
apparently,

1276
01:09:19,851 --> 01:09:23,500
which doesn't have dmt.
It's got the Beta carbon blades but,

1277
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:27,560
but harming alone contained some
psychoactive compounds.

1278
01:09:27,561 --> 01:09:28,550
Yeah,
absolutely.

1279
01:09:28,610 --> 01:09:33,200
And there are three main Beta car
bylines in baptistery stereopsis.

1280
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,360
In fact,
this is what I'm talking about,

1281
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:40,450
half the conference.
My talk is about Beta carbon cleans a

1282
01:09:41,091 --> 01:09:44,240
lot of activity.
The idea that they're not psychoactive,

1283
01:09:44,241 --> 01:09:47,840
that they're just Mao inhibitors is not
really true.

1284
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:51,510
It's an incomplete picture.
There are a,

1285
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:54,780
a lot of other activities with Beta
carbon,

1286
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:59,060
so a lot of attention recently refocused
on harming,

1287
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:02,120
which is the main Beta Carmelina and
three opsis.

1288
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:07,150
Turns out it has all kinds of activities
that have been sort of overlooked and

1289
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:12,280
now not least of all,
it stimulates a neurogenesis.

1290
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:17,380
It stimulates a nerve cell growth.
This is big news because it's huge.

1291
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,890
Yeah.
And potentially it,

1292
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:25,700
it inhibits a,
a,

1293
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:30,470
a kinase which has to do with the
kinases approach,

1294
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:33,080
a protein that phosphorolates things,
right?

1295
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:37,370
Very common.
All kinds of kinases around the body,

1296
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:42,880
but it inhibits this one particular
kinase called our k one,

1297
01:10:43,190 --> 01:10:47,630
whatever that means,
but it is associated with the,

1298
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:52,100
uh,
with the stimulation of a nerve growth

1299
01:10:52,101 --> 01:10:56,600
from neural stem cells.
This is all petri plate test tube stuff,

1300
01:10:57,230 --> 01:11:00,980
but it's not unreasonable to think that
this is going on in the bud.

1301
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:05,480
So if that plays a part in neurogenesis
that could potentially have some real

1302
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:09,890
benefits to people that have things like
Parkinson's or nerve disorders or

1303
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:15,040
exactly maybe ptsd or a cte rather it,
it could add or you know,

1304
01:11:17,131 --> 01:11:22,131
especially dementia's like fog and
cognitive Alzheimer's or other types of

1305
01:11:23,671 --> 01:11:28,200
dementia that are not strictly
Alzheimer's that are just kind of senile

1306
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:29,034
dementia.
Dementias.

1307
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:32,700
Um,
well I hope it's true because this is

1308
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:33,850
going to kick you right back.

1309
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:38,910
This is my main prophylactic.
You get civility.

1310
01:11:38,911 --> 01:11:43,380
I figured if I take Iowasca regularly,
probably going to be okay.

1311
01:11:43,381 --> 01:11:44,970
Yeah,
right back in the game.

1312
01:11:44,971 --> 01:11:49,971
Imagine if that's the case.
What one of the talks that I listened to

1313
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:52,890
have your brothers from way back in the
day.

1314
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:57,840
He was talking about a scientific
nomenclature related to harming and that

1315
01:11:57,841 --> 01:11:59,120
before they,
uh,

1316
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:04,230
one of the recent or one of the early
explorers to South America when they

1317
01:12:04,231 --> 01:12:06,710
found this stuff,
they were calling it telepathy.

1318
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:09,860
Yes.
They were calling it telepathy because

1319
01:12:09,861 --> 01:12:14,760
it induced these groups,
states of telepathy because rumor,

1320
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:15,600
rumor,
deuce.

1321
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,181
Oh,
okay.

1322
01:12:16,181 --> 01:12:18,330
Yeah,
I mean if you want to get into the,

1323
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:22,470
you know,
what you could call the sordid history

1324
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:27,471
of the chemistry investigations of
Iowaska because harming and harm ilene

1325
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:31,200
and Tetra,
hydro,

1326
01:12:31,201 --> 01:12:33,500
heart and Liza were originally found in
[inaudible],

1327
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:37,730
which is where they got their names,
which is Siri unruh.

1328
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:40,730
Right.
And a lot of people use that as an

1329
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:44,400
alternative mal when they are making it
Iowasca analogues.

1330
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:49,940
So that's how those alkaloids got their
names and then when chemists came along,

1331
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:55,620
kind of all through the 19th century,
they started looking at banisteriopsis

1332
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:59,190
and they would isolate things and they
didn't know what to call them.

1333
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:03,060
Sometimes they call them to let the
theme because of the rumors.

1334
01:13:03,061 --> 01:13:07,330
Sometimes they were called a bet,
listerine and uh,

1335
01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:10,170
uh,
a hi iin and because they didn't really

1336
01:13:10,171 --> 01:13:12,150
know what the compound was,
right?

1337
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:14,340
And then it turned out,
well,

1338
01:13:14,341 --> 01:13:18,000
it's actually harming anyone.
Harming was isolated earlier.

1339
01:13:18,001 --> 01:13:20,460
So then they got their nomenclature
right.

1340
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:25,650
There was a long period where they'd
never collected voucher specimens.

1341
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:30,360
So a lot of this work was in some ways
useless because they forgot to collect

1342
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:33,840
the actual plants that they did to
isolation from.

1343
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:37,560
It got a little more rigorous.
There was a group,

1344
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:42,680
a couple of investigators that actually
thought to collect the plants that they

1345
01:13:43,231 --> 01:13:46,770
did the isolation with.
So then they could document the source.

1346
01:13:46,771 --> 01:13:47,604
Right.
I mean,

1347
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:51,300
people think this is not important,
but an ethno pharmacology.

1348
01:13:51,301 --> 01:13:53,610
It's quite important,
you know,

1349
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:56,820
for example,
for a long time,

1350
01:13:57,030 --> 01:14:00,510
just just a side thing,
you know,

1351
01:14:00,511 --> 01:14:05,511
for a long time there was a plan called
dystonia amazonic that was reputed to be

1352
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:11,530
one of the sources of these alkaloids
and one of the components used to make

1353
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:16,531
Iowasca fat got loose in the literature
and it took years to straighten this out

1354
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:22,830
because it's not true and there was no
doubt there is no voucher specimen to

1355
01:14:23,111 --> 01:14:25,810
show that this was,
you know,

1356
01:14:25,811 --> 01:14:30,811
it was not Prestoni Amazonia got so bad
that shelties actually had to publish a

1357
01:14:31,721 --> 01:14:36,721
paper that said Prestoni Amazonia
Amazonian Hallucinogen or not turns out

1358
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:40,500
not,
you know,

1359
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:45,840
so you have to be aware of bad
documentation if you're going to collect

1360
01:14:46,811 --> 01:14:48,460
plants,
know what you're collecting.

1361
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:53,260
So the chemists that might come along
and work with that can refer back to it,

1362
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:55,930
you know,
otherwise you,

1363
01:14:56,680 --> 01:15:01,680
it's just good science and chemists
don't think in terms of the Botany Bay,

1364
01:15:02,421 --> 01:15:05,890
they just have something there and
trying to isolate something from it.

1365
01:15:05,891 --> 01:15:09,190
But you've got to be what it helps to
know what the identity of it is.

1366
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:12,340
You know.
So it seems to me that that part of the

1367
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:16,470
world,
the Amazon jungle and are really a

1368
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:20,390
troubling relationship with it currently
is so it,

1369
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:21,150
it's,
it's,

1370
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:25,030
it's so analogous to the way human
beings are kind of interfacing with the

1371
01:15:25,031 --> 01:15:26,590
world.
Like that's a good way to look at it

1372
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:30,310
there because there's so many different
powerful things that they're learning

1373
01:15:30,311 --> 01:15:34,990
about this one area while people are
chopping it down left and right and

1374
01:15:34,991 --> 01:15:38,620
slashing and burning and making room for
cattle grazing and all this other crazy

1375
01:15:38,621 --> 01:15:40,090
shit that's going on down there.

1376
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:43,930
While you know there's so much to be
learned still.

1377
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:47,680
Well yeah.
And there is a Mrs. This is a good

1378
01:15:47,681 --> 01:15:49,650
illustration of,
you know,

1379
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:52,990
our sort of penny,
penny wise and pound foolish.

1380
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,310
Less about these things.
There are literally trillions of dollars

1381
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:00,910
if you just want to look at it in terms
of dollars and cents,

1382
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:05,680
which is not the best way to look at it
because after all this ecosystem,

1383
01:16:05,681 --> 01:16:08,590
as you know,
the burning of the rain forest,

1384
01:16:08,591 --> 01:16:13,591
it's about 30 percent of human global
greenhouse gas emissions.

1385
01:16:14,051 --> 01:16:17,740
If you could just stop burning down the
data for us.

1386
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,810
Thirty percent,
30 percent,

1387
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:21,400
they figure.
Wow.

1388
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:25,600
But then on the other side of economics,
and there have been assessments,

1389
01:16:25,601 --> 01:16:26,650
how,
what w,

1390
01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:29,470
w,
what use do you make of the Amazonian

1391
01:16:29,471 --> 01:16:32,320
biome to maximize its value?
Right?

1392
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:36,550
If you do cattle,
it's worth so much per hectare if you do

1393
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:38,000
a woods.

1394
01:16:38,770 --> 01:16:39,581
Well,
yeah,

1395
01:16:39,581 --> 01:16:42,160
it's a big issue.
That's the big issue.

1396
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,300
Um,
but the thing is,

1397
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:53,070
in terms of undiscovered potentially
undiscovered blockbuster drugs,

1398
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:58,980
there's probably at least a trillion
dollars worth of undiscovered drugs in

1399
01:16:59,141 --> 01:17:02,410
the Amazon,
which will of course never be discovered

1400
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,740
because we're going to wreck it and
they're already busy.

1401
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:10,760
Recommend insane amounts of species of
plants in the Amazon has 80,000 species.

1402
01:17:13,690 --> 01:17:17,510
Yeah.
I mean there's about 250,000 species of

1403
01:17:17,511 --> 01:17:21,830
plants overall,
always revising this number and they

1404
01:17:21,831 --> 01:17:26,831
always seem to revise it up.
But between 250 to 300,000 species of so

1405
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:30,340
called higher plants.
And uh,

1406
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:33,500
in the Amazon it's one of the most bio
diverse region,

1407
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:36,290
about 80,000 species.
Wow.

1408
01:17:36,291 --> 01:17:38,960
So,
and all of these,

1409
01:17:38,961 --> 01:17:42,880
less than 10 percent of this,
not even close to 10 percent of this,

1410
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:47,950
this incredible molecular and bio and
biological diversity has been looked at

1411
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:54,470
as potential sources of new medicines.

1412
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:57,260
You know,
I mean there's a whole area of folk

1413
01:17:57,261 --> 01:18:01,880
medicine and folk knowledge,
but to systematically look through these

1414
01:18:01,881 --> 01:18:06,350
species and isolate things of interest
hasn't been done.

1415
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:07,610
You know,
a very.

1416
01:18:07,611 --> 01:18:09,320
I mean,
it's been going on for years.

1417
01:18:09,321 --> 01:18:11,900
There's been a lot of work,
but it's not really touching.

1418
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:17,210
A big proportion of
pharmaceutical companies are not

1419
01:18:17,211 --> 01:18:19,130
interested in this.
You know,

1420
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:21,710
interestingly enough,
they want to

1421
01:18:23,410 --> 01:18:26,330
know their corporations and despite,
you know,

1422
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:29,750
they tell you they're finding new
medicines that will cure people and help

1423
01:18:29,751 --> 01:18:31,700
people to a certain extent.
That's true.

1424
01:18:31,701 --> 01:18:33,860
But remember,
the bottom line is profit.

1425
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:36,830
They want to own everything.
You know,

1426
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:41,860
they don't want to share intellectual
property with the savages down there

1427
01:18:43,461 --> 01:18:46,010
that are the stewards of this knowledge.
You know,

1428
01:18:46,011 --> 01:18:49,010
why should we let these people have any
part of it?

1429
01:18:49,011 --> 01:18:52,370
So they want to make everything
synthetically.

1430
01:18:52,370 --> 01:18:56,390
They want it all to come out of vats
their laboratories.

1431
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:59,600
But it's totally wrong approach because,
uh,

1432
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:04,960
the frequency of compounds that make it
from discovery to the clinic are very,

1433
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:09,770
is very low,
and when they abandoned natural products

1434
01:19:09,771 --> 01:19:14,771
about 25 years ago,
the frequency of drug discovery,

1435
01:19:14,871 --> 01:19:18,470
that pharmaceutical discovery pipeline
as they call it,

1436
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:23,890
dried up and it took a long time for
pharmaceutical industry to realize,

1437
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:28,190
you know,
essentially we threw the baby out with

1438
01:19:28,191 --> 01:19:31,700
the bathwater.
We need to go back to natural products

1439
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:35,180
because that's where you find the
molecular diversity,

1440
01:19:35,181 --> 01:19:38,750
the scaffolds done,
which we can build these drugs,

1441
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,291
right?
I mean,

1442
01:19:39,291 --> 01:19:44,240
you think of the complex molecules that
you find in nature,

1443
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:46,150
uh,
it may,

1444
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:48,740
that may not be what makes it to the
clinic,

1445
01:19:48,770 --> 01:19:51,320
right?
It may be a derivative of that or an

1446
01:19:51,321 --> 01:19:54,590
analog of that,
but it's still the plants that give you

1447
01:19:54,591 --> 01:19:56,630
the ideas for the structure.

1448
01:19:57,620 --> 01:20:02,390
If you can follow me.
It's not that you're gonna grow this

1449
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:07,570
rain forest tree in plantations,
but you can go and isolate a compound,

1450
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:12,220
determine the structure,
and then you can probably synthesize and

1451
01:20:12,221 --> 01:20:14,850
the analog.
But the idea comes from nature.

1452
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,720
And this isn't part of the problem in
that isolating one individual compound

1453
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:23,040
from a plant that might have multiple
compounds that work synergistically.

1454
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:24,900
Well,
that's another difference,

1455
01:20:24,901 --> 01:20:25,730
right?
Right.

1456
01:20:25,730 --> 01:20:26,880
I guess the,
uh,

1457
01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:31,260
the FDA and just the whole drug
discovery process,

1458
01:20:31,261 --> 01:20:35,280
they like single compounds,
magic bullets.

1459
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:40,330
They like the synthetic compounds that
is completely define molecularly and we

1460
01:20:41,941 --> 01:20:44,130
don't,
they don't like these all these other

1461
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:47,340
related compounds like Marinol for
instance,

1462
01:20:47,341 --> 01:20:48,690
right?
Synthetic thc,

1463
01:20:48,691 --> 01:20:53,691
which is not nearly as pleasant for
people who have cancer or glaucoma or

1464
01:20:54,271 --> 01:20:57,180
any host of very good,
very good example.

1465
01:20:57,181 --> 01:20:59,610
Maryknoll,
it does what it does,

1466
01:20:59,611 --> 01:21:04,170
but the multicomponent preparations of
cannabis are much more effective.

1467
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:09,290
That's true of almost all herbal
medicine now when they isolate thc,

1468
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,030
um,
it's one of how many different

1469
01:21:12,031 --> 01:21:12,940
cannabinoids.
There's,

1470
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:18,330
I think there's about 400 different
kinds of cannabinoids in cannabis.

1471
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:23,490
So when you're getting THC,
you're getting one for

1472
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,810
$400.
Lot of other things in cannabis as well.

1473
01:21:27,811 --> 01:21:31,740
But I believe,
I remember reading there were about 400

1474
01:21:31,741 --> 01:21:35,280
kinds of chemicals and cannabis.
So good example.

1475
01:21:35,281 --> 01:21:39,690
Incredibly complex plant chemically,
you know,

1476
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:41,820
and as they all are.
But that's,

1477
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:44,670
that's a good example.
I've never taken Marinol,

1478
01:21:44,671 --> 01:21:49,080
but everyone that I know that has said
it's just a pale imitation of what

1479
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:50,850
cannabis gives you.
Yeah.

1480
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:55,970
Well if it's for one particular for one
particular use,

1481
01:21:57,691 --> 01:22:00,050
which is what the.
I guess it's pain,

1482
01:22:00,070 --> 01:22:01,740
right?
Is that what it's used for?

1483
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:04,950
But even then the people that take it
for that,

1484
01:22:04,951 --> 01:22:07,410
I've said that it's not nearly as
effective as just.

1485
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:12,850
This is a good example of the sort of
cognitive dissonance of,

1486
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:17,960
of the FDA and the whole regulatory
thing because for years the FDA has been

1487
01:22:18,301 --> 01:22:18,901
saying,
well,

1488
01:22:18,901 --> 01:22:23,100
cannabis has no medical use.
There's no recognize medical use.

1489
01:22:23,490 --> 01:22:26,370
Oh,
but there is this one drug that the FDA

1490
01:22:26,371 --> 01:22:31,320
has approved Marinol,
which has some small amount of the

1491
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:35,460
therapeutic use of cannabis does,
but it's just so incredible with so much

1492
01:22:35,461 --> 01:22:38,940
information available today that they're
making such poor choices in that regard

1493
01:22:38,941 --> 01:22:43,320
that someone can't step up and logically
address this thing and say,

1494
01:22:43,321 --> 01:22:43,790
look,
we're.

1495
01:22:43,790 --> 01:22:47,730
You're getting a fraction of the
benefits of this just because of this

1496
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:50,970
bizarre need that human beings have to
patent things,

1497
01:22:51,150 --> 01:22:52,460
to own things.
Right.

1498
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:55,260
And it's not,
the plants can't be patented and they

1499
01:22:55,261 --> 01:22:57,390
can be formulations.
Cam,

1500
01:22:57,930 --> 01:22:59,100
uh,
I think,

1501
01:22:59,101 --> 01:23:00,530
uh,
uh,

1502
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:05,660
gw pharmaceuticals which has brought up
sativas sits standardized a cannabis

1503
01:23:08,861 --> 01:23:12,280
preparation that you take orally as a
mouth spray.

1504
01:23:12,850 --> 01:23:15,610
So it's a natural product.
It's patented,

1505
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:19,390
it has all the cannabinoids are well
characterized.

1506
01:23:19,391 --> 01:23:24,391
It's essentially a standardized extract.
So that sort of represents where this is

1507
01:23:25,361 --> 01:23:27,160
going.
Well that's a positive.

1508
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:28,960
That's a positive branch of it.
Right?

1509
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:32,620
That's a good thing.
That more reflects what cannibus should

1510
01:23:32,621 --> 01:23:35,320
be as a medicine.
And so it's essentially all the

1511
01:23:35,321 --> 01:23:38,920
properties of cannabis and what they've
patented is the formulization,

1512
01:23:38,921 --> 01:23:40,990
is that what it is?
They've had that the formulation?

1513
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:43,240
Yeah.
And probably the use as well.

1514
01:23:43,241 --> 01:23:46,420
That's another way you can get patents.
So how is that formulation?

1515
01:23:46,421 --> 01:23:49,690
You need to know that.
I couldn't tell you.

1516
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:54,750
It's just,
it's an oral aerosol sprays.

1517
01:23:55,181 --> 01:23:58,950
So there's issues that come up with.
Is that it?

1518
01:23:59,050 --> 01:24:02,230
That's a company called jumbo.
Makes us spray.

1519
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:03,940
Okay.
Yeah,

1520
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:05,350
it's awesome.
Yeah,

1521
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,750
it's similar.
It's similar to that.

1522
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:09,740
It's a,
yeah,

1523
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:14,560
it's an oral,
it's an oral aerosol and insurance.

1524
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:17,050
Well,
well standardized in terms of what

1525
01:24:17,051 --> 01:24:21,010
cannabis cannabinoids are in there,
I think they brought it out initially

1526
01:24:21,011 --> 01:24:26,011
for a
multiple sclerosis that was the

1527
01:24:26,110 --> 01:24:30,370
treatment and then for seizures and
they're gradually expanding,

1528
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:31,590
you know,
I mean,

1529
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:35,890
it's interesting how marijuana has gone
from,

1530
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:38,950
you know,
this sort of reviled drug of abuse to

1531
01:24:38,951 --> 01:24:41,860
now it's the medicine of the future.

1532
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:45,160
That's a good thing.
I mean,

1533
01:24:45,161 --> 01:24:46,280
I think,
I think that,

1534
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:48,070
uh,
I think it does have a lot of

1535
01:24:48,071 --> 01:24:51,070
applications and why it should be
illegal.

1536
01:24:51,071 --> 01:24:54,520
There's no reason for this,
you know,

1537
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:58,600
but obviously there is,
it's in someone's interest to keep it

1538
01:24:58,601 --> 01:25:00,850
illegal,
but that would be my only concern with

1539
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:06,780
this patented formula formula that
they've sort of figured out is that

1540
01:25:07,901 --> 01:25:12,640
other people can't make a formula as
well as like in patenting.

1541
01:25:12,670 --> 01:25:15,040
Do they own the process?
Like what if it's a very obvious

1542
01:25:15,041 --> 01:25:15,874
process,
like,

1543
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:18,580
you know,
like the IOWASCA process.

1544
01:25:18,910 --> 01:25:23,080
It's a very obvious process.
The monoamine oxidase inhibitor along

1545
01:25:23,081 --> 01:25:25,540
with the plant that contains dmt boiled
down,

1546
01:25:25,541 --> 01:25:28,180
everybody knows how to do it.
If somebody figures out a way how to

1547
01:25:28,181 --> 01:25:29,350
patent that,
does that,

1548
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:33,430
does that become a real problem?
And that they own the rights to

1549
01:25:33,431 --> 01:25:35,080
something that's been around forever?

1550
01:25:35,110 --> 01:25:37,840
It does,
it does become a problem.

1551
01:25:37,990 --> 01:25:38,950
And,
uh,

1552
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:42,250
I'm with,
as you say,

1553
01:25:42,251 --> 01:25:45,330
with something like that where,
you know,

1554
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:49,000
it's pretty obvious how you do it.
It's not that complicated.

1555
01:25:49,001 --> 01:25:52,060
There's no innovative technology there.
There's no,

1556
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:55,600
there's no art.
There's no art of innovation,

1557
01:25:55,601 --> 01:26:00,601
which is what would make it patentable.
There were attempts to patent Iowasca a

1558
01:26:01,270 --> 01:26:03,860
few years ago and it got to,
you know,

1559
01:26:03,870 --> 01:26:08,870
what actually it was patented and a
delegation of indigenous healers from

1560
01:26:09,771 --> 01:26:10,820
Ecuador,
Colombia,

1561
01:26:10,821 --> 01:26:15,821
and Peru came to the US patent office
and petitioned against this and said,

1562
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:20,120
we've been using this medicine for
thousands of years.

1563
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:21,850
How is it that,
oh,

1564
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:26,240
it was a guy named Lauren Miller who
really didn't know what he was doing.

1565
01:26:26,570 --> 01:26:30,290
I forget what his company was.
This was when I was still doing my

1566
01:26:30,291 --> 01:26:34,310
postdoc at Nih.
So this was like mid eighties.

1567
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:38,960
He tried to patent that.
Then what it turned out was it was a

1568
01:26:38,961 --> 01:26:41,180
completely specious patent.

1569
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:46,800
Uh,
it was a patent on a particular strain

1570
01:26:46,881 --> 01:26:51,440
of banisteriopsis that he collected that
had an anomalous flower color,

1571
01:26:51,441 --> 01:26:54,710
I think.
And that was the basis of the patent

1572
01:26:54,711 --> 01:26:57,800
will.
That's absurd because flower color is

1573
01:26:58,010 --> 01:26:59,990
highly variable.
It was,

1574
01:27:00,290 --> 01:27:04,070
it was a useless patent in every
respect.

1575
01:27:04,430 --> 01:27:08,540
So yeah,
the Patent Ofa Office overturn the

1576
01:27:08,541 --> 01:27:13,541
patent as they well should have.
And then I believe it was reinstated for

1577
01:27:14,571 --> 01:27:16,880
some reason.
I haven't really followed this up,

1578
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:22,480
but I think by that time everyone kind
of came to the conclusion that it was,

1579
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:26,720
it was absurd.
There was no reason to do it and he

1580
01:27:26,721 --> 01:27:29,420
didn't really have the resources to
develop it.

1581
01:27:29,421 --> 01:27:31,510
So.
And he was not a,

1582
01:27:31,511 --> 01:27:34,490
you know,
he lost a lot of respect because it's

1583
01:27:34,491 --> 01:27:39,491
not so much that you can't,
I mean the intellectual property thing

1584
01:27:39,801 --> 01:27:41,450
is the real issue,
you know,

1585
01:27:41,451 --> 01:27:43,640
if you.
And that's why the pharmaceutical

1586
01:27:43,641 --> 01:27:48,290
companies want to stay away from
traditional medicines by and large

1587
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:51,240
because it's like,
you know,

1588
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:54,410
the enthesis people are,
that are the stewards of the knowledge.

1589
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:57,290
They know how to use the plant.
They maintain the plant,

1590
01:27:57,410 --> 01:27:59,600
their habitat,
you know,

1591
01:27:59,601 --> 01:28:04,601
it's where the plant is found.
I'm so they rightly should have a place

1592
01:28:06,771 --> 01:28:08,030
at the table,
you know,

1593
01:28:08,031 --> 01:28:11,240
if you're going to commercialize this
traditional medicine,

1594
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:15,860
they should get something back isn't
traditionally we've been ripping things

1595
01:28:15,861 --> 01:28:19,700
off from indigenous people for a long
time.

1596
01:28:19,701 --> 01:28:21,800
It's called bio piracy.
Right.

1597
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:26,830
And that's how they operate generally.
So that's an issue,

1598
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:30,440
but there are ways to address that.
Just basically,

1599
01:28:31,610 --> 01:28:34,180
you know,
come to terms with it and acknowledge

1600
01:28:34,190 --> 01:28:39,190
that their knowledge does count for
something and they should have,

1601
01:28:39,530 --> 01:28:42,260
they should have a part of the,
of the proceeds.

1602
01:28:42,261 --> 01:28:45,980
If you build a map,
if you make a billion dollar drug out of

1603
01:28:45,981 --> 01:28:47,810
this,
you should be able to give something

1604
01:28:47,811 --> 01:28:50,870
back to indigenous people.
You know.

1605
01:28:50,930 --> 01:28:54,560
So it's complicated.
It does seem complicated.

1606
01:28:54,561 --> 01:28:58,520
It also seems like when you,
when everything becomes commercial,

1607
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:02,130
it becomes,
is it like when you look at the idea

1608
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:04,110
that pharmaceutical drug companies at
all,

1609
01:29:04,530 --> 01:29:09,530
when you look at a corporation and you
think of this idea of infinite growth

1610
01:29:09,631 --> 01:29:12,240
and this is what they're subscribing to
and the constant trying to make more and

1611
01:29:12,241 --> 01:29:17,130
more money and then you,
you think about compounds and compounds

1612
01:29:17,131 --> 01:29:21,270
being legal and them trying to figure
out a way to market these things.

1613
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:25,380
It seems to become.
It seems to be a big issue that we're

1614
01:29:25,381 --> 01:29:28,590
relying on that at all.
It's almost like the tail of the

1615
01:29:28,591 --> 01:29:31,380
Scorpion and the frog.
The Frog says,

1616
01:29:31,410 --> 01:29:32,760
tells the Scorpion,
Hey,

1617
01:29:32,761 --> 01:29:36,480
I'll give you a ride across the river,
but do me a favor and don't sting me

1618
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:39,690
because you deal with both drowned and
then halfway through the Scorpion

1619
01:29:39,691 --> 01:29:40,710
stings,
the frog goes,

1620
01:29:40,711 --> 01:29:41,970
what the fuck?
And the Scorpion goes,

1621
01:29:41,971 --> 01:29:43,020
hey man,
it's my nature.

1622
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:48,690
It seems like the nature of these
corporations is just to make money.

1623
01:29:48,690 --> 01:29:53,690
So relying on them to bring these
intense psychedelic compounds to the

1624
01:29:54,241 --> 01:29:57,660
market or to even saying the market's
terrible word,

1625
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:01,340
to just bring them to daily use or bring
them to the.

1626
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:06,720
Making them free to use.
I think the corporations,

1627
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:08,850
you know,
as you say,

1628
01:30:08,851 --> 01:30:12,660
their main job as they,
as they see it though,

1629
01:30:12,661 --> 01:30:16,080
they don't say so in public is basically
they'll make money,

1630
01:30:16,081 --> 01:30:18,590
you know,
to patent these compounds and making

1631
01:30:18,591 --> 01:30:22,200
money and make more money every year.
And the best way to know there's no

1632
01:30:22,201 --> 01:30:24,240
revenue model,
psychedelics,

1633
01:30:24,241 --> 01:30:29,220
there's no way for them to make money
according to that mall is a way to not

1634
01:30:29,221 --> 01:30:31,140
make money.
Don't give that guy who's got a leaf

1635
01:30:31,141 --> 01:30:32,640
over his dick,
a billion dollars,

1636
01:30:33,260 --> 01:30:35,520
that guy,
he's been happy shooting arrows at

1637
01:30:35,521 --> 01:30:37,820
monkeys for 10,000 years.
That's kind of.

1638
01:30:38,380 --> 01:30:40,250
Yeah,
it's just not.

1639
01:30:40,251 --> 01:30:42,330
So they're not going to do that if they
don't have to.

1640
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:45,450
Well they won't.
And you know,

1641
01:30:45,451 --> 01:30:49,200
these are,
they want these psychedelics if you use

1642
01:30:49,201 --> 01:30:52,950
them therapeutically,
these are things you might take a few

1643
01:30:52,951 --> 01:30:56,550
times in your life.
They want drugs you take four times a

1644
01:30:56,551 --> 01:31:00,780
day for the rest of your life.
That's the revenue model and the revenue

1645
01:31:00,781 --> 01:31:03,850
model,
if there is one with psychedelics is not

1646
01:31:03,870 --> 01:31:07,770
that because they have to be used in a
context,

1647
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:09,750
you know,
set and setting,

1648
01:31:09,751 --> 01:31:11,610
right.
The revenue model,

1649
01:31:11,611 --> 01:31:15,120
if there is one,
is to have centers to have places you

1650
01:31:15,121 --> 01:31:18,780
can go and take psychedelics in a
controlled setting.

1651
01:31:19,410 --> 01:31:22,160
They won't look like clinics.
They'll look like spa was,

1652
01:31:22,450 --> 01:31:23,283
you know,
I mean,

1653
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:26,910
take the family for a weekend and have a
nice,

1654
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:30,810
you know,
silicide when vacation while you're busy

1655
01:31:30,811 --> 01:31:33,600
getting your massages and doing yoga and
whatever.

1656
01:31:33,601 --> 01:31:38,601
That's how it's gonna work if it,
if it's allowed to go forward.

1657
01:31:39,950 --> 01:31:42,270
That's the model.
Uh,

1658
01:31:44,130 --> 01:31:44,941
yeah.
Well,

1659
01:31:44,941 --> 01:31:46,080
we'll see.
I mean,

1660
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:52,340
I've often said the very idea that you
could patent or prohibit a plant is

1661
01:31:57,390 --> 01:31:58,890
absurd.
It is absurd.

1662
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:00,850
Especially one that's nontoxic.

1663
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:04,620
What is not patented is prohibited.
That's,

1664
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:07,870
that's,
that's the way they approach in most

1665
01:32:07,871 --> 01:32:10,060
circumstances,
which were real weird,

1666
01:32:10,061 --> 01:32:13,780
is that we give these caveats to
religions.

1667
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:18,700
Like that's what's going on now with
Iowasca is that there are some companies

1668
01:32:18,701 --> 01:32:22,150
that have had an exemption through the
supreme court.

1669
01:32:22,151 --> 01:32:23,770
Right?
I shouldn't say companies,

1670
01:32:23,771 --> 01:32:25,570
but it basically that's what they are.
There are churches,

1671
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:29,230
there are churches,
which is really just another way of

1672
01:32:29,231 --> 01:32:33,970
saying a company out there to their
institution.

1673
01:32:34,870 --> 01:32:38,650
So the question is,
and now people are beginning to sort of

1674
01:32:38,770 --> 01:32:40,960
recognize this or,
or ask the question,

1675
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:43,600
so you've got your,
you've got the UDP,

1676
01:32:43,690 --> 01:32:48,690
which is one of these churches that's.
They're the ones that took their case

1677
01:32:49,331 --> 01:32:54,331
all the way to the Supreme Court and got
approved unanimously under actually the

1678
01:32:55,001 --> 01:32:59,980
first case that John Roberts decided
after he became chief justice.

1679
01:32:59,981 --> 01:33:04,981
So very conservative court that
unanimously ruled that yes,

1680
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:08,260
the udv is a real religion,
which is fascinating.

1681
01:33:08,290 --> 01:33:11,290
They have the right to use it well.
It clearly is a real religion.

1682
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:13,810
It is a real religious.
Just fascinating that a conservative

1683
01:33:13,811 --> 01:33:16,690
court would have,
would almost be boxed into doing that

1684
01:33:16,691 --> 01:33:19,060
because of their views on Christianity.
Exactly,

1685
01:33:19,150 --> 01:33:21,190
exactly.
They couldn't not do it.

1686
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:26,080
And then the central dimey same thing.
They didn't have to go all the way,

1687
01:33:26,081 --> 01:33:30,160
but essentially they have the same
approval and they're piggybacking on

1688
01:33:30,161 --> 01:33:33,040
this and it's their Christian based
religions as well.

1689
01:33:33,090 --> 01:33:35,170
Yeah,
well they're Christian race religion.

1690
01:33:35,171 --> 01:33:38,020
So now the question is when you go to
Peru,

1691
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:40,420
there's Iowasca.
It's used.

1692
01:33:40,660 --> 01:33:45,660
It's not as institutionalized.
It's kind of idiosyncratic.

1693
01:33:46,271 --> 01:33:48,430
You know,
you've got these practitioners that the

1694
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:52,840
traditionals called vegetal small.
There's no institution,

1695
01:33:52,841 --> 01:33:54,940
there's no.
There's no doctrine.

1696
01:33:54,941 --> 01:33:57,250
There's no hierarchy.
There's no.

1697
01:33:57,310 --> 01:34:01,900
There's just freelance practitioners.
Question is,

1698
01:34:02,020 --> 01:34:07,020
is that a religious activity and should
it be protected and this is what some

1699
01:34:07,690 --> 01:34:12,690
smart lawyers are now addressing with
the use of Iowaska in the more

1700
01:34:12,881 --> 01:34:14,020
traditional way.

1701
01:34:14,660 --> 01:34:19,660
I tend to have essentially taken that
they've appropriated that tradition and

1702
01:34:19,811 --> 01:34:20,291
they say,
well,

1703
01:34:20,291 --> 01:34:22,660
we want nothing to do with these digitas
people.

1704
01:34:22,980 --> 01:34:24,970
Sorry.
This is our religion.

1705
01:34:25,090 --> 01:34:26,620
You know,
it's our sacrament.

1706
01:34:26,830 --> 01:34:31,240
They don't even.
They get upset if you even call it a

1707
01:34:31,241 --> 01:34:33,730
drug or a medicine.
To them it's a sacrament.

1708
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:37,750
That's fine,
but elsewhere it isn't medicine,

1709
01:34:38,620 --> 01:34:40,970
but it is also a,
you know,

1710
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:46,020
a religious activity of visually smell
has a spiritual aspect.

1711
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:50,230
It should be regarded as a religion.
We'll see where that goes.

1712
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:54,430
It's almost like with the UDV and these
other churches that what they've done is

1713
01:34:54,431 --> 01:34:58,370
they've used this scaffolding of
Christianity as a Trojan horse

1714
01:34:58,910 --> 01:35:01,610
that's allowing this Iowasca to get
through.

1715
01:35:02,870 --> 01:35:05,270
Strassman was telling me his experience
with it,

1716
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:10,750
with them where they were all wearing
golf shirts and they have uniforms and

1717
01:35:11,260 --> 01:35:16,260
they're taking these insane doses of
super potent Iowasca and you know,

1718
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:22,240
and then they're all singing and singing
songs about Jesus and strassman has like

1719
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:27,890
a really like very mellow and easygoing
guy.

1720
01:35:27,891 --> 01:35:30,950
Really pleasant guy.
He was explaining how he sat down with

1721
01:35:30,951 --> 01:35:32,750
these people in the morning after all
this is over.

1722
01:35:32,751 --> 01:35:34,520
It's like,
what the fuck are you people doing?

1723
01:35:36,050 --> 01:35:39,200
Browser raised and he's taking about his
trip from the night before.

1724
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:41,630
He's like,
these people are taking like super

1725
01:35:41,631 --> 01:35:46,160
potent doses of IOWASCA and they're
singing about Jesus with golf shirts on.

1726
01:35:46,161 --> 01:35:47,630
It's like what the F,
you know,

1727
01:35:47,631 --> 01:35:51,890
they have like plastic folding chairs
and shit and like on furniture and it's

1728
01:35:51,891 --> 01:35:53,270
like,
what the fuck is this?

1729
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:57,830
What it is is it's a religion.
It's a religion,

1730
01:35:57,831 --> 01:35:59,300
that's what it is,
you know?

1731
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:02,360
Um,
but I think it's okay.

1732
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:05,720
Read it away,
spread it and spread it on.

1733
01:36:05,721 --> 01:36:06,680
I mean,
the thing is I,

1734
01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:09,860
I worked,
I haven't had much to do with central

1735
01:36:09,861 --> 01:36:12,710
Thai May.
Not that I just haven't had the

1736
01:36:12,711 --> 01:36:16,910
opportunity nor am I particularly
interested in going to ceremonies where

1737
01:36:16,911 --> 01:36:19,990
I am told that I have to dance the
whole.

1738
01:36:20,490 --> 01:36:23,690
Not My thing,
but I know the UDP well,

1739
01:36:24,210 --> 01:36:26,840
you know,
because we did the biomedical study with

1740
01:36:26,841 --> 01:36:29,690
them and the nineties.
So they're wonderful people.

1741
01:36:29,691 --> 01:36:32,270
They're very kind,
you know,

1742
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:35,600
their families are good.
They're very nice people.

1743
01:36:35,630 --> 01:36:38,070
But I would never join.
They asked me to join.

1744
01:36:38,090 --> 01:36:38,780
I said,
look,

1745
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:42,830
I don't do cults.
I'd be happy to come drink with you

1746
01:36:42,831 --> 01:36:47,690
anytime that religion or the Groucho
Marx one said,

1747
01:36:47,691 --> 01:36:50,840
I think to paraphrase him,
I would never be a member of any group

1748
01:36:50,841 --> 01:36:51,674
that would have me.

1749
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:54,320
Yeah,
that's pretty much what I told them.

1750
01:36:54,321 --> 01:36:57,920
You know,
you don't want me heritage by nature,

1751
01:36:57,921 --> 01:37:02,921
but I'm happy to share your brew and
they do make fine brood.

1752
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:07,070
No.
Does your organization tweeted out for

1753
01:37:07,071 --> 01:37:08,300
you?
But I'm not showing up at the

1754
01:37:08,330 --> 01:37:10,610
stockholders meeting.
I'm not good at joy,

1755
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:15,880
but it seems to me with my experience
with dmt that it's so powerful and so

1756
01:37:16,071 --> 01:37:19,550
profound that I wonder if that's a way
that Christianity works.

1757
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:22,550
You know,
like this idea of Jesus and the saints

1758
01:37:22,551 --> 01:37:26,150
in Heaven and God and all these
different manifested deities,

1759
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:31,280
like people thumb their nose at it and
say it's ridiculous and preposterous,

1760
01:37:31,281 --> 01:37:36,281
but everything on Dmt is ridiculous and
preposterous and I wonder if under the

1761
01:37:36,471 --> 01:37:38,990
guise of the UDV and they're singing,
they're dancing,

1762
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:44,440
if Jesus is real in a sense that you can
actually communicate with a thing that

1763
01:37:44,451 --> 01:37:47,750
takes the form of Jesus.
In that sense,

1764
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:49,790
I wonder what they're seeing.
I mean,

1765
01:37:49,791 --> 01:37:54,590
I really wonder if they're going.
The whole idea of psychedelics for the

1766
01:37:54,591 --> 01:37:56,100
non initiated is a big

1767
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:59,700
part of it is how you're going into the
experience set and setting and also your

1768
01:37:59,701 --> 01:38:02,030
mindset.
Also the,

1769
01:38:02,170 --> 01:38:06,450
the state of mind that you approach
these things can greatly affect your

1770
01:38:06,451 --> 01:38:09,530
experience.
Hence bad trips for people that have an

1771
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:12,780
unstable psychological state of mind or
they try to fight the experience.

1772
01:38:13,110 --> 01:38:16,200
I really wonder if these people are
embracing the,

1773
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:18,210
all the beautiful concepts of
Christianity,

1774
01:38:18,211 --> 01:38:19,330
the love,
the,

1775
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:22,440
the,
the family idea,

1776
01:38:22,441 --> 01:38:24,090
that blood brotherhood,
the,

1777
01:38:24,450 --> 01:38:29,400
the idea of brothers and sisters
together in this sense of unity and love

1778
01:38:29,401 --> 01:38:33,180
of the creator.
If this under this idea,

1779
01:38:33,210 --> 01:38:36,900
if Christianity is actually an effective
approach.

1780
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:38,040
Well,
I think,

1781
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:40,920
I think what your experience,
you know,

1782
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:45,540
it is not confined to Christianity.
What you articulated is just basically

1783
01:38:45,870 --> 01:38:50,870
kind of the characteristics of a
religious experience or spiritual

1784
01:38:51,991 --> 01:38:55,830
experience without necessarily tying it
to Christianity.

1785
01:38:55,831 --> 01:38:57,690
I mean love,
compassion,

1786
01:38:57,691 --> 01:38:59,070
respect for each other.

1787
01:38:59,670 --> 01:39:00,540
You know,
I mean,

1788
01:39:00,541 --> 01:39:02,730
these are elements of a,
uh,

1789
01:39:02,740 --> 01:39:04,020
kind of the,
uh,

1790
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:06,840
well,
I don't know what you call a generic

1791
01:39:06,841 --> 01:39:09,090
religion.
These are elements of the religious

1792
01:39:09,091 --> 01:39:13,260
experience.
The interesting thing about the UDV and

1793
01:39:13,261 --> 01:39:18,261
these other churches is that they have
actually created a structure where this

1794
01:39:18,511 --> 01:39:21,960
can happen.
Whereas most religions,

1795
01:39:21,961 --> 01:39:26,490
the last thing they want you to do is
have an actual religious experience.

1796
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:28,740
I mean,
it's all made.

1797
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:33,270
It's all set up to make sure that
doesn't happen because it just

1798
01:39:33,330 --> 01:39:37,440
experiences are dangerous as a very
profound thing.

1799
01:39:37,441 --> 01:39:40,830
You just said that most religious,
the last thing they want is for you to

1800
01:39:40,831 --> 01:39:44,100
have a real religious experience,
so it's all set up to make sure that

1801
01:39:44,101 --> 01:39:47,850
doesn't happen.
Only the priests get to have it or that

1802
01:39:47,851 --> 01:39:51,240
was the original thing,
and then of course they don't have it

1803
01:39:51,241 --> 01:39:53,450
either because they're,
you know,

1804
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:58,520
I mean it's gotten a ways from that I'm
missing is that that they original idea

1805
01:40:01,201 --> 01:40:05,100
of the rules of Christianity might have
come from that.

1806
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:08,820
The Moses and the burning Bush,
these ideas that are passed on,

1807
01:40:08,821 --> 01:40:11,880
love thy neighbor,
all that stuff might have been from that

1808
01:40:11,881 --> 01:40:14,850
very experience.
Might've been from that various that

1809
01:40:14,940 --> 01:40:16,590
experience.
But the thing is,

1810
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:19,920
and this happens,
it's not just Christianity,

1811
01:40:19,921 --> 01:40:24,921
it's like it's like any powerful
spiritual technology.

1812
01:40:25,801 --> 01:40:28,080
Anything that is numinous,
right?

1813
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:31,320
I talk a lot about the mysterium
tremendum,

1814
01:40:31,321 --> 01:40:33,300
right?
The DMT,

1815
01:40:33,301 --> 01:40:35,550
the psychedelic experiences,
a mysterium,

1816
01:40:35,551 --> 01:40:39,570
tremendum,
something that is mysterious,

1817
01:40:39,660 --> 01:40:41,730
tremendous,
terrifying,

1818
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:47,010
spiritually powerful and must be
controlled,

1819
01:40:47,070 --> 01:40:47,903
right?
I mean,

1820
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:49,440
it is.
All those things.

1821
01:40:49,441 --> 01:40:51,420
It's too powerful.
So in these,

1822
01:40:51,421 --> 01:40:55,150
in these power structure,
there's always someone who says,

1823
01:40:55,540 --> 01:40:59,710
who wants to sort of put a collar around
that,

1824
01:40:59,711 --> 01:41:03,030
put a lasso around that to seize the
reins if the,

1825
01:41:03,031 --> 01:41:08,031
if you will,
there's a temptation to grab it and use

1826
01:41:08,741 --> 01:41:12,880
it for your own purposes,
which is usually a man usually.

1827
01:41:12,881 --> 01:41:15,490
I don't know if any women women don't
seem to be,

1828
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:19,990
you know,
that it's not in built to do the

1829
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:24,340
dominance thing,
but there's very often a male figure who

1830
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:28,510
can take it.
Any spiritual technology coopt at to

1831
01:41:28,511 --> 01:41:31,180
their purpose,
you know,

1832
01:41:31,570 --> 01:41:35,860
which is often sex or money or power or
all of those things.

1833
01:41:36,050 --> 01:41:36,960
Yeah.
That's always a man.

1834
01:41:36,961 --> 01:41:38,660
Now of course it's a man,
dammit.

1835
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:42,690
Why do we suck?
We just do,

1836
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:43,700
you know,
I mean,

1837
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:49,350
that's why there's 7 billion people
because we're sneaky and we get your

1838
01:41:49,351 --> 01:41:50,300
pregnant.
Okay.

1839
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:53,610
Sorry.
That's pretty much yet.

1840
01:41:53,660 --> 01:41:56,040
We're not,
we don't want to be like this ladies.

1841
01:41:56,310 --> 01:42:00,660
It's not our fault God,
but it's always a man.

1842
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:02,130
It really is always a man.
I mean,

1843
01:42:02,150 --> 01:42:03,050
there's no arguing with it,

1844
01:42:03,110 --> 01:42:05,750
you know?
So you get this all the time,

1845
01:42:05,810 --> 01:42:06,810
you know,
in,

1846
01:42:06,900 --> 01:42:11,900
in any kind of quote unquote spiritual
tradition that happens in the,

1847
01:42:12,620 --> 01:42:14,650
in the IOWASCA thing,
as we know,

1848
01:42:14,651 --> 01:42:18,290
you know,
it's not uncommon to sexual abuse

1849
01:42:18,650 --> 01:42:22,670
sort of very common lately,
lately more and more so you hear these

1850
01:42:22,671 --> 01:42:24,690
stories of these guys.
Um,

1851
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:26,720
my friend Amber Lyon,
had it had happened to her,

1852
01:42:26,721 --> 01:42:30,050
like on one of her first experiences,
Scott was groping her and where she was

1853
01:42:30,051 --> 01:42:33,260
under and she's realizing what's going
on and just realize like,

1854
01:42:33,261 --> 01:42:36,780
this is probably how some of these
people sort of like,

1855
01:42:36,830 --> 01:42:39,710
they found this technology and you can
call it technology if you want,

1856
01:42:39,711 --> 01:42:42,110
but this,
this pathway to this incredible

1857
01:42:42,111 --> 01:42:44,090
experience.
They provide it to people,

1858
01:42:44,450 --> 01:42:49,130
but they're not really much in into
taking that journey themselves really

1859
01:42:49,131 --> 01:42:54,131
into exploiting this thing for financial
gain and for power and influence.

1860
01:42:54,570 --> 01:42:59,570
That is what it's morphed into now that
there's the tourism phenomena and all

1861
01:42:59,641 --> 01:43:01,290
that stuff.
So yes,

1862
01:43:01,890 --> 01:43:03,990
they see it as a way to,
uh,

1863
01:43:04,710 --> 01:43:08,820
to exactly that,
to power influence and money,

1864
01:43:09,150 --> 01:43:11,040
which just illustrates,
again,

1865
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:15,930
it's all about,
there's nothing inherently good or bad

1866
01:43:15,931 --> 01:43:17,610
about these technologies.
There

1867
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:22,440
can be a wonderful thing if it's used
properly.

1868
01:43:22,450 --> 01:43:25,890
That can be a really terrible thing.
It's all about the use you make of it,

1869
01:43:25,950 --> 01:43:30,770
you know,
the moral dimension that comes with,

1870
01:43:31,050 --> 01:43:32,760
with how you use it,
you know,

1871
01:43:32,761 --> 01:43:36,850
I mean there are ios scarecrows that
have no,

1872
01:43:36,890 --> 01:43:38,910
I,
I say they don't listen to their

1873
01:43:38,911 --> 01:43:42,390
medicine since they,
they do these things,

1874
01:43:42,391 --> 01:43:46,920
they're not really absorbing the lessons
that they should be getting from the

1875
01:43:46,921 --> 01:43:50,640
medicine.
Others do listen to their medicine and

1876
01:43:50,650 --> 01:43:51,483
they're,
you know,

1877
01:43:51,860 --> 01:43:52,670
it's

1878
01:43:52,670 --> 01:43:56,960
not so easy to sort out who's the good
ones and who's the bad was sort of like

1879
01:43:56,961 --> 01:43:59,090
what you were talking about,
these people that have this simplistic

1880
01:43:59,091 --> 01:44:01,890
idea that all you have to do is get
Donald Trump high on dmt and he's going

1881
01:44:01,891 --> 01:44:04,460
to see the light.
That's not necessarily the case,

1882
01:44:04,461 --> 01:44:07,820
not necessarily the case.
I think it would be wasted on him.

1883
01:44:07,821 --> 01:44:12,821
I think we would have to do at least at
least an indwelling catheter,

1884
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:18,100
maybe three hours of continuous
infusion.

1885
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:23,240
Wrong,
wrong term,

1886
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:25,970
intravenous,
but it's very,

1887
01:44:27,070 --> 01:44:30,040
very freudian decided to go through his
dick.

1888
01:44:30,270 --> 01:44:31,660
Right.
That is hilarious.

1889
01:44:32,470 --> 01:44:33,490
Not that we'll.
We'll,

1890
01:44:33,910 --> 01:44:36,040
we'll go through the vein.
No,

1891
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:37,660
man.
I think he might have nailed it the

1892
01:44:37,661 --> 01:44:41,110
first time.
Might be the way to get it,

1893
01:44:41,430 --> 01:44:45,310
but maybe the way to get it to them as
some perfect Russian robot fucked off.

1894
01:44:45,870 --> 01:44:48,310
Just locks them up and you know.

1895
01:44:48,370 --> 01:44:50,760
Right when he gets inside.
There you go.

1896
01:44:50,860 --> 01:44:55,080
She gets them in full guard.
Locks them in place and catheter.

1897
01:44:55,081 --> 01:44:57,500
Like delivery.
Wow.

1898
01:44:58,580 --> 01:45:00,160
Yeah.
Maybe they can program at like,

1899
01:45:00,290 --> 01:45:03,380
like Dmt,
like little nanobots that go right

1900
01:45:03,381 --> 01:45:05,600
through the hole,
right through the penis hole,

1901
01:45:06,730 --> 01:45:09,640
right into the system.
They just run out of her right in there

1902
01:45:09,641 --> 01:45:12,600
and he's whole.
You just takes off.

1903
01:45:12,780 --> 01:45:15,090
But again,
there has to be something.

1904
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:17,670
Somebody animated that have an effect.
Please.

1905
01:45:17,671 --> 01:45:20,430
So many anime.
I know there's somebody out there that

1906
01:45:20,431 --> 01:45:25,260
wants to do it
the way to do it.

1907
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:27,600
Just some perfect,
super hot.

1908
01:45:27,630 --> 01:45:32,630
10 Russian hooker looking chick.
No offense to Russian hookers,

1909
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:36,720
right?
Or Donald Trump or Donald Trump even.

1910
01:45:36,810 --> 01:45:39,120
Look,
Donald Trump was a baby at one point in

1911
01:45:39,121 --> 01:45:39,721
time.
You know,

1912
01:45:39,721 --> 01:45:41,490
and you and I,
we both have children.

1913
01:45:41,491 --> 01:45:43,860
We know this.
It's a delicate process of turning an

1914
01:45:43,861 --> 01:45:45,040
adult,
uh,

1915
01:45:45,330 --> 01:45:46,970
making it an adult out of a child.

1916
01:45:47,020 --> 01:45:51,930
A lot of factors come into play,
but almost all babies are born well.

1917
01:45:51,931 --> 01:45:55,200
They'd certainly have their own
personality in many ways,

1918
01:45:55,201 --> 01:45:58,050
a blank slate.
And so they're in a lot of ways,

1919
01:45:58,051 --> 01:46:00,120
a victim of the environment that they're
raised in.

1920
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:05,800
And that's one of the weird things that
I've developed in my own self over the

1921
01:46:06,510 --> 01:46:08,850
last few years is just thinking about
people as babies.

1922
01:46:09,270 --> 01:46:13,080
I think if everyone has a baby now,
since I've had kids,

1923
01:46:13,470 --> 01:46:15,330
I don't,
I mean obviously I think of them as

1924
01:46:15,331 --> 01:46:17,940
being adults,
but I think of them as an adult that

1925
01:46:17,941 --> 01:46:21,090
used to be a baby.
And I never used to do that before I had

1926
01:46:21,091 --> 01:46:22,590
children.
I used to think of people as being a

1927
01:46:22,591 --> 01:46:24,000
static state.
I mean,

1928
01:46:24,001 --> 01:46:24,661
you and I go,
well,

1929
01:46:24,661 --> 01:46:27,180
this is Dennis Mckenna.
This is how Dennis Mckenna has always

1930
01:46:27,181 --> 01:46:28,260
been,
and now I go,

1931
01:46:28,261 --> 01:46:29,820
oh,
Dennis used to be a little boy,

1932
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:31,440
you know,
Dennis was a baby.

1933
01:46:31,470 --> 01:46:32,720
He used to,
you know,

1934
01:46:32,790 --> 01:46:35,540
and then he saw a lot of songs and a lot
of things,

1935
01:46:35,700 --> 01:46:36,760
but you know what I mean?
Yeah.

1936
01:46:36,890 --> 01:46:40,800
Like trump,
he's almost as much of a victim as he is

1937
01:46:40,801 --> 01:46:43,980
a perpetrator in a way.
He is.

1938
01:46:44,610 --> 01:46:48,870
Trump's a good example of somebody.
I mean in some ways he's still a child.

1939
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:49,470
Yeah,
I know.

1940
01:46:49,470 --> 01:46:50,130
He never

1941
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:53,560
really grew up.
I mean that's part of the problem and

1942
01:46:53,590 --> 01:46:56,340
everyone,
because he has so much power and money,

1943
01:46:56,341 --> 01:46:59,970
everyone kowtows to his impulses,
but you know,

1944
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:05,060
I mean somebody like jared and Ivanka or
maybe a stabilizing influence on him,

1945
01:47:05,550 --> 01:47:08,670
old or older,
even though I'm sure their agenda is

1946
01:47:08,671 --> 01:47:11,370
totally evil as well.
Confused.

1947
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:14,040
No,
they definitely don't deserve the amount

1948
01:47:14,041 --> 01:47:15,900
of power that they're wielding,
nor does anybody.

1949
01:47:15,901 --> 01:47:20,370
What's more fascinating about him than
anything is that what he holds up to the

1950
01:47:20,371 --> 01:47:22,050
golden standard is success,
right?

1951
01:47:22,290 --> 01:47:23,830
I mean this is the guy that,
you know,

1952
01:47:23,850 --> 01:47:27,000
everything has to have his name on it.
So trump this and trump that,

1953
01:47:27,001 --> 01:47:31,350
and if you looked at the great American
vision of success,

1954
01:47:31,351 --> 01:47:34,260
it's to become some sort of super rich
ultra billionaire,

1955
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:38,670
but even though everybody knows he's the
super rich ultra billionaire,

1956
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:42,690
he still is deceptive about his own
success.

1957
01:47:42,810 --> 01:47:46,770
He still has to lie about it.
He still has to distort it far past,

1958
01:47:46,980 --> 01:47:49,350
whether it's the numbers that came to
the inauguration,

1959
01:47:49,351 --> 01:47:52,020
whether it's the numbers that he won the
electoral college by.

1960
01:47:52,260 --> 01:47:54,510
He lies about all these different things
and it's an.

1961
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:56,970
It's inherent.
It's a part of him.

1962
01:47:56,971 --> 01:48:00,720
This intense lack of satisfaction with
any result,

1963
01:48:01,470 --> 01:48:04,530
any result,
even if it's winning by a mile,

1964
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:06,740
he must win by 100 miles.
Right?

1965
01:48:07,110 --> 01:48:08,880
You know,
and that's childish.

1966
01:48:09,090 --> 01:48:12,480
That's like an intense,
but it's that same intense

1967
01:48:12,481 --> 01:48:16,350
dissatisfaction that's inherently very
dangerous in a leader because it's

1968
01:48:16,351 --> 01:48:20,940
leading him to make these,
these critical judgments that aren't

1969
01:48:20,941 --> 01:48:25,680
based entirely unreality,
but rather what he wants people to

1970
01:48:25,681 --> 01:48:26,990
perceive.
Right.

1971
01:48:27,210 --> 01:48:28,560
That,
that's quite right.

1972
01:48:28,590 --> 01:48:31,470
I think that's dangerous.
That's what we were saying before,

1973
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:34,890
no thoughtfulness,
there's no thoughtfulness and the man,

1974
01:48:34,891 --> 01:48:37,890
there's no reflection,
reflection,

1975
01:48:37,891 --> 01:48:38,730
a lack of humility.

1976
01:48:38,730 --> 01:48:42,760
So this is a,
this is not what you want in your

1977
01:48:42,780 --> 01:48:45,680
leaders because we see what's happening.
Like,

1978
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:49,590
no,
he's going back and forth with the

1979
01:48:49,591 --> 01:48:54,590
Soviets is going back and forth with
North Korea and it's like a schoolyard

1980
01:48:54,610 --> 01:48:55,443
spot,
you know,

1981
01:48:55,590 --> 01:48:58,020
but these people have nuclear weapons to
throw.

1982
01:48:58,021 --> 01:49:01,080
So we need to back off from that.
Donald,

1983
01:49:01,081 --> 01:49:02,040
you know,
it's just.

1984
01:49:02,970 --> 01:49:06,030
But he can't do that because he has to
respond.

1985
01:49:06,031 --> 01:49:09,060
He has this impulse to respond.
I mean,

1986
01:49:09,061 --> 01:49:10,260
I think that,
uh,

1987
01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:12,000
you know,
I don't know.

1988
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:15,540
I mean if he's not going to be exposed
to,

1989
01:49:15,590 --> 01:49:20,590
I was pretty sure unfortunately because
it would help him and you know,

1990
01:49:21,781 --> 01:49:23,670
what,
what is disturbing to me.

1991
01:49:23,671 --> 01:49:28,671
Many things about donald and this sort
of reality distortion and has created

1992
01:49:28,861 --> 01:49:31,150
his people,
you know,

1993
01:49:31,170 --> 01:49:34,290
they take it seriously.
I mean they're sort of like intimidated

1994
01:49:34,291 --> 01:49:36,480
by it.
Not enough people are standing up and

1995
01:49:36,481 --> 01:49:38,910
saying,
well this is not true.

1996
01:49:38,911 --> 01:49:41,970
This is not true.
You're completely diluted about this

1997
01:49:41,971 --> 01:49:43,170
here.
You know,

1998
01:49:43,650 --> 01:49:48,040
I mean there's a some sort of impulse to
show some respect

1999
01:49:48,820 --> 01:49:52,270
when no respect is,
is do you know,

2000
01:49:52,860 --> 01:49:55,500
respect for the office,
for the office,

2001
01:49:55,880 --> 01:49:57,160
for whatever,
some,

2002
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:01,540
but then when he comes out with these
things that are obviously not true,

2003
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:04,930
I'm sorry,
there are no alternative facts.

2004
01:50:05,410 --> 01:50:10,410
Alternative facts are lies as our candy
coating of Bullshit alternative facts is

2005
01:50:13,241 --> 01:50:15,190
the muscle areas,
candy coating of bullshit ever.

2006
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:18,850
My,
my hope is that we get through this

2007
01:50:18,851 --> 01:50:22,090
without nuclear war and then we realized
that we can't have a fucking president

2008
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:26,290
and the idea of having one alpha champ
run the entire group of 300 plus million

2009
01:50:26,291 --> 01:50:30,670
people is insane and it doesn't work
when you have technology,

2010
01:50:30,671 --> 01:50:33,520
when you have this ability to
communicate instantaneously,

2011
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:37,630
globally with everybody constantly.
It's just,

2012
01:50:37,660 --> 01:50:42,550
it's an archaic idea that served its
time but needs to be revamped.

2013
01:50:43,270 --> 01:50:45,430
How would you do that?
That's a really good question.

2014
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:48,790
You know,
I'm not the guy to be the architect of

2015
01:50:48,791 --> 01:50:52,030
the future civilization,
but I would think that putting as much

2016
01:50:52,031 --> 01:50:56,590
power as we put into one individual is
insanely problematic.

2017
01:50:56,740 --> 01:50:59,260
It's just you.
You're dealing with all these ego

2018
01:50:59,261 --> 01:51:01,510
issues,
decision making issues,

2019
01:51:01,870 --> 01:51:04,390
and also the camps that two separate
camps,

2020
01:51:04,391 --> 01:51:06,430
the right left camp.
That's crazy too.

2021
01:51:06,610 --> 01:51:08,140
That's crazy too.
Right?

2022
01:51:08,260 --> 01:51:09,093
Right.
No,

2023
01:51:09,310 --> 01:51:14,310
I mean I think one way to approach it
wouldn't have to be such a such a

2024
01:51:15,100 --> 01:51:20,100
tremendous shift from what we've got
would be to go to a parliamentary system

2025
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:23,740
like Canada has,
for example,

2026
01:51:23,950 --> 01:51:28,950
where you represent your party and if
the other party gets enough,

2027
01:51:30,310 --> 01:51:34,210
they can vote,
vote you out without going through the

2028
01:51:34,211 --> 01:51:37,750
whole impeachment process.
There is no impeachment process.

2029
01:51:37,751 --> 01:51:42,250
The parties can form a coalition and
vote the prime minister out,

2030
01:51:42,490 --> 01:51:45,010
you know,
and it's much easier to topple a

2031
01:51:45,011 --> 01:51:47,200
government and in some ways that's a
good thing.

2032
01:51:47,350 --> 01:51:51,610
You know,
it's more resilient and Canada's a good,

2033
01:51:51,700 --> 01:51:53,140
you know,
there are many parliamentary

2034
01:51:53,141 --> 01:51:56,380
democracies,
but that's the one that's closest.

2035
01:51:56,830 --> 01:52:01,830
I think there's also an issue with
dealing with the real problems of the

2036
01:52:02,111 --> 01:52:07,111
world in
the time where they're the realities of

2037
01:52:07,631 --> 01:52:10,330
say Syria,
what's going on over there are so

2038
01:52:10,331 --> 01:52:15,280
horrific and they're so far removed from
the realities that we deal with here.

2039
01:52:15,730 --> 01:52:18,790
You,
you almost need to have someone who has

2040
01:52:18,850 --> 01:52:22,450
some sort of experience with those
people in those lands to understand and

2041
01:52:22,451 --> 01:52:27,451
put it into perspective and I think
we're entirely lacking of that

2042
01:52:27,701 --> 01:52:31,270
perspective.
Like in terms of our culture,

2043
01:52:31,570 --> 01:52:36,570
I don't think we understand what a
brutal military military dictatorship is

2044
01:52:36,731 --> 01:52:39,760
like.
I think we see it on television and it

2045
01:52:39,761 --> 01:52:44,500
seems almost too abstract,
but the president has to deal with that

2046
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:46,190
in a,
in a very real way

2047
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:50,300
and no one person can,
but that's what advisors are for.

2048
01:52:50,450 --> 01:52:53,030
Exactly.
But if you don't have good advisors or

2049
01:52:53,031 --> 01:52:56,720
if you choose to ignore them,
then you're in deep shit.

2050
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:58,160
Right?
I mean,

2051
01:52:58,450 --> 01:53:03,450
I mean donald appoints advisors who
already share his delusions of course.

2052
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:05,840
So there's nobody there to say,
wait a minute,

2053
01:53:06,290 --> 01:53:07,730
you're wrong.
You know,

2054
01:53:07,731 --> 01:53:10,370
and based on experience and expertise
and all this,

2055
01:53:10,371 --> 01:53:15,371
you're wrong and you need to rethink it.
That's what bothers me about one among

2056
01:53:17,451 --> 01:53:20,630
many things about the way that he
proceeds.

2057
01:53:20,660 --> 01:53:24,530
I mean,
the thing that bothers me most about the

2058
01:53:24,531 --> 01:53:29,531
change in administrations is that they
basically looked at climate change.

2059
01:53:30,340 --> 01:53:31,850
They said,
we don't believe it.

2060
01:53:31,851 --> 01:53:34,070
It's not happening.
We're not.

2061
01:53:34,071 --> 01:53:38,450
It's not even on the table,
and actually that needs to be the thing

2062
01:53:38,570 --> 01:53:41,420
on the table.
That should be the primary thing we're

2063
01:53:41,421 --> 01:53:46,421
talking about.
All this other stuff is important,

2064
01:53:46,580 --> 01:53:51,260
but we're talking about the accelerating
changes that are,

2065
01:53:51,320 --> 01:53:56,320
that are essentially under,
under mining the mechanisms that keep

2066
01:53:58,010 --> 01:54:00,440
the earth habitable by life.

2067
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:04,070
This is a pretty important issue.
And to have people that say,

2068
01:54:04,071 --> 01:54:05,170
well,
it isn't.

2069
01:54:05,430 --> 01:54:08,960
We don't believe in climate change.
Well I'm sorry,

2070
01:54:08,961 --> 01:54:12,170
climate change is real.
I don't care what the fuck you believe

2071
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:17,440
it is real and free for this
administration to not only ignore it,

2072
01:54:17,721 --> 01:54:22,721
but then roll back all these other
measures that were put into place is a,

2073
01:54:24,140 --> 01:54:26,330
you know,
it's just the stupidest idea.

2074
01:54:26,331 --> 01:54:30,050
I couldn't imagine not just roll back,
but removing the funding for monitoring

2075
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:34,100
removing is really scary.
Suppressing the inflammation and all

2076
01:54:34,101 --> 01:54:35,480
this.
So,

2077
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:37,910
you know,
if you look at the people in the,

2078
01:54:38,060 --> 01:54:41,360
in the trump administration,
they're either from the energy industry,

2079
01:54:41,690 --> 01:54:43,530
Rex Tillerson,
you know,

2080
01:54:44,300 --> 01:54:48,550
I think the government has become
essentially a subsidiary of Exxonmobil

2081
01:54:49,650 --> 01:54:52,340
and not the other way around.
And so,

2082
01:54:52,370 --> 01:54:53,960
you know,
that's uh,

2083
01:54:53,961 --> 01:54:56,000
that's what they're doing.
And that's terrifying.

2084
01:54:56,001 --> 01:54:58,790
You know,
it's Goldman Sachs or Exxon Mobil.

2085
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:01,400
I mean,
corporations around the world.

2086
01:55:01,401 --> 01:55:04,010
We've known this for a long time.
Governments are just,

2087
01:55:04,011 --> 01:55:07,930
puppets does this.
In some ways it's just too eerily

2088
01:55:07,940 --> 01:55:10,410
parallel to what we're talking about,
what the rainforest,

2089
01:55:10,610 --> 01:55:15,470
like with all these,
all this potential in the rainforest and

2090
01:55:15,471 --> 01:55:18,530
almost this race,
the race to see like,

2091
01:55:18,770 --> 01:55:22,190
can we get to these incredible new
plants that we haven't discovered

2092
01:55:22,340 --> 01:55:24,830
before?
We fuck it up by cutting down all the

2093
01:55:24,831 --> 01:55:29,831
hardwoods and burning all the forest.
Can we get to this potential future

2094
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:35,420
utopia of people being able to read each
other's minds.

2095
01:55:35,421 --> 01:55:37,900
Being able to communicate simultaneously
all throughout the winter,

2096
01:55:38,060 --> 01:55:40,610
understanding each other regardless of
language.

2097
01:55:40,611 --> 01:55:44,070
Can we get to that before we blow up,
before we

2098
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:47,850
get into a nuclear war with North Korea?
And it is crazy shit,

2099
01:55:47,950 --> 01:55:50,400
right?
This insane administration that's

2100
01:55:50,401 --> 01:55:55,401
existing in this sort of chaotic manner
alongside some of the brightest minds

2101
01:55:56,251 --> 01:55:58,620
and most innovative people that have
ever walked the face of the planet that

2102
01:55:58,621 --> 01:56:03,621
are influencing things in a way today
that it's really unparalleled in terms

2103
01:56:03,631 --> 01:56:06,690
of human history,
the potential that any new invention or

2104
01:56:06,691 --> 01:56:11,691
innovation can enact,
whether it's understanding new compounds

2105
01:56:11,851 --> 01:56:14,790
that we discovered in the rain forest or
some new technology that's made in

2106
01:56:14,791 --> 01:56:16,200
Silicon Valley.
I mean,

2107
01:56:16,350 --> 01:56:18,540
it's an amazing,
amazing parallel.

2108
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:19,861
Yeah,
no,

2109
01:56:19,861 --> 01:56:22,230
I agree.
It does seem like it does seem like a

2110
01:56:22,231 --> 01:56:26,550
race in some ways between idiocy and
genius.

2111
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:31,460
They're incredibly brilliant people and
they're developing.

2112
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:34,110
I mean,
there are solutions to the problems that

2113
01:56:34,111 --> 01:56:35,190
face us.
Right?

2114
01:56:35,610 --> 01:56:38,550
But they have on the other side,
you have the know nothings,

2115
01:56:38,551 --> 01:56:40,680
you know,
who are marching into the future,

2116
01:56:41,010 --> 01:56:43,410
eyes firmly fixed on the rear view
mirror.

2117
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:44,640
It's like,
oh yeah,

2118
01:56:44,640 --> 01:56:47,280
coal technology.
That's the greatest thing.

2119
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:49,410
Let's go back to that.
I mean,

2120
01:56:49,740 --> 01:56:51,700
is that stupid or what?
You know,

2121
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:56,430
cold technology is obsolete.
It's stupid and you know,

2122
01:56:56,431 --> 01:56:58,410
there are better solutions,
you know,

2123
01:56:58,411 --> 01:57:00,460
or the whole attitude towards drugs.
Oh,

2124
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:02,790
the war on drugs.
The war on drugs was great.

2125
01:57:03,090 --> 01:57:06,390
Let's go back to that.
I mean these are people who are not

2126
01:57:06,750 --> 01:57:11,750
living in the present for one thing,
not planning for the future and they

2127
01:57:11,761 --> 01:57:14,340
don't really want to know.
It's like our minds are made up.

2128
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:17,970
We know drug abuse has got to be bad,
so let's prohibit it.

2129
01:57:17,971 --> 01:57:22,500
Let's go back to the old model.
They're not capable of entertaining a

2130
01:57:22,590 --> 01:57:25,100
new ideas and that's a problem.
You know,

2131
01:57:25,290 --> 01:57:28,470
what do you think about the idea,
and I've heard this brought up and I've,

2132
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:33,500
I've entertained at my own self that
maybe we need some sort of enemy or some

2133
01:57:34,681 --> 01:57:39,681
sort of thing to resist in order to rise
to the full potential of innovation,

2134
01:57:39,841 --> 01:57:43,920
of ideas of that we almost need some
sort of mountain to conquer.

2135
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:47,010
We need some sort of a force to be aware
of.

2136
01:57:47,220 --> 01:57:49,590
It really makes people rise up,
but I've seen more,

2137
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:55,100
more people politically active and
politically engaged now post election

2138
01:57:55,290 --> 01:57:58,710
than I ever did before the election
because I didn't expect trump to win.

2139
01:57:58,780 --> 01:58:00,300
Right.
And now that he did,

2140
01:58:00,301 --> 01:58:05,160
it's like it's raised up this resistance
to this insane level that I've never

2141
01:58:05,161 --> 01:58:06,930
experienced before in my life.
I mean,

2142
01:58:06,931 --> 01:58:09,720
it feels to me like Kent State all over
again.

2143
01:58:09,721 --> 01:58:13,260
It feels to know where it was a real
shock that he won.

2144
01:58:13,261 --> 01:58:14,190
And it's,
it.

2145
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:16,260
I agree.
It's been a wake up call.

2146
01:58:16,770 --> 01:58:20,760
So now there is this strong resistance,
um,

2147
01:58:20,790 --> 01:58:22,290
movement,
um,

2148
01:58:22,380 --> 01:58:26,430
and there.
And that's a good thing that that's

2149
01:58:26,431 --> 01:58:30,540
happened at also journalism.
How suddenly found itself again,

2150
01:58:31,050 --> 01:58:32,790
you know,
some journalists,

2151
01:58:33,130 --> 01:58:36,090
some sectors of it are beginning to,
you know,

2152
01:58:36,150 --> 01:58:38,940
for so long they were essentially
stenographers.

2153
01:58:38,950 --> 01:58:41,300
They would repeat whatever the
mouthpieces,

2154
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:42,273
the government.

2155
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:47,310
Now the journalists are questioning
everything and asking tough questions of

2156
01:58:48,131 --> 01:58:51,340
these clowns.
I'm expecting answers and it's kind of

2157
01:58:51,341 --> 01:58:51,820
like,
you know,

2158
01:58:51,820 --> 01:58:54,490
when I was young,
I wanted it to be a journalist,

2159
01:58:54,491 --> 01:58:57,760
right?
I thought Walter cronkite was the cat's

2160
01:58:57,850 --> 01:59:00,340
pajamas.
I wanted to be like him,

2161
01:59:00,341 --> 01:59:03,070
I wanted or I wanted it to be a foreign
correspondent.

2162
01:59:04,060 --> 01:59:09,060
I just admire journalism and for a long
time I have not found anything to admire

2163
01:59:09,251 --> 01:59:10,360
in it.
It's like they're,

2164
01:59:10,690 --> 01:59:13,000
they've all been lobotomized or
something,

2165
01:59:13,740 --> 01:59:15,670
but they're rediscovering it,
you know,

2166
01:59:15,671 --> 01:59:20,200
the good ones are rediscovering it and
the reemergence of investigative

2167
01:59:20,230 --> 01:59:23,320
journalism.
And right now I think that's the,

2168
01:59:23,620 --> 01:59:25,960
you know,
that's our best hope because I think

2169
01:59:25,961 --> 01:59:26,794
that,
uh,

2170
01:59:27,700 --> 01:59:30,190
these guys,
they'll just keep digging.

2171
01:59:30,250 --> 01:59:34,120
There's going to be so much bad stuff
come up about trump and the oldest

2172
01:59:34,121 --> 01:59:37,030
collusion with the Russians and,
you know,

2173
01:59:37,031 --> 01:59:40,720
um,
potentially enough to impeach him.

2174
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:45,010
The question is,
will the Republicans find enough spine

2175
01:59:45,011 --> 01:59:46,200
to,
uh,

2176
01:59:46,340 --> 01:59:47,530
you know,
to do that.

2177
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:50,320
But they did with Nixon.
Yeah.

2178
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:52,120
You know,
and I think some,

2179
01:59:52,180 --> 01:59:55,300
I mean,
what he did was not nearly as bad as

2180
01:59:55,301 --> 01:59:59,020
what trump is doing and so we'll see
where it goes,

2181
01:59:59,021 --> 02:00:02,080
but shameless in a way that Nixon never
watch shameless.

2182
02:00:02,370 --> 02:00:02,860
And,
and,

2183
02:00:02,860 --> 02:00:03,551
uh,
you know,

2184
02:00:03,551 --> 02:00:08,551
I,
I take a certain comfort in the thought

2185
02:00:09,611 --> 02:00:10,610
that,
uh,

2186
02:00:10,660 --> 02:00:13,060
you know,
they have all these draconian things.

2187
02:00:13,090 --> 02:00:16,240
They want to do a rollback,
all the environmental regulations,

2188
02:00:16,720 --> 02:00:18,770
whole immigration thing,
uh,

2189
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:20,650
you know,
a war on drugs,

2190
02:00:20,950 --> 02:00:25,270
but none of it is going to happen.
None of it actually will happen with the

2191
02:00:25,271 --> 02:00:27,820
immigration stuff is pretty real here in
California.

2192
02:00:27,821 --> 02:00:28,350
I mean,
they,

2193
02:00:28,350 --> 02:00:32,310
I see he is showing up at home depots.
They showed up at home people's.

2194
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:37,320
I have a friend who was born in America,
he's Mexican and they asked him where he

2195
02:00:37,521 --> 02:00:38,420
was born.
They pulled me,

2196
02:00:38,421 --> 02:00:42,140
he's a veteran and he knew like how to
deal with this and he knew what's legal

2197
02:00:42,141 --> 02:00:43,120
and what's not.
And you know,

2198
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:46,250
it's a grown man.
He's in his fifties and the citizen

2199
02:00:46,470 --> 02:00:51,470
citizen and a veteran,
he served the country in Iraq.

2200
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:54,230
And so they're coming up to him and ask
him,

2201
02:00:54,590 --> 02:00:56,120
where are you born?
And he's like,

2202
02:00:56,121 --> 02:00:58,060
you can't ask me that.
Know was like,

2203
02:00:58,070 --> 02:00:59,480
you don't,
you're not allowed to ask me where I'm

2204
02:00:59,481 --> 02:01:00,314
born.
And then,

2205
02:01:00,620 --> 02:01:01,341
you know,
he says,

2206
02:01:01,341 --> 02:01:03,920
who are you?
And what were immigration and whatever

2207
02:01:03,921 --> 02:01:05,690
the ice stands for,
and he goes,

2208
02:01:05,691 --> 02:01:07,950
let me see some documentation,
and the guy shows him his badge and his

2209
02:01:07,951 --> 02:01:08,301
gun.
He goes,

2210
02:01:08,301 --> 02:01:11,090
that's not your fucking documentation.
Pull out your goddamn documentation.

2211
02:01:11,300 --> 02:01:12,950
And he pulls out his military id.
It's like,

2212
02:01:12,951 --> 02:01:14,510
look,
here's my documentation.

2213
02:01:14,690 --> 02:01:16,100
This is me.
Who the fuck are you?

2214
02:01:16,650 --> 02:01:18,050
Why are you asking people where they're
born?

2215
02:01:18,051 --> 02:01:19,580
I was born in California.
Okay.

2216
02:01:19,581 --> 02:01:22,220
You're not allowed to just go up to
people and ask them where they're born,

2217
02:01:22,430 --> 02:01:25,940
but people that don't know that they're,
they're getting arrested,

2218
02:01:25,970 --> 02:01:27,770
they're getting taken and they're
getting deported.

2219
02:01:27,771 --> 02:01:31,130
They're taking people that are dropping
off their children at school,

2220
02:01:31,610 --> 02:01:35,690
the grabbing people and there's a bunch
of cases of this and you're just hearing

2221
02:01:35,691 --> 02:01:40,580
about the cases that get to the press.
So many them that you're never going to

2222
02:01:40,581 --> 02:01:43,310
hear about.
And this is just rampant and this never

2223
02:01:43,311 --> 02:01:45,800
existed before.
Not In the Bush administration.

2224
02:01:46,110 --> 02:01:47,930
No,
I mean not in Bush.

2225
02:01:47,931 --> 02:01:50,870
Senior immediate just didn't happen
before in any conservative

2226
02:01:50,871 --> 02:01:52,970
administration.
They didn't treat it like this.

2227
02:01:52,971 --> 02:01:54,050
This is a weird time.

2228
02:01:54,450 --> 02:01:55,890
Yeah,
it is a very weird time,

2229
02:01:55,980 --> 02:01:57,540
but I think it's temporary.

2230
02:01:57,800 --> 02:01:58,571
Well,
I hope so,

2231
02:01:58,571 --> 02:02:01,510
but what you said about journalism,
I think it's important to point out that

2232
02:02:01,550 --> 02:02:03,820
the.
They're just as they fucked up,

2233
02:02:03,821 --> 02:02:05,860
just as hard with the left as they did
with the right.

2234
02:02:06,220 --> 02:02:08,500
I mean they,
they let the Clintons get away with a

2235
02:02:08,501 --> 02:02:11,020
lot of horseshit.
They gotta let Obama get away with a lot

2236
02:02:11,021 --> 02:02:12,020
of horseshit.
They,

2237
02:02:12,330 --> 02:02:14,350
they,
they said talking points.

2238
02:02:14,351 --> 02:02:17,560
They were given talking points and they
ran with those talking points so that

2239
02:02:17,561 --> 02:02:20,580
they would get access to the president
and they will get access to congressmen,

2240
02:02:20,581 --> 02:02:22,870
the senators,
and they did it forever and it wasn't

2241
02:02:22,871 --> 02:02:26,980
journalism and you're right and they're
the reason why this guy got into place

2242
02:02:26,981 --> 02:02:28,750
in this,
in this situation right now.

2243
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:33,960
It's just as much of a fault of them
have not holding the left to the fire as

2244
02:02:35,201 --> 02:02:36,130
it is to,
you know,

2245
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:37,180
what's going on right now.

2246
02:02:37,830 --> 02:02:38,700
Yeah,
I mean,

2247
02:02:38,701 --> 02:02:42,000
journalism has a lot to answer for it.
There's no doubt about it.

2248
02:02:42,090 --> 02:02:45,540
I just have a,
you know,

2249
02:02:45,541 --> 02:02:47,160
maybe it's a delusion.
I would just,

2250
02:02:47,220 --> 02:02:48,110
I would just,
I,

2251
02:02:48,160 --> 02:02:50,490
I liked,
I would like to think that journalism is

2252
02:02:50,491 --> 02:02:52,950
finding its voice and finding its
function.

2253
02:02:52,980 --> 02:02:54,780
Again,
it's function is to,

2254
02:02:55,290 --> 02:02:56,430
you know,
as somebody said,

2255
02:02:56,431 --> 02:02:58,020
I think it was I have stone,
you know,

2256
02:02:58,021 --> 02:03:02,310
the function is to comfort the afflicted
and afflict the comfortable.

2257
02:03:02,311 --> 02:03:05,550
Right.
And that's essentially the journalistic

2258
02:03:05,551 --> 02:03:09,510
mandates or express the truth and the
truth,

2259
02:03:09,511 --> 02:03:12,420
see the truth and form.
Don't assume,

2260
02:03:12,990 --> 02:03:15,360
you know,
play the propaganda game,

2261
02:03:15,390 --> 02:03:19,520
be able to look beyond it and they have
to be in this environment and the,

2262
02:03:19,521 --> 02:03:22,410
where people keep calling fake news.
They have to be undeniable.

2263
02:03:22,830 --> 02:03:25,590
And I think in that sense they are
reinvigorated,

2264
02:03:25,670 --> 02:03:27,270
you know,
I mean that's one of the things that,

2265
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:28,440
you know,
you're,

2266
02:03:28,440 --> 02:03:32,520
you're seeing that's one of the things
that the times talked about like after

2267
02:03:32,521 --> 02:03:34,140
it was over,
after the election was over,

2268
02:03:34,141 --> 02:03:35,310
they were like,
we are,

2269
02:03:35,380 --> 02:03:39,660
we're going to reinvigorate,
refocused our dedication on journalism.

2270
02:03:40,590 --> 02:03:45,090
And I think that's a good sign.
Then the other side of it is that we can

2271
02:03:45,091 --> 02:03:46,600
just,
you know,

2272
02:03:46,620 --> 02:03:51,420
the way the trump administration
proceeds with all these things,

2273
02:03:51,421 --> 02:03:54,830
they wanted to,
the inevitably just get bogged down in

2274
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:57,830
litigation protest to the,
you know,

2275
02:03:58,110 --> 02:04:00,540
at some point they do have to answer to
Congress.

2276
02:04:01,530 --> 02:04:02,740
So I think,
you know,

2277
02:04:02,930 --> 02:04:06,360
I mean the wheels were already coming
off before he even took the oath of

2278
02:04:06,361 --> 02:04:09,240
office.
They've continued to come off and it's

2279
02:04:09,241 --> 02:04:14,241
just gonna get.
It's just a sort of a degenerate into

2280
02:04:15,450 --> 02:04:19,620
litigation acrimony and the ability to
get anything passed.

2281
02:04:19,621 --> 02:04:21,180
Uh,
you know,

2282
02:04:21,750 --> 02:04:24,690
which is all good.
I mean essentially in this case,

2283
02:04:24,691 --> 02:04:29,460
chaos is our friend because they won't
be able to advance this draconian

2284
02:04:29,461 --> 02:04:30,780
agenda.
Thank God.

2285
02:04:30,781 --> 02:04:34,950
And you know,
hopefully circumstances will enable us

2286
02:04:34,951 --> 02:04:37,550
to get rid of them quickly.
Yeah.

2287
02:04:37,620 --> 02:04:38,490
I don't know.
You know,

2288
02:04:38,491 --> 02:04:40,380
I'm,
I'm not entirely confident in that.

2289
02:04:41,020 --> 02:04:43,290
I just.
The whole thing to me when I'm looking

2290
02:04:43,291 --> 02:04:45,840
at these protests,
like what was going on yesterday where

2291
02:04:46,020 --> 02:04:49,140
people are just beating the shit out of
each other in the streets is people with

2292
02:04:49,141 --> 02:04:52,260
red hats.
Like the red hats are the bad people.

2293
02:04:52,261 --> 02:04:54,420
It's so strange.
It's so strange.

2294
02:04:54,421 --> 02:04:55,980
Scene people,
these make America great again.

2295
02:04:55,981 --> 02:05:00,180
Hats fighting with people that are
wearing masks and motorcycle helmets and

2296
02:05:00,181 --> 02:05:03,540
their sticks and people were throwing
smoke bombs.

2297
02:05:03,541 --> 02:05:04,980
I'm like,
this is crazy.

2298
02:05:04,981 --> 02:05:09,981
I really never thought we'd see such a
clear right versus left civil war.

2299
02:05:11,010 --> 02:05:13,080
In fact,
like these little battles,

2300
02:05:13,270 --> 02:05:17,430
it seems to be ramping up and becoming
more and more common and,

2301
02:05:17,431 --> 02:05:19,350
and,
and becoming more and more violent.

2302
02:05:19,740 --> 02:05:21,510
Yeah,
it seems that it is,

2303
02:05:21,570 --> 02:05:24,060
you know,
but so what can we do?

2304
02:05:24,270 --> 02:05:27,420
You know,
we're not out on the streets protesting

2305
02:05:27,421 --> 02:05:28,990
on one side or another.
I mean,

2306
02:05:28,991 --> 02:05:30,150
I,
I,

2307
02:05:30,300 --> 02:05:30,930
I,
uh,

2308
02:05:30,930 --> 02:05:34,200
you know,
and then basically I think for me,

2309
02:05:35,880 --> 02:05:38,370
I continue to do it what I'm doing
because I think,

2310
02:05:38,490 --> 02:05:43,490
I think these plant medicines are the
single most important catalyst for

2311
02:05:43,531 --> 02:05:48,150
changing consciousness on a global level
and that's what has to happen.

2312
02:05:48,390 --> 02:05:52,230
So I'm not saying I have nothing
messianic about it.

2313
02:05:52,231 --> 02:05:53,310
I,
you know,

2314
02:05:53,311 --> 02:05:57,180
I tell people I work for the plants,
but I think it's valuable to bring

2315
02:05:57,181 --> 02:06:01,710
people to that experience in a place
that is safe.

2316
02:06:01,711 --> 02:06:03,810
They don't have to worry about those
issues.

2317
02:06:04,140 --> 02:06:07,800
They can have this direct download with
the mysterious tremendum,

2318
02:06:07,810 --> 02:06:11,280
if you want to call it that,
that can change hearts and minds.

2319
02:06:11,281 --> 02:06:15,210
I think that globally,
I think that Ios is a catalyst for that.

2320
02:06:15,270 --> 02:06:18,900
You know,
why has it suddenly gone global in the

2321
02:06:18,901 --> 02:06:21,060
last 20 years?
I think,

2322
02:06:21,270 --> 02:06:25,050
you know,
I think that it's a sign that Gaia,

2323
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:30,200
if you believe in that concept that the
earth itself is an intelligent entity is

2324
02:06:30,781 --> 02:06:34,860
give them a little bit hysterical and is
trying to get our attention,

2325
02:06:34,980 --> 02:06:38,700
you know,
wake up the monkeys and this is the way

2326
02:06:38,701 --> 02:06:42,600
it's.
So ios gives an ambassador from the

2327
02:06:42,601 --> 02:06:47,601
community of species to what I call the
programmatic primates.

2328
02:06:47,970 --> 02:06:52,200
You know,
this out of control species that,

2329
02:06:52,201 --> 02:06:53,160
uh,
needs,

2330
02:06:53,161 --> 02:06:56,680
uh,
a good talking to say,

2331
02:06:57,630 --> 02:07:00,120
wake up your recognized place.
You know,

2332
02:07:00,121 --> 02:07:01,650
and you don't have to.
Well,

2333
02:07:01,651 --> 02:07:02,700
it seems like so

2334
02:07:02,770 --> 02:07:05,710
systems always tried to balance
themselves out,

2335
02:07:05,870 --> 02:07:09,670
you know,
whether it's through warfare or disease

2336
02:07:09,700 --> 02:07:13,990
or some new government,
you surfing the old power or whether

2337
02:07:13,991 --> 02:07:18,460
it's through predators and prey and
there's always some weird sort of

2338
02:07:18,461 --> 02:07:23,461
reaction to some thing gaining too much
power and whether it's ideas or

2339
02:07:24,431 --> 02:07:29,431
ideologies or patterns that they gained
too much power and then something shows

2340
02:07:29,561 --> 02:07:34,390
up that sort of tends to diminish that
erode the very foundation of it.

2341
02:07:34,690 --> 02:07:36,220
That's,
that's what I feel

2342
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:41,080
about psychedelics that in many ways
what they're doing and even the sneaky

2343
02:07:41,081 --> 02:07:43,600
door,
like the people that talk about cannabis

2344
02:07:43,601 --> 02:07:44,670
being a,
you know,

2345
02:07:44,770 --> 02:07:49,540
some sort of a gateway drug.
It's not a gateway drug to the bad ones.

2346
02:07:49,720 --> 02:07:52,540
I think if anything,
it's a gateway drug to the ones that are

2347
02:07:52,541 --> 02:07:56,580
going to change the world.
If it doesn't do it on its own it,

2348
02:07:56,920 --> 02:07:57,460
you know,
I mean,

2349
02:07:57,460 --> 02:08:02,340
this concept of a gateway drug is,
you know,

2350
02:08:02,410 --> 02:08:04,490
it's just stupid.
In sense,

2351
02:08:04,690 --> 02:08:08,200
this is something that the drug warriors
have come up with.

2352
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:10,600
I mean,
I'm here to tell you,

2353
02:08:10,630 --> 02:08:14,470
coffee is a gateway drug.
Probably chocolate ice cream is a

2354
02:08:15,070 --> 02:08:18,110
gateway drug.
We've all taken these things and you

2355
02:08:18,111 --> 02:08:19,360
know,
look where we are now.

2356
02:08:19,460 --> 02:08:20,830
We,
you know,

2357
02:08:21,610 --> 02:08:25,510
so gateway drug,
it's just the concept is absurd.

2358
02:08:25,511 --> 02:08:28,090
What's it?
If it was sold in the,

2359
02:08:28,180 --> 02:08:32,230
in a environment where there were a
choice to have all sorts of other

2360
02:08:32,231 --> 02:08:34,390
illegal drugs,
they wouldn't be a gateway drug,

2361
02:08:34,391 --> 02:08:35,224
but it no.

2362
02:08:35,730 --> 02:08:39,460
Well the alcohol one is the most
ridiculous one because it's everywhere

2363
02:08:39,461 --> 02:08:42,700
and it's the one that inhibits your
really loosens your inhibitions more

2364
02:08:42,701 --> 02:08:46,300
than any other drug may is responsible
for the most foolish behavior.

2365
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:48,040
Yeah.
It's everywhere.

2366
02:08:48,041 --> 02:08:51,400
You can get it at every restaurant.
You can get it almost everywhere you go

2367
02:08:51,460 --> 02:08:53,350
this way.
Even to the point where it's not even

2368
02:08:53,351 --> 02:08:55,720
recognized as a drug.
Exactly.

2369
02:08:55,810 --> 02:08:59,020
Cognitive dissonance for years,
you know,

2370
02:08:59,021 --> 02:09:04,021
the FDA could not classify tobacco as a
drug because it was a different

2371
02:09:05,170 --> 02:09:06,490
regulatory framework.
Well,

2372
02:09:06,491 --> 02:09:09,190
of course it's a drug,
you know,

2373
02:09:09,250 --> 02:09:11,110
and somebody said,
yeah,

2374
02:09:11,111 --> 02:09:15,460
it's the only drug you can use when used
as instructed will kill you.

2375
02:09:18,180 --> 02:09:21,820
That's hilarious.
Isn't it funny that the word drug,

2376
02:09:21,821 --> 02:09:22,680
I'm not funny,
but it's,

2377
02:09:22,690 --> 02:09:26,680
isn't it problematic at the very least
that the drug is sort of this gigantic

2378
02:09:26,681 --> 02:09:30,850
blanket that we throw over all these
things that perturb consciousness,

2379
02:09:31,060 --> 02:09:32,220
right?
Wrong,

2380
02:09:32,330 --> 02:09:35,170
good and bad,
positive and negative.

2381
02:09:35,410 --> 02:09:37,960
No beneficial effects whatsoever.
And this is,

2382
02:09:38,470 --> 02:09:43,030
this is another reason.
This is another example of why this

2383
02:09:43,031 --> 02:09:48,010
conversation about drugs is so shallow
because we're talking about drugs.

2384
02:09:48,760 --> 02:09:52,450
Completely scary.
You say people don't use drugs.

2385
02:09:52,630 --> 02:09:57,630
What about what about which drugs?
When we talk about which drugs,

2386
02:09:57,821 --> 02:10:00,940
because there's thousands of drugs.
So which one are we talking about?

2387
02:10:01,120 --> 02:10:05,290
Or we just battled drugs.
Just calling them drugs is a problem.

2388
02:10:07,040 --> 02:10:10,360
Could you call dmt the same thing that
you call alcohol?

2389
02:10:10,450 --> 02:10:14,770
It seems to me to be so crazy.
It's just not a useful term.

2390
02:10:14,830 --> 02:10:15,663
Right?
You know?

2391
02:10:15,760 --> 02:10:17,710
Um,
and then also,

2392
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:21,670
I mean the problem that they're facing
and that we have to acknowledge,

2393
02:10:21,820 --> 02:10:25,390
which I've been saying a lot lately,
as you know,

2394
02:10:25,540 --> 02:10:27,750
we're made of drugs,
right?

2395
02:10:28,350 --> 02:10:29,260
Drugs,
work.

2396
02:10:29,320 --> 02:10:32,620
We are made of drugs,
right?

2397
02:10:32,680 --> 02:10:37,680
We're biochemical engines that run on
trucks which are neurotransmitters and

2398
02:10:38,841 --> 02:10:42,080
hormones.
And enzymes and all of these things and

2399
02:10:42,140 --> 02:10:44,870
biochemical system,
they're involved with signal

2400
02:10:44,871 --> 02:10:49,760
transduction with organisms are networks
of communication.

2401
02:10:50,120 --> 02:10:53,240
They're mediated by neurotransmitters,
neurotransmitters,

2402
02:10:53,241 --> 02:10:57,410
if you isolated them from the brain,
put them into a bottle and sold them.

2403
02:10:57,470 --> 02:10:59,710
That would be a drug,
will they?

2404
02:10:59,740 --> 02:11:04,340
These are drugs.
So this idea that we are inherently

2405
02:11:04,341 --> 02:11:08,900
biochemical systems and people don't
want to acknowledge that,

2406
02:11:09,530 --> 02:11:11,240
but that's the truth.
You know,

2407
02:11:11,241 --> 02:11:15,650
we're made of drugs.
So the people that want to have the drug

2408
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:18,590
free America,
I'm sorry,

2409
02:11:20,100 --> 02:11:23,930
we're made out of drugs.
Drugs are built into who we are.

2410
02:11:24,010 --> 02:11:29,010
That's why drugs taken from plants or
from the outside have the effects that

2411
02:11:29,091 --> 02:11:30,110
they have,
you know,

2412
02:11:30,111 --> 02:11:33,790
because they affect these systems that
uh,

2413
02:11:33,830 --> 02:11:34,960
you know,
our,

2414
02:11:35,120 --> 02:11:36,620
our big brains.

2415
02:11:36,620 --> 02:11:39,380
This is kind of a consequence of
evolution.

2416
02:11:39,381 --> 02:11:42,320
You know,
we have these enormous brains that

2417
02:11:42,330 --> 02:11:45,620
evolved very quickly and we like
novelty.

2418
02:11:45,650 --> 02:11:48,260
You know,
we have all of these brain receptors.

2419
02:11:48,261 --> 02:11:52,250
We like to.
We'd like to stimulate those receptors

2420
02:11:52,251 --> 02:11:57,251
because it makes us feel good or it's
interesting or for all sorts of reasons.

2421
02:11:58,190 --> 02:12:00,980
We like to tweak our states of
consciousness.

2422
02:12:01,460 --> 02:12:05,240
It's just built into who we are and it's
not a bad thing.

2423
02:12:05,420 --> 02:12:07,220
Well,
this is a problem with the way you're

2424
02:12:07,221 --> 02:12:11,420
thinking.
You have too many facts and use too much

2425
02:12:11,421 --> 02:12:16,340
science and you don't have enough Jesus,
Jesus in your life.

2426
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:19,040
If you have Jesus,
you wouldn't need all this nonsense,

2427
02:12:19,230 --> 02:12:21,680
and then that jeff sessions would make
sense to you.

2428
02:12:21,710 --> 02:12:23,150
Right?
That may be true,

2429
02:12:23,210 --> 02:12:26,140
but unfortunately I don't.
So yeah,

2430
02:12:26,150 --> 02:12:30,440
I'll just continue to be diluted.
Believe in science is so important,

2431
02:12:30,450 --> 02:12:33,680
so that makes that so important that you
embraced Jesus and you just

2432
02:12:35,400 --> 02:12:36,230
can't do it.

2433
02:12:36,230 --> 02:12:39,550
I mean,
I know I'm a recovering Catholic.

2434
02:12:39,551 --> 02:12:40,820
I've been there.
I know.

2435
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:43,220
I know the drill.
I know the territory,

2436
02:12:43,660 --> 02:12:46,550
but it's really.
In all honesty though,

2437
02:12:46,551 --> 02:12:50,510
it's so important that you are saying
these things so people can change their

2438
02:12:50,511 --> 02:12:51,980
perspective.
When they realized that,

2439
02:12:52,010 --> 02:12:54,500
oh yeah,
we are really just water balloons of

2440
02:12:54,501 --> 02:12:57,250
drugs were just filled up with it.
I mean we're,

2441
02:12:57,420 --> 02:13:00,950
that's what operates the whole thing.
That essentially is what we are.

2442
02:13:00,980 --> 02:13:03,350
That's what adrenaline is.
All these different things are.

2443
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:05,720
No,
I didn't say it first.

2444
02:13:05,730 --> 02:13:07,760
You know who said it?
It was Salvador Dali.

2445
02:13:08,420 --> 02:13:12,140
They said,
so how do you come up with the ideas for

2446
02:13:12,141 --> 02:13:15,920
all these crazy art do you do?
You must be on drugs,

2447
02:13:15,921 --> 02:13:16,491
right?
He said,

2448
02:13:16,491 --> 02:13:18,410
no,
I am drugs.

2449
02:13:19,430 --> 02:13:22,430
Which I guess that put the conversation
to an end.

2450
02:13:22,431 --> 02:13:24,620
So if you think about it,
it's quite true.

2451
02:13:25,160 --> 02:13:27,870
I'm speaking of are,
you know,

2452
02:13:28,070 --> 02:13:30,470
without.
I don't want to get too far down this,

2453
02:13:30,471 --> 02:13:33,810
but a lot.
The problem with organized religion I

2454
02:13:33,811 --> 02:13:37,740
think is that it denies biology,
right?

2455
02:13:37,770 --> 02:13:39,360
Right.
The idea of students.

2456
02:13:39,420 --> 02:13:42,090
Yeah.
Somehow being in the body,

2457
02:13:42,150 --> 02:13:47,150
being this chemical system and enjoying
what it is to be that is forbidden

2458
02:13:48,481 --> 02:13:51,120
somehow,
and this is partly a reflection of our

2459
02:13:52,170 --> 02:13:54,640
devaluation of nature,
you know,

2460
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:57,840
which is at.
That includes our own nature as well as

2461
02:13:57,841 --> 02:14:01,860
nature out there.
Psychedelics are the antidote to this,

2462
02:14:02,250 --> 02:14:04,950
right?
They make you appreciate your

2463
02:14:04,951 --> 02:14:09,951
relationship with nature so they they
can catalyze changes.

2464
02:14:10,350 --> 02:14:14,160
A consciousness.
That's why I say the most effective

2465
02:14:14,161 --> 02:14:19,161
thing that I can do as somebody who's
concerned with the planet is bring

2466
02:14:19,381 --> 02:14:24,381
people to situations where they can
encounter the medicine and make of it

2467
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:27,120
what they will.
I know I'm not there to tell them what

2468
02:14:27,121 --> 02:14:27,900
to make of it.

2469
02:14:27,900 --> 02:14:32,340
I'm there to tell them this will be the
most intense personal experience that

2470
02:14:32,341 --> 02:14:36,810
you'll ever have.
It's up to you how you evaluated it and

2471
02:14:36,811 --> 02:14:38,400
you can't tell them because in all
honesty,

2472
02:14:38,401 --> 02:14:41,190
you're still working out yourself and
I'm certainly,

2473
02:14:41,191 --> 02:14:45,600
I don't want it.
I'm a big believer in use your own mind.

2474
02:14:45,640 --> 02:14:49,350
Use Your own brain to work this out and
that's what we have it.

2475
02:14:49,460 --> 02:14:52,080
You know,
that's one of the most important things

2476
02:14:52,081 --> 02:14:55,070
about recognizing someone who's a,
you know,

2477
02:14:55,071 --> 02:14:57,870
a quote unquote fake shaman or someone
who's using it wrong.

2478
02:14:58,020 --> 02:15:01,260
Someone is telling you exactly what it
is and what you're going to experience

2479
02:15:01,261 --> 02:15:03,870
like no.
One of the most beautiful things that

2480
02:15:03,871 --> 02:15:07,560
psychedelics drugs,
psychedelic drugs do as they dissolve.

2481
02:15:07,561 --> 02:15:10,890
Any notion that you might have that
anyone has a hold of this thing.

2482
02:15:10,920 --> 02:15:12,900
Yes,
very much so.

2483
02:15:13,020 --> 02:15:17,790
That is exactly right.
If somebody tells me I'm a great

2484
02:15:17,791 --> 02:15:20,220
showman,
I'm gonna lead you through this,

2485
02:15:20,221 --> 02:15:22,740
I'll,
you know I'm out of there because they

2486
02:15:22,770 --> 02:15:25,980
obviously have not understood what it
is.

2487
02:15:25,980 --> 02:15:30,500
If somebody says I'm not a shop and I
just helped,

2488
02:15:31,110 --> 02:15:33,000
I just held.
I just want to facilitate,

2489
02:15:33,010 --> 02:15:37,160
you know,
it's the medicine that there's a shaman

2490
02:15:37,180 --> 02:15:39,870
will say I'm not a showman.
I just know a few tricks.

2491
02:15:39,990 --> 02:15:42,180
That guy is the guy.
I want a drink.

2492
02:15:42,181 --> 02:15:43,830
Yeah.
I just got a few tricks.

2493
02:15:44,580 --> 02:15:45,990
Tricks.
If you have trouble,

2494
02:15:45,991 --> 02:15:48,390
I can help you.
Otherwise I'll just step back and let

2495
02:15:48,391 --> 02:15:49,470
you do it.
You know,

2496
02:15:49,471 --> 02:15:53,520
and that's,
that's the essential thing because the

2497
02:15:53,580 --> 02:15:56,760
medicine itself is the showman.
While I have you here,

2498
02:15:56,790 --> 02:15:59,370
I have to ask you two questions because
I keep forgetting to do this.

2499
02:15:59,440 --> 02:16:00,900
Do this.
First of all,

2500
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:03,720
cannabinoid receptors,
what is the relationship between

2501
02:16:03,721 --> 02:16:08,721
cannabinoid receptors in human beings
and the actual use of cannabis or the

2502
02:16:09,271 --> 02:16:13,560
evolutionary use of cannabis?
Like over the course of human

2503
02:16:13,561 --> 02:16:18,561
development is our cannabinoid receptors
in place because people have consumed

2504
02:16:18,931 --> 02:16:23,070
cannabis throughout history or they had
just a natural function of biology?

2505
02:16:23,280 --> 02:16:25,950
No,
there a natural function of biology,

2506
02:16:25,980 --> 02:16:27,660
like a lot of these things,
you know,

2507
02:16:27,661 --> 02:16:29,770
like opiate receptors,
the same thing,

2508
02:16:30,880 --> 02:16:35,880
cannabinoid receptors and there are many
kinds and they're all over the body.

2509
02:16:37,091 --> 02:16:39,760
They're not just in the brain,
they do all sorts of things.

2510
02:16:39,761 --> 02:16:44,140
They're involved with immune functions
and inflammation and it's quite

2511
02:16:44,141 --> 02:16:47,140
complicated,
which is why cbd oil works and it's not

2512
02:16:47,141 --> 02:16:49,960
psychoactive,
not psychoactive at works on different

2513
02:16:49,961 --> 02:16:52,300
receptors.
There's at least three kinds of

2514
02:16:52,570 --> 02:16:57,570
cannabinoid receptors and evolutionarily
they,

2515
02:16:59,210 --> 02:17:00,011
you know,
they,

2516
02:17:00,011 --> 02:17:04,270
they're not contaminated receptors.
There's the endocannabinoid system.

2517
02:17:04,271 --> 02:17:08,140
They are,
they are responsive to things that we

2518
02:17:08,141 --> 02:17:11,950
make in the body.
Like a Nanda mind and there's another

2519
02:17:12,010 --> 02:17:14,530
one who I always,
which I always forget,

2520
02:17:14,531 --> 02:17:19,531
but these are indogenous compounds that
bind to cannabinoid receptors,

2521
02:17:19,870 --> 02:17:24,400
so just like their endogenous compounds
that bind to the opiate receptors.

2522
02:17:24,401 --> 02:17:28,180
These are peptides like endorphins and
enkephalins,

2523
02:17:28,290 --> 02:17:30,370
those sorts of things,
you know,

2524
02:17:31,930 --> 02:17:36,130
but the receptor is just happened to
bind these plant alkaloids,

2525
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:37,930
but that's not why they evolved.

2526
02:17:38,470 --> 02:17:41,500
You know,
they have functions in the body related

2527
02:17:41,501 --> 02:17:43,780
to analgesias and sleep and that sort of
thing.

2528
02:17:44,140 --> 02:17:48,220
Same with the contaminated receptors.
They evolved not because they were

2529
02:17:48,250 --> 02:17:52,810
cannabis plants out there,
but because the body made these

2530
02:17:53,350 --> 02:17:57,310
endocannabinoids and they mediated all
kinds of functions like Amanda,

2531
02:17:57,311 --> 02:17:58,270
my,
these things,

2532
02:17:58,271 --> 02:18:00,460
uh,
you know,

2533
02:18:00,461 --> 02:18:02,440
can I mentally,
it's a little different than something

2534
02:18:02,441 --> 02:18:06,340
like a,
like a dmt or Psilocybin,

2535
02:18:06,820 --> 02:18:11,820
which work kind of very specifically on
the serotonin receptors and that's how

2536
02:18:13,391 --> 02:18:16,960
they mediate their effects.
The effects of cannabinoids are more

2537
02:18:17,470 --> 02:18:19,960
widespread.
You could say more multi,

2538
02:18:19,990 --> 02:18:24,990
multi valence is maybe a good word,
but it's not because the plants were

2539
02:18:26,831 --> 02:18:28,510
there that we've,
all these things.

2540
02:18:28,511 --> 02:18:31,000
We had this,
we were neurologically,

2541
02:18:32,650 --> 02:18:36,850
no modern humans you might say,
and curious,

2542
02:18:36,851 --> 02:18:39,730
right?
Sampling and everything we could get our

2543
02:18:39,731 --> 02:18:42,460
hands on in the environment,
whether it's stuffing ended up,

2544
02:18:42,461 --> 02:18:45,610
our nose are usually drinking it or
whatever.

2545
02:18:46,270 --> 02:18:49,510
Naturally you're going to stumble over
these compounds because,

2546
02:18:49,511 --> 02:18:50,590
uh,
you know,

2547
02:18:50,800 --> 02:18:55,690
the bio is,
is these are just abundant in the bio.

2548
02:18:55,720 --> 02:18:59,170
So it's not really a chicken or the egg
sort of situation.

2549
02:18:59,171 --> 02:19:02,140
Like what came first,
the cannabinoid receptor or the

2550
02:19:02,260 --> 02:19:05,060
consumption of cannabis receptors were
there first.

2551
02:19:05,140 --> 02:19:07,460
How do we know that,
uh,

2552
02:19:08,080 --> 02:19:11,740
how do we know that?
Because we can actually trace,

2553
02:19:11,800 --> 02:19:14,260
we can trace the phylogeny of these
things,

2554
02:19:14,290 --> 02:19:18,820
you know,
we have molecular methods now where we

2555
02:19:18,821 --> 02:19:22,420
can actually traits the ancestry of
receptors,

2556
02:19:22,480 --> 02:19:23,920
right?
For example,

2557
02:19:23,921 --> 02:19:25,900
we have ways to measure this.
So,

2558
02:19:26,540 --> 02:19:28,760
you know,
cannabinoid receptors,

2559
02:19:29,030 --> 02:19:31,880
you can look at the phylogeny and,
and you know,

2560
02:19:31,881 --> 02:19:36,830
they were present in the president in
mammals long before we were around,

2561
02:19:37,590 --> 02:19:39,550
you know,
and Tryptofan.

2562
02:19:39,610 --> 02:19:41,690
It's the same thing.
Tryptophan,

2563
02:19:41,691 --> 02:19:43,940
which is the amino acid we were talking
about,

2564
02:19:44,490 --> 02:19:47,270
precursor to many of these psychedelics,
right?

2565
02:19:47,720 --> 02:19:51,200
So how old is tripped a fan as an amino
acid?

2566
02:19:51,230 --> 02:19:56,230
You can look back at the phylogeny,
turns out damn old,

2567
02:19:57,830 --> 02:20:02,720
possibly three point 8 billion years
old.

2568
02:20:02,780 --> 02:20:07,780
The genes for Tryptofan have been found
in phylogenetic groups that go back that

2569
02:20:09,801 --> 02:20:11,960
far.
The so called trip oppor on.

2570
02:20:12,020 --> 02:20:14,420
So,
you know,

2571
02:20:14,421 --> 02:20:17,420
so these things have been around for a
long time.

2572
02:20:17,750 --> 02:20:18,980
And uh,
you know,

2573
02:20:18,981 --> 02:20:21,650
in the most primitive organisms,
you know,

2574
02:20:21,730 --> 02:20:24,550
Serotonin is another good example.
Serotonin is,

2575
02:20:25,210 --> 02:20:29,720
which most of the psychedelics work on
Serotonin is thought to be the oldest

2576
02:20:30,020 --> 02:20:34,920
neurotransmitter phylogenetically older
than dopamine and norepinephrine.

2577
02:20:35,330 --> 02:20:37,440
Some of these other things,
Tryptofan,

2578
02:20:38,030 --> 02:20:42,380
Serotonin is receptors are very old,
uh,

2579
02:20:42,420 --> 02:20:47,420
phylogenetically evolutionarily.
So how does that correlate with a

2580
02:20:48,620 --> 02:20:50,430
runner's high,
um,

2581
02:20:50,480 --> 02:20:54,080
when,
when people have this runner's high and

2582
02:20:54,081 --> 02:20:57,620
apparently it has some sort of an effect
on cannabinoid receptors,

2583
02:20:58,070 --> 02:21:01,820
what is going on there and does it
actually mimic the high that someone

2584
02:21:01,821 --> 02:21:03,110
gets from consuming cannabis?

2585
02:21:03,530 --> 02:21:07,700
It May,
I've heard the runner's high discussed

2586
02:21:07,701 --> 02:21:10,400
in terms of the,
of the opiate receptors,

2587
02:21:10,410 --> 02:21:15,410
the endorphin and so on.
Maybe cannabis to what we do know is

2588
02:21:16,251 --> 02:21:21,251
that in states of high stress,
you can boost the production of these

2589
02:21:22,791 --> 02:21:27,110
indigenous compounds,
which is why high stress is one way to

2590
02:21:27,111 --> 02:21:30,170
induce altered states of consciousness
on the match.

2591
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:31,460
Right?
Oh,

2592
02:21:31,461 --> 02:21:35,750
I don't need drugs because I can,
I can run and get high or I can do

2593
02:21:35,751 --> 02:21:38,330
meditation and get high.
I'm sorry dude,

2594
02:21:38,360 --> 02:21:41,290
you're still on drugs.
Cars were made,

2595
02:21:41,540 --> 02:21:46,540
were made of drug and he figured out a
way to boost your endogenous DMT

2596
02:21:46,820 --> 02:21:51,440
cannabinoid.
So when PA getting crazy,

2597
02:21:51,470 --> 02:21:55,580
they're actually in some way doing some
sort of a natural drug trip.

2598
02:21:56,090 --> 02:21:57,230
Yeah.
Essentially,

2599
02:21:57,231 --> 02:22:02,231
because we are drugs,
there is no state you can experience

2600
02:22:03,140 --> 02:22:05,540
including the state that we're in right
now,

2601
02:22:05,930 --> 02:22:09,680
that is not a reflection of our
neurochemistry.

2602
02:22:10,760 --> 02:22:13,510
We're in a hallucination right now.
This is a,

2603
02:22:13,880 --> 02:22:18,410
you know,
this is a reality that our brains take

2604
02:22:18,440 --> 02:22:23,440
information in from the environment
through our sensory neural interface.

2605
02:22:23,721 --> 02:22:28,350
They combine it with
what we know from memories and

2606
02:22:28,351 --> 02:22:31,920
associations and the Cortex,
and they essentially create a model of

2607
02:22:31,921 --> 02:22:35,160
reality and that's the reality we're
inhabiting,

2608
02:22:35,190 --> 02:22:37,110
you know,
and a lot of what the brain does,

2609
02:22:37,111 --> 02:22:41,280
it receives information,
but a lot of the brain's function is to

2610
02:22:41,310 --> 02:22:43,770
filter stuff out.
You know,

2611
02:22:43,830 --> 02:22:47,520
if we received everything from the
environment all the time,

2612
02:22:47,521 --> 02:22:49,890
we'd be nuts.
We wouldn't be able to take it.

2613
02:22:50,430 --> 02:22:55,430
So there are these gating mechanisms,
it's called neural gating and we are

2614
02:22:56,400 --> 02:23:00,120
genetically programmed to and through
experience as well,

2615
02:23:00,720 --> 02:23:02,590
to,
uh,

2616
02:23:03,780 --> 02:23:07,800
to have these gating mechanisms that
filters a lot of stuff out so that we

2617
02:23:07,801 --> 02:23:11,460
can function.
Otherwise reality would be a blooming

2618
02:23:11,461 --> 02:23:13,320
buzzing confusion all the time.

2619
02:23:13,320 --> 02:23:15,240
We wouldn't be able to focus on
anything,

2620
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:17,920
you know.
So a lot of.

2621
02:23:18,030 --> 02:23:21,750
So for example,
gating is,

2622
02:23:21,810 --> 02:23:23,160
you know,
it's malleable,

2623
02:23:23,350 --> 02:23:28,350
it can change depending on the input.
So you're in a crowded restaurant for

2624
02:23:28,441 --> 02:23:29,510
example,
and there's,

2625
02:23:29,550 --> 02:23:31,590
it's hard to hear,
there's a lot of noise in the

2626
02:23:31,591 --> 02:23:36,591
background.
You adapt to that by filtering out most

2627
02:23:36,991 --> 02:23:38,430
of what's there,
right?

2628
02:23:38,431 --> 02:23:41,550
You just,
you can suppress it to some degrees so

2629
02:23:41,551 --> 02:23:44,070
you can talk to the person across from
you,

2630
02:23:44,071 --> 02:23:45,300
right?
You're not paying attention.

2631
02:23:45,690 --> 02:23:49,500
But at the next table you hear somebody
say your name,

2632
02:23:50,130 --> 02:23:53,160
suddenly you're gating mechanism,
you know,

2633
02:23:53,161 --> 02:23:55,470
you get that,
that gets through the filtering

2634
02:23:55,471 --> 02:23:57,600
mechanism itself.
Somebody is talking to me,

2635
02:23:57,601 --> 02:23:59,550
I wonder what they're saying about me
over there,

2636
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,260
you know,
that kind of thing.

2637
02:24:01,261 --> 02:24:05,160
So it relates,
but a lot of what the brain does when

2638
02:24:05,161 --> 02:24:08,940
you essentially create this
hallucination,

2639
02:24:09,090 --> 02:24:11,270
if you want to call it that,
a,

2640
02:24:11,550 --> 02:24:16,380
of the reality that we inhabit,
you can call it a model of reality.

2641
02:24:16,440 --> 02:24:20,790
It's not reality itself.
It's a reasonable facsimile of reality

2642
02:24:20,791 --> 02:24:23,550
that we inhabit and everybody's is
different.

2643
02:24:23,580 --> 02:24:26,160
Hence different views.
Everyone is different,

2644
02:24:26,161 --> 02:24:29,490
but close enough that we can talk to
each other and all that.

2645
02:24:29,491 --> 02:24:30,180
It's,
you know.

2646
02:24:30,180 --> 02:24:34,920
But it's not the pure objective reality,
you know,

2647
02:24:34,921 --> 02:24:38,010
which doesn't really exist.
Well it exists out there,

2648
02:24:38,011 --> 02:24:40,830
but we don't know what it looks,
but it doesn't exist to humans doesn't

2649
02:24:40,831 --> 02:24:42,870
exist to us.
We don't perceive it.

2650
02:24:42,960 --> 02:24:45,060
We receive our own art,
you know,

2651
02:24:45,061 --> 02:24:50,061
our own a model essentially of reality
and I think you explaining that

2652
02:24:52,560 --> 02:24:57,560
different experiences create literally
drug trips also can explain love affairs

2653
02:24:58,680 --> 02:25:03,000
where people become incredibly addicted
to each other and addicted to the

2654
02:25:03,001 --> 02:25:07,680
experience of being around the person
and what that does to you and that

2655
02:25:07,681 --> 02:25:10,560
literally you are on drugs when you were
someone of course.

2656
02:25:10,650 --> 02:25:12,840
And you know that's been studied,
right?

2657
02:25:12,840 --> 02:25:16,570
Yeah.
I mean oxytocin and probably opiate

2658
02:25:16,730 --> 02:25:21,730
movies in Saratoga mean all of these
things are part of what mediates

2659
02:25:23,480 --> 02:25:25,690
relationship,
including sex hormones.

2660
02:25:26,370 --> 02:25:28,120
So all of those things,
all of those things,

2661
02:25:28,210 --> 02:25:31,150
sex hormones,
tour psychoactive drugs in a certain

2662
02:25:31,151 --> 02:25:32,890
sense,
which is not to say,

2663
02:25:32,950 --> 02:25:37,780
I mean this is not saying that these
experiences are genuine or valuable or

2664
02:25:37,781 --> 02:25:40,810
anything.
They are obviously,

2665
02:25:40,990 --> 02:25:43,870
you know,
personal relationships are important.

2666
02:25:44,220 --> 02:25:49,220
It is not a to my mind,
it's not an evaluation to say we'll it's

2667
02:25:49,661 --> 02:25:51,640
chemically mediated.
Okay,

2668
02:25:51,700 --> 02:25:53,260
great.
It's chemically mediated.

2669
02:25:53,261 --> 02:25:56,080
That doesn't make it invalid.
In fact,

2670
02:25:56,081 --> 02:25:57,460
it means that,
well,

2671
02:25:57,520 --> 02:26:00,660
these molecules are pretty amazing.
They couldn't do that.

2672
02:26:01,030 --> 02:26:02,590
Well,
the feeling is fantastic.

2673
02:26:02,591 --> 02:26:04,750
Like why would that invalidate it?
It's still real.

2674
02:26:04,751 --> 02:26:06,610
It's still awesome,
but people,

2675
02:26:06,670 --> 02:26:07,900
you know,
again,

2676
02:26:07,901 --> 02:26:10,930
they have these artificial distinctions
about,

2677
02:26:10,931 --> 02:26:11,870
well,
you know,

2678
02:26:12,130 --> 02:26:17,130
my mystical experiences more valuable
than yours because you had to have

2679
02:26:17,321 --> 02:26:19,800
silicide and then I got there on that
couch,

2680
02:26:20,470 --> 02:26:22,570
but it wasn't on the match.

2681
02:26:22,720 --> 02:26:24,880
You know,
you're still a prisoner of your

2682
02:26:24,881 --> 02:26:26,560
neurochemistry.
No matter what.

2683
02:26:26,830 --> 02:26:31,830
It just so happens that silicide been,
is it drug taken in the right

2684
02:26:31,961 --> 02:26:36,010
circumstances,
in the right amount will reliably induce

2685
02:26:36,011 --> 02:26:39,430
a mystical experience.
Nothing wrong with that.

2686
02:26:40,810 --> 02:26:42,490
You don't.
You could even study it.

2687
02:26:42,491 --> 02:26:46,750
Suddenly science can study mystical
experiences because we have a reliable

2688
02:26:46,751 --> 02:26:51,700
trigger that will nine times out of 10
induce mystical experience in the right

2689
02:26:51,701 --> 02:26:54,110
circumstances.
So then we can take somebody.

2690
02:26:55,140 --> 02:26:57,880
Maybe somebody is meditated for 20
years,

2691
02:26:57,881 --> 02:27:01,930
are done yoga or done other things,
hoping that they might have a mystical

2692
02:27:01,931 --> 02:27:04,660
experience,
good for them,

2693
02:27:04,960 --> 02:27:08,830
but then you know,
you can take me an ordinary schmuck or

2694
02:27:08,831 --> 02:27:11,200
somebody like me who hasn't
particularly,

2695
02:27:11,230 --> 02:27:16,230
not particularly spiritually evolved,
but I can take solace Simon then.

2696
02:27:16,450 --> 02:27:17,680
Yeah,
it works.

2697
02:27:18,100 --> 02:27:23,050
That reminds me of a great story that
your brother told once about a,

2698
02:27:23,110 --> 02:27:26,320
uh,
a monk who studied a city of levitation

2699
02:27:26,830 --> 02:27:30,940
and uh,
he did it for like 30 years and then met

2700
02:27:30,941 --> 02:27:32,920
the Buddha and said,
look,

2701
02:27:32,921 --> 02:27:36,190
I can walk on water.
I've studied the city of levitation for

2702
02:27:36,191 --> 02:27:38,290
30 years and now I can walk across the
river.

2703
02:27:38,650 --> 02:27:39,490
And the Buddhist said,
yeah,

2704
02:27:39,491 --> 02:27:41,050
but the ferries,
only a nickel

2705
02:27:46,260 --> 02:27:47,110
30 years,
man,

2706
02:27:47,410 --> 02:27:51,130
you could've just taken mushrooms for
speaking of mushrooms is this is

2707
02:27:51,131 --> 02:27:53,350
something that I get wrong all the time.
It's one of the other things I wanted to

2708
02:27:53,351 --> 02:27:54,250
ask you.
What,

2709
02:27:54,730 --> 02:27:55,630
what is,
um,

2710
02:27:55,690 --> 02:28:00,690
there's some very close relationship
that mushrooms have and the absorption

2711
02:28:01,031 --> 02:28:03,800
of mushrooms have to dmt.
What,

2712
02:28:03,820 --> 02:28:07,780
what is the chemical differentiation?
Okay.

2713
02:28:07,810 --> 02:28:08,480
Very good.
Very,

2714
02:28:08,480 --> 02:28:10,660
very slight actually.
Um,

2715
02:28:13,550 --> 02:28:18,230
the temptation to start drawing
structures is almost irresistible.

2716
02:28:18,231 --> 02:28:19,430
Write some stuff down.
Go ahead.

2717
02:28:20,310 --> 02:28:21,143
Awesome.
Here has,

2718
02:28:21,410 --> 02:28:22,640
do we have a visual?
Now?

2719
02:28:22,641 --> 02:28:24,440
We don't,
but I'll save that piece of paper.

2720
02:28:24,441 --> 02:28:25,880
Okay.
Well,

2721
02:28:26,120 --> 02:28:28,910
uh,
I don't want to get too far into it,

2722
02:28:28,911 --> 02:28:30,440
but basically.
Okay.

2723
02:28:30,441 --> 02:28:34,940
So you've had organic chemistry.
Oh No,

2724
02:28:34,970 --> 02:28:35,860
no.
Okay.

2725
02:28:37,160 --> 02:28:41,060
Well then this spam organic chemistry,
you are what you are.

2726
02:28:41,061 --> 02:28:43,910
Organic Chemistry.
Well this may be a useless thing,

2727
02:28:43,911 --> 02:28:47,810
but
we could see it up on the wall here.

2728
02:28:47,840 --> 02:28:49,340
We've got it up on the screen.
Oh,

2729
02:28:49,490 --> 02:28:50,770
there you go.
Oh,

2730
02:28:50,771 --> 02:28:52,400
okay.
Well there you go.

2731
02:28:52,460 --> 02:28:53,480
Yeah,
we don't have to draw,

2732
02:28:53,490 --> 02:28:55,130
Struck.
You can look at it right here so you

2733
02:28:55,131 --> 02:28:56,990
don't have to turn around.
Look to your right Dennis.

2734
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:58,480
Turn test.
Well,

2735
02:28:59,210 --> 02:29:00,500
so.
Right.

2736
02:29:00,920 --> 02:29:03,980
So you can see if you've.
So there's Serotonin,

2737
02:29:03,981 --> 02:29:06,020
silicon and dimethyl trip to me.

2738
02:29:06,020 --> 02:29:09,280
Wow.
You can see that silicon and domiciled

2739
02:29:09,450 --> 02:29:11,930
trip to Maine are very close in
structure.

2740
02:29:11,931 --> 02:29:14,210
The only difference is that hydroxy
group,

2741
02:29:14,810 --> 02:29:17,030
that age group,
that's the only difference.

2742
02:29:17,031 --> 02:29:21,350
So with the silicon is exactly the same
thing as an end dimethyltryptamine.

2743
02:29:21,380 --> 02:29:25,940
That's correct.
Why that single trivial difference is

2744
02:29:25,941 --> 02:29:30,410
what makes tillison orally active and
I'm a whole trip to mean there's not.

2745
02:29:30,530 --> 02:29:32,750
Wow,
wow.

2746
02:29:32,751 --> 02:29:37,751
Because what's going on with that?
This static diagram,

2747
02:29:38,230 --> 02:29:41,320
the different molecular model would show
up,

2748
02:29:41,330 --> 02:29:45,920
but what's going on is that that
nitrogen there in when tillison's and

2749
02:29:46,100 --> 02:29:50,870
physiological solution,
the nitrogen is charged,

2750
02:29:51,080 --> 02:29:55,450
has a positive charge.
The oxygen doesn't have the h there,

2751
02:29:55,460 --> 02:30:00,460
it has a negative charge,
so the nitrogen curls back and is in

2752
02:30:02,121 --> 02:30:07,121
close association with the oxygen.
If this makes any sense,

2753
02:30:07,890 --> 02:30:12,890
so the enzyme can't get to it.
That's why it's orally active because

2754
02:30:13,011 --> 02:30:15,320
essentially it can't get to that
nitrogen.

2755
02:30:15,740 --> 02:30:18,950
What that enzyme does is cleave off that
nitrogen,

2756
02:30:18,951 --> 02:30:23,951
mano aiming oxidase.
It takes away that nitrogen and it can't

2757
02:30:24,921 --> 02:30:27,280
do it with allison,
so that's why I sold.

2758
02:30:27,281 --> 02:30:29,810
Listens orally active.
It doesn't require in them mail

2759
02:30:29,900 --> 02:30:33,050
inhibitor.
It's just in some ways it's the perfect

2760
02:30:33,051 --> 02:30:35,210
psychedelic because it,
you know,

2761
02:30:35,390 --> 02:30:39,110
no preparation needed.
You just bend over and pick the

2762
02:30:39,111 --> 02:30:41,750
mushroom.
They'll preparation is required,

2763
02:30:41,751 --> 02:30:46,751
which is probably why very ancient man
knew about psilocybin.

2764
02:30:47,670 --> 02:30:49,760
They couldn't.
They couldn't not have,

2765
02:30:49,790 --> 02:30:54,050
if they were living in an environment
where it was found.

2766
02:30:55,190 --> 02:30:56,150
That's amazing.
You know,

2767
02:30:56,151 --> 02:30:58,150
what's really incredible is that,
uh,

2768
02:30:58,280 --> 02:31:03,280
people are using suicide and these days
in what they call micro dosing,

2769
02:31:04,010 --> 02:31:07,550
taking very small doses and seeing these
profound benefits.

2770
02:31:07,840 --> 02:31:10,820
And uh,
one of the things that I'm aware of is

2771
02:31:10,821 --> 02:31:15,740
kickboxers are using it and kick boxers
are using it in a good buddy of mine is

2772
02:31:15,741 --> 02:31:18,200
using.
It says that he can see things happen

2773
02:31:18,201 --> 02:31:20,310
before they happen.
And like it was almost like he's reading

2774
02:31:20,310 --> 02:31:24,940
people's minds before they're about to
do something even on micro toast.

2775
02:31:24,970 --> 02:31:27,990
Yeah.
That's very interesting in the intense

2776
02:31:27,991 --> 02:31:30,270
environment of sparring and,
and the,

2777
02:31:30,271 --> 02:31:34,110
the intense physical Connecticut
interaction of kickboxing is that he's

2778
02:31:34,111 --> 02:31:36,480
seeing what people are going to do
before they do it in a way that he's

2779
02:31:36,481 --> 02:31:39,240
never able to do quote unquote on the
notch.

2780
02:31:39,780 --> 02:31:40,620
Right.
No,

2781
02:31:40,621 --> 02:31:42,330
I'm not surprised at all.
I mean,

2782
02:31:42,340 --> 02:31:44,130
and why?
Why aren't you surprised?

2783
02:31:44,131 --> 02:31:45,270
Like,
what do you think is happening?

2784
02:31:46,240 --> 02:31:49,240
Because I think that,
uh,

2785
02:31:49,241 --> 02:31:53,770
these things let you step out of your
box a little bit.

2786
02:31:53,800 --> 02:31:58,800
They let you step out of your usual
reference frame and notice things going

2787
02:31:58,811 --> 02:32:02,770
on in the environment that again,
this gating mechanism you were talking

2788
02:32:02,771 --> 02:32:05,050
about,
we're programmed to filter stuff out.

2789
02:32:05,560 --> 02:32:10,560
Psychedelics temporarily disrupt that.
They let the background come forward and

2790
02:32:10,871 --> 02:32:14,110
you notice things about the environment
that we're,

2791
02:32:14,250 --> 02:32:18,550
that normally you would suppress because
they're not relevant to immediate

2792
02:32:18,670 --> 02:32:22,480
survival.
I don't know if you've read some of the

2793
02:32:22,481 --> 02:32:26,470
work by Simon Powell.
He wrote the silicide been the solution.

2794
02:32:26,530 --> 02:32:29,500
He writes very intelligently about
psilocybin.

2795
02:32:30,430 --> 02:32:33,430
In this latest book,
the Magic Mushroom Explorer,

2796
02:32:33,431 --> 02:32:38,431
he talks about how psilocybin is a lens.
Essentially you can think of it as a

2797
02:32:41,021 --> 02:32:46,021
lens through which you can look at the
world.

2798
02:32:46,151 --> 02:32:51,151
You can look at natural phenomena and
you will notice things about that,

2799
02:32:51,640 --> 02:32:55,180
those phenomena that you normally
wouldn't overlook because we're

2800
02:32:55,181 --> 02:32:56,140
programmed to do it.

2801
02:32:56,140 --> 02:32:59,500
So in a sense,
he talks about how silicide but is a

2802
02:32:59,501 --> 02:33:01,270
scientific instrument.
You know,

2803
02:33:01,300 --> 02:33:05,590
it's a lens through which you can look
at the world and see aspects of it that

2804
02:33:05,591 --> 02:33:08,800
are always there,
but you've never noticed them before

2805
02:33:08,801 --> 02:33:11,350
because we're programmed not to.
For example,

2806
02:33:11,810 --> 02:33:13,270
um,
you know,

2807
02:33:13,300 --> 02:33:18,250
Kary Mullis is famous because his
discoveries in molecular biology,

2808
02:33:18,251 --> 02:33:23,251
he attributes to his insights about
molecular processes that he got from lsd

2809
02:33:25,600 --> 02:33:29,800
that he could get down with the
molecules as he put it and see how all

2810
02:33:29,801 --> 02:33:34,460
this is working.
And obviously he invented a preliminary

2811
02:33:34,570 --> 02:33:37,050
chain reaction which she got the Nobel
prize for.

2812
02:33:37,660 --> 02:33:42,310
So it's not like this is a delusion.
It's a real thing that he was able to

2813
02:33:42,311 --> 02:33:44,920
notice that no one else,
you know what I'm saying?

2814
02:33:44,921 --> 02:33:49,270
He was able to put himself in a place
where he could notice these phenomenon.

2815
02:33:49,360 --> 02:33:51,880
And I think,
I think that's really true.

2816
02:33:51,880 --> 02:33:56,200
If you,
if you go to take a walk in the forest

2817
02:33:56,201 --> 02:33:58,370
with an indigenous person,
you know,

2818
02:33:58,390 --> 02:34:03,390
who in some ways as in this less of this
sensory gating in a more open place all

2819
02:34:05,981 --> 02:34:09,310
the time.
They will notice things about the

2820
02:34:09,311 --> 02:34:10,990
environment,
you know,

2821
02:34:11,110 --> 02:34:16,110
that you are completely oblivious to
until they pointed out,

2822
02:34:16,720 --> 02:34:17,830
you know.
And then they'll say,

2823
02:34:17,831 --> 02:34:20,980
Oh yes,
I never noticed the leaf cutter ants are

2824
02:34:20,981 --> 02:34:23,710
behaving this way or these different
things.

2825
02:34:24,550 --> 02:34:29,550
Their sensory,
a sort of experience of a environment

2826
02:34:30,490 --> 02:34:35,490
like the forest is very different than
ours because we're used to.

2827
02:34:36,340 --> 02:34:38,920
We're just not out in nature the same
way.

2828
02:34:38,921 --> 02:34:43,921
And I daresay I think one of the things
that in some ways inserts a barrier

2829
02:34:45,551 --> 02:34:48,370
between us is literacy.
You know,

2830
02:34:48,400 --> 02:34:50,170
we're all literate,
right?

2831
02:34:50,260 --> 02:34:53,620
And we like being literate.
It's good that we're literate,

2832
02:34:54,310 --> 02:34:58,390
but in order to be literate,
you have to have this separation between

2833
02:34:58,391 --> 02:35:01,300
the self and the external environment.

2834
02:35:01,300 --> 02:35:04,330
You know,
you have to pick up a book and read it.

2835
02:35:04,690 --> 02:35:06,610
I am here.
I'm the point of view.

2836
02:35:06,611 --> 02:35:08,470
Here's the book,
you know,

2837
02:35:08,500 --> 02:35:13,500
so that creates that relationship and
you sacrifice,

2838
02:35:14,650 --> 02:35:19,650
you focus on one particular sensory
modality and you sacrifice all the other

2839
02:35:20,081 --> 02:35:24,640
input that is coming up.
I don't know if I'm making say no,

2840
02:35:24,641 --> 02:35:26,080
you absolutely are.
You absolutely are.

2841
02:35:26,110 --> 02:35:27,280
But,
but that's,

2842
02:35:27,370 --> 02:35:32,370
that's what these substances can do.
They can essentially reverse this

2843
02:35:34,130 --> 02:35:39,130
background foreground relationship that
we're so used to suddenly what's right

2844
02:35:40,211 --> 02:35:44,980
in front of you is not so important and
you can pay attention to the things in

2845
02:35:44,981 --> 02:35:49,240
the background that you're normally your
program to suppress and ignore because,

2846
02:35:49,750 --> 02:35:52,390
you know,
you have to be ready for the saber tooth

2847
02:35:52,420 --> 02:35:54,260
tiger to come across,
you know,

2848
02:35:54,280 --> 02:35:57,550
over the,
the mountain or whatever,

2849
02:35:57,850 --> 02:35:59,020
you know what I'm saying.
But,

2850
02:35:59,980 --> 02:36:03,370
uh,
it's good in that sense.

2851
02:36:03,400 --> 02:36:07,570
They teach different ways of perception,
you know,

2852
02:36:07,630 --> 02:36:10,210
and I think that's a very useful thing
to learn.

2853
02:36:10,600 --> 02:36:13,030
You know,
indigenous people call these

2854
02:36:13,031 --> 02:36:16,930
psychedelics plant teachers and they
call them teachers for a reason.

2855
02:36:17,910 --> 02:36:19,780
You know,
much of the,

2856
02:36:20,740 --> 02:36:24,040
what you experienced comes directly from
the experience.

2857
02:36:24,041 --> 02:36:28,240
But much of it also comes from your
change perception.

2858
02:36:28,241 --> 02:36:31,570
And suddenly you realize there's a
different way to be in the world.

2859
02:36:31,600 --> 02:36:36,600
There's a different way to perceive what
you experienced that normally you don't.

2860
02:36:39,190 --> 02:36:40,090
Uh,
you know,

2861
02:36:40,210 --> 02:36:45,210
we're programmed to filter out.
I don't know if you've ever read or had

2862
02:36:45,710 --> 02:36:48,340
Stephen Buhner on your show.
No.

2863
02:36:48,760 --> 02:36:51,460
He writes very intelligently about this
stuff.

2864
02:36:51,461 --> 02:36:55,960
He's written a book called a plant
intelligence on the imaginal realm,

2865
02:36:56,800 --> 02:37:00,010
and it's all about this,
you know,

2866
02:37:00,610 --> 02:37:01,443
this,
uh,

2867
02:37:02,650 --> 02:37:07,270
essentially let his rap is you can learn
this,

2868
02:37:07,300 --> 02:37:09,550
you know,
you can learn this way of perceiving

2869
02:37:09,580 --> 02:37:11,560
whether you do it with psychedelics or
not.

2870
02:37:11,640 --> 02:37:16,310
You can actually learn it and it's a,
it's an interesting.

2871
02:37:16,730 --> 02:37:21,730
It's a better way to relate to nature or
more an alternative way to relate to the

2872
02:37:22,030 --> 02:37:26,330
insured in any way.
I feel like we have these pre assumed

2873
02:37:26,350 --> 02:37:30,050
definitions of things that we rely upon
instead of seeing things for what they

2874
02:37:30,051 --> 02:37:31,870
really are.
And you,

2875
02:37:32,080 --> 02:37:33,320
you Kinda,
yeah.

2876
02:37:33,321 --> 02:37:35,630
You box them up and you package them and
you go,

2877
02:37:35,660 --> 02:37:37,220
oh,
well there's a car,

2878
02:37:37,380 --> 02:37:39,530
there is a.
and then one day you look at the car and

2879
02:37:39,531 --> 02:37:43,430
you go,
that's a box that has a controlled

2880
02:37:43,431 --> 02:37:48,431
explosion in cased in iron and that
rules on rubber tires and see exactly

2881
02:37:48,621 --> 02:37:51,590
what they're talking about.
There's a different way to look at

2882
02:37:51,591 --> 02:37:54,690
things if you step out of the box.
And yes,

2883
02:37:54,691 --> 02:37:59,240
it is all those things and it's also a
car and it's good if you did that all

2884
02:37:59,241 --> 02:38:00,560
the time,
you'd never get anything done.

2885
02:38:00,650 --> 02:38:03,170
That's right.
That's right.

2886
02:38:03,290 --> 02:38:05,480
But I mean it's interesting in that
respect,

2887
02:38:05,481 --> 02:38:08,030
you know,
with psychedelics,

2888
02:38:09,560 --> 02:38:13,090
because we're verbal people and we're,
you know,

2889
02:38:13,120 --> 02:38:17,150
were inhabited,
inhabited world of language as much as

2890
02:38:17,151 --> 02:38:22,151
the physical world and we're almost
compelled to try to put some kind of

2891
02:38:23,810 --> 02:38:28,810
linguistic wrapper over everything.
And which is one reason why if you smoke

2892
02:38:30,081 --> 02:38:31,340
DMT,
right,

2893
02:38:31,341 --> 02:38:34,910
you have a complete revelation.
It's amazing.

2894
02:38:34,911 --> 02:38:39,911
That's all of these things.
But it's in most cases you aren't even

2895
02:38:42,200 --> 02:38:47,200
down yet before you're trying to explain
it to yourself.

2896
02:38:47,390 --> 02:38:50,060
You know,
you're trying to stuff this thing in a

2897
02:38:50,061 --> 02:38:55,061
box because it was so impactful.
It's inherently in the EFL bowl.

2898
02:38:55,790 --> 02:38:58,130
You know,
you can't really describe it in

2899
02:38:58,131 --> 02:39:03,131
language,
but boy is there a desire to somehow

2900
02:39:03,950 --> 02:39:07,520
tame this thing which is
incomprehensible,

2901
02:39:07,521 --> 02:39:11,540
totally transcendent.
But that doesn't stop you from rapping

2902
02:39:11,541 --> 02:39:16,541
about it immediately to try to stuff it
into a box because it's too impactful.

2903
02:39:18,140 --> 02:39:20,870
And so on the individual level,
this is what people do.

2904
02:39:20,871 --> 02:39:23,590
Well,
that's what religions do too,

2905
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,780
right?
They try to take something like this and

2906
02:39:26,781 --> 02:39:29,720
stuff it into a box because in and of
itself,

2907
02:39:30,080 --> 02:39:33,200
without that wrapping or that
linguistic,

2908
02:39:33,850 --> 02:39:38,750
you know,
filters to somehow tame it and,

2909
02:39:39,470 --> 02:39:40,790
you know,
nullify,

2910
02:39:40,791 --> 02:39:44,240
neutralize its power.
These things are very dangerous.

2911
02:39:44,490 --> 02:39:46,400
There are,
there also seems to be some sort of a

2912
02:39:46,401 --> 02:39:49,550
physiological component to the,
uh,

2913
02:39:49,551 --> 02:39:54,551
the DMT trip where once it's over,
you have a very limited amount of time

2914
02:39:55,190 --> 02:39:57,740
to hang onto those memories.
Yes.

2915
02:39:57,770 --> 02:39:58,760
Well,
exactly.

2916
02:39:59,060 --> 02:40:04,060
So this is an attempt to entrain that,
to grab it and I think put a linguistic,

2917
02:40:05,080 --> 02:40:06,230
uh,
you know,

2918
02:40:06,560 --> 02:40:11,560
tag on a certain way so that as a way to
not forget it or,

2919
02:40:12,460 --> 02:40:14,150
or try and,
you know,

2920
02:40:14,250 --> 02:40:18,420
both reduce its power but give you
something to hang on because right.

2921
02:40:18,960 --> 02:40:22,800
The memory and flooded actually is it's
going to fade very rapidly.

2922
02:40:22,801 --> 02:40:24,000
Why is that?
What is,

2923
02:40:24,090 --> 02:40:27,870
what's the physiological.
I don't know what the physiological.

2924
02:40:27,871 --> 02:40:30,690
It's like a lot like dreams,
dreams.

2925
02:40:30,780 --> 02:40:33,510
It's a lot like dreams.
I think that it's just,

2926
02:40:34,770 --> 02:40:36,210
I don't know,
it's a,

2927
02:40:36,900 --> 02:40:41,900
it's something like that you could
probably train yourself to remember it

2928
02:40:42,090 --> 02:40:44,430
better,
just like people can train themselves to

2929
02:40:44,431 --> 02:40:46,870
remember their dreams.
Uh,

2930
02:40:47,040 --> 02:40:49,160
but it,
it's ephemeral,

2931
02:40:49,260 --> 02:40:51,930
you know,
it does tend to evaporate,

2932
02:40:51,960 --> 02:40:56,310
you know,
which is why it's important to go to the

2933
02:40:56,311 --> 02:40:59,150
well once in a file and take a drink.
Right.

2934
02:40:59,370 --> 02:41:02,760
I am not one of these people that says,
once you get the message,

2935
02:41:02,761 --> 02:41:06,750
hang up the phone,
that's a model that doesn't work for me.

2936
02:41:06,751 --> 02:41:08,760
Actually,
it might work for some people,

2937
02:41:08,761 --> 02:41:12,600
but I feel like this is not,
this is not an answering machine,

2938
02:41:12,630 --> 02:41:13,800
this is a teacher.

2939
02:41:13,800 --> 02:41:18,150
This is something that is intelligent
that you have a dialogue with,

2940
02:41:18,630 --> 02:41:20,190
you know,
and you don't,

2941
02:41:20,530 --> 02:41:22,830
you know,
teacher teaches a lesson.

2942
02:41:22,831 --> 02:41:24,270
You don't say,
thanks very much.

2943
02:41:24,750 --> 02:41:25,680
We're done.
Now.

2944
02:41:25,920 --> 02:41:30,920
It's an ongoing process.
I've been taking psychedelics for most

2945
02:41:30,931 --> 02:41:32,580
of my life,
a good part of my life.

2946
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:36,570
I feel like I've only learned a fraction
of what they have to teach me,

2947
02:41:37,110 --> 02:41:37,943
you know?
Um,

2948
02:41:37,950 --> 02:41:41,760
maybe I'm just dumb.
Maybe I don't get the message as well as

2949
02:41:41,761 --> 02:41:43,500
other people,
but I don't think so.

2950
02:41:43,501 --> 02:41:47,400
I think there's a lot.
They're full of surprises.

2951
02:41:47,401 --> 02:41:48,980
You know,
I've taken Iowaska,

2952
02:41:50,100 --> 02:41:53,160
Lux,
lost track a long time ago,

2953
02:41:53,161 --> 02:41:57,540
but probably 500 times or more and
people say,

2954
02:41:57,541 --> 02:41:58,350
well,
you know,

2955
02:41:58,350 --> 02:42:01,110
surely you've learned everything there
is to learn.

2956
02:42:01,680 --> 02:42:03,360
Actually No.
You know,

2957
02:42:03,420 --> 02:42:08,420
I always learned something new
and I learned certain basic things to

2958
02:42:09,691 --> 02:42:11,360
that.
It always reminds me about,

2959
02:42:11,700 --> 02:42:16,700
well also remember that you don't know
any chief and you're also acquiring new

2960
02:42:18,391 --> 02:42:22,050
data constantly in the natural world
that needs to be processed and sometimes

2961
02:42:22,410 --> 02:42:26,300
you process it with the tools of
civilization versus.

2962
02:42:26,420 --> 02:42:28,110
Yeah.
Versus the psychedelics.

2963
02:42:29,610 --> 02:42:31,080
It's A.
Well,

2964
02:42:31,081 --> 02:42:32,730
you know,
it's just interesting.

2965
02:42:32,800 --> 02:42:34,880
Yeah,
it keeps me off the streets.

2966
02:42:39,130 --> 02:42:42,010
A lot of people can be great.
Yeah.

2967
02:42:42,780 --> 02:42:44,100
No,
I'm grateful.

2968
02:42:44,160 --> 02:42:45,210
I'm grateful.
Listen,

2969
02:42:45,610 --> 02:42:48,300
I think I've taken up plenty of your
time here and this is an amazing

2970
02:42:48,301 --> 02:42:49,920
conversation.
I really appreciate it.

2971
02:42:49,930 --> 02:42:50,530
Uh,
I,

2972
02:42:50,530 --> 02:42:54,030
I'm always happy when we can do this.
I wish we could do it more often.

2973
02:42:54,480 --> 02:42:56,220
We should do it.
We definitely should.

2974
02:42:56,221 --> 02:42:59,250
Let's do it.
I can come,

2975
02:42:59,280 --> 02:43:00,240
um,
you know,

2976
02:43:00,241 --> 02:43:04,800
there are many people I can recommend.
I'm sure you'd get hundreds of requests,

2977
02:43:04,830 --> 02:43:07,590
but certain people you ought to be
talking to you.

2978
02:43:07,591 --> 02:43:09,180
Let's do it.
Let's do it.

2979
02:43:09,300 --> 02:43:12,040
So please one more time.
Tell people about

2980
02:43:12,040 --> 02:43:15,850
this conference and um,
when they can watch it on facebook.

2981
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,200
Okay,
well it's the e,

2982
02:43:18,201 --> 02:43:18,831
s,
p,

2983
02:43:18,831 --> 02:43:20,740
e d [inaudible] dot com.
That's,

2984
02:43:20,770 --> 02:43:22,960
that's the key thing.
Esp d 50.

2985
02:43:23,320 --> 02:43:28,320
The conference will be June sixth,
seventh and the eighth in the UK.

2986
02:43:28,960 --> 02:43:31,330
You can go there if you want to attend
it.

2987
02:43:31,390 --> 02:43:35,350
The cost is high to actually go there
and do it,

2988
02:43:35,890 --> 02:43:39,580
but people could access it on facebook
and if you go to that website then

2989
02:43:39,581 --> 02:43:43,720
there's a link through to the facebook
page and we'll be live streaming it,

2990
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:44,950
you know,
on the sixth,

2991
02:43:45,070 --> 02:43:48,910
the sixth,
seventh and eighth of June at.

2992
02:43:48,911 --> 02:43:51,700
It'll be archived.
So I don't expect people in the states

2993
02:43:51,701 --> 02:43:53,490
to get up at three in the morning,
you know,

2994
02:43:53,530 --> 02:43:55,150
to watch it.
Although they could,

2995
02:43:55,151 --> 02:43:57,310
if they want to watch it live,
but it'll all be,

2996
02:43:57,810 --> 02:43:59,560
you know,
archives.

2997
02:43:59,561 --> 02:44:03,490
So they can look at it at any time and
will you transfer it over to other more

2998
02:44:03,491 --> 02:44:06,460
accessible that people that don't have
facebook maybe on youtube or something

2999
02:44:06,461 --> 02:44:07,630
along those lines of Vimeo?

3000
02:44:08,560 --> 02:44:11,440
Eventually.
We haven't made plans to live stream it

3001
02:44:11,441 --> 02:44:13,770
on vimeo.
I don't know how you do that.

3002
02:44:13,780 --> 02:44:16,510
I think you can live stream it,
but you could definitely take the video

3003
02:44:16,511 --> 02:44:18,760
recording.
Perhaps if you have a physical

3004
02:44:18,780 --> 02:44:19,630
recording,
it'll.

3005
02:44:19,631 --> 02:44:23,530
It'll all be up there eventually,
but just live stream real time.

3006
02:44:23,531 --> 02:44:28,531
Facebook will be where we do it mostly
because everyone has told me this is how

3007
02:44:28,841 --> 02:44:29,674
you do.
Okay,

3008
02:44:29,790 --> 02:44:33,010
well I will definitely tweet that out to
everybody and I'll let everybody know

3009
02:44:33,011 --> 02:44:36,010
and I'll put it on all the available
social media.

3010
02:44:36,190 --> 02:44:38,890
Fantastic pages and and ordered the
book.

3011
02:44:38,930 --> 02:44:43,120
You can go to the website and order the
book and the book will come out probably

3012
02:44:43,121 --> 02:44:48,040
the end of November and it's going to
take a few months for everybody to get

3013
02:44:48,041 --> 02:44:48,910
there.
You know,

3014
02:44:48,911 --> 02:44:51,760
they have to not only make a
presentation,

3015
02:44:51,761 --> 02:44:54,910
they have to submit a paper for this
book and I'm,

3016
02:44:55,090 --> 02:44:58,150
you know,
I'm dangling a certain rewards out to

3017
02:44:58,151 --> 02:45:03,151
them to make sure that they do in fact
submit a full paper in the spirit of the

3018
02:45:03,221 --> 02:45:07,120
first conference,
but it's going to be an amazing book and

3019
02:45:07,121 --> 02:45:11,260
it's something I've wanted to do for a
long time and uh,

3020
02:45:11,320 --> 02:45:14,870
I can check this off the list now and go
onto something else.

3021
02:45:15,490 --> 02:45:17,010
Beautiful.
I hope they do it more.

3022
02:45:17,080 --> 02:45:18,290
Thanks Joe.
Thank you,

3023
02:45:18,300 --> 02:45:19,750
Dennis.
I appreciate you very,

3024
02:45:19,751 --> 02:45:20,620
very much.
All right.

3025
02:45:20,621 --> 02:45:22,000
Thanks folks.
See you soon.

3026
02:45:22,001 --> 02:45:23,090
Bye.
Bye.

3027
02:45:23,110 --> 02:45:23,380
Bye.
