1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,190
Five four, three, two,

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,040
one boom.

3
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:11,460
And we're live with my friend Justin
wren in the house and one of the baddest

4
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:14,940
motherfuckers on the planet.
Rafael Lovato. Absolutely. Dude,

5
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:17,490
I'm bummed that you're,
I'm happy that you're doing well,

6
00:00:17,491 --> 00:00:21,450
but I'm bombing you fighting for Bella
tour. Oh, I really am, man. I want wanna.

7
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:22,530
I want to come and take your fights.

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:27,690
I know for a fact that Bella
tour right now is like, is high.

9
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:30,570
It's a higher level than it's ever been
before. Right? I mean, you look at,

10
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:35,310
they've got Moose Saucy,
you, Rory Macdonald, uh,

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,660
Lima, uh, you know Paul
Daley Machida. I mean,

12
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:41,640
it's fucking high level now,
man.

13
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,530
It's like Bella tour is very
close to comparable still.

14
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,850
I would love to see you over [inaudible]
yeah, well we'll see what happens,

15
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:53,700
but right now I'm really happy
where I'm at. How old are you now?

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,880
I'm 35 and you didn't start MMA until
you were like 31 32 31 house for four

17
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:01,920
years ago. Yeah, 2014 was my first fight.

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,480
Were you doing a lot of MMA training
before that? Because when you're,

19
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,160
you were for people that don't know,

20
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:10,860
you're one of the most
accomplished Brazilian Jiu
Jitsu black belts in the world.

21
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,330
And when you're competing as a
Brazilian Jujitsu martial artist,

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,400
were you training striking when you
training other things as well? Well,

23
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,420
uh, you know, that's a kind of my
life story I guess. Um, you know,

24
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:29,770
my father is a lifetime martial artist
and so I had a whole martial arts upgrade

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,290
upbringing. Well before I ever
found out about Brazilian Jujitsu.

26
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:39,210
My father was a g condo instructor.
And so growing up, um, you know,

27
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:42,900
the main thing that we were training
at when I was a child was, uh,

28
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:44,070
the g condo system,

29
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,020
which was basically mixed martial arts
before mixed martial arts. You know,

30
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:53,040
Bruce Lee's philosophy was way ahead of
his time. He believed in, uh, you know,

31
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:57,990
learning from all the arts and creating
your own personal system of self defense,

32
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,210
um, that involves, you know,
each range of combat. And so,

33
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:08,270
you know, I grew up doing several
different forms of martial arts. Um, uh,

34
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,080
boxing moy, Thai Eskrima Wing
Chung Pin Joc, see lot, I mean,

35
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:14,640
you name it,
I've probably done it.

36
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,110
And when my father discovered
Brazilian Jujitsu, uh,

37
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,630
I was an early teenager,
like around 12 years old.

38
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,220
He learned about Brazilian Jujitsu in one
of the g Cuando instructor conferences

39
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:29,850
that takes place in California.
They brought in the Gracies. Um,

40
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,740
they had, you know, they did
like shootfighting fighting
and different sort of,

41
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,630
you know, martial arts and that
included grappling. Uh, but it was very,

42
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,471
you know,

43
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:45,420
rough and not near the technique
that Brazilians you two has a,

44
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:49,050
so whenever he first started
learning Brazilian Jujitsu,
he fell in love with it.

45
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,940
My Dad's a smaller guy, uh, at that time
he was probably like 140 550 pounds.

46
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,920
And so it was perfect for him and he fell
in love with it and he comes home and

47
00:02:58,921 --> 00:03:02,840
he telling me about Brazilian Jujitsu
and teaching me what he learned. Um,

48
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,120
and we lived in Oklahoma and then start
to conference was in California at that

49
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:11,650
time. Basically the only Jujitsu was in
California, maybe a little bit in Florida.

50
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:12,850
And then Henson was in New York.

51
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:16,480
So everything was as far as possible from
us because we were right there in the

52
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:20,320
middle of the country. And you know, he
fell in love with Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

53
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:24,310
And so he started making trips to
California to learn Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

54
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:29,240
And I was just a teenager. I'm a young
kid, so, you know, I was already, uh,

55
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,670
doing some boxing at the time, uh, as
competing in amateur boxing. And I'm,

56
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,110
I'm used to training with adults and once
I started learning Brazilian Jujitsu,

57
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,880
you know,

58
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,860
I fell in love with it right away because
that gave me something that I could do

59
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:45,640
where I could be competitive
with the adults right away.
You know, it was a long,

60
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:48,910
lanky kid. Um, and the
guards just, you know,

61
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:52,120
felt natural to me and just being
on the ground. I really loved it.

62
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:54,800
And I love that the,
the technique of Brazilian Jujitsu,

63
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,930
how technical it was and
the science of it. Um,

64
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,790
so I fell in love with it
right away and I mean, uh, we,

65
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:07,600
we sacrificed a lot to learn
Jujitsu. Being an Oklahoma, um,

66
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,580
always traveled, uh, to learn. The first
time I went to Brazil, I was 16 years old.

67
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:17,530
It was in 1999, uh, to, to train and
compete in the world championships.

68
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,870
And, you know, we just never stopped.

69
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,200
And we became the first American father
and son, Brazilian Jujitsu, black belts.

70
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,590
Uh, but you know, going
back to your question,

71
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,990
the full spectrum of martial arts
was always in my blood. Um, you know,

72
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:35,470
even as a Jujitsu competitor,
you know,

73
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,760
someone that found his passion in Jujitsu,

74
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,770
I still considered myself a martial
artist first and foremost, not just, uh,

75
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,630
a Jujitsu practitioner. And so it was
always in the plans to one day do MMA.

76
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,670
Um, but I really wanted to go as far
as I could. And in Brazilian Jujitsu.

77
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,891
You know,

78
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:55,810
I was there when Bj Penn won the world
championships in 2000 and I watched him

79
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:56,860
win. And I said, you know, man,

80
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:59,200
I really want to be the next
American to to win the worlds.

81
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:04,030
That immediately became like my, my
big life goal, my first life goal. And,

82
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:08,410
um, and I achieved that in
2007. But, you know, like,

83
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:12,850
we all saw Bj go to MMA after he won.
He never even did another tournament.

84
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:15,010
You know, that was the only tournament
he ever did as a black belt.

85
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:18,640
What's the worlds and he won and then,
and then switch to MMA.

86
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:22,260
And so I really want it to
be an American, you know, um,

87
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,510
just kind of representing
for us in Brazilian Jujitsu,

88
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,670
I'm competing at that high level and
winning as much as possible and kind of,

89
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:34,990
you know, at that time it
wasn't like today the world's,
we're still in Brazil. Uh,

90
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:39,010
uh, the sport was just dominated by
Brazilians and pretty much still is today.

91
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:40,110
But you know,
now we've,

92
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:45,111
we've come a long way and I just want
it to be that forced to show everyone

93
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,300
like, hey, we can do it. You know what I
mean? We're, uh, you know, it's possible,

94
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,620
you know, because at that time it was,
it was a whole nother scene. You know,

95
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:56,590
the world's in Brazil at the end of the,
at the tournament,

96
00:05:56,591 --> 00:06:00,440
you're lucky if you had a handful
of nob resilience on the podium,

97
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:04,280
had all the belts, you know,
including blue, purple,
Brown, I mean, all the belts,

98
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,300
let alone black belt.

99
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,390
And so I stayed in the sport to
really try to get a second goal.

100
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,330
That was the main thing
that was keeping me in it,

101
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,940
to win a second goal that the
world's has a black belt. Uh,

102
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:19,430
I ended up medaling eight times,
never got that second gold. But, uh,

103
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,880
towards the end I was just like, you
know, it's time to switch. You know,

104
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:26,180
I really felt like, um,
in the Mei was calling me,

105
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:30,380
Jiu Jitsu was getting a little
too comfortable. Um, you know,

106
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:33,020
and I had been fighting too comfortable.
Yeah.

107
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:37,310
Like it wasn't motivating me and inspired
me the same way that it was in the

108
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,340
beginning. You know, it kind of lost
a little bit of that hunger, uh,

109
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:43,670
just because I had been at the, the
that level for so long and I've already,

110
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,920
you know, competed against the best guys
in my generation so many times. And,

111
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,730
uh, you know, it didn't take a
lot for me to get ready. You know,

112
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:55,600
I was kind of just used to it,
you know,

113
00:06:55,601 --> 00:06:59,510
it's the same tournaments the same season,
year after year, and it was just, yeah,

114
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:01,290
same guys.
Uh,

115
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:05,570
it just stopped bringing out the fire now
every now and then I felt it, you know,

116
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:08,960
especially when I went back to
compete in Brazil, uh, you know,

117
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,770
the world's switch to the u s and
in 2007 the year that I want it.

118
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,600
And so I,
I stopped having that thing to,

119
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,200
to push me to go to Brazil to compete.
Um,

120
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,250
and so I went back a couple of times to
compete in the Brazilian nationals and I

121
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:23,690
had really good performances there.

122
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,850
I ended up winning the absolute
in 2013 in Brazil. Uh, the,

123
00:07:27,851 --> 00:07:30,470
the all way class division,
uh,

124
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,100
became the first non Brazilian to
ever win a major absolute title.

125
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:38,110
And I did an in Brazil, that was a day
I was extremely inspired, you know, uh,

126
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,800
competing in Brazil
brought that out of me,

127
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:44,180
but I just didn't feel that
way all the time, you know, uh,

128
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,870
just got too used to it. And so I just
felt like it was calling me, you know,

129
00:07:47,871 --> 00:07:49,220
I knew one day I was going to do it.

130
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,530
I had to have one fight
just as a martial artist.

131
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,290
I had to do at least one before
it was all said and done.

132
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,280
And I really just kind of took it
as a one fight basis, you know,

133
00:07:58,281 --> 00:08:03,200
like I knew I needed to do it once
and you know, uh, the time felt right.

134
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,640
Like, okay, let's, let's go, let's
switch back in, uh, to, you know,

135
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:11,870
kind of tapping into who I was as a
martial artist though the training that I

136
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:14,330
had as a kid, as a child, um,

137
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:18,740
under my father under the
g condo system. And, um,

138
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,790
and I did one fight and
I enjoyed it and I said,

139
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:26,070
I got to do more and I've got to do
at least one more the whole time.

140
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:27,190
When you were doing Jujitsu,

141
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,100
where you training kickboxing at all when
you're doing any wrestling? Like, well,

142
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:36,010
always, uh, did wrestling, you know, to
supplement, supplement, Brazilian Jujitsu,

143
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,620
the Gnocchi, competitions, ADCC,
things like that. Um, you know,

144
00:08:39,621 --> 00:08:43,440
and I just believed in training
everything to judo as well. Um,

145
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,730
like what about practicing ground and
pound and all the other things in MMA?

146
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,550
Well, whenever I was
younger, uh, my father,

147
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:54,551
he had some fighters that he was training
and so I trained a lot with them.

148
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,420
And then whenever I took over the academy,
um,

149
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,360
we had a couple guys that were
fighting then as well, uh,

150
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:04,590
one of which went to the UFC. And so
I was sparring with these guys, um,

151
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,160
helping them get ready.
And in 2008,

152
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,300
I met who is now my main MMA coach.

153
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,730
He's my Moy Thai instructor. Uh,
his name is Mauricio Amado. Uh,

154
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,640
his nickname is Vail. He, his
brothers of Andre Dda. Um,

155
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,260
and they are both shoot box. Is
that what you were encouraged? Tiva?

156
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,580
You've done camps? Yes, exactly.

157
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:31,580
That's where DDA lifts his brother
and a DDS to fight in pride. Uh,

158
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,350
k one A. I think he did. Yeah. K One. Um,

159
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,020
he did a dream. I believe he
did some Emily as well. Uh,

160
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,860
but he's more of a of a
kickboxing. Yeah. Striker. Um,

161
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,620
and I, I met Matty Uco and, uh, I,

162
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:53,630
I really fell in love with his style of
Muay Thai and I had some guys fighting

163
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:58,040
at that time. What's the difference
in his style? Well, it's,

164
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:01,770
it's totally designed
for MMA. Um, you know,

165
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:05,010
it's not Moitai for Moitai, you know, uh,

166
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,110
they call it their system evolution.
Sound time basically means evolution,

167
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:10,890
you know,

168
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,690
and it's evolved into this system
that is designed for MMA. You know,

169
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:18,120
you're, you're not just
turning, striking for striking,

170
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:22,830
you're doing striking to set up
takedowns or defend take downs and,

171
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,980
um, it was just a, you know,
an incredible system. Justin,

172
00:10:25,981 --> 00:10:30,410
whenever we fought last year, he got
to train with mighty UCO, um, and,

173
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,000
and experience it for himself and special.
Yeah.

174
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:37,530
And Maddie's steel himself is just
an amazing martial artist. Uh,

175
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,340
you know, the, the, the passion that he
has is you can't get them to stop. Yeah.

176
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:46,020
Will you train with a lot of guys? Like
what was different for you? I mean,

177
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,280
I think the way that they,

178
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:52,370
they move and see the punches coming in
and the blocks are different and the,

179
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,850
the movement, I mean, just so much
movement, movement, movement, um,

180
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,780
and then highlight silo to compensate
for the fact that you're using smaller

181
00:11:00,781 --> 00:11:04,890
gloves, like a different
way of protecting yourself.

182
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,490
How would you explain that
just, well, yeah, I mean the,

183
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,540
the offense and defense is
so intertwined. Um, you know,

184
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:17,190
you do everything on both
sides. Um, and it's all,

185
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:22,080
you know, very powerful as well.
It's designed for, uh, you know,

186
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,390
inflicting as much damage as possible.

187
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:29,520
And for me it was so good because they
can work with me as a Jiu Jitsu guy much

188
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:32,790
different because they don't have to worry
about someone trying to take me down,

189
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:36,150
you know, I can pretty much throw
whatever, whatever's possible,

190
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:40,110
everything in the kitchen sink and for
the most part you're happy if someone

191
00:11:40,111 --> 00:11:42,590
takes you down. Yeah.
That's okay. It's okay. And,

192
00:11:42,591 --> 00:11:46,720
and then also I have the threat being
able to threaten someone with a takedown,

193
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,420
which opens up a lot of striking
as well. And so the, the,

194
00:11:50,421 --> 00:11:52,560
the way they have this system design,
you know,

195
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:57,010
is just for me and Manny sue us a
person has just an incredible guy that I

196
00:11:57,011 --> 00:12:01,600
really fell in love with. And uh, honestly
if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be,

197
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,740
I wouldn't be doing MMA.

198
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:07,600
He just made me feel like I had the
right person in place, the family, um,

199
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,650
to, to go into it and made confidently
and, and enjoy it. You know what I mean?

200
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:14,050
Cause I, in the beginning I wasn't
sure how much I was going to,

201
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,240
how much I was going to
like the whole process.

202
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,220
You've been working with him
for what, 10 years? Yeah,

203
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:20,500
we've been training together 10 years.
Yes.

204
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,710
And so I was bringing him out
to help my guys get ready.

205
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:27,340
There were the guys that were fighting
MMA and at the same time always training

206
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:32,170
with him. It wasn't my focus then, but,
uh, I, I love to cross train, you know,

207
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:34,270
and just the movement,
you know,

208
00:12:34,271 --> 00:12:38,260
I love the movement and keeping my
body guessing, doing different things.

209
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:42,600
And um, and so when I decided,
okay, let's go all in on MMA,

210
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,550
he was the obvious person to call.
And since then he,

211
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,930
he basically spends half
the year in Oklahoma with me
and lives with me and I go

212
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:52,810
to Brazil to train with
DDA and his team there. Um,

213
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,000
what made you decide to
do that? Like, I mean,

214
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:59,760
that's a big commitment to try to go all
the way to Brazil for your camps. Well,

215
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,300
how many camps are you done now? Uh,
nine. Yeah, I've had nine fights.

216
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:08,430
Basically every fight. Um, well how
much time do you spend on that? Uh,

217
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,860
at least two weeks. Um,
sometimes a little more.

218
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,020
There's been a couple times a little less,
but right around two weeks.

219
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,990
This next time if you fight
a gay garden was saucy,

220
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,370
you might spend three or four weeks. Yeah,
I'm thinking probably a month, month. Um,

221
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,390
you know, it's just kind of full
circle for me, you know, like I said,

222
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:29,410
I went to Brazil first time, uh, 16
years old going to Rio to train Jujitsu,

223
00:13:29,411 --> 00:13:30,760
compete in the world championships.

224
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:33,430
Did your dad go down there with
you whenever you were 16. Actually,

225
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,990
my dad has never gone to Brazil. He, you
know, he's not a flyer. He doesn't fly.

226
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,770
He does not like to fly. When he was
going to California, he was driving,

227
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:47,440
driving glaucoma. Yup. 12 over 20 hours.
Drove to your last fight and the Boise,

228
00:13:47,441 --> 00:13:51,370
Idaho, that signers along the
way, three hours, he knows.

229
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,640
And he used to be in the air force
and that's kind of why he had a bad

230
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:58,120
experience for me. And
uh, he, he lived in Spain.

231
00:13:58,121 --> 00:14:01,000
He was stationed there when
he was in the air force. Um,

232
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,850
but you can get them to
fly. It's a bit of work. Uh,

233
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,700
it's going to take a little bit of a,

234
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:11,920
some drugs and maybe a drink or
two to come down. But, um, yeah,

235
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:15,400
he, he would, uh, W I mean we did
road trips on my spring break,

236
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:20,320
Christmas break from Oklahoma all the
way to California to train. Um, so he's,

237
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:23,920
he has not made a trip to Brazil yet,
but I think it's coming soon. He's, uh,

238
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,660
he took a long break from,
from, uh, from flying. And, uh,

239
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,500
in 2009, he had a heart
attack. Uh, unfortunately,

240
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:37,501
but he bounced back and since then he's
kind of reformatted his life a little

241
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:38,740
bit. And, uh,

242
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:43,120
and one of the things that he put
his mind to do coming back was the,

243
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,740
the, uh, the famous
walk, uh, in Spain. Uh,

244
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,920
got it left my mind right now. They
made a movie about it before. Um,

245
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:56,010
and that pushed him to two minutes walk.
Yeah. Well I had, I can't remember it.

246
00:14:56,011 --> 00:15:00,800
Right. Um, yeah. You know, where you
walk, like you walk to hike? Yes. Yes.

247
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:05,720
It's a long walk. I feel so bad that
I can't remember the name. Um, yeah,

248
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,640
it's like a six week walk and,
and you ended up at a special cathedral.

249
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,740
The Camino, the Camino
de Santiago. Yes. Uh,

250
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,050
in the Santiago is the Cathedral.
There it is, that picture of there.

251
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,180
So he did that. Um, and so he had, of
course, he had to fly to Spain to do it.

252
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:28,400
And so flying to Spain to
walk six week. Yes, yes.

253
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,570
They're specially trained
for it and you know, and he,

254
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,850
that was one of the maybe
train to walk six weeks it,

255
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,140
well you weren't a backpack.
And so every day he would backpack,

256
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,580
backpack through.
Um,

257
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,360
they have special hostels that you
would stay in on the walk. I mean,

258
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,880
there's a lot of people
that do it. Uh, you know,

259
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:48,080
you're not going to be by herself.

260
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,390
There's people doing it all
your mountain trail in Georgia.

261
00:15:50,391 --> 00:15:52,910
What is that called again?
Appalachian trail, you know,

262
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,380
it goes all the way up to Maine.

263
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:59,970
Had a friend that just did that six
months was so proud of him for doing that.

264
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:04,490
But, and so he started flying again. And
I think you'll be going to Brazil soon,

265
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,500
but you and your dad to me
or something really special,

266
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:09,440
like you embody the heart
of a true martial artist.

267
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,550
You live it as a lifestyle and for you
even in for him to be supporting you,

268
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:13,911
you know,

269
00:16:13,911 --> 00:16:18,070
you coming out of the wound basically
starting martial arts and then how he

270
00:16:18,071 --> 00:16:20,780
supporting you as a 16 year
old going down to Brazil.

271
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:25,060
And how long did you stay there whenever
you're 16 to weeks? Little over. Yeah,

272
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,230
I mean it, yeah. My, my, my
parents, both my parents, uh,

273
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,640
just have given me incredible
support. My mom, I mean,

274
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,920
my dad is a full on martial
artists mean, you know, uh, lived,

275
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:41,100
he follows his passion, his martial
artist, musician, he plays the Oregon, uh,

276
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,500
just a very unique individual.
Um, and, uh, you know,

277
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:48,980
he opened a martial arts school and my
mom given us incredible support and,

278
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:49,881
you know,

279
00:16:49,881 --> 00:16:54,650
I just basically followed his footsteps
and whenever I started to commit myself

280
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:59,580
to, you know, going all in, they've
always been behind me. And, um, I mean,

281
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,151
I,
I the,

282
00:17:00,151 --> 00:17:05,000
the timing of it is just very special
because he was inspired by Bruce Lee and

283
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:07,970
that's what pushed him to, you
know, fall that she can do a system.

284
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:13,110
And so I got to come in in that, uh,
which is a very, you know, unique, uh,

285
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,780
style.
When I was a child,

286
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,570
I was training with Danny and Maisano
Richard Steal some of the most incredible

287
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:20,270
martial artist that I've ever lived.
That's very fortunate.

288
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:23,120
And then I was at the special
age of a teenager, you know,

289
00:17:23,121 --> 00:17:27,470
when Brazilian just to first started
making its way to the u s and I had the

290
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:29,870
support of them say, yeah,
you're going to go to Brazil,

291
00:17:29,871 --> 00:17:33,650
you're going to compete in the world's.
And I got to see Jujitsu, you know,

292
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:34,990
very early on.
Uh,

293
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,670
the first world championships was
in [inaudible] 96 and I competed in

294
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:42,560
[inaudible] 99. And so I got to
experience Brazilian Jujitsu, uh,

295
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,020
almost its roots,
um,

296
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:49,350
in Brazil and see what it's
become today. Um, you know,

297
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:52,770
worldwide, such a big sport. And
now I'm also fighting in the May,

298
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,270
so it's really cool.

299
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,740
My whole martial arts genic shooter
box is known for some of the roughest

300
00:17:58,741 --> 00:18:02,100
sparring ever. And there was an
old school the way they, you do it.

301
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:06,990
Do they still spar like that? Because
it used to be just gym wars. I mean,

302
00:18:06,991 --> 00:18:10,020
and the, the criticism was
that a lot of these guys were,

303
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:14,220
they were damaging themselves so badly
and training that they were limiting

304
00:18:14,221 --> 00:18:18,770
their careers. Yeah, I would
say they learned from that. Um,

305
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:23,610
a little bit, a little bit, but, uh, it's,
it's definitely, it's definitely hardcore,

306
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,840
um, go down and could achieve. Uh,
and that's one of the reasons that it,

307
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,730
that I like it so much.
It gets me out of my comfort zone.

308
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,850
And you feel that energy every day,
you know,

309
00:18:32,851 --> 00:18:37,700
you wake up and you kind of
have to process what you're
about to go to, you know,

310
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,560
when the professional
training every morning. Um,

311
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,760
but how often did you spar down there?

312
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:48,090
There is some version of sparring almost
every day, basically every day. Um,

313
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,030
but it, it, it's a different
aspect. You might be boxing only.

314
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:55,470
There's a Moitai only day
there's a MMA sparring. There's,

315
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,210
you know, grappling with ground and
pound and wall wall work. You know, um,

316
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:00,830
it's,

317
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,810
it's interesting because there's so many
different philosophies when it comes to

318
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:07,560
how often you should spar.
There is, um, you know,

319
00:19:07,561 --> 00:19:10,020
and there are definitely days where
I have to kind of speak up and say,

320
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:13,260
you know what, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
pull back just a little bit today. Uh,

321
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,960
just depending on what my body feels,
a,

322
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:18,720
I try to listen to that
as much as possible. Um,

323
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,920
there aren't you sparring partners with
like Vander Lee down? They're still, yeah,

324
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,370
yeah. Fuck all that. Yeah. Actually this

325
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,840
spar Vandelay you just
fight him, right? Uh,

326
00:19:30,841 --> 00:19:35,820
this scar right here is happening, could
achieve with sparring, with Vandelay. Um,

327
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:40,740
you know, you, you get more comfortable
with it and the guys are awesome.

328
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:44,940
I mean the, they are definitely my MMA
family. That's just the way they do it.

329
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:48,120
It's not them, it's not a personal
thing. It's not trying to hurt you. No.

330
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:52,260
Not going to hurt each other. They sing
and dance and you know, hug and, you know,

331
00:19:52,261 --> 00:19:54,270
I mean, afterwards, everyone's so happy.

332
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,810
You make it through it and
you celebrate it. You know,

333
00:19:56,811 --> 00:19:58,980
it's the craziest story I heard was,
um,

334
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,600
shogun and Vandelay we're arguing
over the price of a pit bull puppy.

335
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,080
And so they decided to
fight and if Vandelay one,

336
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,190
then he would get the puppy for free.

337
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:15,570
And if shogun one vendor would have
to pay him what he wanted and Vandelay

338
00:20:15,571 --> 00:20:16,560
knocked shogun out.

339
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,060
I'm training and it was a laughing when
he woke them up holding the puppy. Wow.

340
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:24,150
Like what the fuck? Yeah. And they're
really good friends. Yep. Yeah.

341
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,720
It's a little different while somebody
needs to talk to them about traumatic

342
00:20:27,721 --> 00:20:30,750
brain injuries. Right. Yeah. I
think one of the things that they,

343
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:35,430
the worst things they were doing there,
they were sparring full on like day,

344
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,460
like two days a day before
the fight that was sparring.

345
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:44,070
Right. The day before they weigh
ends, they're sparring. So yeah,

346
00:20:44,071 --> 00:20:47,430
there's some really funny
cool stories. They, they have,

347
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,180
well I guess you get used to it.
So there's that, but you also,

348
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:56,500
you leave a lot of your Chin in,
in the gym, you know what I mean?

349
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,190
There's just only so much punishment
of body can take. Yeah. Don't,

350
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:04,360
don't take it wrong. I mean
that is controlled now, but yes.

351
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:09,220
But I would say it's still more hardcore
than the average place for sure. It's,

352
00:21:09,221 --> 00:21:10,630
I mean that's the,

353
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:15,750
it is so open in terms of how people
decide to structure their camps.

354
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,500
Some people have very little sparring.
Like cowboy was telling me,

355
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:21,940
he doesn't hear Harley's bars at all.

356
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,120
I mean he does just technical
work and pad work. He's like,

357
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:27,820
I already know how to fight. He wasn't
used to be completely the opposite though,

358
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:30,490
right? Yeah. I used to spar, spar,
spar, spar. I know switched it up,

359
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,340
but that's when he started
doing much better. He said,

360
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,300
he said it really made a big difference
because he was going into fights damaged

361
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,050
because you know he's such a,
he's so hardcore himself.

362
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,760
That sparring with him ultimately must
become more hardcore cause he's such a

363
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:48,850
fucking wild man.
Seller did something similar as a thing.

364
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:54,100
I think Tony Ferguson was just
no sparring. Yep. Tony had no,

365
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,450
no sparring in preparation
for his last fight. That's,

366
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,010
that's when I saw him in the post fight
interview and what makes sense about

367
00:22:00,011 --> 00:22:03,850
that with him though is that he was
coming off in in catastrophic knee injury.

368
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:08,020
I mean he literally tore his ligament
off the bone and had to have it put back

369
00:22:08,021 --> 00:22:11,710
on and then six months later he
was fighting. That's incredible.

370
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,610
This is not a whole lot of human beings
like that guy. Yeah. He's a real freak.

371
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,360
That level of grit determination to come
back from that injury and to perform

372
00:22:19,361 --> 00:22:22,990
like he did. Yeah. That was my
favorite fight of the night. Yeah.

373
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:26,700
I really enjoyed it. I was bummed out.
The pedes hurt his hand because it isn't,

374
00:22:26,701 --> 00:22:30,100
it hasn't stopped going forward. No,
he doesn't mean he never gets tired.

375
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,930
That's the crazy thing about Tony,

376
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,470
you know in Eddie Bravo does his camps
with him up in big bear and he says it's

377
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:39,180
nuts man. Every they do hill sprints,
everybody else is exhausted and,

378
00:22:39,181 --> 00:22:41,800
and Tony's just lapping
them this running back up.

379
00:22:41,801 --> 00:22:44,580
I mean he's just never added gas.
He,

380
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,140
he'll work out six hours hard a day.

381
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,650
And on top of that what
he does is he gets there,

382
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,740
they rent a house and then
he builds his own gym.

383
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,470
So they'll have like a
house that they rent.

384
00:22:56,471 --> 00:23:00,580
He'll Matt up the living room and then
he'll go outside. I'll put up a wing,

385
00:23:00,581 --> 00:23:03,820
Chung dummy, don't hang
heavy bags. He does it all.

386
00:23:03,821 --> 00:23:06,320
I'm so used to do the week
check. Wts Yeah, man mean he,

387
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,550
he actually use wing Chung
and the fight with Pettis,

388
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,130
he trapped his hand and
hit him with an elbow once.

389
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,800
And I remember watching it going like,
Holy Shit.

390
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:18,520
He just use wind chunk inside
the cage. Like it works. Like,

391
00:23:18,521 --> 00:23:20,110
if you really know your shit,

392
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,650
he trapped his hand and then came right
over the top with an album and I went

393
00:23:23,651 --> 00:23:27,270
look at that shit cause he's always
practicing it. Yeah. You know,

394
00:23:27,271 --> 00:23:31,330
he's always practicing Kung Fu,
but he's a very, very unusual guy.

395
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,170
Like there's all this talk about a Connor
rematch because financially that would

396
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:38,920
be a fantastic fight, right? Financially.
But when you look at what happened,

397
00:23:38,921 --> 00:23:40,480
that was a dominant victory.

398
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,290
I mean there was one round where
Connor did pretty good the third round.

399
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,130
Other than that could be just
sort of dominated him. Yeah.

400
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,710
I mean dropped him in the second,

401
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,610
beat the fucking shit out of him in the
fourth and the third was around where

402
00:23:52,611 --> 00:23:54,830
Connor did pretty good because
most of it was standing up.

403
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,960
I think he won that round. Right?
That was at the first round.

404
00:23:56,961 --> 00:23:59,360
Can Be you've ever lost?
Yeah, I think there was. Yeah.

405
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,780
But I mean it wasn't the one it like
rotting away. It wasn't like that.

406
00:24:02,781 --> 00:24:06,290
He blasted him in the body, had him
hurt and there was nothing like that.

407
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,130
It was just the edge. [inaudible]
it's hard to make. I mean,

408
00:24:10,131 --> 00:24:13,730
I guess you could say that's the same
thing that's sort of happened in the Nate

409
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,880
Diaz fight and, and Connor came back and
won the rematch. So this is the argument.

410
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:20,480
The argument is Connor was Rusty's
out of the cage for two years.

411
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:24,150
He gets back in, let's do a read. And
then financially, Jesus Christ me,

412
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,550
it was the biggest fight of all time.

413
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,510
They're saying is above 2.4
million pay per view buys,

414
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:32,870
which is fucking bananas.
Yeah, that's, that's huge.

415
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,790
So if it's bigger than that,
and then they,

416
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:40,550
if they could talk people into a rematch,
I get it, but I don't want to see that.

417
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:44,460
I want to see Tony. I want to see
Tony Dirty. Yeah, he's earned it.

418
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:49,010
And that could be the suspension.
Let them give a little money to somebody.

419
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:55,460
What's the wha I might take on
in life for him. You know, this,

420
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:59,780
that the whole thing is fucked. It's not
professional. Right. It shouldn't happen.

421
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,680
But neither should people
be fucking scream and shit
at him while he's fighting.

422
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,650
You know? And, and I guess that
was going on the entire time.

423
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,690
He was apparently having,
like Dylan Dennis was in the,

424
00:25:09,691 --> 00:25:13,910
in Connor's corner was screaming shit.
It could be while the fight was going on,

425
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:17,810
which I guess gets annoying.
Yeah. You said the new angle. Uh,

426
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:22,700
there's a new angle of video where
it could bebes Russian manager, um,

427
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,040
as,
as Connor is tapping,

428
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,970
he comes right behind Dennis and slaps
him on the back like three or four times.

429
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,990
I did see that. Yeah. Kind of instigating
something. Yeah, there's that.

430
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,000
And then someone said, could be a,
that Connor swung first, which is true,

431
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:38,451
but could be,

432
00:25:38,451 --> 00:25:41,900
but already gone over the cage and
someone's going to guide has coming at him

433
00:25:41,901 --> 00:25:46,170
and Connor swung at him, but I think it
was already chaos at that point. Yeah.

434
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,710
You know,
it's all very unfortunate,

435
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,170
but what happened really not,
no one got hurt

436
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:59,510
in any point of view down there. I
mean, did you, did you feel at all like,

437
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:03,020
oh man, this rights coming towards me or
anything like that? Did it spread around?

438
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,060
I am so fucking dumb. I'm so used to beat
the shit out of each other. It's like,

439
00:26:08,061 --> 00:26:09,980
oh, now they're beating the shit
out of each other over here.

440
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,440
Feel it didn't feel any more dangerous.

441
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:19,610
I was hoping the chairs wouldn't start
flying and then it wouldn't get too crazy.

442
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:20,930
And I was really,
really,

443
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:25,340
really hoping that someone wouldn't do
something stupid and hurt someone to the

444
00:26:25,341 --> 00:26:28,010
point where they would get kicked
out of the USC or suspended.

445
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,150
But that might be the case with that one
gentleman. What is his name? [inaudible].

446
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,970
What is his name? My fucking, I should
check my Instagram because it's,

447
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:38,480
it's filled with free.
Zoomba oh,

448
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:43,130
that's what the gentleman's name? Yeah.
Compared to like a training partner.

449
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,160
That's the guy that got fired. Yeah.
I, I'm talking about his fight with,

450
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:48,820
uh,

451
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:53,820
artists was supposed to be with Artem
and not a bad idea to cancel that fight

452
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,220
because it's so close to this and
obviously it's going to be so,

453
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,730
so charged up. Let me find homeboys. Yeah.

454
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,890
They just moved argument to fight
Michael Johnson, I think. Ooh. Hm. Uh,

455
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:10,290
there'll be good for, yeah, that'd
be a real good fight. Yeah. Um, yes.

456
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:13,510
You Baria they call. Yeah, seat save zoo.

457
00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:18,270
But this shit's all of my Instagram. You
crazy Russians. I see what you're doing.

458
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,330
This like all my mentions,
the zoo Baria Aye.

459
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,390
Aye Co I can't pronounce his last name.

460
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:29,820
T. U. K. H. U. G. O. V. Good luck.

461
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,480
Good luck with that one.
Jon. Anik can pronounce it.

462
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:36,810
He prowls as it flawlessly for his
bar is a very good fighter too.

463
00:27:36,811 --> 00:27:39,570
It's very unfortunate.
I hope they can work everything out.

464
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:44,010
He was supporting his brother.
He felt like there was a fight going on.

465
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:48,330
He was showing his loyalty. I get it.
There should have been more security.

466
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,410
They should have been better. They should
have talked to these guys beforehand.

467
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:56,790
They should have stopped all this
fucking nonsense beforehand. It's,

468
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,270
it's bad for the sport. It's bad for
the image. It's bad for them. It's,

469
00:28:02,271 --> 00:28:06,870
it's just, you know, there's no, nothing
good about it. But to Khabib's point,

470
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:10,440
there's nothing good about Connor throw
on that Dolly at the bus. That was worse.

471
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:13,530
That was worse. Yeah. I mean,
somebody should get really fucked up.

472
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:18,270
Fights killed because people got cut,
right? Yeah. I mean, um, you know,

473
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:22,050
I mean it chaos. I got pulled from his
fight. He had a big cut on his head.

474
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,360
He's still dealing with injuries I
think from that. Really? Yeah, yeah,

475
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,250
yeah. I saw him that one of
the Bella Tours, um, in, uh,

476
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:35,510
Chicago, uh, there and he
was like, man, I still, uh,

477
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,490
dealing with like flash concussions or
something like that. And I dunno, it was,

478
00:28:40,491 --> 00:28:43,100
it was really serious for him, for
him. I think he took the worst of it.

479
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,150
How did he get a concussion from
it? Don't quote me 100%. All right.

480
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:53,220
I know he had glass in his eye and I
just know that he was still dealing with

481
00:28:53,271 --> 00:28:57,080
residual effects. Residual effects
for me, I'm torn because I,

482
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,970
I was at a conference,

483
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:02,450
it was called like the summit of greatness
and we had a bunch of people that

484
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:02,901
came over.

485
00:29:02,901 --> 00:29:07,000
There was like 13 different people that
came over to our AIRBNB had a blast. Um,

486
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:10,100
there was some incredible people
there. Um, there's a guy that,

487
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,410
that I think you need to
know if his name's nick,

488
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:17,360
Saint Agnes Dasso and he's a guy that, uh,
that is incredibly inspirational to me.

489
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,980
I've gotten to know him and
he's got only one arm, no legs.

490
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:24,650
He's got one finger on one hand,
but he,

491
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,270
the way that he's overcome adversity
in his life. Incredible Dude. Um,

492
00:29:29,271 --> 00:29:32,570
he first started with skateboarding
with one arm and doing handstands on the

493
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:36,190
skateboard. Well after that
he started doing, uh, um,

494
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:40,000
bowling and then from there he
had a little bit of an arm on,

495
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,340
on his left arm, sorry. Yeah,

496
00:29:42,341 --> 00:29:45,940
his right arm and he wanted to wrestle,

497
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,870
but his parents said that he had this,
uh,

498
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:53,850
his bone was growing faster than his
skin and so on, on one of his arms.

499
00:29:53,851 --> 00:29:57,370
It has like a, uh, a problem with
it. And so he wanted to wrestle,

500
00:29:57,371 --> 00:30:01,150
but they said if he landed on that part
of his arm that the bone would stick

501
00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:01,870
through,

502
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:05,410
it would stick through and like stabbing
to the mat and that there's no way he

503
00:30:05,411 --> 00:30:06,244
could wrestle.

504
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:10,030
And he looked at his mom and dad and he
thought about it for months and he said,

505
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:14,110
mom and dad, what if we just cut it
off? Oh Jesus. And they're like, what?

506
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,370
And Nick says, what if you just cut off
my arm? Can, can I wrestle then you know,

507
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:22,880
my other arms gal and uh, they said, nick,
you're being pretty extreme here was,

508
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,530
and I call it cutting off, let's
call it an amputation and a, and no,

509
00:30:26,531 --> 00:30:27,790
you can't do that.
Well,

510
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:31,060
he just kept pushing the issue there
is right there and his Instagram,

511
00:30:31,061 --> 00:30:33,910
so was wound up getting it
cut off. Yup. So right there,

512
00:30:33,911 --> 00:30:36,190
it used to be five or six
inches longer than that.

513
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:41,000
And he went and got it lasered off. And
what he says is that he wants a, so yeah,

514
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:45,190
buddies with the rock. Um, he's a
bodybuilder too. He just wrote a book.

515
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:50,230
It's available on Amazon. Um, I think
it's called like from victim to victor.

516
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:54,450
Yeah, I mean that, that tire flip it
on his Instagram. It's wild if, if,

517
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:58,750
if you want to pull that up. But it's,
um, he's a really inspirational guy to me.

518
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,090
And, uh, he like literally, so,
uh, on that top left picture, um,

519
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:08,200
he calls that on his other arm, he calls
that his potato, that's what he calls it.

520
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:12,130
Um, but he had to have five or six
inches cut off so that he could wrestle.

521
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:15,670
And a really inspirational guy to me.
He's been like,

522
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,220
end my let's podcasts and lose housing.
Um,

523
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,720
his stories there are
incredibly inspirational and
thought the Neil melanzane

524
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:27,160
story was crazy. What's
that? Yeah, he, uh,

525
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,660
he broke his toe real bad and uh,

526
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:32,980
they were saying you couldn't roll for
six months. He had to put in his plant.

527
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:37,960
He said, how would you just cut it off?
Wow. And they said, okay. So they did it.

528
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,440
You know what you've seen?
Neil Mylanta is a giant gorilla for sure.

529
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,230
I didn't know he did that. He says,
cut my toe off. You just go, okay,

530
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:49,130
we'll just cut you off. I've
got to train somebody. So we,

531
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:52,990
it then it's so cut off so you could
keep training. And so nick and him,

532
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,790
they've got some screws loose,
but they're committed.

533
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,580
How committed are you that you want to
achieve this goal, this dream, his dream.

534
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,480
He grew up in New Jersey.
He was like,

535
00:32:01,481 --> 00:32:05,380
I want to be a wrestler and so I'm
going to, I'm going to do this, um,

536
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,550
incredibly inspirational guy.

537
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:11,050
So him and 12 other guys came over to
our airbnb and we watched the fights and

538
00:32:11,051 --> 00:32:14,980
it was controversies Khabib and we loved
watching everything that night and then

539
00:32:14,981 --> 00:32:16,440
whenever that happened.
Um,

540
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:19,690
so I'm torn on it because I
love those guys as fighters.

541
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,990
I absolutely love them as fighters.
Um,

542
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:25,330
and then whenever that happened is
just something that in me, I don't,

543
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,910
I don't know if I was embarrassed
where if I was disappointed,

544
00:32:27,911 --> 00:32:29,840
but they were introducing some guys,
uh,

545
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:33,820
Steve Weatherford who played for the New
York giants, He came over for like a,

546
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:37,360
he played for the giants for like 10
or 12 years, um, lives in San Diego,

547
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,770
great guy,
but he's not a big MMA fan.

548
00:32:39,771 --> 00:32:42,710
So I was explaining everything to them
and when that happened is just pretty

549
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:46,450
disappointing. Then I
spoke at, um, at, uh,

550
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,950
anti bullying coalition in Tulsa.

551
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:53,360
And I went there and there was a girl
there that, uh, she looked real sweet,

552
00:32:53,361 --> 00:32:55,490
real quiet, introverted, um,

553
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:59,450
and she worked with mental
health and everything was alley.

554
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,510
All of a sudden she found out I was an
MMA fighter and she said, oh my gosh,

555
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:05,420
you know, my husband's a
huge MMA fan. I'm not at all.

556
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,190
I never really even sat down
and watched it with him.

557
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:12,550
But then he decided to take me to the
t mobile arena for the first fight was

558
00:33:13,221 --> 00:33:15,560
Conor, Khabib and uh, she was in there.

559
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:20,150
She said she loved it before that
Michelle Waterson was an incredible

560
00:33:20,151 --> 00:33:21,020
inspiration to her,

561
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,920
her saying that she wants to be the first
mom to be a UFC champion. She said it,

562
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:28,130
the night was going great. And then
whenever that happened, she said it was,

563
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:31,610
it literally scared her because fight
started popping off to the right over

564
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,470
leftover behind her. She's going to
pour, poured out into the arena. Um,

565
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:39,440
and so that was her first introduction
to May. So I was a little tough to see,

566
00:33:39,441 --> 00:33:42,950
but at the same time, I get it.
Like those emotions are flaring.

567
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,930
And you were talking
about it too, and, uh,

568
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,850
kind of your perspective of
martial artists and, yeah,
I mean, same thing that,

569
00:33:49,851 --> 00:33:51,770
that you were feeling. Just, you know,

570
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:56,570
that little bit of kind of sadness
and disappointment of, you know, the,

571
00:33:56,571 --> 00:34:00,200
the biggest event, the most
views, the most people watching.

572
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:03,140
And that's the last thing that they
see. That's what they, you know,

573
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:07,310
go to bed thinking about and feeling
about. And, and I just, you know,

574
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:11,060
I don't think, uh, even
Keven Connor, it could be,

575
00:34:11,061 --> 00:34:14,180
that's not who they are as martial
artists, you know, uh, sure.

576
00:34:14,181 --> 00:34:19,130
All the emotions were flying and they,
you know, they have a history and,

577
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,030
and it's hard to let that
go, but I, I just don't,

578
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:26,180
I don't feel like that's
even who they really are.

579
00:34:26,181 --> 00:34:30,320
You see in all their other
fights, uh, they, they respect
their opponents, you know,

580
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:31,154
she can,

581
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:36,720
um, I mean, look, Connors,
that's what he does. Yeah.

582
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:39,210
He Talk Shit to people and fucks
with their head. I mean it's,

583
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:43,840
it's a giant part of his game and I know
that that was part of the strategy of

584
00:34:43,841 --> 00:34:48,370
him throwing that Dolly at the bus.
That shit's way out of line. I mean,

585
00:34:48,371 --> 00:34:52,450
throwing a Dolly at the bus. That's not
what a martial artist does. When you,

586
00:34:52,451 --> 00:34:52,721
when you,

587
00:34:52,721 --> 00:34:57,610
if you stop and think about what we
value about martial arts and turns of

588
00:34:57,611 --> 00:35:02,410
teaching children honor when we were
respect and discipline and the things,

589
00:35:02,411 --> 00:35:06,610
when we think of as a classical martial
artists like Leo to Machida or something

590
00:35:06,611 --> 00:35:10,600
like that, bowing to their
opponent, that is not, this is,

591
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:15,460
this is theatrical, this is
hype. But in all fairness,

592
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,590
the UFC used that to sell that fight.

593
00:35:17,591 --> 00:35:21,190
I mean that was a big part
of their promotional campaign
was seeing Connor throw

594
00:35:21,191 --> 00:35:25,300
the Dolly at the bus and the screaming
and yelling, you know, you're setting,

595
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,400
you're setting an exam.

596
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:31,030
There's something going on outside
of the actual content itself.

597
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:34,150
There's all this extra credit,
curricular violence, right?

598
00:35:34,151 --> 00:35:36,700
There's throwing a dollar at a
bus shattering in the window.

599
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,330
All these guys running and screaming,
get off the bus,

600
00:35:39,331 --> 00:35:42,180
and then they're promoting this,
they're showing this,

601
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:47,190
and then everyone's shocked.
Then it escalates after the fight itself.

602
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:50,940
You know, one of the, in some ways,

603
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:55,520
one of the more interesting moments of
the fight was Khabib on top of Connor

604
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:59,210
beating the shit out of him going, let's
talk now. Have you seen that video? Yeah.

605
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:02,310
That's fucking terrifying. It's
like, come on, let's talk. Bam.

606
00:36:02,311 --> 00:36:05,520
And he's just slamming. I am told him
he's got to do that before the fight too.

607
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:06,900
Yeah. I mean, yeah, we're going to talk.

608
00:36:06,901 --> 00:36:09,780
We're going to talk when I'm on top of
you and you're tired and I'm beating the

609
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:12,600
fuck out of you. That's what we're going
to talk. And that's what he did. You know,

610
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,300
this is all not what could be does,
right?

611
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:19,890
This is outside of his,
his,

612
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,730
if you look at his standard behavior,
he's very respectful. I mean,

613
00:36:23,731 --> 00:36:26,130
he's never had an incident
like this ever in a fight.

614
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:30,900
All of his fights before that,
or him shaking his opponent's hand,

615
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:35,370
doing the standard stare down standard
stuff, talking about his skill set.

616
00:36:35,371 --> 00:36:39,270
And what he's going to do and is,
no disrespect, there's no insults.

617
00:36:39,271 --> 00:36:42,930
There's none of this. That's what I
mean about Khabib. Yeah, but not Connor.

618
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:46,380
I mean this is a, but, but here's
the other thing. On the other side,

619
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:51,630
it makes it fun. I'm very torn because
all the shit that he talked to, Josie,

620
00:36:51,631 --> 00:36:54,150
Aldo, look, that was a big factor.

621
00:36:54,151 --> 00:36:59,151
And Josie Aldo charging at him losing
his composure face first and getting clip

622
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:00,540
at that left hand.

623
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:04,890
That's a big factor is the emotional
anx that he had gone through from months

624
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:07,490
and months on the road with this
guy. The middle of warfare. Yeah.

625
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,060
That mental warfare is a real thing.
It just didn't work with be,

626
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:14,790
but it had the opposite effect.
And with Khabib, he's like,

627
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:18,060
I can't wait to get my fucking
hands on you. It wasn't,

628
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:21,800
I can't believe this guy's saying
these things to me with Khabib bid,

629
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,530
but it ramped up the violence to the
point where he was letting you know, like,

630
00:37:25,531 --> 00:37:28,350
Hey, this is real to me. Like if you,

631
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,240
if you want to act thuggish and we'll
just keep going, we'll just, I'll you,

632
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:35,790
I'll keep taking it. Like he didn't
want to stop after Connor tapped,

633
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
like he was holding onto him and he's
letting them know, hey motherfucker,

634
00:37:39,001 --> 00:37:43,110
like this is real. This is not just
shit talking. Connor was saying to him,

635
00:37:43,111 --> 00:37:46,650
this is just business. It's just
business. And he's like, let's talk now.

636
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:50,280
Let's talk now. Like he, he's
like, this is not business to him.

637
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,780
So to him fights, I mean this is
what he said in the press conference.

638
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:58,050
It should be, this is a respect
sport and this should just,

639
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:02,690
sports should be about two men expressing
themselves to the best of their

640
00:38:02,691 --> 00:38:04,590
physical ability inside of the cage,

641
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,610
just doing their best against
the best fighters in the world.

642
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:12,420
And that should speak for itself and
that they should have respect and honor

643
00:38:12,421 --> 00:38:16,580
outside of it. I wish you would've had
the chance to say that, you know? Yeah.

644
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,660
We didn't have a chance.

645
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:22,700
The sad part was him letting the emotions
take over what he felt and instead of

646
00:38:23,131 --> 00:38:26,790
just getting the belt tied on and kind
of killing them with kindness at the end

647
00:38:26,791 --> 00:38:30,450
and saying that and having that chance
to put that in everyone's minds.

648
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,540
And he did in the post fight interview.

649
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:36,040
But I mean how many or the
post fight press conference,

650
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:38,080
but how many people got a
chance to see that? A lot less.

651
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,330
I mean just a few thousand I'm sure.

652
00:38:40,331 --> 00:38:44,950
And as in comparison to the 2.4 million,
the download, the paper view in the many,

653
00:38:44,951 --> 00:38:49,810
many, many, many more that saw the youtube
clips and Instagram's pips and yeah,

654
00:38:49,811 --> 00:38:51,820
I mean everybody saw it.
It's,

655
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:56,050
it's unfortunate but it's
also a financial windfall.

656
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,430
Like it's the whole thing.

657
00:38:57,431 --> 00:39:02,431
It's weird because part of what makes
Connor so interesting is that he's so good

658
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:07,420
at talking shit. He's hilarious
and he knows how to back it up.

659
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:12,430
But when we saw him fight
Khabib, he just, he fell short.

660
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,490
But it's really that simple
when skill versus skill.

661
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,860
He fell short and the the,

662
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:22,900
the shit talking led to could be being
v taking it very personal and very

663
00:39:24,371 --> 00:39:27,370
personal at the end and
then pointing at Dillon,

664
00:39:27,371 --> 00:39:31,240
Dennis and jumping off the top of
the cage. The whole thing was just,

665
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,770
it's so fucking crazy.

666
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:36,990
But the idea that people should be
surprised after Conor throws it,

667
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:41,560
Dolly at the bus and then still
winds up able to fight. I mean,

668
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,850
what did he do? Paid some money. Did
some, I mean we've got to do some,

669
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:48,520
some service.
What does he does community service.

670
00:39:48,521 --> 00:39:50,260
I don't even know what he has to do.
I don't either.

671
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:53,020
If there was something that's where
it's not, yeah, it's Kinda crazy.

672
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:58,410
Throwing a Dolly is fucking way worse
than punching a guy who punches people for

673
00:39:59,171 --> 00:40:01,660
a living, which is done. Dennis
is a professional fighter.

674
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:04,030
He's a professional fight. He jumps
out, he takes a swing at them,

675
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,700
they're screaming. He and Dylan is
like, fuck you. And he's like, fuck you.

676
00:40:06,701 --> 00:40:09,370
And there's a bunch of people get involved
and then a bunch of other people jump

677
00:40:09,371 --> 00:40:11,860
in.
The whole thing was nuts.

678
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:17,080
But the idea that we should be shocked
after him throwing a Dolly at a bus

679
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,360
because Khabib's on the bus.
That should,

680
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,990
those Russians don't
fucking play like that,

681
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:22,560
Matt.

682
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,010
This is videos afterwards when Dagestan
where they're shooting uzis and AK 47.

683
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:32,020
So I wrestled there, uh, when I was like
18, um, wrestled there and it was crazy.

684
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:35,290
They were taking us around everywhere
in g wagons and the ones in front of us

685
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:38,440
had like armed, uh, I don't know,
machine guns on top of them.

686
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,830
The one behind us are machine guns on top
of them. And then what was it? We were,

687
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,960
we were walking through one of the streets
and there's these big chains that are

688
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:51,250
in between the road and the sidewalk and
we're walking down the sidewalk and all

689
00:40:51,251 --> 00:40:56,020
of a sudden there's like a laser that
comes over and, uh, and our guys are like,

690
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:59,290
we gotta go, we gotta go. All of a
sudden a car came up onto the sidewalk,

691
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:00,970
started driving like they're
going to play us down.

692
00:41:00,971 --> 00:41:04,180
We had to jump into the road
to not get hit. And uh, I,

693
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:08,710
I don't know why that happened,
but after that we weren't allowed are uh,

694
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:12,400
the hotel we were in, we
had like balconies to where
we could look out, well,

695
00:41:12,401 --> 00:41:15,640
they had to move our rooms to where
we're inside to where we couldn't have a

696
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:19,960
balcony and everything else to where the
[inaudible] just because of that threat,

697
00:41:19,961 --> 00:41:23,530
because of the laser that came because
of the truck that came up onto the

698
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:26,420
sidewalk and tried to run us over.
There was some crazy rumors

699
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:31,010
that someone got arrested outside
of the, uh, t mobile arena.

700
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:33,770
See if that's true. If
someone got arrested, a gun

701
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,870
outside the t mobile arena on after
the fight or during the fight,

702
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,160
because it was, there was some
sort of crazy talk about threats.

703
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,310
The problem is you don't know how much
of that's bullshit, you know? I mean,

704
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,680
I probably should have researched
that before we talked about it.

705
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:52,960
But you see anything bullshit out of,
did they,

706
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:58,000
they post that
I heard the same thing that I heard.

707
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:01,840
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, yeah. I think I
heard it on Instagram. But yeah,

708
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:05,330
they don't play around.
It's a different world, man.

709
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,720
Especially Dagestan that's
all hard part of the country.

710
00:42:08,721 --> 00:42:11,960
Not the Dublin isn't hard,
but it's like that.

711
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,820
They're not known for their,
uh, humor and shit. Dot.

712
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:21,770
Yeah. Well, I, well, I went into a store,

713
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,061
I went into a store,

714
00:42:23,061 --> 00:42:26,770
like a little market and I was whistling
and dog is done and I didn't know that

715
00:42:26,771 --> 00:42:28,010
that was something disrespectful,

716
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:30,350
but someone came right up behind me and
just slapped me on the back of the head.

717
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:33,680
Like, Whoa, hold on. I'd probably
like, it can be just dead. Came up.

718
00:42:33,681 --> 00:42:35,810
And I knew that he was a bad dude,
so I wasn't gonna do anything.

719
00:42:35,811 --> 00:42:37,760
I just didn't know translator
had to come up and say,

720
00:42:37,761 --> 00:42:40,310
you don't whistle in public, you
know, Oh, you're having a good day,

721
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,030
please. Disrespectful. Then I can't
even whistle that good. But, uh,

722
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,510
but I was just kind of
whistling to myself.

723
00:42:47,511 --> 00:42:50,900
I didn't even know I was doing air
guitar. Yeah, that's probably bad.

724
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:55,450
It's probably that they don't show the
bottom of your feet. Like if you, uh,

725
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,990
that's for sure you can Google that.

726
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:00,020
But if you are sitting there and you
like cross your legs and you show the

727
00:43:00,021 --> 00:43:03,720
bottom of your foot, that's culturally
really disrespectful to show, um,

728
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:06,770
the bottoms of your shoes
or the bottom of your feet.

729
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,510
So they just don't play around there.
Um, and then so, so if you have your,

730
00:43:11,511 --> 00:43:15,830
like your foot on top of your thigh
like this, don't do that. Don't do that.

731
00:43:15,831 --> 00:43:18,950
Someone would come and slap your leg and
you make sure your feet are both on the

732
00:43:18,951 --> 00:43:22,140
ground. So just a lot of
cultural stuff, world.

733
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:26,390
That's why they're so tough. He's
climbing up those mountains. I mean,

734
00:43:26,391 --> 00:43:28,130
it's just jagged mountains.

735
00:43:28,131 --> 00:43:30,260
I remember it was one of the most
beautiful places I've ever been.

736
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:35,120
I'm just stunning. But just the, the hard
life. Did you see that? A Nike or, sorry,

737
00:43:35,121 --> 00:43:39,710
not Nike, but Reebok video that could
be did. It was, it was awesome. Yeah,

738
00:43:39,711 --> 00:43:42,770
it was awesome. But just seeing that
that's, that's the real life there. It's,

739
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:47,000
there's a photo of him that he posted
on his Instagram with his father,

740
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:49,760
him and his father.
He right after the fight,

741
00:43:49,761 --> 00:43:54,680
he did it like to explain like that this,
this what this is about to him.

742
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,240
His honor,
it's not about money.

743
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:00,590
It's about honor and respect and it's
a photo of him standing with his father

744
00:44:00,591 --> 00:44:04,330
with this incredible mountain range
behind him. Wow. Yeah. It's a,

745
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,830
it's a different part of the world. So
that, that strategy with Connor backfired.

746
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:14,450
But you think there's a point
where, uh, you know, just,

747
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:19,850
that's incredible. What a photo
that they should say. Hey,

748
00:44:19,851 --> 00:44:24,110
let's, let's turn the, the talking down
a little bit. How can you, that's what,

749
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:26,270
that's what got Connor to the dance.
I mean,

750
00:44:26,271 --> 00:44:28,520
it's one of the reasons
why it has escalated.

751
00:44:28,521 --> 00:44:32,370
It has escalated since all do to
then Mayweather bringing in his dad

752
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,500
and the assaults and
different stuff like that.

753
00:44:34,501 --> 00:44:38,670
And then could be going after his
family religion. Anything else? Yeah,

754
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:41,250
so it's gotten,
it's almost like he has to,

755
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:44,350
I think you were saying this
got one up on himself. You know,

756
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,880
for me it just kind of felt like,
you know, it wasn't a surprise.

757
00:44:47,881 --> 00:44:52,500
It was kind of like the Karma for the
UFC promoting the bus and you know,

758
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:56,780
and and letting it just keep
getting deeper and deeper. You know,

759
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:58,950
say it's the story and it is the story,

760
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:02,970
but at a certain point if it's something
that was illegal, hurt somebody,

761
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,870
maybe you don't use that.

762
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:07,380
I was really shocked that they were
using it and promotion. I was like, wow,

763
00:45:07,381 --> 00:45:11,120
I shouldn't be shocked. I thought that
when I saw the promo and I saw the, the,

764
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:11,420
the,

765
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:15,300
the Dolly flying at the bus and then
the video from the inside with the glass

766
00:45:15,301 --> 00:45:19,020
shattering, I was like,
okay, I guess I shouldn't be
shocked because it did happen.

767
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,120
You know, it is a part of the
story, but I mean is this,

768
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,220
is this encouraging this like what is,

769
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,600
I mean they're using it to sell the
biggest fight in the history of the sport

770
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:31,170
turned out to be true. It is the biggest
fight in the history of the sport.

771
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:35,940
Is that good? That doesn't
seem good. It seems,

772
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:38,580
it seems from my perspective

773
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:44,730
it's entertainment versus sport,
right?

774
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:47,820
When when it comes to sport,
like you would never use that to,

775
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:50,190
to advertise the Olympics. Right? Right.

776
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:53,010
They would never have an assault
to advertise the Olympics.

777
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:56,850
But this is something different. It's
commerce, there's a lot of money involved.

778
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:57,931
It's a,

779
00:45:57,931 --> 00:46:02,370
it's a huge cultural spectical
it's Conor McGregor who's,

780
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,410
he transcends sport.

781
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:09,440
He's this superstar in just the
world of just show business.

782
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:13,860
So it's different but different.
But at the same time, what,

783
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:17,160
this might be more for the
purest or hardcore MMA fan or,

784
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:19,530
or martial artists that
competes, but, but what,

785
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:22,620
what originally drew you to
the martial arts? I mean,

786
00:46:22,621 --> 00:46:24,590
I haven't heard that first hand from you,
but,

787
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,750
but what drew you to the
sport initially? Well, I mean,

788
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:32,340
like Raphael, I've found out about
Bruce Lee when I was a kid. I mean,

789
00:46:32,341 --> 00:46:35,220
Bruce Lee was the first,
I saw those Bruce Lee movies.

790
00:46:35,221 --> 00:46:39,090
I lived in New Jersey and an apartment
complex. And My, uh, my superintendent,

791
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,840
the apartment complex [inaudible], his
son was my age and I went over his house.

792
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:46,890
We watching a Bruce Lee movie. I
was like, Holy Shit, look at this.

793
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:49,710
And they ha he kid had nun chucks and
she had a whacked myself on the back of

794
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,030
head trying to practice doing checks.

795
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:54,000
But I remember watching that
guy throw kicks and you know,

796
00:46:54,001 --> 00:46:57,510
jumping off of tables and beating the fuck
out of all these dudes are coming out.

797
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,730
And every kid wanted to be Bruce Lee.
Every kid wanted to be Bruce Lee.

798
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:08,210
And then I took food class and then I
took karate and then I got into taekwondo

799
00:47:08,851 --> 00:47:10,800
and then I got into my time and
all these other different things.

800
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:15,180
But to me it was just martial
arts was, um, you know, it was,

801
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,590
it was a way to learn how to
fight, first of all, for sure.

802
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:23,670
But then it was also a way to
test yourself. But it was always,

803
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:27,210
there was no shit talking back then and
martial arts tournaments, it was node,

804
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,740
there was no trash talking.

805
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:32,020
Even if there was like little subtle
things that people would say to each other

806
00:47:32,021 --> 00:47:35,140
at the way in under each other's breath,
like I'm gonna fuck you up.

807
00:47:35,141 --> 00:47:39,070
Or something like that was very
quiet and it was very little of that.

808
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:42,340
Most of it was a bowing,
you know,

809
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:45,400
shaking hands and then there was the cyst,
the fight,

810
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:49,960
but there was also no money involved.
It was just fighting, you know?

811
00:47:49,961 --> 00:47:53,410
And I think that when you're dealing
with money and you're dealing with

812
00:47:53,411 --> 00:47:56,800
promotion, let's, let's just
be completely honest, con it,

813
00:47:56,801 --> 00:48:01,801
throwing that Dolly at the bus and Connor
talk and all that shit probably made

814
00:48:02,411 --> 00:48:06,490
that fight twice as big. Maybe you
would've got 1 million pay per view buys.

815
00:48:06,491 --> 00:48:10,750
They want them getting two
and a half million. It's
worth a lot of fucking money.

816
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:15,870
Think about two and a half million versus
what one extra million people buying

817
00:48:16,511 --> 00:48:18,460
it at whatever the fuck it cost.
What does it cost?

818
00:48:18,461 --> 00:48:21,690
70 bucks or something or is it
64 99 it's a lot of money, man.

819
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:25,990
Talking about a law, a lot
of money, you know, and then

820
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:32,490
it's worth more for other fights
because the whole card was so amazing.

821
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:35,470
It's going to get more people
to is your favorite card?

822
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:38,800
Favorite moment of the night? It
was a Derrick Lewis, Derrick Lewis,

823
00:48:38,801 --> 00:48:41,140
Tony Derrick Lewis,
Derrick Lewis,

824
00:48:41,141 --> 00:48:46,141
winning by knockout and in a fight where
he said that thing about Derrick Lewis

825
00:48:46,691 --> 00:48:49,330
is he can always just land one punch.

826
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:53,770
We had just got done saying that like
10 seconds before he lands his fucking

827
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:57,550
Howitzer on the top of that dude's head.
And then the post fight interview,

828
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:01,750
we say he takes his shorts off and I'm
standing here, what are you doing man?

829
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:04,450
It goes, my balls is
hot. I'm like, oh my God.

830
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,620
But I always knew Derek is hilarious.
He's always hilarious.

831
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:12,250
So I always look forward to
talking to him. But his Instagram,

832
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:14,020
if you want to know what
Derrick Lewis is about,

833
00:49:14,021 --> 00:49:16,960
you've got to go see his Instagram and
I brought that up and now he's got like,

834
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,110
he's got a million more than a million.
What does he at now?

835
00:49:20,111 --> 00:49:22,710
500 some thousand and just
a couple of days after that.

836
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:26,020
That's so awesome,
but it's true.

837
00:49:26,021 --> 00:49:30,100
It's fucking Instagram is all motorcycle
accidents do the jumping off roofs and

838
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:33,790
landed on their heads. It's a false
fucked up Instagram of all time,

839
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,490
but he's just a funny dude,
man.

840
00:49:36,491 --> 00:49:41,491
He's really funny and him and Daniel
Cormier like them promoting a fight is

841
00:49:43,061 --> 00:49:47,030
going to be a breath of fresh air because
like did you see the thing where you

842
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,870
know like Danny was joking around? He
said, he said, he's going to knock me out.

843
00:49:49,871 --> 00:49:52,860
He's like, yeah man, you was
disrespect and Popeye's fried chicken.

844
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,900
Let's play this because it's so funny.

845
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,630
Derrick Lewis told me that he was going
to knock me out right before we walked

846
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:03,140
Derek music.
What's your issue with Daniel?

847
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:06,590
I want to know too

848
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,380
this suspect that Popeye's chicken on it.

849
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:19,260
This is a bad version of it.
I bet

850
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,950
this is all music and stupid editing,

851
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:25,220
but he's just a funny guy,
man.

852
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,610
He's just a funny guy and he's look,
I mean,

853
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:32,420
and he joked around about it with DC. He's
like, you at 1.3 million followers now.

854
00:50:32,421 --> 00:50:33,254
That is hilarious.

855
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:36,230
You just gained a million followers
because I've been following him for years

856
00:50:36,231 --> 00:50:39,950
now. Yeah, I think he gained a
million followers and he, you know,

857
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:44,120
they were talking about it and he said
to Daniel, you know, uh, Dennis said,

858
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:47,060
he goes, you want it, you don't really
want to hit me. He goes, no, fuck off.

859
00:50:47,061 --> 00:50:48,050
Fight anybody for money.

860
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:52,580
It's just classic.

861
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:57,230
He's just a funny guy and there won't
be any of that do opening nonsense,

862
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:02,270
but it'll still sell a lot because
it's fun. So a lot of Popeye's too,

863
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,730
it's going to sell a lot and it's
going to sell out of everything,

864
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:07,400
but it'll definitely sell a lot of
paper views. The real question is,

865
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:11,240
is he going to be able to deal with
Cormier's wrestling coronaries experiment.

866
00:51:11,241 --> 00:51:16,190
This is the level of fighting
that Columbia is experience
is just significantly

867
00:51:16,191 --> 00:51:20,750
higher.
But Derrick Lewis has unbelievable power.

868
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,630
I mean his power,
his fucking no joke man.

869
00:51:23,631 --> 00:51:28,100
If you look at some of his Kao victories,
he's a brutal puncher. Brutal. He is.

870
00:51:28,101 --> 00:51:30,740
But I think if he and I,
I'm a big Derrick Lewis Fan,

871
00:51:30,741 --> 00:51:35,420
but I think if he fights DC like he fought
Volkov it's going to be a tough night

872
00:51:35,421 --> 00:51:37,250
for him. Um, I know that,

873
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:41,400
I know that it could go anyway and that
one shot from Derrick Lewis can put DC

874
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:45,740
out or anyone in the world out.
But I just see dcs wrestling has,

875
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:49,280
is dirty boxing. I mean
everything. If, if you, if,

876
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:52,310
if Derrick Lewis is
turning his back to DC,

877
00:51:52,311 --> 00:51:54,740
like he wasn't Volkov and he's
going to close the distance,

878
00:51:54,741 --> 00:51:56,390
he's going to take his back.
He's going to exploit that.

879
00:51:56,690 --> 00:52:00,230
He's going to take them down.
Sure. There's a difference
between six foot seven,

880
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,270
five foot 10 though.
It's true.

881
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:06,000
There's a giant difference in
size between Volkov and DC.

882
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:10,250
DC's a real light heavyweight who in my
opinion could fight and Raphael's weight

883
00:52:10,251 --> 00:52:12,920
class. I mean, I think DC
really got his diet in order.

884
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:15,410
He can be a one 80 to fiber.
It's true, but it can flip over.

885
00:52:15,411 --> 00:52:17,900
Josh Barnett over his head,
all sorts of guys.

886
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:21,050
There's something about that
that round body tight though.

887
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,560
I mean there really is like
a barrel, the, you know,

888
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:29,030
the ability to kind of be
ungrabbable you know, and uh,

889
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:32,780
of course he has the power and he
has the wrestling. So I mean, uh,

890
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:36,920
he's like a version of feed or you
know. Right. Very similar, very similar.

891
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:41,120
Seen him knockout Steve Bay with one shot.
Like that was stunning. It's like wow.

892
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:42,830
And he was saying that he
was doing that in training.

893
00:52:42,831 --> 00:52:44,660
He said he hits way
harder as a heavyweight.

894
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:48,680
I think just the way he likes to live
his life and how he likes to eat.

895
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:50,780
He just has more energy as a heavyweight.

896
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:56,240
He might be a better sound through a whole
life of cutting weight and the entire

897
00:52:56,241 --> 00:52:59,180
life of it. And uh, how to
withdraw from the Olympics.

898
00:52:59,181 --> 00:53:01,460
Because if kidney failure
from weight cutting,

899
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:06,050
his life should be a movie for sure. I
mean the way the stuff that he's overcome,

900
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:07,550
this stuff that has happened to them,

901
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:10,490
the missed opportunities and
wrestling and not miss opportunities.

902
00:53:10,491 --> 00:53:14,210
He was one of the, I mean he's so
great. Yeah. But not being the champion,

903
00:53:14,211 --> 00:53:17,330
that being the world champion up being
the Olympic champion and then coming to

904
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:20,060
in the life stuff that he's gone through.
Um,

905
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:23,270
I'm just happy that people like him now
cause you remember he was getting booed

906
00:53:23,271 --> 00:53:26,520
for so long. She was repeating every
time he got booed. I like broke my heart.

907
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:30,810
It took a while for people to understand
him and now I think that people,

908
00:53:30,811 --> 00:53:31,380
you know,

909
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:35,610
after people seeing him choke out rumble
Johnson and then seeing him knock out

910
00:53:35,611 --> 00:53:40,590
steep a people are like, oh he's a bad
motherfucker. And he's a really nice guy.

911
00:53:40,591 --> 00:53:43,570
He's a great dude. One of the best
commentators now. He's hilarious. Yeah.

912
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:46,620
That's also what made him
grow on people as well.

913
00:53:46,621 --> 00:53:50,340
Like you hear him and commentary and
you realize like he's not an EGOMANIAC.

914
00:53:50,341 --> 00:53:53,250
He's a really good guy who
knows a lot about fighting,

915
00:53:53,251 --> 00:53:57,090
knows a lot about wrestling and I'm a man.

916
00:53:57,090 --> 00:54:00,270
I'm so looking forward to John Jones
coming back to John Jones Fighting

917
00:54:00,271 --> 00:54:03,670
Gustafson. That is very
fascinating. Is that going to a,

918
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:08,100
I know they're going to strip DC, so is
that, is that fight for a title or, yeah,

919
00:54:08,101 --> 00:54:11,960
I guess interim or the real deal. I
think that's the real deal deal. Yeah.

920
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:13,050
Which is weird,
right?

921
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,740
Like why let the guy be champ champ
if you're not going to let them.

922
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:20,790
I mean I dunno. It's like, I don't know.

923
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:23,150
I mean I'm a time,
I'm so torn on all this,

924
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:25,890
but he's probably going to fight the
winter anyways and then it will be for the

925
00:54:25,891 --> 00:54:29,550
belt. So maybe let them keep the
belt. I mean look, I love the UFC.

926
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:31,620
Obviously I've been working
for the UFC forever,

927
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:36,650
but I think there is an obvious conflict
of interest when the promoter is also

928
00:54:37,921 --> 00:54:42,180
responsible for who holds titles
and who gets to fight for titles.

929
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:44,820
It's weird, you know, I mean,

930
00:54:44,821 --> 00:54:49,821
in every other sport there's like a
sanctioning body that decides this is,

931
00:54:49,891 --> 00:54:53,130
you know,
Rafael Lovato one five fights in a row.

932
00:54:53,131 --> 00:54:57,720
He's the undisputed number one contender.
He will be next in line for the title,

933
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,750
you know, not, oh Logan Paul's.

934
00:55:00,751 --> 00:55:04,950
So 5 million youtube buys these next.
You know what I mean? It's like,

935
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:09,300
it's weird, like it's,
it's weird that commerce,

936
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:13,230
I mean it plays a giant part in any sport,
right?

937
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:16,770
But should it be the
ultimate decider in what,

938
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:18,540
what happens and what doesn't happen?

939
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:21,510
Would you ever support the Mohammad
Ali act coming over to MMA?

940
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:24,550
I don't know exactly how that act
is structured. What does, what does,

941
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,300
what does it say? I don't know a
lot about it, but I know that, um,

942
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:30,170
I believe the moment of
the fill it up so we can,

943
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:32,760
we can talk about it from an
educated perspective for sure.

944
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:37,110
I think that the promoters have to split
50% of the revenue with the fighters,

945
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:41,580
I think. Is that what it says? I think
so. Um, I think, uh, that is part of it.

946
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:44,760
They would start doing
that Hollywood arithmetic,

947
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:48,750
like Hollywood of arithmetic,
like when when a movie comes out.

948
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,970
Do you know how that works?
Dude? It's hilarious.

949
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:56,150
When they people who have written movies
and produce movies and so and and dealt

950
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:57,540
with with studios,

951
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:03,200
they factor in all this other shit
like this is how much my car costs.

952
00:56:03,241 --> 00:56:05,520
This is how much it costs for gas.

953
00:56:05,521 --> 00:56:08,730
This is how much it costs to rent this
building. This is electricity. Oh,

954
00:56:08,731 --> 00:56:12,000
there's no more money leftover.
Okay. Here it says the Ali Act,

955
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:17,040
many professional boxing safety act
of 1996 specifies that a sanctioning

956
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:22,041
organization may not receive
any compensation from a
boxing mass match unless it

957
00:56:22,201 --> 00:56:27,201
files its bylaws and a complete
description of its ratings criteria,

958
00:56:28,601 --> 00:56:33,530
policies, and general sanctioning
fee schedule with the FTC.

959
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:38,050
The further directs the FTC to make this
information available to the public.

960
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:42,550
A sanctioning organization does not have
to submit this information to the FTC.

961
00:56:42,551 --> 00:56:43,330
However,

962
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:46,990
it makes the information accessible
through a public website or if you can

963
00:56:46,991 --> 00:56:50,500
translate that. I don't know
what the fuck. I don't know
if I've heard that part,

964
00:56:50,501 --> 00:56:54,290
which I'm not sure that that's
specific. The splitting the revenue. Um,

965
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:57,220
but then I also think it takes
out of the promoters hands.

966
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:58,270
What does that center look at?

967
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:02,920
Where it says law 15 us and what does
that fucking double squiggle shit?

968
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:06,430
What is that? I'd never seen that thing
before. They ever seen that thing before?

969
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:11,440
Have you seen it? You've seen it
yet. I mean in this context. Yeah.

970
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:13,870
I've never seen that thing before.
That's what, that's what the law is.

971
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:18,340
I mean like a dollar bill thing.
Like that's like, like a law.

972
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:22,070
That's a symbol for a lot. Have you
seen happen? I think so. There's a,

973
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:25,530
there's a law that, um, fight for the
forgotten has been looking into, um,

974
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:30,110
for bullying prevention. Uh, it's
called David's law at a Texas and that,

975
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:33,370
that same squiggly thing that
didn't even show up on Google.

976
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:35,980
He just googled it and it didn't show up.
Look at that.

977
00:57:35,981 --> 00:57:40,900
Did Not match any documents.
So, uh, okay. Whatever that is.

978
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:45,760
I mean, I guess that's a la
thing. I'm, look, I'm always,

979
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:50,170
I always favor the fighters always because
they have a very short amount of time

980
00:57:50,171 --> 00:57:52,900
to do it. They put the most on the
line. They have the most at risk,

981
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,900
the consequences of their
actions or you know,

982
00:57:55,901 --> 00:57:59,740
in terms of losing in terms of,
um,

983
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:01,570
just the,

984
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:06,070
the possibility that get horribly injured
in training and not get compensated.

985
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:07,000
There's all sorts,

986
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:12,000
there's a bunch of factors that I
don't feel are fair or just like,

987
00:58:12,491 --> 00:58:13,960
I was very upset when Tony,

988
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,980
when Tony Ferguson got
stripped mean he fell,

989
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:22,100
he ripped his knee apart and
they stripped him. I mean, look,

990
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:26,300
I get that there'd be upset that
the fight would happen. Uh, the,

991
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:28,780
the fight would not happen
and that he would, you know,

992
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:30,970
someone else would have to take his place.
I understand that.

993
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:33,550
But stripping them doesn't make any sense.

994
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:36,430
Like how could you get
stripped for an injury?

995
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:41,200
It's one thing if he did something to
someone like the John Jones situation

996
00:58:41,201 --> 00:58:44,440
crashing, don't lady's car took off
from the scene. That makes sense.

997
00:58:44,441 --> 00:58:49,240
It's an ethics violation, right? This is
not an ethics thing. He fell, you know,

998
00:58:49,241 --> 00:58:54,160
it's unfortunate promote the fight and
it's tripped over some wires and uh,

999
00:58:54,161 --> 00:58:56,710
it was erroneously stated by many people,
me included,

1000
00:58:56,711 --> 00:58:58,720
cause I read it somewhere that
he was wearing sunglasses,

1001
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:01,480
it was not wearing sunglasses inside.
He was just wearing glasses,

1002
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:04,840
just stepped over. So it was just a
freak thing, man. Just a freak thing.

1003
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:08,570
Stepped over some wires and especially
a guy as coordinated. Again,

1004
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:13,450
fucking crazy. Didn't make any sense.
Yeah. Crazy. I mean it's horrible,

1005
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,770
but there's no, no one
to say no to that. Right.

1006
00:59:17,771 --> 00:59:19,900
It's like how does that work?
How do you decide?

1007
00:59:19,901 --> 00:59:22,640
Like how do you decide who
gets stripped and who doesn't?

1008
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:26,240
Who's got an interim title mean?
How many interim titles can you have?

1009
00:59:26,241 --> 00:59:27,430
It's just like this.
Yeah,

1010
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:33,280
it's just weird just for the rankings
and the ability to get your shot,

1011
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,050
you know,

1012
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:39,050
just that by itself I think deserves
a sanctioning body 100% let alone the

1013
00:59:39,921 --> 00:59:42,500
ability for them to get paid
more and be more, you know,

1014
00:59:42,501 --> 00:59:46,220
fair across the board and everything.
Well you see how like you,

1015
00:59:46,221 --> 00:59:49,340
Sada has completely taken away.

1016
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:55,480
Like the UFC has nothing to say about
you sought a testing and about the

1017
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:59,570
punishment that it implements.
It's completely independent.

1018
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:03,170
So what they do is they come in,
they randomly drug test fighters,

1019
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:06,740
they make sure the fighters give
their whereabouts at all times.

1020
01:00:06,741 --> 01:00:10,730
They have to register and log in
and let everybody know wherever,

1021
01:00:10,731 --> 01:00:11,570
wherever they are.

1022
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:15,020
And if they violate that you
sought a hands out the punishment.

1023
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,510
And we've seen these
punishments and they're strict.

1024
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,910
They're very severe and they,
they,

1025
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:23,750
they take away a fighter's ability to
make an a living if they violate any of

1026
01:00:23,751 --> 01:00:26,510
their policies or if they test
positive for any supplements.

1027
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:30,930
They've since made a, what I think
is a welcome amendment where, um, if,

1028
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:32,720
if if a fighter,

1029
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:37,550
if it's possible that it's a tainted
supplement or they have a trace amount of

1030
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:41,660
something in, in there, they don't say
anything until after it's resolved.

1031
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:46,370
So instead of like putting the fighter
on blast and putting it out there to the

1032
01:00:46,371 --> 01:00:50,510
whole world, hey, this guy
tested positive. Instead of
doing that, they resolve it.

1033
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:53,510
And then smart. Yeah. Which
is the way they should do it,

1034
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:57,230
but still look at a guy like Josh Barnett.
Okay.

1035
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,360
Josh Barnett was ultimately exonerated,

1036
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:03,290
but he had to go like two years
where he couldn't make a living.

1037
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:08,000
And when your John is 40 years old,
this, that's fuck two years of spare,

1038
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:11,240
you don't have two years. Yeah,
right. That's fucking crazy. So,

1039
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:16,520
but my point is that is a
completely independent entity,

1040
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:20,180
right? It's outside of the UFC. His
ability to, they don't control that.

1041
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:24,320
They stepped back, they take care
of it. Kindness should be that way.

1042
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:29,870
And when it comes to who gets to fight
for the title, but if a title is a title,

1043
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:30,913
like if it's,

1044
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:34,970
if it's the world championship and you
look at a guy like Tony Ferguson, I think,

1045
01:01:34,971 --> 01:01:38,390
I believe he's 11 and one in the UFC,
right?

1046
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:42,860
He's on this crazy win streak. He's
fucking beaten. You look at his,

1047
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:48,070
his like, who's who of who?
He's beaten crazy. Domino's.

1048
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:51,560
Kevin Leisurely. No one else. For him
to fight, he has to fight for you.

1049
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:54,920
Speeding the elites. Oh, the only person
he hasn't beaten is Connor and could be,

1050
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:58,710
those are the two guys. Fuck man. Yeah.

1051
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:02,870
You got to slip. If you looked at
it that way, you'd say he's next.

1052
01:02:02,871 --> 01:02:07,850
But if you are mister money bags,
Connor wants a rematch.

1053
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:10,290
Oh, Connor, let's give you
a rematch. Come on to me.

1054
01:02:10,291 --> 01:02:13,450
The area where the sport and
entertainment crosses, right.

1055
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:16,050
What do you think about tournament's
coming back to the OCR or,

1056
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:17,210
I mean they haven't done that,

1057
01:02:17,211 --> 01:02:20,010
but what do you think about them
doing that for finding out who's going

1058
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:23,220
to fight for the title Bella towards
doing it now? PFLS been doing it.

1059
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:25,350
My Buddy Josh Copeland just made it too.

1060
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:30,370
He was ranked eighth seed came in and
fought two times one night and uh,

1061
01:02:30,771 --> 01:02:32,440
and Vinny Mag and nice as well.
Yeah.

1062
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:34,980
And that was a awesome triangle
to beautiful submission.

1063
01:02:34,981 --> 01:02:38,910
He's like one of the most
underappreciated guys in MMA, you know,

1064
01:02:38,911 --> 01:02:42,540
because one of the few that can
jump guard and you're fuck man,

1065
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:43,800
that guy wrapped his legs around you.

1066
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:47,550
He just had a rocky start
because his striking Rosenthal,

1067
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:51,770
but now it is mean. He's head kicking
people and knocking them out. Did you see,

1068
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:55,040
did you see Josh Copeland's a
knockout, a heavyweight? Uh,

1069
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:58,160
it was one of the best
knockouts, heavyweight in
the long time. No, I didn't.

1070
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:01,260
A lot of time. It's on my Instagram.
If you're able to pull that up, Jamie.

1071
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:06,300
It's a police. It's, um, on my
Instagram and it was awesome.
He got the deepest cut,

1072
01:03:06,301 --> 01:03:08,100
one of the deepest cuts
I've ever seen in my life.

1073
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:13,050
He could see a skull and it went, it
went farther than his eyebrow. And uh,

1074
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:17,010
he got cut probably five seconds
before he gets the knockout punch.

1075
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,870
And if he wouldn't have got that,
they would have stopped.

1076
01:03:18,871 --> 01:03:20,730
It came in ranked eighth seed.

1077
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:25,890
Now he's going into new New York City,
Madison Square Gardens in New Year's Eve,

1078
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:29,580
um, and fighting for $1 million.
How does this work? How does,

1079
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:32,370
what does the million dollars,
what does that mean?

1080
01:03:32,371 --> 01:03:36,150
Like there's every weight class when a
million, I believe that they have 10,

1081
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:39,270
they're giving away 10 million.
So at least 10 weight classes. Um,

1082
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:44,130
I think for the women to, they air on
NBC, NBC sports, NBC sports. So it's like,

1083
01:03:44,131 --> 01:03:49,050
uh, one of the cable channels.
Right. And then, uh, for Josh, they,

1084
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:54,180
they just fought in New Orleans and he
had a fight, a two round fight first.

1085
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:55,860
And then he followed me around too,

1086
01:03:56,460 --> 01:04:00,090
cause they wouldn't allow you then the
state commission wouldn't life height

1087
01:04:00,091 --> 01:04:04,350
more than five rounds in one night.
And so the first round or first fight,

1088
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:09,240
um, first part of the tournament was a
two round fight and he had to fight the

1089
01:04:09,241 --> 01:04:13,380
number one seed and he beat
him. And then an hour later, uh,

1090
01:04:13,470 --> 01:04:17,970
he had to fight again. Here's Josh.
It was just a brutal knockout,

1091
01:04:17,971 --> 01:04:22,140
but he got cut right over the eye.
And then right here he just, Oh damn.

1092
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:25,800
Oof Dam. One of the, one of the
best knockouts I've seen in a while.

1093
01:04:25,801 --> 01:04:28,000
But it's a ton.

1094
01:04:28,001 --> 01:04:30,990
He looks way thicker than when
he was fighting in the UFC.

1095
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:34,980
He's really gotten his nutrition under,
but if you can see that cut or his,

1096
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:39,180
I mean, it was brutal. Um, Bas Rutten was
interviewed afterwards. He's like, Josh,

1097
01:04:39,181 --> 01:04:43,010
I can see your skull. Right. That's
a haymaker of a right hand hold.

1098
01:04:43,011 --> 01:04:46,860
My Shit was chasing
him. Yup. I mean, yeah,

1099
01:04:46,861 --> 01:04:50,070
he looks much better physically than
he did when he was fighting in the UFC.

1100
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:52,980
Yeah. He's been working his butt
off. He's earned it. And uh,

1101
01:04:52,981 --> 01:04:54,240
now he gets a fight for $1 million,

1102
01:04:54,241 --> 01:04:57,830
which he training down with you
guys in Oklahoma. He, he isn't. Um,

1103
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:01,140
whenever I am in Camp Hill come down
for like two weeks before my fight.

1104
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:05,760
It's a super nice guy. Super Fun guy.
He really seems like a really nice guy.

1105
01:05:05,761 --> 01:05:08,160
I've met him before, but I
don't know if you know, he's a,

1106
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:13,680
he's a nine time competitive rocky
mountain oyster eating champion Colorado,

1107
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,950
which by the way is bull testicles.
Yup. People that don't know,

1108
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,960
he's the only guy I've been with that uh,
we go to.

1109
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:24,340
So have you ever heard of the Big
Texan, the 72 ounce steak? The large,

1110
01:05:24,410 --> 01:05:26,950
this is an Amarillo 72 ounce steak.
You'd have to eat in an hour.

1111
01:05:26,951 --> 01:05:30,910
You have to pay for it. 72 ounce
steak, huge, large baked potato,

1112
01:05:30,911 --> 01:05:35,320
loaded a dinner salad, shrimp
cocktail, huge dinner roll.

1113
01:05:35,321 --> 01:05:39,430
You have to drink a 72 ounce soda with
it and man the diets on or does it have

1114
01:05:39,431 --> 01:05:43,180
to be a regular side? I don't
know. Yeah, that's preposterous.

1115
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:48,310
The man versus food guy barely
finished it. Barely finished it.

1116
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:51,670
Members of food. Uh, I think
it was like 58 59 minutes,

1117
01:05:51,671 --> 01:05:54,940
something like that Josh did in 32
minutes. I think it was the fastest.

1118
01:05:54,941 --> 01:05:59,580
That's never been done. Fucking cry.
And then, and then you get this.

1119
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:02,500
So have y'all ever seen the
endless shrimp at red lobster?

1120
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:06,280
So Josh went to red lobster
in the shrimp and uh,

1121
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:11,050
and he asked them what was the most
someone's ever eaten and shrimp and he had

1122
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:12,700
already eaten a bunch of Iga.
He always says,

1123
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:16,600
you don't go to red lobster and not
start off with the cheddar biscuits.

1124
01:06:16,601 --> 01:06:17,710
You know,
you have to eat those.

1125
01:06:17,711 --> 01:06:19,570
You had like three or four of
those are whole basket of them.

1126
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:22,030
And then the lady said,
I think the most anyone's ever eaten was,

1127
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:25,420
I think it was two 26 226 shrimp

1128
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:28,180
and,
and Josh,

1129
01:06:28,930 --> 01:06:33,340
226 like of the like coconut or
fried shrimp, whatever it is.

1130
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:37,710
And Josh is like, there's my mark. That's
what I'm going to do. Um, or that's me,

1131
01:06:37,711 --> 01:06:39,090
that's my goal kind of cows.

1132
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:44,770
And the guy told us food stories all
night that he's rolling and he's got like

1133
01:06:44,771 --> 01:06:45,760
four or five restaurants.

1134
01:06:45,761 --> 01:06:50,650
He's literally not allowed in
public or like it's not a joke. So,

1135
01:06:50,651 --> 01:06:54,940
so Josh gets, he gets to like two 50 and
they're like, okay, you broke the record.

1136
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:56,590
And he's like, no, I'm still hungry.

1137
01:06:56,770 --> 01:07:00,310
And so he gets to 300 he
gets the 300 300 shrimp.

1138
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:02,290
He ends at 400 and calls,

1139
01:07:02,291 --> 01:07:07,291
it goes 400 shrimp and calls it
good to put it on like a cube.

1140
01:07:07,870 --> 01:07:12,310
If you have like a box 400 fried
shrimp in it. I don't know.

1141
01:07:12,311 --> 01:07:16,970
He smelled like garlic for three days
afterwards then. Then we went to, I dunno,

1142
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,960
I'm going into all the stores.
We went into an all,

1143
01:07:19,961 --> 01:07:23,090
you can eat crab restaurant
or sorry he did. And uh,

1144
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:26,410
it was all you can eat crab legs and
he's just ordering bucket after bucket

1145
01:07:26,411 --> 01:07:30,790
after bucket of, of crab legs. And they
come over and finally said this, sir,

1146
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:34,840
there's gotta be a limit somewhere.
And so they ask you to leave.

1147
01:07:34,841 --> 01:07:37,030
I have to ask you to leave so he can eat.

1148
01:07:37,031 --> 01:07:39,010
But now he's gotten his diet
under control and everything else.

1149
01:07:39,011 --> 01:07:41,290
Whenever it came to grudge,
whenever I got off the ultimate fighter,

1150
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:45,850
he came in at over 350 pounds. I think
it was three 56 or maybe it's three 46,

1151
01:07:45,851 --> 01:07:49,610
something like that. I think he
walks around at like two 45 to 50.

1152
01:07:49,611 --> 01:07:50,830
He looks a lot slimmer,

1153
01:07:50,831 --> 01:07:53,530
but he also looks thicker looking
at shoulders and the chest.

1154
01:07:53,590 --> 01:07:54,700
He's been working with Lauren Landau,

1155
01:07:54,701 --> 01:07:58,090
who most of the great guy that Brendan
worked with. And I was in Colorado.

1156
01:07:58,091 --> 01:08:02,840
It was in Colorado. So he's trained
with elevation and a and m. Oh,

1157
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:08,050
uh, man. Why am I forgetting the main
place that he trains that? Um, but,

1158
01:08:08,051 --> 01:08:12,260
uh, Ryan, anyways, uh,
trials, MMA and, uh,

1159
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:15,800
Fort Collins is where it's
training mainly. And uh,

1160
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:17,990
but I'm just so stoked for
million dollar tournament,

1161
01:08:17,991 --> 01:08:20,780
Bella Tours doing the million
dollar tournament now. Um,

1162
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:24,310
I think it'd be something, I don't know.
What is 50 cent? Half to do with Bellator?

1163
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:29,030
He's like offering all the championing.
Yeah, he's, he's talking to Khabib now.

1164
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:31,670
What does he do with bell toward,
does he have,

1165
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:36,350
I think he's helping them promote it. Um,
I actually, I'm still, um, where you are.

1166
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,910
I'm like, what does he have to
do with this? But he's seeing,

1167
01:08:38,911 --> 01:08:42,860
he's promoting his champagne money.
His is on the,

1168
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:46,850
on the canvas and on one of
the cancers on champagne. Yup.

1169
01:08:47,150 --> 01:08:50,120
And so he's giving everyone in the
champagne after they win their fights and

1170
01:08:50,121 --> 01:08:54,390
stuff like that. And so it's a strange
combination to him. 50 cent and,

1171
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:57,620
and he keeps saying he wants
a fight. People too. Yeah.

1172
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:01,580
What's going on with that? I Dunno,
but if you support and Bella to her,

1173
01:09:01,581 --> 01:09:04,280
I don't know. There we go. I'm
not necessarily against it,

1174
01:09:04,281 --> 01:09:05,570
but I don't know what's going on.

1175
01:09:05,571 --> 01:09:07,580
Do you think he's actually going
to fight someone or is it just,

1176
01:09:07,581 --> 01:09:10,660
it seems like it's all just a lot of
fun. Yeah, I think it's fun. It's fun.

1177
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,890
It's fun. I think it's for
promotion of this new champagne.

1178
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:16,280
Do you enjoy working for
them? Yes, I do very much.

1179
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:18,950
It seems like a great organization and
everybody that I know that went over

1180
01:09:18,951 --> 01:09:19,784
there really.

1181
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:22,270
Yeah, super pro professional. Uh,

1182
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:25,290
everyone's really friendly and a
lot of it is a great guy. Yeah.

1183
01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:29,300
A lot of Jujitsu guys on the staff too.
So I like to feel that love.

1184
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:33,860
And it was funny the last
time, um, you know, Changi,

1185
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:38,630
he's always in my corner
and um, uh, you know,

1186
01:09:38,631 --> 01:09:43,040
one was in Chicago, a
rich, rich chow who's also,

1187
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:47,300
I hope I said his last
name right. Um, who's also,

1188
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:52,720
I think it might be Joe. He trains
Jujitsu and, and Shawn g was like,

1189
01:09:52,721 --> 01:09:56,680
hey, the matchmaker for belts.
Yes. Taken us to Hawaii next. Yeah.

1190
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:59,930
And they've met before. And Johnny's like,
Hey, did you bring your g let's roll.

1191
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:02,850
You know, let's, let's go train. And
we said, oh, no, I don't have Maggie.

1192
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:06,200
I'm too busy. He's got a lot of
things going on. Well in, um,

1193
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,630
in Idaho for the last one,
uh,

1194
01:10:08,631 --> 01:10:13,300
rich had his key and he was totally ready
for Shawn Gee, this time. And a man,

1195
01:10:13,301 --> 01:10:17,690
they ended up training like probably,
I think they did at least two,

1196
01:10:17,691 --> 01:10:21,650
maybe three sessions. And each time was
like an hour or over an hour straight.

1197
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:23,850
And, um, you know, uh,

1198
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:27,470
they had a lot of fun and Richard was like
ready for ready for it. And he's like,

1199
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:30,860
how am I [inaudible] next day he's
texted Changi. I'm ready. Let's go again.

1200
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:35,770
You know? Yeah. It's so, so
cool to see him and Solow. Well,

1201
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:37,370
tell everybody who you know,

1202
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:42,410
solve who barrow and Changi or just to
elite Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belts.

1203
01:10:42,861 --> 01:10:47,820
And they're down in San
Diego. Yeah. They're from the
Amazon, from announce. Um,

1204
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:52,610
Saul was a six time world champion.
Uh, he's the older brother, uh,

1205
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:55,640
[inaudible] seven time world champion,
two time absolute world champion.

1206
01:10:55,641 --> 01:10:59,690
He's the greatest heavyweight that ever
has ever been in Brazilian Jujitsu. Um,

1207
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:03,320
it's a really cool story.
Uh, I was 19 years old.

1208
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:08,330
I was a brown belt and I competed
in my first professional event.

1209
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:10,940
Uh, it was a nogi pro tournament. Um,

1210
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:15,990
and Ohio is the part of the
Arnold classic event that goes on,

1211
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:19,650
uh, with, uh, the bodybuilding
and all that. They had a,

1212
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:24,000
a Jujitsu competition and they
had a pro Nogi tournament.

1213
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,250
It was only three weight classes.
It's like a lightweight,

1214
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:28,780
a middleweight and heavyweight.
And it,

1215
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:33,660
at that time it was like the biggest Nogi
tournament that there was besides for

1216
01:11:33,661 --> 01:11:38,490
ADCC. And a lot of the ADCC
champions would do that event, um,

1217
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:42,660
to win the money of course. And then
also just kind of prepare for ATCC, uh,

1218
01:11:42,661 --> 01:11:47,420
later in the year. And I
knew Saul, he had, um, uh,

1219
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:49,970
his home base has affiliations,
uh,

1220
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:54,270
associates association schools
where we're at in the beginning, um,

1221
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:58,920
in that area of the country in Ohio.
And he always competed at that tournament,

1222
01:11:58,921 --> 01:12:03,660
so to Changi. And so I knew there was
a great chance that, uh, you know,

1223
01:12:03,661 --> 01:12:05,960
all we get a chance to face
Solow going into that event.

1224
01:12:05,961 --> 01:12:10,770
And I had to send my resume in to, to,
to get accepted into the pro tournament.

1225
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:14,340
And I'll never forget the email
they send me where it was like,

1226
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:18,360
you've been accepted. Congratulation Saul.
He Beto was in your division. Good luck,

1227
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:22,650
you know, and how am I, okay. Uh,
how awesome. I'm already thinking,

1228
01:12:22,651 --> 01:12:25,200
how awesome would it be to have a
mattress? Sol, I'm 19 years old.

1229
01:12:25,201 --> 01:12:29,310
Saw was already six time world
champion, a legend already. Um,

1230
01:12:29,610 --> 01:12:34,260
and so, you know, go to the tournament
and sure enough it was destiny man.

1231
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:38,160
Uh, we're on opposite sides
of the bracket and you know,

1232
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:42,040
he clears out his side, gets
the finals, no problem. Um,

1233
01:12:42,050 --> 01:12:43,190
and I find my way to the finals.

1234
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:47,070
I had four matches and actually in the
semifinals I ended up going against one

1235
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:51,260
of his black belts. Um, and it was the
first time I ever faced a black belt.

1236
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,350
At that time there wasn't a whole bunch
of Gnocchi opportunities, you know,

1237
01:12:55,351 --> 01:12:59,290
where you could be a non black
belt and fight a black belt. Um,

1238
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:03,420
and I was losing on points and
at the end I started coming back.

1239
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,350
And I was able to submit,
uh,

1240
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:10,640
his black belt and go to the finals and
his black belt kind of threw a fit and,

1241
01:13:11,041 --> 01:13:13,980
um, was pretty disappointed.
Uh, wouldn't shake my hand,

1242
01:13:13,981 --> 01:13:17,520
wasn't there when the referee was raised
her hand and I could feel all this

1243
01:13:17,521 --> 01:13:18,810
energy because it was kind of,

1244
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:21,930
I think everyone thought they were going
to close it out together, you know?

1245
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:25,650
And uh, and they do that
though. Would they fight it out?

1246
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,860
Every tournament is
different. Oh Wow. Yeah.

1247
01:13:28,861 --> 01:13:32,040
It probably bowel out and then
they would share the prize money.

1248
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:34,260
There was a substantial
prize money for first place.

1249
01:13:34,261 --> 01:13:39,261
I think it was like five grand
and second place was like 1500,

1250
01:13:39,301 --> 01:13:42,120
something like that. Uh, it was the
first time I got paid to compete.

1251
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:46,820
Like I w I ever won money.
I was super pumped, but um,

1252
01:13:47,310 --> 01:13:48,630
yeah, so, you know,

1253
01:13:48,631 --> 01:13:51,390
I'm going into the finals against Saul
and I just beat one of his black belts

1254
01:13:51,391 --> 01:13:55,080
and I was just like, whoa. I was
so nervous, so scared, you know?

1255
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:59,100
But it's an absolute legend. Yeah. And
I'm 19, I'm a brown. And it, you know,

1256
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:04,340
it wasn't like today where you see all
these legends and these world champions

1257
01:14:05,131 --> 01:14:07,890
all the time. Like at that time
they were all in Brazil, you know,

1258
01:14:07,891 --> 01:14:09,660
and so it was hard to see this guy.
He's like,

1259
01:14:09,930 --> 01:14:13,600
the only time you saw him as if were in
Brazil and they were still very, like,

1260
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:18,160
they had this mystique about them and you
know, it, it was just a different vibe.

1261
01:14:18,161 --> 01:14:21,900
There were way more scary, I guess you
could say, way more intimidating, um,

1262
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:24,320
back then. So I was definitely
super intimidated, but you know,

1263
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:27,310
at the same time I was fired up, you
know, I want to be a world champion.

1264
01:14:27,311 --> 01:14:31,120
I get to face, you know, a
legend and, um, let's go.

1265
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:34,840
And so we had a good match.
Uh,

1266
01:14:35,010 --> 01:14:39,760
I was able to last for a
good amount of time, but, uh,

1267
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:43,960
he eventually passed my guard, mounted
me and submitted me at the very end. And,

1268
01:14:43,961 --> 01:14:48,460
uh, you know, I wasn't disappointed. I
was happy. It was like, man, you know,

1269
01:14:48,490 --> 01:14:51,970
this was the first time I got to face
someone like that. And I did my best.

1270
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:56,740
I was able to keep my guard for a while.
So I was, I was proud of that. Um,

1271
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:00,600
but at the same time, you know, he, he
mounted me, tapped me and, and you know,

1272
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,820
that's what he was supposed to
do, you know. Um, but he, uh,

1273
01:15:04,090 --> 01:15:08,650
he was so nice to me afterwards,
give me a big hug and we talked and um,

1274
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:12,550
and that was kind of that at that moment,
but I felt like I had earned his,

1275
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:16,450
his respect. You know, fast
forward a few months later,

1276
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:20,860
I'm in Brazil and at that time
there was two world tournaments.

1277
01:15:20,861 --> 01:15:24,950
There was a second organization,
um, called the CB and, oh,

1278
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,590
so there was the CBG J and then there
was a CBG J oh. And they were paying,

1279
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:32,200
there was a world championships
that were paying, um,

1280
01:15:32,201 --> 01:15:35,620
Nova Uniao kind of created that event.
They separated,

1281
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:40,600
didn't want to support the original a
world championships and they made their

1282
01:15:40,601 --> 01:15:43,120
own world championships and a,

1283
01:15:43,121 --> 01:15:45,820
and they were paying and that was the
way they could get a lot of guys to come

1284
01:15:45,821 --> 01:15:49,630
over and support that tournament. And
it was big. It was pretty much the same.

1285
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:51,070
It was basically the same thing.

1286
01:15:51,071 --> 01:15:53,410
There was only a couple of teams
that didn't support that tournament.

1287
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:54,491
And at the same time,

1288
01:15:54,491 --> 01:15:57,610
there was a couple teams that competed
that tournament that didn't support the

1289
01:15:57,611 --> 01:16:00,670
original worlds. So depending on
what division you were fought in,

1290
01:16:00,671 --> 01:16:04,090
it was either exactly the same
or it was tougher, you know,

1291
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:06,040
especially in the
lightweights because Nova,

1292
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:10,720
Ya'll had all the best lightweights at
that time. And so I'm at that event,

1293
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:14,590
I competed there and Solow
wasn't competing that year.

1294
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:17,980
And so he was very approachable.
He wasn't fighting,

1295
01:16:17,981 --> 01:16:22,810
he was just coaching and uh, and I
competed, I was a brown belt still.

1296
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:27,580
And I come over and I say,
what's up to solo? And uh,
oh. He's like, hey my brother,

1297
01:16:27,581 --> 01:16:31,000
good to see you. [inaudible] how
you doing? Uh, and he's like,

1298
01:16:31,001 --> 01:16:33,490
where are you training? And tell him
where I'm training. He's like, well,

1299
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:37,720
you want to come train with me? So
yeah, I would love to. And he was like,

1300
01:16:37,721 --> 01:16:42,220
here's my card. Give me a call on Monday.
I'll come pick you up. Sure enough,

1301
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:45,130
a column. He comes to my
hotel, him and Shawn Gee,

1302
01:16:45,190 --> 01:16:47,230
they pick me in a couple of my friends up.

1303
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:51,850
They drive me all the way to Copa Cobana
we were staying in Baja and we go and

1304
01:16:51,851 --> 01:16:54,280
train and a man,

1305
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:59,050
like just seeing the way he
interacted with his guys, the energy,

1306
01:16:59,051 --> 01:17:03,190
the way I felt there. Um,
you know, at this time there
was, there was a lot of the,

1307
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:05,710
you know,
how do I put it?

1308
01:17:05,711 --> 01:17:10,540
Like there was a resilience and
then you're a Gringo, you know. Uh,

1309
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:11,121
it was,

1310
01:17:11,121 --> 01:17:16,121
it was hard to go to Brazil and like learn
a lot and have someone really kind of

1311
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:20,510
open up and, and, and help you and
show you and teach you a lot. I mean,

1312
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:22,760
Eddie would know,
I'm sure you've heard the stories.

1313
01:17:22,761 --> 01:17:26,780
I remember being in Brazil with Eddie
long time ago, um, at back in the day,

1314
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:31,910
uh, you know, you just, especially if they
felt like you were a threat, you know,

1315
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:34,550
they wouldn't show you a lot because what
a few minutes of fighting one of their

1316
01:17:34,551 --> 01:17:35,720
buddies.
But you know what I mean?

1317
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:39,890
And so this was the first time
that I wasn't treated that way.

1318
01:17:40,010 --> 01:17:42,160
And you know,
Salo in Sean's,

1319
01:17:42,161 --> 01:17:46,960
he really opened up and
was like, you know, um, uh,

1320
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:50,870
bringing me sort of into their family
right away. Do you speak Portuguese?

1321
01:17:51,470 --> 01:17:54,460
I'm not a hundred percent fluent,
but I'm pretty good. You know,

1322
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:57,350
I can go to Brazil and,
and do whatever, you know,

1323
01:17:57,380 --> 01:18:00,370
I need to do and be on my own and be fine.
Um,

1324
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:03,350
at that time my Portuguese wasn't
as good as what it is today.

1325
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:06,710
Did you take classes or the next year?
Actually,

1326
01:18:06,711 --> 01:18:11,300
the year after this in 2004, I
lived in Brazil for four months. Um,

1327
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:15,890
and that's when I really got
pretty good at Portuguese. But, um,

1328
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:19,880
you know, anyways, he was open
to answering my questions.

1329
01:18:19,881 --> 01:18:22,250
He was teaching me stuff and,
and we trained,

1330
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:25,940
I trained there all week in between
the time from the first worlds into the

1331
01:18:25,941 --> 01:18:30,290
other, the main worlds. Um,
and I just kind of knew,

1332
01:18:30,291 --> 01:18:34,160
like immediately, like, man, this
is, this is what I want, you know,

1333
01:18:34,161 --> 01:18:39,161
and it was the first time
I ever had someone of that
level be open to helping me

1334
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:44,330
and taking me under his wing.
And so we stayed in touch. Uh,

1335
01:18:44,331 --> 01:18:47,740
shortly after that trip to
Brazil, he came out and, uh,

1336
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:50,900
to Oklahoma and taught a
seminar at my dad's school.

1337
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:55,670
That time my dad was running the academy.
Um, my dad loved him right away as well.

1338
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,350
Uh, he stayed with my dad and,
um, you know, like once again,

1339
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:02,610
we spend a whole week on the mat together.
He's helping me.

1340
01:19:02,611 --> 01:19:07,590
He did an amazing seminar, so it was
just an amazing guy to, uh, just, uh,

1341
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:11,480
you know, he's like an encyclopedia
of Jujitsu and just, you know,

1342
01:19:11,481 --> 01:19:16,340
one of the most amazing martial
artist I've ever met. Um, and I mean,

1343
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:21,770
we just never stopped. I just
have his style in a way. They,

1344
01:19:21,771 --> 01:19:26,110
him and Changi have that
smashing. Yes. Your game.

1345
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:29,700
It's just such a hard style.
It's, I love that style. I mean,

1346
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:35,030
I love watching it. I love, I love
that. It's just a total control,

1347
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:38,250
you know, and it's just
pressure and you know, I mean,

1348
01:19:38,270 --> 01:19:40,790
everybody that I've talked to that's
rolled with him award. Sean's,

1349
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:41,950
she says it's filled out.

1350
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:44,690
You have a building on top of you
and these guys are on. Yeah, exactly.

1351
01:19:44,691 --> 01:19:47,990
Two of the greatest carb Gar Plat garp
pastors that have ever existed and there

1352
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:51,460
mountains, they smothered. They make
people tap just from their mount.

1353
01:19:51,930 --> 01:19:56,410
So do you brother. It's
suffocating. But I didn't have that.

1354
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:01,150
I was a guard guy. I didn't really a great
combination of those two things. Yeah.

1355
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:05,750
It all came together for me. Uh, but I
mean, this was a time I'm a brown belt,

1356
01:20:05,751 --> 01:20:09,090
transitioning into becoming a black belt.
The next year I get my black.

1357
01:20:09,091 --> 01:20:12,720
But when we really started training,
like day to day,

1358
01:20:12,721 --> 01:20:15,540
that that year I spent four months there.
I trained with Shawn. Did you every day,

1359
01:20:15,541 --> 01:20:20,400
you know, um, you know, I'd be, I'd become
a black belt and they're literally just,

1360
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:25,020
I mean destroying me.
You know, they were, uh,

1361
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:27,840
their home base at that
time in the U s was Toledo,

1362
01:20:27,841 --> 01:20:31,370
Ohio in the middle of
nowhere. Yes. Toledo.

1363
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:35,880
That's where their affiliates
were. And that area, uh, Michigan,

1364
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:39,960
Ohio down into Virginia.
They had a Philadelphia,

1365
01:20:39,990 --> 01:20:41,160
when did they go to San Diego?

1366
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:45,740
It was 2007 2007.
So this is like,

1367
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:47,790
this is like a training
with them down there.

1368
01:20:47,791 --> 01:20:50,840
Cause he was down there with them
for the Bj Penn fight with, yeah,

1369
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:55,290
it was before that. It was around the same
time. Oh seven. Oh eight. Really? Yes.

1370
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:59,010
Versus Diego was o seven o eight.
Yeah. Wow Man. I'm confused.

1371
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:03,330
I felt like it was like 2003 or something
like that. Um, it's um, too many fights.

1372
01:21:03,331 --> 01:21:07,050
I'm kind of rambling it. Diego Sanchez
was in the ultimate fighter. I like 2005.

1373
01:21:07,051 --> 01:21:10,890
Right. Uh, well he was in the
first season, which is all 2005.

1374
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:16,110
December 11th, 2009.
Oh, okay. Yeah. So, uh,

1375
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:21,210
I said, oh, seven, oh eight, it was
probably only doing nine, but um, yeah,

1376
01:21:21,211 --> 01:21:23,490
I mean they would just
destroy me with that pressure.

1377
01:21:23,490 --> 01:21:26,850
And it was like the exact answer
to my guard because they, you know,

1378
01:21:26,851 --> 01:21:29,920
you fight your way inside. So I
couldn't use my length. Right.

1379
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:31,650
And I didn't understand how to frame,

1380
01:21:31,651 --> 01:21:35,370
how to protect myself and I just
literally got smothered and you know,

1381
01:21:35,371 --> 01:21:39,030
just destroyed, uh, on a daily
basis. And in Toledo, Ohio,

1382
01:21:39,031 --> 01:21:40,560
it would just be the three of us,
you know,

1383
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:45,600
they didn't have like a big team and so
I would go there and stay with them and

1384
01:21:45,691 --> 01:21:49,440
we would just train for hours every day.
And the bike,

1385
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:53,730
the Airdyne bike would be the evening
training partner. Two guys were out,

1386
01:21:53,731 --> 01:21:57,810
the other guy was on the bike.
I got one of those rogue,

1387
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:02,070
a echo bikes out there.
That's the version of the airdyne.

1388
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:04,680
Holy Shit. Is that thing death? Yeah.

1389
01:22:05,010 --> 01:22:06,980
It's a lot harder to me to have
solid screaming in your ear.

1390
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:12,600
And how would you do it? Would you
do it sprints or like what do you,

1391
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:13,970
what do you do on that thing?
Uh,

1392
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:19,010
you had to keep a certain pace and
whenever they were in a scramble and going

1393
01:22:19,681 --> 01:22:22,570
hard, you had to sprint at the same
time on the bike. Oh Wow. Yeah.

1394
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:26,340
And so you didn't want to be the one
like going too slow and in the middle of

1395
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:28,230
the training solid looks
over and he's like, you know,

1396
01:22:28,231 --> 01:22:31,350
yelling at you to pick it
up. You know what I mean? So
you had, you had to push up,

1397
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:34,980
you had to push it and then it was
your turn to go in and you know,

1398
01:22:34,981 --> 01:22:39,600
so I'm going back to back between Salo
in Changi and the Airdyne and the air

1399
01:22:39,601 --> 01:22:41,270
dyne.
Those were,

1400
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:44,010
those were some good times that's in
the living room or something like that.

1401
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:45,780
Or was that Mark Lehman and stuff?

1402
01:22:45,890 --> 01:22:48,900
That was the layman just mats
in the living room at the house.

1403
01:22:49,060 --> 01:22:50,560
[inaudible] appreciated guy.

1404
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:54,210
Very much layman's Goddamn
encyclopedia of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

1405
01:22:54,211 --> 01:22:58,980
I remember he had everything sort of
written out like way back in the day.

1406
01:22:58,981 --> 01:23:03,150
Like most people just had moves in their
head. But Layman had things written up,

1407
01:23:03,170 --> 01:23:07,000
thinking might've done it on his computer.
Yeah. It was on his computer. Yeah. Uh,

1408
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:09,730
another guy though,
it had a big influence on me is he,

1409
01:23:09,731 --> 01:23:12,570
these days he went back home to Wisconsin.
Right.

1410
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:14,910
And I think he might have a
school there now. I think he's,

1411
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:17,160
I know he was doing team
take down, right. Yeah.

1412
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:21,490
He was with hydro twice when Hendrix was
that his best. Yeah. You that's right.

1413
01:23:21,491 --> 01:23:24,680
You were there as well. And then
I haven't heard from him. I was,

1414
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:28,600
I was wondering like, yeah, he went back
home. He's had some back issues, you know,

1415
01:23:28,601 --> 01:23:32,170
that kept it from training. But I think,
I want to say I heard he is teaching now.

1416
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:36,160
He is back to the teachers teaching and I
think he's also, uh, some of his family.

1417
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:40,240
Either it's a bait and tackle
shop or maybe it's like, uh, uh,

1418
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:43,120
the standing paddle boards or
something like that on a lake.

1419
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:45,700
And I think he's helping with
that business as well too.

1420
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,740
So his back from Jujitsu.
Right. I think that's, yeah,

1421
01:23:50,770 --> 01:23:54,700
that's where his same number one
injury that fucks people up in Jujitsu.

1422
01:23:54,701 --> 01:23:57,940
It is the back right back,
neck, upper back and neck.

1423
01:23:58,180 --> 01:23:59,830
Have you had any of those problems?

1424
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:04,240
I used to have some neck issues.
Uh,

1425
01:24:04,630 --> 01:24:06,880
you know,
it wasn't ever anything too serious,

1426
01:24:06,881 --> 01:24:10,140
but if there was something that kept me
from training for a week or two, it'd be,

1427
01:24:10,150 --> 01:24:12,640
becomes my neck would flare up.
Um,

1428
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:17,530
but fortunately my strength conditioning
coach that I've been with now for about

1429
01:24:17,531 --> 01:24:22,300
nine years, um, he really changed the
way I trained. I used to think that,

1430
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:24,880
you know, the supplementary like
strength conditioning type stuff.

1431
01:24:24,881 --> 01:24:29,881
Like I had to just destroy myself and
lift hard and do all this crazy stuff and

1432
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:33,950
I didn't feel like it was productive and
less, I couldn't walk at the end. Uh,

1433
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:37,690
and then I would go train and get hurt.
You know, I just, I couldn't move.

1434
01:24:37,691 --> 01:24:42,160
I was too tight, too sore.
And so my strength and
conditioning coach, Luke Tyree,

1435
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:43,053
um,

1436
01:24:43,090 --> 01:24:48,090
he really kind of put me on a different
path and made it a lot more back to the

1437
01:24:49,511 --> 01:24:52,630
basics,
pure clean movement and everything.

1438
01:24:52,631 --> 01:24:57,340
Just about health and awareness. A lot of,
uh, so what kind of stuff do you do now?

1439
01:24:58,450 --> 01:25:02,050
Well, you'd be surprised how little
I do. Um, you know, and I don't,

1440
01:25:02,610 --> 01:25:06,000
there are times where we
push it, but I, I don't, uh,

1441
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,980
I don't ever leave feeling like I'm
not going to be able to train later.

1442
01:25:08,981 --> 01:25:12,550
You know, I actually, a lot of people
do strength conditioning type training,

1443
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:13,750
you know,

1444
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:17,710
later in the day after they've already
done their martial arts training. So they,

1445
01:25:17,890 --> 01:25:20,830
you know, don't feel tired when
they do their martial arts training.

1446
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:25,750
The strength conditioning training than
I do actually makes me feel healthier.

1447
01:25:25,751 --> 01:25:29,610
It makes me feel kind of awakens
my body. I feel looser. And so I,

1448
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:34,270
I was doing in the morning, um, that's
the way I like to start all my days.

1449
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:38,590
Um, but, uh, you know, we, we
do a lot of kettle bells. Uh,

1450
01:25:38,591 --> 01:25:41,840
I've been playing a lot with
the mace lately as well. Um,

1451
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:46,630
I do a lot of Airdyne bike. I'm
on the bike a lot. A sled, rags,

1452
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:50,980
you know, we just pick heavy things up
and moving around, you know, um, uh, the,

1453
01:25:50,990 --> 01:25:55,310
you only lift I really do on
a regular basis somewhat, um,

1454
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:59,800
is dead lifts, uh, with the
trap bar so it's safer. Um,

1455
01:25:59,830 --> 01:26:04,370
and there was just also a lot of movement,
a lot of mobility involved.

1456
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,250
Why is dead lifts safer with a trap bar?
Uh,

1457
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:09,680
cause you're not carrying the weight
in front of you so it's not as much

1458
01:26:09,681 --> 01:26:13,040
pressure on your back,
you know. Um, it's, it's,

1459
01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:16,070
you're kind of inside of it and so it's
a little more natural to bring it up.

1460
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:20,020
What's that other machine that Luke had
is that you also love, it's the, uh,

1461
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:23,330
the reverse hyper first cyber
things amazing for your back,

1462
01:26:23,331 --> 01:26:27,010
isn't it so critical
for decompressing the,

1463
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:30,860
compressing your spine and
then strengthening up all
that area and a real weird

1464
01:26:30,861 --> 01:26:33,620
way that's very difficult to
do outside of that machine.

1465
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:37,700
And here's the first one that just
say crawl. Why don't you, you know,

1466
01:26:37,701 --> 01:26:42,500
he taught me how to crawl and, you know,
just start crawling for five minutes,

1467
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:46,460
10 minutes, hang, you know, get on the
pullup bar. Hank. You know, we, we,

1468
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:49,430
he would incorporate all these recovery,
uh,

1469
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:53,180
techniques and exercises into my training
and a lot of movement and would be the

1470
01:26:53,181 --> 01:26:56,060
first one to say, ah, I know you
want to go this heart today, but no,

1471
01:26:56,210 --> 01:27:00,470
you're going to tone it down. How are
you feeling? What's on your schedule?

1472
01:27:00,471 --> 01:27:03,650
You know, and really just, you know,

1473
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:06,490
put it to where it fits
nicely into my routine and,

1474
01:27:06,491 --> 01:27:10,220
and isn't something that is everything,
you know, that takes it all out of me.

1475
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:15,440
And he kind of opened my eyes to the
movement area, um, of his training.

1476
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:20,300
Um, and that kind of led me into another
person I'm training with now these days.

1477
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:24,770
His name is Cameron Shane, uh, who's, uh,
an innovator when it comes to movement.

1478
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:29,780
Uh, he has, um, uh, a system,
the boot con, a movement system,

1479
01:27:30,050 --> 01:27:34,910
and he's an incredible guy. He's in
Florida, in Miami. Um, and he is,

1480
01:27:34,911 --> 01:27:37,970
uh, uh, Yoga, you know,
as a, as a Yogi. He,

1481
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:42,320
he's a martial artist first fell in love
with yoga and then created this free

1482
01:27:42,321 --> 01:27:47,321
form mobility and movement that you see
guys like ido portal preaching and doing

1483
01:27:47,961 --> 01:27:51,670
now. It was a really well known
for his work with Connor. Um,

1484
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,090
and I'm really into that as well.

1485
01:27:53,150 --> 01:27:58,150
And so I've been working with him now
for a year and I love that movement.

1486
01:27:59,211 --> 01:27:59,791
I just love it.

1487
01:27:59,791 --> 01:28:03,540
And it's all when Shawn g are also that
they spend a lot of time with Algebra

1488
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:08,520
Hoomana from Genesco naturale
so, yeah, exactly. Exactly.

1489
01:28:08,521 --> 01:28:10,790
Yeah. So I, I love Yoga.

1490
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:14,570
I love movement and that's a
big part of my recovery. Um,

1491
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:17,720
and training without impact, you know, um,

1492
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:22,460
and it's kind of implemented into my
strength and conditioning program as well.

1493
01:28:22,850 --> 01:28:26,060
So you're conditioning
program used to be just,

1494
01:28:26,330 --> 01:28:30,710
was it you on your own or was it someone
else that was like brutalizing you?

1495
01:28:31,210 --> 01:28:33,370
A little bit of both.
Um,

1496
01:28:33,530 --> 01:28:38,530
and it was just hardcore go full blast
and try to build your strength up and

1497
01:28:40,011 --> 01:28:43,840
break your body down. But yes, while
you're doing Brazilian Jujitsu,

1498
01:28:43,930 --> 01:28:45,900
it's not really the best
way to do it. Yeah, I was,

1499
01:28:45,901 --> 01:28:50,810
I was 100% like going for all the major
tournaments in Brazilian Jujitsu at that

1500
01:28:50,811 --> 01:28:54,110
time and I would kill myself
in strength conditioning.

1501
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:58,520
Go to train neck, we get jacked up. Do
you ever fuck around with that iron neck?

1502
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:02,640
Have you used that before? Is that
like a halo? Yeah. Yeah. I've seen it,

1503
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:05,730
but I have one here. You got to try
it. Yeah, it looks easy. I'd love to.

1504
01:29:05,790 --> 01:29:08,370
It's one of the best things ever
for strengthening your neck.

1505
01:29:08,371 --> 01:29:12,720
And I've heard you talk about it. I love
it. The decompressing on the, the hangs,

1506
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:16,740
you know, those are great as well. Yeah.
More people should be doing that, right?

1507
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:20,070
Yeah, it was great. It hangs from a
chin up bar to where your shoulders,

1508
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:24,840
it's just great to just, uh, so
what you're basically following,

1509
01:29:24,841 --> 01:29:28,830
it was just like a, a protocol
where you're not going to failure,

1510
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:32,370
you just strengthening things up and you
probably doing like more workouts but

1511
01:29:32,371 --> 01:29:35,970
less time. Yes, exactly. A lot of
people were leaning towards that.

1512
01:29:35,971 --> 01:29:40,710
Now I do something every
day, Monday through Friday,
and then Saturday is like a,

1513
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:44,040
a long, hard training
day, uh, in the mornings.

1514
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:47,520
And then Sundays is like a yoga recovery
day. That's the other thing. Luke,

1515
01:29:47,521 --> 01:29:50,400
tell me about his active recovery.
You know, I used to think, well,

1516
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:53,760
I need to take a day off, I need a
rest. And I would basically lay around,

1517
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:56,010
you know, and I thought that
was helping and it wasn't,

1518
01:29:56,310 --> 01:29:59,160
he was the first one to really give
me the accurate active recovery.

1519
01:29:59,161 --> 01:30:04,050
Like go take an hour long walk,
you know, uh, stretch, move,

1520
01:30:04,051 --> 01:30:08,830
breathe, do yoga, you know, something
like that. And that helps tremendously to,

1521
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:13,560
um, I, I don't get to a level of soreness
anymore where I feel like I can't do

1522
01:30:13,561 --> 01:30:16,690
anything, you know? Whereas
that used to happen to me. Um,

1523
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:21,120
but I was younger and I had
this stubborn mindset and,

1524
01:30:21,121 --> 01:30:24,930
and I just thought, well, no,
I got to go, go, go, go. And
you think you're doing well,

1525
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:28,640
you're pushing hard, and you think that
that's really the way to do it. Yeah,

1526
01:30:28,650 --> 01:30:30,960
it was just the harder you
push the strong yield cat,

1527
01:30:30,961 --> 01:30:35,010
it's just all about overcoming
weakness in your mind. Yeah, exactly.

1528
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:36,750
You had that thing in the
back of your mind where like,

1529
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:41,160
what if the other guy's doing more,
you know, I gotta go hard today.

1530
01:30:41,190 --> 01:30:45,330
I've always wondered how many fighters
ruined themselves before they get to the

1531
01:30:45,331 --> 01:30:49,380
fight because they just overtrain.
I think it's a real common,

1532
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:54,710
and I think you can get to a level of
spectacular strength and conditioning.

1533
01:30:55,290 --> 01:30:58,050
You can get there, but it's not
something you're going to get to.

1534
01:30:58,051 --> 01:31:00,330
And in a two month camp,
you know,

1535
01:31:00,331 --> 01:31:03,690
and I wonder how many guys are coming
into camp where they're not in the best

1536
01:31:03,691 --> 01:31:07,380
shape and you're just pushing it so
hard during camp that by the time those

1537
01:31:07,381 --> 01:31:11,460
eight weeks are dumb, they're fucking
worn out man. Yeah. And they take,

1538
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:15,270
they taper off the last week or so,
but it probably isn't enough. Yeah.

1539
01:31:15,271 --> 01:31:19,860
It's gotta be a lifestyle. Yeah. 100%
has to be a lifestyle. The way you eat,

1540
01:31:19,861 --> 01:31:20,970
your move,
you breathe,

1541
01:31:21,930 --> 01:31:25,530
the way you view your training
and you're saying sled drags.

1542
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:27,810
So you're putting a harness on
and dragging the sled behind you.

1543
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:32,440
Are you pushing the sled? Uh,
yeah. I mean both harness, um,

1544
01:31:32,550 --> 01:31:36,860
that's maybe around your waist or you
can, you know, hold like a, you know,

1545
01:31:36,870 --> 01:31:41,670
some handles and push it, pull it
or are you doing any running at all?

1546
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:43,610
He'll sprint.
Uh,

1547
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:47,640
I don't do like a lot of long distance
extended period of time running, uh,

1548
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:48,570
just hill sprints.

1549
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:53,220
I feel like that's the easiest on my body
and also translates the most into what

1550
01:31:53,221 --> 01:31:54,054
I need.

1551
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:59,060
And you decided Justin to go down to
Oklahoma to train with him and you moved

1552
01:31:59,561 --> 01:32:00,160
there.
What,

1553
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:03,910
what, what caused that move? Like what
was the motivation behind it? Honestly,

1554
01:32:04,090 --> 01:32:07,340
it was a couple of things. Um,
there's some really great people,

1555
01:32:07,390 --> 01:32:09,490
my sports agents out of Oklahoma City,

1556
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,740
my business manager is
out of Oklahoma City.

1557
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:15,050
I'm an organization we partner
with is out of Oklahoma City. Um,

1558
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:19,930
and then water for, yeah. Yeah,
they're out of there. Um, and then,

1559
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:22,590
uh, Jessica was out of their company
that I'm a spokesperson for it.

1560
01:32:22,591 --> 01:32:26,380
But then the thing that was the
deciding factor, my wife and I,

1561
01:32:26,660 --> 01:32:27,790
we watched a,

1562
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:31,480
if anyone's got a flow grappling
subscription where you need to go get one,

1563
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:36,850
because they did a documentary on
Rafael and it's called the American. Um,

1564
01:32:36,851 --> 01:32:40,120
and it's his life story, his life journey.
And he gets to see how hard he works.

1565
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:44,110
You get to hear all the history.
Um, but then to me it was like,

1566
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:45,670
this guy's like a Modern Day Samurai.

1567
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:50,110
And then whenever I went down and trained
with them, uh, it was suffocating.

1568
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:55,140
And I've trained with Shane Carwyn and
frank mir and Randy couture and all sorts

1569
01:32:55,421 --> 01:32:58,780
of big heavyweights that are
known for being so much pressure.

1570
01:32:58,930 --> 01:33:02,820
I've never been claustrophobic under any
person in my entire life except Raphael.

1571
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:05,200
And it just feels like,
like you said,

1572
01:33:05,201 --> 01:33:10,201
a building or like this building of melted
hot no cheese or blanket that's going

1573
01:33:10,331 --> 01:33:14,710
over your face. And she's, she's,
yeah, no, it sounds cheesy saying that,

1574
01:33:14,711 --> 01:33:15,251
but it's just like,

1575
01:33:15,251 --> 01:33:19,870
it's melted all over you and you can't
get them off and you'd take inch by inch

1576
01:33:19,871 --> 01:33:22,150
by inch.
And I have a good wrestling game,

1577
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:25,420
but I wanted to get my Jujitsu there
where every time I take someone down I'm

1578
01:33:25,421 --> 01:33:26,254
going to finish them.

1579
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:29,050
And I've done that in
fighting statistically every
flight of taking him to the

1580
01:33:29,051 --> 01:33:29,884
ground to finish.

1581
01:33:29,950 --> 01:33:33,670
But I wanted to get even more proficient
at that and just seeing the way that he,

1582
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:37,060
he coaches, he teaches.
Um, honestly, like I've,

1583
01:33:37,150 --> 01:33:42,130
I've been coached by Cael Sanderson
and kindle cross and Kenny Monday, um,

1584
01:33:42,150 --> 01:33:45,670
a Olympic gold medalist and
wrestling, um, fantastic people,

1585
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:47,740
amazing coaches.
Um,

1586
01:33:47,770 --> 01:33:50,950
there's something really special and
different about the way he teaches and

1587
01:33:50,951 --> 01:33:54,100
coaches, um, that you really
start to grasp everything.

1588
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:58,450
He breaks it down bit by bit,
inch by inch.

1589
01:33:59,470 --> 01:34:03,790
I mean the way that he will because
he's an active competitor too.

1590
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:07,200
And he's a great teacher. I mean,
when did you start teaching Raphael?

1591
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:10,370
I mean you were in high school probably,
right? Yeah, yeah, because it was just,

1592
01:34:10,371 --> 01:34:10,480
yeah,

1593
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:13,300
my dad and I, uh, in Oklahoma, you know,

1594
01:34:13,301 --> 01:34:17,110
I was the most advanced
student there, you know, uh,

1595
01:34:17,170 --> 01:34:21,190
and so I started helping my dad teach
when I was like 16, you know, if he,

1596
01:34:21,191 --> 01:34:22,600
if he wanted to go travel and train,

1597
01:34:22,601 --> 01:34:26,850
I would help teach if you needed a night
off or whatever. Um, I was sort of the,

1598
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:30,700
the next one and I started teaching
adults, uh, right off the bat, you know,

1599
01:34:30,710 --> 01:34:34,990
I'm 16 years old and I'm
teaching grown men, but, um, I,

1600
01:34:34,991 --> 01:34:36,650
I've been treating
teaching now for almost 20,

1601
01:34:36,940 --> 01:34:40,570
and then there's things that I'm doing
and he'll say, turn an inch this way.

1602
01:34:40,990 --> 01:34:44,230
I'm just an inch.
And I turned an inch and I hear my,

1603
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:46,790
the guy I'm trained with the,

1604
01:34:47,170 --> 01:34:50,410
and it's just a small little
inch of an adjustment. Um,

1605
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:54,310
get your chest up high or get, you know,
finish this way, your chest down low.

1606
01:34:54,370 --> 01:34:58,100
I mean, the, and I can
hear him very distinctly.

1607
01:34:58,190 --> 01:35:01,100
Um, whenever I'm training,
whenever I'm competing,
whenever I was in my last fight,

1608
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:05,000
um, I can hear everything he's saying
too. And so in a, in a trust it,

1609
01:35:05,001 --> 01:35:08,090
so there's this level of trust that,
that, um, I don't know why it's there,

1610
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:11,900
but you're just a fantastic human
being and make some, this guy,

1611
01:35:11,901 --> 01:35:16,430
this guy blew me away. He's, he's been
such a blessing in my life and you know,

1612
01:35:16,431 --> 01:35:20,510
I was very kind of like skeptical of
him at first, just because, you know,

1613
01:35:20,511 --> 01:35:23,960
he's a big guy, heavyweight
MMA fighters like, man,

1614
01:35:23,961 --> 01:35:28,040
is how is this going to work? Is he
going to be open to putting on the Geeky?

1615
01:35:28,041 --> 01:35:32,810
What is his mindset? Is He,
is he a fighter? Is he a
martial artists? You know,

1616
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:36,800
how's, I just didn't know how it was
going to work, you know? Uh, I'm not, uh,

1617
01:35:37,310 --> 01:35:42,140
we don't have a fight team, you know what
I mean? We have a martial arts school.

1618
01:35:42,370 --> 01:35:46,020
Um, and so you're always just
a little, you know, when,

1619
01:35:46,030 --> 01:35:49,560
when a fighter wants to come and, you
know, how's this going to work? Yeah.

1620
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:53,240
Some of them are a little rough around
the edges that's saying it lightly.

1621
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:56,350
And especially when you
have kids in classes. Right.

1622
01:35:56,810 --> 01:35:59,480
But of course don't have anything to do
with fighting. They just want to learn.

1623
01:35:59,690 --> 01:36:04,120
Right. And that's the most important
thing. Just learning. Um, and,

1624
01:36:04,121 --> 01:36:07,580
and becoming part of the
team, part of the family. Uh,

1625
01:36:07,581 --> 01:36:10,290
of course I did my research
on Jocelyn and, you know,

1626
01:36:10,410 --> 01:36:13,160
I knew he was an amazing person, but I
just didn't know what he trained, like,

1627
01:36:13,161 --> 01:36:17,480
what his energy was like inside
the academy, you know. But, uh,

1628
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:20,690
he was open to putting on the
gate the first conversation
we had. I said, hey man,

1629
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:24,050
you know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna want to
put a g on you. Are you okay with that?

1630
01:36:24,510 --> 01:36:28,490
It's so critical for you about the game
for me.

1631
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:32,340
I can't pass on what I,
what,

1632
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:35,960
what I really have to offer,
you know, my passion, my love.

1633
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:39,350
There's no way I'm going to be able to
pass that on to you if you don't put on

1634
01:36:39,351 --> 01:36:42,870
the key,
if you don't get inside my head and,

1635
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:46,580
and learn what I have to say and
how I feel about Brazilian Jujitsu.

1636
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:50,750
But what is specifically why the g,
it's just a,

1637
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:55,520
for me that's Jujitsu. Like for
me that is Jujitsu. Nogi is,

1638
01:36:55,730 --> 01:37:00,080
Jujitsu is a part of it,
but it's, it's submission,
wrestling, submission, grappling,

1639
01:37:00,081 --> 01:37:04,310
you know, uh, the, the beauty
of Jujitsu for me is with the g,

1640
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:07,490
um, the, the inches, the details,

1641
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:12,260
the way you can make a mistake
here and that's your downfall. 10,

1642
01:37:12,261 --> 01:37:17,090
12 moves later, you know, minutes
later the way it feels, you know,

1643
01:37:17,091 --> 01:37:22,040
the tightness of it, everything.
Jujitsu is, you know, I mean,

1644
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:26,540
I just use my passion. For me, I feel
like whenever I put on the Geeky,

1645
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:30,670
it was tough. I didn't want
to put it on a, but then, um,

1646
01:37:30,710 --> 01:37:33,800
whenever I did and it was just tough
because I couldn't power out of stuff.

1647
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:37,610
And then slip out of things. That's
the big factor. Yeah. And so for me,

1648
01:37:37,611 --> 01:37:42,611
it's helped expand my knowledge of
every position you have to be for me,

1649
01:37:44,470 --> 01:37:48,860
uh, and learn from him. Um,
it's, it's both are technical,

1650
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:53,540
but there's one that seems a little bit
like maybe you expand your knowledge and

1651
01:37:53,541 --> 01:37:58,060
then whenever you, um,
take it off, I feel like I,

1652
01:37:58,140 --> 01:38:01,830
I feel like I understand the Nogi
positions a little bit better,

1653
01:38:01,890 --> 01:38:06,330
a little bit more that more refined, more
refined, more refined. That's the word.

1654
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:06,870
Yeah.

1655
01:38:06,870 --> 01:38:10,230
It's like a gallon is a friction because
of the fact that people can grab you.

1656
01:38:10,830 --> 01:38:15,120
You have to slow it down,
slow it down and truly understand it.

1657
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,400
I feel like before I was
able to muscle out of things,

1658
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:21,300
I was able to slip out of things, is
able to use my weight a lot more. Um,

1659
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:23,760
and I still get to use that
whenever I take the g off.

1660
01:38:23,950 --> 01:38:25,040
And whenever I'm in the Geeky,

1661
01:38:25,050 --> 01:38:29,010
it's to learn and it's to really expand
my knowledge base base, the depth of it.

1662
01:38:29,011 --> 01:38:32,280
That's what it was too.
It's like, you know, uh,

1663
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:36,720
you're not going to fully become part
of the team and the family if you're not

1664
01:38:36,721 --> 01:38:39,620
in the classes. You know. And
like I was saying, you know,

1665
01:38:39,630 --> 01:38:41,490
I'm going to want you to do
the classes in [inaudible].

1666
01:38:41,491 --> 01:38:46,440
98% of my classes are all in the
geek. Um, you know, we take it off.

1667
01:38:46,441 --> 01:38:50,370
We, we, we do Gnocchi
afterwards. You know, we have
our sparring or MMA training,

1668
01:38:50,371 --> 01:38:54,000
everything else, but I want
you to come to class, you know,

1669
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:58,640
I'm not going to do like a lot of special
treatment just for one individual and

1670
01:38:58,641 --> 01:38:59,474
you need to,
you know,

1671
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:04,410
be a part of this family and that is
to put the key on and come to Jujitsu

1672
01:39:04,411 --> 01:39:05,910
class.
Um,

1673
01:39:06,170 --> 01:39:10,260
he had a lot of other guys
who are professional fighters
come and specifically

1674
01:39:10,261 --> 01:39:13,110
come down to train with
you like this. No, no, no.

1675
01:39:13,111 --> 01:39:16,020
Oklahoma's not like that sort of hot spot.
You know what I mean?

1676
01:39:16,021 --> 01:39:17,400
It's rare for people to come.

1677
01:39:17,401 --> 01:39:20,790
And he told me it made sense
that he was going down there.

1678
01:39:20,791 --> 01:39:23,910
And then when I saw the results,
as soon as I saw that one fight,

1679
01:39:23,911 --> 01:39:27,840
will you a mount of that guy
and got an arm triangle? I
go, well, there you go. Yup.

1680
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:29,570
Yeah.
I mean now you're finishing from the top.

1681
01:39:29,571 --> 01:39:31,560
It's not just punching a guy
when you're on top of them.

1682
01:39:31,580 --> 01:39:35,650
Now you strangling people. Yeah. And
then he learns like a sponge. I mean, he,

1683
01:39:36,090 --> 01:39:36,923
he's,

1684
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:41,100
because of that attitude that he has and
our connection that we made so quickly,

1685
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:44,880
uh, it made it really easy for me. And
I mean, obviously it's a great athlete,

1686
01:39:44,881 --> 01:39:49,440
great wrestler. Um, and the fact
that he was open to it, you know,

1687
01:39:50,030 --> 01:39:53,430
I mean, I was telling like, Justin,
you've got to play guard. You know,

1688
01:39:53,431 --> 01:39:55,200
you're going to start on your back.
Like all these things.

1689
01:39:55,380 --> 01:39:59,070
He was accepting of it and then he
just made it so easy to absorb all the

1690
01:39:59,071 --> 01:40:02,190
knowledge. And it's just like, you know,
playing a video game with him. It's like,

1691
01:40:02,210 --> 01:40:04,170
here's what you're gonna
do, and boom, he did it.

1692
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:06,480
What a wrestler falls in
love with Jujitsu. I mean,

1693
01:40:06,481 --> 01:40:09,750
you already have this ability to
manipulate bodies that it sets such a high

1694
01:40:09,751 --> 01:40:13,050
level and the strength that
wrestlers have. But so many of them,

1695
01:40:13,051 --> 01:40:17,970
for whatever reason, never make that leap.
It's uncomfortable. It's uncomfortable.

1696
01:40:18,090 --> 01:40:20,220
Uh, going to your back is not, I mean,

1697
01:40:20,221 --> 01:40:24,750
you've been trained your whole life not
to go to your back. And so to do that,

1698
01:40:24,780 --> 01:40:28,150
go to guard, um, to have
someone put you in a,

1699
01:40:28,230 --> 01:40:29,610
you're not supposed to be getting pinned.

1700
01:40:29,850 --> 01:40:32,850
You're supposed to be turning
your back and getting up. Uh, but,

1701
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:34,950
but getting comfortable with your back,
just flat on the Mat,

1702
01:40:34,951 --> 01:40:37,170
but then getting into your side because
you understand that you're just gonna

1703
01:40:37,171 --> 01:40:38,790
get smashed and smash and smashed if your,

1704
01:40:39,050 --> 01:40:40,980
if your shoulders are
flat against the back,

1705
01:40:41,230 --> 01:40:45,850
you catch and triangles and doing things.
He's got a good Omoplata man, don't,

1706
01:40:47,690 --> 01:40:51,480
yeah. You to have flexibility.
I think I do for having,

1707
01:40:51,481 --> 01:40:54,100
he's been working with a strength
conditioning too. I mean, he's kind

1708
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:57,640
of gone all in with
everything. Uh, his, his,

1709
01:40:58,120 --> 01:41:02,500
his regimen is kind of becoming mine.
I, I, I'm inspired by it. Um, but yeah,

1710
01:41:02,501 --> 01:41:05,230
I've got, I've got a normal plotter.
The triangles, little harder. I got to,

1711
01:41:05,290 --> 01:41:08,480
I got small legs where heavyweight
short, short legs, they're thick.

1712
01:41:09,510 --> 01:41:12,930
So why? Okay. Okay.

1713
01:41:13,180 --> 01:41:16,960
I only wear like a 30 inch inseam or
whatever, 30 inches long or three,

1714
01:41:17,350 --> 01:41:20,950
it's either 30 or 32. So instead of, I
think most heavyweights were like 34,

1715
01:41:20,951 --> 01:41:25,600
36 different things like that.
So in short, torsos really long,

1716
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:27,200
the doctor told me that, uh, uh,

1717
01:41:27,370 --> 01:41:31,920
if I didn't have short legs I'd be
like six foot seven. So yeah. Um,

1718
01:41:31,990 --> 01:41:35,230
but yeah, I got short little legs
and just coming in the academy,

1719
01:41:35,231 --> 01:41:36,760
it's been really great, you know, um,

1720
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:41,230
I came in and was really wanting
to be coached and I wanted to be,

1721
01:41:41,350 --> 01:41:44,650
have a mindset of being coachable and
it just absorbing everything he teaches.

1722
01:41:44,980 --> 01:41:46,780
But then on the flip side,
uh,

1723
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:51,810
last year we had like this holiday break
Christmas party and a rough Hale said,

1724
01:41:53,650 --> 01:41:57,040
you know, what if we could like transform
a community, uh, with clean water?

1725
01:41:57,041 --> 01:42:00,370
And so what if we like set a goal at
reasoning? And what does that cost?

1726
01:42:00,371 --> 01:42:03,400
And it was like, man, it's like
$4,200. And he's like, man,

1727
01:42:03,401 --> 01:42:07,900
let's set a crowdfunding campaign
and let's, let's do it. And, uh,

1728
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:12,580
hosted a party. Um, and we
were able to raise 14,000,

1729
01:42:12,581 --> 01:42:17,080
$400, um, through the academy.
And the, the team just came
around it and said, hey,

1730
01:42:17,380 --> 01:42:20,440
we're going to, this is your passion.
You're sharing in our passion.

1731
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:23,670
Like we're going to, we're going to do
something great in the community, um, in,

1732
01:42:23,671 --> 01:42:26,630
in the world. And so
that's been great. Um,

1733
01:42:26,650 --> 01:42:29,080
Rafael and I are partnering again.

1734
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:33,650
We are getting ready to
launch a nationwide through
fight for the forgotten to

1735
01:42:33,651 --> 01:42:38,180
nationwide bullying prevention, a campaign
and curriculum. Uh, I grew up, uh,

1736
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:39,550
getting very heavily,

1737
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:45,250
like really extensively on the podcast
is terrible stories and it made me,

1738
01:42:45,730 --> 01:42:49,660
uh, and, and so this last year, um,
I got injured at a shoulder surgery.

1739
01:42:50,030 --> 01:42:54,510
I got Mesenchymal stem cells in their
MSC stem cells. I'm getting better. Uh,

1740
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:57,350
hopefully I'll fight, uh, first quarter.
When did you get your shoulders?

1741
01:42:58,390 --> 01:43:03,040
So I got it in like late March, um,
labor them. Uh, but it was actually,

1742
01:43:03,610 --> 01:43:08,230
yeah, Lieberman, rotator cuff I think,
but my rotator cuff was just fine.

1743
01:43:08,710 --> 01:43:12,830
Um, and it's kept me out for a while,
but the whole time I've been, um,

1744
01:43:12,910 --> 01:43:14,930
and it was actually after
being on the podcast last time,

1745
01:43:14,931 --> 01:43:17,290
I'm talking about bullying. It's
like, how can we make a difference?

1746
01:43:17,291 --> 01:43:21,430
And there was such a response from
the Jerry like community saying,

1747
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:23,590
let's do something here that also,

1748
01:43:23,650 --> 01:43:26,740
let's make a difference here in the
United States of bullying. How can you,

1749
01:43:27,010 --> 01:43:28,930
how can you prevent billing pulling?
What do you think?

1750
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:31,900
I've always said that one of the best
ways is teach people to actually fight.

1751
01:43:32,170 --> 01:43:33,010
Yeah. I think that, well,

1752
01:43:33,011 --> 01:43:36,280
a lot of bullies are hugely insecure
and if they just learned how to fight,

1753
01:43:36,281 --> 01:43:38,530
they wouldn't act like
that. Right. I think,

1754
01:43:38,531 --> 01:43:42,470
I think martial arts is going to be a
tool. So what we want to do this year is,

1755
01:43:42,710 --> 01:43:45,970
is to get into a hundred
martial arts academies, um,

1756
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,650
with a bullying prevention curriculum.

1757
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:53,080
A lot of people don't know that 100,000
kids in the United States alone,

1758
01:43:54,230 --> 01:43:58,280
160,000 kids every day. Skip School,
skip school because of bullying.

1759
01:43:58,700 --> 01:44:03,230
That's 3 million school days last a year,
or sorry, a month, 3 million school days,

1760
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:04,093
lost a month.

1761
01:44:04,310 --> 01:44:09,310
And then I started digging into it because
Oklahoma's become home now and like

1762
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:13,250
28.9% of the students deal with
depression that's debilitating.

1763
01:44:13,250 --> 01:44:17,840
That affects them for two weeks or more
school. I mean depression, addiction,

1764
01:44:17,930 --> 01:44:21,350
suicides in school, shootings are
all through the roof. And you know,

1765
01:44:21,410 --> 01:44:23,570
the suicide rate that you said,
so,

1766
01:44:23,650 --> 01:44:28,070
so insane in Oklahoma fit
that says the at risk youth,

1767
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:32,690
um,
behavior survey and they say that 15.4 no,

1768
01:44:32,691 --> 01:44:36,740
15.1% of the students are d
dealing with suicidal ideation,

1769
01:44:36,770 --> 01:44:38,450
like seriously considering suicide.

1770
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:43,400
And then 7.4 7.4% of the
students had attempted suicide,

1771
01:44:43,970 --> 01:44:45,620
attempted it.
I was one of those kids.

1772
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:49,730
I was one of those kids in that seven
out of a hundred kids have attempted

1773
01:44:49,731 --> 01:44:51,500
suicide just in Oklahoma
schools. And that, that,

1774
01:44:51,770 --> 01:44:54,890
that goes around the country
to around that 6%, 8%.

1775
01:44:55,130 --> 01:45:00,130
I was on a bullying prevention summit
in San Antonio with congressmen or US

1776
01:45:01,161 --> 01:45:02,330
Representative Will Hurd.

1777
01:45:02,570 --> 01:45:06,290
He brought me in to speak with
Maureen Molech and Maureen. Um,

1778
01:45:06,410 --> 01:45:09,440
she has a foundation
called David's legacy.

1779
01:45:09,530 --> 01:45:14,030
She started it because her son in San
Antonio was getting ridiculed in cyber

1780
01:45:14,031 --> 01:45:16,460
bullied relentlessly. You know,
whenever we were growing up,

1781
01:45:16,490 --> 01:45:18,830
bullying would end at 3:00 PM.
Right, because you're out of school.

1782
01:45:19,070 --> 01:45:23,390
But now it just increases because kids
aren't in school, they aren't in class.

1783
01:45:24,160 --> 01:45:27,260
So that's whenever they can really
take off and start bullying. Well,

1784
01:45:27,261 --> 01:45:31,250
David had over 300 comments of people,
uh,

1785
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:33,620
that were just brutally
cyberbullying them.

1786
01:45:33,830 --> 01:45:37,430
A ton of them are calling for a suicide.
Um, it went on for weeks and weeks.

1787
01:45:37,431 --> 01:45:41,210
They moved them from schools.
He attempted suicide and at once or twice,

1788
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:44,870
but his third time, his third
time, you're successful. Um,

1789
01:45:45,260 --> 01:45:50,200
and I'm very proud of Maureen. Uh,
very proud of her because she, um,

1790
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:55,410
got a law passed called David's law.
David's law is about cyberbullying. Uh,

1791
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:58,460
we want to see if we can get that
into Oklahoma. What is the law?

1792
01:45:58,850 --> 01:46:03,460
So the law basically Maureen's family
was told basically at school, um, they,

1793
01:46:03,530 --> 01:46:06,770
the school was good to them.
They were trying to make a difference,

1794
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:09,800
but they're basically saying their hands
were tied, their hands are tied from,

1795
01:46:09,830 --> 01:46:13,520
from doing anything about it because it
was an overwhelming response of students.

1796
01:46:13,521 --> 01:46:17,810
I mean 300 students, and then it was
off school property and it was online.

1797
01:46:18,140 --> 01:46:21,110
So there they said their
hands are tied. Well now, um,

1798
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:25,430
the law basically brings into the fact
that law enforcement and the schools can

1799
01:46:25,431 --> 01:46:29,450
get involved off the school campus and
they can look into the cyber bulling and

1800
01:46:29,451 --> 01:46:33,560
they can take action against
it. So it basically just
means, hey, this is serious.

1801
01:46:34,010 --> 01:46:37,210
Um, and, and, and it's not okay. Um,

1802
01:46:37,211 --> 01:46:39,050
and we're going to stand up and
do something about it. Texas, I'm,

1803
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:43,130
I'm proud of Texas. That's my home
state. Um, they passed it 33 to zero.

1804
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:46,370
No one voted against it. Um,
and it's really great. We're,

1805
01:46:46,371 --> 01:46:51,030
we're working with a state representative
named Collin. I'm in Oklahoma.

1806
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:56,370
Um, and, uh, a judge, Trevor Pemberton.
And then there's this principal named, uh,

1807
01:46:56,400 --> 01:47:00,660
it's kinda sound like a joke. Last week
it was a MMA fighter with a politician.

1808
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:04,860
We went to dinner with a
politician, a judge in a high
school principal, you know,

1809
01:47:04,861 --> 01:47:06,870
MMA fighter. What brought us
all together, you know, it was,

1810
01:47:06,871 --> 01:47:11,400
it was bullying prevention.
Um, but, uh, debris on Davis,

1811
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:13,650
she's the high school
principal of Edmond North.

1812
01:47:13,651 --> 01:47:17,490
It's one of the biggest and one of the
best public schools in Oklahoma. Um,

1813
01:47:17,790 --> 01:47:21,840
and in the last nine years of
her working in public schools,

1814
01:47:21,841 --> 01:47:26,250
she's been to nine funerals of kids that
have all committed suicide. And, um,

1815
01:47:26,550 --> 01:47:27,383
it's,
uh,

1816
01:47:27,810 --> 01:47:31,920
it's just on the rise
in such a brutal way.

1817
01:47:32,030 --> 01:47:35,310
And one of the things that really touched
my heart and wanted me to get into to

1818
01:47:35,311 --> 01:47:38,250
this like, Hey, we've
fight for the forgotten.

1819
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:40,080
We're always going to be
focused on the pygmies.

1820
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:43,260
We're working with even
expanding into the, in Uganda,

1821
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:48,190
we're working with the pygmy king of
the Botswana pygmies and Uganda. Um,

1822
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:51,120
we're looking to do land,
water and food initiatives among them,

1823
01:47:51,570 --> 01:47:54,980
but there's kids in our own community
right here that feel forgotten. Um,

1824
01:47:55,110 --> 01:47:57,900
and whenever I was a kid sitting
at the lunch table by myself,

1825
01:47:57,930 --> 01:48:00,510
getting pelted in the back of the
head with chocolate spit wads, uh,

1826
01:48:00,630 --> 01:48:05,430
food fist when kids were pulling up my
shirt and slapping my belly and twist in

1827
01:48:05,431 --> 01:48:09,240
my nipples in front of the girls and
acting like they're hitting me with a

1828
01:48:09,241 --> 01:48:12,960
harpoon, you know, cause I'm the size
of a whale and all this stuff, you know,

1829
01:48:13,010 --> 01:48:15,540
it and telling me,
you should just kill yourself,

1830
01:48:15,850 --> 01:48:18,810
telling me you should just kill yourself.
You're worthless. You're nothing. I mean,

1831
01:48:18,811 --> 01:48:21,870
I, I felt forgotten, um,
and thought, you know,

1832
01:48:21,871 --> 01:48:26,280
I am worthless and I should just kill
myself and dealt with that over and over

1833
01:48:26,281 --> 01:48:27,060
and over.

1834
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:31,710
And now the kids are taking action on
that in such a incredible way that we've

1835
01:48:31,711 --> 01:48:34,500
got to stand up and do something.

1836
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:39,390
And so we're, we're partnering
and, uh, I'm really excited.

1837
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:44,370
Um, we are hopefully getting
into a hundred martial arts
academies this year, um,

1838
01:48:44,371 --> 01:48:46,860
to equip them with bullying
prevention curriculum.

1839
01:48:47,630 --> 01:48:51,390
It's called heroes and waiting and you
know, uh, a real inspiration to me.

1840
01:48:51,391 --> 01:48:53,280
There's two things.
Um,

1841
01:48:53,670 --> 01:48:57,720
there's a ted talk called the psychology
of evil. Oh, I'll text you that link.

1842
01:48:57,780 --> 01:48:58,650
It's incredible.

1843
01:48:59,100 --> 01:49:03,480
But it's the psychology of evil and
it's by getting with Philip Zimbardo or

1844
01:49:03,481 --> 01:49:04,650
something.
Um,

1845
01:49:04,760 --> 01:49:07,860
and in there he kind of coins a term
called heroes and waiting Phillips and

1846
01:49:07,861 --> 01:49:12,360
Barto. Yeah. And, uh, then you, uh,

1847
01:49:12,390 --> 01:49:16,920
you with the audit video that you did
be the hero of your own movie, you know,

1848
01:49:16,921 --> 01:49:21,570
be the hero of your own movie. Um, I
love that. I love that, that, that,

1849
01:49:21,630 --> 01:49:25,750
that you've spoken out and said that
about people you can be the hero of your

1850
01:49:25,780 --> 01:49:27,030
movie.
Well,

1851
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:30,450
he rose in waiting the curriculum that
we developed with century and Maya,

1852
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:35,520
which is the martial arts
industry association. Um,
it's all about teaching kids.

1853
01:49:35,570 --> 01:49:38,220
It's, it's bullying prevention, but
it's also character development.

1854
01:49:39,150 --> 01:49:42,780
So that is what prevents
bullying. Yeah, absolutely.

1855
01:49:42,781 --> 01:49:45,530
The only people that bully or
people with weak characters. Yeah.

1856
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:48,400
And kids that are usually,

1857
01:49:48,610 --> 01:49:50,200
there's something wrong at home,
right?

1858
01:49:50,201 --> 01:49:54,520
You know a lot of these kids that are
bullies usually getting abused at home or

1859
01:49:54,580 --> 01:49:59,410
either by an older brother or by their
dad or cousins or whoever the fuck it is,

1860
01:49:59,411 --> 01:50:02,590
it's and then they're taking it out on
someone who they feel is weaker than them.

1861
01:50:02,890 --> 01:50:03,330
Right.

1862
01:50:03,330 --> 01:50:06,880
This is one of the reasons why I think
martial arts is so important for young

1863
01:50:06,881 --> 01:50:11,881
men because I mean we know
from our experience in gyms
when you're dealing with

1864
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:15,700
like high level martial
artists on a regular basis,

1865
01:50:15,701 --> 01:50:17,200
like there are some of the nicest,

1866
01:50:17,201 --> 01:50:19,870
friendliest fucking people you're ever
going to meet because they don't have any

1867
01:50:19,871 --> 01:50:22,180
insecurities. I mean and
whatever insecurities they have,

1868
01:50:22,181 --> 01:50:24,730
they get out in the gym to
get out through training.

1869
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:26,260
They get all of their frustrations.

1870
01:50:26,530 --> 01:50:30,460
They don't have all this pent up fucked
up energy that a lot of kids have.

1871
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:31,000
Like kids.

1872
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Kids are always dealing with existential
angst and their whole life is just this

1873
01:50:37,330 --> 01:50:42,330
weird ball of confusion and
hormones and you know the,

1874
01:50:42,661 --> 01:50:46,840
the, the whole idea of life
itself is so confusing.

1875
01:50:46,841 --> 01:50:50,650
Then anytime they have any sort of
control of or anything, they exercise it.

1876
01:50:50,651 --> 01:50:53,680
Whether it's control over another
kid or control over, you know,

1877
01:50:53,681 --> 01:50:56,740
throwing a rock through a window or just
they don't know what the fuck they're

1878
01:50:56,741 --> 01:50:57,520
doing.

1879
01:50:57,520 --> 01:51:02,520
You know they have all this pent up
fucked up energy and pain and I think that

1880
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:09,000
so many of them are just severely lacking
in guidance and discipline and just

1881
01:51:10,361 --> 01:51:11,440
those things alone.

1882
01:51:11,650 --> 01:51:15,730
Guidance and discipline and also the
lessons that you learned from martial arts

1883
01:51:15,731 --> 01:51:19,510
that you can overcome things that you can
get better at things and that when you

1884
01:51:19,511 --> 01:51:22,390
feel like quitting and you don't,
you actually grow and learn.

1885
01:51:22,570 --> 01:51:26,700
Like your experience is like training
with Shawn g and Solow. Just like that.

1886
01:51:26,740 --> 01:51:28,750
It's one of the things in
made you said a champion,

1887
01:51:28,990 --> 01:51:31,900
I mean did training with
people that are like,

1888
01:51:32,740 --> 01:51:36,280
it all started with my dad and having
that when I was a kid. Gas, you know,

1889
01:51:36,430 --> 01:51:38,230
you're so fortunate because of that.
I mean,

1890
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:42,400
and those experiences are what shaped
you into the person that you are today.

1891
01:51:42,401 --> 01:51:44,890
And a lot of people don't
get those experiences.

1892
01:51:44,891 --> 01:51:47,020
And unfortunately they
act and disgraceful ways.

1893
01:51:47,021 --> 01:51:49,150
And this is what we're
talking about earlier.

1894
01:51:49,151 --> 01:51:54,151
I mean to bring it all back to what is
martial arts and art is martial arts shit

1895
01:51:54,541 --> 01:51:59,541
talking and throwing dollies or is his
martial arts really competing in one of

1896
01:52:00,701 --> 01:52:05,701
the most difficult endeavors in
all of all of the world of sports?

1897
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:07,271
Well,

1898
01:52:07,271 --> 01:52:10,270
so I came from a wrestling background
and I believe that is without a doubt a

1899
01:52:10,271 --> 01:52:14,470
martial art. Yes, it is for sure.
Side of martial arts. And then, um,

1900
01:52:14,590 --> 01:52:18,040
in my coaches, one of the most important
martial yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.

1901
01:52:18,041 --> 01:52:22,390
In one of the toughest to do. Yeah. One
of the toughest without a doubt. And then,

1902
01:52:22,450 --> 01:52:27,130
um, but then coming into Rafales
Gym, uh, I mean academy in school,

1903
01:52:27,490 --> 01:52:30,130
it started teaching me like
the martial arts principles.

1904
01:52:30,131 --> 01:52:34,090
We didn't really talk about
that so much. Um, in, uh,

1905
01:52:34,180 --> 01:52:37,740
in wrestling it teaches you that,
that naturally the hard work cause it,

1906
01:52:38,650 --> 01:52:41,630
it thins the flock pretty
quick if you can cut it right.

1907
01:52:42,130 --> 01:52:45,980
But then what are the six
blades? So Solow, he, uh,

1908
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:50,630
his logo, uh, it's the star in and
uh, he considers the mineral middle,

1909
01:52:50,660 --> 01:52:55,160
the spirit of the Samurai, and then
there's six blades to the star. Um,

1910
01:52:55,370 --> 01:52:59,930
and they stand for six different
values. Uh, loyalty, respect,

1911
01:53:00,290 --> 01:53:04,280
honor, discipline, attitude and family.

1912
01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:08,720
And those are the core principles in
start inside the Children's program at my

1913
01:53:08,721 --> 01:53:12,870
academy. Uh, and sort of
just the, there, the uh,

1914
01:53:12,910 --> 01:53:16,730
it's a very famous logo. Yes,
it is. And I have right here,

1915
01:53:17,270 --> 01:53:21,860
I carry it with me everywhere I am.
Yeah, that's it. But, um, you know,

1916
01:53:21,861 --> 01:53:25,860
besides for the, you know,
the, those are the, the,

1917
01:53:25,861 --> 01:53:27,860
the core values and then,
you know,

1918
01:53:27,861 --> 01:53:32,450
being a forever student and dedicating
your life to learning and bettering

1919
01:53:32,451 --> 01:53:37,220
yourself. I mean, these
things that martial arts gives
you. I just, I, you know,

1920
01:53:37,460 --> 01:53:41,210
there are certain areas and other sports
that they give you a piece of that,

1921
01:53:41,211 --> 01:53:43,670
but nothing is like martial
arts, you know, for me,

1922
01:53:43,970 --> 01:53:47,390
everything that I've learned
through martial arts, there's, yeah.

1923
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:48,550
I think what you're saying that there's,

1924
01:53:48,551 --> 01:53:52,120
there's other sports that teach
you discipline. Like just me.

1925
01:53:52,130 --> 01:53:53,750
If you become a long distance runner,
there's,

1926
01:53:53,751 --> 01:53:56,360
there's discipline involved in that.
It's going to build up your character,

1927
01:53:56,361 --> 01:53:59,750
but it's not specifically emphasized
the way it is and martial arts.

1928
01:54:00,410 --> 01:54:04,220
And so I've been looking into
and researching and we're
partnering with century.

1929
01:54:04,221 --> 01:54:06,800
We're partnering with Zebra,
we're partnering with Gameness,

1930
01:54:06,801 --> 01:54:08,990
we're partnering with Souplesse.
Uh,

1931
01:54:08,991 --> 01:54:12,830
I don't know if you've seen the Bulgarian
bags and the throwing dummies and the

1932
01:54:12,831 --> 01:54:15,830
gladiator wall. We're partnering
with them because of Gladiator Wall.

1933
01:54:15,890 --> 01:54:18,710
Glad your wall is a,
the wood that is,

1934
01:54:18,711 --> 01:54:21,710
you can hang on it and you can do all
sorts of stretching in different bars.

1935
01:54:21,711 --> 01:54:23,870
The level almost looks like
a ladder. Actually, Jamie,

1936
01:54:23,871 --> 01:54:25,980
if you could pull up fight
for the forgotten.org um,

1937
01:54:26,150 --> 01:54:28,460
I've actually got some show in their soup.
Less on there.

1938
01:54:28,810 --> 01:54:31,400
We should give a shout out to
the cash APP too. Oh my gosh.

1939
01:54:31,430 --> 01:54:34,130
The cash APP is one of
my favorite sponsors,

1940
01:54:34,131 --> 01:54:39,131
has done an incredible thing in
donating $5 to fight for the forgotten.

1941
01:54:39,161 --> 01:54:42,490
And every time someone signs up and
uses the code word Joe Rogan. Yup.

1942
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:46,160
Which is pretty amazing.
Thousands of dollars from
that. They've built two wells,

1943
01:54:46,161 --> 01:54:50,470
more of a more, more coming in January.
We're starting to implement, but, um,

1944
01:54:50,540 --> 01:54:55,280
cash app came to me and we were
trying to do a $50,000 fundraiser,

1945
01:54:55,560 --> 01:55:00,080
um, to drill a deep, deep well, um,
in Tanzania for the Masai Warriors.

1946
01:55:00,340 --> 01:55:03,860
Um, and we're going to do that with water
boys, which is Chris Lungs, a foundation,

1947
01:55:03,861 --> 01:55:05,450
Chris long police for
the Philadelphia Eagles.

1948
01:55:05,451 --> 01:55:08,570
He won the super bowl doing it his
entire salary. Really great guy,

1949
01:55:08,571 --> 01:55:11,690
climbed Mount Kilimanjaro with him and
we were partnering together to help this

1950
01:55:11,691 --> 01:55:15,470
village to get 7,500 people clean water.
So it's about $6 per person.

1951
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:20,030
I started posting about that and Gary
Mcmanus from cash app hit me up and was

1952
01:55:20,031 --> 01:55:23,000
just like, hey, we want to do
something big with you guys. Um,

1953
01:55:23,090 --> 01:55:27,140
and we already had another $50,000 donor
that was being anonymous and cash up

1954
01:55:27,141 --> 01:55:30,230
came in and said, hey, we're going
to match that $50,000 match you have.

1955
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:33,890
So Kashyap gives $50,000
if we could raise 50,000.

1956
01:55:34,220 --> 01:55:39,200
And so we ended up raising
50,000, $52,625, and then,

1957
01:55:39,260 --> 01:55:40,460
uh,
and then it was tripled.

1958
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:45,700
So it came out to being 152,625 and a
cash app gave us $50,000 because they

1959
01:55:48,751 --> 01:55:51,150
believe in the mission and vision
of fight for the forgotten.

1960
01:55:51,420 --> 01:55:55,890
They believe in you and they believe
in this community. Um, and me and I,

1961
01:55:55,891 --> 01:55:57,960
I absolutely love a cash app.
The,

1962
01:55:57,970 --> 01:56:01,030
in fact on this crowdfunding
tournament we're doing, um,

1963
01:56:01,470 --> 01:56:05,970
on the website fight for
the forgotten.org/heroes,

1964
01:56:06,270 --> 01:56:08,820
we're doing a heroes and
waiting crowdfunding tournament.

1965
01:56:09,120 --> 01:56:12,330
And so we're inviting you in a hundred
martial arts academies in a hundred

1966
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:16,610
individuals to help us raise $4,200 there.

1967
01:56:16,730 --> 01:56:17,620
And so,
yeah,

1968
01:56:17,700 --> 01:56:21,480
we're doing it through December 31st
so we're given us quite a bit of time,

1969
01:56:21,810 --> 01:56:25,140
but what we're going to be doing is the
crowdfunding tournament is going to fund

1970
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:26,273
a wells.

1971
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:30,480
So we'll transform a community with the
$4,200 and it will equip their martial

1972
01:56:30,481 --> 01:56:33,000
arts academy with the bullying
prevention curriculum.

1973
01:56:33,210 --> 01:56:35,400
So they don't just amazing
by the way. Yeah. Yeah.

1974
01:56:35,610 --> 01:56:40,610
Everything that you could ever ask for
a to help pass that knowledge along and

1975
01:56:41,821 --> 01:56:46,050
increase your program, you know, help
your school, bring more kids in a,

1976
01:56:46,051 --> 01:56:49,380
make a bigger impact. Um, so not
only are you helping the kids,

1977
01:56:49,381 --> 01:56:54,180
but then you're also raising money, uh,
inside the academy to help towards, um,

1978
01:56:54,210 --> 01:56:56,240
you know, the fight for
the forgotten. Yeah.

1979
01:56:56,240 --> 01:56:59,540
And uh, it's, it's going to
be a thing where, so it's,

1980
01:56:59,570 --> 01:57:03,160
there's 12 weeks of Mat chat topics and
I love it because he rose in waiting,

1981
01:57:03,180 --> 01:57:06,950
talks about, hey, everyone is a
hero in waiting. And what is a hero?

1982
01:57:07,220 --> 01:57:11,390
A hero is someone who sees a need
and takes action immediately.

1983
01:57:11,720 --> 01:57:15,980
And so we're teaching the kids that,
hey, guess what? 87% of the time,

1984
01:57:16,010 --> 01:57:19,310
whenever you see bullying and you say
something, it can be as easy as, hey,

1985
01:57:19,311 --> 01:57:20,620
that's not kind or,

1986
01:57:20,690 --> 01:57:23,270
or you include the person that's
being bullied into your group. Hey,

1987
01:57:23,271 --> 01:57:26,290
come over here. Um,
within five seconds, uh,

1988
01:57:26,360 --> 01:57:29,780
the bullying stops 87% of the time.
All you have to do is say one thing,

1989
01:57:30,290 --> 01:57:32,360
87% of them,
almost nine out of 10 times.

1990
01:57:32,361 --> 01:57:35,000
You can shut down bullying
whenever you see it happening.

1991
01:57:35,030 --> 01:57:37,950
Because here's the problem.
Whenever people think you're,

1992
01:57:38,390 --> 01:57:39,680
when you see bullying happening,

1993
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:42,710
a lot of times you might think
you're innocent bystander, but,

1994
01:57:42,711 --> 01:57:45,620
but your body language and you being
around and involved in the bully,

1995
01:57:45,621 --> 01:57:49,400
seeing that he takes you being
that you're a silent supporter,

1996
01:57:49,790 --> 01:57:52,850
so you're not an innocent bystander,
you're now involved when you see it.

1997
01:57:53,180 --> 01:57:55,910
And so you're being a silent supporter
if you're not standing up and doing

1998
01:57:55,911 --> 01:57:59,360
something about it. And so we're
doing this competition and whoever,

1999
01:57:59,390 --> 01:58:03,140
whoever's the top crowdfunding,
uh, team is going to get there.

2000
01:58:03,141 --> 01:58:07,910
Jim Renovated by Zebra, they're going
to get $10,000 worth a zebra mats. Um,

2001
01:58:07,911 --> 01:58:11,690
century is going to come in
and do $10,000 worth of a gear.

2002
01:58:11,720 --> 01:58:16,520
They're going to do gloves, uh,
headgear, sparring equipment, shields,

2003
01:58:16,590 --> 01:58:21,050
uh, the Bob the dummy. Um, souplesse is
going to do the, the Bulgarian bag, uh,

2004
01:58:21,090 --> 01:58:26,000
throwing dummy and then the top individual
fundraiser is going to get a free

2005
01:58:26,001 --> 01:58:29,680
home gym from Zebra and
century gear. Uh, Bella toward,

2006
01:58:29,681 --> 01:58:33,740
just let me know last night that whoever
is the top fundraising individual is

2007
01:58:33,741 --> 01:58:38,090
going to get flown out
all inclusive, um, to uh,

2008
01:58:38,450 --> 01:58:42,610
to the January 26th, the
heavyweight Prix finale, uh,

2009
01:58:42,611 --> 01:58:46,420
between [inaudible] Ryan Bader Ryan
Bader Forum at the forum in La.

2010
01:58:46,650 --> 01:58:47,380
So you're going to get,

2011
01:58:47,380 --> 01:58:50,320
they're going to get three nights of
hotel rooms are going to get their airfare

2012
01:58:50,321 --> 01:58:51,640
paid for.
And uh,

2013
01:58:51,641 --> 01:58:56,170
so basically what fight for the forgotten
is trying to do is raise $420,000

2014
01:58:56,410 --> 01:58:57,340
throughout the rest of the year.

2015
01:58:57,670 --> 01:59:00,490
And what we'll be able to do with that
is hopefully drill equivalent to 100

2016
01:59:00,491 --> 01:59:03,490
water wells were served
30,000 people minimum.

2017
01:59:03,940 --> 01:59:08,670
Hopefully we'll be around 45,000 people
with clean water. And then, um, it, it's,

2018
01:59:08,700 --> 01:59:11,950
it's pretty easy if people go
and hit sign up. Um, Jamie,

2019
01:59:11,951 --> 01:59:15,520
if you could just hit the
link. It's a, it's sign up. It.

2020
01:59:15,550 --> 01:59:18,250
We're trying to make it really fun and
consider, tell people how to get to it.

2021
01:59:18,251 --> 01:59:22,270
It's fight for the forgotten.org
forward slash. Heroes.

2022
01:59:22,490 --> 01:59:26,150
It's forward slash heroes. And then
here, whenever they go down, um,

2023
01:59:26,350 --> 01:59:30,220
you can hit become a fundraiser and
whenever you become a fundraiser,

2024
01:59:30,221 --> 01:59:34,000
you can either create a team, which we
did with Lovato's a couple of nights ago.

2025
01:59:34,370 --> 01:59:37,180
Um, you can hit join a team.
So if a team's already created,

2026
01:59:37,181 --> 01:59:40,000
you can join that team where if you're
an individual martial artist or just

2027
01:59:40,001 --> 01:59:41,320
someone that's passionate about the cause,

2028
01:59:41,590 --> 01:59:45,160
you can hit start fundraising
as an individual. Awesome. Um,

2029
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:49,210
and then we're going to have a top 10
prizes. Uh, basically like price backs.

2030
01:59:49,390 --> 01:59:52,750
The top crowdfunding team is going to
get a championship belt to fight for the

2031
01:59:52,751 --> 01:59:53,860
forgotten championship belt.

2032
01:59:54,490 --> 01:59:56,680
Two through 10 are going to
get championship trophies.

2033
01:59:56,860 --> 02:00:00,310
And then anyone that hits the goal of
$4,200 is going to get a fight for the

2034
02:00:00,311 --> 02:00:04,390
forgotten gold metal for hitting
the goal. Um, but the, uh, if,

2035
02:00:04,420 --> 02:00:07,090
if you actually click out of
that and then scroll down, Jamie,

2036
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:10,300
you can actually see how it's
kind of started a little bit more,

2037
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:12,490
but there's a already a few teams.

2038
02:00:12,700 --> 02:00:15,370
There's four teams now that have
signed up and some of our res,

2039
02:00:15,400 --> 02:00:19,690
we haven't announced it yet,
so, um, there's team Lovato
down there, there's, and it,

2040
02:00:19,691 --> 02:00:22,960
what it will do is they'll show the top
team so you can track it and make it

2041
02:00:22,961 --> 02:00:26,170
competitive so that you can go on there
and make a comment whenever you donate.

2042
02:00:26,470 --> 02:00:29,110
Um, but basically I guess
martial arts and more, uh,

2043
02:00:29,140 --> 02:00:33,760
I do know them if you click on their page.
Um, it's a guy out of South Carolina,

2044
02:00:33,761 --> 02:00:35,940
sorry, North Carolina, Jacksonville. Um,

2045
02:00:36,040 --> 02:00:38,960
and he just got hit by the
hurricane brutally. Um,

2046
02:00:39,010 --> 02:00:43,210
he can't go back into his home
for another year, a year, a year.

2047
02:00:43,211 --> 02:00:46,300
He can't go back into his home. He's
living in the academy. Why a year?

2048
02:00:46,780 --> 02:00:49,830
His homeowner's association set,
it's going to be like a year of clean up,

2049
02:00:49,831 --> 02:00:53,860
fix everything, fix everything.
That's what it's predicted to be.

2050
02:00:54,190 --> 02:00:59,040
But he said at $4,200, he wants
to teach his community. Um,

2051
02:00:59,140 --> 02:01:04,090
it says James, right. And, uh, he, he's
wanting to, you know, teach the kids that,

2052
02:01:04,091 --> 02:01:05,740
hey,
we're still heroes in waiting.

2053
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:09,370
We can still make a difference in our
community with bullying prevention and

2054
02:01:09,371 --> 02:01:11,650
globally with a community
that needs clean water.

2055
02:01:11,980 --> 02:01:15,070
And so that's what we're trying to do
is make a difference in both places.

2056
02:01:15,110 --> 02:01:17,110
Awesome. Drill the wells and, um,

2057
02:01:17,260 --> 02:01:20,470
equip the martial arts academy with
bullying prevention. Beautiful.

2058
02:01:20,900 --> 02:01:23,850
And let's wrap this up. Um, just
want to say one more thing. Yeah,

2059
02:01:23,860 --> 02:01:26,310
I just wanted to back it up
one more time. You know, uh,

2060
02:01:26,610 --> 02:01:29,540
Justin has inspired me so much to,
you know,

2061
02:01:29,560 --> 02:01:32,830
get involved in these sorts of
things and, and uh, you know,

2062
02:01:32,831 --> 02:01:37,831
I'm happy to have my school involved and
I'm just kind of out there calling out

2063
02:01:38,471 --> 02:01:40,010
for all the other juices,
schools,

2064
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:44,120
um, you know, in the country.
Like, I mean, if we just
get two schools per state,

2065
02:01:44,121 --> 02:01:48,470
that's a hundred. Um, and
if each one, uh, you know,

2066
02:01:48,471 --> 02:01:53,180
reaches the goal of 4,200 than we've
done it. Um, and so, you know, uh,

2067
02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:56,870
it's, it's a great cause it
helps the school, uh, the,

2068
02:01:56,871 --> 02:02:00,970
the material that they get
a is a very, um, helpful to,

2069
02:02:01,030 --> 02:02:03,140
to implement it to their
children's programs,

2070
02:02:03,490 --> 02:02:07,700
even comes with marketing material to
help get those kids in the doors. Um,

2071
02:02:07,820 --> 02:02:11,630
so it's totally worth it. And then,
you know, uh, it's always great, like,

2072
02:02:11,670 --> 02:02:15,860
like he said, you know, when we had the
school Christmas party last year, um,

2073
02:02:15,990 --> 02:02:19,700
and it's always great to get everybody
behind something behind a cause. Um,

2074
02:02:19,790 --> 02:02:23,390
and you know, to get your whole
school to rally together, you know,

2075
02:02:23,391 --> 02:02:26,950
for this cause would be, um, you
know, a great thing for your,

2076
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:31,670
for your teams and your Jujitsu families.
Um, and it's not that hard to do,

2077
02:02:31,730 --> 02:02:35,240
you know, it's not that hard
to, to, to hit 4,200. Um,

2078
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:38,740
and if we get a hundred schools to do
it then, then we've done it. So I'm,

2079
02:02:38,750 --> 02:02:42,080
I'm here, you know, to, to
support Justin in that. Beautiful.

2080
02:02:42,170 --> 02:02:44,040
It's always great to have your
brother and your brother, so,

2081
02:02:45,230 --> 02:02:47,540
so happy for what you've
been able to accomplish.

2082
02:02:47,541 --> 02:02:51,500
So happy to know you and to be a part
of this and just to spread the word.

2083
02:02:51,530 --> 02:02:53,970
That's beautiful. Wow.
Thank you man. This, uh,

2084
02:02:54,010 --> 02:02:56,690
it couldn't be done without you and
your help. I mean, honestly, it's a,

2085
02:02:56,691 --> 02:02:59,330
it's skyrocket at us, um, to
be able to make the difference.

2086
02:02:59,331 --> 02:03:02,900
We want to knock out the water crisis
and to stand up and speak out against

2087
02:03:02,901 --> 02:03:05,780
spooling here and what's my honor,
and thank you for being here,

2088
02:03:05,781 --> 02:03:07,460
Rafael and kilos of luck to you.

2089
02:03:07,461 --> 02:03:10,640
I know you're supposedly next in line
for a shot at the title and Bella Toy

2090
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:14,240
Garden was saucy. Everything looks good.
I can't wait. Thank you. Appreciate it.

2091
02:03:14,310 --> 02:03:17,110
Thanks for being here. It was awesome.
All right, we'll see you later folks.

2092
02:03:22,860 --> 02:03:25,320
