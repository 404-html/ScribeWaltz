1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370
Still sexual because of society,

2
00:00:02,371 --> 00:00:03,060
because of,

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,070
that's why women think
of women as being sexual.

4
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:08,160
It's like women will make out
with women and party with women,

5
00:00:08,161 --> 00:00:09,930
and part of it is because
they think that guys like it.

6
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:14,931
But also part of it is because in our
society that it has been deemed that women

7
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:16,260
are more sexual,

8
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:17,400
they're more sex objects.

9
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:19,980
They use them to sell watches
and cars and shit like that.

10
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:22,260
It's like it's more natural and accepted.

11
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,640
So I think a gay guy would have way less
problems fucking a straight girl than a

12
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:28,470
straight guy would have fucking a gay guy.

13
00:00:28,471 --> 00:00:29,100
You know what I mean?

14
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:29,490
Okay.

15
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,301
So if you said to a guy,

16
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:30,511
guy,

17
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:31,051
fuck a girl,

18
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:34,800
he probably do it quicker than a Hetero
guy would fuck another guy in the ass.

19
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,540
Even though he'd fuck
is going on the last,

20
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:37,740
the Hetero guy was in prison.

21
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,270
Let's then it's alive.

22
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,440
Different Ball because guys,

23
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:40,890
guys are saying,

24
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:41,650
I'm not gay,

25
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,230
but just made it put my cooking something.

26
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,133
Yeah,

27
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,090
that's a strange thing,

28
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:45,391
isn't it?

29
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:46,620
How much humans adapt?

30
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,230
They adapt so much that
straight people become gay.

31
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,510
While they're in jail to jail.

32
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,220
I've become the best master
bedroom on the planet.

33
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,630
I'll fucking get artwork.

34
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,290
I saw a shank that someone
made at a toilet paper.

35
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,080
They don't know exactly
how the dude did this,

36
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,260
but he somehow or another created a shank
and use something to harden to toilet

37
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:07,854
paper,

38
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,910
shank dues.

39
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,620
The weirdest thing ever.

40
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:14,550
I mean just you think about
human ingenuity and one
of the things about prison

41
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:17,760
is that these guys are forced to
adapt and survive and you know,

42
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:19,530
and kind of use their ingenuity.

43
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,060
Here's their creativity and
create things that no one,

44
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,320
that's why they develop
tattoo needles with,

45
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,621
you know,

46
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:28,260
at a take pens and they
get the ink and they,

47
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,430
they'll burn things and use the,

48
00:01:30,431 --> 00:01:30,701
the,

49
00:01:30,701 --> 00:01:30,931
the,

50
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:31,764
the milk.

51
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:33,750
They'll like make ink.

52
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:37,170
They make their own ink out of
burning plastic and burning paper.

53
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,010
And then they figured out how to make
some sort of a machine with a battery.

54
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:44,400
And it's really kind of amazing some of
the things that people had done in jail.

55
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,350
But this was one of the weirdest man.

56
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,060
The guy made a weapon out of toilet paper.

57
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,890
Someone with it or don't they found it?

58
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:50,790
I think they found it,

59
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,510
but they don't.

60
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,780
They don't know what the fuck this
guy did to make the toilet paper hard.

61
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,681
But you know,

62
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:58,140
he had made it to the point
where it was like plaster.

63
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:58,831
Fuck.

64
00:01:58,831 --> 00:01:59,281
It was like,

65
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:02,940
he like he had developed a shank and
actual shank out of toilet paper.

66
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,451
Man,

67
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:04,370
it's one plus on everyone.

68
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:06,030
I end up fucking imprisonment.

69
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,470
I would not survive.

70
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,210
It's a dark fucking world man.

71
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,400
I know a dude who just got
out of this guy warm machine,

72
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:11,641
you know,

73
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:11,881
warming.

74
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,560
So one machine can be nice guy.

75
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,371
Writer's room twitting.

76
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:16,080
You ask him where you were playing.

77
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,381
Yeah,

78
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:17,214
he got a,

79
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,600
he got in some shit on Twitter.

80
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:19,710
It wasn't a pretty experienced.

81
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,650
It's not,

82
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,361
it's horrible.

83
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:22,194
And that's just,

84
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,170
that's just small time shit
that's just doing a year.

85
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:25,890
You know,

86
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,080
you watch those locked down shows,

87
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,600
we'll get to scary man.

88
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,010
There's windows in
Jersey for strike force.

89
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:33,360
I remember driving back to the airport.

90
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,490
I'm not sure what was
Newark or JFK or whatever,

91
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,920
but on the way to the airport
actually we you drove,

92
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,590
you drove past a prison
yard and in Australia,

93
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:42,780
like in Melbourne we have one prison.

94
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,040
We have bough in prison now,

95
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:44,761
which is in the country.

96
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:45,750
It's like out of Melbourne.

97
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,300
We used to have a um,

98
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:47,900
uh,

99
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,010
a one right in the heart of
the city but now it's out.

100
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,820
So I'm not used to saint prisoners and
like we drove past a prison yard and like

101
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:57,300
as you driving past the fucking fence
to the prisoners right there with

102
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:59,190
prisoners walking around
in fucking orange.

103
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,050
And even though I was in a
cab or sort of shit myself,

104
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:04,330
just not used to sing
that being from Australia,

105
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:06,700
I'm like prisoners right there,

106
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,680
right near the road.

107
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,130
I can see them walking around.

108
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:10,200
The president is very kick,

109
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:10,631
big,

110
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:11,171
big sign.

111
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:12,640
The numbers of people in prisons,

112
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:14,830
a big sign that this society is a mess.

113
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,090
That's if you ever wanted like some real
hardcore evidence as to how much of a

114
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:20,110
mess I society is.

115
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,670
Our prison numbers are huge.

116
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,930
More people are in prep,

117
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:24,960
more black banner in prison
right now then wherever.

118
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:25,800
Slaves.

119
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,370
Really?

120
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:26,620
Yeah,

121
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,453
I believe so.

122
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,023
I think that's true though.

123
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:29,860
Um,

124
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,641
and you know,

125
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:30,881
the,

126
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:31,990
just the sheer numbers,

127
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:32,920
there's millions of people.

128
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,840
There's more people in jail in America,

129
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,220
then all of China.

130
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,211
And that's incredible.

131
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:39,160
When you consider China
has over a billion people,

132
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:40,660
there's way more people in jail here.

133
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,140
Fuck.

134
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,300
We have more people in jail
than several countries.

135
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:45,880
Like if you add up a bunch of
different countries in a row,

136
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,830
we have more putting more
people in jail than them.

137
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,401
Fuck,

138
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:49,031
that is amazing.

139
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:49,181
Well,

140
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:50,110
they make money off of it.

141
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:53,400
That's the sickest part about our jail
system is that we have private business,

142
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,280
the Giles Beta,

143
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,250
very crammed and they're building
more of them all the time and they're

144
00:03:57,251 --> 00:03:59,860
arresting people and more and
more silly shit all the time.

145
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,021
Well,

146
00:04:00,021 --> 00:04:00,401
what's the,

147
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:01,030
um,

148
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,840
the one in San Fran.

149
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,640
San Quintin.

150
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:02,931
Yeah.

151
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:06,580
So we did a tour in San Francisco a few
days ago and that the two of God pointy

152
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,110
at San Quintin and he said,

153
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:09,520
it looks like there
might be a possibility.

154
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,020
It's going to be sold soon.

155
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,650
Prison's going to be sold.

156
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,493
San Quentin prison,

157
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,620
the the land is going to,

158
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:15,850
the prison is going to close down.

159
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:19,960
They'll like had to prison somewhere
else and terrible down and build luck.

160
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:21,250
San Quintin estate,

161
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,240
putting houses on it.

162
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,680
I San Quintin is at the moment.

163
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,300
He said it's a really good
chance of that happening.

164
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:28,630
Who the fuck would want to live
over all that gay rape dude,

165
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,820
it is in Melbourne and
same Pinch Ridge Child.

166
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:32,640
So I was trying to think
of before was in Coburg,

167
00:04:32,641 --> 00:04:35,290
which is in Melbourne's
inner northern suburbs,

168
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,230
which has become quite a
trendy spot at that moment.

169
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,860
Used to be just the big
ethnic spot still is,

170
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:43,390
but now a trendy spot and that's where
Pinterest prison was located and years

171
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,320
ago they tore down pantry.

172
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:44,471
Jen,

173
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:45,430
now it's apartments.

174
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,270
Don't they remember if Poulter guys,

175
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,760
they build those houses over the Indian
burial grounds and then the ghost to the

176
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:53,510
Indians came and fucked everybody up.

177
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,761
You know,

178
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:57,610
I'd buy an apartment of goals of
all the shakings and all that.

179
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:59,800
Just all of them at the
four biggest ones on men.

180
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,730
If you ever get to Melbourne,

181
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:02,380
I'll take you to the old Melbourne jail,

182
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:04,240
which is still spelt J I o.

183
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:07,460
L the old way when Ned Kelly
and most famous my skull.

184
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,041
Yeah,

185
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:09,461
Gil.

186
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:12,750
The old English spelling is G.

187
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:12,750
I.

188
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:12,750
O.

189
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:12,750
L.

190
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:12,750
G.

191
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:12,750
A.

192
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,240
L.

193
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,850
So old Melbourne jail.

194
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,000
Pronounced pronounced Gerald though.

195
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,400
Might just spelling goal though.

196
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,050
No,

197
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,310
Miss Aol and C o.

198
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,740
L.

199
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:21,770
E.

200
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,720
So gale,

201
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,860
but pronounced Jr,

202
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:24,880
but it's the old spelling,

203
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:27,990
the old English style for jail
and old Melbourne Giles way.

204
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,870
Ned Kelly,

205
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,550
who's the most famous
criminal of all time.

206
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:30,971
You know what I'm saying?

207
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:31,750
Movies on him.

208
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,580
He was the dude that wore
like a fucking nightmare.

209
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,270
I thought chopper was
the most short reads,

210
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,450
the most popular at the moment.

211
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,081
He's off the,

212
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:38,620
you know,

213
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,300
he's away.

214
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,500
The last 10 years or so since
Eric Bana did the movie.

215
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,320
That was a great movie.

216
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,990
A fantastic fucking Eric Bender rocks,

217
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:44,290
man.

218
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,123
He's a bad motherfucker.

219
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,430
A bonafide celebrity now in Australia.

220
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:48,910
He's good.

221
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,730
I liked that a comedian who does
the impressions of him hard enough.

222
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:52,250
Fuck out.

223
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:52,540
Yeah,

224
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:52,760
yeah,

225
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,170
yeah,

226
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:53,360
yeah.

227
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,980
Doing the weather and that talking a
little about these hot enough fuck out.

228
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,260
You know,

229
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,940
the whole criminal thing in,

230
00:05:58,941 --> 00:05:59,180
uh,

231
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,850
in Melbourne at the moment
is really being glorified,

232
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:05,360
especially at our mobsters because
there's this underbelly TV series,

233
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,430
which I think is hit America
on one of the networks,

234
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:08,870
but underbelly is intellect.

235
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:09,704
It's fourth season.

236
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,131
So now,

237
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:10,391
and it's a,

238
00:06:10,391 --> 00:06:11,750
it started off being about the,

239
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:12,110
uh,

240
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,280
the Melbourne underworld,

241
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:15,140
the Italian mobs and the,

242
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,711
you know,

243
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:19,400
the Aussie sort of mobs that were
warring with each other over the last 15

244
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:19,650
years.

245
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,780
And there's only a few of them left now.

246
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,820
They ended up mostly
killing each other off,

247
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,040
but I'm just a news Piper's a full of it.

248
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,320
An underbelly series is right.

249
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,340
It's so high in Australia.

250
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:28,641
There's that.

251
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:29,090
So it,

252
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,010
it's a nation we've with,

253
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,040
with mobsters,

254
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,350
they become like celebrities.

255
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:33,891
Exactly.

256
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:35,150
Then it becomes more popular.

257
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:35,990
Yup.

258
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,290
Yeah.

259
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,700
They have mob wives here.

260
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:38,600
Have you ever seen this mob?

261
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,950
I'll sort of have to set a mob wives.

262
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:41,540
So it was fucking monsters.

263
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,823
Yeah.

264
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:44,751
Yeah.

265
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:45,680
It's just so crazy.

266
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:46,161
There's one,

267
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:48,830
the fat one who's by herself
and her husband left her,

268
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,641
you know the divorce,

269
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:53,480
but she's like a big star of it and she's
always screaming and when there's less

270
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:53,991
on TV,

271
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:56,510
she's smoking cigarettes and crying
and screaming and you're like,

272
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,380
oh,

273
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,430
this monster.

274
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,840
If these women end up with these guys,

275
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:00,130
you know,

276
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:00,350
guys,

277
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,460
chicks that go to prison,

278
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:04,850
they flipped the fuck guys in prison and
like have relationships with dude's in

279
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:05,240
prison.

280
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,040
Like has a woman get to that point?

281
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,600
They love the strong,

282
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,930
like the the s w what would it represents?

283
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:12,081
You know,

284
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:13,300
they like going into a restaurant.

285
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,330
Everybody respects them.

286
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,990
They like the fact that people pick up
the tab because they're afraid of these

287
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:18,700
people.

288
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,720
The two fucking fucking,

289
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,040
yeah,

290
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:23,420
yeah.

291
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:23,661
There's,

292
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:24,740
there's something about it.

293
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:25,130
It's like,

294
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:25,761
you know what I mean?

295
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:27,470
It goes back to the godfather movies.

296
00:07:27,471 --> 00:07:29,810
It goes back to the John
Gadi thing in New York.

297
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:33,710
It's like there's this weird sort of a
romantic thing of knowing someone that's

298
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:34,544
in the Mafia.

299
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,661
People of,

300
00:07:35,661 --> 00:07:36,560
we had finished his man.

301
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,920
I'm watching this organized
crime thing is a deep thing.

302
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,370
I grew up in Boston and
it was Whitey Bulger.

303
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:44,600
That guy who just got busted.

304
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,580
He was on the run for like 16 years,

305
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,910
but he ran the Irish mob and
you know there was a lot of,

306
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:52,190
I were trained with a lot
of Whitey Bulger's hit men.

307
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,630
Did you ever use to
have that Boston accent?

308
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,051
Yeah,

309
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:54,884
I had that for awhile.

310
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,400
Yeah,

311
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:55,851
that's cool.

312
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:56,480
Exit Man.

313
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,110
That was pretty decent.

314
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,500
I love it.

315
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:57,861
It's cool.

316
00:07:57,861 --> 00:07:58,551
Whenever I see a movie,

317
00:07:58,551 --> 00:08:01,640
so your boss Doug Guy and you
want to be look like a Douche bag.

318
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:02,474
It's a great accent.

319
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,070
I love,

320
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,010
I love the sound of the pack.

321
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:07,310
Your fucking car had the
fuck out myself on TV.

322
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:10,660
When I was 19 I was in the bay state
games and taekwondo tournament in there.

323
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,580
I heard myself on TV and it was so bad.

324
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,160
I,

325
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,660
I immediately got rid of the accent
and figured out how to get it out.

326
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:18,081
Yeah,

327
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:18,750
I had had it.

328
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,200
I had it.

329
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,033
It was pretty deep.

330
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,190
We've been working really
hard and I was like,

331
00:08:22,191 --> 00:08:22,911
oh my God.

332
00:08:22,911 --> 00:08:23,661
I listen to myself.

333
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:23,901
I was like,

334
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:27,530
what the fuck is sort of like a mix
between an American and British and

335
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:28,160
something else?

336
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,450
It's really strange,

337
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,211
but I'm,

338
00:08:30,211 --> 00:08:30,420
I'm,

339
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:30,551
I,

340
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:30,960
I love,

341
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,780
I like movies where they
have the Boston accent,

342
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:34,760
but it's fucking hot
accent to try to replicate.

343
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,361
Yeah.

344
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:37,070
It's people fuck it up all the time.

345
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:37,821
Yeah,

346
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:38,091
it's a,

347
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:38,870
it's a tricky one.

348
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,421
It's an interesting,

349
00:08:39,421 --> 00:08:40,280
it's a fun accent.

350
00:08:40,281 --> 00:08:42,350
It's like it's a good accent to have.

351
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,011
If you here,

352
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:43,551
if you're out,

353
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:46,280
if you're drinking and you're around
a bunch of guys at Boston accents,

354
00:08:46,281 --> 00:08:47,720
I guarantee you they're
going to be funnier.

355
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,580
That that's probably the funniest group
of humans per capita is Boston men.

356
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:53,300
You know,

357
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,710
it's hard life up there,

358
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:55,200
man.

359
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,831
Women are ugly.

360
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:56,730
It's cold as fuck.

361
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,490
Women are ugly and Boston
monsters really monsters.

362
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,591
Women in Texas,

363
00:09:00,591 --> 00:09:01,424
it's like I said,

364
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,880
it's not their fault.

365
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,350
It's six.

366
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,080
This is hot women.

367
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,230
It wasn't dealt with the hottest.

368
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,590
Texans have the nicest Americans too.

369
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,020
I think it takes us to just
really polite and you got it.

370
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,251
You're,

371
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:11,551
you're,

372
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,780
you're only dealing with city,

373
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:13,321
Texas.

374
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:14,100
There's a different,

375
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,680
there's a different
Texas chainsaw massacre,

376
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,514
Texas,

377
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,280
and you've got to go out into the way
you got to go to Jasper where they drag

378
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:23,190
black people behind trucks
showing it that there's a,

379
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:23,431
yeah,

380
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:23,911
there's Meth,

381
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:24,390
Texas.

382
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:24,601
Okay,

383
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:25,800
I'll rephrase it to Dallas,

384
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:26,634
Texas.

385
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,650
I love like,

386
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:27,800
Oh,

387
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,561
Rephrase Dallas.

388
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:29,640
Texas is the shit.

389
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,803
This skill,

390
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,500
when I say y'all to like
San Antonio and Houston,

391
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:35,370
Houston is amazing.

392
00:09:35,371 --> 00:09:38,280
Austin is one of my favorite cities
of all tossed and apparently everyone

393
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:38,850
autotune.

394
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,590
It's like one of the most
best cities in America.

395
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:40,861
Yeah.

396
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:41,370
It's incredible.

397
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:41,910
The guy there,

398
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,870
but there's,

399
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:43,380
you know,

400
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,430
there's outside of that,

401
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,460
the problem as you drive outside
of that a half an hour and you're,

402
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,650
you're in fucking Roscoe p Coltrane.

403
00:09:49,651 --> 00:09:50,340
Coltrane,

404
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:50,660
yeah,

405
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:50,881
yeah,

406
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:51,150
yeah.

407
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:51,740
It gets,

408
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,573
it's squirrely.

409
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,840
Texas is real squirrely and they got it.

410
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:56,850
The real conservative laws and they,

411
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,330
you know,

412
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,120
they can fuck you up over reefer.

413
00:09:59,130 --> 00:09:59,963
Anything.

414
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,410
Traps everywhere.

415
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,360
Guy was telling me that make my day law,

416
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:04,280
we can shoot fucked.

417
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,400
Someone that comes into your house,

418
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:07,110
you not only can shoot
somebody comes in your house,

419
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:09,270
you could shoot someone who's
trying to repossess your car.

420
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,020
Yup.

421
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,710
They've had people who shot people who
they thought were trying to steal their

422
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:13,981
car,

423
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:14,791
shot him with a rifle.

424
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:15,900
It turns out was a repo guy.

425
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,360
It turned out that he
was vindicated and guide.

426
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:19,500
Never did any time at all.

427
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,100
Really?

428
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,130
I shot a guy with a fucking deer hunting
rifle that was just trying to do his

429
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:24,330
job and repossess the car.

430
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,370
Yeah.

431
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,010
That's amazing.

432
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:26,400
Yeah.

433
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:26,641
Yeah.

434
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:27,930
You're a car thief.

435
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:28,411
You know?

436
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:29,250
That's how they look at it.

437
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,083
It's like some true,

438
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,920
even though the repo guy is doing,

439
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:32,700
is legal,

440
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:32,941
you know,

441
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:35,250
the bank is repossessing its property
and the hardest guy to do it.

442
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,050
What the shooter is doing is legal too,

443
00:10:37,051 --> 00:10:39,570
because you didn't represent
yourself as a repo man.

444
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:40,590
And even if you did,

445
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,491
even if he did,

446
00:10:41,491 --> 00:10:42,324
he might be able to shoot you.

447
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,260
So it's not true though,

448
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,490
that if you shoot any true to it,

449
00:10:44,491 --> 00:10:45,360
you have to kill them.

450
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,020
No,

451
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,560
it's not true.

452
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:46,861
No,

453
00:10:46,861 --> 00:10:47,700
I'm just going to shoot him.

454
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,061
I mean,

455
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:48,871
you don't have to even shoot.

456
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:49,380
I mean,

457
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,240
there's no law like it's like a deer.

458
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:51,510
You know?

459
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,140
Someone told me,

460
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,640
I just got you shoot them.

461
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:54,630
You get to Mike show you killed him.

462
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:56,190
Otherwise I can see you for shooting them.

463
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:56,371
Well,

464
00:10:56,371 --> 00:10:57,150
I bet they could.

465
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:57,490
Yeah,

466
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,051
I bet they could.

467
00:10:58,051 --> 00:11:01,260
So not necessarily whether they would
win would they could probably take you

468
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:02,094
through the system.

469
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:02,431
Yeah,

470
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:03,000
you,

471
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,260
but if you did shoot them and kill them,

472
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:05,320
it wouldn't know.

473
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:05,971
Then they can't see.

474
00:11:05,971 --> 00:11:06,781
You obviously know that,

475
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:07,350
but it wouldn't be,

476
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,600
you wouldn't be charged for manslaughter.

477
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,120
You know,

478
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,110
people who've gotten in trouble in Texas
for shooting their wife and boyfriend

479
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:13,950
and gotten away with it.

480
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,371
Really?

481
00:11:14,371 --> 00:11:14,680
Yeah.

482
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,370
It's like this is a crime of passion.

483
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:16,861
You come home,

484
00:11:16,861 --> 00:11:18,900
some guys banging your wife
and you fucking shoot him.

485
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:19,561
You know,

486
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:20,490
you can get away with that.

487
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:20,980
There's,

488
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,360
there's some tricky shit that
you can get away with Texas.

489
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:24,841
You know?

490
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:26,730
I don't know if it's a
concealed carry state.

491
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,691
I don't know if it is.

492
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:30,360
I don't know if you're allowed to like
go wild west style and have had all

493
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:34,290
fucking Holston lister is in some
places you're not allowed to do that,

494
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,210
but you are allowed to
carry it out in the open.

495
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,580
So if you have like a handgun,

496
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,520
you just allowed to hold it out in the
open as you walk towards the supermarket.

497
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:42,960
Like what the fuck man,

498
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:43,471
you know,

499
00:11:43,471 --> 00:11:45,840
imagine you know you're going to
the supermarket and some dude,

500
00:11:45,841 --> 00:11:48,810
it's just walking with his gun out in
the open because that's how the law is.

501
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,810
The law states that at the
sand coming to America,

502
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,070
I admit a care is indeed.

503
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,130
What did you think about this whole a
Norway thing that just went down with this

504
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:57,791
one guy?

505
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,730
I'm just getting all the
information yet opened up at a camp,

506
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:01,770
a children's cancer,

507
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,940
a huge amount of children.

508
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,030
I mean I don't know how many it's going
to be all told cause there's a lot of

509
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:08,500
injuries and some of these
kids are going to die,

510
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:11,560
but it's over 80 kids I believe and know
is one of those countries that flies

511
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:12,250
under the radar.

512
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,960
And you'd never hear shit from Norway.

513
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:17,050
Nothing bad ever comes out
of nowhere on my buddy Doug.

514
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:19,510
Stan hope just filmed his last DVD there.

515
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,160
Oslo where this,

516
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:23,530
all this happened now and there's one guy,

517
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:24,430
some crazy.

518
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,920
All they're saying is he's
very religious and you know,

519
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:27,120
and,

520
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,491
and,

521
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:29,140
and anti Muslim I believe,

522
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:30,160
but that's who knows,

523
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,940
who knows how much they even know about
what the fuck the real situation is.

524
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,391
It's,

525
00:12:34,391 --> 00:12:34,661
you know,

526
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:34,900
it's,

527
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,220
the dust is still settling.

528
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,180
What a horrible,

529
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:38,950
horrible fire hoses this paper to do.

530
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:39,311
This is,

531
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:39,581
it just,

532
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:42,010
the thing is just being fucking pure evil.

533
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,360
Just you're fucking evil.

534
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:43,871
You know,

535
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:44,591
who knows man,

536
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:44,801
you know?

537
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:45,980
Did you ever see the,

538
00:12:45,981 --> 00:12:47,680
the man who a shot,

539
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,190
there was a woman who was a congressman
shutting the place where the head or

540
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:51,461
whatever?

541
00:12:51,461 --> 00:12:51,710
Yes.

542
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,500
She lived deferred and then,

543
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:53,741
you know,

544
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:55,510
he killed a bunch of
people also on the scene.

545
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,800
That guy had a bunch of videos that
he had put on Youtube and written some

546
00:12:59,801 --> 00:13:00,760
things and it was just,

547
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,500
he was obviously,

548
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,130
his brain wasn't working right.

549
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,320
He had like his,

550
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:08,470
like he would make these who say these
things are just like would they would

551
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:09,550
call word salad?

552
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,050
Just throw a bunch of words together.

553
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:11,920
It didn't make any sense.

554
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:13,630
Like there was obviously
a disconnect if he was,

555
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,130
it was functioning incorrectly.

556
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,630
And look,

557
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:16,791
the,

558
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:21,310
the human mind is a very complicated
instrument and sometimes it's,

559
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:21,730
it,

560
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,560
it's fucked up and sometimes it's,

561
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,101
it's off.

562
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:26,950
Just like some people get cancer
and some people get diseases,

563
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,990
some people's brains don't.

564
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,810
Some people have some fucking balls
watching his TV show with this guy had a

565
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:35,510
fetish for vomit hills quarter.

566
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,300
Uh,

567
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,133
uh,

568
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,930
it's off the Greek word for vomit.

569
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:39,920
I should have asked Irene,

570
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,210
but as a finish of his,

571
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:45,500
and the only way he could get
hard was when chicks vomited.

572
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,860
So he wouldn't pay prostitutes
to spew on him and vomit.

573
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,650
And if you went to a restaurant
and he saw someone chuck,

574
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,290
he would go and scoop the chuck
up and put her in a plastic bag.

575
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,510
And I took the camera inside this giant
freezer that he'd stored all these bags

576
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:01,610
of vomit from over the years.

577
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,550
And he had each one of
the bags like documented,

578
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,450
so he was grabbing a bag off the off.

579
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,340
They were frozen,

580
00:14:07,341 --> 00:14:07,741
frozen.

581
00:14:07,741 --> 00:14:08,421
He'd grab it,

582
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:09,000
right?

583
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,590
He's like,

584
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,400
oh yeah,

585
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,330
Taco Bell,

586
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:15,920
1992 she fucking blew chunks in the
floor like a fucking get turned on.

587
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,660
Just thinking about it a minute,

588
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,730
a midnight and midnight,

589
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:19,920
midnight.

590
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,440
So fucking finish for people fucking
chucking up and Gil spewing on it.

591
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,070
The only way he could get an erection
if a hooker or a friend of his,

592
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,970
would you pay them to stick their fingers
down their throat and check up on him?

593
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,750
Why don't,

594
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,520
yeah,

595
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,120
like how the fuck do you explain that?

596
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,560
Like also these dudes,

597
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:37,890
dudes,

598
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,520
they called feeders and
they feed those fat chicks.

599
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,591
The little skinny.

600
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:43,760
Have you seen that feeders?

601
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,170
There's something on a TV show.

602
00:14:45,171 --> 00:14:46,030
I saw a show again,

603
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,601
we've got this,

604
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:48,230
he has some crazy shit on TV here.

605
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,300
These little skinny fucking dude's.

606
00:14:50,301 --> 00:14:54,110
It looked like the 45 to 50
kilos in weight and has the,

607
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,170
what is that in pounds?

608
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,450
Pounds higher.

609
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,130
10 pounds.

610
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,520
110 hundred and 20 pounds,

611
00:14:58,521 --> 00:14:59,270
right?

612
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,300
They have these wives or girlfriends
who are fucking behemoths,

613
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,210
like 300 pound Emanuel,

614
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,300
Yarbrough looking fucking women who lie
in bed all day and immobilized because

615
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:08,931
they're so huge.

616
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:11,900
The cat really fucking move and then
little men feed and the little men feed

617
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:12,021
them.

618
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:16,160
They're called feeders and they get off
sexually on feeding these women and just

619
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:19,310
constantly fucking feeding them and
give them these women fucking fat.

620
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,840
I can't say I'm surprised.

621
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,513
I'm surprised.

622
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,850
I would have been surprised if you told
me that 20 years ago if you told me that

623
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:27,020
before I knew about the Internet,

624
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:27,960
I'd be like flat.

625
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:28,863
They can really,

626
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,230
I would say that doesn't
even make any sense.

627
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:30,771
Why would somebody,

628
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:32,270
and maybe one person's into that,

629
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,680
this other dude on the show,

630
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:34,730
online community on this.

631
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,510
I,

632
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:35,721
no,

633
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:36,560
apparently it's like the,

634
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,580
I won't say a popular thing,

635
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:38,450
but it's like a thing.

636
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,420
There's like a feeder community and
fucking skinny dudes are feeding these

637
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:41,960
chicks.

638
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,180
Just feeding them constantly
sitting by the bedside.

639
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,350
Fucking someone needs.

640
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,380
When those people become immobile
and they can't even leave the house,

641
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:48,740
who think,

642
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:48,861
well,

643
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:50,330
that's the perfect time to go on a diet.

644
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,530
You can't even move.

645
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,170
How long would it take to starve
someone like that to death?

646
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,490
If you just gave him water,

647
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,630
they have so much fat.

648
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,310
Precious.

649
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,920
The fact wouldn't pay for a
wall more than a normal person.

650
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,570
You would die of starvation still.

651
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:03,160
Even if you were there,

652
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,540
that would cause your stomach
would start shrinking.

653
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,440
There's extra to happen.

654
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,210
You give them water rights.

655
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,170
They're staying hydrated.

656
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,441
Yeah.

657
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:11,740
If you just gave him water and
how nobody started building,

658
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,010
I don't know.

659
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:13,843
That's what I'm saying.

660
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,170
Don't try to efficient.

661
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,260
I don't think it can just like use
it as an alternative fuel supply,

662
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,221
but then again,

663
00:16:19,221 --> 00:16:21,770
they're not using up any food for energy
because they're just fucking lying

664
00:16:21,771 --> 00:16:22,604
there.

665
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,490
They need some just to
pump blood and breathe air.

666
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:25,910
They need,

667
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:26,900
they need some energy.

668
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,460
I don't think it's possible.

669
00:16:28,461 --> 00:16:28,671
I mean,

670
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,090
I think,

671
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:29,481
I mean I'm,

672
00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:29,661
no,

673
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:30,261
it's not possible.

674
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:32,240
I know you would starve to death
even if you're a big fat fuck,

675
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,490
but I wonder how many days it would last.

676
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,490
I wonder if you would last like
if you had like a lean guy,

677
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,620
you know like you get like a fucking cow,

678
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,030
King's super athlete,

679
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:44,570
lean guy and you put them in a room with
some job of the Hautelook and stop them

680
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:44,841
both.

681
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:45,621
Who would die first?

682
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:46,250
Who would die from?

683
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,083
It's interesting.

684
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:50,060
You would think the fat guy would have
at least a little bit more energy.

685
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,830
How's the little guy fuck the fat chick?

686
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,520
How does everyone find the
pussy to probably does?

687
00:16:53,521 --> 00:16:54,560
It probably does.

688
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:56,330
It probably just fucking tosses off beat.

689
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:57,200
It's somebody who likes him,

690
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,320
you know there's some people out there
that are just happy than anybody likes

691
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:00,411
them.

692
00:17:00,411 --> 00:17:02,420
They'll take anybody broken.

693
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,523
It's probably doesn't.

694
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,770
There was a woman who died who
was like grafted into a couch.

695
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,030
She was slowly,

696
00:17:08,031 --> 00:17:13,031
her skin was starting to graft itself to
the couch and when they cut her out of

697
00:17:13,311 --> 00:17:13,671
the house,

698
00:17:13,671 --> 00:17:16,190
they had cut a hole in the wall
to pull her out of the house.

699
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,091
And when they cut her out,

700
00:17:17,091 --> 00:17:18,710
they had to cut her out with the couch.

701
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:19,880
Fuck yeah.

702
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:21,410
And then she died of complications.

703
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:22,671
Fuck,

704
00:17:22,671 --> 00:17:23,301
that's crazy,

705
00:17:23,301 --> 00:17:23,600
man.

706
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:23,930
Yeah.

707
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:24,231
Well,

708
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:24,801
you know what,

709
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:25,011
there's,

710
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:25,491
like I said,

711
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:26,940
there's a broad spectrum.

712
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,090
People can go off the fucking dignity,

713
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:29,421
dignity,

714
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:31,700
deep end in many different ways.

715
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,990
This other dude on the show had an
obsession that he wanted to return to the

716
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:36,710
womb.

717
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,340
Oh whoa.

718
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:41,000
And he's wife was pregnant and he was
jealous of his unborn child for being in

719
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:41,990
his wife's womb.

720
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:42,981
And he said,

721
00:17:42,981 --> 00:17:43,351
did his thing,

722
00:17:43,351 --> 00:17:44,180
was he,

723
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,970
he had an obsession with
needing to return to the womb.

724
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,280
Can imagine that poor woman have to
deal with that bitch bitch of a man.

725
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:52,350
And that's the one who's
fathering your children.

726
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,060
Some fucking freak,

727
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:59,061
Weirdo fetishes climb back inside fucking
uterus so he doesn't have to deal with

728
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:00,270
it anymore.

729
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:03,320
Cause he's life is all learn.

730
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:08,160
And would it be a BB Gabey Limo me
through me and be saved back in the little

731
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:08,890
house in the prayer.

732
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:09,723
He didn't believe it.

733
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,190
Crazy assholes.

734
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:12,900
Fucking ridiculous.

735
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,740
While we live in extreme times and
you and I traveled in the most extreme

736
00:18:16,741 --> 00:18:17,191
circles,

737
00:18:17,191 --> 00:18:17,401
you know,

738
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:18,300
if you really think about it,

739
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:22,860
the cage fighting commentary
and kickboxing commentary
flying all over the world

740
00:18:22,861 --> 00:18:24,250
and being around all these savages and,

741
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:28,080
and yet we're still shocked by the
level of human behavior out there in the

742
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:28,331
world.

743
00:18:28,331 --> 00:18:33,000
Let's try and use that like I don't
get shocked by the volunt knockouts.

744
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,340
I seen the crazy cuts and
the blood and the sea,

745
00:18:35,341 --> 00:18:38,010
but did you think that when you
were in that fight with that dude,

746
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:38,761
that dude was coming out?

747
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:39,421
You just think like,

748
00:18:39,421 --> 00:18:39,661
wow,

749
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:43,290
I'm just so used to conflict and so
used to fight that it's like it's even

750
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,460
though you're not getting in them,

751
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:49,500
you probably were way more calm than an
average dude because you're so used to

752
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:50,680
being around fun just seed.

753
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:51,690
Mine is just,

754
00:18:51,691 --> 00:18:52,050
it's there.

755
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:52,883
It's always in your face.

756
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,330
Okay,

757
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:53,581
Betty,

758
00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:54,860
you sing it at the highest level,

759
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,561
the lowest level.

760
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:56,640
You just sing it such just,

761
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,380
it's almost programmed into you HC nuts.

762
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,270
Got To step it up,

763
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:00,720
dude.

764
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,410
[inaudible] got to figure out some way
to get on more TVs because they fucking,

765
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,180
the programming is awesome.

766
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:06,871
You know the,

767
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:09,810
the shells that they have as awesome
as the only place to get high level

768
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:11,100
kickboxing in America.

769
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:11,470
It is.

770
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,990
You never see it and we're doing it.

771
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:15,030
Showtime down there shows a fantastic man,

772
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,710
showtime or this one coming up in May.

773
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,230
You?

774
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:17,850
Yeah,

775
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,580
they actually pay you that pie.

776
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,820
One man.

777
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,880
Is Caitlin going to fold and it's
showtime got to take over cause I've heard

778
00:19:23,881 --> 00:19:24,714
that.

779
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,100
I don't think so.

780
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:27,720
I'm told the k one will survive,

781
00:19:27,721 --> 00:19:28,471
but in what capacity?

782
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:29,230
I'm not sure.

783
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,990
Not that it showed Tom will take over,

784
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,620
but it showed time's going to be the
one to watch this and Mark Cuban's a bad

785
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:35,454
motherfucker.

786
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:35,911
Okay.

787
00:19:35,911 --> 00:19:37,950
He owns the God damn world champion.

788
00:19:37,951 --> 00:19:40,980
Dallas Mavericks brought
them along to that title,

789
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,080
owns Hca.

790
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,470
Tell him to step the fuck up.

791
00:19:43,471 --> 00:19:46,170
And by k one it's
probably like 1000 bucks.

792
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,180
You could break by k one for their debt.

793
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,210
I actually heard about
a year and a half ago,

794
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,060
but the price tag for
k one was $30 million.

795
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,860
It's gotta be less than that now,

796
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:56,491
I believe.

797
00:19:56,491 --> 00:19:57,150
Say Yeah.

798
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,640
Well you know that they bought
the UFC for like 2 million,

799
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,420
but if you bought k one
for even 10 million bucks,

800
00:20:03,421 --> 00:20:04,080
man,

801
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,590
dude,

802
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,980
Mark Cuban could turn k
one and two a Munster.

803
00:20:07,981 --> 00:20:08,281
Fuck.

804
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:10,200
You take the same level of talent,

805
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,700
the real high end guys,

806
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:13,590
they have now at k one Max and,

807
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,660
and the the the k one Grand Prix,

808
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:19,380
the heavyweight Grand Prix and put those
on in Vegas and make a big fucking deal

809
00:20:19,381 --> 00:20:19,830
out of it.

810
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,840
Maybe the prison or never at all.

811
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,120
Dana,

812
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,770
what the fuck out Mark Cuban please?

813
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:26,890
We're begging you.

814
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,590
Step the fuck up.

815
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:30,150
There's an opening to be had here.

816
00:20:30,151 --> 00:20:31,920
There's some product to be sold.

817
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,380
This is a fucking strong possibility.

818
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,341
You can make it happen.

819
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:36,174
Mark Cuban.

820
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,893
Um,

821
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:38,580
all right,

822
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,910
this is a long fucking podcast.

823
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,000
It's hours,

824
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,001
hours.

825
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:42,480
Fuck.

826
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,170
Uh,

827
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,600
this week I'm going to have
Jay Moore on the podcast.

828
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:46,680
We're figuring out when to do it.

829
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:47,620
I've got to call Jay back.

830
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,340
He's doing this thing with Kevin Smith
