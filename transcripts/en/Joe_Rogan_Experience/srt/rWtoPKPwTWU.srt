1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:06,190
No. Oh Shit. Yeah.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,020
Hello Ladies and gentlemen, the
Joe Rogan experience by, Oh, I,

3
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:11,040
just to tell you how we do this,

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,300
we do these two little commercials
before we actually do the podcast,

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,600
but they're very informal and
you could jump in at anytime.

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,570
So if you got something side, don't
hold your time. I don't hear him. Yeah,

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,990
no, no, I don't hear him on a microphone.
Did you hear me now? There we go.

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,390
Ladies and gentlemen,
that is the voice of the Great Tom.

9
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:33,450
We chunk the Joe Rogan experience podcast
is brought to you by the flashlight.

10
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:34,680
If you go to Joe rogan.net,

11
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:37,250
click on the link for the flashlight
and enter the code name Rogan.

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,630
You will save yourself 15% off,

13
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,720
one of the most ridiculous things you
could ever bring up in a conversation.

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,550
But an excellent sex tool and
excellent masturbation device.

15
00:00:47,551 --> 00:00:50,850
And the number one sex toy from mine were
also brought to you by [inaudible] Dot

16
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,290
Com that's o.
N n I t.

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,640
Makers have such delicious
supplements is Alpha brain,

18
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,850
new mood, uh, shroom tech,
sport and trim, tech,

19
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:04,470
immune Alpha brain being my favorite
and the most controversial, what it is,

20
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:08,040
is it nootropic. And, uh, if you're
interested in any of these things,

21
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:11,430
I suggest you Google it first. First
and foremost. Find out what they are.

22
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:16,440
They're essentially vitamins that
enhance your brain's ability to function,

23
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:17,320
enhances your,

24
00:01:17,321 --> 00:01:21,810
your brain's ability to produce
neurotransmitters and it makes your brain

25
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,640
operate more smoothly.

26
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:28,130
There have been a bunch of different
tests on various nootropics. Uh,

27
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,560
we are working on doing a clinical trial,
a,

28
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,210
I guess they call it a double blind
placebo clinical trial with Alpha brain.

29
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,130
As soon as we're set on our formula.
And we should be doing that shortly.

30
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:46,050
And what it does is when any of these
things do is they just enhance your body's

31
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:47,100
health and function.

32
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,450
And we know that all these
various nutrients have been
very effective on helping

33
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:54,120
people. People with
Alzheimer's, for instance,

34
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:57,330
if taken some of these nutrients
and show an improvement on them,

35
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,070
just stands to reason that there are
vitamins and nutrients that that aid your

36
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:04,590
body's function.
And if you take him it would work better.

37
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,690
And that's what these are all about.
If you're interested at all,

38
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:08,400
please go to [inaudible]
dot com and check it out.

39
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,600
We also just recently got in the kettle
bells and I've talked about this in the

40
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:13,620
podcast before.
If there's a,

41
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,890
there's the one workout that I
could do for the rest of my life.

42
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,360
It would be kettlebells cause I think
it's a, it's an awesome workout that's,

43
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,130
it translates directly intellectual life
until like your ability to move shit

44
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:31,020
and your ability to use your body. It's
a, it's a health exercise, you know,

45
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:33,300
because like a lot of
bodybuilding type shit,

46
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:35,670
like can you start doing bench
presses and curls and stuff.

47
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,190
I mean it can make you look
great and get big ass arms,

48
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,280
but the reality is your body
doesn't really work like that.

49
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:43,350
You're not supposed to
like isolate things.

50
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:44,970
I mean you can't if you
want them to get bigger,

51
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,990
but the best thing to do for
athletic performance is to
use your body as a whole.

52
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,710
That's why when you see like MMA
fighters training on, on television,

53
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,980
very rarely will you see
them do isolation exercises.

54
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:01,130
Usually it's throwing sandbags or hitting
hammers into a car tires or you know,

55
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:07,360
it's a, it's climbing ropes.
It's throwing ropes around,

56
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:11,500
doing battle ropes, doing kettle bells,
doing, but like Olympic clean and jerks.

57
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,720
It's all about using your whole body.

58
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:17,140
If you see like an Olympic
clean press like that,

59
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:21,580
guys use an everything man. He's
using his legs, his arms, his back,

60
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,230
his traps.
I mean,

61
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:27,580
it's an incredible full body movement
and full body movements are the ones that

62
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:31,600
really get your body stronger for
like functional things. Like for me,

63
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:35,950
it's Jujitsu. For some people it's,
you know, anything that you like doing,

64
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:39,070
where physical strength comes into play,
kettlebells will enhance that.

65
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,390
It just makes your body stronger.

66
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,410
It's awesome and you can get a good
workout in 20 minutes. We have some,

67
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,630
um, instructionals that are available
at [inaudible] dot com but your,

68
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,770
there's a million different
videos on the Internet.

69
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,440
All of Steve Maxwell stuff is outstanding.

70
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:58,160
He is probably one of the best guys in
the world when it comes to Kettlebell

71
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:02,080
training and he has a bunch of DVDs that
are for sale and he's a great guy too.

72
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:04,900
So if you bought those
DVDs and helped him out,

73
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:07,450
it would be awesome cause he
is the best in the business.

74
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,850
And there's videos online.
You can watch youtube videos,

75
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:11,650
he's got demonstrations online,
he can do,

76
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,920
there's just plenty of workouts that you
could formulate together and you really

77
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:15,790
don't need to go to a gym.

78
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,790
We also sell these battle ropes
and those are those crazy things.

79
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,720
You see Brock Lesnar flopping
around and uh, some of those, uh,

80
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,190
workout things where he's preparing for
fights and a incredibly hard workout.

81
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,580
Whereas used to prepare for
fights. Yeah, I used to.

82
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,170
So I wonder if you translate that.
No. Oh yeah. I'm sure he does. Yeah.

83
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,970
I don't think he stopped and I don't
think he's done. I think you'll be back.

84
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,690
I think this basketball player,
I think who needed to heal up,

85
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,250
he needed to heal up. I have a feeling
he'll be back. He's too fucking good.

86
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:49,750
Too big, too much potential. He
could still do it. They have,

87
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:52,530
but you know what man, you, because
you didn't get over getting kickback.

88
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,420
That and that wouldn't quit me
for the two life. Well, some,

89
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,200
everybody's got a different
path in this life. Anyway,

90
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,910
go check all that shit@ana.com
for the supplements. Only.
Use the code name Rogan,

91
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:06,730
and you'll save yourself 10% off
the battle ropes in the kettlebells.

92
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,700
Seriously about as cheap as
you can sell them. Um, it's,

93
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:13,540
it's very difficult to make and ship
and hire people to move these fucking

94
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,720
things around. Essentially sending
cannon balls through the mail.

95
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,720
But for the supplements, you
can use the code, any Rogan,

96
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:22,150
and you save yourself 10% off.
Also in the supplements,

a hundred percent money back guarantee.

98
00:05:25,561 --> 00:05:28,600
You don't even need to return the
product. He just say, this stuff sucks.

99
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:31,540
This didn't work for me. I didn't
feel it. That's all you need to say.

100
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,560
You get your money back.

101
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:36,820
We're way more concerned with not having
people feel ripped off than we are with

102
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:40,660
making money. And on top of that, like I
said, I use them. I benefited from him.

103
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:45,520
I know Lorenzo Fertitta loves fucking
Alpha brain and stuff has spectacular.

104
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,120
I really enjoy it and we're so confident
that you're gonna enjoy it too.

105
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,270
That we offer 100% money back guarantee.
All right,

106
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:55,600
go to [inaudible] dot Com oh and that's
it. The Great Tommy Chong gets here,

107
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:57,830
ladies and gentlemen.
Oh thanks to

108
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,850
Alienware sponsored MMA fighters
to choose an Alienware shit.

109
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,630
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

110
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,730
We just started using these laptops.
Tommy Chong with this Dalian logo.

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,140
I'm like a child. I liked little
alien heads. Udl stuff. Yeah.

112
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:21,200
I don't know if that's like
a stoner thing. What is that?

113
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,950
I shouldn't be over like little
aliens too. Overgrown kid.

114
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,870
Thank you very much for coming on the
show, man. Submit to me. This is huge.

115
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:34,530
When I was a kid, my parents introduced
me to a Cheech and Chong movies and,

116
00:06:34,531 --> 00:06:37,820
and Cheech and Chong albums when I was,
I was a little kid.

117
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,910
My parents were hippies,
especially my stepdad.

118
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:45,170
My stepdad was a huge hippie and
he loved to Shit, man. And uh,

119
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:49,190
so for me to throw around. Yes. Yeah,
he is. How's he doing? He's doing great.

120
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,940
Does he ever come to the fights
and that? Oh No. He's never,

121
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:56,210
I think they've come to one. This is not
really into that. He's a real hippie,

122
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,490
peaceful guy. Yeah. Yeah.
I think he always felt,

123
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:02,000
it was really weird that I was obsessed
with martial arts and I was a kid.

124
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:04,460
I don't think he really liked it
that much, but he loved you, man.

125
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,910
Everyone's different.
Everyone's different. Yeah.

126
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:10,960
Maybe that's why I pushed the other way.
You know,

127
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:15,800
who really gets pissed off at the
Kettle Bell? The delivery man. Oh yeah.

128
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,350
It's fucking hard.
The people or the ups store,

129
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:20,860
they look at me when I get them in
the mail. Like what fucking really?

130
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:21,980
I didn't even,

131
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,640
I didn't sign up to workout this little
girls that work there and I'm so sorry.

132
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,150
And you know,
and these things are 70 fucking pounds,

133
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:34,520
70 pounds from where cannon pointed to
80 years old. They give you an heavier,

134
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:37,820
they give you, there's dudes out there
that use 120 pounds. I've seen him.

135
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,520
I I trained at a place where they
use kettle bells and this dude,

136
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,120
his name is Mike [inaudible]
and he's all Vegan too,

137
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:48,110
which is cool that he's able to put
on this much mass and be all Vegan.

138
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,560
It's all muscle though. Oh, he's an
animal. And he's got uh, one of the,

139
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:55,080
he's got some of the best DVDs
when it comes to like really like,

140
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,770
like heavy weight exercises.

141
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,760
He throws around some heavy
fucking kettlebells. Yeah.

142
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,490
Like you see him doing these crazy
exercises with like one 20 fives.

143
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:06,710
And that's really hard to do these things.

144
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,150
Well if you've never seen it before folks,

145
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:11,360
it's almost like you kind
of doing gymnastics almost.

146
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:16,130
It's like you're doing different
exercises like kettlebell up or

147
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,220
a Kettlebell is a ball like a cannon
ball with a handle. That's all it is.

148
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,790
Probably was. That's probably
where they got out. I'm sure.

149
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,960
Probably a handle and a, and they use
them right at the turn of the century.

150
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,090
Sandow the strongest man in the world.
He always pulls with this kettlebells.

151
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,180
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

152
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,530
And it's funny how the whole body
building thing went full circle.

153
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,730
It started out, you know, back in the
Greek, uh, days and that, you know, they,

154
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,610
they use animals to work out with, you
know, they pick up a cow until you know,

155
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,750
a calf until it became a cow. Really?
Yeah. Yeah. I mean that's how they trained

156
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,310
bad for the Olympics to
anybody out that working

157
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,850
hard. Who was the first guy to figure it
out? Working hard makes you bigger. Oh,

158
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,280
it goes back to the cavemen.
They take it to that out.

159
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,300
Like cavemen did like push ups and
shit. Oh No, no, no. They did pushups.

160
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,300
Men, you know, like pushing an
animal or running their ass off. No,

161
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,460
it's fight or flight. You
know, the humans were,

162
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,610
we were prey when we were
first shown us on this earth.

163
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:25,110
We've always been praised and it's always
been either we fight or we run until

164
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:28,740
we figured out cities and cat. Damn.
Do we get ahead of the game, the city,

165
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,560
the city, as soon as we figured
out cities. Yeah. Well, you know,

166
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:35,670
as soon as he figured out that
agriculture agriculture first before that,

167
00:09:35,671 --> 00:09:39,900
it was like tribes of people
going around seeing who had what.

168
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:43,170
And what's really crazy is that it's
kind of in dispute now. There's um,

169
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,290
there's a bunch of different,
uh,

170
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,230
scientists now that are pointing to
all these different sites that they've

171
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:50,700
located where they're saying like,

172
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:55,730
it's real possible that like people were
hunter and gatherers like way longer

173
00:09:55,831 --> 00:09:58,140
ago than we think.
Sure.

174
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:02,760
There were cities and civilizations
in between, in between before 10,

175
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:05,910
15,000 years ago. And it probably
wouldn't, it probably went back.

176
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,930
It probably went back to it. Yeah.
Yeah. They've found out recently some,

177
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,760
some new spot. It's underwater.
That's a 8,500 years old.

178
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:19,470
Like Atlanta. He's just a village.
It's a village. That was underwater.

179
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,150
And they say that the,
you know,

180
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:25,590
the earth's sea levels have changed so
much that there's like probably like a

181
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:29,940
bunch of shit, like cities everywhere.
This is underwater. Yeah. And I was like,

182
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:34,890
we have like a weird view of the past.
It's like so piecemeal.

183
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:40,320
It's almost like there's too much stuff
to know and a lot of what most people

184
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:41,830
don't even want to know.
Yeah.

185
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:46,270
I get into some of those conversation
and especially my wife would do that.

186
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,170
Her eyes will glaze over.
Yeah.

187
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,560
A lot of people don't give a fuck
and those aren't looking for, oh,

188
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,280
excuse me for a minute.
And

189
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,370
it all interests me though. I mean,
I'm really like when I was in,

190
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:04,430
I was in Paris a few years ago and
it went to museum of antiquity beyond

191
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:11,871
antiquities where they had the cave
drawings and they had the tools made by

192
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:14,180
these so called cabinet.
Well,

193
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:19,140
the tools he made were made out of,
uh, this Brock to, it's like glass,

194
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:21,420
you know, I forget what
it's called, but anyway,

195
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,280
that you could do major surgeries with
them, they could to get him so sharp. Wow.

196
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,590
And, and the, and the way they formed him,

197
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,500
it wasn't healthloop time or you know,
you know,

198
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:38,460
cave that typical Flintstone image,
you know,

199
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:43,300
these tools were phenomenal.
You could put him today and cs,

200
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,390
I had these tools made,

201
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:50,670
especially by this named artists and
everybody would go, yeah, I believe that.

202
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,170
Wow.
Oh,

203
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,750
I don't know. Million, billion.

204
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,640
I mean really it goes back,
right.

205
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,290
I didn't even think they were
even humans a million years ago.

206
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,050
So it was just a long time ago.
We don't have to say million,

207
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:09,730
let's just say it right back to the,

208
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:14,870
to the beginning. Oh, well what
they found, what they found,

209
00:12:14,871 --> 00:12:18,890
they found a rock that they would
sharpen the spirits with. Uh,

210
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,400
they were actually superior
as long spear tips and,

211
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:24,950
but they would get so sharp because they
were made up some kind of rock glass

212
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:25,530
thing.

213
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:30,120
Yeah, I know. I know. I don't
know what it's called. I don't
remember. But yeah, it's,

214
00:12:30,121 --> 00:12:33,780
it's beautiful. They would chip them
and they would get them like literary,

215
00:12:33,781 --> 00:12:37,560
Razor Sharp, razor sharp and, and
that's how they killed the, the bigger,

216
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,800
bigger animals. What a weird
thing of nature though. I mean,

217
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:44,790
somewhere along the line we must've been
strong enough to kill shit or should we

218
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:45,360
just,

219
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,050
did we just get stronger when we started
eating things and where we vegetarians

220
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:49,884
before that?

221
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:54,000
Well they, they found skulls
of people, ancient people.

222
00:12:54,001 --> 00:12:57,330
And you can see the ones that were
eating, you know, with a big job.

223
00:12:57,331 --> 00:12:59,580
Bones and the big,

224
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,660
there are meat eaters basically.
It is weird

225
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,140
that there are meat eaters
and vegetarians. It is a
weird thing about life,

226
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,670
like things like deer and cows. It's
kind of weird that they don't eat meat.

227
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,060
Like you could just walk right by them.
You don't ever have to worry about that.

228
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,900
But if they were meeting eaters,
you'd be fucked. Oh, you'll be fucked.

229
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:23,110
If a cow was a meat eater, could you
imagine if a cow was trying to eat you?

230
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,600
Cows are fucking huge,

231
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,380
big hippo mouths and they were
just looking to eat people.

232
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,290
We would have a real
fucking problem with cows.

233
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,880
It's weird how there's animals that eat
animals and in his animals that don't do

234
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:39,760
any animals any harm.
And you could basically just fuck them up.

235
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,460
And then the ones closest to
humans are the ones that are there.

236
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,090
The really fucked up. The chimps.
Yeah. Cause they're, they're both,

237
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:49,870
they'll lead meat and they'll eat
vegetables. They'll eat whatever,

238
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:53,430
whatever is there to eat, but they'll,
they'll, they'll find another chimp.

239
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,840
He looks hungry. He looks, he looks a
good list here. His ass apart. Yeah.

240
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:02,140
If they could do cannibalism, I believe
it. Tim Scare the shit out of me.

241
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,440
Yeah. It's about that kid
that got mailed it. Well,

242
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:11,260
he was attacked apparently that
sanctuaries for reintroducing
chimps to the wild.

243
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:16,610
They take chimps that were kidnapped and
forced to work in zoos and for pets and

244
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:18,430
experimented on it.

245
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,600
I may send essentially all champs are
kidnapped if we admit the chimps are

246
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:26,200
intelligent, right. They are. We, we know
they're intelligent. You know, they're,

247
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,920
they're, they're almost people. And yet
we just wheel out to kidnap him and,

248
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,710
and test shit on. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see
what happened to him with we do this tool,

249
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,500
it's kind of fucked when you
really think about it this way.

250
00:14:38,501 --> 00:14:40,690
They get pissed off when
they get a chance, you know,

251
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,250
they get ruthless way of finding
out shit. You got to go. Wow.

252
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,340
Is that the only girl?
Well like the circus people?

253
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:51,650
Yeah. Ever. Ever, ever be
around circus people like Tamer.

254
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,530
I seen a metal lion tamer in Spain.
I guess it was what?

255
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,900
A cocky pitch. No, it was a guy who
was a guy and you could tell me about,

256
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,210
you could, you could, you could tell
that was a generational thing. You could,

257
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,710
you could tell who the lion tamer was.
There's a crowd of people,

258
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,050
you look at the guy with
the big claw marks across.

259
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:17,360
Oh no way. Big Claw marks.
Oh right. And Crosses. Woo.

260
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,770
So you go home and,

261
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:24,500
and you could see the land because the
most exciting part about the circus was

262
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:27,710
watching him on load and
load all the animals.

263
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:32,560
You control these big cats. Wow.
That's part of the Gig, you know,

264
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,540
just when you think you can trust him,
he had turned their back and come.

265
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,810
How many Siegfried and Roy to have to
happen for people wake the fuck up.

266
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,130
And everybody was like, oh, the tiger was
frightened by a feather and the crowd.

267
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,840
And so it grabbed him to drag him
to safety. Ah, I'm not buying that.

268
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,680
That thing's not scared of shit.
It's a fucking giant white tiger.

269
00:15:54,681 --> 00:15:55,491
What are you talking about?

270
00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:58,500
You really think it's scared of a
lady with a feather in our hat? Yeah.

271
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,180
Fuck out of here. There's a tiger
decided to just fuck that dude up.

272
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,050
And that's what they do.

273
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,760
You see the thing on television?

274
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,880
What was it about a Bengal
tiger in this guy was,

275
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,750
they had a little, uh, I was in Thailand,
I think was drawn elephants anyway.

276
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,210
And they were like,
one guy was a gatekeeper.

277
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,360
He had a bamboo pole and this they what?

278
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:25,310
They had this tiger and they watched
him and all of a sudden the tiger Bengal

279
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:30,311
tiger leaped over the elephant
and took one of the guys arms,

280
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:35,330
took photos,
his hands and the whoever was filming,

281
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,280
they can fill me. And, and, and
the, and then the commentators said,

282
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,250
uh,
the animal trainer wasn't hurt bad.

283
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,980
And you could see the guy
who was missing a hand.

284
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:50,980
He was like holding his
hand and screaming. Oh. And
the tiger was like up that,

285
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,850
that high. And then they, then
they, uh, they dissect it, you know,

286
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,450
visually the cat and showed you where,

287
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,520
why it could spring so high, why could
jump so high and, and it showed the tooth,

288
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,790
the teeth, and the reason the
cat could move the way it is,

289
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,480
the way it moves is that the
bones were not connected to the,

290
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,370
to the muscle tissue.

291
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:18,080
And muscle tissue was all separate
and there was no ligaments attached.

292
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:23,180
And so they could, so it's all
one mass of muscle. When that cat,

293
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:28,280
you don't have ligaments,
they showed the, the bones,

294
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,600
the bones aren't attached to
the, to the muscle. Oh Wow. Well,

295
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,460
I don't even know how the hell that
would work. How would that work? Well, I,

296
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,690
Lou would have, uh, how does it work
if the bond is not attach the muscle,

297
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,050
they just, it floats in
Phillips, it's free floating.

298
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:46,960
So the bone is just, just,
it's a ribcage. Ah, see,

299
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,010
see the mo most bones or are around us

300
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:50,940
to protect her.

301
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,200
You nerds are right know
the way we're structured.

302
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,900
But this Bengal tiger,

303
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:03,270
in order to make that leap,
it can't be attached to anything.

304
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:07,400
You know, the, the strength
would tear the ligaments Y,

305
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,920
Z and so, so instead of
it's a design, you know,

306
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,580
and so instead it's like free floating in,
in,

307
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,950
in amongst the rest of the
meat and everything else.

308
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,330
But it was interesting in,

309
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:24,340
in the razor collage that the
claws come out automatically,

310
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,850
like switchblade knives,
they come out and the razor sharp

311
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,050
razor sharp razor sharp people.
Amy,

312
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:35,130
you can't even wrap your head around this
in a house cat and then represent it's

313
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,830
a Bengal tiger with the,
with the fans is so when it,

314
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,340
when it gets to the
neck or something like,

315
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:45,910
like a big Godder baffled or
something, you know, it can do damage.

316
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,230
Oh my God.
But,

317
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:51,010
but it showed that tech cat
jumping up and it took the,

318
00:18:51,011 --> 00:18:53,150
took the guy and the
guy's got a bamboo stick.

319
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,360
No bamboo stick. No hand.
Oh it was, it was awesome.

320
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:04,520
It's, it's pretty clear that those things
are put here to clean shit up. Those,

321
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:08,410
those things are put here to make sure
there's less things. The last big thing,

322
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,620
they're big things.
Everything on earth,

323
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,030
including cockroaches and
ants and everything is,

324
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,240
their whole mission is to
clean shit up. Yeah, it's true.

325
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,170
Isn't it funny how that is? It is
funny. It's like, it's all a big cycle.

326
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Like mountain lions have to kill the
deers and here's eat the grass and yeah.

327
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:33,100
Yeah. And their food, their,
their, their survival for bears.

328
00:19:33,101 --> 00:19:37,870
And it's just, we're, we're so
removed from that as human beings,

329
00:19:37,871 --> 00:19:39,760
especially lately.
And you know,

330
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:43,510
this last portion of society's last
a hundred years or so worried to buy

331
00:19:43,511 --> 00:19:48,511
anything in a grocery store like we've
so removed ourselves from that whole life

332
00:19:48,551 --> 00:19:50,890
and death struggle for meat now meet.

333
00:19:50,891 --> 00:19:54,700
It's just sort of become something he
just by like we've completely removed

334
00:19:54,701 --> 00:19:59,701
ourselves from this primal equation
actually killing the animal.

335
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,980
Actually taking apart the animal.
The weird,

336
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:05,710
like really kind of delusional
about using all the animal. I mean,

337
00:20:05,711 --> 00:20:10,110
how many people are, they eat meat
but they don't like hunting. I don't,

338
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,620
I don't like it makes him sick.

339
00:20:11,621 --> 00:20:14,110
If they see a dead animal on the
road or something, they'll get,

340
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:18,050
they'll turn their stomach. It's
weird, man. That's, that's a delusion.

341
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:22,750
All sort of a weird state of mind.
That was the thing is the commissioning

342
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:26,890
the animals, you know when the,

343
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:31,810
when the eat the me too, you know, it's
not, they'll, they'll go in for the,

344
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,400
for the Oregon's right away.

345
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:37,000
Yeah. Isn't that cool? Yeah. And then
they will leave the rest to ride.

346
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,870
Well that's what they figure
out. Who's the Alpha Wolf? Hmm.

347
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,830
They'll eat the liver of the Alpha
Wolf gets eaten. Deliver. Yeah. Yeah.

348
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,050
There was this crazy, you never
see that documentary, Brian,

349
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,400
that dude to lift with walls.

350
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,340
The guy actually used to plant a kill
and put a liver there and then eat the

351
00:20:53,341 --> 00:20:55,870
liver in front of the wall so that he
would be the one that was in control.

352
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,150
Oh yeah.
Did you ever dance with them?

353
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,190
I don't think it was the same type
of movie. I think he's in his car.

354
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,150
Yeah, it was crazy. And then, uh, he,
he had to go away to fix something.

355
00:21:07,151 --> 00:21:07,900
There was some wolf,

356
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,720
he's a wolf expert and they were saying
Wolf invasion and this other area.

357
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,700
So you got to go to help somebody.
When we came back,

358
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,460
the other wolves that decided
he wasn't the Alpha anymore,

359
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,790
so then he had a beg for forgiveness
and he had to be a Beta and it was

360
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:23,170
terrifying man. No dude was whimpering
and whimpering and doing all this.

361
00:21:23,171 --> 00:21:27,790
He knew lot of the moves in front of
this big fucking a wolf with its teeth

362
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:32,290
bared. It's acute. It was
so horrific. You think,

363
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:37,291
what would it be like to be that man
right now locked in a cage with a wolf who

364
00:21:37,781 --> 00:21:41,990
doesn't want you to be the Alpha anymore
and especially, oh wolf. That brand,

365
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,930
they're so smart and you know,

366
00:21:43,931 --> 00:21:48,910
the guy was just on is just working on
his wits, just trying to keep it together.

367
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,370
While that was going on, I must've
been, oh, he became a wall.

368
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:56,080
He obviously became a of, obviously you
did the right thing and he was going

369
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:02,320
put the Taylor's side turn around.
Amazing man. It was amazing.

370
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,350
He just tucked tail on that
wolf and the wolf accepted it.

371
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,560
It was so frightening to watch, man.
It was really a, it's a gripping thing.

372
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:12,170
You know people on this podcast,
the Twitter people go, man,

373
00:22:12,171 --> 00:22:17,110
he told both fucking scary animals
too much. He said, I'm sorry folks.

374
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,360
I don't mean to have this
as a recurring theme.

375
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:23,170
This is just how I really fucking
think. Okay. They're scary.

376
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,630
That tiger that jumped on an elephant,
it's fucking horrified.

377
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,280
They're like avatar creatures,

378
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,460
but real acrobatic. I mean, yeah,

379
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,040
20 feet. 20 feet. Yeah. It's incredible.

380
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,630
It showed him spring and 20
feet and he went up. Boom.

381
00:22:40,631 --> 00:22:44,890
It's funny to just name that
and gone.

382
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,410
It's so crazy that nature decided
to make something like that. It's,

383
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,120
it's really ridiculous.
It's like everybody else,

384
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:55,960
it's on a bicycle and all of a sudden
this is something that's on a corvette.

385
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:59,830
You know? It's like a, it's total
rip off. It's not fair at all.

386
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,900
Tiger Tiger's not fair at all.

387
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,430
The fact that we can exist in the
same area as tiger's, like those poor,

388
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:11,530
poor people in India. India is a really
scary place for tiger cat attacks.

389
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,820
Yeah.
Oh sure.

390
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,390
There was a documentary where they were
wearing these helmets and they had a

391
00:23:16,391 --> 00:23:20,590
mask on the back of the helmet because
the Tigers don't like sneaking it.

392
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,590
They don't like confronting you.
They want to sneak out.

393
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,980
So if you're looking at them,
they'll leave you alone. No,

394
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:30,640
they figured out after a while that it
was masks, so they started jacking dudes,

395
00:23:30,641 --> 00:23:33,760
even though they had masks on the back
of their helmet. Big Bite on the mouth,

396
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,930
but they have these, they're, they
have armored neck things to keep the,

397
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:41,380
cause the cat always goes to kill you.
The cat. You said something about like,

398
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:45,650
chimps would just eat you bears or just
eat you, but cats kill you. They kill you.

399
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:47,310
And then the EU,
because they have to kill every day.

400
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,780
A chimp can find some bananas and not
have to kill anything for a while.

401
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,230
So they have a different attitude.
That's the same as bears. Yeah.

402
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,140
That's why if you've ever seen
videos of bears eating other animals,

403
00:23:57,141 --> 00:24:01,310
it's horrific because they're eating them
alive. They're just holding them down,

404
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,540
doing them just like they do a salmon.
Yeah. That's their style. Yeah.

405
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:09,530
Hold their head down and start chewing.
The only style of eating,

406
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:13,840
they don't ever kill you. That the
couple that got killed in the tent, uh,

407
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,050
new recorded.

408
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:19,730
They had the recorder on
and no one's ever heard it.

409
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:22,820
Just the one woman on that. Yeah.
It was the grizzly man. Right.

410
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,530
He got chewed up and it's all documented.
Well,

411
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:30,830
not only that would be like six minutes
long. I know. That's what I mean.

412
00:24:30,831 --> 00:24:35,240
It was bad. So it took him six minutes
to find the find the right place too.

413
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:37,430
That's so scary.
But the guy,

414
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:41,750
the guy had a chance to get out of there
that I was out of his mind that I think

415
00:24:41,751 --> 00:24:44,240
that was like a suicide by Grizzly bear.
It's one of,

416
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,930
it's one of my favorite documentaries. If
you haven't seen grizzly man folks, um,

417
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:52,550
it's unintentional comedy at its fine.
Its form. It is, it's amazing. It's like,

418
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:57,440
it is like a beautiful Coen brothers
movie documentary. Like if you,

419
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:00,140
you don't have to change a word of it.

420
00:25:00,141 --> 00:25:04,400
And it would be hilarious if
it was over right. Artificial,

421
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,850
if you like made a mockumentary
and this was the mockumentary,

422
00:25:07,851 --> 00:25:10,850
it would be brilliant. You'd have people
laughing in the theater, you know,

423
00:25:10,851 --> 00:25:15,020
people who, well it's subtle
but it's great. And then
even a little over the top.

424
00:25:15,021 --> 00:25:18,010
But he was trying to convince
people that he wasn't gay. Yeah.

425
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,050
I remember when he was walking with a
camera when the fucking dude is literally

426
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:24,260
walking with a camera going, well, if
I was gay it wouldn't be a problem.

427
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:28,910
Can't find a girl. If I was gay
it would be easy, but I'm not gay.

428
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,600
Like what are you doing? No, no
straight guy walks around with a camera.

429
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:37,610
I'm not gay. That's probably why he was
up there. He had an identity crisis. Yeah.

430
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,480
Poor guy figures out. That's a disturbing
thing man. When you see someone who's,

431
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,920
um, who's a burdened by
their actual who they are,

432
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:48,080
you know who they really are.
You know,

433
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:50,140
they don't want to accept the fact
that they're, well, they're the,

434
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,840
they've been born into this,
uh,

435
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,690
Mesmeric hypnotize society that,
that the,

436
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:01,680
they want to fit in, but they
don't. And the, and so the,

437
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:06,920
like a lot of Caesar's in the
past, you know, cruel bastards.

438
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,870
And most of them were gay,

439
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:14,050
really neuro and the voyage gay or were
they just like anything but just fuck

440
00:26:15,381 --> 00:26:17,300
anything was there.
They were just savages.

441
00:26:17,301 --> 00:26:20,620
Would they just nuts more toward the gay,

442
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,250
the little boy jury signed.
Can you kind of know? Well,

443
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:29,260
so I have always heard that when people
get molested by like a lot of molesters,

444
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,150
and when they catch them,

445
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,870
they find out that they also were molested
when they were young. A lot of them,

446
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:41,630
if you live in this savage Roman time
where everybody's just cutting people up

447
00:26:41,631 --> 00:26:46,170
with swords, how people have morals, how
many people aren't fucking their kids,

448
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:49,890
you know? That's, that's why Christianity
was so important in back in the day,

449
00:26:49,891 --> 00:26:52,710
you know, because it, it, it gave a whole,

450
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:58,180
a small amount of people a moral code.
Yeah.

451
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,430
They needed something to
anybody who think they were,

452
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:04,860
he would have probably taken way longer
without any sort of ideology for people.

453
00:27:04,861 --> 00:27:08,860
Just agree to not shop each other up with
swords who probably take a long time.

454
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:12,390
Well, that was the whole thing. If you had
a knife, you had your sword, you used it,

455
00:27:12,391 --> 00:27:15,840
and there was no, no way of butter.
If you weren't going to use it,

456
00:27:15,841 --> 00:27:18,030
then you didn't hang out with
those people that used it.

457
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,480
It's like you're hanging
out at a bar, you know, the,

458
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:26,590
you know, the rowdies and they have
sores when they get drunk and no,

459
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:30,690
without sores. But you know what I mean?
Nowadays, if they had sores, it'd be,

460
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,110
it wouldn't be too many rounds.

461
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,290
Can you imagine how ridiculous that
would be if people were allowed to,

462
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,640
just so we're,
we're lucky people don't challenge that.

463
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,390
Just start walking around with swords
while they got guns in the south anyway.

464
00:27:42,391 --> 00:27:45,700
Yeah. Oh, a lot of places, a lot of
places have concealed carry. Yeah.

465
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:50,520
And there's an argument for that,
really. Do you think so? You know,

466
00:27:50,521 --> 00:27:55,140
the argument for it is that it's dirty
pee in the pool, guns already out there.

467
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,740
It's not like they're, they're, you
know, like, yeah, but they're like,

468
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:03,450
they're like magnets. So,
yes. In a way. Well, you know,

469
00:28:03,451 --> 00:28:06,850
it's just like the martial arts, just
like martial arts. Same thing, man.

470
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,350
You know how to fight.
For some reason,

471
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:15,351
some guy in the crowd will find you and
challenge you because it's like light

472
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:20,670
understands leg. There's silly people
that have challenged like chocolate Dell.

473
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,680
I have this silly people that like,

474
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:26,460
people really don't realize how
ridiculous some people are out suicide by

475
00:28:26,461 --> 00:28:29,760
suicide. They are just so stupid. I know.

476
00:28:29,761 --> 00:28:32,880
It might actually think they have some
sort of a shot at beating his ass.

477
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,070
That's it sounds like you like,

478
00:28:35,071 --> 00:28:37,090
there's no way everybody knows
that guy's a fucking, you know,

479
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,760
multiple time UFC champion, one of the
best knockout artists ever. Really.

480
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,790
You think guys picking on him get the fuck
out of? No, they really probably would.

481
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,990
There's gotta be someone that dumb. The
world is filled with morons. Oh yeah.

482
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:53,430
Well you know the, they're just
can't help themselves. They're,

483
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:58,070
they're like the wrong way or a tour it,
it's almost like a social Torat thing.

484
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,430
You know, where they can't
help themselves. They have
to say the worst thing,

485
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,660
the wrong thing and get whacked.

486
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,970
And a lot of that is like
what we were talking about.

487
00:29:05,971 --> 00:29:09,210
Just they were abused when they were
raised. They were raised in correctly.

488
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:11,160
Someone didn't give him
the proper amount of love.

489
00:29:11,161 --> 00:29:15,580
Something to does that phone's going on
in the background. You got good ears. Oh,

490
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,520
of course. I'm Deb. So are you going down?

491
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,500
Everything's going on
me. Yeah, man, you're,

492
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:25,870
you're suffering right now from
cancer, right? Is that what you got?

493
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:32,440
Prostate cancer. How, how
far is it slow moving in?

494
00:29:32,441 --> 00:29:35,940
Apparently I've had it,
I guess there were about six years now.

495
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,510
I can tell you exactly when it,
when it happened,

496
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,770
I was in prison and uh,

497
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,210
all of a sudden my Boehner was in,
wasn't responding.

498
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,720
And uh, ever since then I said, oh,

499
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:54,930
there's something wrong and it or the
prostate gets big anyway on an old guys.

500
00:29:55,691 --> 00:29:59,650
And mine was big. And then I went
in and had it checked about three,

501
00:29:59,651 --> 00:30:02,830
four times and they couldn't find
anything. And that's like three,

502
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,150
four times a guys with fingers
up my ass, you know. So it was,

503
00:30:06,151 --> 00:30:10,660
it wasn't that pleasurable. In
fact, one guy told me that joke,

504
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:14,710
he's getting an exam like that
and he told the doctor, he says,

505
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:18,400
well you stick your other finger up my
butt too, because I want a second opinion.

506
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,140
So I got,

507
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:28,150
I got to the point where I had
like for second opinions, you know,

508
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,680
and he said, Ma could be
either, I don't know. I don't
think spa. Yeah, you're okay.

509
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,580
And then my numbers,
my PSA or whatever it is,

510
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:41,950
some numbers that you get in. I just
had my blood checked today and I'll,

511
00:30:41,951 --> 00:30:46,540
I'll know tomorrow if, if it's,
uh, you know, under control,

512
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:51,100
but apparently everybody has camp.
You're born with cancer cells.

513
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:56,470
Everybody has cancer cells. And,
uh, what happens when you get older?

514
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:01,800
The immune system, if it's, if it's, say,

515
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,670
taxed in any way, you know, we're
eating wrong during he wrong, uh,

516
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,160
it will get the cancer will,
uh,

517
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:15,550
increase in and eventually kill
you. But, but a, a cancer cell,

518
00:31:15,551 --> 00:31:20,140
is it just like a Zombie cell? You
know, it doesn't know it's dead.

519
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:25,210
It's hap alive and,
and can only reproduce itself,

520
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,680
which is another Zombie.
And, and so what you do,

521
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:34,810
or in order for the good health, you
know, you, you eat things that, that, uh,

522
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:39,430
antioxidants kill cancer and
you stay away from stuff that,

523
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:42,820
that Pete's cancer because
they're like sugar for instance,

524
00:31:42,821 --> 00:31:47,700
sugar will feed cancer. It
sugar is really the worst, uh,

525
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:52,990
substance on earth. But it's so
delicious. I know. Isn't it funny?

526
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,010
It's terrifying. It's Adam and even,
and she's cake is delicious. You know,

527
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:00,760
a nice piece of cheesecake. I have
sugar to make cheesecakes. Yeah.

528
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,050
You know everything.

529
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:06,810
Or You could get that a cheesecake factory
has said sugar free cheese cake yet

530
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:11,650
that might even be worse
though. Splenda, Splenda Bafour
him. Well, look at, look at,

531
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:16,600
uh, I've worked in a cookie factory for
a while and I couldn't eat the product.

532
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:20,730
Really. It was so chemical up,
there was so much crap in it.

533
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,870
So you saw what I put in and I saw what
went in and I physically could not eat a

534
00:32:25,871 --> 00:32:27,670
cookie. He's there like Oreos
or something. Like, well,

535
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,420
they're Orioles are all
those marshmallow things.

536
00:32:31,421 --> 00:32:34,810
And the only thing I could
eat was a marshmallow.

537
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:40,100
That was kind of organic and that was
that a marshmallows organic? Well, yeah.

538
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,150
I mean I done did it.

539
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,500
It didn't taste as bad as the big
chemical soup, like all the rest.

540
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:51,050
Well, you know, it was like
Lard. They put a big thing,

541
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,150
began a couple of gallons of lard
into the, into the big mixer,

542
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:01,180
like a cement mixer and then pounds
of icing sugar into the mixer.

543
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:06,440
And then you mix it all up and then you
pour it into a hopper and then it goes

544
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:10,580
over top of the cookies and it comes down.
And so that's how you make that,

545
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,290
that's how you make the center of the,

546
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:17,200
the icing small stuff is
kinda organic. Yeah. Yeah.

547
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:20,570
I know it's good for the skin. More
Marshawn was good for the skin can really,

548
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:24,020
yeah, the rub it on your skin. If
it's on the skin is asked like,

549
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,880
like a mask or something.
It was,

550
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:30,050
there's something Lanolin or something
in it that it's good for the skin.

551
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,220
That's interesting. I've never heard
that before. And everything else. Oh,

552
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:37,460
that sugar was horrible. So sugar is
just terrible for your body, period.

553
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,220
It gives you all the day,
all the problems. You know
what per weight, diabetes,

554
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:47,210
Chris Liebing lost a fight because his
body went into like a state of shock

555
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,360
because he ate a bunch of
sugar after the weigh ins,

556
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,110
before his fight with Brian Stann,
like he had really dieted,

557
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,530
he had really cut it down to the wire.
So he was just,

558
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,620
he just have something in his bus.

559
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:02,900
So you gotta think he's been eating
clean watches dive for a long time,

560
00:34:02,901 --> 00:34:06,270
trying to get down to weight. He makes
weight and then eats a bunch of candy.

561
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:11,730
The word he was fucked man.
He couldn't fight. But later
that day I got sick. Yeah,

562
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,680
he's really dead. It was toxic, but
it's amazing. The poison your winter,

563
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:19,040
he didn't throw up. Did you feel, I'm
sure he did. I'm sure he did. He fought.

564
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,260
He just didn't fight like himself.
I mean he still fought well,

565
00:34:21,261 --> 00:34:25,520
but he's just a tough dude.
But he definitely was compromised.

566
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,380
You could tell if you get sugar,
you know, naturally, you know,

567
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,470
fruit or something like that, that's
a lot better for you. You know,

568
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:35,740
bananas or something. There's
always something in there
with the sugar that, that,

569
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,380
that it's good for you. Well, that's
how you're supposed to get sugar, right?

570
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:40,970
That's when you pull it out and
then eat it by itself. It's like,

571
00:34:40,971 --> 00:34:41,781
what are you doing there?

572
00:34:41,781 --> 00:34:46,250
You're not supposed to get that much corn
syrup is in everything that's supposed

573
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:50,390
to be really bad for you. Right? Worst,
absolute worst. Isn't that crazy?

574
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:53,780
I go into whole foods now
shopping because I have,

575
00:34:53,781 --> 00:34:58,781
I'm on a very special diet and I stand
in areas that I can't eat one thing in

576
00:34:59,901 --> 00:35:04,490
that area, like all the
breads, I can't eat bread,

577
00:35:04,491 --> 00:35:08,290
rice, all the starches. What
kind of a diet and you follow it?

578
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,190
It's very green, very
green. Kale and raw foods,

579
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:17,250
carrots and,
and it's actually quite delicious.

580
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:21,870
You make like a Kale shake. Oh
yeah. Oh yeah. I've been making a,

581
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:27,880
I got a Jew through natural juicery
warm driven juicer and it does it.

582
00:35:27,881 --> 00:35:31,670
It's not a speed thing. And so what
it does, it squeezes the juice.

583
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,860
So everything and I juice everything.

584
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,220
Everything they say he should eat
the fiber too. I, um, the shakes,

585
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:41,700
the shakes are good for that.
Yeah, you can just cut them all up.

586
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,940
But somebody had a great idea, uh,
wanting to do this for our message board.

587
00:35:44,941 --> 00:35:46,680
He said he didn't have enough
money for one of those uh,

588
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,800
blenders cause of Vitamix
blenders are expensive. He said,

589
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:54,030
but instead what he did is he juiced his
vegetables first and then took all the

590
00:35:54,031 --> 00:35:58,740
pulp and then through all that in a
blender with the juice. So he like,

591
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:01,560
he made his own smoothie. I'm
like, that's pretty clever. Yeah.

592
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,510
So that way he's getting
all the plant fiber.

593
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:06,510
You're getting the fiber too because
sometimes like when you juice,

594
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,530
like after you go into that bucket where
all the fiber drops and you like pull

595
00:36:10,531 --> 00:36:13,050
the stuff out, like shouldn't I
be eating this tour? You know?

596
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,440
I mean I guess you're getting up massively
concentrated form of nutrients if you

597
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:19,320
just juicing though. Yeah.
But the fiber gives you,

598
00:36:19,321 --> 00:36:23,340
the fibers get too rigid
that no, he's toured. That's
what I'm talking about, dog.

599
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:28,560
We get older. You appreciate a solid shit
you can cook with that. You know that,

600
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:32,490
that bucket of stuff a lot of people
make like vegetables. Sure. Yeah.

601
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:33,810
You could definitely cook with it.

602
00:36:33,811 --> 00:36:38,070
And my wife made carrot cake out of the
carrots. Oh yeah. That I couldn't eat it.

603
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,330
I don't mind.
I don't mind at all.

604
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:47,160
So do you feel better now that you've
all told me I'm the healthiest I've ever

605
00:36:47,161 --> 00:36:51,360
been in my life. That's amazing. And I
got cancer. How long? That's incredible.

606
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,030
That's a great statement. How long has it
been that you've been on this diet? Uh,

607
00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:00,230
two months. Two months. Wow. This, he
may. June. July. Yeah. It's three months.

608
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:05,120
Affects you a lot. Three
months. No, I'm not hungry at
all. One thing of, no, no, no.

609
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,530
I mean it affects you positively this,

610
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,360
oh, totally. Totally.

611
00:37:08,361 --> 00:37:12,880
It just when you got cancer is
the nights are kind of long. Yeah.

612
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:18,880
Yesterday he started telling
scores and realizing,

613
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:23,570
oh know, Ooh. Yeah. I can see
the end of the game. You know,

614
00:37:23,571 --> 00:37:27,680
it's a fourth quarter and
we may not go into overtime.

615
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,000
So. So you start to like
last night I had a bad day.

616
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,560
I've been doing most of my,
uh,

617
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,970
oil hemp oil or cannabis oil at night.

618
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,600
Now explain to people the
idea behind that because a,

619
00:37:41,601 --> 00:37:44,990
I've seen that Rick
Simpson now stuff online.

620
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:49,790
Is he the guy who figured
out that a cannabis oil, one
of the doctors? No, doctor,

621
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:52,290
no, no, no. He's a funny,

622
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:55,400
the old farmer from Nova Scotia.
And how did he know?

623
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:58,670
Right wing farmer or rather than get old,
really old Canadian,

624
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,450
a right wing farmers. He
used to be right wing. Yeah.

625
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,560
Everybody in Canada, it was
right wing. You Kinda, you know,

626
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:10,310
guns and shit like that,
you know. And what he did,

627
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:13,640
he had melanoma real bad.

628
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:17,660
And so I dunno who turned him onto it,
but they said, hey, try something here.

629
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:21,340
Some Hash oil,
put some hash oil liner.

630
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:25,140
And he was doing to the doctor
who's in the documentary, uh,

631
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:30,330
for an operation to get most
of us jar cheek or something.

632
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,660
Well, no, near Rezai. It was near
reside, the skin around design.

633
00:38:34,661 --> 00:38:36,070
It was going be taken out.

634
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:40,930
Oh. And so, uh, he, they put
the hemp oil on it, cured it.

635
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,590
Holy Shit. Sheared it cause your
Twitter spots on his body too.

636
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:47,740
And so he went in with a camera to the,

637
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:52,180
to the doctor and the darker
and then throw them out. Why?

638
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,640
Because they cured cancer.

639
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,230
That's a medical thing, you know,
why would the doctor throw him out?

640
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,330
Because if the word gets out
there charging, you know,

641
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,510
you know how much they charge.
I just paid Twitter need,

642
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,920
do think the doctor himself as a doctor
wouldn't want people to know about that.

643
00:39:08,921 --> 00:39:12,640
If he came to the doctor and this doctor
wouldn't talk to him. The doctor really,

644
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:16,060
he'd went over the test with them and
said, you don't have cancer anymore,

645
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,460
you know, has gone
totally boom, boom, boom.

646
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:22,870
And so he tried to get the conversation
going and this is what cured me.

647
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,670
And the doctor would not hear it.

648
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:28,750
And the receptionist
literally called per security.

649
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,140
Where was this a part of the world? This
was in up in Canada. In Nova Scotia.

650
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:36,480
I could imagine that Nova Scotia. Well,
Vancouver is a very liberal, but uh,

651
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,720
there's a lot of parts of Canada there.
Certainly conservative or at least were.

652
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:45,240
That's amazing thing about these guys.
So what he did, he turned his friends on.

653
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:49,390
I had cancer because there's a whole
bunch of them up there. That lung cancer,

654
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:54,340
prostate cancer. How do you,
is it, it's applied topically.

655
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,260
If you have a cell,
if you've got skin,

656
00:39:56,261 --> 00:40:00,010
you apply it topically and eat it as well.

657
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,220
You eat it for everything else,
like prostrate.

658
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,810
So for skin you don't eat it as well as
put it time engine. You could, you know,

659
00:40:07,811 --> 00:40:11,380
I mean if you, it'd be like
these guys, where does it
doesn't make you high, right?

660
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:15,120
It's not who it does. Oh, it does hit his,

661
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,970
that's what I do it at night. CBDS.
What doesn't make you high, right?

662
00:40:18,971 --> 00:40:22,400
Is that what it is? Is The cannabinoids,
the CBD that doesn't make you high.

663
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:26,830
It's a THC that get you some
dates. Anxiety, separate it.

664
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:31,970
The oral, I mean it's hash oil. Oh,
okay. So it's essentially just hash oil.

665
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:36,200
Hash oil. I call it hemp
oil. And everybody knows what
everybody's been saying. Oh,

666
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:40,660
that's good.
So it is the same thing.

667
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:44,980
So if you, if you take this as just like
eating a strong edible, Ooh, stronger,

668
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,580
strong. So you gotta be very
careful to be very careful.

669
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:50,860
I've had some of those liquid ones,
those little liquid come in like a,

670
00:40:50,861 --> 00:40:55,130
like a little vial. The lose a day
of oil. The lose a day. A Cayenne,

671
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,480
I don't know who I'll lose a day.
Oh yeah.

672
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,150
Well this is what it's like.
I described it.

673
00:41:01,151 --> 00:41:05,980
It's like standing in front of a cosmic
waterfall and you're just able to poke

674
00:41:05,981 --> 00:41:10,150
your head through to the other side and
look at the back behind the waterfall

675
00:41:10,151 --> 00:41:14,320
for little bit. And then there was another
waterfall bag. That's how high you get.

676
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,930
You get reality shot or
I could stay in bed. Hi.

677
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,110
So self examine story. It makes me wanna
apologize to everybody I've ever met.

678
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:28,480
Everybody I've ever met. I'm
so sorry. Whatever I've done.

679
00:41:28,481 --> 00:41:32,740
I know I'm not a bad guy. I swear to
God I get out of bed. You know, I,

680
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,340
I didn't know how to take the medicine.

681
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:39,260
So the, on the video it showed him
take a little dollop on his fingertip.

682
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,940
So I did the same thing.
You know,

683
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:45,941
he sent me a whole kit of the oil
and I in these big plastic syringes,

684
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,990
you know, decorate cakes with, it's
super hard to make though. Right?

685
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:55,010
Apparently they make it next door at the
school. I, they just want an extractor.

686
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:59,890
No, it's, we want people to know where you
are. The feds, they're out their kid. No,

687
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:00,743
they're legally allowed to,

688
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:04,180
there's no such thing.
There's no such thing for real.

689
00:42:04,181 --> 00:42:06,850
If someone in Washington DC is
listening to this and they decide,

690
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:10,180
let's go and fuck those guys up,
there's no law against that.

691
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:14,230
Do you know that that's the federal
law supersedes the state law as far as,

692
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:18,190
well, that's my whole, that's what
happened to him. That's my whole, uh,

693
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:22,950
uh, point of my life now
is to get this shit, uh,

694
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:26,930
legal so I can, so I don't have to
go around the corners, you know,

695
00:42:26,931 --> 00:42:28,910
sneak around to get my cancer mitigation.

696
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:32,800
Yeah. Well when I was a kid.
Okay. And I listened to your, uh,

697
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:36,160
your albums and it was, they
were albums, vinyl, you know,

698
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:41,200
and who would have ever believed the
here would be still in 2012 and all the

699
00:42:43,941 --> 00:42:48,941
children who listened to your shit have
now grown up and are still pass and

700
00:42:49,131 --> 00:42:53,900
ridiculous laws and it's still illegal
and there's still rating pharmacies.

701
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:58,490
I think my, my, my job
on earth, it really was,

702
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:03,320
I was born around the same
time that they made it illegal.

703
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:07,370
1938 was when they made it illegal.
And I was,

704
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:11,730
that's when I came out
and I had been on the,

705
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:16,670
the pot I got turned on when I
was 18 by a Chinese jazz musician.

706
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:21,590
He gave me a Lenny Bruce
record and a joint holy shit.

707
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,100
And how he said enjoy.
And I was, I didn't know,

708
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:29,270
I was really scared of the joint
because I'd never had heard about it,

709
00:43:29,271 --> 00:43:31,970
but it never smoked it.
So I smoked a tiny little bit,

710
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,030
put it up and laughed my ass off,

711
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:37,490
laughed until I was sick
until I was literally,

712
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,700
and then I had my friends come over and
we all listened about it never turned my

713
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:45,620
friends under the joint. No, I kept it
to myself. I didn't want to be the guy,

714
00:43:45,621 --> 00:43:48,150
you know,
he didn't want to turn them all in.

715
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:52,040
Jj had known where I was going to
get another one. Uh, so that, that,

716
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:52,890
so it was that you,

717
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:55,730
it wasn't that you were worried you're
going to turn them into a junkie. No,

718
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:59,250
it was that, it was too good. It was
too good. I don't, I don't want to,

719
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,280
I didn't know where I was
going to get another one.

720
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:05,840
I had no dealer and never even thought
of it, you know? And so it lasted,

721
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:10,010
it was the best ever. It
was the best Thai. It was.

722
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:13,020
What was the,
what was the climate of light back then?

723
00:44:13,021 --> 00:44:18,021
What year was 56 how
rampant was marijuana?

724
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:23,360
Nada. Nothing. No. He Canada, you
could sit in a concert and smoke it.

725
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:26,660
No one would know anything. Really.
They had asked you and you say, yeah,

726
00:44:26,661 --> 00:44:31,250
it's Italian tobacco. And they go,
oh, this smells good. Yeah. Wow.

727
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,010
That's awesome.

728
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,860
Yeah. Yeah. You could walk
down the street. It's Morgan.

729
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,580
And then in the 60s,
uh,

730
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,600
I remember when I was in
Vancouver in the 60s. And uh,

731
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:47,800
the fort,
what singing producing four tops,

732
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,990
the four top, I think it was the four
tops, you know, the, uh, I'll be there.

733
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:56,540
They were playing at the cave,
a little club in the cave.

734
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,490
And of course there are the four
tops and black guys from Detroit.

735
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:02,850
So they smoked a bit joint before
the shoulder, put the ashtray,

736
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:06,990
but the g the roach and an
ashtray and went and did the show.

737
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:10,950
In the meantime, the meat
comes up, finds a joint phones,

738
00:45:10,951 --> 00:45:14,370
a cops first, uh, first the front desk,

739
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:18,780
then the cops came and the
cops got the room next door.

740
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,390
And so when the fort tops
came back from their Gig,

741
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:26,630
they busted in the room and the arrested
before it tops and a Jewish comedian,

742
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:28,680
I forget his name,

743
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:33,050
and it took him down there and the tops
are telling his story after, you know,

744
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,560
it didn't last.
I mean,

745
00:45:34,561 --> 00:45:38,610
Barry Gordy of Motown sent the
money or whatever it was in it.

746
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:42,090
It went away pretty quick, you know,
but you can get shit to go away.

747
00:45:42,091 --> 00:45:47,010
Back then there was no TMZ or no,
yeah, no, you could. That disappeared.

748
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:49,410
But the funny thing was
they took him to jail.

749
00:45:49,411 --> 00:45:53,370
They took the four tops to jail with
the comedian and the comedian that had

750
00:45:53,371 --> 00:45:55,050
nothing to do with it.
He just,

751
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,970
he came up to the room for a drinkers
in the community. He was saying, Hey,

752
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,980
I'm not what these guys, come on, look at
me, look at me. Do I look like a four top,

753
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:08,010
I'm not the photography.
I'm sorry Joe [inaudible].

754
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:12,210
The Joe Pesci played that guy in a movie.
It was,

755
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,010
it was very fun. The climate back then
was much more innocent. It was innocent.

756
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:19,240
But then if where we live in at the time,
well,

757
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:24,180
I was in Calgary when I first got stone
Calgary first time and that's when I

758
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:26,730
quit school. I mean, I'm
going to in a couple of weeks.

759
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:29,850
Everything they said about Calgary.
Oh, I'll turn you on like Calgary.

760
00:46:29,851 --> 00:46:33,720
I've been up there before. Did the Jack
Singer concert. I'm doing two shows there.

761
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:34,500
Oh,
we're awesome.

762
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:39,020
Right before the UFC at the
Jack Singer concert hall did
general, Yeah. Yeah. It's,

763
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:40,410
Oh, it's beautiful. Yeah.

764
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:44,610
Last time we did it and we
actually had people on the stage,

765
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,430
they fucked up at the ticket
somehow and put them on stage.

766
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:51,660
We put 50 people on stage with us. It was
crazy. It was great. There was so nice.

767
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:56,120
You didn't even feel weird about it.
It's singer. He's a rich guy. Yeah.

768
00:46:56,190 --> 00:47:01,050
All those fun place. Belzberg. Yeah. I
grew up in Calgary. Oh. It was my shit.

769
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:05,010
That was my, she come to the UFC there
and a couple of weeks I could hook you up.

770
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:08,360
Yeah. I want to go. Do you want
to go? Wow. Let's see what I see,

771
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,210
how my cancer schedule illusion. Well,
if you feel well and you feel up to it,

772
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,030
let's not that,
not that at all.

773
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:17,220
It's just [inaudible] they got to
do to doctors and all that shit.

774
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:20,480
Now are you using chemotherapy
or no? No, no, no.

775
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:24,930
You just use my cancer.
My cancer is this very slow.

776
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,930
In fact, it's kind of weird what
they see to about my cancer.

777
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:32,410
They say usually we don't tell the guy,
you know? Yeah. Your religion. Yeah.

778
00:47:32,411 --> 00:47:36,850
Usually we don't tell that guy
because by the time the cancer is bad,

779
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,560
you'll be done at some other causes. No
Shit. So that's, that's one of the things,

780
00:47:41,561 --> 00:47:46,370
but I, you know, that's kind
of creepy that you're done
so well. They do that well.

781
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:49,780
How many times that we will die
before they get jaded? Yeah.

782
00:47:49,781 --> 00:47:52,690
Well you don't have to
change your lifestyle. See,

783
00:47:52,691 --> 00:47:55,890
I got a straight doctor
and I got a very hip, uh,

784
00:47:56,470 --> 00:48:00,120
when a natural path and the
struggle to say gay dog,

785
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:05,290
the street, the street doctor, that's
why he wanted to test me eight times.

786
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:10,990
The straight darker. He kinda like,
Hey, whatever you want to do, go ahead,

787
00:48:10,991 --> 00:48:15,430
don't worry about it. But
here's some pills. Take these
pills are very expensive,

788
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:20,110
but they'll keep your prostrate from
growing and it will keep the cancer cells

789
00:48:20,111 --> 00:48:24,190
from growing in. So you'll be
okay for awhile. Side effects,

790
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:28,550
you might get Alzheimer's from it, but
that's down the line too, you know. So.

791
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:31,570
So my natural path, he
was the opposite. He said,

792
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:36,600
well yeah I take those pills but get
off them as soon as you can and uh,

793
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,920
and here's all this natural stuff
you take like green tea supplements,

794
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,350
not the green tea in a glass,
but condensed green tea is really good.

795
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:50,650
And there was all sorts of other stuff
because of the strong antioxidant,

796
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:55,180
what it is. Yeah, it's all in. Now if you
take the amount of oil, a lot of fish oil,

797
00:48:55,181 --> 00:48:59,650
a lot of Krill oil and a lot of good
oil and that's because you keep your,

798
00:48:59,651 --> 00:49:03,610
the Bones, everything else oiled and
the cancer cells can't stick to it.

799
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:07,920
And so the way that it works that
way, yeah, that's what sells.

800
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:12,870
We'll stick to things like are oiled up
wrestler. Yeah, like no internally. Oh,

801
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:16,930
you got to oil yourself internally.
And that's why water.

802
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:20,830
Why to be very careful with your water
intake because that's what happened to me.

803
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:24,100
I wasn't drinking enough water,
so dehydrated all the time.

804
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:29,130
And so I was a water deficient
and hydro would call deficient.

805
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,670
How would drink tea? I drink all this
other stuff, you know, sodas and stuff,

806
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:37,270
you know. But I really wonder if
you work out, you got to rehydrate.

807
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:41,980
It really wasn't water with water or
coconut juice is really good to coconut

808
00:49:41,981 --> 00:49:44,350
water rather. That's a lot.
A lot of electrolytes in it.

809
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:48,940
But I went to a doctor recently and
I found out that it was three pounds

810
00:49:48,941 --> 00:49:53,020
dehydrated because I, I've worked out
the night before and I'd, you know,

811
00:49:53,021 --> 00:49:56,140
I had eaten, I thought I'd drank
enough, but he's like, you know,

812
00:49:56,141 --> 00:49:59,320
you can look at it when they do like a
body mass index thing on you look at,

813
00:49:59,321 --> 00:50:03,220
say like you're dehydrated. Yeah.
Yeah. And so, so for cancer,

814
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:07,870
cancer loves the hydro love. You fucked
up. Oh BC they like your weekend,

815
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:11,830
we'll figure it out that your,
your, your immune system,

816
00:50:11,831 --> 00:50:16,270
your immune systems so busy
with everything else. And
I'll tell you another, uh,

817
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:21,330
I went to another healer and he gave me
a great tip I'll pass on to you and your

818
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:26,650
listeners is one way to cleanse
your liver and your kidneys,

819
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,230
which really just should be
cleansed as much as you can.

820
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:33,900
I heard it's a blowout weekend with
Jack Daniels. That's what I heard.

821
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:35,723
That's the best thing.

822
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,680
That's after I heard your liver
needs a workout every now and then.

823
00:50:39,681 --> 00:50:43,790
You just got to put your liver through
the way you combine will you do it?

824
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:48,770
You get a bag of Celtic salt, sea
salt, sea salt, Celtic Sea salt,

825
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:53,320
rock salt. But it has all the
other minerals in it too. Huh?

826
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:56,270
And you get as much a gallon or so water.

827
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:01,670
Preferably not distilled, but you
know, whatever. Spring water spring.

828
00:51:01,671 --> 00:51:05,150
What is he in a pure, pure
water. Pure water. You know,
you don't want to tap water.

829
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:06,740
Right? And, and what you do,

830
00:51:06,741 --> 00:51:11,741
you put a pinch of sea water in a glass
and you drink it and you drink of salt,

831
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:17,360
pinch of sea salt in the glass,
drink it down and drink.

832
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:20,300
Try to drink as much as
you can with the sea salt.

833
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:25,880
And the thing is assault will make you
thirsty. So its impact. That's what,

834
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:30,940
that's why we love salt so much
because salt makes the thirsty,

835
00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:36,131
the body needs water and the body will
do anything it can do to get water.

836
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:41,000
Once you put salt in it,
normally, normally your,

837
00:51:41,001 --> 00:51:45,650
your body needs water and so it'll do
whatever in the salt makes you drink more.

838
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:50,330
And when you put salt in, in like the
Stillwater, the fresh spring water,

839
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:55,340
it cleanses your whole
body. You could have, um,

840
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:57,930
you know, it cleanses, like I say,

841
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:02,950
could act like an animal that sometimes
that it'll clean Jello but that you

842
00:52:04,281 --> 00:52:08,630
should do that. Do that. At least
I'm doing it at least once a month,

843
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:13,430
once a month. And you, when you
define a pinch, what we say that is,

844
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:15,620
you think that's like a,
just a tiny speck.

845
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,590
You don't want to put too much it though,
right? You gotta be careful, right?

846
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:24,530
Too much. It just, it's too much. Well,
it isn't a dangerous at a certain point.

847
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,420
Well, how much, I know one of the wider,

848
00:52:26,421 --> 00:52:30,520
the wider and the lobby softic salt.
It can see.

849
00:52:30,521 --> 00:52:34,760
So it can't be a iodized,
right refined in any way.

850
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:36,650
It has to be sea salt.
Because of what you're doing.

851
00:52:36,651 --> 00:52:40,190
You're putting minerals back into your
system and especially back into your

852
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:40,671
kidneys.

853
00:52:40,671 --> 00:52:45,380
Just see that's where you're deficient
because none of the supermarket foods

854
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:49,730
give you minerals.
That's why we have a supplements.

855
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,920
You're talking about siblings.
We're just getting minerals.

856
00:52:51,921 --> 00:52:54,980
That's all we're basically doing.
And Sea salt is the cheapest,

857
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:58,120
the easiest and nicest way
to get your minerals. Well,

858
00:52:58,121 --> 00:53:01,790
another thing is a lot of
people don't realize that your,

859
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,190
your land that you grow things on,

860
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:08,450
he can't really keep growing things
on the same spot forever. No,

861
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,170
you deplete the minerals mineral soil.

862
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,570
And so then your vegetables become
mineral deficient and that's why you know,

863
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:18,500
you, the leafy vegetables
don't look as green and rich.

864
00:53:18,501 --> 00:53:21,980
And if they don't look like green and
ranch, they're probably not as healthy.

865
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:26,060
And in the end, the non
organic fertilizer, you know,

866
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,440
that's so bad for the whole system.

867
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:31,360
What would it really creeps
me out as the soul. Um,

868
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,940
Monsanto thing or Monsanto is
creating these suicides, seeds that,

869
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,610
you know, they, they, they work
once and then they don't make,

870
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,520
they don't make seeds. Like,
you know, if you get it tomato,

871
00:53:41,521 --> 00:53:45,180
you can't take it tomato cdot out and try
to plant that seed, that seed useless.

872
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,530
Killed them.

873
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:49,560
I love what they're doing because what
they're doing is they're identifying

874
00:53:49,561 --> 00:53:54,200
themselves. Yeah. So we can
look at it. You go home.

875
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,990
Okay. Let me think. Give me the
organic. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, that's,

876
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,320
that's what they did with the coconut.

877
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:05,370
The Monsanto was the one that ran the
coconut. Uh, people had a business.

878
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,360
Did you know that? No, I have no
idea. Well, the coconut, coconut,

879
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,890
everybody use coconut oil. And it was
the healthiest oil on the planet. I mean,

880
00:54:13,891 --> 00:54:17,040
to cook with the Ashworth
to, you know, grow your hair.

881
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:19,690
I remember when they said it was bad
for you. Remember that? Well that's,

882
00:54:19,691 --> 00:54:21,750
that was one Santo real.

883
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:26,630
They were saying that the fat will give
you heart attacks and clogged up the

884
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,450
cholesterol bullshit. It's just the
opposite. Right. It's really good.

885
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,310
It's really good cooking oils. I one of
the healthiest things you can eat. Uh,

886
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:38,490
I got a great test now because I've got
a natural naturopathic doctor and he

887
00:54:38,491 --> 00:54:42,180
says, what are you eating? And I, and I
name off certain things and you'll say,

888
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,970
don't eat that. Don't eat
that. I said, coconut,

889
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:49,890
eat as much as you want it.
The, especially the, um,

890
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,940
the coconuts from Thailand,
you know,

891
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,420
those are the ones that have the
most delicious milk with a white,

892
00:54:54,421 --> 00:54:58,650
like a really stupid white silky.
Yeah. Yeah. The Thailand is good.

893
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:01,770
They're all good. It's all good.
They were Filipinos. I mean,

894
00:55:01,771 --> 00:55:04,530
that's why the the
Polynesians, uh, you know,

895
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:07,390
their skin so beautiful and they got hair,
you know,

896
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:11,100
you don't such a healthy fruit to
eating the actual coconut itself.

897
00:55:11,101 --> 00:55:12,990
So good for you.
And did you know here,

898
00:55:12,991 --> 00:55:17,991
here's the fact about a coconut that I
didn't know about until my artist's son

899
00:55:18,221 --> 00:55:22,660
in law told me. But the
coconut itself is, uh, is uh,

900
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,450
insecticide.

901
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:29,850
Really it admits things that kill insects,

902
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,820
Huh? The outside the
outside, the whole plan,

903
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:35,920
the whole plan can help the planet itself.
It's an insecticide.

904
00:55:35,921 --> 00:55:39,540
It's an insecticide. And that's one of
the reasons that if you use coconut oil,

905
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:44,360
you know, keep the mosquitoes away.
No Shit. That stuff works. Yeah, yeah,

906
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:47,580
yeah. I've never heard of that
before. Work as good as off though.

907
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:50,280
[inaudible] off stinks, but that's
shit works. You know what I mean?

908
00:55:50,281 --> 00:55:54,990
I don't want to get kind of bed
because I'm being crunching. No,

909
00:55:54,991 --> 00:55:58,230
but the insects see the
coconut plant itself,

910
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:00,960
it took a few years to develop this,

911
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:04,960
but they needed a defense against
insects and birds and, and,

912
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:07,620
and imagine a coconut shell.

913
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:11,970
What a perfect home that would make
for how many birds? Everything. Yeah,

914
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
but you notice they're,
they're left alone.

915
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:18,500
They got this big leafy thing around
her that protects it too. But the,

916
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:23,100
but the plan itself is an insecticide.
It's pretty cool. It's amazing.

917
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:24,070
A coconut exists

918
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:25,180
at all.
I mean,

919
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:29,140
isn't it amazing that you get to chop
through all this bullshit to get to this

920
00:56:29,141 --> 00:56:32,590
delicious center and look at it?
The water is and look at the soil.

921
00:56:32,591 --> 00:56:36,070
It grows in sand, sand,
sand. So strange. Yeah.

922
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:40,150
A strange fucking alien plant.
That's so good for you. Yeah.

923
00:56:40,151 --> 00:56:42,970
That's so good for you.
Good for you. You can use,

924
00:56:42,971 --> 00:56:46,060
most of them are fortunate thing
about Americans is our diet.

925
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:50,500
So many people just are not eating the
proper amount of nutrients in vegetables.

926
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:54,550
Well, that explains for the psychotic
behavior of people a little bit.

927
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:58,480
Work is also to culprit. The people just
go crazy and I want to work anymore.

928
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:00,670
You know, it's fucking, we
don't, we don't work, man.

929
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:03,760
You and I haven't worked at a long time.
And when you work,

930
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:07,090
you know you're doing something you
don't like and you're doing it all day.

931
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:07,930
And that's,
most of us,

932
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,780
most of our country is filled with people
that are working well. The surviving,

933
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:15,630
you're, you're, you're surviving.
You know? That's why the, uh,

934
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,760
the immigration thing is such a thing,
you know,

935
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:22,250
because it's just people
migrating up where the food is at.

936
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:25,030
Work means food. Absolutely.
That's what it is. Sure.

937
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:29,700
And that's why these immigration
laws are kind of ridiculous because,

938
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:34,170
you know, it just puts people
in a position where they can

939
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:37,640
balancing mean to other people.
Well, it's a crazy situation anyway.

940
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:39,060
The only reason why it exists at all,

941
00:57:39,061 --> 00:57:42,560
it's because we don't have jet
packs and portable helicopters.

942
00:57:42,561 --> 00:57:45,910
You know what I mean? It's so easy to
fly around, so it's not, you know, if we,

943
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:48,380
if everyone had a fucking plane,
there would be no countries.

944
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:51,260
It would be ridiculous because you can
just go anywhere you want. You know,

945
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:54,200
they would, they would get over the fact
that I can't control people. You can,

946
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:54,981
you could,
you know,

947
00:57:54,981 --> 00:57:57,830
they would have to control the airports
and then people would rebel, you know,

948
00:57:57,831 --> 00:57:58,880
and take the reports back.

949
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:03,040
Everything in America is, is
all front. It's all upfront.

950
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:07,720
It's all a facade. There's nothing
real, you know, like when you,

951
00:58:07,721 --> 00:58:11,320
when you get searched,
when nine 11 just happened,

952
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:13,300
I was in,
uh,

953
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:18,040
flying to somewhere Houston or are
applying to Argentina was somewhere,

954
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:23,020
but anyway, flew into Miami. Okay.
And you know, all those security,

955
00:58:23,021 --> 00:58:27,160
they got the bags go into the machines
and your designs. Okay, well Miami,

956
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:30,970
uh, all these flights from
the rest of the world,

957
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:33,250
they just unload the baggage

958
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:39,990
beside the machines and people just come
in and pick up their baggage when they

959
00:58:40,341 --> 00:58:44,450
go into the next,
next flight or in other words,

960
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:49,510
the third world country. And so
we're protected everywhere. La,

961
00:58:49,511 --> 00:58:53,110
New York, or protect it, protect per
day. Then you go down to the butter.

962
00:58:53,111 --> 00:58:56,620
That country, you know, Miami, you'd think
they would have some prediction there.

963
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:01,450
None. None. You could, you could walk. It
was a little barrier. You Walk Around, Oh,

964
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:02,800
there's my bag over there.

965
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:06,100
Or there's somebody back or let's
put this explosive over there.

966
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:07,740
No one would have,

967
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:11,350
are you given terrorists ideas?
I won't. You tell him him.

968
00:59:11,351 --> 00:59:15,340
Where's a good spot to attack? I'll tell
you how to sneak in the country. Wow.

969
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,270
Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico.
Yeah. Yeah. How's that?

970
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:22,040
You can get a passport in

971
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,230
the Dominican Republic.

972
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:29,920
Then you can swim over to a or get dropped
off and swim to Puerto Rico and then

973
00:59:32,481 --> 00:59:36,680
you dress up very whatever, you know,

974
00:59:36,681 --> 00:59:41,270
and then you got your passport and your
green card and you get on a plane for

975
00:59:41,271 --> 00:59:45,080
anywhere in America. Really? Is that easy?

976
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:48,530
That easy mastermind. You should
write books on how to break the law.

977
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:52,100
I know a lot of them, but I, no, I,

978
00:59:52,101 --> 00:59:54,590
was there anything that you think
that there should be no borders?

979
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:55,200
Is that what you think?

980
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,740
You think that people should be
able to absolutely travel anyway.

981
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:00,050
They didn't want a part, you know,
people would seem to me, you know,

982
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:04,630
well if we legalize it and we
could tax, and I said, no, no. Why?

983
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:09,290
Why make work for yourself?
Just legalize it.

984
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:12,090
Just eliminate the DEA? No. What'd you do?

985
01:00:12,091 --> 01:00:15,800
Did transfer everybody
from DEA to secret service.

986
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,150
They obviously need some,

987
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:22,540
some corrupt people in there and
your luminate the DEA so and so.

988
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:28,160
You make it Yay. And maybe, how
about using them for something good?

989
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:32,470
How about you use them for some sort of
an educational program or something like

990
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:35,630
that that they couldn't work?
He is, they're basically cops.

991
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:38,240
You'd have to give them another
cop shot. No, no, they're, they're,

992
01:00:38,241 --> 01:00:40,760
they're criminals. They're,
they're beyond cops.

993
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:44,660
They're not just because you feel
like the DEA, their total criminals,

994
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:48,290
they're total criminals. And if
you're not, you're not in the DEA,

995
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:53,210
you have to transfer out because
you can't have one bad cop. And,

996
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:57,890
and now when you mean the really corrupt,
they're totally corrupt.

997
01:00:58,130 --> 01:00:58,810
When we,

998
01:00:58,810 --> 01:01:02,390
when we don't hear about the money that
remember all the money they used to find

999
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:03,710
the marijuana.
Yeah.

1000
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:06,050
And now they're saying they're
selling more marijuana than ever.

1001
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:08,450
We don't hear about the but
the money anymore, do we?

1002
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:12,670
We don't hear about the millions of
dollars in drug money. That's just,

1003
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:16,490
that gets confiscated. It gets confiscated
sitting in the court until the trial.

1004
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,110
You don't hear about what
did they do with that money?

1005
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:22,550
They split it amongst themselves
and they either they take the,

1006
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:26,900
you notice it and also don't have
to account for it. Like when,

1007
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:31,850
when for real, for real, they put it
in their pocket. They split it up 100%.

1008
01:01:31,851 --> 01:01:36,780
There's no doubt about it there. I can, I
can name, I'll name a, an instance. Okay.

1009
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,260
I won't name the guy's name,

1010
01:01:39,261 --> 01:01:43,040
but he's a friend of mine from
Vancouver and he was done it here.

1011
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:47,570
He's working for the hell's angels.
I can say that name because people know.

1012
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:53,560
And his job was to deliver
the load of the BC bud,

1013
01:01:55,240 --> 01:02:00,240
which he drove down in a u haul
trailer right to a safe house.

1014
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:05,990
And then he drives home and uh,

1015
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:10,670
he just,
he got ratted out.

1016
01:02:10,671 --> 01:02:14,720
Someone ratted him out. You know, it
could have been one of the angels to,

1017
01:02:14,721 --> 01:02:15,160
you know,

1018
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:19,910
you never know because they
control a lot of the borders up in

1019
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:22,480
Canada. Anyway. Uh,

1020
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:27,300
the DEA arrested him in front of the
Grumman's theater restaurant him.

1021
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:32,010
Yeah.
Just him and handcuffed him.

1022
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:36,870
And they had the big trailer of a weed.
What she showed me,

1023
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:40,260
he showed me the weed and then he,
uh,

1024
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:46,170
he gets taken to jail and he's in jail
and they won't let him use the phone or

1025
01:02:46,171 --> 01:02:50,340
anything. And all the, they interrogate
him, they say, where's the safe house?

1026
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:55,640
So he gave up the safe house and
then about maybe a two hours later,

1027
01:02:57,140 --> 01:03:02,100
the jail who comes in and says, okay, you
can go kicked his ass out of the jail.

1028
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:07,140
They just let them go and took the
money, let him go. He took the money,

1029
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:11,940
took the weed they took to my the way
and let him go. And that's one guy.

1030
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:15,060
That's one guy.
Is that what's going on now?

1031
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:18,510
That's what these raids are all
about. Just the money, ground raids,

1032
01:03:18,511 --> 01:03:23,030
razor new for newspapers is
for the, for the, uh, you know,

1033
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:25,890
the pressed and let them know
that so they can get their budget.

1034
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,630
They get their billion dollar budget.
You know,

1035
01:03:27,631 --> 01:03:30,900
what's disturbing is that the
money that could be given to them,

1036
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:36,060
rightfully through taxes, the money that
could be given to the state, you know, is,

1037
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:38,590
is pretty substantial.
If, if they made it legal,

1038
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:43,770
quite substantial going to really grow
it themselves. Some people are saying,

1039
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:47,190
but you don't need to be able to,
you don't need to invent a new system.

1040
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:51,690
We got a system in place is called
sales tax. If you open a store,

1041
01:03:51,691 --> 01:03:55,950
you pay taxes, that's all you do. If
you want to buy a bag of weed, you like,

1042
01:03:55,951 --> 01:03:58,920
you buy a bag of flour, it's the same
thing and you should be able to grow it.

1043
01:03:58,921 --> 01:04:01,260
Like he grew up fucking tomatoes
so you can grow your own tomatoes,

1044
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:04,710
you should be able to grow your
own weed. You can, you can end.

1045
01:04:04,711 --> 01:04:05,790
The only trouble is,

1046
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:09,440
is that, uh, because
of the greed involved,

1047
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:14,050
that's why it's still illegal
because not only, not only that, the

1048
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:19,830
people that the hemp, uh,
would replace, you know,

1049
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:21,330
the forestry

1050
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:21,921
well,

1051
01:04:21,921 --> 01:04:25,240
that's the most ridiculous things that
hemp isn't even psychoactive and it's

1052
01:04:25,241 --> 01:04:28,550
illegal. Yeah. Because of the paper
industry. And the pharmaceutical

1053
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:32,640
mystery for the pain relief. There's
a show on TV yesterday about, uh,

1054
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:35,790
the marijuana pain thing
and they can't come up.

1055
01:04:35,791 --> 01:04:40,710
The pharmaceuticals cannot
match a pot for what it does.

1056
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:44,250
They cannot, and they've tried and
tried and tried. They cannot match it.

1057
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:45,160
Well,

1058
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:48,730
you gotta think that there's plants that
we have a symbiotic relationship with

1059
01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:50,560
and we know that there's a long,

1060
01:04:50,561 --> 01:04:53,860
long relationship that people
have to eating cannabis.

1061
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,740
And we know that eating yet where
it doesn't even get you high,

1062
01:04:56,741 --> 01:05:00,460
when you just eat the plant doesn't get
you high. It's incredibly good for you.

1063
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:05,380
That's by the way, the, the, the
juice people are juicing leaves. Yeah.

1064
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:08,620
Yeah. And for cancer. And
that's what I'm going to,

1065
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:12,790
when I find out and the leaves, you
don't smoke the leaves anyway. Right.

1066
01:05:12,791 --> 01:05:17,470
So when you, I used to use the smoke,
the leaves, but it's not as psychoactive.

1067
01:05:17,471 --> 01:05:21,140
Right. So that was powerful. There
was a, there's a thing about, uh,

1068
01:05:21,170 --> 01:05:25,440
sort of like a memory body memory.
So for smoking,

1069
01:05:25,441 --> 01:05:29,640
it's like you're smoking a bad joint or
we used to joke about it and say there's

1070
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:32,230
weed was only good for selling to military

1071
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:38,070
because then if they got caught,
they get tested there.

1072
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:42,220
There's nothing in their blood.
They would be okay, but no weed.

1073
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:46,950
I don't think it should be taxed
other than just just decriminalize it.

1074
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:52,090
Leave us alone, you know, and then
the economy will, will, will blossom.

1075
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:54,640
You'd be the guy to answer this.
When you hear people say, well,

1076
01:05:54,641 --> 01:05:57,080
the marijuana today,
it's not like the marijuana book.

1077
01:05:57,430 --> 01:06:02,430
Is that totally true or is it that what
I've read is that most of the marijuana

1078
01:06:03,221 --> 01:06:05,470
back in the day was not as
strong as it shit that's today,

1079
01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:08,020
but every now and then you'd get
some shit that blow your mind.

1080
01:06:08,021 --> 01:06:12,280
It's just as good as, I'll tell you
an analogy that kind of covers it.

1081
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:17,590
It's like the 15 foot high diving
board. Okay. When you're a little kid,

1082
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:20,230
they had those crazy long way down.

1083
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:24,820
Then when you hit a young boy, ah,
this is nothing. I can go 30 feet.

1084
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:29,770
Then as you get older and older and older,
that 15 feet plan the, you're not even,

1085
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:32,200
you're not even walking
up the stairs anymore.

1086
01:06:32,810 --> 01:06:37,570
And it's the same as a pot part has not
changed. It's impossible to change it.

1087
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:41,910
It's a strong, uh, back then
as it was, as it is here,

1088
01:06:41,911 --> 01:06:46,660
you can still get whack wheat today.
Sure. I imagine I've never had it,

1089
01:06:46,661 --> 01:06:50,470
but never had terrible weed.
He's had Labrador before.

1090
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:56,330
I've had my share.
I haven't had bad weed.

1091
01:06:56,740 --> 01:07:00,390
I can't even do it. I think there's
a great difference between, um,

1092
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:04,260
like really crap we'd, and
really how you sure. Sure.

1093
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:06,850
How much of it back in the day,

1094
01:07:06,851 --> 01:07:08,620
like when you were doing
those Cheech and Chong movies,

1095
01:07:08,621 --> 01:07:12,220
how much of it was like high grade?
Was it hard to get high grade stuff?

1096
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:13,570
Not really,
no.

1097
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:17,860
The Vietnam War took care of all the
high grade we were getting is coming in

1098
01:07:17,861 --> 01:07:22,360
from this to ty. We'd like
a sativa. Sativa. Yeah.

1099
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:27,400
That's the power for intellectual.
We'd put put you on your butt,

1100
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:30,910
but you on your ass. But it makes
your brain makes of brainwork.

1101
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:35,590
The Sativa. I mean all
that. It's very creative.

1102
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:36,970
All the good weed.

1103
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:39,970
That's one of the really unfortunate
things about the fact that it's illegal

1104
01:07:39,971 --> 01:07:41,830
that most people don't even
know what the difference is.

1105
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,930
They don't even know that an indycar was
like much more of a sleepy sedatives,

1106
01:07:45,931 --> 01:07:48,460
sort of a feeling,
much more relaxing,

1107
01:07:48,461 --> 01:07:51,130
but in a sativa as a totally
different trip. It's,

1108
01:07:51,131 --> 01:07:55,150
it's almost like a totally different
drug. Yeah, it, and it looks the same.

1109
01:07:55,151 --> 01:07:59,710
It smells at seminar, but it's, it's a
completely figured out. Figured this out,

1110
01:07:59,711 --> 01:08:04,450
man. I mean, I've got cancer. You
can't get any worse than cancer.

1111
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:09,460
Oh, that we does for you. It cures.

1112
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:12,460
It kills cancer cells.
That's amazing.

1113
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:16,850
It's just blows blows me away. It's
hard to wrap your head around it really.

1114
01:08:16,851 --> 01:08:17,191
I mean it's,

1115
01:08:17,191 --> 01:08:20,460
it's something that you can bring up
every day because it almost makes no sense

1116
01:08:20,461 --> 01:08:24,260
it that you get repetitive after a while
because it's so ridiculous that it's

1117
01:08:24,261 --> 01:08:28,710
illegal. When you stop and
look at it, it's like this
is, it's a magical plant. It,

1118
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:32,030
you can eat it. It's really good for
you. You smoke it. It gets you high.

1119
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,210
You can compare it well,
yeah, you can wear it.

1120
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:38,640
Make a bass cloth ever live in underneath
it. You can make plywood out of it.

1121
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:41,060
It's fucking waterproof.
It's crazy.

1122
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:46,120
Probably the best Celio of plant
there is you make plastic out of it.

1123
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:48,860
You can make plastic plants,
healthy plastic,

1124
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:53,570
biodegradable plastic and plastic bags
that don't clog up the planet. Yeah.

1125
01:08:53,571 --> 01:08:56,960
People don't realize that plastic can be
made from plant matter can be made from

1126
01:08:56,961 --> 01:08:57,290
hemp.

1127
01:08:57,290 --> 01:09:00,680
One of the reasons why hamp was also
made illegal was that it was at the same

1128
01:09:00,681 --> 01:09:04,280
time we're dupont was coming up with a
chemical compound for nylon for now and

1129
01:09:04,281 --> 01:09:07,810
most ropes up to that date had
been made out of hemp. Hemp isn't,

1130
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:12,260
it was Medable fiber. Hemp is the
best robe. Do, oh, by the way,

1131
01:09:12,261 --> 01:09:16,540
do you sell your ropes or the hemp?
I don't know what the fuck they are is.

1132
01:09:16,541 --> 01:09:17,351
You should check it out.

1133
01:09:17,351 --> 01:09:20,060
Should they shouldn't be hemp or
should be try to get them hemp

1134
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:25,150
ropes from a ship yard. They have the,
you want to grip leather anyway, the,

1135
01:09:25,151 --> 01:09:28,230
the leathers at the end of them
so you can get it. I like that.

1136
01:09:28,410 --> 01:09:31,970
That you like raw fiber. Who wrote
field? It doesn't slip out of your head.

1137
01:09:31,971 --> 01:09:35,090
It's great workout if you'd done it. Oh,
I do it all the time. You do battle ropes.

1138
01:09:35,150 --> 01:09:39,020
Oh, that's awesome man. Look at
that. Yeah. So does my wave Shelby,

1139
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:43,510
Tommy motherfucking Chong torn down
some battle ropes. Oh yeah. Dawn,

1140
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:47,870
big body movements are so, so important
for health and for your, your,

1141
01:09:47,871 --> 01:09:51,620
your body's actual ability to work and
move. Well that was one of the reasons,

1142
01:09:51,621 --> 01:09:56,120
you know, back in the day when Arnold
Schwartzenegger lit up a joint,

1143
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:01,040
you know, I said, this is
all the proof anybody needs.

1144
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:06,350
Here's the guy that's really
the best built man in the world.

1145
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:07,423
In the world.

1146
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:12,640
Seven Times six have been times
that he's getting high and here,

1147
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:16,970
here's a guy that he'd
spit out something if it,

1148
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,150
if he thought it has sugar in it
or something, he would spit it out.

1149
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:22,910
If you took a drinker
or a bite of something,

1150
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:28,340
he's so careful about what he puts in
his body. No alcohol, forget all that.

1151
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:33,180
But a joint passible review,
mine

1152
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:37,490
gets high. He must've figured
that out when he was young.

1153
01:10:37,730 --> 01:10:41,120
I wonder when he figured that out. Well,
everybody figures out the same way.

1154
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:46,320
Everybody asks me,
how did you get turned onto putt?

1155
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,070
No.
What kind of drugs do you take?

1156
01:10:49,071 --> 01:10:51,500
And I say anything given
to me by a naked lady.

1157
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,730
I smoked pot only a handful
of times in my life,

1158
01:10:59,270 --> 01:11:03,470
maybe half a dozen until I was 30.
And then when I was 30,

1159
01:11:03,471 --> 01:11:07,310
a friend of mine got me high and I
had a completely bad perception of the

1160
01:11:07,311 --> 01:11:09,440
effects of marijuana.
I thought it made you lazy.

1161
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:11,970
I thought it was to
something that's sedated you.

1162
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:13,860
I thought it's something
that made you and stupid.

1163
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:15,180
And I wasn't interested in that.

1164
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,650
And even though I had one experience
to the contrary when I was,

1165
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:22,260
I was living with my friend Jimmy d
Teleo and he had a friend that was a big

1166
01:11:22,261 --> 01:11:25,920
pothead and we all decided to uh,
smoke some pot together.

1167
01:11:25,921 --> 01:11:29,430
I can never smoke pot needed the chimney.
So we got high and then I'm like,

1168
01:11:29,431 --> 01:11:32,490
Jesus Christ, man, I've got to drive
to a Gig. It was like two hours later,

1169
01:11:32,491 --> 01:11:36,180
it's still baked out of my fucking head.
And I had never gotten high before,

1170
01:11:36,181 --> 01:11:36,971
like maybe be,

1171
01:11:36,971 --> 01:11:41,790
he had to do maybe two or three other
times in my whole life before then. Right.

1172
01:11:41,791 --> 01:11:43,740
And only usually when I had
a couple of drinks in me,

1173
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:47,850
so I have to drive and do this Gig
and I'm shitting my pants. I'm like,

1174
01:11:47,851 --> 01:11:51,270
I can't do my comedy. Hi. First of all,
the audience is gonna know him high.

1175
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:54,530
I was only 21 or 22.
And um,

1176
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:59,490
I had the best set I've ever had
up to that point. I was like,

1177
01:11:59,491 --> 01:12:04,050
this is crazy. Like I've never been so
smooth. I've never relax. Yeah. Relax.

1178
01:12:04,051 --> 01:12:08,490
Focus on what I'm actually solving
in the moment. Totally in the moment.

1179
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:11,430
I was like, that's incredible. And I
was like, they can't be because of B,

1180
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:15,300
because of the weed. I was so scared to
try it again. I never tried it again.

1181
01:12:15,301 --> 01:12:18,480
But I remember thinking that like, wow,
was it through? And I was like, Dude,

1182
01:12:18,481 --> 01:12:22,770
you just got lucky. Okay. You could have
been you it on stage in an hour earlier.

1183
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:27,570
You would've fucking shit
all over yourself on there.
Cause I was shaky, you know,

1184
01:12:27,571 --> 01:12:31,550
back then I wasn't very good.
Yeah. So Tom, you're young. Yeah.

1185
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:34,860
So I would bomb a lot.
She bomb like one of every five times.

1186
01:12:34,861 --> 01:12:38,580
It would not go well. So I was really
not, not looking forward to this,

1187
01:12:38,581 --> 01:12:40,530
not working out while it was high,

1188
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:43,970
but it was the best bed ever had
up to that point. It was crazy.

1189
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:46,470
Cheech and I,
when we first got together,

1190
01:12:48,730 --> 01:12:53,520
I had an acting group,
topless bar, the dancers,

1191
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:58,470
dancers, you know, had them
acting and actors. Yeah.

1192
01:12:58,530 --> 01:13:01,690
Girls are the girls that would
go naked, you know. And, uh,

1193
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:05,050
I'm thinking of doing one here,
but it's a lot of work. Um,

1194
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:07,800
what's a lot of work dealing
with the topless girls used
to dealing with anybody.

1195
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:13,440
But you do it a podcast
aren't you? I am, yeah.

1196
01:13:13,441 --> 01:13:17,820
I'm starting to in September. That's
awesome. Yeah, I'm going to, in fact,

1197
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:22,670
you can catch me on at Tommy
Chong and Cheech and Chong logo.

1198
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:23,111
Well,

1199
01:13:23,111 --> 01:13:26,800
let us know when that's taking place and
we'll tweet it and pump it up and get

1200
01:13:26,801 --> 01:13:28,780
everybody to listen then.
I think that's awesome.

1201
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:33,770
Yeah. What was I saying? I forgot now
I forgot to, I forgot every guy we go.

1202
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:39,650
Uh, we were talking about, uh,
bodybuilders get smoked marijuana. How?

1203
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:43,100
It's obviously not that for you.
Uh,

1204
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:46,260
basically the company's points
that we're supposed to be.

1205
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:50,430
Did you have this doctor drew shit, man,
Don did you got caught? Uh, they, uh,

1206
01:13:50,431 --> 01:13:55,431
a pharmaceutical company had paid
him to encourage use of a certain

1207
01:13:56,161 --> 01:14:00,780
antidepressants as a, um, out
of a car. Yeah, he got caught.

1208
01:14:00,781 --> 01:14:05,781
They gave him 270 something
thousand dollars and he was correct.

1209
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:12,490
He was supposed to, uh, talk about
the, the talking points of the positive

1210
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:15,930
sexual side effects of
Welbutrin because like, uh,

1211
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:20,410
like a girl would call up and say she
just got to changed her or her pills to

1212
01:14:20,411 --> 01:14:25,411
Welbutrin and now she's get having like
10 orgasms a day and doctor [inaudible]

1213
01:14:25,850 --> 01:14:29,920
like telly that could, that is one of the
possible symptoms. And like he's like,

1214
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:32,910
they, he actually said that
talking, I did get busted.

1215
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:37,720
I guess the company just lost a big
lawsuit. They just lost a, they,

1216
01:14:37,721 --> 01:14:42,640
they got, uh, a 3 billion something
dollar judgment against them.

1217
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:45,180
So in, yeah, in the pro,

1218
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:49,270
in the process of that they had to
release their paperwork and in releasing

1219
01:14:49,271 --> 01:14:49,961
their paperwork,

1220
01:14:49,961 --> 01:14:54,940
apparently Dr drew was a recipient of
more than a quarter million dollars from

1221
01:14:54,941 --> 01:14:59,040
them. It's scary, man. I liked,
I liked Dr. True, man. I,

1222
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:03,010
that guy needs a joint. You know, you,
you get a little crazy, he's uptight.

1223
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:07,420
He's a way uptight and got ticks. You know
what you're noticing. Do you know him?

1224
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:09,670
Yeah. Yeah, I know him.
I like him. I like him.

1225
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:13,930
A lot of done has a radio show a
couple of times. I like them a lot,

1226
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:16,930
but he gets silly and he says to me,
he said to me,

1227
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:21,280
he's having trouble with the next job
for, I said, what? What kind of trouble?

1228
01:15:21,281 --> 01:15:25,450
He said, well, if she's accusing me of
sexual harassment, I just get a lawyer.

1229
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:28,770
Doctor drew.

1230
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:33,690
So then I then teach it over on
the show and Dr Juice says to me,

1231
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:38,220
hey, I took your advice, Tom.
I've got a lawyer, and Cheech
looked at me like, what?

1232
01:15:39,450 --> 01:15:43,540
What's going on here and fill me in. We
never did fill them in. That's funny.

1233
01:15:43,590 --> 01:15:48,520
I hate to hear that, man. It's a bummer.
That's the American way. Well, it's also,

1234
01:15:48,521 --> 01:15:53,050
guess what? Everybody needs
something to put them in check.

1235
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:58,000
If you're not doing yoga and meditating
and taking some time to you so you can

1236
01:15:58,001 --> 01:16:00,310
get caught up in one way or the other,

1237
01:16:00,311 --> 01:16:04,450
the wrong fucking path that somehow or
another you're going to trip up. Well,

1238
01:16:04,451 --> 01:16:08,390
you got caps and clean out there wearing
a fucking tie every day and pretend

1239
01:16:08,391 --> 01:16:10,540
that you do no evil.
That shit. By the way,

1240
01:16:10,541 --> 01:16:13,950
is going to chew at the back
of your brain. You know,
you've committed yourself.

1241
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:18,010
Does this crazy, unreal life where you
know you're not going to get fucked up.

1242
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:22,420
You can't do shots with your friends. You
can't go to a strip, come, go, oh shit.

1243
01:16:22,421 --> 01:16:25,750
You can't do that. You're not. You're not
allowed to. You know, watch my reputation.

1244
01:16:25,751 --> 01:16:30,250
You're different. You're not an honest
human. You're a, you're a creation. Yeah,

1245
01:16:30,290 --> 01:16:32,680
and for me front and he
needs a little fucking,

1246
01:16:32,681 --> 01:16:34,210
everybody needs a little humbling,

1247
01:16:34,211 --> 01:16:36,640
like a natural humbling and it's
what marijuana does too. Well,

1248
01:16:36,641 --> 01:16:38,820
is that going to be a little natural
humble? Is that going to take them off?

1249
01:16:38,821 --> 01:16:42,460
He showed it. I don't know. I mean
hopefully he'll be acquitted. I like him.

1250
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:46,790
I hope he didn't do it. I hope it's
not true. I hope if it is true,

1251
01:16:46,791 --> 01:16:50,830
it was charges. Yeah. I believe. I
believe they're investigating. I don't,

1252
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:53,380
I don't know the full extent of it.
It's just been in the news lately.

1253
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,960
But like I said, I liked
doctor Joe. He's not a bad guy.

1254
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,610
It's just that these people,

1255
01:16:57,611 --> 01:16:59,860
they had this idea that they're
protecting people from something.

1256
01:16:59,861 --> 01:17:03,850
Here's the stance. It's not just, well,
why am I eating? I'm fine with that.

1257
01:17:03,851 --> 01:17:05,800
If you want to smoke pot, that's what
he always says. I'm fine with that.

1258
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:08,410
If you want to get high, go get
high. This is what I'm saying.

1259
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,310
I'm saying it can change

1260
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:14,270
your fucking life and for the better.
It can make you a warmer,

1261
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:15,920
more compassionate person.

1262
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:18,320
It makes you closer to your
friends and your loved ones.

1263
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:22,340
It makes you appreciate your dog more.
It makes food taste better.

1264
01:17:22,341 --> 01:17:25,370
It makes sex feel better.
Like this is ridiculous.

1265
01:17:25,371 --> 01:17:28,790
The idea that you would just poo poo it
and say, well, if you want to go get high,

1266
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:33,260
it's not that man thing that can enhance
you. But you see what he's doing?

1267
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:36,950
He's got one foot on the wall,
one foot on the shore,

1268
01:17:37,370 --> 01:17:41,090
and there's a liquor and he's trying to
be a celebrity. Yeah, there's a liquor,

1269
01:17:41,091 --> 01:17:45,260
there's a liquor. Uh, what do you call it?

1270
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:51,200
Civilization. We're coming out of it.
We're coming out of the, the alcohol.

1271
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:53,740
Civilizing. So you think so
we're coming out of it. Yeah.

1272
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:57,650
You think it's ever possible to get out
of it? It's fun. People like to get drunk.

1273
01:17:57,770 --> 01:17:59,360
The only, they like to do
shots here. Anything else?

1274
01:17:59,361 --> 01:18:04,361
But you look at the movie Ted [inaudible]
and the biggest laugh and the biggest

1275
01:18:04,491 --> 01:18:09,230
thing was window little. A teddy
bear was doing a big bong hit. Yeah.

1276
01:18:09,231 --> 01:18:12,050
Well that, that is one thing
that is most certainly changing.

1277
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:16,550
It's becoming more acceptable. Yeah. I
mean, when you were doing those albums,

1278
01:18:16,551 --> 01:18:19,250
like did you guys get hassled by cops?
Like did it become,

1279
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:22,610
did it ever become a factor in your life?
Come when we got one Hassell,

1280
01:18:22,611 --> 01:18:25,920
we got arrested in Tampa,
Florida. That was where, um,

1281
01:18:26,510 --> 01:18:31,100
Jim Morrison got her breast,
it shown his wiener and well,

1282
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:36,560
Janis Joplin, you got arrested.
There wasn't, she teaches
dad, uh, an a cop. Yeah.

1283
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:40,820
Yeah. And so, uh, we were doing our
show and we just did a regular show,

1284
01:18:40,821 --> 01:18:45,080
but we didn't know there was
a $5,000 performance bond

1285
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:51,320
posted and that the cops were
called in for any reason.

1286
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:54,860
The promoter,
elusive $5,000 bond.

1287
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:59,150
And so at the end of the show we're doing
a bit called the dogs where children

1288
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:03,890
are running around our hands and knees
and Cheech walked over to a cop and he

1289
01:19:03,891 --> 01:19:04,880
picked up his hat.

1290
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:09,710
The cop was facing out to the
audience in case the audience would,

1291
01:19:09,711 --> 01:19:14,480
would a riot or something, I don't
know. And that's all they do.

1292
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:17,000
And, and the cups is there. That's it.

1293
01:19:17,001 --> 01:19:22,001
We're rusting Cheech and Chong and they
arrested us and took us to jail and give

1294
01:19:22,251 --> 01:19:25,400
us a mug shots. Good. Mugshots you
like him? Did you ask him for anything?

1295
01:19:25,401 --> 01:19:28,880
Like tee shirts? I think they're
on the tee shirts now. Yeah,

1296
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:33,560
they're really good mojo shows.
Two guys. But Cheech was funny man.

1297
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:36,350
Cause we're in the cell. First
of all, we're Cheech and Chong.

1298
01:19:36,351 --> 01:19:40,970
We just got up to stage 5,000 people, you
know, going crazy. Next thing you know,

1299
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,400
we're being herded into a
holding cell and it was weird.

1300
01:19:45,401 --> 01:19:49,080
It's like we going to the green room only,
it's a holding cell and,

1301
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:53,420
and there's all the drugs and everybody,
there was one old Chicano guy in there,

1302
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:56,390
you know, and he asked
Cheech in Spanish, you,

1303
01:19:56,510 --> 01:20:00,580
what are you in here for it Cheech, he
didn't want to say you, we're lifting.

1304
01:20:00,590 --> 01:20:03,940
The cop sat with his teeth.
So he said, uh, drugs man,

1305
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:09,870
Chicano Spanish. It goes, oh Tom,
I'm a black guy. Send it to you.

1306
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:15,700
Just tell him a blank gang
here between I was his thing.

1307
01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:19,290
And so then the cop would
come by, you know, big, big,

1308
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:26,250
like a storm trooper kind of cop would
walk by and he didn't give a shit who we

1309
01:20:26,251 --> 01:20:29,910
were.
And then there's an old picture

1310
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:35,370
and then teaching area
we're talking about,

1311
01:20:35,490 --> 01:20:39,060
we're not sitting down because we think
we're going to get out of jail real

1312
01:20:39,061 --> 01:20:39,894
quick.

1313
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:44,370
But then a lot of time went by and
pretty soon I'm not only sitting,

1314
01:20:44,371 --> 01:20:49,371
but I'm looking for a pillow because
I'm tired and there's just all these and

1315
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,760
she's just still standing around.

1316
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:56,000
And then the cop walks over and he says
to teach is you come with me and Gigi

1317
01:20:56,730 --> 01:21:01,020
Goes, Oh, my dad's a
cop. They're tired. Yeah.

1318
01:21:01,021 --> 01:21:05,490
My Dad's was the LAPD. Yeah,
I've been 30 years or 20 years.

1319
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:07,910
It was funny.
I laughed.

1320
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:12,570
They separated us and then in
a few hours later then we win.

1321
01:21:13,230 --> 01:21:16,210
That's what we look like.
Is that a trip?

1322
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:18,270
Look folks who are
listening to us on Itunes,

1323
01:21:18,271 --> 01:21:20,010
we're looking at a video
of Cheech and Chong.

1324
01:21:20,011 --> 01:21:24,950
It looks like from the sixties rice, 1974
74 wow. It's all black and white. Yeah.

1325
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:28,550
Wow. 74 they didn't
have color TV for, yeah.

1326
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,720
You guys actually have
a really good website,

1327
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:34,590
a Cheech and Chong fans.com which
just is updated all the time,

1328
01:21:34,591 --> 01:21:35,750
which I really like and they they,

1329
01:21:35,751 --> 01:21:40,751
they posted this recently on there and
there's a lot of different interviews and

1330
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:45,190
videos on here there. Oh, Cheech
and Chong duck fans. Yeah.

1331
01:21:46,170 --> 01:21:47,580
That's very cool.
It's not cool.

1332
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:49,950
There's not one of the coolest
things about the internet.

1333
01:21:49,951 --> 01:21:53,800
Is it fan created stuff that they make
for you? Does that still blow you away?

1334
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:58,650
Taken over the world, man. We've
literally, you know, starting with Egypt,

1335
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:02,880
Libya, you know the Internet
taking over the world.

1336
01:22:03,330 --> 01:22:07,200
The inner has a fascinating thing,
isn't it? Ah, yeah, look at this. Yeah.

1337
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:10,880
Don't you love like the fan generated
stuff that they make for you?

1338
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:14,460
Like like people that put up websites
like Cheech and Chong fans.com.

1339
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:17,370
Isn't that amazing that you mentioned it.
Got a present here.

1340
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:23,410
These are not a pipe's. Not
a pipes. Pipes. What did,

1341
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:26,730
what does their necklace? They're not
a pipe. You don't pull the string.

1342
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:32,590
Pull the string out.
I thought it was like a type of pipe pipe.

1343
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:36,600
You don't pull the string. You put
the substance in this part here. Okay.

1344
01:22:36,601 --> 01:22:37,910
You don't do that and you don't lie.

1345
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:41,710
Don't lie to me and you don't go and
smoke out of it. Spoke Gutter the same.

1346
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:45,390
You don't do that because it's not a pipe.
It's not applied to the necklace.

1347
01:22:46,410 --> 01:22:50,020
That's awesome. And it's yours, Jill.
I'll bring you on that night man.

1348
01:22:50,130 --> 01:22:52,540
I didn't know what was
going to be an extra,

1349
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:55,320
what animal had to give up his life
so I could have this not a pipe.

1350
01:22:56,760 --> 01:23:01,140
What is that? She's just a piece
of Antler driftwood. I follow.

1351
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:06,070
It's Driftwood, uh, route actually
opt to beach. Oh really? Oh.

1352
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:07,150
So I don't have to feel bad.

1353
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:10,610
That wasn't like a little oh dear
that got shot in the head. Oh No.

1354
01:23:10,611 --> 01:23:14,920
Give me like a Ted Nugent pipe. It might
be a piece of wood from the tsunami.

1355
01:23:14,921 --> 01:23:18,430
I Dunno.
It might could be someone's house.

1356
01:23:18,431 --> 01:23:23,431
It might be shit pieces are probably
some kids toy floating around.

1357
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:27,870
No, it's just a promise
center. Cut up a root.

1358
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:33,550
Awesome man. Thank you very much
for that. Thank you very much man.

1359
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:36,970
When is the Cheech and Chong movie
coming out? And I know you had to like,

1360
01:23:36,971 --> 01:23:40,930
there's an animated movie that it's done.
It's all finished.

1361
01:23:40,931 --> 01:23:44,740
It's in the can and no,
they're just figuring out a um,

1362
01:23:45,670 --> 01:23:48,320
release strategy. It's
an animated movie. Yeah,

1363
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:53,050
they animate it a our old
bits. That's awesome. Wow.

1364
01:23:53,170 --> 01:23:54,250
It seems like such a good idea,

1365
01:23:54,251 --> 01:23:58,360
especially since that you do so much
work like on the Simpsons and things like

1366
01:23:58,361 --> 01:24:02,500
that. It's, it's a natural, I mean,
it's a natural way to go to you.

1367
01:24:02,501 --> 01:24:07,501
He'd imagined Cheech and Chong disc
doing voiceover work no more road.

1368
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:12,610
You do you like doing the road every
now and then or is it just too much?

1369
01:24:13,150 --> 01:24:15,490
It's getting too much.
It's getting too much.

1370
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:17,410
Is that what you've been doing lately?

1371
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:18,940
Is just doing shows was
just once in a while.

1372
01:24:19,070 --> 01:24:22,230
There's to Shelby Shelby
now my wife and I go,

1373
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:25,570
we went to Denver last
month or two months ago.

1374
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:30,820
And before that, Cheech ne and Shelby,
when you guys got back together again,

1375
01:24:30,850 --> 01:24:34,540
that was a pretty big resurgence.
Ooh, big time. Two years. Two years.

1376
01:24:34,630 --> 01:24:37,500
Three years ago. Three years. It's
been going on for years and we,

1377
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:40,810
we made a couple million, you
know, I remember when you, uh,

1378
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:42,340
when you guys announced that
you were going to do that,

1379
01:24:42,370 --> 01:24:45,400
you guys had made up and you've finally
gotten back together. And I was like,

1380
01:24:45,401 --> 01:24:50,260
Holy Shit. We made up before,
before I went to jail, we had,

1381
01:24:50,261 --> 01:24:52,930
we were working on a movie.
Oh really? Oh that's cool.

1382
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:57,310
And then I went to jail and in fact we
kept working on it with Larry Charles.

1383
01:24:57,311 --> 01:25:02,050
But it never a new line pulled out for
people that don't know your story of how

1384
01:25:02,051 --> 01:25:04,060
you got arrested in want of doing.

1385
01:25:04,061 --> 01:25:08,620
Tom is one of the most fucked up stories
that sort of in my eyes, a Pitta Mises.

1386
01:25:08,650 --> 01:25:10,690
The insanity of the Bush administration,

1387
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:16,120
John Ashcroft Guy was insane.
And most people don't know this.

1388
01:25:16,121 --> 01:25:19,480
I mean if you, but if you look
online, John Ashcroft singing,

1389
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:20,560
have you ever seen him sing?

1390
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:26,100
He goes or she's never saw before,

1391
01:25:26,131 --> 01:25:31,010
is completely bat shit. The
titties. The summit. Yeah.

1392
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:31,873
Cement titties.

1393
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:36,550
He made them cover up statutes for the
first time in the history of that great

1394
01:25:36,551 --> 01:25:38,430
building.
And so you went and people wonder why,

1395
01:25:38,431 --> 01:25:41,710
why weren't you afraid of this guy?
Because he's a nutcase.

1396
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:45,960
He was completely bonkers. It wasn't
my company. Somebody, my son being a,

1397
01:25:45,961 --> 01:25:50,230
an album, some dude from a, the
Internet. Whoever you are. Dude,

1398
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:52,690
I just want to thank you.
Thank you so much.

1399
01:25:52,691 --> 01:25:56,350
I totally don't even remember who the
guy was, but he sent me a fucking album.

1400
01:25:56,380 --> 01:26:01,380
It was an album of John Ashcroft and
another guy singing gospel songs and they

1401
01:26:01,811 --> 01:26:04,370
were just one more horrific,

1402
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:07,610
horrifying in the next you just,
the more you listen to them,

1403
01:26:07,611 --> 01:26:12,170
the more you thought of him. Sweaty
and black socks. Fucking little boys,

1404
01:26:12,171 --> 01:26:14,160
you know something going on.

1405
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:16,940
There's a darkness and the
other side of this fucking coin,

1406
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,100
like this is not coming
from a healthy person.

1407
01:26:19,101 --> 01:26:22,880
This is a crazy form of art
you're trying to sell me on. When

1408
01:26:22,890 --> 01:26:24,600
they went to his hospital bed,

1409
01:26:24,601 --> 01:26:29,070
when he was sick or something and
trying to get him to sign, what was it?

1410
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,140
What were they trying to get them to
sign? A confession or something? No,

1411
01:26:31,141 --> 01:26:35,190
I think it was okay. Torture
or something. Ashcroft.

1412
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:39,600
Ashcroft was the attorney general.
He wouldn't do it. He wouldn't do it.

1413
01:26:39,601 --> 01:26:43,660
I'm no sorry. I knew that he
was a crazy man. Oh, he does,

1414
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:48,240
lady that put me away. Mary Beth's
Buchanan. What about, what was her deal?

1415
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:51,370
She was a cheerleader.

1416
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:55,750
A little town in Pennsylvania where
the nine 11 plane went down. Yes.

1417
01:26:56,100 --> 01:27:00,150
And because she was a prosecutor there
that give her prominence and they made

1418
01:27:00,151 --> 01:27:04,980
her, made her the chief of
the prosecution. Oh my God.

1419
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:09,490
Yeah. She was like the chief prosecutor.
Oh. And the first thing she did was when,

1420
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:14,250
after the bomb companies and
Tommy Chong and it, by the way,

1421
01:27:14,251 --> 01:27:17,810
you weren't even telling the bonds, your
some son, he was making them his own.

1422
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,550
Yeah. And you didn't even have
anything to do with it. Well,

1423
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:24,330
I'd sign them east side. I'd sign. That
was your job and they went after you.

1424
01:27:24,390 --> 01:27:25,770
They went after him. Well, what they did,

1425
01:27:25,771 --> 01:27:29,160
they went after the company
and which was very, very funny.

1426
01:27:29,161 --> 01:27:33,990
We got the documentary called Aka Tommy
Chong. I know about it. But uh, yeah,

1427
01:27:33,991 --> 01:27:36,190
they tried to try to,
Dan trapped us,

1428
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:40,320
they tried to get us to send the stuff
to their place and we wouldn't do it.

1429
01:27:40,860 --> 01:27:44,160
Finally sent an undercover
guy into our company. And

1430
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:50,250
next thing you know,
I'm a before for bones while,

1431
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:55,170
but I'd Milt Milt is shit out of it.
It's true.

1432
01:27:55,171 --> 01:27:55,441
Right.

1433
01:27:55,441 --> 01:27:58,830
That really gave you a nice boost once
you got out of the pokey have gave me

1434
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:02,400
while I was still doing material.
Yeah. Still doing well when I was,

1435
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:06,360
and I bring it up in conversations
to, you know, when I was in jail,

1436
01:28:06,370 --> 01:28:09,750
I know sometimes one time
I was with two judges,

1437
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:12,810
two judges at a dinner party and,

1438
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:15,720
and I that we got the dark and
then the next thing you know,

1439
01:28:15,721 --> 01:28:19,800
I'm telling him about jail and they're
kind of giving me the, Oh shit,

1440
01:28:19,801 --> 01:28:23,970
look like they shouldn't be talking to
mission and be listening to this now.

1441
01:28:23,971 --> 01:28:26,730
And then I'll talk to a square
dude about getting high, you know,

1442
01:28:26,731 --> 01:28:30,650
and you see a look in their face but
are looking for the exit. Okay. If

1443
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:35,430
that's what you're into. Oh,
I liked, I'm straight edge.

1444
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:40,460
I like my scotch or water.
I don't mind a little booze in,

1445
01:28:40,461 --> 01:28:45,130
but I don't smoke dope. And these judges
are cool. We're friends with them. Um,

1446
01:28:46,110 --> 01:28:49,470
uh, one's, uh, it's very good
to have a judge for a friend.

1447
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:55,560
You know, I had given you help me. I
got all kinds of friends, you know,

1448
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:59,790
you must put it pretty funny. Yeah,
there's a whole set of different,

1449
01:28:59,791 --> 01:29:02,040
different people that you're
known being an outlaw,

1450
01:29:02,041 --> 01:29:06,840
but it's the silliest law of all time.
I'm kind of like a stoner, Paris Hilton,

1451
01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:13,260
where they looked at me at a party.
Everybody,

1452
01:29:13,261 --> 01:29:17,310
we have Tommy Chong here,
we can all get high. No,

1453
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:18,630
and he's not wearing underwear.

1454
01:29:19,470 --> 01:29:21,660
Is it annoying how many people
want to get high with you?

1455
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:26,550
Well, it keeps me from going into places,
you know, like I'd like to do, you know,

1456
01:29:26,810 --> 01:29:31,570
the playboy mansion pod thing every
year, but I can't do it, man. You know,

1457
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:34,040
he had too many fans. You know, too many
people want to get high with you all.

1458
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:35,810
They wanted to take pictures,
right.

1459
01:29:35,890 --> 01:29:40,010
And telling stories just swarm on you
and be on their podcast. You know,

1460
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:42,470
like that's how you're here,
man.

1461
01:29:45,670 --> 01:29:50,120
This phone be in Tommy. John, do you,
do you smoke pot with strangers? No. No.

1462
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:54,890
Me Neither. No, I don't. If, I don't
know it's, it's too much risk. Sorry.

1463
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:59,090
I tell people I don't,
I quit smoking and I usually don't.

1464
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,910
I have to really know where the source of
the weeders from before I'll accept it.

1465
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,390
Then we'll give it friends of mine,
you know,

1466
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:12,200
tell him this is where I got this shit.
That's exactly what I do. I'm like,

1467
01:30:12,250 --> 01:30:14,210
it's just certain people that
I get I with that I know.

1468
01:30:14,211 --> 01:30:16,250
But I mean it's unfortunate but I've had,

1469
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:19,970
I know one guy that definitely came
up to me that was a cop in uh, in,

1470
01:30:19,971 --> 01:30:23,660
in Cleveland. I'm positive this knew
something was going on. You know,

1471
01:30:23,661 --> 01:30:27,200
he's asking me where I could get
DMT. Oh. And the way he was asked,

1472
01:30:27,201 --> 01:30:29,330
he said we had a crew cut.
I looked like a trend.

1473
01:30:29,730 --> 01:30:32,720
He did MMA and I'm looking at this
dude and I'm like, cause you want what?

1474
01:30:33,290 --> 01:30:36,380
Strange guy that looks like a cop
asked me where to get illegal drugs.

1475
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:37,970
I wouldn't want to talking about,

1476
01:30:38,030 --> 01:30:42,650
I once had two cops worked their
ass off for me. It was funny.

1477
01:30:43,370 --> 01:30:44,870
I had a nightclub in Canada

1478
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:49,220
and then I had to nightclubs in one cut,

1479
01:30:49,221 --> 01:30:52,670
closed down and saw it and they
sold the building. So then I moved,

1480
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,760
I had a back room, you know,
so I was fixing up a back room,

1481
01:30:56,270 --> 01:30:59,120
did take over the other club.
And uh,

1482
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:04,900
next thing I know I got to a
man and a girl with headbands,

1483
01:31:06,090 --> 01:31:10,040
they come up stairs and they're like,
they're not hippies by no means.

1484
01:31:10,041 --> 01:31:13,520
The headbands looked like a costume look
like they're going trick or treating

1485
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:20,060
a, this is how they dress swimming. So
he said, so, so what's going on up here?

1486
01:31:20,410 --> 01:31:23,270
And I said, well, I'm just putting the
club together. He says, I need some help.

1487
01:31:23,930 --> 01:31:28,580
I said, yeah, actually I do. So,
okay, so they're in there helping,

1488
01:31:28,581 --> 01:31:30,380
you know,
what were you thinking at this time?

1489
01:31:30,530 --> 01:31:33,370
I'm looking at them because they thinking,
wow, I could use a help, but who knows,

1490
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:39,260
I'm not going to pay him
anything. You know, maybe let
them in the club later, pre,

1491
01:31:39,261 --> 01:31:39,471
you know,

1492
01:31:39,471 --> 01:31:44,450
so they're moving tables and washing
floors and so weird they show up and start

1493
01:31:44,451 --> 01:31:48,230
working. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And they were
working and good workers too, you know,

1494
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:51,460
the more I look at him and I said,
these are hippies.

1495
01:31:52,780 --> 01:31:57,610
Hippies will hide behind a wall to
see you or they're working. Okay,

1496
01:31:57,620 --> 01:32:02,140
I'm going to here. So, so they worked
and then we had a little break, you know,

1497
01:32:02,141 --> 01:32:03,360
when we're sitting around talking.

1498
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:08,280
So I said then there's brief from
odor from Saskatchewan. Yeah.

1499
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:10,090
I've been here, out here.
Oh, a couple of days.

1500
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:14,620
So, um, so, um, have you ever got high?

1501
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:19,610
Oh yeah. Get high on the fact
as well. Ever done acid said.

1502
01:32:19,780 --> 01:32:23,620
Yeah. Oh yeah. I love acid. Yeah. I just,
well tell me about your first acid trip.

1503
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:25,810
The guy goes,
I don't remember.

1504
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:32,180
He said, I said, just a minute.
I got to go to the bathroom.

1505
01:32:32,181 --> 01:32:35,130
And I went to the bathroom. I
did a little dance there. Carbs,

1506
01:32:35,670 --> 01:32:40,150
carbs through fucking cops. That's
the Lens. I went back. I said, well,

1507
01:32:40,151 --> 01:32:43,930
let's get to work. We got a lot of work
to do here. So you just put them to work.

1508
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:46,600
So he scrubbed the
floor, man, I had a man,

1509
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:52,640
there's Headbanger's
soaking wet with sweat man,

1510
01:32:52,660 --> 01:32:56,410
their work their ass off.
And then I got on the phone,

1511
01:32:56,411 --> 01:32:57,970
I phoned everybody I knew.
You know,

1512
01:32:57,971 --> 01:33:02,971
cause we just say the door lady used
to sell weed right at the door kind of

1513
01:33:04,661 --> 01:33:09,400
club. It was so, so then the club filled
up and they stayed the whole time.

1514
01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:10,880
They didn't go home
and change or anything.

1515
01:33:10,890 --> 01:33:14,980
He got their little headbands or did
they change? No, I think they did change.

1516
01:33:14,981 --> 01:33:18,510
They went home is okay, we'll see
you back later. And then he came,

1517
01:33:18,511 --> 01:33:22,330
sat together and they look like recruits.
They looked like recruits.

1518
01:33:22,331 --> 01:33:24,850
I mean they were so, so, so out of place.

1519
01:33:25,090 --> 01:33:28,320
And I told everybody and so everybody
would walk by and like they were on

1520
01:33:28,330 --> 01:33:29,140
display.

1521
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:32,780
They just walk by and look at the
clubs you're looking at it and walk by.

1522
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:36,790
It was so everybody kept an eye on them.
And if you want to smoke weed,

1523
01:33:36,810 --> 01:33:39,840
just made sure you knew where the cops
were. Yeah, yeah. Well first of all,

1524
01:33:39,841 --> 01:33:43,020
you don't do anything, you know
they're cops. So no one does anything.

1525
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:45,320
So no one did anything.
Hey Claire

1526
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:49,870
and the lady, you know, all of a sudden
it was the cleanest club in, in town.

1527
01:33:51,610 --> 01:33:52,690
So now at the end,

1528
01:33:52,691 --> 01:33:55,820
did you ever let them know that you knew
they were coming to us? Oh No, no, no, no,

1529
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:59,830
no, no. Don't give that. How'd you
end the night? Well, they just left.

1530
01:33:59,890 --> 01:34:03,360
They just left. They couldn't make a
connection and they knew they got spotted,

1531
01:34:03,370 --> 01:34:06,390
you know, you know I'm cool. Cool.

1532
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:09,010
But there's a lot of people
that he never fucking cops, man.

1533
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:13,720
Imagine how paranoid they would
have been if you got them high. All.

1534
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:18,490
Oh my goodness. I had never thought
of that. I kind of glad though,

1535
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:21,730
because I didn't want to get arrested.
You know for, yeah, but what if,

1536
01:34:22,270 --> 01:34:25,270
what if you made them smoke weed at first?
What if you said something like,

1537
01:34:25,271 --> 01:34:28,970
listen man, I don't know
you. So if I don't know you,

1538
01:34:28,971 --> 01:34:31,700
you got to smoke the weed first
and then the guy smoked weed,

1539
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:33,850
like I'll smoke to eat later,
but you got to smoke to eat first.

1540
01:34:34,290 --> 01:34:38,320
You imagine what that would be
like? Get, I'm high as fuck.

1541
01:34:38,380 --> 01:34:39,610
And especially if they don't get high,

1542
01:34:40,210 --> 01:34:43,600
but they didn't test guys blood
and shit back then. Midday. No,

1543
01:34:43,780 --> 01:34:44,613
they didn't know how to,

1544
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:49,120
now they test people work at ups
and then you get a p and a cousin.

1545
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:53,590
I was in jail with a bunch of ups guys.
They got caught.

1546
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,010
They were the Jimmy can connection.
Oh they bringing it over

1547
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:01,040
from black guns,
all black and then all the ups.

1548
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:06,590
Fedex a man. Why has it, why else
would you want to work so hard for gps?

1549
01:35:06,610 --> 01:35:09,980
A whole connection. That's what I'm
saying. You know, that's why, you know,

1550
01:35:09,981 --> 01:35:14,090
just legalize this shit. We can
figure out how to grow it and pack it,

1551
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:16,040
move it. Well, it's,

1552
01:35:16,190 --> 01:35:20,060
we were suppressed and we're
just accepting the fact
that were suppressed. It's,

1553
01:35:20,061 --> 01:35:23,600
it's people they don't realize,
hey, how much of a suppression,

1554
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:25,770
welcome to the slave.
Yeah,

1555
01:35:26,090 --> 01:35:29,690
we're world. The world of
world of color. Yeah, that's,

1556
01:35:29,710 --> 01:35:32,850
that's exactly what pot
really turned everybody into.

1557
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:37,800
We got turned into people of color,
you know, like Mexicans and blacks,

1558
01:35:37,801 --> 01:35:41,010
you know. That's why they called it
marijuana. You know, they never it, oh,

1559
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:43,370
they're smuggling hemp across the border.
Right.

1560
01:35:43,710 --> 01:35:48,210
They named it is a wild Mexican tobacco.
Right? It hasn't, it no mirror marijuana.

1561
01:35:48,220 --> 01:35:49,860
Just slang for a pot.
That's all.

1562
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:54,480
I thought it was originally slang for a
wild Mexican tobacco. Couldn't be. Yeah,

1563
01:35:54,481 --> 01:35:57,930
that's what I thought it was. But that
could be harsh. It to be. But then that,

1564
01:35:57,931 --> 01:36:01,140
that was one the ways William Randolph
Hearst had actually made it illegal.

1565
01:36:01,141 --> 01:36:03,540
It's telling people that
Mexicans and blacks were taking,

1566
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:04,561
you're not making this up,

1567
01:36:04,561 --> 01:36:08,310
but they were actually stories in the
newspaper and the Hearst publications that

1568
01:36:08,311 --> 01:36:10,860
said there's a new drug,
it's called marijuana,

1569
01:36:10,861 --> 01:36:14,070
and these Mexicans and blacks are
taking it and they're fucking,

1570
01:36:14,071 --> 01:36:17,540
all the white women horny for weapon.
They use shit.

1571
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:21,510
They use the same argument
with heroin and cocaine,

1572
01:36:22,170 --> 01:36:27,120
except, uh, the, well, the cocaine and
heroin was also check the Chinese opium.

1573
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:30,150
So they've just,
they've just made a faulty connection.

1574
01:36:30,151 --> 01:36:34,080
But their logic is sound at the bottom
end of it is everybody wants to fuck

1575
01:36:34,081 --> 01:36:35,970
white women.
So they just distributed,

1576
01:36:36,330 --> 01:36:38,730
everybody wanted to fuck white
women to all sorts of shit.

1577
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:41,670
Well the vitamin C makes you want to fuck
white women look or eating oranges and

1578
01:36:41,671 --> 01:36:42,504
fucking these girls.

1579
01:36:42,770 --> 01:36:47,030
My line for years, you know, because
when I was a musician, you know,

1580
01:36:47,031 --> 01:36:51,770
I ended up in a black band, right.
And I played from town road,

1581
01:36:51,790 --> 01:36:53,840
Salisbury.
And I tell people on stage,

1582
01:36:53,841 --> 01:36:55,850
I got so black guy ended
up marrying a white woman.

1583
01:36:59,190 --> 01:37:03,480
Was that where marijuana was
most prominent in the early days?

1584
01:37:03,481 --> 01:37:06,300
Was it in the jazz culture as reaper?

1585
01:37:06,550 --> 01:37:10,680
No habit stick a tee.
How would they get sick and ti,

1586
01:37:11,190 --> 01:37:12,023
how were they getting it?

1587
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:17,130
Oh, Puerto Ricans probably.
I don't know who. Kim Mexico.

1588
01:37:17,170 --> 01:37:21,840
I mean if you're in La, you know, any,
any Chicano on the street corner, right.

1589
01:37:21,930 --> 01:37:26,700
Would sell you anything.
You could get a pound for $10 one or $2,

1590
01:37:26,701 --> 01:37:31,140
you know? Really? Yeah, you could
do it. A lot of it would be Kurt,

1591
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:34,540
you know, but oh yeah, put
some rocks in there. No,

1592
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:39,140
they do everything back in the
day and then, and then the, the,

1593
01:37:39,141 --> 01:37:43,860
the dealers are the guides who would
break it down and we'll a little pinners

1594
01:37:43,910 --> 01:37:47,610
little tiny joints and sell
them for a buck a piece. Wow.

1595
01:37:47,670 --> 01:37:50,910
And they barely got you high.
Right. Just Nice. Just Nice.

1596
01:37:50,911 --> 01:37:53,700
Especially if you're a musician, you
know, you don't want to, you know,

1597
01:37:53,701 --> 01:37:56,010
you don't want to be in
coherent, you know? Yeah. Take a

1598
01:37:56,010 --> 01:38:00,360
couple of hits. Oh, just get
that edge knowing him. Boom.

1599
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:04,410
That's exactly what it is. You can
definitely go too deep though. Yeah.

1600
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:08,340
And isn't it funny,
I've never heard heroin addicts say that.

1601
01:38:09,510 --> 01:38:12,690
I've never heard cocaine.
As you say that heroin addicts,

1602
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:16,120
you ever talked to someone who's in the
middle of heroin? They just love it. Oh,

1603
01:38:16,121 --> 01:38:16,954
you just love it.

1604
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:20,580
It's a weird feeling to think that there's
something that can make you feel so

1605
01:38:20,610 --> 01:38:24,930
good, but it's so bad for you. Well,
what it is, this is my, this is my

1606
01:38:26,790 --> 01:38:31,320
definition of a heroin high.
It's really, you've died.

1607
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:36,900
That's a feeling of death. You've had
it. No, no, but that's my, this is my,

1608
01:38:36,910 --> 01:38:40,960
is what you think of this. This is why
they go back to it all the time, you know,

1609
01:38:41,190 --> 01:38:45,840
because for that few seconds,
because it basically it is,

1610
01:38:45,841 --> 01:38:49,320
if you'd say it gets less than that,
as you get older, you know, as you get,

1611
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:52,710
your body becomes immune to it, then
it becomes a, what do they call it?

1612
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:56,400
Chasing the dragon. Oh yeah, yeah. Well,
you never get it. You never get enough.

1613
01:38:56,430 --> 01:39:00,990
You never get into it that first time.
But the first time that, that Ma warmness,

1614
01:39:00,991 --> 01:39:03,510
it comes over you. It
said, it's such a feeling,

1615
01:39:03,630 --> 01:39:07,710
to me it's the feeling of what
Michael Jackson was looking for.

1616
01:39:07,850 --> 01:39:11,100
He was looking for that feeling, you
know? And that's what heroin addicts want.

1617
01:39:11,110 --> 01:39:14,490
They want that peaceful,
calm, gentle, sweet.

1618
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:18,510
Everything makes sense. You
know, the notes are so big,

1619
01:39:18,511 --> 01:39:22,770
you can just touch him and you know, and
that's what, and when you're making love,

1620
01:39:22,771 --> 01:39:27,390
oh, I mean, there's, there's,
um, would he call it ecstasy?

1621
01:39:28,110 --> 01:39:30,780
After ecstasy?
It just goes on and on and on.

1622
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:35,920
But the second or third time
your body starts, you know,

1623
01:39:36,830 --> 01:39:39,690
create, you need more and
more and more. In other words,

1624
01:39:39,691 --> 01:39:43,440
your body shuts down because it is
a poison. It, it really is a poison.

1625
01:39:44,070 --> 01:39:47,730
And what a weird point. And once you
get into your system and then return,

1626
01:39:47,731 --> 01:39:52,050
it gives you unbelievable feelings of
love as it breaks your body down. Yeah.

1627
01:39:52,110 --> 01:39:55,830
Is it that or is it just
that it stimulates these
unbelievable feelings of love

1628
01:39:55,831 --> 01:39:59,030
and they force your body to do things
that are totally unnatural because of

1629
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,090
these chemicals in the system.

1630
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:04,350
And then the downside is you crash hard
afterwards. What's the downside again,

1631
01:40:04,351 --> 01:40:08,760
to balance out downside? You get sick.
Yeah. He literally, you get sticky cramps,

1632
01:40:08,761 --> 01:40:12,780
you, it's rolled up you,
you get nauseous. You're,

1633
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:15,930
your body's going through
all kinds of changes.

1634
01:40:15,931 --> 01:40:19,170
I had a friend that came to visit me
in La and I didn't know it at the time,

1635
01:40:19,171 --> 01:40:22,920
but when he came here he was trying
to kick it. So as it got to my house,

1636
01:40:22,921 --> 01:40:25,890
he was sick for like a whole week
to do it. Never got out of bed,

1637
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:28,430
just laid around all day.
He had the flu. Yeah.

1638
01:40:28,470 --> 01:40:30,720
Wouldn't tell me what was wrong with them,
but I mean that's what he did.

1639
01:40:30,721 --> 01:40:34,830
That's how he kicked it. Yeah. As soon
as this terrible thing to watch in jail.

1640
01:40:35,490 --> 01:40:40,110
More people oxycontin. Yeah.
Oh, are they filled out?

1641
01:40:40,111 --> 01:40:44,190
The whole jail was built Google.
Yeah. I got goat when I was in jail.

1642
01:40:44,191 --> 01:40:45,970
And so they give you the pure no,

1643
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:50,360
it was some kind of shit
for it and in my mind, God,

1644
01:40:50,430 --> 01:40:55,060
gold got cured real fast. I
had a whole shitload of really,

1645
01:40:55,210 --> 01:40:58,880
and the guy, the guy, the pill
freak across the way. Eagles

1646
01:41:00,770 --> 01:41:05,310
want to sell that. You want to
sell that? You can have a minute.

1647
01:41:05,370 --> 01:41:09,580
Oh Hey. Thank you man. Thank you.
How hard is it to get drugs in jail?

1648
01:41:10,540 --> 01:41:13,910
Well, the trouble with drugs, you
can get anything in jail, but you,

1649
01:41:13,930 --> 01:41:16,890
you get tested if you're a target,
you know, move with me. Right.

1650
01:41:17,230 --> 01:41:21,490
I got offered to join every day.
Really tested almost everyday.

1651
01:41:21,610 --> 01:41:25,000
He thinks that people were trying to
set you up totally. Totally there.

1652
01:41:25,001 --> 01:41:27,700
Then that was her job. Right.
And they got to know what to do.

1653
01:41:27,701 --> 01:41:31,210
Let's fuck with Tommy Chong.
Let's get a headline or do here.

1654
01:41:31,390 --> 01:41:34,630
How bad was was chair? What was
the experience like? It was good.

1655
01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:37,660
Like going to camp was a camp

1656
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:44,110
like boy scouts or army cadets. I was an
army cadet, so it was like going to army.

1657
01:41:44,111 --> 01:41:48,790
Cadet camp was old people, you know,
they had me in an old dormitory,

1658
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:50,960
but it was um,
what do you call it?

1659
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:55,330
Chalk Line around the perimeter and you
couldn't step over that chalk line or

1660
01:41:55,331 --> 01:41:58,120
you get tased,
you get yelled at,

1661
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:03,170
get your ass over there. What
are you doing over there? And um,

1662
01:42:03,730 --> 01:42:06,970
but actually it was, it was like
a spiritual, it turned for me.

1663
01:42:06,970 --> 01:42:11,380
It turned into a spiritual retreat
because I took some books in there,

1664
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:13,150
including the Bible.
And I really,

1665
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:19,000
really started a search for, for,
yeah, I'm here. Might as well,

1666
01:42:19,140 --> 01:42:23,980
it's a monastery, might as well use it.
And so I did. So I did, I read a lot.

1667
01:42:24,370 --> 01:42:28,000
How many, how long were you in jail for?
Nine months. Nine months. Nine months.

1668
01:42:28,001 --> 01:42:32,440
I'll tell you how long,
nine months is those tubes of toothpaste?

1669
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:36,760
The big ones? Three. Three, yeah. Wow.

1670
01:42:37,330 --> 01:42:39,220
That's a long time.
I'll fucking time it doesn't,

1671
01:42:39,620 --> 01:42:42,340
it seems like when it lasts
forever it doesn't. Yeah.

1672
01:42:42,790 --> 01:42:45,390
And what's her three of them?
That's a long fucking time. Yeah.

1673
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:48,220
It's almost a year of life.
Brushing my teeth every day.

1674
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:51,520
It wasn't a brush your teeth to get
something bad out of your mouth.

1675
01:42:51,950 --> 01:42:56,470
[inaudible]
toothpaste.

1676
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:03,770
It's funny, I got hit on one
time. One time. One time.

1677
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,580
Actually I never got,
not in jail,

1678
01:43:07,210 --> 01:43:12,010
but I never got hit on was in
jail. No too. Did you see any rape?

1679
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:17,560
I saw the Barbara was gay. The
Barber, the barber guy. Cut Hair.

1680
01:43:17,590 --> 01:43:22,370
How much did it cost to watch?
Everybody's in, mate. There's no,

1681
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:24,490
no work that the employees are,

1682
01:43:24,491 --> 01:43:29,080
the guards would have to wear their
uniform in the scorching hot sun and like

1683
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:31,360
the river choir, you
know, one of those things.

1684
01:43:31,540 --> 01:43:34,270
And we're laying out there getting
Suntan and the guards are walking around

1685
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:38,630
every once in a while. Could you
bring me some Suntan lotion please?

1686
01:43:38,631 --> 01:43:42,400
And the guard said, what?
Oh, nevermind. Nevermind. I
thought you were someone else.

1687
01:43:44,580 --> 01:43:47,650
Will they nice to you ever?
No, they're real nice.

1688
01:43:48,190 --> 01:43:51,980
They had a law that they had a rule,
a Tommy Chong. No, with Tommy Chong

1689
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:55,510
rule.
And one first day I was there again,

1690
01:43:55,800 --> 01:44:00,260
gardening Gonzales. Next thing you know,
he's in my, in my cubicle. Hey John,

1691
01:44:00,261 --> 01:44:03,500
I'm a big fan. I love you guys.
Ah, I'd go back, blah blah blah.

1692
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:07,400
And so then I was on the
phone the first time I got,

1693
01:44:07,430 --> 01:44:11,630
I wasn't allowed on the phone
for two weeks. And then I
finally got on the phone.

1694
01:44:11,631 --> 01:44:15,700
I get for my wife, you know, and we're
talking, she's how is it? And I said, oh,

1695
01:44:15,710 --> 01:44:20,150
not bad guard came by my cubicle
and it was real nice, you know,

1696
01:44:20,151 --> 01:44:20,984
big fan.

1697
01:44:21,530 --> 01:44:24,950
And so then I hung up the phone and five
minutes later they were listening on

1698
01:44:24,951 --> 01:44:29,840
the phone, just report to
Central Command and control John.

1699
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:34,190
So I go down to the command
control. I said, all right,

1700
01:44:34,191 --> 01:44:37,300
who was the guard that came,
said Hallelujah.

1701
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:42,440
I says, I don't know.
They all look alike to me.

1702
01:44:43,970 --> 01:44:47,430
Was He, was he Mexican? Was never,

1703
01:44:47,530 --> 01:44:51,160
it never really saw his
face or then they do,

1704
01:44:51,190 --> 01:44:55,500
they gave up on me or an hour. Wow.
But yeah, they're looking for snitches.

1705
01:44:56,690 --> 01:44:58,700
Jails are run entirely by snitches.

1706
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,960
They have a snitch culture
really. And what it is. Yeah.

1707
01:45:02,961 --> 01:45:07,910
That's why a lot of guys get a lot
of time, you know, and what they do,

1708
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:11,750
the gels out Kimbark
bargain was the once was.

1709
01:45:11,810 --> 01:45:15,670
A lot of times we'll knock
out the time if you really,

1710
01:45:15,890 --> 01:45:19,430
if you give up people, that's ridiculous.
That seems like that should not be fair.

1711
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:23,510
That's cheating the whole genesis
going of course people in to do things.

1712
01:45:23,570 --> 01:45:26,960
The whole jail systems cheating. Well,
the whole fact that it's private test,

1713
01:45:27,330 --> 01:45:29,330
that's terrifying isn't it? Hid. It is.

1714
01:45:29,590 --> 01:45:33,680
And in the jails are really
run by inmates, you know?

1715
01:45:33,980 --> 01:45:38,960
I mean the guards have some control, but
there, especially at the camps and camps,

1716
01:45:38,990 --> 01:45:41,360
I mean there,
if there's a hint of violence,

1717
01:45:41,361 --> 01:45:45,460
you're out of there and in a vive and look
like you want to be violent, you know,

1718
01:45:45,461 --> 01:45:49,360
they'll, they'll get you out of there
because he had old women guards. You know,

1719
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:51,440
people that you know weren't
going to hurt anybody.

1720
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:56,330
They were the year guards walk around
with her uniforms and stuff on.

1721
01:45:56,810 --> 01:45:58,050
But I,

1722
01:45:58,870 --> 01:46:03,870
I got into the Indian sweat lodge
society and that took up a weekend,

1723
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:05,480
you know,

1724
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:09,590
it starts Saturday and then sweat Saturday
and then have to clean up the place

1725
01:46:09,591 --> 01:46:13,440
Sunday. And you do this while in
jail? Yeah, there was an Indian,

1726
01:46:13,460 --> 01:46:16,630
we had an Indian garb grounds and,

1727
01:46:16,930 --> 01:46:20,930
and it faced away jail at the jail.
And the camp is still do,

1728
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:25,960
it's mandated that the native American
Indians have their form of worship and

1729
01:46:26,211 --> 01:46:29,230
their form of worship is a sweat lodge.
So every jail is what?

1730
01:46:29,310 --> 01:46:34,050
Every federal prison in American.
Wow. They had to go to fascinate.

1731
01:46:34,051 --> 01:46:35,270
You had to go to court to do it.

1732
01:46:35,570 --> 01:46:39,170
And some are better than others
and some are very bare bones.

1733
01:46:39,171 --> 01:46:43,490
But we had a phenomenal place. We
had a, the guy had been in there for,

1734
01:46:43,491 --> 01:46:47,120
I don't know how many years
they took care of the grounds,

1735
01:46:47,330 --> 01:46:50,910
maybe 15 years, something
like, but he, he,

1736
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:55,170
he gathered rocks. There's a
desert, it's a desert. So he got,

1737
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:59,100
he got rocks and he had
little fences made the,

1738
01:46:59,510 --> 01:47:02,910
and then he had a area, therefore
the sweat lodge itself, you know,

1739
01:47:02,911 --> 01:47:06,840
it was all packed earth and
then it was like a tp, you know,

1740
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:10,980
it's a or a Hogan and then they covered,

1741
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:16,590
ours was covered with
plastic and rain stop,

1742
01:47:16,591 --> 01:47:21,540
you know, and then, uh, the sooner
then the big bonfire next to it.

1743
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:25,250
That's what really attracted
me was a bonfire. We had

1744
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:27,210
fire in prison. Right, right. You know,

1745
01:47:27,230 --> 01:47:30,260
it's on her crazy all weekend
and what they would do,

1746
01:47:30,261 --> 01:47:35,060
they leave you every weekend.
I'll be an Indian like that in a minute.

1747
01:47:35,300 --> 01:47:37,190
First of all, it's not an
Indian. How stupid is that?

1748
01:47:37,191 --> 01:47:41,640
We still use the term God damn.
It's the lost whatever.

1749
01:47:41,660 --> 01:47:46,580
They lost Chinese.
One huge mistake from 1492.

1750
01:47:46,581 --> 01:47:50,750
And we're still calling them. And the guy
that did it with such a piece, a shit.

1751
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:56,030
We celebrate the day. Columbus Day. He's
a God damn serial killer. Yeah. Yeah.

1752
01:47:56,031 --> 01:48:00,770
They did horrific things here about what
his soldiers did to the children of the

1753
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:04,680
native Americans. Sure. Dash
and babies' heads on rocks.

1754
01:48:05,590 --> 01:48:10,550
Stories this bloodbath. Yeah.
So, so the native Americans and,

1755
01:48:10,570 --> 01:48:13,610
and there was maybe a house,
I have a one

1756
01:48:14,050 --> 01:48:18,530
in, in our camp, back to
his name. I forgot his name,

1757
01:48:18,740 --> 01:48:23,510
it'll come to me. Anyway. He, uh, he was
head of the thing. He was an old biker.

1758
01:48:23,720 --> 01:48:27,230
X biker had been incarcerated
most of his life.

1759
01:48:27,740 --> 01:48:31,130
And David, I yellow, David Ilm, just,

1760
01:48:31,370 --> 01:48:35,570
he wore a headband and when you
joined the sweat, sweat lodge society,

1761
01:48:35,571 --> 01:48:39,820
you're allowed to wear headbands.
And so, so like a gang, you know,

1762
01:48:40,050 --> 01:48:43,500
the headband came really low
round his eyes and he had,

1763
01:48:43,850 --> 01:48:47,610
he wouldn't talk to anybody and he
worked at, in his Indian grounds period.

1764
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:49,670
They a lot of that.
So all he had to do

1765
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:53,340
that's bad ass. So he wasn't
even really doing time. No.

1766
01:48:53,540 --> 01:48:55,050
Don't know what kind of time

1767
01:48:55,700 --> 01:48:59,270
once you get that, because the Indian
grounds faced away from the prison.

1768
01:48:59,780 --> 01:49:02,570
So it was like you're on the grounds
and you're looking right out into the

1769
01:49:02,571 --> 01:49:05,480
desert and the desert,
who's magical place?

1770
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:08,930
The desert had packs of wild dogs.

1771
01:49:10,370 --> 01:49:12,770
We were close to Bakersfield.
And feel Marlin, you know,

1772
01:49:12,771 --> 01:49:17,771
maybe 1520 miles from Bakersfield and
people would drop up puppies and on one at

1773
01:49:18,950 --> 01:49:20,030
dogs or you know,

1774
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:24,800
just strays and just kick him out into
the desert and the dog's packed up.

1775
01:49:25,790 --> 01:49:30,540
And the leader, the of this one pack
was a big rottweiler. Holy Shit. And,

1776
01:49:30,541 --> 01:49:34,970
and, and they had everything from
little poodles, two big ass rottweilers,

1777
01:49:35,570 --> 01:49:37,100
German shepherds,
all kinds.

1778
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:42,500
It the one dog that vicious looking one.
Anyway,

1779
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:46,220
Hair Doberman. Yeah,
there's a doberman. And,

1780
01:49:46,450 --> 01:49:51,250
and what they would do a shitload on
wild rabbits in Taft and at night they

1781
01:49:51,251 --> 01:49:54,340
would come on the lines like hundreds,

1782
01:49:54,820 --> 01:49:59,820
probably thousands of rabbits
would commode on in feed
and piss around dogs with

1783
01:50:00,251 --> 01:50:03,970
Jack Them. It was the dogs. They
never come and do the camp at all.

1784
01:50:04,060 --> 01:50:07,060
They would never even come close.
But what they would do,

1785
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:11,080
and we've watched it from the
Indian grounds, they would,
there's bramble bushes,

1786
01:50:11,081 --> 01:50:13,600
you know,
clumps of thorny bushes.

1787
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:17,950
And the dogs would chase the
rabbit into the, into the bush.

1788
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:24,250
And then the little poodle would,
would go in and Buddha mode really.

1789
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:28,020
And the big ones would be waiting
at the end. He had a horse track,

1790
01:50:28,300 --> 01:50:32,370
they had a strategy man,
they were so brilliant and,

1791
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:37,600
and we tried and we also had a wild
ground squirrels and you'd feed them by

1792
01:50:39,431 --> 01:50:42,640
hand.
And the groundskeeper was a whole,

1793
01:50:43,270 --> 01:50:45,910
almost as many ground
scores as a were prisoners.

1794
01:50:46,450 --> 01:50:51,450
And we'd walk around this track and take
the food that they tried to feed us and

1795
01:50:52,541 --> 01:50:57,541
Peter to the ground squirrels and the
ground squirrels got fat when one got so

1796
01:50:57,971 --> 01:50:59,710
fat,
couldn't get back down in this hole.

1797
01:51:00,100 --> 01:51:03,610
And to keep the ground
squirrel population down hawks,

1798
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:07,930
they had these beautiful hawks way up
in the light tower and they would sit

1799
01:51:07,931 --> 01:51:11,250
there and watch the ground
squirrels and everyone said wow.

1800
01:51:11,290 --> 01:51:14,890
The ground squirrels would be looking
up and they always had to look out and

1801
01:51:14,891 --> 01:51:16,770
they'd do some kind of
whistle or something.

1802
01:51:16,790 --> 01:51:21,560
If the hawks were coming down then
they'd go into their holes. Wow.

1803
01:51:21,830 --> 01:51:26,210
We fed them until they got
so fat one got so bad. And,

1804
01:51:26,540 --> 01:51:29,100
and the, the, the, I hung up
with all the bikers, you know,

1805
01:51:29,110 --> 01:51:32,480
the old hell's angel types and no bikers.
That's,

1806
01:51:33,220 --> 01:51:36,360
that was my set. Uh, and uh,

1807
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:39,040
we're sitting around and
they would play cards and,

1808
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:43,720
and smoke cigarettes outside,
outside the dorm.

1809
01:51:44,050 --> 01:51:49,050
And one of the bikers was a electrician
and part of his job was keeping all the

1810
01:51:49,961 --> 01:51:54,961
lights working and the lights where
they had the nest was flickering off,

1811
01:51:55,061 --> 01:51:58,510
I guess an ascot tie tied
up with some of the wires.

1812
01:51:58,870 --> 01:52:03,220
And so he had to crawl away up, I know,
40, 50 feet up to the light tower.

1813
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:07,540
And he got up there and he
says, he found, he found, uh,

1814
01:52:08,440 --> 01:52:12,790
what we call it. I forget the ground,
the fact ground squirrel patty,

1815
01:52:13,240 --> 01:52:17,310
they found him dead up there.
He couldn't get an Sol soul.

1816
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:21,820
And when I got Americanized, yeah, one
of the bikers, what are the bikers,

1817
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:24,860
you heard the story and he
looked at the tower and he goes,

1818
01:52:25,390 --> 01:52:28,810
ain't no way in hell that ground
squirrel crawled all the way up there.

1819
01:52:32,630 --> 01:52:33,463
Oh,

1820
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:37,670
he was serious. Oh my God. Oh Man.

1821
01:52:38,340 --> 01:52:43,220
Put on this earth to dig holes.
There were some comedy and in prison,

1822
01:52:43,310 --> 01:52:46,620
I mean that was just one of them. Are
you friends? Anybody from jail? Alright,

1823
01:52:46,790 --> 01:52:51,280
everybody. Yeah. Everybody you just
want to touch. One guy is, um, he's uh,

1824
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:55,130
uh, caddy for, um, uh,

1825
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:58,700
Jeff Overton is a professional golfer.

1826
01:52:59,210 --> 01:53:04,000
He's watched TV and watch everyone
saw you see Jeff Overton and, uh,

1827
01:53:04,070 --> 01:53:07,160
Eric Larson was my,
he was the guy,

1828
01:53:07,370 --> 01:53:10,040
one of the first guys I met
when I went there. He was,

1829
01:53:10,070 --> 01:53:14,060
he was doing time for cocaine.
And what happened?

1830
01:53:14,061 --> 01:53:18,290
He was just a caddy and he was just
buying, but the dealer got busted.

1831
01:53:18,860 --> 01:53:23,060
And so the dealer, the cops
told the dealer, give us a
name and we'll let you go.

1832
01:53:23,990 --> 01:53:24,750
And so she,

1833
01:53:24,750 --> 01:53:29,750
the only name she knew it was Eric Larson
because he was mark Calca Becky's a

1834
01:53:31,100 --> 01:53:34,700
caddy at the time.
And he was the only famous one.

1835
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:39,720
And so Eric fought it, you know, because
he was just a buyer. He wasn't a dealer,

1836
01:53:39,740 --> 01:53:43,640
wasn't right distributing and
nothing. Right. And so they told him,

1837
01:53:43,730 --> 01:53:48,630
if you fight it, you go
with 14 years. And he,

1838
01:53:48,650 --> 01:53:51,530
he won the first case.
Oh my God.

1839
01:53:51,531 --> 01:53:56,531
They refiled the charges slides the next
day they refiled to charge them with

1840
01:53:57,351 --> 01:54:00,980
something else because the feds
are their creative muscles there.

1841
01:54:00,981 --> 01:54:03,680
They want to get it. Dave wanted to
get it done, they want to get you,

1842
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:06,500
they get you. And that's the
way the whole drug culture is.

1843
01:54:06,530 --> 01:54:07,610
That's jail is falling Pharma.

1844
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:12,760
And so he ended up doing fortunate 14
years and his only crime was buying a

1845
01:54:13,401 --> 01:54:17,990
couple of bags of coke for, for
other golfers. So sad. But anyway,

1846
01:54:17,991 --> 01:54:21,050
I met him and he was at the
time he was brilliant guy.

1847
01:54:21,050 --> 01:54:25,940
He's got two college degrees when using
in prison. He was in there for 12 years.

1848
01:54:26,180 --> 01:54:29,060
It's so fucking sad.
He went to school and any,

1849
01:54:29,061 --> 01:54:33,020
and he took advantage of it and learn
how to grow grass and he had a garden.

1850
01:54:33,260 --> 01:54:35,600
He grew his own garden
and then he ended up,

1851
01:54:35,870 --> 01:54:40,220
he tried to get me to work out there
with him, but my time was too short. And,

1852
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:42,710
but I ended up going out to
the garden all the time anyway.

1853
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:46,730
And he would cook for us
at night in a microwave.

1854
01:54:47,030 --> 01:54:50,120
And I had the best meals,
I swear to God. Yeah.

1855
01:54:50,450 --> 01:54:55,100
All fresh garden growing
vegetables. No Shit. It was great.

1856
01:54:55,220 --> 01:54:58,670
It was great. And every once in a
while we'd take her fucking years, man,

1857
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:02,360
whoever did that as evil,
that they belong in jail,

1858
01:55:03,700 --> 01:55:08,030
that was a part of that. They belong,
they belong. I held it should be removed.

1859
01:55:08,060 --> 01:55:12,230
I helped dairy goat because when I met
him, he was a very bitter, yeah, you can,

1860
01:55:12,410 --> 01:55:15,980
as you can imagine,
because he not only went to jail,

1861
01:55:15,981 --> 01:55:20,540
but he went to the toughest
prisons out there and he did his,

1862
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:25,550
he did rough time for about five
years, the roughest time ever. And uh,

1863
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:29,570
and when I met him, you know, he was
very bitter. And so I started constantly,

1864
01:55:29,571 --> 01:55:32,700
I'm a little bit, you know, tell
him, you know, hey, you know,

1865
01:55:32,701 --> 01:55:35,330
you can't let prison each whip.

1866
01:55:35,410 --> 01:55:38,240
Like it's just amazing that someone
could do something like that to him for

1867
01:55:38,241 --> 01:55:41,900
nothing. For a personal
choice issue. The dealer,

1868
01:55:41,901 --> 01:55:44,000
the dealer could have saved his and said,
you

1869
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:48,770
know, why did she turn him in? Just a
piece of shit. Yeah, exactly. She just,

1870
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:52,960
she see I, you know, bite the
bullet and take your time.
She should run away. But I,

1871
01:55:52,980 --> 01:55:57,980
I potentially got Eric and then I
made friends with the drug counselor.

1872
01:55:58,470 --> 01:56:02,280
Oh really? And so yeah, big friends.
I remember when you got out man,

1873
01:56:02,281 --> 01:56:06,030
I was listening to this interview and
it made me sad because they were testing

1874
01:56:06,031 --> 01:56:08,310
you and you couldn't get
high so you would like, uh,

1875
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:11,910
he put yourself in the state of mind
and you can actually even like give

1876
01:56:11,911 --> 01:56:13,220
yourself the munchies you were saying,

1877
01:56:13,420 --> 01:56:16,120
Oh yeah, yeah. It's all mental. You can,

1878
01:56:16,121 --> 01:56:18,860
you can re reenact that feeling anytime.

1879
01:56:19,270 --> 01:56:23,740
That's why Cheech and Chong
are so important to a lot
of our people that because

1880
01:56:23,741 --> 01:56:28,620
you just mentioned her name and all of
a sudden everybody flashes back to, hi.

1881
01:56:29,310 --> 01:56:30,510
Hi Lou Rosa.

1882
01:56:30,710 --> 01:56:32,110
You got a whole audience.

1883
01:56:32,250 --> 01:56:37,030
There wasn't that many people from that
era that were defined by marijuana like

1884
01:56:37,031 --> 01:56:40,390
you guys were. I mean you
guys are the deaf, definitive,

1885
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:43,420
like I know people that would say
let's go Cheech and Chong it. Yeah,

1886
01:56:43,480 --> 01:56:46,450
that's what they say. Yeah. Like you
know when they want to go get high,

1887
01:56:46,451 --> 01:56:49,420
they'd say let's go Cheech and Chong and
everybody knew exactly what they were

1888
01:56:49,421 --> 01:56:50,254
talking.
So

1889
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:55,540
yeah, there was no compromise. We
weren't guys, Hey, let's get him high.

1890
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:59,540
You know he will do some funny shit,
you know? No, that's what I want.

1891
01:56:59,550 --> 01:57:03,420
When I wrote down,
when she said I wrote the up in smoke,

1892
01:57:04,530 --> 01:57:08,490
that's exactly what I had mine.
In fact, every movie I did,

1893
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:13,500
I said I'm not going to waste a bit of
screen time on anything unless it has to

1894
01:57:15,601 --> 01:57:16,650
do with with part.

1895
01:57:17,010 --> 01:57:22,010
And then we got offered a Corsican
brothers and teach at that time.

1896
01:57:23,101 --> 01:57:26,480
She was ready to split, he was
ready to leave and chief says, well,

1897
01:57:26,481 --> 01:57:30,480
I don't want to do another pot
Moby, you know, so I said, well,

1898
01:57:30,481 --> 01:57:34,710
why don't we just make this
one a new one part movie? Okay.

1899
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:39,540
So we did no part in it at all. And
it's a lot of people's favorite movies,

1900
01:57:39,541 --> 01:57:40,970
you know?
But we,

1901
01:57:41,180 --> 01:57:45,330
we reached a point where just being
Cheech and John was all we needed to be.

1902
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:46,670
Right. You know, we didn't,

1903
01:57:46,860 --> 01:57:50,480
we didn't have to smoke a joint or
anything and that's the way it is. Yeah.

1904
01:57:50,590 --> 01:57:54,420
That's the way it is now.
Like when I get introduced,

1905
01:57:54,510 --> 01:57:58,740
it's like a title, you know, this
is Tommy Chong of Cheech and Chong.

1906
01:57:59,130 --> 01:58:01,920
Do you still ever run into
people that don't want to,

1907
01:58:01,921 --> 01:58:05,130
like especially professional people that
don't want to be associated with pot?

1908
01:58:06,720 --> 01:58:11,640
Uh, actors, uh, slow.
Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1909
01:58:11,720 --> 01:58:15,320
There's a shitload of pimp. Depends on
which way the wind's blowing, you know?

1910
01:58:15,890 --> 01:58:20,810
But with me, Oh yeah, there's, there's,
oh, listen to Saturday night live.

1911
01:58:20,811 --> 01:58:23,810
Ever wonder why Cheech and Chong,
I'd never hosted Saturday night live.

1912
01:58:23,990 --> 01:58:28,430
Was that boring? Michael? Does not like
Cheech and Chong. Really? Why does he not?

1913
01:58:28,460 --> 01:58:30,140
Does he conservative?

1914
01:58:30,141 --> 01:58:35,141
We came up when Ackroyd and Belushi and
Belushi marry together and Ackroyd and

1915
01:58:37,581 --> 01:58:42,280
Belushi caused, it caused him so much
grief, but he couldn't fire because

1916
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:46,650
they were, they were the
stars. Right. And, but he, he,

1917
01:58:46,660 --> 01:58:50,920
he never had control of those guys.
And Belushi was a big Chong,

1918
01:58:50,950 --> 01:58:54,850
Cheech and Chong Fan. Big Time.
And I guess Akroyd was too,

1919
01:58:55,330 --> 01:59:00,100
but Belushi was, he was, he was
like a fan. Right, right. Great.

1920
01:59:00,101 --> 01:59:03,820
From the get go. He did, he started, in
fact, he was with second city and he kept,

1921
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:07,780
they were trying to do an album because
teaching chunk done at home. Right.

1922
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:12,840
And bluejay and the producing kept
saying this to Cheech and Chong to,

1923
01:59:12,911 --> 01:59:16,800
Geez, that's funny. Yeah.

1924
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:21,280
They recently had a parody of you guys
on Saturday night did this lab and that

1925
01:59:21,281 --> 01:59:25,340
kind of Kent County got me because why
didn't they have us? Right. I mean we,

1926
01:59:25,341 --> 01:59:30,080
we were available. What was the party?
Can you play it? Uh, what's his name? Um,

1927
01:59:30,130 --> 01:59:34,090
is this it Brian? Yeah, I think it. What's
a, what's the code? The quarterback.

1928
01:59:34,091 --> 01:59:38,430
The one last year. Uh, brother, I dunno.

1929
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:42,250
Manny, one of the
Manning's. Peyton manning?

1930
01:59:42,360 --> 01:59:44,970
No, for their irreverence.
Pop drug healer.

1931
01:59:45,120 --> 01:59:49,020
The past start in several feature films
throughout the 1970s but did you know

1932
01:59:49,021 --> 01:59:52,770
that Cheech and Chong and actually
had a third member? It's true tonight.

1933
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:57,120
We show you that original cuts of
their films with the original lineup.

1934
01:59:57,300 --> 02:00:00,660
Let's take a look at 1978 up in smoke.

1935
02:00:06,150 --> 02:00:10,470
You want to get to the concert?
Even if we got speed. Speed.

1936
02:00:11,350 --> 02:00:14,270
Did you guys see Donny and
Marie last night? It was, Ooh,

1937
02:00:15,070 --> 02:00:19,670
I didn't to speak with me.
I may speak for that speed

1938
02:00:22,120 --> 02:00:25,300
like cousin back home in a lot more.
That runs on Maui wowie

1939
02:00:27,620 --> 02:00:30,580
story.
Sometimes I can't even tell if you teach.

1940
02:00:33,310 --> 02:00:38,290
Hey, did I tell you guys
who's in town? Greg Taylor.
Remember I told you about him?

1941
02:00:38,410 --> 02:00:39,910
He and I went to camp together

1942
02:00:41,470 --> 02:00:46,030
and then just get those days pass.
No thanks.

1943
02:00:49,870 --> 02:00:54,070
No, I better not friends. I have a
scholarship to Indiana University.

1944
02:00:54,310 --> 02:00:57,750
I could not be around drugs.
Would you mind pulling over? Yeah,

1945
02:00:57,751 --> 02:01:00,830
sure thing right up here is great.
Thanks.

1946
02:01:01,480 --> 02:01:03,620
You return then go by Richard.

1947
02:01:05,550 --> 02:01:09,310
Millions of that was funny.
Yeah.

1948
02:01:09,311 --> 02:01:13,030
Why did they use teaching chart? Yeah.
Well they can use it for something else,

1949
02:01:13,031 --> 02:01:16,410
but you wouldn't work for that because
they would have to go back in time. Yeah,

1950
02:01:16,510 --> 02:01:18,230
no, that's true. But I mean,

1951
02:01:18,460 --> 02:01:23,230
I think just out of
respect for the culture,

1952
02:01:23,231 --> 02:01:27,640
you know, they should have had us on
there once. Never went. That's ridiculous.

1953
02:01:28,230 --> 02:01:31,760
How dare he, I mean they'll know is a
Britney spears, it'll have all these,

1954
02:01:31,890 --> 02:01:34,870
you know, Peyton manning
or whatever. In my opinion,

1955
02:01:34,871 --> 02:01:38,080
that show is always to missed
two for me to give it enough.

1956
02:01:38,230 --> 02:01:41,150
There's some hits for sure. Yeah. But
it's so, you know, it's hit and miss,

1957
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:45,020
but so much mass that I'm not willing to
invest any time into it. Yeah, it's hard.

1958
02:01:45,200 --> 02:01:49,480
It's the hardest form of entertainment
to do a live sort of a sketch comedy show

1959
02:01:49,790 --> 02:01:50,623
once a week.

1960
02:01:51,080 --> 02:01:54,380
It's such a crapshoot as to whether or
not things are going to actually be funny.

1961
02:01:54,500 --> 02:01:57,140
Well, they've got no time. They've
got no time to make it funny. Yeah.

1962
02:01:57,230 --> 02:02:00,530
So I got an idea. We don't
have time. Yeah. Yeah.

1963
02:02:00,590 --> 02:02:03,680
They have to hustle through things and
some things get passed. You're like,

1964
02:02:04,070 --> 02:02:05,510
fuck that.
I'm thinking what's going on there.

1965
02:02:05,511 --> 02:02:07,710
But that's what kind of bothered me.
You know,

1966
02:02:07,850 --> 02:02:11,930
when we started doing
concerts lately, um, some,

1967
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:13,250
some of the concerts when I started,

1968
02:02:13,430 --> 02:02:18,430
when I got Kinda got back into the
music a hot second and it was called the

1969
02:02:18,761 --> 02:02:23,690
music speed, you know, rock is all about,
okay, you guys, you've got 15 minutes,

1970
02:02:24,180 --> 02:02:28,730
get on, let's go. This, it got it. Some
backstage goof, you know, telling you,

1971
02:02:29,330 --> 02:02:31,820
oh yeah, hurry up, hurry up, hurry
up. We got to, what, why were you,

1972
02:02:31,910 --> 02:02:34,280
why would they telling you
when to do it? Or like, well,

1973
02:02:34,281 --> 02:02:37,670
it shows me you had other people
with you, the, you know, yeah.

1974
02:02:37,700 --> 02:02:39,980
Either acts going on.
Oh,

1975
02:02:39,990 --> 02:02:43,700
so they're trying to get everybody
on it and then certain certain acts,

1976
02:02:43,701 --> 02:02:47,920
if there's stars during their trailer,
they're not coming out. Right. But,

1977
02:02:48,030 --> 02:02:52,610
but any act they can bullet, you know,
then you would, I just didn't see,

1978
02:02:52,611 --> 02:02:56,330
there's like music festivals. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. This is a few years ago,

1979
02:02:56,930 --> 02:03:00,200
I got both my sons,
one's a bass player,

1980
02:03:00,201 --> 02:03:04,460
wins a drummer and I put a little
thing together, you know, movies,

1981
02:03:04,480 --> 02:03:05,570
their music bit together.

1982
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:10,160
There's just the three of us and it
was good for one summer, you know,

1983
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:14,200
a lot of fun. But the music,
you know, it's, it's uh,

1984
02:03:14,600 --> 02:03:18,920
you know, we, we one thing about
comedy, you know, we, we command,

1985
02:03:19,820 --> 02:03:23,790
you know, we're out there. It's our stage,
you know, I don't like to share on stage.

1986
02:03:24,890 --> 02:03:27,830
Well, it's hard when you have a vision
of what you want to accomplish and then

1987
02:03:27,831 --> 02:03:30,290
somebody else does and then
do the key to being in a band,

1988
02:03:30,291 --> 02:03:34,670
I guess is figure out how to compromise
and making as many people happy as

1989
02:03:34,671 --> 02:03:38,510
possible while still getting out some
fragment or portion of your creative

1990
02:03:38,511 --> 02:03:41,690
vision. But it's certainly much easier to
get out of your full creative vision by

1991
02:03:41,691 --> 02:03:46,670
herself. But I love it. I love it. You
know, I thought about it, you know, now,

1992
02:03:46,671 --> 02:03:49,740
especially now, cause I
got Cheech, no, you know,

1993
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:54,530
we finished our touring in that and so
I was playing around with the idea of,

1994
02:03:54,531 --> 02:03:58,160
you know, putting a band together.
I think about it a hassle.

1995
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:02,960
In fact, I'd rather just drop
down, you know, I like to,

1996
02:04:03,110 --> 02:04:07,520
when you know Shelby and over there
alone or being alone, you know,

1997
02:04:08,180 --> 02:04:12,740
I don't mind that at all. They're
like, yeah, it's, it's a lot easier to,

1998
02:04:12,780 --> 02:04:16,340
to do whatever you want to do.
I'm going to answer to anybody mind trips.

1999
02:04:16,670 --> 02:04:17,930
That's what you're doing with people.

2000
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:22,580
Like I put the sweat lodge in the
show and the first time I did it,

2001
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:26,750
this club owner came running backstage
and screaming at my wife, you know,

2002
02:04:26,990 --> 02:04:29,360
what's he doing?
What's he doing?

2003
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:32,840
He's been talking about
rocks for 15 minutes.

2004
02:04:33,700 --> 02:04:38,040
The club owner was yelling at your
wife. Where was this? This is Craig.

2005
02:04:38,330 --> 02:04:43,140
Uh, Kansas City. Oh, that
crazy. Fuck yeah. Beetle juice.

2006
02:04:44,910 --> 02:04:48,510
Yeah. You're doing it as a real
character math. What's he doing up there?

2007
02:04:48,511 --> 02:04:52,310
He's talking about
rocks. Yeah. Great. Okay.

2008
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:54,120
Sounds it does sound like beetle juice,
doesn't it?

2009
02:04:55,200 --> 02:04:59,550
Well that's the kind of club to dates I
did when I was in the Denver man when I

2010
02:04:59,551 --> 02:05:04,410
was in Denver. I don't know. I don't even
remember smoking. I don't think I did.

2011
02:05:05,250 --> 02:05:10,250
I did five shows and not
one was like the other.

2012
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:15,150
I did five totally different shows.

2013
02:05:15,240 --> 02:05:20,100
How come I just couldn't do it. You just
kind of got the audience going. Yeah.

2014
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:25,140
Denver as a Stoney town. Once
I got them going, I just never,

2015
02:05:25,410 --> 02:05:29,190
never got back onto the script.
Right. And then when my wife and I,

2016
02:05:29,250 --> 02:05:32,730
which we do a set bit,
when we hit the set bit,

2017
02:05:32,731 --> 02:05:37,240
we literally got standing ovations.
Really? Yeah. Wow. How was,

2018
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:43,020
I was so great as tiny. And then we
sold merchants and met everybody.

2019
02:05:43,021 --> 02:05:44,600
It was like old age.
Wow.

2020
02:05:44,660 --> 02:05:48,350
Cause it was a time when we used to
bring a case of bongs but their shit on

2021
02:05:48,370 --> 02:05:52,920
selling. So what I did, I
sold these uh, not a pipes.

2022
02:05:53,620 --> 02:05:58,500
Those things. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The
necklaces. I had grabbed a bunch.

2023
02:05:59,100 --> 02:06:01,530
I don't know, something told
me. Yeah. Take it. You know,

2024
02:06:01,531 --> 02:06:04,890
because we're going up with Cheech
is, was funding everything, you know,

2025
02:06:04,891 --> 02:06:07,880
but confined,
it's Cheech and Chong.

2026
02:06:07,990 --> 02:06:12,300
Do you find it that there's certain
spots in the country where you're more a

2027
02:06:12,310 --> 02:06:17,020
welcomed or the connected you or
they're there the more into pot humor?

2028
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:19,880
Yeah. Well Denver for sure.
For sure. Right. Amber,

2029
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:24,670
Denver isn't marijuana decriminalize? Yep.
In the city. And then they have their,

2030
02:06:24,940 --> 02:06:28,860
they have a medical marijuana, so they
have dispensary's. There's some, I think,

2031
02:06:29,020 --> 02:06:30,880
I don't know if they call it
[inaudible] or damn or what,

2032
02:06:30,881 --> 02:06:31,714
but there's a whole street,

2033
02:06:31,780 --> 02:06:36,290
they even got a system of, um, uh,

2034
02:06:37,960 --> 02:06:42,820
what do you call it?
Naming the clubs. You know,

2035
02:06:42,821 --> 02:06:46,750
like this is a, B and c I
guess. Oh, you mean like,

2036
02:06:46,750 --> 02:06:51,450
like rating the rating them? Yeah.
Really. Like the town has the rating.

2037
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:54,540
Dispensary. Yeah. Yeah, man.
There it's very accepted there.

2038
02:06:54,541 --> 02:06:57,450
It's a fucking great town.
I love Colorado, man.

2039
02:06:57,451 --> 02:07:01,770
I'm not going back there August 10th.
I think I've got a show in Denver,

2040
02:07:01,780 --> 02:07:04,740
whatever that Friday is. Uh, I
can't wait to get back there. This,

2041
02:07:04,741 --> 02:07:07,730
I think there's something, it's
my opinion. But when you're,

2042
02:07:07,830 --> 02:07:11,310
when you grow up in a place
like Denver where it's a city,

2043
02:07:11,490 --> 02:07:16,490
but it's also in face of some of
the most staggering mother nature.

2044
02:07:17,950 --> 02:07:20,760
Not like when you look at those
mountains, the rocky mountains, sorry,

2045
02:07:20,761 --> 02:07:22,830
mother fucker.
And if you're in Denver,

2046
02:07:22,831 --> 02:07:24,870
like I remember we were at a
radio station wants, we were just,

2047
02:07:25,020 --> 02:07:28,440
it was like high a up in this office
building and we're sitting there on the

2048
02:07:28,441 --> 02:07:29,850
20th floor or whatever the fuck it was.

2049
02:07:29,851 --> 02:07:32,910
Looking out there and you see the
rocky mountains like God damn son.

2050
02:07:33,060 --> 02:07:36,160
Well did you ever get tired of looking
at that? That's the goddamn rocky

2051
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:40,720
mountains I grew up in Calgary,
so both the rocky mountain,

2052
02:07:40,750 --> 02:07:42,610
I think when you see
mountains and shit like that,

2053
02:07:42,611 --> 02:07:47,260
I think it puts you in a more
mellow sort of a, a place humbling.

2054
02:07:47,630 --> 02:07:50,350
Yeah, it puts you in proportion.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2055
02:07:50,680 --> 02:07:53,580
The ocean goes the same
thing. Yeah, the desert. Yeah.

2056
02:07:54,130 --> 02:07:57,220
I don't know if that does it as much as
makes you want to fuck people to death

2057
02:07:57,260 --> 02:07:59,230
and brought them up and
leave them in a hole.

2058
02:07:59,260 --> 02:08:03,970
All the wars are being fought in the
desert. So it sucks there. You know,

2059
02:08:03,971 --> 02:08:07,600
I watched this thing and the Taliban, when
the Taliban shot some woman, you know,

2060
02:08:07,601 --> 02:08:11,930
cause they accused her of adultery and
all I could think of is this, this,

2061
02:08:11,960 --> 02:08:16,150
this whole situation sucks where
they live, sucks. The weather sucks.

2062
02:08:16,360 --> 02:08:19,090
The culture sucks to soul
situation. Sucks. Mine.

2063
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:21,880
This would not happen if
it was Brazil and Brazil.

2064
02:08:21,880 --> 02:08:23,650
You know that you don't
accuse a woman of adultery.

2065
02:08:23,651 --> 02:08:25,450
You just deal with it and move on.
Bitch.

2066
02:08:25,451 --> 02:08:28,540
Cause it what girls are hot as fuck and
they're everywhere. It's get over it.

2067
02:08:29,020 --> 02:08:31,930
But in Afghanistan it's
such a fucking struggle.

2068
02:08:32,410 --> 02:08:34,300
Well it's because of the inbreeding.

2069
02:08:34,301 --> 02:08:38,160
I think maybe it's also because that's
where the oldest culture comes from. Yeah.

2070
02:08:38,870 --> 02:08:41,560
I mean it's a bit like the townies
of the world is what it's like.

2071
02:08:41,790 --> 02:08:45,640
You have everything started there.
Mesopotamia, Babylon, Iraq who mayor.

2072
02:08:45,641 --> 02:08:47,500
That's what they think.
They think that everything started there.

2073
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:51,730
If that's where the beaten. Yeah. Well if
that was real, right, whatever that is.

2074
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:55,120
The analogy of that is,
but that from that is where they wrote,

2075
02:08:55,121 --> 02:08:58,270
it has where the those,
where the stories came stories.

2076
02:08:58,810 --> 02:09:01,870
They also had stories that supposedly to
come from even earlier that there were

2077
02:09:01,871 --> 02:09:04,180
like retold. So you know, but,

2078
02:09:04,300 --> 02:09:07,780
but my point is like that's
the spot where it all began.

2079
02:09:07,810 --> 02:09:10,570
Everybody agrees to that.
So if that's a spot where it all began,

2080
02:09:10,740 --> 02:09:14,740
but it's still there. We're
writing, we're mathematics,

2081
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:18,870
agriculture writing. I mean that's, that's
how we got the great buildings in her.

2082
02:09:19,520 --> 02:09:22,630
It was all thanks to
the Arabs. Yeah, sure.

2083
02:09:23,020 --> 02:09:25,870
Persian Algebra or Algebra.

2084
02:09:26,590 --> 02:09:28,390
Now the Arabs and the Muslims in general,

2085
02:09:28,391 --> 02:09:31,440
I mean came up with some amazing
discoveries. It's just, it's,

2086
02:09:31,480 --> 02:09:35,470
what's going on now is this
radical offshoot of it, you know,

2087
02:09:35,471 --> 02:09:37,710
that seems to have been accepted and they,

2088
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:41,860
they backed everybody in the corner where
if you accept Islam at all, you know,

2089
02:09:41,861 --> 02:09:44,160
you have to be on the side of
these radical motherfuckers. Like,

2090
02:09:44,161 --> 02:09:46,030
cause this is like there's this,

2091
02:09:46,090 --> 02:09:49,210
there's this connection in a lot of
people's minds to that, you know,

2092
02:09:49,211 --> 02:09:52,120
that we don't even see Muslims.
We just see radical Muslims.

2093
02:09:52,121 --> 02:09:55,930
It's all anybody sees and like this is
a religion that will not stop until this

2094
02:09:55,931 --> 02:09:56,764
happens and it just,

2095
02:09:57,010 --> 02:10:02,010
it becomes this weird form of
brainwashing on our part and almost like

2096
02:10:03,581 --> 02:10:05,530
reinforcing reality on their part.

2097
02:10:05,531 --> 02:10:08,770
The more we talk about them willing to
blow themselves up, guaranteeing you,

2098
02:10:08,771 --> 02:10:10,690
the more they're willing
to blow themselves up.

2099
02:10:10,810 --> 02:10:12,760
The more we were talking about
how terrified we are of that,

2100
02:10:12,761 --> 02:10:14,830
the more they're going to employ
those tactics. Absolutely.

2101
02:10:16,300 --> 02:10:17,770
That's the whole secret

2102
02:10:19,330 --> 02:10:23,800
life is like a a workout. If you
look at the way to say, Oh God,

2103
02:10:23,990 --> 02:10:26,230
that's heavy. Oh, I'll
never be able to do that.

2104
02:10:27,130 --> 02:10:30,160
You're not going to be able to work out.
Right? But if you walk in there and go,

2105
02:10:30,161 --> 02:10:34,250
Whoa, that's going to help me.
You know what Bible translation

2106
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:38,510
is? The universe does not like
bitches. That's what it is.

2107
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:42,830
Do Universe frowns upon bitches.
That's what it is.

2108
02:10:43,160 --> 02:10:46,100
The universe doesn't want you gotta. You
gotta get get your shit together, bitch.

2109
02:10:46,260 --> 02:10:49,910
There's a right way every minute of
every day you're taking a decision.

2110
02:10:49,911 --> 02:10:54,140
You're making you carving a path and
choosing to say certain things and go

2111
02:10:54,141 --> 02:10:57,500
certain places and asked her in ways, you
know, you know which way you could go.

2112
02:10:57,510 --> 02:10:59,030
Why,
what it is is a better way

2113
02:10:59,670 --> 02:11:04,670
vibe to see people don't really realize
the kind of vibe they're putting out.

2114
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:08,610
You know, that's why the pedophiles
and that, you know, you know,

2115
02:11:08,611 --> 02:11:13,170
they've had a fucked up life until
they were pursuing it out there.

2116
02:11:13,500 --> 02:11:16,500
But for some reason you get a crowd
of people and all of a sudden you can,

2117
02:11:16,530 --> 02:11:19,740
there's one weird or in there the vibe.

2118
02:11:20,740 --> 02:11:24,750
Oh yeah. Well one angry heckler could
fuck up a whole crowd of 300 people.

2119
02:11:25,080 --> 02:11:25,940
Have you ever had that happen?

2120
02:11:25,950 --> 02:11:28,880
One person just angry for no reason
yelling at you and you're like,

2121
02:11:28,890 --> 02:11:31,510
why is going on with you man?
Like idiot.

2122
02:11:31,820 --> 02:11:33,450
Sometimes it can be
about something you say.

2123
02:11:33,660 --> 02:11:38,430
Like I some woman got Super Mad Cause
I was doing this joke about that.

2124
02:11:39,050 --> 02:11:40,950
The idea being that you shouldn't,

2125
02:11:41,550 --> 02:11:44,420
there's a big difference
between having a man, uh,

2126
02:11:44,520 --> 02:11:49,520
molesting a young girl or young boy
and a woman molesting a young boy.

2127
02:11:49,770 --> 02:11:54,630
Because if a chick's hot, like if a
woman is hot, we barely care. You know,

2128
02:11:54,631 --> 02:11:57,670
you barely care if you hear that,
like some seven year old got,

2129
02:11:57,690 --> 02:12:00,750
if you walked in and there was a seven
year old getting blown by like the

2130
02:12:00,751 --> 02:12:02,850
hottest girl in the world.
And he was like, you know,

2131
02:12:02,851 --> 02:12:07,580
like raising his fist
and triumph. And I, uh,

2132
02:12:07,740 --> 02:12:12,030
I saw this woman go, that's it. That's
it. And she gets up and she's like,

2133
02:12:12,031 --> 02:12:15,210
fuck this, I'm not listening to this.
This is fucking terrible. It's disgusting.

2134
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:17,580
And as she was saying,
she's like walking through the club,

2135
02:12:17,590 --> 02:12:19,920
just like poisoning the atmosphere,
the club.

2136
02:12:20,160 --> 02:12:23,280
I got lucky that I turned it
into a pot. I was like, listen,

2137
02:12:23,281 --> 02:12:24,690
I just want to point
out that there was no,

2138
02:12:24,810 --> 02:12:28,230
this is a work of fiction and no real
babies were blowing during the making of

2139
02:12:28,231 --> 02:12:32,780
any of this material. So I started going
on this explanation about it. You know,

2140
02:12:33,270 --> 02:12:37,140
Stephen King Movie, Carrie can light
things on fire with her eyes, right?

2141
02:12:37,440 --> 02:12:40,050
But you're telling me that some seven
year old kid wouldn't like getting his

2142
02:12:40,051 --> 02:12:43,790
dick sucked in my fiction. That's
much more likely. It's very,

2143
02:12:44,100 --> 02:12:47,940
very, very touchy because
a lot of people probably,

2144
02:12:47,941 --> 02:12:50,120
she's probably went through some,
some weird,

2145
02:12:50,420 --> 02:12:53,220
a lot of people. I think a lot
of people, I think, you know,

2146
02:12:53,240 --> 02:12:57,530
I dodged a bullet twice in my youth
from being molested once when I was like

2147
02:12:57,531 --> 02:13:00,140
eight and once when I was
like 13 I dodged two bullets.

2148
02:13:00,410 --> 02:13:03,020
I got to think a lot of people get hit.
A lot of people get fragged.

2149
02:13:03,190 --> 02:13:07,960
Well, I, I got well kind of molested
when I was learning how to swim.

2150
02:13:08,500 --> 02:13:08,950
Really?

2151
02:13:08,950 --> 02:13:13,570
They had free swimming lessons at
the Ymc a the only problem was,

2152
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:18,280
or the only thing was that we didn't
need bathing suits. Oh, Jesus Christ.

2153
02:13:19,480 --> 02:13:24,480
There were literally 2020
young guys with no baby.

2154
02:13:24,970 --> 02:13:28,330
Oh my God. Women learn
how to swim. Oh my God.

2155
02:13:28,331 --> 02:13:32,220
And when the YMC guys were
okay, one more time. Oh my God.

2156
02:13:32,221 --> 02:13:36,390
Hey boys are there again? Okay. No, you're
doing good. So he's just watching you.

2157
02:13:36,391 --> 02:13:40,230
Was he touching? No, no. Just, just,
just wash it. Teaching you how to swim.

2158
02:13:41,300 --> 02:13:43,560
He asshole. But, but what was, I mean,

2159
02:13:44,170 --> 02:13:47,420
why do you stand behind the podium and
beat off or you guys are swimming and

2160
02:13:47,421 --> 02:13:52,400
never really see at the time, you
know, you don't. You don't. Yeah,

2161
02:13:52,430 --> 02:13:53,960
you're totally, you're busy. Yeah. Yeah.

2162
02:13:54,270 --> 02:13:57,780
And then then another time I was,

2163
02:13:59,040 --> 02:14:00,660
I would've never got really hit on it.

2164
02:14:00,670 --> 02:14:04,450
I was playing basketball
at the Y in Hollywood and

2165
02:14:07,130 --> 02:14:09,390
there's a locker room there.
No, this is a New York.

2166
02:14:09,450 --> 02:14:14,450
It's a New York City and there's
a locker and this guy comes up.

2167
02:14:15,290 --> 02:14:16,123
You went to

2168
02:14:17,700 --> 02:14:22,480
catch a buzz later and looked around
to see who was talking to you.

2169
02:14:22,550 --> 02:14:26,100
He said, no, you, I'm talking to you.
Do you want to catch a buzz later?

2170
02:14:27,300 --> 02:14:29,190
I says,
I don't think so.

2171
02:14:29,980 --> 02:14:34,980
And then he reaches into his locker and
pulls up the sickest pair of glasses

2172
02:14:35,701 --> 02:14:38,880
I've ever seen. He puts some on,
he looks at me goes, oh, nevermind.

2173
02:14:39,130 --> 02:14:43,000
I'm sorry. Oh, that's
hilarious. Do you think that is?

2174
02:14:43,001 --> 02:14:46,390
He thought you were someone else or he
found out what you're really looked like

2175
02:14:46,450 --> 02:14:48,280
and he's like, damn, I
can do better than this.

2176
02:14:51,630 --> 02:14:54,590
He's like, I'm not ready to
cash in my tag this early.

2177
02:14:55,010 --> 02:14:58,610
I'm still going to go out hunting.
I think that's what it was.

2178
02:15:02,080 --> 02:15:04,560
Oh, sorry. Wrong, wrong, wrong guy.

2179
02:15:04,620 --> 02:15:07,830
So how often are you going out and
doing stand up now and if so, how?

2180
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:08,880
How can people see you?

2181
02:15:09,340 --> 02:15:13,690
We got one more gig again. The Ice
House. You should do the ice house.

2182
02:15:13,691 --> 02:15:18,140
You ever do the Ice House to show started
here? Did you really? Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

2183
02:15:18,150 --> 02:15:21,340
Bugs dangerous to come.
You never paid us.

2184
02:15:21,480 --> 02:15:26,440
They paid us all he did pay us.
Wasn't much 50 bucks I think for,

2185
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:27,353
for both of us.

2186
02:15:27,670 --> 02:15:31,540
This is back in 1970 70

2187
02:15:31,810 --> 02:15:36,170
so was 50 bucks worth back then it
was like 100 bucks. 500 bucks. Yeah,

2188
02:15:36,900 --> 02:15:40,060
it was a lot of money was, it
was 50 bucks. I'm trying to,

2189
02:15:40,061 --> 02:15:42,880
trying to put it in perspective.
Well, we weren't working right.

2190
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:47,180
What was it worth today like with
the inflation? Was He what was gay?

2191
02:15:47,260 --> 02:15:51,910
I don't know. Could you say
like a couple hundred bucks?
Five bucks, five? No, no, no.

2192
02:15:51,911 --> 02:15:56,410
What was it? Oh, so it's five times
more. Yeah. Okay, so 250 bucks. Yeah.

2193
02:15:56,740 --> 02:15:57,740
Oh yeah.
Okay.

2194
02:15:57,741 --> 02:16:00,550
And so every time you work you got to
eat and pay rent and all that shit.

2195
02:16:01,140 --> 02:16:03,010
The little bit of rent and
a little bit of what was,

2196
02:16:03,011 --> 02:16:07,220
I got a month's rent an apartment back

2197
02:16:07,630 --> 02:16:10,420

Mark David Letterman's contract is
on the wall from him working here.

2200
02:16:17,640 --> 02:16:19,780
He,
he got pissed off at teaching job

2201
02:16:19,860 --> 02:16:24,030
because after we made it, we made a big,
we mentioned every club but the ice, I was

2202
02:16:25,590 --> 02:16:27,750
immediate mentioned the ice house.
Forgot about it.

2203
02:16:30,440 --> 02:16:31,860
Fucking Pasadena man.

2204
02:16:33,880 --> 02:16:38,350
We, we the Troubadour, we mentioned
the troubadour view other clubs.

2205
02:16:38,620 --> 02:16:41,530
This is my favorite club in the
country. And then, then the ISOS,

2206
02:16:41,590 --> 02:16:46,060
I mean comedy wise we, we, we killed
he, he had a clean policy for years.

2207
02:16:46,230 --> 02:16:49,860
Did it really? Oh that's hilarious.
Cause now Joey Diaz does every Wednesday.

2208
02:16:50,490 --> 02:16:54,690
Whom do you know? Joey D is? Joey
D. He's a good friend of ours.

2209
02:16:54,691 --> 02:16:59,100
He's a podcast all the time.
Stand up comedian Cuban guy. Oh,

2210
02:16:59,101 --> 02:17:03,690
I'm thinking of Nick Diaz is a fighter.
A fighter. I know it is. Yeah. No,

2211
02:17:03,691 --> 02:17:07,320
Joey Diaz is probably the funniest
guy in the planet. Is He? Yeah, he's,

2212
02:17:07,360 --> 02:17:09,870
my friend does been friends
with him for like 10 years.

2213
02:17:10,020 --> 02:17:12,930
I don't know anybody who makes me laugh.
One that guy more than 10 years. Shit.

2214
02:17:13,050 --> 02:17:17,490
Me and genuine friends like 15. And he
is stand up. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2215
02:17:17,520 --> 02:17:21,750
He's hilarious. Ridiculous. We're
dateless pot at two. Oh, of course.

2216
02:17:21,780 --> 02:17:23,730
Every day he's going to start doing,

2217
02:17:23,731 --> 02:17:26,310
Joey's going to start doing
a new Ustream show, uh,

2218
02:17:26,430 --> 02:17:30,270
two or three days a week by himself at
six o'clock in the morning cause he gets

2219
02:17:30,271 --> 02:17:33,810
up at six and he smokes weed and listens
to music and then he goes for a walk

2220
02:17:33,811 --> 02:17:35,550
and I'll go to this dispensary,
you know,

2221
02:17:35,551 --> 02:17:40,230
bias weed and he's going to document
it all on Ustream. So every morning,

2222
02:17:40,290 --> 02:17:43,680
you know how many days a week he chooses
to do this is going to do it at least

2223
02:17:43,710 --> 02:17:46,470
twice. He says he's going to get up at
six o'clock in the morning. He goes,

2224
02:17:46,471 --> 02:17:49,470
I'm gonna put on a fucking lecture
for these cocksuckers is how he talks.

2225
02:17:49,770 --> 02:17:53,190
He doesn't want to play them the right
music. I want to get that Ustream working.

2226
02:17:53,670 --> 02:17:56,850
He goes every day. Fuck
it. I'm up. Anyway, I'm up
anyway. Six o'clock and went,

2227
02:17:56,851 --> 02:18:00,900
got Baba. Just going to start there. And
he works here all the time. Oh yeah. Yeah,

2228
02:18:00,901 --> 02:18:02,880
all the time. What's, which
is hilarious. He's so dirty.

2229
02:18:02,881 --> 02:18:04,380
He's like one of the dirtiest guys ever.

2230
02:18:04,620 --> 02:18:06,420
And he's like a regular
here while staying.

2231
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:07,553
Oh Bob.

2232
02:18:07,770 --> 02:18:12,180
At first gen they literally told them
and then all the street lamp in people,

2233
02:18:12,181 --> 02:18:15,780
you know, they would come and make an
appearance here. Right. And it was very,

2234
02:18:15,781 --> 02:18:16,650
very straight.

2235
02:18:17,080 --> 02:18:18,760
That's funny.
Well Times change.

2236
02:18:19,140 --> 02:18:22,560
Well Cheech and Chong, well we did our
active, you know, we never held back.

2237
02:18:23,400 --> 02:18:27,510
Did anybody ever tried to censor
you? Not really good. Lately,

2238
02:18:27,870 --> 02:18:32,460
lately we were at a casino in Biloxi,
Mississippi,

2239
02:18:32,461 --> 02:18:37,380
Mississippi. And I'm just about to do
the show, you know, doing a sound check.

2240
02:18:37,381 --> 02:18:42,381
Got My son a working the roadie and
we're setting the mix up in that.

2241
02:18:42,590 --> 02:18:45,970
And then the guy comes over,
he's old, by the way. Um,

2242
02:18:46,500 --> 02:18:49,820
just want to remind you that,
you know, the chief, uh, uh,

2243
02:18:50,400 --> 02:18:54,150
really religious and so you got
to really watch your language.

2244
02:18:55,860 --> 02:18:59,310
We looked at him. What is it?
Yeah, you got to go. I said,

2245
02:18:59,311 --> 02:19:02,870
well what happens if we don't? These
was, he could pull the plug on you. He,

2246
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:07,980
he'd been known to do that.
Wow. So just, wow. Okay.

2247
02:19:08,340 --> 02:19:11,670
So then, uh, I went and told changing,
or the guy came in the dressing room.

2248
02:19:13,470 --> 02:19:17,940
I told [inaudible] it says, teacher,
the guy who wants us to do a clean show.

2249
02:19:18,190 --> 02:19:22,350
And she says, fuck that man. The wounds.
What motherfucking was to do a clean job.

2250
02:19:22,640 --> 02:19:27,000
Tell me, is this a mother fucker? Fuck
that I ain't doing no fucking clean joke.

2251
02:19:28,560 --> 02:19:33,110
What happened? He knew she
was joking. Well, what we did,

2252
02:19:33,111 --> 02:19:37,340
we cut down my wives show cause
she, she, she gets a little,

2253
02:19:37,750 --> 02:19:41,360
a little out there. She gets graphic. Well
she gets a little out there, you know,

2254
02:19:41,361 --> 02:19:44,000
that would, that would piss him
off. You know, Cheech and Chong,

2255
02:19:44,001 --> 02:19:47,660
we never did anything. So it's a sexual
thing he's worried about? No, it was,

2256
02:19:47,661 --> 02:19:52,140
it was just, uh, the, the, what do
you call them? The producer. Right,

2257
02:19:52,340 --> 02:19:55,340
right. But what was the content that they
were worried about? Was it bad words?

2258
02:19:55,341 --> 02:19:58,610
Bad words. Wait, what it was,
he's sucking up to the chief.

2259
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:00,500
You know what it was.

2260
02:20:00,501 --> 02:20:04,150
He never told the chief when Cheech
and Chong and really what a CNA.

2261
02:20:04,190 --> 02:20:07,730
Now at the last moment,
last more he knew.

2262
02:20:08,130 --> 02:20:12,530
But then when chief didn't know that today
I guess I had a fucking UBA chief and

2263
02:20:12,531 --> 02:20:17,420
not know who Cheech and Chong
is. Well how dairy. But anyway,

2264
02:20:17,421 --> 02:20:19,460
we uh,
it never heard,

2265
02:20:19,580 --> 02:20:23,540
although cheat you did one leader
is that Jesus did do one, uh,

2266
02:20:23,660 --> 02:20:27,570
one bit where we're, a couple of
people got up and left. Really? Yeah.

2267
02:20:27,680 --> 02:20:32,680
What was it that was his is favored a
director and he turned out to be Roman

2268
02:20:34,940 --> 02:20:39,590
Polanski. Rodriguez. Paul Rodriguez.
I know Robert. Robert Rodriguez.

2269
02:20:39,620 --> 02:20:43,220
Robert Rodriguez. Cause he had great
dialogue in his movie. Pussy, Bluesy,

2270
02:20:43,221 --> 02:20:47,760
bluesy got got hairy pussy.
No Fuzzy, hairy, you know,

2271
02:20:47,860 --> 02:20:52,170
rice, all fuzzy, fuzzy, yellow
Posey, any kind of pussy.

2272
02:20:52,740 --> 02:20:57,520
Get it right here. That was it. A
couple of pussies got up. We've heard,

2273
02:21:00,370 --> 02:21:03,860
it's funny how people in
comedy clubs want to change.

2274
02:21:03,910 --> 02:21:08,400
Want to change your act when they like
tune, they want to drive the car. Yeah,

2275
02:21:08,510 --> 02:21:10,790
they didn't. They just want
to have it over you. Sure.

2276
02:21:11,360 --> 02:21:13,910
They don't like the fact that
you're getting all the attention.

2277
02:21:14,180 --> 02:21:18,550
The worst is when you get booked into
a club and then once you get to go,

2278
02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:22,550
especially if you're like, when I was,
you know, I was like middling. I couldn't,

2279
02:21:22,660 --> 02:21:26,150
it wasn't really making real money and
I would get sent to these clubs in the

2280
02:21:26,151 --> 02:21:29,120
middle of nowhere and you would get
there and they would have like their own

2281
02:21:29,121 --> 02:21:31,610
standards they impose on you.
I'll get off stage.

2282
02:21:31,730 --> 02:21:33,470
I don't know if anybody talked
to you about the language,

2283
02:21:33,471 --> 02:21:34,670
but you can't talk like that.
I'm like,

2284
02:21:35,130 --> 02:21:38,480
you better fucking fire me because this
is what I'm doing because what I do,

2285
02:21:38,510 --> 02:21:40,400
there's only one way to make an audience.
Okay.

2286
02:21:40,401 --> 02:21:42,860
And it's the get people to come back
and see you and you gotta do what you

2287
02:21:42,861 --> 02:21:46,820
actually do. Cause you know, if you
pretend that I got booked with my act,

2288
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:48,850
there's Max, I'm going to
do it. So there was like a,

2289
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:51,860
she had to call the booking agent
and the booking agent. I was like,

2290
02:21:51,861 --> 02:21:54,170
that's what I booked. And this
is a, you know, it's like,

2291
02:21:54,450 --> 02:21:55,640
and she was just in a manager,

2292
02:21:55,670 --> 02:21:58,850
just a manager that decided that she
was going to be a sensor. It wasn't,

2293
02:22:01,610 --> 02:22:04,910
her name was Connie. No,
somewhere in New York. It was, um,

2294
02:22:05,390 --> 02:22:08,930
it was one of those fucking Kong Island.
How many clubs in the middle of nowhere?

2295
02:22:09,140 --> 02:22:10,190
I don't even remember where it was.

2296
02:22:10,191 --> 02:22:13,490
What part of the article was one
of those weird little shitty clubs.

2297
02:22:13,491 --> 02:22:16,670
But that's the thing that a lot of comics
have to go through this club owners,

2298
02:22:16,671 --> 02:22:19,340
you know, they don't want mean,
you don't want to take a chance.

2299
02:22:19,341 --> 02:22:22,880
I have some asshole coming or run all
your customers out. But it's foul humor.

2300
02:22:22,970 --> 02:22:25,830
Well,
I mean you gotta to listen your homework.

2301
02:22:26,250 --> 02:22:27,920
Find out who your booking on that side.

2302
02:22:28,240 --> 02:22:31,950
Exactly. I gave them a tape. The tape
had the same material that I was doing.

2303
02:22:32,370 --> 02:22:34,790
He backed down. That's how you'd
get it. You'd have to get a god up,

2304
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:35,860
make a VHS tape yet.

2305
02:22:35,990 --> 02:22:40,410
But he could make copies of it with two
VHS recorders connected together and you

2306
02:22:40,430 --> 02:22:42,790
always had a friend who knew how to do
that and you can edit it and it was,

2307
02:22:42,791 --> 02:22:46,870
the edits are terrible and it was like
a big fuzzy pause in between sets that

2308
02:22:46,871 --> 02:22:50,260
you did in different places.
So He'd send it out to a club and they go,

2309
02:22:50,261 --> 02:22:52,270
oh that guy's got a good act.
All right, I'll book them.

2310
02:22:52,380 --> 02:22:55,330
And that's how you got work. You'd
have to send tapes out. We'd,

2311
02:22:55,340 --> 02:22:59,230
there'll be a big part of your job trying
to get go places and sent tapes out

2312
02:22:59,790 --> 02:23:01,230
when,
when you guys

2313
02:23:01,320 --> 02:23:05,520
were we had, we had albums that
we send out. That's what we did.

2314
02:23:05,550 --> 02:23:08,220
That's what it was. That's what got
people to come and see. You guys.

2315
02:23:08,580 --> 02:23:10,890
Did you have to do radio or
anything back from those guys?

2316
02:23:11,730 --> 02:23:14,940
I still do radio to let people
know in town. I love doing radio.

2317
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:19,540
How often are you on Twitter? She
doesn't like. I try to be every day.

2318
02:23:19,620 --> 02:23:24,600
But she doesn't like radio and,
no. No. How come? He's his lazy.

2319
02:23:24,810 --> 02:23:28,740
He's lazy. Is that what it is? Basically.

2320
02:23:29,130 --> 02:23:31,830
Does he like acting more than the former?

2321
02:23:32,250 --> 02:23:36,960
[inaudible] he loves getting paid. Know.
Just talk. Pretend sitting around. Yeah.

2322
02:23:37,030 --> 02:23:39,690
Is that what it is?
He doesn't,

2323
02:23:40,560 --> 02:23:44,620
he's not a threat to them
and see or anybody. Oh,

2324
02:23:44,760 --> 02:23:47,010
stage. Yeah. I'm not even
sure what that means.

2325
02:23:50,920 --> 02:23:55,780
So he doesn't like, he's not,
he's not like going up on
weeknights and working on,

2326
02:23:56,460 --> 02:23:56,720
no,

2327
02:23:56,720 --> 02:24:01,390
no, no, no, no, no, no, no. In fact
he never, he never, he, he went out.

2328
02:24:01,440 --> 02:24:05,590
What did he do? He went out and Mcu the
Latin kings of comedy. Right, right.

2329
02:24:05,650 --> 02:24:07,210
That's about it.
What was the,

2330
02:24:07,240 --> 02:24:10,000
did you ever ask him what it was like
working with Don Johnson fellows years.

2331
02:24:10,230 --> 02:24:13,340
Little bit. I've heard of it. Dot.
I got a different, we've got a,

2332
02:24:13,480 --> 02:24:18,400
we're got to walk on tip toes
around him. Oh really? Yeah.

2333
02:24:18,680 --> 02:24:22,540
Is it because you guys
just worked together for so
long and just know there is

2334
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:25,450
few bad decisions made that we don't,

2335
02:24:29,930 --> 02:24:33,790
you know, when, when we broke up the,
the, the bond was broken, you know,

2336
02:24:34,660 --> 02:24:39,640
I mean, no, I mean there's still
memories, you know, it's almost like a,

2337
02:24:39,710 --> 02:24:44,590
like an ex wife, you know, get together
for the kids. Right. That's weird, man.

2338
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:49,090
What, what, what drove you guys apart?
Was it ego? Was it money was, no,

2339
02:24:49,091 --> 02:24:52,660
it was fear of not working.
I think.

2340
02:24:52,970 --> 02:24:56,260
Fear of not working. Yeah. Well,
Cheech, soon as he got offered,

2341
02:24:56,920 --> 02:24:59,050
offered something on his own,
he took it.

2342
02:25:00,580 --> 02:25:03,460
Was it that or was that just he
didn't want it to be independent,

2343
02:25:03,680 --> 02:25:07,030
wanting to be able to make his own money.
I think a lot of it,

2344
02:25:07,150 --> 02:25:11,070
he didn't like the fact that
I was the Alpha Dog. You were,

2345
02:25:11,080 --> 02:25:14,080
the guy wrote every saying,
well, I directed for sure.

2346
02:25:15,080 --> 02:25:18,000
I direct it and a lot of decisions,
I made all the decisions, you know,

2347
02:25:18,580 --> 02:25:20,380
I wonder the decisions I made.
Uh,

2348
02:25:20,990 --> 02:25:24,090
we got offered a big
television contract back in the

2349
02:25:24,610 --> 02:25:28,690
back in the day, you know, and
I turned it down, you know,

2350
02:25:28,880 --> 02:25:33,610
the big money, you know, I, I don't know
how I did it, but I did it. I just said,

2351
02:25:33,660 --> 02:25:35,710
well, what are they trying to get
you to do? It was on a sitcom. Well,

2352
02:25:35,711 --> 02:25:40,090
it ended up being Chico in the man.
In fact,

2353
02:25:40,091 --> 02:25:44,110
there was one that Chico and the man was
one of our bits. Whoa. Jimmy Coleman.

2354
02:25:44,920 --> 02:25:48,670
Jimmy carmax followed us
around for four months.

2355
02:25:48,671 --> 02:25:53,410
Chico and the man was one of
your bits. Yeah. How did it
go? What was it like? Well,

2356
02:25:53,411 --> 02:25:58,411
we did a bit called old man in the park
and the Chicano would come up with a

2357
02:25:59,800 --> 02:26:01,630
comb. Yeah. Real tough guy.

2358
02:26:02,110 --> 02:26:07,060
And the old guy and him would have
a little argument, you know, and uh,

2359
02:26:07,150 --> 02:26:08,410
I would,
I would insult them.

2360
02:26:08,950 --> 02:26:13,210
Pretty soon I just copied that and turned
it into what he did. He got an old man,

2361
02:26:13,220 --> 02:26:18,220
Albert Chico. Freddie, Freddie Prinze,
and they turned it into a sitcom.

2362
02:26:18,760 --> 02:26:19,960
Yeah.
For folks who don't know,

2363
02:26:19,961 --> 02:26:24,961
Freddie prints for one small but brief
moment in time was one of the biggest

2364
02:26:25,271 --> 02:26:27,910
stars in the country.
We see huge television star.

2365
02:26:28,150 --> 02:26:30,720
Huge one crazy and committed
suicide. Yeah. Yeah.

2366
02:26:30,960 --> 02:26:34,180
And then he tried to show without them.
And that's one of the reasons that, that,

2367
02:26:34,181 --> 02:26:34,870
um,

2368
02:26:34,870 --> 02:26:39,550
that I turned down and television
because I don't like losing control.

2369
02:26:39,770 --> 02:26:44,740
Right. I found nothing works. If
I don't have control of something,

2370
02:26:45,250 --> 02:26:48,550
we don't sell anything and nothing works.
What's not going to be your vision?

2371
02:26:48,730 --> 02:26:51,480
It's going to be someone's idea
of what your relationship be. It,

2372
02:26:51,481 --> 02:26:53,500
it's not the same thing.
You know what it is. It's,

2373
02:26:53,501 --> 02:26:57,430
it's someone's vision that doesn't
have a, an offer, you know,

2374
02:26:57,431 --> 02:26:59,350
it's a production company that goes,
Hey,

2375
02:26:59,351 --> 02:27:02,230
I got a great idea right you
to teach you you're this.

2376
02:27:02,230 --> 02:27:05,770
And they're the ones who put up the money.
So they want, they want money and that,

2377
02:27:05,780 --> 02:27:06,570
uh,
and,

2378
02:27:06,570 --> 02:27:11,410
and we tried to sell a bunch of stuff
lately and no one's interested in.

2379
02:27:11,470 --> 02:27:15,760
Yeah. I mean, because Noah's a is the
best filter in this town, you know,

2380
02:27:15,820 --> 02:27:18,590
just say no.
And if the guy wants a bad Nuffield,

2381
02:27:18,670 --> 02:27:20,800
we'll keep at it until you say yes.

2382
02:27:21,460 --> 02:27:23,860
But when they see nobody Cheech
and Chong and it's like, oh, okay,

2383
02:27:23,861 --> 02:27:28,540
next let's go somewhere else. And you
guys are icons, you know together.

2384
02:27:28,541 --> 02:27:30,730
You guys doing a comedy show is a no fail.

2385
02:27:30,760 --> 02:27:34,600
It's like if you are a respectable stoner
and Cheech and Chong coming in Denver,

2386
02:27:34,630 --> 02:27:38,440
you got to go see them. But what we
have to do, like if it's on television,

2387
02:27:38,441 --> 02:27:42,670
we can't have it watered down.
CanNot be, why go on television.

2388
02:27:42,850 --> 02:27:44,110
Just stick with the Internet man.

2389
02:27:44,230 --> 02:27:49,120
Do something like this shot Ustream show
you guys fucking fill arenas everyday

2390
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:52,150
of the week. You do do a like a
youtube show or used to didn't you?

2391
02:27:52,151 --> 02:27:56,230
Or like a like a blog type video.
Yeah, I did. I did a lot of that. Yeah.

2392
02:27:56,500 --> 02:27:59,560
I that those were really interesting.
And you stopped doing them or yeah,

2393
02:27:59,561 --> 02:28:03,930
well we went on tour and then I
couldn't get, the mics were good.

2394
02:28:04,820 --> 02:28:07,400
Oh, that's hilarious. And
you know, we don't have a,

2395
02:28:07,540 --> 02:28:11,020
my son actually set it up and we
start off with what are you doing?

2396
02:28:11,021 --> 02:28:14,320
Your podcast out of my house.
You're going to do it out of your house.

2397
02:28:14,370 --> 02:28:16,930
Are you setting up like a studio then?
Yeah, I got it set up. It's all set.

2398
02:28:17,320 --> 02:28:20,060
Ready to go. I'm just waiting
to wait til September. Oh,

2399
02:28:20,090 --> 02:28:21,980
well my son gets back in or you want to

2400
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:25,130
do it with him? I'm going to wait until
he gets back and then kind of build up.

2401
02:28:25,131 --> 02:28:28,790
Build up the anticipation. The
anticipation. That's a good idea.

2402
02:28:28,791 --> 02:28:32,720
You're clever looking at
you. You marketing genius.
We never thought about that.

2403
02:28:33,120 --> 02:28:35,690
He just started at, uh,
just fucking goofing on it.

2404
02:28:35,930 --> 02:28:39,890
I've never even tried to promote this
time. This things became this by itself.

2405
02:28:39,920 --> 02:28:44,510
But you could tell like, look where
it is or room. What do you need?

2406
02:28:44,540 --> 02:28:45,800
How many clubs? Yeah, that's all you do.

2407
02:28:45,801 --> 02:28:49,340
Need Room with fucking cool shit
on the wall and some mannequins.

2408
02:28:49,350 --> 02:28:53,900
Look like Brian's ex girlfriend. A toilet
in a toilet that flushes and zombies.

2409
02:28:54,140 --> 02:28:55,890
Yeah. By the way, we're
getting up at day here. Dude,

2410
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:00,470
we're getting one of those electronic
crazy things. I'll, when it all happened,

2411
02:29:00,740 --> 02:29:02,870
I mentioned on the podcast,
it's a um,

2412
02:29:02,960 --> 02:29:06,540
a company that is offered to send us
one of those cool Japanese butthole

2413
02:29:06,590 --> 02:29:11,570
cleaning time. So sites, those are
main was in Tokyo in the bathroom.

2414
02:29:11,810 --> 02:29:14,500
I couldn't get out of
all the wonderful heat.

2415
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:18,710
It squirts water rate in your asshole
and you just don't want to get up.

2416
02:29:18,711 --> 02:29:19,450
You just beat off.

2417
02:29:19,450 --> 02:29:23,600
Did you know I just sat there for like
10 minutes just letting it just do that.

2418
02:29:23,601 --> 02:29:27,020
Yeah. I beat off once, once during
the week and it was fantastic.

2419
02:29:27,250 --> 02:29:32,010
Great warm water tickling your
butthole. UHHH. Why is that so terrible?

2420
02:29:32,020 --> 02:29:35,630
Is it, how could it be so bad? I feel
so good. That's what I have to say.

2421
02:29:35,660 --> 02:29:38,960
What the Japanese are
into the claims ledger to,

2422
02:29:39,010 --> 02:29:42,170
they feel like you've figured out a lot
of shit about martial arts too and they

2423
02:29:42,171 --> 02:29:43,390
make a bad ass car.
Yeah.

2424
02:29:43,400 --> 02:29:47,060
They are super clean people like they
just like get eight to take showers,

2425
02:29:47,061 --> 02:29:48,020
multiple times evolved.

2426
02:29:48,470 --> 02:29:52,850
They evolved on a totally different
line than western America.

2427
02:29:52,850 --> 02:29:54,200
It's very fascinating to me.

2428
02:29:54,201 --> 02:29:57,530
When I look at Japanese culture and I
think it's amazing the Samurai culture,

2429
02:29:57,531 --> 02:30:00,440
the fact that there's so many martial
arts, I, Kido, Jujitsu, karate,

2430
02:30:00,590 --> 02:30:03,250
all these different things come
out of Japan, you know, so,

2431
02:30:03,251 --> 02:30:07,400
so much comes out of Japan, so it's an
amazing place. Well, Japan, the Japan,

2432
02:30:07,401 --> 02:30:11,750
we'll take it and refine it. They'll take
somebody else's. I like martial arts.

2433
02:30:11,751 --> 02:30:15,620
We took it from India cars.
They'll refine it into something.

2434
02:30:16,460 --> 02:30:20,300
The Prius. I drive a Prius. All my
friends, how dare you, you hippie.

2435
02:30:20,470 --> 02:30:24,500
[inaudible] hippie. Yeah. The
everybody loves those things.

2436
02:30:25,020 --> 02:30:29,750
Here's a perfect, don't give a shit about
a car. A car you can have, you know,

2437
02:30:29,751 --> 02:30:31,340
just there it is.
It's a car.

2438
02:30:31,540 --> 02:30:35,180
It gets me from here to
there and it easy on gas.

2439
02:30:35,181 --> 02:30:37,700
And you can put those in
the sound like the Mustang.

2440
02:30:37,701 --> 02:30:38,690
You know what I'm talking about?

2441
02:30:38,870 --> 02:30:42,440
Tommy Chong and you fire up a
Shelby gt 500 and you hit that.

2442
02:30:46,840 --> 02:30:51,640
You can shift your own gears. You fucking
fucking man again when the trouble is,

2443
02:30:51,660 --> 02:30:55,640
all you see in your future
is traffic school. Yeah.

2444
02:30:55,641 --> 02:30:57,170
You know you can't be an asshole with it.

2445
02:30:57,171 --> 02:31:01,760
But even just regular driving when you
drive a car like a Mustang, I tried to

2446
02:31:03,830 --> 02:31:08,420
customize my Prius and so I change
the exhaust. Had it lowered,

2447
02:31:08,710 --> 02:31:12,650
I heavily headed on a hydraulics,
hydraulics.

2448
02:31:12,740 --> 02:31:15,080
Wouldn't that defeat the whole purpose
all the way to the hydraulics and make

2449
02:31:15,081 --> 02:31:19,830
the gas mileage terrible? No,
no. Forget gas. I had dual pipes.

2450
02:31:20,120 --> 02:31:24,840
I had the, did you really have all
this stuff? I haven't really had it.

2451
02:31:24,870 --> 02:31:28,710
I had the tail lights blacked out.
You been murdered? That bitch.

2452
02:31:28,740 --> 02:31:33,740
And then I ended up getting arrested or
getting a ticket really for everything.

2453
02:31:34,740 --> 02:31:36,270
Well for the tail lights for sure.

2454
02:31:36,630 --> 02:31:40,890
And then I had to go to court and
the guy was a fan and he says,

2455
02:31:40,891 --> 02:31:44,250
well come back at one o'clock you know?
And so I come back and when I thought,

2456
02:31:44,280 --> 02:31:47,520
you know the judges coming back,
we'll see. Thank you. Goodbye.

2457
02:31:47,940 --> 02:31:49,980
I had a stand up front of the thing.

2458
02:31:50,070 --> 02:31:54,510
How do you plead and get a
tech to get a $10 fine to him?

2459
02:31:54,660 --> 02:31:57,300
Yeah.
$10 wait for everybody.

2460
02:31:57,360 --> 02:32:00,490
$10 because your car had tinted,
uh,

2461
02:32:00,540 --> 02:32:04,150
brake lights is that
silly picture. So, so I,

2462
02:32:04,280 --> 02:32:09,180
I just took it right back to what it was.
And what word statement?

2463
02:32:09,240 --> 02:32:12,450
Well, was it better looking once
he falls? It was phenomenal.

2464
02:32:13,500 --> 02:32:15,930
It looks so good because I could
lower it right onto the ground.

2465
02:32:15,990 --> 02:32:19,410
Have you ever seen the Lotus car that they
made out of? Yeah. Yeah. The hamp Lotus,

2466
02:32:20,100 --> 02:32:22,150
I think, no, I don't even want,

2467
02:32:22,170 --> 02:32:26,340
they showed pictures of it on this podcast
before Lotus made a call. By the way,

2468
02:32:26,341 --> 02:32:28,640
the first car, you know,
that was made at a Hamp,

2469
02:32:29,100 --> 02:32:31,470
Henry Ford had body panels,

2470
02:32:31,471 --> 02:32:34,600
made it a ham and his videos of
him hitting it with a hammer. Yeah.

2471
02:32:34,680 --> 02:32:35,580
And it bounces up.

2472
02:32:35,910 --> 02:32:39,960
People don't really believe like half
the Shit I say because obviously no

2473
02:32:39,961 --> 02:32:44,780
scientist and I'm half retarded.
But if you just watch some of the video,

2474
02:32:44,781 --> 02:32:49,770
so what, what's capable and
possible with the, the hemp that's,

2475
02:32:49,771 --> 02:32:52,050
that's constructed into body panels.

2476
02:32:52,200 --> 02:32:54,480
It's amazing that they don't
do it today to this day.

2477
02:32:54,540 --> 02:32:58,500
Well they had the electric car too.
I wonder how much it would cost to get,

2478
02:32:58,830 --> 02:33:01,140
this is a good question. I'm going to
put this out there to the universe.

2479
02:33:01,620 --> 02:33:05,910
How much would it cost to get a corvette
and replace all those fiberglass body

2480
02:33:05,911 --> 02:33:10,770
panels with hemp and have it in
the exact same shape? I don't know.

2481
02:33:11,160 --> 02:33:14,010
I would be willing to struggle.
I can make you do it. Please.

2482
02:33:14,340 --> 02:33:17,070
I'd be willing to spend a lot of money
that go to the can and take a leak and

2483
02:33:17,071 --> 02:33:19,330
then we'll come back and wrap this up.
Oh,

2484
02:33:19,490 --> 02:33:22,260
can I just want to thank everyone that
came to that Doug Benson taping that we

2485
02:33:22,261 --> 02:33:24,480
did the other day.
It was,

2486
02:33:24,481 --> 02:33:29,110
I mean they people pride all of garden
bread sticks to me and people stoled

2487
02:33:29,150 --> 02:33:32,430
olive garden menus and sensory David List.
But I'll phone was Vegas.

2488
02:33:32,490 --> 02:33:36,270
Oh this great. How Fun was dice dice that,
that, that was another thing I forgot.

2489
02:33:36,270 --> 02:33:37,290
Completely forgot about that.

2490
02:33:37,291 --> 02:33:40,650
We went to go see dice and I was really
kind of in the back of my head thinking,

2491
02:33:40,651 --> 02:33:45,240
all right, this is not going
to be as good. I don't think
I, you know, I, I, I just,

2492
02:33:45,241 --> 02:33:45,641
I don't know.

2493
02:33:45,641 --> 02:33:48,990
It's for some reason I just didn't think
like he was going to be as good as in

2494
02:33:48,991 --> 02:33:53,510
my head. Well I'm just being honest,
but he, I understand you'd be not,

2495
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:54,870
he blew me.
I wait.

2496
02:33:54,990 --> 02:33:59,250
Oh you been think I was
going to be good fucking guy.

2497
02:33:59,280 --> 02:34:04,080
His jokes per minute like he is, he's
just like Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam.

2498
02:34:04,081 --> 02:34:09,060
Both here for red crew, whatever the
fuck his name is. This cock sucker. No,

2499
02:34:09,061 --> 02:34:11,160
I mean like there were certain
people you're, you're, you know,

2500
02:34:11,161 --> 02:34:13,480
after a while you're like, I wonder if
they still have it and you know, and,

2501
02:34:13,481 --> 02:34:18,040
and that's just what I kind of thought.
Never doubted for a, yeah, we would have

2502
02:34:18,070 --> 02:34:18,461
never done,

2503
02:34:18,461 --> 02:34:21,920
I've always been a dice clay fan watching
when I used to work at the comedy

2504
02:34:21,921 --> 02:34:22,840
store story.
So loved,

2505
02:34:22,850 --> 02:34:27,310
watch them get angry and yell at people
and put like Heelys dice mean, you know,

2506
02:34:27,340 --> 02:34:28,690
he keeps the big set up to this day.

2507
02:34:28,691 --> 02:34:32,320
Cause I was say I love what dice mean
comes out cause he was fucking torture

2508
02:34:32,321 --> 02:34:36,070
people. And he's in character, so
there's shitty says it's so crazy.

2509
02:34:36,250 --> 02:34:38,500
That's his character is,
in my opinion,

2510
02:34:38,650 --> 02:34:40,930
one of the funniest characters
in the history of comedy.

2511
02:34:41,080 --> 02:34:43,090
And a lot of people misunderstand.

2512
02:34:43,200 --> 02:34:48,010
A lot of people get mad at him and say
it that don't ask is misogynism this is

2513
02:34:48,011 --> 02:34:51,580
racism. This is, this is, this
is how he really thinks you're,

2514
02:34:51,640 --> 02:34:54,490
you couldn't be further from the truth.
You couldn't be more wrong.

2515
02:34:54,610 --> 02:34:56,980
He's a combination of reality and fiction.

2516
02:34:57,070 --> 02:35:01,960
He's a Schumann walking amalgam edge.
But what does it work? Amalgamated them.

2517
02:35:02,080 --> 02:35:05,500
Knock on them quickly.
Amalgamated them. No.

2518
02:35:05,740 --> 02:35:08,920
What does the word Amalgam eyes when
he amalgamates what does the hell,

2519
02:35:08,950 --> 02:35:12,340
what the hell is the word? Human Amalgam
in them. No, that's not the word.

2520
02:35:13,120 --> 02:35:15,580
You're using two bigger words.
Yeah. Well, whatever it is,

2521
02:35:15,610 --> 02:35:20,090
he's a combination of reality
and his creation. He's,

2522
02:35:20,100 --> 02:35:23,020
he's dice clay. He, and when
you watch them, you understand.

2523
02:35:23,021 --> 02:35:26,980
If you go and watch like a full, like hour
set, he doesn't mean what he's saying.

2524
02:35:27,170 --> 02:35:30,910
Aye. I, we came backstage after the
show and he goes, this dice clay.

2525
02:35:31,260 --> 02:35:33,630
We came backstage after the show and
he was so happy that we're there.

2526
02:35:33,640 --> 02:35:34,570
It was because it came with,
uh,

2527
02:35:34,630 --> 02:35:38,110
Jim Norton and Anthony Kamiya
from opiate and Claudia and Kelly,

2528
02:35:38,140 --> 02:35:42,100
Robert Kelly and Bryan. It's Sam
Roberts. And so we all came backstage.

2529
02:35:42,180 --> 02:35:45,220
We're telling them how great it was
and everything. He was so happy,

2530
02:35:45,400 --> 02:35:47,980
but he was like, he'll, teal tells
you his formula. He goes, he goes,

2531
02:35:47,981 --> 02:35:51,580
I do know research. He goes,
I'm rob about everything I say,

2532
02:35:51,790 --> 02:35:56,170
but I say it with such conviction,
you know, he knows what he's doing.

2533
02:35:56,171 --> 02:36:00,640
I guess it's this creation and it was
fucking awesome. We had a great time.

2534
02:36:00,641 --> 02:36:04,180
That was some of the hardest, I've
laughed at to stand up comedy in a while.

2535
02:36:04,940 --> 02:36:09,680
He's got that great New York
attitude. It's an attitude.
Yeah. Well he's perfected

2536
02:36:11,680 --> 02:36:15,920
the gangsters, goofy, the gangsters
tapes, you know, they'll do it every time.

2537
02:36:16,130 --> 02:36:20,300
I remember one time I was in Banff where
to some conventions or zone and the

2538
02:36:20,301 --> 02:36:24,440
mountains and beautiful that. And then
when, when, where's the record of Banff,

2539
02:36:24,441 --> 02:36:25,960
Alberta?
It's in the rocky mountains,

2540
02:36:25,961 --> 02:36:30,961
like timber in the middle of the
ski area and we're standing outside.

2541
02:36:31,420 --> 02:36:35,210
The New York guy looked,
he ain't nature at cocksucker.

2542
02:36:38,340 --> 02:36:41,970
I bet it was Joey Diaz.
He's never been to Canada.

2543
02:36:44,590 --> 02:36:49,260
That's it. That is what a guy
from New York would say too.

2544
02:36:49,540 --> 02:36:53,560
Yeah. There's that, that style
of humor. There's really not,

2545
02:36:53,570 --> 02:36:57,570
not like anywhere else. That New York
attitude, it's a very different sort of,

2546
02:36:57,750 --> 02:37:01,530
it's endearing to a certain extent.
Irritating and retarded, you know,

2547
02:37:01,531 --> 02:37:05,220
for the most part. But there's parts
of it, like when dice nails it,

2548
02:37:05,221 --> 02:37:06,180
that's so endearing.

2549
02:37:06,250 --> 02:37:11,110
That's the greatest thing about it
is that it was really fun. Funny.

2550
02:37:11,111 --> 02:37:13,840
I loved this man and you know,
when he did the movie

2551
02:37:15,650 --> 02:37:16,310
sad.

2552
02:37:16,310 --> 02:37:20,600
Oh God, he wasn't good. He had
such a shot yet I shot. Yeah.

2553
02:37:21,020 --> 02:37:25,150
But all he had to do was get a dice clay
to directed in the right. Right, right.

2554
02:37:25,151 --> 02:37:28,460
So all we needed was also while
the protests were going on,

2555
02:37:28,461 --> 02:37:32,080
people are protesting exact women's
group or protesting gay. No,

2556
02:37:32,310 --> 02:37:37,280
but you can't go backwards. You
know, you can't take that shit. Yeah.

2557
02:37:37,281 --> 02:37:42,020
Take, what you got to do is make him
your friend like you do, you know. Well,

2558
02:37:42,021 --> 02:37:43,820
he didn't have,
they didn't have the Internet back then.

2559
02:37:43,821 --> 02:37:46,970
So you needed someone to put
you in something you needed
to, someone to, you know,

2560
02:37:46,971 --> 02:37:51,530
unless you were doing just concerts. But
I mean he had it. He's a good actor. Yeah,

2561
02:37:52,160 --> 02:37:56,570
fine. After I saw him in another
movie, a little low budget movie.

2562
02:37:56,571 --> 02:37:59,540
And you played a serious role. That's
why he's such a good comic. He's got,

2563
02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:03,870
he's got performance chops. Tiny. Yeah.
Yeah. He's been timing. Great timing.

2564
02:38:03,890 --> 02:38:05,780
It was really fun.
We saw him at the Riviera,

2565
02:38:05,781 --> 02:38:09,470
which is also like stepping into a time
capsule because the Riviera has photos

2566
02:38:09,471 --> 02:38:13,760
on the wall from the 1950 [inaudible].
This is the Vegas. He the top of the roof.

2567
02:38:13,850 --> 02:38:16,640
Yeah, the, the theater at the top.
Yeah. He does a bunch of shows there.

2568
02:38:16,641 --> 02:38:20,580
Apparently it does all the time. I worked
there with my wife. Oh, did you? Yeah.

2569
02:38:20,581 --> 02:38:23,480
The Shelby is Shelby.
You know, she, she's uh,

2570
02:38:24,590 --> 02:38:27,050
I am Benatar basically. Right. You know,

2571
02:38:27,051 --> 02:38:30,170
she had never been on stage
and you made her get onstage.

2572
02:38:31,370 --> 02:38:34,720
I'm wondering to come on the road with
me, you know, and she goes, I said,

2573
02:38:34,760 --> 02:38:38,810
I'll put you in the show because she
was taken acting and so she's okay right

2574
02:38:38,811 --> 02:38:40,790
away, you know, you're
very job, she'll do it. So,

2575
02:38:41,030 --> 02:38:45,300
so she did five minutes to an introduce
me. Did you write her material? Oh,

2576
02:38:45,580 --> 02:38:49,850
quite a bit of her stuff, you know, and
I got her, got her going and got her.

2577
02:38:50,600 --> 02:38:54,330
She's doing good now. She's now, she's
happening, you know. And so we're,

2578
02:38:54,390 --> 02:38:57,680
we're doing club after club and we're
doing really good and people loving her in

2579
02:38:57,681 --> 02:39:01,850
that. And so we get, we get
gigged a book was Bobcat,

2580
02:39:02,330 --> 02:39:04,310
Bobcat, Goldthwait, bobcat, Goldthwait.

2581
02:39:06,800 --> 02:39:10,730
Bobcat had just dumped,
it just dumped his wife for a young girl.

2582
02:39:11,810 --> 02:39:15,740
And Shelby mentioned,
mentioned it in her show,

2583
02:39:15,910 --> 02:39:19,900
like she's just doing her show
and she said, oh yeah, bobcat, no,

2584
02:39:19,910 --> 02:39:22,850
you've got the new way. Yeah,
that's something blah, blah, blah.

2585
02:39:23,650 --> 02:39:26,930
Bobcat almost had a miscarriage.

2586
02:39:29,020 --> 02:39:33,760
He literally crying to me crying in tears.

2587
02:39:33,970 --> 02:39:35,690
Did you hear what your wife said to me

2588
02:39:37,350 --> 02:39:41,590
and I looked down at my, this
is the top of the rib. I said,

2589
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:45,260
am I in the wrong club or something?
You know, this is a comedy club.

2590
02:39:45,350 --> 02:39:49,460
That's what you do. This is what
you do. It's just a new wife. Right?

2591
02:39:49,610 --> 02:39:50,510
Why is that bad?

2592
02:39:50,690 --> 02:39:54,260
Why is it bad to have a new wife if you're
in love with someone doing enough to

2593
02:39:54,261 --> 02:39:56,210
marry him? What it was? Why is it bad?

2594
02:39:56,330 --> 02:40:00,890
What it was is that bobcat has a number
of really considered himself a comic.

2595
02:40:01,100 --> 02:40:05,570
What? No, he, he's, he's a movie
director or something, you know,

2596
02:40:05,571 --> 02:40:09,050
but he's never really considered himself,
but he was for a long time.

2597
02:40:09,740 --> 02:40:13,130
He did his act, but it was
a character, you know, that.

2598
02:40:14,450 --> 02:40:16,980
Sure. He still does stand
up and now he's doubly does.

2599
02:40:17,010 --> 02:40:20,070
I think he got over that
character and now he does himself.

2600
02:40:20,350 --> 02:40:22,800
He had him on the podcast.
He actually, no, no, he's,

2601
02:40:22,810 --> 02:40:26,450
he's very talented and all that.
He cried like a,

2602
02:40:26,540 --> 02:40:29,930
like a little fucking baby. You
know? Any want of me? What do,

2603
02:40:29,940 --> 02:40:31,330
what do you want me to
do? Well, what year?

2604
02:40:31,790 --> 02:40:36,570
What year was this in the 90s he
hadn't gotten on the Internet yet.

2605
02:40:36,600 --> 02:40:41,380
He was a baby. Like all of us may
be children of the Times. Yeah.

2606
02:40:41,580 --> 02:40:44,580
I mean, we all needed to be educated
as, I mean, you get, you get sensitive,

2607
02:40:45,010 --> 02:40:48,600
you know, in a comedy club. I mean,
and anybody else, you know, you,

2608
02:40:48,640 --> 02:40:53,210
you take your right here,
hits with everybody else,
you know. That is true. Yeah.

2609
02:40:53,390 --> 02:40:58,350
Yeah. But he was in Craig, especially at
a comedy. Craig was there. Same place.

2610
02:40:58,670 --> 02:41:03,180
No, no. This was in the, in
Vegas. At the river. At the
top of them. And he was there.

2611
02:41:03,480 --> 02:41:04,620
It crazy killing hookers.

2612
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:09,630
He came with some weird chick.
Yeah.

2613
02:41:09,660 --> 02:41:14,610
But the bobcat and Bobcat
was, oh, he was, he was,

2614
02:41:14,910 --> 02:41:17,090
he was so mad. Well, some,

2615
02:41:17,091 --> 02:41:21,600
some comics do where their heart in
the sleeve as a lot of us that got into

2616
02:41:21,601 --> 02:41:25,670
comedy because we're fucked
up in the first place. That's
a big percentage. Yeah.

2617
02:41:26,340 --> 02:41:28,650
So I give them a Mulligan for the nineties

2618
02:41:31,930 --> 02:41:34,140
I really enjoyed having
him on the podcast too.

2619
02:41:34,141 --> 02:41:37,620
Although I still have not seen God bless
America. You see get prime. No, I haven't.

2620
02:41:37,770 --> 02:41:41,250
Which one? He just directed a new
movie. That's people you know,

2621
02:41:41,640 --> 02:41:45,750
almost unanimously praising.
Yeah. He's amazing.

2622
02:41:46,050 --> 02:41:49,860
He's a very talented guy. I gotta check
it out, but it seems kind of dark.

2623
02:41:50,640 --> 02:41:54,470
I don't want them to bump me out.
Isn't it funny how that is now?

2624
02:41:54,750 --> 02:41:59,450
Have you seen ted? No, I haven't
heard anything. Hurts me.

2625
02:41:59,460 --> 02:42:03,810
Go in there and going there
expecting to laugh. Yeah, I'm sure.

2626
02:42:03,870 --> 02:42:07,860
Good laps. Well, I love Seth
Macfarlane. He's got a great attitude.

2627
02:42:07,861 --> 02:42:11,700
I liked that dude. I like listening to
him when he does interviews. I like,

2628
02:42:11,790 --> 02:42:14,970
I like his attitude, you know? I
met him once, he was super nice.

2629
02:42:15,060 --> 02:42:18,200
And what's the guy? The
Star? Marky Mark Wahlberg.

2630
02:42:18,710 --> 02:42:21,260
Wahlberg really can act well.

2631
02:42:21,440 --> 02:42:25,890
It's getting a little bit too
anal for me though. Any weird?

2632
02:42:26,100 --> 02:42:29,010
He's getting weird. Yeah. Where with
you? I didn't know he was talking about,

2633
02:42:29,040 --> 02:42:29,873
you know,

2634
02:42:30,330 --> 02:42:35,330
he was doing the movie and
he memorizes all his lines.

2635
02:42:35,870 --> 02:42:38,610
He comes prepared. Right.
You know what I mean? Like,

2636
02:42:39,390 --> 02:42:43,850
so when was, what was the
context of him saying this? Well,

2637
02:42:43,950 --> 02:42:46,650
he had a lot of dialogue,
the name and girls

2638
02:42:49,160 --> 02:42:53,970
and he could rattle it off, right.
Problem. Whereas most actors, you know,

2639
02:42:54,120 --> 02:42:54,401
and,

2640
02:42:54,401 --> 02:42:59,040
and he nailed the people who ran and go
to work told me an awesome story this

2641
02:42:59,040 --> 02:43:02,730
past weekend about John Claude van Damme
and an ordinary, I wouldn't tell it,

2642
02:43:02,731 --> 02:43:05,350
but it just seems like this
one you can get away with rent,

2643
02:43:05,400 --> 02:43:07,220
especially if Randy Randy would say that,
uh,

2644
02:43:07,300 --> 02:43:10,860
John Claude would come into set after
partying all night. I forget his,

2645
02:43:11,650 --> 02:43:12,100
and it would hold

2646
02:43:12,100 --> 02:43:15,160
his hands up like this, like this,
like to tell them to give him his line.

2647
02:43:15,580 --> 02:43:20,410
Apparently still partying. John Claude
van Damme, still going at it hard.

2648
02:43:20,760 --> 02:43:25,720
You got to love it. You know, showing up.
This set just hammered. That's his line.

2649
02:43:26,150 --> 02:43:29,450
Talking about what like Walberg all of
a sudden he's turned into those super

2650
02:43:29,460 --> 02:43:33,610
professional, perfect guy.
It's evolving. I Dunno.

2651
02:43:34,060 --> 02:43:37,600
Happier this way. Maybe. I Dunno. I
haven't felt him. He liked him in things.

2652
02:43:37,630 --> 02:43:41,730
He did a really, really, really good
job. Yeah. But I think he can't wait.

2653
02:43:41,740 --> 02:43:44,970
He's getting a little bit too
[inaudible] need to get them high.

2654
02:43:44,971 --> 02:43:47,600
Is that what you're saying? You want
to, you want to get Marky mark. Hi.

2655
02:43:49,470 --> 02:43:51,280
He said like his kids,

2656
02:43:52,120 --> 02:43:54,910
he'll never take his kids to see this ted,
you know,

2657
02:43:55,610 --> 02:44:00,190
can really cause it's too
graphic. Potty mouth, right?

2658
02:44:01,160 --> 02:44:04,150
I Dunno.
Is he trying to change as a or something?

2659
02:44:04,180 --> 02:44:06,940
Maybe it's his wife and his wife's
real conservative. Who knows?

2660
02:44:06,941 --> 02:44:10,300
Maybe it's trying to change his image.
Maybe it's just a, he's a businessman.

2661
02:44:10,330 --> 02:44:14,190
It's making the pitch.
Oh whoa.

2662
02:44:14,710 --> 02:44:19,710
Tommy Chong just insinuated that
Mark Walberg May in fact be a bitch.

2663
02:44:20,261 --> 02:44:23,110
I can't believe you just went there.
We need to get you high again.

2664
02:44:23,140 --> 02:44:26,290
You got whatever you smoked
before the show wore off. I like,

2665
02:44:26,800 --> 02:44:30,360
I like Ted on the teddy bear. Yeah, great.

2666
02:44:30,400 --> 02:44:33,380
Moving into the sequel is going
to be even a better one because

2667
02:44:35,920 --> 02:44:37,050
I think the next one's just going to,

2668
02:44:37,380 --> 02:44:42,380
as long as you keep the same director
because I think they'll think they'll find

2669
02:44:42,611 --> 02:44:45,420
more weird things for the teddy
bear to do. Yeah, totally.

2670
02:44:45,500 --> 02:44:48,130
And I can't wait to see it.
I can't wait. This is good.

2671
02:44:48,131 --> 02:44:53,110
And I'm looking forward to that. Mila.
Mila Kunis. So beautiful. Dot. Huh?

2672
02:44:53,530 --> 02:44:56,980
Well, I worked with her for years.
70 show. Oh yeah, that's right.

2673
02:44:57,790 --> 02:45:02,290
What's it like doing that
show? A connection now? Did
join it. I really enjoyed it.

2674
02:45:02,690 --> 02:45:06,940
It was, did anybody on that show or try
to convert you into Scientology? Uh,

2675
02:45:06,941 --> 02:45:09,940
not really. No, not really. No. I mean,

2676
02:45:09,941 --> 02:45:13,870
they have some medical things
I was hacking and coughing.

2677
02:45:14,370 --> 02:45:16,930
Scientology helped you with
say no. No. Danny. Danny.

2678
02:45:16,931 --> 02:45:20,980
He got me into the vitamin C Drip Habib
or does that is Danny Scientologists.

2679
02:45:21,220 --> 02:45:24,380
Yeah. And so is the Laura
Prepon, right? Yeah.

2680
02:45:24,900 --> 02:45:28,360
It's interesting how many actors are
Scientologists, doesn't it? Well,

2681
02:45:28,410 --> 02:45:30,930
it's like acting school, you
know, when you think about it,

2682
02:45:32,100 --> 02:45:36,110
it's the ultimate acting school. They
teach you how to act in public. Really.

2683
02:45:36,160 --> 02:45:39,810
Is that what it is and how to control
people. That's why the steer it.

2684
02:45:39,811 --> 02:45:44,020
But did you ever get involved in a little
bit on the type of teaching that we

2685
02:45:44,021 --> 02:45:48,430
had this, we had a series of managers
when we were coming up trying to make it,

2686
02:45:49,960 --> 02:45:50,710
this one guy,

2687
02:45:50,710 --> 02:45:54,820
we didn't know he was a Scientology until
he got us booked in this club or this

2688
02:45:55,240 --> 02:45:56,980
call in Hollywood

2689
02:45:59,290 --> 02:46:02,060
before we'd go on stage every time
she should have to go take a dump.

2690
02:46:03,120 --> 02:46:07,110
Teach comes back and he goes, this
is a weird place man. You know,

2691
02:46:07,400 --> 02:46:09,800
they got written on the walls there.
I

2692
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:14,150
struggle was thrown into the
mail stream of the universe

2693
02:46:15,650 --> 02:46:17,750
instead of here. I sit
brokenhearted, right.

2694
02:46:18,050 --> 02:46:22,370
It's the mail stream of the universe and
all the Scientology bullshit. Bullshit.

2695
02:46:22,460 --> 02:46:27,200
Wow. While you're taking a dump. And
so, so we went on stage, you know, and,

2696
02:46:27,360 --> 02:46:31,370
and they're all staring at these stair,
they stare, they just stare into it.

2697
02:46:31,880 --> 02:46:35,530
And the Stepford wives, right.
They Kinda, they Kinda, I use,

2698
02:46:35,540 --> 02:46:37,730
I like to show or we worked
through a couple of times.

2699
02:46:40,450 --> 02:46:42,620
Wow. It was fun. Well listen man,

2700
02:46:42,621 --> 02:46:45,860
you gotta let us know when
the animated movie comes out.

2701
02:46:45,861 --> 02:46:47,120
So it will tweet the shit out of it.

2702
02:46:47,150 --> 02:46:51,460
[inaudible] us know when
your podcast comes out, so
it's going to call a podcast.

2703
02:46:51,470 --> 02:46:55,160
That's what your podcast,
you know there was already a podcast,

2704
02:46:55,830 --> 02:47:00,330
a podcast, but it doesn't matter. Right? I
used to be doing, there's always they do.

2705
02:47:00,410 --> 02:47:04,340
Yeah, he's still podcasts and just just
smoke. It wasn't what it was called.

2706
02:47:05,300 --> 02:47:06,680
It was called a podcast,
but a,

2707
02:47:06,750 --> 02:47:09,770
the girl I did it with was an actress
and she's like, you know what?

2708
02:47:09,771 --> 02:47:13,700
I need to say, probably,
maybe name it something else.

2709
02:47:13,701 --> 02:47:17,390
We call it a pop cast.
This is ruining my image,

2710
02:47:18,050 --> 02:47:21,980
being connected with something awesome
and I'm not comfortable with that.

2711
02:47:22,260 --> 02:47:26,300
It may limit me from lying
and bullshitting, which
I know some of them not.

2712
02:47:26,740 --> 02:47:28,760
Maybe makes them nervous. Listen, man,

2713
02:47:28,790 --> 02:47:31,850
you've been a hero to the marijuana
movement and the comedy movement and

2714
02:47:31,851 --> 02:47:35,240
everything for fucking decades. Man,
it's an honor to do a podcast with you.

2715
02:47:35,270 --> 02:47:39,080
When I was a little kid, listen to
those albums at my parents' house.

2716
02:47:39,081 --> 02:47:41,170
I had never would have imagined
that we'd be able to do this.

2717
02:47:41,171 --> 02:47:45,070
So thank you very much for doing this.
Did they tell you I got cancer? Yeah,

2718
02:47:45,080 --> 02:47:49,000
you did it. We went over there.
That's my new thing to ride on. No,

2719
02:47:50,780 --> 02:47:53,360
I'm going to write down your hook.
I'm going to write down cancer hooks.

2720
02:47:53,361 --> 02:47:56,510
A good hook. Yeah, it is. It ain't. I
love you how they can. Then I got to go.

2721
02:47:56,511 --> 02:48:01,380
See the guys might be going, so
you're going to be around for a while.

2722
02:48:02,450 --> 02:48:06,440
Eat unhealthy. Apparently. If I get the
right finger up my butt, I'll be okay.

2723
02:48:06,770 --> 02:48:09,710
I think we got that. If you need
help, Brian is a magic finger.

2724
02:48:10,250 --> 02:48:14,630
Show me magic fingerprint.
It shows over a creepy ending.

2725
02:48:14,990 --> 02:48:16,090
Thank you to a on it,

2726
02:48:16,740 --> 02:48:19,020
O, n n I t, makers of Alpha brain,

2727
02:48:19,021 --> 02:48:24,021
and now the new whole sport's fitness
aspect to it we have in the company and

2728
02:48:24,511 --> 02:48:28,080
