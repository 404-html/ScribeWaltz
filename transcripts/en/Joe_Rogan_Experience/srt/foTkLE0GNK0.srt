1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:03,930
Five,
four,

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,430
three,
two,

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,413
one.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,610
Well,
I'll start.

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:12,660
Hello,
ladies and gentlemen.

6
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:13,800
Hello.
Dr. McGee.

7
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,300
That sounds not me pitching.
If you're hearing that,

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,290
you're like,
what is this?

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,870
Is this a podcast and a bathroom?
No,

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,970
that's coffee.
How are you buddy?

11
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,040
Good.
Thank you for having me.

12
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,330
Thanks for being here.
For folks who have heard me a rant and

13
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:33,150
rave about the fantastic results that
I've had,

14
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,690
I'm getting treatment on my shoulder
where I was that close to getting

15
00:00:36,691 --> 00:00:38,400
surgery.
It's this gentleman,

16
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,060
Dr Mcphee,
who has a fixed me up out of Las Vegas,

17
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:44,220
Nevada.
And uh,

18
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,750
now we're here to talk about it.
Yeah,

19
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,190
no,
I appreciate the chance to be here.

20
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,660
What do you have,
man?

21
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:51,480
A very short words today.
He was very talkative before the podcast

22
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:52,920
folks.
That's how it goes.

23
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:54,560
But now I'm hearing myself and that was
it.

24
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:55,530
Weird you out?
Yeah,

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,190
you take them off.

26
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,250
We can take them off as too weird.
He'd never done a podcast like this for

27
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,210
you.
Did John Dudley's.

28
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,650
Yeah.
Is Excellent.

29
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,020
We can take it off.
I might have to.

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,980
Okay,
let's take it off.

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,710
I don't want to freak you out.
Yeah.

32
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,280
Is that better?
This is a little more like a normal

33
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:10,170
conversation.
I don't want to freak you out.

34
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,880
To me it's better cause like I can hear
like if it's things are wrong,

35
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,320
what's a,
what's the notes Daddy?

36
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,170
Oh,
what do you got there?

37
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,760
Uh,
just a couple of things I jotted down.

38
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:21,000
Just make sure a gift you all the
information you want to hear.

39
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,770
Well,
I just want to tell you that I feel

40
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:26,880
super fortunate to have met you and to
have been treated by you and to be able

41
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:28,950
to have these conversations with you and
your office,

42
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,190
which is why I wanted to have you here
to talk to you because I mean,

43
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:35,760
I was having some really significant
shoulder issues before.

44
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,790
Um,
you treated it and it's,

45
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:41,190
it's amazing the results and what,
what,

46
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,421
you know,
I mean,

47
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:44,550
what,
what I've avoided,

48
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,420
avoided in shoulder surgery.
Yeah.

49
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,650
I mean you've had a tremendous result.
So,

50
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,450
uh,
obviously we're very thankful that

51
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,490
you're able to get that benefit.
And I think we're in my community of

52
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,100
Orthopedic Surgery and sports medicine.
You know,

53
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:03,600
we're very excited about the possibility
and eager to continue to learn about it

54
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:07,170
and see what it can be and how it can
help and what it does best for.

55
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:09,450
What now?
Where's all this stuff coming from?

56
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:11,820
Like winter?
Where is this science coming from and

57
00:02:11,821 --> 00:02:13,710
how has it evolved over the last few
years?

58
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,270
Well,
um,

59
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,890
a lot of the stuff that we're using is
not new in terms of,

60
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,460
uh,
the tissue or a,

61
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,780
that type of thing.
But it's actually that the application

62
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:28,830
for Orthopedic Sports Medicine,
so you could go back decades to when

63
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,410
it's been used in plastic surgery,
uh,

64
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:35,250
for corneal ulcers is one of the
original applications of placental

65
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:39,810
tissue.
So the idea of it isn't necessarily new,

66
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:45,050
it's just that as we've gained more
understanding in our community of

67
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,380
orthopedic surgery,
now we're starting to see what the

68
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:51,360
applications can be.
Now,

69
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:53,700
when you say plastic surgery,
like what have they done with it?

70
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:55,980
With plastic surgery,
mostly helping with wounds,

71
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,710
complication,
wound healing,

72
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,070
and the potential

73
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,530
for there to be wound healing without
scarring.

74
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,170
So that's one of the things that we'll
get into.

75
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,660
How do they do that?
Um,

76
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,890
it's part of the mechanism of how the
cell helps the process of the healing.

77
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,050
So,
but we'll talk about that for sure.

78
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,900
Now when they extract the placental
tissue,

79
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,190
like how are they,
they're,

80
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:21,340
they're doing it on young women who have
had [inaudible] sections,

81
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:23,650
crusher.
So bypasses a lot of the ethical

82
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:26,020
concerns that a lot of people had during
the Bush administration,

83
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,340
which kept them.
Okay.

84
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:29,890
So let's,
you said a couple of different important

85
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:31,570
things,
so let's start breaking that down a

86
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:33,700
little bit.
So the first thing is,

87
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,200
um,
you know,

88
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:37,030
where does it come from?
It comes from a young,

89
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:38,350
healthy mother.
In this case,

90
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,710
what we're talking about,
um,

91
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,060
this particular category of biologic
treatment or cellular tissue,

92
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,040
uh,
this comes from a young healthy mother

93
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:53,041
that's having elective c section and
prior to the delivery has agreed to make

94
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:55,930
a charitable donation.

95
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:01,390
And then they have been screened and
there's a process that must be followed

96
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:03,610
by the American Association of Tissue
Banks.

97
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:07,360
And they have a series of blood tests
that they have to go through.

98
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,390
And so you're checking to be sure that
there's no communicable disease,

99
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,590
you know,
for example,

100
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:13,690
hepatitis or HIV,
uh,

101
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,710
things of that nature.
And so once that has been cleared and

102
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:21,280
they're an acceptable donor,
then they go through the delivery,

103
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,560
the tissues collected.
And as you said,

104
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,260
this is stuff that typically would go in
the garbage.

105
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:27,590
So,
um,

106
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,620
essentially the,
you know,

107
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:34,621
the ethical and the moral dilemma
shouldn't exist for that portion of it

108
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:39,721
because otherwise it's just garbage.
Now that's taken by the company that has

109
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,700
harvested and they have their processing
center,

110
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:47,940
which also has to be,
uh,

111
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:53,260
evaluated and approved by this aatp
American Association of Tissue Banks,

112
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,890
uh,
to be a facility that is up to their

113
00:04:56,891 --> 00:04:57,430
standards.

114
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,450
So they have a sterilization process.
The tissue's not contaminated.

115
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:03,550
Their packaging is appropriate that are,
you know,

116
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:05,800
their shipping's not causing problems
with the tissue.

117
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:08,170
So you have to meet all these standards
is very stringent.

118
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,020
And so if you have that,
if a company has that,

119
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,820
uh,
approval,

120
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:13,970
then you know,
they,

121
00:05:13,971 --> 00:05:18,850
they meet the standards allowed so that
that stuff can then go either to an

122
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:23,350
office or to a hospital.
So now the,

123
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,230
the next thing of what you said,
um,

124
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:29,150
let's talk a little bit about,
uh,

125
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,890
uh,
President Bush and that whole

126
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,050
discussion.
So first of all,

127
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:38,140
that is about embryonic stem cells.
Okay.

128
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,300
An embryonic stem cell,
and that's,

129
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,520
you know,
that doesn't have anything to do with

130
00:05:42,521 --> 00:05:43,980
what we're doing.
Um,

131
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:49,050
an embryonic stem cell is when the sperm
and the egg join and begin to form the

132
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:53,380
beginning sells a life and there's
initially two cells and then it divides

133
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:54,460
into four,
eight,

134
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:58,070
et cetera.
In the f the first five days of life,

135
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:02,600
that's called a blastocyst.
And those cells can be harvested,

136
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,590
um,
and they are what we call toady potent.

137
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,850
That means they can become anything.
They have the ability to transform into

138
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:15,851
any line of tissue or Oregon,
or in the case of that first five days

139
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:20,420
of life,
those individual cells can actually

140
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,270
become a complete organism.
So that's,

141
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,060
that's where we have,
you know,

142
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,800
the cloning of the sheep.
So that's what happens.

143
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:29,990
So they,
they took the cells in that first couple

144
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:34,010
of days and then they divide process to
allow it to continue to grow.

145
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:36,350
And,
and so you had two different,

146
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,360
from a single sperm and egg,
you had two organisms,

147
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,310
complete mammals,
you know,

148
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:45,880
created.
So when you say this blastocyst,

149
00:06:45,881 --> 00:06:48,320
is that how you say it?
That's just the term for the initial,

150
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,810
you know,
the ball of cells that's formed.

151
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:53,090
And how many cells is in a blastocyst?

152
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,160
Well,
they're dividing over the number of days

153
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:58,340
in doubling each time.
So then thousands,

154
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,780
not by that time.
No.

155
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,460
Hundreds.
You're 16,

156
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,540
you know,
32.

157
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,060
So if you have 32,
how many different organisms can you

158
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:07,910
make off of those 32 cells?
Technically,

159
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:11,300
if you have a toadie potent cell,
every individual cell has the ability to

160
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:12,980
become a complete organism.
Whoa.

161
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,700
So that could be one.
Blastocyst could be 32 different people,

162
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,690
I guess.
Potentially.

163
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,390
Wow.
I don't know if that experiment's been

164
00:07:20,391 --> 00:07:22,920
carried out,
but theoretically at least.

165
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,410
Wow.
So,

166
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,960
um,
now when they have like frozen embryos,

167
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:30,770
when people do things like that,
when they decide they want to have kids

168
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:33,200
later in life and they freeze their
embryos,

169
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,790
how the hell are they doing that?
What's,

170
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,430
what's that about?
And I'm not like a reproduction

171
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,460
specialists so we might be getting,
you know Adam,

172
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,100
but it's frozen embryos.

173
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,970
A lot of times they don't get used.
Right.

174
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,730
I don't know.
I don't know how that works.

175
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,110
Um,
cause I know there's been battles,

176
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,760
like people have had battles with their
wives and stuff.

177
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,630
That's very much the,
my understanding of it would be that if

178
00:07:56,631 --> 00:07:57,441
you're,
you know,

179
00:07:57,441 --> 00:08:01,670
you're freezing it with the intention of
maintaining the cell viability and so

180
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:05,510
somebody has demonstrated that you could
then thaw that sal and it still has the

181
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:08,300
opportunity to divide,
produce and you know,

182
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:09,890
become a living thing.
Wow.

183
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,480
I was thinking like for the non-viable
ones or the ones that don't get turned

184
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:17,120
into people,
they could probably use those as well.

185
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,650
Right.
Well that,

186
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,810
that's a big,
that was the thing,

187
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:22,730
right?
That was the big George Bush thing.

188
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,481
Well.
Okay,

189
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:26,690
so let's back up on that because I think
there's a lot of misconception about

190
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:30,140
that.
And I hear like very strange comments

191
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:34,730
made about it all the time in the media.
So the thing that George Bush signed in

192
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:39,731
2001 stated that the federal government
was not going to supply money for

193
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:42,740
embryonic stem cell research.
That's it.

194
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,290
It was not a ban on the APP,
on nation,

195
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,090
on stem cell research.
So for all of that time,

196
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:54,980
I mean private equity companies in any
private investor could have and probably

197
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,370
been spending the money

198
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,570
to continue to research that and develop
it and find it.

199
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:03,570
So I always find it interesting when I
hear on TV,

200
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,240
oh,
like the,

201
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:08,730
our country has been set back a decade
because they signed to this,

202
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:09,470
you know,
Bill.

203
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,680
I'm like,
so you feel that's wrong?

204
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,180
Yeah,
that's so,

205
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:13,830
um,
but all he said was,

206
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:15,900
we're not going to dedicate federal
money to it.

207
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,080
Right.
That's different than a ban on any

208
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,330
study.
But how much research does rely on

209
00:09:21,331 --> 00:09:23,220
federal funding?
And I don't know.

210
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,210
I mean there's,
there's private funding for all kinds of

211
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:29,210
things.
So is it more common now than it is

212
00:09:29,211 --> 00:09:32,430
before or is it always been the case
where there's a lot of private funding?

213
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:36,570
So President Obama in 2009 lifted the
ban on the federal funding.

214
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:38,880
So federal fundings been going on for it
since,

215
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,440
since then.
Interesting.

216
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,440
Yeah.
So what is the difference in terms of

217
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:47,730
the viability of placental stem cells
that you would get from a woman in

218
00:09:47,731 --> 00:09:51,390
necessary and section versus something
that you would get from a blastocyst?

219
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,170
Well,
so a couple of things about that.

220
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,530
Um,
one there's,

221
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,000
um,
it's actually to our benefit in

222
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:08,001
orthopedics not to be using that line of
cells because those cells starting from

223
00:10:09,121 --> 00:10:14,121
that time point have the ability to have
teratogenic potential.

224
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,540
So what that means is they can
potentially form tumors.

225
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,980
So that makes it obviously a big
disadvantage because now we're,

226
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:26,130
we're adding our risk to what we're
doing once they've gotten to the point

227
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:29,190
where it's a part of the,
the whole,

228
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,760
you know,
we call this like a human placental stem

229
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:36,330
cells or Mesenchymal stem cell.
And that includes the placenta,

230
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,370
the umbilical cord,
the Wharton's Jelly is a mucus type

231
00:10:41,371 --> 00:10:43,170
substance.
It's around the arteries of the

232
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:46,590
umbilical cord,
the amnion or the amniotic sac,

233
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:49,410
which is the inner layer around the the
baby.

234
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,200
And then the outer layer is called the
cory on.

235
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:57,830
Now all of that has cells in it that we
would put in the category of Ms Inca,

236
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,870
most stem cells or Mesenchymal stem
cell.

237
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,560
And what that means is they have a
specific line of tissues that they can

238
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:12,750
become.
So now back to when I was explaining the

239
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,890
formation of the blastocyst becomes a
Morella becomes,

240
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:18,630
uh,
an embryo eventually.

241
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,510
So in that process,
uh,

242
00:11:21,511 --> 00:11:26,511
you have this ball of tissue and then it
starts to kind of fold in on itself.

243
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:30,120
And then it starts to layer out into
these three layers.

244
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:31,740
You have endoderm,
ectoderm,

245
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,960
mesoderm,
the,

246
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,540
um,
each of those kinds of is directed

247
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,880
towards a certain line of cells and
tissues.

248
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,460
The misa Durham,
and what these,

249
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,860
uh,
the Mesenchymal stem cells can become,

250
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:47,030
are all of the things that we care about
in orthopedics.

251
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:48,270
So cartilage,
bone,

252
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,170
muscle,
ligament,

253
00:11:49,171 --> 00:11:52,620
tendon.
So we have that whole line of cells,

254
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,380
um,
that this particular sale has the

255
00:11:56,381 --> 00:12:01,381
potential to become.
So when we talk about a stem cell,

256
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,830
the by definition,
what it means is one,

257
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:09,910
it can divide and become another stem
cell so it can,

258
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:14,500
it can duplicate itself so that now you
have another cell that can divide and

259
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:19,501
become another cell or it can divide and
differentiate into a cell that then has

260
00:12:21,881 --> 00:12:25,420
the characteristics of the things that
you're hoping it will become.

261
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,550
Now that's a,
uh,

262
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,040
directed in ordered approach in
embryology.

263
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,100
And in the case of,
uh,

264
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,310
treating an injury,
what we're hoping is that that can

265
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,760
differentiate into the injured tissue.
And how long have they been doing that

266
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,470
while studies on that have been going on
for at least 10 years.

267
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,730
So I want to say maybe back as early as
2007.

268
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,220
Um,
now we've been,

269
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:59,550
if you go in a way back to the early
days of a arthroscopy,

270
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,850
and now it'd be like the late seventies
and early 1980s,

271
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,450
uh,
and I don't know exactly what year,

272
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,610
you know,
he would have started doing this,

273
00:13:09,611 --> 00:13:10,930
but,
um,

274
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,090
doctor steadman at,
uh,

275
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:16,510
in Vail,
Colorado and he was in Reno and Lake

276
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,510
Tahoe area before that.
They would,

277
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,920
um,
this,

278
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,470
he's the one that developed the
microfracture procedure.

279
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,790
I don't know if you're familiar with
that.

280
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,120
You've had a couple of knee surgery,
so I don't know if you've heard that

281
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:29,050
term,
but I have,

282
00:13:29,051 --> 00:13:31,270
but I don't really recall exactly what
it is.

283
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,870
Sure.
So basically if a patient had a small

284
00:13:34,871 --> 00:13:37,450
cartilage defect,
he took a small,

285
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,300
uh,
an all or like what looked like a tiny

286
00:13:40,301 --> 00:13:43,300
little pick and made a puncture into the
bone.

287
00:13:43,301 --> 00:13:46,810
And what that did is it releases marrow
elements along with blood.

288
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,160
And they were able to see with time,
and you know,

289
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:55,420
there were occasions when they got to
have second look arthroscopy that that

290
00:13:55,421 --> 00:14:00,310
cartilage could fill in.
Now they also found that that didn't

291
00:14:00,311 --> 00:14:04,180
become the native cartilage.
It becomes something called fibro

292
00:14:04,181 --> 00:14:05,800
cartilage.
So when you look at it under a

293
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:07,660
microscope,
it looks different compared to our

294
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:08,920
normal cartilage.
Hmm.

295
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,440
Appearance like physically looks the
same,

296
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,880
but under the microscope looks
different.

297
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,660
What is the difference?
Uh,

298
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,620
well,
the main difference in,

299
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:20,290
in what's applicable is that,
um,

300
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,610
it's doesn't have the same structural
properties.

301
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:29,380
So it was more easily able to kind of
come off with a sheer force.

302
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,210
So just picture like you were bending.
Yeah.

303
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,770
You could kind of flake off or,
or in some cases just didn't form as

304
00:14:35,771 --> 00:14:37,780
well as you know,
you would want.

305
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,850
Hmm.
So,

306
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,250
so that experience,
um,

307
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:42,911
and I,
you know,

308
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:45,400
having conversations with the guy that I
trained with,

309
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:50,401
his name's Larry Lemak in Birmingham.
He noted just over his career that he

310
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,780
always felt like patients that had worse
arthritis,

311
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,800
but they would do this microfracture
procedure on in knee arthroscopy

312
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,400
actually would do better than patients
with less arthritis,

313
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:05,720
but that they didn't do the procedure.
And so it had always been in his mind

314
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:08,300
that,
that somehow that marrow stimulation

315
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:10,730
was,
was providing something that was helping

316
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:13,100
with either healing or pain relief.
Um,

317
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,260
and,
and it's only now that we start to

318
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:16,460
understand,
you know,

319
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,200
because the bone marrow has some of
these mesenchymal stem cells available

320
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:22,034
also.

321
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,200
And we'll kind of talk about the
differences and stuff like that.

322
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:28,310
So it was essentially like a crude
version of some stem cell transplants,

323
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:29,600
like,
yeah,

324
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,240
I think that's a good way to put it.
Yeah.

325
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,890
I mean,
our hope is that we're,

326
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,450
we're using cells that can again,
change into other things that we want.

327
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,720
And when did they start applying this on
people?

328
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,270
Like in terms of not just tests and
studies,

329
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:46,460
but actually in practice,
like what you do?

330
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,930
Uh,
well,

331
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,990
in Orthopedic Sports Medicine,
I don't think I started to hear about it

332
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:55,460
until around 2012.
So that was the first year that I was in

333
00:15:55,461 --> 00:16:00,461
practice and I attended a conference in
Las Vegas and it was called the emerging

334
00:16:01,611 --> 00:16:04,580
techniques in orthopedics.
So they were kind of talking about

335
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:06,800
what's the,
the newest and uh,

336
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:10,970
you know,
most forward thinking ideas that are

337
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:15,620
coming through.
So a company presented and one of the

338
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:21,250
physicians presented information showing
that they had harvested fat tissue from

339
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:25,010
patients abdomens and injected into
their knee,

340
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,510
um,
for patients that had knee arthritis and

341
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:33,770
they were showing new growth of
cartilage and,

342
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:36,830
and actually improvement in some of the
x rays.

343
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,460
So when you look at an x ray,
there's some characteristics that we

344
00:16:40,461 --> 00:16:41,780
look at that,
you know,

345
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,930
define what arthritises.
So if the patient has narrowing of the

346
00:16:44,931 --> 00:16:47,120
joint space or they have bone spurs,
things like that,

347
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,420
um,
they were actually seeing more space

348
00:16:50,421 --> 00:16:52,460
between the bones and some of these
serial x rays.

349
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:53,490
So,
you know,

350
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:58,510
I saw that and that was just like so
incredible and something that I'd never

351
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,220
heard about,
read about or you know,

352
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:04,220
had encountered before.
And that's really what kind of sparked

353
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:06,320
my interest.
And what are they doing with the fat?

354
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,960
Cause I've,
I've heard that they do stem cells,

355
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,430
the virtual,
like a,

356
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,060
like a mini liposuction,
right.

357
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,540
And then they're,
you know,

358
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:17,000
they either spin it in a centrifuge or
there's a,

359
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,440
there,
you know,

360
00:17:18,441 --> 00:17:22,700
these syringes that you can pass it
through a filter and then you reinject

361
00:17:22,701 --> 00:17:23,130
it.
And,

362
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,980
and what you're trying to do is,
is again,

363
00:17:24,981 --> 00:17:28,880
take advantage of the fact that there's
these mesenchymal stem cells in the

364
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:33,881
tissue and like what can they just,
are they just taking the fat,

365
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,440
like when they spin it in a centrifuge,
like what does that accomplish?

366
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,220
Uh,
just separates out the,

367
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,530
the cells.
So then you can inject the portion that

368
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:44,480
you want.
And we do that.

369
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,400
Usually I've had it with PRP.
Yeah,

370
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,293
yeah,
yeah.

371
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,950
So just I've,
I've had with Regina King,

372
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,090
which is like a form,
right?

373
00:17:51,091 --> 00:17:52,020
PRP,
correct.

374
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,870
Yeah.
With a heated up and becomes like a

375
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:56,310
yellow serum.
Right?

376
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,650
So when their platelet layer of the
blood and you're looking at,

377
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:00,743
okay.
Yeah.

378
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,660
And so the,
the red cells separate out and you can,

379
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,840
you can easily see that in the tube.
And what is the difference in the

380
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:10,310
results from someone who does that?
Because I know quite a few people who've

381
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,750
done it that way.
They've had injuries treated where they

382
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:14,910
suck the fat out.
There isn't any,

383
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,000
uh,
any research to differentiate like one

384
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:20,520
of these treatments versus another yet
it's just not available.

385
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:23,810
So it's all anecdotal in terms of like
talking to patients.

386
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:24,601
It's happening.
I mean,

387
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:26,970
people are collecting the data,
but it's just not,

388
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,940
you know,
it's not at the mature stage where,

389
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,590
um,
you know,

390
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:36,591
where it's available and we have
published stuff to look at and

391
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,680
personally know of anybody who's had
really good results using the fat

392
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,523
method.

393
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,850
Um,
yes,

394
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:43,080
actually,
uh,

395
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,710
a physician friend of mine in Memphis,
Tennessee,

396
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,540
her name's doctor Laura Lenderman.
Um,

397
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,560
she has utilized that quite a bit and
she's been very happy with the patients

398
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:56,910
that she's treated in.
Naturally.

399
00:18:56,911 --> 00:18:59,580
Some people do better than others,
but you know,

400
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,140
the,
the real,

401
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,960
the rigorous study of this though is
still yet to come.

402
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,730
It's really fascinating.
Like d have you considered trying that

403
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,260
or you just definitely,
yeah.

404
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:13,500
But you don't so far you just do the
stem cells haven't had anybody

405
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:16,140
specifically request it and,
uh,

406
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,630
maybe somebody wants to lose a little
fat and fix her knees.

407
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,280
Yeah,
I mean that's,

408
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,730
that's probably taking things in a
direction I don't want to be going.

409
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:28,731
But by plastic surgery are,
we know there are a number of different

410
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,910
options in terms of where these sources
of the cells can come from.

411
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:36,900
Um,
bone marrow is certainly had a lot of

412
00:19:36,901 --> 00:19:39,000
use and Daniel Qca had that done.

413
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,170
That's what he told me.
Yeah.

414
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:43,290
He had a pulled out of his hip and he
said it was brutally painful then he was

415
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,780
walking with a limp for like two weeks.
It's a,

416
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,330
obviously it's a procedure.
Um,

417
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,900
there's pain and there's,
you know,

418
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,840
morbidity.
There's a consequence to,

419
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,440
you know,
putting a sharp object into the bone and

420
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:57,170
drying them.
Yeah.

421
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,063
So that means,
uh,

422
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,320
a bad thing.
I don't like that word now.

423
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,290
It's,
we don't like it either.

424
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,320
In medicine,
more bid is a bad word.

425
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:08,640
We have conferences called Morbidity and
mortality and that's where you basically

426
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,660
own up to things that you've done a
terrible job with or explain,

427
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:15,330
you know,
why somebody has died as a result of

428
00:20:15,331 --> 00:20:20,190
your care.
And it's a awful thing to go through and

429
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:24,360
it's critically important to be able to
evaluate yourself and understand what

430
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:26,430
things happen when they don't go the way
that we want them to.

431
00:20:26,431 --> 00:20:31,431
So it's an important exercise that
physicians go through to review cases.

432
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,150
So I can only imagine.
Yeah,

433
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,070
I mean,
especially if you're dealing with people

434
00:20:35,071 --> 00:20:36,630
that are broken apart.
I mean,

435
00:20:36,631 --> 00:20:39,150
essentially as an orthopedic surgeon,
you're dealing with,

436
00:20:39,151 --> 00:20:41,070
people's bodies have failed,
right?

437
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,030
Your limbs have failed,
ligaments have torn off the bone,

438
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,740
and these have exploded.
I mean,

439
00:20:47,741 --> 00:20:48,130
you've

440
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,030
told me some gnarly stuff in terms of
the kind of injuries that you've had to

441
00:20:51,031 --> 00:20:53,940
treat,
and I could only imagine some of bad

442
00:20:53,941 --> 00:20:54,620
things.
Yeah,

443
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,453
yeah,
yeah.

444
00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:00,490
And so your time doing this with
placental stem cells,

445
00:21:00,491 --> 00:21:02,120
how long have you been doing that?
Uh,

446
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:07,170
it's been a couple of years.
So essentially you did mine,

447
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:09,120
I think.
How long ago was it?

448
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:13,360
I think it was July of 2015 yeah.
So I kind of came in pretty,

449
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:16,660
pretty early because Jeff Davidson to
doctor from the UFC,

450
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:21,580
he was the one who told me about it
because he had shoulder surgery and um,

451
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,200
he was very stiff and had real problems
after the shoulder surgery and was,

452
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:29,980
I'm just very unhappy with his range of
motion and the pain that is

453
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:31,540
experiencing.
And then he got some stem cell

454
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,360
treatments and it just all went away.
Then he trains a lot.

455
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,150
Yeah.
Trains really hard and he's very fit,

456
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,850
pretty impressed with,
uh,

457
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,910
you know what he told me about how he
was,

458
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,460
what he was able to get back to you
after,

459
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,650
you know,
he had been treated with,

460
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,150
uh,
that type of injection.

461
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,210
Yeah,
yeah,

462
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,240
yeah.
So he told me and then I was like on the

463
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:52,811
fence.
I mean,

464
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:56,020
I'd seen an orthopedic surgeon and the
only thing that was keeping me from

465
00:21:56,021 --> 00:21:57,160
getting surgery is,
you know,

466
00:21:57,161 --> 00:21:58,420
he put me through all these,
um,

467
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:03,220
stress tests where he pushed down on my
arm and all this time and I resisted all

468
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:03,791
of them.
And he's like,

469
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,590
this is,
it's kind of odd,

470
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,380
but your injuries this bad,
but you have so much strength in your

471
00:22:08,381 --> 00:22:09,350
joints still.
Yeah.

472
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,490
Like maybe you should hold off a little
bit before you get the surgery.

473
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,230
He's like,

474
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:16,890
cause I thought that when I examined you
two because I really couldn't reproduce

475
00:22:16,891 --> 00:22:18,600
your pain.
Yeah.

476
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,200
So and that,
and that's,

477
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,200
that's another reason and then I
probably would have been in the same

478
00:22:25,201 --> 00:22:28,380
boat as the first guy in terms of uh,
you know,

479
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:31,260
trying to make a decision about surgery.
Um,

480
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,140
because you know,
if your physical exam doesn't,

481
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,570
you know,
show that somebody has some significant

482
00:22:36,571 --> 00:22:37,440
deficits,
it's,

483
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,810
it's hard to make the jump to take
somebody to surgery.

484
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,150
Well,
during normal,

485
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:44,130
everyday life there'd be like zero pain.
Right.

486
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:48,140
Problem is what I put my body through.
His has nothing that resembles normal

487
00:22:48,141 --> 00:22:51,590
everyday life,
Jujitsu and kickboxing and kettle bells

488
00:22:51,591 --> 00:22:56,591
and archery and yeah,
there's just so much explosive movements

489
00:22:56,991 --> 00:23:00,740
and so much weight bearing movements and
doing really high demand stuff.

490
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,150
Yeah.
So in that,

491
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,830
in that case,
that was one of the reasons why I was

492
00:23:03,831 --> 00:23:05,180
thinking,
cause like I don't want to walk around

493
00:23:05,181 --> 00:23:06,890
with a compromised body.
I'm like,

494
00:23:06,891 --> 00:23:11,150
if I have to just get surgery and then
take six months of Rehab or whatever it

495
00:23:11,151 --> 00:23:12,050
was like,
what is the,

496
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,510
for a type of shoulder injury that I
had,

497
00:23:14,511 --> 00:23:15,980
what is the rehabilitation time?

498
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,740
Um,
you know,

499
00:23:18,741 --> 00:23:22,130
for sure probably three months.
I mean,

500
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,610
it,
it can be longer than that.

501
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:26,120
It depends on the patient.
Um,

502
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,270
somebody like you that in one of the
things that we,

503
00:23:29,271 --> 00:23:32,090
uh,
have trouble with,

504
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:35,180
with some patients,
they've never even lifted weights for

505
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:36,110
example.
Oh yeah.

506
00:23:36,111 --> 00:23:37,760
So for them,
the Rehab,

507
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:42,050
recovery and rehab,
we're introducing things to them that

508
00:23:42,051 --> 00:23:43,700
they've never seen or done.
Right.

509
00:23:43,701 --> 00:23:45,170
And they don't understand the
difference,

510
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,750
you know,
being sore and in pain.

511
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:50,300
That's,
that they should be conscious about.

512
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,030
Um,
it's challenging,

513
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:56,390
it's hard work and it's uncomfortable.
And so some patients,

514
00:23:56,391 --> 00:23:58,370
you know,
they struggle to get through that part

515
00:23:58,371 --> 00:23:59,540
of it,
um,

516
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,850
in a naturally will take longer to
improve.

517
00:24:01,851 --> 00:24:03,890
So it's harder for them to get their
motion.

518
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,500
It's longer,
much longer for them to return their

519
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:08,720
strength.
Now you already have like a significant

520
00:24:08,721 --> 00:24:13,520
baseline level of strength,
so much easier in your case to bounce

521
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:15,770
back.
And then also the things that you would

522
00:24:15,771 --> 00:24:18,130
do in rehab there are so rudimentary,
you know,

523
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,760
you would move through that very
quickly.

524
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,100
And then,
uh,

525
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:26,600
once you're at the point where you have
had enough tissue healing and it's safe

526
00:24:26,601 --> 00:24:27,590
to progress,
you,

527
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,091
um,
you know,

528
00:24:29,091 --> 00:24:31,910
through higher level exercises,
then you could really push it and you

529
00:24:31,911 --> 00:24:32,691
would,
I mean,

530
00:24:32,691 --> 00:24:35,210
you would be committed to it.
Dedicated,

531
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,340
diligent.
I mean we'd almost have to hold you

532
00:24:37,341 --> 00:24:38,420
back.
Yeah,

533
00:24:38,421 --> 00:24:38,880
that was another

534
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,600
question that I had.
How often do you have people where that

535
00:24:41,601 --> 00:24:42,530
is the,
the issue?

536
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:45,560
Like I know you,
you've treated a bunch of fighters and

537
00:24:45,561 --> 00:24:48,080
when you treat mma fighters,
is that an issue where you're trying to

538
00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:49,610
like slow them down?
Go

539
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,610
all the time.
You got to let people know,

540
00:24:51,611 --> 00:24:52,900
like,
and one of my,

541
00:24:52,901 --> 00:24:54,210
uh,
you know,

542
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,470
one of the lines that I'd say to all my
patients,

543
00:24:56,550 --> 00:25:00,130
um,
regularly is you got to respect biology.

544
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,140
Like you have to allow the healing to
happen.

545
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,960
I know you feel good.
I know you're moving good and you're

546
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,360
ready to go.
You want to be back on the court,

547
00:25:07,361 --> 00:25:08,650
on the field,
things like that.

548
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,280
But if we don't take the proper
progression,

549
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:15,070
you know,
we risk having you reinjure and then

550
00:25:15,071 --> 00:25:16,870
you're right back in that same boat.
We don't,

551
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:21,400
we only want to have you miss the most
limited block of time that you can.

552
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:25,210
So I never want to,
I don't want people to miss one more

553
00:25:25,211 --> 00:25:26,630
practice game,
you know,

554
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,110
match workout or whatever.
Then they have to,

555
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,570
uh,
but same time we don't want to put them

556
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:34,510
in a situation that's unsafe.
So it's always a,

557
00:25:34,511 --> 00:25:35,560
it's a balancing act.

558
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:39,850
So in your time of doing this,
have you had people that didn't respond

559
00:25:39,851 --> 00:25:41,440
to this particular topic?
Definitely,

560
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,130
yeah.
Definitely.

561
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,020
Yeah.
And were they the people that we talked

562
00:25:44,021 --> 00:25:45,910
about before that don't exercise and

563
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,300
Arnie each shape or is it across the
board?

564
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,280
You know,
I would have to go back and look and,

565
00:25:50,281 --> 00:25:52,570
and kind of critically evaluate each
case.

566
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,610
Um,
certainly,

567
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,570
you know,
we worry about the patient that has

568
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,070
lower like baseline fitness,
like their overall health is poorer,

569
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,500
you know,
and what their response might be.

570
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:09,730
But I think that's information that is
still to come.

571
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,410
But definitely,
I mean,

572
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,380
some of the people that have responded
the most dramatically,

573
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,540
like for example,
you and John Dudley,

574
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,980
I mean,
you guys are fanatical about your

575
00:26:20,981 --> 00:26:23,470
nutrition.
You're working out regularly,

576
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,500
you're doing all kinds of things to
optimize your chance to not,

577
00:26:28,601 --> 00:26:29,920
you know,
in this case he'll,

578
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,940
but in other instances perform.
Uh,

579
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,500
and I have to believe that that has,
you know,

580
00:26:35,501 --> 00:26:36,400
that's a huge factor.

581
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,573
Yeah.
I would wonder what,

582
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:42,560
how much of a factor it is if your body
is conditioned in a way to constantly

583
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:44,010
generate muscle tissue

584
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,850
and breaking down and rebuilding and she
was always constantly under stress.

585
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,430
Definitely has to be a part of it.
Mm.

586
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,960
You know,
I think it's,

587
00:26:51,961 --> 00:26:56,580
um,
it's not the typical realm of my

588
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:59,490
specialty to be looking at all those
other factors.

589
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,120
But I think with all of the information
that's becoming available,

590
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,320
one of the cool things for me has been,
it's forcing me to have to learn about

591
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:09,310
it.
It's forcing me to have to take look at

592
00:27:09,311 --> 00:27:09,720
it,
you know,

593
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,660
how can we do better?
What are we ignoring?

594
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,380
And I think if you're not looking at
every aspect of that wheel,

595
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,010
then you're missing a chance to do as
good as you can for,

596
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,990
for each patient.
Um,

597
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,500
and it might be things that we have to
do before somebody even has treatment.

598
00:27:25,501 --> 00:27:29,070
We may have to bring them up to some
baseline level with a number of

599
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:30,690
different things,
you know.

600
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,120
Um,
and so,

601
00:27:33,121 --> 00:27:36,390
and the other side of it too is we're,
we're in a,

602
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,630
we're in a system now where there's so
much information,

603
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,090
you know,
one person can't be your source for

604
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:44,460
everything,
so you really have to have a good team

605
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,440
all around you.
Um,

606
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,610
I think that's really important.
I find myself more and more seeking

607
00:27:50,611 --> 00:27:51,870
help,
help and just saying,

608
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:53,310
hey,
I just don't,

609
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:54,780
I don't know enough about this.
Like,

610
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,130
can you,
can you help me with this?

611
00:27:56,131 --> 00:27:59,340
Or explain it better or you know,
can I have the patient talk with you

612
00:27:59,341 --> 00:28:01,290
and,
and maybe get some more information.

613
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:05,280
And I think that may give them even
better a chance to do well just because

614
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:08,190
the options and the possibilities are so
comprehensive and time.

615
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,210
So,
you know,

616
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,510
in,
in a typical orthopedic practice,

617
00:28:12,511 --> 00:28:15,750
you don't have a ton of time to go
through all of this with every patient.

618
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,600
Um,
and so you just have to make sure that

619
00:28:18,601 --> 00:28:22,190
you're providing resources and,
and getting them as good information is

620
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,820
available.
One of the things I thought was

621
00:28:23,821 --> 00:28:25,770
interesting,
you were telling me that there's been

622
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:29,820
really good results with people going
into a sauna directly after treatment.

623
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:32,760
Well,
I don't know that there's been good

624
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:34,050
results.
I think it's,

625
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:37,050
it's interesting.
And the things that you've talked about

626
00:28:37,051 --> 00:28:39,780
for other applications in terms of heat
shock proteins,

627
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,190
you know,
there's some belief that that may either

628
00:28:44,191 --> 00:28:48,390
assist the cells and pro proliferation
or their ability to,

629
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,640
you know,
have as robust a,

630
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,950
um,
a response as possible.

631
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,090
You know,
that's not proven.

632
00:28:54,091 --> 00:28:55,590
That's,
that's hypothesis.

633
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,410
But I think it's interesting and again,
it's,

634
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,980
it's falls into the category of a lot of
these things that we're talking about

635
00:29:01,981 --> 00:29:05,070
where the science,
the basic science is,

636
00:29:05,071 --> 00:29:07,710
they're like,
we understand how it happens in the

637
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:10,170
embryo,
in the developing child.

638
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,460
We know what it does in a lab.
Like we can add these things to a petri

639
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,190
dish and watch it,
watch these changes happen.

640
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,340
But nobody has demonstrated this in a
human,

641
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,500
in a clinical trial where we're treating
an injury.

642
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,570
So we have to be very careful about
that.

643
00:29:24,571 --> 00:29:27,660
And that in fact that the FDA is very
clear that,

644
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,330
you know,
we cannot be making those claims.

645
00:29:30,331 --> 00:29:34,170
Companies can't be making those claims
about their products and physicians

646
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:39,171
cannot be making claims and marketing
their practice to drive people to them

647
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,960
stating that these things were.
Now

648
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,380
when you talk about heat shock proteins,
um,

649
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,260
I dunno if you can answer this question,
but is there a difference between the

650
00:29:47,261 --> 00:29:49,210
heat shock proteins that you receive
from,

651
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:54,310
say like a steam shower,
like a steam room versus a sauna versus

652
00:29:54,311 --> 00:29:56,360
even a hot bath?
I've heard of people saying that you'd

653
00:29:56,370 --> 00:30:00,940
get heat shock proteins from a very hot
bath and I think you would have to,

654
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:05,440
there would have to be some kind of
biopsy or blood test and you know,

655
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:08,670
sample like have people go through each
of those things and control for all

656
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:09,950
those factors.
Right.

657
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:14,080
But the whole idea is just being
involved in an environment that's

658
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:16,630
extremely hot,
where your body is like,

659
00:30:16,631 --> 00:30:19,330
what is this guy doing?
And then it produces the heat shock

660
00:30:19,331 --> 00:30:20,750
proteins to try to compensate.
Yeah.

661
00:30:20,751 --> 00:30:22,860
As a protective mechanism.
So that the,

662
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,400
just the,
the knowledge of this,

663
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:27,160
I mean this is really interesting
because people have been using saunas

664
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:29,560
forever and it was all sort of
anecdotal,

665
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,060
oh to sauna makes me feel great.

666
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,580
And I would look at them like,
well what are these assholes doing?

667
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:36,040
They're going to go in there and sweat.
I always thought it was people that were

668
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:38,380
just like lazy and they didn't want to
lose weight.

669
00:30:38,381 --> 00:30:40,210
And so they went to the sauna and they
thought they lost weight.

670
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,550
Yeah.
I really did think they're just dropping

671
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:46,150
water.
But I'm talking to Doctor Rhonda Patrick

672
00:30:46,151 --> 00:30:51,151
and she was explaining the um,
the benefits of a sauna where there was

673
00:30:52,061 --> 00:30:57,061
one study where mortality decreased 40%
from all causes.

674
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,130
Turning the guy literally using the
sauna.

675
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,140
Yeah.
All cause mortality was less.

676
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,070
Yeah.
40%.

677
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:07,030
Here it is right now using the sauna
four to seven times per week associated

678
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:11,290
with a 40% lower all cause mortality.
Might be heat shock,

679
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:13,330
protein science,
daily.com.

680
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:16,990
Fascinating stuff.
Um,

681
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:17,800
yeah,
I can click on it.

682
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,700
Click on it.
Young Jamie,

683
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:19,950
here we go.

684
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:24,790
So get a little larger than the Journal
of American Medical Association.

685
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,530
So serious stuff,
right?

686
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,290
I mean that it's a peer reviewed
journal.

687
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:33,400
Yeah.
I assume that there may be some validity

688
00:31:33,401 --> 00:31:35,530
of the information.
Amazing.

689
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,490
Um,
yeah,

690
00:31:36,491 --> 00:31:37,720
I mean if that's correct,
if the,

691
00:31:37,721 --> 00:31:40,480
if,
if all I have to do is get in a sauna

692
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,410
and I,
you know,

693
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:46,450
can decrease my chance of death from all
you had all diseases by 40% like cancer,

694
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,230
heart attack,
leukemia.

695
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,510
Amazing.
Here's what a suitable replacement,

696
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:55,790
hot bath won't be as robust but can
increase blood flow of eight Harvard and

697
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:59,050
cleat increase heat shock proteins.
So she saying it just won't be as

698
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:01,330
robust.
Say she's never taken one of my baths.

699
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,170
So it's,
you know,

700
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:07,170
a simple thing to find out or like what
you could do yourself is check your

701
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:09,280
heart rate,
blood pressure,

702
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,050
temperature,
you know,

703
00:32:11,051 --> 00:32:13,740
just like,
just take those as like a baseline right

704
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:18,340
on after each of those sessions and see
if there's difference.

705
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,700
How much is your body temperature
elevate during those things and how much

706
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:25,300
of it is a surface here is can you can,
you can't elevate your core temperature

707
00:32:25,301 --> 00:32:27,040
too much or you're going to have,
that's what I'm saying,

708
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,070
enzymatic breakdown.
Like these bad things are gonna happen.

709
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,670
Yeah.
I wonder like what the line is the point

710
00:32:33,671 --> 00:32:38,470
of diminishing returns where the sauna
becomes detrimental versus beneficial.

711
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,320
Yeah.
And I wonder like how a cryotherapy

712
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,620
comes into play with that as well
because cold shock proteins also show

713
00:32:45,621 --> 00:32:48,090
some great benefit in reducing
inflammation and yeah.

714
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,710
So it was just an amazing time for all
the different,

715
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,220
definitely the options that are
available to people.

716
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,220
I think at the same time,
uh,

717
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:01,580
one of the things that we have to be
conscious of is,

718
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,580
you know,
being responsible about how we use this

719
00:33:04,581 --> 00:33:07,280
information and what we're telling
patients.

720
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:12,670
And you know,
I think there's a lot of misinformation

721
00:33:12,681 --> 00:33:15,050
and a lot of people taking advantage of
that.

722
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,870
And so,
um,

723
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,140
you know,
when we want to try to avoid that,

724
00:33:18,141 --> 00:33:20,480
I want to try to give people good
information so that they can ask the

725
00:33:20,481 --> 00:33:24,230
right questions and they can evaluate
places where they're going to see if

726
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,320
they're comfortable with what they're
being told and what's being offered.

727
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:32,770
So I think there's something like 200
plus regenerative medicine clinics that

728
00:33:33,171 --> 00:33:35,210
have popped up in the last couple of
years.

729
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:38,450
Hmm.
And that means at least 40 of them are

730
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:40,640
bullshit.
My math,

731
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:41,503
I mean,
maybe,

732
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,250
maybe 80,
maybe more than that.

733
00:33:43,251 --> 00:33:44,720
And they always 90.
Well,

734
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:49,160
I just think people have to be cautious
and careful about,

735
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:49,781
you know,
what,

736
00:33:49,781 --> 00:33:51,200
what am I eating,
what they're saying.

737
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:55,970
And some of these places have received
direct letters from the FDA saying,

738
00:33:55,971 --> 00:33:58,670
hey,
you can't say that he can't be making

739
00:33:58,671 --> 00:34:00,400
claims,
um,

740
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,450
go over some stuff that's definitely
beneficial.

741
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:05,690
Like platelet rich plasma,
PRP injections.

742
00:34:05,691 --> 00:34:07,430
People have had real benefit from that.
Right?

743
00:34:07,431 --> 00:34:08,264
Sure.
So,

744
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:11,090
um,
that has some validated outcome studies.

745
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,870
Um,
there is a comparison study with prp,

746
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:18,680
uh,
on tennis elbow or lateral epicondylitis

747
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:21,320
comparing that to corticosteroid
injections,

748
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,560
which is a common treatment for attempt
to give pain relief.

749
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,020
Um,
in the particular study that I'm

750
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:30,350
thinking of,
they had 73% of the patients that

751
00:34:30,351 --> 00:34:35,351
receive prp had relief of their pain
compared to about 50% of patients with a

752
00:34:35,421 --> 00:34:39,140
steroid injection.
So that's a head to head study comparing

753
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,370
treatment and you know,
the advantage seem to be to prp.

754
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,830
Now.
What is the difference between the

755
00:34:45,831 --> 00:34:47,470
results?
I don't know if you've even know that

756
00:34:47,471 --> 00:34:50,090
it's between the results of PRP and
Regena keen.

757
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,320
I don't know much about that product
actually.

758
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:55,730
I mean,
I know what it is.

759
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,170
I know that it was,
you know,

760
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,490
going on in Germany.

761
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:01,420
I know a lot of people traveled.
Tate ranting,

762
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,950
Koby Bryant,
all those guys flew Alex Rodriguez or

763
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,380
thing Dana White did to the president of
the UFC.

764
00:35:06,381 --> 00:35:07,900
He went in there for tonight,
us,

765
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,193
you know,
and uh,

766
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:14,270
found through intramuscular injections.
There's a deep relief of tinnitus.

767
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,640
Mm hmm.
You know,

768
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,630
so that,
I mean,

769
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,150
that's great.
And again,

770
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,470
there may be great applications for all
of the different things that fall into

771
00:35:24,471 --> 00:35:29,471
this category of biologic treatment.
Time is going to tell us what things pan

772
00:35:30,801 --> 00:35:32,660
out clinically to be best.
I mean,

773
00:35:32,661 --> 00:35:37,661
you can look at all kinds of factors and
we can draw conclusions from that.

774
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,350
But ultimately,
you know,

775
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,020
the proof is going to be when we have,
you know,

776
00:35:43,021 --> 00:35:45,810
robust clinical studies that compare
treatment.

777
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,850
Um,
and you know,

778
00:35:47,851 --> 00:35:52,851
we have follow up physical exams and we
have follow up imaging to see exactly

779
00:35:53,191 --> 00:35:56,490
what's happening.
So we know what we are hoping for.

780
00:35:56,491 --> 00:35:58,890
We know what we want to see.
We want to see that.

781
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,350
Yeah.
We have this cell that has a potential

782
00:36:01,351 --> 00:36:04,950
to differentiate into other tissue and
actually causes healing.

783
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:09,840
Um,
but nobody has demonstrated that yet.

784
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,580
There are some studies,
I mean there's,

785
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,790
there's 35 studies,
a 29 or animal,

786
00:36:14,791 --> 00:36:19,050
there's six,
six or seven that are a human trial.

787
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,900
I,
I just saw this a review paper and I

788
00:36:21,901 --> 00:36:23,520
don't,
I didn't know if the review paper had

789
00:36:23,521 --> 00:36:25,200
been written before.
One of the more recent,

790
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,050
um,
clinical trials was published.

791
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,060
Um,
there's,

792
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:35,230
so the one was on a knee arthritis and
the others were on mostly foot and ankle

793
00:36:35,341 --> 00:36:36,174
stuff.

794
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,820
Um,
the most recent,

795
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:42,120
uh,
as from USC and a in combination with,

796
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:45,180
uh,
a doctor that's in Indiana and they

797
00:36:45,181 --> 00:36:49,890
looked at patients that had a knee
arthroscopy and they resected part of

798
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:52,110
the meniscus.
So we call it a meniscectomy.

799
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:55,860
And part of it was essentially cut out.
So there was a tear.

800
00:36:55,861 --> 00:36:58,920
They cut out the bad tissue,
they left the remaining healthy tissue

801
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:04,820
and they did an Mri and they measured on
the Mri,

802
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:09,870
the volume of meniscal tissue and they
injected the patient with a bone marrow

803
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:12,450
aspirate.
So in this case was the,

804
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,430
you know,
be Mac or bone marrow aspirate,

805
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,353
um,

806
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,470
which is stem cells extracted from bone
marrow.

807
00:37:18,471 --> 00:37:19,930
Like the way Daniel Cormier they had
done.

808
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,480
Correct.

809
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,540
Okay.
So they injected that into the knee and

810
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:26,660
then I think,
I want to say it was four or eight

811
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,760
months later,
I think it was eight months,

812
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:33,820
they re imaged the knee and they found
that there was a 15% increase in the

813
00:37:34,611 --> 00:37:39,260
municipal volume.
So the patients had apparently grown

814
00:37:39,261 --> 00:37:40,100
meniscal tissue.

815
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:45,200
I had a meniscus scope on my left knee,
um,

816
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,190
from,
uh,

817
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,240
an acl injury that I had,
I had an acl surgery,

818
00:37:50,241 --> 00:37:51,920
but there was still some meniscus
damage.

819
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,190
And then,
uh,

820
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:53,930
they,
they,

821
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:56,840
um,
at the time of the acl injury they tried

822
00:37:56,841 --> 00:38:00,230
to stitch up the meniscus and okay.
They just tried to,

823
00:38:00,231 --> 00:38:01,580
tried to repair it,
cut it out.

824
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,390
And it was a problem for me for several
years.

825
00:38:05,391 --> 00:38:09,320
And then finally a tour became a bucket
handle tear where it locks,

826
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,350
you know,
so it locked my knee.

827
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,250
I was brutally painful in the middle of
the Jujutsu class.

828
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,990
It was really bad.
So,

829
00:38:14,991 --> 00:38:16,790
uh,
I had to get it scoped and then once I

830
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:18,080
got at scoped,
it was oak.

831
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:23,110
It was functional but it would provide
me with maybe every couple of weeks.

832
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,520
It would be painful.
There would be something going on

833
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,260
[inaudible] it would be a problem.

834
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:34,520
You shot some stem cells in there a year
ago.

835
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,810
I've zero problems with it since zero.
Nothing.

836
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:40,780
It's like,
like I don't even acknowledge that I

837
00:38:40,781 --> 00:38:43,360
have a knee that's weaker than the other
knee anymore.

838
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:46,750
It doesn't even feel like that anymore.
My left knee feels exactly like my right

839
00:38:46,751 --> 00:38:47,584
knee now.
Yeah,

840
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:52,890
it's crazy.
I mean for a decade plus I had pain in

841
00:38:53,321 --> 00:38:55,370
that knee,
one,

842
00:38:55,570 --> 00:39:00,570
one injection a year later,
nothing and it was almost within two

843
00:39:02,831 --> 00:39:05,110
months.
Within two months after the injection.

844
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:09,250
I felt like a significant difference.
I was like waiting for those days

845
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:10,960
because those days when I pushed it
hard,

846
00:39:10,961 --> 00:39:12,980
particularly after kickboxing.
Okay.

847
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:15,940
There's something about those like hard
pad work,

848
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,480
like kicking the pads on the MTA.
Any particular things that you were

849
00:39:19,481 --> 00:39:23,080
doing that made it feel the worst?
That was the big one is just such a

850
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,200
striking cause.
Striking is just jarring and there's

851
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,390
just so much,
and I just think there's just,

852
00:39:28,391 --> 00:39:30,490
there was laxity in the knee.

853
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,590
Said a word to sound wrong.
No,

854
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,150
I know it's word.
I say that it sounds,

855
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,340
it sounds wrong.
Laxity sounds wrong.

856
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:39,820
It sounds like a laxative,
but sounds like I'm making up a word.

857
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,950
You know,
I was laxity from my laxative.

858
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:46,120
Um,
but that kicking motion would always,

859
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:48,160
you know,
and it would just hurt and I would put

860
00:39:48,161 --> 00:39:49,080
ice on it.
You know,

861
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,440
it'd be just go about my day.
I'm like,

862
00:39:50,441 --> 00:39:51,011
wow,
it's fine.

863
00:39:51,011 --> 00:39:53,170
It's not swelling up to now.
It's something you don't think about.

864
00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:54,280
Dude,
it's zero.

865
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:59,460
I ran a trail yesterday and the
mountains like brutal steep trail for

866
00:39:59,681 --> 00:40:02,140
two miles.
I have zero pain in it today.

867
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:03,070
So this is

868
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:07,930
it kind of thing that I think gets a lot
of us excited about what the potential

869
00:40:07,931 --> 00:40:08,680
is.
You know,

870
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:13,240
you know,
you've got a patient here that you had

871
00:40:13,241 --> 00:40:17,200
him meniscal tear then you,
so you had attempted to repair.

872
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:22,230
We know that about 15 to 22% of those
fail the meniscal repairs.

873
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,340
You know,
it's a disappointing number.

874
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,140
You know,
we like things to be much higher than

875
00:40:26,141 --> 00:40:27,740
that.
But that's what the,

876
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,430
the facts are.
That's what the,

877
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:33,070
you know,
larger scale studies have told us.

878
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,910
And to anybody that has a meniscal
injury,

879
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:38,390
that's a risk worth taking because if
you know what it feels like to have a

880
00:40:38,391 --> 00:40:39,830
bucket handle tear and someone says,
Hey,

881
00:40:39,831 --> 00:40:41,540
you have an 80% chance of success,
you're like,

882
00:40:41,541 --> 00:40:42,090
I'm in man.

883
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:42,923
Yeah,
take it.

884
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,240
We'll also for the,
this is what we know,

885
00:40:45,241 --> 00:40:49,020
this is why we will take the risk.
So for a young person that has the tear,

886
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,870
you know,
we want to preserve that meniscal tissue

887
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:56,340
and for as long as their life as we can.
So certainly you are willing to risk and

888
00:40:56,341 --> 00:41:00,750
even you sometimes might attempt to
repair something that you think even has

889
00:41:00,751 --> 00:41:04,740
a lower chance just because they're
young and you want to preserve that.

890
00:41:04,741 --> 00:41:09,210
Why you want to preserve it as we know
that if you even resect a small amount

891
00:41:09,211 --> 00:41:12,600
of the meniscal tissue,
like Sapta 25%,

892
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:15,690
um,
it will change the contact pressure in

893
00:41:15,691 --> 00:41:17,550
the knee.
So they do these,

894
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,510
you know,
color pressure studies where it,

895
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:24,990
it shows you the amount of,
of force and its distribution.

896
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:29,700
And with a normal meniscus,
it's evenly distributed into the,

897
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,800
you know,
on the medial femoral condyles the end

898
00:41:31,801 --> 00:41:33,980
of the femur and the tibial plateau is

899
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,460
the top part of the Shin Bone.
So when those come together with a

900
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:40,010
normal meniscus in there,
the pressure's,

901
00:41:40,011 --> 00:41:43,250
even if you resect part of that,
now you see this point loading.

902
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:47,180
So you see these hot spots where it's,
there's a much greater amount of pr of

903
00:41:47,181 --> 00:41:49,670
pressure.
Sort of like when you go to a restaurant

904
00:41:49,671 --> 00:41:52,670
and you're sitting at a table and it's
wobbly and you have to stick a napkin

905
00:41:52,671 --> 00:41:54,990
under one of the legs.
What about analogy?

906
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,760
Maybe?
Probably bad analogy.

907
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,950
Not following you,
but you don't,

908
00:41:57,951 --> 00:41:58,880
I'm talking about,
I've done that.

909
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,900
Eating is dump then.
Yeah.

910
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:04,100
And then the guy comes on,
you kind of test the one leg a little

911
00:42:04,101 --> 00:42:04,761
higher.
Yeah.

912
00:42:04,761 --> 00:42:07,370
A piece of a wedge under there.
And I know what you're saying.

913
00:42:07,371 --> 00:42:08,790
Yeah.
I don't know that it's not the best,

914
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,280
if that makes sense for you.
It doesn't,

915
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:10,910
that's fine.

916
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,110
I tried,
I swung and I missed.

917
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,160
Let's continue.
That's all right.

918
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:17,780
But the point of this story is that we
know if we cut part of that out,

919
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,140
your cartilage is going to have some
wear and tear over time.

920
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:23,330
Now,
whether or not you develop symptoms from

921
00:42:23,331 --> 00:42:25,700
that is hard to,
it's hard to predict.

922
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,440
Well,
I'm pretty sure that that's what was

923
00:42:27,441 --> 00:42:31,880
going on with my knee because it,
because it was uneven and the jarring

924
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:34,610
action of kicking a heavy bag or kicking
pads.

925
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:37,400
So I think that what I was trying to get
to,

926
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:40,280
and I was taking the long path to get
there was that,

927
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:43,100
you know,
in the past what we might've said is,

928
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,060
Eh,
you know,

929
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,760
you had an acl tear,
he had meniscus tear,

930
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,050
you know,
your niece crappy,

931
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,760
sorry.
Like you're going to have some pain,

932
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:52,850
but in what are you trying to,
what do you kickbox and for eight year

933
00:42:52,851 --> 00:42:54,980
age anyway,
I've heard that this is,

934
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,270
this would be the attitude,
right?

935
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,870
Um,
and really what that means is I'm

936
00:42:59,871 --> 00:43:02,720
uncomfortable because I don't have an
easy solution for you.

937
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:06,560
So I'm going to blame you for,
there's also people wanting you to adopt

938
00:43:06,561 --> 00:43:10,100
their lifestyle or them to think that
your lifestyle is foolhardy.

939
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:14,150
There's definitely that.
I just trying to find an easy solution

940
00:43:14,151 --> 00:43:17,570
so that you don't come back into the
office and complain about something that

941
00:43:17,571 --> 00:43:19,760
we don't have an easy solution for.
Also,

942
00:43:19,761 --> 00:43:21,110
I think they're trying to talk sense
into you.

943
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,630
That might be true to their mind.
You know,

944
00:43:23,631 --> 00:43:26,860
like if you don't do martial arts and
you see some knuckleheads out there,

945
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:29,210
risk of having to come to my office,
that's true.

946
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:32,780
It's also you see someone who's doing
this and hurting themselves and you tell

947
00:43:32,781 --> 00:43:33,261
them,
hey look,

948
00:43:33,261 --> 00:43:34,990
you've got to stop doing that.
You know,

949
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,400
cause you think you're doing the right
thing by telling them that.

950
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:38,480
Right.
But you know,

951
00:43:38,481 --> 00:43:40,430
you're,
you're essentially telling someone that

952
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:42,530
all that stuff that makes you feel
amazing,

953
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:46,100
alleviates stress,
builds confidence.

954
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:48,110
It makes you,
it's part of your soul.

955
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,190
Yeah.
It's a big part.

956
00:43:49,191 --> 00:43:51,530
Yeah.
So how am I supposed to rip that away

957
00:43:51,531 --> 00:43:54,470
from me?
For some people it becomes a real,

958
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:56,060
I mean,
obviously with certain injuries.

959
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:56,781
Yeah.
But,

960
00:43:56,781 --> 00:43:58,790
um,
some people we have to have the hard

961
00:43:58,791 --> 00:43:59,660
discussion.
It's like,

962
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:01,760
yeah,
I know you want to keep doing this.

963
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:04,250
I know you think you're heading that
direction,

964
00:44:04,251 --> 00:44:08,000
but this is over.
Well when they do replacements now

965
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,860
because uh,
I know a guy who's got a knee

966
00:44:09,861 --> 00:44:13,280
replacement and one of the things he was
saying actually I know quite a few

967
00:44:13,281 --> 00:44:14,710
people,
one of them was on the podcast,

968
00:44:14,711 --> 00:44:17,180
his name is Dan Pena and he was saying
that,

969
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:20,480
uh,
the problem is with his knees is they

970
00:44:20,481 --> 00:44:21,590
only been this way.

971
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:25,280
Now they don't move side to side.
There's no lateral movement and the

972
00:44:25,281 --> 00:44:27,470
knee,
like there's no wiggle room.

973
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:32,670
He can't go side to side.
Like the knee is just goes straight up

974
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:36,360
and back like this artificial ne.
Does that make sense?

975
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:37,031
No,
you're,

976
00:44:37,031 --> 00:44:41,640
you got skeptical hippo face.
It depends on a lot of factors.

977
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:44,760
Um,
maybe for him,

978
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,520
um,
there may be other patients that don't

979
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:50,520
have quite as much stiffness in their
knee,

980
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,610
but no one who gets a hip replacement is
doing triathlons.

981
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,620
They shouldn't be,
or a knee replacement rather,

982
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:58,170
they shouldn't be.
Yeah.

983
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:03,150
So it's limited with 100% certainty that
implant will loosen and fall apart.

984
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:06,690
Huh?
Why can't they make a knee of fake knee

985
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,610
that's as good as a real knee?
Hmm.

986
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:12,750
That's a long question.
Are they lazy?

987
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,750
I wouldn't think so.
Certainly.

988
00:45:15,751 --> 00:45:18,040
Uh,
certainly lots of motivation and uh,

989
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,253
you know,
an now,

990
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,650
oh my God,
if they could fix a Ni and turn a knee

991
00:45:22,651 --> 00:45:26,040
into a superior need to the need that
you have now.

992
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:30,600
So the,
I mean,

993
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:32,580
it's like an overall question,
right?

994
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:37,610
Why can you not a replace something
better than you can repair it will

995
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:40,500
wouldn't,
wouldn't we want to be going more

996
00:45:40,501 --> 00:45:45,501
towards repair and renewal regeneration.
We're hoping that we can figure

997
00:45:46,351 --> 00:45:48,310
something out for that.
But that's what factors did.

998
00:45:48,311 --> 00:45:51,600
The knee replacement,
you have a metal component that you're

999
00:45:51,601 --> 00:45:53,230
either,
you know,

1000
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:57,140
cementing to the bone or you're,
you know,

1001
00:45:57,330 --> 00:46:00,660
applying it to the bone and having bony
in growth into the implant.

1002
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:04,560
So there,
there's an interface between that

1003
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:09,770
implant and the body and to come up with
something that would never allow that to

1004
00:46:10,651 --> 00:46:12,540
separate.
I mean that's,

1005
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:14,100
you know,
how would you do that?

1006
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:18,060
Yeah,
I know a guy who had bone cancer.

1007
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:22,230
It's a really kind of a terrible story,
but he lived near a golf course and the

1008
00:46:22,231 --> 00:46:25,800
golf course used these horrible
pesticides and it leaked into the ground

1009
00:46:25,801 --> 00:46:28,620
water and all the people in his
neighborhood got cancer,

1010
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:33,060
like a huge epidemic of cancer in his
neighborhood and he got bone cancer and

1011
00:46:33,061 --> 00:46:37,720
they replaced one of his femurs with a
metal rod and uh,

1012
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:40,770
it causes him significant discomfort in
some of those,

1013
00:46:40,771 --> 00:46:41,340
in my training.

1014
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,490
It's pretty gnarly.
Swore.

1015
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:44,940
What's that about?
Talk to me.

1016
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,550
Total femur.
Yeah.

1017
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:50,250
It cut someone open like a fish and
stick a new leg in there.

1018
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:51,570
Uh,
you literally do,

1019
00:46:51,571 --> 00:46:54,270
it's an incision about bat long.
Whoa.

1020
00:46:54,271 --> 00:46:57,930
He's making his arms about what the
spreads your arm about four feet.

1021
00:46:57,931 --> 00:47:00,480
Three feet.
It's the entire length of however long

1022
00:47:00,481 --> 00:47:02,550
your thighs she wow.
Wow.

1023
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,150
Yeah.
Okay.

1024
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,390
Snarly yeah,
they all get infected.

1025
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:07,770
They do.
It seems like it.

1026
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:11,190
Wow.
Now Post op like right away or you mean

1027
00:47:11,191 --> 00:47:14,850
in time time and just because your body
is rejecting it,

1028
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:18,900
it doesn't know what to do with action.
It's just you got this big hunk of metal

1029
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:22,150
and the up,
um,

1030
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:24,360
bacteria forms,
you know,

1031
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:28,500
this sort of slime layer that can't be,
um,

1032
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:30,730
even with antibiotics,
you know,

1033
00:47:30,731 --> 00:47:33,880
blood can't get to the metal.
So you formed this layer and then it's

1034
00:47:33,881 --> 00:47:36,280
just once it's contaminated,
you can't control it.

1035
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:39,250
Whoa.
So the metal on the leg,

1036
00:47:39,251 --> 00:47:42,530
the fake leg just get slimy.
Uh,

1037
00:47:42,531 --> 00:47:44,770
not so much that it gets slimy.
It's just the,

1038
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:48,550
the stuff that's produced by the
bacteria adheres to the metal.

1039
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,140
Oh.
So,

1040
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:54,610
and it's just so much metal in the body.
There's so much opportunity.

1041
00:47:54,611 --> 00:47:55,780
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah.

1042
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,170
So what do you do when it gets infected?
You gotta open them up again,

1043
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,030
clean it up.
You do.

1044
00:48:01,031 --> 00:48:05,980
You try by the end of the line is a
invitation.

1045
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:08,710
The limb has to go,
Whoa,

1046
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:11,710
Daddy.
Jamie is Jamie almost threw up.

1047
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,210
Got An image.
Pull it up.

1048
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:15,460
Hold it up.
You don't come.

1049
00:48:15,461 --> 00:48:16,960
You're a doctor.
How dare you.

1050
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:18,460
How dare you say,
don't pull it up.

1051
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:19,630
You're,
this is what you do,

1052
00:48:19,631 --> 00:48:21,910
man.
That's what I'm feeling bad.

1053
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,180
And it's was right.
I don't know where you're going to get

1054
00:48:25,181 --> 00:48:26,010
the total femur.

1055
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:26,520
What?
Yeah.

1056
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,770
That's go large with that sir.
I want to see that.

1057
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,470
I don't even,
holy Jesus.

1058
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:36,730
Whoa my God.
First of all,

1059
00:48:36,731 --> 00:48:39,430
what am I looking at there?
So that's the f the Femur,

1060
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,760
that's a metal femur.
And the

1061
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:47,950
just google replaced Femur and look at
the flags opened up there and you have

1062
00:48:47,951 --> 00:48:50,190
to make measurements.
And so it's basically a,

1063
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,310
a total knee and a total hip.
And then all of the bone in between has

1064
00:48:54,311 --> 00:48:59,311
been replaced with that metal.
And then your foot's just attached to

1065
00:48:59,351 --> 00:49:01,840
your regular Shin below it.
Correct.

1066
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:04,780
And what does this normally used for?
Like how often?

1067
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:05,700
What does this,
uh,

1068
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:09,400
so that would be in the case of a
infection and you know,

1069
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:14,500
there's the cases that we had were
usually multiple fractures below a hip

1070
00:49:14,501 --> 00:49:19,501
replacement and then,
and then below a longer stem hip

1071
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,770
replacements.

1072
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,600
Finally,
you've got just no bone.

1073
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:25,420
Uh,
the other reason would be infected bone

1074
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:29,440
that you had to resect and then still
another reason would be in the case of

1075
00:49:29,441 --> 00:49:32,050
tumor where you have to,
you're doing limb salvage.

1076
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,420
Yeah.
That was this gentleman's now that one

1077
00:49:34,421 --> 00:49:37,910
above Jamie where it's got like they're
spreading it apart afar.

1078
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:38,793
Yeah.
Are there,

1079
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:42,160
what's going on there and what's all
that stuff on the outside,

1080
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:44,830
that orange stuff.
Oh,

1081
00:49:44,831 --> 00:49:45,550
so,
uh,

1082
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:50,110
that's called io band and it's a thin
film that we cover over where we're

1083
00:49:50,111 --> 00:49:53,020
making an incision in surgery is to help
prevent infection.

1084
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:54,880
So we naturally have,
you know,

1085
00:49:54,881 --> 00:49:59,140
staff and other bacteria on the surface
of the skin and you put this sticker

1086
00:49:59,141 --> 00:50:03,100
cover on top of the skin and then
anything that's around the wound is,

1087
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:04,900
is contained.
It says play video.

1088
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:05,920
I think you should listen to him.

1089
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,930
Click on that.
Let's see what that is.

1090
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,100
Yeah,
let's see who this is.

1091
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,860
Oh,
it's just a picture of that that says

1092
00:50:11,861 --> 00:50:15,430
that I could visit page,
click play video and here we go.

1093
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,530
Ooh,
I'm scared.

1094
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:20,320
I get nervous.
Oh Daddy.

1095
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:23,720
Whoa boy.
Ooh.

1096
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:27,470
Now that seems valley view surgery
through incisions,

1097
00:50:27,471 --> 00:50:29,120
like better about this big,
yeah,

1098
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:31,940
a little tiny incisions.
Now that seems odd because that seems

1099
00:50:31,941 --> 00:50:35,540
like a very old person.
Like I'm looking at the lack of muscle

1100
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:38,180
tissue,
either very old or very unathletic.

1101
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:39,403
Uh,
yeah.

1102
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,140
And um,
this is like good evaluation.

1103
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:44,030
That's incredibly traumatic then.
I mean,

1104
00:50:44,031 --> 00:50:47,720
that's
how does someone recover from that?

1105
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:51,020
It's slow
now.

1106
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:55,040
Is there a potential use of stem cells
in the case of like,

1107
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:57,530
is it,
is it possible to regenerate a bone?

1108
00:50:57,531 --> 00:51:00,980
I know they've built a woman,
a artificial bladder through

1109
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:05,720
sympathetically bone is one of the
tissues that is a part of that line of

1110
00:51:05,721 --> 00:51:07,160
the Mesenchymal stem cells.

1111
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,050
Right.
That's what I'm saying is from the Misa

1112
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:10,430
Durham.
So you think that could be something

1113
00:51:10,431 --> 00:51:13,760
down the line that they could be able to
accomplish there?

1114
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:18,170
I mean,
replacing that femur and it's cartilage

1115
00:51:18,171 --> 00:51:20,060
covering at the knee and the hip.
I mean,

1116
00:51:20,061 --> 00:51:22,500
I think that's at this point,
um,

1117
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,473
uh,
fantasy.

1118
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,521
Yeah,
but isn't that one,

1119
00:51:24,521 --> 00:51:27,140
but I said when,
when if someone came up to the person

1120
00:51:27,141 --> 00:51:28,490
that had the telegraph and said,
Hey,

1121
00:51:28,491 --> 00:51:30,800
do you think one day I'll be able to
send Dick Pics from this thing?

1122
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:34,250
They're like,
well right now that's the fantasy,

1123
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:36,110
right?
Don't you think?

1124
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:39,470
Probably most likely,
you know they would look at you like

1125
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,690
you're crazy person.
Well when I was a,

1126
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:47,630
this is an embarrassing story to admit,
but when I was about 13 I went next door

1127
00:51:47,631 --> 00:51:51,950
to my neighbor's house and he was kind
of a computer nerd at the time.

1128
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:56,340
But you know computer nerds at the time
or playing with like commodore 64 right?

1129
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,940
And he's like,
dude look at this.

1130
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:05,720
I can hook my computer up to the phone
and I can type on the screen in my

1131
00:52:05,721 --> 00:52:07,490
friend down the street.
We'll see what I wrote.

1132
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,980
And I was like,
that's the dumbest thing I've ever

1133
00:52:09,981 --> 00:52:10,491
heard.
Dude,

1134
00:52:10,491 --> 00:52:14,000
can we like go play football?
He talking about,

1135
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:17,210
so apparently not very forward thinking
guy.

1136
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,610
Cause obviously we're doing that quite a
bit now.

1137
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:24,140
I had a showtime special in 2005 and
Netflix special actually that eventually

1138
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:27,980
wound up on showtime.
But I had a joke in there about cell

1139
00:52:27,981 --> 00:52:29,540
phones,
um,

1140
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:33,320
about people sending you a text message
and the part of the joke was like,

1141
00:52:33,321 --> 00:52:36,200
it takes you four presses to get an S.
Right?

1142
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,680
Like why don't you just call me?
Because like it was before anybody had

1143
00:52:39,681 --> 00:52:40,440
figured out.

1144
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,980
Right.
We'll keyboard and I'm like,

1145
00:52:42,981 --> 00:52:45,770
why are you making me read like this is
so stupid.

1146
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:49,580
I thought it was just like a dumb trend
that was going to go away.

1147
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:52,880
And now if someone calls me I will fuck
you.

1148
00:52:52,881 --> 00:52:54,010
Call me for,
yeah.

1149
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:57,380
It's very strange what's happened in
just 12 years.

1150
00:52:57,830 --> 00:52:59,360
Yeah.
It's a chill little shift in how we

1151
00:52:59,361 --> 00:53:00,530
communicate with people.
Right.

1152
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,750
A massive one.
I mean how uh,

1153
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:07,870
how disruptive to your life is it to
have to like send emails now?

1154
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:12,560
I mean to sit down and like type and eat
like email,

1155
00:53:12,561 --> 00:53:14,360
respond back.
Some emails you like,

1156
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,340
people email me with like a bunch of
questions.

1157
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:17,960
It's a big chore.
It's like homework,

1158
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:19,670
I got to sit down and it takes a lot of
time.

1159
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:20,990
Whereas,
you know,

1160
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:23,720
a text is like a quick response like,
hey,

1161
00:53:23,721 --> 00:53:25,650
why don't I just,
I'm so used email,

1162
00:53:25,651 --> 00:53:26,010
I send

1163
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:28,410
a lot of emails.
I have so much email.

1164
00:53:28,411 --> 00:53:30,570
I mean,
well I do all the booking for this show

1165
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:31,231
too.
I mean,

1166
00:53:31,231 --> 00:53:34,410
while I have a guy,
Matt stags who contacts people,

1167
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:36,210
but I reached out to a lot of people as
well.

1168
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:39,600
So like a lot of the booking and the
different things that I do,

1169
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:43,470
I contact people and you know,
the best way to do it is through an

1170
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:44,161
email.
It's like,

1171
00:53:44,161 --> 00:53:44,941
Hey,
you know,

1172
00:53:44,941 --> 00:53:47,010
I would really love to talk to you about
this or that.

1173
00:53:47,011 --> 00:53:48,710
I have a question about that brief
emails.

1174
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,730
I would bet sometimes,
yeah,

1175
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,710
but I've gone,
I've,

1176
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:54,330
I've had some,
yeah,

1177
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:57,510
that's the problem is the volume,
the sheer volume I get is just

1178
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,940
unmanageable to the point where people
think I'm ignoring them.

1179
00:54:00,941 --> 00:54:01,411
I'm like,
man,

1180
00:54:01,411 --> 00:54:03,060
I'm not ignoring you.
I didn't even see it.

1181
00:54:03,061 --> 00:54:05,910
It just got lost in the tsunami of
emails that came in.

1182
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,560
Like,
if I go on vacation,

1183
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,860
I hardly communicate.
I barely do anything.

1184
00:54:10,861 --> 00:54:13,500
Maybe I'll put up a social media post
and you know,

1185
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,670
just just to like,
cause it's kind of a part of the job.

1186
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,460
Right.
But I don't pay attention to the emails.

1187
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:22,260
I just leave him alone and then I get
home and I'll go,

1188
00:54:22,261 --> 00:54:24,210
oh my God,
there's 2000 emails.

1189
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,640
I'll have 2000 emails in a few days.
I don't know.

1190
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,720
I'm not exaggerating.
Do you go through all this?

1191
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:31,980
I do my best.
Try to.

1192
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:33,320
I look for my friends.
Yeah.

1193
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:36,120
You know,
I look for people that are important and

1194
00:54:36,121 --> 00:54:37,200
uh,
look for,

1195
00:54:37,201 --> 00:54:39,930
uh,
acquaintances that I like and you know,

1196
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,030
work related stuff.
Yeah.

1197
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:45,450
But it's a mess.
I have several email accounts to which

1198
00:54:45,451 --> 00:54:48,240
helps,
like people that are important to me get

1199
00:54:48,241 --> 00:54:49,410
the big one.
You know,

1200
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:51,710
you don't get,
you don't get the patent on it.

1201
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:52,970
Don't worry about it.
I like you.

1202
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,220
I don't think,
I don't want to,

1203
00:54:54,221 --> 00:54:55,160
don't.
If you do,

1204
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:57,090
I'll give you the real one.
I just want to let you know,

1205
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,160
you won't tell anybody.
People don't like to be on the outside.

1206
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:00,330
You tell him about that and they're
like,

1207
00:55:00,331 --> 00:55:01,260
which one way up,
bro?

1208
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:02,403
Yeah.
Alright.

1209
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,360
Why worry about it man?
What list of mine?

1210
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,430
Why worry about it,
man?

1211
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:06,703
Yeah.
Yeah.

1212
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,240
But if you have to ask the question,
yeah,

1213
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:13,260
it's not good.
I wonder when it's going to pass what

1214
00:55:13,261 --> 00:55:13,981
we're doing.
I mean,

1215
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:17,160
when it's not going to be this,
it's not going to be typing like what's

1216
00:55:17,161 --> 00:55:18,800
the next thing is,
uh,

1217
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:19,561
you know,
it's,

1218
00:55:19,561 --> 00:55:22,230
it's definitely not going to be videos
where you force people to watch.

1219
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,050
The beautiful thing about an emails,
I can kind of scan it through.

1220
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:27,120
What's this guy saying not interested.

1221
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,640
Next,
have you messed around with a like

1222
00:55:29,641 --> 00:55:31,040
dragon dictation?
Yes.

1223
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:34,170
Yes.
It's amazing for notes when you're in a

1224
00:55:34,171 --> 00:55:37,770
car or when I'm,
if I have an idea in my head and there's

1225
00:55:37,771 --> 00:55:39,570
no way I could type it on my phone that
quickly.

1226
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:41,150
Have you ever seen how good it works?
It's,

1227
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:42,013
no,
it's very good.

1228
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:43,013
Yeah.
No,

1229
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:44,510
we'll just,
what comes back?

1230
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,940
The most recent,
uh,

1231
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,180
versions of it?
Yeah.

1232
00:55:48,181 --> 00:55:50,010
Like this right here.
Check this out,

1233
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:54,600
doctor.
Rati Mcgee is an amazing human being.

1234
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:57,990
He has fresh breath and his hair is
wonderful.

1235
00:55:58,890 --> 00:55:59,820
Oh,
look at that.

1236
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:00,990
Perfect.
Perfect.

1237
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:02,400
Perfect.
Yeah,

1238
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:04,290
100%.
That's incredible.

1239
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:06,420
That's pretty good.
I mean it is,

1240
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,900
it really is incredible.
And you can do that in your car if you

1241
00:56:09,901 --> 00:56:12,270
have an idea.
So you're not some asshole is texting

1242
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:16,080
because sometimes like neal,
Neal Brennan had the best analogy for

1243
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:16,381
it.
You know,

1244
00:56:16,381 --> 00:56:20,280
Neal Brennan is standup comedian,
Co creator of the Chappelle show.

1245
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:21,810
He had the best analogy.
He goes,

1246
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:25,030
my notebook is essentially like a net
for catching ideas.

1247
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,950
Yeah.
And you've got to catch those ideas as

1248
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:28,900
quick as you can.
I'm sure that's a good way of looking at

1249
00:56:28,901 --> 00:56:30,520
it.
So like if you're,

1250
00:56:30,521 --> 00:56:32,770
if I'm in a car and I have an idea,
I'm like,

1251
00:56:32,771 --> 00:56:35,020
oh my God,
I got to get this out before I forget.

1252
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:38,440
So I start repeating it to myself.
And then if I'm at a red light or

1253
00:56:38,441 --> 00:56:42,130
something on press that record button,
very responsible of you.

1254
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:44,080
Um,
I'm very responsible when it comes to

1255
00:56:44,081 --> 00:56:45,370
texting and driving.
That's good.

1256
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:46,330
Um,
I just,

1257
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:49,510
I think that is one of the most
infuriating things.

1258
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,860
That's fucking terrible.
Yeah.

1259
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:54,640
It's like you're going 60 plus whatever
miles an hour.

1260
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:59,710
The amount of distance that you cover in
a glance where you are not looking at

1261
00:56:59,711 --> 00:57:01,990
the road and things can happen at any
moment.

1262
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,170
Just to me it's super disturbing.
Yeah.

1263
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:07,750
Anyway,
back to the back to the grind.

1264
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:09,340
Um,
what did,

1265
00:57:09,341 --> 00:57:10,370
what do you got there that you would
like to?

1266
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,020
Sure.
Well,

1267
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,630
um,
so you know,

1268
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:16,330
okay,
so we touched a little bit about,

1269
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,620
about,
you know,

1270
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:20,090
all of the,
all of the elements of the care of the

1271
00:57:20,091 --> 00:57:20,960
person,
right?

1272
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:25,160
So it's,
it has to be more than just giving you a

1273
00:57:25,161 --> 00:57:27,380
shot and send you on your way,
right?

1274
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,170
If you truly have an injury and we're
trying to recover you,

1275
00:57:30,171 --> 00:57:35,171
then what also comes along with that is
the appropriate rehab protocol.

1276
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:39,710
And none of those are defined yet for,
for what some of these things that we've

1277
00:57:39,711 --> 00:57:40,580
done.
Um,

1278
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:44,300
but we're trying to develop that and
dial it in and hone it down.

1279
00:57:44,301 --> 00:57:45,500
For me,
for me right now,

1280
00:57:45,501 --> 00:57:49,730
the easiest thing is to try to adapt it
from a surgical rehab.

1281
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:51,650
Um,
and I'm not a physical therapist

1282
00:57:51,651 --> 00:57:53,570
obviously,
so I tried to collaborate with those

1283
00:57:53,571 --> 00:57:57,920
guys and girls that are smarter than me
in that,

1284
00:57:57,921 --> 00:57:59,030
uh,
avenue.

1285
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:02,210
But the principles are the same,
right?

1286
00:58:02,211 --> 00:58:05,660
So you have,
you have an injury that you're trying to

1287
00:58:05,661 --> 00:58:06,590
heal.
Now,

1288
00:58:06,591 --> 00:58:08,360
in some cases it's,
you know,

1289
00:58:08,361 --> 00:58:12,440
we've created the injury or we've done
the thing that the patient has to

1290
00:58:12,441 --> 00:58:14,750
recover from.
In the case of an injection,

1291
00:58:14,751 --> 00:58:18,020
you have an injury.
If you've done the injection and now we

1292
00:58:18,021 --> 00:58:21,740
need the effect to happen,
whatever it is that we're hoping that

1293
00:58:21,741 --> 00:58:23,480
we'll be.
So,

1294
00:58:23,481 --> 00:58:28,481
but then you can't ignore the fact that
if somebody has a bad shoulder,

1295
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,400
we'll,
maybe we may decrease the pain,

1296
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:32,840
but if they,
if they're,

1297
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,900
if their motion is poor,
if their strength is poor,

1298
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:40,670
if it's not functioning correctly,
then how can we be achieving the best

1299
00:58:40,671 --> 00:58:43,040
result if we're not also attending to
that?

1300
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:44,810
Right?
So it's a multi step,

1301
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:47,540
no doubt.
And then in the more that we're learning

1302
00:58:47,541 --> 00:58:49,340
about all these other factors,
I mean,

1303
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:52,220
like again for you,
I mean,

1304
00:58:52,221 --> 00:58:54,350
you're paying attention to your sleep,
you're paying attention to your

1305
00:58:54,351 --> 00:58:56,300
nutrition,
you're on,

1306
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:57,500
uh,
you know,

1307
00:58:57,501 --> 00:59:01,760
a variety of supplements that are meant
to help a lot of these processes.

1308
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:05,690
And I think we're going to get better
and better at it.

1309
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,550
And that has got to be pretty critical
as well.

1310
00:59:07,551 --> 00:59:09,200
Right?
It's got to be hugely important,

1311
00:59:09,201 --> 00:59:11,840
especially like staying away from
inflammation.

1312
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:14,420
Enhancing foods are inflammatory foods.
Yeah,

1313
00:59:14,421 --> 00:59:16,010
no doubt.
So,

1314
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,540
um,
yeah,

1315
00:59:17,541 --> 00:59:20,060
I think it's gotta be critically
important and we try to share that

1316
00:59:20,061 --> 00:59:21,980
information with people.
There's,

1317
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,960
um,
for athletes,

1318
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:25,790
uh,
like a website that you could pull up

1319
00:59:25,791 --> 00:59:29,450
and we can share as the college and
Professional Athlete,

1320
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:34,250
a dietetics association,
I think it is college in professional

1321
00:59:34,251 --> 00:59:36,830
college and professional athlete.
I was like,

1322
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:41,120
what college and professional athletes,
and I don't even know what that means.

1323
00:59:41,121 --> 00:59:42,430
We all have Collagen,
right?

1324
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:44,510
College hand.
Yeah.

1325
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:48,770
So these guys have some great
information and good infographics that,

1326
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:50,900
um,
that we utilize.

1327
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:52,250
You know,
since I'm not a,

1328
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,500
that looks good.
I'm not a dietician,

1329
00:59:54,501 --> 00:59:58,010
so I have to rely again on people that
have good information.

1330
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,860
I think these guys have a good,
reliable,

1331
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:05,570
they're good reliable source and uh,
they've got great infographics if you go

1332
01:00:05,571 --> 01:00:06,404
to,

1333
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,060
mmm.

1334
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:15,600
Uh

1335
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,220
hmm.
Educational Resources.

1336
01:00:21,221 --> 01:00:22,660
There you go.
Yeah.

1337
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:25,600
So this will pull up some,
some different things,

1338
01:00:25,601 --> 01:00:28,810
balancing extra exercise,
induced inflammation.

1339
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:30,640
Now here's a good question.
Um,

1340
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:35,650
because uh,
it's pretty much universally agreed that

1341
01:00:35,651 --> 01:00:36,341
rest,
ice,

1342
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:37,600
compression,
elevation,

1343
01:00:37,601 --> 01:00:39,850
all those different things that people
have said in the past,

1344
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:43,330
there is benefit to a particular icing
things.

1345
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,180
But yeah,
there's,

1346
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:45,860
there's a lot of debate,
right?

1347
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:49,150
There's some debate now.
Certainly there's like a definite,

1348
01:00:49,151 --> 01:00:51,700
uh,
anti ice community.

1349
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:53,020
Yeah.
What is that out there?

1350
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:54,730
Do you think it's legit?
Well,

1351
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:57,490
there can't,
there's not a downside to it.

1352
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:58,480
I mean,
to ice.

1353
01:00:58,570 --> 01:00:59,980
I don't think so.
I mean,

1354
01:00:59,981 --> 01:01:02,770
we've used it regularly and so I don't
know.

1355
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,240
There's,
there's definitely a group that,

1356
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:06,400
um,
and I don't know all of their arguments

1357
01:01:06,401 --> 01:01:08,920
against,
but may should take the former UFC

1358
01:01:08,921 --> 01:01:11,720
bantamweight champion.
She had had a podcast with this guy who

1359
01:01:11,721 --> 01:01:13,570
was the anti ice guy.
Yeah.

1360
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,720
I got this whole thing.
See a flat earth guy to no,

1361
01:01:16,721 --> 01:01:18,860
but he doesn't believe in dinosaurs I
made is not,

1362
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:19,690
no,
I made that up.

1363
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:20,523
Yeah.

1364
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:22,871
I don't know.
I mean,

1365
01:01:22,871 --> 01:01:24,520
so you,
I believe he's a doctor,

1366
01:01:24,521 --> 01:01:25,091
but he,
you know,

1367
01:01:25,091 --> 01:01:30,091
he might be a fucking veterinary works
on no cat infections or something.

1368
01:01:30,251 --> 01:01:32,760
I don't know.
But I don't think there's a downscaling

1369
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:35,170
about that too.
So in my opinion,

1370
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:38,800
you know,
I've definitely had athletic injuries.

1371
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:41,050
Um,
I was a pitcher previously.

1372
01:01:41,051 --> 01:01:44,440
We routinely ice our shoulder and elbow
after pitching.

1373
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:46,720
Um,
I did it as a matter of routine and may,

1374
01:01:46,721 --> 01:01:49,270
it felt good.
It felt better when I did it and I

1375
01:01:49,271 --> 01:01:50,470
didn't.
But here's the question.

1376
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:55,650
It felt good at the time,
but it is that feeling good in any way.

1377
01:01:56,290 --> 01:01:57,700
Slowing the healing process.

1378
01:01:58,170 --> 01:01:59,003
Hmm.

1379
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:02,270
Hard to know.
I mean,

1380
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:03,320
that's where it gets weird,
right?

1381
01:02:03,321 --> 01:02:04,400
Yeah.
I don't know.

1382
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,600
To be frank.
God Damn it.

1383
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:07,700
I like it.
No,

1384
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:09,890
you're the,
you're the fucking genius,

1385
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:14,390
Dr. Guy
of you don't know we're doomed.

1386
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:17,180
They get back to me.
So,

1387
01:02:17,181 --> 01:02:17,960
uh,
what,

1388
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,740
I'll get you some good information.
It thank you.

1389
01:02:19,741 --> 01:02:20,220
Appreciate

1390
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:21,390
it.
What else you got here?

1391
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:26,720
Um,
so I think one of the interesting things

1392
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:30,400
about this whole topic,
um,

1393
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:34,590
and the possibility of healing from
utilizing this type of treatment,

1394
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:40,090
um,
is how it allows you to go through the

1395
01:02:41,101 --> 01:02:45,630
process of healing without this fibro
vascular response.

1396
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:50,660
So the typical healing cascade has an
inflammatory phase,

1397
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:53,700
proliferative phase and the maturation
phase.

1398
01:02:53,701 --> 01:02:58,620
So in the inflammatory phase,
you have neutrophils and white blood

1399
01:02:58,621 --> 01:03:03,621
cells and these enzymes that are present
that are trying to start the process.

1400
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:09,060
Then in the proliferative phase,
you're having what's called angiogenesis

1401
01:03:09,061 --> 01:03:13,560
and that means the development of new
blood vessels and vasculature to the

1402
01:03:13,561 --> 01:03:15,030
area.
Um,

1403
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:18,840
and your body's producing fiber blasts
and you're laying down tissue in this

1404
01:03:18,841 --> 01:03:23,040
sort of haphazard manner.
So it's just kind of piling on in there.

1405
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:26,340
Um,
and then the maturation phase is when

1406
01:03:26,341 --> 01:03:27,360
you have remodeling.

1407
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:31,560
So those,
that scar tissue is changing over time

1408
01:03:31,561 --> 01:03:34,920
and,
and developing into a tissue that's more

1409
01:03:34,921 --> 01:03:36,840
like,
or is the native tissue.

1410
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:42,300
So that occurs over a period of time.
And then a lot of times during that

1411
01:03:42,301 --> 01:03:45,240
process,
before you're fully matured in the

1412
01:03:45,241 --> 01:03:47,420
healing,
you're backed activities.

1413
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:49,013
Um,
the best.

1414
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:52,380
So let's just take an example.
Like when you sprain your ankle and then

1415
01:03:52,381 --> 01:03:54,060
you,
you know,

1416
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:58,530
you start feeling better and maybe you
go back to basketball within a couple of

1417
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:00,180
weeks.
At that point,

1418
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,240
if you've actually torn one of the ankle
ligaments,

1419
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:07,920
you don't have native ligament tissue.
That's the same structural properties.

1420
01:04:07,921 --> 01:04:09,510
It's not as strong.
I mean,

1421
01:04:09,511 --> 01:04:11,880
you might be developing the strength
around it,

1422
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:18,030
but it's not like the native tissue.
Now the hope is that we can demonstrate

1423
01:04:18,031 --> 01:04:21,300
now we know that this is the science.
This is what it's supposed to do.

1424
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:25,140
This is what it does in the developing
fetus.

1425
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,180
We see it in kids.
You know how,

1426
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:29,460
you know when your,
your daughter was real young,

1427
01:04:29,461 --> 01:04:31,850
she scratched her face,
the healing it will ring.

1428
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:34,540
It was like gone like the next day.
Um,

1429
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:39,150
so healing without scar is you know,
has to do with not forming this,

1430
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:42,930
these fiber,
this fiber blast or fiber vascular

1431
01:04:42,931 --> 01:04:47,931
response and in fiber optic phase.
Now what the cool potential of this to

1432
01:04:49,111 --> 01:04:54,111
me is if we can skip that and we can
have more complete healing and quicker

1433
01:04:56,731 --> 01:05:01,590
resolution to the native tissue,
then you're going to have those,

1434
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:03,330
the same properties,
you're going to be stronger,

1435
01:05:03,331 --> 01:05:05,730
you're going to be better,
you know,

1436
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:10,680
technically and hopefully you know,
clinically this pans out that you would

1437
01:05:10,681 --> 01:05:14,340
be more resistant and lower risk for
repeat injury because that's really our

1438
01:05:14,341 --> 01:05:19,300
goal is in treating patients is get them
back to their activity and decrease the

1439
01:05:19,301 --> 01:05:21,340
chance that they have to miss more time.

1440
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:25,540
How do you know how much to inject into,
nobody knows,

1441
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,100
oh Jesus.
Nobody knows that.

1442
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:31,960
This is one of the big questions that
that will be discovered with again,

1443
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:34,330
you know,
rigorous studies where we can look at,

1444
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,220
you know,
what should the dosing be,

1445
01:05:36,221 --> 01:05:38,800
what should the frequency of the
treatment be and what should these,

1446
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:43,150
the protocols before and after be a,
it's not defined in anybody.

1447
01:05:43,151 --> 01:05:46,660
That's telling a patient that they have
exactly what it should be.

1448
01:05:46,661 --> 01:05:50,080
I mean,
be wary of that because that has not

1449
01:05:50,081 --> 01:05:52,540
been discovered yet.
So trying to,

1450
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:53,830
we're trying to take,
you know,

1451
01:05:53,831 --> 01:05:57,790
we're taking the information from our
experience and applying it that way.

1452
01:05:57,791 --> 01:05:59,350
It's,
it's not the,

1453
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:02,170
it's not the best way to go about this
and it,

1454
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:06,520
it's one of the things that prp suffered
from is that all of the things everybody

1455
01:06:06,521 --> 01:06:08,610
was using it for so many different
things and,

1456
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:12,670
and just kind of hoping that it was the
magic bullet that it was going to treat

1457
01:06:12,671 --> 01:06:15,400
all the things that we had difficulty
treating.

1458
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:18,370
Um,
and even all of the studies that were

1459
01:06:18,371 --> 01:06:19,660
coming out,
you know,

1460
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:23,830
people were using different centrifuges
and applying it for different reasons,

1461
01:06:23,831 --> 01:06:26,290
different protocols was just a mishmash
of information.

1462
01:06:26,291 --> 01:06:29,670
It wasn't valuable.
How d how does platelet rich plasma will

1463
01:06:29,671 --> 01:06:33,520
work?
So it has growth factors and cytokines

1464
01:06:33,521 --> 01:06:34,820
and the,
um,

1465
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:37,870
the,
the platelets release proteins and

1466
01:06:37,871 --> 01:06:42,490
things and those things help mediate
that inflammatory response and help the

1467
01:06:42,491 --> 01:06:43,390
healing process.
I mean,

1468
01:06:43,391 --> 01:06:46,120
that's kind of the basics.
Do you think that they could work in a

1469
01:06:46,121 --> 01:06:51,121
symbiotic fashion with like this
information that adding prp to,

1470
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:56,080
uh,
some cellular treatment like bone marrow

1471
01:06:56,081 --> 01:06:58,460
fat or the placental tissue,
uh,

1472
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:01,930
and that line of treatment can help
expand the cells.

1473
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:05,110
Ooh.
So that gets us to an important point,

1474
01:07:05,111 --> 01:07:06,610
which is,
uh,

1475
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:11,560
expanding the cells has been done and is
not currently legal in the United

1476
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:15,130
States.
So there was a place,

1477
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:19,570
and they do it in other countries,
but here if you,

1478
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,420
if you more than men,
this is a mouthful.

1479
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:25,120
If you more than minimally manipulate
the tissue,

1480
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:30,750
then that is not under the guidelines of
the FDA for use of human cellular tissue

1481
01:07:31,451 --> 01:07:35,230
products.
So they were taking,

1482
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:40,350
for example,
bone marrow and plating it and growing

1483
01:07:40,601 --> 01:07:42,490
more sales,
bringing the patients back two weeks

1484
01:07:42,491 --> 01:07:44,610
later and injecting them with this,
you know,

1485
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:48,250
super production of cells,
which probably is great,

1486
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:51,580
but we don't know.
We don't know if that's safe.

1487
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:53,860
And,
and that has to be,

1488
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,360
you know,
that has to be taken through the

1489
01:07:55,361 --> 01:07:57,580
appropriate process.
So,

1490
01:07:57,910 --> 01:08:02,910
so you can't necessarily recommend
someone taking prp while they're taking

1491
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:06,670
some sort of a stem cell injections.
So here's the difference of that.

1492
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:12,200
A manufacturer can't say that we have a
product that is a combined prp stem cell

1493
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:16,050
injection.
Right?

1494
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,860
And it does this right.
That's illegal.

1495
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:22,760
But if you're a patient we can't put on
my website,

1496
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,040
I have the magic potion.

1497
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:30,040
It's PRP and amniotic fluid and tissue.
I just inject it and it can heal

1498
01:08:30,531 --> 01:08:32,540
anything.
I admire how responsible you are and how

1499
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:35,990
you keep cutting me off whenever I was
suggesting some ridiculous thing.

1500
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:41,560
But is would there be a benefit for a
patient potential benefit who's getting

1501
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:45,440
stem cell injections and also gets prp
at the same time?

1502
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:48,380
Or is it just theoretical?
Its theoretical right now.

1503
01:08:48,381 --> 01:08:50,210
Yeah.
But potentially,

1504
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:51,810
definitely.
Uh,

1505
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,830
there's potential and it's encouraging
to,

1506
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:58,250
you know,
that the possibility is there.

1507
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:00,840
It appears to be safe there.
You know,

1508
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:04,400
we don't have adverse reactions to it.
Um,

1509
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:08,870
and so,
and the point that I wanted to make is

1510
01:09:08,871 --> 01:09:13,871
that a physician can prescribe something
and use it off label.

1511
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:19,970
Right?
So the FDA doesn't regulate the practice

1512
01:09:19,971 --> 01:09:23,090
of medicine.
I can do that in my office,

1513
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:27,770
but I can't make claims about it and I
can't put it on social media and on my

1514
01:09:27,771 --> 01:09:31,310
website and say,
if I'm going to do this and I'm going to

1515
01:09:31,311 --> 01:09:35,030
fix your shoulder,
like come here if you have a meniscus

1516
01:09:35,031 --> 01:09:37,490
tear,
cause we do this injection and it's

1517
01:09:37,491 --> 01:09:38,210
gonna make you better.

1518
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:39,260
That's illegal.
That's,

1519
01:09:39,261 --> 01:09:40,760
I understand.
So,

1520
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:43,550
but I,
if somebody comes to my office,

1521
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,590
you know,
I can elect to do that because both

1522
01:09:45,591 --> 01:09:48,170
things are available.
Um,

1523
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:49,700
they have,
we have permission,

1524
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,110
you know,
to use them,

1525
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,510
but we're using it off label and I
understand.

1526
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:54,523
So,
um,

1527
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:58,160
when you say maximize cells,
that's the term used maybe.

1528
01:09:58,370 --> 01:10:02,240
What does the term used about prp in,
in conjunction think that it can

1529
01:10:02,241 --> 01:10:04,430
increase.
The proliferation of them is income.

1530
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:06,270
Stem cell.
Oh,

1531
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:10,490
how much of a time period would it have
to be between the injection and the PRP?

1532
01:10:11,330 --> 01:10:14,220
That's undefined again.
So what would you assume?

1533
01:10:14,221 --> 01:10:15,890
The way that,
the way that we're doing is we would do

1534
01:10:15,891 --> 01:10:17,260
the injection at the same time.
Uh,

1535
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:19,010
so yeah,
putting it in there together.

1536
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:24,350
So you really only have a narrow window
from when we take those frozen cells and

1537
01:10:24,351 --> 01:10:25,880
then we thaw them,
you know,

1538
01:10:25,881 --> 01:10:29,810
we have a short window when we can then
inject them and then there's,

1539
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:33,620
you know,
maybe between seven and 21 days that

1540
01:10:33,621 --> 01:10:37,910
those cells are viable in your shoulder
or your knee or wherever we inject it.

1541
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:40,580
So if someone gets an injection that
does PRP,

1542
01:10:40,581 --> 01:10:44,270
they would have to essentially get that
done within those seven to 21 days to

1543
01:10:44,271 --> 01:10:47,510
have some sort of a benefit of what
you're saying theoretically radicals

1544
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:48,403
that yeah,
that,

1545
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:51,890
that's uh,
that's how I would do it currently.

1546
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,930
Uh,
based on that information.

1547
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,030
It's fascinating stuff.
Yeah.

1548
01:10:56,570 --> 01:10:58,220
What else you got there?
Well,

1549
01:10:58,221 --> 01:10:59,210
so,
um,

1550
01:10:59,270 --> 01:11:01,280
we just,
I thought it was important to talk about

1551
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:05,930
the,
it's called section three 61 of the

1552
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:08,240
Public Health Service Act.
And this is the definition from the FDA

1553
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:12,980
on the use of human cell tissue and
cellular tissue products.

1554
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:17,550
So it has to match these criteria.
So you have to have minimal

1555
01:11:17,551 --> 01:11:20,580
manipulation.
That means you can't add things to it.

1556
01:11:20,581 --> 01:11:23,190
You can't combine it with other stuff,
you can't.

1557
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:25,500
Um,
like I was saying,

1558
01:11:25,501 --> 01:11:26,820
you can't,
you know,

1559
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:31,100
put it in the lab and grow it and add
things to it and then come bring the

1560
01:11:31,101 --> 01:11:34,020
patient back and treat them how this
isn't part of the,

1561
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:34,711
um,
part of it,

1562
01:11:34,711 --> 01:11:37,050
but we,
you can't treat patients on a,

1563
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:37,950
on a different day.

1564
01:11:37,950 --> 01:11:42,950
It has to be at the same time whenever
you're harvesting the cells or utilizing

1565
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:45,700
whatever it is you're using,
um,

1566
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:48,030
it has to be something called homologous
use.

1567
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:52,860
And what that means is whatever tissue
you're taking has to have the intention

1568
01:11:52,861 --> 01:11:57,210
of the purpose of that tissue for when
you put it into somebody's body.

1569
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:00,330
So for example,
uh,

1570
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,250
if I have,
uh,

1571
01:12:02,370 --> 01:12:06,240
if you have a fracture that's not
healing and I take a bone graft product,

1572
01:12:06,241 --> 01:12:10,440
so cadaver bone,
and we're going to use that to help heal

1573
01:12:10,441 --> 01:12:11,970
your fracture,
that hasn't healed.

1574
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:15,540
That is,
that's homologous use we have,

1575
01:12:15,541 --> 01:12:18,510
we're taking bone,
we're using it to become bone or to be

1576
01:12:18,511 --> 01:12:21,960
the scaffold for bone to heal and grow.
So,

1577
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:27,690
um,
it can't be combined with something else

1578
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:31,260
and it can't have,
it can't be intended to have a systemic

1579
01:12:31,261 --> 01:12:34,500
effect.
So now all of these things that I'm

1580
01:12:34,501 --> 01:12:37,200
explaining,
these are rules for manufacturers and

1581
01:12:37,201 --> 01:12:40,080
what they can,
what the rules are for them to be able

1582
01:12:40,081 --> 01:12:44,130
to market their product.
So for example,

1583
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:49,160
you can't take amniotic fluid and say
this is a product meant for IV infusion

1584
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:53,490
for treatment of whatever diabetes.

1585
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:55,680
Right?
And that is something that people do in

1586
01:12:55,681 --> 01:12:56,640
other countries,
right?

1587
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:59,310
They're doing in other countries,
you can do that in,

1588
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:04,110
you technically can't do that.
You can't manufacture a product and put

1589
01:13:04,111 --> 01:13:06,150
that on the labeling that that's what
it's intended for.

1590
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:08,040
But do they do that in America?
I,

1591
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:11,850
ve stem cells,
I've been told by patients that they've

1592
01:13:11,851 --> 01:13:15,390
gone to places that have suggested to
them that that was going to be the

1593
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:16,380
treatment.
Right.

1594
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:18,150
And what is,
what is going on there?

1595
01:13:18,151 --> 01:13:19,610
I'm not aware of it.
What,

1596
01:13:19,710 --> 01:13:21,930
how does that even work?
Do you know?

1597
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:23,730
It's not your wheelhouse.
No,

1598
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:25,980
but,
and nobody knows if it does.

1599
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:28,620
So it was just experimental.
It is.

1600
01:13:28,621 --> 01:13:29,780
I mean all of this,
you know,

1601
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:32,790
boss ruin is former UFC champion.
Do you ever treat him?

1602
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:35,140
I have no law to say that.
Um,

1603
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:37,440
uh,
something I can say talk about any

1604
01:13:37,441 --> 01:13:39,980
patient that unless they tell me,
okay,

1605
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:42,710
set it or they're sitting in front of me
talking about it and okay,

1606
01:13:43,330 --> 01:13:45,900
I'll give you permission.
It's that it's hipaa violation.

1607
01:13:46,370 --> 01:13:49,110
Just want a nation state for the record.
I give you permission.

1608
01:13:49,770 --> 01:13:51,480
Um,
bas and went to,

1609
01:13:51,481 --> 01:13:53,400
where did he said he'd go to Peru or
something like that.

1610
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,580
Went to the jungle,
some dude kill the chicken and then

1611
01:13:56,581 --> 01:13:59,630
showed some stem cells into him,
but a blood vein.

1612
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:03,510
He was saying it was fucking amazing if
you,

1613
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,430
you know,
you were to wait boss talks.

1614
01:14:05,431 --> 01:14:07,500
He's like,
it's like the energy was coming out of

1615
01:14:07,501 --> 01:14:09,030
my body.
Like Ah,

1616
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:11,710
he said that.
He literally felt like,

1617
01:14:11,730 --> 01:14:12,130
like

1618
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:15,340
some guy of Kung Fu and we'll be where
energy was like shooting off his

1619
01:14:15,341 --> 01:14:17,500
fingertips.
He said it was amazing.

1620
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:20,410
Like the emperor,
he's not the only guy that said that.

1621
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,880
You know Dan Bilzerian,
do you know Dan Bilzerian is the

1622
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,870
instagram guy with the boobs and the
butts?

1623
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:28,210
Uh,
he told me the same thing.

1624
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:31,360
He said that when he got it done,
he said it's amazing.

1625
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:35,980
He goes to Mexico to get it done.
Not recommended,

1626
01:14:35,981 --> 01:14:40,000
but he can't talk about it off air.
He'll be a little chatter box.

1627
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:45,030
Just you wait maybe,
well,

1628
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:49,720
what I'm interested in,
in what I was thinking for you threw me

1629
01:14:49,721 --> 01:14:50,920
off there.
Um,

1630
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:54,250
is,
is he going to with a specific intent of

1631
01:14:54,251 --> 01:14:58,150
treating something or is he just like
looking for the Fountain of Youth?

1632
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,790
Um,
I think he fucks so much.

1633
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:06,060
He doesn't have any sperm in his body
and he's trying to kicks,

1634
01:15:06,221 --> 01:15:07,010
I dunno.

1635
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:08,170
Yeah,
that guy's an animal.

1636
01:15:08,290 --> 01:15:11,110
But uh,
I think he's got a series of injuries.

1637
01:15:11,111 --> 01:15:13,810
I know that because he's had regena keen
for his neck.

1638
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:16,870
He put it up on a,
on instagram,

1639
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:20,350
like with instagram stories.
He was videoing himself while I was

1640
01:15:20,351 --> 01:15:24,620
getting injections in his neck,
which I've had a Regena keen

1641
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:26,020
interjections.
Yes.

1642
01:15:26,050 --> 01:15:30,760
It cured my cervical disc bulge.
Yeah.

1643
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:33,370
Yeah.
That and disco decompression,

1644
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:35,980
a spinal decompression,
you know with like a harness where

1645
01:15:35,981 --> 01:15:39,310
they're pulling on your neck that I had
a bulging disc in my neck that was

1646
01:15:39,311 --> 01:15:40,990
pushing on my unresolved.
Yeah,

1647
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:42,610
completely resolved.
Like on an MRI.

1648
01:15:42,611 --> 01:15:46,090
It doesn't exist anymore where I was
getting numb hands cause the Ulnar nerve

1649
01:15:46,091 --> 01:15:47,500
was being pressed upon.
Yeah.

1650
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:49,300
Huh.
Yeah it works.

1651
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:52,570
Some massive anti inflammation
properties.

1652
01:15:52,571 --> 01:15:57,010
I just don't think that it has the same
healing potential.

1653
01:15:57,070 --> 01:15:59,560
It seems like it reduces inflammation in
a giant way.

1654
01:15:59,950 --> 01:16:01,840
What's going on with,
um,

1655
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,510
by the way,
I had regena keen shot in my knee too.

1656
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:07,420
It didn't really show me.
So they didn't really have the same

1657
01:16:07,421 --> 01:16:09,130
effect.
This is a little bit,

1658
01:16:09,310 --> 01:16:14,310
so patients like yourself that have had
a number of injuries and a number of

1659
01:16:15,491 --> 01:16:17,590
treatments.
And one of the things that's got me

1660
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:22,570
enthusiastic about the potential of all
of this is when somebody tells me,

1661
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:23,411
look,
I've had this,

1662
01:16:23,411 --> 01:16:24,490
this,
this and this.

1663
01:16:24,910 --> 01:16:29,890
And then I had this,
what we're talking about and that it was

1664
01:16:29,891 --> 01:16:33,330
just completely different game changing,
just a hundred percent captured and

1665
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:34,360
different.
Look.

1666
01:16:34,361 --> 01:16:38,410
Mine right shoulder is not 100% but it
might be 90%.

1667
01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:40,870
You know,
and it's strong as fuck.

1668
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:44,140
Like I could do a lot of shit with it.
Like it doesn't do some insane stuff.

1669
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:44,561
Yeah.
Yeah.

1670
01:16:44,561 --> 01:16:46,420
And it's,
it doesn't bog things that I probably

1671
01:16:46,421 --> 01:16:48,160
wouldn't recommend,
but no pain.

1672
01:16:48,410 --> 01:16:49,510
Let go.
I can,

1673
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:51,290
why could do,
um,

1674
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:54,250
I take these 90 pound kettle bells and I
do windmills with them.

1675
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:55,151
Where you,
you know,

1676
01:16:55,151 --> 01:16:58,030
you're pressing overhead,
you know what a windmill is dropping

1677
01:16:58,031 --> 01:16:59,290
down.
Like that's what your shoulders

1678
01:16:59,291 --> 01:17:01,480
rotating.
I don't do that with 90 pounds,

1679
01:17:01,481 --> 01:17:03,430
but I know what it is.
But the,

1680
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,500
um,
the fact that I can do that with a

1681
01:17:05,501 --> 01:17:10,501
shoulder that was on the way probably to
getting on it was just amazing.

1682
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:14,670
My bow tie,
the most impressive thing was that push

1683
01:17:14,671 --> 01:17:17,990
up with the wheel thing.
What's that thing called?

1684
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:19,220
Oh,
the AB wheel.

1685
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:21,770
Now it's like a little roller that you
had your hand.

1686
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:23,340
Yeah.
Those things when you go for,

1687
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:26,450
what's that called?
The comfort of all havoc creates it.

1688
01:17:26,451 --> 01:17:27,580
There's sliders,
havoc.

1689
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:28,510
Sliders.
Okay.

1690
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:29,740
Uh,
amy,

1691
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:31,580
that was like,
why k sliders?

1692
01:17:31,581 --> 01:17:32,810
There's a video of it on seat.

1693
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:34,490
There's a video on my instagram,
Jamie,

1694
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:37,190
um,
from quite a while ago,

1695
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:39,350
but it was posts post,
excuse me,

1696
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:40,790
uh,
injection.

1697
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:44,930
Um,
it's from way back.

1698
01:17:44,931 --> 01:17:48,230
I want to say at least a year ago I was
doing that.

1699
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:50,480
But um,
yeah,

1700
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:53,870
there's my range of motion's 100%.
I mean,

1701
01:17:53,871 --> 01:17:56,120
at the most it's uncomfortable in
certain things,

1702
01:17:56,121 --> 01:18:00,410
but for a big one for me was archery
because um,

1703
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:02,750
you know,
I really enjoy it.

1704
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:05,570
I do it all the time and it's very
meditative to me and I,

1705
01:18:05,571 --> 01:18:06,830
I just,
I love archery.

1706
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:09,740
So for me,
like the idea of not being able to pull

1707
01:18:09,741 --> 01:18:11,270
my bow back,
I was,

1708
01:18:11,271 --> 01:18:12,560
it was really disturbing.
I was like,

1709
01:18:12,561 --> 01:18:13,970
Gosh,
I'm going to have to get the surgery

1710
01:18:13,971 --> 01:18:14,241
done.
Yeah,

1711
01:18:14,241 --> 01:18:16,010
you've been pretty committed to it for a
while.

1712
01:18:16,011 --> 01:18:19,670
Now I,
I'll shoot a hundred plus hours a day

1713
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:24,730
and I'm pulling back 84 pounds to 84
pound compound bow and I'm shooting it a

1714
01:18:25,010 --> 01:18:26,600
hundred times a day and there's no pain.

1715
01:18:26,630 --> 01:18:29,090
I did it yesterday.
All I'll look for hours.

1716
01:18:29,150 --> 01:18:30,910
Me and my friend Cam Haynes who,
you know,

1717
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:34,190
you met who came to talk to you as well.
Um,

1718
01:18:34,450 --> 01:18:37,140
you kind of indirectly got me,
uh,

1719
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:40,040
into it.
I don't know if I went to archery

1720
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:41,210
through John.
John Dudley.

1721
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:42,140
Yeah.
Yeah.

1722
01:18:42,141 --> 01:18:43,580
I know you're shooting all the time now,
right?

1723
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:46,490
Yeah.
So John got me this unbelievable,

1724
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,140
you know,
horror,

1725
01:18:48,170 --> 01:18:49,003
Hawaii,
uh,

1726
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:52,640
carbon spider bow.
It's like a,

1727
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:55,430
if you want it,
if you want to see,

1728
01:18:55,431 --> 01:18:57,530
uh,
any of my friends,

1729
01:18:57,531 --> 01:19:00,170
like make the greatest faces you've ever
seen.

1730
01:19:00,171 --> 01:19:02,030
I just,
I pull this thing out and it's like,

1731
01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:04,220
you know,
some space,

1732
01:19:04,221 --> 01:19:05,870
age weapon,
it looks like a bow.

1733
01:19:05,871 --> 01:19:07,440
The Batman would have,
yeah,

1734
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,600
yeah.
She bug out.

1735
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:11,510
Yeah.
Something like that.

1736
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:12,590
Yeah.
I would say Batman,

1737
01:19:12,591 --> 01:19:13,790
but yeah.
But yeah,

1738
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:16,760
it's um,
those bows or they're amazing.

1739
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:17,600
It's incredible.

1740
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,070
And it's uh,
yeah,

1741
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,930
I've only been able to go a couple of
times,

1742
01:19:20,931 --> 01:19:25,010
but I'm definitely hooked.
It's the most amazing meditation.

1743
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:26,510
I love it.
It's cause it's you,

1744
01:19:26,511 --> 01:19:30,770
when you're focusing on that shot,
you literally have no room for anything

1745
01:19:30,771 --> 01:19:31,371
else.
It's,

1746
01:19:31,371 --> 01:19:36,080
it requires so much concentration.
You're concentrating on the front hand

1747
01:19:36,081 --> 01:19:38,360
position,
front shoulder position,

1748
01:19:38,361 --> 01:19:41,180
where,
where the string touches the tip of your

1749
01:19:41,181 --> 01:19:42,830
nose,
the corner of your mouth.

1750
01:19:42,831 --> 01:19:46,560
And John is just an amazing coach.
So,

1751
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,830
you know,
totally unfair.

1752
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:50,480
I get,
that's the bow.

1753
01:19:50,481 --> 01:19:53,030
Then the first bow that I get to shoot
with,

1754
01:19:53,031 --> 01:19:57,380
and then John gives me the first lesson
that I've ever pulled a back.

1755
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:59,960
He's standing there right with me.
He's an Olympic coach by the way.

1756
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:02,600
He used to coach to the Olympic team and
he's amazing.

1757
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:03,730
Yeah.
I mean he really,

1758
01:20:04,490 --> 01:20:08,610
he's a great guy too.
And he can take years off of people's

1759
01:20:08,611 --> 01:20:09,870
learning.
I mean he's,

1760
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:12,690
he's absolutely taking years off my
learning curve.

1761
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,400
Yeah.
I'm going to sneeze.

1762
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:22,110
I hate when you say you're going to
sneeze and they put a lot of pressure on

1763
01:20:22,111 --> 01:20:23,520
yourself and you're like,
man,

1764
01:20:23,521 --> 01:20:24,400
I'm,
I might not,

1765
01:20:24,401 --> 01:20:26,670
it might just look like a Weirdo for a
few minutes.

1766
01:20:26,671 --> 01:20:28,080
Did you find that video?
No,

1767
01:20:28,081 --> 01:20:29,130
it's in there.
I swear to God.

1768
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,380
So here's another,
uh,

1769
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:36,440
kind of crazy thing about the,
the placental derived treatments

1770
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:43,440
is it they actually have a antimicrobial
properties.

1771
01:20:43,650 --> 01:20:45,600
Whoa.
So this is crazy.

1772
01:20:45,601 --> 01:20:47,730
I mean we kind of know this,
um,

1773
01:20:47,790 --> 01:20:51,060
you know,
one of the functions of the amniotic

1774
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,850
membrane is to protect the,
the developing baby.

1775
01:20:53,851 --> 01:20:55,320
Right?
But,

1776
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:56,400
um,
in,

1777
01:20:56,401 --> 01:20:59,010
in one of the things it does protect it
from infection,

1778
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:03,030
boy,
they were able to demonstrate was that,

1779
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:04,860
um,
when they,

1780
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:09,450
they've actually introduced bacteria,
like literally injected bacteria onto

1781
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:11,490
these membranes and then they come back
and,

1782
01:21:11,970 --> 01:21:13,480
and check and it,
it,

1783
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:18,210
it has destroyed the bacteria so.
Huh.

1784
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:20,730
So ability to,
um,

1785
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:24,960
resist scar formation,
move through the,

1786
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:29,130
the fibrotic phase of healing and then
also the antimicrobial profit.

1787
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:32,150
So amazing.
That would be super beneficial.

1788
01:21:32,151 --> 01:21:35,090
Postsurgery right.
Cause that's a giant issue.

1789
01:21:35,091 --> 01:21:36,530
Staph infections and the like.

1790
01:21:36,590 --> 01:21:39,290
It's one of the things that you know,
frightens us most about,

1791
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:41,360
you know,
doing our procedures is,

1792
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:44,690
you know,
can we prevent infection?

1793
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:45,360
Yeah.

1794
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:49,470
Giant issue where people,
I mean I know because of the nature of a

1795
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:50,820
martial arts,
it just,

1796
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:52,850
everybody I know is that surgery.
Yeah,

1797
01:21:52,851 --> 01:21:57,550
that's pretty much.
And the big issue is post in post

1798
01:21:57,551 --> 01:21:59,370
surgery infections.
Yeah.

1799
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:02,340
Oh those guys are,
they're getting abrasions and everything

1800
01:22:02,341 --> 01:22:06,030
like that on the mat.
And then so then they're colonized with,

1801
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:10,620
you know,
Mrse out of whatever funk is in that

1802
01:22:10,621 --> 01:22:12,690
gym.
I tell everybody,

1803
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:15,060
if you are a grappler,
this is super important.

1804
01:22:15,061 --> 01:22:20,061
I want you to look up defense soap.
Defense soap is a soap company that was

1805
01:22:21,091 --> 01:22:24,390
created by my friend Guy Sacco.
And what is it?

1806
01:22:24,570 --> 01:22:29,190
It is all natural soap that promotes
healthy bacteria.

1807
01:22:29,191 --> 01:22:31,040
It doesn't destroy the healthy bacteria.
Hmm.

1808
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:33,720
But it's all tea tree oil,
eucalyptus oil.

1809
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:36,150
This shit is amazing.
And I used to get,

1810
01:22:36,570 --> 01:22:41,250
I've gotten staff at least twice.
I used to get ringworm all the time.

1811
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:41,971
Well,
not all the time,

1812
01:22:41,971 --> 01:22:46,250
but I got a couple of times and until I
was like super diligent about wool

1813
01:22:46,251 --> 01:22:48,120
washing myself,
like immediately afterwards.

1814
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:51,300
But once I started using two things,
probiotics,

1815
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:52,400
which is huge.
Um,

1816
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,900
acidophilus.
Yeah.

1817
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:59,060
Eating yogurt and a drinking Kombucha.
And then the next one in fact soap

1818
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:04,080
probably not,
but it's a little bit of something and

1819
01:23:04,110 --> 01:23:06,460
it's a little bit of something.
I think it's good to have.

1820
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:08,250
It's good to have.
Um,

1821
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:10,540
probiotics.
I like Kimchi.

1822
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:14,200
I tried to take my probiotic probiotics
and multiple forms.

1823
01:23:14,410 --> 01:23:15,790
Um,
this stuff that I was drinking when he

1824
01:23:15,791 --> 01:23:16,900
got here.
Kombucha.

1825
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:19,570
I love this stuff.
I drink all the time.

1826
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:23,020
Or that you like or did he met mixing
you gotta be careful because I'm a low

1827
01:23:23,021 --> 01:23:24,880
sugar guy,
so like the grapes,

1828
01:23:24,881 --> 01:23:27,800
there's some of them that are delicious,
but they have a lot of sugar.

1829
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:28,390
Sure.
This,

1830
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:30,640
this multigrains does not have a lot of
sugar.

1831
01:23:30,641 --> 01:23:33,970
I don't want to see what it's got.
I think it's something like 10 grams per

1832
01:23:33,971 --> 01:23:35,740
serving or something like that.
It's really,

1833
01:23:35,741 --> 01:23:38,020
that sounds high.
I think I've seen them lower.

1834
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:40,030
Oh two.
Yeah.

1835
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,280
Two grams.
So yeah,

1836
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,940
that's what you want the grapes high
grape is,

1837
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:48,600
but the taste wonderful and write
essays.

1838
01:23:48,610 --> 01:23:50,110
Yummy.
That's a problem.

1839
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:53,080
This does not taste so good.
But you know you're getting something

1840
01:23:53,081 --> 01:23:55,450
good in it.
And this is the fight your way through

1841
01:23:55,451 --> 01:23:57,100
it.
The important stuff is that you get the

1842
01:23:57,101 --> 01:23:59,700
strong Kombucha.
This is the brand that I really liked.

1843
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:01,810
I don't work for them.
They're not a sponsor.

1844
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:03,300
GTS,
Kombucha,

1845
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:05,100
gt gts.
Um,

1846
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:09,910
this stuff is awesome but you have to be
over 21 because it has more than one

1847
01:24:09,911 --> 01:24:13,720
half of 1% alcohol by volume because the
fermentation process,

1848
01:24:13,721 --> 01:24:14,620
cause it's so strong.

1849
01:24:14,730 --> 01:24:15,940
I see.
So they make you get,

1850
01:24:15,941 --> 01:24:17,320
you show your Id.
Interesting.

1851
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:19,150
They actually pulled it from whole
foods.

1852
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:20,980
I don't know if you know this.
I thought,

1853
01:24:21,130 --> 01:24:22,050
see,
I thought I saw,

1854
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:22,923
that's where I've seen it.
Yeah,

1855
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,230
they have it back.
But they pulled it from whole foods

1856
01:24:25,231 --> 01:24:28,330
until whole foods had to like put some
regulations in place to keep,

1857
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:31,020
you would literally,
if you were eight years old do,

1858
01:24:31,021 --> 01:24:32,770
you could drink one and not get drunk.
I mean,

1859
01:24:32,771 --> 01:24:34,930
it's not like,
it's not like you're going to get drunk

1860
01:24:34,931 --> 01:24:37,360
off of it,
but just due to regulations,

1861
01:24:37,361 --> 01:24:39,700
you have to listen to the law.
Exactly.

1862
01:24:42,130 --> 01:24:42,963
What else?
You got

1863
01:24:44,730 --> 01:24:45,850
got a lot of papers there,
buddy.

1864
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:49,360
Got Drawings and shit.
Charts and graphs.

1865
01:24:49,361 --> 01:24:52,660
Have to think about probably a bunch of
stuff you say.

1866
01:24:52,661 --> 01:24:57,350
Don't let joe talk about this.
Um,

1867
01:24:57,550 --> 01:25:01,450
what other questions have you come up
with along the way?

1868
01:25:01,451 --> 01:25:05,230
Or One big question I wanted to talk to
you about was something that I had a

1869
01:25:05,231 --> 01:25:07,870
discussion with Dr. Davidson about
recently.

1870
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:12,070
Um,
and Jeff was telling me that the most

1871
01:25:12,071 --> 01:25:17,071
recent procedure with stem cells is
injecting them directly into the discs

1872
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:19,780
for people that have degenerative disc
disease.

1873
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:21,910
And that there's some really promising
results.

1874
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:27,180
I've heard anecdotally of a number of,
uh,

1875
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:29,850
very positive outcomes,
uh,

1876
01:25:30,050 --> 01:25:31,850
with treatment like that.
Hmm.

1877
01:25:32,150 --> 01:25:34,070
But that's amazing.
Again,

1878
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:34,933
we,
you know,

1879
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:39,080
it's still too early,
so a lot is surely enough conservative

1880
01:25:39,081 --> 01:25:40,190
about this are really,
really,

1881
01:25:40,191 --> 01:25:42,350
really do appreciate that.
Although I'm giving you a hard time,

1882
01:25:42,351 --> 01:25:45,080
I feel you when you hustled.
I've really wrestled with it because,

1883
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,070
uh,
you know,

1884
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,570
again,
our whole training is based on,

1885
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:52,460
you know,
we need to do things that have an

1886
01:25:52,461 --> 01:25:54,290
evidence base for our patients.
I mean,

1887
01:25:54,291 --> 01:25:57,770
this is kind of the,
the foundation of what we do.

1888
01:25:58,310 --> 01:26:00,770
And so,
but we're in a unique situation,

1889
01:26:00,771 --> 01:26:03,080
so we have patients that,
um,

1890
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:08,090
one week this stuff is available and
it's legal to do and it's there and

1891
01:26:08,091 --> 01:26:09,740
people know about it now.
So they,

1892
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,720
they're seeking the information,
they come to us.

1893
01:26:12,510 --> 01:26:13,820
And even,
you know,

1894
01:26:13,821 --> 01:26:16,550
even before we started talking about it,
you know,

1895
01:26:16,551 --> 01:26:20,570
it started to be like here and there and
then all of a sudden it's like two,

1896
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:21,710
three patients a day.

1897
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:23,910
Now even more are saying,
well,

1898
01:26:23,911 --> 01:26:25,510
what about,
what about stem cells should,

1899
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:27,650
can I have stem cell?
And,

1900
01:26:27,651 --> 01:26:28,221
uh,
like,

1901
01:26:28,221 --> 01:26:30,020
okay,
well I'm going to have to back up and

1902
01:26:30,021 --> 01:26:31,100
like have the whole discussion.
Like,

1903
01:26:31,101 --> 01:26:33,530
okay,
well let's talk about what that is and

1904
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:34,820
what may be it can do.
And,

1905
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:39,620
um,
so people are seeking the treatment.

1906
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:42,350
It's available.
Um,

1907
01:26:42,410 --> 01:26:44,330
but we don't know and we don't have a
lot of information.

1908
01:26:44,331 --> 01:26:45,740
So we just have to be forthcoming and
say,

1909
01:26:45,741 --> 01:26:47,060
look,
this is experimental.

1910
01:26:47,330 --> 01:26:51,200
We've had encouraging early results.
I can tell you anecdotal stuff.

1911
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:53,900
We've even seen images where somebody
had,

1912
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:56,570
you know,
full thickness rotator cuff tear eight

1913
01:26:56,571 --> 01:26:59,390
months later,
what looked like a healed rotator cuff

1914
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:01,910
on an MRI.
Now,

1915
01:27:01,940 --> 01:27:03,710
did that happen on its own?
Well,

1916
01:27:03,711 --> 01:27:05,780
we know that that happens at a lower
percentage,

1917
01:27:05,781 --> 01:27:09,080
but it is possible to heal.
It's just a lower percentage.

1918
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:12,110
Um,
did it happen because of the treatment,

1919
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:13,610
you know,
that hasn't been established.

1920
01:27:13,970 --> 01:27:18,230
So I have to really explain all that.
And the other category to that,

1921
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:20,570
uh,
patients will come in and they'll

1922
01:27:20,571 --> 01:27:25,250
explain an injury and,
and I've had to turn away a lot of

1923
01:27:25,251 --> 01:27:27,920
people that were,
they were fully ready to come in and

1924
01:27:28,070 --> 01:27:31,430
have treatment and,
and they were fine with paying out of

1925
01:27:31,431 --> 01:27:35,210
pocket because of course,
it's not covered by insurance because

1926
01:27:35,211 --> 01:27:37,400
it's experimental because there's,
you know,

1927
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:39,320
no data yet.
And that's not true.

1928
01:27:39,321 --> 01:27:40,790
There's not no data,
but there's,

1929
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:45,020
there's not enough data to support
treatment for certain,

1930
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:46,430
uh,
conditions.

1931
01:27:47,090 --> 01:27:49,910
Um,
but you know,

1932
01:27:49,911 --> 01:27:53,150
I've had to tell people I don't think
this is appropriate even even to try

1933
01:27:53,151 --> 01:27:54,930
even if you want this.
Um,

1934
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:59,950
and usually the category is,
excuse me if it's something mechanical.

1935
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:04,430
So I think this makes intuitive sense to
people.

1936
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:07,310
So for example,
had you come to me and you said,

1937
01:28:07,311 --> 01:28:08,144
hey,
uh,

1938
01:28:08,210 --> 01:28:11,480
you know,
I dislocated my shoulder seven times and

1939
01:28:11,481 --> 01:28:13,430
uh,
can you just put an injection in their

1940
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:15,013
will?
The,

1941
01:28:15,070 --> 01:28:18,530
the problem with that is that the,
in that case,

1942
01:28:18,531 --> 01:28:21,200
in this example,
the ligaments of the shoulder had been

1943
01:28:21,201 --> 01:28:24,770
stretched and disrupted.
And in the case of a dislocation,

1944
01:28:24,771 --> 01:28:27,380
there's oftentimes a labral tear that
comes with that.

1945
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:30,760
Now,
I don't believe in,

1946
01:28:30,770 --> 01:28:34,370
I could be proven wrong over time,
but I just don't believe that that an

1947
01:28:34,371 --> 01:28:39,371
injection on its own would magically
decreased the volume of the capsule.

1948
01:28:40,130 --> 01:28:42,620
You know,
tightened the static structures in the

1949
01:28:42,621 --> 01:28:45,740
shoulder and resolve the pain for that
patient now.

1950
01:28:45,741 --> 01:28:49,140
But those right there was in my head.
Sure.

1951
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:53,330
I believe there was something that came
up a few years ago where they were doing

1952
01:28:53,331 --> 01:28:57,000
something where they're heating up the
insulation or capsule and shrink the

1953
01:28:57,001 --> 01:28:58,130
normal capsulorrhaphy.

1954
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:01,520
What does that was very popular for you
was,

1955
01:29:01,550 --> 01:29:03,720
yeah,
now it's close to malpractice.

1956
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:04,441
Oh,
Jesus.

1957
01:29:04,441 --> 01:29:06,930
Yeah.
So it's interesting though,

1958
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:11,640
the way these things go.
So there was a huge wave of,

1959
01:29:11,690 --> 01:29:13,920
um,
interest in this.

1960
01:29:13,921 --> 01:29:16,680
And essentially what guys would do is
they're looking inside the shoulder.

1961
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:20,430
You have a radio frequency wand and
you're using that to heat the tissue and

1962
01:29:20,431 --> 01:29:22,710
you can watch it literally shrink in
front of you.

1963
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:28,340
And then Richard Hawkins is a very
accomplished orthopedic surgeon,

1964
01:29:28,381 --> 01:29:30,930
kind of iconic guy that's done tons of
research.

1965
01:29:30,931 --> 01:29:33,720
He was also went in Vail,
Colorado,

1966
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:37,280
now in Carolina,
and he published a paper that,

1967
01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:40,560
that showed a very high rate of failure
from these procedures.

1968
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:43,300
And so as a result of that,
um,

1969
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:46,240
it's fallen out of favor.
So yeah.

1970
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:49,620
But it was done very frequently on lots
and lots of shoulders,

1971
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,510
a high rate of failure.

1972
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:53,430
It was like 40%.
Okay.

1973
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:55,710
But here's the question,
is that because you're,

1974
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:58,200
you're talking about already compromised
joints,

1975
01:29:58,410 --> 01:30:00,090
right?
Which is a very complicated joint.

1976
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:04,140
The shoulder is very complicated.
So there's certainly a number of reasons

1977
01:30:04,141 --> 01:30:05,640
why that could have failed.
But,

1978
01:30:05,850 --> 01:30:08,550
uh,
there was a lot of problems with,

1979
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:11,970
uh,
basically damage to the tissue from the

1980
01:30:11,971 --> 01:30:13,950
radio frequency.
Oh,

1981
01:30:13,951 --> 01:30:16,230
so it was weakening things?
Yeah,

1982
01:30:16,830 --> 01:30:18,360
I say yeah.
So that,

1983
01:30:18,810 --> 01:30:20,760
that what was the benefit of it?
Well,

1984
01:30:20,761 --> 01:30:23,610
you could watch it and you were seeing
the decrease in the volume of the

1985
01:30:23,611 --> 01:30:26,160
capsule.
So you are where structures had become

1986
01:30:26,161 --> 01:30:29,910
loose.
You were seeing it become tight in at

1987
01:30:29,911 --> 01:30:33,840
the time zero period.
What about doing that in conjunction

1988
01:30:33,841 --> 01:30:37,720
with some sort of a stem cell therapy?
Um,

1989
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:40,050
does that make sense?
Yeah.

1990
01:30:40,051 --> 01:30:41,070
It must be a doctor.
Right?

1991
01:30:41,670 --> 01:30:43,800
You're very close.
You know,

1992
01:30:44,290 --> 01:30:47,430
you're only a 10 years in school.

1993
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:49,530
The only 14 years away.
14.

1994
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:51,660
Yeah,
that's all 14 for regular people.

1995
01:30:51,661 --> 01:30:53,240
Give me 20.
Um,

1996
01:30:53,670 --> 01:30:57,180
so,
so why did they think that it would work

1997
01:30:57,181 --> 01:30:58,200
in the first place?
Like what,

1998
01:30:58,201 --> 01:30:59,100
what was the,
uh,

1999
01:30:59,101 --> 01:31:00,900
the idea behind there?
There's,

2000
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:05,400
there's early published papers that were
saying that the outcomes were better if

2001
01:31:05,401 --> 01:31:06,580
you used it.
Wow.

2002
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:08,460
So it's,
it's murky.

2003
01:31:08,461 --> 01:31:11,880
I mean there's things that over time we
discover that what we thought we were

2004
01:31:11,881 --> 01:31:12,960
looking at,
you know,

2005
01:31:12,961 --> 01:31:15,360
we didn't fully understand.
And how long did it take before it

2006
01:31:15,361 --> 01:31:19,440
became malpractice or that problem and
exaggerated term problematic?

2007
01:31:19,470 --> 01:31:20,290
Um,
I,

2008
01:31:20,290 --> 01:31:23,070
I don't know the exact year that his
paper was published,

2009
01:31:23,071 --> 01:31:25,140
but it was,
um,

2010
01:31:25,530 --> 01:31:28,650
it was before my residency training.
I started,

2011
01:31:28,651 --> 01:31:33,540
I graduated medical school in 2006 so it
was before that that people weren't

2012
01:31:33,690 --> 01:31:34,860
doing that anymore.
Okay.

2013
01:31:34,861 --> 01:31:35,910
So I'll bring it back around.

2014
01:31:35,910 --> 01:31:39,660
So when someone has had,
like if you talk to some due to play

2015
01:31:39,661 --> 01:31:42,540
football or something,
had multiple shoulder dislocations,

2016
01:31:42,541 --> 01:31:44,820
like what would you do to,
when you would encourage surgery?

2017
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:48,180
Um,
so the,

2018
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:50,070
you know,
the typical

2019
01:31:51,570 --> 01:31:56,570
course for recurrent instability of the
shoulder would be a stabilization

2020
01:31:57,151 --> 01:32:00,850
procedure.
Now a lot of that's based on the exam

2021
01:32:00,851 --> 01:32:04,900
and what you see on imaging.
Some people can do well with a simple

2022
01:32:04,901 --> 01:32:07,450
shoulder arthroscopy and then you pass a
couple stitches,

2023
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:10,300
you repair the labor from,
you can tighten the capsule at the same

2024
01:32:10,301 --> 01:32:13,060
time.
And young patients progressed really

2025
01:32:13,061 --> 01:32:15,910
well through that.
Um,

2026
01:32:16,090 --> 01:32:18,640
when there is,
you know,

2027
01:32:18,670 --> 01:32:23,470
more complicated problems such as the,
there's bone loss on the front of the

2028
01:32:23,471 --> 01:32:26,020
socket.
So when you have a dislocation,

2029
01:32:26,021 --> 01:32:27,700
the head goes forward.
It,

2030
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:31,990
it goes out the front.
That's the typical and anterior shoulder

2031
01:32:31,991 --> 01:32:36,040
dislocation is the usual one.
And then as it tries to come back into

2032
01:32:36,041 --> 01:32:39,400
place,
the head bangs into the glenoid or the

2033
01:32:39,401 --> 01:32:41,380
socket.
So you can,

2034
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:43,280
you'll tear the front of the Labor.
I'm,

2035
01:32:43,281 --> 01:32:46,870
you'll stretch the front of the capsule,
but then you can also get a dent in the

2036
01:32:46,871 --> 01:32:51,871
back of the humeral head.
So the correct procedure,

2037
01:32:52,350 --> 01:32:52,850
um,
I,

2038
01:32:52,850 --> 01:32:56,030
I keep throwing you off track,
but when someone does have a shoulder

2039
01:32:56,031 --> 01:32:58,010
dislocation,
what are you supposed to do?

2040
01:32:58,020 --> 01:32:59,840
He supposed to pull on it and just take
him to the hospital.

2041
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:04,980
Um,
there's probably no harm in doing that.

2042
01:33:04,981 --> 01:33:07,530
There's,
there's a great technique called the

2043
01:33:07,531 --> 01:33:09,670
Zahiri technique.
Spell it.

2044
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:10,491
Z,
a,

2045
01:33:10,491 --> 01:33:13,080
H I,
R I and it's just the name of the guy

2046
01:33:13,081 --> 01:33:14,820
that wrote the paper.
Um,

2047
01:33:14,850 --> 01:33:17,520
but it's essentially,
it would be a really easy thing for you

2048
01:33:17,521 --> 01:33:19,200
learn cause it's kind of a leverage
thing.

2049
01:33:20,190 --> 01:33:22,980
Yeah.
So it's a way to,

2050
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,280
um,
leverage the,

2051
01:33:25,550 --> 01:33:28,710
the arm so that you can get the muscles
to relax.

2052
01:33:28,711 --> 01:33:33,240
It's easy on the person and you can
actually do it awake and like at the

2053
01:33:33,241 --> 01:33:36,930
field.
So I actually did it on a,

2054
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:37,833
uh,
uh,

2055
01:33:37,890 --> 01:33:40,310
professional steer wrestler,
um,

2056
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:41,700
at the Rodeo.

2057
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:47,060
How hilarious is it that you can be a
professional steer wrestler like the

2058
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:48,410
Seattle Sandwich

2059
01:33:48,410 --> 01:33:50,150
for a few years,
but yeah,

2060
01:33:50,270 --> 01:33:51,050
no,
there,

2061
01:33:51,050 --> 01:33:52,970
there's,
they're pretty serious about stuff.

2062
01:33:52,971 --> 01:33:55,310
Super serious.
You were talking about you're a bucket

2063
01:33:55,311 --> 01:33:58,430
handle meniscus.
The first Rodeo cowboy that I took care

2064
01:33:58,431 --> 01:34:01,220
of had a flipped bucket handle meniscus
tear,

2065
01:34:01,910 --> 01:34:05,810
and he came in the,
the day that the national finals Rodeo

2066
01:34:05,811 --> 01:34:08,840
was starting and he was also a steer
wrestler by the way.

2067
01:34:08,841 --> 01:34:11,670
And had been a previous,
I think he was a champ or he,

2068
01:34:11,690 --> 01:34:13,010
he won a bunch,
that's for sure.

2069
01:34:13,490 --> 01:34:15,710
Um,
so they basically,

2070
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:17,680
they taped his knee.
You got to come closer.

2071
01:34:17,930 --> 01:34:19,580
They taped his knee,
you know,

2072
01:34:19,730 --> 01:34:24,730
in about 30 degrees of flection and he
competed the whole nine days.

2073
01:34:25,670 --> 01:34:27,980
Whoa.
Just roped up knee.

2074
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:31,850
Just taped it up,
got on his horse and was jumping off and

2075
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:35,180
throwing 600 pounds steers on the
ground.

2076
01:34:35,190 --> 01:34:36,680
Forest.
Yeah.

2077
01:34:36,710 --> 01:34:39,590
Those guys are crazy.
I want to see stuff on TV.

2078
01:34:39,591 --> 01:34:41,690
I've never even been to one live because
I'm terrified.

2079
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:43,880
You need to come to,
I don't,

2080
01:34:43,881 --> 01:34:47,730
we did an episode of fear factor.
We may people ride bulls made him write

2081
01:34:47,731 --> 01:34:48,564
it.
That's,

2082
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:50,190
that's you can die.
I mean that's not,

2083
01:34:50,191 --> 01:34:52,880
it's dying no matter what.
You're dealing with a goddamn steer.

2084
01:34:52,970 --> 01:34:54,530
That's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm saying.

2085
01:34:55,010 --> 01:34:56,930
You can die.
Getting on top of the stairs is not a

2086
01:34:58,310 --> 01:34:59,270
yielded.
Right.

2087
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:02,390
We had bowls steer wrestling is
different.

2088
01:35:02,510 --> 01:35:04,790
Right.
Steer wrestling is the,

2089
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:06,560
they grab him.
They take off.

2090
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,480
Yeah.
You wrote here and the guy and the horse

2091
01:35:08,481 --> 01:35:10,070
take off at the same time.
You jump off,

2092
01:35:10,071 --> 01:35:11,810
you grab it,
you grab it by the horns and turn its

2093
01:35:11,811 --> 01:35:13,710
neck and throw it in the ground and then
they wrapped it.

2094
01:35:13,710 --> 01:35:16,460
Yeah.
See with steer is a bull that doesn't

2095
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:18,290
have any balls,
right?

2096
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:20,140
Yeah,
that polls.

2097
01:35:20,141 --> 01:35:23,250
But the same animal,
they're younger than the ones that they

2098
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:24,950
cop.
They chopped their balls off before they

2099
01:35:24,951 --> 01:35:26,960
get a chance to mature.
That's why when they,

2100
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:28,420
they rules are terrifying.
So,

2101
01:35:28,570 --> 01:35:33,440
and write down next to the bucking chute
and it's like frightening actually had a

2102
01:35:33,441 --> 01:35:36,050
clot of dirt.
Get one of them kicked it up and it hit

2103
01:35:36,051 --> 01:35:37,850
me in the head like a baseball.
I mean,

2104
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:40,820
yeah.
See they're a little babies and they

2105
01:35:40,821 --> 01:35:42,920
have no balls.
So this guy jumps off.

2106
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:43,600
What?
Uh,

2107
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:48,410
and you tell him that is so whack.
What a stupid fucking thing to be

2108
01:35:48,411 --> 01:35:50,420
excited about these ideas.

2109
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:53,450
I'm going to ask what of that thing I
was trying to get away.

2110
01:35:53,451 --> 01:35:56,250
I grab him by his natural handles and
I'd tuck them down.

2111
01:35:56,260 --> 01:35:57,000
Look how quick,

2112
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,940
look at their move.
It's like a darce choke and the cows

2113
01:35:59,941 --> 01:36:01,410
like,
what in the fuck man,

2114
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:03,590
why is this even happening?
Look,

2115
01:36:03,610 --> 01:36:06,980
the cows like what is going on?
I got to get out here and look how they

2116
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:08,730
always do it the same way too.
They do.

2117
01:36:08,790 --> 01:36:11,600
It's it's,
it's similar to like a a chokehold.

2118
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:12,840
Yeah.
Oh,

2119
01:36:12,841 --> 01:36:17,350
what a dumb fucking thing to be excited
about the neck and flip them on their

2120
01:36:17,370 --> 01:36:19,170
backs.
Not It's outside of your world,

2121
01:36:19,171 --> 01:36:23,370
but I'll tell you outside of the world,
these are some of the nicest guys I've

2122
01:36:23,371 --> 01:36:24,960
ever met in my life,
honestly,

2123
01:36:24,990 --> 01:36:26,790
and there are some of the toughest
athletes.

2124
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:28,890
Oh yeah.
I would imagine those guys are tough as

2125
01:36:28,891 --> 01:36:29,970
hell.
You have to be,

2126
01:36:30,090 --> 01:36:32,730
they got to do it on fearful pete
through every injury.

2127
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:35,910
There is no injury that they don't,
that they won't compete.

2128
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:37,710
You're always broken up.
I mean,

2129
01:36:37,711 --> 01:36:39,040
you have to.
We have to do it on food.

2130
01:36:39,041 --> 01:36:40,800
Also.
They've had nine don't make money if

2131
01:36:40,801 --> 01:36:42,810
they're not competing,
so right.

2132
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:46,350
We have to do it on fear factor was a
steer champion or a Rodeo champion

2133
01:36:46,351 --> 01:36:48,300
rather.
He had nine shoulder surgeries,

2134
01:36:48,301 --> 01:36:51,260
his shoulder was just like sliced all
open and he,

2135
01:36:51,270 --> 01:36:53,120
I don't know how long off it has a
dislocated,

2136
01:36:53,121 --> 01:36:56,070
he goes,
get me anytime I could open up a car

2137
01:36:56,071 --> 01:36:57,210
door,
it will pop out of socket.

2138
01:36:57,230 --> 01:36:58,890
I'm like,
yikes.

2139
01:36:59,160 --> 01:36:59,940
Yeah,
it's bad.

2140
01:36:59,940 --> 01:37:01,560
Yeah.
Um,

2141
01:37:01,590 --> 01:37:04,980
so back around to where we're at.
What,

2142
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:07,020
um,
what do you do?

2143
01:37:07,170 --> 01:37:10,800
How does this xy here technique?
Can you describe it?

2144
01:37:11,260 --> 01:37:13,980
That I say right is that hearing Tahirih
Erie techniques.

2145
01:37:13,981 --> 01:37:18,981
So that one of the guys that we trained
with a in are my sports medicine program

2146
01:37:19,860 --> 01:37:24,720
and Alabama showed us this and um,
it was like one of the first things that

2147
01:37:24,721 --> 01:37:26,100
we reviewed at the beginning of the
year.

2148
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:29,100
And uh,
so basically you have the person lying

2149
01:37:29,101 --> 01:37:34,101
flat on their back and I would hold your
wrist and then I loop my arm under your

2150
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:39,690
arm and then grab onto mine for
leverage.

2151
01:37:40,140 --> 01:37:44,520
And then I literally just sort of lean
back and I'm using the muscles in my

2152
01:37:44,521 --> 01:37:48,570
back so I'm not pulling with my arms.
So a small person can do this on a very

2153
01:37:48,571 --> 01:37:51,240
big athlete and you're fine because
you're,

2154
01:37:51,270 --> 01:37:53,700
you're using all of the strongest
muscles in your body,

2155
01:37:53,820 --> 01:37:56,220
right?
So you literally just

2156
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:59,790
lean back and you hold traction in that
position.

2157
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:01,650
So you've got the arm is positioned like
this.

2158
01:38:01,670 --> 01:38:03,210
Yeah.
You got to describe to people that are

2159
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:04,400
listening.
Uh,

2160
01:38:04,410 --> 01:38:06,890
the arm is in front of the person,
uh,

2161
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:08,610
while they're laying,
laying on their back.

2162
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:12,780
And again,
I have my right hand on your right

2163
01:38:12,781 --> 01:38:14,610
wrist.
If it's a right shoulder dislocation,

2164
01:38:14,690 --> 01:38:15,680
well,
let's just see a video.

2165
01:38:15,710 --> 01:38:16,850
You got to,
you got a video of it.

2166
01:38:17,170 --> 01:38:20,060
It's really hard to find him,
but I'm going to hopefully guests that

2167
01:38:20,061 --> 01:38:22,130
this is maybe it,
hopefully.

2168
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:23,210
Yeah.
Okay.

2169
01:38:23,420 --> 01:38:26,690
Let me explain to people at home what
this is like as if you were trying to

2170
01:38:26,691 --> 01:38:28,370
give someone an armbar.
You,

2171
01:38:28,371 --> 01:38:31,040
it's,
you get a hook on the left side and so

2172
01:38:31,041 --> 01:38:32,590
the hook is a,
your left,

2173
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:34,580
if you're trying to arm bar someone on
the right,

2174
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:37,010
the right arm,
and you were inside control,

2175
01:38:37,210 --> 01:38:40,910
you would hook it with your left arm and
then you would trap it in place.

2176
01:38:40,911 --> 01:38:43,340
And what a person does when they don't
want to get arm barred,

2177
01:38:43,630 --> 01:38:46,490
their defense is this,
they grabbed their hands together and so

2178
01:38:46,491 --> 01:38:49,820
you loop your arm in that and pull it
back like that.

2179
01:38:49,821 --> 01:38:51,800
So that'd be real similar what you're
doing,

2180
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:55,400
you're using the left arm,
you're kind of connecting it like this

2181
01:38:55,490 --> 01:38:58,310
and then you're,
you're actually just using traction.

2182
01:38:58,370 --> 01:38:59,510
Yeah.
So the,

2183
01:38:59,810 --> 01:39:03,140
the treater in this case on the right
side,

2184
01:39:03,690 --> 01:39:08,460
he just going to lean back and hold and
you just wait and in about 10 seconds

2185
01:39:08,510 --> 01:39:12,000
pops in place,
the deltoid and the pack and the biceps

2186
01:39:12,001 --> 01:39:14,040
relax and it just slides in.
Oh,

2187
01:39:14,620 --> 01:39:16,380
that's interesting.
And you can actually do that.

2188
01:39:16,950 --> 01:39:20,700
And I mean the kinder way to do this as
you know,

2189
01:39:20,701 --> 01:39:24,190
with some anesthesia,
but a lot of times you can do that and

2190
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:28,800
they're perfectly comfortable in there.
Immediately better on the shoulders back

2191
01:39:28,801 --> 01:39:31,650
in,
while they're not completely better,

2192
01:39:31,651 --> 01:39:33,900
but the pain is relieved from the
initial event.

2193
01:39:34,210 --> 01:39:36,970
Now you told me when you looked at my
Mri that you think that my shoulder was

2194
01:39:37,210 --> 01:39:38,710
dislocated at some point in time.

2195
01:39:38,940 --> 01:39:43,200
I don't remember it exactly your Mri,
but if you had a tear of the front of

2196
01:39:43,201 --> 01:39:44,340
the Labor Room,
if you had,

2197
01:39:44,341 --> 01:39:47,520
and you had that,
any evidence of that little dent in the

2198
01:39:47,521 --> 01:39:52,200
back of the humeral head and then that
would be consistent with that.

2199
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:55,110
I just do not remember ever having a
dislocated shoulder,

2200
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:58,830
but I've had,
I've been Kamora you've had a bunch of

2201
01:39:58,831 --> 01:40:01,500
times that you've had it slip maybe a
little bit.

2202
01:40:02,130 --> 01:40:03,870
Well,
when just the nature of your shoulder

2203
01:40:03,871 --> 01:40:05,250
locked,
you know,

2204
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:10,260
there's been a many American as in my
past and Maura's and all these different

2205
01:40:10,261 --> 01:40:12,060
like hardcore,
you know,

2206
01:40:12,061 --> 01:40:13,790
the thing is we're on the receiving end.
Yeah,

2207
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:16,830
yeah.
Before this injury,

2208
01:40:16,831 --> 01:40:19,140
I never,
Americana you could definitely have at

2209
01:40:19,141 --> 01:40:21,330
least a subluxation of the shoulder for
sure.

2210
01:40:21,331 --> 01:40:22,560
I'm sure.
I'm sure.

2211
01:40:22,561 --> 01:40:24,870
And you fight it off too because you
don't want it to happen.

2212
01:40:24,871 --> 01:40:27,130
So you're resisting.
And um,

2213
01:40:27,540 --> 01:40:30,090
before this injury,
I didn't do any shoulder exercises.

2214
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:33,360
I just worked out,
but I didn't do any specific exercises

2215
01:40:33,361 --> 01:40:36,090
just to strengthen my shoulders.
And I think that was a big mistake.

2216
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:41,310
And I kind of emphasize that with people
like doing a external and internal

2217
01:40:41,311 --> 01:40:42,770
rotation,
um,

2218
01:40:42,930 --> 01:40:45,550
exercises doing like,
um,

2219
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:50,010
I'm a big fan now of a inverted
kettlebell presses and yeah,

2220
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:52,250
that's what had been one of my,
a giant right.

2221
01:40:52,251 --> 01:40:54,010
My favorite lately.
It's definitely a challenge.

2222
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:56,500
You don't need much weight and uh,
yeah,

2223
01:40:56,501 --> 01:40:59,050
this little 40 pound iron man
Kettlebell,

2224
01:40:59,051 --> 01:41:00,910
I use this one.
It's amazing.

2225
01:41:02,430 --> 01:41:03,820
That exercise.
That's pretty good.

2226
01:41:04,270 --> 01:41:05,410
Well,
it's just a,

2227
01:41:05,740 --> 01:41:10,740
they say you should be able to do 50% of
your Max weight or is that 50% or 90% I

2228
01:41:12,341 --> 01:41:14,140
forget what they say.
I forget me.

2229
01:41:14,290 --> 01:41:15,101
Don't listen to me.
Well,

2230
01:41:15,101 --> 01:41:17,890
it,
it depends on,

2231
01:41:17,950 --> 01:41:19,210
I think I said 90.
Yeah.

2232
01:41:19,390 --> 01:41:22,660
Obviously in the,
in the injured patient or the person

2233
01:41:22,661 --> 01:41:24,730
that's recovering,
we're going to be starting with much

2234
01:41:24,731 --> 01:41:25,750
lower,
much lower,

2235
01:41:25,770 --> 01:41:28,350
much lower,
but focus is on your motion,

2236
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:30,100
your,
your posture,

2237
01:41:30,101 --> 01:41:32,580
engaging your core,
keeping your ribs down in,

2238
01:41:32,670 --> 01:41:35,800
in having the full motion.
The strong first protocol.

2239
01:41:35,830 --> 01:41:39,940
I think what they're trying to say is in
order to have really powerful shoulders,

2240
01:41:39,941 --> 01:41:43,750
you should be able to do 90% of your Max
Kettlebell press.

2241
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:47,050
Like say if you can Max Kettle press 90
pounds.

2242
01:41:47,110 --> 01:41:50,410
Now that's with the,
with the handle down,

2243
01:41:50,411 --> 01:41:51,460
build down.
Right.

2244
01:41:51,550 --> 01:41:52,270
Okay.
Yeah.

2245
01:41:52,270 --> 01:41:53,830
All right.
With Max,

2246
01:41:53,831 --> 01:41:56,080
that would be your Max.
Like what you go with one rep Max.

2247
01:41:56,081 --> 01:41:57,430
Yes.
Or you know what,

2248
01:41:57,431 --> 01:42:00,240
you would pretty much be,
you,

2249
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:02,170
maybe you could do two or three if you
really had to,

2250
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:04,150
but you know,
you're talking about a lot of weight.

2251
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:05,970
Um,
the,

2252
01:42:05,980 --> 01:42:09,190
you know what you would normally like
Max out at like there's,

2253
01:42:09,191 --> 01:42:11,350
um,
there's a protocol that this guy,

2254
01:42:11,351 --> 01:42:14,880
Pavel Tatsu lean follows.
That's really kind of interesting in,

2255
01:42:14,881 --> 01:42:15,581
you know,
Pavel,

2256
01:42:15,581 --> 01:42:15,971
right?
Well,

2257
01:42:15,971 --> 01:42:17,350
he's the Kettle Bell Guy,
right?

2258
01:42:17,470 --> 01:42:19,510
He's the guy that brought him,
they call him the godfather of

2259
01:42:19,511 --> 01:42:21,190
kettlebells and America.
But um,

2260
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:23,410
the guy that I trained with talks about
that all the time.

2261
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:24,370
Yeah.
The,

2262
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:26,410
the idea behind it is,
um,

2263
01:42:27,070 --> 01:42:30,010
don't do your,
like if you could do 10 reps,

2264
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:34,800
you do five and you wait a long time and
then you do another five and you wait a

2265
01:42:34,801 --> 01:42:37,150
long time,
then you do another five and he never

2266
01:42:37,151 --> 01:42:37,984
worked a failure.

2267
01:42:38,230 --> 01:42:40,750
And that working to failure is actually
not healthy.

2268
01:42:40,751 --> 01:42:43,780
It's not smart and you don't really get
stronger that way would be my

2269
01:42:43,781 --> 01:42:47,380
recommendation is that for,
and,

2270
01:42:47,510 --> 01:42:49,240
and,
and this is coming from not,

2271
01:42:49,270 --> 01:42:51,280
this isn't from the orthopedic surgery
world.

2272
01:42:51,281 --> 01:42:53,620
This is what I've read from strength and
conditioning people.

2273
01:42:54,610 --> 01:42:59,610
The thing you want to avoid in doing
something to failure is with load in a

2274
01:42:59,801 --> 01:43:03,070
skill activity.
So for example,

2275
01:43:03,071 --> 01:43:08,071
like a clean or a snatch or something.
Things that involve coordination.

2276
01:43:08,910 --> 01:43:10,870
Yeah.
And where you have to time it requires,

2277
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:12,670
you know,
sound mechanics,

2278
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:14,290
right.
And you're doing it with load.

2279
01:43:14,770 --> 01:43:19,180
It's bad to do that to failure because
what happens as you fatigue is your

2280
01:43:19,181 --> 01:43:20,510
mechanics are going to break down,
right?

2281
01:43:20,530 --> 01:43:21,880
That's where you're gonna get hurt.
Well,

2282
01:43:21,881 --> 01:43:26,881
what Pavel talks about is that strength
as a skill and that all these different

2283
01:43:27,341 --> 01:43:30,190
things,
think of them as a skill and then don't

2284
01:43:30,191 --> 01:43:31,240
do things to failure.

2285
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:34,060
And if you're looking for,
you know,

2286
01:43:34,061 --> 01:43:36,370
endurance or something along those
lines,

2287
01:43:36,371 --> 01:43:40,270
you want to do light weights and you do
want to do multiple repetitions is not

2288
01:43:40,271 --> 01:43:41,890
what you're doing when you're trying to
get stronger.

2289
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:43,330
No.
Yeah.

2290
01:43:43,330 --> 01:43:44,410
So it's,
there's a,

2291
01:43:44,411 --> 01:43:45,250
but there's,
you know,

2292
01:43:45,251 --> 01:43:47,890
a lot of different arguments one way or
another.

2293
01:43:47,891 --> 01:43:49,420
I mean,
talk to power lifters and they're like,

2294
01:43:49,421 --> 01:43:51,410
that guy's a pleasure.
You got to do it to failure.

2295
01:43:52,150 --> 01:43:53,030
Yeah.
I Dunno.

2296
01:43:53,970 --> 01:43:56,300
Talk to crossfit people.
They want to do 100 reps,

2297
01:43:56,510 --> 01:43:57,960
you know,
no.

2298
01:43:58,030 --> 01:44:00,260
There,
there are activities that you can train

2299
01:44:00,261 --> 01:44:03,110
to failure and there's no risk.
So for example,

2300
01:44:03,111 --> 01:44:04,580
like,
like pull ups,

2301
01:44:05,270 --> 01:44:06,200
I mean,
when you fail,

2302
01:44:06,201 --> 01:44:07,640
you just,
you just can't get up.

2303
01:44:07,641 --> 01:44:07,970
Right?
Right.

2304
01:44:07,970 --> 01:44:10,160
Like you just going to come off the bar,
right.

2305
01:44:10,490 --> 01:44:13,720
The battle ropes,
you just going to fatigue out like there

2306
01:44:13,721 --> 01:44:15,240
is,
you're not going to hurt yourself,

2307
01:44:15,241 --> 01:44:15,440
right.

2308
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:18,050
Do they even believed that when you're
doing chin ups,

2309
01:44:18,110 --> 01:44:19,580
like if you're doing pull ups or Chin
ups,

2310
01:44:19,930 --> 01:44:22,010
um,
that when you're doing it,

2311
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:24,560
you shouldn't go to failure.
You should just stop,

2312
01:44:24,650 --> 01:44:29,090
like close to it or halfway there and
then take a long time off and then do

2313
01:44:29,091 --> 01:44:31,000
another five reps.
Like say if your,

2314
01:44:31,001 --> 01:44:33,770
your Max is 10 reps,
get to five,

2315
01:44:33,830 --> 01:44:35,780
stop,
take a break,

2316
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:38,960
do another five stop,
take another five,

2317
01:44:38,961 --> 01:44:40,310
10 minutes,
do another five,

2318
01:44:40,430 --> 01:44:45,430
keep going and just you're,
you're working on form and your muscles

2319
01:44:46,311 --> 01:44:49,550
are performing these actions in a very
clean,

2320
01:44:49,551 --> 01:44:54,551
smooth delivery and that this is the
best way to recover or to build strength

2321
01:44:54,591 --> 01:44:57,980
and that you just do it more often.
Don't do it to failure once a week and

2322
01:44:57,981 --> 01:45:00,530
then be a wreck for like three or four
days afterwards.

2323
01:45:00,531 --> 01:45:03,260
Because you know that feeling when you,
when you lift weights and you lift

2324
01:45:03,261 --> 01:45:06,650
weights for a week or you lift weights
and you lift weights to failure rather,

2325
01:45:06,860 --> 01:45:09,920
and you're sore for so long,
you can't get anything done.

2326
01:45:10,370 --> 01:45:15,370
This idea is you do more frequent
workouts and you don't go to failure but

2327
01:45:17,121 --> 01:45:22,121
don't go over five Reps.
I think one of the biggest mistakes that

2328
01:45:22,461 --> 01:45:25,580
we see in reasons that people show up in
my office,

2329
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:31,300
it is because of overload and you know,
no time for recovery,

2330
01:45:32,510 --> 01:45:34,280
right.
From the training that you're doing.

2331
01:45:34,281 --> 01:45:38,930
So you don't see people period ising and
incorporating the times when they're

2332
01:45:38,931 --> 01:45:40,190
just allowing rest.
I mean,

2333
01:45:40,191 --> 01:45:44,390
you can't be working at Max capacity all
the time.

2334
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:45,411
Right.
Exactly.

2335
01:45:45,411 --> 01:45:48,200
So that's a big thing with fighters.
Huge.

2336
01:45:48,330 --> 01:45:51,410
Yeah.
Keeping them for working hard is so hard

2337
01:45:51,411 --> 01:45:52,400
to do.
Yeah.

2338
01:45:52,401 --> 01:45:55,190
So I always,
I try to emphasize with [inaudible] and

2339
01:45:55,191 --> 01:45:58,490
we have to really talk about this with
our acl rehab.

2340
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:00,470
Um,
because that's a group that,

2341
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:02,510
you know,
they're so eager to get back,

2342
01:46:03,110 --> 01:46:05,330
you know,
if they're a competitive athlete that,

2343
01:46:05,390 --> 01:46:06,770
you know,
you got to remind them that,

2344
01:46:06,771 --> 01:46:08,360
look,
we have steps to go through.

2345
01:46:08,620 --> 01:46:09,920
And I always say,
you got to work smart.

2346
01:46:09,921 --> 01:46:10,820
Not Hard.
Like,

2347
01:46:11,380 --> 01:46:13,670
you know,
we have a plan and there's a reason why

2348
01:46:13,671 --> 01:46:18,470
this week may not be a whole lot of work
and your body needs rest and recovery in

2349
01:46:18,471 --> 01:46:22,730
order to put stress on it again so that
we can continue to make your progress.

2350
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:24,650
Otherwise,
at some point you're either going to

2351
01:46:24,651 --> 01:46:26,440
plateau,
you're not going to be making changes,

2352
01:46:26,441 --> 01:46:28,850
you're gonna get frustrated or you're
just going to get hurt.

2353
01:46:28,940 --> 01:46:29,930
Right.
All right,

2354
01:46:29,931 --> 01:46:32,780
we got to bring this home.
So anything else we need to,

2355
01:46:32,781 --> 01:46:35,000
uh,
cover on this?

2356
01:46:35,001 --> 01:46:36,050
I think so.
I think we got,

2357
01:46:36,230 --> 01:46:37,940
we got to talk about quite a bit.
Yeah,

2358
01:46:37,941 --> 01:46:39,530
we really did.
Thank you very much for doing this.

2359
01:46:39,531 --> 01:46:42,050
I really appreciate it because this is,
we've always had these really cool

2360
01:46:42,051 --> 01:46:43,790
conversations when a visit you in your
office.

2361
01:46:43,791 --> 01:46:45,740
And I'm really glad we got a chance to
do this.

2362
01:46:45,950 --> 01:46:47,840
Now,
if people want to get ahold of you and

2363
01:46:47,841 --> 01:46:51,210
they want to seek treatment,
please give them a necessary

2364
01:46:51,211 --> 01:46:52,110
information.
Oh,

2365
01:46:52,111 --> 01:46:53,940
sure.
So our website is

2366
01:46:53,970 --> 01:46:58,970
www.totalsportsmedicine.com.
I like how people still say www,

2367
01:46:59,670 --> 01:47:00,660
like,
yeah.

2368
01:47:00,690 --> 01:47:01,920
Like I still get there,
right?

2369
01:47:02,190 --> 01:47:04,380
Yeah,
you can just total sports medicine.com.

2370
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:05,790
Yeah.
Um,

2371
01:47:06,150 --> 01:47:07,260
and then,
uh,

2372
01:47:07,890 --> 01:47:11,790
we have information on there in terms of
how to contact us and,

2373
01:47:11,791 --> 01:47:12,200
uh,
you know,

2374
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:15,060
we'd be happy to get additional
information to patients if they have

2375
01:47:15,061 --> 01:47:16,110
questions.
Awesome.

2376
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:17,430
Well,
again,

2377
01:47:17,460 --> 01:47:18,690
thanks for everything you've done for
me.

2378
01:47:18,691 --> 01:47:20,670
It's been a lifesaver and,
uh,

2379
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:23,580
