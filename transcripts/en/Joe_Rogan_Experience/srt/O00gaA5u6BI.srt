1
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:05,740
Four,
three,

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,570
two,
one.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,790
Hey,
what's going on?

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,660
Hey,
how do I get that quick,

5
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:14,010
quick fix.
Oh my God.

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,620
It's so amazing how fast it came back to
me.

7
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:19,390
Like the addiction of playing that game
over and over again.

8
00:00:19,391 --> 00:00:21,160
That it's a real problem.
Yeah,

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,980
we've been going crazy.
Jamie has been fucking me up to.

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,110
So today I got lucky that he had to help
you get his shit together.

11
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,690
He really killed that.
He's been fucking me up.

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,480
Yeah,
you don't really play quake,

13
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:35,550
right?
You just from playing a fortnight and

14
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:37,320
stuff.
I tested myself a little bit because I

15
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:38,610
knew that this was gonna happen
eventually,

16
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:42,360
so I had to get some practice with some
rockets that at some point and yeah,

17
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,820
but it helped.
It honestly helps to warm up with quake

18
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:47,430
to play for at night or play pub g or
something like that because the quick

19
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,220
whatever it is of aiming,
you don't do it that much.

20
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,840
So like when you're doing it three
times,

21
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:54,450
you've already done it 55 times playing
quake just in one round.

22
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,150
So like your little interaction you have
with someone a shotgun.

23
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,820
Usually when so quick.
It's so fast paced.

24
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,500
Yeah.
We're playing quake for.

25
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,440
It's like
Jesus Christ.

26
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,330
I haven't played that game and maybe 15
years.

27
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:08,790
See Two.
You're ever going to do it again?

28
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,580
I probably shouldn't,
but what I noticed is my eyesight's

29
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:14,310
sucks now.
My eyesight is not nearly as good.

30
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,420
It's interesting.
From 42 to 46,

31
00:01:17,421 --> 00:01:21,270
there was a big dropoff in at 46.
The fucking floor fell out.

32
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,050
Now it's like my eyesight's Shit Gamer
glasses.

33
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,100
It takes me a minute when I play games
to one game isn't enough yet.

34
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:31,110
It probably takes 10 minutes,
maybe less,

35
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:35,730
but like to just start tracking things,
getting your eyes up to speed.

36
00:01:35,731 --> 00:01:37,290
The distance you are away from that
screen.

37
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,330
I'll all.
It takes a little bit of time to get in

38
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:40,290
there.
Yeah,

39
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:41,124
man,
it's,

40
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,430
we're right now we're just playing it on
the local area network.

41
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,130
But uh,
once you start going online and playing

42
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,780
other people,
that's when it gets super,

43
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:51,420
super addictive.
People that still play that game must be

44
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,890
insane.
Oh my God.

45
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:55,710
I don't want to be anywhere near
psychopaths if they're playing that

46
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:57,230
game.
It's because they're really good at it.

47
00:01:57,231 --> 00:01:58,560
Probably,
you know,

48
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,020
like who else?
Like young kids aren't buying that game.

49
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:05,400
Back in the day you even had a Joe Rogan
a level that somebody created.

50
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:07,830
Remember that somebody created a level.
That's right.

51
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,750
Was that what game with three or four?
I think it was for.

52
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,170
Was it really for.
Was 11 though,

53
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,230
didn't it come out in 2011?
Maybe it was three days.

54
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,920
Might have been three wasn't it?
Wasn't rock arena arena for.

55
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,750
I don't know.
Oh my gosh,

56
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,090
I don't remember.
I don't remember.

57
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,490
I know there was rocket arena for quake
two and there was rocket arena for quake

58
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:29,070
three because I started with rocket
arena for quick two,

59
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,890
which have you played today?
You would think the graphics are

60
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:34,590
hilariously bad,
but uh,

61
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,020
it's a good game.
It's a little slower.

62
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,660
The fast game was like quake one was
really fast,

63
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,780
too quick too,
is slower and then quake three became

64
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:46,040
more like quake one combination of quick
one quick to do.

65
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,760
It's pretty fast.
Quick us.

66
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,640
Perfect.
Miss it.

67
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,710
And you tried to play the new quake but
you didn't,

68
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,950
you didn't like it as much as that.
The only problem is it's fun.

69
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,890
We had a good time.
The only problem is you have to do

70
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,310
through their servers.

71
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,410
So it takes time.
It's got a load and it's like,

72
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,410
it's not.
I'm inpatient,

73
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,650
right motherfucking child.
That's crazy.

74
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,000
Yeah.
You,

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,800
you,
you refused to try any of the other

76
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:12,634
ones,
right?

77
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,520
Like they're all just new addictions,
you know,

78
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:18,940
waiting to happen.
I just feel like if I got one addiction,

79
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,230
uh,
this weekend on Saturday,

80
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,630
they had a concert in fortnight.
Yeah,

81
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,340
marshmallow.
It was crazy.

82
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,570
Yeah.
What does that mean?

83
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,390
I think it's tough to explain what they
had.

84
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,020
It's called an event,
what they're calling it.

85
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:35,700
A second event.
So at 2:00 everybody showed up at the

86
00:03:35,701 --> 00:03:40,701
game in this fucking concert started.
It was all the avatars were together,

87
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:43,110
like in one gigantic were normal mode,
you know,

88
00:03:43,111 --> 00:03:46,350
you played at just like normal and then
all of a sudden like two minutes to go.

89
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,250
They took everybody's guns away and like
you all just sort of congregated around

90
00:03:50,251 --> 00:03:53,700
the stage and the music started to show
started.

91
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,640
They started doing interactive things
with all the avatars and everything and

92
00:03:56,641 --> 00:04:00,930
like 10 minutes later just it cut off,
but it turns out it was actually live.

93
00:04:00,931 --> 00:04:02,940
He,
he was tweeting about it all day because

94
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:04,950
for promotion and whatnot.
But people were asking like,

95
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,720
how'd you do that?
How'd you work it out?

96
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,270
His voice was going live to everyone and
was playing.

97
00:04:09,271 --> 00:04:13,590
It was probably millions of people and
it was just normal dj voice stuff like,

98
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,930
hey jump guys.
Hey,

99
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,460
what is it?
They were just like,

100
00:04:17,461 --> 00:04:18,240
hey guys,
come on.

101
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,330
Like he wasn't interacting too much as
much as he probably does during a normal

102
00:04:21,331 --> 00:04:23,990
set when he's playing to 20,000 people
in Vegas or whatever.

103
00:04:23,991 --> 00:04:24,100
Yeah.

104
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,200
So when he does it,
he probably has like a really good

105
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:28,480
microphone to like,
it's not like the microphone that you

106
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:29,820
talk shit on,
right?

107
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,220
Yeah.
Yeah.

108
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,250
They had something else set up yet.
When we first started doing quick known

109
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,140
you had a type.
Yeah,

110
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,670
that's how goofy it was.
You to.

111
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,190
You couldn't talk shit.
Like now people are talking like they're

112
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:41,410
all in a group together talking shit.
Right.

113
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,500
I have a voice changer now too,
but doesn't have talking shit.

114
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,480
Get in the way.
Like if you hear people talking,

115
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:48,640
it gets in the way of hearing.
Sounds like sound cues.

116
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:49,660
Yes.
Yeah.

117
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,950
Tell your teammates shut the fuck up.
You can turn that off also.

118
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,873
Oh,
you can.

119
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,610
I like to hear the footsteps going
around coming around the corner and

120
00:04:55,611 --> 00:04:56,140
stuff.

121
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,390
It's makes it scary.
Yeah.

122
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,520
It's part of what's scary about quake is
like you,

123
00:04:59,521 --> 00:05:02,950
you hear someone running grow and you
know the right around the corner,

124
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,920
you can control all that.
It's all up to you.

125
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,900
Volume settings and all that kind of
very,

126
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:10,720
very addictive game.
So we should talk about this,

127
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,180
uh,
the Jack podcast because everybody got

128
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:16,390
so upset about it and let's clear up a
few things.

129
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:18,850
First of all,
the guy seems to be willing to talk

130
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,490
about anything.
It's not that I didn't want to talk to

131
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,210
about those things is just he was being
a,

132
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,380
I wouldn't say he's evasive,
but it was basically just saying what he

133
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:34,381
knew based on the company policy.
I didn't know what else more to ask him

134
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:39,430
and people felt like I didn't press him
hard enough and he to his credit,

135
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,650
reached out to me and said that he would
offer to do another one to ask more

136
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:45,160
questions.

137
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,540
That's cool.
I said that would be awesome.

138
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,130
So I said,
well,

139
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,050
this is the thing that people seem to be
upset about.

140
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:55,000
It seemed to be upset about very
specific cases where people showed.

141
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,180
I'm like,
if people were right wing and they were

142
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:00,950
posting things,
they were banned.

143
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,160
Whereas people who are left wing or
maybe people of different races or

144
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:11,381
allowed to post racist things or more
offensive things and even docs people

145
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,540
and didn't suffer any consequences for
it.

146
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,860
This is the argument,
my problem is I don't spend enough time

147
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:20,720
reading this stuff.
I don't know.

148
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,330
Like this is like when people get
banned.

149
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,330
Like Anthony Kumi is a friend of mine.
I don't really know why he got banned.

150
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,450
I don't know what happened.
There was that incident with that,

151
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,660
that woman that punched him and he ended
up getting fired.

152
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:36,230
He was drunk and he said a bunch of
really stupid shit on twitter and then

153
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:39,980
later apologized for it,
but I don't know if that's what got him

154
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:40,580
fired.

155
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,500
Kicked off twitter.
But he's my friend.

156
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,620
So what I'm saying is all these other
guys that have problems,

157
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,720
I don't know what the fuck happened,
man.

158
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:49,310
I'm busy.
I really don't.

159
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,310
I don't know.
I don't even know what got Alex Jones

160
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,950
kicked off,
which is why I asked him because that

161
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:58,310
was one of the last platforms for Alex
Jones was twitter,

162
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,670
but something got him kicked off their
take on it was it.

163
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,150
They never kicked him off before because
he didn't violate their terms of

164
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:07,880
service.
And another thing that's very

165
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:10,160
encouraging that Jack said,
and I know it's,

166
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,770
it's fun to get mad at things,
it's fun to get mad at him.

167
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:14,660
It's fun to get mad at me for it.
I get it.

168
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,060
I'd probably do the exact same thing.
I totally understand it,

169
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,840
but one of the things that he said was
that he believes that the ability to

170
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:28,850
communicate on the Internet through
twitter or through these platforms is a

171
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:30,230
basic human right.

172
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,880
That's how he looked.
Like I said,

173
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:35,840
do you think of it like a network like
NBC,

174
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:38,170
like if you're on NBC,
they can decide what's on and what's not

175
00:07:38,171 --> 00:07:41,000
on,
or do you look at it like a utility?

176
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,510
And he specifically said that he looked
at it more like that,

177
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,140
that he thought it was a basic right.
That's very encouraging.

178
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:52,760
He also said that he would bring on
whoever it is in his team that's

179
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:57,761
responsible for these things so we could
hear from the actual person who decides

180
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:02,240
who's getting banned and why they're
getting banned and what is.

181
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,520
What's the decision making behind all of
these things.

182
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:09,521
So we can go over all of them.
I didn't think the podcast would create

183
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:15,770
such a controversy,
but that's probably poor prior planning

184
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:18,680
on my part because my thought about it
was,

185
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:21,460
hey,
I want a fucking crazy to be running

186
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,280
twitter.

187
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,700
Like it's crazy that this thing exists.
The president uses it as a platform.

188
00:08:25,701 --> 00:08:29,510
I want to talk about the dude who
created this and what does this like to

189
00:08:29,511 --> 00:08:32,750
have this thing evolve to become what
it's become because it didn't start out

190
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:36,070
that way.
It started out like fun shit like at

191
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,570
Brian red bands going to the movies,
you know what I mean?

192
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,260
Like that's what people used it for.
And then along the way became this

193
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,010
global method of distributing
information where people use it in war

194
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:46,850
zones,
man,

195
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,810
they use it to,
to tell people where attacks are the

196
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:51,390
user for all kinds of crazy shit.
It's like a,

197
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,740
it's a really powerful but strange
medium.

198
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:00,350
I didn't think about getting into the
weeds with all the very specific people

199
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:02,460
that got banned.
I just wanted to find out why they

200
00:09:02,461 --> 00:09:04,320
banned people.
That was my take on it.

201
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:09,150
I know there's a lot of conservative
voices that have never been banned.

202
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,190
I don't think Steven crowder has been
banned.

203
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,650
I don't think Cernovich has been banned
as he'd been banned.

204
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,070
There's a bunch that have not been
banned.

205
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,190
Right.
So it's not like they banned all right

206
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:21,330
wing voices.
So what is it?

207
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,580
I don't know what it is.
I think it's what he said.

208
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:28,080
People reporting the tweet and then
somebody looking at it going,

209
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:31,980
well this does violate our policy and
maybe you know,

210
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:35,970
all these people that that got banned
violated the policy somehow.

211
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,700
You know,
it's probably as simple and clean as

212
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:39,290
that.
You know,

213
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,680
it's,
it's not that simple,

214
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:43,470
right?
Because they make their own policies and

215
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:47,010
it's also not that simple.
If people are allowed to say similar

216
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:52,011
things that are very racist in vast
generalizations about white people,

217
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:58,370
which seems to have been the case and at
least a few instances where people

218
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,030
reported that people said fucked up
things about white people,

219
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:04,260
but there was no repercussions.

220
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,600
And you know,
that's where the argument becomes.

221
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,610
These people are more oppressed and so
the white people were thought of as the

222
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:18,240
oppressor,
so you have this white privilege thing

223
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:23,140
that people love to use now as a reason
to to decide to like silence someone

224
00:10:23,141 --> 00:10:24,690
like check your white privilege.
That's a.

225
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,040
that's an interesting thing that's
happening,

226
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,580
so if,
if there's this genuine movement where

227
00:10:29,581 --> 00:10:33,540
people think that it's okay to say
things about one race,

228
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:39,090
whether you like it or not,
that's racism and if you're allowing

229
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:42,690
that from any one side and not allowing
it from another side,

230
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:44,310
it seems hypocritical.
Look,

231
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,580
it's very distasteful.
The idea of racism against black people

232
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:50,730
in this country is very distasteful to
everybody.

233
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,550
Almost everybody who's not a racist,
right?

234
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,080
Because of the history of this country,
because of slavery,

235
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,660
because of all these things.
It's a different connotation,

236
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:03,290
but if you just allow people to say
terrible things about any race,

237
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,250
it's racism.

238
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:10,370
You are allowing a,
like a predetermined attitude about a

239
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,590
race.
Some people have done this,

240
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,830
they have made generalizations,
generalizations,

241
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:22,110
a racist statements about white people.
The really weird thing that people are

242
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:27,690
thrown around these days is that you
can't be racist against white people

243
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:31,830
because racism is about power and
influence.

244
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,790
It's about using your.
You're in that black people are not

245
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,160
powerful to white people or power from
the white people were the ones who are

246
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:40,590
oppressed,
so it's impossible to be racist against

247
00:11:40,591 --> 00:11:43,320
them.
That sounds like horse shit to me.

248
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,480
I'm not buying that.
That doesn't make any sense.

249
00:11:45,481 --> 00:11:48,510
It's not beneficial to anybody to
generalize.

250
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:49,740
This is what we got to get it in our
head.

251
00:11:49,741 --> 00:11:52,680
It doesn't matter if you're black or
you're white or if you're whatever the

252
00:11:52,681 --> 00:11:55,870
fuck you.
It is not beneficial to generalize,

253
00:11:55,871 --> 00:12:00,871
to take a person out of the group that
we think of as just human individuals

254
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,230
that you have to be an individual.

255
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,900
I mean,
I acknowledged the fact that people look

256
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:10,290
different.
They have different heritages as the

257
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,313
heritage.
Iss,

258
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,510
they have different,
different ancestry,

259
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,240
the different occupations.
There's different parts of the world.

260
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:18,460
There's all these differences,
but at the end of the day,

261
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:23,550
the only way we're all going to get true
equality and true kinship and comradery

262
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:28,510
as human beings is that if we recognize
we're just all a human being,

263
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,690
that's it.
There are very big differences in the

264
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:34,660
way we look and the things we like.
That's cool,

265
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,590
but as soon as you.
You can say shitty things about white

266
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:43,591
people or white men,
that leaves everybody who doesn't fit

267
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:48,751
that description guilty in this weird
way or presumed guilty because of a

268
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:51,460
racist statement.
That's all it is.

269
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,870
It's not good for anybody.
I get it that it's different than racism

270
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,900
against black people in America,
a country that was built essentially in

271
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:02,440
a lot of ways by slavery.

272
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,420
There's a war for slavery in this
country and that it is a crazy reality

273
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,120
that it's not your responsibility.
It's not mine.

274
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:11,170
I didn't do it.
You didn't do it,

275
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,390
but it's real.
Therefore,

276
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,620
as a person who's aware of his history,
the history of this country,

277
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,560
racism against white people seems
different,

278
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:24,860
but it still sucks to be racist against
a racist against black people.

279
00:13:24,861 --> 00:13:25,840
Rather,
it seems different,

280
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:28,030
but it still sucks to be racist against
white people.

281
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,120
Sucks to be racist against Puerto
Ricans.

282
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,990
It's not good.
It's not good for anybody.

283
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,900
It's that's what we have to understand
about this social media thing.

284
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,780
What actually did happen and what is
happening,

285
00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:43,540
why is it happening,
and if it's just some social justice

286
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,930
warrior ethic that you're not debating,
it doesn't seem fair.

287
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,870
It seems like there should be a
conversation about this and I bet

288
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:53,230
they're super reasonable,
really intelligent people and it's

289
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:57,760
possible they can come to a good place
that we can all agree to.

290
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,300
That is possible.
I'm not a cynical person.

291
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,840
I'm sorry.
I know a lot of folks who just want

292
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:06,610
those that just want the guests what
they already have it.

293
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:11,410
They have more money than they could
ever spend and my dealings with Jack as

294
00:14:11,411 --> 00:14:14,080
a person,
he seems like a very nice guy and a very

295
00:14:14,081 --> 00:14:19,081
smart guy and and a very empathetic guy.
I just think he's in a crazy

296
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:24,310
unmanageable situation to be running
something like twitter.

297
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,970
Yeah,
and there's probably people that did

298
00:14:27,971 --> 00:14:31,990
something that they should have done in
terms of silencing people moving things

299
00:14:31,991 --> 00:14:33,820
around.
It's probably happened.

300
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:37,330
It's a weird thing when people have
influence over people and there have

301
00:14:37,331 --> 00:14:40,810
been videos had been proven.
We're executives from a bunch of

302
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:45,310
different social media corporations have
talked about how to silence certain

303
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:48,040
voices,
how to push down certain voices.

304
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,520
Um,
this is something that needs to be

305
00:14:52,521 --> 00:14:52,910
discussed.

306
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:57,350
Like is this a policy as a whole?
Is it,

307
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,720
you know,
is it because you think you're pushing

308
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:04,490
the right message as soon as someone
thinks they're pushing the right message

309
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,770
but they don't have,
there's no debate about that,

310
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,960
right?
They just decide our way's the right way

311
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,310
and they're pushing this and there's a
radical opposition to that message from

312
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:16,130
half the country like that,
but usually like,

313
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:16,401
no,
no,

314
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:18,350
no,
but this is the one that's in control.

315
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,960
That narrative.
This is the one that's in control of

316
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:24,950
social media.
It's this far left leaning ideology and

317
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:29,060
the other part gets pushed aside.
That's a very bad situation for all of

318
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:33,860
us because there has to be conversation,
there has to be debate because if

319
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:35,690
there's not,
it's just shores up the differences

320
00:15:35,691 --> 00:15:38,300
between two people and they fucking hate
each other even more.

321
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,020
I did not take that into account and I
fucked up.

322
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,840
That's my mistake.
That is my mistake when I made that

323
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:46,910
podcast,
but I didn't take it easy on them

324
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:49,340
because I didn't want to discuss those
issues.

325
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,520
I just didn't think enough of it in
advance.

326
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,190
I'm not as involved in it as other
people are.

327
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,280
I'm aware that there censorship and
social media.

328
00:15:58,281 --> 00:16:03,281
I'm aware my.
My ideas going into that conversation

329
00:16:04,191 --> 00:16:09,020
were more about how insane this method
is for distributing information for the

330
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:12,560
people that have been banned and for the
people that were fans of the people that

331
00:16:12,561 --> 00:16:14,510
are banned.
I can understand whether it be upset at

332
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:18,200
me.
It has nothing to do with any

333
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,520
preconceived notions that I had is just
how the conversation took place,

334
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,250
so all it is,
and if you felt let down by that,

335
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,350
you didn't feel like it was an extensive
enough.

336
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:31,850
I'm more than willing to do it and go
further into it and we're going to and

337
00:16:31,851 --> 00:16:35,630
Jack offered it and he's going to bring
someone else who's gonna explain things

338
00:16:35,631 --> 00:16:36,464
to us.

339
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,780
I think this will be very beneficial for
everybody.

340
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,350
I also think that there should be a road
to redemption.

341
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:48,380
I think if you've got something that's
important as twitter or facebook or

342
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:51,800
instagram,
if you're not stealing someone stuff

343
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:52,490
like,
you know,

344
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:57,230
using copyrighted music or something on
an instagram page where you get banned

345
00:16:57,231 --> 00:16:59,000
over and over again for doing it,
but you keep doing it.

346
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,800
If it's not something like that,
if it's,

347
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:01,700
if it's,
uh,

348
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,230
an ideological difference.
If you maybe you crossed a line that

349
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:07,770
they,
they decided was align,

350
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,890
you should be able to work your way
back.

351
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:13,520
You the should.
There should be a way where you can sign

352
00:17:13,521 --> 00:17:14,330
up again,
meaning,

353
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:18,590
like get a new email address.
I don't mean that I be the same person.

354
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,150
You should.
You should be able to be the same

355
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:22,250
person.
There should be a way where there should

356
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:23,030
be different levels.

357
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,220
Definitely everybody.
People fuck up,

358
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:26,480
man.
They fuck up.

359
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:27,980
And they make mistakes,
right?

360
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,270
And people also grow.
I mean there's this guy that was on Sam

361
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:36,140
Harris' podcast.
I'm Christian ecoline I think is his

362
00:17:36,141 --> 00:17:38,390
name.
He was a fucking white supremacist,

363
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:42,920
a full on white supremacist and now he
is the exact opposite.

364
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:47,921
He's like this very progressive guy who
gives speeches on the dangers of racism

365
00:17:48,921 --> 00:17:52,980
and that and the idle ideology,
how it caught up with him now if he got

366
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:57,570
banned when he was a young man and
making terrible decisions and then

367
00:17:57,571 --> 00:18:01,290
became a better person.
Shouldn't we give it a guy like that?

368
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,940
A chance to get back in a platform?
Right?

369
00:18:03,941 --> 00:18:06,300
And without making a whole new screen
name,

370
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,460
like maybe it would be.
And I don't think there's anything wrong

371
00:18:11,461 --> 00:18:14,490
with the anonymous model.
There's some things that are really good

372
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:15,324
about it,
right?

373
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,100
Like people like Jack even talked about
this,

374
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:22,370
that people can report news stuff and
not worry about fear of retribution that

375
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:25,860
they can.
They can whistle blow and not worry

376
00:18:25,861 --> 00:18:28,450
about fear of retribution if someone's
life is on the line,

377
00:18:28,451 --> 00:18:31,200
but they're trying to provide a service
to the general public or they're trying

378
00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:35,670
to give people information that maybe
might even save lives but could put them

379
00:18:35,671 --> 00:18:38,370
at risk,
especially in like third world countries

380
00:18:38,371 --> 00:18:42,420
or war torn countries.
That can be a huge problem if you have

381
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,430
to post,
you know Brian Red Band,

382
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,710
this is the only way you can get this
information out.

383
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:51,510
You have to use your whole name,
but it probably be better off for

384
00:18:51,511 --> 00:18:56,511
everybody if people had a way of
communicating with each other like it's

385
00:18:59,551 --> 00:19:04,551
just person to person and I think the
real problem is when people try to

386
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,450
engineer these conversations,
and this is another conversation about

387
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:10,284
youtube.

388
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,140
People have said that we're deleting
comments on Youtube.

389
00:19:13,141 --> 00:19:16,680
We're not deleting anything.
We haven't deleted any comments.

390
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:19,050
I don't know how it works.
I don't read them.

391
00:19:19,051 --> 00:19:22,050
I'm sure people say mean things.
Have a good time.

392
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,880
The thumbs up,
thumbs down thing.

393
00:19:23,881 --> 00:19:24,670
Look,
we we,

394
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,210
we don't have to have that on there.
You don't have to have comments on their

395
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:30,750
youtube gives you the option to have
comments on and to have the thumbs up,

396
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:32,130
thumbs down.
I'm not taking those off.

397
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,370
He could have a good time with it,
but we're not fucking with that.

398
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:39,300
There's something that they're doing
that's not.

399
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,660
It's not.
I post at 3:41 and Jamie posts it 3:42

400
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:48,960
and this is the line of the comments.
It's not like that.

401
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,120
They've got their own way of doing it.
The question is why does youtube do it?

402
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,720
What's their what?
What are they trying to do is are they

403
00:19:57,721 --> 00:19:59,520
trying to block out spam?

404
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,940
Are they trying to block out hate speech
or are they trying to engineer

405
00:20:02,941 --> 00:20:04,280
conversation?
Talking about comment,

406
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:07,740
order comments on note,
comments disappear.

407
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,410
They go away.
A lot of times it's automatic.

408
00:20:10,411 --> 00:20:14,390
If somebody flags a comment that just
take the comment away until it's like

409
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,510
looked over upon only one person.
Yeah,

410
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,620
on.
I think on youtube that that happens

411
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,630
quite often.
Probably be as little as one or two

412
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,464
people.
Yeah,

413
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,760
so that is probably what's happening to
all you folks that think your comments

414
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:28,410
are getting deleted.
No one's deleting shit.

415
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,243
Look,
I'm.

416
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,460
I'm not attached to what I do in the
sense that I'm unwilling to look at what

417
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:37,950
I do wrong.
I tried to look at everything that I do

418
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:41,730
wrong in concluding this,
so if you were upset of this podcast

419
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:45,390
because you thought somehow another I
sold out because I didn't ask him

420
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:46,224
anymore questions.

421
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,220
I just asked the questions I wanted to
ask.

422
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,400
I understand you have more costs,
more questions,

423
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:53,620
and I do too.
I have more questions too,

424
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:59,010
especially upon seeing people's reaction
to it and upon making myself pay more

425
00:21:01,151 --> 00:21:05,560
attention to all these various stories.
Matt sent us a list of them.

426
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,730
Some of them are really fucking crazy.
There's some crazy things people have

427
00:21:09,731 --> 00:21:12,910
said and not gotten in trouble for.
Whereas other people said things that

428
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:14,830
really weren't that bad and got in
trouble for it.

429
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,560
Why is that?
That's a good question to ask,

430
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,570
so we'll.
We'll concentrate on that.

431
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:23,860
We're just going to work out a date,
so my humblest apologies to all of you.

432
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:27,160
Don't not trying to let anybody down.
I always try to do my best.

433
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,530
That's it.
And,

434
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,320
and also here's another clear one.
No one tells me what to do.

435
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,350
There's no one,
there's no secret person behind the

436
00:21:35,351 --> 00:21:35,950
scenes.

437
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,450
If I fuck up,
it's because of me.

438
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,000
It's my fuck up.
I should've prepared more.

439
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,090
I should have thought about it more,
but I didn't realize like how upset

440
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:44,770
people would be.
I think he did a great.

441
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:47,380
I thought it was a great interview and I
didn't even think of that.

442
00:21:47,381 --> 00:21:50,860
I thought you kind of touched on it a
little when you were talking about Alex

443
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,100
Jones and I think that was like,
okay,

444
00:21:52,101 --> 00:21:53,350
you know,
this is what happens.

445
00:21:53,351 --> 00:21:54,850
Well,
it's a very specific group of people

446
00:21:54,851 --> 00:21:57,350
that are upset.
Right wing guys is,

447
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,970
there's a lot of American flags,
a lot of pepe the frog.

448
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,870
It's all right.
People,

449
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,220
which look,
man easily could've been me at many

450
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:10,510
points in my life easily.
Especially being a troll online.

451
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,370
You know,
if you're working in some fucking job

452
00:22:12,371 --> 00:22:14,980
and you make him pepe the frog memes and
you're fucking with people,

453
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,600
I get it.

454
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:19,750
I get it.
It's one of the things I like about the

455
00:22:19,751 --> 00:22:20,950
internet,
like I don't,

456
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,980
I don't want to be comfortable.
I'm like,

457
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,210
I don't,
I don't want to be comfortable all the

458
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:27,130
time I want.
I want a little bit of chaos.

459
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,170
I like the fact that there's people
like,

460
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:32,170
they're like that fucking.
I was upset that that radio,

461
00:22:32,171 --> 00:22:34,000
that podcast,
they took it down where they were

462
00:22:34,001 --> 00:22:38,140
fucking with Shiela bu with those guys
from four Chan and the way they took it

463
00:22:38,141 --> 00:22:42,250
down was they contacted radio lab and
said those guys are white supremacists

464
00:22:42,251 --> 00:22:44,440
and they support white supremacy.
You know,

465
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:46,000
and then you just,
you know,

466
00:22:46,001 --> 00:22:49,780
you made these people that are awful,
terrible people that write terrible

467
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:50,740
things.
You,

468
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:52,270
you,
you gave them props.

469
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,030
But the thing about something like four
Chan is no,

470
00:22:55,031 --> 00:22:58,810
you might read some terrible things,
but you've got to realize you're also

471
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:02,140
reading terrible things from anonymous
people that are working at their jobs

472
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:05,500
most of the time and they're trying to
fuck with people's heads and the trying

473
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:06,610
to get people upset.

474
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,340
They're there.
They're having a good time fucking with

475
00:23:09,341 --> 00:23:12,460
people if you want to take them as that,
that's like them,

476
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:16,270
like giving,
giving a talk to a dear friend or them

477
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:17,770
giving you an affidavit in court.
Well,

478
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,560
you're missing the whole thing.
It's entertainment like half of the

479
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:22,150
whole reason why they're doing it is
entertainment.

480
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:27,360
They didn't go steal shiela booze flag
and go and go right into the camera and

481
00:23:27,611 --> 00:23:31,120
go fuck Shiela.
Bu By using coordinates from photographs

482
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:35,830
of the sky where they figured out where
the fucking with the constellations lie

483
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:40,120
and then drove around honking their horn
so that they could locate where it was

484
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:43,360
by using the Webcam and listening to how
close they got to it.

485
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:48,260
I mean it's fucking genius shit and it
got taken down just by this accusation

486
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:51,470
of them being racist.
But the thing about a forum like four

487
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:56,300
Chan or Reddit or anything,
you have so many fucking people.

488
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:01,340
You have 3000 and thousands and
thousands of people.

489
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:06,230
If you have 10 clients posting jokes
about black people,

490
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,400
that's all you need to ruin the
reputation of thousands of people.

491
00:24:10,401 --> 00:24:13,960
So for someone to say that everybody
that was like,

492
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,160
fuck Shiela,
Bu is some racist and the white

493
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:18,410
supremacist,
that's a cheap way out.

494
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,270
That's a cheap way out.
I bet.

495
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:23,750
More likely it's some duties board and
he's sitting in front of his fucking

496
00:24:23,751 --> 00:24:27,410
computer and he works all day and this
is where he escapes.

497
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,790
He escapes and types in writes things.
Then check some later and then it goes

498
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:36,590
back to and type thing and checks and it
keeps him sane and the stupid fucking

499
00:24:36,591 --> 00:24:39,170
cubicle.
That's a lot of the people.

500
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:43,430
So they pulled that whole amazing
podcast down because of that.

501
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,490
Look what He.
The Shiloh booth thing was ridiculous.

502
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,950
He will not divide us.
Come on,

503
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,330
stop.

504
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,700
Stop.
We get a chance at everywhere.

505
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:56,300
It's funny what they did.
They mocked something that's their way

506
00:24:56,301 --> 00:24:58,100
of mocking it.
Nobody got hurt.

507
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,470
They made it out like it was really
awful crime.

508
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:03,770
They committed on this.
This amazing person who's just trying to

509
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:05,300
change the world.
No,

510
00:25:05,301 --> 00:25:07,060
no.
They prank Ceaila Boo.

511
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:12,580
And they said,
fuck Shiela bu this is that as of the

512
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,190
above,
whatever it is.

513
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:17,240
Shiela buff special.
He's a nice guy too.

514
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,420
He probably did something silly.
It's a little silly.

515
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,750
He will not divide us.
What they.

516
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,860
What they did was funny.
It's a funny reaction.

517
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,940
I.
I liked that.

518
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:30,650
I like that this is an important part of
this thing.

519
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,040
If it wasn't for people like that,
there would be no podcast.

520
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:39,520
Now the like to dislike ratio that you
see on youtube videos is fascinating,

521
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:41,870
right?
Because it's weaponized and they're

522
00:25:41,871 --> 00:25:46,340
thinking about trying to ban that now
because so many people use it to fuck

523
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:49,490
with people.
I hate to say this about you folks,

524
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,950
but every time we have a chicken here,
they get fucking torture.

525
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,950
The like to dislike,
right?

526
00:25:53,951 --> 00:25:55,670
Like it's ruthless.
Except Rhonda.

527
00:25:55,671 --> 00:25:56,690
Patrick said

528
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,840
Rhonda Patrick,
but it's just like it's weaponized.

529
00:25:58,841 --> 00:26:00,850
It's the.
They're just going to dislike it

530
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,560
because.
Because it's fun because it's fun

531
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:05,140
because it's fun.
It's also fun to throw a rock at a

532
00:26:05,141 --> 00:26:05,974
window.

533
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:07,410
It's fun.
Yeah.

534
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:10,760
Some of them probably didn't even watch
the podcasts like thumbs down gives them

535
00:26:10,761 --> 00:26:13,340
a disliking.
It gives a little bit of power and the

536
00:26:13,341 --> 00:26:17,740
algorithm ofd ranking.
It affected something and people who

537
00:26:17,741 --> 00:26:19,340
liked it,
there's a probably a lot of them that

538
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:21,230
didn't even watch it.
There's a button you can press.

539
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,520
People are weird,
you know,

540
00:26:22,521 --> 00:26:25,190
but it's clearly it shows by the amount
of dislike.

541
00:26:25,191 --> 00:26:27,230
The people moved on it and they were
upset about it.

542
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,010
So it's basically it.
We'll see.

543
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,780
There's a lot of cool,
interesting questions that to ask him.

544
00:26:34,781 --> 00:26:37,390
Like I always thought shadow banning was
a real thing,

545
00:26:37,391 --> 00:26:40,030
but I think he came out and said that
that's not a real thing.

546
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,040
I've,
I've seen it in my,

547
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,160
in person where I'll type

548
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,120
somebody's name in and usually it's
splits to come up on the searches,

549
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:49,770
but it doesn't in our

550
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:54,090
planning is if it is a real thing,
like that's another one,

551
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:56,460
like shadow banning for what?
Like if it,

552
00:26:56,461 --> 00:27:01,461
if it's not something that is.
If you're not doing something that you

553
00:27:01,471 --> 00:27:03,030
could get kicked off the platform for
it.

554
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:04,050
Right.
You're not kicking them off,

555
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,570
you just pushing them down.
Weird place.

556
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,490
But if you're doing that,
like why are you doing that?

557
00:27:08,491 --> 00:27:09,324
Like what?

558
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,230
Because like,
but what would be the justification from

559
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:14,990
the ones that I have seen three used to
even be a website that you could type in

560
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,940
somebody's user name to see if there are
shadow bands,

561
00:27:16,941 --> 00:27:21,080
so that's kind of interesting,
but a lot of porn stars or shadow banned

562
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,720
because they don't want.
If you're looking up Christina

563
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,553
applegate,
they want Christina,

564
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,630
you know,
apple bottom or something like that.

565
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,960
You know what I mean?
So it's,

566
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,000
it's,
I,

567
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,800
I,
I still believe that's a thing,

568
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,890
but I'm pretty sure he came out and said
it wasn't a real thing.

569
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,620
Technically shadow banning Justin Bieber
from the trending topics.

570
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,780
Right.
I mean they have publicly said that

571
00:27:38,781 --> 00:27:41,780
that's not a shadow ban.
That's a strategy.

572
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,661
Well,
no,

573
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,450
they were kind of forced into it because
Justin Bieber was so.

574
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:49,770
His fans trend so hard.
They hashtag the shit out of that thing

575
00:27:49,771 --> 00:27:51,390
and they just took over the trending.

576
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:55,040
That's probably happening for other
equally popular celebrities too,

577
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:56,530
like Taylor swift's and beyond time.

578
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,480
Yeah,
yeah,

579
00:27:57,481 --> 00:27:58,500
yeah.
You're probably right.

580
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,010
You're probably right.
So whatever they're doing at youtube

581
00:28:02,011 --> 00:28:04,500
with comments and whatever they're doing
with twitter,

582
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,660
here's the real conversation,
right?

583
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:11,010
The real conversation is,
do we want that?

584
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,520
Do we want them to cure rate?
Do we want them to decide whose youtube

585
00:28:18,211 --> 00:28:22,440
videos you can subscribe to and who do
they unsubscribe people?

586
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,780
Is that real or is that a glitch?
I.

587
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,890
Yeah.
Who knows?

588
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,020
I don't think they unsubscribe.
I don't think so either,

589
00:28:28,021 --> 00:28:28,990
but people have.
Well,

590
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,780
let's listen.
If they're willing to move justin bieber

591
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:37,230
from the number one trending because
he'd number one trends too hard and they

592
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:39,720
think it's ridiculous.
Not to just acknowledge that our

593
00:28:39,721 --> 00:28:42,000
culture,
there's certain humans in our culture,

594
00:28:42,001 --> 00:28:44,610
we're spending an exorbitant amount of
time thinking about that.

595
00:28:44,611 --> 00:28:45,990
Beautiful Man,
right?

596
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:48,870
There's a lot,
but why do we want to lie and pretend

597
00:28:48,871 --> 00:28:50,760
that it's not as big.
So if they just.

598
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,840
I'm not saying they shouldn't,
but if they did that just.

599
00:28:54,841 --> 00:28:56,250
If they did that,
you go,

600
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:58,110
okay,
are we through the looking glass?

601
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,370
Now you can change the data.
Like what?

602
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:04,290
What do you lend?
When do you decide who gets pushed here?

603
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:05,400
Who gets pushed there

604
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:09,020
side?
Definitely the trending page on youtube

605
00:29:09,021 --> 00:29:12,380
is 100 percent controlled by a human.
I don't know if they've said that,

606
00:29:12,381 --> 00:29:17,210
but there are videos that should be
there that aren't based off of the data.

607
00:29:17,211 --> 00:29:21,110
You see Youtube has got some weird
things going on with it.

608
00:29:21,111 --> 00:29:23,450
Like there's a.
The video is that they go,

609
00:29:23,451 --> 00:29:26,800
you might like type thing.
They did it.

610
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:31,280
You might like to me a couple months ago
where it was just videos of a guy towing

611
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:35,510
cars in dallas like out of their parking
lot and he made these funny cute little

612
00:29:35,511 --> 00:29:39,560
videos with a little commentary using
videos from the security cameras.

613
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,380
Anyways,
I don't know why I it,

614
00:29:41,381 --> 00:29:42,630
but I started watching it and I was
like,

615
00:29:42,631 --> 00:29:43,660
you know,
this is interesting.

616
00:29:43,661 --> 00:29:48,370
So I tweeted it out like random video I
just got addicted to on Youtube.

617
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,740
Everybody was like hundreds of people
who are like,

618
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,180
I just started watching that.

619
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,940
Youtube recommended that to me.
Like how did that happen?

620
00:29:54,941 --> 00:29:57,490
You know,
this little guy with a tow truck company

621
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,840
has now pushed on everybody's laps and
now he just went over 100,000

622
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:05,190
subscribers the other day and it was
like months ago that he was just had

623
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,600
like 10 that,
that.

624
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:09,880
That's the argument some people have
made that that's how fast the Paul

625
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:12,460
brothers,
they grew and they grew so fast on

626
00:30:12,461 --> 00:30:15,310
youtube that some people thought there
was something up that game like millions

627
00:30:15,311 --> 00:30:18,010
of followers within a week or two of
being on there and then they were coming

628
00:30:18,011 --> 00:30:18,840
from another platform.

629
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,540
Well it's also coming from another
platform is giant,

630
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:26,250
but it's also all it really takes is one
person deciding that whatever the fuck

631
00:30:26,251 --> 00:30:30,420
you did was funny or weird or crazy.
Like that cashew outside girl.

632
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,120
Yeah.
Well there's that girls are managed by

633
00:30:34,121 --> 00:30:37,460
the same people that own tmz and that's
why you see it on tmz every.

634
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,820
I was going to bring up,
if you want to fire the fire festival

635
00:30:39,821 --> 00:30:40,950
documentary,
there's a,

636
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,600
an explanation of this show.
How this,

637
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:45,310
uh,
they spread of the Fuck Jerry guys,

638
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,770
the marketing team spread that with the
orange picture.

639
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:52,450
It was a coordinated event over hundreds
of different social media accounts for

640
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:53,720
her,
for the cash me outside girl.

641
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,880
For the FYRE festival.
Yeah.

642
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,560
Firefox to catch everybody's.
Because there are a team of people.

643
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:02,530
There are agencies that have all this
influence or accounts.

644
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,680
They paid them.
They don't have to accept the money or

645
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:09,550
accept the offer except the campaign,
but oftentimes they do.

646
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,890
So it's like a talent agency.
One hundred percent.

647
00:31:11,891 --> 00:31:12,280
Yeah.
Yeah.

648
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,870
Interesting.
I don't need to share a new person,

649
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:14,704
you know,
launch the next,

650
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,090
the next voice,
and it's like,

651
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:17,110
oh,
here's a new song.

652
00:31:17,111 --> 00:31:19,070
There's a new movie.
It's just a new way to suppress stuff.

653
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,180
It's pretty cool watching how many
people are unsubscribing to fuck Jerry

654
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:25,240
and the fat Jew though.
That's.

655
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,670
But are they?
I looked at the other day was the day of

656
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,940
like $14 million.
500,000 dollars a week.

657
00:31:31,941 --> 00:31:33,840
Weekend real estate,
a significant amount of time.

658
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:36,960
I was 14 point seven then it was 14
point one.

659
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:40,390
Haven't looked today,
but that's coming from I think of video.

660
00:31:40,391 --> 00:31:43,170
Someone to shared this week.
I think vic Berger made a video that got

661
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,110
spread around and they took his video.
Right.

662
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,510
I,
maybe that's what he said.

663
00:31:48,511 --> 00:31:52,200
I think I saw it on burgers page.
Here's a few comics I've posted videos

664
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,034
like,
hey,

665
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,900
you know,
fat Jews stole this,

666
00:31:54,901 --> 00:31:57,270
you know,
and I tried to reach out and they never

667
00:31:57,271 --> 00:31:58,920
got back to me.
He got 10 million.

668
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,230
What do you think about this idea
though?

669
00:32:01,231 --> 00:32:03,820
Like that's kind of piracy,
you know?

670
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,910
And so instagram's allowing twitter's
allowing piracy.

671
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:13,620
Well I think they're allowing these
people to post videos because you don't

672
00:32:13,621 --> 00:32:15,030
really know where it came from.

673
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,950
There's no proof.
Right?

674
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,290
Like if you find a meme,
like how many times he posted a Meme,

675
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,570
I pee,
I repost whoever sent it to me.

676
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,750
If someone sends it to me,
but sometimes I'll just find it in a

677
00:32:24,751 --> 00:32:28,290
google search and you've got to figure
out who made that meme and if I find

678
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:30,720
their instagram account that I'll try to
find it and repost it,

679
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,810
but some people don't and I haven't in
the past.

680
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:37,980
Like I did that one with a baked Alaska
got mad at me because there was one with

681
00:32:37,981 --> 00:32:39,680
Alex Jones sitting in hot tub

682
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,410
and it's uh,
it's like when your friends are trying

683
00:32:42,411 --> 00:32:44,660
to chill and,
but you have to keep dropping truth

684
00:32:44,661 --> 00:32:46,070
bombs.
It was hilarious.

685
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,590
I didn't know it was his right.
I just posted it because someone said to

686
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,480
me,
someone sent it to me in a text message,

687
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:54,980
I think.
But those things have a creator.

688
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:57,710
Right.
And I know Pete,

689
00:32:57,711 --> 00:33:00,080
like Eddie Bravo makes his own.
He makes them sometimes,

690
00:33:00,081 --> 00:33:03,860
but he'll send some to me or post some
online that he finds that are funny too.

691
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,410
And everybody tries to credit the person
who did it right.

692
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:11,810
But now what they do is they,
they take it and they credit the person,

693
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,210
but they didn't

694
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,380
for so long.
They only attempt.

695
00:33:16,381 --> 00:33:18,030
They're accrediting fake accounts.
So they'll make,

696
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,840
they have.
So they're not getting busted in the

697
00:33:21,841 --> 00:33:22,621
way.
You're just explaining.

698
00:33:22,621 --> 00:33:23,460
I've seen that too.
Well,

699
00:33:23,461 --> 00:33:25,980
what is that about though?
Because that seems like deception.

700
00:33:25,981 --> 00:33:29,850
It's just the way around the back door
and that that qualification of it needs

701
00:33:29,851 --> 00:33:31,380
to be on an account.
We need to point to somebody,

702
00:33:31,381 --> 00:33:32,970
okay,
well we'll point to this account,

703
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,260
but it's not even a real account and if
they find like they'll post stuff and

704
00:33:37,261 --> 00:33:41,880
then later add the person because the
person contacts them and they're almost

705
00:33:41,881 --> 00:33:46,881
like that's admitting to piracy like we
did hire because if they just reposting

706
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,140
it,
a lot of folks including me do that.

707
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,520
Yeah,
but they're making the person making

708
00:33:50,521 --> 00:33:51,600
money or not.

709
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,820
Yeah,
that's important.

710
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,430
I don't make any money off my instagram.
Right.

711
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:00,330
They're making millions.
I've been offered to post stuff up and

712
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:04,140
I'm not saying that I wouldn't.
If something was fucking killer and they

713
00:34:04,141 --> 00:34:06,180
wanted to give me money,
I'm greedy.

714
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:09,330
I'll take some money,
but it wouldn't lie about it.

715
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,530
I haven't yet.
I've never accepted any money yet.

716
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:14,900
Yeah,
because it's also,

717
00:34:14,901 --> 00:34:19,901
I think in instagram's a law that you
have to put that it's an ad if you're

718
00:34:21,171 --> 00:34:25,370
making money off of it and so that's
another thing that both fuck Jerry and

719
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:27,660
fat Jew or not doing.
They're not putting the cad is.

720
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:31,310
I just wanted like to devil's advocate
this though is is there a place for them

721
00:34:31,311 --> 00:34:34,960
for those accounts?
Like is there a place to be the re

722
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,910
tweeter have the means to be that guy to
be that account,

723
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:40,560
you know,
like isn't that valuable source?

724
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,200
It is a curator position.

725
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,200
Yeah.
It's kind of valuable.

726
00:34:43,201 --> 00:34:46,530
But the question is like if it,
if it is valuable and it becomes

727
00:34:46,531 --> 00:34:49,400
something almost like redistributing
your standup.

728
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:52,610
If you're doing a set,
like if standup sets where you know

729
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,830
something that you just,
you could get everywhere and you could

730
00:34:55,831 --> 00:34:59,430
just repost it on your page but then
your page becomes super popular because

731
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:02,850
you are all these people stand up sets.
You know like spotify,

732
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:05,430
spotify gets ads right?
But they don't really.

733
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,370
They pay the artists a little bit,
but mostly they make all the money.

734
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,760
Yeah.
And you know like if it's,

735
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:13,150
you use like say sorry later,
you just do it and say I'm sorry,

736
00:35:13,151 --> 00:35:16,090
we'll figure it out after the fact.
Or you figure it out.

737
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:21,150
Business oriented things that have art
in them as opposed to art

738
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,160
oriented,
things that start making money.

739
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:27,460
There are two very different things,
so this is not an art thing.

740
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,430
This is a.
They find other people's art and they

741
00:35:30,431 --> 00:35:32,080
sell it.
They're pushing it,

742
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,260
they create these accounts.
The accounts get giant.

743
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,540
People pass it around because they're
just finding funny things and then they

744
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:42,090
start profiting,
but all the people that created all the

745
00:35:42,091 --> 00:35:46,080
intellectual property gets zero money.
Which is weird.

746
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:49,650
I don't remember,
but I only learned more about this when

747
00:35:49,651 --> 00:35:52,680
exit through the gift shop came out.
Isn't that what Andy Warhol sort of did?

748
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,770
I don't know and I don't care.
I mean maybe he did.

749
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,710
Maybe he did,
but the thing about it is that this is

750
00:35:58,711 --> 00:36:01,980
happening right now on the Internet.
It's a totally different animal.

751
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,470
I mean,
Andy Warhol wasn't running around taking

752
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:08,360
exact photo duplicates and putting them
on his website for sale like these.

753
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:12,630
This is when someone's doing on an
instagram page is like you could within

754
00:36:12,631 --> 00:36:16,110
seconds take a piece and put it
somewhere else.

755
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,840
It's seconds.
Brian posts something.

756
00:36:18,841 --> 00:36:20,070
I think it's funny.
Ha,

757
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:24,540
I go to copy,
I go to the fucking repost at a APP,

758
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,900
I put it in there,
I'll repost it.

759
00:36:26,901 --> 00:36:30,330
It's seconds later.
You could do that all day and if you

760
00:36:30,331 --> 00:36:32,520
hire kids,
I don't know if he has people working

761
00:36:32,521 --> 00:36:33,960
for them,
but if these guys do,

762
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:38,040
they hire people for fucking 20 bucks an
hour or whatever and these people just

763
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,700
do it all day long.
They just find funny shit all day long.

764
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:44,850
They look for certain hashtags.
Meme factories or what they're calling.

765
00:36:44,851 --> 00:36:45,600
Yeah,
yeah,

766
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,400
yeah.
And there's some people like,

767
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,370
you know,
that have made some funny ones all their

768
00:36:50,371 --> 00:36:51,210
own,
you know,

769
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:52,830
a lot of people that are just doing that
all.

770
00:36:52,831 --> 00:36:56,190
I know Dalea has done a bunch of them
and then there's also one that they do

771
00:36:56,191 --> 00:37:00,840
where they steal people's act and make a
meme out of it and then posted it on

772
00:37:00,841 --> 00:37:01,674
their page.

773
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,650
That's where it gets even more slippery
because you're talking about like

774
00:37:04,651 --> 00:37:08,140
standups acts that you're,
you're making money off it.

775
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,050
How much are they making off each post?
I mean,

776
00:37:10,051 --> 00:37:11,790
I don't know,
but these are multimillion dollar

777
00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:15,300
business and the punchline,
so now you have this 10 minute joke that

778
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,760
everyone has the punchline because they
saw it on facebook.

779
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:21,030
That's like,
spoiler alert one for sure if you're

780
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:24,540
still doing that material because it
wasn't on Netflix or a comedy central

781
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:25,830
special or something.
For sure.

782
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,730
That sucks.
I guess it's always happened though,

783
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:32,330
hasn't it?
TV shows have been accused of stealing a

784
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,200
stolen.
It's happened on.

785
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,380
Do they did it to Kevin James?
I saw it happen.

786
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:42,560
Kevin James was at the uh,
he had a development deal for NBC back

787
00:37:42,981 --> 00:37:45,330
in the,
a back when we were young pups.

788
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,060
Both of us were like 27 or some shit.

789
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,760
Maybe he's a little older than that.
Maybe it was actually,

790
00:37:50,761 --> 00:37:53,070
that was like during the news radio
days,

791
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:57,420
so we're probably like in our thirties
and he had this development deal,

792
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,980
nice development deal.
They're paying them a lot,

793
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,750
a lot of gas,
a lot of paper and they were setting up

794
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:07,590
a sitcom around him.
So they had him do a set at a theater in

795
00:38:07,591 --> 00:38:11,220
Hollywood and I was there.
And he does this set and has all these

796
00:38:11,221 --> 00:38:15,750
writers from various sitcoms and the
very next season,

797
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:21,050
one of his best jokes is on an episode
of a television show that's very

798
00:38:21,961 --> 00:38:24,300
popular.
Very popular.

799
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,280
Yeah,
yeah,

800
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,230
yeah.
And uh,

801
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,930
they fucking stole his bitmap.
I guess that's where I was going because

802
00:38:30,931 --> 00:38:33,690
that was in the nineties.
So like we're now 25,

803
00:38:33,691 --> 00:38:34,800
20,
25 years later.

804
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:36,100
The popular medium

805
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,490
is instagram and social media different
is that.

806
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,550
Well,
it's different because there's

807
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:44,660
accountability now because now people
know that if you wrote a meme and you

808
00:38:44,661 --> 00:38:49,220
put it up on your site and then fuck
jerry comes along and steals your shit

809
00:38:49,221 --> 00:38:51,560
and doesn't credit you for it,
just puts it up there.

810
00:38:51,561 --> 00:38:55,400
You know what they did,
unless someone sent it to them and

811
00:38:55,401 --> 00:38:57,800
didn't attribute it to you,
which is possible,

812
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:02,660
but it seems much more likely that what
they're doing,

813
00:39:02,661 --> 00:39:04,460
they were doing on purpose for the
longest time.

814
00:39:04,461 --> 00:39:06,620
And they just did.
They thought that's what you could do on

815
00:39:06,621 --> 00:39:08,000
the Internet.
It's a wild west.

816
00:39:08,001 --> 00:39:11,870
You could just take memes and you can
become famous and looked at fat Jewish

817
00:39:11,871 --> 00:39:12,530
guy,
did it.

818
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:16,460
I mean that guy became famous.
What whether you agree with his methods

819
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,410
or not.
It worked.

820
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,920
He got his crazy hair.
He shows you,

821
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:23,030
you know,
like he's just crazy looking guy and he

822
00:39:23,031 --> 00:39:27,680
has all these funny memes that somebody
else wrote and they're all up on his

823
00:39:27,681 --> 00:39:30,950
instagram page and it worked and people
don't like him.

824
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,660
Now there's a lot of people that don't
like him.

825
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:34,550
People will get real shitty with them in
person.

826
00:39:34,551 --> 00:39:36,710
They don't want them to do an appearance
because they know what he did.

827
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,710
So there's a certain number of people
that go,

828
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:40,820
hey man,
you're a thief.

829
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:43,790
Like this is not cool.
Like what you did is not cool.

830
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,790
But then there's certain people that
don't care and then there's certain

831
00:39:46,791 --> 00:39:47,690
people that think,
well,

832
00:39:47,691 --> 00:39:50,810
what he did was just what anybody did
back then.

833
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,870
It was the wild west.
No one thought about it and once he

834
00:39:53,871 --> 00:39:56,210
established that business model and it
was effective,

835
00:39:56,390 --> 00:40:00,260
it was probably very hard for him to
slow it down or to attribute things to

836
00:40:00,261 --> 00:40:02,750
people or to admit that he didn't do it
for all.

837
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,980
That amount of time

838
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:09,900
just bugs me that companies pay these
guys knowing that they do this or like

839
00:40:09,901 --> 00:40:11,070
as a Jew,
he's like,

840
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,800
see,
he's signed with caa who's signed with a

841
00:40:13,801 --> 00:40:15,510
bunch of comedians they probably took,
you know,

842
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:17,970
they're taken from the same basket.
So it's like,

843
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,320
it is weird,
right?

844
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:22,770
Yeah.
Now if he was going on stage and doing

845
00:40:22,771 --> 00:40:24,570
their acts,
she's been doing appearances.

846
00:40:24,571 --> 00:40:25,680
Right.
He's got a book.

847
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,740
He's been on TV shows.
Well,

848
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,490
I don't know.
I don't know what he's doing.

849
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,830
He's doing by maybe showing up,
but he's.

850
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,050
Look,
he's obviously used it for profit.

851
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,540
He's figured out a way to profit.
It's weird.

852
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:39,120
He must be weirded out by this fuck
jerry thing too,

853
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,490
because you might be.
Must be sitting there going,

854
00:40:41,491 --> 00:40:42,420
okay,
all right,

855
00:40:42,421 --> 00:40:45,030
here was going to leave me alone.

856
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,953
It's,
um,

857
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:51,820
you know,
comedy central was advertising on the

858
00:40:51,821 --> 00:40:55,060
fuck Jerry page,
which is like Jesus folks.

859
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,190
I didn't know that.
Yeah.

860
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,350
It was like Jesus folks,
can I just sit you guys down?

861
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,140
Go over a little history.

862
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:02,993
Sure.
Comedy.

863
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,840
Well,
I mean it might've been car.

864
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:06,690
They didn't learn that either,
you know.

865
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,440
Well that was while it was happening,
you know,

866
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,350
they,
they did learn eventually they let it go

867
00:41:11,351 --> 00:41:13,330
eventually.
But that was also because the ratings

868
00:41:13,331 --> 00:41:14,280
have dropped through the floor or

869
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:18,840
you know,
comedies on fucking easy to make up,

870
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:22,620
you know,
especially like meme kind of comedy

871
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,230
that's done by folks that are working in
offices,

872
00:41:25,231 --> 00:41:28,080
meme kind of comedy,
some of the funniest fucking comedy on

873
00:41:28,081 --> 00:41:30,240
earth.
And it's done by regular people.

874
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:34,220
It's not like a,
it sound like most

875
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:39,250
memes are written by high level
satirists that worked for the New

876
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:39,711
Yorker.
No,

877
00:41:39,711 --> 00:41:42,740
they're fucking regular folks who think
something's funny.

878
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,340
You know,
I think what's going to happen is that

879
00:41:45,341 --> 00:41:49,010
as technology improves,
the like being able to scan a photo and

880
00:41:49,011 --> 00:41:51,260
go,
well we could tell the first time this

881
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:53,660
was ever put on the Internet with from
this little girl,

882
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:57,860
she took a photo of it has all the data
in the picture and that's now used on

883
00:41:57,861 --> 00:42:00,180
this mean that's making this much money
in this game.

884
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,230
Then it's gonna be kind of broken down
like a,

885
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,620
you know,
any kind of artists.

886
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,120
Yes,
yes.

887
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:09,290
I mean the idea for the buyer and the
argument for the block chain getting

888
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:11,150
involved in here because we could tie
that.

889
00:42:11,151 --> 00:42:13,040
You can,
I guess it can be in the data and the

890
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:13,940
bins like.
No.

891
00:42:13,941 --> 00:42:14,630
Let me ask you this.

892
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:18,290
What if someone uses a picture of your
band,

893
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:20,960
so you have a band,
they use a picture of your band and then

894
00:42:20,961 --> 00:42:25,610
they have a funny meme under the picture
of your band who owns that?

895
00:42:25,611 --> 00:42:27,890
Then that's what like,
I think beyonce tried to get that

896
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:30,530
picture taken off the Internet from her
from the super bowl a couple years ago

897
00:42:30,531 --> 00:42:33,650
because it was like a bad picture.
She didn't like how she looked in it.

898
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:34,830
That's hilarious.
Yeah.

899
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:37,010
That's how the fuck is that lady to take
a bad picture.

900
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,930
I just,
she doesn't talk to her.

901
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,420
Go listen.
It's good.

902
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:43,760
It's not your best,
but you look fucking great.

903
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,920
Like if that shit was on tinder,
you know,

904
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:48,800
you wouldn't be on like did it?
Who?

905
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:52,850
If someone was paying for that meme
should be onstage gets some of the money

906
00:42:52,851 --> 00:42:55,140
or that's.
That's the question you would have with

907
00:42:55,141 --> 00:42:56,300
like a corporation.

908
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:58,220
Right?
Which should someone be able to grab

909
00:42:58,221 --> 00:42:59,930
photos that are out in the public
domain,

910
00:42:59,931 --> 00:43:02,030
make something with it and then
profiting.

911
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:03,950
That's the,
that's.

912
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:06,870
There's been a lot of bands.
I'm sure that that's why I said bands

913
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,980
because they're like really good at
protecting copyright and their logo and

914
00:43:09,981 --> 00:43:12,200
shit.
If you had like the kiss band logo,

915
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,060
you don't think gene Simmons would come
at you.

916
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,730
He's coming at you with some lawyers,
100 percent,

917
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:18,410
right.
That's just what he's going to do,

918
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:21,800
but it's who owns those photos?
If it's like Gene Simmons,

919
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:25,700
like spitting fire out and I think if
you took the photo and the cameras were

920
00:43:25,701 --> 00:43:30,701
allowed inside the event you took it,
but it's not for what the cases though.

921
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,920
Most of the photographs or people that
are putting out there,

922
00:43:33,921 --> 00:43:35,870
just putting them up online and someone
takes it.

923
00:43:35,871 --> 00:43:39,440
It's like say if you gene simmons
spitting fire and then it has a joke

924
00:43:39,441 --> 00:43:43,490
about eating hookers,
pussy or something like whatever it is.

925
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:48,550
Like make something funny there.
If that's online and that becomes this

926
00:43:48,561 --> 00:43:53,080
giant meme that gets all these likes and
that somehow or another someone,

927
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,060
how the fuck do you profit from you?
From instagram?

928
00:43:56,061 --> 00:43:59,540
You don't profit from individual posts,
but those individual posts will boost

929
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:01,470
your signal.
Yeah.

930
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:03,800
Some posts are profit.
Instagram,

931
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:08,030
you have to say add on it to say
sponsored post,

932
00:44:08,031 --> 00:44:08,864
right?
Yeah.

933
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,160
What legally exposed to,
but I'd probably say 90 percent of them

934
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,053
aren't.
Right.

935
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,150
A lot of people don't write,
especially if it's like instagram is you

936
00:44:17,151 --> 00:44:20,620
can get away with it.
Instagram models talking about t I e s

937
00:44:20,621 --> 00:44:21,454
t,
eh?

938
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:24,560
Yeah.
It's a whole instagram model is a

939
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:27,910
fucking hilarious position.
It really is.

940
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:29,590
Powerful position.
Yeah.

941
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,450
It's hilarious though.
It's,

942
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,380
it's amazing how many of them there are
and they make money.

943
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,850
No,
it's smart.

944
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,700
It's amazing how butts are such a big
thing now.

945
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,160
Yeah.
And like when I was a kid that no one

946
00:44:41,161 --> 00:44:42,390
cared about butts.
It was big.

947
00:44:42,391 --> 00:44:43,380
But you're like,
Ooh,

948
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:44,190
listen,
wait.

949
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,420
Yeah.
We talked about this before

950
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:50,890
when I said let's start mixed a lot of
change the game and everybody's like,

951
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:52,950
oh you like big butts.
Hey,

952
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:58,400
I kinda like for whatever reason,
it wasn't even an issue back then.

953
00:44:58,561 --> 00:45:03,390
Girls would have giant fake boobs and
tiny flat butts and they were perfect.

954
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:07,260
My grandmother would have millions of
instagram model hits.

955
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:09,840
Fat bottom girls was before that
slightly,

956
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:12,870
but no one really.
It didn't make the rock world go round.

957
00:45:12,871 --> 00:45:16,080
That's a great God damn song.
I didn't see Bohemian rhapsody.

958
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:17,220
Did you?
Did you see it?

959
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,460
I heard it wasn't that good.
What the fuck are you guys talking

960
00:45:20,461 --> 00:45:22,170
about?
I heard it was amazing.

961
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:22,980
Did you?
Yeah,

962
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,960
I did.
I'm a giant queen fan though.

963
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:29,010
I love them.
That's my number one cryogenic song when

964
00:45:29,011 --> 00:45:31,750
I'm in the crowd chambers dragging
attack to do

965
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:36,660
because you got to move around when
you're in that 240 degrees below zero.

966
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:39,460
It's hard to just sit.
Still do a little dancing in there.

967
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,750
Uh,
he did a rainy Malik,

968
00:45:42,751 --> 00:45:45,750
I think is the,
the actor's name that played him Freddy

969
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,330
Mercury.
Oh,

970
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:48,300
good job.
But before it happened,

971
00:45:48,301 --> 00:45:50,550
Sacha Baron Cohen was sort of in talks
for it,

972
00:45:50,551 --> 00:45:53,490
but you wanted to take the character in
a different direction that no one was

973
00:45:53,491 --> 00:45:57,450
really comfortable with it.
I would've rather have seen that.

974
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:00,920
No Man.
What does that mean?

975
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:02,760
That's a weird thing,
man.

976
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:06,460
You can't because it's been said to that
get spicy talk,

977
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:09,270
but you can't just add stuff.
My wife

978
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:15,750
an art piece like Bohemian rhapsody,
although it is an art piece,

979
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:18,390
it's a documentary of a guy's life.

980
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:22,260
Like in some ways you're documenting it
right?

981
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:25,410
Like it's supposed to be his life,
you can't make up things that never

982
00:46:25,411 --> 00:46:28,010
really happened or I forget what movie,
but it's like a,

983
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,350
it's the difference between like a bio
pic and an actual biography or

984
00:46:31,351 --> 00:46:34,260
documentary.
Like what is the difference you're

985
00:46:34,261 --> 00:46:37,020
making a Hollywood movie versus.
But what is the difference in terms of

986
00:46:37,021 --> 00:46:39,370
the story creative?
I think creative control.

987
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,020
I like being creative with some.
Like we know this event happened in this

988
00:46:43,021 --> 00:46:44,640
event,
happened that day before and in the

989
00:46:44,641 --> 00:46:47,250
middle.
What would happen where one one is

990
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:51,030
knowing all the facts,
the foxcatcher versus a documentary

991
00:46:51,031 --> 00:46:54,060
about Mark Schultz parts in there that
you specifically know.

992
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:57,520
Yes,
we're fucked with for no resistance

993
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:00,060
sake.
Not just the parts that I know,

994
00:47:00,061 --> 00:47:02,250
but I didn't even talk to mark about the
movie,

995
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:05,160
but there was a bunch of parts that I
think he was furious about where it made

996
00:47:05,161 --> 00:47:08,400
it look like they were doing blow and
maybe doing some gay stuff.

997
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,640
It looked,
it was,

998
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:10,230
uh,
it was,

999
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:14,670
there was a lot of weird scenes that
things were implied or just seemed odd.

1000
00:47:14,671 --> 00:47:16,380
Like,
how do you know this happened in less

1001
00:47:16,381 --> 00:47:17,680
mark told you?
And so,

1002
00:47:17,681 --> 00:47:20,190
and mark was furious at the end,
uh,

1003
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:22,230
after it was released.
And then on top of that,

1004
00:47:22,231 --> 00:47:26,280
I like the big one was that they changed
his opponent when he fought in the UFC.

1005
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:30,160
They gave him a Russian guy when he in
fact fought big daddy

1006
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:35,160
goodrich who's a legend,
like big daddy goodrich's an MMA legend.

1007
00:47:35,861 --> 00:47:38,180
He was a pioneer.
He was in the early UFC,

1008
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:41,230
the giant yoked black dude with the
Geeky.

1009
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,280
I mean he would fight with the guy.
He has one of the most brutal knockouts

1010
00:47:45,281 --> 00:47:48,700
in the history of the sport where he
fought this wrestle.

1011
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:53,760
Paul Herrera and Paul took him down and
they got into a position where a big

1012
00:47:55,271 --> 00:48:00,271
daddy goodrich was lying on him sideways
and he elbowed him in the face like 10

1013
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:04,690
times in the course of like three
seconds.

1014
00:48:04,691 --> 00:48:07,810
And it's so horrific.
You watching his head just bounce off

1015
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:11,620
before they stopped the fight.
It's fucking brutal.

1016
00:48:11,621 --> 00:48:14,500
Like one of the most brutal Kales you'll
ever see in your life.

1017
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:19,980
So this guy wasn't a just a regular guy
like you just substitute them out and

1018
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:23,170
make the guys named Tom Instead of Bob.
No,

1019
00:48:23,171 --> 00:48:24,490
it was big daddy goodrich.

1020
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,580
That's who mark Schultz fought when he
fought in the UFC.

1021
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:28,930
Watch this,
watch this.

1022
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:29,651
Boom,
boom,

1023
00:48:29,651 --> 00:48:30,700
boom,
boom,

1024
00:48:30,701 --> 00:48:31,421
boom,
boom,

1025
00:48:31,421 --> 00:48:36,421
boom.
I mean that guy is cop out and his arms

1026
00:48:37,361 --> 00:48:38,740
are trapped in his legs.
A trap.

1027
00:48:38,741 --> 00:48:43,741
Big Daddy's got him in like a,
a like a crucifix position and it's from

1028
00:48:43,871 --> 00:48:47,470
Paul tried to take him down.
I mean that was a.

1029
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:51,280
So that guy,
big daddy goodrich is a.

1030
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:55,570
he's a famous fighter.
It's not like they took some nobody and

1031
00:48:55,571 --> 00:48:58,930
removed him from the movie and changed
the name of someone where it was.

1032
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,560
It didn't really matter.
It was a historical event in mma.

1033
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:04,140
That's the reason anything.

1034
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,060
No one knows.
Some crazy producer.

1035
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:09,120
I think you should fight the Russian guy
because this is.

1036
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,460
We're in the cold war again baby.
I don't know.

1037
00:49:11,461 --> 00:49:15,210
You boot and I don't know how you feel
about politics and some producer.

1038
00:49:15,211 --> 00:49:18,990
Just one of the judges on the soup.
Some writer just wanted to cup his own

1039
00:49:18,991 --> 00:49:21,510
balls,
squirt one off into the fucking stew.

1040
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:23,820
That's probably what happened.
Yeah,

1041
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,640
the screenplay to make it to watch
better.

1042
00:49:26,641 --> 00:49:28,110
Who knows?
The only other thing that makes sense is

1043
00:49:28,111 --> 00:49:30,380
maybe they would've had to pay get daddy
goodrich.

1044
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:32,010
Right.
And they didn't want to pay him.

1045
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:34,650
Maybe.
I don't know if that makes sense.

1046
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,270
That makes sense.
I mean like Mike Tyson,

1047
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,730
you know,
he had that video game a long time ago

1048
00:49:39,731 --> 00:49:44,190
with Nintendo and they had to pay him to
use Mike Tyson's punch in,

1049
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:47,370
punch out and then after like a couple
of years he was like,

1050
00:49:47,371 --> 00:49:48,690
I hadn't done like this in.

1051
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,340
So now it didn't.
It was just called punch out.

1052
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:52,030
It wasn't even Mike Tyson in the game
anymore day.

1053
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,730
Like take it off.
Some new dude.

1054
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:57,690
Yeah.
Have you done the Vr boxing game yet?

1055
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,510
I haven't done the Vr boxing game,
but it looks cool.

1056
00:50:00,511 --> 00:50:02,360
Like the rocky one.
Is that what it is,

1057
00:50:02,361 --> 00:50:04,170
is a whole bunch.
A whole bunch of them too.

1058
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,520
They're amazing.
Yeah.

1059
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:09,300
It's like a regular boxing game.
You playing on TV is so stupid.

1060
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,600
I mean they're fun,
but in comparison to a vr game,

1061
00:50:12,601 --> 00:50:14,100
in a Vr game,
you're boxing,

1062
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,350
you're,
you see your hands in front of you,

1063
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,510
the guy's throwing jabs,
you're slipping,

1064
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:21,630
you're like standing in front of them.
You can catch punches with your hands,

1065
00:50:21,631 --> 00:50:23,850
you can throw shots to the body.
It's crazy.

1066
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:26,850
You get tired doing it.
Like you could really get a workout

1067
00:50:26,851 --> 00:50:28,040
doing it.
It's amazing.

1068
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,640
And this is it right here.
Like this,

1069
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,640
what you had sent us,
the new rocky when they just updated

1070
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:37,130
clubber Lang.
Mr. T's in it or is it just random guy

1071
00:50:37,131 --> 00:50:38,000
with Mohawk?
Well,

1072
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:39,430
that's clubber Lang.
But look,

1073
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:43,280
look how everybody is.
Imagine if people were really that Jack

1074
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,520
Town.
I mean this is.

1075
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:48,950
So what does that Drago and he's
fighting.

1076
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:50,530
There's drago versus rocky.
Yeah.

1077
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:53,180
But we can't see.
You want to see what it looks like from

1078
00:50:53,181 --> 00:50:55,040
your eyes.
And this is a,

1079
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:58,310
um,
that's a regular video game or that is

1080
00:50:58,311 --> 00:51:00,830
just for testing of the.
And this is just a teaser that showed.

1081
00:51:00,831 --> 00:51:04,850
I guess I was looking for the updated.
You want to see what it looks like when

1082
00:51:04,851 --> 00:51:07,760
you've got those gloves in front of you.
Have you tried Vr pull yet?

1083
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:08,870
No.
No,

1084
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:11,150
no.
I like regular pool.

1085
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,070
Vr are so great.

1086
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:16,130
I love it.
I just need to get it out of my living

1087
00:51:16,131 --> 00:51:18,050
room.
It's just too much for my living.

1088
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:22,610
There's things that you couldn't do with
Vr pool that you need to understand.

1089
00:51:22,611 --> 00:51:24,950
If you're actually playing pool with
real pool,

1090
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:26,210
you need friction.
Wow.

1091
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:29,300
This looks great.
It's crazy because it looks nice.

1092
00:51:29,301 --> 00:51:33,720
It looks a little bit of haptic feedback
for this to get maybe the next step to

1093
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:37,790
look how he's using his hands to block
too crazy.

1094
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,050
The thing is,
man,

1095
00:51:39,051 --> 00:51:42,800
when when someone swinging on you,
when this fake person in front of his

1096
00:51:42,801 --> 00:51:43,970
friends,
it's nerve wracking.

1097
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:47,750
You think you're going to get hit and
when you do get hit and you see red

1098
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:50,220
where you see white rather,
you just killed them.

1099
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:54,710
It's funny watching the guy.
It's pretty amazing how vr really gets

1100
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:58,850
immersive like where you were like the
resident evil video game.

1101
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:00,470
I mean,
that's scary as fuck.

1102
00:52:00,471 --> 00:52:02,390
You really think zombies are coming
after you.

1103
00:52:02,391 --> 00:52:02,991
You.
Yeah.

1104
00:52:02,991 --> 00:52:04,790
You really do.
You know that game.

1105
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:06,960
The thing about that game though,
it doesn't necessarily.

1106
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,280
Boxing thing does not necessarily reward
perfect technique.

1107
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:13,610
It's just you could kind of just do this
and do that.

1108
00:52:13,611 --> 00:52:16,190
So you'd have to like be.
If you wanted to use it as a workout,

1109
00:52:16,191 --> 00:52:19,100
you'd have to actually be disciplined
and use good technique.

1110
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:24,140
Well you'd probably do is put gloves on,
put some velcro gloves on and put the,

1111
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:27,220
the,
the little fucking hand thing glove

1112
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,350
close to.
They're better than the next year.

1113
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,340
Two.
You can just duck tape it year or two.

1114
00:52:31,341 --> 00:52:33,270
It'll be in the glove itself.
Yeah,

1115
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,660
there's actually a,
I think it's called the knuckle

1116
00:52:35,661 --> 00:52:37,730
controller is the next version of the
vive controller.

1117
00:52:37,731 --> 00:52:42,060
It fits around your hand like a glove.
It's not just goes around your neck if

1118
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,610
you don't have to grab sort of in the
same way.

1119
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:45,350
Right?
Yeah.

1120
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:48,020
Cause um,
when you have your hands this way,

1121
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:53,300
like with thumbs up,
thumbs up shows the gloves like this on

1122
00:52:53,301 --> 00:52:57,050
the screen for some strange reason.
So when you're throwing punches,

1123
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:59,840
it doesn't look right,
they need to change that,

1124
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:01,220
but other,
because they,

1125
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:05,180
it's like they want you to just do this,
but that's freaking me out.

1126
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:08,150
But when you're actually doing it
though,

1127
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:11,240
if it looked like your hands in the same
position as your hands,

1128
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:15,410
it would be a worthwhile way to learn.
Like a guy like Freddy Roach could

1129
00:53:15,411 --> 00:53:18,110
literally do a game where he showed you,
all right,

1130
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:20,330
I want to see the gap right here,
right here,

1131
00:53:20,331 --> 00:53:22,070
right pop.
And then here comes the hook,

1132
00:53:22,071 --> 00:53:23,900
duck under,
and then we'll go to the body,

1133
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:26,400
go to the head,
and you could do that and do drills

1134
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,250
with a guy.
And actually you could pick up real

1135
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:32,280
skills in a vr game,
especially with boxing,

1136
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:35,780
boxing,
particularly kickboxing,

1137
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:38,610
maybe a little less because you're
moving your legs,

1138
00:53:38,611 --> 00:53:41,160
you're not just moving your hands,
like you'd have to have some sort of

1139
00:53:41,161 --> 00:53:43,830
sensors on your legs so I can know what
you're doing to make sure you're not

1140
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:47,190
showing bad technique.
Like your knee might be down or you

1141
00:53:47,191 --> 00:53:51,030
might be doing something funky.
But if you have boxing,

1142
00:53:51,031 --> 00:53:55,230
those two things are just like gloves,
all you need to learn as all the other

1143
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:57,750
things you need to learn how to punch it
out and move around,

1144
00:53:57,751 --> 00:54:01,590
but you can effectively with just
holding onto those things,

1145
00:54:01,591 --> 00:54:03,420
you're,
you're staying in the same position that

1146
00:54:03,421 --> 00:54:06,900
you would be if you were really boxing
and you can move around the ring too.

1147
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:09,600
Like it's a,
it's an area like the size of this desk

1148
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:13,410
maybe like a little bit more so it's not
like you're in one place and you don't

1149
00:54:13,411 --> 00:54:15,300
have footwork.
You could actually develop footwork too,

1150
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:19,050
so they can have like a facility Loma
Chanko doing like footwell drills,

1151
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:22,980
footwork drills rather where you would
learn on a virtual reality thing,

1152
00:54:22,981 --> 00:54:25,290
where to step,
that'd be fucking bad ass.

1153
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:28,620
All that stuff that you could learn some
shit from those things.

1154
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:34,300
I like how the Vr is.
There's an amusement park or a buildings

1155
00:54:34,611 --> 00:54:35,990
now,
kind of like chuck e cheese where it's

1156
00:54:35,991 --> 00:54:38,330
just vr rides now we're just like,
oh,

1157
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:41,330
you're a parachuting or you're on a
rollercoaster and stuff.

1158
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:44,180
I like how they're doing that now.
A lot of malls have that

1159
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:45,011
now.
Yeah.

1160
00:54:45,011 --> 00:54:45,970
Yeah.
I've done those.

1161
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:49,870
I've done the little spaceship ones too.
When you roll a Dune buggy around on the

1162
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:50,823
surface of that.

1163
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:52,890
Have you done the star wars one in Vegas
yet?

1164
00:54:52,891 --> 00:54:57,030
I guess you actually have like five
people in your group that you can see in

1165
00:54:57,031 --> 00:54:59,200
the game and there's like a,
you know.

1166
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:01,080
Have you played at the Glendale
Galleria?

1167
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:02,120
They do,
yeah.

1168
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,520
Do the dopest one they have.
Is that the Disney land?

1169
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:09,240
The same Disneyland village,
but the Disneyland village one is.

1170
00:55:09,241 --> 00:55:13,710
There's a start star wars one and then
there's also a wreck it Ralph one.

1171
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:16,140
The record.
Ralph one is fucking amazing.

1172
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:18,810
Is the same company avoid?
Well yeah,

1173
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,190
that's it.
Same place.

1174
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,880
So they have the star wars one
sometimes,

1175
00:55:22,881 --> 00:55:26,640
so they'll have like one game set up for
like a couple of weeks and then they'll

1176
00:55:26,641 --> 00:55:28,920
have the other game.
We went to Disneyland and that was the

1177
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:30,460
dopest thing.
It didn't really.

1178
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,770
Yes.
By far.

1179
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:35,580
Fucking amazing dude.
You wear the suit.

1180
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,290
Okay.
So you have this vest on,

1181
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:40,680
so you're feeling when you get hit,
you feel in your chest,

1182
00:55:40,681 --> 00:55:43,290
you feel heat.
They have moved places where you walk

1183
00:55:43,291 --> 00:55:47,370
through and it's like lava below you.
You feel he was the star wars one.

1184
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:49,650
When you're getting shot,
you feel it in your chest.

1185
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,350
No Shit.
You pick the gun up off the wall and

1186
00:55:52,351 --> 00:55:55,230
you've got like storm trooper arms.
You see you're holding the gun in front

1187
00:55:55,231 --> 00:55:56,080
of you.
It's crazy.

1188
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,470
Awesome.
I didn't know that was in Glendale do.

1189
00:55:58,471 --> 00:56:00,390
They're getting so good.
This still.

1190
00:56:00,391 --> 00:56:03,990
You still are super aware that you're in
a game for now.

1191
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:05,131
But this,
you know,

1192
00:56:05,131 --> 00:56:10,131
go from Pong to fucking what's the best
red dead redemption.

1193
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:13,410
That's probably the best graphics.
I mean fucking insane graphics.

1194
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:17,940
That's what does that 30 years,
30 years they went to that these virtual

1195
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:20,550
reality games,
10 years from now are going to be

1196
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:24,190
insane.
No one's gonna want be in regular life.

1197
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,800
Regular life's going to suck.
Yeah.

1198
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:28,870
There's not going to be at Disneyland or
Disney world anymore.

1199
00:56:28,871 --> 00:56:31,600
It's just going to be vr.
It'll still be there,

1200
00:56:31,601 --> 00:56:33,160
but you'll be able to get on every ride.

1201
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:39,170
I haven't watched this myself yet,
but the MBA makes a viewing and vr

1202
00:56:39,171 --> 00:56:42,560
available now.
Not every game,

1203
00:56:42,561 --> 00:56:45,140
but it's like once a week they have a
particular game you can.

1204
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:49,310
You can log in and watch that.
They changed the cameras a little bit.

1205
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:52,220
I don't think it's perfect yet.
Holy Shit.

1206
00:56:52,221 --> 00:56:53,670
Very cool though,
Dude.

1207
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:57,140
Like watching this on the floor.
You're on the floor and they'll.

1208
00:56:57,141 --> 00:56:59,660
But they'll move you around so you can
sear in the footage to it.

1209
00:56:59,661 --> 00:57:01,880
I think they have a separate announcing
team,

1210
00:57:01,881 --> 00:57:03,800
so they're.
They're talking about what you're seeing

1211
00:57:03,801 --> 00:57:07,550
versus like listening to the normal TV.
Quite not there yet.

1212
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:11,660
We filmed a couple episodes of kill Tony
and Vr and we had some of the top of the

1213
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:14,900
line cameras for it and still wasn't
there yet.

1214
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,820
It was more hassle than it was worth.

1215
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:21,170
This seems like something that would be
fucking amazing for the UFC though.

1216
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:24,050
Oh yeah.
I mean this would be a major basically

1217
00:57:24,051 --> 00:57:26,030
have your view.
Yeah,

1218
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,380
except you.
The cage.

1219
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:29,480
The cage would be in the way,
but there's gotta be a way that they

1220
00:57:29,481 --> 00:57:34,481
could film through the cage if they just
had a camera in a reinforced position

1221
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:41,380
where it was far enough back behind foam
that there's no way it could interfere

1222
00:57:43,311 --> 00:57:46,910
if someone crashed into it but yet close
enough that it could see through an

1223
00:57:46,911 --> 00:57:50,960
actual hole.
You could get the entire octagon if you

1224
00:57:50,961 --> 00:57:53,180
did it with several.
Several different ones.

1225
00:57:53,181 --> 00:57:53,620
Are those

1226
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:56,500
they had or they had it at least at
this,

1227
00:57:56,501 --> 00:57:57,131
isn't it?
I guess,

1228
00:57:57,131 --> 00:57:59,210
but it was a ground level.
I think they call it the Phantom Cam,

1229
00:57:59,211 --> 00:58:01,420
but maybe it had a different name and it
was vr.

1230
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:04,090
It wasn't vr.
Know the UFC is used it a few times.

1231
00:58:04,091 --> 00:58:06,430
They always try out things there.
They're very experimental.

1232
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,320
They don't always show everything
they're trying out though.

1233
00:58:08,321 --> 00:58:09,970
But problem with.
Cool to try.

1234
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:12,700
Maybe one time.
Ideally you'd want it right in the

1235
00:58:12,701 --> 00:58:16,870
middle.
Like not above or two below.

1236
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:19,090
Okay.
And it would have to have because it has

1237
00:58:19,091 --> 00:58:20,560
cameras all around it.
So

1238
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:22,840
you know.

1239
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:28,980
Now that's hard to do with the cameras.
I guess a without getting in the way,

1240
00:58:28,981 --> 00:58:29,814
if everything.

1241
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:33,600
Yeah,
you'd have to.

1242
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:38,710
You'd have to find a good spot for it,
put it on a burst buffers head and let

1243
00:58:38,711 --> 00:58:39,471
him just go to town.
Well,

1244
00:58:39,471 --> 00:58:42,710
they used to do that with pride.
Pride used to have like they would wear

1245
00:58:42,711 --> 00:58:46,670
glasses with like cameras next to the
glasses and you'd get the referee

1246
00:58:46,671 --> 00:58:47,630
vision.
Yeah.

1247
00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:51,110
It was crazy.
It's cool separating fighters and

1248
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:53,660
breaking it up and waving the fight off.
Yeah,

1249
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,960
that's Kinda cool.
Yeah,

1250
00:58:54,961 --> 00:58:56,480
it's pretty bad ass.
Yeah,

1251
00:58:57,050 --> 00:58:58,300
it is.
It's A.

1252
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,830
I guess it's just a little team.
Marshall camp is what?

1253
00:59:00,831 --> 00:59:03,830
It's going Pov Cam,
but that's just point at me,

1254
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:05,920
man.
Sometimes.

1255
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:07,490
Yeah.
There's one like that that's pointed at

1256
00:59:07,491 --> 00:59:08,480
me.
Oh yeah.

1257
00:59:08,481 --> 00:59:08,910
I guess.
Sure.

1258
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:10,100
I have seen that there.
Yeah,

1259
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:15,290
they use that sometimes when you know,
when we go crazy when we jump up fights

1260
00:59:15,291 --> 00:59:18,020
happening.
I didn't know that was even.

1261
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:21,560
I didn't know that's what they did it
for until one day I saw online.

1262
00:59:21,561 --> 00:59:21,990
I go,
oh,

1263
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:24,680
that makes sense.
That's a smart thing to do because

1264
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:28,190
sometimes we do get animated.
There's been several fights were me,

1265
00:59:28,191 --> 00:59:31,910
anik and DC or dominick Cruz.
We're all standing up like,

1266
00:59:31,911 --> 00:59:32,960
well,
while the like the end,

1267
00:59:32,961 --> 00:59:36,110
like Amanda Nunez when Amanda Nunez
knocked out Cris Cyborg,

1268
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:37,580
we just,
we were like,

1269
00:59:37,581 --> 00:59:40,700
what?
Like your whole body is like,

1270
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:44,570
she's us.
What the fuck did I just say?

1271
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:46,840
Sometimes you just can't sit down.
You just,

1272
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:50,960
your buys just like God damn it.
It just goes.

1273
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:53,140
You don't,
you're not even trying to control it and

1274
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,990
you just let it go.
When you see somebody do something

1275
00:59:56,991 --> 01:00:01,370
fucking insane.
Like there's some wild crazy francis in

1276
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:04,280
Ghana knocking out Alistair overeem type
punch.

1277
01:00:04,281 --> 01:00:05,114
Yeah.

1278
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:09,860
Yeah.
It's me and Dominic and John Eck and

1279
01:00:09,861 --> 01:00:13,690
annex up and I'm leaning back.
It's crazy job,

1280
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:15,350
man.
It's crazy job.

1281
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:19,790
So that was the moment.
And you see the one below it.

1282
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,860
See that?
Go back to that.

1283
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:25,730
So that one below it where I'm staring
at the camera in the upper right.

1284
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:30,710
I know that froze up video taken by John
Wayne.

1285
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:34,070
Par.
John Wayne Parr who is a multiple time

1286
01:00:34,071 --> 01:00:37,850
world champion and friend of mine,
a great guy who lives in Australia,

1287
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,930
was there at the fights in Australia
when Holly Holm knocked out Ronda Rousey

1288
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:47,110
and he filmed Holly Holm head kicking
Ronda Rousey and then turns to me and I

1289
01:00:47,121 --> 01:00:50,780
turned to him and I was like,
what the fuck just happened?

1290
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:53,870
I was like,
Whoa,

1291
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:56,720
whoa.
But when you see it,

1292
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:00,260
like in that moment when you see,
when you see something that,

1293
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:02,750
that fucking nuts in that moment,
you're like,

1294
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:04,320
oh,
I can't even believe what I saw.

1295
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:07,160
That was mailer.
I looked at him and he looked at me and

1296
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:08,360
were like,
Whoa,

1297
01:01:08,361 --> 01:01:11,660
dude.
That was crazy.

1298
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:17,120
There's no sport like that.
Some sports just,

1299
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:22,760
you know,
they just have this moment where

1300
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:26,180
everybody gets a jolt of a drug.
You know?

1301
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:29,350
Everybody just gets it.
I mean,

1302
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,340
that didn't happen last night at the
Super Bowl for you.

1303
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:34,430
I left before it ended.
I was at a friend's party,

1304
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:36,410
went to a superbowl party.
It was fun.

1305
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:39,140
The lowest viewed one in the last 10
years.

1306
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:40,610
Are you serious?
But not by a lot,

1307
01:01:40,611 --> 01:01:42,620
but yeah,
it's because they knew that that

1308
01:01:42,621 --> 01:01:44,180
handsome man was going to take your
shirt off.

1309
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:46,980
Oh Levine.
It's beautiful man.

1310
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,390
No nipples,
nipples.

1311
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,690
Now he has a Nice Brown Nicholas.
But then we're like Janet Jackson,

1312
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:56,990
like the big crazy.
Why is he loved shows nipples.

1313
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,520
So both.
This is bullshit,

1314
01:01:58,521 --> 01:02:00,470
sexist bullshit.
And his Dick Route.

1315
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:01,850
This is.
Oh my God.

1316
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:04,550
He had decreased showing God is
bullshit.

1317
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:06,590
He just wanted.
Everybody knows he's got beautiful

1318
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:11,300
tattoos and a fairly good body.
Doesn't move.

1319
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:12,500
He does a lot of squats though.
Right?

1320
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:16,580
That's what's interesting.
He's around like the greatest super

1321
01:02:16,581 --> 01:02:18,320
athletes in the known universe.
Actually.

1322
01:02:18,321 --> 01:02:20,130
It was pretty good.
Right for

1323
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:22,850
today.
He was pretty good in those.

1324
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:24,820
Random for today was.
I mean,

1325
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:26,670
he's not always around the greatest
super athletes,

1326
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:27,720
right?
No,

1327
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:28,141
no.
Yeah,

1328
01:02:28,141 --> 01:02:29,580
yeah.
Um,

1329
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:30,710
yeah.
It looks pretty good.

1330
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:33,390
It looks like he's in good shape.
Happy to take your shirt off with this

1331
01:02:33,391 --> 01:02:38,330
California stomach tattoo.
But the point being that guy is around,

1332
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:44,960
he's around six foot five,
290 pounds super athletes who could jump

1333
01:02:45,451 --> 01:02:49,440
over his fucking head.
They literally could run through 100 of

1334
01:02:49,441 --> 01:02:51,600
him,
like they were paper walls,

1335
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:54,210
just raw.
That's what he's around.

1336
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:59,330
He's around the fucking super bowl,
the greatest physical specimens in the

1337
01:03:00,811 --> 01:03:04,150
known universe.
And he takes his shirt off like,

1338
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,370
hey bitches,
I'm here to.

1339
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,470
They had an event set up over the
weekend.

1340
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:11,190
Uh,
some people could test their 40 speed up

1341
01:03:11,191 --> 01:03:12,510
against other NFL teams,
whatever.

1342
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:15,720
They had this hilarious Hussein bolt did
it and it's in his shoes.

1343
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:18,450
They said street shoes or whatever.
But she didn't have cleats on.

1344
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:20,880
He tied the fastest ever.
NFL 40.

1345
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:25,170
He's probably did with a full stomach.
It probably just a track a couple of

1346
01:03:25,171 --> 01:03:26,070
beers.
Fuck it.

1347
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:27,480
I'll show these bitches what's up?

1348
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:30,780
Yeah.
It's just,

1349
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:33,900
it was weird like watching on tv,
it's due to shirt off,

1350
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:35,431
like,
oh,

1351
01:03:35,431 --> 01:03:38,600
this is a different thing now.
Now this is like a sexy concert for.

1352
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:41,370
It was like a football and that's what I
think he's getting shit for it because

1353
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,740
he didn't need to take a shirt off.
Right.

1354
01:03:43,741 --> 01:03:44,201
You know,
he,

1355
01:03:44,201 --> 01:03:46,080
he,
he had his shirt on and then like after

1356
01:03:46,081 --> 01:03:46,891
the second songs,
like,

1357
01:03:46,891 --> 01:03:48,990
you know what,
let's get sexy in the super bowl.

1358
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,100
No,
no,

1359
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,230
but I mean,
why else would you take this shirt?

1360
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:56,730
At least make it Hashtag.
Hashtag sexy in the superbowl.

1361
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:59,810
Gets sexy up in this bitch.
Well,

1362
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:01,650
he's a sexy man.
Can't,

1363
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,270
don't be hating.
Beautiful Man.

1364
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:04,590
Yeah,
I mean,

1365
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:06,450
but.
But that's the whole thing that your

1366
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:11,030
audience is a bunch of guys jacket on
with Jack and on.

1367
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,330
Well,
it was cold out at first,

1368
01:04:12,331 --> 01:04:13,680
but then he started to warm up a sweat.

1369
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:19,290
Never trust white men with Nicholas's.
That's my message for the one now he's

1370
01:04:19,291 --> 01:04:23,200
got the little necklaces and the
bracelets for the falcons land on.

1371
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:25,110
Wait a minute.
Those are spiritual Nicholas's.

1372
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:28,830
If you have wooden beads for whatever
reason that makes you spiritual hemp or

1373
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:30,930
gold.
I can't even tell you allowed to wear

1374
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,090
necklaces because like people go,
oh,

1375
01:04:33,091 --> 01:04:36,780
you like really indoor ganache stuff
really into macro,

1376
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:39,680
but that's gold is gold.
Yeah.

1377
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,150
That's the other one was just a weird
lighting.

1378
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,260
I can't wear necklaces,
man.

1379
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,620
It bugs me.
Did you ever wear necklaces?

1380
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:48,150
Necklaces?
Sure.

1381
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:49,920
Yeah.
It's never been a staple,

1382
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:51,660
but it's a,
it's a,

1383
01:04:51,730 --> 01:04:54,090
it's a weird thing if,
first of all,

1384
01:04:54,091 --> 01:04:55,740
if it's,
if it's big enough,

1385
01:04:55,741 --> 01:04:57,060
it's like this target,
right?

1386
01:04:57,061 --> 01:05:00,030
If you have like a bill gold necklace,
people want to steal it.

1387
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:02,160
Right?
There's a lot of Nicholas snatchers out

1388
01:05:02,161 --> 01:05:02,310
there.

1389
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:03,360
Brian,
I don't know if you know that.

1390
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:05,370
Yeah.
But then the other thing is,

1391
01:05:05,371 --> 01:05:07,230
uh,
like what are you doing?

1392
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:10,320
We're doing with that big old shiny
thing around your neck.

1393
01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:10,921
Are you doing.
What?

1394
01:05:10,921 --> 01:05:12,630
Are you a chick?
Remember it in the nineties,

1395
01:05:12,631 --> 01:05:15,510
chokers were thing and I used to wear a
choker.

1396
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:17,760
How gross is that?
Like dog choker,

1397
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:20,670
just a really tight necklace.
Yeah,

1398
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,290
hemp necklaces.
Oh yeah.

1399
01:05:23,291 --> 01:05:25,690
Those were the little bead.
The bead at the bottom.

1400
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:26,770
The beads.
Critical.

1401
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:28,010
Kind of have the bead.
Yeah,

1402
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,610
multicolored bead.
Think over.

1403
01:05:30,611 --> 01:05:32,350
You're cool.
Yeah.

1404
01:05:32,351 --> 01:05:33,000
Like,
it's weird,

1405
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,620
like,
like some guys will wear like little

1406
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:40,690
anklets with beads and they tie them off
and they'll walk around barefoot and

1407
01:05:40,691 --> 01:05:41,830
you're like,
okay,

1408
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:45,130
what's kind of like that?
Look that you're not shop.

1409
01:05:45,131 --> 01:05:46,840
Look where you have like the really
tight,

1410
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,810
like your pants go up so you can see
your socks,

1411
01:05:49,811 --> 01:05:51,190
you know,
you show a little leg.

1412
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:55,110
You know why they do that or sneakers.
Those guys show off the sneakers.

1413
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:57,760
False.
That's what she told me to do that

1414
01:05:57,761 --> 01:05:59,950
Jamie.
That's what my parents have that

1415
01:05:59,951 --> 01:06:00,784
actually for it.

1416
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:06,280
That's how the uh,
that's funny.

1417
01:06:06,281 --> 01:06:08,740
That's how the pants are made.
You don't buy those pants,

1418
01:06:08,741 --> 01:06:10,540
man,
that you're not buying pants.

1419
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:12,850
Where do you buy your parents?
Lady store.

1420
01:06:12,851 --> 01:06:14,170
Do you buy?
Do you buy it at coach?

1421
01:06:14,171 --> 01:06:15,700
Do you buy those pants?
Icu Doc on?

1422
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,530
Gosh,
that's hilarious.

1423
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:18,820
Do you don't do that too?
You know?

1424
01:06:18,821 --> 01:06:22,870
How dare you,
how dare you have a pair of a very

1425
01:06:22,871 --> 01:06:25,630
comfortable underarmor running shoes on?
How are those trouble?

1426
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,740
That was in your shoes the other day.
Um,

1427
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,750
they're a little too tight for me.
Okay.

1428
01:06:30,130 --> 01:06:33,190
They bind my feet a tad bit.
When I got to the store,

1429
01:06:33,191 --> 01:06:36,700
I had to swap them out for A.
I had a pair of converse all stars,

1430
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:38,830
which you might go to.
You Got Yeezys right?

1431
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:43,830
Jamie gave me a pair of yeezys about a
year ago and he just to talk to them.

1432
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,530
You just keeping them on ice dead.

1433
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:47,470
Socked him.
Is that always called that stock dead

1434
01:06:47,471 --> 01:06:48,850
stock.
Dead stock.

1435
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,440
Oh.
Do you know a dead naming is?

1436
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:52,650
Do you know what dead naming is of?
No,

1437
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:54,730
no,
it's a new thing that's illegal on

1438
01:06:54,731 --> 01:06:57,370
twitter.
It just something I wish I knew I didn't

1439
01:06:57,371 --> 01:07:02,300
know until after the podcast,
but dead naming is a.

1440
01:07:02,330 --> 01:07:05,530
it's banned.
So say if you decided tomorrow to become

1441
01:07:05,531 --> 01:07:07,800
a woman and you're like,
I'm not no longer Bryan.

1442
01:07:07,801 --> 01:07:12,180
I'm Bryan INA Brianna.
That's what have you thought the

1443
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:14,290
servers.
So I'd be like,

1444
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:15,790
okay,
Brianna,

1445
01:07:15,791 --> 01:07:17,710
but you're still a man.
And then boom,

1446
01:07:17,711 --> 01:07:22,711
that's deadnaming you can't call someone
something other than their preferred

1447
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:28,750
gender.
So like if that identify as a woman,

1448
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:33,340
but their biologically male,
you're not allowed to say their

1449
01:07:33,341 --> 01:07:35,090
biologically male,
uh,

1450
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:39,270
you're not allowed to call them a man
because that's deadnaming.

1451
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,510
You not allowed to call them.

1452
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:43,000
Like you couldn't call Caitlyn Jenner.
Bruce.

1453
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:46,720
If you called her bruce,
you'd be dead naming her.

1454
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:50,480
But that's just like,
that's not illegal or I mean like,

1455
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:52,740
oh,
it's winter rule.

1456
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:55,090
If it is a new poll,
please pull that up.

1457
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,320
I did not know this.
I did not know this.

1458
01:07:57,710 --> 01:07:59,060
It.
It's been around for awhile,

1459
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,700
but I'm checking the twitter.
That's kind of weird.

1460
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:02,610
Dead Name.
He has been banned for a while or don't

1461
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:04,090
know.
The term term has been around.

1462
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:08,480
I just found out about the term maybe a
couple weeks ago.

1463
01:08:08,481 --> 01:08:12,790
I had heard the term for the first time
somebody wrote dead naming and I was

1464
01:08:12,791 --> 01:08:13,480
like,
what?

1465
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:14,980
What is that?
And then I had to look it up.

1466
01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:19,130
I saw the new rules.
We have to deal with that fucking

1467
01:08:19,131 --> 01:08:21,260
article.
There's an article that I was reading.

1468
01:08:21,290 --> 01:08:22,790
Go ahead.
I'm looking right at their terms of

1469
01:08:22,791 --> 01:08:24,980
service.
It's directly word for word in there.

1470
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:26,083
Okay.
Where's this?

1471
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:31,790
Okay.
Dead naming of transgender individuals

1472
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:36,770
repeated or nonconsensual slurs or
epithets?

1473
01:08:36,830 --> 01:08:41,830
Racist and sexist tropes or other
content that degrade someone.

1474
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:45,260
Okay.
Well hold on a second.

1475
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,290
Like what does degrade someone?
So if you.

1476
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:51,740
If you contact me and say,
hey bro,

1477
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:53,600
you're fucking short.
You're not funny.

1478
01:08:53,601 --> 01:08:56,840
That's degrading,
like is that not allowed?

1479
01:08:57,860 --> 01:08:58,940
That's crazy.
You have to.

1480
01:08:58,990 --> 01:09:03,050
You have to have that be allowed.
We are targeting individuals with

1481
01:09:03,051 --> 01:09:06,020
repeated slurs,
tropes or other content that it tends to

1482
01:09:06,021 --> 01:09:07,250
dehumanize,
degrade,

1483
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:12,490
or reinforce negative or harmful
stereotypes about a protected category.

1484
01:09:12,711 --> 01:09:13,790
See,
that's where it comes from.

1485
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:19,030
Like white people are not protected.
This includes targeted mis-gendering or

1486
01:09:19,881 --> 01:09:23,630
deadnaming of transgender transgender
individuals.

1487
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:26,420
Oh,
I love how they just went with the giant

1488
01:09:26,421 --> 01:09:30,560
corporation and they just went with some
new word that's only been around for

1489
01:09:30,561 --> 01:09:32,960
like a month.
How long has deadnaming been around for

1490
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:35,600
the urban dictionary?
Had It in there from 2014.

1491
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,300
He never even heard that,
but they're on the ball.

1492
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:41,240
Tell you that,
but you to stay ahead.

1493
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:44,830
Twitter still allows goat season and all
the porn you want.

1494
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:46,310
It was interesting to me.
Yeah.

1495
01:09:46,311 --> 01:09:47,450
Well,
porns consensual.

1496
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,300
I love that.
That's hilarious.

1497
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:51,590
I love that.
That's all.

1498
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:54,920
I love the.
I love the chaos of it all.

1499
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:56,240
I love the fact that

1500
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,750
trying to sort everything out.
I just think it's.

1501
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:02,940
The whole thing is crazy.
It's so bizarre that

1502
01:10:04,930 --> 01:10:08,050
they're trying to,
in that sense with that like that's so

1503
01:10:08,051 --> 01:10:13,051
vague to dehumanize or degrade what
every joke about someone,

1504
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:18,070
every joke about trump,
every single joke about trump that every

1505
01:10:18,071 --> 01:10:23,071
single comedian and slash or commentator
in or person makes is in some way

1506
01:10:23,291 --> 01:10:25,680
degrading.
When you talk about how fucking stupid.

1507
01:10:25,681 --> 01:10:28,000
It's like Rob Reiner had a joke about
him,

1508
01:10:28,001 --> 01:10:32,530
called him a piece of shit or call them
a piece of crap yesterday and said he

1509
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,220
couldn't believe how fucking dumb he is.

1510
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:36,810
Trump talking about hillary though.
He's doing it to him.

1511
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,740
Percent.
One hundred percent.

1512
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:41,320
One hundred percent.
So that's so vague.

1513
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:42,513
That's so vague

1514
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:46,730
and dead naming is not a real word.
So like how are they using fake words in

1515
01:10:46,731 --> 01:10:47,564
this?

1516
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:52,860
They're trying to say it is now.
It is a real real word.

1517
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:57,480
Yeah man.
I don't know if your name used to be

1518
01:10:57,481 --> 01:11:00,960
bruce and you change it to Caitlin.
I can't say that.

1519
01:11:01,650 --> 01:11:05,490
That seems bananas.
That seems bananas.

1520
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:10,580
So like if you're fucking with somebody,
say somebody became a woman and it's

1521
01:11:11,371 --> 01:11:15,480
still an asshole.
Like you can't call him Mike,

1522
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:16,830
you know.
Hey Mike,

1523
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:19,290
look,
I'm sure you're bitter about this whole

1524
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,300
changing your sex thing.
You can't bring that up.

1525
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:23,850
But uh,
you're still an annoying guy.

1526
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:27,660
You just don't have your deck anymore by
like if someone says that they can't say

1527
01:11:27,661 --> 01:11:30,630
that,
why can't they say that they should.

1528
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:32,890
That's to me stupid.
Why?

1529
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:34,500
Well,
I'm not saying that that's hurtful,

1530
01:11:34,501 --> 01:11:39,501
I guess to transgender people and that's
can be considered hate speech or hate

1531
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:46,010
whatever but own.
But only when it comes to like gender,

1532
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:48,750
right?
Like if you could tell someone,

1533
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:52,290
hey,
you're short and fat and stupid and they

1534
01:11:52,291 --> 01:11:53,250
don't.
No one cares.

1535
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:55,543
True.
Right?

1536
01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:57,310
You could say you,
uh,

1537
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:00,140
you're ugly as fuck your noses.
Disgusting.

1538
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:04,820
What happens there?
Is that the same?

1539
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:08,780
What is it the same thing?
It might be if you do it repeatedly,

1540
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:09,750
right?
If,

1541
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:12,440
once you just throw one out there,
probably.

1542
01:12:12,441 --> 01:12:14,690
Okay.
Probably one time you could shit on

1543
01:12:14,691 --> 01:12:17,230
someone's looks.
But it's like what?

1544
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:21,440
Like deciding what you can and shit on
someone for like what I'm saying is if

1545
01:12:21,441 --> 01:12:24,380
someone's an asshole and they're like,
here's a perfect one.

1546
01:12:24,770 --> 01:12:28,760
That woman who used to be a man,
she's transgender woman who was in a

1547
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:32,810
store screaming at this kid behind the
counter that it's ma'am,

1548
01:12:33,070 --> 01:12:35,510
it's man,
this is a perfect example of that guy

1549
01:12:35,511 --> 01:12:38,360
was terrified.
She's fucking huge and she used to be a

1550
01:12:38,361 --> 01:12:42,800
guy and clearly still looks like a guy
and she's saying it's fucking ma'am.

1551
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:45,490
Like you mentioned,
knocked some shit over.

1552
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,560
She got violent.
Yeah.

1553
01:12:48,050 --> 01:12:53,050
In that situation you're telling me that
it's not cool to say,

1554
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:56,930
how about you settle the fuck down
because you look like a guy.

1555
01:12:57,050 --> 01:13:00,020
You're acting like a violent guy and you
used to be a guy.

1556
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:02,420
Pardon me if I think you're still a
fucking guy

1557
01:13:03,290 --> 01:13:06,560
that's deadnaming.
But that's a good thing to say in that

1558
01:13:06,561 --> 01:13:09,380
particular instance.
So without nuance,

1559
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,150
right?
Without context,

1560
01:13:11,690 --> 01:13:14,660
it's saying you can't say anything to
degrade someone.

1561
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:16,550
Well clearly that would degrade that
guy,

1562
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,650
but if that guy was saying,
fuck that kid,

1563
01:13:18,651 --> 01:13:21,140
he did it on purpose.
On twitter you're saying someone can't

1564
01:13:21,141 --> 01:13:22,090
respond,
hey man,

1565
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:25,500
I'm sure you're really upset that you
got your Dick or moved and these still

1566
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:27,590
look your guy,
but fuck you.

1567
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:31,070
Like why can't someone say that?
Because that's people communicating how

1568
01:13:31,071 --> 01:13:34,370
they feel about you being a dick.
Like if you start out being a dick and

1569
01:13:34,371 --> 01:13:37,100
then they communicate about you being a
dick by being a dick as well.

1570
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,590
Are we banning?
This is the product is covering their

1571
01:13:39,591 --> 01:13:42,050
butts and there's probably not like of
like Jamie said,

1572
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:47,140
it's dangerous in a lot of ways.
It's dangerous to control people's

1573
01:13:47,691 --> 01:13:50,900
thoughts and behavior because who are
you to say and when does it end?

1574
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,210
You know?
It just keeps going and going and going

1575
01:13:53,211 --> 01:13:54,080
and going.
It gets.

1576
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:58,700
It gets very slippery when you have one
group that thinks it's right and they're

1577
01:13:58,710 --> 01:14:00,740
trying to control another group that
thinks they're right.

1578
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:03,470
Man,
that is a.

1579
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:06,680
it's.
It seems so simple when you just talk

1580
01:14:06,681 --> 01:14:11,470
about deadnaming transgender people or
not degrading people based on their or

1581
01:14:11,471 --> 01:14:15,310
their ethnicity or their this or that,
but what you're doing is you're trying

1582
01:14:15,311 --> 01:14:18,070
to dictate how humans communicate with
each other and people don't like it when

1583
01:14:18,071 --> 01:14:20,200
you tell them what to do.
The problem with telling people what to

1584
01:14:20,201 --> 01:14:24,400
do is they want to do the exact opposite
is one of the first things you realize

1585
01:14:24,410 --> 01:14:25,870
when you have kids like,
oh,

1586
01:14:25,871 --> 01:14:29,080
they don't want to listen to me.
Like I got to figure out a way to sneak

1587
01:14:29,081 --> 01:14:30,580
information into them.
You know,

1588
01:14:30,581 --> 01:14:34,510
or you gotta you gotta figure out a way
to not be too bossy.

1589
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:36,490
People don't want someone telling them
what to do.

1590
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:40,220
This is what I missed when I was
editing,

1591
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:43,660
headed into that conversation.
I missed how other people looked at that

1592
01:14:43,661 --> 01:14:46,690
guy and what he stands for.
I don't think it's correct.

1593
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:51,250
I think it's way more complicated.
I think it's an insane business to run

1594
01:14:51,251 --> 01:14:54,640
it.
I don't think he really knew why Alex

1595
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,250
Jones was band or anybody else has been.
I don't think he really knew.

1596
01:14:57,251 --> 01:15:01,720
I think he's dealing with a giant
corporation and he's a young guy

1597
01:15:02,350 --> 01:15:04,820
anywhere.
Sandals titling company here.

1598
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:05,591
Wait,
wait.

1599
01:15:05,591 --> 01:15:08,560
What kind of Sandoz is a weird ones.
Like the Nice Guy.

1600
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:12,640
Let's just choose.
He runs a couple of different companies.

1601
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:14,460
He's not.
He's not sitting at twitter office.

1602
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:18,640
That's another thing that Alex Jones
brought up today that he sponsors the

1603
01:15:18,641 --> 01:15:21,340
podcast through the cash app,
which is also.

1604
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:24,310
He also runs 100 percent true,
but I would have,

1605
01:15:24,370 --> 01:15:26,440
and I think we talked about it on the
podcast.

1606
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:29,830
We even talked about the cash app being
a sponsor and about how it's helped.

1607
01:15:29,831 --> 01:15:31,540
Justin wren is fight for the forgotten
charity.

1608
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:35,230
So Alex Jones erroneously said that I
didn't mention it,

1609
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:40,030
so we did mention it.
It's worth mentioning and Alex Jones is

1610
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:45,090
a
having to like respond to people that

1611
01:15:46,631 --> 01:15:51,160
want to know if I've seen what Alex
Jones has said about me lately is one of

1612
01:15:51,161 --> 01:15:56,161
the weird things that I have dealt with
because first of all I've always had

1613
01:15:57,251 --> 01:15:59,920
good dealings with Alex in person,
person to person,

1614
01:16:00,190 --> 01:16:02,110
but he's obviously in a world of shit
right now.

1615
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:06,820
There's a lot going on with him with the
sandy hook stuff and he wasn't entirely

1616
01:16:06,821 --> 01:16:10,360
honest with me about what he had said
about Sandy Hook.

1617
01:16:10,450 --> 01:16:13,360
Maybe he didn't remember.
Maybe a.

1618
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:17,110
He was trying to phrase it in a way
other than the way I interpreted it when

1619
01:16:17,111 --> 01:16:19,870
I saw the videos,
but there is a media matters video that

1620
01:16:19,871 --> 01:16:22,180
shows all the time where he said that
Sandy Hook was fake.

1621
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,580
This is a very complicated.
To me,

1622
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:27,160
this is one of the reasons why I
struggled with bringing him back on the

1623
01:16:27,161 --> 01:16:29,560
podcast.
That's very complicated.

1624
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:33,620
It's that is.
Even though

1625
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:38,830
I've known the guy since 1998 and if I'm
around him,

1626
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:41,200
I'd say that's my friend Alex Jones.
He's a friend.

1627
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:45,580
He's awfully.
He obviously did something fucked up and

1628
01:16:45,581 --> 01:16:47,950
the parents that had to deal with what
he did.

1629
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:51,820
There's parents that had to deal with
people calling them a crisis actor.

1630
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:57,540
They had to deal with people harassing
them at the courthouse and harassing

1631
01:16:58,631 --> 01:17:02,440
them if they met them in public because
they were saying that they were lying

1632
01:17:02,441 --> 01:17:04,690
about their kids being killed.
So not only are their kids being killed,

1633
01:17:04,691 --> 01:17:09,290
but they have to deal with someone
harassing them and saying,

1634
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:14,291
you're a liar and you're enactor.
It's insanity and I wouldn't.

1635
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:16,610
I would think about it differently.

1636
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:19,790
I definitely think about differently if
I wasn't friends with Alex,

1637
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:22,760
but I would also think about it
differently if he hadn't made shit up

1638
01:17:22,761 --> 01:17:27,500
about me.
He said that I was told to stop talking

1639
01:17:27,501 --> 01:17:31,820
about conspiracies are they threatened
my family that's 100 percent horseshit

1640
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:34,700
and he has my phone number he could have
called me.

1641
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:40,180
I called him after I heard about it.
He told me that someone told him that.

1642
01:17:40,371 --> 01:17:42,290
I told.
I talked to the person who told him that

1643
01:17:42,291 --> 01:17:43,730
I'm like,
this is fucking bananas.

1644
01:17:43,731 --> 01:17:45,350
Like you out of your mind,
call me.

1645
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:48,290
This is so stupid.
You think I'm not talking about

1646
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:50,090
whatever.
Fill in the blank.

1647
01:17:50,091 --> 01:17:51,680
Whatever.
Ridiculous conspiracy,

1648
01:17:52,370 --> 01:17:54,600
the rothschilds,
the Rockefeller's,

1649
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:56,960
whatever it is.
I'm not talking about that because the

1650
01:17:56,961 --> 01:17:59,510
government threatened my family.
That is fucking wrong.

1651
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:02,450
It's ridiculous.
And now you've put it out there.

1652
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:07,580
So Alex Jones went on afterwards and he
apologized and corrected it.

1653
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:09,830
Then recently,
because I haven't had him on the

1654
01:18:09,831 --> 01:18:12,560
podcast,
he decided to start saying that I worked

1655
01:18:12,561 --> 01:18:14,510
for the CIA and that,
um,

1656
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:17,270
uh,
George Soros talking points,

1657
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:19,310
which I don't even know what these
fucking talking points,

1658
01:18:19,311 --> 01:18:24,290
our talking points about him and
specific not talking to anybody.

1659
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:27,860
No one's giving me talking points,
not George Soros,

1660
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:30,720
Eddie Bravo has been saying he wasn't
good.

1661
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:33,890
He got good information.
Even say that.

1662
01:18:33,891 --> 01:18:37,150
So stop.
Joey Diaz did fuck with it for awhile

1663
01:18:37,151 --> 01:18:37,760
though.
But,

1664
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:41,750
but the point being,
the point being Alex is you're out

1665
01:18:41,751 --> 01:18:44,960
there.
I still like you as a person.

1666
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:46,730
If I saw you,
I'd still give you a hug,

1667
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:49,670
but you're making shit up.
And this is,

1668
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:53,300
this is not helping anybody wants to
defend you.

1669
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:58,400
It's not helping me as a person.
Talk about the good qualities in you and

1670
01:18:58,401 --> 01:18:59,460
you know,
the,

1671
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:01,520
these things that you're saying are made
up.

1672
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:04,040
You're making up the fact that I'm in
the CIA.

1673
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:08,300
You're making up for the fact that the
Hollywood insiders have given me

1674
01:19:08,301 --> 01:19:10,370
information and tell me what to say.
That's not true.

1675
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:11,570
You know,
it's not true.

1676
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:15,500
You know me.
I don't have time to be a CIA insider.

1677
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:20,450
I can't take on another job and between
doing standup and podcasts and UFC

1678
01:19:20,451 --> 01:19:21,830
commentator,
running a family,

1679
01:19:21,950 --> 01:19:25,400
I can't do it.
I wouldn't do it.

1680
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:29,810
I'm not interested.
I'd rather stop doing everything than

1681
01:19:29,811 --> 01:19:33,350
work for any government organization.
No one's ever approached me.

1682
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:36,140
No one's ever approached anybody I've
ever heard of.

1683
01:19:36,141 --> 01:19:37,910
I don't even know if that really
happens.

1684
01:19:38,030 --> 01:19:41,390
I don't know if that's a real thing.
The thing is they always say is that the

1685
01:19:41,391 --> 01:19:44,720
CIA would talk to the people in
Hollywood and tell them what to say in

1686
01:19:44,721 --> 01:19:48,290
terms of propaganda and maybe.
I don't know.

1687
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:49,910
I don't have any personal knowledge of
it.

1688
01:19:49,911 --> 01:19:54,120
I'm sure someone has decided that if
they're going to make a movie about like

1689
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:57,140
zero dark 30,
that they have to get some sort of

1690
01:19:57,141 --> 01:20:01,830
approval and I'm sure that a lot of
movies that are very inspirational that

1691
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,980
have to do with the military would be
great for recruitment.

1692
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:08,010
So I'm sure there's some involvement.
I'm sure there's also some patriots that

1693
01:20:08,011 --> 01:20:13,011
work in show business that want to put
out these movies about the government

1694
01:20:14,431 --> 01:20:16,620
and about the military in a very
positive way.

1695
01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:19,260
That's probably the case in some
instances too,

1696
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:23,670
but not everything's a fucking
conspiracy and this is why it's stupid.

1697
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:26,400
It's stupid is some things are fucking
conspiracy.

1698
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:30,570
And Alex Jones has talked about some
things that were real conspiracies,

1699
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:35,250
that nine slash 11 documentary,
the road to tyranny details the world

1700
01:20:35,251 --> 01:20:40,251
trade organization protests where they
sent in these agent provocateur tours

1701
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:42,900
that which are essentially soldiers.

1702
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:47,520
They send in soldiers and military
people dressed up in all black and cover

1703
01:20:47,521 --> 01:20:51,180
their face and they smashed windows and
tip over things and they take a peaceful

1704
01:20:51,181 --> 01:20:54,780
protest and they turn it violent.
So then the police can move in and shut

1705
01:20:54,781 --> 01:20:57,390
down the protest.
And then not only did they do that,

1706
01:20:57,450 --> 01:21:00,660
but they made a no protest zone.
And the United States of America,

1707
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:02,250
uh,
no protest zone.

1708
01:21:02,430 --> 01:21:04,290
Was it the United States of America?
Wasn't Vancouver,

1709
01:21:04,291 --> 01:21:05,760
was.
It was Seattle,

1710
01:21:05,761 --> 01:21:07,410
I think Seattle coover.
No,

1711
01:21:07,411 --> 01:21:11,490
I think at Seattle World Trade
Organization protests template with the

1712
01:21:11,491 --> 01:21:16,491
boots and they all have that shit,
but Alex detailed this in detail and it

1713
01:21:18,061 --> 01:21:22,830
was real when he makes things up.
Like there was one recently,

1714
01:21:22,831 --> 01:21:27,660
the David Pakman show had on about Alex
talking about people eating babies

1715
01:21:27,661 --> 01:21:31,380
pituitary glands and scattered vandalism
of downtown Seattle.

1716
01:21:31,381 --> 01:21:32,214
Yeah,
seattle.

1717
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:37,200
So the enforce a no protest zone.
That was in 2009 in 1999 rather.

1718
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:42,270
Was It [inaudible] 99.
December first 1999.

1719
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:46,050
The October 27.
Two thousand nine was the article.

1720
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:48,150
Yeah,
Alex did that.

1721
01:21:48,151 --> 01:21:51,060
That was real.
That was legit and it was very

1722
01:21:51,061 --> 01:21:54,040
informative because I didn't know that
that is how the government operates

1723
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:56,420
sometimes.
Did you contact him the second time and

1724
01:21:56,421 --> 01:21:57,580
go,
what the fuck are often.

1725
01:21:57,900 --> 01:22:00,180
I send them a text message,
so this is why I won't talk to you.

1726
01:22:00,181 --> 01:22:05,181
You say crazy stupid shit like this,
but I don't hate the guy.

1727
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:06,090
He's,
you know,

1728
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:08,220
he'll scream and yell and call me a
demon.

1729
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:11,160
He's not a good place.
You're not in a good place when you're

1730
01:22:11,161 --> 01:22:14,010
defending against that.
And what all these other conspiracies,

1731
01:22:14,011 --> 01:22:17,790
like it's all fun and games until you're
talking about people's kids getting

1732
01:22:17,791 --> 01:22:19,560
murdered and then all of a sudden people
are like,

1733
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:22,290
fuck you.
And that's basically what happen with

1734
01:22:22,291 --> 01:22:22,470
him.

1735
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:27,390
If he was just ranting about government
conspiracies or you know,

1736
01:22:27,391 --> 01:22:30,690
who shot this guy or who's stealing
money from here.

1737
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:33,660
Some of what he talks about is
beneficial.

1738
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:36,780
But Alex is not.
I don't think he's in a good place.

1739
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:38,370
I don't think he's in a good place
mentally.

1740
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,380
And I don't.
I don't think he's in a good place in

1741
01:22:40,381 --> 01:22:43,860
terms of his situation with the law.
Don't hate you.

1742
01:22:43,861 --> 01:22:45,540
Alex Jones.
If you listen to this,

1743
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,520
if I saw you,
I'd still give you a hug.

1744
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,980
I'll still even do your fucking show
when I come to Austin.

1745
01:22:49,981 --> 01:22:50,990
I don't care.
You can,

1746
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:53,970
we can come and hang out,
but just stop making shit up.

1747
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,110
It's silly.
And you know,

1748
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:01,140
I'm sorry if there's bad stuff between
us.

1749
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:03,900
A more.
Sorry of what you said about those kids.

1750
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:05,910
I'm sorry about everything.
It's,

1751
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:09,310
it's unfortunate.
It's all terrible now.

1752
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:13,990
Something like that.
What's the road to redemption for

1753
01:23:13,991 --> 01:23:16,660
someone like that because some.
This is the thing about people is,

1754
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:18,820
and I think this is also what's going on
with Alex.

1755
01:23:18,970 --> 01:23:23,970
people need a road to redemption.
Like if if someone fucks up horribly and

1756
01:23:25,841 --> 01:23:29,950
does something terrible,
should that be the end of them?

1757
01:23:30,850 --> 01:23:32,860
This idea that we don't need them
anymore,

1758
01:23:32,950 --> 01:23:34,000
no matter who it is.

1759
01:23:36,050 --> 01:23:39,340
I mean what?
What does a person have to do to grow

1760
01:23:39,341 --> 01:23:44,170
and learn and for people just accept
them again and lead them on to all

1761
01:23:44,171 --> 01:23:45,190
platforms again.
What,

1762
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:47,110
what?
What does a person have to do?

1763
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:49,700
It's a real good question.
I think it's

1764
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:52,500
per person though.
Like somebody like Alex just seems like

1765
01:23:52,501 --> 01:23:55,650
he's getting worse and worse.
Like this seems like what he did teach

1766
01:23:55,651 --> 01:23:58,470
us.
You mad at me because I haven't had them

1767
01:23:58,471 --> 01:23:59,920
on that.
He,

1768
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:03,060
I'm sure to you he asked you or if he
was in town?

1769
01:24:03,690 --> 01:24:04,523
No,
no.

1770
01:24:04,550 --> 01:24:07,040
Do you not listening?
I said I didn't want to have them on

1771
01:24:07,050 --> 01:24:08,690
one.
I was trying to figure out whether I

1772
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:10,910
would have him on,
but when I watched the media matters

1773
01:24:10,911 --> 01:24:13,670
video,
it was very clear to me he wasn't being

1774
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:16,160
on.
I asked him if he had said that it was

1775
01:24:16,161 --> 01:24:20,090
fake and he said he questioned whether
or not it was real,

1776
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,790
but then eventually he acknowledged that
it was real,

1777
01:24:22,791 --> 01:24:25,970
which he has done,
but there was many times where he said

1778
01:24:25,971 --> 01:24:27,200
it was fake.
Not One,

1779
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:29,060
many times.
It's absolutely fake.

1780
01:24:29,061 --> 01:24:31,340
It was 100 percent fake.
There's video of it.

1781
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:34,610
I didn't see the video before.
We did our nine slash 11 podcast.

1782
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:38,470
I've seen it now and I still thought
about having them on.

1783
01:24:38,471 --> 01:24:41,900
I still thought about talking to them
about it and talking to them about all

1784
01:24:41,901 --> 01:24:43,100
this shit and what it's like.

1785
01:24:44,970 --> 01:24:47,010
I think it's.
He plays a character.

1786
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:48,450
Honestly.
I don't think so.

1787
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:51,780
I mean with the reptiles guys and people
and the things that he says,

1788
01:24:51,810 --> 01:24:53,130
none of it.
Half of it's just like,

1789
01:24:53,131 --> 01:24:54,390
what the fuck are you talking about?

1790
01:24:54,530 --> 01:24:56,690
I think he.
He definitely goes,

1791
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:59,270
goes crazy with some things,
but I don't think he's doing well,

1792
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:04,860
but he was talking about eating babies.
Pituitary glands were found fondant.

1793
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,680
David Pakman video.
David Pakman,

1794
01:25:06,681 --> 01:25:10,550
who's a progressive,
a commentator online.

1795
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:12,680
He,
he was going,

1796
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:14,060
look,
something's wrong with him.

1797
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:17,770
Like he's playing this video,
like what he's talking about them

1798
01:25:17,771 --> 01:25:18,604
breaking into

1799
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,220
what is happening in the Alex Jones.
Yeah.

1800
01:25:20,221 --> 01:25:23,310
See if you can find the part on the
video where Alex is talking.

1801
01:25:23,311 --> 01:25:25,170
It's early on.
It sounds like schizophrenia.

1802
01:25:25,230 --> 01:25:29,640
It sounds like any episode of live pd or
cops and people are talking like,

1803
01:25:29,670 --> 01:25:32,760
I saw aliens upstairs in my house,
you know,

1804
01:25:32,990 --> 01:25:34,980
like the other guy,
Owen Benjamin,

1805
01:25:34,981 --> 01:25:35,671
look at him,
see,

1806
01:25:35,671 --> 01:25:36,900
play this place real quick.

1807
01:25:37,710 --> 01:25:40,370
It's all in plain view of these people.
They're just putting it in our face.

1808
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:44,640
They want a system where we can't do
anything to stop them.

1809
01:25:45,570 --> 01:25:48,540
That's like Bill Maher,
the name of his production company as a

1810
01:25:48,930 --> 01:25:49,763
kid.
Love,

1811
01:25:50,290 --> 01:25:52,980
which is enabled slogan.
Basically.

1812
01:25:53,370 --> 01:25:57,720
They make jokes about having sex with
kids all the time and she says it's okay

1813
01:25:57,721 --> 01:25:58,720
to have sex with.
You know,

1814
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:01,580
kids don't have section 35 year olds
when they're 12,

1815
01:26:01,950 --> 01:26:06,420
just incredibly evil,
pathetic stuff of these solas demons

1816
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:12,320
like Bill Maher.
But Josh was saying he had a theory,

1817
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:18,880
the only one walnut saw says USA.
It's the pituitary gland because they

1818
01:26:19,311 --> 01:26:24,311
confirm that Jimmy Chevelle and others
would a torsional kids to death,

1819
01:26:24,321 --> 01:26:25,940
but they couldn't get regular ones to
kill.

1820
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:29,120
Her favorite thing was to grab a kid,
run over with the car so they could say,

1821
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:30,020
oh,
there's a police report.

1822
01:26:30,021 --> 01:26:33,080
They are run our.
But they would hurry to the morgue and

1823
01:26:33,190 --> 01:26:35,530
they work with different,
different government controlled morgues

1824
01:26:35,540 --> 01:26:37,940
and eat the pituitary gland as quickly
as possible,

1825
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:39,070
uh,
and,

1826
01:26:39,070 --> 01:26:40,190
and,
and get high off of it.

1827
01:26:40,191 --> 01:26:41,024
So yes.

1828
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:46,160
Yeah.
That's this.

1829
01:26:46,830 --> 01:26:48,690
First of all,
Bill Maher's done a fucking pedophile.

1830
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,150
This,
this is crazy.

1831
01:26:51,151 --> 01:26:56,151
This is like a weird rambling and this
is not alex that I knew from 1998.

1832
01:26:56,730 --> 01:26:58,440
So it's not,
it's not the same guy.

1833
01:26:59,430 --> 01:27:04,080
This is a guy who's not doing well.
So my apology,

1834
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,960
um,
as a human being to Alex Jones,

1835
01:27:06,990 --> 01:27:08,850
if uh,
you were hurt that I didn't have you

1836
01:27:08,851 --> 01:27:12,390
back on the show if you were hurt that I
occasionally poke fun at you.

1837
01:27:12,391 --> 01:27:15,330
I have to.
You're hilarious unfortunately.

1838
01:27:15,540 --> 01:27:16,380
But,
uh,

1839
01:27:16,930 --> 01:27:19,770
I don't hate you.
Don't wish you wish you badly.

1840
01:27:19,771 --> 01:27:22,440
And uh,
back in the day I enjoyed a lot of your

1841
01:27:22,441 --> 01:27:24,870
stuff.
People lose their way,

1842
01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:27,570
you know,
so

1843
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:30,270
I think that,
um,

1844
01:27:32,310 --> 01:27:36,720
it's a real bad feeling being stuck on
the outside too when they all band

1845
01:27:36,721 --> 01:27:40,260
together and kick you out and everybody
kicks you out.

1846
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:43,860
Everybody,
twitter and facebook and everybody and

1847
01:27:43,890 --> 01:27:45,720
Youtube and twitter was the last one.

1848
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:48,780
But uh,
that was Jack Dorsey didn't even know

1849
01:27:48,781 --> 01:27:51,960
why Alex Jones got kicked off twitter
and people like,

1850
01:27:51,961 --> 01:27:52,830
well,
let them back in.

1851
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:53,700
Then like,
yeah,

1852
01:27:53,701 --> 01:27:56,190
but somebody knows somebody.
Like,

1853
01:27:56,220 --> 01:28:00,930
I don't think Jack Dorsey is really the
guy who's looking at each individual

1854
01:28:00,931 --> 01:28:04,110
person that gets banned.
I just have a feeling that that stuff is

1855
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:06,030
compartmentalized.
Right?

1856
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:10,440
I told you 100 percent,
7 million monthly active users.

1857
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:13,230
Right?
But how many people are.

1858
01:28:13,231 --> 01:28:17,650
I'm responsible for banning people and
real high profile people though.

1859
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:20,640
I'm sure there's a whole,
like maybe 12 people.

1860
01:28:20,641 --> 01:28:22,040
They have to have a meeting.
Then they,

1861
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:23,670
you know,
maybe they talked to Jack,

1862
01:28:23,671 --> 01:28:24,720
maybe they don't.
Maybe they,

1863
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:27,180
they position who.
Yeah,

1864
01:28:27,181 --> 01:28:27,721
right.
He,

1865
01:28:27,721 --> 01:28:29,160
maybe he doesn't.
We don't know.

1866
01:28:29,190 --> 01:28:31,920
I'll ask that for sure.
But maybe he didn't know when people got

1867
01:28:31,921 --> 01:28:34,080
banned until he liked maybe got
accompany memo.

1868
01:28:34,230 --> 01:28:36,210
Maybe he wasn't involved in the course.

1869
01:28:36,210 --> 01:28:37,350
Maybe.
I don't know.

1870
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:40,020
Maybe he's the one that called them up
and said,

1871
01:28:40,021 --> 01:28:42,120
get rid of this motherfucker that's
possible too.

1872
01:28:42,570 --> 01:28:43,470
Like,
here's another one,

1873
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:45,540
right?
Here's one that people had an issue

1874
01:28:45,541 --> 01:28:48,720
with.
And one thing you could say,

1875
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:50,490
okay.
I'm like,

1876
01:28:50,491 --> 01:28:51,810
uh,
when Kathy Griffin held up the,

1877
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,310
the,
the trump head,

1878
01:28:53,610 --> 01:28:55,230
remember that?
Um,

1879
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:56,850
did she do that on her own twitter
account?

1880
01:28:57,190 --> 01:28:58,260
Uh,
yeah,

1881
01:28:58,560 --> 01:28:59,470
she,
yeah,

1882
01:28:59,780 --> 01:29:00,600
she,
well,

1883
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:01,910
she,
a photo of it.

1884
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,290
When she posted,
she posted on instagram or twitter.

1885
01:29:04,350 --> 01:29:06,690
I think it was on both.
I'm not 100 percent sure.

1886
01:29:07,070 --> 01:29:10,640
Right.
So that it's A.

1887
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,220
is it allowed?
It's allowed because it's newsworthy

1888
01:29:14,221 --> 01:29:19,221
because it's a celebrity and the
celebrity is threatening a public figure

1889
01:29:20,341 --> 01:29:22,800
who is also the most powerful person in
the world.

1890
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:23,723
So it's.
Okay.

1891
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:25,020
Did that,
why that is.

1892
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:29,040
I think she posted it because it was an
art piece that was kind of

1893
01:29:29,041 --> 01:29:29,880
controversial.

1894
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:30,450
Oh No,
no.

1895
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:32,100
I know that.
And that's what I'm saying.

1896
01:29:32,150 --> 01:29:36,240
Why are saying why is it okay?
Why is she still allowed to be on the

1897
01:29:36,241 --> 01:29:38,490
platform?
And Alex Jones case kicked off.

1898
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:40,170
That's a,
it's an interesting question,

1899
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:40,741
right?
Like,

1900
01:29:40,741 --> 01:29:42,690
what do you need to do to get kicked
off?

1901
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:44,520
Because that's not the only thing that
Kathy's done.

1902
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:47,070
Um,
recently she was one of the people that

1903
01:29:47,071 --> 01:29:50,280
was calling for the name for that young
boy who was,

1904
01:29:50,290 --> 01:29:52,860
um,
with that native American in front of

1905
01:29:52,861 --> 01:29:54,900
his face beating the drum.
She's crazy,

1906
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:55,980
irresponsible,
you know,

1907
01:29:56,010 --> 01:29:58,230
I'm sure she feels bad about it now in
retrospect,

1908
01:29:58,231 --> 01:30:00,990
especially if she's watched the video,
but you got carried away and she

1909
01:30:00,991 --> 01:30:02,220
thought,
what we all thought when you saw the

1910
01:30:02,221 --> 01:30:04,980
picture that smirking can't have a kid
that got in the face,

1911
01:30:04,981 --> 01:30:07,170
this beautiful indigenous man is singing
his,

1912
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:09,900
his rain dance cry or whatever the fuck
he's doing.

1913
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:11,730
Yeah.
That's not what it was though.

1914
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:15,360
We found out afterwards it was much more
complicated.

1915
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:17,270
What is their song?
What were they saying?

1916
01:30:18,070 --> 01:30:19,830
Sounded cool.
They should make a record.

1917
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:22,410
Yeah.
Do you like that shit?

1918
01:30:22,470 --> 01:30:23,970
That shit's cool to listen to.
When you work out,

1919
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:28,620
if you could get like some,
some legit native American chance like

1920
01:30:28,621 --> 01:30:30,720
that puts you into a trance.
Right?

1921
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:33,960
If you don't know what they're saying
and you just go running and you listen

1922
01:30:33,961 --> 01:30:36,840
to that.
Took a little couple tokes.

1923
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:39,330
Go for.
Go for a jog in the woods,

1924
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,560
listening to native American chance on
your air ponds.

1925
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:46,290
That was an interesting video though
because I mean I was a one 80 after just

1926
01:30:46,291 --> 01:30:50,520
hearing the second side of the story,
like 12 hours later people still were

1927
01:30:50,521 --> 01:30:52,350
calling for that guy's head.
Yeah.

1928
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:54,840
And people.
I saw someone who said,

1929
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:56,370
um,
what's his name?

1930
01:30:56,370 --> 01:30:57,810
Ron Perlman?
No,

1931
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:02,130
who's the guy who was a hellboy?
Ron Ron Perlman was like,

1932
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:05,580
motherfuckers telling me that I'm not
seeing what I'm seeing.

1933
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:10,110
And she said something about some white
prick or white motherfucker.

1934
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:11,011
I'm like,
oh,

1935
01:31:11,011 --> 01:31:13,500
okay.
People try so hard.

1936
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:15,870
Like you,
you are seeing what you're seeing.

1937
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:17,240
You're seeing what you're saying.
Well,

1938
01:31:17,290 --> 01:31:21,060
you're not seeing is a video that shows
how it occurred.

1939
01:31:21,450 --> 01:31:23,280
That's all it is,
you know?

1940
01:31:23,610 --> 01:31:25,380
So why is that?
Okay?

1941
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:26,640
Right.
Why is that okay?

1942
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Why is it okay for some journalists to
say horrible things about white people?

1943
01:31:32,910 --> 01:31:34,860
Why is that okay?
Why is that okay?

1944
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:39,090
It seems weird.
What if it encourages violence against a

1945
01:31:39,150 --> 01:31:42,570
innocent white person?
Just one should be responsible.

1946
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:44,100
What if they say,
why did you do that?

1947
01:31:44,101 --> 01:31:45,090
Well,
I read Blah,

1948
01:31:45,091 --> 01:31:46,890
blah,
blah as a tweet.

1949
01:31:47,070 --> 01:31:47,851
And I was like,
you know what,

1950
01:31:47,851 --> 01:31:49,740
I am going to go out and punch a white
person.

1951
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:52,680
Fuck that.
I just found some white old lady and I

1952
01:31:52,710 --> 01:31:56,010
beat her ass.
Like if someone decides that you're not

1953
01:31:56,011 --> 01:31:58,290
responsible for that or yeah,
probably not.

1954
01:31:58,710 --> 01:32:00,130
But you kind of feel

1955
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:03,490
like you played a part in the way people
look at things,

1956
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:06,640
especially people that are very easily
influenced,

1957
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:08,680
you know?
It's just also,

1958
01:32:08,681 --> 01:32:11,350
it's gross.
He reads something really racist against

1959
01:32:11,351 --> 01:32:11,981
white people.
You're like,

1960
01:32:11,981 --> 01:32:14,090
that's gross.
Like you think all,

1961
01:32:14,091 --> 01:32:16,720
all people are like that.
A whole group of people that don't have

1962
01:32:16,721 --> 01:32:18,130
as much melanin.
They're all shit.

1963
01:32:18,490 --> 01:32:21,370
That's ridiculous.
You're ridiculous person.

1964
01:32:21,371 --> 01:32:23,620
I don't care if you're brown or black or
yellow,

1965
01:32:23,650 --> 01:32:27,400
you're ridiculous.
That's silly because we have to decide.

1966
01:32:28,870 --> 01:32:31,850
It's got to decide like what the fuck
we're doing.

1967
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:37,160
If we keep letting illogical behavior be
normal,

1968
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:42,050
like breaking us off into fucking groups
like that and thinking that you know,

1969
01:32:42,230 --> 01:32:46,280
all men are great or all women are great
or all gays are great and never all

1970
01:32:46,281 --> 01:32:48,500
straight cisgendered men can go fuck
themselves.

1971
01:32:48,501 --> 01:32:49,960
All right,
that's,

1972
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:52,880
that's silly talk.
I don't care who you are,

1973
01:32:53,210 --> 01:32:55,520
you're not allowed to do that,
but we let people do that.

1974
01:32:55,521 --> 01:32:57,320
If they're a part of a marginalized
class,

1975
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,150
if someone's a part of a marginalized
class,

1976
01:32:59,180 --> 01:33:03,080
then you get to shit on everybody.
In a weird way.

1977
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:05,480
You get to like reinforce racism.
It's really.

1978
01:33:05,690 --> 01:33:09,080
It's so fucking counterproductive too
because if you do that then it just

1979
01:33:09,081 --> 01:33:11,230
makes people just get defensive on the
other side.

1980
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:14,270
They don't even want to even think or
empathize with how you are.

1981
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:21,720
What social media has really made.
Everything annoying has made me think

1982
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:25,280
great too though.
Both do twitter is like we're saying

1983
01:33:25,390 --> 01:33:27,940
when someone says something dumb like
trump will say something dumb sometimes

1984
01:33:27,941 --> 01:33:32,080
and I'll just go there for the memes and
I'll just read his post and it'll get me

1985
01:33:32,081 --> 01:33:34,740
going in the morning.
I'll get like 15 minutes of [inaudible].

1986
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:38,320
Probably missed the story yesterday.
Have you heard any of the 21 savage

1987
01:33:38,321 --> 01:33:39,071
news?
Oh,

1988
01:33:39,071 --> 01:33:40,010
you got deported,
right?

1989
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:44,140
Because everyone found out yesterday
that he's apparently from the UK and so

1990
01:33:44,141 --> 01:33:47,530
like the story.
There's two stories that as part of the

1991
01:33:47,531 --> 01:33:51,520
story,
but memes of him being from the UK and

1992
01:33:51,521 --> 01:33:55,330
the British rapper that's rosie from
Atlanta really took over to the fact

1993
01:33:55,331 --> 01:33:58,690
like Demi Lovato tweeted it and she got
shit on and she's deleted her twitter

1994
01:33:58,691 --> 01:34:02,320
now because of the response to that.
Did you know who this guy was before?

1995
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:04,930
No,
but I'm 51 years old.

1996
01:34:04,970 --> 01:34:05,711
Yes,
man.

1997
01:34:05,711 --> 01:34:06,880
Number one,
like Oh shit.

1998
01:34:06,881 --> 01:34:07,661
Number one,
write record.

1999
01:34:07,661 --> 01:34:09,230
And now like in the country.
Really?

2000
01:34:09,370 --> 01:34:12,520
But Jamie's on black twitter,
twitter.

2001
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:13,790
But you're on black twitter.
Sure,

2002
01:34:13,810 --> 01:34:16,130
sure I'd be.
I.

2003
01:34:17,050 --> 01:34:18,240
Oh yeah.
My father.

2004
01:34:18,241 --> 01:34:20,230
A lot of them.
I don't know any of these.

2005
01:34:20,390 --> 01:34:24,010
Tech Nines and Sushi for fucked that.
Takeshi.

2006
01:34:24,011 --> 01:34:25,780
Six nine.
He's fucked.

2007
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:27,400
Maybe.
What do you mean?

2008
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:30,820
Maybe he's talking.
He's still fucked.

2009
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,580
He's.
He's fun.

2010
01:34:32,740 --> 01:34:35,680
He's going to jail for a long time with
a tattoo of six,

2011
01:34:35,681 --> 01:34:37,990
nine on his face.
He's going to jail.

2012
01:34:38,270 --> 01:34:40,600
Who's going to have real problems?
That ain't good.

2013
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:44,680
You read the list of charges.
There's murder involved.

2014
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:48,940
Murder conspiracy of him supposedly
calling a hit on someone.

2015
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,540
Oh Jesus Christ.
Oh my God.

2016
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:53,703
Oh,
he's fucked.

2017
01:34:54,550 --> 01:34:57,260
Even if he cooperates,
if they put a hit on someone because he

2018
01:34:57,261 --> 01:34:58,040
said it,

2019
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:01,490
Jesus he'll hear,
won't get like the death penalty,

2020
01:35:01,491 --> 01:35:05,240
but now he'll be like life in prison or
you know someone's fleshlight.

2021
01:35:05,270 --> 01:35:06,630
Yeah.
Heck yeah.

2022
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:10,420
It's a real problem.
Soldier boys in jail too is.

2023
01:35:10,421 --> 01:35:12,980
I mean it is.
For what got arrested.

2024
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:16,670
Did he beat up his girl and his girl
beat him up?

2025
01:35:16,790 --> 01:35:17,060
No,
no,

2026
01:35:17,060 --> 01:35:19,220
that was a little bit while he's son of
a bitch.

2027
01:35:19,221 --> 01:35:21,590
You just shamed soulja boy for no
reason.

2028
01:35:21,890 --> 01:35:24,170
With your shitty pot.
Adult memory,

2029
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:27,170
right?
I know.

2030
01:35:27,171 --> 01:35:28,004
It was a little bow.
Wow.

2031
01:35:28,010 --> 01:35:28,880
No,
there was something else.

2032
01:35:28,910 --> 01:35:29,743
Hold on.
Yep.

2033
01:35:30,210 --> 01:35:33,000
Is Accused of kidnapping a woman happy.
I'm sorry.

2034
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:35,860
So you got the stories conflated.
Kidnapping.

2035
01:35:35,870 --> 01:35:38,480
Because even worse,
he tied a girl to a,

2036
01:35:38,481 --> 01:35:41,660
a,
a chair using an extension cord and kept

2037
01:35:41,661 --> 01:35:44,570
her for six or seven hours in his
garage.

2038
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,220
Oh yeah.
Oh,

2039
01:35:46,221 --> 01:35:47,840
he's going to jail forever.
Prom.

2040
01:35:47,870 --> 01:35:49,760
What did he do that.
But that's someone's daughter wouldn't

2041
01:35:49,761 --> 01:35:53,290
do that for a jealousy.
I think it said.

2042
01:35:53,940 --> 01:35:56,400
This is apparently according to
celebrity news outlet.

2043
01:35:56,401 --> 01:36:00,390
The woman whose name I will not say
apparently was backing out of a driveway

2044
01:36:00,391 --> 01:36:02,790
in her car,
hit soldiers la home when she hit the

2045
01:36:02,791 --> 01:36:06,030
curb or at his house when she hit the
curb.

2046
01:36:06,031 --> 01:36:08,520
From that point on,
his assistant reportedly became upset

2047
01:36:08,521 --> 01:36:10,650
and started fighting with her from
there.

2048
01:36:10,830 --> 01:36:13,530
Soldier allegedly stepped outside and
tried to break up the fight.

2049
01:36:13,980 --> 01:36:16,740
The woman says that he began punching
and kicking her when she was on the

2050
01:36:16,741 --> 01:36:19,230
ground and then tied her up for six
hours.

2051
01:36:21,810 --> 01:36:22,810
God,
Soulja boy.

2052
01:36:24,010 --> 01:36:27,310
Well,
at least Nintendo one wish that cooler

2053
01:36:27,311 --> 01:36:30,670
heads will prevail,
but that sounds like that sounds like a

2054
01:36:30,671 --> 01:36:34,000
fucking disaster.
Jesus Christ.

2055
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:37,660
You never hear about the spin doctors
causing any problems.

2056
01:36:37,661 --> 01:36:39,100
Right guys?
She hit a curb.

2057
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:40,190
This all started.
She heard it.

2058
01:36:40,330 --> 01:36:42,040
She hit a curb with his car or
something.

2059
01:36:42,041 --> 01:36:44,410
She's curb one of his wheels.
Wasn't enough information on there.

2060
01:36:44,411 --> 01:36:45,850
I don't know.
Yeah,

2061
01:36:45,940 --> 01:36:49,570
she probably curbed one of his wheels.
It was a nice car and she didn't know

2062
01:36:49,571 --> 01:36:51,250
what the fuck she was doing.
I can drive

2063
01:36:53,740 --> 01:36:58,480
what a Dick tied her up and beat her up,
allegedly,

2064
01:36:58,660 --> 01:36:59,680
allegedly.
Right,

2065
01:36:59,681 --> 01:37:00,430
right,
right.

2066
01:37:00,430 --> 01:37:02,710
You got to always say that.
Denied by this.

2067
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:05,920
Did you see that video,
that old man putting the ice on the

2068
01:37:05,921 --> 01:37:08,650
ground and then pretending he fell.
Oh,

2069
01:37:08,651 --> 01:37:09,260
that's.
Yeah.

2070
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:10,900
Allegedly brilliant.
Allegedly,

2071
01:37:10,910 --> 01:37:11,890
allegedly.
Allegedly.

2072
01:37:11,891 --> 01:37:13,540
There's no allegedly lead for that.

2073
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:15,850
It's amazing.
It's amazing to watch because he didn't

2074
01:37:15,851 --> 01:37:19,030
know there was a security camera there.
Tried to collect.

2075
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:21,100
Yeah.
There's a lot of people that do that,

2076
01:37:21,101 --> 01:37:22,390
man.
I've seen videos of people doing that at

2077
01:37:22,391 --> 01:37:24,370
the mall.
They'll like throw a drink down and then

2078
01:37:24,371 --> 01:37:27,190
slide down on the drink.
We had a guy do it once at a movie

2079
01:37:27,191 --> 01:37:30,580
theater I worked at and we had it on
video also and we just showed them the

2080
01:37:30,581 --> 01:37:32,830
video and then he left and never heard
anything about it,

2081
01:37:32,831 --> 01:37:35,280
but he was bitching up a storm like he
was hurt was me.

2082
01:37:35,281 --> 01:37:37,180
This guy,
this guy's hilarious.

2083
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:40,000
So he's walking.
He looks around chuck some ice on the

2084
01:37:40,001 --> 01:37:41,860
ground.
A little bit of a nightstand.

2085
01:37:41,861 --> 01:37:44,380
No big deal.
I'm gonna go over here and la Di da Di

2086
01:37:44,381 --> 01:37:46,250
da.
I left this fall.

2087
01:37:46,510 --> 01:37:48,100
Watch this.
He looks around and make sure no one's

2088
01:37:48,101 --> 01:37:49,250
looking.
Oh.

2089
01:37:50,170 --> 01:37:53,920
Even felt like a bitch.
It's like holding is the most ridiculous

2090
01:37:54,730 --> 01:37:56,160
look.
That silly,

2091
01:37:56,970 --> 01:37:58,440
silly,
silly man.

2092
01:38:00,030 --> 01:38:03,300
The thing about those guys is like
anybody that does that kind of shit,

2093
01:38:03,690 --> 01:38:05,250
I think the cops,
all they have to do is go,

2094
01:38:05,251 --> 01:38:09,210
sure what's your social security number?
And they look up all the shit that he's

2095
01:38:09,211 --> 01:38:11,820
also done.
Like you don't that even just a little

2096
01:38:11,821 --> 01:38:12,654
bit of a scam.

2097
01:38:13,430 --> 01:38:17,720
That's a guy who's been scam and it's
like in Russia and stuff or other

2098
01:38:17,721 --> 01:38:20,150
countries where everyone's doing the
insurance scams.

2099
01:38:20,151 --> 01:38:23,240
And so to the point where everybody has
to have dash cams on their car.

2100
01:38:23,241 --> 01:38:27,170
Now there's a lot of that just triggered
a story I heard over the weekend.

2101
01:38:27,171 --> 01:38:28,390
There was a not,
it's,

2102
01:38:28,580 --> 01:38:33,020
I think this is a story happening in
Houston where the cops broke into a

2103
01:38:33,021 --> 01:38:35,720
house where they had heard that there
was or they think they had a warrant.

2104
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:40,640
A report was that neighbors had called
and black tar heroin sales or something

2105
01:38:40,641 --> 01:38:44,690
like that at this house.
So they broke in without knocking.

2106
01:38:44,691 --> 01:38:46,820
It was like a no knock warrant.
Uh,

2107
01:38:46,850 --> 01:38:49,730
the guys like 57 in the house,
here's someone break into his house,

2108
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:53,840
gets a shotgun,
shoots one of the cops that killed him.

2109
01:38:54,290 --> 01:38:55,940
His wife is like,
what the fuck's going on?

2110
01:38:55,970 --> 01:38:59,150
She goes to try to grab the other cops
gun that had just fallen.

2111
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:02,960
She gets shot,
two people are dead and they didn't find

2112
01:39:02,961 --> 01:39:04,980
any heroine.
Oh Geez.

2113
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:06,980
There's like some weed in there or
something like that.

2114
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:11,480
And some people are like,
they didn't have a history of doing much

2115
01:39:11,570 --> 01:39:13,620
from what I read.
That's why I thought of it because they

2116
01:39:13,621 --> 01:39:15,560
look back with these guys.
Do they have an arrest history or

2117
01:39:15,561 --> 01:39:16,970
anything?
And it wasn't anything that they had

2118
01:39:16,971 --> 01:39:18,440
found,
at least what I read about it.

2119
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:22,940
Do you remember the one where there was
a mayor outside of Washington DC and he,

2120
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:26,810
uh,
they were using his house as an address

2121
01:39:27,470 --> 01:39:31,520
and it was something with the mail
delivery guy was running weed.

2122
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:36,400
And so the mail delivery guy would come
by and uh,

2123
01:39:36,770 --> 01:39:40,040
the package was addressed to him,
but he would just keep the package

2124
01:39:40,041 --> 01:39:42,560
because he knew that this was this guy's
house.

2125
01:39:42,561 --> 01:39:44,840
It was on his route and that way,
you know,

2126
01:39:44,841 --> 01:39:47,360
as the package came into mail would be
his to deliver,

2127
01:39:47,450 --> 01:39:49,190
but instead of delivering it he would
hold onto it.

2128
01:39:49,670 --> 01:39:52,130
So they break into the mayor's house?
No.

2129
01:39:52,131 --> 01:39:56,960
You know the whole shoot his fucking
dogs shoon his dog and he had like one

2130
01:39:56,961 --> 01:40:00,770
of my dog like Marshall.
So like a super duper sweet dog,

2131
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,930
either yellow lab,
which is real similar.

2132
01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:05,750
I think it was a yellow,
might've been golden retriever.

2133
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:08,750
Either way they fucking shot at least
one of his dogs.

2134
01:40:08,751 --> 01:40:11,180
How did they not know that was the
mayor's house you think that would be

2135
01:40:11,530 --> 01:40:16,530
like on a list day,
didn't Google shit or maybe they did.

2136
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:19,550
Maybe they thought fucking the mayors.
A drug dealer.

2137
01:40:19,820 --> 01:40:23,450
Maybe they really thought that,
but that kind of shit is dark man.

2138
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:26,540
We just go shoot a golden retriever.
Come on,

2139
01:40:26,541 --> 01:40:29,270
you're not a pussy and I know you're
going in there because you think that

2140
01:40:29,271 --> 01:40:31,850
this is a real drug running operation
because the cops just got bad

2141
01:40:31,851 --> 01:40:32,684
information.
Right?

2142
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:34,820
But you're not a pussy.
You don't have to shoot a fucking

2143
01:40:34,821 --> 01:40:37,250
labrador stop.
You think that things going to bite you

2144
01:40:37,310 --> 01:40:40,970
will when it does shoot it then.
So I'm going to play you the fuck out of

2145
01:40:40,971 --> 01:40:42,380
here.
That's a weird power trip.

2146
01:40:42,381 --> 01:40:44,630
Shit thing.
Shoot all dogs know if.

2147
01:40:44,810 --> 01:40:46,370
Look,
if a guy's got a wolf and it's off the

2148
01:40:46,371 --> 01:40:47,360
chain,
it's running out you.

2149
01:40:47,361 --> 01:40:48,194
Yeah,
shoot it.

2150
01:40:48,340 --> 01:40:50,870
You break in into some guy's house and
then you shoot his fucking dog.

2151
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:51,740
What if you're wrong?
Look,

2152
01:40:51,741 --> 01:40:53,980
you are a lot.
You cool with

2153
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,290
shoot and someone's fucking dog in front
of their kids.

2154
01:40:56,470 --> 01:40:58,810
That's what happened to the mayor of
this town.

2155
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:03,840
The fucking mayor.
I bet the guy was a mail carrier.

2156
01:41:04,661 --> 01:41:06,700
Just thought it was cute to use the
mayor's address.

2157
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:08,860
Get all the weed delivered.
Maybe you didn't.

2158
01:41:08,861 --> 01:41:13,330
Maybe voted for his opponent.
He thought it was safer to do it that

2159
01:41:13,331 --> 01:41:14,910
way.
Oh,

2160
01:41:15,550 --> 01:41:17,590
did you get a tesla?
Are you just driving around?

2161
01:41:17,750 --> 01:41:19,100
Oh,
God was telling me how.

2162
01:41:19,140 --> 01:41:21,940
How do you like it?
I had to get one.

2163
01:41:21,941 --> 01:41:22,830
I told them,
you live in Moscow.

2164
01:41:22,831 --> 01:41:25,700
I would get one guy did my podcast.
I almost solid.

2165
01:41:26,510 --> 01:41:28,140
I'm a man of my word.
Uh,

2166
01:41:28,141 --> 01:41:32,440
it's a fucking spaceship.
It's the weirdest thing I've ever driven

2167
01:41:32,441 --> 01:41:34,210
in my life.
It doesn't even make sense.

2168
01:41:34,211 --> 01:41:36,190
It's not even.
Not even.

2169
01:41:37,150 --> 01:41:40,150
There's not a single car that I've ever
driven that's even close to his fast.

2170
01:41:40,630 --> 01:41:43,360
Nothing like,
my porsche is so slow.

2171
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:47,930
I have a gt three Rs.
It has 518 horsepower.

2172
01:41:47,950 --> 01:41:50,560
Waste 3000 pounds.
It sounds like a dragon.

2173
01:41:51,100 --> 01:41:53,290
And that Tesla would leave it in the
dust.

2174
01:41:53,530 --> 01:41:57,910
I mean,
leave it in the dust like zero to 62

2175
01:41:57,911 --> 01:42:02,911
seconds quicker.
It's fucking insane and out of a no.

2176
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:04,110
Ludicrous.
Yeah,

2177
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:05,700
I did.
I put it in chill mode for a little

2178
01:42:05,750 --> 01:42:08,620
while,
but you could drive chill with ludicrous

2179
01:42:08,621 --> 01:42:09,610
mode.
Always available.

2180
01:42:09,611 --> 01:42:12,760
You don't have to keep switching back.
And little mode is just crazy,

2181
01:42:12,910 --> 01:42:15,310
like the fastest and it kills your
battery.

2182
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:16,780
Well,
it kills your battery quicker,

2183
01:42:16,781 --> 01:42:20,290
but the thrust that you get is a roller
coaster ride.

2184
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:21,640
It's insane.
I mean,

2185
01:42:21,641 --> 01:42:23,930
you can't believe how fast it is.
It doesn't even.

2186
01:42:23,931 --> 01:42:26,830
It literally doesn't make sense.
It doesn't seem right.

2187
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:31,600
It seems like like it's punching its way
through a wormhole use an alien

2188
01:42:31,601 --> 01:42:32,434
technology.

2189
01:42:32,530 --> 01:42:35,910
Meanwhile I posted,
it seems like something Bob was our

2190
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:38,590
snuck out of area 51.
I get all these messages from people.

2191
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:42,460
<Unk> has been debunked.
That's controlled opposition.

2192
01:42:44,100 --> 01:42:46,090
That's a fake story.
It's fake news bro.

2193
01:42:46,091 --> 01:42:49,420
They got you with the Bob Story.
Do you like all the tech in it?

2194
01:42:49,730 --> 01:42:52,480
That's the same one.
It's too much almost because it's this

2195
01:42:52,481 --> 01:42:55,090
giant screen.
Like I had a dim it where the fuck down

2196
01:42:55,091 --> 01:42:56,830
because I was looking at it like you're
so pretty,

2197
01:42:57,640 --> 01:42:59,720
so pretty.
It's so pretty.

2198
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:01,270
Dream car.
It's very comfortable.

2199
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:02,530
How long?
Super comfortable.

2200
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:06,550
Now do you have a supercharged station
at your house yet or do you thing on the

2201
01:43:06,551 --> 01:43:09,010
wall?
At my house that I can plug it into a

2202
01:43:09,011 --> 01:43:10,700
supercharger.
It takes like eight hours.

2203
01:43:10,701 --> 01:43:12,460
Eight hours or more.
And how many miles,

2204
01:43:12,461 --> 01:43:15,010
but I'm going to get one of those.
I'm going to get one of those fast

2205
01:43:15,011 --> 01:43:20,011
charger in the house because allegedly,
and I mean allegedly 311 miles.

2206
01:43:21,610 --> 01:43:23,170
Do you have the fuel?
But here's the problem.

2207
01:43:23,171 --> 01:43:25,930
I drive like a mall wrong,
so it's not going that far.

2208
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:29,130
Did you get,
is there a few option for that model and

2209
01:43:29,131 --> 01:43:32,050
like are you cool?
I think there's a fuel add on that gives

2210
01:43:32,051 --> 01:43:33,490
you an extra like,
oh,

2211
01:43:33,790 --> 01:43:36,240
that's an option.
Like I thought you meant a fuel

2212
01:43:36,340 --> 01:43:37,220
gasoline.
Yeah,

2213
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:40,650
I know.
What are you talking to?

2214
01:43:40,651 --> 01:43:43,210
Some models will not tesla.
Okay,

2215
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:44,440
good.
Just making shit up bro.

2216
01:43:44,740 --> 01:43:45,580
Some,
some.

2217
01:43:45,581 --> 01:43:46,710
Uh,
I think it was car.

2218
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:51,470
It is
extra for like one gallon of gas.

2219
01:43:51,530 --> 01:43:52,070
So like

2220
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:54,510
if you ever lose your battery.
I have heard of that.

2221
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:55,640
Yeah.
What was that?

2222
01:43:55,641 --> 01:43:57,160
I thought Tesla had that.
No,

2223
01:43:57,580 --> 01:43:57,941
no,
no,

2224
01:43:57,941 --> 01:44:00,940
no.
There was like a Prius.

2225
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:04,390
Prius is our mixed.
They're hybrids.

2226
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:08,590
Prius's use gasoline,
but a very stingy amount of gasoline.

2227
01:44:08,620 --> 01:44:11,440
They run partially on electric motors.
So Do,

2228
01:44:11,441 --> 01:44:13,060
uh,
the Acura NSX.

2229
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:18,280
The ACURA NSX has two electric motors,
but I think you don't ever charge it.

2230
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:23,320
I think the electric motors are powered
by the gasoline engine and electricity

2231
01:44:23,321 --> 01:44:24,400
in the car,
if I remember right.

2232
01:44:24,610 --> 01:44:29,140
That's supposed to be the motherfucker
like the Acura Nsx is supposed to be the

2233
01:44:29,141 --> 01:44:33,100
car that people are underlooked under
looking for whatever reason,

2234
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:35,290
it just doesn't get the love that it
deserves.

2235
01:44:35,291 --> 01:44:38,380
And apparently the 2019 models even more
insane.

2236
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:43,370
I can't wait to the day where like your
garage floor is like a wireless charging

2237
01:44:43,371 --> 01:44:45,890
mat.
You just pull right up into the mat or

2238
01:44:45,891 --> 01:44:47,660
they would never would be because it's
rubber.

2239
01:44:48,020 --> 01:44:50,340
Well there I'm sure they're fine because
like there's a,

2240
01:44:50,380 --> 01:44:51,340
there's,
there's like if you,

2241
01:44:51,470 --> 01:44:53,240
if you take your phone and put it on a
wireless charger,

2242
01:44:53,241 --> 01:44:55,940
there's like a little room that if you
don't have to touch it,

2243
01:44:55,990 --> 01:44:59,030
like maybe that's the whole reason why
you're safe from getting hit by

2244
01:44:59,031 --> 01:45:00,190
lightning bro.
Yeah,

2245
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:01,970
I like that.
The rubber protects you from

2246
01:45:01,971 --> 01:45:04,070
electricity.
Parco a little thing comes down to the

2247
01:45:04,071 --> 01:45:07,160
ground.
Like that thing falls out while you're

2248
01:45:07,161 --> 01:45:09,970
driving your car over.
Or did they?

2249
01:45:09,971 --> 01:45:13,070
If the streets like if somehow like if
you were riding on the highway and if

2250
01:45:13,071 --> 01:45:16,070
you want to fuel up that you can like
fuel up using the road.

2251
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:17,960
Like pay like a fee or something.

2252
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:23,900
Ideally it would be great if solar
panels had gotten so powerful.

2253
01:45:23,950 --> 01:45:27,340
They can charge it just with the sun,
especially because southern California

2254
01:45:27,341 --> 01:45:29,210
is always fucking sunny except for
today,

2255
01:45:29,630 --> 01:45:32,930
but it's a matter of time.
The cars of the future.

2256
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:34,160
That's what it is.
It really is.

2257
01:45:34,161 --> 01:45:37,070
Look,
I'm a giant fan of American muscle cars

2258
01:45:37,250 --> 01:45:39,320
there.
My all time favorite cars in terms of

2259
01:45:39,330 --> 01:45:42,650
like to drive to hear the rumble of the
engine and that I love them.

2260
01:45:42,890 --> 01:45:47,450
I love them.
Maybe I'm some crazy old dude from the

2261
01:45:47,451 --> 01:45:50,300
fucking eighties that still loves 19
sixties muscle cars.

2262
01:45:50,510 --> 01:45:52,010
Maybe.
I don't care.

2263
01:45:52,190 --> 01:45:54,770
I love him,
but that fucking cars,

2264
01:45:54,771 --> 01:45:56,510
that future,
that Tesla is the future.

2265
01:45:56,511 --> 01:45:57,800
Like when you drive it,
you realize,

2266
01:45:57,830 --> 01:46:00,140
Oh,
other cars are stupid.

2267
01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:01,013
Is that.

2268
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:04,020
That's that new room.
New Crazy rocket today.

2269
01:46:04,190 --> 01:46:06,410
Shooting rockets out in his backyard.
Is that his house?

2270
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:10,430
Is there anything that you don't like on
the day or something that kind of bugs

2271
01:46:10,431 --> 01:46:12,130
you that you wish was like,
oh,

2272
01:46:12,210 --> 01:46:14,030
I don't have.
There's no door handles.

2273
01:46:14,350 --> 01:46:14,710
No,

2274
01:46:14,710 --> 01:46:15,250
no,
no.

2275
01:46:15,250 --> 01:46:16,970
Nothing.
You just got to figure it out.

2276
01:46:16,990 --> 01:46:20,890
It just takes a little while to figure
out what all different buttons do and

2277
01:46:20,930 --> 01:46:22,480
how to,
how to get things to happen,

2278
01:46:22,481 --> 01:46:25,180
but it's really well thought out.
It's a look.

2279
01:46:25,660 --> 01:46:28,240
He's a legit genius,
you know,

2280
01:46:28,241 --> 01:46:31,770
and what he's doing is unprecedented and
you know,

2281
01:46:31,780 --> 01:46:34,240
this is gonna sound like I'm kissing his
ass because I liked him because he did

2282
01:46:34,241 --> 01:46:36,260
the podcast and then I became friends
with them.

2283
01:46:36,380 --> 01:46:41,380
Know he's important.
The guys got ideas that are of a

2284
01:46:41,591 --> 01:46:44,740
magnitude that dummies,
like you and me are never going to come

2285
01:46:44,741 --> 01:46:48,040
up with any of those ideas ever.
If we lived a thousand lives,

2286
01:46:48,190 --> 01:46:49,770
we would never figure out space x.

2287
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:53,550
it's just not in our wheelhouse.
We would never make a fucking electric

2288
01:46:53,551 --> 01:46:55,080
car.
We never make one of those things.

2289
01:46:55,090 --> 01:46:57,180
Never make a.
That Tesla roadster that's going to come

2290
01:46:57,181 --> 01:46:59,580
out.
That goes zero to 60 in one point nine

2291
01:46:59,581 --> 01:47:03,390
seconds and looks like like a spaceship,
like a,

2292
01:47:03,570 --> 01:47:05,550
like a race car spaceship from the
future.

2293
01:47:05,850 --> 01:47:07,650
We're not doing that dude.
We need people like that.

2294
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:10,650
Those guys are super important.
This guy is a.

2295
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:14,610
he's like a a culture changer,
like a legit culture changer.

2296
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:20,150
He got him to smoke weed.
Jesus they want to do is the ad blocker

2297
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:24,060
bus to want.
I'm looking forward to new Toyota supra.

2298
01:47:25,530 --> 01:47:28,800
That's the new one.
Looks Dope.

2299
01:47:29,290 --> 01:47:33,720
So this is the a space x rocket.
So what does it say at the top?

2300
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:37,740
It says,
built a stainless steel rocket ship in

2301
01:47:37,741 --> 01:47:41,550
Texas that looks like liquid silver and
might launch in February.

2302
01:47:41,850 --> 01:47:44,340
Didn't what year?
What Day is this article?

2303
01:47:46,170 --> 01:47:47,420
January 11th.
A couple weeks ago.

2304
01:47:47,430 --> 01:47:49,690
Okay.
It fell over and I know that they've

2305
01:47:49,710 --> 01:47:52,560
been doing stuff more with it,
but I just how cool it looks it looks

2306
01:47:52,561 --> 01:47:53,770
like.
But I mean it did now.

2307
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:56,160
It fell on the ground while I was
standing there.

2308
01:47:56,210 --> 01:47:56,791
Yeah.
Yeah.

2309
01:47:56,791 --> 01:48:01,020
It got blown over the wind.
It looks like a drawing for a rocket

2310
01:48:01,021 --> 01:48:03,210
from the 19 hundreds.
I don't know if he did it on purpose,

2311
01:48:03,211 --> 01:48:06,900
but it looks just like.
It looks like a fucking movie.

2312
01:48:06,901 --> 01:48:11,901
Like buck Rogers Rogers rocket.
You're right.

2313
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:15,360
It looks dope though.
Roger's do.

2314
01:48:15,540 --> 01:48:18,480
Driving that car really feels like like
the future.

2315
01:48:18,481 --> 01:48:20,640
And did you get the best model or is
that.

2316
01:48:21,550 --> 01:48:23,370
Of course he did.
But yeah,

2317
01:48:23,371 --> 01:48:26,970
I got the model s p 100 ds.
What it's called.

2318
01:48:27,210 --> 01:48:30,570
I just paid off my car and might just
sell it and get one of those.

2319
01:48:31,420 --> 01:48:34,880
So have a place to park it that has a
little charge port.

2320
01:48:34,881 --> 01:48:37,440
Yeah,
I mean I have it in a power outlet.

2321
01:48:37,890 --> 01:48:39,120
I think you'd probably convert it.
Yeah,

2322
01:48:39,121 --> 01:48:39,640
yeah,
yeah.

2323
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:41,430
There's a couple of superchargers in
Burbank.

2324
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:42,720
Yeah,
there's one across the street,

2325
01:48:42,721 --> 01:48:44,340
but it's always taken.
I don't know what the.

2326
01:48:44,490 --> 01:48:46,920
You know,
what's weird man passing by gas stations

2327
01:48:46,921 --> 01:48:48,810
and going,
I'm never going to use it with this.

2328
01:48:49,170 --> 01:48:50,850
I've never pull it in there unless I
want a soda.

2329
01:48:51,470 --> 01:48:55,680
Look at that thing.
That's zero to 60 in one point nine

2330
01:48:55,681 --> 01:48:57,090
seconds.
And I'm telling you,

2331
01:48:57,091 --> 01:48:58,740
man,
that's not an unrealistic number.

2332
01:48:58,770 --> 01:49:00,930
Six hundred 20 miles.
Yes.

2333
01:49:00,990 --> 01:49:01,860
Wait,
when does this come out?

2334
01:49:01,950 --> 01:49:04,590
A couple of years.
It's going to be awhile.

2335
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:09,240
Uh,
I'm going to get at 100 percent by your

2336
01:49:09,241 --> 01:49:11,130
old one.
This is such a dope car,

2337
01:49:11,131 --> 01:49:11,970
man.
It doesn't even make sense.

2338
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,990
Why has it not have a side mirror?
It's got no side mirrors as cameras.

2339
01:49:16,230 --> 01:49:18,900
Fuck the rendering of it.
Probably shut your mouth.

2340
01:49:19,540 --> 01:49:22,050
God Damn side mirror you.
Sons of bitches.

2341
01:49:22,090 --> 01:49:25,350
I,
I love my camera cameras on my car.

2342
01:49:25,351 --> 01:49:28,530
I don't even use my side mirrors.
It's so much better having that look at

2343
01:49:28,531 --> 01:49:30,390
that thing.
How much is that?

2344
01:49:30,930 --> 01:49:31,860
600.
Twenty miles.

2345
01:49:31,861 --> 01:49:32,940
I Dunno.
Probably stupid.

2346
01:49:32,941 --> 01:49:34,230
Expensive.
Look how pretty it is.

2347
01:49:34,290 --> 01:49:37,530
It's too pretty to be cheap.
Got fucking sick.

2348
01:49:37,531 --> 01:49:38,940
That thing looks.
Look at it.

2349
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:43,190
I mean it's like the ultimate sports car
like that looks like a.

2350
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:45,330
That easily could be a new nine slash
11.

2351
01:49:45,810 --> 01:49:48,550
Like from that angle particularly.
And then the roof comes off.

2352
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:51,430
Cameras Look at those game receipts
right there.

2353
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:52,240
Well not only that,
but.

2354
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:55,960
Well that's what racing seats.
That's why they were racing seats first

2355
01:49:55,961 --> 01:49:56,810
and then became gamers.

2356
01:49:57,130 --> 01:49:59,830
But the steering wheel's wonky steering
wheels.

2357
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:02,170
Like a [inaudible],
like a formula one car.

2358
01:50:02,171 --> 01:50:02,861
See it?
Oh,

2359
01:50:02,861 --> 01:50:03,870
it's like square.
Yeah.

2360
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:05,980
Yeah.
It's like you grab it by the handles.

2361
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:10,800
Maybe they want to make sure that you
don't do this kind of shit like you.

2362
01:50:10,990 --> 01:50:14,680
This is so fast.
You probably need to hold onto it in a

2363
01:50:14,681 --> 01:50:16,600
different way.
Dude,

2364
01:50:16,630 --> 01:50:19,910
I'm telling you that the car that I.
That I got beautiful.

2365
01:50:20,260 --> 01:50:22,240
I've never experienced anything like
that before.

2366
01:50:22,250 --> 01:50:25,420
You don't think it's real.
You don't think a car can do that?

2367
01:50:25,421 --> 01:50:28,090
Doesn't make any sense.
Why do you want her $45,000?

2368
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:31,780
Damn.
Chop back chat.

2369
01:50:31,781 --> 01:50:34,180
Oh my gosh,
that's five plus the 5,000.

2370
01:50:35,180 --> 01:50:38,030
Fifty thousand to 50.
Yeah.

2371
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:40,630
It's probably gonna sell out in five
seconds to pay it.

2372
01:50:41,110 --> 01:50:43,450
Every.
Every dickhead in Hollywood will have

2373
01:50:43,451 --> 01:50:44,410
one.
Look at me.

2374
01:50:44,411 --> 01:50:48,300
I'm environmentally conscious,
but still success look like I'm an open

2375
01:50:48,310 --> 01:50:49,150
shirt to do.

2376
01:50:49,150 --> 01:50:49,481
Do,
do,

2377
01:50:49,481 --> 01:50:49,841
do,
do,

2378
01:50:49,841 --> 01:50:52,390
do.
I went into a volt the other day as an

2379
01:50:52,420 --> 01:50:54,010
uber.
Now is amazed by that.

2380
01:50:55,030 --> 01:50:57,300
Pretty sweet.
I think that's a hybrid right now.

2381
01:50:57,310 --> 01:50:58,400
It's all electric.
Yeah.

2382
01:50:58,401 --> 01:51:01,660
I mean it had like five different
cameras and it was pretty sweet.

2383
01:51:01,690 --> 01:51:03,770
Did he ask him how long the range is a
he?

2384
01:51:03,771 --> 01:51:05,320
Yeah.
It wasn't as good as I think of.

2385
01:51:05,321 --> 01:51:08,230
It's like 2:30,
I think he said that's not bad though.

2386
01:51:08,260 --> 01:51:11,230
If you drive it around Hollywood,
you could probably get a whole night and

2387
01:51:11,250 --> 01:51:14,470
you know if you're ubering.
Audi just announced theirs yesterday

2388
01:51:14,471 --> 01:51:15,970
with a super bowl commercial.
Oh,

2389
01:51:15,971 --> 01:51:17,200
it looks nasty.
I've seen it.

2390
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:18,460
It looks for honesty.
Yeah,

2391
01:51:18,461 --> 01:51:20,890
it looks nasty.
Like Jesse Jackson.

2392
01:51:20,891 --> 01:51:24,640
Nastier bad nasties.
Ms Dot Jackson and it looks like A.

2393
01:51:24,690 --> 01:51:28,030
I think it's a different one.
I'm thinking of the r eight they took

2394
01:51:28,820 --> 01:51:32,780
kit that I get the look,
that stupid girl.

2395
01:51:32,940 --> 01:51:35,080
It looks like a regular Audi's what it
looks like,

2396
01:51:35,350 --> 01:51:40,350
but a Audi.
Google a audi electric sportscar.

2397
01:51:40,990 --> 01:51:45,280
There's one that doesn't look bad.
It looks like a stock standard suv.

2398
01:51:45,281 --> 01:51:48,940
That looks pretty good.
Second Mile on that thing.

2399
01:51:48,941 --> 01:51:51,160
What's the mileage?
The range.

2400
01:51:51,161 --> 01:51:52,480
The range is everything on these
fucking.

2401
01:51:52,481 --> 01:51:55,900
Exactly.
Because if it's anything below like 300

2402
01:51:55,901 --> 01:51:59,230
miles,
100 back up comparing it,

2403
01:51:59,240 --> 01:52:02,650
it's comparing the amount of time you
charge it and what it takes to charge to

2404
01:52:02,651 --> 01:52:03,700
get certain things.
Oh,

2405
01:52:03,701 --> 01:52:05,320
the model.
The final model.

2406
01:52:05,321 --> 01:52:09,070
Excellent.
He does 144 miles and 160 miles.

2407
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:10,510
That ain't good.
It's on that trip.

2408
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:12,280
On that kind of charger or something
like that.

2409
01:52:12,460 --> 01:52:14,200
Dude,
don't estimate.

2410
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:18,070
That ain't good after 30 minutes.
It's only after 30 minutes.

2411
01:52:18,310 --> 01:52:20,080
Oh,
how much you get in 30 minutes?

2412
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:21,600
Well that's not.
That's pretty good info.

2413
01:52:21,690 --> 01:52:25,720
So you can get 160 miles where the
charge in 30 minutes.

2414
01:52:25,750 --> 01:52:27,080
That's not bad.
Faster.

2415
01:52:27,120 --> 01:52:29,680
That's a long time though.
If you've got to go somewhere.

2416
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:32,830
If you're in a rush,
you can't just pull it and get gas,

2417
01:52:33,340 --> 01:52:36,220
but you don't want the kind of power
that would it take.

2418
01:52:36,310 --> 01:52:38,640
I mean,
you imagine how many dip shit.

2419
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:39,840
That's it.
That's the.

2420
01:52:39,870 --> 01:52:41,520
That's the Audi.
Look at that thing Brian.

2421
01:52:42,980 --> 01:52:44,470
Oh yeah.
I like that.

2422
01:52:44,471 --> 01:52:45,310
I like that better.
No,

2423
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:46,720
that's,
that's the one.

2424
01:52:46,730 --> 01:52:50,570
So it's basically an Audi r eight,
a next generation Audi r eight.

2425
01:52:50,750 --> 01:52:53,270
Go to the one.
That's what it looks like.

2426
01:52:53,330 --> 01:52:57,110
That's a nasty looking car.
So dope electric

2427
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:03,640
e-tron that says that says 2016 when
they announced it back at the car shows

2428
01:53:04,251 --> 01:53:07,610
and whatnot.
It's just probably what they're calling.

2429
01:53:07,620 --> 01:53:10,520
See Google,
see if it actually is a real thing or is

2430
01:53:10,521 --> 01:53:14,750
it still just a concept because a,
they always like,

2431
01:53:15,110 --> 01:53:16,130
there's a lot of those cars.

2432
01:53:16,130 --> 01:53:18,620
They'll disappoint shit out of you.
Two hundred $79.

2433
01:53:18,621 --> 01:53:19,810
Million Miles.
Oh,

2434
01:53:19,820 --> 01:53:20,750
it's.
So it's a real thing.

2435
01:53:21,170 --> 01:53:24,860
When is it available?
Wonder when that's going on.

2436
01:53:25,690 --> 01:53:27,110
Said Twenty,
22 right there.

2437
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:28,491
20,
22.

2438
01:53:28,491 --> 01:53:30,710
Yeah.
So that's probably the same time the

2439
01:53:30,711 --> 01:53:33,260
rose just coming out.
But look how they get your Dick hard

2440
01:53:33,350 --> 01:53:36,260
years in advance.
She could have ordered it in 2015.

2441
01:53:36,261 --> 01:53:37,970
So rude though.
Oh Man.

2442
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:40,310
So rude to get your dick hard so far in
advance.

2443
01:53:40,390 --> 01:53:41,430
Yeah.
You know,

2444
01:53:41,450 --> 01:53:42,141
like if you're like,
yeah,

2445
01:53:42,141 --> 01:53:45,430
I'm going to be fucking super
environmental but I'm going to show,

2446
01:53:45,530 --> 01:53:48,210
but it would still be stunting.
Wow.

2447
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:52,640
Do you see the new Volkswagen Dune
buggy?

2448
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:54,140
That looks pretty fun.
No.

2449
01:53:54,170 --> 01:53:55,400
What is that?
It's a cell.

2450
01:53:55,470 --> 01:53:57,440
A Dune buggy.
It was just announced.

2451
01:53:57,500 --> 01:53:59,870
Uh,
I'm not sure if when it's for sale or if

2452
01:53:59,871 --> 01:54:01,400
it's for sale,
but it looks pretty fun.

2453
01:54:01,401 --> 01:54:03,920
It's a,
it looks like a classic Dune Buggy,

2454
01:54:03,921 --> 01:54:08,000
but they vote Volkswagen date and it has
no roof,

2455
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:13,190
but it was like a little fun car and on
the third see a picture of that and um,

2456
01:54:14,170 --> 01:54:16,120
yeah.
All right.

2457
01:54:18,530 --> 01:54:19,880
It's a new one.
Yeah.

2458
01:54:20,160 --> 01:54:21,770
So it looks kind of cool.
Right?

2459
01:54:21,860 --> 01:54:25,160
Whoa.
You could drive that on the road.

2460
01:54:25,340 --> 01:54:27,080
Yeah.
So it's a road car,

2461
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:30,620
but is it still a Dune buggy?
Twenty to 25 again,

2462
01:54:33,380 --> 01:54:36,110
you sons of bitches.
That looks fun.

2463
01:54:36,260 --> 01:54:38,690
Well,
they were supposed to announce the new

2464
01:54:38,691 --> 01:54:41,030
Bronco.
Everybody thought it was going to happen

2465
01:54:41,031 --> 01:54:44,300
at the Detroit auto show,
but it came and went,

2466
01:54:44,750 --> 01:54:48,830
came and went with no bronco.
That makes no sense that because it's

2467
01:54:48,890 --> 01:54:51,950
actually on their website,
like they were going to announce it soon

2468
01:54:51,951 --> 01:54:53,330
as for sale.
I thought,

2469
01:54:53,510 --> 01:54:56,480
I don't think they said that they were
gonna they probably don't have it down.

2470
01:54:56,481 --> 01:54:58,070
You know,
sometimes when they're working on these

2471
01:54:58,071 --> 01:55:01,460
experimental vehicles they uh,
they'll develop something but then they

2472
01:55:01,461 --> 01:55:05,060
don't like certain aspects of it or then
maybe they are aware of a competitors

2473
01:55:05,061 --> 01:55:06,920
work that might come out with more
horsepower.

2474
01:55:07,070 --> 01:55:08,900
So they have to,
like for instance,

2475
01:55:08,901 --> 01:55:09,890
like the,
um,

2476
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:13,360
the gt $500 from Ford,
uh,

2477
01:55:13,550 --> 01:55:17,660
it was on its way out there.
There we're going to put it out the new

2478
01:55:17,661 --> 01:55:21,290
one,
but they were saying that it has over

2479
01:55:21,291 --> 01:55:23,510
700 horsepower.
That's a.

2480
01:55:23,511 --> 01:55:26,270
They never say that.
They always give you the exact specific

2481
01:55:26,271 --> 01:55:29,440
number.
They always say 750 horsepower is coming

2482
01:55:29,450 --> 01:55:30,800
in 20,
20 there website.

2483
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:31,820
Okay.
But did,

2484
01:55:31,910 --> 01:55:35,260
they didn't show it at the.
Not going to make a special day for

2485
01:55:35,450 --> 01:55:38,270
that.
That might be interested in going to be

2486
01:55:38,271 --> 01:55:39,770
nasty.
Look and see what it looks like.

2487
01:55:40,250 --> 01:55:42,660
It looks cool as fuck,
right?

2488
01:55:43,130 --> 01:55:44,790
That's right.
It's the Ford website doesn't have

2489
01:55:44,791 --> 01:55:46,230
pictures of it because they haven't
released it yet.

2490
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:48,330
Um,
but uh,

2491
01:55:48,510 --> 01:55:49,350
what was I just saying?

2492
01:55:52,570 --> 01:55:57,570
What was I just saying?
I said we're talking about what before

2493
01:55:57,601 --> 01:56:00,690
the Bronco,
the Volkswagen Beetle bug.

2494
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:03,000
Oh,
you were saying the Bronco.

2495
01:56:05,150 --> 01:56:10,010
I don't remember.
Jamie fucked me about how that's getting

2496
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:12,360
pushed back because you know,
somebody who might like,

2497
01:56:12,361 --> 01:56:13,440
this car's faster.
Yeah,

2498
01:56:13,470 --> 01:56:16,880
that's right.
The shelby gt 500.

2499
01:56:17,250 --> 01:56:19,850
They said it's only so it's over 700
horsepower.

2500
01:56:19,900 --> 01:56:24,060
The reason why they said that is because
dodge came out with the demon and then

2501
01:56:24,061 --> 01:56:26,520
they came out with some other version of
the hellcat.

2502
01:56:26,580 --> 01:56:30,600
It's also an 800 horsepower,
so if you come out with only 700

2503
01:56:30,601 --> 01:56:34,860
horsepower,
it's hard because is ridiculous as that

2504
01:56:34,861 --> 01:56:36,570
sounds.
Some people gonna think you,

2505
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:40,650
but it's not the Zr one that's good.
Seven 50 or it's not that this or that.

2506
01:56:42,020 --> 01:56:44,430
So they.
They haven't said exactly what the

2507
01:56:44,431 --> 01:56:46,920
horsepower rating is because they're
still trying to juice it up.

2508
01:56:47,410 --> 01:56:49,080
That might be the case of the Bronco
too.

2509
01:56:49,230 --> 01:56:51,780
They might be trying to fix things and
choose things,

2510
01:56:52,110 --> 01:56:54,990
but look how good that looks.
Red with the black stripes.

2511
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:57,240
Good Lord.
Love black seat.

2512
01:56:57,360 --> 01:57:01,770
That cars are reckless person's car.
That's the difference between that and

2513
01:57:01,771 --> 01:57:04,200
like a tesla.
What's exciting about that car?

2514
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:07,200
The way it looks,
that is a ridiculous person's car.

2515
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:10,720
I can drive around every day.
Your fucking madman.

2516
01:57:10,740 --> 01:57:12,750
You probably a little tipsy.
Sometimes you drive,

2517
01:57:13,160 --> 01:57:16,770
you know you might smoke cigarettes,
you definitely smoke cigars,

2518
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:19,500
you know,
you probably order shots,

2519
01:57:19,770 --> 01:57:21,930
right?
That's a ridiculous person.

2520
01:57:22,810 --> 01:57:25,560
So Fun ass fucking car.
But yeah,

2521
01:57:25,650 --> 01:57:27,390
Quito on weekends.
Look at the.

2522
01:57:27,580 --> 01:57:30,690
The transmission.
Not only is it an automatic,

2523
01:57:31,140 --> 01:57:35,310
it's a wheel.
So you spend a drive like fuck you.

2524
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:39,060
First of all,
give me a goddamn stick shift like an

2525
01:57:39,061 --> 01:57:42,090
American.
I want to stick shift with the fucking

2526
01:57:42,091 --> 01:57:44,670
American flag as the boot of the stick
shift.

2527
01:57:44,671 --> 01:57:46,410
It's one of the last places on the
planet.

2528
01:57:46,650 --> 01:57:48,570
We could still get a goddamn stick
shifts.

2529
01:57:48,571 --> 01:57:52,530
Sports car and what it's for.
Do they release the GT 500 with an

2530
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:54,450
automatic.
How dare you?

2531
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:58,740
Don't talk to me about paddles both.
You can shift it manually with the

2532
01:57:58,741 --> 01:57:59,574
paddle.

2533
01:58:02,770 --> 01:58:04,660
That's not a manual transmission,
sir.

2534
01:58:04,661 --> 01:58:06,040
That's shifting.
And with the paddles.

2535
01:58:06,360 --> 01:58:07,640
Where's my.
What's my left foot doing?

2536
01:58:07,670 --> 01:58:10,030
Should I pretend?
How about give me a fake clutch.

2537
01:58:11,050 --> 01:58:14,050
Clutch record.
Pretend they looked dope though.

2538
01:58:14,250 --> 01:58:14,711
We've got it.
Good.

2539
01:58:14,711 --> 01:58:16,300
That silver one?
It looks sexy.

2540
01:58:16,420 --> 01:58:18,450
Several with the black stripes.
Goddammit.

2541
01:58:18,570 --> 01:58:20,140
So the red one with the black stripes
too.

2542
01:58:20,230 --> 01:58:23,470
So these come out later this year at the
end of the year Kinda?

2543
01:58:23,770 --> 01:58:24,640
Yeah,
I think so.

2544
01:58:24,700 --> 01:58:26,260
Are they.
I guess they haven't announced it yet so

2545
01:58:26,680 --> 01:58:28,780
I don't think they have announced a
specific data comes out,

2546
01:58:29,590 --> 01:58:32,320
but it looks like it's got wider
bodywork too,

2547
01:58:32,321 --> 01:58:34,570
doesn't it?
Like the fenders are wider and the rear

2548
01:58:34,571 --> 01:58:36,730
and the front.
But you if you want,

2549
01:58:36,731 --> 01:58:38,980
if you don't want to wait,
you can get something even more

2550
01:58:38,981 --> 01:58:41,440
powerful.
That is available right now with a

2551
01:58:41,441 --> 01:58:42,550
manual transmission.

2552
01:58:42,580 --> 01:58:47,310
You get the shelby super snake Google
that you want to see America at.

2553
01:58:47,311 --> 01:58:48,910
It's rock hard,
finest.

2554
01:58:49,330 --> 01:58:53,050
Two thousand 19 or 18 shelby super
snake,

2555
01:58:53,410 --> 01:58:58,410
800 motherfucking horsepower wide body
Mustang with a manual transmission and

2556
01:59:00,881 --> 01:59:03,760
they say don't even fuck with the
automatic because the automatic

2557
01:59:03,761 --> 01:59:06,730
transmission is the transmission from a
regular automatic Mustang and it just

2558
01:59:06,731 --> 01:59:10,450
doesn't know what the fuck to do.
I mean it's just,

2559
01:59:10,540 --> 01:59:13,120
it's,
it's confused by this thing.

2560
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:16,270
The car is 800 horsepower.
Turn that volume up

2561
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:30,790
to me,
that's sexy,

2562
01:59:30,791 --> 01:59:32,530
but net worth 117 pounds

2563
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:38,630
getting a communist mouth.
That is a monster of a car.

2564
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:40,700
Good Lord,
that's a beautiful thing

2565
01:59:40,950 --> 01:59:43,130
on your tesla.
Can you download sound effects that

2566
01:59:43,140 --> 01:59:45,630
sounds like that.
You don't want that.

2567
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:48,180
You want to just just be cool.
Just chill.

2568
01:59:49,140 --> 01:59:52,200
Tesla's like you're,
you're a man of leisure.

2569
01:59:52,300 --> 01:59:54,300
You're a man of leisure and driving
around.

2570
01:59:54,930 --> 01:59:58,050
Comfortable and quiet is it flies
around.

2571
01:59:58,380 --> 02:00:00,020
It's like it's going through a wormhole
everywhere.

2572
02:00:00,021 --> 02:00:02,310
You drive it.
Very strange car.

2573
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,940
Have you tried to self driving?
Have you?

2574
02:00:06,060 --> 02:00:07,380
Um,
nerve wracking,

2575
02:00:07,381 --> 02:00:08,480
isn't it?
Having prayer.

2576
02:00:08,481 --> 02:00:10,680
It took me on at once and it's pretty
scary.

2577
02:00:11,270 --> 02:00:13,800
Yeah.
Bryan county does that thinks beaten

2578
02:00:13,820 --> 02:00:14,850
awful lot.
Was driving.

2579
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:19,590
Put Porn on that big screen on here.
You can know.

2580
02:00:19,700 --> 02:00:20,533
Yeah.

2581
02:00:22,420 --> 02:00:24,300
That's great.
Can you imagine just driving,

2582
02:00:24,570 --> 02:00:26,880
people are on autopilot just beaten off
to porn.

2583
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:28,050
That giant ass screen.

2584
02:00:28,120 --> 02:00:31,600
Does it have a web browser in it seems
like I haven't even looked,

2585
02:00:31,630 --> 02:00:33,370
man.
I'm sure it does something.

2586
02:00:33,490 --> 02:00:35,290
Yeah,
you could probably get online if it's

2587
02:00:35,291 --> 02:00:36,850
parked or something ridiculous like
that.

2588
02:00:37,180 --> 02:00:38,830
It's a crazy car,
but it,

2589
02:00:38,831 --> 02:00:39,451
it,
it's,

2590
02:00:39,451 --> 02:00:42,190
it's,
it seems like such a leap from anything

2591
02:00:42,191 --> 02:00:44,320
that I've ever driven before.
Like,

2592
02:00:44,410 --> 02:00:45,243
I've never,

2593
02:00:45,690 --> 02:00:47,700
I've never experienced anything remotely
close to it,

2594
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:51,610
so let's go fucking play some quick.
So,

2595
02:00:51,611 --> 02:00:54,180
um,
I said everything I wanted to say about

2596
02:00:54,181 --> 02:00:55,560
the,
the Jack Dorsey thing,

2597
02:00:55,790 --> 02:00:58,530
um,
I've said everything I wanted to say to

2598
02:00:58,740 --> 02:01:02,190
Alex Jones,
so my olive branch extended to you,

2599
02:01:02,191 --> 02:01:04,170
Mr Jones.
I wish you well in this life.

2600
02:01:04,590 --> 02:01:06,720
Um,
and everybody else will do better.

2601
02:01:06,750 --> 02:01:10,320
We're going to definitely have jack back
on and we're going to have jack back on

2602
02:01:10,710 --> 02:01:13,300
and review some of these cases with some
of the people that are in charge with

2603
02:01:13,301 --> 02:01:14,540
it,
um,

2604
02:01:15,120 --> 02:01:18,570
of it rather.
And we're going to compile a list.

2605
02:01:18,630 --> 02:01:23,630
We're going to try to get someone to
compile a list of what they think would

2606
02:01:23,971 --> 02:01:28,830
be contradictory cases or hypocritical
cases are interesting cases or just fuel

2607
02:01:28,831 --> 02:01:30,990
for conversation and we'll figure it
out.

2608
02:01:31,020 --> 02:01:32,370
And uh,
and yeah,

2609
02:01:32,371 --> 02:01:34,680
the cash apps.
One of the sponsors of the podcast,

2610
02:01:34,750 --> 02:01:38,070
I'm 99 point nine percent sure we said
that

2611
02:01:39,820 --> 02:01:43,250
I'm not positive we did because we
talked about Justin wren fight for the

2612
02:01:43,251 --> 02:01:47,630
forgotten charity about what that code
word Rogan is doing for pygmies in the

2613
02:01:47,631 --> 02:01:47,990
Congo.

2614
02:01:47,990 --> 02:01:50,150
When they do that,
I swear to you,

2615
02:01:50,151 --> 02:01:51,550
even though you don't have to believe
me,

2616
02:01:51,570 --> 02:01:53,450
that did not affect how I talked to that
guy.

2617
02:01:53,480 --> 02:01:55,880
I don't have a problem getting sponsors.
I got plenty of sponsors.

2618
02:01:55,881 --> 02:01:57,500
It's a good sponsor.
I liked them.

2619
02:01:57,860 --> 02:02:01,730
They do good things.
They donate $5 to UFC fighter Ray Borg

2620
02:02:01,731 --> 02:02:04,880
son's medical bills for every time
someone uses the code Joe Rogan.

2621
02:02:05,270 --> 02:02:09,560
So I like them.
If I had them as a sponsor and I

2622
02:02:09,561 --> 02:02:12,800
couldn't talk freely with him,
I would be happy if they dropped me,

2623
02:02:12,860 --> 02:02:17,860
I would be way happier for them to drop
me than I would for me to say something

2624
02:02:18,411 --> 02:02:21,170
different or not say something because
they're a sponsor.

2625
02:02:22,020 --> 02:02:24,470
Again,
that sounds very self serving,

2626
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:25,870
like you would say that.
Right?

2627
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,370
But it's true.
So that's all I can tell you.

2628
02:02:28,610 --> 02:02:30,920
All right,
so that's it for today.

2629
