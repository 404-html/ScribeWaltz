1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,360
Hello Freak bitches could Joe Rogan.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,353
Hmm

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:07,430
hmm.

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,480
Have everything go away.

5
00:00:08,481 --> 00:00:09,141
Your kids are fine.

6
00:00:09,141 --> 00:00:09,891
You have your relationships.

7
00:00:09,891 --> 00:00:10,131
Cool.

8
00:00:10,131 --> 00:00:10,490
Whatever.

9
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:11,840
Let's take that element out of it.

10
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,250
Let's just take the house,

11
00:00:13,251 --> 00:00:14,084
the cash,

12
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,260
the bows and arrows.

13
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:16,663
It's all gone.

14
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,680
Could Joe Rogan go live in,

15
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,820
let's just pick New York,

16
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:24,050
this is not a city question,

17
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,120
but let's pick New York.

18
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:29,180
Could you go live down by
Washington Square Park in a studio,

19
00:00:29,181 --> 00:00:30,740
apartment heavier act.

20
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:35,150
Have your fans go do your thing and kind
of be okay with a low bank account or

21
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:35,810
have you got,

22
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,820
are you at an age now and you've,

23
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,590
you've had stability.

24
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,360
Do you feel like that would freak you out?

25
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,640
Well it would definitely freak
you out if you all the sudden,

26
00:00:45,641 --> 00:00:47,740
like one of the things that I've,

27
00:00:47,741 --> 00:00:48,574
uh,

28
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,730
sort of relied on is not needing anything.

29
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:52,270
Right?

30
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,920
So by not needing anything,

31
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:54,551
everything I do,

32
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:56,050
I do because I enjoy it.

33
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:56,400
Right?

34
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,700
So like if I do stand up,

35
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:02,560
I do it cause I enjoy it
and if I do podcasts because
I enjoy it if I do the UFC

36
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:03,250
is cause I enjoy it.

37
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,780
I enjoy the money is done.

38
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,740
Don't get me wrong.

39
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,130
Sure.

40
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,480
But I'm not neat.

41
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,410
I'm not needy.

42
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,170
I'm not in a position where I'm
like worried about my next check.

43
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,250
I need that stuff.

44
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,450
So if I got to that,

45
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:13,810
yeah,

46
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:13,990
not,

47
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,250
not even need that stuff.

48
00:01:15,251 --> 00:01:19,520
Like neither stuff has kind of like if
you have a car and you can get around

49
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:19,611
you,

50
00:01:19,611 --> 00:01:22,330
if you got food on the table
and your family's taken care of,

51
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,580
everything else is kind of bullshit.

52
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:25,810
It's nice.

53
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,400
It's nice to have a good couch.

54
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:27,551
Like,

55
00:01:27,551 --> 00:01:28,000
look,

56
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,410
we have a 70 inch TV.

57
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,010
Ooh,

58
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,060
this is nice.

59
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,093
Feels Nice.

60
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,660
But Watch Westworld on a 70 inch TV.

61
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:35,261
It's nice.

62
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,080
Look how big it is.

63
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,913
Woo.

64
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,640
But ultimately what really counts is,

65
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,050
are you nervous?

66
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,550
Are you nervous about your bills?

67
00:01:42,551 --> 00:01:43,150
Cause like,

68
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,140
do you remember that feeling?

69
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,283
Yeah.

70
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:45,710
Yeah.

71
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,830
That's how terrible feeling.

72
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,080
I never worried about what,

73
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,590
where that's going to come from
and what you're going to do.

74
00:01:50,591 --> 00:01:52,870
But you still have your act.

75
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,130
You can still go make money,

76
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,290
but we're going to put
you back at square one.

77
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:58,210
We're going to put you
in that studio apartment.

78
00:01:58,211 --> 00:01:58,630
Could you,

79
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,870
could,

80
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,800
would you be cool with it?

81
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,940
I'll studios cost small one.

82
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,820
Oh like a four bedroom house
with a yard and some work.

83
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,210
No,

84
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,710
but honestly the,

85
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,060
the big thing,

86
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,200
and this is such a cliche,

87
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,540
but the big thing is do
I still have my friends?

88
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,640
Do I still have the same friends?

89
00:02:13,641 --> 00:02:17,570
Because like if I lived in an apartment
building and Ari Shaffir lived next door

90
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,090
or any Donkin live down the
hallway and Joey was the uh,

91
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,053
over the other side.

92
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:21,440
Yeah,

93
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,273
I have a great time.

94
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:22,810
Yeah.

95
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,480
We all lived on the same floor,

96
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,280
the same building.

97
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,510
I would have zero problem with that.

98
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,590
If they knocked on the door.

99
00:02:27,591 --> 00:02:27,891
Hey man,

100
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:28,401
you got any weed?

101
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:29,150
I'm going to wait.

102
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,983
Come on.

103
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,560
Exactly.

104
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,270
That would be no problem at all.

105
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:35,030
It's like how much different is that
then when you stay on the road in the

106
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:35,510
hotel,

107
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:35,960
right.

108
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,670
Because the hotel is
like a studio apartment.

109
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:38,170
Yeah.

110
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:38,900
And you're right.

111
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,490
Good percentage of our lives.

112
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,430
We stay in a studio apartment a lot.

113
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:42,920
I know.

114
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,660
I really,

115
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,180
and I bring it up cause I really,

116
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:48,090
I was thinking about it and
it's like if it all fell apart,

117
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:52,560
like he grab you grab on to your
lifestyle and what you're doing so hard,

118
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,210
but if at all for whatever reason washed
away and you could still go perform and

119
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:58,860
you still had your friends at this club,

120
00:02:58,861 --> 00:03:00,960
he could go see whatever it's,

121
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,780
it's,

122
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,860
I could totally do it.

123
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:08,070
I could totally go back to I have clothes
that fit in this big of a closet and

124
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,110
just,

125
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,460
and just keep doing what I'm doing.

126
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:17,050
But in those circumstances I
100% in some ways I think your,

127
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,340
you'd be lighter.

128
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,200
You'd be right.

129
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,470
A lot of people do believe that and
a lot of people do go towards that

130
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:25,480
minimalism wife or they
give up everything.

131
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,040
My friend Steve Maxwell,

132
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:27,980
he's a,

133
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,820
a really a world renowned fitness trainer.

134
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,760
Strength and conditioning coach
for a lot of pro athletes.

135
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:34,594
A lot of fighters.

136
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,340
He lives out of a Duffel bag.

137
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:37,061
Oh,

138
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:37,920
I saw that guy.

139
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,870
I saw you interviewed guy.

140
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,190
He used to have a big house and
he had a gym in Philadelphia,

141
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:44,110
you'd like one of the very,

142
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,990
he's one of the very first American
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belts.

143
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:50,560
And he had his gigantic jam
where he's teaching and he said,

144
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,190
you know,

145
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,120
he's an interesting guy.

146
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:53,800
And then he just decided he got divorced,

147
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:54,610
right.

148
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,181
And he decided,

149
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:56,014
you know what,

150
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,040
fuck this.

151
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,341
He goes,

152
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:58,570
I'm going to live out of a van.

153
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,610
And he got like a,

154
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:02,030
a camper van and he lived out of that.

155
00:04:02,031 --> 00:04:02,441
And then he's like,

156
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:03,640
fuck this van I'm getting,

157
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,180
I'm just going to keep traveling now.

158
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,980
He just stays in hotels everywhere.

159
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,070
That's amazing.

160
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,120
And that's what brings it up.

161
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:10,750
It's the divorce.

162
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,583
I see it.

163
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,640
I don't think,

164
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:14,260
I don't think willingly I would do it,

165
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:16,720
but if something was thrust
upon me because he got divorced,

166
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,060
divorced or some something,

167
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:19,961
I would,

168
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:20,740
uh,

169
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,640
I could go back.

170
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,460
I could be like,

171
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:22,761
do you,

172
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:25,100
but you're thinking about it so much
that you brought it up as a subject.

173
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,290
It was something you wonder.

174
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:27,883
Uh,

175
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:28,551
yeah.

176
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:30,230
Not as far as the divorce part of it,

177
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,700
but just the simple life.

178
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,121
Yeah.

179
00:04:32,121 --> 00:04:37,121
Because I've built a life that's
bigger and more complicated and I,

180
00:04:37,371 --> 00:04:37,730
uh,

181
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,740
you want to know what you
want to know what it was.

182
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,810
Last time I was in here,

183
00:04:41,811 --> 00:04:42,261
I had,

184
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:42,700
um,

185
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,860
I had this back issue where it was
like shooting pain down my arm.

186
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,521
Yeah.

187
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:47,480
You had a cervical issue,

188
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:47,661
right?

189
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:48,050
Yeah.

190
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,280
And I was going to,

191
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:49,670
uh,

192
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,110
this really great Cairo guy.

193
00:04:51,111 --> 00:04:52,010
I was doing cupping,

194
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:55,250
I was doing all of this kind of stuff
and it was just making it worse.

195
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:56,620
I was just in words.

196
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,110
Yeah.

197
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,590
I was in,

198
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,690
I was in pain for like a year.

199
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,830
I was like in pain.

200
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,931
Greg row Gal,

201
00:05:02,931 --> 00:05:03,081
you know,

202
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:04,120
the comedian Greggor Gal,

203
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,680
he tells me he had really developed
debilitating lower back pain and he read

204
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,000
[inaudible] book.

205
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:11,450
Yeah.

206
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:11,841
I read,

207
00:05:11,841 --> 00:05:12,140
sorry.

208
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:12,441
He's like,

209
00:05:12,441 --> 00:05:13,041
just read it.

210
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:13,621
And I got it.

211
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:16,580
This big fight with him in the sun and uh,

212
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:17,451
and uh,

213
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:19,310
know him who owns the comedy cellar.

214
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:23,150
He's calling him a crack and it's a
crackpot and it doesn't work and all this

215
00:05:23,151 --> 00:05:23,421
stuff.

216
00:05:23,421 --> 00:05:24,800
And Greg is like,

217
00:05:24,801 --> 00:05:25,790
just please read it.

218
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:26,450
Just read it,

219
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,800
just read it and it's,

220
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,461
you know what it is.

221
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,500
It's just basically about
that you're carrying,

222
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,450
your brain wants to go to
work on something simple
like pain in your body rather

223
00:05:35,451 --> 00:05:40,010
than deal with issues of stress and
anxiety and anger that you carry all the

224
00:05:40,011 --> 00:05:44,210
time and basically just realizing that
that's where the pain is coming from.

225
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,990
Don't have to solve the anxiety
or the pain or the anger.

226
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,820
You just have to be aware,

227
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:50,841
okay brain,

228
00:05:50,841 --> 00:05:51,800
I know what you're doing,

229
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,060
I know what you're working on.

230
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,300
It just kind of alleviates that stress.

231
00:05:56,301 --> 00:06:00,200
And then the physical manifestation
of not having oxygen go into your,

232
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,680
into your muscles and stuff starts
to slowly release and just it,

233
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,453
it's gone.

234
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,533
It's gone.

235
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,020
It's,

236
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,980
I have no pain.

237
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:10,700
I have no,

238
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,580
how long did it take after you read
the book and adopted the principles?

239
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,840
I go month and a half.

240
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:15,500
Really?

241
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:15,950
Yeah.

242
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,730
So a year of pain and then a month and
a half of adopting these principles and

243
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:20,810
like what does he tell you to do?

244
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:20,961
Like,

245
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:22,880
what are the exercises
that he tells you to do?

246
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:23,850
He says,

247
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:24,650
just live.

248
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,900
Don't just a live your life,

249
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:27,471
exercise,

250
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:28,370
whatever you were doing,

251
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:28,910
do it.

252
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,970
Don't live timidly don't
think I can't run now.

253
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,520
I can't do yoga now because
I've got a neck issue.

254
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,410
Do it live your life.

255
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,670
Don't live like in this preventative way
of I can't move or I'm going to mess up

256
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:41,300
my,

257
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:41,930
my body.

258
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,690
So what does he tell you
about like physical issues?

259
00:06:44,691 --> 00:06:48,140
Like what if you have a herniated disc
and it's pressing against your nerve and

260
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,930
it's causing your hands to go
numb and your arms atrophying.

261
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:51,530
He says there's,

262
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,210
those are very rare cases.

263
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,130
It's not that rare in my world.

264
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:55,700
I know.

265
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,271
Well yeah,

266
00:06:56,271 --> 00:06:56,810
you're right.

267
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,620
But he says,

268
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,540
he says it's very rare cases where there's
like a real pinched nerve kind of a

269
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,374
problem.

270
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,090
A lot seems like crazy advice.

271
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,090
I know a lot of people
that have like real issues,

272
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,320
like real physical issues.

273
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:13,190
It's not a rare thing I don't think
to have like disc issues are gigantic.

274
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:13,660
Yeah.

275
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,810
It's cause people,

276
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,460
they don't strengthen their spine enough.

277
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,240
They don't drink their core enough and
they wind up doing something to Yank it

278
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:22,580
and they heard it and then they try
to work around it and they wind up

279
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:24,950
reactivating it and then
it gets worse and worse.

280
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,430
He was saying that the,

281
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,920
a lot of times you'll have,

282
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:28,820
um,

283
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:33,290
you'll have like your disk will be bulging
a little bit or whatever these little

284
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:37,340
imperfections are and we all
have these imperfections in us,

285
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,380
but when you are stressed and the muscles
are tightening around you and becoming

286
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:46,340
inflamed because you're carrying this
stuff that you're not working through,

287
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,990
everything's constricting around it.

288
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:50,780
So then it's going to aggravate that
and that's going to become a bigger

289
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:51,500
problem.

290
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,970
I definitely think that's true.

291
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,820
Um,

292
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,890
and some cases,

293
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,061
but there's like,

294
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:56,871
there's legitimate,

295
00:07:56,871 --> 00:07:59,540
like I had a conversation with a friend
of mine about this with the same sort of

296
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,580
a thing and I was like that.

297
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,840
That's all well and good,

298
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:06,470
but I know people who were very light
and happy people who develop a legitimate

299
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:10,260
back issue and has nothing to do with
stress that they're carrying around and

300
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,000
has to do with the soft tissue
that protects your joints,

301
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,690
bulging out and contacting a nerve.

302
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,393
Look,

303
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,630
there's a zillion of us out there and
I'm sure there's all different issues for

304
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:24,320
it,

305
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,650
but back to your original question of
why am I thinking about simplifying and

306
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:28,550
all this kind of stuff?

307
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,820
I am a pretty light,

308
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,110
positive person,

309
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,100
very optimistic,

310
00:08:34,101 --> 00:08:34,491
very.

311
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:36,530
I kind of live in that world,

312
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,000
but when I just started
reading the book I'm like,

313
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:40,280
I think is really pissing me off.

314
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,360
Am I stressed?

315
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,630
Do I have anxiety because I live in this
house because I'm trying to do these

316
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:48,560
things with my career because I'm trying
to always do this because I'm carrying

317
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,710
children and parents
and all of this stuff.

318
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,690
I'm trying to make everybody happy.

319
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:54,230
I'm just,

320
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,750
I don't know.

321
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,990
Maybe just realizing that
in thinking about it,

322
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,240
I'm in no heavy meditation on it.

323
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:00,570
No.

324
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,540
Just being aware that maybe
that's where it's coming from.

325
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,820
I'm telling you over a month and a half,

326
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,080
the pain slowly went
away and I don't have it.

327
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,990
Yeah,

328
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,890
that is interesting.

329
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,690
So what,

330
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,540
like what was bothering you before?

331
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,770
Like I know that you're,

332
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,251
you know,

333
00:09:19,251 --> 00:09:23,210
you're successful and you had a television
show for a while and you've got a

334
00:09:23,211 --> 00:09:24,500
bunch of projects going on.

335
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:26,840
You're always doing standup and specials,

336
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,400
so you've had a lot of success,

337
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,230
you've got a lot of great stuff going on.

338
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,190
What was,

339
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,080
what was kind of chewing at you?

340
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,331
I don't know.

341
00:09:34,331 --> 00:09:37,570
I'm not really 100% sure
of what the sources,

342
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,900
but I do feel like I have a lot
of people on my back and it's all,

343
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,670
it's all quiet.

344
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,720
It's all in my head,

345
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:47,740
you know what I mean?

346
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,880
A lot of people on your back.

347
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,420
Yeah,

348
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,680
I've got a wife,

349
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,460
I've got,

350
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,510
I've got kids,

351
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,830
I've got pets,

352
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,420
I've got family.

353
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,400
I've got

354
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,530
in the in that you feel
that there's a weird,

355
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,970
weird way to bring this,

356
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,171
bring this up.

357
00:10:02,171 --> 00:10:03,220
But is that,

358
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:04,811
how much of that,

359
00:10:04,811 --> 00:10:06,640
like having a wife and having kids,

360
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:11,410
obviously there's going to be compromises
and there's going to be stressed that

361
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:12,940
comes along with any sort of relationship,

362
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:18,340
but do you feel like it was tipping more
towards the negative than towards the

363
00:10:18,341 --> 00:10:19,174
positive?

364
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,913
Um,

365
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,060
I don't think it was.

366
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,680
I think I just,

367
00:10:23,681 --> 00:10:24,514
uh,

368
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,850
the whole experience to me seems positive.

369
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,520
My relationship with my wife is great.

370
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,790
The kids I adore.

371
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,110
I feel like it's all positive,

372
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:40,120
but I do carry the burden of everybody's
worries and everybody's wellbeing all

373
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:40,361
the time.

374
00:10:40,361 --> 00:10:41,410
I was working on this axis,

375
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:45,700
this joke in my act before I started
thinking about all this stuff I had this

376
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:47,050
moment when I was standing in this house,

377
00:10:47,051 --> 00:10:48,430
I moved to this bigger house.

378
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:49,510
It's a really nice house.

379
00:10:49,511 --> 00:10:51,160
It's a bigger how bigger home.

380
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,270
And I was shutting off all the lights
is what I was working through on stage.

381
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,050
I was turning off all the lights one night
and locking the doors for all the bad

382
00:10:59,051 --> 00:11:00,460
people that are coming to get us.

383
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,820
And everyone's in their beds and the
cat's asleep and the dog's asleep and

384
00:11:03,821 --> 00:11:05,230
everybody the lizard to sleep.

385
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,753
And it just,

386
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,710
all my responsibility washed
over me like everybody,

387
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,500
every living thing here is,

388
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,180
is uh,

389
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,860
depending on my success,

390
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,930
if I don't keep going,

391
00:11:19,931 --> 00:11:22,720
if I don't keep succeeding this,

392
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,120
everything here changes
everybody's little life.

393
00:11:25,121 --> 00:11:25,954
Everybody's Pref,

394
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,460
perfect little existence.

395
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,600
It's all washing over me and
I can't tell anyone about it.

396
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,950
I could tell you the audience,

397
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,770
but I can't go sit on my daughter's bed
at two in the morning when I have that

398
00:11:35,771 --> 00:11:36,604
feeling.

399
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,583
Honey,

400
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,423
you ever,

401
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,720
do you ever feel like you
just can't do it anymore?

402
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,790
You ever feel like he can't,

403
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,440
he just want to stop.

404
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,150
He just want to take a break.

405
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,300
This whole thing about waking
up my daughter with my fears,

406
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,320
I can't do that.

407
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,970
I don't tell my wife that stuff.

408
00:11:51,971 --> 00:11:53,040
I don't tell my kids that stuff.

409
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,010
I just carry it.

410
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,010
So when I started reading this book,

411
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,281
I'm like,

412
00:11:57,281 --> 00:12:01,180
maybe I'm just taking all this
really seriously and feeling like,

413
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,173
hmm.

414
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,073
Did you

415
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,250
extended with the new home?

416
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:05,780
Is that it?

417
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,410
Cause a lot of times I
have a friend of mine,

418
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:08,111
I did that recently.

419
00:12:08,111 --> 00:12:10,380
He bought a big place and uh,

420
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,310
he can afford it,

421
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,870
but kind of right.

422
00:12:12,871 --> 00:12:13,141
You know,

423
00:12:13,141 --> 00:12:13,500
it's like,

424
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,333
okay,

425
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,010
think about this now I'm a,

426
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,380
I'm a big advocate in never doing that.

427
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:19,740
Yeah.

428
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,560
I don't think you should ever buy
a big place unless you're like,

429
00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:22,741
hey,

430
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:24,720
we can get a nice place now
and not even think about it.

431
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,220
Let's,

432
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:25,461
no,

433
00:12:25,461 --> 00:12:26,330
we're totally cool.

434
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,193
We can do it.

435
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,621
And it's,

436
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:27,920
you know,

437
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,200
I hadn't really small place for a
long time and did all the right thing.

438
00:12:31,201 --> 00:12:32,034
So it's,

439
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,390
the outlay is no different
from my little place before.

440
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,740
It's all cool.

441
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,590
But when you walk into a place like that,

442
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,060
it just feels bigger.

443
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:41,720
It just,

444
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:41,961
you know,

445
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,520
the first time I bought a home ever,

446
00:12:43,521 --> 00:12:45,350
I had this little place in studio city.

447
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,160
It's a little,

448
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,520
you know,

449
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:46,881
I just,

450
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:49,760
I remember laying on the couch like,

451
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,511
hi,

452
00:12:50,511 --> 00:12:51,680
I don't know if I can take with this.

453
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,140
I've got to sign this paper.

454
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:55,760
And towards the years is a long,

455
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,420
every time the mail came for the
first year that I owned home,

456
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,030
I thought it was going to be a notice
saying you've got to get out of there now.

457
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,140
You know what I mean?

458
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,471
Yeah.

459
00:13:03,471 --> 00:13:05,000
I just was fearful about it.

460
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,380
Mortgages are weird,

461
00:13:06,381 --> 00:13:06,860
man.

462
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,260
It's like you here's a bill for 30 years,

463
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,220
right?

464
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:10,610
Yeah.

465
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,121
That's heavy.

466
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:11,931
That weighs on you.

467
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:12,764
Yeah.

468
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:16,550
So that's what it just brought
me to the feeling of like,

469
00:13:16,551 --> 00:13:21,530
well maybe just going back and living
with my wife in that little studio

470
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:22,910
apartment in New York again,

471
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,230
wouldn't be so bad.

472
00:13:24,231 --> 00:13:25,100
Kid's a freak out.

473
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,530
It'd be the kids would
free kids would hate it.

474
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,610
The kids would have to be gone.

475
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,220
Fuck this dad.

476
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,430
You need to be more successful.

477
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,043
Yeah.

478
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,270
Just take your pressure like a man ditch.

479
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,860
Why did you downsize?

480
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,200
Who cares if your next
crooked son of a bitch,

481
00:13:39,201 --> 00:13:40,610
who cares if your arms go numb?

482
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,530
I want to go to Berkeley.

483
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,820
Everything's with your teeth.

484
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:45,711
So I don't know.

485
00:13:45,711 --> 00:13:45,981
I mean,

486
00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:46,570
cause it's a,

487
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,450
it was a little self
aware moment because I do,

488
00:13:50,451 --> 00:13:51,021
like I said,

489
00:13:51,021 --> 00:13:51,854
um,

490
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,110
I feel like I'm pretty carefree,

491
00:13:54,111 --> 00:13:56,180
but why the hell was my neck so

492
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,230
[inaudible]

493
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:06,490
okay.
