1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,940
And Five,
four,

2
00:00:02,941 --> 00:00:05,030
three,
two.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:07,890
Yes.
How are you sir?

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:08,780
Good,
thanks.

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,260
Thanks for being here,
man.

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,480
Um,
I wanted to ask you this because I was 

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,530
reading this today and I started to 
freak out a NASA is planning on drilling

8
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:18,900
into yellowstone.
Okay.

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,820
To save the world.
I didn't know about this.

10
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,260
You know,
about the relieving pressure.

11
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:24,120
What are they doing?
Yes.

12
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,400
Yeah,
there's the practice.

13
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,550
We're talking about chiropractors for 
the startup folks.

14
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,280
Uh,
I think they plan on like a,

15
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:37,650
you know how like if you have like a 
giant cyst and you sort of make a slice 

16
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:42,111
in it,
you can kind of squeeze everything out 

17
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:42,111
of there.
Let's see a doctor do that.

18
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:42,650
I've seen doctors do that.
I've never seen this.

19
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:47,651
I do this.
I have no idea NASA wants to send 

20
00:00:47,651 --> 00:00:47,910
through.
NASA wants to spend $3,000,000,000

21
00:00:47,911 --> 00:00:52,911
drilling into a volcano to save the 
United States and a presumably a large 

22
00:00:52,911 --> 00:00:57,831
chunk of the world to write because 
there would be some sort of a nuclear 

23
00:00:57,831 --> 00:00:59,340
winter type scenario where the guys 
would be covered with.

24
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,130
This is not your area of expertise and 
sorry to throw this out,

25
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,470
I wonder,
I wonder about the providence of this,

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,630
but you know,
uh,

27
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,730
these are things that,
it's some people's areas of expertise,

28
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:13,680
but no one has figured everything out,
right?

29
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:18,330
Like we don't know all the forces that 
are pushing around to make volcanoes and

30
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:19,560
earthquakes,
stuff like that.

31
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,450
So back to that picture.
Look at this picture.

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,110
That picture freaks me out.
I think it's realistic.

33
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:28,650
Yeah.
Every six to 800,000

34
00:01:28,651 --> 00:01:29,460
years,
that thing.

35
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:32,610
Blow Sky High.
Microsoft paint version of geophysics.

36
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:32,990
Yeah.
Yeah.

37
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:36,420
It's from like a geocities site from 
1994.

38
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,710
Yeah.
Well,

39
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,090
here's the thing,
they have to think about it,

40
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:40,530
right?
If he keeps this up close to you.

41
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,140
Sure,
yeah,

42
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,970
yeah.
Pull it.

43
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:42,870
We,
uh,

44
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,440
there's all sorts of disasters that 
could happen to us that we don't really 

45
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,460
plan for because human lifetimes,
a hundred years.

46
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,460
Technology is a few hundred years,
but maybe there are disasters that 

47
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,110
happen every thousand or 10,000
years and they could be very bad.

48
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:03,111
I think solar flares are the one to 
really worry about it because that what 

49
00:02:03,111 --> 00:02:05,990
you you're concerned with,
it's not my pressure professional 

50
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,541
concern,
but I was once sitting next to a hot 

51
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:11,271
shot lawyer who had just been finished a
visiting Washington DC to campaign for.

52
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:16,491
We got to start hardening up the 
electrical grid because one kind of 

53
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:21,651
solar flare that he says happens every 
thousand years could wipe out 

54
00:02:21,651 --> 00:02:24,330
electricity in the United States or the 
world for weeks or months.

55
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,700
Millions of people would die,
right?

56
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,150
So a few billion dollars and we can 
harden it and fix things,

57
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,420
but who's going to spend a few billion 
dollars for something that happens once 

58
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:35,420
every thousand years?
Isn't that the issue?

59
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,741
It's like even with preventing asteroids
or doing something to avoid collisions.

60
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,180
It's right now we don't have an issue,
so we have other things to worry about.

61
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,450
We have a terrible president.
We have a global warming.

62
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:49,410
We have this,
we have that.

63
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,280
There's always something that keeps us 
from being rational about the future.

64
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,030
Yeah,
that's right.

65
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:59,060
And with the good news with asteroids is
that there's other good reasons to look 

66
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,380
at this guy and map things.
Right.

67
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:04,381
So the what astronomers are doing are 
piggybacking asteroid mapping strategies

68
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:08,440
off of things they can actually get 
money for it.

69
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:09,130
Right?
Because yeah,

70
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:12,100
no one is going to pony up that much 
money to look at the asteroid.

71
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,060
Why would think that that would be like 
a really good use of money?

72
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,540
Like let's,
let's keep an eye on the rocks that 

73
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,671
might kill everything you would think 
that everyone would say for their 

74
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:23,671
retirement and so forth.
Right.

75
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:26,020
This avilia planning for the future,
not what we have all four.

76
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,460
Well that's a big ability.

77
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,380
I mean that's a big plan for the future 
that,

78
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:34,381
I mean literally you're talking about 
like it wasn't there one that just whiz 

79
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,350
by that was three miles wide.
Yeah.

80
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:37,750
But was by means.
It was something like eight times as far

81
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,250
away as the moon.
Was that what it was?

82
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:40,180
Yeah.
This is not.

83
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,350
There's the chances of an asteroid even 
will be very bad.

84
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:47,980
The chances of a bad one or are much 
smaller than some of these other thing.

85
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,360
You don't come from me.
Alright.

86
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,120
For Comfort,
I hear the truth is I take the comfort 

87
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,381
as you will,
but isn't there like there's a lot of 

88
00:03:58,381 --> 00:03:58,420
areas they can come from like behind the
sun where the,

89
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:01,870
the gravity of the sun sort of distorts 
the view.

90
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,420
Not really high.
They got to orbit,

91
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:06,330
right?
They can't stay behind the sun.

92
00:04:06,331 --> 00:04:06,850
They.
Sorry.

93
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:07,390
They can.

94
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,400
There are,
there's what's called the garage point.

95
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:13,570
There's a place exactly the opposite 
where the earth is going to have to hang

96
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:18,571
out.
If you were to be hidden from us for a 

97
00:04:18,571 --> 00:04:20,890
long time and you can hang out there but
you would never leave there.

98
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:23,710
So there probably are some asteroids 
right opposite the earth,

99
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:26,500
just like most planets have them.
So they're just sort of orbiting.

100
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:27,190
So what you're saying,
yeah,

101
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:32,191
they're opening once a year,
a 180 degrees away from the earth and 

102
00:04:32,191 --> 00:04:32,810
that's what they will be doing until 
they are possible.

103
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,380
That one can come up and hit us from the
bottom.

104
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:36,370
And we're not looking.
No,

105
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:37,360
it's not.
No Way.

106
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,490
How's that?
Now,

107
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:44,491
part of the danger is something from far
outside the distance holders that we 

108
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:48,721
just haven't just too far away to dim 
and it wouldn't come from like in where 

109
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,260
the South Pole is very roughly speaking.

110
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,110
We're looking at the whole sky,
not just a,

111
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:58,140
you know,
you can see below the South Pole if 

112
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:58,140
you're in Chile,
for example,

113
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,620
with lots and lots of telescopes.
That's where they have that.

114
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:04,650
What is the,
the giant one that they put in Chile 

115
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,380
recently that's not totally operational.
Uh,

116
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:05,870
yeah,
there's,

117
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,990
there's a whole generation of 
telescopes.

118
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:09,760
I forget which one it is that's there 
yet,

119
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:12,160
but one of them is it the giant Magellan
telescope?

120
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:16,270
Maybe essential one.
I think they're just still working on it

121
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:20,590
now and Chili's because it's because 
it's a high altitude and the environment

122
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:22,680
is very flat and dry.
Yeah.

123
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,080
So I'm a Hawaii,
he's not a good place to put telescopes,

124
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:31,081
but that's gotten in trouble with a 
local resistance and astronomer is just 

125
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,630
not even trying to take that into 
consideration and therefore getting 

126
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,480
themselves in trouble.
Canary Islands are okay.

127
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,350
But uh,
yeah,

128
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:39,490
two ladies,
one of the best places,

129
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:40,420
Chilean Antarctica.

130
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,920
Actually,
I've been to the Keck observatory couple

131
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,940
times.
I've been three times and every time I 

132
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,971
go,
the first time I nailed it and every 

133
00:05:50,971 --> 00:05:50,980
time I've been since then I haven't 
gotten like,

134
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,550
one time we went and I didn't plan for 
the moon and I was like,

135
00:05:54,551 --> 00:05:55,810
oh,
there's too much moon out.

136
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,230
And it was,
it wasn't,

137
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,030
it was just too bright.
This guy was too bright.

138
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:02,440
And then the next time unfortunately we 
got it when it was raining,

139
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,430
kind of cloudy.
We didn't get a good vision,

140
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:07,220
but the first time,
first time changed my life.

141
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:12,460
I mean,
I've really felt like I was on a 

142
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:12,540
spaceship looking through a window,
you know,

143
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,080
what they were observing,
I don't know,

144
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:16,910
but we were actually just at the visitor
center,

145
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,530
just looking at the visitor center to 
the sky is so magnificent at night,

146
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,940
you know,
there's no light pollution.

147
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,500
They use diffused lighting on the 
island,

148
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:25,160
you know,
the whole deal.

149
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,710
And um,
the,

150
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:29,290
the image that you got from just looking
up,

151
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,650
I mean,
just with the naked eye,

152
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:35,651
it's just spectacular.
It's just an amazing view of the Milky 

153
00:06:35,651 --> 00:06:35,651
Way,
the telescope through there,

154
00:06:35,651 --> 00:06:35,651
right?
Yeah,

155
00:06:35,651 --> 00:06:40,530
I think so,
but it gives you a perspective that I 

156
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,131
think I think we're missing with our 
cities and I think we've done something 

157
00:06:42,131 --> 00:06:43,300
amazing by creating these cities were,
wow,

158
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:48,310
you know,
you just walk down the street and get 

159
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:48,310
some food delivered,
you know,

160
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:48,310
you can go get a car,
you can,

161
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:48,800
you know,
go buy a TV.

162
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:51,050
There's all this stuff and these 
congested areas.

163
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:53,510
But in putting all this artificial 
light,

164
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:57,260
we've removed our connection with the 
view of the cosmos.

165
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,350
It's absolutely true.
And I'm,

166
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,290
I'm the biggest booster of cities.
I love cities.

167
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,100
I love living in them.

168
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,270
I think that they're good for the 
planet,

169
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:03,680
et Cetera.
But uh,

170
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:05,360
yeah,
it does exactly like you said,

171
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:08,720
it sort of makes our environment so 
artificial that we forget.

172
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:14,260
Uh,
I remember a great story a friend of 

173
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:14,990
mine told me she worked for an 
organization called project exploration,

174
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:20,050
which is based in Chicago.
They were devoted to bringing the 

175
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:20,720
wonders of science to kids and 
minorities and so forth,

176
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:26,110
and they do these trips from Chicago on 
the train out to Montana to dig up 

177
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:27,410
dinosaur bones.
Right.

178
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,660
And so they are out there.
They get to go on a ranch,

179
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:31,790
they get to dig up real fossils,
bring them back,

180
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:36,850
and she said the thing that got them the
most that was most effective to them was

181
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:39,440
they saw stars for the first time in 
their lives.

182
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:40,760
Right?
They'd grown up in Chicago,

183
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:43,190
they'd never seen a star in the sky.

184
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,480
And I think that's a shame.
Yeah.

185
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:48,800
You see these faint little flickering 
things you don't see like a full.

186
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:54,270
The view of the Milky Way where you 
actually look up and you see that white 

187
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,220
sort of stripe across the sky and you 
realize,

188
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:56,210
oh my God,
that star.

189
00:07:56,211 --> 00:07:58,250
So those are all stars.
The Milky Way is the best.

190
00:07:58,251 --> 00:07:59,790
I get dizzy looking at it.
Right?

191
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,710
Knowing that we're at the edge of this 
spinning disk whirling around,

192
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:05,630
uh,
and if you don't get vertigo,

193
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,550
you're not doing it right.
Yeah.

194
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,740
As a person who studies space,
do you ever take time to like go out 

195
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,600
into the desert and just to stare at the
space with nothing out there?

196
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,640
No light pollution that much,
you know,

197
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:19,550
honestly,
the thing that I study are equations and

198
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:24,551
formulas and theories and I use space.
My friends who are observers go out 

199
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:29,291
there and collect the data and figure 
out what ideas we have are right and 

200
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:29,291
which ones are wrong.

201
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:34,060
And I'd love it when I get the chance,
but I don't go out of my way anymore 

202
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:34,060
than anybody else.
Um,

203
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,970
you were saying that people were asking 
about general relativity.

204
00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:38,750
Was that the,
uh,

205
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:41,580
the quantum and quantum mechanics people
on twitter say,

206
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,250
all right,
I hope to figure out quantum mechanics,

207
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:45,740
but the first time here they look up to 
you for this.

208
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,800
Yeah.
Well the problem is not impossible.

209
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,880
I don't think I'm just joking,
but what?

210
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:54,881
I'm very touchy,
but it's one of those things where 

211
00:08:54,881 --> 00:08:58,670
everyone is hoping that someone is going
to be able to boil it down and simple.

212
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,070
And Neil degrasse Tyson does a very good
job of doing that with the cosmos.

213
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:07,250
He's been able to boil down quite a few 
things on this show where a lot of 

214
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:07,250
people went,
thanks man.

215
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,320
Finally I kind of get it sorta yet.

216
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,790
He's fantastic.
He has an amazing ability,

217
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:12,840
especially off the cuff.
He.

218
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:14,290
Well,
it seems like off the cuff I,

219
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:19,300
I had this vision that he goes home 
every night and plans out answers to 

220
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,851
every possible question because there so
slick when he delivers that does a 

221
00:09:22,851 --> 00:09:25,731
little.
Because I've heard him give the exact 

222
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:25,890
same semi off the cuff,
but they're great.

223
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:28,830
So it sounds like it's like a stand up 
comedian delivering a line.

224
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,980
It's new to you.
Yeah,

225
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,140
that's right.
Yeah.

226
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,260
So what is it about it that they don't 
understand?

227
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:36,210
You think quantum mechanics?
Uh,

228
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:39,870
I think that's the subject of the next 
book that I'm writing a book I'm working

229
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,090
on right now.
So just starting thinking about it,

230
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:44,580
but it's not just the people on the 
street,

231
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:49,610
it's my professional colleagues with 
phds in physics who don't understand 

232
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:53,451
quantum mechanics.
And rather than being embarrassed by 

233
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:53,451
that,
you know,

234
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:54,150
rather than thinking,
wow,

235
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:59,151
this is a terrible thing that we should 
devote all our resources to 

236
00:09:59,151 --> 00:09:59,550
understanding,
they flip it,

237
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,910
they,
it's like a aesop's Fox and the grapes,

238
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,940
you know,
the parable where the Fox is trying to 

239
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:07,940
get the grapes and you realize that he 
can't reach,

240
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:07,940
reach them.

241
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,520
So he says,
I never wanted them anyway.

242
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:09,480
They're probably sour.
Right?

243
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,030
So that's a physicist.
Or like with quantum mechanics,

244
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:14,910
like now if you try to understand it at 
a deep level,

245
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,620
they disrespect you.
You're like,

246
00:10:16,621 --> 00:10:21,621
why are you wasting your time doing that
when we could be calculating some 

247
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:21,621
numbers?
Right.

248
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,430
Ego and knowledge.
It's always a weird combination.

249
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,360
I would always,
always.

250
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,400
I've always assumed when I was younger 
that well,

251
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:31,401
when you get to the highest levels of 
science or any sort of intellectual 

252
00:10:31,401 --> 00:10:33,990
pursuit that the people that are really 
involved,

253
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,360
there wouldn't be any ego issues.
It would all,

254
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,110
you know,
as an outsider,

255
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:42,390
I was like,
well there's ego and every other part of

256
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:47,391
the world.
But those super smart dudes that are 

257
00:10:47,391 --> 00:10:47,391
figuring everything out,
they got all that stuff locked down.

258
00:10:47,391 --> 00:10:48,580
Kind of the opposite of that.
Really,

259
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,190
really,
I love them.

260
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,390
These are my people,
you know,

261
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:52,440
and uh,
but,

262
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:53,850
but it's,
it's.

263
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,910
Well,
I'll explain quantum mechanics 

264
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:58,910
eventually,
but please.

265
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:58,980
But you are right.
I mean the,

266
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,450
I mean,
sorry,

267
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,490
the,
this ego thing.

268
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:07,550
I'm the.
One of the thing about academia being a 

269
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:07,550
professor,
right?

270
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:12,141
Whether it's science or anything else,
is that you are constantly being 

271
00:11:12,141 --> 00:11:13,170
evaluated by every other person you 
meet.

272
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:14,490
There's a hierarchy,
there's a rank,

273
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:16,050
how good you are at everything,
right?

274
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,440
And it's not written down necessarily.
There's not a rankings that appeared in 

275
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,310
the sports pages,
but everyone is judging you all the time

276
00:11:23,311 --> 00:11:24,840
and you know,
my students and so forth,

277
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:25,470
they say,
well,

278
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,740
I don't like to ask questions in a 
seminar because I worry that someone's 

279
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,410
going to be judging me.
And all I can say is that yes,

280
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:34,320
they are going to be judging you at the 
very,

281
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:35,010
very,
very,

282
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:35,970
very tippy top.

283
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,420
Am I number two or number three?
Right?

284
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,650
And it's.
Yeah,

285
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,850
it's very sad and it's not,
not everyone's like that,

286
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:46,851
but a lot,
most people in the field get to be like 

287
00:11:46,851 --> 00:11:50,250
that and probably it helps forward the 
advance of science.

288
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,720
Right?
The competitive nature of it.

289
00:11:51,721 --> 00:11:56,721
It's competitive and egotistical and 
they want to do better than everybody 

290
00:11:56,721 --> 00:11:59,101
else and prove that they're better and 
and I'm sure Einstein and Newton where 

291
00:11:59,101 --> 00:12:00,160
justice driven by that is that anybody 
else?

292
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:05,430
Isn't it weird?
It seems like human beings need that 

293
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,850
comparative sort of competition thing 
going on in order to afford whatever 

294
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:11,710
they're doing.
They need peers.

295
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:14,380
They need some sort of.
It helps it's there.

296
00:12:14,381 --> 00:12:19,381
Yeah.
And we live in a world with scarce 

297
00:12:19,381 --> 00:12:19,381
resources,
right?

298
00:12:19,381 --> 00:12:19,450
Some of us are going to live longer than
others.

299
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:21,430
Some of us are going to get tenure and 
some of us are not.

300
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,830
Some of us are gonna be Nobel Prize 
winners and some are not.

301
00:12:23,831 --> 00:12:26,350
So no matter what,
there's going to be competition.

302
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,370
Yeah.
Yeah.

303
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:31,630
And in your,
in your field is there is a big issue,

304
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:36,631
I guess with people disregarding other 
people's discoveries or wanting to 

305
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:41,701
rather like saying like wanting to 
poopoo things and I think this a very 

306
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:47,161
complicated issue that I don't really 
have clear because certainly scientists 

307
00:12:47,161 --> 00:12:51,001
can be very,
very supportive of each other under the 

308
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:51,001
right circumstances.
Uh,

309
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:52,230
but there are,
there human beings,

310
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:57,040
there's all sorts of cognitive biases 
that they have prejudices,

311
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,650
basie and priors for what's likely to be
true,

312
00:12:59,651 --> 00:13:03,790
what's not likely to be true.
And it's not just perfect reasoning,

313
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,140
perfect rationality,
right?

314
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:10,141
People come in with their prejudices and
if you go and tickle their a 

315
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,130
preconceived notions,
they'll think you're great.

316
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:17,310
And if you say something that doesn't 
quite fit into what they're thinking 

317
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:17,310
about them,
they'll sort of look somewhere else.

318
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:17,920
Your ministry,
do you,

319
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:19,270
um,
do you teach this?

320
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:24,330
When you're teaching classes and you're,
you're addressing potential future 

321
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:30,180
cosmologists and quantum mechanics,
quantum mechanics now committed.

322
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,390
There's no person who does quantum 
physicist as good.

323
00:13:34,391 --> 00:13:35,230
Yeah.
What do you,

324
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,880
do you tell them about the potential 
pitfalls?

325
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,450
Maybe plant a seed in their head like,
hey,

326
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:42,340
you can avoid this.
You can still be competitive,

327
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,640
but avoid all these traps that are 
essentially like these intellectual 

328
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,020
rabbit hole you can go down that are 
really not beneficial to anybody.

329
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:55,050
Yeah,
I mean if I'm formally teaching class 

330
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:55,050
and I'm standing up there in front of a 
lecture hall,

331
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,360
a 98 percent is teaching the material 
pretty straightforwardly.

332
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:02,370
I try to dribble in little words of 
wisdom here and there and especially if 

333
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:05,551
I think that there is a way that we 
always teach the subject that is wrong 

334
00:14:05,551 --> 00:14:06,820
and wrongheaded and we should be doing 
it right.

335
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,820
I tried to highlight the differences,
but if I'm advising students like my 

336
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,360
graduate students or my undergraduates,
then I,

337
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:15,310
you know,
lay on very hard the,

338
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:20,470
uh,
my own perspective on how it is to be a 

339
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,670
scientist and what is the good way to do
and what's the bad way to do it.

340
00:14:21,671 --> 00:14:23,050
What are the pitfalls?
And also just,

341
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:28,051
you know,
how to not make mistakes and trip up 

342
00:14:28,051 --> 00:14:28,051
your own career.
Yeah.

343
00:14:28,051 --> 00:14:29,020
That's critically important.
Now,

344
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:33,760
what is it about quantum mechanics that 
you think people don't understand?

345
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,550
Well,
yeah.

346
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,620
Everyone agrees on what we don't 
understand this the thing that makes 

347
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,351
quantum mechanics,
which is our single best theory of the 

348
00:14:43,351 --> 00:14:46,501
universe in some sense,
the thing that makes it difficult to 

349
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:47,170
understand is that as the only theory 
you've ever invented,

350
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,680
where there is a difference between what
the world is

351
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,230
and what we see.
When we look at the world,

352
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,360
right?
In every other theory,

353
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:59,780
if we look closely enough,
we would see the world as it is,

354
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:04,781
and quantum mechanics has this 
fundamental rule that says you can't see

355
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:07,940
the world as it is you.
If you have an electron,

356
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:12,941
right,
a particle that can be spinning 

357
00:15:12,941 --> 00:15:13,160
clockwise or counterclockwise,
you think that's what can happen,

358
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:14,540
because every time you look at it and 
you say,

359
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,000
is it spinning clockwise or spinning 
counterclockwise?

360
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:20,370
You get one answer or the other,
but the rules of quantum mechanics,

361
00:15:20,371 --> 00:15:22,550
I,
when you're not looking at it,

362
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:27,940
it's in a super position of both and you
can calculate the probability that 

363
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,811
you're going to get one answer or the 
other and this drives people crazy 

364
00:15:31,811 --> 00:15:36,431
because they think that what they see is
what is real and therefore they have 

365
00:15:36,431 --> 00:15:37,730
very,
very difficult times figuring out how to

366
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:42,731
make a sensible theory of quantum 
mechanics that explains what you 

367
00:15:42,731 --> 00:15:42,731
actually see.

368
00:15:42,731 --> 00:15:43,620
Yeah.
Even you just explaining that.

369
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,720
I'm circling around and signed my brain.
I'm looking for like a Cabi to put place

370
00:15:48,811 --> 00:15:50,400
this.
Where does this go?

371
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,860
Superposition.
What was he saying?

372
00:15:52,861 --> 00:15:57,861
He's saying that it's in two different 
places at the same time or that it's 

373
00:15:57,861 --> 00:15:59,100
still an emotion at the same time.
Good.

374
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,180
Right,
so that's right.

375
00:16:00,181 --> 00:16:03,580
So exactly what you're doing right now.
You're saying that you know,

376
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,830
there are things that it can be still in
motion,

377
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:11,890
this place,
that place and somehow it's in both at 

378
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,430
once or something like that.
And with quantum mechanics says it's not

379
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:18,431
an either.
Like if you ask where's the position of 

380
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,130
the electron,
there's no such thing as the position of

381
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:21,800
the electron.
If you look at the electron,

382
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:26,801
you will see it in a position,
but that is not the fundamental essence 

383
00:16:26,801 --> 00:16:30,791
of the electron.
There's something called the quantum 

384
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,771
state where the wave function,
there's a mathematical way that we have 

385
00:16:32,771 --> 00:16:36,190
representing the reality of it,
but the answers that gives us two 

386
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,220
questions are just not here.
It is.

387
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,440
There has how fast it's moving,
et cetera.

388
00:16:39,441 --> 00:16:42,950
That's not what we calculate using the 
theory.

389
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,630
Does this,
is this sort of.

390
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,940
I mean it's very bizarre.
Right?

391
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:52,941
And it's very complex.
And is this sort of lend itself to get 

392
00:16:52,941 --> 00:16:54,510
hijacked by Woo folks?
Oh totally.

393
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,660
Which is why like what the bleep,
like the what the bleep do we know?

394
00:16:57,661 --> 00:17:02,661
That was when I first started really 
paying attention to this stuff and then 

395
00:17:02,661 --> 00:17:06,650
I was reading criticisms of what the 
bleep and that's when I got an 

396
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:06,650
understanding like,
oh,

397
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,881
okay,
well this is kind of horseshit and this 

398
00:17:10,881 --> 00:17:10,881
lady is kind of a channeler.
Yeah,

399
00:17:10,881 --> 00:17:11,820
like what?
In a kind of a cult,

400
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,280
sort of a deal.
What?

401
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:18,650
Wait a minute.
Like when she was saying her name was 

402
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:18,650
ramp though,
it was like that's her real name.

403
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,070
Ten thousand year old warriors,
you know that.

404
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,600
How come they didn't put that in the 
movie?

405
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,730
Like the.
There's a lady in the movie,

406
00:17:23,731 --> 00:17:28,731
if you've seen what and so many people 
are in my God that changed my life and 

407
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:32,690
we were training because all of a sudden
they thought that like magic was real 

408
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,060
and it is kind of right.
I mean it's something magic,

409
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,560
but magic.
The world is not magic,

410
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:40,860
but when you look at an atom and realize
that most of it is space,

411
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:45,861
like most of the things that we're 
looking at are mostly space and that 

412
00:17:45,861 --> 00:17:48,990
subatomic particles really do kind of 
blink in and out of existence.

413
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:54,590
You look at all the various quantum 
weirdness that is real and observable by

414
00:17:56,371 --> 00:17:58,320
people like you that actually studied 
this stuff.

415
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,300
It looks crazy.

416
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,220
Yeah.
In fact,

417
00:18:01,221 --> 00:18:05,000
so I hate to be that guy,
but both the claim that atoms are mostly

418
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:10,001
space and the claim,
the particles pumping out of existence 

419
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:10,001
are both entirely bullshit.
Oh,

420
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:14,081
please educate me more.
Why do people say that all the time 

421
00:18:14,081 --> 00:18:17,441
then?
Because they are privileging what you 

422
00:18:17,441 --> 00:18:20,441
see when you look right.
Privileging like white privilege or 

423
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:20,441
different.
Exactly like that.

424
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:23,180
Know they're there.
They have a view of what should be.

425
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:28,210
Okay,
and so if you have an electron in an 

426
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,770
atom,
we have a mathematical way of describing

427
00:18:30,771 --> 00:18:33,500
it and it's a cloud.
It's not located anywhere.

428
00:18:33,501 --> 00:18:38,501
It's not empty space and here's the 
electron and most of the rest of it's 

429
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:39,050
empty.
It's not like a little miniature version

430
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,630
of the solar system.
The solar system is mostly empty.

431
00:18:41,631 --> 00:18:45,260
There's empty space in between the 
planets and if you draw a picture of the

432
00:18:45,261 --> 00:18:50,261
atom or look at one from your high 
school science book and Adam looks just 

433
00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:50,261
like the solar system,
right?

434
00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:51,080
Exactly.
Is at the center and these things moving

435
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:53,120
around it.
That's not what it is.

436
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:58,180
It's A.
It's a smooth cloud that is everywhere 

437
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,930
inside the atom and that cloud is the 
answer to the question where I do look 

438
00:19:02,691 --> 00:19:04,910
for the electron,
where would I most likely see it?

439
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,120
Okay,
and so the leap that is very,

440
00:19:08,121 --> 00:19:12,500
very hard to make is what the electron 
truly is,

441
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,230
is that cloud.
It's not what you see.

442
00:19:15,231 --> 00:19:16,880
You never see the cloud.
When you look at it,

443
00:19:16,881 --> 00:19:21,881
you see the electron position,
but what it is is that cloud and people 

444
00:19:21,881 --> 00:19:22,670
just can't.
And so that's what they talk about.

445
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,770
Particles popping in and out of 
existence.

446
00:19:24,771 --> 00:19:29,771
What there is is this wave function,
this probability cloud that tells you 

447
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,360
how likely is it,
you'll see a particle,

448
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,100
and if the answer is,
well,

449
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,320
it's very unlikely.
It's point zero,

450
00:19:36,321 --> 00:19:37,490
zero,
one percent chance.

451
00:19:37,491 --> 00:19:39,650
If I look here and look here again,
look here again.

452
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,320
Then when you do see it,
you're tempted to say,

453
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,750
Aha,
a particle has popped into existence.

454
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,720
The reality is there was the cloud that 
was there all along.

455
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:49,520
It was sitting there.
It was not fluctuating,

456
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,400
he was not changing,
but it's not what you see.

457
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:57,940
And everyone from Einstein on down has 
had a real tough time wrapping their 

458
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:57,940
heads around that.
Yeah,

459
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,610
I still don't get it.

460
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:01,960
So,
uh,

461
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:07,090
so when people say that an atom is 
mostly empty space,

462
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,120
it's not true.
It's mostly this wave function for the 

463
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,120
electron.
Yeah.

464
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,890
So there's this sort of very difficult 
to describe property to it yet.

465
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:22,590
And they were trying.
So we are we looking at things sort of 

466
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,150
in a very material sense,
like you know,

467
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,960
this mug is ceramic,
this table is wood,

468
00:20:25,961 --> 00:20:27,640
and we think about the composition of 
it.

469
00:20:27,641 --> 00:20:29,560
If we cut into the ceramic,
we know what it looks like.

470
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,470
So we're trying to apply those 
principles to like maybe an Adam.

471
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,040
Yeah,
exactly.

472
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,300
They just don't apply because it's the 
other way around.

473
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:41,301
Like we,
we think that our world that we see 

474
00:20:41,301 --> 00:20:43,851
every day is sort of basically how 
things work and we're going to sort of 

475
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:46,260
translate other extremes of existence 
into that language,

476
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:49,300
whether it's far or way back in time.
We're very,

477
00:20:49,301 --> 00:20:54,301
very small or whatever,
but there's no reason to think that our 

478
00:20:54,301 --> 00:20:57,961
everyday life experience has equipped us
with the vocabulary to talk about these 

479
00:20:57,961 --> 00:21:00,130
things in any sensible way and in fact 
it hasn't,

480
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,080
so we have a very completely viable way 
of talking about the atom.

481
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:10,110
We have very,
very rigorous mathematical ways of 

482
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:13,351
describing what happens and then quantum
mechanics says what you see when you 

483
00:21:13,351 --> 00:21:17,341
look at the Adam is different and we 
just sit there and insist that what we 

484
00:21:17,341 --> 00:21:21,181
see is the real way to talk about it.
No matter how anti quantum mechanical 

485
00:21:21,181 --> 00:21:21,520
that viewpoint really is.

486
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,660
That's got to be incredibly frustrating 
to you because I've heard like 

487
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,821
legitimate mainstream scientists on 
television talking about the Adam and 

488
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:29,821
describing it in that way.
Oh yeah.

489
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,910
Oh yeah.
I know.

490
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,560
Believe me,
and this is to be,

491
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:37,060
to be super fair.
People disagree.

492
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:42,330
Okay.
So I think that people disagree about 

493
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,511
what the fundamental nature of quantum 
mechanics is and I have no problem with 

494
00:21:45,511 --> 00:21:45,760
that.
I mean,

495
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:50,761
I have a point of view and I actually 
believe in the many worlds 

496
00:21:50,761 --> 00:21:53,551
interpretation of quantum mechanics and 
we can explain that and I think it was 

497
00:21:53,551 --> 00:21:54,280
perfectly sensible and coherent and fits
together.

498
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,550
Uh,
but if you have another point of view on

499
00:21:57,551 --> 00:22:00,580
quantum mechanics that is also perfectly
sensible and coherent fits together,

500
00:22:00,581 --> 00:22:05,581
that's fine.
We can disagree and we can ask about 

501
00:22:05,581 --> 00:22:06,970
what experiments to do.
The sad thing is that most physicists,

502
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,460
especially ones that go on tv and talk 
about this stuff,

503
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:14,730
just don't think about it that hard and 
therefore they're sloppy when they talk 

504
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,430
about it and therefore people come away 
going,

505
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,360
oh,
I don't really get it.

506
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,600
It's very gettable.
It's totally understandable.

507
00:22:19,601 --> 00:22:24,601
Again,
we can disagree about what the 

508
00:22:24,601 --> 00:22:25,030
understanding will ultimately be,
but physicists contribute just as much,

509
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,410
you know,
not on purpose,

510
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:27,790
but they,
they allow,

511
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:32,791
they opened up the space for what the 
bleep do we know people to insert their 

512
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:37,261
woo in there because they're not doing a
very good job of measuring up to the 

513
00:22:37,261 --> 00:22:37,960
reality themselves.
So it's,

514
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:43,020
it seems like it's something that's 
intensely complex that almost needs to 

515
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,891
be described with mathematics,
which would require you to have a deep 

516
00:22:46,891 --> 00:22:48,160
understanding of mathematics to really 
completely grasp.

517
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:50,680
Is that a fair assessment until my book 
comes out?

518
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:52,840
Yeah,
that's what it is.

519
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,400
What is the book?
Oh,

520
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:59,670
well,
so the title of the book is something 

521
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,531
deeply hidden.
This is a phrase from Einstein and the 

522
00:23:01,531 --> 00:23:04,351
idea is that there is something real 
that we can get a handle on is just 

523
00:23:04,351 --> 00:23:08,071
different than what we see and I,
I don't think that we need the 

524
00:23:08,071 --> 00:23:09,670
mathematical details to get it right.

525
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:14,670
What we need is to have the willingness 
to let go of our intuition a little bit 

526
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:14,910
to,
to,

527
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:20,100
to accept the idea that the way the 
world works at a fundamental level is 

528
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,991
very different than the typical ideas 
about space and time and stuff that we 

529
00:23:24,991 --> 00:23:27,010
are born with.
Where were you when that,

530
00:23:27,011 --> 00:23:29,560
what the bleep moving was out where you 
were a professor yet?

531
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,630
Uh,
I think so.

532
00:23:31,631 --> 00:23:36,631
I,
I lost a perspective girlfriend over 

533
00:23:36,631 --> 00:23:38,341
that movie,
like we met and we went on a date and 

534
00:23:38,341 --> 00:23:42,451
she's like,
I got the best movie for you to say I 

535
00:23:42,451 --> 00:23:42,451
don't think I'm gonna like it.
And she says,

536
00:23:42,451 --> 00:23:43,480
well,
you got to be open minded gotta.

537
00:23:43,481 --> 00:23:44,880
At least watch it.
I watched it.

538
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,430
I was like,
oh my goodness.

539
00:23:46,431 --> 00:23:48,780
Did you try to explain to her that it's 
not true?

540
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,990
But there was,
it was not a close call.

541
00:23:50,991 --> 00:23:51,860
It was not like,
Oh,

542
00:23:51,861 --> 00:23:53,580
if I explained this,
she'll get it.

543
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,100
Is Love this movie

544
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,390
important.
Right.

545
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,420
And I have a friend.
It was a really sad story.

546
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:04,660
Um,
I have a friend who was really into the 

547
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:08,081
secret and uh,
she was actually a friend of a friend 

548
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:12,370
more than a friend and um,
I ran into her at the comedy store and 

549
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:16,541
we were talking and she was explaining 
to me how she has sort of use the power 

550
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:21,470
of the secret to map out her life.
And it was all gonna take place.

551
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,150
Right.
And I didn't see her again for like,

552
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,140
like a year or so later,
maybe more.

553
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,720
And then the next time I saw her,
she was like,

554
00:24:29,721 --> 00:24:31,520
I don't understand,
you know,

555
00:24:31,521 --> 00:24:36,521
I,
I really thought this was going to work 

556
00:24:36,521 --> 00:24:38,680
and my life is still a mess and my dad 
is a loser and every guy date is a piece

557
00:24:38,691 --> 00:24:39,670
of shit.
And it was just like,

558
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,420
yeah.
And she just couldn't,

559
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,820
she couldn't get it right.

560
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,700
And she was convinced that this law of 
attraction,

561
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,280
which in my eyes is very similar and a 
lot of ways,

562
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:51,260
like the,
the idea behind it is,

563
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,880
look,
you're taking a bunch of people that are

564
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:55,400
extremely successful and you're asking 
them how'd you do it?

565
00:24:55,401 --> 00:24:55,850
And they're like,
well,

566
00:24:55,851 --> 00:24:58,340
I visualize it.
Holy Shit has got to be the answer.

567
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:58,700
Right.
No,

568
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,720
that's,
that's one part of a giant thing that 

569
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:03,720
makes someone successful.
Yeah.

570
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,151
And luck.
Is it even bigger for a lot going on 

571
00:25:08,151 --> 00:25:08,151
there?
Yeah.

572
00:25:08,151 --> 00:25:10,811
Like did you imagine that you were born 
with two legs because some people 

573
00:25:10,811 --> 00:25:10,811
aren't,
right?

574
00:25:10,811 --> 00:25:14,600
Yeah.
So when you deal with something like the

575
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:17,510
secret or something like that,
you know,

576
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,190
the,
uh,

577
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,220
the rabbit hole,
well,

578
00:25:19,221 --> 00:25:24,221
you know what the bleep,
there's this desire that people have to 

579
00:25:24,221 --> 00:25:27,770
find like some secret message,
like there's,

580
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:33,030
there's a,
a magical quality to the world and all 

581
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:36,391
you have to do is think about it and 
look about it in a certain way and your 

582
00:25:36,391 --> 00:25:36,391
life will take on this incredible 
quality.

583
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:36,650
Right?

584
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,140
Yep.
And I think that,

585
00:25:38,141 --> 00:25:39,380
uh,
it's.

586
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,340
So my last book,
the big picture I actually devoted,

587
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:47,341
even though it was mostly about physics 
and philosophy and cosmology and 

588
00:25:47,341 --> 00:25:50,551
biology,
I devoted a little bit to the 

589
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:51,730
fundamental principles of reasoning and 
especially basie and reasoning.

590
00:25:51,731 --> 00:25:53,440
I don't know if you've ever heard of 
basie and reasoning.

591
00:25:53,441 --> 00:25:54,670
I have.
What would you describe it?

592
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,690
Sure.
I mean it's,

593
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:59,400
it's basically the,
the essence of it is the following idea.

594
00:25:59,401 --> 00:26:02,380
Someone tells you a good idea or do you 
come up with a good idea yourself?

595
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,560
The usual thing that people will do is 
either say,

596
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,360
that sounds right,
it's true,

597
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:09,430
or that sounds wrong.
It's false.

598
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:14,020
And what Phase II and reasoning says no 
to every possibility you say,

599
00:26:14,021 --> 00:26:15,640
okay,
maybe it's true.

600
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:20,730
Maybe it's false.
I will assign a probability to it being 

601
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:21,430
true or false.
It's called that the prior probability.

602
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,380
And then I will go collect data.
I will say,

603
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:25,690
well,
what will the world be like if this were

604
00:26:25,691 --> 00:26:27,250
true?
And then we'll go look right?

605
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,660
Does this a woman over here like me?
And she romantically attracted to me?

606
00:26:31,661 --> 00:26:35,110
Well maybe that would affect what she 
says.

607
00:26:35,111 --> 00:26:37,390
If I say hi to her and therefore I'm 
going to do the experiment.

608
00:26:37,391 --> 00:26:42,391
Right?
And this is everything from going 

609
00:26:42,391 --> 00:26:42,391
through your everyday life to being a 
professional scientist.

610
00:26:42,391 --> 00:26:44,130
So look fine.
Read the secret.

611
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,680
Be told that there's this law of 
attraction.

612
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:49,920
If you understand how physics works,
you know that it's completely nonsense.

613
00:26:49,921 --> 00:26:53,340
But if you were tempted to believe it,
say to yourself,

614
00:26:53,341 --> 00:26:54,590
alright,
let me test it.

615
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:59,750
Let me figure out what,
whether it's true or false by saying if 

616
00:26:59,750 --> 00:26:59,850
it were true with the following,
things would happen.

617
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:01,530
If it were false,
the following things would happen.

618
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:05,400
And that I think that everyone thinks 
they work that way,

619
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:07,880
but almost no one really does.
Yeah.

620
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,960
It's very difficult.
We have these preconceived notions that 

621
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:12,960
we really like to clean code.
Yeah.

622
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,450
We really like to imagine that we're 
right about things we hate to be wrong.

623
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,840
And if you.
Once you were on a path like I believe 

624
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,300
in this,
it's super hard for people to shake that

625
00:27:21,301 --> 00:27:26,301
loose and people generally think that 
the probability that something is true 

626
00:27:26,301 --> 00:27:29,001
is either zero or 100 percent.
You don't like the idea that there's 

627
00:27:29,001 --> 00:27:32,721
something as 70 percent true and 
therefore they can sort of improve that 

628
00:27:32,721 --> 00:27:34,200
or deep or,
or disprove that or whatever.

629
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:39,350
It's just a,
it's just hard going through life 

630
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,500
thinking about probability distributions
for every possible version of reality.

631
00:27:40,501 --> 00:27:44,940
But that is the best way to do it if you
can probability distributions.

632
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,940
Yeah.
Is that what you do when you walked on 

633
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:49,940
the street?
Oh yeah,

634
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,120
totally.
I long list of numbers in my head.

635
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,810
I mean the good news is you.
There is a certain threshold,

636
00:27:54,811 --> 00:27:59,811
right?
If something is 99 percent true or 99 

637
00:27:59,811 --> 00:27:59,811
percent,
99 point nine,

638
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,560
nine percent likely to be true,
get on with your life.

639
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,950
You just accept that as true and don't 
keep trying to come up.

640
00:28:04,951 --> 00:28:08,040
Come up with evidence for it against it,
unless it's forced itself on you.

641
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,780
Like a.
When people say that the universe is not

642
00:28:12,781 --> 00:28:14,640
really expanding my,
my field,

643
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:19,641
I get this right,
like we've had evidence since the 19 

644
00:28:19,641 --> 00:28:19,641
twenties.
The universe is expanding well,

645
00:28:19,641 --> 00:28:23,090
who says it's not everyone who emails me
every like I get emails and letters and 

646
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:28,911
they have their own theories and the 
light just got tired coming from these 

647
00:28:28,911 --> 00:28:29,820
other galaxies that gets tired.

648
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:33,210
There's literally something called the 
tired light theory like fatigue.

649
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,290
Yes,
exactly.

650
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,820
And I'm not,
you know,

651
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:42,410
so there's some version of the 
scientific method that says every idea 

652
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:46,401
should be treated seriously and you 
should sort of write down what the 

653
00:28:46,401 --> 00:28:47,070
evidence for and against this is.
But come on,

654
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,110
I've done that.
I know the universe is expanding.

655
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:50,700
I'm not going to waste my time.
That's okay.

656
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:55,710
That's why we can get through our 
everyday lives perfectly well without 

657
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:59,001
being very good Bayesians at all.
Have you had many flat earthers email 

658
00:28:59,001 --> 00:29:01,500
you?
I haven't had flat earthers email me.

659
00:29:01,501 --> 00:29:06,501
I did once tweet.
I had one tweet mentioning the phrase 

660
00:29:06,501 --> 00:29:09,090
flat earth and I did get an invitation 
to come on a podcast,

661
00:29:09,091 --> 00:29:11,400
a flat earth podcast.
They have a flatter with podcast.

662
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:13,000
I'm sure there's thousands,
but uh,

663
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:13,620
yeah,
they are.

664
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,780
They're out there.
Where are they going to try to school?

665
00:29:15,781 --> 00:29:16,370
You,
uh,

666
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:19,380
you know,
it was to their credit,

667
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,310
it was quite polite and you know,
we know you don't believe this,

668
00:29:23,311 --> 00:29:28,311
but let's come.
Come on and have a conversation and 

669
00:29:28,311 --> 00:29:31,071
we'll talk to you.
And we're just about questioning things 

670
00:29:31,071 --> 00:29:34,311
and getting at the truth and getting an 
education and actual astronomy or 

671
00:29:34,401 --> 00:29:38,760
astrophysicist that the crucial thing 
that you notice whenever you talk to the

672
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:41,070
many,
many physics and astronomy crackpots out

673
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,070
is that

674
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,250
they're never asking questions.
They're always here.

675
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:46,930
I will tell you the truth if you want to
know it.

676
00:29:46,931 --> 00:29:48,820
They're never like helped me learn.
Right?

677
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,590
If people,
if people email me and say,

678
00:29:50,591 --> 00:29:55,591
help me learn that,
I'm usually very happy to converse with 

679
00:29:55,591 --> 00:29:55,591
them one way or the other.
Well,

680
00:29:55,591 --> 00:29:56,080
it's super easy to start questioning 
things,

681
00:29:56,081 --> 00:30:01,081
but it's very difficult to get a degree 
in astrophysics or to get a degree in 

682
00:30:01,081 --> 00:30:01,750
astronomy or to really read books about 
it.

683
00:30:01,751 --> 00:30:04,750
Like I getting through Lawrence Krause's
last book,

684
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,820
man.
There's chapters that I had to like go.

685
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:08,830
Okay,
let's go through this one more time.

686
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:12,490
Like when he came here I had to ask him 
like one of the first things we did,

687
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,280
it was probably a mistake because it's 
so complex.

688
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:17,980
I tried to get him to explain gauge 
symmetry to me.

689
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,760
Okay.
Yeah.

690
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:21,340
And it was just like he did it like two 
or three times.

691
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,800
I'm like,
okay,

692
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,940
there's certain parts about it that are 
really hard.

693
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:32,990
Yeah.
Whereas we can try that again if you 

694
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:32,990
want,
but it is.

695
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:32,990
There are hard things.
That's okay.

696
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,090
You would be surprised if there weren't.
Right.

697
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:39,091
Like if you spend 500 years learning 
about the universe and everything made 

698
00:30:39,091 --> 00:30:40,600
perfect sense the first time,
that would be kind of remarkable.

699
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,290
No,
yeah,

700
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:44,530
it's super complex and I,
I guess that makes sense.

701
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:49,560
It makes sense that it would be.
Now when someone boils it down to 

702
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:49,560
something that's really woo woo,
like,

703
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,130
you know,
what the bleep do we know,

704
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,620
how is that frustrating to you?
What does it mean?

705
00:30:55,630 --> 00:31:00,630
That must make you communicating with 
people that have seen that and have 

706
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,530
these ideas that are false assumptions 
based on it.

707
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,320
Sort of like I said to you that atoms 
are mostly hollow.

708
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,270
What does that frustrating?

709
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:12,270
I mean,
what does that line gets frustrating at 

710
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:12,270
different levels?
You know,

711
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:12,270
I think,
um,

712
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:16,770
I,
my first impulse is to be charmed and 

713
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:21,420
happy when people care,
people are even interested on a very 

714
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:21,420
positive.
Have you?

715
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,000
Uh,
yeah,

716
00:31:22,001 --> 00:31:26,380
like I first want to give people credit 
and see if there's something inside them

717
00:31:26,381 --> 00:31:29,080
with that we can work with and try to 
work toward the truth.

718
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,510
Right?
Um,

719
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:31,210
but then,
yeah,

720
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:36,220
so,
and I think most people maybe are like 

721
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,401
that and there's some hardcore people 
who have made up their minds about the 

722
00:31:38,401 --> 00:31:38,401
craziness.
I mean,

723
00:31:38,401 --> 00:31:38,980
you see where it would come from,
right?

724
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:43,981
Because quantum mechanics says what the 
world is is different than what we see 

725
00:31:43,981 --> 00:31:48,391
when we look at it.
So it's a small leap from that correct 

726
00:31:48,391 --> 00:31:50,230
statement to we bring the world into 
existence by looking at it.

727
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:55,260
Right.
Then you're deepak chopra and DM me on 

728
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:55,260
twitter.

729
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,980
So whenever I tweet something about 
quantum mechanics,

730
00:31:56,981 --> 00:32:00,160
he retweets it with something.
But it's all in your mind.

731
00:32:00,161 --> 00:32:02,170
It's all consciousness bringing the 
world into existence.

732
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,100
He loves word Salad.
Yeah.

733
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:09,180
That guy is the biggest like dealer of 
worlds word salad.

734
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,370
Yeah.
The world is ever changing.

735
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:15,790
This is putting them the word salad into
a recipe that people think is nutritious

736
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:16,300
for them.
Right.

737
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:19,930
They really liked to eat even though 
there's no actual nutritional value.

738
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,960
Well there's,
you get a lot of that from like certain 

739
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:24,960
yoga classes,
like there's certain yoga classes that I

740
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,090
go to where like the yoga teacher will 
start talking some woo woo shit and like

741
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,520
you're being in the middle of the pose.
And I'm like,

742
00:32:30,521 --> 00:32:33,400
what the fuck is this guy going on about
the.

743
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,650
I do it too.
And as long as the pose is helping me,

744
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,320
I'm going to put up with that smile my 
way through it,

745
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,010
debate them

746
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:45,010
right in the middle of it.
But it's weird that that stuff is all 

747
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:47,531
can sign up.
That's all sort of kind of in that sort 

748
00:32:47,531 --> 00:32:51,791
of genre of people that are trying to 
improve their life or be spiritual or 

749
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,140
they love that deep rock show up or 
shit.

750
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,150
Like I've had the,
I had this conversation with a friend of

751
00:32:56,151 --> 00:33:01,151
mine who's like,
it gave me a Deepak Chopra book and I 

752
00:33:01,151 --> 00:33:02,730
started going through it.
Now was like,

753
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:03,650
I go,
you know,

754
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:04,820
this guy's crazy,
right?

755
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:10,630
Probably wants to do well,
it's probably not a terrible person 

756
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:13,900
probably wants to do well.
But he's also ignoring the actual 

757
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,190
scientists that study all this stuff and
he,

758
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:20,220
he's sort of pitching this thing that 
what it is like this Deepak Chopra ism 

759
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:25,990
this sort of like spiritual pseudo 
spiritual view of the world that he's 

760
00:33:26,031 --> 00:33:27,380
pitching to like,
uh,

761
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,620
these,
these middle aged housewives.

762
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:33,470
They're like looking for some sort of 
meaning to life,

763
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:35,060
but they don't like going to church.
Yeah.

764
00:33:35,061 --> 00:33:36,350
And Daniel Dennett,
the philosopher,

765
00:33:36,351 --> 00:33:39,050
came up with a great word for it.
He calls them deep at ease.

766
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:43,190
When you string some words together in a
way that sounds extremely profound,

767
00:33:43,191 --> 00:33:48,191
but you look closely at it,
it doesn't actually mean anything at 

768
00:33:48,191 --> 00:33:50,531
all.
You know there's a website that will do 

769
00:33:50,531 --> 00:33:50,531
that for you.
How the Deepak Chopra quote general.

770
00:33:50,531 --> 00:33:51,330
That's it.
It's not that hard.

771
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:56,800
I would like to laugh at.
There's another website that comes up 

772
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:56,800
with brandon physics,
paper titles.

773
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,490
It's not that day.
Not that different.

774
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:01,700
Usually tell when it's a random visitor,
but the physics stuff is.

775
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:06,730
It's almost be I guess,
similar issues with the reason why deep 

776
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:11,580
bra can do that is because most people 
don't understand what he's talking 

777
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,831
about.
So if you say a lot of stuff about 

778
00:34:14,831 --> 00:34:14,831
things that people don't understand like
I've had,

779
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:15,090
we've.

780
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:20,140
There's been a bunch of videos that we 
played on this podcast about a fake 

781
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:24,430
martial arts practitioners.
There's a whole business and these 

782
00:34:25,281 --> 00:34:30,281
people that have these fake martial arts
techniques and they use all these huge 

783
00:34:30,281 --> 00:34:34,961
words that are rare,
very rare about the central nervous 

784
00:34:34,961 --> 00:34:35,210
system and about the,
you know,

785
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:40,010
the structure of the body and they'll,
they'll use all this stuff to try to get

786
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:40,730
you to think like,
oh,

787
00:34:40,731 --> 00:34:45,731
well this guy,
obviously it's an enormous vocabulary 

788
00:34:45,731 --> 00:34:48,670
and a deep understanding of anatomy.
He must therefore be this she master 

789
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,630
that he's pretending to be and it's kind
of very similar.

790
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:53,530
So I kind of recognize that pattern in 
the EU.

791
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,500
People like,
oh,

792
00:34:54,501 --> 00:34:59,501
I kind of see what you're doing.
You're throwing a bunch of very 

793
00:34:59,501 --> 00:35:02,021
complicated word that aren't in most 
people's vernacular and you're saying 

794
00:35:02,021 --> 00:35:05,381
them in a way that makes me feel like 
you have some sort of a connection to 

795
00:35:05,381 --> 00:35:09,590
the CI and to the shock rose into the 
inner whatever that everybody's trying 

796
00:35:09,591 --> 00:35:11,140
to reach to be happy.
Yeah,

797
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,910
and another problem is just that 
whenever there is a field,

798
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:15,680
whether it's physics or medicine or 
whatever,

799
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:18,650
where we know something,
but it's hard,

800
00:35:18,651 --> 00:35:20,300
complicated,
counter intuitive.

801
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,940
When we explained that we translate it 
right,

802
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:27,970
you know,
in physics we have mathematical 

803
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:27,970
equations that are quite an ambiguous as
to what they say,

804
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,330
but then we use words,
we say,

805
00:35:29,331 --> 00:35:31,040
well there's a cloud,
there's a probability,

806
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:36,070
etc.
And every translation is inaccurate in 

807
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:39,581
some sense.
So if you're bAsing beliefs off the 

808
00:35:39,581 --> 00:35:39,581
translations,

809
00:35:39,581 --> 00:35:44,300
then you can fudge them a little bit 
more to get almost wherever you want to 

810
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:44,300
go.
Oh,

811
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,100
you're confused me more.
I was good with the cloud up until now.

812
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:47,930
Why?
Why?

813
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,940
Why is it a cloud like why?
When you describing where the electron 

814
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,460
in habits,
why is it a cloud?

815
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:59,020
Well,
it's if you're thinking about the 

816
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,020
electron,
the,

817
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,970
the,
what the wave function is sort of how we

818
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:04,971
use it is you asked the question,
if I were to look for the location of 

819
00:36:04,971 --> 00:36:09,741
the electron,
there's a machine that tells me the 

820
00:36:09,741 --> 00:36:10,290
answer,
the probability of seeing it here with a

821
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:12,390
certain number of probability of seeing 
it,

822
00:36:12,391 --> 00:36:14,070
their probability,
seeing it somewhere else.

823
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:17,760
And so at every point in space there's a
number,

824
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,250
the probability you will see the 
electron there,

825
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:25,340
right?
So if you visualize all those 

826
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:25,340
probabilities all at once,
it looks like a cloud that is filling up

827
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:30,291
all of space and then the leap is to say
there's no such thing as where the 

828
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:32,190
electron is.
There'S only the cloud.

829
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:37,250
it's not like the cloud is expressing 
your ignorance of where the electron 

830
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,450
really is.
The cloud is what there really is.

831
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,090
And I sound exactly like deepak chopra 
or there's no way.

832
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:45,560
No,
no.

833
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,690
You don't bore versus electron cloud.
Oh yeah.

834
00:36:48,691 --> 00:36:51,360
Here we go.
Visualization of it.

835
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,650
It is.
That's right.

836
00:36:52,651 --> 00:36:53,610
Yeah.
So on the left,

837
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:58,640
these are.
This is the picture we like to draw 

838
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,980
electrons orbiting around as if they 
were little planets in the solar system 

839
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:05,480
on the right is closer to reality,
but you see even there they couldn't 

840
00:37:05,761 --> 00:37:10,761
quite resist the temptation to make it 
point to list and little dots and it's 

841
00:37:10,921 --> 00:37:13,560
really should be some smooth 
distribution.

842
00:37:13,561 --> 00:37:18,561
This is what the,
the physicist would call the thing on 

843
00:37:18,561 --> 00:37:21,441
the right,
the wave function or the quantum state 

844
00:37:21,441 --> 00:37:23,700
of the electron and it is that cloud and
it answers the question.

845
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:26,370
What's the likelihood that we see it in 
different places?

846
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,450
The hard part to mentally get to is the 
cloud is what is real,

847
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,350
is it almost like,
like what,

848
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:38,390
what we're looking at here with all 
these dots here and it says jamie would 

849
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:38,750
go back to where it wasn't pleased,
um,

850
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,660
where it says the probability of the 
density of electron and then you see all

851
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:47,661
those dots is the issue like making a 
visual representation of it.

852
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,580
Almost like,
like if I asked someone to draw a visual

853
00:37:50,581 --> 00:37:52,540
representation of a thought.
Yeah,

854
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,880
it's something like that.
Exactly.

855
00:37:53,881 --> 00:37:57,110
Because we're used to stuff,
coffee cups,

856
00:37:57,111 --> 00:37:59,850
bottles of water,
and like they have locations in space.

857
00:37:59,851 --> 00:38:02,490
They have a shape,
a size thoughts.

858
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:03,510
Yeah,
exactly.

859
00:38:03,511 --> 00:38:04,720
But it's hard to draw them.
Right?

860
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,690
Where's that going?
Where the hell is that?

861
00:38:06,691 --> 00:38:11,691
I mean,
that's the most important thing that 

862
00:38:11,691 --> 00:38:11,691
we've ever had when it comes to the 
creation of civilization,

863
00:38:11,691 --> 00:38:12,840
inventions,
innovation,

864
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:17,990
creativity,
all those things are just thoughts and 

865
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:17,990
try,
draw thought.

866
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:20,150
Right?
But when you were intuitive,

867
00:38:20,151 --> 00:38:20,530
we're,
we,

868
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:25,590
we get that.
You mean when you say he's hard to draw 

869
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:25,590
a song,
right?

870
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:25,590
But okay.
No,

871
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,540
what it is you can draw the musical 
notes and then.

872
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,100
But uh,
yeah,

873
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:35,100
and so if you talk about an electron 
that's supposed to be a thing I was 

874
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:39,830
supposed to be somewhere that I can like
find it and someone comes along and 

875
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:43,030
says,
no nature is totally different than that

876
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:48,540
and you will never in your life be able 
to see with perfectly clear eyeglasses 

877
00:38:48,581 --> 00:38:50,110
what nature is really like.

878
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,810
They get a little annoyed,
but it's the truth.

879
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:57,990
What do you think about the very uber 
bizarre theory that the universe is 

880
00:38:58,391 --> 00:39:02,260
incredibly fractal in the sense that 
what we're looking at when we're looking

881
00:39:02,261 --> 00:39:06,880
at the universe is essentially some sort
of subatomic particles for a much larger

882
00:39:06,881 --> 00:39:10,960
adam and then it goes bigger and bigger 
and then there's a human out there.

883
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:16,080
I think also a part of another galaxy 
that's also part of another universe.

884
00:39:16,511 --> 00:39:18,410
It's also part of another atom.
That's also right.

885
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:19,540
No,
I get it,

886
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:20,490
but no,
I think no,

887
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,560
the closest thing that is a little bit 
more reasonable to that.

888
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,060
well,
so let's go the other way around.

889
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:26,160
Yeah.
Um,

890
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:29,410
well let me ask me or let me ask you,
why is it no.

891
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,820
Well,
so let's go the other way around.

892
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:32,260
Okay.
Let's,

893
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:37,290
let's,
let's ask if maybe what we think of as 

894
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:40,051
adams could be alive with like little 
people and substructure that we just 

895
00:39:40,051 --> 00:39:40,051
don't know about.

896
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:44,020
So if you're an honest,
conscientious scientists,

897
00:39:44,021 --> 00:39:45,660
you always say we don't know for sure.
Right?

898
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:51,090
But what we,
everything that we think we know about 

899
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,461
quantum mechanics says that things like 
electrons and quarks are completely 

900
00:39:53,461 --> 00:39:56,170
featureless.
That if yOu tried to put little wrinkles

901
00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:01,190
and make them different,
like the earth and venus and mars are 

902
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,261
very different from each other.
Every electron is exactly the same as 

903
00:40:04,261 --> 00:40:07,441
every other electronic.
And if you tried to give it any 

904
00:40:07,441 --> 00:40:09,961
distinguishing features,
it would cost an enormous amount of 

905
00:40:09,961 --> 00:40:09,961
energy.
Energy that's just not there,

906
00:40:09,961 --> 00:40:14,850
so there's fundamental principles of 
physics that says that there are no 

907
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,851
people living on adam's okay,
and so what we're like with our solar 

908
00:40:17,851 --> 00:40:19,300
system,
even though it kind of vaguely resembles

909
00:40:19,301 --> 00:40:22,210
and adam in some sense,
we are nothing like real adams.

910
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:27,540
We could not be patched together to make
a solid object in this bigger world or 

911
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:27,540
anything like that.

912
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:32,130
So the.
So our exIstence sufficiently different 

913
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:35,730
from the summit atomic realm that I see 
no way that we could be the same thing 

914
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:37,720
as the subatomic realm to some bigger 
people.

915
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,960
I do think we could be living in a 
simulation as elon musk famously a 

916
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,710
suggested.
We could be all living in a computer 

917
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:46,710
simulation.
I don't think it's likely,

918
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,980
but it's completely plausible given what
we know right now.

919
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:53,160
Right?
The real issue is that one day we most 

920
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,291
likely will have something as long as 
technology continues to exponentially 

921
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:59,700
advanced,
will one day have something that's 

922
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,401
indiscernible from the reality,
there'll be able to interface more than 

923
00:41:02,401 --> 00:41:04,060
likely to be able to interface with your
senses,

924
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:09,180
with the way the mind perceives reality 
and create something that passes that 

925
00:41:09,821 --> 00:41:14,390
uncanny valley and literally feels like 
like real life matrix.

926
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,930
I think that we might be very far or we 
might be pretty close.

927
00:41:16,931 --> 00:41:19,120
I think it's hard to tell because 
there's so much We don't know right now.

928
00:41:19,121 --> 00:41:21,220
It's not like this is coming in the next
10 years,

929
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,720
but it could be a thousand,
but yeah,

930
00:41:22,721 --> 00:41:23,740
absolutely.
It could.

931
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:28,940
You know the thought experiment that 
that helps people accept this is you 

932
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,520
know,
a single neuron in your brain,

933
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:33,010
you have something like 100 billion 
neurons in your,

934
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,100
but every

935
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,830
single one is not that complicated.
It takes in some inputs,

936
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:41,850
outputs in some outputs.
It might be work to figure out exactly 

937
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:42,110
what it does,
but it's not mysterious.

938
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:47,140
Right?
So We couldn't imagine replacing one 

939
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:50,270
neuron in your brain with a solid state 
micro,

940
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:53,540
a device that does exactly the same 
thing as that neuron,

941
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:57,110
and you will be the same person roughly 
speaking,

942
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,130
right?
So,

943
00:41:58,131 --> 00:41:59,510
okay,
so if you believe that,

944
00:41:59,511 --> 00:42:04,511
then do that With 202 neurons and do it 
with three neurons and you're gradually 

945
00:42:04,511 --> 00:42:08,501
building up who you are,
but just replacing your brain with 

946
00:42:08,501 --> 00:42:10,130
something that is a machine made and if 
you believe that can happen,

947
00:42:10,131 --> 00:42:13,460
there's no reason to think that machines
can't be as human as we want them to be.

948
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:17,870
do you follow any ray kurzweil stuff?
A little bit.

949
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:18,950
I don't think that,
uh,

950
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,660
he's and especially deep thinker,
but he's a good one.

951
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:25,740
How are you counting on his desk?
I could be this mother fucker.

952
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,840
you don't think he's an deep thinker.
I mean,

953
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:34,850
he's a brilliant guys.
Invented a bunch of really fascinating 

954
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:34,850
things.

955
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:36,200
Yeah.
He likes to extrapolate without,

956
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:39,530
uh,
without limit pretty fearlessly.

957
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:44,710
Well,
he must have irritated you for you to 

958
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:46,361
jump right out with.
I don't think he's a particularly deep 

959
00:42:46,361 --> 00:42:46,361
thinker.
No,

960
00:42:46,361 --> 00:42:47,150
but I do think he serves a role.
I think there are people who,

961
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,790
uh,
make us think more deeply.

962
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,030
Like I remember seeing a panel 
discussion with,

963
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,110
uh,
murray gilman,

964
00:42:54,111 --> 00:42:56,060
who was a famous physicist and isaac 
asimov.

965
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:58,370
This was like 30 years ago when,
uh,

966
00:42:58,371 --> 00:43:00,450
as well as still alive.
And there was some,

967
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,900
someone else who's on the panel,
I forget,

968
00:43:02,901 --> 00:43:07,901
it was another physicist.
And the amazing thing was the science 

969
00:43:07,901 --> 00:43:11,921
fiction author was by far the most 
conservative thinker up there in terms 

970
00:43:11,921 --> 00:43:14,900
of what he thought would really be 
happening a thousand years from now.

971
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:19,930
Right?
The physicist had these Way out ideas 

972
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:19,930
and asthma was like,
yeah,

973
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:19,930
I don't think it's going to be all that 
different.

974
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,850
Right?
And it's just hard to predict the future

975
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,880
accurately.
And there's a role serve both by trying 

976
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,331
to be as realistic as possible and,
and careful and basie and saying what 

977
00:43:31,331 --> 00:43:31,331
are the probabilities?
And so forth.

978
00:43:31,331 --> 00:43:33,590
There's another role served by just 
being the,

979
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,510
a provocative in saying,
well,

980
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,190
maybe this crazy thing is going to 
happen.

981
00:43:37,191 --> 00:43:39,830
Maybe we'll cure death in the next 
hundred years.

982
00:43:39,831 --> 00:43:42,350
And a light bulb change for everybody 
dramatically.

983
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:43,910
That seems fairly likely,
right?

984
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,700
They'll to figure out some way to 
reverse aging.

985
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,810
Yeah.
I think that's plausible.

986
00:43:47,811 --> 00:43:49,100
There's no biological reason why not.

987
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:51,400
Kurzweil's got some weird motivations 
to.

988
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:56,050
he literally wants to sort of rebuild 
his father.

989
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,640
Yeah.
Yeah.

990
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:02,910
He wants to be able to piece together 
some sort of an artificial intelligence 

991
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:05,020
version of his father and go back and 
see him.

992
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,790
Yep.
that's deep.

993
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:08,790
That's a word for it.
Yeah.

994
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:17,520
He,
he thinks that there's gonna come a 

995
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:17,520
time,
uh,

996
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,130
inside his lifetime hopefully,
that you'll be able to download 

997
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:24,331
consciousness,
that consciousness is going to be 

998
00:44:24,331 --> 00:44:25,720
something you,
you'll transfer sort of like a code.

999
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,570
Yeah.
I think that there's,

1000
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:29,740
there's a difference between,
you know,

1001
00:44:29,741 --> 00:44:31,240
what is potentially

1002
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:37,010
given arbitrary amounts of time and 
resources and what is realistic in the 

1003
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,880
relatively near term.
By the near term we mean 50 or a hundred

1004
00:44:38,881 --> 00:44:39,560
years.
Right.

1005
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,900
And I think that people like ray 
kurzweil are far a exaggerating what's 

1006
00:44:45,031 --> 00:44:50,031
going to be possible the next 50 or 100 
years because they underestimate how 

1007
00:44:50,031 --> 00:44:50,730
little we know about how the brain 
works,

1008
00:44:50,731 --> 00:44:53,790
how important it is for the brain bring 
to be in our bodies,

1009
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:54,960
right?
We,

1010
00:44:55,330 --> 00:45:00,330
one of the,
one of the breakthroughs in artificial 

1011
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,451
intelligence over the last couple of 
decades was to realize that if you try 

1012
00:45:02,451 --> 00:45:03,120
to build an artificial intelligence 
computer,

1013
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:08,570
it's,
it becomes much more realistic if you 

1014
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:10,791
give it a body,
if you give it a face and it can 

1015
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,071
interact with people.
I mean we underestimate the extent to 

1016
00:45:13,071 --> 00:45:14,310
which having a body is an important part
of how we think and who we are.

1017
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:19,610
And these,
this is just like such baby steps and 

1018
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:20,850
understanding this stuff that to imagine
that in the matter of decades we'll have

1019
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:24,480
it all figured out and have downloadable
consciousnesses is not realistic to me.

1020
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:29,840
Do you think that we have to absolutely 
understand the exact way that the human 

1021
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,280
brain works in order to replicate its 
possibilities?

1022
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:33,660
No.
I mean,

1023
00:45:33,661 --> 00:45:36,740
I think that uh,
we probably won't step,

1024
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:41,750
probably won't be the way that we make 
artificial consciousness or artificial 

1025
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:46,041
intelligence,
like we won't just be reconstructing 

1026
00:45:46,041 --> 00:45:46,041
human beings.
Like when we made cars,

1027
00:45:46,041 --> 00:45:47,820
we didn't reconstruct horses.
Right.

1028
00:45:47,821 --> 00:45:52,821
We just did it in a very,
very different way in cars are much 

1029
00:45:52,821 --> 00:45:55,431
better than horses and in various ways 
not as good in other ways like going on 

1030
00:45:55,521 --> 00:45:56,880
the hills,
going up hills.

1031
00:45:56,881 --> 00:45:57,560
But also,
you know,

1032
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,390
in the early days of cars,
one big complaint was.

1033
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:03,000
But if I'm drunk and passed out,
it won't take me home.

1034
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,110
I'll buy.
Does that a complaint?

1035
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,630
That was a complaint.
Hilarious.

1036
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:08,640
Because the horse had just take you home
and knows how to get there.

1037
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:09,750
Exactly.
Finally,

1038
00:46:09,751 --> 00:46:11,640
we'll get the artificial and nobody gets
mad.

1039
00:46:11,641 --> 00:46:13,460
Self driving cars will be able to do it.
Finally,

1040
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,300
if you're driving a horse drunk,
nobody gives a shit.

1041
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,410
No,
you're passed out.

1042
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,380
That's right.
Yeah.

1043
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:19,050
That'd be like a big adjustment for 
people.

1044
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:19,860
Yeah,
exactly.

1045
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:24,900
More trunk.
And so the idea that the way that will 

1046
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,981
make artificial intelligence is just 
sort of mimic a human being is just 

1047
00:46:27,981 --> 00:46:28,560
crazy.
That's not how it's going to be.

1048
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,930
What do you think it's gonna be like,
well,

1049
00:46:30,931 --> 00:46:31,540
I don't know.
There are.

1050
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:36,740
There are problems that can be solved by
things that we design or just a 

1051
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:41,250
different set of problems than the thing
that evolution naturally made us do.

1052
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,680
Right?
Like evolution built a very,

1053
00:46:43,681 --> 00:46:48,681
very general purpose machine that is 
inefficient and irrational and all sorts

1054
00:46:48,961 --> 00:46:53,961
of ways like anyone's pocket calculator 
since the 19 seventies can multiply 

1055
00:46:53,961 --> 00:46:55,110
numbers way better than your brain can 
write.

1056
00:46:55,470 --> 00:47:00,470
Your brain has enormously more 
computational capacity than a pocket 

1057
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:01,080
calculator.
Why can't we multiply numbers?

1058
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,830
That ability was not important back when
we were evolving these things.

1059
00:47:04,831 --> 00:47:09,831
Right?
So the set of things that it is easy to 

1060
00:47:09,831 --> 00:47:10,170
design is just very,
very different than what the brain does.

1061
00:47:10,171 --> 00:47:12,060
So who knows?
I don't know exactly what it will be,

1062
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:15,030
what it will look like.
I actually think that the more important

1063
00:47:15,031 --> 00:47:19,170
thing we'll be blurring the distinction 
between human beings and machines.

1064
00:47:19,171 --> 00:47:20,910
You know the,
the crossovers.

1065
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:24,330
This is another one of elon musk's 
project is called the neuro link.

1066
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:29,750
The idea of basically a neural lace,
something that is just interfacing your 

1067
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:30,070
brain very,

1068
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,770
very,
very fast so that you have access to the

1069
00:47:32,771 --> 00:47:36,370
entire internet or whatever peripherals 
you want in real time.

1070
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:39,160
So wikipedia is part of your memory 
essentially,

1071
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,550
and that's just who you are and how you 
walk around and you can multiply numbers

1072
00:47:42,551 --> 00:47:46,560
as fast as you want to.
That seems very likely that augmented,

1073
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,340
augmented reality.
Yeah.

1074
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:53,710
Yeah.
And some sort of a weird symbiotic 

1075
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,120
connection to the net into the 
electronics,

1076
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,850
whether it's a wearable thing or maybe 
even an embedded thing.

1077
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:58,410
Yeah,
that's.

1078
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,380
I think it will be embedded.
So yeah,

1079
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,930
this is more efficient.
We use.

1080
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,390
We will you be one of the first 
adopters?

1081
00:48:04,391 --> 00:48:09,391
Are you gonna wait a little while.
I'm never a first generation adopt or 

1082
00:48:09,391 --> 00:48:09,391
even have iphones much less,
you know,

1083
00:48:09,391 --> 00:48:10,720
things embedded in my body.
But look,

1084
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,960
I just adopted two kittens.
They get microchip implants.

1085
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:19,110
Oh yeah.
You adopt a cat that gets a microchip 

1086
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:19,110
inside so you can't lose it.

1087
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:20,260
Yeah.
And so to think that we're very far away

1088
00:48:20,261 --> 00:48:21,640
from doing that,
I don't think is right.

1089
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,290
I think that we're going to be doing 
things.

1090
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:28,310
I was just looking at a a laptop bag.
It's a laptop bag that also is a.

1091
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:34,410
You have a passport bag and a laptop bag
and then a carry on and then a check and

1092
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:40,520
sto for airport airplane luggage and all
of it is bluetooth and all of it is 

1093
00:48:41,381 --> 00:48:46,060
location coordinated with gps so that if
somehow or another your bag gets lost,

1094
00:48:46,061 --> 00:48:48,970
you literally can go on a computer and 
I'll show you where your bag is.

1095
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:50,770
Like,
whoa,

1096
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,530
how long are we going?
When are we going to do that with people

1097
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,060
and I feel,
you know,

1098
00:48:55,061 --> 00:48:57,490
I,
I'm a big believer in privacy rights and

1099
00:48:57,491 --> 00:48:58,870
so forth.
Her dilemma,

1100
00:48:58,871 --> 00:49:01,150
do I let my employer microchipping what 
does this.

1101
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:06,150
There you go.
There's a company in Wisconsin that had 

1102
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:08,830
microchip day on August 1st and they 
implanted microchips and people first of

1103
00:49:08,831 --> 00:49:11,530
all,
that dude with his ears in that,

1104
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,590
those fucking earplugs and the lower ear
lobe thing.

1105
00:49:14,591 --> 00:49:17,560
You ain't doing nothing buddy.
Sticking that in me.

1106
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:22,590
Look what you've done in your ears.
Fellow Wisconsin company becomes first 

1107
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:23,350
us employee.
What,

1108
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:25,750
and these are very simple,
just location tracking things.

1109
00:49:25,751 --> 00:49:30,751
Right?
Why would you allow the company to do 

1110
00:49:30,751 --> 00:49:32,671
that?
I wouldn't allow my company to tattoo 

1111
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,561
me.
Why would I allow my company to 

1112
00:49:34,561 --> 00:49:35,881
microchip?
It's for tracking and you can also like 

1113
00:49:35,881 --> 00:49:35,881
they can buy stuff in the cafeteria and 
one,

1114
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,810
you know what else you could do use your
wallet.

1115
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:39,740
You say that,
but you know,

1116
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:43,930
do you turn off all cookies when you 
have your laptop on and your browser.

1117
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:44,970
So I do know.

1118
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,890
No I don't because it's convenient and 
these guys they like,

1119
00:49:47,891 --> 00:49:52,891
they get,
they can buy their snacks with their 

1120
00:49:52,891 --> 00:49:52,891
microchip.
Well wasn't the machine and get a snack,

1121
00:49:52,891 --> 00:49:57,570
but here's where therefore separation 
every last this laptop I can go like 

1122
00:49:57,570 --> 00:50:01,890
that and then I could walk out the door 
on that laptop stays here and all the 

1123
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:03,250
cookies and all my browser history stays
here.

1124
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,100
It doesn't.
It's not an estimate.

1125
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:08,440
They want you to think now you're 
freaking me out.

1126
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:14,610
Another thing I wanted to talk to you 
about with quantum mechanics that came 

1127
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:14,680
out of that movie,
what the bleep.

1128
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:19,740
That was very confusing to a lot of 
people was the whole observer effect.

1129
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:26,370
Now that is something that I've tried to
explain to people that the issue is,

1130
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,720
well please,
if you could explaIn it like this is the

1131
00:50:29,721 --> 00:50:34,721
thing is that people believe that in 
quantum physics it's been proven that if

1132
00:50:35,331 --> 00:50:39,560
you look at things that you looking at 
things changes those things,

1133
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:42,440
but the way it's been described to me,
it's like,

1134
00:50:42,441 --> 00:50:47,441
no,
it's actually because you are measuring 

1135
00:50:47,441 --> 00:50:48,320
those things and that's what changes it.

1136
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,470
The act of measuring in.
Yeah,

1137
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:55,630
and that there's some sort of physical 
interaction when you're measuring 

1138
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:56,270
something.
That's what's changing the effect.

1139
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,260
Is that correct?
Yeah,

1140
00:50:57,261 --> 00:51:02,261
I think that's right.
The this is a legacy of the battle days 

1141
00:51:02,261 --> 00:51:05,411
of quantum mechanics.
When people were a little bit fuzzy 

1142
00:51:05,411 --> 00:51:05,630
about these things,
it was better at it.

1143
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:10,660
The bad old days like battle rap,
battle days maybe like see einstein and 

1144
00:51:10,761 --> 00:51:12,470
bohr going at it,
rap battle,

1145
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:17,770
the bad old days when people had a more 
limited understanding of what quantum 

1146
00:51:18,051 --> 00:51:21,740
mechanics really is and spoke about it 
and slightly sloppy ways,

1147
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:26,830
so there is the truth that if you want 
to describe what you see when you look 

1148
00:51:28,011 --> 00:51:33,011
at an electron,
what you see is different than what it 

1149
00:51:33,011 --> 00:51:35,111
is like you.
You do change it by looking at it and 

1150
00:51:35,111 --> 00:51:39,011
therefore back in the battle days,
a lot of people wondered whether there 

1151
00:51:39,011 --> 00:51:42,851
was something special about 
consciousness or human perception or 

1152
00:51:42,851 --> 00:51:45,410
something that was helping us explain 
the laws of quantum mechanics.

1153
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:49,210
So as you are pointing toward no,
the answer's no.

1154
00:51:49,211 --> 00:51:52,520
There's nothing special about quantum 
mechanics and consciousness in any way.

1155
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:56,990
A rock could do the same thing or a 
video camera or a speck of dust.

1156
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:02,240
The the quantum mechanics rules says 
that things change when systems interact

1157
00:52:02,241 --> 00:52:05,150
with each other.
The way that you described the system is

1158
00:52:05,151 --> 00:52:10,151
different when it's all by itself.
Then when it interacts in some 

1159
00:52:10,151 --> 00:52:10,820
interesting way with some other system 
and that system can be a person,

1160
00:52:10,821 --> 00:52:15,821
but it can be anything else also.
So in that famous experiment that's in 

1161
00:52:15,821 --> 00:52:19,601
that cartoon that gets passed around by 
people every two or three years when 

1162
00:52:19,601 --> 00:52:19,760
they're like,
wow,

1163
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:22,490
the world's made the magic and they pass
this around.

1164
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:24,440
It's usually a yoga teacher.
They,

1165
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:25,760
um,
that,

1166
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:28,490
that shows that the,
you know,

1167
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,850
there's the particles in the waves.
Indeed.

1168
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,620
Do you remember the saving and funding?

1169
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:37,700
I know it's dr quantum when we get in 
trouble playing that be maybe for 

1170
00:52:38,961 --> 00:52:41,270
shitting on it,
we will get mad at us.

1171
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:44,360
We might get pulled,
we get pulled from you had a good run.

1172
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,260
What people,
you know,

1173
00:52:45,261 --> 00:52:49,460
they own these videos and so it's a real
issue is wildlife videos.

1174
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,130
Those suckers,
they're,

1175
00:52:51,131 --> 00:52:53,360
they're so quick to pull the trigger and
you know,

1176
00:52:53,361 --> 00:52:54,680
they have a claim.
It's their video.

1177
00:52:54,681 --> 00:52:56,630
So if you use working together.
Yeah.

1178
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,930
So if you use it in mock,
whatever is happening,

1179
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:01,520
or even if you tell them,
hey,

1180
00:53:01,521 --> 00:53:03,680
go watch this video,
it's on youtube,

1181
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:04,640
here's the name of it,
right?

1182
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:06,620
You would think that'd be like good 
advertising,

1183
00:53:06,621 --> 00:53:09,940
but no,
get here.

1184
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:12,430
I'll bring it up and I can.
We can like talk about it a little bit.

1185
00:53:12,431 --> 00:53:13,990
Okay.
So give,

1186
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,810
give me some volume so I could hear what
they say.

1187
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:18,040
Yeah,
that's it.

1188
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:20,630
Yeah.
The double slit experiment,

1189
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:25,690
right see is similar to

1190
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:30,980
the line.
The marbles make bar when we add the 

1191
00:53:31,051 --> 00:53:34,380
second slip,
something different.

1192
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:40,110
If the top of one wave meets the bottom 
of another way,

1193
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:45,920
they cancel each other out.
So now there is an interference pattern 

1194
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:51,560
on the back wall.
Places where the two tops meet are the 

1195
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:56,091
highest intensity.
The bright lines and where they cancel 

1196
00:53:56,091 --> 00:54:00,690
there is nothing.
So when we throw things that is matter 

1197
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:06,590
through two slits,
we get this two vans and hits and with 

1198
00:54:07,741 --> 00:54:12,060
waves we get an interference pattern of 
many bands.

1199
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:17,760
Good so far.
Now let's go quantum.

1200
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:22,960
So now you're going to freak out.
This is where you start getting mad 

1201
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,210
quantum quantum,
I know,

1202
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,020
tiny,
tiny bit of matter,

1203
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:33,940
like a tiny marble fire street already 
shaking his head folks.

1204
00:54:34,031 --> 00:54:35,010
It's not a tiny marbles.

1205
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:38,660
You got to do a little bit of commentary
on we can't just play the whole video.

1206
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:44,290
I can do the gun.
I know exactly what they're talking 

1207
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:44,290
about.
That's very famous experiment.

1208
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:47,411
So yeah,
so if you have two slits that you let 

1209
00:54:47,411 --> 00:54:51,640
marbles go through,
they get two slits in the receiving 

1210
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,050
screen on the other side,
right.

1211
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:54,980
Whereas if you let a wave go through two
slits,

1212
00:54:54,981 --> 00:54:56,600
you get this interference pattern.
Right?

1213
00:54:56,810 --> 00:55:00,680
And so what happens when you let an 
electron go through?

1214
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,690
The answer is you get an interference 
pattern.

1215
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:07,750
It's more like a wave than a particle,
but the real weird thing that they're 

1216
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:09,080
going to get to eventually is if you 
have.

1217
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:11,240
If you let an electron go through two 
slits,

1218
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:15,200
but you put little detectors on the 
slits,

1219
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:19,040
so you say which detect which slit did 
the electron go through.

1220
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:22,340
Then it always says it goes through one 
or the other.

1221
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:27,490
It never goes through both.
And the interference pattern on the 

1222
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:30,791
other side disappears.
You only see the two lines that you 

1223
00:55:30,791 --> 00:55:31,140
would have seen if they were marble 
link.

1224
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:36,490
So the point is when you're not looking,
the electron is acting like a wave and 

1225
00:55:36,591 --> 00:55:39,590
when you're look at it,
the electron acts like a particle.

1226
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,720
That is the lesson of the double slit 
experiment.

1227
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:43,880
Right?
Why?

1228
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:49,960
Why?
Because when you put that detector on 

1229
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,250
the slits,
you interacted with the electron and you

1230
00:55:52,251 --> 00:55:53,570
localized it,
right?

1231
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:56,030
There was no such thing as the position 
of the electron.

1232
00:55:56,031 --> 00:55:57,770
There was no such thing as the answer to
the question.

1233
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:00,230
Did it go through one slit or the other?
There was only a cloud.

1234
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:05,290
There's only a wave going through,
but you affected it or whatever the 

1235
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:09,370
detector was affected it.
When it looked through the slits to see 

1236
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:13,451
did it go through this one or this one 
and that affect changed it from being 

1237
00:56:13,451 --> 00:56:15,950
going through both lists to being only 
going through one and how does it affect

1238
00:56:15,951 --> 00:56:16,400
it like that?

1239
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:18,010
Well,
there's this what,

1240
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:23,230
what's called quantum entanglement.
The detector becomes entangled with the 

1241
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:28,230
electron and this is where you get into 
what I my favorite version of quantum 

1242
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:29,440
mechanics,
which is the many worlds interpretation.

1243
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:33,490
The the right wAy to think about the 
electron was that cloud,

1244
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,430
that wave going through.
That's the natural thing.

1245
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:39,790
The weird thing is that when you look at
the different slits,

1246
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:42,550
you only see it go through one or the 
other and it acts like a particle.

1247
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:44,980
So how do you explain that?
So in other words,

1248
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,160
our natural intuitive way of thinking 
about electrons is as particles.

1249
00:56:48,161 --> 00:56:50,110
Little marbles and quantum mechanics 
says,

1250
00:56:50,111 --> 00:56:50,400
no,
no,

1251
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,420
no.
It's naturally a wave.

1252
00:56:52,421 --> 00:56:57,421
The weird thing is when it acts like a 
particle and if you are many worlds 

1253
00:56:57,421 --> 00:57:01,171
person,
what the answer you give is the 

1254
00:57:01,171 --> 00:57:03,481
following.
When you look to see to the electron go 

1255
00:57:03,481 --> 00:57:06,331
through one slit or the other you or 
whatever video camera you had or 

1256
00:57:06,331 --> 00:57:10,711
whatever becomes entangled with the 
electron and what that means is that the

1257
00:57:10,721 --> 00:57:15,721
wave function of the whole universe,
the wave function of both the electron 

1258
00:57:15,721 --> 00:57:19,081
but also your camera and you and the 
stars and galaxies and so forth splits 

1259
00:57:19,081 --> 00:57:23,671
into and there is now one branch of the 
wave function which which acts like its 

1260
00:57:23,671 --> 00:57:28,621
own separate world which says the 
electron went through the left slit and 

1261
00:57:28,621 --> 00:57:33,211
your cameras saw it go through the left 
slit and it made a little line on the 

1262
00:57:33,211 --> 00:57:35,530
other side and there's another branch 
which says the electron went through the

1263
00:57:35,531 --> 00:57:40,531
right slipped and your cameras,
so it goes through the rites lit and it 

1264
00:57:40,531 --> 00:57:41,980
makes a line on the other side and so 
they're both still there,

1265
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:44,740
but the world split into and now you're 
only in one of them.

1266
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:46,150
You don't see the whole world anymore.

1267
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:50,140
You managed to make it more confusing.
Congratulations.

1268
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:53,320
Screwed my head up even more.
I did that.

1269
00:57:53,321 --> 00:57:54,220
I understand it.
The less,

1270
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:59,221
now that's even more baffling,
but the bit you understand is actually 

1271
00:57:59,221 --> 00:57:59,221
true.
That's true.

1272
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:04,520
Well,
it's a little illusion of understanding 

1273
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:04,520
doesn't count.
Oh,

1274
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,410
okay.
So by not understanding,

1275
00:58:05,411 --> 00:58:07,810
I understand more.
There you go.

1276
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:10,540
Boy,
you have a weird job.

1277
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:13,240
A very,
very weird job.

1278
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:13,930
Well,
it,

1279
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,840
I,
I get it now though in talking to you,

1280
00:58:16,841 --> 00:58:17,740
why,
you know,

1281
00:58:17,741 --> 00:58:21,610
you have the deepak chopra's of the 
world and why you have the,

1282
00:58:21,611 --> 00:58:26,470
what the bleeps because it's so 
intensely confusing.

1283
00:58:26,471 --> 00:58:31,471
Yeah.
And especially with the limitations of 

1284
00:58:31,471 --> 00:58:34,440
language of just counter intuitive,
it's against every little bit of our 

1285
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:38,551
everyday experience.
It's a set of concepts that were not 

1286
00:58:38,551 --> 00:58:41,101
equipped with that.
We're not born with that we have to 

1287
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:41,101
struggle to get into our heads over 
many,

1288
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:42,520
many years.
And it shouldn't be surprising.

1289
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:48,300
So you as an educator,
when you were talking to people about 

1290
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,680
this,
it's obviously you've probably done this

1291
00:58:50,681 --> 00:58:51,940
thousands of times,
right?

1292
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:55,810
And tried to have theSe kind of weird 
conversations with people like myself.

1293
00:58:55,811 --> 00:58:59,770
That's sort of lack the tools to really 
truly understand what you're saying.

1294
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:01,200
Um,
what,

1295
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:05,530
what does that mean?
It's got to be frustrating in a sense or

1296
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:06,340
no,
I love it.

1297
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:06,980
Yeah,
you do.

1298
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:07,570
Yeah,
I do.

1299
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:08,300
Yeah,
that's correct.

1300
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,760
Because what a great attitude

1301
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,980
I was there.
That used to be me,

1302
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:15,430
like it's not like my brain was born 
ready to understand quantum mechanics.

1303
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:17,440
Uh,
I worked at it and struggled with it and

1304
00:59:17,441 --> 00:59:18,430
got it wrong.
And who knows,

1305
00:59:18,431 --> 00:59:20,030
maybe 10 years from now will think,
oh,

1306
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,860
you're so stupid 10 years ago.
Right?

1307
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:27,280
But I think that it can be understood.
I think that people who wants to try to 

1308
00:59:27,501 --> 00:59:32,120
understand it a number one are already 
90 percent of the way to being awesome.

1309
00:59:32,121 --> 00:59:34,430
And number two,
the remaining 10 percent is very,

1310
00:59:34,431 --> 00:59:36,290
very achievable.
It is understandable.

1311
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:41,440
Wasn't it fireman that said,
if you think you understand quantum 

1312
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:41,440
mechanics,
you don't understand quantum mechanics.

1313
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,410
Uh,
he said something like that.

1314
00:59:42,411 --> 00:59:45,920
He said he can safely say that nobody 
understands quantum mechanics,

1315
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:51,850
which is fine,
except that you should therefore be 

1316
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:52,470
outraged.
You should not be proud of that.

1317
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:56,040
He was kind of a funny guy.
Oh yeah.

1318
00:59:56,041 --> 01:00:01,041
He's being funny.
And I think that it's certainly true 

1319
01:00:01,041 --> 01:00:01,041
that we don't understand quantum 
mechanics,

1320
01:00:01,041 --> 01:00:05,020
if I understand,
you mean both understand and everyone 

1321
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:07,100
else agrees that you understand.
Maybe someone understands it,

1322
01:00:07,101 --> 01:00:09,800
but certainly there's no consensus on 
the right way to understand it,

1323
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,650
no consensus in the right way to 
understand that.

1324
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,930
It was a very disturbing concept.
People like me,

1325
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:16,310
we want you to say,
well,

1326
01:00:16,311 --> 01:00:19,440
water is wet and oxygen is this.
You know,

1327
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:22,220
this is what it is.
I think a thousand years from now,

1328
01:00:22,221 --> 01:00:27,221
historians of science will look back on 
the 20th century and shake their heads 

1329
01:00:27,221 --> 01:00:27,410
in despair.
They'll say,

1330
01:00:27,411 --> 01:00:28,120
look,
you guys,

1331
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:32,180
quantum mechanics fell into your lap and
you didn't spend any time thinking about

1332
01:00:32,181 --> 01:00:37,181
it.
You didn't try very hard to understand 

1333
01:00:37,181 --> 01:00:37,181
it.
That's embarrassing.

1334
01:00:37,181 --> 01:00:39,970
Really.
Like the general public or science 

1335
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:39,970
professional scientists,
people with phds in theoretical physics.

1336
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:44,781
Wow.
So when it comes to the people that you 

1337
01:00:44,781 --> 01:00:49,061
were talking about,
like scientists sort of dismiss quantum 

1338
01:00:49,061 --> 01:00:52,121
mechanics,
what are they dismissing and how are 

1339
01:00:52,121 --> 01:00:52,121
they doing?
Well,

1340
01:00:52,121 --> 01:00:52,121
to be very,
very clear,

1341
01:00:52,121 --> 01:00:53,210
they're not dismissing quantum 
mechanics.

1342
01:00:53,211 --> 01:00:55,820
They use quantum mechanics everyday.
They love quantum mechanics.

1343
01:00:55,821 --> 01:01:00,821
Quantum mechanics is a recipe for 
calculating what's going to happen in 

1344
01:01:00,821 --> 01:01:00,980
your experiment.

1345
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:06,010
That is an unprecedented precision.
It's really the best way we have of 

1346
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:08,240
knowing what's going to happen in the 
lab that we've ever invented and there's

1347
01:01:08,241 --> 01:01:11,660
no reason to think that it's wrong,
but then when you press them on,

1348
01:01:11,661 --> 01:01:13,700
okay,
what was really happening?

1349
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:18,260
What is the description of reality that 
corresponds to the calculation you just.

1350
01:01:18,261 --> 01:01:23,261
Did they get annoyed and frustrated with
you rather than give you an answer to 

1351
01:01:23,261 --> 01:01:24,170
the question?
I'm sorry.

1352
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:29,350
Like what?
Do they get annoyed and frustrated with 

1353
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:31,451
you?
Like when you have these conversations 

1354
01:01:31,451 --> 01:01:31,451
with these people?
With anyone?

1355
01:01:31,451 --> 01:01:31,451
Yeah,
they will.

1356
01:01:31,451 --> 01:01:32,290
You will.
Because they don't understand this.

1357
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:34,610
Well,
they don't understand which is fine,

1358
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:39,650
but they act as if not understanding it 
is okay and to me that is not fine.

1359
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:44,680
They will say,
my job's not to understand the world is 

1360
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,751
just to make predictions and I think 
that's not really the job of science or 

1361
01:01:46,751 --> 01:01:47,000
physics at all.

1362
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,280
Their job is not understand.
It's to make predictions.

1363
01:01:50,281 --> 01:01:55,281
Well,
how can you make predictions if you 

1364
01:01:55,281 --> 01:01:56,471
don't understand what you're making?
A prediction that is exactly the 

1365
01:01:56,471 --> 01:01:56,471
situation with quantum mechanics right 
now.

1366
01:01:56,471 --> 01:01:59,000
Like we have a recipe,
we have an algorithm set of rules,

1367
01:01:59,001 --> 01:01:59,660
do this,
do this,

1368
01:01:59,661 --> 01:02:00,890
do this.
You get an answer,

1369
01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:06,830
and the answer is right.
The answer is verified and experiments 

1370
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:06,830
over and over again,
and you say,

1371
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:06,830
well,
okay,

1372
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:07,250
why is it right?
What was happening?

1373
01:02:07,251 --> 01:02:09,200
What is the thing that is moving around?
And they go,

1374
01:02:09,201 --> 01:02:09,800
oh no,
no,

1375
01:02:09,801 --> 01:02:12,980
don't ask me about that.
That's hilarious.

1376
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:17,120
Now what do you do most of the time when
you're not teaching?

1377
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:20,120
So like if you're working on this stuff,
like I,

1378
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:23,430
I would imagine there's not someone 
telling you what to do.

1379
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:24,810
Right?
So when you're,

1380
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,790
when you're working on this kind of 
stuff,

1381
01:02:26,791 --> 01:02:27,990
like how do you structure it?

1382
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,350
Yeah,
it's up to you,

1383
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:34,380
you know,
there's this sort of a selection effect 

1384
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:34,380
that did that.
The ability to structure on your own is,

1385
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:37,140
is necessary to get to a certain stage 
in your career.

1386
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:38,490
But uh,
yeah,

1387
01:02:38,491 --> 01:02:43,491
I had students graduate students who I 
work with as well as other colleagues 

1388
01:02:43,491 --> 01:02:44,490
that I collaborate with,
but it's roughly speaking,

1389
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:46,860
going into the office or going to a 
cafe,

1390
01:02:46,861 --> 01:02:49,560
sitting down with a piece of paper and a
pencil and writing.

1391
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:51,720
That's what I do.
That's my job.

1392
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:56,860
You go to the office or a cafe and you 
sit down with like one of these yellow 

1393
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:57,990
legal pads and you write all that 
chicken scratch that.

1394
01:02:57,991 --> 01:03:00,870
Nobody understands.
But you guys have recently changed.

1395
01:03:00,871 --> 01:03:04,440
Now I have an ipad pro with an apple 
pencil and I do you do all that.

1396
01:03:04,441 --> 01:03:06,390
Only very,
very recently upgraded.

1397
01:03:06,391 --> 01:03:09,290
But maybe you can get yourself onto them
saying samsung note eight,

1398
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,680
that it has the pen on it.

1399
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,960
Have you seen that?
That's pretty bad ass.

1400
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:13,850
You can.
Yeah.

1401
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:16,950
While the screen is dark like this,
you don't have to turn the screen on.

1402
01:03:16,951 --> 01:03:20,820
You pull out the stylists and you can 
draw notes on screen.

1403
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:23,850
Okay.
Up until I got 180 pages of notes.

1404
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,030
Like on the actual screen itself,
you don't even have to open it up.

1405
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:28,380
All right,
that's pretty cool.

1406
01:03:28,381 --> 01:03:30,060
But now I'm invested,
now I got the ipad,

1407
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:31,830
so I know that's how it works.
Right?

1408
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:34,710
But the things,
the differences can carry that around in

1409
01:03:34,711 --> 01:03:35,580
your pocket.
Yeah,

1410
01:03:35,581 --> 01:03:36,920
I know that is a difference.
Yeah.

1411
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:42,140
But um,
so when the idea is that there's a set 

1412
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:43,380
of questions in our brains as 
professional physicists,

1413
01:03:43,381 --> 01:03:46,200
there's an infinite number of questions,
but at any one time you're focusing on a

1414
01:03:46,201 --> 01:03:50,790
couple and you have a couple of ideas.
And so you say to yourself,

1415
01:03:50,791 --> 01:03:53,250
well,
maybe if things are like this,

1416
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:56,610
then this would follow and let's try to 
calculate what that would lead to.

1417
01:03:56,610 --> 01:03:59,670
And does that lead us someplace good?
Or is that just crashed and burned?

1418
01:03:59,671 --> 01:04:04,671
And that's what you do over and over 
again until you get a paper you can 

1419
01:04:04,671 --> 01:04:04,671
write.
And where do you start from?

1420
01:04:04,671 --> 01:04:07,080
Like what is a,
like let's say you get to the cafe,

1421
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:09,630
like what's your starting point?
Well,

1422
01:04:09,631 --> 01:04:12,510
so for example,
let's do quantum mechanics.

1423
01:04:12,770 --> 01:04:14,880
So we want to understand,
um,

1424
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:17,340
the many worlds interpretation of 
quantum mechanics.

1425
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:21,630
So you say that the world really is some
quantum wave function,

1426
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:26,930
but you and I observe things like space 
and tables and stuff like that.

1427
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,940
Right?
So what does that mean?

1428
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:34,970
What does it mean to say that there's a,
there's a table lurking in the wave 

1429
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:36,150
function of the universe or there's no 
stars and galaxies.

1430
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:41,180
So that means that there's some way of 
writing the wave function of the 

1431
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:43,830
universe that is sort of here's a table,
here's the rest of the universe.

1432
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,680
So I might write down on a piece of 
paper,

1433
01:04:46,681 --> 01:04:50,520
well here is a toy model,
like a simple representation of the wave

1434
01:04:50,521 --> 01:04:55,521
function of the universe that includes 
one piece and another piece and they're 

1435
01:04:55,521 --> 01:04:56,990
interacting with each other.
How would I know that that was tabled?

1436
01:04:57,060 --> 01:05:02,060
Like how,
how would I know in tables they're not 

1437
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:02,530
really what we care about,
but why is space three dimensional,

1438
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:07,730
right?
This is the kind of question we would 

1439
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:09,201
worry about.
So what would a wave function look like 

1440
01:05:09,201 --> 01:05:09,201
that represented three dimensional 
space?

1441
01:05:09,201 --> 01:05:13,851
Is that natural?
Could I poke at it and kind of make a 

1442
01:05:13,851 --> 01:05:14,720
prediction for what the early universe 
was like on the basis of that?

1443
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:19,600
Things like that.
So now like when you do calculations,

1444
01:05:19,601 --> 01:05:22,360
like say if you were doing calculus,
do you study black holes at all?

1445
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:22,990
A little bit,
yeah.

1446
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,360
A little bit reading paper right now on 
black or are you?

1447
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:26,860
Yeah.
And what are you writing about?

1448
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,210
Like what specifically?
Well,

1449
01:05:28,211 --> 01:05:30,910
there's this famous problem in black 
holes that they evaporate,

1450
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:32,230
right?
They give off radiation.

1451
01:05:32,231 --> 01:05:36,100
Stephen hawking back in the 19 seventies
said that black holes weren't completely

1452
01:05:36,101 --> 01:05:37,300
black.
Right?

1453
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:42,420
There's,
there's quantum mechanics as they will 

1454
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:43,000
gradually evaporate away.
So that's fine.

1455
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:45,040
We think we understand that.
What does that mean?

1456
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:48,050
What does it mean to be,
they're not completely,

1457
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:53,100
but what it is,
what a black hole is essentially like 

1458
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:56,491
the event horizon is this tiny,
infinitely dense area and it's sucking 

1459
01:05:56,681 --> 01:05:59,400
in the galaxy around it.
And uh,

1460
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:04,440
like supermassive black holes.
that is that there is this still 

1461
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,790
believed that there in the center of 
every galaxy and they represent one half

1462
01:06:06,791 --> 01:06:08,920
of one percent of the mass of the galaxy
itself.

1463
01:06:08,921 --> 01:06:09,670
Tiny fraction.
Right?

1464
01:06:09,671 --> 01:06:14,671
So the larger the galaxy,
the larger the supermassive black hole 

1465
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:14,671
basically.

1466
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:14,671
Yeah,
that's right.

1467
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:16,600
So what is it?
So what is the black,

1468
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:17,440
what is it?
Yeah,

1469
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:22,500
a black hole is a region of space.
It's a region of space where the 

1470
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:25,390
gravitational field is so strong that 
you can never leave that region of space

1471
01:06:25,391 --> 01:06:27,570
to go to the outside world.
Jesus,

1472
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,550
that's what it is.
But.

1473
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:32,230
So stephen hawking,
so that's the,

1474
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:37,250
there's,
there's different sort of levels of 

1475
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:37,250
sophistication and thinking about what 
black holes are.

1476
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:40,960
So a one level is to forget about 
quantum mechanics entirely.

1477
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:46,500
Use general relativity.
Einstein's theory of gravity that he 

1478
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:47,290
invented 100 years ago,
1916.

1479
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,660
And he says,
what is gravity?

1480
01:06:49,661 --> 01:06:53,020
It's spacetime curving on itself.
That's what gravity is.

1481
01:06:53,021 --> 01:06:54,790
And he has equations to tell you how 
much space,

1482
01:06:54,791 --> 01:06:56,020
time curves,
etc.

1483
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:59,380
So we can describe black holes in,
in those terms.

1484
01:06:59,381 --> 01:07:03,190
and one of the things you find is that 
black holes only ever increase in size,

1485
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:03,450
right?

1486
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:08,460
They can suck things in,
but they'd never shrink because they 

1487
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:09,130
just suck things in.
But then in the 19 seventies,

1488
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:10,240
stephen hawking says,
well,

1489
01:07:10,241 --> 01:07:13,720
what if we take into account quantum 
mechanics?

1490
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:15,110
There are,
you know,

1491
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:18,040
there's these clouds of probability all 
around the black hole.

1492
01:07:18,041 --> 01:07:19,630
And he says,
if I look at a black hole,

1493
01:07:19,631 --> 01:07:24,631
does it look completely black?
And the answer is to his great surprise 

1494
01:07:24,631 --> 01:07:25,990
and still to hours,
no,

1495
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:30,100
it doesn't look completely black.
Even black holes when you look at them,

1496
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:35,400
will be seen to gradually emit photons 
to emit radiation very,

1497
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:37,060
very,
very slowly.

1498
01:07:37,830 --> 01:07:41,230
And how were you looking at them?
Like what method are you using this as a

1499
01:07:41,231 --> 01:07:45,520
thought experiment?
We've never seen this in the real world.

1500
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:50,550
The actual black holes we know about 
emit radiation so slowly there's no 

1501
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:54,781
practical way to actually observe it.
So this is entirely theoretical right 

1502
01:07:54,781 --> 01:07:54,781
now.

1503
01:07:54,781 --> 01:07:56,950
So.
But if it is entirely theoretical,

1504
01:07:56,951 --> 01:08:00,820
how do you measure that?
They're not entirely black.

1505
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:06,300
We haven't been able to do that.
We predict that they're not entirely 

1506
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:06,300
black,
but we've never verified that prediction

1507
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:06,790
yet.
You're freaking me out,

1508
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:07,980
man.
All this a lot.

1509
01:08:08,030 --> 01:08:10,780
A lot of physics is making predictions 
that we can't get past,

1510
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:13,210
but someday we're hoping.
But why even assume that?

1511
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:18,240
I mean,
I don't understand what the motivation 

1512
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:18,240
for assuming that they're not entirely 
black.

1513
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:18,770
It's not an assumption.
It is.

1514
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:23,450
If you believe what we think is already 
true about general relativity,

1515
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:26,390
the curvature of space,
time and quantum mechanics,

1516
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:31,720
then hawking says it.
It follows from those assumptions that 

1517
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:32,900
black holes are not completely black.
they give off radiation.

1518
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:37,640
Okay?
Now what about the theory?

1519
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:40,070
And then I've heard this fairly 
recently,

1520
01:08:40,071 --> 01:08:45,071
that there is potentially another 
universe inside of a black hole that as 

1521
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:50,921
you go into a black hole,
you may in fact be going into another 

1522
01:08:50,921 --> 01:08:55,541
universe that's filled with hundreds of 
millions of galaxies that have hundreds 

1523
01:08:55,640 --> 01:09:00,640
of millions of black holes to the center
and perhaps hundreds of millions of 

1524
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:00,640
universes inside of them,
right?

1525
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,330
Uh,
it's possible,

1526
01:09:02,331 --> 01:09:03,740
which again,
as I said earlier,

1527
01:09:03,741 --> 01:09:05,930
is what you should always say in these 
circumstances.

1528
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:10,550
There's no reason to think it's likely,
but it's certainly conceivable that that

1529
01:09:10,551 --> 01:09:12,560
happens.
By the way,

1530
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:16,010
the journey would not be pain free.
When you look inside the black hole,

1531
01:09:16,011 --> 01:09:18,530
you would die or you'd be very,
very.

1532
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:23,770
The technical term is spaghetti 
[inaudible] because the gravitational 

1533
01:09:23,770 --> 01:09:26,000
pull is much stronger at your head than 
at your feet as you're diving headfirst.

1534
01:09:26,001 --> 01:09:30,410
So you will be pulled into a very thin 
nonliving with cannon ball,

1535
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:32,210
but that doesn't help.
Doesn't help.

1536
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:34,710
Did you go crazy when you saw that movie
interstellar where,

1537
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:37,280
you know,
it was a weird thing.

1538
01:09:37,281 --> 01:09:41,060
I actually know a lot about the 
backstory there because kip thorne,

1539
01:09:41,061 --> 01:09:42,410
who was,
who invented the idea,

1540
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:43,880
what is it?
My colleague at caltech.

1541
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:45,720
So,
um,

1542
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:50,800
If you know,
remember the movie or the book contact 

1543
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:50,800
carl sagan wrote that movie.

1544
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,850
So carl sagan,
it was a brilliant guy,

1545
01:09:52,851 --> 01:09:55,310
but he was not a physicist.
He was a planetary scientist.

1546
01:09:55,311 --> 01:09:57,080
He studied life on other planets and 
things.

1547
01:09:57,290 --> 01:10:02,290
So in his novel he had this idea,
he wanted his heroin a lie to get across

1548
01:10:03,021 --> 01:10:04,220
the galaxy very,
very quickly,

1549
01:10:04,221 --> 01:10:09,221
faster than the speed of light.
And so in the first draft he said she 

1550
01:10:09,221 --> 01:10:12,461
falls into a black hole and then she 
gets spit out somewhere else in the 

1551
01:10:12,461 --> 01:10:13,190
galaxy and he knew that that couldn't,
that's not exactly right,

1552
01:10:13,191 --> 01:10:18,191
but it didn't sound right.
So he called up his friend to kip 

1553
01:10:18,191 --> 01:10:19,180
thorne,
whose a very famous physicist at caltech

1554
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:24,190
who is,
by the way will be winning the nobel 

1555
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:24,890
prize and a couple months in october.
Is it rigged a.

1556
01:10:24,891 --> 01:10:29,891
No,
but it's just such an obvious choice 

1557
01:10:29,891 --> 01:10:31,660
for.
Because he also helped invent lego when 

1558
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:31,660
they discovered gravitational waves.

1559
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:33,670
And that's definitely gonna be worthy of
the nobel lego lego.

1560
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:34,580
Yes.
What's that?

1561
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:39,760
Uh,
do you remember hearing the 

1562
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:39,760
gravitational waves were detected a 
year,

1563
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:39,760
year and a half?
Yes.

1564
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:41,930
So lego is the observatory that did 
that.

1565
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,070
Oh,
okay.

1566
01:10:43,071 --> 01:10:45,400
So that's his law,
the observatory.

1567
01:10:45,401 --> 01:10:47,720
So he was one of the other,
one of the moving pieces,

1568
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:53,110
moving forces behind that.
So gravitational waves were some 

1569
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:54,500
theoretical thing that's now been proven
to be real.

1570
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:59,590
That's right.
Big announcement about the new 

1571
01:10:59,590 --> 01:10:59,590
gravitational waves from ligo might 
become.

1572
01:10:59,590 --> 01:11:02,060
And yet that was August 24th.
Pretty recent one hour ago.

1573
01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:03,880
Oh yeah,
I know what it is.

1574
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:05,240
Whew.
So there's another.

1575
01:11:05,290 --> 01:11:06,500
I know.
What is it?

1576
01:11:06,501 --> 01:11:07,500
Tell us.
Can you tell us?

1577
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:12,640
Um,
I can tell you because it's on the 

1578
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:12,640
internet because I don't want to tell 
you because it's,

1579
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,880
I should let lego tell you,
and this is a rumor,

1580
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:17,280
but I,
I would just say stay tuned.

1581
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:20,670
When we saw,
when we saw last year,

1582
01:11:20,671 --> 01:11:25,671
the announcement was black holes were 
spiraling into each other and giving off

1583
01:11:26,371 --> 01:11:28,770
gravitational waves and that's what we 
saw.

1584
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:29,960
Okay.
That's,

1585
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:32,490
that was the source of the gravitational
waves that we saw.

1586
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:38,060
This news story is about neutron stars 
spiraling into each other or spiraling 

1587
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:38,970
into something.
I don't even know the details.

1588
01:11:38,971 --> 01:11:43,971
They just a rumor,
but it's a different source for the 

1589
01:11:43,971 --> 01:11:44,940
gravitational waves than we had before.
Here it is beyond black holes.

1590
01:11:44,941 --> 01:11:49,941
Could lego have detected merging neutron
stars for the first time now merging 

1591
01:11:49,981 --> 01:11:54,060
meaning like this infinitely slow pace 
that you're sort of measuring.

1592
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:55,810
Nobody's very fast.
Very fast.

1593
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:57,760
It takes seconds once,
once they're.

1594
01:11:57,810 --> 01:11:59,040
Once they're together.
Yeah.

1595
01:11:59,041 --> 01:12:04,041
Once they were very,
very close and emitting gravitational 

1596
01:12:04,041 --> 01:12:04,041
waves you can observe.
Wow.

1597
01:12:04,041 --> 01:12:04,550
And the exciting thing is,
okay,

1598
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:09,770
once black holes can merge,
why not neutron stars the differences 

1599
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:13,180
that black holes,
despite everything I just said them 

1600
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:14,130
about not being completely black,
are pretty darn black.

1601
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:19,550
so you see gravitational waves,
but you don't see them in your regular 

1602
01:12:19,550 --> 01:12:19,920
telescope.
With neutron stars,

1603
01:12:19,921 --> 01:12:22,980
there's a chance you can just see them 
as well as detect the gravitational.

1604
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:26,850
Now neutron stars,
now when they're doing this,

1605
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:31,910
you know we're,
we're talking about like how far away 

1606
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:31,910
are we observing this?
Oh,

1607
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:33,240
I don't know.
Usually millions of light years.

1608
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:38,870
Wow.
So anything you're observing happened 

1609
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:38,870
millions of years ago.
Yep,

1610
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:39,960
that's right.
Jesus.

1611
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:44,720
That's the.
That's one of the bigger mindfox.

1612
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:49,760
It's hard to get your head around when 
you look it up in the sky and you're 

1613
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:49,800
seeing something that's a million light 
years away.

1614
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:51,870
Yeah.
When you're looking through a telescope,

1615
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:54,480
you're seeing something that might not 
even be there anymore.

1616
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:55,350
Oh yeah.
Well,

1617
01:12:55,351 --> 01:13:00,351
in this case,
you know it's not because it gave off 

1618
01:13:00,351 --> 01:13:00,351
one of the biggest explosions in the 
universe.

1619
01:13:00,351 --> 01:13:03,090
Then that's what you're seeing.
The aftermath of those neutron stars are

1620
01:13:03,091 --> 01:13:04,020
no longer around.

1621
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:06,210
If they're,
if they're that it might've made a black

1622
01:13:06,211 --> 01:13:07,860
hole,
there might be some black hole remnant.

1623
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:09,670
Wow.
Yeah.

1624
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:12,920
If we've observed the birth of a black 
hole for um,

1625
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:18,050
I don't think we've observed the birth.
We've observed one big black hole being 

1626
01:13:18,050 --> 01:13:18,560
made out of two smaller ones.
That's a leg.

1627
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,100
That's what lego saw,
right?

1628
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:25,180
They actually observed it taking place.
It depends on the definition of 

1629
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:25,180
observed.
We know That it happened.

1630
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:26,470
Yeah.
From the gravitational wave.

1631
01:13:26,471 --> 01:13:26,860
Sacred.
Sure.

1632
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:28,200
That we observed.
Okay.

1633
01:13:28,201 --> 01:13:33,201
So you have a signature that is 
undeniably the evidence of this.

1634
01:13:34,341 --> 01:13:39,341
Now this one,
I don't know the details here with a 

1635
01:13:39,341 --> 01:13:39,341
neutron stars,
but they're,

1636
01:13:39,341 --> 01:13:40,440
they might be able to say there is no 
black hole left behind.

1637
01:13:40,441 --> 01:13:41,820
I don't know.
I'd be surprised.

1638
01:13:41,821 --> 01:13:45,120
That sounds very precise.
Very unrealistic.

1639
01:13:45,121 --> 01:13:47,880
But that's the kind of thing we would 
hope to be able to say someday.

1640
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:49,560
I've seen that on drugs.
This thing.

1641
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:51,470
Yeah.
You're showing if you take dmt,

1642
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:53,640
you can see that.
So what is this?

1643
01:13:53,641 --> 01:13:58,641
Uh,
this is the animated depiction of these 

1644
01:13:58,641 --> 01:13:59,220
two black holes spiraling into each 
other.

1645
01:13:59,221 --> 01:14:04,221
And because this is another one of my 
caltech colleagues that do need to get 

1646
01:14:04,221 --> 01:14:06,150
outside and it looks like he's just been
buried in books,

1647
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:08,820
then we wouldn't get good physics and 
those people went outside.

1648
01:14:08,821 --> 01:14:11,550
Don't let him outside little bit.
StAy inside that a lIttle bit,

1649
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:16,560
buddy.
Kid outside of some pictures don't make 

1650
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:17,410
themselves,
I'm sure.

1651
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:18,670
No,
I'm sure they delegate.

1652
01:14:18,671 --> 01:14:20,830
He's got this fish on the wall,
he's losing his mind.

1653
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:23,110
He's drawn fish.
Um,

1654
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:28,590
when like when you try to make these 
visual representations of something that

1655
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:34,060
is like,
essentially you're,

1656
01:14:34,061 --> 01:14:36,340
you're,
you're only interpreting,

1657
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:41,370
you're getting the gravitational wave,
you're getting the information that 

1658
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:44,671
data.
And then you try to make a visual 

1659
01:14:44,671 --> 01:14:44,980
representation of this thing that's for 
the general public,

1660
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:45,100
right?

1661
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:46,740
It's not basically not really for you 
guys.

1662
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:51,750
That's right.
So if you could also though see the 

1663
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:53,800
event happened using visible light or 
using your regular telescopes,

1664
01:14:53,801 --> 01:14:55,420
that will give you enormously more 
information.

1665
01:14:55,421 --> 01:14:56,650
So that's always a good thing to aim 
for.

1666
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,670
So as they do like this,
uh,

1667
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:01,900
this array that they're putting together
in Chile and all these different,

1668
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:07,440
new,
more advanced super telescope are 

1669
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,961
raised,
they're trying to get more and more 

1670
01:15:09,961 --> 01:15:13,440
actual visual information so that people
could see this stuff or something.

1671
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:14,540
Something.
I mean,

1672
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:19,030
there's a lot.
It's much easier to detect light than it

1673
01:15:19,031 --> 01:15:21,940
is to detect gravitational waves.
So this is the sound.

1674
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:27,600
This is the actual gravitational wave 
from the early detection's,

1675
01:15:27,641 --> 01:15:31,660
the first ones we got last year.
So this is lygo hanford on top,

1676
01:15:31,661 --> 01:15:34,810
and lego livingston.
Is this the actual sound?

1677
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:39,090
There is no actual sound.
They translate it into sound.

1678
01:15:39,090 --> 01:15:41,980
It's a gravitational wave that they 
said,

1679
01:15:41,981 --> 01:15:46,981
well,
what if it were a sound wave instead of 

1680
01:15:46,981 --> 01:15:46,981
gravitational waves?
This is how it would sound so confused.

1681
01:15:46,981 --> 01:15:50,880
And I was watching a documentary and 
they were talking about hyper novas and 

1682
01:15:53,351 --> 01:15:58,351
uh,
they were talking about the initial 

1683
01:15:58,351 --> 01:15:58,351
discovery of hyper novis that they 
detected this gamma radiation,

1684
01:15:58,351 --> 01:16:02,620
these bursts in the sky.
And they originally had one working 

1685
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:06,530
theory that there was some sort of an 
alien war going on right now.

1686
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:08,830
Always do that.
Like astronomers,

1687
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:12,940
bless their hearts,
they are happy to at least contemplate.

1688
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:16,060
Some of them are way out speculations 
like when pulse ours,

1689
01:16:16,061 --> 01:16:19,570
which are just spinning neutron stars.
When they were first detected,

1690
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,330
they were called lgm for little green 
men because they were these very,

1691
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:26,380
very regular pulses and people say what 
could it be alien?

1692
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:32,160
Right.
It's sort of not like one of those 

1693
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,800
planets that we've observed recently had
something that was orbiting it and they 

1694
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:39,391
were trying to figure out if it was some
enormous space station that was causing 

1695
01:16:39,391 --> 01:16:39,400
this.

1696
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:39,840
Well,
there was,

1697
01:16:39,841 --> 01:16:42,670
yeah,
there's a something that got labeled the

1698
01:16:42,671 --> 01:16:47,671
alien mega structure,
which is basically like something that 

1699
01:16:47,671 --> 01:16:48,640
is bigger and colder than you would 
expect,

1700
01:16:48,641 --> 01:16:49,970
but maybe if it were,
you know,

1701
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:53,110
some structure surrounding a star,
that's what it would look like.

1702
01:16:53,111 --> 01:16:56,770
And I wouldn't bet on that.
I don't think that's the reasonable.

1703
01:16:57,390 --> 01:16:58,990
Whenever I read something like that,
I'm like,

1704
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:00,400
oh,
they just want funding.

1705
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:02,980
They just want to get people excited.
You don't get any funding for that.

1706
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,200
No anti get funding for that.
For really.

1707
01:17:05,201 --> 01:17:07,270
For an alien mega star.
Yeah.

1708
01:17:07,271 --> 01:17:09,380
Because the people giving you funding or
your fellow scientists

1709
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:13,070
taking cheap thrills rather than being 
serious.

1710
01:17:13,071 --> 01:17:18,071
So what you Do is you get hits for your 
website and you might not necessarily 

1711
01:17:18,071 --> 01:17:21,590
like when you're going through some of 
these websites that science websites for

1712
01:17:21,591 --> 01:17:26,420
the most part really straightforward 
sort of titles to their articles.

1713
01:17:26,421 --> 01:17:29,300
But occasionally you get a little click 
baity oh yeah.

1714
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:31,800
With some stomaCh women.
Human beings,

1715
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:35,420
they would like little more likes on 
their juice it up a little bit.

1716
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:39,240
Get people excited.
Yeah.

1717
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:44,520
Um,
so when they first initially discovered 

1718
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:48,580
this,
these gamma ray bursts and they thought 

1719
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:49,030
there was some sort of an alien war 
going,

1720
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,080
going on in space.
Um,

1721
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:53,030
I mean there's,
I mean,

1722
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:55,130
so far,
nothing,

1723
01:17:55,160 --> 01:18:00,160
right?
So far there's no detectable evidence 

1724
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:01,250
whatsoever of anything out there other 
than us.

1725
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:03,110
That's right.
But wheN the thing,

1726
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:04,730
if there is,
I mean when an,

1727
01:18:04,731 --> 01:18:05,330
if.
Right.

1728
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:10,390
If the thing comes,
if one day we get some sort of 

1729
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:11,420
undeniable signal,
whatever it is,

1730
01:18:11,421 --> 01:18:15,200
or we see something or how does that get
processed?

1731
01:18:15,201 --> 01:18:18,200
Like do you have to go like straight to 
president trump and go,

1732
01:18:18,201 --> 01:18:20,060
hey man,
I would not do that.

1733
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:25,090
No,
that's not what I would do is like saY 

1734
01:18:25,090 --> 01:18:25,970
if it was one of your colleagues

1735
01:18:26,170 --> 01:18:27,460
though.
There is a procedure.

1736
01:18:27,930 --> 01:18:32,930
It's not even very well publicized as 
far as I know procedure or like a more 

1737
01:18:34,950 --> 01:18:36,790
self appointed.
I think it's like,

1738
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:37,990
you know,
people have said,

1739
01:18:37,991 --> 01:18:40,120
all right,
we are the alien detection network.

1740
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:42,840
You might be able to keep your mouth 
shut if you like.

1741
01:18:42,850 --> 01:18:45,730
People can't handle this shit.
Well I think it's,

1742
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:49,330
I think that we're not very realistic 
about these.

1743
01:18:49,331 --> 01:18:51,340
I think that it could happen.
Um,

1744
01:18:51,370 --> 01:18:56,370
but we're just like with quantum 
mechanics or artificial intelligence or 

1745
01:18:56,370 --> 01:19:00,571
whatever,
we tend to put everything in the frame 

1746
01:19:00,571 --> 01:19:00,760
of what we're immediately used to.
Right?

1747
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:04,360
So we can redeem out radio signals into 
space.

1748
01:19:04,420 --> 01:19:05,920
We're really good at that.
Right?

1749
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:10,540
So we tend to think that aliens will 
either be discovered or actually contact

1750
01:19:10,541 --> 01:19:15,541
us by beaming radio signals and us.
But that's a hOrrendously wasteful way 

1751
01:19:15,541 --> 01:19:17,680
to do interstellar communication.

1752
01:19:17,730 --> 01:19:19,690
Right?
For one thing,

1753
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:24,460
radio waves move at the speed of light.
So imagine you're a thousand light years

1754
01:19:24,461 --> 01:19:29,461
away,
you have no idea what's going on on 

1755
01:19:29,461 --> 01:19:29,461
earth,
but you say,

1756
01:19:29,461 --> 01:19:29,461
well,
there's a.

1757
01:19:29,461 --> 01:19:31,240
It's a promising location for life to 
arise.

1758
01:19:31,241 --> 01:19:33,220
I know wHat I'll do,
I'll beam a signal at them.

1759
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:34,930
Well,
how long are you going to be mad?

1760
01:19:34,931 --> 01:19:36,970
You're going to turn the telescope on 
for a month.

1761
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:40,930
Then in the whole history of humankind,
they better be listening the exact right

1762
01:19:40,931 --> 01:19:42,280
month.
Otherwise they're not going to hear it.

1763
01:19:42,730 --> 01:19:47,730
It's actually way more efficient to send
a spacecraft eVen though it's much 

1764
01:19:47,730 --> 01:19:48,010
slower.
That's okay.

1765
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:53,360
You have plenty of time.
Send a space craft and park it in the 

1766
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:57,181
system that you want to know about and 
then wait for life to arise in that 

1767
01:19:57,181 --> 01:19:57,970
system.
So honestly,

1768
01:19:57,971 --> 01:20:00,130
if we're going to detect evidence for 
aliens,

1769
01:20:00,131 --> 01:20:05,131
it's much more likely we're gonna find a
monolith on the moon or something like 

1770
01:20:05,131 --> 01:20:07,951
that.
Then we're going to hear them in our 

1771
01:20:07,951 --> 01:20:07,951
telescopes.
A monolith.

1772
01:20:07,951 --> 01:20:08,090
The moon wasn't

1773
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:09,720
that 2001,
right?

1774
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:14,780
But wasn't that something that uh,
one of the astronauts said they saw 

1775
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:16,560
something up there.
Some of those astronauts have lost their

1776
01:20:16,561 --> 01:20:18,810
mind as they got older and I've always 
wondered,

1777
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:24,230
like edgar mitchell's the big one,
he's the one who says he's seen some 

1778
01:20:24,230 --> 01:20:27,000
things that aliens are real and I always
wonder,

1779
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:30,330
are those guys getting crazy as they get
older or they're going,

1780
01:20:30,331 --> 01:20:31,500
look,
I got to get some money.

1781
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:33,450
I need some.
I need some attention.

1782
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:36,390
What's the best way to do it?
It happened to that alien market.

1783
01:20:36,391 --> 01:20:39,390
That alien market's a big market.
They could be perfectly sincere,

1784
01:20:39,391 --> 01:20:44,391
but look the way you want when you pick 
who's going to be an astronaut is 

1785
01:20:44,391 --> 01:20:44,610
someone who can fly the spacecraft bank,
right?

1786
01:20:44,910 --> 01:20:49,910
They don't need to have good judgment 
about whether or not they're aliens up 

1787
01:20:49,910 --> 01:20:49,910
there.
That's not what you're goIng for.

1788
01:20:49,910 --> 01:20:54,510
You.
they just need to have an understanding 

1789
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:54,510
of what the task is and how they're 
gonna perform it.

1790
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:57,030
Yeah.
Edgar miTchell was a he.

1791
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:59,040
I think he might've passed away 
recently.

1792
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:04,220
Did he pass away,
but he's one of those guys that people 

1793
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:06,330
always bring up when I'm not a believer 
necessarily in.

1794
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:09,180
Not that I'm not a believer in alien 
life,

1795
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:13,470
but I'm not believer in anY of the 
people that say they've seen aliens.

1796
01:21:13,471 --> 01:21:18,471
Are you juSt.
I did a show for psi phi and one of the 

1797
01:21:18,471 --> 01:21:23,031
episodes we did,
we spent weeks talking to people that 

1798
01:21:23,031 --> 01:21:25,080
are ufo researchers and studying the air
quote evidence,

1799
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,470
right,
and there's nothing there like be a good

1800
01:21:28,471 --> 01:21:30,930
basie and if someone sees some flashing 
lights in the sky,

1801
01:21:30,931 --> 01:21:35,190
what is more likely alien civilization 
or they're not accurately reporting what

1802
01:21:35,191 --> 01:21:37,350
they saw,
like eye witness testimony is terrible,

1803
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:39,360
terrible,
terrible in this specialty,

1804
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:40,890
in these weird cases.

1805
01:21:40,890 --> 01:21:42,030
Yeah.
IT's just very,

1806
01:21:42,031 --> 01:21:43,140
very dismissible.
So.

1807
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:48,320
Right.
And you want to keep an open mind 

1808
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,331
because if there was a unique event 
where an alien spacecraft did enter our 

1809
01:21:51,031 --> 01:21:53,370
atmosphere and observe us and then take 
off,

1810
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:57,060
it would be quite fascinating.
If you could actually get a good read on

1811
01:21:57,061 --> 01:22:02,061
some more.
I think it'd be hugely important to the 

1812
01:22:02,061 --> 01:22:02,061
history of life on earth,
right?

1813
01:22:02,061 --> 01:22:03,370
Like human history.
If we won,

1814
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:08,680
if and when we finally discover 
intelligent life out there somewhere 

1815
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:12,261
else,
that will be one of the most important 

1816
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:12,261
events in our history.
The idea that it's a,

1817
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:16,800
you know,
a 20 foot long flying saucer that comes 

1818
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,810
and visits you in,
in Wyoming is not very plausible.

1819
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:22,260
well also the idea of physical beings on
board.

1820
01:22:22,261 --> 01:22:25,090
this thing seems counterintuitive.
Like why?

1821
01:22:25,091 --> 01:22:28,110
Why would they do that?
Like we don't have to do that anymore.

1822
01:22:28,230 --> 01:22:31,020
Like we send the mars rover up there,
we get amazing footage.

1823
01:22:31,021 --> 01:22:32,850
It stays up there forever.
It doesn't need food.

1824
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,470
Exactly.
So that's what they'll do.

1825
01:22:34,471 --> 01:22:35,880
They'll send a rover here.
Not a.

1826
01:22:35,970 --> 01:22:39,930
Not a either a person or a radio wave.
That's what I would imagine.

1827
01:22:39,931 --> 01:22:43,140
I would imagine it would be.
Obviously I don't know what the fuck I'm

1828
01:22:43,141 --> 01:22:44,490
parked.
So if you're getting mad right now,

1829
01:22:44,491 --> 01:22:46,380
I get rid of the aliens.
That's okay.

1830
01:22:46,381 --> 01:22:51,381
I would just assume that it would be 
some super complicated drone and what 

1831
01:22:51,740 --> 01:22:52,470
they would.
Yeah,

1832
01:22:52,471 --> 01:22:55,230
they would try to just take data,
observe,

1833
01:22:55,260 --> 01:23:00,260
maybe get some sort of a visual 
understanding and obviously with the 

1834
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:03,681
kind of telescopes that we have,
like the [inaudible] eight when they 

1835
01:23:03,681 --> 01:23:04,350
were 22,000
miles out,

1836
01:23:04,351 --> 01:23:09,351
we take these incredible high resolution
detailed video and photographs of the 

1837
01:23:09,581 --> 01:23:12,040
earth itself.
What kind of shit to the aliens.

1838
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,200
they probably don't need to get anywhere
near us.

1839
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:15,450
Right?
Yeah.

1840
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:16,280
Imagine that

1841
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:18,270
weird thing is there.
You know,

1842
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:21,270
the fermi paradox,
they should be here already,

1843
01:23:21,370 --> 01:23:26,370
right?
Like the solar system should be buzzing 

1844
01:23:26,370 --> 01:23:28,431
with these drones and either a.
Well almost certainly it's not because 

1845
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:32,260
it's not clear why they would try to 
hide from us really.

1846
01:23:32,310 --> 01:23:34,620
And if they don't try to hide,
they'd be easily noticeable.

1847
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:39,570
So there's something we don't understand
about life in the universe either.

1848
01:23:39,571 --> 01:23:44,571
it's much more rare than we might guess 
or for some reason it's not very 

1849
01:23:44,571 --> 01:23:47,100
gregarious that doesn't go and visit the
rest of the stars in the galaxy.

1850
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:53,340
My thought was,
and this is a obviously a very 

1851
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:56,290
controversial thought,
but no one wants to think that we're the

1852
01:23:56,291 --> 01:23:57,650
first.
Right.

1853
01:23:57,670 --> 01:23:58,420
That's like,
well,

1854
01:23:58,421 --> 01:24:00,730
if there's us,
then there's probably more right,

1855
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:05,470
maybe right,
but maybe it has to happen once.

1856
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:08,950
Some it has to happen for the first time
somewhere,

1857
01:24:09,190 --> 01:24:10,070
right?
Like this,

1858
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:15,330
like a single celled organism had to 
become a multicell organism and had to 

1859
01:24:15,330 --> 01:24:18,970
take place through mutation and it had 
to take place at one point in time.

1860
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:23,440
Will that time on this planet,
at least it was the first time was one,

1861
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:25,360
one point eight mil billions of years 
ago.

1862
01:24:25,361 --> 01:24:27,740
Right?
Why do we have this?

1863
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:33,510
We know that we are the only thing 
that's ever done that as far as we know 

1864
01:24:33,510 --> 01:24:37,411
here,
so why would we assume that anything 

1865
01:24:37,411 --> 01:24:37,411
else that we might be the tip of the 
spear?

1866
01:24:37,411 --> 01:24:38,680
It's completely possible,
I think,

1867
01:24:38,681 --> 01:24:42,580
and it's also possible that we're.
That life happens all the time,

1868
01:24:42,581 --> 01:24:44,710
but it never becomes multicellular or 
intelligent.

1869
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:45,470
Mm,
right.

1870
01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:47,790
Or becomes intelligent,
but never build spaceships.

1871
01:24:47,830 --> 01:24:49,420
There's many,
many ways it could happen,

1872
01:24:49,421 --> 01:24:54,421
but yes,
we could be in the entire observable 

1873
01:24:54,421 --> 01:24:57,001
universe.
The only spaceship building species 

1874
01:24:57,001 --> 01:24:57,001
right now.

1875
01:24:57,001 --> 01:24:59,730
Well,
we also have this weird way of defining 

1876
01:24:59,730 --> 01:25:00,370
intelligence by the ability to change 
your atmosphere,

1877
01:25:00,371 --> 01:25:02,110
your environment,
or your to,

1878
01:25:02,170 --> 01:25:04,030
to,
to build things like,

1879
01:25:04,031 --> 01:25:07,330
that's what we think of as intelligent,
whereas dolphins are obviously extremely

1880
01:25:07,331 --> 01:25:12,331
intelligent,
but they don't really impact their 

1881
01:25:12,331 --> 01:25:12,790
environment much at all other than 
biological life,

1882
01:25:12,791 --> 01:25:15,610
like eating things and waste and things 
along those lines.

1883
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:17,110
But they don't build structures.
They don't,

1884
01:25:17,450 --> 01:25:18,980
they don't keep records,
they don't.

1885
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,470
And we live in a weird planet that is 
roughly,

1886
01:25:21,471 --> 01:25:26,471
you know,
I'm a comparable proportion of land to 

1887
01:25:26,471 --> 01:25:26,471
ocean,
right?

1888
01:25:26,630 --> 01:25:29,830
Be very easy to imagine planets that 
were all ocean that,

1889
01:25:29,950 --> 01:25:33,380
that the dolphins were the apex 
predators and that was right.

1890
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:34,400
And so,
uh,

1891
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:37,220
just got really smart,
really good at eating fish.

1892
01:25:37,370 --> 01:25:38,240
Yup.
Yeah.

1893
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:40,580
They played games and whistled songs and
that was great.

1894
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:44,930
Yeah.
Well also the idea that life only has to

1895
01:25:44,931 --> 01:25:47,540
exist in this goldilocks zone has always
been weird to me.

1896
01:25:47,630 --> 01:25:48,240
Oh yeah.
No,

1897
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:49,220
very strange.
Also,

1898
01:25:49,221 --> 01:25:54,221
I don't know,
one that we're already finding 

1899
01:25:54,221 --> 01:25:54,221
exceptions to that,
right?

1900
01:25:54,221 --> 01:25:54,950
Like even here in the solar system,
uh,

1901
01:25:54,951 --> 01:25:57,890
you wouldn't necessarily look to earth 
first if you didn't already know,

1902
01:25:58,370 --> 01:26:01,430
uh,
the moons of jupiter and saturn are very

1903
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:03,710
plausible places to look for the of 
life,

1904
01:26:03,711 --> 01:26:03,980
even though

1905
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:06,530
they're outside the goldilocks zone 
because it's just different conditions.

1906
01:26:06,531 --> 01:26:11,531
So I think we should be very,
very open minded about the conditions 

1907
01:26:11,531 --> 01:26:11,800
around other stars where life could 
form.

1908
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:16,960
Yeah.
I mean we find weird life at the bottom 

1909
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:18,260
of oceans and volcanic events insanely 
hot.

1910
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:22,400
And they find these,
these life forms that are able to thrive

1911
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:25,730
in those conditions that would kill 
almost everything else.

1912
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:26,560
Yeah.
Yeah.

1913
01:26:26,561 --> 01:26:27,560
Yeah.
And part of that is,

1914
01:26:27,561 --> 01:26:28,190
you know,
it's,

1915
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:29,780
I think that the response to that would 
be,

1916
01:26:29,781 --> 01:26:34,100
well,
life started in fairly benign conditions

1917
01:26:34,101 --> 01:26:36,560
and then evolved to survive in these 
harsher conditions.

1918
01:26:36,561 --> 01:26:41,561
But I just think that our ability to 
understand chemistry and biology is not 

1919
01:26:41,561 --> 01:26:45,101
that good.
Especially hypothetical speculative 

1920
01:26:45,101 --> 01:26:47,831
chemistry and biology.
We should be very humble about saying 

1921
01:26:47,831 --> 01:26:48,010
how life needs to be on other planets.
Right?

1922
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:53,040
We always assume that it has to have 
water and it has to get carbon based 

1923
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:53,040
and,
and maybe that's right,

1924
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:53,600
but we can't say that we know.

1925
01:26:53,870 --> 01:26:56,270
Right.
Did you ever go through a period in life

1926
01:26:56,271 --> 01:26:59,090
where you were obsessed?
Are fascinated by aliens?

1927
01:26:59,810 --> 01:27:00,800
Yeah.
When I was a kid,

1928
01:27:00,830 --> 01:27:03,710
uh,
I certainly not only aliens,

1929
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:06,890
but psychic powers and all this stuff.
I was very,

1930
01:27:06,891 --> 01:27:07,580
uh,
you know,

1931
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:12,760
interested in all the cool stuff and I 
became more and more scientific as I 

1932
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:17,201
aged and yeah,
those are weird things that are somehow 

1933
01:27:17,201 --> 01:27:18,070
or another linked together because 
they're,

1934
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:21,500
I don't want to be mean in saying this,
but they're bullshit.

1935
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:26,750
You know,
like the psychic powers are aliens and 

1936
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:29,060
when you bring up the fact that it's 
very likely these things are bullshit.

1937
01:27:29,270 --> 01:27:34,270
People get very upset.
Like you're taking away their santa 

1938
01:27:34,270 --> 01:27:34,700
claus.
I don't know.

1939
01:27:34,701 --> 01:27:38,870
There's a video I saw literally this 
morning on the web of the.

1940
01:27:38,871 --> 01:27:43,871
These people stood outside a little mark
on the corner of a street in New York 

1941
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:47,240
where people were buying power ball 
tickets.

1942
01:27:47,630 --> 01:27:50,090
Okay?
So people buy powerball tickets and it's

1943
01:27:50,091 --> 01:27:53,300
like 10 bucks.
And they come out and they were offered,

1944
01:27:53,510 --> 01:27:58,510
can I buy your power ball ticket from 
you for $20 for twice what you paid for 

1945
01:27:58,510 --> 01:28:00,560
it and 11 out of the 14 people that I 
said,

1946
01:28:00,561 --> 01:28:01,820
no,
I'm holding onto my ticket.

1947
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Right.
Because they thought that this ticket 

1948
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,270
was the winter and they're like,
this is $700,000,000

1949
01:28:08,271 --> 01:28:10,040
that I'd be given you for $20.
Right.

1950
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:12,920
With no rational justification.
But they,

1951
01:28:12,921 --> 01:28:13,640
you know,
it's,

1952
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:16,760
it's in some sense innocent.
If you just.

1953
01:28:16,761 --> 01:28:21,761
Okay,
you're wishful thinking about your own 

1954
01:28:21,761 --> 01:28:21,761
little ticket,
that's fine.

1955
01:28:21,761 --> 01:28:23,440
But it leads us to be not completely 
rational and planning our futures.

1956
01:28:23,450 --> 01:28:28,450
Yeah.
I'm with the people that won't take the 

1957
01:28:28,450 --> 01:28:28,450
20.
Is that a role it come on?

1958
01:28:28,450 --> 01:28:31,700
I mean it might go in and buy two more 
tickets yet with the 20 would just be 20

1959
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,320
and it would just be $20.

1960
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:38,320
Now you can go,
but you might have in your possession 

1961
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:39,310
you might the ticket or it might be the 
next one.

1962
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:42,050
But what if you give it to them?
Give them the ticket,

1963
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:44,030
you get to 20,
you go buy some users tickets.

1964
01:28:44,031 --> 01:28:46,850
And turns out the ticket you gave them 
was 700 million bucks.

1965
01:28:46,990 --> 01:28:50,250
You've got to jump off a roof.
And what if the one you buy is the worst

1966
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:55,390
one?
The one that when you're a glass half 

1967
01:28:55,390 --> 01:28:55,390
full kind of guy,
aren't you?

1968
01:28:55,390 --> 01:28:56,050
The probabilities work out,
you know,

1969
01:28:56,060 --> 01:29:01,060
it doesn't really matter.
You don't know what the number is going 

1970
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:01,060
to be.
Right?

1971
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:02,080
But that the randomness of it all,
what gets people like

1972
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:02,910
panicky,
right?

1973
01:29:02,911 --> 01:29:05,460
Like what if,
what if it could be,

1974
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:07,110
I mean,
the best way to,

1975
01:29:07,940 --> 01:29:08,270
you know,

1976
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:11,450
calibrate your odds of winning the 
powerball or saying,

1977
01:29:11,451 --> 01:29:13,370
you know,
just play the numbers.

1978
01:29:13,371 --> 01:29:14,030
One,
two,

1979
01:29:14,031 --> 01:29:14,720
three,
four,

1980
01:29:14,721 --> 01:29:15,530
five,
six.

1981
01:29:15,531 --> 01:29:17,330
And people were like,
well that's never going to come up.

1982
01:29:17,710 --> 01:29:19,450
You're like,
actually the probability of that kind of

1983
01:29:19,540 --> 01:29:22,010
is the same as any other one that you're
going to pick.

1984
01:29:22,330 --> 01:29:24,720
Huh?
Doesn't matter what it was.

1985
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:26,890
Just random.
Now,

1986
01:29:27,610 --> 01:29:32,610
have you ever read anything compelling 
at all that leads you to think that 

1987
01:29:32,681 --> 01:29:37,681
maybe somebody might have observed 
something that could potentially have 

1988
01:29:37,681 --> 01:29:39,070
been something from another planet or 
some sort of.

1989
01:29:39,660 --> 01:29:40,770
No,
I don't think so.

1990
01:29:40,771 --> 01:29:43,590
I mean,
I think that a astronomers do have a set

1991
01:29:43,591 --> 01:29:45,390
of things that they don't understand 
very well.

1992
01:29:45,391 --> 01:29:48,330
The most recent example are these things
called fast radio bursts,

1993
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:50,130
which are a little bit different than 
the gamma burst,

1994
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:52,160
gamma ray bursts,
but you know,

1995
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,420
as always,
the more we think about it,

1996
01:29:54,421 --> 01:29:55,170
the more we say,
oh,

1997
01:29:55,171 --> 01:30:00,171
actually I can come up with a perfectly 
plausible explanation for that is 

1998
01:30:00,171 --> 01:30:01,980
nothing to do with alien.
I'm going back to this sort of uploading

1999
01:30:01,981 --> 01:30:06,981
consciousness thing.
There's a very real possibility that 

2000
01:30:06,981 --> 01:30:08,220
once civilizations or intelligence pcs 
become sufficiently advanced,

2001
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:13,640
they upload themselves and they realize 
there's not really any motivation to go 

2002
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:14,280
exploring the universe and maybe die 
anymore.

2003
01:30:14,530 --> 01:30:16,570
Yeah.
That's what my thought would be,

2004
01:30:16,571 --> 01:30:20,260
that once civilizations get sufficiently
advanced,

2005
01:30:20,261 --> 01:30:25,261
they would go per virtual.
They would figure out a way to create 

2006
01:30:25,261 --> 01:30:28,360
these artificial universes to travel 
into that are probably just as complex,

2007
01:30:29,170 --> 01:30:34,170
if not more.
I think we have every right to imagine 

2008
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:34,170
that given them,
you know,

2009
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:34,690
so little about what it would be about 
right now.

2010
01:30:34,691 --> 01:30:39,691
Yeah.
But if we can create artificial 

2011
01:30:39,691 --> 01:30:39,691
intelligence to that is the very 
bizarre.

2012
01:30:39,691 --> 01:30:43,861
It's like if we can create artificial 
intelligence and somehow or another 

2013
01:30:43,861 --> 01:30:47,431
corral it into existing only in this 
virtual world that we've created,

2014
01:30:48,190 --> 01:30:53,190
and then inside this virtual world 
you're interacting with these 

2015
01:30:53,190 --> 01:30:54,160
artificially intelligent creatures that 
are disembodied,

2016
01:30:54,161 --> 01:30:59,161
right,
and then in this world you would give 

2017
01:30:59,161 --> 01:30:59,161
them some sort of a body and you would 
interact with them.

2018
01:30:59,270 --> 01:31:01,880
I think that again,
the thing that we under appreciate about

2019
01:31:01,881 --> 01:31:06,881
that is what is the motivation that 
these artificially intelligent entities 

2020
01:31:07,641 --> 01:31:10,070
would have?
Like we human beings like it or not,

2021
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:12,320
we get hungry.
We wouldn't have sex,

2022
01:31:12,321 --> 01:31:17,321
we wouldn't have power or whatever,
but like if you're just a virtual being 

2023
01:31:17,321 --> 01:31:21,191
in an environment without these 
energetic constraints or a need to eat 

2024
01:31:21,191 --> 01:31:23,450
and sleep and so forth,
why do you do anything at all?

2025
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:24,410
I don't know.
I mean,

2026
01:31:24,411 --> 01:31:26,810
why would.
I have no idea what the psychology would

2027
01:31:26,811 --> 01:31:28,010
be like for something like that.

2028
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:31,190
Did you see x mokena?
I did not.

2029
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:33,950
How dare you?
That's an amazing movie.

2030
01:31:33,951 --> 01:31:36,860
I saw it twice actually.
I think I saw three times.

2031
01:31:37,010 --> 01:31:38,810
It's really good.
I mean,

2032
01:31:38,811 --> 01:31:43,811
it is a very balanced take on potential 
artificial intelligence and someone 

2033
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:46,760
making it as you can see it really well 
made movie,

2034
01:31:46,970 --> 01:31:51,970
but you see the story that was sort of,
I don't want to give away too much of 

2035
01:31:51,970 --> 01:31:54,050
it,
but you see the struggle in these things

2036
01:31:54,051 --> 01:31:59,051
as this guy is interacting with these 
things and you see the struggle as 

2037
01:31:59,051 --> 01:31:59,950
they're to

2038
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:03,910
interpret what they are.
Right versus what he is.

2039
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:05,290
But they are in bodies,
right?

2040
01:32:05,291 --> 01:32:05,960
They're like,
yes,

2041
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:06,520
yes,
yes.

2042
01:32:06,670 --> 01:32:07,600
Yeah,
yeah.

2043
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,350
Gotta wonder like what?
I mean,

2044
01:32:10,420 --> 01:32:12,430
elon musk is terrified of this shit,
right?

2045
01:32:12,431 --> 01:32:17,431
I mean,
he said that we might be summoning the 

2046
01:32:17,431 --> 01:32:17,431
demon.
That's his exact quote.

2047
01:32:17,431 --> 01:32:17,431
Yeah.
Yeah.

2048
01:32:17,431 --> 01:32:20,140
And I get a trouble.
I tend to agree with him.

2049
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,050
Um,
and again,

2050
01:32:21,070 --> 01:32:23,260
to get in trouble on twitter for saying 
that I agree with him,

2051
01:32:23,261 --> 01:32:28,261
but because people who are actually 
doing artificial intelligence have this 

2052
01:32:28,261 --> 01:32:33,120
very real appreciation for how far away 
we are from something that you would 

2053
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,120
classify as intelligent in any real 
sense.

2054
01:32:34,121 --> 01:32:37,480
And so therefore from their day to day 
perspective,

2055
01:32:37,690 --> 01:32:42,190
the worry about superintelligent ai is 
taking over the world is laughable.

2056
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:45,180
But my argument,
and I think Illinois is that,

2057
01:32:45,250 --> 01:32:50,250
yeah,
but what is the percentage chance have 

2058
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:50,400
to be that this is going to happen 
before you start worrying about it,

2059
01:32:50,401 --> 01:32:51,850
if,
if the consequences,

2060
01:32:51,851 --> 01:32:54,170
really the ruination of the world,
right?

2061
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:59,400
There are only so many things that we do
for which the worst case scenario is 

2062
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:03,991
quite that bad.
That's what makes it a special 

2063
01:33:03,991 --> 01:33:05,650
circumstance and it might be very,
very unlikely,

2064
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:07,120
but are you willing to say like,
okay,

2065
01:33:07,121 --> 01:33:10,420
one percent chance that all human being 
destroyed?

2066
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:12,730
I don't think that's,
that's actually the worry,

2067
01:33:12,731 --> 01:33:15,550
but we should just do our due diligence,
right?

2068
01:33:15,551 --> 01:33:18,070
We should think about what the 
possibilities are.

2069
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:21,040
We should plan for them.
Probably no big deal.

2070
01:33:21,070 --> 01:33:23,650
When I said this on twitter,
people knowing that I was a physicist,

2071
01:33:23,651 --> 01:33:24,730
we're like,
well,

2072
01:33:24,790 --> 01:33:29,790
what did you think about people who are 
worried that the large hadron collider 

2073
01:33:29,790 --> 01:33:29,800
was gonna destroy the world?
Right?

2074
01:33:29,801 --> 01:33:30,190
I said,
well,

2075
01:33:30,191 --> 01:33:31,570
what do you mean?
Physicists did many,

2076
01:33:31,571 --> 01:33:34,480
many studies checking to see whether or 
not it would destroy the world.

2077
01:33:34,481 --> 01:33:39,481
We don't want to be destroyed anymore 
than anybody else and so I think that's 

2078
01:33:39,481 --> 01:33:39,580
a very sensible thing to do for 
artificial intelligence also.

2079
01:33:40,150 --> 01:33:40,960
yeah,
I agree.

2080
01:33:41,010 --> 01:33:45,670
It just when you see articles like did 
you see the recent article or the google

2081
01:33:45,671 --> 01:33:50,671
ai that they had to shut down because 
they were starting to communicate which 

2082
01:33:50,671 --> 01:33:54,480
with each other they invented.
That language was not very convincing.

2083
01:33:54,551 --> 01:33:56,140
If you ever saw it printed out,
I'm sure.

2084
01:33:56,141 --> 01:34:01,141
But to me that's,
that's like a scene in a horror movie 

2085
01:34:01,141 --> 01:34:03,010
where like,
and then you go to 10 know blank screen.

2086
01:34:03,011 --> 01:34:06,430
Ten years later we're all dressed up 
like mad max.

2087
01:34:06,431 --> 01:34:07,380
We fucking,
you know,

2088
01:34:07,450 --> 01:34:10,810
bandannas over our face and we're 
running from terminator bots.

2089
01:34:10,811 --> 01:34:12,400
So I think that's the thing,
you know again,

2090
01:34:12,401 --> 01:34:17,401
and again we're coming to this theme 
that our imaginations are not quite up 

2091
01:34:17,401 --> 01:34:20,731
to the task because our imaginations 
about superintelligent ai or something 

2092
01:34:20,731 --> 01:34:24,301
like that.
SomeThing frankensteined ask it just in 

2093
01:34:24,301 --> 01:34:27,121
robots or something like out of asimov,
but the I think much more realistic 

2094
01:34:27,731 --> 01:34:32,731
worry or things like currently existing 
neural networks and deep learning 

2095
01:34:32,921 --> 01:34:37,921
algorithms.
So basically there's all sorts of 

2096
01:34:37,921 --> 01:34:38,650
problems like pattern recognition,
facial recognition,

2097
01:34:38,651 --> 01:34:40,240
right?
We are very,

2098
01:34:40,241 --> 01:34:44,200
very bad at sitting down and writing a 
program that recognizes faces.

2099
01:34:44,310 --> 01:34:46,450
Human beings are not very good at 
figuring out how to do that,

2100
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:52,020
but we have ways of building programs 
that can teach themselves to recognize 

2101
01:34:52,661 --> 01:34:57,661
faces and they're amazingly good.
So we have programs like when you onto 

2102
01:34:57,661 --> 01:34:58,070
google or your

2103
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:02,840
itunes or whatever and you know your ifo
is recognizing your face.

2104
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:08,380
There is some neural net that is doing 
that and there is no human being alive 

2105
01:35:08,380 --> 01:35:12,431
that understands what it's doing.
All we know is that it's getting the 

2106
01:35:12,431 --> 01:35:12,431
right answer.
Okay.

2107
01:35:12,431 --> 01:35:16,040
And that can be.
That kind of logic can go very,

2108
01:35:16,041 --> 01:35:21,041
very far.
And so I'm not worried about like a 

2109
01:35:21,041 --> 01:35:23,861
robot like ultron taking over.
I'm worried about are all of our 

2110
01:35:23,861 --> 01:35:27,080
infrastructure being run by programs 
that no human being understands.

2111
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:27,900
whoa.

2112
01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:32,990
Oh,
that's something I hadn't even 

2113
01:35:32,990 --> 01:35:32,990
considered,
but yeah,

2114
01:35:32,990 --> 01:35:34,580
that's a real issue.
The real issue,

2115
01:35:34,610 --> 01:35:36,470
right?
That's an actual real thing.

2116
01:35:36,860 --> 01:35:41,860
I've always wondered whether or not what
human beings are doing with our insane 

2117
01:35:41,860 --> 01:35:46,721
lust to innovate and to constantly 
create new and more spectacular things 

2118
01:35:46,721 --> 01:35:49,310
and to always look for the next version 
of something.

2119
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:52,340
We're not satisfied with the iphone six.
We want the iphone seven.

2120
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:54,350
That's not a problem,
but that wednesday the eight come out.

2121
01:35:54,630 --> 01:35:57,800
We always have this intense desire for 
better things.

2122
01:35:57,950 --> 01:35:58,970
We don't.
I mean,

2123
01:35:58,971 --> 01:36:02,410
unless you're a classic car advocate or 
add a devote,

2124
01:36:02,470 --> 01:36:04,460
we really what you want is like,
oh,

2125
01:36:04,461 --> 01:36:07,360
this new car stops faster at handles,
better,

2126
01:36:07,820 --> 01:36:12,820
accelerates quicker.
We always want things to constantly 

2127
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:15,080
improve and I've always.
And when you look at human beings,

2128
01:36:15,081 --> 01:36:20,081
like if you looked at us subjectively,
that's one of the main things that we 

2129
01:36:20,081 --> 01:36:20,081
do.

2130
01:36:20,081 --> 01:36:21,890
We,
we produce better technology,

2131
01:36:21,891 --> 01:36:24,320
better objects,
better engineering.

2132
01:36:24,321 --> 01:36:29,321
It's like constantly improving and 
accelerating and then there's this 

2133
01:36:29,321 --> 01:36:33,191
potential artificial intelligence thing.
I've always wondered if that's really 

2134
01:36:33,191 --> 01:36:37,031
what our focus or what our purpose is on
this planet that were like some sort of 

2135
01:36:37,311 --> 01:36:42,311
an electronic caterpillar there going to
become a butterfly that we recognized 

2136
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:47,570
and some sort of a weird way or nature 
recognizes the biological limitations of

2137
01:36:47,571 --> 01:36:52,571
flesh and tissue and that it can advance
far better with something that we create

2138
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:58,390
so that we don't even realize what we're
doing by making this cocoon that we're 

2139
01:36:58,390 --> 01:37:01,781
just building it up,
building enough and we're not even 

2140
01:37:01,781 --> 01:37:01,781
thinking about what we're doing.
We just,

2141
01:37:01,781 --> 01:37:01,820
I want a new laptop,
woo,

2142
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:06,110
and by buying this and buy this 
materialism that we all have,

2143
01:37:06,111 --> 01:37:07,120
right?
We have with this,

2144
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:12,520
people have this innate sort of desire 
for new and shiny objects that that is 

2145
01:37:13,310 --> 01:37:18,310
fueling this innovation and that's 
pushing along this and that one day 

2146
01:37:18,310 --> 01:37:20,720
we're going to give birth to this new 
version of life.

2147
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:24,140
We can call it artificial life,
but it's not artificial.

2148
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:27,710
It's right there.
It's just created by human beings,

2149
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:32,860
which obviously are created by this 
intense and very long evolutionary 

2150
01:37:33,261 --> 01:37:38,261
process,
but this might be a part of that 

2151
01:37:38,261 --> 01:37:38,261
process.

2152
01:37:38,261 --> 01:37:38,261
Yeah,
so I would,

2153
01:37:38,261 --> 01:37:41,940
I would tend to want to remove from that
the sort of anthropomorphic are 

2154
01:37:42,611 --> 01:37:47,611
teleological aspects of the language 
like that it's a purpose or were meant 

2155
01:37:47,611 --> 01:37:51,480
to be here,
but I completely agree with the idea 

2156
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:52,120
that there's a threshold that has been 
crossed,

2157
01:37:52,150 --> 01:37:55,500
whether you want to say it's the last 
500 years or the last 10,000

2158
01:37:55,501 --> 01:37:56,730
years,
uh,

2159
01:37:56,850 --> 01:38:01,850
they're human beings have developed the 
ability to do something that has never 

2160
01:38:01,850 --> 01:38:06,141
been done before and that has this sort 
of recursive self reflective thing that 

2161
01:38:06,871 --> 01:38:11,871
we can build things that can build 
things and we can build things that can 

2162
01:38:11,871 --> 01:38:12,180
learn and we can build things that are 
like living things.

2163
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:17,480
And we are just at the very,
very beginning of exploring the space of

2164
01:38:17,611 --> 01:38:22,611
what's going to happen because of that.
And the idea that we human beings are 

2165
01:38:22,611 --> 01:38:25,890
going to be around 10,000
years to enjoy the fruits of that.

2166
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:28,500
I have no idea whether that's true or 
not.

2167
01:38:28,501 --> 01:38:30,240
I don't even know if that's bad.
I mean,

2168
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:35,420
maybe it'll still be human beings.
Maybe 100 years from now we'll cure 

2169
01:38:35,420 --> 01:38:39,710
death and aging and we'll stop having 
kids and the people who are alive a 

2170
01:38:39,710 --> 01:38:41,370
hundred years from now will different 
other million years.

2171
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:44,970
Maybe human beings will just become more
and more,

2172
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:50,060
uh,
melded with artificial things and 

2173
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:50,820
they'll have artificial bodies and so 
forth.

2174
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:52,320
Or maybe,
you know,

2175
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:55,980
one another under appreciated thing I 
think is that at the very,

2176
01:38:55,981 --> 01:38:59,490
very small scale where we do like 
nanotechnology and so forth,

2177
01:39:00,090 --> 01:39:04,830
there is a whole bunch of problems that 
have already been solved at that scale.

2178
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:07,260
Namely biology cells,
right?

2179
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:10,170
Like cells do many,
many things really,

2180
01:39:10,171 --> 01:39:12,540
really well and they also repair 
themselves.

2181
01:39:12,541 --> 01:39:16,230
They're much less brittle than things 
that we build using metal.

2182
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:18,870
Okay.
So synthetic biology,

2183
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:23,160
just programming existing biological 
organisms or designing new ones,

2184
01:39:23,161 --> 01:39:25,800
but we would still recognize them as 
biological,

2185
01:39:26,130 --> 01:39:31,130
but it might be very,
very different than anything that 

2186
01:39:31,130 --> 01:39:31,740
naturally appeared through the course of
evolution so far.

2187
01:39:32,010 --> 01:39:34,860
That could be the thing that takes off 
and 100 years from now,

2188
01:39:34,861 --> 01:39:39,861
that's all the living beings or all the 
beings with higher intelligence left on 

2189
01:39:39,861 --> 01:39:39,861
earth.
I mean,

2190
01:39:39,861 --> 01:39:42,090
I don't know what the actual thing 
that's going to happen is,

2191
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:46,170
but what I know is that the pace of 
change is just accelerating.

2192
01:39:46,171 --> 01:39:47,660
We're just at the very start.
Yeah,

2193
01:39:47,670 --> 01:39:49,020
we really are.
And it's,

2194
01:39:49,050 --> 01:39:54,050
it's.
So do you ever sit around and try to 

2195
01:39:54,050 --> 01:39:56,691
extrapolate and trying to like look at 
where we are now as opposed to where we 

2196
01:39:56,691 --> 01:40:00,591
were at the turn of the century and a 
20th century and just thinking like 

2197
01:40:01,651 --> 01:40:03,250
where is this going?
I mean this,

2198
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:08,330
it seems like any day now some new 
invention can be put forth that changes 

2199
01:40:09,901 --> 01:40:11,760
the way we interface with reality.
Right.

2200
01:40:11,790 --> 01:40:15,420
And it's subtle because it's not 
uniform,

2201
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:20,480
right?
It's not like it's a weird fact if you 

2202
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:22,080
wanted to make a movie and set it 50 
years ago.

2203
01:40:22,290 --> 01:40:25,110
Right.
So in the 19 sixties it wouldn't be that

2204
01:40:25,111 --> 01:40:28,800
hard to film outside and in certain 
areas,

2205
01:40:28,801 --> 01:40:33,801
certain suburbs,
it kind of looks more or less like look 

2206
01:40:33,801 --> 01:40:33,801
in the 19 fifties.
Whereas it's actually,

2207
01:40:33,801 --> 01:40:38,571
it would be harder to make something 
that was in the 19 sixties look like it 

2208
01:40:38,571 --> 01:40:39,150
did the 1910.
It's right.

2209
01:40:39,151 --> 01:40:44,151
There's sort of more obvious visible 
change just because cars were different 

2210
01:40:44,151 --> 01:40:48,501
and so forth,
but you don't see the sort of 

2211
01:40:48,501 --> 01:40:50,430
technological change that might be have 
a far bigger impact,

2212
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:55,460
uh,
in electronics and artificial 

2213
01:40:55,460 --> 01:40:55,460
intelligence and so forth had happened 
in the

2214
01:40:55,460 --> 01:40:56,040
last 50 years.
So jessica,

2215
01:40:56,060 --> 01:41:01,060
there's no visible sign of the change.
Doesn't mean that the changes cannot be 

2216
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:04,681
eventually a very profound.
It's always amazing to when you look 

2217
01:41:04,681 --> 01:41:07,951
back and like science fiction movies 
from the eighties where they were 

2218
01:41:07,951 --> 01:41:08,180
predicting 2017,
you know,

2219
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:13,360
they,
they thought we were going to be flying 

2220
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:13,360
around in space constantly.
Yeah,

2221
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:15,850
like the movie alien.
What year was that supposed to be?

2222
01:41:15,851 --> 01:41:19,320
I think that's like the year $2,100
or something like that.

2223
01:41:19,321 --> 01:41:20,530
Right?
It's not that far,

2224
01:41:20,790 --> 01:41:25,790
but what we're really good at is taking 
things that already exist and 

2225
01:41:25,790 --> 01:41:25,790
extrapolating it to be faster and 
bigger.

2226
01:41:25,790 --> 01:41:28,360
Right.
So if you can build an airplane,

2227
01:41:28,361 --> 01:41:30,220
then you can build a rocket ship and 
arbitrarily fast.

2228
01:41:30,221 --> 01:41:33,850
That's easy to imagine.
But things that change culture,

2229
01:41:33,851 --> 01:41:38,851
like really curing aging,
that's hard to imagine what that would 

2230
01:41:38,851 --> 01:41:43,261
be like.
It's also greedy because like where are 

2231
01:41:43,261 --> 01:41:43,261
we going to put all these goddamn 
people?

2232
01:41:43,261 --> 01:41:47,490
If they live forever,
you live forever and everybody has four 

2233
01:41:47,490 --> 01:41:47,490
kids.
We've got a real problem on our hands.

2234
01:41:47,950 --> 01:41:49,000
No more.
No more kids.

2235
01:41:49,001 --> 01:41:50,590
No ham clearly.
Do you have kids?

2236
01:41:50,790 --> 01:41:52,210
No.
Well that's why you say that,

2237
01:41:53,230 --> 01:41:54,730
but I'm not gonna live forever either.
You know,

2238
01:41:54,970 --> 01:41:57,310
if I did have kids and maybe their kids 
would live forever,

2239
01:41:57,311 --> 01:41:58,140
but you know,
that's,

2240
01:41:58,170 --> 01:42:01,600
that's the thing.
That's the size of the change in society

2241
01:42:01,601 --> 01:42:03,160
that will be required by something like 
that.

2242
01:42:03,190 --> 01:42:04,450
Twenty one,
22.

2243
01:42:04,890 --> 01:42:08,170
That's When alien takes place.
That's 100 years from now.

2244
01:42:08,530 --> 01:42:10,900
Get out of here.
There's no way it could be.

2245
01:42:10,990 --> 01:42:14,320
Maybe a model.
They had some shitty monitors for 21,

2246
01:42:14,321 --> 01:42:15,090
22.
I mean,

2247
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:16,250
god,
they were terrible.

2248
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:17,350
Terribly one know.
Yeah.

2249
01:42:17,351 --> 01:42:22,351
But the inside of the cockpit for mother
when that dude gets in there and finds 

2250
01:42:22,351 --> 01:42:26,500
out that there's some giant plate far 
into the future.

2251
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:27,220
Right?
oh yeah.

2252
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:28,780
It's really,
really hard.

2253
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:33,840
Yeah.
I think we're more likely looking at 

2254
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:35,710
some sort of a augmented a desktop sort 
of scenario.

2255
01:42:35,711 --> 01:42:36,280
Like,
um,

2256
01:42:36,340 --> 01:42:38,560
have you seen these new products like,
uh,

2257
01:42:38,630 --> 01:42:41,350
that microsoft is working on and some of
these other companies,

2258
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:44,080
but I think before very long,
it won't be a desktop,

2259
01:42:44,081 --> 01:42:46,630
it'll just be our thoughts really.
We'll just,

2260
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:48,640
you know,
like I remember what I had for lunch.

2261
01:42:48,641 --> 01:42:51,190
I'll remember what the population of 
Malta was in the year.

2262
01:42:51,191 --> 01:42:52,510
1,500.
What am I looking at here?

2263
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:55,970
Jamie?
Shitty movies.

2264
01:42:55,980 --> 01:42:56,780
This.
Yeah,

2265
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:58,670
this is the first one said.
I mean,

2266
01:42:58,680 --> 01:42:59,410
that's.
So I was googling,

2267
01:42:59,610 --> 01:43:02,170
it could of got tagged with something 
else and I didn't recognize it,

2268
01:43:02,171 --> 01:43:05,050
but that's pretty,
that's pretty good.

2269
01:43:05,051 --> 01:43:06,540
looking pretty good.
No,

2270
01:43:06,700 --> 01:43:11,530
that can't be the original alien is it?
I Think that's like alien two or three.

2271
01:43:14,330 --> 01:43:15,320
No dramas.
Yeah,

2272
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:17,960
this is bill.
Is that the first one?

2273
01:43:18,020 --> 01:43:19,130
The second one you clicked on?
Yeah,

2274
01:43:19,131 --> 01:43:20,740
that's,
yeah,

2275
01:43:20,750 --> 01:43:23,660
they look pretty bad ass.
So that's trauma.

2276
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:26,750
What I meant was there's a white room 
that,

2277
01:43:26,751 --> 01:43:31,751
uh,
I forget the actor's name in the 

2278
01:43:31,751 --> 01:43:31,751
original alien,
the original alien.

2279
01:43:31,751 --> 01:43:32,660
People don't even realize it was in the 
seventies.

2280
01:43:33,050 --> 01:43:34,450
It seemed crazy.
Yeah,

2281
01:43:34,451 --> 01:43:36,560
it's corny weaver ages very well,
by the way.

2282
01:43:37,370 --> 01:43:37,820
Just,
sorry,

2283
01:43:37,821 --> 01:43:38,190
what was the.
Oh,

2284
01:43:38,191 --> 01:43:40,540
the defenders here's done yet.
Um,

2285
01:43:40,970 --> 01:43:45,970
because she was in that movie up.
she's probably in her twenties back 

2286
01:43:45,970 --> 01:43:47,690
then,
but that movie in 1979,

2287
01:43:48,050 --> 01:43:50,090
like their idea of what?
Twenty one,

2288
01:43:50,091 --> 01:43:51,890
22 is going be like they had

2289
01:43:52,230 --> 01:43:55,890
like weird lights flashing and the cabin
that didn't really seem to make a lot of

2290
01:43:55,910 --> 01:43:57,860
sense,
but they looked electronics.

2291
01:43:58,370 --> 01:44:00,530
These might've been pictures from the 
new alien.

2292
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:01,280
Yeah,
that's what it looks like.

2293
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:07,680
Yeah.
Because they could do to kind of look 

2294
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:07,680
like a tesla is yours.
Yeah,

2295
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:10,780
it was weird because they're kind of 
saying this is like from actual 

2296
01:44:10,780 --> 01:44:10,970
production set.
Oh yeah,

2297
01:44:10,971 --> 01:44:12,160
that's the new one.
See?

2298
01:44:12,170 --> 01:44:17,170
Because they're kind of saddled down by 
the problem that they're replicating a 

2299
01:44:17,170 --> 01:44:18,570
film,
you know,

2300
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:23,740
that was from the 19 seventies and there
might be settled down by the deavers 

2301
01:44:23,991 --> 01:44:25,770
that look like you're in an airplane.
Yeah.

2302
01:44:25,810 --> 01:44:27,800
Would not be like that.
You don't think so?

2303
01:44:28,130 --> 01:44:29,600
No.
It could still be here in your head.

2304
01:44:29,630 --> 01:44:31,460
He thinks I need buttons.
Yeah.

2305
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:34,290
So even navigation while being here.
Well,

2306
01:44:34,350 --> 01:44:39,350
I think we live in the only generation 
that's going to get repetitive stress 

2307
01:44:39,350 --> 01:44:39,500
injury from poking it or devices all the
time.

2308
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:40,370
Really?
Yeah.

2309
01:44:40,390 --> 01:44:42,010
That's what,
that's the most useless thing that.

2310
01:44:42,011 --> 01:44:42,980
well,
it's a very slow,

2311
01:44:42,981 --> 01:44:44,990
inefficient interface type.
Being on your cell phone.

2312
01:44:44,991 --> 01:44:46,700
It takes best.
I hardly do it anymore.

2313
01:44:46,701 --> 01:44:48,440
A lot of times I'm talking to my phone 
now.

2314
01:44:49,110 --> 01:44:51,110
That's very old fashioned wri.
Very retro.

2315
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:51,920
No,
no.

2316
01:44:51,921 --> 01:44:53,600
Using voice recognition software.
Yeah.

2317
01:44:53,601 --> 01:44:54,080
Okay.
Right.

2318
01:44:54,380 --> 01:44:59,380
That's retro mean when to make phone 
calls.

2319
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:00,860
oh,
I do that too.

2320
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:02,990
I'm a crazy phone call person.
Um,

2321
01:45:02,991 --> 01:45:07,991
but the uh,
text function ready for his recognition 

2322
01:45:07,991 --> 01:45:08,930
function,
that's really amazing.

2323
01:45:09,700 --> 01:45:12,500
I don't use it as much,
but yeah,

2324
01:45:12,590 --> 01:45:14,150
look how good it works.
I'll show you right now.

2325
01:45:14,151 --> 01:45:16,940
It's really pretty interesting.
We can click on this,

2326
01:45:16,941 --> 01:45:18,530
right?
There's like the notes thing.

2327
01:45:18,531 --> 01:45:23,531
This is how I do a lot of this stuff.
Like if in my car and I have an idea 

2328
01:45:23,531 --> 01:45:26,891
that comes to me,
I'll either record it like with the 

2329
01:45:26,891 --> 01:45:29,381
voice recording function or sometimes 
it's better to do this and when you're 

2330
01:45:29,381 --> 01:45:34,241
doing this it essentially can pick up 
everything you're saying in real time 

2331
01:45:34,241 --> 01:45:34,910
and print it out.

2332
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:37,670
Yep.
They cut it right.

2333
01:45:37,790 --> 01:45:38,690
That's amazing.
Right?

2334
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:42,920
Bad is.
I mean everything perfectly spelled.

2335
01:45:42,921 --> 01:45:45,830
What I Just said folks is now on my 
phone.

2336
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:48,500
Amazing.
What does this scene,

2337
01:45:48,570 --> 01:45:51,170
these are the new.
I don't know how well they work.

2338
01:45:51,230 --> 01:45:53,210
I've only seen him out and commercially 
whatnot,

2339
01:45:53,260 --> 01:45:55,880
but real time in ir translations and 
french spanish,

2340
01:45:55,910 --> 01:45:57,080
english.
I've seen chinese,

2341
01:45:57,081 --> 01:45:58,220
japanese.
oh,

2342
01:45:58,221 --> 01:45:59,960
I've seen that.
Size of an ear bud.

2343
01:46:00,230 --> 01:46:01,210
Yeah,
I've seen that.

2344
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:06,400
So again,
once you have the link inside and he 

2345
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:09,131
just interface with your brain,
then essentially you will speak every 

2346
01:46:09,131 --> 01:46:09,131
language.
One hundred 29 bucks.

2347
01:46:09,131 --> 01:46:10,250
That's amazing.
So you can go.

2348
01:46:10,251 --> 01:46:11,990
Is it called babel fish?
That's what it's called.

2349
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:13,900
Like it like it.
Like oh,

2350
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:15,200
that's not the name,
but I know,

2351
01:46:15,201 --> 01:46:16,300
but that's not the name of it.
What is it?

2352
01:46:16,410 --> 01:46:20,000
What's the name of it?
This one I have now from waverly labs,

2353
01:46:20,001 --> 01:46:20,840
it's called the pilot.

2354
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:23,230
I think the pilot.
This is pretty awesome though.

2355
01:46:23,710 --> 01:46:25,790
You just go this way.
He's japanese.

2356
01:46:25,791 --> 01:46:28,850
One of them.
On this particular one?

2357
01:46:28,940 --> 01:46:31,040
I don't believe so,
but I'm 90 percent sure.

2358
01:46:31,041 --> 01:46:33,500
I've seen videos like on facebook 
showing a japanese one.

2359
01:46:33,501 --> 01:46:35,940
I'm finding my first trip to Japan and 
that'd be very bad.

2360
01:46:35,950 --> 01:46:36,910
Just has amazing.
Yeah,

2361
01:46:36,930 --> 01:46:38,510
I've never been there.
What you going to go to tokyo?

2362
01:46:38,511 --> 01:46:40,250
Where are you going to go?
We were flying.

2363
01:46:40,251 --> 01:46:45,251
There's a conference in food cola and 
then we'll visit a hiroshima and osaka 

2364
01:46:45,251 --> 01:46:46,160
after that.
Oh wow.

2365
01:46:46,310 --> 01:46:47,090
Kyoto.
Hopefully.

2366
01:46:47,180 --> 01:46:49,980
I went to Japan a few years back and it 
feels

2367
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:53,310
like you're in a super polite alien 
world.

2368
01:46:53,780 --> 01:46:55,110
Happy.
That sounds good to me.

2369
01:46:56,070 --> 01:47:01,070
It's beautiful.
They're very polite and the food's 

2370
01:47:01,070 --> 01:47:01,070
amazing.
Even more one to one.

2371
01:47:01,070 --> 01:47:05,961
And then using watson.
Watson to do more languages and I just 

2372
01:47:05,961 --> 01:47:07,110
said before portuguese scroll up so I 
can see what it looks.

2373
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:12,120
So watson is an example of one of these 
programs which learns things that we 

2374
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:12,120
don't know how.
Right.

2375
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:12,900
Okay.
That's a problem.

2376
01:47:14,730 --> 01:47:16,690
And that speaks japanese and french.
So yeah.

2377
01:47:16,710 --> 01:47:18,510
So this one is,
um,

2378
01:47:18,540 --> 01:47:19,740
how does it,
where jamie,

2379
01:47:19,770 --> 01:47:24,770
what do you see the bluetooth and wifi 
out of the range of bluetooth and wifi 

2380
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:30,200
translate one to one can still work just
as well as the first device on the 

2381
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:34,581
market for language translation using ai
that does not rely on connectivity to 

2382
01:47:34,951 --> 01:47:39,951
operate.
It offers significant potential for its 

2383
01:47:39,951 --> 01:47:42,351
unique application across airlines,
foreign government relations and even 

2384
01:47:42,351 --> 01:47:43,110
not for profits working in remote areas.

2385
01:47:43,110 --> 01:47:44,880
Whoa,
that's crazy.

2386
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:46,230
So,
uh,

2387
01:47:46,950 --> 01:47:49,460
so it's different than the pilot 
earpiece.

2388
01:47:49,470 --> 01:47:50,670
How's it,
how do you wear that?

2389
01:47:50,671 --> 01:47:55,671
Soccer was like get over your head.
It sounds just like a hearing aid would 

2390
01:47:55,671 --> 01:48:00,031
probably just look like that.
And I'll probably be big now just like 

2391
01:48:00,031 --> 01:48:00,031
they use probably big gets smaller and 
smaller.

2392
01:48:00,590 --> 01:48:02,160
This would not be sexy while you were 
wearing it,

2393
01:48:02,161 --> 01:48:04,320
but yeah,
unless you're into that stuff.

2394
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:07,350
Um,
it was saying that you download language

2395
01:48:07,351 --> 01:48:10,260
packs so it'll be off the internet.
Yeah.

2396
01:48:10,261 --> 01:48:11,970
So essentially it'd be like,
um,

2397
01:48:12,630 --> 01:48:17,460
there's these map applications like onyx
maps and stuff like that.

2398
01:48:17,461 --> 01:48:22,461
you can download like a,
like sort of a google earth type to 

2399
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:25,740
topographical map of areas and you could
look at it,

2400
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:28,500
say if you're hiking,
you could look at these on your phone.

2401
01:48:28,530 --> 01:48:33,530
Even if you don't have cell service,
you can just pull them up and get a 

2402
01:48:33,530 --> 01:48:33,530
google image of like,
oh,

2403
01:48:33,530 --> 01:48:34,650
hey,
here's the creek that we have to go down

2404
01:48:34,651 --> 01:48:35,490
to get water.

2405
01:48:36,690 --> 01:48:38,190
yeah.
Yeah.

2406
01:48:38,460 --> 01:48:40,590
We're getting.
It's getting super slippery.

2407
01:48:40,620 --> 01:48:42,690
Two hundred 79 bucks and you can use 
that sucker.

2408
01:48:42,810 --> 01:48:45,660
That's right.
Now that's amazing part.

2409
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:49,110
Don't do it.
Take three to five seconds to translate.

2410
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:54,300
Woo.
Most languages there's a thing called 

2411
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:54,300
google lens,
which is pretty amazing too.

2412
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:59,181
I use this when I was in Italy and you 
take your phone and you look at 

2413
01:48:59,181 --> 01:49:02,070
something through your phone and it 
translates it on the screen,

2414
01:49:02,310 --> 01:49:07,310
which is amazing.
Like you're looking at a sign and you 

2415
01:49:07,310 --> 01:49:07,310
hold it up and it'll tell you what the 
site like.

2416
01:49:07,310 --> 01:49:07,620
We were at a train station.
I was like,

2417
01:49:07,621 --> 01:49:10,500
what the fuck does that sign?
Say you put your phone up there with the

2418
01:49:10,501 --> 01:49:12,770
google lens and it'll translate it.
I know I use that.

2419
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:14,730
The only problem was like for menus,
it's like,

2420
01:49:14,731 --> 01:49:17,160
what is this out with roses chicken.
I have no idea what that is.

2421
01:49:17,700 --> 01:49:18,600
But yes,
right.

2422
01:49:18,940 --> 01:49:21,540
Yeah.
Well fortunately,

2423
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:24,470
or unfortunately when you go abroad,
uh,

2424
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:29,500
americans travel so much and so to a 
english people from england shore.

2425
01:49:30,620 --> 01:49:33,300
Yeah.
But it's such a common language.

2426
01:49:33,330 --> 01:49:35,820
Most of the world can speak english.
That's right.

2427
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:37,290
Yeah.
We would definitely have an advantage.

2428
01:49:37,291 --> 01:49:42,291
That was huge in Italy.
I mean it's like you barely need to 

2429
01:49:42,291 --> 01:49:43,890
understand anything other than saying 
thank you and saying,

2430
01:49:43,891 --> 01:49:45,540
you know,
hello and good evening.

2431
01:49:45,570 --> 01:49:47,010
Things along those lines.
One to sarah,

2432
01:49:47,530 --> 01:49:48,070
you,
um,

2433
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:49,480
you can get by.
But yeah,

2434
01:49:49,481 --> 01:49:54,481
the first time I went abroad to farm 
speaking country was France and I was 

2435
01:49:54,481 --> 01:49:55,780
just too shy to talk to anybody because 
I was not in paris.

2436
01:49:55,781 --> 01:50:00,781
I was like out in the middle of nowhere 
where people did not speak english and 

2437
01:50:00,781 --> 01:50:01,150
you know,
by now I'm an I.

2438
01:50:01,180 --> 01:50:03,790
And I even had like read the phrase 
books and things like that.

2439
01:50:03,791 --> 01:50:05,350
But by now I've just done it so many 
times.

2440
01:50:05,351 --> 01:50:10,351
I don't really care.
I'll try to speak my two words of the 

2441
01:50:10,351 --> 01:50:11,050
local language and then try to switch to
english and if it doesn't work,

2442
01:50:11,051 --> 01:50:12,610
it doesn't work.
CAn we just do hand gestures?

2443
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:15,850
When you traveled a place like France,
France,

2444
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:20,880
excuse me,
people have this french people in 

2445
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:24,391
particular.
There's always the stereotype that you 

2446
01:50:24,391 --> 01:50:24,391
hear that french people think that 
americans are rude.

2447
01:50:24,391 --> 01:50:28,860
Like I would like try to go like way out
of my way to make sure that no one 

2448
01:50:28,860 --> 01:50:28,860
thought I was like a rude american.

2449
01:50:28,870 --> 01:50:33,870
Yeah.
Because there's always this reaction 

2450
01:50:33,870 --> 01:50:36,331
that they have.
Like the worst case scenario is the 

2451
01:50:36,331 --> 01:50:39,481
american goes over there and it's pissed
off that they don't speak english and 

2452
01:50:39,481 --> 01:50:42,550
they started don't know.
My first trip I was treated very,

2453
01:50:42,551 --> 01:50:44,260
very well in France.
Very,

2454
01:50:44,261 --> 01:50:49,261
very politely.
I even like I bought something in a 

2455
01:50:49,261 --> 01:50:49,480
store and I didn't understand what the 
price was,

2456
01:50:49,510 --> 01:50:54,510
so I just sort of kept gIving money 
until they nodded and by mistake I had 

2457
01:50:54,510 --> 01:50:58,231
given too much and the guy like ran out 
after me to catch me leaving to give me 

2458
01:50:58,751 --> 01:51:01,480
my money back.
That was uniform.

2459
01:51:01,481 --> 01:51:06,481
except in transportation industry.
It's like whenever I wanted to buy a 

2460
01:51:06,481 --> 01:51:06,760
plane ticket or whatever,
that was very,

2461
01:51:06,761 --> 01:51:11,761
very hard.
The ironic enough with a rude or were 

2462
01:51:11,761 --> 01:51:13,750
they just definitely tired of dealing 
with tourists,

2463
01:51:14,550 --> 01:51:15,120
you know,
I would,

2464
01:51:15,230 --> 01:51:17,160
I would say in french I would say,
you know,

2465
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:18,220
do you speak english?

2466
01:51:18,220 --> 01:51:20,140
And they would say,
of course I do in french.

2467
01:51:21,160 --> 01:51:21,760
I'm like,
okay,

2468
01:51:21,761 --> 01:51:24,860
well then can we do that?
Yeah,

2469
01:51:24,910 --> 01:51:26,800
they're probably just exhausted.
That just exists.

2470
01:51:26,830 --> 01:51:28,210
But that's how it is in America.
I mean,

2471
01:51:28,211 --> 01:51:29,770
you deal with people at the airline 
counter.

2472
01:51:29,771 --> 01:51:31,060
They always had this look in their face.
Like,

2473
01:51:31,061 --> 01:51:32,340
what time is it?
When do I don't,

2474
01:51:32,341 --> 01:51:37,341
I don't have to doing something you're 
not passionate about unlike you with 

2475
01:51:37,961 --> 01:51:39,550
your legal notepad,
right.

2476
01:51:39,580 --> 01:51:41,310
In the alien languages and uh,
you know,

2477
01:51:41,311 --> 01:51:46,311
I can find somewhere it's a,
it's a great privilege what I do for 

2478
01:51:46,311 --> 01:51:46,311
living,
right?

2479
01:51:46,311 --> 01:51:50,221
Like,
I can't believe that I get paid to do 

2480
01:51:50,221 --> 01:51:51,691
this and it's hard.
I have to tell my incoming graduate 

2481
01:51:51,691 --> 01:51:55,111
students,
if you get a phd in theoretical physics 

2482
01:51:55,111 --> 01:51:57,571
from caltech and you probably want to be
a physics professor because that's the 

2483
01:51:57,571 --> 01:51:59,920
only thing you can do with that degree 
and your chances are maybe 25 percent of

2484
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:01,270
that's pretty damn good.

2485
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:03,850
It's good.
But after You,

2486
01:52:04,420 --> 01:52:09,420
you're like 26 years old and putting a 
lot of work to still only knows the 25 

2487
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:11,140
percent chance of succeeding,
if that's still pretty amazing.

2488
01:52:11,141 --> 01:52:16,141
I mean,
if you're trying to be a standup 

2489
01:52:16,141 --> 01:52:16,141
comedian,
your odds are like one percent if you're

2490
01:52:16,141 --> 01:52:16,510
lucky.
No,

2491
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:21,540
the very,
very good thing about academia is it's 

2492
01:52:21,540 --> 01:52:21,540
very clearly upper out and you know,
you,

2493
01:52:21,540 --> 01:52:23,740
there's time limits.
Like if you haven't succeeded by now,

2494
01:52:24,070 --> 01:52:26,740
you're gone.
You can to be discovered tomorrow.

2495
01:52:27,010 --> 01:52:28,720
Uh,
you usually go to wall street and make a

2496
01:52:28,721 --> 01:52:30,190
lot more money.
Oh,

2497
01:52:30,340 --> 01:52:33,910
so hE's to be in physics from caltech.
You're not going to start praying.

2498
01:52:34,060 --> 01:52:36,670
People will hire you to do something 
interesting.

2499
01:52:36,730 --> 01:52:41,730
So what would you do on wall to wall 
street with a phd from caltech these 

2500
01:52:41,730 --> 01:52:44,340
days?
All the money's being made by algorithms

2501
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:46,220
that study of the stock market

2502
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:48,950
and destroy human beings picking stocks,
right?

2503
01:52:48,951 --> 01:52:51,200
Renaissance technologies and places like
that.

2504
01:52:51,290 --> 01:52:52,180
Um,
I mean,

2505
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:57,310
like we were just talking about,
but soon the entire stock market will 

2506
01:52:57,310 --> 01:53:00,701
just be dueling algorithms trying to 
sell something a microsecond before 

2507
01:53:00,701 --> 01:53:00,701
something else does.

2508
01:53:00,701 --> 01:53:04,350
Now you are involved in a hard science,
right?

2509
01:53:04,351 --> 01:53:04,860
I mean,
you're,

2510
01:53:04,861 --> 01:53:09,861
you're,
you're involved in this trying to 

2511
01:53:09,861 --> 01:53:11,310
understand the world and the universe 
itself.

2512
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:16,760
Do you get,
do you see any of the identity politics 

2513
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:17,220
issues that are going on on campuses 
today?

2514
01:53:17,221 --> 01:53:18,930
I mean,
it's such a hot subject,

2515
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:19,770
whereas

2516
01:53:20,510 --> 01:53:21,260
a little bit,
you know,

2517
01:53:21,261 --> 01:53:24,740
I don't,
my job at caltech is research professor,

2518
01:53:25,120 --> 01:53:27,560
so I don't even teach a lot of courses 
to be honest.

2519
01:53:27,561 --> 01:53:30,110
And caltech is not the typical campus in
many,

2520
01:53:30,111 --> 01:53:31,550
many ways.
Uh,

2521
01:53:31,580 --> 01:53:36,580
but you know,
we just had a professor who was 

2522
01:53:36,580 --> 01:53:36,580
basically fired,
uh,

2523
01:53:36,580 --> 01:53:37,250
for harassing students.
It,

2524
01:53:37,300 --> 01:53:39,140
it does happen.
Sexual harassment.

2525
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:40,630
Yeah.
That's trying to get laid.

2526
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,010
It wasn't quite,
it was more complicated than that.

2527
01:53:43,070 --> 01:53:46,130
He fell in love with a student and fired
her.

2528
01:53:46,140 --> 01:53:49,810
And um,
and yeah,

2529
01:53:49,870 --> 01:53:51,650
there's just no question that,
you know,

2530
01:53:51,651 --> 01:53:56,651
I'm in an area of theoretical physics 
where there's a very tiny fraction of 

2531
01:53:56,651 --> 01:53:56,651
women,
um,

2532
01:53:56,651 --> 01:53:59,750
and even tinier fraction of african 
americans and so forth,

2533
01:53:59,751 --> 01:54:04,751
but that's kind of less surprising 
because they just don't come up usually 

2534
01:54:04,751 --> 01:54:09,191
in economic circumstances that put 
theoretical physics is one of the 

2535
01:54:09,191 --> 01:54:09,290
plausible future research careers.

2536
01:54:09,650 --> 01:54:11,710
Uh,
But you know,

2537
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:14,930
I see an enormous amount of 
discrimination against women in my field

2538
01:54:14,990 --> 01:54:19,990
and it's there and women leave and some 
of the complaints against it or are 

2539
01:54:20,690 --> 01:54:22,280
overblown,
but many of them are very,

2540
01:54:22,281 --> 01:54:24,500
very real.
so that's a real problem for us.

2541
01:54:24,501 --> 01:54:25,910
I think it's changing.
I think it's fixing,

2542
01:54:25,911 --> 01:54:27,940
but it's slow.
What kind of discrimination do you see?

2543
01:54:29,060 --> 01:54:32,780
It's these days it's usually very 
subtle.

2544
01:54:32,870 --> 01:54:37,870
It's usually a,
you're taking a little bit less 

2545
01:54:37,870 --> 01:54:40,451
seriously if you're a woman.
I mean there's all sorts of tests that 

2546
01:54:40,451 --> 01:54:40,451
have been done,
right?

2547
01:54:40,451 --> 01:54:43,850
Like people handed out a mathematics 
papers and with,

2548
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:48,920
and then all they did was change the 
name of the author James Smith versus 

2549
01:54:48,920 --> 01:54:53,441
Jennifer Smith.
And they were always ranked much worse 

2550
01:54:53,441 --> 01:54:53,441
when it was Jennifer Smith who was the 
author even.

2551
01:54:53,441 --> 01:54:55,540
It's exactly the same paper grilling 
and,

2552
01:54:55,680 --> 01:55:00,680
uh,
and know there's a certain style of 

2553
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:04,010
aggressive in your face,
egotism that serves you well in academia

2554
01:55:04,011 --> 01:55:04,520
generally.

2555
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:06,330
And in physics in particular,
uh,

2556
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:08,570
putting yourself forward,
asking questions,

2557
01:55:08,571 --> 01:55:13,250
being loud and noisy and a women are 
less good at that for whatever reason.

2558
01:55:13,251 --> 01:55:14,750
They're not trained to do that or it's 
an eight.

2559
01:55:14,751 --> 01:55:15,860
I have no idea.
But,

2560
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:21,520
uh,
they can sort of get bullied into 

2561
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:21,520
silence or just say like,
this is not worth it.

2562
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:23,390
I'm going to go do something.
We go to wall street to make money.

2563
01:55:23,540 --> 01:55:28,100
Also a woman who does that is not likely
to be received as well as a man who does

2564
01:55:28,101 --> 01:55:29,900
that,
held against them.

2565
01:55:29,930 --> 01:55:31,970
Yeah.
They're deemed to be like a bitch.

2566
01:55:32,090 --> 01:55:34,820
Yeah.
So my guy was aggressive at caltech.

2567
01:55:34,821 --> 01:55:37,610
I'm on the fourth floor of a building,
which is the theoretical physics,

2568
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:40,100
theoretical high energy physics group.
Uh,

2569
01:55:40,190 --> 01:55:43,470
so there's maybe 30 people,
total professors,

2570
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:44,340
post docs,

2571
01:55:44,370 --> 01:55:46,090
graduate students.
Uh,

2572
01:55:46,091 --> 01:55:49,500
and until this year,
there were zero women out of 30,

2573
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:51,960
which is just embarrassing.
It's just bad.

2574
01:55:51,990 --> 01:55:54,740
Right.
And who would want to be the one woman?

2575
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:56,100
Right,
right.

2576
01:55:57,030 --> 01:55:58,490
Yeah.
Yeah.

2577
01:55:59,020 --> 01:56:04,020
But you know,
especially there's two like men either 

2578
01:56:04,020 --> 01:56:05,400
who thinks they can have sex with you or
amanda can never have sex with you.

2579
01:56:05,570 --> 01:56:06,130
Right.
That was,

2580
01:56:06,170 --> 01:56:11,170
we both annoying and like,
if you're lucky you get a guy who 

2581
01:56:11,170 --> 01:56:14,120
doesn't want to have sex with you,
he just wants to be your friend and 

2582
01:56:14,120 --> 01:56:14,120
that,
that's all right.

2583
01:56:14,120 --> 01:56:14,120
Yeah.
But I think that,

2584
01:56:14,120 --> 01:56:16,110
you know,
honestly,

2585
01:56:16,111 --> 01:56:21,111
if I were giving advice to young women 
whose primary goal was to become a 

2586
01:56:21,111 --> 01:56:23,300
successful theoretical physicist,
you know,

2587
01:56:23,310 --> 01:56:28,310
if that was your only goal,
then don't raise a fuss about sexism or 

2588
01:56:28,310 --> 01:56:33,201
discrimination because just like 
worrying about the interpretation of 

2589
01:56:33,201 --> 01:56:37,911
quantum mechanics counts,
it's points against you when you're 

2590
01:56:37,911 --> 01:56:41,120
being judged as a theoretical physicist 
worrying about discrimination against 

2591
01:56:41,120 --> 01:56:41,120
you.

2592
01:56:41,120 --> 01:56:43,050
Key accounTs as points against you.
People think like,

2593
01:56:43,051 --> 01:56:43,560
oh,
you're,

2594
01:56:44,120 --> 01:56:47,300
you're not really interested in physics.
You just want to make a political fuss.

2595
01:56:47,390 --> 01:56:49,620
Wow,
that's unfortunate.

2596
01:56:49,621 --> 01:56:50,350
Keep quiet.
Yeah.

2597
01:56:50,670 --> 01:56:55,670
I mean,
I know that what you're saying is 

2598
01:56:55,670 --> 01:56:57,261
pragmatic,
but a lot of people don't want to hear 

2599
01:56:57,261 --> 01:56:57,261
that,
like keep quiet.

2600
01:56:57,261 --> 01:56:57,261
They don't want to hear,
keep quiet.

2601
01:56:57,261 --> 01:57:01,581
When you tell women too,
when you're talking about 

2602
01:57:01,581 --> 01:57:03,770
discrimination,
so maybe your only goal in life is not 

2603
01:57:03,770 --> 01:57:04,440
to personally become a successful 
theoretical physicists.

2604
01:57:04,441 --> 01:57:05,250
I mean,
just as a.

2605
01:57:05,460 --> 01:57:07,920
I don't,
my advice is not keep quiet.

2606
01:57:08,010 --> 01:57:13,010
My advice is if that's your goal,
the way to achieve that goal is to keep 

2607
01:57:13,010 --> 01:57:13,110
quiet.
That's gross though,

2608
01:57:13,140 --> 01:57:13,680
right?
It is.

2609
01:57:13,681 --> 01:57:18,681
and so I think that it's the job of the 
guys to raise a little bit of a fuss 

2610
01:57:18,841 --> 01:57:23,841
about this and you know,
I saw that at caltech where this guy 

2611
01:57:23,841 --> 01:57:23,841
recently got fired.

2612
01:57:23,841 --> 01:57:26,670
How many people were willing to make 
excuses for his really,

2613
01:57:26,671 --> 01:57:28,200
really,
really bad behavior.

2614
01:57:28,730 --> 01:57:29,910
Uh,
you know,

2615
01:57:29,911 --> 01:57:34,911
it's,
it's unseemly to talk about these 

2616
01:57:34,911 --> 01:57:34,911
things.
We hope it's not true like these,

2617
01:57:34,911 --> 01:57:36,600
this is our friend.
This is someone we worked with.

2618
01:57:36,601 --> 01:57:37,940
We don't want to believe this about 
them.

2619
01:57:37,941 --> 01:57:40,410
We want to protect him.
So physics,

2620
01:57:40,411 --> 01:57:41,640
philosophy,
astronomy,

2621
01:57:41,641 --> 01:57:46,641
all these areas are now having these 
examples of famous big name professors 

2622
01:57:48,421 --> 01:57:53,421
that it's finally being revealed for 
last 20 years had been regularly 

2623
01:57:53,421 --> 01:57:54,570
harassing graduate students and pushing 
them out of the field.

2624
01:57:55,530 --> 01:57:59,940
I think maybe finally that's coming to 
light enough that it's hopefully will go

2625
01:57:59,941 --> 01:58:01,980
away a little bit.
Human folly,

2626
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:02,790
you know,
it's interesting.

2627
01:58:02,791 --> 01:58:07,791
It's a lot of what we were talking about
earlier with the people that don't 

2628
01:58:07,791 --> 01:58:11,361
necessarily understand quantum physics.
And so they sort of dismiss what's 

2629
01:58:11,361 --> 01:58:13,790
important about it or people that,
you know,

2630
01:58:13,870 --> 01:58:16,340
just use their,
they,

2631
01:58:16,341 --> 01:58:19,100
they,
they rely too much on ego or they,

2632
01:58:19,130 --> 01:58:20,670
it's too much of a part of their life.
I mean,

2633
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:25,680
they human folly,
that sort of make excuses and gets 

2634
01:58:25,680 --> 01:58:26,010
involved in everything.
And you know,

2635
01:58:26,011 --> 01:58:27,390
I'm uh,
I'm not,

2636
01:58:27,830 --> 01:58:32,830
uh,
the broader question of identity 

2637
01:58:32,830 --> 01:58:32,830
politics,
etc.

2638
01:58:32,830 --> 01:58:32,830
I mean,
I'm,

2639
01:58:32,830 --> 01:58:34,800
I'm pretty lefty justice warrior about 
this stuff.

2640
01:58:34,801 --> 01:58:35,970
To be honest,
I think that,

2641
01:58:36,420 --> 01:58:38,760
uh,
the number of women,

2642
01:58:38,761 --> 01:58:43,761
for example,
women are just the most obvious example 

2643
01:58:43,761 --> 01:58:43,761
in my field who have been

2644
01:58:43,761 --> 01:58:46,510
pushed out of my field because of bias 
and discrimination in very,

2645
01:58:46,511 --> 01:58:48,950
very obviously,
you know,

2646
01:58:48,990 --> 01:58:51,610
um,
verifiable ways is just,

2647
01:58:51,640 --> 01:58:53,630
that's the big embarrassment,
you know,

2648
01:58:53,950 --> 01:58:58,950
but at the same time I'm kind of a free 
speech absolutist if some crazy person 

2649
01:58:58,950 --> 01:59:01,200
who has very retro grade views wants to 
say those retrograde views.

2650
01:59:01,201 --> 01:59:04,210
And I think that if someone else wants 
to invite them on campus to do it,

2651
01:59:04,211 --> 01:59:07,960
I think they should be allowed to say 
all the craziness that they want.

2652
01:59:07,961 --> 01:59:10,210
I don't think that's the right solution 
to these problems.

2653
01:59:10,340 --> 01:59:12,200
Yeah.
I think the solution in those cases,

2654
01:59:12,201 --> 01:59:15,410
for someone who's got a legitimate 
viewpoint to debate them,

2655
01:59:15,470 --> 01:59:17,330
yeah.
The marketplace of free ideas.

2656
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:22,560
Actually the chancellor at berkeley just
put out a very good statement saying 

2657
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:23,870
exactly that and I gave her credit for 
that.

2658
01:59:23,990 --> 01:59:24,710
Well,
that's great.

2659
01:59:25,010 --> 01:59:30,010
You know,
Because I know that they have an issue 

2660
01:59:30,010 --> 01:59:32,201
there with ben shapiro coming who is a 
very reasonable guy and sometimes gets 

2661
01:59:32,361 --> 01:59:35,090
lumped into the alt right and gets 
lumped into these fees.

2662
01:59:35,091 --> 01:59:40,091
Not that at all.
It just happens to be conservative and 

2663
01:59:40,091 --> 01:59:41,690
young and very articulate,
but for awhile they were trying to limit

2664
01:59:41,691 --> 01:59:44,960
his participation there and putting them
in the same category that they would put

2665
01:59:44,961 --> 01:59:47,330
milo yiannopoulos or of these other guys
here,

2666
01:59:47,370 --> 01:59:52,370
which it's we're,
we're very weird with free speech and 

2667
01:59:52,370 --> 01:59:55,931
that we love free speech as long as it's
in line with how we defend free speech 

2668
01:59:55,931 --> 01:59:57,030
for people we agree with.
Yeah.

2669
01:59:57,040 --> 01:59:57,920
Yeah.

2670
01:59:58,020 --> 01:59:59,430
I mean,
I don't know ben shapiro,

2671
01:59:59,431 --> 02:00:04,431
but Larry Summers is another example.
He gave this famous speech at harvard.

2672
02:00:04,831 --> 02:00:09,831
He was the president of harvard and a 
world famous economist and he gave this 

2673
02:00:09,831 --> 02:00:09,831
speech saying,
well,

2674
02:00:09,831 --> 02:00:14,121
maybe the reason why we don't have as 
many women physicists as male physicist 

2675
02:00:14,121 --> 02:00:18,171
is because of a,
a different distribution of innate 

2676
02:00:18,171 --> 02:00:18,870
abilities.
Now I think that you could make a veRy,

2677
02:00:18,871 --> 02:00:23,070
very good case that his substantive 
claims were entirely bullshit.

2678
02:00:23,130 --> 02:00:28,130
Like he misread the data and he was 
making excuses and that's one thing.

2679
02:00:28,381 --> 02:00:30,810
That's the guy on the street.
It's another thing if it's the president

2680
02:00:30,811 --> 02:00:32,130
of harvard.
Okay.

2681
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:35,550
But then after that,
like people were saying,

2682
02:00:35,551 --> 02:00:40,551
well he shouldn't be invited to give 
talks about economics at other 

2683
02:00:40,551 --> 02:00:41,040
universities because he said this bad 
thing.

2684
02:00:41,041 --> 02:00:42,540
I think that's ridiculous.
He said,

2685
02:00:42,570 --> 02:00:47,570
we're world class economist.
Like he was wrong and you should 

2686
02:00:47,570 --> 02:00:49,971
criticize him,
but I want to hear what he has to say 

2687
02:00:49,971 --> 02:00:49,971
about economics.
That's something that

2688
02:00:49,971 --> 02:00:54,340
entirely different because it also.
There's never an issue with someone 

2689
02:00:54,340 --> 02:00:57,461
who's a professor who's constantly used 
to really not being questioned and been 

2690
02:00:57,461 --> 02:01:02,230
giving lectures and being able to talk 
in front of students and you develop 

2691
02:01:02,230 --> 02:01:04,370
sort of a general hubris about your own 
opinion.

2692
02:01:06,200 --> 02:01:07,830
Well,
I would hope that,

2693
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:09,960
I dunno,
in my areas of academia,

2694
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:14,700
you can't get through lunchtime without 
having all of your opinions at the time.

2695
02:01:14,701 --> 02:01:16,320
Like that's just what we do.
Right?

2696
02:01:16,680 --> 02:01:17,610
Like it's,
you don't,

2697
02:01:17,640 --> 02:01:21,230
you never sit around and say something 
and everyone agrees.

2698
02:01:21,240 --> 02:01:22,830
That seems like a very healthy 
profession.

2699
02:01:22,831 --> 02:01:25,770
Then that's hoW to get things,
get,

2700
02:01:25,771 --> 02:01:30,771
make progress,
but of course usually we're talking 

2701
02:01:30,771 --> 02:01:30,771
about the wave function of the universe,
dark matter.

2702
02:01:30,771 --> 02:01:32,160
Right,
and you know,

2703
02:01:32,370 --> 02:01:33,540
to be very,
very fair.

2704
02:01:33,541 --> 02:01:34,590
There's,
like we said before,

2705
02:01:34,591 --> 02:01:39,591
there's still prejudices about purely 
physics topics like you talk about 

2706
02:01:39,741 --> 02:01:40,010
quantum

2707
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:43,070
mechanics or the nature of the dark 
matter and in discussions get very,

2708
02:01:43,071 --> 02:01:47,990
very heated and emotional and people's 
jobs depend on it and the whole bit.

2709
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:51,680
But the idea that things go unchallenged
is not a.

2710
02:01:51,820 --> 02:01:54,310
That's just doesn't fly very far in this
field.

2711
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:55,730
Well,
that's beautiful.

2712
02:01:55,940 --> 02:01:58,640
I would love to talk to you about what 
you just said,

2713
02:01:58,670 --> 02:02:03,670
dark matter because that's something 
that I would imagine if you went out and

2714
02:02:03,981 --> 02:02:08,981
just randomly polled a thousand people,
all 1000 would have no idea what dark 

2715
02:02:09,651 --> 02:02:11,090
matter is.
Yep.

2716
02:02:11,180 --> 02:02:12,440
There may be gay.
Oh yeah.

2717
02:02:12,441 --> 02:02:14,630
It's like part of the universe.
It's really.

2718
02:02:14,900 --> 02:02:16,590
We can't find it,
but it's.

2719
02:02:16,990 --> 02:02:21,990
I think it was rick and morty recently 
that had a silly episode about dark 

2720
02:02:21,990 --> 02:02:21,990
matter.
It's a,

2721
02:02:21,990 --> 02:02:23,270
it's a cartoon,
a cartoon network.

2722
02:02:23,271 --> 02:02:25,220
Show a.
It's a hilarious,

2723
02:02:25,221 --> 02:02:28,600
silly thing that uses science fiction to
to,

2724
02:02:28,730 --> 02:02:30,630
to actually do that.

2725
02:02:30,710 --> 02:02:35,710
Yeah.
I think I know what you're talking 

2726
02:02:35,710 --> 02:02:35,710
about.
Dark matter is real.

2727
02:02:35,710 --> 02:02:35,710
It exists.
Yes.

2728
02:02:35,710 --> 02:02:35,710
Okay.
How do we measure it?

2729
02:02:36,380 --> 02:02:40,700
We measure its gravitational force.
It pushes things around in the universe.

2730
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:43,790
So what do we think it is that we don't 
know?

2731
02:02:43,791 --> 02:02:44,780
That's the.
That's the thing.

2732
02:02:44,781 --> 02:02:48,080
We know certain things about it.
We know that it's dark.

2733
02:02:48,710 --> 02:02:53,710
We know how much of it there is.
It's about five times as much mass in 

2734
02:02:54,021 --> 02:02:56,240
dark matter.
Then there is an ordinary matter.

2735
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:58,850
Ordinary matter is every particle we've 
ever seen ever,

2736
02:02:58,910 --> 02:03:00,590
right?
So all of the atoms,

2737
02:03:00,591 --> 02:03:05,591
all the stores,
all the galaxies that we see in our 

2738
02:03:05,591 --> 02:03:05,591
telescopes,
that's five percent of the mass,

2739
02:03:05,770 --> 02:03:09,830
and then dark matter is 25 percent and 
dark energy,

2740
02:03:09,831 --> 02:03:14,831
which is something completely different 
is the other 70 percent of the universe 

2741
02:03:14,831 --> 02:03:15,770
and these,
those are facts.

2742
02:03:15,830 --> 02:03:17,990
Those that's basically,
you know,

2743
02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:20,180
99 percent likely to be true.

2744
02:03:20,510 --> 02:03:22,160
What it is,
the dark matter,

2745
02:03:22,161 --> 02:03:27,161
the dark energy that is much more up in 
the air that we have lots of candidates 

2746
02:03:27,161 --> 02:03:27,670
and we're not sure which one is right.
Boy,

2747
02:03:27,740 --> 02:03:28,820
that doesn't help,
does it?

2748
02:03:29,160 --> 02:03:29,820
Well,
you know,

2749
02:03:30,410 --> 02:03:31,990
so I went on science friday,
you know,

2750
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,700
science friday with a ira playdough npr 
show.

2751
02:03:34,720 --> 02:03:35,940
Okay.
Um,

2752
02:03:36,110 --> 02:03:38,300
and he says,
he says like you,

2753
02:03:38,301 --> 02:03:39,410
cosmologist,
like,

2754
02:03:39,470 --> 02:03:44,470
shouldn't you be embarrassed?
You only understand five percent of 

2755
02:03:44,470 --> 02:03:44,470
what's in the universe.
It's amazing.

2756
02:03:44,470 --> 02:03:45,210
They know that much.
We know five percent of us,

2757
02:03:45,630 --> 02:03:50,630
the universe,
like 100 years ago we didn't know 

2758
02:03:50,630 --> 02:03:52,901
anything about the universe.
We didn't know the universe was 

2759
02:03:52,901 --> 02:03:52,901
expanding.
We didn't really ever other galaxies,

2760
02:03:52,901 --> 02:03:52,901
you know,
come on.

2761
02:03:52,901 --> 02:03:57,761
This stuff takes more than a few months 
to figure out five percent I think is 

2762
02:03:57,761 --> 02:03:57,761
pretty healthy.
Yeah,

2763
02:03:57,761 --> 02:04:01,990
I think we're getting there.
What is the current theory as to like 

2764
02:04:01,990 --> 02:04:06,430
where it resides and how it's formed and
what its properties are and what impact 

2765
02:04:07,251 --> 02:04:09,350
it has on the galaxies?
I think this is a really,

2766
02:04:09,351 --> 02:04:14,351
really good question because we might be
in flux right now for a long time.

2767
02:04:14,511 --> 02:04:16,670
Like basically from the 19 eighties to 
today,

2768
02:04:17,090 --> 02:04:19,970
there was a leading candidate for what 
the dark matter was,

2769
02:04:19,971 --> 02:04:23,930
something called the wimp,
weakly interacting massive particle.

2770
02:04:24,830 --> 02:04:28,460
So if you indulge me for just a second,
we have the particles we know and love.

2771
02:04:28,640 --> 02:04:33,640
Uh,
there are four forces that push these 

2772
02:04:33,640 --> 02:04:33,640
particles around.
There's gravity,

2773
02:04:33,640 --> 02:04:38,140
electromagnetism,
and then there's the strong and weak 

2774
02:04:38,140 --> 02:04:38,190
nuclear forces to nuclear forces.

2775
02:04:38,190 --> 02:04:40,920
And the nuclear forces are distinguished
by being short range,

2776
02:04:40,950 --> 02:04:42,330
like you don't notice it in your 
everyday life.

2777
02:04:42,331 --> 02:04:44,370
You gotta be down there at the atomic 
scale.

2778
02:04:44,910 --> 02:04:49,910
So it turns out that if you imagine a 
new particle that obviously interacts 

2779
02:04:50,371 --> 02:04:55,371
through gravity because everything 
interacts through gravity but doesn't 

2780
02:04:55,371 --> 02:04:57,570
interact through the strong nuclear 
force like a proton does,

2781
02:04:57,571 --> 02:04:59,910
or through electromagnetism that will be
charged,

2782
02:05:00,210 --> 02:05:02,610
but it interacts through the weak 
nuclear force.

2783
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,630
Okay?
So you imagine a particle interacts with

2784
02:05:05,640 --> 02:05:10,640
the weak nuclear force relatively heavy,
and you calculate how much of those 

2785
02:05:10,771 --> 02:05:15,771
should be leftover from the big bang.
You get the right amount to be the dark 

2786
02:05:15,771 --> 02:05:19,050
matter.
So this is called the wimp miracle.

2787
02:05:19,530 --> 02:05:22,200
The idea that if you just hypothesize 
out of the blue,

2788
02:05:22,260 --> 02:05:27,260
a new particle that is invisible and 
stable and interacts through the known 

2789
02:05:27,260 --> 02:05:29,250
force of nature that we call the weak 
nuclear force,

2790
02:05:29,251 --> 02:05:30,750
that could easily be the dark matter.

2791
02:05:31,410 --> 02:05:33,990
So that was seemed so natural and 
simple,

2792
02:05:33,991 --> 02:05:38,991
and there were many more complicated 
theories that predicted that such 

2793
02:05:38,991 --> 02:05:40,410
particles would exist.
I would say that many people,

2794
02:05:40,530 --> 02:05:45,530
10 years ago or so,
I would have said there's a 90 percent 

2795
02:05:45,530 --> 02:05:46,020
chance that wimps,
weakly interacting massive particles are

2796
02:05:46,021 --> 02:05:48,240
the dark manner.
Here's the problem.

2797
02:05:49,110 --> 02:05:51,360
If the wimps,
if the dark matter is wimps,

2798
02:05:51,870 --> 02:05:54,000
we can build detectors and look for 
them.

2799
02:05:54,510 --> 02:05:57,840
And we have done that.
We've built these giant detectors,

2800
02:05:57,841 --> 02:06:01,050
deep underground.
You're shielded from all the cosmic rays

2801
02:06:01,051 --> 02:06:03,660
that are just noise and contaminating 
your experiment,

2802
02:06:04,060 --> 02:06:09,060
uh,
and you wait for a little weakly 

2803
02:06:09,060 --> 02:06:11,181
interacting,
massive particle to pass through your 

2804
02:06:11,181 --> 02:06:11,970
detector and bump into an atom 
underground underground.

2805
02:06:12,890 --> 02:06:14,970
Uh,
usually these are in minds,

2806
02:06:15,090 --> 02:06:16,920
right?
So they're an old gold mines,

2807
02:06:16,921 --> 02:06:18,880
a mile underground,
counterintuitive.

2808
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:22,860
So you're going a mile underground to 
search for something that's in space.

2809
02:06:22,950 --> 02:06:24,210
I made up the mile.
You might want to,

2810
02:06:24,211 --> 02:06:28,430
if you can get even 100 feet underground
in a deep mine,

2811
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:33,520
it seems so counterintuitive.
You'd think you'd have to throw 

2812
02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:36,381
something into the sky,
live in a noisy environment that the 

2813
02:06:36,381 --> 02:06:37,260
trouble is not detecting them.
The trouble is seeing them peek out over

2814
02:06:37,261 --> 02:06:39,420
the noise.
That's what we're trying to do.

2815
02:06:39,421 --> 02:06:41,610
It's like going into a quiet room to 
listen to something very,

2816
02:06:41,611 --> 02:06:46,611
very well.
Was the initial discovery that led to 

2817
02:06:46,611 --> 02:06:50,340
the conclusion that dark matter is the 
preeminent mass of the universe.

2818
02:06:50,341 --> 02:06:51,920
Like what?
What percentage of the masses?

2819
02:06:51,930 --> 02:06:52,430
It will.
Sorry,

2820
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:55,380
let me just finish this up very quickly 
because this point is that we have built

2821
02:06:55,381 --> 02:06:57,090
these detectors and we haven't seen the 
wimps.

2822
02:06:57,270 --> 02:06:57,840
Oh,
okay.

2823
02:06:57,841 --> 02:07:02,841
So for the first time people are 
beginning to shake their belief that 

2824
02:07:02,841 --> 02:07:04,050
maybe wimps are the most likely 
candidate.

2825
02:07:04,260 --> 02:07:06,120
There are other candidates,
other kinds of particles.

2826
02:07:06,121 --> 02:07:08,420
That could be the dark matter.
Maybe it's still winds.

2827
02:07:08,440 --> 02:07:10,920
We just haven't found them yet.
That's still possible,

2828
02:07:11,310 --> 02:07:14,340
but I would say if five years from now 
we haven't found the wimps,

2829
02:07:14,370 --> 02:07:16,530
then people are gonna start saying it's 
something else.

2830
02:07:17,490 --> 02:07:19,230
Okay,
so the first evidence,

2831
02:07:19,320 --> 02:07:20,010
uh,
well,

2832
02:07:20,011 --> 02:07:21,510
you know,
it comes in drips and drabs.

2833
02:07:21,530 --> 02:07:23,670
My,
my caltech predecessor,

2834
02:07:23,671 --> 02:07:27,870
fritz zwicky famous astrophysicist back 
in the 19 thirties,

2835
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:33,440
pointed out that galaxies were orbiting 
each other too fast in what are called 

2836
02:07:33,601 --> 02:07:35,860
clusters of galaxies.
You look out there in the sky,

2837
02:07:35,861 --> 02:07:40,861
you see like these bunches of galaxies 
that are orbiting each other and you 

2838
02:07:40,861 --> 02:07:42,250
calculate how heavy the galaxies should 
be from what you see.

2839
02:07:42,460 --> 02:07:45,460
You can calculate using newtonian laws 
of physics,

2840
02:07:45,461 --> 02:07:49,180
how fast they should be orbiting.
They're actually orbiting much faster.

2841
02:07:49,600 --> 02:07:54,600
And he said the only way for that to 
happen is if they're much more massive 

2842
02:07:54,600 --> 02:07:54,600
than youth on.

2843
02:07:54,600 --> 02:07:57,400
if there's much more mass in there,
there's some missing mass.

2844
02:07:57,550 --> 02:08:02,550
Okay.
But at the time we didn't know it could 

2845
02:08:02,550 --> 02:08:03,010
just be stars that we didn't see or gas 
or dust or whatever.

2846
02:08:03,370 --> 02:08:08,370
it wasn't really until the 19 seventies 
that vera rubin famous astrophysicist 

2847
02:08:08,370 --> 02:08:13,290
looked at how individual galaxies are 
rotating and she found that it's a 

2848
02:08:13,290 --> 02:08:16,450
similar kind of thing.
The edges of the galaxies are moving way

2849
02:08:16,451 --> 02:08:20,440
faster than they should be given the 
amount of matter that is inside.

2850
02:08:20,470 --> 02:08:25,390
And she concluded that a lot of dark 
matter causing a gravitational pull that

2851
02:08:25,391 --> 02:08:29,230
we didn't see but is causing this,
the edges of the galaxies to spend a lot

2852
02:08:29,231 --> 02:08:31,420
faster than they should be.
Wow.

2853
02:08:31,480 --> 02:08:36,480
so that is the reason why.
Is there a possibility that some new 

2854
02:08:36,641 --> 02:08:41,641
discovery could happen or could come 
forth where you would re examine this 

2855
02:08:42,281 --> 02:08:45,850
idea that there's some missing mass is 
always a possibility.

2856
02:08:46,180 --> 02:08:47,230
Um,
I,

2857
02:08:47,260 --> 02:08:52,260
so there's certainly this idea that is 
on the market that because all of our 

2858
02:08:53,291 --> 02:08:58,291
evidence for dark matter is indirect 
because it's through it's gravitational 

2859
02:08:58,291 --> 02:09:02,761
influence,
not by directly touching it or seeing 

2860
02:09:02,761 --> 02:09:02,761
it.
Maybe we just don't understand gravity.

2861
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:06,520
Maybe gravity is a little bit different 
now.

2862
02:09:06,521 --> 02:09:08,290
I would argue,
and I think I'm right,

2863
02:09:08,470 --> 02:09:10,330
not everyone agrees with me sadly.
But,

2864
02:09:10,680 --> 02:09:15,680
uh,
that idea has basically been killed off 

2865
02:09:15,680 --> 02:09:18,190
by our observations of the microwave 
background radiation.

2866
02:09:18,310 --> 02:09:23,310
You know,
we are 14 billion years after the big 

2867
02:09:23,310 --> 02:09:23,310
bang there was,
you know,

2868
02:09:23,310 --> 02:09:25,120
the big bang was very,
very hot and dense.

2869
02:09:25,121 --> 02:09:27,190
And is glowing to beat the band 
everywhere,

2870
02:09:27,191 --> 02:09:32,191
but it was also opaque.
The light didn't get very far and about 

2871
02:09:32,191 --> 02:09:36,780
400,000
years after the big bang it cooled down 

2872
02:09:36,780 --> 02:09:36,780
enough,
it became transparent.

2873
02:09:36,880 --> 02:09:38,010
And then these,
this,

2874
02:09:38,080 --> 02:09:42,130
these photons of light just stretched 
travel through the universe unimpeded.

2875
02:09:42,130 --> 02:09:44,230
And we can see that the leftoveR 
radiation,

2876
02:09:44,260 --> 02:09:49,260
we can see these faint patterns,
these oscillations in the microwave 

2877
02:09:49,260 --> 02:09:54,001
background,
which look exactly like they would look 

2878
02:09:54,001 --> 02:09:57,031
if dark matter we're causing them and 
they don't look what they would look 

2879
02:09:57,031 --> 02:10:00,220
like if gravity were modified.
So there's a much longer version of that

2880
02:10:00,221 --> 02:10:01,980
story.
But the basic thing is if you,

2881
02:10:01,990 --> 02:10:04,330
if I can just pull authority and say,
trust me on this,

2882
02:10:04,590 --> 02:10:05,860
uh,
I was,

2883
02:10:05,980 --> 02:10:10,980
I was totally on board with the idea 
that there was something wrong about 

2884
02:10:10,980 --> 02:10:10,980
gravity.
That'd be very cool thing.

2885
02:10:10,980 --> 02:10:15,421
If it were true,
there'll be a big mind bending 

2886
02:10:15,421 --> 02:10:17,821
discovery.
But we've tested that and the microwave 

2887
02:10:17,821 --> 02:10:17,821
background,
there were predictions.

2888
02:10:17,821 --> 02:10:19,870
It would look this way if you modified 
gravity that way,

2889
02:10:19,871 --> 02:10:24,871
if there were dark matter and the answer
is spot on to the dark matter of 

2890
02:10:24,871 --> 02:10:25,960
predictions.
Very different from the modified gravity

2891
02:10:25,961 --> 02:10:27,970
predictions.
So dark matter exists.

2892
02:10:28,030 --> 02:10:33,030
So dark matter exists.
And what percentage of the universe is 

2893
02:10:33,030 --> 02:10:34,220
currently believed to be matter?
Twenty five percent.

2894
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:38,300
Twenty five percent.
And I read once that they had discovered

2895
02:10:38,301 --> 02:10:41,630
in entire galaxy that was made out of 
dark matter.

2896
02:10:43,070 --> 02:10:44,360
Yeah,
pretty close.

2897
02:10:44,390 --> 02:10:46,610
MayBe not entirely because then you 
wouldn't see it,

2898
02:10:46,890 --> 02:10:48,260
right?
It's hard to discover it.

2899
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:51,500
That was what I was going to ask.
How do you see this stuff?

2900
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:54,950
Like how does,
like how if you can't detect it,

2901
02:10:54,960 --> 02:10:56,630
if you will,
you know it exists,

2902
02:10:56,631 --> 02:10:57,260
right?
But you know,

2903
02:10:57,261 --> 02:10:58,750
because of its effects,
that's a,

2904
02:10:58,790 --> 02:11:00,680
you don't,
you can't like point to it.

2905
02:11:00,681 --> 02:11:02,120
Like you can point to the sun,
right?

2906
02:11:02,450 --> 02:11:07,450
So you need some tracers,
you need something that tells you that 

2907
02:11:07,450 --> 02:11:08,110
dark matter is influencing the motion of
stuff in this,

2908
02:11:08,130 --> 02:11:11,090
this mdm space.
So in a galaxy,

2909
02:11:11,091 --> 02:11:16,091
it's just like the stars at the edges of
the galaxy and most of the mass in our 

2910
02:11:16,091 --> 02:11:20,711
galaxy is dark matter.
Like we see the pictures of galaxies 

2911
02:11:20,711 --> 02:11:20,711
that you see that look very beautiful.

2912
02:11:20,711 --> 02:11:23,120
The actual size of the galaxy is much 
bigger than that,

2913
02:11:23,330 --> 02:11:28,330
but it's all dark matter.
The galaxy you see is a tiny little 

2914
02:11:28,330 --> 02:11:28,330
puddle,
you know,

2915
02:11:28,330 --> 02:11:33,040
one fifth of the total mass,
let it sort of settled down to the 

2916
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:34,700
center of this big puffy cloud of dark 
matter.

2917
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:36,980
Whoa.
And the.

2918
02:11:37,010 --> 02:11:37,940
When people say,
well,

2919
02:11:37,941 --> 02:11:40,220
there's a galaxy that is only dark 
matter.

2920
02:11:40,221 --> 02:11:43,280
What they really mean is it's almost 
only dark matter.

2921
02:11:43,430 --> 02:11:48,430
It's a puffy coat or dark matter where 
most of the stars have been pushed out 

2922
02:11:48,430 --> 02:11:49,970
by something.
But some of the stars or the gas you can

2923
02:11:49,971 --> 02:11:53,480
still see orbiting around and that tells
you there's a some concentration of dark

2924
02:11:53,481 --> 02:11:56,980
matter there.
Do we know what dark matter is or does?

2925
02:11:56,981 --> 02:11:57,710
There is.
There are.

2926
02:11:58,020 --> 02:12:00,620
There's lots of theories.
Chimps were the biggest theory,

2927
02:12:00,650 --> 02:12:03,350
but there's alternatives.
There's one alternative.

2928
02:12:03,351 --> 02:12:08,351
It could be small black holes that were 
made in the very early universe that 

2929
02:12:08,351 --> 02:12:09,050
seems unlikely.

2930
02:12:09,500 --> 02:12:12,920
There's another kind of subatomic 
particle called the axion,

2931
02:12:13,310 --> 02:12:18,310
which is nice because people invented it
for totally different reasons and they 

2932
02:12:18,310 --> 02:12:21,911
also worked out that could give you 
exactly the right abundance to be the 

2933
02:12:21,911 --> 02:12:21,911
dark matter.
And there's a whole,

2934
02:12:21,911 --> 02:12:21,950
there's the,
You know,

2935
02:12:21,990 --> 02:12:24,680
dozens of different theories out there 
for what it could be.

2936
02:12:24,681 --> 02:12:29,681
So we're looking,
we're trying to figure out which one is 

2937
02:12:29,681 --> 02:12:31,421
right.
What a weird thing to have something 

2938
02:12:31,421 --> 02:12:34,511
that's invisible.
That's a giant percentage of the entire 

2939
02:12:34,511 --> 02:12:35,570
universe in a large percentage of 
galaxies,

2940
02:12:35,571 --> 02:12:35,910
right?
Yeah.

2941
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:40,910
Percentage of galaxies as dark matter 
most nineties in the nineties.

2942
02:12:40,911 --> 02:12:41,570
Yeah.
well,

2943
02:12:41,571 --> 02:12:43,340
uh,
let's say 75 percent,

2944
02:12:43,341 --> 02:12:48,341
80 percent,
something like that depends on the 

2945
02:12:48,341 --> 02:12:48,341
galaxy,
but uh,

2946
02:12:48,341 --> 02:12:53,080
on the other hand,
what right to be think that we have to 

2947
02:12:53,080 --> 02:12:53,450
think that most of the universe should 
be readily visible to us.

2948
02:12:53,540 --> 02:12:58,540
Now,
does dark matter exists on earth or is 

2949
02:12:58,540 --> 02:12:58,540
it only in deep space?

2950
02:12:58,540 --> 02:13:01,550
It depends on what the right theory of 
dark matter is.

2951
02:13:01,720 --> 02:13:06,720
But in most theories,
there are dark matter particles passing 

2952
02:13:06,720 --> 02:13:09,581
through your body right now.
So with this wimps detection theory of 

2953
02:13:09,581 --> 02:13:12,560
where they've developed these detectors 
deep in the ground,

2954
02:13:13,070 --> 02:13:16,910
would that would be able to detect 
something that's actually prevalent here

2955
02:13:16,911 --> 02:13:17,780
on earth?
Yes.

2956
02:13:18,230 --> 02:13:19,820
And it's not that they're stuck to here 
on earth,

2957
02:13:19,850 --> 02:13:21,860
there were,
the earth is just moving through space,

2958
02:13:22,020 --> 02:13:27,020
so there's a wind of dark matter 
particles that were passing through and 

2959
02:13:27,020 --> 02:13:31,690
occasionally bumping into and we're 
moving in some sort of a spiral through 

2960
02:13:31,690 --> 02:13:31,980
the moving and we're orbiting

2961
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:32,790
around the sun,
right?

2962
02:13:32,900 --> 02:13:35,240
Yeah.
Now the,

2963
02:13:35,250 --> 02:13:37,620
the,
the Big bang one is another weird one.

2964
02:13:37,780 --> 02:13:42,780
um,
because I was watching this thing on 

2965
02:13:42,780 --> 02:13:44,580
television that was proposing 
alternative theories to the big bang and

2966
02:13:44,581 --> 02:13:49,581
one of them was that the universe is 
next to another universe and that 

2967
02:13:49,581 --> 02:13:52,290
somehow or another it collided with this
universe.

2968
02:13:52,590 --> 02:13:56,100
And that this is a probably a process 
that repeats itself.

2969
02:13:56,130 --> 02:13:58,950
I know we get paid to come up with these
ideas and that's what we're doing.

2970
02:13:58,980 --> 02:14:00,930
you know,
they're in starbucks with the pencil and

2971
02:14:00,931 --> 02:14:01,680
paper.
Yes.

2972
02:14:01,710 --> 02:14:03,570
What do you buy iNto that?
Like which one do you

2973
02:14:03,590 --> 02:14:05,080
by handling it works?
No,

2974
02:14:05,150 --> 02:14:07,100
I don't personally think that that's 
very likely.

2975
02:14:07,101 --> 02:14:08,780
It's on the table.
It's a reasonable.

2976
02:14:08,810 --> 02:14:10,550
Is it still on?
Is it a recent.

2977
02:14:10,551 --> 02:14:11,620
Yeah.
Um,

2978
02:14:12,550 --> 02:14:14,300
uh,
when was it first suggested?

2979
02:14:14,330 --> 02:14:15,800
Maybe around the $2,000
or so.

2980
02:14:16,030 --> 02:14:21,030
And did it,
did a bunch of people jump on board or 

2981
02:14:21,030 --> 02:14:21,030
wouldn't say save something like that 
comes up.

2982
02:14:21,030 --> 02:14:25,321
One of your colleagues has this idea,
so then you go to the cafe with your 

2983
02:14:25,321 --> 02:14:25,660
legal pad and gore and how do we do 
this?

2984
02:14:25,720 --> 02:14:26,530
exactly.
That's right.

2985
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:31,310
And so what you would do in that case,
so someone proposed an idea and you say,

2986
02:14:31,311 --> 02:14:31,700
well,
okay,

2987
02:14:31,701 --> 02:14:33,560
how would we test it?
How would we know?

2988
02:14:33,620 --> 02:14:34,820
Well,
maybe,

2989
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:36,620
uh,
like we said before,

2990
02:14:36,621 --> 02:14:41,621
maybe it predicts some pattern in the 
leftover microwave background radiation 

2991
02:14:41,621 --> 02:14:45,880
from the big bang.
If you're a different theory for what 

2992
02:14:45,880 --> 02:14:46,790
happened at the big bang,
then maybe your imprint post big bang is

2993
02:14:46,791 --> 02:14:51,791
a little bit different.
And that's exactly the kind of thing 

2994
02:14:51,791 --> 02:14:51,791
we're looking for now.
So

2995
02:14:51,791 --> 02:14:53,020
the imprint,
the microwave imprint of the Big bang,

2996
02:14:53,021 --> 02:14:56,030
this 14 billion year old event.
Yeah,

2997
02:14:56,380 --> 02:15:01,380
what is the,
like terence mckenna had a fucking 

2998
02:15:01,380 --> 02:15:04,081
hilarious way of describing it.
I do a terrible job of butchering it,

2999
02:15:04,600 --> 02:15:05,370
but,
um,

3000
02:15:06,370 --> 02:15:08,850
that people like,

3001
02:15:09,900 --> 02:15:14,900
it's funny how he was talking about how 
many scientists are atheists that they 

3002
02:15:14,900 --> 02:15:16,500
don't want to believe in god they don't 
want to in.

3003
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:18,960
He was an atheist as well.
He was an atheist rather as well.

3004
02:15:19,200 --> 02:15:19,620
But,
uh,

3005
02:15:19,621 --> 02:15:20,520
he said,
but they are,

3006
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:25,760
they do want you to believe that 
everything came out of nothing for no 

3007
02:15:25,760 --> 02:15:30,621
reason that anybody knows of 14 billion 
years ago there was this infinitely 

3008
02:15:30,621 --> 02:15:33,930
small area that was smaller than the 
head of a pin.

3009
02:15:34,410 --> 02:15:39,300
And that's everything you see in the sky
and it exploded 14 billion years ago and

3010
02:15:39,301 --> 02:15:40,530
no one knows why.
That's right,

3011
02:15:40,620 --> 02:15:42,290
yes.
Good.

3012
02:15:43,590 --> 02:15:46,170
but isn't that a mean?
That is so crazy.

3013
02:15:46,350 --> 02:15:49,170
And you know,
it's one of those things that theorists,

3014
02:15:49,410 --> 02:15:49,840
you know,
uh,

3015
02:15:49,860 --> 02:15:53,220
people that are really into a god's 
religion,

3016
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:54,900
they point to like,
well,

3017
02:15:54,901 --> 02:15:56,550
this is the scientists.
God,

3018
02:15:56,760 --> 02:15:58,260
this is this,
this event,

3019
02:15:58,261 --> 02:15:59,700
this is a miracle.
I mean,

3020
02:15:59,701 --> 02:16:04,701
this is the way bigger miracle than 
walking on water or turning wine into 

3021
02:16:04,701 --> 02:16:05,370
water,
into wine.

3022
02:16:05,580 --> 02:16:05,980
I mean,
that's

3023
02:16:06,360 --> 02:16:07,770
baby stuff.
Exactly.

3024
02:16:07,810 --> 02:16:12,390
That this scenario would be 100 percent 
compatible with the laws of physics in a

3025
02:16:12,391 --> 02:16:14,070
way that turning water into wine.
He's kind of not.

3026
02:16:14,660 --> 02:16:17,220
Yeah,
I think that the.

3027
02:16:17,250 --> 02:16:22,250
So here's the thing,
and I think this is actually not always 

3028
02:16:22,250 --> 02:16:23,880
communicated very well.
The big bang is the phrase,

3029
02:16:23,881 --> 02:16:25,680
the big bang Is used in two different 
senses.

3030
02:16:26,430 --> 02:16:31,430
One is what we call the big bang model,
which is the whole history of the 

3031
02:16:31,430 --> 02:16:33,760
universe for the last 14 billion years 
from an original hot,

3032
02:16:33,820 --> 02:16:37,270
dense state expanding cooling galaxies 
form.

3033
02:16:37,271 --> 02:16:38,980
Here we are.
That's true.

3034
02:16:39,370 --> 02:16:41,140
That's settled.
Not art.

3035
02:16:41,230 --> 02:16:42,280
We know that.
That's right.

3036
02:16:42,281 --> 02:16:43,360
Okay.
The big bang model,

3037
02:16:43,720 --> 02:16:45,910
but then there's also the big bang 
event.

3038
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,970
The beginning of that story time equals 
zero.

3039
02:16:48,971 --> 02:16:52,360
The initial singularity,
it's a prediction.

3040
02:16:52,361 --> 02:16:52,990
If you,
again,

3041
02:16:52,991 --> 02:16:55,510
if you remember we talked about in black
holes,

3042
02:16:55,511 --> 02:16:59,110
you have general relativity,
einstein's theory of gravity.

3043
02:16:59,800 --> 02:17:01,810
It makes predictions and one of those 
predictions,

3044
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:04,330
if you trace the universe backward in 
time,

3045
02:17:04,331 --> 02:17:09,331
you hit a singularity,
you hit a moment when everything was 

3046
02:17:09,331 --> 02:17:10,180
infinitely dense,
infinitely fast expanding,

3047
02:17:10,181 --> 02:17:10,930
et cetera,
et cetera.

3048
02:17:11,860 --> 02:17:14,890
That's the bIg bang moment and it is 
certainly not true.

3049
02:17:15,460 --> 02:17:16,860
it's the opposite of true.
It's,

3050
02:17:16,861 --> 02:17:21,861
it's.
It has no right to believe that that 

3051
02:17:21,861 --> 02:17:22,630
actually happened because it's a 
prediction of general relativity,

3052
02:17:22,840 --> 02:17:27,840
but general tiffany's not right in that 
regime because you're ignoring quantum 

3053
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:31,291
mechanics once again.
So if you don't think that you 

3054
02:17:31,291 --> 02:17:33,070
understand the fundamental quantum 
mechanical rules of the universe,

3055
02:17:33,220 --> 02:17:38,220
you have no right to say what happened 
at the big bang and what physicists 

3056
02:17:38,220 --> 02:17:42,541
should say if they're being honest,
is that could be that there was a first 

3057
02:17:43,031 --> 02:17:46,150
moment in the history of the universe,
the first moment of time,

3058
02:17:46,660 --> 02:17:51,370
a day without a yesterday,
and once we understand quantum mechanics

3059
02:17:51,371 --> 02:17:53,170
and gravity and how they play well 
together,

3060
02:17:53,171 --> 02:17:54,430
that will all be very clear.

3061
02:17:54,790 --> 02:17:57,280
Or there could have been something 
before.

3062
02:17:57,580 --> 02:17:58,750
You know.
There could be the,

3063
02:17:58,810 --> 02:18:01,090
what we call the big bang,
may have been just a phase.

3064
02:18:01,091 --> 02:18:04,750
The universe goes through occasionally 
and this bouncing universe idea that you

3065
02:18:04,751 --> 02:18:09,751
were talking about with the two 
different universities hitting each 

3066
02:18:09,751 --> 02:18:11,581
other,
that would be an example of a scenario 

3067
02:18:11,581 --> 02:18:14,641
in which the universe was eternal,
that it lasted forever and right now we 

3068
02:18:14,641 --> 02:18:16,360
have no way of knowing.
We're very openminded.

3069
02:18:16,450 --> 02:18:19,090
It's 14 billion years ago.
Maybe it was the beginning,

3070
02:18:19,091 --> 02:18:20,350
maybe it wasn't.
We just don't know.

3071
02:18:20,710 --> 02:18:22,610
What do you take?
Um,

3072
02:18:23,170 --> 02:18:28,170
of the idea that the big bang is process
a continual expansion and contraction 

3073
02:18:30,191 --> 02:18:32,620
process and that it starts with the big 
bang,

3074
02:18:32,860 --> 02:18:37,860
the universe expands and then somehow in
other polls back into itself until it 

3075
02:18:37,860 --> 02:18:40,060
becomes this incredibly dense small 
point again.

3076
02:18:40,210 --> 02:18:42,010
And then the whole process starts from 
scratch,

3077
02:18:42,160 --> 02:18:42,430
right?

3078
02:18:42,460 --> 02:18:47,460
Yeah.
That's one of the scenarios on the 

3079
02:18:47,460 --> 02:18:47,460
table.
Um,

3080
02:18:47,460 --> 02:18:47,460
in fact,
this,

3081
02:18:47,460 --> 02:18:51,250
this idea that you referred to,
which was what was originally called the

3082
02:18:51,251 --> 02:18:56,251
egg pie erotic universe.
Don't ask why it was some ancient 

3083
02:18:56,251 --> 02:18:56,251
greeks.
Cool name.

3084
02:18:56,251 --> 02:18:56,251
Yeah.
It's a cool word name.

3085
02:18:56,251 --> 02:19:01,111
So that was the idea.
There's this extra dimension in two 

3086
02:19:01,111 --> 02:19:02,170
universes of smacking into each other.
They later realized the same people,

3087
02:19:02,230 --> 02:19:07,230
very well known,
respectable physicists realized they 

3088
02:19:07,230 --> 02:19:10,051
could just play the game over and over 
again so you could have this smacking 

3089
02:19:10,051 --> 02:19:11,590
together call that the big bang,
it expands and cools,

3090
02:19:11,591 --> 02:19:16,591
but then it recontract and there's 
another bounce and just goes on an 

3091
02:19:16,591 --> 02:19:20,671
infinite number of times.
I am personally not that fond of this 

3092
02:19:20,671 --> 02:19:20,671
idea.
Number one,

3093
02:19:20,671 --> 02:19:25,651
there's no evidence whatsoever or reason
to believe that our universe will ever 

3094
02:19:25,651 --> 02:19:26,230
contract,
if not only expanding,

3095
02:19:26,231 --> 02:19:31,231
but it's expanding and faster as doing 
the opposite of what you would expect 

3096
02:19:31,231 --> 02:19:32,120
for we're going to contract,
so I don't think that's very likely.

3097
02:19:32,960 --> 02:19:37,960
And number two,
the single most impressive empirical 

3098
02:19:37,960 --> 02:19:42,611
fact about the universe is the 
difference between the past and the 

3099
02:19:42,611 --> 02:19:42,611
future,
what we call the arrow of time,

3100
02:19:42,611 --> 02:19:43,630
right?
A,

3101
02:19:43,640 --> 02:19:45,740
you remember the past,
but not the future.

3102
02:19:45,980 --> 02:19:48,020
You make choices now that affect the 
future,

3103
02:19:48,021 --> 02:19:53,021
but not the past.
So this difference between the past and 

3104
02:19:53,021 --> 02:19:54,980
future is nowhere built into the laws of
physics as we know them.

3105
02:19:54,981 --> 02:19:58,310
All the laws of physics that we know 
treat the past and future the same.

3106
02:19:59,240 --> 02:20:02,030
The reason why there's a difference is 
because of the big bang,

3107
02:20:02,080 --> 02:20:07,080
because the big bang was a very,
very special organized state that the 

3108
02:20:07,080 --> 02:20:11,741
universe could be in and ever since then
we have been expanding and cooling and 

3109
02:20:11,741 --> 02:20:16,661
sort of winding down and that's the fact
you have to explain if you want to 

3110
02:20:17,121 --> 02:20:22,121
explain the origin of the universe in my
view and the idea that there's an 

3111
02:20:22,121 --> 02:20:23,120
infinite number of cycles.
Doesn't explain that fact at all.

3112
02:20:24,750 --> 02:20:26,940
There you go.
Lawrence krauss was trying to explain to

3113
02:20:26,941 --> 02:20:31,941
me the size of the universe and the age 
of the universe and he was saying that 

3114
02:20:32,280 --> 02:20:37,280
14 billion years,
like when we look back into the known 

3115
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:37,320
universe,
like the,

3116
02:20:37,440 --> 02:20:39,600
what we can say is like 14 billion 
years,

3117
02:20:39,900 --> 02:20:44,900
but he was saying that that essentially 
doesn't mean that that's as far back as 

3118
02:20:45,601 --> 02:20:50,601
it exists.
It just means that space is moving 

3119
02:20:50,601 --> 02:20:52,380
faster than light.
when you get back to that distance,

3120
02:20:52,381 --> 02:20:54,750
there might be something even further 
back than that,

3121
02:20:54,751 --> 02:20:56,280
but we're not going to ever be able to 
see it.

3122
02:20:56,910 --> 02:20:59,490
I hope he didn't say exactly that.
I'm sure he did.

3123
02:20:59,670 --> 02:21:01,080
Right,
so fuck that up,

3124
02:21:01,081 --> 02:21:01,560
I'm sure.

3125
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:06,600
But again,
sometimes even my favorite people in 

3126
02:21:06,600 --> 02:21:08,590
cosmology used this language of space 
expanding faster than light.

3127
02:21:09,370 --> 02:21:12,610
Entirely bullshit because space doesn't 
have the speed.

3128
02:21:13,390 --> 02:21:16,480
The expansion of space is the answer to 
the question.

3129
02:21:16,481 --> 02:21:18,430
You know,
spaces this big.

3130
02:21:18,730 --> 02:21:21,100
By whaT amount has it expanded in

3131
02:21:21,190 --> 02:21:22,540
one year?
One second later,

3132
02:21:22,570 --> 02:21:24,490
right?
I have heard that expression before,

3133
02:21:24,491 --> 02:21:26,920
that space is moving faster than light.
So why now?

3134
02:21:26,950 --> 02:21:28,480
Why did they say they shouldn't say 
that?

3135
02:21:28,990 --> 02:21:31,300
Saying that.
I know because they're lazy and bad.

3136
02:21:32,160 --> 02:21:34,390
Saying that these are like high level 
guys.

3137
02:21:34,391 --> 02:21:35,050
Yeah,
I know.

3138
02:21:35,650 --> 02:21:37,960
Okay.
So what is the never going to be invited

3139
02:21:37,961 --> 02:21:40,570
back to cosmology conference after this 
podcast?

3140
02:21:40,600 --> 02:21:45,600
Well,
you always have the infinite monkey 

3141
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:45,600
cage.
That'll,

3142
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:45,600
that'll be my new career.
Right.

3143
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:47,020
So what is happening then?

3144
02:21:47,960 --> 02:21:52,960
Well,
space is expanding and light is moving 

3145
02:21:52,960 --> 02:21:52,960
through it.
Right?

3146
02:21:52,960 --> 02:21:57,260
And what is certainly true is that the 
speed of light is a finite number,

3147
02:21:57,430 --> 02:21:58,120
right?
Right.

3148
02:21:58,370 --> 02:22:00,680
It's one light year per year.
The way to remember it.

3149
02:22:00,710 --> 02:22:03,290
Right?
So if the universe had a beginning,

3150
02:22:03,320 --> 02:22:08,320
a finite number of years ago,
then there's only so far out that light 

3151
02:22:08,320 --> 02:22:10,070
can get between now and then.
That's all there is.

3152
02:22:10,160 --> 02:22:15,160
So there are things far aWay that are so
far away we can never possibly see them 

3153
02:22:15,530 --> 02:22:20,530
at this current age of the universe 
because it would take longer than 14 

3154
02:22:20,530 --> 02:22:20,960
billion years for light to get from 
there to here.

3155
02:22:21,710 --> 02:22:24,590
And that's just because the universe has
a beginning.

3156
02:22:24,591 --> 02:22:26,130
It has nothing to do with the fact

3157
02:22:26,130 --> 02:22:28,500
that space is expanding at the speed or 
that speed.

3158
02:22:29,250 --> 02:22:30,330
Okay.
Um,

3159
02:22:30,540 --> 02:22:35,400
if there is a,
a point where the big bang begins,

3160
02:22:35,460 --> 02:22:40,460
right?
There is a single origin point and it 

3161
02:22:40,460 --> 02:22:43,620
explodes outward and we are seeing it 
from some position.

3162
02:22:43,890 --> 02:22:47,280
So we're seeing this explosion 14 
billion years ago.

3163
02:22:47,640 --> 02:22:50,660
Does it move in the opposite direction 
as well as their $28,

3164
02:22:50,661 --> 02:22:53,490
billion years and you know from point to
point.

3165
02:22:53,610 --> 02:22:54,870
Right.
So it's not like that.

3166
02:22:55,380 --> 02:22:57,120
The big thing is not a point.
Okay.

3167
02:22:57,150 --> 02:22:58,190
The big bang,
and this is,

3168
02:22:58,220 --> 02:23:02,130
this is hard to wrap your mind around.
The big bang is not a location in space,

3169
02:23:02,131 --> 02:23:07,131
it's a moment in time,
the time in the history of the universe 

3170
02:23:07,350 --> 02:23:09,210
when everything was on top of everything
else,

3171
02:23:09,640 --> 02:23:14,640
uh,
it's easier to talk about one 

3172
02:23:14,640 --> 02:23:17,960
microsecond after the big bang,
then the big bang one microsecond after 

3173
02:23:17,960 --> 02:23:17,960
the big bang.

3174
02:23:17,960 --> 02:23:19,350
The universe could very well have been 
infinitely large.

3175
02:23:19,740 --> 02:23:24,740
We don't know.
It's not like the universe started some 

3176
02:23:24,740 --> 02:23:24,740
micro second,
so any other time?

3177
02:23:24,740 --> 02:23:26,410
Infinitely small.
Well,

3178
02:23:26,500 --> 02:23:28,470
let's just forget about the infinitely 
small.

3179
02:23:28,510 --> 02:23:33,510
Okay.
Insanely small things were closer 

3180
02:23:33,510 --> 02:23:33,510
together.
There's no such thing as the size.

3181
02:23:33,510 --> 02:23:35,270
If the universe is infinitely big,
it's always infinitely big.

3182
02:23:35,470 --> 02:23:36,900
Okay.
But you can still the big bang.

3183
02:23:37,860 --> 02:23:38,880
Oh,
okay.

3184
02:23:39,030 --> 02:23:43,410
So if all matter is condensed into a 
very small spot,

3185
02:23:43,440 --> 02:23:47,550
it doesn't mean that all things around 
it are not infinitely large.

3186
02:23:48,060 --> 02:23:53,060
Well,
you don't want to say around it because 

3187
02:23:53,060 --> 02:23:54,530
we're talking about the entire universe.
So it visualize an infinitely big 

3188
02:23:55,111 --> 02:23:58,020
universe full of stuff.
Stuff,

3189
02:23:58,380 --> 02:23:59,370
stars,
galaxies.

3190
02:23:59,440 --> 02:24:00,510
Okay.
Like right now,

3191
02:24:00,720 --> 02:24:03,930
like right now,
and let's wind the clock backwards.

3192
02:24:04,080 --> 02:24:05,610
So suck it all in.
Yeah.

3193
02:24:06,030 --> 02:24:09,300
So the thing is that as far out as you 
look,

3194
02:24:09,420 --> 02:24:10,670
even if you look at,
you know,

3195
02:24:10,680 --> 02:24:12,810
with your god's eye view faster than the
speed of light,

3196
02:24:13,050 --> 02:24:14,340
there's still stuff out there.

3197
02:24:14,370 --> 02:24:16,650
It's uniformly spread,
let's say.

3198
02:24:16,710 --> 02:24:18,180
Okay.
So.

3199
02:24:18,210 --> 02:24:21,670
But it's closer together.
It's the relative size.

3200
02:24:21,750 --> 02:24:26,190
The relative distance between galaxies 
and stars is smaller in the past than it

3201
02:24:26,191 --> 02:24:31,191
is today.
But the whole size of the universe is 

3202
02:24:31,191 --> 02:24:33,060
still infinity and that's still true all
the way back.

3203
02:24:33,061 --> 02:24:35,550
Fourteen billion years,
right up to the big bang.

3204
02:24:35,580 --> 02:24:37,380
The universe could have been infinitely 
big,

3205
02:24:37,381 --> 02:24:42,381
but the density,
the amount of stuff in a cubic 

3206
02:24:42,381 --> 02:24:43,920
centimeter goes to infinity.
Whoa.

3207
02:24:43,980 --> 02:24:48,750
Yeah.
How big is the estimation that it was at

3208
02:24:48,751 --> 02:24:51,030
the moment of the big bang,
but before,

3209
02:24:51,031 --> 02:24:53,650
like before it expanded,
right?

3210
02:24:53,850 --> 02:24:57,450
It's thought to be fairly small but 
infinitely dense.

3211
02:24:57,510 --> 02:24:58,170
Right?
well,

3212
02:24:58,171 --> 02:25:01,770
I don't even think you can say it was 
thought to be in fairly small.

3213
02:25:02,010 --> 02:25:04,830
No,
the observable universe.

3214
02:25:04,860 --> 02:25:08,520
So I think this is,
this is maybe what gets lost because the

3215
02:25:08,521 --> 02:25:10,890
universe is finite in age.
We only see a part of it.

3216
02:25:11,130 --> 02:25:12,510
Okay.
When you see a part of it,

3217
02:25:12,511 --> 02:25:17,511
a few tens of billions of light years 
across called that the observable 

3218
02:25:17,511 --> 02:25:17,511
universe.
That's fine.

3219
02:25:17,511 --> 02:25:18,480
I didn't size.
Okay,

3220
02:25:18,720 --> 02:25:23,720
so that definitely was smaller and there
was an actual number you can attach to 

3221
02:25:23,720 --> 02:25:24,130
the question.

3222
02:25:24,130 --> 02:25:28,240
How big was it at the big bang and we 
don't know the answer.

3223
02:25:28,450 --> 02:25:31,960
We can sort of.
It depends on theoretical predictions.

3224
02:25:32,260 --> 02:25:34,600
It was the biggest possible size.
It could have been.

3225
02:25:34,601 --> 02:25:37,210
Was about a centimeter across the 
biggest possible.

3226
02:25:37,230 --> 02:25:38,710
Yeah.
As big as it could be.

3227
02:25:38,711 --> 02:25:41,110
So you're talking about essentially like
a pinky nail.

3228
02:25:41,140 --> 02:25:46,140
That's right.
That's as big as the whole universe 

3229
02:25:46,140 --> 02:25:46,140
could have been that.
That's right.

3230
02:25:46,140 --> 02:25:48,040
In fact in this,
so everything you see,

3231
02:25:48,041 --> 02:25:52,330
everything around you right now that you
can reach out and touch every galaxy out

3232
02:25:52,331 --> 02:25:57,331
there with billions of stars in them.
They were all condensed into this one 

3233
02:25:57,331 --> 02:25:59,440
centimeter cubic region of space.
What is the large,

3234
02:25:59,460 --> 02:26:01,240
and it couldn't be much smaller.
That's the largest.

3235
02:26:01,300 --> 02:26:02,470
It could.
That's the largest.

3236
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:04,090
Oh,
that's as big as it could have been.

3237
02:26:04,150 --> 02:26:05,550
It could have been much smaller.
It could have.

3238
02:26:05,560 --> 02:26:06,790
What is the smallest?
It could have been,

3239
02:26:07,440 --> 02:26:09,700
um,
will be called the plank size,

3240
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:14,200
a 10th of minus 35 or 10 to minus 40 
centimeters or something like that.

3241
02:26:14,260 --> 02:26:16,540
So incredibly tiny invisible.
Oh yeah.

3242
02:26:16,570 --> 02:26:17,470
Very,
very invisible.

3243
02:26:17,500 --> 02:26:19,480
Yeah.
Whoa.

3244
02:26:20,010 --> 02:26:22,030
Yeah.
Why do we think it happened?

3245
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:28,200
Well,
what is the reason why the evidence we 

3246
02:26:28,200 --> 02:26:28,200
have?
Yeah.

3247
02:26:28,200 --> 02:26:28,200
What,
what,

3248
02:26:28,200 --> 02:26:31,770
what is the current theory as to what,
what the big bang.

3249
02:26:31,771 --> 02:26:35,020
Like why did the big bang take place?
Well,

3250
02:26:35,021 --> 02:26:35,320
that's.
So,

3251
02:26:35,321 --> 02:26:40,321
that's a good question.
So there's no preferred conventional 

3252
02:26:40,321 --> 02:26:40,321
answer.
We just don't know that that's not,

3253
02:26:40,321 --> 02:26:44,851
that's not a,
we don't know because we're not sure 

3254
02:26:44,851 --> 02:26:44,851
that's a,
we have no idea is to answer.

3255
02:26:44,851 --> 02:26:48,910
Um,
obviously if there was a bounce or if 

3256
02:26:48,910 --> 02:26:50,890
there was some universe before ours,
out of which ours came,

3257
02:26:51,160 --> 02:26:52,720
there would be a sensible answer to 
that.

3258
02:26:52,721 --> 02:26:54,250
We just don't yet know what it is.

3259
02:26:54,640 --> 02:26:59,640
It's a more challenging question.
If you think that the big bang was truly

3260
02:27:00,101 --> 02:27:04,080
the beginning of the universe,
which is perfectly plausible,

3261
02:27:04,100 --> 02:27:09,100
it's perfectly compatible with the laws 
of physics and then you're in one of 

3262
02:27:09,100 --> 02:27:12,421
these situations,
you have to reorient the kinds of 

3263
02:27:12,421 --> 02:27:15,001
questions you will allow yourself to ask
because if the big bang was the 

3264
02:27:15,001 --> 02:27:18,361
beginning,
there's this intuitive feeling that 

3265
02:27:18,361 --> 02:27:21,271
there was time before the big bang when 
there wasn't anything and there was 

3266
02:27:21,271 --> 02:27:25,450
nothingness.
Nothing just sat around for a long time 

3267
02:27:25,450 --> 02:27:25,480
and then it decided to bang.
Okay.

3268
02:27:25,850 --> 02:27:28,720
Could've sat around for an infinite 
number of years,

3269
02:27:28,870 --> 02:27:29,650
right?
Yes,

3270
02:27:29,651 --> 02:27:34,651
but,
but don't think of it that way is what 

3271
02:27:34,651 --> 02:27:36,241
I'm trying to say.
Don't think about nothingness 

3272
02:27:36,241 --> 02:27:38,580
transforming into the big bank.
Think about our universe thing of it 

3273
02:27:38,580 --> 02:27:42,781
from the other side,
from the side that that we already 

3274
02:27:42,781 --> 02:27:43,390
exist,
but visualize into the past and imagined

3275
02:27:43,391 --> 02:27:46,360
that as you visualize into the past,
you hit a beginning.

3276
02:27:46,630 --> 02:27:51,630
You hit a first moment of time,
a time when time itself came into 

3277
02:27:51,630 --> 02:27:56,221
existence,
but there's no time out of which it 

3278
02:27:56,221 --> 02:27:56,221
came.
That's the beginning of time.

3279
02:27:56,580 --> 02:28:01,580
It's like walking north.
You hit the north pole once you're at 

3280
02:28:01,580 --> 02:28:02,530
the north pole,
you can't keep going north.

3281
02:28:02,920 --> 02:28:05,350
There's nothing weird.
It's just thAt everywhere,

3282
02:28:05,410 --> 02:28:08,600
every direction you go in,
we'd now be south at the big bang.

3283
02:28:08,890 --> 02:28:11,050
Time is only toward the future,
not toward the past.

3284
02:28:13,120 --> 02:28:16,070
That's all my mind blowing is that the 
era of time,

3285
02:28:16,810 --> 02:28:21,290
the arrow of time is the particular fact
that not only does time flow it,

3286
02:28:21,380 --> 02:28:26,380
the universe changes.
There are differences between the past 

3287
02:28:26,380 --> 02:28:26,380
and future.
God.

3288
02:28:26,380 --> 02:28:28,520
This time,
this is tough.

3289
02:28:29,390 --> 02:28:32,720
It's tough to.
How do you guys sleep?

3290
02:28:33,840 --> 02:28:36,320
Very well actually,
when I was a kid,

3291
02:28:36,350 --> 02:28:41,350
like it was 10 years older,
so when I first got interested in this 

3292
02:28:41,350 --> 02:28:41,690
stuff and uh,
so yeah,

3293
02:28:41,691 --> 02:28:46,691
when I was 11 or 12,
the thing that would stop me from 

3294
02:28:46,691 --> 02:28:48,280
sleeping was I be dreaming about,
you know,

3295
02:28:48,290 --> 02:28:53,290
the big bang in the universe.
Then I would come to the beginning and 

3296
02:28:53,290 --> 02:28:53,290
we go like,
but what if the universe had just chosen

3297
02:28:53,290 --> 02:28:55,850
not to exist?
I was no sleep for me.

3298
02:28:55,851 --> 02:28:56,010
That

3299
02:28:56,070 --> 02:28:58,060
oh,
choice,

3300
02:28:58,130 --> 02:28:59,730
right?
I know better now.

3301
02:28:59,740 --> 02:29:03,390
I moved on to other more worldly 
concerns keeping me awake at night.

3302
02:29:03,450 --> 02:29:08,450
So is there anybody working on any sort 
of theory to try to understand what 

3303
02:29:08,821 --> 02:29:13,560
forces might have caused it to burst 
forth?

3304
02:29:15,180 --> 02:29:16,950
Yes.
So I mean there's two answers to that.

3305
02:29:16,951 --> 02:29:18,630
One is yes,
I'm one of them.

3306
02:29:18,631 --> 02:29:20,880
There's plenty of people thinking about 
this kind of question,

3307
02:29:20,910 --> 02:29:22,830
but really,
I hate to say it,

3308
02:29:22,831 --> 02:29:25,980
but you shouldn't ask that question 
because again,

3309
02:29:26,100 --> 02:29:31,100
we're embedded in this world.
So the question you asked was what are 

3310
02:29:31,100 --> 02:29:33,000
the forces that caused it to burst 
forth?

3311
02:29:33,050 --> 02:29:38,050
Right?
So that presumes that there was a cause 

3312
02:29:38,050 --> 02:29:42,620
and that,
I mean causes and effects work 

3313
02:29:42,620 --> 02:29:45,711
themselves out over time.
So there was a time when there wasn't a 

3314
02:29:45,711 --> 02:29:48,840
big bang and then there was something 
that caused the big bang to occur.

3315
02:29:49,370 --> 02:29:54,370
So what I want to suggest is that that's
just not the metaphysical framework in 

3316
02:29:54,370 --> 02:29:55,500
which to think about the origin of the 
universe.

3317
02:29:55,770 --> 02:29:59,790
Don't ask what caused it,
asked what were the laws of physics that

3318
02:29:59,791 --> 02:30:04,791
can be compatible with both the universe
we see today and with the universe 

3319
02:30:04,791 --> 02:30:07,620
having a beginning 14 billion years ago.
We don't know the answer to that,

3320
02:30:07,621 --> 02:30:09,920
but that's the question we should ask.
It's,

3321
02:30:10,030 --> 02:30:10,660
it's,

3322
02:30:11,530 --> 02:30:14,290
it's such a complex discussion.
It's,

3323
02:30:14,500 --> 02:30:19,060
it's so complex that it's almost like 
infinite and its possibilities that you,

3324
02:30:19,061 --> 02:30:19,600
you,
you,

3325
02:30:19,660 --> 02:30:24,190
you go over all these variables,
these possibilities and what we know and

3326
02:30:24,191 --> 02:30:25,670
what we're learning and it's just,

3327
02:30:26,720 --> 02:30:27,410
well,
it's very,

3328
02:30:27,411 --> 02:30:30,020
it's complex,
but more importantly,

3329
02:30:30,110 --> 02:30:35,110
it's a realm that is just so far outside
our experience and our toolkit for 

3330
02:30:35,271 --> 02:30:37,970
dealing with the world that we have no 
guidance,

3331
02:30:37,971 --> 02:30:39,440
right?
We're kind of at sea,

3332
02:30:39,441 --> 02:30:42,290
like what are the kinds of things we 
should be asking about?

3333
02:30:42,320 --> 02:30:44,540
What are the answers that would satisfy 
us?

3334
02:30:44,541 --> 02:30:45,950
Right?
Um,

3335
02:30:45,951 --> 02:30:49,160
I would argue that there are brute 
facts.

3336
02:30:49,280 --> 02:30:54,280
There are things we just need to accept 
if we come up with a picture of the 

3337
02:30:54,280 --> 02:30:54,920
universe,
a set of laws of physics and a story for

3338
02:30:54,921 --> 02:30:56,420
the history of the universe that says,
well,

3339
02:30:56,421 --> 02:30:58,010
the universe started this way and then 
that happened,

3340
02:30:58,011 --> 02:30:59,510
et cetera,
and someone says,

3341
02:30:59,511 --> 02:31:01,490
well,
why did it happen that way?

3342
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,970
And I would say there is no answer to 
that question.

3343
02:31:04,971 --> 02:31:09,971
ThIs is just what it is.
I might change my mind if you convince 

3344
02:31:09,971 --> 02:31:13,211
me,
but there's no right to demand that 

3345
02:31:13,211 --> 02:31:13,880
there is a reason why things are one way
rather than another.

3346
02:31:14,600 --> 02:31:19,600
Do you have difficulty like thinking of

3347
02:31:20,370 --> 02:31:24,720
a potential reason that one day we will 
wrap our heads around?

3348
02:31:24,750 --> 02:31:28,080
Did he think that it's within the realm 
of our possibilities,

3349
02:31:28,120 --> 02:31:33,120
our understanding?
It's always possible that there is a 

3350
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:33,120
deeper explanation,
right?

3351
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:33,300
But then you want to say,
well,

3352
02:31:33,301 --> 02:31:34,960
okay,
why is that deeper explanation true?

3353
02:31:35,340 --> 02:31:38,370
And I think that this chain of 
explanations bottoms out,

3354
02:31:39,050 --> 02:31:41,120
I think that there will be one 
foundational appointed,

3355
02:31:41,220 --> 02:31:43,920
which is not sort of self explanatory,
but it's just.

3356
02:31:44,130 --> 02:31:45,390
And That's the way it is.

3357
02:31:47,830 --> 02:31:52,830
Are there any legitimate scientists that
are contemplating the possibility of a 

3358
02:31:52,830 --> 02:31:54,370
big bang not being the origin of the 
universe?

3359
02:31:54,640 --> 02:31:55,870
Oh yeah,
absolutely.

3360
02:31:56,620 --> 02:31:58,630
The big baNg could be just one of these 
moments.

3361
02:31:58,631 --> 02:32:03,631
One of these things that happens,
a one possIbility is that there's 

3362
02:32:03,631 --> 02:32:05,200
another universe that it sort of big and
quiet and empty,

3363
02:32:05,770 --> 02:32:08,230
but through a quantum mechanical 
fluctuation,

3364
02:32:08,260 --> 02:32:13,260
a little part of the universe could 
pinch off and become a separate baby 

3365
02:32:13,260 --> 02:32:17,821
universe and then grow by itself and 
that could be the origin of our 

3366
02:32:17,821 --> 02:32:19,160
universe.
So like a stellar nursery for universes.

3367
02:32:19,210 --> 02:32:23,070
Yeah,
and It could go on,

3368
02:32:23,160 --> 02:32:26,260
say the great thing to really.
So I haven't blown your mind yet,

3369
02:32:26,261 --> 02:32:27,280
but now I'm about to do it.
Oh,

3370
02:32:27,281 --> 02:32:29,590
you already did put it back together 
again real quick.

3371
02:32:29,620 --> 02:32:34,150
When you look at the universe,
the universe is finite in size.

3372
02:32:34,151 --> 02:32:39,151
You know,
we were talking about it could be 

3373
02:32:39,151 --> 02:32:39,151
infinitely big,
it could be finite insights,

3374
02:32:39,151 --> 02:32:41,820
but if it is finite in size,
we think that a finite universe has zero

3375
02:32:42,790 --> 02:32:45,820
total energy,
zero total charge,

3376
02:32:45,821 --> 02:32:48,130
zero total velocity,
etc.

3377
02:32:48,580 --> 02:32:53,290
so making a universe costs nothing.
Alan guth,

3378
02:32:53,291 --> 02:32:57,070
who's a famous cosmologist and mit says 
the universe is the ultimate free lunch.

3379
02:32:57,280 --> 02:33:00,310
Universes are not an expendable 
resource.

3380
02:33:01,090 --> 02:33:01,900
You can make.
if,

3381
02:33:01,960 --> 02:33:06,960
if you could make one universe,
you can make an infinite number of 

3382
02:33:06,960 --> 02:33:07,360
universes just as easily.
I don't understand that.

3383
02:33:07,650 --> 02:33:08,520
How,
how it.

3384
02:33:09,520 --> 02:33:12,460
Well,
so you understand there is.

3385
02:33:12,470 --> 02:33:13,570
Yeah.
Well there's bath,

3386
02:33:13,571 --> 02:33:14,560
right?
So look,

3387
02:33:14,561 --> 02:33:16,570
you look at the sun and you say,
look,

3388
02:33:16,571 --> 02:33:17,590
the sun,
that would.

3389
02:33:17,680 --> 02:33:21,070
That seems to be like it would be hard 
to make a lot of stuff there.

3390
02:33:21,071 --> 02:33:26,071
It can just appear,
but the son also has a gravitational 

3391
02:33:26,071 --> 02:33:26,071
field,
right?

3392
02:33:26,071 --> 02:33:30,630
There's gravity around the sun,
and what the math suggests is that there

3393
02:33:30,631 --> 02:33:35,631
is energy in the gravitational field of 
the sun which is negative and which is 

3394
02:33:37,211 --> 02:33:41,560
exactly equal to the energy of the sun 
and cancels it out so that if you've got

3395
02:33:41,561 --> 02:33:43,450
a universe with nothing in it,
but the sun,

3396
02:33:43,451 --> 02:33:46,930
that universe would have zero total 
energy if it were closed in on itself.

3397
02:33:47,640 --> 02:33:48,660
Wow.
Yeah.

3398
02:33:49,510 --> 02:33:52,000
It cancels itself out.
Yes.

3399
02:33:53,560 --> 02:33:57,370
So negative energy in gravity cancels 
the positive energy and stuff.

3400
02:33:57,850 --> 02:34:00,160
Therefore,
universes can have zero total energy.

3401
02:34:00,490 --> 02:34:05,490
And this is all obviously very 
hypothetical speculative mathematical 

3402
02:34:05,490 --> 02:34:05,490
stuff.
It's nothing we've done in the lab.

3403
02:34:05,490 --> 02:34:07,600
So take it with a grain of salt.
We could change our minds,

3404
02:34:07,601 --> 02:34:09,250
but that's the current state of the art.

3405
02:34:10,800 --> 02:34:11,640
wow.

3406
02:34:13,330 --> 02:34:17,440
So the entire universe you believe 
revolves around that principle.

3407
02:34:17,470 --> 02:34:18,010
Free lunch.

3408
02:34:18,010 --> 02:34:19,870
yeah,
you could easily.

3409
02:34:19,990 --> 02:34:22,840
So again,
if you could make a universe at all,

3410
02:34:23,710 --> 02:34:26,680
then you can probably make an infinite 
number of universes just as easily.

3411
02:34:27,480 --> 02:34:32,480
It's not like you have a 100 pounds of 
universe stuff and that gives you a 

3412
02:34:32,480 --> 02:34:32,480
finite number to me.

3413
02:34:32,680 --> 02:34:37,060
EverY universe costs you nothing to make
people have a hard time even thinking of

3414
02:34:37,150 --> 02:34:42,150
there being more than one universe.
And yoU start thinking about the fact 

3415
02:34:42,150 --> 02:34:43,830
that there's 100 million galaxies in 
this 100 million,

3416
02:34:44,800 --> 02:34:46,630
at least $100,
million solar systems.

3417
02:34:46,631 --> 02:34:51,631
Right?
And this galaxies is one of hundreds of 

3418
02:34:51,631 --> 02:34:52,300
billions of galaxies,
the known universe.

3419
02:34:52,810 --> 02:34:55,300
And that there might be more than one 
universe.

3420
02:34:55,360 --> 02:35:00,360
Right?
And the idea that this was all for our 

3421
02:35:00,360 --> 02:35:03,480
benefit seems a little ridiculous to 
very tiny compared to the size of the 

3422
02:35:03,480 --> 02:35:04,140
universe.
Yeah.

3423
02:35:04,150 --> 02:35:06,840
Well,
that does get to be a bit of an issue at

3424
02:35:06,880 --> 02:35:11,290
a certain point in time.
Just the massive at all is a defies.

3425
02:35:12,010 --> 02:35:15,000
It defies not just our understanding or 
our,

3426
02:35:15,750 --> 02:35:18,070
our,
like for the average person like myself,

3427
02:35:18,700 --> 02:35:23,700
it defies your ability to put the what,
what you're describing in the words,

3428
02:35:27,070 --> 02:35:29,550
right?
That's part of what the problem is.

3429
02:35:30,030 --> 02:35:30,360
Training.

3430
02:35:30,630 --> 02:35:31,840
Yeah.
As we keep pumping into.

3431
02:35:31,841 --> 02:35:34,350
But here I can restore your,
uh,

3432
02:35:34,420 --> 02:35:34,780
your,
uh,

3433
02:35:34,930 --> 02:35:37,060
your thought that we matter for the 
universe.

3434
02:35:37,080 --> 02:35:40,390
Bring it back pretty bad because we're 
wrapping this up in some sense.

3435
02:35:41,110 --> 02:35:46,110
Uh,
we are in the middle of the smallest 

3436
02:35:46,110 --> 02:35:49,090
scales in the important part of the 
universe versus the largest scales.

3437
02:35:49,091 --> 02:35:53,170
If you look at the universe on very,
very small scales or very,

3438
02:35:53,171 --> 02:35:56,440
very early times near the big bang,
the universe looks very simple.

3439
02:35:57,010 --> 02:35:58,720
Not a lot of complications.
Like We said,

3440
02:35:58,721 --> 02:36:00,790
you can't build a civilization on an 
electron.

3441
02:36:00,800 --> 02:36:04,780
It's just no possible intricacies there.
It's a very simple thing.

3442
02:36:05,380 --> 02:36:10,380
The universe is also very,
very simple and large scale and it will 

3443
02:36:10,380 --> 02:36:14,191
get only simpler in the future.
The university sort of dissolving into 

3444
02:36:14,191 --> 02:36:16,180
emptiness as the universe keeps 
expanding,

3445
02:36:16,840 --> 02:36:21,840
it's only in between on scales,
like the size of a human being or the 

3446
02:36:21,840 --> 02:36:23,740
earth and ecosphere that things are 
complex.

3447
02:36:24,250 --> 02:36:29,250
right?
So even though we're much smaller than 

3448
02:36:29,250 --> 02:36:29,250
the size of the universe,
we're very big compared to adam's.

3449
02:36:29,650 --> 02:36:34,650
The number of neurons in the human brain
is roughly the same as the number of 

3450
02:36:34,650 --> 02:36:38,281
stars in the galaxy,
so we are kind of a peak of 

3451
02:36:39,340 --> 02:36:42,640
structuredness of the universe of 
complexity.

3452
02:36:42,641 --> 02:36:46,030
I mean until we build even bigger 
artificial intelligences and sO forth,

3453
02:36:46,031 --> 02:36:48,640
but there's something that we are 
maximizing.

3454
02:36:49,060 --> 02:36:54,060
Something that is a is sort of 
concentrated on us which is not size or 

3455
02:36:55,241 --> 02:36:58,960
scale or time.
It is complication and complexity.

3456
02:37:01,590 --> 02:37:06,590
Wow.
Now in the same sense that the energy 

3457
02:37:06,590 --> 02:37:09,510
and the gravity of the stars sort of 
managed to cancel each other out.

3458
02:37:09,990 --> 02:37:11,430
Is that the case with people as well?

3459
02:37:12,040 --> 02:37:14,980
Well,
if this is all again math,

3460
02:37:15,590 --> 02:37:16,340
the whole universe

3461
02:37:16,340 --> 02:37:20,930
is a free lunch.
The claim would consider a universe

3462
02:37:21,350 --> 02:37:24,830
with nothing in it,
but you pick your favorite thing,

3463
02:37:24,920 --> 02:37:26,480
a person,
a star or a galaxy,

3464
02:37:26,481 --> 02:37:30,140
whatever.
Then the totaL energy in that thing,

3465
02:37:30,680 --> 02:37:33,020
minus the total energy in the 
gravitational field,

3466
02:37:33,021 --> 02:37:34,790
because that's negative would be exactly
zero.

3467
02:37:36,430 --> 02:37:36,970
Wow.

3468
02:37:38,320 --> 02:37:40,900
That is super hard to wrap your head 
around.

3469
02:37:40,930 --> 02:37:41,110
Yeah.

3470
02:37:42,780 --> 02:37:44,250
And then there's the big question,
right?

3471
02:37:44,280 --> 02:37:49,280
You wouldn't get paid the big bucks if 
it were using with the big question is 

3472
02:37:49,280 --> 02:37:52,741
why,
like why do you think this is all 

3473
02:37:52,741 --> 02:37:53,800
happening or do you ever use that word?
Why is,

3474
02:37:53,801 --> 02:37:55,030
why is a weird word,
right?

3475
02:37:55,031 --> 02:37:56,770
Yeah.
Why is it weird is happening?

3476
02:37:56,860 --> 02:37:59,650
It is.
So what's causing it to happen?

3477
02:37:59,830 --> 02:38:01,600
What are the forces that caused it to 
happen?

3478
02:38:01,840 --> 02:38:03,940
You ever.
Why do you ever look at all and go,

3479
02:38:04,240 --> 02:38:05,980
is there a purpose to all this?
So.

3480
02:38:06,070 --> 02:38:07,140
Sure.
Um,

3481
02:38:07,210 --> 02:38:09,100
and I think the answer is no.
I think that the,

3482
02:38:09,400 --> 02:38:10,270
I think that yeah,

3483
02:38:10,320 --> 02:38:12,810
there's no reason why.
And again,

3484
02:38:12,811 --> 02:38:15,800
just looking up into the sky,
uh,

3485
02:38:16,560 --> 02:38:21,560
you know,
unless the purpose was to make a pretty 

3486
02:38:21,560 --> 02:38:21,690
sky boy,
anything that we're seeing here on earth

3487
02:38:21,691 --> 02:38:25,500
could have been done much with much less
effort than making 100 billion galaxies.

3488
02:38:25,501 --> 02:38:27,130
Right?
Um,

3489
02:38:27,600 --> 02:38:32,600
there's no evidence in anything that 
we've learned about science or the 

3490
02:38:32,600 --> 02:38:34,560
universe that gives us a reason to 
believe that there's a purpose behind it

3491
02:38:34,561 --> 02:38:36,660
all.
If anything,

3492
02:38:36,661 --> 02:38:41,661
as time goes on,
the entropy of the universe is 

3493
02:38:41,661 --> 02:38:42,840
increasing and the universe is becoming 
more random and disorderly.

3494
02:38:43,560 --> 02:38:48,560
Um,
I think that we're riding a wave of a 

3495
02:38:48,560 --> 02:38:51,951
universe that is growing and expanding 
and cooling and becoming more and more 

3496
02:38:51,961 --> 02:38:54,420
disorderly,
and that's a finite amount of time.

3497
02:38:54,900 --> 02:38:58,020
So 14 billion years from the big bang to
today.

3498
02:38:58,021 --> 02:39:01,230
Sounds like a lot.
That's one point.

3499
02:39:01,231 --> 02:39:06,231
four times 10 to the 10 years,
but the future of the universe is 

3500
02:39:06,231 --> 02:39:09,060
enormously longer thAn that.
According to our best current theories.

3501
02:39:09,061 --> 02:39:09,900
It's,
it's way.

3502
02:39:09,901 --> 02:39:14,901
It's potentially infinitely long anyway.
The last star is not going to burn out 

3503
02:39:14,901 --> 02:39:19,041
until a quadrillion years from now.
We are very close to the beginning of 

3504
02:39:19,041 --> 02:39:22,620
the history of the universe and,
but it's not forever.

3505
02:39:22,650 --> 02:39:24,600
It doesn't last and infinite amount of 
time.

3506
02:39:24,630 --> 02:39:29,630
So the universe is a femoral.
We human beings and living creatures are

3507
02:39:29,641 --> 02:39:34,641
temporary structures within it.
And the idea that it's all for some big 

3508
02:39:34,641 --> 02:39:36,390
cosmic purpose,
it seems to hold very little water.

3509
02:39:36,870 --> 02:39:41,870
Do you ever contemplate what,
what function human beings have in the,

3510
02:39:42,941 --> 02:39:46,230
in the university,
the way we interface with reality,

3511
02:39:46,231 --> 02:39:50,070
the way we interface with our,
the nature around us?

3512
02:39:50,430 --> 02:39:51,120
Yeah.
I think that,

3513
02:39:51,121 --> 02:39:52,140
uh,
we don't have the function.

3514
02:39:52,141 --> 02:39:54,600
I don't think it's the right way to 
think about what human beings are.

3515
02:39:54,630 --> 02:39:57,090
We should be glad to be alive,
enjoy it while we're here,

3516
02:39:57,470 --> 02:40:02,470
uh,
be nice to each other and try to learn 

3517
02:40:02,470 --> 02:40:05,631
more about the universe.
But it's not if we choose not to do 

3518
02:40:05,631 --> 02:40:06,840
that,
that's not going against any preordained

3519
02:40:06,841 --> 02:40:08,030
function that we have.
Your,

3520
02:40:08,031 --> 02:40:10,890
you're a remarkably calm when you 
discuss these things.

3521
02:40:10,920 --> 02:40:13,110
like,
do you have any existential angst?

3522
02:40:13,140 --> 02:40:15,810
Do you have any,
like I think the other way around,

3523
02:40:15,811 --> 02:40:18,240
and honestly this is very,
very small amounts of data.

3524
02:40:18,300 --> 02:40:19,770
But,
uh,

3525
02:40:20,190 --> 02:40:25,190
from what I can tell when personal 
tragedies strike people who are 

3526
02:40:26,430 --> 02:40:31,430
atheistic cosmologists and scientists 
deal with it way better than people who 

3527
02:40:31,430 --> 02:40:35,211
think that we're embedded in a matrix 
with a bigger purpose or a spiritual 

3528
02:40:35,211 --> 02:40:35,211
reality.

3529
02:40:35,211 --> 02:40:35,490
Really.
Yeah,

3530
02:40:35,491 --> 02:40:40,491
because you get that this,
this happened and you have an infinite 

3531
02:40:40,491 --> 02:40:41,250
perspective,
like when someone dies,

3532
02:40:41,251 --> 02:40:42,900
it's sad.
You can be sad,

3533
02:40:43,290 --> 02:40:44,820
but you,
you can't say,

3534
02:40:44,821 --> 02:40:46,170
well,
it shouldn't have happened.

3535
02:40:46,570 --> 02:40:47,670
right?
This is.

3536
02:40:47,671 --> 02:40:48,930
These are the kinds of things that 
happen.

3537
02:40:49,410 --> 02:40:50,930
Damn dude,
it's gonna.

3538
02:40:50,950 --> 02:40:54,330
Take a while to process.
This is a long one.

3539
02:40:54,390 --> 02:40:55,770
Go out and look at the milky way.
I'm gonna.

3540
02:40:55,771 --> 02:40:59,100
Have to listen to this about 30 times 
and take notes,

3541
02:40:59,101 --> 02:41:00,930
but thank you very much and it was 
awesome.

3542
02:41:00,931 --> 02:41:02,970
I really appreciate it.
Thanks so much.

3543
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,250
If people want to get a hold of you or 
read some of your stuff,

3544
02:41:05,580 --> 02:41:10,580
what is the best way?
I have a website called preposterous 

3545
02:41:10,580 --> 02:41:13,581
universe.
What a great name and you know my last 

3546
02:41:13,581 --> 02:41:13,581
book,
the big picture,

3547
02:41:13,581 --> 02:41:14,970
talked about all these questions about 
purpose,

3548
02:41:14,971 --> 02:41:16,200
why we're here,
what we should do about it.

3549
02:41:16,201 --> 02:41:17,880
Is there an audio book available as it 
is?

3550
02:41:17,881 --> 02:41:19,770
I recorded it not far from here.
Excellent.

3551
02:41:19,890 --> 02:41:21,030
Beautiful.
Thank you so much,

3552
02:41:21,031 --> 02:41:21,870
man.
That was awesome.

3553
02:41:22,560 --> 02:41:23,190
Thanks everybody.
