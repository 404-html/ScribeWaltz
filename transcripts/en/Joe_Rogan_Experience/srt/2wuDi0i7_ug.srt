1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,970
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:03,161
Well,

3
00:00:03,161 --> 00:00:07,700
I think there's a beautiful thing about
being influenced by movies and books and

4
00:00:07,701 --> 00:00:11,450
songs in that they provide us with
entertainment and inspiration,

5
00:00:11,451 --> 00:00:16,451
but they also really distort the
shit out of realistic scenarios.

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,090
But I think you're supposed to be able
to distinguish between that though.

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:20,690
You know,

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,300
art is one thing in
reality as another art.

9
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:23,511
I just,

10
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:27,710
I think it's based on reality and then
we've got a couple wins is reality so

11
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:28,544
much.

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:28,931
Yeah.

13
00:00:28,931 --> 00:00:29,540
Yeah.

14
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,710
Especially with women.

15
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,470
How many women have these discs,

16
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:36,170
but especially young women that have
these distorted perceptions of Channing

17
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,003
Tatum movies.

18
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,370
Channing Tatum is,

19
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,520
that's how men behave and this is reality.

20
00:00:40,521 --> 00:00:41,480
It's going to happen to me.

21
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,950
I just gotta find my prints.

22
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,150
Yeah.

23
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,030
It's just not a bunch of
you want to come in you,

24
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,340
that's all it really is out there.

25
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,780
They're just lying.

26
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:51,710
And both sides.

27
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:51,910
The,

28
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,880
the aggressive male side and the men
who pretending they're not like all the

29
00:00:55,881 --> 00:00:56,930
other men cause they want to come.

30
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:57,351
And you too.

31
00:00:57,351 --> 00:01:00,440
And that's the only way they can go
about getting in there as being unique.

32
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:00,950
Yeah.

33
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:01,250
Or,

34
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,290
or just being like on your side,

35
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,370
men are shit,

36
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,761
right,

37
00:01:04,761 --> 00:01:05,031
right.

38
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:05,531
I'm hot.

39
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:06,920
I'm horrified to be a man.

40
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,123
Your Shit,

41
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,640
you see that on,

42
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,060
on Twitter and it's most archaic form,

43
00:01:14,061 --> 00:01:15,260
which is the White Knight.

44
00:01:15,261 --> 00:01:15,890
Yes.

45
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,440
I fucking love the White Knight.

46
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,110
I don't think I really verbally go,

47
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,430
oh yeah,

48
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,000
reading anything else but
white knights on Twitter.

49
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,430
When you bash somebody who's a girl,

50
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:28,640
uh,

51
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:28,980
and,

52
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,330
and,

53
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,141
and you know,

54
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:31,400
you call her out on something.

55
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,200
Uh,

56
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,800
and then some guys swoops in,

57
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,120
don't take that.

58
00:01:35,121 --> 00:01:36,200
You are beautiful.

59
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:37,940
You're a beautiful person and this,

60
00:01:37,941 --> 00:01:39,350
and he just like,

61
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:40,184
dude,

62
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:40,731
first of all,

63
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:42,110
you just want to fuck her.

64
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,880
You want to do the same thing.

65
00:01:43,881 --> 00:01:46,370
The guy that's fucking
bashing or but wants to do.

66
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,230
He's just taking a different angle,

67
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,220
you know,

68
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,070
and you swoop in and
what is their mindset?

69
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:52,970
Oh,

70
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,080
DM me,

71
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,670
you're a good man.

72
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,933
Does it stop it?

73
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,190
They just want love,

74
00:01:58,570 --> 00:01:59,403
love.

75
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,700
Love is not going to get their way.

76
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,570
They just want love.

77
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,540
It just doesn't have it.

78
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,320
I've given up on the concept of love.

79
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,290
I honestly don't think it really exists.

80
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,170
And this is something a lot
of people have called me on.

81
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:15,710
I think love is a cross between um,

82
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,980
lust and an obsession.

83
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,000
Kind of a,

84
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,410
not really obsession.

85
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:22,400
I think maybe um,

86
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,331
a,

87
00:02:23,331 --> 00:02:28,331
a fascination kind of just
this quick thing that happens.

88
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:29,660
It doesn't last long.

89
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,340
It could last maybe a couple,

90
00:02:31,341 --> 00:02:32,174
a few years,

91
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:33,643
quite a few years,

92
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,120
but it's still the same thing.

93
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,360
It's lust and this fascination with the
person and that conjures up this mixture

94
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:44,840
that seems like something that's love.

95
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,220
In the perfect scenario.

96
00:02:46,221 --> 00:02:47,930
You don't think that
people can be in love?

97
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,483
No.

98
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,740
I honestly don't see

99
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,500
two people.

100
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,650
I think honest love would be like,

101
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,160
you just never argue.

102
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,780
You agree with everything.

103
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,330
There's never a snooty snippy moment,

104
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,070
so it just doesn't exist.

105
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,680
And in time it,

106
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,980
it transmit,

107
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,020
it transfers into something more,

108
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:11,854
a habit,

109
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,450
a habitual thing.

110
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:13,740
The,

111
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,740
the lust turns into habit and the
fascination turns into comfort zone.

112
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,670
And then you're just together and you
continue to be together and you don't even

113
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,960
know about love anymore.

114
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,730
You're not coming home every day.

115
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,960
You're not at the office going,

116
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:29,681
fuck,

117
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:30,910
I want to be with her.

118
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,660
God,

119
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,590
when you first get together,

120
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:33,130
you're like,

121
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,150
I can't even work.

122
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:35,170
I love this girl.

123
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:36,190
I want to be with her.

124
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,950
I want fucking smeller Herrick,

125
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,190
kiss her and hug her,

126
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,250
and then you've got to leave and you
go into the store for 10 minutes,

127
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:42,791
Sweetie.

128
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:42,971
Oh,

129
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:44,520
I love you on one wall.

130
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,580
I wish I didn't have to go.

131
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:46,241
Come with me.

132
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:47,440
Come to the store.

133
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,210
It's just fucking crazy.

134
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,360
20 years of marriage and you're still
doing that bullshit and you still love the

135
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,210
person.

136
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:55,960
No,

137
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,350
you're now a habitual in
a habitual relationship.

138
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,740
I thought the sleep believed that he
is fucking pissed all over every place.

139
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,320
There's a bunch of people at work right
now listen to is going to fall in love.

140
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:13,891
Well,

141
00:04:13,891 --> 00:04:15,810
you definitely don't get the newness,

142
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,090
but you could still have
a great relationship.

143
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,081
But what is that?

144
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:19,740
It's not love,

145
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,630
but the falling in love park,

146
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,220
the falling of the newness.

147
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,461
Well,

148
00:04:23,461 --> 00:04:24,810
we know what the newness is.

149
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,950
The newness is a hormonal rush to make
babies and you're supposed to fuck the

150
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,520
time.

151
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:29,870
Yes.

152
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,001
Yeah.

153
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:31,560
That's why relationships,

154
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,180
most relationships.

155
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,340
Peter out around three months in,

156
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,500
that's when the woman
hits her first trimester.

157
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:39,810
She's already supposed to be pregnant
and you're supposed to be out of there.

158
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,391
Right.

159
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:41,190
Bang in a new one.

160
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:41,790
Why?

161
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,800
Because people were getting eaten
by Jaguars on a daily basis.

162
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,510
You had to fuck as many people as you
possibly could in order to ensure that

163
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,890
this the species survived.

164
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:50,160
Yeah.

165
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,730
The problem is our high mortality rate
when they then when human beings were in

166
00:04:53,731 --> 00:04:58,731
their infancy are high mortality rate
led to very specific types of behaviors

167
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:04,020
that are ingrained in our genetics and
those specific types of behaviors are

168
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:05,940
frowned upon by feminists now.

169
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,980
They the the the very thing that got
us to 2014 they trying to curve back.

170
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:11,670
Yeah.

171
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,460
This is like deceptive behavior
in order to try to get laid,

172
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,240
you know,

173
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,870
any type of sex other than the sex
that they feel comfortable with.

174
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,610
I'm happy that this happened.

175
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,100
If,

176
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,291
if,

177
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,970
if the man's have you had
fucked her I left leg.

178
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:24,883
Right.

179
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:25,230
You know,

180
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,860
it's anything that's not
along the lines of their,

181
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,311
their,

182
00:05:29,311 --> 00:05:30,810
their ideal is,

183
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,830
is a rape.

184
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:32,610
Yeah.

185
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:32,960
Yeah.

186
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,131
And,

187
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:33,901
and like you said,

188
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:38,901
it's just biological for the
preservation of humanity early on.

189
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,610
[inaudible] that's how we needed to add.

190
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,050
Here's where it gets more fascinating.

191
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,680
The women who are trying to tighten
this down as much as possible.

192
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,200
No one wants a fuck.

193
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,100
Yeah.

194
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:50,251
Yeah.

195
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:53,310
At the very top of the fucking machine,

196
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,470
the very top of the machine
is run by troll ladies.

197
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,501
Sure.

198
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:01,231
All ladies did.

199
00:06:01,231 --> 00:06:02,064
Y'all ladies,

200
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,280
they're not like really sexy,

201
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,860
attractive objects of desire.

202
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,250
Yeah.

203
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,083
You know,

204
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:08,711
I think when,

205
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:13,460
when they speak about like how like how
can a man dictate what happens to our

206
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:14,840
bodies kind of a thing.

207
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,530
It's the same thing as how can you
dictate what happens to a pretty girl?

208
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,040
Yeah.

209
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,330
Like you're not a pretty girl so you
don't understand what it's like to be that

210
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:27,680
and to be able to manipulate
men in such a fashion so you,

211
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:28,461
she should probably,

212
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:33,230
the troll ladies should probably steer
clear of what they think attractive men

213
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:34,064
and women should do.

214
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,860
It's really funny though to watch.

215
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:39,230
And I'm a lonely cat guy in my house,

216
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:39,471
Joe.

217
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:40,304
Right.

218
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,050
That's what it's come to.

219
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,130
A lonely cat guy.

220
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,570
You know,

221
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,120
I occasionally have some
bitches over though.

222
00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:47,954
You know,

223
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,910
you gotta I tell,

224
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:50,630
I mean,

225
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,161
like I said with,

226
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:51,801
with this whole,

227
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:51,981
uh,

228
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:53,330
I don't believe in love thing.

229
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,950
I've had to convey to two girls
that do come over the house,

230
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,610
um,

231
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,350
that I am not a boyfriend.

232
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,290
I'm not your boyfriend or
anything and it's so hard.

233
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,124
It's a hard thing.

234
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,053
You tell them.

235
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,740
So you are not your boyfriend.

236
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,270
I went through so many years,

237
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:09,020
Joe,

238
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,090
of being with girls much too long,

239
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,650
much longer than I should have.

240
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,783
Um,

241
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,080
a couple of weeks.

242
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,030
Yeah.

243
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:16,760
Yeah,

244
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:16,971
no,

245
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:19,550
I was one of those fucking years guys.

246
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:23,510
Like I've stayed in the marriage
that I hated for nine fucking years,

247
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,710
nine years.

248
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,490
And I think radio was part of it because
I had gotten into radio halfway through

249
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:29,180
the marriage.

250
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,140
So the second half,

251
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:31,670
I didn't even pay attention to it.

252
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,370
It was all about fucking radio.

253
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,550
I mean radio the straight,

254
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:34,970
I'm,

255
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,100
I'm going to build this
in a concentrate on that.

256
00:07:37,101 --> 00:07:41,750
So whatever burden she was was outweighed
by the pleasure of doing radio.

257
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:42,860
Uh,

258
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,730
but after nine years,

259
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:44,091
that was,

260
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:44,810
that was it.

261
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,350
So,

262
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:49,700
but I jumped right from that into another
relationship that just lasted years.

263
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,960
And then after that,

264
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:55,961
when I started thinking like maybe I
shouldn't be tell these girls like that,

265
00:07:56,031 --> 00:07:57,890
I feel for them so much,

266
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,263
you know,

267
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,800
and now I just say,

268
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:01,634
look,

269
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,140
understand what this is.

270
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,360
We are not boyfriend and girlfriend.

271
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,920
I am not in a relationship with you and,

272
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,560
and it,

273
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,393
it,

274
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,930
it almost works.

275
00:08:11,931 --> 00:08:12,740
I have done,

276
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,970
I have to fine tune it.

277
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,160
I'm almost there though.

278
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,190
So they don't get the message and it's um,

279
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,200
I start getting thing.

280
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,580
But then when I stuck getting texts,

281
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:23,270
I'd be like,

282
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,860
these are girlfriend texts.

283
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,990
We're not in a relationship.

284
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,100
Yes,

285
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,311
I go,

286
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:29,660
this is a girlfriend text.

287
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,340
Like what's an example of a girlfriend?

288
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,600
A girlfriend tax.

289
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,590
Uh,

290
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,540
you said I could do this.

291
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,410
And then at the last minute you
told me that I can't do it with you.

292
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,840
I can't go here or do this or something.

293
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,830
I'm like,

294
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,250
I changed my mind or I have something
else where I made other plans.

295
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,001
It happens.

296
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:47,990
It fell through.

297
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,371
Oh,

298
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:50,690
well you're treating me like shit.

299
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:51,320
This is,

300
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,960
hey,

301
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,460
no,

302
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,830
that's a girlfriend that isn't a friend.

303
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,730
If I call my friend Joe Curry,

304
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,570
let's say,

305
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,051
and I say,

306
00:08:58,051 --> 00:08:58,620
Joe,

307
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,510
this weekend I'm having
a party at the house,

308
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:01,290
come on over.

309
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:01,621
It'd be like,

310
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:02,310
okay,

311
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,940
and then on Friday afternoon
I call them and say,

312
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:06,480
Joe,

313
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,313
no party.

314
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,670
It's just not happening.

315
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:09,690
I'm doing something else.

316
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,231
All right,

317
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:11,064
cool.

318
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,650
That's like that.

319
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:15,300
Only if I could fuck Joe Curry.

320
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,100
See the girls and you're trying
to make that you're trying to,

321
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,310
I'm trying to make it
so they understand that,

322
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:28,311
that they are one of my friends that are
girls that if we want to have sex and

323
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:29,341
stuff,

324
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:30,150
that's great.

325
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,320
It's cool and everything,

326
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:36,650
but we can't have this relationship where
you live here and where where we are

327
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:43,071
obligated to go out for certain
occasions because your mic top bitch or

328
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:44,760
something or whatever it is.

329
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,500
What about them fucking other guys?

330
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,341
Yeah.

331
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:48,174
That doesn't happen.

332
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,580
No,

333
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,413
no,

334
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:51,290
no.

335
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,270
What were you an asshole?

336
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,510
Who's this guy?

337
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:54,800
No,

338
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,111
they,

339
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:55,650
they,

340
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:56,161
they could,

341
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:57,480
I don't want to hear about it.

342
00:09:57,481 --> 00:09:57,811
Just like,

343
00:09:57,811 --> 00:09:59,130
I don't want to have
to tell them about it.

344
00:09:59,280 --> 00:09:59,760
Oh,

345
00:09:59,760 --> 00:09:59,960
I,

346
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,020
I've heard this one like,

347
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,321
oh,

348
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:02,790
who are you going out with tonight?

349
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,380
This is none of your business.

350
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,970
It's none of your fucking business.

351
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:06,481
Oh,

352
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:07,440
is it this girl?

353
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,303
Is it that one?

354
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:08,620
Oh,

355
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:08,820
up.

356
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,541
I'm not telling you.

357
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,320
Why would I tell you?

358
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,190
Why wouldn't you?

359
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,090
Ah,

360
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:12,331
God,

361
00:10:12,331 --> 00:10:13,170
I don't want to hear this.

362
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,430
I just don't want to hear it.

363
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,181
But that's,

364
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:15,660
you know,

365
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,790
there's certain patterns of
relations in relationships to,

366
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,430
people automatically fall into
and they think they're allowed to.

367
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,540
Yes.

368
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,021
These are,

369
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:26,460
these are allowed because it's become
commonplace and that's what they've been

370
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:27,690
used to their whole life.

371
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:29,010
And that's what this,

372
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:34,011
this a groove that the guys have fallen
into over the years where they know

373
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:34,830
like,

374
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,550
oh my God,

375
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,110
you just realize at one point you go,

376
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,213
oh,

377
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,720
I'm in a relationship.

378
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,520
I didn't even want to be in one when we
were dating or something or just hanging

379
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:45,354
out,

380
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,120
like why does it always have
to turn into a relationship?

381
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,490
And I've said to girls before,

382
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:51,000
I've said,

383
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,260
relationships are the,

384
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:52,840
the,

385
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,170
the,

386
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:57,210
the death knell for a good companionship.

387
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,880
All of a sudden now there's obligations,

388
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,530
responsibilities,

389
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,060
accountabilities,

390
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:06,210
all these things that come
along with a relationship,

391
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:08,160
take away from the good
parts of hanging out,

392
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:09,630
which is we're watching TV,

393
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:10,171
we're drinking,

394
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:11,004
we're fucking,

395
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,120
we're going out to dinner.

396
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,420
We're not arguing about anything
because does that my phone?

397
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:15,661
Oh,

398
00:11:15,661 --> 00:11:16,494
I hope not.

399
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,420
Man.

400
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,430
How did you manage to avoid,

401
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,090
it's your girlfriend.

402
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,710
Like you avoided a,

403
00:11:26,711 --> 00:11:27,840
you avoided children.

404
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:28,621
You got no children.

405
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:29,454
Yes.

406
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:30,683
That's a big one.

407
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:35,870
That is the biggest because I
almost had a kid with my wife,

408
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:37,950
which would have just been,

409
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,480
I'd have had to kill myself.

410
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:41,880
I think I would still have to
do something to get out of it.

411
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,810
Um,

412
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:43,100
Eh,

413
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:43,410
Eh,

414
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:43,980
yeah.

415
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,370
Yeah.

416
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:44,941
She went,

417
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:45,751
she got first,

418
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:47,760
she got one of those ectopic pregnancies,

419
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:52,170
which happens in the Fallopian tube and
blows up and she like started bleeding

420
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:54,070
internally and a boy,

421
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,910
if I had a future me came back at the
moment I was driving into the hospital,

422
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,650
I may have made a stop at Mcdonald's

423
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,230
or you know,

424
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,810
I might've had to pick a few things
up while she was in the passenger seat

425
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,673
bleeding to death.

426
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,690
Oh my goodness.

427
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,340
Oh,

428
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,570
well you say this because she,

429
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,733
she basically,

430
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:12,431
I mean,

431
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,440
how much money you should
take over the years.

432
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,610
It was a bad divorce.

433
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,620
It's seven figures she took and
her long period of time too,

434
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:19,871
right?

435
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:20,080
Yeah.

436
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,060
She got Dominic Barbara for her lawyer,

437
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:22,961
you know,

438
00:12:22,961 --> 00:12:24,790
famed bloated and Howard stern attorney.

439
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:29,791
But Dominic Barbara was her lawyer and
he was just so much fucking anger that I

440
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:31,900
had.

441
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,400
You think I'm angry now people.

442
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,263
Wow.

443
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:34,960
Oh,

444
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,793
was I angry?

445
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,993
Um,

446
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:37,991
and yeah,

447
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:38,321
I,

448
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:40,180
I hated them.

449
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,650
I hated that whole camp.

450
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,910
The lawyers,

451
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,680
they'd come in and I,

452
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,360
I had to pay her legal bills,

453
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,240
which is another one of those great
fucking amazing feminist things.

454
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,970
I had to pay your legal bills and mine.

455
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,680
So she hires Dominic Barbara and he's
just this fucking way expensive attorney.

456
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,461
And I think,

457
00:12:57,461 --> 00:12:57,641
well,

458
00:12:57,641 --> 00:12:58,630
I got to save some money,

459
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:00,310
so let me hire a cheaper attorney.

460
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,061
Oh,

461
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:01,871
that doesn't work,

462
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:02,704
Joe.

463
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,310
That's ridiculous.

464
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,500
The guy that would come in with like a
Manila folder into court and they were,

465
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,370
they had hand trucks of,

466
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:14,050
of those big boxes,

467
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:14,781
uh,

468
00:13:14,781 --> 00:13:17,550
of legal briefs and stuff on their side.

469
00:13:17,551 --> 00:13:18,384
And I'm just,

470
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,420
it's just like,

471
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:19,571
oh,

472
00:13:19,571 --> 00:13:21,370
this is the worst thing ever.

473
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,480
And uh,

474
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:22,651
we,

475
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:22,870
yeah,

476
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,530
over the course of quite a few years I
had to keep paying her and paying her and

477
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:28,720
then it was over and I'm
very happy with that.

478
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,040
Do you ever communicate with her now?

479
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:30,880
No.

480
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,480
Thank God.

481
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,201
And I don't have to.

482
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:33,610
And if I had kids I would have to,

483
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,890
I don't understand how that happens.

484
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,660
I like a lot of people say,

485
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:37,991
well,

486
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:38,261
no,

487
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:39,040
you know,

488
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,810
over the years we've built
up a nice relationship.

489
00:13:40,811 --> 00:13:40,951
I'm,

490
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:42,190
I'm friends with my ex wife was like,

491
00:13:42,191 --> 00:13:42,281
no,

492
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:42,910
you're not.

493
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,910
You had to develop something or you
would have killed her or yourself or

494
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,293
everyone involved.

495
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,230
You have a kid,

496
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,130
so you have to kind of build some
type of relationship with her.

497
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,540
I have a buddy who's friends with his ex
girlfriend and his ex girlfriend is now

498
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:01,930
married to another one of his friends
and they have kids together and they get

499
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,280
all their kids together and play.

500
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,233
That's weird.

501
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,620
That's just odd.

502
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,990
I don't think it ever goes away.

503
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:09,820
I don't think that you fucked her.

504
00:14:09,821 --> 00:14:10,690
Ever goes away.

505
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:11,560
No,

506
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,393
probably not.

507
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,341
Probably not.

508
00:14:13,341 --> 00:14:14,130
The uh,

509
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,780
the ex boyfriend and the new husband,

510
00:14:16,781 --> 00:14:20,530
they do have a little weird thing with
each other with the new husband will

511
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:25,060
occasionally criticized the ex boyfriend
and a little bit of an over excessive

512
00:14:25,061 --> 00:14:25,630
way.

513
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,290
Wow.

514
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:30,450
Cause he knows that I'm going to
keep this thing going on in the Dick

515
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,180
pretends to be cool with it.

516
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:38,890
But we know there's a lot of
weirdness to it all weirdness.

517
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,873
Oh,

518
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,790
but you got note hand.

519
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,090
Oh,

520
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:43,571
that's true.

521
00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:43,771
Yeah.

522
00:14:43,771 --> 00:14:43,991
Yeah.

523
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:44,411
Dominic,

524
00:14:44,411 --> 00:14:44,800
Barbara,

525
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,990
the lawyer for my wife,

526
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,050
uh,

527
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,700
he came to my house

528
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,083
a couple of months ago.

529
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,670
For what knocked on the door,

530
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,700
came to the house because he heard that
I got fired from Sirius Xm and he was

531
00:14:58,281 --> 00:14:58,640
like,

532
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,380
I just got out of rehab,

533
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,750
drugs and alcohol ruined my life.

534
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:04,430
I don't longer have a law practice.

535
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm,

536
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,360
you know,

537
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:05,690
I,

538
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:10,100
he got arrested for stealing from one
of the stores of the Miracle Mile there

539
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:11,870
and a lot on long island.

540
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,530
And,

541
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,363
um,

542
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,660
and he's just,

543
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,920
he's destitute now.

544
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,240
He was living on his friend's couch.

545
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:21,650
He went from that attorney that was always
on Howard's show and made millions of

546
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:21,651
dollars,

547
00:15:21,651 --> 00:15:23,450
obviously made some off of me.

548
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,200
Uh,

549
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,730
and then he's just destitute now.

550
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,710
So I read the stories in the paper before
I got fired and everything and ended.

551
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,560
I'll always laughed.

552
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:30,921
I thought,

553
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:31,490
good,

554
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,061
good for him,

555
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:33,200
Karma motherfucker.

556
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,393
Um,

557
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:35,031
but,

558
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:35,481
and if you,

559
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:36,770
if you crow about Karma,

560
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:37,461
isn't that bad?

561
00:15:37,461 --> 00:15:38,290
Karmically,

562
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:38,691
thanks.

563
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:39,501
I think it is too.

564
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:40,060
So,

565
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:40,370
Eh,

566
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,170
whatever.

567
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,003
Um,

568
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,371
but,

569
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:43,890
uh,

570
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:44,270
he,

571
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:44,660
he,

572
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,600
he knocked on my door and
I'm looking out the window.

573
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:46,821
I like,

574
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,050
I think that's fucking Dominic Barbara.

575
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,810
And he comes in and he was
trying to preach to me,

576
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:51,830
like he's saying,

577
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:52,410
uh,

578
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:52,630
uh,

579
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,980
I read what happened and
I'm thinking maybe you know,

580
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:56,540
you need help or something,

581
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,100
or he wants to be your sponsor.

582
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,980
Fuck what I'm talking about.

583
00:16:00,981 --> 00:16:04,310
Probably a sees you as an opportunity
to get back into the limelight.

584
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:08,540
And B feels bad that he's
still your fucking money maybe.

585
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,460
And he might've been doing one of those,

586
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,323
uh,

587
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:15,980
12 step things where he's got to make
some kind of reconcile affiliation with

588
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:16,540
me.

589
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:16,821
Uh,

590
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:17,654
so he came over,

591
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,171
he did that,

592
00:16:18,171 --> 00:16:19,640
but then at the end he sees like,

593
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:20,840
so you got the new show,

594
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:21,920
you're going to be starting up.

595
00:16:21,921 --> 00:16:22,131
I'm like,

596
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:22,281
yeah.

597
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:22,790
He goes,

598
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,211
you know,

599
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:23,451
I,

600
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:23,690
uh,

601
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:23,901
no,

602
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:25,910
this advertising thing where this,

603
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:29,210
and then he's pitching some type
of advertising for the show.

604
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:30,380
So yeah.

605
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,491
So he,

606
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,324
uh,

607
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,530
he left his number let,

608
00:16:33,531 --> 00:16:36,050
and then people are stole money
from me fucking out of here.

609
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,221
And people were saying that.

610
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:37,491
They're like,

611
00:16:37,491 --> 00:16:39,950
why did you even let them in your house?

612
00:16:39,951 --> 00:16:40,131
Why?

613
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:40,964
You know,

614
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,460
and they're saying you should have shot
him when he got in the house and say

615
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,870
that he just tried to attack you.

616
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,700
He's crazy.

617
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,060
He was on drugs.

618
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,310
He stole money.

619
00:16:49,311 --> 00:16:52,340
He's look at his fucking record man.

620
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,560
And,

621
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,530
and check this knife out here.

622
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,180
Yes it matches my cutlery set,

623
00:16:59,181 --> 00:17:02,480
but it's not very well very popular item.

624
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,690
That was always the,

625
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:09,340
the intense fear of the
thought that reincarnation
might be true and even though

626
00:17:09,531 --> 00:17:13,540
no one really remembers who they were
in a previous life or who they are going

627
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,110
to be in the next or something,

628
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:15,980
you always like,

629
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,300
I don't want a man.

630
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:19,250
I got a good one this time around.

631
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,740
I got so fucking lucky.

632
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:25,070
New York United States wide scale job.

633
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:26,810
This fucking is,

634
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:30,010
I aced this and then you get reincarnated.

635
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,860
You're like fucking,

636
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:31,790
you got Ebola,

637
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:34,400
you're coughing your blood
up in front of a fucking guy.

638
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:37,100
Fucking a goat or you're a monkey or,

639
00:17:37,101 --> 00:17:37,581
and you know,

640
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:39,530
you used to be a person but you can't talk

641
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,620
and that's all you're getting

642
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,680
bummed out.

643
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,540
That would be a bummer.

644
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,231
Beaten off,

645
00:17:48,231 --> 00:17:49,050
bummed out,

646
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:49,960
knowing you have

647
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,920
to be 10 I was fucking,

648
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:53,910
I was in New York.

649
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,510
I was,

650
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,670
it was a white guy.

651
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,710
I was a white guy who had this whole
thing where I was telling chicks,

652
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,090
no girlfriend,

653
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:00,901
girlfriends.

654
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:02,760
It was crazy and they still came over.

655
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,530
It's crazy.

656
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,280
How many of you may think come over
because they think I'm going to fix him.

657
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,250
This guy with his no girl shit.

658
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,143
I think so.

659
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,430
I think there have been
a few that think like,

660
00:18:14,431 --> 00:18:17,490
oh well he just hasn't found
the right girl and they had,

661
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,800
they'll say they go with
it in the beginning,

662
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:21,690
but then they start
getting angry with you.

663
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,171
Yeah.

664
00:18:22,171 --> 00:18:23,400
Is it as they realize,

665
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,620
oh this mother fucker's serious sin.

666
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,550
Oh wait a minute.

667
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,050
He meant that bullshit.

668
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,900
You guys say yes,

669
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,230
but they can't pull it off.

670
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,600
No one really means that when they say it,

671
00:18:33,601 --> 00:18:33,811
fuck.

672
00:18:33,811 --> 00:18:36,090
Do you think you are that
you could pull this off.

673
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,100
They get that.

674
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,260
Oh yeah.

675
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:39,601
Fuck.

676
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:40,530
Do you think you are?

677
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,930
But do you think you are who the WHO.

678
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:43,800
It's a fuck you.

679
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:44,880
You fucking idiot.

680
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,830
Exactly why they already fucked you.

681
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:47,903
Ah,

682
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:48,810
rape.

683
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:49,643
Wait a minute,

684
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,620
take a I take it back then away.

685
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,020
Consent that they can draw a troll.

686
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:56,170
Women have spoken

687
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,630
the fucking cliff for the horn.

688
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,810
We found another one.

689
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,493
Uh,

690
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,200
you having fun?

691
00:19:07,201 --> 00:19:09,180
What do you live in your
life by your own rules?

692
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:09,570
I said,

693
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,920
it's fuck you if they don't.

694
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,790
People don't like that.

695
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:12,180
I guess.
