1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,450
Top of the morning to your fuck face.

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,483
Hi everybody.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,740
It's early for her very early frost.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,330
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience
is brought to you by stamps.com if you

5
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:17,730
have not heard postage
rates have changed yet.

6
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:18,840
Again Ladies and gentlemen,

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,200
which by the way don't complain about
that because if you had a fucking take

8
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:24,630
that it's postal service
is a great service.

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,710
If you had to actually take your shit and
move it across the country and give it

10
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:29,400
to somebody else,

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,940
it would be worth so much more than you
actually have to pay in postage but and

12
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:34,050
even easier,

13
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:39,051
more convenient way to handle everything
is stamps.com with stamps.com you will

14
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,690
eliminate those time consuming
trips to the post office.

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,820
Everything you do at the post office
you can do from your desk at home,

16
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,030
buy and print official US postage for
any letter or package using your own

17
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:57,840
computer or printer and printed
brother and stamps.com always updates,

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,330
updates the postage rates
for you automatically,

19
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,220
so you will always get the exact postage
that you need the instant you need it.

20
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,190
You never have to go to
the post office again.

21
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,440
How Gloria says that I say quite,

22
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,480
quite glorious and I want
to use quite that often.

23
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:13,710
Um,

24
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:18,220
if you enter in the code word J r e on
stamps.com there's a little old school in

25
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,751
microphone.

26
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:19,770
In the upper right hand corner,

27
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,660
you will get a no risk trial.

28
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:24,270
That includes a $110 bonus offer,

29
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,260
a digital scale and up
to $55 or free postage.

30
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,150
So don't wait.

31
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,300
Go to stamps.com before
you do anything else,

32
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:38,301
click
on the
microphone@thetopofthehomepageandtypeinjrethatstamps.com
and
enter

33
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:44,190
j r e were also brought to you by ting.

34
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,580
Ting is a no bullshit mobile service
that uses the sprint backbone.

35
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,550
They make it so that all the stuff that
you normally have to deal with when

36
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:58,290
you're dealing with large providers
is eliminated early termination fees,

37
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,891
eliminated,

38
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:00,060
contracts eliminated.

39
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:05,140
They just want to sell you good cell phone
coverage at a reasonable rate and 98%

40
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:09,720
of people would save money with Tang.

41
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,860
That's a bold statement,

42
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,390
but it's not my statement,

43
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,740
it's Dang statement.

44
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,970
So if it turns out to be bullshit,

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,833
don't come back to me.

46
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,940
But what I do know is that I have friends,

47
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:18,751
like a doctor,

48
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:21,210
Chris Ryan who switched over to tig.

49
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,500
Fucking loves it.

50
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,720
A Red Band switched over to ting,

51
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,583
loves it.

52
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,610
Excellent service and much cheaper
than what they were getting before.

53
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:30,630
Um,

54
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,160
the waiting is set up.

55
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,180
You can buy high end android phones.

56
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,260
Like they,

57
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:38,310
the ones that they sell,

58
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:43,311
they sell the top end phones like
the HTC one or the galaxy note three,

59
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:45,180
which is what I have.

60
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,510
They sell the um,

61
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,340
all,

62
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,380
all the like the really cool and groovy.

63
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,570
Okay.

64
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,410
Android phones,

65
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:52,783
excuse me.

66
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,420
Like the,

67
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,500
I guess the mega black,

68
00:02:54,501 --> 00:02:58,490
if you're like so fucking crazy that a
six inch phone is not big enough for you,

69
00:02:58,730 --> 00:02:59,680
you need a bigger home,

70
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,390
take it down a notch son.

71
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,380
That's just going to go away.

72
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:02,621
You know,

73
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:03,041
that's like,

74
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,540
that's like spinners on wheels.

75
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,860
It's not going to last.

76
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,000
It's a fad.

77
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,590
It's a fad kid.

78
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:09,550
Uh,

79
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,750
but ting,

80
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,510
the way they have it set up is a,

81
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,980
you can even bring over phones,

82
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,360
some of the phones from sprint.

83
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,183
Um,

84
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,140
if you have,

85
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:19,900
uh,

86
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,500
uh,

87
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,030
like one of the android phones,

88
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:27,031
HTC one LG g two a million of these
fucking things at this point in time.

89
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:32,590
There were these to be a large gap
between the iPhone and the android phones,

90
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:37,591
but that gap has been crossed and what
they have now is just a bunch of really

91
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:38,470
cool phones.

92
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:38,861
And,

93
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:39,694
uh,

94
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,610
all the bullshit that you would
normally have to deal with is a,

95
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:43,750
is out the window with Tang.

96
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,051
So we're,

97
00:03:45,051 --> 00:03:46,360
we're happy to things a sponsor.

98
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:49,690
We're happy that people that have
used Ting and a contacted us,

99
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:50,870
excuse me,

100
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,450
have had nothing but
positive things to say.

101
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,613
Everybody

102
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,280
delicious coffee to try
to warm my brain up.

103
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,230
Everybody that's used it,

104
00:03:59,290 --> 00:03:59,590
uh,

105
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,120
has had nothing but
positive things to say.

106
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,540
So the website is rogan.ting.com.

107
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,720
Go there and you'll save 25 bucks off of
any new cell phone that they have there

108
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,693
at tig.

109
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,653
We love it.

110
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,793
We're big fans.

111
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,330
Go there and enjoy.

112
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,370
We're also brought to you by on it.

113
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,061
That's o.

114
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:19,331
N,

115
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:19,660
n.

116
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,230
I.

117
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:20,980
T.

118
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,130
If you haven't been to on it for a while
then you probably missed the launch of

119
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,420
our Zombie Bells.

120
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,700
If you are preparing for
the Zombie apocalypse,

121
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,220
there's no better way to get in
shaped in a fucking kettle bell.

122
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,390
It looks like a Zombie's head cause
it's scary and it's motivating and it's

123
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:34,690
acid.

124
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,200
Actually Three d balanced to
give you a proper workout.

125
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,120
Just like a real kettle bell.

126
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,100
It is a real kettle bell
and it will last forever.

127
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:42,311
I mean,

128
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:45,130
these things are fucking solid metal.

129
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,430
The 72 won the 54,

130
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,330
the 36 and the uh,

131
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,220
the 18 pounds,

132
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,800
all these different kettle bells,

133
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,350
um,

134
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,030
they're not just beautiful to look at.

135
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,650
They're actually fully functional.

136
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:01,710
The only thing you have to make sure is
that you have the face facing towards

137
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:04,630
you when you do like cleans
and things along those lines.

138
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:04,961
So the,

139
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:06,070
the back of the Kettle Bell,

140
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:07,090
which is nice and smooth,

141
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:08,890
it's what slaps into your forum.

142
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,500
You don't want that knows
to go digging into your arm.

143
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,430
But it's simple.

144
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,263
It's easy to use.

145
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:13,870
Uh,

146
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:17,680
if you are interested in getting in
shape and starting to do a strength and

147
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:18,520
conditioning workout,

148
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,563
I beg of you.

149
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,360
If you can please go
to a personal trainer,

150
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,770
someone who knows what they're doing
and just learn the basic fundamentals of

151
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:27,604
the movements.

152
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,700
And when you're learning and when
you're doing it and practicing it,

153
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,650
do it with a lightweight.

154
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,750
I know you want to be a manly man.

155
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,190
I know you want to show everybody.

156
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:38,950
How would yo dude do focus 72 pounds?

157
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:39,821
Don't do that.

158
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:40,900
You're going to fucking hurt yourself.

159
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,670
Started out with lightweights
and one of the websites that a,

160
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,150
when the videos that we support on
the website is the Keith Webber,

161
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,610
extreme kettlebell cardio workout.

162
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,380
And I've told many a person,

163
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,440
I work out with 35 pounds with
this and I am in fact a manly man,

164
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,810
but that's all you need is 35 pounds.

165
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:02,090
This what this workout will kick your ass.

166
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,360
Crank it up to 45 pounds
and you'll be a dead man.

167
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,321
That's right.

168
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:07,100
I said it.

169
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,290
Keith Weber is a stud
and he does it 45 pounds.

170
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,550
But he's more studly than me.

171
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,030
All right?

172
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,710
That's something I'm
dealing with with my life.

173
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,100
But what you need to deal with with
your life is get your shit together,

174
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:16,670
son.

175
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,630
Get yourself in shape,

176
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,800
feel better,

177
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:19,640
be happier.

178
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:23,870
And one of the best ways to do that
folks is get your body move in.

179
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,040
If you don't have the money to buy a
kettle bells and fucking workout DVDs,

180
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,130
goddammit,

181
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:33,500
go online and watch some
videos on bodyweight movements.

182
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,300
Just bodyweight exercises,

183
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:36,320
body weight squats,

184
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,300
sit ups,

185
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,000
pushups,

186
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,380
do something you lazy.

187
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:39,980
Fuck.

188
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,930
Get your life in order.

189
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,380
A big factor in getting your life
in order is pumping the blood,

190
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,730
getting everything moving,

191
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,520
giving yourself a feeling
of accomplishment every day.

192
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:52,490
Wake up and do a little
work out just a little.

193
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,330
Give her some 10,

194
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:54,290
15 minutes,

195
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,130
something.

196
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,110
Drink water instead of soda.

197
00:06:57,111 --> 00:06:58,490
You fucking freak.

198
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,510
Come on,

199
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,810

would love to help you at on it.

200
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,710

10% off any and all supplements.

00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:11,150

205
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,000
Kara Santa Maria is here.

206
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,230
We're going to talk some shit about,

207
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:17,360
some people want to drop some knowledge.

208
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,920
She's going to science us.

209
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,090
She's going to educate us.

210
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,140
Who are we talking shit about?

211
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,680
I don't know.

212
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,340
Okay.

213
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,560
I'm sure you'll find somebody.

214
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,180
Boom.

215
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,030
Create the music.

216
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,910
The Joe Rogan experience.

217
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,900
Try by day Joe Rogan podcast by night.

218
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:37,370
Well,

219
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,430
the last time you were here
you coined a phrase or you,

220
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:42,320
you used a phrase that I have stolen

221
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,000
and abused over and over and over again.

222
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,283
I give you credit,

223
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,280
but it's Wu peddler.

224
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,160
Oh Yeah,

225
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,210
love that box show pro.

226
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:48,690
Yeah.

227
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:49,523
Yeah,

228
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:49,791
yeah.

229
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:50,900
I typically didn't coin that,

230
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:51,350
but I,

231
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,951
I love it too.

232
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:53,720
I use a lot every time I see that dude,

233
00:07:53,721 --> 00:07:54,800
I just think Wu peddler.

234
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,140
Yeah.

235
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:59,170
We have a little kind of Twitter
thing with him that yeah,

236
00:07:59,171 --> 00:07:59,510
it was,

237
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,140
I was calling him,

238
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,730
I asked him if he whooped pedaled much.

239
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,121
Yeah.

240
00:08:02,121 --> 00:08:02,510
And then,

241
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,560
and then it was something about,

242
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:04,071
he was saying like,

243
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:05,510
I am a god and you were like Woo,

244
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:05,931
pedal much.

245
00:08:05,931 --> 00:08:06,800
And he was like,

246
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,251
oh,

247
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:08,031
it was really funny.

248
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:08,930
I favorite at it.

249
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:09,441
But yeah,

250
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:10,280
he was actually like,

251
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:10,521
he was,

252
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:11,990
he had a good sense of humor about it.

253
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,480
I don't think he takes
himself totally seriously.

254
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:14,720
Yeah.

255
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,190
He's not like cult leader.

256
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:16,891
Seriously.

257
00:08:16,891 --> 00:08:17,180
Yeah.

258
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,013
I think he gets a,

259
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,800
he gets a hell ahead of himself and
he said some really ridiculous shit.

260
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,300
And then when people call him on it,

261
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:23,570
you know,

262
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,220
he just starts using the word quantum.

263
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,193
Yeah.

264
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,400
There was that shit in there with a bunch.

265
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,930
Quantum consciousness is room.

266
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:31,983
Mm hmm.

267
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:33,710
You know,

268
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:38,330
I think better him than a lot of other
people in his position better him.

269
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:42,770
Then you know that Kevin
Trudeau guy that's selling
you weight loss secrets that

270
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:44,500
they don't want you to
know about [inaudible].

271
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,500
It doesn't seem like depot,

272
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:47,060
I mean is trying to sell his books.

273
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:47,960
But outside of that,

274
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:50,150
I don't really feel
like he is that much of,

275
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:50,661
you know,

276
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:51,590
like a predator.

277
00:08:51,591 --> 00:08:54,630
Like he's not using this
kind of pseudoscience and,

278
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,080
and truth be told there is a little bit
of truth to some of the things that he

279
00:08:58,081 --> 00:08:58,561
talks about,

280
00:08:58,561 --> 00:08:58,771
but,

281
00:08:58,771 --> 00:08:59,670
but he does kind of,

282
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,080
I think step way outside of the boundaries
of what's reasonable and healthy.

283
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:04,831
But you're right,

284
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:08,550
I don't think he's actually trying to
take advantage of people fundamentally.

285
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:12,720
I think that Deepak Chopra
thinks what he's talking about.

286
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:15,630
I mean he believes in what he's talking
about and I think that he actually

287
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:17,970
thinks that he's helping people
and maybe it's helping some people,

288
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:19,620
but he's also peddling a lot of,

289
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:20,454
Whoa,

290
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,380
I think,

291
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,000
I think he probably is helping a lot of,

292
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:23,480
yeah,

293
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,400
I think he's definitely
peddling a lot of woo.

294
00:09:25,401 --> 00:09:29,210
And the one thing that I always get out
of him is that I don't think even he

295
00:09:29,211 --> 00:09:30,500
knows what he's saying.

296
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,690
I think there's a lot of times where
we'll put the people and we'll try to

297
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,450
impress upon you then what
they're saying is important.

298
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:43,430
And one of the ways they do that is by
using these like really kind of like

299
00:09:43,431 --> 00:09:44,630
vague terms.

300
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:46,220
That sound fantastic.

301
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:46,551
Yeah.

302
00:09:46,551 --> 00:09:47,271
I mean that's really,

303
00:09:47,271 --> 00:09:49,190
I think where that term
pseudoscience comes from.

304
00:09:49,191 --> 00:09:50,390
It's not real science.

305
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:50,601
It's,

306
00:09:50,601 --> 00:09:50,881
it's,

307
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,280
it's fake science.

308
00:09:52,281 --> 00:09:53,300
It's bad science.

309
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,330
But it sorta sounds like
science to an untrained ear.

310
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,210
And that's the dangerous thing is if you
throw around a lot of really big words

311
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:00,770
and you are really authoritative,

312
00:10:00,771 --> 00:10:04,310
a lot of people kind of believe what
you're telling them what also there,

313
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,900
there's an issue in that.

314
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:10,040
Some of it does have some truth to it
and when you fuck around and pretend that

315
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,740
it all does what you mush it all together,

316
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,180
you,

317
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:13,391
you,

318
00:10:13,391 --> 00:10:13,640
you,

319
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,500
you create this really cloudy atmosphere.

320
00:10:15,501 --> 00:10:16,030
Well I'm under,

321
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,010
I'm not sure what the fuck you're saying
and I'm not sure if it's true and it's

322
00:10:19,011 --> 00:10:21,350
really hard for like an
everyday person who goes,

323
00:10:21,351 --> 00:10:21,591
okay,

324
00:10:21,591 --> 00:10:23,540
well I've heard that before and you know,

325
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,160
my doctor told me that and you know,

326
00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:26,180
that seems important.

327
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,850
And then they throw in all
these other things will,

328
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,241
I mean,

329
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:31,640
if you're an authority figure and you're
saying all these things that are true,

330
00:10:31,641 --> 00:10:32,540
I guess I should believe you.

331
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,620
When you say all these other things,

332
00:10:33,621 --> 00:10:34,580
it's a really dangerous,

333
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,600
um,

334
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,310
you know,

335
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,800
that's the,

336
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,850
that's it right up there.

337
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:39,621
He says,

338
00:10:39,621 --> 00:10:43,220
I was an atheist Hashtag
until I discovered I was God.

339
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,151
And then I said,

340
00:10:44,151 --> 00:10:44,511
son,

341
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:45,680
don't make me smack you.

342
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,880
We'll peddle bunch.

343
00:10:46,881 --> 00:10:47,960
And then he responded.

344
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:49,400
He responded something really funny.

345
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:50,390
I don't know if you can find it.

346
00:10:50,391 --> 00:10:50,631
Yeah.

347
00:10:50,631 --> 00:10:52,250
Like I roll God in drag.

348
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:53,511
Yeah.

349
00:10:53,511 --> 00:10:54,930
We're all God in drag.

350
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,350
That actually is very funny.

351
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,371
I was like,

352
00:10:58,371 --> 00:10:58,491
oh,

353
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,420
that's pretty awesome.

354
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,120
No,

355
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,120
he did a thing with his son where his
son followed him around with a camera and

356
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:08,490
completely exposed him.

357
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,230
And he went on tour,

358
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:15,410
like promoted this with his son and did
like interviews on like opie and Anthony

359
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:16,590
and all these different places.

360
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:18,480
But one of them was like his son,

361
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:21,810
like caught him sleeping when he
was supposed to be meditating.

362
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:23,610
I'm going to the tumbled to meditate.

363
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,121
I mean,

364
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:25,140
they go into the tumbleweeds,

365
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,410
he's completely out cold
line on his back and it's,

366
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,010
it's,

367
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,380
it's quite funny because his son sort of,

368
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:31,831
you know,

369
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:36,090
grew up with him and his sons and
fathers have notoriously contentious

370
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:36,924
relationships.

371
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,920
I'm always incredibly impressed when I
meet a daughter who gets along great with

372
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:45,450
her mom or a son who gets along great
with his dad because somewhere along the

373
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:46,860
line and those male,

374
00:11:46,861 --> 00:11:47,400
male,

375
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:47,761
female,

376
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:48,690
female relationships,

377
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,840
there seems to be this like changing of
the guard or something like that or this

378
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:53,010
need to be your own.

379
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,363
And

380
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,250
[inaudible] son has that shit in buckets,

381
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,320
buckets full of that.

382
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:01,930
And it's cool that Deepak doesn't
really take himself too seriously.

383
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:02,561
It's cool that he,

384
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:02,831
you know,

385
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:04,360
his son catches him asleep and he's like,

386
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:04,541
yeah,

387
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,720
but put it on the Internet.

388
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,593
And again,

389
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,770
I was not,

390
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,650
was traveling,

391
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,330
it was a way I was,

392
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:13,030
my third eye was open
to the possibilities.

393
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,633
Yeah.

394
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:15,843
He did a,

395
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,300
uh,

396
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:21,300
an interview or a debate rather with
Richard Dawkins fairly recently on,

397
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,710
I think it was,

398
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,430
uh,

399
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,550
he was challenging Dawkins on the
concept of atheism and you know,

400
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,520
and Dawkins was just being
his cadre old country settled,

401
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:38,150
but it actually made it actually
made him Dawkins look bad.

402
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:39,621
That's the thing.

403
00:12:39,621 --> 00:12:39,790
It's,

404
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,640
it's when you engage in those kinds of
conversations with people who can really

405
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:43,474
hold their own,

406
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,430
you've gotta be really
careful because Dawkins,

407
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,250
I think he's take and I
respect the man immensely.

408
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,980
His take is very much an educated,

409
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:51,161
you know,

410
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:52,240
I'm an evolutionist,

411
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:53,590
I'm an evolutionary biologist.

412
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,930
These are the reasons that
I don't believe in God,

413
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,150
but he's very hard lined about it.

414
00:12:58,151 --> 00:13:01,930
And there is something about
being this kind of ivory tower,

415
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:05,350
British elite that just kind
of makes you seem like a dick.

416
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,581
He's not a dick.

417
00:13:06,581 --> 00:13:07,690
He's a really sweet man.

418
00:13:07,691 --> 00:13:08,411
I've met him before.

419
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:08,860
He's,

420
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,980
he's soft spoken.

421
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,630
But the truth is you,

422
00:13:11,631 --> 00:13:13,690
you put those two men in a room together.

423
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:16,150
I mean Depok knows what he's doing.

424
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,480
He knows that like part of a debate
or part of the conversation is about

425
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:21,580
bringing out certain aspects
of somebody's character.

426
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:26,170
It's about likability and I think it's
easy for people who aren't already kind

427
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:30,250
of hard lined atheist and
who aren't already big dock
and supporters to be like,

428
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,690
that guy seems mean.

429
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:32,741
Well,

430
00:13:32,741 --> 00:13:33,850
I think he is mean.

431
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,780
I disagree with you.

432
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:40,300
I think he is a dick and I think he is
mean and I think that's because he's had

433
00:13:40,301 --> 00:13:43,690
to deal with idiots over and over
and over again and he's an extremely

434
00:13:43,691 --> 00:13:45,980
intelligent man and he's tired of it.

435
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,600
It could be that and it gets this
quivering and his lips when he talks to

436
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:50,320
people,

437
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,680
no,

438
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,100
that's not what's going on.

439
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:56,620
Then it gets so furious about defending
science and defending the truth.

440
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:02,050
I don't think he's a dick in an unjust
way and he's a dick for a reason.

441
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,300
He's a Dick because he's a normal guy.

442
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:08,110
I think he's also a dick because he's a
normal guy with a lot of knowledge that

443
00:14:08,111 --> 00:14:11,230
doesn't have a lot of
release in his life probably.

444
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:11,861
And he's also,

445
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:13,990
I think he's also sheltered
a little bit because of the,

446
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,190
his position because of,

447
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:15,551
you know,

448
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,490
when you work in academia and you're
kind of surrounded by likeminded people a

449
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:22,600
lot and only periodically do you go out
into the real world where there's a lot

450
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:25,090
of people who don't have the education
that you have and who have totally

451
00:14:25,091 --> 00:14:27,040
different values and belief systems.

452
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:27,500
Uh,

453
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,450
I'm sure it can be really,

454
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,630
really frustrating because
you're constantly having
to defend a position that's

455
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:34,990
the rational position that like anybody
else who's come up through the ranks

456
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:35,824
that you came up,

457
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:36,281
uh,

458
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:36,521
you know,

459
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:40,300
97% of practicing scientists or
something like that don't believe in God.

460
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,800
And maybe it's not that high,

461
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:43,120
but 97% definitely,

462
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,450
you know,

463
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,040
know that global warming is true.

464
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:48,490
And I think maybe it's something like
75% in America don't believe in God.

465
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,150
Um,

466
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,710
but we're like a very religious country.

467
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,070
But when you kind of go

468
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,190
through the motions and you just come
to these logical conclusions because of

469
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:56,750
all of the different
life choices you've made,

470
00:14:56,751 --> 00:15:00,740
but then you interact with people who
are from such different background,

471
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:02,540
who have never studied evolution,

472
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:03,560
who have never studied,

473
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,011
you know,

474
00:15:04,011 --> 00:15:05,210
global climate change or whatever.

475
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:10,040
It's like talking to a wall sometimes
because you almost can't have the same

476
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,610
kind of reasonable conversations because
when you're talking to somebody who's

477
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:17,300
not coming from a rational
evidence based place,

478
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,770
who's coming from kind of appeals to
emotion or who's coming from folklore or

479
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:22,700
whatever reason,

480
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:25,310
they have to defend their
kind of belief structure,

481
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:26,450
their faith position.

482
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:30,020
It's really frustrating because you don't
really have a lot of ammunition at a

483
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:30,854
certain point,

484
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:34,250
but especially when you're talking to
somebody like Ge Chopra who has like made

485
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:37,730
a career kind of being good at debating,

486
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:41,570
who knows exactly the way to twist your
words and to make it sound like what he

487
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:42,920
is speaking is the truth.

488
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,920
And then he's got this like
very benevolent kind of
kind and calm demeanor and

489
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,480
he's gonna make Dawkins look like a dick.

490
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:50,671
Oh,

491
00:15:50,671 --> 00:15:51,070
see,

492
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,640
I didn't think that he did any,

493
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,481
any twisting them,

494
00:15:53,481 --> 00:15:54,314
any words at all?

495
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,150
Oh really?

496
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:55,550
No.

497
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,031
I think,

498
00:15:56,031 --> 00:15:56,450
you know,

499
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,400
he seemed like a woo peddler.

500
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:58,881
I mean,

501
00:15:58,881 --> 00:15:59,960
to use your term,

502
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:00,201
he,

503
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:01,370
that's what he seems like,

504
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,500
but Dawkins was just getting so angry.

505
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:03,860
Yeah.

506
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,940
And it's that old saying,

507
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:05,300
you know,

508
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,630
never argue with an idiot because
people won't be able to tell who's who,

509
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:08,990
you know,

510
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,410
or that's not the same.

511
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:10,790
I don't know.

512
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,301
It works for me.

513
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:11,901
I would never,

514
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:12,170
like,

515
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,580
I would never debate a creation.

516
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:14,180
It's like people say,

517
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:14,421
Oh,

518
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:14,901
you should blah,

519
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:15,021
blah,

520
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:15,201
blah.

521
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:16,280
And I think like Bill Nye,

522
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:17,150
I don't know if it's happened yet,

523
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,530
but I suppose stowed debate.

524
00:16:18,531 --> 00:16:19,364
Ken Ham.

525
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,300
That's insane.

526
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:21,680
I don't know why he's doing it.

527
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,220
I mean,

528
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,090
I have friends,

529
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:23,211
you know,

530
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:26,840
I'm friends with Sean Carroll who's a
physicist at Caltech and writes these

531
00:16:26,841 --> 00:16:27,830
really great books about,

532
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,050
about time and about,

533
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,860
um,

534
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,490
uh,

535
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,271
quantum physics.

536
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:36,890
And he does periodically
debate creationists.

537
00:16:36,891 --> 00:16:37,311
And I'm always like,

538
00:16:37,311 --> 00:16:38,420
what are you doing?

539
00:16:38,421 --> 00:16:39,920
That sounds like such a bad idea.

540
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:40,191
You know,

541
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:44,030
like because these people are skilled
just in the art of conversation.

542
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,350
They're skilled in the art of debate.

543
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,690
Even if what they're saying has no weight,

544
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,530
they know how to argue these positions
and try and trap you and get you on the

545
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:52,040
defensive.

546
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,430
They have all of these
different kind of uh,

547
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,170
uh,

548
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,003
skillsets,

549
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,350
but he always says,

550
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:59,240
it's not for me.

551
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,460
It's not to try and prove him wrong.

552
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:04,460
It's not to try and convince
him not to believe in God.

553
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:04,810
You know,

554
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,210
like this guy is it,

555
00:17:06,211 --> 00:17:09,710
Ken Ham is like a hardcore
fundamentalist Christian.

556
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,390
We're never going to change his mind.

557
00:17:11,391 --> 00:17:14,420
So they say the reason that we do
these debates is for the people who are

558
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:16,100
sitting there watching who may be like,

559
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:16,281
Ooh,

560
00:17:16,281 --> 00:17:18,560
I don't know the difference between
evolution and intelligent design.

561
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:19,460
I've never thought about it.

562
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:24,170
I've never really looked at the evidence
that may be even a small percentage of

563
00:17:24,171 --> 00:17:26,210
the people who decide to tune in.

564
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,920
We'll be given some sort of information
that they didn't have before that they

565
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:33,200
can be armed with to
make better decisions.

566
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:34,250
But I don't know.

567
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:35,480
To me it just seems like,

568
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,610
I mean I think it's a noble pursuit,

569
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:38,630
but at the same time,

570
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,350
I'm not sure how effective it
really is to debate a creationist.

571
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:42,860
I say,

572
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,000
I disagree with you.

573
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:44,834
I think you'd,

574
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,540
I don't think you're going to
convince the creationist no.

575
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:47,781
Dot.

576
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:48,410
Not at all.

577
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,250
But I do think that there's,

578
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,250
there's value in someone who's good at it.

579
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:58,490
If someone has the ability to speak and
speak well and also they have to have a

580
00:17:58,651 --> 00:17:59,850
certain amount of charisma.

581
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,160
And I think the issue,

582
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:06,810
the Dawkins issue is that he gets so
emotionally invested in this fucking

583
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:11,220
horseshit that Depok spewing that he
gets angry and furious instead of mocking

584
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:11,341
him.

585
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:13,470
Like there's a brilliant exchange with a,

586
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:14,520
there was a scientist,

587
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:15,231
there was a,

588
00:18:15,231 --> 00:18:15,420
a,

589
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,970
a panel and Deepak was
on the panel and this,

590
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:18,301
this,

591
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:20,490
a scientists stepped up and uh,

592
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:25,550
asked Depok a question and Deepak
clearly didn't know what the fuck he was

593
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,204
talking about.

594
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,240
But the way the guy handled it was very
sweet and he was smiling while he did

595
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:32,810
it.

596
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:36,930
Explain that he was in the process of
writing a book with Stephen Hawkings and

597
00:18:36,931 --> 00:18:39,080
that he was in the middle
of this and then that I,

598
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,601
I don't,

599
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:39,931
he's like,

600
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:41,460
I understand those words you said,

601
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,121
but uh,

602
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,710
I'm not sure if they mean anything.

603
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,180
The way he said it was,

604
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,320
it was adorable.

605
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:46,680
Like,

606
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,190
because the guy didn't lose his cool
and it made Depok look like a fucking

607
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:50,670
idiot.

608
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,031
Where's it?

609
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:52,710
The same guy got up and said,

610
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,370
you know,

611
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,960
what is this quantum talk?

612
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:58,500
You're talking a bunch of fucking
bullshit and shut up and you don't know.

613
00:18:58,890 --> 00:18:59,880
Then all of a sudden,

614
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:00,001
you know,

615
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:04,830
Deepak is this pudgy Indian
man that you're picking up
screams of racism and all

616
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,510
these other fucking
hot buttons get pushed.

617
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,230
Yeah.

618
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,100
I think the same thing can be done
skillfully with these creationists.

619
00:19:11,101 --> 00:19:12,360
Fellows like shy.

620
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:17,510
I think the idea behind creationism
is it's so preposterous in,

621
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,070
in the form that we see it in the form of,

622
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,550
you know,

623
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:20,791
not,

624
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,190
not in the form of something
created the universe,

625
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,400
whether it's some sort of a universal
force that creates stars or the reason why

626
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:31,080
Adam's exists in the first place.

627
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:34,170
All these like fundamental questions
that scientists have as to why the

628
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:36,270
structure of the universe is what it is.

629
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,523
There's that,

630
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:41,730
but then there's this book that has been
translated from other books and then

631
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,890
they're sticking to
this fucking crazy book.

632
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,500
Just point out the other shit
in the book that's ridiculous.

633
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,350
Like the shit in the book
about not being on the,

634
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,310
where to deploy different types of cloth.

635
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,151
And they do that.

636
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:52,980
Usually they'll point out the shit
in the book that's ridiculous.

637
00:19:52,981 --> 00:19:54,060
And they figure out,

638
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,420
you know,

639
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,410
and point out how,

640
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,550
if the book says this,

641
00:19:56,551 --> 00:20:01,551
you truly believe this in this century
and science has unequivocally disproven

642
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,140
what it is that you believe.

643
00:20:04,141 --> 00:20:04,321
You know,

644
00:20:04,321 --> 00:20:05,250
it's one thing to talk about,

645
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:06,084
like you said,

646
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:06,930
uh,

647
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:07,141
you know,

648
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:10,680
these big questions like what came before
the Big Bang or you know what a lot

649
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:10,801
of,

650
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:14,820
I feel like I'm intelligent design
advocates confused for example,

651
00:20:14,821 --> 00:20:17,940
evolution via natural
selection with a a biogenesis.

652
00:20:17,941 --> 00:20:22,941
So they confuse the idea of
how a organisms have evolved
over time with how life

653
00:20:23,971 --> 00:20:25,050
began in the first place,

654
00:20:25,051 --> 00:20:27,420
which is a fundamentally
different scientific question,

655
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:28,141
different topic,

656
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:30,240
totally different field of inquiry.

657
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,081
And so,

658
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:31,500
you know,

659
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,690
a lot of times what they do is
they appeal to these two questions.

660
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:34,380
They say like,

661
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:34,531
well,

662
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:36,390
you don't know what existed
before the Big Bang,

663
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:40,020
therefore God done mic drop every time.

664
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,260
And instead of kind of allowing that,

665
00:20:43,261 --> 00:20:44,190
it's to say,

666
00:20:44,191 --> 00:20:44,551
you know,

667
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:44,940
okay,

668
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,761
neither of us know why.

669
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:47,890
Why has God the first,

670
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,203
you know,

671
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,650
answer that you jumped to,

672
00:20:50,651 --> 00:20:54,040
let's look at all the other times when
you're saying that the answer is God and

673
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:57,490
we've disproven it over
and over and over and over.

674
00:20:57,491 --> 00:21:01,720
And just because we don't have all of
the answers to every question right now

675
00:21:01,721 --> 00:21:03,640
using the scientific
method doesn't mean that,

676
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:04,211
you know,

677
00:21:04,211 --> 00:21:05,470
through through new tools,

678
00:21:05,471 --> 00:21:09,220
through new lines of inquiry that we
might be able to answer those in the

679
00:21:09,221 --> 00:21:09,940
future.

680
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,110
It doesn't mean that like,

681
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,310
just because we don't have,

682
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:15,730
that doesn't mean that there aren't
other philosophical answers to these

683
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:19,180
questions that don't rely on this
like very fundamentalist view.

684
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,490
I think personally that for example,

685
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:23,020
Bill Nye is going to be
able to hold his own.

686
00:21:23,021 --> 00:21:24,430
He's a total bad ass.

687
00:21:24,431 --> 00:21:26,320
He's not going to lose
his cool and Ken Ham,

688
00:21:26,321 --> 00:21:28,240
if you've ever watched him in PE,

689
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,890
I mean he's a nut job.

690
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,090
Like he's a total oops,

691
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:31,660
some videos,

692
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,800
he's a total nutter butter and he will
lose his cool and he's totally not

693
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:37,600
likable like nothing about this guy.

694
00:21:37,601 --> 00:21:38,231
He's likable.

695
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:42,280
So I think that maybe that's why bill and
I was willing to do it cause I've seen

696
00:21:42,281 --> 00:21:42,671
Bill Nye,

697
00:21:42,671 --> 00:21:42,911
right?

698
00:21:42,911 --> 00:21:47,770
Go on like Bill O'reilly a million times
and there's kind of a mutual respect

699
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:48,011
there.

700
00:21:48,011 --> 00:21:48,181
He,

701
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:52,460
he deals with bill O'Reilly very well
and I'm always impressed and just do the

702
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,470
one where is the O'Reilly is like
the Todd comes in to do that.

703
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,820
You can't explain that.

704
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:58,001
Yeah,

705
00:21:58,001 --> 00:21:58,751
he was with Steve.

706
00:21:58,751 --> 00:21:59,610
I'm with God.

707
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,260
Yeah.

708
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,093
Yeah.

709
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,710
It was so fucking funny.

710
00:22:02,711 --> 00:22:02,951
I mean,

711
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:05,630
it's such a face balm.

712
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,913
It's,

713
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,040
he's a bullshitter I think.

714
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,240
I think he's a panderer.

715
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:11,140
I think what he's doing,

716
00:22:11,141 --> 00:22:11,290
he's,

717
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,620
he knows that there's a bunch of fucking
scared old ladies bibles in their hand

718
00:22:14,621 --> 00:22:16,690
that listened to his show
and he's on their side.

719
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,171
Totally.

720
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:17,411
I mean,

721
00:22:17,411 --> 00:22:17,621
he's,

722
00:22:17,621 --> 00:22:22,621
and he's honestly not even as bad as
rush Limbaugh and fucking who's the other

723
00:22:24,581 --> 00:22:25,150
guy?

724
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,050
The Mormon guy.

725
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,363
Glenn Beck.

726
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,290
The late in life Mormon guy.

727
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:30,530
Yeah,

728
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:31,363
exactly.

729
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:32,790
You know,

730
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,371
I was Mormon.

731
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:35,970
Did we have this conversation
last time I was on,

732
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,660
I was raised Mormon.

733
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:38,500
Yeah.

734
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,311
My folks are still,

735
00:22:39,311 --> 00:22:40,240
well my dad's still Mormon.

736
00:22:40,241 --> 00:22:42,730
His whole side of the
family or are you from Utah?

737
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:43,000
No,

738
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,833
I'm from Texas.

739
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,230
Wow.

740
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,210
Mormon Texas.

741
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,040
There's a,

742
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,650
I mean,

743
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:47,483
what could everywhere.

744
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,423
They're everywhere,

745
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:48,911
but uh,

746
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:49,121
yeah,

747
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:49,870
born and raised.

748
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:50,380
Um,

749
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,400
less attrition has 14.

750
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,750
Wow.

751
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:54,160
When you were 14,

752
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,960
what was it that got you to,

753
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,160
I just didn't like I was,

754
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:57,420
it's,

755
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,181
it's so funny too,

756
00:22:58,181 --> 00:22:59,650
because I hadn't found science yet.

757
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,040
It's not like I knew I didn't have
like all these answers available to me.

758
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:05,380
I just probably around like 12,

759
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,221
maybe 11,

760
00:23:06,221 --> 00:23:07,930
like when you start questioning things,

761
00:23:07,931 --> 00:23:11,140
I really started questioning things and
a lot of things weren't making sense for

762
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:11,500
me.

763
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,490
And uh,

764
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:12,791
you know,

765
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,610
just a lot of the answers that they give
you an the church like weren't sitting

766
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:16,121
well with me.

767
00:23:16,121 --> 00:23:19,330
And so I was studying and I
was trying to figure out like,

768
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:19,891
you know,

769
00:23:19,891 --> 00:23:21,010
I've been taught this is my whole life,

770
00:23:21,011 --> 00:23:22,300
but it just doesn't make sense.

771
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:23,920
It doesn't sit well with reality.

772
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,900
And I remember going to
my father and saying,

773
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:26,111
you know,

774
00:23:26,111 --> 00:23:27,130
I have all these questions.

775
00:23:27,131 --> 00:23:28,120
I'm very confused.

776
00:23:28,121 --> 00:23:28,541
I'm not sure.

777
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:29,201
I believe.

778
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:32,260
And the answer they always give you
is just to like really pray about it.

779
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:32,501
You know,

780
00:23:32,501 --> 00:23:35,080
it's like they give you all of these
answers that aren't helping at all.

781
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:35,500
They don't,

782
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,720
they don't really improve
your confusion at all.

783
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,450
And so ultimately I finally
just came to him and said,

784
00:23:40,451 --> 00:23:40,601
like,

785
00:23:40,601 --> 00:23:40,890
I,

786
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:41,440
I,

787
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,140
I'm pretty sure at this point that
I really don't believe in God.

788
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:44,680
And,

789
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,980
and attending,

790
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,650
which is a huge part of
your life when you're 14.

791
00:23:48,651 --> 00:23:48,861
I mean,

792
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:50,660
when you're in high
school and you're Mormon,

793
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,740
you go to church for three hours every
Sunday you go to youth group every

794
00:23:54,741 --> 00:23:57,830
Wednesday night you have all sorts of
family things like family home evening

795
00:23:57,831 --> 00:23:58,461
every Monday night.

796
00:23:58,461 --> 00:24:00,200
And then you go to seminary,

797
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:01,070
which is either Bible,

798
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:04,730
book of Mormon and then like pearl of
great price in doctrine and covenants

799
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:09,530
study every morning before school I would
go at 6:00 AM for like an hour before

800
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,364
school.

801
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:10,761
And it's,

802
00:24:10,761 --> 00:24:12,020
I mean it's really intense.

803
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:13,280
It takes up a huge part of your life.

804
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:15,230
And when you don't believe it's kind of,

805
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,880
I mean you have to come out,

806
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,721
you have to come out.

807
00:24:17,721 --> 00:24:18,051
Like it's,

808
00:24:18,051 --> 00:24:19,550
it's so painful.

809
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:21,800
Like you're stuck in
this skin that's not you.

810
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:22,610
And I mean,

811
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:23,091
obviously,

812
00:24:23,091 --> 00:24:27,260
I don't know what it's like for
somebody who is gay who's like,

813
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,123
you know,

814
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,260
scared to come out in their community.

815
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:30,891
But,

816
00:24:30,891 --> 00:24:31,700
um,

817
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,120
I would assume that there's like at least
a faint similarity to that feeling of

818
00:24:35,121 --> 00:24:35,690
like,

819
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,990
I can't live like this because
I'm lying to myself every day.

820
00:24:38,991 --> 00:24:41,750
So I finally came out to my
father and it was like not good.

821
00:24:41,751 --> 00:24:43,010
It was a difficult situation.

822
00:24:43,011 --> 00:24:45,550
It was hard for the family
and I didn't end up like,

823
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,620
I ended up actually not having a
relationship with them for many years.

824
00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:48,741
It's,

825
00:24:48,741 --> 00:24:49,010
it's,

826
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:49,701
it's better now,

827
00:24:49,701 --> 00:24:52,040
but at the time it was like
a really intense thing,

828
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,780
like as a 14 year old kid to be like,

829
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:57,380
oh I need to make this like
really intense life decision.

830
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,270
So your dad didn't want to interact with
you or you didn't want to interact with

831
00:25:02,271 --> 00:25:02,511
him?

832
00:25:02,511 --> 00:25:04,190
He pressure it was like,

833
00:25:04,191 --> 00:25:04,361
so,

834
00:25:04,361 --> 00:25:05,480
so my parents were divorced,

835
00:25:05,481 --> 00:25:08,510
so I went to my dad's house every
other weekend and then like,

836
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,400
I think like a month in the
summer or something like that.

837
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,970
But we also went to his house on Sundays
to go to church together cause my mom

838
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:15,710
wasn't attending after they got divorced.

839
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:18,290
And so he basically told me,

840
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:18,770
um,

841
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:19,760
I remember the quote to this day,

842
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:23,360
I have a moral obligation to God to
force you to go to church until you're 18

843
00:25:23,361 --> 00:25:23,841
years old,

844
00:25:23,841 --> 00:25:25,430
as long as you're living under my roof.

845
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:25,941
And I was like,

846
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,140
I'm not gonna go anymore.

847
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:27,591
And he was like,

848
00:25:27,591 --> 00:25:29,690
well then I guess you're not going
to live under my roof anymore.

849
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:30,490
Yeah.

850
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,880
So it was a really tough decision.

851
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:36,881
It was kind of like me or me or your
atheism and at the time I just felt like I

852
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:39,440
can't not make this decision.

853
00:25:39,441 --> 00:25:40,700
So we didn't speak for a long time.

854
00:25:40,701 --> 00:25:43,040
And I like didn't go to his
house for a really long time.

855
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:43,910
We didn't have a relationship,

856
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:46,040
but it improved over time.

857
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,500
It improved your very smart person.

858
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,880
I always assume that that's genetic or
it was assumed that there's at least some

859
00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:54,410
element of that that's genetic.

860
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,050
I mean,

861
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:55,883
there,

862
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,950
it's intelligence is,

863
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,340
um,

864
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,120
thank you by the way.

865
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,830
But intelligence is a really,

866
00:26:00,831 --> 00:26:03,860
really complicated topic in
neuroscience and psychology.

867
00:26:03,861 --> 00:26:07,880
And so there's really not a lot of
evidence available that says that

868
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,060
intellectual ability is hereditary.

869
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,561
I have a friend,

870
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:13,191
he's dumb,

871
00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:13,881
his wives dumb,

872
00:26:13,881 --> 00:26:15,020
their kids stupid as fuck.

873
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:15,690
Okay,

874
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:16,523
there's something there.

875
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,140
There probably is something there.

876
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,060
And especially in terms of,

877
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,190
especially in terms of environment.

878
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,680
So a lot of times what can happen is that,

879
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:25,910
let's say that you have to,

880
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,590
you,

881
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,130
they do these twin studies all the time.

882
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,870
It's one of the only real ways
with human behavior to um,

883
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,150
to understand pure genetics,

884
00:26:35,151 --> 00:26:35,331
right?

885
00:26:35,331 --> 00:26:38,810
Because like my sister and I have
very different lives and we have very

886
00:26:38,811 --> 00:26:41,420
different personalities and we have
very different intellectual abilities.

887
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,920
But my sister and I are genetically,

888
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,000
even though we came from
the same source DNA,

889
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:45,541
right?

890
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:46,021
Half Mom,

891
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:46,800
half dad,

892
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,940
it's all shuffled together.

893
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:51,090
You didn't get the same millennials on
your genes and we are literally night and

894
00:26:51,091 --> 00:26:51,570
day.

895
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:56,400
But if you took two people who were
monozygotic twins who are identical twins

896
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:00,450
and those two kids got adopted out when
they were babies and they were raised by

897
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:01,890
two totally different people.

898
00:27:01,891 --> 00:27:02,940
And this happens in nature,

899
00:27:02,941 --> 00:27:04,110
a letter or not nature,

900
00:27:04,111 --> 00:27:04,471
but you know,

901
00:27:04,471 --> 00:27:06,030
it happens in society a lot.

902
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:08,190
And you study those two kids,

903
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,840
you'll find that the kid who grew up
in an impoverished environment with,

904
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:13,703
um,

905
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,161
you know,

906
00:27:14,161 --> 00:27:16,710
who wasn't getting appropriate
or adequate nutrition,

907
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:21,420
whose parents were not highly intelligent
or educated versus the kid who grew up

908
00:27:21,421 --> 00:27:24,390
in this very rich environment like this,

909
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,780
the kid who grew up in the impoverished
environment will not be as intelligent.

910
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,450
Like a huge part of it is environmental,

911
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,410
a huge part.

912
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,310
Same thing with my,

913
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:32,491
I mean,

914
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:33,480
you see it in animals to,

915
00:27:33,481 --> 00:27:36,330
you put a mouse in a cage with nothing
there and you put a mouse in a cage with

916
00:27:36,331 --> 00:27:38,130
all sorts of amazing things
for it to interact with.

917
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,870
Its brain is going to,

918
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,970
to actually grow larger,

919
00:27:41,971 --> 00:27:44,010
you're going to see more
kind of neural interactions,

920
00:27:44,011 --> 00:27:45,090
much more intense,

921
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:45,960
um,

922
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,580
branching of different neurons.

923
00:27:47,581 --> 00:27:51,000
So now that's not to say that
there's not a genetic component,

924
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:53,850
it's just very hard to pinpoint
what the genetic component is.

925
00:27:53,851 --> 00:27:56,550
It's been kind of an enigma
to be able to chase that.

926
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,990
It totally makes sense.

927
00:27:57,991 --> 00:27:58,171
I mean,

928
00:27:58,171 --> 00:28:00,810
there's so many different
variables and so many,

929
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:03,360
and like let's say you have a friend
who's dumb and his wife is dumb,

930
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,420
their kid might be dumb
because they don't know.

931
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:06,841
You know,

932
00:28:06,841 --> 00:28:10,290
it's like they're not speaking
intelligently to the child.

933
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:10,621
They don't,

934
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:13,230
they don't have a really great
grasp of the English language.

935
00:28:13,231 --> 00:28:15,300
They're probably not reading
very challenging books.

936
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:19,740
But sometimes you do see parents who may
be are limited but they so desperately

937
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:21,720
want everything that their kid deserves.

938
00:28:21,721 --> 00:28:22,554
And the kid,

939
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:22,831
you know,

940
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:26,340
shines intellectually from the time their
kid and they really foster that even

941
00:28:26,341 --> 00:28:29,340
though they might not even be able to
have an intelligent conversation with

942
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:30,120
their kid,

943
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,070
they're going to put their kid in
a great school and they're going,

944
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,281
oh,

945
00:28:32,281 --> 00:28:32,761
he's so,

946
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:33,451
he's so gifted.

947
00:28:33,451 --> 00:28:34,800
I want to make sure he's
always taken care of.

948
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,660
And that kid might grow up to be,

949
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:37,171
you know,

950
00:28:37,171 --> 00:28:39,420
just a little genius and you see it a lot,

951
00:28:39,421 --> 00:28:39,631
you know,

952
00:28:39,631 --> 00:28:42,540
you see it where a child
grows up to be this really,

953
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,673
um,

954
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,131
you know,

955
00:28:44,131 --> 00:28:49,110
academic star and his parents maybe
weren't exactly on the same page.

956
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:49,781
Yeah,

957
00:28:49,781 --> 00:28:53,920
it is such a crap shoot when you deal
with life experiences and then you deal

958
00:28:53,921 --> 00:28:55,120
with education.

959
00:28:55,121 --> 00:28:55,720
I mean what,

960
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,180
just the teachers that you
get the school that you go to,

961
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,630
the books that someone
just by chance mate,

962
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:01,871
hey,

963
00:29:01,871 --> 00:29:02,830
you might be interested in this.

964
00:29:02,831 --> 00:29:03,790
And then boom,

965
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,020
a light bulb goes off,

966
00:29:05,021 --> 00:29:08,290
a new door opens up your mind and
then you start pursuing that path.

967
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,080
And then there's like
even silly things like,

968
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:10,441
you know,

969
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:10,701
do you,

970
00:29:10,701 --> 00:29:12,000
are you eating well?

971
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:13,290
Are you exercising?

972
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,330
Are you doing drugs?

973
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,530
Like those kinds of,

974
00:29:16,531 --> 00:29:16,681
yeah,

975
00:29:16,681 --> 00:29:17,071
exactly.

976
00:29:17,071 --> 00:29:18,540
But those kinds of things,

977
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:20,190
they're actually the most fundamental,

978
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:20,581
you know,

979
00:29:20,581 --> 00:29:21,990
because if you are,

980
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:26,520
there's actually a really high
correlation between intelligence and um,

981
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,230
or a,

982
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:30,690
a high inverse relationship between
intelligence and poverty because it's just

983
00:29:30,691 --> 00:29:31,980
when you were growing up and you,

984
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:33,930
you don't eat enough and
then you're going to school,

985
00:29:33,931 --> 00:29:34,681
you can't focus,

986
00:29:34,681 --> 00:29:35,670
you can't pay attention,

987
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,751
you don't sleep enough,

988
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:37,800
you're working an extra job.

989
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,130
It's just so hard to get
ahead of the game that way.

990
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,210
And so there's so many
different variables.

991
00:29:43,211 --> 00:29:46,240
And that's why I think fundamentally
whenever you have these conversations,

992
00:29:46,241 --> 00:29:46,991
like is it nature,

993
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:47,770
is it nurture?

994
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:47,891
Well,

995
00:29:47,891 --> 00:29:48,724
it's always both.

996
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,301
It's all,

997
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:51,310
almost everything is nature nurture.

998
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,250
There's some things that
are very heavily genetic,

999
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:56,590
like especially when it comes to deficits.

1000
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,700
Like if you're,

1001
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,241
you know,

1002
00:29:58,241 --> 00:30:01,990
if these two genes didn't split the right
way or if this cell migrated in this

1003
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:03,620
direction and it didn't work that way in,

1004
00:30:03,621 --> 00:30:04,361
and then you end up,

1005
00:30:04,361 --> 00:30:06,730
let's say with some
sort of intense genetic,

1006
00:30:06,731 --> 00:30:07,110
uh,

1007
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:07,780
uh,

1008
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,400
difficulty,

1009
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,020
you end up with a down
syndrome for example.

1010
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,090
There's only so much you can do,

1011
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,330
you can do a lot environmentally to
improve the lives it to approve your life

1012
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:17,410
and improve your abilities,

1013
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,850
but you still have down syndrome,

1014
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:19,211
right?

1015
00:30:19,211 --> 00:30:22,570
And so you still might be dealing with
something of a ceiling even though I

1016
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:25,150
think you can push that
ceiling up and vice versa.

1017
00:30:25,151 --> 00:30:25,481
You know,

1018
00:30:25,481 --> 00:30:30,481
you can do a lot kind of
environmentally to improve or whatever.

1019
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,510
Um,

1020
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,760
but there are still always
going to be some sort of,

1021
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,400
there's always going to be some
sort of like genetic component,

1022
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,080
but it is very difficult.

1023
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,020
Sometimes the lines get really blurred
and it's so hard to tell from the

1024
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:41,561
outside.

1025
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:44,110
That's why we do experiments with animals.

1026
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:48,190
I mean it's a really heavy reason that
geneticists so commonly use animals in

1027
00:30:48,191 --> 00:30:51,160
the lab because you can
clone a bunch of animals,

1028
00:30:51,161 --> 00:30:54,160
you can have a very specific
line of animals and then
you can do something where

1029
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:58,630
you change some sort of environmental
component or some sort of drug,

1030
00:30:58,631 --> 00:31:01,420
or you do something with the brain
of these 10 different mice will,

1031
00:31:01,421 --> 00:31:02,860
all of the mice were clones.

1032
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,160
So they started out
genetically exactly the same.

1033
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,200
So you can't do this in humans.

1034
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:11,530
You can't like make sure every other
variable is kept the same and then only

1035
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:14,620
manipulate one variable because
we just grow up with these rich,

1036
00:31:14,621 --> 00:31:15,454
intense,

1037
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,690
interesting lives.

1038
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,100
But you can do that with animals,

1039
00:31:18,101 --> 00:31:21,220
which is why animal research is so
important to answer a lot of fundamental

1040
00:31:21,221 --> 00:31:22,054
questions.

1041
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,500
It's really kind of fucked if
you stop and think about it.

1042
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:27,900
There's like 300 million experiments
going on in this country.

1043
00:31:27,901 --> 00:31:29,030
I mean that's what humans are.

1044
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,370
We're all experiments were all like,

1045
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:35,330
this is what happens when someone plays
soccer from the time they were five.

1046
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:35,871
Exactly.

1047
00:31:35,871 --> 00:31:36,350
What happens.

1048
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,183
They only eat cake.

1049
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:38,660
Yes.

1050
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,860
What happens if your dad beats you?

1051
00:31:39,861 --> 00:31:41,510
This is what happens if
your parents ignore you.

1052
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:46,220
Can you imagine if like your dad or
your mom was a really intense kind of a

1053
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,430
cognitive psychologist or
experimental psychologists?

1054
00:31:49,431 --> 00:31:49,870
Like,

1055
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:50,091
you know,

1056
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:50,601
there's all these,

1057
00:31:50,601 --> 00:31:50,861
I don't,

1058
00:31:50,861 --> 00:31:53,000
I don't think that they're
necessarily true or,

1059
00:31:53,001 --> 00:31:54,230
I'm not sure how much
truth there is to it,

1060
00:31:54,231 --> 00:31:58,040
but there's all these like
tales about like BF Skinner,

1061
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:01,340
who's probably one of the most
famous behaviorists and in history,

1062
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,290
every psychology student
learns about Skinner.

1063
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:04,483
Um,

1064
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,091
you know,

1065
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:09,140
like Skinner has a kid and then like all
of the things that he might do to the,

1066
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,650
to the crib that his daughter
grows up in and exactly how,

1067
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:12,831
oh,

1068
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:14,780
I'm going to do an enrichment
experiment with my child.

1069
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:17,840
Like I cannot imagine that
would be really intense.

1070
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,221
Yeah,

1071
00:32:18,221 --> 00:32:18,601
that's a,

1072
00:32:18,601 --> 00:32:19,670
there's a lot at stake.

1073
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:20,570
Yeah.

1074
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,190
You kid might resent you for that.

1075
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:22,431
Yeah.

1076
00:32:22,431 --> 00:32:22,731
Well,

1077
00:32:22,731 --> 00:32:22,971
you know,

1078
00:32:22,971 --> 00:32:24,860
we all resigned her parents
for some reason or another,

1079
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:25,500
don't I?

1080
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,333
Yes,

1081
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:27,110
dude.

1082
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:27,471
There's,

1083
00:32:27,471 --> 00:32:28,070
um,

1084
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:28,511
there's a,

1085
00:32:28,511 --> 00:32:30,320
a story about a woman who,

1086
00:32:30,321 --> 00:32:30,861
uh,

1087
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:33,110
owned a comedy club and had
a son who was a comedian.

1088
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,610
And when he would cry when he was younger,

1089
00:32:34,611 --> 00:32:37,190
she would ignore him because she
felt like if she ignored him,

1090
00:32:37,191 --> 00:32:38,090
he grew up funny.

1091
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,550
Yeah.

1092
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,900
And it probably is true.

1093
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:42,890
No,

1094
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:43,480
not funny.

1095
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:43,971
It didn't work.

1096
00:32:43,971 --> 00:32:44,900
It wasn't fine at all.

1097
00:32:44,901 --> 00:32:46,070
He grew up to be a con.

1098
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:46,350
Yeah.

1099
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,480
I grew up super depressed.

1100
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,680
It's just shitty human.

1101
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,550
But there is kind of,

1102
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:50,301
it's interesting,

1103
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:50,511
you know,

1104
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:52,070
there's a recent study actually,

1105
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:52,431
and I'm,

1106
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:55,100
I don't know how much stock I put into
this because whenever there's like a

1107
00:32:55,101 --> 00:32:57,410
single study that gets a
lot of media attention,

1108
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,760
that's how we do it in,

1109
00:32:58,761 --> 00:33:02,990
in this country specifically when it
comes to the media and science were really

1110
00:33:02,991 --> 00:33:04,160
bad about picking up.

1111
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:04,551
Oh,

1112
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:06,200
that study is really interesting.

1113
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:07,700
So let's,

1114
00:33:07,701 --> 00:33:08,534
um,

1115
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,420
let's pick it up and all the different
media outlets are going to talk about

1116
00:33:11,421 --> 00:33:13,700
this one study where we got one,

1117
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:14,271
you know,

1118
00:33:14,271 --> 00:33:17,540
a dose of results and we're
going to say it like it's truth,

1119
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:17,811
right?

1120
00:33:17,811 --> 00:33:20,480
But there was this recent study that uh,

1121
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:22,760
we're all these different
comedians I guess.

1122
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,140
I think it was in the UK actually were,

1123
00:33:25,141 --> 00:33:25,491
yeah,

1124
00:33:25,491 --> 00:33:28,700
like answered a self report questionnaire
and they found that there's a really

1125
00:33:28,701 --> 00:33:31,820
high percentage of um,

1126
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:32,990
it wasn't psychopathy,

1127
00:33:32,991 --> 00:33:33,530
it was,

1128
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,100
uh,

1129
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,900
it was psychotic,

1130
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:38,690
a personality traits in Comedians.

1131
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,910
And so it's actually
kind of interested in,

1132
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,680
in almost every comedian I talked to.

1133
00:33:42,681 --> 00:33:44,690
It's always like most comedians
are kind of fucked up.

1134
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:44,931
Like,

1135
00:33:44,931 --> 00:33:45,440
it's like,

1136
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:45,741
you know,

1137
00:33:45,741 --> 00:33:46,101
they're,

1138
00:33:46,101 --> 00:33:48,320
they're anecdotal kind of stories.

1139
00:33:48,321 --> 00:33:51,170
Are a lot of comedians deal with this
or they deal with that and you know,

1140
00:33:51,171 --> 00:33:54,680
that humor is kind of a tool that a
lot of comedians develop over their

1141
00:33:54,681 --> 00:33:55,514
lifetime.

1142
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,000
I think,

1143
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,580
especially Comedians who
specifically have like a shtick.

1144
00:33:58,581 --> 00:33:59,330
Like,

1145
00:33:59,330 --> 00:33:59,811
you know,

1146
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:00,950
I deal with weight issues,

1147
00:34:00,951 --> 00:34:02,360
so all my jokes are about my weight,

1148
00:34:02,361 --> 00:34:04,340
ideal with my bad
relationship with my parents.

1149
00:34:04,341 --> 00:34:05,690
So all my jokes are about that.

1150
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:06,920
And um,

1151
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:07,150
yeah,

1152
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:07,310
I,

1153
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:07,731
I mean,

1154
00:34:07,731 --> 00:34:08,150
I dunno,

1155
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,860
I don't think you can make any
sort of blanket statements.

1156
00:34:09,861 --> 00:34:13,160
There's probably like incredibly high
functioning people who have never dealt

1157
00:34:13,161 --> 00:34:14,240
with mental illness at all.

1158
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:19,280
But I think there is some sort of like
really beautiful truth in comedy where,

1159
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:19,881
you know,

1160
00:34:19,881 --> 00:34:22,880
there are a lot of people who are
very highly skilled at taking these

1161
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:26,360
fundamentally human challenges
that we all deal with.

1162
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:26,810
Uh,

1163
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,220
whether it's mental illness,

1164
00:34:28,221 --> 00:34:33,221
whether it's feelings of regret or
feelings of loneliness or feeling like you

1165
00:34:33,231 --> 00:34:38,231
don't fit in and using humor as a tool
to really deliver these kinds of very

1166
00:34:38,631 --> 00:34:40,040
universal messages.

1167
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:41,420
And there's a skill in that.

1168
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:46,070
And I wonder if it's that maybe we
all deal a little bit with psychotic

1169
00:34:46,071 --> 00:34:46,881
personality traits.

1170
00:34:46,881 --> 00:34:48,500
We all deal a little bit with depression,

1171
00:34:48,501 --> 00:34:49,310
with anxiety,

1172
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:49,940
you know,

1173
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:54,080
pick your poison and that
a lot of comedians are much
more in touch with that.

1174
00:34:54,081 --> 00:34:58,550
They figured out a way to have this
vehicle for talking about these very human

1175
00:34:58,551 --> 00:35:02,000
experiences and they do it in such a way
that we can all kind of share in it and

1176
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:03,830
laugh together about it.

1177
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,000
I mean,

1178
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,540
I dunno,

1179
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,050
but,

1180
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:06,720
well,

1181
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,170
I read that study and I thought one of
the things it's a found issue with is

1182
00:35:10,171 --> 00:35:12,360
that they found 500
funny people in England.

1183
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,403
Yeah,

1184
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,480
I seriously,

1185
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,613
I don't see that.

1186
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:20,070
Maybe for England actually
never been to England.

1187
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:20,941
Have you been to English?

1188
00:35:20,941 --> 00:35:21,450
Great.

1189
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,283
I want to go.

1190
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:22,921
I'm fucking around.

1191
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:23,580
I love it over there.

1192
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:23,940
I've been,

1193
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,930
I've been all over Europe,

1194
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,351
but I've never,

1195
00:35:25,351 --> 00:35:26,190
it's like so strange.

1196
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:27,180
I've never been to like the,

1197
00:35:27,181 --> 00:35:29,970
the easiest country to travel to
because we speak the same language.

1198
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,211
Yeah,

1199
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:30,830
they're great.

1200
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:31,051
They're,

1201
00:35:31,051 --> 00:35:33,180
they're fantastic comedy club audiences.

1202
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,100
They love American stand up to their,

1203
00:35:35,101 --> 00:35:35,351
their,

1204
00:35:35,351 --> 00:35:38,040
their site type of standup
is different I'm sure.

1205
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,890
But they're huge fans of American standup.

1206
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:44,210
They tend to be witty and
a bit more reserved and um,

1207
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:44,730
you know,

1208
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,361
very good,

1209
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:47,700
great wordsmiths great writers.

1210
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,360
Um,

1211
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,640
but they,

1212
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,270
they studied 500 comedians.

1213
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:52,950
This is the thing,

1214
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,750
there's not that many comedians.

1215
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,010
If you took America,

1216
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,750
which is 300 million people and you said,

1217
00:35:57,751 --> 00:35:58,584
okay,

1218
00:35:58,770 --> 00:35:59,730
how many comedians are there?

1219
00:35:59,731 --> 00:36:04,050
There's maybe a thousand professional
comedians at a 300 million out of those

1220
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,100
thousand how many of
them are actually good?

1221
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:10,110
There's maybe 250 there might be 250
comedians in this country that are worth a

1222
00:36:10,111 --> 00:36:10,640
fuck.

1223
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:10,880
Yeah,

1224
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,100
it does make you question like how like
are they self described can be like how

1225
00:36:14,101 --> 00:36:16,870
did they find these people and
how do you get 500 in England?

1226
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,240
You're going to have 250 in America.

1227
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:18,481
I mean,

1228
00:36:18,481 --> 00:36:18,971
I just don't,

1229
00:36:18,971 --> 00:36:19,804
I don't buy it.

1230
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,270
Maybe they weren't
professional committees.

1231
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:21,571
We were,

1232
00:36:21,571 --> 00:36:23,460
they're just people who
found themselves to be funny.

1233
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,840
Well it's also,

1234
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:28,140
I don't know if their circuit
is as deep and wide is.

1235
00:36:28,141 --> 00:36:28,861
Ours is,

1236
00:36:28,861 --> 00:36:32,850
I mean you go to like New
York City has 20 comedy clubs,

1237
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,541
you know,

1238
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:35,370
I mean Los Angeles has,

1239
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,720
God knows how many,

1240
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,910
I mean we could just
sit here and just count.

1241
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,190
Especially when you count
the Greater La area,

1242
00:36:41,191 --> 00:36:46,191
you branch out to places like Braya and
Irvine and Ontario and La might have 50

1243
00:36:46,231 --> 00:36:47,230
fucking comedy clubs.

1244
00:36:47,231 --> 00:36:48,041
It's not just la,

1245
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:48,481
New York.

1246
00:36:48,481 --> 00:36:52,020
I mean every major city has at least
one or two comedy clubs and you know,

1247
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:52,860
comic go on tour.

1248
00:36:52,861 --> 00:36:56,670
I'll look at the country and really big
comics don't even play in comedy clubs

1249
00:36:56,671 --> 00:36:57,690
at a certain point,

1250
00:36:57,691 --> 00:36:58,081
you know,

1251
00:36:58,081 --> 00:36:58,321
they're,

1252
00:36:58,321 --> 00:37:01,110
they're packing theaters
and we still do though.

1253
00:37:01,111 --> 00:37:03,090
We still work our shit
out at comedy clubs.

1254
00:37:03,091 --> 00:37:03,924
You have to,

1255
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,993
at least for me,

1256
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,250
I find that there's a certain amount of,

1257
00:37:08,251 --> 00:37:08,630
um,

1258
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:08,780
the,

1259
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:12,780
the intimacy that you get in a comedy
club is you can't get that anywhere else

1260
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:14,460
in big theaters.

1261
00:37:14,461 --> 00:37:15,480
The big theater shows,

1262
00:37:15,481 --> 00:37:17,460
like I did the Chicago
theater this weekend,

1263
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:19,410
which is like 3000 plus seats.

1264
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,180
But like then I'll do the ice house,

1265
00:37:21,181 --> 00:37:21,931
like the little room,

1266
00:37:21,931 --> 00:37:23,010
which is 80 seats.

1267
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,990
But that 80 seat room is like,

1268
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,570
I'm sitting in like as close
as I am to you and you,

1269
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,800
if they're laughing,

1270
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:29,760
it's because it's funny.

1271
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:32,610
It's a real intimate sort of in a a thing,

1272
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,313
comedy,

1273
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:34,590
you know,

1274
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,210
to do it correctly in my opinion.

1275
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:37,920
And to be really in touch
with what you're doing.

1276
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:38,670
You need a,

1277
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:41,280
you need a lot of different
environments to do it in.

1278
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,420
I think that's smart.

1279
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:42,990
I mean to,

1280
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,090
to have kind of a lot of
different experiences.

1281
00:37:45,091 --> 00:37:48,240
So then you can really tell what sticks
and what works with different audiences.

1282
00:37:48,241 --> 00:37:50,070
And it's not just that,

1283
00:37:50,071 --> 00:37:53,730
it's also how you feel about
saying it to these people,

1284
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,340
how they react to it and
how that resonates with you.

1285
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:58,450
Because what a person says is,

1286
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,630
is not just like,

1287
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,360
this is what I have inside of me and uh,

1288
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:04,650
this is how you react to it.

1289
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:10,100
Comedy is one of the rare art forms
where you can't even practice it without

1290
00:38:10,261 --> 00:38:11,400
other people's input.

1291
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,580
And so it's not just what you're saying,

1292
00:38:14,581 --> 00:38:17,220
it's how like this
conversation that we're having,

1293
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:19,950
we'd be very different
if you were your dad,

1294
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,920
if you were the guy who's the
Mormon who is still sticking to you.

1295
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,590
So like the way I say
things would be different.

1296
00:38:25,591 --> 00:38:29,640
The way we would interact would
be different and much like,

1297
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:29,941
you know,

1298
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:32,670
we're talking about all the variables
that go into creating a human.

1299
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:37,150
There's also massive variables going
into just creating conversations.

1300
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:38,723
A conversation.

1301
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:42,580
One of the things that I'm finding about
podcasts is that a conversation really

1302
00:38:42,581 --> 00:38:47,581
is kind of a piece of art if you can
listen to it and it's really interesting

1303
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:53,470
and it becomes like something that's
enriching to you and inspiring to you and,

1304
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:58,740
and the person and the people that are
engaging in this conversation are careful

1305
00:38:58,871 --> 00:39:03,640
with the things that they say in terms
of like they're an intensely focusing on

1306
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:06,820
what they're saying and not just
just spitting out word salad.

1307
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:11,470
There's an art to that and that that
art gets to you and then just sort of

1308
00:39:11,471 --> 00:39:12,304
enriches you.

1309
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,460
I think that that conversation
and stand up comedy,

1310
00:39:15,461 --> 00:39:16,600
they're very similar in that way.

1311
00:39:16,601 --> 00:39:17,830
That standup comedy is like,

1312
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,450
it's,

1313
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:23,830
it's dependent almost entirely on the
environments that you do it in and the

1314
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:25,330
people that are that are experiencing it.

1315
00:39:25,331 --> 00:39:25,420
Yeah.

1316
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,400
And it seems like there's
kind of always a goal,

1317
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,060
um,

1318
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,570
whether it's spoken or not have
this sort of sense of universality.

1319
00:39:31,571 --> 00:39:32,410
The sense of like,

1320
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:35,410
just because you and I are having a
conversation right now doesn't mean that

1321
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:38,650
everybody at home who's listening
isn't a part of the conversation.

1322
00:39:38,651 --> 00:39:39,220
You know what I mean?

1323
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:43,720
I think it's so important that
the topics that we engage in,

1324
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,070
the things that we,

1325
00:39:45,071 --> 00:39:45,281
you know,

1326
00:39:45,281 --> 00:39:47,290
the emotions that we share have,

1327
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:47,580
uh,

1328
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,300
they resonate with other people.

1329
00:39:49,301 --> 00:39:50,980
And that's so important in comedy too.

1330
00:39:50,981 --> 00:39:51,880
Like there is,

1331
00:39:51,881 --> 00:39:55,480
I think there's something to be said about
just like a wacky person who says all

1332
00:39:55,481 --> 00:39:58,360
sorts of wacky things that are
totally out of step with everybody.

1333
00:39:58,361 --> 00:39:58,571
Oh,

1334
00:39:58,571 --> 00:40:00,700
that's so weird and
different and that's funny.

1335
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,890
But I think that would lose
it stick after a while.

1336
00:40:02,891 --> 00:40:05,640
I think part of what's really important
in comedy is that there's these like a

1337
00:40:05,641 --> 00:40:10,310
universal kind of themes that are
touched on that people really relate to.

1338
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:11,403
Because when you're like,

1339
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,220
ah,

1340
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,500
you're totally talking about me right now,

1341
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,960
it's cause we're like
fundamentally selfish.

1342
00:40:16,961 --> 00:40:19,930
And I think it's important
that when we watch TV,

1343
00:40:19,931 --> 00:40:20,261
when we're,

1344
00:40:20,261 --> 00:40:21,850
when we sit down and you know,

1345
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,920
pay money to be entertained,

1346
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,830
that it feels like you're talking to me,

1347
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:27,641
you know,

1348
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:29,200
not the person next to me but me,

1349
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,180
that I'm engaged in this conversation.

1350
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:31,620
It's,

1351
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,890
it's a part of our nature.

1352
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:33,701
And so I think that there,

1353
00:40:33,701 --> 00:40:34,121
there is,

1354
00:40:34,121 --> 00:40:34,601
like you said,

1355
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:35,920
a big art to that,

1356
00:40:35,921 --> 00:40:38,170
to reaching people,

1357
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,710
especially people who may be sometimes
don't feel like they're reached,

1358
00:40:41,711 --> 00:40:42,011
you know,

1359
00:40:42,011 --> 00:40:44,950
I can't watch two and a half men and
feel like it relates to me at all.

1360
00:40:44,951 --> 00:40:47,170
Like it's like the worst
fucking show on television.

1361
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,420
It's so not funny.

1362
00:40:49,421 --> 00:40:51,930
It's so does not speak to me
and I don't get it because it,

1363
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,220
it,

1364
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:52,490
it,

1365
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,190
it's like the most popular show,

1366
00:40:54,191 --> 00:40:54,401
you know,

1367
00:40:54,401 --> 00:40:55,180
everybody loves it.

1368
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,770
Or like duck dynasty for example.

1369
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,900
It's like one of the highest
rated shows of all time,

1370
00:40:58,901 --> 00:41:00,610
which is fucking insane to me.

1371
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,181
But,

1372
00:41:01,181 --> 00:41:02,014
um,

1373
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:02,981
but there is something,

1374
00:41:02,981 --> 00:41:03,371
I mean there,

1375
00:41:03,371 --> 00:41:06,430
there's a reason that these things do
really well is because there's a whole

1376
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:10,150
cross section of people that they find
it to be like really relatable for them.

1377
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:10,751
You know what I mean?

1378
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:12,010
And I think that there's an art in that.

1379
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,300
There's an art in creating television.

1380
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,830
There's an art and doing radio,

1381
00:41:14,831 --> 00:41:16,390
there's an art and doing comedy,

1382
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:19,270
any of these kind of
spoken word kind of avenues

1383
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,710
I think shows like two and a half men.

1384
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:22,050
Uh,

1385
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:26,630
especially duck dynasty is sort of
a trick because what duck dynasty is

1386
00:41:26,631 --> 00:41:31,040
pretending is that you're looking into
the lives of these wholesome God fearing,

1387
00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:31,370
you know,

1388
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:34,090
duck call chroma massive

1389
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:34,791
now.

1390
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:37,970
But what we find out now is
that they're just idiots.

1391
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,010
And that also they've been doctored up,

1392
00:41:40,011 --> 00:41:43,330
they've talked to these people and to
grow in those fucking beards and wearing

1393
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,640
cammo in doors and all the stupid
shit that they do is contrived.

1394
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,390
And Yeah,

1395
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,790
I do think that there's a
difference between feeling like,

1396
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,150
you know,

1397
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,860
I'm a part of this and
they're speaking to me.

1398
00:41:51,861 --> 00:41:56,810
And then there's this gross kind of a
base human desire to like be a voice to

1399
00:41:56,811 --> 00:42:00,440
like look in on somebody else's life
who has it worse off than you do so that

1400
00:42:00,441 --> 00:42:01,240
you can like,

1401
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:01,581
okay,

1402
00:42:01,581 --> 00:42:02,900
no matter how hard I have it,

1403
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:04,280
no matter what kind of
Shit I'm dealing with,

1404
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:08,120
these people are fucking freak shows and
they make me feel better about myself,

1405
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,320
which is such a gross.

1406
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:10,400
Like that's one thing,

1407
00:42:10,401 --> 00:42:10,641
you know,

1408
00:42:10,641 --> 00:42:11,870
I work in television,

1409
00:42:11,871 --> 00:42:15,350
but I've also done work in
journalism and you know,

1410
00:42:15,351 --> 00:42:16,250
I'm still,

1411
00:42:16,251 --> 00:42:16,401
you know,

1412
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:17,300
I'm 30 years old,

1413
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,890
I'm on my course,

1414
00:42:18,891 --> 00:42:19,760
my career course,

1415
00:42:19,761 --> 00:42:20,570
I've been successful.

1416
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:23,750
But at the same time you're always kind
of reinventing yourself and trying to

1417
00:42:23,751 --> 00:42:24,980
figure out your track in life.

1418
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,150
And one thing that I've,

1419
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:26,691
you know,

1420
00:42:26,691 --> 00:42:27,411
I go to,

1421
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:29,990
I take a lot of meetings in Hollywood,

1422
00:42:29,991 --> 00:42:30,980
I go to a lot of,

1423
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:31,791
you know,

1424
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:34,610
this person pitches this science show
and I really want to do this thing.

1425
00:42:34,611 --> 00:42:35,090
And it sounds like,

1426
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:35,361
okay,

1427
00:42:35,361 --> 00:42:35,571
cool,

1428
00:42:35,571 --> 00:42:36,351
that sounds interesting.

1429
00:42:36,351 --> 00:42:37,041
Let's talk about it.

1430
00:42:37,041 --> 00:42:38,000
We can take it to this network.

1431
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:41,540
And one of the things that I
fundamentally always say no to,

1432
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:43,040
I do draw a line in the sand.

1433
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,600
I don't have the luxury of,

1434
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,760
I don't have time to take that meeting,

1435
00:42:46,761 --> 00:42:47,000
you know,

1436
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,601
like that's not,

1437
00:42:47,601 --> 00:42:50,690
I'm not there by any stretch and I
don't think that that's even a goal.

1438
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:51,280
But,

1439
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,113
um,

1440
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:52,791
yeah,

1441
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:54,230
just to be able to say fuck off.

1442
00:42:54,231 --> 00:42:55,120
I know I'm better than.

1443
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:55,600
Yeah,

1444
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:55,910
but,

1445
00:42:55,910 --> 00:43:00,410
but the one thing is if I do go to a
meeting my fundamentals that I don't do

1446
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,410
what I have dumped kind
of humiliation television,

1447
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:06,620
it's not something I ever want
to have anything to do with,

1448
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:07,041
you know,

1449
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:07,281
in the,

1450
00:43:07,281 --> 00:43:09,980
in the industry they might
call it conflict reality.

1451
00:43:09,981 --> 00:43:12,170
There's all these
different euphemisms for,

1452
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:16,100
because what I do fundamentally is
reality TV because it's nonfiction

1453
00:43:16,101 --> 00:43:16,731
programming,

1454
00:43:16,731 --> 00:43:16,941
right?

1455
00:43:16,941 --> 00:43:17,031
I'm,

1456
00:43:17,031 --> 00:43:20,300
I'm mostly into the edutainment sphere.

1457
00:43:20,301 --> 00:43:21,920
I'm really interested in,

1458
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:22,371
you know,

1459
00:43:22,371 --> 00:43:24,330
science based programming
or political base program.

1460
00:43:24,331 --> 00:43:25,340
So it's all nonfiction.

1461
00:43:25,341 --> 00:43:26,720
So it's reality in a sense.

1462
00:43:26,721 --> 00:43:29,410
It's not scripted duck dynasty or the,

1463
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,591
or in the same,

1464
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:31,301
I know genres.

1465
00:43:31,301 --> 00:43:32,330
So for me specifically,

1466
00:43:32,331 --> 00:43:34,190
I call that kind of TV humiliation,

1467
00:43:34,191 --> 00:43:34,970
TV.

1468
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:37,070
A lot of producers call
it conflict reality,

1469
00:43:37,071 --> 00:43:40,550
which is not not a
place I ever want to be,

1470
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:42,440
which sucks because
that's where TV's moving.

1471
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,670
Like that's where the jobs are,

1472
00:43:43,671 --> 00:43:44,660
but I won't do it.

1473
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:45,523
You know what I mean?

1474
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,793
I don't see,

1475
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,451
oh come on.

1476
00:43:47,451 --> 00:43:49,480
Like all the most popular,

1477
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:50,990
highest rated shows are like that.

1478
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,010
It's just a trend.

1479
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:52,840
I really believe,

1480
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,260
but it's trending down,

1481
00:43:54,261 --> 00:43:54,681
you know what I mean?

1482
00:43:54,681 --> 00:43:57,740
Don't you feel like we are well on our
way to idiocracy like you watch that

1483
00:43:57,741 --> 00:44:02,180
movie and they're literally watching
a show called ouch my balls.

1484
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:04,820
Like the whole movie they're
watching out for my balls or,

1485
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:05,421
yeah.

1486
00:44:05,421 --> 00:44:08,120
How my balls or something where they
just follow each other around and like

1487
00:44:08,121 --> 00:44:09,560
punch each other in the
balls and then the people,

1488
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:11,000
oh that's hilarious.

1489
00:44:11,001 --> 00:44:13,100
As punching him in the
balls and it's like,

1490
00:44:13,101 --> 00:44:14,310
wasn't that jacket like,

1491
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,400
isn't that what we're watching now?

1492
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:17,630
Like that's so fucking,

1493
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:18,560
you know,

1494
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,240
speaking of the UK and TV,

1495
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:21,290
have you seen this show?

1496
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:22,520
Black Mirror?

1497
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:23,380
Have heard of it?

1498
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:23,620
It's,

1499
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,141
I've not seen it,

1500
00:44:24,141 --> 00:44:25,310
but I've heard it's so fucking good.

1501
00:44:25,311 --> 00:44:26,900
And I'm super depressed
because I watched it.

1502
00:44:26,901 --> 00:44:30,020
I like binge watch it all in a weekend
and then realize that it was an

1503
00:44:30,021 --> 00:44:30,471
anthology,

1504
00:44:30,471 --> 00:44:34,800
but they only made three in like 2011
and like three in 2013 so it's done.

1505
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:36,360
Like there was only six episodes ever,

1506
00:44:36,361 --> 00:44:37,320
which is super depressing.

1507
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:39,690
So those of you at home who
want to watch this like morning,

1508
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,710
there's only six episodes.

1509
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:41,544
So make them laugh.

1510
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,260
It's you.

1511
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:42,781
It's like a,

1512
00:44:42,781 --> 00:44:44,580
it's like a modern day twilight zone.

1513
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:45,600
It's really well done.

1514
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:46,800
It's super dark.

1515
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,940
But one of the really
interesting components about
it is that it has this sort

1516
00:44:50,941 --> 00:44:55,170
of Dystopian a technology angle,

1517
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:55,501
right?

1518
00:44:55,501 --> 00:44:56,221
It's like future,

1519
00:44:56,221 --> 00:44:57,570
but not too far in the future.

1520
00:44:57,571 --> 00:44:58,500
So as you're watching it,

1521
00:44:58,501 --> 00:44:59,340
it's very relatable.

1522
00:44:59,341 --> 00:45:01,080
Like they use technology really smartly,

1523
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:03,750
but just like we are,

1524
00:45:03,751 --> 00:45:04,081
you know,

1525
00:45:04,081 --> 00:45:07,380
just like I was talking
about this idea of um,

1526
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:08,431
ouch,

1527
00:45:08,431 --> 00:45:10,530
my balls being the way
that television is going.

1528
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,730
You watch this,

1529
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:15,630
the show and they're all on their phones.

1530
00:45:15,631 --> 00:45:16,321
They have these,

1531
00:45:16,321 --> 00:45:16,831
you know,

1532
00:45:16,831 --> 00:45:19,070
these implants in their
heads are in their ear.

1533
00:45:19,071 --> 00:45:19,320
They're,

1534
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:24,320
each episode is different but it's like
so believable and so sad that this could

1535
00:45:25,591 --> 00:45:29,430
potentially be the direction
that our culture is going.

1536
00:45:29,431 --> 00:45:29,831
Because I,

1537
00:45:29,831 --> 00:45:32,400
I mean now I'm driving,

1538
00:45:32,401 --> 00:45:33,420
you know I was just driving here,

1539
00:45:33,421 --> 00:45:36,120
which is a kind of a hike from Hollywood.

1540
00:45:36,121 --> 00:45:38,670
So I'm on the freeway like for quite
a long time and I'm looking at,

1541
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:42,180
there's a little bit of traffic so when
we're stopped I'm looking into cars or

1542
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:43,620
especially like city buses.

1543
00:45:43,621 --> 00:45:47,610
You look in the city buses and literally
every single person headphones in on

1544
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:47,940
their phone,

1545
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:51,870
like no interaction between other
people so dialed into their phones.

1546
00:45:51,871 --> 00:45:55,770
And what this show does really well is
take that component and like what happens

1547
00:45:55,771 --> 00:45:56,670
when we push it,

1548
00:45:56,671 --> 00:46:00,480
what happens when we go into the future
where nobody even cares about one

1549
00:46:00,481 --> 00:46:01,080
another anymore.

1550
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:05,400
And they just live in this like weird
digital world and their Avatar is who they

1551
00:46:05,401 --> 00:46:06,330
are and they,

1552
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:06,870
they,

1553
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:09,210
they spend all their money
like buying their Avatar,

1554
00:46:09,211 --> 00:46:10,170
a new hat or something.

1555
00:46:10,171 --> 00:46:13,230
Like they don't like the concept of
wearing a hat and life wouldn't make sense

1556
00:46:13,231 --> 00:46:15,840
because who gives a shit what you're
wearing because your avatar's wearing this

1557
00:46:15,841 --> 00:46:17,880
hat and all the avatars interactive,

1558
00:46:17,881 --> 00:46:18,990
but you don't interact with it.

1559
00:46:18,991 --> 00:46:23,550
It's like fascinating because there's a
fear that that's kind of the direction

1560
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,480
we're going

1561
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:30,890
as far as like that was a long
interesting rent as far as a television,

1562
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,750
like a television dumbing down
and becoming a part of idiocracy.

1563
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,740
I think one of the issues is the
delivery method of television.

1564
00:46:40,741 --> 00:46:43,680
The first place is massively
flawed because first of all,

1565
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:44,970
you're dealing with censorship,

1566
00:46:44,971 --> 00:46:45,540
censorship,

1567
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,040
huge fucks everything up.

1568
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:50,340
You're dealing with a gang
of people that you are,

1569
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:53,370
you're getting involved with that
don't want to offend anybody.

1570
00:46:53,371 --> 00:46:57,720
They want to make sure that you promote
whatever values that represent their

1571
00:46:57,721 --> 00:46:58,091
sponsor.

1572
00:46:58,091 --> 00:46:58,400
Yeah,

1573
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,330
it's all about the sponsor.

1574
00:46:59,331 --> 00:47:01,850
You're fundamentally behold into
your advertisers in television

1575
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:04,580
and then you have those advertisers to
consider cause there that's going to

1576
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:05,503
interact.

1577
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:07,280
The intersect into your program.

1578
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:07,821
Every,

1579
00:47:07,821 --> 00:47:08,121
you know,

1580
00:47:08,121 --> 00:47:09,080
x amount of minutes,

1581
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:09,950
boom,

1582
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:12,740
there's your show's gonna shut off
and then there's going to be dancing.

1583
00:47:12,741 --> 00:47:14,320
Fucking lizards are selling

1584
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:16,440
and that's the most
important thing to consider,

1585
00:47:16,441 --> 00:47:16,681
right?

1586
00:47:16,681 --> 00:47:18,600
Because if you can't get
the advertisers come in,

1587
00:47:18,601 --> 00:47:20,250
you can't get the budget to make the show,

1588
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,990
which means that you
can build an audience,

1589
00:47:21,991 --> 00:47:23,970
which means that you're not going
to get the ratings that you need,

1590
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,890
but fundamentally you've
got to keep the advertiser.

1591
00:47:26,891 --> 00:47:27,724
So you are,

1592
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:30,130
I think the bottom line for most is being

1593
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,480
beholden to those advertisers.

1594
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:35,860
Then you have something like Hbo that
produces something like game of Thrones

1595
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:38,110
and it becomes massively popular.

1596
00:47:38,111 --> 00:47:39,520
It's a brilliant show,

1597
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:40,930
incredibly well done.

1598
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:41,740
And then you say,

1599
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:41,951
oh,

1600
00:47:41,951 --> 00:47:42,551
wait a minute.

1601
00:47:42,551 --> 00:47:43,570
There's that too.

1602
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:45,880
But that is not being
represented the that,

1603
00:47:45,881 --> 00:47:46,320
that,

1604
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,140
that type of art form is
not being represented on
regular television because of

1605
00:47:50,141 --> 00:47:50,974
the restrictions.

1606
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,670
Because exactly the delivery
method is just so fucked up.

1607
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:55,331
That's,

1608
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:59,530
I think more of the issue than the
dumbing down of people because things like

1609
00:47:59,531 --> 00:48:03,040
podcasts are a perfect
example of why that's that.

1610
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:06,160
It's not the case that it's just
you're not reaching those people,

1611
00:48:06,161 --> 00:48:07,780
you're not stimulating those people.

1612
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:12,100
Like podcasts are reaching
more and more people every day.

1613
00:48:12,101 --> 00:48:14,590
And one of the reasons being is
that they're completely uncensored.

1614
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:15,401
And I still,

1615
00:48:15,401 --> 00:48:18,010
I mean this is my fear and I don't want
to be cynical and I don't want to be

1616
00:48:18,011 --> 00:48:18,401
negative,

1617
00:48:18,401 --> 00:48:19,330
but you take,

1618
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:23,680
you take the number of people that you
reach in a podcast and compare it to the

1619
00:48:23,681 --> 00:48:26,890
number of people tune in every
night to fucking two and a half men.

1620
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:32,020
And it's like depressing to see the
difference in the just sheer quantity of

1621
00:48:32,021 --> 00:48:32,771
people tuning in.

1622
00:48:32,771 --> 00:48:34,710
And I completely agree that the,

1623
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:37,660
the world of podcasts
and the world of HBO,

1624
00:48:37,661 --> 00:48:39,490
which is this beautiful kind of,

1625
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:40,300
you know,

1626
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,330
only subscription television said,

1627
00:48:42,331 --> 00:48:45,040
we don't give a shit
about the advertisers.

1628
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,360
The way that the HBO Model Right
is to higher production cut.

1629
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,240
Somebody pitches them a show,

1630
00:48:49,241 --> 00:48:49,931
they love the show.

1631
00:48:49,931 --> 00:48:51,460
The production company believes in it,

1632
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:53,050
they hire them and they're very hands off.

1633
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:53,471
They're like,

1634
00:48:53,471 --> 00:48:56,290
you sold us a show that you
thought would be brilliant.

1635
00:48:56,291 --> 00:48:57,101
We want to give you a chance,

1636
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,030
show us how brilliant it is.

1637
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,110
And it works.

1638
00:48:59,111 --> 00:48:59,321
I mean,

1639
00:48:59,321 --> 00:49:01,930
it very much works cause they don't get
in there and fuck everything up like

1640
00:49:01,931 --> 00:49:02,980
they do on most networks.

1641
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:03,880
Um,

1642
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:04,301
and yes,

1643
00:49:04,301 --> 00:49:07,570
there's a small portion of the
population who just eats that up.

1644
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,820
And I think that we are
probably those people.

1645
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:12,550
I think that your listeners are those
who I think everybody listening to the

1646
00:49:12,551 --> 00:49:13,121
show right now,

1647
00:49:13,121 --> 00:49:13,390
it's like,

1648
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:14,081
oh fuck yeah.

1649
00:49:14,081 --> 00:49:14,351
You know,

1650
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:17,950
I loved breaking bad or I've and breaking
that is actually a really interesting

1651
00:49:17,951 --> 00:49:20,530
example because it was
on cable television,

1652
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:23,500
walking dead used to be that example.

1653
00:49:23,501 --> 00:49:26,950
I think like the first season was
just absolutely amazing and brilliant.

1654
00:49:26,951 --> 00:49:30,160
And also on television with
commercials now it's kind of shit.

1655
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:30,821
I don't watch it.

1656
00:49:30,821 --> 00:49:31,654
So I don't know.

1657
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,190
I know that a lot of people still love it.

1658
00:49:33,191 --> 00:49:36,610
So I'm like a person in
a piece of relationship.

1659
00:49:36,611 --> 00:49:38,080
I'll still tune in when it comes back.

1660
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,150
I'm the same way with like,

1661
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,420
there's a handful of shows like that.

1662
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:41,620
I'm like that with girls.

1663
00:49:41,621 --> 00:49:43,540
I watched girls on Hbo
even though I'm like,

1664
00:49:43,541 --> 00:49:44,650
I don't even know if I like this.

1665
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:45,840
I'm going to keep watching.

1666
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,080
Yeah.

1667
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:50,860
I think the delivery method is just
what's really flawed and I think there's

1668
00:49:50,861 --> 00:49:51,461
also the,

1669
00:49:51,461 --> 00:49:54,340
the noninteractive
quality of of television.

1670
00:49:54,341 --> 00:49:59,070
We just sit there and the best you
can do is go on a blog somewhere and,

1671
00:49:59,071 --> 00:49:59,980
and you know and,

1672
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:00,940
and bitch about it.

1673
00:50:00,941 --> 00:50:01,411
But no,

1674
00:50:01,411 --> 00:50:02,730
I know it's like it we've got,

1675
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,650
I feel like the networks have to
understand that second screen viewing.

1676
00:50:05,651 --> 00:50:07,150
It's like the way of the future.

1677
00:50:07,151 --> 00:50:11,980
Like if if you want for television to
actually work because as we know it's sort

1678
00:50:11,981 --> 00:50:13,990
of dying and like the
web is really kind of,

1679
00:50:13,991 --> 00:50:15,340
I think picking up that slack.

1680
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:20,020
But if you do want to maintain a
function in the television sphere,

1681
00:50:20,021 --> 00:50:21,040
and this is where I work,

1682
00:50:21,041 --> 00:50:24,280
like obviously I want to maintain function
and the in the t v sphere even though

1683
00:50:24,281 --> 00:50:28,040
I'm perfectly happy to do a lot of cool
stuff and web two I have a lot of fun.

1684
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,510
I like to kind of bounce my time with it.

1685
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:32,270
You've got to understand how
to integrate those two things.

1686
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,820
You've got to understand
that most people nowadays,

1687
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,200
while we're watching TV,

1688
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:37,430
we're multitasking.

1689
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,480
It's very rare.

1690
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:41,030
There's a handful of shows
where like true detective now,

1691
00:50:41,031 --> 00:50:41,841
right on Hbo,

1692
00:50:41,841 --> 00:50:42,674
it's like the new,

1693
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,210
there's three episodes so far.

1694
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:46,100
When it's time to watch true detective,

1695
00:50:46,101 --> 00:50:49,210
I hit play on my DVR and I'm
like pissed if the phone rang,

1696
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:49,821
you know what I mean?

1697
00:50:49,821 --> 00:50:51,200
I'm like focused.

1698
00:50:51,201 --> 00:50:53,420
I'm not picking up my phone
and checking my email.

1699
00:50:53,421 --> 00:50:54,020
Every five set,

1700
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:54,980
I'm really focused,

1701
00:50:54,981 --> 00:50:57,410
but that's like one hour every week.

1702
00:50:57,411 --> 00:50:59,360
The rest of the time if
I am watching TV at all,

1703
00:50:59,361 --> 00:51:00,440
I'm on my phone,

1704
00:51:00,441 --> 00:51:02,120
I'm on my laptop doing work.

1705
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:06,140
I need to be able to do other
things at the same time.

1706
00:51:06,141 --> 00:51:10,370
And so if there's a way to have
the second screen functionality,

1707
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:15,350
I'm watching TV and then I have like
things on my TV or things on my phone that

1708
00:51:15,351 --> 00:51:17,450
will contribute to my experience.

1709
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:18,283
Watching this show,

1710
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:19,460
I'll engage in that.

1711
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:20,570
What do you mean by that?

1712
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,160
A show.

1713
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:22,830
Like what?

1714
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,070
How could you ever have that?

1715
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:24,621
So like,

1716
00:51:24,621 --> 00:51:25,181
let's say that you,

1717
00:51:25,181 --> 00:51:25,431
you know,

1718
00:51:25,431 --> 00:51:26,151
like my show,

1719
00:51:26,151 --> 00:51:27,110
I'm on,

1720
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:28,160
on pivot TV.

1721
00:51:28,161 --> 00:51:31,550
So I do a show called take part
live and it's nightly and it,

1722
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:32,390
um,

1723
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:35,810
up until yesterday actually we
were shooting it completely live.

1724
00:51:35,811 --> 00:51:37,190
So we're shooting at 9:00 PM,

1725
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:38,323
um,

1726
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:38,690
uh,

1727
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:39,650
on the west coast,

1728
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,910
midnight on the east coast.

1729
00:51:40,911 --> 00:51:43,400
And because of the live component,

1730
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:44,450
people can tweet us,

1731
00:51:44,451 --> 00:51:45,350
people can interact,

1732
00:51:45,351 --> 00:51:49,160
we have these panel discussions we can
like in real time like look at social

1733
00:51:49,161 --> 00:51:49,760
media and say,

1734
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:49,881
oh,

1735
00:51:49,881 --> 00:51:50,990
so and so was saying this,

1736
00:51:50,991 --> 00:51:52,370
like how do you respond to that?

1737
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:56,360
Which I think is really cool because
we're all living in a world now where like

1738
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:59,120
we want more customized entertainment,

1739
00:51:59,150 --> 00:51:59,601
you know what I mean?

1740
00:51:59,601 --> 00:52:00,590
Because it's capable.

1741
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:02,360
We have a capability for it now.

1742
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:06,700
And so I think watching TV and knowing
that TV is going to reflect the questions

1743
00:52:06,701 --> 00:52:08,600
that we have is really interesting.

1744
00:52:08,601 --> 00:52:09,740
And now we're shooting live to tape,

1745
00:52:09,741 --> 00:52:12,170
which I think even actually
allows more flexibility.

1746
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:13,970
So we shoot a little
bit earlier in the day.

1747
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:15,290
By the time it airs,

1748
00:52:15,291 --> 00:52:16,340
we've already shot it.

1749
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:19,580
But we can have sourced all
of this cool social component.

1750
00:52:19,581 --> 00:52:22,190
So like one of the things that we
do as a segment called viewers,

1751
00:52:22,191 --> 00:52:23,900
like you were uh,

1752
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:26,990
let's say you watch an episode and we
have this really great panel on like

1753
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:28,670
Autonomo Bay and then you know,

1754
00:52:28,671 --> 00:52:29,331
somebody who's watching,

1755
00:52:29,331 --> 00:52:32,750
it's like you never answered this one
question that's always bugged me about

1756
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:32,751
Guantanamo Bay.

1757
00:52:32,751 --> 00:52:33,950
So they like Skype in,

1758
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,350
they record a little question.

1759
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:39,710
Then we have the expert on the panel who
can answer that question directly and

1760
00:52:39,711 --> 00:52:40,730
we can pop it on the air.

1761
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:45,680
So just even baby steps like that I
think are really important when you're

1762
00:52:45,681 --> 00:52:46,640
watching TV.

1763
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:48,890
But I also think that
there's a way to do it wrong.

1764
00:52:48,891 --> 00:52:50,620
And I think that's what a lot of these,

1765
00:52:50,621 --> 00:52:53,900
I'm talking head like news networks
do like see it in an MSNBC,

1766
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,300
like it's not social interaction.

1767
00:52:56,301 --> 00:52:59,030
If you just have a Twitter ticker
on the bottom of the screen,

1768
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:01,880
that's like the laziest way noise.

1769
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,080
It's just noise.

1770
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:03,561
It's just,

1771
00:53:03,561 --> 00:53:05,180
there's like tickers everywhere.

1772
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:06,014
Sorry.

1773
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:07,490
There's tickers like everywhere.

1774
00:53:07,491 --> 00:53:07,881
And I just,

1775
00:53:07,881 --> 00:53:09,710
I can't even focus at that point.

1776
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,690
The ticker thing drives me fucking crazy.

1777
00:53:11,691 --> 00:53:13,610
They do that on sports shows,

1778
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:15,500
like if you're watching fights,

1779
00:53:15,501 --> 00:53:17,630
a lot of times like while
the fights are going on,

1780
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,400
there's a ticker underneath.

1781
00:53:19,401 --> 00:53:23,210
It's showing like football scores and
baseball scores and this car out cause

1782
00:53:23,211 --> 00:53:24,044
he's knees hurt.

1783
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:28,350
And then also like you've got
like a Joe Schmo number two says,

1784
00:53:28,351 --> 00:53:29,970
I can't believe he blew out his knee.

1785
00:53:29,971 --> 00:53:30,331
And you're like,

1786
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:31,370
I don't give a shit.

1787
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:34,253
I don't care.

1788
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:37,800
I think we're talking about completely
different genres because that wouldn't

1789
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:42,720
work with like a sitcom or that wouldn't
work with scripted entertainment.

1790
00:53:42,721 --> 00:53:45,570
It is a completely different arena and
that's an arena that I don't work in.

1791
00:53:45,571 --> 00:53:45,760
You know,

1792
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,310
I work in unscripted television,

1793
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:50,130
which is a totally different thing.

1794
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:53,880
I think that the problem with
scripted television right now is,

1795
00:53:53,881 --> 00:53:54,541
like you said,

1796
00:53:54,541 --> 00:53:56,400
if you are beholden to the advertisers,

1797
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:58,380
you're basically beholden to fear.

1798
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,300
And there is a bad habit,

1799
00:54:00,301 --> 00:54:04,410
I think in television right now where
a network executive wants the third,

1800
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:04,741
fourth,

1801
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,470
and fifth version of the same show.

1802
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:06,840
He said,

1803
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:06,991
oh,

1804
00:54:06,991 --> 00:54:07,350
that's,

1805
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:08,280
that worked one time.

1806
00:54:08,281 --> 00:54:08,941
Let's try it again.

1807
00:54:08,941 --> 00:54:09,511
Let's try it again.

1808
00:54:09,511 --> 00:54:13,050
And then they like run it into the ground
instead of we want something that's

1809
00:54:13,051 --> 00:54:17,460
new and innovative and out of step with
what we all see because this re it's too

1810
00:54:17,461 --> 00:54:19,310
expensive of a risk to take.

1811
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:20,730
If this show fails,

1812
00:54:20,731 --> 00:54:23,250
we're out millions of
dollars and it's just,

1813
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,060
it's not feasible for their network.

1814
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:29,280
So there's a lot of fear that comes
along with taking intense risks,

1815
00:54:29,281 --> 00:54:33,390
whereas HBO doesn't even
give a shit about any of it.

1816
00:54:33,391 --> 00:54:36,690
All they need to do is maintain their
subscriptions because they're much more

1817
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:38,370
interested in how they're received.

1818
00:54:38,371 --> 00:54:39,204
Critically.

1819
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:42,780
They would much rather
get 20 mes then get,

1820
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:43,380
you know,

1821
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,490
x amount of viewers.

1822
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,720
That doesn't matter to them.

1823
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,460
They have a set number of subscriptions,

1824
00:54:47,461 --> 00:54:48,900
they'd love it if subscriptions went up.

1825
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,440
But for the most part they understand
that only certain type of person is ever

1826
00:54:52,441 --> 00:54:53,550
going to be able to afford.

1827
00:54:53,551 --> 00:54:54,960
They've got already pay for cable,

1828
00:54:54,961 --> 00:54:58,770
they've got to be able to pay for
an expanded package and you know,

1829
00:54:58,771 --> 00:55:02,340
they know the stats on their
subscribers so they want to make quality

1830
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:02,941
television.

1831
00:55:02,941 --> 00:55:03,481
But like you said,

1832
00:55:03,481 --> 00:55:05,040
you're beholden to the advertisers.

1833
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,750
You're beholden to,

1834
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:07,351
you know,

1835
00:55:07,351 --> 00:55:10,380
network executives that are incredibly
afraid to lose their positions at their

1836
00:55:10,381 --> 00:55:13,140
jobs because they've got to bring numbers
into the network and they've got to

1837
00:55:13,141 --> 00:55:15,150
bring more advertising
money into the network.

1838
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:20,540
And that fear I think in some ways is
what fuels this fundamental dumbing down

1839
00:55:21,421 --> 00:55:22,230
of America.

1840
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:26,520
Because instead of saying we're going
to create content from an editorial

1841
00:55:26,521 --> 00:55:28,830
perspective that we think
would be beneficial,

1842
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:29,491
they say,

1843
00:55:29,491 --> 00:55:30,630
what do you want to see?

1844
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:32,310
And this is huge in the news arena.

1845
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:35,250
This is the real problem in
the news arena in America.

1846
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:38,310
Instead of saying this is
what's happening in the world,

1847
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:41,520
I'm giving you a platform so that you
can see what's happening in the world.

1848
00:55:41,521 --> 00:55:43,530
I've worked as a
journalist for many years,

1849
00:55:43,531 --> 00:55:46,410
so I have the editorial distinction
or discretion to be able to say,

1850
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:48,820
this is what's important
to share the news.

1851
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:49,171
People.

1852
00:55:49,171 --> 00:55:50,004
Now we're saying,

1853
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,690
what do you want us to talk about?

1854
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:53,340
What's interesting to you?

1855
00:55:53,341 --> 00:55:56,910
And then you end up having this
like negative feedback of like,

1856
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,830
shit going down the toilet.

1857
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,510
It's so dangerous.

1858
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:04,350
I was watching CNN headline
news and they had a poll.

1859
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,870
Who Do you think is a better person?

1860
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:12,000
Brittany Spears or Paris
Hilton was a fucking ball.

1861
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:12,540
It's insane.

1862
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:13,620
They broke in,

1863
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:19,550
they broke in on CNN m and an m s
fuck MSNBC when Bieber got arrested,

1864
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,100
like broke in to actual news.

1865
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:26,770
Give us this update because
it's so fucking important
that we know to the minute

1866
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,190
about Justin Bieber's arrest.

1867
00:56:29,191 --> 00:56:29,530
By the way,

1868
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:34,530
all the charges were dropped as a
complete nonissue wasn't drunk by the way,

1869
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:36,100
and he wasn't speeding.

1870
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:37,000
I have no idea.

1871
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:37,450
They just,

1872
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:39,970
there's just constant arrested
him because he's a crazy fuck.

1873
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:42,200
That's Florida also.

1874
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:45,370
You're dealing with a 19 year
old kid that has $100 billion.

1875
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:49,630
He's gonna go off the
rail around conversations.

1876
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:50,420
I think it's,

1877
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:55,150
it's more interesting that we talk about
income inequality in this country and

1878
00:56:55,151 --> 00:56:56,320
we talk about how,

1879
00:56:56,321 --> 00:56:56,560
you know,

1880
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:00,400
the sociology of having that kind of
responsibility and what it's like growing

1881
00:57:00,401 --> 00:57:01,240
up in the limelight.

1882
00:57:01,241 --> 00:57:02,530
When you put pressure on these people,

1883
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,830
it's a much less interesting
conversation to say,

1884
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:06,580
oh,

1885
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:07,061
meanwhile,

1886
00:57:07,061 --> 00:57:10,530
while I'm speaking to you about Syria
or while I'm talking about tensions that

1887
00:57:10,531 --> 00:57:12,100
are rising and Sochi around the law,

1888
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,320
whatever the fuck you know,

1889
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:14,620
talking about the state of the like,

1890
00:57:14,621 --> 00:57:15,580
can you imagine?

1891
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:16,540
And then breaking it.

1892
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:16,930
Oh,

1893
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:17,920
more on Bieber.

1894
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:21,160
Why believe the CNN one with MSNBC?

1895
00:57:21,161 --> 00:57:22,630
I think they were talking about the NSA.

1896
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:23,973
Oh my God.

1897
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:24,780
Hilarious.

1898
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:25,750
That the broken,

1899
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:27,880
the ultimate distraction.

1900
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:30,070
Seriously little hairless boy.

1901
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:31,210
And that's the thing that's like,

1902
00:57:31,211 --> 00:57:36,211
so it's so funny that I feel like anybody
who was alive in the 50s who is still

1903
00:57:36,851 --> 00:57:37,810
alive to this day,

1904
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:41,800
who was reading the Scifi
authors that I now love,

1905
00:57:41,801 --> 00:57:43,750
like Vonnegut and Orwell and,

1906
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:44,584
and they,

1907
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:47,200
they were warned about
this dystopian future.

1908
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,090
How many of those things are just
coming to fruition all the time.

1909
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:51,730
You know,

1910
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:53,110
this big brother mentality,

1911
00:57:53,111 --> 00:57:54,100
this like fundamental,

1912
00:57:54,101 --> 00:57:58,810
we're going to keep you distracted and
keep you lazy and try and eliminate any

1913
00:57:58,811 --> 00:58:00,940
sort of ability for massive revolution.

1914
00:58:00,941 --> 00:58:01,540
It's like,

1915
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,280
it's just so scary.

1916
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:05,200
I don't think so.

1917
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:06,640
I don't think your actions are engineers.

1918
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:09,790
I don't think that there's
some mass conspiracy that
there's like five people at

1919
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:12,070
the top with like nefarious mustaches.

1920
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:12,371
You know,

1921
00:58:12,371 --> 00:58:15,190
saying this is how we're
going to control everybody.

1922
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:17,440
But I do think that what
happens is that money,

1923
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:20,890
money comes into it and power comes
into it and people desperately,

1924
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,160
people with money and power
desperately don't want to lose it.

1925
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:27,100
People who don't have money or
power desperately want to gain it.

1926
00:58:27,101 --> 00:58:32,101
And so the system is really fixed in a
fucked up way where egalitarian values

1927
00:58:32,951 --> 00:58:36,850
and socialist values are not respected
in this country because you know,

1928
00:58:36,851 --> 00:58:37,690
you see it all the time.

1929
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:42,690
People voting against their own interests
because not because they fundamentally

1930
00:58:42,881 --> 00:58:43,840
believe that,

1931
00:58:43,841 --> 00:58:44,140
you know,

1932
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:47,800
this fat cat politician who's trying to
pass policy that keeps the little guy

1933
00:58:47,801 --> 00:58:52,090
down in that like really intensifies
the income inequality in this country.

1934
00:58:52,091 --> 00:58:52,631
They don't believe,

1935
00:58:52,631 --> 00:58:52,781
oh,

1936
00:58:52,781 --> 00:58:55,390
that's like morally the way we should go.

1937
00:58:55,391 --> 00:58:55,871
They believe,

1938
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,081
well,

1939
00:58:56,081 --> 00:58:59,500
one day I'm going to be rich and I want
to make sure that the laws protect me.

1940
00:58:59,680 --> 00:58:59,931
It's,

1941
00:58:59,931 --> 00:59:03,070
it's horrible and I think that the one
thing that maybe we can say is more

1942
00:59:03,071 --> 00:59:06,370
engineered than other is this
concept of the American dream.

1943
00:59:06,371 --> 00:59:10,330
This really fucked up concept
and it don't get me wrong,

1944
00:59:10,331 --> 00:59:11,380
it happens for some people.

1945
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:14,260
There are rags to riches stories
out there and they're great,

1946
00:59:14,261 --> 00:59:16,960
but they shouldn't be a template
for all of us to live our lives by.

1947
00:59:16,961 --> 00:59:17,980
We shouldn't all be like,

1948
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:19,090
you know,

1949
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:22,550
hoping and praying that one day we're
going strike it rich and we're going to go

1950
00:59:22,551 --> 00:59:23,030
from,

1951
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:23,301
you know,

1952
00:59:23,301 --> 00:59:24,350
this place to that place.

1953
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:25,720
It should be much more piecemeal.

1954
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:27,860
We should be living in a country where,

1955
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:29,083
where it's,

1956
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:33,140
it's plausible that you can work really
hard in your life and you can actually

1957
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:33,620
make a,

1958
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:36,230
make a life for yourself and
maybe get out of a shit situation,

1959
00:59:36,231 --> 00:59:37,880
getting a slightly better situation.

1960
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:41,180
I think that that's a real goal
and it should be a reasonable goal.

1961
00:59:41,181 --> 00:59:42,170
But in this country,

1962
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:45,230
it's getting to the point where it's
very hard to climb that social ladder.

1963
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:51,310
And I think a lot of it comes from this
idea of like keeping up this narrative,

1964
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:53,210
this rags to riches,

1965
00:59:53,211 --> 00:59:54,740
American dream narrative,

1966
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:59,030
the kinds of policies
that are put into place.

1967
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:04,060
Because that narrative is
what fundamentally underlies
everybody in America is

1968
01:00:04,941 --> 01:00:05,990
really dangerous.

1969
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:06,831
It's a really,

1970
01:00:06,831 --> 01:00:08,240
really dangerous point of view.

1971
01:00:08,241 --> 01:00:12,500
And it's something that I think that
has gotten worse in recent years.

1972
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:13,890
How do you think it's dangerous?

1973
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:17,090
So you don't want what makes you feel
like it's a dangerous idea to think that

1974
01:00:17,091 --> 01:00:21,260
you could pull yourself up from poverty
and become a wealthy person and,

1975
01:00:21,261 --> 01:00:21,530
uh,

1976
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:22,220
this,

1977
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:23,900
this anti socialism,

1978
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:24,823
uh,

1979
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,170
ideal that we,

1980
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,033
we sort of,

1981
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:27,750
uh,

1982
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:31,700
you find a lot of people
that are vehemently opposed
to the idea of socialism.

1983
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:35,300
I think a root of that is in laziness.

1984
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:38,810
I think a lot of people believe
that socialism enforces laziness.

1985
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,280
And I don't even think
it's about laziness.

1986
01:00:40,281 --> 01:00:43,700
I think I personally think a
root of that comes from racism,

1987
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:44,923
racism,

1988
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:45,771
intolerance.

1989
01:00:45,771 --> 01:00:47,540
And I think that religion is a,

1990
01:00:47,541 --> 01:00:49,580
is an easy tool for people to use to,

1991
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:51,680
to perpetuate these kinds of ideals.

1992
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:56,681
Because I think what happens is that when
most people who are wealthy were born

1993
01:00:57,831 --> 01:00:58,580
wealthy,

1994
01:00:58,580 --> 01:00:59,750
that's just the case.

1995
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:00,740
There is a real true,

1996
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:01,903
very much true.

1997
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:03,290
Most people who are,

1998
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:06,770
who are wealthy came from wealth there
because social mobility in this country

1999
01:01:06,771 --> 01:01:08,060
is worse than in most countries.

2000
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:09,740
And it's worse than it's
ever been in the past.

2001
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:10,671
So it's,

2002
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:11,900
it's very difficult.

2003
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:12,111
I mean,

2004
01:01:12,111 --> 01:01:13,190
if you look at the data,

2005
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:13,911
if you look at,

2006
01:01:13,911 --> 01:01:14,690
um,

2007
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:15,290
uh,

2008
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:15,861
evidence,

2009
01:01:15,861 --> 01:01:20,840
it's very difficult to move up in social
class in any sort of real meaningful

2010
01:01:20,841 --> 01:01:21,320
way.

2011
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:21,580
They're,

2012
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:22,413
they're definitely,

2013
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:23,460
there are,

2014
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:24,261
are piecemeal,

2015
01:01:24,261 --> 01:01:24,741
like I said,

2016
01:01:24,741 --> 01:01:26,960
like stepwise elevations that do occur.

2017
01:01:26,961 --> 01:01:27,530
But,

2018
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:27,980
um,

2019
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:29,600
if you read anything by Robert Reich,

2020
01:01:29,601 --> 01:01:30,320
if you look at,

2021
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:30,561
I mean,

2022
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:32,180
listened to Obama's state
of the Union address,

2023
01:01:32,181 --> 01:01:33,260
it's going to happen to night.

2024
01:01:33,261 --> 01:01:35,390
That's what he's going to talk
about is this growing rift,

2025
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:38,090
this growing income
inequality and how the,

2026
01:01:38,091 --> 01:01:40,880
the rift between rich and poor has
gotten worse and worse and worse.

2027
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:44,780
And so I think what fundamentally
happens is that if you're born poor,

2028
01:01:44,781 --> 01:01:46,880
you're very likely to be poor in life.

2029
01:01:46,881 --> 01:01:48,740
That it's not to say that you have to be,

2030
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:52,460
but you're very likely for your kids
to be poor and those kids to be poor.

2031
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:53,600
If you're born rich,

2032
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:56,360
you're more likely to be able to
maintain some level of wealth.

2033
01:01:56,660 --> 01:02:00,500
And I think what happens is that the
wealthy people who have the money and and

2034
01:02:00,501 --> 01:02:03,860
fundamentally have the political power
because they have the money and the

2035
01:02:03,861 --> 01:02:08,330
social power in many ways have this
like really bad sense of entitlement.

2036
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:09,081
Well,

2037
01:02:09,081 --> 01:02:13,340
we must have been somehow better
because if we have more money,

2038
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:17,480
there's some sort of connection
between money and more reality.

2039
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:22,170
There's some sort of connection between
money and some sort of positive valence.

2040
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:26,820
So if I have more money and I must be
better than people who are less fortunate

2041
01:02:26,821 --> 01:02:29,490
than I must've done
something to deserve that.

2042
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,700
There must be a reason that people who
live in poverty live in poverty and

2043
01:02:32,701 --> 01:02:37,701
that's where you get these horribly
regressive social policies like that.

2044
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:43,660
That asshole in Florida who was trying
to pass a law requiring people who are on

2045
01:02:44,311 --> 01:02:45,990
welfare to all be drug test.

2046
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:49,350
It's just like blanket drug tests for
people too who are on welfare to continue

2047
01:02:49,351 --> 01:02:52,260
to receive their government assistance.

2048
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,051
Things where,

2049
01:02:53,051 --> 01:02:56,310
where there's this fundamental fear of
government assistance and of welfare

2050
01:02:56,550 --> 01:02:57,383
when,

2051
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:58,321
you know,

2052
01:02:58,321 --> 01:02:59,820
we know that we give more welfare,

2053
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:00,690
uh,

2054
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:02,760
to corporations and we even do to people,

2055
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:03,061
right?

2056
01:03:03,061 --> 01:03:07,440
We know that a large majority of people
who are on welfare at this point are

2057
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:11,610
people who work full time and
people who are supporting families,

2058
01:03:11,611 --> 01:03:13,590
people who are not fucking lazy.

2059
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:17,160
There's like this fear that there's
some sort of like social leaching of the

2060
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:18,400
system that there's this like,

2061
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:20,490
I think there's a lot of racism in a,

2062
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:20,851
you know,

2063
01:03:20,851 --> 01:03:21,171
there's the,

2064
01:03:21,171 --> 01:03:21,660
you know,

2065
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:26,250
poor black single mothers who don't
know any better and their welfare queen,

2066
01:03:26,251 --> 01:03:26,461
you know,

2067
01:03:26,461 --> 01:03:31,461
there's these terms that are really like
invented by policymakers on the right,

2068
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:32,070
uh,

2069
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:36,600
by be like big PR machines like
welfare queens and things like that.

2070
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:41,600
When the statistics show us over and
over that that's the tiniest fraction of

2071
01:03:41,791 --> 01:03:42,780
our population.

2072
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:43,830
And that the massive,

2073
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:44,580
uh,

2074
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:48,720
the majority of people who actually
receive welfare throughout their lives use

2075
01:03:48,721 --> 01:03:52,500
it as a stepping stone to be able to
get off of welfare and that it actually

2076
01:03:52,501 --> 01:03:54,810
ends up saving the entire
country a lot of money.

2077
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:55,861
And so,

2078
01:03:55,861 --> 01:03:56,371
I mean,

2079
01:03:56,371 --> 01:04:01,260
I feel very strongly that this
rift comes from entitlement,

2080
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:02,280
that this,

2081
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,440
this idea of like if I'm rich,

2082
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:08,310
it must be because I'm better in
some way is a really dangerous idea.

2083
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:10,830
And that's where like you were asking,

2084
01:04:10,831 --> 01:04:12,090
why do I think it's dangerous?

2085
01:04:12,091 --> 01:04:13,320
I think that's where it comes from.

2086
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:18,120
One thing for a lot of people becoming
rich or getting to a position where

2087
01:04:18,121 --> 01:04:20,250
you're wealthy is a competition.

2088
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:22,260
Once they've achieved that,

2089
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:22,860
they,

2090
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:23,240
uh,

2091
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:23,520
they,

2092
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,600
they want to say,

2093
01:04:24,601 --> 01:04:24,961
look,

2094
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:25,794
I've won.

2095
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,750
And there's that old expression,

2096
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,460
people that were born on third base,

2097
01:04:29,461 --> 01:04:32,280
but they think they hit
a triple and that's like,

2098
01:04:32,281 --> 01:04:32,551
look,

2099
01:04:32,551 --> 01:04:32,830
look,

2100
01:04:32,830 --> 01:04:33,480
I've won.

2101
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,030
Like,

2102
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:34,863
but how many,

2103
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,240
how many of those people?

2104
01:04:36,241 --> 01:04:36,451
Yeah,

2105
01:04:36,451 --> 01:04:36,871
exactly.

2106
01:04:36,871 --> 01:04:37,800
Really did win.

2107
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:38,663
Like I,

2108
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:39,503
I,

2109
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:45,240
I would be blown away if somebody could
show me a high statistic of individuals

2110
01:04:45,241 --> 01:04:50,190
who actually started off in an
impoverished position and became wealthy.

2111
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:51,090
Now there is a,

2112
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:53,760
there are a fair amount of people
who really have pulled them out,

2113
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,610
pull themselves up from their
bootstraps and gotten an education.

2114
01:04:56,611 --> 01:04:58,020
And most of the time,

2115
01:04:58,021 --> 01:05:00,960
the reason that that's happened is
because they've made use of public,

2116
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:01,200
uh,

2117
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,700
assistance that's been available.

2118
01:05:02,701 --> 01:05:05,790
They've been able to use a federal
grants that have helped them get through

2119
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:07,050
school for whatever reason.

2120
01:05:07,051 --> 01:05:10,470
If you come from an
impoverished neighborhood and
you use education as a way

2121
01:05:10,471 --> 01:05:10,771
out,

2122
01:05:10,771 --> 01:05:11,041
right,

2123
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:11,730
and you,

2124
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:12,880
you do your Undergrad,

2125
01:05:12,881 --> 01:05:14,070
you do your graduate training,

2126
01:05:14,071 --> 01:05:17,230
you're able to get the funding that you
need to basically get the education to

2127
01:05:17,231 --> 01:05:18,580
be able to get a really good job.

2128
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:20,080
That's one way that people get out,

2129
01:05:20,081 --> 01:05:21,910
but these people aren't rich afterward.

2130
01:05:21,911 --> 01:05:22,780
They're comfortable.

2131
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:25,630
There's a big difference between
moving from lower class to moving from

2132
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:26,410
middleclass.

2133
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:26,921
But as we know,

2134
01:05:26,921 --> 01:05:28,600
the middle class in this
country is shrinking.

2135
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:31,360
The majority of people who
I think would probably say,

2136
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:31,781
well,

2137
01:05:31,781 --> 01:05:32,170
I didn't,

2138
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:35,050
I came from modest means
and now I'm wealthy.

2139
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:37,060
They probably didn't
come from modest means.

2140
01:05:37,090 --> 01:05:38,560
They're probably white already.

2141
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:39,790
They probably had,

2142
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:40,540
uh,

2143
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:43,570
two parents at home who
were really helping them.

2144
01:05:43,571 --> 01:05:43,811
You know,

2145
01:05:43,811 --> 01:05:48,190
mom was there and could make it easier
for this kid to maybe not have to have a

2146
01:05:48,191 --> 01:05:49,540
job when they were in high school,

2147
01:05:49,541 --> 01:05:54,520
maybe not have to deal with a lot of
the things that real poverty is not just

2148
01:05:54,521 --> 01:05:55,690
about not having money.

2149
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:59,920
It's about all sorts of socioeconomic
problems that come along with poverty.

2150
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,580
And so I think even growing
up middle class at this point,

2151
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:06,520
we need to fundamentally
understand that that's a privilege.

2152
01:06:06,850 --> 01:06:07,421
You know what I mean?

2153
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:09,010
I grew up in the middle class.

2154
01:06:09,011 --> 01:06:12,370
I grew up in a suburb of
Dallas and it was comfortable.

2155
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:16,120
I grew up in a single parent home for
the most part because my parents got

2156
01:06:16,121 --> 01:06:17,260
divorced when I was like seven,

2157
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:18,460
but we were fine.

2158
01:06:18,461 --> 01:06:19,720
My mom worked three jobs.

2159
01:06:19,721 --> 01:06:22,150
I gave money to my mom when
I worked in high school.

2160
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:23,111
You know,

2161
01:06:23,111 --> 01:06:24,040
she did need that.

2162
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:24,821
We did need that.

2163
01:06:24,821 --> 01:06:27,970
But I had it so much better
off than a lot of other people.

2164
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:33,300
And I know that about myself and I don't
want to ever forget that because I'm in

2165
01:06:34,391 --> 01:06:35,860
a comfortable position now,

2166
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:38,740
but I didn't start impoverished.

2167
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:42,880
And I think that that is what made it
easier for me to be in a comfortable

2168
01:06:42,881 --> 01:06:43,361
position.

2169
01:06:43,361 --> 01:06:44,194
Now

2170
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,530
that sounds impoverished.

2171
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:47,260
I mean it sounds poor like you,

2172
01:06:47,261 --> 01:06:49,430
you had to give money to your mom
when you were working at high school,

2173
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:50,520
but I don't think we have four.

2174
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:53,700
I think that if you actually look at
what the poverty line is in this country,

2175
01:06:53,701 --> 01:06:54,930
I don't think we would've qualified

2176
01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:56,970
because of your contributions.

2177
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,920
But if it was just based on your mother,

2178
01:06:59,010 --> 01:06:59,880
she worked three jobs.

2179
01:06:59,881 --> 01:07:00,511
She was hardworking.

2180
01:07:00,511 --> 01:07:01,620
She was an amazing mom.

2181
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:02,790
And I think that probably,

2182
01:07:02,791 --> 01:07:03,141
I mean the,

2183
01:07:03,141 --> 01:07:04,740
the poverty line is very low.

2184
01:07:04,830 --> 01:07:07,470
If you really think about where
you have to be to qualify,

2185
01:07:07,471 --> 01:07:08,071
for example,

2186
01:07:08,071 --> 01:07:09,570
for assistance with Obamacare,

2187
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:10,740
like to be able to,

2188
01:07:10,741 --> 01:07:11,370
uh,

2189
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:12,750
qualify with assistance on the,

2190
01:07:12,751 --> 01:07:14,040
on the insurance trades or to,

2191
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:17,190
to be able to qualify for certain
government programs like it's low.

2192
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:18,650
You have to make very little money.

2193
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:19,800
There's a lot of issues.

2194
01:07:19,801 --> 01:07:20,251
I mean this,

2195
01:07:20,251 --> 01:07:24,150
a lot of what we talked about earlier
when we were talking about the variables

2196
01:07:24,151 --> 01:07:27,270
that go into creating
a human being that's,

2197
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:32,310
that plays a part in who is your parents?

2198
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:34,560
Where did you grow up?

2199
01:07:34,561 --> 01:07:36,810
What is the environment
that you're forced to be in?

2200
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,930
And the,

2201
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:43,410
the difference between welfare
and subsidies is it's entirely,

2202
01:07:43,411 --> 01:07:44,370
and how we view it.

2203
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:44,910
You know,

2204
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:48,450
we've used subsidies as being an
important part of maintaining business,

2205
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:49,950
whereas essentially that's a,

2206
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:50,340
um,

2207
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:54,660
a much more expensive form of welfare
that cost tax payers way more and

2208
01:07:54,661 --> 01:07:56,400
oftentimes has dubious results.

2209
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:57,030
Exactly.

2210
01:07:57,030 --> 01:08:00,540
Like when it comes to like
down at subsidizing corn
and then you find out about

2211
01:08:00,541 --> 01:08:05,541
the fucking high fructose corn
syrup and it's enforcing everything.

2212
01:08:05,971 --> 01:08:06,211
Yeah.

2213
01:08:06,211 --> 01:08:06,321
Like,

2214
01:08:06,321 --> 01:08:06,631
wait a minute,

2215
01:08:06,631 --> 01:08:07,020
wait a moment.

2216
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:08,250
Where did they're paying money.

2217
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,560
Tax money goes to that.

2218
01:08:10,561 --> 01:08:11,700
Like this is a weird thing.

2219
01:08:11,701 --> 01:08:12,391
While the farmers,

2220
01:08:12,391 --> 01:08:17,030
the farmers are getting
help out Sorda Kinda

2221
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:18,170
but look what's going on.

2222
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:19,620
We'll look what's really going on.

2223
01:08:19,621 --> 01:08:20,770
Cost more to produce that.

2224
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,260
I'm not a fan of giving people money.

2225
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:24,830
Um,

2226
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:27,680
in order to make sure that they,

2227
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:28,450
uh,

2228
01:08:28,450 --> 01:08:29,283
you know,

2229
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:32,240
they do things like,

2230
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:32,630
I,

2231
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:32,931
I don't,

2232
01:08:32,931 --> 01:08:36,230
I don't think you can give people money
and make sure that they do drug tests.

2233
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:39,320
I don't think you can do ma give
people money and make sure that they,

2234
01:08:39,321 --> 01:08:39,800
uh,

2235
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:43,070
are forced to apply to x
amount of jobs per month.

2236
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:48,280
I think all of that time and energy
that's spent enforcing that is probably,

2237
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:53,620
it's probably just going to create this
sort of authoritarian environment that

2238
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:56,780
people are only going to count for
something like three to 5% of those people

2239
01:08:56,781 --> 01:08:57,080
anyway.

2240
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,270
That you're really like
obsessing over whether or not,

2241
01:08:59,271 --> 01:09:00,410
because the vast majority of people,

2242
01:09:00,411 --> 01:09:00,891
for example,

2243
01:09:00,891 --> 01:09:03,680
on unemployment don't want to fucking
live their lives on unemployment.

2244
01:09:03,850 --> 01:09:04,683
The vast,

2245
01:09:04,830 --> 01:09:05,900
whew,

2246
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:08,090
I'm rolling in my unemployment.

2247
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:08,571
They're like,

2248
01:09:08,571 --> 01:09:09,081
fuck,

2249
01:09:09,081 --> 01:09:09,920
this sucks,

2250
01:09:09,921 --> 01:09:11,180
but I can't find a job.

2251
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:12,980
And especially in California,

2252
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:14,330
if we collect unemployment,

2253
01:09:14,331 --> 01:09:16,040
we fucking paid into it.

2254
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:17,240
It's our money.

2255
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:18,071
We earned it.

2256
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:20,540
And that's something that I think we have
to understand about the tax structure

2257
01:09:20,541 --> 01:09:24,740
to when you spend your entire
life paying into taxes,

2258
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:27,500
there are social programs
that those taxes fund.

2259
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:30,560
And so when you fall on hard times,

2260
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:33,200
what that safety net is
supposed to be there for,

2261
01:09:33,201 --> 01:09:35,300
you've been paying into
it your entire life.

2262
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:36,800
I have a question for you.

2263
01:09:36,801 --> 01:09:38,570
I want to know what you
think about this recent,

2264
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,433
um,

2265
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:42,180
this recent article that I,

2266
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:44,990
that I read and we covered
on my show in Utah,

2267
01:09:44,991 --> 01:09:47,060
which is a very conservative state,

2268
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:47,631
right?

2269
01:09:47,631 --> 01:09:47,750
It's,

2270
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,690
it's totally like
overtly republican state.

2271
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:55,670
They are solving the homelessness crisis
and the way that they've decided to do

2272
01:09:55,671 --> 01:09:57,950
it is completely evidence based.

2273
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:58,731
And so for me,

2274
01:09:58,731 --> 01:10:01,760
I look at this story and I think of it
much more in scientific terms and in

2275
01:10:01,761 --> 01:10:02,391
moral terms,

2276
01:10:02,391 --> 01:10:03,740
but I want to know what
you think about it.

2277
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:08,660
So they looked at the average homeless
person in their state and they realize

2278
01:10:08,661 --> 01:10:10,760
that in terms of um,

2279
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:13,700
medical treatment and uh,

2280
01:10:13,730 --> 01:10:18,730
social services that the average homeless
person was costing the states $17,000

2281
01:10:18,771 --> 01:10:19,250
a year.

2282
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:21,380
They were $17,000 burden per person.

2283
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:26,030
And that if they put this person into
government housing and offered them a

2284
01:10:26,031 --> 01:10:26,990
social worker,

2285
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:29,570
it only cost $9,000 a year.

2286
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:35,350
And so no strings attached there taking
these individuals off the streets and

2287
01:10:35,811 --> 01:10:37,070
giving them apartments.

2288
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:41,120
Now they may check in
with their social worker,

2289
01:10:41,121 --> 01:10:42,470
they may fall off the grid,

2290
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:44,330
they may work on getting a job,

2291
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,730
they may resort to alcoholism,

2292
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:47,601
you don't know.

2293
01:10:47,601 --> 01:10:48,530
And no matter what,

2294
01:10:48,531 --> 01:10:51,050
they don't have any strings attached to
that apartment is theirs and they can

2295
01:10:51,051 --> 01:10:51,441
live there.

2296
01:10:51,441 --> 01:10:52,790
It's provided by the government.

2297
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:56,330
It's helping them clear the
homeless people off the street.

2298
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,180
But fundamentally when it
comes to a bottom line via,

2299
01:10:59,181 --> 01:11:02,390
which to me is a much more
conservative Republican viewpoint.

2300
01:11:02,570 --> 01:11:03,410
This is cheaper,

2301
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,120
this is saving the state money.

2302
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:07,370
Do you think that this is a good idea?

2303
01:11:07,670 --> 01:11:09,170
I definitely think that's a good idea.

2304
01:11:09,171 --> 01:11:13,230
I think also what's what's
really important when you're
dealing with the quote

2305
01:11:13,231 --> 01:11:13,980
unquote homeless

2306
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:17,280
people is to differentiate between
how many people have had bad luck,

2307
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,260
how many people grew
up in bad environments,

2308
01:11:19,261 --> 01:11:20,810
and how many people have
mental health problems.

2309
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:23,310
The vast majority of match part of it,

2310
01:11:23,311 --> 01:11:28,311
the Reagan administration changed the
standards for people being put into mental

2311
01:11:29,941 --> 01:11:33,150
health facilities and
they allow these people,

2312
01:11:33,151 --> 01:11:37,800
they were clearly ill to just fend for
themselves and a society that doesn't

2313
01:11:37,801 --> 01:11:41,040
take care of it's sick
is a society that's sick.

2314
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:41,761
That's so true.

2315
01:11:41,761 --> 01:11:42,031
I mean,

2316
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:42,864
yeah,

2317
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,660
I love that you bring that up because
even more than this issue like we're

2318
01:11:45,661 --> 01:11:45,871
talking,

2319
01:11:45,871 --> 01:11:46,501
which I agree.

2320
01:11:46,501 --> 01:11:47,370
I think the homelessness,

2321
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,590
the way that they're approaching
it in Utah's brilliant.

2322
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:51,930
I am a very progressive thinker,

2323
01:11:51,931 --> 01:11:54,660
but I think it's one of those interesting
things where conservative thinkers may

2324
01:11:54,661 --> 01:11:55,830
be on my team with this,

2325
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:57,090
but for different reasons.

2326
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:01,920
But fundamentally the fact that
healthcare is a for profit system in this

2327
01:12:01,921 --> 01:12:05,640
country I think is is so a moral,

2328
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:10,440
it's such a disgusting system because
it's built on a capitalist framework.

2329
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:15,710
And as much as I think that capitalism
has a very important place in modern

2330
01:12:15,841 --> 01:12:16,674
society,

2331
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:21,360
I don't think that capitalism
is a moral framework.

2332
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:21,870
I don't,

2333
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:24,990
I think that's why we need regulation
because I think that if it's all about

2334
01:12:24,991 --> 01:12:26,220
trying to make money,

2335
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:30,510
it's very easy for greed and like
really bad practices to come into play.

2336
01:12:30,511 --> 01:12:32,250
That's where people
get taken advantage of.

2337
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:33,570
That's why we need fucking,

2338
01:12:34,370 --> 01:12:34,680
you know,

2339
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:38,610
like meat regulation and it's like
read Upton Sinclair's the jungle.

2340
01:12:38,611 --> 01:12:42,060
Like it's very important that this
happens because if it's all about profit

2341
01:12:42,061 --> 01:12:43,140
motive and bottom line,

2342
01:12:43,141 --> 01:12:45,660
people are going to make
disgusting decisions and
they're not going to take care

2343
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:46,530
of the consumer.

2344
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,090
So what happens in a,

2345
01:12:48,091 --> 01:12:52,920
in a healthcare framework is that we
have a healthcare system that's a for

2346
01:12:52,921 --> 01:12:53,880
profit system.

2347
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:55,830
The more sick people there are,

2348
01:12:55,831 --> 01:12:57,600
the more money there is to be made.

2349
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,560
So there's absolutely no
incentive to help people get well.

2350
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:06,450
And there's also no incentive for people
to motivate their patients to seek

2351
01:13:06,451 --> 01:13:07,770
nonsurgical methods,

2352
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:09,780
nonsurgical to seek preventative method.

2353
01:13:09,781 --> 01:13:09,991
I mean,

2354
01:13:09,991 --> 01:13:11,130
at least with Obamacare,

2355
01:13:11,131 --> 01:13:13,380
even though there's like lots
of problems with this law,

2356
01:13:13,381 --> 01:13:16,410
even though I fully think that
if we had gone single payer,

2357
01:13:16,411 --> 01:13:18,450
it would have been a
significantly better system.

2358
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:19,860
At least now,

2359
01:13:20,190 --> 01:13:20,820
you know,

2360
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:22,680
I can get a pap for free.

2361
01:13:22,681 --> 01:13:23,161
I can,

2362
01:13:23,161 --> 01:13:23,611
you know,

2363
01:13:23,611 --> 01:13:24,444
I can,

2364
01:13:25,330 --> 01:13:25,920
yeah,

2365
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:26,753
sorry guys.

2366
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:28,260
And,

2367
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:29,700
and you might be able to,

2368
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:30,331
you know,

2369
01:13:30,331 --> 01:13:35,331
get a prostate exam for free and their
spoon and how much cheaper is it for the

2370
01:13:37,141 --> 01:13:42,060
state to subsidize or this or the
country to subsidize preventative,

2371
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:42,481
uh,

2372
01:13:42,481 --> 01:13:44,010
actually preventative as the right word.

2373
01:13:44,011 --> 01:13:46,150
Preventative is not a word that's not,

2374
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:46,530
no,

2375
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:47,363
isn't that crazy?

2376
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:49,400
If you look it up in the dictionary,

2377
01:13:49,401 --> 01:13:52,950
I'll say that like it's now become a
word because people use it so often.

2378
01:13:52,951 --> 01:13:55,260
But technically the
correct word is preventive,

2379
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:56,100
which isn't on,

2380
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:56,401
I know,

2381
01:13:56,401 --> 01:13:57,740
but it's so natural to prevention.

2382
01:13:58,090 --> 01:13:58,350
Yeah.

2383
01:13:58,350 --> 01:13:58,830
But read,

2384
01:13:58,830 --> 01:14:03,210
it'll say something like the
preventative preventative,

2385
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:09,240
like most of the dictionary definition
say that like however they word it,

2386
01:14:09,241 --> 01:14:11,770
but like over time it's
been used much to that.

2387
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,630
They've added it to the dictionary.

2388
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:14,271
It's one of those things.

2389
01:14:14,271 --> 01:14:15,130
Is Anything wrong with that?

2390
01:14:15,131 --> 01:14:16,810
Because all words are invented eventually.

2391
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:17,981
Originally rather.

2392
01:14:17,981 --> 01:14:18,100
Yeah,

2393
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:18,800
that's true.

2394
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:19,090
Um,

2395
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:19,923
but anyway,

2396
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:23,620
how much cheaper is it right for the
government to subsidize those kinds of

2397
01:14:23,621 --> 01:14:28,621
things versus intense
cancer treatment later on?

2398
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:29,951
So many things.

2399
01:14:29,951 --> 01:14:31,930
If they can be caught early
or going to be cheaper,

2400
01:14:31,931 --> 01:14:34,300
I can give you a personal story.

2401
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:39,330
I hurt my neck doing Jujitsu and I have
bulging disc in my neck and the bulging

2402
01:14:40,061 --> 01:14:44,950
disc was causing numbness in my
fingers and the Ulnar nerve was it.

2403
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:48,970
I was feeling pain in my elbow that
was going and I talked to doctors that

2404
01:14:48,971 --> 01:14:49,804
wanted to cut me.

2405
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,220
They wanted to do surgery.

2406
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:51,791
They were like,

2407
01:14:51,791 --> 01:14:52,320
you know this,

2408
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,680
this is the best way to deal with this.

2409
01:14:53,681 --> 01:14:54,514
We'll do surgery,

2410
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:55,211
we'll do,

2411
01:14:55,211 --> 01:14:56,530
we can give you an epidural,

2412
01:14:56,531 --> 01:14:57,820
which just numbs the pain.

2413
01:14:57,820 --> 01:14:58,150
You don't,

2414
01:14:58,150 --> 01:14:59,680
you don't feel the pain anymore.

2415
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:03,700
And then the other option is you go in
and they'll cut a piece of your disk off.

2416
01:15:03,850 --> 01:15:05,740
This was a year ago.

2417
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:11,500
I treated it completely non
nonsurgically with spinal decompression,

2418
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:12,310
rolfing,

2419
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:13,270
deep tissue massage.

2420
01:15:13,450 --> 01:15:14,800
The spinal decompression was big.

2421
01:15:14,801 --> 01:15:16,900
And then a recently a
thing called Regena keen,

2422
01:15:16,901 --> 01:15:21,901
which is something that was invented in
Germany where they take your blood and

2423
01:15:22,211 --> 01:15:24,960
they heat it and spin it in
a centrifuge and take out,

2424
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:25,660
uh,

2425
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:29,230
some aspects of the blood and then
reinjected into the area and it becomes a

2426
01:15:29,231 --> 01:15:31,360
very potent anti inflammatory medication.

2427
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:32,680
It's gone.

2428
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:33,310
Totally gone.

2429
01:15:33,310 --> 01:15:34,210
I had a new MRI,

2430
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:35,440
no bulging disc at all.

2431
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:35,891
No,

2432
01:15:35,891 --> 01:15:36,671
no symptoms,

2433
01:15:36,671 --> 01:15:37,421
no issues,

2434
01:15:37,421 --> 01:15:38,220
no issues with it.

2435
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:39,070
With exercise,

2436
01:15:39,730 --> 01:15:41,710
I could have gone through a
fucking surgery for nothing.

2437
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,480
We could have gotten my back cut open,

2438
01:15:43,481 --> 01:15:45,160
my pieces of my disc removed.

2439
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:47,200
And I think there's a real issue with,

2440
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:52,230
with doctors that are motivated
to automatically point
towards a surgical option

2441
01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:55,690
because surgical options are fucking
expensive and there's a huge profit motive

2442
01:15:55,691 --> 01:15:56,080
in them.

2443
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:56,913
Yeah,

2444
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,930
I mean for the most part it's just labor.

2445
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:00,190
All they're paying for his Labor,

2446
01:16:00,191 --> 01:16:00,550
maybe,

2447
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:03,910
maybe some medical device that
as we've seen over and over,

2448
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:05,800
the marketplace doesn't regulate at all.

2449
01:16:05,801 --> 01:16:10,801
So like some surgery in this town in
Colorado costs 10 times as much as the

2450
01:16:10,991 --> 01:16:14,590
surgery in this town in Vermont only
because their medical regulations there.

2451
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:15,280
It's,

2452
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,113
it's crazy.

2453
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:17,650
Like there's no bottom line at all.

2454
01:16:17,651 --> 01:16:17,821
It's,

2455
01:16:17,821 --> 01:16:19,660
it's pure profit for them to do surgery.

2456
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:24,130
I don't think there's anything wrong
with giving someone incentive to become a

2457
01:16:24,131 --> 01:16:25,570
really excellent surgeon.

2458
01:16:25,571 --> 01:16:29,950
And if a guy is an amazing surgeon and
because of the fact that he's the best in

2459
01:16:29,951 --> 01:16:30,491
the world,

2460
01:16:30,491 --> 01:16:33,820
he gets paid more and that
motivates him towards excellence.

2461
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:34,571
You should get paid more.

2462
01:16:34,571 --> 01:16:34,751
Yeah.

2463
01:16:34,751 --> 01:16:35,890
But it's weird.

2464
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:38,890
There's a weird gray
area there because it's,

2465
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:41,470
that's capitalism and
that's not the doctors that,

2466
01:16:41,471 --> 01:16:44,320
it's not the doctors' salaries that
are making all of this so expensive.

2467
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:44,651
It's,

2468
01:16:44,651 --> 01:16:47,950
it's the fucking profit motive at the
hospitals and the pharmaceutical companies

2469
01:16:47,951 --> 01:16:49,240
and the medical device companies.

2470
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:51,340
That's where all of the
money is coming from.

2471
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,790
I think that the way that we pay or we
probably still don't pay our doctors

2472
01:16:54,791 --> 01:16:55,090
enough.

2473
01:16:55,090 --> 01:16:58,420
If you think about how much they put
into medical school and how much they put

2474
01:16:58,421 --> 01:17:00,160
into professional liability insurance,

2475
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:03,880
I don't think that doctors are actually
walking around like super wealthy.

2476
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:04,061
Well,

2477
01:17:04,061 --> 01:17:04,661
some of them are,

2478
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:07,420
but the liability is also a huge
issue because then you're dealing with

2479
01:17:07,421 --> 01:17:09,470
predatory practices where
you're dealing with,

2480
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:10,160
there's

2481
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:14,540
people that absolutely did get fucked
over and their doctor screwed up and

2482
01:17:14,541 --> 01:17:14,691
their,

2483
01:17:14,691 --> 01:17:16,010
their lives have been changed.

2484
01:17:16,011 --> 01:17:21,011
Like I read about some woman yesterday
who was an opera singer who gave birth

2485
01:17:21,171 --> 01:17:22,670
and they ruined the,

2486
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:22,941
you know,

2487
01:17:22,941 --> 01:17:23,300
the,

2488
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:27,890
the wall between the vagina and the
anus somehow or another during the

2489
01:17:27,891 --> 01:17:28,341
operation.

2490
01:17:28,341 --> 01:17:33,260
They fucked it up and now she can't sing
without farting and it's like ruined

2491
01:17:33,261 --> 01:17:34,094
her career.

2492
01:17:36,010 --> 01:17:36,680
I mean I can't,

2493
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:37,513
I'm laughing,

2494
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:39,630
but it is really safe.

2495
01:17:40,510 --> 01:17:42,500
Farts farts are funny.

2496
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:42,981
Yeah,

2497
01:17:42,981 --> 01:17:43,490
but why?

2498
01:17:43,490 --> 01:17:44,410
I guess,

2499
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,160
I guess she can't sing.

2500
01:17:46,450 --> 01:17:49,220
You don't want to be on stage singing
opera in like you're farting all the time.

2501
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:49,761
There's one here.

2502
01:17:49,761 --> 01:17:51,470
It unless your farts are unbelievable.

2503
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:52,773
Unbelievable.

2504
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:55,820
It's just really stinky too.

2505
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:57,830
I think it'd be the sound.

2506
01:17:58,100 --> 01:17:59,390
Well now that I guess,

2507
01:17:59,391 --> 01:18:02,930
but now that it's out to all the people
in the front row are going to be like

2508
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:04,970
they're sniffing,

2509
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,100
waiting for her to hit the high notes.

2510
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:12,680
There's a reason that she should
be able to file a tort there.

2511
01:18:12,681 --> 01:18:13,760
It is malpractice.

2512
01:18:13,761 --> 01:18:15,860
I mean whenever you have that,

2513
01:18:15,861 --> 01:18:17,110
then you leave open the,

2514
01:18:17,111 --> 01:18:17,341
the,

2515
01:18:17,341 --> 01:18:17,560
the,

2516
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:17,901
you know,

2517
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:19,790
those fucking late night commercials,

2518
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:20,491
you know,

2519
01:18:20,491 --> 01:18:20,690
uh,

2520
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:23,240
have you been an injury
called James Suck or fuck,

2521
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:23,860
you know,

2522
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:24,380
I'm the,

2523
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:26,960
I specialize in getting
people what they deserve.

2524
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:29,390
No matter what policies that are passed,

2525
01:18:29,391 --> 01:18:31,760
no matter what regulation is available,

2526
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:35,390
there's always going to be
a small percentage of the
population that's going to

2527
01:18:35,391 --> 01:18:36,050
figure out.

2528
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:37,820
It's going to try to take advantage of it.

2529
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:40,790
And that's why we need strong laws.

2530
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:43,880
And that's why we need a judiciary.

2531
01:18:43,881 --> 01:18:44,121
You know,

2532
01:18:44,121 --> 01:18:46,580
that's the point of having
three branches of government.

2533
01:18:46,581 --> 01:18:50,030
We need a judiciary who can watch
out for the rights of the people.

2534
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:52,640
That's always going to happen.

2535
01:18:52,641 --> 01:18:56,750
And I think that when we legislate
for fear of that happening,

2536
01:18:56,810 --> 01:18:58,750
that's when we start to
get into huge trouble.

2537
01:18:58,790 --> 01:18:59,060
Let's,

2538
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:03,230
let's explore that cause why does that
have to happen and what a half do?

2539
01:19:03,231 --> 01:19:03,860
I just think that,

2540
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:04,700
but it always has.

2541
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:06,860
But why is that?

2542
01:19:06,970 --> 01:19:07,231
Why?

2543
01:19:07,231 --> 01:19:08,540
Why does that have to,

2544
01:19:08,570 --> 01:19:08,841
why?

2545
01:19:08,841 --> 01:19:13,841
Why is that a factor and is
there a variable that can
be considered amongst the

2546
01:19:13,911 --> 01:19:17,150
many variables that go into raising
and developing a human being?

2547
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:22,450
Is there some way that we can
engineer people to be less like that?

2548
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:23,961
Well,

2549
01:19:23,961 --> 01:19:27,680
there is something to be said about the
type of society that were raised at now.

2550
01:19:27,681 --> 01:19:30,710
Now fundamentally if you
want to go even beneath that,

2551
01:19:31,070 --> 01:19:33,470
if you want to talk about
evolution for example,

2552
01:19:33,471 --> 01:19:37,430
there is a survival instinct and all of
us and maybe you could make the argument

2553
01:19:37,431 --> 01:19:42,431
that the survival instinct can
downstream have something to do with a

2554
01:19:42,951 --> 01:19:44,240
competitive nature,

2555
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:44,631
right?

2556
01:19:44,631 --> 01:19:47,300
This like I need to make
sure that I'm eating enough,

2557
01:19:47,301 --> 01:19:49,040
I need to make sure that
I protect my family.

2558
01:19:49,041 --> 01:19:50,480
I need to make sure that I don't die.

2559
01:19:50,810 --> 01:19:54,380
There is probably actually an
environmental or I'm sorry,

2560
01:19:54,381 --> 01:19:56,090
I'm an evolutionary basis for that,

2561
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:57,380
but I think beyond that,

2562
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:58,581
if you compare,

2563
01:19:58,581 --> 01:20:00,500
for example our society,

2564
01:20:00,501 --> 01:20:02,810
too many societies in East Asia,

2565
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:07,860
what you find is a massive difference
between what we call an individual society

2566
01:20:07,861 --> 01:20:08,040
and

2567
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,270
a collectivist society.

2568
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:10,530
Our society,

2569
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:16,020
and I don't know if it's
based fundamentally on how
we govern or if it's based

2570
01:20:16,021 --> 01:20:18,330
on like massive cultural norms,

2571
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:21,570
but we are raised from the time
we're very small to feel highly,

2572
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:23,460
to have a highly competitive nature.

2573
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:24,990
I got to get the best grades,

2574
01:20:24,991 --> 01:20:26,100
I got to get the best,

2575
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:26,401
you know,

2576
01:20:26,401 --> 01:20:27,690
I got a win in sports.

2577
01:20:27,710 --> 01:20:30,930
I've somehow got to stand
out as an individual.

2578
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:31,471
Me,

2579
01:20:31,471 --> 01:20:31,681
me,

2580
01:20:31,681 --> 01:20:31,921
me,

2581
01:20:31,921 --> 01:20:32,580
III,

2582
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:34,260
and when you look at these
collectivist cultures,

2583
01:20:34,261 --> 01:20:36,000
it's all about we us,

2584
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:38,520
we're only as strong as
the weakest amongst us.

2585
01:20:38,521 --> 01:20:42,750
They have these like huge families where
you know grandma lives with multiple

2586
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:44,580
kids and then all the,

2587
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:48,690
you know the daughters and sons of them
live together and they help raise each

2588
01:20:48,691 --> 01:20:51,360
other and it's a very different culture.

2589
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:54,590
I don't know what the root
cause of that is but I,

2590
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:59,690
I do wonder if having that
very individualist nature
also contributes to having

2591
01:21:00,961 --> 01:21:05,961
this cutthroat kind of approach and
sometimes what from the outside might look

2592
01:21:07,441 --> 01:21:12,441
like a lack of empathy and a lack of
fundamental caring for those that are less

2593
01:21:12,481 --> 01:21:13,590
fortunate amongst us.

2594
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:15,650
It's also I think the,

2595
01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:20,210
the type of society that thrives on
innovation and the type of society that

2596
01:21:20,211 --> 01:21:24,260
thrives and success and type of Psi
that's going to foster these sort of

2597
01:21:24,261 --> 01:21:25,640
individual mentalities.

2598
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:28,490
Whereas these other more family oriented,

2599
01:21:28,491 --> 01:21:30,890
more tribal community oriented cultures,

2600
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:33,790
they're not going to
be so driven to succeed

2601
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:35,040
Communist.

2602
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:35,581
I mean these are,

2603
01:21:35,581 --> 01:21:36,560
these are off the society,

2604
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:37,740
communism,

2605
01:21:37,770 --> 01:21:42,030
these are societies that have a
history of communism in America,

2606
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:44,490
have never had a communist government.

2607
01:21:44,491 --> 01:21:46,860
We've always been a
republic since we started.

2608
01:21:47,130 --> 01:21:51,780
And I think that there's this
like fear of the word communism.

2609
01:21:51,781 --> 01:21:53,610
There's this fear of the word socialism.

2610
01:21:53,611 --> 01:21:54,444
And there's,

2611
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:57,750
even though we have a heavily
socialistic society as it is,

2612
01:21:57,751 --> 01:21:57,931
I mean,

2613
01:21:57,931 --> 01:22:01,680
we're a capitalist society that has a lot
of socialist values and that has a lot

2614
01:22:01,681 --> 01:22:03,630
of social programs that are available.

2615
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,090
If the minute you start pointing that out,

2616
01:22:06,091 --> 01:22:09,750
a lot of people get really
squeezed the word compassionate,

2617
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:10,890
passionate,

2618
01:22:10,890 --> 01:22:11,910
like the fire department,

2619
01:22:11,911 --> 01:22:12,151
you know,

2620
01:22:12,151 --> 01:22:12,984
it's compassionate.

2621
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:17,310
It's not something where we pool all of
our income together and pay taxes and

2622
01:22:17,311 --> 01:22:19,720
then have a public service
that's available to everyone.

2623
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:21,273
I found it interesting.

2624
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,990
I think that a lot of conservative people
would agree with you that because of

2625
01:22:23,991 --> 01:22:27,650
the bottom line would be less money
spent on these homeless people.

2626
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:30,450
I say a lot of younger conservatives
would agree with me cause I think a lot of

2627
01:22:30,451 --> 01:22:34,350
younger conservatives are much less
concerned about conservative values.

2628
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:35,551
Uh,

2629
01:22:35,551 --> 01:22:37,800
when it comes to social issues,

2630
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:39,030
a lot of young conservatives,

2631
01:22:39,031 --> 01:22:39,541
for example,

2632
01:22:39,541 --> 01:22:40,770
or for gay rights,

2633
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:43,680
but they're still fiscal conservatives.

2634
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:46,320
And that's why I would say that they'd
be much more concerned about the bottom

2635
01:22:46,321 --> 01:22:47,640
line cause their fiscal conservatives

2636
01:22:48,190 --> 01:22:48,450
gone.

2637
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:48,781
It is,

2638
01:22:48,781 --> 01:22:53,760
if you really are a patriotic person who
really believes in the idea of America

2639
01:22:53,761 --> 01:22:54,594
as a team,

2640
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:57,150
the best way to strengthen the
team is to have less losers.

2641
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:57,810
I agree.

2642
01:22:57,810 --> 01:23:01,740
The best way to have less losers is to
find the people at the lowest rung of the

2643
01:23:01,741 --> 01:23:06,030
socio economic food chain
and help them simple and,

2644
01:23:06,030 --> 01:23:07,600
and think of them as children.

2645
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:11,700
Don't think of them as lazy adults
because the lazy adults that you,

2646
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:12,020
you,

2647
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:14,710
you point out and demonize are just,

2648
01:23:15,010 --> 01:23:15,490
they're the,

2649
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:18,520
they're the fucking factories that are
making the babies that are going to grow

2650
01:23:18,521 --> 01:23:21,610
up to be human beings that are going to
have to deal with and interact with on a

2651
01:23:21,611 --> 01:23:22,990
daily basis and in life.

2652
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:27,490
But w w whether they're lazy or
not is outside of the question.

2653
01:23:27,610 --> 01:23:28,443
Forget them.

2654
01:23:28,690 --> 01:23:31,780
Concentrate on the fucking
children constantly in these
children that have this

2655
01:23:31,781 --> 01:23:36,100
horrible roll the dice and these children
are going to become those people who

2656
01:23:36,101 --> 01:23:36,701
are lazy.

2657
01:23:36,701 --> 01:23:38,410
And when you concentrate
on those children,

2658
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:42,250
I think you will understand that these
people that you're pointing to and

2659
01:23:42,251 --> 01:23:47,200
demonizing that I've had this horrible
roll of the dice that they've been dealt

2660
01:23:47,201 --> 01:23:51,220
this entirely impossible
to deal with hand.

2661
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:53,980
These are the fucking adults
that you're demonizing.

2662
01:23:54,470 --> 01:23:56,290
They haven't had the easiest road.

2663
01:23:56,350 --> 01:23:58,510
And taking that word lazy and really like,

2664
01:23:58,570 --> 01:24:01,240
what are you projecting when you
think of these people as being lazy,

2665
01:24:01,241 --> 01:24:05,050
like live a fucking week in their shoes
and tell me that they probably don't

2666
01:24:05,051 --> 01:24:08,980
work just as hard for no fucking income.

2667
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:09,820
You know what I mean?

2668
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:11,710
I want to fucking be a fry cook.

2669
01:24:12,010 --> 01:24:13,180
That sounds horrible.

2670
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:15,600
It sounds like a horrible
fucking job on it.

2671
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:17,200
It does not sound like fun.

2672
01:24:17,201 --> 01:24:17,831
It wasn't fun,

2673
01:24:17,831 --> 01:24:18,521
but it was all right.

2674
01:24:18,521 --> 01:24:19,310
But I was a kid.

2675
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:20,770
But did you feel like you were exactly,

2676
01:24:20,771 --> 01:24:21,910
and that's how it used to be.

2677
01:24:21,911 --> 01:24:23,000
It used to be the case that the,

2678
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:25,810
that kind of labor force was
taken up by young people.

2679
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:26,711
And now more and more,

2680
01:24:26,711 --> 01:24:29,050
I think the average person that
works in the fast food industry,

2681
01:24:29,051 --> 01:24:31,090
it's like 28 years old and like,

2682
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:32,410
is that person lazy?

2683
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:34,061
Um,

2684
01:24:34,061 --> 01:24:35,020
I don't think they're lazy.

2685
01:24:35,021 --> 01:24:35,590
I think,

2686
01:24:35,590 --> 01:24:39,580
I think there without a doubt
they're in a shitty road,

2687
01:24:39,610 --> 01:24:43,420
they're in Shitty road and they're
working a shit job that's hard and not on.

2688
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:47,830
I don't know if there's a solution
to that that are universally apply,

2689
01:24:47,831 --> 01:24:48,371
like say,

2690
01:24:48,371 --> 01:24:48,641
Oh,

2691
01:24:48,641 --> 01:24:51,850
well the reason why all these people
have these jobs cause a blank,

2692
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:56,230
let's just fit that into the system
and then we won't have a 28 year olds.

2693
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:56,810
It's,

2694
01:24:56,810 --> 01:24:56,991
it's,

2695
01:24:56,991 --> 01:24:57,171
it's,

2696
01:24:57,171 --> 01:24:59,620
it's about a lot of
policies across the board.

2697
01:24:59,621 --> 01:25:01,360
The problem is when you
actually are filling,

2698
01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:01,840
uh,

2699
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:05,820
legislation with a lot of policies that
keep income inequality where it is and

2700
01:25:05,821 --> 01:25:06,580
that keep,

2701
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:06,851
you know,

2702
01:25:06,851 --> 01:25:09,850
the little guy down and they keep
the rich people getting richer.

2703
01:25:09,970 --> 01:25:11,260
Did you see that recent study?

2704
01:25:11,290 --> 01:25:11,711
Oh God,

2705
01:25:11,711 --> 01:25:12,690
I hope I get the numbers right.

2706
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:14,890
That something like 85 people,

2707
01:25:15,430 --> 01:25:20,430
the top 85 people in the world have as
much wealth as the next 350 million.

2708
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:26,411
It's a problem.

2709
01:25:26,411 --> 01:25:31,411
When he tried to bang numbers
out like 85 85 350 million,

2710
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:34,840
what the fuck?

2711
01:25:34,841 --> 01:25:35,620
That never,

2712
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:37,690
that's never happened in the history of,

2713
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:39,280
of our global society.

2714
01:25:39,281 --> 01:25:40,960
I mean it's insane.

2715
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:45,850
Like it used to be something that the
average CEO made 40 times the salary of

2716
01:25:45,851 --> 01:25:49,990
his lowest paid worker and now
it's skyrocketed to like 400 plus.

2717
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:51,221
That's insane.

2718
01:25:51,221 --> 01:25:51,701
Here it is.

2719
01:25:51,701 --> 01:25:53,020
85 richest people,

2720
01:25:54,530 --> 01:25:56,080
not 350 million.

2721
01:25:56,081 --> 01:25:57,100
3.5 billion.

2722
01:25:57,101 --> 01:25:57,260
Yeah,

2723
01:25:57,260 --> 01:25:58,030
it's,

2724
01:25:58,030 --> 01:25:58,863
wow.

2725
01:25:59,050 --> 01:26:00,520
It's horrifying.

2726
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:01,780
3 billion,

2727
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:04,250
85 richest people in the
world own more wealth

2728
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:07,220
than 3 billion at a certain point.

2729
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:09,860
Who the fuck needs that much money?

2730
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:11,240
It's like a sickness.

2731
01:26:11,241 --> 01:26:14,480
Like you look at bill and Melinda Gates
who are incredibly wealthy and they've

2732
01:26:14,481 --> 01:26:15,231
given more,

2733
01:26:15,231 --> 01:26:17,060
they're the biggest
philanthropists in the world.

2734
01:26:17,330 --> 01:26:21,800
They have given so much money to people
who are less fortunate and that's how it

2735
01:26:21,801 --> 01:26:22,634
should be.

2736
01:26:22,670 --> 01:26:24,350
It's a windows or a MAC computer.

2737
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:25,160
I use Mac.

2738
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:27,020
I'm thinking about using a
windows just because of that,

2739
01:26:27,050 --> 01:26:28,190
just because that's a Steve jobs.

2740
01:26:28,191 --> 01:26:29,024
Kind of a con

2741
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:34,430
read recently that this guy
who's a billionaire investor
just dumped all of his

2742
01:26:34,431 --> 01:26:37,970
apple stock after you read Steve Jobs
biography and really like the guy's an

2743
01:26:37,971 --> 01:26:38,804
asshole.

2744
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:40,250
Don't care if he was good products.

2745
01:26:40,251 --> 01:26:40,851
I hate it.

2746
01:26:40,851 --> 01:26:41,930
I hate the idea behind it.

2747
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:44,180
It wasn't me kind of like on the spectrum.

2748
01:26:44,990 --> 01:26:47,780
I'm sure he was switched
over to an android phone.

2749
01:26:48,310 --> 01:26:49,370
I still use my iPhone.

2750
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:50,660
Same fuck you slowly.

2751
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:51,740
That's what I'm saying.

2752
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:52,190
You're a,

2753
01:26:52,190 --> 01:26:56,750
you're voting with your dollar
crazy with it is what we should do.

2754
01:26:56,860 --> 01:27:01,370
But I agree with you that you don't need
that much money and I agree with you,

2755
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:02,141
but why?

2756
01:27:02,141 --> 01:27:04,430
How does that happen
and how do you fix that?

2757
01:27:05,110 --> 01:27:05,261
Well,

2758
01:27:05,261 --> 01:27:09,050
I think one thing that you do
is you ensured that the laws,

2759
01:27:09,530 --> 01:27:12,170
it's not about preventing
rich people from getting rich.

2760
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:16,430
There's nothing wrong with
somebody pulling themselves
up from their bootstraps.

2761
01:27:16,431 --> 01:27:17,031
There's nothing wrong.

2762
01:27:17,031 --> 01:27:18,890
If you come from a wealthy family,

2763
01:27:18,891 --> 01:27:20,180
being able to maintain your wealth,

2764
01:27:20,181 --> 01:27:24,080
but the system shouldn't be rigged in
such a way that you get more help from

2765
01:27:24,081 --> 01:27:26,210
your government than poor people do.

2766
01:27:26,270 --> 01:27:27,320
That's unfair.

2767
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:32,500
So having the kind of tax code so that
rich people can find so many loopholes

2768
01:27:33,441 --> 01:27:35,750
that they're actually
paying less effective tax.

2769
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,160
Then you know,

2770
01:27:37,161 --> 01:27:40,990
somebody who's working as
an administrative assistant
than somebody who's

2771
01:27:41,030 --> 01:27:41,420
working.

2772
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:42,550
It's true.

2773
01:27:42,670 --> 01:27:43,060
I mean,

2774
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:43,893
look,

2775
01:27:44,450 --> 01:27:46,100
there's unavoidable taxes.

2776
01:27:46,130 --> 01:27:46,400
There's,

2777
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:49,610
there's a certain amount of taxes
that if you are a very wealthy person,

2778
01:27:49,611 --> 01:27:50,444
you just have to pay.

2779
01:27:50,590 --> 01:27:52,040
But a lot of people have certain,

2780
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:52,670
uh,

2781
01:27:52,670 --> 01:27:54,470
a lot of their assets
in offshore accounts.

2782
01:27:54,471 --> 01:27:59,270
A lot of people are able to pay themselves
almost a nil salary and put the rest

2783
01:27:59,271 --> 01:28:01,520
of their money into some
sort of corporate entity.

2784
01:28:01,730 --> 01:28:05,600
And corporate tax rates are significantly
lower than individual tax rates in

2785
01:28:05,601 --> 01:28:06,740
certain examples.

2786
01:28:06,741 --> 01:28:06,951
And so,

2787
01:28:06,951 --> 01:28:07,460
yes,

2788
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:09,830
we have so much corporate
welfare in this country.

2789
01:28:09,831 --> 01:28:11,060
I mean a lot of people,

2790
01:28:11,061 --> 01:28:13,550
even where we are in life,

2791
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:16,670
I know a lot of people who work as
independent contractors and Hollywood and

2792
01:28:16,671 --> 01:28:20,360
what they do is they kind of rigged
their taxes so that their accountant they

2793
01:28:20,361 --> 01:28:20,990
have,

2794
01:28:20,990 --> 01:28:22,010
they're incorporated.

2795
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:25,040
So like you would be like
Joe Rogan incorporated,

2796
01:28:25,070 --> 01:28:27,620
and what you would do is
you would get everything,

2797
01:28:27,621 --> 01:28:30,020
every check you ever earned
made out to your corporation,

2798
01:28:30,021 --> 01:28:31,700
and then you would pay yourself a salary.

2799
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:36,470
You pay yourself the bare minimum salary
to be able to pay rent and bills with

2800
01:28:36,471 --> 01:28:37,850
like no spending money.

2801
01:28:38,330 --> 01:28:38,751
And so,

2802
01:28:38,751 --> 01:28:39,260
okay,

2803
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:42,950
Joe Rogan only makes $20,000
a year because of that,

2804
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:47,510
which means you only pay taxes on
$20,000 a year at an individual tax rate,

2805
01:28:47,511 --> 01:28:51,320
and your corporation pays corporate
taxes on everything else that you earned

2806
01:28:51,321 --> 01:28:51,970
during the year.

2807
01:28:51,970 --> 01:28:52,690
It's a very,

2808
01:28:52,690 --> 01:28:56,540
I mean that's just a very simple example
of completely cheating the tax system.

2809
01:28:56,690 --> 01:28:58,940
But what happens with
these people who can hire,

2810
01:28:58,970 --> 01:29:02,400
who can afford to hire like
10,000 an hour lawyers,

2811
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:06,570
they can get away with not
paying almost any taxes.

2812
01:29:06,870 --> 01:29:07,703
And the,

2813
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:08,101
again,

2814
01:29:08,101 --> 01:29:09,120
the little guys kept down.

2815
01:29:09,121 --> 01:29:09,871
He can't afford that.

2816
01:29:09,871 --> 01:29:11,190
He's going to h and r block.

2817
01:29:11,191 --> 01:29:15,420
He's trying to figure out how to deduct
things just to be able to afford to pay

2818
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:17,460
the taxes and still be able to,

2819
01:29:17,490 --> 01:29:17,700
you know,

2820
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:18,930
put food in his kids' mouths.

2821
01:29:18,940 --> 01:29:19,351
It's just,

2822
01:29:19,351 --> 01:29:21,030
it's a fucked up system.

2823
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:25,350
You're just going to keep the richer
a bit of a problem with that type of

2824
01:29:25,351 --> 01:29:26,070
thinking.

2825
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:30,570
I don't agree that it's a good idea to
give the government more money and I

2826
01:29:30,571 --> 01:29:35,571
don't agree that giving them more tax
money is in some way going to help out

2827
01:29:35,701 --> 01:29:39,720
these poor people and I don't agree
that taking money from these people like

2828
01:29:39,721 --> 01:29:44,721
saying like what France just pass pass
recently a new log chart taking the most

2829
01:29:46,051 --> 01:29:49,710
rich and making their tax of 75% I don't,

2830
01:29:49,770 --> 01:29:53,340
I don't trust them to take that money
and do anything prudent with it.

2831
01:29:53,370 --> 01:29:56,430
I don't did under Eisenhower when
the rich had the highest tax rate,

2832
01:29:56,431 --> 01:29:59,640
we have the best economy that
we've seen in a really long time,

2833
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:01,290
but that's a completely different as arm.

2834
01:30:01,291 --> 01:30:02,130
It's totally different.

2835
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:05,970
It's very different to compare those
things and so I'm not saying that,

2836
01:30:05,971 --> 01:30:07,590
I mean for whatever,

2837
01:30:07,591 --> 01:30:11,130
I believe whether we would advocate for
a higher tax bracket for rich people

2838
01:30:11,131 --> 01:30:12,150
versus poor people,

2839
01:30:12,151 --> 01:30:12,331
blah,

2840
01:30:12,331 --> 01:30:12,481
blah,

2841
01:30:12,481 --> 01:30:13,110
blah.

2842
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:18,090
The fundamental thing is we're not living
in a good system where rich people can

2843
01:30:18,091 --> 01:30:22,170
get away with paying significantly less
percentage of their income in taxes.

2844
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:23,730
Then somebody who's poor,

2845
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:25,140
well that's certainly not good,

2846
01:30:25,141 --> 01:30:27,650
but is that what's keeping
these people pour in his,

2847
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:29,100
that was keeping these people rich?

2848
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:30,870
Is it just the taxes that will,

2849
01:30:30,871 --> 01:30:31,481
that's the,

2850
01:30:31,481 --> 01:30:33,390
that's the only thing,

2851
01:30:33,391 --> 01:30:36,060
but that is a huge thing
that helps keep rich people.

2852
01:30:37,050 --> 01:30:40,350
The idea of giving that money
to the government there,

2853
01:30:40,351 --> 01:30:42,330
therefore the people
aren't as rich anymore.

2854
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,800
Therefore everything's good.

2855
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:46,740
I don't think it is because then the
government just has this money and what

2856
01:30:46,741 --> 01:30:47,221
does it do?

2857
01:30:47,221 --> 01:30:48,120
It just bloats up.

2858
01:30:48,121 --> 01:30:51,360
The bureaucracy adds more
people in government functions.

2859
01:30:51,870 --> 01:30:55,680
We don't even need me because that money
should be going to really good social

2860
01:30:55,681 --> 01:30:56,341
programs.

2861
01:30:56,341 --> 01:30:57,660
It should be going to them.

2862
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:02,580
I think that we would be way better off
if people contributed to these social

2863
01:31:02,581 --> 01:31:03,180
problems,

2864
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:05,400
social programs voluntarily.

2865
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:09,120
I think it would be even better if we
had some sort of a system like you see in

2866
01:31:09,121 --> 01:31:13,260
a lot of developed European countries
where there is a certain amount of public

2867
01:31:13,261 --> 01:31:15,270
service that we're required to make.

2868
01:31:15,271 --> 01:31:16,920
Like in a lot of European countries,

2869
01:31:16,921 --> 01:31:21,300
what happens is that you're required to
basically give let's say a year of your

2870
01:31:21,301 --> 01:31:22,980
life or maybe more um,

2871
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:25,130
to the government.

2872
01:31:25,131 --> 01:31:25,500
Like you're,

2873
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:29,460
you're required to serve your country for
a full year and then your education is

2874
01:31:29,461 --> 01:31:30,420
covered in,

2875
01:31:30,421 --> 01:31:30,721
you know,

2876
01:31:30,721 --> 01:31:31,800
college or something like that.

2877
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:33,030
And it can be anything.

2878
01:31:33,210 --> 01:31:34,590
It could be militarily,

2879
01:31:34,591 --> 01:31:35,400
it could be some,

2880
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:35,881
you know,

2881
01:31:35,881 --> 01:31:36,091
in,

2882
01:31:36,091 --> 01:31:37,170
in volunteer work,

2883
01:31:37,171 --> 01:31:39,660
whatever reason so that as
young people are growing up,

2884
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:42,180
they just know when I
get to a certain age,

2885
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:43,111
this is what I do.

2886
01:31:43,111 --> 01:31:46,920
I'm going to serve my country and
with it I'm going to get a secure

2887
01:31:46,921 --> 01:31:49,320
understanding that I'm going
to be able to get an education.

2888
01:31:49,530 --> 01:31:52,050
And it ends up being incredibly
good for the economy.

2889
01:31:52,051 --> 01:31:54,470
And I think it's actually
from a moral perspective,

2890
01:31:54,490 --> 01:31:55,590
good for people.

2891
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:57,420
I think people should serve.

2892
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,010
I think that's a good idea.

2893
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:00,070
If the system is in

2894
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:00,903
place isn't

2895
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:03,960
politically cockeyed and fucked and
that's a huge problem in America because

2896
01:32:03,970 --> 01:32:04,803
their system is

2897
01:32:04,890 --> 01:32:07,320
not giving these dummies
a year of my life.

2898
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:08,241
Well yeah,

2899
01:32:08,241 --> 01:32:09,950
I think the way they manage right now,

2900
01:32:10,250 --> 01:32:11,480
that would be a huge problem.

2901
01:32:11,481 --> 01:32:12,380
But fundamentally,

2902
01:32:12,381 --> 01:32:13,071
and this is the thing,

2903
01:32:13,071 --> 01:32:13,904
whenever you have,

2904
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:14,480
you know,

2905
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:19,480
these like long conversations about any
of these real heavy kind of social or

2906
01:32:20,481 --> 01:32:24,890
governmental issues is that I think
truly it comes down to campaign finance

2907
01:32:24,891 --> 01:32:25,724
reform.

2908
01:32:25,730 --> 01:32:29,600
A lot of the problems with the way that
our country's governed comes down to the

2909
01:32:29,601 --> 01:32:32,030
fact that the incentive is
always to win elections.

2910
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:33,830
It's not actually to be an effective,

2911
01:32:34,210 --> 01:32:34,510
uh,

2912
01:32:34,510 --> 01:32:36,170
executor or legislator.

2913
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:41,320
So you work so hard and you raise so
much money to have the better ads so that

2914
01:32:41,841 --> 01:32:45,110
you can then win your election
and the entire time that you're,

2915
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:48,410
you're expected to actually
be serving the public,

2916
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:50,120
all you're doing is fundraising.

2917
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:54,320
That's your whole job is to fundraise to
make more money so that you can stay in

2918
01:32:54,321 --> 01:32:56,060
office and it's,

2919
01:32:56,660 --> 01:33:00,680
it's the crux of our system and it's
what keeps it so incredibly broken.

2920
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:05,210
If it didn't cost money
to run for elected office,

2921
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:09,920
if you weren't allowed to
have advertisements that
were paid for with private

2922
01:33:09,921 --> 01:33:10,754
funds,

2923
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:16,280
there would be a totally different way
that people govern because when it comes

2924
01:33:16,281 --> 01:33:17,240
down to the money,

2925
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:17,890
it,

2926
01:33:17,890 --> 01:33:18,410
it,

2927
01:33:18,410 --> 01:33:22,970
it really does Solly every single
part of the governmental process.

2928
01:33:24,050 --> 01:33:25,610
I certainly think that there's the,

2929
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:30,620
the motivation becomes financial and when
a financial motivations take precedent

2930
01:33:31,401 --> 01:33:32,420
above all others,

2931
01:33:32,450 --> 01:33:37,450
you have this a moral drive to just
increase numbers and I think that's a huge

2932
01:33:38,121 --> 01:33:40,070
issue with corporations in general.

2933
01:33:40,071 --> 01:33:45,071
Just the idea of corporations being this
entity that consumes and and produces

2934
01:33:46,161 --> 01:33:50,190
and is all about ones and Zeros
in the bottom line above humanity

2935
01:33:50,290 --> 01:33:51,123
and that's the problem.

2936
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:54,760
There is absolutely nothing wrong with
doing something brilliant and making a

2937
01:33:54,761 --> 01:33:55,990
shitload of money off of it.

2938
01:33:56,110 --> 01:33:58,600
If you're not destroying the environment,

2939
01:33:58,810 --> 01:34:02,290
you're not stepping on the backs of
people who are easy to take advantage of.

2940
01:34:02,291 --> 01:34:05,350
In order to get your bottom
line down even lower.

2941
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:06,251
You know there,

2942
01:34:06,251 --> 01:34:08,530
there are fundamental things
that you have to fulfill.

2943
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:10,030
And above and beyond that,

2944
01:34:10,031 --> 01:34:12,460
if you can profit good for fucking you.

2945
01:34:12,490 --> 01:34:13,720
I want you to be a billionaire.

2946
01:34:13,721 --> 01:34:15,250
I want you to get as rich as possible.

2947
01:34:15,940 --> 01:34:16,370
The,

2948
01:34:16,370 --> 01:34:17,960
the attitude in this country is,

2949
01:34:17,961 --> 01:34:20,630
so what if there's a
certain amount of pollution?

2950
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:24,170
So what if there's a certain amount of
environmental damage as long as there's a

2951
01:34:24,171 --> 01:34:25,070
certain amount of profit.

2952
01:34:25,180 --> 01:34:30,180
And so what if you are literally like
fucking stepping on the backs of people

2953
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:32,673
who,

2954
01:34:32,860 --> 01:34:35,140
who can't defend themselves
if you get a certain amount.

2955
01:34:35,141 --> 01:34:35,530
I mean,

2956
01:34:35,530 --> 01:34:37,990
it's the same core argument.

2957
01:34:38,170 --> 01:34:40,930
It's the same reason that our economy
is booming in the first place because it

2958
01:34:40,931 --> 01:34:42,880
was all founded on slavery.

2959
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:44,650
And it's not that different.

2960
01:34:44,651 --> 01:34:46,360
Like if you look at these kind of,

2961
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:50,890
this moral perspective that
that Americans had early is,

2962
01:34:51,050 --> 01:34:55,180
is we had an agricultural society right
before the industrial revolution and

2963
01:34:55,181 --> 01:34:56,920
then it moved into a factory society.

2964
01:34:57,110 --> 01:34:59,150
But when slavery was still legal it,

2965
01:34:59,151 --> 01:34:59,541
fuck,

2966
01:34:59,541 --> 01:34:59,741
yeah.

2967
01:34:59,741 --> 01:35:02,540
It's easy to make a shitload of profits
when you're not paying any of your

2968
01:35:02,541 --> 01:35:06,470
workers when they're required
to work for you for free.

2969
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:09,980
And you can treat them as Shitty as you
want to and you don't have basic human

2970
01:35:09,981 --> 01:35:11,540
dignity that you have
to take care of them.

2971
01:35:12,050 --> 01:35:12,690
That's in the Bible.

2972
01:35:12,690 --> 01:35:13,270
Exactly.

2973
01:35:13,270 --> 01:35:13,670
I mean,

2974
01:35:13,670 --> 01:35:14,503
you're allowed to have slaves,

2975
01:35:14,540 --> 01:35:15,380
and don't get me wrong,

2976
01:35:15,381 --> 01:35:17,330
this goes long before American caution.

2977
01:35:17,331 --> 01:35:18,141
I'll beat him to death.

2978
01:35:18,141 --> 01:35:18,851
But you're allowed to have,

2979
01:35:18,851 --> 01:35:19,101
yeah,

2980
01:35:19,101 --> 01:35:19,761
that's beautiful.

2981
01:35:19,761 --> 01:35:22,070
It's a beautiful piece of work and
they live for a couple of days.

2982
01:35:22,071 --> 01:35:22,600
It's okay.

2983
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:23,060
Yeah.

2984
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:25,940
And then after that you've got indentured
servitude and then after that you've

2985
01:35:25,941 --> 01:35:26,181
got,

2986
01:35:26,181 --> 01:35:26,361
you know,

2987
01:35:26,361 --> 01:35:28,760
the fucking Lowell factory girls
and you've got child labor.

2988
01:35:28,761 --> 01:35:29,390
We have a,

2989
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:33,290
we have a long history of taking advantage
of those who are less fortunate in

2990
01:35:33,291 --> 01:35:34,910
order to make a buck off of their backs.

2991
01:35:34,911 --> 01:35:35,900
And it's gross.

2992
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:38,840
And I think it's something
that if that could change,

2993
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:39,351
yes,

2994
01:35:39,351 --> 01:35:43,220
we might not be as much
of a fucking booming,

2995
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:43,581
you know,

2996
01:35:43,581 --> 01:35:44,780
wealthy society.

2997
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:47,570
But at least we would
be taking care of the,

2998
01:35:47,571 --> 01:35:52,130
the weakest amongst us and as a whole
we would have strengths and we wouldn't

2999
01:35:52,131 --> 01:35:57,131
see the top 85 people getting richer and
richer and the bottom three in the next

3000
01:35:58,401 --> 01:36:00,740
3 billion over only
having that much money.

3001
01:36:00,770 --> 01:36:04,340
What is the solution to something
that's so disproportionate like that?

3002
01:36:04,341 --> 01:36:09,341
Like how does one step in in 2014 and
look at the 85 people that have so much

3003
01:36:09,591 --> 01:36:10,424
money,

3004
01:36:11,210 --> 01:36:12,760
the billions that you know,

3005
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,150
look at these people and say,

3006
01:36:14,151 --> 01:36:14,984
how the fuck,

3007
01:36:15,170 --> 01:36:16,003
how was that?

3008
01:36:16,010 --> 01:36:17,400
How's it possible to,

3009
01:36:17,420 --> 01:36:17,621
I mean,

3010
01:36:17,621 --> 01:36:18,980
I don't know how to engineer that.

3011
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:20,960
I Dunno if there's a
simple answer to that,

3012
01:36:20,961 --> 01:36:23,600
but I think probably the first thing
that you have to start doing is cleaning

3013
01:36:23,601 --> 01:36:23,901
house.

3014
01:36:23,901 --> 01:36:25,130
You have to look at the books,

3015
01:36:25,131 --> 01:36:26,040
you have to look at it.

3016
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:29,540
Let's look at the legacy of making this
kind of money and let's make sure that

3017
01:36:29,541 --> 01:36:31,820
all of that money was
made completely morally.

3018
01:36:32,030 --> 01:36:35,060
Let's make sure that nobody was
fucking destroyed in the process.

3019
01:36:35,061 --> 01:36:38,150
Let's make sure that nobody was taking
heavily taken advantage of heavily.

3020
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:39,200
Let's make sure that the,

3021
01:36:39,390 --> 01:36:41,390
the globe wasn't getting
fucked in the ass.

3022
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:42,350
And in doing this,

3023
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:44,330
and as soon as you start taking those,

3024
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:46,010
those things out and you start saying,

3025
01:36:46,011 --> 01:36:46,341
okay,

3026
01:36:46,341 --> 01:36:49,700
well you've got to make sure that your
lowest paid workers are treated with

3027
01:36:49,701 --> 01:36:52,730
fucking dignity and that
they earn a living wage.

3028
01:36:52,850 --> 01:36:55,760
You've got to make sure that you offer
health insurance to the people that work

3029
01:36:55,761 --> 01:36:56,211
underneath.

3030
01:36:56,211 --> 01:36:56,620
You've got to make,

3031
01:36:56,620 --> 01:36:57,260
you know,

3032
01:36:57,260 --> 01:36:58,550
once you go through all these things,

3033
01:36:58,700 --> 01:37:00,410
maybe that person makes less money.

3034
01:37:00,411 --> 01:37:01,460
Maybe they make more money.

3035
01:37:01,461 --> 01:37:03,920
I have no problem with
rich people being rich.

3036
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:07,610
I've problem with rich people being
rich on the backs of poor people.

3037
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:09,080
That's my real problem.

3038
01:37:09,170 --> 01:37:11,960
You are the total
counterpoint to Peter Schiff,

3039
01:37:11,961 --> 01:37:15,320
who's on the podcast last
week who defended fracking.

3040
01:37:15,460 --> 01:37:15,750
You know,

3041
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:16,400
who's,

3042
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,080
who's like a few places get fucked up.

3043
01:37:18,081 --> 01:37:18,591
Who Cares?

3044
01:37:18,591 --> 01:37:20,780
The farmers got millions of
dollars because they got fucked up.

3045
01:37:21,050 --> 01:37:21,883
Like it's no big deal.

3046
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:23,630
Companies look at it.

3047
01:37:23,860 --> 01:37:24,140
I mean,

3048
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:24,591
I had,

3049
01:37:24,591 --> 01:37:24,830
um,

3050
01:37:24,830 --> 01:37:28,880
I used to work for a neuropsychologist
back in Texas and he,

3051
01:37:28,881 --> 01:37:29,031
uh,

3052
01:37:29,031 --> 01:37:31,460
we had a contract with the
Texas Commission for the blind.

3053
01:37:31,461 --> 01:37:33,950
So a lot of the patients that we saw had,

3054
01:37:34,010 --> 01:37:38,210
I'm sorry it had visual
impairment or blindness and um,

3055
01:37:38,690 --> 01:37:38,811
oh,

3056
01:37:38,811 --> 01:37:41,000
that's a totally different tack that
doesn't even apply to this story.

3057
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:43,610
And another thing that he did is he was a,

3058
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:46,460
he was an expert witness in court cases.

3059
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:48,140
And so one time he was,

3060
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:48,770
uh,

3061
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:52,550
going on to be an expert witness about
this girl who had taken cough medicine

3062
01:37:52,551 --> 01:37:54,290
like totally over the
counter cough medicine.

3063
01:37:54,291 --> 01:37:55,124
And she had a fucking,

3064
01:37:55,710 --> 01:37:56,340
she was like a,

3065
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:56,791
you know,

3066
01:37:56,791 --> 01:37:58,800
a healthy nine year old girl
took this cough medicine,

3067
01:37:58,801 --> 01:37:59,634
had a stroke.

3068
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:03,150
And I really don't know anything about
the medical implications or why it

3069
01:38:03,151 --> 01:38:03,510
happened.

3070
01:38:03,510 --> 01:38:06,540
But apparently you look at the records
and you look at the history and something

3071
01:38:06,541 --> 01:38:09,000
like one in 1 billion cases,

3072
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:11,640
a kid's going to take this cough
medicine and have a fucking stroke.

3073
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:13,740
And the truth is,

3074
01:38:13,741 --> 01:38:17,520
the bottom line is so low that it's more
cost effective for this pharmaceutical

3075
01:38:17,521 --> 01:38:19,980
company to just pay these
people out and say like,

3076
01:38:20,010 --> 01:38:20,101
oh,

3077
01:38:20,101 --> 01:38:20,881
that fucking sucks.

3078
01:38:20,881 --> 01:38:22,110
We're so sorry this happened.

3079
01:38:22,350 --> 01:38:25,890
But the risk benefit analysis shows us
that it's still worth it to have this

3080
01:38:25,891 --> 01:38:27,180
cough medicine on the market.

3081
01:38:27,330 --> 01:38:29,700
Here's your money to take care
of you for the rest of your life.

3082
01:38:29,701 --> 01:38:32,550
Cause he had a fucking stroke and there's
like no way you're going to be able to

3083
01:38:32,551 --> 01:38:34,080
work the same way you could have before.

3084
01:38:34,290 --> 01:38:38,100
We're going to keep our product on the
market because we still are making a

3085
01:38:38,101 --> 01:38:38,911
massive profit.

3086
01:38:38,911 --> 01:38:41,040
Even if we pay you out
for having your stroke.

3087
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:42,990
And this is the way that a lot of,

3088
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:43,883
uh,

3089
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:44,580
you know,

3090
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:46,170
pharmaceutical companies operate.

3091
01:38:46,171 --> 01:38:47,580
And sometimes it makes sense.

3092
01:38:47,970 --> 01:38:49,890
You have to look at a
risk benefit analysis.

3093
01:38:49,891 --> 01:38:51,910
Let's say you have HIV
and there's a drone.

3094
01:38:51,930 --> 01:38:52,151
I mean,

3095
01:38:52,151 --> 01:38:52,540
every,

3096
01:38:52,540 --> 01:38:54,390
everybody probably saw Dallas buyers club,

3097
01:38:54,391 --> 01:38:54,840
like,

3098
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:55,291
you know,

3099
01:38:55,291 --> 01:38:55,830
uh,

3100
01:38:55,830 --> 01:38:57,680
when they were first looking at AACT,

3101
01:38:57,690 --> 01:38:57,901
you know,

3102
01:38:57,901 --> 01:38:58,261
different,

3103
01:38:58,261 --> 01:39:00,690
different drugs that were on the
market were really dangerous.

3104
01:39:00,691 --> 01:39:01,140
And is it,

3105
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:05,730
are you worse off being sick from the
drug or are you worse off with Your Hiv,

3106
01:39:06,050 --> 01:39:06,180
uh,

3107
01:39:06,180 --> 01:39:07,980
getting worse and progressing to AIDS?

3108
01:39:07,981 --> 01:39:08,191
You know,

3109
01:39:08,191 --> 01:39:11,460
it's always a risk benefit
analysis and it's never that clean.

3110
01:39:11,490 --> 01:39:13,410
And that's the problem when
we have these conversations,

3111
01:39:13,411 --> 01:39:16,170
like what is the solution?

3112
01:39:16,171 --> 01:39:16,920
What is the cure?

3113
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:17,041
Well,

3114
01:39:17,041 --> 01:39:18,720
it's fucking nuanced and it's always,

3115
01:39:18,721 --> 01:39:23,130
it's not always that straight forward
and it's really about risk and benefit.

3116
01:39:23,131 --> 01:39:26,100
But this is where capitalism
can go awry really quickly.

3117
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:29,040
Because if you say the bottom
line is the number one measure,

3118
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:30,690
then you get in a lot of trouble.

3119
01:39:30,780 --> 01:39:31,351
But what about,

3120
01:39:31,351 --> 01:39:32,070
I mean,

3121
01:39:32,070 --> 01:39:33,450
when you're dealing with medications,

3122
01:39:33,451 --> 01:39:38,451
you have also these extreme variables
as far as like biological diversity,

3123
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:40,920
the difference in human bodies.

3124
01:39:41,130 --> 01:39:42,570
Some people are allergic to peanuts,

3125
01:39:42,571 --> 01:39:43,350
some people,

3126
01:39:43,350 --> 01:39:45,450
they're around dogs and
their eyes close shot.

3127
01:39:45,630 --> 01:39:47,520
It was so much difference and it's,

3128
01:39:47,580 --> 01:39:47,881
yeah,

3129
01:39:47,881 --> 01:39:48,030
it's,

3130
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:48,751
it's really tough.

3131
01:39:48,751 --> 01:39:48,921
And,

3132
01:39:48,921 --> 01:39:49,041
and,

3133
01:39:49,041 --> 01:39:51,840
and you can give a hundred people
that same medication have no issues

3134
01:39:51,841 --> 01:39:52,321
whatsoever,

3135
01:39:52,321 --> 01:39:53,370
and one person dies.

3136
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:56,620
What do you do if a hundred people
benefit and one person dies from,

3137
01:39:56,710 --> 01:39:58,140
sometimes that shit's going to happen.

3138
01:39:58,141 --> 01:39:59,040
But on top of that,

3139
01:39:59,041 --> 01:40:01,470
one thing you can do is make sure
that when you do your human trials,

3140
01:40:01,471 --> 01:40:03,240
you don't normally give it to 300 people.

3141
01:40:03,270 --> 01:40:03,511
I mean,

3142
01:40:03,511 --> 01:40:07,440
there are too many drugs on the market
right now where the human trials were,

3143
01:40:07,470 --> 01:40:08,303
um,

3144
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:09,420
were fast tracked,

3145
01:40:09,421 --> 01:40:14,130
where the FDA wasn't as
thorough as they needed to be.

3146
01:40:14,610 --> 01:40:15,061
Argument.

3147
01:40:15,061 --> 01:40:17,100
He was saying that we don't
need ready regulation.

3148
01:40:17,190 --> 01:40:17,761
Oh my God,

3149
01:40:17,761 --> 01:40:18,730
that's the most insane.

3150
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:19,141
I mean,

3151
01:40:19,141 --> 01:40:21,030
look at what's happening
in West Virginia right now.

3152
01:40:21,860 --> 01:40:23,040
We didn't have regulation.

3153
01:40:23,041 --> 01:40:25,380
All of those people in West
Virginia would be fucking dead.

3154
01:40:25,620 --> 01:40:26,131
You know what I mean?

3155
01:40:26,131 --> 01:40:27,030
They'd be drinking this one.

3156
01:40:27,210 --> 01:40:28,290
They're fucked anyway.

3157
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:30,850
And like this is what happens
when we have regulations.

3158
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,960
Fucking might not even know
what's happening in West Virginia.

3159
01:40:33,961 --> 01:40:34,110
So,

3160
01:40:34,110 --> 01:40:34,400
right.

3161
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:36,930
It was because of fracking and
there was like some horrible,

3162
01:40:36,931 --> 01:40:37,980
or it was like oil.

3163
01:40:38,010 --> 01:40:38,371
No,

3164
01:40:38,371 --> 01:40:39,030
it was like,

3165
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:39,720
yeah,

3166
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:40,590
it was a chemical spill,

3167
01:40:40,591 --> 01:40:42,270
but it was from like an oil company.

3168
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:45,600
And so what happened is there were these
reserves that were down river from a

3169
01:40:45,601 --> 01:40:46,830
water processing plant.

3170
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:47,970
There was a spell,

3171
01:40:47,971 --> 01:40:48,870
it fell into the,

3172
01:40:48,871 --> 01:40:49,111
uh,

3173
01:40:49,111 --> 01:40:52,350
into the river and
people started drinking,

3174
01:40:52,351 --> 01:40:56,260
or actually a lot of people were saved
because the water smelled like licorice

3175
01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:58,090
and they noticed the water smells weird,

3176
01:40:58,091 --> 01:40:59,260
maybe I shouldn't drink it.

3177
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:02,620
So a lot of people actually didn't get
sick because they didn't drink the water

3178
01:41:02,621 --> 01:41:02,981
for a while.

3179
01:41:02,981 --> 01:41:04,330
And then the government
came back and said,

3180
01:41:04,331 --> 01:41:04,810
okay,

3181
01:41:04,810 --> 01:41:05,480
we've,

3182
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:06,130
you know,

3183
01:41:06,130 --> 01:41:07,840
mitigated the situation as best we can,

3184
01:41:08,170 --> 01:41:09,550
go ahead and drink the water.

3185
01:41:09,551 --> 01:41:10,480
And people started drinking it,

3186
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:14,080
but it still was not nearly as
detoxified as it needed to be.

3187
01:41:14,081 --> 01:41:16,540
So now people are having
all sorts of complaints,

3188
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:17,680
injuries that are having,

3189
01:41:17,830 --> 01:41:18,131
you know,

3190
01:41:18,131 --> 01:41:23,131
rashes and allergies and all the way
down to like neurological issues based on

3191
01:41:23,981 --> 01:41:24,400
this.

3192
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:27,010
And this is the end part of
the reason that this happened,

3193
01:41:27,011 --> 01:41:29,920
they say is because
this plant hadn't been.

3194
01:41:29,980 --> 01:41:30,760
Um,

3195
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:31,061
uh,

3196
01:41:31,061 --> 01:41:31,301
so,

3197
01:41:31,301 --> 01:41:34,030
so the regulations in place
required that these plants,

3198
01:41:34,330 --> 01:41:35,110
uh,

3199
01:41:35,110 --> 01:41:38,230
have inspections and it hadn't
been inspected since like 1991.

3200
01:41:39,130 --> 01:41:39,611
Is that right?

3201
01:41:39,611 --> 01:41:40,660
91 or 92.

3202
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:43,300
It was a fucking long time ago.

3203
01:41:43,330 --> 01:41:44,020
It was two.

3204
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:45,730
And this is what happens when we have,

3205
01:41:46,270 --> 01:41:49,210
as a lot of these anti-regulation
people say quote unquote,

3206
01:41:49,211 --> 01:41:51,250
too much regulation in this country.

3207
01:41:51,580 --> 01:41:54,310
What I found fascinating was after
the conversation with Peter Schiff,

3208
01:41:54,311 --> 01:41:59,290
how many people were a defending him
and be being really aggressive about how

3209
01:41:59,291 --> 01:42:01,920
safe fracking is and you know,

3210
01:42:01,921 --> 01:42:04,660
and insulting me and like
the Twitter comments.

3211
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:06,700
But it's that hard right wing.

3212
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:07,481
The people,

3213
01:42:07,481 --> 01:42:08,141
and by the way,

3214
01:42:08,141 --> 01:42:08,771
a guarantee you,

3215
01:42:08,771 --> 01:42:10,330
the majority of them are not rich,

3216
01:42:10,570 --> 01:42:15,400
but they have this attitude that they
want things to be in place so that when

3217
01:42:15,401 --> 01:42:16,600
their time comes,

3218
01:42:16,780 --> 01:42:18,610
the regulations are free and clear.

3219
01:42:18,611 --> 01:42:20,740
So they have a straight
highway to success.

3220
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:24,310
I think you even see a lot of pro
science people that are very split about

3221
01:42:24,311 --> 01:42:28,720
fracking because the evidence isn't
completely in and there are some dangers,

3222
01:42:28,721 --> 01:42:31,990
but in some ways it's still safer
than maybe other ways to drill.

3223
01:42:32,250 --> 01:42:32,530
Um,

3224
01:42:32,530 --> 01:42:33,430
but truth be told,

3225
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:37,690
our fucking dependence on fossil
fuels is what's really getting us.

3226
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:38,471
You know what I mean?

3227
01:42:38,471 --> 01:42:39,010
It's like,

3228
01:42:39,010 --> 01:42:41,970
I don't want to keep inventing
new ways to get fossil fuels.

3229
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:44,140
Like that's not the
direction we should be good.

3230
01:42:44,141 --> 01:42:47,440
That's a regressive
direction to go in it like,

3231
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:48,550
like fucking,

3232
01:42:48,850 --> 01:42:52,990
let's work on getting alternative sources
of energy and let's get the fuck off

3233
01:42:52,991 --> 01:42:54,220
of these fossil fuels.

3234
01:42:54,490 --> 01:42:57,130
Let's stop driving these
fucking gas guzzling cars.

3235
01:42:57,131 --> 01:43:02,131
Let's move into a new energy when it
comes to the way that we consume are

3236
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:02,700
true.

3237
01:43:02,700 --> 01:43:03,720
That's easy to say,

3238
01:43:03,721 --> 01:43:07,890
but the real issue is that the situation
we have right now is people are

3239
01:43:07,891 --> 01:43:10,810
operating cars based on fossil
fuels are heating coils.

3240
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:11,913
That's because of the

3241
01:43:11,980 --> 01:43:12,930
well fucking lobby.

3242
01:43:12,931 --> 01:43:14,970
We know this watch who
killed the electric car.

3243
01:43:14,971 --> 01:43:17,550
We have the capability to be able to,

3244
01:43:17,850 --> 01:43:20,580
to move off of fossil
fuels fucking years ago.

3245
01:43:20,581 --> 01:43:22,920
You think the Tesla is
like a new technology?

3246
01:43:22,940 --> 01:43:23,180
Yeah,

3247
01:43:23,180 --> 01:43:27,750
money in the ground is there and once
it's located it becomes a huge issue.

3248
01:43:27,751 --> 01:43:27,850
Right?

3249
01:43:27,850 --> 01:43:29,090
Is a huge commodity because,

3250
01:43:29,290 --> 01:43:29,981
and we also,

3251
01:43:29,981 --> 01:43:31,690
like you were talking about
with corporate welfare,

3252
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:34,030
like who the fuck are we giving
so much corporate welfare too?

3253
01:43:34,270 --> 01:43:35,350
Fucking big oil.

3254
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:36,550
These big energy companies.

3255
01:43:36,551 --> 01:43:39,790
There's some of the biggest lobbies in
this country and they are lining the

3256
01:43:39,791 --> 01:43:43,810
pockets of our politicians
and our politicians are
never going to vote for laws

3257
01:43:44,050 --> 01:43:46,630
that shut them out because then they're
not going to get their beautiful

3258
01:43:46,631 --> 01:43:48,660
corporate sponsorship and they're
not going to win reelection.

3259
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:49,880
Here's a perfect example.

3260
01:43:49,881 --> 01:43:52,370
When was the last time
you ever a politician

3261
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:54,410
say that we should ban cigarettes?

3262
01:43:55,730 --> 01:43:58,640
Cigarettes kill in this
country and this is not fake?

3263
01:43:58,700 --> 01:44:02,810
450,000 people a year.

3264
01:44:03,230 --> 01:44:04,550
That's insane.

3265
01:44:04,850 --> 01:44:09,140
450,000 people just in this country
lower than it used to be because we have

3266
01:44:09,141 --> 01:44:12,980
education and because we had our surgeon
general come out like almost 50 years

3267
01:44:12,981 --> 01:44:14,750
ago and say this is fucking bad for you,

3268
01:44:14,780 --> 01:44:18,380
but could you imagine if there was a
terrorist that killed 450,000 people in

3269
01:44:18,381 --> 01:44:21,950
this country every year and how much we
would be trying to get that terrorist

3270
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:23,780
crime?

3271
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:25,760
11 that was 3,500 people.

3272
01:44:25,820 --> 01:44:26,270
Yeah,

3273
01:44:26,270 --> 01:44:26,751
exactly.

3274
01:44:26,751 --> 01:44:30,080
If there was a food product that
killed 450,000 people every year,

3275
01:44:30,110 --> 01:44:31,820
if there was anything
that killed those numbers,

3276
01:44:32,090 --> 01:44:33,200
it's just dirty money.

3277
01:44:33,230 --> 01:44:37,130
It's just dirty money and everyone turns
a blind eye to it and it's one of the

3278
01:44:37,131 --> 01:44:39,350
great hypocrisy is of our time.

3279
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:40,220
I completely agree.

3280
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:41,320
And cigarettes as you're saying,

3281
01:44:41,330 --> 01:44:43,640
let's say it was like tainted
spinach that did that.

3282
01:44:43,640 --> 01:44:47,030
I don't think I'd be hearing anybody
cry for no regulations after that.

3283
01:44:47,031 --> 01:44:50,150
And that's the problem with
those arguments is that
you make them conveniently

3284
01:44:50,151 --> 01:44:51,830
after some sort of horrible event.

3285
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:52,191
Well,

3286
01:44:52,191 --> 01:44:57,080
the thing about regulations is that you
put money into this and you maintain it

3287
01:44:57,081 --> 01:44:58,430
so that nothing bad happens.

3288
01:44:58,431 --> 01:44:59,990
It's very hard to prove a negative,

3289
01:44:59,991 --> 01:45:00,800
right?

3290
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:02,390
If nothing bad is happening,

3291
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:04,370
that means our regulation is working.

3292
01:45:04,371 --> 01:45:05,690
That's a good thing.

3293
01:45:05,990 --> 01:45:07,460
When bad things happen,

3294
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:10,230
sometimes it happens because
we're under-regulated,

3295
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:13,430
but you don't know it until
people fucking get sick and die.

3296
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:15,500
If people aren't getting sick and dying,

3297
01:45:15,650 --> 01:45:20,120
that means we're actually maintaining
at a good regulatory pace.

3298
01:45:20,330 --> 01:45:22,820
But people don't want
to hear those arguments.

3299
01:45:22,821 --> 01:45:23,870
People want to look at like,

3300
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:24,261
Oh,

3301
01:45:24,261 --> 01:45:25,520
look how inflated our budget is.

3302
01:45:25,521 --> 01:45:27,620
Look at all the money that we're
putting into all of these different

3303
01:45:27,621 --> 01:45:28,454
regulations.

3304
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:29,990
I don't see any effects from it.

3305
01:45:29,991 --> 01:45:30,201
It's like,

3306
01:45:30,201 --> 01:45:30,741
yes you do.

3307
01:45:30,741 --> 01:45:32,570
It's just hard to
measure negative effects.

3308
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:34,160
People aren't dying.

3309
01:45:34,190 --> 01:45:35,023
That's a good thing.

3310
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:38,480
I'm going to switch gears here because
there's one thing they really wanted to

3311
01:45:38,481 --> 01:45:40,460
ask you about this cause we're,

3312
01:45:40,461 --> 01:45:41,450
I know we're almost out of time.

3313
01:45:41,451 --> 01:45:43,490
You got a hard out Fukushima.

3314
01:45:43,530 --> 01:45:44,590
Are you worried about that?

3315
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:45,920
Are you worried about the,

3316
01:45:45,921 --> 01:45:46,070
uh,

3317
01:45:46,070 --> 01:45:46,701
the ocean?

3318
01:45:46,701 --> 01:45:48,380
Are you worried about a fish being,

3319
01:45:50,220 --> 01:45:53,150
I know that there's a lot of pseudoscience
out there and I know that there's a

3320
01:45:53,151 --> 01:45:56,210
lot of good science out there and it's
a very hard to come through and I really

3321
01:45:56,211 --> 01:46:00,200
haven't done my due diligence mostly
because of the new job that I'm doing.

3322
01:46:00,201 --> 01:46:00,890
And you know,

3323
01:46:00,890 --> 01:46:03,260
that the direction that
my career is going.

3324
01:46:03,261 --> 01:46:04,910
If I were still a science writer,

3325
01:46:04,911 --> 01:46:07,880
I would probably know a lot more about
this and I would feel much more competent

3326
01:46:07,881 --> 01:46:08,714
to talk about it.

3327
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:10,550
I definitely have certain,

3328
01:46:10,570 --> 01:46:11,403
uh,

3329
01:46:11,490 --> 01:46:14,120
news outlets and media outlets
that I trust more than others.

3330
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:18,590
And obviously I'm
worried about this spill.

3331
01:46:18,770 --> 01:46:20,060
It's fucking horrible.

3332
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:21,433
I'm,

3333
01:46:21,470 --> 01:46:24,620
I have the luxury of saying I'm not that
worried about tainted fish because I

3334
01:46:24,621 --> 01:46:27,500
don't eat seafood as a
general rule like at all.

3335
01:46:28,250 --> 01:46:28,641
First of all,

3336
01:46:28,641 --> 01:46:29,450
I don't like it,

3337
01:46:29,450 --> 01:46:34,130
but I also have always had concerns about
certain types of toxins that fish can

3338
01:46:34,131 --> 01:46:39,131
carry in a greater quantity
than most domestic animals.

3339
01:46:39,171 --> 01:46:41,360
So you know how you look
at these lists sometimes,

3340
01:46:41,361 --> 01:46:44,030
like if you've ever known somebody who
is pregnant and the doctor will say,

3341
01:46:44,031 --> 01:46:44,181
Oh,

3342
01:46:44,181 --> 01:46:45,500
you can't do this and this and that,

3343
01:46:45,501 --> 01:46:45,641
hey,

3344
01:46:45,641 --> 01:46:46,720
you probably shouldn't eat this then.

3345
01:46:46,910 --> 01:46:47,390
And I'm like,

3346
01:46:47,390 --> 01:46:47,631
well,

3347
01:46:47,631 --> 01:46:50,220
if you're pregnant and you're not
supposed to eat like certain types

3348
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:50,551
of fish,

3349
01:46:50,551 --> 01:46:52,860
maybe probably just don't do it anyway.

3350
01:46:52,861 --> 01:46:54,750
Because if it's harmful for the baby,

3351
01:46:54,751 --> 01:46:57,060
I don't see why it's not
that harmful for you.

3352
01:46:57,520 --> 01:46:58,740
This is the lower concentration,

3353
01:46:58,741 --> 01:46:59,340
but still,

3354
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:00,750
but I also fucking hate seafood.

3355
01:47:00,751 --> 01:47:01,650
I hate the way it tastes.

3356
01:47:01,651 --> 01:47:02,880
I'm not a big fan at all.

3357
01:47:04,470 --> 01:47:05,550
It all tastes the same to me.

3358
01:47:05,730 --> 01:47:09,600
All seafood has this underlying
like briny don't really,

3359
01:47:09,601 --> 01:47:10,434
you're with me?

3360
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:11,610
Yeah.

3361
01:47:11,610 --> 01:47:12,480
Even seaweed,

3362
01:47:12,481 --> 01:47:14,700
I can't eat because it
has this briny like,

3363
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:14,941
Ooh,

3364
01:47:14,941 --> 01:47:16,530
Shinny Yucky taste.

3365
01:47:16,590 --> 01:47:17,251
So,

3366
01:47:17,251 --> 01:47:17,910
um,

3367
01:47:17,910 --> 01:47:19,350
so in that way I'm being selfish.

3368
01:47:19,351 --> 01:47:21,420
Like I don't fucking know
because I'm not eating it.

3369
01:47:21,450 --> 01:47:22,500
But of course,

3370
01:47:22,501 --> 01:47:26,490
I mean nuclear radiation being
dumped into the ocean is dangerous.

3371
01:47:26,670 --> 01:47:29,430
Whether or not it's dangerous
for me it's kind of a moot point.

3372
01:47:29,431 --> 01:47:30,210
Like is it dangerous?

3373
01:47:30,210 --> 01:47:32,160
Dangerous for the ecology of the ocean,

3374
01:47:32,161 --> 01:47:32,940
of course.

3375
01:47:32,940 --> 01:47:35,670
And that fundamentally is
going to affect all of us.

3376
01:47:35,670 --> 01:47:40,670
So I think it's about actually really
doing our research and figuring out like,

3377
01:47:41,131 --> 01:47:45,750
are these scare tactics or is this
like legitimate scientific evidence and

3378
01:47:45,751 --> 01:47:47,090
trying to sort through the bullshit,

3379
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:48,390
which is really hard to do.

3380
01:47:48,391 --> 01:47:48,631
I mean,

3381
01:47:48,631 --> 01:47:51,810
digital media literacy is something that
I think we all need to be armed with.

3382
01:47:51,990 --> 01:47:54,180
Living in a world where we
have so much information,

3383
01:47:55,060 --> 01:47:56,800
how we need regulations,

3384
01:47:57,210 --> 01:47:58,043
God dammit,

3385
01:47:58,060 --> 01:48:01,020
who let them build those fucking
things in the first place,

3386
01:48:01,050 --> 01:48:02,940
knowing that if the power goes out,

3387
01:48:02,941 --> 01:48:03,810
we're doomed.

3388
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:05,220
If the power goes out,

3389
01:48:05,221 --> 01:48:08,820
you're going to create a spot
that you can never cool off,

3390
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,040
that's going to be fucked for
the next hundred thousand.

3391
01:48:11,041 --> 01:48:12,720
You maybe don't put it in a place where,

3392
01:48:12,780 --> 01:48:13,290
uh,

3393
01:48:13,290 --> 01:48:15,650
there's a history of massive tsunamis.

3394
01:48:15,810 --> 01:48:16,101
You know,

3395
01:48:16,101 --> 01:48:16,934
it's like the same thing.

3396
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:19,200
We have different issues
all over this country,

3397
01:48:19,201 --> 01:48:19,411
right?

3398
01:48:19,411 --> 01:48:19,651
I did,

3399
01:48:19,651 --> 01:48:24,090
I did a show for the weather
channel called hacking the
planet and then we did a

3400
01:48:24,091 --> 01:48:27,150
fun kind of spin off of it called the
truth about twisters and they were really

3401
01:48:27,151 --> 01:48:27,480
fun.

3402
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:30,420
And they also helped us realize
that like no matter where you live,

3403
01:48:30,630 --> 01:48:33,510
like Mother Nature could fucking get ya,

3404
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:35,100
but in different ways.

3405
01:48:35,130 --> 01:48:36,030
So you know,

3406
01:48:36,031 --> 01:48:37,320
if you live in tornado alley,

3407
01:48:37,321 --> 01:48:39,330
you have to tornado proof
your infrastructure.

3408
01:48:39,331 --> 01:48:42,630
If you live in a place that's prone to
earthquakes because you're on a fault

3409
01:48:42,631 --> 01:48:42,811
line,

3410
01:48:42,811 --> 01:48:46,650
you have to earthquake proof your
infrastructure and you should think about

3411
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:48,630
building these dangerous things.

3412
01:48:48,631 --> 01:48:50,970
You should think about the
safest places to do it.

3413
01:48:51,150 --> 01:48:56,150
And I don't think that on in a fucking
flood zone on the coast is a good place

3414
01:48:57,631 --> 01:48:59,160
to put a nuclear reactor,

3415
01:48:59,490 --> 01:49:02,790
but they do it all the time because they
want to have that water to cool off.

3416
01:49:03,190 --> 01:49:06,030
The core becomes more convenient.

3417
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:09,180
Convenience and cost effective.

3418
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:12,780
I mean those are words we keep
coming back to mother fucker.

3419
01:49:13,790 --> 01:49:14,121
Kara,

3420
01:49:14,121 --> 01:49:15,620
we can talk for the end of the time.

3421
01:49:16,140 --> 01:49:17,430
It's so much fun over and over again.

3422
01:49:17,431 --> 01:49:17,580
Yeah,

3423
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:18,630
we need to do this more often.

3424
01:49:18,660 --> 01:49:22,020
I'd love to do it was a year and also
I got to say like I'm thinking about

3425
01:49:22,021 --> 01:49:23,160
starting my own podcast.

3426
01:49:23,161 --> 01:49:25,020
I'm very much inspired by you Joe,

3427
01:49:25,021 --> 01:49:28,200
and you know those of you guys who are
listening and who are tweeting and being

3428
01:49:28,201 --> 01:49:28,861
really cool,

3429
01:49:28,861 --> 01:49:30,090
I haven't even had time
to look through them,

3430
01:49:30,091 --> 01:49:31,620
but I'll be doing that
the rest of the day.

3431
01:49:32,620 --> 01:49:32,831
Yeah,

3432
01:49:32,831 --> 01:49:33,400
that's true.

3433
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:34,110
But you know,

3434
01:49:34,110 --> 01:49:37,500
but I would love to get some feedback and
some insights and what kinds of things

3435
01:49:37,501 --> 01:49:38,580
you would want to hear.

3436
01:49:38,670 --> 01:49:39,121
You know,

3437
01:49:39,121 --> 01:49:39,571
I always,

3438
01:49:39,571 --> 01:49:39,960
you know,

3439
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:41,040
if I'm going to start a podcast,

3440
01:49:41,041 --> 01:49:42,090
I'm going to do it for you guys.

3441
01:49:42,091 --> 01:49:43,600
So I want don't do that.

3442
01:49:45,700 --> 01:49:46,830
You're a great talker.

3443
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:47,650
Just talk.

3444
01:49:47,650 --> 01:49:48,040
Just do

3445
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:48,201
it.

3446
01:49:48,201 --> 01:49:48,680
Just do it.

3447
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:48,910
Yeah,

3448
01:49:48,910 --> 01:49:49,470
yeah.

3449
01:49:49,470 --> 01:49:49,920
Yes.

3450
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:51,280
I want to talk to people.

3451
01:49:51,310 --> 01:49:51,610
Well,

3452
01:49:51,610 --> 01:49:52,840
nothing wrong with that as well.

3453
01:49:52,841 --> 01:49:53,081
I mean,

3454
01:49:53,081 --> 01:49:53,950
definitely have a guest,

3455
01:49:53,951 --> 01:49:54,401
but look,

3456
01:49:54,401 --> 01:49:55,450
you're awesome at talking.

3457
01:49:55,451 --> 01:49:58,420
Just get together and talk about
things that you find that interesting.

3458
01:49:58,421 --> 01:50:00,520
I'm gonna quote that to tweet or
I'm going to quote that as a tweet.

3459
01:50:00,521 --> 01:50:00,971
Joe Says,

3460
01:50:00,971 --> 01:50:01,804
I'm awesome at Tom.

3461
01:50:02,420 --> 01:50:03,010
It's,

3462
01:50:03,010 --> 01:50:04,750
it's not hard to do a podcast.

3463
01:50:04,751 --> 01:50:05,100
It's a car.

3464
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:05,280
I mean,

3465
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:05,920
you just did it.

3466
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:06,670
It's so much fun.

3467
01:50:06,670 --> 01:50:07,360
This is a little different.

3468
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:08,171
When I sit here,

3469
01:50:08,171 --> 01:50:09,040
it's like so much fun.

3470
01:50:09,041 --> 01:50:09,880
And I walk away and I'm like,

3471
01:50:09,881 --> 01:50:11,470
why the fuck am I not
doing this more often?

3472
01:50:11,700 --> 01:50:11,890
Yeah,

3473
01:50:11,890 --> 01:50:12,350
well,

3474
01:50:12,350 --> 01:50:13,183
it's also,

3475
01:50:13,430 --> 01:50:14,500
you completely own it.

3476
01:50:15,010 --> 01:50:15,850
100% yours.

3477
01:50:15,851 --> 01:50:16,684
There's no input.

3478
01:50:16,870 --> 01:50:19,330
There's no production company.

3479
01:50:19,331 --> 01:50:21,580
There's no executive network.

3480
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:22,953
There's nothing.

3481
01:50:22,990 --> 01:50:23,171
I mean,

3482
01:50:23,171 --> 01:50:23,381
look,

3483
01:50:23,381 --> 01:50:24,250
you see how easy this is?

3484
01:50:24,251 --> 01:50:26,080
This is going to ridge
reach millions of people.

3485
01:50:26,290 --> 01:50:28,600
We get 9 million downloads a month now.

3486
01:50:29,050 --> 01:50:29,980
It's fucking crazy.

3487
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:30,940
You could,

3488
01:50:30,940 --> 01:50:31,751
you could do that too.

3489
01:50:31,751 --> 01:50:32,450
It's not hard.

3490
01:50:32,450 --> 01:50:34,930
You know the last time
I came on your podcast,

3491
01:50:34,931 --> 01:50:36,610
which was about a little over a year ago,

3492
01:50:36,820 --> 01:50:41,260
I walked away and I got something like
5,000 new Twitter followers from being a

3493
01:50:41,261 --> 01:50:42,820
guest on your podcast,

3494
01:50:42,821 --> 01:50:43,654
not shots.

3495
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:45,280
It's probably going to
be even more this time.

3496
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:45,791
Kara,

3497
01:50:45,791 --> 01:50:47,380
Santa Maria follower on Twitter.

3498
01:50:47,790 --> 01:50:48,623
Let's prove a point.

3499
01:50:48,730 --> 01:50:53,730
Let's see how many we could do a Kara
Santa Maria and your show is one more

3500
01:50:54,431 --> 01:50:55,264
time.

3501
01:50:56,260 --> 01:50:59,770
Right now I'm working on a show
called take part live on pivot TV,

3502
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:00,611
take part,

3503
01:51:00,611 --> 01:51:02,050
live on pivot TV in his pivot.

3504
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:07,200
How widely distributed is that mostly and
I think 40 million homes have directv.

3505
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:08,850
If you have Uverse,

3506
01:51:08,860 --> 01:51:09,900
if you have fires,

3507
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:10,141
you,

3508
01:51:10,141 --> 01:51:12,070
you have a capability.

3509
01:51:12,071 --> 01:51:12,791
If you don't,

3510
01:51:12,791 --> 01:51:14,270
you can go on the website,

3511
01:51:14,290 --> 01:51:19,290
take part.com/live and you can watch
each episode a few hours after it airs

3512
01:51:19,721 --> 01:51:21,430
until the following 24 hours.

3513
01:51:21,430 --> 01:51:25,840
So you can pick up basically each day's
episode the following day until the new

3514
01:51:25,841 --> 01:51:26,591
episode airs.

3515
01:51:26,591 --> 01:51:29,570
So that's pretty cool to
vision impaired people there.

3516
01:51:29,590 --> 01:51:29,861
Yeah.

3517
01:51:29,861 --> 01:51:30,250
Look,

3518
01:51:30,250 --> 01:51:30,461
yeah,

3519
01:51:30,461 --> 01:51:31,211
we're super nerdy.

3520
01:51:31,211 --> 01:51:32,590
Also if you go to my website,

3521
01:51:32,591 --> 01:51:34,480
which is where Joe is
right now on the screen,

3522
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:35,771
my website,

3523
01:51:35,771 --> 01:51:39,040
I have cataloged and archived
every single clip I've ever done.

3524
01:51:39,041 --> 01:51:40,360
So all my podcasts,

3525
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:42,070
all my TV appearances,

3526
01:51:42,071 --> 01:51:43,120
all my internet appearance.

3527
01:51:43,121 --> 01:51:43,450
So,

3528
01:51:43,450 --> 01:51:46,780
so you can click on take part live and
you can see any clip that that's been

3529
01:51:46,781 --> 01:51:47,411
clipped out from that.

3530
01:51:47,411 --> 01:51:47,921
You can click on,

3531
01:51:47,921 --> 01:51:50,580
talk nerdy to me and see all my
old talk nerdy is from huffpost.

3532
01:51:50,590 --> 01:51:51,130
Those are great.

3533
01:51:51,130 --> 01:51:51,491
Yeah,

3534
01:51:51,491 --> 01:51:52,151
I love that.

3535
01:51:52,151 --> 01:51:55,170
That was really to organize your website.

3536
01:51:56,820 --> 01:52:01,420
Squarespace fucking gem fucking

3537
01:52:01,421 --> 01:52:02,320
The I do it all.

3538
01:52:02,321 --> 01:52:03,610
I literally do it all myself.

3539
01:52:03,611 --> 01:52:04,710
You can see uh,

3540
01:52:04,711 --> 01:52:09,400
you know all my young Turks appearances

3542
01:52:11,201 --> 01:52:12,070

3543
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:13,000
We'll do this more often.

3544
01:52:13,060 --> 01:52:15,280
