1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,130
The joe rogan experience,
you're thinking,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,050
I want people to spend 30 40 bucks to
go out and that'd be pissed him off and

3
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:09,420
ruin your night with your wife for a date.
No,

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,330
really end up just trying to make you
laugh. So now it's like, you know it,

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:18,220
it's just so Joe, I can remember back
with you and Mike McCarthy. Yeah,

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,250
it was like who could work the dirtiest?

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,310
You guys would be in the back just dying.

8
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,970
There were nights made,
can't even get high and say,

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,600
let's see if we can walk the room

10
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,070
and I've seen people suck and have a roof,
but I mean women that we'd,

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,560
we'd love that.
Oh my God.

12
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:41,490
I remember one night I was doing great
and I said that let me get fucked up.

13
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:46,491
And I turned on the crowd and then I
felt bad because they will so upset.

14
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,620
So discuss with him and he's like,
regulars usually come.

15
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,650
I started trying to win him
back with a bank I took,

16
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:54,630
took me an hour and a half
just to get them back.

17
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,100
But there was another dude
I showed I'll head over.

18
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:00,270
There was a guy heckle him and I
said, listen, if you don't shut up,

19
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:04,110
I'm going to come down here puppy
right in the fucking face. And I did.

20
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,310
I went and went off the stage and up this
fucking guy where he was bleeding and

21
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:11,640
I mean,
and the crowd was on his son.

22
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,810
He's attacking us and it took me
45 minutes just to break even,

23
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,340
you know? And then you kept going after
you punched the guy in the face. Yeah.

24
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,770
That's amazing. You didn't know.
No God. Alando I don't know why.

25
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,500
I know it wasn't linear. It was, you know,

26
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,140
I was doing a bunch of one
night isn't it with and I was,

27
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,730
because the crowd was a big crowd,

28
00:01:35,731 --> 00:01:39,300
but it's been like 300 people and they
all love being away and this guy just,

29
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,000
and I fucking hate it. I wouldn't
write a, put the mic down,

30
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,760
Bang went off and he went down.
He was screaming and crying. Wow.

31
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,990
And I went up in a bipolar, that's
the difference in Boston and Orlando.

32
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,270
But you didn't think that he was lying?

33
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,240
I suspected he wasn't
telling us the whole truth,

34
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:04,040
but I thought he made some interesting
points in Alpha to Alfred had was a

35
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,990
pitcher in high school,
North Miami Beach,

36
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:10,940
senior high go chargers and Alfred had
actually pitched against Alex Rodriguez.

37
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:15,680
This is like one of his only more stories
from his baseball years in high school,

38
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:18,620
right is that Alex was
a senior at the Alpha,

39
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:22,190
was going to some sort of Ron Frasier,
a baseball camp,

40
00:02:22,191 --> 00:02:26,150
had a u m and they did the
summer league game and Alfred,

41
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,270
this is my eyes are glazing
over telling the story,

42
00:02:29,271 --> 00:02:34,130
but like Alfred Alfred pitches against
a ride and who was already a senior

43
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,530
already a beast.
Everybody knew this guy was going to,

44
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,950
was going to go in the draft and be huge.
Everybody knew about that.

45
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,940
He had been the talk of the high school
baseball community in Miami forever and

46
00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:48,680
so Alfred pitched against him
and he held a rod to a triple.

47
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,800
Of course, Alec, you know a red smacked
the shit out of this ball, sailed away,

48
00:02:51,801 --> 00:02:54,980
but he alphabet, he was, it was only
a triple. It wasn't, it was a rare,

49
00:02:54,981 --> 00:02:59,210
not home run for Alex. So I thought, oh,
we have like a funny personal anecdote.

50
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,240
Like we can find some common ground here,
right?

51
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:04,180
You're talking to someone who might be
a potential interview subject, you know?

52
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:06,670
And so I'm like,
actually Alex,

53
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,220
you and Alfred have met
before Alpha rolls his eyes.

54
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:11,950
Like he's going to embarrass me
and tell this dumb shit story.

55
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,690
So I tell out like,
isn't this funny?

56
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,720
Like you guys met and Alfred held you
to a triple and he kind of looked at me

57
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:21,310
like, you're looking at
me right now. He's just,

58
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,640
he was totally on amused and maybe
looked even a little hurt or offended.

59
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,070
Oh Wow.
This is the greatest baseball,

60
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:31,540
one of the greatest baseball
players of all time,

61
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,970
the highest paid baseball
player in history.

62
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,770
And here I'm just telling this cute story
from like 20 years earlier or whatever.

63
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,880
And he seemed like I held me to a triple.
I'm like,

64
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:45,280
how could you be upset about that?

65
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:48,930
You one of the greatest of all time super
winners, but it's like, yeah, it's the,

66
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,950
it's, it's, that's why I left. I was like,

67
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:54,250
this guy's a really interesting character.
Like he's a complicated guy.

68
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:57,880
He's an interesting guy. He's a sensitive
guy. Like I was curious about him.

69
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:01,780
I was excited about the prospect
of interviewing him and man,

70
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,380
they practically ghosted us
out. Yeah. The January of 2014,

71
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,540
that's when they lowered,
they reduce the suspension.

72
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,040
I started hitting up every month.

73
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,480
I started hitting up the publicists yo
following up on that meeting. You know,

74
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:13,961
cause it's funny,

75
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:17,140
in the page six article it mentioned
he met with the 30 for 30 filmmakers,

76
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:18,520
Billy Corbin output Spellman.
Uh,

77
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:21,430
he's been shopping a book
proposal to these publishers.

78
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,650
The book proposal thing was total
bunk. Literally not true. The, the,

79
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,400
the publishers were like,
we'd love to get one,

80
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,530
but we haven't gotten a
book proposal from a Rod.

81
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:32,260
He really did have the meeting with
us. But like, so everything was just,

82
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,840
we were just kind of pawns in his game,
which is cool.

83
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:38,590
Whatever they respond to this documentary.
Not exactly,

84
00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:41,380
but I for only six or seven months,

85
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,990
I'm emailing with the publicist and
then it was clear that they weren't

86
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,470
interested. So, and that
became the tactic. By the way,

87
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,440
when you said was there a strategy,
the strategy was to shut the fuck up.

88
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,260
We have evidence again in the
archaeological records of,

89
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,620
of surgical procedures going far back.
But who did them?

90
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,710
They would have been um,
you know, sometimes why they
call them wise women comedy.

91
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:06,490
Connie women on marver
surgeons. So one of my, yeah,

92
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,100
with the barber, I guess they're
good razors, right? Yes. Yeah.

93
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,730
Actually Barbara surgeons used to
do things like pull your teeth.

94
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:16,120
They used to blood, sweat.
And so the Barber Pole,

95
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:20,200
which is right in white is right and
white because it was advertising their

96
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,470
services is blood letters.
So what they would do,

97
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,110
they would tie these bloody rags around
the pole and it would whip around the

98
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:30,520
pole. I know it's one of my
favorite stories. And, um,

99
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,151
and the,

100
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:35,140
the ball at the top represented the
bowl that would catch the blood and the

101
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:38,500
stick would have been the stick that you
held to kind of get your veins to stick

102
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:40,630
out and people were blood
let for all kinds of reasons.

103
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,180
Like you would do it like
a purge or a diet or,

104
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,880
or you would do it because you were ill.
Um,

105
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,450
the idea being that you had produced too
much blood and you needed the blood to

106
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:52,180
be let to kind of restore
balance in your body.

107
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,430
What do you think it would be like to
go back in time and hear someone say

108
00:05:55,431 --> 00:05:58,130
something that's stupid?
Like, you're sick.

109
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,760
We need to remove some of your glove.
Do you have too much blood in your system?

110
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:05,930
Z show you're going to send all of these
like crazy academic historians are like,

111
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:10,670
we can't. Yeah, there you go.
There Tom Sorial services.

112
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:13,370
What does that mean?
And you know what else?

113
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:17,960
The barber shop quartet comes from the
idea that the barber surgeons often had a

114
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:22,040
musical loot in the office that you
would play or the patient would play.

115
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:26,060
It was like a musical therapy. Um, so
there's all kinds of hangovers from it.

116
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,380
And you know, the demon barber, a
Sweeney Todd. Yeah. So this is kind of a,

117
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,860
one of these stories that pops up and
they think that it might be that medical

118
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:38,861
practitioners were trying to undermine
the legitimacy of the barbers.

119
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,600
So you kind of either get
this story that the barber,

120
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:45,410
is this like sort of demon figure who's
chopping you up in selling you and

121
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:47,840
making you into pies?
Or

122
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,000
is that a legit one?
Because that seems like nonsense.

123
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,130
Well it seems like it's a recreation of,

124
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,740
it's an older one cause well it
seems like parody, like look says,

125
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,520
listen to my troubles. No charge.
Listen to your troubles. 50 cents.

126
00:06:59,521 --> 00:07:00,480
They might've had that on there.

127
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,660
Barbered thing when they're
cutting bolts out of you,

128
00:07:03,661 --> 00:07:07,080
it's this bullets removed two bucks. I
don't know. They're all drunk. Pomade,

129
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,310
mustache wax.

130
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,350
Yeah. People, people thought that bullets
were, uh, that gunpowder was poisonous.

131
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:17,080
So a surgeon would often amputate
if you were shot. Oh God.

132
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,510
Until they kind of realize that sometimes
it was okay to just keep the bullet in.

133
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:27,850
I am a firm believer that many of us who
are feeling really good about life and

134
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:31,200
having a great time here are v very,

135
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:35,720
very lucky in their
circumstance. Very lucky in, in,

136
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:40,230
in the people you're around,
the positive influences in your life,

137
00:07:40,231 --> 00:07:41,190
the good things,

138
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:46,250
very lucky cause shit can be really not
good and when things are really not good

139
00:07:46,321 --> 00:07:47,580
and people go down the spiral,

140
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:52,850
whether it's with booze and cigarettes
and heroin or whether it's with food or

141
00:07:53,521 --> 00:07:56,610
whether it's with alcohol or
whether it's whatever, the pills,

142
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,230
if you can go down a spiral,

143
00:07:58,231 --> 00:08:03,231
it's who out of the person that is in
the bottom of the spiral who can pull

144
00:08:03,931 --> 00:08:06,120
themselves out.
Could you,

145
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:09,180
if you had to start from there instead
of starting from a place of success,

146
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,450
and this is why I think people get cocky.
You wake up every morning like, oh,

147
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:15,420
I guess everything's okay.
You know my lifestyle and the share.

148
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:20,310
Instead think of what it would be like
if you woke up and you were 380 pounds

149
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,780
and this is your new life.

150
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,900
Your new life is you got to get down
from 380 pounds to about 220 pounds.

151
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,560
You got to figure out how to do that
and you've got to figure out how to not

152
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:36,060
lapse. When you're aching with hunger.
You got to figure out how, how your, your,

153
00:08:36,061 --> 00:08:38,850
your body has no fucking energy.
It doesn't know how to recover.

154
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,780
It never gets pushed.

155
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,960
And you have to push it through that and
you have to do that to the tune of 160

156
00:08:45,751 --> 00:08:49,260
pounds. It's a lot of fucking weight, man.

157
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,740
That's a lot of fucking
weight. Most people are not
going to be able to do that.

158
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,180
It's a lot of weight to lose.
How long that take you? Um,

159
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,890
about how two and a half years.
That's a,

160
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,090
no matter what, that's an
accomplishment, man. You know?

161
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:11,220
And it's something that I think that
when people hear that, that you did,

162
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:13,770
that people realize like,
I can do that too.

163
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,390
And, uh, you wondering why
were these crazy Greeks put
pine resin in there ruining

164
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,840
perfectly good white wine. And then
after a while you start to say, Hey,

165
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:25,260
actually this is pretty good. Uh, you
know, this is not a crazy thing after all.

166
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:28,650
And you acquired case run resident
and there were walls. Yes. You know,

167
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:33,570
the first time, the first time
I had scotch whiskey, I, I,

168
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:37,080
uh, I didn't know what I thought about
it. And now I love whiskey. Right.

169
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,200
It's an acquired taste. So the first
time you drink something like that,

170
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:43,320
you think, you know, yes. They put resin,
they put pine resin in their white wine.

171
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:45,060
The chill it.
I should have brought you some,

172
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:48,270
maybe I'll send you on an acquired taste.
Ouzo Koolaid.

173
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,740
It's delicious from the beginning.
Yeah. I just write out cold.

174
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,550
It's a sweet good. Yes, yes, yes.

175
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,450
We'll have to convince anybody.
Yes, that's right. That's right.

176
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:01,650
Some things that's right.

177
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:04,410
Some things are just good right
out of the budget is good. Yes.

178
00:10:04,411 --> 00:10:07,680
Koolaid is just good. Yeah. I mean, I
don't recommend you drink it all the time.

179
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:10,860
It's full of sugar. It's terrible for
you, but damn, that stuff tastes good.

180
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,660
It's like, it's like a, it's like
fried foods, you know? Yeah. Yummy.

181
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,500
A lot of them French fries. Yes. I mean,
come on man. Salt and catch up like that.

182
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,390
How can you know?
I'm uh,

183
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,060
I'm not sure about what I should mention,
but anyway,

184
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,050
I love Popeye's fried chicken. Can I do
as well? I love it so bad. It's awful.

185
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:35,030
It's my wife. My wife is unlikely to
listen to this full podcast, so, or I'll,

186
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,470
I'll skip over this part so
she doesn't hear this part but,

187
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,690
and my sister will be listening probably
and so she will laugh when she gets to

188
00:10:41,691 --> 00:10:46,691
this part because whenever I see my eyes
I just pull over and indulge myself and

189
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:50,430
then I terrible. Terrible. It's
awful. This is good. You know what,

190
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:55,431
if you really want to indulge and
you like chicken Roscoe's in La,

191
00:10:55,441 --> 00:10:59,880
I have it. No, you don't know. Oh, I
don't know. Ascos chicken and waffles.

192
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,830
Oh Dude. I tried to go the chicken
and waffle family. We tried.

193
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:08,090
Don't you make that tried to go there
the other day with my family and a half.

194
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:12,810
Wait on the same place. Sunday chicken
and walls course on the same plate.

195
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,720
What are you a communist? Yeah, man,

196
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,070
it's La Syrup and butter.
Yeah.

197
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:23,670
You mean put it on
there? Yes. It perfectly.

198
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:28,710
It's not damn delicious in my
mind yet from another pant I,

199
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,040
I make maple syrup.
I live in Vermont and I make Maple Syrup.

200
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:35,700
I tap my own trees and wow. What a
freak I have. I have a yeah, exactly.

201
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:38,720
Even people hard time for waffles
and chicken again. Exactly what is,

202
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:43,080
show me the colonel. The
colonel is a liar. He does
not have it. Get out of here.

203
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:47,470
It's not even the colonel, the
colonel's norm Macdonald. I saw a

204
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,570
promotion or something that this is
yeah, but they do not, oh my gosh.

205
00:11:55,571 --> 00:11:59,700
I walk from the syrup goes on top of
the chicken. That chicken and wild,

206
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,040
that waffles and chicken tastes like
cat litter compared to Roscoe's is also

207
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:07,580
sweet chick La. He could try to
get this out of here. Uh, so, uh,

208
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,850
it's stuff can go fuck off.
Roscoe's chicken and waffles. Okay,

209
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,100
so you get the Greens to the Collard
Greens, Collard Greens. Yeah, that's fine.

210
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,710
Damn good. That's fine. But
that's a waste of maple syrup.

211
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,380
Take it from a man who makes it up to
put it on a show. Me a chick is good.

212
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:24,250
I'm source sweets. It's not as as place.
I get it. I love it. I've been there.

213
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:27,220
It's great. Roscoe's okay. Fuck off.

214
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,090
There's a reason why there's an hour
and a half wait on a Sunday. Okay.

215
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,610
How long you in town for a just a day.
Maybe I'll be back though.

216
00:12:33,611 --> 00:12:36,070
I'll be back over there
right after the show.

217
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,390
Maybe I'll go there for a
little one on Gower. Okay.
Ooh Man. It's good. All right.

218
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,240
Maybe I'll try that. It's so good,
but it's also one of those places.

219
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:45,100
It's been there forever.
We used to get it.

220
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:49,480
I found out about it from 19 or
1994 when I was doing news radio.

221
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:54,040
95 ish, I guess. Have you been in La
since you left the Massachusetts? No,

222
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,080
I went to New York for a couple of years,
then I moved down here,

223
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,510
moved down here in [inaudible] 94 okay,
so you've been here a long time. Yeah.

224
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,390
And when I was on news radio,
they got it for like you,

225
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:04,840
you can order lunch and someone
ordered Roscoe street became addicted.

226
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:06,910
And I was like,
what is this like waffles?

227
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,310
And it was just like you waffles and
chicken there. It looks. That's, that's,

228
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:12,550
that's doesn't look as good
as it looks when you're there.

229
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:16,380
When you're there and you smell
it. It's damn good. I'm doing a,

230
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,820
Roscoe is commercial here.
That's an incredible, I'm a fan.

231
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,960
That's an incredible
combination of items to say, oh,

232
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,970
it's so good. And afterwards you
better have nothing to do, man. Yeah.

233
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:31,840
Going into a food coma son. Anyway. Um,

234
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,990
how do we get to that?
W W I don't know.

235
00:13:33,991 --> 00:13:36,180
I was going to tell you
maple syrup stories. Oh yeah.

236
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,810
Going to different countries,

237
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:40,150
different countries and opening
your mind so you raise it. Yeah.

238
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:45,151
So you are counteracting my resin flavored
white wine with the Maple Syrup Syrup

239
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:46,840
and grass chicken.
