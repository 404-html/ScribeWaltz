1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,070
The joe rogan experience showing by day
Joe Rogan podcast by nine.

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:15,470
Austin's one of them is a drug addled
shit.

3
00:00:15,471 --> 00:00:20,471
All the other ones in Texas.
We're here about 10 miles outside of

4
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,140
Austin,
Nevada.

5
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:27,670
I'm with my good friend Dan Dodi.
Hello.

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,370
Hello.
Say Hello.

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,730
Hello.
We just got back from uh,

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,100
we allowed to say unsuccessful until it
hits the air.

9
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,240
Yeah,
I think Sylvia and six belt successful

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,720
in memories and fun.
We had a wonderful time chasing

11
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:45,420
unsuspecting undulates with sharp pointy
sticks.

12
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,560
It did not work out.
That means we're bow hunting for deer.

13
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,910
It did not work out.
Dan Dodi is a,

14
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,340
hey,
you are a fucking renaissance man,

15
00:00:56,341 --> 00:00:58,190
my friend.
You're a,

16
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,590
an undercover hippie on a hunting show.
You're a man of a great fast,

17
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,330
wide range of experiences and um,
Dan is a work for a mediator for 65

18
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:17,640
episodes.
This is my 65th episode shooting the

19
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:19,640
show at.
Dan's been on the podcast before with

20
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,650
Remy Warren back when he and remy were,
I'm releasing that apex predators show,

21
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:27,330
which is excellent show.

22
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,160
I guess they're not doing it anymore.
Uh,

23
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:33,300
if you hear noise cause we're driving,
we're on the road right now and uh,

24
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:36,180
we're,
we're passing through some fucking

25
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:41,181
strange shit.
We're a about 150 miles or so outside

26
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,830
arena,
I think one 70 outside of Reno,

27
00:01:43,831 --> 00:01:45,640
Nevada.
And um,

28
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,740
we,
we just saw so much strangeness today.

29
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,750
This is lonely country,
man,

30
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,400
lonely country.
I was a lot of,

31
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,470
what do you call it?
Desert,

32
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,180
desert rats,
desert rats,

33
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,030
all these people there,
no offense if you're one of them

34
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:02,580
listening to this podcast right now,
I'm sure you're wonderful people.

35
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,260
Lots of four wheelers,
lots of side by sides,

36
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,330
lots of long,
weird haircuts,

37
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,840
weird haircuts.
Like they just,

38
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,350
it gets to a certain point all man ago.
Go to cut the end.

39
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:19,070
They just free.
No is reno is fucking metropolis

40
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,770
compared to this.
And I've always thought of Reno's being

41
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:24,960
that one of those weird places I really
don't want to go to.

42
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,910
But um,
no offense,

43
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:28,320
if you're from Reno and you're listening
to this,

44
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:30,860
if that is is,
it's a bigger state than I thought and

45
00:02:30,861 --> 00:02:33,470
it's,
it's as empty as anything.

46
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,820
You know what the game means?
What does gaming does that mean the,

47
00:02:36,821 --> 00:02:38,910
so yeah,
it's like how much it's amplifying the

48
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:41,550
sound that's coming.
So if I crank it up way high,

49
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,840
it's probably too hot.
Yeah,

50
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:43,950
it's making a red.
It's like,

51
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:44,730
bitch,
what are you doing?

52
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,100
There's a clipping going red,
that means it's too much.

53
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,000
Or I'll leave it right there so jamie
can handle this and Jamie knows how to

54
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:51,781
do it.
This is a new thing.

55
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:55,610
I think I picked up,
it's called an apogee microphone cause

56
00:02:55,611 --> 00:03:00,611
some people were complaining about the
sound quality of my ipod or iphone

57
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,800
recorded podcasts and someone from my
message board recommended this is pretty

58
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:06,250
dope.

59
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,650
I like how it hooks up.
Just hooks it up right to the base of

60
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:10,380
your iphones.
And um,

61
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,180
this might be the future.
This is really your first time.

62
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,040
Yeah.
This is the first time Dan duty.

63
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,510
You're,
you're the one who's breaking into in

64
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,310
sounds good.
So,

65
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:19,780
um,
we are about,

66
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,630
we're,
we were about five miles,

67
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:26,440
or excuse me,
five hours outside of Reno in this

68
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:31,441
incredibly beautiful,
desolate landscape chasing these deer

69
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,400
that have these ears that they're there.
Fuck,

70
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:40,870
there's biggest Kim Kardashians ass and
they fucking here everything,

71
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,180
these animals here,
everything.

72
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,830
And Dan and I,
Dan was behind me with the camera and I

73
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:48,664
was,
uh,

74
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,530
being a clumsy,
sneaky fuck,

75
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,950
trying to sneak up on these things and
it just didn't work out.

76
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:55,800
But God damn,
it was fun trying to do,

77
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,460
we got clothes,
we got some good stuff.

78
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,770
Yeah.
I got so close that it could have

79
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:01,600
happened once one time.

80
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,350
It legitimately could have happened the
time we got kind of close a few times.

81
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,620
But one time I got inside of 30 yards
and as I was crawling towards them in

82
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:14,020
the bushes,
I made too much noise and they'd got up

83
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:15,370
and bolted.
But,

84
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:17,770
um,
there's two deer that were in,

85
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,140
ah,
this is too many,

86
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,150
too many details and catch it on the
show.

87
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,790
It's called meet.
Either it's on sportsman channel.

88
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,380
It's an excellent show.
But,

89
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:27,490
uh,
this,

90
00:04:27,491 --> 00:04:30,100
uh,
this fucking trip has been really

91
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:31,090
interesting.
First of all,

92
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:34,660
it's nice to be off the grid for seven
days.

93
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:36,940
I haven't done that in awhile.
God Damn,

94
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:37,774
that feels good.

95
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:44,260
When was the last time you did that?
Probably last time I hung with you guys.

96
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,310
Probably Prince of Wales Moon with that
was,

97
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,120
that was not quite a year ago.
Yeah,

98
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,490
it was miserable.
I was less or more miserable than,

99
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,500
Oh,
this is way more fun.

100
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,890
Way Better Mrs just hot.
But I don't mind he,

101
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,650
he doesn't really bug me as long as we
have water.

102
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:02,680
We had plenty of water.
I mean you just keep your skin covered.

103
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:03,514
So,
you know,

104
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,680
burst into flames.
Yeah,

105
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:06,700
I have,
uh,

106
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,930
I've done a lot of these mediators,
but I haven't been doing them lately.

107
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,250
The last year,
and this is the first time I've been off

108
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:14,500
grid and
I don't know,

109
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:16,420
a good long time too.
And it felt amazing.

110
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,160
The first three days just felt like a
vacation.

111
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,170
Yeah.
Well it made me realize like we're so

112
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:27,410
addicted to taking in information,
at least I am.

113
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,820
I shouldn't say wheat.
I'm so addicted to checking the news and

114
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:34,000
finding out what's going on in the world
and we just,

115
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,520
it's,
it's a lot of times,

116
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:41,890
doesn't give you a chance to use your
brain and think about what you actually

117
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:44,380
feel about things.
Like you don't get a chance.

118
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:49,410
You're just so wrapped up in it.
Paying attention to all the news and all

119
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:54,340
the information and all the stuff that's
being fed to you constantly through the

120
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:56,980
media,
through social media networks,

121
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,700
you know,
all the,

122
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,530
just everything.
It's just too much.

123
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:05,120
I tried to keep my phone off for four
hours at a time during the days,

124
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,700
even if I'm working.
That's nice.

125
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,270
Just try to shut and put it on airplane
mode,

126
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,450
put it away,
and just step away from it as much as I

127
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:12,201
can.
Well,

128
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:15,410
my friend Ari got it right.
I can't do what he did,

129
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:17,750
but what he did was he switched to a
flip phone.

130
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,730
A smart,
yeah.

131
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:20,643
Well,
sue said,

132
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,480
enough said enough.
I can't do it.

133
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,580
I need it.
I like having the phone.

134
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:27,260
First of all,
if I had a flip phone,

135
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:30,710
it wouldn't be recording a podcast right
now cause I need a fucking iphone for

136
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:31,970
that.
Because the first thing you do in the

137
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:32,900
morning,
do you wake up,

138
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,230
you check your phone.
Sometimes it shouldn't,

139
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,600
but sometimes I did.
But it is for me using it,

140
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:40,040
man,
you can't help it.

141
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,770
I try not to.
What I've been trying to do lately,

142
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:45,700
I checked my phone to make sure nothing
important is going on like a,

143
00:06:45,701 --> 00:06:49,640
I'll look at my text messages,
make sure that they're okay.

144
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,330
Nothing's crazy.
No one,

145
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,470
no nine one one calls or something.
And then uh,

146
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,990
then I just try to start my day.
But I used to,

147
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,570
I used to do it.
I used to hit it hard for like an hour

148
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,900
check the news,
check all the bullshit,

149
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,010
check my twitter feed,
check all the lakes people post me,

150
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,110
check what I'm supposed to be doing,
check this,

151
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:09,944
check that.

152
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,650
I don't,
I try to do that anymore.

153
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,050
Yeah,
I spent a fair amount of time off the

154
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:18,860
grid and in this connected like that
through the past 10 years.

155
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,860
It's,
it's a weird kind of addiction because

156
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:23,990
it's a,
I think that's what I felt so when we

157
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:26,030
got out here,
it had been a long time since I'd been

158
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:27,470
offered,
but we got out here and it was like,

159
00:07:27,471 --> 00:07:29,360
Holy Shit,
this is great.

160
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,250
It's good,
it's quiet.

161
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,500
I think we're doing something weird to
ourselves by constantly being connected

162
00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:41,000
to everything and everyone and
everyone's terrified to be disconnected,

163
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,920
terrified to take a week off of just
nothing coming in,

164
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:48,410
but your own thoughts,
the world,

165
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:50,600
the actual world that you see in front
of your face,

166
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,660
which is not what we get a lot of times
I haven't,

167
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,700
I've been talking about that a lot is
that there's a real problem with getting

168
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:03,701
all the bummer news from 7 billion
people all over the world because you

169
00:08:04,821 --> 00:08:08,960
get a distorted perception of what's
going on in the world because you're,

170
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,820
you're connected to everything that's
happening all the time,

171
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:15,860
24 seven,
anytime,

172
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,020
anytime anything fucked up goes down.

173
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,830
You hear about it instantly and it just
gives you this,

174
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,270
this feeling that the world has fallen
apart.

175
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,750
But meanwhile,
most of the time nothing is happening

176
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:28,790
where most people are.
It's the pre,

177
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,250
pre iphones or pre these kinds of
phones.

178
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,740
I,
I really did disconnect from,

179
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,690
from news.
I wouldn't watch news.

180
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:36,760
I didn't have a TV.
I do.

181
00:08:36,761 --> 00:08:39,010
Nick didn't do all that,
but I,

182
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,330
there's no active claim that anymore and
there's no way that,

183
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,360
I don't know how it would extract myself
from that stream of information now

184
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,460
because it's just,
it is everywhere.

185
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,650
I mean you can't,
you can't open one web browser or

186
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:54,260
anything without seeing anything.
So I,

187
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,010
I dunno,
I have a

188
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,510
hard time with it.
I really do.

189
00:08:57,511 --> 00:08:59,030
I don't,
I don't like to know.

190
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,120
And now I actually,
lately I feel responsible.

191
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,850
Lately I feel more responsible that I do
need to know.

192
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,610
I don't know.
I think it's about managing it,

193
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:11,490
man.
I think that's the big thing is managing

194
00:09:11,491 --> 00:09:12,480
it.
Don't you know,

195
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:15,750
you don't have to completely disconnect
yourself from the world,

196
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,290
but just connect sometimes and you know,
and,

197
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,220
and know when you're getting too much.
Like I'll go down those,

198
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,770
you ever go down one of those youtube
rabbit holes?

199
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,480
We watch one video on big foot.
I see.

200
00:09:30,481 --> 00:09:33,000
No,
it's four hours later.

201
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,980
He was like,
what the fuck just happened?

202
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,680
Interviewed,
you've watched several people get eaten

203
00:09:37,681 --> 00:09:40,200
by crocodiles.
And I watched this thing,

204
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:44,550
the top crocodile attacks of 2016.
And I'm like,

205
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,890
what the fuck is wrong with me?
Why am I watching this?

206
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,570
There are good ones.
Oh man,

207
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,370
really good ones.
It's awful.

208
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:55,200
It's just awful to support assholes.
So it's a noisy,

209
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:57,180
it's noisy life.
It's a busy life.

210
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:01,060
And to me it's almost,
it's the business that I can second more

211
00:10:01,061 --> 00:10:05,580
than anything else.
It's a constant pushing it to everything

212
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:07,680
that's going on to the,
whether it's for a hunter,

213
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:09,420
for whatever reason of getting
disconnected.

214
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,600
That is the part that I,
um,

215
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:13,881
I dunno it,
that,

216
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:16,560
that that's what light that lights me up
and makes me happy just to,

217
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,970
just to fucking settle down.
Like don't have things to do always.

218
00:10:21,971 --> 00:10:24,120
And always be going somewhere,
always doing something.

219
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:27,990
And I try to live a pretty relaxed life
anyway,

220
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,210
but I mean it seems too busy.
Well,

221
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:32,750
you were taken into a whole nother level
this weekend.

222
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,650
You were talking about one day one and
to go to the mountain by yourself for 40

223
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:38,370
days.

224
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,780
I would,
I would love to do that.

225
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,790
Yeah,
that would,

226
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:45,180
I'm sure I will do it.
I do a lot of meditation and then in the

227
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:48,600
lineage of meditation that I do,
there's a lot of a solo practice are

228
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:52,650
basically solo retreat where you go
either in a cabin or out of the woods or

229
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:54,750
whatever you or whatever you want to do
and you just,

230
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,030
you just,
you're just there by yourself doing your

231
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:00,180
thing.
And I have not had a chance to do that

232
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:01,680
recently.
I also used to,

233
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,100
when I used to be a wilderness guide and
it would run programs for people,

234
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,770
they would always do a solo at the end
of their wilderness experience to sit

235
00:11:08,771 --> 00:11:11,070
down in the woods all alone by
themselves,

236
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:12,120
four days,
six days,

237
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,640
whatever it was.
Yeah,

238
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:15,171
man,
it's,

239
00:11:15,171 --> 00:11:17,430
it's a weird thing.
It's not something I think that most

240
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:18,420
people are drawn to.

241
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,270
I don't think it's a type of thing that,
that um,

242
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,880
you know,
I think it is a weird thing for people

243
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:26,760
in our culture,
but I think there's something massively

244
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:31,700
valuable to be gained by that just self
now and self experience.

245
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,360
Just this reflection.
Oh yeah,

246
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,120
yeah.
Well reflection but then also

247
00:11:36,121 --> 00:11:38,190
exploration I think,
you know,

248
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,230
have your own thoughts.
Yeah man.

249
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:44,280
And like what's actually there?
Like what's really inside you?

250
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:44,731
What,
what,

251
00:11:44,731 --> 00:11:46,310
what really,
you know,

252
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,400
disconnected from all the input of
information and the need to go and do

253
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:53,980
stuff and the need to say stuff but just
like fucking be

254
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,330
there with what's going on with,
yeah.

255
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,690
Yeah.
You know,

256
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,690
I'm a big fan of a,
the isolation tank and you and I have

257
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:03,200
talked about that.
But uh,

258
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,950
one of the things that's weird is when I
tell people about it,

259
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,100
they,
I've had many people says to me,

260
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,450
Oh,
I don't want to be alone with my

261
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:11,470
thoughts.
Like,

262
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:12,790
oh no.
Yeah,

263
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,380
you don't want to be alone with your
thoughts.

264
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,940
You want to know how you really feel
about things and explore whether or not

265
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,350
you're right about things are wrong or
whether or not you have a bias or

266
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:25,840
whether or not you have some sort of
preconceived notion.

267
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,780
You know,
one of the things that I've found that a

268
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:33,781
lot of people do is they have an opinion
on something and then when confronted

269
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:37,540
with new evidence,
they do their damnest to try to defend

270
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,380
that original opinion.
Dig again.

271
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,740
Yeah.
They could do it again and they fucked

272
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:44,620
themselves.
You gotta be able to be flexible with

273
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:46,450
your,
your ideas or not you.

274
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,353
Yeah,
man.

275
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:48,920
Totally.
And so,

276
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,990
yeah.
So the idea of like going out to

277
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,880
mountain and being there,
to me it's about,

278
00:12:52,881 --> 00:12:57,881
I think there's a disconnect in our
culture from the actual experience and

279
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,250
however you want to say that.
Your actual physical experience that

280
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:06,010
you're having in the moment,
the actual emotional experience or the

281
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:11,060
even even mental experience.
I think that there's so much controlling

282
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:12,890
us,
you know,

283
00:13:12,891 --> 00:13:15,680
we control ourselves or other things.
All the other forces control us.

284
00:13:15,681 --> 00:13:20,450
But the actual sitting in what's
actually happening is to me the most

285
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,680
compelling,
uh,

286
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,670
part of being alive.
And I think there's a lot of ways that

287
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,050
people go about doing that.
Uh,

288
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,900
but it is challenging and it's not,
it's not something that,

289
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,070
yeah,
you're right.

290
00:13:34,071 --> 00:13:35,270
People,
it scares the shit out.

291
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:35,840
You know?
Why?

292
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,550
Because it is scary.
I think it's,

293
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,720
it's,
it's intense life.

294
00:13:38,721 --> 00:13:40,280
Some tense,
you know,

295
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,780
so you actually have to confront what
life is when,

296
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,210
when nothing else,
you know,

297
00:13:45,211 --> 00:13:47,880
when,
when you're really just thinking alone

298
00:13:47,881 --> 00:13:49,720
by yourself,
nothing else is occupying thoughts,

299
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,140
not a television show,
not an album.

300
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,330
You're a law.
And those things are great too,

301
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,360
but to be alone with your thoughts.

302
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,130
Totally.
And I actually,

303
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,800
and I think it extends to,
to being with other people too.

304
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:06,280
Like if I think there is something to be
practicing,

305
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:08,800
being able to be present in the
experience that's happening.

306
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:11,110
Right.
And I think that different spiritual

307
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:13,720
traditions are searching for that thing,
different,

308
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:19,330
all kinds of different things that
people do to try to feel better and do

309
00:14:19,331 --> 00:14:20,470
better at life.
And,

310
00:14:20,471 --> 00:14:21,250
um,
so yeah,

311
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,160
the practice of doing it yourself I
think is one thing.

312
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,620
And then,
um,

313
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,960
I think an even more challenging thing
is sort of that sort of,

314
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,790
uh,
rodness or,

315
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:34,300
or,
or simplicity or even connection with

316
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,510
somebody else presidencies even fucking
harder.

317
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:41,520
So I actually think it opens up with a
way of living life that is a,

318
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,580
I dunno,
fascinating and really exciting.

319
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,980
Yeah.
And an important point about being alone

320
00:14:47,981 --> 00:14:49,900
too,
because when you're around other people,

321
00:14:49,901 --> 00:14:53,390
other people influence your thoughts,
they influence what you feel,

322
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:56,960
the influenced the way you react to
things and to be alone.

323
00:14:56,961 --> 00:14:59,480
And then on top of that to be alone in
nature.

324
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,360
That's what's,
that's really interesting.

325
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:06,140
That's really interesting to me because
that was a tornado out there.

326
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,710
Yeah.
It's like a dusty twister dust bin over

327
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,210
the call.
Went to that cross.

328
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,860
God Damn Tornado,
I better run for the hills.

329
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,200
I think that's what hit us like,
you know,

330
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:20,020
before we came into Austin and we've got
swiped,

331
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:24,500
but I think it was one of those,
we got hit by this huge Austin,

332
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,210
Nevada,
by the way,

333
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,320
not Austin,
Texas.

334
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,390
I thought you locked doors too.
I do.

335
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,250
I like Austin,
Texas.

336
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,780
I Hate Boston,
Nevada.

337
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:35,030
I'm just fucking around phones.
Um,

338
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,010
but the place where we are at,
um,

339
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,090
is particularly unusual kind of nature
cause it's,

340
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,360
it's desert,
but it's uh,

341
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,640
it's got these sage plants everywhere.

342
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,730
We should really smell awesome when you
step on them and break them.

343
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,380
They have this cool,
you know,

344
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:54,710
say he just got a great smell to it.
So you have this,

345
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,630
the sage plants all over the place in
these very small shrubs,

346
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,390
occasional trees,
not that many,

347
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,320
but mostly like these like six foot high
and most shrubs.

348
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:10,570
And there was a few of those trees like
those cedars and there's a,

349
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,660
and these red Mahogany,
so it's,

350
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:16,880
it's high desert.
So high elevation desert please.

351
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:19,430
Big massive basins,
flat basis with,

352
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,900
uh,
pretty,

353
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,710
uh,
sharp and tall mountains.

354
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,270
Kind of,
I mean,

355
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,070
each of these basins in the valley and
up to what,

356
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,710
what was it,
12,500 or 13,000 feet?

357
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,840
Yeah,
just above where we were hunting.

358
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,740
We were really high up there.
We were above 9,000 feet and there's a

359
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:42,250
rock slides everywhere where like the,
the side of the mountains are eroding

360
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,500
and we had to climb up that shit.
It's all these like chunks of rock and

361
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,200
especially problematic when you're
trying to sneak up on these fucking

362
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,000
awesome hearing mule deer.
Cause everything's like clank client.

363
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:58,160
It's like,
like you're stepping on broken pottery

364
00:16:58,161 --> 00:17:00,170
everywhere.
It's just weird.

365
00:17:00,171 --> 00:17:02,390
It almost looks like somebody made it,
you know,

366
00:17:02,391 --> 00:17:04,940
when you see all the,
it's like somebody decided to make like

367
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:08,690
a giant runway filled with broken chips
of rock.

368
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,260
Just really,
really cool.

369
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,470
But just like an alien landscape.
I've never been to uh,

370
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,120
the,
the,

371
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,340
the high country,
the desert up there before.

372
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,700
So for me it was a,
it was a first and it was also,

373
00:17:22,701 --> 00:17:25,820
um,
it's,

374
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,250
it's beautiful,
but it's,

375
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,680
you don't want to live there,
but it's,

376
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,150
it's cool to visit.
You know,

377
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,280
it's like one of those things I don't
want to,

378
00:17:34,281 --> 00:17:36,770
I'll dry it is,
that's my only beef with it.

379
00:17:36,771 --> 00:17:38,450
I think it is beautiful,
but it's,

380
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:44,300
it just looks like it needs a bath.
But it's interesting too because it's so

381
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:48,530
perfect for these deer,
the deer everywhere up there and they're

382
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:53,250
fucking big and fat and healthy and all
they're doing is eating these sage

383
00:17:53,251 --> 00:17:57,630
bushes and then taking naps and running
from mountain lions and shit.

384
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:02,640
Cause we found some big thick ropes of
shit there were filled with hair that is

385
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:07,641
either a giant fucking coyote or most
likely a mountain lion or maybe bear.

386
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,910
That one seemed way too big to be
coyote's.

387
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,820
That's a,
that's a,

388
00:18:11,821 --> 00:18:13,140
that was a mount lunch,
right?

389
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,033
Probably.
Yeah.

390
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,980
Woke up one more.
Buy a pack of coyotes around us.

391
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,010
Yeah.
How they were fucking scream and they

392
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:23,880
sounded so awesome.
There was screaming.

393
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,010
It's interesting.
We only saw a deer and uh,

394
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,890
we saw a couple of coyotes or scanning
the horizon.

395
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:36,360
But the landscape for people is death.
If you lived out there,

396
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:38,430
you'd be fucked.
First of all,

397
00:18:38,431 --> 00:18:41,460
you never catch one of these deer.
If he had a rifle,

398
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,200
you have a really good chance because
for some reason they know your bow

399
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:51,201
hunting so they stay and like one 61 70
yards and just fucking stare at you.

400
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,020
But anything you get inside of that
they're like,

401
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:57,460
fuck this.
I'll be dear.

402
00:18:57,461 --> 00:19:01,290
Did you,
did we get within a hundred yards of

403
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,510
like maybe two groups,
two groups?

404
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:08,540
The first day we got inside of 30 and I
could have had a shot if it wasn't for

405
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:12,030
it.
We only had a tag for a buck.

406
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:15,060
I should probably explain what a tag is.
We're hung on public land.

407
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,420
Do you may not know this because uh,
most people don't,

408
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:21,870
and I didn't until I started hunting,
but we,

409
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:26,871
the people of the United States of
America own massive chunks of land is

410
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:31,260
your land is my land.
It's like that song,

411
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,000
this land is,
you know that.

412
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,240
But it really is that it's not just in
theory,

413
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,600
it's public land and it's rare because
most countries don't have what we have.

414
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:47,300
We have these giant chunks of forest
that you can hunt in and you could fish

415
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:50,520
in and you can hike in and you can camp
in.

416
00:19:50,521 --> 00:19:53,670
You can do all these different things,
but to hunting them.

417
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,040
Um,
one thing that people don't know,

418
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,930
especially people that are like down on
hunting,

419
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:02,370
is it hunting is closely regulated by
wildlife agencies.

420
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:07,370
That's manned by biologists that are
working on science and data for that

421
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:11,340
particular area.
So in the area where we were at,

422
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,310
it's not that easy to get a tag.
So Steve Rinella,

423
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:17,580
how to use his points to get me in there
as well.

424
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:22,980
And what points are as you put in for a
tag you have to put in every year and it

425
00:20:22,981 --> 00:20:26,130
takes like a few years.
So if you can hunt in this place,

426
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,310
you could probably only hunt here like
every three years.

427
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,280
But there's other places like the Nevada
Strip,

428
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,170
which is on the Utah,
Nevada border.

429
00:20:34,171 --> 00:20:37,260
That is so awesome.
There's some strip that's in Nevada,

430
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,760
I'm sorry,
Arizona Strip,

431
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:40,530
which is on the border of Arizona and
Utah,

432
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,230
which is the most cherished place for
mule deer.

433
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:47,590
Where you can only hunt.
They're like once in your life.

434
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,480
Like literally it takes like 20 plus
years to get a tag like area.

435
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,150
I think it's a 13 v.
Yeah.

436
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,290
So it's supposed to be the shit.
So these places,

437
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,200
um,
it's not,

438
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,780
there's not a lot of people there.
Like we were like,

439
00:21:04,781 --> 00:21:07,540
we saw a few people while we were there
that were also hunting.

440
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:10,000
Uh,
shout out to James Kawasaki.

441
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,560
It gave us some,
uh,

442
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,400
some great tips.
We met a really cool dude from Hawaii,

443
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,730
James Kawasaki.
We found him a hunting up there and he

444
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:21,720
gave us some good tips about where to go
and study.

445
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,480
Know he's such a fucking good dude.
It's cool when you meet someone like

446
00:21:25,481 --> 00:21:27,250
that is doing the same thing that you're
doing.

447
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:29,200
And then he was leaving and we were
comments,

448
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,700
be able for generous.
Yeah.

449
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:33,880
It wasn't a guy who was like,
I'm not going to give you information,

450
00:21:33,881 --> 00:21:35,230
which happens.
Yes.

451
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,060
Yeah.
You get people that want to hoard,

452
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,590
hoard their honey holes.

453
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:42,100
But he gave us all this information so
it still doesn't help.

454
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,720
That's probably why he gave us the
information.

455
00:21:43,721 --> 00:21:44,554
She's like,
but shit,

456
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,930
he ain't get county thing.
So for us,

457
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,270
trip Nevada folk have been incredibly
generous.

458
00:21:49,271 --> 00:21:53,290
He was doing this and we're uh,
we're right behind a truck pulling a

459
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,630
trailer,
but that belongs to remy Warren and his

460
00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:57,580
family.
And they just hooked us up.

461
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,340
The stuff in the trailer,
two trucks,

462
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,970
it was really incredibly generous.
Maybe that's the thing about Nevada,

463
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,640
maybe it's a big empty placement.
Maybe everybody's really,

464
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,480
I joke around about,
you know,

465
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,810
that place being a drug addled Shill,
but I,

466
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,510
I've met a lot of really nice people
from Nevada.

467
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,900
I mean it's,
it has a bad reputation because vegas is

468
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:21,901
linked to organized crime and gambling
and all the other sorted shit that comes

469
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:25,270
with that.
People think of it as like,

470
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,060
you know,
it was horrible sin full place,

471
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,850
but that's just a small area of Nevada.

472
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:35,370
Most of my friends that I know that live
around Vegas that are involved in like

473
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,200
the MMA business there,
they're fucking the nicest people in the

474
00:22:38,201 --> 00:22:41,080
world.
And they'll tell you like in Nevada is

475
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,740
like what's outside of the Strip.
It's a great town.

476
00:22:44,741 --> 00:22:47,320
Like Henderson Henderson's a great town.
Yeah.

477
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,570
It's really nice place to live.
It's real safe.

478
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,090
So there's a lot of good spots in
Nevada.

479
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,260
But uh,
anyway,

480
00:22:53,261 --> 00:22:56,150
point being we're out here,
um,

481
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:56,870
in,
uh,

482
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:59,440
you know,
it just a really fascinating,

483
00:22:59,441 --> 00:23:04,441
interesting landscape to spend seven
days but bring a lot of fucking water,

484
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:10,000
that's for sure.
I'm impressed that you haven't been in a

485
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:12,040
landscape like this before.
To me,

486
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:15,760
this is what the majority of the
American West looks like.

487
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,100
It's Brown.
Yeah.

488
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,130
Flat with know bumpy mountains,
all of them.

489
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,330
Well,
um,

490
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:27,370
the first place that we hunted in
Montana was a little like this when

491
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:28,170
we're,
uh,

492
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:31,780
in the Missouri breaks,
which is a right on the banks of the

493
00:23:31,781 --> 00:23:32,650
Missouri River.

494
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,720
And that's,
that's how I got hooked.

495
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:39,820
It's Goddamn Steve Rinella.
He was a little crack dealer with this

496
00:23:39,821 --> 00:23:42,880
hunting stuff.
He gave me the first dose for free

497
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,730
and then he got me.
But it's the same sort of feeling in the

498
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:53,731
Missouri breaks is that feeling of
massiveness and also that you are

499
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:58,940
completely insignificant.
Invisible.

500
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,790
Yeah.
The universe or the world,

501
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,280
the natural world around you.
It really doesn't give a fuck.

502
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:07,940
You could fall and smash your head open
on a rock and those wheel dear will

503
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,040
bounce on by you.
Like nothing happened.

504
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,300
You know,
it's uh,

505
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,253
it's just,
it's,

506
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,690
it's amazing.
It's amazing like that.

507
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,830
I think the place it's sunk that in the
most was probably Prince of Wales,

508
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:24,370
so uninviting
Laska one of the harshest places I've

509
00:24:25,101 --> 00:24:25,821
been,
I don't know.

510
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:27,630
It's weird though because that,
that one's like heaven.

511
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,270
Hell.
Like the sun comes out,

512
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,070
it's,
you don't want to be anywhere else.

513
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,740
But then most of the year when it is
raining,

514
00:24:33,741 --> 00:24:35,970
because it does need most of the year,
it's,

515
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,580
it's just,
it's fucking miserable.

516
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:42,290
It rained every fucking day.
We were there all day and Dan Dodi was

517
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:43,910
warning us before we went,
Damn.

518
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,260
I was like,
fuck that place.

519
00:24:45,261 --> 00:24:47,990
I don't want to go back to that place.
And Steve and I was like,

520
00:24:47,991 --> 00:24:49,740
why you say that?
I love that place,

521
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,953
please.
Awesome.

522
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,630
So I swore twice in my life I would not
go back and I broke that prompt us.

523
00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:00,640
But it is also just amazing.
Just so as far as the,

524
00:25:00,641 --> 00:25:04,070
the,
the animals both under the water and

525
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:06,620
above the water.
It's just a rich rich environment.

526
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,040
Well then it's,
it's also super unusual too.

527
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,620
Like the way it looks.
It's a rain forest.

528
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,060
It is.
Well it's close.

529
00:25:14,061 --> 00:25:17,270
I don't think it's quite maybe parts of
the island art,

530
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,890
I'd have to look that up,
but he's like,

531
00:25:19,891 --> 00:25:20,810
he's a shit ton now.

532
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,570
Both what it,
when it was really cool about it,

533
00:25:23,571 --> 00:25:27,830
there's a lake at the top that's so high
up that beavers don't go there,

534
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,190
so you can drink right out of the lake.
So we would take our water bottles,

535
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,950
we just dip it in the lake.
It just drink right out of the way.

536
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,330
So this place is almost the exact
opposite of that.

537
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:44,170
Whereas that place is all just rain and,
and lush greenery and the occasional

538
00:25:46,821 --> 00:25:49,340
sunshine pops through and you're like,
wow,

539
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:53,020
look at this place.
It's shines like a green emerald.

540
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,200
Yeah,
there you go.

541
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,660
To,
would you rather get dropped off making

542
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:01,250
keep here and there have to make it
there.

543
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,740
There.
You'd probably make it better.

544
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:08,060
You wouldn't make it here naked.
Your skin would peel off.

545
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,713
You know,
there you could,

546
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,530
you would be cold as fuck until he
figured out how to start a fire,

547
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,420
how to kill something and where it's
skin.

548
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,540
Yeah.
You'd have to set it up to be a large

549
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:18,374
thing,
right?

550
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,230
You have to kill a bunch of squirrels to
sew them together,

551
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,930
make a Dick Holster,
because

552
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,560
a lot of shit you can,
but then again,

553
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:29,660
if you just take it,
that means you don't even have a gun or

554
00:26:29,661 --> 00:26:32,600
a bow and Arrow and that's not good.
Then those things are good,

555
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,970
but I think that Prince of Wales was
like the most profound of all the that

556
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,410
experience.
Like I felt it.

557
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:44,470
The Missouri breaks that,
that feeling of like complete Ditto,

558
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,590
not detachment,
but like it doesn't give a fuck.

559
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,350
Then the landscape does not give a fuck
it.

560
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:57,370
It's just completely oblivious to your
presence and it has existed in this form

561
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,210
for thousands and thousands and
thousands of years.

562
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,070
Did you get that feeling here too?
Yeah.

563
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,091
Yeah.
Yeah,

564
00:27:03,091 --> 00:27:03,690
definitely.

565
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,970
I was curious because both of those
aunts,

566
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,430
both of Missouri breaks the Alaska one
word.

567
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,710
We're,
we're a non motorized,

568
00:27:10,711 --> 00:27:12,150
you know,
so like is there any breaks?

569
00:27:12,151 --> 00:27:15,150
We dropped the cars off and we voted and
truly,

570
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,690
you know you call that a true wilderness
experience and same thing with Prince of

571
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:21,210
Wales and we got dropped off by a plane,
Andy,

572
00:27:21,211 --> 00:27:23,610
if we needed to get out there and in a
pitch,

573
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,740
you know,
we get out of there and a picture it

574
00:27:25,741 --> 00:27:27,870
would have been.
So I was wondering if that was a little

575
00:27:27,871 --> 00:27:29,630
bit of the of the feeling you got.
But yeah,

576
00:27:29,631 --> 00:27:33,540
there's a little bit more of an ominous
sitting set of situations.

577
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,420
Yeah.
Here we had a truck that we would drive

578
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:40,830
to the top of this hill and then for the
top of the hill we walked and fuck did

579
00:27:40,831 --> 00:27:45,831
we walk Dan Dodi and I walked up hills
at Dai thousand foot elevation,

580
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:51,000
some steep fucking kills two hours and
hours every day.

581
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:52,710
Dude,
I was hurting.

582
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,330
But it was a great cardio though.
Awesome workout.

583
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,480
So you were telling me about these
wilderness trips that you take people

584
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:04,314
on,

585
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,510
you like wilderness therapy.
So my,

586
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,640
my first job out of college,
um,

587
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,020
I had been living in Panama with my ex
girlfriend and we were moving to Utah

588
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:16,720
and I just needed a job and I didn't
know what I was going to do.

589
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,350
And
so I'm going to Craig's list and we

590
00:28:20,351 --> 00:28:22,510
looked at salt,
the area around Salt Lake City and there

591
00:28:22,511 --> 00:28:27,511
was a job advertisement for a wilderness
guide or wilderness instructor.

592
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,550
They called it,
I didn't know this shit existed at that

593
00:28:30,551 --> 00:28:31,061
point.
So yeah,

594
00:28:31,061 --> 00:28:34,180
there's,
there's a huge industry and most of it's

595
00:28:34,181 --> 00:28:37,720
in the western United States,
but their therapeutic wilderness

596
00:28:37,721 --> 00:28:40,990
programs,
which are tied to a bunch of therapeutic

597
00:28:40,991 --> 00:28:43,720
boarding schools.
So in the most basic sense,

598
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:48,580
there's kids from generally pretty
wealthy families across the country that

599
00:28:48,581 --> 00:28:51,400
are having trouble.
Their parents don't know what to do and

600
00:28:51,401 --> 00:28:53,740
they'll send them away,
you know,

601
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,910
as an intervention.

602
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:59,860
And usually the intention just to have
these kids go to a boarding school where

603
00:28:59,861 --> 00:29:03,910
there's a therapeutic presence also.
But in order to get into those schools,

604
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:06,940
those schools require a wilderness
stage.

605
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:07,810
So,
um,

606
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:11,710
so I worked for a program and went out
there and,

607
00:29:11,711 --> 00:29:13,150
and just kind of,
it was,

608
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:13,541
uh,
it was,

609
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:14,374
uh,
uh,

610
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,970
the type of program where everything was
made by hands.

611
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,350
He got out there,
you will given a half of an elk hide,

612
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,320
you were given a knife,
and then you were taught some of the

613
00:29:23,321 --> 00:29:25,750
basic skills.
So we had to make our own backpacks out

614
00:29:25,751 --> 00:29:28,990
of sticks and elk hide.
We would sew our own moccasins,

615
00:29:28,991 --> 00:29:31,810
we would do all that kind of stuff.
And then all the fire that we made,

616
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,950
we had to make my hand,
you know,

617
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,590
with a boat drill too.
Whoa.

618
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:36,550
So,
yeah,

619
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,260
so it was,
it was this amazing,

620
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,050
it was really life changing for me
because I you,

621
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,460
I love the outdoors.

622
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,130
I love the wilderness and all that kind
of stuff.

623
00:29:44,131 --> 00:29:45,730
And then I didn't know what I wanted to
do with my life,

624
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:50,790
but got out to this place where there's
literally walked out into the,

625
00:29:50,891 --> 00:29:53,440
actually,
it looks a lot like this where I work.

626
00:29:53,441 --> 00:29:58,320
So just these massive brown dry
wilderness areas and got out there in

627
00:29:58,321 --> 00:30:00,210
these groups of kids.
Um,

628
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:04,600
some of these kids would stay in these
programs for 90 to 120 days.

629
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:08,500
And so literally,
and here's the part that I still very

630
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:11,800
much don't agree with and I don't like,
is that these programs would literally

631
00:30:11,801 --> 00:30:15,150
kidnap you out of your bed.
There's companies of yelling,

632
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,053
but yeah,
man.

633
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,320
Yeah.
So there's like,

634
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,170
you can do that for a job.
You can be kind of a heavier,

635
00:30:20,171 --> 00:30:23,110
a tough guy that literally goes for an
intervention,

636
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:28,140
flies to a family's whole,
takes the kid out of their bed and flies

637
00:30:28,421 --> 00:30:30,340
them and drop them in the middle of the
wilderness.

638
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,203
And it's,
it's,

639
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,090
as you can imagine,
it's traumatic man.

640
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:35,790
It's,
it's not like you're,

641
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,750
how old are these kids?
Usually?

642
00:30:37,751 --> 00:30:40,720
14 to 19 is low.
19.

643
00:30:40,721 --> 00:30:42,400
That's an adult.
Yeah.

644
00:30:42,401 --> 00:30:43,990
Well that's where it gets sketchy as
far.

645
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:48,280
So that's sketchy.
Maybe I should say 14 to 18 and the

646
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:49,670
adult too.
Yeah.

647
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:53,540
So they have ways to sort of override
the age system at,

648
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,270
at times.
Um,

649
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:00,760
yeah.
So these programs are meant to sort of

650
00:31:00,761 --> 00:31:05,170
give the kid a chance to look at their
lives,

651
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,620
how they've been behaving,
and an opportunity to just kind of like

652
00:31:08,621 --> 00:31:10,810
we were talking about,
but reflect and sort of explore and

653
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:12,010
learn.
And there's,

654
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,920
there is actually,
there's a lot of good,

655
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,140
there's a lot of good that happened.
It's like it really does help people.

656
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,020
Um,
and there,

657
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,660
in my opinion,
there's a lot of bad too.

658
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,370
I don't think you can ever imagine that
you could literally kidnapped the kid

659
00:31:24,371 --> 00:31:27,770
out of your house and not fuck up the
trust you have with.

660
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,613
Yeah.
It's,

661
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:31,450
it's messed up.
Um,

662
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,090
yeah,
but that's,

663
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,690
so I did that for,
I started there and then I started

664
00:31:34,691 --> 00:31:39,370
working in a more state run sort of
correctional programs.

665
00:31:39,371 --> 00:31:43,510
So for a long time,
and I lead the trips in Minnesota that

666
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:44,344
were,
um,

667
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:49,500
it was a 21 day sentence,
but it was basically an alternative to a

668
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:52,900
60 day Juvi sentence.
So basically you steal a car,

669
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,900
you could either go,
the judge can either send you to Juvie

670
00:31:55,901 --> 00:32:00,610
for 60 days or send them to me and then
we'd go on a a bad ass,

671
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,870
like,
you know,

672
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:05,200
200 mile hiking trip or something.
Definitely take that over at Juvi.

673
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,510
Oh yeah.
Well,

674
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:10,120
but yet big for obvious reasons.
But then the other reasons too is that,

675
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,133
um,
you know,

676
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:16,140
these programs are generally run by
really like grounded good people that

677
00:32:17,591 --> 00:32:19,750
treat people well,
at least the ones I always worked for.

678
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:24,810
I worked for programs with really like
exemplary leadership and you know,

679
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:30,070
I think what these kids could learn and
those programs as opposed to go into

680
00:32:30,071 --> 00:32:32,340
Juvie,
you know,

681
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,150
being in the shit holes that doors are,
it was a,

682
00:32:34,151 --> 00:32:36,120
it was a really bad,
much better option,

683
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,360
you know?
Yeah.

684
00:32:37,361 --> 00:32:39,070
I would imagine that's a way,
way better.

685
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:44,100
But just to kidnapping part is crazy
because the states,

686
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:49,430
they've given up on discipline their
kids so much that they just say,

687
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:50,130
all right,
I can't,

688
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,830
I've,
I fucked up raising this kid.

689
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:56,840
It's time to just electro shock therapy.
Jolt them with wilderness.

690
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,130
Totally,
totally.

691
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,320
And it's a long,
slow,

692
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:04,140
uncomfortable shock,
like 120 days in the desert like this

693
00:33:04,141 --> 00:33:06,290
and this.
Oh my God.

694
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,860
So when you get these kids,
so like if they're kidnapped,

695
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,100
how many days into this kidnapping do
you meet them?

696
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,660
Well,
day one.

697
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,250
I mean the data right away.
Yeah.

698
00:33:16,251 --> 00:33:18,120
So a lot of programs have kind of like
a,

699
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,140
an inbetween camps.
So you come in and maybe the first two

700
00:33:21,141 --> 00:33:22,520
weeks,
like a halfway house.

701
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:23,391
Yeah,
yeah.

702
00:33:23,391 --> 00:33:27,020
Like a wilderness halfway house,
like a base camp,

703
00:33:27,021 --> 00:33:29,300
you know,
like where you learn how to do some of

704
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:33,410
the skills and maybe you start.
So the other thing is is there's

705
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:37,580
relationships with and therapists have
these programs and that's how it works,

706
00:33:37,581 --> 00:33:39,410
you know?
So there's the people that work with the

707
00:33:39,411 --> 00:33:42,770
kids directly are like what I did,
which as an instructor,

708
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:47,590
so it usually there'd be two of us,
two adults with a group of 10 kids and

709
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,700
it was all an all boy usually segregated
into,

710
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,720
into male and female.
So I pretty much just work with dudes

711
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,520
for a long,
long,

712
00:33:55,521 --> 00:33:56,181
long,
long time.

713
00:33:56,181 --> 00:34:00,980
So it's the instructors with lead the
days and you'd usually hike or float or

714
00:34:00,981 --> 00:34:04,730
whatever you do and you know most of the
day and then you would run,

715
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,380
you call them.

716
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:11,030
Circles are like processing things where
everybody would use will really,

717
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:14,390
a lot of it was came down to learning
how to communicate and communicating

718
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:17,910
honestly and openly as really good.
Actually I learned a lot by,

719
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:20,930
by being there doing it.
But then once a week or twice a week,

720
00:34:20,931 --> 00:34:25,931
a therapist would drop in somehow
magically and have therapy sessions with

721
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:27,770
everybody.
Huh.

722
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,480
So a therapist,
they didn't even know,

723
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,360
well they developed a relationship with
them,

724
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,860
you know,
and they'd worked with him for,

725
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,630
you know,
three to four months that they were

726
00:34:35,631 --> 00:34:39,580
there.
So they became a pretty fluffy,

727
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,910
you know,
usually they became pretty close with

728
00:34:41,911 --> 00:34:45,050
the therapist too.
So did that,

729
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:48,200
did it stick with many of these kids
have so many questions,

730
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,190
did it stick with them?
Like wait,

731
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,550
how many of them,
like that experience actually changed

732
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:53,990
their life so that,
yeah.

733
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,370
Good,
good question.

734
00:34:55,371 --> 00:34:58,130
And I don't think anybody has the actual
hard numbers on that.

735
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,550
Maybe some people are looking to get
that and they call that recidivism.

736
00:35:01,551 --> 00:35:04,210
Right?
Like if he ended up back in the morning

737
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:09,370
are um,
I know for a fact that I stay in contact

738
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:13,310
with a ton of the kids that I worked
with just cause you know,

739
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:17,240
we've got to know each other really well
and respect each other and became

740
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:21,710
friends.
And I know I've seen the benefit

741
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,000
almost across the board.
Like,

742
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:28,460
like good things learned,
a lot of growing up happened,

743
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,250
you know,
it's kind of like a forced right rite of

744
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:32,330
passage in a sense.
You know,

745
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:33,460
the idea that forced,
right?

746
00:35:33,461 --> 00:35:34,001
Yeah,
of course.

747
00:35:34,001 --> 00:35:38,360
Read of passage,
which I don't agree with the forest a

748
00:35:38,361 --> 00:35:40,140
lot of,
I know a bunch of those kids I could

749
00:35:40,141 --> 00:35:45,141
point to 12 right now that I know just
kind of turned around and maybe went to

750
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:50,100
college or didn't go to college but
ended up having good relationships with

751
00:35:50,101 --> 00:35:53,040
their family,
are feeling good about life.

752
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:56,010
But then there's probably far,
far,

753
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:59,460
I know there's far more where that
didn't necessarily happen.

754
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,580
I don't necessarily think it was a bad
deal for them to go through that

755
00:36:02,581 --> 00:36:03,840
experience.
Um,

756
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:05,930
but it's,
it's not,

757
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,160
it's not a cure all,
but what it does,

758
00:36:08,161 --> 00:36:12,390
I think it's self selects for,
for people who really do kind of want to

759
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,410
figure shit out cause it gives you a
break and time to do that.

760
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:19,951
But yeah,
no,

761
00:36:19,951 --> 00:36:21,240
I wish I had,
I wish I had more time.

762
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,270
How much resistance did you experience?
Like when these kids were getting

763
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,270
kidnapped and all of a sudden they would
come to you?

764
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:29,610
Like how many of them were like,
fuck this,

765
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,860
get me home please?
My mom.

766
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:32,970
Many.
I mean,

767
00:36:32,971 --> 00:36:33,691
yeah,
I don't know.

768
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:38,280
30 40 50% of just like either shutting
down completely and not compliant with

769
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:39,300
anything.
I'm more,

770
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,710
you know,
direct,

771
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:44,310
direct sort of resistance or amy or
things like that.

772
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,880
Most of those come around.
What's up?

773
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,050
Did they come around?
Oh,

774
00:36:49,051 --> 00:36:50,010
totally.
Yeah.

775
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,770
There's not,
there's only a couple folks,

776
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,260
a couple of dudes I ever knew that kept
it up,

777
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,820
you know,
that kind of had the,

778
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:59,340
had the stamina to keep that up at some
point.

779
00:36:59,341 --> 00:37:00,121
It was,
you know,

780
00:37:00,121 --> 00:37:03,510
it's just sort of like accepting the
fact that you were there,

781
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,250
you know,
I mean cause fuck man,

782
00:37:05,251 --> 00:37:08,820
they get get literally dropped in the
middle of a desert and you're told

783
00:37:08,821 --> 00:37:12,690
you're going to be there for three
months or four months at some point.

784
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,960
You either have to accept it.
Well not either.

785
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:20,300
I think.
I think you just do just kind of,

786
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:23,970
you know face reality.
Well for someone who's on a fucked up

787
00:37:23,971 --> 00:37:27,600
path,
it really might be one of the only ways

788
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:31,920
to correct it,
to give yourself that chance.

789
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,670
Like we were talking about being out
there in the desert,

790
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,870
the high country and you get kind of
like a little bit of a reset.

791
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,550
Like you get to relax and be alone with
your thoughts and just experience a

792
00:37:44,551 --> 00:37:49,551
completely different set of,
of the input of a set of data than

793
00:37:51,091 --> 00:37:54,000
you're used to.
We're used to like certain kinds of data

794
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:56,760
and the input.
And for a lot of these kids they used to

795
00:37:56,761 --> 00:38:01,320
hanging around with fuck ups and being
around their asshole friends and doing

796
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:05,160
stupid shit together.
And they get stuck in these patterns.

797
00:38:05,161 --> 00:38:10,161
These grooves get cut deep and the
momentum of their life and their past is

798
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:15,510
incredibly difficult to escape.
So that's why I was really excited to

799
00:38:15,511 --> 00:38:17,130
hear about this when you were telling me
about it.

800
00:38:17,131 --> 00:38:18,010
I was like,
oh that,

801
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:21,210
that might work like for some people.
Right.

802
00:38:21,211 --> 00:38:21,960
Well,
so,

803
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,690
and then you asked,
so how many does it work for?

804
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,720
One of the tougher things is that even
if it does work,

805
00:38:30,151 --> 00:38:33,710
so say you yanked out of your home and
uh,

806
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:35,830
like just said,
so your,

807
00:38:35,831 --> 00:38:36,010
your

808
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:40,350
home and your friends and your community
has so much to do with,

809
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:42,220
with how you end up interacting in what
you do.

810
00:38:42,221 --> 00:38:46,990
So even if you get sent away for four
months or even years to these programs

811
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:50,890
and then you may change,
we pro club,

812
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,800
not even me,
you will change your a kickboard someone

813
00:38:53,801 --> 00:38:56,830
will change,
but then no matter how much you change

814
00:38:56,831 --> 00:38:58,990
it,
you go back to that situation that you

815
00:38:58,991 --> 00:39:01,660
came from the house,
your family,

816
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:04,000
just the culture that you're in.
God,

817
00:39:04,001 --> 00:39:05,520
is it hard to,
uh,

818
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,620
to,
to walk,

819
00:39:07,621 --> 00:39:10,890
to not slip back into old patterns,
but then also even just to fit in that

820
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:11,590
site.
So that's,

821
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:14,230
that's what I've been working with kids
the Way Leon is that,

822
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,660
you know,
go away and have these big experiences

823
00:39:16,661 --> 00:39:18,280
that they,
then they go home and mom and dad are

824
00:39:18,281 --> 00:39:22,720
still exactly how they were.
And you know,

825
00:39:22,721 --> 00:39:26,770
as a try to be impartial.
I don't think I'm good at being

826
00:39:26,771 --> 00:39:29,590
impartial,
but I try looking in getting to know

827
00:39:29,591 --> 00:39:31,660
these kids and all the things that they
went through.

828
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:37,830
It's so fucking hard not to point.
Every finger had the family and the pen.

829
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:40,630
And you know,
what's hard is that the parents were

830
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:44,860
raised by equally fucked up.
So it's almost not even their fault.

831
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,000
No.
The,

832
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,580
the line of blame,
if you want to do that,

833
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:50,740
can go back and really long.
So the monkeys from the trees,

834
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:52,060
if you believe in that.
Yeah.

835
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:55,960
So that's the thing about a wilderness,
like a long intervention like that at

836
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,510
that,
I think that's what I meant about self

837
00:39:57,511 --> 00:40:02,130
select because it's possible for
somebody who really wants to change

838
00:40:02,131 --> 00:40:02,701
stuff,
you know,

839
00:40:02,701 --> 00:40:05,190
to change,
to change the momentum of your family,

840
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:09,060
to change the momentum of your past.
It takes a lot of energy to do it.

841
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,260
It takes like a lot of dedication,
a lot of letting go of a bunch of stuff.

842
00:40:13,261 --> 00:40:15,940
But it really is a pretty amazing thing
to,

843
00:40:15,941 --> 00:40:19,260
to be a part of.
And that kind of experience does

844
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,140
facilitate that sort of thing if one

845
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,730
wants to.
But then like I said,

846
00:40:23,731 --> 00:40:25,150
once you get home,
it doesn't give you,

847
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:27,330
it's not like it gets easier.
But yeah,

848
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,450
you certainly can grow a lot and you can
change a lot.

849
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,850
It's almost like we need that for
parents too.

850
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,100
Yeah,
man.

851
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,160
Yeah,
totally.

852
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,930
I agree.
I mean,

853
00:40:36,931 --> 00:40:41,931
parenting is a very bizarre,
it's sort of a,

854
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:48,900
it's incredibly complicated,
very difficult to do.

855
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,760
And it's an unbelievably,
she neutra responsibility to be in

856
00:40:53,761 --> 00:40:58,761
charge of the,
the really the future of a life and all

857
00:41:00,121 --> 00:41:04,860
the people that life is going to touch.
So if you're using your son is you want

858
00:41:04,861 --> 00:41:09,120
to grow up and all the things that you
teach him and all the experiences that

859
00:41:09,121 --> 00:41:12,870
he has with you will reflect on how he
interacts with other people.

860
00:41:12,871 --> 00:41:17,871
And that ripple effect carries on to
thousands and millions of people

861
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:18,930
potentially.
It's,

862
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:22,920
it's incredibly,
it's so much responsibility and it's

863
00:41:22,921 --> 00:41:26,040
incredibly difficult to do correctly.
And there's no fucking,

864
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:28,620
there's no requirements.
Anybody could do it.

865
00:41:28,621 --> 00:41:30,360
I mean,
it's like one of the most important

866
00:41:30,361 --> 00:41:34,370
things in the world is to raise a person
that's to affect other people in a

867
00:41:34,371 --> 00:41:36,150
positive way and

868
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:41,380
so fucking hard to do.
So hard to do and yet so easy to be in

869
00:41:44,121 --> 00:41:46,740
that position.
All you have to do is fuck it.

870
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:47,990
Everybody fucks.
No,

871
00:41:47,991 --> 00:41:49,680
I can't stop thinking about it.
My,

872
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,820
you know,
my boy was born two months ago.

873
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:56,360
My first kid and um,
I feel all of a sudden saddled with this

874
00:41:56,361 --> 00:41:58,400
responsibility,
not,

875
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,280
it actually just go,
it's going bond beyond him.

876
00:42:01,281 --> 00:42:02,440
I feel like.
Yeah.

877
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:07,310
I just think I feel so much less of a
narcissist than I ever have that just

878
00:42:07,311 --> 00:42:11,600
that it's not about me and I need to
clean my shit up.

879
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,480
I need to,
you know,

880
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,550
get my act together.
It should give him a as good as an

881
00:42:16,551 --> 00:42:18,760
example if I possibly can.
You know,

882
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,990
I think that,
and I don't know,

883
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,400
you know,
I'm a very new dad.

884
00:42:22,401 --> 00:42:26,960
I don't know this,
but I think one of the best things we

885
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:30,200
could do as a people,
as a culture is for,

886
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:31,480
yeah,
Pete,

887
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:36,480
for parents who are put in that position
with all that responsibility to somehow

888
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:41,690
look at themselves real hard and take
that time to,

889
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,390
I don't know the best way to put it,
but just improve themselves rather than

890
00:42:47,391 --> 00:42:50,450
trying to figure out how to parent a
certain way or parent better.

891
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:53,210
I really think the best thing we could
do is just be better people,

892
00:42:53,211 --> 00:42:55,100
would be better humans ourselves.

893
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:58,400
That's a very good point.
That's very quick point.

894
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:00,170
Lead by example.
You know,

895
00:43:00,171 --> 00:43:04,190
that was uh,
when I used to teach taekwondo,

896
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,450
one of the,
um,

897
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:11,020
the things that they would call you,
the term that the Koreans uses sub ohm

898
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:14,030
Nim and there was one who leads by
example.

899
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:17,990
That was the,
the idea behind it behind being an

900
00:43:17,991 --> 00:43:21,890
instructor and to be a parent that leads
by example.

901
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:22,670
I mean,
how,

902
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:27,140
or sometimes some people learn a lot
from parents being a fuck up.

903
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:29,930
Totally.
I know a lot of people's parents were

904
00:43:29,931 --> 00:43:33,560
fucking losers and they're just go get
them totally.

905
00:43:33,561 --> 00:43:35,390
They just get shit done.
And they,

906
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:40,400
their hustle because their parents were
drug addicts or alcoholics or jailbirds

907
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,830
or whatever the fuck it was.
And they just felt the pain of their

908
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:47,600
family being awful.
Totally.

909
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,530
But that's not a good bet.
Well,

910
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:53,760
I mean that's third from experience or
learning by example too.

911
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:56,700
You know,
he can either accept in love with you

912
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:59,410
what's your parents do or rejected or
you know,

913
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:01,300
something in the middle.
I don't know.

914
00:44:01,301 --> 00:44:03,220
But so the eye,
that's what I learned.

915
00:44:03,221 --> 00:44:07,330
So I worked with,
with young guys between the ages of 14

916
00:44:07,331 --> 00:44:10,210
and that toward the end of when I did
that work,

917
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:15,040
I would do more specialty work.
So I do like one on ones to one time I

918
00:44:15,041 --> 00:44:17,770
did a 55 day wilderness trip with one
kid,

919
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,050
just him and I,
that was tire thing.

920
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:24,880
But what I low was that like 55 days was
one kid.

921
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,970
So he was amazing.
So it was fucking fantastic.

922
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,680
It was amazing.
He loved to work out.

923
00:44:29,681 --> 00:44:30,900
So,
um,

924
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,850
he was,
he was a good kid,

925
00:44:32,851 --> 00:44:36,690
man.
He was like 19 or 20 and just not sure

926
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:38,760
about college,
not sure what to do.

927
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,110
Uh,
did they kidnap him?

928
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,450
He knew he was coming because he was an
adult.

929
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,930
He's legally an adult.
Right.

930
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:47,460
Um,
and the first day he showed up and I

931
00:44:47,461 --> 00:44:49,020
remember he said,
you know what,

932
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:51,900
I'm going to pretend like I'm going to
be here until I die.

933
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:53,790
He had this really interesting
perspective.

934
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,500
He's like,
I,

935
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:56,880
he's like,
I know this is going to be long.

936
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:58,650
It's going to suck.
So I'm just going to sort of,

937
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,470
you know,
just not count days.

938
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:03,390
I'm not going to like count my time or
whatever.

939
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:07,350
But he was awesome.
So he was really into lifting weights

940
00:45:07,351 --> 00:45:09,740
and stuff.
And I was at the time and uh,

941
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:14,700
so we would do pushups one day we did,
I think we height like 14 miles in 1400

942
00:45:14,701 --> 00:45:18,660
pushups or something like that.
Like try to blow shoulders up.

943
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,470
It was so fun.
But when I was going to say is that what

944
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,440
I learned from working with kids so much
is that example thing is there's,

945
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:30,530
there's nothing to compare to that as
far as what people are,

946
00:45:31,951 --> 00:45:34,350
kids are good guys especially will
respond to,

947
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:38,070
is that example like you can,
you can tell them,

948
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,793
I mean,
kids,

949
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,470
they catch bullshit the fucking second
it comes out of your mouth.

950
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:44,700
You know,
if you're saying one thing,

951
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:48,630
but you're not living in being honest.
If you're not being real about yourself,

952
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,640
it doesn't,
it doesn't work.

953
00:45:50,641 --> 00:45:51,480
So,
I mean,

954
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,240
I think that that was a real,
you know,

955
00:45:54,241 --> 00:45:57,600
and I did this for five or six years and
I've spent probably six,

956
00:45:57,601 --> 00:46:02,601
700 days out doing this.
And I came back from the experience just

957
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:08,930
seeing this,
this huge gap in our culture about role

958
00:46:10,171 --> 00:46:13,440
models and mentors and just,
just regular relationships that seem

959
00:46:13,441 --> 00:46:17,430
pretty natural and pretty normal.
Um,

960
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:22,020
that just like I would get into a group
of these kids and you would just,

961
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,730
um,
there'd be something there.

962
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:27,900
They would recognize something in me and
I'd recognize something in them and it

963
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:29,790
just a really cool thing to be a part
of,

964
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:31,200
you know.
Um,

965
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:33,690
what did you guys do for 55 days in the
woods?

966
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:37,260
I leave that,
so we would hike a lot most of the day,

967
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:40,760
right?
We would hike probably eight to 15 week

968
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:42,420
camping,
backpacking,

969
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,840
backpack up on the shores of Lake
Superior.

970
00:46:45,841 --> 00:46:47,820
So there's a,
it's called the superior hiking trail.

971
00:46:47,821 --> 00:46:52,110
It's a 200 plus mile footpath that goes
into the hills and mountains,

972
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,620
like over lake superior.
So yeah,

973
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:55,590
man,
we would hike.

974
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:58,310
We'd swim in the lake.
Um,

975
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:01,680
at that point in time I had this idea
that I was going to ask my girlfriend to

976
00:47:01,681 --> 00:47:02,880
marry her.
So I was looking for,

977
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:05,280
there's a,
gets these little jewels,

978
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:09,240
stones and all the rivers.
So we'd spend a lot of time looking for

979
00:47:09,241 --> 00:47:12,230
stones and I don't know man,
just hey,

980
00:47:12,231 --> 00:47:13,080
you know,
you know,

981
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,650
really and push ups and push ups,
push ups.

982
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:20,130
Wow.
And so a lot of conversations about the

983
00:47:20,131 --> 00:47:21,360
future,
about life,

984
00:47:21,361 --> 00:47:24,060
about yeah.
How to change your path.

985
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,111
Yeah.
Yeah.

986
00:47:25,111 --> 00:47:26,320
Some of that.
Um,

987
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,070
and then a lot of times have a lot of
silence,

988
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:30,103
man.
You know,

989
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:32,700
we weren't going to talk what,
16 hours a day,

990
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:37,000
it just be too much.
But yeah,

991
00:47:37,001 --> 00:47:38,830
he ended up doing great man.
I think,

992
00:47:38,831 --> 00:47:41,440
I think he's off kind of killing it in
life right now.

993
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,010
But that's an extreme,
you know,

994
00:47:45,011 --> 00:47:47,710
that's an extreme example.
So now how is this organized?

995
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,030
So it was,
his parents were like,

996
00:47:49,031 --> 00:47:51,400
hey,
fuck up time to put you in the woods.

997
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,360
Yeah.
Yeah.

998
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:55,110
Wow.
So they had heard about it and they,

999
00:47:55,640 --> 00:48:00,160
they just felt like that would be a
chance for him to break his pattern.

1000
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:01,210
Sure,
exactly.

1001
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,170
It's interesting,
like there's,

1002
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,450
there was a generally,
uh,

1003
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:09,070
like different categories of,
of kids who would come to these places.

1004
00:48:09,071 --> 00:48:12,080
So there you'd have your,
um,

1005
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:16,950
drug abuser sorta out of control kid.
You'd have your internet addicted,

1006
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:20,230
um,
slightly softer guy,

1007
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,700
you know,
that socially awkward.

1008
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,790
Sometimes we hit an emotional health
outbreaks.

1009
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,910
Um,
they kind of broke,

1010
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,820
you know,
into categories tends,

1011
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:30,940
but,
but honestly,

1012
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,000
but the thing is,
is the cool thing about spending that

1013
00:48:34,001 --> 00:48:38,380
much time with people is that,
you know,

1014
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:43,390
like he doesn't take long to see through
those behaviors to really seem like a

1015
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,010
good kid.

1016
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:47,530
And Pretty,
I've worked with hundreds if not

1017
00:48:47,531 --> 00:48:52,531
thousands of kids and maybe one,
one,

1018
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,780
I can only think of one that I don't
think was like somebody that went and

1019
00:48:56,781 --> 00:48:58,600
we'd go have a beer with or hang out
with today.

1020
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,040
You know,
like the good kids,

1021
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,720
they're really good.
They're great human beings.

1022
00:49:01,721 --> 00:49:03,170
I just,
um,

1023
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:06,910
either shitty circumstances are made a
lot of bad decisions or just were

1024
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:08,380
confused or,
I mean whatever,

1025
00:49:08,381 --> 00:49:10,750
you know,
I think I could have ended up there easy

1026
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:13,020
if I would've gotten busted in high
school for budgets,

1027
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:14,520
you know,
drinking and partying I,

1028
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:16,690
well,
especially if you were born into the

1029
00:49:16,691 --> 00:49:20,950
household that they were born into.
And that's one of the big things

1030
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,040
obviously about life is that you can't
pick your parents,

1031
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:26,500
you know,
and you can't pick your neighborhood

1032
00:49:26,501 --> 00:49:27,760
that you grew up in.
You can't,

1033
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:29,410
you know,
you don't have a say until you were an

1034
00:49:29,411 --> 00:49:30,244
adult.

1035
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:31,910
Yeah.
That's,

1036
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:33,810
we were talking about yesterday,
the,

1037
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,600
so after I did the wilderness stuff,
I went and,

1038
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,370
um,
I became a high school teacher in the

1039
00:49:39,371 --> 00:49:41,500
Bronx.
I was part of the New York City teaching

1040
00:49:41,501 --> 00:49:44,770
fellowship programs.
So basically we give you a free master's

1041
00:49:44,771 --> 00:49:48,400
if you teach for a couple of years in
high need areas.

1042
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:52,420
So it was an English teacher and it's
really cool to school in the southeast

1043
00:49:52,421 --> 00:49:54,970
Bronx for a couple of years.
And,

1044
00:49:54,971 --> 00:49:56,560
um,
you know,

1045
00:49:57,010 --> 00:50:02,010
just that was the most challenging and
probably rewarding thing that I've ever

1046
00:50:02,621 --> 00:50:06,630
done and really,
so a lot of the positions,

1047
00:50:06,631 --> 00:50:10,990
so first I worked with mostly wealthy
kids at some of these private pay

1048
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:14,170
wilderness programs event.
I did a lot of stuff for correctional

1049
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,240
stuff.
So that was rural poor,

1050
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:18,510
you know,
that was a lot of um,

1051
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:22,810
you know,
kids from reservations and just sort of,

1052
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:26,320
no offense but white trash type kids.

1053
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,830
And then I moved to the inner city and
worked there.

1054
00:50:28,831 --> 00:50:31,360
And so I got a,
I got a good spectrum on,

1055
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:35,330
on working with different kids.
Really just ended up that I kind of

1056
00:50:35,331 --> 00:50:36,400
liked them all.
You know,

1057
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:40,880
there's fucking people,
human beings while you were saying,

1058
00:50:40,881 --> 00:50:41,930
yeah,
you can't pick where your,

1059
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:46,990
where your front man and you can argue
how big of a difference that makes

1060
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:50,420
giant.
It's almost everything in terms of your

1061
00:50:50,421 --> 00:50:51,530
future,
you know,

1062
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:54,190
and so many people don't realize that as
well.

1063
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,980
It's a lot of times the really fortunate
ones don't realize it because they just

1064
00:50:57,981 --> 00:51:00,800
think that everybody's got it like this
or they just take that,

1065
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,840
well,
my life's hard to,

1066
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:04,940
you know,
my life was,

1067
00:51:04,941 --> 00:51:06,890
uh,
only challenging.

1068
00:51:06,891 --> 00:51:09,890
And then we moved around a lot.
Like my mom,

1069
00:51:09,891 --> 00:51:13,070
my Stepdad were really nice.
People got lucky,

1070
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:15,830
you know,
they weren't fuck ups,

1071
00:51:15,831 --> 00:51:18,080
they weren't assholes.

1072
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,320
They didn't know.
They didn't beat me and torture me is

1073
00:51:21,321 --> 00:51:22,580
here.
Such a horrible,

1074
00:51:22,581 --> 00:51:27,581
horrible stories of what parents do to
their children.

1075
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:31,310
And you know,
you got to wonder what their parents did

1076
00:51:31,311 --> 00:51:36,311
to them that started this whole path.
It's almost like unstopped before some

1077
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:40,490
momentum,
but some of the things you were telling

1078
00:51:40,491 --> 00:51:41,540
me about the,
the,

1079
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:44,630
the poor kids that you worked with,
like yeah.

1080
00:51:44,631 --> 00:51:49,631
And so one of the kids that just this
amazing light field kid,

1081
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:52,250
um,
you know,

1082
00:51:52,251 --> 00:51:54,610
co comes,
how did,

1083
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:55,790
I don't remember how it happened.
I think,

1084
00:51:55,791 --> 00:51:58,250
I think he came into school one morning
and uh,

1085
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,140
you know,
his dad had,

1086
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:03,320
had bashed his skull in with a,
with a baseball bat.

1087
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:05,810
Just just,
I think he got drunk and got angry.

1088
00:52:05,811 --> 00:52:08,120
He just beat the fuck on,
you know,

1089
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:13,520
I remember that morning feeling just so
hopeless and just like,

1090
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:17,030
you know,
nothing I could do to protect this kid.

1091
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,630
Like I could be the best teacher,
I can be the best role model and friend

1092
00:52:20,631 --> 00:52:25,190
of this guy then than I ever could be.
But every night he has to go back into

1093
00:52:25,191 --> 00:52:28,610
this
unimaginable,

1094
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:31,170
horrible place,
you know?

1095
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:33,920
And it's insidious.
There's a lot of weird ways it comes out

1096
00:52:33,921 --> 00:52:37,100
to it and it's another student of mine
of mine,

1097
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:42,150
a hug a girl.
Her mom would basically tell her that

1098
00:52:42,231 --> 00:52:44,960
she was always sick and there's a name
for this.

1099
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:48,170
There's like a condition.
I remember where a parent needs their

1100
00:52:48,171 --> 00:52:51,440
kids to be around so much for their own
wellbeing.

1101
00:52:51,441 --> 00:52:53,510
Somehow they turned them into a
hypochondriac.

1102
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,830
Yeah,
it'd be heard of this.

1103
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:55,701
No.
Yeah,

1104
00:52:55,701 --> 00:52:56,534
there's a name for it.

1105
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,420
I can't remember it right now,
but weird shit man.

1106
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:03,920
Just,
just weird stuff.

1107
00:53:03,921 --> 00:53:04,251
And,
you know,

1108
00:53:04,251 --> 00:53:09,250
I think there's so many people that are
working so hard to do good things for

1109
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:11,870
people in,
in the harder circumstances.

1110
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:13,293
And,
uh,

1111
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:17,540
it's,
it's like an overwhelming force.

1112
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,890
It's so hard.
And I,

1113
00:53:18,891 --> 00:53:21,320
but here's the thing I've seen in like,
uh,

1114
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:25,040
I seen a bunch of those kids that I
taught and so I taught in a school,

1115
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:28,590
I was their only teachers.
It's of like a kindergarten model for

1116
00:53:28,591 --> 00:53:29,390
high school.
Right.

1117
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:32,490
And all the learning was based on
projects they did and they had

1118
00:53:32,491 --> 00:53:35,580
internships.
So they didn't go from math to English

1119
00:53:35,581 --> 00:53:38,820
to science and all that.
We just worked one on one and they

1120
00:53:38,821 --> 00:53:39,330
tried,
you know,

1121
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:42,060
kind of worked out everything at all
times.

1122
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:43,710
And uh,
so,

1123
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:47,430
you know,
they were my students for two entire

1124
00:53:47,431 --> 00:53:48,390
years.
And,

1125
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,330
um,
the amount of time we spent together was

1126
00:53:51,331 --> 00:53:53,340
just really intense.
And Man,

1127
00:53:53,341 --> 00:53:56,160
we got very close.
Um,

1128
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:57,480
I'm losing my train of thought.
But yeah,

1129
00:53:57,481 --> 00:53:59,220
so there's a lot of people trying to do
good things,

1130
00:53:59,221 --> 00:54:04,221
but it is that home life or that
cultural pole trajectory.

1131
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:07,920
Um,
I dunno.

1132
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:11,040
I Dunno what the,
I don't know how to combat it.

1133
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:12,410
Well,
one of those,

1134
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:14,150
Pat,
I'm one of those,

1135
00:54:14,151 --> 00:54:15,830
um,
programs like the one that you were

1136
00:54:15,831 --> 00:54:18,650
involved in.
It might be one of the only ways to do

1137
00:54:18,651 --> 00:54:19,230
it.
Yeah.

1138
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:23,510
Or a program like that.
Something that's going to give them

1139
00:54:23,511 --> 00:54:25,400
individualized attention and let them
know,

1140
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,870
hey,
there might be a light at the end of

1141
00:54:26,871 --> 00:54:28,940
this tunnel and it might be a way out of
this.

1142
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,480
There's nice people out there like Dan
Dodi that are going to help you out.

1143
00:54:32,481 --> 00:54:36,290
And he recognizes that there's people
out there that need help,

1144
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:38,720
but they're filled with that shoe.
And everyday too,

1145
00:54:38,721 --> 00:54:39,800
man,
you know,

1146
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:41,270
they're told that by,
by tea.

1147
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,080
And you know,
it's,

1148
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,750
it is interesting because I'm this,
I was born in North Dakota.

1149
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,930
I'm about as white as you could ever be.
And My,

1150
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,190
my students who act,
so I mean,

1151
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:51,290
just for facts.
So like the school,

1152
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:54,320
um,
I work at the bronx completely

1153
00:54:54,321 --> 00:54:57,020
segregated and it was completely black
and Latino,

1154
00:54:57,450 --> 00:55:02,330
uh,
with Mexican and Dominican and Puerto

1155
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:05,060
Rican and black and not a single white
kid in the entire school.

1156
00:55:05,061 --> 00:55:08,120
Like it's just not that way.
And so there's immediately this odd

1157
00:55:08,121 --> 00:55:13,121
dynamic for me to go and teach in a,
in a location like that,

1158
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,370
that there is a racial dynamic present
no matter,

1159
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,610
no matter what.
Like my kids would tease me about how

1160
00:55:19,611 --> 00:55:21,350
when I was on a time,
you know,

1161
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:22,290
it was great.
I mean we,

1162
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:26,990
we got past any racial barriers or at
least most racial barriers,

1163
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:29,870
you know,
we were able just to see each other as

1164
00:55:29,871 --> 00:55:31,880
human beings and him worked together
that way.

1165
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:35,390
But so there is a lot of,
they get what you just said.

1166
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:38,060
They get a lot of people tell him that
all the time,

1167
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:39,350
but there's a light at the end of the
tunnel.

1168
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:40,520
There's,
there's options,

1169
00:55:40,521 --> 00:55:41,180
you know,
you can,

1170
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:45,050
you can take ahold of his life,
but just his words.

1171
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,570
Two kids.
Yeah,

1172
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,310
just lip service,
you know,

1173
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,730
and they hear that before.
Like you gotta get good grades or You

1174
00:55:51,731 --> 00:55:53,880
got to go to college and get a good job
to hear all these things,

1175
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,460
things that don't seem to resonate.
No,

1176
00:55:56,461 --> 00:55:59,010
because it's disconnected from the
experience of life.

1177
00:55:59,011 --> 00:56:00,630
Right.
So I can go in there and say that,

1178
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:04,080
and I went to college and I had a good
safe childhood and then in a safe place

1179
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:07,230
and I can see that it doesn't fucking
mean anything because they go home and

1180
00:56:07,231 --> 00:56:08,760
it's not safe.
It's just not.

1181
00:56:08,761 --> 00:56:11,010
And I think that's what it comes down to
more than anything.

1182
00:56:11,011 --> 00:56:16,011
It's people are in a state of fight or
flight constantly because it's,

1183
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:17,640
it's really,
it's a safety thing.

1184
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:18,643
It's,
yeah.

1185
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:21,420
Yeah.
I mean it's like

1186
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:24,160
everyone rinella was talking a those
deer

1187
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,750
today.
He was like a,

1188
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:28,360
the deer,
a Jack Rabbit runs in front of the deer

1189
00:56:28,361 --> 00:56:30,970
and the deer leaps up.
Like someone hit it with an electric

1190
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:31,804
shock.
Yeah.

1191
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:36,760
Like they're constantly on there,
constantly on guard.

1192
00:56:36,761 --> 00:56:39,760
They,
and that happens also with children and

1193
00:56:39,761 --> 00:56:40,594
yeah.
You know,

1194
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:45,660
I have talked to him this before.
I had a feral cat and that fucking cat

1195
00:56:46,301 --> 00:56:49,720
was wild to the day he died.
I had him when he was a baby.

1196
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,240
I got the money.
He's a kid and he was only a couple

1197
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,320
months old,
but he was already,

1198
00:56:53,321 --> 00:56:55,570
it was already too late.
He was fucking wild.

1199
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:59,230
He was just in his mind,
everything was out to get them.

1200
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:01,750
Yeah.
I mean,

1201
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:07,030
I can't officially say this cause I
haven't studied it officially,

1202
00:57:07,031 --> 00:57:11,420
but I think that there are no versions,
if you call it ps Pete,

1203
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,320
I'm sorry,
ptsd or just stuck in the state of

1204
00:57:14,321 --> 00:57:15,920
hypervigilance,
whatever news.

1205
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:18,550
It's just coming from a place that's not
safe.

1206
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:22,780
A place that's fucked up and to be
expected to,

1207
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:28,560
to be able to overcome that without any
real time assistance and work.

1208
00:57:28,721 --> 00:57:31,240
He's really unreasonable.
I think it's just,

1209
00:57:31,241 --> 00:57:32,320
it's,
it's really not like,

1210
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:37,390
you can't just decide right to quick
cause it's your body.

1211
00:57:37,391 --> 00:57:38,410
It's semantic.
You know?

1212
00:57:38,411 --> 00:57:40,740
It's like,
it's either you get to pay to you.

1213
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:42,580
I mean,
maybe it's your mind.

1214
00:57:42,581 --> 00:57:43,660
Maybe it's your mind.
Maybe it's both,

1215
00:57:43,661 --> 00:57:45,040
but it's,
it's not like you can just say,

1216
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:45,520
okay,
I'm gonna,

1217
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,730
I don't want to do this anymore.
It's far more,

1218
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:50,960
it's far more complicated.
Yeah.

1219
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,840
It's a,
it's a battleship that's moving a

1220
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,570
hundred miles an hour and you're
expected to turn on a dime.

1221
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:59,440
It's not going to,
it's just a lot of weight momentum

1222
00:57:59,441 --> 00:58:03,430
behind that passed.
I was talking to Michael Irvin once,

1223
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:07,130
I was on a flight with them,
just random and uh,

1224
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,880
it was all the way to Australia,
so it's a long ass time.

1225
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:14,170
And he and I were talking about a work
that he's been doing with,

1226
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,630
uh,
some young kids come from troubled

1227
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:21,780
houses and troubled backgrounds as well.
And he was telling me that when a child

1228
00:58:22,511 --> 00:58:27,511
is in the womb and the mother is
experiencing intense stress from

1229
00:58:28,331 --> 00:58:30,250
violence,
from crime,

1230
00:58:30,251 --> 00:58:32,950
bad neighborhoods that kind of shed a
domestic abuse,

1231
00:58:32,951 --> 00:58:37,330
that kind of thing,
that the child grows up with more of a

1232
00:58:37,331 --> 00:58:41,380
propensity for violence like that,
that violence becomes like almost in

1233
00:58:41,381 --> 00:58:45,490
their DNA as a response to any perceived
threat,

1234
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:49,590
whether it's real or not.
And that the,

1235
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,880
we have to understand that these
children,

1236
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:56,910
like they're being wired for violence,
they're wired to deal with bad

1237
00:58:58,061 --> 00:59:00,010
neighborhoods,
bad situations,

1238
00:59:00,011 --> 00:59:01,330
crime,
and it's,

1239
00:59:01,331 --> 00:59:05,020
it's literally a part of their genetics.
It's in them,

1240
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:10,110
it's their DNA almost.
Or it is so this the republican white

1241
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:18,480
conservative idea that people need to
pull themselves up by their bootstraps,

1242
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:20,260
which is like,
you know the Cliche,

1243
00:59:20,261 --> 00:59:22,850
right?
They to get their shit together like

1244
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:24,800
God.
Is it more complicated than that?

1245
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:26,730
It is man.
But so here's the,

1246
00:59:26,731 --> 00:59:28,520
here's the interesting thing is I
applied,

1247
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:32,520
do think that I actually agree with that
in a different way.

1248
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:36,330
I think that you can never expect
anybody else to do any of that.

1249
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:39,870
Like the way it is.
You're born and raised in the way you

1250
00:59:39,871 --> 00:59:44,871
are and then at some point you fully
have to take responsibility for that.

1251
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,360
You know,
no matter how shitty or great in your

1252
00:59:48,361 --> 00:59:50,550
childhood was,
no matter what you're dealing with,

1253
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:54,150
I think that that there is no one else
that's going to do it for you.

1254
00:59:54,151 --> 00:59:57,470
So you,
I really do think that there's a,

1255
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:59,700
there is a piece of truth in what
they're saying.

1256
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:04,730
I just don't think that um,
that general mindset is nuanced or

1257
01:00:04,921 --> 01:00:08,250
understanding enough of what people are
working with that they're unrealistic

1258
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:09,570
about.
Yeah.

1259
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:10,350
I,
yeah,

1260
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:11,340
they might just be like,
well,

1261
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:14,390
what's conveniently aloof?
You know,

1262
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:19,670
they're conveniently ignorant about the
circumstances that are involved in

1263
01:00:20,411 --> 01:00:25,411
creating a child that grows up and has
been in juvenile detention since they

1264
01:00:25,901 --> 01:00:30,901
were a little kid and has been in and
out of all sorts of police custody and

1265
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:38,380
been in crime situations from the time
they were young to say that you need to

1266
01:00:38,381 --> 01:00:42,220
just straighten your act up.
Like they don't have any examples and

1267
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:45,940
the examples that they see on tv might
as well be them watching iron man.

1268
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:46,811
It's,
you know,

1269
01:00:46,811 --> 01:00:49,090
it just doesn't seem real.
It's not real.

1270
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:49,901
No.
And that's,

1271
01:00:49,901 --> 01:00:54,100
that's an issue I have with that whole
debate or political discussion or

1272
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:56,650
however you want to put it.
Is that it to be,

1273
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:00,850
it's only up there talking about a
situation and never as the actual

1274
01:01:00,851 --> 01:01:05,590
conversation being had a conversation
between people who had actually affects

1275
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:09,610
is rarely brought out and it's just a
bunch of people looking at things from

1276
01:01:09,611 --> 01:01:14,611
the outside and commenting and talking
about it and not actually digging into

1277
01:01:15,761 --> 01:01:17,650
it.
And it's just doesn't really,

1278
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:20,580
it doesn't serve anybody.
I don't feel like it serves anyone.

1279
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:23,900
Yeah.
And it's also like very dismissive.

1280
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:29,220
He was very dismissive of other people's
misfortune and not really appreciating

1281
01:01:29,931 --> 01:01:32,360
or understanding your fortune,
you know,

1282
01:01:32,361 --> 01:01:36,800
we're all born to come totally different
circumstances for the most part.

1283
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:41,720
And most of us here in America,
we were talking about this yesterday,

1284
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:47,050
that people that are in this country are
so much more fortunate than someone

1285
01:01:48,021 --> 01:01:50,150
who's born in some,
you know,

1286
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:54,620
terrible third world situation.
Like we were talking about Liberia.

1287
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,570
Yeah.
The reality of Liberia,

1288
01:01:56,571 --> 01:01:58,770
which is former,
uh,

1289
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:02,750
prison or not prison,
college slave colony with what they did

1290
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:07,751
was they took American slaves that were
released and they shipped them back to

1291
01:02:08,001 --> 01:02:11,870
Africa literally and created this
horrible,

1292
01:02:11,871 --> 01:02:14,500
horrible environment through,
you know,

1293
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:18,740
a bunch of different factors,
but several war being a big one of them.

1294
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:23,520
And vice has a really insightful and
amazing piece on,

1295
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:24,750
uh,
Liberia.

1296
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:27,780
I think it's vice guide to travel.
All my God,

1297
01:02:27,781 --> 01:02:29,690
it's an awful,
but you know,

1298
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:31,650
you can't say that,
you know,

1299
01:02:31,651 --> 01:02:36,651
being born to a blue collar,
white family in Cleveland is anything

1300
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:45,960
remotely as bad as being a child born in
Liberia or he can.

1301
01:02:45,961 --> 01:02:50,500
So,
and then looking at that person though,

1302
01:02:50,501 --> 01:02:53,100
the,
the child who's born in Cleveland,

1303
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:53,941
you know,
there's,

1304
01:02:53,941 --> 01:02:57,240
I'm sure there's a lot of kids that are
born there that wish,

1305
01:02:57,241 --> 01:02:58,050
fuck,
you know,

1306
01:02:58,050 --> 01:02:59,910
why couldn't I have been born in New
York City?

1307
01:02:59,911 --> 01:03:01,040
Or Fuck,
why couldn't I have been,

1308
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:02,440
you know,
it's,

1309
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:04,350
it's just,
again,

1310
01:03:04,351 --> 01:03:08,310
it comes back to what you were saying
about being a dad and the responsibility

1311
01:03:08,311 --> 01:03:13,311
of being a good person and being a
better person is that making and

1312
01:03:13,681 --> 01:03:18,681
developing human beings and creating a
community together with each human

1313
01:03:19,861 --> 01:03:24,810
beings is so incredibly difficult and
were handed this responsibility with no

1314
01:03:24,811 --> 01:03:25,800
instruction manual.

1315
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:26,890
No,
that's the thing.

1316
01:03:26,891 --> 01:03:28,840
No good leadership.
No instructions.

1317
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:30,370
No,
you're right man.

1318
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,233
Well

1319
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:35,410
leadership guys like you or some other
folks out there that are doing similar

1320
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:37,510
things that you can find,
you know,

1321
01:03:37,511 --> 01:03:39,280
but man,
if you don't find them,

1322
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:40,173
fuck

1323
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:41,790
yeah.
One,

1324
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:45,360
one thing I think it's really important
that you're kind of hitting not there or

1325
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:50,420
we're saying is
there's like a big leap to go from the

1326
01:03:51,271 --> 01:03:54,240
place of,
of blaming others and just feeling like

1327
01:03:54,241 --> 01:03:56,370
all my shitty,
like look at my book,

1328
01:03:56,371 --> 01:03:57,840
what I was eating and it was really
shitty.

1329
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:02,460
It's a big leap to go beyond that and
accept it.

1330
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:04,500
First of all,
no matter what it is,

1331
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:08,100
what you got going on in your life and
then even a bigger leap.

1332
01:04:08,101 --> 01:04:13,101
I think to start taking responsibility
for both yourself and other people.

1333
01:04:14,131 --> 01:04:14,851
You know,
I think,

1334
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:18,150
yeah,
I think that's what is,

1335
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,740
not that it's missing because it's out
there,

1336
01:04:19,741 --> 01:04:23,790
but I just think it could be like we got
time in our lives,

1337
01:04:23,791 --> 01:04:25,470
you know,
like we're doing okay in general in this

1338
01:04:25,471 --> 01:04:30,060
country.
I think we could take more time for each

1339
01:04:30,061 --> 01:04:32,080
other in that way.
Just across the board today,

1340
01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:35,100
whether that's in our schools or
whatever it is.

1341
01:04:35,101 --> 01:04:36,710
I don't know.
I don't have any answers.

1342
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,760
You have some answers.
I think you've got some great ideas,

1343
01:04:40,761 --> 01:04:45,761
but I think one of the things that we
talked about yesterday was the amount of

1344
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:51,550
children that you had communicated with
you had taught that found themselves in

1345
01:04:53,331 --> 01:04:57,320
some horrific situations that you had to
kind of experience with them.

1346
01:04:58,370 --> 01:05:03,370
And I think that human beings today,
at some point in time,

1347
01:05:04,551 --> 01:05:09,110
we have to realize that we are some sort
of a super organism.

1348
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:14,360
We are all connected.
And if this kid who grows up in this

1349
01:05:14,361 --> 01:05:18,280
horrible environment and is just a
abused

1350
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:23,280
and subject to all sorts of violence and
that kids can go perpetuate more of the

1351
01:05:23,651 --> 01:05:25,630
same,
if no one steps in,

1352
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:30,940
if no one offers some solid example that
you can do better,

1353
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:36,180
like some,
some sort of just some pathway through

1354
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:39,430
the bullshit and bullshit is not strong
enough worth.

1355
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:43,240
Yeah,
and for me like so I've spent a lot of

1356
01:05:43,241 --> 01:05:46,520
time thinking about and reading about
studying sort of both,

1357
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:49,510
both rites of passage at different parts
of the world,

1358
01:05:49,511 --> 01:05:54,070
but then also just this really simple
concept of mentoring or mentorship or

1359
01:05:54,071 --> 01:05:57,130
role models.
And I think I got real lucky like I had

1360
01:05:57,131 --> 01:05:59,320
an eye.
Not only did I have a good family and

1361
01:05:59,321 --> 01:06:01,060
good parents,
like amazing parents.

1362
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:04,870
I had,
I have this like string of role models

1363
01:06:04,871 --> 01:06:07,540
that I had from little kids.
So we've talked about this briefly

1364
01:06:07,541 --> 01:06:09,130
before,
but my first one was my taekwondo

1365
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:11,320
instructor at Russ kid best or Mike,
you know,

1366
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:14,410
like he was just,
I was super shy,

1367
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:19,300
super like very soft as a kid.
And then this dude in a sports car drove

1368
01:06:19,301 --> 01:06:20,500
into Drayton,
North Dakota.

1369
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:22,760
And I started taking taekwondo with him
and,

1370
01:06:22,761 --> 01:06:24,730
and he was just this,
you know,

1371
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:27,130
bad ass,
brash,

1372
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,780
strong,
confident guy.

1373
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:33,430
And then I looked up to him like I,
I attribute a lot of my,

1374
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:35,680
um,
the quality of the good qualities I

1375
01:06:35,681 --> 01:06:39,420
value about myself,
both to him and to taekwondo itself.

1376
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:41,050
Cause it,
it teaches them how to get teachers

1377
01:06:41,051 --> 01:06:44,020
great things to kids.
And so he was a mentor.

1378
01:06:44,021 --> 01:06:47,590
And then in high school I had this,
this farmer and worked on a pig farms

1379
01:06:47,591 --> 01:06:52,030
and he was John Weirs and we didn't talk
about shit,

1380
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:54,550
we didn't lie,
he didn't like fill me full of wisdom.

1381
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:58,190
What we did was just worked again the
work side by side and we shoveled pink

1382
01:06:58,191 --> 01:07:01,440
shit and dumped it on the field over and
over and over.

1383
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:04,480
And I went to college,
I had this great mentor who sort of,

1384
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:07,690
you know,
nonchalantly took me under his wing and

1385
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:10,420
kind of on and on throw my life,
man.

1386
01:07:10,421 --> 01:07:12,130
And I,
I dunno,

1387
01:07:12,131 --> 01:07:13,810
I've,
I've spent a lot of time thinking about

1388
01:07:13,811 --> 01:07:17,000
it and I really,
I just really wish that for,

1389
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,300
for people or want that for people,
you know,

1390
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,370
cause cause you can't rely on your
parents.

1391
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,740
You have everything you need in this
life.

1392
01:07:23,741 --> 01:07:25,370
It's just,
it's too much pressure for,

1393
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:28,140
well also I think,
well as we were talking about earlier,

1394
01:07:28,141 --> 01:07:31,800
their parents didn't know what the fuck
they were doing and their parents pass

1395
01:07:31,801 --> 01:07:36,801
didn't know what the fuck they're doing.
And for a lot of us that's,

1396
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,390
you know,
that's the reality that we find

1397
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:44,391
ourselves being born into.
But I think with doing with some of the

1398
01:07:44,791 --> 01:07:49,470
things that you've done and now also
with the amount of data and information

1399
01:07:49,471 --> 01:07:54,471
that's available today,
I think we have a chance of affecting

1400
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:59,880
our society and our culture and the way
we communicate with each other and just,

1401
01:08:00,270 --> 01:08:02,880
just who we are as a,
as a species.

1402
01:08:02,881 --> 01:08:04,080
This,
this crazy,

1403
01:08:04,081 --> 01:08:07,700
weird super organism of human beings.
We are,

1404
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,410
we're in a better position to change
that.

1405
01:08:10,450 --> 01:08:13,560
And then then ever before,
like my grandparents came over from

1406
01:08:13,561 --> 01:08:17,660
Italy and Ireland on a fucking boat.
Nobody knew what the hell was going on.

1407
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:19,580
Their parents didn't know shit and they
brought him over here.

1408
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,710
They just heard there was a better
chance.

1409
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:23,060
There's a,
there was an opportunity,

1410
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:26,480
I mean they might've saw a photo of what
New York looked like,

1411
01:08:26,481 --> 01:08:29,540
you know,
they might have and they took a chance

1412
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:33,410
and they came over here.
That the difference between them and

1413
01:08:33,630 --> 01:08:37,970
what the kind of experience and the kind
of access to information that your

1414
01:08:37,971 --> 01:08:40,940
children are going to have,
where my children are going to have.

1415
01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:43,640
It's fucking profound.
You know?

1416
01:08:43,641 --> 01:08:46,670
And I think we're at,
we're a part of something that's really

1417
01:08:46,671 --> 01:08:51,671
interesting right now and that the human
race is becoming hyper aware of all the

1418
01:08:52,881 --> 01:08:57,170
variables that are fucking it up.
And one of the big ones of course,

1419
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:01,910
is the abuse and mishandling and miss
raising of children.

1420
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:02,913
Yeah,
man.

1421
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:04,900
So yeah,
to that point,

1422
01:09:04,901 --> 01:09:06,820
there's this been,
this thing that I've been paying

1423
01:09:06,821 --> 01:09:11,350
attention to that I think is happening.
So as we have more information and it,

1424
01:09:11,351 --> 01:09:14,440
as things happen faster,
it has all of this compounds and things

1425
01:09:14,441 --> 01:09:15,310
go faster,
faster,

1426
01:09:15,311 --> 01:09:19,720
faster.
I think that the impact of slowing down

1427
01:09:20,110 --> 01:09:23,020
becomes very,
very valuable very,

1428
01:09:23,021 --> 01:09:24,160
very quickly.
So,

1429
01:09:24,161 --> 01:09:25,630
you know,
we're talking about all these wilderness

1430
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:30,400
experiences.
I also bring up like meditation or any

1431
01:09:30,401 --> 01:09:34,540
of these things.
I think that as other things speed up,

1432
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:39,570
I think that those are these things like
have the power to just smack you across

1433
01:09:40,481 --> 01:09:43,330
your face and like change six fast.
You know,

1434
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:44,830
I,
and I don't know if this has just been

1435
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:48,280
our observation for 10 years or so,
but I think that,

1436
01:09:48,281 --> 01:09:48,920
uh,
you know,

1437
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,880
150 years ago or whatever in the western
United States,

1438
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,520
if we had slow lives,
I don't think we would've had a huge

1439
01:09:54,521 --> 01:09:56,830
impact by going and camping for a week.

1440
01:09:57,130 --> 01:10:02,130
But today when you're pulled out of your
crazy digital electronic life and you go

1441
01:10:02,411 --> 01:10:06,670
back and we feel that human simplicity
for a little bit of time,

1442
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:11,140
I think the combination of the two
offers a really powerful place.

1443
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:13,930
Really crazy.
Because if you can get that awareness

1444
01:10:13,931 --> 01:10:16,690
and sort of that the impact of slowing
down.

1445
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:20,110
Yeah.
Compounded with all of the information

1446
01:10:20,111 --> 01:10:22,120
and the power and everything that we
have.

1447
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:23,860
I think it's,
I think so.

1448
01:10:23,861 --> 01:10:26,560
I think we're on the verge or a very
ripe place.

1449
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:28,210
I think it's a,
it's a time where,

1450
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,130
um,
you know,

1451
01:10:30,131 --> 01:10:33,130
people can,
can really change themselves all a lot

1452
01:10:33,131 --> 01:10:35,170
quicker or maybe even a lot more than
they think is.

1453
01:10:35,470 --> 01:10:40,240
That's another thing I would love for
people just to think or believe that

1454
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:42,220
things could be different,
that they could change.

1455
01:10:42,221 --> 01:10:43,280
You know,
because I,

1456
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:45,820
I mean,
that's what I've been involved in for so

1457
01:10:45,821 --> 01:10:47,320
long and it's just,
it is possible.

1458
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:51,190
Well,
I think also any kind of a trip,

1459
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:56,050
whether it's a meditative trip or even
just a camping trip or something where

1460
01:10:56,051 --> 01:10:59,680
you have that opportunity to sort of
reset and reassess,

1461
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:04,210
it gives you sovereignty,
gives you personal sovereignty instead

1462
01:11:04,211 --> 01:11:06,340
of just being just caught up in the
momentum.

1463
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:08,320
A buddy of mine,
my friend,

1464
01:11:08,321 --> 01:11:09,700
Ari,
should fear again,

1465
01:11:09,790 --> 01:11:11,950
bringing them up again.
It was with another buddy of mine,

1466
01:11:11,951 --> 01:11:13,890
big Jay Oakerson and they were,
uh,

1467
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:17,820
they were watching this couple make out
through a window.

1468
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:21,870
They were doing the podcast and uh,
they were on the roof and they were

1469
01:11:21,871 --> 01:11:24,750
watching this couple through the window.
It's a couple making out.

1470
01:11:24,751 --> 01:11:27,870
And then in the middle of making out,
they started checking their phones.

1471
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:32,670
This is,
this is what's going on today.

1472
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:34,440
I was kind of sad.
It's kind of sad,

1473
01:11:34,441 --> 01:11:37,380
but maybe they'd go suck in bed for the
better.

1474
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:38,700
But if,
you know,

1475
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:43,350
it's,
you got to not just have all this access

1476
01:11:43,351 --> 01:11:48,351
to data but also have the ability to
decide what you take in and what you

1477
01:11:50,161 --> 01:11:51,780
don't take care.
And I think that's,

1478
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,930
that's the,
we're passing the wildlife viewing area

1479
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:57,570
cause I went to,
well they think they're talking about

1480
01:11:57,571 --> 01:11:58,710
the humans that live here

1481
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:04,030
near in the middle of nowhere.
Yeah.

1482
01:12:04,031 --> 01:12:06,700
I think it's kind of super a super
charged time for that man.

1483
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,970
And it's cool to see people like
literally change your life.

1484
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,170
I,
one other thing,

1485
01:12:11,171 --> 01:12:12,120
I'm involved in his,
I,

1486
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:16,810
I started a men's group in Bozeman where
I live in Montana and I've been a part

1487
01:12:16,811 --> 01:12:18,520
of men's groups for a while,
a while,

1488
01:12:18,521 --> 01:12:22,540
probably six or seven years.
I think it's something that's really not

1489
01:12:22,541 --> 01:12:24,460
understood or really not even knowing
about,

1490
01:12:24,461 --> 01:12:29,170
but really odd is it's a group of guys
that get together to really practice

1491
01:12:29,171 --> 01:12:34,171
being completely real and I'm really
clear all the bullshit out of the way

1492
01:12:34,841 --> 01:12:37,750
and it's been incredibly helpful for me,
for me.

1493
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,150
Um,
where was I going with that?

1494
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:43,060
Oh yeah.
But just that I've been party are privy

1495
01:12:43,061 --> 01:12:46,960
to so many people just sort of like just
changing like,

1496
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:49,340
you know,
being a lot more fucking happy and a lot

1497
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:54,380
more productive and I think it's easy to
get stuck in thinking that things just

1498
01:12:54,461 --> 01:12:57,190
are how they are and what sovereignty is
huge.

1499
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:59,710
That's the biggest thing.
Like owning what you feel,

1500
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:02,440
honoring what you want,
owning who you are,

1501
01:13:02,650 --> 01:13:03,300
all of that.

1502
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,280
Well,
it's also a lot of times people that get

1503
01:13:05,281 --> 01:13:08,720
out of high school to going to college
and get out of college and get a job and

1504
01:13:08,721 --> 01:13:12,570
get a job and start the career they push
forth and their career and before they

1505
01:13:12,571 --> 01:13:17,571
know what they're fucking 40 years old
and they can't stop the momentum of the

1506
01:13:19,021 --> 01:13:20,970
life and then not enjoying it.

1507
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:21,941
No,
they're desperate,

1508
01:13:21,941 --> 01:13:22,850
dude.
They're quiet.

1509
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:23,860
They're quietly desperate.

1510
01:13:24,010 --> 01:13:25,510
Yeah.
It wasn't that Toro.

1511
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:28,150
Most men lead lives of quiet
desperation.

1512
01:13:28,190 --> 01:13:30,400
It's such a great fucking quote.

1513
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:34,490
So why aren't we teaching every 17 year
old kid who's coming out of high school

1514
01:13:34,491 --> 01:13:35,360
like,
Hey,

1515
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:38,060
that's,
that's probably your future.

1516
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:39,950
You know,
once you get on top of this.

1517
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:43,270
No.
How you teach people like this.

1518
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,450
Yeah.
They listen to podcasts to hear people

1519
01:13:46,451 --> 01:13:49,840
talk.
They realize that their parents didn't

1520
01:13:49,841 --> 01:13:53,210
have a fucking awesome information,
you know,

1521
01:13:53,230 --> 01:13:57,340
and look a lot of pants,
they mean the right thing when they tell

1522
01:13:57,341 --> 01:13:59,920
them get a good job.
Don't take any chances.

1523
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:01,143
You know,
y'all,

1524
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,420
you got a dream,
Huh?

1525
01:14:02,450 --> 01:14:02,861
Yeah,
I will.

1526
01:14:02,861 --> 01:14:04,420
Uh,
dreams don't pay the bills.

1527
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:07,210
They don't,
they're not doing that because they're

1528
01:14:07,211 --> 01:14:10,300
assholes for the most part.
They're doing that because that's been

1529
01:14:10,301 --> 01:14:11,890
their experience,
their life.

1530
01:14:11,891 --> 01:14:14,230
And they don't want their kid to be a
fucking idiot.

1531
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,870
And they don't,
they don't understand.

1532
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:18,670
They don't.
They don't know.

1533
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:20,830
But,
so listen up fuckers,

1534
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:22,090
like,
look around,

1535
01:14:22,091 --> 01:14:24,880
look around,
look around and notice how many adults

1536
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:29,940
either have shitty lives they don't like
or are like going through massive

1537
01:14:30,041 --> 01:14:33,760
amounts of self help or therapy or all
these things at all ages.

1538
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:35,410
And not,
you know,

1539
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:36,790
too.
What are you thinking antidepressants

1540
01:14:36,791 --> 01:14:40,540
come from?
Did that many people have broken brains

1541
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:42,530
or is there,
I'm,

1542
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:45,970
I'm not denying that there's most
certainly quite a few people that have

1543
01:14:45,971 --> 01:14:50,140
natural chemical imbalances and
pharmaceutical drugs can benefit them.

1544
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:51,100
That's,
that's true.

1545
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:52,510
Absolutely.
No doubt about it.

1546
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:57,490
But I know for a fact there's a lot of
people who get medicated because they

1547
01:14:57,491 --> 01:15:01,450
fucking hate their lives.
Instead of picking a life that you enjoy

1548
01:15:01,451 --> 01:15:05,920
or working towards developing your life.
And it's something that you would enjoy,

1549
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:07,910
you know?
And one of the,

1550
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,380
some of the most satisfying,
uh,

1551
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,770
email and twitter,
tweets,

1552
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,450
twitters,
tweet messages,

1553
01:15:13,451 --> 01:15:15,880
and facebook things that I've ever
gotten is people that have listened to

1554
01:15:15,881 --> 01:15:17,410
this podcast and said,
you know what?

1555
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:22,450
I realized I am 36 and I,
I've always wanted to do this and I'm

1556
01:15:22,451 --> 01:15:24,850
going to quit my fucking job,
but I'm gonna figure out how to do that.

1557
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:27,940
I'm going to work towards that.
I'm going to save up some money and I'm

1558
01:15:27,941 --> 01:15:30,700
gonna fucking whatever it is I'm going
to make pottery.

1559
01:15:30,701 --> 01:15:33,350
I'm going to start fucking selling my
paintings.

1560
01:15:33,351 --> 01:15:37,210
So whatever the fuck it is,
everybody's got a thing.

1561
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:40,000
And if you don't have a thing,
find the fucking thing.

1562
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:45,220
But you can't think that that whole like
work,

1563
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:49,200
get a good job,
get your benefits and,

1564
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:51,580
and don't,
don't do anything stupid because you

1565
01:15:51,581 --> 01:15:53,860
don't want to get fired.
That life is bullshit.

1566
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:56,260
That is bullshit life.
Totally.

1567
01:15:56,890 --> 01:16:01,180
If you got a good job that you enjoy,
that's a great life and then your job

1568
01:16:01,181 --> 01:16:02,980
doesn't feel like a job.
I mean,

1569
01:16:02,981 --> 01:16:05,320
even though it's,
it can be challenging and difficult.

1570
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,630
If you could find something you actually
enjoy doing,

1571
01:16:07,631 --> 01:16:12,610
your life will be immeasurably better
than if you're just grinding it out

1572
01:16:12,611 --> 01:16:17,520
waiting for that five o'clock fucking
Buzzer to come right away.

1573
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:19,990
I like to talk about it though.
I think he's a really important

1574
01:16:19,991 --> 01:16:24,130
difference is to be descriptive rather
than prescriptive.

1575
01:16:24,131 --> 01:16:26,650
Because if you try to force yourself
into,

1576
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:30,310
if you're trying to be Joe Rogan or if
you're trying to be anybody else out

1577
01:16:30,311 --> 01:16:32,010
there,
you want that life like,

1578
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:34,420
like good luck with that in the long
run.

1579
01:16:34,421 --> 01:16:39,070
Like I feel like you have to sink into
yourself and just actually fucking be

1580
01:16:39,071 --> 01:16:41,080
who you are like that.
It's hard to find though,

1581
01:16:41,081 --> 01:16:42,880
right?
It is hard to find who you are.

1582
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:44,370
It totally is.
But that's the,

1583
01:16:44,530 --> 01:16:48,590
I think that's your job until you're,
until you are who you are and that's

1584
01:16:48,591 --> 01:16:50,350
wrong the way,
don't be embarrassed if you're

1585
01:16:50,351 --> 01:16:53,380
pretending to be somebody else.
Cause I think we all get that when

1586
01:16:53,381 --> 01:16:57,010
you're trying to find yourself telling.
Me and I most certainly have been

1587
01:16:57,011 --> 01:17:00,470
massively influenced by a lot of people
that I respected and,

1588
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:04,240
and,
and listen to them or watch them or saw

1589
01:17:04,241 --> 01:17:05,800
their work or whatever it is.

1590
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:11,220
That's okay as long as you eventually
figure out who you are and then it kind

1591
01:17:11,571 --> 01:17:13,580
of happened to you before you even know
it.

1592
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:15,650
Like when I was young man,
I always,

1593
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:18,680
I never felt very secure and I always
was like,

1594
01:17:18,681 --> 01:17:22,910
God,
I wish I could fucking be someone.

1595
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:26,570
Like all these people that I admire.
Like I wish I could figure out how to be

1596
01:17:26,571 --> 01:17:29,600
me instead of wishing I was all these
other people.

1597
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:31,520
And somewhere along the line,
it's just Kinda,

1598
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:35,570
if you pursue what you actually enjoy,
it kind of happens totally.

1599
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:39,140
But it's not,
it's not an easy process and it's a

1600
01:17:39,141 --> 01:17:42,860
process of self reflection and you gotta
be honest.

1601
01:17:42,861 --> 01:17:45,260
And that's where these moments that
you're talking about,

1602
01:17:45,261 --> 01:17:49,100
like meditative moments or moments where
you can go to the mountains and be by

1603
01:17:49,101 --> 01:17:51,800
yourself.
Those moments are huge because they give

1604
01:17:51,801 --> 01:17:56,801
you this opportunity to maybe examine
your ideas a little more closely instead

1605
01:17:58,221 --> 01:18:00,980
of just constantly being,
Eh,

1606
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:04,660
just inundated with other people's
opinions about what you,

1607
01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:06,500
you should have your own experiences,
man.

1608
01:18:06,530 --> 01:18:08,630
You gotta just,
you just got to live and you got to

1609
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:10,490
experiences.
That's what I think you've got to

1610
01:18:10,491 --> 01:18:13,790
experience as much as you can.
Whether that's a trip around the world

1611
01:18:13,791 --> 01:18:18,230
are traveling or to a different place or
a hallucinogenic experience it done in a

1612
01:18:18,231 --> 01:18:21,560
safe way or whatever it is.
I just feel like you got to,

1613
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,660
yeah,
to find yourself.

1614
01:18:23,661 --> 01:18:24,321
You'd be,
you gotta.

1615
01:18:24,321 --> 01:18:27,350
You gotta test the waters.
He got wires all over them.

1616
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:29,570
And if you're born in this fucking town
that we're driving through,

1617
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:34,430
good luck
handing out cash pay day loans.

1618
01:18:34,730 --> 01:18:36,740
Man,
I grew up in a place way smaller and

1619
01:18:36,741 --> 01:18:39,570
tidier than this real review.
Dan Dodi is,

1620
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:43,070
he made it through 600 people.
600 how many of them you fuck?

1621
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,360
We left.
We left when I was in sixth grade.

1622
01:18:47,361 --> 01:18:51,500
So unfortunately these are
probably better off that way.

1623
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:53,180
What's your fuck people they think
getting the,

1624
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:54,053
Oh,
I'm sorry.

1625
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:55,420
Jesus.
Kate.

1626
01:18:55,421 --> 01:18:57,870
Just leave me alone.
Oh

1627
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:02,630
Shit.
Out of here.

1628
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:04,580
I got super lucky man.
So yeah,

1629
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:08,840
I grew up in a tiny little place.
10 miles from the Canadian border of

1630
01:19:08,841 --> 01:19:11,000
North Dakota.
Just like nothing going on.

1631
01:19:11,001 --> 01:19:12,170
You know,
maybe this place.

1632
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:15,800
Gasoline Alley.
Speedway casino.

1633
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:20,630
There's a casino in there that's a
casino and a 24 hour gas station.

1634
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:22,430
Fuck,
you can hit it big.

1635
01:19:22,431 --> 01:19:23,500
They're,
yeah.

1636
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:27,590
Cash loans on car titles.
That's the fucking title of the

1637
01:19:27,591 --> 01:19:30,920
goddamned store.
Cash loans on car titles.

1638
01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:33,880
How many people give up their cars here
for alone?

1639
01:19:34,530 --> 01:19:36,100
Wow.
Is this fallon?

1640
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:37,800
Um,
it's not,

1641
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:39,760
it's not even say what it is.
Okay.

1642
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,440
For bastards,
wherever this is.

1643
01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:43,423
Yeah.
This was

1644
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:47,840
Stockman's casino spin.
And when Saturdays come play,

1645
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:51,340
yeah.
A lot of people you read smoking going

1646
01:19:51,341 --> 01:19:53,030
on there.
I bought a cigarette smoking.

1647
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:56,150
A lot of people here can describe with a
gun tastes like in your mouth.

1648
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:03,080
It doesn't taste good,
it doesn't taste good,

1649
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:08,100
but it seems like if you know that,
that that's a possibility.

1650
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:12,540
What a strange places.
There's a lot of these places that we

1651
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:14,430
drove through.
Like how about that one?

1652
01:20:14,431 --> 01:20:17,840
Wild West town there was established in
1865,

1653
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:23,070
I don't remember the name of it,
but they had the old buildings there

1654
01:20:23,071 --> 01:20:28,071
that were there from 1865 that were in
ruins and various state of disarray and

1655
01:20:28,701 --> 01:20:31,070
decay surrounded by these,
uh,

1656
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:35,430
more new modern ruins that people were
living in.

1657
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:36,570
Well,
yeah,

1658
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:39,270
the old ones.
Yeah.

1659
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,250
Yeah,
they did cause they,

1660
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:45,870
they got something.
There's some class or some weird about

1661
01:20:45,871 --> 01:20:50,550
like
mobile homes and like really shitty

1662
01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:53,280
aluminum siding and stuff.
You know?

1663
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:55,740
No one's ever going to be pumped to find
that someday.

1664
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:57,840
No.
You mean like a hundred years from now

1665
01:20:57,841 --> 01:21:00,720
or 3000 years from now if you find an
old bar,

1666
01:21:00,721 --> 01:21:03,810
like that old barn that we were passing
and that little shack or whatever

1667
01:21:03,811 --> 01:21:06,840
fucking was it cooled cabin of
distressed wood.

1668
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,950
You look at that and you go,
wow,

1669
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:11,790
that's kind of bad ass.
No one's going to like look at some

1670
01:21:11,791 --> 01:21:16,060
shitty old aluminum sided fucked up
house.

1671
01:21:16,130 --> 01:21:18,210
What you're saying is quality spans
time.

1672
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:21,360
That American flags a little too big for
my liking.

1673
01:21:21,370 --> 01:21:23,790
It's at half mast.
Did somebody die while we were in the

1674
01:21:23,791 --> 01:21:25,710
woods?
Some shit.

1675
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:29,760
But when a flags at half mast,
that's what it means.

1676
01:21:29,761 --> 01:21:32,100
Right?
We missed something.

1677
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:35,940
We probably don't know a lot of fucking
things that went down for seven days.

1678
01:21:36,510 --> 01:21:40,260
That's gotta be a good thing.
We know that two Olympic swimmers got

1679
01:21:40,261 --> 01:21:43,770
robbed at gunpoint in Brazil.
Way to go.

1680
01:21:43,820 --> 01:21:44,720
Do you feel better knowing that?

1681
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:45,900
No,
no,

1682
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,340
no,
no.

1683
01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:48,870
I feel like,
ah,

1684
01:21:48,871 --> 01:21:53,280
I feel better that I was in the woods
and I wasn't in cabin Brazil with a gun

1685
01:21:53,281 --> 01:21:57,120
pointed at my head.
Poor bastards.

1686
01:21:57,690 --> 01:21:58,523
But no,

1687
01:21:58,630 --> 01:21:59,630
there's a lot of,
uh,

1688
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:03,000
we have to look,
we should know that that's possible.

1689
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:07,110
That people can get robbed like a,
when you hear about terrible things in

1690
01:22:07,111 --> 01:22:10,230
the world,
the good news or the good fact about

1691
01:22:10,231 --> 01:22:13,190
that is now you know those things
without having,

1692
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:17,640
it's not like you live your life in some
sort of a Mormon missionary factory and

1693
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:21,810
then they send you out there to the
awful parts of the world and all of a

1694
01:22:21,811 --> 01:22:22,411
sudden,
you know,

1695
01:22:22,411 --> 01:22:26,370
you're in some third world country and
you don't realize it's being run by a

1696
01:22:26,371 --> 01:22:28,640
brutal dictator.
And what's a dictator like,

1697
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:30,960
you know,
North Korea.

1698
01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:34,080
What is it like?
It's good to know that North Korea is

1699
01:22:34,081 --> 01:22:38,430
out there and there's some Kim Jong Un
type dudes in the world.

1700
01:22:40,430 --> 01:22:42,800
Yes.
When I was little when I was a kid,

1701
01:22:43,490 --> 01:22:46,210
but not all the time and definitely not
a gun point.

1702
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,200
I got in the wrong cap once and the
border of Ecuador and Peru and got stuck

1703
01:22:51,201 --> 01:22:53,450
up,
they call it soft kidnapped,

1704
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:56,950
where uh,
this other dude got the back of the text

1705
01:22:56,951 --> 01:22:58,370
and they started driving out in the
jungle.

1706
01:22:59,790 --> 01:23:02,520
Oh Shit.
Asking me questions about politics and

1707
01:23:02,521 --> 01:23:05,220
my family and all this stuff.
Oh my God,

1708
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,030
I didn't really know.
I was just,

1709
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,400
I was down there learning Spanish.
I didn't know a global yet.

1710
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:11,380
And um,
I basically said,

1711
01:23:11,381 --> 01:23:14,080
listen guys a fucking got nothing.
I have like 40 bucks.

1712
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:18,100
Right.
So they drove me to an ATM and I'm like,

1713
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:18,670
I got,
I got,

1714
01:23:18,670 --> 01:23:22,810
I got like 80 bucks more out of them are
out and they gave it to him and then ran

1715
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:24,820
like fucking just took off.
Wow.

1716
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:26,980
That was pretty sketchy.
That's the other thing that happened in

1717
01:23:26,981 --> 01:23:30,340
Brazil recently presented Jujitsu
student from Australia,

1718
01:23:30,341 --> 01:23:33,610
I believe was out there.
He got kidnapped by these cops.

1719
01:23:33,940 --> 01:23:37,420
Cops took him to two ATM machines and
made them withdraw money.

1720
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,560
Yeah.
Yeah.

1721
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:40,790
Cops,
cops.

1722
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:44,920
Fuck
you want to trust them.

1723
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:48,070
But you know what man?
It's like again,

1724
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:51,220
what the fuck happened to them and what
happened?

1725
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:54,040
What happened to these people that are
robbing these people?

1726
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:56,260
Something bad.
They,

1727
01:23:56,470 --> 01:24:00,790
it's not necessarily 100% their fault
that that's who they've become.

1728
01:24:01,630 --> 01:24:06,280
I'm not taking away ownership of their
own actions,

1729
01:24:06,281 --> 01:24:10,780
but you got to think about the
development of their ideas,

1730
01:24:10,990 --> 01:24:14,680
how it happened.
I had this friend of mine on the podcast

1731
01:24:14,681 --> 01:24:19,150
recently and he was talking about,
he grew up in a standards Byron bowers

1732
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:24,500
and he grew up in a really poor area of
Georgia and a lot of crime where he was

1733
01:24:25,940 --> 01:24:30,940
just a lot of like really fucked up
family environments and he was saying

1734
01:24:31,121 --> 01:24:35,170
that when we thought about like robin
something like go into a store and

1735
01:24:35,171 --> 01:24:37,930
stealing something,
we didn't think it was a bad thing

1736
01:24:38,170 --> 01:24:40,570
because that's how you get it.
That's how you get things.

1737
01:24:40,571 --> 01:24:43,210
You've got to go get it,
you got to go steal and that it was

1738
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:45,020
just,
that's what you grew up.

1739
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:50,050
Now he's a successful comedian and he's
doing well and it's like he can step

1740
01:24:50,591 --> 01:24:55,591
back and have the hindsight vision of
his current state and like realize like,

1741
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:00,100
oh,
that was why I thought that way.

1742
01:25:00,150 --> 01:25:00,983
Yeah.
Yeah.

1743
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:06,640
And I'm sure these guys that robbed you,
I mean they didn't have a fucking pretty

1744
01:25:06,641 --> 01:25:07,660
upbringing.
There was nothing,

1745
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:10,810
it's not like they went from a gated
community to robin people in Peru.

1746
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,340
No,
it's not like they are doing it because

1747
01:25:12,341 --> 01:25:14,830
they were just morally poor people,
you know?

1748
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:16,990
I mean I don't think so.
They were.

1749
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,420
Maybe they were,
but what made them that way?

1750
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:23,200
Think about your own little boy.
He's two months old.

1751
01:25:23,530 --> 01:25:28,530
I mean you get to shape what that boy
becomes as he becomes a man and someone

1752
01:25:29,921 --> 01:25:32,350
did that to the Guy who robbed you in
Peru,

1753
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:33,640
you know?
I mean that is,

1754
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:38,320
that's how it goes.
I mean it really sort of highlights the

1755
01:25:38,321 --> 01:25:42,730
bizarre nature of humans raising humans.
We should really be raised by robots.

1756
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:45,310
We should,
yeah,

1757
01:25:45,311 --> 01:25:47,890
someone should come along and just make
the perfect human razor.

1758
01:25:48,490 --> 01:25:49,960
Now obviously not,
you know,

1759
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,520
you're,
I'm sure you're going to do a great job,

1760
01:25:51,521 --> 01:25:54,010
but for people who,
whose parents are going to do a shitty

1761
01:25:54,011 --> 01:25:56,410
job,
I wonder if they're going to come up

1762
01:25:56,411 --> 01:25:58,960
with technology one day and I think they
will,

1763
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:04,010
that will be able to install better
memories and a better pattern of

1764
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:07,070
behavior in a person's brain.
Like almost like they're going to be

1765
01:26:07,071 --> 01:26:09,160
able to defrag your hard drive.
Sure.

1766
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:11,510
You mean just like with a click of a
switch,

1767
01:26:11,511 --> 01:26:14,870
but he's a little hook you up to him.
Like say if somebody gave you a

1768
01:26:14,871 --> 01:26:15,681
computer,
right?

1769
01:26:15,681 --> 01:26:17,810
But it has a virus on it.
It's all fucked up.

1770
01:26:17,811 --> 01:26:21,320
Every time you check your email and
sends you dick pictures and it takes you

1771
01:26:21,321 --> 01:26:23,720
to rush an escort sites like you mother
fuckers,

1772
01:26:23,721 --> 01:26:26,510
which you did in my phone.
If the your your computer,

1773
01:26:26,511 --> 01:26:27,650
your computer is fucked,
right,

1774
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:30,470
dude.
But if you bring it down to the computer

1775
01:26:30,471 --> 01:26:31,161
store,
the guy can go,

1776
01:26:31,161 --> 01:26:32,210
oh,
you got a virus.

1777
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:34,070
Here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna,

1778
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:38,990
we're gonna wipe your hard drive clean,
reinstall your operating system,

1779
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:42,170
and then I'll back up your crucial files
and add them later.

1780
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:43,660
Sure.
That's,

1781
01:26:43,850 --> 01:26:47,090
that's got to be the future of human
beings.

1782
01:26:47,210 --> 01:26:50,420
I think you're totally right.
But I think that there's some things

1783
01:26:50,421 --> 01:26:54,260
that are acting in that way already.
There's participate in your child's

1784
01:26:54,261 --> 01:26:55,970
life,
even if it's uncomfortable suit,

1785
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,300
man,
what the fuck?

1786
01:26:57,620 --> 01:26:58,401
Massive.
No,

1787
01:26:58,401 --> 01:26:59,450
they're sharing the message.
I know,

1788
01:26:59,451 --> 01:27:02,210
but what is that?
If it's uncomfortable,

1789
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:06,850
even if it's an that's a billboard here,
the middle of nowhere participating in

1790
01:27:06,851 --> 01:27:08,990
your child's life,
even if it's uncomfortable.

1791
01:27:09,110 --> 01:27:12,200
Who though?
Fuck sees that billboard and goes,

1792
01:27:12,201 --> 01:27:16,040
you know what?
I'm going to stop ignoring my kids doing

1793
01:27:16,041 --> 01:27:19,360
math.
I'm going to participate even if it's

1794
01:27:19,370 --> 01:27:21,500
uncomfortable because I need my math.
Well,

1795
01:27:21,501 --> 01:27:23,810
fuck man.
If that sign makes it happen for one

1796
01:27:23,811 --> 01:27:25,140
fucking kid.
Yeah,

1797
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:26,850
you're right.
You're right.

1798
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:30,320
I would,
I was saying there's a lot of recent

1799
01:27:31,130 --> 01:27:34,520
research and study that that has
happened,

1800
01:27:34,521 --> 01:27:35,354
specifically

1801
01:27:35,430 --> 01:27:37,640
ptsd and in,
in that realm

1802
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:44,260
that shows how memories and our
experiences when we're young and older,

1803
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:49,960
how they truly are stored in our body
and that there are techniques available

1804
01:27:50,841 --> 01:27:54,530
now that truly can unlock and free
those.

1805
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:55,510
And it's,
it's,

1806
01:27:56,140 --> 01:28:01,140
it's not psychology in the sense of just
talk therapy or just figuring things out

1807
01:28:01,161 --> 01:28:02,570
or analyzing.
I think it's,

1808
01:28:02,571 --> 01:28:06,020
it's,
it's much more a body body based.

1809
01:28:06,021 --> 01:28:10,130
So the idea is that if there is an
experience that happens,

1810
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:14,450
the natural human ranges too,
if it's overwhelming,

1811
01:28:14,451 --> 01:28:15,800
right?
You fight,

1812
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:21,220
you run or flight or you freeze.
And it's the freezing that these people

1813
01:28:23,961 --> 01:28:28,520
will argue that things literally get
like locked and etched into your bodies,

1814
01:28:28,521 --> 01:28:31,040
either yourselves or your musculature.
Well,

1815
01:28:31,070 --> 01:28:32,420
I dunno what,
wherever it is,

1816
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:36,740
but that through processes of awareness
and relaxation and,

1817
01:28:36,741 --> 01:28:40,200
and being able to go into that,
you really can open and release a lot of

1818
01:28:40,201 --> 01:28:40,300
that.

1819
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:43,430
So it's not an automatic hit a button
defrag the entire thing.

1820
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:46,190
But there are things that people do
that,

1821
01:28:46,370 --> 01:28:49,640
that truly work in that way and in that
direction.

1822
01:28:49,670 --> 01:28:53,840
And it's not mainstream at all.
You know,

1823
01:28:53,930 --> 01:28:56,840
I think it will be one day and actually
really think it will be.

1824
01:28:57,350 --> 01:29:00,200
Um,
but I think that there's proof now that

1825
01:29:00,201 --> 01:29:03,690
things are more malleable,
our memories are more malleable,

1826
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:08,730
are sort of set patterns,
although they're very firm can be

1827
01:29:08,731 --> 01:29:10,860
shifted.
And I think there's a lot of hope in

1828
01:29:10,861 --> 01:29:12,120
that.
I think it's really cool.

1829
01:29:12,121 --> 01:29:12,954
I,
I don't,

1830
01:29:13,170 --> 01:29:16,460
I don't feel like that's an accepted
viewpoint at this point.

1831
01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:18,060
Well,
I think it's being more and more

1832
01:29:18,061 --> 01:29:20,400
accepted.
I think people are understanding now

1833
01:29:20,401 --> 01:29:25,401
more and more that there's a method that
the human mind has sort of undergone in

1834
01:29:26,851 --> 01:29:28,950
order to take these memories in the
first place.

1835
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:34,160
And if there's a way to reexamine those
initial ideas and form new ideas based

1836
01:29:36,450 --> 01:29:41,280
on better data and a better
understanding of how your actual,

1837
01:29:41,310 --> 01:29:44,520
your mind works.
Very few people know how their mind

1838
01:29:44,521 --> 01:29:47,700
works.
They just know that I get mad when this

1839
01:29:47,701 --> 01:29:48,534
happens.
Sure.

1840
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:51,460
This pisses me off.
And you know what,

1841
01:29:51,570 --> 01:29:55,620
one thing that's uh,
a beautiful idea that has been going

1842
01:29:55,621 --> 01:30:00,621
around is look at something when it
happens and decide how to make that a

1843
01:30:03,901 --> 01:30:08,901
positive for you and decide how to give
that thing meaning because nothing truly

1844
01:30:09,751 --> 01:30:12,810
has any meaning other than the meaning
that you give it.

1845
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:17,700
And the meaning that I might have to
something might be very different than

1846
01:30:17,701 --> 01:30:19,710
you would have for the exact same
experience.

1847
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:23,940
And we don't even know who's right or
wrong until you look at like where that

1848
01:30:23,941 --> 01:30:25,750
path takes you.
And I might look at it,

1849
01:30:25,751 --> 01:30:27,960
go,
you know what 10 toady was right.

1850
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:29,940
I should just let that brush off my
shoulders.

1851
01:30:29,941 --> 01:30:31,920
Look,
he did and now he's doing great.

1852
01:30:32,110 --> 01:30:34,020
Me.
I'm still carrying around that one

1853
01:30:34,021 --> 01:30:35,550
fucked up experience.
Yeah.

1854
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:39,480
I mean there's people that are still
repeating arguments that they had in the

1855
01:30:39,481 --> 01:30:42,050
ninth grade while they're in their car.
They're sitting there going,

1856
01:30:42,070 --> 01:30:44,940
this motherfucker thinks you can get
away with that off to cause us.

1857
01:30:45,210 --> 01:30:46,550
Oh,
go fucking foreign number.

1858
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,390
I know for sure tomorrow,
girl.

1859
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:49,253
Ooh,
yeah,

1860
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,193
yeah.
There's a lot of,

1861
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:54,660
a lot of stuff that we carry around in
our brains and we don't know why it's

1862
01:30:54,661 --> 01:30:57,270
even there.
It's just bouncing around and he got to

1863
01:30:57,271 --> 01:30:58,840
do a cleanup,
uh,

1864
01:30:59,000 --> 01:30:59,833
de Frag.

1865
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:03,070
Yeah.
Well I think one of the best tools to

1866
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:06,220
begin that entire process is simple
mindfulness practices,

1867
01:31:06,221 --> 01:31:08,500
which are,
so what that means is that when

1868
01:31:08,501 --> 01:31:12,550
something fucked up happens and you're
going to immediately have that knee jerk

1869
01:31:12,551 --> 01:31:14,410
reaction,
all it is is that you,

1870
01:31:14,411 --> 01:31:16,550
you have,
you keep it a little fucking space and

1871
01:31:16,551 --> 01:31:19,660
you let it be there and then you can
decide to freak out or do whatever you

1872
01:31:19,661 --> 01:31:20,060
want.

1873
01:31:20,060 --> 01:31:23,630
Give it a lot of space.
Give it a lot of space and think about

1874
01:31:23,631 --> 01:31:24,620
it.
Don't,

1875
01:31:24,621 --> 01:31:29,621
don't let the momentum of every event
run your life because you'll just be

1876
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:34,901
bouncing from one catastrophe to the
next and mindfulness is like a term that

1877
01:31:36,081 --> 01:31:39,830
gets really bandied about a lot lately,
but I think the way you're describing it

1878
01:31:39,831 --> 01:31:43,220
as she is very important like under
examine these things.

1879
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:44,370
Yeah,
it is.

1880
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:44,751
It is.
It,

1881
01:31:44,751 --> 01:31:46,370
well,
it's an overused terminance and a

1882
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,220
misunderstood term,
but I think in,

1883
01:31:48,430 --> 01:31:51,810
it's a very simple,
practical way.

1884
01:31:51,811 --> 01:31:55,160
It's just being able to just being aware
of what's happening,

1885
01:31:55,210 --> 01:31:55,750
you know,

1886
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:58,030
and being in the moment,
being in the moment.

1887
01:31:58,031 --> 01:32:00,490
Don't live in the past.
Thinking about the argument that you got

1888
01:32:00,491 --> 01:32:03,130
in the ninth grade.
Don't think about your future.

1889
01:32:03,131 --> 01:32:06,730
Only think about this moment right now
because this is what you have.

1890
01:32:07,030 --> 01:32:09,460
Look,
you and I are in this car driving down

1891
01:32:09,461 --> 01:32:12,940
this godforsaken shit hole highway.
We could get hit in the head with a

1892
01:32:12,941 --> 01:32:15,760
fucking media before this podcast even
makes it to the Internet.

1893
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:18,440
We don't know.
We're assuming right now as we speak in

1894
01:32:18,441 --> 01:32:19,810
the dimension of this is going to get
out,

1895
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,060
but it might not.
It might not.

1896
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:26,700
I like what you said about you know,
taking things as learning opportunities,

1897
01:32:27,350 --> 01:32:31,080
you know in general that that just
anything in life that happens to you,

1898
01:32:31,081 --> 01:32:34,620
whether it's good or bad is an
opportunity you can capitalize them.

1899
01:32:34,621 --> 01:32:36,090
Just cause you can learn from it.
You know

1900
01:32:36,170 --> 01:32:37,310
you can,
it's just,

1901
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:40,430
it's hard to break free of the parents
and you used to have,

1902
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:44,390
that's where I really advocate self help
books,

1903
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:45,890
you know?
Even though like a lot of people think

1904
01:32:45,891 --> 01:32:49,490
self help books are bullshit.
You know why their bullshit because most

1905
01:32:49,491 --> 01:32:52,190
people don't really listen.
They don't really know.

1906
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:56,090
They don't do anything to try to change
the pattern of behavior that they're

1907
01:32:56,091 --> 01:32:58,760
stuck in.
They just read the book and you go,

1908
01:32:58,790 --> 01:33:03,530
oh well they don't do anything.
You've got to do something about it.

1909
01:33:03,531 --> 01:33:06,280
But being inspired,
you know,

1910
01:33:06,740 --> 01:33:10,980
even sometimes a fucking really good
movie can change your life because it,

1911
01:33:10,981 --> 01:33:14,480
it'll make a little incremental change
in a certain direction.

1912
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:18,840
And then over time,
that could be a gigantic factor in

1913
01:33:18,841 --> 01:33:23,330
determining your happiness or your
unhappiness depending on like how you

1914
01:33:23,331 --> 01:33:24,770
choose to behave and think.

1915
01:33:24,890 --> 01:33:27,800
Yeah,
I think there's a big stigma to against

1916
01:33:28,010 --> 01:33:30,820
self help.
And then I think for guys especially,

1917
01:33:30,830 --> 01:33:35,300
but probably for everybody that we just
got to get over that shit,

1918
01:33:36,830 --> 01:33:40,310
you know,
it's got gotta be okay and I don't know

1919
01:33:40,370 --> 01:33:45,370
because all of that self help spiritual
type stuff that's,

1920
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:51,140
you know,
made fun of and made fun of for good

1921
01:33:51,141 --> 01:33:51,810
reasons.
But,

1922
01:33:51,810 --> 01:33:53,810
but there's some,
there's some things in there that,

1923
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:56,820
that aren't all that right.

1924
01:33:56,980 --> 01:34:00,430
There's been just incredibly health
Yonis patellas calling us,

1925
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:07,780
don't get no fuck you hang up on him.
How's it going to,

1926
01:34:07,790 --> 01:34:09,460
I was going to talk to him and say
something silly,

1927
01:34:09,461 --> 01:34:11,680
but we're,
when a podcast,

1928
01:34:11,681 --> 01:34:14,890
Yani,
I hope you understand 60 miles outside

1929
01:34:14,891 --> 01:34:16,300
of Reno,
wherever the fuck we are.

1930
01:34:17,580 --> 01:34:21,190
We're headed to the metropolis of Reno,
Nevada.

1931
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:25,120
Andrew dice clay was here the day before
we left,

1932
01:34:25,890 --> 01:34:28,000
but the show day we're leaving.
Yeah,

1933
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:29,853
I was,
uh,

1934
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:32,230
I was going to call them and say hi,
stop on it.

1935
01:34:32,231 --> 01:34:35,560
But we had to drive five hours to the
middle of nowhere.

1936
01:34:36,850 --> 01:34:41,620
Um,
so let's wrap this thing up was bring it

1937
01:34:41,621 --> 01:34:45,940
on back home.
But I think your life experiences and

1938
01:34:45,941 --> 01:34:47,890
what you're trying to do is very
knowable dude.

1939
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:52,420
And I think what you're trying to do and
what you have done is very exceptional.

1940
01:34:52,780 --> 01:34:56,110
And that's one of the reasons why I
wanted to do this with you because this

1941
01:34:56,111 --> 01:34:58,360
story is that you were telling me over
this past weekend,

1942
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:02,720
the all the other times we've hung out
together over the past few years since I

1943
01:35:02,721 --> 01:35:04,430
met you in 2012.

1944
01:35:04,430 --> 01:35:05,960
Is that a copy hit the brakes with the
cops,

1945
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:09,770
the fuzz baby instead of cop?
Nope.

1946
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:11,200
Nope.
It looks like,

1947
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:16,680
um,
those stories are there.

1948
01:35:16,730 --> 01:35:17,900
Powerful man.
And I think,

1949
01:35:17,901 --> 01:35:18,930
uh,
it's,

1950
01:35:19,060 --> 01:35:21,290
it's nice for people to know there's
people like you out there.

1951
01:35:21,890 --> 01:35:22,940
Thanks man.
I appreciate that.

1952
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:26,360
So anything else you'd like to say to
the world?

1953
01:35:26,510 --> 01:35:28,370
Cause it's not,
I used to say America than people in

1954
01:35:28,371 --> 01:35:30,380
Europe got mad at me.
I don't think so.

1955
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:31,620
No,
that's it.

1956
01:35:31,621 --> 01:35:33,650
And Dan dougherty has spoken.
You fucks.

1957
01:35:33,890 --> 01:35:38,650
So Dan is most likely going to start his
own podcast someday.

1958
01:35:38,660 --> 01:35:40,670
And I know people like,
God damn it,

1959
01:35:40,671 --> 01:35:42,500
Rogan,
you're always trying to get people to

1960
01:35:42,501 --> 01:35:45,020
start podcasts.
It's not even my idea.

1961
01:35:45,290 --> 01:35:48,620
You fucking assholes.
It's dead until these idea.

1962
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:51,650
He wants to do a podcast.
And I think if you did want it would be

1963
01:35:51,651 --> 01:35:53,270
awesome.
So hopefully,

1964
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:55,640
uh,
you will do that and I'll have you on

1965
01:35:55,641 --> 01:35:58,040
again when you're launching that and
we'll let everybody know about that.

1966
01:35:58,250 --> 01:35:59,120
Thanks man.
Appreciate it.

1967
01:35:59,190 --> 01:36:00,290
All right,
my brother,

1968
01:36:00,291 --> 01:36:03,860
thank you so much and thank you
everybody for listening and,

1969
01:36:03,861 --> 01:36:05,090
uh,
that's it.

1970
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:06,800
We're done.
See Ya.

1971
01:36:06,830 --> 01:36:07,663
Bye.
Bye.

1972
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:08,090
Wow.
