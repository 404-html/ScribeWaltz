1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:04,330
Freak bitches if you care about what you
do,

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,210
that's just part of the program.
Absolutely.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,280
And that's it.
There's a healthy part to that.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,830
And then like moving on from it is,
it's easier now than it used to be.

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,880
It would just,
it would live in me for a while,

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:16,980
like,
oh dude,

7
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:21,360
you forgot the words of that song.
And then it becomes a mental block to

8
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:23,130
get up there and you go,
oh shit.

9
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:23,870
Like,
uh,

10
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,290
you know,
like a kicker or something,

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,240
you know,
a guy going to kick a field goal.

12
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:27,601
It's like,
Oh,

13
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:29,010
I missed that one.
I can't believe I did.

14
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,930
Then the next one,
oh my God,

15
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,230
now it's a thing,
you know?

16
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,520
Oh,
so getting over those mental blocks.

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,760
Fighters lose a fight and then they come
back and then you see the discomfort.

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,240
You can see the confusion and the fear
and that's,

19
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:46,690
uh,
that's one of the side,

20
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,720
I think,
psychological issues or some of the

21
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:50,610
hardest issues that people ever
overcome.

22
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,660
And it's just literally like a pattern
of thought in your mind or if you just

23
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:57,690
decide that you're not as good as you
used to be,

24
00:00:57,691 --> 00:01:00,950
you can manifest that and they're like,
physically you can do all the same

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,000
things.
That is so crazy.

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,350
The power of thought.
The power of my mind is it's pretty

27
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:12,351
dangerous at times and being creative
and make up all kinds of crap.

28
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,260
You know,
like a large was doing that just to fuck

29
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:17,250
with me.
I know it.

30
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,350
And then you'd talk to them later.
It's like,

31
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,490
what are you talking about?

32
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,850
Yeah,
that's,

33
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:24,800
that's pretty.
It's,

34
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,450
it's,
it's a curse and a gift that creativity,

35
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,610
you know,
how hard was it for you to get.

36
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:34,611
So Uber
a fear was a big motivator in that for

37
00:01:35,931 --> 00:01:37,060
me,
you know,

38
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,480
losing my family was.
That was,

39
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,700
that was the thing that scared me so
much.

40
00:01:43,701 --> 00:01:47,240
That was the bottom.
I hit that my family is going to go away

41
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:50,330
because of my behaviors that I brought
home from the road.

42
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,450
I got kicked out of the house by my
wife.

43
00:01:53,451 --> 00:01:56,260
I was living on my own somewhere and I,
you know,

44
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,010
I did not want that and maybe as part of
my upbringing,

45
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,143
you know,
um,

46
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,850
my family Kinda desitin graded when I
was a kid,

47
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:07,220
you know,
father left my mother pass away,

48
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,510
I live with my brother and then Kinda
just all like the family,

49
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,830
you know,
where'd my stuff go,

50
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:15,890
where,
where it just kind of floated away and I

51
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:17,990
do not want that happening,
you know,

52
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,770
no matter what's going on,
we're going to talk this stuff out and

53
00:02:20,771 --> 00:02:21,980
make it work,
you know,

54
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,950
and my wife's have the same,
uh,

55
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,030
same idea,
same thought that,

56
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,480
you know,
her,

57
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,690
her family,
she was the invisible kid too,

58
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,030
you know,
so we relate a lot.

59
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,640
So there's no way we're going to let you
know,

60
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,530
any argument,
get in the way or just,

61
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,720
you know,
we're survivors,

62
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,840
we're survivors and we're gonna.
We're gonna talk through it no matter

63
00:02:41,841 --> 00:02:43,810
how much and you know,
she,

64
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,490
she did the right thing.
She kicked my ass,

65
00:02:46,491 --> 00:02:48,170
right the hell out of the house,
you know,

66
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,490
and um,
that scared the shit out of me.

67
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,140
So.
And she said,

68
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:56,270
hey,
you're not just going to the therapist

69
00:02:56,271 --> 00:03:00,340
now in nuts talking about this.
You got to go and sort this shit out.

70
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,470
So that's what I did.
So Rehab did Rehab really worked for me.

71
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,640
Helen,
Jeff,

72
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,990
to go for a while.
What worked for me was a

73
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,940
seven weeks someplace like basically
tearing you down to bones,

74
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,820
ripping your life apart.
Anything you thought about yourself or

75
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:27,610
what it was,
anything you thought you had,

76
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,380
your family,
your career,

77
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:32,920
your,
anything gone strip you down to just,

78
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,780
okay,
you're born.

79
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,750
Here's how you were when you were born.
You were okay,

80
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,190
you're a good,
good person.

81
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,870
Let's get back to that again.
And then they slowly rebuild you.

82
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,090
And then I went to a,
uh,

83
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,000
another they call them aftercare places.
I went there,

84
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,270
uh,
to a couple different ones and they fine

85
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:55,420
tune stuff and get integrated back into
life.

86
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:57,430
Because when you're in this cocoon and
your,

87
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,050
your frigging raw,
I mean,

88
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:02,470
I was raw meat when I came out.
And you can see it in that some kind of

89
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:05,050
monster movie.
I was pretty raw still.

90
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:09,010
I didn't know what I could or what I
should or shouldn't do,

91
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,870
you know.
Um,

92
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,620
so the,
the last place we went to was a place

93
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:18,730
that helps relationships,
so they got me and my wife together and

94
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:22,840
we'd see people separately and then come
together and talk about what we did and

95
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,650
communication frigging saved my life,
saved our family.

96
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,330
Um,
and working through that stuff.

97
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:36,331
So very grateful for my wife.
She's the one that didn't ask for this

98
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:41,410
shit.
She walked through fire with me and we

99
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:45,310
walked out together stronger,
way stronger than we ever would have

100
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:47,120
been before.
And you know,

101
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,010
my kids know my story,
my kids know my struggles and

102
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,050
they respect that.
They respect me and a different way.

103
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,670
I don't have to tell them what to do all
the time or just be like,

104
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:03,490
I'm this.
I can say sorry.

105
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,870
I can tell them,
hey,

106
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,680
here's what happened when I did that.
And you know,

107
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,910
I don't need to preach to them.
They got their own stuff,

108
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:12,460
but now they,
now they goof with me.

109
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:17,461
I ruined my trust with my family.
And now by some miracle they are goofing

110
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:20,434
with me.
It's like,

111
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,700
Dad,
shut up.

112
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,930
What do you get them like,
come on,

113
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,580
you know,
your overblowing this your way out of

114
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,150
dad,
you're taken up way too much space here.

115
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,920
Okay.
So they helped me and I realized that

116
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:36,280
there is help in a loving way.
How long have you been sober now?

117
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,230
15.
Fifteen years.

118
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,300
Did it start out when you,
when you first started doing it,

119
00:05:41,301 --> 00:05:44,220
did it feel like as you broke through
and you,

120
00:05:44,221 --> 00:05:44,871
you,
you know,

121
00:05:44,871 --> 00:05:47,660
you went to therapy and you got out of
Rehab and you,

122
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,750
you're going through this whole thing.
Was there a,

123
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,120
like a shaky leg period where you're
like,

124
00:05:53,121 --> 00:05:55,400
man,
do I know who I am anymore?

125
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,323
Oh,
absolutely.

126
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,500
That was,
it was.

127
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,110
That is the power of the mind and how,
you know,

128
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,710
here's how my life works.
And to actually just completely throw

129
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:09,140
that away and start over,
it's like,

130
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:09,800
well,
wait a minute,

131
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,910
who am I without this?
Um,

132
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,180
uh,
I can't talk to people.

133
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:15,350
I'm like,
I'm anxious,

134
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:18,350
I'm shy.
I'm all of the stuff that I thought

135
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,730
booze was helping me with or you know,
you know,

136
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,600
booze,
drugs,

137
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,450
women,
a shopping,

138
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,880
eating,
gambling,

139
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,970
you know,
there's so many things that can manifest

140
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:36,440
out there that it's,
it all goes back to one core thing.

141
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:38,900
It's like I don't,
I don't really know who I am.

142
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,860
So it took years and years and years to
figure out,

143
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,300
okay,
I like that.

144
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,550
That's part of me and this is part of
me.

145
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:47,384
The anger,
the,

146
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,420
the,
the,

147
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,910
you know,
the quirkiness,

148
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:53,180
the dark part of me,
all these little things that make me,

149
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,790
I got to hug him,
I to accept him,

150
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,370
you know,
and quit running from him and pretending

151
00:06:58,371 --> 00:07:01,820
like I am some immovable object on
stage.

152
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,760
That's tough and you know,
nothing can do,

153
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,230
you know,
nothing going to hurt me.

154
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,500
But inside,
yeah,

155
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,660
it's kind of a cliche saying that,
you know,

156
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:16,160
the harder that external shield,
the softer the inside and the more

157
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:19,010
vulnerable and,
and balancing that,

158
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,890
you know,
almost like you're concentrating so much

159
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:23,840
on the outside that you ignore the
inside.

160
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,950
Totally.
Totally.

161
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,010
And then forget what I really want.
And then you lose yourself in that

162
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,010
other,
that other person and yeah,

163
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:35,510
being in a band certainly accelerated
that,

164
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,370
you know,
there's,

165
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,060
there was drink and drug and all kinds
of stuff just thrown at you all the time

166
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:45,170
and it's starts off as a fun little
thing and then it turns into whiskey and

167
00:07:45,171 --> 00:07:47,510
escape and then all of a sudden you
don't really,

168
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,850
you don't remember why you're out there
doing stuff.

169
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,030
I went on tour just so I could go to the
Strip club,

170
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,511
you know,
hey,

171
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:54,860
we're going to this place,
you know,

172
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:56,390
and over going to drink here.

173
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,100
And you know,
knew all that stuff.

174
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,430
But the actual playing onstage,
it kind of got forgotten about a little

175
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:04,401
bit,
you know,

176
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,830
it was.
We get caught up in the rockstar stuff

177
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:09,140
and there's a,
there's a song on this album,

178
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,400
moth into flame that directly talks
about the how fame can be this crazy

179
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:20,120
drug.
And it can completely take you over if

180
00:08:20,121 --> 00:08:21,050
you let it,
you know,

181
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,720
you're searching for that thing that's
going to save you.

182
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:24,980
And it's,
it's you,

183
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:26,630
it's in your,
it's already there.

184
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,160
You just gotta you just gotTa find it
and accept it.
