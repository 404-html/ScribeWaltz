1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,820
Or live Neil Brennan in the middle of 
tweeting.

2
00:00:02,821 --> 00:00:07,690
What are you doing?
I'm using my Samsung Galaxy right now.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,400
Says a beautiful phone.
Hi.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,700
To me.
Your voice is so commercial.

5
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:16,701
Thanks very much.
You were on stage the other night and 

6
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:16,701
the belly room and we were in the green 
room.

7
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:17,400
We're like,
his voice is so commercial.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,940
Like it sounds like that God damn car.
So I'll never be able to separate them.

9
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,630
Now I know I shouldn't say that 
commercial.

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,640
Just say that series of commercials.
How many of those fucking things you'd 

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:28,640
done?
I,

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:28,640
you know what?
I don't know.

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,631
Probably 30.
I just do sessions and then they do 

14
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:33,870
whatever they want.
We should do other shit man.

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,570
If you were just doing that and then you
became the verizon guy,

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,430
you know.
Can you hear me now?

17
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,010
Like that guy.
That guy's fucked.

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:40,880
Fuck fucked.

19
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,740
You're getting a dell.
Oh that guy's fucked.

20
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,690
How about the girl?
The insurance girl.

21
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,670
It's always know.
Is that a name?

22
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:48,510
Yeah,
but they.

23
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,360
At least they keep making those.
She is fucked once she's done though,

24
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,340
but she's probably made a killing by 
this point.

25
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,960
Hopefully,
but is it worth it?

26
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:00,830
The first one,
but that guy from that fucking 

27
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,490
commercial that always gets in the 
accidents and falls down and gets hurt,

28
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,410
you know that a handsome gentleman,
he,

29
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:06,520
they cast him in a lot of shit.
He's in movies too.

30
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,460
He's always in movies.
He was in John Wick.

31
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,320
He's been.
John Wick was good,

32
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:11,040
right?
Fuck yeah.

33
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,420
What I've heard,
it's good.

34
00:01:12,421 --> 00:01:16,380
I just haven't watched it.
I mean it's no like brilliant,

35
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,970
like super creative,
undeniable work of art.

36
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,180
But it's funny shit as far as like a 
really wild,

37
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:26,470
crazy entertainment.
It's just,

38
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,360
it's like crazy action sequence.

39
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,400
The craziest is the guy who directed it 
was a fight coordinator apparently,

40
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,320
so he just had ideas for like the ideas 
he'd never given people I think.

41
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,850
Oh.
And so he was like,

42
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,260
eh.
So we just saved it.

43
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,440
He needs a sandbag.
He must have worked for and then and 

44
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:50,060
then unleashed.
It does not work with writers like 

45
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,091
you're a writer.
Doesn't that work with writers 

46
00:01:53,091 --> 00:01:53,091
sometimes,
like if you see like,

47
00:01:53,091 --> 00:01:53,460
like specific writers are writing for 
someone else,

48
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:57,360
like a monologue or something like that.
I know what you're getting at.

49
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,800
No,
I mean like,

50
00:01:58,801 --> 00:01:59,490
look,
I don't.

51
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:04,650
There are certain jokes that like if I'm
writing for like rock or something,

52
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,390
it's usually for like the bet awards,
so it's not like a.

53
00:02:09,391 --> 00:02:14,391
It would have done that in my.
I would have done that topical joke 

54
00:02:14,391 --> 00:02:16,941
about usher in my.
The thing about monologues,

55
00:02:17,181 --> 00:02:18,840
it's like pretty disposable,
but yeah,

56
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:22,980
I know I every now and then people on 
snl that sucked as writers and then they

57
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:25,500
became cast members and all of a sudden 
I hit a lot of good ideas.

58
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,730
They just store them all like squirrels.
Yeah.

59
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,830
Just like totally sandbag because comics
are like inherently kind of self 

60
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,620
obsessed,
you know,

61
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:39,621
and the idea of like writing selflessly 
for someone else and making them much 

62
00:02:39,691 --> 00:02:44,691
better.
I was talking to somebody about this 

63
00:02:44,691 --> 00:02:45,420
yesterday,
the fact that we,

64
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,780
it's an accepted thing in comedy that 
it's just the accepted caste system that

65
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:53,790
rock is basically saying like,
Hey,

66
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,960
I'm funnier than you and I'm hosting 
shelves.

67
00:02:55,961 --> 00:03:00,961
So fucking Gimme jokes it based on what 
the world saying.

68
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:02,680
I don't,
I don't think it's that explicit.

69
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,920
There is at the same time,
there's something flattering about the 

70
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:07,920
fact that like,
one of the best comics wants me to run,

71
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,650
but it's a great um,
but there's also something about like,

72
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,420
you come here,
rub my back,

73
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,380
hey other MMA fighter,
come rub my back,

74
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,370
this fight.
I'm ranked higher than you.

75
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,590
So come around.
My bug was just like,

76
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:22,680
okay,
you can pay and all that stuff.

77
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,820
Think of it that way at all.
I think of it as,

78
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:25,930
first of all,
honestly,

79
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:27,070
I don't either.
I know you don't.

80
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,370
It's very intelligent for him because 
it's the smart way to do it in a lot of 

81
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,490
people don't do it that way.
They don't bring in other people to help

82
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:35,980
them and they're,
they're working kind of suffer,

83
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:41,330
you know,
like he's pretty smart in that way that 

84
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,880
he's like looking at objects that 
there's other strong people around.

85
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:46,030
If I bring them in,
it'll make my already strong act.

86
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,270
Even do it for his act.
He'll do it for a TV show monologue.

87
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,200
And uh,
and so it's not.

88
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,710
And the other thing with rock is it's 
generally you write stuff for him.

89
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:59,260
And sent it to him so that he can be 
confident in his shit.

90
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,820
Be like,
okay,

91
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:03,860
my shit's better than this.
Like fun.

92
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,950
Well you just need like a giant mound of
shit to chop away at.

93
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,490
And then you find where the gems are.
If you only have like a few,

94
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,040
like pretty decent ideas and you're 
trying to build them up,

95
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:20,041
that's way,
way less effective than an enormous 

96
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:20,710
catalog of ideas need to turn to present
x ones.

97
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,550
Yeah.
That's a rock.

98
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:22,470
Always says,
uh,

99
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,250
he's like,
I like,

100
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,580
I,
I have comedy writers around the way 

101
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,400
rappers have gold chains.
Like that's all he spent his money on.

102
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,630
You know what I mean?
Like if he's gonna,

103
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,130
he's not gonna,
he's not gonna buy a chain.

104
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:38,131
He's like,
I'll just have a writer write for 

105
00:04:38,131 --> 00:04:38,440
fucking a movie with Marisa.
That's smart.

106
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,450
Yeah.
Well that's why he's Chris Rock.

107
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,740
He's got a,
you know,

108
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:46,741
as effective strategy for optimizing all
of his shows and all of the sets and 

109
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:47,390
all,
you know,

110
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,400
he's,
he knows the fee on the thing that I 

111
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:52,400
was.

112
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:52,570
When you were saying about having other 
people come in.

113
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,990
Look,
I find that a lot of guys,

114
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,620
comedian wise,
when you get to the theater level,

115
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:05,450
um,
it's basically all your audiences are 

116
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,840
henpecked.
All of your audiences are predisposed to

117
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,760
like you.
Do you ever scan?

118
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,640
What I found is a lot of people when 
they go to theaters,

119
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,250
they're acting,
they're plateaus or gets worse.

120
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:21,270
Do you find,
do you ever specifically go to rooms 

121
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,500
where they don't know you're coming to 
get a better read on shit?

122
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,430
Yeah.
Well,

123
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:29,431
I do a lot of sets during the day,
like regular sets at the Improv or the 

124
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:32,260
store where they're there to see,
have a wide variety of people.

125
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:34,120
I do a lot of those.
I think those are important,

126
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:39,390
I think sets at the store important 
period because it's a fucking jaded 

127
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,480
group down there.
It's beautiful and magical,

128
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:41,700
but it's jaded.
Yeah.

129
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,410
It's the hardest thing in the world.
Belly Room.

130
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,700
Yeah.
You might as well be doing standup for 

131
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:49,700
one person.
One hundred percent.

132
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,130
People are right in front of the.
The worst part of the belly room is 

133
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,070
there's people to the right that could 
just charge the stage right there.

134
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,200
Fucking it.

135
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,780
Yeah.
Well it's also,

136
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:02,780
they have.
It's great though,

137
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,390
like what we're all were saying about 
the thing,

138
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:10,391
like the worst part of it,
but even the worst part about it is 

139
00:06:10,391 --> 00:06:11,210
magic because that room is fucking 
magic,

140
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:12,500
man.
That belly room,

141
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:14,750
if you get something to work and that 
belly room.

142
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:20,350
We were talking about this last night,
that there's the belly room and the Ice 

143
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,280
House and the Ice House is maybe the 
best club ever.

144
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,160
It's got the rep and having done it,
it's like the easiest,

145
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,070
easiest.
Yeah.

146
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,890
Yeah.
Well let's just set up.

147
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:28,690
Perfect.
Yeah.

148
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,610
The ceiling is low.
Everyone's stuffed in there.

149
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:33,350
It's very contagious.
Laughter is great.

150
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:38,351
Acoustics saw wood everywhere.
The laughter really reverberates and 

151
00:06:38,351 --> 00:06:42,881
it's got whatever the fuck.
Fifty years of comedy burned into the 

152
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:45,380
walls.
It's the oldest club in the country.

153
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,870
I think it's older than 50 years old,
isn't it?

154
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:48,790
I think that.
I think it's.

155
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:53,810
I think it is.
I think it's like 55 years old or 

156
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:53,810
something like that,
but it's the irl.

157
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,160
It's essentially the oldest comedy club 
on Earth because the oldest clubs for 

158
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,560
comedy,
we're in America,

159
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,720
so the oldest one in America,
so it's the oldest,

160
00:06:59,721 --> 00:07:03,290
longest running club ever,
so it's super rare place,

161
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:08,120
but it's way easier than like the Olr or
especially the belly room.

162
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,070
Different kind of Louis say in

163
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,830
an interview,
like when he does,

164
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,690
when he's in La,
he'll go,

165
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,990
he'll do like an alternative show.
Then he'll do the Improv or the laugh 

166
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:23,800
factory and then he'll do the store and 
it's like if it works,

167
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,340
he's like,
everything will work on alternative 

168
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,021
room.
Some stuff will work at the Improv and 

169
00:07:31,021 --> 00:07:33,180
one thing will work at the store and the
one thing that works with the store that

170
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,170
keeps.
That's smart.

171
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,810
Yeah.

172
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:41,730
So you need all of those.
Because when I was just doing the store 

173
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,130
only,
I think my ax suffered a little bit.

174
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,930
I think where does it go?
Because that's the thing.

175
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:44,760
It's hard to

176
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,180
the psychographic of the story.
You think they [inaudible] I still 

177
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,180
couldn't tell you.
Having been working there six,

178
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:56,181
seven years,
I still couldn't tell you like the 

179
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:57,921
psychology of that kind of part of the.
Of the average of the audience's 

180
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,360
collective unconscious.

181
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,760
Well,
first of all,

182
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:03,740
let me just say this.
It's way better now.

183
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,390
The second,
my second run of the store from 2007 on.

184
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,740
I wasn't there,
so I started up again December 14.

185
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,020
It's way better.
It's just better.

186
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,660
It's a better club.
The young guys coming up are better.

187
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:19,730
There's a better vibe.
The audiences are better.

188
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,260
Yeah.
When I was there in the,

189
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,640
in the early two thousands,
man,

190
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:24,980
I was a war zone.
It was all old.

191
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,120
It was all old timers,
right?

192
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:28,130
I mean it was a lot of world,
but it was also.

193
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:33,131
The audience was just like monsters.
There was a lot of months like rapey dm 

194
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,280
hat,
goalie,

195
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,620
drunky.
No crowd control at all.

196
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:41,621
They have real crowd control now.
They'll kick people out if they're 

197
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:41,621
retarded.
Yeah.

198
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:42,020
They didn't use to do that.
They'll kick people out.

199
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,990
If they say eight things you have to 
say.

200
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,090
You have to say,
fuck it.

201
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,840
Ate any of these gloves like,
no,

202
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:49,760
we're good.
It's fucking get them out.

203
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,250
They're not going to.
If they say more than one thing,

204
00:08:52,251 --> 00:08:53,960
get them out.
They kicked the guy out at the ice house

205
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:57,600
last night and he like early on this one
bit,

206
00:08:57,601 --> 00:09:02,601
he would cap yelling the same thing out 
while the bit was going on and I 

207
00:09:02,601 --> 00:09:02,601
figured,
let me know Oregon.

208
00:09:02,601 --> 00:09:06,480
Yeah,
we got to the end of the bay and he's 

209
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:06,480
still yelling out the thing.
I'm like,

210
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:06,480
I heard you.
You Fuck?

211
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:06,650
And he's like,
well no,

212
00:09:06,651 --> 00:09:11,651
I was talking about the thing on your 
part because we're not having a 

213
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:11,651
conversation is a fucking show.
Did he?

214
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:11,730
Keeps going.
I'm like,

215
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,760
Oh fucking Christ.
And then when the bouncers come over to 

216
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:16,760
take him away,
he goes,

217
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,660
are you serious?
I was helping.

218
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,250
What do you think?
They just picked you.

219
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,710
They just randomly picked.
The guy decided to fuck with them.

220
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,510
That's what I said the other day to a 
woman who was yelling.

221
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:27,430
I go,
you go to fucking Katy Perry concert,

222
00:09:27,431 --> 00:09:30,120
sit at the bar at the bottom of the 
stage and just sing along with her.

223
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,090
Shut the fuck up.
Like I don't need your help.

224
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,120
They didn't book the show and go those 
four guys and then hopefully someone 

225
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,120
will come and heckle them.
Yeah,

226
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,951
but a Katy Perry concert,
if you go and sit there and sing along 

227
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:42,951
with her,
it's probably flatter area.

228
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:44,190
Yeah,
but if you're trying to,

229
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,830
if you're,
if you're at the foot of the stage doing

230
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:51,831
it,
it's probably the worst would be if you 

231
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:51,831
were saying don't sing that song 
precise.

232
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:56,040
Don't you have another song?
Which mayor was telling me the name drop

233
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:01,370
a was saying that the biggest issue at 
his shows now girls running to the foot 

234
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:08,001
of the stage,
turning their back to them and taking a 

235
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:08,001
selfie.
Oh no,

236
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:10,170
he's at.
If he has security to like stop it.

237
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,980
It's like if I didn't stop it,
there'd be hundreds of people every year

238
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:20,080
and it's hugely distracting because 
there's a thing starting at the thing 

239
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,080
you're looking at.

240
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,080
Yeah.
Well,

241
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,111
don't you find distracting when you look
out into the crowd and you see like 10 

242
00:10:24,111 --> 00:10:27,651
phones up,
take the photos of you or taking a 

243
00:10:27,651 --> 00:10:28,470
selfie or taking picture with Neil 
Brune.

244
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,500
She'll kill it at Hashtag.
Hashtag winning.

245
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:38,721
Hashtag tiger blood.
I mean there's so many people want to 

246
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,640
take pictures now that Hannibal burress 
did some weird thing at one of his shows

247
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:46,530
where they have some new technology.
It's like a pouch and they give you this

248
00:10:46,531 --> 00:10:47,640
pouch,
close it.

249
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:52,641
And when you're inside the club the 
pouch doesn't open so you can't get to 

250
00:10:52,641 --> 00:10:53,970
your phone.
So if your phone rings,

251
00:10:53,971 --> 00:10:57,330
if you feel like you must answer it,
you have to leave the venue and then the

252
00:10:57,331 --> 00:11:02,331
patch will open.
I guess it works on some sort of like a 

253
00:11:02,331 --> 00:11:04,970
frequency if you're past like one of 
those electronic dog collars,

254
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,700
you know those things.

255
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,980
So it's something like that.
But man,

256
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:10,200
the reaction to it was like,
fuck you.

257
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,490
I was reading all the reaction,
although I tweeted it.

258
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,120
Yeah.
You know,

259
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:16,350
because I saw the store.
I'm like,

260
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,220
hmm,
this is kind of interesting.

261
00:11:17,221 --> 00:11:19,890
I wonder how people feel about this.
Not that I would implement it,

262
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,740
I just,
I feel like the streisand effect is in 

263
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:25,740
effect the streisand effect.
You know,

264
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,870
the,
the Barbara Streisand,

265
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,910
they found her house and they put her 
house online like they,

266
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,840
you know,
like someone took a photo of it and like

267
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,260
this is where Barbara streisand's 
houses.

268
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,060
And so she,
you know,

269
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,670
was offended.
She made this big deal and she's like,

270
00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:40,890
fuck you take my house down,
this and that.

271
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,280
And because she put so much effort into 
fighting the fact that our house was 

272
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,391
down way more people knew about her 
house and they all attacked and went 

273
00:11:50,391 --> 00:11:54,161
after her.
I think if you tell people she can't 

274
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:54,161
bring your cell phone to my show,

275
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:55,730
then they start wearing.
Yeah,

276
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,670
they put a Gopro on,
are they,

277
00:11:57,671 --> 00:11:58,160
you know,
they,

278
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:03,170
they'll film from a fucking one of those
glasses that has the lens in the sense 

279
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,560
you had that at the tail down.
I had a guy google glasses,

280
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,870
uh,
google the laugh factory.

281
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:08,620
And I go,
dude,

282
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,510
I can't fucking.
Yeah.

283
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:15,250
I don't know if you're taping right?
So you're just being a dick because I,

284
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:15,990
you know,
I'm,

285
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:21,060
it's all I can think about now is this 
fucking dude with the visor in my 

286
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,381
peripheral vision and he might be,
he could be fucking periscoping it now 

287
00:12:25,381 --> 00:12:28,180
can use periscope from Google.
I think Google last might even be dead.

288
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,910
Do periscope the show.
I do periscope things,

289
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:32,020
but no,
not to show.

290
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:37,110
How come you want to.
Where I want to tweet about this by the 

291
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,110
way.
Where should people go?

292
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,220
The show?
I already tweeted it out.

293
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:43,260
Just go to mine and retweet.
If you need to write you a bit addicted 

294
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:43,260
to the.
No,

295
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,010
hold on.
Let me put that fucker and get it over 

296
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:47,300
with Joseph Justa.
No,

297
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:47,700
no,
no,

298
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:48,000
no,
no,

299
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:48,260
no,
no,

300
00:12:48,261 --> 00:12:49,740
no.
I got it.

301
00:12:49,741 --> 00:12:52,930
I got you are.
You are a commercial actor.

302
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:55,850
I know for a cell phone company and 
you're addicted to cell phones.

303
00:12:55,851 --> 00:13:00,040
Snake is interesting.
Eating the tail on around.

304
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,750
You need.
Alright,

305
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,080
great.
Why aren't you periscoping?

306
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,440
Alright,
I'll put you.

307
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,820
Pushed it away.
I love it.

308
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,080
I love it.
It's out of range.

309
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,340
He's a haunting you right now.
That's out of range now.

310
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,990
Sometimes it haunts me.
I put my phone over there,

311
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:24,060
but,
but if there's something important 

312
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,090
happening right now in the world of Van 
to four wheel drive,

313
00:13:25,091 --> 00:13:27,700
conversions are the,
uh,

314
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,790
the cell phone thing.
Someone was telling me when you go again

315
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,470
and I don't.
This isn't my name.

316
00:13:32,471 --> 00:13:37,471
Drop when you go to drake's house.
When girls come over [inaudible] he 

317
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:37,840
makes everyone turned their cell phones.
It really?

318
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:38,800
Yeah.
Smart.

319
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,920
Yeah.
Because they kind of want to take a 

320
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:43,920
picture of course.
Um,

321
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:43,920
yeah.
And it's just like,

322
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,320
no,
you can't do it.

323
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,180
So he makes him like put it in a bucket 
or something.

324
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:46,630
I don't.
Yeah.

325
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,600
I don't know the specifics of it,
but it's good move.

326
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,670
Yeah.
Shovel Vault smart.

327
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,460
Safe.
Put your phone.

328
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,880
That is what is.
Why is the table in the vault?

329
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:56,290
That's where your phone goes.
What?

330
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,750
Everybody puts her phone and want to say
you want to say yes.

331
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,310
No,
no phones.

332
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,930
No phones baby.
Um,

333
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,550
yeah.
How are we going to take selfie?

334
00:14:06,551 --> 00:14:07,420
Drake,
drake.

335
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,630
I got it baby.
I got it.

336
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,510
Well,
you have to have,

337
00:14:10,511 --> 00:14:15,511
if you're like one of those big time 
baller rapper characters and trying to 

338
00:14:15,511 --> 00:14:19,691
keep everything on the dl or at least 
keep as much of your private life 

339
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:24,780
private as possible.
You've got to take like some serious 

340
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:24,920
precautionary steps.
Yeah,

341
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,310
I've heard of guys like having prenups 
are not prenups,

342
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:29,350
but nondisclosure.
Nondisclosure.

343
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,530
Oh yeah.
Every.

344
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,820
I mean not everybody,
but like that's a common thing.

345
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:38,850
Like I've done things where like you 
can't even be in the bedroom with the 

346
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,970
person until you've signed an NDA.
Wow.

347
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,820
Yeah.
Well if you're worried about a fake rape

348
00:14:45,821 --> 00:14:48,160
accusation,
that's the way to deal with it.

349
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,290
One hundred percent.
But then the girl could say,

350
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:51,920
well,
I was

351
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,710
thinking we're going to make out and as 
soon as I signed it,

352
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:55,990
he just started raping.
Yeah.

353
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,530
Yeah.
And then it's like,

354
00:14:57,531 --> 00:14:58,520
well,
yeah,

355
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:03,670
but you said you wouldn't say,
well look here today I'm going to tough 

356
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,060
spot.
Because you said,

357
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,140
yeah,
you just,

358
00:15:06,141 --> 00:15:09,380
I think they assume like once I sign 
this,

359
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,300
you're not,
like all bets are off,

360
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:14,270
but I think they just assume.
I don't know man.

361
00:15:14,271 --> 00:15:15,070
I would think that,
yeah,

362
00:15:15,071 --> 00:15:17,690
I guess if you're Michael Jordan though.
Yeah.

363
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,100
What do you do?
You know what I mean?

364
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:21,320
Like what do you.
You have to.

365
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,590
Well those guys,
when you're worth as much money as a guy

366
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,680
like Michael Jordan,
you become not just a human being,

367
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:29,050
but an opportunity.
Yeah.

368
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,520
Like a multinational corporation.
Yeah.

369
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,720
Walking around and appealing the slip 
and fall accidents and charge you with 

370
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:38,810
it.
Oh,

371
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:39,830
absolutely.
Completely.

372
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,360
One hundred percent.
Right.

373
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:43,920
You've got to think that that is a.

374
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,240
he's a target in that sense.
Whereas if you're worth that kind of 

375
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:49,240
money,
people look at you and they go,

376
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,221
look,
if I sue this motherfucker for 

377
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:54,221
$100,000,000,
if things go badly,

378
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:54,221
I got five.
Yeah.

379
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:56,780
I mean like you only give me half a 
million dollars just to shut the fuck up

380
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,980
and then boom,
you're out the door with a half a 

381
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,881
million bucks and you know,
nothing really even happened to you and 

382
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:04,250
there's a bunch of people that do that 
over and over and over,

383
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,050
over and over.
Jordan probably get sued everyday.

384
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,670
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah.

385
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,870
Between the corporation and the,
just every like there's.

386
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,910
Yeah.
Wow.

387
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,310
Not fucked.
Yeah.

388
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,500
I was reading about this one guy who was
involved.

389
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:20,900
I forget what the case,
but um,

390
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:26,320
it turned out that he had sued like 
dozens and dozens of people for like 

391
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,090
he's a professional lawsuit litigate or,
or a lawsuit claiming.

392
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,740
Yeah,
whatever the fuck it is.

393
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,800
Some shit and this guy just does that.
It goes from one to the next tries to 

394
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,290
figure out how to make some money and 
then susie this guy and then Suzanne guy

395
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,700
for fraud and this guy for front,
like,

396
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,860
you know,
that's a creepy,

397
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,100
creepy abuse.
There's a music company like that that 

398
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,071
just will go after the slightest 
infraction real.

399
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:54,960
And they,
they,

400
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,910
they're,
they're like,

401
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,750
they're known in the music industry.
They will sue you.

402
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,980
It's like commodore music or some shit 
and they'll just go after fucking the 

403
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,520
slightest.
It kind of sounds like this,

404
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,430
that in and it holds people up and 
people to settle.

405
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,160
Well every now and then when one does 
get through,

406
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:15,140
like that song that was like blurred 
lines.

407
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:16,320
Yeah.
Well Marvin Gaye.

408
00:17:16,321 --> 00:17:18,830
Yeah,
I mean that is exactly like,

409
00:17:18,831 --> 00:17:21,740
how the fuck did they not know that 
people are going to see that?

410
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:27,310
I think there's so much copying and the 
music business that I think they were 

411
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:30,290
just like,
it's just kind of like somewhat sounds,

412
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,780
just like fucking that song,
you know,

413
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:33,830
what I was listening to,
there was a,

414
00:17:33,831 --> 00:17:35,400
I was listening to a podcast,
the camera,

415
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:40,401
what it was they would,
but they were playing Bob Dylan songs 

416
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:43,511
that were stolen that,
that deal install wives because he was 

417
00:17:43,511 --> 00:17:47,000
doing all folk songs so it was all sort 
of public domain,

418
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,600
but he was taking other people's 
melodies and then making them,

419
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,740
changing the lyrics and those became 
hits for him.

420
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,190
Yeah,
it was,

421
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,600
I was,
blew my mind because you've got bob bill

422
00:17:57,601 --> 00:17:58,420
involve people.
It's like the,

423
00:17:58,421 --> 00:18:03,421
you know,
the poet laureate of the fucking the 

424
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:03,421
most,
etc.

425
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:03,570
Yeah.
Just as much as anYbody else.

426
00:18:03,571 --> 00:18:06,920
Yeah.
George harrison got sued for um,

427
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,680
two different songs was my avatar was 
not one of them.

428
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,380
Uh,
if they were both hits,

429
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,960
one was like,
I'd like to teach the world to sing.

430
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:20,961
I think he did it one that I think coke 
did it before him and then he did 

431
00:18:21,271 --> 00:18:24,030
something that sounded like and lost 
that I believe I could be wrong,

432
00:18:24,031 --> 00:18:26,250
but I like to buy the world a coke.
Yeah.

433
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,830
That was before.
I'd like to teach the world to say no.

434
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:29,950
I,
uh,

435
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,680
no.
It's the same song.

436
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,010
Oh,
I don't know what george harrison's was,

437
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:40,070
but I know that he lost two lawsuits,
but to thin lines one after all the 

438
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:44,901
different lawsuits and all the different
people that have been sued for stealing 

439
00:18:44,901 --> 00:18:47,280
lines in,
in songs or stealing melodies,

440
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,650
you would think that they wouldn't think
that they could pull that off.

441
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,710
Yeah.
I was surprised that one,

442
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:54,050
to be honest with you,
because.

443
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,570
Yeah,
I was surprised that one because it's.

444
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,450
You could make a case.
It's different enough.

445
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,890
Really.
Okay.

446
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:02,580
It's not the same.
It's not the same tempo.

447
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,330
Oh,
okay.

448
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,850
Maybe I was wrong.
Maybe I'm wrong.

449
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,400
Need listen to it.
I know they did another one.

450
00:19:08,401 --> 00:19:11,730
They tried to go after him for another 
marvin gaye song.

451
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,130
Oh yeah,
yeah,

452
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,170
yeah.
Yeah.

453
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,040
That one's like much more shaky than 
this one,

454
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,820
but for ells,
a creative guy,

455
00:19:18,821 --> 00:19:22,500
so it's not like they're dealing with 
some hack and he wrote the whole thing.

456
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,240
Is it possible to frozen a little bit of
a hack a look?

457
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:30,260
Anything's possible.
Anything is anything.

458
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:30,970
I mean,
yeah,

459
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,010
I mean,
yeah,

460
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:37,011
he's a.
I'm sure everyone's a little bit of a 

461
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:37,011
hack I guess,
but like bob dylan's,

462
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:37,011
a little bit of a hack.
Precisely.

463
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,090
None of us are safe.
None of us are safe.

464
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:44,130
If bill cosby's raping,
what chance did the rest of us have?

465
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,010
Does that the biggest shock that you've 
ever heard in all my years of.

466
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:48,480
No.
You know why?

467
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:53,810
Because I met him 20 years ago and he 
was a fucking dick and when his show 

468
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:57,030
started the sitcom,
I was like,

469
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,270
I don't like that guy.
Really.

470
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,970
I promise you.
As a 10 year old,

471
00:19:59,971 --> 00:20:00,960
I was like,
I don't like that guy.

472
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,870
It's Just a fucking ego maniac.
I knew it from the mit.

473
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,000
I mean,
I'm rarely that write about something.

474
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:09,630
Rarely do I not like someone and they 
turn out to be like a serial rapist,

475
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:14,070
but usually you're just kind of a dick,
but to become a c,

476
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:14,580
I was like,
yeah,

477
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:16,680
that totally makes sense for you.
Ever made it,

478
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:18,180
met him.
You had this,

479
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,260
you had,
you'd made them?

480
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,040
Yeah.
Figured it out.

481
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,550
Didn't like,
didn't never liked the sitcom.

482
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,300
Thought i was crazy.
Really?

483
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,670
Yeah.
When I went to college,

484
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
nyu,
there was an essay in some english lit 

485
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,971
book,
say explaining what the formula for the 

486
00:20:34,971 --> 00:20:36,920
show was,
which was um,

487
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,540
the kids have an original idea,
a,

488
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:46,660
an original design and original idea.
And then bill cosby spends the episode 

489
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,820
chopping them down and it was like,
yeah,

490
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,600
that's exactly what every episode was.
And I hated it just as a kid.

491
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:53,410
I'm like,
fuck this guY,

492
00:20:55,090 --> 00:21:00,090
fuck them.
Let them have a bug and lead to let a 

493
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,820
ruby or whatever the rudy,
have a fucking let her get a pet or 

494
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:05,200
whatever.
Whatever she wanted.

495
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,050
So you met him?
Yeah.

496
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,050
And how lonG after you saw the show did 
you meet him?

497
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:15,090
I met him in 1993 at,
uh,

498
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,380
the arsenio hall show,
the original.

499
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,370
Really?
YeaH.

500
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,830
and so this would,
do we know each other then?

501
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,240
Yeah,
it was after.

502
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,240
I mean,
we hadn't seen it but it was like after 

503
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,251
I was a doorman down here and went to 
and met the woman who works at the 

504
00:21:29,691 --> 00:21:34,050
arcenio and through dave and whatever.
So she was like,

505
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,220
and whenever there's somebody cool 
launch,

506
00:21:35,221 --> 00:21:40,221
it's like come and meet someone.
So met him and he was talking about 

507
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,620
slavery and he was like,
it was me,

508
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,370
him and two black dudes and he goes,
he,

509
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:52,430
he because he goes.
And then the dutch man came and pointed 

510
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:52,720
at me and I was like,
I'm not dutch,

511
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,920
but he was like,
you know,

512
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,620
close enough.
But the fact that he would point them in

513
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,820
because we're not,
you know,

514
00:21:57,821 --> 00:21:58,930
I'm not,
what are the odds?

515
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:03,931
I'm fucking dutch.
And the fact that he just pointed at me 

516
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:07,270
and was any.
He's a predator like wildly smug guy.

517
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,250
Wildly smug.
Yeah.

518
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,330
Huh.

519
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,910
I'm like,
you know,

520
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,380
smart guy.
But not as.

521
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,500
He's one of those guys will talk and 
then say in other words,

522
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,940
four times.
It's like,

523
00:22:18,941 --> 00:22:20,380
no,
you're making the same point for them.

524
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,220
Like I got it the first time.
Right.

525
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,100
To impress themselves.
Yeah.

526
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,050
In my experience.
Yeah.

527
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,190
Yeah.
Smart.

528
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,790
Like really smart people at god damn it.
w w,

529
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:33,910
what are we doing here with wrestling?
And we having a conversation like,

530
00:22:33,911 --> 00:22:35,020
what are we doing?
Well they're not,

531
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,830
you're not there.
Yeah,

532
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:42,390
you don't.
It doesn't matter who they're talking 

533
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:42,390
to.
You're just a warm.

534
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:42,390
You're just like,
uh,

535
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,600
if they're the predator,
you're just like fucking red.

536
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,200
Like you're just a thing that they're 
talking at.

537
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:50,260
Yeah.
And the heat signature.

538
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:50,990
Yeah.
You're,

539
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,830
you're a walking heats so they just 
fucking die.

540
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,840
I.
Well that to me was the only thing that 

541
00:22:59,840 --> 00:22:59,840
made sense about this.

542
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,350
It's like how could someone drugs,
somebody like that.

543
00:23:02,351 --> 00:23:07,351
And I've thought about and I was like,
I bet if you have lived decade after 

544
00:23:07,351 --> 00:23:11,611
decade of people just kissing her ass 
and everyone around you is like some 

545
00:23:11,611 --> 00:23:16,051
weird form of a yes man.
Like you have a whole industry behind 

546
00:23:16,051 --> 00:23:16,051
you.
Like,

547
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:21,210
but he's on the show,
like think about he has all the 

548
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:24,061
production assistants and the producers 
and the executive producers and the 

549
00:23:24,061 --> 00:23:25,550
cameraman and the sound guys and the 
makeup people and everyone is just,

550
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:31,220
yeah,
mr cosby and that's your existence and 

551
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,810
you get onstage in front of that crowd 
and you're making this show and he's 

552
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:36,990
american killer comedian.
He's a fUcking killer.

553
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,780
I don't like the guy.
And I'm saying he's,

554
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:43,890
he's a killer.
And think that you just developed this 

555
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,250
sort of like really distorted,
psychotic view

556
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,950
of yourself in relationship to the rest 
of the world?

557
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,190
I don't think so because he's the first 
famous person that's,

558
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,390
I think he had the pathology before.
He was famous.

559
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,990
the idea that I've never heard of a 
famous person like,

560
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,200
oh yeah,
so my shit now is I got to the drug 

561
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,870
bitches in and rape them when they're 
asleep level.

562
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,470
Like that's not a level that's not like 
a known itself.

563
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:13,290
So I think it was the thing that he had 
a.

564
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:18,580
In some ways I don't feel bad for them,
but what do you do you know,

565
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,740
any sexual desire you have,
you're eventually going to do.

566
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,540
You can quell it for four nights.
So you say like if you have that,

567
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,160
what do you do?
Kind of creepy.

568
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:35,690
Like there was a this american life 
about a guy who was a pedophile.

569
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,000
He was 19,
he was a pedophile.

570
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,300
One of the had sexual feelings for like 
10,

571
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:43,520
12 year old boys hadn't acted on It and 
it's like,

572
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,770
what do I do?
Jesus christ.

573
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,130
What do you do?
That's why when people go so and so like

574
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,480
prostitutes,
whatever.

575
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:52,550
It's like a transvestite,
whatever.

576
00:24:52,551 --> 00:24:56,660
It's like poor him.
Like in some ways it's like you're gonna

577
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:00,710
your dick makes you do awful shit.
So I believe he had that before.

578
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,100
Before he was famous or anything I was.
I don't think it's.

579
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,320
Yeah,
I wonder if that part is

580
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:11,620
that this was a more commonly accepted 
practice because he had a bit that he 

581
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:11,670
used to do about.

582
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:13,950
Yeah.

583
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:18,960
I wonder if like people didn't think 
that it was that big of a deal or as big

584
00:25:18,961 --> 00:25:23,961
of a deal as they think of now,
like maybe people didn't think of 

585
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:25,030
hitting someone with a mickey that's 
called.

586
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:28,870
They had a cute lIttle name for it.
Whereas now it's like drug raids.

587
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,930
Yeah.
You know?

588
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,930
Yeah.
To me that spanish fly argument was a.

589
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,830
That just sounded like one of those,
remember back in the day,

590
00:25:36,831 --> 00:25:41,831
but it's like remember speaking spell.
It's like one of those bits for 

591
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:41,831
regeneration.
Um,

592
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,330
but yeah,
I think it was way more like there was,

593
00:25:44,331 --> 00:25:49,331
I was reading about the,
one of the girls who lived at hugh 

594
00:25:49,331 --> 00:25:51,641
hefner's house and he offered her a loot
and saId back in the old days they used 

595
00:25:51,641 --> 00:25:54,380
to call these lego openers or thigh 
openers.

596
00:25:54,381 --> 00:25:56,250
And it's just like,
I believe it.

597
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,080
I believe that they use vitamins.
Yeah.

598
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,350
It's like,
yeah,

599
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:04,250
women even 30 years ago didn't have a 
lot of rights,

600
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,880
like sexual harassment.
I don't think the first sexual 

601
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,850
harassment suit was tilt if I'm at the 
earliest.

602
00:26:10,851 --> 00:26:11,870
It was the late seventies.

603
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,980
It's amazing how much things have 
changed.

604
00:26:14,981 --> 00:26:18,820
And how quickly things have changed,
we were reading yesterday on the podcast

605
00:26:18,821 --> 00:26:20,140
was yesterday,
day before yesterday,

606
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:24,490
this speech by lincoln when he was 
debating like 18,

607
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,970
58 to be debating the rights of black 
people.

608
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:33,160
And even lincoln back then was saying 
that he didn't think that they should be

609
00:26:33,161 --> 00:26:37,690
allowed to serve on juries or vote or 
even intermarry with whites.

610
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,000
And it was like,
whoa,

611
00:26:39,001 --> 00:26:40,750
like that's not that long ago.

612
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,970
I thought that there were four fifths of
a person.

613
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,070
Like you're

614
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,910
not,
you're not,

615
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,840
you're not three fifths,
but you're not fun either.

616
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,440
And you know,
the argument is,

617
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:52,560
well listen,
you have to put it into context like his

618
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:55,280
time during his time,
this was revolutionary.

619
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,630
That was progressive,
who's incredibly progressive.

620
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,370
Yeah.
It's not that long ago,

621
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:01,120
man,
so long ago at all.

622
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:06,410
That's done even 200 years ago.
What's cool is that peer that we're 

623
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:09,471
living in now as you can get rights.
I mean this shit is like the gay rights 

624
00:27:09,481 --> 00:27:10,430
movement and the trans,
right?

625
00:27:10,431 --> 00:27:12,300
I mean that.
I've never seen a movement like this.

626
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:17,550
Them get traction writes things amazing.
Yeah.

627
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,860
They're starting to get gay marriage all
over the country.

628
00:27:19,861 --> 00:27:21,290
It's like popping up pop,
pop,

629
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:21,970
pop.
It's,

630
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,760
it's a cause.
It was stupid anyway,

631
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:25,920
but first of all,
let's be honest.

632
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,120
Marriage is pretty fucking stupid.
Retarded.

633
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,400
This is coming from a married person.

634
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:34,430
Yeah.
The idea of like you're going to sign a 

635
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:34,430
contract.
Some of based on romance.

636
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:34,430
Yeah.
like,

637
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,460
you know,
I get it,

638
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,770
I get that you'd want,
you'd want some sort of security,

639
00:27:37,771 --> 00:27:39,810
but if you're gay and you can't even 
make.

640
00:27:39,811 --> 00:27:44,640
People can't even get pregnant unless 
you guys figure out how to eat.

641
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,820
You have to get a surrogate or you're 
talkIng about,

642
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:53,270
you know,
maybe friends that are also lesbians 

643
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:56,091
that want a kid.
And like I'll tell you will have two 

644
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,891
kIds.
You give me one and ultimately with the 

645
00:27:57,891 --> 00:27:58,470
how do you work it out,
but they're going to be your kids.

646
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,480
But yeah.
But that wasn't about that.

647
00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:02,610
It was about like you also couldn't 
visit.

648
00:28:02,611 --> 00:28:06,230
You're over the hump so you couldn't,
you couldn't get insurance rights,

649
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,050
all that stuff.
No.

650
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:10,710
Look,
even if you don't want to get married,

651
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,510
it's a,
it's a quality.

652
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:17,540
You know you want to be able to do,
you don't want to fucking law that says 

653
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,340
you can't imagine.
Can't marry another man that he loves.

654
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,720
That's gross and stupid and the fact 
that that was common until really 

655
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:27,570
recently and the argument,
because it aIn't writing well,

656
00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:29,700
that's not a fucking art.
It ain't right.

657
00:28:29,701 --> 00:28:32,670
It's not a legal argument.
Still been going on today.

658
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:35,010
These guys that are running for 
republican office,

659
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:38,100
it's still happening today.
You know what I mean?

660
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,470
Rick santorum was just talking about it 
recently.

661
00:28:40,471 --> 00:28:42,510
All these fucking dummies.
what does that guy.

662
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,240
I'm ted cruz.
That fucking dumb.

663
00:28:45,241 --> 00:28:50,241
He doesn't believe in it.
I'm just going to lose like you fucking 

664
00:28:50,241 --> 00:28:53,001
dumb ass.
There's enough people that that cleaned 

665
00:28:53,001 --> 00:28:54,150
to that stupidity that are still on 
their side for now.

666
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:59,151
They're like the last fucking 
confederate flag holdouts and is it is 

667
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:03,741
there or is there not something in the 
bible about it because I've heard some 

668
00:29:03,741 --> 00:29:05,310
men are not supposed to lie down with 
men and it's an abomination.

669
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,690
That's what it saYs,
but it says who you're dealing with.

670
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:13,530
MulTiple translations was to go,
yeah.

671
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,160
Well,
not only that,

672
00:29:14,161 --> 00:29:17,190
there's more than 2000 years ago,
the oldest versions of the bible that we

673
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:20,850
know of today are the dead sea scrolls 
and the dead sea scrolls,

674
00:29:20,851 --> 00:29:25,851
the only bible,
only version of the bible that's an 

675
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:26,540
aramaic,
and when they try to translate it,

676
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,770
like if the stories are similar but 
different,

677
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:33,950
so all sorts of wacky shit in the dead 
sea scrolls that isn't in any of the 

678
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:37,911
other books.
I knew the religious texts and then you 

679
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:38,670
go to the oldest versions of the bible 
is all in ancient hebrew.

680
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:44,030
Little fuck speaks ancient hebrew.
You've got to translate that to latin 

681
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:47,440
and they translated that to greek and a 
lot of shit gets missing in the process.

682
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:52,730
When they wrote ancient hebrew to 
ancient hebrew letters and numbers were 

683
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,550
interchangeable,
like words had numerical value to them,

684
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,780
like there was no number.

685
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,360
So the letter a was also the number one.
Yeah,

686
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:02,830
so it's just such a different context is
different.

687
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:07,860
There's a different meaning to 
everything they were saying like the 

688
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,531
word god and the word love.
They have the same numerical value and 

689
00:30:10,531 --> 00:30:13,090
numerical values are actually important 
in the.

690
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,580
When you're saying a sentence,
you know,

691
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:18,100
you say a sentence,
there's tone,

692
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:21,490
there's sarcasm there so you can see 
things in it.

693
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,340
That's why textIng is hard to exactly.
Are you mad at me like no man,

694
00:30:25,341 --> 00:30:26,120
we were fucking around.
You know,

695
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,870
sometimes people don't know I'm mad at 
you,

696
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
but in,
in ancient hebrew apparently it's hard 

697
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,430
for us to put it in perspective and kind
of understand the way they communicated,

698
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:41,700
but when they wrote things down,
there was inherent new miracle quality 

699
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,130
to the census.
They had lIke a,

700
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:46,240
some,
it was worth the sentence,

701
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,620
had numbers to it and I don't think 
we're.

702
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:53,670
There are 50 arguments against why the 
bible is real and there's one pro 

703
00:30:55,931 --> 00:30:59,530
argument which is I like it.
It makes me feel good.

704
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,410
That's the only argument you can give.
Well,

705
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:06,430
the idea that gOd would write one book a
long time ago to one dude and then go 

706
00:31:07,151 --> 00:31:11,620
off to manage grasshopper populations 
and make sure her gains happen.

707
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,180
Like,
where have you been man?

708
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:18,210
How come you don't tell us agaIn?
don't you understand there's 30 

709
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:18,850
different versions of this?
Wouldn't you want to carry it up?

710
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,290
Yeah,
you're a dick at this point.

711
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,320
Like if you made a quote like if you,
if there was a controversial issue that 

712
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:25,320
came up,
you know,

713
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,580
and you made a quote and then a bunch of
people took that quote and butchered it 

714
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,860
and twisted it up 15 different ways to 
sunday and you are aware of it,

715
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,860
wouldn't you want to correct that when 
you want to come back and Go,

716
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:36,170
whoa,
whoa,

717
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,640
whoa,
I didn't see you have to eat babies that

718
00:31:39,641 --> 00:31:40,810
are the color of orange.

719
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,580
THat is not what I said.
Like you guys are.

720
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,540
You guys fucked the whole thing up.
Yeah.

721
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,350
But not this god guy.
Yeah.

722
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,380
He's like,
I told you.

723
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,400
Yeah,
I told you.

724
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:53,660
Yeah.
I told you once I'm not and I'm not 

725
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:53,660
going to tell you again.
What did all these people that are lying

726
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,750
about what you said?
You got to figure out.

727
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,230
It's not my fault.
Not my problem.

728
00:31:56,231 --> 00:31:57,010
It's not my game,
bro.

729
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,710
Yeah.
No.

730
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:58,360
Yeah,
it's a.

731
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:01,570
There's so you believe in a god.
I don't not believe,

732
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:07,530
you know,
I think it would be super arrogant to 

733
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:07,530
say,
I don't believe in god.

734
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,810
I've seen so many things on psychedelic 
drugs that don't make any sense at all.

735
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:11,830
Then I'm like,
how?

736
00:32:11,831 --> 00:32:16,831
Why would I ever be so cocky as to think
that I have the whole framework of the 

737
00:32:16,831 --> 00:32:18,310
universe spelled out?
It's purely speculation.

738
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:23,340
Even for scientists like for scientists 
and scientists are studying the very 

739
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:29,011
nature of matter itself down to 
subatomic particles and quasars and 

740
00:32:29,011 --> 00:32:33,430
supernovas and gas clouds and all these 
different things that they're studying.

741
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,120
At the end of the day,
all they are really,

742
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:41,720
truly aware of is what they can perceive
their own senses in this existence.

743
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,850
They don't know what happens when you 
die.

744
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,500
They don't know if it's just a gateway 
to another new completely different kind

745
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:50,270
of experience.
They don't know,

746
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:54,110
and the idea that it's not that it's 
just death and it's black and darkness.

747
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:59,290
well,
where did you come from in the first 

748
00:32:59,290 --> 00:32:59,290
place?
Why are you even here?

749
00:32:59,290 --> 00:32:59,290
Why are you even here as a conscious 
entity?

750
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,360
Like why is the idea of you,
you thinking about you?

751
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:07,390
that is a real thing,
like what purpose does it serve and why 

752
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:10,841
is it,
why does it exist and is it possible 

753
00:33:10,841 --> 00:33:12,410
that this whole thing is just a long 
process,

754
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,530
sort of like a seed goes into the 
ground,

755
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:20,531
water gets on that seed,
this seed sprouts pops through the 

756
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:23,030
ground becomes a tree,
the tree gives fruit,

757
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,060
the fruit drops,
fruit that fruit goes into the ground,

758
00:33:26,061 --> 00:33:27,230
becomes new trees.

759
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:32,230
Animals eat those treats or nutrients 
for the next generation part of this 

760
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:36,251
weird,
crazy ecosystem and the ecosystem that 

761
00:33:36,251 --> 00:33:39,940
has that has created a human being with 
all their creativity and self awareness 

762
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:45,251
and all their ability to reflect and 
change and this crazy desire for 

763
00:33:45,251 --> 00:33:47,030
innovation like to have the newest,
greatest shit.

764
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,620
The biggest,
coolest thing,

765
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,590
the fastest thing,
the smartest thing,

766
00:33:51,591 --> 00:33:56,591
the most advanced thing.
We're constantly searching for this 

767
00:33:56,591 --> 00:33:56,591
newer,
better product.

768
00:33:56,591 --> 00:34:01,360
It would seem to me that all of that is 
a part of some almost inescapable 

769
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:06,800
process of change,
change and improvement and change.

770
00:34:06,801 --> 00:34:09,980
It seems like the whole thing is always 
changing,

771
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:15,220
right?
Like a cloud forms or rather a planet 

772
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:19,511
forms out of clouds and dust and all 
kinds of shit and eventually turns into 

773
00:34:19,511 --> 00:34:23,951
a planet eventually acquires water,
eventually has an atmosphere and then 

774
00:34:23,951 --> 00:34:28,391
life comes out of it in that life 
spreads out into other planets and all 

775
00:34:28,391 --> 00:34:32,141
of it seems to be this constant state of
either improvement or death improvement 

776
00:34:32,141 --> 00:34:37,031
and death improvement in death and to 
say that it's not building towards 

777
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:37,220
something.

778
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,570
It's like,
how the fuck do you know?

779
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:39,710
How do you know?
I mean,

780
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:44,711
we literally might be building towards 
heaven and if human beings with all of 

781
00:34:45,201 --> 00:34:48,980
our interest in trans rights and gay 
rights and being progressive,

782
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,340
I really contemplate this a lot.
I think about this all day.

783
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:56,930
I wonder if what we're doing by this 
movement that you say what's like,

784
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,480
some of it's exaggerated and ridiculous 
and some.

785
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:04,670
Some of the people that are involved in 
it are ultimately really shitty people 

786
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,930
that have attached themselves to an 
interesting idea,

787
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:11,140
but the trend seems to be inescapable 
and the trend of technological 

788
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,040
innovation as well as a trend of social 
awareness.

789
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,990
They might,
if you extrapolate,

790
00:35:14,991 --> 00:35:17,390
you look at where they're going,
like a thousand years now,

791
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,350
100,000
years now,

792
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:23,300
it might reach a point of really like a 
technologically created heaven.

793
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:29,080
It is totally possible,
a technologically creative having 

794
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:29,080
created by human beings.

795
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,700
It's created by whatever the fuck fuels 
a human being.

796
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,860
We will look at it as us like human 
beings.

797
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,400
We did it,
but what is the what?

798
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,440
The what is a human being?
I mean there's a bunch of different 

799
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,400
instincts and a bunch of different 
desires that are sort of sown into the 

800
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,900
existence of being a person and they're 
unacceptable,

801
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,920
inexorable,
you know,

802
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:47,550
you have them.
If you're living in the jungle,

803
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,730
you have them.
If you're living in the city you have.

804
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:54,731
I mean people just have this weird,
inescapable desire to do a bunch of core

805
00:35:54,781 --> 00:35:55,860
things.
Well,

806
00:35:55,861 --> 00:36:00,861
maybe those core things are very 
important and key ingredients towards 

807
00:36:00,861 --> 00:36:04,671
creating technology and towards creating
awareness and connection of ideas and 

808
00:36:04,671 --> 00:36:08,700
information from entity to entity until 
the the entire thing.

809
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:13,701
Thanks as one to the entire thing thinks
is one and has massive technological 

810
00:36:13,701 --> 00:36:18,471
capabilities and literally can escape 
the very dimension that is currently 

811
00:36:18,471 --> 00:36:20,700
trapped in the dimension that it thinks 
is all that there is.

812
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:24,150
This is all that there is because I can 
knock on it with my knuckles and I could

813
00:36:24,151 --> 00:36:27,810
put it on a scale and I could run a tape
measure by and tell you exactly how long

814
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,730
it is.
So that's what is real,

815
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:35,030
but that's not even what's real.
That's what's real right now that you 

816
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,911
can experience and we might be a part of
one continual never ending cycle that 

817
00:36:39,361 --> 00:36:42,000
ultimately leads to god.
Yeah.

818
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,830
Yeah.
Possible.

819
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:47,430
That's the thing I don't find to say you
don't say I don't believe.

820
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,930
No,
I don't think so either.

821
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:49,590
I don't think.
Well,

822
00:36:49,591 --> 00:36:50,880
I think it's arrogant to say,
you know,

823
00:36:50,881 --> 00:36:51,660
there's no go,
oh yeah.

824
00:36:51,661 --> 00:36:53,100
I don't think anyone knows.
There's no good,

825
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,070
but say I don't believe in god.
Yeah.

826
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,620
Okay.
Well,

827
00:36:55,621 --> 00:36:58,770
I don't believe in god either,
but I don't not believe in god.

828
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,180
Right.
Zero.

829
00:37:00,181 --> 00:37:01,350
God,
I dunno.

830
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,320
Yeah.
I've met some crazy shit and psychedelic

831
00:37:04,321 --> 00:37:05,580
trips.
You know,

832
00:37:05,581 --> 00:37:05,910
I've,
I've,

833
00:37:05,911 --> 00:37:07,620
I've had a couple of examples if you 
can.

834
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,160
Well,
I'm things that knew everything that 

835
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:13,650
I've ever done,
everything that I've ever said and who I

836
00:37:13,651 --> 00:37:17,400
was exactly down to the core thing.
What do you mean things?

837
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,070
Entities,
they're can see right through you now.

838
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,520
What are those entities or this trip or 
this,

839
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:26,100
this is like you meet this guy and he 
knows everything.

840
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,780
Well you're,
you're not meeting a guy.

841
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:32,220
You're meeting like a geometric pattern 
that is like you can't.

842
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,640
Especially dmt trips.
You can't really isolate what something 

843
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,310
looks like because it only looks like 
that for the briefest of moments and 

844
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:44,721
then it changes and looks like something
else and it changes and as you think 

845
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:48,081
about what it is it alters and it's 
almost like some bizarre lesson in 

846
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:52,941
perception and the and your own 
definitions of the world around you that

847
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:54,540
you are in some way.

848
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:59,570
BY the way,
you interface with the world changing 

849
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,470
the very nature of the world itself and 
this is like some weird lesson that they

850
00:38:01,471 --> 00:38:04,410
try to teach you while you're.
WhIle you're involved in these trips,

851
00:38:04,411 --> 00:38:06,980
it seems like they're trying to explain 
to you there's.

852
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:11,130
It's not just you have a bad attitude or
not just anybody has a bad attitude.

853
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:15,870
It's not just that you go,
you get tied up in the momentum of those

854
00:38:15,871 --> 00:38:20,871
bad attitudes and the mistakes caused by
those bad attitudes and the energy 

855
00:38:20,871 --> 00:38:23,430
that's put out and the ripple effect of 
all that energy and how's it,

856
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:28,460
how it goes out into the rest of the 
population and how it comes back to you 

857
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,690
and you get trapped like a goddamn 
spiderweb and explains it to you.

858
00:38:30,691 --> 00:38:35,691
That literally the way that you 
interface with the world changes the 

859
00:38:35,691 --> 00:38:36,430
world,
changes your world,

860
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,230
changes the people that are in your 
world,

861
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,440
but also changes how those people 
interact with other people in the world 

862
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,660
as this very freaky fucking bizarre 
thing to have that be told to you by 

863
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:53,130
gestures like giant,
like gestures who have like 

864
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,310
multidimensional head that's like 
spinning around and giving me the finger

865
00:38:55,311 --> 00:38:55,490
and.

866
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:58,780
But I would say that's just your own,
your own consciousness.

867
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,750
It may be that as a person,
it may be,

868
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,430
or an entity or a wall or whatever.
It's totally possible.

869
00:39:03,431 --> 00:39:05,890
We don't know what your own 
consciousness really means.

870
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,640
Yeah,
I mean,

871
00:39:06,641 --> 00:39:07,330
first of all,
look,

872
00:39:07,331 --> 00:39:12,331
a human being is not an individual.
Every human being is a host of an 

873
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:17,460
unknown variable.
I mean like literally an uncountable 

874
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,851
number of bugs,
like the amount of parasites and the 

875
00:39:20,851 --> 00:39:24,100
amount of different bacteria.
They say there's more cola in a person's

876
00:39:24,101 --> 00:39:26,590
body than there have ever been people 
ever.

877
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,980
So think of that.
Does this what?

878
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,950
Just to just to stop and think about and
you need that.

879
00:39:32,951 --> 00:39:35,990
If that's not in your body,
you're fucked some shit.

880
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:39,190
Like the fact that we even know what he 
call is like,

881
00:39:39,191 --> 00:39:42,010
science is fucking like the last 70,
80 years.

882
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,360
It's just like,
what?

883
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,080
Yeah,
how,

884
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:49,200
what,
how to do even the fuck did you get 

885
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,200
what?
I had Brian Cox on the professor who's 

886
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,750
brilliant guy who works at cern,
who works at the large hadron collider.

887
00:39:55,751 --> 00:39:58,290
And he was trying to explain to the,
you know,

888
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:01,240
searching for the hadron in searching 
for the,

889
00:40:01,241 --> 00:40:06,241
um,
the higgs boson particle and it halfway 

890
00:40:06,241 --> 00:40:06,430
into the conversation like,
where,

891
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:08,650
why,
how did you guys find this out?

892
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,510
Who did,
what did you do?

893
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,040
You know,
we're just a couple of hundred years 

894
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,040
away from a guy making fire with steel 
and flint.

895
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,440
That's the onlY way they made fire 
clink,

896
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,400
clink,
clink.

897
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,310
That's how they had to make fire.
And you guys have figured this out.

898
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,720
Yeah.
What the fuck,

899
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:23,710
man?
Yeah,

900
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:24,790
It's a,
it's an,

901
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,910
it's unbelievable.
It's really hard to believe.

902
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:28,780
Yeah.
Very,

903
00:40:28,781 --> 00:40:30,330
very,
very hard to wrap your head around.

904
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,260
What are they going at with the higgs 
boson,

905
00:40:32,261 --> 00:40:33,710
by them?
What are they trying to figure out?

906
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,700
What will that lead to while they're 
trying to recreate?

907
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:41,701
And they,
they have apparently recreated the 

908
00:40:41,701 --> 00:40:44,431
conditions milliseconds after the big 
bang and prove that there is this one 

909
00:40:44,431 --> 00:40:48,980
particle that was theoretical up until 
recently and they've measured it there 

910
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:53,800
like 99 point nine percent sure that 
they've isolated this particle and 

911
00:40:54,281 --> 00:40:56,620
measured it.
but along the way they've also,

912
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:02,670
they've also identified a bunch of other
shit that they weren't sure if it was 

913
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,440
real or or created some things that were
just theoretical.

914
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:10,710
One is this stuff called clark cork glue
on cork glue on plasma that's insanely 

915
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:17,731
heavy.
Like if You had a bowling ball full of 

916
00:41:17,731 --> 00:41:17,731
this stuff,
it'd be heavier than the world.

917
00:41:17,731 --> 00:41:22,260
Yeah.
And they've figured out how to isolate 

918
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:22,630
that.
And it's also the same sort of thing.

919
00:41:22,631 --> 00:41:25,960
It's something that exists like 
milliseconds after the big bang.

920
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:30,100
It's like a part of the very creation of
the universe itself.

921
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,970
So there won't necessarily be like.
And if this is then

922
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,240
we'll then all get the floating 
skateboard.

923
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:39,200
You see the floating skateboard 
yesterday did of unbelievable.

924
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:44,260
But I'll pull up.
What's funny is how long it took me to 

925
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:44,260
get used to it though.
I'm like,

926
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:47,381
oh good,
there's a floating skateboard and I 

927
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:47,381
like.
And you just go back to your dumb life.

928
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:48,080
You're not like,
oh fuck,

929
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,320
we got to get good.
Okay.

930
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:53,450
Yeah.
It'll be totally normal.

931
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:56,420
Yeah.
I mean a car is fucking insane.

932
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,910
If you didn't have a car and somebody 
gave you a car,

933
00:41:58,911 --> 00:42:03,911
is this it?
Lexus has created a real rideable 

934
00:42:03,911 --> 00:42:03,911
hoverboard.
Okay.

935
00:42:03,911 --> 00:42:08,261
So here's a guy with a skateboard and he
gets off and he stamps on it says there 

936
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:14,030
is no such thing as impossible and he's 
smoking.

937
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:15,720
I don't like the smoke.
I think that's a,

938
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,450
that's an after effect.
And I think it's stupid.

939
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,610
Uh,
I thought it's the best part of this ad.

940
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,820
Put it.
This guy is never going to smoke.

941
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:26,720
It's just a matter of figuring out how.
So he's going to stand on this now.

942
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,230
Lexis hoveR the not showing you any more
than that.

943
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,880
That's the tease.
You fucks.

944
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:34,940
That's it.
You got to see this new rx though.

945
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:35,720
This thing.
What is it?

946
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,150
I'm just kidding.
I'm a big fan of alexis's.

947
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:39,860
Yeah.
Japanese engineering.

948
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:42,350
It's a little slightly different than 
the german engineering.

949
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,360
All Of it's pretty fucking bad ass 
though.

950
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,300
Did you have the 400 damn whatsapp video
of the,

951
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:48,980
the,
like the 400 x.

952
00:42:48,981 --> 00:42:50,540
That one.
The alexIs?

953
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,430
No,
I have,

954
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:52,250
I have,
uh,

955
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,760
s suv.
the lx five slash 70.

956
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,780
Oh,
why the rx?

957
00:42:56,781 --> 00:42:57,500
400.
Sorry.

958
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:59,270
Yeah,
they're fucking amazing.

959
00:42:59,271 --> 00:43:00,710
Driving living room.
Yeah,

960
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,990
it's smooth as fuck y'all.
Yeah.

961
00:43:02,991 --> 00:43:05,930
It's so fun.
Floaty floats down the highway.

962
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:11,990
They make amazing automobiles.
If you think about the fact that the 

963
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:15,581
automobile has only been around for a 
little over 100 years to the amount of 

964
00:43:15,581 --> 00:43:15,581
innovation that's happened with that.

965
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:18,220
Yeah,
and that's when It's in maths.

966
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:21,590
Even retarded by other industries like 
it should be further along.

967
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:27,100
Well,
I think with this tesla shit like this 

968
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,680
elon musk character getting involved,
that guy's making an suv now that's 

969
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,570
going to be an all electric.
He's making a two door also.

970
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:37,900
He's making a bunch of shit,
but the fact that bigger thing that he 

971
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:37,900
did was he.
He like,

972
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,620
he basically gave up all his patents 
here.

973
00:43:39,621 --> 00:43:43,970
Just let's make it good.
Let's make this an actual thing.

974
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Well,
he's like a real life tOny stark type 

975
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,000
character.
Yeah.

976
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,130
He's got that new thing for the wall to 
new battery system for,

977
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,610
for solar.
For houses.

978
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:57,620
Yeah.
Because you can't get the thing that I 

979
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:57,620
didn't realize about solar.
She can't get.

980
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,300
He can't get it at night unless you 
store it.

981
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:00,760
Yeah,
you can't.

982
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:02,510
It's really,
really hard to store.

983
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,960
Well,
most of the time you have these solar 

984
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:07,960
rooms.
Like a,

985
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:12,070
there was a cabin a that a friend of 
mine has in Colorado and she's got these

986
00:44:12,501 --> 00:44:17,501
uh,
like solar batteries hooked up to the 

987
00:44:17,501 --> 00:44:18,050
cabin and you know,
it's like a room.

988
00:44:18,051 --> 00:44:20,480
Y'all gotta go into the battery rooM,
see what's going on.

989
00:44:20,481 --> 00:44:22,450
And the batteries were dead.
It was fucking awful.

990
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:24,940
But it was a real problem.
The guy who was staying in the cabinet,

991
00:44:24,941 --> 00:44:25,780
I was like,
what the fuck?

992
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:27,500
No,
fuck them lights,

993
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:28,370
you know,
stupid.

994
00:44:28,371 --> 00:44:29,500
We're camping here.
Yeah.

995
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:32,910
It just wasn't working correctly.
But with this ian Must thing.

996
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,070
Elon musk's is very small.
It's not that big.

997
00:44:36,071 --> 00:44:39,950
It's like a half about this guy and like
half the table.

998
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,470
LIke a small coffee table.
Yeah.

999
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,430
And you can put it on the wall.
Can you put it on the wall?

1000
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:44,880
Yeah,
yeah,

1001
00:44:44,881 --> 00:44:45,120
yeah.

1002
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,010
That's what it's for.
Power wall.

1003
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:48,200
Yeah.
See how it's got.

1004
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:51,720
It's up there at mounts to the wall.
It's cool to home battery.

1005
00:44:51,721 --> 00:44:56,721
That charges using electricity generated
from solar panels or when utility rates 

1006
00:44:56,721 --> 00:44:57,840
are low and powers your home in the 
evening,

1007
00:44:57,841 --> 00:45:01,320
it also fortifies your home against 
power outages by providing a backup.

1008
00:45:01,321 --> 00:45:03,670
Electricity supply.
Provable.

1009
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,730
That's goiNg to.
I have a volt.

1010
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:11,240
I was going to get a tesla and I got the
chevy volt because someone pointed out 

1011
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,960
what if there's a power outage?
Yep.

1012
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,940
That'll do it.
Yeah.

1013
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,440
The volt takes both,
right?

1014
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:17,150
Is that the deal?
no,

1015
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:17,890
the volt.
Yeah.

1016
00:45:17,891 --> 00:45:18,980
The volt takes both it.
Yeah.

1017
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,150
I can go to gas when the revolution 
comes.

1018
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:22,830
I can.
That's a smart move right now.

1019
00:45:22,831 --> 00:45:25,410
You've got your feet in both worlds.
A little bit of both.

1020
00:45:25,411 --> 00:45:27,900
Joe,
do you,

1021
00:45:27,901 --> 00:45:30,600
when you put it up with gas,
does it charge the battery?

1022
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:36,650
No,
it basically you get 40 miles of 

1023
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:36,750
electric,
just sure electric.

1024
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:38,670
Yeah,
and then once you.

1025
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:40,350
That's pretty stupid.
I'm being honest.

1026
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:45,470
What do you mean not enough?
The average person drives 36 miles a 

1027
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:49,671
day,
but what about those extra four miles 

1028
00:45:49,671 --> 00:45:49,671
and you'd go to get a sandwich and 
throw,

1029
00:45:49,671 --> 00:45:52,920
which is a drip.
A gas station were cast out.

1030
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,280
Oh,
you're telling me when the revolution 

1031
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:58,280
comes?
Uh,

1032
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:58,280
yeah.
I don't know what to tell you.

1033
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:01,460
You better have a power wall.
you got to have one of them yellow.

1034
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:02,580
Elon musk.
Yeah.

1035
00:46:02,581 --> 00:46:04,150
But even then it's probably.
Although no,

1036
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:08,250
if you have the solar,
well solar is only going to work as long

1037
00:46:08,251 --> 00:46:10,140
as the fucking weather stays exactly the
same.

1038
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,390
If you have solar and you live in a 
place like columbus,

1039
00:46:12,391 --> 00:46:14,310
Ohio in the winter,
good luck.

1040
00:46:14,311 --> 00:46:15,300
Fuck face.
Yeah.

1041
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:20,390
You're not going to get much power 
unless they develop some sort of new 

1042
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:20,390
shit.

1043
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:21,820
BuT if your skies are gray,
like where I grew up in boston winters,

1044
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,520
all gray,
everything's gray.

1045
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:26,370
You're not gonna met and put maybe those
new ones actually,

1046
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:31,770
they're better.
They got to be getting better with 

1047
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:34,190
overcast shit,
but it's not like being out in the 

1048
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:34,190
desert,
palm springs,

1049
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:35,370
no shit like that.
We could just power the whole world from

1050
00:46:35,371 --> 00:46:35,850
it.
Yeah.

1051
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:38,700
Hopefully that'll happen in the next 15,
20 years.

1052
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:43,760
What's amazing when you look at la,
I mean the one resource that we have in 

1053
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,460
abundance is sunshine.
I mean that is the,

1054
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:49,600
our research really nothing with it very
little because we don't have to because 

1055
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,520
the dwp has a monopoly.
Are you worried about the water?

1056
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,570
Yes.
Yeah,

1057
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,030
me too.
How could you not be like,

1058
00:46:57,031 --> 00:46:58,800
I don't know what's going to happen?
Well,

1059
00:46:58,801 --> 00:47:00,860
we're not going to have much water.
Yeah,

1060
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:04,930
that's going to happen.
So that's a new normal thing now.

1061
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:10,330
Like essentially we're a,
we're a giant desert city and they're 

1062
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:10,950
going to try actually admitting what 
were like,

1063
00:47:10,951 --> 00:47:11,940
no.
Yeah,

1064
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:14,850
well we're a desert city that had 
intermittent rainfall,

1065
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:17,250
intermittent rainfall,
but the reason why la was created in the

1066
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:22,251
first place as a hollywood,
as a movie production place was because 

1067
00:47:22,251 --> 00:47:23,470
it was so consistent with its winter.
That's the whole meat.

1068
00:47:23,471 --> 00:47:25,860
That means you live in a place that 
sucks.

1069
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,570
I mean,
it's great for the sun,

1070
00:47:27,571 --> 00:47:28,040
but it's.
Yeah,

1071
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:30,010
it's not good for life.
Well

1072
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,180
yet.
We're not supposed to be here.

1073
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:32,290
Yeah,
it's not.

1074
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:34,690
It's not inhabitable unless you do a lot
of shit,

1075
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:37,630
unless you'd like.
We're going to reroute the Colorado.

1076
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:38,470
It's just like,
dude,

1077
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:41,320
Maybe we just just stay near the 
Colorado river.

1078
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:46,740
Well,
what's interestinG is with climate 

1079
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:49,021
change,
one of the things I'm keeping an eye on 

1080
00:47:49,021 --> 00:47:49,021
iS what happens to seattle's,
whether,

1081
00:47:49,021 --> 00:47:50,650
because I have a buddy who just moved up
to seattle theory about that.

1082
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,480
Yeah.
And he fucking said this.

1083
00:47:52,481 --> 00:47:54,640
Winter was amazing.
He was like,

1084
00:47:54,641 --> 00:47:55,990
dude,
it barely reined.

1085
00:47:55,991 --> 00:48:00,991
It wasn't that clOudy.
It was wonderful and he was coming from 

1086
00:48:00,991 --> 00:48:00,991
brooklyn.
I think seattle,

1087
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:06,180
portland and seattle become la and 
vancouver becomes san francisco too.

1088
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:07,990
I like the way you think.
Yeah,

1089
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:11,380
I think that's in like 50 years,
you're probably dead,

1090
00:48:11,381 --> 00:48:12,910
right?
You're dead,

1091
00:48:12,911 --> 00:48:14,220
right?
I'm a big five.

1092
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:17,350
Seattle getting property in vancouver a 
bunch.

1093
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:19,980
You feel like I'm really.
I'm really done.

1094
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:22,090
The race are very expensive.
Real esTate in vancouver.

1095
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,430
Yes.
But a lot of beautiful asian girls.

1096
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,860
Oh shit.
Someone is thinking,

1097
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:32,320
well,
they're great canadians.

1098
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:34,560
First of all,
canadian girls to just.

1099
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,340
They're just,
they're reasonable.

1100
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,640
Yeah,
they're more chill.

1101
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:39,370
They're fun.
They're more fun.

1102
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,080
Yeah,
they're less.

1103
00:48:41,081 --> 00:48:42,790
Uh,
I found they've been less.

1104
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:43,840
Jay.
You did.

1105
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,520
They're less.
I don't know,

1106
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:50,550
the hottest girls.
I have a better chance with hot age and 

1107
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:51,280
a hot canadian girls than I do with hud.
American girls.

1108
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,650
Hmm.
Like the hottest girls I've dated.

1109
00:48:53,651 --> 00:48:54,790
Generally.
We're canadian.

1110
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:55,790
Really?
Yeah.

1111
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,650
You think they're less worried about 
looks and more worried about.

1112
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:04,740
I think they're just more.
They actually like care if you're nice 

1113
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:08,281
and cool and chill and decent.
Well their whole culture is just so 

1114
00:49:08,281 --> 00:49:11,920
different because it didn't come from 
this marauding take over the world.

1115
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,130
sort of a mentality that the,
the United States,

1116
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:20,140
as you know in the United States has 
this leader of the world go fuck 

1117
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:20,350
yourself.
America free.

1118
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:22,360
toby keith.
You know they don't.

1119
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:24,670
They don't have that up in Canada.
they don't have any of that.

1120
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:30,050
I lot of times I think like the military
industrial complex is just because we 

1121
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:30,940
have the bumps.
It's like,

1122
00:49:30,941 --> 00:49:32,410
well,
we got the bumps.

1123
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:36,130
It's like we got the avocados,
we gotta make some fucking guacamole,

1124
00:49:36,131 --> 00:49:38,340
man.
We fucking paid for the bumps.

1125
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:41,350
It's fucking use these things.
We'll talk about a cycle.

1126
00:49:41,351 --> 00:49:46,351
That's the cycle.
It's like you can't not extract that 

1127
00:49:46,351 --> 00:49:46,750
money.
The people that are making bombs and the

1128
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:49,360
people that are involved in the and they
can't not do that.

1129
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:51,460
If they see that they're not going to 
stop,

1130
00:49:51,461 --> 00:49:53,390
it's too much money.
They're not going to stop asking.

1131
00:49:53,391 --> 00:49:54,520
We just have to stop giving it to them.

1132
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:57,940
What do you make of the thing of like?
Well,

1133
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,890
the thing of light lost jobs because 
that,

1134
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:04,960
that's not an argument to me.
Lost jobs from the military industrial 

1135
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:05,760
complex.
Like we ain't got away.

1136
00:50:05,761 --> 00:50:06,460
We're going to,
man,

1137
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,890
I got 8,000
people in my district and all that shit.

1138
00:50:08,891 --> 00:50:09,280
It's like,
well,

1139
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:11,530
fucking having to do something else.
Same thing with coal.

1140
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,600
They say that about coal industry.
They said about horseshoes.

1141
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:15,730
Yeah,
exactly.

1142
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:16,690
Yeah,
precisely.

1143
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,210
It's like,
well,

1144
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:18,770
what about the blacksmiths?
Yeah.

1145
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:23,500
He put in a lot of black students at 
your fancy fucking fancy car.

1146
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:25,780
Well,
that's the other thing is when computers

1147
00:50:25,781 --> 00:50:28,070
and robots take over,
there

1148
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:33,070
will be blue collar people breaking into
factories to beat up the robots.

1149
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:40,160
Probably.
They really go in the sledge hammers and

1150
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:43,040
they'll start,
which I believe is the,

1151
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:46,610
uh,
is the definition of a,

1152
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:51,611
a what a luddite is,
are people that were so anti.

1153
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:54,860
Yes.
Robot that they beat them up.

1154
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:56,360
They beat machines up.
Right.

1155
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:01,440
It wasn't really.
Was so fucking wrong.

1156
00:51:01,671 --> 00:51:02,750
Yeah.
they're not wrong.

1157
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,330
Yeah.
That was,

1158
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:04,970
that was like during the industrial age,
right?

1159
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:08,240
Look at this member of any bands of 
english workers who destroyed machinery,

1160
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:13,390
especially in cotton and woolen mills 
and they believe with threatening their 

1161
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:14,840
jobs in 18,
11 to 18,

1162
00:51:14,841 --> 00:51:16,040
60.
That will be,

1163
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:20,330
that will be a he,
I believe that will be a huge thing.

1164
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:22,030
Yeah.
It's like.

1165
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:25,330
But stan hopes you ever hear stainless 
bit about like should,

1166
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,090
where they're like,
oh,

1167
00:51:26,091 --> 00:51:28,190
it's only a five percent unemployment.

1168
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:33,220
It's like,
shouldn't we be going for hundred 

1169
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:33,710
percent unemployment?
Like don't we all just not want to work?

1170
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:38,740
Like why are we going toward this 
fucking dumb work thing when we could 

1171
00:51:38,871 --> 00:51:40,700
just.
Why don't we all figure it out?

1172
00:51:40,701 --> 00:51:45,701
So we'd.
none of us have to work because people 

1173
00:51:45,701 --> 00:51:48,311
have associated working with making 
money and making money with staying 

1174
00:51:48,311 --> 00:51:52,121
alive and the only way you can 
contribute as if you work and the only 

1175
00:51:52,121 --> 00:51:53,870
way you can get money to stay alive as 
if you were in this.

1176
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,250
The one thing that everybody's worried 
about,

1177
00:51:55,251 --> 00:51:56,720
right?
Everybody's worried about not being able

1178
00:51:56,721 --> 00:51:59,000
to pay their bills and starving to 
death.

1179
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:04,030
Yeah.
HavIng their children go hungry and 

1180
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:04,030
like,
fuck,

1181
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,951
what if we.
What if we live like the places that we 

1182
00:52:05,951 --> 00:52:08,471
know exist all over the world and this 
place is all over the world where 

1183
00:52:08,471 --> 00:52:08,471
children go hungry.

1184
00:52:08,471 --> 00:52:13,060
Well,
there's also that protestant work ethic 

1185
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:13,060
thing where it's like it's next to 
godliness.

1186
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:16,010
It becomes one,
two gods smiled.

1187
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,840
You know what I mean?
Like when the man work,

1188
00:52:17,841 --> 00:52:22,841
like that's a huge tenant.
Well don't you think that that's one of 

1189
00:52:22,841 --> 00:52:22,940
those,
those tenants that those existed because

1190
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:27,970
they were trying to instill this idea of
you have to stay alive and so it's good 

1191
00:52:28,371 --> 00:52:29,360
to,
to work hard.

1192
00:52:29,361 --> 00:52:32,120
It's nobody wants to fucking farm and 
plow the fields,

1193
00:52:32,121 --> 00:52:34,550
but if you don't do it,
we're all going to fucking star,

1194
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:38,240
so let's make it a religious ethic.
Let's make it a super important thing to

1195
00:52:38,241 --> 00:52:40,900
god really likes and when you plow,
god loves it.

1196
00:52:40,901 --> 00:52:42,410
When you plant seeds,
sow the seed.

1197
00:52:42,411 --> 00:52:43,330
Go do it.
Yeah,

1198
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,310
I'd loves it.
Is it even possible to have,

1199
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:49,010
would that be possible to have it 100 
percent unemployment?

1200
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,780
You know like could society.

1201
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:54,160
Society is based on bartering and 
trading and.

1202
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:59,240
Yeah,
and there's also work that people like 

1203
00:52:59,240 --> 00:52:59,240
to do.
What about that?

1204
00:52:59,240 --> 00:52:59,640
What if you're a dentist and you enjoy 
doing dentistry?

1205
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:03,380
You want 100 percent employment 
placement and I have all these clients.

1206
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:05,870
I enjoy fixing their teeth.
What's the fucking robots,

1207
00:53:05,871 --> 00:53:07,220
bro?
I went to school for it.

1208
00:53:07,221 --> 00:53:08,720
I'm fascinated.
I got robots though,

1209
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:13,910
but you didn't go to school,
but you didn't go to school.

1210
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:17,900
You didn't have people that are car 
enthusiasts that fix cars.

1211
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:21,500
What about people that make clothes that
are really into designing clothes?

1212
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:26,870
I you still do it,
but the idea that you have to do it to 

1213
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:26,870
survive,

1214
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,530
I think it's just an intro.
I don't disagree with them.

1215
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:33,610
Hmm.
Like that you'd want someone in this 

1216
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:34,110
robot's someone would have to make the 
robots.

1217
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:35,460
Right.
That's work,

1218
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,880
but at some point someone's going to 
have to work in the robots.

1219
00:53:38,881 --> 00:53:42,890
Even if there's robots making robots,
someone has to serve as the superhero.

1220
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:47,940
You know what I mean?
Like so someone's going to have to work 

1221
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:50,810
and then that guy is going to want shit 
for the work he did and then it just 

1222
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:50,810
becomes a bartering society.

1223
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:54,150
It doesn't seem like it's ever possible 
to go to 100 percent,

1224
00:53:54,151 --> 00:53:57,000
but you might be able to get down to 
like 10 percent plus robots.

1225
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:00,360
Yeah.
If you get down to 10 percent working 90

1226
00:54:00,361 --> 00:54:05,361
percent,
that's an imposing sentence by blank 

1227
00:54:05,361 --> 00:54:05,361
blank plus robots.
Yeah.

1228
00:54:05,361 --> 00:54:05,880
Because once you've got robots in the 
mix,

1229
00:54:05,881 --> 00:54:10,881
everything changes.
You don't need a whole lot of people to 

1230
00:54:10,881 --> 00:54:13,161
run the robot because you get robots 
that fix robots and the robots to fix 

1231
00:54:13,161 --> 00:54:13,620
the robot,
to fix the robots.

1232
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:17,820
Who watches the watch with water?
That is robots.

1233
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:22,821
The robots.
I mean you would have to make sure that 

1234
00:54:22,821 --> 00:54:24,170
also that the people that did do all the
work were they,

1235
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:29,180
that you kept a steady supply of them 
and kept them educated because if you 

1236
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:32,010
didn't and then we ran out of people 
that knew how to fix the robots and then

1237
00:54:32,011 --> 00:54:34,680
we're just scrambling like we have to 
relearn how to fix robots.

1238
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:40,230
There was a book,
I think it was a white noise,

1239
00:54:40,231 --> 00:54:41,730
don delillo,
but it talked about like,

1240
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,750
I couldn't fucking fix a clock.
I couldn't fix it.

1241
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:48,870
I couldn't fix the light.
I couldn't fix any if something.

1242
00:54:48,871 --> 00:54:52,980
Like if I was the last guy,
like I couldn't fix shit at all.

1243
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:58,440
We know how to hold bit about that,
about dumb people like not realizing 

1244
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:03,351
they're dumb because they buy a lot of 
smart things that other people figured 

1245
00:55:03,351 --> 00:55:06,291
out.
then one day the power goes out and I'm 

1246
00:55:06,291 --> 00:55:06,291
like,
what do you do when the power goes out?

1247
00:55:06,291 --> 00:55:09,920
Well,
what I usually do is I sit around and 

1248
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:09,920
wait.
I figured someone's fixing that shit.

1249
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,330
Then that person is that person's dead 
and no one would know what happened to.

1250
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,070
Yeah.
And the,

1251
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:20,150
uh,
the idea that job was if I left you 

1252
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,771
alone alone in the woods with a hatchet,
how long before you could send me an 

1253
00:55:21,771 --> 00:55:21,771
email like,
oh,

1254
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:26,930
how long would it take?
Nobody knows how to make a fucking 

1255
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:26,930
computer.
Nobody knows how to build an engine.

1256
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:29,580
Who the fuck knows how to forge metal,
pull it,

1257
00:55:29,581 --> 00:55:32,420
pull it out of the ground and turn into 
a cash buyer.

1258
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:34,020
You know what I mean?
I couldn't.

1259
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:36,570
I meAn I would literally,
if I started a fire,

1260
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:39,450
it would be based on shit I saw on 
survivor.

1261
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:45,050
I swear to god.
I think I could start a fire if I have 

1262
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:48,231
the right stuff,
but you have to make sure you have the 

1263
00:55:48,231 --> 00:55:49,440
right stuff and it wouldn't be easy.
It's not easy at all.

1264
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:53,280
Like you'd have to have rope and a stick
and stick.

1265
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:56,610
Yeah.
Like that sort of thing that they do.

1266
00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:00,740
It becomes a bow and then like it seems,
I don't know when to like

1267
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,290
yo go over to the thing to the.
Well,

1268
00:56:03,291 --> 00:56:04,740
you know,
there's a guy on,

1269
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:05,360
on,
um,

1270
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:10,420
there's a show called life below zero 
and this fucking dude doesn't bring 

1271
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:12,030
matches with him because he doesn't want
to rely on matches because what if I,

1272
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:13,510
what if I run out of matches?
Yeah,

1273
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:14,760
I would if I rely on live.
So he,

1274
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:17,530
his mouthpiece thAt he puts in and then 
he has a stick,

1275
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:19,300
put cv,
there's a video of it.

1276
00:56:19,301 --> 00:56:24,070
His name is glenn.
Pull up glenn from life below zero,

1277
00:56:24,071 --> 00:56:27,130
makes a fire on youtube and he puts this
bit,

1278
00:56:27,131 --> 00:56:31,990
is this piece in his mouth and the piece
like clamps down on the top of the stick

1279
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:35,560
so that he could use the bow with two 
hands and really get a lot of friction.

1280
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:40,600
so you as the bow that's wrapped around 
those string of the bose wrapped around 

1281
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,470
the stick and he's going right to left,
right to left,

1282
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,400
right to left,
right to left.

1283
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:44,710
And as,
as it spins,

1284
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:49,711
the friction starts,
see little smoke and he's pushing like 

1285
00:56:49,711 --> 00:56:52,770
dry can tinder in there.
And then he gets like a little ball of 

1286
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:54,900
fire and then he builds it up.
How long have you see it?

1287
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:56,520
It doesn't.
No.

1288
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:58,750
It doesn't make too much to carry around
in your mouth,

1289
00:56:59,070 --> 00:56:59,450
right?
Sure.

1290
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:01,090
It has to be online.
If it's not online,

1291
00:57:01,091 --> 00:57:02,680
they should be fired.
Here we go.

1292
00:57:02,681 --> 00:57:03,880
Here we go.
So this guy,

1293
00:57:03,881 --> 00:57:05,290
this is how he does it all the time.
Give it some,

1294
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:06,790
some volume.
So we'll see.

1295
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:09,490
I don't use a headlamp because what 
happens if I run out of headlamps?

1296
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:11,500
It's true.
It's 40 below zero waste.

1297
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:14,050
Filming what this mouthpiece is made out
of caribou.

1298
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:20,220
This guy's supported living so gangster 
up there.

1299
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,190
So he holds his caribou antler piece in 
his mouth.

1300
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,160
Then he wraps a string around his 
fucker.

1301
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:28,920
Watch how he does this.
This is pretty wild.

1302
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:33,560
So he's pulling right left,
right,

1303
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:34,140
right,
right.

1304
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,000
And watch how quick it works.
Wow.

1305
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,150
Isn't that nuts?
yeah.

1306
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:44,470
It's incredible.
And he has this fire starting thing.

1307
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:47,540
Any reuse it over and over again because
the more he does it,

1308
00:57:47,541 --> 00:57:50,000
his teeth are ruined.
We should point out yes.

1309
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:52,240
Either fart bite,
not caribou antlers.

1310
00:57:52,241 --> 00:57:57,241
Bitch was trying to do.
And so then he reuses that the little 

1311
00:57:57,281 --> 00:58:00,400
thin plate of wood that he has 
underneath it.

1312
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:04,150
Reuse that over and over again.
So it's sort of blAck and charred,

1313
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,550
which makes it a little bit more 
flammable.

1314
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:07,510
None.
AmazIng.

1315
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:09,130
That's awesome.
saw this motherfucker.

1316
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:10,860
Makes her fire.
And you saw a quick.

1317
00:58:10,861 --> 00:58:11,650
It was.
Yeah.

1318
00:58:11,651 --> 00:58:13,570
But joe kenney write a joke.
Nope,

1319
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:15,130
he's not perfect.
He's not.

1320
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:19,000
He's not the uber mush.
I have him write a sketch.

1321
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,220
Nope.
See how they look at you.

1322
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,210
You're.
Yeah.

1323
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:23,710
Well you think you could do this?
Hey,

1324
00:58:23,711 --> 00:58:26,740
strongest man.
Do a fucking strong seven bro.

1325
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,140
Yeah.
How about you write for chris rock?

1326
00:58:28,141 --> 00:58:31,150
Strongest man.
You fucking piece of fucking jumoke.

1327
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:33,460
Oh great.
You could pick up a big stone ball.

1328
00:58:33,461 --> 00:58:38,461
You fucking done.
You know what else can do that 

1329
00:58:38,461 --> 00:58:38,461
attractor?
Yeah.

1330
00:58:38,461 --> 00:58:39,390
You're human tractor.
Fuckface yeah.

1331
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,830
With jokes.
Yeah.

1332
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:42,460
Go do,

1333
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:47,700
Take seven.
The crowd up your warm.

1334
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:49,390
The crowd up for at midnight.

1335
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:54,850
Brody's job.
Enjoy it.

1336
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,770
Eight one.
He yelled out.

1337
00:58:56,771 --> 00:59:01,771
Eight.
One eight till I die last night on 

1338
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:03,311
stage.
And the fucking place broke out into 

1339
00:59:03,311 --> 00:59:05,191
applause when he was at the ice house 
last night when he was hilarious.

1340
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,140
Yeah,
he's very funny.

1341
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:11,500
But the yelling out eight,
one eight till I die.

1342
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:16,390
and the place just wet.
Yeah.

1343
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:18,640
That's great.
They know,

1344
00:59:18,641 --> 00:59:20,770
they know what to expect from brody 
stevens.

1345
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:22,070
I like that.
He's

1346
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:27,350
like carved out a little thing from some
people have like really like kimmel.

1347
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:32,410
Those kinds of guys like people who 
really appreciate brody have made a big 

1348
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:33,740
girl.
But zach alpha access to.

1349
00:59:33,741 --> 00:59:34,280
Yeah,
big,

1350
00:59:34,281 --> 00:59:37,310
big fan made a big deal about them.
It's really,

1351
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:42,340
it's nice to see them getting.
He still doesn't get the attention that 

1352
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:43,280
it deserves.
I want to do something where we do it in

1353
00:59:43,281 --> 00:59:47,780
conjunction with the comedy store and we
filmed brody's late night sets.

1354
00:59:47,781 --> 00:59:50,570
Just film a gang of them and then find 
the gem,

1355
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:54,770
find that one jam and take that and turn
it into a comedy special.

1356
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:59,890
Yeah.
Because someone easy to do because some 

1357
00:59:59,890 --> 00:59:59,890
of those shelves that he Does,
those late night shows,

1358
00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:03,530
they're just fucking magical.
Magical shows.

1359
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:05,480
Like very inspired.
Yeah.

1360
01:00:05,481 --> 01:00:09,020
Just not off the fucking charts weird,
you know,

1361
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:14,170
the narratives that he creates in the 
audience with the various people that 

1362
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:17,621
he's fucking around with all completely 
ad lib as opposed to those fake ad lib 

1363
01:00:17,621 --> 01:00:17,810
guys.

1364
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:22,360
You know those fake ad lib guys I know 
exists.

1365
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:24,250
I haven't caught anyone.
Oh,

1366
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:27,110
you know what I mean?
Are there some that we know?

1367
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:28,280
Oh yeah.
Okay.

1368
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:29,510
Yeah,
there's a lot.

1369
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:32,060
Not that much anymore because people are
getting hip to it,

1370
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:36,190
but there used to be a bunch of guys who
every night would pretend,

1371
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:37,790
look at this guy.
He's thinking,

1372
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:40,790
well,
he's like,

1373
01:00:40,791 --> 01:00:42,050
well,
and she's wired wrong,

1374
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:44,120
but they say the same thing every night 
and everyone like,

1375
01:00:44,121 --> 01:00:45,350
oh my god,
it's so brilliant.

1376
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:47,030
Yeah.
But it's really an act.

1377
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:50,810
It's an act that pretends to be an ad 
libbed act.

1378
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:53,680
Yeah.
I would agree with that motherfucker.

1379
01:00:53,790 --> 01:00:55,350
This motherfucker making,
you know,

1380
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,420
how dare they make 61 grand a year?
How dare they feel lucky.

1381
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:03,110
Yeah.
So tell me about this fucking thing that

1382
01:01:03,111 --> 01:01:04,190
you just did.
All right.

1383
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:08,210
For anybody who doesn't know what 
ketamine is,

1384
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:09,380
I will tell them.

1385
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:12,620
I'll tell the whole narrative.
The last one of the times I was here,

1386
01:01:12,621 --> 01:01:14,230
we talked about five htP.
Yeah.

1387
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:15,950
Um,
that was a long time ago.

1388
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:19,880
That got me into it and that's how when 
we started creating new mood.

1389
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,310
Yeah.
so I taken five htp.

1390
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:25,040
I basically had depression most of my 
adult life,

1391
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:27,110
probably my whole life.
ANd uh,

1392
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:31,580
and when you define depression,
like right now I'm talking to you.

1393
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:32,750
We're hanging out,
we're having fun,

1394
01:01:32,751 --> 01:01:35,140
we're laughing.
Everything seems cool right now.

1395
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:35,990
You're great.
Yeah.

1396
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:39,290
When does it slip in it?
Here's the thing,

1397
01:01:39,291 --> 01:01:41,270
it's not,
I was never suicidal.

1398
01:01:41,271 --> 01:01:43,870
It was never,
it was just like kind of a,

1399
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:48,940
like the best I could feel what I could 
feel his adrenaline and ego,

1400
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:53,150
do you know what I mean?
But it was never like joy,

1401
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,100
happiness,
sort of,

1402
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:59,840
you know,
like the more I'm fuzzy or stuff,

1403
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:03,440
so I couldn't feel.
It just didN't happen.

1404
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:04,910
No joy,
no happiness.

1405
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:06,200
Not really.
Again,

1406
01:02:06,201 --> 01:02:08,680
not but not miserable.
Okay.

1407
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:13,690
But let me ask you this,
while this is going on and great things 

1408
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:13,690
would happen to.
Yeah,

1409
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:13,700
like you had some great things 
happening.

1410
01:02:13,701 --> 01:02:15,500
first of all,
you know the cocreative chappelle show,

1411
01:02:15,501 --> 01:02:16,430
which is,
in my opinion,

1412
01:02:16,431 --> 01:02:18,410
the greatest sketch comedy the world's 
ever known.

1413
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:19,740
Yeah.
so that was a great thing.

1414
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:21,000
Yes.
During that time,

1415
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:21,840
was there joy?

1416
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:28,240
Uh,
there was ego ego and there was 

1417
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,520
adrenaline,
but there was never.

1418
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,770
It never felt like my brain would like 
talk me out of it.

1419
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:41,460
It would talk me out of why I should Be,
why I should enjoy it,

1420
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:44,210
if that makes sense.
like it would talk me out of it,

1421
01:02:44,211 --> 01:02:44,660
just like,
well,

1422
01:02:44,661 --> 01:02:45,300
yeah,
but you,

1423
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,890
you had a partner and you get to do 
this.

1424
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:50,430
Okay.
So your brain would tell you,

1425
01:02:50,431 --> 01:02:50,910
well,
you know,

1426
01:02:50,911 --> 01:02:52,500
you're doing well,
but let's be honest,

1427
01:02:52,501 --> 01:02:54,300
you're doing it beCause of dave 
chappelle and,

1428
01:02:54,301 --> 01:02:59,301
you know,
even though you're running is really 

1429
01:02:59,301 --> 01:03:00,771
great,
would it be so great if skippy from 

1430
01:03:00,771 --> 01:03:00,771
family ties are the star of the show?
The show would still,

1431
01:03:00,771 --> 01:03:01,710
I would say yes.
Okay.

1432
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:03,690
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

1433
01:03:03,691 --> 01:03:05,460
One hundred percent.
No disrespect to skippy.

1434
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,520
Yeah.
Um,

1435
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:07,540
so that was,

1436
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:12,730
that's when I knew I needed to go on 
antidepressants is I sold a script in 

1437
01:03:12,891 --> 01:03:17,891
like 1999 and I was on the phone with an
agent who was saying that to studios 

1438
01:03:20,331 --> 01:03:23,510
were bidding for it and I was driving up
labrea crying

1439
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,200
on the phone with the guy and tears were
running down my face.

1440
01:03:28,201 --> 01:03:29,220
I'm like,
this isn't right.

1441
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,570
wow.
Yeah.

1442
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:32,940
So you were crying because you still 
felt like shit.

1443
01:03:32,941 --> 01:03:33,290
Yeah,
just

1444
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,050
felt like shit.
Yeah.

1445
01:03:36,051 --> 01:03:38,240
I just felt like shit,
I am part of the shit was like,

1446
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,780
I can't even fucking enjoy this.
Right.

1447
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:42,520
You know what I mean?
Like just like I wish I could

1448
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:43,650
feel this shit.
Right.

1449
01:03:43,651 --> 01:03:47,010
So your tiers were like tiers of like,
god damn it,

1450
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,480
how come I can't even feel this?

1451
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:52,000
Like why even do this shit right if 
you're not.

1452
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:53,830
And that's what I would get out of his 
ego,

1453
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:59,920
like,
like adrenaline from being in a cool 

1454
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,360
situation or doing something cool or 
whatever.

1455
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:05,680
Even killing onstage.
Like for example,

1456
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:11,250
people,
when I know certain people get offstage 

1457
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:11,740
when,
for instance chris rock to bring them up

1458
01:04:11,741 --> 01:04:13,780
again,
when he gets off stage,

1459
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:19,020
he is the nicest.
He's so fucking gacked off of the crowd.

1460
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:25,800
He so just like high on adrenaline and 
like just good feeling and basically 

1461
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:26,210
like,
like,

1462
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:30,340
uh,
like just good,

1463
01:04:30,341 --> 01:04:32,980
like a fucking chemicals that are 
escaping me.

1464
01:04:32,981 --> 01:04:35,860
But like serotonin shit like that,
he's just hits yet domain san antonio,

1465
01:04:35,861 --> 01:04:37,410
he's just fucking flying,
right?

1466
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:40,150
I would never feel like that.
I feel like,

1467
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:41,290
oh,
I just fucking murdered.

1468
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,750
But I would never be like,
cause I'm,

1469
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:47,410
there was no,
I wouldn't enjoy it,

1470
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:49,000
enjoy it.

1471
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,610
I wouldn't enjoy it,
I wouldn't not enjoy it.

1472
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:53,410
But it was flat.
It was flat.

1473
01:04:53,411 --> 01:04:54,640
It was like,
I might not,

1474
01:04:54,641 --> 01:04:58,300
I might as well have not done that,
but it didn't.

1475
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,860
Me and deb one time talked about about 
getting upstaged.

1476
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,980
Sometimes you just want to take the mic 
and throw it down.

1477
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:03,370
[inaudible].
It's like,

1478
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:04,900
well fucking,
that didn't even help.

1479
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:07,030
Um,
so,

1480
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:10,420
so,
so I've taken antidepressants for,

1481
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:14,800
since I was crying on the price in 1999.
So,

1482
01:05:14,801 --> 01:05:19,801
uh,
so I took them and I zoloft at first 

1483
01:05:19,801 --> 01:05:23,701
were great,
really work well and I remember telling 

1484
01:05:23,701 --> 01:05:25,720
a chappelle,
I think I said I go,

1485
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:29,530
I now know why people dance.
Like that was how I knew like,

1486
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:34,560
oh,
this works because I understand the 

1487
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:38,161
feeling that it would make people want 
to dance or just like that sort of 

1488
01:05:38,161 --> 01:05:39,200
collective.
Um,

1489
01:05:40,890 --> 01:05:42,520
do you want to vive for lack of better 
word.

1490
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:45,340
So,
so did that.

1491
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:48,430
Took zoloft probably worked for 10 
years,

1492
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:49,330
nine,
10 years,

1493
01:05:49,331 --> 01:05:50,380
you know,
with very in fact,

1494
01:05:50,381 --> 01:05:51,850
but after awhile it just stopped 
working.

1495
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,020
Now when it stopped working,
when I or when I would try to go off it,

1496
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:01,920
my,
I would get like a tension in my.

1497
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:07,620
I'm a fucking temple that literally 
couldn't like a knot in my template.

1498
01:06:09,051 --> 01:06:12,340
Like if you needed to get massaged it 
would just form.

1499
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:17,850
And that's how I knew like oh,
I'm fucking depressed again because it 

1500
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:17,850
would just form.
Um,

1501
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,140
and what,
what was,

1502
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:22,140
when you said it wasn't working.
So what was the shift?

1503
01:06:22,141 --> 01:06:24,120
It starteD working in beginning.
It was great.

1504
01:06:24,121 --> 01:06:24,390
Yeah,

1505
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:27,830
there is a term for it and I always 
forget it,

1506
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:29,750
but it's like that.
It just stopped.

1507
01:06:29,751 --> 01:06:32,570
It's like an efficacy,
longterm efficacy.

1508
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:32,830
Just

1509
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:34,720
tampers decreases.
Yeah.

1510
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:37,210
And that's specific to zoloft.

1511
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:38,600
It's all them,
all of them.

1512
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:40,800
It can be all of them.
Um,

1513
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:46,180
so then I switched to a I've,
and then probably the last four or five 

1514
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:50,180
years I've switched a bunch because all 
the ones I tried had some side effect.

1515
01:06:51,530 --> 01:06:53,660
What is the feeling though that you have
on them?

1516
01:06:53,661 --> 01:06:57,500
Is it like a feeling of you have like 
more energy?

1517
01:06:57,501 --> 01:06:58,940
Do you have a little more enthusiasm?

1518
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:03,730
You have more.
You have like more generosity of spirit,

1519
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:04,850
if that makes sense.
Like,

1520
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:08,710
just like you want your less of like a 
hater.

1521
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:10,420
Hmm.
Uh,

1522
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:14,560
because you're not,
you don't feel so depleted yourself that

1523
01:07:14,561 --> 01:07:15,530
you can actually be like,
oh,

1524
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:17,230
that's good man.
That's fucking awesome.

1525
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,220
What's hard for people to be happy for 
other people?

1526
01:07:19,221 --> 01:07:24,221
If they're not happy about 100 percent,
it's very hard because no one's mean 

1527
01:07:24,221 --> 01:07:24,680
because they're in a good mood.
You know what I mean?

1528
01:07:24,681 --> 01:07:26,900
Like other people don't deserve 
happiness.

1529
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,200
You can't get it.
Yeah.

1530
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:30,310
Why the fuck did you get it?
Yeah.

1531
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:33,110
Um,
so that's like any troll.

1532
01:07:33,111 --> 01:07:35,000
It's like you just see it's because 
you're unhappy man.

1533
01:07:35,001 --> 01:07:40,001
It's like I get it.
Just don't take my success isn't your 

1534
01:07:40,001 --> 01:07:43,901
failure,
but that's how it feels because you 

1535
01:07:43,901 --> 01:07:43,901
can't do it.
You can't even get.

1536
01:07:43,901 --> 01:07:45,510
Not can.
Not only can you not do standard,

1537
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,940
whatever the thing they're mad at you 
for,

1538
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:49,970
they can't even feel what they imagine 
you feel from doing it.

1539
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:51,860
Uh,
so,

1540
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:57,310
so I tried a bunch.
The last four or five years they would 

1541
01:07:57,310 --> 01:07:57,710
work with are some side effects.
Nausea,

1542
01:07:58,290 --> 01:08:03,290
a one.
I was like gaining weight and I wasn't 

1543
01:08:03,290 --> 01:08:03,290
eating and I was gaining weight.
Um,

1544
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,550
Yeah,
it was so weird.

1545
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:09,640
I'm a shit like that.
And then the last one was um,

1546
01:08:10,910 --> 01:08:15,020
nausea and my dick was in a coma.
well,

1547
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:20,080
like literally I took a fucking pro,
the boner drug and um,

1548
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:22,620
agora.
Yeah,

1549
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:24,530
it didn't work.
But yeah,

1550
01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:26,480
generally how fucking like

1551
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,870
dan,
it was like literally,

1552
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:32,240
it's like put the bucket and chart what 
the fucking clear.

1553
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:34,530
Clear back nothing.
Wow.

1554
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:37,080
Yeah.
So you had to get off that immediately.

1555
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:38,510
Yeah.
Well the.

1556
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:39,830
Yeah.
It was so important.

1557
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:42,540
Happiness or boners?
Well,

1558
01:08:42,541 --> 01:08:44,070
what was interesting is it was,

1559
01:08:44,170 --> 01:08:49,170
it was,
it was interesting for the few months 

1560
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:51,430
that I had it to not have to worry aBout
boners boners are pursuing,

1561
01:08:51,431 --> 01:08:55,000
girls are fucking texting and,
and,

1562
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:57,820
and tendering and all that shit.
Just like I don't give a shit.

1563
01:08:58,310 --> 01:09:01,880
Wow.
Now when they seem like nice people,

1564
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:06,050
now what does it do?
Does it,

1565
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:08,840
does it somehow another deplete your 
testosterone?

1566
01:09:08,841 --> 01:09:10,550
Does it?
I don't know why that.

1567
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:11,870
The thing about antidepressants,

1568
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:15,750
they don't know why they work.
They know that they work.

1569
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:19,080
They have theories about why they work.
Like the.

1570
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,650
I was on a class of antidepressants 
called ssrs,

1571
01:09:22,651 --> 01:09:26,940
which are short for a selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitor,

1572
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:30,420
which means it's basically a double 
negative,

1573
01:09:30,510 --> 01:09:34,500
a re uptake inhibitor.
It's basically when you,

1574
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:37,290
when the,
when the serotonin goes out,

1575
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:42,420
usually it gets collected quickly,
but if you take this drug,

1576
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:44,970
it leaves the serotonin out in your 
brain longer.

1577
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:47,960
I believe sarah re uptake inhibitor.
Yeah.

1578
01:09:47,961 --> 01:09:50,970
So it gets,
it inhibits the uptake so it like,

1579
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:51,870
hey,
stay out.

1580
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:53,400
Hey,
run around a little bit,

1581
01:09:53,401 --> 01:09:54,480
you know what I mean?
Saratoga.

1582
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:56,910
So if you take,
if you take the drug,

1583
01:09:56,911 --> 01:10:01,911
I think if I,
if I didn't take the drug it would be a,

1584
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,400
I don't know,
I guess it was my brain would collect it

1585
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:07,380
super quick.
I'm of the mind that I don't have enough

1586
01:10:07,381 --> 01:10:09,060
serotonin to begin with.
Like I just have,

1587
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,940
I feel like I have a serotonin 
deficiency naturally,

1588
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:14,280
but whatever.
So uh,

1589
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:19,310
so I'm.
So my dick was in a coma and I was 

1590
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:21,290
throwing up like pretty regularly.
Like how often?

1591
01:10:21,291 --> 01:10:23,890
Like three Days a week.
Wow.

1592
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:25,890
I just be driving and go like,
oh,

1593
01:10:25,891 --> 01:10:30,720
I'm going to throw up and throw up and 
then be fine.

1594
01:10:31,110 --> 01:10:36,110
So essentially what these drugs you're 
trying to somehow or another reengineer 

1595
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:38,580
your,
your neuro chemical makeup?

1596
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:40,070
Yeah.
Yeah.

1597
01:10:40,071 --> 01:10:41,930
I mean you're trying to help it 
basically.

1598
01:10:41,931 --> 01:10:45,220
I don't think you can reengineer it.
I'll get to the reengineering,

1599
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,440
but I don't.
I think with the drugs you just go like,

1600
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:51,320
it's basically a bandaid.
It just like,

1601
01:10:51,321 --> 01:10:52,820
hey,
reroute ain't go over there.

1602
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,080
It's never like you're,
you're fucking synapses are in different

1603
01:10:57,081 --> 01:10:57,740
places.
You know what I mean?

1604
01:10:57,741 --> 01:10:58,010
It's like,

1605
01:10:58,150 --> 01:11:01,910
but it's amazing that they're doing this
and they're not exactly sure as you say,

1606
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:03,460
how they work.
Yeah.

1607
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:04,920
Yeah.
They don't.

1608
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:06,730
They really don't.
They have theory.

1609
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:12,720
Obviously they know that ssrs radio,
they selectively,

1610
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:15,960
you know,
up to the whatever fucking.

1611
01:11:16,590 --> 01:11:20,460
But they don't know exactly.
They don't even know if,

1612
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:23,790
if it'S in your brain or if it's in your
stomach,

1613
01:11:23,791 --> 01:11:26,010
there's a new thing.
There was an article in the atlantic two

1614
01:11:26,011 --> 01:11:29,160
days ago that's saying a lot of.
First of all,

1615
01:11:29,161 --> 01:11:32,130
you're all of like all those chemicals 
we talked about,

1616
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:34,590
lIke sarah tunnel and stuff.
It's mostly in your stomach.

1617
01:11:35,310 --> 01:11:36,810
Um,
which people don't know.

1618
01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:40,920
Um,
so they are basically saying like,

1619
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:41,580
they're,
they're,

1620
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:46,660
they're,
they're lookIng in people's feces and 

1621
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:50,390
they think that the amount of chemicals 
or combinations you have in your 

1622
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:50,390
stomach,
it can affect mood.

1623
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:51,560
Wow.
Yeah.

1624
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:56,800
Well,
that's what the concept behind 

1625
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:56,800
probiotics affecting the mood are 100 
percent.

1626
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:01,480
By the way.
I was getting a bunch of colds and I 

1627
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:02,850
started taking probiotics and haven't 
got one to die harm.

1628
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,610
I almost never get sick.
Yeah.

1629
01:12:04,670 --> 01:12:06,550
I drink kombucha everyday.
Yeah.

1630
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,780
I have a,
the gts kombucha,

1631
01:12:08,781 --> 01:12:12,950
the kind that you have to have an id to 
show because it is moRe than one half of

1632
01:12:12,951 --> 01:12:14,660
one percent of our.
That's all it is.

1633
01:12:14,661 --> 01:12:15,350
A tiny,
tiny.

1634
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:19,790
You'd have to drInk like 30 of them to 
catch the bus you'd get from one beer,

1635
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:21,910
but it's worth it.
Yeah.

1636
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:24,130
Um,
but uh,

1637
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,700
it's,
it's a stupid law,

1638
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:30,850
but the probiotic effect of the 
fermentation of this live cultures,

1639
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:31,980
it's causing the alcohol.
yeah.

1640
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:33,560
But it's so good for you,
man.

1641
01:12:33,561 --> 01:12:35,420
YeAh,
it's been crazy.

1642
01:12:35,510 --> 01:12:37,280
Changed my life.
Like traveling.

1643
01:12:37,281 --> 01:12:38,030
you should make me sick.

1644
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:40,010
It was always getting sick.
I don't get sick anymore.

1645
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:42,800
If I do get sick,
it's very quick in and out.

1646
01:12:42,801 --> 01:12:43,910
So quick turnaround.
Yeah.

1647
01:12:43,911 --> 01:12:46,720
I would highly recommend it because if 
you're traveling all the time on a,

1648
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:49,730
as a comIc on the road,
like your immune system takes a fucking.

1649
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:52,160
Even in firstclass gel,
it does.

1650
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:56,570
Even first class I wrote coach the other
day for the first time in a long time,

1651
01:12:57,650 --> 01:12:59,230
people were touching me,
sitting there,

1652
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:04,240
I was like,
why are you touchIng your leg is 

1653
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:04,240
touching my leg.
Whatever you get.

1654
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:04,580
It's obviously something comforting 
about that.

1655
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:07,430
Everybody's touching each other.
He's sitting there and you're,

1656
01:13:07,431 --> 01:13:12,431
you know that your arm's gonna touch the
guy next to you and everybody accepts 

1657
01:13:12,431 --> 01:13:12,431
that we're all.
This is the world we're living in.

1658
01:13:12,431 --> 01:13:13,670
Okay.
I mean,

1659
01:13:13,671 --> 01:13:18,671
why is that bad?
As long as everyone's arm is touching 

1660
01:13:18,671 --> 01:13:18,671
everyone.

1661
01:13:18,671 --> 01:13:18,671
Yeah,
I'm cool.

1662
01:13:18,671 --> 01:13:20,120
And as long as no one gets greedy with 
the,

1663
01:13:20,121 --> 01:13:22,670
as long as everyone's like,
friendly with the space,

1664
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:27,700
you know,
you don't man spread and bop into the 

1665
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:30,530
other guy's side and you know,
but also hygiene,

1666
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:35,710
that's a big one.
It's huge because if you touch them 

1667
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:35,710
people and they stink,
that's fucking brutal.

1668
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:39,350
And I've had that.
How long the flight was two flights.

1669
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:41,390
What happened was I'm to vegas or 
something.

1670
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:42,530
No,
it was to Canada.

1671
01:13:42,531 --> 01:13:45,880
I fucked up and I'm so stupid.
just donor move.

1672
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:50,960
My flight takes off.
It took off at a certain time.

1673
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:54,470
And uh,
I had it written the time I was supposed

1674
01:13:54,471 --> 01:13:56,340
to get up,
uh,

1675
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:01,400
had reversed.
So instead of thinking that I was 

1676
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:04,380
supposed to get up at 9:00
flight,

1677
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,530
the flight was at 9:00
and I was like,

1678
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,530
oh no.
Like I thought the flight was at like 11

1679
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:12,040
and I got there in the future.
I think

1680
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:15,060
you should just go based on what time of
flight leaves.

1681
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:18,010
I don't leave it up to the airline,
what time you should wake up,

1682
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:24,520
what was just such a boneheaded move.
I just had too many different things 

1683
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,850
going on and I wrote it down somewhere 
and you just incorrectly wrote it down.

1684
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:28,290
Yeah.
But anyway,

1685
01:14:28,291 --> 01:14:30,120
point being I had to switch the flights,
blah blah blah.

1686
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:35,180
And I was thinking like,
it's kinda like the only time where 

1687
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:35,760
people ever touched people that they 
don't know except jujitsu class maybe,

1688
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:37,740
you know.
And then you try to kill each other.

1689
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,260
Mass transit,
mass transit.

1690
01:14:40,261 --> 01:14:41,550
Especially like you said,
tokyo,

1691
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,680
tokyo,
rather that they push people in.

1692
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,000
They literally have guys whose jobs are 
to shove people deeper and deeper into 

1693
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:49,290
those boxes.

1694
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:51,880
Yeah,
they're made,

1695
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:53,270
they make six figures doing that.

1696
01:14:54,210 --> 01:14:56,940
People get depressed,
some people get depressed from a lack of

1697
01:14:56,941 --> 01:14:57,900
human contact.

1698
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:00,580
Absolutely.
I'll get to that in a second.

1699
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:02,410
UM,
so.

1700
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:07,620
Okay.
So I was just like taking like the last 

1701
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:07,620
one.
I was like,

1702
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:10,410
I'm so sick of fucking taking 
[inaudible] the thing with 

1703
01:15:10,410 --> 01:15:14,040
antidepressant pills is that you don't,
It's a complete guessing it what's gonna

1704
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:20,310
work for you?
Because the one I was taking that was 

1705
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:22,210
making my dick fall asleep and make me 
throw up was supposed to have the lowest

1706
01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:25,060
uh,
side effect profile of all of them.

1707
01:15:25,870 --> 01:15:30,870
But I've had ones that had more that 
were supposed to do worship shit and 

1708
01:15:30,870 --> 01:15:30,930
they didn't.
So,

1709
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:32,770
so I was like,
I'm so sick of this,

1710
01:15:32,771 --> 01:15:35,830
so I just started looking up other shit 
to do.

1711
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:37,630
Um,
and the,

1712
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:42,930
the big one that I,
that kept coming up that I saw was 

1713
01:15:42,930 --> 01:15:43,750
ketamine.
So I was like,

1714
01:15:43,751 --> 01:15:46,000
that's interesting.
Like I didn't really,

1715
01:15:46,001 --> 01:15:48,610
I knew it was like a party drug and I 
didn't really know that much about it.

1716
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,250
It's a very weird party drugs.
Yeah.

1717
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:51,670
Yeah.
I haven't done it.

1718
01:15:51,671 --> 01:15:56,671
I'm like,
why the fuck would you ever take that 

1719
01:15:56,671 --> 01:15:56,671
around people?
Um,

1720
01:15:56,671 --> 01:15:56,671
but,
so,

1721
01:15:56,890 --> 01:16:00,870
so there's a guy in santa monica,
dr stephen,

1722
01:16:00,871 --> 01:16:02,830
man dell,
and um,

1723
01:16:03,010 --> 01:16:06,280
that's a picture of me getting to talk 
about this guy on.

1724
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:07,450
I don't know.
I mean,

1725
01:16:07,451 --> 01:16:10,000
I think I can.
Yeah.

1726
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:10,570
Oh,
okay.

1727
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:11,200
Well,
I mean,

1728
01:16:11,201 --> 01:16:13,990
the guy's name he mentioned,
I don't mind if you.

1729
01:16:14,330 --> 01:16:15,280
Okay.
So,

1730
01:16:15,610 --> 01:16:16,830
uh,
so he,

1731
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:22,000
he,
he was an anesthesiologist who basically

1732
01:16:22,001 --> 01:16:25,780
came up with a Regimen for,
that's for depression and he's,

1733
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:27,070
by the way,
he's not the only one.

1734
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:32,100
Like there's,
there's probably hundreds in America 

1735
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:32,100
right now that are doIng this with 
ketamine.

1736
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:33,100
Yeah.
Whoa.

1737
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:36,950
Uh,
especially if you go on reddit or um,

1738
01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:42,330
and he liked the ending of the boards 
and any kind of like a antidepressant 

1739
01:16:42,330 --> 01:16:42,340
boards or whatever.

1740
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:47,820
Uh,
there's people that did it and there's 

1741
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:50,401
another one called tms,
which is the other one that's making a 

1742
01:16:50,401 --> 01:16:51,130
comeback is just the,
the cuckoo's nest one,

1743
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:55,480
the electrical shock therapy because 
they were doing it wrong apparently.

1744
01:16:55,990 --> 01:16:58,200
And there a way to do it now,
like you just,

1745
01:16:58,590 --> 01:16:59,210
the,
the,

1746
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:04,460
the amperage was too high.
So there was just fucking fry cooking if

1747
01:17:06,041 --> 01:17:07,240
you cook it a little bit.
Yeah,

1748
01:17:07,241 --> 01:17:08,420
exactly.
You don't want to it.

1749
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:09,740
Yeah.
Precisely.

1750
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,080
You little something steam it.
Yeah.

1751
01:17:12,081 --> 01:17:14,010
You can punch in a.
but you should throw an egg on you,

1752
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:15,610
your fucking website.
So that's,

1753
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:20,660
that's made a comeback.
And then there's another one called 

1754
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:22,340
transcranial magnetic stimulation where 
they just basically shoot magnet,

1755
01:17:22,341 --> 01:17:23,960
said your brain.
Um,

1756
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:29,260
and,
but that's five days a week for five 

1757
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:30,860
weeks.
academy kids.

1758
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:36,100
The treatment is you do six sessions in 
two weeks.

1759
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:37,600
Oh,
I'm.

1760
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,860
So it's monday,
wednesday,

1761
01:17:39,861 --> 01:17:44,861
friday of two weeks.
And I did it last week and the week 

1762
01:17:44,861 --> 01:17:47,840
before.
So first time I go in a and again,

1763
01:17:47,841 --> 01:17:49,940
I don't know if I could have researched 
it all.

1764
01:17:49,941 --> 01:17:54,941
I knew that was what then you,
when you go in you have basically when 

1765
01:17:54,941 --> 01:17:57,890
you do ketamine you have like an out of 
body sort of experienced meaning,

1766
01:17:57,891 --> 01:18:01,310
like a dissociative experience.
So which seems pretty vague.

1767
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:02,660
Um,
so I,

1768
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:07,750
so he hooks the ivy up and um,
and within 15 seconds I was like gone.

1769
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:19,030
Like at first you just get sleepy and 
then I was in the trip that you were 

1770
01:18:19,071 --> 01:18:23,270
talking about things to fucking 
geometric shapes,

1771
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:28,540
all kinds.
The thing about tripping that I forgot 

1772
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:29,340
is how good the transitions are,
is like it'll go from geometric safety,

1773
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:34,360
like a bear's face to just like just 
crazy shit for 45 minutes.

1774
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:41,800
Um,
and then you come out of it and you 

1775
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,390
slowly come out of it and you were like 
noise canceling headphones.

1776
01:18:44,391 --> 01:18:46,880
I'm just at a doctor's office,
like in a weird,

1777
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:52,120
not even weird,
like those like 19 seventies doctors' 

1778
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:55,751
offices that you see in la,
like just sort of a shitty elevator and 

1779
01:18:55,751 --> 01:18:55,870
whatever.
Um,

1780
01:18:56,510 --> 01:18:58,970
so when I came out of the first one I 
was like,

1781
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:02,240
it was rough because I didn't know it 
was going to trip like that.

1782
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:04,670
And b,
I had been,

1783
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:08,030
I didn't get a ton of sleep the night 
before and uh,

1784
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:09,980
so I was,
and I'd flown that day.

1785
01:19:09,981 --> 01:19:14,981
I was just kind of groggy and uh,
and I felt really shitty and it took me 

1786
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:17,420
like I was like,
after I was done,

1787
01:19:17,421 --> 01:19:20,570
I probably laid in the bed there for 
like an hour,

1788
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:22,850
so it was like,
I can't do shit right now.

1789
01:19:22,910 --> 01:19:24,830
Like I can't,
I could barely stand.

1790
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:30,640
So the first day was rough and uh,
and that I still felt shitty that night 

1791
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,320
and I was like,
I don't think I'm going to do it again.

1792
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:34,580
Like,
that was too rough.

1793
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:40,150
And then I woke up tuesday morning and 
felt fucking great.

1794
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:42,500
I was like,
oh,

1795
01:19:43,090 --> 01:19:44,720
um,
I got to do it again,

1796
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,360
felt great.
I felt clear.

1797
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:49,060
Here's the,
one of the ways my,

1798
01:19:49,330 --> 01:19:54,050
uh,
depression manifested itself was like,

1799
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:59,080
I felt my head felt heavy and I felt 
like I had like,

1800
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:03,730
I had like a lead weight on my forehead,
you know,

1801
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:06,050
that's the way I felt when I did 
ecstasy.

1802
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:11,360
You say after the day after I felt it 
felt amazing when I did it.

1803
01:20:11,410 --> 01:20:13,830
And that's what it is because it 
depletes.

1804
01:20:13,831 --> 01:20:15,310
Yeah.
You get all the serotonin's gun.

1805
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:20,320
Yeah.
And that's basically what people with 

1806
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,660
depression a lot of times are like just 
everyday isn't just like a headwind.

1807
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:23,760
It's not,
it's just like fucking,

1808
01:20:23,761 --> 01:20:28,761
could thIs be a little bit easier,
like I'm not asking for a miracle and 

1809
01:20:28,761 --> 01:20:30,780
just like I'm just sick of having to 
walk into the wind all the time.

1810
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:33,120
Right.
A little bit uphill into the windows.

1811
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:34,110
Fuck.
Alright.

1812
01:20:34,650 --> 01:20:39,650
So I did it again that wednesday and 
every time I did it,

1813
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:42,210
um,
the,

1814
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:43,190
the,
the other thing that,

1815
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:45,030
one of the ways that they kind of gauge 
it as,

1816
01:20:45,031 --> 01:20:48,690
do you do like a inventory,
a questionnaire,

1817
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:53,720
like a 25 question questionnaire.
Like how do you feel about your future?

1818
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:56,700
And like,
it's like not good,

1819
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:58,410
fine,
neutral,

1820
01:20:58,470 --> 01:20:59,710
whatever.
Um,

1821
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:04,320
each one has a point value.
They add it up if it's like in the teens

1822
01:21:04,321 --> 01:21:07,830
or high teens or twenties,
that means you're depressed if you're in

1823
01:21:07,831 --> 01:21:09,260
the under,
you know,

1824
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:10,770
the low teens,
you're good,

1825
01:21:10,771 --> 01:21:15,771
whatever.
And I think mine went from low twenties 

1826
01:21:15,771 --> 01:21:19,260
to like single digits in the two weeks.

1827
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:23,760
Wow.
And the only downside,

1828
01:21:23,761 --> 01:21:28,761
and I can't get it like perfectly clear 
read because I'm quitting the ssri when 

1829
01:21:29,191 --> 01:21:29,480
the,
the,

1830
01:21:29,481 --> 01:21:30,690
the one that,
the deq killer,

1831
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:34,200
I'm quitting that at the same time.
so I'm just like,

1832
01:21:34,230 --> 01:21:39,230
that's,
I'm sort of having withdrawal from that 

1833
01:21:39,230 --> 01:21:39,230
and the way it was manifesting itself 
for a couple of weeks was like,

1834
01:21:39,230 --> 01:21:44,181
I just felt like shit.
I just felt like I had the flu but not 

1835
01:21:44,181 --> 01:21:44,181
coughing or sneezing.
Just like rundown.

1836
01:21:44,181 --> 01:21:48,950
When you wean yourself off of an ssri,
is there a protocol for doing that?

1837
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:51,240
This paper,
that's all you can do.

1838
01:21:51,330 --> 01:21:54,410
And whEn they say taper,
like you have like x,

1839
01:21:54,430 --> 01:21:56,310
do you get smaller pills?
Dei.

1840
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:59,100
You just clip them in half and that's 
what I did.

1841
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:02,010
And you take less of them?
Yeah.

1842
01:22:02,011 --> 01:22:05,130
You just do you go?
I was on 21 to 10.

1843
01:22:05,131 --> 01:22:05,950
One to five nomad.

1844
01:22:05,970 --> 01:22:08,190
Zero.
And in how long you've been at zero?

1845
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:11,880
I don't know.
I think three or four weeks.

1846
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:13,770
So how do you feel?
Right now?

1847
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:18,980
I feel I feel better every day from the,
from the ssri effect has gotten better 

1848
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:21,120
every day.
I feel like I don't feel nauseous,

1849
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,260
I'm not nauseous,
just like,

1850
01:22:22,261 --> 01:22:27,261
I don't feel like shit.
The onlY way it's kind of manifesting 

1851
01:22:27,261 --> 01:22:28,830
itself now is like,
one of my eyes is a little flight.

1852
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:31,500
Feels like I have something in it.
Just the gay.

1853
01:22:31,501 --> 01:22:34,200
I got it.
J and j guy.

1854
01:22:34,590 --> 01:22:35,370
Um,
what it is.

1855
01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:36,240
Uh,
yeah.

1856
01:22:36,241 --> 01:22:40,740
So one of my eyes feels a little gay,
so as he was,

1857
01:22:40,741 --> 01:22:42,380
there's no other word for it.
Um,

1858
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:45,180
so I just put eyedrops in.
That's it.

1859
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:47,820
Yeah.
And it might be unrelated.

1860
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:50,460
The eyeball thing that I think it's 
related because I've looked it up.

1861
01:22:51,150 --> 01:22:51,840
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1862
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:52,950
There's like,
there's,

1863
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:58,020
you know,
ssri withdrawal if you just google that 

1864
01:22:58,020 --> 01:22:58,020
and they have eyeballs issues.
Yeah.

1865
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:00,140
It's like you'll be a little cloudy,
huh?

1866
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:02,580
Some people,
it usually lasts like three weeks.

1867
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,560
Some people.
I've seen guys on reddit that were like,

1868
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:08,170
I fucking had this for six months.
Jesus,

1869
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,150
which would make me crazy,
I think.

1870
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:11,770
Yeah.
How could you not be?

1871
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:14,170
So let me ask You this,
so you,

1872
01:23:14,171 --> 01:23:17,200
you take it the first time and how many 
days afterwards did you feel great?

1873
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:18,610
You said two,
one,

1874
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:22,000
one day the next day feel like shit 
after it's over.

1875
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:27,330
Felt like shit the after it was over,
felt like basically went home and just 

1876
01:23:27,330 --> 01:23:28,450
laid in my,
on my account.

1877
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,970
Did you feel like physically worn out?
Like

1878
01:23:31,290 --> 01:23:34,360
I just felt like,
um,

1879
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:37,320
I guess like I had a high fever,
you know,

1880
01:23:37,321 --> 01:23:39,420
that feeling.
It's just like I can't do shit.

1881
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:44,170
Was it possible that it was the stress 
of the experience?

1882
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:44,770
Because you didn't know?

1883
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:46,150
Possibly.
Yeah,

1884
01:23:46,151 --> 01:23:49,270
because you ever haD anesthesia.
You don't want to come out of it.

1885
01:23:50,050 --> 01:23:52,840
It feels that's like my least favorite 
feeling in the world.

1886
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:56,200
That's basically what it was that 
feeling of like,

1887
01:23:56,260 --> 01:23:58,630
oh fuck.
Like I could throw up.

1888
01:23:58,631 --> 01:23:59,350
I'm not gonna.

1889
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:04,860
So it could be a bunch of issues.
Do you have the same feeling every time 

1890
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:04,860
he did it?

1891
01:24:05,370 --> 01:24:10,370
Yeah.
Basically I would need to take a nap 

1892
01:24:10,370 --> 01:24:10,420
every time.
Yeah.

1893
01:24:11,010 --> 01:24:16,010
Um,
because basically when I did it on the 

1894
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:19,050
wednesday,
I took a nap and did a spot that night.

1895
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:20,550
Wow.
Yeah.

1896
01:24:20,790 --> 01:24:22,470
Um,
I ran into that night.

1897
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,660
We talked about,
it was at the improv.

1898
01:24:24,661 --> 01:24:29,010
Maybe my ran into you at the store and 
you told me the last treatment that day.

1899
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:30,210
Yeah,
but that was friday.

1900
01:24:30,450 --> 01:24:33,010
It was like a less than a week ago.
Yeah,

1901
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:35,300
I'm okay.
It's different time that end,

1902
01:24:35,301 --> 01:24:38,940
that friday because I had done it 
enough,

1903
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:44,180
but what I found,
what was interesting was every session 

1904
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:44,970
it would take me longer to go into the 
trip,

1905
01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:46,950
meaning like my body was getting used 
to.

1906
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:50,010
It was building up a tolerance for it,
for the ketamine.

1907
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:54,240
How long haS it's all ivy ivy based.
The first time,

1908
01:24:54,241 --> 01:24:59,241
like I said,
20 seconds and the last time was 

1909
01:24:59,241 --> 01:25:03,411
probably four or five minutes.
Oh yeah.

1910
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,780
And he was upping The dose I think.
Wow.

1911
01:25:06,781 --> 01:25:07,770
I'm so

1912
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:11,380
well I ran into after the first time you
did it and I ran into you.

1913
01:25:11,381 --> 01:25:13,900
I think friday was after the last time 
you did it.

1914
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:19,040
Yeah.
And unfortunately we didn't have a 

1915
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:21,181
chance to talk much until now,
so I couldn't like get an objective 

1916
01:25:21,181 --> 01:25:21,181
sense of how you seemed.

1917
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:25,140
Yeah.
What was Interesting was like the friday

1918
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:30,980
of the first week I had,
it might have been friday or saturday,

1919
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:36,320
but there was a thing that was happening
to me on stage where I was for like 

1920
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:36,320
months.
I felt shitty.

1921
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:36,320
You know,
when you feel shitty,

1922
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:40,830
you can't kill that hard.
Like there's basically a cap.

1923
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:46,160
I had a cap on my sets for months and it
was making me fucking crazy because it 

1924
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,040
was like eighth.
Not me,

1925
01:25:47,070 --> 01:25:52,070
like it's my,
it's a this fucking eighth depRession 

1926
01:25:52,070 --> 01:25:55,140
beats the ssrs and now it's the ssrs and
the a ketamine,

1927
01:25:55,680 --> 01:26:00,390
but I on the friday or saturday I 
fucking murdered in the main room,

1928
01:26:00,450 --> 01:26:04,610
which you know,
is like a but it because I was clear.

1929
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,500
Do you know what I mean?
Like I was finallY like,

1930
01:26:06,530 --> 01:26:08,990
oh,
I know the audience wouldn't feel like a

1931
01:26:08,991 --> 01:26:12,470
slugginess to me.
There was like a real,

1932
01:26:12,471 --> 01:26:13,700
like,
you know,

1933
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:17,060
more of just like a laser focus.
Yeah,

1934
01:26:17,190 --> 01:26:18,180
on point.
Yeah.

1935
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:20,490
Yeah man.
I've had nights Where I'm tired.

1936
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:25,850
That is the worst god damn feelIng when 
you're exhausted and trying to come up 

1937
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:29,061
with energy to go on stage when you're 
physically our bodies physically 

1938
01:26:29,061 --> 01:26:29,061
exhausted.
Yeah.

1939
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:32,890
So you were kind of battling that a lot 
and so then you're taking it

1940
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:37,570
affects writing to machine depressed.
Like I haven't written.

1941
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:42,900
I've,
I thiNk I've got basically two an hour 

1942
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:45,031
but it took me like two years.
Like it wasn't like I'm not like you 

1943
01:26:45,031 --> 01:26:45,700
where I can take a couple months and 
just come with the newer bernie.

1944
01:26:45,701 --> 01:26:49,750
These guys like first of all,
I think it would take me longer than six

1945
01:26:49,751 --> 01:26:52,000
months anyway,
but it was in part of it.

1946
01:26:52,001 --> 01:26:55,750
I wanted to go like I'm,
my fucking brain isn't working because I

1947
01:26:55,751 --> 01:26:58,450
just run out of options in terms of ssri
and shit.

1948
01:26:58,450 --> 01:27:00,630
So I'm also,
that's a primary focus of your mind.

1949
01:27:00,631 --> 01:27:02,290
It's like how do,
how the fuck do I get happy?

1950
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:04,480
You're trying to million different 
medications,

1951
01:27:04,481 --> 01:27:07,870
all these different ideas and like it's 
just frustrating.

1952
01:27:07,871 --> 01:27:08,740
So.
Okay.

1953
01:27:08,741 --> 01:27:12,550
So you do it the first time and then the
next day you feel great.

1954
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:16,710
You are still on the ssri or your 
window?

1955
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:21,750
I was done.
I mean i'vE done now withdrawing off of 

1956
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:23,290
them because this is something that is a
big issue with iowasca.

1957
01:27:23,770 --> 01:27:24,500
No,
the I say,

1958
01:27:24,650 --> 01:27:26,750
look,
I'm talking to john bosco.

1959
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:31,390
Oh,
you take iowasca guilt die,

1960
01:27:31,391 --> 01:27:31,900
right?
Well,

1961
01:27:31,901 --> 01:27:36,901
it's very dangerous.
Ssri or dangerous with iowasca with 

1962
01:27:36,901 --> 01:27:40,741
dimethyltryptamine,
with in mushrooms are very closely 

1963
01:27:40,741 --> 01:27:42,300
related to d to dimethyltryptamine.
Yeah.

1964
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:47,760
There's people that take mushrooms and 
they also are taking an ssri and I've 

1965
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:48,280
heard that.
That's kind of funky too.

1966
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:50,410
I'm trying to think if I've ever done 
that.

1967
01:27:50,530 --> 01:27:53,440
Ari was on ssri I think,
and he was taking mushrooms,

1968
01:27:53,441 --> 01:27:55,810
so I think I've done that.
Maybe he was on a different kind of.

1969
01:27:55,811 --> 01:27:59,170
I think I've met a pagan ssri.
I know for a fact are.

1970
01:27:59,171 --> 01:28:02,890
He did ask his doctor and told him and 
apparently the type of medication he was

1971
01:28:02,891 --> 01:28:04,360
on,
it was fine with nordstrom's.

1972
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:07,590
The ta,
I think I did it once or twice on ssr is

1973
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:12,640
fine,
which really dangerous apparently is if 

1974
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:16,051
you take a prescription mao inhibitor 
and then you take mushrooms or you take 

1975
01:28:16,331 --> 01:28:18,480
iowasca,
then it's super fucking devic.

1976
01:28:18,550 --> 01:28:18,990
Mio.

1977
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:24,590
Mao inhibitors have a big profile which 
like don't take it to the other shit 

1978
01:28:24,930 --> 01:28:29,930
that has more.
That's on more warning for the most 

1979
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:29,930
thing.
Yeah,

1980
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:29,930
I,
I,

1981
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:31,410
I believe I've read this.
I'm like 98 percent sure I read this.

1982
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:34,050
Most people.
Oh,

1983
01:28:34,051 --> 01:28:35,250
I did read it.
It was a,

1984
01:28:35,251 --> 01:28:37,350
this guy Carl Hart,
who'd be a great guest.

1985
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:38,280
Adam.
Oh,

1986
01:28:38,281 --> 01:28:38,910
alright,
there you go.

1987
01:28:39,510 --> 01:28:44,510
That guy's fucking awesome.
I'm said that most people that die of 

1988
01:28:44,510 --> 01:28:48,681
heroin overdoses are drunk like the,
the most of the overdoses are because 

1989
01:28:49,261 --> 01:28:51,030
they combined it with alcohol.
That makes sense.

1990
01:28:51,090 --> 01:28:51,270
Yeah.

1991
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:54,190
He was on o'reilly the other day and I 
texted him.

1992
01:28:54,610 --> 01:28:56,740
I was like,
how the fuck do you do that?

1993
01:28:57,010 --> 01:28:59,460
Like you talked for five seconds and 
he's touching you,

1994
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:04,760
and then they caught away him for a 
breaking news report on the lady getting

1995
01:29:05,101 --> 01:29:07,920
arraigned and upstate New York for 
helping the prisoners escape.

1996
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:11,100
There's a panel,
there's him and a bunch of other people.

1997
01:29:11,101 --> 01:29:13,740
They're all talking about drugs and he 
barely got a chance to talk.

1998
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,460
It's also like,
what good does that shit too.

1999
01:29:16,510 --> 01:29:18,210
That's what I always wonder.
Like when they go,

2000
01:29:18,211 --> 01:29:19,950
hey,
you want to come on a panel on cnn?

2001
01:29:19,951 --> 01:29:20,760
I'm like,
no,

2002
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:24,110
I'm not going to change any minds.
And it's also shitty way of community.

2003
01:29:24,111 --> 01:29:24,810
Yeah,
exactly.

2004
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:26,940
This is the way to communicate.
Yes.

2005
01:29:27,150 --> 01:29:31,980
This is the best way in woodland hills.
Hit it off as part.

2006
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:32,850
Yeah.
That's shitty.

2007
01:29:32,851 --> 01:29:35,070
Office park.
This is the way to do it,

2008
01:29:35,071 --> 01:29:35,960
right?
Under lighting.

2009
01:29:36,570 --> 01:29:41,570
So you.
So you go and you do it the first time 

2010
01:29:41,570 --> 01:29:44,490
that day afterwards,
you start to feel better in the way.

2011
01:29:45,020 --> 01:29:50,020
Uh,
I would compare the trip in and of 

2012
01:29:50,020 --> 01:29:51,450
itself the actual trip like lsd,

2013
01:29:51,850 --> 01:29:53,590
lsd,
but ellis without the speed.

2014
01:29:53,710 --> 01:29:56,500
But with a lot of visuals though.
All visuals.

2015
01:29:56,670 --> 01:29:57,590
All visual.
Yeah.

2016
01:29:57,790 --> 01:30:00,780
Crazy.
the way mckenna described ketamine,

2017
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:02,520
I've never done ketamine the way,
um,

2018
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:07,830
you know,
makenna and john lilly was a huge 

2019
01:30:07,830 --> 01:30:07,830
pioneer of ketamine,
you know,

2020
01:30:07,830 --> 01:30:12,430
gun.
John lilly's the guy who invented the 

2021
01:30:12,430 --> 01:30:13,741
isolation tank,
one of his things that he used to like 

2022
01:30:13,741 --> 01:30:14,840
to do is shoot ketamine in a muscularly,
intramuscularly,

2023
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:18,160
shove it right into his fucking muscle.
I think that's what I did.

2024
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:23,220
I mean you did it,
but the intramuscular is a slower 

2025
01:30:23,220 --> 01:30:26,881
release and apparent last for hours and 
he would bang whack himself and climate 

2026
01:30:26,981 --> 01:30:31,981
of the tank and be gone for a fun day.
Just zoom around crazy and mckenna 

2027
01:30:31,981 --> 01:30:36,721
described it like he.
This is a very interesting way of 

2028
01:30:36,721 --> 01:30:40,350
describing psychedelics.
He believed whether or not I was to 

2029
01:30:40,350 --> 01:30:43,671
correct it,
but he believed that every psychedelic 

2030
01:30:43,671 --> 01:30:43,800
you take your.

2031
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:48,830
You're experiencing not just your trip,
but the trip of all the people who've 

2032
01:30:48,830 --> 01:30:51,190
ever tripped on that psychedelic.
So when you're taking mushrooms,

2033
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:53,920
you're not just experiencing the 
mushroom,

2034
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:59,100
you're experiencing the mushroom as it 
has interfaced with countless human 

2035
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:00,070
beings,
all throughout humanity,

2036
01:31:00,071 --> 01:31:05,071
all the different people have taken the 
mushrooms and had these beautiful 

2037
01:31:05,071 --> 01:31:08,011
experiences.
You experienced those experiences as 

2038
01:31:08,011 --> 01:31:08,011
well.
It's.

2039
01:31:08,011 --> 01:31:08,011
Yeah,
but I,

2040
01:31:08,011 --> 01:31:08,470
I don't,
I don't disagree.

2041
01:31:08,471 --> 01:31:10,750
I don't agree with that because I can't 
put it seems like.

2042
01:31:10,751 --> 01:31:11,680
Yeah,
that's possible,

2043
01:31:11,830 --> 01:31:16,830
but what he said about ketamine was he 
felt like ketamine was a new drug and 

2044
01:31:16,830 --> 01:31:20,621
these felt like when he took ketamine 
that he was in a giant office building 

2045
01:31:20,621 --> 01:31:23,200
that was empty.
It's like a vacant office building.

2046
01:31:23,410 --> 01:31:28,410
He's like,
he would walk around and there was no 

2047
01:31:28,410 --> 01:31:28,410
one there who would like look around.
There was cubicles,

2048
01:31:28,410 --> 01:31:30,400
there was lights,
there was this big open spaces,

2049
01:31:30,401 --> 01:31:35,401
but there was no one in the room.
it was just devoid of the kind of 

2050
01:31:35,401 --> 01:31:37,840
experience that you have when you take 
other sorts of psychedelics.

2051
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:39,320
Did you expire within

2052
01:31:39,850 --> 01:31:44,850
the things that.
I remember one of the things I remember 

2053
01:31:44,850 --> 01:31:47,430
was like getting.
I would start on me and then just pull 

2054
01:31:47,430 --> 01:31:48,330
out wide,
like a,

2055
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:53,420
for lack of a better example,
like google maps or in my head it was 

2056
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:53,460
more like,
um,

2057
01:31:53,790 --> 01:31:58,040
grand theft auto and like where I am,
uh,

2058
01:31:58,120 --> 01:31:59,320
there's the,
the,

2059
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,350
the,
I'm in santa monica and I just go,

2060
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:02,710
there's California,
there's whatever.

2061
01:32:02,711 --> 01:32:03,780
like,
um,

2062
01:32:04,390 --> 01:32:08,800
I was aware of every sort of your whole 
experience of people that I went to high

2063
01:32:08,801 --> 01:32:12,510
school with people that I know now,
like just every woman's sort of,

2064
01:32:12,790 --> 01:32:15,460
they're not like actually,
but sort of,

2065
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:16,900
you know,
I think about them.

2066
01:32:17,310 --> 01:32:22,310
Um,
and then it was like I was in the matrix

2067
01:32:22,781 --> 01:32:25,750
is too simplistic.
But you,

2068
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:28,630
did you see the new,
uh,

2069
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:33,660
lAnded the last perhaps will pharrel 
there's just a weird black void scene.

2070
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:38,740
Like it's like basically a black void 
with like a tron floor.

2071
01:32:39,450 --> 01:32:41,500
Um,
this was like a,

2072
01:32:42,030 --> 01:32:43,050
it was,
it was,

2073
01:32:43,090 --> 01:32:45,280
there was no tron floor,
like the,

2074
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:46,930
the,
it was a white sort of,

2075
01:32:46,931 --> 01:32:49,450
it was more of a disco floor actually 
then have white.

2076
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:54,780
This was,
I didn't have the disco floor but I did 

2077
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:56,611
have the sort of black void and then 
shit would form out of that and it was 

2078
01:32:56,611 --> 01:33:01,201
sort of lit the,
like it was like the fill lighting as 

2079
01:33:01,201 --> 01:33:05,031
they call it would be green.
so like the way your walls red it would 

2080
01:33:05,031 --> 01:33:05,530
be great.
Um,

2081
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:08,060
so,
and it was a very,

2082
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:11,360
he just made a great.
I'm back there.

2083
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:16,900
So the trip was pleasant,
it was never like,

2084
01:33:16,901 --> 01:33:18,310
I've never freaked out.
I never.

2085
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:23,760
Did you experience at entities,
does anything that you were 

2086
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:24,310
communicating with you,
there was all just shapes?

2087
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:25,750
Yeah,
it was all shapes.

2088
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:30,900
So it was just shapes and feelings,
like shapes and like I would think of 

2089
01:33:30,971 --> 01:33:35,971
stuff.
And when you say you would think of 

2090
01:33:35,971 --> 01:33:38,161
stuff,
was the stuff that you would think of 

2091
01:33:38,161 --> 01:33:38,610
related to depression?
Was it related to that?

2092
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:41,590
Because what I'm trying to do right,
you know what I mean?

2093
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:47,040
Um,
so like what kind of stuff was going 

2094
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:47,040
through your head while you're having 
this?

2095
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:47,040
Like about it,

2096
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:50,900
like love and fucking like the time I 
went in the hulk music on,

2097
01:33:51,650 --> 01:33:54,900
into anytime someone starts the time I 
did the,

2098
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:59,960
the float labs thing made me get a dog 
because I went to float labs and I 

2099
01:34:00,701 --> 01:34:04,710
floated and I was in the middle of like,
I got you got to love something man.

2100
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:06,960
And I got it up.
Um,

2101
01:34:07,530 --> 01:34:12,530
the uh,
and that dog has been the bane of my 

2102
01:34:12,530 --> 01:34:13,050
existence.
I'm getting that dog has bit more people

2103
01:34:14,310 --> 01:34:16,630
talk to you for sending me the pills.
Old ladies.

2104
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:18,150
So,
uh,

2105
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:19,950
so.
So yeah,

2106
01:34:19,951 --> 01:34:21,480
I thought about life,
just think about it,

2107
01:34:21,481 --> 01:34:24,000
but it wasn't that much.
It wasn't,

2108
01:34:24,001 --> 01:34:24,810
it was more.
Yeah.

2109
01:34:24,870 --> 01:34:29,870
I thought about like,
what if there's an earthquake also like 

2110
01:34:29,870 --> 01:34:32,700
fucking if you're,
if you're tripping on,

2111
01:34:32,790 --> 01:34:35,190
on like ketamine,
you're gone.

2112
01:34:35,570 --> 01:34:36,780
I'm,
my eyes are closed.

2113
01:34:36,781 --> 01:34:41,781
I couldn't open them.
Like I wouldn't physically been able to 

2114
01:34:41,781 --> 01:34:44,961
open them.
I'm obviously what if there's an 

2115
01:34:44,961 --> 01:34:44,961
earthquake,
but then I just feel like,

2116
01:34:45,010 --> 01:34:47,530
wow,
what a weird thing to focus on.

2117
01:34:47,531 --> 01:34:50,790
So you try to sell it to my.
It would just come into my like,

2118
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:52,150
don't you get that when you're on weed 
though?

2119
01:34:52,151 --> 01:34:53,980
sometimes I don't do weed.
Oh that's right.

2120
01:34:54,930 --> 01:34:59,600
We will let you consider all the 
possible fuckups that could go wrong.

2121
01:34:59,630 --> 01:35:01,040
even the earthquake,
I was like,

2122
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:02,870
man,
I get demolished till you die.

2123
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:05,270
Everybody's going to die.
It felt like more of like a.

2124
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:10,390
It was like,
it was going to be like the san andreas 

2125
01:35:10,390 --> 01:35:10,390
and the rock would not say,
well,

2126
01:35:10,390 --> 01:35:13,490
what would they think about that?
When it comes to psychedelic experiences

2127
01:35:13,491 --> 01:35:18,491
is like,
it's your thing about psychedelic 

2128
01:35:18,491 --> 01:35:20,950
experiences that's universal is the 
eagle dissolving properties of it and 

2129
01:35:20,950 --> 01:35:24,341
they think that a lot of this wood,
that feeling is when you're trying to,

2130
01:35:25,190 --> 01:35:30,190
you know,
to try to think about all the things 

2131
01:35:30,190 --> 01:35:31,731
that go wrong,
it's almost your ego not wanting to let 

2132
01:35:31,731 --> 01:35:31,731
go.
So like,

2133
01:35:31,731 --> 01:35:35,701
hey,
you need the man because one of the 

2134
01:35:35,701 --> 01:35:35,701
flood and earthquake happens,
or what if you know,

2135
01:35:35,701 --> 01:35:39,180
what if something's happening right now?
What if someone's breaking into your 

2136
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:39,560
car?
What about the paranoia and the fear?

2137
01:35:39,860 --> 01:35:42,230
The survival instinct as a part of the 
ego.

2138
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:43,220
It felt like

2139
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:47,670
I was backstage in my brain.
That makes sense,

2140
01:35:48,030 --> 01:35:51,310
huh?
Like I was seeing the mechanations I was

2141
01:35:51,311 --> 01:35:56,311
feeling,
but I'd also like see the see like how 

2142
01:35:56,311 --> 01:35:56,311
it got there.

2143
01:35:56,311 --> 01:35:57,570
So you can see the wiring.
Yeah,

2144
01:35:57,680 --> 01:35:59,510
that's what I always feel like when I 
do.

2145
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:01,280
When I did lsd,
am I.

2146
01:36:01,310 --> 01:36:03,230
When I,
when I did the ketamine,

2147
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:04,010
I was like,
oh,

2148
01:36:04,011 --> 01:36:06,290
it feels like you're.
It feels like my brain.

2149
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:09,020
I feel like I'm like getting a tour of 
my brain.

2150
01:36:09,170 --> 01:36:14,170
So what supposed to be the mechanism for
repair or for and another thing that 

2151
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:15,690
they don't know

2152
01:36:15,820 --> 01:36:20,820
really know they don't know,
but I can tell you that it worked like 

2153
01:36:25,590 --> 01:36:29,440
[inaudible].
I felt I felt better every day.

2154
01:36:30,010 --> 01:36:35,010
It has to do with the ssrs for sure.
But I Also feel like the thing that's 

2155
01:36:35,010 --> 01:36:36,700
been,
I've been noticing is,

2156
01:36:37,420 --> 01:36:40,930
and thIs is such a weird symptom of 
improvement,

2157
01:36:41,410 --> 01:36:46,410
I've been laughing at my own jokes more,
which sounds like it's fucking.

2158
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:47,950
Oh,
so you're an egomaniac.

2159
01:36:48,190 --> 01:36:53,190
No,
I'm just enjoying the idea as like an 

2160
01:36:53,441 --> 01:36:55,060
independent thing,
right?

2161
01:36:55,090 --> 01:37:00,090
Like I'm having fun like me and this 
person are playing for lack of a better 

2162
01:37:00,090 --> 01:37:00,090
word.
LIke we're just fucking around,

2163
01:37:00,090 --> 01:37:01,060
like,
like.

2164
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:05,540
So that to me is a symptom of feeling 
better and I also physical

2165
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:07,760
please feel better.
Wow.

2166
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:10,370
Okay.
So the first one makes you feel better.

2167
01:37:10,460 --> 01:37:12,350
Is there an increase every time you do 
it?

2168
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:15,140
Two through six.
He didn't tell me.

2169
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:17,210
I,
I'm betting there was.

2170
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:19,660
You mean an increase in dosage?
I'm at an eight.

2171
01:37:20,820 --> 01:37:21,810
Oh yeah,
yeah,

2172
01:37:21,811 --> 01:37:22,440
yeah,
for sure.

2173
01:37:22,470 --> 01:37:27,470
Because I feel it would take me longer 
to get into the trip and then the 

2174
01:37:27,470 --> 01:37:30,660
hangover would be way less.
Like I think last friday I didn't take a

2175
01:37:30,661 --> 01:37:31,970
nap.
Wow.

2176
01:37:32,050 --> 01:37:37,050
Uh,
in fact I know it didn't take a nap 

2177
01:37:37,050 --> 01:37:37,080
cause I got it at four and I had like an
eight,

2178
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:39,270
15.
So I did.

2179
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:44,300
I was tripping from 4:15
to five and then figured out how to go 

2180
01:37:45,570 --> 01:37:48,060
and had a good set.
Wow.

2181
01:37:48,270 --> 01:37:48,570
yeah.

2182
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:54,560
So is this something that you're going 
to have to repeat or is it supposed to 

2183
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:55,830
be like you whack it out and point?
Uh,

2184
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:56,460
the,

2185
01:37:56,550 --> 01:37:58,380
the,
how long it lasts is,

2186
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:00,210
is you know,
various.

2187
01:38:00,450 --> 01:38:04,590
Um,
he said it could be few weeks,

2188
01:38:04,591 --> 01:38:07,020
can be a few months.
He did tell me,

2189
01:38:07,021 --> 01:38:12,021
he said this will,
these are the things that will make it 

2190
01:38:12,021 --> 01:38:12,021
last longer.
Diet,

2191
01:38:12,021 --> 01:38:12,330
exercise,
obvious sleep.

2192
01:38:12,630 --> 01:38:17,160
He said to sleep with the sun.
It's like let wake up early if you can.

2193
01:38:17,161 --> 01:38:19,380
Like.
And another doctor told me that like,

2194
01:38:19,381 --> 01:38:22,260
more serotonin is produced early in the 
day than,

2195
01:38:22,261 --> 01:38:23,370
uh,
than late.

2196
01:38:23,990 --> 01:38:26,590
So after the job is probabLy to wake 
early to rise.

2197
01:38:26,620 --> 01:38:28,480
Yeah,
that's basically like,

2198
01:38:28,510 --> 01:38:31,460
that's better for your mental health.
Keeps him helped.

2199
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:33,860
Um,
so.

2200
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:36,370
So yeah,
if like going to bed,

2201
01:38:36,460 --> 01:38:38,020
what are you trying to wake up at?
Seven or eight.

2202
01:38:38,110 --> 01:38:39,250
But how are you going to go to bed 
early?

2203
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,840
You're a comic.
I haven't yet.

2204
01:38:41,010 --> 01:38:42,500
That's not going to work,
right?

2205
01:38:42,710 --> 01:38:44,010
Just going to be tired all the time.
no,

2206
01:38:44,020 --> 01:38:46,210
but I can go to bed.
They're weeks,

2207
01:38:46,210 --> 01:38:48,170
days during the week I go to bed at 
midnight or one.

2208
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:53,340
I do feel like there's ideas that are 
available to you when you wake up early 

2209
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:54,370
in the morning that aren't available to 
you at any other time of the day.

2210
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:59,660
Like yeah,
sometimes I forced myself to get up 

2211
01:38:59,660 --> 01:39:01,860
early in the morning just to sit down 
and write because I think sometimes I 

2212
01:39:01,860 --> 01:39:02,260
forced myself awake.

2213
01:39:02,290 --> 01:39:06,100
Like I'll set my alarm for six and then 
I'll get up and I'll sit in front of the

2214
01:39:06,101 --> 01:39:11,101
computer at 6:30
AM all cloudy I'd but then somewhere on 

2215
01:39:11,101 --> 01:39:11,290
like six,
26,

2216
01:39:11,291 --> 01:39:16,291
45,
six slash 15 slash 20 minutes later I 

2217
01:39:16,291 --> 01:39:16,291
start getting ideas.
Yeah.

2218
01:39:16,291 --> 01:39:17,860
And then they start coming out and then 
there's like,

2219
01:39:17,861 --> 01:39:22,861
this is initial wake up and then the 
coffee hits in and is initial wakeup 

2220
01:39:22,861 --> 01:39:26,881
ideas I think are almost different 
because they're really connected to the 

2221
01:39:26,881 --> 01:39:30,211
sleep world.
You were just sleeping just a small 

2222
01:39:30,211 --> 01:39:32,350
amount of time ago and you can't.
You don't have defenses at that point.

2223
01:39:32,860 --> 01:39:34,300
You can't be like stupid.
You're just like,

2224
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:39,320
oh yeah,
well that's one of the reasons why 

2225
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:39,320
people like write like writing really 
silly shit late at night.

2226
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:44,580
Like the news radio writers,
they didn't even start working until 

2227
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:44,580
like 2:00
in the morning.

2228
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:44,580
I think that was mostly paul.

2229
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:45,930
Yeah,
paul,

2230
01:39:46,010 --> 01:39:47,950
it was.
Paul had been in his twenties and it was

2231
01:39:47,951 --> 01:39:52,951
also a method to his madness.
Like paul knew what he was doing and 

2232
01:39:52,951 --> 01:39:54,760
they would write the silliest shit cause
they were barely awake.

2233
01:39:54,790 --> 01:39:57,940
They were just like laughing.
And I'd always heard that that show,

2234
01:39:57,941 --> 01:40:00,110
they just play video games.
That's mostly what the writers,

2235
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:05,200
they got me addicted.
They had a local area network set up 

2236
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:09,061
with computers playing quake on them and
you would go there and we'd all played 

2237
01:40:09,061 --> 01:40:09,070
real time against each other and talk 
shit,

2238
01:40:09,090 --> 01:40:11,710
laugh and oh my god,
it was so addictive.

2239
01:40:12,110 --> 01:40:13,390
I liked being up.
That's the thing.

2240
01:40:13,391 --> 01:40:15,550
It's not like I don't like getting up,
but I like being a right,

2241
01:40:15,551 --> 01:40:18,260
getting up as the hard part.
forcing yourself to get up out of bed.

2242
01:40:18,590 --> 01:40:20,720
You know what?
I have a thing on my phone that's really

2243
01:40:20,721 --> 01:40:24,050
funny and like it's either for you or 
not.

2244
01:40:24,051 --> 01:40:25,280
It's called.
It's an app called.

2245
01:40:25,281 --> 01:40:27,260
I can't wake up.
Right,

2246
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:29,030
okay.
It's an alarm clock.

2247
01:40:29,330 --> 01:40:32,300
It goes off it like plays,
music or whatever,

2248
01:40:32,301 --> 01:40:33,710
chime or vibrates,
whatever.

2249
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:39,410
In order to turn it off,
you have to basically enter a code,

2250
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:45,350
so it's like a 25 or 30 character code 
caps numbers.

2251
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:48,770
Lower case takes fucking 55 seconds

2252
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,960
and by the time you're done you're like,
fucking,

2253
01:40:52,970 --> 01:40:54,220
I'm up.
Oh my god.

2254
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:59,220
If you're doing that next to a girl,
if you're dating a girl and she doesn't 

2255
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:02,000
have to get up,
she'd be so mad at you fucking asshole.

2256
01:41:02,001 --> 01:41:05,790
He just out of the battery.
Yeah,

2257
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:07,840
that's,
it's really funny.

2258
01:41:07,841 --> 01:41:08,590
And it works.
Actually.

2259
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:11,140
I have no problem getting up.
I don't like it,

2260
01:41:11,141 --> 01:41:12,340
but I do it.
Yeah.

2261
01:41:12,370 --> 01:41:15,430
But I've,
I grew up getting up every day because I

2262
01:41:15,431 --> 01:41:20,350
had a paper route for the time.
I Was like 17 till I was like 21,

2263
01:41:21,010 --> 01:41:24,330
maybe even 22.
Kept it until um,

2264
01:41:24,331 --> 01:41:27,160
so I guess I'm used to just get up,
get up,

2265
01:41:27,970 --> 01:41:30,010
get up,
get the other.

2266
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:31,690
So diet,
exercise,

2267
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:34,150
get them with the sun.
and um,

2268
01:41:34,990 --> 01:41:37,780
it was interesting.
Was at the fair talk therapy.

2269
01:41:38,230 --> 01:41:40,420
Fun.
Do you have a thing with therapy?

2270
01:41:40,421 --> 01:41:43,030
I got so sick of talking.
I was like,

2271
01:41:43,090 --> 01:41:46,420
I need a physical cure.
Like I know what the problems are.

2272
01:41:46,890 --> 01:41:47,630
I,
I,

2273
01:41:47,910 --> 01:41:49,920
it's not making me feel better.
Like I,

2274
01:41:49,930 --> 01:41:51,940
it's a,
it's a fucking physical issue.

2275
01:41:51,941 --> 01:41:53,890
I can,
I promise you because that's pretty much

2276
01:41:53,891 --> 01:41:54,880
been established,
right?

2277
01:41:54,990 --> 01:41:59,990
I mean it's pretty much established that
are large majority of people or a large 

2278
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:03,230
number of people that have depression.
There iS a dip.

2279
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:06,340
There's a depleted amount of serotonin.
yeah.

2280
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:07,480
Well,
yes,

2281
01:42:07,510 --> 01:42:08,500
that's established.
Yes.

2282
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:10,390
As far as I'm concerned,
it's established,

2283
01:42:10,690 --> 01:42:15,690
but they don't really know.
And there are certain therapies,

2284
01:42:16,750 --> 01:42:21,750
cbt,
cognitive behavioral therapy that works 

2285
01:42:21,750 --> 01:42:24,310
really well for people now.
What do you do when you do that?

2286
01:42:24,370 --> 01:42:26,260
I don't know because I haven't done it 
now.

2287
01:42:26,261 --> 01:42:27,760
When you're,
when you're getting,

2288
01:42:27,790 --> 01:42:28,900
do you get measured?
Like,

2289
01:42:28,901 --> 01:42:31,900
do they measure your serotonin?
They take your blood and they have.

2290
01:42:31,930 --> 01:42:33,580
They don't have,
they don't have a measurement for it.

2291
01:42:33,700 --> 01:42:34,660
Whoa.
Yeah.

2292
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:36,460
Um,
look it up.

2293
01:42:36,461 --> 01:42:38,620
But I don't,
I've googled it because I've been like,

2294
01:42:38,621 --> 01:42:40,000
how the fuck do I prove this?

2295
01:42:40,030 --> 01:42:42,370
But theY can't have serotonin syndrome.
Right?

2296
01:42:42,371 --> 01:42:47,371
Where you were taking five htp and an 
ssri and it gives you too much 

2297
01:42:47,371 --> 01:42:47,590
serotonin.
It cAn really fuck with you.

2298
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:52,680
Yeah.
So how do they know it's given you too 

2299
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:52,680
much there?
I think by the symptoms,

2300
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:54,580
um,
seems like,

2301
01:42:54,730 --> 01:42:59,730
it seems weird that they don't have a 
way of measuring what your levels are 

2302
01:42:59,730 --> 01:42:59,760
because can they originally level the 
dope?

2303
01:42:59,761 --> 01:43:01,600
I mean,
I don't think so.

2304
01:43:03,580 --> 01:43:05,530
The brain is so fucking calm.
Oh,

2305
01:43:05,531 --> 01:43:10,531
they know nothing.
They know nothing about it because it's 

2306
01:43:10,531 --> 01:43:10,531
impossible to.
There's no.

2307
01:43:10,531 --> 01:43:11,740
you know what I mean?
It's like you can look at a heart.

2308
01:43:11,770 --> 01:43:14,170
Most of it that's physical,
it's just like blood,

2309
01:43:14,171 --> 01:43:15,880
the thing,
the liquid goes in,

2310
01:43:16,390 --> 01:43:17,950
then it comes out.
It's mechanical,

2311
01:43:17,951 --> 01:43:20,080
whereas the brain is not mechanical 
will.

2312
01:43:20,081 --> 01:43:22,270
one of the things that you brought up 
was Carl Hart,

2313
01:43:22,271 --> 01:43:23,230
Dr.
Carl Hart,

2314
01:43:23,231 --> 01:43:28,231
and there's a lot of really brilliant 
people today that are trying to get 

2315
01:43:28,231 --> 01:43:29,670
people to understand addictions and 
what,

2316
01:43:29,671 --> 01:43:31,480
what are the root cause of addiction.

2317
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:35,920
And gabor montay had uh,
some interesting stuff to say about that

2318
01:43:35,921 --> 01:43:40,420
too in the movie the culture high and 
one of the main issues are talking about

2319
01:43:40,421 --> 01:43:45,421
is that a lot of these people that are 
addicted that deal with addictions or 

2320
01:43:45,421 --> 01:43:49,591
people that are depressed and people 
that have like these moments in their 

2321
01:43:49,591 --> 01:43:52,711
life,
they're trying to get over the hump 

2322
01:43:52,711 --> 01:43:54,570
there dealing with childhood abuse or 
their ge dealing with childhood stress 

2323
01:43:55,010 --> 01:43:59,050
or really trying to tell me I have ptsd.
Yeah.

2324
01:43:59,130 --> 01:44:01,220
A lot of therapists will minute will you
had,

2325
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:03,650
you didn't have the easiest childhood?
No,

2326
01:44:04,070 --> 01:44:07,100
I think it's partially like my dad never
hit me,

2327
01:44:07,101 --> 01:44:09,620
but he used to beat the shit out of my 
brothers and I was like three,

2328
01:44:10,340 --> 01:44:12,890
so I think that must have been like,
yeah,

2329
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:14,870
traumatic.
How could it not be?

2330
01:44:15,170 --> 01:44:16,660
How could it not be,
you know,

2331
01:44:17,150 --> 01:44:19,580
I mean I can imagine that.
I can't even imagine that.

2332
01:44:20,150 --> 01:44:20,930
yeah,
it was shitty.

2333
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:23,720
It's just a shitty way to.
And then like there's so many kids,

2334
01:44:23,721 --> 01:44:26,570
you don't get enough nutrients 
basically.

2335
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:27,530
Yeah.
So.

2336
01:44:27,531 --> 01:44:29,030
And they say like a lot of that,

2337
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:32,340
a lot of serotonin levels are based on 
a.

2338
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:34,220
That early shit

2339
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:36,200
can only.
It only makes sense.

2340
01:44:36,310 --> 01:44:41,310
Yeah.
It only makes sense that your brain is 

2341
01:44:41,310 --> 01:44:42,980
programmed based on the experiences that
it has to deal with.

2342
01:44:43,010 --> 01:44:44,570
Yeah.
And then if you're dealing with,

2343
01:44:44,870 --> 01:44:47,510
that's one of the things they sAy about 
extremely violent neighborhoods.

2344
01:44:47,780 --> 01:44:50,960
Kids that grow up in violent.
Like michael irvin was telling me this,

2345
01:44:51,170 --> 01:44:54,590
the kids that grow up in violent 
families and around violence,

2346
01:44:54,740 --> 01:44:59,740
tHey'd literally from the womb,
the mother as she's dealing with high 

2347
01:44:59,740 --> 01:45:00,740
cortisol levels and stress levels and 
adrenaline.

2348
01:45:00,741 --> 01:45:05,741
Yes.
The mother is programming the child 

2349
01:45:05,741 --> 01:45:05,741
from,
from the time it's inside of our body to

2350
01:45:05,741 --> 01:45:10,511
be more reactive,
to explode till I feel like cortisol at 

2351
01:45:10,511 --> 01:45:11,730
an early age.
I feel like killed serotonin.

2352
01:45:12,590 --> 01:45:14,390
You know what I mean?
I could be making that up,

2353
01:45:14,391 --> 01:45:16,510
but it sounds right.
So d,

2354
01:45:16,550 --> 01:45:21,550
would you categorize what you're doing 
by having these experiences with 

2355
01:45:21,981 --> 01:45:25,150
ketamine?
like a rewiring do you think you read?

2356
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:27,380
So that's what you're saying earlier.
Think I'm cRazy,

2357
01:45:27,410 --> 01:45:30,380
but there have been times in the last 
week,

2358
01:45:31,130 --> 01:45:36,130
um,
where I can feel my brain physically not

2359
01:45:36,571 --> 01:45:40,070
moving,
but like adjusting,

2360
01:45:40,090 --> 01:45:40,910
dealing

2361
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:45,360
like maybe looks like certain amount of 
energy was inside that area,

2362
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:46,150
right?

2363
01:45:46,770 --> 01:45:51,770
He fucking knows what it is.
Like theY know about like dendrites and 

2364
01:45:51,770 --> 01:45:53,120
fucking and nerve endings,
all that shit.

2365
01:45:53,121 --> 01:45:55,250
But they don't know About.
They don't really know.

2366
01:45:55,430 --> 01:45:58,280
They just know chemicals and the,
and the synopsis that's.

2367
01:45:58,310 --> 01:45:59,990
But they don't know exactly how they 
interact.

2368
01:45:59,991 --> 01:46:04,991
Even.
so I felt my brain is felt different.

2369
01:46:05,271 --> 01:46:08,240
Physical and my sleep has been all over 
the place.

2370
01:46:09,020 --> 01:46:14,020
One night I couldn't.
I woke up at six and couldn't get back 

2371
01:46:14,020 --> 01:46:16,811
to sleep like,
and then another day I slept till like 

2372
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:19,040
11 in the morning,
you know what I mean?

2373
01:46:19,041 --> 01:46:21,530
Or 11 and 12 like late.
So it's been all over the place.

2374
01:46:21,531 --> 01:46:24,620
which let you know,
like there's an adjustment going on.

2375
01:46:24,930 --> 01:46:27,690
Do you get sun in your bedroom?
Yeah.

2376
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:29,880
You don't sleep with curtains now 
closed.

2377
01:46:30,180 --> 01:46:31,680
So when the sun comes in and you wake 
up.

2378
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:32,950
No,
that's.

2379
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:34,480
Do it right now.
We're supposed to do.

2380
01:46:35,290 --> 01:46:37,750
That's.
That goes to that waking up sunshine.

2381
01:46:37,751 --> 01:46:37,920
Yeah.

2382
01:46:38,530 --> 01:46:39,780
Um,
so,

2383
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:45,800
and the other thing,
the other symptom that I feel like it's 

2384
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:46,290
about as I've been writing more like 
fucking thank god.

2385
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:51,760
Yeah.
Thank you for not just writing more but 

2386
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:51,760
being more productive with your writing.
Yeah.

2387
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,160
Right.
More productive with it.

2388
01:46:53,270 --> 01:46:55,230
And you don't strike me as a guy who 
would be lazy,

2389
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:55,700
like not

2390
01:46:56,070 --> 01:46:56,760
no,
but,

2391
01:46:56,820 --> 01:46:58,800
but like,
you know,

2392
01:46:58,880 --> 01:46:59,520
I'm,
I'm not,

2393
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:01,800
I'm not like,
if I don't have an idea,

2394
01:47:01,801 --> 01:47:02,700
I just don't.
Right,

2395
01:47:02,820 --> 01:47:04,020
right.
I'm not one of these people like,

2396
01:47:04,090 --> 01:47:07,050
nah,
there's something funny about the sky,

2397
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:10,530
like let's figure it out.
That's kind of how it's been for me.

2398
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,010
I draw,
I write entries,

2399
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:18,380
right?
Like blog entries or essaYs and then I 

2400
01:47:18,380 --> 01:47:19,910
extract funny ideas from what I've been 
doing that I feel like if I sit down and

2401
01:47:19,911 --> 01:47:21,710
just try to write joke,
joke jokes,

2402
01:47:22,250 --> 01:47:25,040
it's not my style.
It's not the most effective way.

2403
01:47:25,041 --> 01:47:28,920
Like I create a lot of like a pulp.
There's a lot of nonsense.

2404
01:47:29,130 --> 01:47:34,130
Don't fucking tell me about it,
but I have accepted that as a part of 

2405
01:47:34,130 --> 01:47:34,950
the process that like mining.
Yeah.

2406
01:47:34,970 --> 01:47:37,250
LIke you don't just tap into a mountain 
and go,

2407
01:47:37,310 --> 01:47:38,600
oh look,
it's all gold,

2408
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:42,500
no gold mixed in with rock and bullshit 
and you got to find it.

2409
01:47:42,590 --> 01:47:47,590
And again,
I think some people are just better at 

2410
01:47:47,590 --> 01:47:48,170
distilling their shit or they are shit 
comes to the more distilled.

2411
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:51,110
But don't you think though that for me 
at least,

2412
01:47:51,111 --> 01:47:54,290
almost all of it sucks until I bring it 
to the stage.

2413
01:47:54,530 --> 01:47:57,200
Like almost I have to find out what it 
really is.

2414
01:47:57,290 --> 01:48:00,290
I have to like push it out in front of 
people.

2415
01:48:00,470 --> 01:48:04,140
I got this new bit that I worked out 
last night for the first time ever died,

2416
01:48:04,250 --> 01:48:06,650
ice house and as I was working in I was 
like,

2417
01:48:06,740 --> 01:48:07,790
oh,
finally.

2418
01:48:07,791 --> 01:48:10,160
I know because I didn't know like 
before.

2419
01:48:10,161 --> 01:48:11,600
I was like,
is there something in this?

2420
01:48:11,650 --> 01:48:13,250
I don't know if there's anything in 
this.

2421
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:15,110
That's the thing about comedy is you're 
never sure.

2422
01:48:15,140 --> 01:48:16,460
Yeah.
You never fucking sure.

2423
01:48:16,550 --> 01:48:19,510
So I don't.
I literally go on with this guy.

2424
01:48:19,580 --> 01:48:20,480
I don't know.
I,

2425
01:48:20,510 --> 01:48:25,510
I see.
If you ask me to bet I'd lose money a 

2426
01:48:25,510 --> 01:48:28,961
lot and then sometimes it's like a 
tagline as the funniest guy in the huge 

2427
01:48:28,961 --> 01:48:30,160
laugh and you're lIke,
oh all right.

2428
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:31,910
Or a throwaway.
I'll set it.

2429
01:48:34,490 --> 01:48:37,310
Taking the credit.
I'll take the current figure was where I

2430
01:48:37,311 --> 01:48:40,090
thought.
Do you think that that attitude that,

2431
01:48:40,091 --> 01:48:45,091
that thinking about the credit,
like what we're talking about before 

2432
01:48:45,091 --> 01:48:48,250
that was the boost that you got was you 
would get ego and you would get 

2433
01:48:48,250 --> 01:48:48,250
adrenaline.
You wouldn't get the joy.

2434
01:48:48,250 --> 01:48:50,840
Do you think that it's detrimental to 
concentrate on the credit?

2435
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:53,770
Do you think that it's better to achieve
like a state?

2436
01:48:53,780 --> 01:48:55,120
Yeah.
well that's the thing of like,

2437
01:48:55,121 --> 01:48:55,220
like

2438
01:48:55,230 --> 01:48:57,900
the thing I've said on here before,
when me and david did the show,

2439
01:48:57,901 --> 01:49:01,050
we wouldn't tell people who wrote what 
cause it was like,

2440
01:49:01,290 --> 01:49:03,870
it's none of your business because 
you're just going to use it to judge.

2441
01:49:03,871 --> 01:49:05,790
The person didn't write it,
who didn't come up with it.

2442
01:49:05,791 --> 01:49:07,170
So.
So yeah,

2443
01:49:07,171 --> 01:49:07,920
I don't,
I,

2444
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:13,380
for whenever I'm with a group of people,
if I'm writing in a room,

2445
01:49:14,610 --> 01:49:19,610
my feeling is generally how it works 
with me is I don't pitch anything for 

2446
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:22,660
awhile upfront and I'm like,
dude,

2447
01:49:22,661 --> 01:49:24,140
you fucking pissed.
I'm pissed.

2448
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:29,440
I'm.
And then by the end I've either caught 

2449
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:30,510
up or beat most of the people,
like because I,

2450
01:49:31,710 --> 01:49:33,630
I just want to contribute,
you know what I meAn?

2451
01:49:33,631 --> 01:49:35,730
Like just I just want to contribute to 
the right.

2452
01:49:36,030 --> 01:49:37,920
So,
but the idea,

2453
01:49:37,921 --> 01:49:39,600
I don't get to,
I want to,

2454
01:49:39,630 --> 01:49:44,630
I want to hold my own,
but I'm not like I'm going to fucking 

2455
01:49:44,630 --> 01:49:45,270
vanquish these motherfuckers because 
it's comedy.

2456
01:49:45,271 --> 01:49:48,010
It's like it's silly and like how you 
come up

2457
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:52,600
with it as come so communal that it's,
well in that sense,

2458
01:49:52,601 --> 01:49:55,060
but I'm talking about in the sense of 
actually writing things for you,

2459
01:49:55,090 --> 01:49:57,010
for you on stage.
Not in the writer's room.

2460
01:49:57,011 --> 01:49:58,450
We write for a sitcom or something like 
that.

2461
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:01,750
We're talking about like you coming up 
with the tagline out of nowhere and go,

2462
01:50:01,751 --> 01:50:02,530
well,
I'll take it.

2463
01:50:02,531 --> 01:50:04,500
I still want credit for that.
No,

2464
01:50:05,110 --> 01:50:07,210
I'm kidding.
I'm joking about it in that.

2465
01:50:07,570 --> 01:50:09,760
I guess it's like the ego.
It's just like,

2466
01:50:09,761 --> 01:50:13,000
I didn't know that was thing.
It's like the guy who invents,

2467
01:50:13,150 --> 01:50:14,950
that happens a lot with pharmaceuticals 
actually.

2468
01:50:15,190 --> 01:50:17,570
They think it's for high blood pressure 
and then it ends up being for,

2469
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:18,980
for.
Yeah.

2470
01:50:19,660 --> 01:50:20,890
Yeah.
So it's like,

2471
01:50:20,891 --> 01:50:25,891
oh cool.
But I Don't whether the credit thing I 

2472
01:50:25,891 --> 01:50:26,740
don't get too hung up with.
I'm like glad that I came up with it,

2473
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:27,790
but I'm like,
you were.

2474
01:50:27,790 --> 01:50:30,070
There's such,
you know,

2475
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:32,650
chaff,
like just fucking nothing.

2476
01:50:33,030 --> 01:50:38,030
Yeah.
And then it's what's nice is when you 

2477
01:50:38,030 --> 01:50:40,801
have a thought or like a long held idea 
about something and then eight years 

2478
01:50:41,981 --> 01:50:43,740
later you come with a joke for it.
Yeah.

2479
01:50:43,870 --> 01:50:47,590
And for me also,
sometimes I find puzzle pieces and they,

2480
01:50:47,591 --> 01:50:50,620
they're like little islands and also 
connect,

2481
01:50:50,621 --> 01:50:53,260
click together and they have a bridge 
and then they become awesome.

2482
01:50:53,290 --> 01:50:55,000
Like I know where I'm like,
oh my god,

2483
01:50:55,001 --> 01:50:58,090
you puzzle buddy.
Come on now you're exciting.

2484
01:50:58,091 --> 01:50:59,920
Now you're a part of a little little.
Yeah.

2485
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:01,120
Continent.
YeS.

2486
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:02,380
Not an island anymore.
Yeah.

2487
01:51:02,410 --> 01:51:05,590
Because after a while,
if you have enough bits in your act,

2488
01:51:05,591 --> 01:51:09,070
if you have like five or six ideas or 
eight or whatever,

2489
01:51:09,370 --> 01:51:14,370
then you can just.
You'll just end up filling up those 

2490
01:51:14,370 --> 01:51:15,190
eight more than like,
I got to come with two more.

2491
01:51:15,550 --> 01:51:16,870
Just like the eight.
Get longer.

2492
01:51:17,260 --> 01:51:19,270
With this little puzzle pieces.
Now,

2493
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:24,480
after doing these six treatments,
do you anticipate this being like a 

2494
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:26,280
quarterly thing that you do to just keep
your,

2495
01:51:26,310 --> 01:51:31,310
your brain charts in the state told me 
that there's a guy who does it once a 

2496
01:51:31,310 --> 01:51:35,430
month,
whether he feels like it needs it or 

2497
01:51:35,430 --> 01:51:35,430
not.
Um,

2498
01:51:35,430 --> 01:51:35,680
by the way,
I should say it's 600 bucks a treatment.

2499
01:51:36,130 --> 01:51:36,970
Jesus.
Yeah.

2500
01:51:37,210 --> 01:51:38,040
So a lot of money.
Yeah.

2501
01:51:38,530 --> 01:51:40,780
So you are.
But by the way,

2502
01:51:40,781 --> 01:51:42,370
they were like,
it's 3,500

2503
01:51:42,371 --> 01:51:42,910
bucks.
I was like,

2504
01:51:42,940 --> 01:51:46,010
I'll give you name your price if it's 
going to work,

2505
01:51:46,330 --> 01:51:48,670
I'll give you half my life saving.
I don't give a fuck.

2506
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:49,510
right.
Like,

2507
01:51:49,511 --> 01:51:53,110
it's none of this shit means anything if
I'm not happy.

2508
01:51:53,260 --> 01:51:54,940
Not only that,
as an artist,

2509
01:51:55,030 --> 01:51:57,760
as someone who is more productive,
if you're happy.

2510
01:51:57,761 --> 01:51:59,530
Yeah.
It's worth a shitload of money.

2511
01:51:59,540 --> 01:52:01,330
Yeah.
That's 100 percent true.

2512
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:03,970
And also more productive when your 
brain's working properly.

2513
01:52:04,030 --> 01:52:05,920
How long has this gentleman been doing 
this?

2514
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:09,100
Um,
didn't ask,

2515
01:52:10,180 --> 01:52:11,900
but he has one guy,
anesthesiologists,

2516
01:52:12,110 --> 01:52:14,140
uh,
he that by trade,

2517
01:52:14,141 --> 01:52:15,920
he was an anesthesiologist.
And uh,

2518
01:52:16,510 --> 01:52:17,590
and,
and by the way,

2519
01:52:17,591 --> 01:52:19,240
it's also,
it's approved by the fda.

2520
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:24,640
That's what's so crazy.
The first thing I said when I came out 

2521
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:24,640
of the trip,
I go,

2522
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:26,710
I can't believe the fda approved that.
How did they know?

2523
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:27,820
like,
I,

2524
01:52:27,850 --> 01:52:30,010
cause it works.
It's like he said,

2525
01:52:30,011 --> 01:52:35,011
it's like 70 to 80 percent of people 
that works with the depression with,

2526
01:52:35,740 --> 01:52:38,230
with persistent depression,
like persistent,

2527
01:52:38,231 --> 01:52:41,500
kind of mildly untreatable depression.
What if people aren't depressed?

2528
01:52:42,070 --> 01:52:43,510
What about a guy like me?
I don't know.

2529
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:45,670
Hm.
I dunno know,

2530
01:52:46,210 --> 01:52:49,730
continue the monkey in which you fucking
neurology there.

2531
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:51,200
Yogan.
I mean they might,

2532
01:52:51,201 --> 01:52:56,201
I don't think it'll fucks me up.
I don't think it will fuck you up 

2533
01:52:56,201 --> 01:52:56,201
anymore than dmt or flipped me over 
there.

2534
01:52:56,201 --> 01:52:58,730
I was scared or anything I was going to 
do iowasca.

2535
01:52:58,990 --> 01:53:01,460
Um,
and then the more I read about it,

2536
01:53:01,461 --> 01:53:02,150
I was like,
eh.

2537
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:08,080
It's like,
what's my really throwing up for hours 

2538
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:10,700
and fighting diarrhea.
And then it alSo seemed like nebulous in

2539
01:53:10,701 --> 01:53:11,960
terms of a,
his,

2540
01:53:11,990 --> 01:53:14,330
that what happens or not.
I've only done dmt.

2541
01:53:14,390 --> 01:53:19,390
I've done the pure extract,
which is what would iowasca is a slow 

2542
01:53:19,390 --> 01:53:21,290
release version of dmt.
Okay.

2543
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:23,900
So what happens is with dmt,
they,

2544
01:53:23,990 --> 01:53:27,310
they get it down to this freebase form.
Just essentially they,

2545
01:53:27,350 --> 01:53:32,350
they process it down to the rock 
crystals and you smoke that and you get 

2546
01:53:32,350 --> 01:53:34,160
pure dmt or the way rick strassman did 
it.

2547
01:53:34,490 --> 01:53:39,490
Rick strassman finally we rescheduled.
His health is doing much better and 

2548
01:53:39,490 --> 01:53:41,660
he'll be here on august thing.
He's going to be here in august.

2549
01:53:42,230 --> 01:53:43,370
Um,
uh,

2550
01:53:43,371 --> 01:53:46,580
but he wrote a great book called dmt,
the spirit molecule.

2551
01:53:46,581 --> 01:53:47,720
It's basically,
I made a documentary,

2552
01:53:47,721 --> 01:53:48,380
right?
Yeah.

2553
01:53:48,410 --> 01:53:50,920
And I hosted the documentary.
It's in my queue.

2554
01:53:50,930 --> 01:53:51,410
Joe.
Yeah,

2555
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:53,960
we'll go watch a beautiful.
Um,

2556
01:53:54,050 --> 01:53:55,310
and.
But the,

2557
01:53:55,420 --> 01:54:00,420
it was,
it means you're connected to rick's 

2558
01:54:00,420 --> 01:54:02,831
work,
but it was a lot of other experts and 

2559
01:54:02,831 --> 01:54:05,051
dennis mckenna on a lot of different 
people interviewed talking about the 

2560
01:54:05,051 --> 01:54:05,930
drug.
But what he found,

2561
01:54:06,260 --> 01:54:08,840
he had a,
this is all fda approved as well.

2562
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:11,960
And if they did these trials out of the 
university of New Mexico where they gave

2563
01:54:11,961 --> 01:54:16,961
people intravenous dmt,
which is just like they're doing the 

2564
01:54:16,961 --> 01:54:17,280
intravenous ketamine with you,
you know,

2565
01:54:17,540 --> 01:54:22,540
boom,
right into the bloodstream and longterm 

2566
01:54:22,540 --> 01:54:22,810
effect.
Just like your experience.

2567
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:25,340
Yeah,
it's like a 45 minute trip as opposed to

2568
01:54:25,341 --> 01:54:26,760
dmt,
which is like 50 weed.

2569
01:54:26,980 --> 01:54:28,850
You smoke it rather,
which is like 15 minutes.

2570
01:54:29,330 --> 01:54:32,030
So the aiw osca,
what they've done is they've figured out

2571
01:54:32,031 --> 01:54:37,031
a way to have dmt and mao inhibitor and 
natural mao inhibitor because monoamine 

2572
01:54:38,271 --> 01:54:41,330
oxidase,
which is mao dissolve dmt in the gut.

2573
01:54:41,331 --> 01:54:43,970
So if you try to take it orally,
your body just breaks it down.

2574
01:54:43,971 --> 01:54:48,971
And one of the reasons for that is a dmt
exists in so many different plants that 

2575
01:54:48,971 --> 01:54:52,230
it was just orally active on its own.
You would get high every time you get no

2576
01:54:52,250 --> 01:54:54,170
salad,
will you be tripping your balls off,

2577
01:54:54,590 --> 01:54:55,040
you know,
it just,

2578
01:54:55,130 --> 01:54:57,500
it would be edible and it just,
you'd be freaking out.

2579
01:54:57,501 --> 01:55:02,501
You're there,
your neurotransmitter levels would go 

2580
01:55:02,501 --> 01:55:02,501
through the fucking roof every time you 
eat vegetables.

2581
01:55:02,660 --> 01:55:07,490
So he um,
they figured out how to do it with,

2582
01:55:07,590 --> 01:55:09,950
you know,
they didn't know in a hospital setting,

2583
01:55:09,951 --> 01:55:12,160
just like sort of a year to a doctor's 
office setting.

2584
01:55:12,170 --> 01:55:15,800
So like what you're doing and um,
they had know really,

2585
01:55:15,801 --> 01:55:20,801
really,
really profound results with it to the 

2586
01:55:20,801 --> 01:55:23,120
point where it was really,
really life changing shit for the people

2587
01:55:23,121 --> 01:55:24,160
that were a part of it.
Yeah.

2588
01:55:24,210 --> 01:55:26,470
because it's just like a fucking,
it's like having a law.

2589
01:55:26,510 --> 01:55:27,050
It's like,
you know,

2590
01:55:27,051 --> 01:55:29,510
when you'd see boxers working with like 
a weighted vest,

2591
01:55:30,100 --> 01:55:35,100
take the vesta.
So that's what you feel like after you 

2592
01:55:35,100 --> 01:55:35,100
got out of there.
Yeah.

2593
01:55:35,100 --> 01:55:35,100
Take the vest off.
YeAh.

2594
01:55:35,100 --> 01:55:36,950
And he took the vest off more and more 
every time you did it.

2595
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:38,870
Yeah.
And so the sixth one,

2596
01:55:38,900 --> 01:55:43,900
after the sixth one's over,
Describe what it's like the next day 

2597
01:55:43,900 --> 01:55:44,190
after the initial bay,
smaller hangover

2598
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:44,660
now because

2599
01:55:45,190 --> 01:55:48,730
hangover and just general.
And I was taking that,

2600
01:55:49,030 --> 01:55:50,980
like I said,
the scores would go down.

2601
01:55:51,550 --> 01:55:52,450
The um,
the uh,

2602
01:55:52,451 --> 01:55:56,020
it's called the bec,
a questionnaire assumption.

2603
01:55:56,490 --> 01:55:57,670
Um,
and uh,

2604
01:55:57,850 --> 01:56:02,850
and I just feel like I like my dog more 
dumb as shit,

2605
01:56:04,721 --> 01:56:08,230
but it's like I write more,
I laughed my own jokes more.

2606
01:56:08,470 --> 01:56:11,950
I like my dog more.
The other thing that he said,

2607
01:56:11,980 --> 01:56:16,150
which I was going to mention of the 
things that will make it last longer.

2608
01:56:16,180 --> 01:56:17,380
diet health,
exercise.

2609
01:56:17,830 --> 01:56:22,830
I'm a talk therapy and a close personal 
connection.

2610
01:56:24,210 --> 01:56:29,210
So what he said,
close personal connection with someone 

2611
01:56:29,210 --> 01:56:29,210
with someone with a love.
Yeah.

2612
01:56:29,630 --> 01:56:33,910
So I'm on the street,
I'm out on the streets looking,

2613
01:56:34,070 --> 01:56:35,990
looking for love in all the wrong 
places,

2614
01:56:37,370 --> 01:56:39,620
looking for a candIdate,
trying to make this,

2615
01:56:39,650 --> 01:56:42,410
make this fucking make this ketamine 
last girl.

2616
01:56:46,530 --> 01:56:50,360
Now what are you doing for exercise?
A kettlebells and treadmill,

2617
01:56:50,990 --> 01:56:53,340
which I always do.
Um,

2618
01:56:53,660 --> 01:56:56,450
so,
but it's like one of those.

2619
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:59,960
Just a youtube kettlebell exercise 
regimen.

2620
01:57:00,230 --> 01:57:01,970
Yeah.
That's hard to motivate yourself.

2621
01:57:02,330 --> 01:57:03,980
She'd go to your class.
I don't.

2622
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:04,620
The thing is

2623
01:57:04,710 --> 01:57:06,570
I don't have a hard time.
Like when I got my treadmill,

2624
01:57:06,571 --> 01:57:08,280
my accountant's lIke,
trust me,

2625
01:57:08,281 --> 01:57:10,080
you're never going to use it.
my clients get them.

2626
01:57:10,081 --> 01:57:10,740
They're using.
I was like,

2627
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:13,020
I'm irish catholic.
Like,

2628
01:57:13,021 --> 01:57:14,910
I'm fucking going to use it.
Trust me.

2629
01:57:14,911 --> 01:57:16,350
Like I will be like,

2630
01:57:16,351 --> 01:57:19,530

You will.

2631
01:57:20,920 --> 01:57:25,920
Well,
I receiveD the a and shit like that 

2632
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:25,920
question.
You're,

2633
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:25,920
we'll say,
listen,

2634
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:25,920
he's because he's an asshole.

2635
01:57:26,260 --> 01:57:29,500
Did that.
When he.

2636
01:57:29,530 --> 01:57:34,530
I invested in that tick,
that laughs stub website that does the 

2637
01:57:35,470 --> 01:57:39,610
tickets for all the comedy clubs.
I invested in it for five,

2638
01:57:39,611 --> 01:57:41,810
six years ago and he's like,
mom,

2639
01:57:41,820 --> 01:57:44,050
I don't think it's.
I quadrupled my money.

2640
01:57:45,190 --> 01:57:46,390
It was like,
by the way,

2641
01:57:46,391 --> 01:57:48,490
my dad's a fucking lawyer.
Like,

2642
01:57:48,491 --> 01:57:52,120
I'm not a rube.
My dad work was a tax lawyer.

2643
01:57:52,121 --> 01:57:53,160
Like I'm not like,
hey,

2644
01:57:53,170 --> 01:57:58,170
wait.
He when I invested in a restaurant 

2645
01:57:58,170 --> 01:57:58,170
recently,
he's like,

2646
01:57:58,170 --> 01:57:58,170
yeah,
you can sit at the corner table.

2647
01:57:58,170 --> 01:58:01,591
I'm like,
I'm not doing it to sit at the fucking 

2648
01:58:01,591 --> 01:58:01,591
corner table.
I'm doing it because I think it's a good

2649
01:58:01,591 --> 01:58:01,591
thing.

2650
01:58:01,591 --> 01:58:03,870
You need a new accountant.
He sounds like a negative nancy.

2651
01:58:03,871 --> 01:58:05,280
he is.
What a dick.

2652
01:58:05,310 --> 01:58:06,180
Yeah.
So,

2653
01:58:06,181 --> 01:58:07,860
uh,
if I had an account like that,

2654
01:58:07,861 --> 01:58:08,490
I'd Be like,
listen,

2655
01:58:08,491 --> 01:58:09,660
fuck face.
He's trying to.

2656
01:58:09,930 --> 01:58:12,630
he's trying to be cautious.
Yeah,

2657
01:58:15,410 --> 01:58:20,410
cautious people are great,
but not that cautious where you're 

2658
01:58:20,410 --> 01:58:20,410
getting cautious about a fucking 
treadmill.

2659
01:58:20,410 --> 01:58:21,030
You micromanager.
Yeah.

2660
01:58:21,150 --> 01:58:23,010
Just let them buy the treadmill.
Yeah.

2661
01:58:23,070 --> 01:58:28,070
Let the kid have some fun.
Let the kid ever fucking exercise 

2662
01:58:28,070 --> 01:58:28,690
equipment all the time.
Um,

2663
01:58:29,010 --> 01:58:30,450
and a kettlebell.
Same thing.

2664
01:58:30,510 --> 01:58:33,960
So you feel like a noticeable change 
when you have a good workout?

2665
01:58:33,961 --> 01:58:35,460
Do you feel like elevated?
You know,

2666
01:58:35,461 --> 01:58:40,040
I am yet to get that.
I didn't know at this point I just,

2667
01:58:40,140 --> 01:58:41,590
I,
because I wasn't

2668
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:44,440
because I felt shitty and didn't 
exercise for like three weeks.

2669
01:58:44,980 --> 01:58:49,980
I now I'm like fucking doing kettlebells
and I'm like fuck afterwards just 

2670
01:58:49,980 --> 01:58:50,860
because I haven't,
I'm out of shape basically.

2671
01:58:50,980 --> 01:58:53,890
Right.
So I'm in that like fucking jesus.

2672
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:57,070
So the three weeks while you were 
weaning yourself off of the drugs,

2673
01:58:57,190 --> 01:59:00,120
the last couple months I just haven't 
had time to uh,

2674
01:59:00,730 --> 01:59:03,460
to do that shit and I haven't been home 
and shit.

2675
01:59:03,461 --> 01:59:06,280
So I'm so,
but now that I'm back on it,

2676
01:59:06,460 --> 01:59:08,020
I'm hoping I've never had a runner's 
high.

2677
01:59:08,230 --> 01:59:09,040
You know what I mean?
Really?

2678
01:59:09,041 --> 01:59:09,610
Yeah,
you gotta run it.

2679
01:59:09,620 --> 01:59:11,230
I'm like,
I've never had a runner's high.

2680
01:59:11,490 --> 01:59:14,360
The fuck you talking about.
They'll require sarah town.

2681
01:59:15,340 --> 01:59:17,440
I think you've got to go deep to get a 
runner's high too.

2682
01:59:17,441 --> 01:59:19,410
You've got to be exhausted.
Yeah.

2683
01:59:20,250 --> 01:59:21,850
Yeah.
I think it's a.

2684
01:59:21,851 --> 01:59:24,670
I can't remember what the,
what the mechanIsm is,

2685
01:59:24,671 --> 01:59:25,390
why you get it.

2686
01:59:25,870 --> 01:59:28,270
It's like one of those things where your
body thinks you're dying or something.

2687
01:59:28,570 --> 01:59:33,570
My buddy cameron hanes just ran a 
fucking 24 hour run a mile track.

2688
01:59:33,820 --> 01:59:36,940
Twenty four hours.
He did 106 laps.

2689
01:59:37,330 --> 01:59:41,740
He ran 106 miles in 24 hours.
His legs swelled up twice.

2690
01:59:41,741 --> 01:59:44,710
Their size.
Feet are fucking bleed.

2691
01:59:44,711 --> 01:59:48,460
He said videos on instagram of him than 
popping these,

2692
01:59:48,461 --> 01:59:50,910
uh,
blood volcanoes and his feet pop.

2693
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:55,920
It squirts up in the air.
what did he do it for it to be an 

2694
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:57,920
asshole so that everybody knows that he 
can run 100 miles.

2695
01:59:57,940 --> 01:59:59,500
Body hoped out afterward.
Like,

2696
01:59:59,501 --> 02:00:01,270
I guess we're a hope now.
Fuck it.

2697
02:00:01,271 --> 02:00:03,550
Let's hook up.
He pushes himself.

2698
02:00:03,551 --> 02:00:05,440
He's really into pushing himself.
You know,

2699
02:00:05,441 --> 02:00:07,510
like testing is meant.
Mental toughness.

2700
02:00:07,540 --> 02:00:10,720
Testing is his mental boundaries because
he ran 100,

2701
02:00:10,721 --> 02:00:13,750
six miles fucking psycho.
He's crazy.

2702
02:00:14,650 --> 02:00:17,620
He's a professional bowhunter.
He's a crazy guy.

2703
02:00:17,650 --> 02:00:19,120
Was it is?
He saId no more.

2704
02:00:19,240 --> 02:00:24,240
He regularly throws a hundred and 35 
pound rock and his backpack and climbs 

2705
02:00:24,731 --> 02:00:29,731
up hills to simulate.
Look what it's like the pack out meat 

2706
02:00:29,731 --> 02:00:31,100
when you're hunting because you got to 
these mountain hunters.

2707
02:00:31,190 --> 02:00:36,190
Mountain hunting is incredibly difficult
to do physically when you did.

2708
02:00:36,670 --> 02:00:41,670
I've done it a couple times,
but the climbing up was the most 

2709
02:00:41,670 --> 02:00:41,710
shocking.
Like how tireD you get.

2710
02:00:42,120 --> 02:00:43,780
Like I'm in shape,
I work out all the time.

2711
02:00:44,260 --> 02:00:46,080
I'll climb that mountain bitch.
But he goes,

2712
02:00:46,140 --> 02:00:48,530
it's like,
holy fuck you if you.

2713
02:00:48,620 --> 02:00:51,880
If you're not doing thAt specifically,
like constantly climbing,

2714
02:00:52,150 --> 02:00:57,150
you get fucking exhausted.
So he gets an [inaudible] and then you 

2715
02:00:57,150 --> 02:00:58,040
miss out on opportunities and he's a 
professional.

2716
02:00:58,041 --> 02:00:59,380
That's what he does.
So he does it.

2717
02:00:59,630 --> 02:01:04,630
He gets in shape literally for that and 
then along the way got addicted to 

2718
02:01:04,630 --> 02:01:05,050
getting in shape,
you know?

2719
02:01:05,050 --> 02:01:08,700
And then you get addicted to results and
addicted to perform them came to new.

2720
02:01:09,490 --> 02:01:14,490
The other thing I was going to mention 
was the sense taking the ketamine.

2721
02:01:15,580 --> 02:01:18,050
My recall has gotten better memory.
Yeah.

2722
02:01:18,240 --> 02:01:23,240
Because that's the.
The thing that is sort of an unsung 

2723
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:24,230
about depression.
It fucks your memory up.

2724
02:01:24,820 --> 02:01:26,830
Like you can't recall words.
Well,

2725
02:01:26,831 --> 02:01:31,831
it makes sense because memories 
increased by upping your 

2726
02:01:31,831 --> 02:01:31,831
neurotransmitters.
Yeah.

2727
02:01:31,831 --> 02:01:36,300
When you take nootropics,
that's one of the things that we found 

2728
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:36,300
when we did the double blind placebo 
studies on,

2729
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:39,230
at the boston center for memory with um,
alpha brain.

2730
02:01:39,260 --> 02:01:40,010
Was that one of the

2731
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:42,410
big markers that had increased in his 
memory,

2732
02:01:42,740 --> 02:01:45,710
memory and even reaction time,
executive function,

2733
02:01:45,711 --> 02:01:46,500
all those things.
Yeah.

2734
02:01:46,590 --> 02:01:48,860
You attaching to like,
or the,

2735
02:01:48,861 --> 02:01:53,861
the opposite of it.
You were attaching to depressing this 

2736
02:01:53,861 --> 02:01:54,240
slowness is drag this weight.

2737
02:01:54,390 --> 02:01:56,130
Yet the other thing,
last night,

2738
02:01:56,180 --> 02:02:01,180
last two nights when I've been at clubs,
I remember everyone's name normally.

2739
02:02:01,201 --> 02:02:01,880
I'm like,
I,

2740
02:02:02,230 --> 02:02:04,290
I don't,
I think I know your name.

2741
02:02:04,291 --> 02:02:09,291
I couldn't tell you what it is.
Like I could see their name next to 

2742
02:02:09,291 --> 02:02:09,980
their face.
Um,

2743
02:02:10,430 --> 02:02:15,430
switch again,
just the weird thing that you don't 

2744
02:02:15,430 --> 02:02:15,430
think about.
And then when it happened,

2745
02:02:15,430 --> 02:02:15,630
like fucking.
okay,

2746
02:02:15,631 --> 02:02:17,310
good.
I thought my memory's fucked up.

2747
02:02:17,470 --> 02:02:22,470
If I couldn't remember how.
I used to think of you when I first met 

2748
02:02:22,470 --> 02:02:23,880
you,
like way back at the boston comedy club,

2749
02:02:24,280 --> 02:02:27,120
you would never like jovial.
You never like well,

2750
02:02:27,130 --> 02:02:29,440
like real happy.
Cool.

2751
02:02:29,890 --> 02:02:34,890
We're always,
we always were friendly to each other 

2752
02:02:34,890 --> 02:02:34,890
and throw the ball around a little.
Yeah.

2753
02:02:34,890 --> 02:02:35,550
But you know what I'm saying,
you know,

2754
02:02:36,610 --> 02:02:37,810
but I was a kid,
I was like that.

2755
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:42,840
THere was a picture of me as a baby one 
or one and a half and I'm like literally

2756
02:02:44,331 --> 02:02:48,260
staring at the Picture,
like staring at the camera and chappelle

2757
02:02:48,261 --> 02:02:53,261
goes.
And you've had that look on your face 

2758
02:02:53,261 --> 02:02:53,690
ever since.
Yeah.

2759
02:02:53,691 --> 02:02:55,480
You were always kind of stoic.
Yeah.

2760
02:02:55,490 --> 02:02:56,870
And it's not in.
The thing is,

2761
02:02:56,871 --> 02:03:00,230
it's like the other thing,
it sucks going through life going like I

2762
02:03:00,231 --> 02:03:03,180
know there's something better.
I know there's something,

2763
02:03:03,190 --> 02:03:07,790
I don't want to be like this.
Like I know that there is a.

2764
02:03:08,030 --> 02:03:12,050
I know if I wasn't like this,
life would be more enjoyable and like,

2765
02:03:12,110 --> 02:03:14,030
and I know it's not,
you know,

2766
02:03:14,031 --> 02:03:17,330
it's the thing with depression is a lot 
of times people think it's just like,

2767
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:18,500
oh,
well you don't look.

2768
02:03:18,501 --> 02:03:23,501
And it's like when Henry Rollins said 
fucking can't believe robin williams 

2769
02:03:23,501 --> 02:03:23,501
killed himself,
it's like,

2770
02:03:23,501 --> 02:03:25,010
well then you don't fucking understand 
depression dickhead.

2771
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:27,890
It's not like getting lung cancer 
because you didn't even breathe.

2772
02:03:27,891 --> 02:03:28,190
Right.

2773
02:03:28,290 --> 02:03:32,280
He's got that Whole suck it up attitude 
down pat.

2774
02:03:32,310 --> 02:03:35,160
Yeah.
But I don't,

2775
02:03:35,310 --> 02:03:37,110
I,
I can't subscribe to that.

2776
02:03:37,111 --> 02:03:38,940
I,
I've known way too many people that have

2777
02:03:38,941 --> 02:03:43,941
had like real fucking problems with it 
and I think it can be adjusted with the 

2778
02:03:44,820 --> 02:03:47,760
behavior modifications,
the way you treat people,

2779
02:03:47,761 --> 02:03:50,430
the way you interface with people with 
exercise,

2780
02:03:50,431 --> 02:03:52,560
with diet a little bit.
There's a lot going on,

2781
02:03:52,740 --> 02:03:54,360
but some people,
man,

2782
02:03:54,390 --> 02:03:57,510
it's not enough.
Some people are still fucking depressed.

2783
02:03:57,511 --> 02:03:57,700
Yeah.
YeaH.

2784
02:03:57,910 --> 02:04:02,910
That's.
I've gone to therapy fucking 15 years 

2785
02:04:02,910 --> 02:04:03,160
already.
Said mushrooms helped him a lot.

2786
02:04:03,580 --> 02:04:08,580
Yeah.
There's a lot of people say lIke 

2787
02:04:08,580 --> 02:04:08,580
mushrooms,
they're trying to.

2788
02:04:08,580 --> 02:04:09,520
They're mushrooms is in this whole 
ketamine,

2789
02:04:09,870 --> 02:04:12,980
a bogus goba he bogus.
I'm abigail.

2790
02:04:13,190 --> 02:04:14,080
I've ibogaine.
Yeah,

2791
02:04:14,081 --> 02:04:15,640
but the extracts,
um,

2792
02:04:16,650 --> 02:04:17,340
I will ask,
uh,

2793
02:04:17,390 --> 02:04:18,640
all that shit.
Um,

2794
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:23,760
there's a thing in,
in south America they can go or Costa 

2795
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:26,830
Rica that it's like an ego but an 
ibogaine retreat and you see there are 

2796
02:04:28,211 --> 02:04:33,211
videos on this retreat thing.
You see a guy transform it a week and 

2797
02:04:33,211 --> 02:04:34,630
it's not fake.
Right?

2798
02:04:34,750 --> 02:04:37,030
You can see it in his carriage and his 
eyes.

2799
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:37,950
It's amazing.

2800
02:04:38,610 --> 02:04:40,470
Um,
so yeah,

2801
02:04:40,471 --> 02:04:45,471
I think some people just like,
you got to fucking hard to a hard 

2802
02:04:45,471 --> 02:04:45,471
restart.
Yeah.

2803
02:04:45,471 --> 02:04:47,670
Hard restarts are great for phones and 
people.

2804
02:04:47,790 --> 02:04:52,790
Yeah.
which brings me to the samsung galaxy s 

2805
02:04:52,790 --> 02:04:52,790
six.
You know,

2806
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:54,780
when you do the math,
it's simple.

2807
02:04:55,500 --> 02:04:58,590
Six is greater than six.
What is that?

2808
02:04:58,591 --> 02:05:02,790
One of the asset is being beach do punch
up on that,

2809
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:06,510
but they don't.
I can't pick what they pick.

2810
02:05:07,770 --> 02:05:09,960
They should listen to you.
I think they're popular though.

2811
02:05:10,070 --> 02:05:12,210
They may,
sometimes they're very popular,

2812
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:13,780
But like the,
I think the ads are properly,

2813
02:05:13,830 --> 02:05:14,990
so I can't argue with them.
Well,

2814
02:05:14,991 --> 02:05:18,300
let's just follow those ads on youtube.
It just on tHe,

2815
02:05:18,301 --> 02:05:20,280
in the comments.
It's just everyday.

2816
02:05:20,300 --> 02:05:21,750
It's just apple.
Samsung,

2817
02:05:21,780 --> 02:05:22,800
apple said,
fuck you.

2818
02:05:22,801 --> 02:05:24,570
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

2819
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:25,400
Fuck.
It's like,

2820
02:05:25,740 --> 02:05:26,700
dude,
you got it.

2821
02:05:26,820 --> 02:05:28,470
This can't be that important.
Well,

2822
02:05:28,471 --> 02:05:30,750
people get hung up on brands so hard.

2823
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:33,810
You know?
I've had people that I've talked to that

2824
02:05:33,811 --> 02:05:36,750
say I'll never buy a ford.
I'm a fucking chevy guy.

2825
02:05:36,840 --> 02:05:38,160
You know,
like what is wrong with you?

2826
02:05:38,161 --> 02:05:41,400
Yeah,
like how would I don't buy apple,

2827
02:05:41,401 --> 02:05:42,570
dude.
I'm a windows guy.

2828
02:05:43,500 --> 02:05:44,970
Okay.
Jesus christ.

2829
02:05:45,020 --> 02:05:50,020
It would.
If all of a sudden apple comes up with 

2830
02:05:50,020 --> 02:05:52,011
the greatest thing ever,
you're going to stick to your guns 

2831
02:05:52,011 --> 02:05:52,011
because they trick you into.
Because it's not about the product.

2832
02:05:52,011 --> 02:05:53,610
It hasn't been about the product and 
advertising for 20,

2833
02:05:53,611 --> 02:05:58,611
30 years.
It's about the cultural meaning of the 

2834
02:05:58,611 --> 02:06:00,780
thing with especially big brands.
Especially.

2835
02:06:00,810 --> 02:06:04,500
That's why like sneaker companies and 
Chile that once they go south,

2836
02:06:05,080 --> 02:06:06,930
once they are for losers.
Good.

2837
02:06:06,931 --> 02:06:08,100
Forget it.
Forget it.

2838
02:06:08,130 --> 02:06:13,130
Good luck.
Once you see one homeless guy wearing 

2839
02:06:13,130 --> 02:06:15,951
them and I'm talking to.
I'm talking to you and one once.

2840
02:06:16,330 --> 02:06:16,830
She's.
What?

2841
02:06:16,831 --> 02:06:20,970
I would see any like once you see or 
like penn one had a day in the sun,

2842
02:06:21,350 --> 02:06:22,260
but it's only two years.

2843
02:06:22,260 --> 02:06:24,120
Yeah,
but this homeless guy,

2844
02:06:24,180 --> 02:06:29,180
I don't know.
It's interesting that I'm sure it's 

2845
02:06:29,180 --> 02:06:29,180
interesting.
They fucked up their brand.

2846
02:06:29,180 --> 02:06:33,740
Yeah.
What other brands would you say are 

2847
02:06:33,740 --> 02:06:34,920
inexorable and unfixable pony in the 
eighties?

2848
02:06:35,310 --> 02:06:37,140
Ponies back though.
Date?

2849
02:06:37,141 --> 02:06:38,060
No,
they tried.

2850
02:06:38,070 --> 02:06:40,760
Puma.
Puma is a little shaky for they will.

2851
02:06:40,770 --> 02:06:45,770
There are some that kind of classic.
Some are european companies like uh,

2852
02:06:45,990 --> 02:06:50,990
I think nike owns converse and I think 
adidas and puma converse all stars never

2853
02:06:52,471 --> 02:06:57,471
stopped.
I never went to whenever they hung in 

2854
02:06:57,471 --> 02:07:00,330
there just by the fact that it's not 
expensive and bad ass fucking sneaker.

2855
02:07:00,390 --> 02:07:01,220
They just,
they're new,

2856
02:07:01,250 --> 02:07:06,250
they're new.
They're like stylish enough and neutral 

2857
02:07:06,250 --> 02:07:06,250
enough.
Yeah.

2858
02:07:06,250 --> 02:07:07,050
They don't call,
they don't go on and on about it,

2859
02:07:07,051 --> 02:07:09,000
you know what I mean?
Chuck's all day.

2860
02:07:09,330 --> 02:07:13,170
So then there's like a bunch of other 
companies that are like new balance.

2861
02:07:13,200 --> 02:07:14,100
I'm not sure.

2862
02:07:14,100 --> 02:07:15,230
Yeah.
Well new balance.

2863
02:07:15,270 --> 02:07:20,270
Some of them are just for runners,
like some are just like a [inaudible] oh

2864
02:07:20,290 --> 02:07:21,930
yeah,
new balance.

2865
02:07:22,080 --> 02:07:23,280
What about a deed?
Brooks?

2866
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:28,340
Apparently mrs.
Always going to have a certain like 

2867
02:07:28,340 --> 02:07:28,340
shell tops are always going to have a 
certain amount of class.

2868
02:07:28,340 --> 02:07:28,430
Yeah.
My.

2869
02:07:28,970 --> 02:07:31,830
And now he's got nike's got the uh,
the,

2870
02:07:32,070 --> 02:07:33,820
the pro athlete angle.
Yeah.

2871
02:07:33,821 --> 02:07:35,920
But they've got like the,
the fucking,

2872
02:07:36,720 --> 02:07:39,250
the like the super one that's been like 
cool.

2873
02:07:39,251 --> 02:07:43,170
That blank dates where the clean ones.
My white,

2874
02:07:43,450 --> 02:07:45,550
the clean ones.
I can't think of the name of it.

2875
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:50,760
Do you request in your rider a new pair 
of sneakers with every show that you 

2876
02:07:50,760 --> 02:07:51,610
did?
I do not like eddie griffin.

2877
02:07:51,700 --> 02:07:54,970
Yes.
If that shoe sneaker.

2878
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:56,890
It's the white air force one.
Air force wants.

2879
02:07:56,910 --> 02:07:59,550
Thank you very much.
So white air force ones they've Liked.

2880
02:07:59,551 --> 02:08:00,610
That's a perennIal for them.

2881
02:08:00,910 --> 02:08:01,900
A perennial.
Yeah.

2882
02:08:02,550 --> 02:08:04,810
And the,
the other one is the uh,

2883
02:08:05,890 --> 02:08:08,530
the fucking air.
It's got the,

2884
02:08:08,590 --> 02:08:13,590
it was the first one in the bubble when 
it used to be timberland's air max air 

2885
02:08:13,590 --> 02:08:13,600
max.
That is coRrect.

2886
02:08:13,750 --> 02:08:17,680
Remember when it used to be timberlands?
Timberlands with no laces.

2887
02:08:18,210 --> 02:08:19,780
And I remember I was just there.
Joe,

2888
02:08:19,910 --> 02:08:20,740
what?
What happened?

2889
02:08:20,741 --> 02:08:22,960
That wasn't jovial.
Didn't work.

2890
02:08:23,140 --> 02:08:26,110
Now in certain areas I didn't know,
they never went out.

2891
02:08:26,170 --> 02:08:28,090
They never went out in certain areas.
They'd never went.

2892
02:08:28,091 --> 02:08:30,130
I it like doc martens with depressed 
white people.

2893
02:08:30,160 --> 02:08:32,950
That is correct.
Doc martens until there was a,

2894
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:34,930
a big part of the depressed pump.
Wells.

2895
02:08:35,030 --> 02:08:36,620
Angry.
Yeah.

2896
02:08:37,030 --> 02:08:40,050
they want to be from liverpool.
NoT talking to your parents that thought

2897
02:08:40,120 --> 02:08:42,490
my parents were doing heroin,
putting my shoes.

2898
02:08:43,480 --> 02:08:48,480
I'll be on st marks if anyone needs me 
at doc martens or a weird one.

2899
02:08:48,670 --> 02:08:52,210
Like if you wore a doc martens,
you basically look giving up on the rest

2900
02:08:52,211 --> 02:08:54,610
of the society and they're not good 
looking.

2901
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:56,890
They started like skinheads made them 
popular,

2902
02:08:57,620 --> 02:09:00,940
like they were like big in the skinhead 
community and then they kind of took off

2903
02:09:00,941 --> 02:09:01,510
from there.
It's like,

2904
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:06,520
are we share?
Will he represented like a certain 

2905
02:09:06,520 --> 02:09:07,450
aesthetic like person who's just not 
following the norm?

2906
02:09:07,451 --> 02:09:09,700
You want dark things?
Clouds?

2907
02:09:09,730 --> 02:09:11,130
Yes.
Yeah.

2908
02:09:11,800 --> 02:09:16,800
Safety pins and your clothes.
Like the johnny rotten and malcolm 

2909
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:18,000
mclaren shit.
Yeah.

2910
02:09:18,550 --> 02:09:20,170
Please.
Shelf up by your bootstraps.

2911
02:09:20,171 --> 02:09:23,620
Is kevin kevin?
These fucking weirdos?

2912
02:09:23,910 --> 02:09:25,230
Yeah.
Um,

2913
02:09:25,420 --> 02:09:26,050
Yeah.
So,

2914
02:09:26,051 --> 02:09:27,580
uh,
so yeah,

2915
02:09:27,581 --> 02:09:29,800
I've got to say so far so good with the 
ketamine,

2916
02:09:30,100 --> 02:09:31,070
like it's.
No,

2917
02:09:31,080 --> 02:09:34,180
that's great to hear that you've found 
something that's an actual solution.

2918
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:38,510
yeah.
That at least in this one run I've had,

2919
02:09:38,570 --> 02:09:43,570
have had people have um,
have people had an issue similar to way 

2920
02:09:43,990 --> 02:09:47,600
you were saying that these ssri is,
they would work for a little while,

2921
02:09:47,650 --> 02:09:48,520
then they stop working.

2922
02:09:48,790 --> 02:09:50,530
Have people had an issue with like this 
with ketamine?

2923
02:09:51,170 --> 02:09:56,170
I think they've,
my feeling personally is like at a 

2924
02:09:57,791 --> 02:10:01,600
certain point I'll do something else but
um,

2925
02:10:02,110 --> 02:10:04,240
but I don't think it's a matter of 
quitting.

2926
02:10:04,241 --> 02:10:09,241
I don't know what would have.
I don't think it would be like the ssri 

2927
02:10:09,241 --> 02:10:10,090
thing is your eight chemicals leaving 
your body.

2928
02:10:10,550 --> 02:10:13,120
That's the withdrawal,
which creates like any drug withdrawal.

2929
02:10:13,121 --> 02:10:15,100
It's just your body's trying to 
compensate.

2930
02:10:15,620 --> 02:10:17,920
I'm with this.
There's no,

2931
02:10:18,100 --> 02:10:21,580
there's no ketamine in me now to speak 
of.

2932
02:10:22,360 --> 02:10:24,940
I guess there's,
maybe ketamine creates something in your

2933
02:10:24,941 --> 02:10:27,220
brain that whatever.
So.

2934
02:10:27,280 --> 02:10:32,280
Well,
that's one of the weirdest things about 

2935
02:10:32,280 --> 02:10:32,280
some psychedelic trips as you feel like 
there's rewiring going on,

2936
02:10:32,280 --> 02:10:34,550
you feel that with like they're working 
in your brain,

2937
02:10:34,551 --> 02:10:39,551
like you see them peripherally and 
you're looking at you going like doing 

2938
02:10:39,551 --> 02:10:39,590
some shit off to the side.

2939
02:10:39,590 --> 02:10:40,910
That's what I mean.
It's like going back saturday.

2940
02:10:40,950 --> 02:10:41,540
Right.
And you're just like,

2941
02:10:41,541 --> 02:10:43,040
oh fuck,
this is the.

2942
02:10:43,160 --> 02:10:43,460
Oh,
go.

2943
02:10:43,461 --> 02:10:45,470
Hey guys,
how are you?

2944
02:10:45,490 --> 02:10:46,800
Will you,
I think you're saying,

2945
02:10:46,840 --> 02:10:50,480
wait if correct me if I'm wrong,
but what you're seeing is like the roots

2946
02:10:50,690 --> 02:10:55,690
of where your behavior is coming from 
when you're saying that you see their 

2947
02:10:55,690 --> 02:10:55,690
wiring under the board.
Uh,

2948
02:10:55,910 --> 02:11:00,140
yeah,
I just see more like the board,

2949
02:11:00,380 --> 02:11:01,590
the board itself.
Yeah.

2950
02:11:01,850 --> 02:11:03,320
And not necessarily like,
oh,

2951
02:11:03,321 --> 02:11:05,180
see your childhood,
the lever.

2952
02:11:05,390 --> 02:11:10,070
Do you see your child and much see you 
in the current state?

2953
02:11:10,100 --> 02:11:11,630
I don't,
I don't really see.

2954
02:11:11,640 --> 02:11:13,310
I,
it was a pov,

2955
02:11:14,200 --> 02:11:19,200
um,
we all know pov from porn as a pov shot 

2956
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:22,850
of me basically laying in the same 
position as I was on the bed,

2957
02:11:22,851 --> 02:11:24,040
which is just like,
you know,

2958
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:29,210
sitting up in the bed.
So it was just me basically at one point

2959
02:11:29,211 --> 02:11:31,490
it became like a little rollercoaster,
like,

2960
02:11:31,491 --> 02:11:34,550
but a fun kind of smooth like water 
ride.

2961
02:11:34,940 --> 02:11:39,940
Um,
but it's just me kind of going through 

2962
02:11:39,940 --> 02:11:40,410
different things.
Um,

2963
02:11:40,790 --> 02:11:44,090
and some of the times it was just like 
white blob,

2964
02:11:44,120 --> 02:11:45,280
you know,
just like,

2965
02:11:45,890 --> 02:11:49,760
and you go into it with a mindset where 
you're trying to cure your depression or

2966
02:11:49,761 --> 02:11:54,260
you're trying to eliminate it or 
mitigate it or like I didn't.

2967
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:54,920
Yeah.
I was like,

2968
02:11:54,921 --> 02:11:56,890
I'm just hopeful.
Right.

2969
02:11:57,170 --> 02:12:02,170
Um,
but why you're having these experiences 

2970
02:12:02,170 --> 02:12:02,860
while you're on the water slide.
Is this a theme I thinking I'm,

2971
02:12:04,730 --> 02:12:09,730
are You just experiencing just kind of 
nice and nice feeling and then it's 

2972
02:12:09,730 --> 02:12:09,730
time.
So it'd be like,

2973
02:12:09,730 --> 02:12:10,820
oh fuck,
I'm in santa monica,

2974
02:12:10,821 --> 02:12:13,050
I'm trYing to treat depression.
Wow.

2975
02:12:13,160 --> 02:12:14,990
And you would think that while you're in
the middle of the trip?

2976
02:12:15,050 --> 02:12:16,100
Yes.
Wow.

2977
02:12:16,160 --> 02:12:18,020
Yeah.
And the other thing iS you could,

2978
02:12:18,050 --> 02:12:22,570
I could hear the doctors sometimes he'd 
be talking.

2979
02:12:22,610 --> 02:12:27,610
Oh,
but there was a nurse watching it the 

2980
02:12:27,610 --> 02:12:27,610
whole time.

2981
02:12:27,610 --> 02:12:27,610
A nurse she got,
she's super fucking hunt.

2982
02:12:27,950 --> 02:12:30,800
Stephanie if you Listen.
She was cute.

2983
02:12:30,801 --> 02:12:31,300
Yeah.
Jo,

2984
02:12:31,640 --> 02:12:32,330
she was,
she,

2985
02:12:32,550 --> 02:12:35,390
where the pov came in handy.
She's got a corset on.

2986
02:12:35,480 --> 02:12:36,200
Yeah,
I'm,

2987
02:12:36,330 --> 02:12:40,130
the associate was watching.
She just watches you and I was like,

2988
02:12:40,131 --> 02:12:41,240
hey,
would you videotape me?

2989
02:12:41,241 --> 02:12:41,960
And she was like,
yeah.

2990
02:12:41,961 --> 02:12:43,340
And then I got up and she's like,
you didn't do anything.

2991
02:12:43,341 --> 02:12:48,341
So it wasn't really the point,
but I'm supposed to catch me while I'm 

2992
02:12:48,341 --> 02:12:50,060
under.
So let's say this is be under.

2993
02:12:50,170 --> 02:12:51,440
Yeah,
a couple of times.

2994
02:12:51,470 --> 02:12:53,400
Got her own artistic skill around 
fucking,

2995
02:12:53,420 --> 02:12:55,430
you know,
how they get cut down there.

2996
02:12:55,431 --> 02:12:56,150
So,
uh,

2997
02:12:56,540 --> 02:12:58,970
so yeah,
so there's a nurse watching you and then

2998
02:12:59,120 --> 02:13:04,120
there was,
they also use ketamine for pain 

2999
02:13:04,120 --> 02:13:07,211
management.
If people have had chronic pain that 

3000
02:13:07,211 --> 02:13:07,211
they can't Get rid of.
Real they.

3001
02:13:07,250 --> 02:13:08,420
Yeah.
Ketamine treatment.

3002
02:13:08,510 --> 02:13:12,050
Why my academy for that?
The same fucking thing.

3003
02:13:12,310 --> 02:13:13,390
Something's going on.
Yeah.

3004
02:13:13,490 --> 02:13:16,790
The not knowing why it's effective is 
very strange.

3005
02:13:16,820 --> 02:13:18,140
Yeah.
And the dosage,

3006
02:13:18,141 --> 02:13:23,141
my understanding is the dosage is way 
less than people would take on the 

3007
02:13:23,141 --> 02:13:23,141
street.
And the fact that it's Weightless.

3008
02:13:23,141 --> 02:13:27,810
The people taking the street and I Was 
still fucking tripping my balls off is,

3009
02:13:28,280 --> 02:13:31,920
I don't know what happens on the street.
will the street ones they're taking,

3010
02:13:31,921 --> 02:13:32,040
they're

3011
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:34,620
snorting it or they're smoking it.
Oh.

3012
02:13:34,621 --> 02:13:37,200
So it's less so maybe it gets cut down 
by the body.

3013
02:13:37,770 --> 02:13:40,350
Oh god.
I imagine it's getting processed by your

3014
02:13:40,351 --> 02:13:41,480
stomach.
You know,

3015
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:43,910
it's going through your,
your organs and all that jazz.

3016
02:13:43,990 --> 02:13:45,450
You're just shooting it right into your 
blood.

3017
02:13:45,451 --> 02:13:46,950
You probably need way less.
Yeah.

3018
02:13:47,370 --> 02:13:48,540
Um,
so.

3019
02:13:49,800 --> 02:13:54,800
So yeah.
So you should look into lily looking at 

3020
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:55,800
john lilley because he really was a 
fucking nut for ketamine.

3021
02:13:55,801 --> 02:13:57,390
He became addicted to it.
Oh,

3022
02:13:57,391 --> 02:13:58,470
that's interesting.
Yeah.

3023
02:13:58,560 --> 02:14:03,560
Well he apparently was,
I can't imagine getting addicted to it 

3024
02:14:03,560 --> 02:14:05,740
because it's pretty.
I know another guy got a color to it,

3025
02:14:05,770 --> 02:14:07,530
like was it a club day?
Well,

3026
02:14:07,531 --> 02:14:11,490
A guy who was into it as a club drug,
he got addicted to it and came out here.

3027
02:14:12,380 --> 02:14:15,280
A buddy of mine took him out here to 
rehab.

3028
02:14:15,281 --> 02:14:15,930
He was a fighter.

3029
02:14:16,260 --> 02:14:18,750
Took him out to a.
There's a place in thousand oaks.

3030
02:14:18,751 --> 02:14:23,751
It's a rehab place that's um,
that specializes or did specialize in 

3031
02:14:24,211 --> 02:14:29,211
the early two thousands,
specialize in ketamine and he wound up 

3032
02:14:29,211 --> 02:14:32,560
dying from it.
He died from withdrawal or overdose,

3033
02:14:32,640 --> 02:14:34,950
drug overdose,
whatever kind of drug.

3034
02:14:35,100 --> 02:14:39,150
Who knows if it was ketamine or a bunch 
of other things with ketamine.

3035
02:14:39,151 --> 02:14:41,850
But he had a real ketamine problem.
So ketamine,

3036
02:14:41,851 --> 02:14:44,960
like recreationally,
I didn't know to.

3037
02:14:45,060 --> 02:14:46,240
I wouldn't.
It was like,

3038
02:14:46,290 --> 02:14:49,410
you can't fucking trip [inaudible].
I wouldn't want it.

3039
02:14:49,411 --> 02:14:50,220
It's like,
what do you want to do?

3040
02:14:50,221 --> 02:14:52,590
Shrooms every day.
some people would,

3041
02:14:52,950 --> 02:14:54,550
but it's like everything else.
Like,

3042
02:14:54,551 --> 02:14:56,640
you know,
should you be able to get a tattoo?

3043
02:14:56,700 --> 02:14:57,600
Yeah,
of course.

3044
02:14:57,710 --> 02:15:02,710
Well,
some people want a tattoo every part of 

3045
02:15:02,710 --> 02:15:02,710
their body,
including their eyeballs.

3046
02:15:02,710 --> 02:15:02,710
Okay.
Well that's not me,

3047
02:15:02,710 --> 02:15:03,560
but yeah,
it,

3048
02:15:03,570 --> 02:15:06,060
as long as I can say I want to have a 
sleeve.

3049
02:15:06,300 --> 02:15:11,300
I can't stop some guy from turning his 
eyeballs into towed from thex man or 

3050
02:15:11,300 --> 02:15:15,561
whatever the fuck he's doing.
His name wasn't towed or something like 

3051
02:15:15,561 --> 02:15:17,340
that.
Frog fuck's his name of wolverine.

3052
02:15:17,910 --> 02:15:22,910
The froggy guy.
I don't think there was a frog and 

3053
02:15:22,910 --> 02:15:22,910
eczema.
What was he?

3054
02:15:22,910 --> 02:15:24,120
The guy With the fucking tail?
Nightcrawler.

3055
02:15:24,780 --> 02:15:29,780
Another.
There was nightcrawler and there was 

3056
02:15:29,780 --> 02:15:29,780
another guy that was like a toad.
Whatever.

3057
02:15:29,780 --> 02:15:34,670
You know what I'm saying?
It's crazy to wes borland looking black 

3058
02:15:34,670 --> 02:15:34,670
eyes.
I wouldn't,

3059
02:15:34,670 --> 02:15:35,820
I have,
would have no interest in doing this.

3060
02:15:35,850 --> 02:15:38,730
I would like to do it a little.
Is that a different one?

3061
02:15:38,731 --> 02:15:41,700
Was that one?
That's a different one.

3062
02:15:42,980 --> 02:15:45,210
So that's not,
that's not the frog.

3063
02:15:45,280 --> 02:15:46,890
That's not the one I was talking about.
Well,

3064
02:15:46,891 --> 02:15:49,560
who the fuck is that?
That's the frog.

3065
02:15:49,561 --> 02:15:51,110
I was talking about the.
Oh,

3066
02:15:51,120 --> 02:15:53,520
you're talking about somebody else got a
guy who's up there.

3067
02:15:54,120 --> 02:15:56,040
The other guY is the guy with that guy 
right there.

3068
02:15:56,100 --> 02:15:57,630
The guy to the left of that.
The other guy.

3069
02:15:58,020 --> 02:15:58,950
That guy.
Yeah.

3070
02:15:59,670 --> 02:16:00,180
Oh,
all right.

3071
02:16:00,181 --> 02:16:01,500
yeah,
that's what he looked like.

3072
02:16:01,900 --> 02:16:02,970
All right.
Whatever.

3073
02:16:03,180 --> 02:16:04,020
um,
yeah,

3074
02:16:04,021 --> 02:16:06,720
I don't,
I couldn't imagine doing it every.

3075
02:16:06,721 --> 02:16:09,810
It was pleasant but it wasn't that 
pleasant because the hangovers.

3076
02:16:09,811 --> 02:16:13,200
Not like I hate that fucking feeling 
coming out of anesthesia.

3077
02:16:13,710 --> 02:16:18,710
Like I had a septum surgery and I'm the 
guy didn't take out enough shit,

3078
02:16:19,081 --> 02:16:21,960
but that's a whole other thing.
But when I came out of it,

3079
02:16:22,890 --> 02:16:26,160
um,
it was in New York like a nine years ago

3080
02:16:26,220 --> 02:16:30,010
when I came out of it,
it was the fucking worst feeling

3081
02:16:30,190 --> 02:16:33,070
coming out of anesthesia and I couldn't 
breathe.

3082
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:35,120
I was like,
can I please get some water?

3083
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:37,270
And she was like,
we can't give you water.

3084
02:16:37,271 --> 02:16:39,060
So it's that thing where they're like,
mr ron investment,

3085
02:16:39,061 --> 02:16:42,550
it's just like this jarring fucking 
thing or they're trying to wake you up.

3086
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:43,930
And I was like,
please.

3087
02:16:43,931 --> 02:16:45,250
And she's like,
I'm giving you an ice cube.

3088
02:16:45,251 --> 02:16:48,520
She gave me an ice cube,
I hocked up a fucking blood pellet.

3089
02:16:49,150 --> 02:16:49,720
That was like,
well,

3090
02:16:49,721 --> 02:16:53,040
what if I hadn't asked for that shit?
Like I couldn't.

3091
02:16:53,100 --> 02:16:54,460
It was dangerous.
Um,

3092
02:16:54,880 --> 02:16:57,490
so You had swallowed like clot 
basically.

3093
02:16:57,491 --> 02:16:59,170
Yeah.
In a clot,

3094
02:16:59,830 --> 02:17:04,830
like blood booger was pictures on 
twitter after I got my deviated septum 

3095
02:17:05,261 --> 02:17:10,261
done while I was blowing out these 
fucking silver dollar size hunks of 

3096
02:17:10,261 --> 02:17:10,800
blood and bulger.
Ooh,

3097
02:17:11,150 --> 02:17:12,640
you got enough meat.
They guy didn't taken enough.

3098
02:17:12,641 --> 02:17:13,210
Meet up.
Yeah,

3099
02:17:13,211 --> 02:17:14,200
my guy was awesome.

3100
02:17:14,200 --> 02:17:16,470
He did a great job.
I almost want to get it again.

3101
02:17:16,510 --> 02:17:17,470
Get it again.
All right,

3102
02:17:17,620 --> 02:17:22,620
I love it man.
Now that I've come out of the fucking 

3103
02:17:22,620 --> 02:17:22,620
ketamine,
maybe I can double up having nose,

3104
02:17:22,620 --> 02:17:27,120
nose breathing,
being able to breathe through my nose 

3105
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:27,970
that I didn't get that.
So it was like 40 or 39.

3106
02:17:27,971 --> 02:17:30,490
I think I had it.
I still can't really breathe that in one

3107
02:17:30,491 --> 02:17:32,470
of my.
Yeah.

3108
02:17:33,820 --> 02:17:38,820
For me it's magic.
Can you imagine the kind of shape I'd 

3109
02:17:38,820 --> 02:17:38,820
been fired.
I'm terrified.

3110
02:17:38,820 --> 02:17:43,580
Fucking fucking guy.
You guys got to know what to do.

3111
02:17:44,170 --> 02:17:49,170
Well,
it's just nice to be able to breathe 

3112
02:17:49,170 --> 02:17:49,180
just to be able to breathe in your nose 
with your mouth closed.

3113
02:17:49,181 --> 02:17:50,960
That was a mouth breather most of my 
life,

3114
02:17:51,350 --> 02:17:55,060
but I apparently it's not an easy 
surgery and some people just,

3115
02:17:55,061 --> 02:17:57,130
it doesn't work right on them,
you know?

3116
02:17:57,130 --> 02:18:02,130
And some people grow back.
That's the other thing I heard you goes 

3117
02:18:02,130 --> 02:18:05,890
back to it.
I've heard it just repeats.

3118
02:18:06,040 --> 02:18:07,750
Know mine hasn't.
Okay.

3119
02:18:07,800 --> 02:18:10,030
Milo on seven years,
so it's amazing.

3120
02:18:10,240 --> 02:18:10,700
Yeah.
They,

3121
02:18:10,750 --> 02:18:15,750
they trim your turbinates.
I think they're called those big bones 

3122
02:18:15,750 --> 02:18:17,200
in there and they also cut out a lot of 
calcified blood on me.

3123
02:18:17,590 --> 02:18:18,540
Oh really?
Yeah,

3124
02:18:18,580 --> 02:18:23,410
mine was all like they.
There was like an extra that goes like I

3125
02:18:23,411 --> 02:18:26,110
don't think you need anything,
and then he showed he did like the x ray

3126
02:18:26,590 --> 02:18:31,590
and it.
There was so much like cartilage or 

3127
02:18:31,590 --> 02:18:33,970
whatever it was.
It was like it was cinnamon buns to fit.

3128
02:18:34,070 --> 02:18:36,070
Oh god.
So I guess he took that uP,

3129
02:18:36,071 --> 02:18:40,570
but he didn't take out enough shit.
They say that there's a large percentage

3130
02:18:40,571 --> 02:18:45,571
of people that deal with block septums 
that it's super confident because your 

3131
02:18:45,571 --> 02:18:45,880
nose is so fragile.

3132
02:18:46,180 --> 02:18:51,180
You whacked it on a door and all of a 
sudden it's bent and now you don't 

3133
02:18:51,180 --> 02:18:51,180
breathe right for the rest of your life.
So you get an operation.

3134
02:18:51,360 --> 02:18:56,360
The I've heard whether it's true or not,
but like a lot of it has to do with 

3135
02:18:56,360 --> 02:18:56,980
inbreeding.
I really have.

3136
02:18:57,070 --> 02:19:02,070
I've heard the jewish people and irish 
people have fucked up noses from 

3137
02:19:02,070 --> 02:19:02,070
inbreeding.
Really?

3138
02:19:02,070 --> 02:19:03,410
Where'd you read that?
In fucking on reddit,

3139
02:19:03,411 --> 02:19:06,330
bro.
Where do you think I bucket or it?

3140
02:19:07,360 --> 02:19:12,360
Well,
you know how fighters get cauliflower 

3141
02:19:12,360 --> 02:19:12,360
ear?
Yeah,

3142
02:19:12,360 --> 02:19:12,360
rough.
They get that with their nose as well.

3143
02:19:13,150 --> 02:19:15,000
You get it with your nose,
the inside of your nose.

3144
02:19:15,010 --> 02:19:20,010
Yeah.
The inside is soft tissue inside your 

3145
02:19:20,010 --> 02:19:22,021
nose,
bleeds and swells and fills with blood 

3146
02:19:22,021 --> 02:19:24,301
and that blood hardens and calcifies and
there's nothing you can kind of get in 

3147
02:19:24,301 --> 02:19:28,021
there and scrape it out.
Got to get an operation if you don't do 

3148
02:19:28,021 --> 02:19:28,021
anything for cauliflower ear.
Yeah,

3149
02:19:28,021 --> 02:19:28,760
yeah.
The cut,

3150
02:19:28,761 --> 02:19:33,761
the cut the ear,
they flay it open and then they scrape 

3151
02:19:33,761 --> 02:19:37,100
out all the calcification and stitch it 
right by the ear.

3152
02:19:37,220 --> 02:19:42,220
Yeah.
It's just blood that becomes calcified 

3153
02:19:42,220 --> 02:19:45,131
when blood leaks,
like when you have breaks in the blood 

3154
02:19:45,131 --> 02:19:46,790
vessels apparently,
and it's under the surface of the skin.

3155
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:52,000
It swells up,
like fills up with blood and then that 

3156
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:52,070
blood hardens and becomes like calcium.

3157
02:19:52,640 --> 02:19:53,590
I,
uh,

3158
02:19:53,690 --> 02:19:58,690
someone I know was telling me that they 
woke up with vertigo and it turned out,

3159
02:20:03,060 --> 02:20:08,060
um,
because a friend of hers had had it for 

3160
02:20:08,060 --> 02:20:08,060
months and they go,
yeah,

3161
02:20:08,060 --> 02:20:11,510
it turned out it was just a piece of 
dust in my inner ear.

3162
02:20:12,320 --> 02:20:15,110
So basicaLly if you ever wake up with 
vertigo,

3163
02:20:15,140 --> 02:20:20,140
one of the ways you get rid of it is 
literally like trying to get water out 

3164
02:20:20,140 --> 02:20:23,591
of your head.
You're trying to just jar the dust or 

3165
02:20:23,591 --> 02:20:24,620
whatever it is.
I'm like somersaults,

3166
02:20:24,621 --> 02:20:27,140
fucking laying on your side.
I swear to god they was like,

3167
02:20:27,170 --> 02:20:29,840
somersaults is one of the cures.
Um,

3168
02:20:30,140 --> 02:20:33,410
so if anyone wakes up with vertigo,
get to.

3169
02:20:33,880 --> 02:20:37,000
Was it that your ears control your 
balance?

3170
02:20:37,240 --> 02:20:42,240
Like some of her nose,
your ears and your balance are 

3171
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:42,240
connected.
Yeah.

3172
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:42,340
And your nose and your taste buds are 
connected.

3173
02:20:42,341 --> 02:20:43,510
Yeah.
Yeah.

3174
02:20:43,540 --> 02:20:46,430
Fuck is going on with the human design.
What a shit design.

3175
02:20:46,431 --> 02:20:48,690
And you're on the outside.
Yeah.

3176
02:20:48,820 --> 02:20:50,770
And every time.
No god you come,

3177
02:20:50,771 --> 02:20:52,570
you can make a person.
Yeah,

3178
02:20:52,810 --> 02:20:54,340
it's ridiculous.
It's too wild.

3179
02:20:54,430 --> 02:20:56,220
It's ridiculous.
Trick.

3180
02:20:56,620 --> 02:20:59,230
Trick us.
Yes.

3181
02:20:59,231 --> 02:20:59,890
So,
uh,

3182
02:21:00,130 --> 02:21:01,360
so yeah,
tricks.

3183
02:21:02,440 --> 02:21:03,520
So I'm,
look,

3184
02:21:03,521 --> 02:21:05,710
man,
I'm happy to hear that.

3185
02:21:05,711 --> 02:21:07,390
You know,
this is really working for you.

3186
02:21:07,450 --> 02:21:08,700
Yeah.
I'm still not.

3187
02:21:08,970 --> 02:21:13,970
I think I'm still not.
I'm hoping that I have maYbe 30 more 

3188
02:21:13,970 --> 02:21:18,081
percent upside to go more room.
I think it with the ssri stuff like once

3189
02:21:19,201 --> 02:21:21,540
then completely dissipates.
Yeah.

3190
02:21:22,620 --> 02:21:27,620
But I'm like,
it's more enjoyAble from the pov than it

3191
02:21:28,951 --> 02:21:33,951
was.
Would you recommend this to other 

3192
02:21:33,951 --> 02:21:33,951
people?
Do you recommend?

3193
02:21:33,951 --> 02:21:34,430
I wouldn't,
you know,

3194
02:21:34,770 --> 02:21:36,000
recommending a medical treatment.
It's,

3195
02:21:36,070 --> 02:21:41,070
it's personal,
but if you feel like all I can tell you 

3196
02:21:41,070 --> 02:21:43,400
is I tried a bunch of shit and it's.
And it's true.

3197
02:21:43,530 --> 02:21:45,930
The reason they do ketamine,
there's another one called tms,

3198
02:21:45,931 --> 02:21:50,931
which is the magnetic one.
There's a guy in chicago who does both 

3199
02:21:50,931 --> 02:21:51,460
at the same time cheats us prices guys.
A mad man.

3200
02:21:51,570 --> 02:21:55,180
Fuck You.
Trying to do like a superman and uh,

3201
02:21:55,260 --> 02:21:57,060
he might've.
So Yeah.

3202
02:21:57,290 --> 02:21:57,810
So,
uh,

3203
02:21:57,930 --> 02:22:01,080
you're the doctor.
I'm so you.

3204
02:22:02,220 --> 02:22:02,880
Yeah,
I,

3205
02:22:03,070 --> 02:22:03,630
I,
yeah,

3206
02:22:03,631 --> 02:22:06,150
there's a bunch of shit and it's like if
you're just sick of it,

3207
02:22:07,110 --> 02:22:09,090
I was just sick enough of it that I was 
like,

3208
02:22:09,150 --> 02:22:14,150
I don't name the price named the 
hardship because there's nothing.

3209
02:22:15,330 --> 02:22:16,590
I'm just sick of it.
Well,

3210
02:22:16,620 --> 02:22:18,330
you know,
kudos to you for keeping.

3211
02:22:18,600 --> 02:22:23,600
Keep searching.
The transcranial magnetic stimulation is

3212
02:22:24,331 --> 02:22:28,380
covered by some.
With magnets on your head.

3213
02:22:28,440 --> 02:22:30,120
Yes.
And they don't know how it works,

3214
02:22:30,660 --> 02:22:33,540
but they got it.
And I was on a show the other night,

3215
02:22:33,541 --> 02:22:36,330
by the way,
it was like a science show,

3216
02:22:36,360 --> 02:22:41,360
science slash comedy show,
like the panelists that were scientists 

3217
02:22:41,360 --> 02:22:43,320
panels over comics.
A woman on the panel,

3218
02:22:44,190 --> 02:22:45,360
um,
has,

3219
02:22:45,660 --> 02:22:50,660
she's involved in a magnet thing that 
increases people's sex drive for ever 

3220
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:54,720
fucking chicks.
Yeah.

3221
02:22:55,560 --> 02:22:57,930
Shoot magnets and your way.
Hornier.

3222
02:22:57,970 --> 02:22:59,920
And I was like,
do you think who?

3223
02:23:00,240 --> 02:23:02,700
But I said,
I don't think men need it.

3224
02:23:02,880 --> 02:23:04,950
Right?
Because the judge fuck your life.

3225
02:23:05,420 --> 02:23:06,880
The idea is you give it to women.
Yeah.

3226
02:23:06,930 --> 02:23:09,150
Like it's a spanish fly and magnet 
basically.

3227
02:23:09,151 --> 02:23:10,500
Yeah.
So while you check is asleep,

3228
02:23:10,740 --> 02:23:15,740
he put a fucking kitchen magnets out,
joe people online that was saying they 

3229
02:23:16,711 --> 02:23:17,790
can make it at home.
Not the,

3230
02:23:17,850 --> 02:23:20,240
not the sex one,
but the transcranial one.

3231
02:23:20,280 --> 02:23:25,280
But um,
well there's been all sorts of magnetic 

3232
02:23:25,280 --> 02:23:25,280
pulse to ease depression.
Yeah.

3233
02:23:25,640 --> 02:23:26,790
Wow.
Yeah.

3234
02:23:26,791 --> 02:23:27,390
What does It say?

3235
02:23:29,100 --> 02:23:34,100
Noninvasive procedure to help fight 
depression called transcranial magnetic 

3236
02:23:34,100 --> 02:23:38,031
stimulation or tms uses magnetic pulse 
to stimulate brain cells that control 

3237
02:23:38,031 --> 02:23:43,011
moot,
but they use that transcranial 

3238
02:23:43,011 --> 02:23:43,011
stimulation for a lot of different shit.
Right?

3239
02:23:43,270 --> 02:23:46,500
There Was a,
not magnetics but electric.

3240
02:23:46,750 --> 02:23:51,750
They were.
They had these electrodes they were 

3241
02:23:51,750 --> 02:23:51,750
attaching to people's brains that helped
them learn shit quicker.

3242
02:23:51,900 --> 02:23:56,900
There's all sorts of weird little hacks 
that you can use that helps stimulate 

3243
02:23:56,900 --> 02:23:59,400
little areas of the brain that they 
covered on radio lab.

3244
02:23:59,401 --> 02:24:04,401
There was a radio lab episode about this
woman who went through a sniper school 

3245
02:24:04,401 --> 02:24:05,220
tests when I heard that one.
you see that one?

3246
02:24:05,440 --> 02:24:06,660
Yeah.
That one was a main.

3247
02:24:06,690 --> 02:24:11,690
Or listen to that one.
That one was amazing because she did it 

3248
02:24:11,690 --> 02:24:11,690
and then she did it the second time and 
she's like,

3249
02:24:11,690 --> 02:24:12,860
everything was in slow motion.
I feel.

3250
02:24:12,900 --> 02:24:15,470
Felt like it only took five minutes and 
it was 20 minutes later,

3251
02:24:15,560 --> 02:24:18,610
the eight.
A zone the zone now.

3252
02:24:18,870 --> 02:24:20,350
so,
uh,

3253
02:24:20,740 --> 02:24:21,910
it's amazing.
Yeah.

3254
02:24:22,290 --> 02:24:27,290
I love this.
I love that there's so many people 

3255
02:24:27,290 --> 02:24:29,301
working on all these different ways to 
improve the way the brain functions and 

3256
02:24:29,301 --> 02:24:29,310
they're kind of still in this infancy 
with it.

3257
02:24:29,311 --> 02:24:31,550
They're fucking with it and adding 
pills.

3258
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:34,370
I'm grateful for the shit they've done 
so far.

3259
02:24:34,371 --> 02:24:36,800
It's like fucking thank you.
Even for the pills that didn't work.

3260
02:24:37,600 --> 02:24:38,860
Trying.
Yeah.

3261
02:24:38,900 --> 02:24:42,320
That's really cool.
I've never had a depression issue.

3262
02:24:42,321 --> 02:24:47,321
I don't think.
I mean I think I might've when I was 

3263
02:24:47,321 --> 02:24:47,321
really young,
but I don't have it.

3264
02:24:47,321 --> 02:24:48,850
I definitely don't have it now,
but I,

3265
02:24:48,851 --> 02:24:53,851
I sympathize with it and I know a lot of
people who have had it and I know a lot 

3266
02:24:53,851 --> 02:24:55,490
of people have had it and they've come 
back and they're much better.

3267
02:24:55,510 --> 02:24:56,330
You know,
our fears.

3268
02:24:56,331 --> 02:25:01,331
One that I always point to ari was 
severely depressed at one point in time 

3269
02:25:01,331 --> 02:25:02,720
and you know,
and now he's just amazing.

3270
02:25:02,960 --> 02:25:04,340
He's happiest fucker.
I know.

3271
02:25:04,550 --> 02:25:07,070
From what terms you think that a lot to 
do with it.

3272
02:25:07,071 --> 02:25:10,640
Success had a lot to do with it or he's 
really successful now and you know,

3273
02:25:10,641 --> 02:25:12,290
he doesn't feel like he's on the outside
anymore.

3274
02:25:12,291 --> 02:25:13,970
He's not,
he felt like,

3275
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,280
I think for awhile like that he wasn't 
being recognized,

3276
02:25:16,460 --> 02:25:18,470
he was being recognized by us,
you know,

3277
02:25:18,471 --> 02:25:23,471
like all of our friends and like crowds 
would laugh at them but the industry 

3278
02:25:23,471 --> 02:25:24,070
doesn't take them or he wasn't.

3279
02:25:24,530 --> 02:25:27,020
YeAh,
I had another brain thing over two days.

3280
02:25:27,260 --> 02:25:29,270
I think it was earlier this week,
um,

3281
02:25:29,750 --> 02:25:34,750
where one day I was like,
fucking no one cares about you and the 

3282
02:25:34,750 --> 02:25:37,820
next day I like,
it was a professional gripe,

3283
02:25:37,821 --> 02:25:38,680
warm legacy field,
getting,

3284
02:25:38,710 --> 02:25:43,710
doing good enough it to all that shit.
And then the next day I had the same 

3285
02:25:43,710 --> 02:25:45,350
thought and then it was followed by like
will then fight,

3286
02:25:45,890 --> 02:25:46,580
you know what I mean?
Like,

3287
02:25:47,530 --> 02:25:49,030
yeah,
like yeah,

3288
02:25:49,080 --> 02:25:50,810
it was like then fucking do something 
about it.

3289
02:25:50,840 --> 02:25:52,790
Whereas the day before I was just like 
hopeless.

3290
02:25:52,810 --> 02:25:57,810
Like that's the thing is like one of the
depression thinks just like learned 

3291
02:25:57,810 --> 02:26:01,061
helplessness is a sin.
They think that was one of the things 

3292
02:26:01,061 --> 02:26:03,890
that like that was a behavioral thing 
where it's like you have to like when,

3293
02:26:04,340 --> 02:26:07,520
when mice couldn't,
when they realized they couldn't get out

3294
02:26:07,521 --> 02:26:09,080
of a box,
they just stopped trying,

3295
02:26:10,010 --> 02:26:15,010
but then there were certain meds that 
they gave I think a chemical to that 

3296
02:26:15,010 --> 02:26:15,010
would keep,
that would like just fight,

3297
02:26:15,010 --> 02:26:15,090
fight,
fight,

3298
02:26:15,270 --> 02:26:17,350
fight until he died.
but they.

3299
02:26:17,390 --> 02:26:19,070
But that was the thing of like,
okay,

3300
02:26:19,250 --> 02:26:21,020
like I wasn't getting out a month ago.

3301
02:26:21,720 --> 02:26:25,000
That learned vIctim mentality is that 
that's a,

3302
02:26:25,001 --> 02:26:30,001
a groove that's like carved in people 
and some people it's become so 

3303
02:26:30,001 --> 02:26:30,760
prominent.
Yeah.

3304
02:26:30,930 --> 02:26:33,330
They just automatically drop right into 
that.

3305
02:26:33,331 --> 02:26:34,630
And then they're a victim.
Yeah.

3306
02:26:34,650 --> 02:26:36,970
And they search for that and then they 
use it.

3307
02:26:36,971 --> 02:26:39,520
Look for situations.
I also use it in arguments,

3308
02:26:39,540 --> 02:26:41,550
like they become a victim in the 
argument.

3309
02:26:42,060 --> 02:26:45,330
It's super common and it's so self 
defeating,

3310
02:26:45,331 --> 02:26:49,650
but so it's so enormous part of really 
weak thinking.

3311
02:26:49,780 --> 02:26:52,240
Yeah.
But having said that,

3312
02:26:52,540 --> 02:26:57,540
a lot of some of week thinking is as 
chemical problem is fucking diabetes.

3313
02:26:58,650 --> 02:26:59,460
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

3314
02:26:59,620 --> 02:27:00,280
Exactly.

3315
02:27:00,520 --> 02:27:03,010
And also,
not everybody has the same exact fuckIng

3316
02:27:03,011 --> 02:27:06,700
childhood and growing up experiences.
So your,

3317
02:27:06,701 --> 02:27:11,701
your formative experiences that you're 
having with it's shaping your 

3318
02:27:11,701 --> 02:27:14,431
personality,
what giant percentage of them are 

3319
02:27:14,431 --> 02:27:17,221
completely out of your control and how 
arrogant is it to assume that everybody 

3320
02:27:17,221 --> 02:27:19,180
had the experiences that you had.
So you've gotten through them.

3321
02:27:19,420 --> 02:27:24,420
Everybody else,
Henry Rollins needs to pull themselves 

3322
02:27:24,420 --> 02:27:24,420
up by their bootstraps and not fucking 
shoot themselves.

3323
02:27:24,420 --> 02:27:26,470
Like robin williams,
that pussy fucking pussy.

3324
02:27:26,500 --> 02:27:27,910
Yeah,
I mean that's the crazy.

3325
02:27:27,940 --> 02:27:29,170
Well that's like when people say it

3326
02:27:29,290 --> 02:27:30,390
like a,
a,

3327
02:27:30,400 --> 02:27:35,400
a depression is like a strength thing.
It's like if you're talking about mental

3328
02:27:35,501 --> 02:27:40,501
fortitude,
I've got a pretty good track record of 

3329
02:27:40,501 --> 02:27:44,311
like shit I've done.
and same with robin williams talking 

3330
02:27:44,311 --> 02:27:45,520
about fucking not easy.
What he's done.

3331
02:27:45,610 --> 02:27:48,010
Fucking write however many hours to 
stand up.

3332
02:27:48,040 --> 02:27:53,040
He stole a ton of stand up to be that 
good inactive to being just his recall 

3333
02:27:54,761 --> 02:27:58,270
was fucking a like.
He's got a good brain so he's not like a

3334
02:27:58,270 --> 02:27:58,890
week at

3335
02:27:58,920 --> 02:28:01,930
some things.
At least you know Mark Gordon,

3336
02:28:01,960 --> 02:28:03,820
who's a good friend of mine,
is a doctor.

3337
02:28:04,060 --> 02:28:08,600
He's an expert in traumatic brain injury
and recovery from traumatic brain injury

3338
02:28:09,010 --> 02:28:10,660
and one of the things that he talked 
about,

3339
02:28:10,661 --> 02:28:15,580
he actually wrote a paper about this,
about people that have gone through very

3340
02:28:15,581 --> 02:28:20,581
significant operations where they have 
been under anesthesia for long periods 

3341
02:28:20,581 --> 02:28:22,250
of time and had open heart.
That type of shit.

3342
02:28:22,550 --> 02:28:27,550
There's a large percentage of them that 
experience and pretty significant 

3343
02:28:27,550 --> 02:28:30,731
depression after it's over and they 
think it has to do with hormonal 

3344
02:28:30,731 --> 02:28:33,380
imbalances that occur after these 
traumatic.

3345
02:28:33,880 --> 02:28:34,480
Yeah.
That,

3346
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:38,450
but some people have like a kind of.
Seems like letterman had the opposite,

3347
02:28:39,230 --> 02:28:41,420
like he had heart surgery and was like a
new man.

3348
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:43,070
He was just appreciative and shit like 
that.

3349
02:28:43,130 --> 02:28:44,160
Well,
that's true too.

3350
02:28:44,180 --> 02:28:49,180
You know,
some people that go through these near 

3351
02:28:49,180 --> 02:28:49,220
la near death experiences and wakes them
up like they realize,

3352
02:28:49,221 --> 02:28:50,780
hey asshole,
this is almost over.

3353
02:28:50,781 --> 02:28:52,280
Maybe it's time to be nice to people.
Yeah.

3354
02:28:52,550 --> 02:28:54,230
Maybe appreciate,
smell the flowers.

3355
02:28:54,440 --> 02:28:59,440
You're fucking.
David letterman did go out and hug some 

3356
02:28:59,440 --> 02:28:59,440
folks,
you know?

3357
02:28:59,440 --> 02:28:59,440
Yeah.
That's.

3358
02:28:59,440 --> 02:29:00,740
He'd started taking antidepressants.
did he really?

3359
02:29:00,741 --> 02:29:02,600
Yeah,
he was on alec baldwin's podcast.

3360
02:29:02,601 --> 02:29:05,000
He talked about it like alec baldwin as 
a pilot,

3361
02:29:05,030 --> 02:29:07,280
baldwin hat.
He had a podcast.

3362
02:29:07,280 --> 02:29:10,280
I don't know if it came back.
That guy's got golden pipes,

3363
02:29:10,281 --> 02:29:12,480
first of all.
So that's the way he talks.

3364
02:29:12,481 --> 02:29:15,020
A joy what you're saying.
This is alec baldwin.

3365
02:29:15,120 --> 02:29:17,960
I'm like,
it's a joy to listen to that puck.

3366
02:29:18,050 --> 02:29:19,130
That's an easy hour,
right?

3367
02:29:19,131 --> 02:29:23,380
There's ego.
It was fucking try to fucking like,

3368
02:29:23,390 --> 02:29:25,850
don't pay attention to that part.
You'll listen to fucking golden.

3369
02:29:25,851 --> 02:29:28,460
But I'll take an ego with pipes like 
that.

3370
02:29:28,790 --> 02:29:30,010
What have you have?
Puffer razzi.

3371
02:29:30,020 --> 02:29:31,160
Would you hold a grudge?
Yeah,

3372
02:29:31,310 --> 02:29:36,310
I think that's what made him,
it was on a public radio station in New 

3373
02:29:36,310 --> 02:29:36,500
York and they were like,
you can't be saying faggot and all that,

3374
02:29:37,050 --> 02:29:37,980
like,
sorry man,

3375
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:41,990
I can't say I can't do it.
But uh,

3376
02:29:42,050 --> 02:29:43,260
but yeah,
so he was talking about on,

3377
02:29:43,320 --> 02:29:46,310
on,
on alex pod podcast and it was like,

3378
02:29:46,790 --> 02:29:51,790
he went on him shortly after that.
I think he had shingles too,

3379
02:29:53,180 --> 02:29:54,260
and he was just miserable.

3380
02:29:54,900 --> 02:29:59,900
Uh,
and they were like going in and he's 

3381
02:29:59,900 --> 02:29:59,900
like,
really?

3382
02:29:59,900 --> 02:29:59,900
And he said like,
it's,

3383
02:29:59,900 --> 02:30:00,080
I don't know what the analogy was,
but he's like,

3384
02:30:00,590 --> 02:30:05,590
it was just like,
it was like I'd clumpy hair that I 

3385
02:30:05,590 --> 02:30:05,960
couldn't get a comb through and now I 
could get the comfort with or something.

3386
02:30:05,961 --> 02:30:07,760
I don't remember what the,
but some similar to that,

3387
02:30:07,761 --> 02:30:10,100
but he's kind of chubby and it doesn't 
go.

3388
02:30:10,101 --> 02:30:12,230
you exercises and I bet he doesn't eat 
letterman.

3389
02:30:12,500 --> 02:30:13,250
No,
no.

3390
02:30:13,251 --> 02:30:15,200
I'm taLking about letterman,
letterman,

3391
02:30:15,230 --> 02:30:17,440
letterman would talked about it.
Ios podcast,

3392
02:30:17,900 --> 02:30:20,420
not on antidepressants.
These podcasts.

3393
02:30:20,450 --> 02:30:21,060
Oh,
okay.

3394
02:30:21,430 --> 02:30:22,730
Well,
letterman also,

3395
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,310
this is post open heart surgery.
Yeah,

3396
02:30:25,370 --> 02:30:29,150
that makes sense.
But I'd heard stories about him where he

3397
02:30:29,151 --> 02:30:29,810
was,
you know,

3398
02:30:29,811 --> 02:30:32,160
I'd hear stories where he wouldn't be 
happy with the monologue.

3399
02:30:32,161 --> 02:30:33,770
And he used to be banging his head 
against the wall.

3400
02:30:33,830 --> 02:30:34,640
Yeah,
I heard that too.

3401
02:30:34,640 --> 02:30:36,740
I heard that from my friend who's his 
assistant.

3402
02:30:37,040 --> 02:30:39,290
Yeah.
He fucking hated everything he did.

3403
02:30:39,430 --> 02:30:41,420
and that's one of the reasons why he was
the best.

3404
02:30:41,500 --> 02:30:42,770
Yeah.
It's just the way it is.

3405
02:30:42,800 --> 02:30:43,790
Yeah,
he would.

3406
02:30:43,850 --> 02:30:45,170
Yeah.
There's a,

3407
02:30:45,410 --> 02:30:46,970
there was a story in that,
uh,

3408
02:30:47,780 --> 02:30:52,780
in that late night book,
the late shift that I think it was in 

3409
02:30:52,780 --> 02:30:55,391
the book,
but Peter Le sally had a big house in 

3410
02:30:55,391 --> 02:30:58,631
malibu and he was the exec producer of 
the tonight show and like an exec 

3411
02:31:00,351 --> 02:31:05,351
producer on late night with david 
letterman and he became one on the new 

3412
02:31:05,351 --> 02:31:05,351
one too,
but,

3413
02:31:05,351 --> 02:31:08,860
so he was sort of like,
letterman's go between for letter for 

3414
02:31:08,860 --> 02:31:09,240
uh,
for johnny and uh,

3415
02:31:09,560 --> 02:31:11,090
he had a beautiful rooms like,
man,

3416
02:31:11,091 --> 02:31:12,770
I could never have a house like this.
And he goes,

3417
02:31:13,160 --> 02:31:16,730
you make 10 times the money I make,
like you could totally.

3418
02:31:16,731 --> 02:31:17,540
And he's Like,
really?

3419
02:31:17,990 --> 02:31:22,990
Like,
it just never occurred to him that 

3420
02:31:22,990 --> 02:31:25,610
things were good and he could do well.
Another thing more.

3421
02:31:27,301 --> 02:31:29,820
I'm more apt to cry now as well in a 
good way.

3422
02:31:29,880 --> 02:31:32,610
Not like,
like I saw inside out and cried,

3423
02:31:33,690 --> 02:31:34,950
which isn't good.
Yeah.

3424
02:31:34,951 --> 02:31:35,730
Sweet.
but uh,

3425
02:31:36,210 --> 02:31:39,090
but like,
so you feel more?

3426
02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:39,350
Yeah.

3427
02:31:40,170 --> 02:31:41,090
Yes.
Wow.

3428
02:31:41,600 --> 02:31:42,870
Yeah.
So far

3429
02:31:43,960 --> 02:31:45,540
I'm happy for you to get addicted and 
die.

3430
02:31:45,630 --> 02:31:50,630
I think that's awesome.
I'm happy for you coming on here and 

3431
02:31:50,630 --> 02:31:53,380
talking about it because it's fucking 
because the thing with therapy that it's

3432
02:31:53,381 --> 02:31:54,280
very,
first of all,

3433
02:31:54,281 --> 02:31:57,040
people don't know.
It's very hard to find a good therapist.

3434
02:31:57,041 --> 02:31:58,720
Like people are too quick to go,
like,

3435
02:31:58,721 --> 02:31:59,530
yeah,
they're fine.

3436
02:32:00,070 --> 02:32:05,070
You got to shop around which people 
don't realize and with the 

3437
02:32:05,070 --> 02:32:05,070
antidepressants you gotta shop around 
and if none of them work,

3438
02:32:05,070 --> 02:32:09,220
keep looking for other shit.
Like don't just go and you can't do it.

3439
02:32:10,060 --> 02:32:11,740
Um,
so.

3440
02:32:12,070 --> 02:32:13,360
So yeah.
But uh,

3441
02:32:14,020 --> 02:32:15,670
I look forward to the rest of my life,
jo.
