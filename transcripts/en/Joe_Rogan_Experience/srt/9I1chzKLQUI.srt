00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,740
You're a free man. Look at you and
all right. You're a bad motherfucker.

53
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,800
Dick Sling and video game controller
and you're out there a free man.

54
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,500
After 20 years of servitude,

55
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,910
you worked for a epic games for a
fuck load of time. I met you there.

56
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,570
Jesus Christ was like five years old.
It was a long time ago.

57
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:41,170
You were a young lad running a big
company like that I was having in my first

58
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:43,750
marriage back then too.
You got a different thing going on,

59
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:48,460
but it's a good way if you're driving
a Lamborghini or out of Raleigh,

60
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,470
you first visited, it was a
viper. Oh, that's right. And
it was fucking terrifying.

61
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,280
Those are terrifying.

62
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,470
Are you talk about like a poor Paul
Walker and though the pores career,

63
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:01,300
I mean that's car was squirrely, has held
to like really fast in a straight line.

64
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,030
Well those cars were super fun,
those vipers.

65
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:07,450
But the idea behind it was
the most ridiculous thing
ever. No anti lock brakes.

66
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,080
Yup. No traction control 500
fucking horse by the earlier ones.

67
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,830
And if you weren't careful getting
out, you would burn your leg. Yeah.

68
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,730
Oh that's a side pipe. And then to add
insult to injury, the top of the car,

69
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,120
if it was the convertible,

70
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,720
you had to take an Allen wrench and
unscrew the thing and then get a friend to

71
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,850
help put, it wouldn't even
fit in the boot of the car.

72
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:27,940
You had to leave it at home. So I and
I used to live five minutes from epic.

73
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:32,140
I'd sit there on my second monitor and
I have the WRL doppler hub and a storm

74
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:33,940
was coming.
I'd have to like drive the car home.

75
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,800
Otherwise he'd be the Asshole
Stop Layla Guru. Right. So stupid.

76
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:42,550
You can't put the roof inside the car.
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

77
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:46,450
Dave Perry, he had one for awhile. We
were big on the viper for some reason.

78
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:48,420
And he told me the story,
went to dinner with like some,

79
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,300
some say gay executive and when
he was a younger developer and a,

80
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,370
he had the top off and this is Las and
like Laguna and it can never fucking

81
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:55,690
rains. Right. And uh,

82
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,480
he said it's just started pouring and
like he just walked home because he didn't

83
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:01,810
want BV and have the embarrassment of
driving the car or the SIG executive

84
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:04,300
seeing him the next day. He could
see he was starting to rust already.

85
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:07,700
He traded the Fucker, ran as fast as he
could before the waste actually hits.

86
00:05:07,701 --> 00:05:10,420
So somewhere out there, there's a guy who
wound up with Dave Perry's Rusty Viper.

87
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,200
It's probably worth a couple of bucks
because of that. Really Dave Perry.

88
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,880
But yeah, I mean it's a, I worked,

89
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:18,640
I started working with them
when I was 17 men and uh, I was,

90
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:23,770
I was emotionally like 12. That's
insane. Working for epic games.

91
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,150
It's 17. How old were you when I met
you? Uh, mid twenties, I think. Yeah.

92
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,530
That was way before gears when you guys
were just working on the tack of gears.

93
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:36,030
Yeah. Come in with Dunkin. Was it Duncan?
Trussell? I think it was Dunkin. You,

94
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,840
you played a the trolley. Good night.
Good Nights. Yeah. It was just there as a,

95
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,970
what's his name? Joey Diaz fucking
be asthma and uh, he's a, he's,

96
00:05:43,971 --> 00:05:45,490
he's good actually.
And uh,

97
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:48,760
we went to Jillian's and that was
like downtown and downtown. Dude.

98
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,540
The last time you visited Raleigh, even
since when you visited then versus now.

99
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:56,020
It's like night and day. Yeah. It's
like a mini Austin now. Really?

100
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:58,070
We have the hipster infection.
We've got fucking

101
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,750
food trucks. See if he could do
something about that. Dude will open.

102
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,250
I opened a restaurant right there.
Did you really? Yeah. With my partner.

103
00:06:05,251 --> 00:06:07,310
Is this a giant six
foot eight Irish fucker?

104
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,240
He used to bounce in Southie back before
south. He got gentrified. How old is he?

105
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,710
Uh, he's 43. Those guys don't last
long. Yeah. Yeah. Six foot eight. Well,

106
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:19,810
we're going to take one key man insurance.
Yeah. You got to keep that guy. Yeah.

107
00:06:19,811 --> 00:06:22,940
He's a, he's a, he's a rock star though.
He handled most of the day to day ops.

108
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:26,000
He's been in the restaurant business 25
years. One of my best friends and uh,

109
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:28,560
yeah, it's in a gentrifying
neighborhood, Italian comfort food.

110
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:32,870
It's called the station on person.
We were just there. I'm about,

111
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,300
I want to say like six
or seven months ago,

112
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,450
Duncan and I did a tour of North Carolina,
which is where he's from.

113
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:43,610
We did that and we did the, the mountain
joint. Yeah. Ashville, Ashville,

114
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,520
which is amazing. Yeah. It's beautiful
out there. But they hate the tourists.

115
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,000
They do, but they do for a reason. Yeah.
But the tourist bringing the money.

116
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,510
That's true. But when you
go to Asheville, my feeling,

117
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,310
and I don't want to
Romanticize it too much,

118
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,370
cause I really liked doing that with some
small towns. My feeling, it was like,

119
00:06:58,371 --> 00:07:01,880
oh my God, nobody knows about this. Like
this place is like at the perfect level.

120
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,200
Like the perfect amount of you can
walk around and it's like very little.

121
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:09,380
Like seediness. Even the homeless
people were pretty polite. Yeah.

122
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,680
Just a bunch of Weirdo. Even in
downtown Raleigh, you get to know him.

123
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:14,210
There's like,
oh there's the guy with the bags.

124
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:17,030
There's the guy with a cane who talked
to everybody and the ad actually become

125
00:07:17,031 --> 00:07:19,060
like friendly and shit and they don't.
Instead,

126
00:07:19,061 --> 00:07:21,650
they didn't like San Francisco where
they actually physically touch you fit.

127
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:24,860
San Francisco is one of the worst
spots ever. Fucking grab you man.

128
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,180
It's just like,
come on man,

129
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,900
we're coming off the freeway of in the
Uber on the way over and there's these

130
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:32,780
three d hipster looking dudes
playing music with a sign.

131
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,210
You need gas money to get home and home.

132
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:37,520
Of course they list is Portland
and I'm like, you know,

133
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:39,950
at least you're doing something for
it. Singing for your supper. Right.

134
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,690
Long drive me to come by. Rollie should
even made a comment. Yeah, we couldn't.

135
00:07:44,691 --> 00:07:48,330
We had a young and I had
to do, yeah, any time.

136
00:07:48,331 --> 00:07:51,170
And then we had a drive to
Asheville the next morning,

137
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,090
but it was really beautiful up there.

138
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,480
It's really the mountain ash Asheville's
beautiful. But it also has that like,

139
00:07:56,481 --> 00:07:59,600
feels like they took it like
a kit for like a hamlet,

140
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,380
like of a town to like put it together and
it's like, oh, the mountain vibe to it.

141
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,470
Like this Bavarian thing going
on. Yeah, it does. Right.

142
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:09,620
It's got this weird sort of,
it's just interesting.

143
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:13,910
What did you drive down the slopes where
they were reminded to be careful with

144
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:16,100
your brakes and there's like runoffs
for trucks and everything going down the

145
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:17,870
hills. Yeah. He has some
serious fucking hill.

146
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,150
You gotta be careful with that chat
is the mountains especially in the

147
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:23,210
wintertime, right? Yeah. Yeah.
It's beautiful out there.
It's fucking incredible.

148
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,680
Unbelievably gorgeous. Like
as we were driving up those
hills, it's like, wow dude,

149
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,320
I love it out there. You know, and
I've said this a million times,

150
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:33,790
the west coats is fucking fantastic. The
problem is the word got out, you know?

151
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,630
And if I get around to
starting a new game studio,

152
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:39,320
I pay a programmer of 75 80
grand in Raleigh, the he or
she can live like a king,

153
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,910
great house, a great schools. The
downtown's just growing exponentially.

154
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,970
And it's just a,
you know,

155
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,750
it has certain political issues
that have been in the news lately.

156
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:51,320
Get her done that, uh, that
those assholes all be voted out.

157
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:52,520
But I don't want to get
into too much of that.

158
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,010
It's too early for this bad stuff going
on there. Just, you know, GOP has got

159
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,590
lost their fucking mind,
like GOP making,

160
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:00,980
trying to shut down all the abortion
clinics and all this crazy sure.

161
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,660
Old dudes now that's the problem.

162
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,150
Or an old white men are currently
terrified young men with balls become

163
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:09,270
libertarians and only the ones who
are trying to hide from the gay become

164
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:10,100
Republicans.

165
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,170
So you've got this weird thing where you
got old dudes and young guys that are

166
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:16,140
gay trying to pretend they're not
well and that's when you were pressed

167
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:18,360
something that much.
It bounces back five times.

168
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:23,640
People right now fucking screaming. Good.
I told you this fucking cock suckers.

169
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:24,660
A liberal dude.

170
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,480
Our fucking marriage has been in shambles
since they legalized gay marriage.

171
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:28,620
It's just been horrible for us.

172
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,820
Legalizing gay marriage fight.

173
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:37,470
I said to stop watching gay porn because
I felt too insecure about my abs. Smart.

174
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,960
You should be careful.
Really ruin your mind.

175
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,190
It's like doing acid one too many times,
you know that's out there.

176
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,850
You know those abs are out there and
you look at yourself when you go to the

177
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:49,040
bathroom, you're like, Shit.

178
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,200
The point where I'm in the car and
suddenly like I start feeling this little

179
00:09:52,201 --> 00:09:56,730
like Mirabelle right around here.
What are the abs you speak of?

180
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,020
I know to some crossfit or
something. The idea. Do you have,

181
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,850
what's your workout routine? Do you do
crossfit? I do kettle bells. No, no.

182
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:08,250
I don't go to a crossfit gym. Fucking
coffee to me. Yes. Very called to it.

183
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,480
Like my best friends into it.

184
00:10:09,481 --> 00:10:11,880
Not One of the reasons I love him is
because he doesn't talk about it all the

185
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:14,400
fucking time. I think
it's culty, but it's,

186
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,920
it seems to me to be a good thing to be
culty about if you're going to be called

187
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,680
[inaudible] health. Those people like
really motivated. I met a lot of them.

188
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:26,010
I've never met any of them
that espouse weird culty shit.

189
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,940
It's all just a fitness culty. I
had a friend of mine, dear friend,

190
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:33,330
but she's got hardcore into it and she's
like showing us how shredded her hands

191
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:37,170
are is like a badge. I'm like, that's
not the practice. Yeah, I saw some,

192
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,540
there's some photo shoot that
some woman did who's like,

193
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:43,250
I guess she's a NASCAR mechanic
or something. That's Chris.

194
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,800
That's Christmas Abbott. That's the
girl I've known her. I like, I know her.

195
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,110
She lives in Raleigh and she didn't want,

196
00:10:48,111 --> 00:10:51,640
you were talking about Tanya
was as my friend used to work.

197
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,050
She works at epic right now about to
have a baby actually and a great girl.

198
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,780
But um, she got so hard corner
crossfit and she was just was like, no,

199
00:10:57,781 --> 00:11:01,020
you can't wear gloves. You have
to suffer for your work. Yeah.

200
00:11:01,021 --> 00:11:04,740
There was a video of the fucking
crossfit founder or one of them, uh,

201
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:07,110
doing these kipping pull ups.
Like,

202
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,290
he's one of the head crossfit guys and
he's just mangles his hands and he's like

203
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,740
proud that his hands are like cut open
from all half the crossfit videos.

204
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:15,480
You look up a Christmas girls in it.

205
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:18,690
She's totally cool and she's like a
local celebrity and she's like the first

206
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:23,490
female to do a NASCAR pit, I believe.
A fucking body. That shit's ridiculous.

207
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,500
She's she shredded and you wouldn't
know it when you meet her like,

208
00:11:26,501 --> 00:11:28,260
like she's like a whole
celebrity in that whole scene.

209
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:32,070
Like she's totally chill and cool. You
mean in the crossfit seen? Yeah. Yeah.

210
00:11:32,071 --> 00:11:33,390
Well I found out about her on,

211
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:37,530
I think on mixed martial arts.com there
was a website about a thread on the

212
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:41,430
message board rather about her and
I'm like, yeah, that's a weird thing.

213
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:46,310
But that really strong muscular, pretty
girl like that. That's so you know,

214
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,860
if you've got to do is or any of that.
That's my thing about tattoos also. Right?

215
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,970
Like if you're going to do it, do
it. Like go on out. Right. Like

216
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,690
I say, I have a star on my butt for my
mom. You know, I'm just like all the way,

217
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,370
right? Mom, you always [inaudible]. I
mean, I got an [inaudible] state symbol,

218
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,320
my butt and that's my thing.

219
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:05,740
I just got two shitty ones that I got
when I was like 20 something and they're

220
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:08,730
flash and they weren't even
custom designed and like,
do I regret it? You know,

221
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,410
we were sitting, I was visiting with, uh,

222
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,250
my wife's family in Florida this summer
and uh, Destin, the old fun in La trip.

223
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:16,870
Right. And it was cool.
It was fun. But, uh,

224
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,620
Lawrence baby sister is 19 and she's just
getting into dragons now. And I'm like,

225
00:12:20,621 --> 00:12:23,260
and she looks at this Tattoo, this
Shitty Dragon Tattoo. I have my shoulder.

226
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:26,740
And she's like, did you just get that?
And I'm like, look at it. You know,

227
00:12:26,741 --> 00:12:29,860
it's like the old sailor anchor. It's
like bleeding. What is it? Let me say it,

228
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,870
a dragon date. It's just like, yeah,

229
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,390
this is just all elaborate trick to
get he beat to take your shirt off.

230
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,760
It's cute little gut. Two cute
little dragon. Yeah. But I,

231
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:46,400
I was bold 19 year old and I'm like, lacy,
I like dragons. Before it was cool, like,

232
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,790
oh, you know, she was wounded.

233
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,360
When was it cool to like
dragons now it's cool.

234
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,780
But it was always cool to like track
and just isn't dragons driving has been

235
00:12:55,781 --> 00:13:00,550
around admitting when I grew up that if
I was a dork and the dragons and things

236
00:13:00,551 --> 00:13:03,720
like that dude, it was not
cool for the cool kids. Yeah.

237
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,660
Well when I was in high school,

238
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:08,620
I remember someone was like shitting on
me because I read the Lord of the Rings,

239
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,100
you know, it was into the hobbit books.
I'm like, that's my, that's my point.

240
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:16,330
Exactly. So it's cool to be nerdy,
right? Yeah. When did that change? Uh,

241
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:21,100
about eight years ago. Video Games. Why?
What made it change? Uh, video games.

242
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,120
But you think it's a cultural thing?
It's like Big Bang theory, right?

243
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,620
Like if you get, like I tell people like,
yeah, I gotta go to comic con next week.

244
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:30,310
And everybody's like, I'm so fucking
envious of that. And I'm like, okay.

245
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:31,690
And like if you ever read a comic,

246
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:35,140
like do you know who half these people
are and a bump me out this year.

247
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:37,090
Have you ever gone? No, we may.

248
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:41,680
We saying the guy is saying
he's envious is just rather no,

249
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:42,810
he actually isn't actually,

250
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,030
people actually really want
to go to comicon because I
mean it's not just comics,

251
00:13:46,031 --> 00:13:47,860
it's video games.
It's pop culture.

252
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,220
In one minute you'll see like John Fev
Rhogam we'll go walking by then there's

253
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:54,220
like a person dressed up as Princess Leia.
That sounds like two things.

254
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:57,170
I want to avoid that stations you
want to stay here. But Joe, Joe,

255
00:13:57,171 --> 00:14:00,720
the thing is it's like, just get John
Hopper players. Dude. Just kidding.

256
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,180
The cost players are fucking amazing
these days. Like the amount of word they,

257
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,571
there's,

258
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:08,200
there are girls and guys who spent all
year working on an outfit and then just

259
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:11,410
show up and they let go like dry from
like Boise and sleep in their friend's

260
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:16,660
floor and ocean side. I've been there. I'm
not in the actual event itself. I went,

261
00:14:16,661 --> 00:14:21,020
we were there, uh, doing shows that
I'm a American comedy company. Yeah.

262
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,480
And I just was down there for the fun
of it, but we had to cut out early.

263
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,420
Just fucking a lot of fucking people,
man. It's, it's, it's madness.

264
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,700
It's still is just getting a hotel room,
getting a ticket.

265
00:14:30,701 --> 00:14:33,160
You have to have a good connection
through like Warner brothers or something

266
00:14:33,161 --> 00:14:35,770
like that. And we were only able
to be there. I mean, I love it.

267
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,820
I fucking live for it every year.

268
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:41,420
It's like everything I love in one place
and it's just very sweaty. And uh, we um,

269
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,580
had to leave early
cause my wife's, uh, uh,

270
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,210
one of her bridesmaids was actually
getting married back in Louisiana.

271
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,420
She's from New Orleans, so I
was like, damn it, I had to
miss out because you know,

272
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,920
you go to like the entertainment weekly
party there and it feels like prom.

273
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,280
It's just so many cool.

274
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:58,800
There's this whole like Josh Sweden
circle of people like Nate filling in and

275
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,850
all of them that just are who
these people are used to be.

276
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,460
Go from firefly and serenity man
and like Buffy and all that. Right.

277
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:08,270
You know the firefly and serenity.
What does that, what does that,

278
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:11,480
what the fuck are you talking about?
It's like you're not speaking my language.

279
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,910
This is only 24 hours in
the day you wear this.

280
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,710
How would you even know about these
things? Why would you allow him to answer?

281
00:15:17,711 --> 00:15:20,330
It's your memory to the point where you
think that another grown man would know

282
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:23,090
what the fuck you're talking about.
Shitting on Scifi classics right now.

283
00:15:23,091 --> 00:15:26,230
Firefly and serenity. I'm like
what dude? Watch them trust. No,

284
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,940
I've heard serenities Badass.
Yes. Ready? He's fantastic.

285
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:31,070
But most people are not going to know
what the fuck you're talking about was my

286
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:35,750
point. I actually no, I went
to the, the like my Scifi show.

287
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,860
Was it the uh, they were at the
premiere. I like a lot of the guys,

288
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,460
they played clips.
It's really great stuff,

289
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,560
but most people are not gonna know
what the fuck you're talking about. Oh,

290
00:15:42,561 --> 00:15:47,480
fair enough. You fucking, you guys
are so deep and I've heard a Buffy.

291
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,440
Well, I've, I have a whole like
there's like a 10 year rule where you,

292
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:56,770
anything that was like cool 10 years ago
you can reintroduce it and then people

293
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,700
act like it's new. Like
zombies, vampires, people like,

294
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,590
like things like if you go back
to like Buffy the vampire slayer,

295
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:07,340
who the fuck would have thought that
would become like as huge TV show and why

296
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,200
didn't they use the same Buffy magic buff?

297
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,080
These agent fucked up that deals
Kristy Swanson. Right? I don't know.

298
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,700
She's not as Buffy as she used to be.
I think it was probably the reason,

299
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,980
you know, they really look at
Luke Perry who's also in any,

300
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:21,560
that'd be creepy if you had
Luke Perry and that TV show.

301
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,690
Luke Perry was it a TV show because
his hair's not as straight anymore.

302
00:16:26,691 --> 00:16:28,130
It's kind of wick to the side.

303
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,030
Like a classic thing of 30 year
olds is high school students. Yeah.

304
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,040
That way we do like the dude's hairlines
like worst thing fucking nick Cage's

305
00:16:38,151 --> 00:16:41,630
and he's playing a high school kid that
don't buy it and he wasn't like a Tom

306
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:45,250
Cruise 30 either. Tom Cruise at 30,
looks like Tom Cruise at 20 minutes.

307
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,790
Very similar to Tom Cruise at 40,

308
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,470
which is very fucking similar to Tom
Cruise at 50. Now. It's a big difference.

309
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,600
This isn't vampirism going on there
or something like Cindy Crawford.

310
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:59,160
She was hot as fuck. She was dude, it said
Luke, that's that nineties look. Yeah,

311
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,290
that's right. He was in Buffy
the vampire slayer. Yeah.

312
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,340
That was not the vision that
Josh's originally wanted.

313
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:07,160
The studio of fucking total
in the director totally
changed what he wanted to do.

314
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:09,410
That's why he went on
to do Buffy as the show,

315
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:12,290
which wound up being like this
cold classic. Really like what it,

316
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,240
what was the difference between what
he wanted to do and what they want.

317
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:17,670
They want to do it campy and uh,
the name like Buffy the vampire slayer,

318
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:20,440
he went into being cheesy and
campy. Right. And so for the show,

319
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:24,440
the whole point of the show was that was
demons and vampires as a metaphor for

320
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:27,250
high school shit that people go through.
Right. She finally sleeps with their,

321
00:17:27,251 --> 00:17:29,630
her to crush angel and he
turns into a giant asshole.

322
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:34,550
You know what someone needs to do,
man, La Femme, Nikita style realistic,

323
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:39,110
Buffy the vampire slayer
like Buffy fucking up like
those 30 days of night type

324
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:43,730
vampires like something
really scary, something freaky
and scary instead of this,

325
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:48,140
you know, true blood. It's like,
it's like the high concept ones,

326
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:48,921
which are really good.

327
00:17:48,921 --> 00:17:51,410
Like the idea of like a really
hot chick who slaves vampires.

328
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,300
I got a buddy of mine's concept,
but he means doing a comic book. Uh,

329
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:55,860
you know the whole Zombie
thing, right? He's fine.

330
00:17:55,861 --> 00:17:58,260
I think what I think is the last take
you could possibly have on zombies,

331
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,630
it's comic, but call
the other dead. And uh,

332
00:18:00,631 --> 00:18:03,900
it's Josh or Taylor who wrote gears two
and he's doing it with a Kevin Eastman

333
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,910
who was one of the teenage
mutant Ninja turtle guys.

334
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,950
And the idea is the
Zombie apocalypse hits,

335
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,850
but it's just the animals
that get infected. Hmm.

336
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,570
So it was a Zombie animals
everywhere. The picture, any,

337
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,280
any animal you want everything from
like a fucking alligator through like a

338
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:20,220
honey badger, like anything. It's just
when, when I was talking about Buffy,

339
00:18:20,221 --> 00:18:23,040
I think that people take concepts
like that and they're like, well,

340
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,900
we know how to do this.
You know, let's do this.

341
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,530
Let's just like the rest of these shitty
fucking movies that are basically the

342
00:18:28,531 --> 00:18:32,760
same. Do them exactly the
same. It should win in the end.

343
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,570
No twists, nothing. Nothing's going to
pull you out of the art form itself.

344
00:18:36,571 --> 00:18:40,320
So you guys are talking about black fish
recently? Yeah. Fucking dude. Depressing.

345
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,080
Very depressing. Yeah. They were
saying about the captivities like,

346
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:46,890
you know the F is at her now.
She still looks fucking hot as fuck.

347
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,500
It's Kristy Swanson. Now
wonder what happened, man.

348
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:52,380
What kind of a disagreement there was
where they didn't use her as Buffy.

349
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,750
You never know. Right? Like Twitter.

350
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,660
Maybe you could've been that she was
like too much of a woman and they wanted

351
00:18:57,661 --> 00:18:59,640
someone who looked like a high school
girl because it's Buffy is supposed to be

352
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:02,430
in high school. Yeah.
That's so ridiculous. Sarah.

353
00:19:02,431 --> 00:19:06,270
Michelle Gellar is not high school.
I could fat how?

354
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,120
How many years did they do that though?
I thought you were going off for it.

355
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:10,200
I think six or seven seasons.

356
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:11,880
I haven't watched it all out and
they must've been like, damn,

357
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:13,620
we've got to get this pitch
out of high school. I tried it.

358
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,870
They did at some point.
Yeah. Fuck, she's married.

359
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:23,670
She's verified though. How many followers
does she have? 12,000 isn't that weird?

360
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,490
Like in how they get verified,
these publicists,

361
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,830
the publicists getting a black eye.

362
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,430
We got verified because my
agent has a buddy who's over
at Twitter. Oh yeah. Yeah.

363
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:35,020
That's something. It's that simple,
dude. I've had three publicists try,

364
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:40,030
but I keep on getting denied number
of people that hate you at Wikipedia.

365
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:42,660
I really think I fucked somebody.
Ex girlfriend or a girl,

366
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:45,570
current girlfriend or someone just listens
to the podcast and want to kill you.

367
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,000
Fucking,
it's really that simple.

368
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,400
Some guys like don't soil
Joe Rogan's podcast and like,

369
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:51,450
what the fuck does that mean?

370
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,270
Because like drop prowl and
take a dump on the table. Soil.

371
00:19:54,271 --> 00:19:56,390
It could you do possibly soylent.

372
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:01,020
What ideas did they have in their
fucking BD minds? Talk about RSS feeds.

373
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,490
Dude, I gotta fucking abusive relationship
with the walking dead. Speaking is,

374
00:20:04,491 --> 00:20:07,560
I'm over it.
I'm feeling good abused boyfriend.

375
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,980
Did you ever read the book side of
them yelling at me? No, I didn't.

376
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,520
The comics were stacking, told me they
were amazing. What happened was, uh,

377
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,640
when frank Darabont left
it, like the, the, it just
started getting wildly uneven.

378
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,840
Oh, he left. Yeah. Frigidaire. But, uh,

379
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,840
there was a controversy
over the direction or money.

380
00:20:21,841 --> 00:20:22,674
I don't remember what it was,

381
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,610
but it had that great of Buffy Frank
Darabont vibe to it at the beginning,

382
00:20:26,611 --> 00:20:29,010
you know, with Green Mile
Shawshank and at that heart to it.

383
00:20:29,011 --> 00:20:30,900
And he's in the mist was actually
a really underrated movie.

384
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:35,520
It was spectacular for awhile. And, uh, it
just, you know, this last ending though,

385
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,350
I mean, I don't want to give
away any spoilers for anybody,

386
00:20:37,351 --> 00:20:39,660
but I felt like an abused boyfriend.
There was a whole,

387
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,700
there's a whole relationship
in the books between me,

388
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:44,850
Sean and the governor that was fucking
amazing that they barely scratch the

389
00:20:44,851 --> 00:20:48,250
surface of, I think she, uh, in the
comic books, she nailed the governor's

390
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,050
nuts to the floor at one point.
If I recall,

391
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,100
like it was some pretty
hardcore shit and cut.

392
00:20:52,101 --> 00:20:53,440
He can get away with that in a comic book,

393
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,790
put it down on a TV show and
you're going to get people protest.

394
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,110
Here's the thing, man, the amount
of like you see World War Z. Yes.

395
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,260
I didn't like it. I just wasn't a fan
of it. I liked it. I didn't love it.

396
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,400
I liked it.
The problem is,

397
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:05,920
is they get to the point where
the budget is so fucking huge.

398
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,230
They got a paper ad pitch. He's
probably getting points in the back end.

399
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:10,720
So they had that,
that line where it's gotta be PG 13,

400
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:15,060
they can't make it are so the Gore on
the walking dead is 10 times gorier

401
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,360
Nastier than you would be in the PG 13
movie. The Gore, the walking dead though.

402
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,830
I really have issues with,

403
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,230
I have issues with how easy
knives go into heads first.

404
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,840
Like butter knives go right through
foreheads like nothing to four.

405
00:21:27,841 --> 00:21:29,260
It is a fucking tough bone.

406
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,780
Try stabbing someone in the
forehead with a big knife. Yeah,

407
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:35,720
that shit is not easy to get a try
to get a knife through some bone.

408
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:40,900
Just from personal experience. That would
be so gross TV show if you actually,

409
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:41,734
it was like,

410
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,860
like it was just like extended scenes
of trying to put nice things like the

411
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:46,720
stabbing scene in saving private Ryan.

412
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:49,680
Show me with a cadaver that you could
stick a fucking knife through its head.

413
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,060
That easy. That's ridiculous. You can't
do that. That's fucking hard to do.

414
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,640
Well that's the favorite
Internet mean was who's willing.

415
00:21:54,641 --> 00:21:56,620
The lawn and the walking
dead like all the,

416
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,350
all the grass is cut it about their faces.
They look beautiful.

417
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:02,260
The girls always have the same length
hair. No one ever cuts their hair.

418
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,510
They all have like a subtle
hint of makeup on all.

419
00:22:04,511 --> 00:22:07,750
It would take us one good shot of a hairy
leg. On a girl to just be like, sold,

420
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:12,710
sweat the details. Yeah. There's no
hairy legs. This one abused me this last,

421
00:22:12,711 --> 00:22:16,450
this last episode. I see what
they're doing. I was like,
yeah, you know what, man,

422
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,890
you're just fucking with me here. This
isn't necessarily that good. It's just,

423
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,380
dude, this shows just drag
on to drag on breaking bad,

424
00:22:23,381 --> 00:22:25,900
which ended it fucking perfectly.
It's hard.

425
00:22:25,901 --> 00:22:29,830
It's hard to fucking keep a show like that
going on. I'm sure you need a defiant,

426
00:22:29,831 --> 00:22:32,590
creative visionary. Like somebody who's
going to put their foot down and say,

427
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:35,300
here's what we're fucking doing.
Sound like you're pitching cliffy be dude.

428
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:38,020
Cliffy bees ready to step in and
take over the walking. What you need.

429
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:40,090
A defiant visionary.
What you need.

430
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:43,330
Look at a guy like the guy like Ken
Levine who makes bioshock infinite. Right?

431
00:22:43,331 --> 00:22:46,630
He's stuck him. Yeah. He's
stubborn as fuck. It's so let me,

432
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,290
let me pitch this to you. Okay. Uh,

433
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:51,190
it's an alternate universe that
they can't think. It's like 1930,

434
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,930
where this guy made a giant floating
city called Columbia. And, uh,

435
00:22:54,931 --> 00:22:58,450
it was basically a bunch of tea party
evangelists went off into the sky and

436
00:22:58,451 --> 00:23:00,760
created the utopia that
eventually turns into a dystopia.

437
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,400
And you go there to find a girl who can
create a rift between dimensions and

438
00:23:04,401 --> 00:23:07,660
there's a robotic George Washington.
That sounds pretty dope, dude.

439
00:23:07,661 --> 00:23:11,670
It's fucking with it. And it sounds
pretty, the ending is like twilight zone,

440
00:23:11,671 --> 00:23:13,070
unworthy, like, and that's really, yeah.

441
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,120
One thing we've been doing like late at
night in the wee hours in the mornings,

442
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,730
I get up at noon every fucking
day as we put it in the old,

443
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,490
the Blu blu rays at the
twilight zones. Oh, I love them.

444
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:25,270
And we're burning through every single
one and they're fucking fantastic around

445
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:27,550
SkyFii like almost every night.
And it's like, it's like,

446
00:23:27,551 --> 00:23:30,040
it's like Shawshank redemption once
it's on, you got to go the distance.

447
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,880
You got to watch the whole
thing. I watched the um, uh,

448
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:36,610
the William Shatner one the other day,
man, the man on the plane. Oh my God,

449
00:23:36,611 --> 00:23:41,380
it was so good. So fun to watch. And
then a w, w the one with the, uh,

450
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:45,040
there's one where the astronauts
crash land on an alien planet.

451
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,910
They land there and they
find tiny little people.

452
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,970
And then this guy becomes like
a God, Oh shit, you got that.

453
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:54,260
I got it before it becomes like a god
to them. And then at the end of it,

454
00:23:54,261 --> 00:23:58,310
it turns out there's another species
that's like as big to us as he was to the

455
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:58,880
little people.

456
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,840
And then he gets essentially squished
and they just in rod sterling man,

457
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:06,360
the intro is just slice. Like
they might have like, you know,

458
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,710
zooming over to him and he's like
always smoking. He's like, you know,

459
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:12,350
sitting in a wing, back chair
in front of a fucking fireplace.

460
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:16,100
Imagine if you will. Well,
he was so original to, when
you stop and think about it,

461
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:18,710
there really hadn't been anything
like that. And he was tapping,

462
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:22,970
he's tapping into lake, you know,
key Scifi writers of the time. Right.

463
00:24:22,971 --> 00:24:24,810
Just so much good shit.
What was that?

464
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:31,130
I think your laptop says laptop.
Okay. Um, making sure that, but just,

465
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,540
you know, the effects, you know,

466
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:34,120
they knew what they could show
and they knew what they couldn't.

467
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,830
So it's very light and affects
the characterization, the sets.

468
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,900
Sometimes you can tell
it's the same like diner.

469
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:42,320
They've repurposed 15 different times
for the different episodes separately.

470
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,640
Brian one the other one would
William tractor where uh,

471
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,380
there was like the little thing that
told the future which one was a,

472
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,670
there was like the little machine
that tells the future. Like, you know,

473
00:24:52,671 --> 00:24:55,940
you ask a question. Yeah. That
was fucking brilliant. Yeah.

474
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:59,360
That you just had footage of a bioshock
infinite. It's downloadable content.

475
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:03,800
Another one I watched recently
was the one with um, the uh,

476
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:07,730
the puppet that was running the show and
they were robbing people and the puppet

477
00:25:07,731 --> 00:25:11,800
was doing all the robbing. It doesn't
ring a bell. Yeah. It was like a, an uh,

478
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,790
the little kid knew that the puppet was,

479
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,940
that the puppet was actually
real and the little kid was like,

480
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:20,990
and on the old man who is, this is the
puppet set them up. We were watched.

481
00:25:20,991 --> 00:25:23,300
The one with the Trans
dimensional hole in the wall,

482
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:24,230
the little girl goes through.

483
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,070
So you go back and rewatch all
of those in so many movies.

484
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,840
Just took the same idea and updated it.

485
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,480
Like there's the one with the guy can
hear people's thoughts and that's what

486
00:25:32,481 --> 00:25:35,210
women want the Mel Gibson movie.
Right. Well that was cool.

487
00:25:35,211 --> 00:25:37,730
What was that guy that you just
showed Brian? That guy's face? Yeah.

488
00:25:37,731 --> 00:25:39,620
This is from that bio shock.
What was the,

489
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,990
go back to that as a scene
with that guy's face.

490
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:47,570
The graphics or be there that guy.
So Sandra Cohen,

491
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,990
eyes wide shut. This is
amazing. It's a, it's a,

492
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,020
it's actually a Zit on they put on PC.
I don't remember. I played on console.

493
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,200
I don't know. Yeah, I played
the DLC on PC cause yeah,

494
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,040
he's the only the only games
you would ever play over a PC.

495
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:01,930
First person shooters. Right. Joe?
Me. Yeah. I only played online too.

496
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,120
I wouldn't play against the game. I get
bored too. These, yeah. Well that's,

497
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:08,530
you know, every time I go to
event human there, that's boxhead.

498
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,380
Some guy comes up to me and he's like,
Yo man, it's all about the multiplayer.

499
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,250
And I'm like,
there it is all about the multiplayer.

500
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:17,630
This is the game that I
would highly recommend if you
want to play on a computer

501
00:26:17,631 --> 00:26:19,610
instead of a console.
Oh, this looks amazing.

502
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:22,400
It's one of the best games ever created.
This looks so good.

503
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:27,240
And does this available for Mac to Yep.
I think so. This will waste my day. Yeah.

504
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,000
This looks fun. Shit man. It's really
beautiful. Sky Hooks and shit. Yeah.

505
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,090
See the good thing about that is I won't
really get me addicted because it's not

506
00:26:35,091 --> 00:26:39,590
online. Yeah. If it was online, do
they play multiplayer? I think so. No.

507
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:44,160
Oh Dude, look at these zombies. Bad
Ass. Yeah. The idea is that they're uh,

508
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,670
their kids creepy and there's a
whole dirty, there's a whole, well,

509
00:26:47,671 --> 00:26:49,800
you can go now with the
dude. It's brilliant. Wow.

510
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,800
Is there so much creativity
involved in video games these days?

511
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:57,570
I had a chance a few years ago, uh,
to bring Josh Sweden over to e three,

512
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:00,000
and he walked out of there.
He said, I did 15 minutes.

513
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:03,690
I just saw more creativity than I've seen
in Hollywood and years. Yeah. Like when,

514
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,020
you know, like when halflife came out,
I remember thinking really clearly,

515
00:27:07,021 --> 00:27:10,890
why can't someone make a movie
like this? Like, why is the, why?

516
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,500
How come the video game
gets to be so cool? Like,

517
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,410
can't these same guys figured
out how to write a movie? Well,

518
00:27:16,411 --> 00:27:17,910
what's gonna happen now is,
you know,

519
00:27:17,911 --> 00:27:20,610
with the advent of Youtube and people
being able to create their own content,

520
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:21,150
you know,

521
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,550
people can do that and they can put it
up online and it could become an online

522
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:25,950
sensation. Right. That sound
Neill. BLOMKAMP got to start.

523
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,210
He did these shorts that he put on
Youtube. It's like lost in, uh, those,

524
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:32,490
the one about the robot and Africa,
I believe.

525
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,970
And then he wound up doing a Elise
IOM and district nine, no shit. Yeah,

526
00:27:35,971 --> 00:27:39,840
that's how I got founded. Wow. That makes
sense. And uh, he can see his style.

527
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:41,280
He was going to do the
halo movie at one point.

528
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,310
But so much of creativity is
just finding an outlet for it.

529
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,540
And when you're talking about something
specific about making a film or making a

530
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:51,180
television show,
it's so hard to get to that outlet.

531
00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:54,540
It's so hard to get to the point where
any of your ideas can actually be seen by

532
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:56,330
people.
You have the torque of it being,

533
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:00,210
making the art that you want versus
it being commercial products and we'll

534
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:03,900
itself, well not only that,
actually getting it to that point,

535
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:07,410
like if you want to be a director,
Jesus Christ, good fucking luck.

536
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,470
Good luck in getting to
direct a major motion picture.

537
00:28:10,471 --> 00:28:12,920
Like that's a long ass road.
Look, you've got to figure out,

538
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,070
you got to prove yourself to a lot of
people along the way. It's very difficult,

539
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:19,570
especially if they're gonna Trust,
you know, 50 a hundred $200 million.

540
00:28:19,571 --> 00:28:20,810
Now when you add in marketing costs,

541
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,180
I mean the thing about the gaming industry
right now matter and it's like it's

542
00:28:24,181 --> 00:28:27,660
fundamentally broken for the consoles
because what you have is a disk based game

543
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:31,860
that then can only come out at $60 and
then people traded in or they just rent

544
00:28:31,861 --> 00:28:34,890
it and then the marketing budgets
are trying to out weigh each other.

545
00:28:34,891 --> 00:28:37,440
So you know, a hundred million dollar
marketing budgets so you can get on,

546
00:28:37,441 --> 00:28:40,950
you know, NBA commercials or football
commercials or Superbowl ads, Jesus.

547
00:28:40,951 --> 00:28:44,430
And then he said so much money and they
annualize it, right? And then, you know,

548
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,030
I'm walking around to e three this year
and there's some fantastic looking games

549
00:28:47,031 --> 00:28:48,540
where I'm like,
that's probably not going to make money.

550
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:49,710
That'll barely break even.

551
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,320
They'll make money on the SQL with to
finally start making money when the

552
00:28:52,321 --> 00:28:56,280
annualized. Whereas A, I'm a fan of the
other way, just like developing your,

553
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,160
your community while you develop your
game. You know, you have new concept.

554
00:28:59,161 --> 00:29:01,750
I put it up in sub reddit and see what
people say, you know, when you had,

555
00:29:01,751 --> 00:29:03,930
and you need, you know, release a
Beta release in Alpha, you know,

556
00:29:03,931 --> 00:29:07,710
let people let people buy items
before you can even play the game.

557
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,220
You heard about that. Uh, Chris
Roberts, a star citizen game, no.

558
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,010
Guided a Kickstarter raise 2.5 million.

559
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:18,420
And then he has the ability to
essentially buy space ships for your,

560
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,090
it's like a dog fighting Sim. Like
got Luke Skywalker Shit. Right.

561
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,910
And you can basically buy your shifts
in your fleet and walk around in your

562
00:29:23,911 --> 00:29:25,980
hangar and sit in your ship.
You can't even fly it yet.

563
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,470
And they've raised $30 million so far. And
crowdfunding of course they have. Yeah.

564
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,390
And it's like,

565
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:33,120
it's also the whole thing's genius
and he's the guy made wing commander.

566
00:29:33,121 --> 00:29:35,340
And I think that, you know, my whole
10 year rule is like, you know,

567
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:38,580
the space sims where your dog fighting
everything like spaces cooler than ever

568
00:29:38,581 --> 00:29:42,190
right now. And one of the cool
things about, um, uh, about quake

569
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,400
when I was playing quake online all
the time. So they always put demos out.

570
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,430
There was always like a new game that
was coming out in the demos would be

571
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:51,460
released first and everyone downloaded
them for free and everyone got online.

572
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,480
And then once the game came out it was
like that may more people wanted to buy

573
00:29:55,481 --> 00:29:56,500
the game.
What they've done.

574
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,160
Well the problem is just getting a game
out takes so much work that like right

575
00:30:00,161 --> 00:30:04,030
now, uh, you know, I was talking to a,
I believe that's not public knowledge.

576
00:30:04,031 --> 00:30:07,120
I can admit that. Um, basically if
you're releasing it, it's friends.

577
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:08,850
I don't want to betray,
you don't want to betray their competence,

578
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,130
but let's call him Santa
Claus. In Rudolph, you want
to have a Beta Santa Claus.

579
00:30:12,131 --> 00:30:14,470
Tell Rudolph, uh, an
upcoming online shooter,

580
00:30:14,471 --> 00:30:16,240
you want to have a Beta
before the game comes out.

581
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:19,630
Cause if your game's fucked it launch,
it takes you two months to fix that.

582
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,830
Going through Sony or Microsoft.

583
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:23,230
And by that time everybody's treated your
gaming and they're onto the next call

584
00:30:23,231 --> 00:30:25,420
of duty. Like you have to
get it right the first time.

585
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,900
I think we're going to get to a time in
our lifetime where someone's going to be

586
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:33,820
able to make a game like this at home on
their PC by themselves. Well, they, uh,

587
00:30:33,821 --> 00:30:38,821
at the spike VG x that they announced
the game called a no man's sky,

588
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,630
which I'm like,
that's kind of a cool name,

589
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,820
but I'm going to totally
mispronounce it as no man's guy.

590
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,480
Shitty double o seven movie. Oh yeah.
Like a led Zeppelin song or something.

591
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,120
It's a space theme that's procedurally
generated and, uh, four guys.

592
00:30:52,121 --> 00:30:54,520
What does it mean? It means
basically every world is different.

593
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:57,940
It's all just done by code. Uh,
yeah. Here we go. Look at this shit.

594
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,240
Every hour dudes doing this
and they gotta be working.

595
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:04,060
The Guy said for his previous game,
he mortgaged his house for it.

596
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:07,830
That's how much they care.
I Bet I could sell them at a raw.

597
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:13,600
So basically you, you do is you go
from, you use exploring this planet.

598
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:16,120
He's underwater. He comes out of
the water, it goes into the forest,

599
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:17,350
hops in his spaceship.
It goes,

600
00:31:17,351 --> 00:31:19,150
flies all the way back out
of the atmosphere into space.

601
00:31:19,151 --> 00:31:23,140
Dog fights with people through asteroids.
Wow. And four guys made this. Yeah.

602
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,560
I don't know if it's all guys, but for
people. For humans. Yeah, let's call them.

603
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,590
Hey guys, like you would say
that even if it was girls, right.

604
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,770
Be Allowed to do that still it's,
so this is all just taking that from us.

605
00:31:32,771 --> 00:31:36,310
Cliffy being shitty to say guys
in a room of mixed company. Well,

606
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:40,410
I had tweeted a no man's sky wins the
title for most misogynistic game title

607
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,600
sarcastically. No Man's sky of
it's funny. And people like,

608
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:46,870
actually wouldn't it be feminists because
there's no men. I'm like, retweet what?

609
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,440
Then there's,

610
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,910
there's people Uber on the way over
here and people tweeting me like your

611
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,910
fucking duty too.
I'm like,

612
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,300
sarcasm does not translate well on the
Internet with these kids sometimes.

613
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,120
Well with some of them,

614
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,090
the problem is it's just so many of
them out there dealing with millions of

615
00:32:01,091 --> 00:32:05,380
people bound to hit a few retards going
now to 15 now you're at a million plus

616
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:09,860
now, right? Yeah. Do you see even read
your ad still? Yeah, I read them. Yeah.

617
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,850
I mean I can't read all of them.
It's not possible. It can't respond.

618
00:32:12,851 --> 00:32:13,630
I don't have enough time,

619
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,700
but they just want to know you're
reading or replying to some of them.

620
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:19,270
I try to retweet interesting stuff and
then that way I think it's been a really

621
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,490
positive exchange for me too for,

622
00:32:21,491 --> 00:32:24,640
I've gotten a lot out of being connected
to people on Twitter because they're

623
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:28,030
always sending me interesting articles
and ideas and knowing that I'll retweet

624
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:31,420
them. You've trained them well. It's,
it's like it's a cool thing to do.

625
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,220
You know people like being retweeted,

626
00:32:33,221 --> 00:32:36,690
it helps them get more followers and
if you're a guy that he regularly posts

627
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:40,340
cool shit, you can become
like a portal to information.

628
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:40,920
Yeah,

629
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,120
it has a bunch of guys that have follow
on Twitter that are just regular folks

630
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:45,200
would regular jobs.

631
00:32:45,201 --> 00:32:48,020
They just like cool shit and they find
your articles and they tweet them and

632
00:32:48,021 --> 00:32:50,240
then you retweet them. And so we go
back and forth like all the time,

633
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,150
especially with technological
advancements and essay stuff,

634
00:32:53,151 --> 00:32:54,590
all that stuff going on right now.
It's like,

635
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,500
I don't want to put my
tin foil hat on, but, um,

636
00:32:56,570 --> 00:33:00,950
the more I hear and the more
comes out, I'm like, fuck,
really? Then Nsa Shit, I'm,

637
00:33:00,951 --> 00:33:05,090
I'm just trying to dwell on that as little
as possible because it's so negative

638
00:33:05,091 --> 00:33:07,880
and it feels so helpless and
it's just such a weird thing.

639
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:11,570
The idea that we're like about to
relinquish all of our privacy to other

640
00:33:11,571 --> 00:33:13,910
individuals that are no
different than you or I, they're,

641
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:17,990
they're just fucking people and just
because they're in some form of government

642
00:33:17,991 --> 00:33:21,110
and they're trying to, you know,
keep quote unquote us safe.

643
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,110
How about we examine all your
actions that you're doing,

644
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:28,550
that you are doing to keep us safe
before we let you access our email? Oh,

645
00:33:28,551 --> 00:33:32,680
you've been accessing our email for
a decade. I was working on a uh, uh,

646
00:33:32,681 --> 00:33:35,150
a game in epic that was canceled,
but I was a, I don't want to,

647
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,760
I'm still under NDA with them but
I don't want to get it too much.

648
00:33:37,761 --> 00:33:39,510
That's a nondisclosure agreement.

649
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,390
Some of the things we were googling I
know is sitting off a light in the NSA

650
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:48,620
cause you know like as far as far as like
a revolution and terrorism and things

651
00:33:48,621 --> 00:33:49,590
like that. And it's just, you know,

652
00:33:49,591 --> 00:33:53,060
like some sort of red flag was going off
and it's a post Patriot Act man. Yeah.

653
00:33:53,061 --> 00:33:55,460
It's pumping a bunch of fucking
paranoid people for sure.

654
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:59,720
I mean if you really stop and think about
how few actual terrorist activity you

655
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:02,870
see in America and how many
fucking people are in America,

656
00:34:02,871 --> 00:34:04,220
they've done a great job in that respect.

657
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:07,760
Well that's the difference also between
a perception fear like you know, people,

658
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,310
people tell me fly safe. I'm
like fuck off, drive safe.

659
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,130
But it isn't when you stop
and think about it. I mean,

660
00:34:13,131 --> 00:34:15,140
and I'm not advocating in any way,

661
00:34:15,141 --> 00:34:17,840
shape or form that anybody should
have access to any of your emails.

662
00:34:17,841 --> 00:34:19,250
Cause I think that's a really ineffective,

663
00:34:19,251 --> 00:34:23,780
shitty bullshit way of trying to protect
people because by removing all of their

664
00:34:23,781 --> 00:34:25,910
privacy, I think that's a
bullshit way to handle it.

665
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,750
But if you look at what
the job they have done,

666
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,660
if the really is a bunch of terrorist
activity all over the world,

667
00:34:32,661 --> 00:34:35,840
they've done an amazing job of
keeping shit from happen in America.

668
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,660
I think it's not a black or white case.

669
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:41,300
I think there's good
and bad on both sides.

670
00:34:41,301 --> 00:34:45,170
The problem is just a fucking human
nature problem and she can't have ultimate

671
00:34:45,171 --> 00:34:47,210
power. You can't have it. Whoever. Yeah.

672
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:49,790
There was an article I believe where
they're talking about easing people's

673
00:34:49,791 --> 00:34:51,950
pornographic habits to shame
them for political reasons.

674
00:34:51,951 --> 00:34:55,880
If they need and they were spying on
world of Warcraft players, come on,

675
00:34:55,881 --> 00:35:00,170
you fucks. Unbelievable. This
just came out today. Well,

676
00:35:00,171 --> 00:35:02,430
the other problem is people are
willing to give up so much of it.

677
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:05,150
They're doing it because
they're being tricked.

678
00:35:05,151 --> 00:35:07,280
I mean that's like saying someone's,
you know,

679
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:10,160
willing to suck your Dick for cocaine
and they don't even know it's aspirin.

680
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:10,731
I mean,

681
00:35:10,731 --> 00:35:13,090
it's like you're thinking you're getting
some cocaine and you're getting an

682
00:35:13,091 --> 00:35:14,930
aspirin. You're like, God,
what the fuck happened?

683
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,050
You're not really getting anybody
to save you and I really good.

684
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:21,350
You're going to die anyway.
We're all gonna die. We're
gonna die in car accidents.

685
00:35:21,351 --> 00:35:24,500
We're going to die of cancer. We're
going to die of being old. It's just,

686
00:35:24,501 --> 00:35:26,300
it's going to happen.
You're getting on dialysis on me.

687
00:35:26,301 --> 00:35:28,160
It's going to fucking happen.
What's the point?

688
00:35:28,161 --> 00:35:31,490
The idea that you know you're going
to protect all these people from dying

689
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,620
because you're going to
stop terrorist activity,

690
00:35:33,621 --> 00:35:35,990
and the way to do that is to
remove all freedom. You start,

691
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,330
you'll okay is happy about this life.

692
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:44,600
If this life is living scared and living
where you're being watched every step

693
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,690
by random people who's going
to profit with everything,

694
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,840
follow the chain of the profit by that,
that all should be illegal.

695
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:55,260
You shouldn't be able to profit by any
protections like private prisons and all

696
00:35:55,261 --> 00:35:58,650
that to keeping people alive and healthy
shouldn't be able to profit over that.

697
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,800
Policing every,
everything should be nonprofit.

698
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:06,390
The idea that they have a giant budget
and these people get to make big salaries,

699
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,940
make donations to charities,
like do your homework with,

700
00:36:08,941 --> 00:36:12,300
with how much of the money actually
goes to the cause versus quote raising

701
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:15,930
awareness versus, and what the CEO
of the nonprofit makes all of that.

702
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:19,680
Like the reddit listed out of list of
a bunch of them at one point like the,

703
00:36:19,681 --> 00:36:22,590
that goodwill is basically like just
selling all your clothes for money and

704
00:36:22,591 --> 00:36:24,570
things like that.
Just like crazy.

705
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,960
This is a bunch of shit that gets done
in this country that should get done by

706
00:36:27,961 --> 00:36:32,070
paypal. Like paypal donations.
Like that's what the presidency,

707
00:36:32,071 --> 00:36:35,370
that's what the government
should get. Like paypal
donations. We think a good job.

708
00:36:35,371 --> 00:36:39,180
We'll give you a nice tip and then
that's how you keep the society running.

709
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,760
And the only way you ever get paid is if
people like what you're doing and they

710
00:36:42,761 --> 00:36:46,440
choose to donate and they donate what
they can and we make it like, you know,

711
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:50,070
everybody's proud. Just like people
are proud to serve in the military.

712
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,950
People were proud to donate to
the, to the government. Yup.

713
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:57,150
Donates not steal all my money at Fox
and I say support the troops because if

714
00:36:57,151 --> 00:36:59,470
you get my assets and getting
shot at, but yes, absolutely.

715
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:02,340
But if you think about like the
idea of donating to the government,

716
00:37:02,341 --> 00:37:06,120
it's actually probably a pretty good idea
because you would only want to donate

717
00:37:06,121 --> 00:37:07,420
to things that you believed in.

718
00:37:07,421 --> 00:37:10,680
You would only want to donate to things
that you've felt actually fit for the

719
00:37:10,681 --> 00:37:11,251
good of the people.

720
00:37:11,251 --> 00:37:15,210
So the people in the community would
decide like what's good and what's bad and

721
00:37:15,211 --> 00:37:18,270
that's how things would get voted on at
Kickstarter like right. Yeah. It's just,

722
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,860
I think this is probably a stupid idea
because it's too much shit. I did,

723
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:23,850
I mention to people will say like the 1%
we control everything cause they donate

724
00:37:23,851 --> 00:37:27,390
the most money for their field.
Whatever their interests are of course is,

725
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,220
which is basically what it,
what's going on right now.

726
00:37:29,221 --> 00:37:33,450
We'd have to keep corporations from
doing it. Only make individuals do it.

727
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,000
You know,
the problem is it's like,

728
00:37:36,001 --> 00:37:40,650
it's almost like a game where you start
off and it's already a thousand to zero.

729
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,730
You're never going to catch up.
The game is five minutes long,

730
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,550
you're never going to catch
up. You started off with
this massive deficit. Yep.

731
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:51,180
And if you grow up in the United States
and you're trying to do anything where

732
00:37:51,181 --> 00:37:55,560
you're, you're trying to govern
people or control wealth or you know,

733
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:01,500
the amount of fucking momentum that's
already been put in the other direction is

734
00:38:02,461 --> 00:38:04,950
so crazy.
[inaudible] my own personal success.

735
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:06,960
Back to the fact that my
family was middle class,

736
00:38:06,961 --> 00:38:10,380
my dad bad dad worked for Polaroid and
the fact that they had an extra like two

737
00:38:10,381 --> 00:38:13,680
grand to buy an apple too, like that
was the jump off point right there.

738
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,250
And I took to that thing
like a fish to water.

739
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:18,660
It was originally supposed to be for
my brother and uh, I just steal it. No,

740
00:38:18,661 --> 00:38:20,670
I just started using it and he
wasn't using it. He was too busy.

741
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,870
He's too busy chasing pussy at the time.
Pouch Kabob bow. I actually found it.

742
00:38:24,871 --> 00:38:28,610
SB nation.com and like a polygon
and all that, you know, he's uh,

743
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,230
he's done well in his own right.
But anyway, that's not the point.

744
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:34,820
So you got into that just
from one purchase that your
parents were able to like

745
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,120
I to take my brother's eight

746
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,070
track and pretend it was a computer
because I want her computer so fucking bad

747
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,910
listening into like fucking
hall and Oates and all that.

748
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:45,000
She used to pretend it was a computer.
Yeah. That's hilarious. Yeah.

749
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:49,540
You like eve had a pull towards computers.
I've,

750
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:52,880
I've had a technology boner since I
was a kid. I love technology. What did,

751
00:38:52,881 --> 00:38:55,030
do you have a background in
any educational background?

752
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:58,840
I went to cal poly Pomona for six months
and I dropped out cause I dropped out.

753
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,870
I hated it. I dropped out. Uh, when Jazz
Jack Rabbit started making enough money,

754
00:39:01,871 --> 00:39:04,390
that's the first successful game I did.
It got me my first car,

755
00:39:04,391 --> 00:39:06,390
which was a 99 red Saturn.
Uh,

756
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,370
I got my first apartment
over outside Pomona and uh,

757
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:12,050
basically also also my mum
wouldn't run the air conditioning.

758
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,370
We were over in Laverne and it'd be like
summer, like 120 degree. She's like,

759
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,410
she'd be like open and went out cliff.
And I'm like,

760
00:39:17,411 --> 00:39:20,260
it's like opening a fucking oven.
Like it's not doing anything. God,

761
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,870
that's hot as fuck. Yeah. Now when you,

762
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:26,320
when you get into it as a video
game designer, right? Do you,

763
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:29,350
what account type technological
knowledge do you have to have?

764
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:32,890
Do you just have id? And they said like,
this is how I'd like to gain to play.

765
00:39:32,891 --> 00:39:36,570
This was what I would like to happen.
You start off with verbs. Like what,

766
00:39:36,571 --> 00:39:38,710
what are the verbs that you're doing
this game? Are you kicking, punching,

767
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:40,210
fighting, exploring, right?

768
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,760
Like figure out what type of thing you're
going to make. And for me, uh, you know,

769
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:43,211
I've always,

770
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:46,030
guns are easy and that's why everything
I've ever made pretty much has a gun in

771
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:47,470
it. You know, if I get
back to making games,

772
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:50,290
I'm not gonna make like a polar bear
fighting simulator. It's a very boring,

773
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:52,650
when you have a video game,
you can't shoot somebody else.

774
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,150
It's our way of interacting.
It's, it's touching, right?

775
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:57,370
And as much as the baddies are coming,

776
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:00,820
shooting people in the face at 60
frames a second through iron sights will

777
00:40:00,821 --> 00:40:02,450
always be fun at the end of,

778
00:40:02,451 --> 00:40:04,990
and especially when it's somebody like
who's like your friend or you know,

779
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,680
online, a random person. Right. Yeah. But
it was, I was just attracted to it, man.

780
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:12,190
I just, I made my first game and a little
adventure game when I was 11 and, uh,

781
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,890
just, you know, started cranking. All
the kids were partying in high school.

782
00:40:14,891 --> 00:40:18,490
I was sitting at home and
working on games. Yeah. Yeah.

783
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:23,020
20th high school reunion recently, by
the way. Wow. What was that like? It was,

784
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,330
you know, I didn't know what
to expect going into it,

785
00:40:25,331 --> 00:40:28,330
but everyone was really fucking cool.
Oh, that's nice. You know, and like,

786
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,590
I'm not mark Zuckerberg,

787
00:40:29,591 --> 00:40:32,230
but some of them were making little
comments and jokes like, and I'm like,

788
00:40:32,231 --> 00:40:35,320
look guys, I mean, I did okay, but I
didn't fly her in a fucking private jet.

789
00:40:35,321 --> 00:40:38,700
Calm down.
Did you get a involved?

790
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,230
But you need to get marijuana
in your life. I was in Boston.

791
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:45,250
I remember I'm from Boston. Yeah, that's
a harsh place. I was a sub the suburbs.

792
00:40:45,251 --> 00:40:47,500
It's north Andover. It's super cute
up there. What were you saying?

793
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,640
Did you get an Oculus rift?
Yeah, I'm actually an investor
in it. Oh really? Yeah.

794
00:40:51,641 --> 00:40:52,900
I'm going out there and
Wednesday to see the,

795
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,210
apparently they have some really
good breakthroughs they've gotten,

796
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,940
did you see the jerk off breakthrough?
No.

797
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,420
They have oculus rift attached to
a jerk off machines with the guys.

798
00:41:01,421 --> 00:41:04,630
Like the Japanese guy was like, he's
in it right there. Yeah, they don't,

799
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:07,570
they don't want to talk too much about
the whole porn thing. How dare they,

800
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:11,170
how dare they not know the truth.
Horn drives technology is, you know,

801
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:15,100
that's really gonna drive technology
because everybody sees the writing on the

802
00:41:15,101 --> 00:41:17,830
wall. We were talking about it a little
bit before we got online here was, uh,

803
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,070
did you see Don John, Don
John? Yeah. It's the, um,

804
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,070
what's so what's his name from uh, Joseph
Gordon leave it wrote and directed it.

805
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,340
Scarlet Johannson. It's
about the, oh no I didn't.

806
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:30,550
I know it's a great movie and it's really
fun. Well, his whole thing is like,

807
00:41:30,551 --> 00:41:34,400
he's basically addicted to online porn
and like he finally beds the character

808
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:37,730
scar Johanson who's gorgeous
and immediately goes out
to his laptop to run one

809
00:41:37,731 --> 00:41:40,700
out and it starts off like his
laptop booting up sound. He's like,

810
00:41:40,701 --> 00:41:42,950
just the sound of that
makes my cock rock hard.

811
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,830
And he's going on about all the people
he likes and everything. And I read,

812
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,800
there was a story I read online,
it was talking about real life,

813
00:41:48,801 --> 00:41:52,970
dawn John's guys who've become so addicted
to like how good modern pornography

814
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:55,430
is that they get ed and
they can't get it up.

815
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:58,550
And so what happens is there's the
younger generation of young dudes,

816
00:41:58,551 --> 00:42:00,950
because apparently the each we
start looking forward is 10.

817
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,660
That's when you start
looking at the average,

818
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,490
the average young dude right now in,
but girls,

819
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:07,400
and I don't know actually they didn't
mention girls too much. Um, they,

820
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:10,280
maybe they start reading 50 shades of
gray to get an early age or flowers in the

821
00:42:10,281 --> 00:42:10,551
attic.

822
00:42:10,551 --> 00:42:14,360
50 shades of grey is more for a gal who's
been working for 10 years and has kind

823
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:16,830
of given up on excitement.
Yeah. My wife read it.

824
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:20,630
She said it was just kind of dumb. It's
supposed to be pretty stupid. Yeah.

825
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,060
And I'm just talking shit. I don't
know. Well so back to the whole,

826
00:42:23,061 --> 00:42:24,110
the porn thing is that a,

827
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:26,840
and so they found that like the older
generation guys from their thirties who

828
00:42:26,841 --> 00:42:29,420
have that problem with, with Ed
from too much porn, like they can,

829
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:32,390
they can bounce back in a couple of
months, but the kids take so long.

830
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,760
And the reason why is
like when we were young,

831
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:37,490
we'd have to find our brothers hustler
underneath their bed or whatever. Right.

832
00:42:37,491 --> 00:42:40,880
We, we had like, you know, analog
porn right now on your phone.

833
00:42:40,881 --> 00:42:43,840
You could just watch like super slow Mo,
whatever,

834
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:46,790
the most filthy shit imaginable
pursuing my phone. Look at that screen.

835
00:42:46,791 --> 00:42:51,040
You sexy bitch. Fucking huge. It's
either a really small Joe Rogan,

836
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:54,720
a really big phone. It's a
note three. Nice. I mean I,

837
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,870
I'm a droid guy guy cause he has the
s three is fucking terrible. Like I,

838
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:00,680
the s four apparently fixes all
the problems as far as nice.

839
00:43:00,681 --> 00:43:03,410
I've played with that. I almost got
that I got this instead because I was,

840
00:43:03,411 --> 00:43:06,650
I'm just greedy. Everyone's like, why
aren't you get an iPhone on? Like I just,

841
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:09,110
I don't refuse to fully
drink the apple koolaid.

842
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,920
It's good to stay away a little bit.
Just in case the apple falls apart.

843
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:16,580
You still have options. My wife and my
wife has the iPhone. I have the droid.

844
00:43:16,581 --> 00:43:19,340
I can see the best of both worlds
in nine times out of 10 the APP,

845
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,860
like if there's an app that's on the
iPhone, that's an app that's on the droid.

846
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,520
Droid one just barely works.
Barely was fucking focus problem.

847
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,230
Instagram's terrible. Yeah. So
it's so clunky. I used a god, I um,

848
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:33,830
I got the shit at my house.
I'm addicted to have apps in my house.

849
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,770
I got the hue it.

850
00:43:35,771 --> 00:43:38,870
Have you seen that basically it replaces
your light bulbs with these LEDs? Yeah,

851
00:43:38,871 --> 00:43:42,000
we have, I'll give you an antibiotic. We
have it here, we just never installed it.

852
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:45,380
And so a fucking, then I have
the, uh, what's the, the nest,

853
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,170
which is to controls or Hvac
from your phone. So I'll wake up,

854
00:43:48,171 --> 00:43:49,540
I'm a little warm in the morning,
go to my phone,

855
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:52,010
lower the air conditioning temperature,
and then it learns throughout the week.

856
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:56,210
And then nest just is introducing a
thermostat that I got also where you can

857
00:43:56,211 --> 00:43:59,150
basically a,
if it's a smoke detector actually,

858
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:01,790
and instead of just going
like right off the bat,

859
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:04,610
it just goes when it gets a slight
puff of smoke, it's like, oh, small,

860
00:44:04,611 --> 00:44:07,610
small digita detected. Right.
And then if it says it, yeah.

861
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:10,400
And then you can just wave it away as
opposed to scaring the shit out of your

862
00:44:10,401 --> 00:44:11,870
dog. Right. And then, uh,

863
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,980
if there's more smoke then it eventually
builds to full alarm. So what the,

864
00:44:14,981 --> 00:44:18,410
what these guys are doing over there
is essentially taking all these, like,

865
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:19,671
I wouldn't say Apps,

866
00:44:19,671 --> 00:44:22,040
these utilities that people just didn't
think about improving them and their

867
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:24,650
apple buying them there. They're making
them work and they're just brilliant.

868
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:28,280
Yeah, they're great. It also
has carbon dioxide or whatever,

869
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:32,190
the oxide oxide, carbon dioxide. Just slow

870
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:32,940
down.

871
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:36,750
Think about what you're saying right
before you say it and you can get through

872
00:44:36,751 --> 00:44:40,260
it. But yeah, man, it's a
I technology. I just like,

873
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,360
we have a three d printer at the house.
We've got the rift,

874
00:44:42,361 --> 00:44:45,660
I got the idea of a three d printer.
Would he printed it? I got it.

875
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:49,170
That's how I was saying I'm gonna print
custom butt plugs for all my buddies for

876
00:44:49,171 --> 00:44:51,480
Christmas. That's sweet.
Um, yeah, my wife,

877
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:55,500
my wife printed with three d halo pistol
and like she basically had had a print

878
00:44:55,501 --> 00:44:58,800
every single part like the
and just assemble the whole
damn thing and it's like

879
00:44:58,801 --> 00:45:00,720
life size and it's just,
it's just,

880
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:04,290
it heats the plastic and then it just
basically does it bit by bit and you can

881
00:45:04,291 --> 00:45:07,610
download things from thingiverse.com
and they're also going to be able to do

882
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:08,960
with the metal, right? Like, yeah.

883
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:13,860
This is just like plastic gun control
will be a thing of the past. That's weird.

884
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:15,360
There's a guy right now who could,
who made up,

885
00:45:15,361 --> 00:45:16,890
we've made a plastic gun that could fire,
uh,

886
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:20,400
the first one round than several
rounds and the data that you can't,

887
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:23,520
once the data's out there, that the
genie's out of the bottle. You know,

888
00:45:23,521 --> 00:45:25,840
it's like I say about about
trying to delete a tweet.

889
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:28,350
So I tried to suck a fart back in your
ass. It just doesn't work that way.

890
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:31,790
And so you'd be more successful, suck
in a far back in your ass, you know,

891
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,410
fair thing. If you worked on it
for years, he had a good prolapse,

892
00:45:34,411 --> 00:45:34,920
you could probably,

893
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:39,090
this is things that people can do that
would shock you like pussy farts in a

894
00:45:39,091 --> 00:45:42,360
microphone. You can do man, people,
some people have special gifts.

895
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:45,390
When I'm on a plane it seems like I fart
and it sucks back in like it does it

896
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:47,550
for like hours on end and
not see your neighbor.

897
00:45:47,551 --> 00:45:51,660
You fuck dude sitting there
going, [inaudible] spill
it and you know your shit.

898
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:52,290
Now,
this guy,

899
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:55,410
I made the mistake of going from American
at Delta one time in American has

900
00:45:55,411 --> 00:45:57,600
these seats that absorbed the farts.
It's like cloth,

901
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:01,110
but in Delta it's like this kind of
rubbery thing. And so the far just tits,

902
00:46:01,111 --> 00:46:02,220
it goes fucking straight up.

903
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:06,420
Who'd be a very smart move to develop
some sort of a fart free airplane.

904
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:09,630
Well there's somebody made made underwear
that has some special filter that had

905
00:46:09,631 --> 00:46:12,930
carbon filter. Yeah, exactly. I'm
not going to work on Joey Diaz.

906
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:17,850
I got news for you. I wrote a blog once
about a fart that he took on a plane.

907
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:22,380
I was next to him and I was writing and
he was lying there with his hands on his

908
00:46:22,381 --> 00:46:25,440
stomach and, and uh, I
saw him like lift up,

909
00:46:25,441 --> 00:46:29,470
like he adjusted his weight and
before it was too late, I, I,

910
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:33,060
it hit me like a Zombie Barak,
like a truck.

911
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,500
And I had headphones on.

912
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:38,130
I was listening to music and over the
music I heard the woman behind me go,

913
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:43,410
oh my God.
It was so,

914
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:48,960
she goes, oh my God, dude.

915
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:53,340
Fuck her farts are always, always
fucking funny, but it was so bad.

916
00:46:53,341 --> 00:46:57,450
I had to put my shirt over my face.
I had to duck down.

917
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,740
I was on a plane once and a dude
farted on Melanie Griffin's head.

918
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:03,540
This is how it works.

919
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:09,090
I was on a plane and I was flying from
New York to London and it's a long flight.

920
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,200
And when we were on the Ohs, actually la
to London, and when we're on the plane,

921
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,510
Melanie Griffin lied down.
She went to sleep or her,

922
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:21,620
her thing extends and this guy lied down
and he went to sleep and he was a fat

923
00:47:21,901 --> 00:47:24,480
guy. And if there's a fact,
if there's a fart on a plane,

924
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:28,180
you always look to the fact that it's
it just, just the way it is, you know?

925
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:30,700
Fair enough.
Everybody does got fucking crop dusted.

926
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,490
It's sleep no more in New York City
recently. You ever hear about that show?

927
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:37,600
So Melanie Griffiths, head, Melanie
Griffith, head in this guy's ass.

928
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,910
We're three feet away from each other.

929
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:44,440
He was turned sideways with his ass
facing her or she was turned sideways with

930
00:47:44,441 --> 00:47:48,100
her face facing his ass
in perfect alignment,

931
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,310
just a few feet apart.
Like how was that even happen?

932
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:54,010
Like if you ever thought in the universe
when you were watching a movie with

933
00:47:54,011 --> 00:47:57,700
Melanie Griffith then and that one day
I'm going to get to Fart in her face.

934
00:47:57,701 --> 00:48:02,260
Her face going to be three feet away and
I'm just going to open up on her face.

935
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,720
Little curly hair,
kind of like moves in the breeze.

936
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:09,040
It was weird to see because I was
awake or wake up or did she? She moved,

937
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,331
she did something.

938
00:48:10,331 --> 00:48:13,810
It's like inception where
she'd go trenching and like
a sewage bin or something.

939
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:17,020
It was a horrible fart. I
kissed her. I opened it on her.

940
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:22,110
I can't stay the proximity. So
strange. Its power. I mean what,

941
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:26,410
how much would it cost to say like Melanie
Griffith, there's a guy, he's weird,

942
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:28,390
you know he's a nice guy,
but he wants a fart in your face.

943
00:48:28,391 --> 00:48:31,990
He's willing to give you $5 million. He's
the problem. He's Brazilian. How much,

944
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,150
how much would you have to
pay or to partner face me.

945
00:48:34,151 --> 00:48:38,220
Monster took one for nothing. Right? And
the mug three feet away. And the guy,

946
00:48:38,221 --> 00:48:42,670
he's the guy opened on her.
You think he knew he farted hard dude.

947
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,280
There's no way like pushing the,

948
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:48,640
he wasn't asleep ed either cause he had
been moving around a lot before he cut

949
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:52,480
that Fart, you know, would
probably had upset stomach. Oh Hey.

950
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,630
You know something about the pressure
change to just pop people just like the

951
00:48:55,631 --> 00:48:58,030
Fart. I think if you're
around people that just fart,

952
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:01,270
most of the time people hold
it in until no one's around.

953
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:04,330
But when you get in a plane, it's
11 hours. You're like, fuck it.

954
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:08,240
Melanie's got us off. And I fucking
love Fart and elevators. Do you, I'm,

955
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:11,950
that guy is terrible.
I'll live in a condo right now.

956
00:49:11,951 --> 00:49:13,660
My niece and my neighbors don't like me.
And so,

957
00:49:13,661 --> 00:49:17,480
and just like walking the dog and just
why don't you neighbors like you? Um,

958
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:20,230
I installed a, okay, so here's the deal.

959
00:49:20,231 --> 00:49:23,920
Living in the condo right now and I bought
the condo next door and I cut a hole

960
00:49:23,921 --> 00:49:24,640
in the wall.

961
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,990
And so then in that Condo I put in like
a theater room and then I put it in a

962
00:49:28,991 --> 00:49:32,980
450 gallon hot tub. You can see
where this is going in the condo.

963
00:49:32,981 --> 00:49:34,330
So you haven't parties. Yeah, well,

964
00:49:34,331 --> 00:49:37,570
so I was building basically the ultimate
Pussy Palace right when the love of my

965
00:49:37,571 --> 00:49:39,820
life showed up. Like whenever
they finish the final bit of tile.

966
00:49:39,821 --> 00:49:41,950
And I was going to be like, I'm going to
be a bachelor. This is going to be great.

967
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:45,700
Boom. My dream girl appears. And
I'm like, Oh, well that was fun.

968
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:49,660
And so then, uh, when I
had the tub installed,

969
00:49:49,661 --> 00:49:52,570
I didn't have an overflow
valve installed. Oh, Jesus.

970
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:55,020
And this is during like crunch time,
I think I'm like year three,

971
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:59,790
a few years ago and I left the
water on. Oh, Jesus. Now, yeah,

972
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:04,150
I went to dinner and the three
condos beneath me flooded.

973
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:07,960
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

974
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:12,100
One lawsuit later with my Hoa,
which is still pending. It's, uh,

975
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,930
it's been an interesting journey.
Needless to say, they had a star ceiling.

976
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:18,040
It's still pending. Yeah. Where's we're
working on coming to terms for it. It's,

977
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:21,040
I don't want to get into the details,
but I had a star ceiling at it. The,

978
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:24,520
the tub filled from the ceiling and see
match how the guy below me felt like

979
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:28,070
it's just like a fucking
freight train. Dude. That's so

980
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:32,720
crazy. How much was the total
damage? 80 grand. That seems cheap.

981
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,510
Yeah. It sounds like it'd be
a lot more than that. Yeah.

982
00:50:35,511 --> 00:50:39,480
If it was la would have been, yeah, yeah,
yeah. That's probably what it is, right?

983
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:43,310
Yeah, I'm right. 1 million couple,
man. I was thinking millions. Yeah,

984
00:50:43,311 --> 00:50:46,130
that seems like a lot of money.
But yeah, it's a, so, I mean,

985
00:50:46,131 --> 00:50:48,260
we bought a house when we're here to
renovating and we're gonna be moving up

986
00:50:48,261 --> 00:50:51,560
there. So Carolina is pretty fucking
awesome. 80 ground dude. Yeah.

987
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:55,670
I mean go move. Really just to get
out of here. It really is the move.

988
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:58,040
The only thing that would suffer
it would be the podcast guest.

989
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:01,310
You wouldn't get as many cool guests.
We have a direct flight finally. Yeah.

990
00:51:01,311 --> 00:51:04,100
But I'm not flying back and forth from
fucking North Carolina. All I know.

991
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:07,550
If you live there, you live there. And
the other thing would be flying to gigs.

992
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:09,890
Yeah. But it's a better move, man. I,

993
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,280
I've Nvu it's a better move
because it's not a backwoods town.

994
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,240
Raleigh's a great town. Great
restaurants. Bioshock infinite in Quincy,

995
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:19,700
Massachusetts. You know,
I mean, come on man.

996
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:23,750
What is that one restaurant that you
guys have that fucking insane barbecue

997
00:51:23,751 --> 00:51:27,650
place. The pit. Yeah. Holy Shit is,
that's where all the celebs go. Yeah.

998
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:31,070
All the celebs. How dare you just,
we're just talking about food here man.

999
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:33,590
And why did you have to go there? I
don't know. All the celebs go there.

1000
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:35,840
That's what Joe Rogan goes.
It's delicious food man.

1001
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:39,680
There's like how many restaurants
did they and they are like,

1002
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:41,930
it's fucking exploded.
Yeah.

1003
00:51:41,931 --> 00:51:44,420
There's a lot of restaurants there and
we noticed that when we're back there.

1004
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,930
But then pit places, a lot
of great walkable spots
now. Like we just, you know,

1005
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,360
take our bikes around and shit
and it's just fun. You know?

1006
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:53,060
So it's not too many people.
That's what it is.

1007
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:58,310
You spent $400,000 for a house out there.
Forget it. You're good. You're good.

1008
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:02,680
Like it's, it's great. You can even might
can get great house in apex for 200 wow.

1009
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:04,250
Just unreal.
And like my protector,

1010
00:52:04,251 --> 00:52:07,190
my brother lives in orange where you
can get a starter house for 800 grand,

1011
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:10,430
you know, and it's just fucking
California man. You know, we can,

1012
00:52:10,431 --> 00:52:12,740
we briefly consider moving out here. And
I looked at the real estate. I'm like,

1013
00:52:12,741 --> 00:52:17,570
I cannot justify to us if you're
gonna live in La. It's like, you know,

1014
00:52:17,571 --> 00:52:20,300
we, we poked around in hidden hills,
which was beautiful, but it's like,

1015
00:52:20,301 --> 00:52:23,160
you still can't go to like, you know,
Santa Monica, Beverly Hills for dinner.

1016
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:26,900
You just can't, you can't, you just got
to go over the hill, go over to Panga,

1017
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:29,260
get a fucking chopper depending
candy's not bad. Yeah.

1018
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,540
Everybody wants get silly and
tried to go over the four or five.

1019
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:36,620
That's the four or five.
It could be two o'clock in the afternoon,

1020
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:39,450
two o'clock in the morning. It doesn't
matter. It's a fucking hard, yeah,

1021
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:43,340
you always run into packed. They were
doing construction on it the other day.

1022
00:52:43,341 --> 00:52:44,510
It was really late at night.

1023
00:52:44,511 --> 00:52:47,180
Somebody that's my driver is saying over
here was saying Obama came through and

1024
00:52:47,181 --> 00:52:47,910
just like,
right,

1025
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:50,300
right when he got into town was right
when everyone going to work and right when

1026
00:52:50,301 --> 00:52:52,790
he left was when everyone was leaving
work and it just, everything's shut down.

1027
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,360
Really? Yeah. Well when I was
there it wasn't that, it was just,

1028
00:52:56,361 --> 00:53:00,620
they were doing construction and they
had narrowed it down and it fucking two

1029
00:53:00,621 --> 00:53:04,080
o'clock in the morning and it was
just bumper to bumper traffic. No get,

1030
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:06,900
that's why you get ways did
I think there were false,

1031
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,660
they were acquired by Google for like a
billion. It's just brilliant app. Let's a,

1032
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:12,680
he eases pain profits and
that's that simple. I want to,

1033
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:14,900
I don't want to let it slip. Joe, did
you ever hear about sleep? No more.

1034
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,500
What is sleep? No more. It's if next
time you're in New York fucking go.

1035
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,140
It is this interactive theater.
Bear with me.

1036
00:53:21,141 --> 00:53:26,141
It's got this like 1930s kind of speakeasy
vibe about it and it's essentially a

1037
00:53:27,451 --> 00:53:30,450
retelling of Macbeth in the
setting of this old hotel.

1038
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:33,060
And the actors all act around you.

1039
00:53:33,061 --> 00:53:36,060
Everyone has to wear a mask who's not
an actor and you're not allowed to talk

1040
00:53:36,061 --> 00:53:38,640
the whole time.
And they're like,

1041
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:42,150
we find lady Macbeth the after like this
dinner scene and she was like losing

1042
00:53:42,151 --> 00:53:45,900
her shit and she likes strips down and
starts trying to wash the blood off of

1043
00:53:45,901 --> 00:53:47,400
her hands in a tub right in front of you.

1044
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:52,020
And one of my buddies like actually Mondo
interacting in sponge bathing the girl

1045
00:53:52,021 --> 00:53:54,390
like, it's fucking,
there's like the, you know,

1046
00:53:54,391 --> 00:53:59,040
there's a a bellhop there who's like
hooking up with everybody. Um, they don't,

1047
00:53:59,041 --> 00:53:59,730
they're not guys sat,

1048
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:03,440
find a lot of images or videos
of the experience because
it's very low key there.

1049
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,020
I think they're actually bringing
it to La is what, uh, what am I for?

1050
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:09,240
My friends told me other day,
just just go. We went twice.

1051
00:54:09,241 --> 00:54:11,820
The second time was an entirely different
experience and you're just, you know,

1052
00:54:11,821 --> 00:54:14,310
there's like a candy shop there.
You can just dig in and eat the candy.

1053
00:54:14,311 --> 00:54:16,140
There's little like letters,

1054
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:18,330
notes that are part of the fiction
that you can solve yourself.

1055
00:54:18,331 --> 00:54:20,160
It's almost like a video
game that sounds incredible.

1056
00:54:20,161 --> 00:54:22,500
It's not like one of those crazy
ass scary haunted house type things.

1057
00:54:22,501 --> 00:54:26,220
It's not scary. It's just cool. And you
feel like, like our first experience,

1058
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:30,320
we came into this room, it looks
like a World War One type of uh, uh,

1059
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:31,620
hospitals set up.
There's like a,

1060
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:35,370
a nun nurse who's looking very despondent
and she goes up to the window where

1061
00:54:35,371 --> 00:54:36,600
there's like this fake forest they made,

1062
00:54:36,601 --> 00:54:39,300
which was convincing enough to hear
crickets and everything and she just jumps

1063
00:54:39,301 --> 00:54:41,100
out the window and starts running
through the forest. I look over,

1064
00:54:41,101 --> 00:54:41,851
my wife grabbed her hand,

1065
00:54:41,851 --> 00:54:44,010
we just like jumped out the window
and she started following her is fine,

1066
00:54:44,011 --> 00:54:46,080
where she goes and like a whole
tab low played out in front of us.

1067
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:48,510
Fucking phenomenal.
And it's not like,

1068
00:54:48,511 --> 00:54:49,920
not a lot of people know
about it for some reason,

1069
00:54:49,921 --> 00:54:53,400
but tickets aren't that
expensive. You know, you go
there, it opens at a speakeasy.

1070
00:54:53,401 --> 00:54:57,000
There's people who were actors and in
character playing their parts, you know,

1071
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:00,260
that's how it's fun. It's fucking
cool man. And that was really nice.

1072
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:03,460
There's like secret passages and shit.
We were, there's one actress who was uh,

1073
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:04,231
sitting there,

1074
00:55:04,231 --> 00:55:07,770
he's playing out a Tablo on a sofa and
there's one lady who stood in front of

1075
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:10,710
her with a mask on and she grabbed a
lady's hand and pulled her into this like

1076
00:55:10,711 --> 00:55:13,200
closet and I went to follow in.
The door's locked and they were,

1077
00:55:13,201 --> 00:55:15,480
had this some sort of one on
one encounter with the actress.

1078
00:55:15,490 --> 00:55:19,560
Like one during the dinner scene they
were all dancing and one of the actresses

1079
00:55:19,561 --> 00:55:21,900
grabbing, there's one of the guys with
the mask on who was a participant,

1080
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:25,470
just started ballroom dancing with
them. Just like, cool shit man. Wow,

1081
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,320
that's pretty bad ass. Everyone respects
it. People aren't with you learnt Dicks,

1082
00:55:28,321 --> 00:55:31,500
you know, like nobody talks. It's
just cool. It's over in Chelsea.

1083
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,630
I can't recommend it enough.
That sounds really cool.

1084
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:37,950
How long do you think it's going to be
before someone creates some really bad

1085
00:55:37,951 --> 00:55:40,410
ass artificial environment
for like the rift?

1086
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,370
So we're really incredible world
of Warcraft tidewell places.

1087
00:55:44,371 --> 00:55:47,840
The thing is is the biggest mistake
with the rift was putting doom three and

1088
00:55:47,841 --> 00:55:51,780
team fortress on it. Why is that?
Because their games are not made for Vr.

1089
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:55,740
The pacing of the Vr game and like the
the screen Bob and they mount the gun

1090
00:55:55,741 --> 00:55:59,390
moves and everything that can contribute
to nausea, you need to make like a,

1091
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:03,450
a scuba diving sim or space dog fighting
Sim, that kind of thing. Like you know,

1092
00:56:03,451 --> 00:56:06,810
or missed flight game where
you're exploring the island
and mimicking the pain.

1093
00:56:06,811 --> 00:56:08,250
The pacing has got to be a lot slower.

1094
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:12,270
It's like when Bungee put first
person shooters on consoles eco,

1095
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,040
you couldn't have the quake three
ut pacing. They had this, you know,

1096
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,540
master chief jumped very, very slowly.
You know, he didn't run incredibly fast.

1097
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:21,330
Right. And people like took a, you
know, half a clip to take down.

1098
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:23,760
That's how they designed the game
for the console controller. Right.

1099
00:56:23,761 --> 00:56:27,370
It's the same thing for the
rift. And I think, you know,
I'll porn jokes aside man,

1100
00:56:27,371 --> 00:56:28,330
like that I,
you know,

1101
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,970
and that one simulator where I sat
there and looked down and saw my little

1102
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:33,460
virtual legs and I could see that I was
in a space ship and I looked around,

1103
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:36,520
I was like boom. And I, even when I saw
the early version of this, I'm like,

1104
00:56:36,521 --> 00:56:38,880
I want it under this, someone
invest on it. Cause uh, the thought,

1105
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,740
if you probably haven't seen the High
Rez have, you know, if you ever want to,

1106
00:56:41,741 --> 00:56:42,790
you make it out to Orange County,

1107
00:56:42,791 --> 00:56:44,680
I can make an intro and you
can check out the latest stuff.

1108
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:49,450
I've got the low rise a development unit
and it's fun just sitting there playing

1109
00:56:49,451 --> 00:56:50,860
with butterflies and stuff like that.

1110
00:56:50,861 --> 00:56:54,700
But I could see where I got sick just
walking around and that, you know,

1111
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:58,750
and like I had to sit down. But yeah,
they believe right now that, you know,

1112
00:56:58,751 --> 00:57:01,930
the seat of Vr experience is the
ideal one. Right. And you know,

1113
00:57:01,931 --> 00:57:03,280
just they made this,

1114
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:05,860
somebody made this one demo and
they're crowd sourcing the killer app.

1115
00:57:05,861 --> 00:57:06,251
Essentially.

1116
00:57:06,251 --> 00:57:08,740
They're just having developed the
developers who like help solve all the

1117
00:57:08,741 --> 00:57:10,720
problems, which is fucking
brilliant. Just one APP.

1118
00:57:10,721 --> 00:57:12,700
We have to keep your hands on your
keyboard and not move your hands.

1119
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:16,150
And first the fly comes out and cause
you're sitting at a desk and it starts

1120
00:57:16,151 --> 00:57:19,540
bugging you and then all of a sudden
like thousands of fly start like going

1121
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:22,060
around and the three d audio
is fantastic. And so, you know,

1122
00:57:22,061 --> 00:57:24,820
the whole idea is like you want to itch
yourself cause that little thing goes

1123
00:57:24,821 --> 00:57:25,990
off in your head about the bugs,
right?

1124
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,350
Then a velociraptor comes into the room
and just start screaming in your face.

1125
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:31,150
And then, uh, something, I think,

1126
00:57:31,151 --> 00:57:34,160
oh that a spider starts crawling up
your little virtual arm and like, see,

1127
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:35,920
then you can hear it like
chewing on your ear and shit.

1128
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:37,450
You could probably find it on youtube.

1129
00:57:37,451 --> 00:57:38,740
I don't remember what the
fucking thing was called,

1130
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:42,400
but that's kind of cool stuff that they're
doing. Right. Wow. But yeah, that's uh,

1131
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,130
you know,
they,

1132
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:46,120
they solved a lot of the VR issues
with just field of view and they keep

1133
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:50,650
cracking that problem by peeling with
at that onion of what VR is. And, uh,

1134
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:52,240
sooner or later they gonna fully crack it.

1135
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:55,000
And when you see the unreal engine
four demo on that shit and that like,

1136
00:57:55,001 --> 00:57:57,370
there's like this hell night that's like
eight feet tall and stands in front of

1137
00:57:57,371 --> 00:58:00,250
you. I mean, your ass puckers
you can't help it, you know,

1138
00:58:00,251 --> 00:58:02,110
when the snowflakes are falling,
you stick out your tongue,

1139
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,420
you want to like catch them.
It's pretty damn convincing.

1140
00:58:04,421 --> 00:58:07,990
That's why I'm more excited for things
like the rift than I am about next gen

1141
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,290
consoles. It's like, yeah,
it's new consoles and they're
cool and they're better.

1142
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,840
That can hopefully finally just,
you only have one input,

1143
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:17,320
but at the same time they know is not
a lot of great games right now. And uh,

1144
00:58:17,321 --> 00:58:20,020
I'm on Linkedin. It, it'd be
possible to do like unreal,

1145
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:23,530
like to port unreal over
to, uh, to that, well,

1146
00:58:23,531 --> 00:58:25,250
my last words when I left
epic and then when I,

1147
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:27,460
cause it gave the whole
like speech was to a,

1148
00:58:27,461 --> 00:58:31,300
I told him that he shot fees for
closers. Yeah, yeah. ABC Great.

1149
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:34,080
I watched that speak to you about
once every six months. And then, um,

1150
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:37,570
when he pulls up the fucking brass balls,
I told him a reboot,

1151
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:39,190
unreal or unreal tournament,

1152
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:41,980
especially on the first
unreal and unreal engine four.

1153
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,920
Cause the idea for that game was
fucking golden. It's like, oh,

1154
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:46,660
it's the Bermuda triangle of the galaxy.

1155
00:58:46,661 --> 00:58:47,890
So you could do whatever
the hell you want.

1156
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:51,080
And the thing that we
lost a bet that game was,

1157
00:58:51,081 --> 00:58:54,400
it was just as much about exploration and
like a sense of wonder as it was about

1158
00:58:54,401 --> 00:58:56,650
the combat. You know, it felt,
it felt mysterious. You know,

1159
00:58:56,651 --> 00:58:59,890
he had the giant hubs and everything and
had a little bit of, like I told him,

1160
00:58:59,891 --> 00:59:02,200
if they redo it, it would be
essentially [inaudible], you know,

1161
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:05,620
Skyrim that game to introduce
that, but PSI Phi. Right.

1162
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:09,100
It'd be fucking to crush it. Unreal
is a fun game, man. It's really,

1163
00:59:09,101 --> 00:59:09,791
really exciting.

1164
00:59:09,791 --> 00:59:13,940
When it came out the first time you had
to do battle with that crazy dreadlock

1165
00:59:13,941 --> 00:59:16,750
thing was fucking that was, yeah, that was
my whole sequence. I designed that one.

1166
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:21,070
Um, the uh, that was held developing that
game was that, yeah, we were in Waterloo,

1167
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,600
Ontario, Canada, which
is like a college town,

1168
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:26,000
but it didn't have a fun college
town benefits of like cool,

1169
00:59:26,001 --> 00:59:29,270
shitty bar that I saw and I didn't
even, I didn't drink back then. Anyway,

1170
00:59:29,271 --> 00:59:31,490
insert drinking.
I was like 25 and uh,

1171
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:35,600
basically to spend a year on and off up
there from southern California in like,

1172
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:39,380
we've just all just up at digital extremes
working on that game actually. Um,

1173
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:41,640
you know, talking to all of the people
who worked on it, it's like, it was like,

1174
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:43,900
it was our nam or something.
It was like such a to lose,

1175
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:48,320
we're 16 plus hours a day, man.
Like eating the local fast food.

1176
00:59:48,321 --> 00:59:52,280
It was fucking horrible.
This is before Internet porn too.

1177
00:59:52,281 --> 00:59:55,070
So I'd actually go to the quickie Martin.
I'd like pick up those like, you know,

1178
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:59,840
swank and all those like Raunchy
Hazmat at times. Dude, good time.

1179
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:02,270
When I left the apartment complex,
they had rented for us.

1180
01:00:02,271 --> 01:00:06,340
There is a pile of porno magazines
that must've been like that limit.

1181
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:08,980
They're like a thousand of them and I
just left him there for like the land to

1182
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,320
deal. Yeah, they used to,

1183
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:14,360
they used to be the only way you could
get porn either to buy it and he had to

1184
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:17,960
step up like a man and never sound like
that and never found my dad's stash.

1185
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,990
Never ever. I found mine
after, after he died,

1186
01:00:20,991 --> 01:00:23,900
my mom confirmed it and now he's had
those pulling on Max and I'm like, fuck.

1187
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:28,070
Where were they just had like some porno
dungeon probably at a locker. Yeah.

1188
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:30,920
Probably kept them somewhere.
Yeah. Wait from prying eyes.

1189
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:32,030
He didn't have a spanky wary.

1190
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,640
Maybe had like a special hollowed
out logs kept in the woods,

1191
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:39,470
in the woods jail the night look around.
But did you ever find,

1192
01:00:39,471 --> 01:00:40,550
I found support in the woods.

1193
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:43,490
It was France and in the way I did as
something awful thread about that a while

1194
01:00:43,491 --> 01:00:46,510
back that like everybody, every
young men in America, you,

1195
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:49,280
you flip them growing up here, you
found it. And I always said it was,

1196
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:53,720
it was always swank or Rhonchi ass
ones. It was never like playboy. Yeah,

1197
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:56,230
it was always Sherry. Yeah, Dude.

1198
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,460
It's somehow like the subject of
blondish came up the other day.

1199
01:00:58,461 --> 01:01:00,880
I was chatting with a lawn
edge Wantage do you remember,

1200
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:03,780
do you mean Janine Lindemulder
the porn star? She,

1201
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:08,360
she did this whole stripping act with
Juliane where it's just like a much is in

1202
01:01:08,361 --> 01:01:11,000
the nineties you know too much. Listen
to what you're saying. You're saying.

1203
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:14,000
It's like, well, my point is,
have you seen Jeannine lately? No.

1204
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:15,920
Brian can Google that.
Why?

1205
01:01:15,921 --> 01:01:18,410
I'm trying to get this computer because
she was in the cover of the blink when

1206
01:01:18,411 --> 01:01:19,880
any two album.
Remember she had the nurse thing,

1207
01:01:19,881 --> 01:01:24,440
she looked for eight and she was
gorgeous and she baked yet she's just,

1208
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:27,390
I mean, it's rough, man.
I don't want to say it.

1209
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:31,260
I don't want to make fun of the girl.
No, I just, it's, it's sad, man.

1210
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,170
Sorry, I'll start off business. It's
hard out there for porn actresses.

1211
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:39,510
Here's that oculus rift thing that you're
talking about with the spider crabs

1212
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:42,980
here. This is wild, man. Hey Brian.

1213
01:01:42,981 --> 01:01:46,850
What is this thing that this
computer's do one at the bottom. What?

1214
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:50,950
It was like this little bubble that's
telling me everything and macro SX.

1215
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:54,470
It's like voiceover or
something like that. I don't
know what it is. What's that?

1216
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:59,560
It's accessibility. It's probably in your
general settings. He probably hit it.

1217
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:01,040
When you

1218
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:07,970
find out what it's setting us for that
it's that wheelchair or something in the

1219
01:02:07,971 --> 01:02:11,240
settings. Really. That's your Mac
imploding after you spilled your drink on.

1220
01:02:11,241 --> 01:02:15,860
It can't be that. That doesn't
happen. I don't see that.

1221
01:02:15,861 --> 01:02:19,620
Wheelchair settings. What does that
accessibility, where the fuck is that?

1222
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,660
It's probably probably the top.

1223
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:23,040
Okay.

1224
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:26,390
No to, there's a hot key for
it. Yeah. This is probably
a hot key on your keyboard.

1225
01:02:26,391 --> 01:02:30,560
Also. I do not see accessibility
in any of these options.

1226
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:36,650
Users, parental controls? No.
Find out where it is. Man.

1227
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:41,540
This is ridiculous. I'm still on
PC. Do you really? Yeah. Well,

1228
01:02:41,541 --> 01:02:44,900
so we got those a an I'm going
to no way fucking affiliated,

1229
01:02:44,901 --> 01:02:47,840
but we got the razor blade laptops
and like normally when you get a PC,

1230
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,780
the amount of like OEM
bullshit on accessibility.

1231
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:55,370
Like you buy the thing and there's like
8 million like Hewlett Packard desktop

1232
01:02:55,371 --> 01:02:58,670
manager and all sorts of Shit in the
computer just runs terribly and you just

1233
01:02:58,671 --> 01:03:01,220
reformat the damn thing. But this
thing at three icons on the desktop,

1234
01:03:01,221 --> 01:03:05,930
like none of that bullshit.
Uh, here's the, the flies
flying around that does look,

1235
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:10,660
oh, you see fucking crazy. And uh, the,

1236
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:11,890
the five one is what sells it.

1237
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:14,350
The velociraptors are not the
most convincing philosophy.

1238
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:20,290
What do you find when you're talking
about like a good PC build for a laptop?

1239
01:03:20,291 --> 01:03:21,330
Like what,
what is a,

1240
01:03:21,331 --> 01:03:24,490
a company that you go to that has like
the same kind of quality that apple has?

1241
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:29,380
Well, with we'd said I buy power.com and
you had, you had bad luck with it. Yeah,

1242
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,930
I'm honestly, well the, when we
get around to like building it,

1243
01:03:31,931 --> 01:03:33,940
I'm going to just use the wisdom
of the crowd and see what,

1244
01:03:33,941 --> 01:03:34,960
like the Twitter verse says,

1245
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:37,220
so you got to build your own laptop
so when you buy I'm going to,

1246
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,400
I'm going to go to the place where I can
customize and then they ship it to my

1247
01:03:39,401 --> 01:03:39,701
house.

1248
01:03:39,701 --> 01:03:44,320
I'm not going to like write like a Falcon
northwest type of deal or like a real

1249
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:47,770
like hardcore desktop PC. Right. I'm
laying am my eventually going to go,

1250
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,560
I mean just on the laptop right now, but
when you want to do some serious gaming,

1251
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:52,510
like I can play League of legends on it,

1252
01:03:52,511 --> 01:03:54,430
but you know when it comes
down to first person shooters,

1253
01:03:54,431 --> 01:03:57,790
I play the bioshock infinite DLC on my PT,
on my razor blade laptop.

1254
01:03:57,791 --> 01:04:01,160
And it's just like the keys are too
small for the good wasd movement. Right,

1255
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:03,910
right. I mean, you know, my
big, my fucking big fat fingers,

1256
01:04:03,911 --> 01:04:05,860
I'm like accidentally hitting the
wrong buttons. The wrong time.

1257
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:08,970
You make me want to play
games, man, I want to do it.

1258
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:11,770
You've seen that league of legends and
the fact that they had their championship

1259
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:13,210
and they filled the staple center,

1260
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:18,040
like that game is so big
that they basically had a
sporting event. Wait a minute,

1261
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:21,830
they, how long has this game been
out? It's been out a few years. Um,

1262
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:26,380
and they filled the fucking,
yeah, basically this top
down strategy game and a,

1263
01:04:26,381 --> 01:04:30,500
with all these unique characters and
like saying there's not even an investor

1264
01:04:30,501 --> 01:04:32,110
much of a single player
component to the game.

1265
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:35,200
It's more of a multiplayer of strategy
game and people cosplay for it.

1266
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:38,090
They dress up as all the crazy
awesome characters. Yeah.

1267
01:04:38,091 --> 01:04:39,460
There it is at the staple center.

1268
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:44,160
How many of you guys seen some of
the hype videos for the performance?

1269
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,090
How many of you guys know that?
Where's,

1270
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:50,410
I think it was a couple of Korean
kids wound up winning. This is insane.

1271
01:04:50,650 --> 01:04:54,630
Look at the size of that fucking crowd
free there to watch people play games

1272
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:58,120
free to play game.
How much did they pay to get in there?

1273
01:04:58,121 --> 01:04:59,380
To Watch people play a game?
Uh,

1274
01:04:59,390 --> 01:05:01,870
I don't know how much it
was for tickets for that,

1275
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:04,870
but I'm guess everyone's cheering
and shit, dude. It's, it's,

1276
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:09,790
wow, we're in a movie,
right? We're in a movie.

1277
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,710
And so that game was
pitched at ea years ago and,

1278
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:18,010
and ea basically laughed him out of
the room and now just crushing it.

1279
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:20,920
They're hiring like everybody,
all the developers in La and like,

1280
01:05:20,921 --> 01:05:23,650
they make these awesome cinematics
also to support their, uh,

1281
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,540
kind of what the Ip is
and what the universe is.

1282
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:29,560
And then crazy characters like I'm playing
as this like little girl who has like,

1283
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:34,620
um, she can pirate telekinesis
or whatever, you know,
firestarter shit. And um,

1284
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:37,480
she has this like little bear with her
little stuffed bear and like through

1285
01:05:37,481 --> 01:05:41,100
magic, the bear becomes giant flaming
and a tax people. And I mean, it's a,

1286
01:05:41,101 --> 01:05:43,660
it's an incredibly deep game. Wow. Every,

1287
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:46,090
everybody has a giant stiffy
feed the concept of e sports.

1288
01:05:46,091 --> 01:05:47,920
Now they want to make an esport
game. And it's like, dude,

1289
01:05:48,310 --> 01:05:52,060
you have to make a great air tight game
first before you could ever consider

1290
01:05:52,061 --> 01:05:56,390
even doing that. But I mean it's
beautiful graphics. Oh, it's,

1291
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:59,440
it's got that it just beautiful
art style. Right. And, um,

1292
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:02,320
I think they're about to move into a new
facility that got to be up to like four

1293
01:06:02,321 --> 01:06:05,860
or 500 people. Easy. God dammit.
It's old John that they call it.

1294
01:06:05,861 --> 01:06:10,240
The mobile is like, uh, what was
it? Online battle arena and um,

1295
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,580
that whole genre is just huge these days.

1296
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:15,640
I just could still shoot her guy
if they can. Yeah, I am as well.

1297
01:06:15,670 --> 01:06:18,880
I can tell you if I, if I'm
able to get a studio going, uh,

1298
01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:21,310
want to make a PC shooter,

1299
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:25,120
like that's like let's Sony and Microsoft
fight it off for the next few years

1300
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:28,660
and you know, the, the Pc, you know, you
know as well as I do Joe Communities,

1301
01:06:28,661 --> 01:06:33,430
everything, right? Like it's so much
of it is like creating your own,

1302
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:34,570
you know,
religion,

1303
01:06:34,571 --> 01:06:38,530
your own brand and the pcs where
the community gathers for Reddit,

1304
01:06:38,531 --> 01:06:41,650
for youtube videos, for everything.
And you can have some of that.

1305
01:06:41,690 --> 01:06:44,470
They were working on it with consoles, but
you know, the PC is not going anywhere.

1306
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:48,250
Well, you know what, you can't fuck with
the accuracy of the mouse. You just can't.

1307
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:51,040
They tried. I've seen all those
other things fucked with them.

1308
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:53,890
They can't mess with a really good mouse.

1309
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:58,690
And keyboard is just the such for CISE
movement, the way he can move around.

1310
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,450
You get that muscle memory and people
are just popping off head shots.

1311
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:05,680
I mean it's, I mean, especially getting a
little older, it gets a little harder. Um,

1312
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:08,530
but it's uh, it's fucking awesome
and like that type of thing.

1313
01:07:08,531 --> 01:07:11,500
Translating to pro is just
compelling to me. Yeah. People like,

1314
01:07:11,501 --> 01:07:14,050
I've had conversations with people that
I can't believe you were addicted to.

1315
01:07:14,051 --> 01:07:16,330
Games are so stupid. I
mean, you could, you know,

1316
01:07:16,331 --> 01:07:19,300
it's just a story that somebody wrote.
I don't think you get it.

1317
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:21,190
Like when you're playing multiplayer,

1318
01:07:21,191 --> 01:07:24,550
what you're doing is you're
engaged in this fast twitch,

1319
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:26,320
very realistic,

1320
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:30,890
hyper sensate sensation filled experience.

1321
01:07:30,910 --> 01:07:32,500
It's good for you.
And in the back of your head,

1322
01:07:32,501 --> 01:07:35,620
your brain's compiling the code
of the day. This is good for you.

1323
01:07:35,621 --> 01:07:40,440
Sounds like a crack dealer. The
first one's free. You're a dealer.

1324
01:07:40,441 --> 01:07:43,450
Klutzy beats is that one of their awesome
cinematics they put up for the game

1325
01:07:43,451 --> 01:07:45,910
and it's just like where you got kind of
get to know that gambit looking guy and

1326
01:07:45,911 --> 01:07:50,010
then there's, it's bad ass
fucking awesome graphics. Yeah.

1327
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:53,200
That's west Borland. He's in the
game. Right. Cause it looks like,

1328
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:58,150
it looks like one of the outfits that
he wears West Portland, the guy from um,

1329
01:07:58,550 --> 01:08:03,310
a limp Bizkit that bad ass bass player,
guitar player,

1330
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:07,410
whatever it is wouldn't things. But
yeah, so a lot of people right now are,

1331
01:08:07,411 --> 01:08:10,000
they are trying to get into that whole
thing with that genre and they're just

1332
01:08:10,001 --> 01:08:14,020
like, dude at that point like blizzard's
coming out with a game and the genre and

1333
01:08:14,021 --> 01:08:15,920
blizzard I think is going to
have a shot at doing well.

1334
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:19,370
But everybody else
initially, dude. Wow. Yeah.

1335
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:23,120
If you're the fifth one in then you know
you're gonna wind up being like the is

1336
01:08:23,121 --> 01:08:24,890
cola to Pepsi and coke and all that.

1337
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:28,130
If you could figure out a way
to use an Omni directional,

1338
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:33,240
like one of those circular treadmills
and a really good accurate gun that you

1339
01:08:34,521 --> 01:08:37,460
actually hold and carry with a strap
that you put over your shoulder.

1340
01:08:37,461 --> 01:08:39,950
They have that dude, did they really
have something really good though?

1341
01:08:39,951 --> 01:08:43,450
Like a game? They haven't made a game
for you. It's called the Omni. Um,

1342
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:44,750
I got to use it at comicon.

1343
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:48,380
And what it does is essentially you're
strapped into your waist and you don't go

1344
01:08:48,381 --> 01:08:52,280
anywhere and it's a super slippery floor
that's kind of a bowl and you put on

1345
01:08:52,281 --> 01:08:54,110
these special shoes that are
super slick and if you didn't,

1346
01:08:54,111 --> 01:08:56,300
if you weren't strapped in,
you fall, fall right over.

1347
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:59,300
But because you're strapped in,
you have the illusion of walking again.

1348
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:02,900
I was full and running on the thing
playing halflife two. Um, again,

1349
01:09:02,901 --> 01:09:06,260
the problem with that was the pacing of
halflife two is done for a person who

1350
01:09:06,261 --> 01:09:08,720
just holds WASD and
whips their mouse around.

1351
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:12,200
And if you just try and dump it on
the rift with the Omni, it's just,

1352
01:09:12,201 --> 01:09:14,970
it's an exhausting experience where
you're lucky to get three kills there.

1353
01:09:14,990 --> 01:09:18,870
It sounds like someone's a pussy.
Fucking get in shape and chief hat,

1354
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:22,880
this is awesome. This is what I needed
in my life. This would change me,

1355
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:27,280
this kind of shit. We'll fucking change
me. So they, that's a workout man. Yeah,

1356
01:09:27,281 --> 01:09:28,490
we're getting some wicked shape do.

1357
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,820
We did a Kickstarter for that and they
raised a bunch of money and I Amandla

1358
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,270
where do you, where do I put
away my credit card information?

1359
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:38,240
That's fucking bad ass
man. I love it. Yeah. So,

1360
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:42,490
and it totally takes up a small footprint
in like your room, right? Ah. So it's a,

1361
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:45,740
it's, it's cool man. It's just, it,
it right now for the time being,

1362
01:09:45,741 --> 01:09:48,290
I think seated VR is the way to go
until they solve all the problems.

1363
01:09:48,291 --> 01:09:50,480
Like it's like walk before you run.
Like let's, let's figure it out.

1364
01:09:50,481 --> 01:09:54,410
Just regular Vr Dad, I want to run, I
want to run with a gun. Let's do this.

1365
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:57,740
What are you saying? I'm not falling
over bitch, you might follower.

1366
01:09:57,770 --> 01:10:00,680
I'm not going to fall over. No, no.
When you have that, those God was on,

1367
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:03,860
I mean I was just trying to like grab a
butterfly at one point and like, whoa.

1368
01:10:03,861 --> 01:10:06,790
You like lose yourself cause
it's kind of like a, it's,

1369
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:10,310
it tricks your mind into thinking you're
actually disorienting and the low rise

1370
01:10:10,311 --> 01:10:12,860
makes sense. The low Rez, when it
has a screen door type look on it.

1371
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:16,210
The High Rez one, it's like, it's
great. And I mean, you know, the,

1372
01:10:16,211 --> 01:10:18,830
the tech technology only gonna get
lighter. It's gonna get better faster,

1373
01:10:18,831 --> 01:10:19,491
the whole nine yards.

1374
01:10:19,491 --> 01:10:23,810
So it's just that it would like at this
stage of the game that they would come

1375
01:10:23,811 --> 01:10:25,460
up with something like that.
It's like,

1376
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:28,280
well VR was supposed to be the big thing
in the 90s right? Man, lawnmower man,

1377
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:30,530
his lawnmower man.

1378
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:34,070
I thought the graphics in that movie
was so awesome and they don't hold up at

1379
01:10:34,071 --> 01:10:34,341
all.

1380
01:10:34,341 --> 01:10:38,760
But one more man is another one of those
Stephen King books that became like, ah,

1381
01:10:38,761 --> 01:10:42,530
an okay movie. But God damn, that book
was bad. I never actually read the book.

1382
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:43,790
It's fucking great.
I mean,

1383
01:10:43,791 --> 01:10:47,360
cause this is the whole William Gibson
Cyber punk thing and it's like, dude,

1384
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:50,900
do you know how many years it's
been since the Matrix? Like it's,

1385
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:53,690
I think it was 98,
99 and the SQL never happened.

1386
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:58,160
Well the sequels that did happen
are terrible. Yeah. What is, uh,

1387
01:10:58,490 --> 01:11:01,150
who is this Doug Benson?
That's right. Yeah,

1388
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,770
it was stone and he was like
getting sick on it. Dude.

1389
01:11:03,771 --> 01:11:06,260
You saw the viral video of
the little old lady who, uh,

1390
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:09,920
put it on and she's just like, am
like wow. Meet CNN and everything.

1391
01:11:09,921 --> 01:11:10,371
Like she's like,

1392
01:11:10,371 --> 01:11:14,350
did you go to Tuscany to make this and
all this stuff because they have a demo

1393
01:11:14,351 --> 01:11:16,290
where you're kind of, you're
in, you're in Tuscany. Right?

1394
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:20,070
It's just virtual reality stuff. But
she was so convincing to her. It's like,

1395
01:11:20,071 --> 01:11:23,550
think about just, you know, the non gaming
applications of the shit. Like imagine,

1396
01:11:23,551 --> 01:11:24,570
you know, if, you know,

1397
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:27,450
you have a travel app where you can
just go and experience like, you know,

1398
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:31,080
Venice or Tuscany or whatever. Right?
That kind of thing. For virtual tourism,

1399
01:11:31,081 --> 01:11:31,831
right?
Well,

1400
01:11:31,831 --> 01:11:35,400
that's going to be what movies are not
going to go to a movie and sit in front

1401
01:11:35,401 --> 01:11:36,330
of a screen like a dummy.

1402
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:38,790
Not Everybody can afford to
have a theater room or a big TV.

1403
01:11:38,791 --> 01:11:41,910
So imagine if you're like a college kid
and you want to watch a movie in Imax,

1404
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:43,410
you know,
you put this on and it's,

1405
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:45,750
they have actually have a
theater demo where you're like,

1406
01:11:45,751 --> 01:11:48,460
you can look around and see
the seats next to you and it's,

1407
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:52,140
there's a big screen in front of you and
it's, you feel like you're at an imax.

1408
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:56,220
I could totally see that and I could
see you being in a virtual reality where

1409
01:11:56,221 --> 01:12:00,090
you're in a movie theater watching a
movie and everything goes horribly wrong.

1410
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:03,690
And you look around the theater and
you see zombies Werewolf's and shit.

1411
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:07,950
I could imagine they could make a
pretty God damn immersive experience.

1412
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:10,880
I knew a guy who is making
a game for the rift and uh,

1413
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:13,160
his demo was basically that
you're playing a, you're,

1414
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:16,270
you're sitting on a sofa
playing a video game on your TV,

1415
01:12:16,271 --> 01:12:19,520
in the virtual environment and then weird
shit in your inner ear and your, your,

1416
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:20,400
your fake living room.

1417
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:22,920
And then it's like a dark and stormy
night and then weird shit starts happening

1418
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:23,754
all around you.

1419
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:27,330
That would be dope as fuck if they had
a theater where you're sitting there in

1420
01:12:27,331 --> 01:12:29,820
your seat and in the theater,

1421
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:34,910
your seat goes down into the floor and
out pops an Omni directional track like

1422
01:12:35,281 --> 01:12:35,910
that thing,

1423
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:40,670
whatever the fuck all on mill
Omni treadmill and then you,

1424
01:12:40,671 --> 01:12:44,910
you pick up a gun that's on the treadmill
and everybody gets locked in and you

1425
01:12:44,911 --> 01:12:49,800
all like Eh, are interactive in the movie
together, stormed the beach, you know,

1426
01:12:49,801 --> 01:12:52,350
fucking wild.
That would be mad if they,

1427
01:12:52,351 --> 01:12:55,510
I mean it would be a completely
different kind of entertainment.

1428
01:12:55,511 --> 01:12:56,281
And one of the problems,

1429
01:12:56,281 --> 01:13:00,090
the a movie where you go and sit down
or games are too fucking scary on it.

1430
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:04,160
Oh I bet. Right. Cause when you turn and
like, you know, monsters right there.

1431
01:13:04,190 --> 01:13:06,450
Did you guys ever play slender man?
You'd have a heart attack.

1432
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:10,800
What is slender man? Uh, it's PC,
first person, little mini games.

1433
01:13:10,801 --> 01:13:11,760
So there's this whole,
you know,

1434
01:13:11,761 --> 01:13:13,350
they'll all the internet
memes and things like that.

1435
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:16,380
A few years ago this became like a thing
where like the Internet created this

1436
01:13:16,381 --> 01:13:20,100
mythos of the slick, creepy, skinny,
scary dude. And whenever he'd show up,

1437
01:13:20,101 --> 01:13:21,060
the kids would vanish,
right?

1438
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:24,840
And someone made this little game called
slender man that you can download and

1439
01:13:24,841 --> 01:13:27,450
it's essentially you have to go find
ate scraps of paper that are, and it's,

1440
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:28,020
you know,

1441
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:30,360
they're random where they're going to
be and it's a dark night and you have a

1442
01:13:30,361 --> 01:13:31,560
flashlight in your,
in a forest.

1443
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:35,070
And if you basically see slender man and
you look at them from too long, you die.

1444
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,490
And so what happens is nothing, nothing
happens at first. It's real quiet.

1445
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:40,740
And you'll get, you'll get the first
piece and all a sudden you start hearing

1446
01:13:43,150 --> 01:13:46,410
this like factory, like pounding starts.
It's very ominous. And then he, you know,

1447
01:13:46,411 --> 01:13:48,780
you turn around and, and at the
end of the, he first shows up,

1448
01:13:48,781 --> 01:13:50,410
like at the end of the road,
he's like any,

1449
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:53,520
you just can barely see this really
skinny, creepy guy. And then they'll,

1450
01:13:53,521 --> 01:13:55,800
they'll deliberately like put them
around corners and like there's,

1451
01:13:55,801 --> 01:13:58,260
there's a part we have to go in like a
little warehouse to get a piece of paper.

1452
01:13:58,261 --> 01:14:01,890
And the pacing of it is so wild on
this entire youtube videos of people's

1453
01:14:01,891 --> 01:14:03,150
reactions to slender man,

1454
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:07,840
like falling off their chair and
the graphics are simple. His shifts.

1455
01:14:08,590 --> 01:14:10,200
I was worried about really skinny people.

1456
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:11,980
I guess it's cause
they're fucking hungry as

1457
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,440
shit and they're willing to get
desperate. What's that? That,

1458
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:17,620
that that goes back to the, the grays, the
alien thing, right? Like that's skinny,

1459
01:14:17,621 --> 01:14:22,360
slender ice thing, right? Yeah. I can some
things, but this is a person, right? Yeah.

1460
01:14:22,361 --> 01:14:25,330
The quality of this video, it looks like
sound like a commodore 64 right? Now.

1461
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:29,290
Remember that video that somebody made
where it was like Johnny or something

1462
01:14:29,291 --> 01:14:33,520
like that? It was a, uh, like a little
alien rubber thing. Rubber Johnny. Yeah.

1463
01:14:33,521 --> 01:14:36,370
What was that? That was a, it was
a viral promotion for something.

1464
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:39,670
It's like an la based artist.
Really stirring it up. Pull that up.

1465
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:42,820
That was rubber John. It was
pretty upsetting. It's weird man.

1466
01:14:42,821 --> 01:14:45,580
It was one of the weirdest things I
think I've ever seen on I got under your

1467
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:47,780
skin. Yeah, right. It's like that kind of,

1468
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,670
that's why I like insidious is one of
my favorite horror movies. Cause the,

1469
01:14:50,671 --> 01:14:54,100
a lot of the heart har references in
it. Subtle here. See that one? Yes.

1470
01:14:54,101 --> 01:14:56,890
James wan and the scene where
um, the, ah, the mother,

1471
01:14:56,980 --> 01:15:00,100
they think they're free of the haunting
and they're at the new house and then

1472
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:02,800
the tiptoe through the tulips
starts playing. Yeah. This is,

1473
01:15:02,801 --> 01:15:06,850
if this was like on Fox News and
past as like some alien film,

1474
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:10,390
people would remember when alien
autopsy was out of the box. Totally

1475
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:13,330
dating. Like, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

1476
01:15:13,331 --> 01:15:17,350
What did you just really make me watch
35 minutes a TV to show me a rubber suit.

1477
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:20,620
They're not going to fucking
find big foot. Quit looking.

1478
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:23,740
See My tweets from last night.
No. Oh my God. I was going crazy.

1479
01:15:23,741 --> 01:15:27,790
I was watching big finding big foot and
uh, I was, I was getting mad, you know,

1480
01:15:27,791 --> 01:15:30,190
cause they were talking crazy shit.
And uh,

1481
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:34,330
they had this woman on and they were like,
she's a pull up this picture of Brian,

1482
01:15:34,331 --> 01:15:38,530
if you can see,
it's like the woman says Kelly,

1483
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,440
they talking about how they found big
for the, like Kelly's very artistic.

1484
01:15:41,441 --> 01:15:45,580
So she decided to sketch what we saw
that day and she unveiled this fucking

1485
01:15:45,581 --> 01:15:47,530
picked click on the picture though,
so you could really see it.

1486
01:15:47,770 --> 01:15:52,600
She unveils this picture. Wow. And
you know, she's Kelly's very artistic.

1487
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:55,690
This is what she decided to. So the
fucking guy, the big foot expert,

1488
01:15:55,691 --> 01:15:57,940
he sees that picture. He goes, wow,

1489
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,280
that's anything other than
the worst piece of shit,

1490
01:16:04,281 --> 01:16:05,810
big foot drawing and it history.

1491
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:09,950
It looks like the man and the wing
from the twilight zone, it's worse.

1492
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:12,700
The man on the wing was more
realistic and he looked like a furry.

1493
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,490
That is one of the worst
drawings of all time. You know,

1494
01:16:16,491 --> 01:16:20,330
they should have said like,
oh, that's interesting. But
instead they're like, wow,

1495
01:16:20,390 --> 01:16:23,140
dude. I had a friend send
me a photo years ago, uh,

1496
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:26,720
to the characters that jazz jackrabbit
game I made that w happened to be,

1497
01:16:26,721 --> 01:16:28,360
she was staying at a hotel
that happened to be happening.

1498
01:16:28,361 --> 01:16:31,730
A having a furry convention was,
that was her story. Anyway, and uh,

1499
01:16:31,731 --> 01:16:35,080
there were two people dressed as these
characters as furries that I had created.

1500
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:37,430
I'm like, that's
hilarious. What if I done,

1501
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:41,530
we were in Pittsburgh once accidentally
and it was a coincided with a furry

1502
01:16:41,531 --> 01:16:43,930
convention.
We were there for the UFC and the,

1503
01:16:43,931 --> 01:16:47,110
all the hotels were taken up and they
had a hard time finding hotel rooms for

1504
01:16:47,111 --> 01:16:49,840
fighters and people because they
were all taken up by furries.

1505
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:52,060
And when we were at this one hotel,

1506
01:16:52,061 --> 01:16:55,150
the guy told us that the people that
were there that were staying asked him to

1507
01:16:55,151 --> 01:16:59,290
put a litter box in the lobby
so they could shit in the lobby.

1508
01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:03,260
Wow. That's, that's, that's some
dedication. He said that they were like,

1509
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:06,070
they're basically the guys, our argument
was, look for this whole weekend,

1510
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:09,190
it's all fairies. And he tried to
say, look, it's not all furries.

1511
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,760
We have regular guests here too.
And they're like,

1512
01:17:10,761 --> 01:17:13,340
we'll put it in the corner
and it only be for like,

1513
01:17:13,341 --> 01:17:15,490
they wanted to be able
to shit in a letter box.

1514
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:18,890
I mean maybe the guy was trolling,
but I don't think so. I mean,

1515
01:17:18,891 --> 01:17:20,500
I'm not saying the guy who told me this,
I'm saying the guard,

1516
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:23,330
I mean because they have little lake holes
that they could fuck through in their

1517
01:17:23,331 --> 01:17:27,050
suits. But so then what it yet that's the
tattoo. I um, I remember who got that.

1518
01:17:27,051 --> 01:17:30,880
It was at that goes, uh, that's this jazz.
That's the thing. That's what, you know,

1519
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:31,850
dude,
that's what I miss.

1520
01:17:32,210 --> 01:17:36,620
What people getting tattoos of stuff I
came up with that was the biggest like

1521
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:39,730
gas like and you know I,
I met this summer,

1522
01:17:39,731 --> 01:17:44,450
I was at a Pax East conference in Boston
and it's like really normal looking

1523
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:47,660
hipster girl comes up to me and pulls up
beside of her shirt and she had written

1524
01:17:47,661 --> 01:17:52,320
the oath that the gears took or like
tattooed on her side and I just,

1525
01:17:52,330 --> 01:17:54,950
I I came up that shit on
like a Tuesday like Ah,

1526
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:56,750
rod needs this for the okay cool.

1527
01:17:56,751 --> 01:17:59,900
And like the in the in like the the key
or stamp and it's like if you Google

1528
01:17:59,901 --> 01:18:00,830
gears,
tattoos,

1529
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:01,660
Brian,

1530
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:06,660
it may maybe a very strange nerd gas
them when you come on that that thing,

1531
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:10,980
she has that thing written on the side
of her body. You shoot a load on that.

1532
01:18:10,981 --> 01:18:15,210
If you're like a real super nerd and
you're banging a chick hot check has got

1533
01:18:15,211 --> 01:18:17,390
that tattooed on our side.
Like wow,

1534
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:21,210
must be pretty intense orgasm the whole
generation of girls now that just grew

1535
01:18:21,211 --> 01:18:23,160
up playing games and it's no big deal now.
Yeah.

1536
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:26,190
What were we talking about right before
that there was something we were talking

1537
01:18:26,191 --> 01:18:29,150
about where I was going to
the litter box and the forest.

1538
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:33,690
So the guy told me that not only did they
do that is these are all gears tattoos

1539
01:18:33,691 --> 01:18:35,860
were showing on the
eastern versus raising.

1540
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:38,580
Not only did the guy say
that they wanted that,

1541
01:18:38,581 --> 01:18:40,830
but they also wanted to be fed and bowls.

1542
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:44,790
They wanted them to bring bowls up to uh,
the room,

1543
01:18:44,791 --> 01:18:47,070
like their food so they can
eat on the ground like a dog.

1544
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:50,850
So I've seen the furry outfits
haven't tried, went on,

1545
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:53,920
but how do you like there's
gotta be a mouth hole and,

1546
01:18:53,921 --> 01:18:57,090
and for the whole back thing,
like you have to a trap door,

1547
01:18:57,150 --> 01:19:01,960
like the old school minor
underwear, right? Oh yeah, yeah.

1548
01:19:02,010 --> 01:19:04,290
But then you can't shit in the litter box
and you have to take off the, depends.

1549
01:19:04,291 --> 01:19:06,150
Take off your furry off it and then
drop the shit in the letterbox.

1550
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:09,270
It's a matter of sure.
Defend the pens like a last ditch effort.

1551
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:13,530
If you can't figure out how to get the
suit off and imagine like did have this

1552
01:19:13,531 --> 01:19:14,750
clean very often like the,

1553
01:19:14,751 --> 01:19:18,840
the stench of the sweat and every ladies
you could get will usable it's west

1554
01:19:18,841 --> 01:19:22,340
best way a fair enough.
The um,

1555
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:26,010
the people that were staying there,
which we're working there,

1556
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:28,530
whether it was interesting because it
wasn't just one person that was telling us

1557
01:19:28,531 --> 01:19:29,364
his stories,

1558
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:32,130
it was like one guy came over and told
us about the litter box and another guy

1559
01:19:32,131 --> 01:19:35,640
came over and told us about bowls and
they want to be served in bowls and they

1560
01:19:35,641 --> 01:19:38,640
were all living might be legit then it
was just one dude or isn't enough legit.

1561
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:42,780
I think there's something no one's
telling you not to be a fairy.

1562
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:44,280
I just want to get that
out there right now.

1563
01:19:44,281 --> 01:19:47,640
I don't have any judgment on furries.
Whatever works for you.

1564
01:19:47,850 --> 01:19:49,350
If you enjoy doing it,
who cares?

1565
01:19:49,530 --> 01:19:54,530
But I would imagine that a lot of people
that like to be anonymous like that

1566
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:58,740
also have some other peculiar quirks.
I,

1567
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,000
has anybody ever done a study?

1568
01:20:00,001 --> 01:20:03,000
I've always wondered like where
does that fascination start?

1569
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:07,530
There's oof fucking know, right? Like
your humping her teddy bear as kid

1570
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,720
could be.
Don't like people.

1571
01:20:09,721 --> 01:20:13,050
People been mean to you and you wish
you lived in a world of cartoons,

1572
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:17,250
some playful, childish world where
you just don't even see people's face.

1573
01:20:17,251 --> 01:20:21,780
He just pull on the hatch and bang them.
That's brownies are the creepiest ones.

1574
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:24,570
These grown men that love
like my little pony. You know,

1575
01:20:24,571 --> 01:20:26,820
I didn't even know about that until
that show we did the other night.

1576
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,240
Some guy pulled it out.
I have it.

1577
01:20:28,350 --> 01:20:31,710
I had a my little pony doll in my pocket
because I have a three year old. Yeah.

1578
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,150
He just told me to hold up.
You still have it.

1579
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:37,480
I gave it to her and give
her back to her. But um, um,

1580
01:20:37,530 --> 01:20:40,350
someone said that there's a bunch of men
who were into my little pony and they

1581
01:20:40,351 --> 01:20:41,390
call him bronies.
I mean,

1582
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:44,460
I can't believe I didn't know about
maybe I did know and I just refused.

1583
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:48,020
There's so much stuff there's ever hit
her about the utility kilt. Utila kilt.

1584
01:20:48,050 --> 01:20:50,100
Yeah. It's like a kilts that
has all these pockets and shit.

1585
01:20:50,101 --> 01:20:51,090
And they sell them at comicon.

1586
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,600
It's like a thing there's like
dudes are wearing around. Yeah.

1587
01:20:53,790 --> 01:20:57,210
So underneath nothing, just balls assuming
nothing. That's like the greatest,

1588
01:20:57,211 --> 01:20:59,370
like what do you think's what's under
there? What do you think's under there?

1589
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:02,540
Yeah, they uh, they have been doing
that for years. You see this shit.

1590
01:21:02,541 --> 01:21:05,340
So how the conventions,
I think it's so they can collect swag.

1591
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:09,480
If you're a guy walking around in a skirt
with no underwear on, that's so hack.

1592
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:12,540
Huh?
Cause girls had been doing that forever.

1593
01:21:12,541 --> 01:21:15,280
It's like you're stealing their thunder.
Fair enough. I'll tell it to them.

1594
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:18,330
My Scottish friends, yeah, they were
actually probably doing it before skirts,

1595
01:21:18,331 --> 01:21:19,164
right?
Yeah.

1596
01:21:19,230 --> 01:21:21,930
I've had Scottish friends who told me
they wear the kilt out and they get more

1597
01:21:21,931 --> 01:21:24,660
attention from girls to grabbing
their balls all night. Really?

1598
01:21:24,790 --> 01:21:27,960
How they're hanging around with dirty
bitches. Watch a ball grabbing wenches.

1599
01:21:27,961 --> 01:21:32,420
That's what I say. Where are they? This
is taking place. Band named the ball.

1600
01:21:32,421 --> 01:21:34,410
Having the winches should and if it's not,

1601
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:36,900
please make it so you could still make it.

1602
01:21:36,901 --> 01:21:39,990
So they were all touch tunes out at some
of the bars around here. What does that,

1603
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:43,050
it's basically looks like a giant iPhone
in the wall and then you can play music

1604
01:21:43,051 --> 01:21:44,760
through your phone for free for a fee,

1605
01:21:44,761 --> 01:21:48,090
but you can pay to like twice the feed
of plate. Make your song playing next.

1606
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:51,620
It's fucking awesome. Really genius.
Every song. That's fascinating.

1607
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:55,590
We will go to like a redneck bars and
like play the most non southern music.

1608
01:21:56,310 --> 01:21:59,900
We were at one and we put on a
electric six this gay bar. Oh Man.

1609
01:21:59,930 --> 01:22:02,550
Like the locals didn't know about the APP
and they were trying to figure out why

1610
01:22:02,551 --> 01:22:06,540
isn't it playing like my music.
I will not take it to a gay bar.

1611
01:22:09,010 --> 01:22:12,480
And then we put them Brittany and
why does it work? Who controls it?

1612
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:17,340
The person who there's basically a song
queue and then you can interrupt it.

1613
01:22:17,970 --> 01:22:21,780
Yeah. Yeah. Basically if you pay extra
to make your song next, then you're next.

1614
01:22:21,781 --> 01:22:25,470
Yeah. It's a total dick move. It's, it's
great cause there's that guy named gamble.

1615
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:28,620
Highly loved this guy who I'd
recommend looking at Mommy's on spot.

1616
01:22:28,621 --> 01:22:32,310
It sounds like a big black
porn star with a cowboy hat.

1617
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:34,000
He has names gambling.

1618
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:38,430
He has this song about gambling and fuck
and you and your mouth boy is a song

1619
01:22:38,431 --> 01:22:41,580
called balls in your butthole.
Anything play that song really loud it.

1620
01:22:41,581 --> 01:22:44,920
Most bars you can just sit there
and just love life. Look there.

1621
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:47,490
It's called dogs in a bathtub.
Ball's in your book. I'm saying,

1622
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:51,030
but the act of doing that is called
Doggie in the bathtub because it's hard to

1623
01:22:51,031 --> 01:22:54,670
keep the dog in the bathtub.
Doggie in the bathtub. I might,

1624
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,760
my buddy of vo that one time.
Um,

1625
01:22:56,761 --> 01:23:00,090
I don't understand that Doggie in the
bathtub because it's hard to keep a dog in

1626
01:23:00,091 --> 01:23:00,511
the bathroom,

1627
01:23:00,511 --> 01:23:03,660
but it's not hard to use that APP and
turn the music on while I was talking

1628
01:23:03,661 --> 01:23:06,030
about putting your balls
and someone's ass. Oh,

1629
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:08,600
okay.
He's the shit out of me.

1630
01:23:08,610 --> 01:23:11,950
There's videos up that if you look at
the Google guys videos of guys putting

1631
01:23:11,951 --> 01:23:15,940
balls in someone's arrows buttholes while
fucking him. Yeah. Yeah. Putting them in.

1632
01:23:16,030 --> 01:23:20,440
I still have friends that don't know
Google it. You'll eat the pickle jar.

1633
01:23:21,870 --> 01:23:25,540
I don't pick a job routine. We're not the
guy's ass. And then it broke. Oh yeah.

1634
01:23:25,541 --> 01:23:28,670
One guy. One girl. It's rough.
Whatever it is. One guy. One Cup. Yeah.

1635
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:31,030
That's one of the roughest I
ways to deal with that guy.

1636
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:34,120
The chunks and interview.
He survived it. Yeah.

1637
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:36,400
I heard it was a breakaway
glass that they use.

1638
01:23:36,630 --> 01:23:40,510
I would like the fake stuff for the
movies. Really interesting. Are you sure?

1639
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:44,230
That's what it's really heard.
Yeah, but candy glass, right?
This, this, I heard shit.

1640
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:48,760
It's not good enough.
In 2013 Mr Reichel BME is fake.

1641
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:53,530
No, some of it wasn't fake. That
video was, no. Some of it all.

1642
01:23:53,531 --> 01:23:54,930
It was all BME.
Paint.

1643
01:23:54,931 --> 01:23:59,640
Olympics was was a series of images that
people had gathered up online and taken

1644
01:23:59,650 --> 01:24:00,760
and put it into a video.

1645
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:04,840
As far as was it a real pain Olympics
like people were like practicing to see

1646
01:24:04,841 --> 01:24:07,870
who could cut off the mostly
wind? Definitely not. It was just,

1647
01:24:08,050 --> 01:24:12,820
they called it the BME paint Olympics
because BME was a website that was around

1648
01:24:12,821 --> 01:24:17,360
for Shannon Lariat. The guy who ran it
was a friend of mine online. We interact,

1649
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:20,590
I think he died without all the categories
of crazy buddy modification, right?

1650
01:24:20,591 --> 01:24:22,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm
pretty sure he died. Um,

1651
01:24:22,990 --> 01:24:27,010
but he was very friendly online and he
sent me a free membership wants when I

1652
01:24:27,011 --> 01:24:31,770
wrote a blog about, um, I forget what
it was. Something about, you know,

1653
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:33,640
me being curious about body modification,

1654
01:24:33,641 --> 01:24:36,730
like all these different weird
things that people do like, you know,

1655
01:24:36,731 --> 01:24:39,460
like put plates in their lips
and different tribal shit.

1656
01:24:39,550 --> 01:24:42,700
So he sent me all the really extreme
shit that he has on his website,

1657
01:24:42,701 --> 01:24:45,010
which just like dudes Cox
split down the middle,

1658
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:48,910
this is all like way before you'd
get this from a Google search,

1659
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:53,220
like you had to know like
not style projects project.

1660
01:24:53,230 --> 01:24:54,640
This was exactly what I was going to say.

1661
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:59,160
I found out about him from style project
and uh, I find the older, right. Again,

1662
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:01,420
I can't live like when I hit my thirties
I can't look at that shit anymore.

1663
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:03,040
Well you know what it is,
man.

1664
01:25:03,041 --> 01:25:06,040
You've seen it and you know what it does
to you and if you're stupid you keep

1665
01:25:06,041 --> 01:25:09,610
looking, keep wanting to feel like
shit. I still have never seen two girls.

1666
01:25:09,611 --> 01:25:13,000
One Cup. I have no desire.
It's not bad. If you're,

1667
01:25:13,030 --> 01:25:15,550
if you're a person who's seen,

1668
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,460
you know the murder videos and
all this stuff that you've,

1669
01:25:18,461 --> 01:25:21,240
I'm sure you've seen two girls,
one companies,

1670
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:23,910
shit is that pain Olympics video reel,

1671
01:25:24,170 --> 01:25:26,590
so he would look at whether you're
doing this, what does it mean?

1672
01:25:26,650 --> 01:25:27,800
Where are you getting this answer for it?

1673
01:25:27,810 --> 01:25:30,910
It's like crowd source creator
of the Bma Payment Olympics.

1674
01:25:30,911 --> 01:25:35,450
I did an interview with him a long
time ago for a parody of the BME pain

1675
01:25:35,451 --> 01:25:40,450
Olympics. Yeah, that was the one we cut
up the video of the BME paint Olympics.

1676
01:25:40,451 --> 01:25:45,451
Final round was a parody of the BME
pain Olympics where people form and same

1677
01:25:46,121 --> 01:25:49,030
body modifications in
front of a live audience.

1678
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:51,700
This video though was a
video just making fun of it.

1679
01:25:51,701 --> 01:25:54,130
Like where the guy is actually a chopping
off his dick. It was actually right,

1680
01:25:54,131 --> 01:25:55,900
but no,
some of them are real dude.

1681
01:25:55,930 --> 01:25:59,500
I'm pretty sure on some of the different
things that were in that video that was

1682
01:25:59,740 --> 01:26:02,530
compiled.
We're actually actually really happened.

1683
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:05,720
Like people did actually cut themselves.
This isn't,

1684
01:26:05,721 --> 01:26:09,050
I mean there's not like a shortage of
those videos out there of guys doing it

1685
01:26:09,051 --> 01:26:10,760
and they just compiled a
bunch of them together.

1686
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:12,980
Yeah. Um, when we were
in like late twenties,

1687
01:26:12,981 --> 01:26:15,560
we'd look at that shit at epic all the
time and then like eventually we got an

1688
01:26:15,561 --> 01:26:18,200
HR department and we had to like shut.
They tell you to stop.

1689
01:26:18,650 --> 01:26:20,580
Yeah. Did they really? How dare they,

1690
01:26:20,670 --> 01:26:23,730
you created such amazing pieces of
work while you were doing all that.

1691
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:24,960
They think they know better.

1692
01:26:24,961 --> 01:26:27,570
They can tell you what the fucking thing
doesn't matter. His legal issues, dude,

1693
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,400
you know the legal issues.
Here's what's legal.

1694
01:26:29,550 --> 01:26:32,430
It should be legal to watch that stuff
and it should be legal to fire anybody

1695
01:26:32,431 --> 01:26:34,200
who complains.
That's what I say.

1696
01:26:34,201 --> 01:26:35,880
If you're working in an
office and someone's like,

1697
01:26:35,881 --> 01:26:38,760
you have quite a few bees
over there, watch and goes
get their heads chopped off.

1698
01:26:38,910 --> 01:26:42,570
Oh, I don't want to see it. Like
then you don't fit in. Yeah, get out.

1699
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:47,160
Well company culture starts from the
top of the food, the very top. Yeah.

1700
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:50,370
But when you have to create as a
very specific work environment,

1701
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:53,550
God that's gotta suck.
Like if you work like you sell insurance,

1702
01:26:53,730 --> 01:26:58,230
you have to have like very specific
code of conduct and ethics. No Fun.

1703
01:26:58,620 --> 01:27:01,320
The thing I, the thing, I don't
like his fucking politics now.

1704
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:04,350
Like the the ladder climbing off bullshit.
Disgusting.

1705
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,200
And it also like you're
seeing like, like those, um,

1706
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:10,550
when people get together at like have
like a corporate retreat here and they all

1707
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:13,140
sit around the dinner table and like we
were next to him the other night at a

1708
01:27:13,141 --> 01:27:15,900
restaurant and one guy was talking
and toasting and everybody was like,

1709
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:19,430
oh Christ him again.
And they just this weird culture,

1710
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:22,410
you know what valve valve a,
the video games.

1711
01:27:22,510 --> 01:27:22,901
Yeah.

1712
01:27:22,901 --> 01:27:27,130
They fly their entire company and the
entire company's families to Hawaii for

1713
01:27:27,131 --> 01:27:31,210
like two weeks every year. Wow. That's
bad ass. I'm like, fuck. Really?

1714
01:27:31,211 --> 01:27:32,160
Like out like you know.

1715
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:34,810
As much as I would like to think
I got along with my coworkers,

1716
01:27:34,811 --> 01:27:36,550
you know when I go on vacation to Hawaii,

1717
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:38,480
they're kind of the last
people I want to see my movie.

1718
01:27:38,481 --> 01:27:42,610
They're all just banging each other and
Hawaiians to drink an APP. Swingers,

1719
01:27:42,611 --> 01:27:43,810
swingers,
subcultures.

1720
01:27:43,811 --> 01:27:46,930
Fucking the shit out of each other
all over the beach and who gives it?

1721
01:27:46,940 --> 01:27:50,870
They used to do that for too.
Do you want to fuck the fuck my wife,

1722
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:53,530
I have two weeks out of the year.
Everything's cool. It's like that movie,

1723
01:27:53,531 --> 01:27:58,000
the purge. It was the worst
fucking [inaudible] of the year.

1724
01:27:58,180 --> 01:28:01,150
They all go to the big guy,
let it just fuck on lava rocks.

1725
01:28:01,151 --> 01:28:05,230
Just like wild animals shredding their
ass to whatever they can until they can't

1726
01:28:05,231 --> 01:28:05,770
do it anymore.

1727
01:28:05,770 --> 01:28:08,620
And then they go to the fucking
hospital and covered in black sand.

1728
01:28:08,621 --> 01:28:10,870
They come back home
and they blog about it.

1729
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:14,080
Jesus started talking shit about each
other. Valve doesn't give a fuck.

1730
01:28:14,081 --> 01:28:16,930
They can do whatever the hell they want
now. They made a lot of money, right?

1731
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,220
Well what they did was they made steam,

1732
01:28:18,221 --> 01:28:21,460
which is essentially a publisher and
like they just raking in money from that

1733
01:28:21,461 --> 01:28:22,930
and they can do whatever
they want game wise.

1734
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:26,350
There's just some next level
shit up there, man. What
have they created? A mood.

1735
01:28:26,351 --> 01:28:29,650
Video Games have Valve Korea.
They did a Dota too. Um,

1736
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:32,080
which is one of those mobile type
games like League of legends.

1737
01:28:32,081 --> 01:28:36,580
Halflife of core stand for multiple
Liam multiplayer online battle arena.

1738
01:28:36,630 --> 01:28:37,770
How's that kind of strategy?

1739
01:28:37,790 --> 01:28:42,760
I would know that dare you lose in
the New York crane. Firefly. Now this,

1740
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:46,540
how dare you? There's a lot of
people out there. Cliffy big dude.

1741
01:28:46,541 --> 01:28:50,320
I could never live in fucking
Seattle. No, it's just the gray man.

1742
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:53,470
You can never live in Seattle.
Brian. I put a good enough up there.

1743
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:56,320
It is beautiful. I love
it up there. Yeah. We, we,

1744
01:28:56,321 --> 01:28:58,870
we jokingly look at like the whole
weather app on my wife's phone. It's like,

1745
01:28:58,871 --> 01:29:02,760
you know, San Diego, Sunny Raleigh,
pretty good. Seattle, Gregg, Gregg, Gregg.

1746
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:03,361
Beautiful though.

1747
01:29:03,361 --> 01:29:05,970
It's so God damn green cause it's
so easy to grow shit up there.

1748
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:08,160
God damn the forests are immense.

1749
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:10,890
That's so incredible when
you driving around up there.

1750
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:14,360
If he makes gray with green, you're still
gonna get shit. I think people that,

1751
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:17,900
I think people that go up there though,
Brian,

1752
01:29:17,901 --> 01:29:20,580
I think what they do is they just
take vacations every year. Yeah.

1753
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:23,930
They go somewhere like really funny.
Nice and sunny like Hawaii.

1754
01:29:24,010 --> 01:29:25,150
When you live in Ohio though,

1755
01:29:25,390 --> 01:29:28,040
it's pretty known that it's the
one in the gray skies I think.

1756
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:31,550
And then like percentage
wise and it's Ohio. Yeah.

1757
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,400
And because it's just always cloudy,

1758
01:29:33,401 --> 01:29:36,700
always rainy and I think it's maybe the
number one. I hate to getting dark early.

1759
01:29:36,701 --> 01:29:37,740
Shit.
That's the worst.

1760
01:29:38,090 --> 01:29:39,740
Yeah.
That doesn't bother me that much.

1761
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:43,730
I think it's important to have a mixture
and I agree with you that I would way

1762
01:29:43,731 --> 01:29:47,030
rather have California's weather where
it's always sunny and pretty nice all the

1763
01:29:47,031 --> 01:29:50,990
time. Then going back to Boston and
deal with those fucking gray winters.

1764
01:29:50,991 --> 01:29:52,490
Cause those winters were horrible.

1765
01:29:52,650 --> 01:29:56,030
Dude. What's up? Pressing? That was up
there visiting a a while back and I was a,

1766
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:59,220
what's wasn't Quincy. We went to some
other town, I can remember to visit.

1767
01:29:59,221 --> 01:29:59,821
My buddy drew,

1768
01:29:59,821 --> 01:30:03,690
who's a writer on bioshock and we're at
an Irish pub and having a pint in some

1769
01:30:03,691 --> 01:30:04,950
random girls talking to him and she was,

1770
01:30:04,951 --> 01:30:07,560
and it was a really cute street
right there. And she's like, ah,

1771
01:30:07,561 --> 01:30:10,200
why do you think of a town? And I'm
like, that's lovely. And she's like,

1772
01:30:10,201 --> 01:30:13,490
why do you have Quia? I'm
like, as I said, the town

1773
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:15,380
shit is fucked her just to prove a point.

1774
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:18,250
Then she's thinking even want
to query on show you Joe clear

1775
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:23,940
married dude. Well you should use
a rubber dick. Then other respect.

1776
01:30:24,130 --> 01:30:27,500
Then she carry rubber deck just to
just to put women in their place. Yeah.

1777
01:30:27,501 --> 01:30:29,660
There you go. Days of
clouds. Seattle, Washington,

1778
01:30:29,661 --> 01:30:34,340
226 days of heavy clouds per
year. Wow. That's 62% of the time.

1779
01:30:34,550 --> 01:30:38,420
Portland, Oregon, slightly last Buffalo,
New York. Slightly less. It's birds.

1780
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:42,260
Wow. Yeah, a lot of
Ohio's. Yeah, it's rough.

1781
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:45,440
But you know what I was going to say is
that I do think that California has the

1782
01:30:45,441 --> 01:30:50,270
better set of weather, but I think there's
some benefit to experiencing whether,

1783
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:53,210
I think there's a benefit to being
in the rain. I think it's nice,

1784
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:56,170
it makes the environment better,
it's healthier, cleans out the,

1785
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:58,090
I like having seasons in North Carolina,

1786
01:30:58,710 --> 01:31:01,960
if you have seasons of the year is
fucking fly right by seasons are nice.

1787
01:31:01,961 --> 01:31:03,820
It makes you appreciate the warm
weather. And then, you know,

1788
01:31:03,821 --> 01:31:06,940
in the middle of January we'll go to
like the Caribbean for a week or two and

1789
01:31:06,941 --> 01:31:09,250
just fucking in getting them,
I'm a beach guy, dude. However,

1790
01:31:09,251 --> 01:31:12,670
I was in Edmonton like couple of weeks
ago and it was fucking zero. Yeah.

1791
01:31:12,970 --> 01:31:14,590
And I came back to La and it was eight.

1792
01:31:14,620 --> 01:31:18,130
I got a buddy of Louise's working at
WB Games in Montreal. He, I did the,

1793
01:31:18,190 --> 01:31:20,020
the new Batman game and he would tell me,
he's like,

1794
01:31:20,050 --> 01:31:22,180
get off his bus or get out
of the subway or whatever,

1795
01:31:22,181 --> 01:31:25,210
go into work and like the 10 minute walk
to the actually get to the officer's

1796
01:31:25,211 --> 01:31:29,110
beer would freeze. Yeah, that's totally
hear such good things about Montreal.

1797
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:31,810
But like if I go up there to visit,
it's gonna be in the summer cause I just,

1798
01:31:31,811 --> 01:31:33,430
I'm done with winter.
Right. It's just rough ice.

1799
01:31:33,450 --> 01:31:36,760
Two gigs in Montreal in the winter.
They should do while the comedy works.

1800
01:31:36,770 --> 01:31:41,640
Montreal when I was living in New York
would fly up there and it was, you know,

1801
01:31:41,740 --> 01:31:46,510
minus 10 minus 15 did you ever have to
adjust your ax depending on where you are?

1802
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:50,830
Do you like depending on like, you know,
in French Canadian crowd for example,

1803
01:31:50,831 --> 01:31:55,570
I should have and that's why I failed
many times in those environments. Yeah,

1804
01:31:55,680 --> 01:32:00,100
no. Yeah, it depends. You know,
there's two of thought. One School

1805
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:02,920
of thought is do something
that everybody's going to like.

1806
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:05,890
That's the Jay Leno School of thought.
Like, Hey, you know my contract,

1807
01:32:05,950 --> 01:32:08,490
I could do my act anyway. Yeah, I can
do it in the little kids. Then man,

1808
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:09,390
I have to take Samson.

1809
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:12,790
Jada guys didn't want to do the act
that Jaylen Leno actually said to me.

1810
01:32:12,850 --> 01:32:14,950
I asked him once about Bill
Hicks Cause Bill Hicks road.

1811
01:32:14,951 --> 01:32:18,450
So I'm like really mean shit about him
and he's like, ah, I don't know. You know,

1812
01:32:18,460 --> 01:32:21,430
a bill didn't want to do what
everybody wanted to hear.

1813
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:22,660
They wanted to do what he wanted to do.

1814
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:26,860
And I think there's only one way to
really get your audience and you have to

1815
01:32:26,861 --> 01:32:29,080
like continue to do what you want to do.

1816
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:32,500
And there's going to be nights where
the people don't want to hear that shit.

1817
01:32:32,530 --> 01:32:34,030
It's going to be if they
don't know who you are,

1818
01:32:34,031 --> 01:32:37,930
especially if you have a dirty act. It's
tricky situations. It's tricky to do.

1819
01:32:38,170 --> 01:32:42,850
So a lot of guys would ride
a lot of material that maybe
necessarily it was more

1820
01:32:42,851 --> 01:32:46,830
utilitarian, it served a purpose
then it would be like their,

1821
01:32:46,831 --> 01:32:50,560
their actual expressions throw that in
there if it felt like it was going on.

1822
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:54,350
I love video games, I love movies, but
I so fucking love comedy. It's fun.

1823
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:59,360
Like I saw, um, Colin Cane Gilson him at
all. No, I don't know Ellie based guy.

1824
01:32:59,361 --> 01:33:02,720
He said he's up and coming and he
sees like just imagine Dane Cook.

1825
01:33:02,721 --> 01:33:05,770
If he was completely just filthy and
massage, you just hurt my feelings.

1826
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:08,480
I'm going to pee. And why don't you?
No, I'm just kidding. I like Jane.

1827
01:33:08,870 --> 01:33:12,330
I'm friends with Tina. I started out
with doing really, but I do have to pay.

1828
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:13,100
We talked to him.
Yeah.

1829
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:17,280
Here's something interesting is that the
tie the top 10 unhappiest cities, uh,

1830
01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:21,010
which is crazy cause it's almost the
exact same list that we saw that cloudy.

1831
01:33:21,020 --> 01:33:25,910
Like the first one is Portland,
Oregon. Second one is St Louis,

1832
01:33:25,940 --> 01:33:30,860
third New Orleans, New
Orleans, Detroit, Cleveland,

1833
01:33:31,250 --> 01:33:34,520
Jacksonville, Florida,
Vegas, Nashville. Again,

1834
01:33:34,550 --> 01:33:38,600
Cincinnati to Ohio's Atlanta. It looked
Raleigh's not anywhere on there. Yeah.

1835
01:33:39,050 --> 01:33:40,820
It keeps being voted. One
of the top 10 cities, man.

1836
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:44,510
I was thinking if I could go anywhere
I'd probably go Texas for the same reason

1837
01:33:44,511 --> 01:33:48,280
why it's not as expensive as Austin,
La Austin. Austin is one of my,

1838
01:33:48,390 --> 01:33:50,000
my on my shortlist of other places.
I'd love to live.

1839
01:33:50,010 --> 01:33:52,870
Elijah Woods said Fuck La and decided to
just move to Austin city. Really? Yeah.

1840
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:55,670
I was up there for south by
southwest dude. That's my,
one of my favorite cities.

1841
01:33:56,060 --> 01:33:58,760
And that's why I call Raleigh Mini Austin
cause it's like this little kind of

1842
01:33:58,761 --> 01:34:02,690
like mini sea of cool in the
middle of this GOP rolled state.

1843
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:05,720
And uh, you know, I'm fucking
doubling down there. You know,

1844
01:34:05,721 --> 01:34:07,790
it's like the coasts are great.
You know,

1845
01:34:07,791 --> 01:34:11,630
it's like if we go two hours away to the
beach man and like you could just like

1846
01:34:11,631 --> 01:34:13,790
the beach real estate in
Carolina beach is like,

1847
01:34:13,791 --> 01:34:17,630
you get a condo in the water for 300
grand. Like it's, and then cause you,

1848
01:34:17,631 --> 01:34:21,020
cause you got to Wilmington Wrightsville
which is a little bit old money. Right.

1849
01:34:21,021 --> 01:34:23,540
And like the same condo would be like 1
million bucks, but it's like, you know,

1850
01:34:23,541 --> 01:34:26,780
you and you, did we go to the yacht
club today or that kind of vibe? Right.

1851
01:34:27,020 --> 01:34:30,020
I'd rather be hanging out with all the
fucking rednecks is they're awesome.

1852
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:31,910
Why was just say rednecks are awesome.

1853
01:34:32,050 --> 01:34:34,640
Well I come back in and cliff has
been a totally different person.

1854
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:36,480
It's a strange why.

1855
01:34:36,481 --> 01:34:39,880
Why was gears of war number two and
number three never reported by the, uh,

1856
01:34:40,010 --> 01:34:44,950
to the pcs but yet gears of
war one and was, you know,
a myriad of reasons. It's a,

1857
01:34:45,050 --> 01:34:48,110
the only way to really succeed in that
space at the time was to put something on

1858
01:34:48,111 --> 01:34:51,170
steam and, uh, it was just
man hours at the time.

1859
01:34:51,470 --> 01:34:54,860
So it wasn't an easy conversion from
the ECZEMA. The controls also were,

1860
01:34:54,861 --> 01:34:56,360
it didn't translate that well,
you know,

1861
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,070
with the whole cover and
everything like that.

1862
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:01,910
Has anybody ever figured out how to do
a keyboard and mouse for console? Uh,

1863
01:35:01,911 --> 01:35:04,040
know what they do is they just
make it the twin stick thing.

1864
01:35:04,041 --> 01:35:05,210
And what they do is they,
they,

1865
01:35:05,270 --> 01:35:07,490
they assist your aim without
you really realizing it.

1866
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:10,060
And so it's called friction adhesion.

1867
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:12,470
So if I'm moving across her over
you and halo, if you ever play it,

1868
01:35:12,530 --> 01:35:15,650
it's slightly slows your
cross here a little bit so
it helps you and you're like,

1869
01:35:15,651 --> 01:35:17,780
damn, I'm good. Cause
it's actually pretty dope.

1870
01:35:17,781 --> 01:35:21,150
If that was like real technology
and actual war, you know,

1871
01:35:21,151 --> 01:35:23,000
fight the cursory like found people,

1872
01:35:23,190 --> 01:35:26,320
oh that bullet bullets that go around
corners and everything if the the future

1873
01:35:26,490 --> 01:35:29,390
and you know at least he saw that
Darpa robot that carries or was Boston

1874
01:35:29,391 --> 01:35:33,320
dynamics that can carry like 300 pounds
for him. Right. Exosuits and yeah.

1875
01:35:33,321 --> 01:35:35,690
How about those fucking
robot dogs that you can kick?

1876
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:39,350
Yeah and it won't fall down. They have
a button motorcycle like that too. Yeah,

1877
01:35:39,351 --> 01:35:42,080
I've seen that. Fucking impressive.
We've got some wild shit coming out.

1878
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:45,390
My biggest problem right now is
just data everywhere. Like a medic.

1879
01:35:45,410 --> 01:35:47,810
We're all addicted. Did the feed.
We're addicted to data, news,

1880
01:35:47,811 --> 01:35:49,370
news stories like everything breaks.

1881
01:35:49,371 --> 01:35:52,730
Things go viral and be like that whole
instance that the executive producer for

1882
01:35:52,731 --> 01:35:55,970
like the bachelor who was on the plane
around Thanksgiving with the lady who was

1883
01:35:55,971 --> 01:35:58,640
claiming that she was being a bitch and
he sent her some drinks and told her to

1884
01:35:58,641 --> 01:36:00,920
eat his dick and it turns out
with the whole thing is fake.

1885
01:36:00,950 --> 01:36:05,470
He just made it all up and
it was too late. It had gone
viral. There it is. Look,

1886
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:10,110
yeah, that's incredible. It's crazy. Looks
like a bunch of broken legs and Bambi.

1887
01:36:10,130 --> 01:36:11,930
That's like some metal gear,
solid shit right there.

1888
01:36:12,070 --> 01:36:16,250
That looks like two men like facing each
other to packages like the fake donkey.

1889
01:36:17,180 --> 01:36:18,720
So weird like uh,

1890
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:22,430
like a couple of drunk college kids
trying to move their futon or something.

1891
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:24,200
When those things are acting on their own,

1892
01:36:24,201 --> 01:36:26,030
that's when we know that's
going to be a weird thing.

1893
01:36:26,031 --> 01:36:28,970
When you see those coming over the
mountains of Pakistan with fucking machine

1894
01:36:28,971 --> 01:36:33,170
guns on top of them or Amazon in the
drones. We never really talked about that.

1895
01:36:33,171 --> 01:36:35,920
The Amazon, that was more PR
thing for them though. Yeah,

1896
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:38,270
because the amount of hurdles they'd
have to get through for that to happen.

1897
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:39,740
Why don't you explain
what you're talking about?

1898
01:36:40,190 --> 01:36:44,120
Amazon was talking about using
actual drones to deliver packages,

1899
01:36:44,121 --> 01:36:47,060
which is one of the most ridiculous
things I've ever heard in my life.

1900
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:51,950
That would mean you would have to like a
drone would fly a package to your house

1901
01:36:51,951 --> 01:36:53,150
and drop off in front of House.

1902
01:36:53,151 --> 01:36:56,330
And a lot of people thought that maybe
that can happen in a hundred years from

1903
01:36:56,331 --> 01:36:57,380
now or 20 years from now.

1904
01:36:57,381 --> 01:37:00,560
But Amazon's kind of front and talking
about how they're going to deliver dude

1905
01:37:00,561 --> 01:37:01,020
with that.

1906
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:03,740
Only a person who has a gun is not going
to try and shoot those fucking things

1907
01:37:03,741 --> 01:37:07,400
down 30 to insure them. Right. All right.

1908
01:37:07,540 --> 01:37:11,210
Well I'll get mad too. Flies
over their property. Yup.

1909
01:37:11,330 --> 01:37:13,790
Also just think about if
this did start catching on,

1910
01:37:13,791 --> 01:37:15,530
we would have to say goodbye to sunsets.

1911
01:37:15,531 --> 01:37:17,660
We would not see the
clouds or the sky anymore.

1912
01:37:17,661 --> 01:37:20,990
We just have thousands of these little
fucking robots flying around to dropping

1913
01:37:20,991 --> 01:37:25,610
off tampons. But at the same time, dude,
I haven't gotten into a target in a year.

1914
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:29,360
Right. True. It every, everything
online. But yeah, here's the, uh,

1915
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:34,250
the packages come to this thing I guess.
And then that gets picked up by a drone.

1916
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:39,170
Uh, so supposedly this is real because
it seemed like a practical joke for the

1917
01:37:39,171 --> 01:37:42,590
longest time, unless they're just
planning an April fool's now.

1918
01:37:42,620 --> 01:37:46,790
Maybe if it's not important shit,
you could just fly it around like that.

1919
01:37:46,791 --> 01:37:48,260
But it seems like,
man,

1920
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:53,360
that's not really what shirt I and want
to get my new espresso maker. Yeah.

1921
01:37:53,420 --> 01:37:56,120
30 minute delivery though is what you,
they're trying to would

1922
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:58,950
be even in Raleigh with Amazon prime.
We ordered some shit in the afternoon.

1923
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:02,700
The next day, boom. Done.
So this is real. Wow.

1924
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:06,140
This is fucking strange dude.

1925
01:38:06,310 --> 01:38:09,570
I think it's them projecting like remember
that old video, um, where it's like,

1926
01:38:09,571 --> 01:38:10,650
have you ever,
you know,

1927
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:13,620
second night to your kid or on
a video phone you will write.

1928
01:38:13,621 --> 01:38:15,210
That becoming became strangely true.

1929
01:38:15,211 --> 01:38:17,820
I think they're kind of projecting
a little bit further forward.

1930
01:38:18,090 --> 01:38:22,860
People are going to shoot those fucking
things. Even like kids with BB guns, dude.

1931
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:26,400
Yeah. I just want Amazon
platinum where if I'm home,

1932
01:38:26,430 --> 01:38:29,160
the take the shit out of the box and
then they take the box and the wrapping

1933
01:38:29,161 --> 01:38:31,650
away. Well you could actually
just shoot the package.

1934
01:38:31,651 --> 01:38:33,690
What you could do is
like as the guys flying,

1935
01:38:33,691 --> 01:38:35,820
if you had a high powered rifle
and you're looking out the window,

1936
01:38:35,821 --> 01:38:38,820
you can just take the package
out from the sky. Yeah. Boom.

1937
01:38:38,821 --> 01:38:41,280
And he delivers a package with
a big bullet hole in it. Yeah.

1938
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:44,280
People are gonna get mad too if you're
flying over their fucking house. Yeah.

1939
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:46,560
Eh.

1940
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:49,480
Well they, they're probably planning
on urban areas originally, right.

1941
01:38:49,481 --> 01:38:53,680
Where it's already normal black people
urban.

1942
01:38:54,460 --> 01:38:57,280
How did urban become black people done?
What the fuck happened there?

1943
01:38:57,310 --> 01:38:58,720
That's weird, right? It's very weird.

1944
01:38:58,721 --> 01:39:01,360
Like the only like black people I live
in cities or something like a euphemism

1945
01:39:01,390 --> 01:39:04,180
for even just want to say is it's
an urban crowd. They want to,

1946
01:39:04,210 --> 01:39:06,160
they want to say black people if
they don't want to get in trouble.

1947
01:39:06,490 --> 01:39:07,870
So they say it's an urban crowd,

1948
01:39:08,170 --> 01:39:12,500
but yet you go to urban outfitters and
stuff is whitest place you've ever been.

1949
01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:15,910
Urban outfitters is the opposite of urban.
Right.

1950
01:39:16,390 --> 01:39:21,040
That's the dumbest name for that place
ever. It's a hot topic. It's a hot topic.

1951
01:39:21,041 --> 01:39:24,130
Suburban outfitters. Yup. Yeah.
How was that urban outfit?

1952
01:39:24,190 --> 01:39:28,930
And we have to make a fucking agreement.
I don't know what urban actually means.

1953
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:31,600
I mean I was scared to go in the store
for the first five years. It was open.

1954
01:39:31,630 --> 01:39:35,860
That's racist. You thought you were
going to get ganged? Yeah. For you.

1955
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:39,130
Horny free chains. Dude,
I fucking hate the mall.

1956
01:39:39,820 --> 01:39:42,540
I don't know if I'm just a grumpy old
man. I just can't stand going there. Yeah,

1957
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:46,450
it's a good place to find stores.
What do you hate about the mall?

1958
01:39:46,810 --> 01:39:49,710
It's not forced to you and goes. Yeah,
yeah, it's definitely inefficient.

1959
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:52,300
So don't go. I'm all about
efficiency. Yeah, but it's cool.

1960
01:39:52,301 --> 01:39:55,190
You could try clothes on, you
know, buy things, clothes,

1961
01:39:55,410 --> 01:39:58,330
clothes and food are the two things you
buy in person. Right. Everything else.

1962
01:39:58,331 --> 01:40:00,490
One click that in your phone.
So we got off track,

1963
01:40:00,491 --> 01:40:02,380
but I wanted to ask you like
if you were going to buy,

1964
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:06,340
you said you would build your own laptop
PC, but like when you buy one now,

1965
01:40:06,341 --> 01:40:10,240
like what company do you [inaudible]
we got the razor blade for the laptop.

1966
01:40:10,540 --> 01:40:13,420
What does that mean? It's just, it's
a razor used to make like the Oh,

1967
01:40:13,421 --> 01:40:15,810
the Razer mice. Yeah,
same company. The laptop.

1968
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:18,700
And then they just crushed it with
this one. It's a fantastic laptop.

1969
01:40:18,730 --> 01:40:22,830
I met that dude, the guy who
calls himself, raise your
guy. Me and Lou Morton who,

1970
01:40:22,831 --> 01:40:26,110
who's one of the writers on news radio
and a couple other guys went to, uh,

1971
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:30,370
he had a bunch of prototype mice. That
was back when they had that weird mouse.

1972
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:31,900
Remember how they had one leg?
Yeah.

1973
01:40:31,901 --> 01:40:33,950
You remember that thing
or that is super accurate.

1974
01:40:34,020 --> 01:40:38,900
They had like a 2000 DPI sensor
long before anybody else did they,

1975
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:42,820
I mean it was a really sensitive mountain.
Super, super play to the core. Yeah.

1976
01:40:43,210 --> 01:40:45,280
But it was also,
it would like,

1977
01:40:45,430 --> 01:40:47,980
it was kinda getting old
school because it was a ball.

1978
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:49,260
It was still a right and you'll get,

1979
01:40:49,261 --> 01:40:53,270
wasn't laser y'all me shit up and
get all the dog hair and boogers.

1980
01:40:53,330 --> 01:40:54,040
And the problem was

1981
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:57,350
they were trying to pretend that
that shape wasn't retarded. Yeah.

1982
01:40:57,420 --> 01:41:00,970
I remember they had that ridiculous,
totally unergonomic shape.

1983
01:41:00,971 --> 01:41:04,240
It was like a duck's foot. Yeah.
Yeah. It was flat. It was weird.

1984
01:41:04,330 --> 01:41:06,970
I used it though cause it was so
god damn accurate put up with it.

1985
01:41:07,090 --> 01:41:11,830
But I went back to, uh, do you
remember the, um, that a gaming mouse,

1986
01:41:11,831 --> 01:41:15,170
that logic tech gaming mouse. That was
the shit. Is that the white one? No, the,

1987
01:41:15,171 --> 01:41:17,680
the um, logic has, it was a gray one.

1988
01:41:17,950 --> 01:41:21,790
It was like a mouse that was invented
just for gaming and it had like this real

1989
01:41:21,791 --> 01:41:25,630
small, almost like deer hook size, like,

1990
01:41:25,690 --> 01:41:29,710
or cow hooves. So sort of this is the
optic was an optical or, no, it wasn't.

1991
01:41:29,711 --> 01:41:34,210
Not initially, but it was so good. It
wasn't as fast as far as like picking up,

1992
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:37,630
but it felt so good in your hand that it
made up for the fact that it wasn't as

1993
01:41:37,631 --> 01:41:38,040
fast.

1994
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:40,470
John Ramiro just went to
like a 20th anniversary.

1995
01:41:40,471 --> 01:41:44,550
I think it was at least 20 or 25 for
a dune did. He's doing well, man.

1996
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:45,990
That was the guy.
He was one of the,

1997
01:41:45,991 --> 01:41:50,430
it was him and Carmeg and he was like the
guy who went on to do that crazy game.

1998
01:41:50,490 --> 01:41:53,120
Um,
what was the fucking game it took back?

1999
01:41:53,310 --> 01:41:56,540
What the Fuck Ramiro Ramiro to doom quake.
Right.

2000
01:41:56,590 --> 01:42:00,780
But after he left like a ton,
I was fucking fun man.

2001
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:02,880
The game did not get enough respect.

2002
01:42:02,910 --> 01:42:06,180
He was one of the first people to be
progressively bullied by the forming

2003
01:42:06,181 --> 01:42:10,440
internet. Oh. Like the other one wanted
to hate him is too sexy. Beautiful.

2004
01:42:10,540 --> 01:42:15,130
Drove around in Ferrari's
and shit. [inaudible] pull
up video of Dika Tauna dude,

2005
01:42:15,131 --> 01:42:19,050
what does dyke aton I had like
some really fun multiplayer,

2006
01:42:19,051 --> 01:42:22,860
like the one on one and [inaudible]
was really fun. The rocket,

2007
01:42:22,861 --> 01:42:24,940
it was a little bit imbalanced.
Little rocket launcher.

2008
01:42:25,350 --> 01:42:28,800
I'll go to Dallas and I stayed in my
hotel downtown and I look at that building

2009
01:42:28,801 --> 01:42:32,070
and it just, I see it as a cautionary
tale for if I started a studio.

2010
01:42:32,071 --> 01:42:34,010
Like be careful, you know, like,

2011
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:36,160
well you gotta explain to people that
don't know what the fuck we're doing.

2012
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:39,990
Sorry. Sorry. So John Romero was one of
the key creatives behind doom and quake,

2013
01:42:39,991 --> 01:42:42,210
which are basically invented
the first person shooters genre.

2014
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:44,970
John Carmack went to Oculus, by
the way. That's another side note.

2015
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:47,980
I knew about that months in advance.
They had to keep my mouth shut anyway,

2016
01:42:48,110 --> 01:42:52,530
dropping information. He was like video
games, first fucking rock star, right?

2017
01:42:52,531 --> 01:42:55,080
He's the guy I wanted to be
growing up. Right. And uh,

2018
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:58,530
then he started his own company with
idas money that was made from tomb raider

2019
01:42:58,740 --> 01:43:00,450
and he started in the heart of Dallas,
got the biggest,

2020
01:43:00,451 --> 01:43:03,600
most expensive penthouse suite
he could find insane real estate.

2021
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:07,740
And he did the whole Gary Oldman get me
every one like hired way too many people,

2022
01:43:07,741 --> 01:43:11,520
wait too many fast and basically overshot
and his first game then it became so

2023
01:43:11,521 --> 01:43:14,760
much money though PR disaster for
him. Um, but deus ex came out of that,

2024
01:43:14,761 --> 01:43:16,320
which is a fantastic series a,

2025
01:43:16,330 --> 01:43:18,450
an Akron oxys just underrated
little role playing game.

2026
01:43:18,451 --> 01:43:21,570
I know so many people who work there and
we're there firsthand and a lot of them

2027
01:43:21,571 --> 01:43:25,260
still work at epic. What was the name of
the company again? Ion Storm Ion storm.

2028
01:43:25,261 --> 01:43:28,450
And they became infamous because
an ad agency had made an ad, uh,

2029
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:31,680
that said John Ramirez in. But to make
you his bitch. What is this bro? Yeah,

2030
01:43:31,690 --> 01:43:35,850
I remember it down. What does this
bride dyke, Katana, this is, it will,

2031
01:43:35,930 --> 01:43:39,210
you'll be surprised how many old games
the graphics don't hold up man. Oh yeah,

2032
01:43:39,211 --> 01:43:42,420
but your memory of them, right?
Yeah. I can't hardly remember,

2033
01:43:42,421 --> 01:43:45,330
but I want him to see the multiplayer.
If you could find it. It was really good.

2034
01:43:45,331 --> 01:43:50,250
Multiplayer was fun. It was like
old school. Um, quake one. Yeah.

2035
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:52,220
Remember how quake one was like really

2036
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:53,690
fast and you would,
you know,

2037
01:43:53,691 --> 01:43:56,210
when you were running you were
really running fast then quick to,

2038
01:43:56,211 --> 01:43:58,670
they slowed it way down.
I'm just, you know,

2039
01:43:58,671 --> 01:44:03,290
there may be a market for a new one of
those soon, if you know what I'm saying.

2040
01:44:03,530 --> 01:44:08,330
He's winking at me folks and he's
clearly heterosexual. He, he can't say,

2041
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:11,850
but he's working right now on something
just like that. I think. Sure.

2042
01:44:11,870 --> 01:44:15,050
You're going to tell me any more. It's
a fucking materials, dude. I don't care.

2043
01:44:15,830 --> 01:44:17,000
Okay.
That's why I'm getting it.

2044
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:21,020
But it's how do you think you know people
that these kids who play call of duty

2045
01:44:21,021 --> 01:44:24,260
know what the proper like
there's dot Qatada PC shooter is,

2046
01:44:24,530 --> 01:44:28,220
I think a lot of kids don't
these at these events.

2047
01:44:28,221 --> 01:44:31,370
They're still playing counter strike and
team fortress two look how bad ass this

2048
01:44:31,371 --> 01:44:34,640
is. This is fucking, he had like
a pretty good but a four barrel,

2049
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:39,260
like an 18 barrel shotgun called the shuts
cycler. Yeah, that was cool. You had,

2050
01:44:39,390 --> 01:44:40,640
you started out with like a thing,

2051
01:44:40,641 --> 01:44:43,970
you have your punch people and then you
had to run around and I enjoyed those

2052
01:44:43,971 --> 01:44:46,340
games too.
We had to like collect the items,

2053
01:44:46,630 --> 01:44:50,450
the time when the rocket launcher
would reappear. That's the,

2054
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:52,400
and they'll look at the f like
just flowing through the level.

2055
01:44:52,401 --> 01:44:55,660
Right and anticipating the sound cues
and knowing where they're coming from and

2056
01:44:56,180 --> 01:44:57,950
the one on one battles and everything.
Yeah.

2057
01:44:57,951 --> 01:44:59,450
Well people who've never
played these things,

2058
01:44:59,451 --> 01:45:03,560
they really are never going to understand
how much like thinking is going on

2059
01:45:03,561 --> 01:45:06,440
simultaneously and movement
of your hands and fingers.

2060
01:45:06,441 --> 01:45:08,360
Like it's incredibly intoxicating.
It is.

2061
01:45:08,540 --> 01:45:11,060
It's not like people think of it
as like, Oh, you're playing games.

2062
01:45:11,061 --> 01:45:13,980
Like what are you doing? Pretending
some fucking shit's going on. We'll,

2063
01:45:13,981 --> 01:45:16,700
we'll go kill the werewolf. No, it's your,

2064
01:45:16,710 --> 01:45:21,410
you're online in real time with someone,
you know, that could be fucking anywhere.

2065
01:45:21,410 --> 01:45:26,030
And with the technology that we have
today and you're playing this incredibly

2066
01:45:26,031 --> 01:45:31,031
quick gain and get all your senses are
firing and everyone's on mountain dew to

2067
01:45:31,581 --> 01:45:33,470
that now. I bet they're
all on Adderall. Right?

2068
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:37,340
I bet these kids are Adderall at the
fuck up or I scoured energy drinks times

2069
01:45:37,341 --> 01:45:41,050
three. Did they say that? Like a
amphetamines and Fed Amines? Uh,

2070
01:45:41,090 --> 01:45:43,340
we're like one of the best things that,
uh,

2071
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:46,720
you could ever take if you were playing
a first person shooter. Really? Yeah.

2072
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:51,740
Because you can get locked into like a
really intense battle for a long time and

2073
01:45:51,741 --> 01:45:53,000
you wouldn't lose concentration.

2074
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:56,270
I'm like taking him Pheta means
to play fucking video games. Well,

2075
01:45:56,271 --> 01:45:58,310
so what would happen? Imagine
like with the, you know,

2076
01:45:58,311 --> 01:46:02,030
if some of these twitch first person
shooters become big in the east sports

2077
01:46:02,031 --> 01:46:05,870
scene is they'll have to start screening
for it. Just like blood doping probably.

2078
01:46:05,871 --> 01:46:09,080
Yeah. I would imagine you have
millions of dollars at stake, you know?

2079
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:12,170
And if that guy has that extra
edge yeah. You know, it's,

2080
01:46:12,171 --> 01:46:14,700
it's the whole La Lance
Armstrong thing, right? Yeah.

2081
01:46:14,701 --> 01:46:16,130
I would think that there's probably some,

2082
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:19,030
I mean maybe it makes shitty
judgements though. Yeah. You know,

2083
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:22,550
maybe that's too much. Maybe your,
your two fit, but I know muscle memory,

2084
01:46:22,551 --> 01:46:26,870
it's strategy, right? It's all there.
But it's not just that there's also like,

2085
01:46:26,871 --> 01:46:31,820
it takes away nerves in a weird way, you
know? And part of competition has nerves,

2086
01:46:32,030 --> 01:46:33,900
part of comedy.
That's like a big thing in the,

2087
01:46:33,901 --> 01:46:38,030
in the pool world and a professional
pool guys used to take amphetamines,

2088
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:41,900
he's take pills and they would be able
to play for 10 12 hours and they didn't

2089
01:46:41,901 --> 01:46:45,130
have nerves. Like their nerves would
go away because they were like,

2090
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:46,820
one of the things that
crystal meth people do,

2091
01:46:46,821 --> 01:46:50,220
they make terrible fucking decisions
because whacked out of their mind,

2092
01:46:50,221 --> 01:46:51,560
they don't even know that they're there.

2093
01:46:51,570 --> 01:46:54,630
Like they're barely aware of what the
fuck is happening in front of them.

2094
01:46:54,631 --> 01:46:57,000
They have a completely
distorted perception of reality.

2095
01:46:57,180 --> 01:47:01,830
Well along with that allegedly
and apparently comes like
an ease and competition

2096
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:04,740
because for things that
don't require cardiovascular,

2097
01:47:04,741 --> 01:47:08,220
like you would obviously had a heart
attack if you tried smoking meth and

2098
01:47:08,221 --> 01:47:09,090
playing basketball.

2099
01:47:09,690 --> 01:47:14,690
Apparently for some people smoking meth
or taking math and playing pool like

2100
01:47:15,631 --> 01:47:17,100
works really well. Let's let's, you know,

2101
01:47:17,101 --> 01:47:20,370
watching football and watching the kicker,
it's like, you know you have one job.

2102
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:24,480
No pressure. Right? Don't fuck it
up. That's a terrifying job though.

2103
01:47:24,481 --> 01:47:27,450
You got a bunch of fucking gigantic
super athletes running at you,

2104
01:47:27,451 --> 01:47:31,380
dude for four forties I grew up like in
New England as he know and sports were

2105
01:47:31,381 --> 01:47:34,290
forced on my fucking throat by my
brothers and I hated them and I was like,

2106
01:47:34,310 --> 01:47:37,730
Hi Shane. I'm going around. I'm like video
games and a only like a few years ago,

2107
01:47:37,731 --> 01:47:40,530
it's, it's just really started
enjoying the NFL. You allowed yourself.

2108
01:47:40,970 --> 01:47:44,400
I fucking love it. It's chest with 280
pound dudes. I would definitely like it.

2109
01:47:44,401 --> 01:47:48,180
I just can't watch. It's too much.
I have any time. Yeah, fair enough.

2110
01:47:48,210 --> 01:47:51,220
It's like I spent too much time obsessing
about a million other things if I

2111
01:47:51,221 --> 01:47:53,540
wanted to get involved in
football too. Yeah. Like I,

2112
01:47:53,541 --> 01:47:56,070
I've tuned into those like Fox
shows when they started having these

2113
01:47:56,071 --> 01:47:58,560
conversations. Well Denver's got
to get off the backend. What,

2114
01:47:58,561 --> 01:48:01,830
what's going on with it and bowls.
Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh doesn't fix this.

2115
01:48:02,370 --> 01:48:03,990
I gotta get out of the,
for me it's a whole,

2116
01:48:03,991 --> 01:48:06,780
it's a whole new game to learn that I've
ignored my whole life and I'm willing

2117
01:48:06,781 --> 01:48:09,570
to admit that I don't know a lot
about it and it's just, you know,

2118
01:48:09,571 --> 01:48:12,070
I'm rooting for the saints because my
wife's from New Orleans and they just did

2119
01:48:12,071 --> 01:48:13,110
it.
Team has a lot of heart.

2120
01:48:13,111 --> 01:48:16,860
Drew Brees is a fucking stud and it's
sick excuse to drink beer on a Sunday and

2121
01:48:16,861 --> 01:48:19,230
it's just fucking fun to watch,
man. It seems like it's fun.

2122
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:21,430
I mean it's kind of like a
gladiator type thing, you know,

2123
01:48:21,450 --> 01:48:23,940
you're watching like some sort
of an organized war. It's just,

2124
01:48:23,941 --> 01:48:24,900
they don't actually kill each other.

2125
01:48:25,140 --> 01:48:28,110
Just need steel balls to make it out
to another, a couple of UFC events.

2126
01:48:28,111 --> 01:48:31,230
That one that you and Charlotte, that
was fucking amazing. That was a good one.

2127
01:48:31,231 --> 01:48:32,670
That was a long time ago,
man.

2128
01:48:32,671 --> 01:48:35,220
That was a totally different
experience than the UFC today.

2129
01:48:35,430 --> 01:48:37,110
Somebody on Twitter was like,
oh, you're going to, you know,

2130
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:40,380
show Joe Your Med knowledge of MMA.
I'm like, I don't know shit. I'm like,

2131
01:48:40,381 --> 01:48:42,930
I'm not going to try and fake it.
Like I went there, I'd appreciated it.

2132
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:44,280
It was fucking fantastic.

2133
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:46,530
And I felt like a savage cause
like at the beginning I'm like, oh,

2134
01:48:46,531 --> 01:48:49,650
this is so violent. By the end I'm
like, fucking kill him. Get on.

2135
01:48:49,670 --> 01:48:53,050
How dare you cliffy being someone's
playing too many video games. Yeah.

2136
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:57,420
It shouldn't say kill him. That seems
rude. The, um, the, the level of athlete,

2137
01:48:57,430 --> 01:49:00,540
those very, very high. Now back then,

2138
01:49:00,541 --> 01:49:03,690
I mean we were talking about what is it
like 2005 or four or something like that.

2139
01:49:03,691 --> 01:49:06,720
It was in Charlotte. It was a long
time ago. I forget the exact year,

2140
01:49:06,721 --> 01:49:11,490
but the level of athlete has gone up
considerably since then. It's, it's right.

2141
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:15,540
Look at the old school videos of football
players and how big they were and how

2142
01:49:15,541 --> 01:49:17,100
fast they move versus these guys now,

2143
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:20,550
how much changes there have been though
in the last decade? I don't know.

2144
01:49:20,700 --> 01:49:23,400
Honestly it's a streaming.
Is his strength training gotten better?

2145
01:49:23,401 --> 01:49:25,190
I mean did the MMA is,
it was,

2146
01:49:25,191 --> 01:49:28,380
it's still a relatively new sport
compared to the other ones and you're just

2147
01:49:28,381 --> 01:49:29,340
starting to also,

2148
01:49:29,341 --> 01:49:33,780
you're just starting to get like the real
top end athletes to come over to MMA.

2149
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:37,010
Whereas before you were getting guys,
you know,

2150
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:40,950
who may be like wrestled in college but
they didn't have a professional outlet

2151
01:49:40,951 --> 01:49:44,490
and in the UFC came along and some of
them reluctantly went into the UFC.

2152
01:49:44,910 --> 01:49:48,040
Now you're getting these guys that
grew up wanting to be a UFC fighter.

2153
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:50,930
That's cool. And they saw it from the
beginning and never forget to what,

2154
01:49:50,980 --> 01:49:52,570
why I like hearing the crowd,

2155
01:49:52,571 --> 01:49:55,240
like get all crazy and cause somebody
was coming through and realizing it was

2156
01:49:55,241 --> 01:49:56,860
Dana White and like how they just,

2157
01:49:56,890 --> 01:49:59,590
they just worshiped him and how fucking
cool that was and how he turned that

2158
01:49:59,591 --> 01:50:00,490
thing around and it's cool.

2159
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:02,820
Yeah.
Well there's a lot of factors involved,

2160
01:50:02,821 --> 01:50:05,100
but without Dana it wouldn't have
happened. And he's, he's a nut.

2161
01:50:05,190 --> 01:50:07,310
He's obsessed with it and it loves it.
I talked,

2162
01:50:07,340 --> 01:50:10,070
we talked about fights last night
for about two and a half hours. Wow.

2163
01:50:10,370 --> 01:50:13,590
I called him last time we talked about
the Mark Hunt fight and all this crazy

2164
01:50:13,591 --> 01:50:16,110
shit that's going on right now.
And next weekend

2165
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:16,410
I,

2166
01:50:16,410 --> 01:50:20,480
my buddies who were bar
owners will deliberately not
have the UFC fight on why?

2167
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:21,500
Because they,

2168
01:50:21,500 --> 01:50:25,340
some of them believe that it attracts the
type of guy who like wants to get in a

2169
01:50:25,341 --> 01:50:28,280
fight that night. So two
to three hours, you know,

2170
01:50:28,281 --> 01:50:30,760
he's going to show up having some drinks
and he's going to happen to a lot more

2171
01:50:30,761 --> 01:50:33,650
than you think. I know a lot of bars
in Ohio that does the same thing.

2172
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:35,720
They stopped having the fights.
What bars do you know in Ohio?

2173
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:39,890
My friend owns a bar on that,
that it's like a pool bar.

2174
01:50:40,280 --> 01:50:41,600
I think they used to play there,

2175
01:50:41,601 --> 01:50:44,410
but then they always had
fights there so he's like,

2176
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:47,310
wow. Yeah. Well man, you add alcohol,

2177
01:50:47,311 --> 01:50:50,340
alcohol and a bunch of people watching
people kick people's asses and getting

2178
01:50:50,341 --> 01:50:53,190
their ass kicking.
Boners yeah,

2179
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:55,820
dude. Even in Raleigh at 2:00 AM at
some outside some of the bars, man.

2180
01:50:55,821 --> 01:50:58,630
And you see and get to fucking get you.
Imagine if there was a club,

2181
01:50:58,680 --> 01:50:59,371
uh,
men,

2182
01:50:59,371 --> 01:51:02,520
women club were men and women went there
where they just showed porn all over

2183
01:51:02,521 --> 01:51:03,180
the place.

2184
01:51:03,180 --> 01:51:07,710
They showed like big widescreen
videos of people having sex.

2185
01:51:08,070 --> 01:51:12,600
Did you imagine how, I mean, that would
like turn rapey really fucking quick.

2186
01:51:12,830 --> 01:51:16,170
Like very much like how the UFC,
like if you have the UFC and a bar,

2187
01:51:16,171 --> 01:51:19,770
people want to beat ass.
If you had I think first of all peoples,

2188
01:51:20,010 --> 01:51:22,890
it would be really interesting like
as a study if he gets some scientist

2189
01:51:22,891 --> 01:51:24,780
involved and seeing what me,

2190
01:51:24,781 --> 01:51:27,390
you couldn't really manipulate people
like that unless they volunteered.

2191
01:51:27,570 --> 01:51:32,570
But how many more people who watch the
porn wound up hooking up that night

2192
01:51:33,180 --> 01:51:36,930
versus how many people who didn't watch
porn and went to a regular bar? Yeah,

2193
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:39,030
I dunno actually that'd be fascinating,

2194
01:51:39,180 --> 01:51:43,500
but I mean what kind of
porn are we talking about?
Hardcore like fucking gagging,

2195
01:51:43,501 --> 01:51:46,560
Mascara, spit everything.
There's a Martinez

2196
01:51:46,610 --> 01:51:47,660
that in Los Angeles,

2197
01:51:47,780 --> 01:51:51,230
I think me and Duncan went there once and
in the back that just showed a woman's

2198
01:51:51,231 --> 01:51:52,690
gaping asshole in this day

2199
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:57,020
and it was just on a
projection on the wall.

2200
01:51:57,260 --> 01:51:59,500
And you're just sitting out there
looking at this girl getting like,

2201
01:51:59,530 --> 01:52:01,830
like wasn't like silver lake
or something like that. Yeah,

2202
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:05,870
of course there's a bar called like a
cozy car or something in San Francisco

2203
01:52:05,871 --> 01:52:10,830
where like he just does he car. That's
my nickname for him. Uh, but the cozy,

2204
01:52:10,831 --> 01:52:14,100
cause they have like all
the old playboy like, uh,

2205
01:52:14,300 --> 01:52:17,330
issues and pictorials like laminated and
the tables and everything that's kind

2206
01:52:17,331 --> 01:52:17,930
of mesmerized.

2207
01:52:17,930 --> 01:52:18,980
Well that's Kinda interesting.

2208
01:52:18,981 --> 01:52:21,560
The old ones especially because it's
like you're watching a piece of history

2209
01:52:21,561 --> 01:52:24,950
isn't even porn anymore when you know
that that lady is like 80 now you are not

2210
01:52:24,951 --> 01:52:28,190
beating off to that. I don't care how
hot she looked back then. You know,

2211
01:52:28,191 --> 01:52:31,300
there's very few people that beat off to
pictures of naked and Marilyn Monroe is

2212
01:52:31,301 --> 01:52:34,730
pretty issue was it says,
hmm, that's ancient.

2213
01:52:35,220 --> 01:52:38,250
I had a friend of mine who just was in
Delhi in India and she's speaking of like

2214
01:52:38,251 --> 01:52:40,710
Raby and she just like, you
know, she, she wore the full,

2215
01:52:40,740 --> 01:52:43,840
very little makeup just full on, like
showing no skin and everything. Shit.

2216
01:52:44,040 --> 01:52:46,020
She said, how many times
did she get her ass grabbed?

2217
01:52:46,020 --> 01:52:47,570
Didn't leave.
Like one of them was like an official,

2218
01:52:47,571 --> 01:52:51,340
like a guard at the Taj Mahal and uh, that
was, um, Kimra Verde. But it's just a,

2219
01:52:51,350 --> 01:52:53,000
my other friend who happens
to be Indian was taught,

2220
01:52:53,001 --> 01:52:55,280
we were talking about the Indian
rave culture and she says it's same.

2221
01:52:55,460 --> 01:52:57,080
It's fucking rough.
How did it happen?

2222
01:52:57,260 --> 01:53:00,710
How did it India become a place where
all these gang rapes keep occurring?

2223
01:53:01,010 --> 01:53:01,340
I mean,

2224
01:53:01,340 --> 01:53:05,280
is it being over sensationalized in the
media or is it really that fucking thing?

2225
01:53:05,300 --> 01:53:08,270
What I gather it's, it's pretty, yeah,
she felt very uncomfortable to share her.

2226
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:12,080
Her Facebook posts is like, you know,
India, you were amazing to visit, but the,

2227
01:53:12,081 --> 01:53:16,550
you know, some of the vibe I got was
really a little unsettling. Wow. She just,

2228
01:53:16,551 --> 01:53:21,200
she did like this world tour guys.
Damn, that's weird. What is that?

2229
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:21,830
And it's,
it's,

2230
01:53:21,830 --> 01:53:25,700
it's very weird when you see it and it
also coincides with a population of a

2231
01:53:25,701 --> 01:53:28,310
billion people because I always assume,

2232
01:53:28,610 --> 01:53:32,510
and this is just based on what I've
seen in regards to money and how people

2233
01:53:32,511 --> 01:53:35,600
treat each other,
and when you have too many people,

2234
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:40,430
when you have like too many
people, 20 million people,
whatever, a billion people,

2235
01:53:40,610 --> 01:53:44,900
you lose the value. It's like, it's
like there's no value in people.

2236
01:53:45,170 --> 01:53:47,940
There's too many of them. They
become invalue. They become, uh,

2237
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:50,600
they become a problem to
be around. Epic had a, Ah,

2238
01:53:50,601 --> 01:53:54,940
there's weird cultural things to epic.
Had a partnered with 10 set before I left.

2239
01:53:54,990 --> 01:53:58,520
As I said, I sold a bunch of stock and
everything and we got this like, you know,

2240
01:53:58,521 --> 01:54:01,010
what would you like to know if you're
gonna release a game in China and here are

2241
01:54:01,011 --> 01:54:03,620
things that are culturally allowed and
things that are kind of you should avoid.

2242
01:54:03,980 --> 01:54:05,270
And one of the things that was a big no,
no,

2243
01:54:05,271 --> 01:54:08,870
you couldn't have in your game was
any exposed bone like ain't no skulls.

2244
01:54:08,871 --> 01:54:11,570
If you had a Somby, like he couldn't
see any of the bone in it. It's just,

2245
01:54:11,860 --> 01:54:14,480
it was considered really like
you can't do it for some reason.

2246
01:54:14,990 --> 01:54:17,870
And the other thing was that if
there is a certain type of fear,

2247
01:54:17,871 --> 01:54:20,210
I remember what it's called,
where you're afraid of,

2248
01:54:20,211 --> 01:54:22,460
of densely packed holes like coral,

2249
01:54:22,850 --> 01:54:26,210
like in to avoid those kinds of patterns
in your game because a bunch of people

2250
01:54:26,330 --> 01:54:30,290
get freaked out by that. Apparently
densely packed holes like coral, freakout,

2251
01:54:30,350 --> 01:54:32,690
Chinese people.
That was what the pad,

2252
01:54:32,691 --> 01:54:35,720
the whole pamphlet said there's a name
for it, something of phobia. Right.

2253
01:54:35,750 --> 01:54:39,410
It's a coral, a phobia. It's not cause
it's not just coral, it's like you know,

2254
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:42,620
any sort of surface that it's very porous,
like that spongy type thing. Right.

2255
01:54:42,621 --> 01:54:44,470
And that's a cultural
thing. Yeah, it's cultural.

2256
01:54:44,471 --> 01:54:46,700
I don't know of it
existing in other places,

2257
01:54:46,701 --> 01:54:49,100
but I think apparently when they have a
billion people and you have, you know,

2258
01:54:49,101 --> 01:54:51,720
5% of the people affected with it.
While you may want to, you know,

2259
01:54:51,770 --> 01:54:52,460
keep that in mind.

2260
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:55,880
It is weird when you see how far people
go off the track when it comes to like

2261
01:54:55,881 --> 01:54:58,010
what their culture accepts
and expects of each other.

2262
01:54:58,300 --> 01:55:02,870
Like how bout Muslims where you're not
even allowed to draw Mohamad if you draw

2263
01:55:02,871 --> 01:55:05,360
him. Yeah. You know, like
little kids, Christian kids,

2264
01:55:05,361 --> 01:55:09,200
they can draw a picture of God with a
beard and the clouds do it as a part of

2265
01:55:09,201 --> 01:55:09,740
their,
you know,

2266
01:55:09,740 --> 01:55:13,010
first grade there's a Dutch cartoon is
to actually did it and like drew him with

2267
01:55:13,011 --> 01:55:16,880
like a bomb turban at one point and he
had like Fatois just issued for him at

2268
01:55:16,881 --> 01:55:19,350
the park. Yeah, yeah. Cause you're
talking about them earlier. Let's go.

2269
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:22,460
They got in trouble for it.
Book of Mormon committed to,

2270
01:55:22,461 --> 01:55:26,150
it's amazing that you could get that
far though, that a culture can get me,

2271
01:55:26,151 --> 01:55:27,350
you can call it a religion if you want,

2272
01:55:27,351 --> 01:55:28,940
but it's basically a pattern and behavior,

2273
01:55:29,140 --> 01:55:31,250
a pattern of behavior that a bunch
of people are willing to follow.

2274
01:55:31,251 --> 01:55:36,251
The get so far that if you write down or
draw your guy that you believe in just

2275
01:55:36,321 --> 01:55:37,880
drawn up.
I'm an atheist,

2276
01:55:37,910 --> 01:55:40,790
but I have friends who are very
religious and it's like whatever gets you

2277
01:55:40,791 --> 01:55:42,050
through the fucking day, if you, you know,

2278
01:55:42,051 --> 01:55:43,650
the thing is if you're
not hurting anybody else,

2279
01:55:43,830 --> 01:55:47,860
whatever it fucking works for you. You're
like a Beatles Song, man. You know,

2280
01:55:48,040 --> 01:55:50,430
you wanna, you wanna lead
people fucking tell him, uh,

2281
01:55:50,431 --> 01:55:52,410
you know what happens when you die.
Yeah,

2282
01:55:52,411 --> 01:55:54,190
that would definitely help
you ever see the movie.

2283
01:55:54,540 --> 01:55:56,700
Tell them that you found some magic shit.
Yeah.

2284
01:55:57,090 --> 01:55:59,190
You found some magic shit
that I'm telling you.

2285
01:55:59,191 --> 01:56:03,390
I'm going to sending me
information. I, Hey, I'm just a
conduit. I'm not, you're God.

2286
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:06,180
Yeah, but you're God's talking through
me. I want you to suck my Dick.

2287
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:09,030
I don't know why people,
people want something.

2288
01:56:09,090 --> 01:56:11,220
They want to be a part of something.
It's that tribal nature.

2289
01:56:11,221 --> 01:56:13,500
Fuck those guys over there. Why?
Because we're us in there. Them.

2290
01:56:13,740 --> 01:56:14,940
There's definitely that.
Right.

2291
01:56:15,140 --> 01:56:17,840
And did you even see it with
a nerd culture where it's
like, you know, are you a,

2292
01:56:17,841 --> 01:56:21,190
are you nerdy enough? Are you a real
quick, you're really using a Mac. Yeah.

2293
01:56:21,450 --> 01:56:22,620
And it's Mac or PC.

2294
01:56:22,621 --> 01:56:24,750
Same reason I'll tell my friends
like what kind of hardware I have.

2295
01:56:24,751 --> 01:56:27,750
Like in anything cause it's like, oh, you
should get a so and so. It's too much.

2296
01:56:27,950 --> 01:56:32,820
Or you're using the empty God. Yeah Dude.
God to this. So yesterday like you know,

2297
01:56:32,830 --> 01:56:35,570
getting like a TV for the gaming
room. Oh, that one's too laggy.

2298
01:56:35,571 --> 01:56:37,580
You shoot this guy and there's
always a better one coming out.

2299
01:56:37,590 --> 01:56:40,800
They should wait for it. Just not
ever have anything fucking Neri cons.

2300
01:56:40,830 --> 01:56:44,610
You have the both x-box nps for the new
one. You can just start shit right now.

2301
01:56:44,620 --> 01:56:46,020
So we're trying to get no,
I'm just saying it did.

2302
01:56:46,020 --> 01:56:49,510
Do you prefer one over the other one?
I'm all about Nintendo right now. Yeah,

2303
01:56:49,590 --> 01:56:52,230
the new Mario is fucking fantastic.
That new Zelda is great.

2304
01:56:52,670 --> 01:56:56,460
I tried the Xbox with your TV though.
Oh you don't have cable? Yeah, no,

2305
01:56:56,670 --> 01:57:00,020
we just use like Netflix and Hulu and
all that shit and we use Chromecast all

2306
01:57:00,021 --> 01:57:01,740
studies in the future,
isn't it dude?

2307
01:57:01,770 --> 01:57:04,770
I just seems like it right at time one
are made their own bed man. And you know,

2308
01:57:04,771 --> 01:57:07,980
more and more people are
cutting that fucking cable.
Netflix works so well. Yeah,

2309
01:57:08,130 --> 01:57:11,250
it's so well, I want everything
streaming on demand right now.

2310
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:15,870
Hulu plus works so well. All of
them work so well. I love, uh,

2311
01:57:15,930 --> 01:57:20,520
I love iTunes. I don't, I watched
the walking dead recently on TV.

2312
01:57:20,610 --> 01:57:24,770
Oh my God. I wanted to fucking kill some
parsley. It was every fucking 10 minutes.

2313
01:57:24,770 --> 01:57:28,420
It was a commercial. I was like,
this is such a bad way to watch a,

2314
01:57:28,470 --> 01:57:30,030
a gripping show.

2315
01:57:30,330 --> 01:57:33,730
All of the sudden it's dancing
potato chips and it's like,

2316
01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:36,780
it's like from the fifties and
sixties right. It's like a stay over.

2317
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:38,040
Well you know what it is,
man.

2318
01:57:38,070 --> 01:57:41,370
It's like television in the current
form where you have to watch it.

2319
01:57:41,371 --> 01:57:44,940
When it plays, you have to watch it
live. It's like silent movies, man.

2320
01:57:44,970 --> 01:57:47,430
It just doesn't work anymore.
Yeah, it's stupid. Yeah. Well,

2321
01:57:47,431 --> 01:57:49,350
so do you driving around La proper?

2322
01:57:49,351 --> 01:57:53,130
Like the amount of signs I've seen
for Netflix and Hulu original series,

2323
01:57:53,460 --> 01:57:54,960
like it's totally taking
over and they can take,

2324
01:57:54,961 --> 01:57:57,000
they can take more risks in those areas.

2325
01:57:57,001 --> 01:57:59,700
And same thing with the youtube
explosion, right? Like you know,

2326
01:57:59,730 --> 01:58:02,400
it's so many places are just getting
like little warehouses out and like

2327
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:03,720
whatever,
you know,

2328
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:07,050
city at to out here and
they're just making gold like
Freddy Wong's videos. Man.

2329
01:58:07,230 --> 01:58:08,320
Well,
there's so many pizza huts.

2330
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:12,240
They're doing these weird videos too
where they just stand in front of a camera

2331
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:16,350
and they start talking about something
and then they have all these quick edits.

2332
01:58:16,750 --> 01:58:20,640
It's like, you know, I grew up in this
click edit and then into the well,

2333
01:58:20,641 --> 01:58:25,200
and when I was a kid we like,
there's almost like no room for air and,

2334
01:58:25,400 --> 01:58:25,981
and they,
they,

2335
01:58:25,981 --> 01:58:30,981
they've edited like every breath or
pause in between every word and they have

2336
01:58:31,321 --> 01:58:34,950
this weird fast editing style. It's
like the draw my life stuff also. Right.

2337
01:58:34,951 --> 01:58:36,360
But it's really prevalent.
Like what,

2338
01:58:36,361 --> 01:58:40,950
how did that fast editing weird style
of Youtube video becomes so mimic? Well,

2339
01:58:40,951 --> 01:58:42,010
let me ask you a question.
Like

2340
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:44,850
for me, when I watch a youtube video,
if like it doesn't get interesting.

2341
01:58:44,851 --> 01:58:47,680
And then the third was the first 30
seconds I'm out. I'm like, I'm done.

2342
01:58:47,681 --> 01:58:52,330
Just like Geeky let, let's
get going. Yeah. I'm onto the
next video. Yeah, I guess,

2343
01:58:52,350 --> 01:58:54,900
do you know what I'd like to believe the
number one youtube subscribe person is

2344
01:58:54,970 --> 01:58:57,820
this kid. He's like, like finish or
something as names like Pubi die.

2345
01:58:58,180 --> 01:59:00,940
And he just streams videos of him playing
games and talking about them all the

2346
01:59:00,941 --> 01:59:05,170
time. He just gets insane views.
That's weird on the dean. You suck.

2347
01:59:05,171 --> 01:59:07,940
You can't predict it knows you're
good bone structure. Rebecca,

2348
01:59:07,941 --> 01:59:09,640
who's got finally released
a sequel to Friday,

2349
01:59:10,680 --> 01:59:13,890
did she really? Cause I saw that
online. Was that bullshit at Saturday?

2350
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:18,530
She really did make a song
called Saturday. Come on
man. And she put it online.

2351
01:59:18,600 --> 01:59:23,490
Yup. Okay. Million views and later I
didn't know that. Terrible. How bad is it?

2352
01:59:23,540 --> 01:59:27,260
Well she's kind of acting like she's a
little hung over and she partied too hard.

2353
01:59:27,261 --> 01:59:29,390
She's trying to get street credit.
Yeah. Talking about getting,

2354
01:59:29,391 --> 01:59:31,850
I'm thinking she needs the next one
should be Sunday fun day where she's like

2355
01:59:31,851 --> 01:59:34,520
drinking bloody Mary's getting all
fucked up or their friends too and coke

2356
01:59:34,550 --> 01:59:38,090
trying to stay up the side.
Leading the cycle continues

2357
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:43,270
blood under sox doesn't where it came
from. I did not know about this. Oh

2358
01:59:44,890 --> 01:59:45,723
hell yeah.

2359
01:59:50,190 --> 01:59:54,240
You're not in bed. Oh my
God. Oh my God. This is real.

2360
01:59:56,620 --> 01:59:58,560
So that sin too crazy.

2361
02:00:03,470 --> 02:00:08,430
Oh, she's got like a Miley parody girl
in here at some point, twerking and shit.

2362
02:00:08,460 --> 02:00:12,120
You know what? Here's the deal though.
This could have worked if it wasn't her.

2363
02:00:13,320 --> 02:00:17,700
Yeah. If they had no one in this video
was singing and they didn't show anybody

2364
02:00:17,701 --> 02:00:18,534
singing.

2365
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:22,500
There's enough people out there that
are almost retarded that they would buy

2366
02:00:22,501 --> 02:00:23,334
that.

2367
02:00:25,080 --> 02:00:26,710
It's the postmodern,
Rebecca Black.

2368
02:00:26,820 --> 02:00:29,400
It's all like me and my
friends from the Palisades.

2369
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:33,690
We're going to sit around and pretend
that this is what we do. Well,

2370
02:00:33,691 --> 02:00:38,070
we push each other on skateboards. We do
when we're high on Ahcccs. Yeah, right.

2371
02:00:38,370 --> 02:00:41,880
Like a cousin of mine, but my mom's
clothes were all in the water.

2372
02:00:41,881 --> 02:00:42,810
It looks like we're having fun,

2373
02:00:42,811 --> 02:00:46,290
but actually Billy just drown and we're
trying to find him or four who fell off

2374
02:00:46,291 --> 02:00:50,130
the dock and we can't tell his mom because
we have his car and he's fucking key

2375
02:00:50,131 --> 02:00:54,270
doesn't work because it's
underwater. Dude, fucking
Internet, man. This is weird.

2376
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:57,780
He's like, dude, dude, dude, like couldn't
find his pants. I mean, it's crazy.

2377
02:00:57,781 --> 02:00:58,770
They're nutty.
You know,

2378
02:00:58,771 --> 02:01:01,850
she got up at two o'clock she told you
it's two o'clock in the afternoon. Right.

2379
02:01:02,610 --> 02:01:05,910
Going to bed at like five which didn't
give a fuck. She went to bed at noon.

2380
02:01:06,030 --> 02:01:09,540
She went to bed at noon and got up at
two ready to fuck again. She's crazy.

2381
02:01:09,541 --> 02:01:10,740
She's doing blow.

2382
02:01:10,980 --> 02:01:14,920
She's fucking balloons full of
helium up around music factory

2383
02:01:15,710 --> 02:01:17,940
dude. When we were in a
that's like the, yeah,

2384
02:01:17,941 --> 02:01:18,970
they're the ones who
do all those meetings.

2385
02:01:18,980 --> 02:01:21,390
Those vanity music videos for like
the Bridge Orange County girls.

2386
02:01:21,540 --> 02:01:23,490
What are those?
It's like the Friday at all.

2387
02:01:24,160 --> 02:01:26,800
The company that it's called art music
factory. They'll come to you though.

2388
02:01:26,801 --> 02:01:30,190
So they, they, they basically
your Bat Mitzvah, you get
a music video or whatever.

2389
02:01:30,191 --> 02:01:32,820
Right? Oh my goodness. Don't
even play that Jamie. You fucked.

2390
02:01:32,830 --> 02:01:35,620
Scare the shit out of me right now.
I've had too much already.

2391
02:01:35,621 --> 02:01:36,690
I'm starting to shake.
It's like,

2392
02:01:37,090 --> 02:01:41,690
like not drinking coffee and drinking
cops all at once. I can't handle it.

2393
02:01:41,990 --> 02:01:45,020
It's too much girl band. Yeah,
there you go. Somebody tried to,

2394
02:01:45,050 --> 02:01:49,070
somebody tried to tell me like I walked
into a bookstore and the co why is,

2395
02:01:49,250 --> 02:01:53,330
why are they playing one direction? I go,
Eh, wrong question. The real question is,

2396
02:01:53,390 --> 02:01:56,030
who the fuck do you know that this
is one direction? Yeah, totally.

2397
02:01:56,060 --> 02:01:59,510
God Damn grown adult. It's a
cycle dude. Every 10 years,

2398
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:02,530
a couple years ago I'm like, oh boy.
Bands about set to come back and Yep.

2399
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:04,640
Just that trains on time. I, yeah,

2400
02:02:04,641 --> 02:02:08,480
I just felt that and I saw it in Vegas
for the first time in the elevator. I go,

2401
02:02:08,481 --> 02:02:11,600
what is this? I had to ask my friends,
what is this? Oh that's the new one.

2402
02:02:11,800 --> 02:02:15,820
It's a new boy van Mike.
How come I didn't see them coming here?

2403
02:02:15,830 --> 02:02:17,570
And they're huge already.
Like instantly.

2404
02:02:17,571 --> 02:02:19,430
It's such a weird
psychology for young girls.

2405
02:02:19,431 --> 02:02:23,420
They like those very like androgynous
dudes who were very nonthreatening of

2406
02:02:23,421 --> 02:02:26,060
course, cause they're dabbling in
the world of sexuality. You know,

2407
02:02:26,061 --> 02:02:31,061
if you had a bunch of fucking Andre
Arlovski lemonade fire open chess playing

2408
02:02:31,461 --> 02:02:35,930
guitar, sticking their tongue out with
giant rolled sock cock in their pants,

2409
02:02:35,931 --> 02:02:40,600
like in leather, you know, tight pants,
big giant thighs, custom made thighs,

2410
02:02:40,990 --> 02:02:41,210
you know,

2411
02:02:41,210 --> 02:02:46,210
it has to bother giant legs and is big
snake like cock pressed up against this

2412
02:02:46,370 --> 02:02:49,310
upper hip. You know, that's
too much for a little girl.

2413
02:02:49,311 --> 02:02:50,680
It was just starting to learn our ways.

2414
02:02:50,690 --> 02:02:54,770
Just starting to figure out what our
friend means the end of every month and

2415
02:02:54,771 --> 02:02:58,340
Japanese boy bands or even worse. I don't
know if you've ever seen those. Oh yeah,

2416
02:02:58,341 --> 02:02:59,840
I have.
And K pop.

2417
02:02:59,841 --> 02:03:03,550
There's a lot of weird and druggies shit
going on with Japanese people. They,

2418
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:05,450
they're into a lot of
weird androgynous shit.

2419
02:03:05,451 --> 02:03:09,860
There was a guy who was an Androgynous,
a kickboxer. He's actually very good.

2420
02:03:10,220 --> 02:03:14,090
He was a,
he was in the Mangia I guess that is some,

2421
02:03:14,180 --> 02:03:17,310
some character or Manga. Manga.
Yeah, that's how you say it. Yeah.

2422
02:03:17,630 --> 02:03:22,100
Character Jessop but he was
a bad ass. Kickboxer let me
find out. Let me say like,

2423
02:03:22,700 --> 02:03:25,430
give me shit. I'll kick your
ass. Yeah. No, he was legit.

2424
02:03:25,431 --> 02:03:29,090
And he was fighting in a k
one max. Dude, I saw a video.

2425
02:03:29,091 --> 02:03:32,630
Did you know Seattle has this a law where
if two people agree to fight there you,

2426
02:03:32,631 --> 02:03:36,260
they can just fight in the street and
then somebody falls and they have to stop.

2427
02:03:37,010 --> 02:03:40,790
Say that again. What? So
Phoenix Jones is that real life
superhero? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2428
02:03:40,850 --> 02:03:43,040
It's called willful combat
or something like that.

2429
02:03:43,041 --> 02:03:45,330
You combat and there's a viral
video of him in the suit. Dude.

2430
02:03:45,340 --> 02:03:48,140
He just would not leave him alone. Who's
hammered in Phoenix? Just dropped him.

2431
02:03:49,100 --> 02:03:51,110
Yeah.
That's guys are fucking hilarious.

2432
02:03:51,111 --> 02:03:53,900
Is that guy dresses up like a
superhero and he's an MMA fighter.

2433
02:03:53,901 --> 02:03:55,460
He's a really bad ass fighter. Yeah. Yeah.

2434
02:03:55,461 --> 02:03:59,510
This is a woo shinny shin.

2435
02:03:59,570 --> 02:04:03,320
This is the androgynous Japanese boy band.

2436
02:04:03,890 --> 02:04:07,900
There's a whole thing. It's Korean. Are
They Korean? I think this one is, yeah.

2437
02:04:07,960 --> 02:04:10,850
Right. The same thing I like with they
move. I'm going to tell you right now,

2438
02:04:10,851 --> 02:04:11,780
I'm not ashamed to admit it.

2439
02:04:12,870 --> 02:04:13,703
Yeah.

2440
02:04:14,290 --> 02:04:15,340
Pretty good.
Production values.

2441
02:04:19,990 --> 02:04:20,890
Yeah.
That's K-pop.

2442
02:04:26,020 --> 02:04:30,770
Gotcha. Hero. Uh, Nakashima.
That's a the dude's name pro.

2443
02:04:30,771 --> 02:04:33,920
Pull up a video. Him, Brian, you, y.

2444
02:04:33,921 --> 02:04:38,921
U.

2445
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:39,780
I. C. H. I. R. O. Nagashima k.

2446
02:04:39,780 --> 02:04:44,490
One kickboxing is videos
of him looking like a girl.

2447
02:04:44,640 --> 02:04:49,640
He comes out with a dress on a skirt and
a crazy wig on and he's dancing fucks

2448
02:04:50,401 --> 02:04:53,760
people up. It's even cooler that
he goes. Yeah, he's bad ass man.

2449
02:04:53,820 --> 02:04:56,820
I've seen the dude fight a bunch of times
and apparently when he first started

2450
02:04:56,821 --> 02:04:59,160
he actually wasn't that good and got,
you know,

2451
02:04:59,161 --> 02:05:01,530
people were like teasing
him because of his, uh,

2452
02:05:01,560 --> 02:05:03,990
his outfit and all those shitty then
two and then he got really good dude.

2453
02:05:03,991 --> 02:05:04,840
That's fucked up.

2454
02:05:05,380 --> 02:05:08,790
You play counterstrike with people who
are better than you and you get better.

2455
02:05:09,260 --> 02:05:12,930
Cliffy beats dropping knowledge,
I think had to be the best you you can be.

2456
02:05:13,870 --> 02:05:17,910
That's the PSA. The more you know, I
think I went to his last a UFC fight.

2457
02:05:17,911 --> 02:05:21,360
He hasn't fought since then. He was
like, oh, this is against Kraus.

2458
02:05:21,361 --> 02:05:25,340
He's probably gonna get fucked up below.
Krause's a bad dude.

2459
02:05:25,610 --> 02:05:29,480
Push it ahead though. Yeah, but look
at this dance is like this. This is,

2460
02:05:29,481 --> 02:05:32,390
he has this whole like choreographed
thing that he comes out to.

2461
02:05:33,680 --> 02:05:37,190
Holy Shit, he's the best he's
fighting now but cross though.

2462
02:05:37,230 --> 02:05:39,900
Who's a multiple time
champion from Holland?

2463
02:05:40,540 --> 02:05:44,230
I don't know who won the fight but I
would imagine cross it have an advantage.

2464
02:05:47,380 --> 02:05:48,790
This is must be in Japan.

2465
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:54,000
They use the k one max was like a big
kickboxing organization to deal with the

2466
02:05:54,161 --> 02:05:57,280
fact that there was a lot of like really
talented guys that were at a lighter

2467
02:05:57,281 --> 02:06:02,281
weight cause Japa Japan put really high
level boxing worldwide on the map with k

2468
02:06:02,781 --> 02:06:06,200
one and then the k one
was all heavyweight guys.

2469
02:06:06,410 --> 02:06:10,430
So they went from that to a k one max,
which is all guys.

2470
02:06:10,431 --> 02:06:14,180
I think the weight limit was like, I
think it was 160 pounds. I'm not sure,

2471
02:06:14,390 --> 02:06:19,220
but like go, go ahead. So you
could see him fighting this
dude. He was bad ass man.

2472
02:06:19,250 --> 02:06:23,540
Even though he, oh he got k
the fuck out. I said, man,

2473
02:06:24,150 --> 02:06:26,990
he's fighting Albert Cross. He's going
to get fucked up. And I was correct.

2474
02:06:27,650 --> 02:06:32,300
Look at this. Boom, Bang. There's
your wig, here's your concussion.

2475
02:06:32,570 --> 02:06:34,880
There's your skirt pull ahead,

2476
02:06:34,970 --> 02:06:37,290
pulled way before that so you
could see like some of the fight.

2477
02:06:37,290 --> 02:06:40,640
He's actually a good fighter.
Just the guy he's fighting is like super,

2478
02:06:40,641 --> 02:06:45,320
super high level. You really should
never be in against this guy doing.

2479
02:06:45,500 --> 02:06:49,340
He's like some blow out but he's,
yeah, he's like a step below.

2480
02:06:49,341 --> 02:06:53,180
But what they would do in Japan,
they didn't give a fuck man.

2481
02:06:53,390 --> 02:06:56,840
That's the first round two, that's 50
minutes and 50 seconds in the first round.

2482
02:06:57,470 --> 02:07:01,350
Put it up to the beginning when Japan
would have a lot of freak shows.

2483
02:07:01,370 --> 02:07:05,850
That was one of the things that they had
a real problem with with pride and uh,

2484
02:07:06,110 --> 02:07:11,110
some of the matches they would do in k
one they would put too many people that

2485
02:07:11,211 --> 02:07:15,380
didn't have any chance at all together
and they would have guys just get

2486
02:07:15,381 --> 02:07:20,210
slaughtered. Just guys fight guys that
they had no business fighting these dudes.

2487
02:07:20,480 --> 02:07:23,150
And this is one of those instances.
I is a beast.

2488
02:07:23,870 --> 02:07:26,060
Crouse has been around
a long fucking time too.

2489
02:07:26,061 --> 02:07:27,680
I think he's probably
got a hundred fights.

2490
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:34,240
He's fought like the best of the past
to like high level competition and like

2491
02:07:34,580 --> 02:07:36,080
this of like Holland

2492
02:07:36,120 --> 02:07:39,130
kickboxer and he kind
of embodies that style.

2493
02:07:39,190 --> 02:07:42,160
I think John Cusack's character and say
anything had it right when he said it's

2494
02:07:42,161 --> 02:07:45,580
the sport of the future. John
Cusack was ahead of his time, Bro.

2495
02:07:45,730 --> 02:07:49,190
John Cusak is great on Twitter
by the way. Say that. Yeah,

2496
02:07:49,191 --> 02:07:51,130
I've got John Cusak speaks his mind.

2497
02:07:51,640 --> 02:07:56,590
He's a very intelligent and Rob Delaney
of uh, Nona I think so maybe online,

2498
02:07:56,620 --> 02:08:01,390
maybe on Twitter. My favorite thing
was, uh, he tweeted a shrinking,

2499
02:08:01,450 --> 02:08:03,940
uh, drinking come makes
pineapple juice tastes delicious.

2500
02:08:04,870 --> 02:08:07,370
And then I retweeted that and I got close
to be right. I've got victory. It's the,

2501
02:08:07,870 --> 02:08:11,350
he's flipped the joke though, cause it's
supposed to say drink. I get it. I get it.

2502
02:08:11,351 --> 02:08:15,090
Which was fucking everything. Everything
he tweets. It's just amazing. Uh,

2503
02:08:15,270 --> 02:08:17,050
it's fucking one of the
best Twitter's out there.

2504
02:08:18,150 --> 02:08:22,090
Why are you saying that Brian it
disagreeing. Let my stomach hurts. Don't,

2505
02:08:22,091 --> 02:08:25,960
don't disagree Bryan, the shits rude
dude. I fucking love him on Twitter. Okay.

2506
02:08:25,961 --> 02:08:26,711
You guys are going to fight.

2507
02:08:26,711 --> 02:08:29,140
I'm going to leave the room because I
don't like to be here for this shit.

2508
02:08:29,170 --> 02:08:33,160
Whatever you do, do not put your name
and the word Kimmel and the same thing.

2509
02:08:33,250 --> 02:08:35,590
All right. Do you won't
find it anywhere? No,

2510
02:08:35,620 --> 02:08:40,030
don't put his name in the word Kimmel.
You're holding your tongue,

2511
02:08:40,350 --> 02:08:43,310
Brian. You tell me this
after the podcast then. Huh?

2512
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:46,660
Wait like there's something you're
withholding. Nothing. Nothing.

2513
02:08:46,690 --> 02:08:49,630
I don't follow them on Twitter.
I don't follow him on Twitter,

2514
02:08:49,660 --> 02:08:53,860
but I saw him on camel once and
it was one of those performances.

2515
02:08:53,861 --> 02:08:57,800
I guess he probably wasn't happy
with it either, but it was so like,

2516
02:08:57,850 --> 02:08:59,470
who is this guy?
How did he get on Campbell?

2517
02:08:59,800 --> 02:09:01,330
And then I looked him up and was like,
Holy Shit.

2518
02:09:01,330 --> 02:09:05,200
He's huge on Twitter and everything and
they had never seen his life. Comedy,

2519
02:09:05,580 --> 02:09:07,240
twitters, you know, he got in early too.

2520
02:09:07,241 --> 02:09:10,810
And I think Twitter is one of those things
where you literally can go viral and

2521
02:09:10,811 --> 02:09:14,380
just be a regular person who says
something funny and one person sees it and

2522
02:09:14,381 --> 02:09:15,340
they sent it to other people in.

2523
02:09:15,341 --> 02:09:18,360
The next thing you know you've
got a million followers. Poppins,

2524
02:09:18,430 --> 02:09:20,740
a lot also is when Twitter
first came out they,

2525
02:09:20,741 --> 02:09:23,880
I guess they added to the people
you should follow lists. Yeah.

2526
02:09:24,160 --> 02:09:25,150
And there's so many people.

2527
02:09:25,151 --> 02:09:27,430
Like I met a comic the other day that
has like almost a million. I'm like,

2528
02:09:27,431 --> 02:09:28,360
I've never heard of this guy.

2529
02:09:28,630 --> 02:09:32,470
And he told me it was because that
Twitter put him on some list once and then

2530
02:09:32,471 --> 02:09:35,440
every time you signed up for Twitter
you automatically just added him.

2531
02:09:35,870 --> 02:09:39,500
So that's a good list to get on.
Yeah. But I mean the thing is is you,

2532
02:09:39,501 --> 02:09:42,520
you guys know as well as I do like
the risk of having a lot of followers.

2533
02:09:42,521 --> 02:09:45,420
It's not necessarily mean there's a
lot of engaged followers. Like I'll,

2534
02:09:45,421 --> 02:09:45,971
I'll just click on,

2535
02:09:45,971 --> 02:09:48,730
some people have like 2 million followers
and I'll tweet something relatively

2536
02:09:48,731 --> 02:09:51,430
funny and like it'd be
like three retweets. Right?

2537
02:09:51,431 --> 02:09:52,820
And then you get like somebody
who has like, you know,

2538
02:09:52,840 --> 02:09:55,330
100,000 and then they tweet something
really funny and next thing you know,

2539
02:09:55,331 --> 02:09:59,710
5,000 retweets. It's not a precise
science, but it's fun. Yeah.

2540
02:09:59,711 --> 02:10:03,130
There's a lot of people buy and Twitter
followers and they don't really even get

2541
02:10:03,131 --> 02:10:07,000
Twitter followers. They get like robots.
Yeah. It just makes your number look good.

2542
02:10:07,320 --> 02:10:08,710
Yeah. Bullshit. There's a website,

2543
02:10:08,711 --> 02:10:11,770
you can look up people's Twitter names
and see how many are real fake Bot.

2544
02:10:11,860 --> 02:10:12,693
Oh really?

2545
02:10:13,060 --> 02:10:15,130
They know how many got in trouble
because he was buying a whole bunch of

2546
02:10:15,131 --> 02:10:20,050
followers and they during the election.
Yeah. But it's not bad. Is it bad to do?

2547
02:10:20,051 --> 02:10:22,270
Like if someone does that,
it makes them look less legit.

2548
02:10:22,300 --> 02:10:24,130
That's what it makes it look correct.
But yeah, because then, you know,

2549
02:10:24,131 --> 02:10:27,610
you have a comedy club or somebody
goes, wow, this guy has 2 million hits.

2550
02:10:27,790 --> 02:10:30,010
That's a lot of people that
we can get into this comedy.

2551
02:10:30,610 --> 02:10:34,130
Take those numbers very seriously.
It's what if you were funny guy,

2552
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:36,950
say if you're funny guy and uh,
people don't really know yet,

2553
02:10:36,970 --> 02:10:38,060
but you're pretty good.

2554
02:10:38,061 --> 02:10:40,880
And you find out that you could do that
and then all of a sudden you can get

2555
02:10:40,881 --> 02:10:45,560
work. I could see people justifying
that would only work so much.

2556
02:10:45,870 --> 02:10:47,450
You're funny already.
I mean it's like,

2557
02:10:47,451 --> 02:10:51,830
let's take a guy like a that people don't
know, like, okay. Like perfect example,

2558
02:10:51,910 --> 02:10:56,360
a Joey Diaz five years ago, five years
ago, nobody knew who Joey Diaz was.

2559
02:10:56,570 --> 02:11:00,920
If you could get Joey d as 250,000
Twitter followers and then like let a club

2560
02:11:00,921 --> 02:11:05,060
know like, Hey, this guy, 200,000
Twitter followers, people love him. Okay.

2561
02:11:05,061 --> 02:11:08,360
That seems like a lot. Okay, well
let's try them and then boom. Yeah,

2562
02:11:08,361 --> 02:11:10,460
but none of this, that's what we're saying
is this, Twitter flowers aren't real.

2563
02:11:10,461 --> 02:11:13,970
So they wouldn't come to this
show. Uh, yeah. But they would get,

2564
02:11:14,080 --> 02:11:16,640
he would get hired, he
would get, it wouldn't work.

2565
02:11:16,640 --> 02:11:19,280
It would only work a couple of times until
the clubs go, wait a second, you know,

2566
02:11:19,281 --> 02:11:21,610
bringing in in the ass.
Yeah.

2567
02:11:21,740 --> 02:11:25,310
Maybe he had an offer to tweet about
some sort of new Doritos for like money.

2568
02:11:25,620 --> 02:11:29,490
Like how much I was like, how much
free grand a tweet. Oh three granted,

2569
02:11:29,540 --> 02:11:32,990
tweet for real. I could buy some
dirty, no, wait a minute. Hold on.

2570
02:11:33,200 --> 02:11:36,770
They pay you to tweet about Doritos.
The offer. I couldn't do it.

2571
02:11:36,771 --> 02:11:40,370
I was employed at epic at the
time. Oh, that's interesting.

2572
02:11:40,530 --> 02:11:44,150
How many people are getting paid to tweet
and what is the most I need to start

2573
02:11:44,151 --> 02:11:46,880
doing it. I want to make
sure I'm not going to do it,

2574
02:11:46,881 --> 02:11:48,440
but I'm going to make sure
that everybody knows right now.

2575
02:11:48,441 --> 02:11:50,780
I've never been paid to tweet ever.
I've been accused of it before,

2576
02:11:50,781 --> 02:11:53,600
but when I tweet about something, if I
like it, it's just because it's cool.

2577
02:11:53,660 --> 02:11:56,300
That's, that's, that's the key ran and
it's like you can start taking that money,

2578
02:11:56,301 --> 02:11:58,580
but then you're Craig starts
going down. You can't, I tell him,

2579
02:11:58,581 --> 02:12:01,850
I don't think you can't. I can't. I was
saying, unless it was something we could,

2580
02:12:01,851 --> 02:12:04,220
but if you did then nobody would
believe anything. If you're like,

2581
02:12:04,221 --> 02:12:06,910
I like this thing. They were like, do you
like it? Are you being paid for? Okay,

2582
02:12:06,950 --> 02:12:09,710
well let's, let's have a, but
how about a, for instance,

2583
02:12:09,860 --> 02:12:13,550
what if you're a known enthusiasts of
certain things like you like Nice cars?

2584
02:12:13,670 --> 02:12:17,360
What if Ferrari says, hey, we want to
pay you to tweet about the four, five,

2585
02:12:17,361 --> 02:12:20,720
eight Italia. All right,
it's fucking awesome car.

2586
02:12:21,050 --> 02:12:23,750
You want me to just let people know that
I think it's awesome. It's indisputable.

2587
02:12:23,751 --> 02:12:28,340
It's awesome. I would do that. But
you know, if someone stainless,

2588
02:12:28,341 --> 02:12:31,310
so it's four five beats a little
girly looking actually, how dare you?

2589
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:35,110
How dare you? Are you an [inaudible] guy?
Put that next to the event authority.

2590
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:38,870
That's a B. That's a bitch car. That's
for guys. You need way too much tension.

2591
02:12:39,260 --> 02:12:42,440
It's not good for you to an event to door.
That's like silly. What are you Batman?

2592
02:12:42,890 --> 02:12:45,530
What are you doing with that?
Stupid. If it's blacked out to,

2593
02:12:45,550 --> 02:12:47,630
you should see it in Raleigh. Dude,
it's a funny, you have one of those,

2594
02:12:47,631 --> 02:12:48,740
an event to door.
How dare you?

2595
02:12:49,370 --> 02:12:52,220
How dare you drive the Aventador
and she drives the Giardo Llp.

2596
02:12:52,221 --> 02:12:53,810
Five 60 to Bojangles.

2597
02:12:53,900 --> 02:12:58,430
See the Giardo is much more realistic
vehicle to be driving around event doors.

2598
02:12:58,490 --> 02:13:00,230
That's a fucking Batmobile.
It looks like.

2599
02:13:00,231 --> 02:13:03,410
If you would ask an eight year old what
his dream car would be, how fast is it?

2600
02:13:03,590 --> 02:13:07,730
It's pretty fucking fast. It's was
six to 16 2.8 is it scary to drive?

2601
02:13:08,290 --> 02:13:11,930
It's not as scary as the
older Lamborghini's. They've
refined it a lot. Traction,

2602
02:13:11,931 --> 02:13:14,570
control and all that. Yeah. Yeah,
they are. Conditioning works. Right?

2603
02:13:14,571 --> 02:13:17,120
So if Aventador came to you and
said, hey, we want to pay you,

2604
02:13:17,150 --> 02:13:19,840
you would do it now they should pay me
retroactively because I tweeted out of

2605
02:13:19,841 --> 02:13:21,680
the damn thing all the time.
They should pay you.

2606
02:13:21,681 --> 02:13:24,770
Listen to how arrogant coffee be is.
He wants money from Lamborghini.

2607
02:13:25,540 --> 02:13:28,790
This motherfucker, he believe this shit.
He thinks Lamborghini owes him money.

2608
02:13:29,390 --> 02:13:32,460
Unbelievable. No. [inaudible]
it's a niche business.

2609
02:13:32,461 --> 02:13:35,490
You should be happy to
support them because if it
wasn't for Lamborghini making

2610
02:13:35,491 --> 02:13:36,324
Lamborghinis,

2611
02:13:36,360 --> 02:13:39,510
nobody would be making Lamborghinis and
you'd be left out in the car with no

2612
02:13:39,511 --> 02:13:42,270
Batmobile. Fair enough. What would
you get if you didn't have that?

2613
02:13:42,271 --> 02:13:45,840
Would you go Ferrari or do you think
it's too girly? Mclaren. Mclaren, yeah.

2614
02:13:46,110 --> 02:13:50,140
Mclaren is don't sound good.
Yeah, that's a problem. These are,

2615
02:13:50,190 --> 02:13:52,230
there's something missing.
You know that new car.

2616
02:13:52,231 --> 02:13:54,960
I've got up thing up Mclaren's new car.

2617
02:13:54,990 --> 02:13:58,470
I've gotten this unbelievably classic
poner too lately. Like the Shelby Cobra.

2618
02:13:58,590 --> 02:13:59,970
Yes.
And then I,

2619
02:13:59,971 --> 02:14:03,330
there was one at a car show
and I've learned at that
the real ones go for like a

2620
02:14:03,331 --> 02:14:06,530
million. Oh yeah. Like I had no idea.
Yeah, but you can get a replicant.

2621
02:14:06,540 --> 02:14:09,000
It's just fun to drive. Exactly.
You know, probably better.

2622
02:14:09,001 --> 02:14:11,830
You can get a bit better brakes and shit.
Everything as well.

2623
02:14:11,850 --> 02:14:14,880
Those guys would get those old muscle
cars and they have them stocked.

2624
02:14:14,881 --> 02:14:18,330
Like I get it. You're driving like a
little time machine. I like, you know,

2625
02:14:18,350 --> 02:14:22,410
you like the fact that it has like shitty
steering and shitty breaks. Safety man.

2626
02:14:22,470 --> 02:14:25,170
Safety is fine. Yeah. It's like a rhino
on rollerskates and those fucking,

2627
02:14:25,440 --> 02:14:26,530
I'm fucking like a,

2628
02:14:26,580 --> 02:14:28,920
I lost my fucking nephew a couple
of years ago in a car accident.

2629
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:31,140
I'm just like fucking safety.
Safety, safety man. Well,

2630
02:14:31,141 --> 02:14:32,820
people have asked me about this recently,

2631
02:14:32,821 --> 02:14:34,410
I think I've talked about on the podcast,

2632
02:14:34,411 --> 02:14:37,680
but I got rid of this Barracuda that I
had because I was driving on the highway

2633
02:14:37,950 --> 02:14:41,760
and I got home, I pulled into my
driveway and I was, I was making a turn.

2634
02:14:41,761 --> 02:14:46,761
All the sudden the suspension
came detached from the
frame and the front wheel

2635
02:14:46,951 --> 02:14:51,270
went sideways and stuck up into the fender
like at a nowhere. I was just turning,

2636
02:14:51,420 --> 02:14:53,310
I mean I was in my driveway,
there wasn't,

2637
02:14:53,460 --> 02:14:57,900
there was nothing crazy I was doing and
I was on the highway just minutes before

2638
02:14:57,901 --> 02:15:01,620
that going like 70 miles an hour.
And if that flew off,

2639
02:15:01,650 --> 02:15:05,160
I easily could be dead right now.
And so I got it all fixed.

2640
02:15:05,161 --> 02:15:06,960
Look at that fucking thing
that it's sexy as shit,

2641
02:15:06,990 --> 02:15:10,020
right with yellow and black like
that fucking Bumblebee from hell.

2642
02:15:10,050 --> 02:15:12,960
That's awesome.
So I got it fixed perfectly.

2643
02:15:13,020 --> 02:15:15,360
I brought it to a place
that it was too low.

2644
02:15:15,361 --> 02:15:19,470
It was bottoming out and the bottom
of the bolt was hitting pavement on a

2645
02:15:19,471 --> 02:15:22,590
regular basis. We broke off
actually. So I had to have the,

2646
02:15:22,591 --> 02:15:25,290
I have the whole thing reconstructed,
done correctly,

2647
02:15:25,291 --> 02:15:27,060
and then got rid of the fucking,
the Lambo is,

2648
02:15:27,061 --> 02:15:29,370
have the button to raise the
front up by like four inches.

2649
02:15:29,940 --> 02:15:32,770
There's a company that's doing, um, um,

2650
02:15:33,300 --> 02:15:37,920
a VX challenger and it's
fucking bad ass man.

2651
02:15:37,950 --> 02:15:39,330
They've figured out a way.

2652
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:44,220
Is that an Vieques XV XV challenger?
Hold on.

2653
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:48,900
They take these old cars like old muscle
cars like barracudas. Yeah, that's it.

2654
02:15:49,170 --> 02:15:53,010
Pull this thing up. Xv Challenger,
they take these old muscle cars,

2655
02:15:53,011 --> 02:15:55,800
but they put a modern suspension in it.

2656
02:15:55,801 --> 02:15:58,050
It's completely designed
just for this car.

2657
02:15:58,290 --> 02:16:01,710
So they figured out how to take these old,

2658
02:16:01,711 --> 02:16:06,711
like really heavy cars and just completely
redesigned the suspension to her.

2659
02:16:07,390 --> 02:16:11,730
Drives like a corvette, but it looks like
an old muscle car. Oh look how wicked.

2660
02:16:11,731 --> 02:16:15,330
That's awesome dude. Have you seen the
other then? He's sting rays gorgeous.

2661
02:16:15,390 --> 02:16:19,920
Oh yeah. It's incredible. Like for
just American muscle mass sport,

2662
02:16:20,190 --> 02:16:23,590
the uh, the guy who does the
smoking, tire.com, the, uh,

2663
02:16:23,610 --> 02:16:27,430
he does a bunch of videos for
drive as well. And drive tuned. He,

2664
02:16:27,610 --> 02:16:29,920
he sent me a tweet about it
immediately. He's like, he, you got to

2665
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:33,340
find out how you can get in one of these
things is the most incredible car that

2666
02:16:33,400 --> 02:16:36,820
corvette has ever built. It's
insane. It's just gorgeous.

2667
02:16:36,821 --> 02:16:41,290
Like nailed it everywhere. They nailed
the interior. They nailed the exterior,

2668
02:16:41,291 --> 02:16:43,810
they nailed the specs.
They nailed the performance.

2669
02:16:43,811 --> 02:16:46,580
They nailed the build quality
like people are driving and going,

2670
02:16:46,610 --> 02:16:49,330
this is like a fucking masterpiece.
This is those.

2671
02:16:49,390 --> 02:16:52,270
Those Audi sedans lately
are just gorgeous too. Well,

2672
02:16:52,271 --> 02:16:55,990
GM has been knocking it out of the
fucking park lately because they also have

2673
02:16:56,080 --> 02:16:59,710
the new Camaro and then the Camaro
z 28 which they just released,

2674
02:16:59,711 --> 02:17:03,520
which goes around the Nurburgring as
fast as a Porsche nine 11 turbo for like

2675
02:17:03,521 --> 02:17:06,460
less than half the price. It's the
scariest, fastest car I've ever been.

2676
02:17:06,461 --> 02:17:08,800
It was a benign 11 turbo,
one of my older coworkers.

2677
02:17:08,801 --> 02:17:10,780
That thing was just fucking terrifying.
Yeah.

2678
02:17:10,781 --> 02:17:12,340
I had one of those at one point in time.

2679
02:17:12,370 --> 02:17:15,910
I had a m nine nine six nine 11 turbo,

2680
02:17:15,911 --> 02:17:20,110
which was the first water cooled
one broke down like crazy.

2681
02:17:20,410 --> 02:17:21,280
Fun fact is a,

2682
02:17:21,310 --> 02:17:25,450
they used my event doors sound for some
of the reference for the new Forza game.

2683
02:17:26,170 --> 02:17:29,450
Well that was one thing that Lamborghini
got right is the sound Lamborghini and

2684
02:17:29,460 --> 02:17:32,860
for Ron shoot out the back of it. When
I, when I get past 80,000 rpm. Yeah,

2685
02:17:32,861 --> 02:17:34,290
there's a video where you uh,

2686
02:17:34,300 --> 02:17:37,980
guys cooking a sausage using the back
of an invented door cause so many flames

2687
02:17:37,981 --> 02:17:39,940
were shooting out of it.
My wife's like, honey,

2688
02:17:39,941 --> 02:17:43,390
you may not want to read that at the gas
station. That's bad ass. I would done it.

2689
02:17:43,391 --> 02:17:47,130
And what is the, um, the
actual horsepower? God,

2690
02:17:47,670 --> 02:17:50,470
it's like six something,
six 98 or something like that.

2691
02:17:52,060 --> 02:17:54,050
Apparently there's a game where, and
I haven't done it yet, where you,

2692
02:17:54,051 --> 02:17:56,500
you put a hundred dollar
bill on the passenger,

2693
02:17:56,501 --> 02:17:59,140
like dash and tell them if you can
grab that in the next four seconds,

2694
02:17:59,141 --> 02:18:03,850
he can keep it because the, the
forest is so strong. Really? Wow.

2695
02:18:03,890 --> 02:18:07,960
Well it's a honestly, man,
it's way too much. It's orange.

2696
02:18:07,990 --> 02:18:10,750
It's just driving an orange
car. You silly bitch. I do.

2697
02:18:10,990 --> 02:18:13,960
How dare you to actually be
matte black. Maybe. Dude,

2698
02:18:13,961 --> 02:18:18,190
I've caused the accidents
but people gawking I bet
that's it right there. Right?

2699
02:18:18,400 --> 02:18:19,810
Here we go.
He's going to cook the sausage.

2700
02:18:22,690 --> 02:18:26,020
Oh, that's a cool dad.
It's all digital. Yeah,

2701
02:18:26,700 --> 02:18:28,380
there we go. Wow. That's insane.

2702
02:18:33,140 --> 02:18:33,973
Okay.

2703
02:18:34,340 --> 02:18:37,850
I changed my mind. That's probably the
dopest thing I've ever seen. I'm a child.

2704
02:18:37,851 --> 02:18:41,240
If you show me flames coming out of
the car, you when dude the doors,

2705
02:18:41,480 --> 02:18:46,250
like it's like you roll up somewhere and
it's just like opening that thing and

2706
02:18:46,251 --> 02:18:49,790
get, now it's just like the, you
know, kill bill music plays down.

2707
02:18:50,210 --> 02:18:52,130
Do you like driving it though?
Is it a fun car to drive?

2708
02:18:52,160 --> 02:18:53,250
It's not as fun as the guy.

2709
02:18:53,360 --> 02:18:56,900
A LP five 60 cause you got a
nice like 75 degree Raleigh Day.

2710
02:18:56,901 --> 02:19:00,770
Put the top down in that thing and it was
just golden. And the thing is, you know,

2711
02:19:00,830 --> 02:19:04,470
you can I speed just in short bursts
very carefully. You know, like,

2712
02:19:04,471 --> 02:19:07,160
because knock on wood, never had a
ticket to any of my sports cars ever.

2713
02:19:07,370 --> 02:19:08,780
Well they're fun.
That's what people don't realize.

2714
02:19:08,781 --> 02:19:12,350
Like they're fun to just drive around
and necessarily even have to drive fast.

2715
02:19:12,350 --> 02:19:15,050
Just take it a corner of 35 miles an hour
in a car like that. It was really fun.

2716
02:19:15,051 --> 02:19:19,670
The best thing to do in a
car like, oh, what is that
Brian? It's one of those cars.

2717
02:19:19,880 --> 02:19:24,110
Yeah, but why is it all
fucking get weirded out now?
It's just [inaudible]. Oh,

2718
02:19:24,111 --> 02:19:27,910
they tried it out. It looks, she's like,
she's fucking terrible. It's, Oh my God.

2719
02:19:27,930 --> 02:19:31,010
It was a Chris Brown or white or men.
I think it looks pretty dope.

2720
02:19:31,460 --> 02:19:33,740
That out at me.
That looks like a Batmobile car.

2721
02:19:33,741 --> 02:19:37,100
If that was all the sudden matte
black, it's Phoenix Dillon's car. Yeah.

2722
02:19:38,150 --> 02:19:40,700
If I was a girl, I'd fuck you if
you had that car. All the, uh,

2723
02:19:40,850 --> 02:19:44,990
the charcoal matte gray ones.
Yeah, they're fucking gorgeous.

2724
02:19:45,070 --> 02:19:46,550
The charcoal mask gray is a dope.

2725
02:19:47,210 --> 02:19:50,570
That makes a lot of shapes look pretty
bad in America. You were raised,

2726
02:19:50,600 --> 02:19:53,120
you know like women are raised with the
sooner you're going to be a princess and

2727
02:19:53,121 --> 02:19:56,000
get married some day
program with that as a guy,

2728
02:19:56,240 --> 02:19:59,840
you know the Italian sports cars, you
know the, the posters on the wall, right?

2729
02:19:59,840 --> 02:20:03,490
Like it was always the, the Lambo and
the Ferrari and the Giardo getting,

2730
02:20:03,510 --> 02:20:05,840
when I first got that, it was wonderful
and I was fucking so appreciative.

2731
02:20:05,841 --> 02:20:07,040
But when I got the event door,

2732
02:20:07,460 --> 02:20:10,670
like it's the first night I just kind
of sat in there like when I, you know,

2733
02:20:10,671 --> 02:20:12,180
at the end of the night I just
went down and just sat in it.

2734
02:20:12,210 --> 02:20:14,870
My wife sitting there looking at me and
she's like, are you gonna fucking cry?

2735
02:20:15,310 --> 02:20:17,280
And I'm like, we ready to
cry. I was a little bit,

2736
02:20:17,510 --> 02:20:20,990
if a glimpse into the sensitive
part of cliffy Alma giant pussy,

2737
02:20:21,450 --> 02:20:24,490
you were about to cry cause
you achieve dreams. Yeah.

2738
02:20:24,491 --> 02:20:29,000
Did you cry in her arms and
just say babies maybe holding
be even worth anything?

2739
02:20:29,030 --> 02:20:30,590
I tell you what, dude, in
the grand scheme of things,

2740
02:20:30,591 --> 02:20:34,460
my Australian shepherd costs how much
lesson has given me so much more joy.

2741
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:38,510
So then your car? Yeah. Okay.
Not then your wife. Okay.

2742
02:20:38,511 --> 02:20:43,130
We were in the middle of that. Yeah. I
was like, how dare you sir. How dare you.

2743
02:20:43,320 --> 02:20:46,430
Oh God, no. That's a fucking
expensive Goddamn Carson.

2744
02:20:46,460 --> 02:20:50,630
That's like a half $1 million and that's
supposed to be just driving around and

2745
02:20:50,630 --> 02:20:53,090
a half a million dollar house.
It only has two seats.

2746
02:20:54,730 --> 02:20:59,510
It goes zero to 60 in three seconds. See
though, you should see the, the trunk.

2747
02:20:59,960 --> 02:21:03,470
Oh, is he actually find the boot? It's
hilarious. Can you put your Dick in there?

2748
02:21:04,260 --> 02:21:07,980
It was a big trunks. I put my bike
in it. Whoa. Well, no, I've easy.

2749
02:21:08,390 --> 02:21:11,000
Clearly a big bike.
Do you have a big car like that?

2750
02:21:11,001 --> 02:21:14,120
You obviously have to have
a small cock, so no, that's,

2751
02:21:14,420 --> 02:21:17,540
that's the people who don't have
that car wanted even want to think.

2752
02:21:17,570 --> 02:21:21,500
They want to think that there's gotta
be some way that not having that car is

2753
02:21:21,501 --> 02:21:23,270
better than having that car.
I knew a dude in Raleigh,

2754
02:21:23,271 --> 02:21:25,940
he had this gorgeous Red Maserati and a,

2755
02:21:25,941 --> 02:21:29,450
and he would always take it out
to the clubs and real and a EA.

2756
02:21:29,451 --> 02:21:31,970
One time dude had a Sunday
fun day and cops tail them.

2757
02:21:32,030 --> 02:21:35,180
He wrapped it around tree
fighting died and his wife,

2758
02:21:35,350 --> 02:21:38,950
his fiance was pregnant at the time. Oh
Jesus guys. Fucking, that's my thing.

2759
02:21:38,960 --> 02:21:41,120
That kind of, those, that kind of
thing, man. It's my silver reminder.

2760
02:21:41,121 --> 02:21:45,200
Like first off, don't fucking take the
car out to the club and second off, uh,

2761
02:21:45,440 --> 02:21:47,900
just be careful man. Yeah.
Don't drive like an asshole.

2762
02:21:47,930 --> 02:21:51,140
You can enjoy your car and not drive like
an asshole thing to do those cars do.

2763
02:21:51,141 --> 02:21:53,920
Did you go underneath an
overpass is to downshift. Yeah.

2764
02:21:53,930 --> 02:21:55,120
It's like a make fucking fighter.

2765
02:21:56,960 --> 02:22:00,480
Roll the window down and listen to the
noise and any car with a nice engine.

2766
02:22:00,490 --> 02:22:03,260
Yeah. That's my fear about the future,
man. I just, you got connected,

2767
02:22:03,261 --> 02:22:06,770
you have touch screens, you
have electronic cars, the
Teslas. Gorgeous. Right.

2768
02:22:06,771 --> 02:22:10,850
But it's laying noise. You want that
feedback, that room, you know? Yeah. Well,

2769
02:22:10,851 --> 02:22:12,950
that's the thing about the Mclaren,
like we were looking at the car.

2770
02:22:12,951 --> 02:22:16,690
It's absolutely beautiful but the sound
it makes is very uninspiring cause it's

2771
02:22:16,720 --> 02:22:20,360
turbocharged. It's like
turbo charged cars. They just
don't have that same sound.

2772
02:22:20,410 --> 02:22:23,010
You Watch after Paul
Walker died, the uh, the,

2773
02:22:23,011 --> 02:22:26,040
the top gear of the Porsche Carrera,
I

2774
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:27,700
saw the top gear a long time ago where

2775
02:22:29,330 --> 02:22:33,960
I took the stig all morning to get around
the fucking track once and that was a

2776
02:22:33,961 --> 02:22:37,080
gorgeous car to well it's
a very scary car. Yes.

2777
02:22:37,110 --> 02:22:40,440
It's not a car that's easy to handle that,
that mid engine design.

2778
02:22:40,441 --> 02:22:42,450
Extremely high horsepower,
very low weight.

2779
02:22:42,780 --> 02:22:45,720
There's a lot of room for
the tires to break loose.

2780
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:50,960
Like one of the things that like about
a Porsche or a BMW is one of the things

2781
02:22:51,631 --> 02:22:55,080
that are really good about is they're
really good about engineering their cars

2782
02:22:55,081 --> 02:22:58,800
so that the,
the car doesn't overwhelm the suspension.

2783
02:22:59,160 --> 02:23:03,060
Like even when these incredible cars they
have today, like the new nine 11 turbo,

2784
02:23:03,150 --> 02:23:08,040
the turbo ass go zero to 60 in 2.7
seconds. Yeah, it's insane. Yeah.

2785
02:23:08,041 --> 02:23:09,900
Dual clutch. That's all
they make. They don't,

2786
02:23:09,930 --> 02:23:11,910
they don't make you a manual
and the turbo anymore.

2787
02:23:11,940 --> 02:23:16,650
And they're saying zero to 60 time
honestly instantaneously. But they,

2788
02:23:16,680 --> 02:23:20,520
they don't let you even buy a
manual anymore. Yeah. And the,

2789
02:23:20,550 --> 02:23:23,010
the suspension is fucking staggering.

2790
02:23:23,130 --> 02:23:27,930
The back wheel steer now they
have steering back wheels
and the Porsche nine 11

2791
02:23:27,931 --> 02:23:31,020
turbo in on the gt three and the braking
power and you get to a super car like

2792
02:23:31,021 --> 02:23:32,130
that. So it's, for me,

2793
02:23:32,131 --> 02:23:36,720
it's like as a guy who knows nothing about
technology other than what I've read,

2794
02:23:36,721 --> 02:23:41,250
like I have zero skill or knowledge
or education in technology.

2795
02:23:41,490 --> 02:23:43,290
So when,
when I see stuff like this,

2796
02:23:43,450 --> 02:23:47,830
to me it's just like a totally new world,
a world of,

2797
02:23:47,850 --> 02:23:51,450
of fascination and accomplishment.
And what we're looking at it right now is,

2798
02:23:51,451 --> 02:23:53,820
is the roadster for the Aventador.
And here's again,

2799
02:23:53,821 --> 02:23:58,440
the problem is taking these
into the fucking panels off and,

2800
02:23:59,330 --> 02:24:01,300
and you've got to put them somewhere.
The actually the,

2801
02:24:01,301 --> 02:24:04,740
they actually will fit in the boot of
the car. Uh, but this guy's not doing it.

2802
02:24:05,130 --> 02:24:06,480
This guy looks like he's about to die too.

2803
02:24:06,840 --> 02:24:09,390
And that's what you look like when
you can afford an event a door,

2804
02:24:09,420 --> 02:24:14,370
either cliffy B or some dude who's
been working some slave job for Lehman

2805
02:24:14,371 --> 02:24:17,670
brothers your whole life and you're ready
to die and that's when you finally say

2806
02:24:17,940 --> 02:24:21,490
to your wife, fuck you bitch, I'm
buying this fucking car and she's has

2807
02:24:22,990 --> 02:24:25,350
think about guys who have to have
a man cave. I'm like, really?

2808
02:24:25,351 --> 02:24:27,770
You get one room in the
house? Wow. It's okay.

2809
02:24:27,810 --> 02:24:31,290
I can ask for sometimes cliffy be not
everybody can be like you. I'm cries.

2810
02:24:31,320 --> 02:24:34,490
A lot of people that they, they have to
settle for what they got or maybe they,

2811
02:24:34,530 --> 02:24:36,810
they're fucking over their head.
That's also possible.

2812
02:24:37,080 --> 02:24:40,600
Like a guy who's like a not very good
looking guy has a really good look and

2813
02:24:40,601 --> 02:24:44,420
girlfriend, who knows? She's
really good looking. So this
poor bastard, he can't go.

2814
02:24:44,421 --> 02:24:46,860
I'll cliffy be style and drive
around in the event a door.

2815
02:24:47,130 --> 02:24:50,400
He's got to play things real close to
the chest to try to keep this fucking,

2816
02:24:50,430 --> 02:24:54,210
it's like he wants to make sure
that she hasn't run fair enough.

2817
02:24:54,211 --> 02:24:56,010
What she's gotta do and
didn't call up the uh,

2818
02:24:56,011 --> 02:24:59,730
the roadster Aventador roadster
and pay him like a pale baby blue.

2819
02:24:59,790 --> 02:25:04,200
That's the wonderful car man.
Yeah. Aventador roadster. Roadster.

2820
02:25:04,201 --> 02:25:04,890
But look up uh,

2821
02:25:04,890 --> 02:25:09,090
like blue cause there's this like
metallic kind of almost Carolina blue that

2822
02:25:09,091 --> 02:25:12,870
just looks like it belongs it like in
Miami. Just crushing it. Just gorgeous.

2823
02:25:12,871 --> 02:25:16,320
That's my next target.
Aventador roadster. Yeah.

2824
02:25:16,710 --> 02:25:21,600
Now do you ever drive a cars with a
manual transmission? My Viper was,

2825
02:25:22,110 --> 02:25:25,570
that's my favorite there to drive.
Stick on. I learned to drive.

2826
02:25:25,571 --> 02:25:30,010
Stick on Tim Sweeney's a Lamborghini.
Even if you're not driving fast,

2827
02:25:30,011 --> 02:25:31,980
it's just more fun.
And the,

2828
02:25:31,981 --> 02:25:36,100
the thing about the Lamborghinis and
the Ferrari's is that gated shifter boy

2829
02:25:36,101 --> 02:25:39,910
that's going to be, that's going to be
like, people are going to miss that.

2830
02:25:39,970 --> 02:25:43,510
It's a click, click, click, click thought
a lot about die hard gear heads doing.

2831
02:25:43,540 --> 02:25:46,630
But I'm not going to front and say like,
I know a lot about the car.

2832
02:25:46,660 --> 02:25:49,030
Like I'm not like that.
I just didn't know it goes right.

2833
02:25:49,360 --> 02:25:50,770
I just love it cause it's just gorgeous.

2834
02:25:50,800 --> 02:25:54,250
Jon Lovitz let me drive his car way
back in the day when we're on news radio

2835
02:25:54,251 --> 02:25:57,880
together and he had a Ferrari
three, five, five and it was, uh,

2836
02:25:57,910 --> 02:26:01,660
the gated shifter and I, it
was a convertible too. And
I was driving, I was like,

2837
02:26:01,661 --> 02:26:04,870
this might be the coolest fucking car
I've ever been in in my life because the

2838
02:26:04,880 --> 02:26:09,450
sound was incredible. I was
like, this sound like makes
me feel better. It's like,

2839
02:26:09,590 --> 02:26:12,610
it's intoxicating. It really
is. Click, click, click, click.

2840
02:26:12,640 --> 02:26:16,570
It wasn't even about driving. It's
super fast. That's a McLaren roadster.

2841
02:26:17,440 --> 02:26:20,620
That's fucking dead. That's the, that's
the Aventador is it? Really? Yeah,

2842
02:26:22,480 --> 02:26:25,420
but uh, it's all shaky video. Why
is it so shaky? I know, right?

2843
02:26:25,630 --> 02:26:27,550
State still bitch get a better phone.

2844
02:26:27,970 --> 02:26:32,230
But the start button on the event door
has a little like red cap over it.

2845
02:26:32,231 --> 02:26:35,470
Like a fighter jet. You have to lift
it up and press the fucking button.

2846
02:26:35,590 --> 02:26:38,230
I love it. Everything's in Italian
as far as like, but you don't have,

2847
02:26:38,320 --> 02:26:41,590
it doesn't say gas or fields has
been Zena. Ooh. And it's just that.

2848
02:26:41,920 --> 02:26:43,420
And when I bring friends in the car,
I'm like,

2849
02:26:43,480 --> 02:26:46,900
would you like to do the
honors of pressing the fighter
jet button and it just,

2850
02:26:48,100 --> 02:26:48,680
you have to start,

2851
02:26:48,680 --> 02:26:52,060
you have to start it like once a week
or the bad or the battery doesn't charge

2852
02:26:52,061 --> 02:26:54,220
or whatever.
It's the alternator I think so.

2853
02:26:54,221 --> 02:26:56,560
Like if you don't have a plug
in your garage and you go wait,

2854
02:26:56,570 --> 02:27:00,340
start at once a week. If you don't run
it on an average once a week, it happens.

2855
02:27:00,360 --> 02:27:02,980
All supercars dude. Really?
Yeah, like for ours as well.

2856
02:27:02,981 --> 02:27:05,050
They'll just bricked and you've
got to kind of get a jump.

2857
02:27:05,530 --> 02:27:09,200
That sounds ridiculous. Yeah. Biggie was
right. More money. More problems. Yeah.

2858
02:27:09,700 --> 02:27:12,940
Well you could always put a trickle
charger on. I can't yet. He could. Yeah.

2859
02:27:12,941 --> 02:27:15,910
That's just probably your electronic
system is draining because it's made by

2860
02:27:15,911 --> 02:27:17,740
Italians.
Silly pitches.

2861
02:27:17,860 --> 02:27:22,390
If you've got to fucking one of those
Lexus LFA supercars those a half a million

2862
02:27:22,390 --> 02:27:24,160
dollar Lexuses. Have you seen those? Oh,

2863
02:27:24,161 --> 02:27:27,730
that's their attempt to make the first
supercar right. Did an amazing cars.

2864
02:27:27,740 --> 02:27:30,790
It's not that good looking. Yeah, exactly.
The look is just not feeling it. Well,

2865
02:27:30,820 --> 02:27:32,810
it's kind of ironic because it,

2866
02:27:32,840 --> 02:27:36,570
it's similar performance wise
to the Nissan Gtr and like,

2867
02:27:36,580 --> 02:27:38,680
it's like you look at the numbers,
they're very commensurate. Yeah.

2868
02:27:38,740 --> 02:27:41,890
And then it's like the,
if you look at the,

2869
02:27:41,891 --> 02:27:44,410
looks like it's not much
better looking than Nissan Gtr,

2870
02:27:44,620 --> 02:27:47,710
but then you look at the price and
it's like, it's a half a million.

2871
02:27:47,711 --> 02:27:51,650
The Nissan Gtrs I still have to import
the gtrs cause those were only making

2872
02:27:51,670 --> 02:27:54,550
them here. Now I got a couple
of buddies, they swear by them.

2873
02:27:54,551 --> 02:27:56,470
They're just great cars.
They're amazing cars.

2874
02:27:56,500 --> 02:27:59,720
Nissan GTR is one of the greatest cars
that people have ever designed and

2875
02:27:59,750 --> 02:28:03,490
created for some friends whose logic
people love the NSX also. I had one,

2876
02:28:03,530 --> 02:28:07,510
I had two of those actually. Yeah,
I uh, I had one, I got rid of it,

2877
02:28:07,511 --> 02:28:09,850
I got the Porsche,
the Porsche broke down like five times.

2878
02:28:09,851 --> 02:28:12,460
And then I've got another NSX and
that put a supercharger on it.

2879
02:28:12,490 --> 02:28:14,380
When I had the Aventador delivered,

2880
02:28:14,410 --> 02:28:17,410
it was the first one in North Carolina
and they only had the trailers for the

2881
02:28:17,411 --> 02:28:21,770
other types of cars and it got stuck in
the trailer and they couldn't get it out.

2882
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:23,570
And so the drivers didn't know what to do.

2883
02:28:23,571 --> 02:28:27,110
So I called my buddies a couple of big
boys and they basically got some dish

2884
02:28:27,111 --> 02:28:31,310
soap and were able to kind of pry the
car out by putting dish soap underneath

2885
02:28:31,311 --> 02:28:34,370
the tires after it pulled up and
pulled back cheese because it came from

2886
02:28:34,371 --> 02:28:37,440
Greensboro and it had like kind of
wedged itself in the trailer and that you

2887
02:28:37,441 --> 02:28:41,720
could, you couldn't do the Austin
Powers 15 point turn. Wow. They, yeah.

2888
02:28:41,721 --> 02:28:43,640
And actually won it with a couple
of little minor scratches on it,

2889
02:28:43,641 --> 02:28:44,660
which the dealers,
of course,

2890
02:28:44,661 --> 02:28:47,360
it's served me that when I
have it serviced I can put
it on a truck and ship it

2891
02:28:47,361 --> 02:28:49,700
to Greensboro. I had both of
them even need them surfaced.

2892
02:28:49,820 --> 02:28:54,260
The GTR is actually made at one factory
in Japan and they make them by hand.

2893
02:28:54,740 --> 02:28:58,820
And uh, apparently they lose money
on the car. Wow. Really? Yeah.

2894
02:28:59,810 --> 02:28:59,961
Well,

2895
02:28:59,961 --> 02:29:02,750
there's a how it's made for a Lamborghini
or dateline went behind the scenes and

2896
02:29:02,751 --> 02:29:05,450
how it was all made and it's all
dudes handmaking it the factory.

2897
02:29:05,451 --> 02:29:08,870
And for some reason all women doing this
dish of work and he just did the tour

2898
02:29:08,871 --> 02:29:10,100
of the factory.
That's how it should be.

2899
02:29:10,101 --> 02:29:11,540
They should be making sandwiches to cliff.

2900
02:29:11,541 --> 02:29:16,541
You'd be Joe that's misogynistic by
amine and he said by a blackbird instead

2901
02:29:16,820 --> 02:29:20,360
like a Yak. Blackbird. Yeah. Cause I
mean that's probably the same amount.

2902
02:29:20,400 --> 02:29:23,540
Like what are you talking
about? Those customers? Billion
Dollars. You knucklehead.

2903
02:29:24,050 --> 02:29:28,620
Those are like $1 billion at the
SR 71 yup. Yup. Deconditioned.

2904
02:29:29,090 --> 02:29:29,721
Yeah.
Yeah,

2905
02:29:29,721 --> 02:29:34,400
but you'd probably get a
used one transformers three
I think a Nissan GTR black

2906
02:29:34,401 --> 02:29:39,010
edition. $109,000 and it probably
feels just as fast as I fucking think.

2907
02:29:39,011 --> 02:29:42,950
Not really, but it's pretty goddamn
fast. Those cars are insanely fast.

2908
02:29:43,220 --> 02:29:47,000
I love sending my wife around town in
the white top down and people just lose

2909
02:29:47,001 --> 02:29:51,320
their shit. You love sending her
out there. She had cock holding.

2910
02:29:51,350 --> 02:29:55,370
So what's happening? What are you
saying? He likes sending her out there,

2911
02:29:56,340 --> 02:29:58,370
she's running errands. Just get all
that attention. He'll calm down.

2912
02:29:58,430 --> 02:30:02,750
You need to BRCA her up man. Keep her
up locked up in a castle somewhere.

2913
02:30:02,900 --> 02:30:03,360
Whatever.

2914
02:30:03,360 --> 02:30:05,900
What are the MMA fighters grabbed her
ass after the eyes when you were in

2915
02:30:05,901 --> 02:30:07,040
Charlotte.
That's shocking.

2916
02:30:07,041 --> 02:30:11,470
A cage fighter because I don't even
understand what you're saying and make it

2917
02:30:11,471 --> 02:30:13,760
sense man. Yeah, we're
willing to that bowling alley.

2918
02:30:13,761 --> 02:30:17,510
Lucky strike down there at the Charlotte.
Charlotte's a good towel man.

2919
02:30:17,511 --> 02:30:20,900
But it feels about his hip as the bankers
that built it really doesn't have a

2920
02:30:20,901 --> 02:30:22,900
lot of hard cause they built,
they've fucking destroyed it.

2921
02:30:22,900 --> 02:30:24,440
All the old buildings and
just rebuilt new shit.

2922
02:30:24,441 --> 02:30:25,640
So you feel like you're in the matrix.

2923
02:30:25,700 --> 02:30:29,870
So what is Raleigh as opposed
to Charlotte? Raleigh's
more down home or Ali's uh,

2924
02:30:30,140 --> 02:30:31,480
it's just,
you know,

2925
02:30:31,820 --> 02:30:34,700
a lot of the developers have embraced
the history and a lot of the restaurants,

2926
02:30:34,701 --> 02:30:36,830
you know, they leave the old brick.
They don't knock the whole thing down.

2927
02:30:36,831 --> 02:30:40,460
You know, we were talking about the,
uh, there's a bar right next to Charlie.

2928
02:30:40,461 --> 02:30:45,110
Good Nights, I guess. It's
actually downstairs from
Charlie goodnight's Rodeo bar.

2929
02:30:45,111 --> 02:30:47,650
They have like the fucking
mechanical bull and shaking, uh,

2930
02:30:47,720 --> 02:30:51,530
city limits and me and Ari and Brian,
were you there too?

2931
02:30:51,830 --> 02:30:56,600
I think in Eddie Bravo two we were there
doing standup and we went downstairs

2932
02:30:56,601 --> 02:31:00,200
and they were all singing along to this
song and we were all looking at each

2933
02:31:00,201 --> 02:31:02,710
other like, like, like
redneck woman or something.

2934
02:31:02,740 --> 02:31:07,010
It's like the scene in the dawn
of the dead where, um, you know,

2935
02:31:07,011 --> 02:31:09,210
like the guys in the
car and the zombies all,

2936
02:31:09,211 --> 02:31:13,160
all around and like he's the original
dawn of the dead and he's like, Holy Shit.

2937
02:31:13,161 --> 02:31:16,430
Like there's zombies everywhere
and they're just starting
to realize that that's

2938
02:31:16,431 --> 02:31:18,710
what it felt like when we're in this bar.
I guess we're,

2939
02:31:18,711 --> 02:31:22,110
we're by ourselves and then we hear the
song coming on and they don't know the

2940
02:31:22,111 --> 02:31:26,520
words at all, but everybody starts singing
along and they haven't got my pickup.

2941
02:31:27,580 --> 02:31:32,040
Why do you drink? Get
Drunk? No, no, no. It was,

2942
02:31:32,041 --> 02:31:36,600
it was not something that was popular. I
mean, it was popular for them, but it was,

2943
02:31:36,990 --> 02:31:39,890
these are people that I had no idea who
the fuck these people where they never,

2944
02:31:40,330 --> 02:31:43,560
we used to do bikini bull riding there.
They knew the summons though, man.

2945
02:31:43,960 --> 02:31:48,690
It was like, like top 10 country type
shit that they knew. And I was like, well,

2946
02:31:48,691 --> 02:31:51,120
this is like,
this is where the country audiences are.

2947
02:31:51,150 --> 02:31:54,210
A lot of the main countries. It's a
lot more rock than anything these days.

2948
02:31:54,211 --> 02:31:56,760
Like rascal Flatts, Keith urban
and it's, it's a little country,

2949
02:31:56,761 --> 02:32:01,470
but it's a lot of arena rock. Whereas
I'm saying just like Keith urban and uh,

2950
02:32:01,890 --> 02:32:05,490
and rascal Flatts and those kinds of
bands. Durban is like arena rock. Dude.

2951
02:32:05,491 --> 02:32:07,950
I went to a couple of his shows is
fucking fantastic. Yeah, look at that.

2952
02:32:07,951 --> 02:32:11,490
Brian Ebay. Oh, it's only a billion
dollars. That's just the tail rudder.

2953
02:32:12,240 --> 02:32:16,800
Oh my God. It's a tail rudder.
Yeah. That's all it is. And
it's sold for 1 million.

2954
02:32:16,830 --> 02:32:21,180
Oh, did it? Like was it from a plane that
crashed? Uh, let me get some historic,

2955
02:32:21,181 --> 02:32:23,020
yeah, it looks like a warehouse
in San Diego. I said the pride,

2956
02:32:23,030 --> 02:32:24,330
they didn't that day.
Oh my God.

2957
02:32:24,340 --> 02:32:27,700
Is some like Saudi prince is going to
buy that from making his coffee table.

2958
02:32:27,710 --> 02:32:31,440
He's going to jerk off on it every
day. That's what America, Jesus,

2959
02:32:32,640 --> 02:32:34,860
that's a weird thing to
buy for 1 million bucks.

2960
02:32:35,070 --> 02:32:38,400
I feel like you could do better
right by an oil platform.

2961
02:32:38,401 --> 02:32:41,490
Decommissioned one to start your
own country. That's not a bad move.

2962
02:32:41,940 --> 02:32:44,700
How much is an oil platform?
It doesn't work anymore. Um,

2963
02:32:44,880 --> 02:32:46,710
expensive but not as
expensive as you think.

2964
02:32:46,711 --> 02:32:48,420
I've read articles on it were really,
yeah.

2965
02:32:48,421 --> 02:32:51,090
People like you don't take the deep
mission and wanting to come to have their

2966
02:32:51,091 --> 02:32:55,510
own currency and make their own country.
There was an article on vice, uh,

2967
02:32:55,690 --> 02:32:59,190
it was a video. Yeah. Everything cool is,

2968
02:32:59,191 --> 02:33:01,200
there was a video on advice about,
um,

2969
02:33:01,230 --> 02:33:05,880
this woman who goes by the name
of neuro soup. Um, she was a,

2970
02:33:06,450 --> 02:33:08,180
she was a stripper and
then she got involved.

2971
02:33:08,190 --> 02:33:12,270
This guy who was an ecstasy dealer and
it's, it's a really crazy fucked up,

2972
02:33:12,271 --> 02:33:16,890
twisted tale involving murder and all
kinds of nutty shit and FBI and um,

2973
02:33:17,160 --> 02:33:22,110
she was living with this guy in a
fucking bomb shelter, not a bomb shelter,

2974
02:33:22,111 --> 02:33:23,970
but like a,
a missile silo.

2975
02:33:24,120 --> 02:33:29,120
They had converted a missile silo silo
into this like really beautiful high end

2976
02:33:29,521 --> 02:33:34,200
luxury house seats with it. Cause
it's multi tiered, right? Yeah. Yeah.

2977
02:33:34,201 --> 02:33:38,910
Something all underground. Yep. Missile
Silo here. I'll Google it. But um,

2978
02:33:38,940 --> 02:33:40,380
she uh,
you know,

2979
02:33:40,470 --> 02:33:44,270
she has this incredible story like the
got kidnapped her and like he was going

2980
02:33:44,271 --> 02:33:44,941
to kill them.

2981
02:33:44,941 --> 02:33:48,570
It's like the guy was just gacked out on
fucking drugs and he was selling drugs

2982
02:33:48,571 --> 02:33:52,320
and he was also like in cahoots with the
DEA or the FBI or something like that.

2983
02:33:52,321 --> 02:33:55,560
He was working under cover while he was
selling drugs. Yeah. Dude, if I have,

2984
02:33:55,650 --> 02:33:56,760
if I ever want to get anything done,

2985
02:33:56,761 --> 02:33:59,880
I don't go on a device like the Liberia
documentary they did about general buck

2986
02:33:59,881 --> 02:34:02,360
naked. Yeah. Cause you
remember he, that he made the,

2987
02:34:02,361 --> 02:34:05,640
the chemical sector and you pick a Mormon.
But he was a real fucking guy. Yeah,

2988
02:34:05,641 --> 02:34:08,910
he was. Yeah. That guy's
a scary fucking guy, man.

2989
02:34:08,940 --> 02:34:11,790
Now he's like a reformed and he's like
a preacher or something now. Well,

2990
02:34:11,791 --> 02:34:12,331
not only that,

2991
02:34:12,331 --> 02:34:16,080
he's killed thousands of people and
they absolve them of all of his murders

2992
02:34:16,081 --> 02:34:17,980
because he found Christ and he

2993
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:21,390
was talking openly on vice
about eating babies. Yeah.

2994
02:34:21,391 --> 02:34:24,490
And eating hearts to cutting the hearts
of the innocent children and drinking

2995
02:34:24,491 --> 02:34:27,720
their blood to make them victorious
in battle and their strength and shit.

2996
02:34:27,850 --> 02:34:31,210
Like whoa. And then they went into
North Korea at one point on vice,

2997
02:34:31,480 --> 02:34:35,350
like it's just nonstop, like
crazy shit. Yeah. This is a video.

2998
02:34:35,351 --> 02:34:38,350
The vice video is available online.

2999
02:34:38,351 --> 02:34:43,330
It's a Hamilton Morris is a Pharmacopia
Hamilton who's been on the podcast

3000
02:34:43,331 --> 02:34:45,010
before.
He did a video about it,

3001
02:34:45,011 --> 02:34:49,720
but there's an actual article that may
have not been on vice. That's about it.

3002
02:34:49,721 --> 02:34:52,210
So you've just do a little googling,
you'll find it.

3003
02:34:52,211 --> 02:34:55,300
But the story is absolutely
incredible thing is you're, you're,

3004
02:34:55,301 --> 02:34:59,350
you're crowd sourcing interesting stuff
through your Twitter verse. Yeah. Well,

3005
02:34:59,590 --> 02:35:03,220
they get you in touch with stuff that you
probably wouldn't find on your own and

3006
02:35:03,221 --> 02:35:06,760
in turn you get them in touch. It's
sorta like a relationship that you know,

3007
02:35:06,790 --> 02:35:10,980
bees pollinate things and you know
seeds eat a grapefruit, you take a shit,

3008
02:35:10,990 --> 02:35:13,930
the seeds go into the ground and they
grow grapefruit. Symbiotic. Yeah. This,

3009
02:35:13,931 --> 02:35:16,900
this symbiotic relationship that we
have with people on the Internet now,

3010
02:35:17,500 --> 02:35:21,340
if you exploit it correctly or you utilize
it correctly is a better way of using

3011
02:35:21,341 --> 02:35:24,610
it. It's incredibly rewarding to tweet
up anywhere a tweetup what's it? Yeah,

3012
02:35:24,611 --> 02:35:27,040
we just tweet. You're going to be
at the fucking mall on Thursday.

3013
02:35:27,100 --> 02:35:30,010
Good way to get touched.
Yeah. Fair enough. Net Buddy.

3014
02:35:30,060 --> 02:35:32,650
I'm not into that kind of shit. I know
what you're saying. I think you think,

3015
02:35:32,651 --> 02:35:34,680
oh Hollywood people are like
that. I see, right? Yeah.

3016
02:35:35,470 --> 02:35:36,760
What is it that girl said last night,

3017
02:35:36,761 --> 02:35:40,750
she's like trying to get you to fix her
hair. The wash. It's a good way to say it.

3018
02:35:40,840 --> 02:35:42,730
And then she's like, oh
yeah, I know. It's weird.

3019
02:35:42,731 --> 02:35:46,120
Nobody does this la or something
and like, okay, fix my hair.

3020
02:35:46,300 --> 02:35:48,880
Like the California thing.
Joe, go to the fucking salon.

3021
02:35:48,940 --> 02:35:52,670
Seriously touching your fucking greasy
hair. Weird pitch, but your lights,

3022
02:35:52,671 --> 02:35:53,504
your head lice.

3023
02:35:53,790 --> 02:35:56,540
My favorite California thing is whenever
you know someone's come from California,

3024
02:35:56,541 --> 02:35:59,630
because in the first 30 seconds they
tell you something incredibly intimate,

3025
02:35:59,890 --> 02:36:01,240
intimate about their life. Like, Oh yes,

3026
02:36:01,241 --> 02:36:04,030
I used to be addicted to drugs or
like I was molested and I'm like,

3027
02:36:04,420 --> 02:36:07,090
that's why they're here. Dog Burden me
with this shit. I don't want to know that

3028
02:36:07,240 --> 02:36:09,280
sad, but that's why they're here. Yeah.

3029
02:36:09,840 --> 02:36:12,400
You know it's weird
because this is also the,

3030
02:36:12,970 --> 02:36:16,120
obviously people create all over
the world, no doubt about that.

3031
02:36:16,121 --> 02:36:19,600
But when you come to like creating
things that get attention,

3032
02:36:19,630 --> 02:36:23,740
this is like the hub of the universe,
creating things that get attention.

3033
02:36:23,950 --> 02:36:26,830
It's almost all in Hollywood. It's like
a big chunk of it. Whether it's movies,

3034
02:36:26,831 --> 02:36:30,130
TV shows, Blah, blah, blah,
blah. Well who needs attention?

3035
02:36:30,370 --> 02:36:33,180
People that didn't get enough or people
that got too much of the wrong con. Yeah.

3036
02:36:33,220 --> 02:36:35,600
And those are the ones that seek
out and seek out validation.

3037
02:36:35,601 --> 02:36:37,990
So they all come here. It's so
weird. Mathematical process.

3038
02:36:38,090 --> 02:36:40,830
Oh, always loved Angelina, I
believe. Uh, he always left her.

3039
02:36:40,860 --> 02:36:43,710
Now the whole blonde bombshell just put
up fucking billboards of herself and

3040
02:36:43,730 --> 02:36:44,970
became famous just for that.

3041
02:36:45,180 --> 02:36:48,930
I saw her the other day just picking her
nose and eating it and then you posted

3042
02:36:48,931 --> 02:36:49,321
something about,

3043
02:36:49,321 --> 02:36:52,050
you saw somebody picking your nose
and eating it like the day after.

3044
02:36:52,051 --> 02:36:53,940
And I'm like, what the
fuck? That's hilarious.

3045
02:36:54,490 --> 02:36:56,640
I love that pink corvette veteran lady in

3046
02:36:56,640 --> 02:36:59,040
a wig.
She was a on the PCH.

3047
02:36:59,070 --> 02:37:02,480
The Topanga to the PCH on the merge
were stopped at the light and I looked

3048
02:37:02,481 --> 02:37:06,660
behind and I watched this old
lady in a wig just dig, pull out,

3049
02:37:06,661 --> 02:37:09,300
I'll whopper and just start chewing.
I mean,

3050
02:37:09,301 --> 02:37:13,680
she was openly chewing mouth
open chewing and I was like, wow.

3051
02:37:14,320 --> 02:37:16,160
And all I could think
of course for the rest

3052
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:16,941
of the day who that?

3053
02:37:16,941 --> 02:37:21,941
She probably came over here in 1955 and
she wanted it to be a star and she was

3054
02:37:22,821 --> 02:37:24,740
hot and it just didn't work out.

3055
02:37:24,741 --> 02:37:27,760
And now she's wearing a wig on the
PCH chewing or burgers and her,

3056
02:37:28,070 --> 02:37:32,800
her blue Saturn with fucking faded out
paint. It was very weird. Watch it.

3057
02:37:32,860 --> 02:37:36,130
I thought it was a touch. She always
drove a vet. Now that's Angelina. She did.

3058
02:37:36,150 --> 02:37:39,960
He saw Angelina. I saw some random
crazy lady with light blue Saturn.

3059
02:37:40,260 --> 02:37:43,220
I do that with people. I like try to piece
together what their story was. What's,

3060
02:37:43,221 --> 02:37:46,450
what's it. That fucking mind always
goes down to drugs and blow jobs.

3061
02:37:46,910 --> 02:37:50,390
The stories all of very
unoriginal. They always, you know,

3062
02:37:50,391 --> 02:37:54,020
somewhere along the line someone blew Burt
Reynolds. That's always in my stories.

3063
02:37:54,920 --> 02:37:58,640
What's that fucking water that they're
advertising all over la one 38 or

3064
02:37:58,641 --> 02:38:00,470
something.
They just like billboards.

3065
02:38:00,471 --> 02:38:03,050
It's just like hot hot chicks and some
bottled water. I didn't have enough.

3066
02:38:03,051 --> 02:38:06,680
It's like a banks I think
thing or something. Are you
serious? I haven't seen it.

3067
02:38:06,920 --> 02:38:07,461
And then the pop,

3068
02:38:07,461 --> 02:38:11,530
the bubble head renders on the bus
benches also with an la proper and it's

3069
02:38:11,550 --> 02:38:16,370
bottled water. Sexy water is the best
water. You don't even drink at Vons, bro.

3070
02:38:16,400 --> 02:38:18,640
Terrible for the environment,
but bottled water is,

3071
02:38:18,641 --> 02:38:23,150
somebody showed me a photo of a place in
La that just serves water like and like

3072
02:38:23,151 --> 02:38:26,770
you pick your water and they described
the spring that it's from. I'm like, oh,

3073
02:38:26,780 --> 02:38:30,620
those guys are assholes. Elling so
hard right now. That's not true.

3074
02:38:30,621 --> 02:38:34,390
That's gotta be a parody. Tim and
Eric Shit. Yeah. What's your color?

3075
02:38:34,450 --> 02:38:38,300
[inaudible] water. Clairvoyants
wait a minute. Cool. Blue Quill.

3076
02:38:38,330 --> 02:38:39,830
Clairvoyants what?

3077
02:38:39,840 --> 02:38:43,880
Why does it say clairvoyants you trying
to tell me that I could read minds with

3078
02:38:43,881 --> 02:38:47,180
your fucking, I think that's what it
is. It's the bottle is different colors.

3079
02:38:47,181 --> 02:38:51,260
So you just, what does it say? That's the
color of that. What does that one say?

3080
02:38:51,261 --> 02:38:53,420
Fuck. Vitamin water. Well
that one says clairvoyance to,

3081
02:38:53,421 --> 02:38:57,380
they all say clairvoyants look everyone
you click on and what does it say?

3082
02:38:57,381 --> 02:39:00,620
Also sexy something. What? Sexy.
What does it say in the middle?

3083
02:39:00,720 --> 02:39:05,690
She's as you scroll and Freak.
Hold it in place. Oh my God.

3084
02:39:05,720 --> 02:39:08,620
Where are you going up? The
actual thing, the logo itself,

3085
02:39:08,630 --> 02:39:12,380
it's like he's in a connect, bossy black
and what's below that? Clairvoyance.

3086
02:39:12,530 --> 02:39:15,870
But it was say it said sexy. One
of them was sexy. Something like,

3087
02:39:15,890 --> 02:39:19,580
that's one of the colors.
Placebo. Water. Come on,

3088
02:39:19,581 --> 02:39:22,880
you're telling me your water sexy.
You fuck that shit will drown you.

3089
02:39:23,280 --> 02:39:24,260
Sexy Sunshine,

3090
02:39:24,261 --> 02:39:26,870
yellow a waterboard you and find
out what you terrorist information.

3091
02:39:26,871 --> 02:39:28,040
The first fashion water,

3092
02:39:28,390 --> 02:39:31,840
we'll find out which one is sexy so I
can make sure I never fucking drink it

3093
02:39:31,841 --> 02:39:35,360
ever again. Sexy, sexy red. Fuck you.

3094
02:39:35,390 --> 02:39:38,720
How about that one 38 water.
Sexy read you.

3095
02:39:38,810 --> 02:39:42,140
You silly bitches are giving them a plug.
That's your name.

3096
02:39:42,141 --> 02:39:46,640
You come for the water. Sexy
red. Fuck you. How dare you.

3097
02:39:47,590 --> 02:39:51,740
I dare you treat me like I'm not stupid
plant man. I just wish I had some sex.

3098
02:39:52,040 --> 02:39:54,290
Can't get any sex, dude.
Nobody wants to give me no sex,

3099
02:39:54,320 --> 02:39:58,010
but it didn't go by some sexy red water.
Is She a part of this? She's drinking.

3100
02:39:58,020 --> 02:40:01,690
It's like I take it back. She was very
pretty. My Buddy's dating seems nice.

3101
02:40:02,060 --> 02:40:04,670
She's a sweetheart and don't
drop names on my podcast anymore.

3102
02:40:04,671 --> 02:40:08,280
It's making me uncomfortable.
Then your buddy. Okay.

3103
02:40:09,040 --> 02:40:13,260
I was trying to be what? It's Dana.
Really? Yeah. She's just fucking cool.

3104
02:40:13,261 --> 02:40:14,880
So have you seen them together?
Yes.

3105
02:40:15,560 --> 02:40:18,300
I'm sure he's not paying her because
if I was a girl like Adrian Currie,

3106
02:40:18,301 --> 02:40:21,450
what I would do is I would start a
service to make people look cool.

3107
02:40:21,480 --> 02:40:25,710
I would just hang out with them. So I'd
say I'm just dating dating this guy.

3108
02:40:25,711 --> 02:40:29,940
Now that doesn't make any sense a fair
enough. It doesn't make any sense.

3109
02:40:29,941 --> 02:40:31,250
It's not fair enough.
I'm just showing you.

3110
02:40:31,300 --> 02:40:34,080
I mentioned that cause
it's like if somebody had a
problem with her and be like,

3111
02:40:34,081 --> 02:40:35,250
well I knew her.
Just don't be mean.

3112
02:40:35,910 --> 02:40:39,780
Oh you were defending her without
her being attacked. That's beautiful.

3113
02:40:40,890 --> 02:40:44,160
I'm a white knight knighting.
Get advanced fucking Internet.

3114
02:40:44,190 --> 02:40:45,930
You're getting a white knight in advance.

3115
02:40:45,960 --> 02:40:47,730
That is one of the grossest
things about the internet.

3116
02:40:47,731 --> 02:40:50,940
Is it not the White Knight?
What's the White Knight?

3117
02:40:50,970 --> 02:40:53,730
The white knight is a chest movie
from the 80s it's the guy who's like,

3118
02:40:53,731 --> 02:40:56,700
oh guys are being misogynistic to you.
I'm going to come in and save you. Yeah.

3119
02:40:56,730 --> 02:40:58,830
They always want to assure you
that there are different to them.

3120
02:40:58,860 --> 02:41:03,160
All the other men, there's other men out
there are assholes. So here's just a,

3121
02:41:03,180 --> 02:41:06,990
an acquaintance of mine started a website
called fat ugly or slutty.com and so

3122
02:41:06,991 --> 02:41:09,630
the idea is if you're playing an online
video game and you're actually a female,

3123
02:41:09,690 --> 02:41:12,130
they assume you're either
fat, ugly or slutty. Well,

3124
02:41:12,170 --> 02:41:15,810
it's a weird thing where people like
want to profess the fact that they don't

3125
02:41:15,811 --> 02:41:19,560
hate women. Like they'll have it in
their Twitter handle. Don't hate women,

3126
02:41:19,561 --> 02:41:22,650
you know,
I don't hate women like Duh,

3127
02:41:23,070 --> 02:41:25,080
like how many people do like is it,

3128
02:41:25,320 --> 02:41:30,030
isn't it like more likely less people
hate women than more people hit women?

3129
02:41:30,060 --> 02:41:33,120
The fact that you have to actually say
that, it seems like what are, what are,

3130
02:41:33,121 --> 02:41:35,940
what numbers are we working
with? Like, I mean is it what,

3131
02:41:35,941 --> 02:41:38,640
what a percentage of people hate women?
Is it even won?

3132
02:41:38,670 --> 02:41:42,870
The thing about women in the video game
industry is having personally known many

3133
02:41:42,871 --> 02:41:46,050
of them. The stories I fucking hear
from them are fucking horrifying.

3134
02:41:46,500 --> 02:41:49,470
Like what do you mean? Like, as far
as like harass me, all that shit.

3135
02:41:49,590 --> 02:41:52,380
Of course they're working with men,
men, soc, but that's not my point.

3136
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:56,490
My random dude's living presence on
their desk. Anonymous Lean Shit. Ooh,

3137
02:41:56,491 --> 02:41:57,210
that's creepy.

3138
02:41:57,210 --> 02:41:59,790
Especially you take that home and that
presence got a remote control camera.

3139
02:41:59,850 --> 02:42:03,480
Yeah, exactly. Oh, it's, hey, I need my
little nanny bear. You have the GPS. Yeah.

3140
02:42:03,510 --> 02:42:04,980
Well let's, that had
that, the hacking of, uh,

3141
02:42:05,010 --> 02:42:07,380
people's webcams and then
demanding that they, you know,

3142
02:42:07,500 --> 02:42:10,100
they find a couple of naked pictures
and they demand that the girl gives them

3143
02:42:10,101 --> 02:42:12,360
more. They recently posted a
guy for that. Oh, of course.

3144
02:42:12,361 --> 02:42:14,880
There's always going to be a guy that
fucks everything up for everybody else.

3145
02:42:15,930 --> 02:42:19,170
There's always going to be one douchey
dude does shitty things. And if,

3146
02:42:19,171 --> 02:42:21,870
especially if you could do it anonymously
and an office like that and just creep

3147
02:42:21,871 --> 02:42:25,740
her out. Yup. But they could find that
they could fight. They have cameras.

3148
02:42:25,741 --> 02:42:29,610
They could figure out who the fuck's
doing that. Yeah. It's, uh, I dunno.

3149
02:42:29,670 --> 02:42:32,850
I haven't had my feet in those shoes.
You have the same issue though.

3150
02:42:32,851 --> 02:42:35,720
If you a twink like yourself,
if you were a involved in a play,

3151
02:42:35,730 --> 02:42:37,320
I'm actually a puff a man.
I'm actually power bottom.

3152
02:42:38,790 --> 02:42:41,970
But if you were involved in a company
with a bunch of like really aggressive,

3153
02:42:41,971 --> 02:42:46,350
large gay men, it's like a big
bunch of linebackers who, you know,

3154
02:42:46,590 --> 02:42:50,320
just also were gay and they started a
company and they employed you. Yeah,

3155
02:42:50,430 --> 02:42:52,680
that'd be even more threatened.
I wouldn't fare well in prison.

3156
02:42:53,640 --> 02:42:56,670
I'd have koolaid and my lips and the
first spot. Great way of describing it.

3157
02:42:56,820 --> 02:42:58,920
I wouldn't fair, well,
I have a pretty mouth.

3158
02:43:01,290 --> 02:43:03,390
I wouldn't fair,
well that's not like pirate talk.

3159
02:43:03,450 --> 02:43:06,480
I wouldn't fare well and that's
scary to me. It would be acting up.

3160
02:43:06,620 --> 02:43:10,170
He would get me with the cooks need to
get to my citrus. What was that accent?

3161
02:43:11,020 --> 02:43:11,980
Yeah.
Being pursued is

3162
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:16,420
not fun. Whether it's an unwanted,
whether you're a man or a woman,

3163
02:43:16,600 --> 02:43:19,990
but it's way creepier if you're a woman
because men are physically larger,

3164
02:43:20,560 --> 02:43:24,580
physically larger, usually, and more
violent and creepier. Yeah. You know,

3165
02:43:24,581 --> 02:43:27,790
like everybody wanted to get scared
because of the movie, like, um,

3166
02:43:28,120 --> 02:43:31,660
like fatal attraction. The bunny burner.
You know, she's boiling bunnies and shit.

3167
02:43:31,880 --> 02:43:33,580
He just wants to kill him.
He has to kill her at the end.

3168
02:43:33,790 --> 02:43:37,870
But for women that's like par
for the course, you know, that's,

3169
02:43:38,190 --> 02:43:41,860
it's way more common, but it just
doesn't manifest itself in movies.

3170
02:43:41,861 --> 02:43:44,950
It's fucking cat calls. That's the
thing. It just like, is that ever worked?

3171
02:43:45,220 --> 02:43:48,970
I saw that happen to my dad, my Stepdad
when I was a kid in San Francisco,

3172
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:52,090
I saw some guy whistle at
him while he's with me. Man,

3173
02:43:52,450 --> 02:43:57,050
I was fucking seven and saw some
guy who was walking, he's whatever.

3174
02:43:57,400 --> 02:44:01,870
How did that get universal to buy the
right? That's like, okay, okay. Is Global.

3175
02:44:01,920 --> 02:44:05,470
Yeah, you can eat right. Most random
country and say, okay, okay, okay, okay.

3176
02:44:05,680 --> 02:44:08,280
And everyone fucking knows
it. Yeah. But it's like,

3177
02:44:08,290 --> 02:44:12,040
you see videos is most third world nation
and inevitably there's Coca Cola there.

3178
02:44:12,250 --> 02:44:14,980
I wonder who came up with check about bow,
uh,

3179
02:44:16,200 --> 02:44:19,960
came from the original, like it used
to be the classic porn style. Right.

3180
02:44:19,961 --> 02:44:24,961
But that sound though is like all you
have to do is go bounce when someone walks

3181
02:44:25,481 --> 02:44:29,020
by. And that very specific,
right? It's pretty much,

3182
02:44:29,080 --> 02:44:32,410
that maybe varies a little
bit like bowel wall mount,

3183
02:44:34,570 --> 02:44:35,680
but you could say that,

3184
02:44:35,681 --> 02:44:37,780
but you're a little bit more
sophisticated to the average person.

3185
02:44:38,860 --> 02:44:42,880
The average person
has midi keyboard.

3186
02:44:43,050 --> 02:44:45,610
The average person that saw like,
you know,

3187
02:44:45,670 --> 02:44:47,290
two people that are like holding hands,

3188
02:44:47,291 --> 02:44:48,810
they start making out and
you look at them, you go,

3189
02:44:49,360 --> 02:44:54,070
I'll watch a compound bow automatically
brown chicken cow. Cow. Yeah.

3190
02:44:54,071 --> 02:44:56,980
What is that and how did that one
make it through? It's cultural.

3191
02:44:56,981 --> 02:44:59,320
You can't map it,
but it's fascinating.

3192
02:44:59,710 --> 02:45:03,130
Everyone is saying literally
amazing about everything now.

3193
02:45:03,370 --> 02:45:05,700
I don't hang out with those people,
man. All right, fair enough. Checking.

3194
02:45:05,780 --> 02:45:07,930
You know what everybody is saying though,
you know,

3195
02:45:08,200 --> 02:45:09,760
and I do it too and a fucking hate it.

3196
02:45:09,910 --> 02:45:12,820
I was listening for it the other day in
an interview. I heard like a hundred,

3197
02:45:12,821 --> 02:45:16,720
you know, in one conversation
it's the new, uh, and I do it.

3198
02:45:16,721 --> 02:45:20,380
I'm trying to avoid doing it. It's hard
when you know you're trying to, you know,

3199
02:45:20,381 --> 02:45:24,540
trying to, you know, figure out what the
fuck you're going to say. Oh, he goes,

3200
02:45:24,710 --> 02:45:26,770
I hate listening to myself.
I hate fucking watching myself.

3201
02:45:26,771 --> 02:45:29,890
The problem with it though is once you're
aware of it, you can't not think of,

3202
02:45:29,891 --> 02:45:31,650
you knows, it's like you, you know,

3203
02:45:31,651 --> 02:45:35,110
it was just permeate your brain and you
can't listen to a conversation cause

3204
02:45:35,111 --> 02:45:38,590
he's like, you want to interrupt and say,
don't say you know, again, don't do it.

3205
02:45:38,950 --> 02:45:41,370
But they're gonna say it again. I'll call
people out on the literally thing. Oh,

3206
02:45:41,380 --> 02:45:43,750
if your friends, you'd be like, I'm
literally dying here. I'm like, really?

3207
02:45:43,751 --> 02:45:46,600
You actually fit? Do I need to get to the
fucking er? Like what's going on? Yeah.

3208
02:45:46,601 --> 02:45:48,960
The misuse of the word literary,
they actually changed.

3209
02:45:48,961 --> 02:45:52,770
Literally they changed the
definition of it. Yeah. Really? Yeah.

3210
02:45:52,771 --> 02:45:55,120
So it basically means that the
Oxford dictionary, whatever.

3211
02:45:55,121 --> 02:45:58,570
So that essentially means figuratively.
Sure. It's not the urban dictionary, Dude.

3212
02:45:58,960 --> 02:46:02,470
I don't if Ahca did. They really?
Dude, urban dictionary man.

3213
02:46:02,560 --> 02:46:06,130
90% that shit's made up. Well,
if you want to keep a job,

3214
02:46:06,160 --> 02:46:10,040
you will make up some urban expressions,
son. We got books to, Yup. We got

3215
02:46:10,130 --> 02:46:12,350
people that outfit.
Well that's like private prisons.

3216
02:46:12,351 --> 02:46:15,230
Once there's money involved in
it, it just goes, gets crazy.

3217
02:46:15,250 --> 02:46:19,940
You just bow chicka wow. Wow. A verbal
means referencing a sexual encounter,

3218
02:46:19,941 --> 02:46:24,050
act or deed. Also used to identify
someone or thing that is sexual. Hmm.

3219
02:46:24,440 --> 02:46:28,760
I got this girl at the club and
bounce your, wow. Wow. That guy.

3220
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,250
That guy has sort of dazzled shirt.
Yeah.

3221
02:46:31,310 --> 02:46:34,310
He's probably got one of those ones
that has like Japanese writing in foil,

3222
02:46:35,120 --> 02:46:38,870
you know those affliction ones with
a tight v neck. Mike, Mike Posner,

3223
02:46:38,871 --> 02:46:40,790
the guy that wrote that song.

3224
02:46:40,820 --> 02:46:44,820
If I can write you a song like
he has a song called Bow Chico.

3225
02:46:44,830 --> 02:46:49,790
How well does he really? Yeah, it's
clever bastard and I saw him alive.

3226
02:46:49,850 --> 02:46:53,180
I like him recently. He was
good. Yeah. He's actually from a,

3227
02:46:53,470 --> 02:46:58,130
he was going to Duke when he started
his music career. Thank right graduate.

3228
02:46:58,370 --> 02:47:00,220
So he's having a call with a zero.

3229
02:47:03,730 --> 02:47:04,563
Yes.

3230
02:47:10,020 --> 02:47:12,510
Production values kind
of art music factory.

3231
02:47:15,280 --> 02:47:17,100
You got gas.
Shut this off immediately

3232
02:47:18,720 --> 02:47:21,680
do to America. Do you hate America?
Are you with the terrorists?

3233
02:47:21,710 --> 02:47:25,710
I'm opposing her fan. Uh, he opened
for what? Kesha, you can't really,

3234
02:47:26,250 --> 02:47:28,980
you can't really judge the
guy based on the 10 seconds.

3235
02:47:29,070 --> 02:47:34,070
A very stressful spraying and
nonsense to the air can match.

3236
02:47:34,241 --> 02:47:38,680
He just asked you to rent.
Yeah. Axe Body spray him buddy.

3237
02:47:38,740 --> 02:47:42,060
Chuck car or used car just went away on
its own. It's sort of like the plague.

3238
02:47:42,080 --> 02:47:43,680
How are I'm bringing it back
or are you bringing back?

3239
02:47:43,920 --> 02:47:46,560
I used to bathe in that shit
in high school. I bet you did.

3240
02:47:46,580 --> 02:47:49,500
Oh you son of a bitch will do it. Staring
at your poster of your Lamborghini.

3241
02:47:49,700 --> 02:47:53,550
Yeah. One day world. One of these
days. Show you all shallow. Yeah.

3242
02:47:55,850 --> 02:47:56,060
Going to

3243
02:47:56,060 --> 02:47:58,900
be a mega villain. Yeah. How did
you guys wind up in North Carolina?

3244
02:47:58,901 --> 02:48:01,990
Was that just where one
of the main epic guys, uh,

3245
02:48:02,020 --> 02:48:05,800
was working for IBM and he said,
hey, come check it out. And if,

3246
02:48:05,820 --> 02:48:09,970
if I was the person I am today
and I moved to Raleigh in 1998,

3247
02:48:09,971 --> 02:48:11,470
I'd be fucking miserable.
Why is that?

3248
02:48:11,530 --> 02:48:14,160
Because back then all I cared about was
that there was a fucking mall and at

3249
02:48:14,161 --> 02:48:17,290
Burger King and now you're more cultured,
your different guy.

3250
02:48:17,291 --> 02:48:22,090
Now I'm farm to table Joe Farm to table
all you organic. I it, no, fuck no.

3251
02:48:22,180 --> 02:48:26,140
We're not a free gluten free and organic.
No, it's a no. Just, you know, I don't,

3252
02:48:26,141 --> 02:48:29,380
I'm kind of over the big, big
chains and shit. Yeah. I'm like,

3253
02:48:29,410 --> 02:48:31,600
well this is nice when you go to places
like Seattle where you don't see too

3254
02:48:31,601 --> 02:48:32,670
many chains.
Yeah.

3255
02:48:32,890 --> 02:48:36,100
Seattle's a cool town in that
there's a lot of individual cities,

3256
02:48:36,400 --> 02:48:39,580
a lot of places that you know, are you
individual rather restaurants that are,

3257
02:48:39,680 --> 02:48:42,900
you know, locally owned, locally
operated like that pit place. Yeah.

3258
02:48:42,940 --> 02:48:45,850
Well that's a change. You
don't want to go, let's go,

3259
02:48:45,851 --> 02:48:48,070
let's go to fucking this place and
go to Chili's. Like what the fuck?

3260
02:48:48,310 --> 02:48:49,570
Those places have personality,

3261
02:48:49,571 --> 02:48:51,820
like places that are
individually owned and operated.

3262
02:48:51,821 --> 02:48:54,610
They have a certain personality that you
never going to get at a TGI Friday's.

3263
02:48:54,640 --> 02:48:57,990
Exactly. When the menus to let
laminated and just a little too slick.

3264
02:48:57,991 --> 02:49:01,120
You just think that there's anything wrong
with the Fridays, you know, or Chili's.

3265
02:49:01,121 --> 02:49:05,590
You want some baby back rings, wings,
whatever. Those fucking commercials,

3266
02:49:06,300 --> 02:49:09,450
baby back bad if you're on the road.

3267
02:49:09,451 --> 02:49:12,720
I had a buddy my visit from la a couple
months ago and I took him to my friends,

3268
02:49:12,990 --> 02:49:15,390
a establishment. He says, dude, what
do you think of Raleigh? And he goes,

3269
02:49:15,391 --> 02:49:16,500
it's great.
There's no chains.

3270
02:49:16,590 --> 02:49:18,540
I told you is what the terrorists
you here I was friends talk,

3271
02:49:19,590 --> 02:49:21,060
he's going to do think of Raleigh.
He's Raleigh.

3272
02:49:21,180 --> 02:49:24,090
You know he's Moroccan
and he uses the word dude.

3273
02:49:24,091 --> 02:49:29,070
All it is this Tila Tequila converts
and Nazi-ism Tila Tequila would suck

3274
02:49:29,071 --> 02:49:34,050
Satan's Dick if it got
her on TV. Tila, Tequila,

3275
02:49:34,051 --> 02:49:38,010
it converts. Hold on, pull down it
down, read it, converts the Nazis.

3276
02:49:38,011 --> 02:49:39,060
I'm calls herself,

3277
02:49:39,660 --> 02:49:44,370
hit Dilla and antisemetic
new song had Tila

3278
02:49:47,390 --> 02:49:49,470
fucking retard. Come on. It's that real.

3279
02:49:50,670 --> 02:49:53,970
She's trying so hard and she
still runs her heart. Hey man,

3280
02:49:54,030 --> 02:49:57,810
we're talking about her shit, right?
The Kardashians factor, right.

3281
02:49:58,530 --> 02:49:59,850
She trolled us.
Lawrence,

3282
02:49:59,851 --> 02:50:02,190
19 year old sister was talking about
watching that show and she had,

3283
02:50:02,191 --> 02:50:05,010
she didn't know that Kim
Kardashian had a sex tape. Oh,

3284
02:50:05,310 --> 02:50:10,300
well did it make her feel better about
the show or worse? She didn't really care.

3285
02:50:10,301 --> 02:50:13,670
A sex tape. Sex. That's something
like one of the best ones he liked.

3286
02:50:13,830 --> 02:50:16,860
Big Black Cock gets it. Be
Honest. She tunes into the beach,

3287
02:50:16,861 --> 02:50:17,910
she tunes into the BBC.

3288
02:50:19,170 --> 02:50:21,600
There will be a time when mark my
words in the future where like,

3289
02:50:21,601 --> 02:50:25,080
it's like you don't have a
sex tape. What's wrong with
you? Check mine out cliff.

3290
02:50:25,100 --> 02:50:27,840
He's saying this because he's about to
release a sex tape. I'm going to leak it.

3291
02:50:28,350 --> 02:50:30,840
You're going to accidentally leak
at accidentally leaking. Yeah.

3292
02:50:30,841 --> 02:50:33,570
She's one of the first that actually
got hugely famous though from it.

3293
02:50:33,571 --> 02:50:38,370
I mean Paris Hilton got sort of
famous from that boring, but yeah,

3294
02:50:38,371 --> 02:50:41,460
hers was annoying when she was blowing
that guy and kept answering the phone.

3295
02:50:42,840 --> 02:50:46,620
Fucking rude etiquette through terrible
blow job advocate can all learn from

3296
02:50:46,621 --> 02:50:47,870
that to your way of saying this,

3297
02:50:48,060 --> 02:50:50,190
my phone and my phone calls are
more important than your cock,

3298
02:50:50,220 --> 02:50:52,590
but she's basically like the
Floyd Mayweather reality stars.

3299
02:50:52,591 --> 02:50:54,270
You're tuning because you hate her.
You know?

3300
02:50:54,390 --> 02:50:55,920
She figured out how to market in that way,

3301
02:50:56,190 --> 02:50:59,550
become obnoxious in a way that
people will tune in just to hate her,

3302
02:50:59,760 --> 02:51:03,090
but they got tired of that after awhile.
She didn't fucking up big black guys

3303
02:51:04,740 --> 02:51:08,250
that show with Nicole Richie. That was
like, I just hate both of those girls now.

3304
02:51:08,251 --> 02:51:11,280
Where's in the call? Richie? You don't
really ever hear about her. She still is.

3305
02:51:11,281 --> 02:51:11,721
She's got it.

3306
02:51:11,721 --> 02:51:14,250
She's got millions of followers on
fucking Twitter thinks she's got kids now.

3307
02:51:14,280 --> 02:51:16,890
It's just out of the loop don with it all.
Oh,

3308
02:51:16,891 --> 02:51:20,460
you either stay in the party group
and die or become a family person.

3309
02:51:20,640 --> 02:51:24,090
That sounds like you should put that in
the beginning of a new video party or

3310
02:51:24,091 --> 02:51:27,960
die. This is a new video. You coop
and does all the rockers, right?

3311
02:51:27,990 --> 02:51:31,830
They're either die or they become
family men. Yeah. Or they become like,

3312
02:51:31,860 --> 02:51:35,640
I watched gene Simmons family jewels.
It's now it's on access TV.

3313
02:51:36,910 --> 02:51:39,990
It's not so crazy that miss
fakers show ever. It's weird.

3314
02:51:40,180 --> 02:51:42,770
You see the one where he,
I think we talked about where he uh,

3315
02:51:42,780 --> 02:51:47,780
got vibrators glued to his hands and he
had to go out and he couldn't take these

3316
02:51:47,971 --> 02:51:50,670
vibrators off cause somebody's super
glued them to his hands somehow.

3317
02:51:50,730 --> 02:51:53,850
It's weird because I was a huge kiss fan,
you know?

3318
02:51:53,851 --> 02:51:57,360
And so now I'm watching him
and he's just weird, you know,

3319
02:51:57,390 --> 02:52:02,070
older guy on a fake show. It's
like, but, but your gene Simmons,

3320
02:52:02,400 --> 02:52:06,250
you're like, you know your Gene
Simmons, what are you doing here?

3321
02:52:06,251 --> 02:52:10,660
What's going on here? You're
got a thunder. He probably
sees it as this marketing.

3322
02:52:11,010 --> 02:52:14,830
Yeah, I'm sure they came to town and
they still did a fucking good show.

3323
02:52:14,831 --> 02:52:17,830
Of course. Then I realized, fuck yeah,
half the members are like new dudes.

3324
02:52:18,010 --> 02:52:21,800
Two of them. Half of. Exactly. But my
wife had no idea what she was enforced.

3325
02:52:21,850 --> 02:52:26,080
She's like, what the fuck? Where the same
thing. And we just went and saw guar.

3326
02:52:26,470 --> 02:52:28,390
Oh my God.
I told her nothing.

3327
02:52:31,570 --> 02:52:32,830
What's the main dude goes?

3328
02:52:32,890 --> 02:52:37,000
Drink by bloody see made as his cuddle
for sprays into the crowd. She's like,

3329
02:52:37,570 --> 02:52:42,310
the fuck are you? That is rude. It's
bloody Sieman's crew open for kiss.

3330
02:52:42,760 --> 02:52:47,050
Really crude crude at crew wasn't doing
so good, man. They were. Vince was like,

3331
02:52:47,290 --> 02:52:52,240
he's the way that feeling. All right.
I got Mick Mars like propped up.

3332
02:52:52,750 --> 02:52:56,740
Oh Wow. Dude. That was like growing
up and listening to all that music.

3333
02:52:56,741 --> 02:52:59,740
The sunset strip was like
this fucking mythical place.

3334
02:53:00,070 --> 02:53:03,490
Right where giant girls
hair fucking aquanet.

3335
02:53:03,590 --> 02:53:06,520
You know comedians too,
man. Yeah. There's sunsets.

3336
02:53:06,521 --> 02:53:09,220
Trip has been a mythical place
for a long ass time. Yeah.

3337
02:53:09,370 --> 02:53:12,250
I still haven't seen that
documentary on the sunset strip.

3338
02:53:12,251 --> 02:53:14,520
It's supposed to be incredible.
We're trying to get it mattes.

3339
02:53:14,521 --> 02:53:18,310
Tags is trying to get a copy of it
for the, can you get it on iTunes?

3340
02:53:18,340 --> 02:53:22,390
The documentary, not the showtime
movie. Right? It's the same thing.

3341
02:53:22,650 --> 02:53:26,020
They showtime movie movies. The
documentary. Yup. Oh, I was confused.

3342
02:53:26,230 --> 02:53:29,230
I thought the showtime movie was,
had actors in it. It was a movie. No,

3343
02:53:29,260 --> 02:53:34,000
it's a documentary. Oh, I'm
an asshole. Okay. I was like,

3344
02:53:34,001 --> 02:53:36,610
when is this thing going to get released
and why is it I'm getting confused with

3345
02:53:36,611 --> 02:53:39,610
this other showtime documentary?
Right. Or show it to you.

3346
02:53:39,620 --> 02:53:41,890
Just move it aired on showtime,
but now they get, they have an,

3347
02:53:41,930 --> 02:53:45,970
I watched it on Itunes, I believe.
Okay. Cliffy be what's next for you?

3348
02:53:46,120 --> 02:53:51,120
I'm basically looking to
start a new studio looking,

3349
02:53:52,260 --> 02:53:57,260
you start a new studio to make some
ridiculous first person fast manly type

3350
02:53:57,521 --> 02:54:00,040
shooter. Aventador of shooters. Yeah.

3351
02:54:00,041 --> 02:54:03,150
Something that makes your Dick hard and
chewed flames. Flames out your ass. When,

3352
02:54:03,151 --> 02:54:04,090
when are you going to start doing this?

3353
02:54:04,140 --> 02:54:08,050
I'm talking to people about funding
right now. This isn't bitches get on it.

3354
02:54:08,080 --> 02:54:09,400
It's cliffy be you're talking to,

3355
02:54:09,430 --> 02:54:12,880
it's not some rank amateur through the
fucking cheese grinder since he was a

3356
02:54:12,881 --> 02:54:16,510
child. You know, when you're asking
for a certain amount of money,

3357
02:54:16,511 --> 02:54:19,390
there's certain strings
attached and there's due
diligence and all that Shit and

3358
02:54:19,391 --> 02:54:22,450
John Romero aside, you're a
different person than him. Okay.

3359
02:54:22,451 --> 02:54:24,340
You're not going to get their house.
Fair enough.

3360
02:54:24,430 --> 02:54:28,210
You're going to figure out how to keep
it together. My thing, Joe is, um, I,

3361
02:54:28,450 --> 02:54:31,810
I know my weaknesses and I joked that
if like I'm gonna make my Avengers,

3362
02:54:31,811 --> 02:54:34,270
I need my core like six leads,

3363
02:54:34,750 --> 02:54:38,260
like a Ninja art director and into
chief operating officer, like Ninja,

3364
02:54:38,590 --> 02:54:40,930
just those kinds of people.
And then like, you know,

3365
02:54:40,950 --> 02:54:42,220
we're all on the same page and,

3366
02:54:42,250 --> 02:54:46,600
and build the studio slowly
and intelligently build
the community while you

3367
02:54:46,601 --> 02:54:47,800
build a company while they build the game.

3368
02:54:47,830 --> 02:54:49,810
Do you have a timeline when
you'd like to get off the ground?

3369
02:54:49,840 --> 02:54:53,530
It depends on when the ink dries on
deals that are being negotiated. The,

3370
02:54:53,531 --> 02:54:56,650
my thing is I don't want to go with,

3371
02:54:57,040 --> 02:54:59,810
I'm scared of the old
guard cause you know,

3372
02:54:59,830 --> 02:55:01,990
the last thing I need is some
mid level executive going,

3373
02:55:01,991 --> 02:55:04,390
well traditionally this kind
of game doesn't do want,

3374
02:55:04,730 --> 02:55:07,580
therefore we're going to not market
it and therefore it doesn't do well.

3375
02:55:07,581 --> 02:55:12,410
So we told you so of a bitch.
Yeah, I don't like that at all.

3376
02:55:12,590 --> 02:55:13,423
How about that?

3377
02:55:13,670 --> 02:55:17,660
I mean the thing of the problem in
entertainment in general is the people who

3378
02:55:17,661 --> 02:55:21,290
usually are responsible for the
money or very rearward looking right.

3379
02:55:21,291 --> 02:55:24,590
And it's like Gretzky says,
go with a fucking puck's
going, not where the puck is.

3380
02:55:25,190 --> 02:55:28,390
You know like in the exact quote
and Gretzky. I love it. Yeah.

3381
02:55:28,490 --> 02:55:32,000
Executives go around e three and they're
like, oh, that's a World War II shooter.

3382
02:55:32,001 --> 02:55:33,800
We need one of that.
It's like it doesn't fucking work.

3383
02:55:33,801 --> 02:55:35,480
That wasn't that kind of
the problem with everything.

3384
02:55:35,481 --> 02:55:39,080
Now you get these mid level managers who
are trying to play the safe numbers and

3385
02:55:39,081 --> 02:55:41,780
trying to shoot things straight down
the middle and then the creative types.

3386
02:55:41,781 --> 02:55:43,850
So like why does it have to
be the way it's always been?

3387
02:55:43,850 --> 02:55:45,080
Why can't we do something weird?

3388
02:55:45,081 --> 02:55:47,780
Let's do something crazy and it's
due Buffy the vampire slayer,

3389
02:55:47,781 --> 02:55:50,980
but for fucking real shit. Yeah.
Scary. She had a complex two.

3390
02:55:52,140 --> 02:55:55,120
You got to fail early. Fail often. Dude,
we're out of time. Come back again.

3391
02:55:56,030 --> 02:55:58,040
Thanks for having me.
And if people want to file,

3392
02:55:58,041 --> 02:56:02,490
it's the real cliffy be on
Twitter. There's a bunch
of fake twitters for cliff.

3393
02:56:02,970 --> 02:56:05,960
Hi. Say last name Bill Zinsky Zinsky
you'd have known you for it. I know,

3394
02:56:05,961 --> 02:56:09,320
but I'm bad at Polish.
Bazinsky it's a hard one.

3395
02:56:09,350 --> 02:56:13,130
Joseph or Ghana bitch be alright.
Never go all the way.

3396

Just the tip. The uh, um, the
twitters, the real cliffy B,

3397
02:56:18,020 --> 02:56:20,090

in skis are bullshit.

3398

Brian,
we got going on,

3414
02:57:13,761 --> 02:57:17,030
you've got some shit happened on a
Wednesday that San Jose improper having a

3415
02:57:17,031 --> 02:57:20,570
dirty show and it's Tiffany Haddish,
Sam Aaa and myself.

3416
02:57:20,570 --> 02:57:24,920
Tickets are only $10 and available online
at [inaudible] dot TV or improv.com

3417
02:57:25,100 --> 02:57:26,450
and also check out Joe,

3418
02:57:26,451 --> 02:57:31,100
you were just saying Thunderpussy a
Friday and it was one of the coolest shows

3419
02:57:31,101 --> 02:57:31,401
ever.

3420
02:57:31,401 --> 02:57:36,290
You did a pretty much an hour set of all
new material and people are loving it.

3421
02:57:36,330 --> 02:57:38,070
So that's an ad Lib show that we,

3422
02:57:38,160 --> 02:57:43,160
that is on that squad network where we
go onstage and the audience just yells

3423
02:57:43,341 --> 02:57:47,000
out shit. It's very similar to what I
used to do after shows. I used to do it,

3424
02:57:47,001 --> 02:57:49,840
but it's better to do it this way where
the whole show is that way. Right.

3425
02:57:50,120 --> 02:57:54,290
You know, I think doing a three person
show like this is the way to go.

3426
02:57:54,291 --> 02:57:57,440
Like have a real show
where you just have ad Lib.

3427
02:57:57,590 --> 02:57:59,960
I'm going to start doing more of them
cause I think it's a great way to develop

3428
02:58:00,040 --> 02:58:02,050
materials that it was so
funny Joe and it just,

3429
02:58:02,080 --> 02:58:07,020
and it shifts so amazing watching you at
like something that's designed for you

3430
02:58:07,021 --> 02:58:10,770
so perfectly that you just slayed.
You came in there and just destroyed.

3431
02:58:10,771 --> 02:58:13,880
It was so cool watching man.
It was drunk as fuck Sean gets.

3432
02:58:13,881 --> 02:58:14,714
That's the key though.

3433
02:58:14,780 --> 02:58:17,700
Hi. Drunk. Drunk and high.
Yeah, you got to do that.

3434
02:58:17,701 --> 02:58:20,700
You've got to do it like your skin
and you don't know how to stop and uh,

3435
02:58:20,730 --> 02:58:23,430
but it was a really supportive crowd too,
so thanks everybody that came out.

3436
02:58:23,431 --> 02:58:25,650
It was a, it's easy to do
those if the crowds are cool.

3437
02:58:25,651 --> 02:58:27,990
If the crowds are shit heads,
it's not that much fun. Right.

3438
02:58:28,080 --> 02:58:31,740
Comedy is the only art form ever where
we can't really create it on our own.

3439
02:58:31,741 --> 02:58:34,900
We need you guys there. All right,
thanks everybody. Wednesday night, uh,

3440
02:58:34,990 --> 02:58:39,180
at the ice house a, I'll be
there with Tony Hinchcliffe, uh,

3441
02:58:39,210 --> 02:58:42,930
Mat fold Tron, Ian Edwards, uh, and more.

3442
02:58:42,931 --> 02:58:45,810
I'm sure we'll have more people
sign up before we do them.

3443
02:58:45,811 --> 02:58:49,920
On Wednesday nights once every two
weeks or so. And there are a lot of fun.

3444
02:58:50,160 --> 02:58:54,000
All right. We will be back tomorrow with
the Great Tommy Bonds, Aka Tom Score, m.

3445
02:58:54,330 --> 02:58:56,040
And. A. That's it. All
right. We love you. Bye.
