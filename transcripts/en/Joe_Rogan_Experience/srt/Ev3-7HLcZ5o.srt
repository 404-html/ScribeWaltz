1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,770
Five four,
three,

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,760
two
day Ruben lays gentlemen,

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,230
how are you buddy?
What's up bro?

4
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:11,910
Dude,
I haven't seen you a while.

5
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:13,710
The last time we saw each other,
it was just now,

6
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:16,980
but before that was right before the
election.

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,830
The day before the world changed.
Squirrely tourette's.

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,060
Squirly.
Doesn't that literally,

9
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:26,280
it seems like a lifetime ago.
Not even a lifetime ago.

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,250
It's like a different life for me.
I think it's a different life for you.

11
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:31,260
Think about how much has changed for
both of us in that time,

12
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:34,680
but it seems like another planet,
like an alternate universe of the day

13
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:37,440
before the election.
It is in a lot of ways,

14
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:39,510
right?
I mean people are,

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,100
the world's going,
well,

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,170
people are,
the world's trying to find its footing.

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,033
Yes.
You know,

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,790
it's a lot of craziness.
I hate to tell you jail.

19
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,250
Oh,
but you are a little piece of the

20
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:54,150
finding of the footing because people
are finding the footing.

21
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,860
You know,
I'm on tour repeaters in right now.

22
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,030
I just got in this morning from Atlanta
and it's like there is,

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,880
without being hyperbolic,
there is some kind of awakening

24
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:06,900
happening right now.
People are kinda getting their shit

25
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:09,420
together.
They're kind of sorting out things there

26
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,080
through long form conversations like
we're all having and all these people

27
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:16,140
that we're now connected with.
There's something happening where people

28
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:19,510
are going.
There's another way to make sense and

29
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,840
let me figure out what that is.
It doesn't mean we have all the answers

30
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,020
and I can sure as hell no I don't and I
don't think you think you do either,

31
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:28,050
but we're at least giving them a little
room to figure it out and it's pretty

32
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:28,621
cool.
Well,

33
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,320
the thing about Peterson that's been
fascinating is how many people

34
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:36,321
misrepresent what he says to try to
frame him him in a way that makes him

35
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:41,690
evil and mix their position seem more
ethical or more moral or better or more

36
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:43,470
intellectual.

37
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,340
There's so many articles being written
about him almost on a daily basis.

38
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,370
It is misrepresent what he's saying.
It's epic bullshit.

39
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,810
I mean weird.
That's all it is.

40
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:54,510
These guys want clicks.
That's all they want.

41
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,081
I mean,
I've,

42
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,630
we've done about 20 shows in the last
six weeks or so,

43
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:01,410
bounced around from Nashville and
Houston and Atlanta and Chicago and

44
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:04,410
everywhere else,
the crowds have been incredible.

45
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:05,400
It's,
it's probably split,

46
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:06,360
you know,
first off they always go,

47
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:07,830
well,
it's angry white men.

48
00:02:07,831 --> 00:02:09,600
That's the main thing.
It's all angry white men.

49
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:10,434
Now,
first off,

50
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,870
let's say it was all angry white men
there,

51
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,180
that in and of itself doesn't mean it's
bad.

52
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:18,570
Let's say there was like a really
disaffected group of angry white men

53
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:23,220
that really felt like by their
masculinity had been compromised or they

54
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:25,530
couldn't get jobs or they didn't feel
good about their lives.

55
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,900
Like if there was someone talking to
them that was helping them,

56
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,230
that would actually be good.
But let's just put that aside,

57
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:32,610
right.
Cause they don't mean it in a positive

58
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,220
way.
So they say it's all angry white.

59
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,780
But now I can tell you it's about 60,
40 male to female,

60
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,170
roughly.
Um,

61
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,160
at Jordan shows Jordan shows.
Yeah.

62
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,310
And it's,
do you think that's like dates that

63
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,890
reluctantly go along with men?
Like right.

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,640
There are some,
I mean there will be guys that you will,

65
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:49,500
he's actually,
usually girls will come up to me after

66
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:50,191
and they'll go,
you know,

67
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:53,430
he's a big fan of you guys are,
he loves Jordan are he loves you or Blah

68
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,840
Blah Blah,
and I'm just here.

69
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,080
But then they all have a great time.
I mean I'm telling you,

70
00:02:58,081 --> 00:03:00,130
this thing has been insane.
Love

71
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,810
Fest.
I know you saw the video that Jordan

72
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:04,030
posted last night.
It was his birthday last night.

73
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,190
We were at,
where the hell was I?

74
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:08,020
Atlanta,
the Tabernacle in Atlanta,

75
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,420
you know,
almost 3000 people singing happy

76
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:12,640
birthday to him.
We brought out this freaking stuffed

77
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:17,170
lobster and a and a piece of meat cause
he's on this crazy meat diet now and

78
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:19,930
it's like,
it's an endless love fest.

79
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,670
Every street.
We walked down,

80
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:24,700
people high five and us saying hi.
We did a little meet and greet impromptu

81
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:28,210
thing at the Lincoln memorial and about
a hundred people showed up just out of

82
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:30,640
nowhere.
And it's like these people are just

83
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:33,550
trying to figure shit out.
They're not white supremacists.

84
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:36,220
They're not all right.
They don't hate women.

85
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,510
It is literally nothing that they say
because they want clicks.

86
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,770
And the way they get clicks,
I mean,

87
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:43,150
you know,
the way they get clicks because they

88
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:44,980
saved the absolute reverse from the
truth.

89
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,230
It's not that they lie a little bit like
a little lie.

90
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,350
I think nobody would even pick up on it.
We don't think that's what they do.

91
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:52,570
I think they're just misrepresenting.
I don't think they're,

92
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:54,880
they're saying the APPS,
the opposite of the truth.

93
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,910
They're just,
they just look there.

94
00:03:56,911 --> 00:04:00,040
They're finding these little categories
like homophobia,

95
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:03,640
transphobia.
I'm not a homophobe,

96
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:06,130
he's on tour with a gay guy.
He's not a transplant.

97
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:07,360
There are trans people that show up
there.

98
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:09,940
And I,
and I discussed it with him every

99
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,181
freaking night.
I asked,

100
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:10,900
you know,
we do.

101
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,970
So I basically do like 15 minutes of
stand up,

102
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:14,620
up top.
He does an hour and a half and then we

103
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,570
do a q and a together.
Um,

104
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,620
and we bring out all of these things and
every night to clear it up and sometimes

105
00:04:20,621 --> 00:04:23,050
I'll have people bro bust out their
phones and I'll be like,

106
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:24,230
why don't you guys record this tonight?

107
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,670
Let's get it out on twitter where he
takes down the alt right because he

108
00:04:27,671 --> 00:04:31,840
hates the identity politics of the right
as much as the identity politics of the

109
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:32,421
left.
I mean,

110
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:34,450
I think,
I think the reason we all focus on the

111
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:38,080
thing of the left is because it has
encompassed culture in media and

112
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:39,790
politics and what you're allowed to say
and,

113
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,040
and uh,
universities and all of that.

114
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:46,840
So it makes more sense to focus on that.
The little sliver of it that's on the

115
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:48,100
right.
Yeah.

116
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,510
It's Shitty.
It's horrible.

117
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,750
You should not look at your skin color
as some great thing that makes you

118
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,880
better or,
but it's sort of right thing,

119
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:56,640
is racism always a right thing?
Like,

120
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,940
oh,
not at all racists,

121
00:04:57,941 --> 00:04:58,571
right?
No.

122
00:04:58,571 --> 00:05:01,280
I think the left is far more racist than
the right at this moment.

123
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,410
Yeah.
Why do you think that?

124
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,410
Because identity politics is based in
racism.

125
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,010
You happen to be white.
I know nothing about you by the color of

126
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:11,680
your skin.
I know about Joe Rogan because I watched

127
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:12,820
the show,
I listened to the show.

128
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:16,690
We've done this several times and we can
for the hours that we're going to sit

129
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:20,260
here now we can dive as deep into any
issue and that's the only way that I can

130
00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:23,950
sensibly judge you.
But the idea that you will look at

131
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:25,690
people that you would look at a black
person,

132
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:28,040
a black person will be sitting there or
a Muslim person will be sitting there

133
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,860
are transports and sitting there and
you'd go,

134
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:34,890
I have even an inkling of what you think
because of that immutable characteristic

135
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,070
that is actual racism that is
prejudging,

136
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,070
right?
Judging first before you know somebody.

137
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:47,190
So I have a much bigger issue with that
because that has infected everything in

138
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:50,320
American society right now.
The identity politics of the right,

139
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:52,540
that this should be a white ethno state
or something like that.

140
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:56,440
But it's that of course it's nonsense.
That's not really the identity politics

141
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:57,274
of the right.

142
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,110
Well,
I don't think the left is necessarily

143
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:01,040
that way either.
I mean,

144
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,890
I think the identity politics,
there's a real issue,

145
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:06,320
right,
with people that only identify with

146
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:09,350
other women,
women that only identify with women and

147
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:12,590
don't care about men.
There's a real issue with people that

148
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:15,560
are a only American.
They don't care about the rest of the

149
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:16,400
world.
This is like,

150
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,090
there's all these weird groups,
but I think we run into problems when we

151
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:20,871
start saying,
oh,

152
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:22,730
it's the left.
It's doing this as the right that's

153
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:24,710
doing this.
I think it's just tribal.

154
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,030
It's just this weird thing that human
beings tend to gravitate towards.

155
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:30,680
Crow tribes for sure.
And look,

156
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,560
we can we,
can I talk about things usually from a

157
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,690
little more of a political lens then I
think you do.

158
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:36,740
So yes,
of course.

159
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,610
Ultimately it is tribalism.
However you want to parse that

160
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:41,630
tribalism,
right?

161
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,590
So yes,
the law,

162
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:44,630
and I say this all the time,
but the left right thing doesn't make

163
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:46,760
that much sense anymore.
You're either basically,

164
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,930
you're basically for freedom.
You're for the individual to live

165
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:53,630
freely,
however they see fit or you believe that

166
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:57,230
the government should engineer things
and that there should be central

167
00:06:57,231 --> 00:06:59,810
planning so that people,
I think that's always shitty thinking.

168
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,140
I think that people that say that the
government should engineer things,

169
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,350
they're just looking for a solution and
then they think the government should

170
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:07,290
handle it.
So yeah,

171
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,190
I think we should pay more taxes or is
that going to go,

172
00:07:10,191 --> 00:07:12,710
it's going to go to the government and
what is it you're agreeing with me?

173
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,633
Yeah,
and a lot of,

174
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,450
oh okay.
I thought you said no,

175
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,940
no me.
Your thinking.

176
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,730
I mean their shift,
they're having shitty thinking.

177
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,040
It's like this idea that the
government's going to fix it.

178
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,800
The government is filled with people
like we don't have our own individual

179
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:27,320
solutions so we don't have a solution as
human.

180
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,020
Just as human beings,
objective human beings looking at

181
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:32,480
problems.
Why would we ever think that elected

182
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:33,680
officials,
these,

183
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,560
these people that are for the most part
full of shit,

184
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,100
like they're just trying to say whatever
they can say that's going to appease

185
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:43,400
both the special interest groups and the
lobbyists and the people that are

186
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:47,120
helping them get into place and people
are going to vote for them and you know,

187
00:07:47,121 --> 00:07:50,390
and then just sort of like skirt around
all the other issues that are

188
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:54,050
controversial to the point where they
can get into office named three

189
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:58,490
politicians that you really like.
I don't know any of them.

190
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,460
I mean,
I know.

191
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,290
All right.
Then Gary Johnson who is like,

192
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,870
who I like him too and I've heard it
before,

193
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,060
but he was the worst possible
libertarian candidate,

194
00:08:08,061 --> 00:08:10,130
you know,
who's the best libertarian candidate?

195
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,590
I mean ran.
Paul should be,

196
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:16,400
if he really had the balls to be what he
is going to learn how to stuff it

197
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,390
takedown.
Yeah,

198
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,040
right.
He's got a lot right guys coming at you

199
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,980
again,
you got to figure out a way to sprawl.

200
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,500
You could do,
you could do two hours with him and he'd

201
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:28,790
be a lot better and a lot of ways,
but he should be the guy but he doesn't

202
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:32,810
have the balls to do it because he wants
to maintain being a Republican senator

203
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:35,240
in Kentucky and he's not going to do it
if he has to leave the party.

204
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,420
But if,
but I've seen a major shift I think in

205
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,650
Republicans or at least conservatives or
generally people on the right,

206
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:46,820
whatever you want to call that thing.
There is a massive libertarian streak

207
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,810
that is alive in them right now,
which is why most of the people that I

208
00:08:50,811 --> 00:08:54,380
liked these days that I get along with
that I think are fair and decent and

209
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:56,550
honest are pretty much libertarian.

210
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,530
Define Libertarian,
libertarian,

211
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,930
so libertarian or classical liberal.
This is what I get more than anything

212
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:02,400
else.
Cause I say I'm a classical liberal,

213
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:04,830
which basically means you believe in the
individual.

214
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:08,880
The sovereignty of the individual is the
simple most important thing.

215
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,510
It is your life.
It is your duty to do what you see fit.

216
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,770
The government is supposed to do pretty
much nothing other than protect your

217
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:18,240
life.
So it's supposed to have an army and

218
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,830
police and stuff like that and then
really just laissez faire economics and

219
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:24,930
that.
And then the difference between

220
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,140
classical liberal and Libertarian is how
far do you want to go with the

221
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:30,720
government.
So I think there is some utility for the

222
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:33,000
state,
but the more I do this,

223
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:36,180
the more I have these conversations and
I talked to ann caps and real

224
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:41,181
libertarians and all that.
I find that hard to defend the state at

225
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:42,810
almost any level at this point.

226
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:46,470
But I do think that because I don't want
to live in Mad Max fury road just yet,

227
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:49,770
although we may be heading there,
I still will defend the state at some

228
00:09:49,771 --> 00:09:51,480
level.
But I would say everything should be

229
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,700
local.
We have an incredible experiment here

230
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:56,460
with 50 states.
If your state taxes too high,

231
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,930
move,
go somewhere else.

232
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,730
If your state doesn't have good
education,

233
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:01,530
you can go somewhere else.
If you don't like the weather somewhere.

234
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,840
But the second we make everything
federal,

235
00:10:03,841 --> 00:10:05,850
and this is what,
it's not just the left.

236
00:10:05,851 --> 00:10:09,120
This is what people who were using lazy
thinking that you referred to,

237
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,510
they think we should just have one law
that we should all live exactly the

238
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,610
same.
No matter where we are geographically,

239
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:18,900
no matter what our religion or what.
However we set our set of uses,

240
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,620
that is a nightmare.
That is a nightmare for a totalitarian

241
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:24,540
state because if,
if the federal government,

242
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,850
if one government controls everything,
guess what?

243
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,160
If you don't like it,
you got to leave the country.

244
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,450
You know,
go to Mexico,

245
00:10:30,451 --> 00:10:31,920
go to Canada,
you probably won't like it.

246
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:35,550
They're really referring to like in
terms of like you want subtle laws.

247
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,540
Well because you want states' rights you
should care about is state,

248
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,381
right?
So for example,

249
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:43,140
we live in California.
We are taxed out the fucking Wazoo.

250
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:45,720
I bought a house last year.
It's my first time at 41 years old that

251
00:10:45,721 --> 00:10:48,060
I owned property in America.
I made it.

252
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,340
I own property.
I don't have to tell you about my

253
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:51,870
property taxes.
They're insane.

254
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,030
They're very high.
They're absurdly,

255
00:10:54,031 --> 00:10:56,610
absurdly high.
That's the price you pay for living in a

256
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:58,260
spot where everybody wants to live.
No,

257
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,850
but that's it.
That's the beauty,

258
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:01,680
right?
So like there's a trade off there.

259
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:06,330
Now I could move to Texas and the
property taxes would be way low and

260
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:10,290
maybe because they don't tax as much the
schools are and as good or a series of

261
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,750
other things,
but that's the beauty of the foot vote.

262
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,730
You can go.
This is an experiment,

263
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:16,530
this thing in American who's against
that?

264
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,000
Anyone that wants to keep giving more
power to the federal government,

265
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:22,980
which is pretty much everybody these
days.

266
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,520
Pretty much everybody in mainstream.
Certainly all of the Democrats,

267
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,830
all of you know the,
the,

268
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:32,820
the mainstream set of Democrats and the
Bernie and the progressive crew.

269
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:36,090
They would love for the federal
government to control everything and

270
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:39,300
that is an absolute nightmare.
It's an absolute no control.

271
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:42,270
Everything like how so?
Like they want to control all economics,

272
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,640
department of Education,
a configure out,

273
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:46,680
all the environmental regulations,
all of those things.

274
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,620
I would kick back everything to the
states,

275
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,780
let the states decide.
And if you don't like it,

276
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,200
get going.
I mean,

277
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:54,430
that's,
that's a beautiful thing.

278
00:11:54,431 --> 00:11:56,680
If you,
if you really care about marijuana and

279
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:58,750
you live in Alabama right now and it's
not legal,

280
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,584
guess what?

281
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,660
Go to Colorado,
go to California.

282
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,650
I mean that,
that's,

283
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:06,190
that's how you'll influence things
because you can move your family,

284
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:09,160
your value,
whatever you bring to your community in

285
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,270
your life.
I mean,

286
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,000
think about it right now.
If California just kept taxing higher

287
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:15,390
and higher and kept screwing up a lot of
this,

288
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,970
a ton that's going wrong in the state,
eventually Joe Rogan might be like,

289
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,800
you know,
I just built this freaking kick ass new

290
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:22,960
studio here.
I'm now paying,

291
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,480
I don't know,
hundreds of thousands of dollars in

292
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:28,240
taxes and all this stuff.
You might want to try it somewhere else

293
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:30,940
where they're going to tax you less.
But that's the beauty of the thing.

294
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:32,230
You don't have to leave the country.
So the,

295
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,410
the federal government should pretty
much do nothing.

296
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,200
It should make sure we're not warring
with each other that the states aren't

297
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:41,050
warring that's about,
and then protect the borders.

298
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,480
Beyond that.
It doesn't have to do a lot.

299
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,420
Leave it to the states.
Let look if you had a problem here,

300
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,630
you know you're a sewage leak right
outside,

301
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,420
you want the federal government to deal
with that or do you want the local

302
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,480
municipality to deal with that?
You want everything to be as local as

303
00:12:55,481 --> 00:12:57,370
possible because that's how you'll
influence things.

304
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,490
And that's how you as an individual will
be empowered.

305
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,490
And that's all I have.

306
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:01,961
No,
I mean,

307
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:04,590
hearing what you're saying,
but I'm just not hearing this,

308
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,190
this clamoring for the government to
take care of everything.

309
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,120
I mean,
you hear,

310
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,420
you heard a little bit from Bernie,
you know,

311
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,950
but I just think again,
a lot of that is like,

312
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,550
it's not doing it now.
So the idea is that the solution would

313
00:13:17,551 --> 00:13:21,150
be if the government takes over and we
take more rich people's taxes,

314
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,340
you know,
and he will spout off about income

315
00:13:23,341 --> 00:13:26,130
inequality and take that money and
redistribute it.

316
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,200
And then somehow or another that's going
to fix everything.

317
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:29,730
But it's not,
you're just going to make government

318
00:13:29,731 --> 00:13:31,260
bigger.
You're going to have more jobs,

319
00:13:31,261 --> 00:13:32,910
you're gonna have more jobs in
government,

320
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,040
red tape,
more bureaucrats,

321
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,600
more bullshit.
So you're agreeing with,

322
00:13:36,601 --> 00:13:37,000
yeah.

323
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,960
Yeah,
for the most part.

324
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,060
I mean that's the thing.
It's like they look,

325
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:42,280
you want to give free college education,
everyone first off,

326
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,900
it's not free.
I mean that it's just,

327
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,330
this is just stupid lazy thinking to say
it is free.

328
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:48,500
It's not free.
You got to pay the janitor and you got

329
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:49,780
to pray the professors and everyone
else,

330
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,910
well they mean free for students.
And the,

331
00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:55,800
the idea of being that our taxes instead
of going towards the military,

332
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,760
they would go towards education.

333
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,410
Sure.
So they should at least be honest and

334
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:02,140
say that because a certain amount of
people just hear free and you just think

335
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,840
it's free but it's not free.
You obviously have to pay for it.

336
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,710
But also we're moving into an economy
where robots are taking over automa

337
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,420
automation is taking over,
go to,

338
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,270
you know what I think Mcdonald's said
within five years it's all going to be

339
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:16,450
ipads.
Go to half the Mcdonald's and you know,

340
00:14:16,451 --> 00:14:19,170
a fast food places in airports.
Now it's all ipad.

341
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,250
So if you're,
the more you're going to the government,

342
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:24,070
which doesn't do anything right or well
or efficiently,

343
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,210
the more they say,
okay,

344
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:27,280
private business,
you're going to have to spend more on

345
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:29,530
employees.
Well then all these businesses are just

346
00:14:29,531 --> 00:14:31,780
going to figure out ways which they
should do.

347
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:33,100
I mean that's ingenuity,
right?

348
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,090
They will figure out ways to save costs,
save expenses,

349
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:40,300
and then less people will be hired and
then at the same time we're going to be

350
00:14:40,301 --> 00:14:42,940
subsidized and all of these people to go
to college.

351
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,580
We're often in college,
they're learning nothing and gender

352
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:49,120
studies and,
and all of these other crazy classes and

353
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,890
we're just going to have this set of
people who have no real skills

354
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,440
and we're going to set up businesses
that will never want to hire them

355
00:14:54,441 --> 00:14:56,720
because the government is going to tell
them how much to pay.

356
00:14:56,721 --> 00:14:57,920
I mean,
you have employees here,

357
00:14:57,921 --> 00:15:00,170
you don't,
you pay them what you think is fair and

358
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:01,730
if they don't want to do it,
they don't have to.

359
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:03,560
But imagine if the government came in
and was like,

360
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,940
Joe,
you're going to have to pay your guys

361
00:15:04,941 --> 00:15:07,040
this amount.
It's ridiculous.

362
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,980
Well think how many people would love to
work for you for free.

363
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:11,720
I'm sure you get emails every day as I
do.

364
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,110
I don't want to,
I don't stalker.

365
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,760
Yeah.
I don't want people to work for me for

366
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:18,950
free.
But like the interns,

367
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:22,070
I don't like the idea of it silly.
But you're a small business owner.

368
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:25,460
I mean that's the fact.
And you should be able to do whatever

369
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:27,440
with your business and your property
that you want.

370
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,940
It's as simple as that.
I'm,

371
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:35,410
I think we get real,
there's a lot of cliche terms and one of

372
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:40,100
them is like that people who go to
college or studying gender studies or

373
00:15:40,101 --> 00:15:42,770
lesbian dance theory,
but how much of that is really

374
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:43,601
happening?
And then the man,

375
00:15:43,601 --> 00:15:46,610
it's very small.
It does exist in some weird states.

376
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:51,590
Like I'm sure you're aware of that lady
who was the professor from Fresno State

377
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:52,580
who,
uh,

378
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,440
got in trouble recently.
So many of them.

379
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:57,890
Which one was his?
Some big lady was talking a bunch of

380
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:00,380
shit.
It's just there and she said she could

381
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:03,540
never get fired.
They didn't fire that lane.

382
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,820
Yeah,
there's a lot of them.

383
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,550
I mean there's a lot of really wacky
professors out there that do have

384
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:08,181
tenure.
Yeah.

385
00:16:08,181 --> 00:16:11,330
That woman was tweeting out some bananas
stuff and she has tenure and she's not

386
00:16:11,331 --> 00:16:12,164
going to go anywhere.

387
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,600
There's universities all over the
country.

388
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,370
They're constantly teaching kids.
I mean,

389
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,540
for the most part,
these are there.

390
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,080
It's a small percentage.
It's a small percentage,

391
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:26,081
but they have way over influence on the
amount of people.

392
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,820
They have scared the majority into
silence.

393
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,900
I mean,
I don't know how often you're doing

394
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:31,390
colleges these days,
but I don't do it.

395
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,740
I'm doing them all the time and what I
find,

396
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:35,690
so I did this thing at University of New
Hampshire.

397
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,880
We posted,
saw it,

398
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,110
so look,
they first off,

399
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:41,390
what they did was they were supposed to
be about 300 people there.

400
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,890
So they,
at first,

401
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:45,890
because of the protestors,
the school said we can't secure a room.

402
00:16:45,891 --> 00:16:48,440
So thinking what are they protesting you
about?

403
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,480
Well,
I was split technically I was supposed

404
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:54,290
to be there that day with candace owens
and Charlie Kirk from turning point and

405
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,570
we were going to talk about cultural
appropriation and you know,

406
00:16:56,571 --> 00:16:58,010
some of the hot hot button stuff.

407
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,730
So I don't even know that they all were
there to protest me specifically.

408
00:17:01,731 --> 00:17:04,160
But anyway,
that day was the day that can,

409
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:08,070
and Charlie ended up on TMZ with Kanye,
so they bailed on me and just left the

410
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:11,020
left me for the wolves.
They were on Tmz with Kanya.

411
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:12,980
We've been just a couple of weeks ago.
They,

412
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,410
Kanye showed up at the TMC offices with
them.

413
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,340
So they just showed up with him and they
blew off there.

414
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,720
Yeah,
they're all good appearance.

415
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,120
Yeah,
it's all right.

416
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,830
When was it was me.
It was me and university of New

417
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,400
Hampshire or Kanye and TMZ.
Yeah.

418
00:17:26,401 --> 00:17:29,540
But they had a schedule like they're
supposed to be there and they just

419
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:33,650
decided not to run again.
So the people like paid to have you

420
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:34,190
come.
Yeah.

421
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:34,970
Right.
Yeah.

422
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,460
And they were supposed to be paid to go
to come to think of it.

423
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,010
I didn't get more money for this.
That is ridiculous.

424
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,500
The whole thing's ridiculous that they
would just blow that off.

425
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,760
It's like,
that's a Gig.

426
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,450
You don't blow off a gig because Kanye
wants to go on the gossip show.

427
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,040
Yeah.
But now you're fucking stupid.

428
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,700
Or what?
Now you're talking to me like as a

429
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:51,241
comic.
Good.

430
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:51,931
It's like,
yeah,

431
00:17:51,931 --> 00:17:53,370
we wouldn't do that.
It's just a different,

432
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:54,810
you don't blow off a Gig.
Yeah.

433
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,180
It's just a different,
but come to see you don't just decide,

434
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,100
oh,
this gig is better for me right now.

435
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,910
Yeah.
I'm just curious.

436
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:04,910
With Kanye on TV,
Hi Harvey Harvey that they spent time

437
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:07,880
with Harvey Levin instead of me.
Well,

438
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,550
he seems like a nice enough guy.
Yeah.

439
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,970
This business is a little shady.
Yeah.

440
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,520
But the whole thing behind it is you
don't,

441
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:19,320
you don't cancel a gig because he got
another Gig that you think is better for

442
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:20,670
you last minute.

443
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,620
Like that's terrible.
What's that phrase,

444
00:18:22,621 --> 00:18:24,150
man?
The show must go on.

445
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,890
Yeah,
it's supposed to go on.

446
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,783
Yeah,
for sure.

447
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,860
So I saw you getting,
uh,

448
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,950
was that the lady that the coins,
the jar,

449
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,710
they brought noise makers.
They were slamming on shit.

450
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:37,050
They were screaming things where it's so
ridiculous.

451
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:39,400
Like you would let them talk and they
didn't have any to say.

452
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,800
I mean the best part of this.
So first off,

453
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,770
300 people supposed to be there.
They say we can't secure a room on

454
00:18:43,771 --> 00:18:45,450
campus.
So think about what a defeat that is.

455
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:47,310
So this is where you might say,
okay,

456
00:18:47,311 --> 00:18:50,640
it's a minority of students,
but think how they affect the majority.

457
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,790
That meant that the University of New
Hampshire,

458
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:57,030
it's a pretty solid school in the live
free or state live free or die state.

459
00:18:57,031 --> 00:19:00,270
Right.
They could not secure because I'm

460
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:01,980
showing up a room on their campus.

461
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,230
So that's already a massive loss.
When you,

462
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,060
when you say could not secure you mean
safety wise,

463
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,980
he said they could not secure it.
Safety wise.

464
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,900
There were too many threats,
whatever the hell that means.

465
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:13,800
Twitter chat or other non,
so candice and the other guy are gone.

466
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,330
So it's just you?
Yeah,

467
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,880
the,
the Gay Libertarian Guy.

468
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,190
And they're like,
too dangerous.

469
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,450
Too dangerous,
too crazy.

470
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,520
Like what is he going to say?
We're going to,

471
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:25,410
we're going to have to silence him.
Yeah.

472
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,570
Well I flipped the script on their
heads.

473
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:28,890
I mean,
that's what it comes down to.

474
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:32,010
Like they don't know what the fuck to
make of me because I don't play their

475
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:34,050
game,
but I'm just doing what I think is

476
00:19:34,051 --> 00:19:35,580
right.
I don't think I'm a freaking rocket

477
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:37,260
scientist.
I don't think I'm some massive

478
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:39,840
intellectual.
I think I'm someone that can communicate

479
00:19:39,841 --> 00:19:41,220
these ideas pretty well.

480
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,900
And uh,
and hopefully we'll talk about it.

481
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:44,730
But I'm back in,
stand up now like I'm doing,

482
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,790
I'm just doing what I think is right on
this planet while I'm here.

483
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,040
That's it.
And so when you do these speeches,

484
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,990
what do you do when you go to these
colleges?

485
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,070
So,
so I get up there,

486
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:56,940
so they move it from this,
from the university 300 seat room.

487
00:19:56,941 --> 00:20:00,690
They move it to a hockey rink of 7,500
seats.

488
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,870
So think how absurd this absurd,
this is 300 people and they're in a,

489
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,320
how many people are in the audience?
300 people.

490
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,140
Oh God.
So apparently they didn't apparently

491
00:20:10,141 --> 00:20:12,150
like another hundred supporters of mine
showed up,

492
00:20:12,151 --> 00:20:14,760
but they didn't even let them in.
And even though they were roughly 7,000,

493
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:17,070
100 empty seats,
why wouldn't they let him in?

494
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,530
I Dunno.
Cause at that point security starts,

495
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:20,610
everything just gets whacked.

496
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,260
I mean this happens at every college
thing.

497
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:24,300
Like nobody knows who's in charge
anymore,

498
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,430
you know,
it's just like this big cluster fuck.

499
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,070
So anyway,
so they put up a step and repeat with

500
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:31,170
the turning point symbol behind me and
I'm doing my thing.

501
00:20:31,171 --> 00:20:33,090
But there's a freaking Sam bony back
there.

502
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,410
I'm like,
what the hell am I doing?

503
00:20:34,411 --> 00:20:37,080
Like this is ridiculous.
And turning point is that conservative

504
00:20:37,081 --> 00:20:40,710
think tank things.
They're the largest conservative,

505
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:41,940
uh,
college.

506
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,850
A nonprofit.
So why do they have that behind you?

507
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,350
Well,
cause he was sponsored by them.

508
00:20:46,351 --> 00:20:47,900
Charlie.
Charlie runs turning points.

509
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:48,250
Okay.

510
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,550
Yeah.
But he didn't even have the fucking show

511
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:53,290
up.
It was either that that then goes,

512
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,430
they were,
I sit literally,

513
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:55,890
I stand there and literally in front of,
you know,

514
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,760
6,000 seats.
Seriously.

515
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,320
Why?
Yeah.

516
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:00,250
I mean,
that's for,

517
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,930
for them to figure out why they did
that.

518
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:04,900
But Anyway,
7,000 empty seats.

519
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:06,940
I do my thing.
I talked for about a half hour and I

520
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:08,400
knew they were a certain,
you know,

521
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,710
250 of those kids were there to listen
and agree or disagree.

522
00:21:11,711 --> 00:21:12,311
I mean,
think about it.

523
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:13,930
These,
this is the conservative group.

524
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:16,780
They're bringing a gay married guy who's
pro pod,

525
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:19,240
who's pro euthanasia,
who's against the death penalty for

526
00:21:19,241 --> 00:21:21,340
reforming the prison system.
Uh,

527
00:21:21,341 --> 00:21:23,500
I'm pro choice.
Like I could go on and on about the

528
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:25,360
liberal crowd that you and I don't get
anymore.

529
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:26,801
And they're,
they're,

530
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:28,450
they're applauding.
What do they,

531
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:29,950
what are they mad at you for?

532
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,120
Well,
so it's not those guys,

533
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,100
man.
It's,

534
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,553
they're mad.
They,

535
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,580
if they don't know,
they just want you to bow forever.

536
00:21:36,581 --> 00:21:39,190
They don't come to listen.
They want to silence.

537
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,920
That's it.
They just want to silence you about like

538
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:44,130
what is it that they oppose that you're
saying Joe,

539
00:21:44,131 --> 00:21:48,340
I w I literally,
every time I they would scream or they'd

540
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:49,360
start robotically,
you know,

541
00:21:49,361 --> 00:21:51,520
they set timers and then they
robotically chant.

542
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,620
We're not the problem or just some other
nonsense.

543
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,790
We're not,
we are not the problem we are.

544
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,270
I'd go,
I'd look at them right in the eye and be

545
00:21:58,271 --> 00:21:59,980
like,
I'm standing right in front of you.

546
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,770
Do you have a question for me?
Is there something that I said that

547
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:04,090
upset you?
Any of that?

548
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,220
And they can't respond.
They,

549
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,700
I mean they just can't respond because
they're not there to exchange ideas.

550
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,610
They believe they are oppressed and they
boo.

551
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:13,361
I mean,
look,

552
00:22:13,361 --> 00:22:15,310
I always go up there,
what do I say at every college thing I

553
00:22:15,311 --> 00:22:17,140
go,
think about it.

554
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,210
Do you think you have it worse than,
than your grandparents?

555
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:22,060
I want everyone in this room to think
about your grandparents right now and

556
00:22:22,061 --> 00:22:26,290
99.9% of people in America right now
have it better than their grandparents

557
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,700
had it.
I'm sure you have it better than your

558
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:29,920
grandparents had.
I have better than my grandparents had

559
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:31,210
it.
All of these kids,

560
00:22:31,211 --> 00:22:34,450
they're at University of New Hampshire
studying whatever the hell they want to

561
00:22:34,451 --> 00:22:36,010
study.
They have it better than their

562
00:22:36,011 --> 00:22:38,650
grandparents.
But that the power of thinking that

563
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:41,740
you're oppressed,
the power of thinking that the world is

564
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:46,120
warped against you is it's a drug.
It is truly a drug.

565
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,830
And one of the things on that,
so it turns out,

566
00:22:47,831 --> 00:22:49,750
did you see the exchange I got in with
the Trans Woman?

567
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,130
Yes.
So it turns,

568
00:22:51,131 --> 00:22:54,160
so this trans woman is telling me to go
fuck myself and whatever she's saying

569
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,770
and screaming along with everybody we'll
ship set about.

570
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,530
Well cause I mentioned the Jordan
Peterson Pronoun thing and I said,

571
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:01,450
look,
I want trans people to be treated

572
00:23:01,451 --> 00:23:04,060
equally under the law.
I want trans people to be respected.

573
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,730
I hope you find,
I literally said to her looking right at

574
00:23:06,731 --> 00:23:07,361
her,
I hope,

575
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:09,370
I hope you find someone that loves you
and your life.

576
00:23:09,371 --> 00:23:12,070
I mean all,
I want you to be as equal and happy as

577
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:15,040
anybody else on this planet.
That is what I want for you.

578
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,410
She's still telling me to go fuck
myself.

579
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,420
It turns out,
I didn't know this till weeks later.

580
00:23:19,421 --> 00:23:23,500
I found this out about a week ago.
She's a professor of gender studies at

581
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:26,440
University of New Hampshire.
So she's literally trying,

582
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:31,540
you have a professor that is part of the
protesters and she's live tweeting the

583
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:32,470
thing about,
all right,

584
00:23:32,471 --> 00:23:33,460
Dave Ruben.
I mean,

585
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,060
so that's where,
when,

586
00:23:35,061 --> 00:23:36,910
when people think it's this little
thing,

587
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,660
it's,
yeah,

588
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,230
it's this little thing that's,
that's metastasizing and spreading like

589
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:43,720
a cancer.
And I truly believe that identity

590
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:45,190
politics,
that this thing,

591
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,040
I think is

592
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,310
the biggest threat to the west and to
freedom that exists.

593
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:54,200
Did you communicate with her at all?
I communicated her from with my mic and

594
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:56,480
then was there,
did she exchange say what?

595
00:23:56,481 --> 00:23:59,570
She has a problem.
So she kept yelling at me and people can

596
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,220
have a video of this.
Oh yeah,

597
00:24:01,221 --> 00:24:03,720
it's there.
I don't know where it's probably maybe

598
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,810
an hour in herself.
Um,

599
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,010
I saw it and I just was like,
oh poor,

600
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,860
what's he dealing with?
I got a lot of pity for that,

601
00:24:09,861 --> 00:24:11,080
which was good.
It was like,

602
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,970
you know what,
I was shaking the jar coins.

603
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,813
I was like,
Oh,

604
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:17,240
you know,
it was really funny is that I realized

605
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:19,370
that there's one,
so there's one moment and I never lost

606
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:21,110
my cool cause it's like it's a bunch of
kids yelling

607
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:25,490
and as long as they're not going to take
a Samurai sword out and stab me or

608
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:26,210
anything,
then it,

609
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:26,780
then it's fine.

610
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,960
But there was one moment where they just
kept going and going.

611
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,840
So I sarcastically said it.
I was like,

612
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:36,440
guys shut the fuck up.
And it got a big laugh and then I

613
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,860
repeated it a couple times,
but then I realized that when the school

614
00:24:39,861 --> 00:24:41,270
newspaper wrote about it,
they said,

615
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,880
and then Dave Ruben told them to shut
the fuck up.

616
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,750
Shut the fuck up is very different than
shut the fuck up.

617
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,900
So that was my one,
my one lesson in there,

618
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:57,200
it seems like is the answer.
She didn't want anything from me.

619
00:24:57,201 --> 00:25:01,280
She wanted me to be thrown out for doing
that because if you are doing that,

620
00:25:01,281 --> 00:25:03,560
you're,
you're disrupting a performance.

621
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,930
I mean,
I'm sure you would have a q and a with

622
00:25:05,931 --> 00:25:06,561
those people.
Right.

623
00:25:06,561 --> 00:25:08,000
He'd be happy to do that.
Do it.

624
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:10,340
And if they're a half hour,
I opened it up for q and a so let's do

625
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:11,480
the rest of the last hour.

626
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,730
But you didn't even get a chance to get
to that with her.

627
00:25:13,731 --> 00:25:15,550
Right.
She was already yelling at know and then

628
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,610
I think I even said to her,
I know I did it.

629
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,550
Several people.
I'm pretty sure she was too.

630
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:23,050
Do you have a question for me?
And I think her last thing was your,

631
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,460
I hate you or something.
Something to that effect.

632
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,210
I mean this is a professor should be,
she should be disqualified for teaching.

633
00:25:29,211 --> 00:25:32,750
She's an a logical thinker.
This is not what you want raising your

634
00:25:32,751 --> 00:25:33,560
children.
Yeah.

635
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,200
But essentially that's what they are.
They're still children.

636
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,480
You got this fucking dummy who can't
focus enough to have a coherent argument

637
00:25:43,581 --> 00:25:45,950
that they're yelling out in the middle
of your performance.

638
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,720
And by the way,
for the record,

639
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,930
the uh,
authorities or the police or the campus

640
00:25:50,931 --> 00:25:51,770
safety,
whatever it was,

641
00:25:51,771 --> 00:25:54,680
did at one point try to have some people
sit down and be quiet.

642
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,000
And I was like guys don't worry about
it.

643
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,000
Cause it's like yeah,
I guess we could escalate it to that

644
00:25:59,001 --> 00:26:01,520
point.
I didn't even want this video to be

645
00:26:01,521 --> 00:26:04,460
released when they videotape this.
I did not want it to be released cause I

646
00:26:04,461 --> 00:26:07,210
don't want to add fuel to the fire.
I'm trying to fix some of these products

647
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,180
as part of the problem.
Right.

648
00:26:08,181 --> 00:26:11,630
Is that this becomes something that they
know that they can get a video of if

649
00:26:11,631 --> 00:26:13,760
they go to your next performance and
interrupt you.

650
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:14,780
Yeah.
But you know what?

651
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:17,000
I don't think they want one person over
to their side.

652
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:21,500
I don't think one screaming lunatic who,
who did not come to respect me even

653
00:26:21,501 --> 00:26:24,350
though I was there to respect them.
I don't think they want anybody.

654
00:26:24,351 --> 00:26:26,390
I think I actually want a lot of people
to my side.

655
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:28,250
And I think,
I mean I know it cause I've received

656
00:26:28,251 --> 00:26:29,180
tons of emails about it.

657
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,180
I know what you're saying,
but I don't think it's about winning to

658
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:34,520
your side.
I think it's about other lunatics that

659
00:26:34,521 --> 00:26:37,550
realize that there's an opportunity to
get attention if they go to your show

660
00:26:37,551 --> 00:26:38,750
and yell things out.
Yeah,

661
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:42,170
well that's why we ended up putting the
video up because a couple of them would

662
00:26:42,171 --> 00:26:44,850
put up these little clips,
very selectively edited that made it

663
00:26:44,851 --> 00:26:48,030
seem like I was doing things that I
wasn't like I was silencing them or just

664
00:26:48,031 --> 00:26:49,710
some other nonsense.
So then finally I was like,

665
00:26:49,711 --> 00:26:51,480
all right,
if this is the way the Internet is and

666
00:26:51,481 --> 00:26:53,640
it just is,
then we'll just put up the whole thing

667
00:26:53,641 --> 00:26:56,130
on edited.
Even though I had 10 minutes before,

668
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:56,581
I said,
guys,

669
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:58,530
don't even record this.
I said,

670
00:26:58,531 --> 00:27:01,290
don't even record this,
because because Charlie and candice

671
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:03,240
hadn't showed up and I was like,
it's ridiculous.

672
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,930
I got 7,000 empty seats behind me.
But then once people start playing that

673
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:09,360
game,
you can either just be the bitch,

674
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:12,120
which I refuse to be,
or you can fight back.

675
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,270
Yeah.
It's a weird place to be because you

676
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:19,410
know what they're doing and they're
essentially just trying to rile you up.

677
00:27:19,411 --> 00:27:21,840
And if they're not willing to have a
real dialogue with you,

678
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:23,430
they're just yelling,
fuck Dave Rubin.

679
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,040
That really should disqualify you from
being a teacher.

680
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,800
I mean that's,
that's the worst way to communicate.

681
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:31,800
You're demonstrating that you're
thinking sucks and that you want to

682
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:34,860
teach about gender studies,
but yet you know,

683
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:35,743
you,
you,

684
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:40,290
you're interrupting a comp and you're
trying to claim transphobia or whatever

685
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,650
the fuck he's,
she is trying to claim she,

686
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,870
it's a she right?
She,

687
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:49,650
she's a trans woman,
but she was a man not as a woman.

688
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,440
Yeah.

689
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,540
Yeah.
By the way,

690
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:54,420
I treated her with complete respect.
Like that's the thing,

691
00:27:54,421 --> 00:27:55,530
they,
they truly,

692
00:27:55,531 --> 00:27:58,530
they want you,
they want to put their foot on your neck

693
00:27:58,531 --> 00:28:02,640
and have you stay there forever.
And that's why every time now that

694
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:05,370
somebody's mainstream writes something
about you,

695
00:28:05,371 --> 00:28:08,280
half the time they're calling you a
conservative cause they don't know what

696
00:28:08,281 --> 00:28:13,281
the fuck to do with this guy who's
talking about drugs and all the crazy

697
00:28:13,891 --> 00:28:15,090
shit you're talking about.
All the time,

698
00:28:15,091 --> 00:28:20,091
but also you're woke enough to actually
identify there is a problem here with

699
00:28:20,371 --> 00:28:23,580
what's happening in the mainstream.
So they can't categorize us in any

700
00:28:23,581 --> 00:28:25,140
sensible way.
So in a weird way,

701
00:28:25,141 --> 00:28:28,350
especially because me and you also,
because of the nature of what we do,

702
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,870
we sit from people that are a little
scary.

703
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,910
You know what I mean?
Like you've had Jones on,

704
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,260
I've had molyneux on I,
you know,

705
00:28:34,261 --> 00:28:36,150
I had certain a bit John at the,
at the beginning,

706
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,020
and I'm sure you've had plenty of other
controversial people and it's like,

707
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,300
so they,
there's an odd way that they want to

708
00:28:42,301 --> 00:28:46,200
look at the two of us more than other
people because we,

709
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,800
by the nature of our jobs,
by the nature of how we exist,

710
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:50,880
that's a threat.

711
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,770
If you want to control the way everybody
thinks.

712
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,391
Hmm.
Yeah.

713
00:28:54,391 --> 00:28:56,310
You're not supposed to give people a
platform.

714
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,330
That's what I keep hearing.
Yeah.

715
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,490
So,
so what's your policy on that?

716
00:28:59,491 --> 00:29:02,430
Because that seemed to be the,
after this idw intellectual dark web

717
00:29:02,431 --> 00:29:05,070
article came out,
that was the big thing that people kept

718
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,140
hitting me on.
It's like you don't want any

719
00:29:07,141 --> 00:29:09,090
gatekeeping.
You'll talk to anybody and first off,

720
00:29:09,091 --> 00:29:13,200
I won't talk to anybody,
but I'm a general believer that you let

721
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:16,470
ideas out there,
but what is wrong with talking to people

722
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,110
and it's always been what people have
done their,

723
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,640
they've always been interviews with
controversial people.

724
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,320
Guess what happens when you stop talking
to people?

725
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,180
Yeah,
not good.

726
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,410
Yeah.
That's when shit goes down.

727
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,020
But there's a lot of people that don't
want us talking to people.

728
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,690
I mean I look,
a lot of people were pissed you,

729
00:29:29,691 --> 00:29:31,320
you smoke pot with Jones,
right?

730
00:29:31,321 --> 00:29:32,300
You smoke.
Not with Alex.

731
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,930
I watched it.
It's bananas.

732
00:29:33,931 --> 00:29:35,910
I watched all the games and it's like,
look,

733
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:40,110
that guy has done some seriously twisted
crazy shit.

734
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,010
There is no doubt about it.
The Sandy Hook

735
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,140
stuff,
and I didn't know about the sandy hook

736
00:29:44,141 --> 00:29:46,000
stuff by the way,
before we did the podcast,

737
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:49,780
I knew that he believes a bunch of
stupid conspiracies that are genuinely

738
00:29:49,781 --> 00:29:51,850
just dismissed,
but I didn't know that he was saying

739
00:29:51,851 --> 00:29:56,140
that those kids never died or that it
was going to change the equation for

740
00:29:56,141 --> 00:29:56,331
you.
Yeah,

741
00:29:56,331 --> 00:29:58,660
it would have been mad at him and I
would have talked about it right away.

742
00:29:58,661 --> 00:30:00,460
I would've been like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

743
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:02,260
This kids are dead.
Like there's a guy that was,

744
00:30:02,261 --> 00:30:04,840
uh,
it was a terrible story about a guy who

745
00:30:04,841 --> 00:30:07,860
was a conspiracy theorist before sandy
hook.

746
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:11,650
Then his kid died at Sandy Hook and a
bunch of people were threatening him and

747
00:30:11,651 --> 00:30:14,500
calling him a crisis actor and saying
his kid never died.

748
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,050
And then he realized how insane it
really is.

749
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,230
People are looking for conspiracies
everywhere,

750
00:30:20,231 --> 00:30:20,500
man.

751
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:25,090
I keep hearing them now about Anthony
Bordain that bordain was going to expose

752
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:28,540
some child pedophile ring and that's why
they suicided him.

753
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:30,280
It's fucking stupid,
man.

754
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,020
Without going down and fully on that
road.

755
00:30:32,021 --> 00:30:33,970
There is one odd thing about the bordain
thing,

756
00:30:33,971 --> 00:30:36,580
which is just a few weeks ago,
didn't he tweet some odd thing about

757
00:30:36,581 --> 00:30:37,820
having the,
the,

758
00:30:37,821 --> 00:30:40,990
he's met the Hillary Clinton like
machine or something and it's wrong.

759
00:30:40,991 --> 00:30:42,490
And he was talking about,
no,

760
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,590
no,
I'll tell you exactly what he was

761
00:30:44,591 --> 00:30:48,430
talking about.
The same people that Harvey Weinstein

762
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:51,100
used would that were,
um,

763
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:54,430
Israeli,
what does it black cue or some shit.

764
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:59,050
See what you find the tweet because
[inaudible] he was basically saying

765
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,250
that,
uh,

766
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:06,210
Donald Trump's people use the same
people that Harvey Weinstein used

767
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:11,080
Israeli intelligence group too.
You know,

768
00:31:11,081 --> 00:31:14,650
there was something that Harvey had done
to his victims where he was trying to

769
00:31:14,651 --> 00:31:17,380
silence them by scaring them with these,
uh,

770
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,380
these,
you know,

771
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,240
Israeli mercenary type folks don't go
down that conspiracy.

772
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,620
That's not what he was doing with me.
He was just saying,

773
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,310
God is just standing there like he's
got,

774
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,130
he had some crazy thing with his
girlfriend.

775
00:31:30,131 --> 00:31:34,060
We was like fully invested in her battle
with Harvey Weinstein,

776
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,010
you know,
so that's what he tweeted about.

777
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,140
But it was,
it's like they would kill him for that.

778
00:31:38,141 --> 00:31:39,920
Like that's so fucking stupid.
Yeah.

779
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,850
Well what about Ronan Farrow?
What about all the people that wrote the

780
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:44,770
story?
What about all the people that are

781
00:31:44,771 --> 00:31:48,190
accusing him of rape like this?
The guy's going broke.

782
00:31:48,191 --> 00:31:51,190
Two d people don't understand that
Harvey Weinstein's businesses going

783
00:31:51,191 --> 00:31:52,870
bankrupt.
He's fucked.

784
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,790
He's going to jail.
It's,

785
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,410
the walls are caving in.
He doesn't even have his business

786
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,160
anymore.
I ran a mercenary to go kill a chef.

787
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,050
I mean,
this is fucking stupid.

788
00:32:02,051 --> 00:32:04,570
This is stupid thinking and you know,
look,

789
00:32:04,571 --> 00:32:06,730
it's not,
it's not that it's impossible for

790
00:32:06,731 --> 00:32:08,800
someone who will want to hire someone to
kill someone.

791
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,770
But I don't think that's what happened.
I think he killed himself.

792
00:32:11,771 --> 00:32:13,570
And I think it's a terrible,
terrible tragedy.

793
00:32:13,571 --> 00:32:18,490
And I think it's really disrespectful to
have all these dumb speculative ideas

794
00:32:18,491 --> 00:32:21,550
because there's sport in conspiracies.
It's a sport.

795
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:24,220
It's a game.
There's a hobby that people have.

796
00:32:24,221 --> 00:32:26,410
And looking to fucking,
I'm looking for the truth bro.

797
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:30,430
I'm looking at fucking close the gaps.
This is what it is,

798
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:31,510
man.
It's the Illuminati.

799
00:32:31,511 --> 00:32:34,690
The second you think you got it right
here.

800
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,760
Um,
okay.

801
00:32:36,761 --> 00:32:38,050
Here it is.
Hold on.

802
00:32:38,051 --> 00:32:40,970
Scroll up.
I am in no way Hillary Quinn.

803
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:44,810
I've been on the receiving end of her
operatives wrath and it ain't fun.

804
00:32:44,811 --> 00:32:46,030
Right?
And that's from about a month ago.

805
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:48,320
Those operatives,
Oh,

806
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,120
here we go.
Now you're going to fill some gaps for

807
00:32:50,121 --> 00:32:52,470
me.
Her operatives wrath.

808
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,470
Okay.
Know,

809
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:59,620
but he was,
the thing is Hillary Clinton was before

810
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:02,600
the track,
before the scandal happened,

811
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:05,740
there's a lot of photos of Hillary
Clinton hanging out with Weinstein.

812
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,490
Yeah.
Oprah hanging out with them out.

813
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:10,340
Everybody cuddle and Meryl Streep,
Meryl Streep,

814
00:33:10,341 --> 00:33:13,880
cuddling up with them.
Like the whole thing is there's people

815
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:16,940
that are complicit for sure in one way
or another.

816
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,540
So after everything you just said and
knowing that Joanne's plays that game a

817
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:22,130
little bit,
would you have him on again?

818
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,170
If I had them on again,
that would be the first thing I would

819
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:25,250
talk about.
You know,

820
00:33:25,251 --> 00:33:26,084
I'm,
I'm,

821
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:30,560
I've been friends with Alex since 1998
I've known him for a long time.

822
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:34,130
I don't think he's a bad guy,
but I think he's very wrong about a lot

823
00:33:34,131 --> 00:33:36,050
of things.
He's very misguided about a lot of

824
00:33:36,051 --> 00:33:38,660
things and I think he loves
conspiracies.

825
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:41,990
There is a bunch of people in this
country that love to make,

826
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:46,280
they will have to connect the dots and
find conspiracies in fucking everything.

827
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,570
Everything that there is.

828
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:50,060
And sometimes the right and Alex has
been right.

829
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,220
Definitely.
He's been right about a bunch of things.

830
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,540
He was right about the World Trade
Organization particular about when they

831
00:33:56,541 --> 00:34:01,541
were using agent provocateur tours to
disrupt protests and make them violent

832
00:34:02,451 --> 00:34:05,990
protests by smashing windows.
And he documented all of it and all

833
00:34:05,991 --> 00:34:08,540
these people were um,
none of them were arrested.

834
00:34:08,541 --> 00:34:12,560
They were all,
they all went to one safe house and then

835
00:34:12,561 --> 00:34:14,330
negotiated with the police.
Then they were released,

836
00:34:14,331 --> 00:34:15,730
they all had military,
um,

837
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,130
military issue footwear.
Like he's got all these,

838
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:22,760
the,
these documents from people that worked

839
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:27,530
inside either police or law enforcement
that say that there is a standard

840
00:34:27,531 --> 00:34:31,550
practice and this is existed for a long
time and when you have peaceful protest

841
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:35,250
and you can't do anything about it,
the best way to do something about it is

842
00:34:35,251 --> 00:34:38,240
to take that peaceful protest and turn
it non peaceful.

843
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:38,941
Yeah.
The way you do that,

844
00:34:38,941 --> 00:34:40,910
he have these guys wear masks,
they go in,

845
00:34:40,911 --> 00:34:42,140
they pretend they're one of the
protesters.

846
00:34:42,141 --> 00:34:45,290
They start smashing windows,
flipping over cars and then you move the

847
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,270
cops and then they shut the protest
down.

848
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,340
So you essentially shut the peaceful
protesters down by introducing non

849
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:55,850
peaceful people and you,
these are military operatives,

850
00:34:55,851 --> 00:34:59,060
these are people that are working for
the government or working for whoever

851
00:34:59,061 --> 00:35:02,480
the fuck decides to pull the trigger on
this and this is real.

852
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,340
This has happened.
There's a lot of people saying that's

853
00:35:04,341 --> 00:35:07,130
happening with the Tommy Robinson
protests in the UK right now.

854
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,900
See,
I don't know enough about that story

855
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:11,180
other than the fact that a bunch of
people were mad at me on twitter.

856
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,820
I'm not talking about talking about,
I was like,

857
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:15,860
I don't even know what that is.
I'm going to back away.

858
00:35:15,861 --> 00:35:17,450
And then I saw it was something about he
was,

859
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:23,200
he was filming outside of a trial of
Muslim pedophiles.

860
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:25,520
Is that what these grooming gangs?
Yeah,

861
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:26,820
grooming gangs.
Yeah.

862
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:30,260
Tell me the whole story.
So I don't want to do this as if I'm the

863
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:33,440
freaking lawyer of the whole thing,
but in effect he was filming outside of

864
00:35:33,441 --> 00:35:36,830
the trial for these,
this group of men that are raping,

865
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,070
they're to be like

866
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,890
12 and 13 year old girls.
Basically they're on trial.

867
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:44,490
He had already been on probation or
something for something else.

868
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,850
And you're not allowed to fill them
outside the courthouse.

869
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:50,460
So technically I suppose he is in jail
now for the right reasons,

870
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:53,160
but there's a lot of people that think
he's not going to survive being in jail.

871
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:54,450
And I look,
I had the guy on my show.

872
00:35:54,451 --> 00:35:55,740
Have you ever,
have you ever talked to him?

873
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,630
No,
I didn't know anything about him until

874
00:35:57,631 --> 00:35:58,920
this,
this thing happened.

875
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,070
I mean he has no,
I know.

876
00:36:02,071 --> 00:36:03,060
It's a lot.
It's all the time,

877
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:04,280
man.
No,

878
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,880
I know you shit to do.
I have kids.

879
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,700
I don't know.
You have to do occasionally just pick

880
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:10,490
one and you're like,
this one dude.

881
00:36:10,491 --> 00:36:12,000
There's a lot of them.
I just don't know.

882
00:36:12,001 --> 00:36:13,350
I don't know what's going on.
Like people who will,

883
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:14,300
how come you're not calm and going?

884
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,110
And it was like,
I don't even know about it.

885
00:36:16,111 --> 00:36:16,891
You fuck.
I know.

886
00:36:16,891 --> 00:36:17,820
I love it.
I love that.

887
00:36:17,821 --> 00:36:20,100
When you sit out something on twitter
for six hours and people started

888
00:36:20,101 --> 00:36:23,250
screaming at you like that proves or you
say anything about it.

889
00:36:23,251 --> 00:36:23,580
Yeah.
Oh,

890
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,570
you talk all day long about this and
that,

891
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,260
but then this comes up and you don't
hear a word like I didn't even hear

892
00:36:28,261 --> 00:36:29,630
about some just now.
Well,

893
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,260
all right,
let's not dive too deep in that so

894
00:36:31,261 --> 00:36:32,490
quick,
but quick on Jones though.

895
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:34,800
So I'm not actually in case you think I
am.

896
00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:36,870
I'm not giving you shit for doing it.
I'm just curious.

897
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,580
I'm just curious because I think part of
the article that that Barry Weiss wrote

898
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:45,150
in the times about us,
she was talking about that and there's a

899
00:36:45,151 --> 00:36:46,740
line in there where she said,
you know,

900
00:36:46,741 --> 00:36:50,010
if you talk to these people,
meaning Jones in Cernovich and Molyneux,

901
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,280
that you're either cynical or stupid and
in effect that was,

902
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,760
that was a shot at me and you,
it wasn't a shot at anybody else because

903
00:36:56,761 --> 00:36:58,500
they don't have to talk to other people.

904
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,510
You know what I mean?
Like I love Eric and Bret Weinstein.

905
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,880
What she said,
yeah,

906
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,770
we can probably find the line.
But it was that you'd have to,

907
00:37:04,771 --> 00:37:06,600
I think it was,
you'd have to be cynical or stupid.

908
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:07,920
I would argue that,
I mean,

909
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,260
are you against that?
Because I don't think you have to be,

910
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:12,570
they're cynical or stupid.
You just have to be a person talking to

911
00:37:12,571 --> 00:37:14,340
someone.
Just because you're talking to someone

912
00:37:14,341 --> 00:37:15,660
doesn't mean you agree with them.
Yeah.

913
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:18,600
Idea of giving someone a platform.
Like I'm going to have Ted nugent on the

914
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:19,560
podcast.
Right.

915
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,790
You obviously endorse everything he's
ever since.

916
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:22,820
That's what you're saying.
Right?

917
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,250
If you haven't gone,
that's,

918
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,950
that's the only way to look at it again.
That's it.

919
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,260
How come you can't just talk to the guy
and find out like,

920
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,750
like candace owens,
I don't agree with everything can to so

921
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,140
and so's.

922
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,790
Yeah.
Yeah.

923
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,430
And this is nothing wrong with having a
conversation like that.

924
00:37:35,431 --> 00:37:36,720
In fact,
it's illuminating.

925
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:39,510
What do you got here?
Let's find that holding up the line.

926
00:37:39,511 --> 00:37:42,610
This is from the Times piece.
Um,

927
00:37:42,611 --> 00:37:44,940
it says,
it seems to me that if you're willing to

928
00:37:44,941 --> 00:37:48,600
sit across from an Alex Jones or Mike
Cernovich and take them seriously,

929
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:51,270
there's a high probability that you're
either cynical or stupid.

930
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,310
Now,
if there's a reason for shorting the

931
00:37:53,311 --> 00:37:56,340
idw,
it's the inability of certain members to

932
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:57,990
see this as a fatal error.
So that's,

933
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,490
that's Rogan and Ruben.
That's,

934
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,670
that's what that's saying.
Yeah,

935
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,870
I get it.
I'm just definitely things you can

936
00:38:03,871 --> 00:38:05,400
criticize about me,
but,

937
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,420
um,
I have the list,

938
00:38:06,421 --> 00:38:07,440
right?
But here's the thing.

939
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,470
If you're saying I'm taking him
seriously,

940
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,920
I got Alex High and drunk and he started
talking about interdimensional,

941
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:18,450
chogm molesters.
Like if anything,

942
00:38:18,451 --> 00:38:20,220
it showed people who he really is.
Like,

943
00:38:20,221 --> 00:38:23,250
I've known that guy forever.
I've partied with that dude.

944
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,700
I've had them coming to my comedy shows.
We've gotten fucked up and ran around

945
00:38:26,701 --> 00:38:30,230
the town and went to bars together back
before everybody knew who he was too.

946
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,640
We could go places.
He's a fun guy.

947
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,830
I don't believe everything he believes.
I think he's silly

948
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,470
and a lot of ways,
but I like a lot of people that I don't

949
00:38:39,471 --> 00:38:41,510
agree with.
I don't have to agree with them.

950
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,970
I didn't know about his Sandy Hook
denial.

951
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,130
If I did,
it would have been the first thing I

952
00:38:46,131 --> 00:38:50,810
pressed him on when I talked to him.
I wanted to do it with my crazy friend

953
00:38:50,811 --> 00:38:54,020
Eddie Bravo cause he believes every
fucking conspiracy theory and I wanted

954
00:38:54,021 --> 00:38:57,620
to get him with Alex together and it was
the cluster fuck that I hoped it would

955
00:38:57,621 --> 00:39:00,560
be it.
It was a good thing about it is it

956
00:39:00,561 --> 00:39:04,640
showed people who Alex really is.
It showed a side of him that you just

957
00:39:04,641 --> 00:39:09,641
don't get from his info wars show.
You get to see him hi and laughing and

958
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:12,860
drunk and pounded whiskey and fucking
around and people are like,

959
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,550
oh I could see why you like that guy.
I can see why he's fun.

960
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:19,940
We had a good time together.
That doesn't mean I endorse his opinions

961
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,460
on things.
And the idea that this is only red or

962
00:39:22,461 --> 00:39:24,380
white,
that it is one or zero.

963
00:39:24,381 --> 00:39:26,180
It's binary.
That's ridiculous.

964
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:27,920
That's ridiculous.
I just didn't,

965
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:31,910
those two choices of adjectives I just
thought were slightly like you could say

966
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,230
defending our position,
I think.

967
00:39:33,231 --> 00:39:36,170
I think she's doing a smart thing
because she's a writer for the New York

968
00:39:36,171 --> 00:39:38,960
Times.
I do have a lot of ridiculous people on

969
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:40,620
and you have had ridiculous people on
too.

970
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,180
So what she's saying makes sense if you
take them seriously.

971
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:46,520
But she left that caveat.
If you take them seriously.

972
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:50,600
I do not take Alex Jones his opinion on
interdimensional child molesters.

973
00:39:50,601 --> 00:39:52,990
Seriously,
I don't his opinion,

974
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:56,510
I don't want to smoke pot once a year
just to test to see what George Soros

975
00:39:56,511 --> 00:40:00,110
has done with the marijuana.
George Soros is giving the marijuana

976
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,230
fucking dosage recommendations.
Like that's pretty sure.

977
00:40:03,231 --> 00:40:04,940
Roseanne told me that too.
Well,

978
00:40:04,941 --> 00:40:07,940
she thinks that that's another thing.
I don't know what to do with her now.

979
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,140
She thinks she apologized for that,
but she said George Soros was a Nazi or

980
00:40:12,141 --> 00:40:15,920
something.
He was captured by the Nazis.

981
00:40:15,921 --> 00:40:17,820
I mean he was like,
okay,

982
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:19,521
well anyway,
this,

983
00:40:19,521 --> 00:40:22,160
this gate piracies this gate keeping
thing.

984
00:40:22,161 --> 00:40:24,860
I just think it's,
it's interesting because if we're going

985
00:40:24,861 --> 00:40:27,830
to do what we do well at whatever level
we do it,

986
00:40:27,831 --> 00:40:30,590
it's like we're going to have to talk to
people that people don't like.

987
00:40:30,591 --> 00:40:31,610
And listen,
look,

988
00:40:31,611 --> 00:40:33,170
Larry King,
and this is the one thing I always say,

989
00:40:33,171 --> 00:40:34,870
it's like Larry King in the,
in his heyday,

990
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,920
think of the Prime Larry King,
right?

991
00:40:36,921 --> 00:40:40,400
So 1991,
CNN prime time,

992
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,380
he could have,
you know,

993
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,420
uh,
the Oj Simpson lawyers on,

994
00:40:44,421 --> 00:40:46,760
on Monday,
he could have the cast show Seinfeld on

995
00:40:46,761 --> 00:40:49,640
Tuesday.
He could have a magician on Wednesday.

996
00:40:49,641 --> 00:40:52,580
He could have Lucille ball if she was
still alive on Thursday.

997
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:53,900
And then,
you know,

998
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,940
George,
the secretary of state or something.

999
00:40:55,941 --> 00:40:59,740
So no one thought he endorsed all of
those ideas or I was friends with all

1000
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,220
those people.
But I think somehow now,

1001
00:41:01,221 --> 00:41:04,070
because,
because this feels like your home.

1002
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,220
Mine is actually in my home the way we
are.

1003
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:08,600
We're different,
we're friendlier.

1004
00:41:08,601 --> 00:41:13,430
We're not sitting here with note cards
and with I fbs and it doesn't feel all

1005
00:41:13,431 --> 00:41:17,580
produced and planned and all that.
Even though I think we both do a hell of

1006
00:41:17,581 --> 00:41:20,580
a fucking professional show that I think
we're both really proud of.

1007
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,800
Um,
I think because of that,

1008
00:41:22,801 --> 00:41:23,634
they think,

1009
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,733
ah,

1010
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:27,670
now you're seeing the real them or
something like that.

1011
00:41:27,671 --> 00:41:29,440
Like it's a,
it's something that I'm looking for Shit

1012
00:41:29,441 --> 00:41:30,580
to complain about.
Listen,

1013
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:31,750
I might be the easiest,
right?

1014
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:33,980
One of the reasons why I decided to do a
podcast in the

1015
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,620
first place cause I wanted to be able to
do whatever I wanted.

1016
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:38,270
I wanted to be able to talk to my
friends,

1017
00:41:38,271 --> 00:41:41,540
have a good time fuck around.
Along the line it became something

1018
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:44,030
different.
And along the line it became not just

1019
00:41:44,031 --> 00:41:47,060
talking to my friends,
it became talking to people that are

1020
00:41:47,061 --> 00:41:51,230
famous are interesting people or
professors or writers or whoever it is.

1021
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:54,600
And I'm going to do whatever the fuck I
want and that's why I'm doing this.

1022
00:41:54,601 --> 00:41:56,520
I'm going to do whatever the fuck I want
if I want to talk to.

1023
00:41:56,521 --> 00:41:57,960
And if you don't like who I'm talking
to,

1024
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:01,200
it's super simple.
You just don't listen to that episode

1025
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:03,570
and go load rogen.
You're all right now.

1026
00:42:03,571 --> 00:42:06,060
All you have is alt right people.
You think you're balanced up cause you

1027
00:42:06,061 --> 00:42:09,990
have abby Martin on once a year.
Like I just think I talked to people,

1028
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,240
you know I,
I talked to a lot of people.

1029
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:14,040
There's,
I like talking to people.

1030
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:17,880
I like talking to people I agree with
and I can usually talk to people.

1031
00:42:17,881 --> 00:42:19,770
I disagree with them.
I get something out of that too.

1032
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,830
Yeah.
How,

1033
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:24,760
how aware are you of the thing that you
just said there that like you did

1034
00:42:24,761 --> 00:42:28,000
exactly what you set out to do.
I don't know that you fully set out to

1035
00:42:28,001 --> 00:42:30,490
do it this way,
but you did it like this thing that you

1036
00:42:30,491 --> 00:42:33,760
have created is so it,
it is so what you wanted to do,

1037
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:37,140
whether you fully got it or not,
but like you created it,

1038
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:38,410
it's awesome.
Like I'm,

1039
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,140
I'm doing it at a,
I think a lower level than you are,

1040
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:45,190
but I'm very aware of that.
That like I somehow I hated what the

1041
00:42:45,191 --> 00:42:49,180
system was offering and I was like,
I gotta do something that feels right

1042
00:42:49,181 --> 00:42:51,570
for me and from a different place.
Did it?

1043
00:42:51,571 --> 00:42:51,690
Yeah.

1044
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:54,000
Cause I didn't come at it from a place
like I need a Gig.

1045
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:56,280
I came at it from a place like,
oh that'd be fun.

1046
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,233
Yeah.
Fuck around.

1047
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,540
All the other side of things.
I mean,

1048
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:03,600
I was already a professional stand up.
I was already the commentator for the

1049
00:43:03,601 --> 00:43:05,820
UFC.
So this wasn't like when I came,

1050
00:43:05,821 --> 00:43:10,590
I mean I did it for years for zero money
for years because I just did it for fun.

1051
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:13,290
Like literally for fun dude,
once a week have fun,

1052
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:15,990
sit down and have some comics over wood,
smoke some pot,

1053
00:43:15,991 --> 00:43:16,830
talk,
some shit,

1054
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,850
have a couple of laughs.
And then next thing you know I've got

1055
00:43:20,851 --> 00:43:25,110
Graham Hancock on and you know,
next thing you know I've got bordain on

1056
00:43:25,111 --> 00:43:26,190
and I've got,
you know,

1057
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:31,140
this professor and this author and the,
and then it got weirder and weirder.

1058
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:33,960
But it just,
to me it's just what's interesting.

1059
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,560
Talk to people and I've never looked at
it like,

1060
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,610
mmm.
Like,

1061
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:43,060
like there's anything I have to do.
I've never looked at it like that.

1062
00:43:43,061 --> 00:43:43,960
I've,
I've just always like,

1063
00:43:43,961 --> 00:43:46,330
well this would be cool.
Oh that guy sounds cool.

1064
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,340
Let me get him.
This guy might be interesting.

1065
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,600
Oh,
I like to talk to that dude.

1066
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,890
I want to find out about sleep.
I want to find out about exercise and

1067
00:43:52,891 --> 00:43:55,240
want to find out about dying.
I want to find out about like,

1068
00:43:55,241 --> 00:43:58,150
well how the fuck this finance is really
where I want to talk to Peter Shift.

1069
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,350
Tell me how this works.
How do you,

1070
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:00,910
what do you do well,
how do you,

1071
00:44:00,911 --> 00:44:02,410
how are you making your money?
Like what it,

1072
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:04,480
what the fuck is going on in Puerto
Rico?

1073
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:05,350
I this,
this,

1074
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:07,090
I love talking to people,
man.

1075
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,560
I,
it's a fascinating thing to just to pick

1076
00:44:10,561 --> 00:44:14,610
the brain uninterrupted with no
distractions,

1077
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,920
to sit down and talk to someone for
hours at a time.

1078
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,200
You learned a lot about yourself.
You learn.

1079
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,360
Conversely,
I'm much better,

1080
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,800
much better at talking to people and
being sensitive and open minded and

1081
00:44:25,801 --> 00:44:29,700
being considerate and listening.
And that's a big thing.

1082
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:32,070
Like listening and communicating people,
not just waiting

1083
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,590
for my time to talk,
but communicating with people.

1084
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:37,860
It's like,
I feel like conversation is a lost art

1085
00:44:37,861 --> 00:44:42,861
with a lot of folks and I've gotten way,
way better at it over the whatever many

1086
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:45,180
years,
nine years,

1087
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,340
nine years of doing this show.
Yeah,

1088
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,280
I'm with,
yeah,

1089
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,900
I mean I hear you all.
I mean,

1090
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:52,050
I said at the beginning,
but I just am doing what I think is

1091
00:44:52,051 --> 00:44:52,590
right.
Yeah,

1092
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:56,790
it's fun tactic.
That's why when I see like the barrage

1093
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:59,070
of hate that I'll get online for this or
that or just,

1094
00:44:59,071 --> 00:44:59,881
you know,
it's the same thing.

1095
00:44:59,881 --> 00:45:01,250
It's just these people that just
endless.

1096
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:02,910
You want to hate on everything and all
that.

1097
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,170
It's too much noise.
Oh,

1098
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,840
it's like if you're spending all day
long hating on me,

1099
00:45:06,841 --> 00:45:09,480
like if anything what I'm doing and he's
the real problem here.

1100
00:45:09,481 --> 00:45:11,370
You know what I mean?
Like let's say I'm wrong on everything I

1101
00:45:11,371 --> 00:45:12,750
say.
Everything I said for the first 10

1102
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:15,330
minutes about politics is wrong and we
should have strong federal government

1103
00:45:15,331 --> 00:45:17,580
and identity politics like even if that
is,

1104
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:19,650
that's how it,
it really is.

1105
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:23,000
Am I really the biggest problem here
that people are all day long devoting

1106
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:25,260
twitter accounts,
people that make accounts all day wrong.

1107
00:45:25,261 --> 00:45:27,070
Fuck Dave room and Dave Rubin socks,
Bro.

1108
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,610
I was like,
what are you doing?

1109
00:45:28,611 --> 00:45:29,850
Is that going on all the time?

1110
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,800
People get laid anymore.
I should know that that's happening.

1111
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:36,190
That's the part of the problem is
you're,

1112
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:38,610
you're sort of indulging it,
but paying attention to it.

1113
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,860
There's just too many people paying way
less attention.

1114
00:45:40,861 --> 00:45:41,640
Yeah.
That's good.

1115
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,590
Yeah.
You can't pay attention at all,

1116
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,590
dude.
I was in a sensory deprivation tank just

1117
00:45:46,591 --> 00:45:47,460
two,
three days ago.

1118
00:45:47,461 --> 00:45:49,170
Thanks to you.
I've been doing it more.

1119
00:45:49,171 --> 00:45:51,120
I was just in one of these infrared
saunas.

1120
00:45:51,121 --> 00:45:51,870
I'm doing it,
you know,

1121
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:54,510
I'm doing all my August off the grid.
I did it last August.

1122
00:45:54,511 --> 00:45:57,030
Just literally nothing.
I locked my phone in a safe,

1123
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,880
really locked my phone in a safe for 30
days.

1124
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,380
Do you call it the TV?
No,

1125
00:46:01,381 --> 00:46:06,280
nothing off the grid.
August we had some Ruben Ruben esque

1126
00:46:06,281 --> 00:46:08,400
something or other yellow dog.
It's something like that,

1127
00:46:08,401 --> 00:46:09,570
but I'm going to do it for now on.

1128
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:11,290
I'm doing that every August.
Really?

1129
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,170
Yeah.
I am completely shutting down.

1130
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:15,420
Uh,
I'm working on this book that I started

1131
00:46:15,421 --> 00:46:17,850
last August and then,
and then of course the year gets so

1132
00:46:17,851 --> 00:46:19,620
crazy,
but I have to pick it up again in

1133
00:46:19,621 --> 00:46:20,880
August.
I've been writing it now while I'm on

1134
00:46:20,881 --> 00:46:21,990
the road.
What's the book about?

1135
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,390
I mean,
I don't want to go too far in it,

1136
00:46:24,391 --> 00:46:26,670
but it in effect,
it's when I did that prager u video

1137
00:46:26,671 --> 00:46:29,490
about why I left the left.
That's sort of the genesis of it,

1138
00:46:29,491 --> 00:46:31,680
of sort of giving people a little bit of
a roadmap.

1139
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:33,680
What does the prager u video,
I'm not aware of it.

1140
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,160
So you're,
you're familiar with pay for you,

1141
00:46:35,161 --> 00:46:36,540
right?
Well Dennis Prager,

1142
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:38,510
super conservative fellow.
Yeah.

1143
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,000
So he does,
he has this online university where they

1144
00:46:42,001 --> 00:46:45,840
do these five minute cartoon videos on
different ideas and they'll do on

1145
00:46:45,841 --> 00:46:48,780
economics and foreign policy and race
and religion,

1146
00:46:48,781 --> 00:46:49,411
et Cetera,
et Cetera,

1147
00:46:49,411 --> 00:46:50,244
et cetera.

1148
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,820
And so I did one,
it was a bout a year and a half ago,

1149
00:46:53,821 --> 00:46:56,100
February of last year called,
well,

1150
00:46:56,101 --> 00:46:58,470
I had actually never said the phrase why
I left the left,

1151
00:46:58,471 --> 00:47:01,860
but I just talked about my frustrations
with the left and why I believe in

1152
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:06,861
freedom and in liberty they titled It,
why I left the left and it's chilly.

1153
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:09,840
The first,
the first half hour when it dropped,

1154
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,750
I was pissed because I was like,
man,

1155
00:47:12,751 --> 00:47:16,530
did they just like blow my gig?
Like I really felt at that time,

1156
00:47:16,531 --> 00:47:20,220
I feel a little differently now that I
was trying to fix the left from within

1157
00:47:20,221 --> 00:47:23,580
or at least have conversations as
someone that was one of these people.

1158
00:47:23,581 --> 00:47:25,260
Like that's why I was focusing on the
left.

1159
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,750
The all these liberals were,
were my people.

1160
00:47:27,751 --> 00:47:29,950
This is the thing that I grew up in.
I always believed in.

1161
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,200
So the fact that they did that first
half hour,

1162
00:47:32,201 --> 00:47:33,070
I was like,
fuck,

1163
00:47:33,071 --> 00:47:35,320
like did I just get booted out?

1164
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,540
And then quickly I realized that video
went,

1165
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,000
went so viral,
it's their number one viewed video on

1166
00:47:40,001 --> 00:47:42,130
youtube that I was like,
you know what,

1167
00:47:42,131 --> 00:47:44,450
I have to just kind of embrace this.
And,

1168
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,880
and again,
it goes back to the labels thing.

1169
00:47:45,881 --> 00:47:48,590
It doesn't really matter whether you
left the three,

1170
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,190
whether you're a libertarian or
classical liberal of the rest of it.

1171
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:53,230
Um,
but anyway,

1172
00:47:53,231 --> 00:47:57,010
that's the genesis of the book of like
just how do you escape this sort of

1173
00:47:57,011 --> 00:48:02,011
monolithic totalitarian thinking and how
do you just be whoever you are and how

1174
00:48:03,191 --> 00:48:05,860
does that,
how does being an individual basically

1175
00:48:05,861 --> 00:48:08,680
lead you to being happy?
Because I think that's actually the only

1176
00:48:08,681 --> 00:48:11,200
way that you can be happy.
I think that that's it.

1177
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,230
You have,
you know,

1178
00:48:12,231 --> 00:48:15,250
it's the most cliche thing ever.
It's what Peterson's telling these

1179
00:48:15,251 --> 00:48:18,070
people every night,
the thousands and thousands and

1180
00:48:18,071 --> 00:48:21,790
thousands of people are showing up every
night and he talks about the individual,

1181
00:48:21,791 --> 00:48:23,950
he talks about stand up straight,
you know,

1182
00:48:23,951 --> 00:48:24,790
clean your room.

1183
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:29,170
Like these things all sound silly at
some level and the more that I'm with

1184
00:48:29,171 --> 00:48:32,230
the guy,
it's like he's giving these people

1185
00:48:32,231 --> 00:48:35,170
saying that has just been so lost.
Like so.

1186
00:48:35,171 --> 00:48:38,170
Absolutely lost.
People think you can just be pathetic.

1187
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,090
Blame the system.
Everything else.

1188
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:42,790
It's somebody else's fault.
You should be given shit.

1189
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:46,510
All of this stuff.
And it's like ethic about every movie,

1190
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:48,820
any movie,
whatever your 10 favorite movies are.

1191
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,590
Is it about a guy who just was like,
oh,

1192
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:53,220
the world sucks and what the fuck am I
going to do on somebody?

1193
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:54,670
It's somebody else's fault.
No,

1194
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:57,010
every great movie,
whatever.

1195
00:48:57,030 --> 00:49:01,240
You guys got a problem and guess what he
does solves the problem and that's what

1196
00:49:01,241 --> 00:49:02,890
you're supposed to do.
And this is an adventure.

1197
00:49:02,891 --> 00:49:03,880
This,
this life.

1198
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,480
But when you mean the individual like
being an individual is the only way to

1199
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:08,860
be happy.
What do you mean by that?

1200
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:10,001
That,
well,

1201
00:49:10,001 --> 00:49:12,700
first off that we should only be judged
as individuals.

1202
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:14,680
That's it.
So remove all the immutable

1203
00:49:14,681 --> 00:49:15,940
characteristics.
I'm gay,

1204
00:49:15,941 --> 00:49:16,631
big dam.
What?

1205
00:49:16,631 --> 00:49:19,180
But you got any specific questions for
me on that big dam?

1206
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:20,023
Whoop.

1207
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,200
I was that big dam.
Right?

1208
00:49:23,201 --> 00:49:24,910
But like you know,
like that,

1209
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:30,480
just saying that means nothing other
than you can figure out who I sleep

1210
00:49:30,941 --> 00:49:31,330
with.
Right,

1211
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:32,163
right.
Okay.

1212
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:35,560
That's it.
All we can do is judge people as

1213
00:49:35,561 --> 00:49:39,070
individuals and you have to just figure
out what is right for you.

1214
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,950
So for all the people that I disagree
with that are sort of like big

1215
00:49:41,951 --> 00:49:44,170
government lefties and blah blah,
and I get why that unique,

1216
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,600
maybe need a little more of that.
If you live in a big city where you

1217
00:49:46,601 --> 00:49:49,450
might need more noise regulations than
if you lived in the freaking,

1218
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:51,760
if you live in the middle of Idaho on a
farm or whatever,

1219
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,920
it's like if that's the life that you
want to live,

1220
00:49:53,921 --> 00:49:56,710
then fight for that.
But what we're doing now is this

1221
00:49:56,711 --> 00:50:00,910
collective is craziness,
is causing people to be unable to think

1222
00:50:00,911 --> 00:50:01,390
clearly.

1223
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:05,350
So like Huffington post yesterday wrote
a thing about how you have to choose

1224
00:50:05,351 --> 00:50:09,220
between being for gay people are I said
I think it was for queer people or for

1225
00:50:09,221 --> 00:50:12,130
chick filet.
Now I happened to be the peers because

1226
00:50:12,131 --> 00:50:15,610
of Jack.
Cause Jack got in trouble or he's tweet

1227
00:50:15,611 --> 00:50:18,400
about chick filet and it was like you
have a tweet about chick filet.

1228
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:18,911
He,
yeah,

1229
00:50:18,911 --> 00:50:21,760
cause he tweeted that he,
he showed like a digital receipt that he

1230
00:50:21,761 --> 00:50:24,160
bought chick filet and then solar.
That O'brian was like,

1231
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:27,950
you tweeted that on gay pride month and
it's like endless.

1232
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,950
But why would he tweet of a chick filet
receipt?

1233
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,320
Who the hell knows?
The guy likes chicken fillet.

1234
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:35,960
Who Cares?
We're not allowed to like it.

1235
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:38,830
Yeah,
you better not like chick fil a chick

1236
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,420
fil A.
I took a picture yesterday,

1237
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:44,220
there was a chick filet next door to,
uh,

1238
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,490
to the theater we were at.
I took a picture of chick ballet there

1239
00:50:46,491 --> 00:50:48,620
and I tweeted out the thing and it's
like,

1240
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,890
I like chicken sandwiches.
Every time I've gone into a chick fil a

1241
00:50:51,891 --> 00:50:54,830
that people are going to find me one
fast food restaurant.

1242
00:50:54,831 --> 00:50:56,730
Is that so that,
so that's what he did.

1243
00:50:57,510 --> 00:50:59,240
Oh,
it's the cash app.

1244
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:02,290
That's one of our sponsors.
You're 10% boosted.

1245
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:07,310
Chick-Filet was applied.
You were charged 28 43 chick-filet ah,

1246
00:51:08,301 --> 00:51:13,301
he dared and leave 10% on gay pride.
He wrote boost and then he tagged

1247
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,090
chick-filet.
Hmm.

1248
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,440
And Soledad O'brien showed who's I
showed him who his loss.

1249
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:22,940
But that's what I'm saying,
that that sort of this endless guilting

1250
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:25,550
and,
and you know you do this,

1251
00:51:25,551 --> 00:51:29,960
so your eval it,
it's ruining the fabric of society.

1252
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,700
It really is.
Eat Chicken.

1253
00:51:31,701 --> 00:51:34,040
If you like chicken,
don't eat it if you don't like it.

1254
00:51:34,041 --> 00:51:36,890
But that's what individualism is about.
If you want to make the choice,

1255
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,650
if you think that whatever chick-filet
is doing to gay people,

1256
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,250
whatever they're secretly doing,
it gave live.

1257
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:42,410
You think that's so evil.
Even though,

1258
00:51:42,411 --> 00:51:44,690
by the way,
during the pulse nightclub shooting at

1259
00:51:44,691 --> 00:51:47,510
the gay club in Florida,
when 51 people were killed,

1260
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:51,260
they gave free food to everybody.
But if you think they hate gay people

1261
00:51:51,261 --> 00:51:53,000
that much,
then don't shop there.

1262
00:51:53,001 --> 00:51:57,230
But you don't have to harangue everybody
else into doing everything that you want

1263
00:51:57,231 --> 00:51:59,780
them to do.
That's actually the reverse of freedom,

1264
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:01,550
you know,
live and let live that.

1265
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:05,900
That's why I believe I could see people,
if they're saying that chick filet is a

1266
00:52:05,901 --> 00:52:08,900
homophobic institution that that you
shouldn't endorse.

1267
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:11,330
Chick-Filet is particularly if you're a
gay man,

1268
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,840
but what does that mean?
I go into chip Jay,

1269
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:16,790
not that I know of.
Okay,

1270
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:19,760
so it's not that that seemed weird.
I don't like to,

1271
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:24,770
I don't know either.
But he clearly is an influencer and I

1272
00:52:25,281 --> 00:52:28,680
think that the cash app,
if I had to gas,

1273
00:52:28,681 --> 00:52:31,490
because they sponsored this podcast,
they're very active in sponsoring

1274
00:52:31,491 --> 00:52:34,550
podcasts.
They probably have some sort of an

1275
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:37,340
endorsement deal with him,
which is why he did that.

1276
00:52:37,341 --> 00:52:39,920
So it was a financial thing for the cash
app,

1277
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,170
if I want to guess.
All right,

1278
00:52:42,171 --> 00:52:43,610
so we don't know about that
specifically,

1279
00:52:43,611 --> 00:52:45,860
but if they were paying him to do it,
I mean that's for him.

1280
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:48,170
That's again,
that's for him as an individual to

1281
00:52:48,171 --> 00:52:50,600
decide,
I am going to say pride month is this

1282
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,280
month,
this month,

1283
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,930
this is the gay as month there is dam
and I'm here with you.

1284
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:57,070
Hello.
This is the gay as they come into all of

1285
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,190
June.
All right.

1286
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:58,791
Yeah,
June.

1287
00:52:58,791 --> 00:53:01,400
It's very gay.
But that's what I'm saying like how many

1288
00:53:01,401 --> 00:53:03,500
people were upset,
how many pieces but,

1289
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:06,110
but it goes exactly to where we started
with this whole thing.

1290
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:10,340
There is this loud group of people and
most of them have some sort of odd

1291
00:53:10,341 --> 00:53:12,830
influencing media.
They're all of these blue check,

1292
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:15,610
buzzfeed,
4,000 twitter follower people then

1293
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:19,040
retweet all of the articles of the
people like them at Salon in box and

1294
00:53:19,041 --> 00:53:22,040
buzzfeed and then in that,
and they make it seem like we're all

1295
00:53:22,041 --> 00:53:23,540
hysterical,
crazy people.

1296
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:26,040
And I simply don't believe that,
believe that most

1297
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,230
people,
I would say the vast majority of people

1298
00:53:28,231 --> 00:53:30,900
probably,
I mean I think it's something crazy like

1299
00:53:30,901 --> 00:53:34,470
80% of people I think are good,
decent people who just want people to

1300
00:53:34,471 --> 00:53:35,520
live.
They want,

1301
00:53:35,521 --> 00:53:38,130
you can fuck who you want to fuck.
You can smoke what you want to smoke.

1302
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:40,710
You can't do it on my property.
You can't take what's mine.

1303
00:53:40,711 --> 00:53:45,090
You can't force me to bake a cake or do
any of those things.

1304
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:48,150
But you can allow people to live as they
see fit.

1305
00:53:48,151 --> 00:53:51,150
I think that's what most people are and
that's why there's such a push back.

1306
00:53:51,151 --> 00:53:54,030
That's the answer to the Peterson.
Peterson said,

1307
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:57,150
I'm not going to use pronouns that the
government forces me to use.

1308
00:53:57,690 --> 00:53:58,830
That's all.
That's what put him on the,

1309
00:53:58,831 --> 00:54:01,590
that it's all sold.
I mean there's so many of them.

1310
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:03,310
They got so silly with that,
that it,

1311
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,550
it,
it made sense that someone was pushing

1312
00:54:05,551 --> 00:54:08,080
back to 78 different gender pronouns.

1313
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:10,530
And you're obviously dealing with people
that are being silly.

1314
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:13,580
This is not like there's,
it's not just people being silly.

1315
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,130
You remember when ms came along,
there was miss and there was messages

1316
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:19,080
and when was that?
What year was that?

1317
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:21,660
I was a kid.
I remember being super confused.

1318
00:54:21,661 --> 00:54:22,140
I'm like,
dammit,

1319
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,580
a new thing.
You know,

1320
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,680
what's the matter?
He's the CEO of that company too.

1321
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:27,250
Who Is Jack?
Yeah.

1322
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:28,181
Of Cash App.
Oh,

1323
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:31,720
he's the
advertising has company.

1324
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:34,530
Oh,
well that makes total sense.

1325
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:35,880
Makes total sense.
Yeah.

1326
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,090
Okay.
Oh,

1327
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:39,120
there you go.
Um,

1328
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:42,480
I just think that,
well that's a tricky one.

1329
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:43,980
That's,
that's different.

1330
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,800
Well look,
he's a guy promoting something on one of

1331
00:54:46,801 --> 00:54:51,120
the things that he owns and he,
but he's doing it on gay pride month.

1332
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,370
Who Cares?
I mean,

1333
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:58,230
really like it just so,
so what is it that they,

1334
00:54:58,231 --> 00:55:00,960
so I guess at one point they were
against gay marriage and maybe they

1335
00:55:00,961 --> 00:55:01,650
still are now.

1336
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:04,560
Who knows what every cut.
Think of all of us not to late CEO.

1337
00:55:04,561 --> 00:55:07,760
Isn't the CEO dead?
I think the CEO that was like super,

1338
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,890
I think it is the,
the original guy in his honor.

1339
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:13,470
His wishes though and keep it close on
Sunday still.

1340
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,600
You know what?
Every time I do,

1341
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:16,080
but it's fuck,
cause I want a chicken sandwich on

1342
00:55:16,081 --> 00:55:17,040
Sunday.
Yeah.

1343
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:22,140
So somebody should be opening that.
Somebody should be opening the Sunday

1344
00:55:22,141 --> 00:55:23,970
chicken sandwich.
Not In pro gay,

1345
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:26,820
not in June.
Solidarity to my gay brothers and

1346
00:55:26,821 --> 00:55:28,710
sisters.
It's all so stupid.

1347
00:55:28,711 --> 00:55:30,540
Eat a sandwich if you want a sandwich.
Don't,

1348
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:33,260
every time I've gotten into chick ballet
when you've got it play,

1349
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:35,220
are they nicer?
Not just when been there.

1350
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:37,260
Literally twice.
And are they nice?

1351
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,550
I don't remember.
They're nobody.

1352
00:55:38,551 --> 00:55:40,020
They're friendly.
They're friendly.

1353
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:41,720
They don't look yelled at me for things.

1354
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:42,910
Okay.
Yeah.

1355
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:44,190
Yeah.
I don't know ma'am.

1356
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:46,640
I just don't think that,
uh,

1357
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:50,430
I don't think there's that much outrage.
I think there's a business in outrage

1358
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:51,930
though,
and there's certainly a business in a

1359
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:55,950
lot of people that write these articles.
And the Jordan Peterson thing has been

1360
00:55:55,951 --> 00:55:59,280
very illuminating to me because I've
watched them misrepresent his positions

1361
00:55:59,281 --> 00:56:02,940
on so many different things and call him
so many horrible names,

1362
00:56:02,941 --> 00:56:04,350
transphobic,
racist,

1363
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:06,400
all right.
All these different things and,

1364
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,980
and do so with,
you know,

1365
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:11,370
with no justification or
rationalization.

1366
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:13,560
Like you look at the actual article and
they don't,

1367
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:16,110
they don't post to what he actually
said.

1368
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:17,700
It's like that woman in the,
uh,

1369
00:56:17,701 --> 00:56:20,040
the munk debates.
What was it called?

1370
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,180
Oh yeah.
What was it called?

1371
00:56:21,181 --> 00:56:21,770
The monk debate.
Yeah.

1372
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:22,950
Yeah.
Um,

1373
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,070
whoever that woman was

1374
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:26,110
Goldberg,
I think whatever.

1375
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:28,780
Amen.
It was her and Eric a dyson.

1376
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:29,920
Yeah.
When she said,

1377
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,050
you know,
that he doesn't want her to,

1378
00:56:32,051 --> 00:56:34,690
where he doesn't think she should be
able to wear makeup at work.

1379
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:35,730
And he's like,
I never said that.

1380
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:36,910
Well,
you can google it.

1381
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,013
Well,
we can.

1382
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:40,120
We can google it.
We can find out.

1383
00:56:40,121 --> 00:56:42,220
You made me Google something that you
were wrong about.

1384
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,780
That's,
that's upsetting to me.

1385
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,940
I don't want you to do that.
You know,

1386
00:56:45,941 --> 00:56:49,000
that bothers me more than anything.
That is dishonest.

1387
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:51,190
It's a hundred percent dishonest.
She knew.

1388
00:56:51,191 --> 00:56:56,191
He did not say that if they were,
he was having an intellectual exercise

1389
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:59,290
with an interviewer and it's,
I think one of the things that's gotten

1390
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:03,850
him into trouble is his openness to
discuss things with question mark.

1391
00:57:03,851 --> 00:57:05,500
Just bad.
I don't question marks.

1392
00:57:05,501 --> 00:57:07,870
I don't know.
I don't know if we can work together.

1393
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:10,300
We've only been doing it for 40 years.
I don't know.

1394
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:12,640
Why do women wear makeup in the
workplace?

1395
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,430
Why do women wear short skirts and high
heels?

1396
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:18,190
Why do they,
I don't think he's saying you can't do

1397
00:57:18,191 --> 00:57:19,540
that or you shouldn't be able to do
that.

1398
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:22,390
He's saying why?
He's saying that there's obvious

1399
00:57:22,391 --> 00:57:25,780
realities and when you turn on CNN,
why is it that Jake Tapper,

1400
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:28,270
Anderson Cooper,
Wolf Blitzer and the rest of the men are

1401
00:57:28,271 --> 00:57:30,400
all in suits.
They dress exactly the same.

1402
00:57:30,401 --> 00:57:33,090
Andersons are a little more tailored,
but everybody just say,

1403
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,550
what are the women all wear every single
woman dresses.

1404
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:38,620
They all wear dresses with cutoff
sleeves.

1405
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,180
That right there all sprayed 10 they all
have gorgeous hair,

1406
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:42,851
lipstick,
blah,

1407
00:57:42,851 --> 00:57:43,684
blah,
blah.

1408
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:45,340
Why is it Wolf Blitzer walking in there
with the,

1409
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:49,060
which we're going to have to cut off.
I would look like Netflix special.

1410
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:52,930
I have a whole bit about it.
About women on Fox News versus men on

1411
00:57:52,931 --> 00:57:55,240
Fox who's watching it with the sound off
smoking pot.

1412
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:59,620
Some sort of a wild life show.
It's something very strange.

1413
00:57:59,621 --> 00:58:01,540
It's a weird cultural dance that we're
doing,

1414
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,330
right?
So the idea that Jordan's talking about

1415
00:58:04,331 --> 00:58:06,310
this,
that men and women dressed differently,

1416
00:58:06,311 --> 00:58:10,630
women put on lipstick to look tracted
why do you work out Joe Rogan?

1417
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,600
Uh,
cause I don't tell people I don't want

1418
00:58:13,601 --> 00:58:15,350
to buy now be angry.
So number one,

1419
00:58:15,351 --> 00:58:16,690
so you don't kill people.
But number two,

1420
00:58:16,691 --> 00:58:18,340
you want to look good.
You want to feel good,

1421
00:58:18,341 --> 00:58:22,000
you want to be in a body that you want
to look good for your wife and blah,

1422
00:58:22,001 --> 00:58:22,271
blah,
blah.

1423
00:58:22,271 --> 00:58:26,800
And you want to live long like the,
to deny these realities all the time and

1424
00:58:26,801 --> 00:58:29,830
to think that that's because of your
toxic masculinity and all of this

1425
00:58:29,831 --> 00:58:30,250
nonsense.

1426
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:33,310
I agree that it is a loud minority,
but what I,

1427
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,640
what I think maybe where we're having a
little difference is that I think this

1428
00:58:36,641 --> 00:58:40,780
thing has spread in a way.
It is so easy to believe this nonsense,

1429
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:45,990
this abject drivel that it is.
It is infecting young people at an

1430
00:58:46,151 --> 00:58:47,500
alarming rate.
But by the way,

1431
00:58:47,501 --> 00:58:49,900
there's a lot of hopeful signs on this
cause now they're doing all these

1432
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:52,420
studies that the generation right after
millennials.

1433
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:55,620
So the kids that are like,
you know like 15 now that they're

1434
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:59,680
actually more conservative now because
they see all this as absolute hysteria.

1435
00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:02,110
So I think there is,
we are getting like a little bit of a

1436
00:59:02,111 --> 00:59:06,160
rubber band effect on this thing and I
think things are shifting into normalcy

1437
00:59:06,161 --> 00:59:09,840
and that's why people are listening to
your show and listening to Sam's podcast

1438
00:59:09,841 --> 00:59:12,490
and everything else.
I think there's an issue with people

1439
00:59:12,491 --> 00:59:17,491
commenting on things that other people
were saying and just sort of jumping in

1440
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:22,250
and not having the other person there to
discuss these subjects

1441
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:25,100
with it.
Particularly like why do women wear

1442
00:59:25,101 --> 00:59:28,430
makeup at work?
Why do women dress the way they dress?

1443
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,970
I think if you sat,
if you were sitting down with Jordan

1444
00:59:31,971 --> 00:59:35,210
talking about it,
he's willing to engage in these subjects

1445
00:59:35,211 --> 00:59:38,210
with a very,
very broad canvas.

1446
00:59:38,211 --> 00:59:40,550
I mean,
he's willing to look at all the various

1447
00:59:40,551 --> 00:59:44,120
aspects of them because as a legitimate
intellectual,

1448
00:59:44,121 --> 00:59:46,940
that's what he's doing.
It's an intellectual exercise in

1449
00:59:46,941 --> 00:59:51,740
discussion of cultural norms.
Like why do women wear the shoes where

1450
00:59:51,741 --> 00:59:54,920
you can see their toes in the,
in the workplace.

1451
00:59:54,921 --> 00:59:56,810
Whereas if a guy showed up with flip
flops on,

1452
00:59:56,811 --> 00:59:57,644
you're like,
Mike,

1453
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:00,530
the fuck we're at work here.
Get outta here with this bullshit

1454
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,310
outfit.
Yeah,

1455
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:04,100
go put on some goddamn dress shoes were
in the office.

1456
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:06,830
You know,
it is strange that women were very

1457
01:00:06,831 --> 01:00:09,950
little close in comparison to the way
men do on these shows.

1458
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:12,710
And I don't think there's anything wrong
with the discussion.

1459
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:17,630
The problem is framing it as if he's
saying you shouldn't be able to,

1460
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,421
he's,
if,

1461
01:00:18,421 --> 01:00:22,010
if someone got on TV and said you
shouldn't be able to wear makeup at

1462
01:00:22,011 --> 01:00:23,780
work,
you shouldn't be able to dress like

1463
01:00:23,781 --> 01:00:25,550
that,
that would be a problem.

1464
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,590
So think about what these guys are doing
in effect.

1465
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:27,981
So,
right,

1466
01:00:27,981 --> 01:00:30,770
so you're saying that Jordan's taking
basically a,

1467
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:35,420
a decent but potentially confusing
position,

1468
01:00:35,421 --> 01:00:37,280
but it's,
but it's basically a right decision of

1469
01:00:37,281 --> 01:00:40,190
let's have a conversation.
So when they write all these hippies and

1470
01:00:40,191 --> 01:00:41,930
why do they do it?
Because they can't get any,

1471
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,850
you know,
they just did release this study about

1472
01:00:43,851 --> 01:00:46,820
journalists and they're basically all
paid like 45 grand a year and they're

1473
01:00:46,821 --> 01:00:47,810
alcoholics,
you know,

1474
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:50,660
just broadly speaking.
And they just want all these clicks.

1475
01:00:50,661 --> 01:00:53,840
They want their jobs and they realize
that these websites that are faking as

1476
01:00:53,841 --> 01:00:55,050
journalists,
uh,

1477
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:57,950
faking as places of journalism that
they're just trying to hold onto their

1478
01:00:57,951 --> 01:00:58,970
jobs as long as they can.

1479
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:01,850
But if you're one of these people,
what's a great way to keep your job?

1480
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,340
Oh,
there's a guy out here who sold over a

1481
01:01:04,341 --> 01:01:07,820
million copies of his book who's on tour
selling out beacon theater and blah,

1482
01:01:07,821 --> 01:01:09,140
blah,
blah all over the world.

1483
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:11,270
I'm going to write a hit piece on him
because guess what?

1484
01:01:11,271 --> 01:01:14,120
That's going to drive a hell of a lot
more traffic than writing something,

1485
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:17,150
something honest.
So that's part of the game.

1486
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:18,253
And you know,
he,

1487
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:20,450
I've discussed this many times,
including onstage with him.

1488
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:22,910
Why does he keep retweeting the
articles?

1489
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:26,210
His belief is while I'm still here,
I'm still here.

1490
01:01:26,211 --> 01:01:28,890
I have exposed them and I'm still here
and if anything,

1491
01:01:28,891 --> 01:01:31,280
I'm bigger because of it.
And now one of them was a guy who was

1492
01:01:31,281 --> 01:01:32,370
his friend.
Yeah,

1493
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:36,320
I know he's pissed about that one.
That was a weird one because the guy's

1494
01:01:36,321 --> 01:01:37,430
argument was shit.

1495
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:38,870
It was like I was,
he was like,

1496
01:01:38,871 --> 01:01:40,820
why?
I think Jordan Peterson is dangerous.

1497
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:44,090
Like dangerous.
You didn't explain dude,

1498
01:01:44,091 --> 01:01:46,280
why.
The problem with that is I don't give

1499
01:01:46,281 --> 01:01:49,190
you many chances like that if you write
something like that,

1500
01:01:49,191 --> 01:01:51,470
it doesn't make any sense.
Now I'm going to discredit your

1501
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:52,940
opinions.
I'm not going to think about,

1502
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:54,080
I'm not going to go,
Ooh,

1503
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:56,960
let me listen to this intelligent
person's perspective.

1504
01:01:56,961 --> 01:01:57,651
I'm going to go,
oh,

1505
01:01:57,651 --> 01:02:01,130
this is that silly fuck that dumb idea
about Jordan Peterson.

1506
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:04,640
And I feel like it was just,
it was a some sort of a rationalization

1507
01:02:04,641 --> 01:02:07,130
for him.
Getting attention to virtue,

1508
01:02:07,131 --> 01:02:09,770
signal over what Peterson is saying.
If it didn't,

1509
01:02:09,771 --> 01:02:12,140
he didn't have any real points.
It didn't make any sense.

1510
01:02:12,141 --> 01:02:14,420
I don't think I actually read that,
that full one,

1511
01:02:14,421 --> 01:02:18,380
but I know that I tried to go back over
it and see if I'm,

1512
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:20,190
if it made any sense to me and nothing.

1513
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:22,440
You got nothing that he just didn't
represent.

1514
01:02:22,441 --> 01:02:24,570
His opinions are accurately.
That's the problem.

1515
01:02:24,571 --> 01:02:28,500
When people don't represent the opinions
accurately set up a straw man and then

1516
01:02:28,501 --> 01:02:31,860
attack the straw man and then have this
click baity title.

1517
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:32,371
I'm like,
Oh,

1518
01:02:32,371 --> 01:02:35,460
you just need a hug.
You need attention or is that what it

1519
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:36,600
is?
You're not getting the attention.

1520
01:02:36,601 --> 01:02:37,530
They need a hug.
I mean,

1521
01:02:37,531 --> 01:02:38,260
that's what they need.

1522
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:39,130
I'm telling you,
man,

1523
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:43,120
th this tour,
it has been a freaking love fest.

1524
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:46,540
Every night when I go up there and I'm
warming up the crowd and I'm doing silly

1525
01:02:46,541 --> 01:02:49,180
lobster jokes and you know,
some of his other buzz words,

1526
01:02:49,181 --> 01:02:51,370
and I'll talk about,
make a couple of jokes about Kathy

1527
01:02:51,370 --> 01:02:54,650
Newman or like some other silly things.
So we trying to say is like,

1528
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:58,390
I do like a role on though is like five
different lines of like a whole bunch of

1529
01:02:58,391 --> 01:02:59,920
other stuff.
But like when I,

1530
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:02,500
I'll go up there and I,
I usually make some reference to the

1531
01:03:02,501 --> 01:03:05,410
intellectual dark web.
And if I say your name or I say Shapiro

1532
01:03:05,411 --> 01:03:08,980
or Sam or whatever,
people go crazy.

1533
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:11,590
And what's,
what I'm realizing about it is all of

1534
01:03:11,591 --> 01:03:14,530
these people think about all the people,
however many hundreds of thousands of

1535
01:03:14,531 --> 01:03:16,900
people are watching this or listening to
this right now.

1536
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:19,990
And then how many millions will you know
in the next two weeks or whatever.

1537
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,030
Most of them are doing it alone,
right?

1538
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:25,180
They're watching on their phone or
they're listening on their IPAD,

1539
01:03:25,181 --> 01:03:27,160
whatever it is,
or you're maybe watching with your

1540
01:03:27,161 --> 01:03:28,450
boyfriend or girlfriend.
But most people,

1541
01:03:28,451 --> 01:03:30,070
it's a pretty solitary experience in
the,

1542
01:03:30,071 --> 01:03:34,360
in the world of what we do now imagine.
And it's like when you do stand up now,

1543
01:03:34,361 --> 01:03:38,740
3000 people piled into this place and
you can look around and go,

1544
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:42,180
Whoa,
there's some other people like me and

1545
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,490
they're not bad people.
And actually what I've found is that

1546
01:03:45,491 --> 01:03:47,920
these people look good,
they dress right.

1547
01:03:47,921 --> 01:03:50,410
Like I'm not to make it all about
material stuff,

1548
01:03:50,411 --> 01:03:53,620
but like they look like people who are
trying to get their shit together.

1549
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,930
And I think I said it to you right
before we sat down,

1550
01:03:55,931 --> 01:03:58,810
but me at this moment,
I truly feel like,

1551
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:01,810
like the best that I've ever been,
I really do.

1552
01:04:01,811 --> 01:04:06,370
And it's partly because of that because
you cannot be around that constantly.

1553
01:04:06,371 --> 01:04:08,770
I'm not saying everything he says is
right and I'm still not with them on

1554
01:04:08,771 --> 01:04:10,660
some of the religious stuff.
And I have Sam,

1555
01:04:10,661 --> 01:04:14,140
I'm doing my show when I leave here to
go with Sam Harris and there they,

1556
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:16,300
you know,
they are really at logger heads on some

1557
01:04:16,301 --> 01:04:16,450
of the,

1558
01:04:16,450 --> 01:04:18,430
the training need.
I'm a moderator,

1559
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:20,320
I swear to God.
And Sam has said this too.

1560
01:04:20,321 --> 01:04:22,540
I swear to God,
if I was there with the two of them,

1561
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:26,920
I could worked it out when that whole
truth thing that they bounded back and

1562
01:04:26,921 --> 01:04:29,200
forth for an hour on the meaning of
truth.

1563
01:04:29,590 --> 01:04:32,950
I wish I was there and we talked about
doing some live event together.

1564
01:04:32,951 --> 01:04:35,740
We never got around it because Sam's
doing a lot of live events as well.

1565
01:04:35,741 --> 01:04:38,080
So they're doing it with their having
Bret Weinstein,

1566
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:39,310
uh,
moderate it.

1567
01:04:39,311 --> 01:04:40,470
But I would have been thrilled if it
was,

1568
01:04:40,490 --> 01:04:41,900
look,
I love bread and there's nothing about

1569
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:46,450
prep or would be nice like so either it
could have been one of us or or

1570
01:04:46,451 --> 01:04:48,280
whatever.
It's completely fine.

1571
01:04:48,281 --> 01:04:51,910
And I think they just wanted like a more
sciency focused person and he's a great

1572
01:04:51,911 --> 01:04:54,910
biologist powerhouses.
Like if there's any,

1573
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:56,710
like they're doing Jujitsu on each
other.

1574
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:59,380
This is any like openings and trying to
choke each other.

1575
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:02,440
It's kind of,
but that's how we find out if ideas are

1576
01:05:02,441 --> 01:05:03,251
valid,
you know,

1577
01:05:03,251 --> 01:05:05,590
you'll,
you'll let guys like them discuss them.

1578
01:05:05,591 --> 01:05:07,810
They just,
it was very unfortunate that at least

1579
01:05:07,811 --> 01:05:08,760
their first part.
First one.

1580
01:05:08,761 --> 01:05:10,600
Yeah.
The second one I think was much better,

1581
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:12,670
but the first one was just a cluster
fest.

1582
01:05:12,671 --> 01:05:14,320
I called Sam up afterwards.
I was like,

1583
01:05:14,321 --> 01:05:16,990
this is crazy.
This is a non conversation you guys.

1584
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:17,661
He's like,
yeah,

1585
01:05:17,661 --> 01:05:17,980
I just

1586
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,920
got stuck.
Yeah,

1587
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,330
but think how cool that is that two of
them are.

1588
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:26,230
The two of them are some of our leading
public intellectuals in the country,

1589
01:05:26,231 --> 01:05:27,500
in the world,
probably [inaudible].

1590
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:33,460
They're debating over the nature of
truth and millions of people care.

1591
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:37,480
That's a little different than what's
going on on CNN on any given day.

1592
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:38,290
Oh,
for sure.

1593
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:40,570
Well,
there's a real problem with mainstream

1594
01:05:40,571 --> 01:05:43,660
news and first of all,
there's a problem in that it's a ratings

1595
01:05:43,661 --> 01:05:45,790
driven thing.
It's like everything they're doing,

1596
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:48,460
they're trying to get ratings.
Anytime there's a big story in the news,

1597
01:05:48,461 --> 01:05:49,211
it's just like,
what is it?

1598
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:50,390
What are people going to pay attention
to?

1599
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,780
That's what we're going to put on.
There's no consideration.

1600
01:05:52,781 --> 01:05:54,070
Like,
is this interesting to us?

1601
01:05:54,071 --> 01:05:55,890
Is this what we want to discuss?
It's,

1602
01:05:55,891 --> 01:05:58,210
it's a news program,
but it's not a news program because it's

1603
01:05:58,211 --> 01:06:01,180
also in an entertainment program and
then they have commercials every 15

1604
01:06:01,181 --> 01:06:02,014
minutes.

1605
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:04,810
Did you say that Jim Acosta thing?
What he did during the,

1606
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:08,350
during the Korea thing like that is
crazy.

1607
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:13,090
That's crazy that a journalist would
insert himself into that sort of a

1608
01:06:13,091 --> 01:06:17,140
situation and interrupt and yell things
out and people don't have a problem with

1609
01:06:17,141 --> 01:06:18,340
that.
We are,

1610
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:23,490
we are truly watching the implosion of
the media and that's why I meant before,

1611
01:06:23,861 --> 01:06:25,690
it's like if they would just lie a
little bit,

1612
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:29,200
well just lie a little bit on the
margins as they probably always have

1613
01:06:29,201 --> 01:06:31,390
done.
I don't think we'd be in this position

1614
01:06:31,391 --> 01:06:34,360
because people wouldn't be able to so
clearly see how messed up the whole

1615
01:06:34,361 --> 01:06:37,750
thing is.
But because they've become so hysterical

1616
01:06:37,751 --> 01:06:40,450
writing articles that are completely the
reverse of the truth,

1617
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:44,560
because they're actually acting like
petulant children all the time and

1618
01:06:44,561 --> 01:06:47,230
because they,
half the time it's like they pretend

1619
01:06:47,231 --> 01:06:49,300
they're nonpartisan,
but if you just look at any of these

1620
01:06:49,301 --> 01:06:50,200
journalists,
twitter feeds,

1621
01:06:50,201 --> 01:06:52,240
it's like pretty obvious what you all
are.

1622
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:57,130
All of you in the mainstream media,
they've created an opening so that now

1623
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:01,780
if people want some sense of truth,
you turn into Joe Rogan and you're

1624
01:07:01,781 --> 01:07:05,920
turning to all of these other shows.
I think it's very difficult to get

1625
01:07:05,921 --> 01:07:10,630
employment if you're not on one side of
the fence or the other side of the fence

1626
01:07:10,631 --> 01:07:12,010
and you're a journalist.
It's not,

1627
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:14,530
it's,
it's not a simple world like the world

1628
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:16,810
of podcasting where you truly can be
independent.

1629
01:07:16,811 --> 01:07:17,750
Yeah,
and I mean I think,

1630
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:19,900
I think in a lot of ways it's like
Hollywood.

1631
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:22,900
I mean I've always described Hollywood
is one of the main problems with it.

1632
01:07:22,901 --> 01:07:25,300
As you get a bunch of people that come
here seeking attention,

1633
01:07:25,301 --> 01:07:26,410
right?
That's the reason why they are here in

1634
01:07:26,411 --> 01:07:27,730
the first place.
They want fame,

1635
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:30,130
they want exorbitant amounts of
attention.

1636
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:32,920
And then on top of that,
you are entered into this system where

1637
01:07:32,921 --> 01:07:35,320
you have to be chosen for each part.

1638
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:38,590
It's not like you can,
like you have a sprint and the the guy

1639
01:07:38,591 --> 01:07:40,600
who's the fastest is the one who wins.
Yeah,

1640
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:42,970
it does not like that.
It's someone's who smelled.

1641
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,530
Dave,
why don't you read these lines like,

1642
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,420
hmm,
I might like you dave.

1643
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,090
How do you feel about Hillary Clinton?
Because I'm pro Clinton.

1644
01:07:49,091 --> 01:07:50,320
I mean,
we want Clinton to win.

1645
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:52,240
Don't we want Clinton to win Dave?
And you're like,

1646
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:53,021
oh my God.
Yeah,

1647
01:07:53,021 --> 01:07:54,980
you'll drop your standards are like,
I'm,

1648
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:57,880
I'm a huge supporter of Clinton.
I think she's amazing.

1649
01:07:58,060 --> 01:08:00,210
And I've seen this because you're,
you're,

1650
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:05,050
it's this weird environment where you
want these people to like you.

1651
01:08:05,051 --> 01:08:10,051
So you are terrified of saying anything
even remotely controversial that doesn't

1652
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:13,340
stick to the script of this left wing
discourse.

1653
01:08:13,341 --> 01:08:14,590
So there's all these people that are
just,

1654
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:16,550
just,
just faking it.

1655
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:18,230
They're bullshitting you if they didn't
mind,

1656
01:08:18,231 --> 01:08:21,800
not even have real opinions,
but they've adopted this predetermined

1657
01:08:21,801 --> 01:08:25,220
pattern of opinions that they think that
is going to help them get through the

1658
01:08:25,221 --> 01:08:28,280
door with these producers and these
studio executives.

1659
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:31,770
And that's Hollywood.
And then when someone breaks free and

1660
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:32,240
you know,
the,

1661
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:34,550
occasionally someone becomes right wing,
you know,

1662
01:08:34,551 --> 01:08:38,240
whoever the fuck they are with,
it's chuck woolery or Dennis Miller,

1663
01:08:38,241 --> 01:08:40,820
or they'll like,
look at that fucking crazy man probe

1664
01:08:40,821 --> 01:08:42,060
from the pack.
You know,

1665
01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:43,550
look at what's,
what's his name,

1666
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:45,920
the fucking actor guy.
The older guy,

1667
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:48,770
Jon Voight,
not Jon voight,

1668
01:08:48,771 --> 01:08:50,940
the other one.
A very good actor.

1669
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:55,160
Gary sinise got a bigger deck,
supposedly got in trouble with Dave

1670
01:08:55,161 --> 01:09:00,020
crosses a wife.
He said like Dave Cross's wife said that

1671
01:09:00,021 --> 01:09:02,510
he tried to hit on her when she was 16.
James Woods.

1672
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:03,730
James Woods.
Yeah.

1673
01:09:03,970 --> 01:09:04,690
Yeah.
He's,

1674
01:09:04,690 --> 01:09:06,770
he's really dealt himself.
He's got a giant deck.

1675
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:07,870
Yeah,
that's what I hear.

1676
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:10,130
Uh,
yeah,

1677
01:09:10,131 --> 01:09:11,780
he's dealt himself in.
He's all in.

1678
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:15,050
He's all in and he's like sort of like
resigned himself to never work again.

1679
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:16,250
Yeah.
I mean it means,

1680
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,350
but he's probably like 75 years old or
whatever he is.

1681
01:09:18,351 --> 01:09:19,640
He's probably,
I don't give a fuck anymore.

1682
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:21,440
Yeah.
I mean I'm pretty sure he's got fuck you

1683
01:09:21,441 --> 01:09:22,780
money like probably,
yeah,

1684
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,820
it's definitely saying fuck you.
So if he doesn't have the money that he

1685
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:28,340
might want to send their data.
Yeah,

1686
01:09:28,341 --> 01:09:30,980
exactly.
But doesn't that prove though why doing

1687
01:09:30,981 --> 01:09:35,090
this was the right thing to do?
Because I'm very aware right now.

1688
01:09:35,091 --> 01:09:37,010
It's like I got a lot of good shit going
on.

1689
01:09:37,011 --> 01:09:39,590
I'm getting offers and all sorts of
different things and I'm like,

1690
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:40,970
I,
I,

1691
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,100
I'm my own boss.
I'm not going to fire me.

1692
01:09:43,101 --> 01:09:45,410
I'm not going to accidentally tweet
something one day and then go with that.

1693
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:46,550
I'm going to fire day Ruben.
Like,

1694
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:47,830
you know,
like my,

1695
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:51,440
my fans fund most of what we do and it's
like I need to grow.

1696
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,240
Like we definitely need to grow because
there's,

1697
01:09:53,241 --> 01:09:54,980
we're just,
my guys are just doing too much.

1698
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:58,070
But I'm also very aware that the more we
start growing that,

1699
01:09:58,071 --> 01:10:01,910
all the problems that you just laid out,
we'll start becoming more and more real.

1700
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:04,550
So I like being as slim and trim as
possible,

1701
01:10:04,551 --> 01:10:09,230
at least for now because I don't want to
be down the road where we've had,

1702
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:11,990
we got too many people.
There's too many just different

1703
01:10:11,991 --> 01:10:15,320
competing interests and business
interests and political interests and

1704
01:10:15,321 --> 01:10:16,880
everything else.
So it's like,

1705
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:18,950
that's why,
I mean you're what you're doing here,

1706
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:20,480
it's freaking,
it's amazing man.

1707
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:21,550
It's amazing.

1708
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:24,460
Yeah,
it's nice to be able to do it for sure.

1709
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:28,510
It's nice to be able to just have
opinions on things and,

1710
01:10:28,530 --> 01:10:32,720
and,
and also just know that you're a nice

1711
01:10:32,721 --> 01:10:35,420
person and that you're not trying to,
like,

1712
01:10:35,421 --> 01:10:37,900
I'm not trying to do any evil.
Like I'm in a,

1713
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:38,571
I'm,
I like,

1714
01:10:38,571 --> 01:10:40,730
I look at like who I am.
Like I'm a nice guy.

1715
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:41,903
Like,
okay,

1716
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:43,050
all right,
well what are my opinions of,

1717
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:44,990
why can't I talk to this guy?
Why can I have,

1718
01:10:45,050 --> 01:10:46,940
what can I have discussions in these
subjects?

1719
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:48,920
You know,
like there's a lot of people that feel

1720
01:10:48,921 --> 01:10:52,400
like if you're not in a certain group,
you shouldn't have discussions on

1721
01:10:52,401 --> 01:10:54,170
certain things.
If you're a straight man,

1722
01:10:54,171 --> 01:10:56,450
you shouldn't talk about gay rights.
If you're a man,

1723
01:10:56,451 --> 01:10:59,390
you shouldn't talk about women's issues.
You shouldn't talk about me too.

1724
01:10:59,391 --> 01:11:03,080
Unless you're 100% supportive.
You shouldn't discuss the subtle nuance

1725
01:11:03,081 --> 01:11:04,430
of human interaction.
Well,

1726
01:11:04,431 --> 01:11:05,360
it didn't.
Martin Luther King,

1727
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:07,010
he wanted us to be judged by those
things.

1728
01:11:07,011 --> 01:11:07,671
Right.
And he said,

1729
01:11:07,671 --> 01:11:09,610
if you're only this color,
you can talk about that.

1730
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:12,610
I'm pretty sure that's what he said.
Yeah,

1731
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:15,120
that's where we're at.
But also,

1732
01:11:15,121 --> 01:11:16,530
you know,
there was an article right after that

1733
01:11:16,531 --> 01:11:19,920
idw thing came out in the times that was
calling you a conservative.

1734
01:11:19,921 --> 01:11:20,431
And I think,
I,

1735
01:11:20,431 --> 01:11:23,150
I think I emailed it to you,
man.

1736
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:26,790
It was the twitter thing.
The renegade conservative,

1737
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:29,070
that's what it was.
Pro Gay rights.

1738
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:32,640
Pro Women's rights.
Pro choice pro marijuana,

1739
01:11:32,910 --> 01:11:36,540
pro universal health care pro universal
basic income.

1740
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:39,360
Like what else do I have to do?
Like what other things am I,

1741
01:11:39,690 --> 01:11:40,980
oh,
pro second amendment.

1742
01:11:40,981 --> 01:11:41,900
He must be right one.
Yeah.

1743
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:42,421
Well,
Joe,

1744
01:11:42,421 --> 01:11:44,250
you're off.
You can't just have you,

1745
01:11:44,251 --> 01:11:47,040
what do you think?
You can have a series of thoughts that

1746
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:50,760
don't all lock in with what you have to
be in a pattern that you have to be in

1747
01:11:50,761 --> 01:11:53,190
the pattern.
I'm not just don't understand why

1748
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:56,070
someone's willing to be dishonest like
that.

1749
01:11:56,220 --> 01:12:01,220
Like a cursory examination of people's
thoughts and positions on things would

1750
01:12:01,711 --> 01:12:04,410
lead someone to realize I'm definitely
not a right wing person,

1751
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:07,170
but,
but the thing is that they own the

1752
01:12:07,171 --> 01:12:10,070
narrative for so long and that they can
still get away with it.

1753
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:10,800
Yes,
yes.

1754
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,580
And what's happening is now it's
shifting and that's what I mean by I

1755
01:12:14,581 --> 01:12:17,400
think we're starting to win.
And I don't mean it when like we're

1756
01:12:17,401 --> 01:12:19,530
going to destroy these people.
I mean,

1757
01:12:19,531 --> 01:12:24,150
I think the narrative has started to
shift a little bit where the enthusiasm

1758
01:12:24,151 --> 01:12:26,340
behind the conversations that we're all
having,

1759
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:30,660
whoever it is in this thing,
the enthusiasm is so great and there is

1760
01:12:30,661 --> 01:12:34,440
no counter enthusiasts.
Like where are all the versions of us on

1761
01:12:34,441 --> 01:12:36,750
the other side of this?
I'm a bright,

1762
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,460
no,
I don't even mean on the right,

1763
01:12:38,461 --> 01:12:42,570
like the people that really are selling
identity politics had a really great way

1764
01:12:42,571 --> 01:12:46,410
at a comedy level who have a huge
podcast and like where is the,

1765
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:48,030
where is that intellectual set of
people?

1766
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:51,030
Where's the Sam Harris of the other side
of this or the that have real

1767
01:12:51,031 --> 01:12:53,730
followings.
They don't exist and that's partly why

1768
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,620
the hysteria has been ramped up.

1769
01:12:55,650 --> 01:12:59,390
They can't believe that out of nowhere,
just because of our,

1770
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:04,320
all of our just wherewithal and desire
to do what we think is right or what

1771
01:13:04,321 --> 01:13:06,210
makes us happy or whatever the hell you
want to call it.

1772
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,880
They can't believe we all freaking
created something.

1773
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:10,950
Well,
the queer shout that we're all in a

1774
01:13:10,951 --> 01:13:13,030
group,
I'm weirded out that we're in a super

1775
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:17,220
boy band.
We're in a boy band or I guess Christina

1776
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:18,053
Hoff Summers.
Isn't that band too?

1777
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,020
Who else is in that band?
Is Heather in it?

1778
01:13:20,090 --> 01:13:21,780
Yeah,
it has it in hang a sheet in there.

1779
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:23,300
I mean it looks,
we don't have to Brett,

1780
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:25,110
but you didn't get the car yet and then
get the card.

1781
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,420
The clubhouse is under your studio.
Man.

1782
01:13:27,421 --> 01:13:30,270
Shapiro with joking around about it,
but like we're like the super friends,

1783
01:13:30,570 --> 01:13:32,850
like what is this?
This is the weirdest avengers ever.

1784
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:35,340
It's a weird group of humans.
I mean me and Ben,

1785
01:13:35,341 --> 01:13:38,280
we disagree on a lot of shit,
but we're super friendly to each other.

1786
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:42,130
Like when I do his show or he does my,
I really enjoy that guy like him.

1787
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:44,810
You do freaking Shapiro show before my
show what?

1788
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:45,600
Sorry.
What?

1789
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:49,620
The guys had a shelf for three weeks.
People were mad at me with the way I

1790
01:13:49,621 --> 01:13:50,850
dressed.
See that.

1791
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:54,310
They're like,
everybody else is wearing a nice shirt

1792
01:13:54,311 --> 01:13:54,811
at a time.
Like,

1793
01:13:54,811 --> 01:13:57,000
listen man,
I told the guy I was on my way to the

1794
01:13:57,001 --> 01:13:58,590
comedy store.
You want to take a photo of me?

1795
01:13:58,591 --> 01:14:00,450
I'll be there.
You're not in the bush.

1796
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:01,500
In the brush.
Yeah.

1797
01:14:01,501 --> 01:14:04,350
I should be in a bush.
I everybody down sucking it up my ass.

1798
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:09,560
I'm wearing a fucking chucks or converse
and a some sort of a flannel shirt that

1799
01:14:11,950 --> 01:14:13,480
I bought that jacket Alaska.

1800
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:16,750
I've just,
that's how it was where I just,

1801
01:14:16,751 --> 01:14:19,990
what I was wearing at the comedy store.
I said,

1802
01:14:19,991 --> 01:14:21,790
all right man,
that's what I'm wearing.

1803
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:24,420
No greenery around.
The comedy store could go up to sunset,

1804
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:28,360
but either way I just don't,
I don't give a fuck.

1805
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:29,950
That's what I looked like.
That's who I am.

1806
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:33,490
I'm not interested in portraying an
image.

1807
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:36,040
Just it is what it is.
You know?

1808
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:39,490
It's like this,
this intellectual dark web like it's

1809
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:42,190
fucking Eric.
He's crazy and he's,

1810
01:14:42,210 --> 01:14:44,470
he gets mad when I call him crazy.
He loves it.

1811
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:46,780
He's trying to get me to,
are you on the whatsapp?

1812
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:47,643
Oh,
I'm on the one hand.

1813
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,480
The little fucking check group.
No,

1814
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:53,170
I haven't jumped in yet.
I've been busy.

1815
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:57,640
I don't have the time.
Just two or three messages a day for

1816
01:14:57,641 --> 01:15:01,930
different group text conversations with
comedians were talking shit about things

1817
01:15:01,931 --> 01:15:02,590
and talking around.

1818
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:04,750
I don't have time for this.
I'm busy,

1819
01:15:04,751 --> 01:15:05,680
man.
All right,

1820
01:15:05,681 --> 01:15:07,930
well then you can't come to the club
trying to make a yoga class.

1821
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:09,700
I don't know.
Fucking time.

1822
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:12,280
Yeah.
Who the hell goes like are we a group

1823
01:15:12,281 --> 01:15:14,560
that we do,
we have a meeting and shall act cards

1824
01:15:14,561 --> 01:15:18,430
and like we have in common.
I think we have a respect for our

1825
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:21,940
audience and intellectual curiosity.
Curiosity for sure.

1826
01:15:21,970 --> 01:15:22,750
Yeah.
Yeah.

1827
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:27,370
And I think that's where,
that's where a guy like me and Shapiro,

1828
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:30,820
although we have very different opinions
on many different things,

1829
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:34,540
you know,
I think we both are intellectually

1830
01:15:34,541 --> 01:15:35,410
curious.
Yeah.

1831
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:37,600
So think about it.
I've had been on many times,

1832
01:15:37,601 --> 01:15:38,780
I consider him a friend.
We've,

1833
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,140
we've broke bread together,
although he's kosher,

1834
01:15:41,141 --> 01:15:43,270
which makes it fucking pain.
What do you have to eat?

1835
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:45,990
Has such a smart guy.
Follow that blue,

1836
01:15:45,991 --> 01:15:46,570
do well.

1837
01:15:46,570 --> 01:15:48,790
I eat whatever the hell it to him about
whatever I want.

1838
01:15:48,791 --> 01:15:50,990
But he usually brings something or you
know,

1839
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:52,780
has to watch.
You did a kosher restaurant.

1840
01:15:53,290 --> 01:15:54,910
I did eat at a kosher restaurant with
him once,

1841
01:15:54,911 --> 01:15:57,550
but then it was all these orthodox Jews
there and then they treat him like

1842
01:15:57,551 --> 01:15:58,301
Jesus.
And I was like,

1843
01:15:58,301 --> 01:15:59,770
dude,
I'm not a photographer.

1844
01:15:59,771 --> 01:16:01,360
You know what I mean?
I have to take all these pictures of

1845
01:16:01,361 --> 01:16:01,841
him.
And they're like,

1846
01:16:01,841 --> 01:16:02,690
who's that guy?
I was like,

1847
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,660
I'm not doing that again,
but it's funny,

1848
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:06,190
but you know,
I've had Shapiro and look,

1849
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,460
he's not inherently for gay marriage,
right?

1850
01:16:09,461 --> 01:16:12,430
I've had my studio is in my house where
I knew what his thoughts on gay

1851
01:16:12,431 --> 01:16:12,850
marriage.
Well,

1852
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:14,610
now he takes the Libertarian position
at,

1853
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:16,180
which is the government shouldn't be
involved,

1854
01:16:16,181 --> 01:16:18,610
but I don't know.
But I see a lot of conservatives doing

1855
01:16:18,611 --> 01:16:20,530
that where they should have all,
like,

1856
01:16:20,531 --> 01:16:22,420
this is where Rand Paul Lynn mentioned
before,

1857
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:25,660
he should have been years ago screaming
that he's for gay marriage because if

1858
01:16:25,661 --> 01:16:28,610
you're truly a libertarian,
the government doesn't delaminate the

1859
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:31,360
smoke was sleep with the libertarians.

1860
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:34,780
She could have taken a really awesome,
powerful,

1861
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,960
principled position and said,
this isn't about religion.

1862
01:16:37,961 --> 01:16:39,250
It's not about,
it's about freedom.

1863
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,980
It's one of the things that a shove in
the face of people that were Hillary

1864
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:43,930
Clinton supporters and my,
do you know that she didn't support gay

1865
01:16:43,931 --> 01:16:46,100
marriage?
She'll 2013 you know,

1866
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:47,260
goddamn crazy.
It is.

1867
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:52,500
I supported it when I was 13 this
fucking grown up old lady with

1868
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:53,960
grandchildren.
Yeah.

1869
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:57,490
Is Talent people that she's not for gay
marriage until it became convenient

1870
01:16:57,491 --> 01:17:01,740
politically and she just wanted to
separate herself as being at least the

1871
01:17:01,741 --> 01:17:05,270
semi conservative option compared to
Barack Obama.

1872
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:07,600
Look,
Barack Obama was not for gay marriage at

1873
01:17:07,601 --> 01:17:08,920
the beginning.
He got pinned into it.

1874
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:10,190
Biden made that stupid

1875
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:12,170
comment on meet the press where he was
basically like,

1876
01:17:12,171 --> 01:17:13,970
everyone's forward and then Obama had to
come out for it.

1877
01:17:13,971 --> 01:17:15,170
But think about it.
If,

1878
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:18,170
if all of this stuff that we're talking
about keeps winning,

1879
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:21,770
if it all keeps winning,
what will happen in 50 years,

1880
01:17:21,771 --> 01:17:25,460
they will literally look back at video
of Barack Obama campaigning the first

1881
01:17:25,461 --> 01:17:28,730
time around saying that he's for
traditional marriage and they will call

1882
01:17:28,731 --> 01:17:31,700
Barack Obama a homophobe and they will
eventually want them.

1883
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:35,600
They will want the Barack Obama library
that's being built now in Chicago.

1884
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:38,150
They will want that being taken down
because that will be the,

1885
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:41,690
that will be the statues of our day.
So that that's why I don't know where

1886
01:17:41,691 --> 01:17:44,480
you're at on the monument stuff,
but I would not take any of them down.

1887
01:17:44,481 --> 01:17:48,110
You can put up a counselor plaque or
something right next to it to say Robert

1888
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:48,943
E.
Lee did this or that,

1889
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:52,610
but the idea that they're removing the
shit I think is absolutely terrible.

1890
01:17:52,611 --> 01:17:53,720
You can't erase history.

1891
01:17:53,830 --> 01:17:54,641
No,
I agree with you.

1892
01:17:54,641 --> 01:17:56,770
I think they should.
This is a problem with having them in

1893
01:17:56,771 --> 01:17:59,980
town squares and celebrating them,
but there's also a problem that they

1894
01:17:59,981 --> 01:18:01,510
were all,
most of them,

1895
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:04,120
the ones that you're there,
they're talking about in the south.

1896
01:18:04,121 --> 01:18:07,000
They were resurrected during the civil
rights movement to sort of counteract

1897
01:18:07,001 --> 01:18:09,040
the civil rights movement.
So like these,

1898
01:18:09,070 --> 01:18:13,120
these are really,
this is not like a celebration of these

1899
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:16,300
people back in the day when they were a
viable,

1900
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:18,310
this is during the civil rights
movement.

1901
01:18:18,311 --> 01:18:23,311
They erected these fairly cheap and they
put them up quickly and they did it in

1902
01:18:23,321 --> 01:18:27,760
response to black people wanting more
rights and you know,

1903
01:18:27,790 --> 01:18:29,310
they would still,
I would still face,

1904
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:29,940
yeah,

1905
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:32,490
I get it.
I would still be not for taking them

1906
01:18:32,491 --> 01:18:33,900
down.
You put up something next to it,

1907
01:18:33,901 --> 01:18:36,180
you put it,
you see what I would you want to come?

1908
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:39,630
I'm for taking it down and replacing
them with something else and putting

1909
01:18:39,631 --> 01:18:41,640
them somewhere else.
Like if you want to have a civil war

1910
01:18:41,641 --> 01:18:43,800
museum.
So that would be the compromise where

1911
01:18:43,810 --> 01:18:45,870
you could get me,
I'm not saying you should melt them,

1912
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,480
but it's,
there's something too,

1913
01:18:49,170 --> 01:18:53,400
there's something to the argument that
they're racist statues and especially if

1914
01:18:53,401 --> 01:18:56,100
you understand the motivation behind
creating them in the first place.

1915
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:57,540
Yeah.
The problem though is that,

1916
01:18:58,160 --> 01:18:58,911
you know,
I mean,

1917
01:18:58,911 --> 01:19:01,320
I know you know this,
it never ends where it's supposed to

1918
01:19:01,321 --> 01:19:01,860
end,

1919
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:04,410
wanted to go after George Washington and
trump said they did.

1920
01:19:04,530 --> 01:19:07,410
Trump said that and people were riddick
ridiculing him.

1921
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:10,890
And then almost immediately afterwards,
someone wanted to take down a statue of

1922
01:19:10,891 --> 01:19:11,610
George Wallace.

1923
01:19:11,610 --> 01:19:15,600
I was in old town Alexandria where
George Washington's Church was,

1924
01:19:15,601 --> 01:19:17,340
and it's actually the same church that
Robert E.

1925
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:19,080
Lee went to.
So they had a plaque for both of them.

1926
01:19:19,081 --> 01:19:21,630
And because they took down the Robert E.
Lee One,

1927
01:19:21,631 --> 01:19:25,290
they also took down the George
Washington one at the church that George

1928
01:19:25,290 --> 01:19:26,160
Washington went to.
I mean,

1929
01:19:26,161 --> 01:19:29,340
if you follow that logic,
and this is what you have to do when

1930
01:19:29,341 --> 01:19:30,570
you're,
when you're doing these sort of

1931
01:19:30,571 --> 01:19:34,170
historical trackings,
they will come for everything.

1932
01:19:34,171 --> 01:19:36,780
So think about it.
Thomas Jefferson's my favorite founder,

1933
01:19:36,930 --> 01:19:39,180
Thomas Jefferson.
You can go to his house in Monte Cello

1934
01:19:39,390 --> 01:19:40,890
and they do,
if you go on the tour,

1935
01:19:40,891 --> 01:19:43,500
it's incredible.
They are incredibly honest about his

1936
01:19:43,501 --> 01:19:46,170
relationship to slavery,
that he owned slaves his whole life.

1937
01:19:46,171 --> 01:19:49,650
He was having an affair with at least
one slave and most likely had children

1938
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:53,100
with that slave.
At the same time he was writing the laws

1939
01:19:53,101 --> 01:19:55,590
that freed the slaves.
So without this man,

1940
01:19:55,950 --> 01:19:59,030
these things don't move forward.
So we all live with these odd in

1941
01:19:59,031 --> 01:20:00,540
consistencies.
George Washington,

1942
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:03,780
George Washington,
who gave up power after the,

1943
01:20:03,810 --> 01:20:06,690
after the revolution,
like he did the most incredible thing.

1944
01:20:06,691 --> 01:20:08,220
You know,
he a power as the commander

1945
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:12,210
of the army after the revolution,
the most incredible thing that a leader

1946
01:20:12,211 --> 01:20:15,870
of a country could do.
He owned slaves his entire life when he

1947
01:20:15,871 --> 01:20:18,000
died and this,
they do this at his house in,

1948
01:20:18,001 --> 01:20:19,190
um,
it's out.

1949
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:21,070
It's outside DC.
I'm blanking on it for a second.

1950
01:20:21,071 --> 01:20:23,280
I'll get in a second.
But you can go on the tour there.

1951
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:26,550
And he had his slaves his entire life.
When he died,

1952
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:29,700
his half of the slaves got freed.
But Martha Washington's half didn't,

1953
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:32,990
Martha kept a slot that kept this bitch.
Yeah.

1954
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:38,220
So it's like all of these things,
it's like so surely had half the slaves

1955
01:20:38,221 --> 01:20:42,000
were kind of inherited them I think from
her parents or something like that.

1956
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:44,730
Like it's all,
it's deeply twisted and warped.

1957
01:20:44,731 --> 01:20:49,410
And of course it was.
Now of course we can objectively look at

1958
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:51,840
it and go,
slavery was wrong and you shouldn't of

1959
01:20:51,841 --> 01:20:52,674
course.

1960
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:56,040
But they all were doing things in their
time that you'd,

1961
01:20:56,041 --> 01:20:59,430
the world doesn't magically become what
you want it to be just because you exist

1962
01:20:59,431 --> 01:21:02,160
and think something.
And the more that we start thinking

1963
01:21:02,161 --> 01:21:03,810
that,
the more we'll eventually come after

1964
01:21:03,811 --> 01:21:06,510
Obama for running against gay marriage
the first time and,

1965
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:09,250
and all of these things.
There is something that we think you

1966
01:21:09,251 --> 01:21:10,081
love meat,
right?

1967
01:21:10,081 --> 01:21:11,850
You love elk and all this other stuff.
Guess what?

1968
01:21:11,851 --> 01:21:14,730
One day,
if this craziness keeps going,

1969
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:18,110
they will look back when you're
grandfather and there'll be like date

1970
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:20,370
meet because we're at that point we'll
be eating,

1971
01:21:20,371 --> 01:21:22,290
you know,
artificially produced whatever.

1972
01:21:22,291 --> 01:21:24,600
And they'll,
they'll literally watch videos of you

1973
01:21:24,601 --> 01:21:25,650
chomping on,
you know,

1974
01:21:25,651 --> 01:21:28,500
some ribs and go see what a savage he
was.

1975
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:32,160
So that's why you have to just be aware
of what your time is.

1976
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:33,600
Your time in this world.

1977
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:34,650
Yeah.
They're doing it right now.

1978
01:21:34,651 --> 01:21:35,610
Exactly.
Yeah.

1979
01:21:35,611 --> 01:21:37,620
Um,
did you ever see the video of Obama

1980
01:21:37,621 --> 01:21:40,200
talking about illegal immigration?
It's incredible.

1981
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,960
It's really amazing.
It's when he was a senator and running

1982
01:21:42,961 --> 01:21:47,130
for president the first time.
And he is more like,

1983
01:21:47,131 --> 01:21:49,230
he's stricter than,
than trump.

1984
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:52,650
Yes.
I mean it's a fascinating thing because

1985
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,450
no one brings that up and no one called
him braced.

1986
01:21:55,940 --> 01:21:59,400
But I guess we're dealing with a long
time ago,

1987
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:00,810
you know,
I mean,

1988
01:22:00,811 --> 01:22:01,940
there's a couple of things.
He was,

1989
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:04,590
it was a 2011 it was doing that.
He was a senator,

1990
01:22:04,591 --> 01:22:07,080
so it was probably around 2010,
2011,

1991
01:22:07,081 --> 01:22:07,891
something like that.
I mean,

1992
01:22:07,891 --> 01:22:09,000
look,
there's a lot of things there,

1993
01:22:09,001 --> 01:22:09,411
right?
He,

1994
01:22:09,411 --> 01:22:10,590
I mean,
he's black number one.

1995
01:22:10,591 --> 01:22:12,930
So it's like they're not going to call
him racist.

1996
01:22:12,931 --> 01:22:15,000
It doesn't,
it creates a thing where they can't

1997
01:22:15,001 --> 01:22:16,830
compute.
What does that actually mean?

1998
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:19,770
He was saying the things that people
wanted to hear.

1999
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:22,770
He also wanted it to be elected.
He wanted to be elected.

2000
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:26,450
So they elevated him to a point that he
was God play that he was pulseless

2001
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:29,200
listened to this 2005,
2005.

2002
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:30,360
Yeah,
it says early.

2003
01:22:30,361 --> 01:22:34,530
Oh,
so he's on the need to better secure the

2004
01:22:34,531 --> 01:22:38,970
border and a punish employers who chose
to hire illegal immigrants.

2005
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:39,870
Uh,
you know,

2006
01:22:39,870 --> 01:22:42,810
we are a generous and welcoming people
here in the United States,

2007
01:22:42,811 --> 01:22:46,350
but those who enter the country
illegally and those who employ them

2008
01:22:46,470 --> 01:22:48,800
disrespect the rule of law.
Uh,

2009
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:54,110
and they are showing disregard for those
who are following the law.

2010
01:22:54,990 --> 01:22:59,990
We simply cannot allow people to pour
into the United States undetected,

2011
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:05,110
undocumented,
unchecked and circumventing the line of

2012
01:23:05,111 --> 01:23:06,070
people who are waiting

2013
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:07,570
patiently,
diligently,

2014
01:23:07,571 --> 01:23:08,710
and lawfully,
uh,

2015
01:23:09,010 --> 01:23:14,010
to become immigrants in this country.
So that's why we need to start by giving

2016
01:23:14,111 --> 01:23:16,900
agencies charged with border security,
new technology,

2017
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:21,190
new facilities,
and more people to stop the process and

2018
01:23:21,191 --> 01:23:25,120
deport illegal immigrants.
Having said that,

2019
01:23:25,690 --> 01:23:30,220
securing the borders alone does not
solve immigration management.

2020
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:35,020
We're going to have to better manage
legal immigration in order to end

2021
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:37,420
illegal immigration.
Uh,

2022
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:39,850
senators,
mccain and Kennedy point us in the right

2023
01:23:39,851 --> 01:23:44,470
direction on that point right now we've
got millions of illegal immigrants who

2024
01:23:44,471 --> 01:23:48,820
live and work here without knowing their
identity or background.

2025
01:23:49,450 --> 01:23:53,410
That's part of the reason that we need a
guest worker program to replace the

2026
01:23:53,411 --> 01:23:58,240
flood of illegals with a regulated
stream of legals who enter the United

2027
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:01,810
States after checks and with access to
labor rights.

2028
01:24:01,811 --> 01:24:06,811
Part of the reason that illegal
immigration is so damaging is that it

2029
01:24:06,911 --> 01:24:11,860
ends up creating a pool of workers with
depressed wages and no rights.

2030
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:14,380
And that's not something that we find
acceptable.

2031
01:24:14,381 --> 01:24:17,470
It's crazy dude.
American employers also need to take

2032
01:24:17,471 --> 01:24:18,340
responsibility.
Yeah,

2033
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:21,370
I mean I just scribbled down like I was
doing homework in seventh grade and

2034
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:24,140
think about what he said there.
We have to secure the border,

2035
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:26,380
secure the border trunk,
secure the border,

2036
01:24:27,110 --> 01:24:30,740
punish you if you hire,
if you hire illegal workers,

2037
01:24:31,010 --> 01:24:32,520
if you,
if you enter illegally,

2038
01:24:32,530 --> 01:24:34,370
you're showing disregard for our laws.
You,

2039
01:24:34,371 --> 01:24:36,890
we cannot allow illegals to pour in.
Uh,

2040
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:39,920
we can't let them go ahead of lawful
people who are trying to enter the

2041
01:24:39,921 --> 01:24:41,750
country.
We need better border security,

2042
01:24:41,751 --> 01:24:44,150
more pr,
more process and deportations.

2043
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:45,770
Uh,
we have to better manage legal

2044
01:24:45,771 --> 01:24:47,720
immigration.
And then he talked about the millions

2045
01:24:47,721 --> 01:24:49,370
that are here now,
which in effect is a pathway to

2046
01:24:49,371 --> 01:24:50,420
citizenship,
which by the way,

2047
01:24:50,421 --> 01:24:53,570
trump is basically four at some level.
So it's like,

2048
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:58,220
so what are we really talking about?
Every time we scream that everybody is

2049
01:24:58,221 --> 01:24:59,750
racist?
It did.

2050
01:24:59,751 --> 01:25:02,030
He just make a wild what,
sorry.

2051
01:25:02,031 --> 01:25:03,410
I assume he's talking about Latino
people.

2052
01:25:03,411 --> 01:25:07,310
So as Barack Obama racist against Latino
people.

2053
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:10,770
Well this was when he was a senator
Ellis.

2054
01:25:10,790 --> 01:25:15,790
Like he was elected in 2008 and so he
was probably gearing up to run when he

2055
01:25:16,911 --> 01:25:18,980
was in 2005 the things that he was
saying,

2056
01:25:18,981 --> 01:25:22,490
he was letting people know who he is and
that he's out there and starting the

2057
01:25:22,491 --> 01:25:27,491
ball rolling.
You know this a different time to 2005

2058
01:25:28,671 --> 01:25:32,570
was just a different world and it seems
like it shouldn't be because it was only

2059
01:25:32,571 --> 01:25:34,820
13 years ago,
but God damn is it different?

2060
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,180
So what does that say then?
What,

2061
01:25:36,181 --> 01:25:39,890
what does that actually say about the
way things have changed or the cult of

2062
01:25:39,891 --> 01:25:44,720
personality around trump or just sort of
the general derangement of the media

2063
01:25:44,721 --> 01:25:47,420
that they can't view these things.
It's not just a media.

2064
01:25:47,421 --> 01:25:50,090
I think it's also people's access to
communication.

2065
01:25:50,091 --> 01:25:53,030
The fact that anyone can voice their
opinion,

2066
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:55,790
whether it's on facebook or youtube or
what have you,

2067
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:56,741
you know,
it's,

2068
01:25:56,741 --> 01:25:58,550
it's a different world.
Twitter,

2069
01:25:58,580 --> 01:26:00,830
you can just,
you can just tweet instantaneously.

2070
01:26:00,831 --> 01:26:02,390
This is fucking bullshit.
You know,

2071
01:26:02,391 --> 01:26:04,190
people should be able to whatever they
want or whatever,

2072
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:05,210
you know,
whatever you want to say.

2073
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:09,160
And then a bunch of people can agree or
disagree or retweeted or do you know or

2074
01:26:09,161 --> 01:26:13,460
or or screen grab it because they think
that it's damaging to you and they put

2075
01:26:13,461 --> 01:26:15,080
a,
can't believe you support this piece of

2076
01:26:15,081 --> 01:26:17,960
shit and think about it.
You can wake up on any given morning,

2077
01:26:17,961 --> 01:26:20,810
find someone you've never heard of who
said something you slightly disagree

2078
01:26:20,811 --> 01:26:22,730
with and you can help get them fired.
That's a lot of,

2079
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,400
there's a lot of people want to do that
too,

2080
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:27,980
which is really interesting that people
want to get people fired for opinions.

2081
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:30,380
Does that doesn't make a lot of sense to
me,

2082
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:32,360
but really if we were to do a deep dive
on that,

2083
01:26:32,361 --> 01:26:34,910
it's like,
well what did we just hear that is

2084
01:26:34,911 --> 01:26:37,400
different than what trump is trying to
do right now?

2085
01:26:37,410 --> 01:26:38,930
Does trump you sloppy language?

2086
01:26:38,930 --> 01:26:40,220
Yes.
Does trump lie?

2087
01:26:40,221 --> 01:26:41,750
Yes,
but they all lie.

2088
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:43,430
Obama,
if you like your doctor,

2089
01:26:43,431 --> 01:26:46,180
you can keep your doctor lie Siri or red
line the lie.

2090
01:26:46,181 --> 01:26:50,150
Those are pretty big lies that he did
not as trump lie about everything

2091
01:26:50,151 --> 01:26:51,380
constantly.
Yes,

2092
01:26:51,381 --> 01:26:55,070
but what he has a way of doing is
getting these odd big picture things

2093
01:26:55,220 --> 01:26:57,090
correct.
And then it causes this.

2094
01:26:58,430 --> 01:27:02,120
So like almost anything.
So like they'll say you okay.

2095
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:03,590
You know,
just in the last couple of days with

2096
01:27:03,591 --> 01:27:06,920
North Korea that trump said,
um,

2097
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:09,180
I've been traveling a lot.
So like getting the exact quote,

2098
01:27:09,181 --> 01:27:10,880
it'll be tough,
but it'll be something like,

2099
01:27:10,910 --> 01:27:12,830
um,
you know,

2100
01:27:12,831 --> 01:27:15,250
trump said to the North Korean dictator
that they are,

2101
01:27:15,290 --> 01:27:17,180
that they're good friends now or
something like that.

2102
01:27:17,181 --> 01:27:19,340
Like he's already giving him respect.
Well,

2103
01:27:19,341 --> 01:27:21,110
it's like if Obama,
Obama,

2104
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:23,300
when Obama ran,
he said he would sit down with aqua,

2105
01:27:23,301 --> 01:27:25,970
Diana died and he would sit down with
the leaders in North Korea and the rest

2106
01:27:25,971 --> 01:27:26,360
of those things.

2107
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:27,920
Now trump is doing it.
So it's like,

2108
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:31,160
do you want him to sit down with them
and tell him to go fuck himself at the

2109
01:27:31,161 --> 01:27:33,150
same time?
Like I'm not even saying this things

2110
01:27:33,170 --> 01:27:34,970
good or bad.
I have no freaking clue.

2111
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,360
Nobody has a clue.
But everyone has every opinion on

2112
01:27:38,361 --> 01:27:39,230
everything.
Well,

2113
01:27:39,231 --> 01:27:42,310
people want them to fail too,
which is fascinating to me because you

2114
01:27:42,330 --> 01:27:43,880
see the Bill Maher side?
No.

2115
01:27:43,910 --> 01:27:48,680
So Bill Maher on Bill Maher on Friday.
He said that he's hoping for a recession

2116
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:50,870
because that's how we'll get rid of
trump.

2117
01:27:51,530 --> 01:27:54,020
Now.
We talked a little bit about bill before

2118
01:27:54,021 --> 01:27:54,710
this thing,
but like,

2119
01:27:54,710 --> 01:27:56,690
oh my God,
he's been a huge influence of mine.

2120
01:27:56,691 --> 01:27:58,340
I like him.
I used to want to be on the show.

2121
01:27:58,341 --> 01:28:00,080
I've kind of moved past that at this
point,

2122
01:28:00,350 --> 01:28:01,340
but think about it,
you know,

2123
01:28:01,341 --> 01:28:03,170
Bill is probably worth a hundred million
bucks or something.

2124
01:28:03,170 --> 01:28:06,590
I have no idea,
but like he can afford living through a

2125
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:09,050
recession,
but when people talk about the liberal

2126
01:28:09,051 --> 01:28:11,540
elite that they hate,
it's that type of person.

2127
01:28:11,541 --> 01:28:13,040
It's this person on the coast who's
like,

2128
01:28:13,041 --> 01:28:13,820
yeah,
yeah,

2129
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:15,500
have a recession so we can get rid of
trump.

2130
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:20,030
I hope he does amazingly well.
I agree.

2131
01:28:20,031 --> 01:28:23,570
I hope trump does amazing the well in
terms of country when I hope he evolves

2132
01:28:23,571 --> 01:28:25,940
his ideas as a human being.
I hope he does.

2133
01:28:25,941 --> 01:28:30,050
Mushrooms
grows to love people.

2134
01:28:30,051 --> 01:28:33,900
Why would you hope for failure?
Especially failure for the whole country

2135
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:36,800
and sending people into a recession,
which is undoubtedly going to cause

2136
01:28:36,801 --> 01:28:41,540
suicides and turmoil and crisis,
and people are going to go into panic

2137
01:28:41,541 --> 01:28:44,570
thinking and panic voting,
which is not what you want.

2138
01:28:44,571 --> 01:28:46,790
I mean,
literally that's what started Hitler.

2139
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:47,671
I mean that,
that,

2140
01:28:47,671 --> 01:28:49,550
that's what started Nazi Germany,
right?

2141
01:28:49,551 --> 01:28:53,040
They were in the middle of a horrible
recession and this guy came along that

2142
01:28:53,150 --> 01:28:56,540
proposed a solution.
You're not going to get a better version

2143
01:28:56,990 --> 01:29:01,740
of the future by people living in fear
and poverty and sadness.

2144
01:29:01,741 --> 01:29:02,490
Like

2145
01:29:02,490 --> 01:29:06,330
I as
I didn't vote for trump,

2146
01:29:06,331 --> 01:29:08,700
but he's the president I want him to do
great.

2147
01:29:09,150 --> 01:29:12,450
I don't agree with him on a lot of shit.
He lies about a lot of shit.

2148
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,070
Yeah.
Still want them to do great.

2149
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:17,340
You know why?
Because he is the guy that's running the

2150
01:29:17,341 --> 01:29:20,520
country visa running the country.
I want the country to do well no matter

2151
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:22,530
who's running it like that.
My,

2152
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:25,430
my thought was like this,
this is almost what it's like.

2153
01:29:25,431 --> 01:29:26,880
It's like,
I don't like this doctor,

2154
01:29:27,030 --> 01:29:29,280
so when he fixes my knee,
I hope you box it up.

2155
01:29:29,310 --> 01:29:30,210
Right.
That's it.

2156
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:32,730
That's it.
It's really almost what it's like.

2157
01:29:32,731 --> 01:29:35,430
It's like he's the God damn president.
Okay.

2158
01:29:35,431 --> 01:29:37,950
If you want him to be in peach,
because he's done some fucking horrible

2159
01:29:37,951 --> 01:29:39,990
crime,
which I still,

2160
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:44,410
I've gone over all this Russian stuff.
I still am not convinced that he did

2161
01:29:44,411 --> 01:29:45,150
anything horrible.

2162
01:29:45,150 --> 01:29:47,220
I don't see,
it seems like the Democrats did more

2163
01:29:47,221 --> 01:29:50,010
horrible things.
Definitely aiming caught on something.

2164
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:53,340
They definitely did something.
And just what they did to Bernie Sanders

2165
01:29:53,341 --> 01:29:58,290
alone should be a devastating blow to
the credibility of the DNC.

2166
01:29:58,291 --> 01:29:59,280
It really should.
Yeah.

2167
01:29:59,610 --> 01:30:01,470
And the fact that it's not,
it's just,

2168
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:04,860
it's just blind allegiance and that he
could say,

2169
01:30:04,910 --> 01:30:07,110
I hope for a recession.
Maybe he said that without thinking,

2170
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:09,030
you know,
maybe it was just a flipping remark or,

2171
01:30:09,031 --> 01:30:10,620
you know,
I'm pretty sure it was a,

2172
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:13,110
it was a package line.
Never hope for a recession,

2173
01:30:13,140 --> 01:30:15,720
no matter what.
I would hope the guy does fantastic.

2174
01:30:15,930 --> 01:30:19,350
Even if he's hated across the board.
I hope he does an amazing job.

2175
01:30:19,351 --> 01:30:22,290
And I hope the economy sores and I hope
people have more jobs,

2176
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:24,300
more.
I hope there's a method to his madness.

2177
01:30:24,301 --> 01:30:26,640
I really do.
Why would anybody hope differently?

2178
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:27,600
I don't understand.
Well,

2179
01:30:27,601 --> 01:30:30,150
I agree with that and basically,
and again,

2180
01:30:30,151 --> 01:30:31,620
I voted for Gary Johnson.
Look,

2181
01:30:31,621 --> 01:30:33,750
if I had my choice,
I'm pretty sure you know me well enough.

2182
01:30:33,751 --> 01:30:38,040
Like I would much rather have like a
really bright intellectual person who

2183
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:40,060
I'd rather have randon I,
yeah,

2184
01:30:40,090 --> 01:30:42,480
I'd much rather have rand Paul.
I'd rather have a libertarian who

2185
01:30:42,481 --> 01:30:44,580
basically is kicking everything back to
the states.

2186
01:30:44,581 --> 01:30:46,530
But you know what?
Trump is cutting a ton of regulation and

2187
01:30:46,531 --> 01:30:49,350
doing a lot of states rights stuff.
The economy's doing really well.

2188
01:30:49,530 --> 01:30:52,350
Do you have any sense that we're going
to get into something tractable war in

2189
01:30:52,351 --> 01:30:55,530
the Middle East to nation build?
I don't think under his watch there may

2190
01:30:55,531 --> 01:30:59,880
be some level of some peace now in the
North Korean Peninsula.

2191
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:01,500
So it's like thing,
man,

2192
01:31:01,570 --> 01:31:03,900
I don't think anybody else would have
done what he did with North Korea.

2193
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:05,970
So talked to a bunch of shit to that
guy.

2194
01:31:06,170 --> 01:31:08,370
I'm going to call him fat short.
And you know,

2195
01:31:08,371 --> 01:31:12,180
like it was very funny.
Like what he does is kind of funny and

2196
01:31:12,181 --> 01:31:15,900
then he gets to have a meeting with the
guy and the guy agrees to a meeting with

2197
01:31:15,901 --> 01:31:17,340
it.
I think they're baffled by him.

2198
01:31:17,550 --> 01:31:20,040
They don't know what to do with him.
North Korea and South Korea,

2199
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:25,041
when the presidents of the two countries
met at the DMZ and shook hands like that

2200
01:31:25,141 --> 01:31:27,930
was an historic moment.
Like maybe they can get past all this

2201
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:29,940
fucking bullshit that's been going on
forever.

2202
01:31:29,941 --> 01:31:34,470
And if part of that was helped in some
way by trump being crazy,

2203
01:31:34,710 --> 01:31:38,040
like maybe it's good to have someone
that fucks things up a little bit and

2204
01:31:38,041 --> 01:31:40,260
mixes it up.
It doesn't mean he's a perfect person.

2205
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:45,210
It doesn't mean he's not a liar,
right wing conservative neocon Joe

2206
01:31:45,210 --> 01:31:46,470
Rogan,
but Nigga about it.

2207
01:31:46,471 --> 01:31:47,580
So they'd be like,
what does he do?

2208
01:31:47,581 --> 01:31:50,000
So he brings in John Bolton,
who's thought of as a neo-con,

2209
01:31:50,070 --> 01:31:53,520
like a warmonger Neil Kahn,
and then he has madison as the secretary

2210
01:31:53,521 --> 01:31:56,700
of defense.
Warmonger neo-con maybe what he was

2211
01:31:56,701 --> 01:31:59,470
doing is that he was scaring people from
the get go.

2212
01:31:59,471 --> 01:32:00,130
And I'm going to bring

2213
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:01,900
in all these people who are really
scary,

2214
01:32:01,901 --> 01:32:04,330
who don't talk about peace that often,
who don't,

2215
01:32:04,331 --> 01:32:09,331
who talk about exercising our power and
all of that stuff so that Kim Jong Un is

2216
01:32:09,671 --> 01:32:12,730
going to go,
hmm maybe this time they are actually

2217
01:32:12,731 --> 01:32:14,970
being,
they might actually depose me cause I

2218
01:32:14,971 --> 01:32:15,481
don't.
Yeah,

2219
01:32:15,481 --> 01:32:17,340
he's looking at the trump is like this
guy's fucking crazy.

2220
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:19,270
And by the way,
this is where I would say my,

2221
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:21,790
my side in this,
the libertarian side is pretty weak on

2222
01:32:21,791 --> 01:32:24,190
this cause a guy like ran Paul.
What he would say is,

2223
01:32:24,310 --> 01:32:26,020
you know,
we should be cutting all military and

2224
01:32:26,021 --> 01:32:29,170
never doing anything about law,
in which case you can make a strong

2225
01:32:29,171 --> 01:32:31,750
argument that you're constantly
emboldening your enemies all the time

2226
01:32:31,930 --> 01:32:34,660
because if they know you never want to
do anything,

2227
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:38,380
then it's not a great argument to get
bad actors to stop doing things.

2228
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:40,050
But I think that's a great place to have
a,

2229
01:32:40,051 --> 01:32:42,540
a good conversation.
And Rand Paul is supported a lot of this

2230
01:32:42,541 --> 01:32:45,100
stuff trump has done at the same time.
Yeah.

2231
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:46,700
Um,
I'm gonna just,

2232
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:50,140
I just don't understand the logic behind
wanting a recession when I can

2233
01:32:50,141 --> 01:32:53,500
understand the logic around wanting
someone else to take over in two years

2234
01:32:53,501 --> 01:32:55,570
or three years when the new elections
take place.

2235
01:32:55,571 --> 01:32:57,670
But,
but don't you think things are basically

2236
01:32:57,671 --> 01:33:00,850
going pretty well right now?
Like if you remove the twitter hysteria,

2237
01:33:00,851 --> 01:33:03,250
like remove just like hysteria,
stuff like this.

2238
01:33:03,251 --> 01:33:05,290
He said,
she said like in terms of what's

2239
01:33:05,291 --> 01:33:08,200
happening in the country right now,
black and Latino unemployment all time

2240
01:33:08,201 --> 01:33:11,130
low economies chugging along,
um,

2241
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:16,200
like the basic things that matter for a
society are working.

2242
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:19,740
That's pretty good,
right?

2243
01:33:19,741 --> 01:33:21,700
It's now really good.
I don't know enough about this,

2244
01:33:21,701 --> 01:33:26,290
but what I've understood what I've,
what's been explained to me is that a

2245
01:33:26,291 --> 01:33:30,760
lot of this is the momentum of what
Obama did when he was in office and that

2246
01:33:30,761 --> 01:33:33,700
the economy,
he's riding the work of Obama,

2247
01:33:33,701 --> 01:33:37,630
there's riding the wave of the previous
administration's policies.

2248
01:33:37,630 --> 01:33:38,463
So I've,
I've,

2249
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:41,500
yeah,
I've had a economists on my show argued

2250
01:33:41,530 --> 01:33:44,830
kind of both sides of this thing.
Most don't agree with that,

2251
01:33:44,831 --> 01:33:47,980
but I've had probably more libertarian
leaning economist in general.

2252
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:50,800
Well because they're all about cutting
regulation all the time and trump has

2253
01:33:50,801 --> 01:33:52,570
been very good at that.
I think it's something like,

2254
01:33:52,571 --> 01:33:55,550
at one point it was like for every 63
um,

2255
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:59,320
or for every one regulation he passed,
he cuts something like 63 regulations.

2256
01:33:59,470 --> 01:34:02,650
So if you're a libertarian economic
economist or someone on the right

2257
01:34:03,010 --> 01:34:05,740
economically you want the government out
of all of that stuff.

2258
01:34:05,741 --> 01:34:09,370
So they're very happy at the,
at the economic level right now.

2259
01:34:10,110 --> 01:34:11,920
But all right.
But let's even say that's completely

2260
01:34:11,921 --> 01:34:15,160
true what you just said there,
that this is all just because of Obama

2261
01:34:15,161 --> 01:34:16,270
stuff.
Well,

2262
01:34:16,271 --> 01:34:18,790
it's working.
Like we've got a guy that maybe has just

2263
01:34:18,791 --> 01:34:22,780
picked up the ball and he's the lucky
guy and maybe he's going to get it to

2264
01:34:22,781 --> 01:34:23,230
the next thing.

2265
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:27,340
But what I'm actually more enthused by
is that I think after all this craziness

2266
01:34:27,341 --> 01:34:31,210
that we're in right now,
I actually think people are so starved

2267
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:36,240
for sanity and like a reset to decency.
I actually think things are going to get

2268
01:34:36,581 --> 01:34:37,690
much better.
I think again,

2269
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:40,570
this is where I think the conversations
that we're all having or are affecting

2270
01:34:40,571 --> 01:34:44,380
things in a big way and I think that
even politically it's going to start

2271
01:34:44,381 --> 01:34:47,050
bubbling up.
I when I was in DC the other day,

2272
01:34:47,051 --> 01:34:51,070
I was at a small dinner with a pretty
influential senator who probably doesn't

2273
01:34:51,071 --> 01:34:54,520
want me to say his name is not going to
say it but I'll tell it to you later.

2274
01:34:54,521 --> 01:34:58,190
But on the river somebody,
it was somebody big and he got it.

2275
01:34:58,540 --> 01:35:01,040
He,
he really got it like he knew about us

2276
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:04,250
like this whole thing and that's what
I'm saying like I'm not sitting here

2277
01:35:04,251 --> 01:35:04,851
like,
oh my God,

2278
01:35:04,851 --> 01:35:05,840
it's so amazing what we're doing.

2279
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:09,290
But there something,
there is something happening and I think

2280
01:35:09,291 --> 01:35:13,610
it will reach the political level too,
that people will not want the hysteria

2281
01:35:13,611 --> 01:35:17,210
anymore and that eventually trump will,
because of his own craziness,

2282
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:20,630
become unnecessary.
You won't always need the icebreaker.

2283
01:35:20,631 --> 01:35:23,630
We needed the icebreaker to get all this
shit out.

2284
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:26,810
Now it's all out.
Everyone's reevaluating everything and

2285
01:35:26,811 --> 01:35:29,300
then out of that is going to grow.
I mean,

2286
01:35:29,301 --> 01:35:30,620
look,
maybe it grows something horrible,

2287
01:35:30,621 --> 01:35:32,000
right?
Like maybe the Hitler comes.

2288
01:35:32,630 --> 01:35:34,850
I don't think,
I obviously hope it doesn't happen,

2289
01:35:34,851 --> 01:35:37,820
but what I think is that something
decent is going to come that that's

2290
01:35:37,821 --> 01:35:38,830
just,
that's just her.

2291
01:35:40,290 --> 01:35:42,600
Something decent is going to come on.
I think there is,

2292
01:35:42,630 --> 01:35:44,880
there's a lot of decent that's coming
right now,

2293
01:35:44,881 --> 01:35:46,890
but I think there's some people that are
always going to resist that.

2294
01:35:47,010 --> 01:35:47,491
Oh,
of course.

2295
01:35:47,491 --> 01:35:50,820
People that are just ideologically
driven and they can't be shaken from

2296
01:35:50,850 --> 01:35:53,040
the,
they can't be shook from that position.

2297
01:35:53,041 --> 01:35:55,560
They just,
they're hard left or they're hard ride

2298
01:35:55,561 --> 01:35:58,440
or whatever they are.
They have this rigid idea in their head

2299
01:35:58,441 --> 01:36:01,710
of what reality is and anything that's
contrary to that,

2300
01:36:01,780 --> 01:36:05,010
they're going to oppose.
And I think Jordan has been one of my

2301
01:36:05,011 --> 01:36:09,960
favorite lightning rods for observation
for watching this because all the

2302
01:36:09,961 --> 01:36:12,690
disingenuous articles about him
deceptive,

2303
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:17,580
talking about his positions and an
extremely inaccurate ways and labeling

2304
01:36:17,581 --> 01:36:21,120
him as some sort of a prejudice,
terrible person.

2305
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:27,020
What those have done is solidified this
idea that there is a campaign of people

2306
01:36:28,790 --> 01:36:33,650
that just are completely ideologically
driven and they don't mind being

2307
01:36:33,651 --> 01:36:34,484
deceptive.

2308
01:36:34,730 --> 01:36:39,170
And that strengthens the puzzle.
It helps people like us that just talk

2309
01:36:39,171 --> 01:36:44,030
about stuff and don't mind talking about
being incorrect or ignorant or not

2310
01:36:44,110 --> 01:36:46,760
worried.
We're not worried about our stance.

2311
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:47,721
We just,
we're,

2312
01:36:47,721 --> 01:36:52,721
we're going about most conversations
from a place of objectivity if it as

2313
01:36:53,841 --> 01:36:56,300
much as we possibly can.
Most people are subjective at least to a

2314
01:36:56,301 --> 01:36:59,210
certain extent,
as much objectivity as we can,

2315
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:01,970
as much honesty as we can.
And just talking about things.

2316
01:37:02,330 --> 01:37:03,680
And this is,
um,

2317
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:07,790
this is something that's not happening
in these little click baity articles or

2318
01:37:07,791 --> 01:37:12,380
in people that interrupt your shows and
shake fucking jars and Nicole's or

2319
01:37:12,381 --> 01:37:14,990
whatever they're doing.
It's like there's that,

2320
01:37:14,991 --> 01:37:18,510
all that stuff's strengthens this
position that we're in,

2321
01:37:18,511 --> 01:37:23,511
that we're in this weird time of
intellectual dishonesty and turmoil.

2322
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:27,780
And I think a lot of it is because
there's a lot of people that were just

2323
01:37:27,781 --> 01:37:31,110
extremely upset that trump got into
office and anything that seems to

2324
01:37:31,111 --> 01:37:34,560
represent that position or that side
must be opposed violence.

2325
01:37:34,660 --> 01:37:36,700
Yeah.
So I think underneath everything you're

2326
01:37:36,701 --> 01:37:37,630
saying,
the right there,

2327
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:40,690
you're very hopeful right now.
I actually sense that you're really

2328
01:37:40,691 --> 01:37:41,830
hopeful.
And I am too.

2329
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:43,690
And it's like,
how could we ever do this if we weren't

2330
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:44,121
right?
Like I,

2331
01:37:44,121 --> 01:37:47,530
I would say that I'm a,
if I had to like sort of widdle it down

2332
01:37:47,531 --> 01:37:48,940
what I am at,
at the core,

2333
01:37:49,330 --> 01:37:51,600
I basically,
I'm a world weary optimist.

2334
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:54,970
I'm an optimist by nature.
But I believe that the world,

2335
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:58,500
the world is rough and tumble and all
the things that Jordan would say about

2336
01:37:58,501 --> 01:37:59,970
existence,
I believe.

2337
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:03,990
But I'm still an optimist.
Despite that and what you just said,

2338
01:38:03,991 --> 01:38:08,880
right there basically is showing that
the trump thing was necessary because

2339
01:38:08,881 --> 01:38:12,560
imagine if hillary was president right
now in the same machine and bullshit and

2340
01:38:12,561 --> 01:38:15,840
nonsense and media and all of that stuff
kept churning along.

2341
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:19,200
Think how much worse it would be for
these conversations right now we would

2342
01:38:19,201 --> 01:38:22,380
so beyond the wrongs,
you know the wrong side of things so to

2343
01:38:22,381 --> 01:38:25,560
speak,
and the forces that don't want us to do

2344
01:38:25,561 --> 01:38:28,710
anything good and have conversations
would have been so emboldened.

2345
01:38:28,711 --> 01:38:31,380
Trump just came and took a freaking bat
to the whole thing.

2346
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:33,330
Now,
as I discussed with Eric Weinstein,

2347
01:38:33,570 --> 01:38:35,430
it's like trump was the bull in the
China shop.

2348
01:38:35,431 --> 01:38:37,590
I think most of us would have preferred
a panther wait,

2349
01:38:37,591 --> 01:38:39,270
like we kind of wanted something to walk
through,

2350
01:38:39,271 --> 01:38:41,850
knock a few things off.
Trump just blew up the whole thing.

2351
01:38:41,851 --> 01:38:43,740
You don't the phrases bull in a China
shop,

2352
01:38:43,741 --> 01:38:45,380
not a panther in a China shop.
That's right.

2353
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:48,300
So that's what you get.
But after this,

2354
01:38:48,870 --> 01:38:53,870
for every reason you just said there is
going to be a return to sanity.

2355
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:55,950
It.
It goes one of two ways,

2356
01:38:55,951 --> 01:38:57,960
but I,
I just am a firm believer that it will

2357
01:38:57,961 --> 01:39:00,240
go that way,
that there is enough of us out there now

2358
01:39:00,241 --> 01:39:03,630
trying to reset things and because I
don't think people are evil.

2359
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:05,430
I don't think people want to be talked
down to.

2360
01:39:05,431 --> 01:39:08,370
I don't think people are dumb and even
the people who are dumb,

2361
01:39:08,371 --> 01:39:11,700
I don't think they want to be dumb and
because of all of that,

2362
01:39:12,570 --> 01:39:15,150
I think this was the necessary thing to
happen right now.

2363
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:19,140
I'm with you that I think,
I hope that he continues to do basically

2364
01:39:19,141 --> 01:39:23,010
good things and that if that means that
he gets in for another four years and

2365
01:39:23,011 --> 01:39:24,840
continues to do good things then so be
it.

2366
01:39:24,841 --> 01:39:28,110
But yes,
would I prefer that it's sort of more of

2367
01:39:28,111 --> 01:39:31,770
a small government calm person who could
tell you how many branches of government

2368
01:39:31,771 --> 01:39:36,270
there are and like all of that shit and
all of the stuff from that flag that's

2369
01:39:36,271 --> 01:39:37,470
right behind you.
Yeah.

2370
01:39:37,650 --> 01:39:40,590
I've got a freaking declaration of
independence in our control room and a

2371
01:39:40,591 --> 01:39:42,690
constitution and a big American flag.
Like,

2372
01:39:42,691 --> 01:39:46,380
would I rather someone who knew what the
federalist papers are and all of those

2373
01:39:46,381 --> 01:39:48,510
things be in the Oval Office?
Yes.

2374
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:51,210
You don't get everything you want in
life,

2375
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:53,910
so you just kind of work with what comes
and I think we can,

2376
01:39:53,940 --> 01:39:56,120
we have a little room to work right now.
I think

2377
01:39:56,180 --> 01:40:01,180
also as more people open themselves up
to the ideas that Jordan is espousing or

2378
01:40:02,031 --> 01:40:06,290
you are,
I am or more people are genuinely

2379
01:40:06,350 --> 01:40:09,050
objective about these ideas and start
discussing them.

2380
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:14,010
The more frantic the people on the
radical left in the the,

2381
01:40:14,190 --> 01:40:16,070
what would they call the regressive
left,

2382
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:19,470
the more ridiculous they're going to get
and the more obvious it's going to get

2383
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:21,470
that they're out of control.
It's just what happens.

2384
01:40:21,471 --> 01:40:24,480
People Start Ranting and screaming
louder because the,

2385
01:40:24,481 --> 01:40:26,960
their initial meshes doesn't work.
It's not like they're going to go back

2386
01:40:26,961 --> 01:40:29,510
and revamp the message and make it more
logical.

2387
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:32,540
There's no logical message there,
but think about that.

2388
01:40:32,541 --> 01:40:34,970
So when that's exactly what they're
doing with trump too.

2389
01:40:34,971 --> 01:40:36,740
You keep screaming trump's Hitler,
right?

2390
01:40:36,741 --> 01:40:38,300
He keeps screaming,
trump's Hitler,

2391
01:40:38,301 --> 01:40:39,060
Hitler,
Hitler.

2392
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:41,010
Now,
Hitler killed millions and millions of

2393
01:40:41,011 --> 01:40:43,620
people in many more millions were killed
because of Hitler that he didn't

2394
01:40:43,621 --> 01:40:45,120
directly kill.
Now,

2395
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:49,020
if you keep doing that with trump,
and then someone plays that Barack Obama

2396
01:40:49,021 --> 01:40:50,740
clip and you go,
wait,

2397
01:40:50,741 --> 01:40:51,011
whoa,
whoa,

2398
01:40:51,011 --> 01:40:52,940
Whoa,
you're calling trump Hitler.

2399
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:56,290
Here's Obama saying something that
actually sounds possibly even more

2400
01:40:56,291 --> 01:40:58,300
extreme.
If you believe this is an extreme

2401
01:40:58,301 --> 01:41:00,070
position to take.
So now is,

2402
01:41:00,130 --> 01:41:02,920
is Obama Hiller.
And what they're doing is they're

2403
01:41:02,921 --> 01:41:07,330
creating a situation where they're going
to cause a rebound so that people will

2404
01:41:07,331 --> 01:41:08,164
be like,
oh,

2405
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:10,930
these guys aren't all nuts.
But if they,

2406
01:41:11,290 --> 01:41:14,170
if they destroy all of our ability to
have this conversation,

2407
01:41:14,590 --> 01:41:17,560
then when the real Hitler comes in,
we won't even be able to recognize it

2408
01:41:17,561 --> 01:41:20,860
because they will have cried wolf to the
point that someone's going to come in

2409
01:41:20,861 --> 01:41:23,920
and they're gonna have a big smile.
It won't be a trump win when Hitler,

2410
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:26,140
the Hitler type,
and I hate using Hitler as the,

2411
01:41:26,141 --> 01:41:27,820
as the metaphor,
cause it's so overplayed.

2412
01:41:27,820 --> 01:41:32,820
But like when the Hitler type comes,
it ain't come in as the angry guy like

2413
01:41:33,551 --> 01:41:35,680
trump is.
It's going to come with a smile on its

2414
01:41:35,681 --> 01:41:36,161
face,
right?

2415
01:41:36,161 --> 01:41:37,930
That's that socialist tee shirt like you
know,

2416
01:41:37,931 --> 01:41:39,160
socialism,
Smiley face.

2417
01:41:39,370 --> 01:41:43,030
That's how it will come because it will
be masked in identity politics.

2418
01:41:43,031 --> 01:41:46,690
It will be masked in all of this
nonsense that will rip us apart.

2419
01:41:46,691 --> 01:41:48,850
That will literally have us killing each
other on the streets.

2420
01:41:49,010 --> 01:41:52,840
What do you think would cause a,
what scenario do you foresee?

2421
01:41:52,841 --> 01:41:57,841
There could be possibly if the extreme,
the ideas of what I consider the fringe

2422
01:41:58,691 --> 01:42:01,060
left,
which are pretty much mainstream

2423
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:04,300
Democrat ideas already.
If the Democrats keep going more towards

2424
01:42:04,301 --> 01:42:05,500
the Bernie,
Elizabeth Warren,

2425
01:42:05,501 --> 01:42:09,370
Keith Ellison,
real hard left progressive stuff.

2426
01:42:09,710 --> 01:42:12,340
It is rooted in identity politics,
which I,

2427
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:15,760
you know we've done already but like it
is rooted in something that separates

2428
01:42:15,761 --> 01:42:16,030
us.

2429
01:42:16,030 --> 01:42:18,310
It is rooted that you should that even
today.

2430
01:42:18,311 --> 01:42:19,390
Did you see this,
that Harvard,

2431
01:42:19,391 --> 01:42:20,860
I just tweeted out when I was on the way
here,

2432
01:42:21,130 --> 01:42:24,880
Harvard released this statement of
defending the fact that they are okay

2433
01:42:24,881 --> 01:42:29,230
with basically having quotas that work
against Asian students because they want

2434
01:42:29,231 --> 01:42:34,231
to have more other minorities basically
meaning black or Hispanic minorities.

2435
01:42:35,260 --> 01:42:38,080
So think about it.
Why would you discriminate if you are

2436
01:42:38,081 --> 01:42:39,910
hiring right now,
let's say you're hiring today,

2437
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:42,010
right?
You're hiring for your studio,

2438
01:42:42,730 --> 01:42:44,800
you can hire,
you can hire the most qualified person.

2439
01:42:44,801 --> 01:42:47,920
Are you going to try to figure out every
little identity thing to figure out who

2440
01:42:47,921 --> 01:42:49,150
you should hire?
Diversity,

2441
01:42:49,151 --> 01:42:51,230
Bro,
I'm all about diversity.

2442
01:42:51,490 --> 01:42:52,540
Exactly.
You'd hire,

2443
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:56,740
it's racist against Asians.
Just haven't been very vocal about it

2444
01:42:56,741 --> 01:42:59,620
cause they,
they tend to just put their fucking nose

2445
01:42:59,621 --> 01:43:02,800
to the grindstone and keep ticking out
so they have to use that against them.

2446
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:04,720
Now that works so that that's the new
thing.

2447
01:43:04,721 --> 01:43:06,610
You will not be a,
if you're Asian and you,

2448
01:43:06,611 --> 01:43:09,250
and why did they,
why did Asian Americans are Indian

2449
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:12,520
Americans are a great example that they
have succeeded at every level that we

2450
01:43:12,521 --> 01:43:15,010
measure success.
I think the highest socioeconomic

2451
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:17,980
average salary over a hundred grand and
no education,

2452
01:43:17,981 --> 01:43:18,814
et Cetera,
et cetera.

2453
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:20,650
If you now say,
well wait a minute,

2454
01:43:20,651 --> 01:43:23,470
these people played by the rules,
they came here as it most,

2455
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:23,980
you know,
like,

2456
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:27,400
like all of our ancestors virtually came
here pretty much with nothing.

2457
01:43:27,401 --> 01:43:29,590
People on small businesses busted their
ass,

2458
01:43:29,591 --> 01:43:32,200
worked in coal mines,
it's said wherever you had to do it,

2459
01:43:32,530 --> 01:43:36,430
if you do all of those things and then
you focus on education and on family and

2460
01:43:36,431 --> 01:43:38,890
all of those things.
And now the system is going to say,

2461
01:43:38,891 --> 01:43:42,160
well it worked for a while,
but we're going to have to put you at

2462
01:43:42,161 --> 01:43:43,330
the bottom of the thing now.

2463
01:43:43,330 --> 01:43:44,860
And you guess what?
You're not going to get into Harvard

2464
01:43:44,861 --> 01:43:47,800
because you're Asian.
That is racism.

2465
01:43:47,801 --> 01:43:51,830
So I've been calling this out for at
least two years that the next move by

2466
01:43:51,860 --> 01:43:56,120
this identity politics,
this evil oppression Olympics machine is

2467
01:43:56,121 --> 01:43:58,970
that they will come after Asian people
and it's starting to happen now.

2468
01:43:59,090 --> 01:44:01,040
So I see all these minorities,
by the way.

2469
01:44:01,041 --> 01:44:02,390
So candace,
who,

2470
01:44:02,391 --> 01:44:05,210
I watched the show and I know you guys
definitely have disagreements on stuff

2471
01:44:05,390 --> 01:44:08,510
as do I do when it comes not only to
politics but tactics sometimes and

2472
01:44:08,511 --> 01:44:09,770
stuff,
but I really do like her.

2473
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:11,210
Um,
you know,

2474
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:13,550
look,
she's causing a massive rift in the

2475
01:44:13,551 --> 01:44:15,410
black community and you can see it in
the numbers.

2476
01:44:15,411 --> 01:44:17,990
Black male support for trump or for
trump?

2477
01:44:17,991 --> 01:44:21,620
Doubled it was at 11% it's 22 no one.
Well,

2478
01:44:21,621 --> 01:44:23,780
it's Kanye.
Kanye was the wrecking machine,

2479
01:44:23,781 --> 01:44:26,090
but I actually think,
I think in the grand scheme of things

2480
01:44:26,091 --> 01:44:27,530
can't,
candace is much bigger.

2481
01:44:27,650 --> 01:44:31,820
I really believe that in terms of,
because I think she could be a direct

2482
01:44:31,821 --> 01:44:35,840
line to all of the political parts of
this if she decides to go that route

2483
01:44:35,841 --> 01:44:39,200
because I think she could,
I think she could run for Senate or,

2484
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:40,550
yeah.
Yeah.

2485
01:44:41,130 --> 01:44:41,963
I,
I can't,

2486
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:45,450
I'm not high today.
Not,

2487
01:44:45,530 --> 01:44:48,650
I'm only smoking maybe once a week on
Sundays and now and now I'm on tour so

2488
01:44:48,651 --> 01:44:50,690
I'm not really at all,
but let us park up at joint and have you

2489
01:44:50,691 --> 01:44:54,080
reconsidered what you just said?
You can smoke a joint and maybe I'll

2490
01:44:54,081 --> 01:44:56,060
reconsider.
Said you watched the podcast I did with

2491
01:44:56,061 --> 01:44:56,830
her.
Yeah.

2492
01:44:56,830 --> 01:44:57,670
Yeah.
I watch,

2493
01:44:57,690 --> 01:44:59,240
I don't know.
Maybe at least at least an hour and a

2494
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:00,310
half of it or so.
Yeah.

2495
01:45:00,410 --> 01:45:02,000
Why?
Why?

2496
01:45:02,050 --> 01:45:05,420
What?
I don't know why you saying it that way

2497
01:45:05,450 --> 01:45:06,980
because I don't think she should run for
Senate.

2498
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:07,250
No,
no.

2499
01:45:07,250 --> 01:45:11,360
I'm not saying she's a,
a young girl with some interesting ideas

2500
01:45:11,361 --> 01:45:12,390
and she's got a lot of passion.

2501
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:13,233
I know.
I didn't say,

2502
01:45:13,730 --> 01:45:15,950
I didn't say you think she should.
I even say I think she's here.

2503
01:45:15,980 --> 01:45:19,760
I think she could have a bigger effect.
Even then Kanye,

2504
01:45:19,761 --> 01:45:22,120
when it comes to just everything going
on politically,

2505
01:45:22,121 --> 01:45:23,990
I'm going to ask you again,
this girl,

2506
01:45:24,410 --> 01:45:26,240
she wants it.
She wants it,

2507
01:45:26,241 --> 01:45:27,350
man.
Sure she does,

2508
01:45:27,351 --> 01:45:29,570
but when you share affecting people in a
big way,

2509
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:33,430
I think maybe in a bigger way than then
perhaps either one of us don't

2510
01:45:33,431 --> 01:45:35,950
understand,
but my butt forgetting candace

2511
01:45:36,020 --> 01:45:37,820
specifically.
My point.

2512
01:45:37,821 --> 01:45:40,100
My point was nice person.
Yeah.

2513
01:45:40,130 --> 01:45:44,030
My point was though that I think all
minority groups are reevaluating what's

2514
01:45:44,031 --> 01:45:45,530
going on here.
If you're in the black community,

2515
01:45:45,531 --> 01:45:49,130
clearly there is at the moment a
reevaluation of do we have to be

2516
01:45:49,131 --> 01:45:50,800
democratic?
If you're,

2517
01:45:50,930 --> 01:45:52,070
that is an issue.
Yeah.

2518
01:45:52,190 --> 01:45:53,570
It's a,
it's a racist issue.

2519
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:55,550
Yes.
Because people assume that if you're

2520
01:45:55,551 --> 01:45:57,230
black,
you must be a democrat.

2521
01:45:57,230 --> 01:45:58,820
If you're not,
you're some sort of an uncle Tom.

2522
01:45:59,120 --> 01:46:00,260
It's kind of fucked up.
Yeah.

2523
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:01,610
Talk to my friends,
Larry Elder,

2524
01:46:01,611 --> 01:46:03,800
I had thomas soul on the show or my
buddy David Webb,

2525
01:46:03,801 --> 01:46:04,491
or,
or many of,

2526
01:46:04,491 --> 01:46:09,050
there are many black conservatives.
Sure you are allowed to think however

2527
01:46:09,051 --> 01:46:10,670
you want it despite your skin color.
Right?

2528
01:46:10,671 --> 01:46:13,280
So I think the black community,
Ben Carson,

2529
01:46:13,281 --> 01:46:15,590
I mean I think the black community
starting to split,

2530
01:46:15,591 --> 01:46:19,640
I think the gay community starting to
split because the left has sort of had

2531
01:46:19,641 --> 01:46:22,910
this odd embracement of Islam,
which is bad for gays.

2532
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,530
So I think the gays are starting to
split.

2533
01:46:24,531 --> 01:46:26,120
I think that,
uh,

2534
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:29,180
Latinos are even starting to split a
little bit differently because I think

2535
01:46:29,390 --> 01:46:31,160
for all the people that came here
legally,

2536
01:46:31,310 --> 01:46:34,460
they're actually not as thrilled with
illegal immigration as the media may

2537
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:37,910
imply that they are.
So I think there's just massive shifts

2538
01:46:37,911 --> 01:46:42,320
happening all over the place.
And the way we look at voting where

2539
01:46:42,321 --> 01:46:43,790
every election,
you know,

2540
01:46:43,910 --> 01:46:46,220
what's his name?
John King goes on CNN and shows you the

2541
01:46:46,221 --> 01:46:47,240
map and he goes,
well,

2542
01:46:47,241 --> 01:46:50,130
the white working class people here
voted this way and the black inner

2543
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:52,650
city people.
But I think all of that is about to

2544
01:46:52,651 --> 01:46:56,430
explode and they won't know what to do
because they haven't been listening.

2545
01:46:56,431 --> 01:46:58,920
But I think some others have them.
Listen,

2546
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:01,560
there's real room in this country for a
third party.

2547
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:04,560
I mean,
I think for sure someone could take a

2548
01:47:04,561 --> 01:47:06,960
position that's outside those two boxes.
Yeah.

2549
01:47:06,990 --> 01:47:10,650
And and make some real valid points and
have a little bit of ideas from each

2550
01:47:10,651 --> 01:47:12,810
side.
But the real concern,

2551
01:47:12,811 --> 01:47:15,450
this country seems to be throwing your
vote away,

2552
01:47:15,810 --> 01:47:17,220
right?
That's the thing that people were always

2553
01:47:17,221 --> 01:47:18,031
worried about.
Well,

2554
01:47:18,031 --> 01:47:20,100
if you go that way,
you're throwing your vote away and

2555
01:47:20,101 --> 01:47:23,640
you're essentially giving it to the
person that is on the other side.

2556
01:47:24,090 --> 01:47:25,950
I used to kind of buy into that,
right?

2557
01:47:25,951 --> 01:47:29,070
Cause realistically within,
but this is why I was so disappointed in

2558
01:47:29,071 --> 01:47:31,710
Gary Johnson.
Every half the country hated hillary,

2559
01:47:31,711 --> 01:47:34,740
half the country hated trump at at the
highest levels that you could hate a

2560
01:47:34,741 --> 01:47:35,190
candidate.

2561
01:47:35,190 --> 01:47:37,410
Right.
So if there was ever a time for just a

2562
01:47:37,411 --> 01:47:38,890
decent guy,
right?

2563
01:47:38,980 --> 01:47:40,770
Like Gary Johnson's,
just a decent guy.

2564
01:47:40,780 --> 01:47:43,170
If he was here,
like he'd probably want to spark up and

2565
01:47:43,171 --> 01:47:44,160
you know,
and a nice guy,

2566
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:47,310
he's just a nice guy.
But he was such an ineffective,

2567
01:47:47,670 --> 01:47:52,500
confused memory problem.
Couldn't lay out his basic principles

2568
01:47:52,501 --> 01:47:53,370
simply,
you know,

2569
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:56,460
he wanted as a libertarian,
he wanted the baker to bake the cake.

2570
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:59,370
That that's a crazy position to hold as
a libertarian.

2571
01:47:59,550 --> 01:48:01,500
Makes no,
it's completely against.

2572
01:48:01,710 --> 01:48:03,670
What would be your,
uh,

2573
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:06,480
line of thinking as a libertarian,
you would never want the government to

2574
01:48:06,481 --> 01:48:11,280
force someone to do a specific task.
Talking about the gay couple that wanted

2575
01:48:11,281 --> 01:48:12,360
a wedding cake made.
Yeah.

2576
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:14,310
Yeah.
What's your position on that,

2577
01:48:14,311 --> 01:48:15,750
by the way?
Um,

2578
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:19,470
well there's two issues.
One issue is that this,

2579
01:48:19,740 --> 01:48:24,740
they apparently went to places they
thought would deny them so that they can

2580
01:48:24,841 --> 01:48:25,890
make a story out of it.

2581
01:48:25,910 --> 01:48:28,950
Yeah.
It wasn't as simple as a loving couple

2582
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:32,310
went to someplace they wanted to get a
cake made and the people said no.

2583
01:48:32,311 --> 01:48:33,450
And they're like,
what the fuck?

2584
01:48:33,810 --> 01:48:38,160
Now they wanted a story and this,
so they sought out places that they

2585
01:48:38,161 --> 01:48:41,850
thought were going to deny them and then
they made a giant national event out of

2586
01:48:41,851 --> 01:48:45,780
it.
I don't think people should discriminate

2587
01:48:45,781 --> 01:48:48,030
to the point where they're not going to
make someone a cake.

2588
01:48:48,390 --> 01:48:50,160
I mean,
I think there's the government.

2589
01:48:50,250 --> 01:48:52,710
Do you think the government should,
government shouldn't step in?

2590
01:48:52,711 --> 01:48:53,310
No.
Yeah,

2591
01:48:53,310 --> 01:48:57,620
I think you should let people know
publicly these,

2592
01:48:57,630 --> 01:49:00,630
these are people that they discriminate
against gay people.

2593
01:49:00,631 --> 01:49:05,631
And so if you want your dollars to
represent your opinions and your

2594
01:49:06,481 --> 01:49:08,970
feelings on things,
maybe you shouldn't buy a cake from

2595
01:49:08,971 --> 01:49:11,400
these folks that don't want to make a
cake for gay people.

2596
01:49:11,700 --> 01:49:14,040
But the idea of the government's going
to step in.

2597
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:17,790
It seems crazy to me.
But then as soon as I say that,

2598
01:49:17,791 --> 01:49:18,510
I go,
okay,

2599
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:20,760
well what if they wouldn't make a cake
for black people?

2600
01:49:20,940 --> 01:49:22,950
Should the government step in then?
So,

2601
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:24,120
okay,
so there's a couple of things,

2602
01:49:24,180 --> 01:49:25,320
right?
So there's a couple of things there.

2603
01:49:25,321 --> 01:49:28,500
So first off it,
it was about the specifics of the cake.

2604
01:49:28,501 --> 01:49:30,900
I know this guy had a lot of people are
going to get into the nitty gritty of

2605
01:49:30,901 --> 01:49:33,750
every legal part of this thing.
But it was about a specific,

2606
01:49:33,751 --> 01:49:36,420
it wasn't that he wasn't going to sell
them a cake that was on the shelf.

2607
01:49:36,690 --> 01:49:37,620
Right.
Didn't want to make,

2608
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:40,530
he didn't want to make them a cake for
this wedding.

2609
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:44,190
Now that's asking him to do something
that's artistic or that's not,

2610
01:49:44,670 --> 01:49:48,370
what was the variables like that.
You want men.

2611
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:52,330
So I apparently am the conversation
actually never got to that point cause

2612
01:49:52,331 --> 01:49:55,330
he denied them before that because he
knew what it was going to be.

2613
01:49:55,540 --> 01:49:57,010
So it never got to like,
oh,

2614
01:49:57,011 --> 01:49:59,170
are you when you're going to draw us
together or whatever.

2615
01:49:59,171 --> 01:50:00,700
But he knew it was going to be a gay
wedding.

2616
01:50:00,940 --> 01:50:03,550
So let just said no,
I'm not making a cake for a gay wedding

2617
01:50:03,580 --> 01:50:04,361
right now.
Look.

2618
01:50:04,361 --> 01:50:06,130
But they could have bought a cake that
was there.

2619
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:09,040
So like it was an interracial wedding.
Would you have a more of an issue with

2620
01:50:09,041 --> 01:50:10,360
that?
So,

2621
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:12,190
so here's the deal.
So it's,

2622
01:50:12,610 --> 01:50:15,340
look,
we have the civil rights act of 1964.

2623
01:50:15,370 --> 01:50:18,040
You have to serve people based on race
and,

2624
01:50:18,130 --> 01:50:20,320
uh,
all of the minority statuses that there

2625
01:50:20,321 --> 01:50:21,850
are.
I'm not for re litigating that,

2626
01:50:22,060 --> 01:50:23,050
but uh,
but there are,

2627
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:27,340
there is a libertarian argument that
basically would say we don't need those

2628
01:50:27,341 --> 01:50:30,880
laws anymore because the,
the civil rights act was in response to

2629
01:50:30,881 --> 01:50:34,720
Jim Crow laws were states in the south
had discriminatory laws.

2630
01:50:34,810 --> 01:50:37,420
So we had the federal government come in
and clean that up for everybody.

2631
01:50:37,421 --> 01:50:40,960
So you have to serve everyone equally.
You can't deny a black couple to come

2632
01:50:40,961 --> 01:50:44,260
into your restaurant or [inaudible] can
you walk?

2633
01:50:44,261 --> 01:50:46,120
Can you deny a gay person then?
Nope,

2634
01:50:46,180 --> 01:50:48,190
because,
but it was a specific thing.

2635
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:49,930
It was a specific,
so let look put it,

2636
01:50:50,170 --> 01:50:51,400
put it this way.
If you had a,

2637
01:50:51,401 --> 01:50:53,770
if there was a Jewish artist who took
commissions,

2638
01:50:54,100 --> 01:50:55,390
uh,
for paintings,

2639
01:50:55,570 --> 01:50:59,920
would you force that person to bake to
paint Neo Nazi signs?

2640
01:50:59,921 --> 01:51:02,410
Of course not.
You would never have the government come

2641
01:51:02,411 --> 01:51:05,980
in and say that they are forced to paint
something that's against their

2642
01:51:05,981 --> 01:51:08,650
conscience.
So I would say that your original

2643
01:51:08,651 --> 01:51:10,690
position is the right one,
which is,

2644
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:12,610
it kind of sucks,
right?

2645
01:51:12,611 --> 01:51:16,390
It kind of sounds like,
I wish in my heart of hearts I'm gay

2646
01:51:16,391 --> 01:51:16,750
again.

2647
01:51:16,750 --> 01:51:21,220
Like I wish that every Baker would treat
everyone equally and every person would

2648
01:51:21,221 --> 01:51:23,440
treat everyone equally.
They're not allowed.

2649
01:51:23,441 --> 01:51:27,550
He wasn't allowed to deny them something
that was in the store already because

2650
01:51:27,551 --> 01:51:30,640
you can't deny based on those protected
categories.

2651
01:51:30,940 --> 01:51:32,860
So he wouldn't have by the Civil Rights
Act,

2652
01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:37,150
he wouldn't have been allowed to deny a
interracial couple of cake that existed

2653
01:51:37,151 --> 01:51:40,090
there already.
But could he have cody have denied them

2654
01:51:40,091 --> 01:51:42,940
one that he would have had to draw a
black woman and a white woman if he was

2655
01:51:42,941 --> 01:51:46,690
a real racist.
I think the answer is that he could have

2656
01:51:46,691 --> 01:51:50,080
denied them that and that would have
been very shitty and he would be a

2657
01:51:50,081 --> 01:51:54,520
racist and a really awful person.
But if the answer is that the government

2658
01:51:54,521 --> 01:51:57,010
should then come in and tell this man
what to do,

2659
01:51:57,011 --> 01:51:59,920
I would not be for that.
I see what you're saying.

2660
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:01,510
Um,
I just,

2661
01:52:01,511 --> 01:52:04,870
that's just the cleanest way to deal
with this related to freedom.

2662
01:52:05,950 --> 01:52:08,470
It's kind of shitty.
Like freedom is messy.

2663
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:10,780
It's definitely shitty.
It's Shitty.

2664
01:52:10,781 --> 01:52:12,730
And,
but the government can't protect you

2665
01:52:12,731 --> 01:52:15,220
from shitty.
Yeah,

2666
01:52:15,490 --> 01:52:18,170
no,
I mean obviously that's why the KKK is

2667
01:52:18,171 --> 01:52:19,390
still exists.
Yeah.

2668
01:52:19,420 --> 01:52:21,040
And what's the alternative?
I mean,

2669
01:52:21,041 --> 01:52:23,080
what's the alternative?
We would all love the KKK to go away.

2670
01:52:23,081 --> 01:52:24,730
We would all love there to be,
not all of us,

2671
01:52:24,731 --> 01:52:27,400
but most sane people don't want racism
to exist.

2672
01:52:27,820 --> 01:52:30,910
But should we not let people meet?
Should we be bugging people?

2673
01:52:30,911 --> 01:52:34,090
Should we force people to do something
they don't want to do?

2674
01:52:34,091 --> 01:52:34,811
I mean,
I just don't,

2675
01:52:34,811 --> 01:52:37,330
I just fundamentally do not believe in
that.

2676
01:52:37,480 --> 01:52:40,330
I don't want people to be racist.
I don't want people to be homophobic or

2677
01:52:40,331 --> 01:52:43,480
transphobic.
But the idea that the government can use

2678
01:52:43,481 --> 01:52:47,180
its authority to make people do all of
these things I just think is absolutely

2679
01:52:47,181 --> 01:52:47,990
crazy.

2680
01:52:47,990 --> 01:52:51,650
So whether they decided to intentionally
inflame this or not by finding people

2681
01:52:51,651 --> 01:52:53,420
that,
that weren't going to do it.

2682
01:52:54,380 --> 01:52:56,690
If you really,
if you're listening to this right now

2683
01:52:56,691 --> 01:52:59,420
and you're getting married,
you know you're getting gay,

2684
01:52:59,421 --> 01:53:00,780
married,
um,

2685
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:03,040
or untraditional,
he married as they call it,

2686
01:53:03,041 --> 01:53:05,680
you're doing that and you live in
Alabama and there's only one baker there

2687
01:53:05,681 --> 01:53:08,230
and he doesn't want to bake a cake.
It sucks.

2688
01:53:08,231 --> 01:53:10,930
It does suck.
But what you might want to do is what I

2689
01:53:10,931 --> 01:53:13,450
said about an hour ago,
which is maybe leave that town like

2690
01:53:13,451 --> 01:53:15,160
maybe take your skills,
whatever,

2691
01:53:15,161 --> 01:53:18,880
whatever worth you bring to a community
and move to a bigger town where there

2692
01:53:18,881 --> 01:53:21,250
probably is some of their do it or order
a cake online.

2693
01:53:21,370 --> 01:53:24,490
I mean the technological part that you
just mentioned that you can now tweet

2694
01:53:24,491 --> 01:53:26,590
about stuff and go,
don't go,

2695
01:53:26,591 --> 01:53:29,110
don't go.
Like we have power as people.

2696
01:53:29,260 --> 01:53:32,590
And the idea that we outsource all the
decision making to the government is

2697
01:53:32,591 --> 01:53:34,270
extremely dangerous.
I mean,

2698
01:53:34,271 --> 01:53:37,000
every,
every horror in human history is a

2699
01:53:37,001 --> 01:53:39,640
government doing things basically,
you know,

2700
01:53:39,641 --> 01:53:41,410
as long as governments have pretty much
existed,

2701
01:53:41,710 --> 01:53:45,070
it's not bands of Nice individual people
that disagree on some stuff murdering.

2702
01:53:45,180 --> 01:53:46,320
Yeah.
I mean,

2703
01:53:46,321 --> 01:53:49,350
I understand your position and I'm with
you to a certain extent.

2704
01:53:49,370 --> 01:53:51,420
Uh,
I wish there was a clean answer.

2705
01:53:51,510 --> 01:53:53,520
There's no clean answer,
but freedom is not clean.

2706
01:53:53,521 --> 01:53:54,720
That's the,
yeah.

2707
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:57,120
Yeah.
I mean even the freedom to be a piece of

2708
01:53:57,121 --> 01:53:58,270
shit.
Yeah.

2709
01:53:58,330 --> 01:54:01,690
And to be racist and to be sexist or
homophobic or whatever it is.

2710
01:54:01,700 --> 01:54:02,980
And you know,
we,

2711
01:54:03,550 --> 01:54:05,710
we have to define what that is and the
first place,

2712
01:54:05,711 --> 01:54:08,020
right?
Like who by whose definition is

2713
01:54:08,021 --> 01:54:10,510
something homophobic or by WHO's deaf?
And I mean,

2714
01:54:10,511 --> 01:54:12,700
is it homophobic or is it religious
freedom?

2715
01:54:12,730 --> 01:54:13,520
Like if,
if,

2716
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:16,420
you know,
if someone is deeply religious and their

2717
01:54:16,421 --> 01:54:19,180
religion discriminates against gay
people,

2718
01:54:19,690 --> 01:54:22,200
are they discriminatory or are they
religious?

2719
01:54:22,201 --> 01:54:24,460
You have to give me an example of what
they were actually doing.

2720
01:54:25,110 --> 01:54:27,540
Like you're allowed to hate gay people.
You,

2721
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:29,650
you are,
I hope that you do not,

2722
01:54:30,700 --> 01:54:33,610
and I actually think this is somewhere
where the conservatives have moved.

2723
01:54:33,611 --> 01:54:37,180
I really do think they have moved.
There's virtually no mainstream

2724
01:54:37,181 --> 01:54:39,580
conservative that's screaming about gay
marriage anymore.

2725
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:42,350
Even Mike Huckabee who sort of
irrelevant or like that,

2726
01:54:42,351 --> 01:54:44,080
that the Christian conservative side of
that,

2727
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:47,410
they pretty much have ted Cruz,
what does he say about gay marriage

2728
01:54:47,411 --> 01:54:49,930
anymore?
But that's again why rand Paul should

2729
01:54:49,931 --> 01:54:53,200
have led or the the real,
the true conservatives that believe in

2730
01:54:53,201 --> 01:54:55,300
limited government should have led the
charge on this.

2731
01:54:55,660 --> 01:54:59,410
So this is where the progressive's did
do something right years ago because

2732
01:54:59,411 --> 01:55:03,220
they were fighting for real equality
because real equality means you should

2733
01:55:03,221 --> 01:55:06,670
be able to marry whoever you want.
They weren't going for extra rights for

2734
01:55:06,671 --> 01:55:08,770
anyone.
Now they're going for extra rights

2735
01:55:08,771 --> 01:55:13,050
because we all have equality.
Doesn't mean we all have equal

2736
01:55:13,051 --> 01:55:15,360
everything,
but we have to have equality under the

2737
01:55:15,361 --> 01:55:17,340
law.
That's all the government can provide

2738
01:55:17,341 --> 01:55:19,080
you.
And then once you have that,

2739
01:55:19,081 --> 01:55:20,880
some of us are going to be born into
more money,

2740
01:55:20,910 --> 01:55:22,230
right?
Like your kids are going to have more

2741
01:55:22,231 --> 01:55:26,320
money then you did right.
Fact should they be punished for that?

2742
01:55:26,750 --> 01:55:28,310
A lot of people would say yes,
he was a lot of,

2743
01:55:28,360 --> 01:55:29,660
we do think that,
yeah.

2744
01:55:29,750 --> 01:55:30,171
I mean,
look,

2745
01:55:30,171 --> 01:55:34,040
I don't believe you should be able to
give your kids money when you die.

2746
01:55:34,550 --> 01:55:35,170
We'll do

2747
01:55:35,170 --> 01:55:36,610
the estate tax.
I'm mostly,

2748
01:55:36,611 --> 01:55:39,850
I hope that I'll be able to make enough
money in my life that that will be a

2749
01:55:39,851 --> 01:55:41,860
problem,
but it will be a problem for you for

2750
01:55:41,861 --> 01:55:43,950
sure.
Short of you go bust on everything

2751
01:55:43,951 --> 01:55:45,270
you're doing,
which I'm assuming is not going to

2752
01:55:45,271 --> 01:55:48,030
happen.
Do you think at the end of your life

2753
01:55:48,330 --> 01:55:51,060
that you've paid taxes your whole life,
you've paid payroll taxes because you

2754
01:55:51,061 --> 01:55:53,400
have employees,
you've done all of these things,

2755
01:55:53,401 --> 01:55:54,630
you've done everything right as a
citizen,

2756
01:55:54,631 --> 01:55:57,180
do you think at the end of the day the
government should be able to come in and

2757
01:55:57,181 --> 01:55:59,910
take something like 55% of your money at
that?

2758
01:56:00,290 --> 01:56:01,340
No.
That's creepy.

2759
01:56:01,341 --> 01:56:03,260
It's creepy that they're able to do
that.

2760
01:56:03,261 --> 01:56:06,950
To take money from taxed money.
Yeah,

2761
01:56:06,951 --> 01:56:09,050
so the money's already been taxed for
your whole life.

2762
01:56:09,110 --> 01:56:10,820
Yeah.
You earned that money and then they're

2763
01:56:10,821 --> 01:56:14,180
going to tax it on top of that,
but that's a mainstream democratic

2764
01:56:14,870 --> 01:56:17,000
talking points.
It's one of those things where they're

2765
01:56:17,001 --> 01:56:21,230
dealing with the redistribution of
wealth that that conversation,

2766
01:56:21,231 --> 01:56:24,830
the redistribution of wealth is super
slippery because like who's going to

2767
01:56:24,831 --> 01:56:29,210
redistribute it and to who and like when
do you decide that someone has too much

2768
01:56:29,211 --> 01:56:31,310
money or what?
You know,

2769
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:35,030
what's the standard,
what's the metric and what what,

2770
01:56:35,450 --> 01:56:39,320
what occupation are we going to,
we are we only going to go after the

2771
01:56:39,321 --> 01:56:41,630
bankers and we're going to go after
artists as well.

2772
01:56:41,720 --> 01:56:44,660
Like what if someone's a successful
artist and we're going to take all their

2773
01:56:44,661 --> 01:56:47,510
money are we're going to remove
incentive for success?

2774
01:56:47,511 --> 01:56:51,230
There's a certain line that you're going
to cross where you shouldn't be more

2775
01:56:51,231 --> 01:56:54,530
successful because they're going to tax
you harder if we're going to keep people

2776
01:56:54,531 --> 01:56:55,364
in some,
some,

2777
01:56:55,430 --> 01:57:00,260
some sort of an artificially constructed
glass ceiling to avoid being taxed like

2778
01:57:00,280 --> 01:57:01,430
it's a real weird,

2779
01:57:01,610 --> 01:57:03,350
I hate to tell you,
but everything you just said there is

2780
01:57:03,351 --> 01:57:06,180
completely against what Democrats
basically are for.

2781
01:57:06,181 --> 01:57:09,530
They are for the estate tax.
I mean the bold why,

2782
01:57:09,531 --> 01:57:12,860
what's the argument?
The argument is you died and now in the

2783
01:57:13,340 --> 01:57:14,540
greater good,
which is,

2784
01:57:14,780 --> 01:57:16,820
which is a phrase that sounds really
good but it's,

2785
01:57:16,821 --> 01:57:18,950
but it's your,
your face pretty much summed it up.

2786
01:57:19,160 --> 01:57:21,050
It never leads to good.
Well we can,

2787
01:57:21,051 --> 01:57:25,580
okay let's just give more money to this
thing that wastes money on everything at

2788
01:57:25,581 --> 01:57:28,970
that has no accountability.
This giant money churning monster.

2789
01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:30,470
Yeah.
That's the real issue,

2790
01:57:30,471 --> 01:57:31,850
right,
is that this thing doesn't have

2791
01:57:31,851 --> 01:57:34,460
accountability and that it does waste a
shitload of money.

2792
01:57:34,650 --> 01:57:37,310
Think about this.
If the government was slim and trim and

2793
01:57:37,370 --> 01:57:40,250
effective and you know,
we were all tax right and it was

2794
01:57:40,251 --> 01:57:42,590
transparent and effective and
functional,

2795
01:57:42,790 --> 01:57:44,330
there would be no reason to be a
libertarian.

2796
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:46,730
I'd be sitting here going,
I'm for government.

2797
01:57:46,790 --> 01:57:49,400
You know what I mean?
Like if it really operated in a slim

2798
01:57:49,401 --> 01:57:50,690
way,
but what the government doesn't do

2799
01:57:50,691 --> 01:57:53,780
anything good.
Name one problem you could possibly have

2800
01:57:53,781 --> 01:57:55,340
in your life,
Joe Rogan that you'd be like,

2801
01:57:55,420 --> 01:57:57,230
get me,
get the government to solve this.

2802
01:57:57,770 --> 01:57:59,150
Did they do the post office?
Well,

2803
01:57:59,180 --> 01:57:59,641
no.
What?

2804
01:57:59,641 --> 01:58:01,340
Like what do they do?
Well they do.

2805
01:58:01,341 --> 01:58:03,290
The Post Office is pretty good actually,
but guess what?

2806
01:58:03,291 --> 01:58:05,600
If the post office closes tomorrow,
it will be all right.

2807
01:58:05,720 --> 01:58:08,180
You'd still get mail,
Amazon pick note.

2808
01:58:08,181 --> 01:58:10,540
When Amazon was,
say us through ups,

2809
01:58:10,541 --> 01:58:12,290
it would cost a lot more.
He wouldn't though.

2810
01:58:12,291 --> 01:58:17,270
Competition would start kicking in and
between ups and Fedex and Amazon and

2811
01:58:17,271 --> 01:58:18,350
drones and Blah,
blah,

2812
01:58:18,351 --> 01:58:20,600
blah and DHL,
they'd all start.

2813
01:58:20,630 --> 01:58:24,110
I would probably drop prices because
right now we've just got this artificial

2814
01:58:24,111 --> 01:58:27,410
thing that sits there that then allows
them to price according to that,

2815
01:58:27,411 --> 01:58:30,830
but if you drop that,
why is the government in that business

2816
01:58:30,831 --> 01:58:32,240
anymore?
I have three chickens.

2817
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:35,720
I've really done the Joe Rogan lifestyle
here over the last couple of years,

2818
01:58:35,721 --> 01:58:37,220
but I have three chickens right now.
We had,

2819
01:58:37,550 --> 01:58:40,190
I'm going to give you a good ups story.
We ordered them.

2820
01:58:40,191 --> 01:58:42,550
They were born August on a Monday

2821
01:58:42,610 --> 01:58:45,490
in a cleveland.
They hatch that day.

2822
01:58:45,491 --> 01:58:48,310
They threw him in a box with a little
hole you sps,

2823
01:58:48,490 --> 01:58:50,560
and they showed up at my door in La on a
Tuesday.

2824
01:58:50,830 --> 01:58:52,530
The USBS has been doing that for about a
hundred.

2825
01:58:52,531 --> 01:58:53,950
The only way you can do it,
by the way,

2826
01:58:53,951 --> 01:58:57,780
you can't order chickens through any
other methods suggests usbs.

2827
01:58:57,820 --> 01:58:59,680
Yeah,
so actually I was given the usbs credit

2828
01:58:59,681 --> 01:59:01,240
there cause my chickens all arrived
live.

2829
01:59:01,270 --> 01:59:02,640
Yeah,
they send the checks.

2830
01:59:02,690 --> 01:59:03,523
Yeah,
you're,

2831
01:59:03,580 --> 01:59:07,240
you're buying these live checks.
That's the way you get them to the US

2832
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:10,710
Postal Service.
I'm pretty sure though that if the u sps

2833
01:59:10,780 --> 01:59:12,160
stopped,
it didn't exist anywhere.

2834
01:59:12,161 --> 01:59:15,040
You'd still get chickens delivered and
Amazon and could probably do it even

2835
01:59:15,041 --> 01:59:16,810
more effectively.
That's my point.

2836
01:59:16,811 --> 01:59:19,240
It's like I'm not saying these things
have to be eliminated tomorrow.

2837
01:59:19,241 --> 01:59:21,040
I'm not even really calling for them to
be eliminated.

2838
01:59:21,041 --> 01:59:24,120
But just generally what problem would
you,

2839
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:25,870
everything you were building here right
now,

2840
01:59:25,871 --> 01:59:26,650
right?

2841
01:59:26,650 --> 01:59:29,290
Do you want the government to tell you
how to do all these things and all the

2842
01:59:29,291 --> 01:59:33,190
regulations that you got to have your
electric thing this far from this and

2843
01:59:33,191 --> 01:59:36,490
like all have regulations like that for
construction are important though.

2844
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:38,770
You don't have to make sure that people
don't do stupid shit,

2845
01:59:38,860 --> 01:59:43,090
but a power lines near a water line.
There's a lot of,

2846
01:59:43,450 --> 01:59:45,370
but I would put most of that on the
builder's though.

2847
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:47,510
They want to build things that are good.
Now I get hauled.

2848
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:49,240
That's not true.
Listen,

2849
01:59:49,241 --> 01:59:51,730
people don't know.
People are going to build all the time

2850
01:59:51,731 --> 01:59:54,500
like you have to have regulations when
it comes to construction methods where

2851
01:59:54,501 --> 01:59:56,230
people are going to get fucked,
they cut regulate.

2852
01:59:56,260 --> 01:59:58,450
They cut corners when there aren't
regulations anyway.

2853
01:59:58,690 --> 02:00:01,240
They do.
They would cut a lot more if there

2854
02:00:01,241 --> 02:00:03,640
weren't regulated.
I'm not totally third world countries

2855
02:00:03,641 --> 02:00:04,900
and look at construction methods.

2856
02:00:04,900 --> 02:00:08,020
They're fucking dangerous.
That's why schools collapse on kids and

2857
02:00:08,021 --> 02:00:10,120
foreign countries sometimes like,
well,

2858
02:00:10,121 --> 02:00:12,130
I'm not complete.
I'm not telling you that I'm against all

2859
02:00:12,131 --> 02:00:13,450
regulation period.
That's where,

2860
02:00:13,650 --> 02:00:16,360
but that's where I said intellectually,
I like that argument because you could

2861
02:00:16,361 --> 02:00:18,400
make us,
I think you can make a very sound

2862
02:00:18,401 --> 02:00:22,660
argument that competition would force
people to do better work.

2863
02:00:22,661 --> 02:00:26,020
Like if you're a plumber,
you have a vested interest in doing the

2864
02:00:26,021 --> 02:00:29,800
best plumbing job you can so that people
were rate you on Yelp so that you will

2865
02:00:29,801 --> 02:00:31,900
get more work.
You don't have a vested interest in

2866
02:00:31,901 --> 02:00:33,250
cutting corners.
Now you might write,

2867
02:00:33,251 --> 02:00:36,550
you're going to push it as much as you
can to save as much time and energy and

2868
02:00:36,551 --> 02:00:39,220
money as you can,
but once you go over that edge,

2869
02:00:39,221 --> 02:00:40,540
yeah,
you don't want to be known as the guy

2870
02:00:40,541 --> 02:00:42,790
that the,
you tighten something too much that you

2871
02:00:42,791 --> 02:00:44,930
flooded the house or when you're
building a house.

2872
02:00:44,950 --> 02:00:48,310
Thinking logically though,
when when people fuck things up and

2873
02:00:48,311 --> 02:00:51,190
short things and do things terrible,
they're not thinking logically,

2874
02:00:51,220 --> 02:00:53,830
but I don't think it's the government.
I don't think it's the government that

2875
02:00:53,831 --> 02:00:56,290
they're like,
the government gave me this regulation

2876
02:00:56,291 --> 02:00:57,940
so that's why I'm going to do it.
Right.

2877
02:00:58,180 --> 02:00:58,860
Well,
you know,

2878
02:00:58,860 --> 02:01:02,440
didn't have any regulations.
That would be no incentive whatsoever to

2879
02:01:02,450 --> 02:01:02,861
do it.
Right.

2880
02:01:02,861 --> 02:01:04,450
No.
There would be an incentive knew there

2881
02:01:04,451 --> 02:01:07,330
were no inspectors,
no one was going to check their stuff

2882
02:01:07,331 --> 02:01:09,070
and make sure that their stuff was up to
code.

2883
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:09,791
Listen,
man,

2884
02:01:09,791 --> 02:01:12,400
I was in no instruction my whole life.
My Dad was an architect.

2885
02:01:12,470 --> 02:01:14,260
I've been in construction since I was a
little kid.

2886
02:01:14,680 --> 02:01:17,380
You fucking need regulations.
These guys,

2887
02:01:17,560 --> 02:01:20,020
a lot of people that are in construction
there,

2888
02:01:20,021 --> 02:01:24,100
they'll do whatever the fuck they can to
make money and it's not good for the

2889
02:01:24,101 --> 02:01:26,920
people that have the house because they
might have that house for five,

2890
02:01:26,921 --> 02:01:29,290
10 years before that problem manifests
itself.

2891
02:01:29,680 --> 02:01:34,680
The people who are establishing these
codes are licensed builders or people

2892
02:01:34,691 --> 02:01:38,140
that have been involved in construction
for a long fucking time and they know

2893
02:01:38,141 --> 02:01:40,010
what's safe and what's safe.
That's why

2894
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:43,130
those codes exist.
It exists to protect the consumers.

2895
02:01:43,250 --> 02:01:46,970
You can't just protect the consumers
through the marketplace because so I'm

2896
02:01:46,971 --> 02:01:50,750
not calling all the time for these
problems to become a real issue and

2897
02:01:50,870 --> 02:01:53,840
these problems could potentially damage
everybody in the neighborhood.

2898
02:01:53,841 --> 02:01:57,610
It's not just going to affect the person
on this one lot like of a fire starts,

2899
02:01:57,611 --> 02:02:00,800
it burns all the houses in the
neighborhood or if a flood happens and

2900
02:02:00,801 --> 02:02:02,410
it floods everyone downhill,
it's,

2901
02:02:02,420 --> 02:02:05,210
it's a real problem.
Like you have to be real careful with

2902
02:02:05,211 --> 02:02:07,570
construction.
I get it and you know,

2903
02:02:07,940 --> 02:02:10,970
my dad wasn't in construction so I'm not
privy to like all of that,

2904
02:02:11,450 --> 02:02:14,690
the little stuff.
But I genuinely believe that as a

2905
02:02:14,691 --> 02:02:18,710
general level people have a vested
interest in,

2906
02:02:18,890 --> 02:02:23,570
especially now because of phones and
apps and yelp and all of them doing good

2907
02:02:23,660 --> 02:02:25,800
work because that's how you will get
more work.

2908
02:02:25,910 --> 02:02:28,220
You are,
you're never going to remove the people

2909
02:02:28,221 --> 02:02:31,520
who will do shotty,
shitty malicious shit,

2910
02:02:31,550 --> 02:02:34,070
but you can keep them at bay with
regulation.

2911
02:02:34,160 --> 02:02:36,020
I think this is where I'd say you can
hate it.

2912
02:02:36,021 --> 02:02:37,520
Some regulation,
educated,

2913
02:02:37,521 --> 02:02:40,160
regulate regulation,
people who actually understand what's

2914
02:02:40,161 --> 02:02:42,890
going on and you know,
make sure that someone doesn't do

2915
02:02:42,891 --> 02:02:46,540
something stupid with a power line or
someone do something stupid with the,

2916
02:02:46,541 --> 02:02:48,860
the way they constructed main beams
where the,

2917
02:02:48,861 --> 02:02:52,340
they're just subject to collapse.
I that's important because most people

2918
02:02:52,341 --> 02:02:53,840
buying a house,
I don't know what the fuck they're

2919
02:02:53,841 --> 02:02:55,940
looking for.
Most people getting a house built,

2920
02:02:56,240 --> 02:03:00,380
they have no idea about construction
methods and they need someone to inspect

2921
02:03:00,381 --> 02:03:02,180
things and make sure that it's up to
code.

2922
02:03:02,390 --> 02:03:04,550
That's why code exists.
It's very important.

2923
02:03:04,580 --> 02:03:05,351
Yeah,
I saw,

2924
02:03:05,351 --> 02:03:07,430
I'm not,
I'm not totally with you on that.

2925
02:03:07,431 --> 02:03:09,620
Like I do think Mo,
I think most of it,

2926
02:03:09,621 --> 02:03:14,060
probably 90% of it would be who has the
most vested interest to build a good

2927
02:03:14,061 --> 02:03:14,390
house.

2928
02:03:14,390 --> 02:03:16,280
It's the builder because he wants more
work.

2929
02:03:16,281 --> 02:03:18,270
He doesn't want the house to collapse
because then he'll be added.

2930
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:19,333
I'm telling you,
man,

2931
02:03:19,390 --> 02:03:20,450
I got you.
I got you though.

2932
02:03:20,570 --> 02:03:22,540
I get it.
Then he's got not just cops.

2933
02:03:22,890 --> 02:03:27,530
There's a specific thing.
It's a dangerous thing too,

2934
02:03:27,531 --> 02:03:29,630
because it's where you sleep.
It's where your kids sleep.

2935
02:03:29,640 --> 02:03:30,473
It's,
it's,

2936
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:32,330
you know,
you just,

2937
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:37,600
I think there's a lot of idealistic
notions about deregulation and I think

2938
02:03:37,911 --> 02:03:41,180
there's,
there's some consumer protection has to

2939
02:03:41,181 --> 02:03:46,181
be put in place because people don't
have the time to spend all this time

2940
02:03:46,581 --> 02:03:50,090
researching construction methods and
making sure everything's done correctly

2941
02:03:50,091 --> 02:03:53,630
and be there and make sure that the
joists are a certain width and they have

2942
02:03:53,631 --> 02:03:56,510
a certain amount of support.
Like all that stuff has to be done by

2943
02:03:56,511 --> 02:04:00,380
people who understand code,
assuming that the government regulators

2944
02:04:00,381 --> 02:04:03,860
understand code correctly and aren't
just on the take or just try,

2945
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:05,290
you know,
you know,

2946
02:04:05,300 --> 02:04:07,970
just basically just taking money and
signing off on things.

2947
02:04:07,970 --> 02:04:09,950
I mean,
house Spec things,

2948
02:04:09,951 --> 02:04:11,930
man.
If you ever had a construction project

2949
02:04:11,931 --> 02:04:12,350
done.
Yeah,

2950
02:04:12,350 --> 02:04:15,650
well I got my house last year and we had
to go through all the inspections and

2951
02:04:15,651 --> 02:04:18,050
had several guys come back and we didn't
build it.

2952
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:21,440
Now there's a big difference between
insurance inspector and a code

2953
02:04:21,441 --> 02:04:23,690
inspector.
Code inspectors are very different when

2954
02:04:23,691 --> 02:04:27,110
you're having a house built.
And I've had construction projects where

2955
02:04:27,111 --> 02:04:29,130
I had to explain to people and go
through it with,

2956
02:04:29,131 --> 02:04:31,950
with builders.
They're there making sure that the house

2957
02:04:31,951 --> 02:04:34,880
is in fucking fall on you,
that the power lines,

2958
02:04:34,910 --> 02:04:35,491
you know,
are,

2959
02:04:35,491 --> 02:04:38,100
are done correctly,
that all the electricity done

2960
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:39,000
correctly,
the pipes,

2961
02:04:39,270 --> 02:04:40,170
uh,
late incorrectly,

2962
02:04:40,260 --> 02:04:42,180
your septic system,
where your sewage system has done

2963
02:04:42,181 --> 02:04:45,150
correctly.
Do you think that could be privatized

2964
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:46,550
then?
See,

2965
02:04:46,551 --> 02:04:47,384
cause again,
I'm not,

2966
02:04:47,400 --> 02:04:49,360
I'm just,
I just think it's an regulations.

2967
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:52,080
How would it,
how would you could have the company no

2968
02:04:52,081 --> 02:04:53,010
incentive.
Well No,

2969
02:04:53,011 --> 02:04:57,600
you could have companies that would,
that their job would be to make sure to

2970
02:04:57,601 --> 02:04:58,434
inspect.
Yeah.

2971
02:04:58,500 --> 02:05:01,830
And you wouldn't have,
they wouldn't have the thread of law to,

2972
02:05:01,860 --> 02:05:03,990
to enforce these things.
Like if someone is,

2973
02:05:04,620 --> 02:05:06,720
if someone is building something and
they're not up to code,

2974
02:05:06,721 --> 02:05:08,730
they lose their license and they can't
build.

2975
02:05:08,970 --> 02:05:11,790
If you privatized it,
what's the incentive for them to follow

2976
02:05:11,791 --> 02:05:13,230
the guidelines?
Yeah.

2977
02:05:13,231 --> 02:05:15,510
So this is,
this is where I'm not telling you that

2978
02:05:15,511 --> 02:05:17,910
I'm calling for all this.
I just think intellectually it's just an

2979
02:05:17,911 --> 02:05:20,790
interesting space to,
to argue something.

2980
02:05:20,790 --> 02:05:25,200
Cause I think that there's more the more
that you can give to people to freely do

2981
02:05:25,410 --> 02:05:27,960
what they think is right.
I think generally they will.

2982
02:05:27,961 --> 02:05:29,040
Like again,
I get it.

2983
02:05:29,041 --> 02:05:32,670
There's going to be some real shitty
construction people out there you don't

2984
02:05:32,671 --> 02:05:33,870
think you should have on to talk about
this.

2985
02:05:33,871 --> 02:05:36,630
And I think people have looped you in
before is you're on Brooke from uh,

2986
02:05:36,870 --> 02:05:38,130
from mine ran institute.
He's,

2987
02:05:38,160 --> 02:05:40,640
cause he's no only sweet began with no,
no.

2988
02:05:40,650 --> 02:05:42,150
All right.
So I'll be happy if they have,

2989
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:43,170
I'm pay attention.
Okay.

2990
02:05:43,171 --> 02:05:44,130
So I'll,
I'll be happy to do it.

2991
02:05:44,131 --> 02:05:47,220
He's a really interesting guy whose
mother was thinking a little bit on

2992
02:05:47,221 --> 02:05:49,110
this.
Those iron brand people are fucking

2993
02:05:49,111 --> 02:05:50,490
harsh.
They like ideas,

2994
02:05:50,491 --> 02:05:51,324
man.
Those are,

2995
02:05:53,320 --> 02:05:55,470
they're not the most fun people on the
there on the planet.

2996
02:05:55,500 --> 02:05:57,570
But I generally,
I generally liked them because they just

2997
02:05:57,571 --> 02:05:58,950
want their kind of live and let live.

2998
02:05:59,050 --> 02:06:01,560
That's really it.
Like that's like the crux of it pretty

2999
02:06:01,561 --> 02:06:03,600
much.
Is that really the crux of it or I mean,

3000
02:06:03,740 --> 02:06:05,610
yeah,
people think that there's like sort of a

3001
02:06:05,611 --> 02:06:09,090
cruelty aspect to it.
I ran philosophy,

3002
02:06:09,120 --> 02:06:12,210
well they believe in,
in rational self interest,

3003
02:06:12,211 --> 02:06:15,390
which if you say self,
it makes people think you're evil.

3004
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:17,940
But,
but we all basically operate in rational

3005
02:06:17,941 --> 02:06:19,650
self interest all the time.
Right.

3006
02:06:19,651 --> 02:06:21,760
But espousing it with us,
the thing,

3007
02:06:21,761 --> 02:06:23,970
it's like proclaiming it is a thing that
people go,

3008
02:06:23,971 --> 02:06:24,900
oh,
you're,

3009
02:06:25,170 --> 02:06:27,370
you're,
you're essentially setting up the idea

3010
02:06:27,371 --> 02:06:29,610
of the Gordon Gekko idea.
Greed is good.

3011
02:06:30,170 --> 02:06:33,480
I kind of buy into that idea.
Do you buy into greed is good.

3012
02:06:33,510 --> 02:06:35,940
Yeah.
Basically not greed to destroy the

3013
02:06:35,941 --> 02:06:38,010
world.
But if you do you joe,

3014
02:06:38,040 --> 02:06:41,400
do what is good for you.
And by extension greed,

3015
02:06:41,730 --> 02:06:43,210
well that's [inaudible] ambition.
Well,

3016
02:06:43,640 --> 02:06:44,431
all right.
Exactly.

3017
02:06:44,431 --> 02:06:45,420
That's my point,
right?

3018
02:06:45,730 --> 02:06:47,340
Where it gets conflated,
isn't it?

3019
02:06:47,550 --> 02:06:48,383
Right.
So with,

3020
02:06:48,390 --> 02:06:51,600
so without wiggling it to the definition
of greed versus ambition,

3021
02:06:51,601 --> 02:06:53,660
it's like you do what's good for you,
but,

3022
02:06:53,661 --> 02:06:55,170
but,
but it doesn't mean you're just running

3023
02:06:55,171 --> 02:06:59,160
this like rampaging program to destroy
the world in the name of Joe Rogan.

3024
02:06:59,161 --> 02:07:02,820
You're doing what's good for you because
you actually like your audience and you

3025
02:07:02,821 --> 02:07:05,610
want them to learn you.
You want to have money so that your

3026
02:07:05,611 --> 02:07:08,210
family can live in a house that you can
afford,

3027
02:07:08,220 --> 02:07:10,650
that you can send your kids to good
schools and all of those things.

3028
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:14,880
That's all rational self interest.
If at the same time you were running a

3029
02:07:14,881 --> 02:07:18,300
nuclear power plant and you are Mr.
Burns and you were dumping in the river,

3030
02:07:18,420 --> 02:07:20,940
well no,
that's actually no longer rational self

3031
02:07:20,941 --> 02:07:23,670
interest because now you're polluting
the very environment that you live in.

3032
02:07:23,910 --> 02:07:26,220
So rational,
I mean the key takes care of that.

3033
02:07:26,221 --> 02:07:27,960
Who regulates that?
So they,

3034
02:07:28,240 --> 02:07:31,410
so generally comes in.
So those guys,

3035
02:07:31,411 --> 02:07:33,810
I don't want to speak for a little,
gets you in trouble if you,

3036
02:07:33,811 --> 02:07:34,970
in your opinion,
if you're,

3037
02:07:35,110 --> 02:07:36,640
you're this deregulation

3038
02:07:36,640 --> 02:07:39,370
guy who goes after you when you dump
shit into the river.

3039
02:07:39,420 --> 02:07:41,220
So I'm not saying there should be no
regulation.

3040
02:07:41,221 --> 02:07:44,610
I just was saying that I like this.
Generally I like this line of thinking

3041
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:47,040
there has to be some regulation.
I agree you can't.

3042
02:07:47,250 --> 02:07:48,250
But what I would say is,
you know,

3043
02:07:48,251 --> 02:07:50,820
that's where the regulation comes in and
the environment.

3044
02:07:51,260 --> 02:07:51,721
Yeah.
That,

3045
02:07:51,721 --> 02:07:54,960
I would say there has to be some,
but I've had some interesting people on

3046
02:07:54,961 --> 02:07:57,450
conservatives who are dealing with doing
uh,

3047
02:07:57,780 --> 02:08:00,660
environmental stuff from a conservative
perspective that there's ways to make

3048
02:08:00,661 --> 02:08:05,280
money actually in green stuff,
in green products and in Al Gore.

3049
02:08:05,330 --> 02:08:05,831
Yeah.
Well,

3050
02:08:05,831 --> 02:08:06,121
look,
yeah,

3051
02:08:06,121 --> 02:08:07,950
he's been,
I don't know that he's creating anything

3052
02:08:07,951 --> 02:08:11,010
other than movies,
but he's making me make a lot of money,

3053
02:08:11,040 --> 02:08:13,050
a lot of money in green corporations.
Right.

3054
02:08:13,230 --> 02:08:15,360
So that,
but that's him doing it privately,

3055
02:08:15,410 --> 02:08:16,243
right?
Yeah.

3056
02:08:16,250 --> 02:08:17,960
Yeah.
But what is like,

3057
02:08:17,961 --> 02:08:21,820
what's the solution if someone pollutes,
if you're not going to have regulation,

3058
02:08:21,821 --> 02:08:24,280
what is the solution?
If someone does something that's

3059
02:08:24,281 --> 02:08:25,114
illegal?

3060
02:08:25,750 --> 02:08:26,860
Well,
if you're not going to have regulation,

3061
02:08:26,861 --> 02:08:28,510
he wouldn't be illegal.
But your question is,

3062
02:08:28,690 --> 02:08:30,350
well,
it's illegal dump,

3063
02:08:30,380 --> 02:08:32,540
dump things into the river,
right?

3064
02:08:32,970 --> 02:08:34,050
I mean,
it's just illegal.

3065
02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:36,390
That's not a matter of regulation.
I mean,

3066
02:08:36,450 --> 02:08:39,780
polluting,
we'll willful poisoning of rivers.

3067
02:08:39,870 --> 02:08:43,770
I'm sure he's actually terrorism.
It would be a bunch of like,

3068
02:08:44,130 --> 02:08:46,350
so what those guys would argue is what I
said before,

3069
02:08:46,351 --> 02:08:49,320
which is that ultimately,
especially now because of technology,

3070
02:08:49,321 --> 02:08:51,540
like in the old days,
so like every time someone cuts

3071
02:08:51,541 --> 02:08:53,190
regulation,
I've heard Bill Maher say this a lot,

3072
02:08:53,191 --> 02:08:55,460
they're going to start a polluting the
river immediately.

3073
02:08:55,670 --> 02:08:57,860
That implies that these businessmen,
whatever their,

3074
02:08:57,861 --> 02:08:58,670
you know,
where they're,

3075
02:08:58,670 --> 02:09:00,380
whatever they are,
whatever industry that they're in,

3076
02:09:00,620 --> 02:09:02,060
that they're immediately going to be
like,

3077
02:09:02,061 --> 02:09:04,340
Huh,
the regulations gone start polluting the

3078
02:09:04,341 --> 02:09:06,560
water.
We live in a time now where everyone's

3079
02:09:06,561 --> 02:09:09,710
walking around with an iphone where
maybe 50 years ago you could've got away

3080
02:09:09,711 --> 02:09:11,600
with a lot of bad shit,
right?

3081
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:15,380
Coal miners that we're breathing,
all kinds of horrible shit that nobody

3082
02:09:15,381 --> 02:09:18,890
was ever going to find out about where
now everybody is walking around with

3083
02:09:18,891 --> 02:09:20,870
snapchat and instagram and blah,
blah blah.

3084
02:09:21,140 --> 02:09:25,400
So a lot of this stuff would be exposed
more so that all of the things that

3085
02:09:25,401 --> 02:09:27,470
we've been talking about for the last
couple of hours about,

3086
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:31,910
about people getting involved,
a lot of the things I think would start

3087
02:09:31,940 --> 02:09:33,650
self regulating.
But again,

3088
02:09:33,651 --> 02:09:36,350
and then I won't say it again.
I'm not for just deregulating

3089
02:09:36,590 --> 02:09:38,600
everything.
I just think there's probably better

3090
02:09:38,601 --> 02:09:42,590
ways to do it than just having the
government come in and say,

3091
02:09:42,591 --> 02:09:46,310
this is what you gotta do and now figure
it out because the government isn't that

3092
02:09:46,311 --> 02:09:47,600
good at most things.

3093
02:09:48,190 --> 02:09:49,840
Yeah,
I know what you're saying there.

3094
02:09:49,900 --> 02:09:50,500
But,
uh,

3095
02:09:50,500 --> 02:09:54,160
I do think that obviously there has to
be laws in place,

3096
02:09:54,390 --> 02:09:56,860
uh,
specifically laws in place that protect

3097
02:09:56,861 --> 02:10:00,250
people from someone doing something and
it's going to damage all the other

3098
02:10:00,251 --> 02:10:01,120
people in the community.

3099
02:10:01,290 --> 02:10:01,831
Yeah.
Well,

3100
02:10:01,831 --> 02:10:02,341
by the way,
that,

3101
02:10:02,341 --> 02:10:05,190
so you can do that from the government
supposed to protect your life and your

3102
02:10:05,191 --> 02:10:05,701
property.
I mean,

3103
02:10:05,701 --> 02:10:08,160
that's a very simple libertarian thing,
you know what I mean?

3104
02:10:08,161 --> 02:10:09,960
Like,
so that there's a good argument there

3105
02:10:09,961 --> 02:10:13,120
for why you could have some level of
regulation.

3106
02:10:13,121 --> 02:10:13,220
Right.

3107
02:10:13,220 --> 02:10:17,060
But I don't think it's just like
specifically in terms of like someone

3108
02:10:17,360 --> 02:10:20,100
polluting rivers.
I don't think it's good enough to snap

3109
02:10:20,101 --> 02:10:22,430
chat about it.
I think people should be locked up and

3110
02:10:22,431 --> 02:10:26,180
go to jail if they find out that
someone's dumping toxic waste into the

3111
02:10:26,181 --> 02:10:31,181
river because it's too expensive to
process it and get it removed and put in

3112
02:10:31,281 --> 02:10:32,780
some place where it's,
it's,

3113
02:10:32,930 --> 02:10:33,920
you know,
safe.

3114
02:10:34,500 --> 02:10:35,450
That's a crime.

3115
02:10:35,540 --> 02:10:37,640
Yeah.
Well I'm all for finding those people

3116
02:10:37,641 --> 02:10:39,470
and having the company's fire them and
all those things.

3117
02:10:39,471 --> 02:10:43,010
As far as putting them in jail,
I don't know that I'm glad come up.

3118
02:10:43,070 --> 02:10:44,270
Yeah.
I don't know that I'm getting them off

3119
02:10:44,271 --> 02:10:45,800
the streets.
Take the money,

3120
02:10:45,801 --> 02:10:49,730
give it to Bernie's kids.
I'm not a fan of putting more people in

3121
02:10:49,731 --> 02:10:50,890
jail generally.
But

3122
02:10:50,990 --> 02:10:51,471
yeah.
No,

3123
02:10:51,471 --> 02:10:52,640
I'm not either.
You know,

3124
02:10:52,641 --> 02:10:54,770
I think that's one of the more
interesting things that happened in this

3125
02:10:54,771 --> 02:10:59,600
administration is when Kim Kardashian
got that lady incredible generated or

3126
02:10:59,601 --> 02:11:03,210
whatever,
he did got a release to get her sentence

3127
02:11:03,211 --> 02:11:04,890
commuted.
That's Kinda crazy.

3128
02:11:04,891 --> 02:11:08,940
Like she showed up and she presented
this case about some woman who's,

3129
02:11:08,941 --> 02:11:10,680
uh,
been in jail for,

3130
02:11:10,710 --> 02:11:14,010
she's essentially jail for life for
nonviolent drug offense.

3131
02:11:14,011 --> 02:11:14,844
Right?
Yeah.

3132
02:11:15,010 --> 02:11:18,740
And how many other people are like her
for non violent drug?

3133
02:11:18,741 --> 02:11:21,320
A pen this long,
doing something with your own body.

3134
02:11:21,450 --> 02:11:24,660
Yeah,
well that's where we're full and total

3135
02:11:24,661 --> 02:11:28,290
agreement.
I just think that this idea that the

3136
02:11:28,380 --> 02:11:33,240
pharmaceutical companies can sell drugs,
but people can't sell drugs that they

3137
02:11:33,241 --> 02:11:35,550
can,
they're responsible for the UN

3138
02:11:36,900 --> 02:11:40,020
untenable.
The unimaginable number of people that

3139
02:11:40,021 --> 02:11:43,230
have died from opiate withdrawal or
opiate,

3140
02:11:43,231 --> 02:11:44,370
um,
overdoses.

3141
02:11:44,371 --> 02:11:45,600
Fentanyl.
I mean,

3142
02:11:45,601 --> 02:11:48,390
fentanyl.
Just last year we lost Tom Petty.

3143
02:11:48,391 --> 02:11:50,460
We lost prince.
Um,

3144
02:11:50,970 --> 02:11:52,560
couple of other people too.
I can't remember.

3145
02:11:52,561 --> 02:11:54,780
There's some other famous people that
died from fentanyl.

3146
02:11:55,070 --> 02:11:56,280
Um,
uh,

3147
02:11:56,290 --> 02:11:57,420
Patton,
Oswald's wife,

3148
02:11:57,660 --> 02:11:59,700
she was another fentanyl.
This,

3149
02:11:59,701 --> 02:12:01,440
it's like,
it's a horrible,

3150
02:12:01,530 --> 02:12:06,090
horrible,
horrible drug and no one's clamoring for

3151
02:12:06,091 --> 02:12:07,080
these people to go to jail

3152
02:12:07,250 --> 02:12:10,100
scratching drugs all day long.
You go watch cable news all day long.

3153
02:12:10,101 --> 02:12:14,240
What are they selling all day long?
Prescription drugs with a zillion side

3154
02:12:14,241 --> 02:12:18,380
effects that are seemingly far worse,
including thoughts of suicide and

3155
02:12:18,381 --> 02:12:19,131
depression and blah,
blah,

3156
02:12:19,131 --> 02:12:20,570
blah.
Then the original thing they're trying

3157
02:12:20,571 --> 02:12:23,600
to treat.
So look when specifically opiates.

3158
02:12:23,880 --> 02:12:24,310
Yeah,

3159
02:12:24,310 --> 02:12:25,990
it's of the day,
the real deadly ones.

3160
02:12:25,991 --> 02:12:28,510
And then you think about how many people
that are in jail right now for

3161
02:12:28,511 --> 02:12:30,670
marijuana,
how many people that are in jail for

3162
02:12:30,671 --> 02:12:33,130
cocaine,
how many in jail people are in jail for

3163
02:12:33,790 --> 02:12:35,960
psychedelics?
MTMA mean it's,

3164
02:12:36,160 --> 02:12:39,280
there's no comparison in terms of the
amount of damage done per capita.

3165
02:12:39,420 --> 02:12:40,430
I,
I completely agree.

3166
02:12:40,431 --> 02:12:43,700
Look when when the thing happened with
Roseanne and then she blamed ambient or

3167
02:12:43,701 --> 02:12:46,730
she at least said she was on Ambien,
you know the Ambien,

3168
02:12:46,760 --> 02:12:48,140
the parent company,
whatever it was,

3169
02:12:48,141 --> 02:12:51,140
they tweeted out something like there
are a lot of side effects but it doesn't

3170
02:12:51,141 --> 02:12:54,770
make you racist.
But knowing how Glib and ridiculous that

3171
02:12:54,771 --> 02:12:55,311
was.
Yes.

3172
02:12:55,311 --> 02:12:58,130
No one is saying that ambien makes you
racist,

3173
02:12:58,460 --> 02:13:01,100
but ambien does have a litany of,
I don't know,

3174
02:13:01,101 --> 02:13:03,330
50 side effects it,
you know,

3175
02:13:03,400 --> 02:13:06,010
sleepwalking saying crazy things,
eating,

3176
02:13:06,110 --> 02:13:08,540
you know,
literally just being unable to control

3177
02:13:08,541 --> 02:13:11,630
what you're doing while you're on ambien
being in this Zombie like state.

3178
02:13:11,780 --> 02:13:15,920
So is it possible that even though she
has also said that she didn't realize

3179
02:13:15,921 --> 02:13:18,680
that Valerie Jarret was black,
which I actually kind of do believe.

3180
02:13:19,300 --> 02:13:21,140
I don't know.
I sent it to me.

3181
02:13:21,170 --> 02:13:22,110
Yeah.
I don't know her.

3182
02:13:22,310 --> 02:13:23,270
I know,
I know.

3183
02:13:23,271 --> 02:13:24,380
I mean,
I know her a little bit.

3184
02:13:24,381 --> 02:13:24,760
So

3185
02:13:24,760 --> 02:13:26,660
she didn't think she was black.
I believe her.

3186
02:13:26,710 --> 02:13:30,970
I believe her 100% but look,
she said dumb shit in the,

3187
02:13:31,440 --> 02:13:32,160
the Susan Rice

3188
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:35,880
thing was much more egregious to one
where she said that a Susan right rice

3189
02:13:35,881 --> 02:13:38,160
was a man.
Eight balls.

3190
02:13:38,220 --> 02:13:39,380
Yeah,
no.

3191
02:13:39,420 --> 02:13:41,070
Yeah.
So I'm not defending what rue events at

3192
02:13:41,071 --> 02:13:44,610
all I'm saying is that Ambien,
the maker sends out this Glib tweet,

3193
02:13:44,611 --> 02:13:46,650
like we don't make people racists,
but guess what?

3194
02:13:46,651 --> 02:13:50,250
You have people doing all kinds of crazy
shit that they can,

3195
02:13:50,440 --> 02:13:53,640
having conversations,
people have driven their cars and the

3196
02:13:53,641 --> 02:13:56,160
wrong side of the highway.
People who have done all kinds of crazy

3197
02:13:56,161 --> 02:13:56,820
shit on there.
Right.

3198
02:13:56,820 --> 02:14:01,470
So is it possible that made her impaired
enough to have a stupid thought and then

3199
02:14:01,620 --> 02:14:04,020
100% yeah,
it's 100% there's definitely side

3200
02:14:04,021 --> 02:14:04,740
effects.
The,

3201
02:14:04,740 --> 02:14:07,800
whether or not they're responsible for
those side effects is where it gets into

3202
02:14:08,100 --> 02:14:10,710
the realm of personal responsibility.
Like,

3203
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:14,220
if you take ambien and you do something,
are you responsible for it?

3204
02:14:14,610 --> 02:14:15,443
No.

3205
02:14:15,450 --> 02:14:16,500
Yes.
What are we going to say?

3206
02:14:16,710 --> 02:14:19,440
If you drink and you go commit a violent
crime,

3207
02:14:19,441 --> 02:14:20,880
are you responsible for,
we all agree,

3208
02:14:20,881 --> 02:14:22,830
yes.
So it gets real strange.

3209
02:14:22,860 --> 02:14:24,840
You know,
it gets real strange.

3210
02:14:25,110 --> 02:14:27,240
I mean that,
that's one of the weird things when it

3211
02:14:27,241 --> 02:14:30,450
comes to gender and responsibility
because there's been so many issues of

3212
02:14:30,540 --> 02:14:32,190
men and women,
particular,

3213
02:14:32,430 --> 02:14:34,770
it's almost always men and women.
You never hear about these from gay

3214
02:14:34,771 --> 02:14:37,200
couples,
but men and women or I haven't heard

3215
02:14:37,201 --> 02:14:38,520
about it,
at least men and women,

3216
02:14:38,560 --> 02:14:40,800
uh,
getting drunk and having sex and then

3217
02:14:40,801 --> 02:14:45,801
the man gets accused of sexual assault.
And this has gotten so weird that a guy,

3218
02:14:46,260 --> 02:14:50,250
um,
preemptively guy and a girl got had sex

3219
02:14:50,610 --> 02:14:51,950
and the guy,
um,

3220
02:14:52,200 --> 02:14:56,400
called the police and wanted her charge
was sexual assault because he was drunk.

3221
02:14:56,610 --> 02:14:59,220
And he did it as a preemptive measure
because he was worried that she was

3222
02:14:59,221 --> 02:15:00,060
going to come after him.

3223
02:15:00,450 --> 02:15:03,510
And so the university took action
against the girl and I'm like,

3224
02:15:03,511 --> 02:15:06,030
Jesus Christ.
And we play in little stupid games.

3225
02:15:06,031 --> 02:15:08,790
And pretending that girls rape guys when
they're drunk or that it's really

3226
02:15:08,791 --> 02:15:11,610
devastating for the guy.
Like what the fuck are we doing?

3227
02:15:11,950 --> 02:15:15,640
We are going to criminalize everything.
We're going to criminalize every,

3228
02:15:15,700 --> 02:15:18,240
I think of all of the stupid things
you've done in your life,

3229
02:15:18,360 --> 02:15:21,490
whether on drugs or not or whether we
when you were in college or not

3230
02:15:21,510 --> 02:15:23,820
involved.
Now add social media to that.

3231
02:15:23,821 --> 02:15:27,100
Add the the amount of pictures that
people send to each other and everything

3232
02:15:27,101 --> 02:15:29,760
else.
If we don't stop this attic control

3233
02:15:30,030 --> 02:15:32,580
monster,
we are all just going to destroy each

3234
02:15:32,581 --> 02:15:34,620
other.
But there's a gray area because we know

3235
02:15:34,621 --> 02:15:37,230
that some people do take advantage of
people that are drunk.

3236
02:15:37,231 --> 02:15:40,110
Like if someone was,
if someone was like porn drunk drinks

3237
02:15:40,111 --> 02:15:42,450
down someone's face and they were sober
and they were doing it with the

3238
02:15:42,451 --> 02:15:45,960
intention of raping them once they were
intoxicated and they couldn't consent

3239
02:15:45,961 --> 02:15:47,430
anymore,
that's one thing.

3240
02:15:47,640 --> 02:15:50,480
But if two people are getting together
and drinking and then having sex and

3241
02:15:50,481 --> 02:15:52,740
then the woman has regret in the morning
when she sobers up.

3242
02:15:52,741 --> 02:15:56,370
So she decides that it was rape because
she and he were both drunk.

3243
02:15:56,550 --> 02:15:59,430
That's preposterous.
But we don't have this ability to

3244
02:15:59,610 --> 02:16:04,110
rationally process each and individual.
Each individual case.

3245
02:16:04,220 --> 02:16:06,240
By the way,
here's something that trump did that was

3246
02:16:06,241 --> 02:16:08,550
really good.
He got rid of those ridiculous title

3247
02:16:08,551 --> 02:16:12,600
nine laws that Obama in stated where
they were basically having these clown

3248
02:16:12,601 --> 02:16:16,950
courts in colleges that you could go to
them and instead of having due process,

3249
02:16:16,951 --> 02:16:20,570
which is perhaps the most important
piece of,

3250
02:16:20,580 --> 02:16:24,510
of a functioning western free society
where you are innocent until proven

3251
02:16:24,511 --> 02:16:27,150
guilty.
They were suspending male students just

3252
02:16:27,151 --> 02:16:30,220
by accusations and then it was leaking.
I had Laura Kipnis

3253
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:33,370
on who's a professor that they were,
she was fighting against title nine so

3254
02:16:33,371 --> 02:16:35,260
then they brought up title nine charges
against her.

3255
02:16:35,261 --> 02:16:36,550
I mean there's,
and there's many,

3256
02:16:36,551 --> 02:16:39,250
many other stories on this.
That's something that Obama brought in

3257
02:16:39,251 --> 02:16:41,170
that trump actually got rid of that
evil.

3258
02:16:41,171 --> 02:16:43,720
What's her name?
[inaudible] Betsy devoss got rid of.

3259
02:16:43,810 --> 02:16:47,920
So it's like we've,
we've just gotten to the point where

3260
02:16:47,921 --> 02:16:52,150
we've politicized everything.
We've politicized our own capacity to be

3261
02:16:52,151 --> 02:16:56,770
free and make decisions for ourselves.
If you get drunk and are fooling around

3262
02:16:56,771 --> 02:16:58,840
with somebody,
some of that's on you,

3263
02:16:59,110 --> 02:17:00,260
you might regret it.
And the next one,

3264
02:17:00,261 --> 02:17:00,880
we,
every,

3265
02:17:00,880 --> 02:17:05,290
every single one of us listening to this
has had sex with someone or done drugs

3266
02:17:05,291 --> 02:17:07,450
with someone or something.
Woke up the next morning and be like,

3267
02:17:07,720 --> 02:17:09,460
fuck,
I shouldn't have done that Jamie.

3268
02:17:10,780 --> 02:17:12,370
Jamie's clean.
Um,

3269
02:17:12,430 --> 02:17:16,090
except here's my thing.
I was thinking about driving.

3270
02:17:16,150 --> 02:17:17,530
If you drive in,
you're drunk.

3271
02:17:17,531 --> 02:17:19,990
No one says you're exonerated because
you're drunk,

3272
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:21,851
right?
No,

3273
02:17:21,851 --> 02:17:24,400
man,
you are drunk and fucked up and you did

3274
02:17:24,401 --> 02:17:26,620
something drunk.
You're responsible for your actions.

3275
02:17:26,800 --> 02:17:30,160
But if you have sex drunk,
all of a sudden for some strange reason,

3276
02:17:30,161 --> 02:17:32,410
you're not responsible for your actions.
That's preposterous.

3277
02:17:32,750 --> 02:17:34,900
It doesn't,
they don't match up.

3278
02:17:34,930 --> 02:17:36,160
It's not,
it doesn't make any sense.

3279
02:17:36,190 --> 02:17:36,791
Yeah.
But again,

3280
02:17:36,791 --> 02:17:39,550
this is where the,
the identity politics of all this ruins

3281
02:17:39,551 --> 02:17:41,410
everything.
Because you're not saying that anyone

3282
02:17:41,411 --> 02:17:42,970
that gets drunk,
you're saying if a girl really,

3283
02:17:42,971 --> 02:17:45,410
although that one example that you gave
is true.

3284
02:17:45,920 --> 02:17:48,070
That's like a curriculum.
It's a complete throw away.

3285
02:17:48,071 --> 02:17:50,200
Ridiculous.
Shows you how fucking stupid the

3286
02:17:50,201 --> 02:17:54,070
university is that they let that fly.
They should've smacked him.

3287
02:17:54,400 --> 02:17:56,380
Send it back to class.
Smack him in the face.

3288
02:17:56,410 --> 02:17:57,390
Yeah,
Sun right back to class.

3289
02:17:57,400 --> 02:17:59,290
Congratulations Buddy.
He's got laid.

3290
02:17:59,350 --> 02:18:00,460
Yeah,
good for you.

3291
02:18:00,461 --> 02:18:02,590
You were drunk and the girl took
advantage of your penis.

3292
02:18:02,890 --> 02:18:04,210
Did you orgasm?
You did.

3293
02:18:04,211 --> 02:18:06,520
Shut the fuck up.
Get out of here.

3294
02:18:07,300 --> 02:18:08,670
What are you doing?
It's,

3295
02:18:09,070 --> 02:18:10,330
it's ridiculous.
Across the board.

3296
02:18:10,331 --> 02:18:13,480
It's a far more ridiculous though.
When a guy is accusing,

3297
02:18:13,481 --> 02:18:17,380
and let's just be honest about this,
it's far more ridiculous when a guy is

3298
02:18:17,381 --> 02:18:19,660
accusing a girl of rape in those
circumstances,

3299
02:18:19,930 --> 02:18:22,930
and I don't want to hear all your
progressive nonsense screaming and

3300
02:18:22,931 --> 02:18:24,280
yelling and no,
it's not.

3301
02:18:24,281 --> 02:18:26,320
We're all equal.
Fuck you.

3302
02:18:26,770 --> 02:18:29,590
It's not the same of a guy does that to
a girl.

3303
02:18:29,591 --> 02:18:33,490
If a guy purposely gets a girl drunk and
does it because he knows that she

3304
02:18:33,491 --> 02:18:36,200
wouldn't consent any other way.
And then gets her department.

3305
02:18:36,250 --> 02:18:37,240
She's like,
oh,

3306
02:18:37,241 --> 02:18:39,250
and she's barely conscious and fucks
her.

3307
02:18:39,370 --> 02:18:39,970
In my opinion.

3308
02:18:39,970 --> 02:18:40,803
That's rape.
Yeah,

3309
02:18:40,900 --> 02:18:44,110
and my opinion that that person,
but if a couple gets together and they

3310
02:18:44,111 --> 02:18:45,520
have a few drinks,
they're laughing,

3311
02:18:45,521 --> 02:18:47,710
they're flirting,
and they make out and then they go back

3312
02:18:47,711 --> 02:18:49,630
to her place or his place and they have
sex.

3313
02:18:49,930 --> 02:18:51,610
It's not rape.
We know it's not rape.

3314
02:18:51,770 --> 02:18:53,290
All right,
so let's split the difference on that

3315
02:18:53,291 --> 02:18:54,041
one.
So now it's a,

3316
02:18:54,041 --> 02:18:55,870
it's a sorority party.
In College,

3317
02:18:55,900 --> 02:18:59,710
the girls decide they're going to drop
Ruthie's in a couple of the guys' things

3318
02:19:00,100 --> 02:19:01,830
late at night.
Girls are just,

3319
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:02,501
you know,
let's just,

3320
02:19:02,501 --> 02:19:03,820
I don't know what the girls look like.
Right?

3321
02:19:04,360 --> 02:19:05,470
Okay.
So girls look good,

3322
02:19:05,500 --> 02:19:06,251
right?
So,

3323
02:19:06,251 --> 02:19:09,100
right.
So a bunch of hot chicks now there,

3324
02:19:09,220 --> 02:19:10,480
they drug these guys.
I mean,

3325
02:19:10,481 --> 02:19:13,570
I'm sure this has happened.
This is definitely never heard of it.

3326
02:19:13,630 --> 02:19:15,730
If you're sure it's happened.
It's got to have happened.

3327
02:19:16,020 --> 02:19:18,490
They roofie to guy.
I'm sure a guy has been,

3328
02:19:18,520 --> 02:19:20,670
I'm pretty sure I got roof by a girl in
college.

3329
02:19:21,560 --> 02:19:23,920
Now I'm married to a dude.
So who knows what's going on.

3330
02:19:23,950 --> 02:19:25,030
Me,
she fucked her brain up.

3331
02:19:25,360 --> 02:19:26,590
She,
she seriously,

3332
02:19:26,591 --> 02:19:28,010
it was some high level

3333
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:29,300
Ruthie Shit.
I was like,

3334
02:19:29,900 --> 02:19:31,790
we went all night and then I was like,
you know what,

3335
02:19:31,910 --> 02:19:35,630
I've had just about enough of this,
enough of this gal stuff.

3336
02:19:35,631 --> 02:19:38,690
You really got roofie by girl.
I was roofied once in college.

3337
02:19:38,691 --> 02:19:40,570
I like just like a keg party.
What'd you like?

3338
02:19:40,580 --> 02:19:41,840
Who did it?
I don't know who did it.

3339
02:19:41,841 --> 02:19:45,410
I don't have much of a recollection of
it other than I remember I had like half

3340
02:19:45,411 --> 02:19:47,690
a beer.
I could not really think.

3341
02:19:47,691 --> 02:19:50,360
And I remember I couldn't stand.
Did you realize something was wrong and

3342
02:19:50,361 --> 02:19:52,790
try to get it out of there.
I knew something was wrong,

3343
02:19:52,791 --> 02:19:56,630
but your mind doesn't operate correctly.
And I remember I was Kinda,

3344
02:19:56,631 --> 02:19:59,210
I remember my friends were there,
but we were all like stoners at the

3345
02:19:59,211 --> 02:20:00,170
time.
So I don't even know that.

3346
02:20:00,171 --> 02:20:03,570
I was like thinking clearly like
something you don't realize fully.

3347
02:20:03,570 --> 02:20:05,220
You don't,
you know something's not right,

3348
02:20:05,221 --> 02:20:07,410
but you're like,
at least what happened to me was I just

3349
02:20:07,411 --> 02:20:09,120
couldn't like put all the pieces
together.

3350
02:20:09,220 --> 02:20:11,660
You get tested,
do you find out what it was now?

3351
02:20:11,880 --> 02:20:15,120
I mean I remember,
I remember at one point just sitting on

3352
02:20:15,121 --> 02:20:17,850
a couch in the corner.
I remember a very bright lamp light

3353
02:20:17,851 --> 02:20:20,040
above me out.
I have no recollection of how I got home

3354
02:20:20,041 --> 02:20:23,190
or like any of that.
But it also makes 20 years roofing all

3355
02:20:23,191 --> 02:20:24,530
like why,
why wouldn't you think it's,

3356
02:20:24,710 --> 02:20:26,780
how do you say it,
hip and all something.

3357
02:20:27,270 --> 02:20:29,820
How do you say that?
Let's just say Ruthie,

3358
02:20:29,820 --> 02:20:31,350
Ruthie.
What makes you think it was that and not

3359
02:20:31,351 --> 02:20:32,670
like,
oh I don't know.

3360
02:20:32,671 --> 02:20:33,840
Maybe,
well cause I didn't trip.

3361
02:20:33,841 --> 02:20:34,890
I mean I wasn't,
you know,

3362
02:20:34,950 --> 02:20:36,360
I've tripped,
I've done that stuff.

3363
02:20:36,361 --> 02:20:39,000
What does that other stuff that people
give or ge or something like that?

3364
02:20:39,060 --> 02:20:41,200
Yeah.
Like I don't think I was in like a k

3365
02:20:41,201 --> 02:20:44,200
hole or I've never done that.
I don't think I was in that kind of

3366
02:20:44,201 --> 02:20:45,100
state.
I was just in this,

3367
02:20:45,101 --> 02:20:48,610
like my body kind of couldn't move,
you know,

3368
02:20:48,620 --> 02:20:52,490
little aura kind of stuff.
Bright light and like I kind of couldn't

3369
02:20:52,491 --> 02:20:54,260
think straight that that's the way I
would describe it.

3370
02:20:54,261 --> 02:20:54,921
But I've,
I mean,

3371
02:20:54,921 --> 02:20:57,440
I've done mushrooms,
I've done most things that are out here.

3372
02:20:57,500 --> 02:20:59,900
I wasn't hallucinating in any way,
so,

3373
02:20:59,901 --> 02:21:01,610
but,
but just playing that went out for a

3374
02:21:01,611 --> 02:21:04,040
second.
If a girl did that to a guy,

3375
02:21:04,670 --> 02:21:08,000
managed to get him hard,
fuck them.

3376
02:21:08,140 --> 02:21:10,110
Right.
I think you think it's the same thing.

3377
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:14,070
You walk it off,
walk it off policy.

3378
02:21:14,340 --> 02:21:15,930
Those are my four words.
Suck it up,

3379
02:21:15,960 --> 02:21:16,930
suck it up,
get off.

3380
02:21:18,150 --> 02:21:19,310
You got you got laid.

3381
02:21:19,950 --> 02:21:21,090
Yeah.
It's not good.

3382
02:21:21,150 --> 02:21:24,030
It's definitely not good for anybody to
take advantage of someone's body and

3383
02:21:24,060 --> 02:21:28,560
particularly give them a drug and where
they can't Dev no control and then raped

3384
02:21:28,561 --> 02:21:29,070
them.
Yeah.

3385
02:21:29,070 --> 02:21:31,470
It's the same thing.
If a girl does it to a guy,

3386
02:21:31,471 --> 02:21:32,810
it is the same thing.
She roof,

3387
02:21:32,811 --> 02:21:35,460
he's the guy and has sex.
And especially what if the guy has a

3388
02:21:35,461 --> 02:21:38,310
girlfriend and he doesn't want to have
sex with her or you know,

3389
02:21:38,311 --> 02:21:41,160
fill in the blank.
He's not attracted to her or he's gay

3390
02:21:41,460 --> 02:21:43,770
and you do that to him and he's repulsed
by it.

3391
02:21:43,800 --> 02:21:44,610
Yeah,
it's right.

3392
02:21:44,610 --> 02:21:45,443
Yeah.
Yeah.

3393
02:21:45,750 --> 02:21:48,870
But you know,
now we're in the realm of Bill Cosby,

3394
02:21:48,900 --> 02:21:51,450
right?
The bill cosby situation is fucking

3395
02:21:51,451 --> 02:21:52,330
break,
right?

3396
02:21:52,331 --> 02:21:53,280
Yeah.
100%.

3397
02:21:53,310 --> 02:21:55,440
No doubt.
It's a big difference between that and a

3398
02:21:55,441 --> 02:21:57,660
couple that gets together and has a
couple of drinks.

3399
02:21:57,750 --> 02:22:00,190
Have you heard it from a gay
perspective,

3400
02:22:00,191 --> 02:22:03,790
like two gay guys getting drunk and
having sex and one of the guy's accusing

3401
02:22:03,791 --> 02:22:05,530
the other one of sexual assault because
he was drunk?

3402
02:22:05,590 --> 02:22:06,790
Well,
I've definitely heard of the first part,

3403
02:22:06,970 --> 02:22:08,600
two gay guys getting drunk and
hepatitis.

3404
02:22:08,750 --> 02:22:10,840
I've heard any of the events that's
happened a lot.

3405
02:22:11,130 --> 02:22:13,230
Uh,
the rape one,

3406
02:22:13,330 --> 02:22:18,330
I haven't heard it that I've heard so
many stories about a woman in this one

3407
02:22:18,341 --> 02:22:21,460
story about a man claiming that he was
sexually assaulted because they were

3408
02:22:21,461 --> 02:22:23,310
drunk.
I've never heard it about two gay guys.

3409
02:22:23,510 --> 02:22:26,690
I actually do know one of a guy,
um,

3410
02:22:26,940 --> 02:22:29,580
that was given something,
that gift that was given something.

3411
02:22:29,590 --> 02:22:33,180
Yeah,
but not two guys not willingly got drunk

3412
02:22:33,181 --> 02:22:34,130
and then,
no,

3413
02:22:34,410 --> 02:22:37,410
not that.
I definitely have people been given.

3414
02:22:37,411 --> 02:22:40,770
Sure can attack 100% that that's
probably just a guy thing.

3415
02:22:40,800 --> 02:22:42,420
Fucking dark thing.
Man,

3416
02:22:42,450 --> 02:22:45,990
that's a dark thing that people are
willing to do that that caused me,

3417
02:22:45,991 --> 02:22:48,010
thinks,
shook me to my fucking core.

3418
02:22:48,390 --> 02:22:51,180
The idea that this guy who was America's
sweetheart,

3419
02:22:51,210 --> 02:22:54,660
America's dad was possibly the greatest
series,

3420
02:22:54,690 --> 02:22:58,590
not the Russians or the greatest,
but one of the worst serial rapists of

3421
02:22:58,591 --> 02:23:00,300
all time,
if not the worst.

3422
02:23:00,330 --> 02:23:01,890
Did we we,
the first time I came on,

3423
02:23:01,891 --> 02:23:04,510
we talked about cosby.
He's the reason I got into comedy at

3424
02:23:04,520 --> 02:23:08,130
four years old,
I think it was 1981 or 1982 maybe I was

3425
02:23:08,131 --> 02:23:11,040
five.
I saw a bill cosby himself on HBO.

3426
02:23:11,040 --> 02:23:15,390
I remember sitting in the,
in my family room buckled over and

3427
02:23:15,391 --> 02:23:16,920
laughing to the point,
you know,

3428
02:23:16,950 --> 02:23:20,640
when you just your whole body,
you cannot pain in my stomach.

3429
02:23:20,880 --> 02:23:22,950
And I remember thinking,
I want to be funny.

3430
02:23:23,310 --> 02:23:28,310
And now my comedy hero is basically the
biggest serial rapist of all time.

3431
02:23:28,740 --> 02:23:29,760
What the fuck,
man?

3432
02:23:30,120 --> 02:23:33,000
I used to have cosby records hanging up
in my house even to three years ago,

3433
02:23:33,001 --> 02:23:34,950
and eventually as the story started
leaking out,

3434
02:23:34,980 --> 02:23:38,100
I have one of his great records and I,
at first I was like,

3435
02:23:38,140 --> 02:23:40,590
I'm just going to leave it up.
Like it doesn't change my feelings about

3436
02:23:40,591 --> 02:23:42,780
him as a comic.
And then I remember people would be

3437
02:23:42,781 --> 02:23:43,740
coming into my house,
oh,

3438
02:23:43,741 --> 02:23:46,590
you got gotta be over there.
You should do you just take it and then

3439
02:23:46,591 --> 02:23:49,560
put bars over it.
That's what I should do.

3440
02:23:49,710 --> 02:23:52,120
I bet you that leave it up there,
but bars over it.

3441
02:23:52,140 --> 02:23:54,690
Yeah.
I might do this just so fucked.

3442
02:23:54,960 --> 02:23:57,120
Like how could he,
how could he be that guy?

3443
02:23:57,121 --> 02:24:00,870
How could he be the guy who is so funny
and everybody loves them and also be the

3444
02:24:00,871 --> 02:24:03,000
guy that that drugs people and rape
some.

3445
02:24:03,001 --> 02:24:04,740
It's like what a dark,
dark,

3446
02:24:04,770 --> 02:24:06,030
dark secret.
I mean,

3447
02:24:06,031 --> 02:24:08,700
I think Jordan would have a lot to say
on this stuff that we,

3448
02:24:08,701 --> 02:24:12,870
these inconsistencies that we live with
that often drive us and that,

3449
02:24:12,990 --> 02:24:15,000
you know,
why did we find out that that,

3450
02:24:15,330 --> 02:24:17,310
you know,
these people preaching about morals or

3451
02:24:17,340 --> 02:24:20,730
all the time are the same people that
are doing all this weird shit or that

3452
02:24:20,731 --> 02:24:23,370
we've all done things that we're not
proud of or whatever it is.

3453
02:24:23,371 --> 02:24:25,020
And it's like that's part of being a
human.

3454
02:24:25,050 --> 02:24:25,910
It's just part.
Yeah.

3455
02:24:26,110 --> 02:24:29,190
Yeah.
You're talking about the evil,

3456
02:24:29,390 --> 02:24:30,790
I mean,
someone who's doing this into his

3457
02:24:30,810 --> 02:24:33,510
fucking sixties he was doing this,
but he gets,

3458
02:24:33,511 --> 02:24:34,440
it becomes an addiction.

3459
02:24:34,440 --> 02:24:36,720
Like anything else like you or your
mind,

3460
02:24:36,721 --> 02:24:39,990
I'm sure,
I'm sure people do studies on this about

3461
02:24:40,020 --> 02:24:43,080
what happens to the actual brain
chemistry when you're doing these things

3462
02:24:43,100 --> 02:24:45,840
that I would guess it has something to
do with the dopamine levels that are

3463
02:24:45,841 --> 02:24:49,290
released at the same time when,
when you know somebody's snorting coke

3464
02:24:49,291 --> 02:24:51,300
and doing whatever they're doing,
you know,

3465
02:24:51,330 --> 02:24:53,370
whatever it is,
I don't know what it is,

3466
02:24:53,371 --> 02:24:56,010
but it's just so stunning to me.
Yeah.

3467
02:24:56,310 --> 02:24:56,910
Yeah.
I mean,

3468
02:24:56,910 --> 02:24:58,620
there's a,
and again this is,

3469
02:24:58,750 --> 02:25:02,070
it goes back to laws or there's a need
to protect people,

3470
02:25:02,100 --> 02:25:04,170
but there's also a need to go,
hey,

3471
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:08,550
college boy who got drunk and had sex
with a girl who was also drunk.

3472
02:25:08,551 --> 02:25:10,830
He didn't get raped.
Fuck off.

3473
02:25:10,880 --> 02:25:13,470
It's,
it's really disrespectful to people that

3474
02:25:13,471 --> 02:25:15,280
actually had been raped,
you know?

3475
02:25:15,300 --> 02:25:17,400
And I get,
it's kind of funny that he's turning the

3476
02:25:17,401 --> 02:25:21,180
tables and he's doing it to her.
I think there was a story,

3477
02:25:21,181 --> 02:25:24,370
part of the store was something about,
she had done it to one of his friends.

3478
02:25:24,370 --> 02:25:27,280
She had said that to one of his friends.
So he's preemptively doing it because he

3479
02:25:27,281 --> 02:25:28,870
thought that she was gonna come after
him now.

3480
02:25:29,030 --> 02:25:30,590
Well,
part of it is that it's gross,

3481
02:25:30,591 --> 02:25:31,990
that it's all public,
right?

3482
02:25:31,991 --> 02:25:35,210
Like everything has become so public.
And I think that that's part of the

3483
02:25:35,211 --> 02:25:38,180
problem all the time.
Like who banged who in college?

3484
02:25:38,181 --> 02:25:42,760
The idea that that now is like this
thing that gets written about and people

3485
02:25:42,761 --> 02:25:44,360
get interviewed on all of these things.
Like,

3486
02:25:44,680 --> 02:25:47,560
again,
all of that is kind of dangerous and

3487
02:25:47,561 --> 02:25:51,520
that's why I try all the time.
And I think what you usually do is you

3488
02:25:51,521 --> 02:25:56,020
usually talk about ideas not people
cause it's the underlying philosophical

3489
02:25:56,021 --> 02:25:58,630
ideas that matter.
Not the specifics of this kid.

3490
02:25:58,631 --> 02:26:01,720
I mean you didn't pull up the picture of
the kid and mentioned the girl's name

3491
02:26:01,721 --> 02:26:04,420
and hers are twitter and all that,
but that it's the underlying

3492
02:26:04,421 --> 02:26:06,610
philosophical issues of why are we doing
this?

3493
02:26:06,611 --> 02:26:09,580
Why are we exposing everybody?
Why are we attacking and destroying

3494
02:26:09,581 --> 02:26:10,960
everybody and all of that.
That,

3495
02:26:10,961 --> 02:26:15,180
that's much more interesting to me.
Then just the specifics of the people or

3496
02:26:15,450 --> 02:26:18,060
you know,
all the people that I'm so sick of all

3497
02:26:18,061 --> 02:26:20,120
these blue check writers and buzzfeed
people.

3498
02:26:20,130 --> 02:26:22,930
Like I never called them out
specifically like that guy.

3499
02:26:22,931 --> 02:26:25,470
I hate that guy.
Cause like he,

3500
02:26:25,500 --> 02:26:28,790
that guys,
nobody during the business of writing.

3501
02:26:28,791 --> 02:26:28,910
Right.

3502
02:26:28,910 --> 02:26:30,260
You know,
I think a lot of it is,

3503
02:26:30,680 --> 02:26:33,320
I mean we can decide that these people
are enemy,

3504
02:26:33,321 --> 02:26:37,460
but like we're in some ways photos on
the battlefield.

3505
02:26:38,090 --> 02:26:39,010
You know,
I just,

3506
02:26:39,050 --> 02:26:41,360
in a very perverse way,
in a very perverse way,

3507
02:26:41,380 --> 02:26:45,420
and I don't,
I just think it's just like their job is

3508
02:26:45,421 --> 02:26:49,080
to write about things and when we're
involved in a story,

3509
02:26:49,530 --> 02:26:53,460
they find an angle and they go after it.
Just like I do with jokes.

3510
02:26:53,550 --> 02:26:56,420
Like when I,
if I crack a joke about somebody else,

3511
02:26:56,510 --> 02:27:00,090
I do a bit about someone else hate them.
Like I had this whole bit about,

3512
02:27:00,091 --> 02:27:02,460
um,
Bruce Jenner and the Kardashians.

3513
02:27:02,461 --> 02:27:05,490
What led bruce to become a woman because
I hated him.

3514
02:27:05,690 --> 02:27:07,350
It's cause it was,
I thought it was funny.

3515
02:27:07,370 --> 02:27:09,060
Yeah.
I thought is there's an angle there.

3516
02:27:09,090 --> 02:27:11,760
It's a story.
It's a big thing that's on people's

3517
02:27:11,761 --> 02:27:12,330
minds.

3518
02:27:12,330 --> 02:27:17,280
And so it became a target for me the
same way it is when a lot of these folks

3519
02:27:17,281 --> 02:27:21,390
write articles and you know,
a lot of them are in their twenties and

3520
02:27:21,391 --> 02:27:24,000
you know,
they're idealistic or they're young and

3521
02:27:24,001 --> 02:27:27,870
evolving their thoughts and maybe they
wouldn't write that article five years

3522
02:27:27,900 --> 02:27:29,940
from now or 10 years from now,
whatever.

3523
02:27:29,941 --> 02:27:32,510
And we don't think we have to take that
into consideration as well.

3524
02:27:32,530 --> 02:27:36,390
These people are embarking on a career
in journalism and you know,

3525
02:27:36,450 --> 02:27:40,830
for a lot of them shitting on Jordan
Peterson gets them social brownie

3526
02:27:40,831 --> 02:27:41,664
points.
Yeah.

3527
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:42,833
Yeah.

3528
02:27:43,110 --> 02:27:44,850
You know what,
you want to shift topics for sure.

3529
02:27:44,851 --> 02:27:46,560
Can we do a little mid shift there?
Sure.

3530
02:27:46,670 --> 02:27:48,840
We can do a little mid ship.
So I was talking to Jordan about

3531
02:27:48,841 --> 02:27:51,750
something that I think is kind of
interesting that I haven't talked about

3532
02:27:51,751 --> 02:27:53,790
publicly before and I thought if I'm
going to come on Joe Rogan,

3533
02:27:53,820 --> 02:27:56,370
let me see if I can bust out something
kind of personal.

3534
02:27:56,670 --> 02:27:59,130
So you know,
Jordan was having all these autoimmune

3535
02:27:59,131 --> 02:28:01,530
problems and that's kind of what led him
to,

3536
02:28:01,890 --> 02:28:04,260
uh,
to doing this crazy diet where he in

3537
02:28:04,261 --> 02:28:06,280
effect is on the carnivore diet.
Yeah.

3538
02:28:06,290 --> 02:28:09,780
Like it's like meat.
That's it feel doing that.

3539
02:28:09,870 --> 02:28:11,700
Great.
He looks so much better.

3540
02:28:11,730 --> 02:28:13,740
Even even then,
probably last time he was here,

3541
02:28:13,741 --> 02:28:15,210
maybe what,
four or five months ago,

3542
02:28:15,460 --> 02:28:15,910
he,
he,

3543
02:28:15,910 --> 02:28:17,370
his skin looks good.
He looks,

3544
02:28:17,371 --> 02:28:18,720
he's got some color back in his face.

3545
02:28:18,720 --> 02:28:20,010
You know,
he's definitely lost some weight,

3546
02:28:20,011 --> 02:28:21,050
slimmed down a little bit,
but,

3547
02:28:21,110 --> 02:28:23,240
but in a good way.
His energy,

3548
02:28:23,241 --> 02:28:24,560
his back.
Um,

3549
02:28:24,610 --> 02:28:25,940
he just,
his hair looks better.

3550
02:28:25,941 --> 02:28:29,360
Like he just looks better.
Like I don't know all the science behind

3551
02:28:29,361 --> 02:28:32,540
the carnivore diet of whether you can do
it forever and not eat vegetables and

3552
02:28:32,541 --> 02:28:34,610
truly survive.
I don't know where you're getting the

3553
02:28:34,611 --> 02:28:37,340
rest of the nutrition that you need and
the rest of the vitamins and all that.

3554
02:28:37,341 --> 02:28:39,140
But,
but when I've gone out to dinner with

3555
02:28:39,141 --> 02:28:41,960
him over these things,
guy gets a freaking the biggest steak

3556
02:28:41,961 --> 02:28:45,290
you can imagine at every place.
Chops it up,

3557
02:28:45,560 --> 02:28:46,700
eats meat.
That's it.

3558
02:28:46,880 --> 02:28:48,090
Um,
so anyway,

3559
02:28:48,091 --> 02:28:51,890
so we were talking the other day in the
green room before the show that it's

3560
02:28:51,891 --> 02:28:56,840
interesting that he had this health
problem as his success was growing and

3561
02:28:56,841 --> 02:28:59,900
it's like you don't really think about
that in life because we all like to

3562
02:28:59,901 --> 02:29:03,740
think like as we're growing and getting
better and doing what we're supposed to

3563
02:29:03,741 --> 02:29:05,480
do,
that our health is kind of in line with

3564
02:29:05,481 --> 02:29:06,110
that.

3565
02:29:06,110 --> 02:29:07,640
So,
I've actually never talked about this

3566
02:29:07,641 --> 02:29:10,130
before,
but about two and a half years ago,

3567
02:29:10,131 --> 02:29:12,260
right when my show was really taking
off,

3568
02:29:12,470 --> 02:29:13,820
I think probably about the first time
we,

3569
02:29:13,860 --> 02:29:16,940
we did our first sit down,
so not the one last year but two in

3570
02:29:16,941 --> 02:29:21,260
about two and half years ago as I was
for also first getting hate online at

3571
02:29:21,261 --> 02:29:25,040
the same time I started losing tons of
chunks of hair,

3572
02:29:25,760 --> 02:29:27,490
tons.
Like I'd be in the shower.

3573
02:29:27,640 --> 02:29:29,720
Yeah.
And tons of hair would be everywhere

3574
02:29:29,721 --> 02:29:34,721
after I showered hair in my towels and
everything and lost like huge patches

3575
02:29:34,731 --> 02:29:36,470
back of my head,
up top,

3576
02:29:36,740 --> 02:29:40,100
like all over the place.
So I had a al or I have,

3577
02:29:40,101 --> 02:29:43,610
I guess I technically still have it,
alopecia areata where it's an autoimmune

3578
02:29:43,611 --> 02:29:45,080
thing.
They don't know why your white blood

3579
02:29:45,081 --> 02:29:47,840
cells start attacking your hair
follicles.

3580
02:29:48,100 --> 02:29:50,570
Um,
so I went about two years ago and again,

3581
02:29:50,571 --> 02:29:52,970
this is just as I'm like starting to
really succeed.

3582
02:29:52,970 --> 02:29:55,400
Like I'm really just like breaking
through for the first time.

3583
02:29:55,850 --> 02:29:59,600
And uh,
I went on this like crazy experimental

3584
02:29:59,601 --> 02:30:01,370
drug.
So usually when you have this,

3585
02:30:01,670 --> 02:30:05,240
they just shoot cortisone into your
cortico corticosteroids into your head

3586
02:30:05,241 --> 02:30:09,320
and they hope that that basically
reverses it or stops or whatever reduces

3587
02:30:09,321 --> 02:30:12,020
the inflammation that's causing us
something like that.

3588
02:30:12,021 --> 02:30:15,510
And,
but my case was so severe that I went

3589
02:30:15,511 --> 02:30:16,880
to,
I found this doctor who's doing this

3590
02:30:16,881 --> 02:30:18,470
really experimental thing,
we're in effect,

3591
02:30:18,471 --> 02:30:23,450
they're putting something like poison
ivy on your head so that your white

3592
02:30:23,451 --> 02:30:26,720
blood cells will attack that instead of
attacking your hair follicles.

3593
02:30:26,721 --> 02:30:30,740
And the hope is if you do just the
slight amount that's necessary that you

3594
02:30:30,741 --> 02:30:33,140
won't have like crazy reactions and
you'll be,

3595
02:30:33,141 --> 02:30:35,330
and your hair eventually grow back.
Anyway.

3596
02:30:35,420 --> 02:30:39,560
I did it for about a year and first off
when I was on camera,

3597
02:30:39,561 --> 02:30:41,120
I mean there were points where like I
was like,

3598
02:30:41,121 --> 02:30:42,050
oh my God,
like I don't,

3599
02:30:42,080 --> 02:30:43,060
I can't be on academy more.

3600
02:30:43,070 --> 02:30:46,550
I was doing like,
not spray hair but like powdered shit

3601
02:30:46,551 --> 02:30:49,670
and like grew out my hair to like hide
so that we'll later I can show you.

3602
02:30:49,671 --> 02:30:51,380
Like I still actually do have some spots
here.

3603
02:30:51,800 --> 02:30:53,390
Um,
but anyway I went under this

3604
02:30:53,420 --> 02:30:57,530
experimental stuff and literally for two
years,

3605
02:30:57,590 --> 02:31:01,190
virtually my entire body was broken out
like red,

3606
02:31:01,220 --> 02:31:02,570
itchy,
Gross,

3607
02:31:02,571 --> 02:31:04,300
disgusting.
My head was like,

3608
02:31:04,540 --> 02:31:06,080
like terrific years.
Yeah,

3609
02:31:06,560 --> 02:31:11,030
for like a year bad and then and then a
year not as bad but like Ge,

3610
02:31:11,070 --> 02:31:13,790
like oozing my head like as if you had
poison ivy.

3611
02:31:13,791 --> 02:31:18,791
I was literally basically putting poison
ivy on my head and like I was sensitive

3612
02:31:19,831 --> 02:31:24,500
to heat and light and like it was,
it was a truly misery.

3613
02:31:24,520 --> 02:31:27,000
I had like a real,
oh I gained weight because of it.

3614
02:31:27,001 --> 02:31:29,160
Cause it likes screws up.
You're like my,

3615
02:31:29,180 --> 02:31:30,720
my neck actually look thicker.

3616
02:31:30,720 --> 02:31:33,900
Like I look at videos where I did not
look good for a year.

3617
02:31:33,930 --> 02:31:37,380
Like I look kind of bloated because my
body was basically having like an

3618
02:31:37,381 --> 02:31:41,070
allergic reaction at all times.
I was putting something on my head to

3619
02:31:41,071 --> 02:31:44,130
cause my body to have an allergic
reaction like it for whatever reason I

3620
02:31:44,131 --> 02:31:46,050
was just very sensitive to it.
But anyway,

3621
02:31:46,051 --> 02:31:48,090
I bring this all up.
Hey Cause I've never talked about it and

3622
02:31:48,091 --> 02:31:50,910
I thought it would might just be
something to like throw out there.

3623
02:31:51,210 --> 02:31:53,850
But B,
what I've discussed with Jordan is just

3624
02:31:53,851 --> 02:31:57,570
this interesting idea of sort of as
you're succeeding and as you're doing

3625
02:31:57,571 --> 02:32:01,050
what you're supposed to be doing,
that life just throws you weird things.

3626
02:32:01,440 --> 02:32:02,880
And I'm,
I'm pretty much over it now.

3627
02:32:02,881 --> 02:32:05,010
I'll show you later.
Like I definitely have some stuff still

3628
02:32:05,011 --> 02:32:05,844
that,
um,

3629
02:32:05,850 --> 02:32:08,190
now I'm just taking the injections and
we'll see what happens.

3630
02:32:08,550 --> 02:32:10,800
Um,
but don't you think it's stress related?

3631
02:32:11,400 --> 02:32:13,200
Yeah,
so I'd really Jordan doing the float

3632
02:32:13,201 --> 02:32:14,520
tanks.
Now I'm doing the Saunas.

3633
02:32:14,521 --> 02:32:16,350
I get massages every couple of weeks
now.

3634
02:32:16,380 --> 02:32:17,670
Um,
I'm definitely trying.

3635
02:32:17,700 --> 02:32:21,270
That's why I did the month off.
Jordan was not famous his whole life

3636
02:32:21,290 --> 02:32:24,000
now.
And then in his fifties became famous.

3637
02:32:24,390 --> 02:32:28,530
That is not,
it's a not a normal state that people

3638
02:32:28,531 --> 02:32:31,770
are accustomed to.
Even a clinical psychologist and a

3639
02:32:31,771 --> 02:32:35,490
professor and a professor.
And you know,

3640
02:32:35,550 --> 02:32:36,810
there's,
I mean,

3641
02:32:36,811 --> 02:32:40,620
how many stories do we have to read
about people who go famous and lose

3642
02:32:40,621 --> 02:32:41,860
their fucking marbles?
Yeah.

3643
02:32:41,880 --> 02:32:43,680
It's not an easy road.
It's not,

3644
02:32:43,710 --> 02:32:45,840
it's not easy to handle.
People ask him about that.

3645
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,960
So when we do the q and a at the end
there's an APP that people submit

3646
02:32:48,961 --> 02:32:50,730
questions and then I just kind of
moderate it.

3647
02:32:50,731 --> 02:32:52,740
So I picked some funny ones and then I
picked some serious ones.

3648
02:32:52,740 --> 02:32:55,140
But a lot of the questions are asked him
directly about that,

3649
02:32:55,530 --> 02:32:58,170
about what it,
what pressure do you feel now that

3650
02:32:58,171 --> 02:32:59,010
you're famous,
what is,

3651
02:32:59,020 --> 02:33:01,180
what if you screw up,
what if a lot,

3652
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:03,770
you know they also ask them what lot,
which I think is a great question and,

3653
02:33:03,771 --> 02:33:06,210
and I don't want to paraphrase his
answer because I won't do it justice,

3654
02:33:06,600 --> 02:33:07,530
but they ask him,
you know,

3655
02:33:07,531 --> 02:33:09,780
you talk about religion and archetypes
and all that,

3656
02:33:09,810 --> 02:33:12,300
are you a profit?
They will ask him now,

3657
02:33:12,301 --> 02:33:13,920
not because they're saying he's a
prophet,

3658
02:33:13,921 --> 02:33:16,470
but like if you believe in all of this
stuff,

3659
02:33:16,500 --> 02:33:18,510
if you believe that product you factor
in,

3660
02:33:18,550 --> 02:33:19,430
right.
And he,

3661
02:33:19,431 --> 02:33:21,570
he goes out of his way to say he doesn't
believe that.

3662
02:33:21,571 --> 02:33:23,350
And he's not trying to make anyone drink
koolaid.

3663
02:33:23,351 --> 02:33:26,360
He's trying to help have them live the
best life for themself,

3664
02:33:26,370 --> 02:33:28,140
not in life that he's laying out for
them.

3665
02:33:28,560 --> 02:33:30,180
Um,
but,

3666
02:33:30,330 --> 02:33:32,790
but watching him go through all this,
it's just been,

3667
02:33:33,420 --> 02:33:35,910
it's been truly fascinating.
Like it really,

3668
02:33:35,911 --> 02:33:37,890
it's like,
and then I think I said it before,

3669
02:33:37,891 --> 02:33:39,840
but it like the whole thing is like this
love fest.

3670
02:33:39,841 --> 02:33:44,320
It's not what they want it to be.
It's not the people that are writing all

3671
02:33:44,321 --> 02:33:47,250
of these pieces and who often,
I invite a lot of the writers sometimes

3672
02:33:47,251 --> 02:33:48,120
that right things.
I'll be like,

3673
02:33:48,121 --> 02:33:50,910
you want to come to the show tonight at
any of them are welcome to come as my

3674
02:33:50,911 --> 02:33:52,230
guests.
They can sit right up front.

3675
02:33:52,231 --> 02:33:53,640
I'll do the exact same thing,
Jordan.

3676
02:33:53,641 --> 02:33:55,230
We'll do the exact,
so you know what's good about those

3677
02:33:55,231 --> 02:33:58,140
people.
What's good about is the same thing that

3678
02:33:58,141 --> 02:34:01,650
I try to do with all my material.
I look at it and I learned this from

3679
02:34:01,651 --> 02:34:02,461
Doug.
Stan hope,

3680
02:34:02,461 --> 02:34:05,280
Doug Stan hope actually said it to me
and I realized I kind of do it,

3681
02:34:05,281 --> 02:34:08,100
but from him saying it,
I did it more.

3682
02:34:08,640 --> 02:34:12,780
He said,
you should write your bits as if you're

3683
02:34:12,781 --> 02:34:16,290
a defense attorney,
like you're defending your bit like

3684
02:34:16,320 --> 02:34:18,160
right.
Your bit like as if

3685
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:19,710
you,
and so I,

3686
02:34:19,910 --> 02:34:24,640
I think that one of the things about
having haters out there or critics out

3687
02:34:24,641 --> 02:34:26,710
there is that they're examining your
material,

3688
02:34:26,711 --> 02:34:30,100
finding holes in it.
And I think if you go over all of your

3689
02:34:30,101 --> 02:34:34,910
material and all of your ideas from the
perspective of someone is watching,

3690
02:34:34,911 --> 02:34:37,960
I'm right now trying to find fault in
everything that you do.

3691
02:34:37,990 --> 02:34:40,030
You will find it.
Just be undeniable.

3692
02:34:40,060 --> 02:34:41,410
Just be undeniable.
Find,

3693
02:34:41,411 --> 02:34:43,150
find those holes,
patch him up.

3694
02:34:43,420 --> 02:34:45,430
And you know,
there's going to be disagreements.

3695
02:34:45,431 --> 02:34:49,140
It's not like you're always going to be
able to state your point and it's going

3696
02:34:49,141 --> 02:34:49,980
to be,
uh,

3697
02:34:50,110 --> 02:34:53,320
undeniable to someone who completely
disagrees,

3698
02:34:53,860 --> 02:34:56,440
you know,
ideologically with your stance on

3699
02:34:56,441 --> 02:34:57,550
whatever the fuck it is.
But no,

3700
02:34:57,551 --> 02:34:59,770
as long as you,
it's undeniable to you,

3701
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:00,760
uh,
you've,

3702
02:35:00,760 --> 02:35:04,210
you've rationally made your case.
You've objectively stated the facts.

3703
02:35:04,211 --> 02:35:04,600
You've,
you've,

3704
02:35:04,600 --> 02:35:06,910
this is your position and this is why.
And you could back it up.

3705
02:35:07,270 --> 02:35:10,960
There's too much sloppy work going on
where people think they can and you see

3706
02:35:10,961 --> 02:35:14,260
this a lot,
there's a lot on the progressive left or

3707
02:35:14,261 --> 02:35:15,880
the regressive left or what do you want
to call it,

3708
02:35:15,881 --> 02:35:19,690
where they just expect that other people
are just going to agree with their

3709
02:35:19,691 --> 02:35:20,980
stance on things.
So they,

3710
02:35:21,070 --> 02:35:22,480
they,
they have this sort of

3711
02:35:23,200 --> 02:35:27,300
will,
this very rigid ideology that they're,

3712
02:35:27,301 --> 02:35:30,130
they're trying to put out.
They often think that they're morally

3713
02:35:30,131 --> 02:35:30,590
right.
Yeah.

3714
02:35:30,590 --> 02:35:32,920
So then you don't have to do the leg
work of the arguments.

3715
02:35:32,980 --> 02:35:37,330
It's a lot harder to take a position
that says you should be who you are and

3716
02:35:37,331 --> 02:35:40,000
you have to fit that into society rather
than saying,

3717
02:35:40,240 --> 02:35:44,770
this is what the moral imperative is.
This is why we need those laws.

3718
02:35:44,771 --> 02:35:47,110
And if you deviate from that,
you're the bad guy.

3719
02:35:47,111 --> 02:35:49,960
So unfortunately they've just embraced
that,

3720
02:35:50,170 --> 02:35:52,090
I think too much.
So it's like,

3721
02:35:52,091 --> 02:35:54,700
it's like one of those things like when
I go to these colleges and I'm usually

3722
02:35:54,701 --> 02:35:59,140
invited by libertarians and it's like
the returns want low taxes and limited

3723
02:35:59,141 --> 02:36:00,580
government and live how you want to
live.

3724
02:36:00,610 --> 02:36:01,030
Right.
That.

3725
02:36:01,030 --> 02:36:03,460
That's the basics of it.
But they'll often say,

3726
02:36:03,461 --> 02:36:05,470
you know,
I talk about low taxes in a college

3727
02:36:05,471 --> 02:36:07,030
class and people say I'm racist.

3728
02:36:07,450 --> 02:36:08,170
And it's like,
well,

3729
02:36:08,170 --> 02:36:12,310
how does race get into that?
But what they will say is that what

3730
02:36:12,311 --> 02:36:12,971
they'll say is,
well,

3731
02:36:12,971 --> 02:36:14,410
wait a minute.
If you want low taxes,

3732
02:36:14,411 --> 02:36:18,130
that means you don't want money going to
people who need it more.

3733
02:36:18,131 --> 02:36:20,920
And often it is people of color who need
it more.

3734
02:36:20,921 --> 02:36:25,750
So you inherently are racist.
You have to think on how to make the

3735
02:36:25,751 --> 02:36:26,820
counter argument to that.
The,

3736
02:36:26,840 --> 02:36:29,260
I think there's a very valid counter
argument that I buy into,

3737
02:36:29,590 --> 02:36:32,710
but you have to think it's very easy to
just take somebody who thinks the

3738
02:36:32,711 --> 02:36:34,390
reverse of you and go,
you're racist.

3739
02:36:34,930 --> 02:36:39,040
You're race such such a lazy way to
approach an idea.

3740
02:36:39,100 --> 02:36:39,990
Yeah.
Yeah.

3741
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
It's so lazy.
The only thing I,

3742
02:36:42,001 --> 02:36:45,790
I've a problem with what Jordan has been
saying lately is this idea of enforced

3743
02:36:45,791 --> 02:36:50,791
monogamy being the solution to insoles,
these involuntary celibates that's not

3744
02:36:51,101 --> 02:36:53,010
going to help.
So what do you think the,

3745
02:36:53,030 --> 02:36:54,190
I become men.
Well,

3746
02:36:54,191 --> 02:36:56,410
what do you think his definition of
enforcement argument is?

3747
02:36:56,411 --> 02:36:59,590
Just to be clear with the horse,
monogamy were people,

3748
02:36:59,650 --> 02:37:00,640
you know,
the,

3749
02:37:00,670 --> 02:37:04,960
the culture encourages and supports the
idea of monogamy.

3750
02:37:05,200 --> 02:37:06,610
Yeah.
In effect,

3751
02:37:06,611 --> 02:37:08,620
he's talking about Matt,
he's just talking about marriage and

3752
02:37:08,621 --> 02:37:10,030
that,
but that's not going to clear that way

3753
02:37:10,050 --> 02:37:12,840
to people that no one wants to fuck.
It's just not going to,

3754
02:37:12,841 --> 02:37:15,860
the idea is that there's a bunch of men
out there that are taking all the viable

3755
02:37:15,861 --> 02:37:16,370
females

3756
02:37:16,370 --> 02:37:17,990
because no one's getting married and
they're just,

3757
02:37:18,200 --> 02:37:19,820
there's no room for these insoles.
No.

3758
02:37:20,210 --> 02:37:24,770
They are not attractive to women,
whether they're not physically

3759
02:37:24,771 --> 02:37:27,050
attractive.
He told me Harvey Weinstein was

3760
02:37:27,051 --> 02:37:29,330
physically attractive.
That's fucking disgusting pig.

3761
02:37:29,480 --> 02:37:33,140
Forget about what he did to those women
are the rapes or the sexual assaults.

3762
02:37:33,230 --> 02:37:36,350
He had a gorgeous wife.
His wife is gorgeous.

3763
02:37:36,351 --> 02:37:38,720
That was a voluntary relationship.
Okay,

3764
02:37:38,721 --> 02:37:41,300
so how did that happen?
It happened through success.

3765
02:37:41,510 --> 02:37:44,420
It happened through success and
confidence and whatever the fuck else

3766
02:37:44,421 --> 02:37:47,660
he's got intellect.
I don't know what his mind's like.

3767
02:37:48,020 --> 02:37:49,920
These,
these insoles,

3768
02:37:50,240 --> 02:37:52,430
they have to become men.
Okay.

3769
02:37:52,490 --> 02:37:54,260
And there's a word.
It's all about that.

3770
02:37:54,261 --> 02:37:57,790
I mean his whole message is right.
I just don't think that enforced

3771
02:37:57,800 --> 02:38:01,020
monogamy has any factor whatsoever in
this.

3772
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:02,630
So he,
I think he would say this,

3773
02:38:02,631 --> 02:38:06,590
but I'm not as lawyer,
but I think he used the phrase all he

3774
02:38:06,591 --> 02:38:07,520
meant was marriage.

3775
02:38:07,550 --> 02:38:11,300
That generally societies that more
people are married and let's just say

3776
02:38:11,320 --> 02:38:13,100
married.
So I think going to help.

3777
02:38:13,160 --> 02:38:15,350
I think perhaps if he was being
interviewed again by,

3778
02:38:15,410 --> 02:38:17,210
by her,
he would use a different phrase.

3779
02:38:17,280 --> 02:38:18,830
Even if they,
even if he says marriage,

3780
02:38:18,831 --> 02:38:21,950
marriage is not going to help in cells.
These guys that are involuntary

3781
02:38:21,960 --> 02:38:24,230
celibate,
they have to become attractive so they

3782
02:38:24,231 --> 02:38:26,780
have to become men.
Well the rest of his messages about

3783
02:38:26,781 --> 02:38:29,180
that,
but they have to do difficult things.

3784
02:38:29,181 --> 02:38:30,560
Yeah.
That's what they have to do.

3785
02:38:30,590 --> 02:38:32,300
They have to,
they have to deal shit,

3786
02:38:32,301 --> 02:38:34,070
confidence,
get your shit together.

3787
02:38:34,430 --> 02:38:37,220
And martial arts I think is one of the
best ways to do that.

3788
02:38:37,221 --> 02:38:39,700
I've seen so many men that were like
sick,

3789
02:38:39,770 --> 02:38:44,770
insecure and Dorky and w they become
fucking nerd assassins through martial

3790
02:38:45,141 --> 02:38:45,741
arts.
And it did.

3791
02:38:45,741 --> 02:38:49,030
I think it's a great way to build
confidence and I think there's an

3792
02:38:49,040 --> 02:38:54,040
extreme lack of adversity,
like physical adversity and a lot of

3793
02:38:54,321 --> 02:38:55,154
people's lives.

3794
02:38:55,280 --> 02:38:58,640
And overcoming physical adversity is
what leads to a lot of confidence in

3795
02:38:58,641 --> 02:39:00,980
men.
And I just think that there's a lot of

3796
02:39:00,981 --> 02:39:05,720
men that are just have no idea whether
they can or can't do anything difficult.

3797
02:39:05,721 --> 02:39:07,610
And they have massive insecurity because
of it.

3798
02:39:07,910 --> 02:39:10,880
I think he would agree with every word.
I think he went to everywhere that you

3799
02:39:10,881 --> 02:39:11,880
just said there.
Yeah.

3800
02:39:11,900 --> 02:39:13,580
I just think that marriage is not fixing
it.

3801
02:39:13,660 --> 02:39:15,650
You know,
culturally enforced monogamy's not going

3802
02:39:15,651 --> 02:39:19,640
to fix it.
They have to become men and women was to

3803
02:39:19,641 --> 02:39:21,800
have a reason to want to have sex with
you.

3804
02:39:21,850 --> 02:39:22,820
Yeah.
Yeah.

3805
02:39:22,930 --> 02:39:25,160
So I think he would agree with that.
I think he would say that once you

3806
02:39:25,161 --> 02:39:28,310
accomplish that,
that that's when you will find more

3807
02:39:28,311 --> 02:39:32,060
women and that the next step,
the next natural progression in life is

3808
02:39:32,061 --> 02:39:35,150
that you will find someone that you want
to be partnered with and that that then

3809
02:39:35,420 --> 02:39:37,610
has the best value for our society.

3810
02:39:38,030 --> 02:39:40,460
But I don't want to completely state his
case.

3811
02:39:40,510 --> 02:39:42,080
Hmm.
It's an interesting case,

3812
02:39:42,260 --> 02:39:43,520
but he completely,
I mean,

3813
02:39:43,521 --> 02:39:45,620
look,
why is it that for the little bit that

3814
02:39:45,621 --> 02:39:48,740
these articles get right about him?
It's that he's helping men.

3815
02:39:48,770 --> 02:39:49,770
He is,
yes.

3816
02:39:49,790 --> 02:39:51,410
He's also helping women.
But yes,

3817
02:39:51,710 --> 02:39:54,530
he is helping men.
Men need their shit together.

3818
02:39:54,560 --> 02:39:56,300
They need framework for sure.
I mean,

3819
02:39:56,301 --> 02:39:59,330
people need this,
this thing about discipline and you

3820
02:39:59,331 --> 02:39:59,960
know,
uh,

3821
02:39:59,960 --> 02:40:00,690
you are,
you,

3822
02:40:00,690 --> 02:40:01,640
are you aware of,
you know,

3823
02:40:01,670 --> 02:40:03,670
you're aware of Jocko Jocko willink.
Yeah.

3824
02:40:03,770 --> 02:40:07,580
That discipline equals freedom.
It's like one of the best catch phrases.

3825
02:40:07,581 --> 02:40:09,020
It's so,
it's empowering.

3826
02:40:09,050 --> 02:40:12,260
It's so empowering.
Get your shit together and then you,

3827
02:40:12,261 --> 02:40:14,070
the time that have for

3828
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:16,380
recreation,
you'll appreciate it so much more.

3829
02:40:16,650 --> 02:40:19,680
You don't appreciate rest when you're
fucking off all day.

3830
02:40:20,020 --> 02:40:22,020
You're appreciate rest.
When you've worked hard,

3831
02:40:22,260 --> 02:40:25,110
that's when it means something to you.
When you've accomplished goals,

3832
02:40:25,111 --> 02:40:28,710
that's when this celebration is,
is something that you,

3833
02:40:28,810 --> 02:40:31,710
you get a good feeling from it.
Do you have a part in your life that you

3834
02:40:31,711 --> 02:40:35,820
feel like is lacking in that department?
In what department and just like getting

3835
02:40:35,821 --> 02:40:38,040
your shit together,
like not slacking on.

3836
02:40:38,410 --> 02:40:39,750
I'm pretty good at that.
Yeah.

3837
02:40:39,780 --> 02:40:40,950
That's what I do.
Yeah.

3838
02:40:41,010 --> 02:40:42,240
I mean,
I do a lot of shit.

3839
02:40:42,260 --> 02:40:45,570
They're the only way I could ever do as
many different things as I do is if I

3840
02:40:45,571 --> 02:40:46,850
just get after it.
Yeah.

3841
02:40:47,310 --> 02:40:50,250
I get after it pretty fucking good.
Yeah.

3842
02:40:50,310 --> 02:40:52,980
And I'm not,
I'm not an insecure in that.

3843
02:40:53,250 --> 02:40:55,770
I mean,
whether it's through martial arts or any

3844
02:40:55,771 --> 02:40:59,070
kind of exercise or work,
I just,

3845
02:40:59,130 --> 02:41:01,260
I take pride in getting things done.

3846
02:41:01,560 --> 02:41:03,680
I take pride in working,
you know,

3847
02:41:03,720 --> 02:41:06,660
especially working towards things that
are important to me,

3848
02:41:06,661 --> 02:41:09,610
whether it's working on my set,
working on my stand up,

3849
02:41:09,750 --> 02:41:13,950
whether it's working on a podcast,
whether it's working on my martial arts

3850
02:41:13,951 --> 02:41:17,550
or my fitness or yoga or whatever.
I get after it.

3851
02:41:17,551 --> 02:41:19,250
Man,
did you got to?

3852
02:41:19,270 --> 02:41:20,250
Yeah,
and for me,

3853
02:41:20,251 --> 02:41:22,530
it's not a matter of whether or not it's
an option.

3854
02:41:22,531 --> 02:41:25,590
It's like brushing my teeth.
I don't decide one day,

3855
02:41:25,591 --> 02:41:27,390
oh,
I don't want to brush my teeth today.

3856
02:41:27,570 --> 02:41:31,740
I just fucking brush my teeth.
And when there's days where I'm doing

3857
02:41:31,741 --> 02:41:34,320
fasted cardio,
when that alarm goes off,

3858
02:41:34,560 --> 02:41:37,290
it's not a matter of whether or not a
shut the alarm off.

3859
02:41:37,350 --> 02:41:39,660
That's not an option.
You Get up,

3860
02:41:39,780 --> 02:41:43,170
you put your fucking shoes on,
you get the dog and you go running

3861
02:41:43,171 --> 02:41:46,590
because that's what you do.
And if you just decide that's what you

3862
02:41:46,591 --> 02:41:49,920
do,
then you get things done and then a

3863
02:41:49,920 --> 02:41:51,160
month later you're like,
oh shit,

3864
02:41:51,270 --> 02:41:54,990
we did this all month and then six
months later it's like,

3865
02:41:55,050 --> 02:41:56,970
oh I did this half a year.

3866
02:41:57,270 --> 02:41:59,400
And then if you're doing Jujitsu,
you're like,

3867
02:41:59,401 --> 02:42:00,990
oh shit,
look I got a blue belt.

3868
02:42:01,260 --> 02:42:02,940
Oh Shit.
Now I'm a purple belt.

3869
02:42:03,030 --> 02:42:05,280
And that's how you become a black belt.
You just,

3870
02:42:05,340 --> 02:42:06,710
you know,
and I got my,

3871
02:42:06,800 --> 02:42:09,930
the good type of progressive cause it
gets progressively easier too.

3872
02:42:10,080 --> 02:42:11,760
I told you I'm doing that.
It doesn't though.

3873
02:42:11,820 --> 02:42:13,080
It doesn't get easy.
You don't think so?

3874
02:42:13,081 --> 02:42:15,960
Cause it can hard every time that alarm
goes off like fuck.

3875
02:42:16,280 --> 02:42:19,020
But you for you now then,
right when you started,

3876
02:42:20,160 --> 02:42:22,140
I don't know man.
You know the reward of it,

3877
02:42:22,170 --> 02:42:24,480
you know that that reward is some
enforcement.

3878
02:42:24,510 --> 02:42:26,820
There's some enforcement in the success
that I've had in,

3879
02:42:26,821 --> 02:42:30,780
in completing these tasks,
but every fucking time I go to yoga

3880
02:42:30,781 --> 02:42:31,411
class,
I'm like,

3881
02:42:31,411 --> 02:42:35,100
oh Jesus,
90 minutes in 104 degree temperature

3882
02:42:35,101 --> 02:42:37,320
with these all these women that are
going to humiliate me.

3883
02:42:38,130 --> 02:42:40,230
They can definitely do things that you
can't do.

3884
02:42:40,980 --> 02:42:42,630
Well.
This is their tough man.

3885
02:42:42,660 --> 02:42:45,210
There's a lot of these older ladies that
are fucking tough.

3886
02:42:45,230 --> 02:42:45,991
Yeah.
You know,

3887
02:42:45,991 --> 02:42:48,270
they just gut it out.
I was just one lady that goes there.

3888
02:42:48,271 --> 02:42:51,150
She's like 60 years old.
She doesn't even bring water and this

3889
02:42:51,151 --> 02:42:53,960
lady's in there for 90 fucking minutes,
sweat it out.

3890
02:42:53,980 --> 02:42:55,400
She's there every time I go,
I'm like,

3891
02:42:55,800 --> 02:42:56,910
she's not bringing water.
You sure?

3892
02:42:56,911 --> 02:42:59,180
She's 60 she could be like 20 and just
dehydrated.

3893
02:43:00,220 --> 02:43:02,850
Oh,
she's gray hair and tough as shit.

3894
02:43:02,851 --> 02:43:04,770
She drinks water before and she drinks
it after.

3895
02:43:04,771 --> 02:43:06,810
But when she's in that class,
he's just tough.

3896
02:43:07,350 --> 02:43:08,340
It's just,
you know,

3897
02:43:08,590 --> 02:43:10,620
they're there.
It's never easy to do.

3898
02:43:10,740 --> 02:43:12,550
You know?
It gets a little bit easier when you get

3899
02:43:12,551 --> 02:43:14,590
better at it.
But then you just try harder and it

3900
02:43:14,591 --> 02:43:15,610
makes it more difficult.

3901
02:43:15,610 --> 02:43:17,320
If you're always giving a hundred
percent effort,

3902
02:43:17,321 --> 02:43:19,120
it's always going to be hard.
You know,

3903
02:43:19,121 --> 02:43:21,160
you,
you take some pride in the fact that now

3904
02:43:21,161 --> 02:43:24,370
I can go two miles through the hills and
you know,

3905
02:43:24,371 --> 02:43:27,520
and reach the point of exhaustion where
before it was one or whatever,

3906
02:43:27,700 --> 02:43:30,790
whatever your little little progress
markers are,

3907
02:43:30,791 --> 02:43:34,360
you get some satisfaction that,
but it's always difficult to get going.

3908
02:43:34,361 --> 02:43:36,910
The the,
the hardest step is the first step is

3909
02:43:36,911 --> 02:43:40,420
not the 30th step or the hundredth step.
It's the fucking first one.

3910
02:43:40,600 --> 02:43:42,760
It's getting on the trail,
getting going.

3911
02:43:42,761 --> 02:43:45,400
It's the hardest thing.
The hardest weight to lift is the first

3912
02:43:45,401 --> 02:43:48,010
one.
Cause once you get going like okay,

3913
02:43:48,011 --> 02:43:50,160
I'm a half hour into my workout,
I'm writing things down.

3914
02:43:50,190 --> 02:43:51,880
I'm supposed to be doing now I got,
you know,

3915
02:43:52,240 --> 02:43:54,850
20 Chin ups,
then burpees and then all these days you

3916
02:43:54,851 --> 02:43:57,400
have to do it.
You just have to do it.

3917
02:43:57,430 --> 02:43:59,500
And so many people have a hard time
doing it.

3918
02:43:59,550 --> 02:44:00,840
If read in moving,

3919
02:44:00,900 --> 02:44:03,510
if you would have ever thought when you
started standup that you'd be sort of

3920
02:44:03,511 --> 02:44:05,190
like,
cause you're kind of like a lifestyle

3921
02:44:05,191 --> 02:44:06,660
guru in a in a way.
You know what I mean?

3922
02:44:06,661 --> 02:44:08,790
Like every time I've done the sensory
deprivation stuff,

3923
02:44:08,791 --> 02:44:11,700
ride the float stuff,
every time I've gone into the place when

3924
02:44:11,701 --> 02:44:13,680
I just talked to the girl,
when she's like setting it up or

3925
02:44:13,681 --> 02:44:14,401
something,
I'll be like,

3926
02:44:14,401 --> 02:44:16,740
oh Joe Rogan got me into this.
And they're always like,

3927
02:44:16,741 --> 02:44:18,570
oh Joe Rogan,
he got everybody into this.

3928
02:44:18,571 --> 02:44:21,450
Like you literally like created float
places.

3929
02:44:21,510 --> 02:44:23,100
All,
I went to one in Nashville,

3930
02:44:23,101 --> 02:44:24,450
like the woman was like,
oh Joe Rogan.

3931
02:44:24,451 --> 02:44:27,420
I love Joe Rogan,
but like that and the mma stuff and all

3932
02:44:27,421 --> 02:44:29,640
that.
Like what a bizarre adventure.

3933
02:44:29,641 --> 02:44:31,560
You know what I mean?
Like you probably would have never

3934
02:44:31,561 --> 02:44:32,320
thought

3935
02:44:32,320 --> 02:44:36,820
now that the only reason why it happened
because I had no intention of doing it.

3936
02:44:37,340 --> 02:44:39,310
It's like I didn't have to pull them
zero and time,

3937
02:44:39,311 --> 02:44:42,490
never written a book on lifestyle or
just fucking what to do.

3938
02:44:42,610 --> 02:44:45,790
I just say what I do and I do it by
example.

3939
02:44:45,791 --> 02:44:48,910
Like obviously I do all these things.
I mean that Jim's not there for looks.

3940
02:44:48,930 --> 02:44:50,530
Yeah,
I fucking do all these things.

3941
02:44:50,531 --> 02:44:51,820
So this is,
I think this is,

3942
02:44:52,240 --> 02:44:54,910
this is just a natural thing that's
happened,

3943
02:44:55,120 --> 02:44:59,030
but the float things,
the most bizarre one because I can't

3944
02:44:59,031 --> 02:45:03,050
believe I'm the one to tell everybody
but this doesn't he man.

3945
02:45:03,170 --> 02:45:05,960
But how the fuck doesn't everybody
already know they do now.

3946
02:45:05,961 --> 02:45:08,630
More people know now,
but how the fuck didn't they know when I

3947
02:45:08,631 --> 02:45:13,510
first got my tank in 2002 and um,
I had been talking about it for a couple

3948
02:45:13,510 --> 02:45:15,220
of years before because I had done one
where,

3949
02:45:15,221 --> 02:45:17,410
you know,
you go to a place and you rent it for an

3950
02:45:17,410 --> 02:45:18,243
hour.

3951
02:45:18,430 --> 02:45:20,300
That's how we regular people do it.
I get it.

3952
02:45:20,310 --> 02:45:23,650
You've got to get it.
I need one man fucking need.

3953
02:45:23,651 --> 02:45:25,240
When I tell you how often do you turn
it?

3954
02:45:25,300 --> 02:45:26,710
As much as I can.
I mean it's right there.

3955
02:45:26,740 --> 02:45:30,290
It's nice you're doing this more like
once a week or oh,

3956
02:45:30,340 --> 02:45:33,160
more than that for sure.
And I like to come in here,

3957
02:45:33,161 --> 02:45:33,880
you know,
different,

3958
02:45:33,880 --> 02:45:36,370
I'll come in here sometimes even after
the comedy store,

3959
02:45:36,730 --> 02:45:38,260
you know,
coming near Weird Times.

3960
02:45:38,261 --> 02:45:42,740
I'll come in here during the day.
But the whole idea is that this is

3961
02:45:42,741 --> 02:45:47,741
something that somehow or another was
created in the 60s by John Lilly and

3962
02:45:48,500 --> 02:45:52,030
nobody talked about it.
It was like kind of a suit,

3963
02:45:52,031 --> 02:45:54,730
Weirdo,
popular thing with hippies for awhile

3964
02:45:55,180 --> 02:45:58,300
and then it fucking went away.
But they were barely around.

3965
02:45:58,690 --> 02:46:01,180
And then I started talking about it and
now they're everywhere all over the

3966
02:46:01,181 --> 02:46:03,280
planet.
And that is the strangest thing to me.

3967
02:46:03,430 --> 02:46:07,000
It's one of the strangest things about
my entire career is that the float tank

3968
02:46:07,001 --> 02:46:08,890
business has sort of started up because
of me.

3969
02:46:08,980 --> 02:46:10,970
Yeah.
And that they're everywhere in the world

3970
02:46:10,971 --> 02:46:13,190
now.
There's hundreds of them everywhere in

3971
02:46:13,191 --> 02:46:15,770
every country and they didn't exist
before.

3972
02:46:16,610 --> 02:46:17,990
You know,
and that somehow or another,

3973
02:46:17,991 --> 02:46:20,450
you could directly connect them.
A lot of them.

3974
02:46:20,451 --> 02:46:22,010
To me that's very strange.

3975
02:46:22,170 --> 02:46:23,970
What does that say about ideas?
I mean,

3976
02:46:23,971 --> 02:46:27,660
what does that say about saying what you
think and explaining what your life is

3977
02:46:27,661 --> 02:46:29,130
to people?
That's what they want.

3978
02:46:29,131 --> 02:46:29,910
I mean,
I think when I,

3979
02:46:29,910 --> 02:46:31,950
when I'm with Jordan,
the thing I realized more than anything

3980
02:46:31,951 --> 02:46:36,180
else is he's giving them a little room
to be who they are.

3981
02:46:36,181 --> 02:46:38,280
He's taken some of the bullets,
you know,

3982
02:46:38,281 --> 02:46:40,200
the hit pieces and all that stuff that
we've talked about.

3983
02:46:40,410 --> 02:46:44,100
He takes a little bit of that to take
these positions that are not wrong,

3984
02:46:44,130 --> 02:46:48,150
but her just politically incorrect or
somewhat intraocular are controversial.

3985
02:46:48,570 --> 02:46:52,260
And by taking those positions,
he gives other people just a little bit

3986
02:46:52,261 --> 02:46:54,900
of a force field to think a little bit.
So,

3987
02:46:54,940 --> 02:46:57,000
so for you in this,
it's like you started doing something

3988
02:46:57,001 --> 02:47:00,330
that gave you a little peace of mind,
a little something that made you feel

3989
02:47:00,331 --> 02:47:03,510
good and feel healthy and clean and
mentally sound and all that.

3990
02:47:03,690 --> 02:47:06,330
And then you started talking about it
and then holy shit,

3991
02:47:06,331 --> 02:47:10,200
somebody in Nebraska was like,
I'm going to try that.

3992
02:47:10,530 --> 02:47:13,410
And the next thing you know,
she opened a clinic for it and is doing

3993
02:47:13,411 --> 02:47:14,041
it.
You know what I mean?

3994
02:47:14,041 --> 02:47:18,420
And then that that spurs and so if
that's the beauty of saying what you

3995
02:47:18,421 --> 02:47:18,980
think,

3996
02:47:18,980 --> 02:47:22,690
well it also works the same reason why
this podcast works like this pot.

3997
02:47:22,700 --> 02:47:25,640
I've never promoted this podcast.
I just did it.

3998
02:47:25,641 --> 02:47:27,650
And through word of mouth it got bigger
and bigger.

3999
02:47:27,680 --> 02:47:30,510
Yeah.
The thing about float tanks is I'm

4000
02:47:30,511 --> 02:47:33,330
telling you how amazing it is.
You try it and it doesn't suck.

4001
02:47:34,110 --> 02:47:36,420
You know what I mean?
It's not like if you don't enjoy that,

4002
02:47:36,421 --> 02:47:37,730
I don't know.
Yeah.

4003
02:47:37,740 --> 02:47:39,450
It's not like all these people went and
tried it out.

4004
02:47:39,451 --> 02:47:41,700
Like he fucking lied to me.
God dammit.

4005
02:47:41,730 --> 02:47:42,420
No,
they went to,

4006
02:47:42,420 --> 02:47:43,950
oh my God,
it's so relaxing.

4007
02:47:43,951 --> 02:47:45,510
It's amazing.
I got it.

4008
02:47:45,760 --> 02:47:48,310
Fresh perspective and my body feels
loose and relaxed.

4009
02:47:48,520 --> 02:47:51,010
This is crazy.
It's like there's a real positive

4010
02:47:51,011 --> 02:47:52,210
benefit.
I'm telling the truth.

4011
02:47:52,330 --> 02:47:55,540
How quick can you snap into the zone
that you want to get into and you're in

4012
02:47:55,541 --> 02:47:58,060
there.
Cause that's when I was just did it a

4013
02:47:58,060 --> 02:47:59,800
couple of days ago.
I've done it a couple times now and I've

4014
02:47:59,801 --> 02:48:02,980
usually been,
it takes me about 20 minutes to kind of

4015
02:48:02,981 --> 02:48:04,090
clear the clutter.
But you know,

4016
02:48:04,091 --> 02:48:05,590
sometimes it's more,
sometimes it's less.

4017
02:48:06,040 --> 02:48:08,230
This last time just cause I think we've
been traveling so much.

4018
02:48:08,231 --> 02:48:10,030
I've been planes every day and
everything else.

4019
02:48:10,240 --> 02:48:12,070
It wasn't till the law.
That's what it happens.

4020
02:48:12,071 --> 02:48:17,070
Like the last five minutes I finally got
to that place where I was kind of

4021
02:48:17,071 --> 02:48:19,110
disconnected.
But do you have a trick for that when

4022
02:48:19,111 --> 02:48:19,944
you get in there?

4023
02:48:19,960 --> 02:48:23,800
I've done it so many times that my body
knows what it's doing.

4024
02:48:23,830 --> 02:48:25,630
Yeah.
I lay in a tank and my body is like,

4025
02:48:25,720 --> 02:48:27,300
oh here we go.
Oh yeah,

4026
02:48:27,360 --> 02:48:28,840
just sink in.
But I've done it.

4027
02:48:29,020 --> 02:48:33,520
I don't know how many times I've had a
tank since 2002 so you're more tank

4028
02:48:34,360 --> 02:48:36,100
tank,
tank time,

4029
02:48:36,160 --> 02:48:38,500
you know,
and then I've been in there on mushrooms

4030
02:48:38,501 --> 02:48:42,790
and weed and you know,
we'd edibles especially that's the weird

4031
02:48:42,791 --> 02:48:45,500
one.
This marijuana edibles or the one on

4032
02:48:45,510 --> 02:48:49,900
some of the most underrated psychedelics
in terms of like introspective thinking,

4033
02:48:50,240 --> 02:48:51,730
self examination.
It's like,

4034
02:48:51,760 --> 02:48:56,020
it's one of those things that just
forces you to really go over every

4035
02:48:56,021 --> 02:48:59,230
single aspect of your subconscious
you're trying to hide from.

4036
02:48:59,880 --> 02:49:02,460
You got gotta.
You got a good strain of Endeca that's

4037
02:49:02,461 --> 02:49:06,690
not going to completely destroy me.
Like my weed situation at this point and

4038
02:49:06,691 --> 02:49:08,190
I used be a big pothead.
My weed

4039
02:49:08,190 --> 02:49:11,970
thing is like end of the night puff for
my vape pen,

4040
02:49:11,971 --> 02:49:16,290
like watch the same simpsons episode
that I loved in 1989 like that's good

4041
02:49:16,291 --> 02:49:17,940
enough for me.
Like I don't need,

4042
02:49:18,060 --> 02:49:20,850
like I know a lot of my comic friends,
like they want to smoke a sativa and

4043
02:49:20,910 --> 02:49:21,321
write,
write,

4044
02:49:21,321 --> 02:49:22,110
write,
and I'm like,

4045
02:49:22,110 --> 02:49:24,510
I've opened up enough doors in my brain.
If anything,

4046
02:49:24,511 --> 02:49:26,150
I'd tightened a couple of hinges,
you know what I mean?

4047
02:49:26,210 --> 02:49:29,130
I don't need to go the other way again.
Like for me it's much more about

4048
02:49:29,131 --> 02:49:32,760
relaxation.
Well there's a lot of great sativas or

4049
02:49:32,761 --> 02:49:34,740
indicas rather.
All you have to do is just go to any

4050
02:49:34,741 --> 02:49:37,620
store and then just take a little hit
and then we'll try it out.

4051
02:49:37,920 --> 02:49:40,140
Just the whole thing is just don't go
too deep.

4052
02:49:40,410 --> 02:49:43,080
Like people try three,
four or five hits and then never smoked

4053
02:49:43,081 --> 02:49:47,160
pot before and then they were in a k
hole in the corner crying and screaming.

4054
02:49:47,160 --> 02:49:48,850
And you know,
it's like Jesus,

4055
02:49:48,880 --> 02:49:49,770
what?
Your body doesn't know.

4056
02:49:49,771 --> 02:49:52,920
What the fuck to do with all that.
Thc like this,

4057
02:49:52,950 --> 02:49:53,810
watch this,
watch this.

4058
02:49:53,820 --> 02:49:55,740
I,
that's it.

4059
02:49:55,770 --> 02:49:57,060
You're good.
Blow it out.

4060
02:49:57,240 --> 02:49:59,220
Relax.
Give it an hour.

4061
02:49:59,430 --> 02:50:02,730
Find out what the fuck the effect is.
Don't just keep hitting it.

4062
02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:04,470
You know,
I've seen people that don't smoke.

4063
02:50:04,471 --> 02:50:09,471
Poggle I'll try
and then an hour later I'm like,

4064
02:50:10,381 --> 02:50:13,350
are you going to die?
You think you're going to die?

4065
02:50:13,380 --> 02:50:14,130
Like you,
you look,

4066
02:50:14,130 --> 02:50:15,630
you're freaked out man.
Yeah.

4067
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,570
Um,
so I back in the day,

4068
02:50:18,571 --> 02:50:20,070
like college and a little bit after
college,

4069
02:50:20,100 --> 02:50:21,660
I did mushrooms,
I don't know,

4070
02:50:21,661 --> 02:50:23,100
maybe 20 times in my life,
something,

4071
02:50:23,190 --> 02:50:25,410
something around there.
And then I haven't done it in about 15

4072
02:50:25,411 --> 02:50:27,030
years.
And then about six months ago,

4073
02:50:27,570 --> 02:50:30,270
so mushrooms appeared,
it doesn't matter how they were in my

4074
02:50:30,271 --> 02:50:31,170
house.
And I was like,

4075
02:50:31,171 --> 02:50:32,070
all right,
here's what we're going to do.

4076
02:50:32,100 --> 02:50:32,671
My,
my,

4077
02:50:32,671 --> 02:50:35,070
uh,
that's friends over and David was there

4078
02:50:35,430 --> 02:50:36,390
and we were like,
all right,

4079
02:50:36,420 --> 02:50:39,030
we're all just going to take one cap.
We're not going to like have a full

4080
02:50:39,090 --> 02:50:41,520
fucking pussies.
It's been a while,

4081
02:50:41,521 --> 02:50:42,354
man.
Come on.

4082
02:50:42,600 --> 02:50:43,261
So I was like,
you know,

4083
02:50:43,261 --> 02:50:44,880
we're just going to take one cat.
Okay.

4084
02:50:45,130 --> 02:50:47,370
See what did I do?
So we'll take a cap.

4085
02:50:47,371 --> 02:50:48,960
And we had smoked a little and we had
drank.

4086
02:50:48,961 --> 02:50:50,640
It was after dinner and we were just all
hanging out.

4087
02:50:50,641 --> 02:50:52,010
It was a couple of us and we were like,
all right,

4088
02:50:52,011 --> 02:50:53,850
we're going to go play some video games.
So we're playing,

4089
02:50:53,870 --> 02:50:56,490
uh,
like nba jam kind of thing,

4090
02:50:56,491 --> 02:50:58,770
you know?
And we're playing and plan,

4091
02:50:58,771 --> 02:50:59,604
plan,
plan.

4092
02:50:59,820 --> 02:51:00,840
And I'm going,
guys,

4093
02:51:00,841 --> 02:51:03,360
guys,
my controller's not working.

4094
02:51:03,390 --> 02:51:05,790
My controller is not working.
I can't control this.

4095
02:51:05,791 --> 02:51:06,870
Nothing's,
we're working.

4096
02:51:08,130 --> 02:51:09,210
David looks at me,
he's like,

4097
02:51:09,420 --> 02:51:10,740
you're not holding a controller.

4098
02:51:10,800 --> 02:51:13,530
I was playing on my leg.
I was actually,

4099
02:51:13,531 --> 02:51:14,970
I had the controller on my life.
Yeah.

4100
02:51:15,090 --> 02:51:16,440
I had no control over.
I was actually,

4101
02:51:16,441 --> 02:51:18,260
I thought it would.
So I'm telling you one cap,

4102
02:51:18,320 --> 02:51:20,340
you mocked me,
but one cap can do the trick.

4103
02:51:20,370 --> 02:51:22,890
That's the story with a,
you need to go to a doctor and find out

4104
02:51:22,891 --> 02:51:26,140
what's wrong with your brain.
One caption this.

4105
02:51:26,230 --> 02:51:27,510
Hmm.
Wow.

4106
02:51:27,590 --> 02:51:29,850
Worlds for more interesting than I
thought it was.

4107
02:51:30,120 --> 02:51:31,050
Video Games.
Rogan,

4108
02:51:31,890 --> 02:51:36,180
playstation four I jumped connected.
I have jumped right into like

4109
02:51:36,790 --> 02:51:40,680
playstation four you know,
video games are good when you're with a

4110
02:51:40,681 --> 02:51:43,740
little bit.
I would recommend once you get into the

4111
02:51:43,741 --> 02:51:46,380
two or three caps,
you put the fucking video games down.

4112
02:51:46,381 --> 02:51:48,330
Just lay down and think about your life.
Yeah,

4113
02:51:48,350 --> 02:51:50,430
I but I for video games,
like again,

4114
02:51:50,431 --> 02:51:53,100
I just want to have enough time.
So like I like old school,

4115
02:51:53,130 --> 02:51:55,290
eight bit run one way.

4116
02:51:55,290 --> 02:51:57,510
I want to run Wah Wah.
I want to run back.

4117
02:51:57,670 --> 02:51:58,503
Yeah.
I want that.

4118
02:51:58,530 --> 02:52:00,900
I want to run that way.
I don't even want to run backwards and I

4119
02:52:00,901 --> 02:52:03,450
definitely don't want to run this way.
I just want to run that way.

4120
02:52:03,451 --> 02:52:06,850
So Mary Oh metroid that kind of thing.
I tell you that new silly shit.

4121
02:52:06,880 --> 02:52:09,790
Yeah.
Like I want to blow some stuff up for a

4122
02:52:09,790 --> 02:52:10,331
few minutes.
I can,

4123
02:52:10,331 --> 02:52:12,760
you know,
I don't have to murder a family and rape

4124
02:52:12,910 --> 02:52:15,450
people into steel crown or,
I mean I,

4125
02:52:15,620 --> 02:52:17,650
you know,
I've raped a couple of prostitutes and

4126
02:52:17,651 --> 02:52:19,690
you know all that.
It's fun when you're doing it.

4127
02:52:19,691 --> 02:52:21,760
Someone's going to take those fucking
sound bytes.

4128
02:52:21,990 --> 02:52:24,910
There we go.
I see you subconsciously.

4129
02:52:24,911 --> 02:52:26,470
You give it to him.
You know,

4130
02:52:27,120 --> 02:52:29,710
I just gave it to little people.
Who are they?

4131
02:52:30,080 --> 02:52:30,950
Who are,
who are you?

4132
02:52:31,030 --> 02:52:32,350
Are they?
They all need a hug.

4133
02:52:32,380 --> 02:52:34,350
Everybody needs a hug.
I think do,

4134
02:52:34,730 --> 02:52:39,700
I'm less combative with every year,
less defiant and combative with every

4135
02:52:39,700 --> 02:52:41,470
year with this stuff.
I'm more shrugging than ever.

4136
02:52:41,471 --> 02:52:44,170
I'm like,
just try to be a nice person.

4137
02:52:44,390 --> 02:52:46,690
Tried and tried to be nice.
Try to be nice to each other.

4138
02:52:47,170 --> 02:52:49,360
Do you do your best at whatever you're
doing,

4139
02:52:49,630 --> 02:52:52,600
keep moving.
And when things pop up and people write,

4140
02:52:52,601 --> 02:52:53,500
things just go,

4141
02:52:54,180 --> 02:52:56,700
okay,
well what am I gonna do you think that

4142
02:52:56,701 --> 02:53:00,150
could be a connection though to
eventually killing the drive to want to

4143
02:53:00,151 --> 02:53:02,070
keep doing things,
like to want to keep being funny,

4144
02:53:02,071 --> 02:53:03,770
to want to keep getting out there?
No.

4145
02:53:03,780 --> 02:53:05,850
My drive is for the people that enjoy my
work.

4146
02:53:06,060 --> 02:53:07,740
My drop when I'm,
when I'm doing standup,

4147
02:53:08,020 --> 02:53:10,840
my drive is because I know there's a
bunch of people that are getting

4148
02:53:10,841 --> 02:53:13,180
babysitters and they,
they're there.

4149
02:53:13,181 --> 02:53:16,360
They bought tickets in advance and then
like next Friday,

4150
02:53:16,361 --> 02:53:18,010
Joe's coming to town and I'm,

4151
02:53:18,980 --> 02:53:22,640
I'm working hard for that.
I don't want them to have a bad

4152
02:53:22,641 --> 02:53:25,160
experience.
I want to do the best fucking show I can

4153
02:53:25,161 --> 02:53:27,410
do.
I'm dead serious about that.

4154
02:53:27,411 --> 02:53:30,200
That's very important to me.
I understand it's a massive

4155
02:53:30,201 --> 02:53:33,830
responsibility and I'm doing the Chicago
theater like I did last weekend.

4156
02:53:33,950 --> 02:53:36,320
Two shows,
3,700 people show.

4157
02:53:36,321 --> 02:53:39,890
That's a lot of fucking people.
I don't want anybody to be disappointed.

4158
02:53:39,891 --> 02:53:44,060
I want to do my best job the best I can
do and that's where my drive is.

4159
02:53:44,061 --> 02:53:46,940
My drive is to,
I'm dissecting material,

4160
02:53:46,941 --> 02:53:48,590
I'm rewriting it,
I'm practicing.

4161
02:53:48,591 --> 02:53:50,300
I'm going.
I went up three times last night.

4162
02:53:50,480 --> 02:53:52,720
I'll probably go up.
I'm going up at least two times tonight.

4163
02:53:52,730 --> 02:53:54,680
I'm doing the Improv and I'm doing the
comedy store.

4164
02:53:55,130 --> 02:53:56,510
I do that all the time,
man.

4165
02:53:56,570 --> 02:53:58,850
I do that all the time.
And my drive is to,

4166
02:53:59,180 --> 02:54:03,750
there's a great reward in making people
laugh and there's a great reward in,

4167
02:54:03,751 --> 02:54:06,650
in d we made an exchange,
you know,

4168
02:54:06,780 --> 02:54:08,000
uh,
they came to see me,

4169
02:54:08,001 --> 02:54:08,960
I made them laugh.

4170
02:54:08,960 --> 02:54:10,470
Everybody's happy.
Look,

4171
02:54:10,560 --> 02:54:12,560
we had a deal.
That's the deal.

4172
02:54:12,590 --> 02:54:14,660
And I've worked,
it's not an easy deal.

4173
02:54:14,661 --> 02:54:17,570
It's like you got to work hard to fill
your end of the bargain.

4174
02:54:18,020 --> 02:54:22,630
But if you do work hard and you do work
at it and you do examine it,

4175
02:54:22,650 --> 02:54:26,480
you do put in the hours on stage and you
do go over the rewrites and listen to

4176
02:54:26,481 --> 02:54:29,470
the recordings and do your best.
It's rewarding.

4177
02:54:29,490 --> 02:54:30,790
Yeah.
The reward is that I,

4178
02:54:30,800 --> 02:54:31,633
I,
I,

4179
02:54:31,900 --> 02:54:34,360
I can say that those people have a good
time.

4180
02:54:34,361 --> 02:54:37,420
Like when I put a video up on Instagram,
a bunch of people cheering after the

4181
02:54:37,421 --> 02:54:39,040
show,
my feeling,

4182
02:54:39,240 --> 02:54:40,990
what am I,
this is like,

4183
02:54:40,991 --> 02:54:43,240
we shared this time.
You guys had a good time.

4184
02:54:43,241 --> 02:54:44,980
I had a good time.
I'm super happy.

4185
02:54:45,040 --> 02:54:46,870
There's nothing like thank you.
Yeah.

4186
02:54:46,900 --> 02:54:48,610
Cause I told you I'm,
I'm just getting back in.

4187
02:54:48,611 --> 02:54:50,800
So I just booked my last couple of
hours.

4188
02:54:50,801 --> 02:54:52,540
So on the nights off that I'm with
Peterson.

4189
02:54:52,541 --> 02:54:56,350
So we sold out the DCM prep.
So that champion perhaps holdout Irvine

4190
02:54:56,350 --> 02:54:57,670
Improv here or by an Improv.
Yeah.

4191
02:54:57,840 --> 02:55:01,960
Urban apro and yeah,
I feel that now cause it's weird because

4192
02:55:01,961 --> 02:55:04,130
you don't know me from comedy.
So it's like

4193
02:55:04,130 --> 02:55:06,830
I did it.
I lived all those New York City years as

4194
02:55:06,831 --> 02:55:08,840
a comic,
never hit into,

4195
02:55:08,870 --> 02:55:12,050
I was a good comic,
but I never hit into to TV in that way.

4196
02:55:12,051 --> 02:55:14,630
And that's why I started doing all these
other things that led me to this.

4197
02:55:14,960 --> 02:55:17,630
But it's like they can put my name up
and now it sells out.

4198
02:55:17,690 --> 02:55:19,550
And I was,
it wasn't before.

4199
02:55:19,700 --> 02:55:20,780
Right.
So now it's like,

4200
02:55:20,781 --> 02:55:22,670
I feel this extra pressure of like,
wow,

4201
02:55:22,671 --> 02:55:24,890
these people,
like they're really coming from me.

4202
02:55:24,970 --> 02:55:28,390
It is extra pressure,
but it's reward to it too.

4203
02:55:28,430 --> 02:55:31,040
It's been awesome.
I mean it's like I'm getting back to

4204
02:55:31,041 --> 02:55:34,550
this thing that people don't know me
from and it's like I'm good.

4205
02:55:34,551 --> 02:55:35,420
I,
I sent you,

4206
02:55:35,421 --> 02:55:36,920
uh,
the hour.

4207
02:55:36,921 --> 02:55:38,810
I haven't sent it to anybody.
I'm not putting up publicly,

4208
02:55:38,811 --> 02:55:41,300
but I wanted you to see it because even
if you could only watch a minute,

4209
02:55:41,690 --> 02:55:44,030
because I wanted you to know that I'm a
real comic,

4210
02:55:44,060 --> 02:55:44,690
you know what I mean?

4211
02:55:44,690 --> 02:55:46,430
Like,
because otherwise it's like we can all

4212
02:55:46,431 --> 02:55:47,061
sit here and be like,
yeah,

4213
02:55:47,061 --> 02:55:48,230
I'm kind of blah,
blah,

4214
02:55:48,231 --> 02:55:49,550
blah.
Um,

4215
02:55:50,330 --> 02:55:52,610
but it's,
it's incredibly powerful.

4216
02:55:52,611 --> 02:55:55,490
Like when you're in that room with those
people and you make it real for that.

4217
02:55:55,491 --> 02:55:58,370
And I know my style,
like I'm never going to be the best joke

4218
02:55:58,371 --> 02:56:00,920
writer on the planet.
It's not where my passions lie,

4219
02:56:00,921 --> 02:56:05,490
but I like being in that room with these
people doing what we did here and,

4220
02:56:05,810 --> 02:56:08,750
and getting everybody playing and being
in the moment.

4221
02:56:08,751 --> 02:56:12,020
And I get people kind of yelling at each
other and screaming and announcing their

4222
02:56:12,021 --> 02:56:14,600
political differences and like all this
crazy shit.

4223
02:56:14,900 --> 02:56:17,690
And I don't know anyone that's doing it
the way that I'm doing it.

4224
02:56:17,960 --> 02:56:21,140
And it's not like I'm doing a set the
way Seinfeld with layout,

4225
02:56:21,170 --> 02:56:22,460
you know,
every word,

4226
02:56:22,610 --> 02:56:23,600
you know,
for the hour.

4227
02:56:23,900 --> 02:56:25,030
Um,
well not a,

4228
02:56:25,050 --> 02:56:25,610
but I love it.

4229
02:56:25,610 --> 02:56:27,200
Again.
It doesn't matter.

4230
02:56:27,201 --> 02:56:29,170
The beautiful thing about comedy is any
way you want it.

4231
02:56:29,380 --> 02:56:31,160
You do it your way,
your way.

4232
02:56:31,460 --> 02:56:32,720
Dave,
we just did three hours.

4233
02:56:32,930 --> 02:56:33,501
Shit,
man.

4234
02:56:33,501 --> 02:56:35,360
Now I got Sam Harris.
I've got to run home.

4235
02:56:35,361 --> 02:56:39,290
I came here from the airport already.
It's already three 20 that's crazy.

4236
02:56:39,410 --> 02:56:42,170
I got Harris at four I got to get the
hell Outta here.

4237
02:56:42,260 --> 02:56:42,980
Well,
thank you,

4238
02:56:42,980 --> 02:56:43,820
man.
It's always a pleasure.

4239
02:56:43,970 --> 02:56:44,661
Wait,
hold on.

4240
02:56:44,661 --> 02:56:47,630
Now I'm getting you official.
You went to Shapiro before me.

4241
02:56:47,810 --> 02:56:50,780
This is what I listen to.
Just it happened and it was free that

4242
02:56:50,780 --> 02:56:52,550
day.
We'll do your show.

4243
02:56:52,960 --> 02:56:55,370
All right.
I've so many other things to say to you.

4244
02:56:55,371 --> 02:56:57,280
Gentleman,
Dave Rubin backs brother.

4245
02:56:57,440 --> 02:57:02,440
Thank you.
[inaudible].
