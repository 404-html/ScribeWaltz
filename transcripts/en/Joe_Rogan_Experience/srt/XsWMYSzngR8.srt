1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,860
I would maybe I would maybe do.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,723
Hold on a second.

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,700
Don't,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,990
don't say a word.

5
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,340
Don't say a word.

6
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,540
Don't say a word until
this bitch gets cracking.

7
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,520
Bert Kreischer.

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,361
Bert Kreischer.

9
00:00:17,361 --> 00:00:18,480
I want you to keep it together.

10
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:19,620
I want you to hold on.

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,071
I'm holding,

12
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:23,550
wants you to realize this is a
gun damn commercial free podcast.

13
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,230
Exceptional addition is an
except the podcast was so good.

14
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:33,231
It cannot be stopped or the greater good
of Shiva or Odin or Thor or Cassiopeia.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,100
Did anybody ever wash up?

16
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:38,580
Cassiopeia is at the watch.

17
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,590
Some chick with some dude probably
wanted to fuck and he got all exaggerated

18
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:47,250
when she was named bear of fucking
constellation or some shit,

19
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:47,431
right?

20
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:49,140
Cassiopeia I bet her website's available.

21
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,530
That's good.

22
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,160
Is your pussy you have to be before
they named it constellation after it.

23
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,840
Not even like a tree.

24
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:55,830
Why on a rock,

25
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:56,730
not a mountain.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,241
No.

27
00:00:57,241 --> 00:01:01,470
A series of nuclear explosions
and the middle of the universe.

28
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,740
Why haven't they rebooted Thor and like
he got a haircut yet because [inaudible]

29
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:07,763
he's dope.

30
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:08,151
Don't be,

31
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:08,984
hey,

32
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:09,661
listen,

33
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:09,931
Brian,

34
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:10,980
you have a full head of hair.

35
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,820
You shouldn't be hating because I have
almost zero hair and I'm not hating.

36
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:15,480
Okay?

37
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,190
It's a matter of time
before I shaved my head.

38
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,150
It's your issues.

39
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:18,750
He should do it.

40
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,490
I just want to to the hair green things.

41
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,410
Oh yeah,

42
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,480
dude.

43
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,220
Shaving your head is a beautiful feeling.

44
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,751
Is it?

45
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:27,150
Do it.

46
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:27,721
Just do it.

47
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:28,410
Trust me.

48
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:29,310
Just do it once.

49
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,770
You obviously don't give
a fuck about your body.

50
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,900
Let's be realistic.

51
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:34,670
You've,

52
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,770
he's been working out a lot.

53
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,250
You're not gay.

54
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,303
You're you.

55
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,343
Let's be honest.

56
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:39,630
You know,

57
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,230
I love you,

58
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,070
but let's be honest.

59
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:42,930
If you were entering into
a bodybuilding contest,

60
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:44,550
I would say this guy does not want to win.

61
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,640
He is not trying to win sexiest.

62
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:47,990
Man.

63
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,860
I don't even look good in European speedo.

64
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,853
Oh,

65
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,580
not that there's anything wrong with that,

66
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,450
but let's be honest about our paths.

67
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,101
It's life,

68
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:02,791
ladies and gentlemen.

69
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:03,840
So death,

70
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:04,830
a death squad,

71
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:09,831
Scotland and desk got Ohio are losing
their fucking minds because they're told

72
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,300
you to stop communicating
with those people.

73
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:11,931
You don't know them.

74
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:12,930
You have not vetted them,

75
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,953
sir.

76
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,573
Brian does know,

77
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,203
goddammit.

78
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,700
None of them mother fuckers
have a proper filter in place.

79
00:02:20,701 --> 00:02:23,610
We need to fucking set ups a
scientific checks and balances.

80
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,700
Much like the CIA uses.

81
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,790
Can't just decide.

82
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,060
You're going to let some mother
fucker send you some whiskey.

83
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:30,660
Oh,

84
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,493
I can't put coconut.

85
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,740
We have a refrigerator here
at a higher primates studios.

86
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,210
We're so not fucking around,

87
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:37,050
ladies and gentlemen.

88
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:37,741
Okay.

89
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,240
We were taking this to the next level.

90
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:39,861
Bert Kreischer.

91
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:40,694
Do you see what we're doing here?

92
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,090
My own Buddha.

93
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,310
His fucking care package from on it.

94
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:44,581
Yeah.

95
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,500
You got a care package from on it.

96
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,290
Then we got the boot are
responsible for my tattoo.

97
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,371
What was that?

98
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,450
The Buddha taught like,

99
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,880
hi guys are here.

100
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:54,310
You're done.

101
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:54,781
But Tattoos.

102
00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:55,241
Are you going to,

103
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:55,771
are you going to,

104
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:57,060
I'm going to fill in my right arm.

105
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,040
Can we see your right?

106
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,253
That is the same.

107
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,433
Hmm.

108
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,830
The guy who did my arm,

109
00:03:04,831 --> 00:03:05,301
first of all,

110
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:09,950
he's a beautiful artist and he's a cool
mother fucker name is Aaron Dellavedova

111
00:03:09,951 --> 00:03:10,490
and he uh,

112
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,590
works at Guru Tattoo in San Diego.

113
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,460
I get,

114
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,410
I would get tattoo just to
hang out with that dude.

115
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,970
It's so cool.

116
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,500
I wonder if that,

117
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,333
I want to heal.

118
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,420
He's a real artist.

119
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,510
He usually eats really cool paintings.

120
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,540
I love his,

121
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,430
like his point of view.

122
00:03:25,431 --> 00:03:29,390
Like it's so uniquely his own that
you remember that guy that was uh,

123
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:29,781
uh,

124
00:03:29,781 --> 00:03:31,940
Jesse James Rather who's
married to Sandra Bullock.

125
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,970
Remember he had that affair with some
girl at Swat to Roscoe touch with him

126
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,340
before I saw no,

127
00:03:38,341 --> 00:03:38,481
no,

128
00:03:38,481 --> 00:03:38,571
no.

129
00:03:38,571 --> 00:03:39,440
She didn't have that.

130
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:39,771
Yes,

131
00:03:39,771 --> 00:03:39,990
yes.

132
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,160
No,

133
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,380
no,

134
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:40,611
no,

135
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:40,821
no,

136
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:40,971
no,

137
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:41,121
no,

138
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:41,291
no,

139
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:41,420
no,

140
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:41,590
no.

141
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,980
She was not a swipe power.

142
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:43,281
No,

143
00:03:43,281 --> 00:03:43,461
no,

144
00:03:43,461 --> 00:03:43,671
no,

145
00:03:43,671 --> 00:03:43,851
no,

146
00:03:43,851 --> 00:03:44,420
no.

147
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:44,631
Yeah,

148
00:03:44,631 --> 00:03:44,901
she did.

149
00:03:44,901 --> 00:03:45,830
How she did you?

150
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,560
She did not.

151
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,390
No,

152
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:47,631
no,

153
00:03:47,631 --> 00:03:47,811
no,

154
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:47,991
no,

155
00:03:47,991 --> 00:03:48,141
no,

156
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:48,321
no,

157
00:03:48,321 --> 00:03:48,560
no.

158
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,610
She had swastikas tattooed.

159
00:03:49,611 --> 00:03:50,260
So stop it.

160
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:50,480
Stop.

161
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:50,611
No,

162
00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:51,444
swear to God.

163
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,300
She's really good at telling you.

164
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,171
I'll be showing you.

165
00:03:54,171 --> 00:03:55,010
I'm telling you you're wrong.

166
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,030
What's her name is Michelle
dynamite or something like that.

167
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,661
But anyway,

168
00:03:59,661 --> 00:04:03,800
my point is that she had this sleeve
and I looked at the sleeve and I said,

169
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:05,570
that's an Aaron Dellavedova Tattoo.

170
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,160
I could tell that his style
is so distinctive and I'm uh,

171
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:10,701
I'm,

172
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:14,690
I'm such a huge fan of
individual points of expression.

173
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,161
Why?

174
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:15,620
Or like,

175
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,130
um,

176
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,910
like there's certain like pool cues where
you could look at the pool cue and you

177
00:04:19,911 --> 00:04:20,540
know,

178
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,940
that is a sugar tree.

179
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,170
That's a cue that Eric,

180
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:24,890
Chris May,

181
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,690
that is a cognizant that's acute,

182
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,790
that Joe Gold Mate,

183
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,280
but they have like this
individual point of expression.

184
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,110
Michelle,

185
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,520
Michelle,

186
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,353
my gate.

187
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:33,651
Yeah.

188
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:34,530
She did a Nazi.

189
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,870
That's what it was.

190
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,000
She want to have it attached.

191
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,170
Yeah.

192
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:41,720
She doesn't have tattoos like some
crazy photo shoot that she had to do.

193
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,850
Although it does say WP on her leg.

194
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,893
Yeah.

195
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,550
Like as in white power?

196
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,570
No.

197
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,690
Or how would it means yes or whoa.

198
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,920
Is that really what it means?

199
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,521
WP?

200
00:04:52,521 --> 00:04:52,851
I'll think.

201
00:04:52,851 --> 00:04:53,684
What else?

202
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,130
Oh,

203
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:54,963
uh,

204
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,023
with the coupe.

205
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,950
What was my point about her?

206
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:58,490
Uh,

207
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,170
you were talking about,

208
00:04:59,170 --> 00:04:59,400
uh,

209
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,350
you're a tattoo artist.

210
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:01,280
Had her arm or something.

211
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,980
I saw her arm and one for arms.

212
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:05,420
I think it's a right sleeve.

213
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,320
Yeah.

214
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,600
His style is so distinct.

215
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,040
Did you start check out?

216
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:10,940
Well,

217
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,690
I looked on in California and I
was looking at all these different,

218
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,081
you know,

219
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,880
it's like you,

220
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:17,780
if you,

221
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,120
there's a lot of really
good artists in California,

222
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,940
especially you mean Kat von D
who we've had on the podcast.

223
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:23,610
Oh,

224
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,580
was a great podcast.

225
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:24,920
Yeah,

226
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,820
she was really cool.

227
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,440
There's this,

228
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:26,610
uh,

229
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,341
there's just,

230
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:27,981
there's so many,

231
00:05:27,981 --> 00:05:28,221
like,

232
00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:29,560
I don't even want to name names,

233
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,730
this is a million talented artists,

234
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,610
but when I saw Aaron's work on mine,

235
00:05:34,611 --> 00:05:37,610
especially sleeves and big back pieces,

236
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,820
like his style is really
about big bold like pieces.

237
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:47,330
And when I started talking to him
like immediately we hit it off,

238
00:05:47,331 --> 00:05:47,661
I was like,

239
00:05:47,661 --> 00:05:48,890
this girl is cool as fuck.

240
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:49,760
He's so cool.

241
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,811
Like right away.

242
00:05:50,811 --> 00:05:51,590
Like I was like,

243
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,060
like you know what,

244
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:53,811
you talk to someone,

245
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,380
you really like happy to have
a conversation with them.

246
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,600
And we like on a the perfect level.

247
00:05:58,601 --> 00:05:59,720
Like you really like it,

248
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:00,071
you know,

249
00:06:00,071 --> 00:06:04,270
both of us were talking about all
kinds of different crazy shad and he's,

250
00:06:04,271 --> 00:06:08,680
or he's an honorable person and
he's an artist is like right away.

251
00:06:08,681 --> 00:06:09,110
I was like,

252
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,810
I love this guy.

253
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,451
Know right away.

254
00:06:10,451 --> 00:06:11,430
It's a perfect guy to do it.

255
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,320
What did you guys,

256
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,040
uh,

257
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,580
if,

258
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,331
if you remember,

259
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:15,920
I'm curious to see if you remember.

260
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,810
What did you guys talk about
while he was tattooing you?

261
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,370
Everything and anything,

262
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:19,910
man.

263
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,020
Do you remember any of the conversation?

264
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:21,650
Like is it,

265
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,530
we have it on it,

266
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,383
like a meaningful,

267
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,493
at the beginning.

268
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,850
First Sleeve?

269
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,061
Yeah.

270
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:26,940
At the beginning of the first leak.

271
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:27,250
A lot.

272
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:27,851
It was on video,

273
00:06:27,851 --> 00:06:29,440
but then the second sleeve is like,

274
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,020
like about three years old.

275
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,490
I still have to go back.

276
00:06:33,491 --> 00:06:33,791
I still,

277
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,950
there's a few spots on it.

278
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,521
It's amazing.

279
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,580
Most of it is a memo to Musashi peace.

280
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,060
Who is the guy who is the,

281
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:40,770
Oh,

282
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,120
and there's the graphics joker.

283
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,970
I thought you got rid of
the graphics Cherokee.

284
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:44,561
Yeah.

285
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:45,510
I thought you did too.

286
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,630
I have to suck.

287
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:47,810
It's not quite done yet.

288
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:48,763
I got it.

289
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,180
I think they should pump that out.

290
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:50,990
No,

291
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,500
it's like,

292
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,360
it's not really,

293
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:56,870
even before I knew what a
graphics joke or what you drew it,

294
00:06:56,871 --> 00:06:57,201
right.

295
00:06:57,201 --> 00:06:58,011
Stupid idea.

296
00:06:58,011 --> 00:06:58,221
Yeah.

297
00:06:58,221 --> 00:06:59,054
I drew it.

298
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,103
Yeah.

299
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,690
But I caught that shit.

300
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,120
That's my Jiu Jitsu.

301
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:07,411
But,

302
00:07:07,411 --> 00:07:07,570
uh,

303
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,750
this is Jamison experience.

304
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:09,381
That Tattoo.

305
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:10,214
I did draw a lot.

306
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,960
I drew that in 1990.

307
00:07:13,961 --> 00:07:15,190
It looks like shit now.

308
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,370
I like it.

309
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:16,490
Oh,

310
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,300
the guy who better than water,

311
00:07:18,301 --> 00:07:19,290
if the guy who tattooed

312
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:19,781
for me,

313
00:07:19,781 --> 00:07:21,500
it did a fucking brilliant job,

314
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:23,790
but steam was Danny
Williams and he died of a,

315
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,180
of cancer really?

316
00:07:25,181 --> 00:07:27,400
Reselling and the bottom tattoo.

317
00:07:27,401 --> 00:07:28,211
They're really crazy looking.

318
00:07:28,211 --> 00:07:33,211
Samurai guy that is a meal Molto Musashi
and he's fighting a tiger and that.

319
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:34,720
So what happened?

320
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,760
What happened to you?

321
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:36,700
Sick artwork,

322
00:07:36,701 --> 00:07:37,460
man.

323
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,250
So that's all my man Aaron
Dellavedova his work and he just,

324
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,090
he does brilliant work.

325
00:07:43,091 --> 00:07:43,600
It's,

326
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:43,871
yeah,

327
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,380
the beach.

328
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:44,890
What was the,

329
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,930
what was the term for what

330
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,401
for you?

331
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:48,360
Like where were you,

332
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,660
you went from like one tattoo
and not smoking weed to like,

333
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:52,140
well,

334
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,470
I don't,

335
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,720
maybe I've heard say no

336
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:54,780
was,

337
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,380
um,

338
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,213
I,

339
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,330
I always like,

340
00:07:57,331 --> 00:07:58,200
like tattoos.

341
00:07:58,201 --> 00:07:59,760
I always liked the artwork of it.

342
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,080
I'm a big fan of,

343
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm a big fan of music.

344
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:04,260
I'm a big fan of writing.

345
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:07,680
I'm a big fan of meat movies and cars and,

346
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,391
and,

347
00:08:08,391 --> 00:08:13,260
and paintings and anything that you do
that expresses whatever you have inside

348
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:14,940
of yourself through some medium,

349
00:08:14,941 --> 00:08:19,920
whether it's a medium of making a hot
rod or it's the medium of even designing

350
00:08:19,921 --> 00:08:20,581
clothes.

351
00:08:20,581 --> 00:08:21,414
Like I'm like,

352
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,460
like I'm wearing some
crazy tee shirt right now.

353
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,300
Some dude gave me,

354
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,490
it's a Bruce Lee who's a,

355
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,140
he's acting as a DJ.

356
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,400
I thought that was hilarious.

357
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,080
So,

358
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,811
but it's great.

359
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:31,644
It's funny,

360
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,830
someone's idea that's
expressed through clothes,

361
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:35,461
you know,

362
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:36,910
you can express it through furniture.

363
00:08:36,911 --> 00:08:37,744
I like

364
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,510
my friend away in this table tables,

365
00:08:40,511 --> 00:08:41,344
bad ass.

366
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,190
And

367
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,590
you can express it through anything,

368
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:45,341
but it really,

369
00:08:45,341 --> 00:08:46,330
it's all the same thing.

370
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:47,530
The eye,

371
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:52,530
the idea is that everything that a person
can enjoy is someone else trying to

372
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:57,150
express some sort of positive
through whatever medium it is.

373
00:08:57,151 --> 00:08:58,230
Whether it's a fucking,

374
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:58,611
well,

375
00:08:58,611 --> 00:09:00,000
there's les Miserables,

376
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,730
50 shades of grey.

377
00:09:03,731 --> 00:09:04,810
It's all the same thing.

378
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,030
But what was the turning point?

379
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,020
Do you remember the thing?

380
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:08,963
No,

381
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:13,080
I know I was probably some psychedelic
drug related to experience.

382
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:13,950
Most likely.

383
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:14,580
Yeah.

384
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:14,821
Yeah.

385
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:15,654
That was the the

386
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,760
but what got you there?

387
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,740
Um,

388
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,440
well if marijuana is a gateway drug,

389
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,470
I'm really unfortunately a good example.

390
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,350
I don't think

391
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,730
that it's a negative gateway.

392
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,500
I think we have to get over that idea.

393
00:09:32,501 --> 00:09:35,050
And I think a big part of the
struggle that we have in this country,

394
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:40,150
it's a lot of conservative people
misunderstand the position of people that,

395
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:40,660
uh,

396
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,790
support marijuana or cannabis.

397
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:46,000
And it doesn't mean that they're mutually
exclusive and it doesn't mean that

398
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:47,590
they have to be in combat with each other.

399
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,080
It just means that for whatever reason,

400
00:09:50,081 --> 00:09:51,010
as a society,

401
00:09:51,011 --> 00:09:54,850
we have associated cannabis smokers
and users with lazy bitches.

402
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,103
And that's stupid.

403
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,860
And I think that if I have benefited as a,

404
00:09:59,861 --> 00:10:01,690
an unnecessarily aggro,

405
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,940
you no child of the 80s if
I have benefited from the
magical gift of marijuana,

406
00:10:07,871 --> 00:10:09,910
then I bet you can too.

407
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:14,290
It just needs to be used properly and
it's going to make you examine yourself in

408
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:18,610
a way that may be uncomfortable
but is most likely necessary.

409
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:19,451
You know,

410
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:24,451
and the ideas that we have connected
to any sort of psychedelic experience,

411
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:27,660
marijuana or pay,

412
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,471
Yo the knee,

413
00:10:28,471 --> 00:10:29,111
you name it,

414
00:10:29,111 --> 00:10:33,220
mushrooms automatically people
of a conservative nature.

415
00:10:33,221 --> 00:10:38,080
We'll assume that the people involved
in doing this thing or being lazy or

416
00:10:38,081 --> 00:10:38,980
they're being,

417
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,660
they're being frivolous,

418
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,430
they're being frivolous because they've
decided to like seek escape through

419
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,130
chemicals rather than
deal with the reality.

420
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,860
But if they really knew,

421
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,780
they would know that that's not the case.

422
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,070
If they really had experienced,

423
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:54,701
they would know that.

424
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:55,001
No,

425
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:56,350
it's exact opposite.

426
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:56,631
This,

427
00:10:56,631 --> 00:11:00,260
I hate to fucking bring up this
God damn radio lab show again.

428
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:05,430
They were talking about religious
experiences and people who did acid and,

429
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,020
and they,

430
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,830
and there was uh,

431
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:07,101
there was,

432
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:07,310
uh,

433
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,660
they were talking about
they took these kids,

434
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:11,390
it's too in school.

435
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,870
Took him down to a church setting
where a church sermon was giving,

436
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:15,621
going on.

437
00:11:15,621 --> 00:11:16,850
They're all religious teachers.

438
00:11:16,851 --> 00:11:17,684
Okay.

439
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,950
All religious teachers.

440
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,300
I like religious students.

441
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,010
They all take acid and they hear a sermon,

442
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:22,560
the church,

443
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,450
the beautiful bells.

444
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,320
And they said that nine out of
10 people in the test group,

445
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,610
so there's 2010 have a uh,

446
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,330
uh,

447
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:30,930
uh,

448
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:31,763
a bullshit,

449
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,151
you know,

450
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:32,984
the placebo,

451
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:33,801
10 of the one,

452
00:11:33,801 --> 00:11:33,981
nine,

453
00:11:33,981 --> 00:11:35,930
nine of the 10 had a religious experience.

454
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,520
And they were saying that that
nine out of 10 also went on to,

455
00:11:40,521 --> 00:11:40,940
um,

456
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,260
teach in the ministry,

457
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,850
like nine of the 10 people that took acid.

458
00:11:43,851 --> 00:11:47,150
And they were talking about the concept
of whether or not you could do acid and

459
00:11:47,151 --> 00:11:49,640
whether or not you could create
original religious experience.

460
00:11:49,641 --> 00:11:50,331
And if you could,

461
00:11:50,331 --> 00:11:51,800
why wouldn't you have that all the time?

462
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,070
Well,

463
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,030
I wouldn't ever want to look for,

464
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,830
well what's what we were
talking about earlier,

465
00:11:54,831 --> 00:11:59,510
but like one day maybe we can get our
shitty brains to accept a state of opiate

466
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,470
and Mgma at the same time all the time.

467
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,330
I want like a low grade cocaine.

468
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,981
What's going on?

469
00:12:06,981 --> 00:12:10,460
I mean all respect to people who are
on antidepressants and this is not an

470
00:12:10,461 --> 00:12:11,390
antidepressant rant.

471
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,250
And I think quite honestly,

472
00:12:13,251 --> 00:12:15,290
that there's quite a
few of those rants that,

473
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,280
or they're ignorant.

474
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,120
And even though,

475
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,361
you know,

476
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:17,491
we,

477
00:12:17,491 --> 00:12:17,931
we had,

478
00:12:17,931 --> 00:12:18,320
um,

479
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,310
a conversation with,

480
00:12:19,311 --> 00:12:19,970
um,

481
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,220
Kara Santa Maria who was on [inaudible],

482
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,780
I fucking loved her.

483
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,430
That girl was so fucking,

484
00:12:24,431 --> 00:12:24,760
I've,

485
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,060
I've regurgitated some of
her facts in conversation,

486
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:29,200
not realizing I'm doing it.

487
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,011
I fucking was.

488
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:32,560
So I was afraid to Google her
and see what she looked like.

489
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:32,981
So I was like,

490
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:33,191
what is,

491
00:12:33,191 --> 00:12:35,770
she's not hot because she
was so hot on this podcast.

492
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,671
Just listen to her.

493
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:37,150
You were like,

494
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:37,391
oh,

495
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:38,240
she's beautiful.

496
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,570
More importantly,

497
00:12:40,571 --> 00:12:41,890
she's very fascinating.

498
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:42,161
Very,

499
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:42,461
very,

500
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:42,731
very,

501
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:43,780
really fascinating.

502
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,460
And what was my point?

503
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,370
Uh,

504
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,530
I think psychedelics are
about three of them in a row.

505
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:49,900
Are you taking that off?

506
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,111
Yeah,

507
00:12:50,111 --> 00:12:50,810
next week.

508
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:51,643
I'm taking her home.

509
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,760
He wanted to double date?

510
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,743
Nope.

511
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,970
Trying to can just hinted
rubbing his tickets

512
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:04,490
point was that she was describing
her own personal benefit from,

513
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:04,850
uh,

514
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,640
from using antidepressants
and her own personal,

515
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,150
you know,

516
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,400
her,

517
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,230
her personal benefit from like
regulating her state of consciousness,

518
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,910
but with the use of science.

519
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,440
And if you really stop and think about it,

520
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:16,190
like the,

521
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:19,250
some of the best feelings that
I've ever had have been under the,

522
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:19,521
uh,

523
00:13:19,521 --> 00:13:21,170
under the influence of chemicals.

524
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:21,621
You know,

525
00:13:21,621 --> 00:13:23,420
whether it's right now or whether it's,

526
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,020
you know,

527
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:29,020
the first time I ever did anything which
was an Mtma anything of significance

528
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:29,921
when,

529
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:32,420
when that feeling is so sensational.

530
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,240
Like what would life be if that
feeling existed all the time?

531
00:13:35,241 --> 00:13:39,680
We automatically have this thought in
our head that that cannot be managed and

532
00:13:39,681 --> 00:13:44,681
that needs to be discarded right away
immediately for the state of consciousness

533
00:13:44,721 --> 00:13:46,580
that exist right now
can never be elevated.

534
00:13:46,581 --> 00:13:47,414
This is what it is,

535
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,800
but I don't know even know that's true.

536
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,650
I Aye.

537
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:49,940
Aye.

538
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,060
I wonder sometimes because I go like,

539
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:53,440
okay,

540
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:53,560
I,

541
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,390
I feel like I spend my day chasing,

542
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,010
chasing a buzz where it's like,

543
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,300
like coffee in the morning and then
there's just like dead period in the

544
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:01,310
afternoon.

545
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:01,631
I'm like,

546
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:01,930
well,

547
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:02,970
before the beer cart,

548
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,480
when you feel it's respectable
to start drinking at five,

549
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,860
5:00 PM 5:00 PM

550
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:10,931
5:00 PM,

551
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:11,321
they can say,

552
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:12,100
leave me alone.

553
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:12,851
Oh God,

554
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:13,684
dad work.

555
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,460
Who keeps the fucking lights on.

556
00:14:15,461 --> 00:14:19,660
Some of the best moments of my
life are when my wife had a job.

557
00:14:19,661 --> 00:14:20,400
We were living in a,

558
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,760
in an apartment complex.

559
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,210
We had a nanny only because I was on
the road and sometimes the nanny and I

560
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:26,920
would overlap and I'd be
there when she would be there.

561
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,660
The best feelings my kids are,

562
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:30,880
they're sunsetting in Hollywood.

563
00:14:30,881 --> 00:14:32,850
My wife fucking end up in
the door and just go and do,

564
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:34,060
they won't open a bottle of wine.

565
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,940
Oh motherfucker.

566
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:40,690
I remember getting like chills like
it's Christmas Eve and we crack open a

567
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:42,220
bottle of wine pouring for the nanny.

568
00:14:42,221 --> 00:14:43,450
We just sit on the couch.

569
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:44,284
It's socks.

570
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,130
Fuck love.

571
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,820
I love those kind of moments.

572
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,540
You love leg ultimate moments
where everybody agrees.

573
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,100
Yes,

574
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,710
it's time.

575
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,850
Everyone's on the same page.

576
00:14:55,851 --> 00:14:57,890
I think that's one of
the back open the bottle.

577
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,790
Everybody agrees.

578
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,081
It's great.

579
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:02,450
Like that's why you like sort
of the ultimate party meister.

580
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,030
It's like you're the guy
that would get everybody.

581
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:05,270
Ah,

582
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:05,720
fuck it.

583
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,560
Bert was do chef,

584
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,290
let's do shop,

585
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,180
but we do it a shot.

586
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:09,500
Give me a hug.

587
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:09,981
You fucks.

588
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:11,690
I love Ya and everybody
would get together.

589
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:12,561
I think.

590
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:12,831
Yeah,

591
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:13,940
I love that feeling.

592
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:14,261
And when,

593
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:17,780
when like it's like just
fucking someone just goes,

594
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,270
uh,

595
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:22,930
I go was going to be awkward if I order
a beer and some would be like if you get

596
00:15:22,931 --> 00:15:23,411
one I'll get one.

597
00:15:23,411 --> 00:15:23,621
I'm like,

598
00:15:23,621 --> 00:15:24,454
we're fucking

599
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,410
right away.

600
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,250
Can love that feeling.

601
00:15:27,251 --> 00:15:30,340
I think that's what the feeling people
get when they connect when they smoked

602
00:15:30,341 --> 00:15:32,490
marijuana is that someone
likes it and then they're like,

603
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,190
Nah.

604
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:33,450
They're like,

605
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:33,630
oh,

606
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,520
okay.

607
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,070
It's such a great,

608
00:15:36,071 --> 00:15:40,090
like there's definitely a thing that
comes with being like in that sort of

609
00:15:40,091 --> 00:15:41,960
fraternity of people that know,

610
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,133
you know,

611
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:43,661
then no,

612
00:15:43,661 --> 00:15:44,560
you'd smoked pot.

613
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,281
Everybody's in.

614
00:15:45,281 --> 00:15:45,640
It's like,

615
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,020
oh we're all cool and it was right.

616
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:53,350
As much as you sort of accepts
that traditional notion of reality.

617
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,480
Like if you've never gotten high,

618
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,430
you and I have very little to talk about.

619
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,950
I mean we can talk about
a few things for certain.

620
00:16:02,951 --> 00:16:07,870
We can talk about facts and
Statistics and history and numbers.

621
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,820
We can talk a lot about a lot of things,

622
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,580
but we can't talk about
what the fuck is going on.

623
00:16:12,581 --> 00:16:15,610
When you think about someone and
then the phone rings and it's them,

624
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:20,720
you can't talk about that because
you're going to give me some scaredy cat

625
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,560
answer.

626
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,393
You're going to go well,

627
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,730
it was just sort of a coincidence,

628
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,780
no relationship whatsoever.

629
00:16:27,781 --> 00:16:31,480
There's never been a statistical
correlation between you
think the mount someone

630
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,140
and then them calling you and not
meaning anything significant whatsoever.

631
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,790
It's just nonsense.

632
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:42,070
I need you to get a rip and put a tie
on where some shiny shoes with slippery

633
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:45,460
souls and walked down the
street like a gentleman.

634
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,071
I don't know.

635
00:16:48,071 --> 00:16:49,290
But I know that when I,

636
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,830
a little light bulb goes off in my head
and I think about Bert Kreischer and

637
00:16:53,831 --> 00:16:58,831
then I looked down at my phone and it
starts ringing immediately and it's Bert

638
00:16:59,170 --> 00:16:59,410
Kreischer,

639
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,140
well call me crazy,

640
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,090
but I think something's up.

641
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,381
Okay.

642
00:17:05,381 --> 00:17:10,381
I think there's something fucking going
on when I think about you and then all

643
00:17:10,451 --> 00:17:12,970
of a sudden you call me immediately.

644
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,260
It happens every day nonstop,

645
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,473
a lot.

646
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:17,900
And you know when it happens,

647
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:19,700
you ready for this Brian Red Ban.

648
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,953
It happens

649
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,880
live in your life correctly.

650
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,040
When you live in your life correctly,

651
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:29,870
the universe gives you a lot
of fucking secret messages.

652
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,023
That's what it is.

653
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,450
I like yesterday,

654
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,410
this is something crazy.

655
00:17:35,411 --> 00:17:36,101
As an example,

656
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:39,310
yesterday I was talking to my
friend who's a ginger and I'm like,

657
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,420
is there such things as Jewish ginger's
I've never even heard is like I've never

658
00:17:43,421 --> 00:17:44,830
seen a Jewish ginger before.

659
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,250
She was like,

660
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,530
of course there is and then like two
hours later it's somebody else just is

661
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:49,810
like,

662
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:49,961
oh,

663
00:17:49,961 --> 00:17:50,621
this guy,

664
00:17:50,621 --> 00:17:51,850
he's a gr ginger.

665
00:17:51,851 --> 00:17:53,020
He's a Jewish gender.

666
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:53,920
Have you ever seen one of them?

667
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:54,640
I'm like,

668
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:54,941
all right,

669
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:58,750
I've never talked about ginger Jewish
ginger's my whole entire life now twice in

670
00:17:58,751 --> 00:17:59,170
one day

671
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,540
there's a possibility
that you attracted down.

672
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:05,890
There's a possibility that much like
you ever sent an email on Google,

673
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,780
you know it could be about anything.

674
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,640
You can just like send an email and say,

675
00:18:09,641 --> 00:18:10,331
hey man,

676
00:18:10,331 --> 00:18:15,331
I'm looking to get a life size copy
of the robot from lost in space

677
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,280
base and then you look in the corner
of your Gmail when you get on.

678
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:20,551
I ended up,

679
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:22,320
y'all lost in space shit.

680
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,233
That's reading.

681
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:23,940
Right,

682
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,420
right,

683
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:24,840
right.

684
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,671
Exactly.

685
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,890
So you think somebody
is reading my presently,

686
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,290
this is my point.

687
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:36,470
If reality is a simulation wouldn't have
followed the same principles that your

688
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,790
genes or your Yahoo has,

689
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,100
where you'll see the corners where shit,

690
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,540
you've sent emails about,

691
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,990
we'll be reoccurring themes in your
life and do that in life all the time.

692
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:46,980
I've put it out there,

693
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,090
but isn't it fascinating
it out there is it mirrors.

694
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,250
It mirrors what we know is a program.

695
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:53,821
Oh,

696
00:18:53,821 --> 00:18:54,660
that's fucked up.

697
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:55,290
It's true.

698
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:55,950
You're right.

699
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,430
Yeah.

700
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:00,090
It's just the fucking natural course of
history of how life's going to go down.

701
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,350
It already happens in life.

702
00:19:01,351 --> 00:19:02,190
God does it well.

703
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:03,001
The universe does.

704
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:04,530
It trickles on to you.

705
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,090
You sound like you're right for a cult.

706
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,820
I could fucking gate you just
shut up and write something.

707
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,540
Give me some Blue Nike Suck my Dick
and a house full of feathers I could be

708
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,163
called.

709
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,510
I've been watching this

710
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:21,650
documentary on the vice guys and made
a documentary about this fucking dude

711
00:19:21,651 --> 00:19:22,484
who's a,

712
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,290
he's the new Jesus.

713
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,850
He's a Siberian Jesus.

714
00:19:25,851 --> 00:19:26,790
Have you seen that Brian?

715
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,101
Listen,

716
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:28,934
ladies and gentlemen,

717
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:29,863
pull it up.

718
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,080
No,

719
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,830
we shouldn't pull it up because
it's a really long piece.

720
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,490
You guys are crazy.

721
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,820
I've only watched the
first two 10 minute pieces,

722
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:40,200
but it's fascinating.

723
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,830
There's a guy in Siberia that's created
a village and he's like the second

724
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:44,664
coming of Jesus.

725
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,840
He's like the new Jesus,

726
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,360
and he has thousands of people
that they're living up there.

727
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,583
Thousands.

728
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,371
They're all living up there.

729
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:51,240
But meanwhile,

730
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,220
they're living in an unbelievably,

731
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,020
unbelievably beautiful place.

732
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:55,261
I mean,

733
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:56,460
it is stunning.

734
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,250
If maybe maybe seeding
if find some photos,

735
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,180
but it's,

736
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,680
it's staggeringly beautiful.

737
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:02,580
And this guy,

738
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,670
he's not p appreciate anything
bad except being a Vegan.

739
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:06,510
That's silly.

740
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,010
But

741
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:07,730
I can't think of it.

742
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,860
I got to have for me Vegan fucking,

743
00:20:09,861 --> 00:20:11,210
even when I was doing that clean program,

744
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,044
Jesus,

745
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,540
I'd have a chicken with
fucking lettuce wraps.

746
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,740
Oh,

747
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,130
I love spicy shit.

748
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:17,731
Yeah.

749
00:20:17,731 --> 00:20:19,750
I wish that animals weren't
so fucking delicious.

750
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:23,430
It's the fucking amazing and I wish
that they didn't fucking keep making

751
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:24,264
animals.

752
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,170
Maybe they would just all live
forever and everyone will be a mortal.

753
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,220
We have enough numbers now
and just keep it going.

754
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,300
I had duck heartland who?

755
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,900
The photo of the dude.

756
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:34,340
Who's the,

757
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,520
the Russian Jesus.

758
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,571
Meanwhile,

759
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:37,404
he's got an awesome,

760
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,390
I don't think I ever saw Jesus smile.

761
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,591
He does.

762
00:20:40,591 --> 00:20:40,741
What?

763
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:41,574
Green Day's plans.

764
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:45,010
Sad cause he's hurt the [inaudible] Jesus.

765
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,360
His pictures were like
hip hop cover albums.

766
00:20:47,361 --> 00:20:48,230
I just was up

767
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:49,421
the Australian,

768
00:20:49,421 --> 00:20:52,200
Jesus is a guy in
Queensland and he says he's

769
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:52,780
Jesus.

770
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,180
It was just in Queensland.

771
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,420
What's accurate level you doing?

772
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:56,791
What are you doing?

773
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:57,240
Stand up.

774
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:57,410
No,

775
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:00,630
he did a triplet and
Australia in Queensland.

776
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,490
Australia.

777
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,520
A country I've ever been to.

778
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,600
I'm telling you what to
say this and I don't,

779
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:07,110
I'm not shitting on America and
I'm not shitting on Kanuka Candida.

780
00:21:07,111 --> 00:21:07,921
Can you guys are second.

781
00:21:07,921 --> 00:21:09,510
But Australia blows everyone.

782
00:21:09,511 --> 00:21:09,880
Yeah.

783
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,570
I love,

784
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,460
I love the people there.

785
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,600
I love their attitude.

786
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,220
It's like we,

787
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,150
we are so uptightness country,

788
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:17,431
we're,

789
00:21:17,431 --> 00:21:19,570
we're really so unbelievably uptight,

790
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,320
especially when it comes to like
going out and having fun and relaxed.

791
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,060
I'd moved to Australia in a
fucking heartbeat in a heartbeat.

792
00:21:25,061 --> 00:21:29,200
It's like there's this thing about America
that America was sort of founded and

793
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:33,190
created by a bunch of people that have
come here from somewhere that sucked and

794
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:37,360
they had enough and they just
made it over to some new spot.

795
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,870
But I think that the,

796
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:41,440
the,

797
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,440
the type of person that it takes to be
able to get in a boat and travel across

798
00:21:47,231 --> 00:21:49,900
the ocean and land line
is finding the land.

799
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,490
I think it takes several

800
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:54,010
generations before
everybody fucking relaxes.

801
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,810
That's the bad ass motherfuckers that
could get a boat had fucking do that

802
00:21:58,930 --> 00:21:59,980
because you just shook the,

803
00:21:59,981 --> 00:22:00,280
the,

804
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:00,701
the,

805
00:22:00,701 --> 00:22:01,371
the loose leaf.

806
00:22:01,371 --> 00:22:02,530
Scott shaking off the tree.

807
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,211
There were,

808
00:22:03,211 --> 00:22:04,200
there was so gangster,

809
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,480
they gotten a goddamn
boat and traveled across.

810
00:22:06,481 --> 00:22:08,110
You ever do that ends with no radio,

811
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:08,210
right?

812
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,290
Do you ever think about that though?

813
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:11,570
When you travel with your kids
somewhere and then you go,

814
00:22:11,571 --> 00:22:13,220
how would we travel across America?

815
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:13,671
Like,

816
00:22:13,671 --> 00:22:14,030
how would,

817
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:19,030
how would your family size up in a
wagon train going from New York to La?

818
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,650
My family would have either stayed,

819
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:21,910
I mean if you had little children,

820
00:22:21,911 --> 00:22:23,770
you did stayed in Italy or Ireland,

821
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,990
you would have done whatever you
could do to stay where you were.

822
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:26,810
But my,

823
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:27,090
uh,

824
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,730
Grandfather's family came over here and

825
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,270
I want to say the early 19 hundreds my
grandfather's family came over from Italy

826
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:39,420
and my grandfather lived
on a farm and he said,

827
00:22:39,421 --> 00:22:42,180
tell me stories about how they used
to kill rabbits with their hand,

828
00:22:42,181 --> 00:22:43,160
like grandmother neck.

829
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:43,994
It's snapped them.

830
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,720
That was like a normal part of your life.

831
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:46,531
And there was,

832
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:46,831
you know,

833
00:22:46,831 --> 00:22:49,170
winters where like they
would run out of the food.

834
00:22:49,171 --> 00:22:50,200
Like there was no food.

835
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,040
They didn't have to go and borrow
food from people that were neighbors.

836
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,400
Crazy times crazy.

837
00:22:55,401 --> 00:22:55,611
I know.

838
00:22:55,611 --> 00:22:56,180
It's crazy.

839
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,430
More crazy is like,

840
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,001
can I say this?

841
00:22:59,001 --> 00:23:00,140
I said this guessing Lee,

842
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,840
but like the amount of humility
your grandfather must have had,

843
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,400
he was a very humble guy.

844
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,450
You like to come here?

845
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:06,610
Oh,

846
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:06,890
you know,

847
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:07,190
I,

848
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:11,420
he got walked on by my grandmother and
my grandmother was like a really strong

849
00:23:11,421 --> 00:23:12,770
woman and she used to
yell at them all right.

850
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,360
I was like a little kid because
my mom had me when she was 20.

851
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,291
And you know,

852
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:18,280
my mom did her best,

853
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:19,330
but she was really young.

854
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:19,720
You know,

855
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,060
when you're 20 years old and all
of sudden you're raising a baby,

856
00:23:22,061 --> 00:23:27,020
that's a [inaudible] was 21
when I was born or where my,

857
00:23:27,021 --> 00:23:27,430
um,

858
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,360
my mother was 21 rather when I was there,

859
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,150
I was 21 when I was born.

860
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:31,931
I might as well,

861
00:23:31,931 --> 00:23:32,950
Ben and I would probably feel like,

862
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,491
oh my God,

863
00:23:33,491 --> 00:23:34,480
this bitch is 21.

864
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:35,950
She doesn't know what
the fuck is going on.

865
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,133
I got to get up to

866
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,930
mentality immediately.

867
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:40,590
No,

868
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,850
they're all 40.

869
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:42,870
They could have been,

870
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,111
no,

871
00:23:43,111 --> 00:23:43,261
no.

872
00:23:43,261 --> 00:23:44,071
At the time you were born,

873
00:23:44,071 --> 00:23:44,730
I don't know.

874
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:45,321
I don't know old.

875
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:45,840
They were,

876
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,673
I mean

877
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,040
me to wrap my head around now
I don't want to do the math,

878
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,270
but the point was my,

879
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:50,841
you know,

880
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:52,940
my mother was young and so like

881
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,850
growing up with like,

882
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:55,160
uh,

883
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,810
uh,

884
00:23:55,810 --> 00:24:00,640
a young mother that doesn't necessarily
know what the fuck is going on

885
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,020
really makes you realize
at a young age like,

886
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,130
oh shit,

887
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:04,830
okay,

888
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,471
this isn't based,

889
00:24:05,471 --> 00:24:07,400
you start looking at everything
a little differently.

890
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,800
He doesn't know what's going on.

891
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,530
I don't think she can make no,

892
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:14,610
she was okay with that,

893
00:24:14,611 --> 00:24:15,360
but

894
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,240
both in his fucking crazy thing together,

895
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:17,830
shit.

896
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,311
And you know,

897
00:24:18,311 --> 00:24:19,600
you realize like kind of early

898
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,003
the fuck.

899
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:22,570
That's crazy.

900
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,070
I can't imagine being,

901
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:28,240
I can't imagine that my biggest hiccup
in life was getting into standup because

902
00:24:28,241 --> 00:24:29,020
by my,

903
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,020
I just that,

904
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,330
that I didn't,

905
00:24:31,331 --> 00:24:35,260
I didn't have any humility at that time
of my life and my dad gave me a speech

906
00:24:35,261 --> 00:24:38,440
on my 26th birthday that
was like fucking aggressive,

907
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,010
like really like the 20 seconds,

908
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,410
the 20s.

909
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:42,430
It was on my birthday.

910
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,520
He called me and I thought he's
going to wish me happy birthday.

911
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,511
And he was like,

912
00:24:46,511 --> 00:24:47,590
you're a fucking loser.

913
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,410
Oh my.

914
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:48,671
He's like,

915
00:24:48,671 --> 00:24:49,840
you make me embarrassed.

916
00:24:49,841 --> 00:24:50,560
I'm embarrassing her,

917
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,130
my son,

918
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,210
I lie about you.

919
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:52,840
Oh my God,

920
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,070
he's,

921
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,520
do you know what that's
like to love private,

922
00:24:54,521 --> 00:24:55,291
to have a judge said,

923
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:56,290
I heard your son,

924
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,430
God is life's operating by raw Oliver
stone and he's in New York turned

925
00:24:59,460 --> 00:24:59,680
standard.

926
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,370
How's he doing?

927
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,110
Cause I lied in fucking court.

928
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:02,400
He goes,

929
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,520
that makes me sick to my stomach.

930
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,181
I was like,

931
00:25:04,181 --> 00:25:04,901
what can I do different?

932
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:05,200
And he goes,

933
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,033
nothing.

934
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,533
I was like,

935
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:07,900
well,

936
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,651
can I fix this?

937
00:25:08,651 --> 00:25:08,951
And he goes,

938
00:25:08,951 --> 00:25:10,330
I know I failed you as a father.

939
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,830
And I know it.

940
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,030
It got me to like,

941
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,140
it changed my life.

942
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:14,980
Like I went,

943
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:19,980
he taught me how to get taught me how
to be humble enough to get a job in

944
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,990
standup because I,

945
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,120
you just needed to work the door.

946
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:23,230
But I thought I was above that.

947
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:24,670
I thought that I was better than that.

948
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,280
Like I thought that someone would just
grab me and put me on stage and I'd be

949
00:25:27,281 --> 00:25:27,880
discovered.

950
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,960
That's how I thought it happened.

951
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:29,201
I didn't know.

952
00:25:29,201 --> 00:25:31,960
You could literally be humble and say,

953
00:25:31,961 --> 00:25:32,771
I want to do this.

954
00:25:32,771 --> 00:25:33,850
How do I go about doing this?

955
00:25:33,851 --> 00:25:35,530
Please help me test someone.

956
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:41,190
And he got me into it and
literally fucking started
doing it the next night and

957
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,990
six months later I had
a deal and it was like,

958
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,400
it was a fucking,

959
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,170
one of the greatest things I ever did.

960
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,430
I look back at that so fondly.

961
00:25:48,431 --> 00:25:50,800
Those times me like I outside,

962
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:52,210
this is every single
night hanging outside.

963
00:25:52,211 --> 00:25:52,730
Jim Norton,

964
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,351
Bobby Kelly,

965
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:54,340
Patrice O'neil,

966
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,590
Colin like not Colloquia.

967
00:25:55,591 --> 00:25:56,320
And actually he didn't,

968
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:56,950
I didn't,

969
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,540
I've never actually
met him until recently.

970
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,470
Just throw him in there.

971
00:25:59,560 --> 00:25:59,881
Cause I,

972
00:25:59,881 --> 00:26:01,880
I started getting into
a tough crowd mentality.

973
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,980
I started living off the
credits of tough crowd.

974
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:04,890
I was like me,

975
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:05,723
Bobby Kelly.

976
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,700
I'm honest.

977
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,171
I'd never,

978
00:26:09,171 --> 00:26:10,080
I'd never met Nikki there.

979
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,310
So No,

980
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,253
I mean I've seen them come,

981
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,830
I worked the door when
he'd come in and do the

982
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:14,390
club,

983
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,300
but I never knew.

984
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,530
You see him on stage.

985
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:20,240
It's fucking next brotherly love make
us Nick Dipaolo to me is one of the most

986
00:26:20,241 --> 00:26:22,040
underrated comedians in
this kind of hands down.

987
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:22,671
No questions asked.

988
00:26:22,671 --> 00:26:23,151
He's Kinda guy.

989
00:26:23,151 --> 00:26:26,290
You can tell his jokes to your friend at
a bar and they fucking lose their mind.

990
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,150
He had a joke about her.

991
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,820
You remember when Katrina hit do?

992
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,200
It's so cruel.

993
00:26:32,201 --> 00:26:32,711
It was so,

994
00:26:32,711 --> 00:26:33,820
it was so fucked up.

995
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:34,720
But he goes,

996
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:34,880
yeah,

997
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,350
they were.

998
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,610
They were writing rescue,

999
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,690
rescue,

1000
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:38,950
rescue signs on the row,

1001
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:39,701
on the roof.

1002
00:26:39,701 --> 00:26:41,530
But I'm not doing this any Josh.

1003
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,710
I'm so sorry Ben.

1004
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,801
And I was like,

1005
00:26:44,801 --> 00:26:45,850
there's no way I'll get through it.

1006
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,530
There was signing a rescue,

1007
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,100
uh,

1008
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:48,431
you know,

1009
00:26:48,431 --> 00:26:49,270
signs on the roof,

1010
00:26:49,271 --> 00:26:51,830
but there were misses
Belvin him instead of help,

1011
00:26:51,831 --> 00:26:53,590
but said Hap and once,

1012
00:26:53,591 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm happy to trick that fucking water

1013
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,920
if you want some hap drink that water.

1014
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,230
Nick Depaulo I'm not,

1015
00:27:02,231 --> 00:27:02,981
I'm sorry nick.

1016
00:27:02,981 --> 00:27:04,010
I butchered your joke.

1017
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:04,670
Apologize.

1018
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,980
I wish I knew his joke about he goes,

1019
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:07,883
ah,

1020
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,540
I'm not going to do this.

1021
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:10,400
Ain't justice either.

1022
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,950
They a lot of bills and they
haven't said the n word.

1023
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,360
A lot of people say that rarely.

1024
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,870
I guess you'd never put
$1,000 on a playoff game that

1025
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,390
I know I ruined that bit,

1026
00:27:20,391 --> 00:27:20,931
but no,

1027
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:21,161
no,

1028
00:27:21,161 --> 00:27:21,431
no,

1029
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,264
no.

1030
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,590
Nick Depaulo was,

1031
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
is one of the funniest.

1032
00:27:24,801 --> 00:27:25,730
I watched naughty,

1033
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:26,480
naughty,

1034
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,290
naughty,

1035
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,123
naughty and

1036
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,030
I watched it.

1037
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,490
Nordion rd and nick on uh,

1038
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:38,120
on on the fucking same thing.

1039
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,390
Damn.

1040
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:42,670
Package shows on I want watch it cause I
respect both of those guys so much that

1041
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:43,543
I go,

1042
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,150
it's not the best shows sometimes.

1043
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:50,170
Well this is what I think that show would
be fucking magic if it was uncensored

1044
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:55,930
and to take nick and rd and putting on
my regular like taking Joey d as in make

1045
00:27:56,711 --> 00:27:57,920
him instead of talk.

1046
00:27:57,921 --> 00:27:58,940
Write with a Crayon.

1047
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,360
Yeah,

1048
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,350
it's nonsense.

1049
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,520
It's fucking stupid.

1050
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:04,040
I watched it all the time though
cause it's like I love nick and Arnie.

1051
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:05,480
Someone with some fucking balls.

1052
00:28:05,481 --> 00:28:06,740
Please take that chair.

1053
00:28:06,741 --> 00:28:07,610
I'll put it on the Internet.

1054
00:28:07,611 --> 00:28:10,820
You'd make more money then they'll be
more people that budgeting and you could

1055
00:28:10,821 --> 00:28:13,910
still put it on direct TV or whatever
the fuck you're putting it on.

1056
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,013
It's still would be,

1057
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:15,980
but leave.

1058
00:28:15,981 --> 00:28:17,270
Let Nick Be Nick.

1059
00:28:17,271 --> 00:28:19,730
Let RDB already let him be crazy.

1060
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,833
Let him,

1061
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,890
let him talk completely unhindered

1062
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:26,090
the way he,

1063
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,620
what did I,

1064
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,251
we were talking,

1065
00:28:28,251 --> 00:28:33,251
I was talking to someone recently about
bottom lines and bottom line I go to

1066
00:28:33,301 --> 00:28:33,580
when you,

1067
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,290
when you're doing bad in the hecklers
attacking you and you have your comeback

1068
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,750
and Nick Depaulo has a time,

1069
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:43,070
I once again a butchering whatever this
story is because I don't remember it,

1070
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,860
but nick said that he was getting
heckled by this girl and uh,

1071
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:50,180
it was her bachelorette party and he was
on the road and some podunk town and he

1072
00:28:50,181 --> 00:28:51,014
was like,

1073
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,441
he was like,

1074
00:28:51,441 --> 00:28:52,274
ma'am,

1075
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:55,580
I hope the next time you reach
under your armpit you feel a lump.

1076
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,391
And he goes,

1077
00:28:58,391 --> 00:29:00,940
I've never had an entire
crowd hate me more.

1078
00:29:00,941 --> 00:29:03,950
And they had to escort
him to the green room,

1079
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,280
but he's a fucking liar.

1080
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,450
Old School,

1081
00:29:07,451 --> 00:29:08,830
like old school,

1082
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:09,580
kind of like,

1083
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,610
that's the kind of dad I want
Amit dads at like my kid's school.

1084
00:29:12,611 --> 00:29:14,170
And I wonder if they
knew who the fuck I am.

1085
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,840
Like then they,

1086
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,970
then they do know who I am.

1087
00:29:15,971 --> 00:29:16,960
They figured out who I am,

1088
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,250
they'll Google me and they'll go,

1089
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:18,911
oh shit,

1090
00:29:18,911 --> 00:29:19,421
I knew you were.

1091
00:29:19,421 --> 00:29:20,950
This guy can be this guy around you.

1092
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,063
Like I wonder,

1093
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,890
I wonder if like parents,

1094
00:29:23,891 --> 00:29:24,760
cause he's got kids.

1095
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:29,440
If they meet him and they have no clue
of who he is and then like Google him and

1096
00:29:29,441 --> 00:29:29,890
then they're like,

1097
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:30,371
oh my God,

1098
00:29:30,371 --> 00:29:31,690
I can tell this joke in front of you.

1099
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,750
He's one of the funniest
fucking human beings,

1100
00:29:34,751 --> 00:29:34,990
man.

1101
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:35,661
I really,

1102
00:29:35,661 --> 00:29:36,440
very nice guy.

1103
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,273
Do you ever do tough crowd?

1104
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,420
Tough crowd was a
definitive show on my life.

1105
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,110
Yeah.

1106
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,210
I would just have my first daughter show.

1107
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,470
I've been doing the road and I would,

1108
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,300
and I knew a lot of those guys.

1109
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,290
Most of those guys from doing
standard strategy that shows canceled.

1110
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,183
It's so silly.

1111
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:51,671
Bullshit.

1112
00:29:51,671 --> 00:29:53,610
Seems like like why would you ever,

1113
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,520
I mean it's such an easy resource.

1114
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,090
The,

1115
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:56,390
you know,

1116
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,620
it was easy to get comedians.

1117
00:29:57,621 --> 00:29:58,880
Everybody wanted to be on it.

1118
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,110
It was very entertaining.

1119
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,100
We'll get to talking to him
like it's pretty much a podcast.

1120
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:04,490
Yeah,

1121
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:05,323
it wasn't fun.

1122
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,830
It was a limited

1123
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,000
like time,

1124
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,410
a time limited podcast.

1125
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,040
This,

1126
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:10,700
listen man,

1127
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:15,700
we're so lucky that we are existing in
this time where you can do this thing

1128
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,170
where you could do
whatever the fuck you want.

1129
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,640
No one's telling us what to do.

1130
00:30:19,641 --> 00:30:20,480
We're doing whenever we want.

1131
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:21,650
We decided to keep going.

1132
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,240
We decided to end the podcast,

1133
00:30:23,241 --> 00:30:24,320
take a leak and keep going.

1134
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,030
There's no producers is don't.

1135
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,540
That's the beauty of a situation.

1136
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:29,941
Oh,

1137
00:30:29,941 --> 00:30:34,410
this is when Greg Giraldo and
Denis leary hit pause for a second.

1138
00:30:34,411 --> 00:30:35,070
Brian,

1139
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:35,960
this is a funny,

1140
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:39,780
or keep it all your money story because
Geraldo never even went to the nuclear

1141
00:30:39,781 --> 00:30:40,350
weapons,

1142
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,410
which is plagiarism.

1143
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,510
He never went to that.

1144
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,370
He never even went to that.

1145
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,800
But Larry was so conti with them.

1146
00:30:46,801 --> 00:30:48,180
Like right off the bat.

1147
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:51,540
Greg Giraldo was a buck
and beautiful dude.

1148
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,780
He was just the nicest fucking guy.

1149
00:30:54,781 --> 00:30:56,400
He was very intelligent in a,

1150
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:59,490
in a time where in my life when
no one needed to be nice to me.

1151
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:02,400
There were two people that
were distinctly nice to me and,

1152
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:02,721
and,

1153
00:31:02,721 --> 00:31:05,850
and gentle and that was
bill burr and Greg Geraldo.

1154
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:06,361
Like,

1155
00:31:06,361 --> 00:31:06,571
you know,

1156
00:31:06,571 --> 00:31:07,080
Norton and,

1157
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,211
and,

1158
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:08,940
and Bobby and all those
guys were always nice to me.

1159
00:31:08,941 --> 00:31:09,740
But man,

1160
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,210
good Geraldo and Bill Berg took time,

1161
00:31:12,211 --> 00:31:13,350
pulled me aside and like,

1162
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,700
they were fucking great guys.

1163
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,580
I remember one time calling
in to my buddy cowhead show,

1164
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,180
uh,

1165
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:18,690
and,

1166
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:22,920
and cause Geraldo was on and calling in
to listen to Geraldo's interview cause I

1167
00:31:22,921 --> 00:31:23,970
just love Greg.

1168
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,550
And I had told him and drag goes,

1169
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,630
I'll put them on the
phone and talk to him.

1170
00:31:27,631 --> 00:31:31,890
And I talked to Greg for like fucking 10
minutes in between the break in a song

1171
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,761
and just was like,

1172
00:31:32,761 --> 00:31:32,941
man,

1173
00:31:32,941 --> 00:31:33,150
how,

1174
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,050
how's everything going?

1175
00:31:34,051 --> 00:31:34,381
And he was like,

1176
00:31:34,381 --> 00:31:34,870
well,

1177
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:35,070
yeah,

1178
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,090
he was very sincere.

1179
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,680
Fucking fucking great guy.

1180
00:31:37,681 --> 00:31:38,790
He had a show,

1181
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,680
I don't remember what network it was on,

1182
00:31:40,681 --> 00:31:41,131
but it was,

1183
00:31:41,131 --> 00:31:41,640
uh,

1184
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,680
it was his sitcom.

1185
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,120
It was on during when yours was right.

1186
00:31:45,121 --> 00:31:45,461
Yeah.

1187
00:31:45,461 --> 00:31:45,720
Yeah.

1188
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,750
He talked about partying with
the girl that was on your show.

1189
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,570
Which one?

1190
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:49,830
Uh,

1191
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,600
the girl with the big tits.

1192
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,750
Who on newsradio girls are they tense?

1193
00:31:54,751 --> 00:31:56,070
Did Not one girl with big tits.

1194
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:56,840
No.

1195
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,330
No.

1196
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,460
Who was the girl and
there was beautiful girls,

1197
00:31:59,461 --> 00:32:00,600
but then I always

1198
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,083
have they,

1199
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,470
I thought her tits were so
big they had to tape them on.

1200
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,240
Maura was the white girl with black hair.

1201
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:09,451
Yeah,

1202
00:32:09,451 --> 00:32:10,200
she was though.

1203
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,370
That's a really,

1204
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,580
that's a terrible misunderstanding.

1205
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,713
She was beautiful.

1206
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,200
She was very beautiful
and incredibly town home.

1207
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,010
Fucking one incredibly town
with white wine with her.

1208
00:32:20,011 --> 00:32:20,844
So bad.

1209
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:22,190
I did a scene with her once,

1210
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:25,640
I'll never forget this and I told her
and she just sort of laughed it off

1211
00:32:25,641 --> 00:32:26,474
because she's,

1212
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,370
she's like really?

1213
00:32:28,371 --> 00:32:30,230
Like she wasn't,

1214
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:33,890
she would never like
brag about her talent,

1215
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,890
like as an actor.

1216
00:32:34,891 --> 00:32:35,724
And he was good,

1217
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,120
but we did a scene together and um,

1218
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,370
I didn't that she was acting,

1219
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,280
I thought she was saying
something to me and I was like,

1220
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:43,521
oh,

1221
00:32:43,521 --> 00:32:44,270
that's the words.

1222
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:44,421
Oh,

1223
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:45,530
well I go,

1224
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:46,101
Holy Shit.

1225
00:32:46,101 --> 00:32:47,090
You bad ass bitch.

1226
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:47,960
I go,

1227
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,280
I didn't know you were acting.

1228
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:49,591
I go,

1229
00:32:49,591 --> 00:32:51,230
you just fucking rocked me.

1230
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:55,220
Like she rocked me with what she was
saying because the set of news radio was

1231
00:32:55,221 --> 00:32:56,150
very loose.

1232
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,860
There was a lot of fucking off.

1233
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:02,030
And there was also a lot of improvisation
where it's like Dave Foley was

1234
00:33:02,031 --> 00:33:05,810
responsible for a huge amount
of like what got on the air,

1235
00:33:05,811 --> 00:33:06,231
that show,

1236
00:33:06,231 --> 00:33:07,220
because it's sort of like,

1237
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,560
he was like sort of like a
almost like a secret producer.

1238
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:13,100
And it was because the guys who wrote
the show where like they were so open

1239
00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:15,950
minded and so smart and Paul Simms,

1240
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,690
who is the executive producer was just,

1241
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:22,190
it's really brilliant guy who recognized
that there was a lot of people like AMD

1242
00:33:22,191 --> 00:33:27,191
or like Phil Hartman or Dave Foley or
whatever who would have this in intuition

1243
00:33:27,921 --> 00:33:31,310
while they were on stage working out the
scenes and they would come up with new

1244
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:32,990
things and to incorporate
those new things.

1245
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,280
So Dave was like constantly tweaking
things and adding things and it was,

1246
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:37,791
you know,

1247
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:41,240
and being able to watch that and to
watch someone do that and to be in that

1248
00:33:41,241 --> 00:33:41,811
situation,

1249
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:42,200
I was like,

1250
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,033
wow.

1251
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:43,520
I was like,

1252
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,190
this is,

1253
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:44,580
this is,

1254
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,300
this is like an ideal situation.

1255
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:47,991
He,

1256
00:33:47,991 --> 00:33:48,340
uh,

1257
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:48,770
I,

1258
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:49,603
I was the,

1259
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:53,060
is this is gonna Sound
Conti Conti but weird.

1260
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:53,721
But,

1261
00:33:53,721 --> 00:33:54,020
uh,

1262
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:59,020
so like last year was a very good year
for me and I'm also in the middle of our,

1263
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,630
our school.

1264
00:34:00,631 --> 00:34:02,610
So like our kids are in third grade and,

1265
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,740
and like now we've been at
school long enough to kind of,

1266
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,670
and we know all the parents
and so like I was this like a,

1267
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:11,810
I was the resident famous comedian parent.

1268
00:34:11,811 --> 00:34:11,931
Like,

1269
00:34:11,931 --> 00:34:12,021
oh,

1270
00:34:12,021 --> 00:34:12,860
he's a comedian.

1271
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,200
I think Dave Foley's kids go to
our school now and Dave Foley,

1272
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:16,521
they were like,

1273
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:17,660
have you heard Dave Foley?

1274
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,580
He spoke at a PTA.

1275
00:34:19,581 --> 00:34:21,830
Mom apparently is a fucking amazing dad.

1276
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:24,710
Like I'm either that or it's a
guy that looks like Dave Foley.

1277
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,690
What do you mean he's amazing dad?

1278
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:29,900
Like he like shows up and
does all the shifts and,

1279
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:30,830
and they were like,

1280
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,051
no,

1281
00:34:31,051 --> 00:34:32,030
and I don't go into anything.

1282
00:34:32,031 --> 00:34:33,140
I don't even go to recitals.

1283
00:34:33,141 --> 00:34:34,070
Like I just fucking,

1284
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,480
he's a very solid dude.

1285
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,830
That was a great set.

1286
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,530
But what I'm saying about Morris,

1287
00:34:38,531 --> 00:34:38,840
she did,

1288
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,673
she was built,

1289
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,220
oh yeah,

1290
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,930
she's very pretty beautiful woman.

1291
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,660
But she didn't have big knocker.

1292
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,650
She was fucking hottest shit.

1293
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,010
She's very,

1294
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:49,400
but you have a Greg Giraldo shot across
from you guys when you guys used to

1295
00:34:49,401 --> 00:34:49,641
party.

1296
00:34:49,641 --> 00:34:49,851
Right.

1297
00:34:49,851 --> 00:34:50,541
And well,

1298
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:50,750
we'll,

1299
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,820
Greg was writing right

1300
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,960
store and um,

1301
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,083
he was,

1302
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,940
there's a lot of guys who had TV shows.

1303
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,450
There was a lot of guys who like
got gigs back in those days.

1304
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,420
It's like they got a development deal
and maybe they had a few episodes.

1305
00:35:03,421 --> 00:35:04,560
Like my friend Tom Rhodes,

1306
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:05,230
he had a show for sure.

1307
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,910
Why can love Tom Rhodes.

1308
00:35:06,911 --> 00:35:07,520
He's a good dude.

1309
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,300
He's a great dude.

1310
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,133
And um,

1311
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,340
I met Tom.

1312
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,530
The first time I met him was
when we were both on NBC.

1313
00:35:12,531 --> 00:35:17,090
I was on news radio and he had his own
show and then he went over to Amsterdam

1314
00:35:17,091 --> 00:35:18,050
and he's,

1315
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,921
Tom's beautiful,

1316
00:35:18,921 --> 00:35:19,754
he's fucking awesome.

1317
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,860
But he never lost his shit,

1318
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:22,701
you know,

1319
00:35:22,701 --> 00:35:23,090
he was,

1320
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:24,050
he's always been cool.

1321
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,183
He's always been like that.

1322
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:27,150
The night I met Tom,

1323
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,183
this is like,

1324
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:28,851
in my opinion,

1325
00:35:28,851 --> 00:35:30,380
like a fucking ledge yet.

1326
00:35:30,381 --> 00:35:31,690
Comedian Tom Rhodes

1327
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:32,523
is from Florida.

1328
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,161
And,

1329
00:35:33,161 --> 00:35:33,550
uh,

1330
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:37,530
I've told him the story a number
of times and he never really it,

1331
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,110
but we ran into each other in Amsterdam.

1332
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,980
We did that showtime
special with Russell Peters.

1333
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,031
And I said,

1334
00:35:42,031 --> 00:35:42,780
uh,

1335
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,180
the fucking first night I met him,

1336
00:35:44,181 --> 00:35:45,300
I was working in the Boston comedy club.

1337
00:35:45,301 --> 00:35:48,180
I came downstairs and he was at the bar
and I knew it was from Florida and I was

1338
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:51,750
from Florida and I like to stand up
and I walked up to him and I was like,

1339
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:52,141
I was like,

1340
00:35:52,141 --> 00:35:52,974
hey man,

1341
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:53,970
my name's Bert.

1342
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:54,803
I'm a comedian.

1343
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:55,650
I just started,

1344
00:35:55,651 --> 00:35:56,490
I'd love to ask you.

1345
00:35:56,491 --> 00:35:57,540
And he stopped me,

1346
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:00,120
like put his hand on my judge
has handled Manchester was like,

1347
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,553
listen,

1348
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,410
you started buying beers and I'll
answer every question you want.

1349
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:04,721
No,

1350
00:36:04,721 --> 00:36:05,380
it's like,

1351
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:05,891
all right.

1352
00:36:05,891 --> 00:36:06,641
So I started,

1353
00:36:06,641 --> 00:36:10,630
I put my fucking Dad's credit card down
and I fucking Bob Beers and talked to

1354
00:36:10,631 --> 00:36:12,040
him about comedy for like three hours.

1355
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,150
So it was fucking great.

1356
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,890
He was one of the one dude's,

1357
00:36:14,891 --> 00:36:15,550
it did,

1358
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:15,820
uh,

1359
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,850
the icehouse chronicles and we had
a long conversation afterwards.

1360
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,020
Who was with you?

1361
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,311
Yeah.

1362
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,150
He was like the comradery.

1363
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:22,991
So cool.

1364
00:36:22,991 --> 00:36:26,410
Here it's like we have like
real comedian comradery.

1365
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,690
He was hammered and I
said I was with the two.

1366
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,190
I think I was with the two I was with.

1367
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,730
I had a guy with me to drive me and I,

1368
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,461
I was like,

1369
00:36:33,461 --> 00:36:33,731
Tom,

1370
00:36:33,731 --> 00:36:35,560
let us take you to your
cause he was hammered.

1371
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,110
Yeah.

1372
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:36,401
Yeah.

1373
00:36:36,401 --> 00:36:38,030
We were trying to tell him
there's no way you're driving.

1374
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:38,710
And he was like,

1375
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:39,280
ah,

1376
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,113
don't worry about me.

1377
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,200
I sleep in a car.

1378
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:42,280
I wake up and I go,

1379
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,460
yeah,

1380
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:43,920
he passed.

1381
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,790
He slept in his car can do that.

1382
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,510
That's illegal.

1383
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:46,601
Well,

1384
00:36:46,601 --> 00:36:47,590
if he's sleeping in your car,

1385
00:36:47,591 --> 00:36:48,424
they'll arrest you.

1386
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:51,070
I just had a simulation
thing happened to me.

1387
00:36:51,071 --> 00:36:51,400
Joe.

1388
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,210
I uh,

1389
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:52,510
that,

1390
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,880
that Denis leary video that we
were talking about last night,

1391
00:36:54,881 --> 00:36:56,200
I watched this movie called happy,

1392
00:36:56,201 --> 00:36:58,660
which is all about depression
and stuff like that.

1393
00:36:58,661 --> 00:36:59,830
It's a documentary on Netflix.

1394
00:36:59,831 --> 00:37:00,251
I recommend.

1395
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:01,030
It's all right.

1396
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:05,320
But there was a guy in the movie that
was like a motivational speaker to kids

1397
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,281
and I was like,

1398
00:37:06,281 --> 00:37:07,000
who is this guy?

1399
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,470
It's the guy on the right right there.

1400
00:37:08,471 --> 00:37:09,350
I've never seen this guy.

1401
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:10,240
Never in my life.

1402
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:10,960
Yeah.

1403
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,810
And now he's in this fucking
bitch going to be on the podcast.

1404
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:14,260
Oh,

1405
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,093
are you serious?

1406
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:18,410
I saw him the second time I
ever did stand up for money.

1407
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:19,730
I opened for Lenny Clarke.

1408
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,620
I used to say it was the first time,

1409
00:37:21,621 --> 00:37:22,431
but it's a lie.

1410
00:37:22,431 --> 00:37:23,061
Ladies and gentleman.

1411
00:37:23,061 --> 00:37:25,220
The first time I opened up a
guy named Warren Mcdonald's.

1412
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,020
That's the first time I ever got paid.

1413
00:37:27,021 --> 00:37:28,550
But the second time I ever got paid,

1414
00:37:28,551 --> 00:37:33,520
the truth is I opened up for Lenny
Clarke and I was in a place called js and

1415
00:37:33,521 --> 00:37:34,011
Pittsfield,

1416
00:37:34,011 --> 00:37:35,780
Massachusetts and Lenny.

1417
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,490
Um,

1418
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,660
he's always been like super cool to me.

1419
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,130
He's going to look how fat Greg Looks.

1420
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,650
Does it look grow fat
will considering like,

1421
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,180
oh now.

1422
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,710
Oh Brian,

1423
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:52,650
where you saw that bit.

1424
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,530
At least you know that Greg
would have been going on.

1425
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,710
I was a horrible joke.

1426
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:57,390
Yeah.

1427
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,141
The big guy,

1428
00:37:58,141 --> 00:37:58,974
by the way,

1429
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,750
Lenny has lost a shitload of weight.

1430
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,051
Yeah.

1431
00:38:02,051 --> 00:38:02,950
Lenny is really good.

1432
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,040
Wait,

1433
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,250
wait.

1434
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:05,990
Is this serious?

1435
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:10,130
In that documentary he was pulling out
towels because he wouldn't stop sweating.

1436
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:11,000
And I was telling,

1437
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,830
I was talking to the girl I was
with last night and I was like,

1438
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:13,821
isn't that crazy?

1439
00:38:13,821 --> 00:38:17,510
He's just standing there talking
to kids and he can't stop sweating.

1440
00:38:17,511 --> 00:38:19,460
There's like sweat all over his body.

1441
00:38:19,461 --> 00:38:20,294
It's documentary.

1442
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:24,220
It's called happy and I just saw it last
night and never seen this guy before in

1443
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:26,510
my life and I just pull up this
video and he's in this video.

1444
00:38:26,511 --> 00:38:27,440
It's so fucking,

1445
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:29,630
where's the part where Greg,

1446
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,130
we did that.

1447
00:38:32,131 --> 00:38:33,330
A movie together.

1448
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:34,740
Here comes the boom,

1449
00:38:34,741 --> 00:38:39,180
the Kevin movie and Lenny Clarke was in
that movie because it was shot in Boston

1450
00:38:39,181 --> 00:38:41,220
and Lenny played a local Boston guy,

1451
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,750
Lenny Clarke,

1452
00:38:42,751 --> 00:38:44,460
which I fucking love that guy,

1453
00:38:44,461 --> 00:38:46,650
but he's lost a lot of weight man.

1454
00:38:46,651 --> 00:38:48,570
He lost a ton of where he looks great.

1455
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,160
I mean he's like really lean.

1456
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:50,994
He doesn't have a,

1457
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:51,931
I've got it.

1458
00:38:51,931 --> 00:38:52,764
All right,

1459
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:56,740
Dalia guy gotta work right

1460
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,140
for reasonable price.

1461
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,131
And I could come back,

1462
00:39:04,131 --> 00:39:06,000
we get out of a piece
and like they did an,

1463
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:09,640
is this where they might find out?

1464
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:10,041
Well,

1465
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:10,370
it's,

1466
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:10,670
it's,

1467
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,000
it's,

1468
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,781
it's about the time,

1469
00:39:11,781 --> 00:39:12,614
I think right here.

1470
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,223
Yeah.

1471
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:15,431
Well,

1472
00:39:15,431 --> 00:39:15,720
yeah.

1473
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:15,910
Well,

1474
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,270
what happened to lap Denis leary?

1475
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,340
He gets mad at Greg.

1476
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:20,260
Geraldo has prepared material.

1477
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,910
It's really hilarious.

1478
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:25,010
And that's how he found out
where they were buried the ball.

1479
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:25,330
Yeah,

1480
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,163
I know.

1481
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,550
Is it during the news of hazard?

1482
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,190
I Dunno.

1483
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:36,190
Someone should like find this off air
and figure it out because it's a really

1484
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,413
good job.

1485
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,080
Well,

1486
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,610
there might be their outcome for a,

1487
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,810
what is a nonviolent way to,

1488
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:46,550
to solve the problem with the copy that
we hate that hate dozens got weapons

1489
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:46,971
pointed this.

1490
00:39:46,971 --> 00:39:47,660
I don't think so.

1491
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:47,781
No,

1492
00:39:47,781 --> 00:39:48,081
you're right.

1493
00:39:48,081 --> 00:39:49,010
Like Russia for example,

1494
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:49,940
that big Russian war.

1495
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:51,980
Yeah.

1496
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,980
There are things that,

1497
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,710
there are things that are,

1498
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:57,643
yeah.

1499
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,570
But there our approach to their economic
benefit that we're giving them in order

1500
00:40:00,571 --> 00:40:00,691
to,

1501
00:40:00,691 --> 00:40:02,490
for them to stop developing their weapons.

1502
00:40:02,491 --> 00:40:02,940
I mean,

1503
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,380
I heard weekly they agree to stop,

1504
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:04,920
uh,

1505
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,850
stop building nuke.

1506
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,670
If American women agree to get their
nails done at least twice a week.

1507
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,930
I ran a good boy.

1508
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:12,550
You're,

1509
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,220
you can make so many
jokes before the show.

1510
00:40:14,221 --> 00:40:15,054
It's not even applying.

1511
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,140
Unbelievable.

1512
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:16,771
He's got to,

1513
00:40:16,771 --> 00:40:17,890
he's got pocket follow.

1514
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,930
Not Good.

1515
00:40:20,931 --> 00:40:21,580
I'm just saying.

1516
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,210
I don't know.

1517
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:22,480
I'll have,

1518
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,430
it was my dad.

1519
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,540
That's kind of what we do here.

1520
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,713
A comedy writer.

1521
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,653
Oh boy.

1522
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:34,690
The guy who did all the homework and
then after there was any more that needed

1523
00:40:34,691 --> 00:40:35,524
to be done.

1524
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:37,270
That's a good point.

1525
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:37,891
And if you would try it,

1526
00:40:37,891 --> 00:40:38,681
a little comedy writing,

1527
00:40:38,681 --> 00:40:39,940
maybe your show and still be on the air.

1528
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,790
Can you tell me all the time

1529
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,880
he just crushed it,

1530
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:54,790
you know?

1531
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:55,623
But that's

1532
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,370
[inaudible] happens when dudes get famous.

1533
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,290
I think you guy can't
come along and clown.

1534
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,133
You

1535
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,091
tell me about it.

1536
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,910
It's a first time I went on the road and
I realize there are killers that I've

1537
00:41:03,911 --> 00:41:04,511
never heard of.

1538
00:41:04,511 --> 00:41:05,150
No.

1539
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:07,410
When a guy gets famous to
a point where you're uh,

1540
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:07,700
uh,

1541
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,590
Tom Cruise or any,

1542
00:41:09,591 --> 00:41:09,891
any,

1543
00:41:09,891 --> 00:41:11,170
any sort of a person who's been in moving.

1544
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:11,570
Yeah,

1545
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,350
Dennis Leary,

1546
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:15,110
when that came out and had
been in a ton of movies,

1547
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,670
he had been in some really
high profile movies.

1548
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,540
I mean he thought of himself
as a guy who had made it,

1549
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,980
so I think he probably assumed he was
going to get a certain level of respect.

1550
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,023
So where all,

1551
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,970
maybe if you did a little writing,

1552
00:41:28,971 --> 00:41:30,410
your show would still be on the air.

1553
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,140
That was like a nuclear weapon
that he didn't see common.

1554
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:33,901
He didn't see that.

1555
00:41:33,901 --> 00:41:34,130
Tell

1556
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,730
me that all you got detonated is that,

1557
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:40,560
oh for that was Hubris.

1558
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:43,920
You look at the look on journalists face
and you can see his eyes twitching and

1559
00:41:43,921 --> 00:41:47,820
you can see him go angry going three,

1560
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:48,271
two,

1561
00:41:48,271 --> 00:41:48,811
I got this,

1562
00:41:48,811 --> 00:41:49,381
I got this.

1563
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,740
And then like making is making
it as tactical colonists had.

1564
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,280
You could see that happening almost.

1565
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,870
It's a superior mind,

1566
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:57,030
superior mind.

1567
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,550
Just not as famous but a superior product.

1568
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,241
Like what he would,

1569
00:42:00,241 --> 00:42:01,350
he would put out his points of view.

1570
00:42:01,351 --> 00:42:02,184
It'd be superior.

1571
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,031
I'll watch his hour.

1572
00:42:03,031 --> 00:42:05,930
I got the idea that there would be
like something funny and sign it.

1573
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,990
Someone prepared,

1574
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:07,941
like look at him.

1575
00:42:07,941 --> 00:42:09,150
He for being a bully.

1576
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,500
But that's the idea.

1577
00:42:10,501 --> 00:42:11,340
That was ridiculous.

1578
00:42:11,341 --> 00:42:12,990
Like it's so crazy.

1579
00:42:12,991 --> 00:42:13,200
Like,

1580
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,160
oh look at the painter.

1581
00:42:14,161 --> 00:42:15,120
He went and painted

1582
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:15,760
like,

1583
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,700
what the fuck?

1584
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,130
It's a,

1585
00:42:18,131 --> 00:42:18,521
there's a,

1586
00:42:18,521 --> 00:42:20,050
there's a certain personality that,

1587
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,490
and I'm not going to speak,

1588
00:42:21,491 --> 00:42:21,640
I don't,

1589
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,960
I'm not saying this is Denis leary,

1590
00:42:22,961 --> 00:42:27,700
but there is certain personality that's
so arrogant in that the way I say it

1591
00:42:27,701 --> 00:42:30,010
will be so much better
than the way you say it,

1592
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,620
as opposed to what I say is
better than what you say.

1593
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,430
So like,

1594
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:35,740
like you could hear the statement
before him when he says,

1595
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:36,560
oh,

1596
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,920
well we're going to go to
war with a country like the,

1597
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:40,210
it was very arrogant and he was like,

1598
00:42:40,211 --> 00:42:40,340
yeah,

1599
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,910
like that great Russian
war that does fucking work.

1600
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,800
You're not listen to the words you're,

1601
00:42:44,801 --> 00:42:45,041
you're,

1602
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:46,600
you're overlooking the thought.

1603
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:47,780
Well,

1604
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:52,550
he hasn't this idea that
somehow or another he's going
to be able to solve what

1605
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,640
hundreds of scholars and heads of states
and diplomats and emissary workers and

1606
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:01,130
no one can solve.

1607
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:01,761
No one can solve.

1608
00:43:01,761 --> 00:43:04,740
But he's going to come along and tell
you exactly how things need to be blunt.

1609
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:07,820
The ideas of,

1610
00:43:07,821 --> 00:43:08,654
first of all,

1611
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:12,080
the communication between nations where
they don't even speak the same fucking

1612
00:43:12,081 --> 00:43:12,690
language.

1613
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:12,931
Yeah.

1614
00:43:12,931 --> 00:43:14,300
And how difficult that shit is.

1615
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:19,570
It's so fucking hard just to understand
things and cultural context and explain

1616
00:43:21,531 --> 00:43:24,470
those different people that are in
your country that you're sort of

1617
00:43:24,471 --> 00:43:25,304
representing.

1618
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,490
Because Koreans are not like Americans
and Americans and all I Koreans,

1619
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:31,730
people that live in North Korea do not
understand how we're living in North

1620
00:43:31,731 --> 00:43:34,160
America and the people in North
America for the most part,

1621
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:37,670
really a fairly ignorant about what
the fuck is going on in North Korea.

1622
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:40,910
And one of the big reasons is because
we can't fuck them communicate with each

1623
00:43:40,911 --> 00:43:42,860
other because we could
communicate with each other.

1624
00:43:42,861 --> 00:43:47,861
If everybody in Korean and North Korea
knew how to speak English and they all

1625
00:43:48,021 --> 00:43:51,140
could read the shit on the Internet about
how the world is run and what the fuck

1626
00:43:51,141 --> 00:43:53,960
is really going on in the country and
how the rest of the world views things,

1627
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,170
they would probably slowly
but surely take action.

1628
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:01,700
But the fact that there they're
separate from the rest of the world,

1629
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,070
in fact they speak this one,

1630
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:04,460
you know,

1631
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:06,440
very unique sort of a language.

1632
00:44:06,441 --> 00:44:11,000
It's difficult to learn and he's in
translatable very easily to English or

1633
00:44:11,001 --> 00:44:11,930
Spanish or

1634
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:12,751
there's Korean.

1635
00:44:12,751 --> 00:44:14,520
Not translatable is difficult

1636
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,040
symbol.

1637
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:17,431
You know the,

1638
00:44:17,431 --> 00:44:17,601
the,

1639
00:44:17,601 --> 00:44:17,881
this,

1640
00:44:17,881 --> 00:44:18,840
the way things are written,

1641
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,400
we're good friends are Korean
and that when you go to a car,

1642
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,470
we went to a Korean barbecue.

1643
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:23,281
It was Roy Choi.

1644
00:44:23,281 --> 00:44:24,900
He's the guy that started the Taco truck.

1645
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:26,100
The concept of the TACO truck.

1646
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:26,963
It's him.

1647
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:27,671
He started,

1648
00:44:27,671 --> 00:44:28,330
it started.

1649
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:29,430
It was the first guy,

1650
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:31,530
the premise of these correlation,

1651
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,180
these gourmet taco trucks.

1652
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:33,730
He's Asian.

1653
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:34,320
Yeah.

1654
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,153
Roy Choi.

1655
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,121
He does.

1656
00:44:36,121 --> 00:44:39,030
He's good friends with Bordain
Asians don't give a fuck dude.

1657
00:44:39,031 --> 00:44:39,900
Then you get things done.

1658
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,351
They get things done.

1659
00:44:41,351 --> 00:44:43,920
I don't think they really get it done.

1660
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,090
If I can get things done,

1661
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:48,870
they really do the
fucking future of America.

1662
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:50,213
When you eat,

1663
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,950
how the fuck did they ever
figure out how to get,

1664
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:56,010
I don't even know what you've said yet.

1665
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:56,690
Full.

1666
00:44:56,690 --> 00:45:01,690
A full like strangle hold
on the manufacturer of like
electronic parts and TV's

1667
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:07,470
and

1668
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:08,303
cars.

1669
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,061
Cars,

1670
00:45:09,061 --> 00:45:10,050
cars are over there now.

1671
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,490
They're going to wear in Detroit.

1672
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:13,140
No one's doing cars in Detroit.

1673
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:13,711
Well,

1674
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,990
isn't Chrysler stolen to
Detroit and hasn't forward?

1675
00:45:15,991 --> 00:45:16,291
No,

1676
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:17,430
but no one's in Detroit.

1677
00:45:17,431 --> 00:45:21,780
Detroit's apparently imperil because
everyone took their business to Asia.

1678
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:22,550
Why?

1679
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:22,750
It's,

1680
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:23,221
it's more,

1681
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:23,791
is it more,

1682
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:24,750
is it more a,

1683
00:45:24,751 --> 00:45:28,260
an idiocracy not idiocracy a theocracy,

1684
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,160
not theocracy.

1685
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,060
What's worth looking for?

1686
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,530
Any is a accuracy.

1687
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:32,940
What do you,

1688
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,750
what are you trying to where like where
it's like the idea of the state is

1689
00:45:36,751 --> 00:45:37,740
better than the person.

1690
00:45:37,741 --> 00:45:42,450
So everyone looks up to the state and
it's something like that where they care

1691
00:45:42,451 --> 00:45:43,231
about their job.

1692
00:45:43,231 --> 00:45:44,490
Like Americans just don't care.

1693
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:45,301
Well,

1694
00:45:45,301 --> 00:45:50,301
you know what happened is first of all
the cars they made sucked that that

1695
00:45:50,821 --> 00:45:51,880
happened in American.

1696
00:45:51,881 --> 00:45:52,170
Yeah.

1697
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:53,190
This something happened.

1698
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:54,180
We have to,

1699
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:55,990
there was a period where
we got really lazy.

1700
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:01,020
What the fuck went wrong from like 1973
the Ford Tempo and 90 fucking Ford tempo

1701
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:02,920
is a fucking was a,

1702
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:05,410
that was a phone in job by the Americans.

1703
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:10,740
Like that car sat dick Suck
Dick in 1989 Ford tempo

1704
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:13,901
for Tiempo.

1705
00:46:13,901 --> 00:46:15,760
What the fuck happened to the Mustang?

1706
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:16,530
Okay.

1707
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:19,490
Because I can say this,

1708
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,230
I can say this,

1709
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:21,310
I have a Mustang today.

1710
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,160
I have a Shelby gt 500
and I fucking love it.

1711
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:24,910
Okay.

1712
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:29,910
But that's a 2010 and between like
1965 and 1972 or 73 they had some dope

1713
00:46:34,721 --> 00:46:35,380
fucking car.

1714
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:40,380
Really like to 69 but then something
happened and like the 70s and the 80s like

1715
00:46:40,751 --> 00:46:43,690
you call that up fucking Mustang.

1716
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:46,060
What are you a communist?

1717
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:51,180
What did would a terrorist infiltrate
the fucking the four plants and hold down

1718
00:46:52,361 --> 00:46:55,480
the designers by gunpoint
and gay up all the drawings.

1719
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:55,891
I go,

1720
00:46:55,891 --> 00:46:56,651
oh fuck.

1721
00:46:56,651 --> 00:46:59,330
Do you call that by the way I spelled gay.

1722
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:02,800
G H e y them gave them Joe homosexuals

1723
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:03,070
like,

1724
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:03,380
like,

1725
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:04,860
cause I wonder if it was a,

1726
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:06,520
it had to do with homosexuality and the,

1727
00:47:06,521 --> 00:47:07,840
and the fear of homophobia.

1728
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:11,230
And they took all these great gay
designers that were super closeted in the

1729
00:47:11,231 --> 00:47:12,330
fifties and then got,

1730
00:47:12,331 --> 00:47:14,500
and then there was this
manliness and they disappeared.

1731
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:17,710
You trying to say that Dick
Suck and design the corvette?

1732
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:18,971
No,

1733
00:47:18,971 --> 00:47:21,340
there's no way you can tell me as a man,

1734
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:24,430
what is sexy without
knowing sexy as a man.

1735
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,500
What the fuck are you
talking about Pete Townsend?

1736
00:47:26,501 --> 00:47:29,840
Corvette is the sexiest
car you can put me in.

1737
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:30,823
Is it really?

1738
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:35,060
I just drove one from Miami to Marco
Island and I tell you right now,

1739
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:36,200
the second I sat in that seat,

1740
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:39,380
I would let the steering wheel be close
to my face cause I wanted it there.

1741
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:40,490
It was just fucking,

1742
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:41,741
it was God,

1743
00:47:41,741 --> 00:47:42,291
God kind of car.

1744
00:47:42,291 --> 00:47:43,190
Was it a corvette?

1745
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,053
Which here?

1746
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:44,930
Brand new,

1747
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,540
brand new 3000 miles convertible.

1748
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,640
There's new ones.

1749
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,290
Was it a four 26 I have no,

1750
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:51,820
I have no idea what 26 is.

1751
00:47:51,821 --> 00:47:55,400
They have the zero six zero six
engine and suspension and okay.

1752
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:56,030
Convertible.

1753
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:57,590
So fucking hot.

1754
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,330
Like I just melt Cooley Shit.

1755
00:47:59,350 --> 00:47:59,770
Now

1756
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:00,490
that's not a corvette,

1757
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:00,791
Brian.

1758
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:02,500
That's a god Damn Miata and it's pink.

1759
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,700
How dare you?

1760
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:09,600
How dare you hate America on
this podcast hating or my rook.

1761
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:12,280
Cool.

1762
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:13,363
I got to pimp.

1763
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:13,671
Well,

1764
00:48:13,671 --> 00:48:14,840
why don't you go poop man.

1765
00:48:14,841 --> 00:48:15,470
We'll wait.

1766
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:16,101
We'll hold on.

1767
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:16,850
Yeah.

1768
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:18,770
What time is your ra common show tonight,

1769
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:19,101
Brian.

1770
00:48:19,101 --> 00:48:19,934
And can kind of,

1771
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:22,430
can we guide people in
your general direction?

1772
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,130
I'm just going to try
to get up somewhere now.

1773
00:48:25,131 --> 00:48:25,791
When you do that,

1774
00:48:25,791 --> 00:48:26,150
what do you do?

1775
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:27,080
You just show up and say,

1776
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,790
oh I didn't try to sneak my way in.

1777
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:29,000
Hey,

1778
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,400
my name's Brian Red Band and
you might know me on Twitter.

1779
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:33,213
Is that what you do?

1780
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:37,590
Why don't you start it
started start a a room.

1781
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:38,463
Your own Brian.

1782
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:38,761
Huh?

1783
00:48:38,761 --> 00:48:39,271
I did.

1784
00:48:39,271 --> 00:48:40,680
I have like three rooms every.

1785
00:48:40,681 --> 00:48:42,270
So do you think ever will

1786
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,340
be all contained under one roof?

1787
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,450
Do you think that ever the full desk
squad family will have podcast studios in

1788
00:48:48,451 --> 00:48:51,330
one gigantic warehouse and
cause that's what I'm saying.

1789
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:55,350
I'm at the saying we also duplicate
this at the Onnit compound in Texas.

1790
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:55,741
Why didn't,

1791
00:48:55,741 --> 00:48:56,121
why not?

1792
00:48:56,121 --> 00:48:56,480
Yes.

1793
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,860
Austin fence.

1794
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,970
Thousands of acres are on
lake plus deer to shoot.

1795
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:02,691
How do we get it?

1796
00:49:02,691 --> 00:49:04,310
How do we get a power bitch?

1797
00:49:04,311 --> 00:49:05,720
Did I say what?

1798
00:49:05,721 --> 00:49:06,554
What?

1799
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,510
Maybe we can have her
own fucking satellite.

1800
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:08,811
Okay.

1801
00:49:08,811 --> 00:49:09,644
How do we get it?

1802
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:10,530
Oh,

1803
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:11,790
like a death squad,

1804
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:15,330
like studio in a warehouse
where we can make TV shows.

1805
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,710
I don't want to make it a CV,

1806
00:49:16,711 --> 00:49:17,880
so why not?

1807
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,833
Why not?

1808
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,100
It just needs to be an umbrella.

1809
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:24,530
If I'm making a TV show,

1810
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:25,630
here's my next TV show.

1811
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:26,280
I'm going to play it

1812
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:26,820
cool.

1813
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:27,600
Around the spine.

1814
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,380
Is Boring,

1815
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:31,450
boring for you bitch?

1816
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,180
It's not 99% of the people

1817
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:34,790
he is.

1818
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:36,850
We were very close to a sign.

1819
00:49:36,851 --> 00:49:37,780
I can't say with WHO.

1820
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:38,860
There's a,

1821
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,480
there's a show that is a,

1822
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:41,090
um,

1823
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:41,800
uh,

1824
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,690
a lot of it is based in the podcast.

1825
00:49:43,691 --> 00:49:44,320
What are you doing?

1826
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,180
Taking text messages?

1827
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:46,660
Come at them live on the air.

1828
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:47,390
No,

1829
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:49,340
this person said that they
got a new phone number.

1830
00:49:49,341 --> 00:49:49,641
They're like,

1831
00:49:49,641 --> 00:49:50,001
sorry,

1832
00:49:50,001 --> 00:49:51,620
I got a new phone number and
I thought they were lying,

1833
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:53,210
but now they're sending
me pictures of this.

1834
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,050
Is that,

1835
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:54,500
is that,

1836
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,333
who is that?

1837
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,300
It's an Aussie.

1838
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,080
Is that Kadafi?

1839
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:57,460
Yeah.

1840
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:57,681
All right,

1841
00:49:57,681 --> 00:49:59,720
so might be not the
person I'm thinking of it.

1842
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,580
Okay.

1843
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:02,230
You getting someone sending you a murder?

1844
00:50:02,231 --> 00:50:03,064
The people.

1845
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:04,520
What's that?

1846
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,530
What's a new TV show you're doing?

1847
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:06,001
Oh,

1848
00:50:06,001 --> 00:50:06,630
it's uh,

1849
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:10,290
it's based a lot of it on his like
controversial subjects and a lot of it,

1850
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,610
it'll be all of it.

1851
00:50:11,611 --> 00:50:13,200
We'll start off from the podcast,

1852
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:15,470
like examining all
sorts of different ways.

1853
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:16,360
There's no tenant,

1854
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:16,770
well,

1855
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:17,820
we sort of have a tentative title,

1856
00:50:17,821 --> 00:50:19,170
but I'm not necessarily happy with it.

1857
00:50:19,171 --> 00:50:23,790
So the idea is like the way we've done
the podcast where we explore all these

1858
00:50:23,791 --> 00:50:24,511
different ideas,

1859
00:50:24,511 --> 00:50:26,790
whether it's a shamanism or,

1860
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:30,420
or big foot or Ufo
shows are fringe topics,

1861
00:50:30,421 --> 00:50:31,380
crop circles,

1862
00:50:31,381 --> 00:50:32,310
reincarnation,

1863
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:33,323
psychics,

1864
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,260
and we're going to talk
about it on the podcast.

1865
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:41,100
I'll have a guy like you or Ari or Duncan
or Jolie or any comedian come on and

1866
00:50:41,101 --> 00:50:41,611
we'll say,

1867
00:50:41,611 --> 00:50:42,240
you know what?

1868
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:42,571
It's like,

1869
00:50:42,571 --> 00:50:43,350
we'll do it right now.

1870
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:44,270
What do you think about big foot?

1871
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:44,760
Do you think?

1872
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,650
Do you think that is possible?

1873
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:51,420
There could be an undiscovered primate
that people have been talking about

1874
00:50:51,421 --> 00:50:53,520
reporting for ages and
it's somehow or another,

1875
00:50:53,521 --> 00:50:58,521
it alluded photography except for a
few really questionable photos and some

1876
00:50:59,251 --> 00:51:01,950
really fucking shitty video
that looks fake as fuck.

1877
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:03,900
Put all that aside,

1878
00:51:03,901 --> 00:51:04,160
Paul,

1879
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:04,891
the hoaxes aside,

1880
00:51:04,891 --> 00:51:05,730
do you think it's possible?

1881
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:06,540
It's possible.

1882
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:07,260
100%.

1883
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:07,820
Why do you think?

1884
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:08,670
Cause I believe,

1885
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:09,390
whoa.

1886
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:09,601
Yeah.

1887
00:51:09,601 --> 00:51:10,434
I believe,

1888
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:10,810
wow.

1889
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:12,130
I believe in Loch lochness monster.

1890
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:13,300
I believe in Tuba.

1891
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,200
Coffee can fly.

1892
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,730
Do I believe I can fly

1893
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,380
pee on you if you're a 14 year old girl
and you didn't know why you were there?

1894
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:23,950
I definitely believe that I have
the capability to fly in my body.

1895
00:51:23,951 --> 00:51:25,000
I just haven't figured it out.

1896
00:51:25,001 --> 00:51:25,231
And we'll,

1897
00:51:25,231 --> 00:51:26,430
once we do tap into that,

1898
00:51:26,431 --> 00:51:27,264
I will be able to fly.

1899
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:27,810
Okay.

1900
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:28,690
But like Bill Hicks,

1901
00:51:28,691 --> 00:51:30,450
she used to say star on the ground floor,

1902
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:36,760
like set a great joke
about the young man acid.

1903
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,090
Thought he could fly lept to his death.

1904
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:42,480
What a tragedy it goes when an idiot
because you taught him can fly.

1905
00:51:42,481 --> 00:51:45,330
Why did he start off from the ground go?

1906
00:51:45,331 --> 00:51:46,021
You feel like that?

1907
00:51:46,021 --> 00:51:47,350
I remember when Star Wars Wars,

1908
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:49,100
Star wars return of the Jedi came out.

1909
00:51:49,101 --> 00:51:49,161
No,

1910
00:51:49,161 --> 00:51:49,311
no,

1911
00:51:49,311 --> 00:51:49,581
no.

1912
00:51:49,581 --> 00:51:50,000
Uh,

1913
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,230
empire strikes back came out.

1914
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:56,480
I remember watching Luke move stuff with
his mind and I remember being in the

1915
00:51:56,481 --> 00:51:59,480
back of my car trying
to do that hardest fuck,

1916
00:51:59,481 --> 00:52:00,470
like staring at objects,

1917
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:04,980
trying to make shit swear to God.

1918
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:05,411
I was like,

1919
00:52:05,411 --> 00:52:07,000
that seems logical.

1920
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:11,030
Well there's certain aspects of
life it seems so preposterous.

1921
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:12,400
Unrelenting electricity.

1922
00:52:12,401 --> 00:52:13,240
What the fuck is that?

1923
00:52:13,241 --> 00:52:14,020
It just hits you.

1924
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:15,160
Have you seen those Tesla and

1925
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,250
like experiments where he was like
touching electricity and it was like a

1926
00:52:18,251 --> 00:52:22,900
Bolton's flying big Tesla coil
and is connected to his arm.

1927
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:23,740
Hold on.

1928
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:24,910
Have you seen any of those photos?

1929
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:26,460
Did Tesla just can I,

1930
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,480
have you seen the new Tesla fucking car?

1931
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:33,320
Did you see them all explode when
hurricane sandy hit the beach in a,

1932
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:33,661
in,

1933
00:52:33,661 --> 00:52:34,450
in New Jersey?

1934
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:34,840
What?

1935
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:35,201
Yeah,

1936
00:52:35,201 --> 00:52:37,510
there was a whole warehouse
that had like this.

1937
00:52:37,511 --> 00:52:37,990
Uh,

1938
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:38,381
they were,

1939
00:52:38,381 --> 00:52:38,621
uh,

1940
00:52:38,621 --> 00:52:39,670
they had a dock in,

1941
00:52:39,671 --> 00:52:41,110
they had all these new

1942
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:42,091
Karmas.

1943
00:52:42,091 --> 00:52:42,870
That's what it was.

1944
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:44,010
The Fisker Karma.

1945
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:45,220
Was it a Tesla as though

1946
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:47,420
the grant?

1947
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:47,571
It's,

1948
00:52:47,571 --> 00:52:48,420
it looks gorgeous.

1949
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:49,561
Quite a few.

1950
00:52:49,561 --> 00:52:49,660
Yeah.

1951
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:51,610
Really beautiful electric cars right now.

1952
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:56,320
But the Fisker Karma is the one and they
have like a 16 of them I think exploded

1953
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:57,041
on the,

1954
00:52:57,041 --> 00:52:58,270
on the docks.

1955
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:01,140
They had them on the docks and
the water came up on the water,

1956
00:53:01,141 --> 00:53:02,940
hit these fucking electric

1957
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:09,530
transformer clocking blew
up and everybody was like,

1958
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:11,580
Oh okay.

1959
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:12,683
Shit.

1960
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:14,700
I don't think they knew that would happen.

1961
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:15,710
What happens if you drive?

1962
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:17,310
We're fucking standing water.

1963
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,020
What have you tried to home from a flood?

1964
00:53:19,021 --> 00:53:20,940
Is Your fucking car explode?

1965
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:21,481
Okay.

1966
00:53:21,481 --> 00:53:23,490
Cause I can deal with my car shorting out.

1967
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,120
It's sitting,

1968
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,500
they're scared to leave.

1969
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,960
If I can save like two bucks a gallon,

1970
00:53:28,961 --> 00:53:31,480
but my car explodes when I hit a puddle.

1971
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:33,310
Is that going to happen?

1972
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,030
Is that what the fuck is really going on?

1973
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,950
That does that Tessa looks bad.

1974
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:38,650
Shit,

1975
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:39,483
we've won a,

1976
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:40,670
it was either murdered,

1977
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:43,750
murdered motor trend
or road and track car.

1978
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:46,790
The year one of those big
magazines made it the car,

1979
00:53:46,791 --> 00:53:47,450
the or the uh,

1980
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:47,961
Tesla,

1981
00:53:47,961 --> 00:53:50,150
not the roadster but the larger car.

1982
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:52,100
Something that something asks.

1983
00:53:52,101 --> 00:53:54,380
It's a like a four door and uh,

1984
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,990
apparently it's just a
marvel of engineering,

1985
00:53:56,991 --> 00:53:57,824
but

1986
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:01,880
the real problem is going to
be a row state taxes on roads.

1987
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,170
The roads are going to shit.

1988
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:03,700
This is a lot

1989
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:04,570
problems though.

1990
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,900
Then another problem is the fact that
everybody wants to pretend that buying

1991
00:54:07,901 --> 00:54:12,300
some sort of an electric car removes
you from the fossil fuel food chain.

1992
00:54:12,301 --> 00:54:12,700
Yeah.

1993
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:17,080
But it doesn't and in fact it connects
you with some even shady or minerals on

1994
00:54:17,081 --> 00:54:20,770
like a really large scale like lithium
ion and all those different minerals.

1995
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,990
A lot of those or conflict minerals,

1996
00:54:22,991 --> 00:54:24,430
they come from the Congo,

1997
00:54:24,431 --> 00:54:25,930
they come from Afghanistan.

1998
00:54:25,931 --> 00:54:28,270
They come from like if I was Brian Count,

1999
00:54:28,271 --> 00:54:29,420
I'd say I've got a stone.

2000
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,730
If I was a amber Lyon,

2001
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:33,341
I'd say,

2002
00:54:33,341 --> 00:54:33,630
uh,

2003
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:34,950
what was it?

2004
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:35,680
She was fine.

2005
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,600
Bahrain please.

2006
00:54:36,601 --> 00:54:38,420
Not In the bottom lane lane.

2007
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:39,453
Yeah.

2008
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:40,370
The,

2009
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:41,420
you know these,

2010
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,040
these minerals that you,

2011
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:46,550
you need to create a lithium
ion battery by the way.

2012
00:54:46,551 --> 00:54:47,151
Mad Labs,

2013
00:54:47,151 --> 00:54:49,310
Brian Callan and mad love to amber line,

2014
00:54:49,311 --> 00:54:50,144
which is fucking with you.

2015
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:52,970
Those minerals that you
need to make batteries.

2016
00:54:52,971 --> 00:54:56,720
They come from like really fucking
imprisoned and poverished areas,

2017
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:58,010
their conflict minerals,

2018
00:54:58,011 --> 00:55:00,410
lithium ion is officially
like a conflict mineral.

2019
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,440
Like a lot of the shit that you
need to even make cell phones.

2020
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:04,460
It's like,

2021
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:06,970
I think vice had a guide they had,

2022
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:11,510
they did a a vice guide to travel episode
where Shane Smith went to the Congo.

2023
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,280
I don't know why they're
not all the travel channel.

2024
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:15,930
I would love to see one of their
fucking shows because it's too deep.

2025
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,120
They go to the same shipboard aim does.

2026
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:18,510
No,

2027
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:20,000
they go way further than Baroda and

2028
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:28,450
further extended mean close assignment
clothes where vice vice goes to the

2029
00:55:28,451 --> 00:55:30,190
fucking Congo deep,

2030
00:55:30,191 --> 00:55:30,491
deep,

2031
00:55:30,491 --> 00:55:32,290
deep and talks to warlords.

2032
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:32,730
Really?

2033
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:34,150
Did they go looking for dinosaur?

2034
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:34,830
Yeah,

2035
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:35,120
I would.

2036
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:35,400
I would.

2037
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,270
I'd love to see that.

2038
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:37,770
I didn't they you put that on,

2039
00:55:37,771 --> 00:55:38,500
why not?

2040
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,930
We enjoy watching her on the Internet.

2041
00:55:39,931 --> 00:55:40,580
Why can't travel,

2042
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:41,130
boy

2043
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:42,000
your correct.

2044
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:42,960
However,

2045
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,510
most people that run these organizations,

2046
00:55:45,511 --> 00:55:47,090
whether it's a network or you know,

2047
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:49,470
you know cable or,

2048
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:51,600
or whether it was broadcast television,

2049
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:52,290
they,

2050
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:54,510
they're very conservative because
they're trying to sell advertising.

2051
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:55,220
Yeah.

2052
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,080
So when a,

2053
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:00,670
when a company like vice comes along
and they have like really in there,

2054
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:04,520
they have no respect for any corporation
at all because they'll do what the fuck

2055
00:56:04,521 --> 00:56:05,750
they need to do to make what they think.

2056
00:56:05,751 --> 00:56:09,650
They have videos where Hamilton Morris
goes into the jungle and he's taking

2057
00:56:09,651 --> 00:56:13,480
Chris Drugs and align on
his back and you know,

2058
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:16,670
I mean it's like they're not going
to sell tide during those times.

2059
00:56:16,671 --> 00:56:17,120
You know,

2060
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,760
they're going to have to accept
that they're not yourself time,

2061
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,460
but they do see that's
what's really stupid.

2062
00:56:22,461 --> 00:56:24,230
It's like there's weird sort

2063
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:26,570
of game that we play.

2064
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:31,280
Whereas we pretend that the people that
see all the fucked up things that you

2065
00:56:31,281 --> 00:56:35,120
can find on the Internet are not the
same people that wash their clothes.

2066
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:35,791
Yeah.

2067
00:56:35,791 --> 00:56:37,910
That wash their clothes
or wash my clothes,

2068
00:56:37,911 --> 00:56:42,911
my gas or any of the variables and the
end of the things where we try to target

2069
00:56:43,071 --> 00:56:43,760
people.

2070
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,091
We're all,

2071
00:56:44,091 --> 00:56:45,440
we're all the same fucking people,

2072
00:56:45,441 --> 00:56:45,681
man.

2073
00:56:45,681 --> 00:56:48,650
And yet we just have
access to different shit.

2074
00:56:48,651 --> 00:56:50,270
Now we need to accept that.

2075
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:53,660
You need to just stop pretending that
we're living in some sort of a Catholic

2076
00:56:53,661 --> 00:56:54,440
school,

2077
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:54,921
you know,

2078
00:56:54,921 --> 00:56:59,030
a Sandra Bullock movie view of the world.

2079
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,050
It's not,

2080
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:01,100
it's not reality.

2081
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:04,760
Reality is there's a lot of fucked up
shit about out there and I can find it

2082
00:57:04,761 --> 00:57:04,971
now.

2083
00:57:04,971 --> 00:57:06,080
I can find it on the Internet.

2084
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:07,123
It's really easy.

2085
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:10,760
So you need to sort of adjust your
expectations accordingly because there's a

2086
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:11,570
lot of evidence,

2087
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:12,980
a lot of evidence that shows that reality.

2088
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:14,120
It's pretty fucking slippery.

2089
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:15,050
Yeah.

2090
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:16,250
There's a lot of nutty shit outfit,

2091
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:19,280
but that tells the car
looks bad is fuck yeah,

2092
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:21,350
but it will explode if he hit a puddle.

2093
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:23,840
What a horrible feeling.

2094
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:24,980
It look dope.

2095
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:25,521
I like the,

2096
00:57:25,521 --> 00:57:25,820
uh,

2097
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:26,970
that's the four 26.

2098
00:57:26,971 --> 00:57:28,730
That one that Brian just put up as the,

2099
00:57:28,731 --> 00:57:28,911
uh,

2100
00:57:28,911 --> 00:57:30,290
the new corvette convertible.

2101
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:30,680
That's,

2102
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,020
it's got a 505 horsepower.

2103
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,780
The last version of this,

2104
00:57:35,781 --> 00:57:35,961
uh,

2105
00:57:35,961 --> 00:57:36,621
this engine,

2106
00:57:36,621 --> 00:57:38,000
I think it's called the ls one,

2107
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,433
but it's a,

2108
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:40,370
might be wrong,

2109
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:45,260
but it's a huge fucking power and
torque that's also in the Zr one,

2110
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:45,921
the same engine.

2111
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:47,450
They supercharge it and the Zr one,

2112
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:49,910
it produces 648 horsepower.

2113
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:53,840
This is like for people who like
talk about like muscle cars.

2114
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:58,340
This is like the greatest era of a
muscle cars in the history of the fucking

2115
00:57:58,341 --> 00:57:59,174
world,

2116
00:57:59,210 --> 00:57:59,990
Nolan.

2117
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:00,291
Yeah.

2118
00:58:00,291 --> 00:58:04,460
The muscle cars that people are creating
now actually can take turns and they

2119
00:58:04,461 --> 00:58:05,810
actually have good brakes.

2120
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:07,790
Like this is a Shelby
Mustang they have now.

2121
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:08,780
That's unbelievable.

2122
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:09,710
The regular button,

2123
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:11,870
they have the three Oh two boss Mustang.

2124
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:12,913
That's like,

2125
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:13,191
you know,

2126
00:58:13,191 --> 00:58:13,491
it's like,

2127
00:58:13,491 --> 00:58:15,140
they're like moderately powered.

2128
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:18,470
It has 440 fucking horsepower.

2129
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:20,480
It's unbelievably powerful.

2130
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,750
Is it the Dodge Dodge
Challenger challenger?

2131
00:58:23,751 --> 00:58:24,584
Yeah.

2132
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:27,340
We went to muscle car though.

2133
00:58:27,341 --> 00:58:29,220
Then we went to drive um,

2134
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:30,443
uh,

2135
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:35,660
Lamborghini's and Ferrari's and Porsche's
on a track for a triplet and the

2136
00:58:36,541 --> 00:58:39,120
dude's just wanted to
drive the dodge challenger.

2137
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:42,360
They would take you out for
a ride and they were like,

2138
00:58:42,361 --> 00:58:43,950
this is more fun for us to drive.

2139
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:44,580
Why is that?

2140
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:45,810
I have no fucking idea.

2141
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,460
But they did everything and they do the,

2142
00:58:47,461 --> 00:58:47,760
the,

2143
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,830
the burnouts where they spin in circles.

2144
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:51,240
Like it's just more fun.

2145
00:58:51,241 --> 00:58:51,551
Like the,

2146
00:58:51,551 --> 00:58:52,111
those things.

2147
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:52,270
I,

2148
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:52,561
you know,

2149
00:58:52,561 --> 00:58:53,560
I think like,

2150
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:55,440
I definitely have driven a ton of those,

2151
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:55,800
uh,

2152
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,910
Lamborghini type cars.

2153
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,290
Those things are fun as fuck,

2154
00:58:58,291 --> 00:59:02,220
but it is a different drive
than like it is really,

2155
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:06,450
you don't feel as loose maybe as you
do as a dodge challenger and dodge

2156
00:59:06,451 --> 00:59:06,781
challenger.

2157
00:59:06,781 --> 00:59:08,520
You're fucking sliding and you're,

2158
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,400
it's fun feeling it.

2159
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:10,230
Yeah.

2160
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:11,041
Well they have a,

2161
00:59:11,041 --> 00:59:11,610
they

2162
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:14,100
have a broad sort of a um,

2163
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:14,670
uh,

2164
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:19,530
you could pick from like a
lower horsepower engine to
like a really ridiculous

2165
00:59:19,531 --> 00:59:20,520
engine and those things.

2166
00:59:20,521 --> 00:59:21,010
Yeah,

2167
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:21,980
you could like ramp

2168
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:25,070
it up and there's a lot of people take
those cars and they ramp them up even

2169
00:59:25,071 --> 00:59:25,311
more.

2170
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:29,590
Like the Hennessy Hennessy makes a 700
horsepower when those I love and that you

2171
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,100
get like those special edition cars.

2172
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:31,840
Yeah.

2173
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,110
Well what they are though,

2174
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:35,270
like the muscle cars of old,

2175
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:36,111
those things,

2176
00:59:36,111 --> 00:59:38,780
you couldn't take corners
in them like this.

2177
00:59:38,781 --> 00:59:40,730
These are completely different animals,

2178
00:59:40,731 --> 00:59:43,880
but the challenger is
still like a muscle car.

2179
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:49,090
Whereas like the Camaro has become almost
like a sports car because they handle

2180
00:59:49,191 --> 00:59:49,770
so well.

2181
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:50,241
Might've been,

2182
00:59:50,241 --> 00:59:52,970
it might've been a Camaro they were
driving now that I'm thinking about it,

2183
00:59:52,971 --> 00:59:55,370
but like we were taking
corners in the lamb,

2184
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:57,740
Lamborghini and like 90 miles an hour.

2185
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,070
Yeah.

2186
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:00,020
Taking corners fucking insane.

2187
01:00:00,021 --> 01:00:00,321
Yeah.

2188
01:00:00,321 --> 01:00:02,200
You can do ridiculous
shit with sports cars.

2189
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:02,511
I drove,

2190
01:00:02,511 --> 01:00:07,511
I flew to Italy for a day to
drive a Ferrari down the coast.

2191
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:08,801
Like I had to fly,

2192
01:00:08,801 --> 01:00:09,461
I had to drive a flight.

2193
01:00:09,461 --> 01:00:10,730
I think I texted you about it.

2194
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:10,881
Yeah.

2195
01:00:10,881 --> 01:00:11,930
Which one did you drive?

2196
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:12,171
Uh,

2197
01:00:12,171 --> 01:00:13,460
I have no fucking clue,

2198
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:14,120
but it was,

2199
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:16,650
I just drove down the coast and I had a
chase car in front of me and test score

2200
01:00:16,651 --> 01:00:16,941
by me.

2201
01:00:16,941 --> 01:00:19,750
They just taped it and I just fucking Lou,

2202
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:21,470
why was so much fun?

2203
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:22,610
Like those paddles up,

2204
01:00:22,611 --> 01:00:22,731
up,

2205
01:00:22,731 --> 01:00:22,851
up,

2206
01:00:22,851 --> 01:00:23,180
up.

2207
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:24,620
Just for lying.

2208
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:24,951
Yeah.

2209
01:00:24,951 --> 01:00:26,030
Those paddle shifters.

2210
01:00:26,031 --> 01:00:27,890
A lot of people are upset
about that shit though.

2211
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:30,350
A lot of people think
that a real sports guy,

2212
01:00:30,351 --> 01:00:33,620
you should shift it manually and that
just because it's quicker to shift it with

2213
01:00:33,621 --> 01:00:34,340
the paddles,

2214
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,260
like you're missing out
on part of the experience.

2215
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:37,530
And I kind of agree,

2216
01:00:37,531 --> 01:00:38,091
man,

2217
01:00:38,091 --> 01:00:40,190
because I like shifting my own gears.

2218
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:41,690
I just do fun about it.

2219
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:42,081
I did too,

2220
01:00:42,081 --> 01:00:44,420
but there's so many people that probably
have never learned how to do that.

2221
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:45,830
They can't learn on a Ferrari,

2222
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,490
and I'm sure that's just a sales thing
because the paddle shifters are much

2223
01:00:49,491 --> 01:00:50,120
easier.

2224
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:50,953
Yeah,

2225
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:51,560
way,

2226
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:52,080
ways,

2227
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,330
but it's not as satisfying.

2228
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,200
It's not,

2229
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,460
it's not that it's hard to shift.

2230
01:00:55,461 --> 01:00:56,061
You're on gears,

2231
01:00:56,061 --> 01:01:01,060
but there's something that's like
mechanically engaging about the clutch in

2232
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:03,770
sliding and shifter for
letting the clutch out,

2233
01:01:03,771 --> 01:01:05,120
hitting the gas the same time.

2234
01:01:05,121 --> 01:01:07,850
So it was something super sexy when
you met a girl that knew how to drive a

2235
01:01:07,851 --> 01:01:09,320
stick and you were like,

2236
01:01:09,321 --> 01:01:10,154
yeah,

2237
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:10,520
like,

2238
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:10,821
yeah,

2239
01:01:10,821 --> 01:01:11,290
you got to,

2240
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:12,530
you're a good dad.

2241
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,500
Especially if it was like a
fucking Mustang or something crazy.

2242
01:01:15,501 --> 01:01:18,330
This dirty pitches out
there driving a big fat VA,

2243
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:19,020
blah,

2244
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:19,620
blah,

2245
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:20,453
blah.

2246
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,030
She wants to drive.

2247
01:01:23,031 --> 01:01:24,770
When you go to the movies
and you've got to say no,

2248
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:27,410
and you've got to not let it be on
top of the first time we fuck either.

2249
01:01:27,411 --> 01:01:30,800
It's very important and then
establish dominance immediately.

2250
01:01:30,801 --> 01:01:35,360
Bert Kreischer that I grabbed that bitch
and let her know the feeling of gravity

2251
01:01:35,361 --> 01:01:38,090
and the density of the
bones and your hips.

2252
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:39,021
You know what I'm saying?

2253
01:01:39,021 --> 01:01:39,854
Brian?

2254
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:41,773
Hollaback.

2255
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:44,230
Ooh.

2256
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:45,510
So bird crusher.

2257
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,460
How much time do you spend on the road?

2258
01:01:47,461 --> 01:01:48,090
Lately?

2259
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:48,990
I'm fucking Dick load.

2260
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:50,760
I'm on the road every week.

2261
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:53,040
I feel like I'm home two days this week.

2262
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:53,611
I'm going to take a leak.

2263
01:01:53,611 --> 01:01:54,331
Talked to Brian about it.

2264
01:01:54,331 --> 01:01:55,164
Okay.

2265
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,080
This is in the podcast.

2266
01:01:58,081 --> 01:01:59,070
It's been four hours.

2267
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,530
Just five minutes.

2268
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:01,920
Brian,

2269
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:02,753
I'll tell you a story.

2270
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:03,420
All right.

2271
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,111
Tell me a story.

2272
01:02:04,111 --> 01:02:04,650
City.

2273
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:05,483
Okay.

2274
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:07,463
Um,

2275
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:10,470
do you wanna hear the story
that I had going to make it?

2276
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:10,951
Oh,

2277
01:02:10,951 --> 01:02:11,281
okay.

2278
01:02:11,281 --> 01:02:12,120
I'll tell you a good story.

2279
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:13,713
It's story.

2280
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:19,710
This is the reason no listened
to the Brian Bird podcast

2281
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:24,510
because I find you funny too often.

2282
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:25,620
Oh,

2283
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:26,370
thank you.

2284
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:27,780
I find you funny all the time.

2285
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:28,231
No,

2286
01:02:28,231 --> 01:02:28,441
no.

2287
01:02:28,441 --> 01:02:29,220
But we like,

2288
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:33,090
like I listened to the podcast and when
I hear you say things that fucking fit

2289
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,610
maybe stopped Joe or like dice,

2290
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:36,121
like you said,

2291
01:02:36,121 --> 01:02:39,000
like two or three things that made me
laugh so hard during the dice podcast.

2292
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,130
I'm smoking in the studio right now,

2293
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:42,030
like a bad boy.

2294
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:43,650
What's in that room right there?

2295
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:46,050
That's a behind me is just an empty room.

2296
01:02:46,051 --> 01:02:48,270
There's a lot of empty
rooms here at the studio,

2297
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:49,770
so I'll tell you this story.

2298
01:02:49,771 --> 01:02:49,991
Okay,

2299
01:02:49,991 --> 01:02:50,390
Brian.

2300
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:50,880
All right.

2301
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:51,420
Um,

2302
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:53,490
so I checked into,

2303
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:58,500
I did Columbus and then I did
right after that I did at Kentucky,

2304
01:02:58,590 --> 01:02:59,110
right?

2305
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:01,020
Chucked into the Kentucky Hotel.

2306
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:01,320
Uh,

2307
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,760
the hotel in Kentucky
and I have four bags.

2308
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:04,261
I shirts,

2309
01:03:04,261 --> 01:03:05,280
I've shirts for two weeks.

2310
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,130
So I four bags a bellman takes my bags,

2311
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:09,023
take some,

2312
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:09,721
I have to take it,

2313
01:03:09,721 --> 01:03:10,554
let them take it in my room.

2314
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:10,921
You know,

2315
01:03:10,921 --> 01:03:11,754
he's going to get a tip.

2316
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:12,721
We go in the elevator.

2317
01:03:12,721 --> 01:03:13,231
He asked what I do.

2318
01:03:13,231 --> 01:03:13,411
I said,

2319
01:03:13,411 --> 01:03:14,244
I'm a comic.

2320
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,370
We get out and second our door opens,

2321
01:03:17,371 --> 01:03:18,940
another door opens and it's a,

2322
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:21,450
it's a older white dude.

2323
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,090
And he walks out like three steps behind
us and he follows me down the hallway,

2324
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:24,901
three steps behind us,

2325
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:25,470
all the way,

2326
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:26,890
all the way until we get
to the end of the row,

2327
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:28,590
the hall where my door is.

2328
01:03:28,591 --> 01:03:28,891
And I'm like,

2329
01:03:28,891 --> 01:03:29,730
is he going to my room?

2330
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,710
Turns out he's in the room
directly next to mine,

2331
01:03:31,711 --> 01:03:33,780
so as he goes to open the door and like,

2332
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:34,830
like put his key in.

2333
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:37,580
I jokingly in front of
this bellman thinking,

2334
01:03:37,581 --> 01:03:38,071
he laugh.

2335
01:03:38,071 --> 01:03:38,850
I go,

2336
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:39,121
hey man,

2337
01:03:39,121 --> 01:03:39,541
if you want,

2338
01:03:39,541 --> 01:03:41,910
we can open up that center
door and hang out all weekend.

2339
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:44,610
And the guy now I like nervous and not,

2340
01:03:44,611 --> 01:03:45,840
and he's trying to get
his key in and he's like,

2341
01:03:45,841 --> 01:03:46,021
no,

2342
01:03:46,021 --> 01:03:46,290
I don't.

2343
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:47,123
I don't want to do that.

2344
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:47,701
And I go,

2345
01:03:47,701 --> 01:03:48,270
well,

2346
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:49,770
it could be cool with
like get to know them.

2347
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:51,670
I said this to this guy,

2348
01:03:51,671 --> 01:03:52,171
say that,

2349
01:03:52,171 --> 01:03:52,991
take it fucking around.

2350
01:03:52,991 --> 01:03:56,050
I'm going to kiss you or so just
fucking around or even bring that up.

2351
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:56,933
We'll just fucking around.

2352
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,630
Just fucking round as a comic.

2353
01:03:58,631 --> 01:03:59,260
Should do.

2354
01:03:59,260 --> 01:03:59,920
All right,

2355
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,420
but what if he says yes?

2356
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:03,340
I don't think he will.

2357
01:04:03,341 --> 01:04:04,210
He's an older man,

2358
01:04:04,211 --> 01:04:05,044
but what if he did?

2359
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:06,340
He's an older man.

2360
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:08,831
I'll tell you.

2361
01:04:08,831 --> 01:04:09,400
Let me tell you.

2362
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:09,730
Let me,

2363
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:10,600
I'll tell you the story.

2364
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,670
That's why get I checked into the

2365
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:16,820
Kentucky and I got to do the Kentucky
and or whatever to Louisville,

2366
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,450
and I have four bags with me and the
bellman takes my bags up the elevator for

2367
01:04:20,451 --> 01:04:21,201
me and I got them on.

2368
01:04:21,201 --> 01:04:22,034
Is this a gay store?

2369
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:22,330
No,

2370
01:04:22,330 --> 01:04:23,163
it's not at all.

2371
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,530
It's really,

2372
01:04:24,531 --> 01:04:27,290
it's one of the funnier things I've done
in a little bit of music to the back of

2373
01:04:27,291 --> 01:04:27,381
it.

2374
01:04:27,381 --> 01:04:28,214
Yeah.

2375
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:29,390
This is,

2376
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:31,420
this is a strong enough story
to close the podcast that way.

2377
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:31,900
It might be,

2378
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:34,120
might be roadkill,

2379
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:34,820
ghosts,

2380
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:35,653
choir,

2381
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:37,250
beggars guild,

2382
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,780
and we're going to play
that in the background.

2383
01:04:38,810 --> 01:04:39,141
Come on,

2384
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:39,441
sweetie.

2385
01:04:39,441 --> 01:04:40,370
Let me design this thing.

2386
01:04:40,371 --> 01:04:41,204
I know what I'm doing.

2387
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:42,570
Trust me.

2388
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:42,751
Oh,

2389
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,650
did you pull up miss B?

2390
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:46,170
You can't kiss me.

2391
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:47,930
You got to stop that.

2392
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:48,631
You know,

2393
01:04:48,631 --> 01:04:49,740
we're playing that out.

2394
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:52,500
We already did that
today with a Brad Pitt,

2395
01:04:52,501 --> 01:04:53,130
Stephen Dorff,

2396
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:55,710
the roadkill ghost choir,

2397
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:56,790
and the song is

2398
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:57,930
beggars guild.

2399
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:00,230
We need to get a desk,

2400
01:05:00,231 --> 01:05:01,200
quad iTunes account.

2401
01:05:01,201 --> 01:05:03,840
Don't worry when you
just order things online,

2402
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:05,490
you know we need real internet.

2403
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:06,383
Hi.

2404
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:07,760
Hi.

2405
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,480
Real Internet death squad one.

2406
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:09,931
Yeah.

2407
01:05:09,931 --> 01:05:10,201
Okay.

2408
01:05:10,201 --> 01:05:10,560
We'll do.

2409
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:11,371
We can do one this week,

2410
01:05:11,371 --> 01:05:12,180
Sarah.

2411
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:13,140
We want to do Fridays there.

2412
01:05:13,141 --> 01:05:13,711
We could do Fridays.

2413
01:05:13,711 --> 01:05:16,380
There was a column because
I had the ice house.

2414
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:16,711
Okay,

2415
01:05:16,711 --> 01:05:17,544
beautiful.

2416
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:18,780
All right,

2417
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:19,030
here.

2418
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:19,870
Is that no,

2419
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,501
Bert Kreischer.

2420
01:05:20,501 --> 01:05:21,420
What were you trying to tell me?

2421
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:23,441
Who are you telling me,

2422
01:05:23,441 --> 01:05:24,274
buddy?

2423
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:25,593
What were you telling me?

2424
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:30,301
Columbus,

2425
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:30,721
Ohio.

2426
01:05:30,721 --> 01:05:31,554
Fuck Nick.

2427
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:35,963
Nick.

2428
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:38,880
I just invented it so I
never heard it myself.

2429
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:41,020
Probably the wrong song for this button.

2430
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:42,480
It's the perfect song fest.

2431
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:44,190
So tell me what happened.

2432
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:44,491
A little,

2433
01:05:44,491 --> 01:05:44,971
a little fine.

2434
01:05:44,971 --> 01:05:46,200
Plus we had a little more volume.

2435
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:51,630
So I check into the Kentucky Improv
and a black dude texted my bags.

2436
01:05:51,631 --> 01:05:52,201
He grabs her bags,

2437
01:05:52,201 --> 01:05:53,760
puts him on the trail trailer thing.

2438
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:54,630
It brings him to the elevator.

2439
01:05:54,631 --> 01:05:55,620
I gotta let them take it in the room.

2440
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:56,700
He's earned his tip,

2441
01:05:56,730 --> 01:05:56,931
right?

2442
01:05:56,931 --> 01:05:57,180
Right,

2443
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:58,013
right.

2444
01:05:58,290 --> 01:05:59,490
So we take them up to my room.

2445
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:00,481
He says,

2446
01:06:00,481 --> 01:06:01,111
what are you doing something?

2447
01:06:01,111 --> 01:06:01,890
A comedian?

2448
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:02,160
He goes,

2449
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:02,993
okay,

2450
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:04,240
and we don't talk.

2451
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,430
After that door's open.

2452
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:06,290
Second word,

2453
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:09,890
elevator doors open the doors next to us
in the elevator next to us to open and

2454
01:06:09,891 --> 01:06:11,640
an older white dude
walks out and follows us.

2455
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:15,300
Any ghosts us down like the whole hallway.

2456
01:06:15,301 --> 01:06:15,931
Everywhere we go,

2457
01:06:15,931 --> 01:06:16,741
he follows us.

2458
01:06:16,741 --> 01:06:18,120
He's going wherever
the fuck we're growing,

2459
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:20,280
but get all the way down
to the end of the hallway.

2460
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:22,820
How far away is he walking behind you?

2461
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:24,510
Three feet behind us the whole time.

2462
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:26,310
That mother fucker unconscious.

2463
01:06:26,311 --> 01:06:27,144
It's awkward.

2464
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:28,530
It's awkward and we're both know.

2465
01:06:28,531 --> 01:06:30,420
Didn't confront him all noticing it.

2466
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,100
So we get to the last
door and I'm thinking,

2467
01:06:32,101 --> 01:06:33,120
is this guy going to my room?

2468
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:35,130
I would assume that guys
try and do something bad.

2469
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:38,870
You did something really wrong going on,

2470
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:39,780
but I would think though,

2471
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:41,240
why would you do what we do it?

2472
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:41,660
What?

2473
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:42,690
The last thing you would do,

2474
01:06:42,691 --> 01:06:43,100
Joe?

2475
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:43,730
Listen,

2476
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:44,630
here's what happens.

2477
01:06:44,810 --> 01:06:45,500
First of all,

2478
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:48,010
when someone is mirroring
you like that three,

2479
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:50,450
there'd being very disrespectful
because they're not.

2480
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,450
They're not just the,

2481
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:52,910
not just following you.

2482
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:56,510
They're letting you know they're following
you and they're doing it in a very

2483
01:06:56,511 --> 01:06:58,070
arrogant way or they're being flirty?

2484
01:06:58,130 --> 01:06:58,461
Well,

2485
01:06:58,461 --> 01:06:59,510
they could be.

2486
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:00,270
There's what happened?

2487
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:01,320
Could be psychotics.

2488
01:07:01,321 --> 01:07:03,080
Here's what happened or what would you do?

2489
01:07:03,081 --> 01:07:04,460
Meet up immediately.

2490
01:07:04,461 --> 01:07:06,050
I would ask them what
the fuck is going on?

2491
01:07:06,051 --> 01:07:06,884
Watch what he does.

2492
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,820
It turns out he's in the room next to me.

2493
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:13,910
So he was going to his room.

2494
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:17,800
So as he goes I was drunk.

2495
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:19,430
See you're paranoid.

2496
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:20,810
Nobody was thinking about it.

2497
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:21,830
Who is scared about life?

2498
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:22,630
I have a lot,

2499
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:23,463
a lot.

2500
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,270
I was thinking about more black.

2501
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:29,900
I knew I was a comic and I wanted him to
nudes know that I knew Kevin Hart cause

2502
01:07:29,901 --> 01:07:30,920
that's what I thought he was going to.

2503
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:31,331
No,

2504
01:07:31,331 --> 01:07:31,730
no.

2505
01:07:31,730 --> 01:07:32,240
Hold on.

2506
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,230
And so the guy,

2507
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:33,801
the guy,

2508
01:07:33,801 --> 01:07:37,440
old guy goes to open his door and
I jokingly now told the Black Guy,

2509
01:07:37,441 --> 01:07:39,020
I'm a comic but I haven't
done anything funny.

2510
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:42,350
So I jokingly look at the old
guy and I go pay if you want,

2511
01:07:42,351 --> 01:07:44,240
we can open up that connecting
door and we can hang out.

2512
01:07:44,241 --> 01:07:45,074
Always.

2513
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:49,621
It gets better.

2514
01:07:49,621 --> 01:07:52,440
It gets better by to the
guys now can't get his,

2515
01:07:52,441 --> 01:07:55,200
cause he's now had panicked him
and he can't get this door open.

2516
01:07:55,201 --> 01:07:55,591
And he goes,

2517
01:07:55,591 --> 01:07:55,831
no,

2518
01:07:55,831 --> 01:07:55,981
no,

2519
01:07:55,981 --> 01:07:56,814
I don't want that happened.

2520
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:57,451
And I go,

2521
01:07:57,451 --> 01:07:57,661
no,

2522
01:07:57,661 --> 01:07:58,261
it'd be cool man.

2523
01:07:58,261 --> 01:08:01,890
We'll open it up or hang out with like
the darkness and just talk to each other

2524
01:08:01,891 --> 01:08:05,430
at night and he can't get his door
open and finding is this door open?

2525
01:08:05,610 --> 01:08:05,941
And he goes,

2526
01:08:05,941 --> 01:08:06,900
I don't want that to happen.

2527
01:08:07,110 --> 01:08:08,700
The door opens before you can close it.

2528
01:08:08,701 --> 01:08:09,750
I stick my head in and I go,

2529
01:08:09,751 --> 01:08:10,584
hey man,

2530
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:12,570
if you change your mind,

2531
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:14,550
knock and scratch.

2532
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:18,200
So he goes,

2533
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:18,710
no.

2534
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:19,750
And he shuts the door and he's

2535
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:20,590
fucking panicked.

2536
01:08:20,590 --> 01:08:21,640
And I looked to the black guy,

2537
01:08:21,641 --> 01:08:22,510
the black guy's gone,

2538
01:08:22,511 --> 01:08:23,380
he's in my room.

2539
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:24,310
Okay.

2540
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:24,671
So I go,

2541
01:08:24,671 --> 01:08:24,971
fuck.

2542
01:08:24,971 --> 01:08:26,140
I did that joke for nothing.

2543
01:08:26,141 --> 01:08:29,820
So I go into the room and the
was putting the bags down and uh,

2544
01:08:29,890 --> 01:08:31,780
he gets done all the
bags and I go to take,

2545
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:33,370
you might want to get
ready to cue the music.

2546
01:08:33,371 --> 01:08:34,090
Brian,

2547
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:34,600
he,

2548
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:37,510
I go to give him a tip and the black guy
looks at me and shakes his head and he

2549
01:08:37,511 --> 01:08:37,631
goes,

2550
01:08:37,631 --> 01:08:38,440
no.

2551
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:38,651
I said,

2552
01:08:38,651 --> 01:08:38,771
well,

2553
01:08:38,771 --> 01:08:39,401
I've got to give you a tip,

2554
01:08:39,401 --> 01:08:39,540
man.

2555
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:42,970
Took my bags up here and there's
no just knocking scratch.

2556
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:46,310
So I look at the black,

2557
01:08:46,311 --> 01:08:46,820
I go,

2558
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:47,450
okay.

2559
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:51,090
So I knock and I scratch to the room goes,

2560
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:57,290
he's on the ground.

2561
01:08:57,291 --> 01:09:00,170
Like so the guy in an extra
room called downstairs?

2562
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:00,440
No,

2563
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:00,740
no,

2564
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:00,981
no,

2565
01:09:00,981 --> 01:09:01,251
no,

2566
01:09:01,251 --> 01:09:01,731
no,

2567
01:09:01,731 --> 01:09:02,061
no,

2568
01:09:02,061 --> 01:09:02,301
no.

2569
01:09:02,301 --> 01:09:02,991
The Black Guy,

2570
01:09:02,991 --> 01:09:05,150
the guy who I told the joke
for in the first place,

2571
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:07,160
I heard the whole thing and he goes,

2572
01:09:07,161 --> 01:09:07,581
no man,

2573
01:09:07,581 --> 01:09:08,061
don't do it.

2574
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:09,500
You got to knock and scratch.

2575
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:12,110
So I knocked his scratched
and the fucking guys like,

2576
01:09:12,111 --> 01:09:12,831
I don't want to hang out,

2577
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:13,460
man.

2578
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:13,960
Bird crashed.

2579
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:14,780
That's rude.

2580
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:14,931
Oh,

2581
01:09:14,931 --> 01:09:17,870

bar or die with a lot of insecurity and

2582
01:09:17,871 --> 01:09:18,800
you're fucking with his head.

2583
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:20,030
Funniest thing I've ever done.

2584
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:22,310
The bed's Kinda bullyish.

2585
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:25,730
You feel bad for that
poor dude ass so bad.

2586
01:09:25,731 --> 01:09:26,130

2587
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:26,491
weekend.

2588
01:09:26,491 --> 01:09:27,960

2590

I know he's listening to me.

2591
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:32,220
Why don't you just knock
on the door and say,

2592
01:09:32,221 --> 01:09:32,581
hey man,

01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:36,091
It was passed.

2596
01:09:36,091 --> 01:09:37,080
That is past that.

2597
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:37,261

through an apprenticeship.

outside and objective observer of your

01:12:46,831 --> 01:12:47,551
own existence.

2685
01:12:47,551 --> 01:12:50,370
And what kind of advice would you give
yourself to get your shit together and
