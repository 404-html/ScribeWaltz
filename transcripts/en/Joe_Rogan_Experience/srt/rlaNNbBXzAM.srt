1
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:10,340
I was packing in the Poconos.
We live more.

2
00:00:10,341 --> 00:00:15,341
We're now and the great boss and the 
dynamic duo of pride fighting 

3
00:00:15,341 --> 00:00:17,270
championships back in the day,
classic fights.

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,940
You guys are attached to some of the 
greatest fights of all time.

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:25,270
We are used to tell him every time a 
single fight to say because at the time 

6
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,120
were 6 billion people.
I go,

7
00:00:26,121 --> 00:00:28,280
hey,
understand too.

8
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:33,580
In 6 billion people just did the 
government dating for this show because 

9
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,510
we love that shows at all to this man.
Mr.

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,100
Rogen,
Bas rutten in many ways saved my life.

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,910
Oh,
it's getting dark early.

12
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:44,330
Yeah,
I thought we're going to go down a half.

13
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:45,940
Nope.
Mara,

14
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:49,130
when Allah wants immediately go down to 
a bus route and saved my life.

15
00:00:49,131 --> 00:00:49,760
No,
no,

16
00:00:49,761 --> 00:00:51,440
no.
Let's keep it positive because,

17
00:00:51,441 --> 00:00:56,441
uh,
my two worlds collided on my very first 

18
00:00:56,441 --> 00:00:56,441
event in pride at Bushido.

19
00:00:56,441 --> 00:00:58,850
One October fifth,
2003,

20
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:04,140
a pro wrestler dose Scottish junior 
member of the guy in the mask and the 

21
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,471
act to.
They have to actually cut out even 

22
00:01:08,471 --> 00:01:09,440
bigger.
I to Vegas Fighting Miracle Cro,

23
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:14,441
cop one.
And can you imagine a mission in North 

24
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:18,730
America would never allow that and yet 
went in.

25
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,890
Boom.
Did you see the recent one with Gary 

26
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:23,890
Garcia?
The rising English Kennedy.

27
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:24,350
I just saw like,
you know,

28
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:24,820
like,
like a,

29
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,480
like a repeat thing,
like a little loop thing.

30
00:01:26,481 --> 00:01:31,481
But she fought and I don't know,
I don't know if she was sitting to 

31
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,530
Bressler whatever she was.
She was hobbled.

32
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,470
She couldn't walk.
Her knees were totally wrapped up.

33
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,580
She was limping from the moment she got 
in there.

34
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,890
This scanning Garcia's towering over 
this old lady.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,930
She just beats.
She swallowed it.

36
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:51,390
I mean it was just a giant Silva taking 
a two by four against Takeshi Secura.

37
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:57,870
Remember big giant Silva two by four.
It was like hit him with at the end of 

38
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,450
the.
The angle.

39
00:01:59,451 --> 00:02:04,451
Yeah.
On the pride fighting championship 

40
00:02:04,451 --> 00:02:04,451
event.
Why did he do that?

41
00:02:04,451 --> 00:02:04,451
It was,
uh,

42
00:02:04,451 --> 00:02:04,780
again,
the,

43
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,820
the marriage of pro wrestling and,
and pride in many ways the,

44
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,910
the larger than life storylines and 
production could lead to things like 

45
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,250
that.
And we sought firsthand the freak fights

46
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:17,360
if you.
It wasn't,

47
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,850
I mean it wasn't a part of the actual 
fight.

48
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:24,851
The fight itself was there,
but you remember allister used to bring 

49
00:02:24,851 --> 00:02:24,851
the,
the,

50
00:02:24,851 --> 00:02:29,111
the.
There were pro wrestling esque 

51
00:02:29,111 --> 00:02:29,111
entrances,
which.

52
00:02:29,111 --> 00:02:29,650
Right,
but a lot of people loved.

53
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,970
But was this a part of his entrance?
This was finding somebody?

54
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,990
Yeah,
this was after the fight.

55
00:02:35,991 --> 00:02:38,490
We remember Takeshi cigarette in giant 
silver right there,

56
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,160
and it was like,
yeah,

57
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:43,770
he had the Dubai for choreographed.
It was,

58
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,850
I think it was.
It was maybe a part of the presentation 

59
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:50,990
and not something that,
like you say,

60
00:02:50,991 --> 00:02:55,991
he wanted to assault someone with a few 
fights for in the early days that you 

61
00:02:55,991 --> 00:02:55,991
were like,
oh,

62
00:02:55,991 --> 00:02:57,080
okay.
That's a fixed fight,

63
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,640
right?
There's a few.

64
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,000
Oh Alicia,
did you

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,570
remember it?
It was the funniest thing ever.

66
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,600
A Coleman was fighting to Catia.
Yeah.

67
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:08,650
They told me there was going to be a.
He was going to get finished at six 

68
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,121
minutes by way of heel hook,
so now the press comes to me and he 

69
00:03:12,121 --> 00:03:12,580
tells me what do you think's going to 
happen in his fight,

70
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:14,380
and so it's easy to go.
Who's going to win six minutes?

71
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:19,381
He'll hook.
Everybody froze because this was before 

72
00:03:19,381 --> 00:03:22,831
the fight.
So they had to change their whole 

73
00:03:22,831 --> 00:03:22,831
gimmick.
What they were going to do.

74
00:03:22,831 --> 00:03:25,960
I went to one and a half minutes now,
but I just thought you future pride 

75
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:29,440
result.
They had it all planned out.

76
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:29,860
They hold up,
uh,

77
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,780
you know,
everything with Takata would say,

78
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,570
well actually I can extend those course.
Yeah,

79
00:03:33,571 --> 00:03:35,350
that was.
Yeah,

80
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,630
that was 100 percent that,
you know,

81
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,490
Takata came into our studio training at 
the Beverly Hills Jujitsu Club.

82
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:41,830
We had white and blue belts a tapping 
him.

83
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:43,750
So it was not like this guy was.
Well,

84
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:46,300
he was just an old time dance.
Yes.

85
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,750
They wanted to.
Again,

86
00:03:47,751 --> 00:03:48,770
that's,
you know,

87
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:52,460
you talk about how pride fighting 
championships at Genesys,

88
00:03:52,461 --> 00:03:53,690
it was that,
you know,

89
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:57,200
bringing the biggest,
the so-called toughest best pro wrestler

90
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,330
against Hixon Gracie,
the,

91
00:03:59,331 --> 00:04:02,800
the mythic,
a falling Tuto Jujitsu fighter.

92
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:07,830
The UFC had a similar but more rational 
approach to it recently with cm punk 

93
00:04:09,621 --> 00:04:11,210
versus making gall.
He said,

94
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:16,211
well,
we'll give this cm punk guy a kid with 

95
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:16,211
one fight,
one amateur fight.

96
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:20,030
I think he had at least one amateur 
fight and one fight in the UFC show.

97
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,040
It's promise choked guy out.
And we said,

98
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,310
okay,
you're going to get a tough kit.

99
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,520
You're gonna get a tough kid,
but [inaudible] going to have to fight a

100
00:04:25,521 --> 00:04:27,380
real fighter,
but you know,

101
00:04:27,381 --> 00:04:29,630
you're not going to fight Hixon gracie.
You know what I mean?

102
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,110
It was just at that time,
nobody had Jujitsu like Hickson.

103
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,300
It's just,
he was just so above and beyond 

104
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:38,300
everything.

105
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:38,300
Yeah.
Unreal.

106
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:38,790
So will be $400.
No,

107
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:43,970
no,
that's a nice round number that they 

108
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,250
always got to wonder who threw that out 
first like they did.

109
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,710
Everyone's such a disservice.
Three 98.

110
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,920
That sounds way more believable than 
perfect.

111
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:56,980
$400.
What's crazy is when you see these tie 

112
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,550
fighters who literally do have hundred 
fights at 20 years old.

113
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:03,570
Yeah.
And fight you got instead of sits on 

114
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,480
[inaudible] who's a,
the lightweight champion on Gloria.

115
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,470
You in fact,
uh,

116
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,270
many years ago in Canada doing Moitai 
on,

117
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,460
uh,
on Tsn,

118
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,620
uh,
the espn equivalent up there.

119
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,990
Same thing when you brought in the tie 
fighters.

120
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:16,010
They,
but they were,

121
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:17,060
as you know,
Joe,

122
00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:19,050
and there's a good documentary,
shameless plug,

123
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:24,051
showtime.
It's going to be showing a documentary 

124
00:05:24,051 --> 00:05:26,321
about a fighting in Thailand.
Didn't moit time where these kids 

125
00:05:26,321 --> 00:05:28,190
literally,
that's how they survive,

126
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:33,191
right?
You start at eight and nine years old 

127
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:33,980
and you're on your way to hopefully 
making enough to eat.

128
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,610
Did you get a new documentary that we're
doing right now?

129
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:41,890
There are people in jail like murderous.
They get a chance to fight themselves 

130
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:42,420
for a pardon.
Oh my.

131
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,430
That's a new show is going to start 
looking at weekend.

132
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:49,160
Maybe the documentary as that Red Devil.
Oh,

133
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,330
what's his name?
The rat suit.

134
00:05:51,331 --> 00:05:52,840
The guy with the horn,
with the horns.

135
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:54,400
Cut Off.
Famous.

136
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:57,920
A famous actor talking that actor.

137
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,170
Oh,
he's also into the gang.

138
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,430
God dammit.
He's narrating it Jamie.

139
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,500
You know it is.
The dude is a star of hellboy.

140
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,030
I got the documentary is called five 
rounds to freedom as well,

141
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,470
but it's narrated by head.
Pull up,

142
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,950
pull up the page,
the page on it,

143
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,040
whatever it is.
Yeah.

144
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,500
Freedom.
Ron.

145
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,800
You Go,
wow.

146
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:26,801
That's crazy.
So what are their crimes that they're 

147
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:28,280
going to be one guy that he stabbed 
somebody in the neck and I go,

148
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,480
Nigeria,
what petty crime?

149
00:06:29,481 --> 00:06:30,140
I go,
okay,

150
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:32,670
I can understand it,
but it wouldn't bring.

151
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,650
Criminal State sponsored rehabilitation 
program,

152
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:41,651
popular known as prison fight is not 
reserved for petty criminals under the 

153
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:41,990
law.
Violent criminals and crew,

154
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:47,050
including those convicted of murder.
Hold on a second piece of this is the 

155
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:52,151
one who was convicted of murder and 
sexual assault had been freed and in 

156
00:06:52,151 --> 00:06:56,561
some cases fully absolved of their 
crimes through their participation in 

157
00:06:56,561 --> 00:06:56,570
prison fights.
Well,

158
00:06:56,571 --> 00:06:58,060
that sounds crazy,
Arizona.

159
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,440
My birthday.
That's even crazier than that.

160
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:05,441
Anybody would allow this thought you 
have to do if you're a violent criminal 

161
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:09,911
is prove that you're more violent than 
the other violent criminals and you get 

162
00:07:09,911 --> 00:07:09,911
your freedom.
That's fucking insane.

163
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,080
Yeah.
I don't think there's a lesson to be 

164
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,080
learned for them.
Results on one point.

165
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,760
Oh yeah.
Ken,

166
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:19,130
violent men redeemed themselves through 
violent acts.

167
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:20,210
That's ridiculous.
Of course,

168
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,850
they think probably a pleasant placenta 
plus becomes a negative.

169
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,960
Maybe they think that way.

170
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,720
Your sister or your daughter or your mom
and then they get out because they beat 

171
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,630
the fuck out of all the other 100 
percent agree.

172
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,390
If you see the trailer,
that's what a woman says.

173
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:37,710
He stabbed his kid in the neck,
killed a kid,

174
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,550
and now his guys going to fight for his 
life to get out of there.

175
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,750
You see,
it shouldn't be.

176
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,810
No,
shouldn't be losing.

177
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,140
So,
uh,

178
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:50,290
back to the $400,
no most likely not the dl number in 

179
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:54,011
anybody's case,
somebody just made that up for 

180
00:07:54,011 --> 00:07:56,770
propaganda purposes.
If they would've said over 400 but just 

181
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:57,780
below 400.
See,

182
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,800
but making it for.
And I love that his son is super active 

183
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,780
now and I love the crone is fighting 
like really top guys now you know,

184
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,270
he's he fuck with Jerry in his last 
fight.

185
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,400
It's a tough fucking Chi.
That's a tough area.

186
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,030
I will always wonder what happened to 
crossly Gracie.

187
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,300
Remember,
strike.

188
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:22,330
That's the thing.
He seemed to be the first Gracie to me 

189
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,930
to take it to the next level.
Become more well rounded and well versed

190
00:08:23,931 --> 00:08:26,060
and whip.
Done well.

191
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:29,330
I think Haji showed really great promise
until King Mo knocked him out.

192
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,350
Right.
You know,

193
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,350
that was a big knockout.
King Mo can crack.

194
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,320
We've got some serious power.
He's a tremendous athlete.

195
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:39,440
Student striking as well.
Huge boxing fan.

196
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,650
I'll never forget that ground and pound 
Kale that he had with Seth Pinsky.

197
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,610
Scary guy.
God.

198
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:49,250
Yeah.
But that the throw the guard to the side

199
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:51,650
and drop that right hand on you like,
oh my God.

200
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,920
It's a.
well in Henderson.

201
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,060
I

202
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,740
mean it's amazing.
Uh,

203
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,610
some at the time I'm,
you remember,

204
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:07,110
I mean he just a Ninja that was one shot
and I told him to do to everybody.

205
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:09,320
He is the guy that when he has a,
you know,

206
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:11,490
when he has a face as a great striker 
and I tell them,

207
00:09:11,491 --> 00:09:13,710
just take them down.
I saw him,

208
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,410
he took me down.
I mean you is freaking animal.

209
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:22,411
Like in training.
My Focus Mitts and my hands would hurt 

210
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:22,770
after I would hold him and he would 
stand on one leg and hit.

211
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,560
I don't have no clue how he generated 
that kind of force,

212
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,010
but he had so much power and I said it,
just take him down.

213
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,440
Scott Smith,
why would you even go with them?

214
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:32,940
The guys is trying to just take them 
down,

215
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:34,920
knock them out on the ground,
and he didn't do it.

216
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,600
Every time at the end of the round,
he did it.

217
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,320
Hit him one time it was almost dazed.
The belt went around again,

218
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:43,530
but the third run the loader compelling 
career for Scott Smith to right.

219
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,730
Hadn't headlining events on CBS major 
network exposure.

220
00:09:47,731 --> 00:09:52,731
I remember what we called the Christmas 
miracle when he came back and knocked 

221
00:09:52,731 --> 00:09:53,590
down calmly and,
and again,

222
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:55,830
the guy who's I think back working,
uh,

223
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:01,040
uh,
what you know has a steel back in the 

224
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,040
factory and you,
it's interesting all the sporting,

225
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,060
such a short period of time.
Of course we've seen the explosion,

226
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:07,860
but what could have been even in,
in with a,

227
00:10:07,861 --> 00:10:09,840
with a [inaudible].
And we saw what happened with kimball,

228
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:12,720
but it's just interesting for me now as 
we reminisce about stuff,

229
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:17,721
how,
how so many organizations had 

230
00:10:17,721 --> 00:10:19,470
opportunities and yet fell by the 
wayside for,

231
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,170
for one reason or another,
a lot of it's self inflicted.

232
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:22,910
Well,
elitist

233
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,980
c was a really hard one to watch because
it was bastardizing the sport you were 

234
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,450
seeing,
they were standing people up like,

235
00:10:28,451 --> 00:10:31,010
do you remember what number that 15 
second rule was?

236
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:37,170
But it was also they were standing up 
and dominant positions like Roy Nelson 

237
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:41,040
and Arlovski kind of incredulous working
for Kamora and they stood them up but 

238
00:10:41,751 --> 00:10:42,280
like,
whoa,

239
00:10:42,281 --> 00:10:43,150
that's crazy.

240
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,100
But then you can understand why those 
Kimbo slice,

241
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,820
you know,
taking what was necessary to bring it 

242
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,090
was the first organization to make it to
two major network tv.

243
00:10:54,091 --> 00:10:56,880
And I think there were some decent 
fighters along the way as well.

244
00:10:56,881 --> 00:11:00,150
Where you Akimbo fan at all in terms I 
know your,

245
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:03,720
your martial arts and that's why I 
respected sit here,

246
00:11:03,721 --> 00:11:06,150
bowing down at the altar of the erudite 
one.

247
00:11:06,151 --> 00:11:09,510
But did you like what Kimbo slice 
represented at the time?

248
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,520
I think to most sites was a tough guy 
and he was a fun guy to watch,

249
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:17,521
but the reality of what he represented 
as a mixed martial arts fighter at that 

250
00:11:17,521 --> 00:11:19,120
time was he was,
he was fairly novice.

251
00:11:19,121 --> 00:11:24,121
Yes.
He didn't really have a ground game and 

252
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:24,121
he really couldn't stop a good wrestler 
from taking him down,

253
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:27,130
but he was a good puncher who was really
good in those backyard,

254
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,620
brought in those environments,
you know,

255
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:34,621
like he was tough for the 99 percent of 
the guys out there and he would smash 

256
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:35,340
guys and he smashed a few guys in mma.
Yeah.

257
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:40,650
And you know what I really respect about
Kimbo said he went on the ultimate 

258
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,770
fighter and he gave a go of it can mean 
he really does make the.

259
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:46,930
Yeah,
it was already a huge youtube star at 

260
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,441
the time.
So he went on with all these other 

261
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:51,391
unknown unknown guys who are wrestlers 
and football players and guys like Roy 

262
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:52,750
Nelson and he handled it like a fucking 
man.

263
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,240
Big Target.
That is a big

264
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,600
target on his back.
Everybody knew him.

265
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:02,610
Everybody wants to fight him.
And the numbers were through the roof 

266
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,950
when he was on and he was a great guy.
Yeah,

267
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,250
he was always a super friendly,
real,

268
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,770
real nice guy.
Always cool with everybody up.

269
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,660
Despite his appearance as he looked like
blue,

270
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,690
the gold teeth,
crazy beer and left.

271
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,040
We had so much fun with that guy.
Good guy.

272
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,250
Yeah,
exactly.

273
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:23,251
And that's why though it seems,
because I think there's the argument 

274
00:12:23,251 --> 00:12:23,251
continues even now in the sport.
Right?

275
00:12:23,251 --> 00:12:24,850
What with a rankings,
right?

276
00:12:24,851 --> 00:12:29,851
Joe?
How come Damien Maia is not getting the 

277
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:29,851
next shot at you?
Tyron Woodley.

278
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:29,851
Well,
keep the money.

279
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:31,810
Fight.
Not fight that Woodley and wonderboy.

280
00:12:31,811 --> 00:12:35,560
Half to read 100 percent draw.
I agree 100 percent,

281
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:40,561
but then I also think dominick Cruz in 
and cody Garbrandt as much as what a 

282
00:12:40,561 --> 00:12:45,421
masterpiece.
But if you look at the backgrounds and 

283
00:12:45,421 --> 00:12:48,421
what's happened with in the past,
I think dominick Cruz also deserves a 

284
00:12:48,421 --> 00:12:48,421
rematch.

285
00:12:48,421 --> 00:12:52,530
I don't agree with that.
I don't agree with that because I don't 

286
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,020
think that was that close.
I think cody clearly won that fight.

287
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:53,710
Green.
One thing.

288
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:58,740
Cody represents what?
The body of work that he's done in the 

289
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:58,740
shore.
Yeah,

290
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,130
I mean he,
Tj dillashaw,

291
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,740
he was an amazing fighter,
but tj has been waiting for a long time.

292
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:07,741
Tj barely lost a fight with dominick was
a razor close decision that could've 

293
00:13:07,741 --> 00:13:11,800
gone either way and then he goes on to 
be half our sun sal and I just feel like

294
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,440
in his position now and then he beat,
you know,

295
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,040
the,
the,

296
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:20,150
um,
lended Linacre shut her down and that's 

297
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:26,330
when there's no exact science,
I guess is what I'm saying in it comes 

298
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:30,030
to,
to matchmaking and putting together 

299
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,030
championship fights and what do you 
market the freak,

300
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,560
the star,
the dominant fighter.

301
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,670
That's why I love the sport.

302
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,420
Yeah.
While there's certainly arguments either

303
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,440
way.
I mean there's an interesting triangle 

304
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,301
between the three of those guys.
I mean there's a lot of good match ups 

305
00:13:42,301 --> 00:13:43,150
that can be made with those guys.
And then also there's Dodson,

306
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,430
you know,
Doug don't ever sleep on Dotson.

307
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:50,460
Dotson might've lost to Linacre,
but I think Dodson when he's on is one 

308
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,130
of the fastest guys in the division just
glued.

309
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,430
I always say,
do the math,

310
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,670
the weight jumps like a freaking spider 
almost.

311
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,500
It doesn't slip.
It's really weird.

312
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,790
And if he catches you,
man,

313
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,200
that finishes.
I mean he's a guy hasn't wait.

314
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:03,940
Thunderbolt.
Yeah,

315
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:05,310
exactly.
Lighter,

316
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,920
you know,
like say the luck of base camp pop.

317
00:14:06,921 --> 00:14:08,920
Well Cody Garbrandt,
Dotson,

318
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,600
others are showing.
Even Demetrius Johnson seems to have,

319
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,340
again,
pound for pound,

320
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,480
one of the greats.
Right.

321
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:20,110
One of my favorite fighters ever.
I think he's becoming more,

322
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,080
not necessarily more aggressive,
but there's,

323
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,250
there's some finish now to,
to his game as well.

324
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,960
He's always been trying to show you 
guys,

325
00:14:25,961 --> 00:14:28,390
but you know,
you find a guy like Ali back off.

326
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:28,900
Yes.
You know,

327
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,970
it's a tough fucking guy talked to 
finish those guys.

328
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,390
Let me think about who he finished.
He finished Moraga,

329
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,830
finished her Gucci with one second to 
go,

330
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,370
you know what I mean?
He's a fucking animals Max out.

331
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,120
Benevidez punch the shit out of pseudo 
stops one route.

332
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,320
That's where really I was like,
wow,

333
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:45,590
this uh,
you know,

334
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,570
it's.
But that's,

335
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,750
I'm hoping like we've seen with boxing,
but uh,

336
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,330
the,
the,

337
00:14:50,331 --> 00:14:55,331
the UFC fan base mma fan base begins to 
rally around these lighter weight 

338
00:14:55,331 --> 00:14:57,820
classes because to me that's a,
that's mixed martial arts,

339
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,090
uh,
at its best.

340
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,120
I always want the WEC,
that wasn't my favorite show because 

341
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,360
these guys had full gas tanks.
Now nowadays everybody has it.

342
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:07,400
But at the time were only the 
lightweights,

343
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,080
lightweights,
and that's why I love that show.

344
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,060
And then when you see butted up like,
hey,

345
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,320
more power to them.
Actually.

346
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:12,800
Fair,
smart.

347
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,320
I think cody garbrandt has a real 
possibility.

348
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:18,290
Becoming a huge mainstream star was a 
handsome guy.

349
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,060
He's a devastating puncher.
Amen.

350
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,250
Vicious striker.
He's charismatic,

351
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:23,870
he's confident,
he's very,

352
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,450
he's very moral and ethical.
You know,

353
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:31,451
it.
A relationship with that young boy that 

354
00:15:31,451 --> 00:15:31,451
had leukemia and to help them through 
it.

355
00:15:31,451 --> 00:15:32,060
And I mean,
it's like intense,

356
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:33,860
intense shit man.
I mean,

357
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:36,650
he's a special guy and that was,
it wasn't leukemia is.

358
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,410
I mean,
he's a special guy.

359
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,910
Stop Shop,
man.

360
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,470
I,
I,

361
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,060
like I said,
we just mentioned the podcast.

362
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:44,740
It's like,
um,

363
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,840
it was almost like he was holding back 
and he said,

364
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:48,860
okay,
I'm going to pull it out.

365
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:53,861
Once I've fought fight for the title,
that's when I really got to show what I 

366
00:15:53,861 --> 00:15:54,200
can do because he looked like a 
completely different fighter.

367
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,570
He was always good,
but this was a whole.

368
00:15:56,571 --> 00:16:01,571
But the way he dominated dominick Cruz 
mentally especially leading up to the 

369
00:16:01,571 --> 00:16:02,300
fight where it appeared that he had 
gotten,

370
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:07,330
you know,
Cruz had gotten under his skin when he 

371
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:07,330
stormed out of the interview,
done.

372
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:07,960
But from the opening bell,
like you say,

373
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:08,490
the,
the,

374
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,860
the,
the taunting and stuff,

375
00:16:09,861 --> 00:16:14,861
and yet able to back it up and,
and show whether it's evolution or 

376
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:19,541
whether it was already there.
A masterful performance man grew up in 

377
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:23,860
tough environments.
And I think that what he said after the 

378
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:23,860
fight,
when I asked him about it,

379
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,701
like,
what does the taunting that didn't 

380
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:27,701
bother you?
No,

381
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:27,701
I love that stuff.
It's like I'm used to that.

382
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:27,740
Like,
you know,

383
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,750
that was one where he's comfortable in.
Well,

384
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:34,751
he was also able to stay real calm in 
that world championship spotlight that's

385
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:36,470
very,
very mature.

386
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,180
Plus you flipped it around,
you know,

387
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,200
he,
he shows crews that he doesn't want to 

388
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,670
go into this battle,
almost like walking off.

389
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:48,910
But then once the fight started,
he started doing it to Cruz and I think 

390
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:48,910
it got to curse,
you know,

391
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,320
pointing at the ground,
doing the little dance moves.

392
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:51,500
Guts,
credit,

393
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,150
cruise for the way he handled the.
Yeah.

394
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:58,280
But man,
like a man not as good as anybody.

395
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,650
Tim Kennedy's another one handled it as 
good as anybody.

396
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,900
Yeah.
Some guys handled it.

397
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,150
Mcgregor handled as good as anybody.
He beat me.

398
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:07,150
That's it.
Know that's a,

399
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,050
that's as,
as admirable,

400
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:12,290
you know,
as I'm putting out the correct game plan

401
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,610
and winning.
You know what I mean?

402
00:17:13,611 --> 00:17:18,611
There's something incredibly admirable 
about a guy who can take a loss like a 

403
00:17:18,611 --> 00:17:19,220
man or a woman,
you know?

404
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,630
I mean anyone who can just accept what 
happened and that's just what it is.

405
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,990
You know?
It's a very unfortunate when you see 

406
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,241
someone that's saying some things that 
don't really make sense like after a 

407
00:17:31,241 --> 00:17:35,051
fight or blaming on other people or 
blaming it on their camp or blaming it 

408
00:17:35,051 --> 00:17:38,290
on an injury and it's just an I,
I think you,

409
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:43,360
you did bring this up and I agree with 
you in terms of when someone has been 

410
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,490
knocked out or someone has been in a a 
very grueling,

411
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:51,520
tough fight.
I don't know why we are forced to 

412
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:51,520
interview them

413
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,450
myself to at times where I'm like,
that's not right.

414
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,140
I remember

415
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:03,300
interviewed Cro Cop after the Gonzaga 
fight when a Gonzaga head kicked him and

416
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,520
he.
I was asking him questions.

417
00:18:05,521 --> 00:18:09,030
He had no idea where he was.
You could tell there was no one home.

418
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:14,270
I mean he had just gotten completely 
flat lined and I'd said to them then I 

419
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:14,270
said,
I don't,

420
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,930
I really don't think we should interview
people after knockout again,

421
00:18:15,931 --> 00:18:18,300
but I dropped it.
We never talked about it again.

422
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:21,770
And then after that one and I was like,
that doesn't make any sense.

423
00:18:21,771 --> 00:18:23,220
So he was out cold and I'm

424
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,560
like you said Alex,
obviously to where he has,

425
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,020
you know,
for whatever reason,

426
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,780
thought what he did is he had a good.
Yeah,

427
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,130
he really didn't,
not really close,

428
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,450
but I.
Yeah.

429
00:18:35,451 --> 00:18:36,410
And that's,
you know,

430
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:41,470
to uh,
unfortunate that I don't see what it 

431
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:41,470
accomplished says anyway.

432
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,840
Yeah.
It didn't make me feel bad too and I got

433
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:47,841
to give them the opportunity and then I 
had to give them an opportunity again 

434
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:47,841
because you couldn't see it for the 
first time.

435
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:49,080
So we had to watch it from another 
angle.

436
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,270
The other angle reveal that it didn't 
happen.

437
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,150
So it was kind of stuck,
you know,

438
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,260
that's not fair.
It's not done,

439
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:01,300
but it's also not fair.
If someone tells you they had a good 

440
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:01,300
team,
you got to

441
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:01,300
Whoa,
100,

442
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,230
whatever.
The fuck

443
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:08,030
crazy.
We saw that he had the gifts and we saw 

444
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:08,030
Steve,
Hey,

445
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:08,030
do this.
And we went,

446
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,450
oh no.
What about the bat?

447
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,880
My introduction to probably my very 
first show,

448
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,620
Bushido one,
our first fight,

449
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,440
Chris Brennan,
Asian Woods,

450
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,950
Woca.
I'm settling in,

451
00:19:17,951 --> 00:19:20,020
getting ready.
I'm really excited working with boss.

452
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:25,260
And immediately there's controversy.
I'm Brendan had to in the arm bar,

453
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:29,300
we saw him tap and right away the 
referee go,

454
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,340
wait,
what's happening?

455
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:35,450
They,
they actually restarted the fight and 

456
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:35,470
seconds later Brendan submits them with 
the Camorra.

457
00:19:35,471 --> 00:19:37,690
So right off the bat,
a double submission.

458
00:19:37,691 --> 00:19:38,260
The Christian.
Right,

459
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,480
right.
Yeah.

460
00:19:40,481 --> 00:19:43,720
I always a lot of great.
How's he doing right now?

461
00:19:43,721 --> 00:19:44,950
Did you hear it?
I haven't talked to

462
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:49,990
tune in a while.
Last I saw him was at a UFC a couple of 

463
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:49,990
years back.
He said Hi.

464
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,100
And I know he was teaching them

465
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,860
Dallas,
I think on social media.

466
00:19:51,861 --> 00:19:56,861
Every so often I see him.
I think he's very successful instructor 

467
00:19:56,861 --> 00:20:00,890
right now.
He's a very good Jujitsu instructor on 

468
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:00,890
top of being a very good fighter.
Yeah.

469
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:00,890
No,
no,

470
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:01,820
that was A.
Yeah.

471
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,100
Well,
it's so many.

472
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,460
So many memories,
man.

473
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:11,550
Second rob all the way back.
Old Doc double a double tap on,

474
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,900
borrowed against us.
Coordinate and Marilla.

475
00:20:14,901 --> 00:20:18,660
Busta Montay.
Even our good friend John said that that

476
00:20:18,661 --> 00:20:20,710
was the biggest.
You know,

477
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,190
he owned up to it too,
but that,

478
00:20:22,191 --> 00:20:23,480
you know,
the guy doesn't make many mistakes,

479
00:20:23,481 --> 00:20:27,170
but that one I didn't know that he in 
the book regretted a greatly obviously.

480
00:20:27,171 --> 00:20:28,340
So.
But uh,

481
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,140
but yeah.
Sorry.

482
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,640
You were saying marilla.
Bustamante yeah.

483
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,980
In the UFC against God dammit.
How the fuck am I not from team quest?

484
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:42,770
Yes.
We just talked about that the other day.

485
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,460
Yup.
Yeah,

486
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,680
he got Matt Lindland an arm bar.
Matt

487
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,380
millen tapped.
He said he didn't tap.

488
00:20:47,381 --> 00:20:48,310
They restarted again

489
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,380
and then he got him in to get to you in 
the next round.

490
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,870
Exactly.
On top of the world,

491
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:54,620
man.
Well,

492
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:58,680
it was such a great rivalry to backup 
private btt and um,

493
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:03,770
and the shooter box man,
it was to the point where they get old 

494
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,320
even walking by each other like,
okay,

495
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:06,730
wait a minute.
What's going on here?

496
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,440
Let's say it was so,
uh,

497
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,470
intense,
very intense rivalry which made for 

498
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:13,470
some,
uh,

499
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,970
you know,
legendary matchups when we're talking 

500
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:16,970
about the way here.
It was giant.

501
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:16,970
I mean,
you,

502
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:16,970
you,
will,

503
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:21,561
you guys,
you guys represented like this wild 

504
00:21:21,561 --> 00:21:21,561
west.
No,

505
00:21:21,561 --> 00:21:21,561
it was just,
it was,

506
00:21:21,561 --> 00:21:22,660
everything was crazy,
you know,

507
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:26,950
that's the thing,
because there were also at the time,

508
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:32,020
these were the best bet,
but you're white whiting was also the 

509
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,270
mix of the what we already talked about,
but we were talking on the way here.

510
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,150
Mauricio Shogun Hua.
Remember 2:23

511
00:21:37,151 --> 00:21:39,910
years old goes through Quentin rampage,
Jackson,

512
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:40,730
Antonio.
Whoa.

513
00:21:40,731 --> 00:21:45,731
Jerry Nogueira,
one of the best fights in pride history 

514
00:21:45,731 --> 00:21:48,010
and then in one night Alistair overeem 
and record to win that Grand Prix.

515
00:21:48,011 --> 00:21:50,590
And you don't say what Jon Jones did at 
23.

516
00:21:50,591 --> 00:21:51,400
God bless them,
man.

517
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:56,401
One of the best.
But Mauricio Shogun Hua beast at that 

518
00:21:56,401 --> 00:21:56,401
age,
man.

519
00:21:56,401 --> 00:21:59,760
Oh yeah.
I mean there was a lot of guys and it's 

520
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,861
almost like I would have loved to have 
seen what Nogueira in his prime would 

521
00:22:01,861 --> 00:22:05,581
have been able to do in the UFC and I 
would've loved to seen what fate or in 

522
00:22:05,581 --> 00:22:07,560
his prime because essentially when 
Nogueira fought fader door,

523
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,950
he was in his prime.
Yes.

524
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:13,000
I mean it was that pre or post Bob Sapp.
That was after.

525
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,940
After he fought a sap at the national 
stadium.

526
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:21,110
But the problem with that is anything 
post Bob Sapp,

527
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
you have to take into consideration how 
much damage he took Bob's hats because 

528
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,901
he got beat the fuck that was dropped on
his head due to compensating.

529
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:33,250
I go,
hey,

530
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:38,251
we got this first death right,
was like optum headfirst and nice.

531
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:41,920
Three hundred and 50 pounds.
It's similar with the monster plex,

532
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:43,300
right?
Our dearly departed friend,

533
00:22:43,301 --> 00:22:48,301
Kevin Randleman.
When fresh off of upsetting miracle 

534
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:50,820
puppy goes and drops off fatal.
And again,

535
00:22:50,821 --> 00:22:55,821
fader,
a million Neko let you say would have 

536
00:22:55,821 --> 00:22:58,201
been very good to see what we had done 
in his prime because even despite being 

537
00:22:58,201 --> 00:23:02,011
dropped on his head,
calmly coolly regrouped and then submit 

538
00:23:02,011 --> 00:23:05,380
randleman with the memorial about a 
minute and a half later.

539
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,400
Yeah,
it was amazing.

540
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,290
Yeah.
Fatal Aurion is prime.

541
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:12,370
She's the one thing that was.
I mean it's actually just interesting.

542
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,340
It's cool to see those old videos and 
wash those old fights.

543
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:20,500
But there's something about like epic 
matchups between great fighters,

544
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:25,501
like did the opportunity of Cain 
Velasquez in his prime versus fade or in

545
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,550
his prime.
I would have loved to see.

546
00:23:27,551 --> 00:23:29,260
That would have been so for all these 
injuries.

547
00:23:29,261 --> 00:23:30,730
I would have loved to see that.
Yup.

548
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,360
Yup.
Yeah.

549
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,000
Who did it?
Well,

550
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,650
we didn't get to see miracle one fader,
which at the time,

551
00:23:35,651 --> 00:23:40,440
I mean that was the most anticipated 
heavyweight fight in MMA history.

552
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,630
Most amazing about that fight is fatal 
and beat him standing.

553
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,130
That's why we.
Exactly.

554
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,130
He is the one

555
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,430
that adapted and beat miracle.
What his most potent weapon.

556
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,370
He's this guy that he.
His striking,

557
00:23:52,371 --> 00:23:55,940
it looks not technical,
but when he strikes it's perfect.

558
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:01,500
There's no load up whatsoever.
He holds his fistdale and from here it 

559
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,720
goes forward.
You can tell when he shot is accurate.

560
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:08,110
Is a member of the entry cost,
but with Antonio Gigolo guarantee you 

561
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,590
the final.
The tournament.

562
00:24:09,591 --> 00:24:12,070
But yeah,
the way he would enter the garden.

563
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,470
I think that's what Fabrizio Verdon did 
this homework,

564
00:24:15,471 --> 00:24:17,590
because remember they're doom almost 
bay.

565
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,160
Well he did.
He baited him when,

566
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,200
when he submitted them and I think doom 
Shaka fight also right when it goes soka

567
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,370
fought fader,
a timer,

568
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,350
the rematch and pride.
Right?

569
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,900
That he was throwing these bombs and I'm
doing the commentating.

570
00:24:32,901 --> 00:24:33,440
I said,
well,

571
00:24:33,441 --> 00:24:35,660
he's really overcommitting.
He should watch out.

572
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:40,820
He doesn't fall into a triangle choke.
And then they brought that piece and it 

573
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,350
put it next to the piece.

574
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,880
Whitey Ford for doom you.
That's exactly what happened.

575
00:24:43,881 --> 00:24:46,750
He was over committing and right away 
they slept on that triangle to,

576
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,490
against tk though was ridiculous,
right?

577
00:24:49,491 --> 00:24:50,140
The elbows.
Uh,

578
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,190
it was a rings though.
There was a.

579
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,310
That was an egregious error.
It should not have been.

580
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,860
I don't remember that.
Yeah.

581
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,920
The,
that's why it should've.

582
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,030
It should've been a victory for us 
there.

583
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,740
No elbows.
A lot of the grads.

584
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,740
The man,
when I think back now,

585
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:10,790
the rule,
I just,

586
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:14,330
it seemed like there was no real rule,
no ground and pound.

587
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,560
Yes.
And they also,

588
00:25:15,561 --> 00:25:16,530
again,
it was,

589
00:25:16,531 --> 00:25:17,570
there was,
you know,

590
00:25:17,571 --> 00:25:22,571
came from old wrestling and then into 
the rings you could hit to the body on 

591
00:25:22,571 --> 00:25:23,250
the ground.
Is that how it works?

592
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,370
Clue.
They,

593
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:30,380
uh,
feel like you couldn't hit to the 

594
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,130
ground.
Weird rule on a promotion that 

595
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:32,130
introduced people to two people like 
fate or Antonio,

596
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,890
Rodrigo Nogueira,
Dan Henderson.

597
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,350
I mean,
they all go babaloo.

598
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,800
Sobrato rings,
uh,

599
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,960
produced a whole bunch of man.
It was,

600
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,140
I wish would have been nice to have 
over.

601
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,530
Our friend joined us for some of those 
fights.

602
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:45,950
I should have definitely made a trip 
over there just to watch,

603
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,240
you know,
because I was thinking of flying to see 

604
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,160
fade or fight against material man to 
ever make it over there.

605
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,830
Oh No.
Not this life,

606
00:25:55,210 --> 00:26:00,210
but I just,
I feel like that's one of the things 

607
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:00,210
that I probably should have saw it pride
in its prime.

608
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,300
I always tell people out 90,000
seats.

609
00:26:02,301 --> 00:26:05,330
I remember Dana,
he came for the first time,

610
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:07,810
but it was the first row.
And I remember when I look back,

611
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:12,830
when the opening started,
I looked back at east with his mouth 

612
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:12,830
open.
He looks around to go.

613
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,550
This is the craziest things.
Parents.

614
00:26:13,551 --> 00:26:15,100
I remember looking at him.
I go,

615
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,760
right,
this is crazy.

616
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:17,990
I mean,
it was insane.

617
00:26:17,991 --> 00:26:22,991
He brought chuck.
You remember drover and Quinton rampage.

618
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,880
Jackson five.
Um,

619
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,470
the but okay,
well there you go though the,

620
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:32,560
the,
the UFC used to have the ramp and the 

621
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,660
elaborate entrances and I know they 
wanted to separate from my other light 

622
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,470
of employment,
wwe and the wrestling aspect,

623
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:41,471
but don't know Bella toward does a 
pretty decent job when their entrances 

624
00:26:41,471 --> 00:26:44,160
and stuff.
Do you think that that is something that

625
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:48,690
could help UFC now or is it or is it you
like the boxing entrance that's pure,

626
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,250
you know,
the sport aspect of it.

627
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,790
Because I think fans in Japan,
man,

628
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:56,670
I mean the production values were 
ridiculous and I think it was,

629
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,120
it added to the experience while it's 
definitely a different thing,

630
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,980
whether or not it's better.
I don't know,

631
00:27:01,981 --> 00:27:03,540
man.
I just like this,

632
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:08,570
uh,
past UFC with Ronda Rousey and Amanda 

633
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:12,470
Nunez walking down the tunnel that I 
like just watching weather all those 

634
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:12,510
guys.
Yeah,

635
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:13,920
I agree.
Give a fuck about fireworks.

636
00:27:13,921 --> 00:27:14,870
I'm not a little kid.
Yeah,

637
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:20,580
I want,
I want to see what someone's face looks 

638
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:20,580
like.
They're about to go to war.

639
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:20,580
You know,
when I went and watched the you,

640
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,210
she,
most of the time,

641
00:27:21,211 --> 00:27:22,350
you know,
it's recorded.

642
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:24,810
I turned my phone off and that's where I
go fast forward.

643
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:27,990
I go to the fights to pick something up.

644
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,280
When you then had to go like,
oh man,

645
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,580
that was like,
I got,

646
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,590
let's take a look at that.
Do you know?

647
00:27:31,591 --> 00:27:36,591
So I'm a little bit of idea,
but that's how it shows you how much I 

648
00:27:36,591 --> 00:27:38,730
wonder in joy it Yoda,
the video footage that they had,

649
00:27:38,731 --> 00:27:43,410
the pride fighting championships and 
especially the one would feed or woke up

650
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:48,210
crying.
That was a tree was amazing for sure.

651
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,240
Like movie trailers for the fight.
They'd show you the tea that the movie 

652
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,931
trailer and they were not allowed to 
show it to the American audience for 

653
00:27:56,931 --> 00:27:57,840
some reason to add this.
I don't know why they weren't allowed to

654
00:27:57,841 --> 00:27:59,410
show the movie trailer part of it.
Nope.

655
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,680
That was,
that was Tokyo TV or wherever.

656
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:03,170
Whoever had that contract,
food,

657
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,700
GTV,
GTV and they get like 5 million bucks to

658
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:10,440
show what was always weird for us when 
you're shows would either be like 4:00

659
00:28:10,441 --> 00:28:11,760
in the morning,
so we'd have.

660
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,680
I'd have guys over my house at 4:00
in the morning.

661
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Everybody be drinking red bull,
trying to stay awake and then pride 

662
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,501
would come on.
Or you guys would have the fights and 

663
00:28:21,501 --> 00:28:22,950
then it would air on tv a while later.
Like later.

664
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,840
Yeah.
I tried to break it.

665
00:28:24,841 --> 00:28:26,240
I was calling all the windows and you 
know,

666
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,710
to see what gambling if we could do 
something with that.

667
00:28:28,711 --> 00:28:30,180
But no,
it didn't.

668
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,720
Cubs win the world series and.
But everybody knew the results,

669
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:35,040
you know,
because of all the websites.

670
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,950
So you just watched to see what 
happened.

671
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:43,620
I combat sports is the one.
Forget football,

672
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:44,260
baseball,
hockey,

673
00:28:44,261 --> 00:28:46,110
everything else.
I don't care if I know the result,

674
00:28:46,111 --> 00:28:47,550
I will watch a fight.
Yeah.

675
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,620
If I know the result,
I'll watch a fight too.

676
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,210
It's just,
I think it's the,

677
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,340
it's not as good.
Meryl Streep?

678
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,330
No,
it's not as good,

679
00:28:54,331 --> 00:28:55,710
but it's still.
I don't know.

680
00:28:55,711 --> 00:28:58,560
There's something maybe because it's 
more digestible size,

681
00:28:58,561 --> 00:29:01,680
but I just,
I find fighting to be something,

682
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,340
you know,
I,

683
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:07,350
I will watch other than if I record a,
a hockey game and I know the score will 

684
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,240
and screw it.
I'm not watching it.

685
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,080
Yeah,
man.

686
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:12,540
I was reading some of the responses to 
Metal Meryl Streep.

687
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,660
She's crying,
just blasted for Olympic sports.

688
00:29:15,661 --> 00:29:19,000
That's what I said.
Okay.

689
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:23,710
What the comedian what,
what in what context do you think she.

690
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,260
My knee jerk reaction.
Same thing.

691
00:29:25,261 --> 00:29:26,460
Hey,
love me some murals street,

692
00:29:26,461 --> 00:29:28,110
but why do you have to trash at my 
mayor?

693
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:31,950
I'm wondering if she didn't even ever 
know what mixed martial arts was.

694
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:35,040
Someone gave her the word with arts in 
it and she made the time.

695
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:36,300
Well,
it's not even arts,

696
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,910
but if football doesn't say football 
arts.

697
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,640
Right.
So let's see.

698
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,190
Went after mixed martial arts because

699
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,400
she said the word arts and then she 
ripped it.

700
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,220
Your right.
She said,

701
00:29:45,221 --> 00:29:47,560
which by the way is not.
They are like,

702
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:48,790
okay,
well what?

703
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:49,630
What Arts,
you know,

704
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:51,160
it's not the art of pretending you're 
right.

705
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:53,890
It's the art of execution under extreme 
circumstances.

706
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,790
Very difficult circumstances,
highly trained opponent,

707
00:29:57,791 --> 00:30:02,791
trying to smash bones in your face.
Incredibly difficult to do advantage 

708
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:02,791
Rogan,
right?

709
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,710
It's artistic.
You can't tell me.

710
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:09,770
When Anderson Silva landed that front 
kick to veto Belfort's face and you see 

711
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:10,810
his legs given that's art,
that's art.

712
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:15,870
What about Joan and on Anderson Silva or
Hook right into the heel hook.

713
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,430
That was incredible.
That was like a movie scene,

714
00:30:18,431 --> 00:30:20,440
man.
Brazilian Jujitsu is art.

715
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:24,220
A brutal piece of art.
When Quentin,

716
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:29,221
rampage Jackson Queer Carto Rona Slam.
Oh my God,

717
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,660
he arches backwards.
Oh my God.

718
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:36,700
It didn't.
Someone actually call that shot a few 

719
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,470
seconds before you saw it coming.

720
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,190
Believed in Christ to hold onto that 
yet,

721
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,190
hold on gotTa,
let go of that fucking thing.

722
00:30:45,191 --> 00:30:46,200
But then the replay.
Don't.

723
00:30:46,201 --> 00:30:48,960
You did see this smash heads.
He goes,

724
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:49,630
well,
but your wife,

725
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,630
why did he hold on?
Who's probably gone anyway?

726
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,770
And even if the young smash heads up,
the,

727
00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:58,771
uh,
the impact was so brutal there a Ronan 

728
00:30:58,771 --> 00:30:58,771
was essentially never the same again.
No,

729
00:30:58,771 --> 00:31:02,920
no,
we never really fought well again after 

730
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:02,920
that fight.
And it was so much potential.

731
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,920
But you know what's funny,
we're talking again.

732
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,480
Paolo filio another gun.
Oh,

733
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:11,090
he went crazy though.
Did you see God?

734
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:16,190
Good Garden.
Was Sassy the evolution of him or what 

735
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,691
he's now doing right now,
he's at the door of the top guys in 

736
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:20,820
[inaudible] 85.
I like it.

737
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:25,850
I need to say about a role now because I
was interviewing a rohde and he had a 

738
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,371
cup of tea.
Japanese green tea was standing here as 

739
00:31:29,371 --> 00:31:29,890
somebody and it was so cool that he kept
his cool.

740
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:31,650
So good,
pushed the thing,

741
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:35,470
fell off and he's sitting and he does 
this and he comes up here at the cuff.

742
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:40,550
He grabbed this school because I know it
is going to go.

743
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:44,320
Just

744
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:49,360
not looking good.
And he brings it back up and he sets it 

745
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,941
down.
Man Jitsu Stud as was Paula Filio yeah.

746
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,580
Paula was one of those guys.
He got you on the ground,

747
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,170
man.
He was a fucking pitch.

748
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,790
You'll do you remember?
Uh,

749
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,060
will you just call it a fight?
We started the radio and Louisa,

750
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,250
for me,
uh,

751
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:08,290
in Bushido want to say it was an to me 
the earliest example for me and probably

752
00:32:09,921 --> 00:32:14,921
one of the best grappling fights I'd 
ever seen in an mma arena member,

753
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:20,310
Ricardo Arona and dean lister and their 
rematch from the Abu Dhabi and we were 

754
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,720
pumping the crap out of it.
It wasn't,

755
00:32:22,721 --> 00:32:25,340
uh,
wasn't the most fan friendly friend.

756
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,670
Hey,
let me ask you guys about this cobalt on

757
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:30,350
my mind because I'm tired of talking.
Thinking about grappling matches,

758
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,480
what did you guys think about Aoki?
How are you?

759
00:32:32,481 --> 00:32:34,660
Okay.
He used to wear those tights and uh,

760
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,110
you know,
when he went to fight in us,

761
00:32:36,111 --> 00:32:38,750
they wouldn't let him wear the tights.
Eddie Bravo and I have talked about this

762
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:40,130
a million,
like

763
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,500
I don't see a problem with him wearing 
the tights.

764
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:47,160
Like why does he get the sweat?
It has more traction.

765
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:53,320
But girls can wear like rash guard tops.
Right?

766
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,940
Can they cover their arms?
Can girls cover their arms?

767
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,070
I don't know.
I don't know.

768
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,690
No,
they should not be allowed to do that.

769
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,710
I don't wonder why.
Okay.

770
00:33:03,711 --> 00:33:06,050
So why do you think he should have been 
allowed to have fun?

771
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,080
But yeah,
when I watched Aoki fighting got to rap 

772
00:33:11,691 --> 00:33:13,250
dudes up.
But it's crazy legs.

773
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:19,520
The tax,
the tax man.

774
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,220
George Grid gels.
ACL.

775
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,530
Yes.
Yes.

776
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:26,640
I'll go roll on your knees.
You Yoakim Hanson.

777
00:33:26,641 --> 00:33:31,130
You wish you Manson when the walk off.
There's another guy that I wonder why it

778
00:33:31,131 --> 00:33:36,131
never came to the UFC when he apparently
didn't want like,

779
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:39,170
you know when the UFC bought pride,
they had the contracts.

780
00:33:39,171 --> 00:33:40,370
He apparently didn't want to come over.

781
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:43,790
Right.
He also has been a ton of war man.

782
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,080
And you know,
he's,

783
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,820
I think he just fought again.
That's what I read.

784
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,380
Or retired by boy from Norway,
right?

785
00:33:51,381 --> 00:33:53,330
Maybe in Europe.
But remember what he was.

786
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:58,331
He was powerful.
I remember he was one of the few guys 

787
00:33:58,331 --> 00:33:59,330
that can actually hurt you from a back 
position.

788
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:04,510
So one guy,
a Russian one time who knocked somebody 

789
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:04,510
out to a,
mounted him,

790
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,650
really laid on his back and he a big 
swing and he wins the fight.

791
00:34:07,651 --> 00:34:12,651
He knocks the guy out.
The guy had mounted him event where it 

792
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:15,080
said that Duane Ludwig broke his orbital
bone when Dwayne was on his back.

793
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,320
Dwayne swung up and crack even the 
eyeball and broke his little hole from 

794
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,380
the bottom.
That which he did the coolest thing.

795
00:34:21,381 --> 00:34:26,381
What I always wanted to do.
When did you know at the Bartow?

796
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:32,890
Yeah,
I think that's important stance on one 

797
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:34,841
leg and then go do that.
I'm telling my students about this,

798
00:34:35,301 --> 00:34:37,280
that you can do this,
but never did it.

799
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,300
Right.
That's an old man.

800
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,320
He was a part he and train a little bit 
with me as well and actually had that 

801
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:45,880
great fight on seeing here.
Let's see it here.

802
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,670
There you go.
Beautiful.

803
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:53,930
Even with talented,
his first fight in pride against uh,

804
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,280
uh,
keep Henson.

805
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:59,330
We've talked about a split decision,
but buddy that show a joe to me maybe.

806
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,820
I mean pride had so many legendary cards
as well,

807
00:35:01,821 --> 00:35:06,821
but everyone always asked me who I want 
to get into pride fighting 

808
00:35:06,821 --> 00:35:06,821
championships.
What do I watch a lot?

809
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,590
I always tell them to start with Bushido
nine,

810
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,150
the tournament where you had one where 
that fight.

811
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:14,250
Well,
the fight with a Hanson and uh,

812
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,220
um,
we just talked about it.

813
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,690
Edwards,
but hobbled.

814
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:21,320
Go me to fight of the year candidates 
and one night against Louise Azeredo and

815
00:35:21,321 --> 00:35:23,300
touch with your copper jewelry,
Dan Henderson,

816
00:35:23,301 --> 00:35:25,910
Gono and shown in tremendous night of 
fights,

817
00:35:25,911 --> 00:35:26,740
bro.
Yeah.

818
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:31,820
Then those are some of the ones that 
kind of get lost or forgotten about 

819
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:38,980
making ensign anyway,
or which who I mentioned because I have 

820
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,801
a funny story with Anson.
I bet you he challenged him.

821
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,070
Mara.
Challenge Enzo.

822
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,470
Let's.
Hey,

823
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,030
let's re.
Let's rewind that.

824
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,290
Shall We?
Oh my God.

825
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,400
Mr.
Mark Coleman and uh,

826
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,390
Kevin Randleman.
We were in a Boston hotel room.

827
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,910
Uh,
this is after pride event.

828
00:35:56,911 --> 00:35:59,640
We don't know which one and a pride back
then.

829
00:35:59,641 --> 00:36:01,260
Love to party.
Loved to experiment like,

830
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,880
you know,
and I'm a good humble,

831
00:36:02,881 --> 00:36:07,881
uh,
innocent Canadian boy who hadn't really 

832
00:36:07,881 --> 00:36:08,010
gotten out much joe and palate.
When we say experiment,

833
00:36:08,011 --> 00:36:13,011
we talked about like my kind and similar
to the buses are more.

834
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,120
Have you ever taken a percocet?
I'm like,

835
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,770
what?
And he's like,

836
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:21,790
have you ever taken a percocet?
So I of course look at it up or pink 

837
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:25,081
color.
How would I want to know what I'm not 

838
00:36:25,081 --> 00:36:25,081
interface.
Come on,

839
00:36:25,081 --> 00:36:25,081
you've got to try it.
I said,

840
00:36:25,081 --> 00:36:25,950
okay,
well why not?

841
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,130
So he gives me,
you gave me three percosets do not one,

842
00:36:29,131 --> 00:36:31,140
three.
So I take these things.

843
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,040
Okay,
fine.

844
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:35,020
Just whatever coleman and randleman walk
in and uh,

845
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,450
all of a sudden,
you know,

846
00:36:36,451 --> 00:36:37,140
I'm,
I'm still,

847
00:36:37,141 --> 00:36:38,310
I'm not feeling a negative.
Oh me,

848
00:36:38,311 --> 00:36:39,240
I'm very impatient.
I'm like,

849
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:40,290
well,
what the Hell is not working?

850
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:42,750
It's not working.
Randleman asked boss.

851
00:36:42,751 --> 00:36:44,420
He goes,
what do you give them in Bosco?

852
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:47,040
I gave them three percocet.
You did well,

853
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,930
and then all of a sudden almost on cue 
it hits me and I ended up,

854
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:52,980
uh,
incident anyway,

855
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,830
was there a with us as well visiting and
I ended up,

856
00:36:55,831 --> 00:36:59,430
for some reason going into my old,
a pro wrestling manager.

857
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:01,260
He'll mode and going right up to incent 
and go,

858
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:03,510
hey,
I think I can take you bro.

859
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,830
I think I can take.
And I'm doing this again.

860
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,990
I'm really just kind of needling him and
he,

861
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,170
he,
he's trying to be nice.

862
00:37:10,171 --> 00:37:10,710
He knows,
okay,

863
00:37:10,711 --> 00:37:12,600
this is the English announcer,
cool.

864
00:37:12,601 --> 00:37:14,760
Whatever.
But I am pushing it because I'm,

865
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,230
I'm impacted by percosets by.
But do you,

866
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,530
are you thinking that you're doing a 
performance?

867
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:20,480
No,
that's,

868
00:37:20,481 --> 00:37:21,340
that's the thing.
I,

869
00:37:21,341 --> 00:37:23,210
I felt like I was,
I was hot.

870
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,200
I was,
I was like,

871
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:29,650
I was out of my mind.
I thought you were going to eat up 

872
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,950
insane anyway.
I don't think I could beat him up,

873
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:33,900
beat him up,
Joe.

874
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:38,130
But I challenged him a fight.
He finally had enough faith in me,

875
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,890
broke my glasses and I got a bloody nose
and I'm like,

876
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,360
well,
now I've got to wear the badge of honor.

877
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:45,360
And I took the picture with him and uh,
an ensign and I'm like,

878
00:37:45,361 --> 00:37:50,361
yeah,
I don't think I'll be doing percosets 

879
00:37:50,361 --> 00:37:50,361
anymore.
I'll stick to that.

880
00:37:50,361 --> 00:37:51,050
The only time they're trained killers.
Yes.

881
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,350
Thank you.
Yes.

882
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,950
And never get it.
Thanks to the good guy.

883
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:56,970
Really good guy.

884
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:03,760
He hit the ground.
He's not gonna.

885
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,120
Do you remember when last?
Randy couture?

886
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,140
Yes.
And He,

887
00:38:07,141 --> 00:38:12,141
uh,
he was one of the first guys I ever saw 

888
00:38:12,141 --> 00:38:13,590
through a really hard kicks to the legs 
from his guard.

889
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,960
And I remember watching that going,
oh,

890
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:20,961
look at this,
because he would prop himself up on his 

891
00:38:20,961 --> 00:38:20,961
back on me,
whip that leg into it.

892
00:38:20,961 --> 00:38:25,030
And he hit randy with some hard kicks 
back boy,

893
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,780
my boy frank shamrock Tomlinson and new 
way.

894
00:38:27,781 --> 00:38:32,310
A lesson at the rampage when his 
brother.

895
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,990
What sentence?
Brothers and the Egan.

896
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,200
Egan.
Oh yeah,

897
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:42,330
there were because of what frank did.
And speaking of brawls,

898
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:46,110
how bout a coleman and Maricio Shogun 
Hua?

899
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:46,650
When,
uh,

900
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:47,080
who,
uh,

901
00:38:47,081 --> 00:38:50,410
went to post,
broke his arm and shoot a saint house.

902
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,320
Phil filled Beverly Silva.
Stepping on.

903
00:38:53,321 --> 00:38:55,280
Phil Baroni said pride was wild,
Bro.

904
00:38:55,570 --> 00:39:00,570
It was amazing.
You guys had like real street or in the 

905
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:00,610
back?

906
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,370
Oh yeah.
Well that just walking into the place,

907
00:39:04,371 --> 00:39:06,340
high ingrained.
She decides out of the blue.

908
00:39:06,341 --> 00:39:08,290
I have no cool way to pull the fire 
alarm.

909
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:13,680
This is before the whole show stopped.
And buddy the extinguisher fell like a 

910
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,850
colored extinguished coggin coming and 
he's screaming.

911
00:39:15,851 --> 00:39:20,851
Yeah.
Everything falls out of the freaking 

912
00:39:20,851 --> 00:39:20,851
ceiling.
Fire retardant,

913
00:39:20,851 --> 00:39:24,510
he released it,
he released in the sky and the show went

914
00:39:24,511 --> 00:39:24,990
on.
Anyway,

915
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:30,900
he's just walking and suddenly he 
separates himself from the group and he 

916
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,080
hits them and you don't fight that 
night.

917
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:33,110
What's?
Yeah,

918
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:35,860
that was the first time when he said,
well,

919
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,960
the sheet was the first time five 
members of the Gracie family had ever 

920
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:43,480
competed on the St Cordova.
Daniel by marriage.

921
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,110
Right.
So you had,

922
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,710
you had hedsel and Carlos.
Nancy had Henzel highend whoa.

923
00:39:47,711 --> 00:39:49,330
Dorrigo.
Daniel.

924
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,480
And who was the other one?
I'm missing disrespect,

925
00:39:52,481 --> 00:39:54,390
but the Daniel thing is a weird one.

926
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,460
Is that your last name?
Where's it your wife's last name?

927
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,690
What in the fuck is going on here,
sir?

928
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:05,560
And went to a boxing gym one.
I could use the boxing the during,

929
00:40:05,561 --> 00:40:10,561
you know,
to train and the guy comes to me and he 

930
00:40:10,561 --> 00:40:13,231
says,
if you want I can teach you some 

931
00:40:13,231 --> 00:40:13,231
groundwork.
She,

932
00:40:13,231 --> 00:40:13,231
she didn't want me.
Gracie,

933
00:40:13,231 --> 00:40:15,040
I see your gray.
She is married to a gracie.

934
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:19,830
Oh,
how strange.

935
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:25,740
And a button.
But that night high and took the mic 

936
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,501
after and went off.
I mean using every expletive known 

937
00:40:28,501 --> 00:40:32,731
demand just snapped because of the 
controversy and well,

938
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:37,810
high end was the craziest of all.
And we had some good times with him.

939
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,890
Oh real good time to what?
I eat.

940
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,630
A tortured soul,
but at the toss anyway.

941
00:40:43,631 --> 00:40:45,500
Always a good one of the few.
Not few,

942
00:40:45,501 --> 00:40:50,501
a lot of guys,
but he always went out of his way to 

943
00:40:50,501 --> 00:40:50,501
make me.
I mean,

944
00:40:50,501 --> 00:40:51,910
you're a legend,
but to make the announcer feel good,

945
00:40:51,911 --> 00:40:53,220
he always came up more.
Hello,

946
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,220
good to see you.
And well,

947
00:40:54,221 --> 00:40:59,221
once you get old,
uh,

948
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,410
the bounces,
Dallas randleman body,

949
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,070
the very first New Year's Eve we spent 
in Japan for shockwave,

950
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,280
it was you,
Kevin Randleman highend gracie winter 

951
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,280
because he knew he is the one that made 
the most sense.

952
00:41:27,221 --> 00:41:30,270
Was this guy you were the one that kept 
the peace because Kevin was,

953
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,830
was losing his mind and even hiring 
gracie kept saying,

954
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,040
don't worry,
we'll be

955
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,700
okay.
And I'm like,

956
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:35,240
why?
He goes,

957
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,560
just trust me.
We're okay.

958
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:38,600
And I swear to God,
I thought he might've had a gun,

959
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,060
but what do you buddy buddy buddy saying
like,

960
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,640
well that's going to be okay about.
Okay.

961
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:46,400
So he bought some weed from someone 
bounces there and,

962
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,900
and,
and I didn't look because,

963
00:41:47,901 --> 00:41:48,360
you know,
it's,

964
00:41:48,361 --> 00:41:49,430
it's,
it's felony there.

965
00:41:49,431 --> 00:41:52,130
So I just get it and we walk off and 
while we will walk off,

966
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,380
we realized that I pick it out.
I said,

967
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:55,880
oh,
that is not enough.

968
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,770
So I go back and I say,
guys,

969
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,030
that's not enough.
You need to get me more.

970
00:41:59,031 --> 00:41:59,480
And he goes,
no,

971
00:41:59,481 --> 00:42:01,580
that's not going happen.
And he has this attitude.

972
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,180
I said,
okay,

973
00:42:02,181 --> 00:42:07,181
well let me do it different.
I'm going to be back in 10 minutes and 

974
00:42:07,181 --> 00:42:07,181
we're going to be back in 10 minutes.
And then,

975
00:42:07,181 --> 00:42:08,360
uh,
it better be here.

976
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,830
So we walk around,
we thought,

977
00:42:09,831 --> 00:42:11,390
you know,
maybe we should look it up,

978
00:42:11,391 --> 00:42:14,360
at least as we relax and we're in this 
weird,

979
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:17,000
what is it,
a mailbox just like,

980
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:20,810
it's,
it's a complex.

981
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:26,170
And suddenly I'm reading and starts 
jumping up and she start getting angry 

982
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:31,270
and he hits a mailbox.
Ryan stocks and I'll try to keep this 

983
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:31,270
book.
He's guys down and I go,

984
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:31,270
no,
no,

985
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:32,000
no,
you guys relax.

986
00:42:32,001 --> 00:42:33,620
Relax.
I just to shut up my friend.

987
00:42:33,621 --> 00:42:36,280
I say to write and right,
go talk to me.

988
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:37,670
Like this was saying,
come on man.

989
00:42:37,671 --> 00:42:40,760
Are you really doing this right now?
Let we get this whole fight goes on.

990
00:42:40,761 --> 00:42:41,060
I said,
no,

991
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:42,580
no,
we got to stay relaxed.

992
00:42:42,581 --> 00:42:44,660
You smoke a little weed,
we're going to go back.

993
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:50,140
Finally everybody calmed down.
We go back and these guys probably call 

994
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:50,310
somebody,
but oh no,

995
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,110
no.
First of all,

996
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,450
these big guys.

997
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,800
And I walk over and say,
Oh,

998
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:57,500
so um,
we need to right now and they say all we

999
00:42:57,501 --> 00:42:59,540
need to wait to,
because they're bringing it right now.

1000
00:42:59,541 --> 00:43:02,390
So right away already we're looking back
at sure enough,

1001
00:43:02,391 --> 00:43:07,391
there's two big guys coming.
Also same clothes as they have and you 

1002
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:09,620
can see them very sturdy walking up to 
us and as soon as they see us,

1003
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:12,880
they make a one 80 and it talked back 
into fold.

1004
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:16,010
Goes from the guy and I go,
those are the guys calling you right now

1005
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:17,660
telling you you got to give it up.
And he goes,

1006
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,210
he opens the phone and the guy and he 
says,

1007
00:43:20,211 --> 00:43:25,211
okay,
and he puts it down and he gave us a 

1008
00:43:25,211 --> 00:43:26,741
whole mountain founders.
It was right over a movie man.

1009
00:43:27,891 --> 00:43:32,891
It was hilarious.
But the whole altercation when 

1010
00:43:32,891 --> 00:43:32,891
everything,
everybody started jumping.

1011
00:43:32,891 --> 00:43:33,090
That's what Quintin left.
Yes.

1012
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:40,160
We have a great times.
Great Times.

1013
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:41,480
Yeah.
Crazy Times.

1014
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,250
Just a good time.
Yep.

1015
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:48,370
How,
how much of a presence was the whole 

1016
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:48,740
Yakuza thing while you guys were there?
Like how?

1017
00:43:48,741 --> 00:43:52,130
How aware of you guys have it where you 
guys know?

1018
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:57,140
I know I was nobody.
Nobody would notice this launch and 

1019
00:43:57,351 --> 00:43:58,670
drugs.
They don't do anything like that,

1020
00:43:58,671 --> 00:44:01,920
but real estate.
You saw people sitting down there.

1021
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:05,450
Okay.
You said they were missing fingers.

1022
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:14,240
Crazy.
That was where Masato boxer was 

1023
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,130
traveling into your organs.
They're all a strip club and this guy 

1024
00:44:18,261 --> 00:44:22,190
sits there and I'm with long hair and he
comes over to me and says,

1025
00:44:22,191 --> 00:44:23,120
hey,
how you doing?

1026
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:26,160
Like a little feminine and really weird.
You've got to be the biggest fan.

1027
00:44:26,161 --> 00:44:27,100
Are you be financial?
Oh,

1028
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,610
now we got this crazy guy here,
right?

1029
00:44:28,611 --> 00:44:31,530
That I had no clue what to think.
And um,

1030
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:31,900
he said,

1031
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:32,880
oh,
you're a great fighter.

1032
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:37,881
You want to know what I do?
And he takes his shirt off and it's all 

1033
00:44:37,881 --> 00:44:37,881
padded up and people start literally 
leaving the place there.

1034
00:44:37,881 --> 00:44:40,340
And I realized he's yogurts are right.
So we started talking.

1035
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:43,470
I was talking about a n n,
a n a to that.

1036
00:44:43,471 --> 00:44:45,240
I wanted them this color.
I said,

1037
00:44:45,241 --> 00:44:50,241
but in America it's hard to find at that
time people only wanted to use black 

1038
00:44:50,241 --> 00:44:50,241
ink.
And he says,

1039
00:44:50,241 --> 00:44:50,241
no,
that's not hard at all.

1040
00:44:50,241 --> 00:44:52,230
Why don't you come tomorrow morning and,
uh,

1041
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,770
I can do this for you.
So the next day he and I,

1042
00:44:55,771 --> 00:44:59,070
we go to this dungeon,
like five stories under the ground.

1043
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:02,940
It was the weirdest place.
We opened the door,

1044
00:45:02,941 --> 00:45:07,941
there is a cage would have back that 
Masato which indicates two dobermans and

1045
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,580
fly up against the thing.
It's like this human skulls everywhere.

1046
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:19,790
This pictures of books killing people.
This guy taught me and he starts 

1047
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:20,720
screaming and older people are getting 
to to it.

1048
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:25,721
At that moment.
They all get up and they run out the 

1049
00:45:25,721 --> 00:45:28,141
displays.
They locked the door and I look at 

1050
00:45:28,141 --> 00:45:28,141
myself,
I'm like,

1051
00:45:28,141 --> 00:45:28,141
Ooh,
you know,

1052
00:45:28,141 --> 00:45:30,060
because this is a really weird 
situation.

1053
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:33,420
But no,
he wasn't.

1054
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,410
He did a great work,
you know,

1055
00:45:34,411 --> 00:45:35,790
but it was.
He started looking.

1056
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,360
We made it big picture.
Take a video of you.

1057
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:44,361
I'm going to,
because I have a skull with a bullet 

1058
00:45:44,361 --> 00:45:47,031
hole in there.
Record an audio will as well because 

1059
00:45:47,031 --> 00:45:51,290
there was a cage where Masato used to 
kickbox deadline,

1060
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,990
so he would train in a cage in a 
basement.

1061
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,910
Well,
five stories below.

1062
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:59,310
We kept going down.
It was the craziest thing.

1063
00:45:59,311 --> 00:46:01,880
If you think about they have,
you know,

1064
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:06,890
you go like that with the Dobermans in 
their regular trading joe.

1065
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:12,400
But that's,
that's what the guy said that it was 

1066
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,460
Masato me may have even maybe had an 
interest in Masato fought cool.

1067
00:46:14,461 --> 00:46:15,510
Vince Phillips,
who?

1068
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,990
Vince Phillips,
American boxing champion,

1069
00:46:19,991 --> 00:46:20,870
the boxer,
right?

1070
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:24,630
And he went over and fought Masato,
Masato lift those legs.

1071
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:29,740
Chagas animal at that time.
I mean even against the Dutch guy.

1072
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:36,210
So you can find Masato versus weekends.
Phillips is really interesting to see 

1073
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:36,760
you lift those legs up like a Christmas 
tree box.

1074
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:41,800
Top flight.
American boxer fight against a kickboxer

1075
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,000
prime max.
Two thousand three.

1076
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:46,840
Yeah.
But you know,

1077
00:46:46,841 --> 00:46:51,841
in your.
Just accommodating my earl phillips in 

1078
00:46:51,841 --> 00:46:52,410
his defense,
he was beyond his privacy.

1079
00:46:52,411 --> 00:46:54,660
His body had started to fade.
Well,

1080
00:46:54,661 --> 00:46:59,661
but he,
that he was kicking kicked across the 

1081
00:46:59,661 --> 00:47:01,881
legs.
But who was it that took one kick and 

1082
00:47:01,881 --> 00:47:02,440
got out of the ring?
Ray Mercer reimbursing,

1083
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,790
knocked down,
but mercer was a with the Kimbo when the

1084
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,800
MMA thing.
But it was the fighter winter,

1085
00:47:07,801 --> 00:47:11,070
Japan,
the American boxer and took one kick and

1086
00:47:11,071 --> 00:47:12,410
stopped.
Got Out of the rain.

1087
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:13,070
Came on,
right?

1088
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:13,950
Yeah.
Yeah.

1089
00:47:13,951 --> 00:47:16,820
It was more not more sense.
Nah,

1090
00:47:16,821 --> 00:47:17,750
I forgot.
No,

1091
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:18,630
I,
uh,

1092
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,160
yeah.
Similar.

1093
00:47:20,161 --> 00:47:20,580
Yeah.
Yeah.

1094
00:47:20,581 --> 00:47:25,581
It was a blonde guy.
But look at Masada was awesome sense.

1095
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:30,120
Doesn't really helpful to the kids and

1096
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:33,220
massage.
I was going across to cross the arms and

1097
00:47:33,221 --> 00:47:36,190
then across the back leg to rob came and
style.

1098
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:41,460
He did a lot of that and he just moved a
lot and just kick those legs like every 

1099
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:45,181
time we there.
You see Phillips is already starting to 

1100
00:47:45,181 --> 00:47:45,181
wear down and Masato was a good boxer to
men.

1101
00:47:45,181 --> 00:47:47,260
It's like you couldn't deny his hands.
I mean,

1102
00:47:47,261 --> 00:47:48,820
he might not have been the same box with
Vince.

1103
00:47:48,821 --> 00:47:51,250
Phillips was in prime.
We're all those leg kicks.

1104
00:47:51,251 --> 00:47:52,990
It makes such a difference.
Do you remember?

1105
00:47:52,991 --> 00:47:56,050
Go Me and Paul over at shockwave.
Uh,

1106
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:01,500
I thought that was some of the best mma 
boxing bus we'd seen at that time would 

1107
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,480
really.
And he goes down.

1108
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:09,330
He just couldn't get up.
Did you remember that film?

1109
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:13,070
He knocked him down.
What about her hair?

1110
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,310
We're taught off as well,
Sergei.

1111
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,400
We're taught early in pride show.

1112
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:21,400
Good box.
Everyone has that debate and argument 

1113
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:21,400
about,
oh,

1114
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:21,400
boxing.
How would they do it?

1115
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:25,900
We know it's two different sports,
but when it comes to that aspect of MMA,

1116
00:48:25,901 --> 00:48:29,050
the boxing will start.
Gameplan indicate one surgeon,

1117
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:32,680
he had quite a few [inaudible] and then 
recently got back into mma,

1118
00:48:32,681 --> 00:48:33,220
right.
Didn't,

1119
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:38,230
he didn't do,
but he got clipped.

1120
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,960
Complete animal guy.
He used to train the fader.

1121
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:45,961
I remember all the way back.
That was one big group because that 

1122
00:48:45,961 --> 00:48:47,170
remembered a split at the time and 
watching what happened to him.

1123
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:49,710
You know,
he was a great guy to illustrate.

1124
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,780
Funny,
Nice Guy.

1125
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:54,160
One of the scariest stoppages I oversaw 
was um,

1126
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:57,400
uh,
was against semi shelt.

1127
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:02,820
Do you remember when he mounted semi 
shelter and got on top of them and like 

1128
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:06,961
a mounted triangle and start smashing 
Aratana punching them.

1129
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:08,350
Whoa.
Whoa,

1130
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:08,980
Whoa,
whoa.

1131
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:13,990
Hey everybody.
He's just punching them in one eye over 

1132
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:13,990
and over and over.
I remember that.

1133
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:14,680
That was sent me.
Shit,

1134
00:49:14,681 --> 00:49:16,900
man.
Such a physical.

1135
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:22,980
He just didn't have the ground round 
exactly with Keratin on right then.

1136
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,190
And Keratan off.
Just took him onto.

1137
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:30,210
I mean that was back when she sent me,
was beating everybody in key with that 

1138
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:33,541
long Friday.
Crazy at the time.

1139
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:39,120
The first time I sold for change it,
I was commentating this fight in the 

1140
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,780
Ukraine and uh,
it was a while ago.

1141
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,940
That was a really.
Did the whole trip was a wild trip.

1142
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,760
Oscar Charlie Anzalone,
you know the folks from Vegas,

1143
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,360
um,
but he,

1144
00:49:47,361 --> 00:49:50,470
he put in an eight men tournament.
He was the lightest guys,

1145
00:49:50,471 --> 00:49:53,650
like under 90 pound tournament and he 
destroyed all these guys.

1146
00:49:53,651 --> 00:49:55,960
I think the lightest guy,
he fought to a supple violence.

1147
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:59,640
That was the lie.
This guy at two to 3:30.

1148
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:01,180
It was insane.
I mean,

1149
00:50:01,181 --> 00:50:03,340
do I need just knocked everybody out and
I go like,

1150
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:06,310
this Chechen guy gets a pretty good.

1151
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:12,570
I remember he fought on this big giant 
matt once they did something that was 

1152
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:14,980
almost like they made it up a basketball
court and he fought on it.

1153
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:20,800
It's an interesting thing,
but I've been bringing this up a lot 

1154
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:20,800
lately.
I really think mma we'd be better off of

1155
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,920
the largest surface and no cage,
just like a basketball court,

1156
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,680
just like that site.
Welford sightlines definitely.

1157
00:50:27,681 --> 00:50:32,010
I agree with you and teach us.
What about what came up against the kid?

1158
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:38,040
That's cool.
Metamorris type fighting surface for 

1159
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:38,040
MMA.
I don't weld.

1160
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,430
The problem metamorphosis is elevated,
right?

1161
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:40,640
Like you don't want to do.
It's fallen.

1162
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:40,990
No,
no,

1163
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:41,570
no,
exactly.

1164
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:46,100
But that kind of like that'll do space.
I think a big open space on the ground,

1165
00:50:46,101 --> 00:50:51,101
just mad at ground level.
You almost to let a cage though to had 

1166
00:50:51,101 --> 00:50:53,810
they had the tip for cameras is not 
gonna work.

1167
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:58,840
It's gonna be very hard for the audience
to see as well because it's all one 

1168
00:50:58,840 --> 00:50:59,850
level,
but that's in a lot of people.

1169
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:02,360
Accord is all one level.
Yeah,

1170
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:03,140
that's true.
Yeah.

1171
00:51:03,141 --> 00:51:08,141
A lot of people say though when they go 
to an event that they are watching the 

1172
00:51:08,141 --> 00:51:11,291
screen because of that,
but I think you could do it on a 

1173
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:12,110
basketball court,
but just think that it.

1174
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:14,900
It dates still see here at a basketball 
boards,

1175
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:18,200
the people on the floor,
they can at least see the cage,

1176
00:51:18,201 --> 00:51:20,310
the bottom of the cage,
but if somebody sits in front of him,

1177
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:21,820
they can't see anything.
Well,

1178
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:26,850
if you have tiered seating,
if you have like stadium style seating 

1179
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:30,311
and then there's be a front row and then
there's gotta be some sort of dividing 

1180
00:51:30,311 --> 00:51:31,010
line because you don't want to get run 
over if you're in the front row.

1181
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:34,430
Some fucking gorilla.
It's like wrestling a college wrestling.

1182
00:51:34,431 --> 00:51:35,100
Yeah.
Yeah.

1183
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:39,740
If a referral comes piling through and 
slams on your girlfriend and breaks both

1184
00:51:39,741 --> 00:51:42,560
her legs or Travis Browne,
it was in the front row.

1185
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:44,280
Yes,
it could be a problem,

1186
00:51:44,281 --> 00:51:45,400
but it could be an issue.
The front row,

1187
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:48,080
it could be an issue,
but as long as they keep people from bug

1188
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:51,050
piling into the crowd because if you 
could have that,

1189
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,960
you would be able to watch something 
happened with no cages.

1190
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:56,720
There's one thing that I see over and 
over again,

1191
00:51:56,721 --> 00:52:01,721
like it's a very grueling aspect to mma 
when guys are tied up against the cage 

1192
00:52:01,721 --> 00:52:05,411
and they're clenching and it throw a 
nice the body and they're throwing 

1193
00:52:05,411 --> 00:52:08,440
elbows and titan is a grueling sort of,
but it's also grueling in an artificial 

1194
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:12,731
way like it's artificial that they're 
pressed up against something and that 

1195
00:52:12,731 --> 00:52:14,060
that cage becomes a factor in the fight.

1196
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:19,200
What it doesn't have to be a factor.
I think the more factors you can remove 

1197
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,800
extraneous factors outside of your 
opponent,

1198
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:26,801
the better to fall is an extraneous 
factor and you could use it to your 

1199
00:52:26,801 --> 00:52:28,100
advantage.
Be pressed people up,

1200
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:33,101
he'd take them down with it.
There's a lot of things you could do to 

1201
00:52:33,101 --> 00:52:34,520
get back up from it,
but I really feel like it's an automatic

1202
00:52:34,521 --> 00:52:37,490
brake or is that taking too much that 
away for the fight.

1203
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:38,900
If you go against the fence,
I stopped.

1204
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:44,020
I'm still going to have electricity on 
the fence that that would be something I

1205
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:53,470
championships,
but it will hold people who are total 

1206
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,651
savages.
They would hold someone against the 

1207
00:52:56,651 --> 00:52:56,651
fence,
see who could take the pain,

1208
00:52:56,651 --> 00:52:59,951
the most bold jolted to the difference 
going from a former ring to a cage is 

1209
00:53:08,421 --> 00:53:13,421
already huge because there's no corner,
so I can only imagine that that means 

1210
00:53:13,421 --> 00:53:13,520
she'd know the wool walking no more.

1211
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,070
Everything that Bernard Hopkins knockout
last week,

1212
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:21,920
not last week,
last month or so,

1213
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:26,760
went through that ring like that and 
fell down on his head.

1214
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:29,280
I was like,
how do they not protect against this?

1215
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:34,320
We have to remember there was a real 
pride frank to already there with their 

1216
00:53:41,521 --> 00:53:43,560
numbers on their back.
Remember this kid that was.

1217
00:53:43,561 --> 00:53:46,800
But that was always one of the problems 
about the pride ring,

1218
00:53:46,801 --> 00:53:48,900
right?
You were forced to break lion fight too.

1219
00:53:48,901 --> 00:53:51,330
I was watching one,
a car Hollenbeck's fights and he,

1220
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,230
he fell out of the ring and smacked his 
knees on the edge of the,

1221
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,220
uh,
apron as he was falling out.

1222
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:01,340
I remember Marvin Eastman falling out of
a ring of Vancouver almost seriously 

1223
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,250
hurting himself as well before he got 
the goats for Jonah.

1224
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:08,130
Why don't they have like a netting in 
between the ropes to keep prevent people

1225
00:54:08,131 --> 00:54:10,290
from falling through?
It still serves the same purpose.

1226
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:11,200
You would think so,
right?

1227
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:11,970
Yeah.
Well,

1228
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:16,980
more vertical rope to swell in between.
Do you remember the old valley to doe 

1229
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:20,950
fight between Palae and Chuck Liddell?
Yeah.

1230
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:25,990
They had a net under the first rope.
The bottom row was shoving them in there

1231
00:54:28,411 --> 00:54:30,660
and they were bare knuckle fighting 
chocolates,

1232
00:54:30,661 --> 00:54:32,190
punched him in the face,
bare knuckle,

1233
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:37,610
and he couldn't escape.
He would just tucked in there like a 

1234
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:39,390
fish fuck beat out of them.
Jesus Christ.

1235
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:42,810
Gary Goodrich with the Pedro.
When he went to squeeze the pillow does.

1236
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,940
Yeah.
He went right into his pants and grabbed

1237
00:54:44,941 --> 00:54:47,910
a hold of his junk and crushed his balls
in his hand and he had some grit.

1238
00:54:47,911 --> 00:54:48,600
Man,
I can tell you,

1239
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:55,360
I listened to a hotel one time and 
getting a massage and while I'm getting 

1240
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,540
the massage to the girl that put a towel
over your face,

1241
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,850
right?
So I don't know who's massaging me.

1242
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:04,850
And suddenly the massage gets stronger 
and stronger and stronger as she starts 

1243
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,810
crushing my shins.
You know,

1244
00:55:06,811 --> 00:55:08,670
like really hot,
I throw the towel and go,

1245
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:10,450
hey,
and it's a big data,

1246
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:15,520
good risk taking over to massage my 
legs.

1247
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,430
So I know he has a grip.
Yeah.

1248
00:55:19,431 --> 00:55:21,280
What a crazy thing that was a rule.
You,

1249
00:55:21,281 --> 00:55:26,281
you were allowed to grab the balls and 
so what about the rules will never see 

1250
00:55:26,611 --> 00:55:27,510
knees to the head.
Right?

1251
00:55:27,511 --> 00:55:32,511
Under the unified rules,
they just implemented some more rules 

1252
00:55:32,511 --> 00:55:35,601
than you.
You want it to get rid of the midnight 

1253
00:55:35,601 --> 00:55:37,050
to 12 to six,
but they changed that,

1254
00:55:37,051 --> 00:55:37,420
right?
Yeah.

1255
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,440
Wow.
We should explain to people what it 

1256
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,941
means in mixed martial arts.
You not allowed to drop an elbow down 

1257
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:45,390
from like vertical.
You can drop it from 12 to 6:00

1258
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:50,900
and the only reason why that was 
invented back in the day when the 

1259
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,990
commissions were approving mma,
big John Mccarthy had to meet with them 

1260
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:57,741
and they wouldn't let anybody do that 
because they had seen people break 

1261
00:55:57,741 --> 00:55:59,220
bricks on espn by dropping elbows like 
that.

1262
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:04,220
And like if someone could pick a brick,
they could kill a person can do it like 

1263
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:04,220
this.
Right.

1264
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,960
It's so stupid.
I mean,

1265
00:56:06,961 --> 00:56:08,540
it's probably like one of the,
I mean,

1266
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:11,400
I wouldn't say it's the week,
it might be my weakest elbow,

1267
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,500
but I.
it's one of the weaker elbows.

1268
00:56:13,501 --> 00:56:18,501
Yeah.
I don't think it's nearly as strong as 

1269
00:56:18,501 --> 00:56:19,941
that kind of elbow pleasure.
If you hit a skull and I can tell it's 

1270
00:56:19,941 --> 00:56:19,941
totally still splinted for me when I 
fall.

1271
00:56:19,941 --> 00:56:20,760
Adrenaline and.
Okay.

1272
00:56:20,761 --> 00:56:22,790
That was from three to whatever you want
to,

1273
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,220
you know,
that door,

1274
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:27,100
horizontal elbows,
but still you don't want to hit.

1275
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:28,670
It's.
Yeah.

1276
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,620
You get field as little pieces.
You know,

1277
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:32,980
it's,
it's from this call from Kevin.

1278
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,390
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1279
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:35,570
yeah.
That's,

1280
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:37,300
it's just a dumb rule,
you know,

1281
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:39,940
and that's the one blemish and Jon Jones
record when he fought.

1282
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:41,870
Dropping those elbows.
Yeah,

1283
00:56:41,871 --> 00:56:42,690
yeah,
yeah.

1284
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,880
Totally legal.
Yeah.

1285
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:47,480
I don't know why they haven't put that 
back in a while.

1286
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,150
I thought that's what they were going to
do.

1287
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:53,730
Maybe they hit an nice socket,
may bend to.

1288
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:58,750
I could be really damaged,
but then again you can do that standing 

1289
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:02,930
like someone could tomahawk you standing
and it could go right into your eye 

1290
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:03,730
socket about soccer kicks and stomps Mr.
Rogen.

1291
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:04,450
Well,
see,

1292
00:57:04,451 --> 00:57:07,780
that's one of the things that we could 
have if we had a basketball court,

1293
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:13,110
you know,
you would have soccer kicks on the 

1294
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:13,110
ground like for sure.
I think so,

1295
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,520
yeah.
I think violent.

1296
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:16,480
I've never punched somebody on the 
ground.

1297
00:57:16,481 --> 00:57:19,790
You should be able to kick a member of 
when he was.

1298
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,530
First of all,
the stomping is great,

1299
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:24,460
but I couldn't believe it tomorrow.
Right.

1300
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:30,060
Condo condo veteran,
who's actually cut the Czech Republic 

1301
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,710
tomorrow.
Why he?

1302
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:36,220
Well,
he saw a box team.

1303
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:40,120
Mauricio Shogun Hua loves soccer.
He did.

1304
00:57:40,121 --> 00:57:44,040
He,
he pedaled kick this big ring Sakharova.

1305
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:46,170
His face looked like the elephant man to
that.

1306
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:51,240
There were some violent tendencies.
Environment I think is probably once 

1307
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,020
when Sakharova fought.
Melvin manhoef.

1308
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:58,680
That was horrendous.
Melvin was coming up in his prime and 

1309
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:02,011
Sakharova was on the way down in.
Melvin was arguably one of the scariest 

1310
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:05,620
strikers of all time.
Just unbelievably violent.

1311
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:08,410
Just took violence to a totally 
different level,

1312
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,660
knocked out Mark Hunt.

1313
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:14,470
You know what?
I think he had a double mark,

1314
00:58:14,471 --> 00:58:19,471
had a double knock out there and I,
you got to pull it up to see if I'm 

1315
00:58:19,471 --> 00:58:20,070
right.
I believe if my shirts,

1316
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:21,580
we was locked out twice,
you know,

1317
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:26,380
he was knocked out and when he fell down
he hits the cup also for maneuver and we

1318
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:28,530
had all of the old steel cups and he 
hits a talk.

1319
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,750
He falls down,
he sees boom under coping.

1320
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:33,380
I think maybe that sealed the deal,
right?

1321
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:35,160
They're just saying,
we'll find that.

1322
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:38,010
Find that story.
Mark hunted.

1323
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:40,470
Well now we will probably.
Or what's he doing with the lot.

1324
00:58:40,471 --> 00:58:41,910
But again,
another guy,

1325
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:47,880
he's a,
he's got the UFC because the UFC day 

1326
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:51,100
he's saying that they knew here here's a
fight.

1327
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:52,690
Oh,
hold on.

1328
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:58,190
Go right here.
I hope my charges paid him full under.

1329
00:58:59,481 --> 00:59:04,481
Yeah.
I need bumps and forward with the Times 

1330
00:59:04,481 --> 00:59:08,700
on the way down to go and mark the cost.
Yeah,

1331
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,700
right into the steel account man.
And it's like he was sprawling almost.

1332
00:59:15,701 --> 00:59:17,830
You push his hips forward.
Wow.

1333
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:18,490
Yeah.
He was,

1334
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,880
he still is an animal.
The guy that ever lived

1335
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,110
by the sword wore one of those steel 
cups.

1336
00:59:24,111 --> 00:59:29,111
Will is a mere renova already.
He used to wear one of those steel cups 

1337
00:59:29,111 --> 00:59:30,590
and he'd get on top of mount.
Yet with that fucking Steel Cup,

1338
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:36,010
he was quite the goddamn weapon.
Press it into things that he was the 

1339
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:40,751
star of your stag stag.
Still people that are under steady in 

1340
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:43,670
half.
God,

1341
00:59:43,671 --> 00:59:45,690
if I shouldn't have gotten somebody,
have God right,

1342
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:47,360
and if I sit in it,
I grew up in bite ahead.

1343
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:50,720
I can literally bounce his own knee into
his face.

1344
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:53,150
That's an illegal move.
MMA,

1345
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:56,610
and it's a real easy thing to do.
Imagine that.

1346
00:59:56,650 --> 01:00:00,230
The Nice right over here,
just thrust my hips forward.

1347
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:03,260
His own knee will bash in his face and 
ask big.

1348
01:00:03,261 --> 01:00:04,370
Joe Mccarthy says,
yeah,

1349
01:00:04,371 --> 01:00:06,260
that's illegal move.
So I go,

1350
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:07,820
man,
I haven't seen anybody do that.

1351
01:00:07,821 --> 01:00:09,200
But that little lid knocking himself 
out,

1352
01:00:09,201 --> 01:00:09,680
but different way.

1353
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:12,470
See,
you're pushing his head into his knee.

1354
01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:13,700
No,
I grab his head.

1355
01:00:13,701 --> 01:00:18,701
By the time he can not push me backwards
and then I drive my hips forward and his

1356
01:00:18,801 --> 01:00:22,910
own knee because his leg is here over 
here,

1357
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:26,720
I can fit into his own face and he's 
going to stop my hip power,

1358
01:00:26,721 --> 01:00:28,430
which is going to be very hard to do for
him,

1359
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,590
for him in that same position.
Hm.

1360
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:34,610
Have you drilled that?
I in my class.

1361
01:00:34,611 --> 01:00:35,430
I teach it.
Yeah.

1362
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,670
Huh?
Guys pull that off.

1363
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,260
Oh,
it's a real easy thing.

1364
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:41,390
It's very hard for you to stop me.
That's interesting.

1365
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:43,040
We can jump into my,
you,

1366
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:45,740
I can show it to you.
Isn't that funny?

1367
01:00:45,741 --> 01:00:47,180
When people learn things and you go,
oh,

1368
01:00:47,181 --> 01:00:48,590
well there's that now,
right.

1369
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:52,130
You know,
for a long time guys would go uh,

1370
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:57,190
and they would go and throw under hooks 
on like from the half guard and then 

1371
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:58,610
they would try to like sneak up to your 
body and then work their way in.

1372
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:03,610
But then people started Darson people.
So then that under hook became like a 

1373
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:04,550
real liability for those long arm Doris 
guys.

1374
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:07,220
And that's just sort of had a,
it had a change,

1375
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:07,960
you know,
it had a,

1376
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:13,190
people have evolved.
We've installed an early days with the 

1377
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:13,800
kickboxing Tyberg book show,
Ramon Dekkers,

1378
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:14,870
you know,
in the clinch,

1379
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:15,980
pushing somebody away,
boom,

1380
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:19,040
hiking and it went down and then you see
everybody starts doing it,

1381
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:20,780
then everybody knows you that doesn't 
work anymore.

1382
01:01:20,781 --> 01:01:25,781
And then he did.
He pushed away with the low kick and I 

1383
01:01:25,781 --> 01:01:25,781
go,
wow,

1384
01:01:25,781 --> 01:01:26,750
when I teach this a lot in my class too,
because if I push you,

1385
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:30,890
you're off your balance shifts backwards
show you don't flex your leg.

1386
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,080
That low kick doesn't need to be hard.
Trust me,

1387
01:01:33,081 --> 01:01:35,260
because the muscle is relaxed.
It goes straight through.

1388
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,150
So a little while you kick as a very 
good thing to do.

1389
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:40,340
You look at the expeditious evolution of
it.

1390
01:01:40,341 --> 01:01:43,580
When we go back and remember doing 
voiceover for some pancreas,

1391
01:01:43,581 --> 01:01:45,830
have fights for fight network in Toronto
and,

1392
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:50,990
and you know back where you go and you 
watch a sport under what was mma rules 

1393
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:51,980
and well there's that,
there's that,

1394
01:01:51,981 --> 01:01:55,610
but it just didn't exist to them at the 
time in there.

1395
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:56,200
The,
the,

1396
01:01:56,201 --> 01:01:57,680
the,
the mindset or the,

1397
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:00,320
the,
the drilling as you say,

1398
01:02:00,321 --> 01:02:01,180
and it's,
it's,

1399
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:04,550
it's interesting when you look at now 
people who,

1400
01:02:04,551 --> 01:02:07,790
that's all they've trained in guys like 
a courtyard,

1401
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:09,350
pat for instance,
and all these kids,

1402
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:11,510
Tj dillashaw where it's,
it's,

1403
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:14,030
it's,
I love this growth.

1404
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:16,250
There's only a certain amount of moves 
that you can do right there.

1405
01:02:16,251 --> 01:02:18,380
Like armbars.
Everybody's always just chokes.

1406
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:20,520
It's Dah weight towards

1407
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:25,790
those.
If you find a different way going 

1408
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:27,891
through that certain Armbar,
then you surprise somebody and that you 

1409
01:02:27,891 --> 01:02:28,000
see that happening a lot.
Suddenly it as a triangle choke,

1410
01:02:28,001 --> 01:02:29,190
the new triangle,
choke setup.

1411
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:31,200
Then everybody starts doing it and it's 
gone again,

1412
01:02:31,201 --> 01:02:32,940
but it's just about that.
The move is there,

1413
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,400
but what the setup is every certain 
kicks,

1414
01:02:35,401 --> 01:02:35,760
right?
Well,

1415
01:02:35,761 --> 01:02:38,460
karate and taekwondo.
Same thing that you thought,

1416
01:02:38,461 --> 01:02:39,360
oh,
that would never work,

1417
01:02:39,361 --> 01:02:40,950
and all of a sudden everyone's know for 
a while.

1418
01:02:40,951 --> 01:02:45,360
The front kick to the face and frank 
with you seen that with wonderboy.

1419
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:50,810
Wonderboy is perfect example of what I 
thought was going to be the next stage 

1420
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:51,540
of evolution as the sport karate guys.
The guys,

1421
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:53,670
you know,
like Michael Venom page,

1422
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,400
Raymond Daniels,
Daniels,

1423
01:02:58,430 --> 01:03:01,710
and what these guys are doing is they're
showing that if you have all those other

1424
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:06,711
skills will then those traditional 
martial arts techniques become very 

1425
01:03:06,711 --> 01:03:07,710
novel and people don't know what to do 
with them.

1426
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,620
Like with wonderboy and he started 
stabbing people with that front leg side

1427
01:03:10,621 --> 01:03:12,480
kick and then throws that frontline 
round kick.

1428
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:14,150
People don't know what to do with.
Cool.

1429
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:18,930
And he's also got that crazy style of 
leak leaning back and forth like a snake

1430
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:24,260
popping back in.
It's gonna be very interesting to 

1431
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:25,590
rematch though because I think.
I think even though it was a draw,

1432
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:28,620
I guess according to the score card it 
would be a draw.

1433
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:33,920
When you look at who did more damage,
it's clearly woodley woodley did way 

1434
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,830
more damage in two rounds he had.
He had wonderboy and some serious shit.

1435
01:03:37,831 --> 01:03:42,831
Yup.
And also for whatever inexplicable 

1436
01:03:42,831 --> 01:03:42,831
reason,
and he doesn't even know why I asked him

1437
01:03:42,831 --> 01:03:45,330
about it after the fight.
He didn't take them down after the first

1438
01:03:45,331 --> 01:03:46,680
round.
Am I cute?

1439
01:03:46,681 --> 01:03:47,390
You know,
he was like,

1440
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:49,950
if you asked me right now,
I have no idea why I did and he's like,

1441
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:52,170
I got 20 years of wrestling,
you would think I would use it,

1442
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:54,480
and he had so much success in the first 
round,

1443
01:03:54,481 --> 01:03:55,230
taking them down.

1444
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:00,920
But then again,
he almost knocked him out in the fourth 

1445
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:00,920
round to remember he stunned them in the
fourth round,

1446
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:01,850
just shoulders,
eyes,

1447
01:04:01,851 --> 01:04:02,580
book.
Yeah.

1448
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:03,570
Yeah.
It was,

1449
01:04:03,571 --> 01:04:04,710
um,
it was a pretty,

1450
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:07,530
it was an interesting fight because 
would wonder.

1451
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:10,830
Boy Did regain some points and regained 
some ground,

1452
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:13,500
but he never really had woodley in any 
real trouble.

1453
01:04:13,501 --> 01:04:18,501
And I think that is always the ultimate 
point of fighting is like who puts the 

1454
01:04:18,501 --> 01:04:22,851
other person in grave danger?
And clearly woodley put wonderboy in 

1455
01:04:22,851 --> 01:04:24,840
grave danger.
He had him stand.

1456
01:04:24,841 --> 01:04:26,730
Deanna fucked up.
He was beating him up.

1457
01:04:26,731 --> 01:04:28,690
He caught them.
He had them in a guillotine,

1458
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:32,310
looked like his head was gonna pop off.
He had him in far more dangerous.

1459
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:37,100
The cutesy was something else.
Scrase escaped.

1460
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:38,460
I'm out.
I just wonder how.

1461
01:04:39,010 --> 01:04:41,320
I wonder how he holds his hands.
You know,

1462
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:43,620
because there's some guys that are,
it's a diy,

1463
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:48,680
there's different ways to hold your 
hands where you can really like 

1464
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:51,740
accentuate the bone into the neck and 
really there's little minute details and

1465
01:04:52,201 --> 01:04:54,830
gay teens that you never know.
Right.

1466
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:58,950
That's the Alpha male members of wicked 
ones.

1467
01:04:58,951 --> 01:05:00,960
Yep.
And of course Marcello Garcia.

1468
01:05:00,961 --> 01:05:04,080
So he's probably got one of the best 
teams I've ever seen in history.

1469
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,790
Grappling competition.
Yup.

1470
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:07,830
You know,
and then cody mackenzie had that fucking

1471
01:05:07,831 --> 01:05:12,060
crazy squished down the side and that's 
what John Jones used to go to prayer.

1472
01:05:12,061 --> 01:05:13,980
Hey,
old marine during pride days member,

1473
01:05:13,981 --> 01:05:17,740
he had a slick year team.
Vito Belfort,

1474
01:05:17,741 --> 01:05:17,910
right?

1475
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:23,520
He's in my class like a while ago,
there was in my old gym and we've been 

1476
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:23,830
working out tonight teaching my class.
I say,

1477
01:05:23,831 --> 01:05:28,831
Hey,
would you like to teach that guillotine 

1478
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:28,831
to the,
to the guys?

1479
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:28,831
Yeah,
sure.

1480
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:28,831
He said,
yeah,

1481
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:28,960
put me in as far as so I could feel how 
it is.

1482
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,720
But he went freaking 80 percent and I 
go,

1483
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:32,230
Whoa,
Whoa,

1484
01:05:32,231 --> 01:05:32,790
Whoa,
whoa.

1485
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,920
I mean that was a scam.
Why?

1486
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:36,940
Why?
Because she's got these long arms,

1487
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:37,960
you know,
and they,

1488
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:42,970
they go around and it's like the prayer 
becomes a bloodshot instead of just 

1489
01:05:44,951 --> 01:05:45,980
crushing the windpipe.
Yeah.

1490
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:48,010
He's so jacked.
He's,

1491
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:51,490
he's such a fucking giant dude too with 
those long arms,

1492
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:56,610
you know,
you show to see him doing like lifting 

1493
01:05:56,610 --> 01:05:56,610
cars and all that stuff that he didn't 
hold it,

1494
01:05:56,610 --> 01:05:58,590
that walking with like 150 kilos,
you know,

1495
01:05:58,670 --> 01:06:01,120
75 kilos in each thing and then running 
with it,

1496
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:02,180
you know,
like a suitcase.

1497
01:06:02,370 --> 01:06:05,440
Again,
another guy who represents redemption in

1498
01:06:05,441 --> 01:06:10,441
the sport and you,
you'll here now what's going on with 

1499
01:06:10,441 --> 01:06:10,441
Rhonda and everything,
but even mark Carney,

1500
01:06:10,610 --> 01:06:11,420
mma,
I'm,

1501
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,780
you know,
I spent a few years now doing boxing.

1502
01:06:13,781 --> 01:06:17,080
We're one last ruins your career.
It seems for whatever stupid reason,

1503
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:21,280
but in mma there are so many redundant.
Even overeem has been up,

1504
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:21,890
down,
up.

1505
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:23,950
There's still a bad narrative and 
boxing,

1506
01:06:23,951 --> 01:06:26,630
unfortunately someone who loses a fight 
doesn't come back.

1507
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:30,100
It was going to help that I think for a 
bit.

1508
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:31,270
It did.
I mean,

1509
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:34,720
Bernard Hopkins had an old fame career 
after losing his first fight.

1510
01:06:34,721 --> 01:06:37,900
So I don't understand that.
Then Gable,

1511
01:06:37,901 --> 01:06:38,980
Dan Gable,
he uh,

1512
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:42,000
we were interviewing him and he saw this
record and like,

1513
01:06:42,070 --> 01:06:44,350
but with randy couture record another 
record and he goes,

1514
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:46,810
like,
he's a world champion,

1515
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:50,380
but we're talking to a guy who lost once
in his life,

1516
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:51,430
you know,
so he goes,

1517
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:52,900
oh,
I didn't know that.

1518
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:55,630
He was totally shocked by it.
Many ways to win,

1519
01:06:55,631 --> 01:06:57,310
many ways to lose,
right Wayne,

1520
01:06:57,350 --> 01:07:01,510
different world people are throwing 
their punches and kicks and catching you

1521
01:07:01,511 --> 01:07:03,910
with knees and take them down.
Cro Cop was,

1522
01:07:03,911 --> 01:07:07,360
the guy told us in Japan that if you 
don't lose an mma,

1523
01:07:07,361 --> 01:07:09,080
you really haven't fucked.
Had been.

1524
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:10,900
He was trying to make the point of,
you know,

1525
01:07:10,901 --> 01:07:11,380
it's,
it's,

1526
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:15,610
it's so tough guys that are gonna 
happen,

1527
01:07:15,611 --> 01:07:17,170
man.
It's also evolving.

1528
01:07:17,171 --> 01:07:19,510
It's radical pace.
I mean,

1529
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:23,290
you're seeing all these new approaches 
constantly changing.

1530
01:07:23,291 --> 01:07:25,350
So many great minds involved.
Yeah,

1531
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:26,320
that's what I liked.
I mean,

1532
01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:29,150
ferris a hobby and I made want the list 
can go on.

1533
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:32,050
But that's what,
that's what I become now a bit more of a

1534
01:07:32,051 --> 01:07:34,360
nerd because you call so many fights in 
you.

1535
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:37,330
You try to have a life as well,
but I'm really now getting back into,

1536
01:07:37,331 --> 01:07:42,331
okay,
let's catch up and see what these 

1537
01:07:42,331 --> 01:07:42,331
different minds of sang well and you 
yourself sir,

1538
01:07:42,331 --> 01:07:42,331
even,
you know,

1539
01:07:42,331 --> 01:07:44,450
listening to this,
it's just always so cool to,

1540
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:46,330
to hear different perspectives and.

1541
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:46,820
Okay.
Yeah,

1542
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:53,320
that's super important for all of us.
I think that's why Bj's going to do 

1543
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:53,320
good.
It really,

1544
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,840
I truly believe drinking because he 
changed camp.

1545
01:07:55,841 --> 01:07:59,530
I think talent,
like Bj in his training in Hawaii,

1546
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:04,740
you know,
he kinda dictates whatever he wants to 

1547
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:04,740
do.
He's so talented.

1548
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:07,651
He schools people around and that's why 
when you put people like that on the 

1549
01:08:07,651 --> 01:08:10,081
pressure,
they get tired because they never 

1550
01:08:10,081 --> 01:08:10,480
experienced that enduring because he's 
so way ahead above everybody else.

1551
01:08:10,481 --> 01:08:12,640
So if they want to do extra three rounds
with him,

1552
01:08:12,641 --> 01:08:17,641
he prayed and he doesn't want to do it.
He's going to gonna I'm not going to do 

1553
01:08:17,641 --> 01:08:17,641
I.
it's a bad example that

1554
01:08:17,641 --> 01:08:18,240
drake at Greg Winkeljohn,
you know,

1555
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,030
and there he's got all these guys 
gunning for him.

1556
01:08:20,031 --> 01:08:25,031
It's Alegent.
I mean I can only imagine the sparring 

1557
01:08:25,031 --> 01:08:25,031
sessions they have going on.
I think it's going to do really well for

1558
01:08:25,031 --> 01:08:25,980
him now.
His opponent?

1559
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:27,720
Yeah.
Rodriguez is really good know,

1560
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:28,140
so.
Okay.

1561
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:31,210
But I had a conflict the whole honestly 
the.

1562
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:36,610
He's a hall of Famer.
Done everything we saw against Frankie 

1563
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:36,610
Edgar.
What is it?

1564
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:38,060
We talked about our podcast.
The last one was Matt Hughes.

1565
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:39,610
Twenty 10.
Do you.

1566
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:41,720
Why do you think he's still fighting?
Well,

1567
01:08:41,721 --> 01:08:43,940
he probably feels like he didn't do it 
right.

1568
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:49,280
He probably feels like the fights he 
took with Frankie where you had that 

1569
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:52,100
really bizarre standup stance here was 
the weirdest thing I've ever seen.

1570
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:57,130
He decided that he was going to fight 
that way because it was more efficient 

1571
01:08:57,130 --> 01:08:59,000
and it didn't use as much energy as 
widening his stance and he,

1572
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:04,001
I think a lot of his career he was 
concerned with losing his energy in the 

1573
01:09:04,001 --> 01:09:04,220
ring.

1574
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:05,290
Yup.
A lot of his crew.

1575
01:09:05,291 --> 01:09:06,560
He's worried about gassing.
Yep.

1576
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,450
So then he went with [inaudible].
Right.

1577
01:09:08,451 --> 01:09:11,990
So he does these two camps with Marvin 
intervention at least two camps.

1578
01:09:11,991 --> 01:09:12,770
Correct.
He did.

1579
01:09:12,771 --> 01:09:14,030
Sean Sherk and I.
Thank you.

1580
01:09:14,031 --> 01:09:15,380
Did Diego Sanchez?
I know he did.

1581
01:09:15,381 --> 01:09:20,381
Diego Sanchez,
because I know also that Steve Maxwell 

1582
01:09:20,381 --> 01:09:21,320
was training Diego Sanchez got Sanchez 
in incredible shape,

1583
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:26,540
but that was Bj in his prime and when Bj
wasn't tired when he was in shape and he

1584
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:29,260
was joking around about it,
like when I have a six pack here before,

1585
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:35,670
what was it?
He wasn't just a different animal back 

1586
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:38,081
then,
but it was only sustainable for like a 

1587
01:09:38,081 --> 01:09:38,410
few fights.
I think Bj,

1588
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:43,450
it's for whatever reason,
it was hard for him to get totally 

1589
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:44,720
motivated to get into that kind of shape
again.

1590
01:09:44,721 --> 01:09:47,000
And when he described it,
it sounded hilarious.

1591
01:09:47,001 --> 01:09:48,740
Like he couldn't hold his daughter,
literally,

1592
01:09:48,741 --> 01:09:52,670
literally so tired after working out 
that he couldn't even hold his kid.

1593
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:56,690
And they have a very specific training 
philosophy to the marina bitches.

1594
01:09:56,691 --> 01:09:58,430
And uh,
in a lot of ways,

1595
01:09:58,431 --> 01:09:59,360
um,
uh,

1596
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:03,560
some of the guys that like Nickerson who
trains under his philosophy and speed of

1597
01:10:03,561 --> 01:10:08,561
sport in California,
they want strength and conditioning to 

1598
01:10:08,561 --> 01:10:09,980
be number one priority number one.
You already know how to fight.

1599
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,290
I love that.
Yeah.

1600
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:12,970
And the idea is like,
you already know how to find it.

1601
01:10:12,971 --> 01:10:14,630
Okay.
So since you already know how to fight,

1602
01:10:14,631 --> 01:10:18,710
you should just work on having the most 
incredible aerobic threshold,

1603
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:23,050
which is back to frank and a plan to 
Ortiz.

1604
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:23,690
Well,
yeah,

1605
01:10:23,691 --> 01:10:27,960
but even Franco with the.
Why am I going to Kip Maury Smith with a

1606
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:31,460
new partner show you in the beginning,
that's what frank was all about was the.

1607
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:36,461
Couldn't be cardio.
The cardio was so important on the bus 

1608
01:10:36,461 --> 01:10:37,460
back when Tito lost you,
frank.

1609
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:42,460
I was in the same bus going back to the 
airport that Tito was jump next to me 

1610
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:46,091
and he starts asking me a question about
seven because I always said is the most 

1611
01:10:46,091 --> 01:10:46,490
important thing.
You can never have enough stamina.

1612
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:51,600
That's the most important choice that 
asking drills and doing all these 

1613
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:52,190
things.
And then he became that crazy cycle,

1614
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:53,650
cardio cardio,
you know,

1615
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:58,680
and he started beating everybody.
So he was transferred that to Kendall 

1616
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:02,140
Grove and one of the guys on the train 
into the ultimate fighter Kendall came 

1617
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:02,140
out of that show and that's what he told
me.

1618
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:02,960
He was like,
it's all cardio,

1619
01:11:02,961 --> 01:11:04,860
man.
Everything is about cardio when.

1620
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:07,070
But again,
cardio also.

1621
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:11,890
What about the nerves then and how much 
panicking and your emotions drained?

1622
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:13,840
Like what I'm saying plays factor in it,

1623
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:18,060
but the actual real cold hard cardio 
plays a factor too.

1624
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:21,270
Then it also plays a factor in your 
nerves because if you know that you have

1625
01:11:21,271 --> 01:11:23,700
a small gas tank and you started your 
lit up.

1626
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:28,720
Yup.
And especially when you walk to the 

1627
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:28,720
ring,
did I train hard enough?

1628
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:29,310
You know,
if you know that you can really go,

1629
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:30,720
you know,
after work I done,

1630
01:11:30,721 --> 01:11:32,270
we'll do seven,
six minutes round.

1631
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:36,590
So that type at full blast,
that's like 42 minutes and.

1632
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:41,630
But that was after a workout but I knew 
that nobody did that so I was not going 

1633
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:45,311
to run out of gas because we had half 
our fights in Japan but it's the only 

1634
01:11:45,311 --> 01:11:45,660
way to do it.
Constantly go hard.

1635
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:50,690
And I had guys coming who couldn't do 
the warmup in my class is a 20 minute 

1636
01:11:50,690 --> 01:11:54,420
warmup,
is the boss where to work with the 

1637
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:56,191
sprawls and at a minutes I fill them up 
with the idea pushups or with the 

1638
01:11:56,191 --> 01:11:56,191
kettlebell swings.

1639
01:11:56,280 --> 01:12:01,280
So it's 20 minutes straight.
People come in who had a fight like in 

1640
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:01,320
two weeks in Japan and it couldn't do 
it.

1641
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:02,190
They had to man.
I said,

1642
01:12:02,191 --> 01:12:02,960
don't fight.
He said,

1643
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:03,540
what do you mean?
I said,

1644
01:12:03,541 --> 01:12:08,541
this is the warm up.
It didn't even start now and let's say 

1645
01:12:08,541 --> 01:12:09,710
they lost because of cardio over there,
but how.

1646
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:10,890
But how do you do it?
As I said,

1647
01:12:10,891 --> 01:12:13,860
it's just baby steps it.
You just get yourself to the point where

1648
01:12:13,861 --> 01:12:16,820
you can get through that entire warmup,
full clip and then just.

1649
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:18,630
Yeah,
just keep doing it.

1650
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:22,260
Who can do things?
So best conditioned athlete right now in

1651
01:12:22,261 --> 01:12:24,520
MMA or what?
Like what are names that come to mind?

1652
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:26,240
Is Alaska's right away I would think.
Right.

1653
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:28,130
Cane and he's a freak.
He's afraid.

1654
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:31,350
I mean there's a lot of really good guys
down 90 miles.

1655
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:31,700
Right?

1656
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:34,260
He's tired,
but he's also so efficient.

1657
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:37,230
You could also say the same thing about 
cody and dominic.

1658
01:12:37,231 --> 01:12:42,231
Yeah,
I was going to say that was more civil 

1659
01:12:42,231 --> 01:12:42,231
war for 25 minutes.
No,

1660
01:12:42,231 --> 01:12:42,231
you're right.
There's a lot more.

1661
01:12:42,231 --> 01:12:46,940
It's becoming a bigger deal.
In the early days it was only the WC 

1662
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:49,150
guys because I've got a lighter guys,
but now everybody,

1663
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:54,370
while they hit me the most,
if a guy comes in with no cardio for 

1664
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:54,750
three rounds,
I go,

1665
01:12:54,751 --> 01:12:59,751
you're serious.
It's like bringing a half a can of 

1666
01:12:59,751 --> 01:12:59,751
paint.
If you're a painter too,

1667
01:12:59,751 --> 01:13:00,640
you do the door half.
Yeah.

1668
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:02,400
That's the only thing I have.
It's the same thing.

1669
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:05,160
But your ds,
the Ds Boys,

1670
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:06,570
Nick and native.
Uh,

1671
01:13:06,571 --> 01:13:07,470
always.
I mean,

1672
01:13:07,471 --> 01:13:09,920
when you think of wow,
the triathlons,

1673
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:14,930
know that he swam from Alcatraz five 
times now five times now the podcast,

1674
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:22,480
like,
what the fuck?

1675
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:24,960
He's coming.
Is he coming back soon?

1676
01:13:25,410 --> 01:13:27,200
Let's go get some,
a world title fight.

1677
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:28,210
There are a bunch of miles.
Yeah.

1678
01:13:28,211 --> 01:13:28,830
Yeah.
Look,

1679
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:29,850
I,
I thought like,

1680
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:35,070
you know,
crazy would be of connor fought 

1681
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:35,070
nickname.

1682
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:39,580
Now you say so they're already saying 
that connor,

1683
01:13:41,581 --> 01:13:44,460
that he shouldn't have fought nate 
because nate was too big for him,

1684
01:13:44,461 --> 01:13:49,461
but he made his a one.
That's a fight that's going to happen 

1685
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:50,660
again.
You have to.

1686
01:13:50,670 --> 01:13:54,300
Connor stays the 155 pound champ.
Do you remember going to happen again?

1687
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,600
Oh,
I wonder if it's on a grid.

1688
01:13:56,610 --> 01:14:01,610
You Remember Diaz in daily?
Sitting there and just calling him like 

1689
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:09,440
twice.
He was knocked down twice back and 

1690
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:09,640
stopped him with three seconds left 
recoveries.

1691
01:14:09,690 --> 01:14:14,690
Always fantastic.
That seminar in Goma and then the 

1692
01:14:14,690 --> 01:14:16,890
fricken thc.
Why did they test for that?

1693
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:18,520
While we don't want to get into that 
now,

1694
01:14:18,521 --> 01:14:21,970
I'm sure is an athletic conditioning.
Tests tests forever.

1695
01:14:23,450 --> 01:14:24,910
All my friends,
they're tell you.

1696
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:29,920
Okay.
They're saying now that they're gonna 

1697
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:30,820
they're thinking about calming down on 
that and then not.

1698
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:33,250
Not even caring if people test positive.

1699
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,200
Well,
I hope so.

1700
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:40,260
Which would be a good thing because the 
way the level show in your skin and the 

1701
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:44,041
way it stays in your fat,
like if you got high the night before a 

1702
01:14:44,041 --> 01:14:47,851
fight,
you're not going to feel it during the 

1703
01:14:47,851 --> 01:14:47,851
fight.
You just not.

1704
01:14:47,851 --> 01:14:50,260
But if it's an of will show up maybe.
Yeah,

1705
01:14:50,261 --> 01:14:55,261
but you'd have to really fucked up and 
over and you'll probably get new ideas 

1706
01:14:55,261 --> 01:14:58,570
on his podcast.
I have not ever seen anybody.

1707
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:01,360
One of those gummy bears was like 
$1,200.

1708
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:06,370
The only guy I think he ate ate,
that's so insane.

1709
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:11,400
Like that writer from the New York 
newspaper went to Denver and did a piece

1710
01:15:11,471 --> 01:15:16,471
and she ate a whole shock by guests who 
was like eight different doses or how 

1711
01:15:16,471 --> 01:15:18,640
many different doses and talk wrote 
about her good oil.

1712
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:20,380
Yeah,
you shouldn't be paranoid.

1713
01:15:20,381 --> 01:15:22,250
You're a little flesh bag on the planet.

1714
01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:26,830
My daughter went to a planet totally 
through infinity.

1715
01:15:26,831 --> 01:15:28,970
You should be nervous as fuck.
Ever.

1716
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:31,930
We'd go rock could fly on the sky and 
kill you.

1717
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,710
I thought I took it.
I made a quiche.

1718
01:15:34,711 --> 01:15:37,000
Some cookies.
This is eight,

1719
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:39,040
nine years back.
And uh,

1720
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:44,140
I,
I crank one because they're heavy 

1721
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:44,880
cookies and while I'm eating a little 
crumble fulls of the ground and I,

1722
01:15:44,930 --> 01:15:46,670
I see the dog right away running over 
it.

1723
01:15:46,671 --> 01:15:48,640
I want to stop it and I go,
you know,

1724
01:15:50,010 --> 01:15:51,490
but the little tiny bit,
right.

1725
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:56,840
So I'm eating it and I have to pick up 
something from a friend of mine who was 

1726
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:56,840
like 20 minutes away here somewhere in 
the valley.

1727
01:15:57,110 --> 01:15:58,870
Uh,
I go pick it up,

1728
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:03,960
I'm back in the car and as soon as I'm 
in the car started driving and it hits 

1729
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:07,351
me.
I'm going to hit and within two minutes 

1730
01:16:07,351 --> 01:16:07,351
I got a phone call from my wife.

1731
01:16:07,351 --> 01:16:11,800
What did you do?
I remember talk outside,

1732
01:16:12,490 --> 01:16:14,680
staring outside for like two and a half 
hours.

1733
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:17,170
No,
which is looking at site.

1734
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:18,980
It was the funniest thing.
I came home.

1735
01:16:19,010 --> 01:16:22,620
He was just like poor,
poor Louis has been high a few times.

1736
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:27,430
Luna doesn't like men,
but she made a connection,

1737
01:16:27,431 --> 01:16:30,550
but no,
that's a rather intimate one.

1738
01:16:30,610 --> 01:16:32,880
She doesn't like men for some reason.
She,

1739
01:16:32,881 --> 01:16:33,850
oh,
she will go after you.

1740
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:36,070
Wow.
Kits and women are cool,

1741
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:37,420
but a guy,
oh,

1742
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:40,600
the mailman literally does the dog that 
will go a full mode attack.

1743
01:16:40,601 --> 01:16:43,260
It is a little dog is 15 pounds.
So it's the dog,

1744
01:16:43,410 --> 01:16:47,770
a poodle.
I love that.

1745
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:49,240
Oh,
that's hilarious.

1746
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:52,390
Her.
How's your arm?

1747
01:16:52,391 --> 01:16:55,190
It looks like you're getting a lot of 
muscle back and your arm.

1748
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:55,960
You know,
at the top.

1749
01:16:55,990 --> 01:17:00,990
I'm getting it back,
but you see below there still something 

1750
01:17:00,990 --> 01:17:01,030
to be done.
I'm here with an a in the valley.

1751
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:03,700
There's a doctor now and he does these 
crazy injections also.

1752
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:05,080
Uh,
and it's elite.

1753
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,510
It's caught to nervous scorch somewhere.
So.

1754
01:17:07,511 --> 01:17:09,720
And I feel that something is caught 
costs.

1755
01:17:09,730 --> 01:17:10,190
Yeah.
So

1756
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:11,420
to impinged.
Yeah.

1757
01:17:11,421 --> 01:17:14,390
So what they say is if you take a fire,
a water hose,

1758
01:17:14,450 --> 01:17:15,920
if you squeeze it,
water comes out.

1759
01:17:15,921 --> 01:17:20,921
That's the same with an nerf action 
comes out and that apparently they made 

1760
01:17:20,921 --> 01:17:22,340
this special,
a picture that they only could do in,

1761
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:27,400
uh,
Santa Monica and they saw that it was 

1762
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:30,011
blocked there and he can apparently he 
can inject me there and they will take 

1763
01:17:30,011 --> 01:17:33,851
the pressure off and he,
he believes that that's very possible 

1764
01:17:33,851 --> 01:17:35,290
that we'll come back then.
So yeah,

1765
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:40,300
it's crazy because she stepping,
my fingers is still very hot and I get 

1766
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:41,330
this.
But I could do that for four years.

1767
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:42,830
Wow.
That even snapping my fingers.

1768
01:17:42,831 --> 01:17:46,310
So slowly but surely it works.
I just work out the arm and the shoulder

1769
01:17:46,311 --> 01:17:47,710
shoulder comes back also a little bit.

1770
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:49,460
That's the thing that they say about 
nerves,

1771
01:17:49,461 --> 01:17:54,461
right?
That any kind of nerve damage takes a 

1772
01:17:54,461 --> 01:17:54,461
tremendous amount of time to heal 
because nerves,

1773
01:17:54,461 --> 01:17:55,220
they grow vag very,
very slow,

1774
01:17:55,221 --> 01:17:57,930
very slow people.
They don't understand it.

1775
01:17:57,931 --> 01:17:59,850
I always say it's like digging the spark
plug out of a,

1776
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,150
a cylinder that's your nerve.
Once the nerve is broke,

1777
01:18:03,151 --> 01:18:04,920
you take that out,
it's gone.

1778
01:18:04,921 --> 01:18:06,240
And then to atrophy comes,
you know,

1779
01:18:06,241 --> 01:18:08,520
because people go like,
how can you then be paralyzed?

1780
01:18:08,521 --> 01:18:13,521
I said,
what happens with people who bring it 

1781
01:18:13,521 --> 01:18:13,521
up,

1782
01:18:13,521 --> 01:18:13,521
right?
Yeah.

1783
01:18:13,521 --> 01:18:13,920
I said no more nerves going to the legs.
She can't walk anymore.

1784
01:18:13,921 --> 01:18:15,460
And that's the same thing what I have 
right now.

1785
01:18:15,461 --> 01:18:17,690
Only the nerve is still there.
It's just pressured.

1786
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:21,440
I ran into some kid after a show the 
other day and we were talking about neck

1787
01:18:21,441 --> 01:18:22,600
injuries,
uh,

1788
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:25,190
and Jujitsu and he was asking me a 
question and he's like,

1789
01:18:25,191 --> 01:18:28,580
my arm doesn't work under here.
My tricep starting to fade away.

1790
01:18:28,581 --> 01:18:29,270
And Mike,
dude,

1791
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:34,271
go to a doctor yesterday.
You got to get an Mri as soon as you 

1792
01:18:34,271 --> 01:18:35,930
start seeing atrophy and as soon as you 
start feeling numbness,

1793
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:37,860
you got to get on it right away.
Yep.

1794
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:43,120
Any impingement to necklace because 
there are some ways that they can sort 

1795
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:46,991
of relieve the pressure and spinal 
decompression and a bunch of different 

1796
01:18:46,991 --> 01:18:49,790
platelet rich plasma type of injections,
like Regena keen and stuff,

1797
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:52,850
but you got to do something and you got 
to do something quick and you can't keep

1798
01:18:52,851 --> 01:18:54,170
rolling.
All these guys,

1799
01:18:54,171 --> 01:18:59,171
they want to keep going to Jujitsu.
Even when their back's fucked up like 

1800
01:18:59,171 --> 01:18:59,440
that.
And then like as you're rolling,

1801
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:03,120
you feel like you feel like that twinge 
and shooting,

1802
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:09,180
doing real damage to yourself.
You've got to be super careful with any 

1803
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:09,470
kind of nerve injuries.
I waited too long.

1804
01:19:09,471 --> 01:19:11,240
That was the thing with me.
I waited too long.

1805
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:13,590
I realized I saw my arms slinking and 
then I go,

1806
01:19:13,591 --> 01:19:14,600
oh,
I gotta go to the doctor.

1807
01:19:14,601 --> 01:19:15,200
But it was already.

1808
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:19,190
I should've gone faster as soon as the 
pride.

1809
01:19:19,191 --> 01:19:20,600
Why?
Why didn't you go sooner?

1810
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:22,910
I don't know.
I thought it was going to fix itself.

1811
01:19:22,911 --> 01:19:27,911
I've been this indestructible guy from 
my windows from rooms that are not your 

1812
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:29,660
thing,
you know?

1813
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:34,920
I mean I feel I'm from a roof.
I fell on my face on the other step and 

1814
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:37,610
I put all my t stayed in.
It's the craziest thing.

1815
01:19:37,611 --> 01:19:39,800
You can tell by my front teeth.
I have something,

1816
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:42,170
but I mean,
how did my feet did not come out.

1817
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:45,800
I mean that was quite a fall.
You fell on your face from a roof.

1818
01:19:45,860 --> 01:19:48,960
You know what happened.
So you know those,

1819
01:19:49,010 --> 01:19:50,760
how you call those letters,
you know the,

1820
01:19:50,761 --> 01:19:52,030
the,
the feet pointed one.

1821
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:58,480
I'm very smart.
Of course it's stands like this and I'm 

1822
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:01,061
standing it up and I'm pushing something
and of course when I push the ladder 

1823
01:20:01,061 --> 01:20:05,641
stairs like this,
I pushed myself away and I'm following 

1824
01:20:05,641 --> 01:20:08,711
all the way down,
see a slow motion coming because one of 

1825
01:20:08,711 --> 01:20:08,711
the,

1826
01:20:08,711 --> 01:20:11,130
one of those stats things I go like,
oh,

1827
01:20:11,131 --> 01:20:13,740
I'm going to fall on it.
I realize I'm going to go slow motion.

1828
01:20:13,741 --> 01:20:15,420
So I stuck my arms out.
I think I'm good,

1829
01:20:15,421 --> 01:20:17,860
but it was longer than my arm for,
oh Geez.

1830
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:21,810
I train on that thing and it wasn't even
dazed.

1831
01:20:21,811 --> 01:20:22,610
I go like,
oh,

1832
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:24,750
a very gentle.
I went to my mouth,

1833
01:20:24,751 --> 01:20:25,830
I go,
please be in it.

1834
01:20:25,831 --> 01:20:30,130
You know,
and all my tooth fairy is insane.

1835
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:31,920
Right.
That would have killed 80 percent of the

1836
01:20:31,921 --> 01:20:35,680
population.
You walk away with no loose teeth.

1837
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:38,070
That's fucking hilarious,
man.

1838
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:39,940
That's hilarious.
Yeah.

1839
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:42,540
So in all the times when you guys were 
working in pride,

1840
01:20:42,730 --> 01:20:44,790
how did you see like when they were 
doing the.

1841
01:20:44,810 --> 01:20:47,480
We've given guys big bags of cash.
We guards there for.

1842
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:51,160
Oh yeah,
we got those back because for us to come

1843
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:56,160
to tell them about the first time.

1844
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:57,960
But what you wore when you went to the 
bank,

1845
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,570
you know,
the first time I got paid,

1846
01:21:00,870 --> 01:21:03,300
the first night Bushido you had to come 
and tell me,

1847
01:21:03,301 --> 01:21:03,840
hey,
this is,

1848
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:08,990
this is what's going to go.
Because they're always just like you 

1849
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:08,990
when you go into the bank.
A bank,

1850
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:10,350
right.
Perfectly packed.

1851
01:21:10,710 --> 01:21:14,220
You know Chris' notes.
I mean it looks like a monopoly money.

1852
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:18,180
Y'All really crisp $100 American bills.
I was living in Canada.

1853
01:21:18,181 --> 01:21:23,181
He was afraid I had to actually cry.
I crumpled they up because when I 

1854
01:21:23,181 --> 01:21:27,201
brought brand new bills,
I mean obviously they could tell it 

1855
01:21:27,201 --> 01:21:27,201
wasn't counterfeit,
but they'd always look and go,

1856
01:21:27,201 --> 01:21:29,310
what is this?
That's literally every,

1857
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:32,770
every show,
brand new $100.

1858
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,470
Million was always in the back of your 
head.

1859
01:21:34,471 --> 01:21:38,280
You go like,
I remember one time guns,

1860
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:43,850
people to fight us.
They will talk over each other.

1861
01:21:43,950 --> 01:21:45,000
Okay,
let's let Bob.

1862
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:46,150
So go ahead.
What?

1863
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:47,760
Every fight.
If I'm like,

1864
01:21:47,761 --> 01:21:48,330
they say,
okay,

1865
01:21:48,331 --> 01:21:53,331
from 10:00
AM tomorrow morning you can come and 

1866
01:21:53,331 --> 01:21:53,331
pick up your fight.
There was only one room and every single

1867
01:21:53,331 --> 01:21:56,220
fighter would ain't gonna.
Even guys like miracle Crocapo I know me

1868
01:21:56,221 --> 01:22:01,221
like 2 million bucks or something.
But they made a lot of money at the 

1869
01:22:01,221 --> 01:22:01,221
time,
you know?

1870
01:22:01,221 --> 01:22:04,730
And they gave everybody cash.
So I assumed they gave him Cassius well 

1871
01:22:05,161 --> 01:22:07,800
and I always thought men.
But then again,

1872
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:10,140
if the equity has evolved and maybe 
don't want to do that,

1873
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:10,590
right?
Yeah,

1874
01:22:10,591 --> 01:22:14,100
you definitely have to bring 10 grand.
Didn't remember they were telling family

1875
01:22:14,101 --> 01:22:16,920
members.
Here's your stacks marker.

1876
01:22:16,921 --> 01:22:19,560
I mean everybody on our team at the 
whole 10,000

1877
01:22:19,561 --> 01:22:20,190
feet,
10,000

1878
01:22:20,210 --> 01:22:25,210
feet,
because she can't bring more defense 

1879
01:22:25,210 --> 01:22:25,210
out.
She took one bill off,

1880
01:22:25,210 --> 01:22:27,450
so it was less than 10.
Had the roles in Rappongi.

1881
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:29,320
That is so crazy.
Yeah,

1882
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,620
that was wild,
but it looked nice.

1883
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:32,820
It looked cool.
When you came back,

1884
01:22:32,821 --> 01:22:36,780
you felt you felt good.
I felt like a criminal,

1885
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:42,720
criminal.
The big rural Mexico actually got 

1886
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:45,051
$2,000,000
in cash from the heavyweight Grand Prix 

1887
01:22:45,051 --> 01:22:45,630
and then put that in a suitcase and went
back to Croatia.

1888
01:22:45,631 --> 01:22:48,240
That's one of the most gangster fucking 
things I've ever heard in my life.

1889
01:22:50,410 --> 01:22:53,010
I mean,
that's like that's a scene in a movie.

1890
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:56,700
Be beat the fuck out of everybody.
A little title case you.

1891
01:22:56,701 --> 01:23:00,540
When that sperm tournament,
remember those sperm posters?

1892
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:06,010
Fucking person was awesome.
One of the posters.

1893
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:11,010
I feel bad I got rid of.
I had that post shirts or pluck.

1894
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,750
Remember that upright or plug?
What does that mean?

1895
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:19,290
Nobody knew and what lights that there 
is no such thing as doing so.

1896
01:23:20,130 --> 01:23:22,720
There's no sort of doing things as 
usual.

1897
01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:26,920
There's no such thing as doing things 
such as usual.

1898
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,180
He said,
I got to get the t shirt.

1899
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:35,660
That is the dumbest thing.
Nobody's going to get a member of the 

1900
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:38,020
Grand Prix poster with a woman 
breastfeeding the baby.

1901
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,140
Looks like,
what the heck is going on?

1902
01:23:40,470 --> 01:23:45,470
You have a Waleed Ishmael t shirt from 
like 1998.

1903
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:48,850
And it says,
don't be coward,

1904
01:23:48,851 --> 01:23:53,851
don't run off the fight.
And it says on it at the time,

1905
01:23:54,071 --> 01:23:59,071
wasn't a guy said he had made and he 
showed me and it was a direct 

1906
01:23:59,350 --> 01:24:02,110
translation for them.
Fulfill for fight,

1907
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:07,600
for fight,
for good luck with that buddy fight,

1908
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:13,760
but brutal miscalculations and 
translations because I lead with it.

1909
01:24:13,770 --> 01:24:15,970
He was hilarious.
I remember he uh,

1910
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:21,020
uh,
he was telling a story and then I 

1911
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:21,020
realized what a,
what I did.

1912
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:21,020
Because you did.
It's just kind of,

1913
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:24,820
you know,
I thought it was funny after my rental 

1914
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:24,820
man flight,
my base face was bashed in,

1915
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:25,300
right?
So I blew my nose,

1916
01:24:25,301 --> 01:24:30,301
of course,
once I wasn't addressing one because 

1917
01:24:30,301 --> 01:24:30,301
then I could do it.
I couldn't do it before.

1918
01:24:30,301 --> 01:24:31,960
So needless to say,
my eyes blew up and I never close.

1919
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,130
I could almost see anything anymore and 
we all wanted to go out and um,

1920
01:24:36,270 --> 01:24:39,430
and it guy there and he goes,
what are you going to do?

1921
01:24:39,431 --> 01:24:39,840
I said,
well,

1922
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:41,200
give me one second ahead of the doctor 
with me.

1923
01:24:41,201 --> 01:24:42,200
I say,
give me the,

1924
01:24:42,230 --> 01:24:44,290
the syringe with the widest couch,
you know,

1925
01:24:44,291 --> 01:24:49,291
so I stabbed in my eye and I stopped 
sucking the blood out yet.

1926
01:24:49,870 --> 01:24:53,170
But that's when I heard he told that 
story and he goes,

1927
01:24:53,550 --> 01:24:58,120
and this guy still see me in the Dah,
Dah slugging it out.

1928
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:01,300
He puts some shade.
So like the freaking terminator.

1929
01:25:01,450 --> 01:25:02,350
And he says,
come on,

1930
01:25:02,351 --> 01:25:07,351
let's go do my accent.
That's what I heard that I go to now.

1931
01:25:12,570 --> 01:25:14,260
Now you see when you go back in time,
you go,

1932
01:25:14,261 --> 01:25:15,470
yeah,
that was maybe a weird thing to.

1933
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:17,740
Right.
So you stuck them in your eyelids.

1934
01:25:17,741 --> 01:25:20,390
Like where did.
Yeah.

1935
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:23,540
And I tried to find you,
you pull just nothing coming out.

1936
01:25:23,541 --> 01:25:25,120
You'd have a little further and suddenly
you get blocked.

1937
01:25:25,450 --> 01:25:28,510
When you do a blood test,
you're still just start pulling,

1938
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:33,870
you know.
And then I did and I could see again 

1939
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:36,481
Jesus Terminator.
That is so ridiculous.

1940
01:25:38,190 --> 01:25:40,510
That is how many people have done that.

1941
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:49,540
That's a super rare move.
Stick a fucking needle under the bag 

1942
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:52,660
under your arm and suck blood out of it.
I'd say you're in a very rare company to

1943
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:55,980
try to try to stitch yourself up with,
uh,

1944
01:25:55,990 --> 01:25:57,730
with normal needles.
I did that as well.

1945
01:25:57,731 --> 01:26:00,160
I put a video in a long time ago.
My wife at the beginning said,

1946
01:26:00,161 --> 01:26:04,150
don't tell her that you were with your 
daughters yourself up.

1947
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:09,190
My daughter's filming.
The other one is playing music of the 

1948
01:26:09,190 --> 01:26:11,600
fence.
The dog is walking over my lack 

1949
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:12,030
stinking,
super,

1950
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:14,080
super antiseptic.
Oh,

1951
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:15,210
you see this,
this third.

1952
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:16,680
Oh,
you're fired a fast.

1953
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:21,740
What was that cut from it.
People won't believe it.

1954
01:26:21,770 --> 01:26:26,420
I at the time I drank nonalcoholic beer 
and I walk outside and I grab a six pack

1955
01:26:26,421 --> 01:26:27,620
of blackstone,
Alcoholic Beer.

1956
01:26:27,621 --> 01:26:30,040
I walk back in the six pack,
breaks the bottles,

1957
01:26:30,050 --> 01:26:32,330
hit the ground,
and it shoots against my leg.

1958
01:26:32,330 --> 01:26:34,400
And I walk inside and they go,
man,

1959
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:35,660
this hurts,
right?

1960
01:26:35,661 --> 01:26:40,661
There's this weird.
And then I walk a few steps and this is 

1961
01:26:40,661 --> 01:26:40,661
crazy.
So I pulled my pants down and I saw that

1962
01:26:40,661 --> 01:26:42,710
cut.
The piece of glass was still in it,

1963
01:26:43,290 --> 01:26:47,620
so I had to pull it out and not go to an
actual doctor.

1964
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:52,640
Okay.
Because my wife was in Holland at the 

1965
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:52,640
last time I did that.
I was A.

1966
01:26:53,090 --> 01:26:57,560
I overtrained in the sun for a promotion
for the body action system and I have to

1967
01:26:57,561 --> 01:27:01,280
go to the hospital because I was 93 
degrees my body.

1968
01:27:01,281 --> 01:27:03,020
I crying,
I couldn't hold anything anymore.

1969
01:27:03,021 --> 01:27:04,760
Everything started cramping.
It was the weirdest thing.

1970
01:27:04,761 --> 01:27:06,560
So they had to.
This was like when you were filming that

1971
01:27:06,561 --> 01:27:08,010
commercial?
No,

1972
01:27:08,210 --> 01:27:13,210
I did a workout video workout.
I did the whole workout into at noon in 

1973
01:27:13,210 --> 01:27:16,600
the son Jesus on the top and how much I 
wanted to look good on the camera.

1974
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:18,410
So I was hitting the thing as hard as I 
could,

1975
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:21,410
you know.
And then of course I took all potassium.

1976
01:27:21,411 --> 01:27:23,240
I tried every because I knew what this 
was going to happen,

1977
01:27:23,241 --> 01:27:27,200
but still I started cramping crazy.
So I went to the hospital,

1978
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:32,560
they put like two backs in me,
then they put another two bags and the 

1979
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:33,590
bags are empty and it's and um,
we'd been there for a long time and have

1980
01:27:33,591 --> 01:27:38,591
my kids with me because my wife is in 
Holland so they're there with me and 

1981
01:27:38,591 --> 01:27:42,581
it's 4:00
in the morning now and they still don't 

1982
01:27:42,581 --> 01:27:42,581
come back and it's already like an hour 
and a half.

1983
01:27:42,581 --> 01:27:43,270
And I've been asking them and I,
you know,

1984
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:44,810
I get angry.
So I say,

1985
01:27:44,820 --> 01:27:46,480
you know what,
let's go guilt.

1986
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:49,160
What you'd never should do is pull it 
out yourself.

1987
01:27:49,161 --> 01:27:50,960
If you do that,
you need to put pressure on there.

1988
01:27:50,961 --> 01:27:54,090
And now I know why that is because I 
sprayed the whole room full of blood.

1989
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:00,830
So then my,
my daughters had hold your finger on,

1990
01:28:00,831 --> 01:28:03,230
the other one is I pulled it out to say 
I know we got to run.

1991
01:28:03,290 --> 01:28:07,490
So we run out of the hospital and escape
the hospital,

1992
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,800
escaped the hospital because I was 
dehydrated.

1993
01:28:10,130 --> 01:28:15,130
So then my wife has gone again and this 
thing happens and she already didn't 

1994
01:28:15,130 --> 01:28:16,340
like it.
That something crazy at the first time.

1995
01:28:16,490 --> 01:28:17,360
So I go,
you know what,

1996
01:28:17,361 --> 01:28:19,310
I'm not going to go to the hospital.
I'm going to be there again.

1997
01:28:19,311 --> 01:28:21,770
It's become this big story.
I'm just going to stitch it myself.

1998
01:28:21,771 --> 01:28:26,750
So I asked the girls to find a needle 
for first like they do,

1999
01:28:26,751 --> 01:28:31,751
but it broke and I go no.
And then we followed one more left and 

2000
01:28:31,751 --> 01:28:33,860
they're really not sharp.
You gotta really push to get it in there

2001
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:35,510
and uh,
but it worked.

2002
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:37,190
It worked out perfect.
I cleaned everything.

2003
01:28:37,191 --> 01:28:39,470
I cleaned the rope with alcohol swipes,
all that stuff.

2004
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:44,820
And I start stitching it and uh,
well not much I can do my,

2005
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:46,190
my daughter,
I go like,

2006
01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:47,550
I say,
oh,

2007
01:28:47,551 --> 01:28:48,740
it's just like Rambo.
I said,

2008
01:28:48,741 --> 01:28:50,060
and she goes,
who is,

2009
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:52,220
who is Rambo Daddy?
Did he do it too?

2010
01:28:52,221 --> 01:28:52,650
I said,
yeah,

2011
01:28:52,651 --> 01:28:53,270
yeah,
you do.

2012
01:28:53,630 --> 01:28:54,250
But who is she?
Oh,

2013
01:28:54,251 --> 01:28:54,860
sorry,
he's an actor.

2014
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:55,610
He's.
Oh,

2015
01:28:55,611 --> 01:28:57,230
it was a movie.
Yeah,

2016
01:28:57,340 --> 01:28:59,870
it was in the movie.
So he did not do it for real.

2017
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:01,520
Maybe you should do it.

2018
01:29:06,270 --> 01:29:11,270
Stitch themselves up either if you get 
like a first aid kit with needles and 

2019
01:29:11,530 --> 01:29:12,360
needle.
Yeah,

2020
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,040
because if you have one of those 
needles,

2021
01:29:14,041 --> 01:29:15,510
you know the little round ones,
the hooks,

2022
01:29:15,570 --> 01:29:20,570
it's an easy thing.
You go really fast but you slip off 

2023
01:29:20,570 --> 01:29:20,730
because it's,
you know,

2024
01:29:20,740 --> 01:29:25,740
everyday the hardest things to go in.
So what you need to do it when you have 

2025
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:25,740
the cut,
like for instance,

2026
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:28,740
if the one side,
this one here's the cut and here right.

2027
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:34,160
You have to put your finger underneath 
so make your finger underneath and then 

2028
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:37,611
you have to stab the needle there 
because otherwise every time what 

2029
01:29:37,611 --> 01:29:37,611
happens is this,
it slips off.

2030
01:29:37,611 --> 01:29:39,480
It doesn't go in.
So you had to put my finger on an IV,

2031
01:29:39,690 --> 01:29:44,690
going out what's easier.
So once you're from the inside going 

2032
01:29:44,690 --> 01:29:44,690
out,
that was easier to do.

2033
01:29:44,690 --> 01:29:48,920
But the going in part,
that was hard because it kept slipping 

2034
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:48,920
in.
It was not a really sharp new.

2035
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:50,610
Well yeah,
that seems like a lot of work.

2036
01:29:51,210 --> 01:29:56,210
Yeah.
But it's better go to the hospital for 

2037
01:29:56,210 --> 01:29:56,600
four hours.
A crazy glued.

2038
01:29:56,610 --> 01:29:58,770
Something crazy.
Gluco all my students.

2039
01:29:58,771 --> 01:29:59,010
Yeah.

2040
01:30:01,170 --> 01:30:03,330
I got to go into the doctor.
Come here.

2041
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:09,440
Who really works the best as long as 
your finger doesn't get stuck on the 

2042
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:12,660
wound as you're applying it.
Oh,

2043
01:30:12,690 --> 01:30:15,860
who said that?
Somebody did that for fun with a friends

2044
01:30:15,861 --> 01:30:16,980
with his mouth.
Oh,

2045
01:30:16,981 --> 01:30:20,870
that's good for lips.
Ripped apart.

2046
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:25,980
Scar tissue over your lips.
You don't want to hit the dumbest thing 

2047
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:25,980
I've ever seen.
It was a guy in Holland.

2048
01:30:26,450 --> 01:30:31,450
They.
They challenged him to put a pool ball 

2049
01:30:31,450 --> 01:30:31,450
into his mouth.
Oh fuck.

2050
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:33,780
So once it was in,
he did get it out.

2051
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:36,750
They had to break stitch out to get them
out.

2052
01:30:36,810 --> 01:30:41,810
Yet he almost couldn't breathe with.
Gets the freaking ball was in his mouth.

2053
01:30:43,210 --> 01:30:48,210
Fix it to the next level is Christ.
Fucking Christ had a break his teeth at 

2054
01:30:51,161 --> 01:30:52,030
the break.
Steve Thought,

2055
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:54,860
oh my God.
What a fucking retard.

2056
01:31:00,620 --> 01:31:03,080
Oh my God.
Can you do it?

2057
01:31:03,081 --> 01:31:04,670
Yeah.
What are you fucking three,

2058
01:31:05,590 --> 01:31:07,550
three year old.
Don't put that ball in your mouth.

2059
01:31:07,850 --> 01:31:10,160
Probably with alcohol or you can't do 
it.

2060
01:31:10,190 --> 01:31:10,950
Oh No,
no.

2061
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:13,220
That is a problem.
Yeah.

2062
01:31:13,730 --> 01:31:15,290
Wow.
God damn alcohol.

2063
01:31:18,630 --> 01:31:22,890
So what is going on with inside mma?
Yeah,

2064
01:31:22,891 --> 01:31:24,230
just fake.
Just stopped.

2065
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:27,490
I just stopped before that.
How long did you guys do it for?

2066
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:29,140
Nine years.
Nine years.

2067
01:31:29,141 --> 01:31:30,150
I did I think nine show.

2068
01:31:31,690 --> 01:31:33,670
Yeah.
If I made that quota

2069
01:31:34,390 --> 01:31:39,390
nine years and then they just decided.
I mean it was one of the most respected 

2070
01:31:39,390 --> 01:31:43,390
independent MMA shows on TV.
I love it,

2071
01:31:43,391 --> 01:31:44,860
you know,
it was a really guy.

2072
01:31:44,861 --> 01:31:47,800
I would have loved to have a little bit 
more heads up what you know.

2073
01:31:47,801 --> 01:31:48,190
Well,
Hey,

2074
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:50,470
when,
when does a problem time slot sucked?

2075
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:54,880
That was the thing at the end do to,
to go 9:30

2076
01:31:55,540 --> 01:31:58,510
Pacific time.
The,

2077
01:31:58,990 --> 01:31:59,980
the east coast.
She's shut

2078
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:02,740
everything down.
It was the most dvr show they said.

2079
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:04,960
Yeah,
well I'm sure.

2080
01:32:04,990 --> 01:32:07,490
But people like to watch things when 
their current too.

2081
01:32:07,970 --> 01:32:10,850
They have it at like 6:00
PM on a weeknight,

2082
01:32:11,930 --> 01:32:16,930
what we've been saying,
or several nights nights where you want 

2083
01:32:16,930 --> 01:32:17,110
to be,
you know,

2084
01:32:17,170 --> 01:32:19,930
to be on a Friday night.
Like everyone's going.

2085
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:23,200
Yeah,
they go out and show them.

2086
01:32:23,201 --> 01:32:24,550
Man,
it was a fun show.

2087
01:32:24,551 --> 01:32:25,900
We had a good run,
you know,

2088
01:32:25,901 --> 01:32:26,490
and uh,
we're,

2089
01:32:26,491 --> 01:32:31,491
we're,
we're back together to get her audio 

2090
01:32:31,491 --> 01:32:31,491
version of inside mma,
I guess,

2091
01:32:31,491 --> 01:32:33,340
although we talk a other combat sports 
as well.

2092
01:32:33,370 --> 01:32:35,950
Mondays we drop the combat sports 
carousel,

2093
01:32:35,951 --> 01:32:37,210
buzzy Bazuto,
that's what it is.

2094
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:43,100
And then we do a routine and Ramallah,
which is more us just riffing on pop 

2095
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:46,060
culture events and try to add some 
positivity to try to find some good news

2096
01:32:46,061 --> 01:32:49,390
stories to share in this deeply divided 
world of ours.

2097
01:32:49,390 --> 01:32:50,390
So yeah,
we just uh,

2098
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:52,660
we enjoy working with each other and 
it's been a,

2099
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:55,300
uh,
a blessing to be a reunited with them in

2100
01:32:55,301 --> 01:32:56,860
here.
You're a busy dude,

2101
01:32:56,861 --> 01:32:59,160
man.
Are you still doing boxing commentary as

2102
01:32:59,170 --> 01:33:00,890
well?
Debbie?

2103
01:33:01,890 --> 01:33:06,130
Tupac pen and Glorious and well,
maybe not so much shitty longer,

2104
01:33:06,131 --> 01:33:09,340
although glory will always remain a very
near and dear to me.

2105
01:33:09,341 --> 01:33:12,460
But uh,
so timing and did they were upset that I

2106
01:33:12,461 --> 01:33:15,010
didn't go to Germany because I had a 
boxing event that night.

2107
01:33:15,050 --> 01:33:18,190
Showtime is a first priority so we'll 
see.

2108
01:33:18,191 --> 01:33:18,650
But,
uh,

2109
01:33:18,670 --> 01:33:19,120
but yeah,
I'm,

2110
01:33:19,130 --> 01:33:23,110
I'm doing a championship double header 
on Saturday at Barclays on showtime.

2111
01:33:23,111 --> 01:33:26,140
Where a unification fight,
which I think this year in boxing,

2112
01:33:26,141 --> 01:33:29,900
because not a great year last year for 
the sweet science and uh,

2113
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:33,250
we're going to try to hopefully see more
of the best fighting the best finally.

2114
01:33:33,251 --> 01:33:34,500
And I think again,
you know,

2115
01:33:34,510 --> 01:33:37,930
people can say what they want about him,
it may match making everything else.

2116
01:33:37,930 --> 01:33:39,800
But the one thing I've always liked 
about mma,

2117
01:33:39,850 --> 01:33:42,220
eventually you will see those,
the best fight,

2118
01:33:42,221 --> 01:33:45,430
the best.
And in boxing the politics and the money

2119
01:33:46,330 --> 01:33:51,330
kept that from happening.
Well that was the thing that kept fade 

2120
01:33:51,330 --> 01:33:51,330
or out of the UFC,
you know,

2121
01:33:51,330 --> 01:33:52,750
they wanted his own promotion.
Yeah.

2122
01:33:52,751 --> 01:33:55,860
They want to code promotion.
We see how it helped us strike.

2123
01:33:55,930 --> 01:33:58,210
I mean,
I think everyone knows this by now.

2124
01:33:58,211 --> 01:34:03,211
That was the deal that broke the 
proverbial camel's back with 

2125
01:34:03,211 --> 01:34:03,211
strikeforce.
And showtime,

2126
01:34:03,211 --> 01:34:05,410
uh,
was the fader after he lost the,

2127
01:34:05,411 --> 01:34:06,680
they,
you know,

2128
01:34:07,910 --> 01:34:11,080
wanted to resign fader at that amount of
money.

2129
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:13,820
A showtime.
The boss at the time said,

2130
01:34:13,821 --> 01:34:18,821
you know,
we need a fader or we're not going to 

2131
01:34:18,821 --> 01:34:19,540
renew the deal.
And Doug strike forces owners,

2132
01:34:19,550 --> 01:34:21,520
the sharks at the time with coker,
uh,

2133
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:25,240
they wanted out.
So that kind of set the ball in motion I

2134
01:34:25,241 --> 01:34:30,241
think to because I thought and I think 
it would have still been very healthy 

2135
01:34:30,241 --> 01:34:30,241
for the sport.

2136
01:34:30,241 --> 01:34:34,860
I thought strikeforce and the UFC man,
that was some good shows in strikeforce 

2137
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:34,860
as we know.
Look what the,

2138
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:37,270
the alum have done in the UFC.
Amazing Organization,

2139
01:34:37,271 --> 01:34:37,990
man.
Yeah.

2140
01:34:37,991 --> 01:34:42,991
Between strikeforce and in WEC.
I mean there's been a quite a few 

2141
01:34:42,991 --> 01:34:45,700
champions that have come from both those
elements and smart move by the UFC to,

2142
01:34:45,740 --> 01:34:48,470
to do what they did to make sure they 
got exactly what I was.

2143
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:53,480
A very smart move.
But there is something to be said for 

2144
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:53,480
competition for sure.
You know.

2145
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:53,880
And uh,
I'm,

2146
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:55,240
I'm really.
First of all,

2147
01:34:55,241 --> 01:34:58,370
I'm glad there's other combat sports are
getting more and more popular.

2148
01:34:58,370 --> 01:35:03,370
Like Bella tour.
Take boxing liked glory to glory is a 

2149
01:35:03,370 --> 01:35:05,190
very,
a very prevalent.

2150
01:35:05,270 --> 01:35:06,080
We know,
but you,

2151
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:08,360
you've helped push that needle as well.
My man.

2152
01:35:08,361 --> 01:35:10,610
And it's,
I'm glad because I think for me,

2153
01:35:10,611 --> 01:35:15,611
bud calling all these combat sports that
we've called in this society in the 21st

2154
01:35:15,711 --> 01:35:17,900
century,
kickboxing at the highest level,

2155
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:20,000
I,
I pick it over everything.

2156
01:35:20,270 --> 01:35:22,550
It's one of the most exciting sports in 
the world for sure.

2157
01:35:22,580 --> 01:35:27,580
Without a doubt.
And one of the things about glory is 

2158
01:35:27,580 --> 01:35:27,580
that you know,
you.

2159
01:35:27,580 --> 01:35:31,720
This is,
even though it's an organization that 

2160
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:31,720
may be a lot of people have not totally 
become aware of.

2161
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:33,650
Sure.
There's world class world,

2162
01:35:33,651 --> 01:35:37,640
championship level talent.
The talent is not like at a low level at

2163
01:35:37,641 --> 01:35:42,641
all.
When you got guys like Niki hold skin 

2164
01:35:42,641 --> 01:35:42,670
and you know what I mean,
there's so much good.

2165
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:45,470
But it's again comes.

2166
01:35:45,470 --> 01:35:46,220
Okay,
let me go.

2167
01:35:47,490 --> 01:35:49,040
Why?
Why do you think it?

2168
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:54,910
Everyone says we need American stars.
Just like with you and you know 

2169
01:35:54,910 --> 01:35:54,910
everything.
Is that.

2170
01:35:54,910 --> 01:35:56,870
Why do you think Laurie is not making a 
bigger imprint right now in America?

2171
01:35:56,900 --> 01:36:01,900
It's a good question.
I wish I had the answer to because 

2172
01:36:01,900 --> 01:36:02,530
there's a lot of combat pilots already.
I mean the doc would have how many shows

2173
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,970
they go to UFC.
So if you look at all the other ones,

2174
01:36:04,971 --> 01:36:07,190
but I don't know,
I understand that or not.

2175
01:36:07,210 --> 01:36:12,210
I think that's also very valuable to me.
Nothing drives me more insane than 

2176
01:36:12,210 --> 01:36:17,080
hearing mma fans.
Boo and incredible ground game or two 

2177
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:17,930
athletes.
So I'm just saying,

2178
01:36:17,931 --> 01:36:19,190
hey,
if there's that segment,

2179
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:23,180
there is this thing called glory.
Kickboxing is on UFC fight pass to now.

2180
01:36:23,181 --> 01:36:28,181
It's just I,
I'm just a little surprised in a 

2181
01:36:28,181 --> 01:36:30,890
disappointed that it hasn't gotten a 
little more traction because these guys 

2182
01:36:30,890 --> 01:36:31,280
deserve it.

2183
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:32,960
Man.
It's weird.

2184
01:36:33,290 --> 01:36:35,330
It's weird.
I think boss nailed it though.

2185
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:37,160
I think there's too much to watch 
already.

2186
01:36:37,190 --> 01:36:42,190
Well look,
we do this for a living and I don't 

2187
01:36:42,190 --> 01:36:42,190
know.
I'm,

2188
01:36:42,190 --> 01:36:42,190
you're,
you're,

2189
01:36:42,190 --> 01:36:42,190
you're,
you're watching everything.

2190
01:36:42,190 --> 01:36:45,431
I can't keep up anymore when I'm on the 
road doing wwe and UFC and a single bed.

2191
01:36:45,501 --> 01:36:46,220
Yeah.
Like I'll,

2192
01:36:46,370 --> 01:36:51,370
I'll watch.
I have to tape everything just so fast 

2193
01:36:51,370 --> 01:36:51,370
forward and,
and like you say to save time,

2194
01:36:51,370 --> 01:36:51,930
Joan,
it's,

2195
01:36:51,931 --> 01:36:52,640
it's,
you know,

2196
01:36:52,641 --> 01:36:57,641
I can't,
don't dedicate six hours because I only 

2197
01:36:57,641 --> 01:36:59,960
got two or three and I still want to 
follow in cover and yeah.

2198
01:36:59,961 --> 01:37:02,930
And then if you want to file Moitai,
good luck with all of luck with all that

2199
01:37:02,931 --> 01:37:03,680
as well.
Yeah,

2200
01:37:03,681 --> 01:37:05,270
I mean there's just too many.
Too much.

2201
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:10,600
You're writing what size?
The hardest thing to watch in terms of 

2202
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:11,210
like get it live on television paper for
you.

2203
01:37:11,390 --> 01:37:14,000
I mean if some worldclass fights that 
are going on right now and there's no.

2204
01:37:14,020 --> 01:37:17,780
There's a lot of times there's no way to
get more type premier league remembering

2205
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:22,790
again was there all these.
Nikki goes great,

2206
01:37:22,791 --> 01:37:24,320
but boom,
still owe me money.

2207
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:26,530
They do that.
Of course they did.

2208
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:30,690
Somebody organizations only money.
It is what it is.

2209
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:35,800
That was a good organization.
They put together a good event rather 

2210
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:35,810
than together a great event.
And.

2211
01:37:35,811 --> 01:37:38,160
But I think in the boycott was there 
were a couple corporate.

2212
01:37:38,161 --> 01:37:39,440
Yeah,
exactly.

2213
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:44,420
I think the world class more time 
worldclass a kickboxing or greatly.

2214
01:37:44,421 --> 01:37:47,330
Greatly underappreciated.
I think fight pass.

2215
01:37:47,331 --> 01:37:52,331
I mean the ESPN deal.
I think this helped a little bit and of 

2216
01:37:52,331 --> 01:37:52,331
course being on fight pass.
I hope it was also.

2217
01:37:52,331 --> 01:37:56,691
I mean,
when I was doing the shows and keeping 

2218
01:37:56,691 --> 01:37:56,691
track of social media,
you know,

2219
01:37:56,691 --> 01:37:57,000
there is growth.

2220
01:37:57,030 --> 01:38:02,030
It's not,
I don't think stagnated by any stretch 

2221
01:38:02,030 --> 01:38:02,030
of the imagination,
but again,

2222
01:38:02,030 --> 01:38:02,520
it's in Europe.
It is,

2223
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:04,440
it is popular.
Very good ratings,

2224
01:38:04,441 --> 01:38:04,900
right?
Uh,

2225
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:08,460
the Netherlands and by not an ultimate 
fighter of show,

2226
01:38:08,461 --> 01:38:09,810
we've talked about that.
Boxing.

2227
01:38:09,890 --> 01:38:11,470
I asked anybody gives a fuck about 
those,

2228
01:38:11,540 --> 01:38:14,320
those as well where we have a problem.
Yup.

2229
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:15,320
You know,
I think,

2230
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:17,790
I think people have seen too much 
reality TV.

2231
01:38:17,791 --> 01:38:22,791
I think the novelty of it all wore off.
I think when forrest griffin and Stephan

2232
01:38:24,210 --> 01:38:26,190
Bonner went to war and season one and 
that whole,

2233
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:30,330
that whole cast with Kenny Florian,
Diego Sanchez and it just,

2234
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:31,010
it,
it was,

2235
01:38:31,070 --> 01:38:36,070
it was something special.
But then that was also before like the 

2236
01:38:36,070 --> 01:38:37,370
real housewives and a million different 
photos.

2237
01:38:38,140 --> 01:38:43,140
That TV in general,
like a member who wants to be a 

2238
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:43,140
millionaire when the was on one night,
25,

2239
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:44,250
30 million.
That'll kick two nights,

2240
01:38:44,251 --> 01:38:44,670
three nights.

2241
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:48,330
It's like everything else we do in life 
when it's good or when it's successful.

2242
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:53,360
Let's keep going.
Let's keep going until they run it into 

2243
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:53,360
the ground.
Yeah,

2244
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:53,360
and it's also,
there's style,

2245
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:57,950
there's trends.
People just get excited about certain 

2246
01:38:57,950 --> 01:39:01,101
trends.
Then they get bored of certain trends 

2247
01:39:01,101 --> 01:39:02,841
and I think reality shows in general,
I think it's hard for people to get 

2248
01:39:02,881 --> 01:39:07,881
excited about a new one.
So if you had a new one is just about a 

2249
01:39:07,881 --> 01:39:10,311
bunch of kickbox almost got to be 
something more than what it would be 

2250
01:39:10,311 --> 01:39:12,340
something for either a fight or Netflix.
You know,

2251
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:17,360
why you can watch it in one time.
I think Netflix is the way to go 

2252
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:19,240
nowadays because you decide when you 
want to write,

2253
01:39:19,490 --> 01:39:24,490
not just netflix and Amazon.
You've got a special on Netflix as well 

2254
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:26,790
with everything,
right?

2255
01:39:26,791 --> 01:39:27,230
Like,
uh,

2256
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:29,960
we're,
we're then that's why to me kickboxing,

2257
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:30,690
grieving him at me.

2258
01:39:30,810 --> 01:39:32,440
You can go like on your phone right 
away.

2259
01:39:32,441 --> 01:39:33,010
Here.
Okay.

2260
01:39:33,011 --> 01:39:33,900
I got three minutes.
Boom.

2261
01:39:33,901 --> 01:39:34,920
What a fight.
Great stuff.

2262
01:39:34,921 --> 01:39:35,520
Okay.
I'm done.

2263
01:39:35,521 --> 01:39:38,770
Like it's digestible in those tiny 
morsel.

2264
01:39:38,771 --> 01:39:41,170
But how do you monetize it?
How do you build a,

2265
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:44,130
uh,
an audience that's consistent?

2266
01:39:44,450 --> 01:39:46,740
Well,
I think it's going to be a slow build.

2267
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:49,500
It's not going to be like the UFC,
which kind of exploded,

2268
01:39:49,501 --> 01:39:52,860
blow from the ultimate fighter and most 
sports don't explode like that.

2269
01:39:52,861 --> 01:39:56,760
They take a long time and several 
generations to build a mma.

2270
01:39:56,780 --> 01:40:01,780
It was so unusual in that it the 
excitement level from watching a high 

2271
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:06,021
level of fight was irrefutable to the 
point where when people would watch 

2272
01:40:06,021 --> 01:40:10,281
fights on TV,
they'd be so crazy and so exciting that 

2273
01:40:10,281 --> 01:40:10,470
it was almost like undeniable.
Yeah,

2274
01:40:10,471 --> 01:40:12,840
you had to watch him.
He's just too many people watching.

2275
01:40:13,070 --> 01:40:13,860
Can take your eyes off of it.

2276
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:17,730
That's the difference between,
I think kickboxing,

2277
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,950
it just.
The gloves are bigger.

2278
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:26,060
They definitely ponds but doing that 
cage boy time.

2279
01:40:27,030 --> 01:40:27,960
Yep,
Yep.

2280
01:40:28,170 --> 01:40:29,790
That's not a bad idea.
It's a good idea,

2281
01:40:29,820 --> 01:40:31,350
but then you know,
you see it in a cage like,

2282
01:40:31,351 --> 01:40:32,340
well,
why can't he take them down?

2283
01:40:33,150 --> 01:40:38,150
I can always do a flying arm bar.
Yeah.

2284
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:42,180
That's fun.
We can do a lot of things.

2285
01:40:42,570 --> 01:40:47,570
Yeah,
I mean I think the sport is still 

2286
01:40:47,570 --> 01:40:48,060
growing phases.
I think as far as the talent level,

2287
01:40:48,061 --> 01:40:50,880
you definitely seeing what's going on in
women's mma.

2288
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:54,370
Women's MMA is changing pretty radically
and quickly.

2289
01:40:54,610 --> 01:40:55,230
Yeah.
Yeah.

2290
01:40:55,250 --> 01:40:55,800
We saw that.

2291
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:00,480
I mean,
look at a water sitting in Paige vanzant

2292
01:41:00,481 --> 01:41:01,770
for variety of reasons.
Again,

2293
01:41:01,771 --> 01:41:05,310
that's an eight.
It's weird how our society,

2294
01:41:05,311 --> 01:41:07,050
we're fixated the,
you know,

2295
01:41:07,051 --> 01:41:10,470
the good looking people who can fight 
are getting these huge numbers.

2296
01:41:10,471 --> 01:41:12,630
Where shouldn't it just be in this 
sport?

2297
01:41:12,631 --> 01:41:13,530
Okay.
You're a fighter,

2298
01:41:13,531 --> 01:41:15,330
you're talented fighter and I know for 
some,

2299
01:41:15,331 --> 01:41:19,770
but it just seems like America 
especially is about the cosmetics,

2300
01:41:19,771 --> 01:41:20,220
right?
Well,

2301
01:41:20,650 --> 01:41:22,930
Sorta,
but I don't know if that's totally fair.

2302
01:41:24,590 --> 01:41:27,490
I think what we have is we have this 
giant pool of hardcore fans,

2303
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:28,130
right?
Yup.

2304
01:41:28,450 --> 01:41:31,480
Who want to watch a tyron woodley versus
wonderboy too.

2305
01:41:31,510 --> 01:41:32,000
They want,
you know,

2306
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:33,870
people want to watch this really good 
fights.

2307
01:41:33,910 --> 01:41:35,680
Exactly.
There's that and,

2308
01:41:35,681 --> 01:41:38,080
but in order to make the really big 
money,

2309
01:41:38,380 --> 01:41:41,360
you got to go outside of those folks and
yeah,

2310
01:41:41,380 --> 01:41:46,380
get that casual fan and also generate 
interest in 100 percent of the hardcore 

2311
01:41:46,380 --> 01:41:48,970
fans because there's some hardcore fans 
that quite honestly,

2312
01:41:48,971 --> 01:41:50,050
we'll look at a fire and go,
you know,

2313
01:41:50,051 --> 01:41:55,051
I don't really give a fuck about that 
fight for whatever reason that fights 

2314
01:41:55,051 --> 01:41:55,051
not my fight.
I don't want to watch it.

2315
01:41:55,150 --> 01:41:57,940
And so that's a big pay per view night 
for the UFC.

2316
01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:00,970
There's a certain percentage of even the
hardcore fans at it say,

2317
01:42:00,971 --> 01:42:05,971
you know what,
I feel better saving my 60 bucks and 

2318
01:42:05,971 --> 01:42:06,130
then I'll find out an hour later who 
want anyway.

2319
01:42:06,590 --> 01:42:07,370
And unfortunately

2320
01:42:07,810 --> 01:42:11,310
time before Mcgregor came,
it's always the lighter weight classes.

2321
01:42:11,330 --> 01:42:11,950
Right?
Yeah.

2322
01:42:12,020 --> 01:42:13,140
And that's a shame.
Here's the.

2323
01:42:14,010 --> 01:42:16,920
Is the roster too big you think for the 
UFC in that respect?

2324
01:42:16,921 --> 01:42:18,450
Like are you.
Because even as we say,

2325
01:42:18,451 --> 01:42:19,980
we covered this,
we hardcore like it's,

2326
01:42:20,130 --> 01:42:25,130
there's,
there's a lot of fighters on the coil 

2327
01:42:25,130 --> 01:42:25,130
wire,
you know,

2328
01:42:25,130 --> 01:42:25,130
okay,
this guy,

2329
01:42:25,130 --> 01:42:25,130
the guy got to fill out the cards.
I'm just wondering,

2330
01:42:25,130 --> 01:42:27,330
for guy you covers a,
does it works for the company,

2331
01:42:27,510 --> 01:42:32,510
do you think there's the roster is it's 
too big or you're happy with the way it 

2332
01:42:32,510 --> 01:42:32,510
is

2333
01:42:32,510 --> 01:42:34,260
now in terms of Mike's fights?
Right,

2334
01:42:34,261 --> 01:42:37,960
so if I said that I would really have to
do research before I save the rosters to

2335
01:42:37,980 --> 01:42:42,980
big,
but if they don't fight for if in this 

2336
01:42:42,980 --> 01:42:47,451
roster,
the question then becomes where do they 

2337
01:42:47,451 --> 01:42:50,751
fight because they have to get fight 
somewhere and would it be better for 

2338
01:42:50,751 --> 01:42:51,540
some of these lighter?
Not Lighter,

2339
01:42:51,541 --> 01:42:54,750
but a lighter inexperienced guys like a 
Mickey Golf for instance,

2340
01:42:54,870 --> 01:42:58,920
who just right away now he's fighting in
the UFC and beat sage northcutts on Holy

2341
01:42:58,920 --> 01:42:59,820
Shit.
Now the kid's a star,

2342
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:05,000
right?
He beats up on my phone because the 

2343
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:09,760
smart so now,
but he's also only a couple of fights 

2344
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:13,851
into his career.
If you were his manager and you cared 

2345
01:43:13,851 --> 01:43:14,130
about them a lot and you're saying,
look kid,

2346
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:16,320
you're really good.
He got real potential,

2347
01:43:16,321 --> 01:43:21,321
but you need to get some seasoning and 
you need to get some seasoning and 

2348
01:43:21,321 --> 01:43:22,020
against commensurate talent.
You know you want.

2349
01:43:22,021 --> 01:43:27,021
You want to fight guys that offer a 
threat but that you can beat and you 

2350
01:43:27,021 --> 01:43:28,200
want to build your way up to a guy like 
Damien Maia.

2351
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:30,450
Right?
But if you fight Damien Maia today,

2352
01:43:30,630 --> 01:43:35,630
you're probably going to get fucking 
smushed good and you might get smushed 

2353
01:43:35,630 --> 01:43:38,340
in a way that might destroy your 
confidence for fucking years,

2354
01:43:38,780 --> 01:43:41,600
but then there's.
I guess there's a feeder leagues,

2355
01:43:41,601 --> 01:43:42,710
right?
Access TV.

2356
01:43:42,711 --> 01:43:44,240
What has done a good job?
RFA,

2357
01:43:44,241 --> 01:43:49,241
all these other groups.
I'm wondering the UFC if they want to 

2358
01:43:49,241 --> 01:43:49,850
even invest to invest in something like 
that.

2359
01:43:49,910 --> 01:43:51,980
Limited TV show of it now looking for

2360
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:53,990
a fight so they.
I don't think they will do that,

2361
01:43:53,991 --> 01:43:58,991
but I always thought that they should do
an amateur division or something to use 

2362
01:43:58,991 --> 01:44:02,450
an image of the vision.
That's kind of cool because you're wind 

2363
01:44:02,450 --> 01:44:02,540
micky gall I think has potential to be a
superstar,

2364
01:44:02,541 --> 01:44:05,090
but if you're already.
He already beat north.

2365
01:44:05,091 --> 01:44:06,180
Y'all already been six.
Northcott,

2366
01:44:07,290 --> 01:44:08,510
Northcott.
Who's going to fight next?

2367
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:12,560
Maybe barring Barberino.
If he fights in,

2368
01:44:12,561 --> 01:44:15,750
keeps winning like he's.
He's not too far out of a top 20 ranked.

2369
01:44:16,690 --> 01:44:17,810
Then all of a sudden you're in the 
wolves,

2370
01:44:17,811 --> 01:44:18,460
Dan.
I mean,

2371
01:44:18,470 --> 01:44:19,630
maybe he's cool with that.
Maybe.

2372
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:21,110
Look,
Jon Jones did it.

2373
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:21,490
Yup.

2374
01:44:23,730 --> 01:44:25,750
How many fucking people are John Jones?
Yep.

2375
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:26,570
No,
you're right.

2376
01:44:26,630 --> 01:44:31,630
When you get that kind of talent,
that's how Jon Jones is a real special 

2377
01:44:31,630 --> 01:44:31,630
talent.
That's really.

2378
01:44:31,630 --> 01:44:36,440
It's undeniable takedowns.
He hit on Dan Henderson pure grappling 

2379
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:40,540
match.
Oh yeah.

2380
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:41,930
He can do anything.
That's what I like.

2381
01:44:41,931 --> 01:44:43,490
He could submit you.
He can knock you out.

2382
01:44:43,491 --> 01:44:48,491
It's just.
He really thinks about his fight in the 

2383
01:44:48,491 --> 01:44:49,100
coordinated for a guy that size under 
pressure.

2384
01:44:49,101 --> 01:44:54,101
He's a fucking gym under pressure.
He just rides the horse drawn.

2385
01:44:54,610 --> 01:44:59,610
All right.
Was that what was his arm is hyper 

2386
01:44:59,610 --> 01:45:01,960
extended.
Vituro caught them in a beautiful arm 

2387
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:01,960
bar.
Perfect arm bar from the guard.

2388
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:03,250
Had a fully locked out.
It looked like it looked like it was.

2389
01:45:03,251 --> 01:45:03,770
Oh,
it was over,

2390
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:05,480
but didn't panic.
John just wouldn't,

2391
01:45:05,570 --> 01:45:10,570
wouldn't tap.
Let his elbow get fucked up and then 

2392
01:45:10,570 --> 01:45:10,850
went on to submit Vittorio.
It's crazy.

2393
01:45:11,650 --> 01:45:12,170
Well,
you know,

2394
01:45:12,171 --> 01:45:17,171
once,
once you're a fighter and you slap on 

2395
01:45:17,171 --> 01:45:19,001
something and you think you got to do,
you put all your effort in and then you 

2396
01:45:19,001 --> 01:45:20,870
lose it.
It does a little bit to some fighters to

2397
01:45:20,871 --> 01:45:22,030
their mental states,
you know,

2398
01:45:22,830 --> 01:45:25,580
they get depressed and then when you 
turn it up,

2399
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:30,960
you know it has the moment you want to 
start turning it up because then you 

2400
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:33,770
destroyed a fighter.
Then you can get actually to go for a 

2401
01:45:33,770 --> 01:45:33,770
submission.
So I think that's what happened there.

2402
01:45:33,770 --> 01:45:35,570
That was a unique fight too and that Jon
Jones dropped Vittori with the front leg

2403
01:45:35,571 --> 01:45:37,610
side kick to the body.
I was like,

2404
01:45:37,670 --> 01:45:41,030
that is a great technique for him 
because he's so long.

2405
01:45:41,350 --> 01:45:46,350
You know,
when you're seeing the way wonderboy 

2406
01:45:46,350 --> 01:45:47,980
uses it and some other folks use it and,
and sage Northcutt as a really good one 

2407
01:45:47,980 --> 01:45:47,980
as well.

2408
01:45:47,980 --> 01:45:49,340
But you think those will bleak.
I use.

2409
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:54,640
I have a feeling somebody is going to 
get hurt and they're going to take them 

2410
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:56,990
out because it looks so dangerous.
And especially the guy like Jones,

2411
01:45:56,991 --> 01:46:01,991
again,
because she got so much power on top of 

2412
01:46:01,991 --> 01:46:03,911
it,
if by any chance the guy just walks 

2413
01:46:03,911 --> 01:46:03,911
backwards in his leg is stretched and he
gets hit at that moment.

2414
01:46:03,911 --> 01:46:07,160
Silva women with silk because there was 
a fight.

2415
01:46:07,161 --> 01:46:12,161
I thought it would involve silverware.
I thought the same thing like this is 

2416
01:46:12,161 --> 01:46:15,791
gonna end in a serious knee injury.
He would do from lake side kicks to the 

2417
01:46:15,791 --> 01:46:16,310
knees.
He would just hit you.

2418
01:46:16,311 --> 01:46:19,460
I mean,
why not the right above the knee?

2419
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:24,500
Just hyperextends you're neil.
It's a weird thing because it's very 

2420
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:24,770
effectively.
So how come,

2421
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:27,050
how come you're allowed to round kick 
the outside of the knee?

2422
01:46:27,051 --> 01:46:28,290
Which everybody does.
You know,

2423
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:30,620
why you allowed to do that?
But you're not allowed to hyperextend.

2424
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:32,930
I mean,
if you're not there when it happens,

2425
01:46:32,990 --> 01:46:35,030
you don't get hit or you,
you know what I mean?

2426
01:46:35,031 --> 01:46:35,990
It's one of those things.
It's like,

2427
01:46:35,991 --> 01:46:39,350
it is a very effective technique.
Holly Holm uses it quite a bit,

2428
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:40,350
you know?
Uh,

2429
01:46:40,370 --> 01:46:42,260
she used it on Rhonda quite a bit in 
that fight.

2430
01:46:42,590 --> 01:46:44,450
The lower low kick,
I call it,

2431
01:46:44,451 --> 01:46:46,580
you know,
the little logo there under CAF.

2432
01:46:46,730 --> 01:46:47,660
And who,
who was it?

2433
01:46:47,661 --> 01:46:48,740
Who broke his,
uh,

2434
01:46:48,990 --> 01:46:50,370
people are again,

2435
01:46:50,550 --> 01:46:53,340
if I was a pretty recent like three 
months ago or something,

2436
01:46:53,341 --> 01:46:58,341
somebody broke his feeble because he got
kicked in the calf and they stopped the 

2437
01:46:58,341 --> 01:47:00,730
fight.
Now I'm thinking I'm the go to walk into

2438
01:47:00,740 --> 01:47:03,750
it.
Wasn't uc other organization,

2439
01:47:03,751 --> 01:47:04,320
Huh?
Yeah,

2440
01:47:04,321 --> 01:47:09,321
I mean it definitely happens.
What about knees to the head of a 

2441
01:47:09,321 --> 01:47:09,321
grounded opponent?
Joe?

2442
01:47:09,321 --> 01:47:10,290
Are you a fan?
Well,

2443
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:11,970
or blue thing could,
should be allowed.

2444
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:14,100
This is what I think.
I mean,

2445
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:16,500
I think that if someone is shooting for 
a takedown,

2446
01:47:16,501 --> 01:47:17,520
here's,
here's a question.

2447
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:22,760
So like say if a guy is in the process 
of a double leg and someone's knee 

2448
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:25,440
touches the ground,
the guy shooting for that double leg,

2449
01:47:25,441 --> 01:47:27,560
the knee touches the ground and as his 
knee touches the ground,

2450
01:47:27,561 --> 01:47:29,400
you're opponent is already launching 
into a knee,

2451
01:47:29,401 --> 01:47:34,401
a counter nate,
which is the perfect technique for that 

2452
01:47:34,401 --> 01:47:34,401
position,
right?

2453
01:47:34,401 --> 01:47:36,270
What happens there should be,
is that illegal?

2454
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:41,480
It should be.
If someone shoots a total power double 

2455
01:47:41,480 --> 01:47:42,950
on you.
And as they're sliding in their knees,

2456
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:45,600
hitting the ground and you catch them 
with a knee and put them out.

2457
01:47:45,601 --> 01:47:47,430
Is that a need or grounded opponent?
I mean,

2458
01:47:47,431 --> 01:47:48,110
how does that work?
Well,

2459
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:53,120
he slipped in.
I would say that's the same as I hit 

2460
01:47:53,120 --> 01:47:53,120
you,
but you turn your head at the moment.

2461
01:47:53,120 --> 01:47:53,610
I hit you.
I hit the back of your head.

2462
01:47:56,130 --> 01:47:58,100
Who are gaming the system?
Remember when the guys would.

2463
01:47:58,101 --> 01:48:00,660
They would just put that they have they.
Yeah,

2464
01:48:00,661 --> 01:48:01,980
that was just a little.
But,

2465
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:06,210
but it's also like there was a 
controversial fight really recently with

2466
01:48:06,211 --> 01:48:07,410
um,
uh,

2467
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:12,440
Oliveira's and a 10 means tim and Tim 
means and Mark Ratner,

2468
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:13,790
we,
I asked him when it was,

2469
01:48:14,790 --> 01:48:17,910
he's only on one point at one point 
being one knee.

2470
01:48:18,090 --> 01:48:20,080
I guess foot wasn't even on the ground 
like,

2471
01:48:20,081 --> 01:48:22,170
and his other foot was up.
Something like,

2472
01:48:22,171 --> 01:48:24,330
is that legal?
Like it was real confusing,

2473
01:48:24,331 --> 01:48:27,060
confusing run.
Mark Ratner said it should be legal.

2474
01:48:27,061 --> 01:48:27,630
And I'm like,
okay,

2475
01:48:27,631 --> 01:48:30,030
well it's one point is illegal.
And then John Macarthur said,

2476
01:48:30,031 --> 01:48:32,550
no.
He said it's not a point.

2477
01:48:32,551 --> 01:48:37,551
He said like that,
that expression that everybody uses 

2478
01:48:37,551 --> 01:48:40,130
three points more than three points,
like two hands and two feet rather than 

2479
01:48:40,130 --> 01:48:44,271
a hand.
It's illegal to hit person when they're 

2480
01:48:44,271 --> 01:48:46,401
down,
but he says it's the bottom of your 

2481
01:48:46,401 --> 01:48:46,401
feet.

2482
01:48:46,401 --> 01:48:46,950
Anytime it's not the bottom of your feet
are grounded opponent.

2483
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:50,360
So even if you have one knee on the 
ground and no feet like you're,

2484
01:48:50,370 --> 01:48:53,670
you're just bouncing and moving towards,
you're still a grounded opponent.

2485
01:48:54,770 --> 01:48:55,380
Yeah.
Yeah.

2486
01:48:55,381 --> 01:48:57,480
Which is weird.
That's weird.

2487
01:48:57,900 --> 01:49:00,030
I'm not sure if I agree with that.
No,

2488
01:49:00,031 --> 01:49:05,031
I don't either.
And and niche to the opponent on the 

2489
01:49:05,031 --> 01:49:05,310
grunt,
I always scraped her knee.

2490
01:49:05,370 --> 01:49:10,370
I think it's better then elbows and 
nowadays we see some knockouts with 

2491
01:49:10,831 --> 01:49:12,850
elbows and there's a lot of cuts and 
then you know,

2492
01:49:12,870 --> 01:49:14,350
and you don't have to with the knee and 
evil.

2493
01:49:14,550 --> 01:49:15,060
Well,
no.

2494
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:20,880
So that's why I said it's easy.
It's an easy defense once you know what 

2495
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:20,880
going to be coming there.
It's a bigger thing.

2496
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:21,960
You can just hold the thigh.
I mean,

2497
01:49:21,961 --> 01:49:24,160
but it's.
I prefer it over lotion.

2498
01:49:25,110 --> 01:49:29,700
Do you remember when Coleman used it and
pride from Randall Road South position?

2499
01:49:30,210 --> 01:49:31,370
Well,
Ya know,

2500
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:36,380
those are just,
I mean from sky high or just right to 

2501
01:49:36,380 --> 01:49:37,220
the.
I mean it's a restaurant.

2502
01:49:37,670 --> 01:49:40,440
One of the rest of the process moves 
because the wrestler,

2503
01:49:40,470 --> 01:49:41,190
they'll,
you know,

2504
01:49:41,191 --> 01:49:45,120
if you're trying to shoot on them and 
they sprawl and they're on top that they

2505
01:49:45,121 --> 01:49:47,280
have those needs right there.
Boom,

2506
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:48,160
boom.
It's

2507
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:51,640
a tremendous technique for wrestlers.
Remember Coleman?

2508
01:49:51,641 --> 01:49:56,500
That was the beginning.
The arms did it to Maurice.

2509
01:49:56,980 --> 01:49:59,200
Maurice Smith.
Mark Coleman.

2510
01:49:59,201 --> 01:50:04,201
Fight with when headbutts were allowed.
People forget that was nuts.

2511
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:07,000
But is it,
is it so nuts?

2512
01:50:07,180 --> 01:50:12,180
Why can't your head.
But I just like how come you can use 

2513
01:50:12,180 --> 01:50:14,581
your elbow but you can't head.
But why can't you art nine lymph node,

2514
01:50:15,550 --> 01:50:20,550
right?
I mean if you can cut someone with 

2515
01:50:20,550 --> 01:50:20,550
elbows,
right?

2516
01:50:20,550 --> 01:50:20,550
You're slashing across their face with 
elbows.

2517
01:50:20,550 --> 01:50:22,810
Why can't you have.
But because of the concussion thing,

2518
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:24,130
I don't know,
but it's up to you.

2519
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:29,460
Right?
I mean it seems like we were talking 

2520
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:29,460
about the art of actual fighting.
Sure.

2521
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:31,810
We know that a headbutt is a real 
martial arts technique.

2522
01:50:31,811 --> 01:50:32,630
Yep.
You know,

2523
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:37,680
I know why that is.
And it was one of the reasons I would 

2524
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:37,680
have bought somebody if there was a lot 
of audience,

2525
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:39,220
uh,
when I was fighting at a club,

2526
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:44,320
if I had to fight,
almost never fought for what you do 

2527
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:44,320
because I just talked my way out though.

2528
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:45,250
I would tell the people that you just 
nothing going on.

2529
01:50:45,251 --> 01:50:50,251
But if I did,
I used it on purpose headbutts because 

2530
01:50:50,251 --> 01:50:53,911
they look really insane and I will make 
sure that older people were watching 

2531
01:50:53,911 --> 01:50:54,730
that they would understand that,
you know,

2532
01:50:54,910 --> 01:50:57,690
we can't accept that kind of behavior 
that have bought,

2533
01:50:58,240 --> 01:50:59,920
that will freak people out,
you know?

2534
01:50:59,921 --> 01:51:02,260
And I truly believe that's it's for,
you know,

2535
01:51:02,261 --> 01:51:04,360
for the sport to make the sport more 
attractive.

2536
01:51:04,630 --> 01:51:08,020
Take the hell wants a normal person,
watches the fight,

2537
01:51:08,021 --> 01:51:11,020
like a comas thought,
headbutting somebody into oblivion,

2538
01:51:11,320 --> 01:51:12,130
you know,
they're going to go,

2539
01:51:12,220 --> 01:51:15,210
is this a sport?
It looks,

2540
01:51:15,530 --> 01:51:17,170
it looks really bad.
It looks terrible.

2541
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:22,440
So to soccer kid.
So I was going to say ground and pound 

2542
01:51:22,440 --> 01:51:26,530
for that matter.
A lot of boxes and people had a hard 

2543
01:51:26,530 --> 01:51:26,980
time with people being on the ground and
getting hammered.

2544
01:51:26,980 --> 01:51:28,980
Interested in the big problem.
Once you're aware,

2545
01:51:28,990 --> 01:51:31,720
tell you remember if they won the 
championship.

2546
01:51:32,140 --> 01:51:33,250
That was scary.
I mean,

2547
01:51:33,251 --> 01:51:36,520
I don't know why the referee didn't stop
the why he let him kick.

2548
01:51:37,120 --> 01:51:42,120
I mean it was obvious he was.
He was an a la La land use in Lala land 

2549
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:42,940
and he got hit with the horrible soccer 
kick in.

2550
01:51:42,941 --> 01:51:46,270
His whole body went flying.
He was just dead out cold.

2551
01:51:46,290 --> 01:51:47,740
Could have killed him.
Well,

2552
01:51:47,741 --> 01:51:52,741
and you know Rogers and a guy that 
should have been a superstar man cover 

2553
01:51:52,741 --> 01:51:54,550
of sports.
There's a curse.

2554
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:57,490
The curse,
the curse.

2555
01:51:57,491 --> 01:51:59,250
He fell right into it and he's on the 
cover.

2556
01:51:59,340 --> 01:52:04,340
Curse somebody thing.
But athletes so mad and curse,

2557
01:52:08,820 --> 01:52:12,640
the curse type thing.
But that's also what they said about the

2558
01:52:12,641 --> 01:52:16,080
UFC game.
Cop gets on it.

2559
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:23,080
It is weird,
crazy urban legend.

2560
01:52:24,371 --> 01:52:29,371
The states that individuals and teams 
who appeared on the cover of sports 

2561
01:52:29,371 --> 01:52:29,371
illustrated magazine will subsequently 
be jinx.

2562
01:52:29,740 --> 01:52:32,120
Well,
it does it say anything in terms of what

2563
01:52:32,140 --> 01:52:35,420
actual a result.
How many pots.

2564
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:40,440
Look,
there's touch folks.

2565
01:52:42,820 --> 01:52:44,890
I couldn't even read this list.
This list is fucking.

2566
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:45,960
It's

2567
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:50,560
like everybody would ever to.
You don't want to be on it.

2568
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:54,370
I believe we didn't think.
Was that before the fight?

2569
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:56,840
Before the fight.
Conor mcgregor.

2570
01:52:56,841 --> 01:52:58,610
March fifth,
2016.

2571
01:52:59,060 --> 01:53:01,060
Holy Shit.
Go West side.

2572
01:53:01,090 --> 01:53:06,090
Jake's.
He was scheduled to fight how us on 

2573
01:53:06,090 --> 01:53:08,300
Joseph.
Then dos Anjos fell apart with a broken 

2574
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:11,111
foot.
Dos Anjos is going up to me to a 

2575
01:53:11,111 --> 01:53:11,111
welterweight.
That's interesting.

2576
01:53:11,111 --> 01:53:13,270
Very interesting.
I love how he,

2577
01:53:13,450 --> 01:53:15,960
how he feels good without uh,
cutting so much weight.

2578
01:53:15,961 --> 01:53:19,130
He's a big fella.
Everybody.

2579
01:53:19,131 --> 01:53:21,530
Everybody when they fight they fight so 
much better.

2580
01:53:22,060 --> 01:53:24,260
But then whoever.
Does everyone do that?

2581
01:53:24,261 --> 01:53:25,470
I think yeah.
For,

2582
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:29,090
for a lot of reasons.
You should fight closer to a solution.

2583
01:53:29,091 --> 01:53:32,300
Do you think there's a way that they can
make guys way their natural weight?

2584
01:53:32,301 --> 01:53:35,690
Like test them the same way they test 
for like drugs?

2585
01:53:35,900 --> 01:53:37,820
Test them for hydration.
Like show up.

2586
01:53:37,820 --> 01:53:42,820
Hey Maura,
we're going to just put you on a scale 

2587
01:53:42,820 --> 01:53:42,820
today and find out what you actually 
will moral you.

2588
01:53:42,820 --> 01:53:43,520
Fight 1:55.
You weigh one 86.

2589
01:53:43,521 --> 01:53:46,120
What the fuck's going on dude?
Yeah man.

2590
01:53:46,490 --> 01:53:51,490
Get in shape.
Get in shape and tell us when you're 

2591
01:53:51,490 --> 01:53:53,771
ready and what you actually weigh.
And so then when you find out that the 

2592
01:53:53,771 --> 01:53:54,450
guys in shape and you're actually,
you go your,

2593
01:53:54,460 --> 01:53:55,430
your,
your shape,

2594
01:53:55,431 --> 01:53:56,240
you're in,
you're ready.

2595
01:53:56,241 --> 01:53:56,840
Okay?
Okay,

2596
01:53:56,841 --> 01:53:59,540
well it says here you weigh one 75.
There you go.

2597
01:53:59,541 --> 01:54:04,541
Okay,
now we're going to check your hydration 

2598
01:54:04,541 --> 01:54:04,541
levels.
Oh,

2599
01:54:04,541 --> 01:54:04,541
well you're dehydrated though.
Okay.

2600
01:54:04,541 --> 01:54:06,020
We're going to get you to the normal 
hydration level.

2601
01:54:06,021 --> 01:54:07,400
This is argued.
Now you're healthy.

2602
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:08,990
You're one 79.
Okay?

2603
01:54:08,991 --> 01:54:11,480
This is what you weigh.
One hundred 80 pound fighter.

2604
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:16,500
Yup.
And just decide whether or not you want 

2605
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:16,500
to fight.
And if you do,

2606
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:16,760
this is what you fight at.

2607
01:54:16,820 --> 01:54:19,310
Or if you want to weigh less,
you got to have to lose some weight,

2608
01:54:19,630 --> 01:54:22,820
but you can prove that you actually way 
that you know,

2609
01:54:22,821 --> 01:54:25,640
like lose all the body fat.
Get yourself to a good position.

2610
01:54:25,670 --> 01:54:26,210
You know?
Okay,

2611
01:54:26,211 --> 01:54:27,800
so what are you at now?
You're at will?

2612
01:54:27,801 --> 01:54:30,740
I've got myself down to one 70 way.
I'm okay.

2613
01:54:30,760 --> 01:54:32,570
Looks like you're actually one 70 and 
look,

2614
01:54:32,571 --> 01:54:34,160
check your hydration.
Your healthy.

2615
01:54:34,190 --> 01:54:35,480
Okay.
So this is your real weight.

2616
01:54:35,690 --> 01:54:37,160
You fight one 70.
Perfect.

2617
01:54:37,220 --> 01:54:40,760
I mean how many guys?
My weight class of course,

2618
01:54:42,540 --> 01:54:47,540
and that's unfortunate,
but for the goiter was established for 

2619
01:54:47,540 --> 01:54:52,241
the greater good.
I like that you said it already at the 

2620
01:54:52,241 --> 01:54:52,241
beginning of the old ways.
They blame other people.

2621
01:54:52,241 --> 01:54:53,270
Fighters,
you know,

2622
01:54:53,271 --> 01:54:58,271
and if there's nobody to blame,
they blame the fact that their opponent 

2623
01:54:58,271 --> 01:54:59,750
was cutting more weight so he was 
stronger in the fight.

2624
01:54:59,780 --> 01:55:00,860
That's why I lost.
No,

2625
01:55:00,861 --> 01:55:04,430
you lost because you lost.
You didn't lose because she weighed five

2626
01:55:04,431 --> 01:55:05,030
pounds.
Sex.

2627
01:55:05,031 --> 01:55:06,260
I look at the old days,
man,

2628
01:55:06,261 --> 01:55:08,370
let's forget what Frankie.
He,

2629
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:10,250
everybody will.
You just won 55.

2630
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:12,900
18.
He didn't cut a goddamn out one and he's

2631
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:14,320
beating everybody.
But that's,

2632
01:55:14,321 --> 01:55:15,200
that's,
that's the problem.

2633
01:55:15,201 --> 01:55:18,320
And they got and they shocked for 
focusing on it and at least because they

2634
01:55:18,321 --> 01:55:23,321
can give it a reason.
And then let's hope that the main 

2635
01:55:23,321 --> 01:55:25,540
events,
we've lost shows and we will lose sight.

2636
01:55:25,710 --> 01:55:27,590
Chris Justino,
I mean,

2637
01:55:29,030 --> 01:55:33,710
what is her weight?
What is the most healthiest?

2638
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:36,750
She's think that's true.
That's true.

2639
01:55:36,950 --> 01:55:38,150
So Bonnie,
she's bigger than that.

2640
01:55:38,450 --> 01:55:40,850
I agree with you.
I don't think if she,

2641
01:55:40,851 --> 01:55:45,851
if it's that much of a struggle,
she's almost done outside of to make 

2642
01:55:45,851 --> 01:55:45,900
1:40
1:45

2643
01:55:45,901 --> 01:55:48,600
is a bruised street with 1:50
5:55

2644
01:55:48,601 --> 01:55:50,790
is a real weight class.
There you go.

2645
01:55:50,791 --> 01:55:52,380
So,
well maybe it's not for her,

2646
01:55:52,470 --> 01:55:54,450
but you know,
I'm hearing that she's even heavier than

2647
01:55:54,451 --> 01:55:58,250
one 75.
She's way over one 80 shift.

2648
01:55:59,400 --> 01:55:59,730
Gabby.

2649
01:56:01,850 --> 01:56:03,690
Gabby slows down their friends.
Oh yeah,

2650
01:56:03,700 --> 01:56:04,400
yeah,
yeah.

2651
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:09,500
I mean I've,
I wish there were more weight classes 

2652
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:09,500
for men and for women.
You know,

2653
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:10,620
I wish there was a ton of weight classes
in boxing.

2654
01:56:11,010 --> 01:56:12,510
I think.
Yeah.

2655
01:56:12,511 --> 01:56:17,511
The one thing that boxing has the people
don't like is that they have so many 

2656
01:56:17,511 --> 01:56:17,580
champions.
You have too many weight classes,

2657
01:56:17,581 --> 01:56:19,730
but that's how you make things fair.
You're right,

2658
01:56:19,990 --> 01:56:22,680
you've got like you can't have a one 85 
and then a two.

2659
01:56:22,681 --> 01:56:24,750
Oh five.
That jump is huge.

2660
01:56:24,980 --> 01:56:27,360
Twenty five to 65,
20 stakes,

2661
01:56:27,361 --> 01:56:31,070
20 pounds.
Take Twenty one ounce or 16 ounce t bone

2662
01:56:31,071 --> 01:56:34,260
steak and stack them up and imagine that
someone has that advantage over you.

2663
01:56:35,110 --> 01:56:39,950
If it's in his belly,
it's okay to 35 week class,

2664
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:41,220
we need that.
I think you're right.

2665
01:56:41,221 --> 01:56:44,970
Or 2:25,
25 maybe at 2:45

2666
01:56:44,971 --> 01:56:46,500
and then unlimited.
You know,

2667
01:56:46,501 --> 01:56:51,501
who knows,
but I think that having heavyweight 

2668
01:56:51,501 --> 01:56:51,930
where there's a weightless,
you can't weigh more than two 65.

2669
01:56:51,930 --> 01:56:54,140
That seems crazy because they had a been
what?

2670
01:56:54,170 --> 01:56:59,170
80 a day of the fight will look and then
you're struggling.

2671
01:57:00,950 --> 01:57:02,700
You can,
you can go to two.

2672
01:57:02,701 --> 01:57:07,701
Oh five to 20 and you have a really hard
gut and then you face a guy who's do 85.

2673
01:57:08,431 --> 01:57:10,980
Although the early morning thing I guess
has been successful right?

2674
01:57:10,981 --> 01:57:13,830
The day of the.
Now it's successful.

2675
01:57:13,831 --> 01:57:18,510
Radically unsuccessful.
There's been 17 different people missing

2676
01:57:18,590 --> 01:57:23,590
weight like one or two in the same time.
So then what's this?

2677
01:57:24,750 --> 01:57:26,910
Why is that then just because they want 
to get the edge,

2678
01:57:26,911 --> 01:57:27,960
the safety,
safety,

2679
01:57:27,961 --> 01:57:30,030
it gives people more time to rehydrate 
themselves,

2680
01:57:30,031 --> 01:57:32,600
but the problem is it gives them less 
time to lose the weight.

2681
01:57:32,601 --> 01:57:37,601
Right?
So if you're starting off early in the 

2682
01:57:37,601 --> 01:57:37,601
morning,
like if you're,

2683
01:57:37,601 --> 01:57:37,920
if your weigh ins or at 4:00
and you know you're not going to eat all

2684
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:42,920
day,
you're going to lose weight all 

2685
01:57:42,920 --> 01:57:42,920
throughout the day,
but if you're way answered at 8:00

2686
01:57:42,920 --> 01:57:43,960
in the morning when you're getting up,
you're going to lose all that weight.

2687
01:57:44,370 --> 01:57:45,240
You know,
you might not,

2688
01:57:45,330 --> 01:57:48,780
you might not lose enough weight.
So people were miscalculating including.

2689
01:57:49,150 --> 01:57:54,150
There's definitely a lot.
There's definitely an issue with people 

2690
01:57:54,150 --> 01:57:57,111
cutting too much weight.
There's definitely an issue with people 

2691
01:57:57,111 --> 01:57:58,350
doing it unhealthy Sunday be punished or
penalized even more though,

2692
01:57:58,351 --> 01:58:02,690
like I just recently heard Gospel 30 
percent of his wealth and that's what,

2693
01:58:02,691 --> 01:58:03,470
okay,
that,

2694
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:05,460
that's fine.
But even Calvin Gospel when they admit,

2695
01:58:05,640 --> 01:58:10,640
yeah,
I haven't really been looking after my 

2696
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:10,640
died.
Right.

2697
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:10,640
You're a professional athlete signed to 
the.

2698
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:13,350
The biggest organization in the world 
did.

2699
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:18,360
Shouldn't that be part of the contract 
that in if you're fighting for us that 

2700
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:19,490
you have to maintain,
you almost have those.

2701
01:58:19,630 --> 01:58:24,120
I instead of even a random drug tests,
random random way to obviously they made

2702
01:58:24,121 --> 01:58:25,710
calvin go up to one 85.
Yes.

2703
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:30,720
Next fight.
And what's crazy is he looked fucking 

2704
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:34,470
insane and Tim Kennedy blew his entire,
was trying to take him down and beat him

2705
01:58:34,471 --> 01:58:35,340
up.
And the earlier,

2706
01:58:35,341 --> 01:58:36,340
the first round,
I mean,

2707
01:58:36,341 --> 01:58:37,050
he,
he,

2708
01:58:37,051 --> 01:58:39,720
he showed his size advantage,
his strength advantage.

2709
01:58:39,721 --> 01:58:41,500
He's a massive,
uh,

2710
01:58:41,540 --> 01:58:42,000
like he's

2711
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:45,070
a massive powerhouse when it comes to 
his ground and pound his Jujitsu.

2712
01:58:45,340 --> 01:58:48,370
But Calvin just stayed the course,
the defense.

2713
01:58:48,371 --> 01:58:49,900
And then eventually when he got on his 
feet,

2714
01:58:49,901 --> 01:58:52,800
man way to swift and it's,
how many times does he know?

2715
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:57,880
Three just missed a bunch of times he 
missed against Tyron Woodley and tyron 

2716
01:58:57,880 --> 01:58:58,600
and beat him.
And tyrone as a gentleman,

2717
01:58:58,601 --> 01:59:00,080
decided yes,
even take his money.

2718
01:59:00,090 --> 01:59:04,960
Remember the which is a very fucking 
ethical and moral move by the champ.

2719
01:59:04,990 --> 01:59:07,240
Now the current champ.
So he lost that.

2720
01:59:07,270 --> 01:59:10,510
And I mean there was more than one fight
in the past for that.

2721
01:59:10,511 --> 01:59:12,430
But you wouldn't,
you say.

2722
01:59:12,431 --> 01:59:13,240
Okay.
Again,

2723
01:59:13,470 --> 01:59:16,690
not because he's a great fighter,
like you're saying.

2724
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:17,710
Very good.
One 85.

2725
01:59:17,711 --> 01:59:18,490
So let's hope.
Okay.

2726
01:59:18,491 --> 01:59:20,120
Stays.
But if Mrs Wade,

2727
01:59:20,950 --> 01:59:22,660
you should take a year.
You can,

2728
01:59:23,850 --> 01:59:28,850
you know,
put the fear in them and then they 

2729
01:59:28,850 --> 01:59:28,850
really going to do.

2730
01:59:28,850 --> 01:59:30,790
I think Calvin should fight at 85.
I think he could when he could.

2731
01:59:30,791 --> 01:59:35,791
When it 70.
I think he can make 70 but he doesn't 

2732
01:59:35,791 --> 01:59:35,791
always make sense or you're right one.
Yeah,

2733
01:59:35,791 --> 01:59:40,730
I mean unless he wants to lose a ton of 
body fat and then try fighting at one 

2734
01:59:40,730 --> 01:59:40,730
70,
you know,

2735
01:59:40,730 --> 01:59:43,530
really clean his diet up.
Really go down the bricks.

2736
01:59:44,170 --> 01:59:46,090
Donnie Henderson does not seem like the 
same person.

2737
01:59:46,120 --> 01:59:51,120
Oh what it.
Because of Thompson wrecking them the 

2738
01:59:51,120 --> 01:59:54,391
way.
But I agree because I heard you say as 

2739
01:59:54,391 --> 01:59:54,391
well,
even though like physically did not look

2740
01:59:54,391 --> 01:59:54,960
physically.
No,

2741
01:59:55,030 --> 01:59:58,750
he doesn't look like he works as hard.
It doesn't look like he is as motivated.

2742
01:59:58,751 --> 02:00:02,410
He doesn't look as hungry.
His vaunted knockout power is gone.

2743
02:00:02,411 --> 02:00:03,130
Gone,
gone.

2744
02:00:03,210 --> 02:00:03,900
Great.
Weird,

2745
02:00:05,020 --> 02:00:06,070
it's weird.
Yeah,

2746
02:00:06,130 --> 02:00:11,130
I,
I wanted him and I said a long time ago 

2747
02:00:11,130 --> 02:00:13,291
if I was just coaching with his tie his 
left hand through his body and it put 

2748
02:00:13,291 --> 02:00:13,291
them after every workout.

2749
02:00:13,291 --> 02:00:15,490
You go three or four rounds on the back,
you know,

2750
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:20,520
just using your right hand Kale.
Imagine if he developed a right hand on 

2751
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:23,881
top of that.
I mean because it was 90 percent was 

2752
02:00:23,881 --> 02:00:23,881
left,
you know,

2753
02:00:23,881 --> 02:00:25,480
you would,
that you open a whole new door,

2754
02:00:25,481 --> 02:00:26,280
you know,
you know,

2755
02:00:26,310 --> 02:00:31,310
and it's an unfair to question someone 
whether or not they tested positive for 

2756
02:00:31,310 --> 02:00:32,380
anything.
If they took anything,

2757
02:00:32,381 --> 02:00:37,381
if you haven't tested positive.
So he never tested positive for 

2758
02:00:37,381 --> 02:00:40,141
anything.
So you can't look at it that I don't 

2759
02:00:40,141 --> 02:00:41,461
think he did.
Did he know maybe a diuretic or 

2760
02:00:41,461 --> 02:00:41,461
something.
Maybe.

2761
02:00:41,461 --> 02:00:43,600
Maybe find out if Johnny Hendricks ever 
tested positive for something.

2762
02:00:43,630 --> 02:00:45,130
I don't think he did.
So you know,

2763
02:00:45,131 --> 02:00:50,131
there's a lot of people throwing 
accusations about him and George St 

2764
02:00:50,131 --> 02:00:52,890
Pierre was.
But you know what it costs will be one 

2765
02:00:52,890 --> 02:00:52,890
of the things he said about his last 
fight,

2766
02:00:52,890 --> 02:00:56,110
he said he worked out four times a week,
week one time,

2767
02:00:56,111 --> 02:00:56,860
four times a week.

2768
02:00:56,870 --> 02:00:59,110
He's like,
he just was not focused on that fight.

2769
02:00:59,710 --> 02:01:01,060
If that's the case,
you've got to get.

2770
02:01:01,190 --> 02:01:06,190
That's why he looks like that has 
nothing to do with Usada or anything 

2771
02:01:06,190 --> 02:01:06,190
else.
He just doesn't have the hunger.

2772
02:01:06,190 --> 02:01:06,920
And that's it.
And that's where you,

2773
02:01:07,030 --> 02:01:11,000
you put yourself at great risk,
but also mentally going into the fight.

2774
02:01:11,001 --> 02:01:14,770
If you know that another guy trained 10 
times a week and you're trained for what

2775
02:01:14,771 --> 02:01:19,771
are you going to do it for?
It's just weird that his power went 

2776
02:01:19,771 --> 02:01:20,400
away.
I mean he used to make ice crumble.

2777
02:01:20,570 --> 02:01:23,200
He used to let me know when he hit John 
Fitch and went flying,

2778
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:25,510
Martin Kampmann flying,
went flying.

2779
02:01:25,940 --> 02:01:28,550
It was like he had magic in his hands 
and then all of a sudden it stopped.

2780
02:01:29,420 --> 02:01:34,420
So what the fuck really just ruined him.
Yeah,

2781
02:01:37,290 --> 02:01:38,250
he.
Yeah.

2782
02:01:38,470 --> 02:01:43,470
And you fucked him up and he fucked him 
up with like using that front leg side 

2783
02:01:43,470 --> 02:01:43,470
kick.

2784
02:01:43,470 --> 02:01:47,680
And then the front leg round kiss would 
he hit a bad one to the body and then 

2785
02:01:47,680 --> 02:01:48,370
johnny leg nods his head like you got 
me.

2786
02:01:48,490 --> 02:01:50,480
And then slap the same one right up to 
the face.

2787
02:01:51,030 --> 02:01:53,210
And that's the thing with water boy,
he makes it.

2788
02:01:53,410 --> 02:01:54,470
Oh yeah.
Perfectly.

2789
02:01:54,471 --> 02:01:57,290
And then it suddenly a hook a get a 
question mark and it's every time it's a

2790
02:01:57,291 --> 02:01:59,270
different cake,
you don't know what's going to come.

2791
02:01:59,271 --> 02:02:02,660
Mr Berger Talk Shit about him.
All the spinning kicks.

2792
02:02:02,661 --> 02:02:03,820
It's a waste of energy.
So.

2793
02:02:03,890 --> 02:02:04,580
Oh,
for real.

2794
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:07,290
This shit out.
I don't think it's a coincidence city.

2795
02:02:07,300 --> 02:02:09,290
We'll kicked ellenberger in the head 
twice.

2796
02:02:10,280 --> 02:02:11,510
Here's your waste of time,
dude.

2797
02:02:11,990 --> 02:02:12,680
Yeah,
it's not,

2798
02:02:12,770 --> 02:02:15,140
it's not a waste.
It's some fucking super good at this.

2799
02:02:15,260 --> 02:02:19,070
But Greg King,
conor Mcgregor too,

2800
02:02:19,071 --> 02:02:20,490
right?
He's using a lot more.

2801
02:02:21,660 --> 02:02:26,660
But the kitchen like him during the more
to measure the whole the opponent at bay

2802
02:02:27,351 --> 02:02:29,060
and then suddenly his his hand.

2803
02:02:29,060 --> 02:02:34,060
So the left turn lane.
The Guy Man,

2804
02:02:35,451 --> 02:02:39,290
he's one of my favorite guys to watch.
Also be outside of fighting.

2805
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:45,120
Get the way he talks.
He never has the same like with me with 

2806
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:45,140
interviews where people ask,
you know about your life,

2807
02:02:45,141 --> 02:02:46,340
how it started.
Well,

2808
02:02:46,341 --> 02:02:46,760
it,
it's,

2809
02:02:46,820 --> 02:02:48,710
it's the same story over and over again.
Well,

2810
02:02:48,711 --> 02:02:50,480
he can.
He can make it every time.

2811
02:02:50,870 --> 02:02:53,270
He's one of those guys that constantly 
changes.

2812
02:02:53,300 --> 02:02:55,630
Smart businessman.
Oh,

2813
02:02:55,860 --> 02:02:56,930
smart.
Smart is.

2814
02:02:57,020 --> 02:02:59,870
He's the best shit talker in the history
of combat sports.

2815
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:05,440
Before that it was chill son into 
Mohammed Ali and now it's conor 

2816
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:07,360
mcgregor.
He just knows how to fucking say it.

2817
02:03:08,060 --> 02:03:09,770
Jeremy Stevens starts talking to him.
He goes,

2818
02:03:10,980 --> 02:03:15,020
the guy just destroyed them with one 
sentence.

2819
02:03:15,460 --> 02:03:15,920
I mean,
it's,

2820
02:03:15,980 --> 02:03:17,900
he's,
he finds the perfect shit.

2821
02:03:17,901 --> 02:03:19,510
You say.
The way he looked back.

2822
02:03:22,290 --> 02:03:27,290
It's hilarious when he went in there and
dilated Eddie Alvarez like that.

2823
02:03:28,730 --> 02:03:31,160
You just gotta go,
fuck man.

2824
02:03:31,590 --> 02:03:35,750
He's any of that style of sliding out 
and sliding in.

2825
02:03:35,751 --> 02:03:40,751
It's a very unusual,
almost a karate based style with like 

2826
02:03:40,751 --> 02:03:42,860
sitting down on vicious punches on the 
end of it,

2827
02:03:42,861 --> 02:03:47,861
you know,
but you don't hit stamps and because 

2828
02:03:47,861 --> 02:03:47,861
she's a soccer ball.
But I,

2829
02:03:47,861 --> 02:03:47,861
I thought,
you know what,

2830
02:03:47,861 --> 02:03:50,060
with the.
Although if I was all those coach a year

2831
02:03:50,060 --> 02:03:55,060
ago already,
I would have said when we go to trey 

2832
02:03:55,060 --> 02:03:58,200
South Pole and you because there's no 
way he can block those low kicks if 

2833
02:03:58,200 --> 02:03:58,670
left,
there's no way he can block them because

2834
02:03:58,671 --> 02:04:02,250
his stance is too white and his knees 
are pointing to the again,

2835
02:04:02,350 --> 02:04:07,350
100 percent.
The whole game changes the whole game 

2836
02:04:07,350 --> 02:04:08,310
and his left low kick by the way.
Look.

2837
02:04:08,330 --> 02:04:12,350
Although could kick the fuck out of you 
with either low or right.

2838
02:04:13,130 --> 02:04:14,560
Wow Man.
Yeah.

2839
02:04:14,930 --> 02:04:15,310
Yeah.
He,

2840
02:04:15,380 --> 02:04:18,310
he,
he made me think of for Ramon dekkers,

2841
02:04:18,360 --> 02:04:20,090
Ya know,
that explosive.

2842
02:04:20,180 --> 02:04:21,310
Oh Man.
His law will.

2843
02:04:21,320 --> 02:04:24,780
They call the Duchy left to the body and
then right leg kicked behind it.

2844
02:04:26,330 --> 02:04:27,400
Chad Mendez.
I was like,

2845
02:04:27,450 --> 02:04:30,380
whoa.
Though he throws it man.

2846
02:04:30,590 --> 02:04:34,640
I think although and Max Holloway's have
very interesting fight that fight.

2847
02:04:35,580 --> 02:04:37,620
So it has to.
It has happen.

2848
02:04:37,621 --> 02:04:42,621
I keep hearing all this crazy shit like 
Aldo my go up and fight a bead for the 

2849
02:04:42,621 --> 02:04:43,560
interim title and I'm like,
God damn it.

2850
02:04:43,561 --> 02:04:47,700
You got to have a fight at 12.
There we go again.

2851
02:04:47,701 --> 02:04:49,320
Right.
The money you weight fights,

2852
02:04:49,330 --> 02:04:54,330
everyone already even talked about 
mcwane instead of staying in their way 

2853
02:04:55,531 --> 02:05:00,030
instead of defending the title they own.
I mean it's obviously not as big a fight

2854
02:05:00,031 --> 02:05:01,980
is him fighting Nijmegen madoff in 
Russia.

2855
02:05:02,090 --> 02:05:07,090
Right.
And especially if they fight for a 55 

2856
02:05:07,090 --> 02:05:10,251
pound title,
they've never gone out fights in Russia 

2857
02:05:10,251 --> 02:05:10,251
and they might have to fucking build a 
new soccer stadium.

2858
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:14,610
I don't think people understand.
Anytime I post something on Instagram,

2859
02:05:14,611 --> 02:05:19,611
I get 150 fucking Russian dudes who 
write Habib time and then they just 

2860
02:05:19,611 --> 02:05:20,370
pulled her beep time with the credit 
side.

2861
02:05:20,510 --> 02:05:23,170
My fucking credits are overrun with 
people that say aura,

2862
02:05:23,250 --> 02:05:24,180
not credits,
comments.

2863
02:05:24,670 --> 02:05:26,860
Overrun with people say Habib time,
Habib time.

2864
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:29,940
Fucking just for safety.
When they're building that thing,

2865
02:05:29,941 --> 02:05:34,941
make an underground tunnel for when he 
loses his straight to the airport.

2866
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:41,320
Like if you fight conor.
You know what's interesting about the 

2867
02:05:41,320 --> 02:05:41,320
conor fight,
man,

2868
02:05:41,320 --> 02:05:41,340
lack Habib time.
Habib time.

2869
02:05:41,341 --> 02:05:41,880
See?
Oh yeah,

2870
02:05:41,881 --> 02:05:43,110
yeah.
He's not fucking around.

2871
02:05:43,111 --> 02:05:44,970
It's all true.
But like,

2872
02:05:44,971 --> 02:05:46,620
um,
if he fights connor,

2873
02:05:46,770 --> 02:05:51,770
we,
Michael Johnson cracked him and rocked 

2874
02:05:51,770 --> 02:05:51,770
him.
I went,

2875
02:05:51,770 --> 02:05:54,650
oh boy,
he did get angry and he beat the fuck 

2876
02:05:54,650 --> 02:05:56,350
out of them,
but the point is he got hurt,

2877
02:05:56,351 --> 02:05:58,650
he got hurt,
and if connor catches you like that,

2878
02:05:58,680 --> 02:06:00,450
you might be fucking Donesville.

2879
02:06:00,860 --> 02:06:04,110
He might drop some hammers on you and 
that might be the same thing.

2880
02:06:04,170 --> 02:06:09,170
Right.
The we've seen caught her as well at 

2881
02:06:09,170 --> 02:06:11,520
times.
It's just the bet habibs defense.

2882
02:06:11,820 --> 02:06:15,210
We saw conor get rocked against nate and
you wind up losing that fight.

2883
02:06:15,211 --> 02:06:19,920
Shortly thereafter Habib got rocked and 
it's Michael Johnson came back stronger.

2884
02:06:19,940 --> 02:06:21,090
Yeah,
dominated him.

2885
02:06:21,300 --> 02:06:22,830
So it was the only time.
I mean,

2886
02:06:22,831 --> 02:06:24,970
it's when you see a guy with his 
dominant is a Habib,

2887
02:06:25,020 --> 02:06:26,700
you start looking for weaknesses in his 
arm.

2888
02:06:26,701 --> 02:06:28,440
It's the only time we've seen any 
weakness at all.

2889
02:06:28,670 --> 02:06:29,300
But uh,
Greg,

2890
02:06:29,420 --> 02:06:31,600
in his defense,
he was getting tired already there.

2891
02:06:33,990 --> 02:06:34,580
Yup.
Yup,

2892
02:06:34,690 --> 02:06:35,090
Yup,
sure.

2893
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:36,240
Would that be.
Doesn't get tired.

2894
02:06:36,241 --> 02:06:41,241
Did you see that funny video to habit to
narrating guy who's constantly dropping 

2895
02:06:41,241 --> 02:06:45,141
f bombs leftover?
I tell a story about how bp they always 

2896
02:06:45,141 --> 02:06:46,200
training and where you coach from,
no one was six years old.

2897
02:06:46,201 --> 02:06:50,100
He was already wrestling with fricking 
bears and it's really funny.

2898
02:06:50,101 --> 02:06:52,230
It's.
It's on here right now somewhere.

2899
02:06:52,350 --> 02:06:55,680
Do you know what the name of the show?
A hobby.

2900
02:06:56,010 --> 02:07:01,010
A Hobby Promo.
Just put that on trusting man of the 

2901
02:07:01,561 --> 02:07:06,561
world title.
It's lately made so it will pop up and 

2902
02:07:06,561 --> 02:07:06,900
pop.
I guess it's really funny.

2903
02:07:07,070 --> 02:07:09,150
Nice.
And you see them wrestling a bear.

2904
02:07:09,300 --> 02:07:14,300
A bear when he was six years old and 
then he starts talking about his father 

2905
02:07:14,300 --> 02:07:15,030
who was already a really.
But that's the other thing.

2906
02:07:15,031 --> 02:07:17,940
Judo Guy MMA and sample reports.
The memes.

2907
02:07:17,941 --> 02:07:21,490
The use of social media get so cool man.
Well the.

2908
02:07:22,110 --> 02:07:27,110
Unless you Ronda Rousey's Nunez fight or
should come in so many fucking people.

2909
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,520
You know what those mean?
What do you,

2910
02:07:32,550 --> 02:07:34,410
what do you think she's coming back?
No,

2911
02:07:34,411 --> 02:07:35,700
I don't think she.
I mean

2912
02:07:36,090 --> 02:07:39,100
I don't think.
I don't think if she does,

2913
02:07:39,340 --> 02:07:42,910
she should come back in a calculated 
manner.

2914
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:46,060
Like don't just rush in and fight for 
the title like she did.

2915
02:07:46,120 --> 02:07:48,130
I think that's crazy.
Taking a year off,

2916
02:07:48,131 --> 02:07:49,570
getting head kick,
knocked out,

2917
02:07:49,990 --> 02:07:51,130
you know?
Where's your head out?

2918
02:07:51,620 --> 02:07:56,620
And was she 100 percent committed to 
this as far as like training for the 

2919
02:07:56,620 --> 02:07:59,170
entire time off?
Or did she just get in really good shape

2920
02:07:59,171 --> 02:08:01,900
over the last few months and had she 
been training at all before then?

2921
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:06,920
I mean,
you'd have to ask her and answer all 

2922
02:08:06,920 --> 02:08:06,920
those questions,
but if she doesn't want to be fighting,

2923
02:08:07,120 --> 02:08:08,200
she shouldn't be fighting,

2924
02:08:08,660 --> 02:08:13,660
you know,
but you know from the beginning of 

2925
02:08:13,660 --> 02:08:16,510
movement head movement.
So I assumed they worked on the hand 

2926
02:08:16,510 --> 02:08:18,390
movement.
I just think the pressure and the way 

2927
02:08:18,390 --> 02:08:18,570
she comes to the angry phase and all 
that shuts her down and,

2928
02:08:18,571 --> 02:08:20,120
and you know,
it's still much pressure.

2929
02:08:20,121 --> 02:08:23,510
A whole Hollywood career writes on it.
I mean that's not gonna happen now,

2930
02:08:23,511 --> 02:08:24,450
right?
I mean,

2931
02:08:24,460 --> 02:08:27,880
because buddy was a tool.
We talked about no footwork,

2932
02:08:28,010 --> 02:08:31,910
no defense thing,
but that's what nurses can do to you.

2933
02:08:31,911 --> 02:08:35,090
I would like to see a Rhonda with a 
smile on her face,

2934
02:08:35,091 --> 02:08:37,430
go tutoring,
being relaxed and calm,

2935
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:40,730
send her away,
go to a Duane Ludwig for a year and have

2936
02:08:40,731 --> 02:08:43,640
some smokers because she can still 
legally do that.

2937
02:08:43,970 --> 02:08:45,650
And other clubs.
Just striking,

2938
02:08:45,651 --> 02:08:46,170
you know,
to,

2939
02:08:46,280 --> 02:08:48,740
to just get in that moment that to see 
where you went.

2940
02:08:48,980 --> 02:08:51,380
I think in training,
this is the problem that everybody has,

2941
02:08:51,770 --> 02:08:52,610
you know,
in training,

2942
02:08:52,611 --> 02:08:53,480
you always do good.

2943
02:08:53,570 --> 02:08:58,570
A lot of guys do good,
but you know as well as I do that as 

2944
02:08:58,570 --> 02:08:58,570
these gym guys are really good in 
training,

2945
02:08:58,570 --> 02:09:00,490
they can do it on a pressure.
So if she's been boxing and working on a

2946
02:09:00,491 --> 02:09:02,180
striking and she's been hitting people 
left,

2947
02:09:02,181 --> 02:09:03,830
they're right there.
They got some good people coming in.

2948
02:09:03,831 --> 02:09:08,770
I heard that she works out even with 
boxing champions are champions and doing

2949
02:09:08,860 --> 02:09:10,970
well against this.
But then again,

2950
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:14,720
you know that that's a nice safe 
environment.

2951
02:09:14,721 --> 02:09:18,470
Bringing it under pressure with all the 
crap she had on her shoulders.

2952
02:09:18,890 --> 02:09:22,430
I thought it's also takes it away.
New is a very,

2953
02:09:22,610 --> 02:09:26,930
very dangerous punch.
Sod In strikeforce kicks right away,

2954
02:09:27,020 --> 02:09:31,640
her kicks or punches and kicks and 
punches so fucking hard and she has long

2955
02:09:31,641 --> 02:09:35,570
arms man and she puts you on the end of 
these long punches and cheat.

2956
02:09:35,580 --> 02:09:38,520
Dinged Rhonda very early in the fight 
and you could tell she was rock.

2957
02:09:38,520 --> 02:09:40,610
She goes right back into the whole 
fight.

2958
02:09:40,611 --> 02:09:41,910
That's what I think happened.
And,

2959
02:09:41,920 --> 02:09:45,290
and Nunez also leans all the way over,
so it's hard to take her down,

2960
02:09:45,291 --> 02:09:46,250
you know,
and run.

2961
02:09:46,251 --> 02:09:47,390
That should also,
you know,

2962
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:49,700
and maybe she's doing it,
I'm just saying what I don't see,

2963
02:09:49,701 --> 02:09:51,830
you know,
maybe stock wrestling over a small intel

2964
02:09:51,831 --> 02:09:53,810
because a girl like that,
but so much talent,

2965
02:09:54,020 --> 02:09:59,020
she'll pick that up so fast.
But if she suddenly suits for a singer 

2966
02:09:59,020 --> 02:10:00,150
or don't,
but she'd already been rock.

2967
02:10:00,151 --> 02:10:03,200
So I think that because remember she's 
shocked her off clenches.

2968
02:10:03,260 --> 02:10:03,370
Yeah,

2969
02:10:03,550 --> 02:10:06,210
his upper body couch and she always 
reaches him with the left arm.

2970
02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:07,990
It's like this,
you know Greg Jackson,

2971
02:10:07,991 --> 02:10:12,991
I talked about it after the Holly Holm 
fight that they had seen every single 

2972
02:10:12,991 --> 02:10:12,991
one of her fights.
She comes at you,

2973
02:10:13,180 --> 02:10:14,740
she got that left arm,
extended,

2974
02:10:14,770 --> 02:10:16,600
tries to get ahold of girls with left 
arm hip,

2975
02:10:16,601 --> 02:10:17,920
tosses them,
gets them on the ground,

2976
02:10:17,921 --> 02:10:19,390
armbars on.
And they just were.

2977
02:10:19,391 --> 02:10:19,640
So

2978
02:10:20,410 --> 02:10:23,870
that was going to say,
interesting that home shifting from mma,

2979
02:10:23,900 --> 02:10:26,990
from boxing Dema just trained for Ronda 
Rousey fight.

2980
02:10:27,020 --> 02:10:28,970
Cody car brand.
Remember Shit as a kickboxing,

2981
02:10:29,030 --> 02:10:30,290
kickboxing,
and boxing champ,

2982
02:10:30,291 --> 02:10:34,040
but I'm saying in terms of our MMA prep,
the goal was Ronda Rousey right

2983
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:36,800
and now with cody garbrandt he talked 
about in high school,

2984
02:10:36,890 --> 02:10:38,690
Dominick Cruz.
And you think you wonder,

2985
02:10:38,691 --> 02:10:39,310
well,
the,

2986
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:40,430
the laser focus,
right?

2987
02:10:40,431 --> 02:10:45,431
The television,
obviously you have to work on 

2988
02:10:45,431 --> 02:10:47,051
everything,
but if that's your target and you see 

2989
02:10:47,051 --> 02:10:48,650
what he did to cruise it,
well there's a lot of fighters like that

2990
02:10:48,651 --> 02:10:53,651
that attract greatness.
Like I think Anderson Silva attracted 

2991
02:10:53,651 --> 02:10:56,441
greatness and I think one of the reasons
why Weidman became as great as he was 

2992
02:10:56,441 --> 02:10:57,320
because he knew that Anderson Silva was 
at the top of the mountain.

2993
02:10:57,450 --> 02:10:58,380
Can you see that?
That,

2994
02:10:58,640 --> 02:11:00,190
that assassin,
you know,

2995
02:11:00,200 --> 02:11:03,270
and Weidman caught him like right at the
right time and you know,

2996
02:11:03,290 --> 02:11:06,630
knocked them out and then the broken leg
and the second fight and it.

2997
02:11:06,700 --> 02:11:11,700
I think when you have a dominant 
champion like Anderson was for so many 

2998
02:11:11,700 --> 02:11:12,620
years,
all those young kids coming up,

2999
02:11:12,621 --> 02:11:15,560
that's who they aspire to and raises the
bar like I want.

3000
02:11:15,590 --> 02:11:18,450
I'm really curious to see what the 
flyweights look like in a few years.

3001
02:11:18,451 --> 02:11:23,451
Yes.
Because of how good mighty mouse is 

3002
02:11:23,451 --> 02:11:25,580
because his bar,
he's raised it so it's way above 

3003
02:11:25,580 --> 02:11:25,580
everybody else.
But yeah,

3004
02:11:25,580 --> 02:11:25,580
but,
uh,

3005
02:11:25,580 --> 02:11:30,311
you know,
and associate for getting to coastal 

3006
02:11:30,311 --> 02:11:30,311
planning for two feet next to each 
other,

3007
02:11:30,311 --> 02:11:34,660
having no for backwards site and we'll 
let her will move with whatsoever you 

3008
02:11:34,660 --> 02:11:37,781
can only lean as much backwards.
Right for that left hook he received 

3009
02:11:37,781 --> 02:11:37,781
from Weipa and well,
you know,

3010
02:11:37,781 --> 02:11:42,531
when he fought Weidman,
it had a very clever move that a lot of 

3011
02:11:42,531 --> 02:11:46,091
people missed.
And what he did was he threw a right 

3012
02:11:46,091 --> 02:11:46,091
hand and then behind the right hand 
threw,

3013
02:11:46,091 --> 02:11:49,640
he threw a back fist so there was a,
a punch coming from the left and then he

3014
02:11:49,641 --> 02:11:54,641
moved towards it and another punch 
coming towards left because it was a 

3015
02:11:54,641 --> 02:11:55,820
left hook because the Anderson is doing 
is bobbing and weaving stuff.

3016
02:11:55,880 --> 02:11:57,080
But when a punch comes out,
um,

3017
02:11:57,081 --> 02:11:59,710
and then a backfill,
he's got to go that way up.

3018
02:11:59,750 --> 02:12:02,180
So then he's got to go that way.
So when he went back,

3019
02:12:02,181 --> 02:12:07,181
right,
that's when Chris Weidman cracked him 

3020
02:12:07,181 --> 02:12:09,071
with that long left.
That's the same punch that he used to 

3021
02:12:09,071 --> 02:12:11,981
knock out your rial hall.
He throws this long straight armed hook 

3022
02:12:11,981 --> 02:12:13,970
and it's very deceiving how much 
distance you can cover with it,

3023
02:12:14,230 --> 02:12:15,330
you know?
Yeah.

3024
02:12:15,590 --> 02:12:17,610
A lot of distance.
Plus it sent straight spot.

3025
02:12:17,690 --> 02:12:19,560
Straight punches are better as well.
I always say,

3026
02:12:19,561 --> 02:12:24,561
you know,
that's why I always liked to use 

3027
02:12:24,561 --> 02:12:24,561
clotheslines.
Yeah,

3028
02:12:24,561 --> 02:12:24,890
I mean you have more reach.
If you connect with a left hook,

3029
02:12:25,060 --> 02:12:27,300
you'll wait to see if the person doesn't
move your weight,

3030
02:12:27,301 --> 02:12:30,590
your close for a straight punch.
But if you make it a palm strike,

3031
02:12:30,860 --> 02:12:32,690
now we have some space that we can 
cover.

3032
02:12:32,720 --> 02:12:35,900
What did you think a Yoel Romero 
knocking out Weidman was not insane.

3033
02:12:36,350 --> 02:12:41,350
Why did,
why did white men even wanted to go for 

3034
02:12:41,350 --> 02:12:41,350
that?
I mean,

3035
02:12:41,350 --> 02:12:41,750
he had the whole training camp.
He said,

3036
02:12:41,751 --> 02:12:43,370
I don't what she said,
I have no clue.

3037
02:12:43,390 --> 02:12:46,430
I did it because we,
we knew we should not do that.

3038
02:12:46,700 --> 02:12:48,470
And as soon as she lowered himself,
it was.

3039
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:50,120
Yeah,
it just glided.

3040
02:12:50,121 --> 02:12:53,080
There's just a perfect knee because he 
was doing freaking awesome.

3041
02:12:53,090 --> 02:12:54,970
We did exactly what I said in the game 
plan,

3042
02:12:54,971 --> 02:12:56,060
and you'll go,
go,

3043
02:12:56,061 --> 02:12:57,380
go.
It doesn't matter if he keep him down,

3044
02:12:57,381 --> 02:12:59,180
take him.
They'll get all those muscles working.

3045
02:12:59,620 --> 02:13:01,080
I'm trying to get them tired.
Uh,

3046
02:13:01,081 --> 02:13:05,090
and it was working for him until you're 
well decided to wrestle with them.

3047
02:13:05,360 --> 02:13:07,820
And then he was thrown Weidman around 
that second round.

3048
02:13:08,330 --> 02:13:11,180
That's when you realize how strong a 
wrestler he is,

3049
02:13:11,540 --> 02:13:13,700
how good his wrestling.
Another saying,

3050
02:13:14,320 --> 02:13:19,320
the wrestling of the high level,
Olympic caliber and get our to dangerous

3051
02:13:20,151 --> 02:13:25,151
dudes.
That's why he's the freak of all free 

3052
02:13:25,151 --> 02:13:28,930
stands next to all of them.
It just looks like what in the fuck did 

3053
02:13:28,930 --> 02:13:30,320
they feed you in Cuba?
But the same thing with him.

3054
02:13:30,380 --> 02:13:32,220
Can you imagine if he starts focusing

3055
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:36,210
on the right side a little bit more?
What a super freaked his guy is going to

3056
02:13:36,211 --> 02:13:38,910
be because all those attacks are coming 
to left leg,

3057
02:13:38,911 --> 02:13:39,930
left knee,
left straight,

3058
02:13:39,960 --> 02:13:42,320
pretty much the only way time when he 
uses the right look,

3059
02:13:42,321 --> 02:13:45,330
he gets to set up a straight punch or 
kick or whatever.

3060
02:13:45,510 --> 02:13:47,820
And he doesn't throw with power,
you should counter that,

3061
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:50,720
that right kick that distros outside 
lack or inside leg,

3062
02:13:50,730 --> 02:13:55,730
whatever statute.
But you should counter that instantly 

3063
02:13:55,730 --> 02:13:55,730
because otherwise the big hand is going 
to come.

3064
02:13:55,730 --> 02:13:57,990
But if he starts developing a right and 
a right kick,

3065
02:13:58,210 --> 02:14:02,190
just do things so right near right who,
whatever he is,

3066
02:14:02,230 --> 02:14:04,520
he too muscular and I know it's late for
you.

3067
02:14:04,720 --> 02:14:06,210
But that's what I'm saying.
But it's like

3068
02:14:07,400 --> 02:14:10,160
you look at a guy like that because you 
save physical specimen man,

3069
02:14:10,161 --> 02:14:12,110
just so incredibly,
uh,

3070
02:14:12,140 --> 02:14:13,520
above and beyond,
but yet,

3071
02:14:14,120 --> 02:14:19,120
okay,
it's working for him while he's humble 

3072
02:14:19,120 --> 02:14:19,120
Johnson.
Yep.

3073
02:14:19,120 --> 02:14:20,810
So it's definitely not a problem.
It just has to manage it.

3074
02:14:20,811 --> 02:14:25,811
Like in a lot of ways,
the same way tyron woodley uses his 

3075
02:14:25,811 --> 02:14:26,780
power.
He's obviously much more muscular,

3076
02:14:26,790 --> 02:14:28,970
much stronger than most guys in that 
division.

3077
02:14:29,180 --> 02:14:32,360
And he showed the wonderboy fight,
the Woodley knows how to manage it.

3078
02:14:32,361 --> 02:14:34,790
And I came out,
he went full five rounds.

3079
02:14:34,820 --> 02:14:38,060
And what's really important is that he 
stunned wonderboy and the fourth.

3080
02:14:38,270 --> 02:14:43,270
So they're in the championship round,
still rocked him and hurt him bad and 

3081
02:14:43,270 --> 02:14:43,370
had them in deep,
deep trouble.

3082
02:14:43,640 --> 02:14:48,640
So I feel like there's so many benefits 
to being as powerful as Yellow Romero 

3083
02:14:48,640 --> 02:14:49,970
is.
There's definitely a downside.

3084
02:14:50,180 --> 02:14:55,180
The downside is if a guy like Weidman 
didn't shoot for that and was constantly

3085
02:14:56,031 --> 02:15:01,031
wearing on him,
constantly grinding on him and had him 

3086
02:15:01,031 --> 02:15:03,551
in a bit of trouble,
like Tim Kennedy had been his second 

3087
02:15:03,551 --> 02:15:03,551
round,
then you know,

3088
02:15:03,551 --> 02:15:03,551
we'll see what happens.

3089
02:15:03,551 --> 02:15:06,650
It hasn't happened yet.
I mean even in the Kennedy fight,

3090
02:15:06,651 --> 02:15:08,420
he definitely cheated.
Right.

3091
02:15:08,421 --> 02:15:13,100
You definitely saw that and,
and he was tired,

3092
02:15:13,101 --> 02:15:16,150
but they still at knockout power,
he's still recovering.

3093
02:15:16,160 --> 02:15:18,620
I still came back to fuck Kennedy and it
was like,

3094
02:15:18,621 --> 02:15:21,500
Jesus Christ,
he's such a monster.

3095
02:15:21,770 --> 02:15:26,770
He's so.
He's so much better of an athlete than 

3096
02:15:26,770 --> 02:15:28,310
almost anybody else in the division.
When he throws guys around,

3097
02:15:28,660 --> 02:15:30,500
he just,
they could just go sailing.

3098
02:15:31,170 --> 02:15:36,170
Or guys who.
I've always been impressed with a guy 

3099
02:15:36,170 --> 02:15:40,450
who mean the guy with the striking to me
and he well fucked him up to hit him 

3100
02:15:45,531 --> 02:15:47,310
with that spinning back fist and hit 
them all.

3101
02:15:47,420 --> 02:15:52,420
All hurt.
Came back from that fight in one good 

3102
02:15:52,420 --> 02:15:55,740
thoroughbreds mare.
A lot of great fights and what know know

3103
02:15:55,760 --> 02:16:00,760
Yoel Romero one,
he wanted the decision but the cision 

3104
02:16:00,760 --> 02:16:01,600
was overturned because of the drug.
So yeah,

3105
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:07,000
he had some sort of peptides that they 
found in the supplement that he was 

3106
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:11,681
taking.
So they only gave him like a nine month 

3107
02:16:11,681 --> 02:16:11,681
suspension was Saint Joe's took

3108
02:16:11,681 --> 02:16:13,250
for understanding.
That's why I don't watch to me was like,

3109
02:16:13,260 --> 02:16:15,590
that was kind of weird because he is 
managed by.

3110
02:16:16,790 --> 02:16:17,720
No,
definitely not.

3111
02:16:17,721 --> 02:16:18,370
Okay.
I thought that.

3112
02:16:18,420 --> 02:16:18,920
No,
no,

3113
02:16:18,921 --> 02:16:23,921
no.
He had some growth hormone thing inside 

3114
02:16:23,921 --> 02:16:24,260
of it.
Whereas Jones had clomifene.

3115
02:16:24,710 --> 02:16:26,440
Clomifene is,
uh,

3116
02:16:26,720 --> 02:16:31,720
an estrogen suppressor that people use,
kickstart their testosterone production 

3117
02:16:31,720 --> 02:16:34,420
after a steroid cycle.
It's an extra burden.

3118
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:35,900
Estrogen rather,
um,

3119
02:16:36,290 --> 02:16:39,490
suppressing the first one who brought 
actually the product that he says,

3120
02:16:39,491 --> 02:16:42,890
this is what I looked into it and that's
what I never.

3121
02:16:43,030 --> 02:16:45,370
I always said that the older fighters 
say,

3122
02:16:45,371 --> 02:16:46,440
but nobody,
if I would be,

3123
02:16:46,450 --> 02:16:48,430
the guy would say this is what it took 
police test is,

3124
02:16:48,431 --> 02:16:50,970
and he said,
are you a proponent like cut?

3125
02:16:50,971 --> 02:16:55,971
A lot of people say why?
What do supplements actually do for the 

3126
02:16:55,971 --> 02:16:58,971
the,
the athlete if this is what's been 

3127
02:16:58,971 --> 02:16:59,290
happening with attendance where you get 
your supplements from there.

3128
02:16:59,291 --> 02:17:03,460
The real issue with supplements is some 
of them definitely work,

3129
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:04,570
you know,
I mean,

3130
02:17:04,571 --> 02:17:09,571
how much should you be allowed to 
enhance your body with nutritional 

3131
02:17:09,571 --> 02:17:09,571
supplements?

3132
02:17:09,571 --> 02:17:13,640
Right?
Because there's a lot of supplements at 

3133
02:17:13,640 --> 02:17:15,031
work.
Creatine works is a lot of stuff that 

3134
02:17:15,031 --> 02:17:15,031
works,
so you have to figure out like,

3135
02:17:15,031 --> 02:17:15,640
okay,
well how much can it work?

3136
02:17:15,790 --> 02:17:20,790
You know,
it obviously can't work like Andrew on 

3137
02:17:20,790 --> 02:17:21,820
or all those hormone precursors that 
they've all band.

3138
02:17:21,821 --> 02:17:23,050
Okay,
well it can't work that good.

3139
02:17:23,330 --> 02:17:28,330
Can it work as good as this?
And then like there's all these 

3140
02:17:28,330 --> 02:17:28,330
different,
you know,

3141
02:17:28,330 --> 02:17:28,330
standards.
I mean there's,

3142
02:17:28,330 --> 02:17:32,190
there's certain protocols that people 
follow when ti comes of it turns to have

3143
02:17:32,191 --> 02:17:37,191
a vitamin replacements and they do ivy 
vitamin drips and extreme concentration 

3144
02:17:38,261 --> 02:17:40,270
on their nutrition and they have 
results.

3145
02:17:40,850 --> 02:17:42,220
Those results,
they,

3146
02:17:42,310 --> 02:17:47,310
they tend to show that there are 
benefits in supplementation and there's 

3147
02:17:47,310 --> 02:17:52,081
definitely benefits and clean diet and 
making sure that your nutritional 

3148
02:17:52,081 --> 02:17:55,621
balances.
So like at what level should it be 

3149
02:17:55,621 --> 02:17:55,621
illegal?
You know what I mean?

3150
02:17:55,621 --> 02:17:55,900
You can't.
How you found the fuck.

3151
02:17:55,910 --> 02:17:57,850
Are you getting so much?
Be Twelve out of nature.

3152
02:17:58,080 --> 02:17:59,860
They're not.
You have to take it in a pill.

3153
02:17:59,980 --> 02:18:02,050
Then it gives you energy.
Well what the fuck is that?

3154
02:18:02,660 --> 02:18:05,180
And you could take some caffeine like 
Chael Sonnen,

3155
02:18:05,181 --> 02:18:10,181
he used to take caffeine pills to make 
sure that he got the exact amount of 

3156
02:18:10,181 --> 02:18:13,771
caffeine because he's like,
you don't know because you get a 

3157
02:18:13,771 --> 02:18:13,771
starbucks,
you might get a Venti starbucks and they

3158
02:18:13,771 --> 02:18:17,590
might've fucking packed it in tight and 
chews the shit out of it and you can get

3159
02:18:17,591 --> 02:18:22,591
a cup of coffee like coffee.
So it might actually test over.

3160
02:18:22,841 --> 02:18:26,410
So in order to make sure that jail was 
in the the lines,

3161
02:18:26,530 --> 02:18:28,640
he would take pills.
Caffeine is illegal.

3162
02:18:28,641 --> 02:18:31,050
It's sort of lifts legal.
Illegal.

3163
02:18:31,360 --> 02:18:33,550
Yeah.
But if you get to a certain number,

3164
02:18:33,650 --> 02:18:34,680
it's illegal.
Okay.

3165
02:18:34,700 --> 02:18:37,690
If you get past a certain amount of 
milligrams in your system,

3166
02:18:38,060 --> 02:18:39,160
I don't know how they mentioned that.

3167
02:18:39,160 --> 02:18:40,790
That's the other thing that 
testosterone,

3168
02:18:40,800 --> 02:18:45,800
deputy testosterone or talk to medical 
professionals and everyone saying men 

3169
02:18:45,800 --> 02:18:47,680
you produce supposed to be around one 
took one.

3170
02:18:47,710 --> 02:18:48,580
That's all.
Yeah.

3171
02:18:48,581 --> 02:18:51,100
Unless you're some weird freak,
you might be like one to two.

3172
02:18:51,540 --> 02:18:54,400
Okay.
So four to one or six to one.

3173
02:18:55,330 --> 02:18:56,080
How does that,
you know,

3174
02:18:56,081 --> 02:19:01,081
that's always been.
What about is wanting to learn and for 

3175
02:19:02,690 --> 02:19:05,150
injury recovery,
Joe and I know a lot of people.

3176
02:19:05,320 --> 02:19:06,270
Fighters.
That's what they said.

3177
02:19:06,271 --> 02:19:08,080
Well Geez,
I had a mortgage.

3178
02:19:08,081 --> 02:19:09,580
I have to fight.
I got to support the family.

3179
02:19:09,910 --> 02:19:14,440
Is there a way to monitor that where 
even though the band steroid thing where

3180
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:19,560
you can allow a person to at least make 
a living without making it an 

3181
02:19:19,560 --> 02:19:20,310
enhancement?
Well,

3182
02:19:20,311 --> 02:19:22,740
it's going to be an enhancement.
That's the problem right away.

3183
02:19:22,741 --> 02:19:27,741
When is he going to be an enhancement,
but if you take steroids while you're 

3184
02:19:27,741 --> 02:19:31,350
like say if you have a knee surgery and 
then he takes steroids and then you're 

3185
02:19:31,350 --> 02:19:33,851
lifting weights the entire time,
so you're going to keep some of those 

3186
02:19:33,851 --> 02:19:36,461
games,
you're going to keep a certain 

3187
02:19:36,461 --> 02:19:36,461
percentage of it,
but on the flip side,

3188
02:19:36,461 --> 02:19:40,631
your endocrine system is going to be 
fucked up and it's going to take you a 

3189
02:19:40,631 --> 02:19:40,670
while to get back to normal testosterone
production.

3190
02:19:40,910 --> 02:19:44,840
If you do end up testing and you do go 
back on Usada after the injury.

3191
02:19:45,140 --> 02:19:47,450
So there's an argument so that you're 
taking a risk,

3192
02:19:47,630 --> 02:19:52,630
you do recover quicker,
but it might not be better for your 

3193
02:19:52,630 --> 02:19:52,630
overall hormone system.
Right?

3194
02:19:52,630 --> 02:19:54,710
You know,
I remember I was talking about it,

3195
02:19:54,950 --> 02:19:56,190
we did it on the podcast.
I don't,

3196
02:19:56,191 --> 02:20:00,250
I don't memorize have it memorized,
but there was a test but testosterone,

3197
02:20:00,260 --> 02:20:02,130
what they did in the Olympics,
Bri,

3198
02:20:02,180 --> 02:20:02,960
Bri,
uh,

3199
02:20:02,990 --> 02:20:07,460
steroids and after steroids and they 
start really testing biological passport

3200
02:20:07,490 --> 02:20:12,490
and they say that it actually did not 
help that more people who didn't use had

3201
02:20:13,491 --> 02:20:16,040
better results than the people who were 
using.

3202
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:18,860
And it was same thing as me.
I get that face,

3203
02:20:18,861 --> 02:20:20,030
what you have now,
two analysts,

3204
02:20:20,090 --> 02:20:20,990
but uh,
you know,

3205
02:20:21,030 --> 02:20:22,850
I'll look it up and you know what I'm 
saying,

3206
02:20:23,700 --> 02:20:28,700
whenever the Russians are doing whatever
they're doing to do it because they got 

3207
02:20:28,700 --> 02:20:30,770
a fucking state sponsored program,
you know,

3208
02:20:30,771 --> 02:20:33,020
United States is working hard to try to 
clean it up.

3209
02:20:33,050 --> 02:20:35,780
I mean they have baseball players have 
to go in front of Congress.

3210
02:20:35,960 --> 02:20:37,730
They arrest people,
people getting locked up.

3211
02:20:37,731 --> 02:20:40,380
You saw to jeff and Wicki cron up 
everybody's ass.

3212
02:20:40,381 --> 02:20:45,381
We're trying to find people that are 
still steerer using steroids and 

3213
02:20:45,381 --> 02:20:46,580
cheating and Russia now like,
what are we going to like?

3214
02:20:46,590 --> 02:20:50,570
Candy?
Let's fucking make it happen.

3215
02:20:51,340 --> 02:20:54,860
You need to be faster.
The stuff that I got from a horse,

3216
02:20:55,840 --> 02:20:58,680
stick it inside your body and see if you
become a horse.

3217
02:21:00,060 --> 02:21:05,060
Crazy tests in the early days.
Also we'd like making super soldiers in 

3218
02:21:05,060 --> 02:21:07,410
injecting people with like plutonium,
like a live person.

3219
02:21:07,430 --> 02:21:12,430
This is what happened.
If he'd like the freaking Wolf Hall and 

3220
02:21:12,720 --> 02:21:14,200
they watched so many comic books.

3221
02:21:14,510 --> 02:21:19,510
I mean they,
they almost kicked the entire Russian 

3222
02:21:19,510 --> 02:21:20,230
Olympics the Olympics.
The Olympics in Brazil,

3223
02:21:20,780 --> 02:21:21,290
they were like,
Hey,

3224
02:21:21,291 --> 02:21:26,030
what the fuck?
At the last minute they decided not to,

3225
02:21:26,031 --> 02:21:27,350
but they've been going back,
you know,

3226
02:21:27,351 --> 02:21:32,351
they use the old samples from 2008 and 
12 and they've already kicked out to a 

3227
02:21:32,351 --> 02:21:34,250
Russian Olympic gold medalists in 
wrestling.

3228
02:21:34,730 --> 02:21:39,730
They were on the shit.
They're on the shit that just on this 

3229
02:21:39,730 --> 02:21:40,190
undetectable shit or some shit that they
don't detect yet.

3230
02:21:40,220 --> 02:21:42,020
Which of course,
and when you see him.

3231
02:21:42,050 --> 02:21:47,010
Oh yeah.
I mean lifting straight from you,

3232
02:21:47,140 --> 02:21:50,910
like the sport.
Is it ever going to be clean?

3233
02:21:50,911 --> 02:21:55,911
Well,
it's way cleaner now in the UFC that 

3234
02:21:55,911 --> 02:21:55,911
it's ever been before,
but I think there's also.

3235
02:21:55,911 --> 02:21:58,610
I liked the fact that one fcs available 
for guys who don't want to be clean.

3236
02:21:58,850 --> 02:22:03,850
Yeah.
Risings available for guys who don't 

3237
02:22:03,850 --> 02:22:03,850
want to be clean.
You know,

3238
02:22:03,850 --> 02:22:04,520
there's an argument either way,
there's an argument for the pride way,

3239
02:22:04,610 --> 02:22:07,040
which was everybody knew that everybody 
was on it.

3240
02:22:07,690 --> 02:22:09,750
Tested pride.
Right.

3241
02:22:13,220 --> 02:22:14,210
Hey boss,
what's this?

3242
02:22:14,240 --> 02:22:16,790
Why is this a viable?
Just civic here.

3243
02:22:16,791 --> 02:22:17,320
I mean,
buddy,

3244
02:22:17,630 --> 02:22:20,350
I did this thing believable decoder,
the boss to her.

3245
02:22:20,351 --> 02:22:23,360
I was going backstage with the camera 
showing everybody,

3246
02:22:23,361 --> 02:22:24,220
hey man,
what's up here?

3247
02:22:24,221 --> 02:22:26,130
You don't look there spending training

3248
02:22:26,130 --> 02:22:27,570
and you know,
and then I say okay,

3249
02:22:27,780 --> 02:22:31,650
we walk into the room from the doctors.
So I opened the door and I looked at the

3250
02:22:31,651 --> 02:22:34,980
side and I see all the protests there 
with little sticks on them.

3251
02:22:35,070 --> 02:22:36,970
Right.
And I closed the door right away to look

3252
02:22:36,971 --> 02:22:37,550
into camera.
I said,

3253
02:22:37,560 --> 02:22:40,170
give me one moment to the very busy,
let me walk in and ask for permission.

3254
02:22:40,171 --> 02:22:45,171
So I walk in and I grabbed one of those 
cups and I see green tea or fill it up 

3255
02:22:45,171 --> 02:22:49,290
and it put the same cup next to it.
So then when you weren't even allowed to

3256
02:22:49,500 --> 02:22:51,300
be that close.
So yeah,

3257
02:22:51,350 --> 02:22:51,820
yeah,
she,

3258
02:22:51,830 --> 02:22:53,670
she,
I could have contaminated everything.

3259
02:22:53,970 --> 02:22:55,740
So I'm walking in and I'm saying,
oh,

3260
02:22:55,760 --> 02:22:57,770
these had a doctors here and they looked
at us and go,

3261
02:22:57,771 --> 02:22:59,100
Oh hey,
the tests.

3262
02:22:59,550 --> 02:23:00,270
I said,
man,

3263
02:23:00,660 --> 02:23:02,670
wouldn't it be great if you can taste

3264
02:23:02,780 --> 02:23:07,610
what fighter it is?
And these people,

3265
02:23:07,611 --> 02:23:10,370
they looked at me and so I take my green
tea

3266
02:23:10,780 --> 02:23:12,650
and I take the thing off.
And they go like,

3267
02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:12,970
no,
no,

3268
02:23:12,971 --> 02:23:13,150
no,
no,

3269
02:23:13,151 --> 02:23:13,440
no,
no,

3270
02:23:14,460 --> 02:23:15,480
take a little sip.
And I said,

3271
02:23:16,100 --> 02:23:16,570
I go

3272
02:23:17,290 --> 02:23:22,290
coleman or freaking gold.
There was a clear illustration,

3273
02:23:25,691 --> 02:23:26,980
obviously.
Serious.

3274
02:23:27,070 --> 02:23:28,280
Yeah,
not water,

3275
02:23:30,680 --> 02:23:35,680
you know,
it's been real open about it and talked 

3276
02:23:35,680 --> 02:23:35,860
about like they literally said in large 
prints,

3277
02:23:35,861 --> 02:23:37,740
we do not test you forest

3278
02:23:40,360 --> 02:23:41,390
thing,
you know,

3279
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,290
I,
I knew a guy from there and he would say

3280
02:23:44,291 --> 02:23:47,530
to me that in the morning he would take 
a huge runs of

3281
02:23:47,760 --> 02:23:52,760
testosterone because it made him really 
angry in the morning.

3282
02:23:53,110 --> 02:23:56,300
That jacked up once far.
And Andy,

3283
02:23:56,380 --> 02:23:59,310
what about these guys who were like 
bench pressing the day before,

3284
02:23:59,311 --> 02:24:00,270
you know,
all these muscles

3285
02:24:00,300 --> 02:24:01,280
guy.
So when they got in,

3286
02:24:01,290 --> 02:24:06,290
you know that you have the white dude.
I have these guys because of the 

3287
02:24:06,290 --> 02:24:08,670
cosmetic thing.
Pride would love to the freaks,

3288
02:24:08,700 --> 02:24:10,070
my man.
And that's a,

3289
02:24:10,071 --> 02:24:11,370
you know,
a lot of matchmaking

3290
02:24:11,910 --> 02:24:13,820
guys.
Remember Jason Chambers from,

3291
02:24:15,360 --> 02:24:18,080
he went over to Japan,
I forget which organization was that?

3292
02:24:18,081 --> 02:24:23,081
They,
they want him to fight one 85 and he's 

3293
02:24:23,081 --> 02:24:23,081
like,
wait one 70.

3294
02:24:23,081 --> 02:24:23,220
And they're like,
don't worry,

3295
02:24:23,340 --> 02:24:28,340
we'll get you on this title.
He wanted him to juice up and go to one 

3296
02:24:28,611 --> 02:24:29,420
85.
And he was like,

3297
02:24:29,421 --> 02:24:30,230
what in the fuck?

3298
02:24:32,750 --> 02:24:33,950
That's the problem.
You know what?

3299
02:24:33,951 --> 02:24:36,160
But people say he,
they say they should just allow it.

3300
02:24:36,161 --> 02:24:41,161
I say yeah,
but then you force the guys who want to 

3301
02:24:41,161 --> 02:24:41,161
stay clean to use it as well.
And you shouldn't.

3302
02:24:41,161 --> 02:24:42,050
Joel mentioned earlier,
I mean the health,

3303
02:24:42,080 --> 02:24:47,080
there are health risks risks,
but I think not even health risks,

3304
02:24:47,391 --> 02:24:49,350
I think it doesn't damage your,
your

3305
02:24:49,480 --> 02:24:54,480
system when you do steroids.
Well it depends on how much you're 

3306
02:24:54,480 --> 02:24:54,480
doing,
but if you're,

3307
02:24:54,480 --> 02:24:56,040
if you're going like super hyper human 
levels,

3308
02:24:56,050 --> 02:24:58,960
like I'm sure a lot of those guys were a
yes for you.

3309
02:24:59,170 --> 02:25:01,720
And it's one of the real clear 
indicators that a lot of guys were on it

3310
02:25:01,721 --> 02:25:04,680
were how they got off of it and came to 
the UFC and looked like models.

3311
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:09,340
They look like cumin pitbulls right away
with a lot of them.

3312
02:25:09,700 --> 02:25:10,570
Yeah.
I'm a lot of them.

3313
02:25:10,571 --> 02:25:11,260
I mean,
it's just,

3314
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:16,680
it is what it is and it's a.
unfortunately the early roots of mma 

3315
02:25:16,680 --> 02:25:21,241
were marred like it's,
it's almost all people that took 

3316
02:25:21,241 --> 02:25:21,241
steroids.
I mean,

3317
02:25:21,241 --> 02:25:22,390
there's so many camps.
If you talked to the insiders,

3318
02:25:22,570 --> 02:25:23,750
they will tell,
God dammit,

3319
02:25:23,770 --> 02:25:26,170
back then everybody was on,
everybody was on,

3320
02:25:26,380 --> 02:25:31,380
you know,
and you don't have to name names and 

3321
02:25:31,380 --> 02:25:31,380
everybody who knows knows and it doesn't
matter,

3322
02:25:31,380 --> 02:25:34,300
but what does matter is that when you 
look at the early days of the sport,

3323
02:25:34,330 --> 02:25:37,600
it was insane,
essentially contaminated and now they've

3324
02:25:37,601 --> 02:25:42,601
wiped out a giant percentage of it and 
occasionally guys still get caught with 

3325
02:25:42,601 --> 02:25:44,520
some things and you know,
Cyborg got caught with a,

3326
02:25:44,530 --> 02:25:45,530
some sort of quick.

3327
02:25:45,700 --> 02:25:50,110
Yeah.
That's also spironolactone is also a dht

3328
02:25:50,111 --> 02:25:52,690
inhibitor.
It's dihydrotestosterone,

3329
02:25:52,691 --> 02:25:57,691
which is a derivative of testosterone 
which makes your hair fall out and I 

3330
02:25:57,691 --> 02:25:59,440
used to use that spironolactone stuff 
that she got caught with.

3331
02:25:59,441 --> 02:26:01,840
I used to rub that shit in my head to 
keep my hair from falling out.

3332
02:26:02,610 --> 02:26:03,270
Yeah,
boss.

3333
02:26:03,330 --> 02:26:06,030
I'm taking notes.
I feel like I'm studying under professor

3334
02:26:06,031 --> 02:26:07,500
Rogan right now.
This is amazing,

3335
02:26:07,501 --> 02:26:08,080
but

3336
02:26:09,240 --> 02:26:14,000
it's also used by people who want to 
shield themselves from tests.

3337
02:26:14,360 --> 02:26:19,360
It's also used by females that have 
taken male hormones and they want to 

3338
02:26:19,360 --> 02:26:20,570
reduce the effects of the extra 
androgens.

3339
02:26:21,080 --> 02:26:22,060
Yeah,
so there's a lot of.

3340
02:26:22,150 --> 02:26:23,000
A lot of factors.

3341
02:26:23,180 --> 02:26:25,030
Yeah.
Once they start growing hair,

3342
02:26:25,960 --> 02:26:27,790
I think,
and getting all this,

3343
02:26:29,890 --> 02:26:34,890
we would see guys come in just that you 
can tell right away,

3344
02:26:35,300 --> 02:26:37,700
Bang.
A chick and you see Werewolf back here.

3345
02:26:37,970 --> 02:26:41,090
Well,
they say to us can be as big as a thumb.

3346
02:26:41,091 --> 02:26:43,040
Right?
That's what they say though.

3347
02:26:43,430 --> 02:26:48,430
Yours.
My girth is less like pop sap bad.

3348
02:26:52,470 --> 02:26:54,710
The worst story.
I've heard some guy I was talking,

3349
02:26:54,711 --> 02:26:58,580
I'm not gonna mention names and he said,
and we were talking about that at a.

3350
02:26:58,640 --> 02:26:59,780
I go,
uh Oh man.

3351
02:26:59,781 --> 02:27:01,590
That's got to be.
That's got to be really horrible.

3352
02:27:01,670 --> 02:27:02,430
Oh No.
I had one.

3353
02:27:02,550 --> 02:27:05,760
I did a body builder and then she had 
like a big thing I do.

3354
02:27:06,080 --> 02:27:07,040
What did you do?
He said,

3355
02:27:07,070 --> 02:27:07,740
oh,
I shucked it.

3356
02:27:12,980 --> 02:27:13,700
Isn't that funny?
Look,

3357
02:27:13,701 --> 02:27:16,990
we're all good with sucking clip.
As long as they're little little,

3358
02:27:17,690 --> 02:27:19,670
but I don't care if it feels good for 
you,

3359
02:27:19,671 --> 02:27:24,671
if it's.
If I feel it more than a half an inch 

3360
02:27:24,671 --> 02:27:27,551
into my mouth is on fire,
even though it's a woman's vagina,

3361
02:27:30,010 --> 02:27:31,970
but if it comes with the accompanied 
voice,

3362
02:27:32,040 --> 02:27:37,040
the dark voice,
when you do a Netflix special,

3363
02:27:42,201 --> 02:27:46,790
a good tourist back here,
I'm not dying motherfucker.

3364
02:27:47,490 --> 02:27:52,490
You are going to be by far the fathers.
There's got to be guys who are just 

3365
02:27:52,490 --> 02:27:56,020
really into being dominated by super 
powerful women with big cliffs kind of 

3366
02:27:59,890 --> 02:28:00,520
people.
Yup,

3367
02:28:00,550 --> 02:28:01,610
Yup.
Absolutely.

3368
02:28:01,700 --> 02:28:03,200
Yeah.
Some guys are listening right now.

3369
02:28:03,201 --> 02:28:03,810
Go.
Oh yeah.

3370
02:28:03,910 --> 02:28:05,440
Oh yeah.
That's my stuff.

3371
02:28:07,880 --> 02:28:08,090
Do you

3372
02:28:08,090 --> 02:28:10,100
think that when you guys look at rise 
and right now,

3373
02:28:10,101 --> 02:28:12,800
do you think the rise in has the 
possibility of coming here,

3374
02:28:12,801 --> 02:28:15,920
putting on some fucking big shows.
They've got some good fights,

3375
02:28:15,921 --> 02:28:16,370
you know,
cro,

3376
02:28:16,371 --> 02:28:18,230
cop,
just ones that heavyweight tournament,

3377
02:28:18,240 --> 02:28:19,830
you know,
you're shaking your head over there.

3378
02:28:19,970 --> 02:28:21,860
I think they have a of success.

3379
02:28:22,580 --> 02:28:23,770
It's hard to do.
Again.

3380
02:28:23,840 --> 02:28:26,030
They go to neat after Sakharova stopped 
pride,

3381
02:28:26,040 --> 02:28:28,950
parade much went to start going to a 
star.

3382
02:28:29,060 --> 02:28:30,140
That's the thing.
Exactly.

3383
02:28:30,150 --> 02:28:31,670
You know,
you have seen it with the gay one.

3384
02:28:31,700 --> 02:28:33,770
That was the reason [inaudible] stopped 
at certain time.

3385
02:28:33,771 --> 02:28:38,771
There was no more Japanese star and they
need a good one or a fight is going to 

3386
02:28:38,771 --> 02:28:40,760
beat for Gracie's right there.
That's something that's,

3387
02:28:40,900 --> 02:28:45,900
that's a one in a lifetime deal.
What came Masato and the lighter weight 

3388
02:28:45,900 --> 02:28:46,840
was a superstar.
He will mix.

3389
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:48,050
Yeah,
I came one Max,

3390
02:28:48,051 --> 02:28:50,750
but then we'll get up to your bigger 
guys when to,

3391
02:28:51,020 --> 02:28:52,850
once you get a guy like potter Hari 
size,

3392
02:28:52,851 --> 02:28:55,520
it's just not who the fuck is going to 
be that big,

3393
02:28:55,540 --> 02:29:00,540
you know,
how that fight in her heart and rico 

3394
02:29:00,540 --> 02:29:03,881
very climactic but broke his arm but 
still interesting fight what was going 

3395
02:29:04,611 --> 02:29:06,470
on and I'm excited about a rematch.

3396
02:29:06,470 --> 02:29:10,430
So he might be wanting to come back as 
well.

3397
02:29:10,431 --> 02:29:11,880
And a boy.
Yes.

3398
02:29:12,830 --> 02:29:14,340
But against 40.
Right.

3399
02:29:15,050 --> 02:29:19,190
These guys are.
I just met the Madison Square Garden for

3400
02:29:19,191 --> 02:29:19,900
the,
uh,

3401
02:29:19,970 --> 02:29:22,940
for the wheelchairs.
The fighting a December 31st Monday.

3402
02:29:23,010 --> 02:29:25,880
Was there his trainer when you're on 
skis and uh,

3403
02:29:25,910 --> 02:29:26,960
but he,
he didn't say anything.

3404
02:29:26,961 --> 02:29:27,800
He,
he sat,

3405
02:29:27,830 --> 02:29:30,530
you know that actually I met the guy who
remembers champions.

3406
02:29:30,531 --> 02:29:32,810
He sat and he said [inaudible],
but he didn't say anything more.

3407
02:29:32,820 --> 02:29:35,670
Seventy shelter to retire because of the
heart conditions.

3408
02:29:35,780 --> 02:29:37,160
Are those by de?
Yeah,

3409
02:29:37,161 --> 02:29:39,420
it's.
So you see if a guy like uber,

3410
02:29:39,421 --> 02:29:44,421
uhm,
like back when he was ubering and when 

3411
02:29:44,421 --> 02:29:47,621
he was winning one 65 super jacked and 
then he goes to mma.

3412
02:29:48,350 --> 02:29:50,510
But you know,
Guy Wins The k Grand Prix.

3413
02:29:50,670 --> 02:29:53,280
Like you gotta wonder like a guy like 
ubereats,

3414
02:29:53,750 --> 02:29:56,540
if he came back as ubereats,
you know,

3415
02:29:56,541 --> 02:29:59,050
like I don't know if its glory or Bella 
tour,

3416
02:29:59,150 --> 02:30:04,150
whoever,
whoever has got the stones in the cash 

3417
02:30:04,150 --> 02:30:06,000
to pull them aside and said,
listen fella as work to be done here.

3418
02:30:06,010 --> 02:30:08,330
Yes you can.
They would love to do it.

3419
02:30:08,360 --> 02:30:10,880
The Diet that the horse meat,
this is my friend.

3420
02:30:10,910 --> 02:30:13,550
He's from another country and he is a 
doctor.

3421
02:30:13,770 --> 02:30:17,030
She will help you.
They will make you better,

3422
02:30:17,220 --> 02:30:18,990
stronger,
faster.

3423
02:30:19,230 --> 02:30:22,650
Comes back again,
man.

3424
02:30:23,240 --> 02:30:28,240
Back when he knocked out,
bought her daughter with a complete 

3425
02:30:28,551 --> 02:30:30,020
animal.
Belong.

3426
02:30:30,021 --> 02:30:35,021
I want to see him.
That night I broke down.

3427
02:30:35,210 --> 02:30:38,510
That was the one time in all the fights 
and everything we've seen and I remember

3428
02:30:38,570 --> 02:30:40,040
I was there,
wouldn't have Jose,

3429
02:30:40,041 --> 02:30:43,190
a pelly and John,
so it gets Brian gasaway in Canada.

3430
02:30:43,191 --> 02:30:46,370
John Mccarthy and I broke his leg,
but for some reason,

3431
02:30:46,371 --> 02:30:51,371
Saki and Spong,
I was broke down just to see because it 

3432
02:30:51,371 --> 02:30:53,030
first,
it was so visceral and all of this,

3433
02:30:53,530 --> 02:30:58,530
everything that it took for him to come 
back and put it in and then pull them 

3434
02:30:58,530 --> 02:31:01,130
down was crazy because tyrone's bong and
him are both super high level.

3435
02:31:01,150 --> 02:31:04,680
Kickbox is.
You only really saw that mostly in mma.

3436
02:31:04,730 --> 02:31:09,730
I really didn't see it that much.
A high level kickboxing and that's why 

3437
02:31:09,730 --> 02:31:11,180
we talked there is now.
I mean Matt embry,

3438
02:31:11,181 --> 02:31:16,181
this kid from Canada who's now a,
are going to be fighting in Los Angeles 

3439
02:31:16,181 --> 02:31:19,421
next week.
There's Canada to where the sport is 

3440
02:31:19,421 --> 02:31:19,421
banned in so many of the provinces.
But Joseph,

3441
02:31:19,421 --> 02:31:19,980
valvoline,
he had

3442
02:31:19,990 --> 02:31:22,710
to retire because of the concussion 
issues.

3443
02:31:22,711 --> 02:31:24,570
Um,
place on next week.

3444
02:31:25,620 --> 02:31:26,880
Awesome.
He's a smart kid,

3445
02:31:26,881 --> 02:31:27,840
man.
He's a great guy.

3446
02:31:28,950 --> 02:31:33,950
He,
I don't think he's 100 percent decided 

3447
02:31:33,950 --> 02:31:33,950
on his retirement,
but he's leaning towards that.

3448
02:31:33,950 --> 02:31:37,580
That's either concussions a,
not something you want to.

3449
02:31:37,800 --> 02:31:39,750
You want to mess with.
Remember Tj grant?

3450
02:31:39,810 --> 02:31:42,270
Yup.
He was exactly.

3451
02:31:42,300 --> 02:31:47,300
Benson had the title and a lightweight 
division never kept saying never came 

3452
02:31:47,300 --> 02:31:48,170
back and from concussions I just pumped 
up.

3453
02:31:48,171 --> 02:31:50,120
Pit Bull.
It was people who broke his shin.

3454
02:31:50,600 --> 02:31:52,220
It was in the military.
Oh,

3455
02:31:52,230 --> 02:31:53,310
that's right.
That's right.

3456
02:31:54,780 --> 02:31:56,830
That bone in the next two.
We should.

3457
02:31:57,790 --> 02:31:59,010
People are.
People love whatever it is.

3458
02:31:59,070 --> 02:32:04,070
Yeah.
It's interesting also that like we know 

3459
02:32:04,070 --> 02:32:05,400
we're talking about kickboxing,
not really gaining ground in America.

3460
02:32:05,460 --> 02:32:07,500
Ballot tourism really gain ground either
though,

3461
02:32:07,560 --> 02:32:08,020
you know,
it's,

3462
02:32:08,100 --> 02:32:10,710
it reaches a certain point in some of 
the ratings were really good.

3463
02:32:10,710 --> 02:32:13,770
Like when Kim Shamrock,
those freak show,

3464
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:20,360
Meryl Streep or Scott,
there is a promoter.

3465
02:32:23,071 --> 02:32:24,890
Always has been,
always will be in.

3466
02:32:24,900 --> 02:32:29,900
I mean he,
there's that mix where I think Bella 

3467
02:32:29,900 --> 02:32:30,690
tour has to focus on because you have to
see for the large part,

3468
02:32:30,750 --> 02:32:34,200
98 percent,
99 percent of the best talent,

3469
02:32:34,201 --> 02:32:35,880
but Bella toward trying.
But you're right,

3470
02:32:35,920 --> 02:32:38,000
and again,
I think it's also because Joel,

3471
02:32:38,010 --> 02:32:42,480
we talked about too much of everything 
[inaudible] it's every week something.

3472
02:32:43,190 --> 02:32:48,190
The UFC did it as well.
At first they got to have to fight us 

3473
02:32:48,190 --> 02:32:48,490
underneath the fight.
By having so many show,

3474
02:32:48,491 --> 02:32:51,830
she shut every hug a organization.
But then you look at guys,

3475
02:32:52,170 --> 02:32:55,970
a few guys in Beltour like Lima who just
knocked out course golf,

3476
02:32:56,010 --> 02:32:59,670
which is fuck this world class,
terrific fighter.

3477
02:32:59,671 --> 02:33:00,180
Martin,
Marla,

3478
02:33:00,200 --> 02:33:02,340
I mean world series of fighting.
Even man,

3479
02:33:02,341 --> 02:33:05,940
there's Marlon Moraes guide sheet we 
talked about,

3480
02:33:06,150 --> 02:33:06,760
was it for me?

3481
02:33:06,890 --> 02:33:11,370
For me too many times he got lit up to 
win that fight.

3482
02:33:11,640 --> 02:33:13,700
He won,
but he got hit too many times.

3483
02:33:13,720 --> 02:33:15,840
He really needs to stay.
Change his game.

3484
02:33:15,930 --> 02:33:20,930
He knows she can take a punch,
but he thinks too much advantage of it 

3485
02:33:20,930 --> 02:33:21,360
and I just don't think it's that.
What are the goals?

3486
02:33:21,361 --> 02:33:22,650
Respect.
Like realistic,

3487
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:25,170
like you say,
like even belt Torres and got traction.

3488
02:33:25,171 --> 02:33:28,000
So how do there,
how did they continue to exist?

3489
02:33:28,610 --> 02:33:33,610
It is,
it is hard because they've been around 

3490
02:33:33,610 --> 02:33:33,610
for a long time now.
World series of fighting for a long time

3491
02:33:33,610 --> 02:33:36,090
now and the hardcore hardcore fans and 
then you break it down,

3492
02:33:36,091 --> 02:33:41,091
not even regular heart rate,
hardcore hardcore are watching those 

3493
02:33:41,091 --> 02:33:41,091
events.
It's almost like we're spoiled.

3494
02:33:41,160 --> 02:33:46,110
We have too many and it's weird to say 
because how many years did we fight?

3495
02:33:46,111 --> 02:33:48,270
Hey,
look at us now.

3496
02:33:48,271 --> 02:33:49,070
It's like,
wow,

3497
02:33:49,120 --> 02:33:50,310
a tsunami of action.

3498
02:33:50,360 --> 02:33:53,400
Well the UFC has been super wise but 
it's promotion.

3499
02:33:53,430 --> 02:33:55,680
We know how to stay on top and they 
know,

3500
02:33:55,681 --> 02:34:00,681
but it just,
I would like to see a challenger emerge 

3501
02:34:00,681 --> 02:34:01,310
and like right now it doesn't,
you know,

3502
02:34:01,320 --> 02:34:03,870
there's Beltour has guys like Michael 
Chandler,

3503
02:34:03,871 --> 02:34:08,871
they've got some guys that are really 
exciting and really fun to watch and I 

3504
02:34:08,871 --> 02:34:09,420
think it'd be genuine stars.
And of course Michael,

3505
02:34:09,421 --> 02:34:13,430
a venom for sure,
and sent Cyborg.

3506
02:34:14,480 --> 02:34:18,610
Nahko was called crushing it.
Never seen him,

3507
02:34:18,611 --> 02:34:23,050
never seen him before.
Is dented in his skull.

3508
02:34:23,450 --> 02:34:28,450
It was crazy.
It was crazy timing too because you 

3509
02:34:28,450 --> 02:34:31,171
know,
cyborg charge down and it was kind of 

3510
02:34:31,171 --> 02:34:31,171
what we're talking about,
but someone shooting for a double,

3511
02:34:31,171 --> 02:34:31,840
but I don't think his knees were on the 
ground with that.

3512
02:34:31,890 --> 02:34:34,720
No,
but as he shot in Michael Venom page,

3513
02:34:34,750 --> 02:34:39,160
timed it perfectly and going down in a 
member technori Goldman Health Gracie,

3514
02:34:41,240 --> 02:34:43,290
but need burst onto the fight.

3515
02:34:43,680 --> 02:34:45,360
That was the hops last.
That's right.

3516
02:34:45,361 --> 02:34:45,890
Yeah.
Yep.

3517
02:34:46,450 --> 02:34:46,960
Yeah,
man.

3518
02:34:46,961 --> 02:34:49,090
I mean nice to a guy was trying to take 
you down.

3519
02:34:49,510 --> 02:34:51,050
It's so devastating.
You,

3520
02:34:51,051 --> 02:34:56,051
you,
you have to commit to that knee or 

3521
02:34:56,051 --> 02:34:56,051
commit to that takedown.
Get caught coming in like that.

3522
02:34:56,570 --> 02:34:59,470
Like you could shoot with what he went 
in front of your face.

3523
02:34:59,471 --> 02:35:04,471
It's very hard.
That was probably the most horrific 

3524
02:35:04,471 --> 02:35:04,471
injury I've ever seen in MMA.
I think so,

3525
02:35:04,471 --> 02:35:04,850
yeah.
Like afterwards,

3526
02:35:04,870 --> 02:35:05,760
the pictures,
you know,

3527
02:35:05,770 --> 02:35:08,800
with all these little lights on them and
saying he wants to fight again.

3528
02:35:08,920 --> 02:35:12,300
He's nobody's retiring.
Just announced.

3529
02:35:12,790 --> 02:35:17,790
Yeah.
I think he snapped back after the fact 

3530
02:35:17,790 --> 02:35:17,790
and we just really realized like,
wow,

3531
02:35:17,790 --> 02:35:19,720
the fucking egg that contains my brain 
is cracked.

3532
02:35:20,440 --> 02:35:25,440
I'm like,
it's amazing that he recovered the way 

3533
02:35:25,440 --> 02:35:25,560
he did as far as I can.
After seeing the,

3534
02:35:25,590 --> 02:35:30,590
the x rays and pictures,
it tuition was fucking insane.

3535
02:35:31,250 --> 02:35:34,780
I thought he'd be dead and now you think
some of the skull was crushed like that.

3536
02:35:34,781 --> 02:35:36,130
They're dead.
I went to fingers.

3537
02:35:38,110 --> 02:35:39,610
That's the touch.
Something of the,

3538
02:35:39,700 --> 02:35:41,620
of the brain that does something to you.
Right?

3539
02:35:41,621 --> 02:35:42,910
It's a scary thing if you think about 
it.

3540
02:35:42,970 --> 02:35:45,980
And how much damage did his brain taking
that?

3541
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:47,930
I mean,
that is a significant mgd,

3542
02:35:47,931 --> 02:35:52,290
but in his career,
not only,

3543
02:35:52,370 --> 02:35:54,430
uh,
Jordan men against him.

3544
02:35:54,431 --> 02:35:59,431
One amazing thing that just hit that.
Who was going on?

3545
02:36:02,670 --> 02:36:04,030
Oh,
crazy.

3546
02:36:04,031 --> 02:36:05,280
How many.
Like you say,

3547
02:36:05,300 --> 02:36:07,900
if what to seed Nogueira at his prime 
and UFC.

3548
02:36:08,060 --> 02:36:11,690
How many wars did old go annual jury go 
through it.

3549
02:36:11,691 --> 02:36:15,410
But how many shots did they take?
Like full fighter in the garden and Lego

3550
02:36:15,460 --> 02:36:20,460
men don't do too many fighters in.
Probably borrowed the.

3551
02:36:20,570 --> 02:36:21,580
Again,
what we talked about,

3552
02:36:21,581 --> 02:36:26,581
the stomps,
the other Gary Goodrich right now is 

3553
02:36:26,581 --> 02:36:26,581
coming out.

3554
02:36:27,070 --> 02:36:29,230
It's so sad to see you because the guy 
was.

3555
02:36:29,260 --> 02:36:32,970
It was amazing.
I just saw the was some,

3556
02:36:33,250 --> 02:36:34,920
I don't know if it was just one of those
sports.

3557
02:36:34,921 --> 02:36:39,921
A news magazine shows the with the NFL 
and stuff that they had 99 samples of 

3558
02:36:41,440 --> 02:36:44,010
former football player's brains were 
dedicated.

3559
02:36:44,860 --> 02:36:48,850
Out of those,
almost 100 percent showed signs of cte.

3560
02:36:48,910 --> 02:36:50,680
Yeah.
I can't imagine you get away without it.

3561
02:36:50,710 --> 02:36:51,430
I mean,
it's just,

3562
02:36:51,460 --> 02:36:53,500
you're colliding into each other.
It's terrible.

3563
02:36:53,950 --> 02:36:55,330
There's no,
there's no way around it.

3564
02:36:55,331 --> 02:36:56,020
Nope.
You know,

3565
02:36:56,021 --> 02:36:56,780
and if you're,
you know,

3566
02:36:56,890 --> 02:37:01,610
Gary Goodrich said that is really his k 
one career that did a man may fights the

3567
02:37:01,630 --> 02:37:03,640
gatekeeper.
They're all show you much,

3568
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:09,000
but hey,
knocked out tito all the way in the 

3569
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,560
beginning.
We were talking about it at the pride 

3570
02:37:11,560 --> 02:37:11,560
fighting championships when he came over
there.

3571
02:37:11,560 --> 02:37:12,340
He was a powerful guy,
man.

3572
02:37:12,400 --> 02:37:15,610
He'll,
you remember what dodd frank and hope,

3573
02:37:15,620 --> 02:37:17,460
a speedy recovery.
The Dawn.

3574
02:37:18,450 --> 02:37:20,560
Actually I just texted him yesterday.
Yeah,

3575
02:37:20,561 --> 02:37:25,561
I remember when he came back to a pride,
the New Year's eve shown goodridge 

3576
02:37:25,561 --> 02:37:27,540
knocked out right away to the rivalry.
But yeah,

3577
02:37:27,541 --> 02:37:29,870
goodrich was a beast back in the day as 
well.

3578
02:37:29,871 --> 02:37:30,860
What happened?
He,

3579
02:37:30,950 --> 02:37:33,800
he beat Gary Young,
UFC,

3580
02:37:35,350 --> 02:37:36,940
UFC of course.
And then in the pride,

3581
02:37:36,950 --> 02:37:38,000
the rematch was,
uh,

3582
02:37:38,200 --> 02:37:40,250
uh,
years later in pride on New Year's Eve.

3583
02:37:40,430 --> 02:37:42,950
And it was like one kick,
Gary.

3584
02:37:42,951 --> 02:37:44,880
Now was it kickboxer,
you know,

3585
02:37:44,930 --> 02:37:46,600
he started training again.
Oh,

3586
02:37:46,610 --> 02:37:48,980
that's right.
Yeah,

3587
02:37:49,480 --> 02:37:50,710
that's right.
I forgot them.

3588
02:37:50,711 --> 02:37:54,740
I member Friday yama courses,
the plastic so much.

3589
02:37:54,741 --> 02:37:57,470
And I felt it immediately forgot about 
Friday.

3590
02:37:58,370 --> 02:38:01,990
And then I've added it to goodwill 
started.

3591
02:38:03,420 --> 02:38:05,930
What about Swanson?
And look how many.

3592
02:38:05,990 --> 02:38:10,990
I mean,
I'm an amazing tool to account many 

3593
02:38:10,990 --> 02:38:11,750
shots.
That was a crazy fight.

3594
02:38:11,751 --> 02:38:14,750
That was the one of the most chaotic 
fights I've ever watched.

3595
02:38:14,750 --> 02:38:19,750
And one of the most,
like the data wasn't going in my head 

3596
02:38:19,750 --> 02:38:19,750
correctly.
I was like,

3597
02:38:19,750 --> 02:38:24,080
how is he getting hit with these 
haymakers that cubs Swanson's winging in

3598
02:38:24,081 --> 02:38:28,580
from downtown Cleveland and cracking him
on his head when he came from across the

3599
02:38:28,960 --> 02:38:31,630
country,
punches crazy,

3600
02:38:35,920 --> 02:38:38,440
just stagger back and then come crack 
him again.

3601
02:38:38,450 --> 02:38:43,450
He would stagger back room a room.
Everybody's standing there watching it.

3602
02:38:43,881 --> 02:38:47,570
It was insane.
Picked it as the.

3603
02:38:48,230 --> 02:38:49,500
There's so many.
That's a thick.

3604
02:38:49,570 --> 02:38:54,290
Remember it started with lawler and 
conduct for fights.

3605
02:38:54,380 --> 02:38:58,120
That was a crazy holloway.
You know,

3606
02:38:58,130 --> 02:39:01,950
when you draw the line and then they 
started slugging it out.

3607
02:39:04,400 --> 02:39:07,310
One of my favorite guys to man,
I went up on this,

3608
02:39:07,940 --> 02:39:12,940
that's going to mcgregor too.
Like he's 100 percent convinced he's 

3609
02:39:12,940 --> 02:39:12,940
going to get a title,
you know,

3610
02:39:12,940 --> 02:39:14,320
he's one of these guys that there's 
nobody's going to know.

3611
02:39:14,510 --> 02:39:19,510
But we went the distance with connor,
but I mean connor did kind of being 

3612
02:39:19,780 --> 02:39:24,780
blown out of the.
That's right towards later he said that 

3613
02:39:24,780 --> 02:39:25,990
he was also injured.
Oh,

3614
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:27,500
Max was.
I believe it.

3615
02:39:27,980 --> 02:39:29,330
You know,
max is a real.

3616
02:39:29,360 --> 02:39:31,040
I mean,
he's an interim champion right now,

3617
02:39:31,041 --> 02:39:32,800
but he's world championship caliber.
Oh yeah.

3618
02:39:32,960 --> 02:39:35,000
Want to see how he does against all 
though.

3619
02:39:35,001 --> 02:39:36,120
I want to see how he does.
Again,

3620
02:39:36,121 --> 02:39:38,360
some of the best guys,
but know he's finished cups wants.

3621
02:39:38,361 --> 02:39:41,470
And should we get rid of interim titles 
through and through boxing,

3622
02:39:41,480 --> 02:39:42,830
mma all to shit.
Uh,

3623
02:39:42,831 --> 02:39:47,831
I think the only way that interim titles
make any sense if someone is recovering 

3624
02:39:47,831 --> 02:39:49,580
from a catastrophic catastrophic injury.

3625
02:39:49,610 --> 02:39:54,610
Yeah.
Like someone blows her acl out and you 

3626
02:39:54,610 --> 02:39:54,610
go,
okay,

3627
02:39:54,610 --> 02:39:54,770
well the title is now going to be 
suspended for a whole year.

3628
02:39:54,830 --> 02:39:59,830
Yup.
Because it's gonna take six months 

3629
02:39:59,830 --> 02:40:01,721
before you can even start training again
and then like nine months we can start 

3630
02:40:01,721 --> 02:40:05,591
training hard and then three months to 
go through a camp you need and then 

3631
02:40:05,591 --> 02:40:09,770
you've got crews took even longer or,
or do you simply say,

3632
02:40:11,151 --> 02:40:13,500
listen,
the title is going to be taken away from

3633
02:40:13,501 --> 02:40:14,880
you,
you know,

3634
02:40:14,960 --> 02:40:19,960
you,
you're not the champion anymore but you 

3635
02:40:19,960 --> 02:40:19,960
are the first one in line as soon as she
come back.

3636
02:40:19,960 --> 02:40:21,060
And that's usually the case a lot of the
time.

3637
02:40:21,061 --> 02:40:23,070
Right.
When they do recover they do get the.

3638
02:40:23,160 --> 02:40:28,160
But I just think the think.
So I think that's an easy because then 

3639
02:40:28,160 --> 02:40:28,650
they lose that history books,
right?

3640
02:40:28,651 --> 02:40:29,710
Yeah,
that's true.

3641
02:40:29,750 --> 02:40:32,760
Makes Sense.
Someone's got a bad injury and you know,

3642
02:40:32,761 --> 02:40:36,360
like Anderson Silva made sense with the 
owner to take it away.

3643
02:40:36,360 --> 02:40:37,230
And uh,
I mean,

3644
02:40:37,231 --> 02:40:39,030
I know if he wasn't going to defend it,
but we know,

3645
02:40:39,031 --> 02:40:40,320
I mean they,
they needed to.

3646
02:40:40,830 --> 02:40:45,830
Again,
I don't think the UFC is the one just 

3647
02:40:45,830 --> 02:40:48,770
down the hallway when they took it away 
from title.

3648
02:40:48,930 --> 02:40:49,550
Well,
I know,

3649
02:40:49,590 --> 02:40:51,920
but it's not defending the title.
You guys take it away from him.

3650
02:40:53,420 --> 02:40:57,550
If all those already the champion,
then the winter of Holloway and walk,

3651
02:40:57,950 --> 02:41:02,950
they become the number one contender.
Then the problem is you tie up the 

3652
02:41:02,950 --> 02:41:05,670
titles.
You got a guy who's the champion champ,

3653
02:41:05,671 --> 02:41:08,460
champ.
Like connor champ at 45 and 55.

3654
02:41:08,790 --> 02:41:13,790
You got to say you got to vacate one 
because it's like to hold two of them 

3655
02:41:13,790 --> 02:41:14,910
subsequently or then they should've done
it right then and there.

3656
02:41:14,911 --> 02:41:16,350
He made history.
Thank you very much.

3657
02:41:16,390 --> 02:41:18,430
Was the one title Let.
I'm not going to defend all.

3658
02:41:18,431 --> 02:41:19,320
He's got to decide.

3659
02:41:19,590 --> 02:41:24,590
You know,
he decided he's going to stay at 55 

3660
02:41:24,590 --> 02:41:24,590
where they decided not to know what the 
fuck's going on,

3661
02:41:24,670 --> 02:41:26,600
but I don't think he can get for what if
45.

3662
02:41:26,601 --> 02:41:27,460
It's going to be hard for.
Let's see.

3663
02:41:27,490 --> 02:41:28,530
There's another way.
Cut that.

3664
02:41:28,531 --> 02:41:31,680
You're right.
I don't think we should be at 1:45.

3665
02:41:31,681 --> 02:41:34,300
Doesn't look like a man when you see me 
at 1:45

3666
02:41:34,560 --> 02:41:37,920
or two to cut in in depth.
It's terrible.

3667
02:41:38,250 --> 02:41:41,550
You can only do that so many times.
Much healthier at 1:55

3668
02:41:41,850 --> 02:41:44,780
and there's a bunch of fights for him.
But then when they were talking about.

3669
02:41:44,781 --> 02:41:45,140
No,
no,

3670
02:41:45,210 --> 02:41:47,720
no med off fighting.
Turning Tony Ferguson guys.

3671
02:41:47,760 --> 02:41:49,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

3672
02:41:49,081 --> 02:41:50,720
Look at that fucking picture on the 
left.

3673
02:41:50,730 --> 02:41:55,730
He looks he looks like a taxi cab.
Yeah.

3674
02:41:57,180 --> 02:41:58,260
Much,
much healthier.

3675
02:41:58,261 --> 02:41:59,850
Right.
So I think that,

3676
02:41:59,880 --> 02:42:02,190
you know,
if they were talking about having,

3677
02:42:02,191 --> 02:42:05,340
although and normally when madoff fight 
for an interim,

3678
02:42:05,341 --> 02:42:09,000
1:55
title or Ferguson was 45,

3679
02:42:09,001 --> 02:42:09,730
I think that's.

3680
02:42:09,780 --> 02:42:13,350
Well 45 is now,
although all those a champ,

3681
02:42:13,351 --> 02:42:14,850
right?
Max Hall was the interim champ.

3682
02:42:14,910 --> 02:42:18,240
Those guys have 100 percent,
100 percent.

3683
02:42:18,510 --> 02:42:20,790
But now all the.
I mean I don't know if it's true,

3684
02:42:20,791 --> 02:42:22,890
but in a normal going out.
So it was bullshit.

3685
02:42:23,180 --> 02:42:28,180
They were talking about Aldo fighting a 
super fight with Russia and of course 

3686
02:42:28,180 --> 02:42:29,220
Tony Ferguson's like what?
Well,

3687
02:42:29,221 --> 02:42:34,221
Tony Ferguson wanted more money than 
this contract stated and unfortunately 

3688
02:42:34,221 --> 02:42:37,941
for him,
he's in a weird position right now 

3689
02:42:37,941 --> 02:42:39,711
because there's so many fights to be 
made at 55 and the big one of course is 

3690
02:42:39,711 --> 02:42:39,711
connor.
Sure.

3691
02:42:39,711 --> 02:42:44,420
Anybody who conor fights,
if it decides to fight conor and they 

3692
02:42:44,420 --> 02:42:46,090
decided that's the big fight and they 
put her on in Russia anywhere,

3693
02:42:46,320 --> 02:42:51,320
but for sure fucking low.
I Irish guys in the Russian guys,

3694
02:42:53,010 --> 02:42:55,890
they do realize just how big he is in 
Russia,

3695
02:42:55,920 --> 02:42:57,000
number combined off giant.

3696
02:42:57,060 --> 02:43:00,330
He's a huge star when he,
when he goes on stage too,

3697
02:43:00,331 --> 02:43:02,810
like when he steps onto the platform and
enters into the cage,

3698
02:43:02,880 --> 02:43:05,080
fucking crowd goes nuts.
They know who he is.

3699
02:43:05,580 --> 02:43:10,580
It's just one of those things where the 
Russians are way ahead of the game in 

3700
02:43:10,580 --> 02:43:12,220
terms of knowing who he is.
He's a giant star over there,

3701
02:43:12,221 --> 02:43:14,590
but he could be a giant star over here 
to kids,

3702
02:43:14,780 --> 02:43:18,030
kids of color on the walls.
People and if funny guy to you know,

3703
02:43:18,040 --> 02:43:21,250
outside of five has got personality.
I like him.

3704
02:43:21,640 --> 02:43:22,630
He's,
you know,

3705
02:43:23,050 --> 02:43:28,050
he's a real wild card in that division 
because he's undefeated mean we saw one 

3706
02:43:28,301 --> 02:43:30,340
moment of weakness.
That's it.

3707
02:43:30,580 --> 02:43:33,250
One moment was in trouble and he came 
back from that brilliantly.

3708
02:43:33,370 --> 02:43:35,560
Cain Velasquez again.
Yeah,

3709
02:43:35,561 --> 02:43:36,770
he's gonna fight again.
But you know,

3710
02:43:36,790 --> 02:43:38,770
he's got some serious fucking medical 
problems.

3711
02:43:39,250 --> 02:43:41,590
He's got a stenosis,
spinal stenosis,

3712
02:43:41,620 --> 02:43:41,950
which is.

3713
02:43:41,960 --> 02:43:45,560
They have to clean out his area.
Whereas spine.

3714
02:43:45,580 --> 02:43:48,580
So what would you fight again?
Because he's got.

3715
02:43:48,760 --> 02:43:52,260
He's got a dream.
You say medically like that.

3716
02:43:52,270 --> 02:43:53,160
If it's better,
you don't.

3717
02:43:53,980 --> 02:43:58,980
Well apparently the doctors are very 
convinced that they can open up that 

3718
02:43:58,980 --> 02:44:02,821
pathway a little bit and whatever is 
pressing down on the bone spurs or 

3719
02:44:02,821 --> 02:44:03,370
anything that are pressing down the 
nerve,

3720
02:44:03,371 --> 02:44:05,500
they can remove those and that'll 
alleviate as issues.

3721
02:44:06,280 --> 02:44:07,960
I don't know that I'm not a doctor.
I don't know.

3722
02:44:08,500 --> 02:44:09,130
Poor guy,
man.

3723
02:44:09,220 --> 02:44:14,220
He fucked up that he had a.
He had surgery exactly before the fight.

3724
02:44:15,190 --> 02:44:17,440
That was a big mistake was because you 
put,

3725
02:44:17,510 --> 02:44:22,510
you know,
Bob Bennett and the Nevada state 

3726
02:44:22,510 --> 02:44:24,380
commission in a terrible position 
because you're saying that you're 

3727
02:44:24,380 --> 02:44:26,570
compromised and so then they ran some 
tests on him and I guess his doctor 

3728
02:44:26,570 --> 02:44:27,910
cleared him,
but the Nevada state athletic commission

3729
02:44:27,911 --> 02:44:28,420
was like,
look,

3730
02:44:28,430 --> 02:44:29,970
you're going to have to have a cortisone
shot,

3731
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:33,190
numb everything up,
and even though you might have some,

3732
02:44:33,880 --> 02:44:38,880
you know,
you don't have really a problem as far 

3733
02:44:38,880 --> 02:44:38,920
as the structure of your back.
You might be compromised.

3734
02:44:39,340 --> 02:44:40,330
Something like,
can't do it.

3735
02:44:41,050 --> 02:44:42,970
Go get the surgery.
What about that French?

3736
02:44:42,971 --> 02:44:46,210
A heavyweight.
And God knew who he was.

3737
02:44:46,230 --> 02:44:50,420
Yeah.
He figured it out when you were talking.

3738
02:44:51,400 --> 02:44:52,690
I was thinking about him.
I'm like,

3739
02:44:52,691 --> 02:44:53,840
wow,
that guy is a.

3740
02:44:53,920 --> 02:44:55,600
he's terrifying monster men.
Yeah.

3741
02:44:55,760 --> 02:45:00,760
And you know,
it can punch so fucking hard and he 

3742
02:45:00,760 --> 02:45:03,781
kicks so hard to.
And he gets into the octagon to certain 

3743
02:45:03,781 --> 02:45:03,781
dudes.
They walk into the octagon.

3744
02:45:03,781 --> 02:45:07,870
They sound different like fee.

3745
02:45:10,930 --> 02:45:15,930
They're just bigger man.
Gonzaga was Zaga would step on the 

3746
02:45:15,930 --> 02:45:16,810
platform to weigh in and you just feel 
like Jesus,

3747
02:45:17,620 --> 02:45:20,530
he's made of stone and it was just 
heavier.

3748
02:45:21,070 --> 02:45:26,070
I love those elbows.
You remember that he threw so over the 

3749
02:45:26,070 --> 02:45:28,501
top.
Through the defense on the ground when 

3750
02:45:28,501 --> 02:45:28,501
he was in the garden.
Yeah.

3751
02:45:28,501 --> 02:45:28,501
Well it was blue.
Sweet revenge.

3752
02:45:28,501 --> 02:45:31,650
When Marco came back,
smashed him with elbows from the top and

3753
02:45:31,720 --> 02:45:35,410
they're crazy.
That fight.

3754
02:45:35,440 --> 02:45:40,440
Mirko was saying that one of the things 
he doesn't like about the UFC vs pride 

3755
02:45:40,440 --> 02:45:42,280
was the,
that there's too much grappling and that

3756
02:45:42,281 --> 02:45:44,440
there's too many elbows on the ground.
What won them?

3757
02:45:44,441 --> 02:45:46,720
The fight.
Grappling and elbows on the ground.

3758
02:45:46,820 --> 02:45:48,010
Yeah,
fucking crazy.

3759
02:45:48,640 --> 02:45:53,640
He was worried that Zach was just trying
to take him down and that he wasn't 

3760
02:45:53,640 --> 02:45:56,130
gonna stand with them so he couldn't get
his revenge from the head kick knockout,

3761
02:45:56,140 --> 02:46:01,140
but he got while he takes Gonzaga down,
he's on top and he smashes him with 

3762
02:46:01,140 --> 02:46:02,290
Elvis.
It's unbelievable,

3763
02:46:02,291 --> 02:46:07,291
man.
Learn learning game while he realized 

3764
02:46:07,291 --> 02:46:11,080
that it also,
when you've got a guy who that level 

3765
02:46:11,080 --> 02:46:11,080
striker,
like Arco is

3766
02:46:11,080 --> 02:46:15,040
throwing elbows from the guard.
You see how much force you can generate 

3767
02:46:15,040 --> 02:46:16,200
where he's retired again after winning 
the rise and things.

3768
02:46:17,420 --> 02:46:20,390
What a great way.
Great way to go out on an epic Korea.

3769
02:46:21,560 --> 02:46:23,420
One of the all time.
Of course,

3770
02:46:23,421 --> 02:46:26,490
the whole of the prank you pull,
but I mean the fight will fade or just.

3771
02:46:26,780 --> 02:46:27,980
He was one of the.
For me,

3772
02:46:27,981 --> 02:46:30,830
the guy right away when you were around 
him was like,

3773
02:46:30,831 --> 02:46:35,831
Holy Shit,
I'll never forget his stare down with 

3774
02:46:35,831 --> 02:46:36,410
vandelay for that first fight.
My first fight.

3775
02:46:36,411 --> 02:46:40,140
Someone for someone finally out stared 
vandelay.

3776
02:46:40,730 --> 02:46:41,880
No,
he was another fruit.

3777
02:46:42,230 --> 02:46:46,610
No fucking straight up killer can write 
into your soul.

3778
02:46:47,420 --> 02:46:52,420
Yeah.
Ready to cut your heart out for the 

3779
02:46:52,420 --> 02:46:52,420
fucking butter knife.
That was no joke,

3780
02:46:52,420 --> 02:46:57,371
man.
That that's why it was so easy to set 

3781
02:46:57,371 --> 02:46:58,160
him up because America didn't want to 
interview by anybody.

3782
02:46:58,170 --> 02:47:01,340
He wanted me to interview him and nobody
else could interview him,

3783
02:47:01,341 --> 02:47:06,341
so that whole respect to state.
He never showed foot a whole press 

3784
02:47:06,341 --> 02:47:10,310
conferences.
He hated the media media just because.

3785
02:47:10,311 --> 02:47:12,920
Well there were a member of the 
translation.

3786
02:47:12,921 --> 02:47:17,921
He,
I guess there was an interview right 

3787
02:47:17,921 --> 02:47:17,921
with our member.
There was an interview where I guess the

3788
02:47:17,921 --> 02:47:22,181
pride people were translating a wrong 
and he came across these like a few 

3789
02:47:22,181 --> 02:47:23,040
guys.
So your boss had a kitchen.

3790
02:47:23,390 --> 02:47:24,350
But uh,
yeah,

3791
02:47:24,351 --> 02:47:26,750
I was very intimidated.
My man and uh,

3792
02:47:27,160 --> 02:47:29,190
he got me good.
But he a wow.

3793
02:47:29,191 --> 02:47:31,700
But it showed a personality too because 
that was the time where it.

3794
02:47:31,740 --> 02:47:36,740
So when he came he became your buddy.
I don't know what the fuck you're 

3795
02:47:36,861 --> 02:47:39,470
talking about.
He played a prank on morrow.

3796
02:47:39,590 --> 02:47:40,810
Okay,
well the,

3797
02:47:40,830 --> 02:47:41,120
the,
the,

3798
02:47:41,121 --> 02:47:42,290
the,
the prank was this,

3799
02:47:42,420 --> 02:47:47,420
uh,
he was facing miracle quote was facing 

3800
02:47:47,420 --> 02:47:47,420
Ron Waterman.

3801
02:47:47,420 --> 02:47:47,780
Now the way we set it up like two days 
before the fight,

3802
02:47:47,990 --> 02:47:50,260
we both interviewed with fighter.
He fought interviews,

3803
02:47:50,270 --> 02:47:55,270
waterman.
I interviewed because she never wanted 

3804
02:47:55,270 --> 02:47:56,060
to do anything with kroger.
He was afraid of kroger upset.

3805
02:47:56,061 --> 02:47:59,780
He wasn't one to be interviewed by me.
So I'm already before this,

3806
02:47:59,781 --> 02:48:00,620
I'm thinking,
okay,

3807
02:48:00,621 --> 02:48:02,600
I gotta do some shit.
I went to Croak up and I said,

3808
02:48:02,601 --> 02:48:05,060
listen,
I'm going to interview Waterman.

3809
02:48:05,120 --> 02:48:06,790
And then it's like,
oh no,

3810
02:48:07,310 --> 02:48:07,800
hell no.
Mom.

3811
02:48:07,801 --> 02:48:09,950
But you're going to have to interview a 
miracle.

3812
02:48:10,310 --> 02:48:11,390
Are you okay with that?
He said sure.

3813
02:48:11,391 --> 02:48:12,770
So He.
Because he thought it was funny.

3814
02:48:13,160 --> 02:48:18,160
So one of them comes in.
I started interviewing him and sure 

3815
02:48:18,160 --> 02:48:18,160
enough when he left,
I look at Morrow,

3816
02:48:18,160 --> 02:48:18,860
I go,
oh dude,

3817
02:48:18,861 --> 02:48:19,910
I'm so sorry.
And he goes,

3818
02:48:19,911 --> 02:48:20,990
what?
I said,

3819
02:48:20,991 --> 02:48:23,060
I interviewed a waterman.
So I said,

3820
02:48:23,061 --> 02:48:24,460
well,
you're going to have to do an interview.

3821
02:48:25,130 --> 02:48:25,760
He goes,
no man,

3822
02:48:25,761 --> 02:48:26,930
I don't want to interview America.
You know,

3823
02:48:26,931 --> 02:48:31,931
it's just a miracle.
I never wanted to go to these 

3824
02:48:31,931 --> 02:48:31,940
interviews.
He wants to be interviewed on the day of

3825
02:48:31,940 --> 02:48:36,940
the event in his dressing room.
So we go to the dressing room with him 

3826
02:48:36,940 --> 02:48:40,871
and he starts and a miracle is now all 
in on it and at this moment.

3827
02:48:41,600 --> 02:48:42,500
And he starts telling you,
hey,

3828
02:48:42,501 --> 02:48:43,530
you know,
want in Waterman?

3829
02:48:43,540 --> 02:48:47,570
He said something about a funeral and 
miracle,

3830
02:48:47,571 --> 02:48:50,000
his thinking.
He said he'd come back and he says,

3831
02:48:50,180 --> 02:48:55,180
a funeral list.
When somebody passes away and America 

3832
02:48:55,180 --> 02:48:55,180
goes,
I know what a funeral this.

3833
02:48:55,180 --> 02:48:59,730
So it starts like that.
And slowly but surely and Sunday miraco 

3834
02:48:59,730 --> 02:48:59,730
stops and he says,
you know,

3835
02:48:59,730 --> 02:49:01,940
I didn't in my life the way you were 
commentating on my fight the last time.

3836
02:49:02,180 --> 02:49:03,980
And it wasn't him compensated with 
somebody else.

3837
02:49:03,981 --> 02:49:04,470
So he goes,
no,

3838
02:49:04,471 --> 02:49:05,050
no,
it wasn't me.

3839
02:49:05,060 --> 02:49:05,330
No,
no,

3840
02:49:05,360 --> 02:49:10,360
it was you.
They looked at his corner and the 

3841
02:49:10,360 --> 02:49:10,360
quarter to go shoot.

3842
02:49:10,360 --> 02:49:12,240
And he's looking at me tomorrow.
Looks at me like a little help,

3843
02:49:12,241 --> 02:49:13,550
a little help.
But I'm just looking away,

3844
02:49:13,590 --> 02:49:15,120
you know,
I'm not saying anything.

3845
02:49:15,330 --> 02:49:15,990
And then yeah,
no,

3846
02:49:15,991 --> 02:49:18,030
I really didn't expect no,
but I really wasn't doing it.

3847
02:49:18,031 --> 02:49:19,800
But give it back.
Go back to the question.

3848
02:49:19,801 --> 02:49:21,750
So we stopped.
But now miracle start getting annoyed,

3849
02:49:22,110 --> 02:49:27,110
you know,
and he doesn't want to ask questions 

3850
02:49:27,110 --> 02:49:27,110
anymore.
He says,

3851
02:49:27,110 --> 02:49:27,110
do it,
this guy segment,

3852
02:49:27,110 --> 02:49:27,110
he doesn't like me,
I don't want to scare.

3853
02:49:27,110 --> 02:49:29,280
So he gets out that we send him back.
And we said,

3854
02:49:29,281 --> 02:49:29,510
no,
no,

3855
02:49:29,520 --> 02:49:31,530
you've got to have to ask him a few more
questions.

3856
02:49:31,531 --> 02:49:36,531
So we know he's going back and he sits 
down again and he starts going and 

3857
02:49:36,541 --> 02:49:37,850
miracles.
Suddenly vehicle gets up,

3858
02:49:37,870 --> 02:49:38,460
says,
you know what,

3859
02:49:38,600 --> 02:49:43,600
this is it,
and he walked straight up tomorrow and 

3860
02:49:43,600 --> 02:49:43,600
Morris stop pissing his pants.

3861
02:49:43,600 --> 02:49:47,590
Of course things are.
This is over and moral comes out and 

3862
02:49:47,590 --> 02:49:47,590
says,
no,

3863
02:49:47,590 --> 02:49:47,590
no.
Okay.

3864
02:49:47,590 --> 02:49:48,720
I don't want to.
Do you need one more question?

3865
02:49:48,721 --> 02:49:53,721
We need one more question because no,
I don't want to like a few guys.

3866
02:49:54,610 --> 02:49:55,850
And I go,
Oh,

3867
02:49:55,860 --> 02:49:57,960
a miracle cream out of the dressing 
room.

3868
02:49:58,140 --> 02:50:00,040
And he started walking straight up to 
Norway.

3869
02:50:00,170 --> 02:50:01,910
Morris,
you seem shrinking.

3870
02:50:02,510 --> 02:50:04,680
And he goes,
do it is all just a joke.

3871
02:50:05,010 --> 02:50:10,010
It was a miracle coming down.
He's gonna fucking left.

3872
02:50:11,521 --> 02:50:13,200
Kicked my head off,
my career's done.

3873
02:50:13,201 --> 02:50:14,430
I'm finished.
And then he,

3874
02:50:14,431 --> 02:50:15,440
he was in on it,
buddy.

3875
02:50:15,450 --> 02:50:16,200
Yeah,
you guys.

3876
02:50:16,201 --> 02:50:21,201
It was a terrifying.
Well that was when he was ahead of the 

3877
02:50:21,201 --> 02:50:24,051
antiterrorist Croatia shit.
Yeah.

3878
02:50:25,210 --> 02:50:25,840
No,
he did.

3879
02:50:26,180 --> 02:50:28,880
He had some hits,
some little notches on his life,

3880
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:34,000
like big Rambo next.
It was some real shit.

3881
02:50:35,800 --> 02:50:40,800
You never want it to.
You never came to the press conferences 

3882
02:50:40,800 --> 02:50:40,800
showed up to fight and got the hell out 
of dodge.

3883
02:50:40,800 --> 02:50:45,200
Well,
he was one of the first real high level 

3884
02:50:45,200 --> 02:50:45,570
kickboxers to enter into Brian.
Once he learned how to sprawl,

3885
02:50:45,780 --> 02:50:50,780
started lightened up like champion.
Remember that knocked out fate or his 

3886
02:50:50,780 --> 02:50:54,711
brother vandelay.
The open way to Grand Prix was heavier 

3887
02:50:58,801 --> 02:51:03,620
than vandelay,
was to 18 to 14 federal aid.

3888
02:51:03,720 --> 02:51:07,200
Mark Hunt with randy couture,
a commentary.

3889
02:51:07,350 --> 02:51:12,350
There's a small country over his right 
eye or put the atomic weight.

3890
02:51:18,180 --> 02:51:20,550
A lot of people thought that that fight 
kind of ruined.

3891
02:51:20,551 --> 02:51:25,551
Vandelay hunt cracked him a couple of 
times and I'm stunned in that fight and 

3892
02:51:25,551 --> 02:51:27,750
that was one of one of vandelays last 
fights in his prime,

3893
02:51:27,751 --> 02:51:29,570
but he's another one man,
right?

3894
02:51:29,610 --> 02:51:32,700
Come money.
Just him and Quinton Rampage Jackson.

3895
02:51:32,730 --> 02:51:37,730
How about that for a dramatic Kao,
a Halloween I probably 28 when Jackson 

3896
02:51:37,730 --> 02:51:40,920
did very well in the rematch and then go
vandelay catches them again.

3897
02:51:40,930 --> 02:51:43,720
The nice in between the ropes and he 
went,

3898
02:51:44,730 --> 02:51:46,510
holy crap.
That was a bad knockout.

3899
02:51:47,200 --> 02:51:52,200
He smashes,
knows what's going on with Randall 

3900
02:51:52,200 --> 02:51:52,200
Randall,
who's going to fight and rise.

3901
02:51:52,200 --> 02:51:54,330
And I heard what he was supposed to 
fight,

3902
02:51:54,331 --> 02:51:57,300
bug Miraco in the rising thing and he 
didn't.

3903
02:51:57,390 --> 02:51:59,430
He pulled out.
He had an injury or something.

3904
02:51:59,740 --> 02:52:04,740
I don't know.
You were hanging out with Bellatore and 

3905
02:52:04,740 --> 02:52:04,740
another one.
Man,

3906
02:52:04,740 --> 02:52:05,040
I can't fight anymore,
man.

3907
02:52:05,390 --> 02:52:08,500
I'm not the one that say by any means.
But what's the point?

3908
02:52:08,580 --> 02:52:10,240
Definitely can fight camp.
Fight.

3909
02:52:10,241 --> 02:52:11,440
Yeah.
But not his.

3910
02:52:11,441 --> 02:52:15,020
He's his health is good.
I mean that's it in a long time now too.

3911
02:52:15,430 --> 02:52:18,160
You've got to think like this is a long 
time off.

3912
02:52:18,230 --> 02:52:20,200
Yeah.
I remember once he told us in pride,

3913
02:52:20,201 --> 02:52:21,130
he dog.
I go,

3914
02:52:21,131 --> 02:52:21,880
how long,
you know,

3915
02:52:22,390 --> 02:52:24,010
typical question.
How much longer you want to do?

3916
02:52:24,250 --> 02:52:26,110
Well,
randy couture did it until he was 48,

3917
02:52:26,111 --> 02:52:28,150
so I'm going to do it until I'm 50.
Well,

3918
02:52:28,280 --> 02:52:30,820
what do you guys think about what 
happened with vandelay?

3919
02:52:31,090 --> 02:52:34,300
Because with vandelay they came to him,
saw came to him,

3920
02:52:34,301 --> 02:52:36,780
they tried to test him and he's like,
I'm Outta here.

3921
02:52:36,781 --> 02:52:40,500
You fucking brain did the same thing.
Remember?

3922
02:52:40,810 --> 02:52:42,630
He flew back to Holland.
Yep.

3923
02:52:42,850 --> 02:52:45,540
When was this member?
He was a war against me.

3924
02:52:45,541 --> 02:52:50,541
Or was it.
Or what the fight was supposed to be 

3925
02:52:50,541 --> 02:52:52,081
where he was the same thing,
kind of got out of dodge when testing 

3926
02:52:52,081 --> 02:52:52,081
was looking for him.
But vandelay same.

3927
02:52:52,081 --> 02:52:53,590
Yeah.
I didn't know about the house.

3928
02:52:53,610 --> 02:52:55,260
What it is.
Yeah.

3929
02:52:55,670 --> 02:53:00,670
He uh,
what was the first alice stroke first 

3930
02:53:00,670 --> 02:53:01,030
they went to.
Same thing,

3931
02:53:01,620 --> 02:53:03,520
but he tried to say,
well,

3932
02:53:03,521 --> 02:53:06,500
I didn't know that you guys were a 
sprints away from drugs.

3933
02:53:08,610 --> 02:53:10,350
Okay.
So this is 2012.

3934
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:14,770
That was back when it was a real,
like a real.

3935
02:53:14,980 --> 02:53:17,200
This is really rare that you will get 
caught.

3936
02:53:17,370 --> 02:53:18,220
Ya,
Ya see,

3937
02:53:18,270 --> 02:53:20,080
break the mirror right there.
So yeah,

3938
02:53:20,140 --> 02:53:24,190
I mean it's done right.
It's definitely not gun.

3939
02:53:24,250 --> 02:53:27,000
I'm guilty.
I'm guilty.

3940
02:53:27,400 --> 02:53:28,140
Yup.
Yeah.

3941
02:53:28,420 --> 02:53:30,310
But it just seems like to me,
they railroaded him.

3942
02:53:30,340 --> 02:53:35,340
I mean,
you can't just take the guy's career 

3943
02:53:35,340 --> 02:53:35,340
away,
you know,

3944
02:53:35,340 --> 02:53:36,380
if you tested him and he was positive,
that's whatever punishment he,

3945
02:53:36,800 --> 02:53:39,040
if he runs away from the test,
just stays positive.

3946
02:53:39,340 --> 02:53:40,930
And then he would have already been 
fighting again.

3947
02:53:40,960 --> 02:53:41,600
Yeah.
You know.

3948
02:53:41,650 --> 02:53:44,650
But instead they tried to sustain that 
forever.

3949
02:53:44,651 --> 02:53:46,270
Forever.
Forever for life.

3950
02:53:46,510 --> 02:53:49,420
So he got that overturned,
but now he's still battling out in court

3951
02:53:49,421 --> 02:53:53,050
who knows how much it cost him in court,
but didn't do himself any favors.

3952
02:53:53,051 --> 02:53:54,470
But with this interview,
you know,

3953
02:53:54,570 --> 02:53:57,660
bashing UFC batch and everybody was 
worse than that.

3954
02:53:57,670 --> 02:53:59,310
I started making youtube videos.
Right.

3955
02:53:59,370 --> 02:54:01,100
Took a mania staring in front of the 
camera.

3956
02:54:04,620 --> 02:54:06,350
Yeah,
yeah,

3957
02:54:07,860 --> 02:54:08,880
yeah.
Yeah.

3958
02:54:08,881 --> 02:54:10,480
It just got crazy.
Yeah.

3959
02:54:10,481 --> 02:54:12,760
I mean it was probably some really dark 
moments for him.

3960
02:54:12,761 --> 02:54:13,330
Oh,
I bet.

3961
02:54:13,630 --> 02:54:14,830
I mean,
where's he make money now?

3962
02:54:14,831 --> 02:54:16,150
Just as Jim,
I guess.

3963
02:54:16,230 --> 02:54:17,150
Right?
Backed.

3964
02:54:17,350 --> 02:54:20,680
I don't even know what was taught as a 
fighter for me.

3965
02:54:20,681 --> 02:54:25,681
It's hard to not do it anymore to.
Oh and especially not train anyway so 

3966
02:54:25,681 --> 02:54:26,230
that she can at least when you can 
train.

3967
02:54:26,640 --> 02:54:28,750
Right.
But did the feeling.

3968
02:54:28,751 --> 02:54:31,160
There's no feeling like it to walk out 
that hey,

3969
02:54:31,161 --> 02:54:32,950
you know,
are you training at all anymore?

3970
02:54:33,040 --> 02:54:35,160
No.
One just water exercise on the water and

3971
02:54:35,161 --> 02:54:40,161
uh,
and sometimes had to do with weights 

3972
02:54:40,161 --> 02:54:40,161
trading.
My just my right arm.

3973
02:54:40,161 --> 02:54:43,321
Pretty much works.
You're going to fight federally and 

3974
02:54:43,321 --> 02:54:45,250
pride with dynamite show.
That was official.

3975
02:54:45,330 --> 02:54:48,280
That was good.
I was facing to fight him to ask me,

3976
02:54:48,281 --> 02:54:53,281
you want to fight,
but identified for a long time and I 

3977
02:54:53,281 --> 02:54:53,281
said,
listen,

3978
02:54:53,281 --> 02:54:53,281
I'd only been striking.

3979
02:54:53,281 --> 02:54:55,930
So since this is a mix between k one and
and pride,

3980
02:54:56,080 --> 02:54:59,560
why don't we do a kickboxing match,
but the gloves,

3981
02:54:59,590 --> 02:55:02,500
I would love to do that and then.
But they didn't go for it.

3982
02:55:02,501 --> 02:55:04,490
He,
he chose another opponent at the time.

3983
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:05,600
So.
But that.

3984
02:55:05,601 --> 02:55:07,820
I think that would have been such a 
change for you.

3985
02:55:07,850 --> 02:55:08,590
What would it be?
Cool.

3986
02:55:08,760 --> 02:55:11,330
That's good money at the time.
That would have been a crazy fight.

3987
02:55:12,410 --> 02:55:17,410
What's holding?
What's holding you back from becoming 

3988
02:55:17,410 --> 02:55:17,410
like pride again?
Superstar.

3989
02:55:17,410 --> 02:55:22,040
A superstar superstar and just they just
need some big Japanese dude to come 

3990
02:55:22,551 --> 02:55:27,551
along.
There's some sacral Robert type 

3991
02:55:27,551 --> 02:55:30,251
character to capture the public's never 
brushed of suck Arab guy,

3992
02:55:30,630 --> 02:55:35,630
man.
I mean he took some horrible mess when 

3993
02:55:35,821 --> 02:55:40,821
he fought Hanzo again and the metamorris
Kelly and frank and I had a chance to 

3994
02:55:40,821 --> 02:55:43,560
visit with them.
Frank was very close to fighting soccer.

3995
02:55:43,560 --> 02:55:45,020
Robin Pride.
They offered a,

3996
02:55:45,230 --> 02:55:46,550
a big contract.
Same thing.

3997
02:55:46,551 --> 02:55:48,380
They couldn't come to an agreement but 
a,

3998
02:55:49,160 --> 02:55:49,610
well,
listen,

3999
02:55:49,611 --> 02:55:54,611
we've got to wrap this up,
but you guys were a duo for some of the 

4000
02:55:54,611 --> 02:55:54,870
greatest fights of all time,
you know,

4001
02:55:54,920 --> 02:55:59,920
and I,
I enjoyed it deeply enjoyed it and I 

4002
02:55:59,920 --> 02:56:02,861
appreciate you guys coming on joining 
this a lot and let everybody know about 

4003

4004

combat sports carousel where we cover 

4005
02:56:09,210 --> 02:56:12,761
mma,
boxing a little wwe and kickboxing as 

4006
02:56:12,761 --> 02:56:13,820
well,
and a boss breaks it down like a Boston.

4007
02:56:13,821 --> 02:56:18,470
Then on Fridays it's just Boston.
