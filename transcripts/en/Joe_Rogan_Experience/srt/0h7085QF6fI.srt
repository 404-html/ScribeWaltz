1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,080
She's saying him there and we go live
and then things are crackling and then

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,060
people are talking and
everybody's listening.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,200
What the fuck?

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:10,640
No,

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,430
no one's Thomas.

6
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:11,941
What the sign?

7
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:12,774
We could just do it.

8
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,053
All right.

9
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,230
So right now we're starting right now.

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,153
That's for a second.

11
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,043
Sorry.

12
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,700
Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by the fleshlight.

13
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,910
And if you go to Joe Rogan duct to net
and click on the link for the flashlight

14
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,900
and then use the codename Rogan,

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,010
you will save yourself 15% off.

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,750
So you will not just shoot your little
loads that you're trying to get rid of.

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,910
You'll save yourself
a little bit of money.

18
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,080
I used mine the other day,

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:43,771
they'd like to remember,

20
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:44,360
I told him,

21
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,450
you said Tim for the podcast.

22
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,370
I just was sitting in my
man cave and I was like,

23
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,630
I didn't want to fuck my flashlight.

24
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,050
Wow.

25
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:49,550
And it just,

26
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,270
I looked at it and it was
just sitting there like,

27
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:52,140
what are you doing?

28
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,181
What are you doing?

29
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:55,014
Like it was

30
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:56,341
like,

31
00:00:56,341 --> 00:00:56,611
you know,

32
00:00:56,611 --> 00:00:57,444
that's the thing,

33
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,090
when you take it on like the
road with you for a weekend,

34
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,200
you feel like it's a whore.

35
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,460
Like when you take it on the road with you

36
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,070
and just fuck it,

37
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:07,680
like a Chechen hoard the
bottom of a coal mine.

38
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,960
That was a great analogy.

39
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,370
It's a,

40
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,740
it's a little too good.

41
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,150
Well,

42
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,870
I don't think women are
very comfortable with it.

43
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:17,130
It's a little too effective.

44
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,840
And by the way,

45
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,860
this is just the beginning.

46
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,341
I mean,

47
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:21,660
technology's going to improve,

48
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:21,871
right?

49
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:24,840
200 years ago we didn't have a
car and now we have a flashlight.

50
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,441
What would it be?

51
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:26,490
The technology of flashlight.

52
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:27,840
Do you think it's a robot fuck doll?

53
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:28,470
Yeah,

54
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,303
for sure.

55
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,780
Something that like acts like
the hottest porn star alive,

56
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:35,940
but only exists to fuck.

57
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:36,741
You know,

58
00:01:36,741 --> 00:01:37,680
like you shut it off,

59
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,650
but when you turn it on it looks
like a person and it wants to fuck.

60
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,071
I mean,

61
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:42,510
it's really creepy to us,

62
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,920
but we have to assume that we are,

63
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:48,930
we're not a perfect being.

64
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:50,370
The human beings not perfect.

65
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:50,521
Right?

66
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:51,510
It's not at all.

67
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,070
It's not done being involved.

68
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,720
It's just a step along the way.

69
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:56,520
Just like monkeys were step along the way.

70
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:58,260
Just like turtles are
a step along the way.

71
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,131
We're this,

72
00:01:59,131 --> 00:02:01,800
this thing is still trying
to advance and improve.

73
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,560
Right.

74
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,090
So you got to accept the fact that
that's a part of the equation.

75
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,390
Part of the equation.

76
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,860
We've got duplicate,

77
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,780
I forgot this analogy was about Jackie.

78
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,220
We're going to duplicate bodies,

79
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,050
we're going to duplicate
them and fuck them.

80
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,230
I need,

81
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:17,471
I need,

82
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:21,750
I just sometimes you don't want all the
extra hassle that comes with dealing

83
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:23,400
with a person.

84
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,450
You know,

85
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,740
just want to be able to get rid of some
loads and if you could have like a fake

86
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:33,000
person like that can even make out
with you and stuff like a fake person.

87
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,390
It's creepy though cause the
idea is like well what is that?

88
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:38,460
This is blade runner
and he's just fucking,

89
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,190
is this like some sort of human slavery?

90
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:41,760
Are you,

91
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,320
do you really wish you had a real person?

92
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:45,840
What if this inspires people
to actually get real slaves?

93
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:46,530
You know,

94
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,730
and then they don't do to have that.

95
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,550
That guy had that girl trapped
under his bed and he was married.

96
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,990
He made her sleep under his bed.

97
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:53,100
Have you ever seen that thing?

98
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,461
Yeah.

99
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:54,390
Where was that?

100
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:54,840
Where the,

101
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,750
where the fuck was that?

102
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,810
She was like 18.

103
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,070
She could like go to the mall to me,

104
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,650
Shit.

105
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,490
And then she under the bed and they
just fucking did crazy shit to her.

106
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,370
I would that it's that.

107
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:04,900
It's that Stockholm Syndrome.

108
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,363
Is that right?

109
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,610
Where you believe that your
capture is helping you out?

110
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,370
So I've been in relationships like that.

111
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,430
The robot Fucker,

112
00:03:14,431 --> 00:03:17,440
I'll start off with a mouth and
then like as technology gets better,

113
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:17,811
the mouth,

114
00:03:17,811 --> 00:03:20,470
it gets smaller and smaller and smaller
and they know the beat and no mouth.

115
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,300
Why would you say that?

116
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,710
Because she taught a big bright,

117
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,580
not like blowjobs through some issues.

118
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:31,660
Anyway,

119
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,780
we're also brought to you by [inaudible]
dot com makers of Alpha brain,

120
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:35,620
Trintech,

121
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,731
immune shroom,

122
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:37,564
tech sport,

123
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,130
and a new mood.

124
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,720
All these things are nootropics and uh,

125
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,690
the other ones are performance
enhancing substances.

126
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,920
What's the five HTP one?

127
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:45,963
It's whole new moon.

128
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,560
I swear by that 100% and you're talking
to me about a guy that has obsessive

129
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:52,630
compulsive and anxiety issues.

130
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:53,500
I swear by that.

131
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,350
When I start spiraling I go
for that instead of Xanax.

132
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,750
And that is a bold fucking statement.

133
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,370
Well it's legit man.

134
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:04,000
What it does is it boosts your
brain's ability to make serotonin.

135
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:09,030
It gives you the building
blocks are serotonin and l
Tryptophan converts to five

136
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:10,031
HTP,

137
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:11,200
so that's in there as well.

138
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:14,560
So it's gone a sort of a
time release effect to it.

139
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:14,790
It's,

140
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,080
it's a very effective supplement and it's,

141
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:19,270
it's not something you have
to worry about if you're,

142
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,640
if you're fascinated by any of this stuff.

143
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,090
But there are,

144
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,740
what they are is called nootropics.

145
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,120
NOOTROPIC is n o t r o p,

146
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:31,121
I c and Google that and read
some information because
it's a very controversial

147
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:31,990
subject.

148
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,500
I bought,

149
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,500
I believe in nootropics.

150
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,010
I'm a big believer in vitamins and
supplements and eating healthy and uh,

151
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,050
I have always been interested in
taking the best fuel for my body.

152
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:45,010
And my belief,

153
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:47,380
the best fuel for your
brain has been mapped out.

154
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:47,680
It's,

155
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,880
they're called nootropics.

156
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:53,920
And Alpha brain is the best combination
of these nootropics that we know how to

157
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:54,670
make.

158
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,400
What's the highest class ingredients?

159
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:02,670
And we also make sure that there is a
100% money back guarantee on your first

160
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:04,241
order of 30.

161
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:05,830
We need like a cough button or some shit.

162
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,000
I didn't turn down my volume.

163
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,373
We

164
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,660
see I have a button.

165
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,420
You'll see.

166
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,260
I have like a button though.

167
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,230
So if I have to sneeze or anything,

168
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,540
am I clear my throat?

169
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,403
I have a button.

170
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,320
We should probably install those things,

171
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,163
right?

172
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,470
We should just have a
signal like you point to me.

173
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,540
That's a really good idea.

174
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,413
You just sneezed.

175
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,480
Whatever the fuck.

176
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,373
It's a big deal.

177
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,583
Um,

178
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:31,181
anyway,

179
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:32,200
I go to Joe rogan.net.

180
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:33,700
Click on the link for Alpha brain,

181
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,300
enter in the code named Rogan and you
can save yourself 10% off any and all

182
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:37,870
orders.

183
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,800
And what I was saying earlier,

184
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,250
we have a hundred percent money back
guarantee on the order of a first order of

185
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:43,060
30 pills.

186
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,110
So when you take something,

187
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:45,250
if you try and you're like,

188
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:46,150
this is not worth it.

189
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:46,960
This is bullshit.

190
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,430
You don't even have to return the product.

191
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,930
It's a hundred percent
money back guarantee.

192
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:54,850
We're trying to make it as fair as
possible while selling you stuff that I

193
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:56,170
absolutely believe in.

194
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,320
All right.

195
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,501
Hey,

196
00:05:57,501 --> 00:05:58,880
can I get some of that
shroom tech from you?

197
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,523
Okay.

198
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,820
A lot of shit for you.

199
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,390
Nice.

200
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,370
That's an Alpha brain to it.

201
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,350
Mix it up with the [inaudible].

202
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:05,890
We're celebrating Joe Rogan.

203
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,390
Powerful Bird Chrysler's here,

204
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:09,340

205
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,500
hotel experience.

206
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,100
[inaudible] Joe Rogan
podcast by night all day.

207
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,400
Powerful Bert Kreischer.

208
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,540
I'm planning mine.

209
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,081
I'm going to have it.

210
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:34,010
I'm going to try that and match and
Nick Diaz on the biggest stage possible,

211
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,750
whether it be Letterman,

212
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,220
like just slide it in,

213
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,220
but I want to make it unclear.

214
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,260
I want to make it awkward.

215
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,643
Hey,

216
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,530
Nick Diaz at night.

217
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:42,860
I mean,

218
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,311
nevermind.

219
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:44,144
Don't kid

220
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,393
Nick Diaz at night,

221
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:46,731

222
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:48,230
Fucking up Kll.

223
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,270
Sonin Chelsea,

224
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,470

225
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,660
I fucking that guys.

226
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,030
I've never been sold to an entity.

227
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:56,660
Yeah.

228
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,760
He could leave me into war.

229
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,490
It was a fascinating

230
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,060
dude.

231
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,691
He was really,

232
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:00,740
he's a fascinating guy.

233
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,000
You know what I really,

234
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,060
when it was really intense when he was
talking about how he was willing to fight

235
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:05,900
him in Brazil.

236
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,880
Yes.

237
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,720
And that he knew that even if he beat
him in Brazil in front of 80,000 people,

238
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:13,370
like they were going to want his head.

239
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,840
What did he say about the Brazilians?

240
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:15,950
Well,

241
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,731
you know what I mean?

242
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:17,810
He said a lot of shit.

243
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,230
He's,

244
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,370
he's insulted.

245
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:20,780
Noguera who's,

246
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:21,140
uh,

247
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,973
you know,

248
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,073
um,

249
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,890
who's the Anderson Silva's Jujitsu
trainer and a famous mixed martial arts

250
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:31,850
fighter or former pride champion
and one of the all time greats.

251
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,013
It's like,

252
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,080
it would be like insulting Muhammad
Ali or something along those lines.

253
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:36,741
Or insulting.

254
00:07:36,741 --> 00:07:36,891
No,

255
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:37,880
I wouldn't say Mohammad Ali,

256
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:38,890
sugar ray Leonard or something.

257
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,130
You know,

258
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:39,621
you know what I mean?

259
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:40,060
It's like,

260
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,370
yeah,

261
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,090
cause he's not like a political
figure during your boundary.

262
00:07:43,091 --> 00:07:45,410
So Neil's joke about my was very fox.

263
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,040
No.

264
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,190
How's my favorite watching Michael J.

265
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,880
Fox on a new conference about
Parkinson's and this motherfucker.

266
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,300
I'll shake the chip

267
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,071
out,

268
00:07:56,071 --> 00:07:56,761
shake the chimp.

269
00:07:56,761 --> 00:07:57,930
Mom is trying to catch up,

270
00:07:57,931 --> 00:07:58,351
but he's like,

271
00:07:58,351 --> 00:07:59,184
I got you mom.

272
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,320
It was a genius.

273
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,180
He was so fucking funny,

274
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:03,701
mother fucker.

275
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:04,081
So anyway,

276
00:08:04,081 --> 00:08:04,914
back to on it.

277
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,100
It's so funny.

278
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:06,401
He go,

279
00:08:06,401 --> 00:08:06,890
Brian,

280
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,723
um,

281
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,970
she'll sign in a,

282
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,270
you know,

283
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,220
since he insulted
Minotauro Nogueira who I,

284
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:11,711
like I said,

285
00:08:11,711 --> 00:08:13,540
it's a great champion and you know,

286
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:13,780
uh,

287
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,051
in,

288
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:14,651
in Brazil,

289
00:08:14,651 --> 00:08:15,260
he's like a,

290
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,240
he's a fucking hero,

291
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,103
you know,

292
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,410
insulted his Jujitsu and is just,

293
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,700
there was a lot of,

294
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:22,650
lot of,

295
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,650
lot of negative things to be said about
Brazilians and so they fog and aide him

296
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,810
and people don't realize how like
Nationalistic Brazilians are.

297
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:32,230
Man,

298
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,000
I got that from that
podcast that I was like,

299
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,370
they'd take it to the next level.

300
00:08:36,371 --> 00:08:41,090
I've never been in a crowd that so
nationalistic that was so wanted the,

301
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:45,580
the Brazilian fighters to win and fucking
hated when the foreign fighters want.

302
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,030
Really?

303
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,211
Yeah.

304
00:08:46,211 --> 00:08:47,500
Only one foreign fighter one.

305
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:49,270
Mike Kyle was the only guy won that night.

306
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,240
And there were some fucking scar wraps.

307
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,201
I'll tell you the,

308
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:53,560
the,

309
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,920
the energy and the crowd is so intense.

310
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,170
They love fighting in Brazil.

311
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,640
They fucking love it man.

312
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,140
But very respectful people.

313
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,250
Very nice people.

314
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,450
Very friendly.

315
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:03,931
You know,

316
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:06,990
it's not like there's a bunch of thugs
going around like everywhere you go

317
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:08,700
people are pretty chilled and laid back.

318
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:13,540
It's a beautiful country and I like to
go buy grain does not going to probably

319
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:14,374
never going to happen.

320
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,563
You could go with me.

321
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,070
You want to go with me fucking in.

322
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:17,580
Okay.

323
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm done.

324
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,050
Why do you think it's not going to happen?

325
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:21,420
You travel like every fucking
week or about to go to Scotland.

326
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,400
This is UFC in Brazil and June.

327
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:24,683
You with me?

328
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,533
All right.

329
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,760
If it fits in my fucking schedule,

330
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:27,780
my schedule is chaotic.

331
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,023
I'm in.

332
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:30,991
I'd love to do that.

333
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:33,840
I don't want to get to fucking
Brazil a while that would get,

334
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,261
you know what?

335
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:34,951
It's crazy man.

336
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:37,010
When you just look out over the ocean,

337
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,450
like their view that they have like,

338
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,141
like,

339
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:41,220
especially in Rio,

340
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,500
it's like I'm so,

341
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,660
they're like so connected to nature.

342
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:46,801
You know what I mean?

343
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:48,780
Like they're completely
connected to nature.

344
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,441
I mean,

345
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:50,280
you look at uh,

346
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,680
how Rio is with the favelas and the
hills and the city at the bottom and the

347
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,970
ocean's right there and
the way you look at it,

348
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:57,211
it's like,

349
00:09:57,211 --> 00:09:57,510
man,

350
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,590
they're constantly reminded by nature.

351
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:01,640
You know,

352
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,440
that's something that a lot of
places in America just don't have.

353
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:05,850
New York doesn't really have that.

354
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,090
You see mostly buildings see
mostly shift that we made.

355
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:13,830
There's something about being in the
presence of something like mountains and

356
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:16,320
ocean where it just makes it go shit.

357
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,180
Or even just like wind,

358
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,870
like I went to the top of Mount Washington
and the winds were like 110 miles an

359
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,680
hour and you were up
there and you literally,

360
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,340
I met my heart,

361
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:27,480
sunk out of my asshole.

362
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,051
I was like,

363
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:29,810
I could be lifted off his mountain by God.

364
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,570
Just see a Bert to,

365
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,500
could you fucking imagine that's happened
before people had been taken off the

366
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:35,190
sides of cliffs?

367
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,941
Fuck yes.

368
00:10:35,941 --> 00:10:36,121
Yeah,

369
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:37,290
they have cool dude.

370
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,870
Cars get tripped over by wind that,

371
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,501
oh wait,

372
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:40,921
hold on.

373
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:44,310
So we selling me when I'm driving on the
street and I feel my car getting pushed

374
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:44,880
by wind.

375
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,840
It's totally possible.

376
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:46,780
There are cars that have,

377
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,680
cause I always go,

378
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,770
it'll never happen in and huge storms.

379
00:10:49,771 --> 00:10:51,540
Of course I sauce hurricanes.

380
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:51,871
Yeah.

381
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:53,580
Well you know in Dallas,

382
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,140
the last tornado man,

383
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:56,020
they were doers,

384
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,050
semis that were flying in the air.

385
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,130
You didn't see that.

386
00:10:59,130 --> 00:10:59,371
No,

387
00:10:59,371 --> 00:10:59,641
I didn't.

388
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:00,391
Oh my God,

389
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:00,541
dude,

390
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:01,590
that was just this year,

391
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,420
this year in Dallas.

392
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,260
Have you seen it?

393
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:04,951
Pull up the video,

394
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:05,131
man.

395
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:08,340
You've got to show it to them because
it's just so have a video of a hard to

396
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:08,901
look at it.

397
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:13,901
It's just you to try to wrap your mind
around something that could take a

398
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:16,320
Samurai and floated in the air.

399
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,610
Something that you can't see.

400
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,080
An 18 wheeler truck.

401
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:23,550
It's invisible and it's floating this
fucking semi in the air and the only

402
00:11:23,551 --> 00:11:24,660
reason why it's visible at all,

403
00:11:24,661 --> 00:11:28,800
it's because it's got a swarm
of shit that it's carrying.

404
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,480
It's circling around.

405
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,850
It's got a swarm of shit inside of it.

406
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:34,050
Fuck God.

407
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:34,441
Damn it.

408
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:35,274
That's scary.

409
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,470
What do you do in that situation?

410
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,440
You get pulled up in the wind.

411
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:37,740
Did you,

412
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,870
is there anything scary then
seeing that funnel cloud,

413
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,840
just knowing there's nothing that
can stop it and you and that,

414
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,240
but that thought where you go,

415
00:11:45,241 --> 00:11:46,740
there's no way this is going to get me.

416
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:48,541
Look at that dude.

417
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,450
He's flying through the air.

418
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,990
Those can you see that semis

419
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:55,763
several.

420
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:59,650
It's grow twirling around in the sky
and then dropping down from at least 50

421
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:00,940
feet high down into the ground.

422
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,610
You look at that to look at that.

423
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:03,993
Look at that.

424
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,760
Don had comes bang lands,

425
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:07,890
lands on the top of mind.

426
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,260
Semis,

427
00:12:12,261 --> 00:12:13,094
dude.

428
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:13,820
Uh,

429
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,130
certainly we have to say 18 wheelers,

430
00:12:16,131 --> 00:12:18,140
man on the Saas side of Dallas.

431
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,950
Still within parts of it,

432
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,680
like three of them.

433
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,100
It's juggling semis.

434
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,810
Those are light poles.

435
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,200
Those are light poles that are
standing up in the semis were like

436
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,160
Holy Dallas.

437
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,360
Look at that fucking thing,

438
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:32,631
man.

439
00:12:32,631 --> 00:12:34,130
Area around,

440
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,013
uh,

441
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,690
the Mesquite area just to
the west of mosquitoes.

442
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:43,010
It's so weird that we're so like so
nonchalant about these things about

443
00:12:43,411 --> 00:12:45,330
tornadoes and living in the,

444
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,080
just even the remote possibility
that a tornado might hate your area.

445
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,870
Like shitting.

446
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,990
You factor that in to
where you fucking live.

447
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,190
Everything you do,

448
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,420
that should be factored.

449
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,060
You should have definite
escape plans into a seller.

450
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,470
Like you shouldn't just be like,

451
00:12:58,471 --> 00:12:58,741
well,

452
00:12:58,741 --> 00:12:59,251
if it comes,

453
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:00,084
let's just hope.

454
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:04,650
Did you ever see that Joplin Missouri
footage where they showed the before and

455
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:05,470
after,

456
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,570
I believe it was Joplin,

457
00:13:06,571 --> 00:13:07,110
Missouri,

458
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,840
it was a town that was literally erased,

459
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,700
literally erased the Tornado's coming.

460
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,291
It's scary.

461
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,270
Scary thing is they can come
in the middle of the night,

462
00:13:15,271 --> 00:13:15,950
man,

463
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,160
they can come in the middle of the night.

464
00:13:17,161 --> 00:13:18,810
So you have to have like tornado warnings,

465
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:22,130
so someone's gotta be paying attention
and they got a blow horns and then you've

466
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:27,131
got to get it in your basement while the
monster made out a wind rips your house

467
00:13:27,271 --> 00:13:28,104
apart.

468
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:28,351
Like,

469
00:13:28,351 --> 00:13:28,591
dude,

470
00:13:28,591 --> 00:13:32,670
they had entire communities just vanished.

471
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,550
They completely vanished
down to the foundation.

472
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,121
It's like,

473
00:13:36,121 --> 00:13:38,000
if that was a wind that was a,

474
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,170
a werewolf that was doing that.

475
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,190
You know what I'm saying?

476
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,351
A bad wolf.

477
00:13:42,351 --> 00:13:44,160
The once a huff and puff
and blow your house down,

478
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:44,671
you'd be like,

479
00:13:44,671 --> 00:13:46,200
we gotta kill that fucking thing.

480
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,540
We've got to get away from where it lives.

481
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,021
We can't,

482
00:13:49,021 --> 00:13:49,350
you know,

483
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,200
but instead of it being
aware of scape plan,

484
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,550
it's a wind monster.

485
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,260
And we just sort of accept it.

486
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,080
And they,

487
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,670
you live,

488
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,770
you live in the path
of a fucking werewolf.

489
00:13:58,890 --> 00:13:59,850
It's a wind monster,

490
00:13:59,851 --> 00:14:00,450
man.

491
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,290
It's a god.

492
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,273
It's Thor.

493
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,151
You know,

494
00:14:03,151 --> 00:14:04,710
it's ripping houses a pie.

495
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:05,640
It's a god.

496
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,480
I mean,

497
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,310
no wonder why is storms.

498
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:08,850
You know,

499
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,111
when,

500
00:14:09,111 --> 00:14:11,190
when you know people were savages,

501
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:13,530
they thought it was the anger of the gods.

502
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:14,160
You know?

503
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,120
No wonder why.

504
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:15,990
Could you imagine?

505
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,651
You don't know where.

506
00:14:16,651 --> 00:14:18,990
It's still something like Katrina,

507
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,640
where you don't know when it's coming.

508
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,000
You both,

509
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,833
maybe it is,

510
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,250
maybe it's a reaction.

511
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,010
Maybe it's a reaction to
what's being disrespectful.

512
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:26,221
Well,

513
00:14:26,221 --> 00:14:28,920
it's maybe reaction
just to the biological,

514
00:14:28,921 --> 00:14:30,970
the sheer size of the,

515
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:33,240
the biological entities of the human race.

516
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:33,751
You know,

517
00:14:33,751 --> 00:14:37,380
the massive amount of waste that we put
out and if that makes it global warming

518
00:14:37,381 --> 00:14:40,140
and if that really does pick
up the intensity of storms,

519
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,640
I know all that Shit's debated.

520
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,990
I don't know if that's true or not.

521
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,591
Whether or not,

522
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,190
I mean,

523
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,190
people have tried to make that
connection between human beings,

524
00:14:47,191 --> 00:14:51,120
global warming and the
acceleration of these big storms,

525
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,920
but I don't know where
the status of that is,

526
00:14:52,921 --> 00:14:54,560
so I don't want to speak to that,

527
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,840
but it's negative energy all collected.

528
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:57,340
But what,

529
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:57,550
how,

530
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,430
where would it be if that's,

531
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,940
if we found out it was true that we
found out that once people get to certain

532
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:02,930
fever pitch,

533
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,561
you know,

534
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:04,740
the earth just has a,

535
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,760
a response of these big gusts of wind
monsters to sorta like shut everybody the

536
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:10,634
fuck up.

537
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,410
Why is it so fucking warm over here?

538
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,390
If we were all hippies and
it just be sunny every day

539
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,880
where sunny and beautiful.

540
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,080
Did you imagine that?

541
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:18,741
That's what it is.

542
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:23,741
It's like God's death squad is a tornado
is God just sends them down every now

543
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:24,981
and then,

544
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:27,170
please get these cuffs off my planet.

545
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,100
And you're just here,

546
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,410
Jo Cox are,

547
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,450
it's just a thing where you
know God created people,

548
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:37,451
but people just figured out how to
get way too good at some shit way too

549
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:38,924
quickly.

550
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,070
And it's the race between it nature
trying to squash us and US trying to

551
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:44,600
transcend being human.

552
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,510
I feel fucking bizarre concept.

553
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,320
It's the race.

554
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,370
It's the race right now.

555
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:50,571
That's the rice.

556
00:15:50,571 --> 00:15:55,100
It's between us coming up with some
sort of technology that lists us,

557
00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:00,430
lifts us out of our monkey existence or
the to or swallowing us up in a super

558
00:16:00,631 --> 00:16:01,464
volcano.

559
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,350
Fuck.

560
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,460
That's some good champagne.

561
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,500
It was a great champagne.

562
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,450
That's fucking new.

563
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,160
Celebrating.

564
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,090
They're celebrating.

565
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:08,541
Hold on,

566
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:08,841
hold on.

567
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:10,070
Let's wrap this up because I'm a little,

568
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:11,200
my mind's a little fucking blown.

569
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:12,034
Okay.

570
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,400
That fucking concept is
like is it was bizarre.

571
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,500
The fucking God is just,

572
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,060
it's that ridiculous.

573
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:20,340
Really.

574
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,173
It's just weather.

575
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,153
Nope.

576
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,761
All right,

577
00:16:23,761 --> 00:16:27,010
so the reason I'm say it,

578
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,943
but

579
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,760
the system and if like you know
certain things got too high,

580
00:16:31,761 --> 00:16:35,630
like human waste of human waste cause a
certain amount of disease which it does,

581
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,050
you know things where we fuck things
up cause a certain amount of debt.

582
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:43,150
It's almost like cancer with
Saks you lost me fellow.

583
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,340
Yeah.

584
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,980
If you have sex then that's the
planet's way of getting back.

585
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,210
Like stop having sex.

586
00:16:49,211 --> 00:16:52,090
Then did you read the fucking Bible
and we're going to make cancer.

587
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,620
So if you stop having never mind,

588
00:16:53,621 --> 00:16:54,770
I don't know about,

589
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,091
oh my God,

590
00:16:58,091 --> 00:17:01,720
I think I kind of like what
if it was connected cancer,

591
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,420
the worst thing in the real connected
with the best thing in the world.

592
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,250
Kind of like the same kind of Carmen.

593
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:11,170
We'll see what happens when you get high
is that the eye is what I think is that

594
00:17:11,171 --> 00:17:12,880
you have a paragraph in your head.

595
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,320
It's very well thought out,

596
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,310
but all you can piece together like five
words out of that paragraph and your

597
00:17:18,311 --> 00:17:20,500
brain's scrambled and
picks the five best ones.

598
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,140
And the worst is when you're
halfway into the paragraph and go,

599
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:23,974
what the fuck?

600
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,343
Talking about

601
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,533
it is the worst

602
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,660
that out.

603
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,670
If it was a normal thing,

604
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,190
oh you know how awesome I would look.

605
00:17:36,191 --> 00:17:39,250
And then you would look and we would all
look at the edited all these things and

606
00:17:39,251 --> 00:17:44,251
like our [inaudible] friends,

607
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,000
I give an that.

608
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,930
I'm fucking those best of
the Brian Clips on Youtube.

609
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:52,971
They made me laugh.

610
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,270
So fucking hard.

611
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:57,900
Cause there's something I'm very similar
to Brian and a lot of ways is that

612
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:58,650
we're,

613
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,970
I think we're both very childish.

614
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,370
Both have their child heart.

615
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,160
And so I hear some of these things and
I can tell when he's trying to be funny.

616
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:06,570
I can tell he's trying to be serious.

617
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,560
I fucking laughed in a
hotel room bed for an hour,

618
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:12,030
just watching it over and over again.

619
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,210
That's pretty ridiculous.

620
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:17,820
Which you call out all the best moments,

621
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,590
you know the best.

622
00:18:19,591 --> 00:18:20,940
My favorite one is when he goes,

623
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,620
my dad has magic glasses,

624
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,530
you can one can see up close in one.

625
00:18:25,531 --> 00:18:26,120
And then I'm,

626
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,180
I'm listening and I go,

627
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,330
they're called bifocals ass judgment.

628
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,480
Franklin had their own business.

629
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,060
My Dad only has back in Ohio,

630
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:36,810
bought one of those things where
it's a belt that goes around really,

631
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:40,170
really fast and it has like
these metal prongs that,

632
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,360
that I just hover over the belt,

633
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,740
the rubber belts,

634
00:18:43,741 --> 00:18:48,570
so in it collects electricity and then
you put this little dome on it and the

635
00:18:48,571 --> 00:18:51,740
electricity then collects
inside the dome and it gets off.

636
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:57,140
I think it's 20,000 volts of electricity
it makes or something like that quiz.

637
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,300
And so he's showing this
to me and he's like,

638
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:00,900
he's like,

639
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,320
he's,

640
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:01,760
let me see,

641
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,780
this is what he's doing on his free time.

642
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,201
He's like,

643
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:04,630
look,

644
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,680
here's all these batteries
like lined up and he's wires.

645
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:07,951
He's like,

646
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:12,280
I'm trying to have the electricity
conduct and copper wires and,

647
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,890
and he's like explaining like this whole,

648
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:14,251
and he's like,

649
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:15,300
if I could figure this out,

650
00:19:15,301 --> 00:19:16,350
we're going to be billionaires.

651
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,310
And I'm like,

652
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:17,850
what?

653
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:18,271
And he goes,

654
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:20,270
watch what happens when I turn
off the light and he puts that,

655
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,090
he takes a metal hammer with our rubber
thing and he just holds it out the

656
00:19:24,091 --> 00:19:24,301
thing.

657
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:27,930
And the electricity just starts
shooting towards the hammer.

658
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:28,831
And then in between,

659
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:29,011
you know,

660
00:19:29,011 --> 00:19:30,300
the Perri pullout nails,

661
00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:33,690
like the Little v thing and just
electricity's going back and forth really,

662
00:19:33,691 --> 00:19:34,381
really fast.

663
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,214
And it's like,

664
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:35,641
I was like,

665
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:35,971
Dad,

666
00:19:35,971 --> 00:19:39,660
what the fuck are you need to start
smoking weed because this is really cool.

667
00:19:39,661 --> 00:19:43,320
If you were high just going into this
little fucking thing that he's got to Domo

668
00:19:43,321 --> 00:19:44,070
written.

669
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,461
No,

670
00:19:44,461 --> 00:19:44,910
he just,

671
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,710
he just holds onto the rubber of the,

672
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,430
the,

673
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:47,960
the,

674
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,440
the hammer to your dad.

675
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,053
Didn't you get your dad?

676
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:52,141
No,

677
00:19:52,141 --> 00:19:52,780
it was,

678
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,150
we'd pop.

679
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,110
So soda.

680
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:55,561
Yeah,

681
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,394
he didn't know.

682
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,930
He didn't know dosed him.

683
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,483
Really?

684
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:01,860
Dude,

685
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,581
I have it on video.

686
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:02,920
Awesome.

687
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,740
So why did you dose your dad?

688
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:05,130
Uh,

689
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,690
because I wanted him,

690
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,070
I wanted to see what would happen.

691
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,090
Oh my God,

692
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,260
mother fucker.

693
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,780
You know what happened?

694
00:20:12,781 --> 00:20:17,781
He became very giggly and laughing
and happy and it was really cute.

695
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,220
And I have never told him about it,

696
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,740
but I have it on a video.

697
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,920
And why would you tell him?

698
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:25,800
You tell him.

699
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,280
Cause I,

700
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:26,791
cause you know,

701
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:27,624
it was like,

702
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:28,471
I don't know.

703
00:20:28,471 --> 00:20:30,120
I didn't because I wanted
it because we were,

704
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,620
he was hanging out at my house.

705
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,490
I in California,

706
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:34,440
he was in town for work and he was like,

707
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,880
I only got to see him one night.

708
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,350
And he was hanging out with us having us.

709
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:37,541
He's,

710
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:38,430
he likes to drink,

711
00:20:38,431 --> 00:20:39,510
he likes to have a couple of drinks,

712
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,403
have a cocktail.

713
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:41,890
Right,

714
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:42,180
right.

715
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:42,960
He was having fun.

716
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,171
And then,

717
00:20:43,171 --> 00:20:45,570
so we were all sitting
around and I think you are,

718
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:46,920
somebody gave me a bottle,

719
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:47,763
this huge,

720
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,020
huge champagne bottle.

721
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,940
It looked like a champagne bottle,

722
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:53,890
but it was a pop soda pop.

723
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,740
And so I poured a glass and
Katie podcast and I was like,

724
00:20:56,741 --> 00:20:56,921
Dad,

725
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:57,671
do you want some of this?

726
00:20:57,671 --> 00:20:58,510
And like I said,

727
00:20:58,511 --> 00:20:59,290
it kind of like,

728
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,030
I don't know if he knows what this is,

729
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:01,840
but he's like,

730
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,051
sure,

731
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:02,884
I'll have some of that.

732
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,311
And I'm like,

733
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:04,144
okay.

734
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,240
And then I just gave it to him.

735
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:05,740
And,

736
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,041
and,

737
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:06,370
uh,

738
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,121
it started off with,

739
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:07,271
you know,

740
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:07,871
my dad was just,

741
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:08,020
you know,

742
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,280
talking like he usually does,

743
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:09,430
you know,

744
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,600
about how to,

745
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,943
you know,

746
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,260
break perpetual motion or
whatever he always talks about.

747
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,310
And then,

748
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:15,940
uh,

749
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,430
then he just became
giggly and happy and he,

750
00:21:18,431 --> 00:21:20,890
it was just like shitty
grin the whole time.

751
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:21,400
It's so great.

752
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,660
Wouldn't you tell him about this?

753
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:23,763
I don't know.

754
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,910
I guess it is like a big yeah,

755
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:27,210
but it seems like he enjoyed it.

756
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:27,510
Yeah.

757
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,540
And I think it seems like,

758
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:28,811
yeah,

759
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:29,644
but he,

760
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,401
he was a real job.

761
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:31,480
He would've got drug tested.

762
00:21:31,481 --> 00:21:31,840
I would've,

763
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,280
he would've got fired from his job.

764
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,100
He gets drug test.

765
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,440
I swear.

766
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,600
I've never smoked pot in my life.

767
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,111
Well,

768
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:42,580
according to your hair follicles,

769
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,261
three weeks ago,

770
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,520
you were higher than front.

771
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,140
It was a long time ago.

772
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,063
I could never do it.

773
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,993
My Dad,

774
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,020
my dad would fucking,

775
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,980
oh wow.

776
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,960
I just don't know why you
wouldn't just tell them.

777
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,490
I know I will.

778
00:21:54,491 --> 00:21:55,324
One day

779
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,510
lead becomes legal in Ohio.

780
00:21:58,511 --> 00:21:59,000
I will tell,

781
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,970
I can't imagine my life like
five years I've told me so crazy,

782
00:22:03,971 --> 00:22:04,510
dude.

783
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,343
Just tell them

784
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,800
or better yet guys and were listening
and you know Brian [inaudible] I'll do

785
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:12,220
that.

786
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,053
Let me tell him.

787
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,040
Let me tell him so I could videotape it.

788
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:20,110
What the Fuck did you dad do to when you
were young that you want to torture him

789
00:22:20,111 --> 00:22:20,800
like this?

790
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,210
He made me look at the his inventions
and machines you've dealt with hours and

791
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:25,780
hours on end.

792
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,160
I just sat there and watched.

793
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:27,850
That's what we did.

794
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,200
Wires like there's,

795
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,160
there's a picture of me like
on a old school computer on,

796
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:35,380
have you ever seen me tweeted or whatever
and I'm just like playing on this old

797
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,820
like I don't know what it was.

798
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:37,440
Machine.

799
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,620
And that's pretty much what I did.

800
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:43,450
Like every night I would go downstairs
and watch my dad tried to invent crazy

801
00:22:43,451 --> 00:22:45,580
shit and fix things.

802
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:48,790
Like he's one of those guys that you
could give him anything and he would fix

803
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:48,910
it.

804
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,820
Like anything.

805
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,210
Like you give them a TV,

806
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,540
you give him a fucking car,

807
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,030
he'll take apart the car and
figuring out what's wrong with him.

808
00:22:55,031 --> 00:22:55,631
Rebuild.

809
00:22:55,631 --> 00:22:57,010
Like if that part isn't made anymore,

810
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,780
he would build that part.

811
00:22:58,781 --> 00:23:00,950
And what's crazy sounds
like your dad Mike.

812
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,590
Like my like math better.

813
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,570
Yeah.

814
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,800
To be a fun drug for your dad.

815
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:05,634
He got Adderall.

816
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:07,683
Adderall.

817
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,780
Close some shit down.

818
00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:11,614
Right.

819
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,880
Works like I love those lights.

820
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,250
Dude got in the Adderall
and went on a rage.

821
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:18,940
Who did?

822
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,291
Brian.

823
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:19,690
Brian.

824
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,850
What other luck on the
Adderall rates actually have?

825
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,010
My Dad's showing his computer machine.

826
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:25,180
You could hear how he talks.

827
00:23:25,181 --> 00:23:26,050
It's fucking crazy.

828
00:23:26,051 --> 00:23:26,670
Love to hear.

829
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,011
All right,

830
00:23:27,011 --> 00:23:27,191
let's,

831
00:23:27,191 --> 00:23:29,620
let's listen to my dad talk about it.

832
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,250
This is him going into his workshop
explaining his electricity machine or when

833
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,480
should you be giving this
stuff out on the air?

834
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:38,021
I mean,

835
00:23:38,021 --> 00:23:40,120
is this like a patent or
anything that your dad

836
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,960
generator now this hammer still shocked.

837
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:48,940
So I use this one going,

838
00:23:48,941 --> 00:23:49,774
I buy their handle.

839
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,040
Anything sharp like this.

840
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,800
It doesn't spark to it
like a lightning rod,

841
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,663
you know?

842
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,440
Can we turn the light off?

843
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,940
I think it will probably work in the dark.

844
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,120
Okay.

845
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,630
Oh my God.

846
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,660
I was like Mister Science.

847
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,280
Yeah.

848
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,910
You have to get your eyes used to the car.

849
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,400
It was so scary because
you can't see in the video,

850
00:24:12,401 --> 00:24:14,730
but there's like blue
light sparkling in there.

851
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,460
See the glow come over to the hammer.

852
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:22,890
Yeah.

853
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:23,671
So I know,

854
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:24,740
I hear you're an interesting,

855
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,570
but people don't understand
is this is in the dark.

856
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,463
Okay.

857
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:32,030
He's showing us the skinnies got it
was like one of those Tesla machines.

858
00:24:32,031 --> 00:24:32,241
Is that,

859
00:24:32,241 --> 00:24:32,371
yeah,

860
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:33,300
that's why it's something like that.

861
00:24:33,301 --> 00:24:33,570
Yeah.

862
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:34,321
So it's got what he's got.

863
00:24:34,321 --> 00:24:35,190
One is Tesla machines.

864
00:24:35,191 --> 00:24:35,780
He's got,

865
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,350
it's not a big laboratory either.

866
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:37,651
No,

867
00:24:37,651 --> 00:24:37,941
it's a,

868
00:24:37,941 --> 00:24:38,341
it's a,

869
00:24:38,341 --> 00:24:38,791
it's a,

870
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:41,640
it's a little work space
that he built the other day.

871
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,260
Recently he built the whole thing.

872
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,580
He just like tore down.

873
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,200
I like the side of his house,

874
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:46,651
like,

875
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,710
like with a sledge hammer and built
this humongous workshop for him.

876
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,881
And the other day he was like,

877
00:24:50,881 --> 00:24:51,701
I'm going to buy new cars.

878
00:24:51,701 --> 00:24:52,351
We buy new cars.

879
00:24:52,351 --> 00:24:54,480
So we extended his garage by two,

880
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,710
two cars.

881
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:57,861
Personal,

882
00:24:57,861 --> 00:24:58,340
married.

883
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:58,700
No,

884
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,251
they're divorced.

885
00:24:59,251 --> 00:24:59,380
They,

886
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,470
he's been remarried for like,

887
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:00,771
I don't know,

888
00:25:00,771 --> 00:25:02,450
1520 years or something like that.

889
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,340
That's a lot like you,

890
00:25:04,341 --> 00:25:04,761
I guess.

891
00:25:04,761 --> 00:25:05,150
Like you're,

892
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:07,280
you like that you're like
the tip figure shit out.

893
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:07,701
Yeah.

894
00:25:07,701 --> 00:25:08,301
He pretty much,

895
00:25:08,301 --> 00:25:09,380
if there was computers,

896
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:09,681
yeah,

897
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:10,730
when he was my age,

898
00:25:10,731 --> 00:25:12,410
he would be doing the
same thing with computers.

899
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,420
Would you like your,

900
00:25:14,421 --> 00:25:17,200
your creativity with computers and that,

901
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:17,691
you know,

902
00:25:17,691 --> 00:25:18,260
just your,

903
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,330
you're from hundred percent.

904
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:20,661
Really?

905
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:21,210
Wow.

906
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:21,590
That's,

907
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,191
that's amazing,

908
00:25:22,191 --> 00:25:22,491
isn't it?

909
00:25:22,491 --> 00:25:24,460
How that can be translated.

910
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:27,800
You ever met like the children of
singers who can just naturally sing?

911
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,430
Oh yeah.

912
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,263
Fuck yeah.

913
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,890
My kids are naturally,

914
00:25:30,891 --> 00:25:33,560
like I genuinely say my
kids are naturally funny.

915
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,370
Really?

916
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:34,581
Oh,

917
00:25:34,581 --> 00:25:35,450
100%.

918
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,060
Like my kids are like,

919
00:25:38,061 --> 00:25:39,680
they make other people laugh.

920
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:40,281
Like,

921
00:25:40,281 --> 00:25:40,550
uh,

922
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,450
like how old are your kids?

923
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,350
Five and seven.

924
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,480
And they're fucking funny.

925
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:44,901
I don't know,

926
00:25:44,901 --> 00:25:48,260
think it's from being around you been
around a comic or do you think it's

927
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,273
genetic?

928
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,061
I think two things.

929
00:25:50,061 --> 00:25:53,840
I think one is being around me and I'm
co I'm constantly lighthearted and I will

930
00:25:53,841 --> 00:25:55,220
always fucking,

931
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:58,400
my goal for everything is
laughter about everything.

932
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,430
And then I think also that I have a group
of friends that run through my house

933
00:26:01,431 --> 00:26:04,880
and my kids had been around and
they try to make them laugh.

934
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,730
And I think that that takes up to the,

935
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:06,981
you know,

936
00:26:06,981 --> 00:26:07,191
it's like,

937
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:07,460
look,

938
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,740
if you're sitting in the Baptist church
and nothing has happened to people at

939
00:26:09,741 --> 00:26:09,891
all,

940
00:26:09,891 --> 00:26:11,180
but if you're sitting in a Baptist church,

941
00:26:11,181 --> 00:26:12,590
you're trying to make
the baptist preacher lap,

942
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:13,431
it's pretty easy laugh.

943
00:26:13,431 --> 00:26:14,310
You don't really eat,

944
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:14,991
oh,

945
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:15,740
isn't that right?

946
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,670
Good job like it.

947
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,700
But it's not like a cultivated
like sense of humor.

948
00:26:19,701 --> 00:26:22,730
But when you got Thompson gorilla sitting
on the couch and he's drinking beers

949
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,140
and my kids are trying to make them laugh,

950
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:26,830
they come up with some
funny fucking my daughter.

951
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,000
Yeah.

952
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,350
I,

953
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:31,040
this is going to sound like a lie because
I'm just telling you this yesterday.

954
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,680
This is maybe the hardest
I've ever laughed at.

955
00:26:33,681 --> 00:26:34,514
My youngest daughter,

956
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:39,170
my wife was trying to brag on the fact
that her and my youngest daughter who

957
00:26:39,171 --> 00:26:41,210
were having problems
with developmental leave,

958
00:26:41,211 --> 00:26:42,200
she's not retarded.

959
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:43,980
But that sounds horrible to fuck.

960
00:26:43,981 --> 00:26:45,900
I shouldn't be talking because she's not,

961
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:46,734
she's not.

962
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,680
She just an emotionally,

963
00:26:49,681 --> 00:26:51,720
she's a a very wild kid.

964
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:52,770
She's a spirited child.

965
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,400
Okay.

966
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,920
So my wife's trying to
brag on her to a stranger.

967
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,720
I swear to God right now.

968
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:58,650
Okay,

969
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,000
well life goes island.

970
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:01,770
I had been playing cooties and I say,

971
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,251
this lady,

972
00:27:02,251 --> 00:27:03,450
Kathy's is sitting right there.

973
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,140
Really?

974
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:04,411
She goes,

975
00:27:04,411 --> 00:27:04,830
yeah,

976
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,311
and I love,

977
00:27:05,311 --> 00:27:06,870
what do we say when we,

978
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,690
when we lose a turn on Cody's and
Eila without missing a beat goes,

979
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:10,590
fuck your mother.

980
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:15,070
And I fucking fell apart
laughing at my wife goes,

981
00:27:15,071 --> 00:27:15,270
no,

982
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:15,421
no,

983
00:27:15,421 --> 00:27:15,810
no.

984
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,770
And I'm laughing so hard.

985
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:16,941
I,

986
00:27:16,941 --> 00:27:17,341
let's go.

987
00:27:17,341 --> 00:27:18,174
Fuck your mother.

988
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,880
Your mother and I think goes,

989
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,041
no.

990
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:20,380
He said,

991
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:20,820
my mom,

992
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,321
my wife's going,

993
00:27:21,321 --> 00:27:21,431
no.

994
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:21,631
We say,

995
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:22,860
Gosh darn it got started.

996
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,270
Dagnabit Lincoln,

997
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,900
I legos and then I'll adjust then
because she knows she's got a laugh.

998
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:28,883
She fucking,

999
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:29,710
everything's fucked.

1000
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:30,543
Your mother that day,

1001
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,070
it was five years old.

1002
00:27:32,071 --> 00:27:32,904
Fuck your mother.

1003
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,173
Fuck.

1004
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,320
I swear to you on both
of my children's life,

1005
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,870
that is exactly what
happened in Leham was like,

1006
00:27:39,871 --> 00:27:40,920
I don't know where she heard that.

1007
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:41,571
I was like,

1008
00:27:41,571 --> 00:27:42,404
if someone said,

1009
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,220
that's fine,

1010
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:44,671
isn't it?

1011
00:27:44,671 --> 00:27:49,671
That's the big concern amongst people
that are raising children is your kids

1012
00:27:50,131 --> 00:27:54,810
learning how to swear and swearing and
that being a sign of bad parenting.

1013
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,290
Oh,

1014
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,101
I'm a horrible parent.

1015
00:27:56,101 --> 00:27:58,260
That's foolish.

1016
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,420
It's so foolish.

1017
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:05,010
The idea that you're going to exclude
certain words and that somehow or another,

1018
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:09,180
this excluding of certain words is
going to make people behave differently.

1019
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:14,340
Is it really are going to
be comments is what it is.

1020
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,440
You can't change things by removing Fox
and you know like if a little kid say

1021
00:28:21,211 --> 00:28:21,541
fuck,

1022
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:23,210
it's funny what it was it,

1023
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,113
it's really bad.

1024
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:24,781
It's bad.

1025
00:28:24,781 --> 00:28:25,830
If you over fuck,

1026
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:26,281
you know,

1027
00:28:26,281 --> 00:28:28,830
if you're talking to him guys like this
fucking guy with his fucking thing till

1028
00:28:28,831 --> 00:28:29,664
the fucking,

1029
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,750
after awhile you're like,

1030
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:31,350
dude,

1031
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,520
you're killing my head.

1032
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,980
Like the way you're
communicating is bizarre.

1033
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:35,814
It's not,

1034
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,170
it's not comfortable.

1035
00:28:37,171 --> 00:28:40,220
I'm not receiving your
information very comfortably but,

1036
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:45,060
but just the occasional use of the word
that you want to use in the right place.

1037
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,980
I mean there's a reason
why those words exist.

1038
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,810
Just because some folks aren't that good
at using all the colors to paint with.

1039
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,000
It doesn't mean that those
boards should be excluded.

1040
00:28:54,001 --> 00:28:57,750
So I always get offended when people
say that their kids shouldn't swear.

1041
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:58,891
I'm like,

1042
00:28:58,891 --> 00:28:59,724
really?

1043
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,713
You know what?

1044
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,100
When is this going to stop?

1045
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,070
What is this nonsense of
bad words going to stop?

1046
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:05,291
Well,

1047
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:09,000
if he started off young then that
it would never be a big deal.

1048
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,810
You know?

1049
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:10,530
Exactly.

1050
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,720
Like if there's a reason
why in European countries,

1051
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:14,880
a lot of kids get to
drink and smoke house.

1052
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,710
I was just in Italy and they
were talking about this.

1053
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,520
All the kids,

1054
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,101
all of them were like,

1055
00:29:19,101 --> 00:29:19,190
well,

1056
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,110
it's not a big deal in our house.

1057
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,130
I got up wine if I want,

1058
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,660
so why would I care
about getting fucked up?

1059
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,730
They don't have as many issues.

1060
00:29:23,731 --> 00:29:26,880
I think a lot of our issues with
things that people have like as far as

1061
00:29:26,881 --> 00:29:28,710
obsessive compulsive issues or,

1062
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,630
or a addictive issues,

1063
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,510
I think it's just a little game that
your brain plays when you can't get

1064
00:29:33,511 --> 00:29:33,901
something.

1065
00:29:33,901 --> 00:29:36,040
Then he'd get it and he shouldn't
have it and then you want it.

1066
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:40,590
I think it's just this weird seesaw thing
that your brain can play and that and

1067
00:29:40,591 --> 00:29:45,040
part that one of the triggers
of that is suppressing people.

1068
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,200
So look,

1069
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,680
when we all know this,

1070
00:29:47,681 --> 00:29:49,120
we all knew this growing up.

1071
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,100
Who were the sluttiest girls?

1072
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,510
Catholic school girl.

1073
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,773
I say black.

1074
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,110
When I was growing up

1075
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,070
that actually had to go
to the Catholic school.

1076
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,450
They had to go to like all girls schools
be academy was where our roles when

1077
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,670
they suppressed the
shit out of these girls,

1078
00:30:09,671 --> 00:30:10,031
man,

1079
00:30:10,031 --> 00:30:13,750
they made them wear these little dresses
and they told him to stay away from

1080
00:30:13,751 --> 00:30:14,350
boys.

1081
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:18,070
And I remember I dated two different girls
that went to Catholic school and they

1082
00:30:18,071 --> 00:30:20,790
were both fucking free like,

1083
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,910
and when you're that age,

1084
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,530
when you get introduced to a freak,

1085
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:25,510
that way it blows your fucking mind.

1086
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:29,020
They just couldn't wait to get ahold of
some Dick because they were just told to

1087
00:30:29,021 --> 00:30:29,471
stay away,

1088
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:29,921
stay away,

1089
00:30:29,921 --> 00:30:30,460
stay away.

1090
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,010
I didn't realize what they're
creating and those women.

1091
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,150
And plus it's like those,

1092
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,040
it's still the savage blood lines.

1093
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:40,090
It's all Irish and Italian
and all these people in the,

1094
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,140
in the Catholic school that's,

1095
00:30:41,141 --> 00:30:42,520
those are savage bloodlines,

1096
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:42,820
man.

1097
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,870
Those are blood lines of,

1098
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:44,410
you know,

1099
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:47,530
people that have been cutting people
with swords for thousands of years.

1100
00:30:47,531 --> 00:30:47,950
You know,

1101
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:48,280
it's,

1102
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,190
it's an old European Cuban
that was all Catholic.

1103
00:30:51,191 --> 00:30:52,270
Girls' schools were Cuban.

1104
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,310
Can I keep them away from Dick too?

1105
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,420
I remember this chick,

1106
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,590
this chick Shannon,

1107
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,660
ninth grade start dating her.

1108
00:30:58,661 --> 00:30:59,291
I go to her house,

1109
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,660
Catholic from academy and we'd go to,

1110
00:31:01,661 --> 00:31:02,740
I go to her house for a date,

1111
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:05,110
like to hang out in her dad
won't let her fucking leave.

1112
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:05,861
So she goes,

1113
00:31:05,861 --> 00:31:05,981
well,

1114
00:31:05,981 --> 00:31:07,840
we were just sitting here down
and watch a movie and he goes,

1115
00:31:07,841 --> 00:31:07,931
well,

1116
00:31:07,931 --> 00:31:09,940
I'll be in the kitchen like a wall away,

1117
00:31:09,941 --> 00:31:11,410
right second he gets to there,

1118
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,581
she grabs my hand,

1119
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:14,150
starts sucking my fingers and I

1120
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,050
came with my peers

1121
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,840
because I was fucking
jacking off until then,

1122
00:31:26,841 --> 00:31:30,680
I had no concept and I remember I made
the mistake of telling everyone at

1123
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:31,514
school,

1124
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,480
I'll never forget.

1125
00:31:35,481 --> 00:31:38,840
I showed up and they told ty Rodriguez
and tired and I sat down for lunch and

1126
00:31:38,841 --> 00:31:39,231
ties like,

1127
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,130
cause who came in as parents.

1128
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,950
Oh Man,

1129
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:44,030
you fucking Dick.

1130
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,460
And then I think that's where I got my
sense of humor is because I ended up,

1131
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,070
you have to defend that in
a weird way too fucking,

1132
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,810
you can't be the guy that's a stud.

1133
00:31:50,811 --> 00:31:51,644
You the guy that came in

1134
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,840
so by that girls suck in your fingers.

1135
00:31:53,841 --> 00:31:55,260
She gave you a career in comedy.

1136
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,140
Probably is man.

1137
00:31:57,141 --> 00:31:57,450
I was,

1138
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,860
I was cool up until then,

1139
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,330
like I was fucking stud.

1140
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:01,800
Shannon,

1141
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,210
what's her fucking last name?

1142
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,290
I had to find her on Facebook.

1143
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:06,563
Oh Shit.

1144
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,940
There's this guy used to gate
that every time after sex,

1145
00:32:08,941 --> 00:32:10,530
like when we're spooning going to bed,

1146
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,180
like I always have like one arm
underneath her head and the other arm,

1147
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,030
she always wanted me
to put it in her mouth,

1148
00:32:15,031 --> 00:32:20,031
like the suck or Oh I found out that
she liked it best after trial and error,

1149
00:32:20,491 --> 00:32:22,440
that she always liked it
better when like on the nose.

1150
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,240
So I would,

1151
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,920
I wish she would suck my
thumb until she fell asleep.

1152
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,160
And then like I would have
like grandmother phone,

1153
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:28,680
you know,

1154
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,240
where he gets off wrinkly and I'd be like,

1155
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,830
I know that it was high.

1156
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:33,664
It was high.

1157
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:39,710
It was like baby while I know you're
fucking finger nails not clean.

1158
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:40,281
Oh,

1159
00:32:40,281 --> 00:32:43,460
she made them clean so
that if you look at mine,

1160
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,860
if you look at my phone and
it's always the cleanest one.

1161
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:55,570
And then sometimes like we would drink
cranberry vodkas or whatever and like I

1162
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,340
would have like a stain thumb and it was
kind of embarrassed because you can't

1163
00:32:58,341 --> 00:33:01,280
really wash the stain of the
cranberry off of your thumb.

1164
00:33:01,281 --> 00:33:03,230
So he would walk around with a red thumb.

1165
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:03,881
We know.

1166
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:04,270
Um,

1167
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:04,670
do you know,

1168
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:04,750
Whoa,

1169
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,010
that Guy Julian Assan from wikileaks,

1170
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,140
they got it's in trouble.

1171
00:33:08,141 --> 00:33:11,770
And is they do want to export it
to be honest with sexual assault,

1172
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,330
the League says by,

1173
00:33:13,331 --> 00:33:13,511
no,

1174
00:33:13,511 --> 00:33:14,170
the story,

1175
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:18,220
I don't know any of the really crazy
this guy released all these documents,

1176
00:33:18,221 --> 00:33:19,480
but what they're getting them on,

1177
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,050
what they're,

1178
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:23,620
they're prosecuting them on
is having sex with a girl.

1179
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:28,480
He had sex with a girl with a condom
on and then while they were sleeping

1180
00:33:28,481 --> 00:33:29,314
together,

1181
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:33,850
he apparently stuck it in without a condom
and was fucking her without a condom.

1182
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,980
And she charged him.

1183
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:39,010
It's like sexual surprise
or a surprise sex.

1184
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:39,971
Like for real,

1185
00:33:39,971 --> 00:33:41,260
it's not a real thing.

1186
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:41,700
Yeah.

1187
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,161
Yeah.

1188
00:33:42,161 --> 00:33:42,491
I'm not,

1189
00:33:42,491 --> 00:33:43,420
I'm not even joking.

1190
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,280
And this is like literally why they're,

1191
00:33:45,281 --> 00:33:48,640
they're making this guy like live in a
house arrest and constantly have to check

1192
00:33:48,641 --> 00:33:49,360
in and that,

1193
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:49,691
I mean,

1194
00:33:49,691 --> 00:33:53,140
it's the ball busting of him for,

1195
00:33:53,141 --> 00:33:55,130
for this one thing is,

1196
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,950
is extraordinary.

1197
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,371
It's like,

1198
00:33:57,371 --> 00:34:00,730
it's really confusing like how
much they're going after this guy.

1199
00:34:00,731 --> 00:34:01,960
But it's really not about that.

1200
00:34:01,961 --> 00:34:02,351
Of course,

1201
00:34:02,351 --> 00:34:03,670
it's about the Wiki leaks.

1202
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,780
Wiki leaks is an organization that
they got a bunch of documents from,

1203
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,200
uh,

1204
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:13,200
someone who was in the army and a lot of
it was like very controversial and uh,

1205
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,000
it just horrible shit.

1206
00:34:16,001 --> 00:34:17,200
Like one of them,

1207
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:22,260
they put out a video called collateral
murder and it showed these guys that are,

1208
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:23,320
uh,

1209
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,153
you know,

1210
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,080
in these helicopters,

1211
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,490
he's a fighter,

1212
00:34:27,491 --> 00:34:27,791
jets,

1213
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:29,020
whatever the fuck they were shooting from,

1214
00:34:29,021 --> 00:34:30,280
I think it was a helicopter.

1215
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,660
And um,

1216
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:32,850
they're uh,

1217
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:36,220
they're shooting on civilians
and they're shooting on they,

1218
00:34:36,221 --> 00:34:36,581
you know,

1219
00:34:36,581 --> 00:34:38,190
they think that these
people have guns and they,

1220
00:34:38,191 --> 00:34:42,880
in fact they have cameras and they open
up on these people and they open up and

1221
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:47,881
these people that we're putting kids in
there fucking minivan and when they hear

1222
00:34:48,221 --> 00:34:49,540
that they had kids in the car,

1223
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,220
they go up.

1224
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,880
Shouldn't been bringing
kids with them anyway.

1225
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,910
Like that was like their responses.

1226
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,300
Like you shouldn't have
been bringing kids.

1227
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:55,570
Like,

1228
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:59,980
it's not that we had to cut them down
with these fucking 50 caliber rounds.

1229
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,720
No,

1230
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,320
they shouldn't been bringing the kids in.

1231
00:35:02,321 --> 00:35:02,921
The first one is,

1232
00:35:02,921 --> 00:35:03,754
what are we going to do?

1233
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:04,840
It is what it is.

1234
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,070
Shouldn't been bringing kids.

1235
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:10,480
It's like they're the glee in being
able to take these people out,

1236
00:35:10,481 --> 00:35:11,314
like video games.

1237
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,160
You a soldier guy and then they
put this video out and there was,

1238
00:35:15,161 --> 00:35:15,490
you know,

1239
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:18,520
really controversial people
saying it's terrible for morale.

1240
00:35:18,521 --> 00:35:20,380
It's this is that it
shouldn't have been released.

1241
00:35:20,381 --> 00:35:23,800
And then it turns out that
there's a fuck load of documents,

1242
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,860
all kinds of shit that they
didn't want to have release in.

1243
00:35:26,861 --> 00:35:30,430
This kid had gotten ahold of this stuff
and pass it off to wikileaks and this

1244
00:35:30,431 --> 00:35:32,380
kid is still in solitary confinement.

1245
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,130
This kid is not Julian as lunch.

1246
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:34,410
No,

1247
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:34,481
no,

1248
00:35:34,481 --> 00:35:35,020
no.

1249
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,561
He's a,

1250
00:35:35,561 --> 00:35:36,490
I forget his name.

1251
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,231
Uh,

1252
00:35:37,231 --> 00:35:37,891
he's a,

1253
00:35:37,891 --> 00:35:38,724
uh,

1254
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,320
Avery.

1255
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,153
What is his name?

1256
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,190
Let me see.

1257
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:42,371
I'll,

1258
00:35:42,371 --> 00:35:42,631
I'll,

1259
00:35:42,631 --> 00:35:43,464
I'll look it up.

1260
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:44,363
Um,

1261
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,041
so the,

1262
00:35:45,041 --> 00:35:47,780
so then the US government
decided to go after wikileaks.

1263
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,281
Exactly.

1264
00:35:48,281 --> 00:35:50,710
Then just basically fucking
comb through this dude's life.

1265
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:50,891
Yeah.

1266
00:35:50,891 --> 00:35:52,990
Bradley Manning is the guy's name.

1267
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:53,480
He's a,

1268
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,081
he's a,

1269
00:35:54,081 --> 00:35:54,460
yeah,

1270
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,240
he's still in,

1271
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,310
I believe he's in solitary confinement.

1272
00:35:57,311 --> 00:35:59,810
I think he has great a years five.

1273
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:03,070
They caught him and they just
stuffed them in a cell and that's it.

1274
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,960
It's really scary shit.

1275
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,100
They wait.

1276
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,250
Julian Assange g is
the dude who leaked it.

1277
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,870
If it's a website.

1278
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,680
[inaudible] is Julian Assange is the guy
who ran wikileaks and he's the guy who

1279
00:36:14,681 --> 00:36:15,850
leaked all this information.

1280
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,970
What's really crazy is that
after it leaves the information,

1281
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:22,300
then the sex charge comes up and they
want to export them out of the country.

1282
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:26,440
I think the Norway where they have
these crazy sex laws like they have

1283
00:36:26,441 --> 00:36:26,860
different,

1284
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,693
you know,

1285
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:31,390
people have weird laws on rape know this
is where there's some feminists that

1286
00:36:31,391 --> 00:36:31,691
believe,

1287
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:31,930
and I've,

1288
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,040
I've actually written it,

1289
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:37,030
I've read this and had to go back and
read it several times just to really wrap

1290
00:36:37,031 --> 00:36:38,990
my head around whether or not I,

1291
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:39,260
I,

1292
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:44,260
I heard them right then the statement
was that they believe that if a woman has

1293
00:36:45,251 --> 00:36:50,251
been tricked by a man and deceived by a
man and to having and talked into having

1294
00:36:50,621 --> 00:36:51,454
sex,

1295
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,870
then that's rape

1296
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,550
and that's every girl
I've ever had sex with

1297
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,070
every girl.

1298
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,431
I mean,

1299
00:36:57,431 --> 00:36:58,960
isn't that amazing that you could,

1300
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,130
you should have the right,

1301
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,380
if you feel deceived after the act,

1302
00:37:02,381 --> 00:37:04,960
after the voluntary act of intercourse.

1303
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,070
And she thought

1304
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:06,640
like if the,

1305
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,420
if she tells you,

1306
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,710
if she just thought you were a good guy,

1307
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,301
I mean,

1308
00:37:09,301 --> 00:37:11,370
but to call that rape is crazy.

1309
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:11,700
That's,

1310
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,930
that is deception.

1311
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,540
But the sex was voluntary
so it cannot be raped.

1312
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:19,980
And just because you feel bad about
something that you were coerced into doing

1313
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,570
that wasn't illegal.

1314
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:22,001
Yeah.

1315
00:37:22,001 --> 00:37:23,110
What if you come really fast?

1316
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,520
I'd be good at it and I've
never been good at it,

1317
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,980
but it's not illegal.

1318
00:37:27,981 --> 00:37:28,910
It's sex.

1319
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,680
Rape is illegal.

1320
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,560
So you can't make sex rape.

1321
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,000
You're turning it into rape.

1322
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,110
It wasn't rape.

1323
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,100
You were tricked.

1324
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:37,760
Yes,

1325
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,720
but it was sex.

1326
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,730
You had voluntary sex,

1327
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,020
like to call that rape.

1328
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:47,180
That is anybody that would even think
that that would be an acceptable idea is

1329
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,830
an anti human that's,

1330
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,790
that's anti human.

1331
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,170
I will go for,

1332
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,940
I'll go as far to say that I believe.

1333
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:54,420
I mean,

1334
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,340
if you have me to put it down,

1335
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,620
I believe that rape is when a man,

1336
00:37:59,310 --> 00:37:59,820
uh,

1337
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,690
assaults a woman,

1338
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:01,070
uh,

1339
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,000
assaults a woman and
makes her do something.

1340
00:38:03,001 --> 00:38:04,800
She makes her have sex
when she does not want to.

1341
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,160
And I do believe there is a gray
line that we're date rape does,

1342
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:08,821
is involved.

1343
00:38:08,821 --> 00:38:10,180
I do believe there are guys that,

1344
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,371
that force it.

1345
00:38:11,371 --> 00:38:12,540
And the woman's saying no,

1346
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:13,021
but they do it.

1347
00:38:13,021 --> 00:38:13,490
Yes.

1348
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:16,350
And I believe there's also a
great line where women are drunk,

1349
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:16,771
too drunk.

1350
00:38:16,771 --> 00:38:17,551
And guys take advantage of,

1351
00:38:17,551 --> 00:38:17,970
I'm a dude,

1352
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:20,130
I've been around dudes my whole
life and I know that's happened.

1353
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:20,940
I'm at present,

1354
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,780
have done that.

1355
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,280
And the,

1356
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,240
and they as they walk
you through the night,

1357
00:38:24,241 --> 00:38:24,780
you're like,

1358
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,920
sounds a little rapey to me.

1359
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:26,650
But,

1360
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:27,270
but,

1361
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:27,541
but,

1362
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:28,370
but the,

1363
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:28,940
I mean,

1364
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,270
as they walk you through the night,

1365
00:38:30,271 --> 00:38:30,390
yeah.

1366
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:30,750
You're like,

1367
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,110
Ooh,

1368
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:31,850
you didn't watch.

1369
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:32,800
And you're like,

1370
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,090
Huh,

1371
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,140
maybe I should report you.

1372
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:34,710
So,

1373
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,350
um,

1374
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:40,350
but I do believe that because this is not
the subject I everyone's talking about

1375
00:38:40,811 --> 00:38:41,644
because it's a,

1376
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,910
like I went to college
when the word rape became,

1377
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:46,870
um,

1378
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:50,200
flip floppy and like chicks were saying
they got raped when they genuinely

1379
00:38:50,201 --> 00:38:50,590
didn't,

1380
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,423
do you know what I mean?

1381
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:55,720
Like the word rape was a buzzword and
so women were using the word rape,

1382
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,100
like throwing it out there.

1383
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,091
And then I think,

1384
00:38:58,091 --> 00:38:58,481
right,

1385
00:38:58,481 --> 00:39:01,390
like right after that is when
comics got ahold of the word rape,

1386
00:39:01,391 --> 00:39:04,390
like Sarah Silverman and
made it a joke and took it.

1387
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,500
That's why I love Sarah,

1388
00:39:05,501 --> 00:39:05,800
man.

1389
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,340
I'll fucking always love
that chick because she took
things that I think I would

1390
00:39:09,341 --> 00:39:13,510
joke about with my friends and as a woman
said them on stage and I thought I was

1391
00:39:13,511 --> 00:39:13,661
like,

1392
00:39:13,661 --> 00:39:14,740
fucking gangster dude.

1393
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:15,940
Fucking roles.

1394
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,810
Definitely gangster.

1395
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,501
She's funny,

1396
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:18,130
man.

1397
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,990
She should be a supreme court judge.

1398
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,330
Whatever she says is right.

1399
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:23,291
That should be it.

1400
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:24,550
Like there are women,

1401
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:24,921
I mean,

1402
00:39:24,921 --> 00:39:25,030
well,

1403
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,360
I dunno,

1404
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:25,661
I'm fucking,

1405
00:39:25,661 --> 00:39:26,494
what am I talking about?

1406
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:26,801
Well,

1407
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:29,980
it's human beings have to have their shit
together in order to be able to judge

1408
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:30,341
people.

1409
00:39:30,341 --> 00:39:33,670
And it's been pretty obvious that the
system that they're judging people under

1410
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:36,600
right now is just so flawed
and fucked up and no,

1411
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:36,840
no,

1412
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:40,300
no one's saying that it should all be
dismantled and that that's what's going to

1413
00:39:40,301 --> 00:39:41,134
have to happen.

1414
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:41,850
We're going to have to do,

1415
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:45,670
it would have to dismantle the
whole system to make anything fair.

1416
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,733
You know,

1417
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,180
Preme Court justice to
Supreme Court period.

1418
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,340
All your crazy fucking laws.

1419
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,540
Jesus man,

1420
00:39:52,541 --> 00:39:53,920
I heard a honeycomb,

1421
00:39:53,921 --> 00:39:54,670
a bullshit.

1422
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,280
I heard Chris rock say something
one time that kind of fucking,

1423
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,260
that redefined everything.

1424
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,980
Men I've had like things redefined
for me within the last few months.

1425
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,330
So big man,

1426
00:40:04,331 --> 00:40:05,200
like so big.

1427
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:06,850
We were talking about ego.

1428
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:07,270
I fucking,

1429
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:08,140
my ego is,

1430
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:09,003
is uh,

1431
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,570
that concept of ego.

1432
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:11,740
I've never understood.

1433
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,180
I fucking now understand,

1434
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,540
but Chris Rock said something about
was Saturday night live racist.

1435
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:17,560
I don't know where I heard it on.

1436
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:18,820
And he was saying,

1437
00:40:18,821 --> 00:40:19,091
no,

1438
00:40:19,091 --> 00:40:19,841
it's not racist,

1439
00:40:19,841 --> 00:40:24,470
but there is a shorthand would that two
white guys have that a black and white

1440
00:40:24,471 --> 00:40:27,730
guy don't have like two white guys
like and Michael and say Chris Farley,

1441
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:31,150
there's a shorthand that they have
that a black kid is not born with.

1442
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,210
And when I heard that I went,

1443
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,200
what do you mean by shorthand?

1444
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:35,141
Okay.

1445
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:35,411
Like,

1446
00:40:35,411 --> 00:40:36,244
um,

1447
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:36,881
like,

1448
00:40:36,881 --> 00:40:37,270
uh,

1449
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:40,960
like going into a meeting with a bunch
of white dudes and you just kind of,

1450
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,910
you understand them and like,

1451
00:40:42,911 --> 00:40:43,810
or like when a guy goes,

1452
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:44,741
man,

1453
00:40:44,741 --> 00:40:45,940
how about that fucking Diaz fight?

1454
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,040
And then all of a sudden you and him
have a shorthand and you go to a meeting,

1455
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:48,580
you're like,

1456
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:48,701
oh,

1457
00:40:48,701 --> 00:40:49,750
we have something in common.

1458
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:50,950
We can talk without,

1459
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,870
we know each other without having to

1460
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,980
dudes love doing shit like that.

1461
00:40:56,981 --> 00:40:58,660
And it's why I didn't play
golf together and stuff.

1462
00:40:58,661 --> 00:40:58,811
Right,

1463
00:40:58,811 --> 00:40:59,291
exactly.

1464
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,120
It's in white guys love it more than any,

1465
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:01,570
I mean,

1466
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:02,530
black guys love it too,

1467
00:41:02,531 --> 00:41:06,730
but what happens is your shorthand
comes from the people you grew up with.

1468
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:09,280
Like I know white dudes
who are in fraternities.

1469
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:09,940
Like,

1470
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,560
I don't even need to
fucking say a word to them.

1471
00:41:11,561 --> 00:41:12,640
I can tell you what they do.

1472
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:14,740
I can tell you how to act
when the cameras aren't on.

1473
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,360
I can tell you how I can tell
you everything about them.

1474
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:16,871
Right.

1475
00:41:16,871 --> 00:41:17,704
But black dudes,

1476
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:22,030
my shorthand is based on like pretty
much like the dude's I'd partied with in

1477
00:41:22,031 --> 00:41:22,864
New York.

1478
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:23,171
Like,

1479
00:41:23,171 --> 00:41:23,531
cause I don't,

1480
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:24,610
I just don't know brothers.

1481
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:25,660
And like,

1482
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,340
I know like Godfrey Rd,

1483
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,380
Tony Woods that night when Tracy Morgan,

1484
00:41:29,381 --> 00:41:30,100
like those are my,

1485
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,030
that's my shorthand.

1486
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:32,200
So I see what you're saying.

1487
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,010
So you're saying that there's,

1488
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,870
that white guys on Saturday night
live have more connectedness.

1489
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,240
They all went to Harvard.

1490
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,600
They all went to college.

1491
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:42,800
They're all into comedy.

1492
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:44,570
They all had the same comedy upbringing.

1493
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,140
Like they all had parents
that's probably either divorced,

1494
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,700
like they're part of the system,

1495
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:50,290
right?

1496
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:50,930
Lauren Michaels,

1497
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:51,681
Michaels being the head.

1498
00:41:51,681 --> 00:41:51,891
But she,

1499
00:41:51,891 --> 00:41:53,900
Chris Rock was saying
as a kid from Brooklyn,

1500
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,340
his shorthand wasn't there.

1501
00:41:55,341 --> 00:41:56,480
So when he met Lauren Michaels,

1502
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,433
he didn't,

1503
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,480
he didn't know the like,

1504
00:41:59,060 --> 00:41:59,421
I mean,

1505
00:41:59,421 --> 00:42:00,141
ultimately,

1506
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:00,351
you know,

1507
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,510
it's like when you meet
a network executive,

1508
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:04,790
I kind of know what to
say and what not to say.

1509
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,290
And I know how to act.

1510
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:10,520
I know to wear a collared shirt if it's
right and I know not to because I'm

1511
00:42:10,521 --> 00:42:10,760
white.

1512
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,120
I'm done.

1513
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,970
I've had to deal with white
men my whole fucking life.

1514
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,290
Like Chris Rock.

1515
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:17,060
Never if he dealt with a white man.

1516
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:17,660
Um,

1517
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,420
I'm guessing this is speculation
based on an interview,

1518
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:21,051
but it was like a,

1519
00:42:21,051 --> 00:42:25,040
it was a cop or a Joe going
to say he never got arrested.

1520
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:25,521
But you know what I mean?

1521
00:42:25,521 --> 00:42:26,960
Like when he saw white men,

1522
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,010
who was it from a different place,

1523
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,650
his average black man was
like a dad or a friend's dad.

1524
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:35,300
Those guys aren't running Saturday
night live or running heads of business.

1525
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,620
That blew me away.

1526
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,210
That concept of,

1527
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,073
of,

1528
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,690
of racism not being how people act,

1529
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:44,720
but just being like as
common as a shorthand.

1530
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,680
Like,

1531
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:45,981
you know,

1532
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:49,700
like that's very astute of him to point
it out to all it's fucking genius,

1533
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:50,001
man.

1534
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:54,320
That guy blows me away consistently
because the way he sees life,

1535
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:55,280
like I was just hearing,

1536
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:57,590
I was talking to one of his
contractors and he was like,

1537
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:00,410
this contractor was like
putting a window in his house.

1538
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,000
Now this is the difference
between Chris Rock,

1539
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:02,840
the Rock,

1540
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,700
the window was $20,000 and
he's putting his house.

1541
00:43:04,701 --> 00:43:06,080
I'm sure I'm not supposed
to be talking about this.

1542
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:07,003
Why are you doing?

1543
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:07,910
Why are you doing it?

1544
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:08,570
I'm telling you,

1545
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:10,430
you guys had to control my ego.

1546
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:11,140
He said,

1547
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:11,600
no.

1548
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,140
Anyway,

1549
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:12,591
the window,

1550
00:43:12,591 --> 00:43:12,800
um,

1551
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,850
it's an interesting story.

1552
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:15,820
So we put some window and it's $20,000.

1553
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,191
The guy goes,

1554
00:43:16,191 --> 00:43:16,490
hey look,

1555
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:17,201
I'll copy the one.

1556
00:43:17,201 --> 00:43:21,200
I'll give you the window if you let
me fucking put your mind TV show or

1557
00:43:21,201 --> 00:43:21,800
whatever,

1558
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,930
and like show that I'm
doing Chris Rock's house.

1559
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:24,891
Chris Rock's like,

1560
00:43:24,891 --> 00:43:25,724
man,

1561
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:26,840
if I show my family,

1562
00:43:26,841 --> 00:43:28,970
I'm putting in a $20,000
a window into a house,

1563
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,320
they're going to want
to stay in that house.

1564
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:30,921
Like,

1565
00:43:30,921 --> 00:43:33,740
I can't just fucking put
that on TV and I was like,

1566
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:33,911
oh,

1567
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:37,070
I fucking put that shit on TV because
my ego would come in and be like,

1568
00:43:37,071 --> 00:43:38,210
fucking Bam.

1569
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,100
Let's show everyone.

1570
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:39,440
I mean,

1571
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,050
why were you saying before that you
were having a problem with your ego?

1572
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:42,980
I just damn man,

1573
00:43:42,981 --> 00:43:43,814
it's genuine.

1574
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:44,251
You're,

1575
00:43:44,251 --> 00:43:44,870
you're not,

1576
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:45,350
you're,

1577
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:45,621
I,

1578
00:43:45,621 --> 00:43:50,270
I'm going to ask you to go back probably
15 years and try to connect to yourself

1579
00:43:50,271 --> 00:43:50,960
then.

1580
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,620
Okay.

1581
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:52,060
Okay.

1582
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:55,370
You've done a lot of work
I think on yourself that a
lot of people haven't done.

1583
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,070
So you know when people just go,

1584
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:01,280
when people just say like that you show
up to a bunch of comics and they're

1585
00:44:01,281 --> 00:44:01,790
like,

1586
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:02,121
everyone's like,

1587
00:44:02,121 --> 00:44:02,181
yeah,

1588
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:02,810
we won't shut up too.

1589
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:03,110
And he's like,

1590
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:03,261
ah,

1591
00:44:03,261 --> 00:44:04,310
I got to sit calm on this.

1592
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:04,661
I got sick,

1593
00:44:04,661 --> 00:44:05,150
I'm on Mat.

1594
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,050
And then you just,

1595
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:06,590
you,

1596
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:07,423
I was talking to Brian,

1597
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:11,130
you just casually try to slide
in what you're doing casually.

1598
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,290
Like oh that's so cool.

1599
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:12,891
I know Brian.

1600
00:44:12,891 --> 00:44:13,041
Yeah,

1601
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:18,041
I'm doing a thing with them like
and then and that to me is fucking,

1602
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:20,030
it's so unhealthy.

1603
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:25,520
It's the next self bragging self Bragg
and like it's so unhealthy and it's so

1604
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,250
disconnects your heart.

1605
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:31,830
This is what I've been thinking
disconnects your heart from humanity,

1606
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,430
right?

1607
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:32,681
It,

1608
00:44:32,681 --> 00:44:32,930
it,

1609
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:33,150
it,

1610
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:36,120
what it does is it puts your brain in it
cause your brain starts talking to your

1611
00:44:36,121 --> 00:44:36,780
heart going,

1612
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,111
hey man,

1613
00:44:37,111 --> 00:44:39,120
we're hurting in your
brain and your hearts.

1614
00:44:39,121 --> 00:44:39,954
Like why?

1615
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:40,351
He's like,

1616
00:44:40,351 --> 00:44:41,460
because you read what he's doing,

1617
00:44:41,461 --> 00:44:42,390
he's doing a bunch of shit.

1618
00:44:42,391 --> 00:44:43,350
You're not doing shit.

1619
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:44,041
And he's like,

1620
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:45,490
well then fuck you start to so,

1621
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,330
so you,

1622
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:51,330
you hear other people talk about the
stuff that they're doing and you want to

1623
00:44:51,751 --> 00:44:52,710
pump yourself up.

1624
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:53,540
Is that what you're saying?

1625
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,670
You almost have to do
a better hand at cards.

1626
00:44:55,671 --> 00:44:56,630
Like I like try to one,

1627
00:44:56,631 --> 00:44:57,081
I'm trying to,

1628
00:44:57,081 --> 00:44:57,850
one up,

1629
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:59,080
I had a conversation when we say,

1630
00:44:59,081 --> 00:45:00,820
let me the friend and he's a nice guy,

1631
00:45:00,821 --> 00:45:01,654
he's a comic.

1632
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:02,530
And uh,

1633
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:04,030
I ran into him and I said,

1634
00:45:04,031 --> 00:45:04,151
hey,

1635
00:45:04,151 --> 00:45:04,984
what's up man?

1636
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:10,020
And he just went on this embarrassing
run about some development deal and this

1637
00:45:11,411 --> 00:45:12,400
and if it doesn't go out,

1638
00:45:12,401 --> 00:45:13,690
I have a buyout and Dah,

1639
00:45:13,691 --> 00:45:13,860
Dah,

1640
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:14,011
Dah,

1641
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:14,171
Dah,

1642
00:45:14,171 --> 00:45:14,321
Dah,

1643
00:45:14,321 --> 00:45:15,010
Dah.

1644
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:16,630
And they've said that
this is their number.

1645
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:17,141
And I'm like,

1646
00:45:17,141 --> 00:45:17,471
Whoa,

1647
00:45:17,471 --> 00:45:18,304
really?

1648
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:18,970
You know?

1649
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:20,080
And then if that doesn't work,

1650
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,083
I've got to develop

1651
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:24,040
and it just went on and I'm like,

1652
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,270
I meant hi.

1653
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:26,060
I'm like,

1654
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:27,140
he does good to see you.

1655
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:27,801
You cannot be,

1656
00:45:27,801 --> 00:45:28,120
yes,

1657
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,930
your heart's connected to him.

1658
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:31,340
This is going to sound good.

1659
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,230
Can I get some Celine
Dion music in the back of

1660
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,690
your heart's connected
with him when you said,

1661
00:45:38,691 --> 00:45:39,470
how are you doing?

1662
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:40,760
You are genuinely asking,

1663
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:42,500
see his head was connected to you.

1664
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:43,550
What does his Joe Rogan,

1665
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,570
he's got this going on.

1666
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:47,570
I need to prove to him that it seems
like he probably left that conversation

1667
00:45:47,571 --> 00:45:47,841
going.

1668
00:45:47,841 --> 00:45:48,920
That went perfect.

1669
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:50,660
I think one of the nicest things,

1670
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:51,853
hey,

1671
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:53,160
do not put Celine Dion.

1672
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:56,160
We'll start fucking dick under the table.

1673
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,180
I,

1674
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,130
I'd like doing a lot of different things.

1675
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:03,030
I don't want to have my whole entire
identity to connect it to one thing,

1676
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:03,440
you know?

1677
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,390
And whether it's one thing in,

1678
00:46:05,391 --> 00:46:06,211
in my life,

1679
00:46:06,211 --> 00:46:07,560
whether it's one thing and what,

1680
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:09,060
what my occupation is,

1681
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:10,470
I just think there's a,

1682
00:46:10,471 --> 00:46:11,190
this,

1683
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:15,150
there's a lot to be gained
in flexibility and you know,

1684
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:16,310
in,

1685
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:20,220
in being able to do a bunch of different
things and not having to rely on one,

1686
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:23,610
I've been able to like
not have to define myself,

1687
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:24,743
you know,

1688
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,580
I'll do whatever the fuck I do.

1689
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:27,271
I do what I do.

1690
00:46:27,271 --> 00:46:27,511
You know,

1691
00:46:27,511 --> 00:46:32,130
like to worry about the world of
comedy or worry about the world of MMA.

1692
00:46:32,131 --> 00:46:34,110
A worry of I just do my shit

1693
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:34,910
we have now.

1694
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:39,060
That's you and that you are
not the average of people.

1695
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:39,601
Yeah,

1696
00:46:39,601 --> 00:46:40,980
but I think everybody can do it.

1697
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:41,970
I think everyone can do it.

1698
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,730
When I heard you talking,

1699
00:46:44,731 --> 00:46:45,710
I was in Europe and I,

1700
00:46:45,711 --> 00:46:46,210
you know,

1701
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:47,190
I fall asleep,

1702
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,910
I listened to show when I sleep I put a
play it all night long and I just have

1703
00:46:50,911 --> 00:46:52,530
it on repeat so I hear it all night long.

1704
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:55,590
It's one of the greatest things
if you don't already do that,

1705
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,740
that I'm telling you when I say that's
the greatest way to fucking listen to

1706
00:46:58,741 --> 00:47:01,800
podcasts because you feel like you're
hanging out with friends and they're in

1707
00:47:01,801 --> 00:47:02,910
the other room and you're safe.

1708
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,290
And I get lonely on the road.

1709
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,010
It's even better when it's you
on the podcast and you hear,

1710
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,110
I heard me talking to you
and I was fucking right.

1711
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:09,660
I was like,

1712
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,080
Oh,

1713
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,030
and I'm in my own dream
with you and I'm like,

1714
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:13,140
bug and this is awesome.

1715
00:47:13,141 --> 00:47:13,710
So,

1716
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:14,543
but,

1717
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,413
um,

1718
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:16,320
there's no like,

1719
00:47:16,321 --> 00:47:16,530
uh,

1720
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:19,830
like I was listening to you talking
about ego destroying ego with drugs,

1721
00:47:19,831 --> 00:47:20,041
with,

1722
00:47:20,041 --> 00:47:20,640
with,

1723
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,500
with um,

1724
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,060
getting into the tank and
getting rid of your ego.

1725
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:24,631
And I was like,

1726
00:47:24,631 --> 00:47:24,841
man,

1727
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:25,170
my,

1728
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:27,300
and I started thinking
about ego and I was like,

1729
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:28,860
where's my ego?

1730
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:29,290
Oh No,

1731
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:30,280
I just saw myself

1732
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,230
fucking arguing with people.

1733
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:32,411
Like,

1734
00:47:32,411 --> 00:47:33,041
not arguing,

1735
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:34,960
but being argumentative,

1736
00:47:34,961 --> 00:47:37,780
being difficult just about ego based Shit.

1737
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:38,591
Like someone would say,

1738
00:47:38,591 --> 00:47:40,060
this guy was a great host on this show,

1739
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:40,871
my crew,

1740
00:47:40,871 --> 00:47:41,680
and I'd be like,

1741
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,281
in my head,

1742
00:47:42,281 --> 00:47:43,720
my head is going to fuck their gallery.

1743
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:44,733
You're better than him.

1744
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:45,590
But I have not even.

1745
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:46,211
Yeah.

1746
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:49,390
And so I've been doing a lot of
work on my ego and trying to,

1747
00:47:49,391 --> 00:47:51,130
like I did in front of Ari last night,

1748
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:54,490
but I'll fucking own this shit.

1749
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,540
I saw Ari lessons.

1750
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:00,370
When you say you're
doing work on your ego,

1751
00:48:00,371 --> 00:48:01,001
what do you mean?

1752
00:48:01,001 --> 00:48:01,660
Like when you don't,

1753
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:05,650
I'm biting my tongue and I'm letting
myself feel the fucking disgusting

1754
00:48:05,651 --> 00:48:06,430
feelings.

1755
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:06,820
When you,

1756
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:07,330
you get a t,

1757
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:08,163
when you feel like,

1758
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:13,120
when you feel like [inaudible] statement
is directed at you like last night

1759
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:13,850
some,

1760
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:14,770
this is the bad eggs.

1761
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:16,270
I don't even want to
fucking use that example.

1762
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:16,991
Nevermind.

1763
00:48:16,991 --> 00:48:19,360
I'm not going to use that example because
ends up fucking really bad example.

1764
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:20,860
But Ari was,

1765
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:22,390
Ari saw me fucking bike.

1766
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,733
I started saying,

1767
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:24,813
I started to Brag,

1768
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:27,040
I started to say something
to brag and then I went,

1769
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:28,420
I stopped myself out loud.

1770
00:48:28,421 --> 00:48:30,130
And when I'm not doing that and he goes,

1771
00:48:30,131 --> 00:48:30,341
what?

1772
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:30,521
And I go,

1773
00:48:30,521 --> 00:48:32,950
I'm not saying what I'm about to
say cause it's a fucking stupid.

1774
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:33,784
This is stupid.

1775
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:34,990
So that's what I'm trying to do.

1776
00:48:34,991 --> 00:48:37,710
I'm trying to be more connected
to people by my heart and,

1777
00:48:37,711 --> 00:48:39,640
and hear what they're saying as a human.

1778
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:40,503
Just like when someone goes,

1779
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:40,961
hey man,

1780
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:41,240
how,

1781
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:41,620
how,

1782
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,300
what are you up to you as a comic?

1783
00:48:43,301 --> 00:48:43,991
You hear that and you're like,

1784
00:48:43,991 --> 00:48:44,621
what do I have to,

1785
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:45,200
I have a,

1786
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,090
I have this going on.

1787
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:46,924
I have this going on.

1788
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:47,650
Not like,

1789
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:48,550
oh my grades are good.

1790
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,990
They have a violin recital tomorrow.

1791
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,550
Like not like real shit,

1792
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:52,840
you know?

1793
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:53,230
Well,

1794
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:53,471
you know,

1795
00:48:53,471 --> 00:48:55,720
I think as a human being,

1796
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:56,480
when you,

1797
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,620
you have something that's your occupation
or something that you're obsessed

1798
00:48:59,621 --> 00:49:00,220
with,

1799
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:00,810
I think,

1800
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:01,270
uh,

1801
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:01,571
there,

1802
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:05,920
you build up a lot of stress when you're
pursuing something and a lot of that

1803
00:49:05,921 --> 00:49:07,990
stress can be evacuated physically.

1804
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:10,360
And that's what a lot of
people aren't aware of.

1805
00:49:10,361 --> 00:49:12,540
Like I goof around and,

1806
00:49:12,541 --> 00:49:13,151
and you know,

1807
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:14,340
and talk to people about,

1808
00:49:14,341 --> 00:49:14,680
uh,

1809
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,320
you know about yoga and
goof on yoga people.

1810
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:22,321
But Yoga is like a brilliant way of
managing your emotions and your body.

1811
00:49:23,321 --> 00:49:23,491
And,

1812
00:49:23,491 --> 00:49:25,720
and the idea of the word centered.

1813
00:49:25,721 --> 00:49:26,554
I hate the,

1814
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,370
I hate,

1815
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:28,690
I hate crystal talk.

1816
00:49:28,691 --> 00:49:29,524
You know what I'm saying?

1817
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,370
I hate,

1818
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:30,960
you know,

1819
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,550
well my yoga going on a retreat,

1820
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:36,580
there's a cleanse that's a
fucking teacher by the way.

1821
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:37,413
I hate crystal.

1822
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:38,710
I crystal talk.

1823
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,580
It drives me nuts.

1824
00:49:39,581 --> 00:49:40,090
I hate,

1825
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:42,190
I hate it when I know that it's a,

1826
00:49:42,191 --> 00:49:42,820
you're just,

1827
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:43,930
you've accepted this,

1828
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:46,000
this new age ideology,

1829
00:49:46,001 --> 00:49:46,241
this,

1830
00:49:46,241 --> 00:49:46,511
you know,

1831
00:49:46,511 --> 00:49:46,701
and,

1832
00:49:46,701 --> 00:49:49,270
and there's a lot of yoga talk
that goes along with that.

1833
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:52,180
But Yoga as a practice
is a brilliant practice.

1834
00:49:52,181 --> 00:49:53,560
It's fucking hard to do,

1835
00:49:53,561 --> 00:49:54,190
man.

1836
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:55,023
There's people that like,

1837
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,210
oh you're,

1838
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:57,063
you're working out.

1839
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:58,480
Oh you're doing yoga.

1840
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,250
That's not working out the fuck.

1841
00:50:00,251 --> 00:50:01,420
It's not man Yoga.

1842
00:50:01,421 --> 00:50:02,254
It's hard.

1843
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:06,190
Some of the worst ass kickings I've ever
had of Jujitsu was when I did yoga in

1844
00:50:06,191 --> 00:50:07,930
the morning and then do Jujitsu at night.

1845
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:08,171
Yeah.

1846
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:08,890
Cause your beat,

1847
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:09,790
I'm fucking beat.

1848
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:10,091
You know,

1849
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:10,390
I didn't,

1850
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:13,570
I did it like I don't like I can
fucking do yoga in the morning.

1851
00:50:13,571 --> 00:50:15,040
I'm not going to be tired for Jujitsu.

1852
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,360
Fucking not man.

1853
00:50:16,361 --> 00:50:20,710
Some of those poses are really difficult
and they're designed to like rain all

1854
00:50:20,711 --> 00:50:23,830
the stress out of your
body and they humble you.

1855
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,400
You walk out of there when you,

1856
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,590
when you have to go
through physical exertion,

1857
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:28,070
physical

1858
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:28,581
exertion,

1859
00:50:28,581 --> 00:50:30,260
like to the point where
your body's failing.

1860
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:31,490
That is very humbling,

1861
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:32,420
you know?

1862
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,920
And then when you get a speech at the end,

1863
00:50:33,921 --> 00:50:36,860
that's what I love about Yoga is you
get into child's pose where you're just

1864
00:50:36,861 --> 00:50:38,450
laying there and they talk to you,

1865
00:50:38,451 --> 00:50:38,661
man,

1866
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:39,740
I changed my life.

1867
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:40,790
Yeah,

1868
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:41,150
I was,

1869
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:41,620
I was,

1870
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:41,870
uh,

1871
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:43,310
in a relationship I wasn't happy with.

1872
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:44,840
This was probably 10 years ago,

1873
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,970
right before nine 11 or right after.

1874
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:47,870
Um,

1875
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:48,740
but is that area,

1876
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:50,030
and I was in a relationship.

1877
00:50:50,031 --> 00:50:50,601
I wasn't into,

1878
00:50:50,601 --> 00:50:51,680
I did not love her.

1879
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:52,550
I didn't even like her.

1880
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,150
And I was drinking a ton and I
was fucking as fat as I am now.

1881
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:56,990
But I mean,

1882
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:57,771
I've gotten back,

1883
00:50:57,771 --> 00:50:59,390
but I was as fat as I am now and I,

1884
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:02,900
and one morning I was up and I was just
fucking angry and depressed at like six

1885
00:51:02,901 --> 00:51:03,200
in the morning.

1886
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,820
My Buddy Corey called me and he was like,

1887
00:51:04,821 --> 00:51:04,971
Hey,

1888
00:51:04,971 --> 00:51:05,631
do you wanna go to yoga?

1889
00:51:05,631 --> 00:51:05,960
And I was like,

1890
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:06,410
Fuck Yoga,

1891
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:07,243
I'm not going to yoga.

1892
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:07,650
He goes,

1893
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:08,510
took good workout man,

1894
00:51:08,511 --> 00:51:09,344
you'll enjoy it.

1895
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:11,090
Did Yoga at the end of Yoga.

1896
00:51:11,091 --> 00:51:12,710
And I did every pose with integrity.

1897
00:51:12,711 --> 00:51:13,610
I like did them,

1898
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:18,050
I was sweating like a bitch laid down in
child's pose and this dude with fucking

1899
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:19,640
sleep and tattoos.

1900
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:23,330
Cool motherfucker like just walks
around in yoga pants and he's like,

1901
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,433
what?

1902
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:25,580
And he's talking to cross.

1903
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:27,530
What do you hate in your life today?

1904
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:28,760
What bothers you?

1905
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:31,160
And just because I'm exhausted,

1906
00:51:31,161 --> 00:51:32,030
I'm exhausted.

1907
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,500
I am tapped out physically.

1908
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:35,030
My brain just went fucking Rachel.

1909
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:36,620
And he goes,

1910
00:51:36,621 --> 00:51:37,670
you can change that.

1911
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:38,181
And I was like,

1912
00:51:38,181 --> 00:51:38,541
I can't,

1913
00:51:38,541 --> 00:51:39,021
it's too hard.

1914
00:51:39,021 --> 00:51:39,590
And he goes,

1915
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:40,970
decided to change that today,

1916
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,330
decide to make that decision
today and tomorrow will be better.

1917
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,680
You do that right now.

1918
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:46,670
And I was like,

1919
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:47,391
I guess I can bring up,

1920
00:51:47,391 --> 00:51:47,721
but there are any,

1921
00:51:47,721 --> 00:51:48,441
and then I just want to go,

1922
00:51:48,441 --> 00:51:49,310
yes you can,

1923
00:51:49,311 --> 00:51:49,851
you can do that.

1924
00:51:49,851 --> 00:51:50,450
And I was like,

1925
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:52,280
I could fucking break up with
her and like the dumbest thing,

1926
00:51:52,281 --> 00:51:52,491
I was like,

1927
00:51:52,491 --> 00:51:53,390
I'm gonna fucking break up with her,

1928
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:54,650
fucking bring up this bitch.

1929
00:51:54,651 --> 00:51:55,091
Fuck this.

1930
00:51:55,091 --> 00:51:56,430
And I called her glass.

1931
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:56,990
I was like,

1932
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:57,591
it's over it.

1933
00:51:57,591 --> 00:51:57,921
She was like,

1934
00:51:57,921 --> 00:51:58,311
what was like,

1935
00:51:58,311 --> 00:51:58,881
we should go to dinner,

1936
00:51:58,881 --> 00:51:59,760
let's talk click.

1937
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:00,550
But yeah,

1938
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:00,770
it was,

1939
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:02,410
and I fucking did it and went this chick,

1940
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:03,060
I was,

1941
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:03,290
no,

1942
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:05,640
I was dating her and we were like
dated for like a couple of years.

1943
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:06,733
We weren't living with them.

1944
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:06,951
No,

1945
00:52:06,951 --> 00:52:07,101
no,

1946
00:52:07,101 --> 00:52:07,281
no.

1947
00:52:07,281 --> 00:52:09,650
And so I got fucking broke
up with her literally.

1948
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:10,543
And I was like,

1949
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:13,190
the whole thing about
that one class was like,

1950
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:13,941
lose weight,

1951
00:52:13,941 --> 00:52:14,270
man.

1952
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:14,990
I can lose weight.

1953
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:16,220
I just know how to lose weight.

1954
00:52:16,221 --> 00:52:17,480
You just got to work out like a beast.

1955
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:18,440
Eat healthy.

1956
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,550
That's the way to lose weight.

1957
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:20,563
Fuck a book.

1958
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:21,590
So I started losing weight.

1959
00:52:21,591 --> 00:52:23,210
I got down to 185 pounds,

1960
00:52:23,211 --> 00:52:23,480
dude.

1961
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,650
I was a gangster.

1962
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:26,030
Brian,

1963
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:26,691
if you pull up my,

1964
00:52:26,691 --> 00:52:26,990
my,

1965
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:31,280
my Facebook page it on my fan Facebook
page at Burke Chrysler where I'm singing

1966
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:32,720
on the Joe,

1967
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:33,590
you'll see this.

1968
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:34,423
I'm Garret.

1969
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:38,060
I'm almost waiting for your reaction
of what you think I look like.

1970
00:52:38,061 --> 00:52:41,720
So you got super healthy and
fucking met my wife in a good place.

1971
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:43,190
Fucking fell in love.

1972
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:44,421
Changed my life.

1973
00:52:44,421 --> 00:52:46,220
I'm the happiest man in the world.

1974
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:48,050
And you think it's
attributable to that one?

1975
00:52:48,051 --> 00:52:51,060
One to fuck last breaking guys speech.

1976
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,040
The one dude man,

1977
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:52,700
one day.

1978
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:53,301
Isn't that funny?

1979
00:52:53,301 --> 00:52:53,690
Like,

1980
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:53,931
you know,

1981
00:52:53,931 --> 00:52:55,130
I hate that expression.

1982
00:52:55,131 --> 00:53:00,131
The wings of a butterfly can be the
first steps in and there's a hard cane.

1983
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:01,940
Yeah,

1984
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:02,661
there's many wings.

1985
00:53:02,661 --> 00:53:02,871
I mean,

1986
00:53:02,871 --> 00:53:03,704
my girlfriend,

1987
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,630
my girlfriend in college also fucked
my best friend and gave me the class.

1988
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:06,980
Yeah.

1989
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,570
So that what I know.

1990
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:10,520
So that's part of talk to me.

1991
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:11,150
What is this?

1992
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:12,620
She fucked my best when I was in Russia.

1993
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:13,970
She was fucking my best friend.

1994
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,771
Oh my God.

1995
00:53:14,771 --> 00:53:16,400
Who had the biggest dick in the world?

1996
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:17,653
Like I need to know that.

1997
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:19,431
Wow,

1998
00:53:19,431 --> 00:53:20,990
your best friend fucked your girlfriend.

1999
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:21,650
Yeah.

2000
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:26,010
And it happened to me in high school
and then they went to my graduation like

2001
00:53:26,011 --> 00:53:28,170
with his family or with her family.

2002
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:28,891
Brian,

2003
00:53:28,891 --> 00:53:29,701
go to my pictures.

2004
00:53:29,701 --> 00:53:30,660
I know you're all medically handbook.

2005
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:30,930
Yeah,

2006
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:34,950
go to my pictures on my fan page where
I'm singing on top of the Braves.

2007
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:35,401
Oh right.

2008
00:53:35,401 --> 00:53:36,060
Yeah,

2009
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:36,870
that's it.

2010
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:37,770
And you'll see no,

2011
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:39,060
no it did that page.

2012
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,370
And then just scroll through and
you'll see one of me shirtless.

2013
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:42,271
You'll go,

2014
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,590
are you fucking kidding me?

2015
00:53:43,591 --> 00:53:44,011
So,

2016
00:53:44,011 --> 00:53:44,610
um,

2017
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:46,350
so this was the wings of the butterfly.

2018
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:49,230
This turned you into one of the
many wings of the butterfly.

2019
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:49,641
You know,

2020
00:53:49,641 --> 00:53:51,660
you have a few uncomfortably dumb,

2021
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:52,740
but this was a big one.

2022
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:53,431
I don't know.

2023
00:53:53,431 --> 00:53:54,264
Brian,

2024
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:56,180
what were your wings?

2025
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:57,543
My wings.

2026
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,680
What does my wins?

2027
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,090
I'm like,

2028
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:04,590
give me some moments where you went,

2029
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:05,041
well,

2030
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,300
this is what I do for now on.

2031
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:08,071
I'm a,

2032
00:54:08,071 --> 00:54:08,904
I'm real good at

2033
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:09,830
commanding to shit.

2034
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:11,720
Like if I like to do something,

2035
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:16,780
I'm real good at like throwing my entire
brain at it and becoming obsessed with

2036
00:54:17,271 --> 00:54:17,630
it.

2037
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:19,040
It's probably not healthy.

2038
00:54:19,041 --> 00:54:22,430
It's probably like a
lot of success I think.

2039
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:24,640
And this is my belief about like,

2040
00:54:24,641 --> 00:54:24,860
uh,

2041
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:27,320
athletics that a lot of
success in athletics,

2042
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:29,990
it comes down to almost like a psychosis.

2043
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:30,741
You know,

2044
00:54:30,741 --> 00:54:35,720
like there's did like a and a
real high level of anything.

2045
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:37,310
There's a certain amount of,

2046
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:38,173
uh,

2047
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,480
almost crazy behavior to get to this
incredible position like a Michael Jordan

2048
00:54:43,521 --> 00:54:43,641
or,

2049
00:54:43,641 --> 00:54:44,050
uh,

2050
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:44,300
you know,

2051
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:44,840
or uh,

2052
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:45,171
you know,

2053
00:54:45,171 --> 00:54:46,700
or Muhammad Ali or you know,

2054
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:47,091
any,

2055
00:54:47,091 --> 00:54:49,880
any like elite highly
Mike Tyson in his prime.

2056
00:54:49,881 --> 00:54:50,490
And this,

2057
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:51,620
there's a madness,

2058
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,753
you know,

2059
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,070
and I,

2060
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,100
from the time that I was a kid,

2061
00:54:58,130 --> 00:54:59,630
I was involved in martial arts,

2062
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:00,650
so it wasn't like,

2063
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:03,050
it was like a choice that I
made when I was like 14 or 15.

2064
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:04,530
And that was a choice that I was on it.

2065
00:55:04,531 --> 00:55:06,140
So I was like 21 I know.

2066
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:11,230
But when I realized that I had to stop
fighting and stop teaching and just do

2067
00:55:13,761 --> 00:55:16,820
comedy was I was talking to a kid,

2068
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:17,870
his name is Jonathan.

2069
00:55:17,871 --> 00:55:19,010
I wish I remembered his last name,

2070
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:20,151
but we were open.

2071
00:55:20,151 --> 00:55:22,790
Miker is together about
six months in a comedy.

2072
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:26,690
I was still dabbling in it and I still
had my feet in all my other worlds trying

2073
00:55:26,691 --> 00:55:27,560
to find my place.

2074
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:31,330
And this dude who I'd done open
mikes with for like six months goes,

2075
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,810
you were really funny in the beginning.

2076
00:55:32,811 --> 00:55:33,290
But man,

2077
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:36,380
he just kind of petered out after a while

2078
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:37,920
really.

2079
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:38,491
And I was like,

2080
00:55:38,491 --> 00:55:38,790
wow.

2081
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:41,610
And I couldn't even say anything
because I knew he was right.

2082
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:42,743
Oh it was.

2083
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:43,561
Yeah.

2084
00:55:43,561 --> 00:55:44,550
I couldn't say anything.

2085
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,530
I couldn't say anything cause in my head,

2086
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:46,861
you know,

2087
00:55:46,861 --> 00:55:48,870
like if someone says you
don't work hard enough,

2088
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:49,290
my,

2089
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:51,660
my instinct is always to go fuck you.

2090
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,380
But I know as a person who's,

2091
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:56,490
you know,

2092
00:55:56,490 --> 00:56:00,230
benefited greatly from very
uncomfortable criticisms before,

2093
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,200
like some of the biggest growth moments
you can have was where someone just

2094
00:56:04,201 --> 00:56:07,260
knocked your dick into the dirt and
like she know what the fuck is a great

2095
00:56:07,261 --> 00:56:09,330
statement and then you step back.

2096
00:56:09,331 --> 00:56:11,460
And so I recognized early on to,

2097
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:12,031
you know,

2098
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:15,720
to be able to step back and objective
Lee obsessed when challenged like that.

2099
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,680
So it was when that guy said that I,

2100
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:18,900
I wanted to go,

2101
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,570
that's a dickhead thing to say
cause you know he was my friend,

2102
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,010
but I was,

2103
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:24,040
he's right.

2104
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:24,730
Oh,

2105
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:25,563
I couldn't say anything.

2106
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,050
So I said,

2107
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:26,681
this is it.

2108
00:56:26,681 --> 00:56:27,370
Fuck this.

2109
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:27,620
I'm,

2110
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:29,320
I'm a fucking professional comedian.

2111
00:56:29,321 --> 00:56:29,621
I'm not.

2112
00:56:29,621 --> 00:56:31,360
I'm not having one foot in the door.

2113
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:32,860
I closed down my school.

2114
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,780
I quit my job.

2115
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:36,380
Yeah.

2116
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:41,380
I was teaching taekwondo
at Boston University and I
had a a school in revere at

2117
00:56:41,591 --> 00:56:42,460
Nautilus plus.

2118
00:56:42,461 --> 00:56:43,690
That's per Chrysler scan.

2119
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:44,524
Bert Kreischer.

2120
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:45,071
Dude,

2121
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:46,230
you're a fucking animal

2122
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:48,723
Jujitsu studio.

2123
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,620
That's when I met my wife.

2124
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:51,580
That's incredible bro.

2125
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:53,620
I can't Bro.

2126
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:54,580
He was like a stud.

2127
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,190
You Go,

2128
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:56,110
you could choke somebody.

2129
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:57,780
I was a fucking monster nail.

2130
00:56:57,790 --> 00:56:59,050
You get double under hooks on May.

2131
00:56:59,060 --> 00:56:59,830
Look at you.

2132
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:00,370
Look at that.

2133
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:01,420
I was fucking gangster.

2134
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:02,201
If you want to see it.

2135
00:57:02,201 --> 00:57:03,190
It's on my Facebook,

2136
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:05,471
my Facebook page.

2137
00:57:05,471 --> 00:57:06,304
Brian,

2138
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:08,930
I don't know what the name,

2139
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:10,540
is it bird type his name.

2140
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:12,160
Just go to my Facebook page.

2141
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:12,491
Hey,

2142
00:57:12,491 --> 00:57:12,751
like me.

2143
00:57:12,751 --> 00:57:13,450
Why there?

2144
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:16,920
Why don't you just put that picture up
on your mirror and fucking get up to it

2145
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:17,650
hard.

2146
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:18,730
I'm really trying hard.

2147
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,570
You can do that.

2148
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:20,403
I'm trying hard man.

2149
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:20,861
Joe,

2150
00:57:20,861 --> 00:57:22,510
I'm not even fucking around.

2151
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:24,460
I have my fitbit.

2152
00:57:24,461 --> 00:57:26,470
I try to stay around 20,000 steps a day.

2153
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:27,220
I followed.

2154
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:27,641
That's right.

2155
00:57:27,641 --> 00:57:30,250
You have the crazy thing
in carrier fitbit scale.

2156
00:57:30,251 --> 00:57:33,610
Have you got Brian explained to people
if they don't know what the fitbit is

2157
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:34,811
fucking money.

2158
00:57:34,811 --> 00:57:35,330
Fitbit.

2159
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:36,163
You hear me?

2160
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:38,290
I talk about this thing
all the fucking time.

2161
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:39,220
I don't think they have any money,

2162
00:57:39,221 --> 00:57:39,550
dude.

2163
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:39,800
Oh,

2164
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,730
are you using it?

2165
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:45,240
And Tom Sara Bet did not updating it

2166
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:51,010
so I get,

2167
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:52,020
I got the fitbit.

2168
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:53,620
This fitbit is fucking,

2169
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:55,480
it counts your steps,

2170
00:57:55,481 --> 00:57:56,350
your calories,

2171
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:56,860
your,

2172
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:58,360
your flights of stairs you walk.

2173
00:57:58,361 --> 00:57:58,601
It's,

2174
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:00,220
it's the best thing
you put in your pocket.

2175
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,210
You just walk around with it.

2176
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:02,140
It just keeps you active.

2177
00:58:02,141 --> 00:58:02,590
It counts.

2178
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:03,670
You're coaching the other day.

2179
00:58:03,671 --> 00:58:08,500
So do you have a butterfly moment to
cost you to get a flip it a fitbit?

2180
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:12,340
You know what it was going to be dead
honest with you is I bought it and I was

2181
00:58:12,341 --> 00:58:12,880
kind of like,

2182
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:13,240
I was like,

2183
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:13,991
oh this is Kinda neat.

2184
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:14,920
And then I brought it here,

2185
00:58:14,921 --> 00:58:18,700
I guess I brought here or
to the other studios and um,

2186
00:58:18,701 --> 00:58:19,690
I had it and Brian was like,

2187
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,241
oh I'm gonna get one.

2188
00:58:20,241 --> 00:58:23,850
And then Brian got one and he emailed
me and he was like hip following you on

2189
00:58:23,851 --> 00:58:25,450
fitbit that moment I was like,

2190
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:25,901
fuck,

2191
00:58:25,901 --> 00:58:28,120
I can't let pride and I swear to you,

2192
00:58:28,121 --> 00:58:28,750
I started like,

2193
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:30,100
and then and then all this,

2194
00:58:30,101 --> 00:58:33,880
there was a desk squad page I guess and
they were all like fucking and I was

2195
00:58:33,881 --> 00:58:34,001
like,

2196
00:58:34,001 --> 00:58:34,780
I can't get going.

2197
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:35,740
Don't you guys do this?

2198
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,420
Would you both be interested
in getting in shape now

2199
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:42,131

2200
00:58:42,131 --> 00:58:42,341
Let me,

2201
00:58:42,341 --> 00:58:43,270
I'm going to be really honest.

2202
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:45,370
If you don't get your life in order now,

2203
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,740
you're going to fucking
pay for it when you're 39.

2204
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:49,090
Yeah,

2205
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:50,260
that's only a year away.

2206
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:53,110
I know that's not sort of
talking about start it today.

2207
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:53,701
Like I've,

2208
00:58:53,701 --> 00:58:56,890
I'm trying to fix my life health wise now.

2209
00:58:57,150 --> 00:59:00,460
Well that's certainly good
because you know it's going to end

2210
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:03,220
the last years,

2211
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:03,581
you know,

2212
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,500
depending on how much
you're poisoning it now,

2213
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:08,920
depends on how well it's going to work
and allows you to feel so fucking good.

2214
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:10,180
What's poison feels good for you?

2215
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:11,050
All of them.

2216
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:11,920
Plus alcohol.

2217
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:13,670
What I'm trying to cut,

2218
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:13,970
I'm cutting.

2219
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:15,520
My drink has been cut back a lot.

2220
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:18,060
You know what else is it?

2221
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:19,010
Yup.

2222
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:19,570
Yup.

2223
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:20,590
People listen to this Joe.

2224
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:20,930
Oh,

2225
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:21,763
that's right.

2226
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,470
You're not a fucking real podcast.

2227
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,880
You're fucking this podcast.

2228
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:26,421
Yeah.

2229
00:59:26,421 --> 00:59:28,100
Those other podcasts are pussies.

2230
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:28,971
I can fucking talk.

2231
00:59:28,971 --> 00:59:31,190
I can say I go do some
podcasts and I'll look for it.

2232
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,240
I'll tell you anything you want.

2233
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:33,493
No one's here this.

2234
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:36,553
I was like,

2235
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,520
that's fucking bad.

2236
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:37,701
Well,

2237
00:59:37,701 --> 00:59:38,421
I don't think that,

2238
00:59:38,421 --> 00:59:40,660
I think any podcasts he gets
on the Internet it's going to,

2239
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:41,421
but you know,

2240
00:59:41,421 --> 00:59:42,530
in this podcast you man,

2241
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:44,600
you can't not pay up
moments on this podcast.

2242
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:46,280
I talked about shit and I'm like,

2243
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:47,571
and then you lay in bed.

2244
00:59:47,571 --> 00:59:47,950
You're like,

2245
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:50,990
it's not like this is Joe and
his friends listening to it.

2246
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:54,500
This is Joe and fucking a lot.

2247
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:55,430
Okay,

2248
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:56,091
let's do this.

2249
00:59:56,091 --> 00:59:56,570
Okay.

2250
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:58,220
And he just let it swing.

2251
00:59:58,550 --> 00:59:59,240
Let's do this.

2252
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:03,170
Let's celebrate bottle
on a diet or something.

2253
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:03,830
I'm on a diet.

2254
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:07,730
Chevon doesn't count d I'm hiding
behind the campaigns like party stuff.

2255
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:08,420
Um,

2256
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:08,991
so,

2257
01:00:08,991 --> 01:00:10,520
and the reason hardy stuff,

2258
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:10,960
yeah,

2259
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:11,690
it's fine.

2260
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:12,920
Grocery get on Sundays.

2261
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:13,910
Oh,

2262
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:14,743
come on.

2263
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:15,231
They do.

2264
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:16,400
They have mimosas.

2265
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:17,253
Yeah.

2266
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,370
So this is what,

2267
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,313
uh,

2268
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:21,290
this is what we're celebrating.

2269
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:22,150
Okay.

2270
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:25,370
And I say this and I say
this in connection with what
I was just saying and I've

2271
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,810
said this to a number of times.

2272
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:30,660
I've said this to so many times that I
have stopped saying it and I've thought a

2273
01:00:30,661 --> 01:00:30,981
lot.

2274
01:00:30,981 --> 01:00:33,980
And it's the reason I don't call
sometimes when I want to thank you.

2275
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:35,200
But,

2276
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:35,490
uh,

2277
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:38,720
this podcast has been life
changing for a bunch of us.

2278
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:42,080
I think a lot of us that have
done this had been fantastic.

2279
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:45,500
This has been one of the
greatest experiences of our
lives or our professional

2280
01:00:45,501 --> 01:00:46,334
careers.

2281
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,590
And because of this podcast,

2282
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:50,263
your boy

2283
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,233
wrote a book.

2284
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:54,230
You wrote a book.

2285
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:55,250
I've got a book deal son.

2286
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:56,263
Wow.

2287
01:00:56,860 --> 01:01:00,020
Book deals coming out in the year and
then just because of this podcast.

2288
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:00,480
Wow.

2289
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:04,910
And it is like one of my coolest life
achievements ever and it's something I'm

2290
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:05,960
so proud of.

2291
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:06,681
It is.

2292
01:01:06,681 --> 01:01:11,681
It is something I will dedicate this
next year to it more than anything I'm

2293
01:01:12,231 --> 01:01:12,831
working on.

2294
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,071
That's,

2295
01:01:13,071 --> 01:01:13,251

01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,001
I appreciate that.

2311
01:01:36,001 --> 01:01:36,681
And it's beautiful.

2312
01:01:36,681 --> 01:01:40,880
It's awesome to hear word but it
wouldn't have mean meant anything if you

2313
01:01:40,881 --> 01:01:41,714
weren't talented.

2314
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:43,970
I do see that.

2315
01:01:43,971 --> 01:01:46,550
I appreciate that because I've
said this to a number of times,

2316
01:01:46,551 --> 01:01:48,380
but man distinctly this,

2317
01:01:48,381 --> 01:01:49,214
uh,

2318
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:53,120
I mean the whole reason the whole
thing came up is this fucking podcast.

2319
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:56,060
Like I went to New York and people had
heard this podcast and they were like,

2320
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:56,960
hey man,

2321
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,820
I heard that machine
story on Joe's podcast.

2322
01:01:58,821 --> 01:01:59,654
Can you do a book?

2323
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:00,780
And this is the,

2324
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:04,360
that from your podcasts that tape
got passed to all look at it.

2325
01:02:04,361 --> 01:02:09,361
Another way of looking at it is how
lucky am I that I get to be on a podcast

2326
01:02:09,711 --> 01:02:10,101
with guys?

2327
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:13,490
Like you have such great stories that
make people on tune in and listen again

2328
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:14,930
cause your egos in check.

2329
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,760
That's fucking really
sweet of you to say Joe.

2330
01:02:16,761 --> 01:02:17,860
But I will genuinely,

2331
01:02:18,550 --> 01:02:20,040
it's not that I me to say that

2332
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,330
it's 100% how I feel.

2333
01:02:21,331 --> 01:02:22,600
I think we're,

2334
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:23,520
we're all real lucky.

2335
01:02:23,521 --> 01:02:23,791
You know,

2336
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:25,710
this podcast has been a lot of fun.

2337
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:27,090
It's,

2338
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:27,923
it's,

2339
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:28,651
it's,

2340
01:02:28,651 --> 01:02:33,090
we got a connection with people that
we never thought would take place,

2341
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:33,871
you know,

2342
01:02:33,871 --> 01:02:36,780
and I respect it and I
know Brian respects it and,

2343
01:02:36,781 --> 01:02:37,081
and I,

2344
01:02:37,081 --> 01:02:39,480
and I know the people that go on the show,

2345
01:02:39,481 --> 01:02:40,140
they,

2346
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:40,800
that we,

2347
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,090
we're all aware that this is,

2348
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:43,260
this is really cool.

2349
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:46,130
We're all railed aware
that we have like cool,

2350
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:46,930
we have like a,

2351
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:51,800
it's like the impact of like a regular
show and yet you could just film it out

2352
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:53,010
of my fucked up office,

2353
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:53,630
you know?

2354
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:54,080
To me

2355
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,220
it's a bizarre,

2356
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:55,940
it's like,

2357
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:59,090
it's like showing up to San
Francisco when the first dude's like,

2358
01:02:59,210 --> 01:02:59,541
hey man,

2359
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:00,440
can you guys keep a secret?

2360
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:01,813
It's fun,

2361
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:02,151
you know,

2362
01:03:02,151 --> 01:03:03,180
and the connection with people,

2363
01:03:03,181 --> 01:03:07,100
like we did a show last night at the
ice house and it was fucking amazing.

2364
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:07,881
It's incredible.

2365
01:03:07,881 --> 01:03:08,930
The place is packed.

2366
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:09,420
We,

2367
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:09,720
we,

2368
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,170
we sold it out on like one day's notice.

2369
01:03:12,171 --> 01:03:12,350
You know,

2370
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:13,820
we just said we're going
to do a show there.

2371
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:17,030
And it was mobbed with the
coolest fucking people.

2372
01:03:17,031 --> 01:03:18,440
How bad ass was that chair last night,

2373
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:19,293
Brian?

2374
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:20,420
It's fucking awesome.

2375
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:21,300
Amazing.

2376
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,970
That's audiences every Wednesday night.

2377
01:03:22,971 --> 01:03:23,930
A late night show too.

2378
01:03:23,931 --> 01:03:25,280
We did a 10:00 PM show,

2379
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:25,731
didn't,

2380
01:03:25,731 --> 01:03:25,911
you know,

2381
01:03:25,911 --> 01:03:27,810
didn't even get started to like 10 30 it.

2382
01:03:27,811 --> 01:03:29,990
We're totally changing that
whole entire ice house.

2383
01:03:29,991 --> 01:03:30,161
We're,

2384
01:03:30,161 --> 01:03:34,070
we're bringing that fucking club back
because I mean a lot of the comics last

2385
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:35,780
night said I used like Doug Benson,

2386
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,820
I used to love coming to the ice house,

2387
01:03:37,821 --> 01:03:40,730
but then something weird happened and
it just like that and I get started

2388
01:03:40,731 --> 01:03:43,910
getting kind of different and it
wasn't that fun to go to anymore.

2389
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:44,271
It's like,

2390
01:03:44,271 --> 01:03:45,650
but like tonight he's like,

2391
01:03:45,651 --> 01:03:47,120
that was one of the funniest times ever.

2392
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:49,130
The best crowds we've ever had ever.

2393
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:50,073
And it's,

2394
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:52,730
it's almost like hard to believe.

2395
01:03:52,731 --> 01:03:55,190
You would assume that you know,

2396
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:58,070
you don't think that people have
really have different crowds.

2397
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:59,540
You don't think that people like bring,

2398
01:03:59,541 --> 01:04:00,111
you know what I mean?

2399
01:04:00,111 --> 01:04:00,531
You feel like,

2400
01:04:00,531 --> 01:04:04,010
well Chicago is different than New
York in New York is different than San

2401
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:04,340
Francisco.

2402
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,660
But what's been,

2403
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:09,050
what's changed recently for
us is that everywhere we go,

2404
01:04:09,051 --> 01:04:11,150
the crowds have been amazing.

2405
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:15,140
Like really nice people like really
enthusiastic and you got to go,

2406
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,940
how the fuck does that happen?

2407
01:04:16,941 --> 01:04:18,560
Like how can you pull that off?

2408
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:21,800
Like what is no one ever thought that
there was a formula for doing that.

2409
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:25,430
No one ever thought that there was a
formula where you could go and ensure that

2410
01:04:25,431 --> 01:04:30,431
you would have a huge percentage of the
population that kind of thinks along the

2411
01:04:30,681 --> 01:04:33,050
same way that you think
would be nice to people.

2412
01:04:33,051 --> 01:04:33,890
Be Generous,

2413
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,420
but you're making me over.

2414
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:37,050
Think about the way you think though.

2415
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:37,851
Can you imagine it?

2416
01:04:37,851 --> 01:04:39,960
You've found those
people like when you go,

2417
01:04:39,961 --> 01:04:40,231
hey,

2418
01:04:40,231 --> 01:04:41,610
the the blue collar comedy tour,

2419
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:42,331
they found each other.

2420
01:04:42,331 --> 01:04:43,164
We'll know shit.

2421
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:44,850
Like,

2422
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:45,571
can you imagine that?

2423
01:04:45,571 --> 01:04:47,010
A bunch of people that are into Dmt,

2424
01:04:47,011 --> 01:04:49,590
mushrooms and I'm a fucking spiritual,

2425
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,480
like vitamins being healthy,

2426
01:04:51,481 --> 01:04:53,880
like all those people just showed
up at once and you're like,

2427
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:55,290
shut the fuck up.

2428
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:56,643
Love comedy.

2429
01:04:57,020 --> 01:04:58,860
Love good fucking friends,

2430
01:04:58,980 --> 01:04:59,970
good stories.

2431
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:01,080
Enjoying each other.

2432
01:05:01,081 --> 01:05:03,790
Like there's a comradery that is this,

2433
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:04,723
this network.

2434
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:06,820
Everybody likes good comedy,

2435
01:05:06,821 --> 01:05:07,060
Matt.

2436
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:08,470
I think unless you're a con too.

2437
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:08,810
Yeah,

2438
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:09,850
you liked good comedy.

2439
01:05:09,851 --> 01:05:10,620
Unless you like,

2440
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:12,700
can I just don't funny unless
you're one of those asshole.

2441
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,060
Some people enjoy bad guy,

2442
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:15,120
some people enjoy counted.

2443
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:15,993
It's not good.

2444
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,100
Like everyone that I've
heard on your podcast,

2445
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:19,630
I don't think I will.

2446
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:22,880
I don't think there's one exception is
a comic that I would fucking pay to see.

2447
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:24,310
Genuinely.

2448
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,720
That's a large statement.

2449
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:27,960
And when you had dom Arrera yeah,

2450
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:29,103
that's like a,

2451
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:29,820
that's like a,

2452
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:30,510
and he's,

2453
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:31,343
so,

2454
01:05:31,580 --> 01:05:32,590
he's not a Olympus,

2455
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:35,650
but he's like one of the gods that
deals with like traffic or whatever.

2456
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:36,290
Like he's uh,

2457
01:05:36,290 --> 01:05:39,000
one of the fucking 12 gods
and it's a great comment.

2458
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:42,940
His podcast I listen to on repeat when
I was in Boston because I was in Boston

2459
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:43,541
and I was like,

2460
01:05:43,541 --> 01:05:43,661
oh,

2461
01:05:43,661 --> 01:05:44,231
I'm going to bed.

2462
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:46,000
I'll listen to Dom's over and over.

2463
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:47,411
God,

2464
01:05:47,411 --> 01:05:47,950
man,

2465
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:49,120
he was on Tuesday too.

2466
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:52,600
He did Tuesday to monster man.

2467
01:05:52,601 --> 01:05:53,480
Like everyone,

2468
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:53,951
I couldn't,

2469
01:05:53,951 --> 01:05:55,230
you couldn't name one comic there.

2470
01:05:55,570 --> 01:05:56,500
I will say I will,

2487
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,840
You know how Dunkin's brainworks and

2488
01:06:25,841 --> 01:06:25,961

We get some cigars in here.

2499
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:33,941

01:06:42,201 --> 01:06:42,530
man.

2507
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:43,610
We're all very fortunate.

2508
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:44,391
You know,

2509
01:06:44,391 --> 01:06:44,601
it's,

2510
01:06:44,601 --> 01:06:45,170
uh,

2511
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:46,430
it's been really interesting.

2512
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:47,421
It's like,

2513
01:06:47,421 --> 01:06:48,254

2514
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:49,040
you know,

2515
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:52,040

did like these little things called Joe

2516
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:53,390

2517
01:06:53,391 --> 01:06:53,750

videos of everywhere,

2519
01:06:54,951 --> 01:06:55,670

2520
01:06:55,670 --> 01:06:55,801
going,

2521
01:06:55,801 --> 01:06:57,890
go call out Jenna Jamison
via Paul being a whore.

2522
01:06:58,370 --> 01:06:58,521
No,

2523
01:06:58,521 --> 01:06:59,354
I did not.

2524
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:00,670
Oh No,

2525
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:02,490
I was in Nigeria.

2526
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:05,720
Jenna Jamison is nice.

2527
01:07:05,810 --> 01:07:07,520
I've never called her
out for being a whore.

2528
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:08,383
How dare you?

2529
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:09,620
She's a nice lady.

2530
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:10,040
Okay.

2531
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:10,910
What'd you get this from?

2532
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:11,280
Oh my God.

2533
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,130
Remember that you're confusing me.

2534
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:13,731
I swear to God.

2535
01:07:13,731 --> 01:07:14,610
Joe Show you ran into gym,

2536
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:15,920

2538
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:16,460
No,

2539
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:17,293

2540
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:18,500
no.

2541
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:19,333
Wait,

2542
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:24,440
it was Jenna Jamison explaining to me.

2543
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,191
Oh,

2544
01:07:25,191 --> 01:07:26,024
to eat pussy.

2545
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:27,293
She's teaching.

2546
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:30,910
Don't calling around to Jameson's.

2547
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:31,191
Cool.

2548
01:07:31,191 --> 01:07:31,780
We liked Genentech.

2549
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:32,031
Yeah,

2550
01:07:32,031 --> 01:07:32,721
she's very cool.

2551
01:07:32,721 --> 01:07:33,710
She's a very nice lady.

2552
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:34,790
You know,

2553
01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:36,020
she was not her,

2554
01:07:36,021 --> 01:07:36,250
but,

2555
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:36,710
um,

2556
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:38,210
Ginger Lynn was on,

2557
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,073
um,

2558
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:39,943
uh,

2559
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:43,070
David tells show last night I did
David tell show Dave's old porn.

2560
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:44,650
That's a fucking fun child,

2561
01:07:44,651 --> 01:07:45,320
man.

2562
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:45,591
Really?

2563
01:07:45,591 --> 01:07:46,424
If you ever done it?

2564
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,353
No.

2565
01:07:47,890 --> 01:07:48,723
Why do you laugh?

2566
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:49,873
You could do it.

2567
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:51,621
I can definitely do it.

2568
01:07:51,621 --> 01:07:52,250
But you know,

2569
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:53,620
it's like Dave David Tell,

2570
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:53,981
you know,

2571
01:07:53,981 --> 01:07:54,680
it's not like he's,

2572
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,510
he's calling his buddies
Scott and you stand up.

2573
01:07:56,511 --> 01:07:57,920
He's called his friends
is not going to call.

2574
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,510
He's like into a casting call for it,

2575
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:02,060
but I think he would love to
deal with any kind of comics.

2576
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:03,600
I'd love to do with Dave and I.

2577
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:04,453
That would be,

2578
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:08,240
that's my feelings when
you go down to yourself,

2579
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:10,140
you sweetie,

2580
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:10,701
cue the music.

2581
01:08:10,701 --> 01:08:11,141
But anyway,

2582
01:08:11,141 --> 01:08:11,510
yeah.

2583
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:11,750
You know,

2584
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:14,840
just to be sitting there with
Dave Rifkin on guys getting coke.

2585
01:08:15,610 --> 01:08:16,550
It was really fun.

2586
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:17,473
It was really fun.

2587
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:18,583
And then um,

2588
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,330
Ginger Lynn came on,

2589
01:08:20,950 --> 01:08:21,771
she watched,

2590
01:08:21,771 --> 01:08:22,640
watched their videos.

2591
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:23,483
Old School.

2592
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:23,811
Yeah.

2593
01:08:23,811 --> 01:08:24,910
She's one of the,

2594
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:28,430
the the originators and
the Mount Rushmore porn.

2595
01:08:28,431 --> 01:08:29,264
She's right up.

2596
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:30,391
So if you could do,

2597
01:08:30,391 --> 01:08:31,410
if you could do a tour,

2598
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:32,010
right?

2599
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:32,790
Dream Tour.

2600
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:36,570
No money has no money is
involved you and three comics.

2601
01:08:36,810 --> 01:08:39,090
Three you're equals not
like you can't bring Joey.

2602
01:08:39,091 --> 01:08:39,390
I'm not,

2603
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:40,530
not to judge that you're equal,

2604
01:08:40,670 --> 01:08:43,920
but I'm talking like three
fucking big name draws.

2605
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,353
Who would it be?

2606
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:46,530
I wouldn't do that.

2607
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:49,010
You have to.

2608
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:50,640
You have a gun pointed at your bowl.

2609
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,860
It's like guys that I
would want to work with.

2610
01:08:53,370 --> 01:08:55,110
I would love to do a tour.

2611
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:55,670
Okay.

2612
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:57,080
I would love to do Stan hope.

2613
01:08:57,081 --> 01:08:59,960
Norton me and who else want cheese?

2614
01:09:00,510 --> 01:09:04,200
I is one of the amazing
monster show that would,

2615
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:04,681
yeah.

2616
01:09:04,681 --> 01:09:06,630
Tell him I have talked about
doing some stuff together.

2617
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:07,800
We should totally do that.

2618
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:11,890
Me a towel and stand up would be a
lot of fun on the road to Oh God.

2619
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:12,750
Yeah.

2620
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:12,991
Well,

2621
01:09:12,991 --> 01:09:13,381

he's so super successful right now.

2626
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:18,210
He's so busy with his own stuff.

2627
01:09:18,211 --> 01:09:19,530
I don't think he has time to do anything.

2628
01:09:19,950 --> 01:09:21,720
He'd redesigning the
entertainment business.

2629
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:22,021

Got To do shit.

2639
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:38,910
I sent him an email asking
them to do the podcast.

2640
01:09:38,911 --> 01:09:40,590
He said he would someday
when he gets time,

2641
01:09:40,591 --> 01:09:40,921
but I,

2642
01:09:40,921 --> 01:09:41,340
you know,

2643
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:42,173
I'm not pushing it.

2644
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:42,420
He's,

2645
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:43,410
that guy's busy as fuck.

2646
01:09:43,770 --> 01:09:46,800
I love having a guy like that out there.

2647
01:09:46,801 --> 01:09:48,360
I think it's very inspirational,

2648
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:48,750
Huh?

2649
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:49,380
Yeah.

2650
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:54,330
He inspires me the most of them and
any comedian and not even like material

2651
01:09:54,331 --> 01:09:55,080
wise.

2652
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:57,330
If I had to choose between a guy
that makes me the laugh the hardest,

2653
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:58,183
it's Stanhope.

2654
01:09:58,510 --> 01:10:01,590
Stan hopes new fucking CD before
he turns the gun on himself.

2655
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:01,850
Yeah,

2656
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:02,700
it's great.

2657
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:04,640
Maybe my maybe like,

2658
01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:05,930
oh and I'll put this up there.

2659
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:07,063
Uh,

2660
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:07,700
Patrice is,

2661
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:08,540
last city was great,

2662
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:10,910
but Patrice is our special
elephant in the room.

2663
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:11,080
Oh,

2664
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:12,350
it's fucking awesome.

2665
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:12,501
Yeah,

2666
01:10:12,501 --> 01:10:13,310
that was really good.

2667
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:14,810
And Stan hope CD.

2668
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,400
I bought it myself.

2669
01:10:16,401 --> 01:10:21,000
I purchased it as a consumer and I fucking
listen to it and I was laughing out

2670
01:10:21,001 --> 01:10:21,161
loud.

2671
01:10:21,161 --> 01:10:21,470
Loudness,

2672
01:10:21,470 --> 01:10:22,640
not what my wife likes,

2673
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:23,870
but I had to,

2674
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:24,680
I was like,

2675
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:25,513
I got a tester.

2676
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:28,070
I got to bring her in the room and let
her hear this track cause it's that

2677
01:10:28,071 --> 01:10:28,780
fucking funny.

2678
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:29,451
And he's a monster.

2679
01:10:29,451 --> 01:10:30,700
He's in town right now or as,

2680
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:32,690
or it was yesterday or the day.

2681
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:32,961
Yeah.

2682
01:10:32,961 --> 01:10:33,570
Oh that's right.

2683
01:10:33,570 --> 01:10:34,470
Did Dave show?

2684
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:34,950
Yeah,

2685
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:35,281
I got it.

2686
01:10:35,281 --> 01:10:36,114
I got to call him up.

2687
01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:38,850
Who wants to fucking get behind Gary,

2688
01:10:38,851 --> 01:10:40,050
whatever the fuck his name is,

2689
01:10:40,051 --> 01:10:41,160
the guy from New Mexico,

2690
01:10:41,190 --> 01:10:42,900
former governor of New Mexico.

2691
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:46,420
Then there were some
standout stories that I tell.

2692
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:48,130
He was really crazy.

2693
01:10:48,910 --> 01:10:49,090
Oh.

2694
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:51,690
Sitting with a group of um,

2695
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:53,110
shit,

2696
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:53,650
this would be so,

2697
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:54,000
oh,

2698
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,960
stupid was sitting with a group of chefs,

2699
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:57,191
Gary Johnson,

2700
01:10:57,191 --> 01:10:57,521
sorry.

2701
01:10:57,521 --> 01:11:01,300
That's who Stan hope wants to get
behind or similar group of chefs at a,

2702
01:11:01,301 --> 01:11:05,980
at a restaurant called camp and Nelly
on Labrea and they were talking about,

2703
01:11:06,010 --> 01:11:06,880
they were talking about food.

2704
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:10,210
They're talking about this great
restaurant on Fairfax called animal.

2705
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:11,073
Have you ever been there?

2706
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,580
He was just talking about it apparently.

2707
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:13,980
It's like best,

2708
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:14,701
I've never been there.

2709
01:11:14,701 --> 01:11:15,331
I'd love to go.

2710
01:11:15,331 --> 01:11:16,111
It's amazing.

2711
01:11:16,111 --> 01:11:19,410
I they have everything
they have like veal brains.

2712
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,273
They have,

2713
01:11:20,990 --> 01:11:22,260
it's kind of expensive though,

2714
01:11:22,261 --> 01:11:23,580
but I'd heard it's great.

2715
01:11:23,581 --> 01:11:27,880
So they're talking about like gossip
about food and what good food places

2716
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:28,680
already eat.

2717
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:29,820
And then I said to them,

2718
01:11:29,821 --> 01:11:30,121
I was like,

2719
01:11:30,121 --> 01:11:30,750
this is really cool.

2720
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:33,330
It's like being in the green room of
a comedy club and listen to what your

2721
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:33,841
headliners.

2722
01:11:33,841 --> 01:11:36,330
Talk about what comic
I should look out for.

2723
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:37,111
And they were like,

2724
01:11:37,111 --> 01:11:38,460
well what comics should we look out for?

2725
01:11:38,461 --> 01:11:38,791
And I was like,

2726
01:11:38,791 --> 01:11:40,080
that's a fucking horrible question.

2727
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:41,080
So I don't even know who are,

2728
01:11:41,090 --> 01:11:42,130
who you guys like.

2729
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,010
And one of the guys goes,

2730
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,070
we love Doug Stanhope.

2731
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:46,200
And I was like,

2732
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:49,800
I didn't see that coming just
because during the corporate world,

2733
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:50,723
you know what I mean?

2734
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:51,631
And I was like,

2735
01:11:51,631 --> 01:11:51,961
really?

2736
01:11:51,961 --> 01:11:52,261
And they're like,

2737
01:11:52,261 --> 01:11:52,501
man,

2738
01:11:52,501 --> 01:11:53,610
his last special when we talk,

2739
01:11:53,611 --> 01:11:55,680
who likes to be in the corporate world,

2740
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:59,380
how many people are in there
that are enjoying that a lot?

2741
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,260
That's just where they're at.

2742
01:12:01,290 --> 01:12:02,123
They're stuck,

2743
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:02,900
you know?

2744
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:04,680
That's what a shitty existence.

2745
01:12:04,710 --> 01:12:05,280
I would never,

2746
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,500
the weirdest thing
about our whole society,

2747
01:12:07,501 --> 01:12:10,620
our whole culture is in order for
it to work the way it is right now,

2748
01:12:10,621 --> 01:12:14,520
we can go to the store and buy a fucking
soda and getting a car and just turn

2749
01:12:14,521 --> 01:12:15,270
the key and drive it.

2750
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:20,250
Someone has to do some shit that they
don't want it everywhere has got to take

2751
01:12:20,251 --> 01:12:22,090
it on the Chin every fucking morning.

2752
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:26,970
He got to recognize that unless they can
figure out how to make robots that do

2753
01:12:26,971 --> 01:12:27,804
everything.

2754
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:28,501
And then even that,

2755
01:12:28,501 --> 01:12:31,590
are you really going to find a guy
that wants to program that robot to do

2756
01:12:31,591 --> 01:12:34,950
everything or is it going to be a
job that he has to do and it sucks?

2757
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:35,850
I mean,

2758
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:38,790
there's no way that everybody could
live the life of Bert Kreischer.

2759
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:39,960
It's not possible.

2760
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,880
Someone's got to be out there huffing it.

2761
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:43,980
Bert ditches need to be dug,

2762
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:46,913
right?

2763
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:47,570
Yeah.

2764
01:12:47,570 --> 01:12:47,971
Some of it,

2765
01:12:47,971 --> 01:12:49,390
someone's got to dig a fucking Ninja.

2766
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:50,150
I,

2767
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:55,150
I genuinely look up to those guys
who bill fences sometimes cause I go,

2768
01:12:55,530 --> 01:12:55,711
look,

2769
01:12:55,711 --> 01:12:57,780
I'm not shitting on my existence at all.

2770
01:12:57,781 --> 01:12:59,130
I'm not saying that I have it hard,

2771
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:01,080
but sometimes I do miss
my family and I go,

2772
01:13:01,081 --> 01:13:01,411
man,

2773
01:13:01,411 --> 01:13:02,190
like I don't have a choice.

2774
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:04,230
I have to go to Scotland for two weeks.

2775
01:13:04,330 --> 01:13:07,860
That's great gig to go to Scotland for
two weeks or go to Italy for two weeks,

2776
01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:09,810
back to back with three days off.

2777
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:10,560
But it's,

2778
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:11,101
it does suck.

2779
01:13:11,101 --> 01:13:11,934
You Miss Your family.

2780
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:14,700
And some days you look at the guy
building the fence and you're like,

2781
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:16,830
Macy's is kids every fucking morning.

2782
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:18,143
And he's like,

2783
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:19,450
and no one gives them notes on his,

2784
01:13:19,970 --> 01:13:20,850
his fans like,

2785
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:21,521
hey man,

2786
01:13:21,521 --> 01:13:23,970
you gotta like do it
this way a little bit.

2787
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:25,530
Are you getting that from your show?

2788
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,090
You get notes and like what to do?

2789
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:27,451
Oh,

2790
01:13:27,451 --> 01:13:27,811
of course.

2791
01:13:27,811 --> 01:13:28,290
All the time.

2792
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:28,531
I mean,

2793
01:13:28,531 --> 01:13:28,731
yeah,

2794
01:13:28,731 --> 01:13:29,564
it was an annoying,

2795
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:30,180
uh,

2796
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:30,430
I'm,

2797
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:30,660
I'm,

2798
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:32,040
you know what I am,

2799
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:32,820
I should,

2800
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:36,510
I should write a book about how to
get through the corporate world of

2801
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,344
television.

2802
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:41,460
Like not famous television but making
television and just be cool with it.

2803
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:42,540
Cause I get it,

2804
01:13:42,541 --> 01:13:42,781
man.

2805
01:13:42,781 --> 01:13:44,250
I totally fucking get it.

2806
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:45,750
I get when they go,

2807
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:46,740
we need more information.

2808
01:13:46,741 --> 01:13:47,510
I go,

2809
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:48,343
I,

2810
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:49,253
I'm not the,

2811
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:52,500
despite the fact that we're
not making comedy though,

2812
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:56,330
the grossest things when you're making
comedy and you get the notes like I,

2813
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:58,620
it was way easier for me to,

2814
01:13:58,770 --> 01:13:59,101
you know,

2815
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:02,040
to have a bunch of people that have
a bunch of different opinions on how

2816
01:14:02,041 --> 01:14:03,570
something should be done on fear factor.

2817
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:06,640
And it would be if they were
trying to deconstruct my stand up.

2818
01:14:07,430 --> 01:14:08,190
When you start,

2819
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:10,290
if you've done a comedy central special,

2820
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,070
did you have to over
your material with them?

2821
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:13,270
Yeah.

2822
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:14,103
Yeah.

2823
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:15,220
How'd that go and not?

2824
01:14:15,221 --> 01:14:15,581
Well,

2825
01:14:15,581 --> 01:14:16,150
I had to do it.

2826
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:16,781
I had to do too.

2827
01:14:16,781 --> 01:14:19,060
I want the first one I
had to do pat buckles.

2828
01:14:19,061 --> 01:14:20,140
I had to go over it with her,

2829
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,030
like she read it back to me.

2830
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:23,170
Oh Jesus Christ.

2831
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:27,130
Fucking and I'm about to go onstage and
not one laugh like silence because I'm

2832
01:14:27,131 --> 01:14:28,060
not coming out of my shit.

2833
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:29,410
She doesn't understand it.

2834
01:14:29,470 --> 01:14:30,303
Of course.

2835
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:31,323
No laugh.

2836
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:32,553
Why would she laugh at you?

2837
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:33,210
Yeah.

2838
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:34,270
Who was a nice person,

2839
01:14:34,271 --> 01:14:35,380
but he just was like,

2840
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:36,150
she was like,

2841
01:14:36,150 --> 01:14:37,420
card the groove though.

2842
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:39,300
I'll never forget her first thing was,

2843
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:39,581
all right,

2844
01:14:39,581 --> 01:14:40,090
so let's do it.

2845
01:14:40,090 --> 01:14:41,440
My name is Bert and everything in hot,

2846
01:14:41,441 --> 01:14:42,610
sexy name Bert,

2847
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:42,821
Bert,

2848
01:14:42,821 --> 01:14:44,830
Bert and I go,

2849
01:14:44,831 --> 01:14:45,400
Yep.

2850
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:45,700
He goes,

2851
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:46,533
okay.

2852
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:47,650
Uh,

2853
01:14:47,670 --> 01:14:49,970
where all the bitches that
right is that you are.

2854
01:14:50,010 --> 01:14:50,550
Here we go.

2855
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:51,100
All right,

2856
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:51,851
we're going to take pitches off.

2857
01:14:51,851 --> 01:14:52,390
Can you change that?

2858
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:52,700
Sure.

2859
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:53,110
All right.

2860
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:53,291
Like,

2861
01:14:53,291 --> 01:14:54,124
whoa.

2862
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,120
Just real like it was well done,

2863
01:14:57,610 --> 01:14:58,930
but it was real like,

2864
01:14:59,470 --> 01:15:01,480
like going through it and
then about to go on stage.

2865
01:15:01,481 --> 01:15:01,931
And I was like,

2866
01:15:01,931 --> 01:15:02,950
are you fucking kidding me?

2867
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:04,131
None of that.

2868
01:15:04,131 --> 01:15:04,541
It's funny.

2869
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:07,120
And Barry Katz is the whole
time as arguing behind me going,

2870
01:15:07,121 --> 01:15:08,680
he wants a law of Mike.

2871
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:10,000
He wants a lav mic.

2872
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:10,301
I go,

2873
01:15:10,301 --> 01:15:10,421
no,

2874
01:15:10,421 --> 01:15:10,690
I don't.

2875
01:15:10,690 --> 01:15:12,070
I want to fuck a microphone in my hand.

2876
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:13,840
He wants a fogging law of mine.

2877
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:15,260
Get a Mike.

2878
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,031
I think a bear.

2879
01:15:16,031 --> 01:15:17,490
I don't want a lot of
Mike Bell Bell anymore.

2880
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:18,400
I'll lob mine.

2881
01:15:18,401 --> 01:15:19,234
And he kept

2882
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:21,160
telling me,

2883
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:22,420
I got very cats.

2884
01:15:22,430 --> 01:15:25,270
Your manager I want to hit
at the time he was fired.

2885
01:15:25,271 --> 01:15:25,620
Him Too.

2886
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:26,453
That's weird.

2887
01:15:27,050 --> 01:15:28,810
I fired him in an Alabama
and you guys are fired.

2888
01:15:28,811 --> 01:15:30,040
Him La Chapelle.

2889
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:30,610
Yeah.

2890
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:31,210
Did He,

2891
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:32,500
was he your a manager at one point?

2892
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:35,140
Did he owe you money or something?

2893
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:35,500
Yes.

2894
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:35,750
Yeah,

2895
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:37,030
he owed me from money for a long time.

2896
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:37,871
He was,

2897
01:15:37,871 --> 01:15:38,470
uh,

2898
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:38,981
it was,

2899
01:15:38,981 --> 01:15:39,370
uh,

2900
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:41,560
he owned a company that was called,

2901
01:15:41,561 --> 01:15:42,250
um,

2902
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:45,700
Boston and New York comedy
or comedy in New York.

2903
01:15:45,701 --> 01:15:47,020
Comedy in New York.

2904
01:15:47,021 --> 01:15:47,580
Entertainment.

2905
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:48,190
They,

2906
01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:51,430
they got in a hole and they started
owing people money from a college gigs,

2907
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:53,290
but he paid me eventually,

2908
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:55,080
but it took a while.

2909
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:55,810
I'm not a bad guy.

2910
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:56,411
He's a,

2911
01:15:56,411 --> 01:15:57,244
he's,

2912
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:58,300
I don't know if I would say that.

2913
01:15:59,170 --> 01:15:59,770
I'll say it.

2914
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:00,520
I'll say it.

2915
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:01,340
He's not a bad guy.

2916
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:04,480
I definitely am not going
to be my manager right now,

2917
01:16:04,481 --> 01:16:06,790
but everybody's fired him.

2918
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:08,051
Who else?

2919
01:16:08,051 --> 01:16:08,651
Who else fired?

2920
01:16:08,651 --> 01:16:10,270
I'm thinking about the Anthony Clarke,

2921
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:15,520
his list of being firing to
Paulo fucking Dave Chappelle.

2922
01:16:15,940 --> 01:16:16,840
Jay still has him.

2923
01:16:16,841 --> 01:16:17,530
Right.

2924
01:16:17,530 --> 01:16:18,320
Amazing.

2925
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:19,130
Um,

2926
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:20,290
does Dane still have him?

2927
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:21,190
Nope.

2928
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:22,330
No Dane fired him.

2929
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:23,283
Whoa,

2930
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:23,981
dude.

2931
01:16:23,981 --> 01:16:26,140
I tried Dane Cook fired yet.

2932
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:26,870
Barry Katz.

2933
01:16:26,870 --> 01:16:27,051
Yeah.

2934
01:16:27,051 --> 01:16:27,370
Yeah,

2935
01:16:27,370 --> 01:16:28,150
we talked about it.

2936
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:28,361
Joe,

2937
01:16:28,361 --> 01:16:32,420
we talked about and on a podcast ice
house when Dan came in to talk about,

2938
01:16:32,430 --> 01:16:33,760
was thinking about myself

2939
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:37,333
at all.

2940
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:41,200
I tend to blank out too.

2941
01:16:41,201 --> 01:16:42,640
When you start talking about Barry Katz,

2942
01:16:42,641 --> 01:16:43,474
I just go,

2943
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:44,320
you know,

2944
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:44,681
the,

2945
01:16:44,681 --> 01:16:45,514
uh,

2946
01:16:45,550 --> 01:16:46,370
the,

2947
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:47,290
what were we talking about?

2948
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:47,681
Oh yeah.

2949
01:16:47,681 --> 01:16:49,800
So that was how I did my company's
infrastructure with Barry going,

2950
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:51,130
he wants somewhere Olam.

2951
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:52,263
Why is he,

2952
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:53,170
why is he doing that?

2953
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:54,251
I have no idea.

2954
01:16:54,251 --> 01:16:54,521
I go,

2955
01:16:54,521 --> 01:16:55,660
I get to the fucking,

2956
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:57,130
I tell him a hundred times,

2957
01:16:57,150 --> 01:16:59,140
just decides that you'd be
better off with a lot of light.

2958
01:16:59,170 --> 01:17:01,030
Looks better than a lot of
you should've worn a suit.

2959
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:02,320
I love your impersonation.

2960
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:03,791
I actually do.

2961
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:05,200
I actually do a better impression.

2962
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,060
I do it a really great,

2963
01:17:07,061 --> 01:17:07,990
very impression.

2964
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:09,303
Uh,

2965
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:09,860
if,

2966
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:10,940
if you know Barry,

2967
01:17:10,970 --> 01:17:11,870
I do a great one,

2968
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:14,910
like if you've worked with
Barry because like Brian,

2969
01:17:14,911 --> 01:17:15,980
so you be me.

2970
01:17:15,981 --> 01:17:16,450
Okay.

2971
01:17:16,450 --> 01:17:17,070
All right.

2972
01:17:17,070 --> 01:17:17,903
Okay.

2973
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:20,240
Fuck off.

2974
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:20,740
So wait,

2975
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:22,550
this is exactly how real Barry works.

2976
01:17:22,551 --> 01:17:23,290
Okay.

2977
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:24,080
So Brian,

2978
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,400
tell me about your podcast.

2979
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:29,570
Okay.

2980
01:17:29,570 --> 01:17:30,403
No.

2981
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:32,130
What'd you do on Brian?

2982
01:17:32,170 --> 01:17:33,190
That's crazy.

2983
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:33,691
No,

2984
01:17:33,691 --> 01:17:33,831
no,

2985
01:17:33,831 --> 01:17:33,961
no,

2986
01:17:33,961 --> 01:17:34,081
no,

2987
01:17:34,081 --> 01:17:34,500
no.

2988
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:35,470
The point is he,

2989
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,500
he listens and he never speaks.

2990
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:40,860
So you end up telling him more than
you'd ever want to tell anybody.

2991
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:41,940
So he go,

2992
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:43,020
he just nods like,

2993
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:43,893
okay,

2994
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:44,491
well you know,

2995
01:17:44,491 --> 01:17:46,020
you need to turn that shit back on him.

2996
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:47,330
I never,

2997
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:48,600
I was a child.

2998
01:17:48,601 --> 01:17:49,660
I was fucking fill,

2999
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:51,140
fill the air form.

3000
01:17:51,470 --> 01:17:52,231
Just stare at them.

3001
01:17:52,231 --> 01:17:54,570
You didn't give me the best
of the best fucking advice.

3002
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,430
He's given me the best,

3003
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:57,270
uh,

3004
01:17:57,270 --> 01:18:00,750
pump up speeches and the best advices
in my life that I'd never took off with

3005
01:18:00,751 --> 01:18:02,340
that being the best advice he ever gave.

3006
01:18:02,341 --> 01:18:05,970
The first development deal I got was I
was doing comedy six months and he was

3007
01:18:05,971 --> 01:18:06,061
like,

3008
01:18:06,061 --> 01:18:07,650
can I give you some advice Paul?

3009
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:08,311
And I was like,

3010
01:18:08,311 --> 01:18:08,490
yeah.

3011
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:08,821
He goes,

3012
01:18:08,821 --> 01:18:09,990
hold on for a second.

3013
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:10,801
And then he just goes,

3014
01:18:10,801 --> 01:18:11,611
disappears in his office.

3015
01:18:11,611 --> 01:18:12,540
It comes back and he's like,

3016
01:18:12,930 --> 01:18:14,760
give him get information.

3017
01:18:14,761 --> 01:18:15,600
Don't give it.

3018
01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:16,321
I'm gonna go,

3019
01:18:16,321 --> 01:18:17,154
what's that mean?

3020
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:17,641
He goes,

3021
01:18:17,641 --> 01:18:19,350
exactly and hangs up.

3022
01:18:19,890 --> 01:18:20,191
I'm like,

3023
01:18:20,191 --> 01:18:21,024
what the fuck?

3024
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:24,660
And basically saying the managers
and handle things mysterious.

3025
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:26,490
I'm direct.

3026
01:18:26,490 --> 01:18:27,600
And that he basically was saying,

3027
01:18:27,630 --> 01:18:30,390
do not tell anyone you've
got a development deal.

3028
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:30,841
It's just,

3029
01:18:30,841 --> 01:18:31,674
listen,

3030
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:32,641
you don't wish I did that.

3031
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:36,570
I wish I'd done that because I made a
bunch of enemies like starting in comedy

3032
01:18:36,571 --> 01:18:37,250
because I was like,

3033
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:39,060
I was trying to fix to six
periods of underwhelm a deal.

3034
01:18:39,061 --> 01:18:39,840
And everyone's like,

3035
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:40,471
but you work the door.

3036
01:18:40,471 --> 01:18:40,801
And I was like,

3037
01:18:40,801 --> 01:18:42,690
I know where that crazy
and no one was like,

3038
01:18:42,691 --> 01:18:43,590
congratulations.

3039
01:18:43,591 --> 01:18:44,220
Everyone's like,

3040
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:45,180
fuck this guy.

3041
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:46,860
So I wish I'd listened to him,

3042
01:18:46,861 --> 01:18:47,730
but I didn't,

3043
01:18:48,930 --> 01:18:50,490
I'm not a given get information,

3044
01:18:50,491 --> 01:18:52,320
give gum would give
information kind of guy.

3045
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:53,153
You know what I mean?

3046
01:18:53,710 --> 01:18:54,440
I'm pretty,

3047
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:55,120
I jumped to fight.

3048
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:56,370
Why did you fire him?

3049
01:18:56,970 --> 01:18:57,421
Because,

3050
01:18:57,421 --> 01:18:58,080
um,

3051
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:58,711
he didn't get me,

3052
01:18:58,711 --> 01:18:59,790
he didn't get my sense of humor.

3053
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:00,650
Yeah.

3054
01:19:00,650 --> 01:19:01,240
Like I gave up,

3055
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:02,100
I did a prank call.

3056
01:19:02,101 --> 01:19:04,050
He got purchased by
new wave entertainment.

3057
01:19:04,350 --> 01:19:08,730
I did a prank called a new wave one time
when I just called in and it was there

3058
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:12,090
like voicemail for the
entire 500 people person,

3059
01:19:12,091 --> 01:19:12,720
company.

3060
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:13,110
Right.

3061
01:19:13,110 --> 01:19:14,790
And I went and I was like,

3062
01:19:14,930 --> 01:19:15,301
and it was like,

3063
01:19:15,301 --> 01:19:15,381
well,

3064
01:19:15,381 --> 01:19:19,070
if you leave a message in the general
mailbox and I hit that and then I go,

3065
01:19:19,090 --> 01:19:19,351
barrier,

3066
01:19:19,351 --> 01:19:19,951
it's bird.

3067
01:19:19,951 --> 01:19:20,641
I'm fucked up.

3068
01:19:20,641 --> 01:19:21,930
Pick me up there.

3069
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,700
I know you're listening
to this pig of the phone.

3070
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:24,960
Very forgot the fucking phone.

3071
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:25,981
Barry.

3072
01:19:25,981 --> 01:19:26,371
Brian,

3073
01:19:26,371 --> 01:19:27,220
I know you're there in your underwear.

3074
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:27,720
Grab it.

3075
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:28,950
Brian Volk wastes Brian,

3076
01:19:28,951 --> 01:19:29,431
grab it,

3077
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:30,264
grab it.

3078
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:31,890
And then Barry got really upset.

3079
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:32,281
He was like,

3080
01:19:32,281 --> 01:19:32,491
dude,

3081
01:19:32,491 --> 01:19:32,730
you,

3082
01:19:32,730 --> 01:19:33,960
you can't do that Papa.

3083
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:36,450
I mean there are fucking
adults don't work here.

3084
01:19:36,530 --> 01:19:37,320
And I was like,

3085
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:37,540
wow.

3086
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:38,600
I goes to joke Barry,

3087
01:19:38,610 --> 01:19:39,780
I'm a fucking comic.

3088
01:19:39,781 --> 01:19:40,830
You've got to get that.

3089
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:41,580
And he was like,

3090
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:42,241
if not a joke,

3091
01:19:42,241 --> 01:19:43,051
you were hammered.

3092
01:19:43,051 --> 01:19:43,501
And I was like,

3093
01:19:43,501 --> 01:19:44,100
no.

3094
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:45,360
It was a fucking joke.

3095
01:19:45,361 --> 01:19:46,320
Like I do.

3096
01:19:46,321 --> 01:19:47,520
I really think you're sitting by a voice,

3097
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:49,800
like a real answering machine at new wave.

3098
01:19:49,801 --> 01:19:52,260
Like I got so upset as
he and a guy at all.

3099
01:19:52,450 --> 01:19:52,770
Uh,

3100
01:19:52,770 --> 01:19:53,011
no,

3101
01:19:53,011 --> 01:19:53,850
but he has no,

3102
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:54,330
no,

3103
01:19:54,330 --> 01:19:54,720
no.

3104
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:55,381
I don't think he is.

3105
01:19:55,381 --> 01:19:56,220
I don't think he drinks.

3106
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:56,980
He tell you.

3107
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:59,610
I know he against drinking
cause he liked the Tempe Improv.

3108
01:19:59,730 --> 01:20:00,520
He is not,

3109
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:01,353
he's not going to work.

3110
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,070
I would definitely say
he's not for drinking.

3111
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:04,140
Was never for my drinking.

3112
01:20:04,650 --> 01:20:05,720
He was like mad.

3113
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:06,271
His wedding.

3114
01:20:06,271 --> 01:20:08,490
I was hammered and shirtless.

3115
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,170
I was sitting with Bobcat,

3116
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:12,150
with a bobcat.

3117
01:20:12,151 --> 01:20:13,800
Jeff Ross,

3118
01:20:13,890 --> 01:20:14,723
um,

3119
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:15,780
John Dimaggio.

3120
01:20:15,781 --> 01:20:16,614
You remember him?

3121
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:21,120
John Measure Red Italian around guy and
like and like and like that table that,

3122
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:22,920
where the fuck is that guy dude,

3123
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,170
he's still around these fucking oh,

3124
01:20:25,171 --> 01:20:26,610
he's fucking awesome.

3125
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:26,790
Yeah,

3126
01:20:26,790 --> 01:20:28,110
I run into him so much.

3127
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:28,941
So John,

3128
01:20:28,941 --> 01:20:29,774
imagine you and I.

3129
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:30,840
Oh man.

3130
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:34,860
Buries wedding was the best
because everyone was fucked
up except for Barry and

3131
01:20:34,861 --> 01:20:36,180
Barry was trying to
micromanage everything.

3132
01:20:36,690 --> 01:20:39,750
So like he and he had all he had was
just a bunch of fucking stone talent.

3133
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:40,710
So me,

3134
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:44,550
Jeff Ross and John Dimaggio go
behind the stage to smoke a joint.

3135
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:48,150
We all get spoken joint and
then John Dimaggio goes,

3136
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:49,201
don't worry,

3137
01:20:49,201 --> 01:20:50,430
I know how to get in here.

3138
01:20:50,490 --> 01:20:55,140
And he just opens a curtain to get us

3139
01:20:55,141 --> 01:20:55,974
the ceremony.

3140
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:56,931
Opens a curtain.

3141
01:20:56,931 --> 01:20:57,071
Me,

3142
01:20:57,071 --> 01:20:57,261

3143

Ross and him walk out and we're on stage
with his with like Barry's grandmother

3144
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:03,750

3145
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:04,440

3147
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:11,870
So then we all go sit down and fucking
and fucking bugging everyone starts.

3148
01:21:12,661 --> 01:21:14,820
Everyone starts like
giving like personal notes.

3149
01:21:14,821 --> 01:21:15,510
Right.

3150
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:16,200
I'm sitting next to,

3151
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:17,100
I want to say,

3152
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:19,320
I want to say it's either Bob Katter,

3153
01:21:19,321 --> 01:21:20,370
Jeff Ross,

3154
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,500
and so I'm fucking hammered.

3155
01:21:22,630 --> 01:21:22,921
I'm like,

3156
01:21:22,921 --> 01:21:23,161

3157
01:21:23,161 --> 01:21:26,730
I'm hammered and everyone's going
up and saying special words.

3158
01:21:26,731 --> 01:21:28,410
Frank Caliendo came up and did like,

3159
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:32,880
like six impressions in three minutes
and like why I dunno is three minutes of

3160
01:21:32,881 --> 01:21:33,211
thunder.

3161
01:21:33,211 --> 01:21:37,920
He went and did it and like every
comics coming up know it's fucking,

3162
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:40,250
but it was actually to be
some time at cal ended.

3163
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:41,093
Very talented.

3164
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:42,180
So people are going up,

3165
01:21:42,181 --> 01:21:44,940
people are going up and really did.

3166
01:21:44,941 --> 01:21:46,770
I would have loved to done
five minutes at your wedding.

3167
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:47,550
It was a fun,

3168
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:48,180
it was a fun,

3169
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:48,991
it was a fun wedding.

3170
01:21:48,991 --> 01:21:51,270
If you were not buried
Buddy Hackett's there.

3171
01:21:51,271 --> 01:21:51,571
Right?

3172
01:21:51,571 --> 01:21:52,080
This is gift.

3173
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:52,680
Even better.

3174
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:54,090
This gets even fucking better.

3175
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:54,690
Okay,

3176
01:21:54,690 --> 01:21:55,830

3177
01:21:55,890 --> 01:21:57,690

3178
01:21:57,691 --> 01:21:58,261

3179
01:21:58,261 --> 01:21:59,910
Dimaggio goes up and says words.

3180
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,410
Jeff Ross goes up and says words.

3181
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:03,060
I think I want to say bobcat did.

3182
01:22:03,061 --> 01:22:03,960
I doubt he did though.

3183
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:04,830
Knowing who he is.

3184
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:09,510
I'm sitting in between him and Bobcat
and Jeff and one of them starts going,

3185
01:22:09,511 --> 01:22:10,350
you should talk.

3186
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:11,161
And I was like,

3187
01:22:11,161 --> 01:22:11,870
what?

3188
01:22:11,870 --> 01:22:14,580
And like get on stage saying
it's like then total dick move,

3189
01:22:14,581 --> 01:22:15,030
right.

3190
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:16,500
I should not be speaking at all.

3191
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:17,070
Right.

3192
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:17,700
Talk,

3193
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:18,451
see something.

3194
01:22:18,451 --> 01:22:19,590
So I get up on stage,

3195
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:20,521
grabbed the Mike,

3196
01:22:20,521 --> 01:22:23,910
Right when they start playing
the voicemails from Australia,

3197
01:22:23,911 --> 01:22:26,160
from his wife's family who can't be there.

3198
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:26,520
Oh.

3199
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:27,760
So I just talk over all,

3200
01:22:28,230 --> 01:22:28,950
oh,

3201
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:30,210
it's really good to be here.

3202
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:30,740
And they're like,

3203
01:22:30,740 --> 01:22:32,190
can may miss your Susana.

3204
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:33,300
It was fucking nightmare.

3205
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:34,140
Right?

3206
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:35,660
And you kept talking because I didn't,

3207
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:36,720
I'm so fucked up.

3208
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:37,411
I couldn't hear a thing.

3209
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:37,651
Right.

3210
01:22:37,651 --> 01:22:39,000
So the fucking,

3211
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:40,210
I get off stage,

3212
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:41,160
I got offstage,

3213
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:42,780
Buddy Hackett gets on right after me.

3214
01:22:42,781 --> 01:22:44,010
They're still playing fucking voicemails,

3215
01:22:44,011 --> 01:22:44,520
right?

3216
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:45,310
Buddy Hackett gets on.

3217
01:22:45,310 --> 01:22:46,560
He's more fucked up than I am.

3218
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,090
And there's a fucking,

3219
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:50,070
there's a piano that's humming going

3220
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:55,410
and Buddy Hackett and typical buddy
Hackett voice goes time to fucking piano

3221
01:22:55,411 --> 01:22:56,130
off.

3222
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:56,880
And they're like,

3223
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:57,960
and everyone laughs and he goes,

3224
01:22:57,961 --> 01:23:00,800
I'm being fucking serious
trying to fucking piano.

3225
01:23:00,890 --> 01:23:01,471
Often though,

3226
01:23:01,471 --> 01:23:02,260
everyone asks him harder.

3227
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:02,820
He goes,

3228
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:05,010
daughter or I'll fix it and
everyone laughed even harder.

3229
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:06,910
He throws his drink on the piano,

3230
01:23:06,911 --> 01:23:07,420
right?

3231
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:08,290
Electric Piano,

3232
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:09,100
it,

3233
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:09,461
it goes.

3234
01:23:09,461 --> 01:23:11,250
This is like,

3235
01:23:11,470 --> 01:23:15,370
we see sparks smoke comes out and the
place falls on the ground laughing,

3236
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:16,360
right?

3237
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:17,021
Buddy had goes.

3238
01:23:17,021 --> 01:23:18,040
That's what I'm talking about.

3239
01:23:18,041 --> 01:23:19,090
Everyone applauds.

3240
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:24,240
It is awesome here through a funny task
rank on an electric piano and Barry had

3241
01:23:24,761 --> 01:23:27,190
to pay like 25 grand
for the fucking piano.

3242
01:23:27,191 --> 01:23:27,911
So at the end of the wedding,

3243
01:23:27,911 --> 01:23:32,911
berries like a fucking worst
cavalcade up to shit on shit on shit.

3244
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:35,800
Who's was a great wedding?

3245
01:23:35,801 --> 01:23:36,250
I would.

3246
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:37,630
How much do you have to pay for the piano?

3247
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:39,101
I don't know.

3248
01:23:39,101 --> 01:23:40,150
I'm finding the way I tell the story.

3249
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:40,781
25 grand,

3250
01:23:40,781 --> 01:23:41,890
but quite five grand.

3251
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:43,223
It was a beetle

3252
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:44,293
romance story,

3253
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:45,261
Buddy Hackett.

3254
01:23:45,261 --> 01:23:45,951
It's a bad ass.

3255
01:23:45,951 --> 01:23:47,060
And you fucked with him Joe.

3256
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:48,073
I didn't

3257
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:50,713
even respond to him.

3258
01:23:50,730 --> 01:23:51,501
He's a gangster.

3259
01:23:51,501 --> 01:23:52,580
I didn't respond to all the time.

3260
01:23:52,581 --> 01:23:53,414
You fucked with the gangs.

3261
01:23:53,450 --> 01:23:54,283
I guess I did.

3262
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:55,551
He's a,

3263
01:23:55,551 --> 01:23:56,930
apparently it was a very angry dude.

3264
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:57,470
Yeah,

3265
01:23:57,470 --> 01:23:57,741
he was.

3266
01:23:57,741 --> 01:23:58,190
He was.

3267
01:23:58,190 --> 01:23:59,930
He was a nice guy other
than met buddy a few times.

3268
01:23:59,931 --> 01:24:00,591
I liked him a lot.

3269
01:24:00,591 --> 01:24:02,790
I was on season of comics.

3270
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:05,150
I watched it on my couch jam.

3271
01:24:05,151 --> 01:24:05,781
Fascinating.

3272
01:24:05,781 --> 01:24:06,710
It was like really?

3273
01:24:07,070 --> 01:24:12,070
This guy was clearly steel in
material calcs was like yelling at me.

3274
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:13,730
You're a fucking asshole.

3275
01:24:13,731 --> 01:24:14,181
When I was like,

3276
01:24:14,181 --> 01:24:14,860
wow,

3277
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:16,160
you handled it like a gentleman.

3278
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,140
He was a guy who stole jokes.

3279
01:24:18,170 --> 01:24:20,960
That's the guy was still jokes for sure.

3280
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:22,730
We got my guy responds like that.

3281
01:24:22,731 --> 01:24:23,181
Exactly.

3282
01:24:23,181 --> 01:24:24,014
That's how they did it.

3283
01:24:24,050 --> 01:24:25,430
But when a guy responds like that,

3284
01:24:25,431 --> 01:24:26,600
there's only one reason,

3285
01:24:26,601 --> 01:24:26,870
man.

3286
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:27,111
I mean,

3287
01:24:27,111 --> 01:24:28,700
psychologically speaking,

3288
01:24:28,701 --> 01:24:33,701
why would you be so adamant about the
idea that you know that this guy wasn't a

3289
01:24:34,131 --> 01:24:35,660
thief and that you know,

3290
01:24:35,870 --> 01:24:37,280
you never heard those jokes for like,

3291
01:24:37,281 --> 01:24:41,120
what are you saying like you and then
the other check that was there was like,

3292
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:42,530
he made him his own.

3293
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,030
He made those jokes his on and I was like,

3294
01:24:44,031 --> 01:24:44,900
wow.

3295
01:24:45,230 --> 01:24:46,063
It was Monique.

3296
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:47,473
She was like me.

3297
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:47,841
Yeah,

3298
01:24:47,841 --> 01:24:49,130
you made those jokes you're on.

3299
01:24:49,131 --> 01:24:49,641
And I was like,

3300
01:24:49,641 --> 01:24:50,474
whoa.

3301
01:24:51,050 --> 01:24:51,441
I was like,

3302
01:24:51,441 --> 01:24:53,810
you made them your own wow.

3303
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:56,300
Areas.

3304
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:58,180
Last comic standing was
not the yardstick for us.

3305
01:24:58,600 --> 01:24:59,391
And by the way,

3306
01:24:59,391 --> 01:24:59,811
by the way,

3307
01:24:59,811 --> 01:25:00,644
the judging,

3308
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:02,300
this was a very cats show too.

3309
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:03,981
And by the way,

3310
01:25:03,981 --> 01:25:05,920
the judging was complete total horse shit.

3311
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:06,711
It didn't matter.

3312
01:25:06,711 --> 01:25:06,891
We,

3313
01:25:06,891 --> 01:25:09,440
there was people that we voted for that
didn't get in and people that we didn't

3314
01:25:09,441 --> 01:25:10,370
go for the God in,

3315
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:11,391
they had decided,

3316
01:25:11,391 --> 01:25:14,330
the producers all got
together and decided how to,

3317
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:15,590
how to put people on.

3318
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:18,470
I remember I did trying to remember,

3319
01:25:18,471 --> 01:25:19,940
I'm drew Carey walked off.

3320
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:21,500
It was a judge and uh,

3321
01:25:21,530 --> 01:25:23,420
who else didn't matter
because of Dan Adelman.

3322
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:26,150
10 elements are very funny
comic and he should've won,

3323
01:25:26,450 --> 01:25:28,100
but he just wasn't castable like,

3324
01:25:28,101 --> 01:25:31,040
it wasn't one of the guys that are
looking for that's so ridiculous.

3325
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,530
Them ideas of who's
castable and who's not.

3326
01:25:33,620 --> 01:25:33,831
You know,

3327
01:25:33,831 --> 01:25:35,660
it's so funny whenever
you get a bunch of people,

3328
01:25:35,661 --> 01:25:39,380
like I'm so used to doing the podcast
where there's no one telling us what to

3329
01:25:39,381 --> 01:25:39,890
do,

3330
01:25:39,890 --> 01:25:43,460
but to watch like Dave Attell doing
showed yesterday and the guy's like,

3331
01:25:43,461 --> 01:25:44,181
can you sit up?

3332
01:25:44,181 --> 01:25:45,014
Can you move this?

3333
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:45,831
The guy asked me,

3334
01:25:45,831 --> 01:25:46,790
actually asked me,

3335
01:25:46,910 --> 01:25:47,600
can you,

3336
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,330
can you push your right
pant leg down a little?

3337
01:25:50,870 --> 01:25:51,470
And I was like,

3338
01:25:51,470 --> 01:25:52,160
why?

3339
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:52,311
Well,

3340
01:25:52,311 --> 01:25:53,840
it's kind of puffy in that one spot.

3341
01:25:54,050 --> 01:25:54,410
I'm like,

3342
01:25:54,410 --> 01:25:56,030
oh my fucking God.

3343
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:56,470
They,

3344
01:25:56,470 --> 01:25:59,720
you go fucking what kind
of Weirdo micro managing.

3345
01:25:59,721 --> 01:26:01,490
You're looking at puffs on pants,

3346
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:02,600
but that's how they do it,

3347
01:26:02,601 --> 01:26:03,080
man.

3348
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:04,370
What you want to show.

3349
01:26:04,371 --> 01:26:04,611
Yeah,

3350
01:26:04,611 --> 01:26:05,001
exactly.

3351
01:26:05,001 --> 01:26:05,630
It is their job.

3352
01:26:05,630 --> 01:26:06,211
When we were in a showing,

3353
01:26:06,211 --> 01:26:07,310
it's like five,

3354
01:26:07,311 --> 01:26:10,640
six different people yelling instructions
and all trying to piece this thing

3355
01:26:10,641 --> 01:26:11,420
together.

3356
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:12,950
It's way less harmonious.

3357
01:26:12,951 --> 01:26:14,780
Then you piecing it together on your own,

3358
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:15,530
you know,

3359
01:26:15,530 --> 01:26:16,490
the less,

3360
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:17,690
less is more,

3361
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:18,480
you know,

3362
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:18,950
like,

3363
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:20,240
do you feel like that with your show?

3364
01:26:20,241 --> 01:26:21,620
Do you ever feel like
with birth to conquer,

3365
01:26:21,621 --> 01:26:21,981
like man,

3366
01:26:21,981 --> 01:26:25,940
I should take the reins on this bitch
and just figured out how to do it myself.

3367
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:26,790
Aye.

3368
01:26:26,790 --> 01:26:27,230
Aye.

3369
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:27,510
Aye.

3370
01:26:27,510 --> 01:26:28,150
Uh,

3371
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:29,200
did he ever feel like that?

3372
01:26:29,201 --> 01:26:29,591
I do.

3373
01:26:29,591 --> 01:26:29,951
I do,

3374
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:31,720
but I feel like I would fuck it up.

3375
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:37,030
And I don't know if I
could say this forever,

3376
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,100
but we'll definitely
do this for right now.

3377
01:26:39,430 --> 01:26:41,410
The people I'm working with right now,

3378
01:26:41,411 --> 01:26:43,440
and I know I'm not talking
to my mall brush company,

3379
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:46,060
just talking about
executive wise executives,

3380
01:26:46,061 --> 01:26:48,400
the ones I'm working with really seem
like they know what they're doing.

3381
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:48,611
Yeah,

3382
01:26:48,611 --> 01:26:49,770
you have a good crew like that.

3383
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:51,640
You actually fucking
really good crew and so,

3384
01:26:51,670 --> 01:26:53,200
so what they're doing now,

3385
01:26:53,410 --> 01:26:53,681
and we're,

3386
01:26:53,681 --> 01:26:55,270
and I'm not doing birth conquer anymore,

3387
01:26:55,271 --> 01:26:56,200
I'm doing a different show.

3388
01:26:56,260 --> 01:26:56,890
What are you doing now?

3389
01:26:56,890 --> 01:26:57,880
It's called trip flip.

3390
01:26:58,030 --> 01:26:58,360
Chip.

3391
01:26:58,360 --> 01:26:58,811
Awesome.

3392
01:26:58,811 --> 01:26:58,991
Yeah,

3393
01:26:58,991 --> 01:26:59,711
that's a good idea.

3394
01:26:59,711 --> 01:27:00,041
Great.

3395
01:27:00,041 --> 01:27:00,701
It's a fucking,

3396
01:27:00,701 --> 01:27:01,150
what is it?

3397
01:27:01,150 --> 01:27:02,050
It's a great show.

3398
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:05,410
We go and we've fucking
take people on vacation,

3399
01:27:05,411 --> 01:27:07,060
like a fucking ridiculous vacation.

3400
01:27:07,090 --> 01:27:08,500
We showed them how to vacation,

3401
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:09,930
like we tell them we don't like,

3402
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:12,130
we go to like the mall of
America or we'll find him there.

3403
01:27:12,131 --> 01:27:13,270
We go to the mall of America and we go,

3404
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:15,610
who wants to go to Mexico?

3405
01:27:15,850 --> 01:27:16,331
And people go,

3406
01:27:16,331 --> 01:27:16,650
I do.

3407
01:27:16,650 --> 01:27:16,901
And to go,

3408
01:27:16,901 --> 01:27:17,200
great.

3409
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:18,220
I'll show you what to do in Mexico.

3410
01:27:18,221 --> 01:27:21,370
I'm taking the Cabo and I'm not going
to make you go stay at the resort.

3411
01:27:21,371 --> 01:27:21,941
I'm going to take you on.

3412
01:27:21,941 --> 01:27:23,980
I'm gonna show you real
cool shit to do in Cabo.

3413
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:25,720
So as a viewer you watch it and you go,

3414
01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:26,411
shut up.

3415
01:27:26,411 --> 01:27:28,600
I can go fucking Baja racing.

3416
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:29,800
Like I can do that for the day.

3417
01:27:29,950 --> 01:27:32,650
I can ride camels on the
beach to a tequila tasting.

3418
01:27:32,890 --> 01:27:35,680
Like there's like we show you the
coolest shit to do in the cities.

3419
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:38,300
Most ideal fucking job ever phone.

3420
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:41,260
You get the best vacations every,

3421
01:27:41,261 --> 01:27:43,360
we weren't going to show we
were in Cancun and drive him,

3422
01:27:43,490 --> 01:27:43,980
uh,

3423
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:44,681
Lamborghini's,

3424
01:27:44,681 --> 01:27:49,681
Ferrari's and Mercedes hundred 40 miles
an hour on open fucking roads because we

3425
01:27:51,011 --> 01:27:51,650
found,

3426
01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:51,900
and,

3427
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:53,470
and you'll find it too when you watch it,

3428
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:57,940
the company that has paid off the federal
Raleigh's to let them fucking drive

3429
01:27:57,941 --> 01:28:00,250
these cars 140 miles on open roads.

3430
01:28:00,430 --> 01:28:00,970
Whoa.

3431
01:28:00,970 --> 01:28:01,480
Yeah,

3432
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:02,120
it's too,

3433
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:02,771
it's Mexico.

3434
01:28:02,771 --> 01:28:04,090
I mean that's the way it works.

3435
01:28:04,180 --> 01:28:04,991
They teach you on the track.

3436
01:28:04,991 --> 01:28:08,160
You got to run a track for the like
half the day and then they take,

3437
01:28:08,170 --> 01:28:08,390
take,

3438
01:28:08,390 --> 01:28:12,310
take you out to tilt in such a loom
and you can just air these bitches out.

3439
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:16,070
Have you seen that video online
or the guy in the Mercedes or a a

3440
01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:17,450
neighbor?

3441
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:18,950
He goes sideways around a corner.

3442
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:21,740
Do you think that's a,

3443
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:23,510
do you think that's a fake video?

3444
01:28:23,570 --> 01:28:23,930
Like A,

3445
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:25,400
and I think it's a fake video.

3446
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:26,453
I can't be really,

3447
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:27,920
well I think it's very,

3448
01:28:27,970 --> 01:28:29,120
because it's one of those videos.

3449
01:28:29,121 --> 01:28:30,080
It's like one,

3450
01:28:30,081 --> 01:28:31,230
why is it guy just,

3451
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:31,911
I don't know.

3452
01:28:31,911 --> 01:28:33,890
Recording people do that.

3453
01:28:34,190 --> 01:28:35,023
I know.

3454
01:28:35,330 --> 01:28:39,980
And then it's just like how shit and
he was barely going fast and he loses

3455
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:40,730
control.

3456
01:28:40,730 --> 01:28:41,451
Did you notice that?

3457
01:28:41,451 --> 01:28:42,080
Like he just,

3458
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:43,610
he wasn't going like super fast.

3459
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:45,380
He just like kind of
sped up and I was like,

3460
01:28:45,381 --> 01:28:48,350
how did he lose control of
his Lamborghini that bad?

3461
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:48,981
And then when,

3462
01:28:48,981 --> 01:28:50,990
how it was placed in
between the two cards,

3463
01:28:50,991 --> 01:28:51,530
it's like,

3464
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:51,741
all right,

3465
01:28:51,741 --> 01:28:54,380
this is some kind of weird fake video.

3466
01:28:54,410 --> 01:28:56,120
Like who's behind it though?

3467
01:28:56,121 --> 01:28:56,661
Who knows?

3468
01:28:56,661 --> 01:29:00,830
Like Lamborghini maybe would say
you probably got a good point,

3469
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:02,100
but Lamborghinis

3470
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:05,970
are notoriously hard to control and
that's a four wheel drive car too.

3471
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:07,340
That's a funky car.

3472
01:29:07,410 --> 01:29:08,710
Really hard to control that.

3473
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:11,380
Especially because it's all
like Salish paddle battle.

3474
01:29:11,420 --> 01:29:12,450
I might not be,

3475
01:29:12,451 --> 01:29:13,320
see that's,

3476
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:14,183
that's the,

3477
01:29:14,230 --> 01:29:16,560
that's the Guyardo the one that crashed.

3478
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:16,820
Right,

3479
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:17,760
and the Guy Auto Yuki,

3480
01:29:17,770 --> 01:29:19,980
you can still get them with the manual.

3481
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:20,941
The Guy,

3482
01:29:20,941 --> 01:29:21,331
you know,

3483
01:29:21,331 --> 01:29:26,331
he might've like over hit the gas on a
shift or he might've went sideways and

3484
01:29:26,470 --> 01:29:28,110
not sure.

3485
01:29:28,111 --> 01:29:31,170
I'll have some and he might've
had to rig it might be real,

3486
01:29:31,230 --> 01:29:32,220
but I agree with you.

3487
01:29:32,221 --> 01:29:32,960
It doesn't look weird.

3488
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:33,180
It's,

3489
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:34,470
it's a suspicious physics.

3490
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:34,900
Right.

3491
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:38,640
It's weird because I saw it last night
for my first time and immediately I

3492
01:29:38,641 --> 01:29:39,540
looked at it going,

3493
01:29:39,990 --> 01:29:42,430
how did he just lose
control that fastest that I,

3494
01:29:42,630 --> 01:29:43,680
it wasn't that fast.

3495
01:29:43,681 --> 01:29:44,820
He wasn't going that fast.

3496
01:29:44,850 --> 01:29:45,061
Well,

3497
01:29:45,061 --> 01:29:46,030
it doesn't matter anyway,

3498
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:47,250
when you're going around a corner,

3499
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:48,753
especially

3500
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:51,720
using street tires,

3501
01:29:52,190 --> 01:29:53,310
but the car gets out of control.

3502
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:54,550
There's no fucking bring it a pack.

3503
01:29:54,630 --> 01:29:55,463
It's hard.

3504
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:56,270
It's hard.

3505
01:29:56,270 --> 01:29:56,760
You just,

3506
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:57,900
you have to know how to drive.

3507
01:29:58,110 --> 01:30:01,450
There's a great video of two guys in
Corvettes and there's a guy behind him and

3508
01:30:01,451 --> 01:30:03,180
films it and they're in sugar land,

3509
01:30:03,410 --> 01:30:04,220
not in sugar land.

3510
01:30:04,220 --> 01:30:05,070
The woodlands,

3511
01:30:05,071 --> 01:30:06,120
I think in Texas,

3512
01:30:06,121 --> 01:30:06,780
one of those.

3513
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:08,550
And they take off at the light.

3514
01:30:08,551 --> 01:30:11,210
One Guy fucking completely
loses control t bones,

3515
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:11,490
you know,

3516
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:13,330
car like the fun of it.

3517
01:30:13,510 --> 01:30:14,240
And it's,

3518
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:17,610
it's a real video that's super real
because the guy and the guy and they've

3519
01:30:17,611 --> 01:30:18,151
watched the video.

3520
01:30:18,151 --> 01:30:18,451
All right,

3521
01:30:18,451 --> 01:30:20,010
let's see what these assholes do.

3522
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:21,600
You know they're going to race.

3523
01:30:21,970 --> 01:30:22,620
Yeah.

3524
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:23,453
And he got it.

3525
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:24,293
He,

3526
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:26,610
that guy is going to be
filming everything from now on.

3527
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:28,260
What a great to catch on film.

3528
01:30:28,290 --> 01:30:31,020
And here's another thing to always think
about when you look at these videos,

3529
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:33,330
it's like you didn't know
that majority of people,

3530
01:30:33,331 --> 01:30:33,790
you know,

3531
01:30:33,790 --> 01:30:34,860
like I'm a little different.

3532
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:36,340
If I were to have filmed it,

3533
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:37,710
it would be looked different.

3534
01:30:37,890 --> 01:30:38,730
But the majority of people,

3535
01:30:38,731 --> 01:30:39,391
you know when you're,

3536
01:30:39,391 --> 01:30:40,440
you're in a car,

3537
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:41,180
you're filming,

3538
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:41,941
use your iPhone,

3539
01:30:41,941 --> 01:30:42,751
your steering,

3540
01:30:42,751 --> 01:30:44,970
you're doing all this shit when
you're going around a corner.

3541
01:30:45,090 --> 01:30:49,290
He was really good with making sure he
caught every single thing that happened

3542
01:30:49,291 --> 01:30:51,480
while he's driving and filming.

3543
01:30:51,481 --> 01:30:53,700
And it was just too good of like,

3544
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:54,451
okay,

3545
01:30:54,451 --> 01:30:54,781
yeah,

3546
01:30:54,781 --> 01:30:55,890
you got the money shot,

3547
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:59,010
where in reality it was probably like
this phone would be flopping around

3548
01:30:59,011 --> 01:31:01,040
looking at fucking ceilings and shit.

3549
01:31:01,041 --> 01:31:01,351
You know,

3550
01:31:01,351 --> 01:31:02,240
a very good point.

3551
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:03,990
It's like you kind of forget that.

3552
01:31:03,991 --> 01:31:04,321
Yes,

3553
01:31:04,321 --> 01:31:05,960
it's filmed on a shitty camera.

3554
01:31:05,961 --> 01:31:06,120
I,

3555
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:07,440
it looks realistic,

3556
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:10,350
but the money shot was recorded perfectly.

3557
01:31:10,351 --> 01:31:12,630
Everything was recorded a
little bit too perfectly.

3558
01:31:12,870 --> 01:31:14,850
And as somebody that
does that kind of shit,

3559
01:31:14,851 --> 01:31:15,470
it's,

3560
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:16,303
it's kind of like a,

3561
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:19,950
I know what the reality is that
this is just some guy filming it.

3562
01:31:19,950 --> 01:31:21,900
He would have been filming
his girlfriend's Crotch,

3563
01:31:22,110 --> 01:31:22,441
you know,

3564
01:31:22,441 --> 01:31:22,651
like,

3565
01:31:22,651 --> 01:31:23,490
it would've been just like,

3566
01:31:23,730 --> 01:31:24,563
yeah,

3567
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:26,360
maybe if that had been you,

3568
01:31:26,361 --> 01:31:27,870
you have gotten the shot perfectly.

3569
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:28,510
Absolutely.

3570
01:31:28,510 --> 01:31:28,771
Yeah.

3571
01:31:28,771 --> 01:31:29,050
The month.

3572
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:30,360
There's a lot of use out there.

3573
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:30,631
Yeah.

3574
01:31:30,631 --> 01:31:33,300
You got to realize this guy
is a guy who's filming things,

3575
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:34,313
you know,

3576
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:36,900
but by just by having a guy who's like,

3577
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:37,863
you know,

3578
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:38,641
who knows,

3579
01:31:38,641 --> 01:31:39,270
who knows though,

3580
01:31:39,270 --> 01:31:41,640
but like it wasn't supposed to be
the guy driving there was filming.

3581
01:31:41,650 --> 01:31:42,451
I think it was,

3582
01:31:42,451 --> 01:31:42,811
I don't know.

3583
01:31:42,811 --> 01:31:43,561
I saw it last night.

3584
01:31:43,561 --> 01:31:43,651
So,

3585
01:31:43,651 --> 01:31:44,281
I don't even remember,

3586
01:31:44,281 --> 01:31:46,710
but some guy showed it to
me at the show last night.

3587
01:31:48,350 --> 01:31:48,550
Yeah.

3588
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:50,460
There's a lot of Douche bags
out there driving like that.

3589
01:31:50,810 --> 01:31:51,210
Yeah.

3590
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:54,030
There's a lot of cars out there that are
super powerful and they're getting more

3591
01:31:54,031 --> 01:31:54,960
powerful every year.

3592
01:31:54,990 --> 01:31:55,860
That's what's really nuts.

3593
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:57,870
Every time like Lamborghini
has to put in new car out,

3594
01:31:57,871 --> 01:31:59,010
they're going to make it more powerful.

3595
01:31:59,050 --> 01:31:59,321
You know,

3596
01:31:59,321 --> 01:32:00,430
last year it was 500

3597
01:32:00,430 --> 01:32:00,970
horsepower,

3598
01:32:00,970 --> 01:32:03,220
$200,000 was the car I was driving cheese.

3599
01:32:03,230 --> 01:32:04,240
I mean you can,

3600
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:04,740
like I,

3601
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:06,400
I try to explain to the people
who were driving it with,

3602
01:32:06,401 --> 01:32:06,971
they were younger.

3603
01:32:06,971 --> 01:32:07,660
I was like,

3604
01:32:07,660 --> 01:32:07,901
I was like,

3605
01:32:07,901 --> 01:32:10,690
this is a once in a lifetime experience
that this will never happen again.

3606
01:32:10,970 --> 01:32:14,920
And they at that age become a super
baller and start buying up them bitches.

3607
01:32:14,950 --> 01:32:16,210
What kind of car was it
that you were driving?

3608
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:16,540
Uh,

3609
01:32:16,540 --> 01:32:18,180
the fucking $600,000 one.

3610
01:32:18,220 --> 01:32:19,990
It's a Lamborghini Mercia Lago or,

3611
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:23,950
and then tour Aventador
we did vintage doors.

3612
01:32:23,951 --> 01:32:25,360
The new one had the pedal,

3613
01:32:25,930 --> 01:32:27,220
the pedal shifters sound.

3614
01:32:27,221 --> 01:32:30,070
Those things make her demons.

3615
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:31,271
I heard you.

3616
01:32:31,271 --> 01:32:35,080
And I want to say that by Osmosis.

3617
01:32:35,170 --> 01:32:35,581
You know,

3618
01:32:35,581 --> 01:32:37,000
like by listening to you enough.

3619
01:32:37,270 --> 01:32:39,280
I don't know if you've
said this about cars,

3620
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:42,250
but I did say this on TV and I definitely,

3621
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,590
I could hear you in my head saying it.

3622
01:32:44,650 --> 01:32:45,910
The car barked at you.

3623
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:46,751
Yeah.

3624
01:32:46,751 --> 01:32:50,280
A lot of people say that just
like they would fucking like,

3625
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:53,530
and I could hear it barking
at me and I fucking loved it.

3626
01:32:53,890 --> 01:32:54,760
I love to hear it.

3627
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:56,470
Here's a manly sounding cars.

3628
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:57,280
Ah,

3629
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:00,790
Lamborghinis and Ferraris and some of the
sweetest tones like the exhaust tones.

3630
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:02,670
God Man.

3631
01:33:02,670 --> 01:33:02,890
Yeah.

3632
01:33:02,890 --> 01:33:03,160
People,

3633
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:08,140
there's like videos on
youtube where people just have
Lamborghini exhaust notes.

3634
01:33:11,410 --> 01:33:12,520
It's got that crazy,

3635
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:14,410
I think they have like some
of them are [inaudible],

3636
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:14,680
right.

3637
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:17,820
This is the mercy of [inaudible] 12
I'm a horrible host cause I don't,

3638
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:21,940
all I know is that it barked
at me fucking Beasley cars,

3639
01:33:21,970 --> 01:33:24,250
but there's some Michael
Vick dog in between my legs.

3640
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:24,521
It's like,

3641
01:33:24,521 --> 01:33:24,911
why would you,

3642
01:33:24,911 --> 01:33:27,580
what are you doing with that
crazy thing really in the states,

3643
01:33:27,581 --> 01:33:28,031
in the states,

3644
01:33:28,031 --> 01:33:28,541
what are you doing?

3645
01:33:28,541 --> 01:33:29,830
Because you can't drive it
over a hundred thousand,

3646
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:30,703
a hundred miles,

3647
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:31,750
a hundred miles per hour.

3648
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:34,980
Like he'll go to jail over a hundred
miles an hour when you really Yo.

3649
01:33:34,981 --> 01:33:35,321
And yeah,

3650
01:33:35,321 --> 01:33:36,220
that's what they were saying.

3651
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:38,380
The guy that started the company and uh,

3652
01:33:38,770 --> 01:33:39,340
and,

3653
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:40,540
and catechumens saying,

3654
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:41,590
I had all these cars,

3655
01:33:41,591 --> 01:33:43,030
but I was in the states
and I couldn't use them.

3656
01:33:43,330 --> 01:33:45,280
And I came down to Mexico
once and some guy said,

3657
01:33:45,281 --> 01:33:45,491
you know,

3658
01:33:45,491 --> 01:33:46,690
you have a pair of for federal alleys,

3659
01:33:46,930 --> 01:33:47,920
you can drive whatever you want.

3660
01:33:48,070 --> 01:33:49,390
Why did he have all of these cars?

3661
01:33:49,391 --> 01:33:50,230
Because he was rich.

3662
01:33:50,370 --> 01:33:50,800
Wow.

3663
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:51,310
And so he,

3664
01:33:51,310 --> 01:33:54,790
now he has a business as a business.

3665
01:33:54,791 --> 01:33:58,990
He decided to take all his cars
that he wasn't into or not driving,

3666
01:33:59,290 --> 01:34:00,240
sending to Cancun,

3667
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:02,950
pay a federal Raleigh's and you
can just take them out for the day.

3668
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:03,131
I mean,

3669
01:34:03,131 --> 01:34:04,270
you got to go with like,

3670
01:34:04,590 --> 01:34:05,950
you've got to go in a group.

3671
01:34:05,951 --> 01:34:06,580
You can't just,

3672
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:08,370
it's not like you just
get a Lamborghini to air,

3673
01:34:09,070 --> 01:34:10,630
but it's fucking fun.

3674
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:13,810
I've never driven anything
140 miles an hour race.

3675
01:34:13,870 --> 01:34:15,040
Racing cars is fun.

3676
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:16,660
It's gotta be very addictive.

3677
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:18,700
Fucking dude.

3678
01:34:18,970 --> 01:34:23,470
All the shit get your body to go fast and
it's supposed to because you feel that

3679
01:34:23,471 --> 01:34:25,710
g forces when you're going
around corners and you make up,

3680
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:27,640
we were going around
corners at 70 miles an hour.

3681
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,420
That's fucking seven like
put that in perspective.

3682
01:34:31,421 --> 01:34:32,740
What you do want to interstate.

3683
01:34:33,010 --> 01:34:36,850
I was taking corners at that Shit
and you make your real face like you,

3684
01:34:36,851 --> 01:34:39,250
there's no cool face when
you drive a car that fast.

3685
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,750
Do you make your real face like that?

3686
01:34:40,930 --> 01:34:45,640
That like I did this like eh cause
that's what I do when I do that speed.

3687
01:34:45,970 --> 01:34:48,550
Did you feel the rear end
sliding on you at all?

3688
01:34:48,570 --> 01:34:48,780
Yeah,

3689
01:34:48,780 --> 01:34:49,613
because it was raining.

3690
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:51,213
Oh

3691
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:53,440
it was raining.

3692
01:34:53,470 --> 01:34:54,850
You have to be careful of a,

3693
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:58,100
with a car that's got that much
power to when you on the gas,

3694
01:34:58,400 --> 01:34:59,090
you know like,

3695
01:34:59,090 --> 01:34:59,570
like,

3696
01:34:59,570 --> 01:35:01,610
like that stupid car
that I have that Shelby,

3697
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:02,810
the Mustang I,

3698
01:35:02,811 --> 01:35:04,820
every time I hit second gear I can't,

3699
01:35:04,910 --> 01:35:07,660
you got to make sure you don't stomp
on the gas too much because it will get

3700
01:35:07,661 --> 01:35:09,620
sideways on you in second gear.

3701
01:35:09,650 --> 01:35:10,483
Give you a little more.

3702
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:11,650
Yeah,

3703
01:35:11,650 --> 01:35:13,160
for Christ you can drive this car.

3704
01:35:13,161 --> 01:35:13,620
I doubt that.

3705
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:16,280
You know that the odds that
that guy in that video,

3706
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:17,840
you know if I can drag that.

3707
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:21,050
Oh you say that though.

3708
01:35:21,051 --> 01:35:22,010
But some,

3709
01:35:22,011 --> 01:35:26,630
a lot of people buy cars and they don't
necessarily know how to handle them when

3710
01:35:26,631 --> 01:35:28,490
though the asset and goes out on them.

3711
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:31,190
I would not be able to recover that car.

3712
01:35:31,220 --> 01:35:32,053
It's hard man.

3713
01:35:32,090 --> 01:35:36,080
It's hard and sometimes you don't want
to let go of the steering or you don't

3714
01:35:36,081 --> 01:35:37,520
want to let go of the gas either.

3715
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:38,720
Sometimes you have to,

3716
01:35:38,721 --> 01:35:40,550
you have to power oversteer you have to,

3717
01:35:40,551 --> 01:35:42,620
you have to fight it with the throttle.

3718
01:35:42,890 --> 01:35:44,660
You know you have to keep
your foot on the gas.

3719
01:35:44,661 --> 01:35:45,140
Cause if you,

3720
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:48,140
if it snaps back and be like
catches Griff and then you know,

3721
01:35:48,141 --> 01:35:49,700
while you're already
in a turn like you can,

3722
01:35:49,730 --> 01:35:50,720
you can get fucked.

3723
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:51,950
Oh we drove.

3724
01:35:51,951 --> 01:35:56,330
It depends entirely on a car to those
cars are meant to be driven like that.

3725
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:58,190
Like Porsche's are notorious for like,

3726
01:35:58,220 --> 01:36:01,460
they have a weird weight bias cause
they were like an engine in the rear.

3727
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:03,500
So like when you're going around corners,

3728
01:36:03,501 --> 01:36:04,520
like sideways,

3729
01:36:04,521 --> 01:36:07,640
you're dealing with the physics
of this engine hanging out back.

3730
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:11,660
It's like 60% of the weight
is the ass end of the car.

3731
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:12,571
So,

3732
01:36:12,571 --> 01:36:12,780
you know,

3733
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:15,260
so if you had a friend who
came to you and was like,

3734
01:36:15,650 --> 01:36:15,981
man,

3735
01:36:15,981 --> 01:36:17,240
I just got my big deal.

3736
01:36:17,420 --> 01:36:18,141
Oh I need some,

3737
01:36:18,141 --> 01:36:19,130
I want to buy a car.

3738
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:21,670
So the one car would you get with it?

3739
01:36:21,670 --> 01:36:23,180
It depends on what kind
of a person he was.

3740
01:36:23,181 --> 01:36:24,014
A single dude.

3741
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:24,231
Yeah.

3742
01:36:24,231 --> 01:36:24,771
But is he,

3743
01:36:24,771 --> 01:36:25,790
is he an animal?

3744
01:36:25,820 --> 01:36:26,310
Is the,

3745
01:36:26,310 --> 01:36:26,810
uh,

3746
01:36:26,810 --> 01:36:29,180
it has to be a calm fellow that you know,

3747
01:36:29,220 --> 01:36:30,650
likes is comfortable car?

3748
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:30,901
No,

3749
01:36:30,901 --> 01:36:31,160
he's,

3750
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:31,993
you know who he is.

3751
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:35,210
He's a Dane Cook because I'm never
forget the conversation you over Dane,

3752
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:36,920
when Dana talked about his Maserati,

3753
01:36:36,921 --> 01:36:37,754
that was a lemon.

3754
01:36:38,030 --> 01:36:40,220
I'll never forget that because
I'm the kid wasn't a Maserati.

3755
01:36:40,221 --> 01:36:41,820
I think it was a Bentley.

3756
01:36:41,990 --> 01:36:42,823
No.

3757
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:43,690
Uh,

3758
01:36:43,690 --> 01:36:44,101
uh,

3759
01:36:44,101 --> 01:36:45,410
Aston Martin.

3760
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:45,671
Martin.

3761
01:36:45,671 --> 01:36:45,861
Yeah,

3762
01:36:45,861 --> 01:36:46,140
yeah,

3763
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:46,520
yeah.

3764
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:47,091
So like,

3765
01:36:47,091 --> 01:36:52,010
like if you could go back in time and
give Dayna Carter pickup to buy for like,

3766
01:36:52,011 --> 01:36:52,371
Hey man,

3767
01:36:52,371 --> 01:36:53,240
this is your first,

3768
01:36:53,241 --> 01:36:54,680
like this is a treat.

3769
01:36:54,681 --> 01:36:57,320
If you want to really well engineered car,

3770
01:36:57,321 --> 01:36:58,610
you can't go wrong with a Porsche.

3771
01:36:58,850 --> 01:37:00,500
They're just so well engineered.

3772
01:37:00,501 --> 01:37:02,960
It's up to your first Porsche that
you had that that was a hunk of shit.

3773
01:37:02,990 --> 01:37:03,271
Yeah,

3774
01:37:03,271 --> 01:37:05,830
it was a 411-NINE-ONE-1941.

3775
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:09,770
It was called a nine nine six,

3776
01:37:10,010 --> 01:37:11,120
nine nine six six.

3777
01:37:11,210 --> 01:37:15,530
It wasn't a six one one where he just
called ATNT want to find out what you owe.

3778
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:18,001
But yeah,

3779
01:37:18,001 --> 01:37:21,830
that I had one car that had five problems
with it in two years before I got rid

3780
01:37:21,831 --> 01:37:23,920
of it after a major problem.

3781
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:25,460
We had the best car after that.

3782
01:37:25,461 --> 01:37:27,710
I wish you still had that accurate NSX.

3783
01:37:27,850 --> 01:37:28,040
Yeah.

3784
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:31,040
That was like a fucking matchbox
car and I was so dope car.

3785
01:37:31,041 --> 01:37:31,910
They're coming out with a new one,

3786
01:37:31,911 --> 01:37:32,660
you know,

3787
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:34,910
accurate is ready to make a new a NSX.

3788
01:37:34,970 --> 01:37:37,490
I think it comes out in 2013 but they,

3789
01:37:37,491 --> 01:37:37,760
uh,

3790
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:39,140
had it in the Avengers.

3791
01:37:39,380 --> 01:37:41,450
Remember the car it gets in.

3792
01:37:41,470 --> 01:37:41,780
That's the,

3793
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:42,690
that was a prototype.

3794
01:37:42,780 --> 01:37:43,613
Yeah.

3795
01:37:44,630 --> 01:37:45,463
I know that shit.

3796
01:37:46,140 --> 01:37:49,460
Our Jaguar or Jaguars a girl cars,

3797
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:52,700
because I saw a Jaguar convertible the
other day and a girl was driving and I

3798
01:37:52,701 --> 01:37:53,090
was like,

3799
01:37:53,090 --> 01:37:53,391
damn,

3800
01:37:53,391 --> 01:37:56,400
that's so beautiful that God does it
have to be girl Jaguars are awesome,

3801
01:37:57,270 --> 01:37:58,103
beautiful Jaguar.

3802
01:37:58,530 --> 01:38:00,630
There's super powerful to the new ones.

3803
01:38:00,631 --> 01:38:01,464
They have these uh,

3804
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:02,880
x k asses.

3805
01:38:02,881 --> 01:38:03,560
I think it is.

3806
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:03,670
They,

3807
01:38:03,670 --> 01:38:05,700
they have like some
Beasley fucking cars now.

3808
01:38:05,701 --> 01:38:06,600
They're great cars,

3809
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:06,990
man.

3810
01:38:06,990 --> 01:38:07,823
Fuck yeah.

3811
01:38:08,220 --> 01:38:08,620
Yeah.

3812
01:38:08,620 --> 01:38:12,690
I would tell most for most people I
would say just get a well engineered car.

3813
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:16,740
Just don't really want a race car and
anything with the best fucking car around

3814
01:38:16,741 --> 01:38:18,300
right now is in my opinion,

3815
01:38:18,330 --> 01:38:19,260
dead serious.

3816
01:38:19,530 --> 01:38:21,900
Like for the money be a,

3817
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:24,560
what's the genesis the other day?

3818
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:25,440
Oh,

3819
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:26,880
the one that looks like a Mercedes

3820
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:29,733
car.

3821
01:38:30,870 --> 01:38:35,190
Hondai it puts out Hyundai Hondai
puts out a great fucking car.

3822
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:35,461
Well,

3823
01:38:35,461 --> 01:38:36,300
especially this one,

3824
01:38:36,301 --> 01:38:36,721
this one.

3825
01:38:36,721 --> 01:38:41,340
They've basically taken all the design
elements of Mercedes and Alexis.

3826
01:38:41,341 --> 01:38:45,300
They're like best costs essentially
made the same kind of car.

3827
01:38:45,510 --> 01:38:47,070
It's real fucking similar.

3828
01:38:47,310 --> 01:38:48,850
And they do a,

3829
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:49,950
it's a great car.

3830
01:38:49,950 --> 01:38:51,150
I mean it looks like a Mercedes.

3831
01:38:51,190 --> 01:38:52,023
It looks like a Mercedes.

3832
01:38:52,570 --> 01:38:53,590
All the shit in Mercedes.

3833
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:53,850
God,

3834
01:38:53,850 --> 01:38:56,910
it just doesn't have the like whatever
the thing that makes it a Mercedes is

3835
01:38:56,911 --> 01:38:58,110
$90,000.

3836
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:58,930
Well it's,

3837
01:38:58,930 --> 01:39:00,330
it's very high end.

3838
01:39:00,331 --> 01:39:00,720
They said,

3839
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:04,770
they said it's very comfortable to drive
and they're really reliable cars too.

3840
01:39:04,771 --> 01:39:07,770
You know the thing about Hyundai
is it's not like it's a shit car.

3841
01:39:08,270 --> 01:39:08,520
They're,

3842
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:10,020
they're reliable cars just as much.

3843
01:39:10,021 --> 01:39:10,690
So as a,

3844
01:39:10,690 --> 01:39:13,020
any other car that's in that price range,

3845
01:39:13,021 --> 01:39:14,010
but it's a pretty nice,

3846
01:39:14,011 --> 01:39:17,850
but like $34,000 a year
send to visually wise,

3847
01:39:17,851 --> 01:39:19,680
I don't think it's anything special.

3848
01:39:19,710 --> 01:39:20,840
Well neither is Alexis.

3849
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:23,270
Look at the Lexus ls
four 60 I think it is,

3850
01:39:23,271 --> 01:39:23,701
the new one,

3851
01:39:23,701 --> 01:39:24,330
whatever it is.

3852
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:25,111
Beautiful car.

3853
01:39:25,111 --> 01:39:26,400
But real set date,

3854
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:30,180
it's all about luxury is transportation
and those cars like Alexis,

3855
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:33,600
those cars are so quiet and peaceful.

3856
01:39:33,690 --> 01:39:34,081
I love,

3857
01:39:34,081 --> 01:39:34,440
it's like,

3858
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:34,980
yeah,

3859
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:36,090
if you're into that man,

3860
01:39:36,091 --> 01:39:37,140
I'd say get Alexis,

3861
01:39:37,141 --> 01:39:37,321
those,

3862
01:39:37,321 --> 01:39:38,130
Lexis,

3863
01:39:38,130 --> 01:39:39,660
those Lexus four doors.

3864
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:41,760
I like the most relaxing,

3865
01:39:41,761 --> 01:39:42,300
calm,

3866
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:43,800
they absorb bumps.

3867
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:44,190
They,

3868
01:39:44,190 --> 01:39:45,630
they're not handling cars.

3869
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:46,380
So the car,

3870
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:50,040
you're going to go around a corner on
the gas and get a fucking good feeling in

3871
01:39:50,041 --> 01:39:50,570
your balls.

3872
01:39:50,570 --> 01:39:52,680
I fucking on that care
about Gary Valentine.

3873
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:54,670
When we were working together on the expo,

3874
01:39:54,690 --> 01:39:58,290
had a green Lexus and his
whole thing was it Joe,

3875
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:02,730
you did it with a member and he had a
green Lexus and his whole thing was how

3876
01:40:02,731 --> 01:40:03,720
silent it was.

3877
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:04,310
Yeah,

3878
01:40:04,310 --> 01:40:05,360
we got the car one time,

3879
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:06,231
remembers it,

3880
01:40:06,231 --> 01:40:08,130
a country club called Robinson ranch.

3881
01:40:08,131 --> 01:40:08,311
Me,

3882
01:40:08,311 --> 01:40:10,890
Gary and I think it was
brother and a few other people.

3883
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:12,250
So what time we getting validated?

3884
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:14,350
We get into the car and he just
shuts the door and it looks at me.

3885
01:40:14,351 --> 01:40:14,850
He goes,

3886
01:40:14,850 --> 01:40:17,250
backi how fucking quiet as this car.

3887
01:40:17,870 --> 01:40:18,571
It was pretty quiet.

3888
01:40:18,571 --> 01:40:19,380
And he goes,

3889
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:19,831
it's pretty fun.

3890
01:40:19,831 --> 01:40:20,131
Quiet,

3891
01:40:20,131 --> 01:40:20,311
right?

3892
01:40:20,311 --> 01:40:20,551
And I go,

3893
01:40:20,551 --> 01:40:20,731
yeah.

3894
01:40:20,731 --> 01:40:21,031
And he goes,

3895
01:40:21,031 --> 01:40:21,541
put it in drive.

3896
01:40:21,541 --> 01:40:24,180
It's not fucking totally drunk.

3897
01:40:26,010 --> 01:40:27,230
Fucking Gary Valentine.

3898
01:40:27,231 --> 01:40:28,350
I missed that mother fucker.

3899
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:30,180
He do you remember Mike Burton?

3900
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:31,590
Burton,

3901
01:40:31,590 --> 01:40:32,423
Mike Burton.

3902
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:34,560
Where would I remember Mike Burton,

3903
01:40:34,590 --> 01:40:36,690
a comic from La,

3904
01:40:36,691 --> 01:40:39,720
hung around the comedy
comedy at the Improv.

3905
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:42,293
Krav Maga.

3906
01:40:42,690 --> 01:40:44,280
But I'm Mike Burden.

3907
01:40:44,310 --> 01:40:45,950
This is my favorite Gary Valentine story.

3908
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:46,641
I fucking it.

3909
01:40:46,641 --> 01:40:50,040
And I know that the mean
kind of Gary on one time.

3910
01:40:50,070 --> 01:40:51,180
Well love to God.

3911
01:40:51,181 --> 01:40:52,200
He's fucking funny.

3912
01:40:52,410 --> 01:40:54,100
So one time decide where we do the

3913
01:40:54,110 --> 01:40:54,371
show.

3914
01:40:54,371 --> 01:40:57,880
We wrap on Thursday and we decide we go
to for most of that drinks and I said to

3915
01:40:57,881 --> 01:40:58,151
Gary,

3916
01:40:58,151 --> 01:40:58,690
I go,

3917
01:40:58,690 --> 01:40:59,523
we should go to Vegas.

3918
01:40:59,530 --> 01:41:00,011
And he was like,

3919
01:41:00,011 --> 01:41:00,844
let's do it.

3920
01:41:00,970 --> 01:41:01,690
And uh,

3921
01:41:01,690 --> 01:41:05,620
we look at Mike Burden and
a and which one's that?

3922
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:07,653
That's my partner.

3923
01:41:07,740 --> 01:41:08,570
Yeah,

3924
01:41:08,570 --> 01:41:09,340
you don't mind.

3925
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:09,701
So,

3926
01:41:09,701 --> 01:41:11,650
so we go to him and Scott Henry and go,

3927
01:41:11,651 --> 01:41:12,610
let's go to fucking Vegas.

3928
01:41:12,611 --> 01:41:14,230
And Mike Bergner's isn't
that I don't want to go.

3929
01:41:14,410 --> 01:41:15,610
I want to come on Burton go.

3930
01:41:15,611 --> 01:41:15,970
And he's like,

3931
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:16,091
ah,

3932
01:41:16,091 --> 01:41:17,020
I don't want to go and carry goes,

3933
01:41:17,021 --> 01:41:17,740
fuck you.

3934
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:18,573
This is the problem to you.

3935
01:41:18,610 --> 01:41:19,181
You need to go.

3936
01:41:19,181 --> 01:41:19,540
And he's like,

3937
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:19,750
ah,

3938
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:20,261
I don't want to go.

3939
01:41:20,261 --> 01:41:21,700
I got a spot at the Hollywood improv.

3940
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:22,870
Fuck the Hollywood improv.

3941
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:23,531
So here he goes,

3942
01:41:23,531 --> 01:41:23,831
fuck it.

3943
01:41:23,831 --> 01:41:24,910
You guys work on Burton?

3944
01:41:25,030 --> 01:41:26,200
I'm going to go back to Santa Monica.

3945
01:41:26,201 --> 01:41:26,770
He's living with Kevin.

3946
01:41:26,770 --> 01:41:27,370
At the time.

3947
01:41:27,370 --> 01:41:28,810
I'm gonna go back to Santa
Monica and get my shit.

3948
01:41:28,930 --> 01:41:30,580
I'll meet you at Burton and Henry's house.

3949
01:41:30,581 --> 01:41:30,881
Let me go.

3950
01:41:30,881 --> 01:41:31,690
Perfect.

3951
01:41:31,690 --> 01:41:32,800
So we go and I'm awake.

3952
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,060
Some Scott Henry's house,

3953
01:41:34,210 --> 01:41:35,080
we decide,

3954
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:37,270
we convince Burton and Burton goes,

3955
01:41:37,271 --> 01:41:37,460
man,

3956
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:37,810
I fucking,

3957
01:41:37,810 --> 01:41:38,680
I'll go and I go,

3958
01:41:38,681 --> 01:41:39,790
burden is a great idea.

3959
01:41:40,210 --> 01:41:44,140
Why don't you hang out in the back of my
truck hide and we'll tell big Gary that

3960
01:41:44,141 --> 01:41:44,974
you're not going.

3961
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:47,170
And then we'll get on the interstate
will surprise him and be like,

3962
01:41:47,171 --> 01:41:47,441
Gary,

3963
01:41:47,441 --> 01:41:47,621
look,

3964
01:41:47,621 --> 01:41:48,970
he's coming because Gary's not witness.

3965
01:41:48,971 --> 01:41:49,810
He's back in the shit.

3966
01:41:50,050 --> 01:41:50,471
Burton goes,

3967
01:41:50,471 --> 01:41:50,861
that's great.

3968
01:41:50,861 --> 01:41:51,611
So we packed all our shit.

3969
01:41:51,611 --> 01:41:53,200
We got out of Burton and Henry's house.

3970
01:41:53,930 --> 01:41:55,360
Burton gets in the way back at the truck,

3971
01:41:55,660 --> 01:41:56,860
like back with the beers are,

3972
01:41:57,020 --> 01:42:01,060
I had an expedition at the time and he
hides back there and we wait for like 15

3973
01:42:01,061 --> 01:42:02,920
minutes and all of a sudden
Gary Valentine shows up.

3974
01:42:03,310 --> 01:42:03,911
He shows up,

3975
01:42:03,911 --> 01:42:04,744
he's got his bags,

3976
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:05,800
he's holding his hands.

3977
01:42:05,801 --> 01:42:08,620
He opens the backseat door
like the middle opens,

3978
01:42:08,630 --> 01:42:09,011
hops in.

3979
01:42:09,011 --> 01:42:09,340
He goes,

3980
01:42:09,340 --> 01:42:09,971
where's Burton?

3981
01:42:09,971 --> 01:42:10,301
And we're like,

3982
01:42:10,301 --> 01:42:12,280
he didn't come and he
shuts the door and he goes,

3983
01:42:12,670 --> 01:42:14,080
let me tell you what's wrong
with that motherfucker.

3984
01:42:15,310 --> 01:42:16,000
And we're like,

3985
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:16,661
uh,

3986
01:42:16,661 --> 01:42:17,111
and then he goes,

3987
01:42:17,111 --> 01:42:20,200
and I'll tell you why you shouldn't be
a comic anymore cause he's not fucking

3988
01:42:20,201 --> 01:42:20,920
funny.

3989
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:22,300
And as we drive,

3990
01:42:22,390 --> 01:42:23,540
we're pulling out and I see,

3991
01:42:23,740 --> 01:42:28,510
I see Mike Burton sit up in the weight
back and Gary talked for like 10 fucking

3992
01:42:28,511 --> 01:42:29,080
minutes,

3993
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:30,280
just talk shit about.

3994
01:42:32,050 --> 01:42:34,000
And all of a sudden I go,

3995
01:42:34,001 --> 01:42:34,601
hey Gary,

3996
01:42:34,601 --> 01:42:36,220
would you mind passing
me a beer into the back?

3997
01:42:36,221 --> 01:42:37,120
And he turns around and he goes,

3998
01:42:37,121 --> 01:42:37,840
Hey Burton.

3999
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:38,561
Then turns back to us.

4000
01:42:38,561 --> 01:42:39,394
He goes,

4001
01:42:39,610 --> 01:42:40,660
when we get to fucking tell me,

4002
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:42,100
we were like,

4003
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:42,431
oh,

4004
01:42:42,431 --> 01:42:43,780
there was never a good time.

4005
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:47,510
It was the fucking most sane.

4006
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:49,090
Oh God,

4007
01:42:49,230 --> 01:42:49,960
I'll never,

4008
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:50,793
and they talked,

4009
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,150
me and Scott Henry Sat in the front,

4010
01:42:52,420 --> 01:42:56,230
Gary Valentine and Mike Burton sign in
the back and talked like hashed it out.

4011
01:42:56,231 --> 01:42:56,620
Like,

4012
01:42:56,620 --> 01:42:57,650
how do you hash that out?

4013
01:42:57,651 --> 01:42:57,860
Yeah,

4014
01:42:57,860 --> 01:42:58,360
right.

4015
01:42:58,360 --> 01:42:58,870
I think Bert,

4016
01:42:58,870 --> 01:42:59,140
I don't know,

4017
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:00,160
burden the burden.

4018
01:43:00,310 --> 01:43:02,170
I think he's teaching Krav Maga now.

4019
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:02,450
Yeah.

4020
01:43:02,450 --> 01:43:02,850
Yes.

4021
01:43:02,850 --> 01:43:03,060
Yeah.

4022
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:04,750
The guy's done training centers now.

4023
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:06,640
He's a really smart dude.

4024
01:43:06,770 --> 01:43:07,470
Comedy's not fair.

4025
01:43:07,470 --> 01:43:08,303
Everybody fucks

4026
01:43:10,410 --> 01:43:11,320
Krav Maga is Jewish,

4027
01:43:11,321 --> 01:43:12,070
right?

4028
01:43:12,070 --> 01:43:12,431
Yes.

4029
01:43:12,431 --> 01:43:16,390
Is there is really a sort of system of
self defense based on a lot of different

4030
01:43:16,391 --> 01:43:17,111
marsh slapping,

4031
01:43:17,111 --> 01:43:17,590
right?

4032
01:43:17,590 --> 01:43:19,230
It's Jewish slapping.

4033
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:19,671
No,

4034
01:43:19,671 --> 01:43:19,971
no,

4035
01:43:19,971 --> 01:43:20,380
no.

4036
01:43:20,380 --> 01:43:22,720
Let me just whittle it down
to what I heard it was okay.

4037
01:43:23,020 --> 01:43:24,580
Is Jewish bitch slapping?

4038
01:43:24,610 --> 01:43:24,851
Yeah,

4039
01:43:24,851 --> 01:43:28,810
that's what I heard from some new Jeremy.

4040
01:43:29,220 --> 01:43:34,000
No crop of guys like Oh fuck from
a guy that listens to this podcast.

4041
01:43:34,001 --> 01:43:35,290
It's at my daughter's dance class.

4042
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:36,460
He told you was slapping.

4043
01:43:36,461 --> 01:43:38,160
No Fuck nevermind.

4044
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:39,310
I wish I hadn't said this.

4045
01:43:43,810 --> 01:43:44,200
Yeah,

4046
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:46,470
don't settle down birds.

4047
01:43:46,780 --> 01:43:47,610
No crop.

4048
01:43:47,610 --> 01:43:49,990
The guy's legit legit
form of self defense.

4049
01:43:49,991 --> 01:43:51,010
I might mostly,

4050
01:43:51,710 --> 01:43:52,040
you know

4051
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:52,873
like um,

4052
01:43:53,390 --> 01:43:57,350
you know it's like street stuff like
show you a correct that vacations of

4053
01:43:57,351 --> 01:44:01,430
techniques and self defense situations
as opposed to like just doing Jujitsu or

4054
01:44:01,431 --> 01:44:03,560
just doing kickboxing or
something along those lines.

4055
01:44:03,710 --> 01:44:06,050
It's more applicable to
like getting attacked.

4056
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:06,620
It's,

4057
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:09,330
but it's all the basic
techniques of a all,

4058
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:09,771
you know,

4059
01:44:09,771 --> 01:44:11,000
all the effective martial arts.

4060
01:44:11,001 --> 01:44:11,211
You know,

4061
01:44:11,211 --> 01:44:11,420
they,

4062
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:12,740
they go over choke,

4063
01:44:12,741 --> 01:44:14,120
hold to go over arm locks,

4064
01:44:14,121 --> 01:44:14,954
they go over,

4065
01:44:15,020 --> 01:44:15,231
you know,

4066
01:44:15,231 --> 01:44:16,100
all sorts of different,

4067
01:44:16,310 --> 01:44:17,480
it's not just,

4068
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:18,111
you know,

4069
01:44:18,111 --> 01:44:19,430
a self defense.

4070
01:44:19,431 --> 01:44:19,771
They,

4071
01:44:19,771 --> 01:44:19,911
they,

4072
01:44:19,911 --> 01:44:22,040
they incorporate a lot
of different things.

4073
01:44:22,041 --> 01:44:23,060
It's like a system of,

4074
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:23,481
you know,

4075
01:44:23,481 --> 01:44:26,810
taking like what's the most useful
martial arts in a real life situation.

4076
01:44:27,180 --> 01:44:28,040
So that's what it is,

4077
01:44:28,630 --> 01:44:29,120
which is,

4078
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:29,331
you know,

4079
01:44:29,331 --> 01:44:30,170
there's room for that.

4080
01:44:30,570 --> 01:44:30,960
I'm,

4081
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:32,960
I'm personally of the school that,

4082
01:44:32,990 --> 01:44:33,291
you know,

4083
01:44:33,291 --> 01:44:34,124
like people say,

4084
01:44:34,270 --> 01:44:34,631
well we,

4085
01:44:34,631 --> 01:44:34,840
like,

4086
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:34,971
I,

4087
01:44:34,971 --> 01:44:38,750
I've had these arguments with the so
called Lake Street defense people and

4088
01:44:38,751 --> 01:44:38,961
they're like,

4089
01:44:38,961 --> 01:44:39,091
well,

4090
01:44:39,091 --> 01:44:40,050
we learn is a,

4091
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:41,750
how to defend yourself on the street.

4092
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:42,261
You know,

4093
01:44:42,261 --> 01:44:43,940
it was a no rules on the street.

4094
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:44,891
And in the,

4095
01:44:44,891 --> 01:44:46,850
the mixed martial arts Dojo,

4096
01:44:46,851 --> 01:44:47,121
you know,

4097
01:44:47,121 --> 01:44:48,680
there's rules and that's
all well and good.

4098
01:44:48,681 --> 01:44:49,720
We appreciate the discipline,

4099
01:44:49,730 --> 01:44:50,563
but there's no rules,

4100
01:44:50,630 --> 01:44:51,860
there's no rules on the street.

4101
01:44:52,190 --> 01:44:54,080
So that's why I support is different.

4102
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:54,651
You know,

4103
01:44:54,651 --> 01:44:54,871
something,

4104
01:44:54,871 --> 01:44:57,680
I like to try to bite you and grab
your balls or something like that.

4105
01:44:58,640 --> 01:44:59,300
But my,

4106
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:03,920
my take has always been that the most
effective techniques aren't the techniques

4107
01:45:03,921 --> 01:45:06,950
that work on people who don't know what
they're doing and all the techniques,

4108
01:45:06,980 --> 01:45:08,090
almost all of them.

4109
01:45:08,150 --> 01:45:10,760
And that you see in so-called
self defense courses,

4110
01:45:11,090 --> 01:45:12,910
they only work if people
don't know what they're doing.

4111
01:45:12,940 --> 01:45:15,420
Like the all the grabbing
hands and pulling in you,

4112
01:45:15,430 --> 01:45:16,850
you ain't grab my hand bench.

4113
01:45:17,150 --> 01:45:17,530
You know,

4114
01:45:17,530 --> 01:45:17,830
I'm,

4115
01:45:17,830 --> 01:45:19,280
I'm going to be a wild cat.

4116
01:45:19,310 --> 01:45:19,700
We've got,

4117
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:22,310
we've got some crazy shit going on right
here and you're not grabbing me and

4118
01:45:22,311 --> 01:45:23,060
just holding on to me.

4119
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:23,930
That's nonsense.

4120
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:24,761
And so when,

4121
01:45:24,761 --> 01:45:27,020
when I see any of that
self defense nonsense,

4122
01:45:27,021 --> 01:45:27,350
I go,

4123
01:45:27,350 --> 01:45:28,730
there's a reason why this doesn't work.

4124
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:29,930
And the reason why it doesn't work,

4125
01:45:29,931 --> 01:45:31,160
it's because it doesn't work on a killer.

4126
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:32,091
You need to,

4127
01:45:32,091 --> 01:45:33,830
everything you need to do.

4128
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:35,930
And if you wanted to
learn true martial arts,

4129
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:38,330
you should learn what works on killers.

4130
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:41,570
Learn what works on the
best fighters on the planet.

4131
01:45:41,571 --> 01:45:43,220
Learn what works on Moitai finders.

4132
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:46,460
Learn what works on a Jujitsu fighter is
learn what works on a guy who knows how

4133
01:45:46,461 --> 01:45:49,640
to fuck people up and he's
been training in it for years.

4134
01:45:49,910 --> 01:45:51,500
You learn how to deal with that guy.

4135
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:54,650
Don't learn how to deal with some dude
like pulling out your keys and going for

4136
01:45:54,651 --> 01:45:55,430
his eyes.

4137
01:45:55,430 --> 01:45:58,310
Cause most likely he'll knock you the
fuck out before you get close enough to do

4138
01:45:58,311 --> 01:45:59,144
that.

4139
01:45:59,900 --> 01:46:03,410
Learn how to do what works on killers.

4140
01:46:03,650 --> 01:46:04,730
That's my opinion.

4141
01:46:05,450 --> 01:46:05,871
So I don't,

4142
01:46:05,871 --> 01:46:08,450
I'm not a big believer
in self defense courses.

4143
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:10,340
I'm a big believer in martial arts.

4144
01:46:10,341 --> 01:46:11,060
I think you,

4145
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:12,290
if you want to learn Jujitsu,

4146
01:46:12,291 --> 01:46:15,740
you should learn the type of Jujitsu
where you know if you get ahold of someone

4147
01:46:15,741 --> 01:46:16,670
it doesn't matter.

4148
01:46:16,970 --> 01:46:17,600
That's it.

4149
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:17,811
You,

4150
01:46:17,811 --> 01:46:18,740
you own them now.

4151
01:46:18,770 --> 01:46:21,110
That's your world and you
strangled them and you,

4152
01:46:21,111 --> 01:46:22,550
you get to that point and that's a,

4153
01:46:22,551 --> 01:46:25,730
that's a beautiful tool
to have in your toolbox.

4154
01:46:25,731 --> 01:46:26,940
It's a beautiful thing to,

4155
01:46:27,210 --> 01:46:27,530
to,

4156
01:46:27,530 --> 01:46:27,800
to,

4157
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:29,090
to be in possession of.

4158
01:46:29,210 --> 01:46:32,120
Marshall childs was saying that you
don't ever get that if you're in a self

4159
01:46:32,121 --> 01:46:33,590
defense course because first of all,

4160
01:46:33,591 --> 01:46:35,650
you're not going to have the amount of uh,

4161
01:46:35,810 --> 01:46:39,470
proficiency and doing these techniques
like knee brakes and attacks to the

4162
01:46:39,471 --> 01:46:42,530
ground cause you're not really doing them
full blast and training against people

4163
01:46:42,531 --> 01:46:43,364
who were resisting.

4164
01:46:43,550 --> 01:46:44,450
So a lot of what you're doing,

4165
01:46:44,451 --> 01:46:47,120
you're drilling repetition and you
might get better at completing those

4166
01:46:47,121 --> 01:46:47,691
movements,

4167
01:46:47,691 --> 01:46:51,180
but the odds of doing it on
a guy who knows how to fight,

4168
01:46:51,181 --> 01:46:52,440
it's pretty fucking small.

4169
01:46:52,650 --> 01:46:53,483
Yeah.

4170
01:46:53,610 --> 01:46:54,810
Anderson Silva type dude,

4171
01:46:54,870 --> 01:46:57,780
knock your fucking dome off
your neck and it's that simple.

4172
01:46:57,990 --> 01:46:58,171
You know,

4173
01:46:58,171 --> 01:47:01,160
you're never going to get to eye
gouge him is going to light you up.

4174
01:47:01,270 --> 01:47:04,620
And it's like you've got
to look at it that way.

4175
01:47:04,621 --> 01:47:04,820
I,

4176
01:47:04,820 --> 01:47:05,611
in my opinion.

4177
01:47:05,611 --> 01:47:07,200
And so there's nothing
wrong with crop them.

4178
01:47:07,201 --> 01:47:07,560
God,

4179
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:08,730
it's a good way to work out.

4180
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:09,810
It's a good way to train,

4181
01:47:10,040 --> 01:47:10,320
you know,

4182
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:12,420
and it's a very effective
system in martial arts.

4183
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:16,490
Do you mean you worked with Marshall
at the laugh laughing school?

4184
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:17,100
Uh Huh.

4185
01:47:17,100 --> 01:47:17,440
Yeah,

4186
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:18,080
he does.

4187
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:18,381
He did.

4188
01:47:18,381 --> 01:47:20,270
He talk to you about more a Jujitsu?

4189
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:20,840
No,

4190
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:21,740
he does Jiu Jitsu.

4191
01:47:21,770 --> 01:47:22,040
Yeah,

4192
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:22,851
like aggressive.

4193
01:47:22,851 --> 01:47:23,900
We talked a little bit about it,

4194
01:47:24,050 --> 01:47:24,561
but he's,

4195
01:47:24,561 --> 01:47:25,520
he's definitely,

4196
01:47:25,521 --> 01:47:26,210
uh,

4197
01:47:26,210 --> 01:47:27,350
he said that exact same thing,

4198
01:47:27,351 --> 01:47:30,830
that it just was like a nice set of,

4199
01:47:31,330 --> 01:47:32,163
um,

4200
01:47:32,540 --> 01:47:36,410
abilities to have in place and that he
get became more relaxed around people.

4201
01:47:36,730 --> 01:47:37,240
He never,

4202
01:47:37,240 --> 01:47:38,240
because he was smaller,

4203
01:47:38,370 --> 01:47:39,860
not smaller but smaller,

4204
01:47:40,100 --> 01:47:43,550
and he just never felt like he could
ever get hurt because he knew how to get

4205
01:47:43,551 --> 01:47:44,240
out of it.

4206
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:44,541
Well,

4207
01:47:44,541 --> 01:47:44,781
you know,

4208
01:47:44,781 --> 01:47:45,620
you can still get hurt.

4209
01:47:45,650 --> 01:47:46,550
You got to always be

4210
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:47,051
careful.

4211
01:47:47,051 --> 01:47:47,351
People,

4212
01:47:47,351 --> 01:47:47,681
this is the,

4213
01:47:47,681 --> 01:47:48,071
first of all,

4214
01:47:48,071 --> 01:47:52,360
there's knives and guns and
gangs and sticks and you know,

4215
01:47:52,361 --> 01:47:53,171
you can always get hurt.

4216
01:47:53,171 --> 01:47:55,690
Like the idea that you were in vulnerable
now and you can just walk through any

4217
01:47:55,691 --> 01:47:56,800
bad neighborhood is crazy,

4218
01:47:57,070 --> 01:47:57,460
you know?

4219
01:47:57,460 --> 01:48:00,040
But the less,

4220
01:48:00,590 --> 01:48:04,660
you certainly have less apprehensions
because you know that you've reached a

4221
01:48:04,661 --> 01:48:08,050
physical proficiency when it comes to
defending yourself that very few people

4222
01:48:08,051 --> 01:48:08,884
have ever reached.

4223
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:10,180
So if some shit goes down,

4224
01:48:10,181 --> 01:48:11,590
most likely you're going to be fine.

4225
01:48:12,020 --> 01:48:12,461
Most likely,

4226
01:48:12,461 --> 01:48:14,200
this guy's in for some horrible,

4227
01:48:14,201 --> 01:48:15,040
rude awakening,

4228
01:48:15,430 --> 01:48:17,380
which most people don't
know how to fight her into.

4229
01:48:17,410 --> 01:48:17,830
If they,

4230
01:48:17,830 --> 01:48:19,590
if they get in there with a
guy who knows how to fight,

4231
01:48:19,970 --> 01:48:22,840
they're in for a terrifying awakening
of what's the difference between,

4232
01:48:22,841 --> 01:48:26,200
so I want to spend zero time training
out of fine and someone has dedicated a

4233
01:48:26,201 --> 01:48:29,590
lifetime of doing it as a different
[inaudible] guys going to own you.

4234
01:48:29,650 --> 01:48:32,350
And it's a terrifying feeling
to get owned by someone,

4235
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:34,120
especially if you get
on in the straight man.

4236
01:48:34,150 --> 01:48:34,983
Whew.

4237
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:37,600
Especially if you get onto to the street
and you're the one that started it.

4238
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:38,800
Oh,

4239
01:48:38,850 --> 01:48:39,720
it's like that video.

4240
01:48:39,721 --> 01:48:40,440
That dude,

4241
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:40,910
oh,

4242
01:48:40,910 --> 01:48:45,270
the two kids where it's like a Mexican
kid with his socks pulled up to his knees

4243
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:47,610
and there's some white kid
in jeans and they're like,

4244
01:48:47,611 --> 01:48:47,971
come on.

4245
01:48:47,971 --> 01:48:48,804
And then the white,

4246
01:48:48,810 --> 01:48:52,680
the white kid clearly knows
like some sort of Asian defense,

4247
01:48:52,710 --> 01:48:55,490
like starts doing steps and
kicking practice kick in.

4248
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:56,221
And the guy was like,

4249
01:48:56,221 --> 01:48:56,461
no,

4250
01:48:56,461 --> 01:48:58,030
no street fight street fight only.

4251
01:48:58,410 --> 01:48:58,920
And it was like,

4252
01:48:58,920 --> 01:48:59,071
no,

4253
01:48:59,071 --> 01:48:59,581
this is what I'm doing.

4254
01:48:59,581 --> 01:48:59,851
And he's like,

4255
01:48:59,851 --> 01:49:00,031
no,

4256
01:49:00,031 --> 01:49:00,481
no man.

4257
01:49:00,481 --> 01:49:01,470
I ain't doing that kind of shit.

4258
01:49:01,620 --> 01:49:02,330
No funky vice,

4259
01:49:02,330 --> 01:49:03,300
just regular fights.

4260
01:49:05,010 --> 01:49:05,880
It's all mine is on my,

4261
01:49:05,881 --> 01:49:08,550
it's one of my favorite fights I've
favorited and all that youtube page,

4262
01:49:08,551 --> 01:49:12,810
like I favorited it that I'm fucking one
of the first people to discover Kimbo

4263
01:49:12,811 --> 01:49:13,380
slice.

4264
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:14,750
You know the beautiful
thing about being around

4265
01:49:14,780 --> 01:49:17,100
people know how to fight isn't
very rarely getting flights.

4266
01:49:17,190 --> 01:49:19,870
It's most people know how to
fight our fucking pretty calm.

4267
01:49:19,910 --> 01:49:21,640
They'd get all that shit out in the gym.

4268
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:22,120
You know,

4269
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:24,190
you can get all that shit out
in a controlled environment.

4270
01:49:24,191 --> 01:49:26,710
We have a desire for conflict.

4271
01:49:26,711 --> 01:49:28,570
We have a desire to
fucking old come things,

4272
01:49:28,650 --> 01:49:29,483
fuck the car.

4273
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:30,910
There's a desire of that,

4274
01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:33,190
that all that shit can
be erased in the gym.

4275
01:49:33,220 --> 01:49:34,810
And when you erase it to the gym,

4276
01:49:34,990 --> 01:49:39,100
you deal with yourself on an even playing
field instead of being overwhelmed by

4277
01:49:39,101 --> 01:49:43,120
road rage or overwhelmed by disappointment
in your own personal life and

4278
01:49:43,121 --> 01:49:46,390
existence and whatever's frustrations
that have been building inside of you,

4279
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:49,420
percolating fucking up
your physical existence.

4280
01:49:49,421 --> 01:49:50,300
Because the moment you're in,

4281
01:49:50,301 --> 01:49:51,160
in any interaction,

4282
01:49:51,161 --> 01:49:52,630
you're acting unbalanced.

4283
01:49:52,870 --> 01:49:53,290
You know,

4284
01:49:53,290 --> 01:49:56,160
walking down the street on
the curb just staring at cars.

4285
01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:56,410
Yeah.

4286
01:49:56,410 --> 01:49:57,430
The Fuck's wrong with you?

4287
01:49:58,660 --> 01:50:00,070
That's the guy from yet last night,

4288
01:50:00,550 --> 01:50:01,190
what was he doing?

4289
01:50:01,190 --> 01:50:02,480
Saw Him walking on the curb,

4290
01:50:02,580 --> 01:50:04,960
just staring at cars and I was like,

4291
01:50:04,961 --> 01:50:05,830
he's probably crazy.

4292
01:50:05,831 --> 01:50:07,420
Chick was just walking on the,

4293
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:08,980
on the sidewalk and I was like,

4294
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:10,120
man,

4295
01:50:10,120 --> 01:50:11,200
maybe they're all mapped out.

4296
01:50:11,330 --> 01:50:11,590
Yeah.

4297
01:50:11,590 --> 01:50:14,000
You don't want to chicks getting
street fights with their dudes.

4298
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:15,970
You got together and fuck
a throw down together.

4299
01:50:16,490 --> 01:50:17,323
Go home and fuck.

4300
01:50:17,350 --> 01:50:18,183
Does that happen?

4301
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:18,450
I said,

4302
01:50:18,450 --> 01:50:19,283
Dina,

4303
01:50:19,700 --> 01:50:20,710
I didn't like a movie.

4304
01:50:20,711 --> 01:50:21,544
Right.

4305
01:50:22,860 --> 01:50:24,280
Streetfighter yeah,

4306
01:50:24,281 --> 01:50:25,091
something along those lines.

4307
01:50:25,091 --> 01:50:25,924
Right?

4308
01:50:27,020 --> 01:50:27,853
I don't know.

4309
01:50:28,290 --> 01:50:29,140
I can't imagine.

4310
01:50:29,141 --> 01:50:32,620
I've never been able to with a girl that
fought conversation went south hard.

4311
01:50:32,910 --> 01:50:34,780
How many smuggling you
never been around a girl.

4312
01:50:35,050 --> 01:50:35,791
What's up with that?

4313
01:50:35,791 --> 01:50:37,180
You haven't been around a
girl that likes to fight.

4314
01:50:37,540 --> 01:50:39,490
No shit ever.

4315
01:50:39,491 --> 01:50:40,120
Man.

4316
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:41,430
Girls don't want to drag you into fights.

4317
01:50:41,680 --> 01:50:42,610
That's one of the scariest things.

4318
01:50:42,611 --> 01:50:43,410
You get everything on try.

4319
01:50:43,410 --> 01:50:45,550
I would imagine you would have attract
that when you were younger though.

4320
01:50:45,630 --> 01:50:46,030
Yeah,

4321
01:50:46,030 --> 01:50:46,631
a lot of them.

4322
01:50:46,631 --> 01:50:46,871
Yeah.

4323
01:50:46,871 --> 01:50:47,351
They want to stick.

4324
01:50:47,351 --> 01:50:51,760
You want people like a dog versus good
behind the scenes stories about you that

4325
01:50:51,761 --> 01:50:54,640
I fucking dying to talk
about behind the scenes.

4326
01:50:54,641 --> 01:50:54,820
Yeah.

4327
01:50:54,820 --> 01:50:55,421
Like just like,

4328
01:50:55,421 --> 01:50:56,254
just like,

4329
01:50:56,290 --> 01:50:57,123
uh,

4330
01:50:57,370 --> 01:50:57,820
yeah.

4331
01:50:57,820 --> 01:50:58,470
I don't know.

4332
01:50:58,470 --> 01:50:59,460
It's fucking not,

4333
01:50:59,461 --> 01:51:00,310
why did I say that?

4334
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:02,230
Your ego does attic.

4335
01:51:02,290 --> 01:51:02,460
No,

4336
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:02,581
no,

4337
01:51:02,581 --> 01:51:02,721
no,

4338
01:51:02,721 --> 01:51:02,861
no,

4339
01:51:02,861 --> 01:51:03,011
no.

4340
01:51:03,011 --> 01:51:03,970
But it has to do with violence.

4341
01:51:03,971 --> 01:51:05,230
It's almost nothing.

4342
01:51:05,231 --> 01:51:06,340
So nothing about violence.

4343
01:51:06,341 --> 01:51:10,120
It's about you being a friend
of Dan's like uh oh yeah,

4344
01:51:10,150 --> 01:51:10,601
let's not,

4345
01:51:10,601 --> 01:51:12,750
what if it's bad people don't
talk about about people.

4346
01:51:12,810 --> 01:51:13,481
Oh God damn.

4347
01:51:13,481 --> 01:51:15,040
I don't know why I'm fucking,

4348
01:51:15,430 --> 01:51:15,850
something's wrong.

4349
01:51:15,850 --> 01:51:16,421
My brain.

4350
01:51:16,421 --> 01:51:17,740
Something's wrong with Berg.

4351
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:20,070
Bryan Bryan series.

4352
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:20,820
What's wrong?

4353
01:51:20,820 --> 01:51:21,850
What happened with was your thing,

4354
01:51:21,851 --> 01:51:23,440
you can't smoke weed in
front of cameras anymore.

4355
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:23,651
Yeah,

4356
01:51:23,651 --> 01:51:25,690
you can kind of be sneaky about it.

4357
01:51:25,750 --> 01:51:26,170
Okay.

4358
01:51:26,170 --> 01:51:26,770
It's stupid.

4359
01:51:26,770 --> 01:51:28,690
You stream has some sort of policy.

4360
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:28,871
Yeah,

4361
01:51:28,871 --> 01:51:31,420
we have like vaporizer and still
have them while taking a hit.

4362
01:51:31,421 --> 01:51:32,060
Joe,

4363
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:32,990
why do you yeah,

4364
01:51:33,140 --> 01:51:34,210
let's just wrap this bitch up.

4365
01:51:34,211 --> 01:51:36,700
Cause you know you guys came a little
late and I still have to look at that

4366
01:51:36,701 --> 01:51:37,320
property,

4367
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:37,820
right.

4368
01:51:37,820 --> 01:51:40,120
We'll go with you pretending
where your investors,

4369
01:51:40,150 --> 01:51:40,983
that's,

4370
01:51:41,010 --> 01:51:43,120
I'm looking at that and find an allergist.

4371
01:51:43,121 --> 01:51:44,620
They inspect really bullshit stuff.

4372
01:51:44,650 --> 01:51:45,150
Let's do it.

4373
01:51:45,150 --> 01:51:47,470
But I don't know about the fault lines,

4374
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:49,630
things that make you go.

4375
01:51:52,660 --> 01:51:53,021
So,

4376
01:51:53,021 --> 01:51:53,650
uh,

4377
01:51:53,650 --> 01:51:58,650
next week in the podcast we've got Shane
Smith Bassnectar and the great bobcat

4378
01:51:58,940 --> 01:52:01,530
Goldthwait should be very fun.

4379
01:52:01,570 --> 01:52:01,780
Yeah,

4380
01:52:01,780 --> 01:52:04,450
we'll have a great talk about Barry Katz.

4381
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:05,651
Bob Has,

4382
01:52:05,651 --> 01:52:06,131
oh Harry,

4383
01:52:06,131 --> 01:52:07,690
since he was fucking a child,

4384
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:08,560
he's known Berenson.

4385
01:52:08,570 --> 01:52:11,860
Susan bobcat lived in Barry's closet.

4386
01:52:12,220 --> 01:52:14,050
Is the story like very owned.

4387
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:16,560
I had a closet that he rented out in a,

4388
01:52:16,570 --> 01:52:17,403
in uh,

4389
01:52:17,860 --> 01:52:19,830
I'm sure I'm raping this right.

4390
01:52:20,020 --> 01:52:25,020
Bob Barry rented out a closet in like
Boston University or Boston College.

4391
01:52:25,151 --> 01:52:25,600
Right.

4392
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:28,210
And bobcat rented it when he was like 16.

4393
01:52:28,660 --> 01:52:29,140
Wow.

4394
01:52:29,140 --> 01:52:29,380
Yeah.

4395
01:52:29,380 --> 01:52:29,651
Bob.

4396
01:52:29,651 --> 01:52:32,970
Bob Cats don't bury for every
bobcat's another Boston comic.

4397
01:52:33,010 --> 01:52:33,940
People don't realize,

4398
01:52:33,941 --> 01:52:34,151
you know,

4399
01:52:34,151 --> 01:52:35,560
he made it on the big screen,

4400
01:52:35,590 --> 01:52:36,160
you know,

4401
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:36,520
uh,

4402
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:39,460
and made it sort of almost
as like a Hollywood guy.

4403
01:52:39,461 --> 01:52:42,610
But his origins are in
Boston too and as fuck.

4404
01:52:42,700 --> 01:52:42,971
Oh yeah.

4405
01:52:42,971 --> 01:52:44,960
He was bobcat's always
been fucking hilarious.

4406
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:50,050
Ever hear the CD meet Bob met Bob and
it's like hamburger is made at with a

4407
01:52:51,021 --> 01:52:51,860
hamburger or something like that.

4408
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:52,970
He's a,

4409
01:52:52,970 --> 01:52:53,190
yeah,

4410
01:52:53,190 --> 01:52:53,910
he's great.

4411
01:52:53,910 --> 01:52:54,150
He's,

4412
01:52:54,150 --> 01:52:54,980
he's great.

4413
01:52:54,980 --> 01:52:58,910
Bob Bobcat Goldthwait like
with bobcat being a character.

4414
01:52:58,911 --> 01:52:59,601
It's really weird.

4415
01:52:59,601 --> 01:52:59,751
Like,

4416
01:52:59,751 --> 01:52:59,961
you know,

4417
01:52:59,961 --> 01:53:02,530
like that guy that's,

4418
01:53:02,980 --> 01:53:03,340
yeah.

4419
01:53:03,340 --> 01:53:05,270
I wonder if he feels weird about that.

4420
01:53:05,330 --> 01:53:05,581
But one,

4421
01:53:05,581 --> 01:53:06,111
if that's a word,

4422
01:53:06,111 --> 01:53:07,490
cause like Jj Walker,

4423
01:53:07,491 --> 01:53:08,510
like when he got older,

4424
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:12,140
would hate when people would
like yell out dynamite.

4425
01:53:12,510 --> 01:53:13,790
They would hate it.

4426
01:53:14,390 --> 01:53:14,811
Hate it.

4427
01:53:14,811 --> 01:53:16,370
Cause he wasn't doing that anymore.

4428
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:19,910
Now he's just a standup up trying to make
a living and apparently he didn't like

4429
01:53:19,911 --> 01:53:21,020
that when people,

4430
01:53:21,350 --> 01:53:22,250
that's what they say.

4431
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:23,430
I never did it from,

4432
01:53:23,690 --> 01:53:24,680
maybe the guy loved it.

4433
01:53:24,830 --> 01:53:27,140
Maybe one asshole did it say dynamite.

4434
01:53:27,770 --> 01:53:28,603
Dynamite.

4435
01:53:28,910 --> 01:53:29,301
And he's like,

4436
01:53:29,301 --> 01:53:30,350
I don't like to do it.

4437
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:32,300
But that would be weird though,

4438
01:53:32,310 --> 01:53:35,510
because I mean that's what kind
of got everyone to know who he is.

4439
01:53:35,511 --> 01:53:35,810
That's how,

4440
01:53:35,810 --> 01:53:37,420
but after like 10 years,

4441
01:53:38,180 --> 01:53:39,620
man can stop saying dynamite,

4442
01:53:40,910 --> 01:53:41,930
but an even worse than that.

4443
01:53:41,930 --> 01:53:43,370
Imagine being bobcat where you do the,

4444
01:53:43,580 --> 01:53:46,680
Oh yeah,

4445
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:48,290
I worked with him.

4446
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:49,131
He stopped doing that,

4447
01:53:49,131 --> 01:53:49,730
right?

4448
01:53:49,730 --> 01:53:50,001
Yeah.

4449
01:53:50,001 --> 01:53:51,140
Well he was doing,

4450
01:53:51,660 --> 01:53:51,840
um,

4451
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:52,250
I dunno.

4452
01:53:52,250 --> 01:53:52,550
I Dunno.

4453
01:53:52,550 --> 01:53:54,830
Maybe it's like a goto thing with a joke.

4454
01:53:54,831 --> 01:53:56,630
Like subtly cause he's
still doing stand up.

4455
01:53:56,750 --> 01:53:57,561
Can you still do a stand up?

4456
01:53:57,561 --> 01:53:57,861
Of course.

4457
01:53:57,861 --> 01:53:58,080
Yeah.

4458
01:53:58,080 --> 01:53:58,390
Yeah.

4459
01:53:58,390 --> 01:53:59,000
Cause he didn't,

4460
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:02,150
he stopped for a while and
he was directing Kimmel.

4461
01:54:02,270 --> 01:54:03,470
I mean you drugs Kimmel I think.

4462
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:03,860
Yeah,

4463
01:54:03,860 --> 01:54:05,300
it was directing the man show.

4464
01:54:05,301 --> 01:54:10,301
He directed directed movie does well
and he did the world's worst dad,

4465
01:54:10,911 --> 01:54:12,500
which is a great fucking movie.

4466
01:54:12,501 --> 01:54:13,850
There's a scene that no,

4467
01:54:13,851 --> 01:54:18,851
but I want to [inaudible] movie that he's
got coming up in the American dream or

4468
01:54:21,231 --> 01:54:21,801
something like that.

4469
01:54:21,801 --> 01:54:23,090
I'll find out worlds worse.

4470
01:54:23,091 --> 01:54:23,600
Dad,

4471
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:27,170
Robert will post American
plays a dad whose son,

4472
01:54:28,770 --> 01:54:33,770
guys from auto fixation erotica and he
writes him a suicide note and says he

4473
01:54:34,041 --> 01:54:34,461
killed himself,

4474
01:54:34,461 --> 01:54:35,300
is going to deal with it.

4475
01:54:35,540 --> 01:54:36,950
And because of the suicide note,

4476
01:54:36,951 --> 01:54:39,530
the kids' writings become popular.

4477
01:54:39,650 --> 01:54:40,100
Wow.

4478
01:54:40,100 --> 01:54:42,680
And the dad is doing all the writings
and the data was wanting to be a writer.

4479
01:54:42,681 --> 01:54:44,960
It's a great fucking movie.

4480
01:54:44,961 --> 01:54:46,460
It is a great fucking movie.

4481
01:54:46,490 --> 01:54:48,590
His name is called God bless America.

4482
01:54:48,770 --> 01:54:49,580
And it's,

4483
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:51,710
it's very violent and it just,

4484
01:54:51,711 --> 01:54:52,544
so we played,

4485
01:54:52,750 --> 01:54:53,720

4486
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:55,521

Too late.

4502
01:55:20,450 --> 01:55:24,110
Thanks to everybody who tuned in this
week and thanks to everyone who came out

4503
01:55:24,111 --> 01:55:26,320
to the Ice House comedy club last night.

4504
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:29,270
Fucking trying to show
seriously a really amazing,

4505
01:55:29,271 --> 01:55:29,811
we had a great,

4506
01:55:29,811 --> 01:55:30,391
great time.

4507
01:55:30,391 --> 01:55:32,240
It was so cool to be able to
do that on a Wednesday night.

4508
01:55:33,090 --> 01:55:33,280
Joe,

4509
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:33,640
Joe,

4510
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:35,000
I don't know if we've
talked about this or not.

4511
01:55:35,430 --> 01:55:36,270
I'm thinking about like,

4512
01:55:36,350 --> 01:55:39,920
we should just take over Wednesday
from now on and stiff doing Friday.

4513
01:55:40,070 --> 01:55:42,820
Wednesday's when all the
comics are in town for,

4514
01:55:43,030 --> 01:55:43,980
we can do Fridays too.

4515
01:55:43,981 --> 01:55:44,491
Sometimes.

4516
01:55:44,491 --> 01:55:47,370
I like doing Fridays in the morale would
keep our Fridays open so we'll go up to

4517
01:55:47,371 --> 01:55:47,970
the off guard,

4518
01:55:47,970 --> 01:55:49,380
whatever bitch.

4519
01:55:49,890 --> 01:55:50,610
Um,

4520
01:55:50,610 --> 01:55:53,430
but either way we'll be doing
more shows to the ice house.

4521
01:55:53,431 --> 01:55:54,181
It's a great place.

4522
01:55:54,181 --> 01:55:54,540
And,

4523
01:55:54,540 --> 01:55:56,940
and I got to develop some
new material now before my,

4524
01:55:56,941 --> 01:55:57,090
uh,

4525
01:55:57,090 --> 01:55:57,680
special gifts.

4526
01:55:57,680 --> 01:55:59,910
Are you releasing your special online?

4527
01:55:59,910 --> 01:56:00,240
Yeah,

4528
01:56:00,240 --> 01:56:01,060

4529
01:56:01,060 --> 01:56:01,590
Um,

4530
01:56:01,590 --> 01:56:02,910
they're building a website for it now.

4531
01:56:02,911 --> 01:56:04,050
It's going to take a couple of months.

4532
01:56:04,290 --> 01:56:04,711
So,

4533
01:56:04,711 --> 01:56:04,920
uh,

4534
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:07,140
probably won't be until
like August or September.

4535
01:56:07,170 --> 01:56:08,003
Then I'll release it.

4536
01:56:08,180 --> 01:56:11,310
Let's go on a mushroom trip so we can
even get new material if you can handle

4537
01:56:11,311 --> 01:56:12,144

4538
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:12,440

4540
01:56:13,230 --> 01:56:13,980
Okay.

4541
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:14,251
All right.

4542
01:56:14,251 --> 01:56:14,461
We'll do,

4543
01:56:14,461 --> 01:56:15,450
it just has to be comfortable.

4544
01:56:17,140 --> 01:56:18,310
Like a comfortable situation.

4545
01:56:18,330 --> 01:56:21,940
It can be a hundred degrees in a
hotel room and you and me naked.

4546
01:56:21,970 --> 01:56:22,803
No,

4547
01:56:22,980 --> 01:56:23,520

4548
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:24,150
