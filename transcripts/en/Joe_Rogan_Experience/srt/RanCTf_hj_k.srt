1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,700
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,990
You can go to one 800 flowers.com from
your desktop or mobile device today.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,730
Click on the radio microphone in the
upper right hand corner and enterJ r e Y.

4
00:00:10,731 --> 00:00:11,564
Is that fine?

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,800
Someone else.

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,620
You could also get really
big stuffed animals.

7
00:00:15,621 --> 00:00:16,620
Like look at this like getting ready,

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,411
getting your wife like,

9
00:00:17,411 --> 00:00:17,541
Hey,

10
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:22,541
I just got your dorm is still looks like
a person that's bigger than a person.

11
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:24,973
That's stupid.

12
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,410
Pretty girl that I'm dating that if I
buy a five foot tossed stuffed animal it

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,190
for Valentine's should be pissed off in

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,083
my apartment

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,593
going on here.

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,230
I supposed to hug this when you leave.

17
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,780
What a weird fucking thing.

18
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:45,560
Some girls like it,

19
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,400
they love it.

20
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:47,234
Are you kidding me?

21
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,260
That's a smooth move.

22
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:52,040
You bring over a four foot teddy
bear that shits because it's unusual.

23
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:52,910
It's like a trick.

24
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:53,720
You know?

25
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,081
It's like,

26
00:00:54,081 --> 00:00:55,550
it's really not like,

27
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:59,780
you know like if you had to like figure
out like what's the best size baseball

28
00:00:59,781 --> 00:01:00,710
bat to play baseball.

29
00:01:00,711 --> 00:01:01,281
Everybody's like,

30
00:01:01,281 --> 00:01:03,560
well there'd be no more
limitations on baseball bats.

31
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:03,850
Well,

32
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,150
I'm going to pick up a fucking tree,

33
00:01:05,151 --> 00:01:05,984
bro.

34
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,790
I'm going to fucking swing the tree,

35
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,160
but the tree is not the right size.

36
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,850
It's probably not one of those mini
baseball bats they give out at the stadium

37
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:14,684
and it's not a tree.

38
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,330
Somewhere in there is the right size.

39
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,213
If,

40
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,410
and I think that you would
find that out about bears too,

41
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,730
you'd get their big bear go,

42
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,020
listen,

43
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,580
this motherfucker's pissing me off.

44
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,680
This things everywhere.

45
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,070
I tripped over it in the middle of
the night when I'm going to pee.

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,800
This fucking bear is ridiculous.

47
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:33,810
I am the ultimate American consumers.

48
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,660
I have a fucking 80 foot tall bear,

49
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:36,441
handsome.

50
00:01:36,441 --> 00:01:37,274
Henry's isn't name.

51
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,123
He's cute though,

52
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,410
but he's cool to cuddle with too.

53
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:39,741
Yeah.

54
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:41,750
Maybe it's a good pillow bed pillow thing.

55
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:42,584
When you're gone,

56
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,290
you're never home and
she could just spin it.

57
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,221
That could,

58
00:01:46,221 --> 00:01:46,680
yeah.

59
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,210
They actually do sell things
for lonely bachelor's in Japan.

60
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:50,841
It's like a,

61
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:51,740
it was like a pillow,

62
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,583
like an arm.

63
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,860
I like reaches over it
like it's holding onto.

64
00:01:54,861 --> 00:01:56,120
It's a very strange stuff.

65
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,830
I wonder if you could wash this.

66
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,823
Yeah.

67
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,903
Just get,

68
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,073
yeah,

69
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,050
don't,

70
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,490
don't get a pillow with
a fucking arm around it.

71
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:05,300
That's creepy.

72
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,440
If you want to sleep with a teddy bear,

73
00:02:06,441 --> 00:02:08,780
you can pretend a teddy bears
its own individual thing.

74
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,450
Right?

75
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,680
Can you just with some weird fake arm,

76
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,490
and this is washable so you can
hump it all you want and wash it.

77
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,330
I'll fuck you going to wash them.

78
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,400
You're going to go

79
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,570
places where they clean sales.

80
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,083
Wait,

81
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,620
who are you going to bring
that fucking 20 foot tall bear?

82
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:30,560
It's washable.

83
00:02:30,561 --> 00:02:33,760
Is fucking washing machine
is going to fit that bear?

84
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,440
Is there a human alive?

85
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,280
It's just a hose.

86
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,113
Put it in the driveway.

87
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:38,001
Yeah,

88
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:40,390
you got a hose that thing
down then it smells like mold.

89
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,930
Can't hose that down.

90
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:43,900
Maybe it's waterproof.

91
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:44,580
Maybe they're slick.

92
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,411
And since you're fixed,

93
00:02:45,411 --> 00:02:46,420
smile this quicker.

94
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:47,320
No,

95
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,150
it's not fake.

96
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,320
She loves that bed.

97
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:49,631
Dude.

98
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:50,530
Don't be a dick.

99
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,470
I'm four feet tall.

100
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:54,850
What do you talk?

101
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,530
Why does it say I'm four feet tall?

102
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,990
Am I supposed to think that
the bears fucking talking to?

103
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,910
How about it's four feet tall?

104
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,160
I'm four feet tall.

105
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:03,450
The fight.

106
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,930
You're not fucking real man,

107
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,360
right?

108
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,980
That who's writing this shit for you?

109
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,380
Who's your ghost writer?

110
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:12,520
Bitch is another one.

111
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,440
Um,

112
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:14,741
anyway,

113
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:15,574
they're adorable.

114
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,930
One 800 flowers.com.

115
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:26,850
Yeah.
