1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,470
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,471 --> 00:00:03,840
one of this Skype things
that this Peter Popoff does,

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,930
he also sends you a barley cake
from the Bible where it's like,

4
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:10,980
kind of like that little bread you eat.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:11,990
And he goes,

6
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,300
ah.

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,680
He goes in this commercial,

8
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:18,390
he goes and we make it with the exact
ingredients that they say in the Bible and

9
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:18,571
Blah,

10
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:19,200
blah blah.

11
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,950
Well then if you look up Zeke
eel four 12 in the Bible,

12
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,580
it says,

13
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,440
and you should eat it as barley cakes
and bake it using fuel of human waste,

14
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:28,890
human way.

15
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:29,540
So,

16
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,940
so in any way,

17
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,920
you want to bet [inaudible] for 12

18
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:35,853
okay,

19
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,250
Becky with Dung that cometh
out of man in their sight.

20
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh,

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,440
so he's saying

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,480
are cooked with shit.

23
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:48,663
Oh my God,

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,290
thou shalt bake it with Dung and
that cometh out of man in their sight

25
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,930
in the,

26
00:00:56,931 --> 00:01:01,210
to study the Bible and Cook
Cookie bread with Shit.

27
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,080
Have you ever tried my purple barley cake?

28
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:06,340
You fucking imagine how dumb people are.

29
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,870
That really hurts my brain.

30
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,003
Do you know what Zeke?

31
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:09,251
Zeke,

32
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:12,100
you'll might've been a tripper cause
the Zico was also where the first

33
00:01:12,101 --> 00:01:13,930
depictions of Ufos came from.

34
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:14,411
Here,

35
00:01:14,411 --> 00:01:15,244
let me pull that up.

36
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,080
How do you not read that
and just start laughing?

37
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,850
You told me to cook shit cakes.

38
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,130
The Bible says Cook Shit cakes.

39
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,110
That's just one more
dumb thing in the Bible.

40
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:23,671
God down.

41
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:24,880
I was so tired of people pretending.

42
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:25,750
That book's awesome.

43
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,690
I'm so tired.

44
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,850
You stop that shit stupid.

45
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,511
Okay,

46
00:01:31,511 --> 00:01:31,780
here.

47
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,320
Here's a,

48
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:32,951
here's a quote.

49
00:01:32,951 --> 00:01:34,300
And I looked and behold,

50
00:01:34,301 --> 00:01:36,010
a whirlwind came out of the north,

51
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,040
a great cloud and a fire enfolding itself
in brightness was about it and out of

52
00:01:43,091 --> 00:01:48,091
the midst thereof as the color of
amber out of the midst of the fire.

53
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:49,790
Okay.

54
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,623
How's audio file?

55
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,113
Hmm?

56
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,810
Somebody putting two points
together that don't go together

57
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:57,291
well,

58
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:58,090
wait a minute,

59
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:58,860
hold on.

60
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,630
Listen to this.

61
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,081
Also.

62
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:04,580
Out of the midst thereof came the likeness
of four living creatures and this was

63
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:05,414
their appearance.

64
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,360
They had the likeness of a man woe.

65
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:09,651
After in,

66
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:11,540
everyone had four faces in.

67
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:16,520
Every one had four wings and their feet
were straight and the sole of their feet

68
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,700
was like the soul of a calf's foot and
they sparkled like the color of burnished

69
00:02:22,131 --> 00:02:22,964
brass.

70
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,560
What a trippy book.

71
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:25,400
People like,

72
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:25,791
oh my God,

73
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:26,624
it's so real.

74
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,740
I hear God's words when you're saying
each things God's speaking to me through

75
00:02:30,741 --> 00:02:31,131
your words,

76
00:02:31,131 --> 00:02:31,970
please read on.

77
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,240
And they had the hands of man under
their wings on their four sides and they

78
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:37,940
had,

79
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,470
and they four had their
faces and their ways.

80
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,360
Somebody might have just made all this
up and me like an asshole as reading

81
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:48,650
these fake Bible quotes shitting
all over the Bible and the aliens.

82
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,430
But guess what?

83
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,150
I don't care.

84
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,421
I'm not,

85
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:51,620
I'm not reading any further.

86
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,130
It's,

87
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,750
it seems like if this is,

88
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,400
if this really is the gills,

89
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,750
it says it is.

90
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,650
God dammit.

91
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,640
They could saw nuttiness.

92
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,670
They walked up with their
four faces and they said,

93
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:02,890
why are you guys cooking things in Shit?

94
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,840
And the living creatures ran in,

95
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:07,540
returned as the appearance
of a flash of lightening.

96
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,550
Now as I behold the living creatures,

97
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:14,380
behold one wheel upon the earth by the
living creatures with his four faces.

98
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,150
These guys were tripping
hard eating shit cake.

99
00:03:17,151 --> 00:03:17,860
So yeah,

100
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,700
losing their mind.

101
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,800
But you are afraid of aliens though,

102
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:21,470
right?

103
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:21,801
Yeah,

104
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:22,634
my friend.

105
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,500
Does it show a path
mapped out in your house?

106
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,450
How to get out of the aliens show up?

107
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,780
No,

108
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,873
that's the rumor.

109
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,740
I heard you have a plan because I
know you like to use game plans,

110
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,663
so I figured,

111
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,080
I know,

112
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,230
I know cat ready and I know
Jujitsu so the and show up.

113
00:03:42,231 --> 00:03:45,930
I put a triangle choke on him
and I also have a cat that ammo.

114
00:03:45,931 --> 00:03:47,120
So I kept that in a Japanese.

115
00:03:47,121 --> 00:03:47,571
Got that now.

116
00:03:47,571 --> 00:03:49,400
So if they come I can slice them apart.

117
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:49,990
Wow.

118
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,410
Do you keep a sword in your house?

119
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,390
That's pretty gangster.

120
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,440
It's a collection.

121
00:03:54,441 --> 00:03:55,191
You know it's funny.

122
00:03:55,191 --> 00:03:57,920
It's as to to bring
any crazy bitches home.

123
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:58,881
I man,

124
00:03:58,881 --> 00:04:00,710
it's a sword and crazy bitches.

125
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,863
I have this

126
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,020
side of my bed that I always forget is
there and I was like almost cut my finger

127
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:05,771
off all the time.

128
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:06,330
At the middle.

129
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,330
You should put that in the
garage song fuck is wrong.

130
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,970
Cause like big sword slash
meat cleaver that it's just

131
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,101
so,

132
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:18,640
do you really have a fear of aliens
or is this just a bullshit rumor?

133
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,140
Cause it,

134
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,540
what didn't you do a countdown show and
you did a whole thing talking about how

135
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,550
you being scared of
being abducted by aliens.

136
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:25,500
Yeah,

137
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,200
I'm scared.

138
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,370
I'm scared of a lot of things,

139
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:28,204
you know?

140
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,210
I'll get,

141
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,110
I'll get into it.

142
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,150
I got,

143
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,410
I kept talking about it right now,

144
00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:35,530
right?

145
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:35,890
Yeah,

146
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:36,890
I'm talking about it right now.

147
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,600
How's that one day elegant to come
out and make a big thing about it,

148
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:41,130
but not all right.

149
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:41,880
I believe had been,

150
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,211
hold on,

151
00:04:42,211 --> 00:04:42,970
hold on.

152
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:43,510
Yeah.

153
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,240
Have you had an experience with aliens?

154
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:47,730
No.

155
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:47,920
No,

156
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,101
no,

157
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:48,221
no,

158
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:48,760
no.

159
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,593
I don't believe you.

160
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,390
I don't believe you.

161
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:51,660
Okay.

162
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,190
No,

163
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:52,820
I don't know.

164
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,380
You don't know.

165
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,820
You might have had an experience with it.

166
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,800
I and my manager got to have
a heart attack right now.

167
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,780
I would never do or
lead you down any path.

168
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:02,860
It's bad for your career.

169
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:05,770
Just as you said that
it's good to be afraid.

170
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,630
It's also good to be
honest about everything.

171
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:08,111
Even shit.

172
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:08,950
That sounds crazy.

173
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,060
I love it.

174
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,870
That's the thing.

175
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,860
I'm on this and like,

176
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:12,810
look,

177
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,560
I'm on s I'm afraid,

178
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,990
but I don't have to tell everything on,

179
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,970
on the lake.

180
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,610
It's true.

181
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,443
You don't,

182
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,890
but you know,

183
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,260
in an alien because you're a smart guy.

184
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:23,741
Let me tell you,

185
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:24,820
you're a very smart guy.

186
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:25,091
You know,

187
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:25,990
you know how to dig,

188
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,930
dig into people's mind.

189
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,180
And as Martin,

190
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,801
I like you.

191
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:30,161
I lie.

192
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:33,850
I hate that about you because
he put me on the spot right now.

193
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:35,200
But he's a very smart guy.

194
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,860
But now I know I gotta
I gotta go too deep.

195
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,560
Listen,

196
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,220
if I was on an alien spacecraft
and I had sex with an alien,

197
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:43,450
like I'm assuming you did,

198
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,870
I feel like I would just
come out and talk about it.

199
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,310
I don't know why he would hold that back.

200
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,111
Nah,

201
00:05:49,111 --> 00:05:49,240
man.

202
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,730
I mean,

203
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,563
ah,

204
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,551
something happened,

205
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,384
George.

206
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,313
I don't know.

207
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,100
It's either,

208
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,960
it's either I'm crazy or,

209
00:05:55,961 --> 00:05:56,680
or,

210
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,020
or,

211
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,380
uh,

212
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,430
maybe it really happened,

213
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:58,900
but I,

214
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,350
I hope that I'm crazy.

215
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,090
I don't think you're crazy.

216
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,050
I hope I am.

217
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:05,180
It could be pre crazy
cause he know some people,

218
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,160
some great mine and you know they had,

219
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:10,020
they had been hallucinating
stuff or some people are are,

220
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,500
I'll just say Mandy equity oppressive.

221
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,321
Some people are,

222
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:13,340
are uh,

223
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:13,980
OCD.

224
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,811
Some people are dead,

225
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:16,550
some people are dead
and they're still there.

226
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,610
They've been able to actually
have great stuff on their life.

227
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,230
And also maybe I'm crazy when I was,

228
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:22,064
I don't know,

229
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,140
I open well

230
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,470
water in New York,

231
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,670
there's no good water.

232
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:26,960
You can't drink any of that.

233
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:28,550
You can't grow fish in any of that.

234
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,170
All that water's polluted with like,

235
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:30,441
yeah,

236
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:31,040
you know,

237
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,710
it's the Hudson the way
it is just the way it is.

238
00:06:34,711 --> 00:06:36,200
It's fucking animals.

239
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,320
Just throwing glass and shit and Piss
and tampons and rubbers and fontes body

240
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,370
fuck fucking dead people from New York,

241
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,240
new the Jersey Cylon on Sundays.

242
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:51,230
It's like a big day for him.

243
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,250
Like we're going to Jersey on fucking
Sunday and they go over it and they fish.

244
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,121
They catch eel,

245
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:56,930
no gorilla.

246
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:57,980
Oh what the fuck?

247
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:58,720
It's just an ideal.

248
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,553
Got Meat on it.

249
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,370
Just might reveal from the fucking hood.

250
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,151
That's why I used to get,

251
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:03,440
I'm not cancer.

252
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,400
They can suck my dick.

253
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,780
I need to heal from the phone.

254
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,990
I remember we were in Jersey one time
and me and Joe on a bus and it's a side,

255
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:12,890
a UFC event,

256
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,980
and I showed him this pond and I said,

257
00:07:15,981 --> 00:07:16,814
look at cancer.

258
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,380
It was late cancer.

259
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:21,920
It was cancer at this pond had
hadn't move that no movement.

260
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,770
It had like a layer of this green algae,

261
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:25,850
which really wasn't green.

262
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:28,390
That's just cancer that you know they,

263
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,720
you know New Jersey,

264
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:34,010
they've been dumping shit since
the 70s since the sixties bro.

265
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,630
That that's never going to be,

266
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,421
that's what's,

267
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:37,070
what's a,

268
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,230
what's that word of Reco?

269
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,230
RECO bubble.

270
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:39,980
Reconcilable.

271
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,131
No,

272
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:40,670
the other word,

273
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,820
when you can't reverse it,

274
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:47,480
you can never ever a
reverse goes that soil and

275
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,270
that soil in New Jersey.

276
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,680
I remember when that,

277
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,880
when they built the metal lands,

278
00:07:55,881 --> 00:07:57,020
I remember how many animals,

279
00:07:57,021 --> 00:08:00,680
all of a sudden I had in my living
room because they tore all that down,

280
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:01,670
that wildlife.

281
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,990
And next thing I was seeing,

282
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,150
I remember one night seen a possum,

283
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:10,151
the size of a small people fucking
treat jumped on a fucking tree.

284
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,143
You saw me,

285
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,430
he walked like a fucking ate those things.

286
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,440
When you call the police in Jersey,

287
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:19,430
I've got a possum here.

288
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,750
They shoot the fucking thing.

289
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,400
They shoot the fucking thing.

290
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:23,970
Oh shoot.

291
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,030
Snakes in the lottery.

292
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,620
They shoot the fucking
possible cause they play dead.

293
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,790
And then when the cops leave,

294
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,890
they fucking get up and they brushed as
you could run over a fucking car with

295
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,320
bicycles and throw names out of

296
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,890
behavioral trait.

297
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,090
They play day fucking ways.

298
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,510
Some that's where playing possum.

299
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:43,821
Oh,

300
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:47,540
I seen a fucking possum that looked at
me one night at like four in the morning.

301
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,681
I looked at him,

302
00:08:48,681 --> 00:08:49,131
I was like,

303
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:50,480
what the fuck?

304
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,220
And he jumped on a tree

305
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,760
and I was like,

306
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:01,560
this is fucking mind boggling.

307
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,410
Okay.
