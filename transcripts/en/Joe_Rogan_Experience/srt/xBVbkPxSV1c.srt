1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,740
Right,
we're going to go live in five,

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:02,670
four,
three,

3
00:00:02,671 --> 00:00:07,671
two.
So tell me about your feminist.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:13,860
I got it here.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,230
Um,
girl logic.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,890
It was the difference between,
oh,

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,340
the genius and the absurdity.
What's the difference between girl logic

8
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:22,660
and boy logic or do you know?
Because I don't know,

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,250
I can't tell you exactly the way men 
think because I think if I did that it'd

10
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:31,251
be like slow your roll.
The book is about me sort of noticing 

11
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:35,070
that women are always called crazy 
psycho psychopaths psycho bitch,

12
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,390
you know,
like oh she's insane.

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,420
We always write off women as crazy and 
women are expected to be so many things 

14
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:46,101
to so many people at once and if these 
expectations that sort of we have to 

15
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:51,090
take into account all of this and we try
to be so many things at once and we have

16
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:54,030
to take in so much stimuli to process 
all this.

17
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:59,031
So our logic is sort of,
it's sort of this like circumlocutions 

18
00:00:59,031 --> 00:01:00,250
way of thinking that seems insane.
Slow that word down.

19
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,450
What was that circle like?
You know,

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,070
like going around in circles.
I was at work was say it again,

21
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:08,670
circle the computer,
this big bird or whatever like that.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,590
I've never heard that before.
So it's like,

23
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:13,260
um,
I'd never heard of the mad cow thing.

24
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:14,490
You were telling me that earlier and I 
was like,

25
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,270
oh my God,
are we on?

26
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,640
I was,
as you were talking about,

27
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,060
I was like,
please don't make me look stupid.

28
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:20,310
I don't know about El Kevin Crazy 
brains,

29
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,540
but I just the base,
the boiler plate example is,

30
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,590
you know,
you say to a girl what do you want to 

31
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,590
eat?
Right.

32
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,590
And that's always an argument.
It's like this common trope,

33
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,630
like my wife couldn't ever figure it 
out,

34
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,170
but it has less to do with women wanting
to be difficult and more pressure on 

35
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,770
just that one decision.
If I say pizza,

36
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,500
am I doing a diet?
Do I have to be in a bathing suit later?

37
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:45,501
Did I go to the gym already?
Am I expected to be thin in this 

38
00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:45,501
society?
And we take all of this into account for

39
00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:50,451
every micro decision.
And it's all about processing how we 

40
00:01:50,451 --> 00:01:53,961
don't let everyone,
including ourselves down and all the 

41
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:53,961
thought that goes into it.

42
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:55,540
Well No,
this is used specifically,

43
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,990
like obviously you're not speaking for 
all women,

44
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,120
but I actually got the title,
I got the rights to it,

45
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:05,530
I pulled 10 women.
They were like,

46
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,560
it's cool.
So I need is honoring the fact that we 

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,381
get painted with these broad brush 
strokes and there's so many and there's 

48
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:17,251
just so much that goes into the littlest
things because we have to take into 

49
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:18,700
account how other people feel.
So it's easy to say,

50
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:19,960
oh,
just be yourself,

51
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:25,170
but when you're a woman,
other people's perceptions of you can 

52
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:25,990
have detrimental effects on your future,
on your safety,

53
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,350
on your health.
She seemed slutty so she deserved it.

54
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:31,540
She seems like a bitch.
I don't want to give her a chance,

55
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:34,300
you know?
So our perception versus the way that we

56
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:34,670
are,
we're,

57
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:38,020
we're constantly wrestling with these 
two sort of realities.

58
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,380
Yeah.
Yeah.

59
00:02:41,381 --> 00:02:46,381
I,
I've often wondered like if you could 

60
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:50,180
like,
I believe that one day they're going to 

61
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:50,180
be able to,
you know,

62
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:50,710
today we have transgender people,
right?

63
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:54,700
We have people who decide to have 
operations decided to take hormones,

64
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,910
but I think one day they're going to be 
able to literally a person into a woman 

65
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,530
with a shot.
Yeah.

66
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:04,240
Well,
not with some sort of treatment.

67
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,560
I just feel like it sounds crazy to say 
today people say,

68
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:09,970
no,
you can't change your chromosomes.

69
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:12,340
Well today you can't change your 
chromosomes,

70
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:15,490
but 200 years ago the idea of sending a 
video to someone in Australia,

71
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:16,750
it'd be ridiculous.
Right?

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,050
So like what we've been able to do just 
over a short period of time,

73
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:25,051
relatively is pretty staggering.
And if you look at like what they're 

74
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:26,170
doing with Crispr,
do you know what Crispr is?

75
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,230
It's gene editing tools that they keep 
evolving there.

76
00:03:30,231 --> 00:03:35,231
They've gotten them to the point where 
they're starting to work on human 

77
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:35,990
embryos,
non-viable human embryos in there.

78
00:03:35,991 --> 00:03:38,540
They're changing the expression of 
certain genes has changed.

79
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,570
Genes got stopping genes for certain 
diseases and there's.

80
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,620
Yeah,
I don't like this chair.

81
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,250
I knew it was expensive.
It can drop if you want to make it 

82
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:50,590
lower.
Close to my heart.

83
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,360
Okay.
Hm.

84
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,920
Interesting.
Um,

85
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,100
but the idea is that they're going to be
able to like make designer people.

86
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,230
Sure.
Right.

87
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,280
So this,
this is less,

88
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,240
this is,
you know,

89
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:05,410
you're a woman obviously with by 
genetics and your Genitalia,

90
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:10,411
but this book is all about the 
experiences and this is more societal 

91
00:04:10,411 --> 00:04:11,260
based.
This is less about what you're born as.

92
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,830
That was,
that's what I was going to say.

93
00:04:12,831 --> 00:04:14,990
I was like I was saying if,
if you could like I,

94
00:04:14,991 --> 00:04:17,570
I've wondered if that was a possibility 
they could reverse it.

95
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,000
What I want to be a woman for like a 
week.

96
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,170
Yeah,
for a week,

97
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,360
but let me see it just to see,
just to play with them.

98
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,470
Just stick stuff up there.
But I think that like we don't,

99
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,040
we don't know about the,
the closest you come to understanding a 

100
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,870
man or a woman if you're a man or if 
you're the opposite.

101
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:40,860
Sex I think is living with one or having
one or having one.

102
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,920
Yeah,
that's a big one for me was having 

103
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,620
daughters and just seeing how they just 
interact.

104
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,650
Sure.
From the time they're one until you 

105
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:51,650
know,
they're older.

106
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:51,650
It's some of its biology.
Yeah.

107
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,350
You know,
this whole,

108
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,060
you know,
when you,

109
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,780
and I've talked about or know of someone
else,

110
00:04:54,781 --> 00:04:58,610
but still the sort of um,
what women excluding other women.

111
00:04:58,611 --> 00:05:01,140
So this goes back to when we were 
hunters and gatherers.

112
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:06,290
If you didn't want someone to live,
you'd turn your back on them and you 

113
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,200
wouldn't share information and then you 
and your offspring will die.

114
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,570
Right?
So some you see this,

115
00:05:09,571 --> 00:05:14,571
a little girls like they're mean,
they're mean to each other and as you 

116
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:14,571
get older,
you know,

117
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:17,250
you're taking in all of this stimuli 
from society,

118
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:21,570
all the messages and we have to process 
these things and then eventually you get

119
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,170
old enough,
you're like,

120
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:23,580
fuck it,
I'm going to do it my own way.

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But there's still expectations place.
And a lot of them are conflicting like 

122
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,680
polar opposites.
Like you have to be sexy but also 

123
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:33,680
demure,
outgoing,

124
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,300
but don't be too pushy and too pushy or 
outgoing.

125
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,540
They're relative depending on who's in 
your path,

126
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,360
so,
and women have to take these things into

127
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:45,090
account because we got to do everything 
second.

128
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,410
We didn't create professional sports or 
corporations.

129
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,330
We're late to the game for everything.
So it's a man's world and you do have to

130
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,880
take into account those rules and it 
sucks,

131
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:02,350
but these are all the things that we 
have to factor in when we're making 

132
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:02,350
decisions.

133
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,930
Then there's always going to be a 
certain amount of resentment if someone 

134
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,100
tries to do it a woman's way rather than
a man's what?

135
00:06:06,101 --> 00:06:08,310
You need a tissue?
Never going to stop running.

136
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:08,850
But uh,
you,

137
00:06:08,851 --> 00:06:09,930
uh,
you have allergies.

138
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,120
I don't know.
My nose just always runs a little bit 

139
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,120
too much.
I hate.

140
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,770
I hate when people do so much.
He knows it's so little.

141
00:06:16,771 --> 00:06:19,920
I don't know how you get coke up there.
You have coke rocks that we get stuck in

142
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,450
your nose holes.
They're still stuck up there.

143
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:27,810
Keep it like I've wondered like I don't 
work right.

144
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:34,310
I don't have a job,
a real job and I haven't had one in a 

145
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:34,310
long,
long time.

146
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,820
So the idea of like having a boss is 
alien to me and had a female boss is 

147
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,600
even more annoying to me.
Sure.

148
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,640
So I was,
I'm talking to someone who has a woman 

149
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:43,640
boss and um,
we,

150
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,010
we were saying that there's an 
interesting thing that happens where a 

151
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,830
woman can do the exact same thing and 
she's a bitch.

152
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,830
Whereas if the guy does it,
he's stern,

153
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,740
he's a hard ass or no,

154
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,890
it's a,
it's all this,

155
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,880
it's a,
you know,

156
00:06:56,881 --> 00:07:01,881
as women age,
their gross and men are austere or the 

157
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:01,881
regal intersects,
you know.

158
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:04,680
And those are kind of basic examples,
you know.

159
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,720
Um,
and I think we're moving away from that.

160
00:07:06,721 --> 00:07:11,721
It's more nuanced things I like,
you really can't identify with workplace

161
00:07:12,241 --> 00:07:14,630
issues.
I talked to some friends of mine,

162
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,640
they're like,
I hate that I have to dumb things down 

163
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,000
or people express and in my domain,
like I worked very hard to be the one in

164
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:24,990
charge and men don't speak to me that 
way because they're opening for me.

165
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,470
Right,
right,

166
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:26,590
right.
There's just,

167
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:31,700
I don't have that hierarchy.
So they're the manager of the club or 

168
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,340
you got to pay me anyway.
So,

169
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,640
um,
but it doesn't mean that I don't have a 

170
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,741
sort of sympathy for that and that I 
don't understand what it feels like to 

171
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:41,040
be discounted.
So as long as time you had a job job,

172
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,270
job,
job,

173
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,590
job,
job was probably 2004,

174
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,320
five,
six relatively recently,

175
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,960
12 years,
15 years ago.

176
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,810
And I wasn't mentally present that much 
for it.

177
00:07:54,811 --> 00:07:56,280
It was kind of relaxed,
you know,

178
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:01,670
but,
and it wasn't like I wasn't trying to 

179
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:01,670
get ahead at that job.

180
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,890
It was 2006.
So 11 years ago.

181
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,260
That's like a base of maybe seven years 
ago,

182
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,390
maybe,
maybe 2007.

183
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,760
So 10 years ago,
11 or whatever it is that you're like a 

184
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:13,760
different human.
Right.

185
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,700
You're so like,
do you remember it very well?

186
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:15,660
Like what was the job?

187
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I was the last job I had,
I was an assistant in the marketing 

188
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,670
department of a large company that dealt
with like Black Jack.

189
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,800
It was like a black Jack.
It was like a new kind of interesting 

190
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,830
and so.
But this Nice Jewish guy hired me and I 

191
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,680
was just there to answer the phone if 
anyone ever called,

192
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,950
make some press kits like it was monkey 
work and you were obviously doing 

193
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,470
standup.
I was doing standup at night and I would

194
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,560
spend the days sort of like soliciting 
people if I could get a spot on their 

195
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:43,870
show,
making flyers,

196
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:48,871
like I just use it as my own office and 
I didn't have also the environment like 

197
00:08:48,871 --> 00:08:50,320
I could wear pajamas to work.
Like no one ever came to.

198
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,680
Our office was barely,
barely a regular job.

199
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,550
Yeah,
there's definitely.

200
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:56,320
I wasn't like in the workforce now 
happening

201
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,760
regular jobs.
There's obviously a huge problem with 

202
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,640
the dynamic that men and women have in 
regular jobs,

203
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:05,760
but there's a problem with men and men 
in regular jobs like pee.

204
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,820
I don't think that it's normal for 
people to be working on top of each 

205
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,420
other doing something they don't want to
do for long stretches of time.

206
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:15,150
I think it's very difficult to be 
yourself.

207
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:20,180
You have all these restrictions on your 
language and the way you're allowed to 

208
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,800
communicate with each other and then 
you're obviously doing something all day

209
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:24,270
that you would rather not be doing.

210
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,660
So I have two thoughts on that.
One.

211
00:09:26,661 --> 00:09:31,661
It's interesting because we have this 
corporate structure which is really 

212
00:09:31,661 --> 00:09:34,490
designed to minimize suing and to 
minimize issues,

213
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,460
but since humans aren't meant to be put 
in these boxes,

214
00:09:37,461 --> 00:09:40,250
I think it perhaps creates more problems
were too confined,

215
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,760
but it's interesting.
I opened a lot of my snaps on snapchat 

216
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:45,920
and you'll always get ones that are 
like,

217
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:51,010
ugh,
for 49 can for the state of database 

218
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:51,010
over hate work,
don't want to go into work.

219
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,950
It's all about hating your job,
which I don't understand because I.

220
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,850
I love my job and I worked very hard to 
have a job that I enjoy,

221
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,910
but I don't know if everybody I talk in 
my book about,

222
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,130
you know,
your passion and finding it and whenever

223
00:10:01,131 --> 00:10:04,190
you can find it.
Not everybody's meant for greatness.

224
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:09,610
Not everybody's meant to be happy and 
some people are dumb and I know this 

225
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,240
sounds terrible.
Like I'm designing some master plan,

226
00:10:11,241 --> 00:10:14,510
but some people need to just go and do 
the shitty job.

227
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:19,240
You're not contributing.
Not everybody is meant like this is like

228
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:24,250
some Hitler Eugenic Shit.
Make my fucking phone be quiet because 

229
00:10:24,681 --> 00:10:26,780
if you think about the majority of 
people you talked to,

230
00:10:26,781 --> 00:10:30,860
like some people are not bright and no,
you don't have the mental wherewithal to

231
00:10:30,861 --> 00:10:32,270
carve out your own happiness.
So

232
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,500
that's a genetic thing.
I'd always had an environmental thing.

233
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,040
I think it's a religious thing.
No,

234
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,370
I don't know.
I don't know.

235
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,570
It just takes all kinds.
Right?

236
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,410
It does take all,

237
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:45,890
but I will always wonder like is it what
they've experienced in their life?

238
00:10:45,891 --> 00:10:48,620
Is it the family environment that they 
grew up in?

239
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,050
Is it just straight raw genetics?

240
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:56,300
Some people are just dumb.
I don't know if it's nature versus 

241
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:56,300
nurture.
Fix that.

242
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:56,820
Well,
I will tell you this.

243
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:02,260
I do think it's more nurture than 
anything because I go and I read to kids

244
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,050
at at this elementary school and they're
all Latino.

245
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,260
They all speak Spanish.
There's not a blonde kid in the group 

246
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:12,260
and I think it's very easy to write off 
minorities,

247
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:17,211
you know,
they don't speak English as their 

248
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:18,441
parents don't speak English,
whatever and the kids are so fucking 

249
00:11:18,441 --> 00:11:21,801
smart and like they're like four years 
old and they're reading and they're 

250
00:11:21,801 --> 00:11:25,581
guessing things and they speak two 
languages and you get chills because 

251
00:11:25,581 --> 00:11:26,220
you're like,
I don't know if you're going to have the

252
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:31,221
opportunities I had and that kills me 
because I can see that you're smart and 

253
00:11:31,221 --> 00:11:35,970
you want to like take one which is 
illegal and like put them in a good 

254
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,201
school.
But I mean that's just the way of the 

255
00:11:39,201 --> 00:11:39,201
world as opposed

256
00:11:39,201 --> 00:11:43,960
diet.
I think diet is a huge part of it is a 

257
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,250
huge part in the way a child's mind and 
body develop.

258
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,900
I was,
I read this article,

259
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:53,230
I want to say it was in the Atlantic,
but it was about sort of the language 

260
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,160
surrounding and running clean

261
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,160
eating and how that term shames people 
who are poor because you're suggesting 

262
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:02,680
that their food is dirty,
which it is to an extent,

263
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,110
but it how clean eating is just for rich
people.

264
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,870
That's a silly way of describing it.
No,

265
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,930
it's not.
That's not what it means.

266
00:12:08,931 --> 00:12:11,770
It means there's a lack of preservatives
and bullshit,

267
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:16,771
but that's all in and twinkies are 
affordable and they're filled with 

268
00:12:16,771 --> 00:12:16,771
garbage.
Yeah,

269
00:12:16,771 --> 00:12:20,770
but let us is affordable too.
I mean it's not expensive to eat queen.

270
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,960
No.
In terms of.

271
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,280
I mean it's expensive.
You want to go to whole foods,

272
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:27,130
but you have to define.
I mean clean to everyone is different.

273
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:32,230
Right.
It's a weird term and is just one 

274
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,230
interesting.
It was just one take on it.

275
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,270
I don't know if I totally agree with it,
but like I did the.

276
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,110
I started doing the Ketogenic Diet and 
my father isn't doing it,

277
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:40,390
but he takes these exogenous Kita Jens,
I guess,

278
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:41,680
and he's like,
my mind is sharp.

279
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,460
I'm focused and I think there was a bit 
of a power of suggestion,

280
00:12:45,461 --> 00:12:50,461
but I definitely don't have an energy 
dip and I feel like my body's burning 

281
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:52,030
clean fields.
Very legit.

282
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,010
I mean there's.
There's a lot of science behind it.

283
00:12:54,011 --> 00:12:59,011
There's a podcast that I did pretty 
recently with a guy named Dom 

284
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:02,910
D'agostino,
who's a scientist and does a lot of 

285
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,060
clinical research on kidogenic diet and 
he.

286
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,460
He can give you like real raw hard data,
but there's A.

287
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:10,000
There's a big issue with your body 
burning off carbohydrates,

288
00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:14,260
especially in particularly refined 
carbohydrates and then spikes of insulin

289
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:19,261
and then the dips.
You just feel terrible and you need a 

290
00:13:19,261 --> 00:13:22,111
nap in the middle of the day.
I've been operating that way for so 

291
00:13:22,111 --> 00:13:25,321
long.
I'm not saying I'm enlightened now and 

292
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:25,321
this will be it forever,
but I was like,

293
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:25,321
yeah,
you just take a nap.

294
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:25,990
President takes a nap.
People,

295
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:31,020
most of Europe takes an APP.
You take a nap and I started doing this 

296
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,441
and I was just on this press tour and I 
went into it and this is sometimes just 

297
00:13:34,441 --> 00:13:36,640
knowing that it changes possible is 
almost more important than the outcome.

298
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,210
I went onto this thing in New York and 
every time you do press it's like you're

299
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:41,020
up at 6:00
AM,

300
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:44,380
you're done at 7:00
PM and it's a gauntlet and I always feel

301
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,350
disgusting and tired and bloated and 
this time I was like,

302
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:52,351
I'm just going to.
I'm going to do the ketogenic diet 

303
00:13:52,351 --> 00:13:52,351
throughout,
and I never needed a nap.

304
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,480
I didn't feel like I outgrew my clothes.
Like I felt like a human and I felt 

305
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,020
pretty,
which is such a weird thing,

306
00:13:59,021 --> 00:14:04,021
but like there's nothing worse than 
being bloated as a girl and it's got to 

307
00:14:04,021 --> 00:14:07,321
be the Diet because you're burning clean
fuel and there's no dips and if you 

308
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:07,540
think about every time you reach for a 
snack,

309
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,610
which is so easy or a piece of candy and
a Green Room,

310
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
you're doing that to your body that the 
spikes and that's exhausting and that's 

311
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,850
why you're napping at 4:00
everyday.

312
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:16,960
Yeah,
it's not,

313
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,500
it's not good for you and we're not 
designed to consume food like that.

314
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,950
I'm just not all these refined 
carbohydrates.

315
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,570
It's a massive part of the modern diet.
It's just,

316
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,390
it's really recent.
Last few hundred years.

317
00:14:28,391 --> 00:14:30,130
Humans have had it in the last hundred 
years,

318
00:14:30,131 --> 00:14:32,200
has changed pretty radically.
I um,

319
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,010
I went to this thing called the summit,
which is Kinda like a giant Ted talk and

320
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,060
I did some stand up there and just end 
up at it.

321
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,710
I just went.
How many people did stand up there?

322
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,390
It just meat Bengali.
You've invited me.

323
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,700
And so I went,
um,

324
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,280
what has been doing there?
He did some stand up before and uh,

325
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,770
so I did it and then after,
you know,

326
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,190
it fosters this environment

327
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,890
of sort of open mindedness and just talk
and you can just talk to people.

328
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,440
And I,
it was the first week of the Diet,

329
00:14:57,441 --> 00:15:02,441
so I had the Keto flu and I had to leave
the comedy store one night I had a 

330
00:15:02,441 --> 00:15:07,181
second show and I was talking to Steve 
Simone about cheese and I almost threw 

331
00:15:07,181 --> 00:15:11,111
up and I was like,
I have to go home because my own diet 

332
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:11,300
was making me so nauseous because that's
part of it.

333
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,800
You get sick at the beginning I never 
got the,

334
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,880
I just got tired to the point where it 
was fucking with my workouts so my 

335
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,201
workouts folds flat.
But exoticness ketones are the way to 

336
00:15:23,201 --> 00:15:23,810
kill that.
So I was taking those two.

337
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,820
But it's also,
you're kinda like you're reading stuff 

338
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,121
and you're kind of sussing out what 
works for you and trying to find the 

339
00:15:31,121 --> 00:15:31,121
right balance.

340
00:15:31,121 --> 00:15:31,880
Anyways.
I was not feeling well,

341
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:33,890
but I was talking to everyone about this
diet.

342
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,360
I was like,
this could not be more La.

343
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:35,900
I'm like,
hi,

344
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:36,860
I'm Eliza.
I'm on a diet.

345
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,840
Check it out.
Like on the Keto Diet,

346
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,750
the Keto Diet,
that's big La.

347
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,850
And it's also like an intense thing,
like you're changing everything.

348
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,210
So I.
and so when you say you have a diet,

349
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:48,620
people want to tell you what's wrong 
with it.

350
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:53,860
And I was like,
my favorite part of a diet is people 

351
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,571
telling me how wrong I am for spending 
all this money and doing this and this 

352
00:15:55,571 --> 00:15:55,700
one guy came up and he's like,
I'm a Vegan.

353
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:56,870
And I was like,
okay.

354
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,840
And he starts explaining why he's 
basically a better person.

355
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,900
And I was like,
but your shoes are leather so fuck you.

356
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,730
And I was like,
okay.

357
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,010
He's like,
you're impacting the world in a negative

358
00:16:07,011 --> 00:16:07,250
way.

359
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,030
I'm like,
okay,

360
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:09,240
but do you recycle?
And like,

361
00:16:09,241 --> 00:16:11,480
no,
like we all do what we can.

362
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:16,610
And you're not a better person just 
because you happen to eat only herbs and

363
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:21,611
maybe you don't drive a prius.
Like who knows where you're making your 

364
00:16:21,611 --> 00:16:23,030
shitty.
The desire to project that on people.

365
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,800
Absolutely.
I was like this.

366
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:26,360
I don't say I'm not telling anyone to do
it.

367
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:31,361
I was just saying what I'm doing.
I'm going to mean you're not saying 

368
00:16:31,361 --> 00:16:33,701
you're a better person,
but him saying he's a better person for 

369
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:33,701
that or he didn't say he was acting 
like.

370
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:38,441
You know what I'm saying?
It's one of the reasons why people do 

371
00:16:38,441 --> 00:16:38,441
those.
This moral high ground that they take.

372
00:16:38,441 --> 00:16:38,530
That being said,
that being said,

373
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,330
when I see people eating garbage,
I do feel superior.

374
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,630
I'm not hungry.
Well,

375
00:16:42,631 --> 00:16:44,420
you realize they're doing something bad 
or their body.

376
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,670
It's way I feel when I see someone 
smoking cigarettes,

377
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:52,460
man,
but I'm not going to say something to 

378
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,601
you.
You should walk up to them and start 

379
00:16:54,601 --> 00:16:54,601
coughing.
Okay.

380
00:16:54,601 --> 00:16:57,370
Can I tell you,
I was at starbucks the other day and I 

381
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,731
just was running in to grab an espresso 
shot because I have one every time I 

382
00:17:00,731 --> 00:17:02,640
work out and I go in and there's a girl 
there and were comic.

383
00:17:02,641 --> 00:17:05,570
So a big part of our job is sort of 
scanning people,

384
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:08,060
identifying what they are,
making assumptions because we're usually

385
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:13,061
right.
So this girl in front of me and she's 

386
00:17:13,061 --> 00:17:13,360
standing there holding a snack because 
usually we're usually right.

387
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,640
That's why we're successful and she's 
holding her snacks and,

388
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:20,310
and I can see that she's Kinda weighing 
her options and I see you're putting out

389
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,450
and I see her grab a banana.
So to me,

390
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:26,810
for the most part when women do that,
it is about a dietary thing.

391
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:31,810
You're trying to lose weight.
She looked like she was maybe going to 

392
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:31,810
the gym.
I don't know.

393
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,020
So just trying to be a good girl to 
another girl.

394
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,520
I just,
because I thought she was making like a 

395
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,511
sugar based decision.
I go bananas full of sugar just because 

396
00:17:40,511 --> 00:17:44,051
I didn't know that I did it because 
someone told that to me because you 

397
00:17:44,051 --> 00:17:44,480
always think of bananas healthy.
You put it in a smoothie shake.

398
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,630
I didn't know so much sugar so I just 
said it just as a like,

399
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:48,950
hey girlfriend,
I didn't know this.

400
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,750
And so she and,
and Oh God,

401
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:56,751
what did she say?
She looked at me and she said something 

402
00:17:56,751 --> 00:17:56,751
and she was.
And then the,

403
00:17:56,751 --> 00:17:56,751
the,
the,

404
00:17:56,751 --> 00:17:59,100
the Barista like gotta tune.
She goes,

405
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,960
fruit has a lot of sugar.
I go,

406
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:06,050
well,
blueberries have a load by simic index 

407
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:06,050
and just bananas have more.

408
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:06,090
I just didn't know that was it.
I was just trying to be cool.

409
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,360
I leave.
I'm walking through the courtyard and I 

410
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:11,360
hear this,
excuse me,

411
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,540
and it's the girl from inside and she 
goes,

412
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,520
did you know dying?
Your hair causes cancer.

413
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:14,940
Oh,
I'm sorry.

414
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:17,100
That was it in the place.
I go to the banana sugar.

415
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:18,390
She goes,
but it has potassium,

416
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,470
and I go,
well,

417
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:20,900
we don't really know what potassium does
doing.

418
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,110
I mean,
we know what's in bananas.

419
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:27,170
Like I was just trying to be funny and I
leave and she comes across when she 

420
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,891
goes,
do you know the dying to hear it causes 

421
00:18:30,891 --> 00:18:30,891
cancer?
And Joe,

422
00:18:30,891 --> 00:18:30,891
I thought she was fucking with me.
And I go,

423
00:18:30,891 --> 00:18:35,180
yeah,
but there's a lot of potassium and hair 

424
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:35,180
dye.
And she goes,

425
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:35,180
you really shouldn't tell people what 
they should and shouldn't eat.

426
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,750
You don't know what I'm going through.
And I was like,

427
00:18:36,751 --> 00:18:38,610
I do now.
Crazy.

428
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,640
Oh crazy.
That is crazy.

429
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,770
That is crazy.
It's crazy.

430
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,550
Oh,
for sure.

431
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,610
Oh yeah.
Are fucking.

432
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:52,850
If you're gonna like you're gonna attack
on me in a courtyard and tell me to go 

433
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:56,490
fuck myself because I just said bananas.
Have she got like so offended?

434
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,270
Well you are slim and maybe she was not.
She was fine.

435
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:01,610
She was fine.
Looking fine.

436
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,890
Maybe she has a body image thing who 
doesn't?

437
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,920
My point is if you can't suss out,
but I was just making tommy super 

438
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,310
comfortable as body.
I'm pretty comfortable with my.

439
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:15,830
Alright.
But the point is I get and I asked 

440
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:15,830
everyone,
I was like,

441
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,490
was I wrong?
And sometimes you just catch someone.

442
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:21,120
Like I've always described it this way,
like most people all day long,

443
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:26,121
if you're lucky,
people are at like a two or a three out 

444
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:28,581
of 10 on the outrage scale.
But you might run into someone who's at 

445
00:19:28,581 --> 00:19:28,581
a nine.
They just,

446
00:19:28,581 --> 00:19:31,920
they might've just got dumped their car.
My be getting repossessed.

447
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:36,921
They might've just got fired.
They might just got yelled at by their 

448
00:19:36,921 --> 00:19:40,011
mom.
There might be like a whole series of 

449
00:19:40,011 --> 00:19:40,011
things and behind her with the fucking 
banana,

450
00:19:40,011 --> 00:19:41,750
banana sugar,
just bitch.

451
00:19:41,751 --> 00:19:46,751
If you're listening,
which I doubt it because you don't seem 

452
00:19:46,751 --> 00:19:46,751
like the kind of person that wants to be
enlightened,

453
00:19:46,751 --> 00:19:48,410
but if you're listening,
this is not a good apology.

454
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,010
Knows about cancer and hair dye and 
that's what she wanted to tell you.

455
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,650
Well,
I'm not going to not be blond.

456
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:57,490
I'm not gonna.
Walk around with like roots just because

457
00:19:57,491 --> 00:19:58,490
it causes cancer.
Maybe.

458
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,390
I'm sorry if I offended you.
I'm sorry.

459
00:20:01,391 --> 00:20:03,220
Banana Lady.
Banana ladies.

460
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,540
Do you need a hug?
Um,

461
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,210
does,
does hair dye actually caused cancer?

462
00:20:07,211 --> 00:20:09,730
I've never read that.
Doesn't like,

463
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,930
doesn't involve.
Well,

464
00:20:10,931 --> 00:20:13,720
living in a city causes cancer for sure.
Oh my God.

465
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,900
It's got a big time for you.
They say they say they say that living 

466
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,490
near a highway I give you live within a 
certain distance of a highway.

467
00:20:21,491 --> 00:20:23,230
Can Shave 10 years off your life.

468
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,050
I believe that not just from small,
but anxiety.

469
00:20:27,051 --> 00:20:32,051
I believe twitter is slowly killing us 
to really do twitter and I have a foil 

470
00:20:32,051 --> 00:20:36,200
helmet to prove it.
I the amount of anxiety it causes.

471
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,150
I think the bad far outweighs the good.

472
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:43,290
Do you,
do you like read comments and talk back 

473
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,150
to people and have conversation now and 
I had a conversation at the improv where

474
00:20:46,151 --> 00:20:51,151
you were frantic.
That sounds like a year ago you were 

475
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:52,540
getting into it with someone.
God dammit,

476
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:53,890
I wish I could remember what it was 
about,

477
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:58,891
but you are fucking pissed and you were 
frantic and you had been going at it 

478
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,510
with all these people and they were 
pissed at you.

479
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,170
Do you remember

480
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,580
the make America great again?
Thing that I went through,

481
00:21:03,581 --> 00:21:08,581
which was horrible,
but I could have been something about 

482
00:21:08,581 --> 00:21:11,821
racism.
Sounds like my running with Hashtag 

483
00:21:11,821 --> 00:21:11,821
Maga.

484
00:21:11,821 --> 00:21:15,380
Maybe that's what it was,
but we were in the front of the Improv 

485
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,171
and you were so fucking frantic and 
angry and frustrated and I said it was 

486
00:21:18,241 --> 00:21:20,910
just don't read that stuff.
Just don't.

487
00:21:20,911 --> 00:21:22,080
Don't,
don't engage.

488
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:23,880
Like you wouldn't engage with those 
people in real life.

489
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:24,810
You're like,
you're right,

490
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,690
but I have to fucking tell them because 
they say this.

491
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,060
I can genuinely tell you this.
I gave it up.

492
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,960
I had like my own thing.
I did this interview and some girls got 

493
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,190
like butthurt over something and it was 
then that I was just like,

494
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:40,180
you know what,
I'm done.

495
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,290
I'm done reading all of this,
so I'll skim it once in a while for like

496
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:49,380
a,
like a retweet about something or if 

497
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:49,380
someone's posting something,
but I,

498
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,280
if you look at my tweets,
they're all just sort of self 

499
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,280
generating.
There's Vr,

500
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,730
there's no responses anymore.
I've just decided like you're following 

501
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:57,480
me for a reason.
So what I say is the,

502
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:02,580
is what I'm saying and I don't need to 
backtrack and that's just the stance 

503
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,450
that I've taken because it really is 
like screaming into a pillow.

504
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,790
That's all it is.
Like with all and by the way,

505
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:13,820
but don't you find interesting?
Do you find interesting things and then 

506
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:13,820
tweet them out to people like,
hey,

507
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,120
look at this cool article I just read.

508
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,790
I will retweet people's things if I 
think someone's brilliant.

509
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,800
There's this girl just to whack who I 
can't stop talking about,

510
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:23,890
uh,
who has single handedly upending the 

511
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:24,340
trump administration.
Like her tweets are so brilliant.

512
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,710
Just dweck.
How do you think it's dw?

513
00:22:27,711 --> 00:22:28,070
E,
C,

514
00:22:28,071 --> 00:22:29,310
k?
I think I phone.

515
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,290
She's just so good and I just believe in
if something's good,

516
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:35,630
perpetuating it and putting it out 
there.

517
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,300
So I retweet hers.
If somebody says something funny,

518
00:22:38,301 --> 00:22:39,260
I retweet it,
but.

519
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:42,020
And,
but I don't answer people.

520
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,620
Dew,
W e,

521
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,960
c,
k dot just get ready for a boost.

522
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,380
Yeah,
they're just hot fire.

523
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,540
But she does a good job.
So I like to retweet it.

524
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,720
The dweck is her,
her name,

525
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,200
she was on a show I did last night.
I did a women only invite show and she 

526
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,890
did a women only.
Could I go if I wore drag?

527
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:08,950
No,
I'm not allowed to know because I'd be 

528
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:08,950
like,
what if I identify as a woman?

529
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,470
So people ask that and I was just like,
you can come,

530
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,680
but no one did that.
Oh,

531
00:23:15,681 --> 00:23:18,380
you can come if you identify as a trans 
woman.

532
00:23:18,381 --> 00:23:23,381
I'm not going to be the one to tell you.
You just figured it out like five 

533
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:26,141
minutes before the show here.
Here's why you can't because it's about 

534
00:23:26,141 --> 00:23:28,730
a lifetime as a woman.
So if you were always a man,

535
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,940
you probably just aren't going through 
the same things that a woman who's a 

536
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,790
woman was born a woman,
but you can come.

537
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,740
I'm not going to be the one to say no.
Um,

538
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,360
what's your stance on Trans racialism?
It's okay.

539
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,210
Oh,
sorry.

540
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:41,540
No,
no,

541
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:43,180
I didn't get the with the like,
uh,

542
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,520
the Rachel dolezal person.

543
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,040
I don't think it works.
You can't be another race.

544
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,770
Well,
how can you be a woman then?

545
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,970
How can a man be a woman?
What if you really aren't hockey?

546
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:59,130
If a man feels like he's a woman,
why is that different than a man feeling

547
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,410
like he's like.
There was one I tweeted yesterday,

548
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,260
a guy who believes he's Filipino,
he was born.

549
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,680
I think he's transgender as well.
He's got both things going on.

550
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,660
You know,
I think it's people that just don't like

551
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,060
who they are and they feel like a 
radical shift.

552
00:24:13,061 --> 00:24:16,570
There is transracial man born white says
he feels Filipino.

553
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,490
And by the way,
that makes it into USA Today.

554
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:22,450
Is he a nurse news?
Maybe that's why he feels that scrubs.

555
00:24:22,451 --> 00:24:24,610
It's like tie dye,
looks like scrubs a.

556
00:24:24,611 --> 00:24:28,810
This is where he has purple highlights 
in his hair or can I just say that?

557
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:33,370
It seems to be the issue is when white 
wants to be another color,

558
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:37,600
everybody has been forced to sort of 
take on white characteristics.

559
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,210
Black girls flattened their hair,
nose jobs.

560
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,700
Do you know about Sammy Sosa?
Yeah.

561
00:24:42,701 --> 00:24:44,440
And getting lighter.
Do you know what he looks like now?

562
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:44,920
Yes,
I do.

563
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,710
Because he looks like you.
He looks just like 10.

564
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:52,730
He knows he doesn't have a tiny nose,
but he has like literally your color 

565
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,090
skin.
So my best friend,

566
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:58,260
her wife is Dominican and she posted a 
picture of it and she was like,

567
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,780
this is not a joke.
It's so sad that he feels that he has to

568
00:25:01,781 --> 00:25:02,200
do this.

569
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,750
Holy Shit.
Just look at that.

570
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,930
He's a fat white concept.
The Gerber baby,

571
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:14,070
I mean I guess he got it off the 
steroids and that's when his body sort 

572
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,670
of started getting fucked up and it 
doesn't work out anymore.

573
00:25:15,671 --> 00:25:20,671
So he's big now.
But the white is outraged when you try 

574
00:25:20,671 --> 00:25:24,181
to be white.
I think people of color get angry when 

575
00:25:24,181 --> 00:25:24,181
it goes the other way.
Right?

576
00:25:24,181 --> 00:25:28,200
Because they're like,
you don't get to just take on our look 

577
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,600
as a costume.
That I think that's the social issue.

578
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,100
Yeah.
Not for sure.

579
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:30,970
But that's,
that's.

580
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,500
I guess that's my only answer.
Right?

581
00:25:32,501 --> 00:25:35,350
But what if that's what you really feel 
like you would be happy?

582
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,430
I didn't do it to a privately,
privately where,

583
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,480
uh,
a Dominican Day parade costume under 

584
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:44,560
your overcoat.
We can get away with some of it.

585
00:25:44,561 --> 00:25:46,210
Right?
Like affectations,

586
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:51,211
like you can get away with like if 
you're a rapper you could sort of talk 

587
00:25:51,211 --> 00:25:54,420
or MC search.
I think it's like teetering on that 

588
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:54,490
line.
Who's MC search?

589
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,230
You don't remember the third base.

590
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,640
He used to have a,
a,

591
00:25:57,641 --> 00:26:02,641
a TV show and it was horrible.
It was a talk show,

592
00:26:03,001 --> 00:26:05,400
but he was going to keep it real.
And it was.

593
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,650
Yeah.
It was so bad that opie and anthony used

594
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:11,970
to play clips from MC search show.
Yes.

595
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:13,410
That's him.
Is He Jewish?

596
00:26:13,411 --> 00:26:15,570
Because we do this.
We love hip hop.

597
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,470
Yes.
Yeah,

598
00:26:16,471 --> 00:26:19,710
that's from back in the day.
I was a big fan of third base.

599
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,450
I love them as a,
as a band,

600
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,650
but his show,
well,

601
00:26:22,651 --> 00:26:27,651
you know what his show,
here's the difference between his show 

602
00:26:27,651 --> 00:26:29,360
and what his show could be.
He,

603
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,690
uh,
that's awful,

604
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,730
but he thinks he's being choked out by 
like he was all.

605
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,940
He was also wearing makeup and he was 
also being,

606
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:40,970
I'm sure produced.
You got to be yourself and you can't be 

607
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:40,970
yourself.
If you're on a fucking network,

608
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,240
you just can't.
They're not going to let you,

609
00:26:42,241 --> 00:26:44,220
they're going to force you some box.
They're gonna,

610
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,200
they're gonna.
Figure out a way to sell you like,

611
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,510
this is what you're going to be.
You're going to be the.

612
00:26:47,511 --> 00:26:50,880
This guy did a pilot for look at them.
Hey search,

613
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,440
I think it was oxygen.
And they were like,

614
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:54,420
we need you to say things like,
keep it 100.

615
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,980
Ooh,
can you say that for me?

616
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,460
Keep it 100.
I like it.

617
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:01,170
Keep it $100.
Nobody says that you stupid.

618
00:27:01,171 --> 00:27:02,400
Fuck.
There was a while ago,

619
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,650
but this is how dumb they are.
People write that.

620
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,570
They don't fucking say it.
No one says,

621
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:08,280
keep it 100.
You dumb cunt.

622
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:09,300
Who are you?

623
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,910
But it's always that.
I always watched TV.

624
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:20,580
Advertising is always one step removed 
from what's cool now because by the time

625
00:27:20,581 --> 00:27:22,990
they push it through corporate too late,
it's like,

626
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,260
guess what?
No one's saying it anymore.

627
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,270
Right.
Remember was up.

628
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:31,280
Remember that one guy that had that 
great video where it was like him 

629
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,160
calling his friends was friends.
Like was.

630
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:35,100
It was a hilarious.
That was like the nineties,

631
00:27:35,101 --> 00:27:40,101
right?
Here's another one that bothers me when 

632
00:27:40,101 --> 00:27:40,101
people say I almost threw up in my 
mouth.

633
00:27:40,101 --> 00:27:40,530
Oh,
you didn't invent it.

634
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,940
Stop using it in commercials.
Yeah.

635
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,100
That's not good.
Bad.

636
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,860
Yeah.
There's a bunch of those that they use.

637
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:47,640
They go,
Ooh,

638
00:27:47,641 --> 00:27:51,490
this will connect with the kids will be 
able to sell more things.

639
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,730
Well,
the worst is when like exact SCO.

640
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,010
We want it.
We want to make a viral video.

641
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,000
I'm like,
you can't,

642
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,650
it becomes viral.

643
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,200
It goes viral,
will make a viral video.

644
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,700
And then what was the other one?
Um,

645
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,980
when people.
It's bingeable.

646
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,660
When I was on free form,
we want bingeable.

647
00:28:06,661 --> 00:28:07,890
We want everyone to binge.
I'm like,

648
00:28:07,891 --> 00:28:12,891
you don't decide that you're going to 
binge it just because you put all your 

649
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:15,621
content out there.
You binged things because you decide 

650
00:28:15,621 --> 00:28:16,650
bingeable taught.
It's now it's fresh.

651
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:20,580
Oh God.
How can you be in that industry and keep

652
00:28:20,581 --> 00:28:21,720
it real?
That's what I want to know.

653
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,180
Can You keep it real?
Can You keep it 100.

654
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,070
Look at that lady.
Oh,

655
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,850
what is she doing?
Is She doing the Dab?

656
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:32,230
Dab It on him.
Are you sure she's dabbing or she just 

657
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:32,230
doing Tai Chi in the park?
Ah,

658
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:32,230
definitely.
Says it on her shirt,

659
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,530
on a shirt that she doesn't know she's 
wearing.

660
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:39,270
She didn't realize that she can't read 
the no 150,000

661
00:28:39,271 --> 00:28:40,980
years old later,
just keep pounding.

662
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:41,820
Have.
Ooh.

663
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,940
We think it's so funny when old people 
talk as if they were ever young and 

664
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,180
fucking like as if they've never had 
sex.

665
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:53,380
Right?
Like that lady probably at one point in 

666
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:53,640
time was a connoisseur when she's out 
there in the park,

667
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,580
not knowing what the fuck she's wearing.
Dinosaur in the park.

668
00:28:56,581 --> 00:28:59,250
That's probably the best place probably 
to be sampling Dick.

669
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,340
Probably hard to get a good one though 
when you're at that age.

670
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,300
Probably real tough because it's all 
about enthusiasm.

671
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,200
I feel like dudes are pretty down with 
old ladies.

672
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,750
Like old dudes.
You.

673
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,380
Oh yeah.
Well that's an issue.

674
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:18,560
I'm a friend of mine go on.
One of his buddies worked at a old folks

675
00:29:18,751 --> 00:29:23,751
home and said that one of the big issues
was these old guys would get Viagra.

676
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,890
Yeah.
And these old ladies,

677
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:29,190
they didn't give a fuck and a lot of 
them are on antidepressants,

678
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,380
so they're like,
wow,

679
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,560
Allah who gives a shit.

680
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:34,740
Like they're on Xanax and getting stds.
That will.

681
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,500
I don't know if it was that.
That's something that I heard about,

682
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,720
like it's rampant because that's 
happening.

683
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,710
That's probably really bad.
You're old,

684
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:44,770
right?
Like your body doesn't heal so good.

685
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,830
No.
[inaudible] 98.

686
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,490
Herpes is like an attack on your immune 
system.

687
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,740
There it goes.
The new erotic frontier,

688
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,350
sex in nursing homes.
Until recently,

689
00:29:56,351 --> 00:30:00,580
nursing homes frowned on sex.
Now increasingly they smile.

690
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,290
Oh,
well that makes sense.

691
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,910
Why?
Why shouldn't we have fun?

692
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,700
Look at this,
when Aubrey Davidson age,

693
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:11,730
85 minutes,
special guy at the Hebrew home in 

694
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:11,730
Riverdale in the Bronx,
New York,

695
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:14,380
they did more than sit next to each 
other in the dining room.

696
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:19,660
Then he invited her to his room.
They hung a do not disturb sign on the 

697
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:23,380
door and at breakfast the next morning,
they both supported broad smiles,

698
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,730
terrible writing,
but also calling it.

699
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,180
What are the top say the you see the new
erotic frontier.

700
00:30:31,181 --> 00:30:31,570
You're like,
oh,

701
00:30:31,571 --> 00:30:33,310
and it's like sex and nursing homes.
You're like,

702
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,480
oh,
there goes the boner.

703
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,880
Well,
it sounded so hot.

704
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,320
Yeah,
that's not.

705
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:43,470
It's not exciting for me,
but there's a whole category on Youporn 

706
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,520
so old people.
They do.

707
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,230
Some people do like watching old people.
Fuck.

708
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,480
You know what I watched the other day?
I'm not proud of it,

709
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:52,260
but I will admit it to you.
I watched an old thing,

710
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:52,910
my special.

711
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:01,380
I watched an old porn stars still at it.
I don't care what he provides.

712
00:31:01,631 --> 00:31:06,631
Exercise and at the time of life when 
many elderly feel cold sleeping as a 

713
00:31:07,061 --> 00:31:08,590
payer provides warmth.
Oh,

714
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,330
that's cute.
Look at this though,

715
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:15,470
like killed back to the relationships,
make people happier and that happiness 

716
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,710
reduces stress and irritability and 
improves mood,

717
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,060
appetite,
sleep,

718
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,610
sociability and immune function.
So to plants.

719
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:22,610
Read that first day.
Oh,

720
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,120
how dare you read the first sentence 
says the Hebrew home.

721
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,360
That first one at the bottom of the 
Hebrew home does more than tolerate 

722
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,370
resident nookie.
The faculty hope.

723
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:36,160
Probably someone who works with the 
Hebrew home propaganda.

724
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,850
The faculty holds regular happy hours,
dances,

725
00:31:39,851 --> 00:31:43,060
and even organized a dating service for 
residents.

726
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:46,030
Gy Date,
g four grandparents.

727
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,680
I like it.
That's great.

728
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,330
Whatever.
No one's getting hurt.

729
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,380
Yeah,
cares.

730
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,570
And they're enjoying themselves.
Fought for our country.

731
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,570
Some of them probably did let him fuck.
This is like an age,

732
00:31:55,571 --> 00:31:58,060
like might have been a few draft dodgers
from Vietnam in that mix.

733
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,000
What about Korea?
But by the way,

734
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,350
by the way,
he needed one of those wars,

735
00:32:02,351 --> 00:32:03,790
but they're really fighting for our 
country,

736
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,530
but no,
but they still went.

737
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:09,460
They still went to Vietnam was a draft.
That was a horrible thing,

738
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:11,260
but they still went.
They still went.

739
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:14,230
Well,
it's not their fault.

740
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:16,320
It was a bullshit war,
it was a bullshit for sure,

741
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,970
but it's not their fault.
Who was the most bullshit war?

742
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,230
The most bullshit war.
What was the most bullshit war?

743
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,140
Because it was literally founded on 
bullshit.

744
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:26,160
Do you know about the Gulf of Tonkin?
I know talking to them a,

745
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:31,710
you know,
it was a false flag that caught us into 

746
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:31,710
Vietnam has never happened.
This Gulf,

747
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,370
the Gulf of Tonkin incident as it.
I'll take a step further.

748
00:32:33,371 --> 00:32:38,371
I think the threat of communism is 
something that we like to do to scare 

749
00:32:38,371 --> 00:32:41,280
Americans and the poor Laotians got 
caught in the middle of all of this.

750
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,800
I went to Vietnam and they still have.
I'm sorry.

751
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:48,830
I went to Cambodia and they still have 
like active minds because they dropped,

752
00:32:48,831 --> 00:32:51,220
we dropped,
I think more bombs was.

753
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,680
It was several million or something and 
it's still an active thing,

754
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,110
like people are still losing body parts 
to this.

755
00:32:57,111 --> 00:32:57,890
Sure.
Farmers.

756
00:32:57,891 --> 00:32:58,790
So we're just like,
oops,

757
00:32:58,791 --> 00:32:59,870
a daisy,
sorry.

758
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,730
And they're not an angry people.

759
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:06,870
I don't know if the threat of communism 
was perceived as real because I think if

760
00:33:07,391 --> 00:33:12,391
you look at the rest of the world,
like we were obviously in conflict with 

761
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:12,391
the Soviet Union.
They were worried about China,

762
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:16,950
the Marxism and Mao and all the various 
issues that people have overcome.

763
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,620
I think they were worried that communism
was going to spread.

764
00:33:20,621 --> 00:33:25,621
I think it just one of those things 
where once a witch hunt starts like the 

765
00:33:25,621 --> 00:33:27,290
mccarthyism area,
that's,

766
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:32,310
that's really fucking scary.
That shit where they were going after 

767
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,220
people and ruining their lives.
They'd went to a meeting.

768
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,070
Sure.
Like if you went to a communist meeting,

769
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,860
I mean we definitely blacklisting 
people,

770
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,050
you know,
and it's,

771
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,140
it's a fine line because it's like,
well you're Americans,

772
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:44,210
you have these rights.
And then like,

773
00:33:44,211 --> 00:33:49,211
who's deciding that line?
I wonder if we're kind of getting into 

774
00:33:49,211 --> 00:33:52,001
that now with what we're able to say 
online with the whole sexual Predator 

775
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:55,010
thing,
which if you want to talk about draining

776
00:33:55,011 --> 00:33:57,500
a swamp,
like it's great what's happening now,

777
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,630
but then you're going to get guys who 
are like,

778
00:33:59,631 --> 00:34:00,830
I never did anything.
It's like,

779
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:01,310
well,
sorry,

780
00:34:01,311 --> 00:34:02,480
now no one wants to work with you.

781
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:07,750
Well,
there's people that are absolutely 

782
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,420
guilty that are getting caught and then 
there's people for sure they're going to

783
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:11,420
get accused by people who really just 
want attention.

784
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:16,870
You can have that too,
but I think you're going to have way 

785
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:16,870
less.
Okay.

786
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:19,140
I think you're gonna have less of that 
because I think the stakes are so high 

787
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,170
that for you to do that,
for you to be the type of person that 

788
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:22,810
accuses someone just for your own 
personal gain.

789
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:28,260
I feel like it's not going to happen as 
much just because it's such a serious 

790
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:28,260
thing right now.

791
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:31,920
It's a serious thing,
but there's so much weirdness to elect 

792
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,360
George Sekai.
A guy says he grabbed his dick in 1981.

793
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,170
Hey Dude.

794
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,630
You let it go.
Walk it off.

795
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,010
Walk it off.
I'm sorry.

796
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:40,530
It's also.
It's not as damaging as it is when a man

797
00:34:40,531 --> 00:34:42,150
does it to a young woman.
Percent.

798
00:34:42,151 --> 00:34:43,230
Thank you for saying that.

799
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:49,240
That's so true.
I've been saying this on stage and I 

800
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:49,240
have a bit.
I don't.

801
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,460
I want to reveal it here,
but I,

802
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:54,140
there's a big difference between being 
threatened for your life,

803
00:34:54,141 --> 00:34:57,140
like if you're dealing with a situation 
like,

804
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,130
all right,
this is not the throw Louis ck under the

805
00:35:01,131 --> 00:35:02,930
bus,
but someone was saying like,

806
00:35:02,931 --> 00:35:04,730
what's the big deal?
Someone masturbating in front of you?

807
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,800
This is what I,
this is what I said.

808
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,870
They've never had it happen.
You're a man.

809
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,740
Yup.
Okay.

810
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:11,690
And if a woman was masturbating in front
of me,

811
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,300
I would not be worried.
Not threatened for your safety.

812
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:16,010
I would exactly.
That'd be like,

813
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,080
okay,
you want to do that?

814
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:22,940
But if a man is doing it and they're 
blocking the door and it's a man that,

815
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,970
look,
I was in the green room,

816
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,150
not the green room.
The um,

817
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,710
uh,
the bar area,

818
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:29,380
the comedy store,
you know,

819
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:32,540
that little narrow pathway.
And this guy walked by,

820
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,380
it was about three months ago and he was
six foot seven,

821
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,880
300 plus pounds.
And He,

822
00:35:38,881 --> 00:35:41,550
when he walked by me,
I just looked at him.

823
00:35:41,551 --> 00:35:43,530
He looked at me.
I got physically nervous,

824
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,020
physically nervous.
Like I was thinking,

825
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:48,750
okay,
if this guy decided he was going to kill

826
00:35:48,751 --> 00:35:50,100
me,
he was going to smash me.

827
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,550
There's almost nothing I can do about.
He's so much bigger than me.

828
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,260
That is how almost every woman feels 
around a large man.

829
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:02,900
This is the thesis for my last special 
for confirmed kills your thesis.

830
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:05,570
I talk about it.
It's added at length.

831
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:08,840
How it all goes back to the fact,
all of the suppression,

832
00:36:08,841 --> 00:36:11,540
all of your nervousness as a woman,
all of it goes back to the fact that men

833
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:15,860
are physically stronger than women in.
My whole joke is if we were stronger,

834
00:36:15,861 --> 00:36:18,170
if women were stronger,
we wouldn't have waited for the right to

835
00:36:18,171 --> 00:36:20,740
vote would have been like,
I'm going to the polls out of the way.

836
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:25,770
Jeddah diet like it just went.
So it all goes back to that and I think 

837
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:30,101
for some guys it's hard to grasp what 
that feels like to feel physically 

838
00:36:30,101 --> 00:36:32,180
inferior because it's not mental,
mentally inferior.

839
00:36:32,181 --> 00:36:37,181
It's not someone's funnier.
Your life is threatened when a guy 

840
00:36:37,181 --> 00:36:37,570
blocks the door,
when a guys in your weight,

841
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:40,030
when you're in some guy's home and maybe
he doesn't want to hear it.

842
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,110
No,
he can kill you.

843
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:47,540
That's all the.
Even a guy that's not that much bigger 

844
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,781
than me is still exponentially stronger 
than me and that's just the way we're 

845
00:36:49,781 --> 00:36:50,660
designed.
It's not every woman is not every man,

846
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,990
but women live with that fear.
So it's so insane.

847
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,070
You know,
they're like,

848
00:36:55,071 --> 00:36:57,710
he jerked off in front of them and at 
the time,

849
00:36:57,711 --> 00:36:59,090
you know,
this is a very valid thing.

850
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:04,130
Like at the time I didn't know what was 
happening because your brain isn't 

851
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,330
designed to handle like a famous 
comedians masturbating in front of me.

852
00:37:05,331 --> 00:37:06,320
I'll file this away.

853
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,340
Well,
not only that,

854
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,070
how about it comes out of the blue.
How about,

855
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:12,830
how about you process it?
You and I are friends.

856
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:17,980
We've been friends for a long time.
If we were in some hotel room somewhere 

857
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,500
and I said,
can I jerk off in front of you?

858
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,550
You'd be like,
what?

859
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,150
Yeah,
you probably wouldn't eat.

860
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:24,380
This is not like a rational request.
Like,

861
00:37:24,381 --> 00:37:25,970
Hey,
do you want to get some food?

862
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,700
Hey,
let's let's go to the bar.

863
00:37:28,701 --> 00:37:30,800
Hey,
there's no neurological path to this.

864
00:37:30,801 --> 00:37:31,250
Where it's like,
yeah,

865
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:34,730
we'll go to the food bar and get food.
You just opened a door and dropped off a

866
00:37:34,731 --> 00:37:35,240
cliff

867
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,590
and you're just.
You're grabbing onto anything.

868
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:43,591
So they giggle.
They laugh because that's a natural 

869
00:37:43,591 --> 00:37:43,591
reaction.
You're like,

870
00:37:43,591 --> 00:37:44,050
okay,
you can't believe it's happening.

871
00:37:44,051 --> 00:37:46,060
A lot of girls like Ali reisman just 
came out,

872
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:47,670
the gymnast,
her,

873
00:37:47,671 --> 00:37:51,430
the Olympic doctor was molesting her and
another girl as well,

874
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,070
and the guy's already in prison for 
child porn,

875
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:58,720
which is so insane I think at the time,
especially when you're younger.

876
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:04,140
I have good friends who were like,
I was basically raped or assaulted and 

877
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,690
at the time you're laughing and going 
along with it because you don't know,

878
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,710
like your brain is like almost shutting 
down.

879
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,750
You're like,
I don't know

880
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,350
that it's not okay.
Well,

881
00:38:12,351 --> 00:38:14,000
especially if you're really young,
right?

882
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,230
Sure.
I mean,

883
00:38:15,231 --> 00:38:20,231
you're.
If you're a young kid and you're not 

884
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:20,231
exactly sure you don't have a context 
for this action,

885
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,010
right.
So sudden it's happening.

886
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,080
You don't know.
Just don't,

887
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:29,220
you don't understand,
like I almost got scooped up by a child 

888
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,080
molester once when I was really young.
I was like,

889
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:35,740
I guess it was like eight or nine.
I was in the library and I was looking 

890
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,450
at these books and this guy came up to 
me and I was looking at.

891
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:41,470
I was always in a monster books,
like monster movies and this guy came up

892
00:38:41,471 --> 00:38:41,860
to me.
He's like,

893
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:43,330
you're a monster books.
And I go,

894
00:38:43,331 --> 00:38:44,410
yeah.
And he goes,

895
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,540
I've got some monster books in my car.
You want to see him?

896
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,400
So okay,
got a monster in my pants.

897
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:50,890
I didn't know any better and know I was 
fucking eight years old or whatever.

898
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,520
So I start walking out to his car in the
librarian sees him and me and start 

899
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,490
screaming.
She said,

900
00:38:57,491 --> 00:38:59,230
Joseph,
you keep away from that man.

901
00:38:59,231 --> 00:39:00,770
He just got out of jail.
Oh my God.

902
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:03,010
I was crying and I ran to her and the 
guy ran away.

903
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,790
But I think to myself like I had no 
idea.

904
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:08,820
I didn't know what a child molester was.
Sure.

905
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:09,670
I didn't understand.

906
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:12,130
You don't know.
And even if he tried to touch you,

907
00:39:12,131 --> 00:39:13,450
you're like,
this feels weird.

908
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:17,380
I know I don't like this.
It's just such a gray area and our,

909
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,790
our sexuality,
Dr.

910
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:23,791
Right.
For a doctor to like abuse and you 

911
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:23,791
think,
oh,

912
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:23,791
maybe he's touching me.
He needs to be doing that.

913
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:26,140
I don't know what went on.
But your sexuality,

914
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:29,050
especially as you're younger is so 
vulnerable.

915
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:31,210
Like if you want to fuck up a girl's 
life,

916
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:36,240
all you gotta do is go over and like 
grab her boobs as an adult and like 

917
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,960
that's it.
Just go up and grab some young kids Dick

918
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,720
or like touch a woman's vagina and 
you're fucked.

919
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:43,750
Like it's such of precious vulnerable 
thing.

920
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,690
The fact that any of us get out 
unscathed is America.

921
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:50,990
I had another one when I was 14.
No 13 wasn't in high school yet,

922
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,320
so it was like the year before high 
school I used to go fishing at this lake

923
00:39:54,321 --> 00:39:56,330
and there was this old dude that used to
come by the lake.

924
00:39:56,331 --> 00:40:01,331
He was jogging all the time.
Me and my buddies would fish there and 

925
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:03,710
he was a former professor and he Kumbaya
and talked to us.

926
00:40:03,711 --> 00:40:08,711
He was always like really smart and 
articulate and interesting to talk to 

927
00:40:08,711 --> 00:40:10,370
and it would sit with us while we're 
fishing and talk to us.

928
00:40:10,371 --> 00:40:11,930
It was always super friendly and then he
drove up,

929
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,960
drive off or run off.
And then one day I went over his house 

930
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,610
and I didn't think anything of it 
because I'd been around the sky all the 

931
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:22,630
time.
And He um,

932
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:27,650
he watched me pee in the bathroom.
Didn't think anything of that either,

933
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,750
like grown man watching me.

934
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:34,750
P is like normal.
And then like maybe a week later he 

935
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:39,551
showed up at the pond where we would 
fish and he was drunk and he told me he 

936
00:40:40,881 --> 00:40:44,520
loved me and I remember thinking like,
Oh,

937
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,850
I don't know.
Okay.

938
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,680
I like you too because I'm fishing.
At the time it was like,

939
00:40:48,681 --> 00:40:52,910
what the fuck is this guy going on?
And we're in a weird area of the pond.

940
00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:57,911
There was like no one around.
And it was like a lot of trees and 

941
00:40:57,911 --> 00:40:58,040
bushes and shit.
It was,

942
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:00,730
it was sketchy and our memory said this 
to me,

943
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:05,740
said something about something along the
lines of you can't have love without 

944
00:41:05,901 --> 00:41:07,940
sex,
just out of the blue.

945
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,110
Yeah.
That's his opening.

946
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,180
Yeah.
He said he loved me and he said,

947
00:41:11,181 --> 00:41:13,280
you know,
there can't be any love without sex.

948
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,390
I said,
what,

949
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:17,300
what the fuck?
And I had a knife and I remember I had a

950
00:41:17,301 --> 00:41:21,170
knife and I put my hand in my pocket.
I like a little folding knife and I held

951
00:41:21,171 --> 00:41:26,171
onto it in my pocket and I told him he 
had to get away from me and then I'm 

952
00:41:26,171 --> 00:41:29,330
leaving and he told me I was 
overreacting and I reeled in my line and

953
00:41:29,331 --> 00:41:30,230
got out of there,
but I was like,

954
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,930
this guy wants to do something to me.
I'm,

955
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,150
I can do anything.
I'm like,

956
00:41:35,151 --> 00:41:37,490
maybe I might be able to stab them.
Probably not.

957
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,470
You know,
it's definitely,

958
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,690
I think about that because

959
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,690
especially as a girl,
and I hate to keep saying that,

960
00:41:44,691 --> 00:41:45,770
but it really does.
Like,

961
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:47,450
it does affect us the most.
And you know,

962
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:48,800
you get in these,
Uber's like,

963
00:41:48,801 --> 00:41:50,480
you're like,
I'll just get in with this dude,

964
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:55,540
right?
I'll just get in this cab and hope that 

965
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:55,540
he's not going to snap today.
You know what,

966
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,900
even a cab,
it's a guy's actual car,

967
00:41:56,901 --> 00:42:01,901
right?
So it's even more intimate or just 

968
00:42:01,901 --> 00:42:01,901
walking or it's basically your app,
you know,

969
00:42:01,901 --> 00:42:04,430
you have to keep,
you have to be vigilant about it because

970
00:42:04,431 --> 00:42:09,431
like,
if somebody just decides this is what 

971
00:42:09,431 --> 00:42:09,431
I'm going to do and we're all vulnerable
to Greece.

972
00:42:09,431 --> 00:42:11,510
Some guy decides to take out an AK 47 or
drive his car into a group.

973
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,220
We're all just sitting ducks,
you know,

974
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:17,300
and all the preparation in the world,
you can't fight a gun with your fist.

975
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:22,190
You can't outweigh a man with your body 
mass as a woman was a real big girl.

976
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,470
And uh,
you know,

977
00:42:24,471 --> 00:42:26,360
I don't know.
I think about those things.

978
00:42:26,361 --> 00:42:29,150
And so that's why it's tough when you're
walking in,

979
00:42:29,151 --> 00:42:30,950
you're a girl and some guys like smile.
You're like,

980
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,530
I'm just trying to fucking survive.
Forget the smile thing.

981
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:36,990
That's such a bully move.
Because those guys who do that,

982
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,540
they're only doing that because they're 
bigger and stronger than you.

983
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,890
Oh,
and by the way,

984
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,010
smiling causes wrinkles.
Wrinkles.

985
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,570
What if you have done like,
can't even smile.

986
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,670
I don't know about that.
But if you like,

987
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,400
the reason why a guy will do that is 
because he can like,

988
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,530
a guy's not going to do that to a bigger
man.

989
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,180
You know what I'm saying?
Like a bigger man walks by,

990
00:42:54,181 --> 00:42:54,870
hey,
smile.

991
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,530
Hey,
fuck.

992
00:42:55,610 --> 00:43:00,610
You know what I'm saying?
Like you're ordering someone to do 

993
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:00,630
something.
But moreover

994
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:06,240
I'm just trying to.
I'm putting on a face just saying I 

995
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,640
don't want to be bothered because I'm 
scared and I'm trying to get from point 

996
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,870
a to point B and you're praying on that 
vulnerability thinking that I want that.

997
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:12,610
If I want to see your Dick,
I'll tell you,

998
00:43:12,611 --> 00:43:13,680
if I want to talk to you,
I'll look.

999
00:43:13,681 --> 00:43:13,730
Yeah,

1000
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:18,820
you're not thinking that you want that.
What they're doing is they're realizing 

1001
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:18,890
that you don't want to have anything to 
do with them.

1002
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:22,490
And by saying that they have this power 
to affect you,

1003
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:27,580
well,
what scary watch smile wouldn't look 

1004
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:27,580
like such a bitch.
Right?

1005
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:31,810
And what's scary is then if you don't,
I don't know what wrath that's going to 

1006
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:36,371
incur when I say fuck off,
I better put them on the other side of 

1007
00:43:36,371 --> 00:43:36,480
the street.
Yeah.

1008
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:41,940
And what's funny,
because I and I talked about it in the 

1009
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:41,940
specialist,
I'm not trying to do a bit.

1010
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:45,430
This is such a common conversation.
We have this thing where a guy says 

1011
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:45,430
something to him who sweetheart,
and you're like,

1012
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:46,460
fuck off,
and you get tough.

1013
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,260
Immediately followed by what if he kills
me?

1014
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,880
It's always our thought like,
oh my God,

1015
00:43:49,881 --> 00:43:51,260
please don't,
don't follow me.

1016
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:51,950
Oh,
of course.

1017
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,470
We came out of this show last night,
this girl's night in show,

1018
00:43:55,471 --> 00:43:57,320
and everybody was feeling great.
We walk outside and it's like,

1019
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:59,810
dude walks up,
boat to go to the loader.

1020
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:03,320
You're walking into a group of five 
girls having a lively conversation.

1021
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:06,290
You put yourself in the middle and I 
walked where I go ill,

1022
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:08,690
I'm not doing that.
And he like started chirping at me.

1023
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:13,990
What's your problem?
Who was a lawyer and my fucking dumb 

1024
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:13,990
friends like I think I do sir,
and I'm like,

1025
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:16,190
this is not the time to demonstrate how 
compassionate you are.

1026
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,170
Fuck,
don't give him a lighter.

1027
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:21,470
Like there's no reason to go anywhere 
else.

1028
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:22,670
You're obviously a crazy person,

1029
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:25,530
but that's another incidence.
Where are instance where other,

1030
00:44:25,531 --> 00:44:28,940
where a guy will do that because he's 
bigger because he can get away with.

1031
00:44:28,941 --> 00:44:30,910
That guy's not going to do that to a 
group of guys know.

1032
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,540
You know what I mean?
That's this.

1033
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:37,670
The reason why he's doing it,
he's doing it because he's as imposing 

1034
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:37,670
like he's a big dog walking to a room

1035
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:42,640
in this and sometimes you know,
for shows like I have security 

1036
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,320
thereafter and it's not,
you know,

1037
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,510
not beyond say it's not like people are 
throwing themselves at me,

1038
00:44:45,511 --> 00:44:50,511
but I found just having a large man,
even if it's a friend of mine standing 

1039
00:44:50,761 --> 00:44:52,530
next to me,
detours,

1040
00:44:52,531 --> 00:44:57,531
even the beginnings of even the inklings
of a let me step to her and see what's 

1041
00:44:57,531 --> 00:44:58,650
going to happen just for having one 
there.

1042
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:03,670
Well,
that's got to be a thing with girls 

1043
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:04,310
that's different with like God.
People get obsessed with people.

1044
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:06,530
Guys get obsessed with girls,
girls get obsessed with guys.

1045
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:12,220
There's a lot of people out there that 
are unstable and they lock onto someone 

1046
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:12,220
that get obsessed with them.
Sure.

1047
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,990
But if a man gets obsessed with you 
sexually,

1048
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,940
that becomes a giant issue

1049
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:22,210
and there is no separation by the way.
You can't just be obsessed with me 

1050
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:22,210
because you're like,
oh,

1051
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:23,330
I just,
she was brilliant and I'm totally normal

1052
00:45:23,331 --> 00:45:25,850
like relationship with you.
Right.

1053
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,180
Had that happen.
I had a stalker.

1054
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:32,810
It was a couple of years ago.
And um,

1055
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:36,950
I did a show in Michigan.
Was it Michigan?

1056
00:45:36,951 --> 00:45:41,951
Nope.
I was university of Delaware and I was 

1057
00:45:41,951 --> 00:45:41,951
going to Michigan the next day.
And,

1058
00:45:41,951 --> 00:45:44,250
and the idea of college obviously,
and the woman working there,

1059
00:45:44,251 --> 00:45:45,020
she comes up to me,
she goes,

1060
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:45,980
hey,
there's a guy here.

1061
00:45:45,981 --> 00:45:46,820
He says,
where's your cousin?

1062
00:45:46,821 --> 00:45:48,500
And I was like,
I don't have a cousin in Delaware.

1063
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,000
So she leaves,
she comes back,

1064
00:45:50,001 --> 00:45:52,610
she goes,
he says he's a comic from La.

1065
00:45:52,611 --> 00:45:57,611
And I'm like,
I don't know any comes from Delaware 

1066
00:45:57,611 --> 00:45:57,611
also.
And then she leaves,

1067
00:45:57,611 --> 00:45:57,611
she comes back,
she goes,

1068
00:45:57,611 --> 00:45:57,611
he says,
I go,

1069
00:45:57,611 --> 00:45:58,910
stop,
stop coming back to me.

1070
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:04,210
This is obviously like several attempts 
and now security has to walk me out to 

1071
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:05,120
the car.
So we do that.

1072
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:07,940
And so I had it kind of in my mind like 
somebody did something.

1073
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:10,340
So I've go to Michigan and I'm in 
Michigan,

1074
00:46:10,341 --> 00:46:13,490
I'm there for a festival the next day 
and the secure.

1075
00:46:13,491 --> 00:46:15,470
And I mentioned it.
It just kind of mentioned.

1076
00:46:15,471 --> 00:46:17,420
I was like,
this happened yesterday and the security

1077
00:46:17,421 --> 00:46:18,440
guard comes over.
And he was like,

1078
00:46:18,441 --> 00:46:23,441
yeah,
there was a guy waiting in the hallway 

1079
00:46:23,441 --> 00:46:25,511
after we cleared it.
And when I talked to him he kind of ran 

1080
00:46:25,511 --> 00:46:26,750
away and I kind of got his name.
I think he likes his ID for a second.

1081
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:31,751
The guy was like trying to get in,
but he was creepy enough that security 

1082
00:46:31,751 --> 00:46:35,290
like caught it.
So they showed me the surveillance 

1083
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:37,661
tapes,
you see nothing but a grainy face and 

1084
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:38,450
like a black leather jacket and what 
they thought his name was.

1085
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:42,170
So a couple of weeks later I had,
I was going to play south by southwest,

1086
00:46:42,171 --> 00:46:45,830
so I told my manager about it,
so she tells security there,

1087
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:47,410
my buddy,
I'm not gonna,

1088
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:52,430
say his name because he's very shy,
is ex army ranger and works for the 

1089
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:58,240
contracts with the government and so I 
told him so he called the FBI and they 

1090
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,771
gave him with just the grainy photo and 
what we thought his name was and they 

1091
00:47:02,771 --> 00:47:05,960
found who he was,
just some nut who of course has guns and

1092
00:47:05,961 --> 00:47:10,430
has a record and lives off his family 
money somewhere in rural whatever.

1093
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:16,270
And I was at south by southwest and I 
had given and I felt bad and this goes 

1094
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:17,960
to women feeling bad for taking up 
space.

1095
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,330
There were way more famous people there 
than me.

1096
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,490
But here I am.
I can't pick up my badge.

1097
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:25,220
I had to go talk to the police.
Like I had to have an escort everywhere.

1098
00:47:25,221 --> 00:47:27,350
I'm doing like a bar show,
you know,

1099
00:47:27,351 --> 00:47:32,351
I'm just there to hang out with my 
friends and I had to have to all three 

1100
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:32,351
shows

1101
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:35,730
and I felt embarrassed because I have 
this police escort and like huge movie 

1102
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:38,350
stars are there and they don't even have
that and I didn't want anyone to look at

1103
00:47:38,351 --> 00:47:43,351
me like who does she think she is?
But I was scared and he had and so it 

1104
00:47:43,351 --> 00:47:47,461
was the last show and I thought it was 
in the clear and I go and I do my set 

1105
00:47:47,461 --> 00:47:48,220
and one of the cops comes over.
They were like,

1106
00:47:48,221 --> 00:47:53,221
he showed up and we caught him,
but had they not been there and they 

1107
00:47:53,221 --> 00:47:57,541
talked to them and I guess they put the 
fear of God in him because they were 

1108
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:57,541
like,
she doesn't want to talk to you.

1109
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:57,541
And he goes,
oh,

1110
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:02,221
I don't want to hurt her.
And I'm thinking your version of hurt 

1111
00:48:02,221 --> 00:48:03,370
and mine are very different.
Like I need my skin.

1112
00:48:03,371 --> 00:48:05,170
You probably don't think it hurts to 
take it off of me.

1113
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:07,930
How about you don't want to talk to him,
period.

1114
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:11,230
Like he didn't want to hurt her,
but I need to talk to her.

1115
00:48:11,231 --> 00:48:12,000
Look,
you never need,

1116
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,620
you don't need that.
And it's Texas cops so they love,

1117
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:20,730
they get super hard for you in the 
fucking desert and they scared them off 

1118
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:24,331
and I've never had to deal with him.
But for months at the Improv at the 

1119
00:48:24,331 --> 00:48:24,331
customer,
we had this guy's picture up,

1120
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,320
Jesus Christ and I did nothing.
You know,

1121
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:29,020
it's just,
you decide like he goes,

1122
00:48:29,021 --> 00:48:31,960
she's communicates with me through 
meditation and Kabbalah.

1123
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:33,580
I was like,
all right,

1124
00:48:33,581 --> 00:48:36,500
let them in Jewish meditation.
No,

1125
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,590
I think a Madonna was doing that for 
awhile.

1126
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:43,620
Jewish mysticism wasn't madonna like she
was into which all these people that are

1127
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:49,171
like kabbalists that have studied it 
forever and she's trying to like hack 

1128
00:48:49,171 --> 00:48:49,900
it.
She is Madonna.

1129
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:53,110
She gets a velvet rope to the front of 
the line.

1130
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,910
That was Janet Jackson's tore the velvet
rope tour.

1131
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:56,860
Thought you're making like a pop 
reference.

1132
00:48:56,890 --> 00:49:00,220
No.
Saying like she gets VIP to the Kabbalah

1133
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:01,270
Center.
Registering in the water.

1134
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,580
What is Caballo like w,
what do you know?

1135
00:49:03,581 --> 00:49:06,730
Anything about the study of Jewish 
mysticism.

1136
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,390
So Judaism is actually a very ancient 
sort of mystical,

1137
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:15,420
spiritual religion and this Kinda goes 
sort of back to its roots and its 

1138
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:18,300
something that you can't because I've 
always been interested in,

1139
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:21,580
you can't just pick up a book,
like it's a lot of studying,

1140
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,120
a lot of like deep seated,
dissecting Hebrew numbers,

1141
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:30,180
you know,
it's not something you just decide 

1142
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,731
you're going to do,
but I don't know much about it other 

1143
00:49:32,731 --> 00:49:33,660
than it from ancient Hebrew.
Ancient like it's.

1144
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,360
Yeah,
it's,

1145
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,450
yeah,
it's weird language.

1146
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:42,690
I would love to go.
It's like I love looking at old 

1147
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:45,781
languages because you're looking at like
some weird art form and that way it was 

1148
00:49:45,781 --> 00:49:47,320
the first forms of communication.

1149
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,790
Like if you look at it,
you know,

1150
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:52,840
ancient Hebrew or ancient Arabic or 
Aramaic or something like that.

1151
00:49:52,841 --> 00:49:57,841
Like the,
just the way those things are 

1152
00:49:57,841 --> 00:49:59,251
structured,
the way the sentence is written out of 

1153
00:49:59,251 --> 00:49:59,251
this.
Um,

1154
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:03,640
it's several hundred years old,
but it's a Thai Bible.

1155
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,620
Ooh.
And it's on my wall,

1156
00:50:05,621 --> 00:50:07,960
like I have.
It's written on these,

1157
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:13,040
um,
palm the palm would and flattened it out

1158
00:50:13,391 --> 00:50:16,690
and painted it.
So it's like this really like artistic,

1159
00:50:16,691 --> 00:50:19,620
weird thing that's framed,
but I just go buy it.

1160
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:20,500
I look at it,
I'm like,

1161
00:50:20,501 --> 00:50:22,630
this is like I have no idea what the 
fuck it says,

1162
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,030
but it's just cool to look at.
Sure.

1163
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:30,390
Weird way of of writing and 
communicating these people had was also 

1164
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:33,821
fascinating because like they had the 
urge that we do to record everything.

1165
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,140
People are going to look at ours in a 
million years and be like,

1166
00:50:36,141 --> 00:50:37,820
why are there all these eggplant emojis?

1167
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,580
Why does everything have eggplant and 
squirting water?

1168
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,970
Why is everyone yellow?
But they had to say,

1169
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,280
I always wonder,
did they have.

1170
00:50:46,281 --> 00:50:47,960
I mean obviously they didn't have the 
same advancements,

1171
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:52,961
but like ancient Greece,
like did they have like what were young 

1172
00:50:52,961 --> 00:50:53,240
people doing?
Like was it,

1173
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:56,630
what was your fun besides vomiting?
Couldn't vomitorium in wrestling?

1174
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:02,280
Yeah.
Well I would just love to be a fly on 

1175
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:02,280
the wall back then.
I mean,

1176
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,160
when you're talking about people that 
had very little understanding of how the

1177
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:07,850
universe worked or the rudimentary 
understanding of science,

1178
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:13,030
just to hear the wisest the wise amongst
them and try to figure out what makes 

1179
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:14,720
everything tick.
Talking about how acne is the devil.

1180
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,540
We want to talk about how women were 
treated.

1181
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:20,900
Then that's what's really weird.
It's like women have always been treated

1182
00:51:20,901 --> 00:51:25,901
like shit always.
It's always been some weird sort of 

1183
00:51:25,901 --> 00:51:27,170
relationship between men and women 
because we can get away with it.

1184
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,330
That's really the bottom line about at 
all.

1185
00:51:29,331 --> 00:51:34,331
It's like what's happening today I think
is that because of the ability to 

1186
00:51:35,691 --> 00:51:40,691
express now,
like it's almost like something could 

1187
00:51:40,691 --> 00:51:44,030
happen to you in a bad way and no one 
could know about it.

1188
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:49,120
Right?
But now everyone can know about it if 

1189
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:49,120
you express it.
If you express it,

1190
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,510
everyone can know about it.
Everyone can know.

1191
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,440
Sure.
And now everybody's realizing that and 

1192
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,490
there's like a shift where everybody's.
It's like when black lives matter really

1193
00:51:58,491 --> 00:51:59,630
came to the forefront,
you know?

1194
00:51:59,631 --> 00:52:01,340
And all these white people are like,
oh my God,

1195
00:52:01,341 --> 00:52:03,380
I didn't realize America was racist and 
black people are like,

1196
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:04,820
really?
Because we did.

1197
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,890
So all these women now are like,
yeah,

1198
00:52:06,891 --> 00:52:10,670
this shit goes on all the time.
And I even think about in comedy,

1199
00:52:10,671 --> 00:52:15,671
you know,
and I went on a twitter rant the other 

1200
00:52:15,671 --> 00:52:15,671
day about it,
this idea,

1201
00:52:15,671 --> 00:52:19,550
it's an art comedy as art and people 
feel ownership over it.

1202
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:21,380
So you get these boys clubs,
you know,

1203
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:23,990
I'm very lucky in that I,
you know,

1204
00:52:23,991 --> 00:52:28,991
like you get like it's a group of dudes 
that run the show and they don't like 

1205
00:52:28,991 --> 00:52:31,961
girls,
whatever it is or the way a lot of guys 

1206
00:52:31,961 --> 00:52:34,271
make women feel and it's so insane.
I'm like so because you moved to La a 

1207
00:52:34,271 --> 00:52:36,560
year before me and you and your friends 
wrote the same jerk-off jokes.

1208
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,600
You somehow think you own this art form 
that I've always felt a connection to it

1209
00:52:40,601 --> 00:52:43,320
my whole life.
Just because you remember it.

1210
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:45,530
Because I would.
Not only that,

1211
00:52:45,531 --> 00:52:47,150
I mean,
I don't mean you get it,

1212
00:52:47,151 --> 00:52:48,350
like do you understand it?
But I mean,

1213
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:50,140
does it happen to me as it happened to,
you know,

1214
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,650
and the truth is I was able to avoid it 
because of what I did in my career early

1215
00:52:54,651 --> 00:52:58,220
on because like winning a show like that
makes you,

1216
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:01,730
you get to headline.
So I was never respected.

1217
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:06,970
It's not even that as much as I just was
never in the trenches as much because I 

1218
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:08,040
got to headline,
which is always the goal.

1219
00:53:08,041 --> 00:53:10,310
Like I just had a different path.
How much,

1220
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:15,610
how much?
How many years were you doing standup 

1221
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:15,610
before you?
One last comic standing.

1222
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:15,610
Whoa,
that's crazy.

1223
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:17,360
Right?
So for me,

1224
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:20,630
I'm even more firmly,
I guess planted in my,

1225
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:26,160
in my convictions about sympathizing or 
empathizing with women who didn't

1226
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,400
have the same advantage and I want to 
just,

1227
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:30,860
or anyone being bullied,
but I've see it,

1228
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:32,730
you know,
at clubs that we do.

1229
00:53:32,731 --> 00:53:34,290
And these are my home clubs and I love 
it.

1230
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,290
Coming up the last 10 years I've 
watched.

1231
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:38,700
Oh no,
he's a good guy.

1232
00:53:38,701 --> 00:53:43,701
And this guy cyst like systematically,
like daily harasses women and all the 

1233
00:53:43,701 --> 00:53:44,010
guys like,
no,

1234
00:53:44,011 --> 00:53:45,180
he's cool.
He's front,

1235
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:46,740
we're friends with him,
you know,

1236
00:53:46,741 --> 00:53:48,420
it's like you've seen the.
I've seen that.

1237
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:50,880
I'm not gonna say names,
but there are people who go out of their

1238
00:53:50,881 --> 00:53:55,881
way to be horrific and I never see the 
guys around us and these are all 

1239
00:53:55,881 --> 00:53:58,350
contemporaries say anything because it's
like now he's a good guy.

1240
00:53:58,351 --> 00:54:03,120
He's our friend and women will dm me.
Female comics will send me messages.

1241
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,730
This is happening to me.
He said this to me,

1242
00:54:05,731 --> 00:54:06,930
what do I do?
And I'm like,

1243
00:54:06,931 --> 00:54:11,931
Oh,
you can do is be kind work on your 

1244
00:54:11,931 --> 00:54:11,931
jokes.
Fuck that guy doesn't mean anything,

1245
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:13,110
but it is a thing.

1246
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:18,210
Does mean something psychologically.
If you have to go to the club and then 

1247
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:18,890
you see that guy and if you see him 
right before you have a set.

1248
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:19,930
Oh my God,
yeah.

1249
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,340
Oh my God.
I've had,

1250
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:22,720
you know,
disagreements.

1251
00:54:22,721 --> 00:54:24,780
I was nervous.
This isn't you.

1252
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,240
When I,
when you and I had the,

1253
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,420
the thing about your phone number,
I was like,

1254
00:54:28,421 --> 00:54:30,580
I don't want to run into Joe.
I'm so afraid of Joe.

1255
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,950
And that's someone who's a friend of 
mine.

1256
00:54:32,951 --> 00:54:34,960
You know,
it's already such a weird thing to go to

1257
00:54:34,961 --> 00:54:36,760
work,
but the girls who were like,

1258
00:54:36,761 --> 00:54:37,440
oh yeah,
I,

1259
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:40,030
he told me I wasn't funny.
He told me I was a slut.

1260
00:54:40,031 --> 00:54:41,790
He told me this,
he told me I was to x,

1261
00:54:41,791 --> 00:54:46,791
Y,
Z to this and just as if the guy owns 

1262
00:54:46,791 --> 00:54:49,951
the art form,
when what breaks my heart is like real 

1263
00:54:49,951 --> 00:54:53,221
comics,
like you are like Sebastian or like 

1264
00:54:53,221 --> 00:54:56,071
people that I or Mark Mayer and like 
guys that I look up to that I think are 

1265
00:54:56,071 --> 00:54:58,891
so brilliant,
they don't have time to sit there and 

1266
00:54:58,891 --> 00:54:59,890
get in the head of some girl who's just 
trying to make 15 bucks.

1267
00:54:59,891 --> 00:55:01,660
You know,
it's not your emo.

1268
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:03,030
It's only loser.

1269
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:06,960
Well,
I always feel that we're all in the same

1270
00:55:06,961 --> 00:55:10,590
boat together and that if you have a 
vagina and I have a penis,

1271
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:12,510
it doesn't.
We're all comics.

1272
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,940
Like I think the really.
I mean that's got.

1273
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:20,080
It sounds like even to be sincere sounds
like such horseshit and this weird day 

1274
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,140
and age because you feel like you're 
trying to cover up and try.

1275
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:23,520
I'm not those guys.
Hey,

1276
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:26,490
I'm not that Harvey Weinstein Guy.
I'm different.

1277
00:55:26,491 --> 00:55:28,140
I'm going to come with me.
Yeah,

1278
00:55:28,141 --> 00:55:29,950
I'm a sweetie.
We could sleep on the couch together.

1279
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:33,360
I wouldn't even bother me.
But you know what I mean,

1280
00:55:33,361 --> 00:55:37,530
like there's.
But I think it's very important that all

1281
00:55:37,531 --> 00:55:40,560
of us that work together,
look,

1282
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:42,720
I could learn shit from comedy,
but from you,

1283
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,140
I can learn shit from anybody.
I mean,

1284
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,970
I've seen people do do standup.
They've seen me do stand up.

1285
00:55:50,971 --> 00:55:53,130
They do it different than me.
We talk.

1286
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:55,340
You've got a different method than I do 
there.

1287
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:57,390
There might be something you see,
it's always,

1288
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:01,230
we're all peers and we're pairs,
but you,

1289
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:06,470
I feel like that with friends and I feel
like that with peers in a field like 

1290
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:06,470
that.
Within it,

1291
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:11,090
you gotta you gotta be open and if 
you're not open you're going to miss 

1292
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:11,160
stuff.

1293
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:15,820
You're also very secure and I really do 
believe that insecurity,

1294
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:17,830
whether you're a woman hating another 
woman,

1295
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:20,410
whether you're a dude trying to like 
step to another guy,

1296
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:25,440
it all comes from insecurity.
So when you're run the show with my 

1297
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,290
buddies or you know,
I've been doing it three years,

1298
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:28,180
I'm old the world,
like you're told that you're,

1299
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:29,330
that you're owed more,
right?

1300
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:30,850
Or concrete job.
I should have more.

1301
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:36,210
It comes from this insecurity of if she 
gets something that I deserve and it 

1302
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:37,450
comes from this place of you think you 
deserve something.

1303
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,920
Um,
and that was a big thing for me after I 

1304
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,061
did the show.
The men that I had to tour with were 

1305
00:56:45,061 --> 00:56:45,670
horrific,
like mental scars,

1306
00:56:45,671 --> 00:56:48,400
indelible marks on my brain,
horrific.

1307
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:51,520
Because there was this entitlement like 
how dare she take that,

1308
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:52,750
you know,
how dare you,

1309
00:56:52,751 --> 00:56:55,090
when the show,
how dare you not roll over and die.

1310
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:59,950
But so I see that and I don't have to 
deal with it as much.

1311
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,420
Um,
but I,

1312
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:04,540
my heart breaks because I wish that 
these girls five years later could look,

1313
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:07,450
could realize from like a bird's eye 
view when it's happening.

1314
00:57:07,451 --> 00:57:08,710
I'm like,
that guy's got nothing.

1315
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,190
Like if you really are going to be that 
mean to a fellow comic,

1316
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:12,950
you obviously hate

1317
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:15,040
yourself so much,
but you don't see that.

1318
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:16,750
Like I wouldn't see that if somebody 
hated me,

1319
00:57:16,751 --> 00:57:18,970
even if there were a loser.
When someone hates you,

1320
00:57:18,971 --> 00:57:19,590
it sucks.
No,

1321
00:57:19,591 --> 00:57:20,320
no.
Hate yourself.

1322
00:57:20,321 --> 00:57:25,321
Hates them.
Like if you're gonna have someone hates 

1323
00:57:25,321 --> 00:57:25,321
on you because they saw themselves as 
still.

1324
00:57:25,321 --> 00:57:25,321
Sorry.

1325
00:57:25,321 --> 00:57:29,350
I had a guy when I started I was doing 
these like comedy contest and like 

1326
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:30,110
Orange County,
which were a total racket,

1327
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:35,620
but I don't even know the guy.
I think he was another comic and he was 

1328
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:38,621
like a middle aged dad and he would on a
weekly basis write me hate email calling

1329
00:57:39,741 --> 00:57:41,420
me names that I had never been called in
my.

1330
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:44,690
I was like 23 or something.
You were fucking bitch,

1331
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:48,490
like just railing on me and I didn't 
like someone jerking off very.

1332
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:53,520
You don't know how to handle that.
No one I've ever even had a woman be 

1333
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:53,840
that mean to me.
And so I,

1334
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:59,230
I took it.
I wrote back a couple times like what's 

1335
00:57:59,230 --> 00:57:59,230
your problem?
And it was just,

1336
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:02,741
he was just a crazy person firing off at
someone and a year later he wrote me an 

1337
00:58:02,811 --> 00:58:04,340
email to be like,
I'm in Rehab now.

1338
00:58:04,341 --> 00:58:06,260
I'm so sorry,
I've got a wife,

1339
00:58:06,261 --> 00:58:09,770
I've got kids,
so you enter into this art form and into

1340
00:58:09,771 --> 00:58:14,771
the city with the best of intentions,
trying to keep your soul as clean as 

1341
00:58:14,771 --> 00:58:18,761
possible and you have no control over 
the crazy that's going to be in your 

1342
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:19,850
path.
You only have control over how you heal

1343
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:25,260
I guess,
and I think every comic is crazy in a 

1344
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:25,860
certain way.
There's just no way around it.

1345
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:30,930
If you're funny.
I've never met a single funny one that 

1346
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:30,940
wasn't fucking crazy.
They're all crazy.

1347
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:33,160
It's just everyone's crazy as a 
different.

1348
00:58:33,161 --> 00:58:33,670
Crazy.

1349
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:38,780
Well here's the other side of it.
So you get women and and my whole thing 

1350
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:43,191
is like,
you should be fired from your job for 

1351
00:58:43,191 --> 00:58:45,411
not being funny.
Not because you didn't like fuck 

1352
00:58:45,411 --> 00:58:45,411
someone.
Right.

1353
00:58:45,411 --> 00:58:45,480
But I think some people take it a step 
further.

1354
00:58:45,481 --> 00:58:46,740
They're like more for women and I'm 
like,

1355
00:58:46,741 --> 00:58:46,890
no,
no,

1356
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,860
no.
Do the jokes be funny.

1357
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,110
You shouldn't get the gauges because 
you're a girl.

1358
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:55,140
You should get a chance and you should 
have a chance to prove yourself.

1359
00:58:55,141 --> 00:58:58,770
And not everyone's standing in the way,
but this like more women in comedy.

1360
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:00,750
Right?
The jokes be fucking funny.

1361
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:03,210
I will.
I will fight for you to get that chance,

1362
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:04,500
but I'm not going to hire you

1363
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:07,760
a woman.
The more women in comedy thing is like,

1364
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,700
I just want humans to be good at it.
I want good,

1365
00:59:10,701 --> 00:59:14,360
funny people and I think there are more 
women in comedy now than ever before.

1366
00:59:14,361 --> 00:59:16,940
But I think there's more people in 
comedy now than ever before.

1367
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:18,920
So saturated.
It's so saturated.

1368
00:59:18,921 --> 00:59:20,810
But I think it's a good thing.
There's a lot of.

1369
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:26,500
And there's a lot of support.
Like one of the things that bothers me 

1370
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,910
the most about any sort of weird shit 
that goes on with Comedians,

1371
00:59:28,911 --> 00:59:31,400
whether it's boy,
Girl Shit or anything else,

1372
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:36,730
is that there is a comradery that we 
share that is very unusual in a fairly 

1373
00:59:38,001 --> 00:59:43,001
competitive art form.
Competitive in that I don't think it's 

1374
00:59:43,001 --> 00:59:46,811
as competitive anymore.
And what I mean by this is that I don't 

1375
00:59:46,811 --> 00:59:50,021
think that the idea of like getting a 
sitcom or being the host of the tonight 

1376
00:59:50,021 --> 00:59:51,050
show or you know,
these,

1377
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:53,450
these limited number of gigs that are 
available,

1378
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:55,340
I don't think that's where it's at 
anymore.

1379
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:00,520
I think there's more people like you 
that are doing netflix specials in me 

1380
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:04,120
and we both do podcasts.
Like that kind of thing I think is way 

1381
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:07,751
more open to people and it's way easier 
for us to all to be supportive of each 

1382
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:11,300
other and supportive of each other in 
the art form of standup.

1383
01:00:11,301 --> 01:00:14,270
Like what's important in our world is 
don't steal.

1384
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:16,680
Don't be an asshole to your fellow 
comedian.

1385
01:00:16,681 --> 01:00:19,730
Support each other and I'm going to be 
there for you if you're there.

1386
01:00:19,731 --> 01:00:20,180
For me.

1387
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,370
I think there's two things to that.
I agree.

1388
01:00:23,371 --> 01:00:26,580
I think it's also easier to be 
supportive when someone's undeniable.

1389
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,520
I think when you're first starting out 
and when you're kind of in the clubs and

1390
01:00:29,521 --> 01:00:34,521
you're all kind of fighting for to 
figure out what you have when someone's 

1391
01:00:34,521 --> 01:00:35,520
genuinely funny man or a woman,
I'm the first one to be like,

1392
01:00:35,521 --> 01:00:36,600
yes,
love that.

1393
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:41,650
Like I visibly fell over subash and when
I bring them on stage and I'm sure he 

1394
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:41,760
like,
doesn't love it,

1395
01:00:41,761 --> 01:00:42,700
but I'm like,
he's the.

1396
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:45,450
And,
and you are.

1397
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:46,740
I mean,
this sounds like a,

1398
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,930
like I'm stroking your ego,
but it's true.

1399
01:00:48,931 --> 01:00:53,931
Like you single handedly,
I think change the sort of landscape in 

1400
01:00:53,931 --> 01:00:58,191
the way that we consume comedy.
Like you have this massive podcast.

1401
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:03,500
You guys don't know.
We're in a studio that is at least 2 

1402
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:03,720
million square feet and there aren't 
stuffed animals everywhere.

1403
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:08,720
Like what ones were not teddy bears.
And there's elk horns and there's an 

1404
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:09,210
interactive dinosaur exhibit.
Like it's huge.

1405
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:11,850
Um,
he's like a monster drink fountain.

1406
01:01:11,851 --> 01:01:14,670
It's crazy.
But you know,

1407
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:17,340
having this podcast and then people see 
what's possible.

1408
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:22,341
So what's funny is you did this and you 
built this sort of podcast empire and 

1409
01:01:22,341 --> 01:01:26,481
there's other big ones too.
But this is definitely one of the most 

1410
01:01:26,481 --> 01:01:30,051
consumed on the planet,
so then it sort of opens up this new 

1411
01:01:30,051 --> 01:01:32,751
avenues and then you get all these other
comics on do podcasts too and not 

1412
01:01:32,751 --> 01:01:33,570
everybody's equipped to do it and there 
is,

1413
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:39,080
I think a glory and being one of the 
originals because you kind of paved the 

1414
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:39,080
way

1415
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,560
and imitators fucked up a lot in the 
beginning and got better at it.

1416
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:45,010
And I was having a conversation with a 
good buddy of mine this morning about it

1417
01:01:45,011 --> 01:01:47,620
and he was asking me about 
conversations.

1418
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:51,250
We were just talking about conversations
about letting figure there's like an art

1419
01:01:51,251 --> 01:01:56,251
form to letting people talk in a way 
that's easy to consume for the people 

1420
01:01:56,251 --> 01:01:56,251
that are listening.

1421
01:01:56,251 --> 01:02:00,680
We are very good listener and I think a 
lot of when I started my podcast I did 

1422
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:01,660
it so I could work on my listening 
skills.

1423
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,490
I know you were.
And that was so nice.

1424
01:02:03,491 --> 01:02:05,530
Talk about support and you did not have 
to do that.

1425
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:07,480
Um,
and I think,

1426
01:02:07,481 --> 01:02:11,020
and I don't do a lot of podcasts,
I begged to do yours.

1427
01:02:11,021 --> 01:02:12,160
So it's not like you asked me and I was 
like,

1428
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:14,650
I'm busy Joe,
but I don't do a lot of them because not

1429
01:02:14,651 --> 01:02:16,900
every comic is a good listener or 
equipped.

1430
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:22,010
Well,
we were talking about before the show 

1431
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:22,010
started about some interviews you've 
done,

1432
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:22,010
you know,
and there's,

1433
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:26,230
there's always going to beat it.
It's like you got to want to talk to 

1434
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:26,230
people.
I like.

1435
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:30,120
I like talking to people like this is 
one of the reasons why podcast is a good

1436
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:34,590
fit for me is because I'm curious.
You're very curious,

1437
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:37,680
very curious.
I like talking to people.

1438
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:41,280
I want to.
Like when I was saying like would I be a

1439
01:02:41,281 --> 01:02:46,281
woman for a day?
I want to know how the fuck your brain 

1440
01:02:46,281 --> 01:02:46,281
works.
I know,

1441
01:02:46,281 --> 01:02:49,080
I know you don't know how mine works and
I know I don't know how your works.

1442
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:54,140
I'm fascinated and I think that we try 
to figure men and women try to figure 

1443
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:58,611
out our interactions with each other 
through trial and error and when sexual 

1444
01:02:58,611 --> 01:02:59,190
harassment and sexual assault and stuff 
like this,

1445
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:01,440
what's coming out in the news with 
Harvey Weinstein and,

1446
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:04,200
and others.
And even the Kevin Spacey stuff,

1447
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:09,530
what we're starting to see Kevin Spacey 
stuff not very applicable to what I'm 

1448
01:03:09,530 --> 01:03:10,980
talking about because it's men doing it 
to men,

1449
01:03:10,981 --> 01:03:15,981
but the Harvey Weinstein thing is it's 
like here's someone who's not even 

1450
01:03:15,981 --> 01:03:17,280
trying to think about how women think.

1451
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:19,290
Not only that,
he was trying to think,

1452
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:21,580
how can I,
how can I do this the most?

1453
01:03:21,581 --> 01:03:24,540
He had like a network of people helping 
him exact that plan.

1454
01:03:24,541 --> 01:03:25,560
This wasn't like,
I'm drunk.

1455
01:03:25,561 --> 01:03:30,561
Touch my Dick.
This was my assistant's going to score 

1456
01:03:30,561 --> 01:03:30,561
it.
You Lynn.

1457
01:03:30,561 --> 01:03:30,570
I'm going to send spies to try to cover 
this up later.

1458
01:03:30,571 --> 01:03:35,571
Like it's maniacal.
Did you ever see that article from 1945 

1459
01:03:35,571 --> 01:03:37,260
with a.
What was that woman's name?

1460
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:40,270
I'll send it to you again.
Jamie Loreano her.

1461
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:44,100
That was like,
if this is Hollywood crazy,

1462
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:46,020
Jamie,
I'm going to send it to you again.

1463
01:03:46,021 --> 01:03:47,700
Put this up on the,
on the big screen.

1464
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:52,960
You know,
I got a better version of it where it's 

1465
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:52,960
not cutoff.
Hollywood is probably like,

1466
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:52,960
yeah,
goodbye.

1467
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:57,020
Yeah,
this is 1945 til she was complaining 

1468
01:03:57,020 --> 01:04:01,220
that people were trying to fuck her all 
the time and she couldn't get any work 

1469
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:01,220
because they said she was cold.

1470
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:05,150
She was like,
in order to get work I have to like 

1471
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:08,180
leave my husband,
get rid of my kids and be just fuckable 

1472
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:08,910
here.
Does Irish film star Maureen O'hara,

1473
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:13,920
sorry.
Today charge Hollywood producers and 

1474
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:14,400
directors of calling her a cold potato 
without sex appeal tonight.

1475
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:19,710
Potato refuses to let them make love to 
her.

1476
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:23,220
Says the mere in New York correspondent.
Can I read it in her Irish accent?

1477
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:26,580
I'm so upset with us that I'm ready to 
quit.

1478
01:04:26,581 --> 01:04:29,220
Hollywood marine says it's gotten so 
bad.

1479
01:04:29,221 --> 01:04:31,650
I hate to come to work in the morning.
I'm helpless.

1480
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:36,720
A helpless victim of a Hollywood 
whispering campaign because I don't let 

1481
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,340
the producer and director kiss me every 
morning or tell them or let them,

1482
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:41,820
Paul me and have them spread the words 
around town that I'm not a woman,

1483
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,130
that I have a cold piece of marble 
statuary.

1484
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:45,410
Statuary could word.

1485
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:50,560
I guess Hollywood won't consider me as 
anything except a cold hunka marble 

1486
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:52,350
until I divorced my husband.
My husband gave me baby away and take my

1487
01:04:52,351 --> 01:04:54,360
name and photograph on all the newest 
papers.

1488
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:56,370
If that's Hollywood's idea of being a 
woman,

1489
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:58,490
I'm ready to quit.
No crazy.

1490
01:04:58,680 --> 01:04:59,640
How good my accident is.
Yeah,

1491
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:02,220
it's very good,
but 1945,

1492
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:07,580
but this is what I've always said about 
Hollywood and this is one of the real 

1493
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:09,420
problems with the people that are 
involved in the business,

1494
01:05:09,421 --> 01:05:11,610
not just in terms of like the way it's 
set up,

1495
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:15,810
but the problems for the person that's 
doing it.

1496
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:17,740
That's trying to be an actor,
an actress.

1497
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:18,220
Here's

1498
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:23,220
the problem.
You have to get picked so because you 

1499
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:26,821
have to get picked,
you have to go into places like please 

1500
01:05:26,821 --> 01:05:26,821
like me and you're already fucking 
insecure,

1501
01:05:26,821 --> 01:05:28,000
which is why you're an actress in the 
first place.

1502
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:33,210
The reason why you're an actor in the 
first place because you want an 

1503
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:33,400
exorbitant amount of attention.
You probably didn't get it when you were

1504
01:05:33,401 --> 01:05:35,140
younger.
There's something missing.

1505
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:39,240
People like Daniel Day Lewis or he's a 
different cat male.

1506
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:41,860
There's a few of those things out there,
like there's a few of those.

1507
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:47,430
Especially Daniel Day Lewis.
He's been working the last two years is 

1508
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:47,430
a cobbler.
Yeah,

1509
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:48,580
fucking shoes.
He's my favorite.

1510
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:50,500
I love that.
He's such a Weirdo.

1511
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:55,790
You know,
and then when you watch him in some 

1512
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:55,790
movies,
you know,

1513
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:55,790
like there will be blood and you're 
like,

1514
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:55,790
oh,
okay.

1515
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:58,000
This is like you're.
You're not even really acting.

1516
01:05:58,180 --> 01:05:59,560
You just become new people.

1517
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:05,030
Yeah.
Like is that he becomes the guy on the 

1518
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:05,350
set all the time.
He's the guy all day.

1519
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:07,420
I don't want to spend that much time 
outside of my body.

1520
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:12,480
I don't either.
But the problem that I faced when I 

1521
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:13,900
first came here was I got,
first of all,

1522
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:16,910
I never wanted to act.
I had zero intention.

1523
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:22,010
I wanted to be a comic,
but then I started getting these 

1524
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:24,871
development deals.
I went on to auditions in my very first,

1525
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:28,000
my,
my early days of being an actor.

1526
01:06:28,001 --> 01:06:30,160
I got both shows.
That's,

1527
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,860
that's.
I got this show called hardball and then

1528
01:06:32,861 --> 01:06:37,861
I got news radio.
Those were the two first two auditions 

1529
01:06:37,861 --> 01:06:37,861
that I ever went on.
I know I didn't,

1530
01:06:37,861 --> 01:06:42,630
I just got lucky.
I mean I got his fucking lucky as a 

1531
01:06:42,630 --> 01:06:46,171
person can get.
Part of it was because I didn't want to 

1532
01:06:46,171 --> 01:06:48,520
do acting.
I wasn't nervous about it and also I was

1533
01:06:48,521 --> 01:06:53,521
coming from fighting.
So was used to like really being 

1534
01:06:53,521 --> 01:06:53,521
nervous.

1535
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,140
Yeah.
So I could go in there like,

1536
01:06:56,141 --> 01:06:56,740
Hey,
what's up?

1537
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,600
How you guys doing?
I was fine.

1538
01:06:58,630 --> 01:06:59,690
I think it's,
there's a kick in the nose.

1539
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:00,660
It's fine.
Yeah.

1540
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,890
I'm not going to get a concussion and 
bleed out of my ears.

1541
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:07,060
This,
but this environment where you're always

1542
01:07:07,061 --> 01:07:10,510
wanting to get picked.
That's why everybody out here is fucking

1543
01:07:10,511 --> 01:07:12,220
left wing.
It's not even there.

1544
01:07:12,221 --> 01:07:14,380
They're really left lane.
They have to be.

1545
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:18,550
You have to wear a pink pussy hat.
You have to say,

1546
01:07:18,551 --> 01:07:20,860
you know all the things that you need to
say.

1547
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:25,990
You're,
you're literally formulating an act and 

1548
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:29,110
you bring that act into auditions.
You bring that act onto the red carpet.

1549
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:34,260
That's why you're seeing these people 
like Harvey Weinstein who would donate 

1550
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:37,291
to the Clinton campaign and do all this.
What seemed to be like very left wing 

1551
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:40,120
stuff.
You know,

1552
01:07:40,121 --> 01:07:42,760
and he was the darling of left wing,
amy's Miramax,

1553
01:07:42,761 --> 01:07:45,370
which is really kind of a progressive 
studio.

1554
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:46,870
People will thought me,
wow,

1555
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:50,740
this is just a house of sexual assault.
Allegedly,

1556
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:52,900
you can be a total pervert and have good
politics,

1557
01:07:52,901 --> 01:07:54,160
bad politics,
I don't think.

1558
01:07:54,161 --> 01:07:55,510
But that's not a pervert,
right?

1559
01:07:55,540 --> 01:08:00,310
There's a difference between what he is 
in a perfect total psychopath predator.

1560
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:02,140
Um,
and it's interesting too,

1561
01:08:02,141 --> 01:08:04,450
because look,
donald trump's a fucking.

1562
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:06,010
He's.
These are the worst.

1563
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:11,250
That being said,
we're going out and we're attacking 

1564
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:11,250
people.
There are people like,

1565
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:12,550
I don't speak to my parents.
They voted for trump.

1566
01:08:12,551 --> 01:08:13,330
And I'm like,
cool.

1567
01:08:13,331 --> 01:08:16,400
Well when they're dead you can,
you can rethink

1568
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,420
that.
Those four years,

1569
01:08:17,421 --> 01:08:20,030
you know,
and we out actors,

1570
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:21,500
like he's a Republican.
Like,

1571
01:08:21,501 --> 01:08:23,300
what are you doing?
Well,

1572
01:08:23,301 --> 01:08:24,500
some of them revel in it,
right?

1573
01:08:24,501 --> 01:08:26,510
Like James Woods,
he's hilarious.

1574
01:08:26,511 --> 01:08:28,730
He's on twitter all day long fighting 
with liberals,

1575
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:31,520
but he also was not of the best moral 
ground.

1576
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:36,800
Here's something interesting on my book,
there is a Weinstein logo.

1577
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:42,320
A,
my book is the last one to be published 

1578
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:46,030
on the back or it's in the,
it's on the spine and what I've been 

1579
01:08:46,371 --> 01:08:48,590
likening to and I feel like the people 
and now it's a shit,

1580
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:51,020
like they got absorbed.
Weinstein books was only two women.

1581
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:54,020
It wasn't like a huge company.
I'd never met him or anything.

1582
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:59,440
I liken it to like when your grandpa 
comes back from World War Two and he 

1583
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:01,070
brings back like a plate with a Nazi 
insignia on it.

1584
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:03,080
Like because they had,
they made their own shit,

1585
01:09:03,081 --> 01:09:04,970
like Nazis had like a whole home goods 
line.

1586
01:09:05,370 --> 01:09:07,670
Um,
and he brings that one thing back.

1587
01:09:07,671 --> 01:09:09,950
That's what that book is like.
One of the last ones.

1588
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:15,000
MMM.
With the wwe now they don't have them 

1589
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:15,000
anymore.
Well,

1590
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:15,250
look,
before this had happened,

1591
01:09:15,370 --> 01:09:19,120
anybody would've done a miramax movie.
He was the guy,

1592
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:21,670
I mean the fucking movies that they put 
together.

1593
01:09:21,671 --> 01:09:23,560
They put together some of the greatest 
movies of all time.

1594
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:29,230
I think it's crazy.
I think we're getting to a place now 

1595
01:09:29,230 --> 01:09:29,230
where we're realizing,
oh yeah,

1596
01:09:29,230 --> 01:09:33,190
for every everything.
There was an upside down every the 

1597
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:34,030
upside down world,
there's a whole stranger thing.

1598
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:38,330
There's an underbelly to every.
Every business you can think of,

1599
01:09:38,331 --> 01:09:41,660
there is a CD,
horrible side of it with horrible people

1600
01:09:41,870 --> 01:09:44,090
and most of us choose to live in the 
light and thing.

1601
01:09:44,091 --> 01:09:49,091
Things are good.
Every industry has that and we're just 

1602
01:09:49,091 --> 01:09:52,991
at a place now where like we're kind of 
shaking it out and people are coming 

1603
01:09:52,991 --> 01:09:55,481
forward,
but this has always existed and it's 

1604
01:09:55,481 --> 01:09:55,520
rampant in every business.

1605
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:57,120
Don't you think?
There's also,

1606
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:02,460
there's like there's systems,
right,

1607
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:07,940
and system systems of power where 
someone gets to a position where they 

1608
01:10:08,851 --> 01:10:13,851
have this massive amount of power almost
like royalty and what a guy like Harvey 

1609
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,840
Harvey Weinstein was essentially like a 
royal in some ways,

1610
01:10:18,841 --> 01:10:20,640
right?
Like royalty,

1611
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:22,430
massive power,
right?

1612
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:27,710
Massive money.
Got All of these people terrified of 

1613
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:27,710
him.
This big booming figure,

1614
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,640
almost like a kingdom would cut your 
head off.

1615
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:33,120
Right?
And when you have that kind of power,

1616
01:10:33,121 --> 01:10:38,121
it's such an unrealistic position to be 
in that.

1617
01:10:38,221 --> 01:10:42,420
I think it's human nature to exploit 
those unrealistic positions.

1618
01:10:42,421 --> 01:10:47,421
That's why this Maureen O'hara articles 
fascinating to me because this has 

1619
01:10:47,421 --> 01:10:52,371
always been the case,
these unrealistic positions where 

1620
01:10:52,371 --> 01:10:55,521
someone has to get chosen.
There's one person who has a billion 

1621
01:10:55,521 --> 01:10:59,070
dollars and makes 100 movies a year and 
every people have to be chosen to be the

1622
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:02,430
chosen ones to be in those movies.
So you have a whole ecosystem,

1623
01:11:02,431 --> 01:11:07,431
right?
And then you have people that are 

1624
01:11:07,431 --> 01:11:07,431
depending on that ecosystem for their 
own survival.

1625
01:11:07,431 --> 01:11:09,030
Nobody,
even if they know something wants to say

1626
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:09,630
anything,
it's like,

1627
01:11:09,631 --> 01:11:10,350
well,
I didn't know.

1628
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:15,600
Well,
you can't be the first one and then get 

1629
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:15,600
fired and then you're fucked.

1630
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:15,600
Right?
That's what they're thinking.

1631
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:17,640
You don't want to be the first one.
That's the other thing.

1632
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:19,870
You don't want to be first,
right?

1633
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:22,290
Because rose McGowan was talking about 
this stuff forever and they're like,

1634
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:23,460
whatever.
She's crazy.

1635
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:25,440
Nobody wants,
especially for women.

1636
01:11:25,441 --> 01:11:28,230
Nobody wants to listen to that woman.
And historically,

1637
01:11:28,231 --> 01:11:29,580
you know,
like Monica Lewinsky,

1638
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:34,880
her life got wrapped and she was a young
woman with the most powerful man in the 

1639
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,770
world and we love Bill Clinton and she 
gets called a whore.

1640
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:43,070
You know,
so it was a paradigm shift where people 

1641
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:46,971
are now speaking and in terms of like if
you're talking about exalting one 

1642
01:11:46,971 --> 01:11:48,300
position and someone getting chosen,
that's shifting to people are like,

1643
01:11:48,301 --> 01:11:49,380
fuck it,
I got a cell phone.

1644
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:53,040
I don't need your movie.
I have 8 billion followers on instagram.

1645
01:11:53,041 --> 01:11:54,510
You know,
I'll just show my book.

1646
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:59,630
I'll just show my,
but I'll just make a video about me 

1647
01:11:59,630 --> 01:11:59,630
eating pizza.

1648
01:11:59,630 --> 01:12:01,260
I'm relatable now and so everything is 
shifting.

1649
01:12:01,261 --> 01:12:04,770
Everything shaking out.
I don't think this is ever gonna go away

1650
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,570
because if you're the kind of guy that 
does that,

1651
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:08,940
that's just something you're going to 
think you're wrong.

1652
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,160
I think it's going away.
I don't.

1653
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:14,190
I don't see how.
I just don't think you can get away with

1654
01:12:14,191 --> 01:12:15,090
it anymore.
Well,

1655
01:12:15,091 --> 01:12:20,091
it's for sure going to get watered down.
There's always going to be some amount 

1656
01:12:20,101 --> 01:12:25,101
of influence.
Powerful people have that are in a 

1657
01:12:25,101 --> 01:12:27,770
position where they're choosing people,
but you're implying that if you are that

1658
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,270
kind of crazy where you're assaulting 
women,

1659
01:12:30,271 --> 01:12:32,940
that you are choosing good over evil.
You just do.

1660
01:12:32,941 --> 01:12:35,140
If you're a predator,
you pray on things,

1661
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:40,160
but he couldn't do that when he was 20 
and he didn't have any money and nobody 

1662
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:41,480
might've done it a different way.
I think so he might've been.

1663
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:43,590
It's just who he is.
I think sometimes it's who you are.

1664
01:12:43,591 --> 01:12:46,380
So this whole I went to rehab.
I'm apologizing,

1665
01:12:46,381 --> 01:12:47,520
I'm to,
I'm going to listen.

1666
01:12:47,521 --> 01:12:52,521
I'm so sorry.
It's like it's who you are and you can 

1667
01:12:52,521 --> 01:12:52,521
maybe stop,
but that.

1668
01:12:52,521 --> 01:12:53,760
I do believe that that's.
We like to think,

1669
01:12:53,761 --> 01:12:58,761
oh,
I'll just go home and reflect for a 

1670
01:12:58,761 --> 01:13:00,201
little bit.
I love that they have a rehab that they 

1671
01:13:00,201 --> 01:13:00,810
all go to break for a week.
Give me a break.

1672
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,520
We can fix you.
Is it Canyon ranch?

1673
01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:06,330
I don't know what it's called.
It's not Kevin Spacey's there right now.

1674
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:07,830
They go for a week,
but I will say,

1675
01:13:07,831 --> 01:13:10,770
you know,
absolute power corrupts absolutely.

1676
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:15,600
So Dave becky gave the whole gay,
wrote a follow up letter to Lucy ks,

1677
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:20,630
which I thought was,
it sounded very genuine and there is 

1678
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:20,990
something to,
you know,

1679
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,400
we have these levels that you exist on,
you know,

1680
01:13:23,401 --> 01:13:25,890
and you can't be aware.

1681
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,110
I feel like I'm going to put my foot in 
my mouth,

1682
01:13:28,111 --> 01:13:30,900
but you can't be aware of everything 
that's going on all the time.

1683
01:13:30,901 --> 01:13:35,901
Some people think he was aware of it,
but when you're dealing with these high 

1684
01:13:35,901 --> 01:13:39,411
level deals and you're at a certain 
dollar amount and you're flying high 

1685
01:13:39,411 --> 01:13:42,501
above everyone else,
you genuinely might not know what's 

1686
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:45,501
going on,
but you almost have a responsibility 

1687
01:13:45,501 --> 01:13:45,700
when you are that powerful and someone 
tells you something about your client to

1688
01:13:45,701 --> 01:13:48,420
like maybe take it seriously.
If I go on a twitter rant,

1689
01:13:48,421 --> 01:13:49,410
my manager calls,
she's was like,

1690
01:13:49,411 --> 01:13:50,540
you're acting like a maniac.
Right?

1691
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:51,150
Okay.
But let's,

1692
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:52,800
let's follow that up then.
What,

1693
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:54,300
what does one do?
I don't know.

1694
01:13:54,301 --> 01:13:55,950
So if someone is a dave,
becky,

1695
01:13:56,220 --> 01:13:59,010
and you think that this woman might be 
telling the truth,

1696
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:02,010
and I don't know what Louis said today,
Becky,

1697
01:14:02,011 --> 01:14:07,011
but we know that Louis told Mark Marin 
ally as mark baron talked about it on 

1698
01:14:07,261 --> 01:14:09,720
his podcast and he said that he asked 
him,

1699
01:14:09,721 --> 01:14:11,130
hey man,
are you jerk it off girls?

1700
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:11,560
He said,
no,

1701
01:14:11,561 --> 01:14:12,880
I'm not.
It's just a rumor.

1702
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:14,110
It's bullshit.
He goes,

1703
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:16,480
why don't you just talk about this 
rumor?

1704
01:14:16,481 --> 01:14:17,280
And he goes,
I can't,

1705
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:19,570
you can't do that because then it'll 
give it credence.

1706
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:24,820
Which I guess I kind of understand if it
wasn't true,

1707
01:14:25,690 --> 01:14:27,820
but I don't think I have an answer.
Yeah,

1708
01:14:27,821 --> 01:14:29,170
I don't have one either.
I definitely don't.

1709
01:14:29,171 --> 01:14:32,230
I don't want to seem like I'm going one 
side or the other.

1710
01:14:32,231 --> 01:14:34,420
It's disgusting and it's horrible.
But there's also,

1711
01:14:34,421 --> 01:14:37,210
when you hear inklings of rumors,
you hear like little things.

1712
01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:42,660
Everybody always says like when their 
kid ends up killing a bunch of people 

1713
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:42,660
that are like,
I didn't know.

1714
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:44,800
And as the public were like,
how could you not know he exhibited x,

1715
01:14:44,801 --> 01:14:45,490
Y,
and Z,

1716
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:46,600
you know,
he did all this.

1717
01:14:46,601 --> 01:14:49,180
He had a gun in his room.
He decapitated rabbits.

1718
01:14:49,181 --> 01:14:50,170
How could you not know?

1719
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:55,620
Maybe sometimes we are too close to 
something and you don't want it to be 

1720
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:55,620
true.
Well,

1721
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:56,620
what about that Vegas shooter?
Oh my God.

1722
01:14:56,660 --> 01:15:00,010
Like that guy had nothing.
He had no criminal background.

1723
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:04,270
No one had any idea.
He gave his girlfriend $100,000.

1724
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:07,600
She thought he was breaking up with her 
and she thought he was giving her money.

1725
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:12,660
Right?
He was just giving her money to get by 

1726
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:14,621
and while he was going to murder 50 
fucking people are 58 people and kill 

1727
01:15:14,621 --> 01:15:17,990
himself can apply rationale to an 
irrational thing where we don't know.

1728
01:15:18,170 --> 01:15:20,260
Well,
any sort of situation like that.

1729
01:15:20,261 --> 01:15:22,920
School shooters.
Did you see the um,

1730
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,600
most armed man in America piece that 
went out?

1731
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:27,400
No.
Can you pull this up?

1732
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:30,070
There's a guy who the most godly man in 
Colorado,

1733
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:32,590
his last name is Bernstein.
So as a Jew I was like,

1734
01:15:32,591 --> 01:15:35,260
why are we profiling the one Jew that's 
a gun nut?

1735
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:36,790
Great.
Uh,

1736
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:38,830
he lives in America.
Most are.

1737
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:41,350
Manny has like $3,000,000
worth of artillery.

1738
01:15:41,550 --> 01:15:44,400
You've got to watch this.
He has several shooting ranges.

1739
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:45,880
Shit burning,
but wait,

1740
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:49,450
so his name Bernie is Bernie like 
Epstein or something.

1741
01:15:49,451 --> 01:15:51,310
It's terrible.
He's got tanks.

1742
01:15:51,370 --> 01:15:53,910
He's got tanks.
He's got blamed for growers.

1743
01:15:54,570 --> 01:15:56,490
But first,
yeah,

1744
01:15:56,530 --> 01:15:58,720
until I do want to partner.
You go in his house.

1745
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:00,000
Nope.
Oh good.

1746
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:04,000
Three percent of Americans.
According to a recent study,

1747
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:06,700
over 50 percent of guns,
you probably fall into that group.

1748
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,810
Why do you think so few people have such
a large concentration of weapons?

1749
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,210
You get addicted to them.
You know,

1750
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:15,860
it gets you in your blood,
but driving up my property now and uh,

1751
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:18,310
there's all kinds of warning signs.
As you can see.

1752
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:22,240
If anybody comes on your property and 
threatens you with bodily harm,

1753
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:24,820
it's illegal to shoot from Colorado law.

1754
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,520
They should have.
Sounds like my dad is.

1755
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:29,990
This is one of the first signs I see.
One guy was a registered democrat.

1756
01:16:29,991 --> 01:16:34,240
It says he's got old cars laid out with 
dolls,

1757
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:37,590
manikins and bullet holes all over the 
car.

1758
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:40,090
The number you want to party with him,
you'll see.

1759
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:41,470
Oh,
do want to party with him?

1760
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:43,050
If,
if you're going to listen,

1761
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:44,470
if we're going to,
not a lot,

1762
01:16:44,890 --> 01:16:49,890
just like one night I tell you what 
happens at the end or do you want to 

1763
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:49,890
watch what happens?
He dies.

1764
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:51,000
No one talks about.
They're like,

1765
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:52,590
so your wife uh,
died.

1766
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:54,400
Oh Jesus,
he killed his wife.

1767
01:16:54,401 --> 01:16:55,750
No,
look at this.

1768
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,810
He's getting mannequins,
mannequins,

1769
01:16:58,811 --> 01:17:03,811
dressed up in women's clothing.
He changes their underwear when it gets 

1770
01:17:03,881 --> 01:17:05,320
cold outside.
Oh,

1771
01:17:05,321 --> 01:17:10,321
Mel.
And this guy is the most heavily armed 

1772
01:17:10,321 --> 01:17:10,321
men in America.
Legally.

1773
01:17:10,321 --> 01:17:14,230
You know,
we've talked about machine guns and hot 

1774
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:14,720
rods and Dino stuff highlights,
I don't really care what you like.

1775
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:16,100
So she never says nothing.
Anyway.

1776
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:19,550
I'm real nice to them when it gets cold 
in the winter I put underwear.

1777
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:21,140
He's got a New York accent.
Yeah,

1778
01:17:21,141 --> 01:17:23,680
he's a Jewish guy from the bronx or 
something.

1779
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:28,690
Lives on a ranch in Colorado that's 
filled with bullets and guns and 

1780
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:31,250
mannequins and he's got his own 
firewood.

1781
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:35,750
His wife died and an explosion,
but the way he describes it,

1782
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:36,790
he was like,
we were shooting the show.

1783
01:17:36,791 --> 01:17:41,791
I think it was for like a and e and the 
last day some they were walking through 

1784
01:17:41,791 --> 01:17:43,970
smoke and one of the smoke canisters 
turn into like a rocket.

1785
01:17:43,971 --> 01:17:45,700
It just went through her.
Oh Jeez.

1786
01:17:45,710 --> 01:17:48,040
He describes it as if I was describing 
what I had for lunch.

1787
01:17:48,041 --> 01:17:49,640
He's like,
I went through her and they canceled the

1788
01:17:49,641 --> 01:17:50,430
show.
Throw it all away.

1789
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:53,480
Not a tear.
Nothing about the wife.

1790
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,310
She's just more like in the show's over.

1791
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:58,040
It's crazy.
Clip.

1792
01:17:59,330 --> 01:18:04,330
Whoa.
That guy's probably waiting for someone 

1793
01:18:04,330 --> 01:18:06,110
to trespass.
Like he's like putting out chocolate and

1794
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:09,290
money,
like on a string and these old too.

1795
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:12,180
So he's got like not much left.
You know.

1796
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,290
How much time does he have left but 
about his girlfriends.

1797
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:17,200
He's got a girlfriend.
The mannequins mean I can do.

1798
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:19,250
Would you want to meet him and interview
him?

1799
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:22,250
Oh,
how about a show on Netflix called Eliza

1800
01:18:22,251 --> 01:18:25,760
interview psychopath.
It's just all comics,

1801
01:18:25,970 --> 01:18:27,770
you know,
comics.

1802
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:33,070
She doesn't meet at the store.
Just whoever watches this guy you with 

1803
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:35,870
preppers.
It would just be cut back to me.

1804
01:18:35,871 --> 01:18:37,750
Just staring at him with my mouth open 
with his.

1805
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:41,380
All the soldiers and plastic than other 
video on another channel I've found just

1806
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:42,950
loves mannequins.
Oh,

1807
01:18:42,951 --> 01:18:45,980
this guy's so creepy.
Maybe doesn't like people.

1808
01:18:45,981 --> 01:18:47,570
And this is like how he sort of.

1809
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:51,350
There's a lot of shit.
Look at the size of his fucking house.

1810
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:53,980
This kind of rocket launchers.
This guy's.

1811
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:55,880
Where's he getting the money for?
All this stuff.

1812
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,850
Sells guns to.
Oh,

1813
01:18:58,010 --> 01:18:58,490
two.
Who?

1814
01:18:58,491 --> 01:19:00,170
I don't know.
One by one of his guns.

1815
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:02,930
He can contribute to this.
Uh,

1816
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:04,460
it's too late.
Yeah.

1817
01:19:04,461 --> 01:19:09,461
He was like,
in the last couple of weeks we've sold 

1818
01:19:09,461 --> 01:19:09,461
more guns that we have the whole year.
Well,

1819
01:19:09,461 --> 01:19:10,970
here's the thing,
if this guy dies,

1820
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:16,150
whereas all this fucking weaponry going,
I just hope the state swoop in and in 

1821
01:19:16,150 --> 01:19:20,591
Colorado,
Colorado is the wrong place to pull out 

1822
01:19:20,591 --> 01:19:20,750
a gun.
Fucking everybody's armed.

1823
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:23,360
Everybody's armed and now everyone's 
high.

1824
01:19:23,770 --> 01:19:27,080
You're paranoid to things.
He's Got Samurai swords.

1825
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:32,110
Jesus Christ was like this fucking guy.
Interesting character.

1826
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:39,640
Yeah.
There's a lot of people out there like 

1827
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:39,640
that in Texas.
Texas is crazy.

1828
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:39,920
I grew up shooting,
not all the time,

1829
01:19:39,921 --> 01:19:40,730
but we would go.

1830
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,170
My best friend's parents would do these,
I'm sort of not reenactment shootings,

1831
01:19:45,171 --> 01:19:50,171
but they would dress up in period 
costumes like late 19th century and we 

1832
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:55,640
would go out to the country and they 
would have these little fake town set up

1833
01:19:55,641 --> 01:20:00,641
and it was like timed event shootings 
and they all had names like boy named 

1834
01:20:00,641 --> 01:20:04,211
sue and they had like their cowboy names
and you'd shoot and you'd win like an 

1835
01:20:04,211 --> 01:20:07,450
antique coin or something,
but they would go and Mr Hewitt had all 

1836
01:20:07,450 --> 01:20:11,310
the rifles and the guns and shoot at a 
was like targets.

1837
01:20:11,311 --> 01:20:16,311
Like I remember one was like just the 
sort of outline of like a fake saloon 

1838
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:19,950
town kind of thing and it's time timed.
You try to get your targets and we would

1839
01:20:19,951 --> 01:20:24,951
just drink dr pepper and watched,
but because I didn't and I've shot guns 

1840
01:20:24,951 --> 01:20:27,300
a couple of times,
it doesn't do much for me so my thing.

1841
01:20:28,150 --> 01:20:30,960
But he had a lot of them don't even like
hunting with them.

1842
01:20:31,610 --> 01:20:36,610
Do you just.
I feel like you are so masculine that 

1843
01:20:36,610 --> 01:20:39,471
you see an elk,
you're like time me and you just run 

1844
01:20:39,471 --> 01:20:39,540
alongside it.
Tackle it by the neck and you just punch

1845
01:20:39,541 --> 01:20:40,940
it into submission.
No,

1846
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:42,580
you can't even get close to them.
No,

1847
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:45,420
they can't even know you're there early 
Joe.

1848
01:20:45,421 --> 01:20:46,830
You can't.
You can't tackle an elk.

1849
01:20:46,831 --> 01:20:47,400
Okay,
cool.

1850
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:52,950
We might be able to tackle like a calf.
He's brand new baby.

1851
01:20:52,951 --> 01:20:54,080
Cow Elk.
You know.

1852
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:58,290
Do you want to do something crazy?
A baby.

1853
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,840
Crazy.
A pony is not a baby horse.

1854
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:03,090
It's not.
Isn't that crazy?

1855
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:04,620
What's a baby horse?
A Colt.

1856
01:21:04,650 --> 01:21:08,490
The foal of full.
What's a cult then a horse.

1857
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:10,200
Oh,
Colt is like a full grown horse.

1858
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:13,140
So pony is like a type of horse.
It's its own kind of horse.

1859
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:14,510
Isn't that crazy?
See,

1860
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:16,140
I always thought a pony.
That's right.

1861
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:19,080
I should know that.
I love telling people that fact.

1862
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:23,700
I should know that pony.
Babyhood registers.

1863
01:21:24,650 --> 01:21:29,650
You knew it.
What is so a donkey?

1864
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:35,180
What's.
What's the difference in a mule and a 

1865
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:35,180
donkey?
One the same as.

1866
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:35,180
No.
One of them is a hybrid.

1867
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:38,030
A DM is a hybrid between a horse.
A donkey is a horse and I'm.

1868
01:21:38,370 --> 01:21:39,660
Nope,
a mule,

1869
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:42,420
a mule and a donkey at the same thing.
Well,

1870
01:21:42,421 --> 01:21:45,120
one of them is a hybrid and it's 
non-viable.

1871
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:47,010
I know that.
Do you mean non-viable?

1872
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:52,040
Meaning hybrid's.
A lot of hybrids can't breed reduced 

1873
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:52,320
when you breed a male donkey with a 
female horse.

1874
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:53,100
Okay.
That's it.

1875
01:21:53,130 --> 01:21:55,590
Notice the mayor.
It's also an ugly type of shoe.

1876
01:21:56,270 --> 01:21:59,710
A hiney meanwhile is a mules and ugly 
kind of shoe.

1877
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,230
For Women.
It's like a slip on.

1878
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:03,680
Put that up.
It looks like enough with the folks who,

1879
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:09,950
by the way,
so many of your fans who like live in 

1880
01:22:09,950 --> 01:22:12,111
rural areas are like,
I can't believe these people don't know 

1881
01:22:12,111 --> 01:22:14,080
the difference in the idiots.
It's just ugly fat one,

1882
01:22:14,090 --> 01:22:19,090
but.
But if you really hot you can pull that 

1883
01:22:19,090 --> 01:22:19,090
off.
Guys,

1884
01:22:19,090 --> 01:22:19,090
don't give a fuck.
They don't get it.

1885
01:22:19,090 --> 01:22:19,090
But like that's a.
that's,

1886
01:22:19,090 --> 01:22:23,510
that's a.
That does seem like a satanic sort of a 

1887
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:23,510
thing.
Park goat.

1888
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:24,750
No,
it's not even clothing.

1889
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:28,110
The reason why I know this is because we
got mule.

1890
01:22:28,111 --> 01:22:33,111
Come for fear factor.
It's cheaper to make people drink meal.

1891
01:22:33,361 --> 01:22:38,361
Come [inaudible].
Mule come doesn't really become 

1892
01:22:38,361 --> 01:22:38,361
anything.
It's just,

1893
01:22:38,361 --> 01:22:38,430
it's not good.
How did you say that?

1894
01:22:38,431 --> 01:22:42,710
On the show?
Mule emissions sperm.

1895
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:44,460
Oh my God.
We said sperm.

1896
01:22:44,570 --> 01:22:45,440
Yeah.
Yeah.

1897
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:50,620
It wasn't my idea.
That's what got the show canceled 

1898
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:53,211
though.
I'm one of the few people in show 

1899
01:22:53,211 --> 01:22:54,300
business that has a show canceled 
because we made people drink.

1900
01:22:54,301 --> 01:22:56,760
Come.
I think the only one maybe ever.

1901
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:58,860
I feel like there's a lot more than you 
think.

1902
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:06,340
Yeah,
there's probably some behind the scenes 

1903
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:06,340
stuff off camera.
There's no way.

1904
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:06,340
They drank as much.
Guarantee

1905
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:09,490
that one minute meals on the video on 
youtube.

1906
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:12,370
Oh,
Donkey Jews.

1907
01:23:12,430 --> 01:23:13,840
Interesting.
Well,

1908
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:15,670
yeah,
that's it.

1909
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:17,700
That's what girls have to go through.
Well,

1910
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:22,770
that was what's interesting.
What they choose between come and urine 

1911
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:28,080
yet a drink,
like a vat of urine and a vat of a come 

1912
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:32,480
and a lot of the girls chose to come 
over the urine because at least we.

1913
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:35,020
It's a similar beast.
You've been there before.

1914
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,390
Oh my God.
Yeah.

1915
01:23:37,570 --> 01:23:41,650
I don't want to watch any day.
Yeah.

1916
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,560
Amazing.
I love her running eyeliner.

1917
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:46,570
That's how the show got canceled right 
there.

1918
01:23:46,571 --> 01:23:48,670
Ladies and gentlemen,
kill you now.

1919
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:51,280
No.
Urine is nothing.

1920
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,800
Urine is just like.
You can only drink your own urine.

1921
01:23:53,801 --> 01:23:55,810
I think eight times.
I love that she's got.

1922
01:23:56,540 --> 01:23:58,600
It's like doing the acid,
doing it more than eight times.

1923
01:23:58,601 --> 01:23:59,890
You become insane.
Is that true?

1924
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:00,420
No,
no.

1925
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:01,060
Oh No.

1926
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:04,030
It's a fact about drinking.
You can only drink if you're stranded.

1927
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:07,300
You can only drink your urine a certain 
amount of times before it becomes toxic.

1928
01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:10,440
Did you read about those two women that 
got up?

1929
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:15,510
They got stuck at sea for like five 
months with their dog eat the dog.

1930
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:23,130
They had like a year's supply of food on
the boat so that apparently it's falling

1931
01:24:23,741 --> 01:24:27,100
apart.
The stories falling apart and now people

1932
01:24:27,101 --> 01:24:30,760
don't even believe they were really 
stranded as long as they were like.

1933
01:24:30,761 --> 01:24:33,730
Apparently people were suspicious right 
away because they were too well kept.

1934
01:24:34,150 --> 01:24:39,150
Yeah,
so and then now their story would have 

1935
01:24:39,150 --> 01:24:42,251
been reading and I should shouldn't 
really comment on it until I see if he 

1936
01:24:42,251 --> 01:24:45,301
could find out.
I don't know how much of how much it's 

1937
01:24:45,301 --> 01:24:46,600
fallen apart because I was reading 
something about how it continues to fall

1938
01:24:46,601 --> 01:24:47,080
apart.

1939
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:49,960
The story continues with like they 
might've just pretended to be at sea for

1940
01:24:49,961 --> 01:24:53,520
five months because you would eat that,
that you would eat that dog also,

1941
01:24:53,610 --> 01:24:56,470
like you might not if you have a year 
supply of food.

1942
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:57,340
Sure.
Okay.

1943
01:24:57,341 --> 01:25:02,341
Right.
You can have those like Alex Jones 

1944
01:25:02,341 --> 01:25:02,740
supplies those fucking buckets at Jim 
Baker pushes.

1945
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:06,880
Have you ever seen that at the end time?
Rescued?

1946
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,570
Stick with their story.
You would say the same thing.

1947
01:25:10,571 --> 01:25:11,560
I did.
Well,

1948
01:25:11,561 --> 01:25:14,970
there's an easy way to fact check this 
report.

1949
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:16,960
Did you leave like who's the last person
you saw?

1950
01:25:18,070 --> 01:25:23,070
I guess they're having some issues.
There's some people that think it's 

1951
01:25:23,070 --> 01:25:26,341
bullshit.
They claimed daily distress calls were 

1952
01:25:26,341 --> 01:25:27,550
unanswered and at one point tiger sharks
bumped against the boat.

1953
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:29,740
Might be real.
Well,

1954
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:33,100
you can fact check those distress calls.
See if tiger sharks live in that area.

1955
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:34,170
They do.
Yeah.

1956
01:25:34,370 --> 01:25:36,320
That's around Hawaii.
That's where they were.

1957
01:25:36,890 --> 01:25:41,890
That's one of the.
One of the real problems with Hawaii is 

1958
01:25:41,890 --> 01:25:44,641
tiger sharks.
Tiger sharks are one of the most 

1959
01:25:44,641 --> 01:25:45,610
aggressive of sharks and they get people
all the time.

1960
01:25:45,611 --> 01:25:50,611
I think second only to bull sharks.
What does it say indicating that they 

1961
01:25:50,611 --> 01:25:54,511
had like an emergency beacon that if 
they would have activated it would have 

1962
01:25:54,511 --> 01:25:56,260
alerted this coast guard would have been
found really fast,

1963
01:25:56,290 --> 01:25:58,210
but they didn't,
but they for some reason didn't,

1964
01:25:58,830 --> 01:26:03,830
didn't know about it necessarily.
There was no storms recorded on 

1965
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:04,430
satellite images that have,
I guess supposedly

1966
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:07,670
also what they said caused their 
disappearance.

1967
01:26:08,910 --> 01:26:11,360
Eliza looks to stick up for girls though
and host that.

1968
01:26:11,470 --> 01:26:13,070
I have not read this story.
I'm just looking at,

1969
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:15,650
you know what I was honestly thinking.
No,

1970
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:20,680
I was just like,
of course the two lesbians have like a 

1971
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:22,880
giant dog.
I'm assuming one of them is like 46.

1972
01:26:22,881 --> 01:26:25,640
One of them is 25,
so I think they're probably lesbians who

1973
01:26:25,641 --> 01:26:27,020
knows,
but like that's such a lesbian,

1974
01:26:27,021 --> 01:26:28,940
like he's a pit mix,
but we love him.

1975
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:32,240
Yeah.
Because like the big disparity in age,

1976
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:37,360
that's like the difference between like 
a guy with a yacht and it's hot 

1977
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:37,360
girlfriend.
Who knows?

1978
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:38,840
Maybe she's,
she's her instructor.

1979
01:26:38,870 --> 01:26:40,760
You know what I love most about lesbian 
couples?

1980
01:26:41,150 --> 01:26:43,550
There's almost always like a male and a 
female.

1981
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:45,380
Yeah.
Sometimes.

1982
01:26:45,470 --> 01:26:46,400
Yeah.
Sometimes.

1983
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:49,520
Well,
a lot of the time my best friend and her

1984
01:26:49,521 --> 01:26:54,521
wife said,
obviously they're married and so your 

1985
01:26:54,521 --> 01:26:54,521
best friends,
lesbian,

1986
01:26:54,521 --> 01:26:54,521
lesbian,
you were so diverse,

1987
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:58,240
but she,
we've noticed everything.

1988
01:26:58,290 --> 01:27:02,000
We are three and so she is,
she was a lesbian when she was three.

1989
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:05,540
She gave us like the quarterback in high
school.

1990
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:08,030
That's probably ruined her.
I think she kind of just figured it out.

1991
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:10,000
I mean he was a psychopath,
but um,

1992
01:27:10,670 --> 01:27:12,500
so they're married and they want to have
a baby.

1993
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:14,030
And Michelle,
sorry,

1994
01:27:14,031 --> 01:27:15,060
Michelle.
Uh,

1995
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:17,390
you keep her name up.
We're both Jewish,

1996
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:19,460
white.
She's half my body weight.

1997
01:27:19,461 --> 01:27:22,790
She's the tiniest and kind of sickly.
She has like plantar fasciitis.

1998
01:27:22,791 --> 01:27:23,990
She's got her own issues,
right?

1999
01:27:24,290 --> 01:27:27,920
So she wants to carry the baby and her 
wife is American,

2000
01:27:27,921 --> 01:27:30,890
but Dominican and like strong.
She's like,

2001
01:27:30,891 --> 01:27:32,060
but I want to carry the baby.
I'm like,

2002
01:27:32,061 --> 01:27:32,220
no,
no,

2003
01:27:32,221 --> 01:27:32,570
no,
no.

2004
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:36,440
Our people have like Tay Sachs and,
and uh,

2005
01:27:37,190 --> 01:27:38,590
then,
uh,

2006
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:41,990
like just diseases like pass the sec.
It's like a Jewish thing.

2007
01:27:41,991 --> 01:27:45,170
It's like a genetic mutation that only 
Jewish babies get.

2008
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:47,060
But the point is Jews have to deal with 
that.

2009
01:27:47,061 --> 01:27:52,061
I'm like,
her people are given birth left and 

2010
01:27:52,061 --> 01:27:52,061
right and going back to work the same 
day.

2011
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:55,040
They don't carry the baby and I'm like 
trying to encourage her.

2012
01:27:55,041 --> 01:27:56,810
I'm like,
let let the other one do it.

2013
01:27:56,890 --> 01:27:57,350
She's like,
no,

2014
01:27:57,351 --> 01:28:02,351
I just want to.
I want to go through it because she's 

2015
01:28:02,351 --> 01:28:02,351
the.
I guess if you had to pick one who's the

2016
01:28:02,351 --> 01:28:03,710
boy,
but Michelle wants to do and I'm like,

2017
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:08,711
you're going to get snapped and how 
you're going to fit yourself and you're 

2018
01:28:08,711 --> 01:28:09,770
going to just be a puddle of Jewish skin
and bones.

2019
01:28:10,430 --> 01:28:12,410
Let the other one do it.
Are you going to have babies?

2020
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:16,190
I thinking about that,
so I'm getting married in May and then I

2021
01:28:16,191 --> 01:28:18,260
was talking to your boyfriend's a very 
nice guy,

2022
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:19,780
fiance.
He loves you.

2023
01:28:19,781 --> 01:28:20,750
He loves coming to the store.

2024
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:22,370
He's a good dude.
He's a good guy.

2025
01:28:22,490 --> 01:28:23,690
And I was just like,
I guess I was like,

2026
01:28:23,691 --> 01:28:24,710
we'll get married,
we'll go on a honeymoon.

2027
01:28:24,711 --> 01:28:26,930
I was like,
I guess we have those happy when you got

2028
01:28:26,931 --> 01:28:29,240
them.
So it was like finally one good one.

2029
01:28:29,870 --> 01:28:31,400
This one's going to stick.
I get rid of him,

2030
01:28:31,610 --> 01:28:34,510
the Yale story in that one.
That was.

2031
01:28:34,511 --> 01:28:36,740
That was so it was like three years ago.
It was quite awhile ago.

2032
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:39,080
That was a great story though when you 
brought him around.

2033
01:28:39,081 --> 01:28:39,650
I'm like,
well,

2034
01:28:39,710 --> 01:28:40,970
I don't want to be too friendly with 
them.

2035
01:28:40,971 --> 01:28:43,130
You know?
It's like war.

2036
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:45,230
Yeah,
the new guy might get shot,

2037
01:28:45,710 --> 01:28:47,480
but then after a couple months it was 
like,

2038
01:28:47,481 --> 01:28:48,530
hey,
you're still here.

2039
01:28:48,531 --> 01:28:53,531
What's up man?
And then we became more and more 

2040
01:28:53,531 --> 01:28:53,531
friendly.
You're like,

2041
01:28:53,531 --> 01:28:54,070
I don't want to be cool to this guy.
She might get rid of them.

2042
01:28:54,110 --> 01:28:56,750
Every time I see him a hug him.
He loves you.

2043
01:28:56,751 --> 01:28:58,690
He loves seeing it.
Loves watching all the company.

2044
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:00,860
He's a fan of comedy anyway.
Not in a weird way,

2045
01:29:00,861 --> 01:29:05,861
but like he listened to your podcast.
I think it's cool for him and he's super

2046
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:06,870
supportive,
but I was like,

2047
01:29:06,871 --> 01:29:11,220
I guess we just have a baby.
Like I guess you do that viable.

2048
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:12,420
I don't know.
Many more years.

2049
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:14,220
Got kind of a quick,
I don't know,

2050
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,200
checking my stat card.
Did you get an.

2051
01:29:16,450 --> 01:29:17,730
I don't have.
I only have one.

2052
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:18,620
Your eggs,
you cook them.

2053
01:29:18,710 --> 01:29:21,210
I have one big egg.
One giant one like an ostrich.

2054
01:29:21,211 --> 01:29:24,810
I keep it in the back of yourself.
A little gladiator baby.

2055
01:29:24,811 --> 01:29:27,120
Like some strong man baby.
I've always wanted that.

2056
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:28,830
Do you think you'll have a boy or a 
girl?

2057
01:29:29,150 --> 01:29:30,780
Do you have a feeling?
Can I say this?

2058
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:35,060
So I didn't know his job when I was 18 
and which is tiny.

2059
01:29:35,190 --> 01:29:40,190
That's why your nose is so tiny.
Would you knows you still look like a 

2060
01:29:40,190 --> 01:29:44,070
little bit of a bump.
It was their worst things didn't shrink 

2061
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:44,070
your nostril holes?
No,

2062
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:46,860
I always had small nostril hold down.
So you just got rid of the bump.

2063
01:29:47,060 --> 01:29:48,650
The bump.
It's.

2064
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:51,060
I talk about in the book,
it's not like a huge revelation.

2065
01:29:51,150 --> 01:29:52,290
I'm Jewish,
like we do this,

2066
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:57,291
but he's half Italian,
half Jewish and he's got a big nose and 

2067
01:29:57,291 --> 01:29:57,900
I remember looking at it the other day 
and I was like,

2068
01:29:57,930 --> 01:30:02,930
our kid had better be fucking brilliant 
or amazing at sports because if a girl 

2069
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:06,540
has a combination of our noses,
it's over for her.

2070
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:11,100
So fingers crossed that she gets someone
else's knows,

2071
01:30:11,101 --> 01:30:13,020
maybe by the time you guys decided to 
have babies,

2072
01:30:13,021 --> 01:30:18,021
crispr will be totally dialed in,
get a nice little Christie Brinkley 

2073
01:30:18,021 --> 01:30:18,160
knows.
I don't know,

2074
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:19,140
maybe we'll have.

2075
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:21,300
It'll be an APP at that point.
Or if it's a dude,

2076
01:30:21,630 --> 01:30:23,490
a big nose just gives you like 
character.

2077
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:27,180
Big Nose for dude is fine and I'm 
praying because he's very tall.

2078
01:30:27,181 --> 01:30:29,460
If it's a girl,
maybe she's just a brilliant athlete and

2079
01:30:29,461 --> 01:30:30,390
then it's like,
who cares?

2080
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:32,190
Right.
But it's probably not gonna happen.

2081
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:34,950
Probably just be kind of funny.
And who knows,

2082
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:40,580
who knows.
That's the interesting thing about 

2083
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:40,580
having children that I've found is that 
they come out of the box,

2084
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:42,750
their own little mind,
their own little personality.

2085
01:30:42,751 --> 01:30:45,180
You just kind of nurture that 
personality along the way.

2086
01:30:45,181 --> 01:30:50,181
But you know,
my two youngest daughters could not be 

2087
01:30:50,181 --> 01:30:50,790
different.
They're so similar to each other.

2088
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:53,250
They're there so dissimilar rather to 
each other.

2089
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:54,750
Yeah.
That happens.

2090
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:57,930
My brother and I are,
I don't know where he's from,

2091
01:30:57,931 --> 01:31:00,630
the planet Zap Guitar and we just,
uh,

2092
01:31:01,230 --> 01:31:04,880
I don't know,
it's just the way it would just be.

2093
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:10,200
It's a weird combination of like we're 
talking about nurture and nature and do 

2094
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:15,131
you,
but see the thing is about a woman 

2095
01:31:15,131 --> 01:31:16,230
having a baby go on.
Is that you,

2096
01:31:16,290 --> 01:31:21,290
especially as a comic,
it would be much more difficult for you 

2097
01:31:21,290 --> 01:31:23,050
to do the road?
I think.

2098
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:24,960
I think,
I don't know anything about it.

2099
01:31:24,961 --> 01:31:26,020
I don't know,
you know,

2100
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:31,040
I know that I work out a lot and so 
obviously the more mobile and healthy 

2101
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:31,040
you are,
it's easier,

2102
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:35,220
you know,
there's a couple of months where you 

2103
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:36,351
can't,
but there's also a couple of months of 

2104
01:31:36,351 --> 01:31:36,351
the year where I don't do the road 
anyway.

2105
01:31:36,351 --> 01:31:38,760
Like I think I could tailor the schedule
around it and we certainly could because

2106
01:31:38,761 --> 01:31:43,761
you're successful because you make 
enough money to hire help and hire 

2107
01:31:43,761 --> 01:31:45,060
people to help you when you travel.
Oh my God,

2108
01:31:45,061 --> 01:31:46,650
absolutely.
I don't know.

2109
01:31:46,651 --> 01:31:48,990
But your whole life changed.
I think about that a lot.

2110
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:50,370
Uh,
you know,

2111
01:31:50,371 --> 01:31:51,570
it's at night,
it's 10:00.

2112
01:31:51,571 --> 01:31:52,650
I'm like,
let's go grab dinner.

2113
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:54,960
Don't do that,
do that.

2114
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:58,800
So I don't know,
I guess that's like the next step,

2115
01:31:58,801 --> 01:32:00,250
but you just adjust.

2116
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:04,660
Your life becomes so much,
it becomes very strange,

2117
01:32:05,230 --> 01:32:08,510
like hanging out with your own kids is.
It's,

2118
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:14,000
it's very odd because the love that you 
feel for them is so intense and so 

2119
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:14,270
weird.
Yeah.

2120
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:17,200
It's like this warm,
cuddly love,

2121
01:32:17,470 --> 01:32:20,230
but it's also like while you're doing 
it,

2122
01:32:20,290 --> 01:32:20,830
you're,
you're,

2123
01:32:20,850 --> 01:32:23,230
you're cuddling with your kid,
you know,

2124
01:32:23,231 --> 01:32:25,540
talking with them and while you're 
talking with them,

2125
01:32:25,690 --> 01:32:27,070
for me at least,
I'm like,

2126
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:32,100
I can't even believe you're real.
You can't even believe this is a 

2127
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:33,730
daughter.
Like I have a daughter for forever.

2128
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,590
Yeah.
And we're talking and she's like,

2129
01:32:35,591 --> 01:32:36,470
well,
what do you think about that?

2130
01:32:36,471 --> 01:32:37,150
I'm like,
no,

2131
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:38,760
what do you think about that?
And we're having a little calmer.

2132
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:40,780
You're worried that they're thinking at 
all.

2133
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,310
You're like,
you were just a puddle of mush.

2134
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:44,740
So I don't know,
but I'm open to.

2135
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:47,860
I think a big problem in our society is 
that we expect women,

2136
01:32:47,861 --> 01:32:50,170
like you've got to have this career,
have this body,

2137
01:32:50,171 --> 01:32:52,210
have this family,
but why do we do that?

2138
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:54,040
We do that because it's always been that
way.

2139
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:56,680
Who is we in this group?
Right?

2140
01:32:56,740 --> 01:33:01,740
But how many people do that?
How many people do expect you to have 

2141
01:33:01,740 --> 01:33:02,050
all these things?
I think it's a projection,

2142
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:05,230
but obviously when you get down to it,
nobody cares what you actually do.

2143
01:33:05,470 --> 01:33:10,470
But it's what's put out there as what 
looks like happiness and I even talk 

2144
01:33:10,470 --> 01:33:14,461
about this because I never,
I'm not trying to pretend like what I'm 

2145
01:33:14,461 --> 01:33:14,461
saying is something I'm thinking about 
right now.

2146
01:33:14,461 --> 01:33:14,950
I've thought about it.
I wrote about it.

2147
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:20,400
It,
you do have to do this digging to be 

2148
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,381
like,
what does my happiness actually look 

2149
01:33:22,381 --> 01:33:24,881
like?
And it might not be the cookie cutter 

2150
01:33:24,881 --> 01:33:26,020
image that is kind of put on all of us.
Like I have a very weird job,

2151
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:29,500
but if I couldn't do this job I would,
I would be the saddest person.

2152
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:33,920
Like standup comedy gives me the most 
joy and uh,

2153
01:33:34,510 --> 01:33:39,510
that is a huge.
I'm in a relationship with that and I 

2154
01:33:39,510 --> 01:33:39,510
have to factor everything sort of around
it.

2155
01:33:39,850 --> 01:33:42,280
Yeah.
Until I have a kid.

2156
01:33:42,281 --> 01:33:43,980
And then who knows?
You don't have one.

2157
01:33:44,530 --> 01:33:45,470
It does change.
I mean,

2158
01:33:45,471 --> 01:33:47,430
I hate to say Louis C,
k game.

2159
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:50,530
He created place once came to having a 
kid,

2160
01:33:50,740 --> 01:33:52,300
which is very odd.
What he said.

2161
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:55,390
Let it change you and I don't know Louis
very well.

2162
01:33:55,391 --> 01:33:57,600
I should say this too because people,
somebody,

2163
01:33:57,640 --> 01:34:00,070
somebody was giving me a hard time about
not commenting on it.

2164
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:00,670
No.
My,

2165
01:34:00,730 --> 01:34:05,730
my thought was like,
first of all I want to gather my 

2166
01:34:05,730 --> 01:34:05,730
thoughts.
Absolutely.

2167
01:34:05,730 --> 01:34:07,450
And second of all,
I don't know him that well.

2168
01:34:07,451 --> 01:34:12,451
I don't even have his phone number.
I've never had a phone call 

2169
01:34:12,451 --> 01:34:13,900
conversations with him.
I bet we've exchanged emails maybe three

2170
01:34:13,901 --> 01:34:18,310
times ever and he and I have run into 
each other at clubs and said hi,

2171
01:34:18,490 --> 01:34:20,800
we've never gone out and hung out 
together.

2172
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:24,070
I'm not good friends with them.
So when all this was going down,

2173
01:34:24,790 --> 01:34:29,790
it's not like I had information.
Like if Joey Diaz did something fucked 

2174
01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:30,880
up and people wanted me to comment,
first of all,

2175
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,600
I would never say anything bad no matter
what joy diaz did.

2176
01:34:34,690 --> 01:34:36,970
Sorry.
That's just the way it is.

2177
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:39,100
If there's just no way around.
Yeah.

2178
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:40,920
If you knew he raped someone,
this is horrible.

2179
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,770
Alright,
so sorry that he did that,

2180
01:34:44,430 --> 01:34:46,140
but when,
you know,

2181
01:34:46,141 --> 01:34:47,970
I mean I,
I would never,

2182
01:34:49,770 --> 01:34:50,970
I would never throw them under the bus,

2183
01:34:51,220 --> 01:34:56,220
you know what I'm saying?
There's bus throwing and then there's 

2184
01:34:56,220 --> 01:34:58,561
bus throwing,
there's a comment after sort of 

2185
01:34:58,561 --> 01:35:01,530
condemning,
condemning it and then there was of 

2186
01:35:01,530 --> 01:35:02,030
course like there was a guy who was in 
that movie baby driver,

2187
01:35:02,210 --> 01:35:03,650
um,
and he asked us,

2188
01:35:03,940 --> 01:35:08,940
no,
it was like at the 48th lead or 

2189
01:35:08,940 --> 01:35:11,561
something and he went on some show and 
just went off about Kevin and so 

2190
01:35:11,561 --> 01:35:12,880
everyone's like,
it was like,

2191
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:15,020
it looked like a way to get attention.
Like yeah,

2192
01:35:15,021 --> 01:35:18,860
when I was on set he didn't seem that 
cool and it was so much in retrospect,

2193
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:21,200
but he's not the guy that's on the 
walking dead,

2194
01:35:21,201 --> 01:35:22,490
the punisher guy.
I don't know,

2195
01:35:22,540 --> 01:35:23,870
isn't that him?
I just saw that.

2196
01:35:24,290 --> 01:35:29,290
Yeah,
I think it's that guy who's pretty 

2197
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:29,290
successful.
He's,

2198
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:31,670
he's the new punisher in that Netflix 
just seemed very like bandwagon jumping.

2199
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:36,700
When the Louis C K thing happened.
I can speak from a perspective of a 

2200
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:36,700
woman who's seen this kind of stuff.
I don't know.

2201
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:39,530
I brought him up twice at the store.
That's my knowledge of him.

2202
01:35:39,950 --> 01:35:42,980
But you get these emails from like the 
New York Times or like,

2203
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:48,040
Hey,
if you have anything you want to say or 

2204
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:48,040
if you know any other things,
I'm like,

2205
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:48,350
I don't and I don't want to attach 
myself.

2206
01:35:48,710 --> 01:35:53,710
I don't want to be like,
I didn't want to be part of that story 

2207
01:35:53,710 --> 01:35:54,290
just for the sake of it.
Because then you look like a fame whore.

2208
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:59,750
Well that's also the problem.
Like you get caught up in something 

2209
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:03,140
where you become inexorably connected to
this awful event and you didn't do 

2210
01:36:03,961 --> 01:36:04,290
anything.

2211
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:05,630
Sure.
Yeah.

2212
01:36:05,810 --> 01:36:08,660
So Joey didn't do anything.
It was just like,

2213
01:36:09,150 --> 01:36:10,090
not joey,
Joey,

2214
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:13,580
but oddly enough,
it's crazy as joey is,

2215
01:36:13,581 --> 01:36:16,340
he's a very gentle person.
He's a giant.

2216
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:18,890
He's Puerto Rican.
He's Cuban.

2217
01:36:18,891 --> 01:36:20,540
Sorry.
Giant Cuban teddy bear.

2218
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:23,990
He is because he seems so tough and he 
loves St Cox Soccer,

2219
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:26,270
but he is just,
he's like,

2220
01:36:26,390 --> 01:36:29,270
he's just so kind and he's got these 
eyes like a whale,

2221
01:36:29,390 --> 01:36:32,570
like they're just ancient and big,
like the camel eyelashes.

2222
01:36:33,050 --> 01:36:36,800
He's got these lovely I and you and he 
smiles at you like a toddler.

2223
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:38,990
I love him.
He's the best.

2224
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:43,350
I exchanged emails with him maybe once 
every three or four years.

2225
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:48,560
We've texted each other maybe 10 times 
ever for all only phone calls.

2226
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:52,680
Calls me every couple of days.
What's up cock sucker.

2227
01:36:52,860 --> 01:36:53,640
What are you doing,
brother?

2228
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:55,890
What's going on?
Is He wants to talk to you.

2229
01:36:56,220 --> 01:37:01,220
Joey wants to talk to you.
If I ever ever text him is because I 

2230
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:01,230
have to send an address to him.
You know,

2231
01:37:01,231 --> 01:37:03,060
he's got to like put it in his 
navigation system.

2232
01:37:03,090 --> 01:37:04,310
That's it.
He,

2233
01:37:04,380 --> 01:37:05,880
he calls you.
He lovely.

2234
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:06,710
Yeah.
He's,

2235
01:37:06,740 --> 01:37:10,280
he's a beautiful person and you know,
he,

2236
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:11,690
he and I were talking about this whole 
Louis,

2237
01:37:11,691 --> 01:37:12,750
c,
k thing and he was like,

2238
01:37:12,751 --> 01:37:13,290
you know,
he goes,

2239
01:37:13,291 --> 01:37:15,060
you know what's fucking crazy?
He was like,

2240
01:37:15,330 --> 01:37:19,380
I held somebody at gunpoint.
He goes,

2241
01:37:19,620 --> 01:37:21,870
he goes,
fuck fucking kidnapping.

2242
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:23,130
And everybody's like,
ah,

2243
01:37:23,131 --> 01:37:23,760
you were crazy.

2244
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:27,730
But it goes like,
this is the kind of thing.

2245
01:37:28,450 --> 01:37:32,200
This is the kind of thing that sticks 
because he did it to one of us.

2246
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:37,210
Right?
Like if you in our world like we are all

2247
01:37:37,570 --> 01:37:39,730
the same,
we're all the same thing.

2248
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:42,990
I mean there's gonna be some weird 
pettiness and bullshit and there's gonna

2249
01:37:43,010 --> 01:37:46,720
be some prejudices and it's going to be 
some individuals that are supportive,

2250
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:52,020
but overall amongst the good eggs 
amongst the ones that you and I 

2251
01:37:52,150 --> 01:37:53,860
associate with,
we are all.

2252
01:37:54,010 --> 01:37:55,770
We all consider each other same thing.

2253
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:57,060
Good.
We are,

2254
01:37:57,150 --> 01:38:00,490
we understand each other's hearts and we
know how hard it is and what it's like.

2255
01:38:00,491 --> 01:38:03,430
And we all know that it's us.
Even though the audiences are friends,

2256
01:38:03,431 --> 01:38:05,560
it's US versus them.
It's the club versus you know,

2257
01:38:05,561 --> 01:38:10,240
you're trying to do a job and we know 
exactly what this very weird job entails

2258
01:38:10,390 --> 01:38:15,390
and we know the way the other person 
thinks like we have fucked up thoughts 

2259
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:18,960
and it's okay to admit these thoughts to
each other and it's a very special bond 

2260
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:19,840
and you can't just be like,
I'm a comic.

2261
01:38:19,841 --> 01:38:24,841
I get it.
Like you have to kind of earn it and 

2262
01:38:24,841 --> 01:38:27,271
there's a respect there.
And so it's what he did as deplorable 

2263
01:38:27,271 --> 01:38:31,470
and it was with other comics and I feel 
bad because I feel bad because everybody

2264
01:38:32,381 --> 01:38:33,790
gets so angry at women,
they're like,

2265
01:38:33,791 --> 01:38:34,750
why now?
And I'm like,

2266
01:38:34,780 --> 01:38:37,810
because there's safety in numbers and no
one would listen before.

2267
01:38:38,140 --> 01:38:39,850
But people knew,
they knew.

2268
01:38:40,230 --> 01:38:41,920
Some people knew.
They knew to a degree.

2269
01:38:41,921 --> 01:38:45,340
Like I knew I knew the girls names,
but I didn't know if it was true.

2270
01:38:45,341 --> 01:38:50,341
It was a rumor you don't know and you 
don't want to be the one that's running 

2271
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:52,810
out there like with a lit torch and 
you're wrong.

2272
01:38:53,010 --> 01:38:58,010
It's going to sound fucked up,
but I'm going to take a chance with it 

2273
01:38:58,010 --> 01:38:58,010
anyway.
You Ready?

2274
01:38:58,010 --> 01:39:01,580
Have you put yourself?
Like I put myself in Harvey Weinstein's 

2275
01:39:03,451 --> 01:39:04,680
brain.
Not Really,

2276
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:07,080
but I sat down and I tried to think 
like,

2277
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:08,840
what,
what,

2278
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:12,200
what would this guy like?
How would his brain work?

2279
01:39:12,201 --> 01:39:16,590
Because he just like,
like lost in the throes of the addiction

2280
01:39:16,591 --> 01:39:21,591
of power and sex in this chase of 
getting all these superstars to suck his

2281
01:39:21,811 --> 01:39:26,811
dick.
Which is apparently what a lot of them 

2282
01:39:26,811 --> 01:39:28,521
did.
I mean I've talked to women that know 

2283
01:39:28,521 --> 01:39:29,220
people in the business and it was like 
negotiating tactic,

2284
01:39:29,221 --> 01:39:31,760
like yeah,
he would give them roles if they did and

2285
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:34,940
he always followed up.
He always honored his word was wondering

2286
01:39:34,950 --> 01:39:35,610
about that.
Yeah.

2287
01:39:35,611 --> 01:39:37,980
I was wondering like how do you ensure 
someone gives you the part?

2288
01:39:38,430 --> 01:39:40,530
I don't know.
I mean he had a reputation for doing it,

2289
01:39:40,531 --> 01:39:41,000
you know,
the,

2290
01:39:41,001 --> 01:39:43,600
the,
the contract thing that he had you,

2291
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:47,470
his contract with,
with Miramax,

2292
01:39:47,490 --> 01:39:48,450
with the Weinstein group.

2293
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:50,220
Oh,
it was like a sexual harassment.

2294
01:39:50,221 --> 01:39:51,180
Like a clause.
Yeah,

2295
01:39:51,530 --> 01:39:52,220
covering up too.

2296
01:39:52,340 --> 01:39:57,340
But they had it like in tears,
like one would be worth two fifths 

2297
01:39:57,340 --> 01:39:59,720
because they knew it was fucking crazy.
They knew.

2298
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:03,350
I mean that is.
If that's not complicit then what is.

2299
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:08,500
But have you done,
have you tried to put yourself in the 

2300
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:08,500
Louis Ck is brain?

2301
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:12,960
Yes and no because I definitely have had
this thought.

2302
01:40:13,890 --> 01:40:17,930
I think when you get to a certain level,
and I see there's,

2303
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:20,310
this wasn't at that level then this is 
the thing.

2304
01:40:20,810 --> 01:40:22,410
We did a poll and it was a long time 
ago.

2305
01:40:22,650 --> 01:40:27,650
Let me find,
forget the level I've found with a lot 

2306
01:40:27,650 --> 01:40:30,831
of male comics.
There is a certain like a lot of 

2307
01:40:30,831 --> 01:40:30,831
perverts,
whatever.

2308
01:40:30,831 --> 01:40:33,960
There's a certain set of blinders,
like I can do whatever I want.

2309
01:40:33,961 --> 01:40:35,760
There's almost like a lack of 
accountability.

2310
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,850
You show up drunk or high or fucked up 
and they're like,

2311
01:40:38,851 --> 01:40:39,960
oh,
he's so creative.

2312
01:40:40,230 --> 01:40:44,160
It's a certain allowance we give to men 
and then people when they get famous,

2313
01:40:44,310 --> 01:40:45,800
you can do whatever you want.
I,

2314
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:47,850
I pride myself.
I'm always on time.

2315
01:40:47,851 --> 01:40:50,400
I don't show up anywhere drunk like I 
just take it a little bit more seriously

2316
01:40:50,401 --> 01:40:54,400
because I know I have to work a little 
bit harder whether being a girl helps or

2317
01:40:54,401 --> 01:40:55,420
not at times.

2318
01:40:55,420 --> 01:41:00,420
It just depends on the day.
I do think that there's a lack of 

2319
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:04,741
awareness about other people and I do 
think at a certain level there is a 

2320
01:41:04,741 --> 01:41:08,521
mindset of like,
because I've seen this in lower tiered 

2321
01:41:08,521 --> 01:41:11,641
comics,
she doesn't matter what I say to you 

2322
01:41:11,641 --> 01:41:13,510
when I call you a bitch or a piece of 
shit or I harass you,

2323
01:41:13,810 --> 01:41:16,360
you don't matter because you're not 
gonna make it.

2324
01:41:16,420 --> 01:41:18,610
You're not going to make it.
You don't matter.

2325
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:21,130
And I do.
I've seen this.

2326
01:41:21,131 --> 01:41:26,131
I'm not going to go into names.
I've heard things that other women will 

2327
01:41:26,131 --> 01:41:28,330
confide in me that men say to them.
I remember starting at the store,

2328
01:41:28,630 --> 01:41:32,350
things that were said to me by men who 
probably don't remember.

2329
01:41:32,351 --> 01:41:34,660
They said it cause there's like a 
cavalier.

2330
01:41:34,661 --> 01:41:37,060
Just I'll just say fucking whatever I 
hurt.

2331
01:41:37,061 --> 01:41:38,650
I want her to hurt.
Fuck you.

2332
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:39,430
You're a bitch.

2333
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:41,170
You're body's discussing.
You don't matter.

2334
01:41:41,830 --> 01:41:43,780
Your body is disgusting.
That's the.

2335
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:44,860
That's the weird one,
right?

2336
01:41:44,861 --> 01:41:47,140
Like I hurt.
So I want her to hurt.

2337
01:41:47,170 --> 01:41:52,170
There's a comic at the store.
All the guys are friends with all of 

2338
01:41:52,170 --> 01:41:52,170
them.
Me,

2339
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:56,500
I don't know.
Maybe he's not there a ton anymore.

2340
01:41:56,501 --> 01:42:01,501
It was definitely.
He was definitely like a fixture there 

2341
01:42:01,501 --> 01:42:01,501
in the early years when I was there,
I,

2342
01:42:01,501 --> 01:42:03,130
we were at another comic's house for a 
party.

2343
01:42:03,340 --> 01:42:05,500
I was standing there and he walked up to
me.

2344
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:10,620
I hadn't said a word.
He said something rude to a girlfriend 

2345
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:12,601
of mine because he was hitting on her 
and that didn't go well and he just 

2346
01:42:12,601 --> 01:42:12,640
looked at me and he went,
you better keep working out because your

2347
01:42:12,641 --> 01:42:13,990
body's not going to be like that 
forever.

2348
01:42:14,730 --> 01:42:15,760
And I was like,
hi.

2349
01:42:16,810 --> 01:42:21,810
And the only other thing he ever said to
me was like 10 years later he yelled at 

2350
01:42:21,810 --> 01:42:21,940
me because I brought my dog to the 
store,

2351
01:42:22,810 --> 01:42:24,720
but it was body does look like though 
forever,

2352
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:27,940
but also like stupid things stupid and 
it's so.

2353
01:42:27,940 --> 01:42:31,570
It's meant to for me to be like,
why did you say that we should go fuck,

2354
01:42:31,571 --> 01:42:34,030
that will help.
And it did not have.

2355
01:42:34,090 --> 01:42:39,090
Does that work?
It must work on the most deprived girls 

2356
01:42:39,090 --> 01:42:40,150
and he just picked the wrong one,
but it of course,

2357
01:42:40,210 --> 01:42:45,210
but that doesn't.
Does that work on the girls with the 

2358
01:42:45,210 --> 01:42:46,120
lowest self esteem?
Does that ever work?

2359
01:42:46,180 --> 01:42:47,980
It must.
It must.

2360
01:42:47,981 --> 01:42:50,090
Or they might think it works or are you 
engaging?

2361
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:50,980
Then it turns out,
oh,

2362
01:42:50,981 --> 01:42:52,480
he's a nice guy.
I don't know,

2363
01:42:52,510 --> 01:42:53,680
maybe it's like one of those,
hey,

2364
01:42:53,681 --> 01:42:54,600
you should smile.
Look,

2365
01:42:54,610 --> 01:42:56,290
it never works,
but it's been nice.

2366
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:59,080
I think it's more of like,
I don't know how to talk.

2367
01:42:59,081 --> 01:43:00,570
So you start with that and then the 
girls like,

2368
01:43:00,571 --> 01:43:02,530
I was smiling and he's like,
oh cool.

2369
01:43:02,610 --> 01:43:05,560
And it's just like an opening for 
someone who's not as articulate,

2370
01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:07,250
awkward opening from.

2371
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:09,340
I was,
I'm not going to say the state,

2372
01:43:09,370 --> 01:43:11,140
so we'll just say it was California,
but it wasn't.

2373
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:13,060
I was,
I was headlining a club.

2374
01:43:13,580 --> 01:43:15,970
Um,
so as years and years and years ago,

2375
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:21,000
because the club is not that great.
And there was a guy who was opening for 

2376
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:25,231
me and it's weird.
My power dynamic is different because 

2377
01:43:25,231 --> 01:43:28,651
I'm the headliner,
I've never told a guy he has to like 

2378
01:43:28,651 --> 01:43:28,660
sleep with me to get a gig or something 
like that.

2379
01:43:29,170 --> 01:43:31,120
And I went,
oh my,

2380
01:43:31,150 --> 01:43:33,220
just like licking my purse and left and 
right.

2381
01:43:33,490 --> 01:43:35,000
My box,
I'm okay.

2382
01:43:35,020 --> 01:43:35,650
I did it once.
Okay.

2383
01:43:35,651 --> 01:43:40,270
So he was the opener and he was like,
oh,

2384
01:43:40,271 --> 01:43:43,870
can I show you around?
Which as the opener behooves you like to

2385
01:43:43,871 --> 01:43:45,880
be nice to the headliner.
Like if I like you,

2386
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:48,700
I have plenty of friends that I just 
take with me because they were cool.

2387
01:43:48,970 --> 01:43:50,560
Um,
so we like hung out.

2388
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:51,770
We got,
we just say,

2389
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:56,780
show me around his shitty city.
And then on that Saturday night I had a 

2390
01:43:56,780 --> 01:43:58,370
friend in town,
it was like a guy and I left with them.

2391
01:43:58,371 --> 01:44:03,371
We all went to a bar and I left with the
guy that I was friends with and this 

2392
01:44:03,371 --> 01:44:05,960
comic lost his shit.
Started sending me texts,

2393
01:44:05,961 --> 01:44:06,830
like,
how could you,

2394
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:09,440
I spent all this time with you,
do you know who I am?

2395
01:44:09,441 --> 01:44:11,360
Like just losing it.
And I'm like,

2396
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:13,100
and I left.
I was out of the city,

2397
01:44:13,101 --> 01:44:17,480
I was going somewhere else and he's 
harassing me and I contacted a friend of

2398
01:44:17,481 --> 01:44:20,030
ours was a mutual friend and I was like,
you better check your boy.

2399
01:44:20,031 --> 01:44:21,050
Like,
what is his problem?

2400
01:44:21,051 --> 01:44:21,560
He's like,
no,

2401
01:44:21,561 --> 01:44:22,880
he's a good guy.
He's my friend,

2402
01:44:22,881 --> 01:44:27,881
like,
did nothing to defend me and this guy's 

2403
01:44:27,881 --> 01:44:28,370
just like spewing this vitriolic 
garbage.

2404
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:31,580
Actually I think sober,
but you could be right.

2405
01:44:31,581 --> 01:44:36,581
I don't know.
And the other day I was at the Improv 

2406
01:44:36,581 --> 01:44:40,330
and this piece of shit was the host and 
I was like closing the show out and I 

2407
01:44:40,701 --> 01:44:45,701
hadn't seen him in years and I wasn't 
about to give him the satisfaction or 

2408
01:44:45,701 --> 01:44:48,851
anything and I go on and he bought,
he died a thousand deaths and I was just

2409
01:44:48,921 --> 01:44:53,921
sitting there watching and I know that 
he knew that I was there and he knew 

2410
01:44:53,921 --> 01:44:53,921
what he had done.
So they felt like shit.

2411
01:44:53,921 --> 01:44:55,750
I felt like shit.
And then he was onstage.

2412
01:44:55,970 --> 01:45:00,970
I'm not,
I can't tell the restaurant that I know 

2413
01:45:00,970 --> 01:45:02,500
no matter,
but he left his phone on stage and I 

2414
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:02,500
made him come back up and get it.
I was like,

2415
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:07,001
Hey,
he was calling himself like he had like 

2416
01:45:07,001 --> 01:45:07,040
a cool nickname for himself.
I called him back and he had to like,

2417
01:45:07,041 --> 01:45:08,840
come get his phone and then I fucking 
wrecked it.

2418
01:45:09,290 --> 01:45:12,590
But it was more like,
you thought I was nobody you thought you

2419
01:45:12,591 --> 01:45:17,591
could treat me like that.
But why did he think that if he was the 

2420
01:45:17,591 --> 01:45:19,961
opening act,
because he probably thought I didn't 

2421
01:45:19,961 --> 01:45:21,380
deserve it or he's a crazy person or 
because I was in his city,

2422
01:45:21,890 --> 01:45:26,210
but I'd never seen behavior like that 
exhibited by someone who was opening for

2423
01:45:26,211 --> 01:45:27,480
me.
But it was just like

2424
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:32,070
male female shit that's like he was 
courting you.

2425
01:45:32,340 --> 01:45:34,740
He thought that he got mad that I left 
with someone else.

2426
01:45:34,770 --> 01:45:39,770
He thought that you and him were hanging
out and that you liked him and it was 

2427
01:45:39,770 --> 01:45:41,280
eventually going to lead to him banging 
the chicken.

2428
01:45:41,281 --> 01:45:43,000
One last comic standing.
I just want to be

2429
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:44,690
before ever had right after it.
Yeah.

2430
01:45:44,700 --> 01:45:49,700
No,
I would have been after a and I'm sure 

2431
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:49,700
that if you were heading,
it was after for sure,

2432
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:51,600
but I'm sure that girls like I've heard,
you know,

2433
01:45:52,050 --> 01:45:53,180
male friends of mine,
like you,

2434
01:45:53,181 --> 01:45:55,380
I fuck all my openers,
you know like guys do that.

2435
01:45:55,381 --> 01:45:58,920
I've never had the luxury.
Sounds like a bad practice.

2436
01:45:58,921 --> 01:46:01,560
Seems like a super gross practice.
But I think a lot of guys do.

2437
01:46:01,561 --> 01:46:03,210
It just doesn't seem smart.

2438
01:46:04,670 --> 01:46:06,020
I always tell guys to not.
Well,

2439
01:46:06,230 --> 01:46:11,230
I should never say don't fuck other 
comedians because like Tom Seger and 

2440
01:46:11,230 --> 01:46:11,810
Christina [inaudible],
they're great.

2441
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:14,510
That worked out.
That worked out like Moshe Kasher,

2442
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:16,190
Natasha Leggiero that worked out.

2443
01:46:16,230 --> 01:46:19,770
I think it either works out splendidly 
or is a nightmare.

2444
01:46:20,270 --> 01:46:21,990
Right?
I don't know.

2445
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:23,560
Yeah.
Well,

2446
01:46:23,650 --> 01:46:28,650
one thing would be that the person would
understand what you do because very few 

2447
01:46:28,650 --> 01:46:29,120
people do.
I think,

2448
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:34,200
and I would think as a girl,
it's got to be hard when you're the 

2449
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:37,861
funny one,
like if you're the funny one and you're 

2450
01:46:37,861 --> 01:46:37,861
dating a guy and maybe they.
Well you're see,

2451
01:46:37,861 --> 01:46:40,570
that's the thing is your fiance is so 
chill.

2452
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:41,590
Like

2453
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:44,590
he's so funny too,
but he doesn't need.

2454
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:46,390
He doesn't need any attention.
That's the,

2455
01:46:46,450 --> 01:46:48,910
that's the dynamic.
There is one of,

2456
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:54,200
you know,
and I don't really seek it out outside 

2457
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:54,570
of Sannup I'm not.
When you get it all out.

2458
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:59,720
Yeah.
Get it out of your system and I don't 

2459
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:00,080
want to be greedy about it and sometimes
you don't know,

2460
01:47:00,081 --> 01:47:00,690
you know,
you don't know.

2461
01:47:00,691 --> 01:47:02,130
You start dating someone,
then you realize,

2462
01:47:02,131 --> 01:47:03,670
oh,
they can't handle this other gels,

2463
01:47:03,690 --> 01:47:06,300
but it takes a minute.
And with comics it's interesting.

2464
01:47:06,301 --> 01:47:11,301
You rarely see a super successful female
comic with like a guy that's like 

2465
01:47:11,301 --> 01:47:12,600
middling at the chuckle bucket.

2466
01:47:12,740 --> 01:47:14,930
Never,
never.

2467
01:47:14,990 --> 01:47:17,630
Can you think of one?
I don't know any of them.

2468
01:47:17,930 --> 01:47:22,930
I don't know any like headliners that 
fuck their opening acts that are girls 

2469
01:47:23,710 --> 01:47:27,700
now and I mean maybe they do.
Maybe it's cool if they do a cool.

2470
01:47:28,100 --> 01:47:30,970
That's cool.
I think that fence.

2471
01:47:31,340 --> 01:47:32,150
Yeah,
let them know.

2472
01:47:32,540 --> 01:47:35,600
Flip the script.
Yeah.

2473
01:47:36,210 --> 01:47:38,990
Like just get back to the business of 
comedy.

2474
01:47:38,991 --> 01:47:43,991
What was it like headlining after three 
years because I did a little bit of 

2475
01:47:43,991 --> 01:47:46,160
that,
but I had um,

2476
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:48,560
I had a manager who was like a really 
good.

2477
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:53,680
When I got my manager when I was about 
three years in and I headlined a bunch 

2478
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:55,470
of places where I really did not deserve
what.

2479
01:47:55,580 --> 01:47:58,640
He got me a bunch of gigs and I.
But I didn't have any pressure on me the

2480
01:47:58,641 --> 01:48:03,200
way you did winning last comic standing.
I was just sort of just starting out.

2481
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:07,840
So you go on this tour right after the 
last comic standing I think,

2482
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:13,160
Oh my God,
I could've been doing that much time 

2483
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:13,160
because there was like four of us.
So I just close it out.

2484
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:14,610
Um,
how much time you think you're doing?

2485
01:48:15,330 --> 01:48:16,530
I want to say 15,
20,

2486
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:21,980
you know?
And so you finished that and it's 

2487
01:48:21,980 --> 01:48:21,980
interesting because you,
when something like that and it's like,

2488
01:48:21,980 --> 01:48:23,100
okay,
figure it out now.

2489
01:48:23,410 --> 01:48:24,630
Right.
Sink or swim.

2490
01:48:24,690 --> 01:48:29,690
And some people sang,
some people swim after winning that 

2491
01:48:29,690 --> 01:48:29,690
show.
Most.

2492
01:48:29,690 --> 01:48:29,690
Sorry.
Most sank.

2493
01:48:29,690 --> 01:48:30,780
And I,
that being said,

2494
01:48:30,781 --> 01:48:35,781
you get some of these guys already had 
careers like John have fron was alonzo 

2495
01:48:35,781 --> 01:48:38,901
boat and like they're good and they were
fine and they do fine as both those 

2496
01:48:40,681 --> 01:48:42,930
guys.
I just kind of scraped together what you

2497
01:48:42,931 --> 01:48:44,310
have.
Even on the tour,

2498
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:47,040
I don't know if I was always the best 
one of the night,

2499
01:48:47,041 --> 01:48:49,670
but people are still there to see you or
their favorite one.

2500
01:48:49,670 --> 01:48:52,830
So you're just coming from this sort of 
scared.

2501
01:48:52,890 --> 01:48:55,260
But also you have confidence but also 
humble place of like,

2502
01:48:55,470 --> 01:48:57,150
I hope that I can stretch this.
It's enough.

2503
01:48:57,510 --> 01:49:00,630
And so you have about 45 minutes,
at least I did when you were done,

2504
01:49:00,660 --> 01:49:02,370
when a,
when you're ready to headline.

2505
01:49:03,210 --> 01:49:07,440
And I think that's a lot of the energy 
that I put toward it was like,

2506
01:49:07,650 --> 01:49:09,680
I'm just going to talk really,
really fast that way if you don't laugh,

2507
01:49:09,700 --> 01:49:10,950
doesn't matter.
You don't know you didn't like because I

2508
01:49:10,951 --> 01:49:15,360
got another joke right here and that has
sort of become a style for now.

2509
01:49:15,390 --> 01:49:18,480
Now it's not about a fear,
it's more of I'm so excited to talk.

2510
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:24,440
We did.
Me and some other comics did this Ray 

2511
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:27,030
Romano charity event a couple of weeks 
ago and Mark Marin was on it with me and

2512
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:30,300
we went downstairs to watch ray to Kinda
hear what the crowd sounded like.

2513
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:32,910
And so he was doing well and mark turns 
to me,

2514
01:49:33,120 --> 01:49:34,770
this is the funniest thing ever.
And he goes,

2515
01:49:34,771 --> 01:49:35,790
they're fine.
I go,

2516
01:49:35,791 --> 01:49:36,450
yeah,
they're good.

2517
01:49:36,690 --> 01:49:37,440
He goes,
you'll be fine.

2518
01:49:37,441 --> 01:49:38,010
I go,
yeah.

2519
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:39,360
He goes,
just do what you always do.

2520
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:41,820
Steam roll over the crowd.
Don't wait for applause,

2521
01:49:41,821 --> 01:49:45,930
dear voices and get off stage.
And I almost cried from laughing because

2522
01:49:45,931 --> 01:49:48,100
it was like no one ever breaks my balls 
like that.

2523
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:50,650
And it's true.
I do that.

2524
01:49:50,890 --> 01:49:53,440
And that's from that competitive 
situation,

2525
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:58,680
like that sort of energy.
Well you have the hard hard ass exterior

2526
01:49:58,900 --> 01:50:03,730
so I don't think a lot of people take a 
chance on breaking your balls,

2527
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:09,240
which is a shame because I think it's 
like the best way to show that you love 

2528
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:12,901
someone and it's the best way to know 
that somebody loves you is if they do 

2529
01:50:12,901 --> 01:50:17,821
that,
you can tell the intention that shield 

2530
01:50:17,821 --> 01:50:18,460
also keeps you from getting harassed by 
creeps to.

2531
01:50:18,610 --> 01:50:20,890
They don't believe they can get away 
with it maybe.

2532
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:22,690
And that's fine.
I think so for sure.

2533
01:50:22,691 --> 01:50:23,550
Right.
I mean,

2534
01:50:23,590 --> 01:50:27,490
I'm sure you've been harassed,
but I think if you were more vulnerable,

2535
01:50:27,491 --> 01:50:29,770
you've probably been harassed more.
Maybe.

2536
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:35,160
I don't know.
I mean you try not to give people a 

2537
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:35,160
chance.
You know,

2538
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:35,160
you're at a meet and greet after you're 
seeing your fans.

2539
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:37,810
And especially after I was talking about
with other comics.

2540
01:50:37,811 --> 01:50:39,280
But yeah,
after for sure.

2541
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:40,090
Oh,
with other comics,

2542
01:50:40,210 --> 01:50:45,210
I think with other comics,
I know you win the show three years in 

2543
01:50:45,210 --> 01:50:46,990
and then you're at a certain level of 
kind of a level.

2544
01:50:46,991 --> 01:50:51,991
All by myself,
I didn't have a lot of other women I 

2545
01:50:51,991 --> 01:50:53,050
related to because no one else was out 
there that I didn't know any other women

2546
01:50:53,550 --> 01:50:55,950
you're kinda lonely out there.
Um,

2547
01:50:56,290 --> 01:50:59,980
and so I would look up to people like 
you and I consider myself a colleague of

2548
01:50:59,981 --> 01:51:02,080
yours now,
but at the time I was just like,

2549
01:51:02,110 --> 01:51:03,040
what,
how do I,

2550
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:05,110
you're so much higher than me,
you know?

2551
01:51:05,630 --> 01:51:07,150
Um,
and I didn't know you.

2552
01:51:07,151 --> 01:51:09,040
I didn't know any of these guys.
So it's just,

2553
01:51:10,330 --> 01:51:15,330
I dunno,
I don't think any of the comics would 

2554
01:51:15,330 --> 01:51:15,330
step to me because they were,
you not around comics a lot.

2555
01:51:15,330 --> 01:51:18,490
I don't remember when we met.
I think I knew we knew each other.

2556
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:20,470
Like it took time.
I was always at the store,

2557
01:51:20,471 --> 01:51:25,471
but I mean I think it was just,
I think you were around though in the 

2558
01:51:25,471 --> 01:51:30,450
days that I wasn't at the store level.
What year did you win last comic 

2559
01:51:30,450 --> 01:51:30,450
standing?
Two thousand eight.

2560
01:51:30,450 --> 01:51:31,540
Yeah.
See I wasn't there then.

2561
01:51:31,660 --> 01:51:32,560
Yeah,
you weren't there,

2562
01:51:33,220 --> 01:51:34,810
but obviously everyone knew who you 
were.

2563
01:51:35,530 --> 01:51:40,530
It's weird.
I was talking to Steve Simone about 

2564
01:51:40,530 --> 01:51:40,530
this.
There are people,

2565
01:51:40,530 --> 01:51:43,381
you know your whole career,
but you may not start talking to them 

2566
01:51:43,381 --> 01:51:44,410
until recently and then it's as if you 
were always friends.

2567
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:47,740
So now I consider myself like an 
upperclassman there.

2568
01:51:48,670 --> 01:51:53,670
I'm also,
I really tried to just be kind to the 

2569
01:51:53,670 --> 01:51:56,791
other comics door guys,
younger comics I've always given and 

2570
01:51:56,791 --> 01:52:00,001
you're like this too.
It gives someone the time of day if 

2571
01:52:00,001 --> 01:52:00,001
you're going to be respectful and nice.

2572
01:52:00,001 --> 01:52:01,960
I have no problem giving it back.
You know a lot of those door guys,

2573
01:52:02,260 --> 01:52:07,260
like guys who started out as door guys,
Duncan and Ra are two of my best 

2574
01:52:07,260 --> 01:52:08,230
friends.
They were both door guys.

2575
01:52:08,260 --> 01:52:09,490
It's a lot of people started as door 
guys.

2576
01:52:09,550 --> 01:52:13,510
Jessica Wellington was the only girl and
I have her come feature for me.

2577
01:52:13,511 --> 01:52:18,511
She did my show last night.
That's the kind of girl that needs a 

2578
01:52:18,511 --> 01:52:21,151
chance because she is like in a boy's 
club within a boys club because I work 

2579
01:52:21,151 --> 01:52:22,450
with men.
She's a door guy,

2580
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:27,600
she's a girl,
so it's all dudes and she's at a store 

2581
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:27,600
at the store.
Um,

2582
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:29,140
and I was like,
someone needs to be nice to this girl,

2583
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:31,660
a fucking shitty job.
It's tough,

2584
01:52:32,110 --> 01:52:34,660
but you're around comedy all the time.
I mean,

2585
01:52:34,661 --> 01:52:39,661
you're,
you're at the world series of comedy on 

2586
01:52:39,661 --> 01:52:39,760
a daily basis.
I mean,

2587
01:52:39,790 --> 01:52:44,790
imagine you're a cover booth person,
you get a chance to sit there and watch 

2588
01:52:44,790 --> 01:52:45,830
some of the best shows.
Holy Shit,

2589
01:52:45,831 --> 01:52:46,310
Dave Chappelle

2590
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:47,660
just showed up.
Holy Fuck.

2591
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:52,840
And you're sitting there from that cover
booth watching Dave Chappelle and he 

2592
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:53,030
brings most def on stage with them or 
something like that.

2593
01:52:53,470 --> 01:52:55,220
That shit happens there all the time.
Oh my God.

2594
01:52:55,221 --> 01:52:58,820
He's bringing up Chris Rock.
Your fucking head's ready to explode.

2595
01:52:59,110 --> 01:53:04,110
And I mean there's a,
there's a reality of work in there that 

2596
01:53:04,110 --> 01:53:05,240
doesn't exist anywhere else to go over 
the laugh factory,

2597
01:53:07,030 --> 01:53:08,870
you know,
you ain't getting that fucking reality.

2598
01:53:09,070 --> 01:53:11,860
Ucla standup comic showcase night.
Cool.

2599
01:53:12,570 --> 01:53:16,960
That place can burn.
I get very protective.

2600
01:53:17,530 --> 01:53:19,690
I told you what you know,
you know why I say that,

2601
01:53:19,691 --> 01:53:21,120
right?
You know about this right now.

2602
01:53:21,180 --> 01:53:23,530
There's a bunch of Shit I could tell you
things to van.

2603
01:53:23,590 --> 01:53:27,070
From there I am banned from the laugh 
factory,

2604
01:53:27,071 --> 01:53:29,380
a club that I've been a regular at 
forever.

2605
01:53:29,381 --> 01:53:31,540
I've told you the story.
I won't repeat it if I told them to you.

2606
01:53:31,541 --> 01:53:32,440
Boy,
you told it to me,

2607
01:53:32,441 --> 01:53:37,441
but it's fine.
I started going there under the idea 

2608
01:53:37,441 --> 01:53:42,121
that I should support the club because I
don't want it to go under and then I 

2609
01:53:42,121 --> 01:53:43,620
don't want it to go under it.
That's so sad.

2610
01:53:43,660 --> 01:53:45,620
Why I found out they record all your 
sets.

2611
01:53:46,450 --> 01:53:49,120
Uh,
I will say that I get,

2612
01:53:49,150 --> 01:53:50,590
you know,
the store is.

2613
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:55,740
I always say that the comedy store,
the or in particular is like an abusive 

2614
01:53:55,740 --> 01:53:56,410
boyfriend.
Like you're like,

2615
01:53:56,411 --> 01:53:57,760
this hurts.
Oh my God.

2616
01:53:57,761 --> 01:53:59,410
And then when you don't go for a while,
you're like,

2617
01:53:59,411 --> 01:54:00,760
I need you.
I need.

2618
01:54:00,761 --> 01:54:05,761
It's like Stockholm Syndrome training.
It's like doing a set with a giant 

2619
01:54:05,761 --> 01:54:06,650
weight vest on.
It's like swinging two bats

2620
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:09,380
times.
It's great if you can,

2621
01:54:09,770 --> 01:54:14,770
if you can compete or hang rather in 
that environment you can go anywhere 

2622
01:54:15,171 --> 01:54:16,330
else you'd be killing.

2623
01:54:16,410 --> 01:54:17,880
It's so true.
And you know,

2624
01:54:17,881 --> 01:54:22,881
you get comics that kind of get the vibe
of the store from a couple of years ago 

2625
01:54:22,881 --> 01:54:23,820
when it wasn't the friendliest place and
it has that reputation.

2626
01:54:24,240 --> 01:54:29,240
But I take great solace in knowing that 
like my home is an intimidating 

2627
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:33,051
environment and I love whatever space 
I've carved out there and I don't take 

2628
01:54:33,051 --> 01:54:37,581
it for granted and I try to respect the 
shows and respect the audience and you 

2629
01:54:37,581 --> 01:54:39,630
know,
I'm so proud to be a store comic.

2630
01:54:39,660 --> 01:54:41,820
It's not the kindness of lovers all the 
time.

2631
01:54:42,150 --> 01:54:47,150
It's not always the most supportive,
but I'm very proud of that upbringing 

2632
01:54:47,150 --> 01:54:49,140
because that's,
that storm made me the comic that I am,

2633
01:54:49,141 --> 01:54:50,580
that our,
you know,

2634
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:55,920
um,
the main room where it's all Swedish 

2635
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:57,741
tourist and you're like,
he does not want me to talk and it just 

2636
01:54:57,741 --> 01:54:58,200
makes you so you can go anywhere in 
comic shit on it.

2637
01:54:58,200 --> 01:55:00,690
And I'm like,
you just sound jealous because you can't

2638
01:55:00,691 --> 01:55:05,691
hang shits on the stove all the time.
I didn't say that.

2639
01:55:05,821 --> 01:55:09,450
It's just a regular comics you did.
It's just they don't like it.

2640
01:55:09,700 --> 01:55:14,700
It's because they don't like bombing.
But anybody who makes fun of something 

2641
01:55:14,700 --> 01:55:14,700
that you're afraid of.
Yeah.

2642
01:55:14,700 --> 01:55:19,190
Well then there's things to make fun of 
just because they saw bombing there 

2643
01:55:19,190 --> 01:55:20,580
feels so good though.
Like it's like pushing into a bruise.

2644
01:55:20,581 --> 01:55:21,180
You're like,
yes,

2645
01:55:21,181 --> 01:55:22,690
I need this.
Oh,

2646
01:55:22,830 --> 01:55:27,830
interesting.
Well you've got a good attitude about 

2647
01:55:27,830 --> 01:55:27,830
it.
I still did the Improv.

2648
01:55:27,830 --> 01:55:27,830
I'm doing the improv tonight.
Yeah.

2649
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:29,980
And is cool.
The store's got it.

2650
01:55:29,981 --> 01:55:31,690
So there's something about it though.
Yeah,

2651
01:55:31,810 --> 01:55:33,630
there's a grittiness to it.
I'm very proud of it.

2652
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:35,850
And the Improv's never been anything but
lovely to me.

2653
01:55:35,851 --> 01:55:40,851
It was the first club I got past that.
It's still great club and the Comedy 

2654
01:55:40,851 --> 01:55:40,860
Union.
Fucking stupid piano off the stage.

2655
01:55:41,010 --> 01:55:44,100
Oh my God.
And they see behind

2656
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:45,200
it,
behind the fucking pain.

2657
01:55:45,250 --> 01:55:47,400
I apologize to those people.
Every time I'm like,

2658
01:55:47,480 --> 01:55:52,480
I someone send them a drink because you 
can only see my feet and what have you 

2659
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:53,040
have to do something physical and you're
doing it behind the piano.

2660
01:55:53,160 --> 01:55:54,930
So for the one time Owen Benjamin drops 
in.

2661
01:55:54,931 --> 01:55:56,310
We have a whole piano.
Exactly.

2662
01:55:56,311 --> 01:55:57,330
That's what I told Owen.
I said,

2663
01:55:57,331 --> 01:55:58,650
you need to bring your own fucking 
piano.

2664
01:55:58,651 --> 01:56:01,020
You and Craig Robinson bring a keyboard,
asshole.

2665
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:06,440
What the fuck?
It's just like one of those old school 

2666
01:56:06,440 --> 01:56:06,440
things that nobody ever got rid of.
I think.

2667
01:56:06,620 --> 01:56:11,620
I mean,
there's a lot of things to talk to them 

2668
01:56:11,620 --> 01:56:11,620
into it.
You think that was luck?

2669
01:56:11,620 --> 01:56:15,260
That would change the world.
What do to send the email to make the 

2670
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:15,260
club way better?
I know people.

2671
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:17,310
I got some email addresses I could send 
you love talking about this offline.

2672
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:19,710
We're going to talk about a bunch of 
things offline.

2673
01:56:19,711 --> 01:56:24,711
I will.
I need to remember all the different 

2674
01:56:24,711 --> 01:56:24,711
people that said fucked up things to you
that you don't want to say.

2675
01:56:24,711 --> 01:56:26,130
Have a name on the tip of my tongue.
I'm going to say it the second way.

2676
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:27,630
Turn it off.
I can't wait.

2677
01:56:27,631 --> 01:56:29,820
Let's wrap it up now.
So your book,

2678
01:56:30,360 --> 01:56:33,540
let's we can wrap it up now.
I'm a [inaudible] girl.

2679
01:56:33,541 --> 01:56:35,100
Logic avail.
Available right now.

2680
01:56:35,101 --> 01:56:38,310
Probably the last Harvey Weinstein 
approved book ever.

2681
01:56:38,460 --> 01:56:39,310
Yeah,
right.

2682
01:56:39,450 --> 01:56:40,780
I wrote you something on this.
You.

2683
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:41,990
Yeah.
I won't read it though.

2684
01:56:42,090 --> 01:56:43,530
It's very small.
I don't want to be A.

2685
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:47,090
I don't want to tear up.
Please buy my book to go buy her book.

2686
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:50,130
You fucks and go see her on tour.
She's very funny.

2687
01:56:50,370 --> 01:56:53,960
And where are you at?
Where can people get your tour dates and

2688
01:56:54,660 --> 01:56:55,380
nonstop.

2689
01:56:55,380 --> 01:57:00,380
So go to [inaudible] dot com and we just
announced my fourth netflix special is 

2690
01:57:00,380 --> 01:57:01,710
going to be on the USS Hornet off the 
coast of San Francisco.

2691
01:57:01,711 --> 01:57:06,711
In the bay.
You're going to stand up special on a 

2692
01:57:06,711 --> 01:57:06,810
boat on a aircraft carrier.
Holy Shit.

2693
01:57:06,860 --> 01:57:08,730
Well you announced it today.
That's bad ass.

2694
01:57:08,731 --> 01:57:13,731
Have you ever done it before?
Have you ever performed on an aircraft 

2695
01:57:13,731 --> 01:57:16,761
carrier?
I did on the SS dentists in the Persian 

2696
01:57:16,761 --> 01:57:17,100
Gulf on a Uso tour.
So Holy Shit,

2697
01:57:17,101 --> 01:57:22,101
I stole the idea.
That's a great idea to do a special 

2698
01:57:22,101 --> 01:57:22,101
there.
Whoa.

2699
01:57:22,101 --> 01:57:22,440
You're going to wear the red,
white and Blue Bikini.

2700
01:57:22,530 --> 01:57:25,510
I think I might just wear a white body 
suit or a cammo bodysuit cam.

2701
01:57:25,620 --> 01:57:27,420
Oh No,
I'm talking like that.

2702
01:57:27,421 --> 01:57:28,410
I liked that.
I like that.

2703
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:29,910
Alright,
thank you Eliza.

2704
01:57:29,940 --> 01:57:31,500
Thanks.
We'll see you tomorrow.

2705
01:57:31,501 --> 01:57:32,280
You fucks.
