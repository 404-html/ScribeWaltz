1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:03,063
Okay.

2
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,950
Podcast is brought to you
by the flashlight. If you're
going to Joe rogan.net,

3
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,190
click on the link for the fleshlight
and entering the code named Rogan.

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,430
You will get 15% off a $1 one sex
toy from this wonky ass set up.

5
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,230
I can never get these fucking cameras
to stay straight. There you go.

6
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:32,310
Fill a
flashlight.

7
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:36,090
Commercial done. That's it. No,
I'll give you a little more.

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,960
It's a fucking great product to an
embarrassing product, but it's excellent.

9
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,060
It's very effective for what it does.

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,750
Oh these things are going to
be on a space station soon.

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,310
I've got $100 they should
be on the space station.

12
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:50,250
Why should they make those people just
stay up in space and not be able to fuck

13
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:53,520
a little, not to mention like
jerking off in space. Yeah.

14
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:55,920
I feel like strictly prohibited
from having sex up there.

15
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,590
Well yeah cause you're going to have
your come floating through the space

16
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:02,070
station. This is why the flashlight's
great out there cause it catches your jet.

17
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:06,600
That's right. Perfect for the space
station. It's American, it's NASA,

18
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:07,930
it's fucking NASA.

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,080
NASA type technology and it's the best
feeling false. With Johnny, you can get,

20
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:18,730
well I shouldn't even say false
artificial or would you say false?

21
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,560
Why wouldn't I?
Because it makes me feel bad.

22
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,250
I'm judging the fishes
better. Some false. It's,

23
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:32,240
it's a rule of fake one. It's definitely
feels like you're fucking her pussy.

24
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,910
A really good one too.
And a dead one.

25
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,530
Especially if you go out of your
way when you could make it warm.

26
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,600
I don't do that.
Anytime I'm about a flashlight.

27
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,540
It's I'm way past eating out for thing.

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,950
How often do you prepare and
actually like lay out some water.

29
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,650
He a bath with the flashlight and the
Bab so it soaks in the warm water and

30
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:58,500
you'd have to figure out what's, what's
realistic. It's 100 degrees realistic.

31
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,530
Are you fucking a girl with a fever?

32
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,080
A marathon runner? A girl.
Mid Marathon. But I did.

33
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:10,730
I did it once. I did try to heat
up a flashlight. I was like,

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,320
I'm gonna fucking,
I put it under the sink and turn it up,

35
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,810
turn the water on hot and just let the
hot water. It's the same thing. We like,

36
00:02:17,811 --> 00:02:19,100
fuck this,
I'm fucking this thing.

37
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,880
You have to poach it slightly.
We'll temperature.

38
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,170
What if you had like a,

39
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,200
like a crazy fetish for banging a
chip that's dying of fever and shit.

40
00:02:32,441 --> 00:02:35,080
The one last thing,
she wants you to fucker malaria.

41
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,340
It's just so hot and sweaty and she just
shaking and last last gasps of air and

42
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,980
her favorite thing is fucking so
she was like, just fuck me. Yeah.

43
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,700
You would fly to villages in Africa that
were like afflicted with malaria and

44
00:02:49,701 --> 00:02:52,850
you would go there and pay the
villagers money to let them fuck.

45
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,630
You know, it's fucked up. As
fucked up as that. Dawn is.

46
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,690
Someone out there has it
legitimately, you know, there's,

47
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:09,310
there's 7 billion of us now. How
many people on it? I don't know.

48
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:10,180
I lost count.

49
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,210
We also brought to you by [inaudible]
Dot com o n n I t, makers of Alpha brain.

50
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,780
I take my Alpha brain before the show.
Let's see if I fall apart.

51
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,580
I take it before anything important.
What is it? It's a, it's a neutral beck.

52
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,710
I take it every day essentially,
but I make sure I take it,

53
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,480
but like before I beat to the UFC,

54
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:34,660
I take three or four of them before I do
comedy and take three or four of them.

55
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,230
Usually I only take like two in a day,
maybe four.

56
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:43,490
But what it is is a nootropics are, and
by the way, this is just me. I mean it's,

57
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:45,670
it's not dangerous yet.
None of these levels of dangerous,

58
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:48,730
but you might not like it.
You might think it makes you too jittery.

59
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,620
I've had like I've taken three
before in a row and I'm like, man,

60
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:55,060
this makes me feel like a little edgy.

61
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,650
Almost like I'm caffeine down a little
bit, but usually two, two is good.

62
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,070
Two is good for stand up,
two's good for anything.

63
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,420
Anything intense is going to take
more than four or five hours,

64
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,490
usually take three. Nowadays they
also seem to combat hangovers.

65
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,230
It's great for jet lag too.

66
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,200
We'll do whatever the fuck's going on
in your brain when it's not working that

67
00:04:14,201 --> 00:04:18,490
well. Obviously there's a lack of
something. What is that? I Dunno,

68
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,320
but these,
these nutrients,

69
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:25,340
supposedly the science behind it is that
it helps your body produce human neuro

70
00:04:25,341 --> 00:04:28,750
transmitters in May. It helps
you produce all the, you know,

71
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:32,830
all the shit that makes your brain fire.
Yeah. It's, what's that stuff called?

72
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:33,960
It's called [inaudible]

73
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,250
doesn't it have, what's the shit you
take after you take ecstasy the next day?

74
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,030
Oh yeah, I be five HTP
is a nootropic. Yeah,

75
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,660
that's the thing we have called new mood.

76
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,080
Five HTP m also El Tryptofan because
ultra defend converts to five HTP and the

77
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:55,130
body and that enhances your body's
ability to produce serotonin. Yeah.

78
00:04:55,131 --> 00:04:59,330
There's ways you can manipulate the levels
of nutrients in your body and it has

79
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:01,640
an effect,
a real effect on the way your brain works.

80
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,650
But don't just listen to me please Google
nootropics and there's a lot of other

81
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,710
companies out there that
have real good products.

82
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,360
I mentioned Bill Graham
analyses and neuro one.

83
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:15,980
I liked that one a lot and it's got like
a little caffeine in it. Um, if she,

84
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,580
at least mine. Really? Yeah.
What's it called? Pain at brain.

85
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:26,200
The them, the guy jerks off logo and
sharks. These responsibilities makes

86
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,710
it so that you can easily share gear
with spot without feeling guilty.

87
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:34,870
Like before I would play world for like
four hours straight and I feel terrible.

88
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,250
Now I'm Beta brain.

89
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,760
I can play world of Warcraft for
two days straight shit myself.

90
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:45,700
Shred them guilt. It's great stuff guys.
You compartmentalize essentially. Yeah,

91
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:48,340
you can't, you just don't feel
the guilt. You just let it go.

92
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:51,120
The guilt just gets blocked.
It's gone wrong. Naps.

93
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,460
You could jerk off five times a day
without feeling like a loser on Beta.

94
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:57,980
Brain waves break, check it out. We'll
be, we'll be looking into that as well.

95
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,780
If you're interested in alphabet,
Joe rugged.net, click on the link,

96
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:07,220
enter in the code name Rogan and you will
get 10% off any and all orders. We're,

97
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,910
we're absolutely not trying to rip anybody
off with any of this stuff and that's

98
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:15,911
the reason why we have a 100% money
back guarantee on the first order of 30

99
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:19,730
pills. When you buy it, if you ride it,
you don't even have to send it back.

100
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:22,070
Just so this stuff sucks.
Give me my money back.

101
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:24,350
We are now trying to rip anybody off.

102
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:29,351
This is all stuff I would be taken whether
or not I had any financial stake in

103
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:30,320
the company.

104
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,160
Uh, with Beta brain, I have frank,

105
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,880
no financial stake in the company and
with the first 50 pills you order,

106
00:06:35,881 --> 00:06:38,110
you get a lavender scented face mask.

107
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,050
It should be with Beta brain
for the first, you know,

108
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,940
first three years of the company.

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,250
All of the money goes to
all of your ex's anyway.

110
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,130
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah. It's flowers. Yeah.

111
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,380
Could you imagine if that was
the way the world works? If you,

112
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,400
you entered into contracts and
you know, as you, as you left,

113
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:02,630
like you would have to agree to be with
this woman or pay for this one for 10

114
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,780
years and then don't have sex with you.

115
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,400
What if is what's just with friendship?

116
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,660
What if you had to get married to your
friend and being friends with people you

117
00:07:10,661 --> 00:07:13,740
have to like sign a contract with like
we're going to be friends forever.

118
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,900
Yeah. And you can't just miss miss
him on a weekend once or twice.

119
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,220
You gotta do what I'm constantly,

120
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:19,750
no,

121
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,470
and if you fucking break that contract
that you got to keep your friend like 10%

122
00:07:23,471 --> 00:07:24,304
of your anchor.

123
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,060
I bet people have done,

124
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,120
I mean isn't that what gay marriage as
essentially it's just friends or fuck

125
00:07:30,121 --> 00:07:31,260
each other cause they're dudes.

126
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,760
I think that's what marriage is,
right? Yeah. Fuck each other.

127
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:39,140
That's why having a girlfriend is, it's
a friend that you fuck, right girl.

128
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:40,580
I took our old friend,
that's how they call it.

129
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:45,020
It's just a friend that you like to put
your Dick inside of what it is. Yeah,

130
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,610
absolutely. So now that act of doing that
at the moment you put your cock inside,

131
00:07:49,611 --> 00:07:52,210
somebody changes the game. Yeah. Oh

132
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,663
yeah.

133
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,720
Anyway, enough about Alpha
brain talk. That commercial,

134
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,770
it's essentially over right now. Well,
there's new mood, shroom tech, sport,

135
00:08:04,771 --> 00:08:05,340
True Tech,

136
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,870
Moon and Alpha brain and all the
different things that we saw it on it.

137
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,880
O N N I t.com coming up,

138
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:15,630
we got kettlebells and a bunch
of other cool nutritional things.

139
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,560
You know, Beta brain also has a mood
enhancing drug. It's called blue mode.

140
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,530
It makes it so that you can like
really listen to Elliot Smith. Love it.

141
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,260
I wonder if the,
if the,

142
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:31,500
if someone could sell pills that made
you depressed and he would buy him,

143
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,930
he would buy them.
I mean,

144
00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:35,780
look at what it's cigarettes
once or something that
makes you feel like shit and

145
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:39,590
smelled terrible. And yet there
though, like it's super popular.

146
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,390
Kills people and it's super popular.

147
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,340
If you had depression pills and
you just had them out there, yeah,

148
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,560
it would be like a news story.

149
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:49,820
News at five is this new
pill crossing the line.

150
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,710
It's marketed as depression.

151
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,440
And then you go there and there's a chick
with white makeup on a black lipstick

152
00:08:55,441 --> 00:08:59,640
and she goes, life fucking sucks.
It's always fucking sucked. Okay.

153
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,720
And when I take these pills, I see Audi
and that's what I want. If you are, I get,

154
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:05,420
fuck. Yeah. Yeah.

155
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,670
What is wrong with the children of today
is this depression drug crossing the

156
00:09:11,131 --> 00:09:11,670
line.

157
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,200
Happiness is annoying when
you're around happy people,

158
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,220
they're fucking irritating. If you're
happier fucking piece of shit. Yeah.

159
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,940
What are you,
what's there to be happy about?

160
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:24,720
You're going to fucking die in a few
years. Russian wars raging everywhere.

161
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:28,200
You really going to walk around with
a smile on your face and this economy.

162
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,720
Well no,
it's really good to do.

163
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:35,040
Depression was your girl cause when
you get through it and it wears off,

164
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,650
it's like he gets a really
appreciate how good.

165
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,880
How could you have it right when
you're getting along great. Yeah,

166
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,210
because when you take depression,

167
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,200
it's really like going through like
one of those life changing experiences.

168
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:50,310
I'm mood African drugs that make you
like almost die and then we have a

169
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:52,440
combination of those crazy
drugs that they give,

170
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,380
like the jungle drugs
where you almost die.

171
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,380
It's not quite a psychedelic experience.

172
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:01,890
It's almost like a near death
experience. Like, literally,

173
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,360
literally am most kill you ready?
Cool.

174
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,370
And you're supposed to like learn
something about yourself through,

175
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,260
through this intense
and horrible poisoning.

176
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:15,270
I think they're called ordeal
poisons. That's the actual
technical term. And they,

177
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:19,910
um, they, they operate very similar to
psychedelics in the way that they humbly,

178
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:23,040
you mean, cause it really brings
you to the brink of death and your,

179
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:28,230
your emotions are just
blaring your fuse are blaring,

180
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:30,510
your, you know, insecurities.
And when, you know,

181
00:10:30,511 --> 00:10:34,860
I think you're forced to examine your
life in a very deep and realistic way in

182
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:38,700
any real, true near tragic
situation. Right? Oh yeah.

183
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,050
So I think you take these ordeal poisons
and you just go through the ordeal of

184
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:47,180
almost fucking dying and you learned a
little bit about yourself, but God dammit,

185
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,360
that's the hard way to do it.

186
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,520
That is the hard way to do it.
But for a lot of people,

187
00:10:50,521 --> 00:10:51,600
that's the only way to do it.
Yeah.

188
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,900
Yeah. They don't have enough love
in a psychedelic free environment.

189
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,510
I can't get it to them. So they don't
have the means to get it to them.

190
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,420
Yeah. I mean sometimes even, I mean,

191
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,430
people will take psychedelics
and still be douche bags.

192
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,450
Totally. That guy we were talking
about before a show. Yeah.

193
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,680
It was a lot of them out there,
but they're like,

194
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:17,270
it's almost like by taking it and allows
you to be a Twat because you've had the

195
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:22,260
experience and you're allowed to
like stick it in someone else's face.

196
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:26,310
It hasn't had the experience of their,
their children or their a moron.

197
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,510
Like that's, that's, that's crazy.
What are, you know, you're not,

198
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,040
you're not better for having an
experience. You're just more experienced.

199
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,820
You know, what, what's better is
your overall impact on human beings.

200
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,451
And if Justin,

201
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:42,870
your accumulated some extra information
so you feel it's okay to be conti,

202
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,460
well that's not better at all.

203
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,600
You just moved your energy into a
different direction. You're not,

204
00:11:47,601 --> 00:11:50,130
you're not better. Right.
You're still being a Twat.

205
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:55,010
Well, you're still differentiating.
Yeah. That's it. That's the, the,

206
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,580
um,
and the Bhagavad of I get,

207
00:11:56,581 --> 00:12:00,370
it sort of talks about like signs of
people who've gained real realization.

208
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,610
And one of the signs is that they don't
differentiate between any anything.

209
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:10,180
It's all, they see it as all an
expansion of the same original force.

210
00:12:10,181 --> 00:12:12,700
They don't see it anymore.
It's like this person's rich,

211
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,900
this is person or this person's good, this
person's bad. It's all just different,

212
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:21,460
uh,
sides and angles and this super structure,

213
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,080
there's a existed

214
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,650
forever. That's so hard
to do, to think that way.

215
00:12:25,651 --> 00:12:28,370
It's so hard to separate yourself from,
you know,

216
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,570
from you and your needs and your,

217
00:12:30,571 --> 00:12:34,040
your ideas are you what you want and
what you want to accomplish or what or

218
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:34,740
whatever.
Yeah.

219
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:39,030
Whenever you associate with you and
the idea that you're a part of a whole,

220
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:43,070
well, you could end up actually
imagine it really being in that state.

221
00:12:43,071 --> 00:12:47,140
The only time I've ever truly
been in that state was, uh,

222
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:52,150
when I had taken a huge dose of
Lsd and was out in the desert.

223
00:12:52,341 --> 00:12:57,280
And I remember just having that fading
away merging thing where you no longer

224
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,950
anything. You're just, you're, you're
everything. You just merge into it all.

225
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,490
And I don't know how you would
really function in that state.

226
00:13:04,491 --> 00:13:07,760
I don't really know what you would
be like in the world if he, if,

227
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:12,520
if you've got didn't, if that lasted
longer than the amount of time, you know,

228
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:14,450
an acid trip is or a few hours.

229
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,820
But they do say that through
meditation and through, um,

230
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,620
strict yoga disciplines,

231
00:13:21,621 --> 00:13:26,000
you can hit that place permanently,
you know,

232
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:30,200
and somehow that that place
is Nirvana or paradise.

233
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:34,910
It's a beautiful way to be all the
time. But I don't know. I haven't,

234
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,271
you know,

235
00:13:35,271 --> 00:13:39,650
I've only heard stories about people like
that descriptions and people like, uh,

236
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:44,740
he was a corpse that the universe spoke
through as one great description of wow.

237
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,510
You know, or the, the, the
ego of the person was dead.

238
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,800
They're just gone.

239
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,140
But that would probably boring as fuck
to hang out with cus the problem. Right.

240
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:57,880
You know,

241
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,350
part of what's cool about being a human
being is being around people that have

242
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:03,070
some flavor.

243
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,690
Yeah. Hell yeah. And you, you know,

244
00:14:04,691 --> 00:14:08,140
you see some of these people and they
do seem to have flavor. So, you know, I,

245
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:12,310
I don't know the problem with talking
about the holy men of the world,

246
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:17,220
the great holy man, if the world is
that I've never met one. It's like

247
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,110
I've met some want to be gurus,

248
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:24,460
quite a few want to be gurus
and some of them, you know,

249
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,500
they shock me with they're humorless.

250
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:31,880
You know what though dude, I did do a
video chat with Ron Bass. You still,

251
00:14:31,881 --> 00:14:34,230
there was a man, that guy was
fucking awesome and it lit up.

252
00:14:34,231 --> 00:14:37,320
My whole apartment was just you and
him. Yeah, it was, no, it was me,

253
00:14:37,321 --> 00:14:39,630
him and Natasha. Wow. Yeah.

254
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,400
How did you arrange this?

255
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,520
Well,
on its website you can still do it.

256
00:14:43,521 --> 00:14:48,080
It's this thing called heart to hearts
where you can like know you can talk to

257
00:14:48,081 --> 00:14:51,350
him on Sunday. Wow. And you
just go to the website and up.

258
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,970
I couldn't believe it either.
I thought it was,

259
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,120
there was no way it was going to work
or I thought they were going to like try

260
00:14:56,121 --> 00:15:00,170
to get asked for money from
me or something like, but
I sign up for it Sunday,

261
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:03,560
my phone rang. Hello
Duncan. It's Ron doss.

262
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:04,710
Holy Shit.

263
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,560
Yeah. And then suddenly I'm like
on this video screen with Ron Doss,

264
00:15:08,561 --> 00:15:12,160
and he was glowing. He was like,
he's an old dude now that he's,

265
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,930
it was like exactly the same energy that
my friends, eight year old kids have.

266
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,760
It was just this radiant,
childlike, authentic energy.

267
00:15:21,761 --> 00:15:25,930
It wasn't phony. It wasn't bullshit. Wow.
We talked for a little while. He told me,

268
00:15:25,931 --> 00:15:26,764
um,

269
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,570
this chant that he's been doing lately
over and over again where he says,

270
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,380
I am loving awareness. I am loving
awareness. I am loving awareness.

271
00:15:35,381 --> 00:15:39,940
It's a chance to just sort of, I don't
know, shift your vibe. And then that was,

272
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:43,120
it said goodbye. And that was it.
They didn't ask for any money.

273
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,870
They didn't want anything. It
was just a wow, you know? Yeah.

274
00:15:46,871 --> 00:15:48,540
I was just like service.
That's okay.

275
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,270
That's fascinating. That's
fascinating. Yeah. It's like,

276
00:15:52,271 --> 00:15:55,130
look at him and you know, people who, uh,

277
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,470
are insane psychedelic enthusiasts.
You know,

278
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,870
you look at someone like him and you go,
there's a guy he made it through. Yes.

279
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,550
You made it through. I
really grabbed it. Yeah.

280
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,790
He really grabbed a hold of the whole
thing and it made him something different

281
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:10,300
and made him what he is at the,
at the heart of the trip.

282
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,870
That's right now. Well, he,

283
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:17,540
because what happened is he went into
that state and instead of going into that

284
00:16:18,451 --> 00:16:22,140
state and leaving and then that's it.
It was a novel experience.

285
00:16:22,141 --> 00:16:26,040
He went to that state and said,
I want to be in this state permanently.

286
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,620
What the fuck is this?
Cause he had, you know,

287
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:32,130
he's a trained psychologist and he's like,
we don't know what this is.

288
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,840
We don't have any maps for this.

289
00:16:33,841 --> 00:16:37,580
We don't know what the fuck this
psychedelic experiences and all I,

290
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,080
so he was trying to,
when you went to India,

291
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,660
he was trying to see if this was a
state that you could permanently reside.

292
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:48,840
He wanted to stay here forever. That's
how much he loved tripping. You know,

293
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:53,610
when I come down quite often I'm like,
thank you God, I'm back to, you know,

294
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,840
stay zero ground. I
mean, he was like, okay,

295
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,180
let's do this forever.

296
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,800
They weren't fucking with him and
Timothy weary word like drinking from

297
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:09,030
drinking,
sipping viles of acids from LSD.

298
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:14,430
You don't know, are you so fucking
deep into the accident, so scary,

299
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,260
fearless, fearless, intrepid
explorers, but he, you know,

300
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,990
he realized that you go into that place,

301
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:27,270
you have this contact or whatever you
want to call it with some kind of either

302
00:17:27,271 --> 00:17:32,271
hidden interior around or some kind
of exterior around that as humans.

303
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,090
Our perceptual neck.

304
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:37,110
Yeah man, that's a pretty scientific
way of looking at it. Realistically,

305
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,780
Interior Realm. Even being
just a conscious one, you
know, a consciousness realm.

306
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,450
You know the fact that those ideas there,
none of,

307
00:17:45,451 --> 00:17:47,550
why are they not
available to me right now?

308
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,190
This is if it's all
generated interiorly yeah.

309
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,730
How come those ideas are not
available to be right now?

310
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:58,590
Do I need some intense stimulation of
different regions in order to give me that

311
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:01,020
information?
Like I don't know how the process works.

312
00:18:01,021 --> 00:18:03,150
I'm not exactly sure if
other people know either.

313
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:08,300
I have the wound is fucking feeling that
when you take psychedelics or when you

314
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:13,881
take even marijuana that you are
part of what the experience is,

315
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,700
is you experiencing the
intelligence of the plant.

316
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,270
Part of it is it charged it.

317
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,450
It boosts up your own
senses into this weird,

318
00:18:23,451 --> 00:18:28,451
crazy alien state and that's why being
high feel so like disorienting and feels

319
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:33,420
like you're almost like
not in your space anymore.

320
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:38,040
You're space is connected with some
other intelligence and this other

321
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:41,520
intelligence is showing you different
avenues of thinking. It's almost like it,

322
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,150
it,

323
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:47,010
it starts filling pores in your mind
and pushing you in a certain direction

324
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:52,200
until it wears off and then it wears off
and it's alien to your system so your

325
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:54,120
body gets rid of it
eventually and then it's gone.

326
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,390
It only has a certain certain
amount of love time inside of you,

327
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,900
but while it's inside of you,
it's like it's changing you. It's,

328
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,360
it's making you like
super fucking sensitive.

329
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:07,470
It's making me super aware and honest, you
know? I mean, one, a lot of people say,

330
00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:09,270
well it doesn't need to be
where it just makes me paranoid.

331
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,790
Well maybe that's just
how you deal with stress.

332
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,740
Cause for sure you're going to get
moments if you smoke too much pot.

333
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,650
When we feel paranoid, this
is no, no, get away with that.

334
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:24,090
Everyone's going to have that experience.
But what is that really? Well,

335
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,330
tell you what it is, man.
It's like you're being,

336
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:33,380
you're being aware of [inaudible] the
shit in the world all at once and all of

337
00:19:33,891 --> 00:19:37,690
the ship that you were hiding in the
back of your head and all the shit that's

338
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,450
though your worst nightmare,

339
00:19:39,451 --> 00:19:41,370
that you're terrified that
you're actually manifesting.

340
00:19:41,371 --> 00:19:44,310
Cause you'd think about it all
the time and when you smoked pot,

341
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,810
all that shit comes to life and on top of
that you're just disoriented. You, you,

342
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:51,900
it's, it's like surfing. It's
like surfing can be great.

343
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:55,320
Surfing can be like I watched those guys
when they look like they're having a

344
00:19:55,321 --> 00:19:58,050
great fucking time and I go, God
Damn Surfing. It's like fine,

345
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,940
but you don't want stuff from,
doesn't look like fun.

346
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,650
When that wave comes over your fucking
head and smashes into the rocks and

347
00:20:04,651 --> 00:20:08,460
pulverizes your bones with
a million pounds of pressure
and you can't get to the

348
00:20:08,461 --> 00:20:11,160
surface. Well that's surfing too. Yeah,

349
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,520
we'll definitely roll your ass. Oh, you
don't know what you're fucking doing.

350
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:19,200
Especially if you fight it
and try to fight it at worst.

351
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:24,710
There's people that are fighting reality
every day and they often have like a

352
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:26,971
sort of a,

353
00:20:26,971 --> 00:20:31,740
a fake map of the world that they've
devised in their head and that's how they

354
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:34,410
navigate. They navigate through
this fake map of the world,

355
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,030
but a lot of the little segments in
their mind that they have associated with

356
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:43,770
certain things and details and a lot of
it is delusional because you're trying

357
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:47,980
to protect yourself from your
own failures. You're all,
you know what I mean? Like,

358
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,800
especially with men, I think,
you know, we have, you know,

359
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:55,120
guys have these fucked up egos that are
designed to make sure that you have a

360
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:59,740
will to survive when a cheetah attack
sir or fight off a another tribe so that

361
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:04,720
you, your DNA stays in tack weld.
That is a fucking creepy thing,

362
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,430
just running around through your vans.
So

363
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:11,320
yeah. What were we talking about here
is what they call it, set and setting,

364
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:15,010
which is like when you're going to take
a psychedelic, what's your mind state?

365
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,060
What, what's, how, what's your emotional
state when you take the psychedelic in?

366
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:23,640
If you go back to the idea that,
what's his name? John. Mark Alegra.

367
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,010
What's his name? John.
Marco. Ron. Yeah, John. Mark.

368
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:29,920
All Allegro talking about early
Christianity was a mushroom called.

369
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,030
Can you go back and you look at the idea
of when you're going to take communion

370
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:37,420
or when you go to pray or when
you go to the sacred place,

371
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,010
you're supposed to um,

372
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,000
forgive your brothers
and your sisters because,

373
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,980
but so the idea is before you go into
a psychedelic state, you need to,

374
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,130
as much as you can,
work out this shit that you're avoiding.

375
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,380
Because when you go into
that psychedelic state,

376
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,510
anything that you're
trying to skip around,

377
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:59,080
any of those aspects of your personality
that need to be a level there,

378
00:21:59,081 --> 00:22:00,640
needs to be balanced,

379
00:22:00,641 --> 00:22:05,020
are going to spring out at you in a
million different ways that are really

380
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:09,010
intense. And if you're not prepared for
that, then you'll have the bad trip.

381
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:13,000
And the bad trip is you will loose Nate.
You can see little see crazy shit.

382
00:22:13,001 --> 00:22:16,810
You'll look in the walls and see skulls.
Why are you seeing skulls? You know,

383
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,470
are you seeing bubbling skulls in the
wall where you're seeing bubbling skulls?

384
00:22:20,471 --> 00:22:23,170
Cause that's what you're projecting from
inside of you because you're fucking

385
00:22:23,171 --> 00:22:26,860
scared to death. You're scared to
die. You're terrified of letting go.

386
00:22:26,861 --> 00:22:30,460
You don't want to, you don't want to, uh,
you took, your body doesn't want to die.

387
00:22:30,461 --> 00:22:33,370
And then until you deal
with that initial thing,

388
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,700
then all these other neuroses will
spring up after that. You know,

389
00:22:36,701 --> 00:22:38,590
your avoidance of reality,

390
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:41,230
all the different weird ways that
you're trying to avoid reality,

391
00:22:41,231 --> 00:22:44,430
which is essentially just trying
to avoid coming to the grant,

392
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:47,200
to the terrain that you're on and
the terrain that we're all on,

393
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,520
his fucking intense. We're on a terrain
where we are going to go extinct.

394
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,820
And you know, who knows, depending
on how old you are, you know,

395
00:22:54,821 --> 00:22:59,821
but and depending on how much technology
advances between like 70 and 10 years,

396
00:23:01,331 --> 00:23:04,670
two years, one year, that's
an intense realm to exist on.

397
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,220
Um, I don't know. There's
a situation right now and
focusing on my, you know, the,

398
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,450
the whole thing with the,
uh,

399
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:15,510
the fourth reactor or they're terrified
that if any seismic event occur,

400
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:20,000
it's a zero chance of surviving
ascites seismic event. Right.

401
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:25,030
And we'll do and have another
blown reactor and we were
talking about it on the

402
00:23:25,031 --> 00:23:29,950
podcast and someone made a clip of it and
put it on this website where it's like,

403
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,590
and people were like discussing this,
like this is a serious issue.

404
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,100
One thing was that I was saying was that
we're going to have spots in this world

405
00:23:36,101 --> 00:23:39,670
because of nuclear power were for hundreds
of thousands of years it's going to

406
00:23:39,671 --> 00:23:43,900
be dead wastelands dead and there's a
bunch of them and there's a bunch of more

407
00:23:43,901 --> 00:23:46,850
plants out there that could
make a bunch more spot dead.

408
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:50,930
And this is just been less than a hundred
years we've been doing this and we've

409
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:53,810
already got three giant spots
where you can't go to anymore.

410
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:58,190
Have you seen like the places
where they store the nuclear rods,

411
00:23:58,191 --> 00:24:02,450
they like have special places like caves
and they put it in and I believe that

412
00:24:02,451 --> 00:24:07,310
they've, on the signs around the place,
they actually have like skulls and shit.

413
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:12,380
Everything's still on
case society collapses and
everyone forgets and thousands

414
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,670
of years past you go wandering up to
that place and there's this fucking skull

415
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:20,360
and you're you like, you just
recognize, okay, this is a cursed place.

416
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,490
One of the dumbest,
most brilliant ideas ever.

417
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,550
It's so dumb and so brilliant.
At the same time,

418
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:33,670
humans have a lot of Hubris and
it is a ridiculous one though.

419
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:37,920
We're fucking with something that
there is no technology to clean it.

420
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,860
There's no technology to turn it
into anything other than toxic,

421
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:47,240
lethal, horrible killing
shit. Yeah, it sucks man.

422
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,300
It's like the,

423
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,080
the exuberance of when that stuff
initially came out and people thought that

424
00:24:55,671 --> 00:25:00,671
they discovered endless fuels sources
that exuberance like was everywhere.

425
00:25:01,461 --> 00:25:04,690
It seemed like a real, it really
seemed like the most beautiful. Uh,

426
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,670
it seemed like we were entering
into utopia for awhile.

427
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,380
Did anybody ask them?
Like what happens when the power goes off?

428
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,970
Somebody who was like, dude,
you're being negative. Right?

429
00:25:18,971 --> 00:25:22,540
It had to be like some sort of a stupid
argument where no one considered the

430
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:26,360
possibility that the power could go off.
You could lose both backup generators.

431
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,060
You have no other way of fixing those.
He just built a son,

432
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:34,610
felt a little tiny son and we were
just going to leave it there. That's,

433
00:25:34,611 --> 00:25:39,220
that's insane. Well, yeah, I mean you
can't call it off. You can't call it off.

434
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,560
You can't. It's a demon basically.
If summoned the demon, the demon,

435
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,320
it is.
It really truly is.

436
00:25:45,321 --> 00:25:47,510
Like you have some in the demon
when we have nuclear power,

437
00:25:47,511 --> 00:25:50,160
if you really stop and think about that,
if there was some,

438
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:54,890
if a demon existed and in his very
presence he was poisoning the environment,

439
00:25:54,891 --> 00:25:57,890
no plants could grow. I, and
that is a demon by definition.

440
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,640
And then when it gets near him,
dies a horrible twisted death.

441
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,080
That's a demon.

442
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:07,460
This is something people don't understand
with like a cult talk where people

443
00:26:07,461 --> 00:26:10,880
talk about demons,
like so many demons and so many spirits,

444
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:14,450
they dig that shit literally. So they
hear someone saying, I, you know,

445
00:26:14,451 --> 00:26:16,730
I'll invoke these things
to summon a demon.

446
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:19,820
And so then a lot of great
movies and been made after that,

447
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,330
the literal interpretation of
that. But every fucking day, man,

448
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:27,680
not just on a grand scale without so
many nuclear power, but in little ways,

449
00:26:27,681 --> 00:26:31,190
people fucking summon demons into their
life all the time with no thought of how

450
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:34,730
to get rid of it every time. You
know, like when people shoot heroin,

451
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,950
that's something a fucking demon.

452
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:42,270
Like you've been told by every single
other like necromancer is someone that

453
00:26:42,471 --> 00:26:43,980
demon,
that shit will fuck

454
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,700
you up. But people who do heroin and they
don't, they always start off with like,

455
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,850
you know what? I'm just going to do it
once. Just want to see what it feels like.

456
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,350
Everyone does that.

457
00:26:52,351 --> 00:26:57,240
And then you fucking end up
under a fucking bridge with
three Cox in your mouth.

458
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:00,670
Oh, from, Oh,

459
00:27:00,671 --> 00:27:04,830
from summoning this one stupid fucking
demon that is just destroyed so many

460
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,780
people and heroin demons,

461
00:27:06,781 --> 00:27:10,650
a great word for heroin because it offers
you something because so many people

462
00:27:10,651 --> 00:27:15,330
they say, oh yeah, fucking a Jimi
Hendrix. Love this stuff. Or, or,

463
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,600
uh, Elliot Smith, listen
how beautiful his music is.

464
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:23,010
You can go on and on about the people
who shot heroin and like made beautiful

465
00:27:23,011 --> 00:27:25,160
stuff. So there is an exchange. I mean,

466
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,460
doesn't that kind of tickle around in
your head when he Bruce was blast and this

467
00:27:28,461 --> 00:27:32,330
shit, you know, it doesn't,
it kind of tickled around.
You're like, what the f what?

468
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,220
Maybe what is that?
Maybe there is a little land,

469
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:39,780
like you rise up and see this landscape
that you can't see from the psychedelic

470
00:27:39,781 --> 00:27:40,570
perspective

471
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:45,350
and maybe it's a, it doesn't seem to be
worth it. Whatever it is, I'll, I'll,

472
00:27:45,351 --> 00:27:48,750
I'll look at it as like, what
makes you happy? And uh, I don't,

473
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,480
I don't see people taking heroin
and getting super happy from it.

474
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,310
Everyone that I've ever
known that did heroin,

475
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:57,750
the come down from it was
unbelievably bad. By bone jarring.

476
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,260
It would say your bones were,
that's how they would describe it.

477
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,330
Terrible drug.
You know,

478
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,850
you never see any like marathon
runners who were like shooting.

479
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:08,200
I had a friend who, uh, he was, uh, uh,

480
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:12,040
it was a good buddy of mine that lived
in New York and he came to visit me and I

481
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:15,460
didn't know when he was coming to visit
me that he was trying to kick heroin.

482
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:18,520
And then he was going to do is just
come and hang out with me at my house in

483
00:28:18,521 --> 00:28:22,960
California and kick heroin with me.
So that's, I did not, no, I didn't.

484
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:27,270
I didn't know how bad he had it. I hadn't
seen him in a couple of years. So he,

485
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:32,290
he flew out and the dude was
just in bed sick for like six,

486
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:35,170
seven days. He couldn't go anywhere, man.

487
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:38,620
I would get him food and shit
and he couldn't go anywhere.

488
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,250
He came with me to work one
day I was on news radio.

489
00:28:42,251 --> 00:28:45,940
He came and just sat around the set,
but he couldn't,

490
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:51,550
he couldn't move around. Man,
that dude was a, he was jacked.

491
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,210
It's amazing to see that,
isn't it?

492
00:28:53,211 --> 00:28:57,950
It's amazing to see that traps that we
set for ourselves in the world that are

493
00:28:57,951 --> 00:28:59,060
completely avoidable,

494
00:28:59,061 --> 00:29:03,650
but for some reason we always set these
traps and then they smash on us and we

495
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,620
go through this awful period.
And then if you're lucky,

496
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:08,000
you get out on the other side.

497
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,800
That kind of goes back to
what you were talking about,

498
00:29:09,801 --> 00:29:14,480
this idea of like having that near
death experience or having this awful

499
00:29:14,481 --> 00:29:17,780
catastrophe happened in your life.
If you handle it the right way,

500
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:22,430
you can become a million times stronger
and back from that catastrophe.

501
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:23,810
People don't realize that.

502
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,590
So they're always putting off what could
essentially be the thing that makes

503
00:29:27,591 --> 00:29:29,660
them happier than they've
ever been in their life.

504
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,670
Well, it's kind of a weird way of
looking at it. I mean, you can,

505
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:38,020
you could possibly be happy because
of a gastro or it could be horrible.

506
00:29:38,021 --> 00:29:40,000
You could lose someone we love,
you know,

507
00:29:40,001 --> 00:29:43,690
I don't think all catastrophes
and unnecessarily too great,

508
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,580
not great revelations,

509
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:50,350
but I think occasionally it can
give you an enhanced perspective.

510
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:53,080
Something that happens to you.
I mean,

511
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:56,260
the most interesting people that we all
know are people that have gone through a

512
00:29:56,261 --> 00:30:00,220
lot of shit in their life. You know,
a lot of crazy experiences, you know,

513
00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:01,090
know those,

514
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:06,140
the having to overcome terrible things
in places is sort of what makes them

515
00:30:06,491 --> 00:30:07,324
exceptional.

516
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,100
That's right, man. But there's a,

517
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:14,370
there's a certain group of people who
liked to live pretending that catastrophes

518
00:30:16,121 --> 00:30:18,430
will never happen to them.
Right. This is a ridiculous,

519
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:19,620
yeah.

520
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:24,400
The people that are overweight smoking
every day and I have a friend who is,

521
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,390
I guess he like 16 and uh,
he,

522
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,530
he smokes two packs a day and he'll
tell you when he's always like making

523
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:34,450
excuses. Like they've
even said no, that a,

524
00:30:34,451 --> 00:30:37,330
it's all either you have
the gene or you do not.

525
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,670
So there's a lot of people that
will smoke cigarettes and never,

526
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:42,850
I'm in smoking cigarettes for
40 years. I am. I did the,

527
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:46,180
I wish I don't have the gene or I don't,
I have cancer. I went to the doctor,

528
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,370
my doctor says, you look
great, you look great.

529
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:51,280
The doctors looking at you and he's like,
you smoke how much a day?

530
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,980
And you're like two bags. And he's
like, you look great. You look great.

531
00:30:53,981 --> 00:30:55,180
Get the fuck out of here.

532
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,270
When is he going to do to somebody
who's fucking intentionally poisoning

533
00:30:58,271 --> 00:31:02,860
themselves all day,
intentionally poison yourself all day.

534
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:07,630
Not even just one pack. You
Glutton, glutton, nicotine vampire,

535
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,260
two packs a day, all day. Of course your
doctor's going to tell you what great.

536
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:14,200
You look great. Get the fuck Outta here.
I'm gonna see you soon though, bitch.

537
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,810
And then we'll be back soon and
we'll be back for some crazy shit.

538
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,560
I'm calling my uncle up, right? Yeah.

539
00:31:18,561 --> 00:31:23,260
My uncle is an oncologist and then we've
got our eye on you. That's amazing. Yeah,

540
00:31:23,261 --> 00:31:25,530
that's incredible. I never thought
I had a lot of money makers.

541
00:31:25,531 --> 00:31:29,680
Smokers are for doctors. Well
course. I mean if you're a doctor,

542
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:33,220
you want your people. Well,
if you are a real doctor,

543
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:36,460
I mean it's obviously people
that don't operate for money,

544
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,850
you know the operate because they
love being an excellent surgeon or an

545
00:31:39,851 --> 00:31:41,050
excellent doctor.
And you know,

546
00:31:41,051 --> 00:31:43,540
we're not disparaging the
medical profession at all,

547
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,970
but if you were like some
money grubbing crazy doctor,

548
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,060
but there are a few of those out there,
right? Yeah, I've heard of them. Yeah,

549
00:31:52,061 --> 00:31:55,570
there's every now and then there was some
money grubbing like Michael Jackson's

550
00:31:55,571 --> 00:31:59,010
doctor. Dude, that
fucking crazy. Yeah Man,

551
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:03,260
I've got fucking fillings in my mouth.
Oh, they don't need to be there.

552
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:07,810
Cause my dentist, as it turns out
with giving unnecessary failing,

553
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:12,100
so I've got like,
I got fucking monster

554
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,920
kid. I just thought, I was
like, I just thought I,

555
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,710
I naturally was always getting cavities.
Oh my God. You know what I mean?

556
00:32:18,711 --> 00:32:22,080
I was always getting,
I was getting blasted with fucking right.

557
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,200
Last Guy's ruining kids' teeth join
and the kids too and making money.

558
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,960
I hope he's in jail.
He's in jail.

559
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:30,300
No. What happened to him when,
when that scandal hit? Yeah.

560
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:33,040
That's not just fraud. I'm,
I'll beat the fuck out of you.

561
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:36,610
Drove holes in my kids had it didn't
need to be there because you're trying to

562
00:32:36,611 --> 00:32:38,290
make money like that.
Fucking judge.

563
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,300
I wouldn't want to beat the
fuck out of that dentist.

564
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,450
Great to match his
fucking head. White. Yeah.

565
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:47,640
Imagine anybody that would do that to a
little kid. Yeah. Just to make some money.

566
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,920
Sure. That's a big,
this is something that,

567
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,520
this is a facet of reality.
So scary.

568
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:56,860
Imagine like what mine
state do you have to be in,

569
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,250
especially your fucking dentist.
You already making great money.

570
00:33:00,251 --> 00:33:02,300
Like why do you need the extra dough?

571
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:06,110
Exactly. Oh what? I mean
how, oh Jesus Christ.

572
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:10,630
How can you justify that? That would move.
I would never sleep. I would have to,

573
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,620
however I have to find that guy in prison.

574
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,900
I might get a wasted just so I
can go to prison with him. Oh,

575
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,070
find out what prison needs.
Yeah,

576
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,280
I underground by now.

577
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,390
I mean if it was my kid, you know what
I'm saying? I mean I would literally,

578
00:33:22,391 --> 00:33:26,740
I would want to get arrested and put in
a sell near him to so I could beat the

579
00:33:26,741 --> 00:33:30,220
fuck out of him after he got arrested.
Yeah.

580
00:33:30,221 --> 00:33:33,130
Well there's a lot of it just
wouldn't be able to deal with it.

581
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,480
Some guy with drilling and we're baby's
head to try to make himself some extra

582
00:33:37,481 --> 00:33:38,314
scratch.
Yeah.

583
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:41,740
Cause we're asked to be a big shot at a
restaurant and buy a nice bottle of wine.

584
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,380
Is that what's going on?
Sure. Fucking asshole.

585
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:49,410
Yeah. I mean, who knows? But think of it,
I think to me is like that there was a,

586
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,540
a lot of people out
there who live like that.

587
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,920
Sure. There's a lot of people have
done, doesn't associate press. I mean,

588
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:58,130
you've seen the studies. There's,
there's been, you know, the,

589
00:33:58,131 --> 00:34:02,450
I believe it was time magazine or someone
recently had some article about a new

590
00:34:02,451 --> 00:34:05,420
book that's out there.
It was something like one in a hundred,

591
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,790
none of the hundred people
just fucking sociopath.

592
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,200
So remember the guy who recently went
rampaging through that kid's camp? Was it?

593
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:17,170
Where was it? Norway? Was
it your way? Yeah. Oh wait,

594
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,230
you went rampaging through that
camp? Just killing fucking, yeah.

595
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:21,950
And over there they don't,

596
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,440
they're not like the United
States don't have a death penalty.

597
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,710
So like they're giving this guy,

598
00:34:26,711 --> 00:34:30,140
it's for a fair trial and they made a
big show of the fact that we're going to

599
00:34:30,141 --> 00:34:34,670
do this. There's not going to be some
kind of a crazy visceral response to this.

600
00:34:34,671 --> 00:34:37,460
And so in the trial, the guy, uh,

601
00:34:37,461 --> 00:34:42,080
apparently is going into a
detailed account of how we
went walking through this

602
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:46,490
camp and shock kids who are hiding from
him and shot kids and how they tried to

603
00:34:46,491 --> 00:34:50,450
run and how he found some of them by
thinking where he would hide if he was one

604
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:52,370
of these kids and he's enjoying it.

605
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,560
He's getting off on it
because he's a sociopath.

606
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:59,150
It feels good for him to tell the story.
So in these situations,

607
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:04,390
sometimes I think has passivism
gone too far in this situation?

608
00:35:05,511 --> 00:35:09,080
The guy clearly shot a bunch of kids.
The guy,

609
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:14,140
why do we need to discover if his true
motivation or what his real crime was?

610
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,800
We know what the crime was.

611
00:35:15,801 --> 00:35:19,880
There's a bunch of dead kids because
of this guy went rampaging through

612
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:25,040
sometimes. Don't you think you can
go too far on the side of 100%? Yeah.

613
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,650
Well, we'll live with the Dalai Lama
man. Dot. Randall seems like a great guy,

614
00:35:28,651 --> 00:35:30,570
but he's never gotten
a blow job in his life.

615
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:35,070
We know it's a stupid wedding and he says
he doesn't know sex. Oh, he does. Yeah.

616
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,070
So is it doesn't have relations
and it says like, he sees it,

617
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,170
he's attracted to her, but he was
too much work. It's just, you know,

618
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,430
he laughs about it. That's,
but that's silly. That's silly.

619
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:49,350
You're missing out on a big chunk of
life. I think he's got some posey. Well,

620
00:35:49,351 --> 00:35:52,530
I would hope so. I wouldn't hate him for
it. I think it would be a good thing.

621
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,113
But he's a month.

622
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,130
There's nothing. Yeah. But I mean,

623
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:00,220
isn't that like part of the whole thing
was the seller was saying the idea that,

624
00:36:00,221 --> 00:36:01,900
you know,
you're beyond the needs of the flash.

625
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,680
Yeah. There's like the, I
mean, I don't, I honestly,

626
00:36:04,681 --> 00:36:08,130
I've heard with Tibetan Buddhism that
there's some tantric sex that happens in

627
00:36:08,131 --> 00:36:09,680
there and uh, and, and yeah,

628
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,970
we should probably
Google this, right? Yeah.

629
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:17,310
Is the Dalai Lama and the
Dalai Lama salivate. So all of,

630
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:23,120
I love to know that. Yeah. It
seems like an interesting question.

631
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,860
This keyword socks at fat duck.

632
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:31,470
I, I mean, I guess that I can
understand why monks say to be celibate,

633
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,670
if, if there's no more, if
it's not an ethical decision.

634
00:36:33,671 --> 00:36:38,410
I understand like the complication
that can come from fucking people is

635
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,340
ridiculous.
Spectacular.

636
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,260
It's come flash durations like
lifelong can flag durations.

637
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,390
You can bring up being in the life.

638
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,800
Yeah, you can. It's a really
pain. It's a pain in the ass.

639
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,080
Yeah.
It's a pain in the fucking ass man.

640
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,970
He's not only supposed to be a
virgin. Yeah, he's a version. Yeah.

641
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:02,070
Well there you go ladies with
Dalai Lama's origin dude. Have you

642
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,830
heard about that glue in India
that you blast into your boss?

643
00:37:05,831 --> 00:37:08,060
The clog up your seminar?

644
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:12,560
Yeah. You sent it to me. Yeah. And so at
that, is that what it is? It's load glue,

645
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:17,320
load glue. It's the new male
birth control that apparently uh,

646
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:20,700
not as permanent is getting,
have a sec.

647
00:37:20,701 --> 00:37:23,790
To me it lasts between five and 10 years,

648
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:28,260
but they essentially just put airplane
glue or some kind of gel and deer.

649
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,300
They just pull you up so you can't,

650
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:33,720
you're just doesn't have the
fucking worms in anymore.

651
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,680
That's you're,
you're repurposing your loads.

652
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,350
How could that possibly mean

653
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:45,180
by your load smell like
fucking Zombie baby as well?

654
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:46,830
It's probably smell like rubber met.

655
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:50,220
Could you imagine if that was like the
beginning of the next fucking 28 days

656
00:37:50,221 --> 00:37:54,140
later type movie? It turns out that
the shoot some shit and two loads and,

657
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:58,520
but it wouldn't makes a Zombie babies.
Yeah, but either way. Are you a person?

658
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,330
Good. That's a great harm.
Bites the doctor. Nothing.

659
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,500
The doctor becomes a Zombie Zombie.

660
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:07,890
Dr fucking furiously
attacks all the nurses.

661
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:11,490
They stab each other becoming to a
fucking puddles. Slippery a blog,

662
00:38:11,491 --> 00:38:15,090
a bunch of Zombie fucking doctors
biting each other and shit.

663
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,550
All from one fucking Zombie baby.

664
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,570
Oh from one Zombie baby from one Zombie
low that was created by this crazy drug

665
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,040
in an Indian doctor.

666
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:28,020
Just a tornado of infection
spreads through the nation
from this one hot point.

667
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:32,300
Well we don't call in Dustin
Hoffman and her fucking space suit,

668
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:36,040
but you know,
he knows that he just had that

669
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,000
procedure done to his boss and he like
shot a load and to his girlfriend and

670
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:40,834
she's pregnant.

671
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,990
So like this is fence through the
movie is wondering if his girlfriend,

672
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:47,800
he's got a Zombie baby and her,
this is a great movie.

673
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,350
Great movie directors out there.
Let's just make sure

674
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,890
whoever made Trollhunter please contact

675
00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:00,310
Trollhunters. Great. It's really
fun man. I know. I love that movie,

676
00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:03,850
but it's a fun movie. It was the one,
the foreign one, right? One in subtitles.

677
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:06,890
Oh wait, no. I thought you were talking
about the worst movie ever made.

678
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:11,220
No, this is actually not that bad. It's
about a guy who goes and hunts trolls.

679
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:14,240
Does like rich, real live
trolls. The woods. It's a, yeah.

680
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:19,090
Oh, Trollhunters. Yeah. Trollhunter
yeah, it's really good. It's really fun.

681
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,840
And it's shot like found footage.
Yes, exactly. Yeah. Troll hunters.

682
00:39:22,841 --> 00:39:27,060
That Beth was really good. It's a fun
movie or movies like that. Yeah, that one.

683
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:27,550
Yeah.

684
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:31,870
I love stupid movies, man.
Like I'm so looking forward
to the Avengers. So much so,

685
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:35,120
but I feel like I'm getting away with
something by being able to watch it. Yeah.

686
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:38,950
Like I'm 44 years old at a certain point
in time. I'm supposed to be past that.

687
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,970
I was supposed to be, you know,
interested in mature things, but I'm not,

688
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,860
I want to watch the Hawk fuck somebody up.

689
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,733
Let me tell you though,

690
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:51,390
that fucking idea of maturity
or how you're supposed to
act at some certain age.

691
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:56,180
What the fuck is that idea? Because the
way you're supposed to act is so boring.

692
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:59,240
Like it's basically saying just act like,
act like you're going to,

693
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,430
you're just a dying old piece of shit.

694
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:06,110
You don't like fucking super
insane special effects anymore.

695
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,890
You certainly don't like video games.
Kids with their music these days.

696
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:14,540
You go to bed at 10 you know like fuck
that. What it goes idea was that anyway,

697
00:40:14,541 --> 00:40:18,890
that was just like a control freak.
Boring guys. Like this is how an adult rx,

698
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:19,291
yeah.

699
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:22,340
Well it gets to a certain point in time
when you compromise your thinking every

700
00:40:22,341 --> 00:40:24,850
day. So much so for
work, you know, if you,

701
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,230
if you have to go in and everyday you
got to sell vacuum cleaners and you're a

702
00:40:28,231 --> 00:40:28,621
dude,

703
00:40:28,621 --> 00:40:31,740
I guarantee you there's some days when
you don't want to go in and sell fucking

704
00:40:31,741 --> 00:40:34,530
vacuum cleaners.
You don't want to not swear all day.

705
00:40:34,531 --> 00:40:37,440
You don't want to wear a tie, but
you got it. That's part of the job.

706
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:42,070
And so one of the ways to sort of
keep that going. Well you don't,

707
00:40:42,071 --> 00:40:43,220
you're extreme isn't it?

708
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:46,230
Like the make the whole rest of
your life less extreme as well.

709
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:51,090
No more fun shit that need, you need a
sensible car. You can't drive a Mustang.

710
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:55,440
You know? You need to stop getting
drunk on the weekends. You've got a job.

711
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:59,430
Got to become SFW. Yeah. Safe
for work. Say for work. Yeah.

712
00:40:59,431 --> 00:41:01,770
And that's why they were
allowed to drug test you. Yeah.

713
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:04,980
That's one of the most incredible things
that we've let happen this country.

714
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:08,580
Employers are allowed to drug test

715
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:14,420
their employees. That's insane.
The idea that someone you play,

716
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:18,240
you pay for a person's work,
you don't own their flesh.

717
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:20,010
You don't own them as a human being.

718
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,650
And especially when we're talking
about stuff like medical marijuana,

719
00:41:22,651 --> 00:41:24,960
which is actually supposed
to be legal in California.

720
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:28,530
There's a lot of places where you
still can't get a medical marijuana

721
00:41:28,531 --> 00:41:29,041
prescription.

722
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:32,650
You can't get an exemption and worked
for a lot of different companies. Yeah,

723
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,650
they won't. They won't have it. They won't
hire you. They don't want any products.

724
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:40,010
Yeah. It's a, it's a, it's a real
problem because with corporations,

725
00:41:40,011 --> 00:41:42,050
I just learned this word and
I really fucking love it.

726
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,380
It's called diffusion of responsibility,

727
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:49,340
which is the idea that incorporations
their responsibility gets so many people

728
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:53,600
make decisions on things that
no one person's to blame.
Right, right. So, you know,

729
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:56,270
when the corporation,
somewhere in the corporation,

730
00:41:56,271 --> 00:41:58,730
not everyone's anti marijuana,

731
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,580
just a couple of cots and
you don't know who they are,

732
00:42:01,581 --> 00:42:03,740
but they got that in there.
They're all, you know,

733
00:42:03,741 --> 00:42:06,680
at some meeting they just got it in and
where other people didn't agree with

734
00:42:06,681 --> 00:42:10,550
them and they didn't speak up. That's
what's annoying about it. You know,

735
00:42:10,551 --> 00:42:13,070
that this is coming from
just a few dipshits.

736
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:15,800
The majority of people
have no problem with it.

737
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,400
Fucking Nancy Polosi did you
see she came out against Obama?

738
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:22,100
Did you see that shit? What
she do? She fucking with,

739
00:42:22,101 --> 00:42:25,910
she pointed out the fact that Obama is
busted more dispensaries than Bush did.

740
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:30,350
Wow. Cause she's pro medical marijuana
and she talked about all the help.

741
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,820
Oh and how many people are actually helps
in like what the fuck is Obama doing?

742
00:42:34,821 --> 00:42:39,110
Why is the arresting all these people?
Yeah. When we voted on it, you know

743
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:44,050
diffusional responsibility as another
place that's used. Yes. That's an rape.

744
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,860
Oh yeah.
Right.

745
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,400
One person is much more likely to be able
to rape another person when there's a

746
00:42:51,441 --> 00:42:53,070
big group of people around.
Yeah.

747
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,580
Because nobody knows who should act
first and everybody feels like it's not

748
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,840
their responsibility because
there's so many people,

749
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,920
you always got to act first.
That's the role. Oh, exact first.

750
00:43:02,921 --> 00:43:05,740
If you see someone in the fucking street
who doesn't look like they're doing

751
00:43:05,741 --> 00:43:08,740
okay,
stop and ask them if they're okay.

752
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:12,230
If you see somebody's car's fucked up on
the side of the road, not a flat, right.

753
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,340
If it's the first song be

754
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,350
well, if you go, are you okay?

755
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:20,880
And that fucking bitch leans over and
bite your arm in half and blood screaming.

756
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,680
You're screaming as you're
driving to a hospital,

757
00:43:22,681 --> 00:43:24,420
you turn into a Zombie
and crashed into a tree.

758
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:24,921
Look man,

759
00:43:24,921 --> 00:43:28,220
there's like a 90% chance if you see
someone on the street and try to help them

760
00:43:28,221 --> 00:43:29,530
that their prior to the first Zombie.

761
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:30,503
It could happen.

762
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:35,840
It could be the other 10% hey man,
look,

763
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:38,220
I'm not taking any chances when
the Zombie apocalypse hits.

764
00:43:38,221 --> 00:43:40,560
You don't want to be fucking patient.
Zero. That's what I'm saying.

765
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:45,080
You see a rape happening and you try to
stop it and it was just a dude trying to

766
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:46,040
rape a Zombie.

767
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,930
Well Zombie trying to up a dude.

768
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:53,650
That'd be a lot scarier because if like
gravy zombies were doing was raping us,

769
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,430
army go.
He's an idiot.

770
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:59,300
Why would you want to rape on Max the
next evolution of bombing cause we made

771
00:43:59,301 --> 00:44:02,080
him right now will be raped. It's B. Yeah.

772
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:05,660
That's like ultimate fighting champion.
That's not bad ass enough.

773
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,660
You didn't need to be a Zombie raper yeah.
Have you ever raped a Zombie?

774
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,210
And the thing about raping a
Zombie as they'll fight hard,

775
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:14,960
but no one cares if you beat the shit
out of them and be like led zombies,

776
00:44:14,961 --> 00:44:17,330
loosen the field and you could
just go beat the shit out.

777
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:20,850
No Dude, this is a sketch. I
actually wrote a sketch like this.

778
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:23,010
Promise zombies can
infect you, right? Yes.

779
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,540
How's that work? That doesn't make
any sense. Only 28 days later,

780
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:29,000
zombies can affect you. Well
know the biological. Yeah,

781
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:29,993
there's different,

782
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:34,890
there's different ex ex explanations and
the walking dead's got a really fucking

783
00:44:34,891 --> 00:44:37,740
good one that I, it's the liquid
spoil a lot of shit to say it,

784
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:39,780
but there's a lot of different
explanations for it. That's really,

785
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,070
that's pretty cool.

786
00:44:41,071 --> 00:44:45,330
The way that the creators of these stories
come up with like what it is, right?

787
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,380
It's, I mean there's no rule for
it. It could be anything. Yeah,

788
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,260
but it does in the walking dead. It's a
biological thing where in fact people,

789
00:44:52,261 --> 00:44:55,080
but there's movies where
they come out of the ground,

790
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:58,500
so obviously that's not what's happened
though. Those are different ones.

791
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,720
That's like, I mean, which ones
did they come out of the ground?

792
00:45:00,721 --> 00:45:03,180
That's return of the living
dead. Yeah, that kind of Shit.

793
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:08,360
I favor God. Yeah. Movies. Fucking it's,

794
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:11,520
you know why it was great cause
the zombies can fucking talk.

795
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:15,120
So remember they had that lady
strapped to the table. Spoiler alert.

796
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,830
They had that lady strapped to the table.
It was like a halfway.

797
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,650
Do you remember that?
And they're like,

798
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,860
they asked her because no one's
asked the Zombie. They asked her,

799
00:45:22,861 --> 00:45:27,690
why do you eat brains?
Remember that? It's like, wow,

800
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:32,460
stop, stop paying off
debt. Oh my God dude.

801
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,460
Cause we never get to
really interview a Zombie.

802
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:39,880
I remember that now. Yeah, that's
right. They would call out brain.

803
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:44,940
Great. That's such a good, Ooh,
that was a great, I mean I was,

804
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,560
I was confusing that with
night of the living dead look,

805
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:49,470
maternal living dead is actually better

806
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:53,900
return of the living dead. I pop out of
Grapes of the living dead. As I recall.

807
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:56,930
We sit the opening of
night of the living dead.

808
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:00,980
Remember it's in the graveyard and he's
trying to scare his girlfriend and she's

809
00:46:00,981 --> 00:46:03,110
like,
who's that man walking back there?

810
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:07,460
And there's some dude kind of walking far
away. This zombies couldn't walk fast,

811
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:11,870
right? And so we just Kinda ambles up
to the guy and like it throws him down.

812
00:46:11,871 --> 00:46:15,260
The guy hits his head on a grave stone
and then she's like driving away in

813
00:46:15,261 --> 00:46:19,580
terror. But we never know if that
Zombie emerged from a coffin.

814
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:24,620
I think that was somebody who is like,
I don't think, I don't think it, yeah.

815
00:46:24,621 --> 00:46:24,981
First of all,

816
00:46:24,981 --> 00:46:27,380
you're not going to get out of a fucking
coffin if you're a Zombie zombies.

817
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:29,630
They're already week 10 week.

818
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:34,880
Well the 90 little are all very nice.
We were living dead zombies week,

819
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:38,390
slow lumbering,
purely retarded.

820
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,090
So if you were like a
really good kick boxer,

821
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:44,480
you could probably like
keep a lot of mafia easily.

822
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,840
This is a lot leg kick.

823
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,550
It's simple moat as simple mode would fix.

824
00:46:49,551 --> 00:46:52,490
Most of them say by you and you're fucked,
right? You're fucked. You're a Tommy.

825
00:46:52,491 --> 00:46:52,760
Now,

826
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,940
if you get bitten by a Zombie years on
that night of the living dead as well,

827
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,060
that's not living dead
return of the living dead.

828
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:03,010
I think all of them share the idea
that if you get bitten by one,

829
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:03,800
you turn it into one.

830
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:08,450
Huh? I thought, hmm, but you had
to die. And some of them, oh,

831
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:09,700
when you come back as well,

832
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:13,730
I think in all of them or all of
them and living on 28 days later,

833
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,850
remember you just get one byte in your
frock. Remember when that chick hatched?

834
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:19,550
Did her boyfriend,
she machete one and he's like,

835
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:22,520
it was just a scratch and she
just fuck you and just boom,

836
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:27,740
boom with a fucking machete. She machete
dem in the kitchen. That was radical.

837
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:31,480
Remember that was such a good
fucking great fucking movie.

838
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:34,310
That's the greatest Saudi movie
of all time. 28 days later.

839
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,970
My opinion is the greatest cause.
It's the most original,

840
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:40,450
the whole scene where the guy wakes up
and he doesn't know what the fuck is

841
00:47:40,451 --> 00:47:43,900
going on. That's really the same
scene that the walking dead is used.

842
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:45,480
They've used the same sort of thing.

843
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:49,300
This guy wakes up in the hospital and
he doesn't realize that the world was

844
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:53,650
turned to a fucking Zombie shit hole.
That's how do you get to do that?

845
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:57,460
Um, that's sort of the same
scene as 20 days later.

846
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:59,610
You know,
what I to we'd have to look into is,

847
00:47:59,611 --> 00:48:03,480
which came first 28 days later
or the walking dead comics,

848
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,220
comics. So whichever came, well,

849
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,430
let's find out walking dead comics,

850
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,920
walking dead comics by them. If you
haven't, there's still fucking good.

851
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:16,410
How many years do you think they'd
been around for? I don't know,

852
00:48:16,411 --> 00:48:19,070
but I like for a long time.
There's a lot of them and it's,

853
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:20,550
it's at the show is good.

854
00:48:20,551 --> 00:48:23,640
I love the show and the show gets
a little too soap opera like,

855
00:48:23,641 --> 00:48:28,320
but the fucking comics, they're just
brutal. And just if you, if you haven't,

856
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:31,380
download them to your iPad and by
him cause they're fucking awesome.

857
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:34,980
Mm.
It's Wikipedia.

858
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:41,720
Yeah. We're living in a fucking
beautiful time, man. Some guy, uh,

859
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:44,750
said something really recently. Uh, um,

860
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:46,530
I'll go look at it after
I figured this out.

861
00:48:46,531 --> 00:48:51,531
2003 is what is a first issue
of the walking dead comics.

862
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:58,010
So now let's look up return
the living dead. No, no.

863
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:02,850
28 days later. Oh yeah, yeah. Sorry,
Tony. I think that was earlier.

864
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:09,510
I'm pretty sure, but I'm
just guessing. Let's see.

865
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:14,940
2002. Hmm. Ooh, it's
earlier sign of a bitch.

866
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:15,803
Yeah.

867
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:21,570
Well that's so close that it
might've been parallel thinking.

868
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,770
Yeah, I know. Who knows these guys.
First of all, it's kind of like,

869
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:28,230
if you want to make a Zombie
movie about a big apocalypse,

870
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:31,770
wouldn't a cool way to do it to be wake
up and, yeah. I mean, everybody's afraid.

871
00:49:31,771 --> 00:49:33,930
You wake up and you're going to get up
in the morning and nuclear bombs had

872
00:49:33,931 --> 00:49:34,710
already dropped.

873
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:36,030
You know what else it serves,

874
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:40,350
what purpose it serves is you don't
have to explain how it happened as you

875
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:42,090
started the big [inaudible] guy waking up.

876
00:49:42,091 --> 00:49:45,420
So you don't really have to go into
the hall what ship proceeding it,

877
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:50,030
which by the way, I fucking
love dawn of the dead. Oh yeah.

878
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:53,580
Remember dawn of the dead and the
fucking news studio remember that?

879
00:49:53,581 --> 00:49:55,050
And it's all falling apart.

880
00:49:55,051 --> 00:49:58,050
It's just starting to fall the fuck
apart and people are trying to like

881
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:02,040
rationalize what's happening and swat
teams are going in and just blowing the

882
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:05,730
shit out of people and the all of
society is collapsing. I love that.

883
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:10,690
I like starting at the collapse of
society and then going into that post

884
00:50:10,691 --> 00:50:11,910
apocalyptic state.

885
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,750
I hate movies that are the
lead up to the disaster.

886
00:50:15,751 --> 00:50:20,751
We're like 80% of the movie is like the
lead up and then you just get 20% of

887
00:50:21,391 --> 00:50:24,420
apocalypse.
I like fucking 90% apocalypse.

888
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:27,110
Well, what's a really cool movie?
Like, it's weird. It's very,

889
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:32,300
it's called Ponti Pool. It's a, I think
it's a Canadian movie and it's about, um,

890
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:37,430
these people that are, um,
they're, they're in a radio studio.

891
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,080
The whole show takes place.

892
00:50:39,081 --> 00:50:43,940
The whole movie takes place in like
essentially one scene. It's one area.

893
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:45,500
It's all in this radio studio.

894
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:49,280
They're trapped in there while this
Zombie apocalypse is raging to their town.

895
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,710
Yeah. It's pretty fucking
cool. Fucking cool, man.

896
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:55,910
They're the people that were working
with them become infected and they're

897
00:50:55,911 --> 00:50:57,020
trapped in the sound booth.

898
00:50:57,021 --> 00:51:00,530
They realize that these things are blind
or they can hear you and they could

899
00:51:00,531 --> 00:51:03,440
smell you. And they like trying
to get at them to the glass.

900
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,670
It's pretty fucking cool man. It's
like a real low budget sort of a movie.

901
00:51:07,671 --> 00:51:11,870
But it was, I found to be pretty original
dude, if you know what I'm saying.

902
00:51:11,871 --> 00:51:14,090
It's like one of those,
you want to watch something creepy.

903
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:15,350
That's why something creepy nights.

904
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:19,470
Yeah, that's it. If you've seen,
um, uh, the road or read the road,

905
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:23,610
do you that's the, uh, Hugo Vigo Morgan.

906
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:26,890
I watched that up until the point when
he was teaching his son how to shoot

907
00:51:26,891 --> 00:51:29,500
himself in the mouth. And
I was like, check please.

908
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:32,980
I think the author of that
book was Cormac Mccarthy.

909
00:51:32,981 --> 00:51:37,570
I think I remember the name of the book
was insane. But that fucking movie man,

910
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:41,020
to me that really captured what
it's gonna look like, if at all.

911
00:51:41,021 --> 00:51:43,540
I'm sure that's what
it fucking looks like.

912
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:48,130
Just want people just
desperately trying to find food.

913
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:51,880
Cause even the walking dead like there's
trying to find food but somehow like

914
00:51:51,881 --> 00:51:54,190
they always end up,
I guess they were on a farm in part of it.

915
00:51:54,191 --> 00:51:57,700
They end up with some pretty nice
home cooked meals and people see,

916
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,150
you know people are like,
yeah,

917
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:02,670
people have like set ups
where they have big fences and

918
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,360
yeah,
and they look crossbar.

919
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:09,240
They've been taking vitamins and going
on a fucking treadmill they have because

920
00:52:09,241 --> 00:52:14,160
they're actors but the fucking the road.
The road man.

921
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,540
Yeah.
Nobody looks good.

922
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:19,680
Yeah. It looks like they told him nobody
to eat for days before you shoot. Yeah.

923
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,060
Pale and stressed out and like man this,

924
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:24,710
that would be the way to do it too.

925
00:52:24,711 --> 00:52:27,560
If you are going to be one of those
method guys and it was Gary Oldman

926
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:31,520
motherfuckers. Yeah, I bet he
would not eat for a couple days.

927
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:32,231
Yeah.

928
00:52:32,231 --> 00:52:35,320
I mean you don't eat and you drink a lot
of fucking coffee and you lose a lot of

929
00:52:35,321 --> 00:52:40,210
sleep and you get no a nice fatigued
state of stress because that's what it is.

930
00:52:40,211 --> 00:52:44,470
That's what it's going to be like, man.
It's going to be fucking pure stress.

931
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,500
You're probably going to die.
You're probably going to get arrested.

932
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:49,180
You're probably going to
watch your friend die.

933
00:52:49,181 --> 00:52:52,330
You're probably going to watch your
girlfriend get raped by some fucking super

934
00:52:52,331 --> 00:52:55,150
powerful you would do
or just like fuck it,

935
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:59,590
and it's not going to be like the
criminals that you see on Mad Max,

936
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,440
they're going to be dumber than those.
It's just going to be dumb.

937
00:53:02,441 --> 00:53:05,320
People who have power,
just dumb people with a gun.

938
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,770
That's going to be the problem
when the fucking grid shuts down

939
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:15,230
and it is entirely within the
realm of possibility. It's ignored,

940
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:17,990
but it's entirely within
the realm of possibility.

941
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,540
This is so fragile.

942
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:25,220
We have a house made of
toothpicks and tissue paper.

943
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,990
It's on the edge of a cliff.
Yeah.

944
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:32,080
In relationship to how our civilization
is set up and structured for longevity

945
00:53:32,731 --> 00:53:37,590
in this incredible volatile galaxy,
and it's incredibly volatile solar system,

946
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:39,330
just the planet itself,

947
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:43,050
all the natural shit that
can go down and on top of it,

948
00:53:43,051 --> 00:53:46,140
other done fucking shit that
we're doing like nuclear power.

949
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:50,150
Let me tell you something, dude.
People are fucking assholes.

950
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:53,500
Walking proof of that.
Go check out the dark ages.

951
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:56,950
Go look at what the Catholic Church did.
The RSPS.

952
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,060
This is where it gets crazy
about the Catholic church.

953
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:04,490
The Catholic church molested our
species when they were in their teens,

954
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:08,090
when, when our species was just
fucking getting shit going.

955
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,830
That Catholic Church came in and just
started torching people burning people,

956
00:54:12,831 --> 00:54:17,210
killing people left and right,
wiping out entire civilizations,

957
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:22,390
all in the name of Jesus and all of this
from an interpretation of the fucking,

958
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:24,780
uh, New Testament, uh,

959
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:27,740
which is Pauline theology from
a guy who never met Christ.

960
00:54:27,741 --> 00:54:31,850
And some people speculate, uh, the
real disciples thought he was a liar.

961
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,900
Call them a liar,
called the Paul Liar,

962
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:37,340
which is why when you look
at the pistols from Powell,

963
00:54:37,341 --> 00:54:40,760
a lot of times he's defending himself.
He's like, I'm not a lot. I mean,

964
00:54:40,761 --> 00:54:44,840
why would you say this to me? Because
the real disciples were like, hey dude,

965
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:46,280
who the fuck are you?

966
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:49,160
So he was like a late night
infomercial sales, right?

967
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:50,880
There you go.
Exactly.

968
00:54:50,881 --> 00:54:54,090
And that shit got adopted by the Roman
Empire because they wanted to go to war

969
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,490
and they just were like, yeah,
let's use this. We can use this.

970
00:54:56,491 --> 00:55:01,140
Let's figure out a way to make love your
neighbor as yourself and love the Lord

971
00:55:01,141 --> 00:55:02,310
your God with all your heart,
mind,

972
00:55:02,311 --> 00:55:06,420
and soul and to going into the Middle
East and stealing all their goal.

973
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:11,280
Let's figure out how to do that.
Oh, I know. Here's an idea.

974
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,140
I know there are events.

975
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:16,500
Let's go over there and kill the mother
fuckers and the name of the guy who said

976
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:17,910
don't kill anybody.

977
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:19,000
No,
I've had this,

978
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,600
I had this really intense series of
conversations with people about conspiracy

979
00:55:23,601 --> 00:55:24,434
theories lately,

980
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:28,640
both pro and con like having Brian Cowen
and doesn't believe in any conspiracy

981
00:55:28,641 --> 00:55:31,910
theory and Eddie Bravo who believes
in a lot of conspiracy theories,

982
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:35,900
but the most fascinating thing to me
is how many people will just blatantly

983
00:55:35,901 --> 00:55:38,900
dismiss conspiracy theories like,

984
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,450
like nine 11 is my favorite one.

985
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:46,630
You cannot dismiss nine 11 as a conspiracy
theory because it was a conspiracy

986
00:55:49,101 --> 00:55:52,940
that caused nine 11 from the
enemy in the first place. Okay.

987
00:55:52,941 --> 00:55:57,941
Someone conspired some big event
and made some human beings,

988
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:01,850
made planes fly into buildings
and a bunch of people died.

989
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:03,390
That is a fact.

990
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:08,540
The idea that that no one
could conspire to do that.

991
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:10,640
It's ridiculous because it had to be,

992
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,660
it had to be a conspiracy in order
for it to happen in the first place.

993
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,240
It's a lot of people involved.
They had to keep their mouth shut.

994
00:56:17,241 --> 00:56:20,540
They had a pass information
through in jpeg form.

995
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:24,190
They would fucking send things to each
other by sending each innocuous looking

996
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:27,920
emails with pictures in them and then
people would take those pictures and open

997
00:56:27,921 --> 00:56:32,200
them up in in a program that would allow
to see writing in between the ones and

998
00:56:32,201 --> 00:56:33,220
Zeros of the image.

999
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:37,250
Yes, and you might come up that. Here's
the thing, I always, it's pretty dope.

1000
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:41,030
I always look at this shift from the
perspective of like whenever you get to be

1001
00:56:41,031 --> 00:56:44,120
in at any kind of corporation,
if you go to a high enough level,

1002
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:47,980
you realize that people stop following
the same rules that everybody writes.

1003
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:49,510
File it. Like, I can remember,

1004
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:54,020
I used to work at this summer camp in
North Carolina, um, called camp panicle.

1005
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:57,530
And I can remember like I went to,
I went to camp there too as a camper.

1006
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:00,500
But I can remember at one point,
um,

1007
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:05,000
I can remember at one point at being a
counselor and then like the people who

1008
00:57:05,001 --> 00:57:08,360
ran the camp came during the time when
all the kids are supposed to be taking

1009
00:57:08,361 --> 00:57:09,800
naps to my cat. I'm like, Hey, come on.

1010
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:13,340
And then we went out in the lake and just
floated on inner tubes and I was like,

1011
00:57:13,341 --> 00:57:14,780
fuck,
this is breaking all the rules.

1012
00:57:14,781 --> 00:57:17,930
But it's the people running again
breaking the rules. So it's totally cool.

1013
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:22,340
But that's tiny,
tiny Mike my sample.

1014
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:26,450
But it's the same thing all over
the place up top where it's like,

1015
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:30,410
look dude, don't worry about
that cocaine charge. Like, oh,

1016
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,140
how much do you owe in taxes? Don't worry
about that. We'll take care of that.

1017
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:33,300
Right.

1018
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:36,210
Well how about when presidents leave
office and then dismiss a whole bunch of

1019
00:57:36,211 --> 00:57:40,320
people who these pardons
presidents are allowed? Like,

1020
00:57:40,321 --> 00:57:42,180
just give wide open pardon stuff,

1021
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:44,880
gang of people for doing all
kinds of creepy shit. Yeah.

1022
00:57:44,881 --> 00:57:47,520
Why did they get to do that? You
know, it's a crazy rule. You,

1023
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:51,750
you get to bypass the whole legal
system and they have like a list.

1024
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:55,350
It's not just one person. Like
they have a, they have a personal,

1025
00:57:55,351 --> 00:57:58,680
cause there was a guy who was unjustly
cues and I think this man needs to be

1026
00:57:58,681 --> 00:58:02,460
pardoned and no, no, no, no.
It's not that. There's a list.

1027
00:58:02,461 --> 00:58:05,730
They get like 20 or 30 of them
or something crazy. Oh sure man.

1028
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,820
How many do they get to a pardon? I don't
have it there. I'm just not that bad.

1029
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:12,140
It's not bad. There's some fucking checks
coming in though, because I feel like,

1030
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,330
I feel like somebody is abused
it recently. Like maybe Clinton,

1031
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:20,280
how many presidents,
how many pardons does the president get?

1032
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,340
Cause that would it be,
yeah, the guy. This keyboard

1033
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:27,310
sucks. That's crazy though,
man. That is crazy. So yeah,

1034
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:30,490
I think fucking conspiracies happen
because they happen in the smallest levels

1035
00:58:30,491 --> 00:58:33,120
of society. Why wouldn't they happen
at the highest levels in society?

1036
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:37,330
Yeah, totally. Yeah, of course, man.

1037
00:58:37,331 --> 00:58:38,490
It's everywhere you go man.

1038
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:42,710
People like are operating under the
illusion that politicians are honest or

1039
00:58:42,711 --> 00:58:43,544
don't like

1040
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:46,890
presidents can pardon as
many people as they want

1041
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:50,530
so they could pardon everyone?
God Dang, you were the president.

1042
00:58:50,531 --> 00:58:55,120
Like if Obama got pissed and went out
of office is the last attack he can be

1043
00:58:55,121 --> 00:59:00,121
like I'm pardoning every prisoner
in every prison over the counter.

1044
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:02,120
Yo Dude sweat this.

1045
00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:07,310
President Clinton issued 456
executive clemency orders,

1046
00:59:07,311 --> 00:59:12,311
395 pardons and 61 confrontations between
93 and January 20th of 2001 President

1047
00:59:17,541 --> 00:59:21,410
Bush has 191 pardons.

1048
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:27,200
Jimmy Carter granted amnesty
to all Vietnam era draft
Dodgers. Wow, that's cool.

1049
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:28,190
That's pretty beautiful.

1050
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:30,150
So Obama,
when he gets out of office,

1051
00:59:30,151 --> 00:59:33,090
he could pardon all people in
there for medical marijuana

1052
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:37,360
dodged the draft in Vietnam.
Ted Nugent.

1053
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:42,750
It's Kinda crazy cause just like he's
such a pro war guy, but there's a,

1054
00:59:42,751 --> 00:59:46,690
a depiction of what he did. I
don't know if it's true, but uh,

1055
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:51,700
I mean he definitely didn't go to war
and now he's like super pro war as he's

1056
00:59:51,701 --> 00:59:56,530
gotten older pro or is it a weird
stance? Well, the idea of pro America,

1057
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:59,200
I mean, look, if we really were
living in the game of Thrones,

1058
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:01,580
you better be fucking pro America.
You know,

1059
01:00:01,581 --> 01:00:05,960
you better be like down for this one team
because otherwise some Dothraki horde

1060
01:00:05,961 --> 01:00:08,710
from the other side of the world might
fucking hop on a ship and come over and

1061
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,350
Jack.
Yet it was very important back then.

1062
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:14,350
But as we're connected by the Internet,

1063
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:18,370
the idea of countries is
becoming less and less relevant.

1064
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:23,450
It's all about local
government laws and the,

1065
01:00:23,451 --> 01:00:27,820
the whole world is one big
fucking connection. The
whole world is one big piece.

1066
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:30,310
That's why all these people in
the Middle East are freaking out.

1067
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:34,780
That the real rally and cry for
freedom is coming from the Internet.

1068
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:38,080
That's how the use the Twitter and they
using Facebook to communicate with and

1069
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,750
all that's all emanating
from the Internet.

1070
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,330
Oh Man, I heard this thing
and I like, I never read it.

1071
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:47,450
I think a teacher told me
this and I never explored it.

1072
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:48,980
I'm sure I'll find out now though,

1073
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:54,220
but it was this idea that about communism
and how Karl Marx said that real

1074
01:00:54,411 --> 01:00:59,130
communism was going to be a natural
evolution of society and a real communism,

1075
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:02,120
not something imposed. Right.
Something that's just a natural,

1076
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:07,180
obvious result of people getting smarter
and I'm understanding the way things

1077
01:01:07,191 --> 01:01:07,870
work

1078
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:10,870
and calming it.
Money aids and a lot of things.

1079
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:13,930
What it does is it gives you
an incentive to innovate.

1080
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:17,920
It gives you an incentive to work hard.
It gives you something to show a score,

1081
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:21,190
which a lot of people like to
see if you want innovation. Yeah,

1082
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:25,110
right. I'm not, I'm definitely need,
certainly not a communist. I know,

1083
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:29,680
I know you're not, I'm not, I'm
definitely not anti money, but what, what,

1084
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:34,770
what I'm starting to see happening is
that the more that you work and like

1085
01:01:36,191 --> 01:01:40,780
little collectives with people, the more
you help the people around you, you know,

1086
01:01:40,781 --> 01:01:43,720
as much as you can,
just the people directly around you,

1087
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:47,670
the more that group rises up and succeeds.
Right.

1088
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:51,280
And this idea of the new form
of like podcast networks,

1089
01:01:51,281 --> 01:01:56,020
which is where you have like, um,
like, uh, like, like my friend,

1090
01:01:56,021 --> 01:01:59,020
he's doing a podcast network
called feral audio and ideas.

1091
01:01:59,021 --> 01:02:01,100
It's just a group of people that are like,
uh,

1092
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:04,960
plugging in together and like sharing,
sharing profits.

1093
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:09,470
This is the new model of things.
It's a collective, right?
Artists and people. Yeah.

1094
01:02:09,610 --> 01:02:09,941
You know,

1095
01:02:09,941 --> 01:02:14,941
I mean I'm not sure if the podcast world
represents a microcosm of the entire,

1096
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:18,850
no. Well No, no, no. So here's the
thing. This is what's beautiful

1097
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:19,990
about,
and this is why I bring it up

1098
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:20,823
is a new thing.

1099
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:25,810
The reason that it's the reason we can
do podcasts and the reason like you,

1100
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:29,760
like you just shot your own special on
your own and the re like seeing comedian

1101
01:02:29,761 --> 01:02:33,690
shoot there on, on special honors because
we have more access to technology,

1102
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:36,750
right. Then we have before and
technology shrinking, eating smaller,

1103
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:41,250
which is basically creating a situation
where collectives form instead of the

1104
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:43,050
pyramid Illuminati,

1105
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:48,051
top down power structure where
someone owns the equipment and gets a,

1106
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:51,180
the majority of the dub.
Do you know what I'm saying?

1107
01:02:51,181 --> 01:02:54,960
It's like everything's shifting,
widening out, spreading out. And that's,

1108
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:57,960
that's why these fucking
tyrants in the Middle East,

1109
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:01,990
it doesn't work when people
have information. Right.
Doesn't work well. You know,

1110
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:04,770
I've always, I remembered, uh,

1111
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:07,650
when they were talking to Muhammad
Ali because when I was a kid,

1112
01:03:07,651 --> 01:03:12,570
I remember when he had gotten, um,
when he had a fraught Michael Spinks,

1113
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,700
it was on television.
It was like a big deal.

1114
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,340
I remember my parents were trying
to explain to me when I was a kid,

1115
01:03:17,341 --> 01:03:19,890
like what had happened did,
they'd kept him from fighting.

1116
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:23,100
Like my parents wanted to see him fight.
Let my,

1117
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,500
I can't believe my parents
were into fighting at all,

1118
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:28,960
but they'd want him to see Muhammad
Ali beat Leon Spinks. Yeah,

1119
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:31,150
there's like some
important fight and there,

1120
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:33,990
there are dealers at this
guy was like a cultural hero.

1121
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:37,080
Cause what he had done was
stepped up and said it,

1122
01:03:37,081 --> 01:03:41,610
why would I shoot with a guy in Vietnam?
No Vietnam man ever did anything to me.

1123
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:45,330
And he's right. And he was 100% right.
And everybody knew it and it made sense.

1124
01:03:45,331 --> 01:03:45,961
And because of that,

1125
01:03:45,961 --> 01:03:49,440
they punished him and they wouldn't let
him box for three years. Right. You know,

1126
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:53,460
they took away his livelihood in the
prime of his career. Like physically.

1127
01:03:54,310 --> 01:03:57,940
Yeah. His, well, this, that, that
phenomenon that you just described,

1128
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:01,870
it's been going on since
the history of chocolate.

1129
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:05,740
I've top down power structures.
I, this book I'm reading
now, I can't run the name.

1130
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:09,040
It's so fucking good, but
it's got, um, uh, you know,

1131
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:14,040
a picture of Copernicus standing
before like Catholic hope's,

1132
01:04:14,410 --> 01:04:15,243
um,

1133
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:20,110
and being judged for talking about the
fact that the earth revolves around the

1134
01:04:20,111 --> 01:04:21,760
sun.
You know,

1135
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:27,060
it's like people say the truth throughout
history and many people have gone to

1136
01:04:28,451 --> 01:04:30,600
jail or going to burn it. The
fucking state for it. Yeah.

1137
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,870
Oh,
that's true.

1138
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:39,770
I think the last time I drank this
energy drink, it's pretty mellow,

1139
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:43,530
pretty mellow for an energy drink.
It's like a lot of it is natural.

1140
01:04:43,531 --> 01:04:46,380
It's like the 12 in it and shit.
These guys sponsor, you know,

1141
01:04:46,381 --> 01:04:51,030
it's just a friend of mine,
Ryan White, powerful. I'm
right. My friend Tom Atencio,

1142
01:04:51,031 --> 01:04:55,000
he, uh, used to run affliction and he
was the guy who put together the, or,

1143
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:58,740
or one of the guys who put together their
mixed martial arts cards that they had.

1144
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:02,820
And I always appreciated that. But he
did that and they, you know, affliction,

1145
01:05:02,821 --> 01:05:03,750
support MMA.

1146
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:07,980
So I became friends with him and I was
wearing their shirts for a little while,

1147
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:11,610
but then they fired him. So I
quit. Out of respect for my friend,

1148
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:15,750
I avoided my, uh, my
partnership with them. So,

1149
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:19,870
but so he sends me soda now. He's cool.
He's cool as fuck. He's a good dude.

1150
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:25,870
I just really respected what
he and his company did for MMA.

1151
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:30,790
They really supportive a lot of fighters.
They, they um, they supported a lot of,

1152
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:35,320
uh, of uh, fighters by promoting,
um, they put on actual shows.

1153
01:05:35,321 --> 01:05:38,920
They had I think three big shows,
you know,

1154
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:41,920
and some of them were fucking great,
great fights.

1155
01:05:41,921 --> 01:05:43,390
They put together some wild fights,

1156
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:46,210
but they just found out
it's way too expensive.

1157
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:50,950
People don't realize how much money
the UFC spends behind the scenes,

1158
01:05:50,951 --> 01:05:54,130
like how much it costs to keep
the machine running. It's a,

1159
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,410
it's an amazing amount of work.

1160
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:58,420
There's so many people
behind the scenes and they,

1161
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:02,370
all of them have a long history and
the UFC has this big name, you know?

1162
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:06,280
It's hard to fuck with that. It's like
to try to make a rival football league,

1163
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:10,360
even if you have a lot of talent. He kept
van. Everybody knows what the NFL is,

1164
01:06:10,361 --> 01:06:12,550
you know? They tried that shit a
couple of times. They tried to,

1165
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:15,240
with the XFL member
was like Vince Mcmahon,

1166
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:18,840
the wrestling guy and tried to do that.
It's hard. It's hard to get people to,

1167
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:19,250
you know,

1168
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:24,250
and the UFC is consistent with the
getting the best talent consistently

1169
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:28,620
get the best talent. What's her
name? Oh yeah. Ronda Rousey.

1170
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:31,680
The girl who walks around with a number.
Oh area.

1171
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:37,410
You're like, hey, I got a perfect face.

1172
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:43,200
Perfect. Her face is just, she's
a flawless face. It's like, wow,

1173
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,080
what's really funny about watching her?

1174
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:50,830
And she's gotten down this casual wave
to the hordes of pervs. He wears screen.

1175
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:57,280
It's like an apocalypse now
by the sea,

1176
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:01,270
a testosterone. She got this little
side like two finger wave like God.

1177
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:04,960
Do you remember that scene? That was a
great fucking similar apocalypse now.

1178
01:07:05,770 --> 01:07:09,880
That was, that seems so real. Totally
real man. If you'd ever seen it,

1179
01:07:09,881 --> 01:07:13,670
what happens is these guys were over
there fighting. It war its own men.

1180
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:14,830
There's thousands of them.

1181
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:19,060
They fly in these playboy playmates and
they were like dancing around on stage

1182
01:07:19,061 --> 01:07:23,320
and it just gets angry. It's, it's just
a, it becomes like a mosh pit of gorillas.

1183
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:24,450
I know.
Eventually they have to

1184
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:28,150
ended and fucking fly out of there.
That was one of the best.

1185
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:33,540
I want to get left behind that
scene. I don't remember. I should,

1186
01:07:33,541 --> 01:07:35,700
I don't remember.
Can I ask an important question?

1187
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:40,710
I think a lot of UFC fans wonder
this every day and me included Eric,

1188
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,560
what's her name?
Does she have a boyfriend?

1189
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:47,160
I do not know if she currently
has a boyfriend. I do not know

1190
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:53,720
what we're dying to know because we
all feel like everyone has a shot

1191
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:57,320
bombed on buy.

1192
01:07:57,530 --> 01:08:02,480
I can't buy print it bombed down by
the Rothchild. She gets bombed out.

1193
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:06,420
That people who like transforming to a
rep telling in front of her here take a

1194
01:08:06,421 --> 01:08:07,200
diamond.

1195
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:11,580
She wouldn't do this, but if she wanted
to she wouldn't. But if she wanted to,

1196
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,190
she's the type of check tick and
get some like Middle East King,

1197
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:18,440
fly her out for like 1 million bucks.
Easy. Yeah. Easy million bucks a night.

1198
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:24,280
Fuck him for 10 million. Yeah. I mean
when you, when you have a choice,

1199
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,170
if you have 1 trillion bucks,
like,

1200
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:31,100
well from what I understand is like royal
families that have so much money and

1201
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:34,730
there it's not, they're not, the money's
not public. Like when people look at like,

1202
01:08:34,731 --> 01:08:39,020
who's like the richest man in the world?
Oh, it's Bill Gates as it's probably not.

1203
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:41,420
It's actually probably some
dude in the Middle East.

1204
01:08:41,421 --> 01:08:44,450
It doesn't talk about it at all. And
you don't know. Some prints are like,

1205
01:08:44,451 --> 01:08:49,100
they have extraordinary amounts of money
and I don't think that a lot of times

1206
01:08:49,101 --> 01:08:52,520
it gets measured up in the same pile.
I might be wrong about that,

1207
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:57,440
but from what people have
told me about like, like real,

1208
01:08:57,441 --> 01:08:59,090
real wealthy people in the Middle East,

1209
01:08:59,091 --> 01:09:03,200
there's some of the wealthiest people
on earth is that it's like insane,

1210
01:09:03,201 --> 01:09:04,640
staggering amounts of wealth.

1211
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:05,230
So fun.

1212
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:08,500
The thing I like to think about is like
maybe you know like when you walk by a

1213
01:09:08,501 --> 01:09:11,470
school and you see all the
kids playing in the playground,

1214
01:09:11,471 --> 01:09:13,660
some of them are fucking
playing like four squares.

1215
01:09:13,661 --> 01:09:16,840
Some of them are running around playing
tag and they're just having a blast.

1216
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:19,390
Sometimes I think maybe
that's what society is.

1217
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:24,460
Maybe you were just like kids playing
around in this playground that's been

1218
01:09:24,461 --> 01:09:27,640
created by really,
really smart,

1219
01:09:27,641 --> 01:09:32,641
super wealthy people and kind of watching
watch maybe like maybe they have some

1220
01:09:32,981 --> 01:09:33,761
fun with us.

1221
01:09:33,761 --> 01:09:36,520
They like throw shit in there every
once in a while just to play around.

1222
01:09:36,521 --> 01:09:39,890
But there is so fucking powerful and rich.
They're not,

1223
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:43,210
they don't need to go in there and like
seem like they're famous or act like

1224
01:09:43,211 --> 01:09:45,280
they're magical. They just
like to watch. It's fun.

1225
01:09:45,490 --> 01:09:48,520
Every once in a while they'll
throw in something crazy. You know,

1226
01:09:48,521 --> 01:09:52,060
every once in a while they'll
throw in the aids virus or toss it.

1227
01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:54,620
Well, boom. Have power for no reason,

1228
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:58,530
which essentially everyone at the
very top of the, the heat pads Po,

1229
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,980
there's no reason why you
should have power. Okay? Now,

1230
01:10:00,981 --> 01:10:02,870
if you have power for s for no reason,

1231
01:10:02,871 --> 01:10:07,190
you know that it's not like you earned
your power through your basketball

1232
01:10:07,191 --> 01:10:08,024
skills.

1233
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:11,600
You know the fact that you shoot us a
wicked three pointer or you are awesome at

1234
01:10:11,601 --> 01:10:12,620
the violin.
No,

1235
01:10:12,621 --> 01:10:17,621
there's no real tangible skill that you
present that anybody else couldn't also

1236
01:10:17,991 --> 01:10:19,040
have.
You know what I mean?

1237
01:10:19,041 --> 01:10:21,920
What is vague characteristics
like leadership and intelligence,

1238
01:10:21,921 --> 01:10:25,280
the ability to speak well.
God Damn, there's a lot of
people that have bad shake.

1239
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:25,851
Yeah,
there's,

1240
01:10:25,851 --> 01:10:29,630
there's thousands of people out there
in your neighborhood that can do that.

1241
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:30,200
Okay.

1242
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:35,200
So they know that you have to be
treacherous in order to retain this power.

1243
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:39,830
When we see different laws every
day that it'd been brought up,

1244
01:10:39,831 --> 01:10:42,680
like the National Defense Authorization
Act, all this on the different stuff.

1245
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:45,680
All when you see like civil liberties
giving you a road and you see corruption

1246
01:10:45,681 --> 01:10:46,370
that he wrote,

1247
01:10:46,370 --> 01:10:50,510
there's your evidence that that is the
exact evidence that you need to know that

1248
01:10:50,511 --> 01:10:54,380
the people better in a position of power
shouldn't be empowered to trying to get

1249
01:10:54,381 --> 01:10:58,400
more and more and more control. Why are
you trying to get more and more control?

1250
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:01,790
Why are you actively trying to get
control instead of dealing with the issues

1251
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:05,180
that we already have? Dealing with the
crime that we already have dealing with,

1252
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:07,370
you know,
are unsolved murders or what have you.

1253
01:11:07,371 --> 01:11:09,440
Instead of devoting your time into that,

1254
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:14,680
into that aspect of helping society with
law instead that you're trying to take

1255
01:11:14,761 --> 01:11:18,150
away civil liberties,
you trying to erode people's freedoms.

1256
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:22,140
That's the purest sign ever that the
people who are in a position of power

1257
01:11:22,141 --> 01:11:25,380
shouldn't be in a position of power.
It's really sad. It's pure, it's pure.

1258
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:28,470
There's no arguing, there's no
denying it. Obama can never deny it.

1259
01:11:28,471 --> 01:11:30,090
If he brought it up to him,
there's nothing he could say.

1260
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,820
There's no way anybody could
save for your own good.

1261
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:36,660
When you did take away your ability
to send a private email to somebody,

1262
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:38,040
we can't.
You can't have that.

1263
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:40,110
Well,
what they say is they inevitably,

1264
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:42,960
one thing that they'll always
say is it's complicated.

1265
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:45,540
It's a very complex system.
You don't understand.

1266
01:11:45,541 --> 01:11:48,630
There's a lot more to it than
just legalizing marijuana.

1267
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:53,790
There's a lot more to it, Joe. It's always
complicated. Vampires love complication.

1268
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:58,350
They love tangles and complexity and the
opposite of simplicity simply because

1269
01:11:58,351 --> 01:12:01,290
they, you know why? Cause
they fucking hate the truth.

1270
01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:05,430
And the truth is always simple. The
truth is always just a very simple thing.

1271
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:09,290
It's a, you know, you jump off a
cliff, you're going to die. It's,

1272
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:12,210
if you fucking don't eat, you're
going to be hungry. There's just some,

1273
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:15,810
it's a tweet. The truth is a
tweet. Yeah, fucking vampires.

1274
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:20,960
They will take a truth and they'll
transform it and extrapolate so much shit

1275
01:12:21,421 --> 01:12:24,780
from it that it turns into a fucking lie.
And then let's say, you know, we can't,

1276
01:12:24,781 --> 01:12:27,930
it's just too tangled up the world's
economies just too confusing.

1277
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:30,030
This is why we've got
to exploit these people.

1278
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:34,230
This is why we've got to throw farmers
in jail. Cause it's complicated.

1279
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:38,220
This is why we're at war. We can't
just not go to work. It's complicated.

1280
01:12:38,221 --> 01:12:41,820
It's always complicated.
But in the, in real life,

1281
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:46,780
it's not complicated. There's nothing
fucking complicated about, uh,

1282
01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:49,410
you probably shouldn't throw bombs.

1283
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:52,080
Places where there's kids that's like,

1284
01:12:52,081 --> 01:12:55,560
if you see somebody throwing bombs
in a place where there's some kids,

1285
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:57,870
you're gonna be like, you know,
you probably shouldn't do that.

1286
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:04,440
Fucking kills kids. But like, when it's
no one knows what you don't understand.

1287
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:07,920
There's a target surgeons,
surgeons can be in that. Oh,

1288
01:13:07,921 --> 01:13:11,850
you mean fucking farmers who are sick
of you driving tanks through their opium

1289
01:13:11,851 --> 01:13:14,130
fields? Is that the insurgence
you're talking about?

1290
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:17,480
Are you seeing your original video
from Wiki leaks? Right. The, the,

1291
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:20,750
the cash collateral murder
video with the chose the,

1292
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:25,220
the helicopter shooting missiles and shit,
and to a car that has kids in it.

1293
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:28,000
Oh yeah. You know, and
someone says, this kid's well,

1294
01:13:28,690 --> 01:13:31,630
it shouldn't have been taking the kids.
What were they carrying guns. I mean,

1295
01:13:31,631 --> 01:13:32,860
and whatever the fuck they said,
you know,

1296
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:35,900
you shouldn't have any kids with you
because if they should have thought about

1297
01:13:35,901 --> 01:13:39,150
that since they're the enemy, they should,
uh, meanwhile they were innocent. They,

1298
01:13:39,151 --> 01:13:42,830
they shot a bunch of innocent people.
It was, it was a complete total cluster.

1299
01:13:42,831 --> 01:13:43,180
Fuck.

1300
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:46,600
Sure. It's not complicated. It's
a real simple thing about why,

1301
01:13:46,601 --> 01:13:48,430
if that's the thing, here's the
thing though, isn't it simple?

1302
01:13:48,431 --> 01:13:49,330
There's some simple ideas.
Yeah.

1303
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:51,180
You're not supposed to shoot
in the cars that have kids.

1304
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:54,430
You're not supposed to shoot in the
cars. I have kids in them. And also, uh,

1305
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:58,240
if you send out good energy into the
world, you give good energy back.

1306
01:13:58,330 --> 01:14:03,100
Here's another basic principle that you
can test all day testing next week. Just,

1307
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:05,910
well, they didn't even like
zoom room to see if fair,

1308
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:10,330
if the people do have guns
that they mean they, they just,

1309
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:14,920
they just Gundam down, man, I got to
have that ability and that kind of power,

1310
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,500
you know? And they're like, I,
you know, and they're saying, no,

1311
01:14:17,501 --> 01:14:20,660
we were pretty sure this guy's got a
gun and this guy's got a gun and they're

1312
01:14:20,661 --> 01:14:23,170
like a permission to engage
and they get permission.

1313
01:14:23,171 --> 01:14:25,870
They just fucking open up on
these people and that's it.

1314
01:14:25,871 --> 01:14:28,740
Those people don't exist anymore and it's,
it's,

1315
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,630
if we wouldn't even know that that
is happening and we don't even know.

1316
01:14:31,631 --> 01:14:34,930
Have you seen the new video,
the Blackwater video that's
been released recently,

1317
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,830
now the young Turks had
about him? That guy sank. Um,

1318
01:14:38,860 --> 01:14:43,510
I really liked that guy show. He's,
he's, uh, he's fucking fearless man.

1319
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:46,470
He attacks everything.
He attacks, uh, like,

1320
01:14:46,610 --> 01:14:49,270
like he goes after that Peter Schiff guy,

1321
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:54,270
you know Peter Shift when he starts
making excuses for Wall Street, you know,

1322
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:57,340
the way to fix this. And he's just
like, no, you use it and calls him out.

1323
01:14:57,341 --> 01:15:00,130
And he's like, you just want to keep
extracting more money from the system.

1324
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:03,310
You just want to keep
exceeding, know you're talking
bullshit. And he cut him off.

1325
01:15:03,610 --> 01:15:07,330
I liked it, man. It was interesting. But
he was talking about this and he was,

1326
01:15:08,410 --> 01:15:13,210
you know, he was talking about
how, um, what was the fucking law?

1327
01:15:13,950 --> 01:15:14,530
Yeah.

1328
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:17,350
What was the law that was passed?
Which one?

1329
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:20,213
Shit,

1330
01:15:21,330 --> 01:15:22,800
I'm completely lost my thought.

1331
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:28,360
What was his fucking thing about the
young Turk? Yeah. I didn't see it.

1332
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:33,510
Shit. God dammit. Well, I'll,

1333
01:15:33,511 --> 01:15:38,350
I'll remember in a moment. Let's rewind a
few steps back. All this macro shit, man.

1334
01:15:38,351 --> 01:15:39,460
Thinking about the macro,

1335
01:15:39,461 --> 01:15:42,730
the conspirator to drive me crazy if I
don't remember what this fucking gods

1336
01:15:42,731 --> 01:15:47,000
video was about. Oh, are
Rakhi. Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh,

1337
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:49,930
this is why it's so disturbing.
I'm probably trying to forget it.

1338
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:54,460
It was watching the
blackwater guys this young,

1339
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:58,540
the young Turks made a video about
this and exposed it and showed there's,

1340
01:15:58,570 --> 01:16:02,530
there's more videos had been released
that were like from the actual cars of the

1341
01:16:02,531 --> 01:16:05,980
guys in black water that we're driving
around smashing into people's cars.

1342
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:06,761
One of them,

1343
01:16:06,761 --> 01:16:10,630
they hit a lady while she was walking
across the street and you see the guy,

1344
01:16:10,631 --> 01:16:13,930
see the lady go down and go, oh
shit. And they just drive on.

1345
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:17,500
It just left her there and they're
smashed into people's cars.

1346
01:16:17,530 --> 01:16:20,920
They're sticking their guns out the window
and just randomly shooting and things.

1347
01:16:21,430 --> 01:16:24,550
It's right. It's really fucking crazy.
It's really crazy to watch Matt.

1348
01:16:24,670 --> 01:16:27,190
It's really crazy. And
that's enough. That's just,

1349
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:30,720
there's just no getting around
that you can't, you know,

1350
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,360
you were talking about like making the,

1351
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:36,040
that the Catholic religion or any kind
of crazy cult that wants to have some

1352
01:16:36,041 --> 01:16:39,310
sort of a justification for doing
something wrong. You're fucking wrong.

1353
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:41,500
We'll read you some huge,

1354
01:16:41,501 --> 01:16:45,940
huge volume tome on why it is that what
they're doing is the correct move for

1355
01:16:45,941 --> 01:16:49,810
everybody else in the long run. When you
show a video like that, is that correct?

1356
01:16:49,811 --> 01:16:54,310
Move using mercenaries, man. How
could you see how crazy this is?

1357
01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:57,520
You got people that are willing to kill
people for money and you're paying them

1358
01:16:57,521 --> 01:17:01,780
a fuck load of it and you're letting
them just run a no man. I mean,

1359
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:02,801
this is a,

1360
01:17:02,801 --> 01:17:07,801
this is a problem that will always exist
as long as power structures are trying

1361
01:17:10,110 --> 01:17:14,810
EULAR instead of circular. And, um,
and there's no way around that man.

1362
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:17,000
There's always just going to be that.
There's no way around that.

1363
01:17:17,001 --> 01:17:20,510
And the problem is when power
structures are triangular, they don't,

1364
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:23,960
usually the people at the top of that
fucking triangle, the pyramid, they don't,

1365
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:28,370
they won't listen to logic. They don't
care about what's right or what's wrong.

1366
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,670
They're not going to listen to you.
You have to take the power from the right.

1367
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:33,480
That's what the idea of the fucking right.

1368
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:36,710
Well they have to die off
too. That's the, that's how,

1369
01:17:36,810 --> 01:17:37,210
yeah,

1370
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:40,830
let's hope they die off because it's
been a few thousand years and they don't

1371
01:17:40,831 --> 01:17:43,170
seem to be going anywhere.
It's just going to take different forms.

1372
01:17:43,171 --> 01:17:47,280
They put on different masks and
admittedly the violence is lessening and

1373
01:17:47,281 --> 01:17:50,670
lessening. So maybe the violence will
dissipate two to nothing. I just,

1374
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:51,810
I had no idea,
man.

1375
01:17:51,811 --> 01:17:55,050
I've been reading this fucking book
about what the God named Catholics did.

1376
01:17:55,051 --> 01:17:58,520
Did the fucking Cathars is what
they were called Wikipedia.

1377
01:17:58,570 --> 01:18:03,030
That thought has just got exterminated
by the Catholic church is burn at the

1378
01:18:03,031 --> 01:18:05,480
fucking state man for,
for uh,

1379
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:10,200
believing a different version of
Christianity. It could have been a threat.

1380
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:12,140
Well,
this is a long time ago obviously.

1381
01:18:12,141 --> 01:18:16,760
It's just amazing that in 2012 after all
the time and all the supposed to shit

1382
01:18:16,761 --> 01:18:20,780
that we had learned from the dark ages
and today even still you've got this

1383
01:18:20,781 --> 01:18:21,591
video released,

1384
01:18:21,591 --> 01:18:25,970
this blackwater video of people just
going to a foreign land and just fucking

1385
01:18:25,971 --> 01:18:30,370
people up. You know it's the, that is the,

1386
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:31,273
at the very,

1387
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:36,400
the very peak of our society when it comes
to like causing change and damage and

1388
01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:42,860
that is like the highest,
most impactful part of our world is war,

1389
01:18:42,861 --> 01:18:43,370
right?

1390
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:48,370
Most as far as like destruction and as
far as like that's like society at its

1391
01:18:48,411 --> 01:18:53,411
breaking point or its boiling point and
it seems to stay at that same level.

1392
01:18:54,770 --> 01:18:56,870
It seems to stay at that same level.
We're,

1393
01:18:56,890 --> 01:18:59,660
we're always just that close
to fucking everything up.

1394
01:18:59,661 --> 01:19:02,960
We're always that close and like as good
as it ever got was like when Clinton

1395
01:19:02,961 --> 01:19:05,180
was in office, didn't really seem
like we're going to run anymore.

1396
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:08,930
Seems like the Soviet Union
kind of falling apart and
we're the only big dog in

1397
01:19:08,931 --> 01:19:10,850
town were pretty cool and we're not
going to fuck with anybody money.

1398
01:19:10,851 --> 01:19:14,490
So let's just, you know, it felt like
everything was going to be okay. Yep.

1399
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:18,530
But then it went right back up to its
boiling point and you realize that boiling

1400
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:22,340
point where we had with the Clinton
way important, that was unusual.

1401
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:27,380
That was unusual. The lack of threat of
imminent death. That's the unusual thing.

1402
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:28,720
This normal thing.

1403
01:19:28,721 --> 01:19:31,370
And we've gone through with the Bush
administration and we go through with the

1404
01:19:31,371 --> 01:19:34,400
Obama administration now that's,
that's unusual.

1405
01:19:34,690 --> 01:19:38,770
That is rather the norm did the unusual
thing is peace. The unusual thing is,

1406
01:19:38,771 --> 01:19:43,380
is prosperity and relaxation and not
worrying about fucking bombs dropping on

1407
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:45,800
overhead from the other side of the world.
Well

1408
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:48,200
it's, yeah, it's definitely normal one,

1409
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:52,730
the people who are making the laws and
apparently then paid off by people that

1410
01:19:52,731 --> 01:19:56,570
prosper from or it's totally normal then.

1411
01:19:57,080 --> 01:20:00,950
But it's amazing that it's, it's, it's
still pushed through. It's amazing.

1412
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:04,220
It's amazing that in this day
and age it can be so obvious.

1413
01:20:04,221 --> 01:20:07,170
It can be so laid out and yet
still gets pushed through.

1414
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,430
Here's what it's fucking amazing.

1415
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:13,460
What's amazing is there's somebody
in a corporation that has to have war

1416
01:20:14,071 --> 01:20:17,970
happening or they're going to go bankrupt.
That's what's amazing.

1417
01:20:17,971 --> 01:20:20,560
There's people who like, man,
we gotta get some wars do it. Or

1418
01:20:20,830 --> 01:20:24,700
our division is strictly
missile reconstruction.

1419
01:20:25,810 --> 01:20:28,480
We're not blowing up missiles and then
we're not reconstruct the areas where

1420
01:20:28,481 --> 01:20:32,060
missiles destroyed. Yeah,
that's it. Yeah, exactly. Dude.

1421
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:35,050
That's what they're thinking when they,

1422
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,900
when they hear that piece might be coming.
That's like,

1423
01:20:37,930 --> 01:20:42,280
that's hearing that a fucking, uh, to go
bankrupt. Do you think there's calls like,

1424
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:43,010
Hey,
oh,

1425
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:48,010
I heard that y'all are running a surplus
on a certain muscle that we're about to

1426
01:20:48,701 --> 01:20:50,110
go into construction on it.

1427
01:20:50,111 --> 01:20:53,110
We don't want to come out with version
two while y'all still got version one

1428
01:20:53,111 --> 01:20:55,990
going around and you think you can make
some campaigns where you could put those

1429
01:20:55,991 --> 01:20:59,790
bad boys to use. Do you think that, uh,

1430
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,570
I was like a fucking Robert Downey jr
contractor character could call somebody

1431
01:21:04,571 --> 01:21:06,960
up and ask him to launch the missiles.
You know?

1432
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:09,410
Do you think when that was the
sons of bitches and manufacturer,

1433
01:21:09,411 --> 01:21:12,550
that Shit Watch more footage on the
news. They're like, Oh hell yeah,

1434
01:21:12,551 --> 01:21:17,470
that's a bean. That's my boy. That's
my, that's the child shredder.

1435
01:21:17,471 --> 01:21:22,120
Hell yeah. Look at that thing. Look
at a spread on that bomb. Hell yeah.

1436
01:21:22,121 --> 01:21:24,670
Every time they see that they're
like Ching, Ching, Cha Ching.

1437
01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:27,700
Every time a bomb goes off they're
like, yeah, that's a hundred grand.

1438
01:21:27,701 --> 01:21:29,230
Hundred grand. Hundred grand. Yeah.

1439
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,640
What about dudes that are
like never been to war,

1440
01:21:31,641 --> 01:21:36,641
but they're like obsessed with like
soldier Fortune magazine or on protection

1441
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:40,520
fucking, you know, packing
heat ever where they go. Yeah.

1442
01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:44,650
They live in the wild west in the back of
their head. Dude, I gotta tell you man,

1443
01:21:44,651 --> 01:21:48,130
I think I got the potential to be like
that would be his man. Cause like I, yeah,

1444
01:21:48,131 --> 01:21:51,250
cause I like it's an equalizer.
That's why people like it. If you,

1445
01:21:51,251 --> 01:21:55,780
if you feel like you've been put in a
situation where you could have been in

1446
01:21:55,781 --> 01:21:59,140
danger physically because some asshole
wanted to fuck you up and they could have

1447
01:21:59,141 --> 01:22:01,690
done that to you, you know, that's
a terrible, terrible feeling.

1448
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,090
So once you've experienced
that terrible feeling,

1449
01:22:04,091 --> 01:22:05,500
you only have some sort of an equal,

1450
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:07,980
nothing wrong with it, man. I really,

1451
01:22:07,981 --> 01:22:11,100
I mean it seems so weird cause I know
I come off as this kind of like hippie

1452
01:22:11,101 --> 01:22:11,371
dude,

1453
01:22:11,371 --> 01:22:16,050
but I was raised in the South Man and my
dad taught me to how to be safe with a

1454
01:22:16,051 --> 01:22:19,380
gun. Taught me off on it was the
shoot a gun taught me like, you know,

1455
01:22:19,381 --> 01:22:21,720
it took me hunting and like
I'm not afraid of guns.

1456
01:22:21,721 --> 01:22:25,320
I think they're fucking awesome man.
They're really cool. I just don't, I,

1457
01:22:25,321 --> 01:22:28,050
I haven't gotten around to buying one,
um,

1458
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:31,260
in La and not if it feels
like there's this, you know,

1459
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:34,320
we were talking about this around
Diaz and he was saying like,

1460
01:22:34,321 --> 01:22:36,300
it'll attract guns.

1461
01:22:36,301 --> 01:22:40,830
Like it's a lot of people think that
they think that if you have the weapon,

1462
01:22:41,010 --> 01:22:45,650
it will act as some kind of magnet
for negativity that will like bring,

1463
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:49,830
bring it to you. It's a superstitious
idea, but some part of me, oh my gosh,

1464
01:22:49,831 --> 01:22:52,050
it may be so a man. Right? I don't know.

1465
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:55,560
Maybe I should just ignore it and I have
a gun because I mean, I, I, I can't,

1466
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:59,700
I doubt anyone's, well, you
never know, man. You never know.

1467
01:22:59,701 --> 01:23:02,130
Somebody could just decide to
fucking kicking your door in,

1468
01:23:02,131 --> 01:23:05,350
like take your shit and
fucking stab you to death.

1469
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:09,970
People do get robbed. There are home
invasions. People do scope people out.

1470
01:23:09,971 --> 01:23:13,930
It doesn't happen. Doesn't
happen that often. Well, the,
what's really going on, man,

1471
01:23:13,931 --> 01:23:15,970
is it, there's so many
fucking people on this planet.

1472
01:23:15,971 --> 01:23:19,900
You're hearing about so many different
violent acts. Even in bad neighborhoods,

1473
01:23:19,901 --> 01:23:23,010
violent acts are fairly rare. No. Well,

1474
01:23:23,090 --> 01:23:25,720
it might be a million people in one
of them gets shot a day. It sucks.

1475
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:31,030
You wanted a million. Not a lot. I mean,
it's not, it's not a little, you know,

1476
01:23:31,031 --> 01:23:32,130
when you think about it that way,

1477
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:34,070
sexy, this is the society we live in, man.

1478
01:23:34,071 --> 01:23:36,260
This is where we've hit
upon in the multiverse.

1479
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:39,290
Cause like he got all the other things
that people can break into your house and

1480
01:23:39,291 --> 01:23:43,910
do like what a great dimension where
like fucking hot chick sometimes swarm

1481
01:23:43,911 --> 01:23:45,610
neighborhoods and just give random blood.
Right?

1482
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:48,240
Well what if you don't want a
random blowjob from a hot check?

1483
01:23:48,241 --> 01:23:51,690
What have you trying to like control
your sperm and you're on this Dalai Lama

1484
01:23:51,691 --> 01:23:55,710
type journey and some hot chick breaks
into his house and sucks his dick and

1485
01:23:55,711 --> 01:23:57,180
ruins this whole spiritual journey.

1486
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,890
Yeah.
What if you turn into a Zombie?

1487
01:23:58,891 --> 01:24:00,830
Like anyone's not going to
want a blow job from a high.

1488
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:04,880
He's going to realize that he wasted
his whole stupid life dressing up like a

1489
01:24:04,881 --> 01:24:07,940
genie when he could have been just
getting his dick sucked from the get go.

1490
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:13,070
The lesson yet is a good lesson. But you
can't force someone to have a lesson.

1491
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:16,160
Well, you can't rape the Dalai Lama.
I mean, that's what she'd be doing.

1492
01:24:16,161 --> 01:24:17,260
She'd be waving the poor guy.

1493
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:20,750
He couldn't help himself testing that
hot chicks going rape the dollar.

1494
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:23,450
Why am I want a woman that
hot stove stroking your cost.

1495
01:24:23,950 --> 01:24:27,110
You are not even in control. You're not
even in control it. You're a Zombie.

1496
01:24:27,111 --> 01:24:29,330
You what you are in Dna Zombie.

1497
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:32,670
You just trying to shoot DNA brains.

1498
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:36,860
You're just trying to shoot loads loads.
Just trying to get rid of that.

1499
01:24:36,890 --> 01:24:40,550
That ache in your balls. Oh,
what a terrible Dalai Lama.

1500
01:24:40,551 --> 01:24:44,570
The whole guys like means he's
a single sort of pudgy man,

1501
01:24:44,571 --> 01:24:47,480
kind of Asian character,
has a lot of really famous friends.

1502
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:50,710
You know it's kind of a name dropper.
Always hanging out with Richard.

1503
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:55,820
I'm not dissing him at all. I'm just
being honest about is what it looks like.

1504
01:24:55,940 --> 01:24:58,910
It'd be awesome if you would
that would rock is fucking world.

1505
01:24:58,911 --> 01:25:01,820
If some Megan Fox looking chick came
in and started talking to his cock,

1506
01:25:01,870 --> 01:25:04,700
that'd be awesome. Is that the
Dalai Lama fire back at you? Well,

1507
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:08,390
you got mad at me. I don't want, I don't
mean any disrespect to the dawn wall. No,

1508
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:09,500
fuck you Joe Rogan.

1509
01:25:09,670 --> 01:25:13,220
Oh would be crazy if I was the first
cattle Dalai Lama told to go fuck himself.

1510
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:14,900
Like wow,
I must be a deck.

1511
01:25:15,230 --> 01:25:17,990
I'm sure he's a great guy and I don't
think there's anything wrong with doing

1512
01:25:17,991 --> 01:25:20,760
life the way he's doing.
I just think it's when I,

1513
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:24,650
when I look at his life in comparison
to a wife that I would find interesting,

1514
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:28,520
I'm like, come on man. No, no, you don't
want to have a wife or a girlfriend.

1515
01:25:28,521 --> 01:25:31,630
You don't want to have sex.
You don't want to like willing,

1516
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:36,350
don't want to engage in like fun
things and really is that too much?

1517
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:39,060
It's too much of an effort to,
is that,

1518
01:25:39,190 --> 01:25:42,170
is it really too much of an effort
to have a relationship or can you,

1519
01:25:42,230 --> 01:25:45,980
can it be managed and you're just a lazy
bitch and you can't figure out how to

1520
01:25:46,190 --> 01:25:48,950
manage your own life and manage your own
relationships in a way that you would

1521
01:25:48,951 --> 01:25:52,430
attract someone who would also have sort
of a harmonious relationship with you.

1522
01:25:52,670 --> 01:25:52,881
You know,

1523
01:25:52,881 --> 01:25:55,790
for some people that's like too much work
to try to get their own shit together

1524
01:25:55,791 --> 01:25:57,910
to attract someone.
So I mean it's like a,

1525
01:25:57,930 --> 01:26:01,580
just a real complicated formula so to say,
oh that's too much work.

1526
01:26:01,581 --> 01:26:05,900
I think you miss out on big part
of what it is to be a human being.

1527
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:09,420
He obviously has compassionate
relationships with people
where he's friends with

1528
01:26:09,421 --> 01:26:12,710
them and he communicates with them.
But to not be exchanging affection,

1529
01:26:12,711 --> 01:26:16,460
in my opinion,
is just this massive misunderstanding of,

1530
01:26:16,461 --> 01:26:21,080
of the the joy of life.
Because sex with someone you love,

1531
01:26:21,081 --> 01:26:24,410
that you're really attracted to you is
one of them that you really attracted to.

1532
01:26:24,411 --> 01:26:28,400
It's one of the most intense physical
experiences and beautiful experiences a

1533
01:26:28,401 --> 01:26:31,770
person can ever have. It really
is. It's an intense, it's,

1534
01:26:31,850 --> 01:26:35,780
it's a beautiful intense experience
that cannot be recreated in a solo

1535
01:26:35,781 --> 01:26:36,614
environment.

1536
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:38,640
Well this is that.
This is the thing I like.

1537
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:43,610
It's these are things that are impossible
to answer because that you could,

1538
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:46,490
I only read about them.
I don't know if it's true or not,

1539
01:26:46,850 --> 01:26:51,850
but like I think a lot of people who
become hermits and leave society of those

1540
01:26:51,921 --> 01:26:54,380
people, of all the people who
leave society and become a monk,

1541
01:26:54,970 --> 01:26:59,600
go and become a hermit, go into the woods
and vantage from life, all those people,

1542
01:26:59,870 --> 01:27:03,410
probably a big percentage of them are
doing it as an escape mechanism. Right,

1543
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:04,070
right, right, right.

1544
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:07,730
But I bet there's a small percentage
and then the that are like have heard of

1545
01:27:07,731 --> 01:27:12,731
these peaks that you can climb too and
consciousness that the certain things

1546
01:27:14,151 --> 01:27:17,090
will get in the way of getting to
those peaks. It's not impossible,

1547
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:18,860
but certainly it's kind of like no,
you know,

1548
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:21,170
there's a lot of different paths to do.
The florist,

1549
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:24,470
some of them are more difficult
than others and some of them are,

1550
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:29,810
especially when you've got
the complication of the wife
and children, you can't,

1551
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:32,200
you can't go through some of the,
uh,

1552
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:37,160
forms of discipline that apparently
are required to hit a transcendent

1553
01:27:37,161 --> 01:27:40,790
experience that a lot of
people, many, many, many, many
people have written about.

1554
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:41,541
You know what I mean?

1555
01:27:41,541 --> 01:27:45,170
So I think there is a small group
of people who really authentically,

1556
01:27:45,171 --> 01:27:46,940
you're just like,
I don't want to fucking go for it.

1557
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:52,040
I want to see how far I can go and
do this is their enlightenment,

1558
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:57,250
is there this state of higher awareness
that you can get through meditation?

1559
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:59,450
I want to do that and that,
you know,

1560
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:02,780
the prescription for some of these
things is the fucking meditate for years

1561
01:28:02,781 --> 01:28:05,780
straight. Yeah. You know, you
can't do that with fucking kids.

1562
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:08,300
You can't do that with a,
you can't do that with a job.

1563
01:28:08,301 --> 01:28:11,720
You can't do it with the normal
complications as society.

1564
01:28:11,721 --> 01:28:15,800
So you got to go out into the,
out under the fucking cave to do it.

1565
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,300
Just amazing.
When you really stop and think about it,

1566
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:23,370
it's like no other or rather it's
like any other discipline, you know,

1567
01:28:23,490 --> 01:28:25,890
in order to really take it
to the highest level. Yeah.

1568
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:28,140
You have to devote all of your time to it.
That's it.

1569
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,270
And managing the mind in managing the,

1570
01:28:30,271 --> 01:28:34,770
the deep recesses of your consciousness
and increasing the brain's ability to

1571
01:28:34,771 --> 01:28:36,870
focus on certain tasks and things.

1572
01:28:37,190 --> 01:28:41,940
And then they've shown that
that meditation directly
changes the way the brain

1573
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:46,770
works. Do you know it's the,
the, the, the, the, the rose.

1574
01:28:46,771 --> 01:28:49,600
Um, uh, what would it would,
it would, vision isn't with,

1575
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:53,080
they use when they're doing like cross
sections of the brain during any sort of

1576
01:28:53,081 --> 01:28:57,180
a neural activity, cat scans, I don't
know if it's a cat scan or whatever it is.

1577
01:28:57,181 --> 01:29:00,900
They run tests on people and they find
out like what areas of the brain are.

1578
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,070
Secondly,
they have

1579
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:06,030
remarkable minds. You know, people
that meditate like Buddhist monks,

1580
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:09,490
it's like they've literally
developed a different sort of things

1581
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:12,710
brain dude, it's, I don't think
my brain is changed, but my,

1582
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:15,710
one of my favorite parts of the day,
I wake up in the morning and chant,

1583
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:17,840
I fucking love it dude.
And I'll tell you,

1584
01:29:17,841 --> 01:29:22,841
I'll wake up with my brain's squirming
with shit thoughts and like anxious

1585
01:29:22,941 --> 01:29:26,780
sometimes and just maybe I had a bad
dream or like I'm stressed out about

1586
01:29:26,781 --> 01:29:30,950
something, right? I sit down and fucking
meditate. 10 minutes, 15 minutes later,

1587
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:34,310
it's not gone. Yeah, I'm not healed.
I'm not cured if the thoughts,

1588
01:29:34,311 --> 01:29:38,970
but now the thoughts aren't on top
there underneath my will. Right.

1589
01:29:38,990 --> 01:29:39,471
You know what I mean?

1590
01:29:39,471 --> 01:29:43,070
And that changes everything for the
rest of the day because now when I'm

1591
01:29:43,310 --> 01:29:46,250
attacking the different problems
and things I have to accomplish,

1592
01:29:46,550 --> 01:29:50,510
the first thing I'm feeling is this sense
of self control and underneath it are

1593
01:29:50,511 --> 01:29:55,310
all the anxieties instead of approaching
your problems with an anxious mind or a

1594
01:29:55,311 --> 01:29:56,150
turbulent mine.

1595
01:29:56,270 --> 01:30:00,020
I think managing the mind and
putting the mind to good use,

1596
01:30:00,021 --> 01:30:02,900
it's just like managing the body
and putting the body to good use.

1597
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:05,330
And I think the mind can
become more athletic.

1598
01:30:05,331 --> 01:30:09,320
The mind can become more synaptic or
more responsive rather synaptic weight.

1599
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:14,280
Well the, it's uh, yeah, the mind is
definitely, I'm sure. I mean look,

1600
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:15,890
when you write,
when you write,

1601
01:30:15,891 --> 01:30:18,350
don't you notice that if you like
take time off and write again,

1602
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:22,550
you start writing and you'll feel a little
clunky at first and then after a day

1603
01:30:22,551 --> 01:30:26,360
or two and the groove and then,
yeah. And then you get to that,

1604
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:30,440
it's like you have to like
keep up that sort of shape.

1605
01:30:30,650 --> 01:30:34,970
You have to keep up a certain
creative shape or you know,
or a mine, uh, you know,

1606
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:39,580
a meditative, sort of a controlled
shape. This is what people, yeah.

1607
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:40,940
Um,
this is the product.

1608
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:44,010
This is why more people don't meditate
and more people fucking boring.

1609
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:48,950
It's boring at first. It's boring
at first, but when, but after you

1610
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:53,240
lose your mind after you lose your mind,
after you fucking get past

1611
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:55,980
the initial thing, the
initial, like boredom of it,

1612
01:30:55,981 --> 01:30:58,090
it turns into something really incredible.
Yeah.

1613
01:30:58,230 --> 01:30:59,660
But he's the deepest you've ever gotten

1614
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:04,250
through meditation. Yeah. Man,

1615
01:31:04,251 --> 01:31:08,540
the deepest I ever got through
meditation was I was super stoned.

1616
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:13,070
That does not count. Oh, it's
the wound is here. Right?

1617
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:24,290
Most certainly you can get stolen shit,
man.

1618
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:25,400
Yeah.
You get you.

1619
01:31:25,401 --> 01:31:28,550
It's one of my favorite things to do
as it get stoned and meditate. Fuck,

1620
01:31:28,551 --> 01:31:31,760
that's the best man.
We kinda had this funny story about,

1621
01:31:31,940 --> 01:31:36,680
or this funny analogy about Ufo abductees
is that the real problem with any

1622
01:31:36,681 --> 01:31:39,200
stories about that you
ever hear about Ufo is,

1623
01:31:39,201 --> 01:31:43,310
is that you have to automatically discount
every one of them that involve five

1624
01:31:43,311 --> 01:31:47,950
grams of mushrooms. Well, it's
true too, right? Because you, oh,

1625
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:51,890
you were tripping dude,
but made me, that's no, but
maybe that's how he sees it.

1626
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:53,300
Yeah. Well no, fuck

1627
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:54,700
or maybe like a lot,

1628
01:31:54,701 --> 01:31:58,420
a lot of different philosophies came
from people getting really high.

1629
01:31:58,421 --> 01:32:02,440
That's that book I showed you.
You know that cannabis is, has,

1630
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:07,450
it is a very old plant that we've had
a relationship with for a long time and

1631
01:32:07,511 --> 01:32:11,530
people love doing validate things that
you thought of when you were stoned.

1632
01:32:11,531 --> 01:32:15,700
They lost and validate
states of consciousness you
attain through merging with a

1633
01:32:15,701 --> 01:32:20,570
plant mother. But I'll tell you, man,
fucking getting hot chanting and,

1634
01:32:20,571 --> 01:32:23,860
and uh, getting high. Wow.

1635
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:27,460
That's like now if you want me to
like come up with a time when I,

1636
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:28,960
when I wasn't stoned in meditating.

1637
01:32:28,961 --> 01:32:32,890
I do think of a time when I was on the
zen retreats sitting and staring at a

1638
01:32:32,891 --> 01:32:36,040
wall and for like seven hours straight.

1639
01:32:36,041 --> 01:32:39,670
And like definitely there was a shift
in consciousness and I was like getting,

1640
01:32:40,660 --> 01:32:44,260
getting confused. I take,
I take offense to that.

1641
01:32:45,070 --> 01:32:46,030
I really do.

1642
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:50,050
I was getting confused because I've
been staring at a wall for so long.

1643
01:32:50,051 --> 01:32:54,910
I was getting confused about my identity,
which was sort of a consciousness.

1644
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:59,990
Yeah. It was a bit of a
poisoning, but she like,

1645
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,970
well, I was staring at the
wall and I knew I was, I mean,

1646
01:33:03,980 --> 01:33:08,870
we're talking like eight hours and
fucking meditating. Malik's yeah.

1647
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:12,040
With your eyes open, like you're just
kind of going in and out of like,

1648
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:16,030
no,
you technically you're not supposed to be.

1649
01:33:16,031 --> 01:33:20,860
This is why in the Zen temples in
Japan where the people really take it

1650
01:33:20,861 --> 01:33:21,311
seriously,

1651
01:33:21,311 --> 01:33:26,020
people walk around with fucking rods and
the moment amongst starts nodding off.

1652
01:33:26,021 --> 01:33:30,840
They get a nice fucking rod and the
right on their shoulder, you can whack,

1653
01:33:31,090 --> 01:33:35,400
wake your ass up. Wow. So like, um,

1654
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:36,950
and that's no,

1655
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:41,370
they want you there in the moment and
you're trying to accomplish, well,

1656
01:33:43,210 --> 01:33:45,550
super,
she mentioned

1657
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:50,380
the only way to become like
a real warrior. It could
become a psychic warrior.

1658
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:52,660
Well, this is the fucking
crazy thing man. I mean with,

1659
01:33:52,661 --> 01:33:57,490
with what's a zen monk trying to
accomplish the answer to that? Nothing.

1660
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:01,500
It's like a but, but um, yeah,

1661
01:34:01,810 --> 01:34:06,610
but other people who don't have such
lofty ideals to merge with the nothing is

1662
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:09,670
uh, these people are trying
to accomplish things.

1663
01:34:09,671 --> 01:34:13,960
And I believe the name of these super
powers or magical traits that you get from

1664
01:34:13,961 --> 01:34:18,130
disciplining the will are called
cities as I d, d, h. I. S.

1665
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:23,420
Yeah. And these are like, these are
like the ability, if you, if you,

1666
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:27,100
if you start focusing, you know, I
would even say that in some weird way,

1667
01:34:27,270 --> 01:34:30,880
stand up comedy is a form of city in the
sense that you're able to get in front

1668
01:34:30,881 --> 01:34:33,980
of a group of people and
make them fucking laugh. Uh,

1669
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:35,830
and it takes a long time to develop.

1670
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:39,750
It's a discipline that takes a long
time to develop. And you get this skill,

1671
01:34:39,780 --> 01:34:43,720
it's kind of abnormal that some people
aren't able to do. You know what I mean?

1672
01:34:43,721 --> 01:34:45,970
Like it doesn't have to
be reading someone's mind.

1673
01:34:45,971 --> 01:34:49,060
It doesn't have to be levitating or
walking through a wall. It's just like,

1674
01:34:49,270 --> 01:34:52,410
shit man. When I watch the fucking
UFC and see somebody do it,

1675
01:34:52,411 --> 01:34:56,020
flying leg kick and to someone's
head, that's magic. To me,

1676
01:34:56,021 --> 01:35:00,020
that's a magical fucking thing. That
guy, the fact that that guy can do that,

1677
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:03,380
it's acrobatic or when
they're these fucking asshole,

1678
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:04,520
not they're not really assholes,

1679
01:35:04,521 --> 01:35:06,740
but when you see him getting
our backflip content,

1680
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:09,710
these guys throw a fucking
back flip like it's nothing.

1681
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:15,640
We're fighting for three rounds and
handed the backflip doesn't land and you

1682
01:35:16,311 --> 01:35:16,880
fall.

1683
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:21,020
That's going to be played on the internet
or at least get involved in that back

1684
01:35:21,021 --> 01:35:25,050
flip. It's super extreme man.
So to me that's also a four.

1685
01:35:25,070 --> 01:35:28,770
It's not real magic in this instance.
Explain, explain, explain it.

1686
01:35:28,940 --> 01:35:33,940
But it's like I think that people have
can develop other forms of this and the

1687
01:35:35,451 --> 01:35:38,570
other forms of it.
I don't want to use the term telepathy,

1688
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:42,980
but maybe people get really
good at reading micro
gestures or micro movements in

1689
01:35:42,981 --> 01:35:46,100
someone's face and recognizing when
they're telling the truth or when they're

1690
01:35:46,101 --> 01:35:47,840
telling a lot,
fuck man.

1691
01:35:47,990 --> 01:35:52,010
Just someone who's really focused and
sitting and listening to you and looking

1692
01:35:52,011 --> 01:35:54,980
you in the eye and a really
focused way that's a nerving.

1693
01:35:54,981 --> 01:35:59,420
Sometimes when someone's got real
fucking focus, cause most people don't.

1694
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:03,530
Most people are scattered. They're
scattered to the fucking wins. Man.

1695
01:36:03,770 --> 01:36:07,220
Barely listened to you for four minutes
without fading out or checking their

1696
01:36:07,221 --> 01:36:09,080
phone or fucking,
you know what I mean?

1697
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:14,150
So we'll itself just the ability to draw
your senses and in focus in the moment,

1698
01:36:14,390 --> 01:36:17,270
that's a pretty potent
thing to be able to to do.

1699
01:36:17,330 --> 01:36:20,780
And you're not going to get
that from playing video games.

1700
01:36:20,870 --> 01:36:23,270
You're going to get that from
getting drunk all the time.

1701
01:36:23,271 --> 01:36:25,520
You're not going to get that
from fucking all the time.

1702
01:36:25,521 --> 01:36:30,320
You're going to get that from
stopping the show, sitting down,

1703
01:36:30,740 --> 01:36:32,270
crossing your legs,

1704
01:36:32,570 --> 01:36:37,570
taking a breath and not moving for 10
minutes and watch your mind freak the fuck

1705
01:36:37,911 --> 01:36:42,250
out. Your mind will turn into a cat.
You're trying to put in the bathtub.

1706
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:46,130
Your mind will just start
wriggling squirming, warming.
Hey, what are you doing?

1707
01:36:46,430 --> 01:36:47,930
That's almost the first thing
he's thinking like, come on.

1708
01:36:47,931 --> 01:36:50,480
What are you fucking doing here? What
are you sitting here not moving forward?

1709
01:36:50,481 --> 01:36:53,000
What is this or you think you are?
Thank you fucking Gandhi.

1710
01:36:53,210 --> 01:36:55,280
What do you think you're doing? Really?
You're gonna do this. And then that.

1711
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,330
If you overcome that,

1712
01:36:56,331 --> 01:36:59,510
then that'll change a little bit and
all of a sudden you'll start relaxing a

1713
01:36:59,511 --> 01:37:02,840
little bit. Your body relax and all
of a sudden it's like, Oh shit man,

1714
01:37:02,841 --> 01:37:04,520
I haven't put that fucking
candle out in the other room.

1715
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:07,520
I should go put that candle on the other
and I think I left a candle burning in

1716
01:37:07,521 --> 01:37:10,340
the other room. And then you just breathe
through that and then it's going to be,

1717
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:13,160
oh fuck. I called Jack, I forgot
to call Jack. It's all these,

1718
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:15,760
these moments trying to take you away.

1719
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:19,880
It's almost like your mind is set all
these infinite traps to keep you from

1720
01:37:19,881 --> 01:37:23,300
getting in the state of stillness,
but eventually the more you do that,

1721
01:37:23,450 --> 01:37:27,080
the more your mind will begin to be
in the moment and not be in a place of

1722
01:37:27,081 --> 01:37:30,890
expectation and not be waiting for the
meditation doing and not be thinking

1723
01:37:30,891 --> 01:37:33,560
about how cool it is that you're
meditating or out dominoes that you're

1724
01:37:33,561 --> 01:37:38,210
meditating. Something else kicks in
that thing, that fucking thing, man.

1725
01:37:38,211 --> 01:37:42,230
That's the thing that I think people are
trying to extend through their entire

1726
01:37:42,231 --> 01:37:42,861
lifetime.

1727
01:37:42,861 --> 01:37:47,690
It's just that state of being present
in the moment with no goal for what's

1728
01:37:47,691 --> 01:37:50,860
going to happen, not caring
about what happened. You know? I,

1729
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:54,920
it's just a difficult place to get to.
You don't always want to be there either.

1730
01:37:55,380 --> 01:37:56,010
You don't want to be there

1731
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:59,180
all day because you have to live with
humans and if you're going to live

1732
01:37:59,250 --> 01:38:02,310
completely in that total zen state,
I guess he could do it.

1733
01:38:02,311 --> 01:38:05,970
Ron doss style and just go video
conferencing with people all day online.

1734
01:38:06,150 --> 01:38:07,590
But if you want to actually
try and make a living,

1735
01:38:07,650 --> 01:38:08,520
no,
the ROM dot.

1736
01:38:08,521 --> 01:38:12,180
Stout is really interesting because
there Ron Bass style doesn't have ethics

1737
01:38:12,181 --> 01:38:15,090
attached to it. Man, that guy
fucking talks about going and eating,

1738
01:38:15,091 --> 01:38:19,920
like going into a fucking restaurant
and ordering a steak. Yeah.

1739
01:38:19,921 --> 01:38:23,640
Fuck yeah. Steak he did in this story.
I don't know if he continues to eat me,

1740
01:38:23,641 --> 01:38:27,430
but it's like his whole thing
is like, listen man, it's
not worth what we're, well,

1741
01:38:27,990 --> 01:38:32,730
what we're going for here isn't fake.
A fake way of fake and position.

1742
01:38:32,731 --> 01:38:37,140
What we're going here, it for us or going
for is this being in the flow of life,

1743
01:38:37,170 --> 01:38:40,310
being in the moment, wedding it. Sometimes
I'm in total fucking cheeseburgers.

1744
01:38:40,311 --> 01:38:44,150
Times eat that Burger. Sometimes
it needs fucking, you know, uh,

1745
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:47,820
get your cock sucked sometimes. You
know what I mean? Sometimes it means,

1746
01:38:48,030 --> 01:38:48,191
well,

1747
01:38:48,191 --> 01:38:53,191
you said that was so southern and your
docs up North Carolina and my sister's

1748
01:38:53,431 --> 01:38:54,264
room,

1749
01:38:56,090 --> 01:39:00,750
I love my southern accent
does come out sometimes, but
yeah, man, it, this is this,

1750
01:39:00,751 --> 01:39:03,970
this state of being in the
moment doesn't mean, right,

1751
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:04,211
right.

1752
01:39:04,211 --> 01:39:08,730
But don't you have some sort of an ethical
responsibility for animal cruelty and

1753
01:39:08,731 --> 01:39:12,950
the pollution of the environment and
all the different variables that really,

1754
01:39:12,980 --> 01:39:16,370
even though you have no control over,
you are a part of society and yeah,

1755
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:19,660
the macro contribute to the
problem by continuing support.

1756
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:22,550
This is what I think about that.
I call this the what you're saying.

1757
01:39:22,551 --> 01:39:24,680
I consider it the starving kid in Africa.

1758
01:39:24,890 --> 01:39:27,380
The starving kids in
Africa has stopped many,

1759
01:39:27,381 --> 01:39:31,640
many people from experimenting with
like bringing their will end the world

1760
01:39:31,641 --> 01:39:34,070
because they think, yeah. What about
the fucking starving kid in Africa?

1761
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:36,290
What about the,
what about the macro?

1762
01:39:36,291 --> 01:39:40,570
What about the eating meat
hurts animals and um, the big,

1763
01:39:40,580 --> 01:39:45,260
the bigger picture where I think that
that is a very valid thing to think about.

1764
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:48,290
But I think the first thing to think
about before you start thinking about the

1765
01:39:48,291 --> 01:39:51,110
bigger picture is your little picture,
right?

1766
01:39:51,111 --> 01:39:54,380
It's thinking about how are you
treating the people around you? How,

1767
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:58,340
what living condition or un,
how are you healthy?

1768
01:39:58,341 --> 01:40:00,950
Are you exercising first?
Deal with that.

1769
01:40:00,951 --> 01:40:04,400
Deal with that and then worry about the
fucking kid in Africa first deal with

1770
01:40:04,401 --> 01:40:08,840
that thing and you'll get your, you know,
your, your, uh, get your focus back.

1771
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:13,520
Come out of autopilot first because
your ego will tell you like, look man,

1772
01:40:13,521 --> 01:40:14,910
we've got to think about the big picture.

1773
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:18,050
The Ego always wants to think about
the big fucking picture. Do you go?

1774
01:40:18,051 --> 01:40:21,820
Holly's wants to think about like,
if the ego is a messianic,

1775
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:24,920
the ego wants to be Jesus.
The Ego wants to heal the world,

1776
01:40:24,921 --> 01:40:28,430
or the ego wants to fucking do
all this crazy shit. Meanwhile,

1777
01:40:28,431 --> 01:40:31,580
you're fucking smoking cigarettes.
Your apartment smells like cat litter.

1778
01:40:31,581 --> 01:40:34,520
Your falls are fucking
festering with crab lice.

1779
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:39,350
You know what I mean? You got to
fucking think about the fucking money.

1780
01:40:39,870 --> 01:40:41,090
You got to think about the moment.

1781
01:40:41,210 --> 01:40:43,370
Yeah. We were talking about
a dude who was screaming,

1782
01:40:43,371 --> 01:40:46,040
yelling about chem trails while
I was smoking cigarettes. Yeah.

1783
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:48,260
It's like what you're doing,

1784
01:40:48,470 --> 01:40:51,320
how's gotta be worse than what
they're doing by spraying you?

1785
01:40:51,430 --> 01:40:54,150
Absolutely, man. That that's
you. This is the beside.

1786
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:58,960
This I think is the recipe
for a true revolution.

1787
01:40:58,990 --> 01:41:03,450
The recipe for a true evolution does not
involve going out into the world trying

1788
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:04,810
to attack these ancient,

1789
01:41:04,811 --> 01:41:08,340
powerful monolithic structures by
throwing Molotov cocktails at them.

1790
01:41:08,530 --> 01:41:13,530
It fucking involves stopping looking
at the way your treating the people

1791
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:18,910
directly around you. How do you treat
waiters? How do you treat people at the,

1792
01:41:18,911 --> 01:41:23,590
at the cash register? How do you
treat people that you have power over?

1793
01:41:23,591 --> 01:41:26,380
Even if the power's illusionary and it's
just a game cause when you're with a

1794
01:41:26,381 --> 01:41:28,870
waiter, you're playing the
game of someone being served.

1795
01:41:28,871 --> 01:41:31,540
They're playing the game of the sir.
You're just fucking people,

1796
01:41:31,810 --> 01:41:34,400
but you start looking,
how am I treating the people around?

1797
01:41:34,401 --> 01:41:37,400
At first you start looking at how am
I treating myself? That's number one.

1798
01:41:38,060 --> 01:41:41,110
Number one, look at yourself. Are
you being authentic to yourself?

1799
01:41:41,111 --> 01:41:42,370
Are you being sweet to yourself?

1800
01:41:42,371 --> 01:41:45,220
Are you taking vitamins or
you being cruel to yourself?

1801
01:41:45,221 --> 01:41:46,480
Are you poisoning yourself?

1802
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:51,310
Are you shoving poison into your body's
first bodies body first deal with that.

1803
01:41:51,730 --> 01:41:54,700
Then once you start feeling
good and healthy again,

1804
01:41:54,850 --> 01:41:56,350
the depression will start wearing off.

1805
01:41:56,351 --> 01:41:58,480
And then you start looking at the way
you're treating people around you.

1806
01:41:58,900 --> 01:42:01,360
Then you start tipping too much. This
is something you've taught me, man.

1807
01:42:01,870 --> 01:42:04,870
I don't want to go all fucking
secret on everybody's ass here.

1808
01:42:05,050 --> 01:42:09,960
But ever since I started tipping too much
fucking more money than I've ever made,

1809
01:42:09,961 --> 01:42:11,500
it's been coming into my life,
dude.

1810
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:15,120
And I feel like there's some
kind of like direct, uh,

1811
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:19,690
correlation between how much you put out
and how much comes back. It's possible.

1812
01:42:19,691 --> 01:42:24,010
It's also possible that just came
in a coincidental time doing.

1813
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:28,840
You started making money and could tip
because had some momentum running. Dude,

1814
01:42:28,841 --> 01:42:31,160
I'll tell you,
I'll tell you one number one customer.

1815
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:34,570
I'll tell you one quality that is,
I always have when I'm broke.

1816
01:42:34,930 --> 01:42:37,720
You know what that fucking
quality is selfishness.

1817
01:42:37,870 --> 01:42:41,110
I always will look at the way I'm acting.
It's always very fucking selfish.

1818
01:42:41,111 --> 01:42:44,920
It's always survival mode and I got to
look out for me. You know what I mean?

1819
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:48,610
This is, there's a fucking verse and
I always quote the fucking Bible.

1820
01:42:48,611 --> 01:42:49,450
I'm not a Christian,

1821
01:42:49,451 --> 01:42:53,500
but there's a verse in the New
Testament that I'd always perplexed me.

1822
01:42:53,501 --> 01:42:58,501
It was something like those who have
will get more and those who have not more

1823
01:42:58,661 --> 01:43:02,620
will be taken away. And the idea
is like this sense of like this,

1824
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:05,770
it doesn't make sense. It doesn't
go with the way we've been taught.

1825
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:10,180
It doesn't make sense that if
you give out more than you have,

1826
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:15,220
you'll get more back. It doesn't
say you just have to be generous,

1827
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:18,860
give more than you have,
more than you have to give more than you

1828
01:43:20,610 --> 01:43:21,443
can trust with

1829
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:30,420
my children. If you just say I'm going
to try a hundred percent and 10%. I know,

1830
01:43:30,421 --> 01:43:35,110
I know. You're right. No, you know what
it is, man. It's like the, the church,

1831
01:43:35,370 --> 01:43:38,530
uh, had this idea and the
idea was typing, right?

1832
01:43:38,531 --> 01:43:41,880
And the idea was give 10% of
your income to the church. Right.

1833
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:45,970
This is so because the church Churchill
deal with like giving the money out.

1834
01:43:46,390 --> 01:43:49,180
Now I think that this is based
on a metaphysical principle.

1835
01:43:49,330 --> 01:43:53,810
I think it's based on a
metaphysical principle, which
is that, uh, if you give out,

1836
01:43:54,050 --> 01:43:56,060
like imagine, I think we may
have talked about this before,

1837
01:43:56,061 --> 01:43:59,560
but imagine if you cut out
10% of your income and,

1838
01:43:59,630 --> 01:44:04,490
and just put it in a pile and made the
decision that that 10% you're going to

1839
01:44:04,491 --> 01:44:06,410
just fucking give to people in need it,

1840
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:08,150
you're just going to
give it to help people.

1841
01:44:08,150 --> 01:44:09,980
You're going to use it
to like help people.

1842
01:44:09,981 --> 01:44:12,860
That's 10% of your income is going
out into the world to help people.

1843
01:44:13,130 --> 01:44:17,480
That would be your favorite money.
That fucking 10% like on a Saturday.

1844
01:44:17,481 --> 01:44:20,030
If you get to go into that
account and be like, fuck man,

1845
01:44:20,031 --> 01:44:22,920
I'm going to buy my
friend Xbox just because,

1846
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:27,680
because that's coming out of
the 10% that's a cool thing.
That's a good idea, man.

1847
01:44:27,681 --> 01:44:28,880
Everybody thinks it's like,
oh,

1848
01:44:28,881 --> 01:44:31,790
I'm going to go give a ham
sandwich to a heroin addict. No,

1849
01:44:32,150 --> 01:44:33,740
go fucking surprise your friends.

1850
01:44:33,741 --> 01:44:37,580
Take them out to fucking take him out to
dinner and then fucking buy dinner when

1851
01:44:37,581 --> 01:44:39,220
they didn't expect it. Take
one of your friends, right.

1852
01:44:39,221 --> 01:44:42,890
It doesn't have a lot of money right now
and do something really cool for them

1853
01:44:42,891 --> 01:44:45,600
when they don't expect it and don't act
like they, oh, you do swag now. I do it.

1854
01:44:45,601 --> 01:44:49,130
I just thought it'd be fun.
That's fun. That's tightening.

1855
01:44:49,220 --> 01:44:52,480
If you ask me instead of letting the
church be in control of it. Yeah.

1856
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:55,500
Well the problem with the, the church is
always going to be like, who are they?

1857
01:44:55,790 --> 01:44:58,440
Let's, this is people, man, they're
not really representing God,

1858
01:44:58,441 --> 01:45:00,930
so he got a good church. You can
work out well, could they? You know,

1859
01:45:01,110 --> 01:45:03,870
there's a lot of churches that do a
lot of great stuff for the community.

1860
01:45:03,871 --> 01:45:05,760
There's a lot of churches
that keep people together.

1861
01:45:05,761 --> 01:45:07,200
There's a lot of people out there,
dude,

1862
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:10,260
they didn't haven't thought
too much about the world.

1863
01:45:10,620 --> 01:45:14,190
They haven't thought too much about the
complexities of the various different

1864
01:45:14,191 --> 01:45:16,350
things that we do
understand about the world.

1865
01:45:16,351 --> 01:45:20,450
Subatomic particles interacting with
each other across the university.

1866
01:45:20,460 --> 01:45:25,170
The exact same time trek communication
through subatomic particles,

1867
01:45:25,350 --> 01:45:29,100
particles that are in both a super
position when they're in a state of both

1868
01:45:29,101 --> 01:45:31,530
standing and moving at the same time.

1869
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:35,730
Is this too much craziness going on
in the world and there's not enough

1870
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:39,930
curiosity and that combination of that
and their culture and whatever the fuck

1871
01:45:39,931 --> 01:45:41,910
their genetic imprint
was, whatever, you know,

1872
01:45:41,911 --> 01:45:46,500
whatever nine volt battery that they
were born with, all of that combined.

1873
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:50,910
Some people need religion, man. Some
people, it's like a super beneficial tool.

1874
01:45:51,090 --> 01:45:53,400
I don't, I don't deny it. Look at the,

1875
01:45:53,401 --> 01:45:55,350
essentially what Christianity
is supposed to be.

1876
01:45:55,351 --> 01:45:59,240
It's supposed to be someone about
being positive, about representing God,

1877
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:02,190
being booed, living life
by God's standards. Well,

1878
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:06,020
if you look at what God's standards are
sort of vaguely and you'd take out of

1879
01:46:06,021 --> 01:46:08,970
this story is about killing
people and he tells you to kill.

1880
01:46:08,990 --> 01:46:13,710
And what happens if you're a gay dude
and Jesus doesn't say any of that,

1881
01:46:13,711 --> 01:46:15,860
but it's in the Bible.
It's supposed to be the,

1882
01:46:15,870 --> 01:46:19,050
if the Bible is supposed to represent
the word of God, if it is reeling,

1883
01:46:19,770 --> 01:46:20,640
well this is the shit.

1884
01:46:20,730 --> 01:46:23,220
Talk to the fucking loon
land disciples saying right,

1885
01:46:23,370 --> 01:46:25,160
you can't just throw up cry.

1886
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:29,700
Sandy got that whole sweet old book.

1887
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:33,130
Ultimately when it comes down to a Chirsto
really depends on who's running the

1888
01:46:33,131 --> 01:46:33,431
church.

1889
01:46:33,431 --> 01:46:37,450
Like the church could be a great asset
to a community and a good place where

1890
01:46:37,451 --> 01:46:41,740
people learn to be good people
or it could be fucking craziness.

1891
01:46:41,980 --> 01:46:46,210
If you wind up in a church where you
know the priests are fucking kids and the

1892
01:46:46,211 --> 01:46:47,320
whole thing is chaos,

1893
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:50,100
I'll tell you, you know what,
I got a lot info from man.

1894
01:46:50,101 --> 01:46:54,780
I got a big download from when I used
to go to a ga paid church with Reverend

1895
01:46:54,781 --> 01:46:59,490
Michael Beckwith. I would fucking go
there and that guy would last positivity.

1896
01:46:59,491 --> 01:47:03,020
You would go there and get, you would walk
out of there feeling so fucking great.

1897
01:47:03,210 --> 01:47:04,990
What is a,
his denomination?

1898
01:47:05,250 --> 01:47:08,430
Uh, he, I don't know the
name of the and denomination,

1899
01:47:08,431 --> 01:47:12,330
but like he there end into
this book called the science
of mind by Ernest Holmes,

1900
01:47:12,331 --> 01:47:17,280
which is like this idea that you create
your own reality by the thoughts that

1901
01:47:17,281 --> 01:47:19,570
you think. And I know
it's a, it's just uh,

1902
01:47:19,890 --> 01:47:24,810
it's that mixed in with all the world
religions make stand with like kind of

1903
01:47:24,811 --> 01:47:26,130
like, I mean, listen man,

1904
01:47:26,131 --> 01:47:31,131
it's a big church and I'm not saying
every moment of the ceremony wasn't

1905
01:47:31,681 --> 01:47:34,890
slightly embarrassing and I'm
not saying they're not people,

1906
01:47:34,891 --> 01:47:39,630
they're dressed in like baggy big baggy
pants and wearing sandals and have

1907
01:47:39,631 --> 01:47:43,170
really gone deep into fruit land.
I'm not saying that that didn't happen,

1908
01:47:43,171 --> 01:47:47,400
but that church man, some of the
information I got out of there,

1909
01:47:47,690 --> 01:47:50,190
it was fucking really
high tech information.

1910
01:47:50,191 --> 01:47:52,610
I'll tell you something else that happened
to me there and I'm sure I'm going to

1911
01:47:52,611 --> 01:47:56,790
get fucking made fun of for this, but I'll
tell you, man, I had a fucking terrible,

1912
01:47:56,791 --> 01:47:58,110
I'd throw my back out,

1913
01:47:58,470 --> 01:48:01,980
throw my fucking back out and couldn't
move my fucking neck and I was like

1914
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:05,460
fucked up. And in a lot of
pain and I'm standing there,

1915
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:08,170
oh my God,
there was a song you sing.

1916
01:48:08,171 --> 01:48:11,370
Never seen this song and
this fucking guy behind me

1917
01:48:11,870 --> 01:48:14,460
retard giving you a back
rub and grabbing your shaft.

1918
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:17,480
I know there's a story

1919
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:23,640
before you attack the fucking you
gotta let me finish it early in the me.

1920
01:48:24,050 --> 01:48:28,210
Here's the reason I knew
this was coming. I know.

1921
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:30,690
Sorry,
I fucking

1922
01:48:31,230 --> 01:48:31,681
this guy.

1923
01:48:31,681 --> 01:48:36,530
I think it's funny if this
guy touches my back and dude,

1924
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:40,110
instantly I felt fucking better.
Instantly. Everything went away.

1925
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:41,400
My back felt better.
Everything

1926
01:48:41,740 --> 01:48:46,000
you gentlemen remember
what I said yesterday about
disinformation agents? Dunkin,

1927
01:48:46,001 --> 01:48:50,940
clearly we just expose himself as a
government agent agent if disinfection.

1928
01:48:51,190 --> 01:48:54,970
He says all this brilliant shit and
then he incorporates some vacuum magic

1929
01:48:54,971 --> 01:48:59,110
touches because motherfuckers
doing Christian heels

1930
01:48:59,710 --> 01:49:02,170
only report from my own experience.

1931
01:49:02,330 --> 01:49:03,830
What about praying the gay away?

1932
01:49:03,831 --> 01:49:05,990
Have you ever seen anybody
successfully pray the gay away

1933
01:49:07,810 --> 01:49:12,230
now? Have you ever seen
someone try? No. No. Okay.

1934
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:15,190
I haven't seen anyone fucking pray.

1935
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:18,400
Hey Lane,
but it's not the same thing.

1936
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:20,700
It's all the same thing as a guy coming
up and touching you and hearing your

1937
01:49:20,701 --> 01:49:22,730
back didn't come up with

1938
01:49:24,940 --> 01:49:27,240
some magical touch.
He'll get back.

1939
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:34,740
Silly Bitch, why didn't you give
me this? I can't. I can't tell.

1940
01:49:34,750 --> 01:49:36,390
Leave this alone.
This is ridiculous.

1941
01:49:36,660 --> 01:49:40,890
So some guy came up and like that'd be
his desire to stick his penis inside.

1942
01:49:40,891 --> 01:49:44,610
Your asshole was so strong,
but as he touched your back to jolt,

1943
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:47,920
just realign your back because your back
knew that it had to fight to survive

1944
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:52,370
because they're all felt the love and
lust of this man's fingertips. Sterile.

1945
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:53,333
You'll me

1946
01:49:56,230 --> 01:50:01,220
Dale have flannel underwear on. He wasn't
wearing underwear that, whoa, look,

1947
01:50:01,290 --> 01:50:05,950
I bill I, I'm s rock Cockins
zipper. I'm dangerous.

1948
01:50:06,290 --> 01:50:09,150
Right? Pressed up against the
cold metal resemble. Yeah.

1949
01:50:09,180 --> 01:50:12,280
I believe that your
attorney healers and always

1950
01:50:13,990 --> 01:50:15,010
let me just touch his back.

1951
01:50:16,150 --> 01:50:19,330
The gay came out of his hand like a
lightening bolt and was like one of the

1952
01:50:19,331 --> 01:50:21,990
Avengers.
The gay came out of his hand,

1953
01:50:22,020 --> 01:50:25,390
India back and it just popped
your back into order. Hey listen,

1954
01:50:25,391 --> 01:50:29,740
this is exactly what Jesus said was like
a baby. I'm being persecuted. I you,

1955
01:50:29,770 --> 01:50:34,090
you know what you, and this is religious
persecution and yes, it is. Absolutely.

1956
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:37,390
Absolutely. Like I prayed
it, he, he got out, he

1957
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:44,500
couldn't help himself.
You were sexy,

1958
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:48,730
was slightly slumped leaning to one
side liquid, get a hurt knee, navy.

1959
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:50,560
Trying to remember the,
perhaps even limping,

1960
01:50:50,620 --> 01:50:53,990
trying to remember the song that we
sang there just so I get your anymore.

1961
01:50:59,370 --> 01:51:03,230
I think I did. I'm going to give you
more. Okay. More fucking ammo. Okay.

1962
01:51:05,180 --> 01:51:06,013
La,

1963
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:10,280
go read God's power.

1964
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:12,620
Something my life.
I can't wait.

1965
01:51:13,050 --> 01:51:15,870
And they would just sing this over and
over again and everybody was really

1966
01:51:15,871 --> 01:51:16,704
getting into it.

1967
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:20,330
People would like go up and down the
aisles with Kleenex because people would

1968
01:51:20,331 --> 01:51:24,110
start crying and like it was like,
but you know the,

1969
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:28,880
I've learned to not throw the
baby out with the bath water. Uh,

1970
01:51:29,120 --> 01:51:33,050
and so like a lot of the stuff, yeah.
I don't know if I necessarily was like,

1971
01:51:33,410 --> 01:51:37,010
you know, fully on board, but I got
some good information from there, man.

1972
01:51:37,011 --> 01:51:38,950
There was like some really,
uh,

1973
01:51:39,410 --> 01:51:44,410
the shit that he talked about was this
concept of being able to like at your,

1974
01:51:44,661 --> 01:51:49,520
you decide when it's time to, to be
happy. You decided to not be a victim.

1975
01:51:49,521 --> 01:51:52,430
You decided to pull yourself out of the
negative Meyer that you're in and you

1976
01:51:52,431 --> 01:51:55,700
can just do it.
You don't have to come up with excuses.

1977
01:51:55,701 --> 01:51:58,970
You don't have to go to the fucking
mountains and meditate forever.

1978
01:51:58,971 --> 01:52:02,590
You don't have to, you can just
stop being a victim. Right, right.

1979
01:52:02,780 --> 01:52:03,980
And the moment you do that,

1980
01:52:04,100 --> 01:52:08,960
your life will become a million times
better and everything else will follow

1981
01:52:08,961 --> 01:52:11,570
from there. You know, you'll start
treating people around you better.

1982
01:52:11,780 --> 01:52:13,880
And when you start treating
people around you better,

1983
01:52:13,881 --> 01:52:17,570
you're going to get more
prosperity because if you're
treating people around you

1984
01:52:17,571 --> 01:52:22,000
like, Shit, yeah, you're cutting off
all these currents and circuits that

1985
01:52:22,190 --> 01:52:22,940
well,
you,

1986
01:52:22,940 --> 01:52:25,640
any interaction that you have with
someone that ends up in a negative and

1987
01:52:25,641 --> 01:52:28,340
negative on their side or a
negative on your side, you know,

1988
01:52:28,370 --> 01:52:31,640
it's going to leave you with like a little
bit of a deficit for sure. You know,

1989
01:52:31,730 --> 01:52:35,120
it's not a good feeling. So a good
feeling when someone's upset at, you know,

1990
01:52:35,121 --> 01:52:37,290
it sucks,
sucks fucking sucks.

1991
01:52:37,580 --> 01:52:40,880
And you don't realize how
much of an impact your,

1992
01:52:40,881 --> 01:52:45,650
your words or your actions can really
have until you see them someone,

1993
01:52:45,651 --> 01:52:48,140
and then you realize then it's
all manifest itself to you.

1994
01:52:48,141 --> 01:52:51,710
It all shows and you're like, God
damn it. What the fuck was I thinking?

1995
01:52:51,711 --> 01:52:54,110
I just got so flippant. Yeah. You know,

1996
01:52:54,111 --> 01:52:59,111
being rude or being aggressive or being
adamant or argumentative or whatever it

1997
01:53:00,591 --> 01:53:03,350
is that causes these blips in the matrix.

1998
01:53:03,530 --> 01:53:06,260
But sometimes you need to have those
in your life. Just as a reminder,

1999
01:53:06,370 --> 01:53:09,410
you know me, careful, you know, not even
saying that you should have to have them,

2000
01:53:09,590 --> 01:53:13,320
but you look, I, I've seen, I seen him
in other people and I learned, well, it's

2001
01:53:13,550 --> 01:53:16,520
ping pong, man. You can get
caught up in a long game and shit.

2002
01:53:16,521 --> 01:53:20,960
Ping Pong young people and it's like,
look, there's no way that you're going to,

2003
01:53:21,380 --> 01:53:25,480
there's no way that you're going to be
perfect and there's no way you're going

2004
01:53:25,481 --> 01:53:30,481
to avoid conflict and there's no way
you're going to avoid getting angry.

2005
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:33,890
But the main thing is,
man, here's the main thing,

2006
01:53:34,220 --> 01:53:38,750
forgiveness and forgiveness.
If fucking isn't always fair.

2007
01:53:39,110 --> 01:53:42,800
That's the thing about forgiveness, dude.
It's not always fair. You're not out. He,

2008
01:53:42,801 --> 01:53:46,010
it's not always about who wins or who
loses or who's right or who's wrong.

2009
01:53:46,190 --> 01:53:47,900
Sometimes you just have to be like,
look man,

2010
01:53:48,260 --> 01:53:52,820
we got fucking blasted out of a
pussy or plunging towards oblivion.

2011
01:53:53,270 --> 01:53:57,410
We're in this insane fucking dimension.
You freaked out for a second.

2012
01:53:57,590 --> 01:54:01,940
I freaked out. I forgive you. You
win if you, you know what I mean?

2013
01:54:01,941 --> 01:54:05,750
Like you just take that extra
step and you know what that does?

2014
01:54:05,930 --> 01:54:09,300
That stops the fucking, uh, what,

2015
01:54:09,390 --> 01:54:13,940
when you see like that stops the, the
negative energy ball. That's the idea,

2016
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:17,870
right? Um, are you talking
about anyone in specific?

2017
01:54:18,390 --> 01:54:23,150
Yeah. Yeah. You know, I,

2018
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:23,830
I already,

2019
01:54:23,830 --> 01:54:28,830
I know you already did with for people
to know Brian and Duncan had gotten into

2020
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:33,640
an argument and uh, you
know, it was unfortunate.

2021
01:54:34,380 --> 01:54:38,380
It's unfortunate on both sides as
unfortunate that Dunkin brought it up in a

2022
01:54:38,381 --> 01:54:41,530
public setting and sort of blind side.
And I'm going to think you feel that,

2023
01:54:41,531 --> 01:54:42,150
right?

2024
01:54:42,150 --> 01:54:45,650
I set it on that last pass.
Yeah. Did I did the real,

2025
01:54:45,690 --> 01:54:48,230
here's the real thing I learned from
it though, man. This is the thing, you,

2026
01:54:48,250 --> 01:54:53,130
you're not going to avoid conflict.
And in a community,

2027
01:54:53,370 --> 01:54:55,520
that's one thing I learned is we
have this little fucking commodity.

2028
01:54:55,600 --> 01:54:57,550
Do you,
if you had a chance to do it all again,

2029
01:54:57,551 --> 01:55:00,630
you wouldn't have done it that
way. Absolutely not. Yeah.

2030
01:55:01,330 --> 01:55:03,730
I'm going to be honest with you.
And Maura was snippy that day anyway,

2031
01:55:03,731 --> 01:55:07,420
my name even got snippy with me when I
was fucking with you and I was not being

2032
01:55:07,421 --> 01:55:10,570
not aggressive, but you, you seem
like you a bit testy that day.

2033
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:14,910
Yeah, man. I was texting you that
day and, and what happened was, um,

2034
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:16,193
without going into,

2035
01:55:16,260 --> 01:55:21,170
I hate fucking resurrecting it again
because I think that it's like, um,

2036
01:55:21,240 --> 01:55:24,260
what made you test you that day?
I don't want to talk about that man.

2037
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:27,210
Okay. And that's a personal issue.
It's a fucking personal issue.

2038
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:31,830
You certainly have, there's a
family issue or a bit imbalanced.

2039
01:55:32,470 --> 01:55:35,310
Yeah. But anyway, there's no excuse. I
don't fucking know why was I testing,

2040
01:55:35,340 --> 01:55:38,230
always test me cause I was not
in control of my fucking self.

2041
01:55:38,231 --> 01:55:40,280
That's when anyone's testing,
there's no excuse. Right.

2042
01:55:40,281 --> 01:55:43,410
People always come up with excuses for
acting like a fucking asshole. Right.

2043
01:55:43,411 --> 01:55:44,740
It all boils down to like

2044
01:55:44,870 --> 01:55:48,220
you handling your own shit. Yeah. Not
imposing your own bullshit on. Yeah,

2045
01:55:48,300 --> 01:55:52,860
exactly. Do it. But, so
the what, what happened is,

2046
01:55:53,130 --> 01:55:53,963
um,

2047
01:55:54,300 --> 01:55:58,860
so what happened is during a podcast
and Atlanta with Marshall Child's the

2048
01:55:58,861 --> 01:56:02,930
laughing skull, I was
starting to talk about, uh,

2049
01:56:03,030 --> 01:56:06,210
it was videos I made for
south by southwest because
I was trying to lead in to

2050
01:56:06,211 --> 01:56:07,960
talking about the
Moontower comedy festival.

2051
01:56:08,070 --> 01:56:09,620
Well when people don't know,

2052
01:56:09,621 --> 01:56:14,360
Dunkin has been pretty adamant about the,
uh,

2053
01:56:14,450 --> 01:56:15,440
in my opinion,

2054
01:56:15,560 --> 01:56:19,790
the very correct idea that if you're
going to have a festival when you profit

2055
01:56:19,791 --> 01:56:23,210
off of it and you have comedians
perform at your festival,

2056
01:56:23,660 --> 01:56:26,570
at the very least you
have to fly down there.

2057
01:56:26,571 --> 01:56:28,490
I mean if you want them to work for free,

2058
01:56:28,491 --> 01:56:31,520
you can't really expect
them to fly themselves.

2059
01:56:31,540 --> 01:56:34,100
And then when you find out the whole
thing was sponsored by an airline,

2060
01:56:34,101 --> 01:56:35,240
you're like, what? Right.

2061
01:56:35,730 --> 01:56:38,150
Cause they are going to profit by
the fact that people have to fly in.

2062
01:56:38,170 --> 01:56:41,390
Like the whole thing is
crazy. So you, you wrote this,

2063
01:56:41,420 --> 01:56:46,250
you made this video where it was Hitler
and then over Hitler's screaming you had

2064
01:56:46,310 --> 01:56:50,630
the handle translation. The Hitler
meme. Yes. The translation was saying,

2065
01:56:50,631 --> 01:56:52,460
you know how preposterous it is,
right.

2066
01:56:52,610 --> 01:56:57,260
It was just the basic idea. What
you said, if you charge for a,

2067
01:56:57,380 --> 01:57:01,390
if you have an event centered
around Comedians, artists, whatever,

2068
01:57:01,750 --> 01:57:04,150
that couldn't function without
the comedians or artists,

2069
01:57:04,450 --> 01:57:06,580
you have to fairly compensate them.
You have to pay them,

2070
01:57:06,581 --> 01:57:08,680
pay them a percentage of the door.
It doesn't have to be a lack,

2071
01:57:08,681 --> 01:57:11,890
give them a little cut, whether
it's a flight hotel, I don't know.

2072
01:57:11,891 --> 01:57:14,290
Whatever the fuck it is.
Right. Just like make it fair.

2073
01:57:14,590 --> 01:57:19,590
So I was starting to talk about that
and then Brian got on the microphone and

2074
01:57:21,521 --> 01:57:25,930
started talking about how no, no, no, they
pay the performers. Whereas like I have,

2075
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:29,050
you know, I said it was up to
the venues. Well No, no he, he,

2076
01:57:29,051 --> 01:57:32,020
what he was talking
about was as a comedian,

2077
01:57:32,110 --> 01:57:37,090
you can get sponsorship from other
people like Brown paper tickets or other,

2078
01:57:37,091 --> 01:57:41,590
like corporations will pay for you to
perform at their parties or will in some

2079
01:57:41,591 --> 01:57:44,470
way fund you.
But the festival itself doesn't pay.

2080
01:57:44,780 --> 01:57:47,000
So some venues don't pay.
The artists know.

2081
01:57:47,070 --> 01:57:50,690
Some venues don't decide that because
they're at a certain place in your paid.

2082
01:57:51,050 --> 01:57:51,201
Cause.

2083
01:57:51,201 --> 01:57:55,190
I've heard that some people have gotten
paid by south by southwest who's getting

2084
01:57:55,191 --> 01:57:55,630
paid.

2085
01:57:55,630 --> 01:57:56,900
I have,
um,

2086
01:57:57,040 --> 01:58:01,570
I actually think the Guy Charlie said
tello who runs south by southwest.

2087
01:58:01,571 --> 01:58:06,520
When I was at Moontower, we had the same
fucking conversation. Right. And you know,

2088
01:58:06,521 --> 01:58:10,240
like you, he was, he was saying, you
know, we don't, we don't fucking pay job.

2089
01:58:10,241 --> 01:58:13,450
We didn't pay Johnny Cash. Whoa. You know
what I mean? Like we don't pay. Yeah,

2090
01:58:13,451 --> 01:58:17,370
I know. Watch, you know, like
gangster, he was saying, yeah,

2091
01:58:17,680 --> 01:58:19,680
yeah. Johnny Cash to work
for you for free. Okay,

2092
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:21,370
sir. All right. So that's the point.

2093
01:58:21,371 --> 01:58:24,510
I already had this conversation with
this guy right about this. So I,

2094
01:58:24,511 --> 01:58:28,540
at least from the perspective
of the representative of
south by southwest in the

2095
01:58:28,541 --> 01:58:33,180
comedy side, it told me directly
this happened. And then also as a,

2096
01:58:33,181 --> 01:58:36,920
as an, uh, um, as a, uh, uh,

2097
01:58:38,450 --> 01:58:42,100
other note, he said, you know, we,
we do give a hundred bucks. Well,

2098
01:58:42,101 --> 01:58:45,400
we don't even talk about it.
So they pay comics 100 bucks.

2099
01:58:45,580 --> 01:58:48,400
That's what I found out. That we don't
talk about it. Yeah. That's what he said.

2100
01:58:48,430 --> 01:58:51,040
He said, this is not going to, I
didn't bring up Charlie's to tell them,

2101
01:58:52,060 --> 01:58:55,910
by the way, when there's a big secret, we
were given a comic, a hundred bucks. Yeah.

2102
01:58:55,911 --> 01:58:58,510
Whatever. It's still so the, so, um,

2103
01:58:58,580 --> 01:59:01,540
and Charlotte to tell it seemed like a
really nice guy and I kind of respect him

2104
01:59:01,541 --> 01:59:03,130
for coming up to me and
talking to me about it.

2105
01:59:03,130 --> 01:59:04,600
I still completely disagree with him,

2106
01:59:04,900 --> 01:59:07,820
but he came up and he talks
because he heard your video. Yeah.

2107
01:59:07,950 --> 01:59:11,050
He's the one who does the comics
or south by southwest. So like,

2108
01:59:11,530 --> 01:59:13,210
it was really cool.
He wasn't angry.

2109
01:59:13,570 --> 01:59:16,750
He just came up to me and broke it down
in his own way from his own paradigm

2110
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:20,860
about fucking work. So anyway,
justification for not paying.

2111
01:59:20,980 --> 01:59:24,380
You get a lot out of the festival
as a performer. It's, it's,

2112
01:59:24,400 --> 01:59:28,230
there's two paradigms. The paradigms
are, the two paradigms are, uh,

2113
01:59:29,050 --> 01:59:33,280
people who pay based on a percentage
from the door or some other form of like

2114
01:59:33,281 --> 01:59:37,090
money compensation and people who feel
like they're offering a venue and they're

2115
01:59:37,091 --> 01:59:41,020
offering the benefits that you
get from performing on a show,

2116
01:59:41,060 --> 01:59:44,810
whether it's working out or HR were
amazing. The idea that, you know,

2117
01:59:44,830 --> 01:59:49,830
you could have a festival of art and the
a profitable festival art and say that

2118
01:59:52,001 --> 01:59:55,450
the festival is more important that
the art that's represented there.

2119
01:59:55,450 --> 01:59:57,070
So the festival should profit.

2120
01:59:57,370 --> 02:00:02,370
But the artists are getting the luxury
of performing pimp gangster festival and

2121
02:00:04,181 --> 02:00:08,350
a lot of it's really amazing.
I like to play my own devil's advocate.

2122
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:12,430
South by southwest is an expensive
festival and a lot of people like seeing

2123
02:00:12,431 --> 02:00:15,760
bands and some comics like seeing
bands and we're going to go to south by

2124
02:00:15,761 --> 02:00:20,060
southwest anyway, so now they don't have
to pay the 700 bucks that you have paid.

2125
02:00:20,061 --> 02:00:21,490
They see everything.
So there's that.

2126
02:00:21,910 --> 02:00:26,680
There's the justification of that
perspective. I've never been,

2127
02:00:27,010 --> 02:00:31,990
but regardless I feel, when is it? I
don't know. You know, we should do,

2128
02:00:31,991 --> 02:00:36,970
we should just book the Cap City if
it's not already booked probably.

2129
02:00:37,490 --> 02:00:38,720
I bet it's already booked a,

2130
02:00:38,721 --> 02:00:42,040
but it's like something like Doug Benson
or someone tries to get like even Vance,

2131
02:00:42,130 --> 02:00:44,950
I'd be really fun cause it
doesn't Doug do all that shit.

2132
02:00:44,950 --> 02:00:48,280
He goes to all those places. I
don't know. Yeah, he's always,

2133
02:00:48,510 --> 02:00:51,280
he's a wild bachelor character.

2134
02:00:51,790 --> 02:00:56,620
He's out there slinging Dick around
the country for 20 in the afternoon on

2135
02:00:56,621 --> 02:00:59,860
Saturdays. He's doing what he wants
now, man. It's really fascinating.

2136
02:00:59,861 --> 02:01:01,930
You know he's got,
Doug's got,

2137
02:01:01,980 --> 02:01:06,980
this is this thing where he can
show up at like a regular club,

2138
02:01:07,361 --> 02:01:11,200
like it has a full weekend and he comes
on at four 20 in the afternoon and he

2139
02:01:11,201 --> 02:01:15,400
does these for 20 shows where it's all
his fans. What about side Boob? Sunday.

2140
02:01:15,401 --> 02:01:18,970
How'd that guy manufacturer that where
it gets checks to send pictures of their

2141
02:01:19,180 --> 02:01:23,800
side tit. Who's this? Who are you
talking about? Doug Benson does that.

2142
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:28,330
It's the best side boob.
Sunday. People tweet,

2143
02:01:29,110 --> 02:01:31,680
beautiful hippie chicks tweet.
They're like the profile.

2144
02:01:34,180 --> 02:01:35,050
That's beautiful.
Some,

2145
02:01:35,051 --> 02:01:38,800
it's really funny how you look on Twitter
and some a porn girls have like pick

2146
02:01:38,801 --> 02:01:40,010
of the,
and you

2147
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:40,551
click on it,

2148
02:01:40,551 --> 02:01:43,730
it's done with a giant Dick in their
mouth and one their ass and you're like,

2149
02:01:43,731 --> 02:01:48,170
whoa. Really? Just picking
the day. That's it.

2150
02:01:48,470 --> 02:01:51,170
No fucking morning at all.
Like you got to go, okay,

2151
02:01:51,171 --> 02:01:52,730
well now I know how she's walking in.

2152
02:01:52,890 --> 02:01:55,520
There's some girls don't ever
have that in their Twitter. Some,

2153
02:01:55,610 --> 02:01:58,340
some strippers might
as well be accountants.

2154
02:01:58,341 --> 02:02:01,580
They might as well be working for Denny's,
you know, they just have like, you know,

2155
02:02:01,581 --> 02:02:05,600
here's today, this is what I
did. I built Dah, Dah, Dah.
But some, uh, some of those,

2156
02:02:05,601 --> 02:02:09,560
uh, porn girls have, they'll
just throw up some wild pictures.

2157
02:02:09,680 --> 02:02:13,830
You've gotta be NSFW gotta be careful that

2158
02:02:15,590 --> 02:02:19,100
when people get mad for probably,
well,

2159
02:02:19,650 --> 02:02:23,790
does that work thing? That's what
we were talking about earlier. Well,

2160
02:02:24,150 --> 02:02:27,830
I mean it was sort of, I mean, we
didn't even really dove into it.

2161
02:02:27,910 --> 02:02:32,540
What happened was Lou and this elevated
snippy state, I'll just cut to the chase.

2162
02:02:32,570 --> 02:02:35,870
You called Brian out for something
that you believe that he was doing

2163
02:02:35,871 --> 02:02:39,230
incorrectly with how he was
putting on a comedy show. And uh,

2164
02:02:39,290 --> 02:02:42,440
he defended himself and got very upset
at you and couldn't believe that you set

2165
02:02:42,441 --> 02:02:46,580
it on here. And he was really
hurt and stormed out of the
room. And then, you know,

2166
02:02:46,850 --> 02:02:50,960
we sort of were sat around and talked
about the importance of comedians getting

2167
02:02:50,961 --> 02:02:54,710
paid and whether or not that was the
right thing to do and what the real issue

2168
02:02:54,711 --> 02:02:57,470
is. And you know, it's uh, there's,

2169
02:02:57,500 --> 02:03:01,910
there's a side to be tad on
both men's point of view.

2170
02:03:01,911 --> 02:03:03,770
Brian's and yours,
you know,

2171
02:03:03,800 --> 02:03:07,480
there's a side to be had on Brian's
about the way you presented it, did it,

2172
02:03:07,490 --> 02:03:11,420
you did it like when you were in this
elevated state and you were responding to

2173
02:03:11,421 --> 02:03:15,110
him questioning New Year in the south
by southwest thing and you attacked,

2174
02:03:15,150 --> 02:03:19,970
some people don't know this just to
make sure people know I told Marshall

2175
02:03:19,971 --> 02:03:21,880
knocked to upload. Yeah. Okay.

2176
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:27,800
I know you're not trying to just do not
trying to make it more than it already is

2177
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:33,770
and Brian is a very upset
about it and you know,

2178
02:03:33,771 --> 02:03:38,420
his side of it is that he did pay some
people and there's a lot of expenses and

2179
02:03:38,421 --> 02:03:42,140
that he had to pay for taxes and he's
paying for the rent to keep that place

2180
02:03:42,141 --> 02:03:44,270
open. And you know, to be honest,

2181
02:03:44,271 --> 02:03:47,780
he probably to bit off more than he
could chew and he didn't realize how much

2182
02:03:47,790 --> 02:03:52,790
was ree was involved in not just putting
on a podcast where you just being the

2183
02:03:53,301 --> 02:03:56,570
producer of the podcast, but also
running a comedy show at the same time,

2184
02:03:56,571 --> 02:03:59,500
calling people, booking in, having the
community and show up, put them on,

2185
02:03:59,501 --> 02:04:03,410
give her a flyer, trying to get people to
come put tweeting it, making a big deal.

2186
02:04:03,470 --> 02:04:04,970
It,
it's more involved.

2187
02:04:04,970 --> 02:04:08,510
It's not like those guys that like do
comedy juice or something like that.

2188
02:04:08,511 --> 02:04:11,150
There's a lot of work involved in that.
There's mailing lists and there's,

2189
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:11,541
you know,

2190
02:04:11,541 --> 02:04:14,750
I get their milling this all the time and
they're constantly emailing me all the

2191
02:04:14,751 --> 02:04:18,020
time asking me to come and perform. Like
they're, it's a business for these guys.

2192
02:04:18,021 --> 02:04:21,200
They, they, they're trying to, you
know, there's a lot of work behind it.

2193
02:04:21,410 --> 02:04:25,130
I think it got away from him and he's
corrected it and he's corrected it now.

2194
02:04:25,131 --> 02:04:26,840
And because of this confrontation,

2195
02:04:26,841 --> 02:04:30,410
the good that's come out of it is that
the money situation has been taken

2196
02:04:30,411 --> 02:04:33,710
completely out of his hands. So he doesn't
have to worry about that anymore. Yeah.

2197
02:04:33,711 --> 02:04:37,620
Which is cool. And my shows can
still pay for the rent. Yeah.

2198
02:04:37,730 --> 02:04:40,950
Here's what's not cold. And this
is the thing it taught me. Um,

2199
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:45,410
cause I've been seeing
this in the positive thing,
thankfully in my life mostly.

2200
02:04:45,650 --> 02:04:49,850
But what happened was, even though
it didn't get uploaded at the time,

2201
02:04:50,060 --> 02:04:53,390
it could have, Marshall could have been
like, fuck that. I'm not the leading that.

2202
02:04:53,391 --> 02:04:56,030
That's good. That's going to battle.
Get traffic. That's good. Right.

2203
02:04:56,080 --> 02:04:58,370
You could have been an asshole.
I didn't know where I was totally wrong.

2204
02:04:58,610 --> 02:05:01,040
Shouldn't have brought
it up in a public ward.

2205
02:05:01,070 --> 02:05:04,760
I shouldn't have brought up in a public
way. I was totally fucking wrong.

2206
02:05:04,761 --> 02:05:07,070
Even if I felt like Brian,
uh,

2207
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:10,850
confronting me about south by
southwest was wrong. What I did was,

2208
02:05:10,970 --> 02:05:14,510
so if Brian was throwing a
negative energy ball my way,

2209
02:05:14,540 --> 02:05:15,920
I grabbed that negative energy.

2210
02:05:15,921 --> 02:05:20,900
Bob Expanded it and tried to stuff it down
his throat out it. I didn't feel good.

2211
02:05:20,901 --> 02:05:25,850
I was angry. Right, right. And so then
Brian got mad and then the energy ball,

2212
02:05:25,910 --> 02:05:30,440
he explained to exponentially
increase the energy ball by, uh,

2213
02:05:30,500 --> 02:05:33,050
having a blowout and saying,
fucked up, getting Trostle. Okay.

2214
02:05:33,320 --> 02:05:35,150
He doesn't do well when criticized anyway.

2215
02:05:35,180 --> 02:05:37,850
But my criticized like that
in a very confrontational,

2216
02:05:38,210 --> 02:05:42,210
confrontational manner on a podcast. Yeah.
It's very upsetting for him. Right. But,

2217
02:05:42,770 --> 02:05:45,260
you know, he didn't react
to it. So it was a boat.

2218
02:05:45,261 --> 02:05:49,160
It was bad reactions on both
sides. Neither one of you
guys reacted and verbally,

2219
02:05:49,330 --> 02:05:49,550
you know,

2220
02:05:49,550 --> 02:05:53,060
if you wanted to look back at yourself
and how that whole thing went down,

2221
02:05:53,450 --> 02:05:55,510
you know, where you're going back and
forth to each other. Were you okay?

2222
02:05:55,790 --> 02:06:00,740
I didn't go. That's the thing, man. I went
back, I went, I went back at him once. Oh,

2223
02:06:00,840 --> 02:06:03,400
I apologize. On my podcasts
and I guess I'm gonna call it.

2224
02:06:03,660 --> 02:06:04,970
Yeah, we're good. You did.

2225
02:06:04,980 --> 02:06:09,700
The initial words that you used were
very confrontational in Atlanta. Yes.

2226
02:06:09,730 --> 02:06:13,390
Yes. But then how you launched
it off was very, dude, you look,

2227
02:06:13,391 --> 02:06:14,920
use the words ripping off

2228
02:06:15,570 --> 02:06:19,380
Sarah being off. I said, Robin, I
said, Robin, even worse, I said,

2229
02:06:19,640 --> 02:06:23,340
he's robbing comedians and that's the
fucking wrong word, uh, for not paying

2230
02:06:23,460 --> 02:06:26,280
people. And you will go back and you
listen to it. What do you get out of it?

2231
02:06:26,820 --> 02:06:27,653
Have you listened to it?

2232
02:06:27,730 --> 02:06:31,290
No, I don't want to fucking listen to it
cause it's anchorman. Righteous anger. I,

2233
02:06:31,430 --> 02:06:33,700
I,
I can only on my side of the street,

2234
02:06:34,090 --> 02:06:38,830
my side of the street when I
attacked him, I was pissed. Right,

2235
02:06:39,380 --> 02:06:42,330
because you felt that he was incorrectly
correcting you and then he was putting

2236
02:06:42,331 --> 02:06:46,170
his 2 cents in. Yeah. In to an argument
that you have. It's a very big one.

2237
02:06:46,200 --> 02:06:47,870
It's not just about south by southwest,

2238
02:06:47,880 --> 02:06:51,000
but it's about a lot of
other organizations who
don't pay the performance.

2239
02:06:51,180 --> 02:06:55,350
Exactly. And I think that the tides are
shifting now and I think that that, uh,

2240
02:06:55,620 --> 02:06:59,100
paradigm where you charged money for a
shower and don't pay the comics is going

2241
02:06:59,101 --> 02:07:02,180
to hopefully be gone permanently.
Uh,

2242
02:07:02,370 --> 02:07:07,370
because what I really liked about the
south by south west video is that it,

2243
02:07:08,210 --> 02:07:11,220
it, I think it encouraged some
comedians to start speaking up.

2244
02:07:11,610 --> 02:07:15,510
And I think artists are very afraid of
confrontation and are afraid of speaking

2245
02:07:15,511 --> 02:07:19,660
up about, uh, things that
are obviously right now.

2246
02:07:20,100 --> 02:07:24,500
Here's the time to speak up and there's
a time to not speak up. And I think, uh,

2247
02:07:25,230 --> 02:07:28,980
with Brian when I,
I said,

2248
02:07:28,981 --> 02:07:32,630
you're robbing comics that wasn't
coming out of some altruism,

2249
02:07:33,660 --> 02:07:35,980
you know, uh, state of wanting

2250
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:39,640
to like be Gandy and how fucking
comics that was coming. It's like, Oh,

2251
02:07:39,641 --> 02:07:43,810
you slapped me, I'm going to slap
you back. And so that's wrong.

2252
02:07:43,930 --> 02:07:46,870
That's wrong action. That's
not skillful, that's bad.

2253
02:07:47,020 --> 02:07:52,020
And so I went on my podcasts and
I, uh, and I apologize and I, uh,

2254
02:07:52,410 --> 02:07:55,240
admitted that that was wrong.
And also I think the term robbing,

2255
02:07:55,241 --> 02:08:00,010
it's totally wrong because robbing
implies that the person that you're, um,

2256
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:02,500
it implies forcefully taking
something for someone.

2257
02:08:02,501 --> 02:08:06,820
Whereas if someone goes and does a show
with the ice house and Brian and said

2258
02:08:06,821 --> 02:08:08,710
he's not paying or it
didn't mention payment,

2259
02:08:09,010 --> 02:08:12,400
then you're entering into an agreement
where you're going to perform for free.

2260
02:08:12,670 --> 02:08:16,270
So it's more of the performers deal,
like it's,

2261
02:08:16,271 --> 02:08:20,710
you decided to go and do that. So Robin
is the wrong word. So there's that,

2262
02:08:21,160 --> 02:08:25,060
but watching it explode,
you know what I mean?

2263
02:08:25,060 --> 02:08:29,650
Watching the fireball grow
bigger and bigger. It's been, um,

2264
02:08:29,770 --> 02:08:33,640
a huge lesson for me, you know, and it
really has taught me like, fuck man,

2265
02:08:33,641 --> 02:08:35,770
you've got to learn to,
uh,

2266
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:40,150
if you're angry and especially
your anger is at a friend.

2267
02:08:40,570 --> 02:08:45,340
And even though like, I think Brian
hates my guts permanently. Nah, he was,

2268
02:08:45,420 --> 02:08:49,390
we've been friends for like,
I don't know, seven years,

2269
02:08:50,890 --> 02:08:54,040
eight years ago. Let me stab me with
a pencil. I can with a fucking pencil.

2270
02:08:55,030 --> 02:08:58,660
I'm sorry for that.
I'm sorry that I did.

2271
02:09:00,040 --> 02:09:03,160
I'll tell you this. Let me
tell you this. I'm a lot less,

2272
02:09:03,161 --> 02:09:08,161
sorry that I stabbed him with a pencil
than I am that in a fucking public forum.

2273
02:09:08,710 --> 02:09:11,740
I called him out on something that I
should have addressed privately because

2274
02:09:11,741 --> 02:09:13,420
when I stabbed him with a fucking pencil,

2275
02:09:13,600 --> 02:09:16,750
he get Pocan my back on an airplane
when I'm trying to sleep man.

2276
02:09:16,780 --> 02:09:18,580
And I had to fucking fight back.

2277
02:09:18,760 --> 02:09:21,910
I don't feel bad about that
was retarded baby is stupid.

2278
02:09:22,030 --> 02:09:24,550
But that was just an instant
reaction to being annoyed.

2279
02:09:24,730 --> 02:09:29,730
What happened at the laughing skull
was using a public forum to address a

2280
02:09:32,171 --> 02:09:36,460
private issue and I think
that that is not fucking cool.

2281
02:09:36,610 --> 02:09:40,060
And the end result of that, even though
that podcast didn't get uploaded,

2282
02:09:40,300 --> 02:09:45,300
is that we've created a fucking car dash
Ian episode with a death squad and that

2283
02:09:45,761 --> 02:09:48,190
sucks man. There's a lot of
fucking people who've been

2284
02:09:50,530 --> 02:09:54,820
taking sides and and attacking
me or attacking Brian or like,

2285
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:58,270
like all this stuff that ultimately,
so now what, what, what happens?

2286
02:09:58,271 --> 02:09:59,770
This is the fucking thing that happens.

2287
02:09:59,980 --> 02:10:04,980
You Watch this thing that started off as
a mid size negative energy ball turned

2288
02:10:05,111 --> 02:10:09,250
into a big negative energy ball and
then get fucking scattered and spread

2289
02:10:09,251 --> 02:10:13,330
throughout the fucking
Internet with people signing
up and trying to say hurtful

2290
02:10:13,331 --> 02:10:16,870
things or saying this person's right.
That person's wrong. This is good,

2291
02:10:16,871 --> 02:10:21,790
that's bad. This is why I say simplicity
is the most important thing man,

2292
02:10:21,791 --> 02:10:26,740
because it's like ultimately
you just have to say, I forgive.

2293
02:10:26,741 --> 02:10:30,790
You can pull it city man,
just forgiveness.

2294
02:10:30,791 --> 02:10:34,630
Just at some point. Simplicity
is forgiveness. No, forgiving

2295
02:10:34,630 --> 02:10:37,660
is a simple act.
It doesn't have to be complicated.

2296
02:10:37,661 --> 02:10:41,830
It doesn't have to be going into judge
Judy mode and stretching out the events

2297
02:10:41,831 --> 02:10:43,300
to see who was right,

2298
02:10:43,330 --> 02:10:45,730
who was wrong and how did you
do that and why did you do that?

2299
02:10:45,731 --> 02:10:49,720
It's just the simple thing of being
like, look, let's stop playing shit.

2300
02:10:49,721 --> 02:10:50,770
Ping Pong with negative,

2301
02:10:51,110 --> 02:10:54,800
it was back when we were talking about
earlier about like money being needed to

2302
02:10:54,870 --> 02:10:58,520
to keep score, fights
with friends. There's,

2303
02:10:58,580 --> 02:11:00,890
there's someone has to
be the one who was right.

2304
02:11:01,100 --> 02:11:02,540
Someone else to be the one who was wrong,

2305
02:11:02,660 --> 02:11:05,450
someone else's were the one who
one lawyer and someone has to lose.

2306
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:08,300
It's like when people break up a
little divorced and you're like, oh,

2307
02:11:08,301 --> 02:11:11,690
she won that one. You know, she
got out of that one pretty good.

2308
02:11:11,691 --> 02:11:14,690
She gets this amount a month and you know,
that poor fucking guy,

2309
02:11:14,691 --> 02:11:19,640
he really lost that one. It
sucks. And yeah, it's funny.
It's weird. It's weird man.

2310
02:11:19,641 --> 02:11:23,810
And it's all ego based. That's all about
our whole society is about achievement,

2311
02:11:23,840 --> 02:11:25,930
forward progress,
you know,

2312
02:11:26,540 --> 02:11:31,120
treading into New Territories and taking
them over. I mean it's one of those,

2313
02:11:31,140 --> 02:11:35,690
yeah. Whether it's actual
physical territories like
new lands or whether it's a

2314
02:11:35,691 --> 02:11:39,080
technological territory, he's like new,
you know, new inventions and innovations.

2315
02:11:39,970 --> 02:11:42,830
We're always moving forward.
So like you have to like, okay,

2316
02:11:42,831 --> 02:11:45,140
you're out of a relationship.
How'd you do? I did great.

2317
02:11:45,141 --> 02:11:49,550
Why I only married that asshole for three
years and he has to give me $1 million,

2318
02:11:49,551 --> 02:11:50,384
you know,

2319
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:53,640
look man. But you know,
like, so I think, uh,

2320
02:11:53,700 --> 02:11:55,560
I don't have anything else
to say about that. Right.

2321
02:11:55,561 --> 02:11:57,560
I think I'm done talking about that,
but I do want to say,

2322
02:11:57,690 --> 02:12:01,200
well he, his, uh, in his
defense, his, uh, what,

2323
02:12:01,250 --> 02:12:04,320
what he's upset about more than the fact
that he brought her up with a podcast

2324
02:12:04,321 --> 02:12:08,460
and did it like that and through them,
one of the bus that even in your apology,

2325
02:12:08,461 --> 02:12:12,420
you still said that he wasn't paying
the comedians and he did pay some of the

2326
02:12:12,421 --> 02:12:16,600
Comedians, you know, and apparently,
you know, I wasn't really, I,

2327
02:12:16,620 --> 02:12:19,230
I told them it'd be good
idea to pay the comedians,

2328
02:12:19,260 --> 02:12:22,260
but we never really had too
many conversations about
who got paid and who didn't.

2329
02:12:22,950 --> 02:12:27,120
It was up to his discretion.
Thomson Reuters,

2330
02:12:27,140 --> 02:12:30,030
some people got burnt Christ or something
that people got paid and so I'm good,

2331
02:12:30,300 --> 02:12:30,550
you know,

2332
02:12:30,550 --> 02:12:34,350
but there was different shows where there
wasn't that many seats that were sold,

2333
02:12:34,351 --> 02:12:38,300
you know, where he did his own shows. Two
shows a word that's successful. Right.

2334
02:12:38,380 --> 02:12:39,610
Okay.
So what,

2335
02:12:39,611 --> 02:12:44,611
so what this turns into at this
point is like real fucking like,

2336
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:50,500
to me it's like, I guess so like
if the apology's not correct,

2337
02:12:51,010 --> 02:12:54,430
then basically what we've created now is
a situation where it's like you didn't

2338
02:12:54,760 --> 02:12:59,320
submit to me properly. You know what I
mean? I don't, I don't know, like, okay,

2339
02:12:59,321 --> 02:13:04,200
I know you play fucking Cat Stevens
peace train and said that you were, uh,

2340
02:13:04,270 --> 02:13:06,590
my friend. You know what I mean? Like,

2341
02:13:06,670 --> 02:13:09,970
like I know that you did that you
didn't do it in exactly the right way.

2342
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:12,490
And then if that happens, then
it's like, okay, then what?

2343
02:13:12,491 --> 02:13:14,430
You didn't do this and I didn't do.
Now all of a sudden,

2344
02:13:14,490 --> 02:13:17,380
Shit Ping pongs happening again should
ping pong, you know what I mean?

2345
02:13:17,381 --> 02:13:21,850
And it's like, fuck man, like, isn't
like the, isn't it like the, the,

2346
02:13:22,180 --> 02:13:25,900
the best thing to do to like number one,
uh,

2347
02:13:25,990 --> 02:13:29,590
address this situation and I'm addressing
it publicly now because it was brought

2348
02:13:29,591 --> 02:13:32,070
in at the public forum. It isn't
the best that you do to address it

2349
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:36,990
privately. Isn't that the number one,
like best, best way to handle it? Um,

2350
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:37,960
and number two,

2351
02:13:37,960 --> 02:13:40,960
well boy, it wasn't his fault. It was
made public. It was really my fault.

2352
02:13:41,410 --> 02:13:44,980
I was explaining to the Ra why you guys
were in and are in an argument and you

2353
02:13:44,981 --> 02:13:47,140
know, in the middle of the
podcast we're just talking.

2354
02:13:47,141 --> 02:13:50,590
I didn't really stop and think whether
or not this is a smart thing to,

2355
02:13:51,160 --> 02:13:53,560
to re expose. Right. And, but, but,

2356
02:13:53,710 --> 02:13:56,170
but you must be upset
about how it happened.

2357
02:13:56,171 --> 02:14:01,171
And I know how I feel after every sort
of yelling argument that I've ever been

2358
02:14:01,451 --> 02:14:03,130
on. My was like, no, it was really good.

2359
02:14:03,230 --> 02:14:07,670
Tends to, I see someone saying, Fuck
Duncan Trussell in front of half,

2360
02:14:07,820 --> 02:14:12,660
possibly half a million people. That
felt really weird cause I, um, I,

2361
02:14:12,710 --> 02:14:13,460
you know,

2362
02:14:13,460 --> 02:14:18,440
like it's tough for me to imagine a
situation where I would be angry enough to

2363
02:14:18,441 --> 02:14:22,100
like try to publicly disparage
somebody in that intense away.

2364
02:14:22,520 --> 02:14:25,940
You know what I mean? I just, I, I
wouldn't, I don't think I do that.

2365
02:14:26,690 --> 02:14:28,820
And my thought was a
really fucking pissed. So

2366
02:14:31,510 --> 02:14:35,540
yeah, these trains were going to make
it all work out, bro. Well, that's my,

2367
02:14:35,550 --> 02:14:37,340
that's what I wrote.
So I'm going to come together.

2368
02:14:43,510 --> 02:14:46,840
He's trained by that
silly bitch.

2369
02:14:48,010 --> 02:14:52,690
This piece train asshole became a Muslim.
He fucking plus.

2370
02:14:53,560 --> 02:14:56,350
No Muslims are some of
something. Okay. Oh yeah.

2371
02:14:56,351 --> 02:15:00,490
But he was calling for Salmon Rushdie to
be killed when we got off a piece track.

2372
02:15:00,550 --> 02:15:04,990
It's crazy. Who was talking about how
the Quran says that someone rushed,

2373
02:15:05,020 --> 02:15:06,640
he's gotta go gotta go gotta go.

2374
02:15:10,910 --> 02:15:14,810
Recently I make a little [inaudible] cash.
Have a little bit of a comeback.

2375
02:15:14,830 --> 02:15:17,390
I saw him playing his use of Islam now.
Yeah,

2376
02:15:17,490 --> 02:15:21,550
Jack on Sa. It's very sad. Yeah,
that is a sweet song. Matt,

2377
02:15:21,740 --> 02:15:23,060
who's got a lot of great songs,

2378
02:15:23,120 --> 02:15:26,570
he's got some beautiful songs and he's
obviously an incredibly sensitive guy.

2379
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:29,060
But back to the whole situation,

2380
02:15:29,390 --> 02:15:34,070
I think you have to treat your friends
the way you treat someone that you love,

2381
02:15:34,071 --> 02:15:36,980
like a wife, you know you, you go
to, you can't, you can't insult them.

2382
02:15:37,070 --> 02:15:40,000
You can't lash out at them.
You can't do it. It's a,

2383
02:15:40,390 --> 02:15:44,210
it's a shitty thing when it happens and
you got to make it all better after it's

2384
02:15:44,211 --> 02:15:45,980
over. And you've got to,
you've got to really,

2385
02:15:45,981 --> 02:15:49,280
truly feel bad about it and you got to
really truly sort of correct yourself and

2386
02:15:49,281 --> 02:15:54,230
make sure that you never put
yourself into such a situation of a,

2387
02:15:54,231 --> 02:15:57,560
almost like verbal combat with
a brother, you know? Yes. Um,

2388
02:15:58,520 --> 02:16:01,700
Brian for sure has some
maturing to do on an, you know,

2389
02:16:01,701 --> 02:16:05,870
and I think he's aware of it himself and
he started out at a different time than

2390
02:16:05,871 --> 02:16:09,680
we did. He's a good dude
though, man. I've, I've been
with Brian for a long time.

2391
02:16:09,681 --> 02:16:14,000
We've worked together for like a decade.
He's a good dude, man. He's, uh, you know,

2392
02:16:14,001 --> 02:16:16,250
he's got a lot of Manchild in them,
but that's,

2393
02:16:16,280 --> 02:16:19,610
that's part of what makes him funny. Yeah.
That's part of what makes him unique.

2394
02:16:19,611 --> 02:16:24,270
And PS, here's the fucking thing. No
one needs to be attacking. Exactly.

2395
02:16:24,340 --> 02:16:26,120
Nobody. You guys aren't,
there's no bad guys.

2396
02:16:26,121 --> 02:16:29,190
There's no need for there to be an enemy
involved here. It's crazy. Yeah. There,

2397
02:16:29,191 --> 02:16:30,190
there's no,
there's like,

2398
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:35,100
there's this, it's like what we
got going on here with his foot,

2399
02:16:35,120 --> 02:16:38,650
whatever you want to call it, the death
squad, this podcast, our podcasts.

2400
02:16:38,680 --> 02:16:43,600
Is it an emergent art form that's
incredibly beautiful and all of us are

2401
02:16:43,601 --> 02:16:45,190
contributing to it in our own way.

2402
02:16:45,191 --> 02:16:48,550
And a lot of people seem really invested
in it and a lot of people seem to

2403
02:16:48,551 --> 02:16:51,890
authentically upset by
this fight. And, and,

2404
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:55,240
and so I think like out
of respect for this,

2405
02:16:55,300 --> 02:16:58,210
whatever this weird fucking thing
is that we're building here,

2406
02:16:58,480 --> 02:17:03,480
we've got to like learn how to forgive
each other and to let bygones be bygones

2407
02:17:05,321 --> 02:17:09,790
because otherwise the community that
we're forming is weak, you know, and then,

2408
02:17:09,820 --> 02:17:13,240
and then in a week, fucking thing's
going to fall apart. You know, you need,

2409
02:17:13,270 --> 02:17:15,100
I think you need blow outs like this.

2410
02:17:15,220 --> 02:17:17,320
I would prefer for them
to happen in private,

2411
02:17:17,470 --> 02:17:21,280
but I think in this case it got
into the public eye fine. Uh,

2412
02:17:21,610 --> 02:17:26,380
the fact that it is in the public eye
creates even more of a reason to resolve

2413
02:17:26,381 --> 02:17:28,540
it in a civilized way.

2414
02:17:28,720 --> 02:17:33,110
That doesn't mean somebody gets
hurt or somebody gets fucking, uh,

2415
02:17:33,140 --> 02:17:36,670
excommunicated or somebody
gets like permanently mad.

2416
02:17:36,671 --> 02:17:38,800
It means that because if
we can't figure it out,

2417
02:17:39,250 --> 02:17:41,890
if we can't figure out how to
resolve something as silly as this,

2418
02:17:42,850 --> 02:17:47,320
then how can we fucking talk
about stub dropping bombs? No.

2419
02:17:47,600 --> 02:17:50,890
I mean, how can we stuck when that's
what that is in the macro, right.

2420
02:17:50,920 --> 02:17:54,520
You know what I mean? And that's
why I think it takes at some point,

2421
02:17:54,521 --> 02:17:56,890
if you look at the back and
forth that happened in war,

2422
02:17:57,280 --> 02:18:00,190
it's somebody did this to someone and
then they did something back in the night

2423
02:18:00,200 --> 02:18:03,100
and something back bigger and they did
something back bigger. It goes on forever.

2424
02:18:03,490 --> 02:18:08,200
At some point you just have to be
like, I'm sorry, I forgive you.

2425
02:18:08,350 --> 02:18:09,660
I'm sorry.
And that's it.

2426
02:18:09,800 --> 02:18:11,600
And that's when Brian goes fucked.
I could trust,

2427
02:18:12,600 --> 02:18:16,470
right? Yeah. I know, man. That's the
fucking day that, but, but you know what,

2428
02:18:16,710 --> 02:18:19,590
it's like, you can only handle
your side of the street, right.

2429
02:18:19,740 --> 02:18:21,570
You know what I mean? That's all
you, that's all that you could do.

2430
02:18:21,571 --> 02:18:25,280
You can only handle your side of fucking
things. That's all you can do. That's it.

2431
02:18:25,350 --> 02:18:25,981
Yeah.
You know,

2432
02:18:25,981 --> 02:18:29,820
I think all of us get caught up in life
and stress and shit and this and that.

2433
02:18:29,821 --> 02:18:32,540
And there's words that come out of your
mouth that are poorly chosen. This,

2434
02:18:32,810 --> 02:18:37,380
this is ideas that are
expressed selfishly. No, we
all, we all make mistakes.

2435
02:18:37,410 --> 02:18:41,640
Especially when you're, you're fucking
busy and you're not getting enough sleep.

2436
02:18:41,641 --> 02:18:44,100
Real stressed out, always in the
middle of a million different things.

2437
02:18:44,101 --> 02:18:47,190
Like I know you are, and I
certainly am. I ever make mistakes.

2438
02:18:47,730 --> 02:18:49,290
People make a lot of fucking mistakes.

2439
02:18:50,170 --> 02:18:52,680
You got to know when you'd been
friends with someone for a long time.

2440
02:18:52,710 --> 02:18:57,280
The essence of who that
person is. No, you gotta,

2441
02:18:57,480 --> 02:19:02,480
you gotta be a nice guy both when you
are in charge and when you are the

2442
02:19:03,331 --> 02:19:07,200
employee or the person has to listen,
follow directions,

2443
02:19:07,201 --> 02:19:09,870
whether you're the fan or
whether you're the performer,

2444
02:19:10,080 --> 02:19:14,430
whether the police officer or the guy who
has to talk to the cop because his car

2445
02:19:14,431 --> 02:19:18,270
got stolen. You know who in the fuck you
know, we, we have to figure out a way to,

2446
02:19:18,630 --> 02:19:21,630
to always communicate with respect.

2447
02:19:21,660 --> 02:19:25,710
It's just so hard to develop a human
being that's completely and totally honest

2448
02:19:25,711 --> 02:19:29,420
that we live in this world of and
half truths and bullshit lies.

2449
02:19:29,421 --> 02:19:33,170
And then behind the lies there's things
that are true but make no sense like

2450
02:19:33,171 --> 02:19:34,010
legislation,

2451
02:19:34,011 --> 02:19:38,990
laws and all of it adds up
to be this really confusing,

2452
02:19:39,110 --> 02:19:42,920
frustrating,
unfair feeling of life in general,

2453
02:19:42,921 --> 02:19:47,360
just as a pattern of your whole
fucking situation. But all of it,

2454
02:19:47,480 --> 02:19:52,480
all of it can be cured by the simple truth
that we have to start turning on each

2455
02:19:54,501 --> 02:19:58,790
other is if we are treating ourselves,
living another life,

2456
02:19:59,140 --> 02:20:03,050
if we are all this one thing that
is born into this world in various

2457
02:20:03,051 --> 02:20:08,051
circumstances and various biological
situations in various states of the world

2458
02:20:08,871 --> 02:20:10,970
and various various climates,

2459
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:15,440
but at the soul of it all behind the
sex and behind that the, the, the, the,

2460
02:20:15,441 --> 02:20:15,681
you know,

2461
02:20:15,681 --> 02:20:20,060
the height and the weight and the
essence of what a fucking human being is.

2462
02:20:20,240 --> 02:20:23,630
Could, it could just be as easy
on you. You could be that guy,

2463
02:20:23,631 --> 02:20:27,620
you could be this guy, you were, you
are stripped of culture and language.

2464
02:20:27,800 --> 02:20:29,570
And what I am is the same thing.

2465
02:20:29,810 --> 02:20:32,900
I'm just going through this in a
completely different ride with a total

2466
02:20:32,901 --> 02:20:34,100
different flesh vehicle.

2467
02:20:34,280 --> 02:20:37,640
And we happen to see each other along
the journey and we'll become friends and

2468
02:20:37,641 --> 02:20:39,980
you know, to be in our struggle
together and enhanced each other.

2469
02:20:40,370 --> 02:20:42,740
But at the end of the day
with the same fucking thing.

2470
02:20:43,130 --> 02:20:47,150
And once we realize that I'm the same
with some poor fuck that was born in

2471
02:20:47,151 --> 02:20:50,090
Afghanistan, is living in a
cave. I'm the same as that guy.

2472
02:20:50,091 --> 02:20:52,730
I just got a real better roll the
dice and I was born in New Jersey.

2473
02:20:52,940 --> 02:20:53,980
You know what I'm saying?
I mean,

2474
02:20:54,040 --> 02:20:59,040
is that the only way we're ever going
to get over this hump of existence as if

2475
02:21:01,640 --> 02:21:06,640
we drop all the bullshit and then the
one law that we should all recognize,

2476
02:21:07,161 --> 02:21:12,161
the one thing that we should all practice
is the ideal that you were me an imu

2477
02:21:14,060 --> 02:21:19,060
and we are moving completely
different lives but inside the body,

2478
02:21:20,700 --> 02:21:23,510
inside that the booming of what
he is one who think of you.

2479
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:27,970
I could easily be you. I can easily be
my mother. I can easily do this asshole.

2480
02:21:27,980 --> 02:21:30,760
It was down the street from me that I
can't talk to cause he's dumb. I can,

2481
02:21:30,780 --> 02:21:33,620
you can do this guy. I could be that
guy. I could have been born here.

2482
02:21:33,621 --> 02:21:38,060
It's just some crazy situation where
we may I be the very same thing living

2483
02:21:38,061 --> 02:21:42,560
through different epochs, living
through different biological identities,

2484
02:21:42,561 --> 02:21:46,550
lifting through different genetics and
different social circumstances and but at

2485
02:21:46,551 --> 02:21:50,270
the root of it all, we could be the same
fucking thing. And we essentially are.

2486
02:21:50,490 --> 02:21:52,400
Yeah,
we'll essentially are for sure.

2487
02:21:52,520 --> 02:21:56,160
It's our own individual experiences
that confused the fuck out of us. If we,

2488
02:21:56,250 --> 02:21:58,280
if we really started
treating people like that,

2489
02:21:58,281 --> 02:22:00,170
if you really looked at the word bite,
that,

2490
02:22:00,470 --> 02:22:04,180
and it doesn't always mean that you're
going to give that person everything they

2491
02:22:04,190 --> 02:22:06,290
want because then you could spoil you.

2492
02:22:06,940 --> 02:22:10,300
Well, that's right. I mean it's, you can't
be phony about it. You know what I mean?

2493
02:22:10,301 --> 02:22:14,830
Like you gotta like you have to address
it from a real place. You can't be phony.

2494
02:22:15,160 --> 02:22:16,900
But if you,

2495
02:22:17,690 --> 02:22:22,690
if you have as an intention
and dealing with conflict,

2496
02:22:22,841 --> 02:22:26,250
whichever one's going
to have wanting a that

2497
02:22:27,250 --> 02:22:30,510
wanting, not just to rev
resolution, but an evolution.

2498
02:22:30,720 --> 02:22:33,750
Yeah, that's it. If that's your
fucking intention behind it,

2499
02:22:33,900 --> 02:22:36,870
it's going to work out great. Yeah,
it's going to work out okay. You,

2500
02:22:36,871 --> 02:22:40,590
it might be turbulent and might be weird,
but if that's your intention,

2501
02:22:40,740 --> 02:22:44,870
then it's a lot different
than the intention being,
I'm gonna win this, right?

2502
02:22:44,940 --> 02:22:46,110
I'm going to conquer.

2503
02:22:46,111 --> 02:22:50,580
I'm going to be the one who comes out
on top that only creates more Shit Ping

2504
02:22:50,580 --> 02:22:51,980
Pong and more negativity in the world.
Right.

2505
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:57,270
That's the thing that we've got to like
don and this thing with Brian and I'm

2506
02:22:57,271 --> 02:23:01,050
sure everyone's got an example of this
happening in their life or we'll have it

2507
02:23:01,410 --> 02:23:04,830
deal with it in a way that's
like accelerating the community,

2508
02:23:04,831 --> 02:23:08,850
making the community stronger,
making the community more.

2509
02:23:10,040 --> 02:23:13,490
How about just last karmic impact

2510
02:23:15,290 --> 02:23:16,250
outside of all that?

2511
02:23:16,251 --> 02:23:20,680
I mean it does get complicated and start
really ultra defining everything as far

2512
02:23:20,700 --> 02:23:21,710
doing it for the community,

2513
02:23:21,740 --> 02:23:26,000
but just do the do what is what feels
like the healthiest thing to do.

2514
02:23:26,001 --> 02:23:28,590
What's the healthiest thing to do?
Drop all the rest of the problems.

2515
02:23:28,591 --> 02:23:30,690
Trump on the motion.
Just drop it. It's done.

2516
02:23:30,760 --> 02:23:34,200
Trauma and learn from it and never
be that guy again. You know, we,

2517
02:23:34,201 --> 02:23:38,510
we have to accept that this was a trial
and error sort of a situation in life,

2518
02:23:38,511 --> 02:23:41,600
especially the generation that
you and I come from, you know,

2519
02:23:41,601 --> 02:23:45,980
you and your thirties me and my forties
we were essentially one of the first

2520
02:23:45,981 --> 02:23:47,750
generations to be awake.

2521
02:23:47,930 --> 02:23:52,160
We're one of the first generations to use
the internet and it's sort of exchange

2522
02:23:52,161 --> 02:23:54,470
so much information back and forth
with each other that will kind of

2523
02:23:54,471 --> 02:23:58,460
reformulating idea of how the
world works. You know, I mean,

2524
02:23:58,461 --> 02:24:02,060
we don't really necessarily trust our
parents that brought us into this thing.

2525
02:24:02,240 --> 02:24:06,890
We don't necessarily trust our parents
parents too, to have a full sort of uh,

2526
02:24:06,950 --> 02:24:11,750
an account of what, what really is going
on in this life biologically, physically,

2527
02:24:12,200 --> 02:24:13,370
geo,
politically.

2528
02:24:13,830 --> 02:24:18,830
We are one of the first generations to
truly have a decent grasp of it because

2529
02:24:19,311 --> 02:24:20,330
of our use of the Internet.

2530
02:24:20,510 --> 02:24:25,310
So we're a lot of what we're doing as
adults is essentially trying to re govern

2531
02:24:25,660 --> 02:24:26,170
our,

2532
02:24:26,170 --> 02:24:31,070
our own culture to re refigure out how
we're communicating with each other.

2533
02:24:31,220 --> 02:24:34,520
If the New York giants fans really want
to beat the fuck out of the Raiders and

2534
02:24:34,521 --> 02:24:37,610
they don't even know him, is that,
isn't there something wrong with that?

2535
02:24:37,720 --> 02:24:41,420
Like is it, could that not be us
on another side of the country?

2536
02:24:41,700 --> 02:24:44,480
When do you not understand that
you really want to go and you know,

2537
02:24:44,481 --> 02:24:47,210
you go to a fucking ball game in Philly
and they break your leg in the hallway

2538
02:24:47,211 --> 02:24:51,050
cause you're wearing the wrong shirt,
but that stuff happens. That's you man.

2539
02:24:51,080 --> 02:24:54,470
That's you on the ground
living a different life and
you just stomped on your

2540
02:24:54,471 --> 02:24:57,500
thigh bone and snapped
it. You know? And that is,

2541
02:24:57,680 --> 02:25:00,800
that's really unfortunate aspect of life.

2542
02:25:00,801 --> 02:25:04,670
This sort of a tribal thing that you know,
might've existed in that book,

2543
02:25:04,700 --> 02:25:09,590
the road in that movie. You
know what, what could happen
if the shit hits the fan,

2544
02:25:09,710 --> 02:25:12,620
but where we have to understand that this
shit's not hitting the fan right now.

2545
02:25:13,170 --> 02:25:14,750
It's not hitting the fan at all.
This is,

2546
02:25:14,751 --> 02:25:18,600
this is nothing like the shit hits the
fan. Right? Right. There was a guy,

2547
02:25:18,601 --> 02:25:23,380
but I was mentioning earlier that was
talking about how life right now that we

2548
02:25:23,381 --> 02:25:27,720
were unhappy but yet we live very much
like kings and emperors, you know,

2549
02:25:27,800 --> 02:25:28,870
did a hundred years ago,

2550
02:25:29,140 --> 02:25:34,140
which I thought was really stupid because
first of all the idea of we don't live

2551
02:25:34,181 --> 02:25:37,720
in like an emperor. You don't have
a Harem, can't order them around.

2552
02:25:37,721 --> 02:25:40,630
You can't have people
killed if they talk shit,

2553
02:25:40,840 --> 02:25:45,200
you don't have people can you around
on a giant tray every you go also,

2554
02:25:45,340 --> 02:25:49,360
you're not eating rancid fucking to
me. Yeah, you got a fridge. Yeah.

2555
02:25:49,361 --> 02:25:52,660
You're not dying from whooping cough
because nobody knows what the fuck it is.

2556
02:25:52,661 --> 02:25:54,430
And they think he got
possessed by a demon.

2557
02:25:59,290 --> 02:26:02,730
But can I tell you about something? I
don't know how long I've been doing this,

2558
02:26:02,731 --> 02:26:07,230
but please, can you look
something up dude? Yeah, sure.
Augmented reality, sandbox,

2559
02:26:07,440 --> 02:26:11,670
augmented reality sandbox, this fucking
thing man is he can't living in the best.

2560
02:26:11,700 --> 02:26:16,700
It's a Xbox connect set up over a
sandbox or the projector blasting flowing

2561
02:26:17,611 --> 02:26:21,630
water into it. So as you like move
your finger through the sandbox,

2562
02:26:21,631 --> 02:26:25,080
like water flows around
and like grass forms.

2563
02:26:25,081 --> 02:26:27,210
It's like the future of video games,
man.

2564
02:26:27,220 --> 02:26:32,220
Especially with this new quantum sand
that apparently computers can construct

2565
02:26:32,611 --> 02:26:36,510
into shapes they're talking about.
Did you find it? Whoa. Yeah Dude.

2566
02:26:36,780 --> 02:26:39,690
What the fuck is this man?
It's fucking bad ass.

2567
02:26:40,200 --> 02:26:41,580
So explain it one more time please.

2568
02:26:41,790 --> 02:26:46,790
It is an x-box connect that somehow
detecting changes in the terrain of the

2569
02:26:47,881 --> 02:26:52,020
sandbox and projecting water and uh,

2570
02:26:52,080 --> 02:26:55,950
grass and sand over different parts of it.

2571
02:26:55,950 --> 02:26:59,370
I think based on how high
or how low the sand is.

2572
02:26:59,670 --> 02:27:04,020
So if you like go really like if you hold
your hand over it makes water up here

2573
02:27:04,021 --> 02:27:07,350
running through the sandbox and if
you run your fingers through it,

2574
02:27:07,410 --> 02:27:11,100
I think water appears as though there was
like water under the sand at the beach.

2575
02:27:11,550 --> 02:27:15,660
You don't want my fucking computer
runs slow as shit probably when you're

2576
02:27:15,661 --> 02:27:20,110
streaming a podcast. When I'm streaming
a podcast. What's that about? Well,

2577
02:27:20,120 --> 02:27:23,000
it's cause I guess there's only a
certain amount of bandwidth that's weak.

2578
02:27:23,670 --> 02:27:26,100
Is it really that hard
to make a podcast folks?

2579
02:27:27,080 --> 02:27:31,230
I know every time I try to
go online it's slug like,

2580
02:27:33,900 --> 02:27:36,570
I'm sorry. So I was looking
that up with augmented reality.

2581
02:27:36,571 --> 02:27:41,310
I'm trying to pull up the youtube video.
It's just so cool.

2582
02:27:41,430 --> 02:27:45,150
It's just, okay, now
I'm looking at it. Wow.

2583
02:27:46,470 --> 02:27:48,660
And so how has it work?
Uh,

2584
02:27:48,661 --> 02:27:53,160
and the x box connect I
think identifies distances.

2585
02:27:53,161 --> 02:27:55,250
I don't know how it, how
it works. People have,

2586
02:27:55,860 --> 02:28:00,860
so you're drawing in the sandbox
and then as you scoop up Sam,

2587
02:28:01,070 --> 02:28:04,740
the sandbox, it, it's showing
on a projection screen.

2588
02:28:04,800 --> 02:28:08,700
It's projecting directly onto
the sand. Why am I above? Yeah,

2589
02:28:08,970 --> 02:28:12,540
rejecting changes in colors
and it looks very psychedelic.

2590
02:28:12,640 --> 02:28:16,640
Super sack about your trip. A kid out,
make kid make sand castles and that shit

2591
02:28:18,200 --> 02:28:22,400
man. Next level, next level sandcastles.
Check starcraft on that fucking

2592
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:27,220
thing. I'm gone.

2593
02:28:27,800 --> 02:28:28,633
I'm gone.

2594
02:28:28,690 --> 02:28:32,060
You're going to star trek star craft
it every day in my life was just like

2595
02:28:32,061 --> 02:28:35,570
downtime till Prometheans
comes out. I'm just like, what?

2596
02:28:35,720 --> 02:28:40,720
I would like to clone Ridley Scott and
give him an infinite budget and just give

2597
02:28:41,031 --> 02:28:46,031
them all the acid and mushrooms she
needs and him and HR Geiger and just lock

2598
02:28:46,161 --> 02:28:50,510
them in a room together and just make
a million alien movies. I swear to God,

2599
02:28:50,511 --> 02:28:52,340
I'm in thinking about inducing a calm.

2600
02:28:52,341 --> 02:28:54,650
I just to wake up and yelled
to go to from atheists

2601
02:28:57,070 --> 02:29:01,730
want so awesome though. It's so
dorky. Delicious. I can't wait.

2602
02:29:01,790 --> 02:29:06,140
So you were saying about um, this, uh,
my, my lust to go see the Avengers.

2603
02:29:06,141 --> 02:29:08,420
I feel like I'm getting away
with something. I really do.

2604
02:29:08,900 --> 02:29:12,050
I'm going to bring the Mustang to the
stupidest fucking kid car that I had.

2605
02:29:12,910 --> 02:29:17,750
This fucking, I have a Shelby
gt 500. It's just rude,

2606
02:29:17,751 --> 02:29:21,980
loud, Super American car.
It's so American man.

2607
02:29:22,010 --> 02:29:22,970
Everything about it.

2608
02:29:23,260 --> 02:29:26,660
They don't make another Carl didn't know
no one in the rest of the world makes a

2609
02:29:26,661 --> 02:29:30,860
car like a Shelby Mustang slides
all over the place. It's really,

2610
02:29:30,861 --> 02:29:34,850
it handles pretty well considering I
went and test drove cars yesterday.

2611
02:29:34,860 --> 02:29:38,170
Man there are so fucking nice after
you've been driving around it.

2612
02:29:38,270 --> 02:29:43,270
89 fall out off cars or cars or the
one one my my number one technological

2613
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:49,670
thrill. Like the thing that I enjoy the
most. I just love the craftsmanship.

2614
02:29:49,790 --> 02:29:51,590
I love how someone's created something.

2615
02:29:51,591 --> 02:29:55,250
I love the different philosophies
behind cars at the high revving cars of

2616
02:29:55,251 --> 02:29:59,990
Germany or the like the deep low
torque muscle cars of America.

2617
02:29:59,991 --> 02:30:01,970
I just,
I think they're fascinating to me.

2618
02:30:01,971 --> 02:30:04,730
It's they're moving works
of art that they sell.

2619
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:06,620
You know like if you buy a new corvette,

2620
02:30:06,621 --> 02:30:08,750
like there's a lot of people that think
Corvettes or douchey cause a lot of

2621
02:30:08,751 --> 02:30:12,200
douchebags drive Corvettes.
Well Corvettes are fucking amazing.

2622
02:30:12,230 --> 02:30:16,280
It's an amazing piece of
construction and engineering do.

2623
02:30:16,310 --> 02:30:18,230
But isn't that a funny
thing where like Pete,

2624
02:30:18,231 --> 02:30:21,170
because people think they're
supposed to think it's not cold.

2625
02:30:22,390 --> 02:30:26,930
An object can get a douche
bag. Its reputation and most
of your with that object.

2626
02:30:27,740 --> 02:30:31,030
Sorry it was that my fucking
phone. Sorry. You have

2627
02:30:33,350 --> 02:30:38,290
ridiculous motherfucker. Yeah, a forest
horn. Oh okay. Turn that Shit on mute son.

2628
02:30:38,390 --> 02:30:40,910
I don't know how is almost
done on the side of it.

2629
02:30:40,970 --> 02:30:43,820
I won't turn down all the way
it goes to vibrate. Stupid.

2630
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,940
The thing on the side of the
above when your fingers are,

2631
02:30:47,240 --> 02:30:51,710
when you fuck finger is that fuck
finger, that finger right there, man.

2632
02:30:51,800 --> 02:30:53,210
The chooses crunching and retarded.

2633
02:30:53,300 --> 02:30:57,380
There's a little lever on the top of the
side of your phone. The top of the side.

2634
02:30:57,381 --> 02:30:59,630
You see that? Yeah. That
shuts it to vibrate. Yes. Ah.

2635
02:30:59,710 --> 02:31:03,580
That changed my life so retarded.
All this shit.

2636
02:31:05,140 --> 02:31:09,360
How do you not know how to fucking turn
your vibrator eyes? The man at night,

2637
02:31:09,420 --> 02:31:13,100
that fucking warrants come waking
me up. Oh my God. You idiot

2638
02:31:16,210 --> 02:31:18,230
fucking idiot.

2639
02:31:18,231 --> 02:31:23,231
You didn't know how the fuck do you
have an iPhone and not know where the

2640
02:31:23,251 --> 02:31:28,020
vibrate button is can make me sad,

2641
02:31:28,470 --> 02:31:30,720
man. You fucking just
changed my life, man.

2642
02:31:34,660 --> 02:31:37,920
Fucking bother me nonstop to,

2643
02:31:38,040 --> 02:31:41,040
I've been looking at some of these
android phones they have now.

2644
02:31:41,070 --> 02:31:44,040
I know I get like a lusty
envy with certain phones,

2645
02:31:44,340 --> 02:31:46,800
but one of them have been
looking at is this galaxy note.

2646
02:31:46,801 --> 02:31:49,530
I've been watching videos and one of the
things that everybody keeps saying is

2647
02:31:49,680 --> 02:31:50,940
once you get this thing,

2648
02:31:51,120 --> 02:31:55,740
it's really hard to go back to her regular
phone cause it's five inches wide and

2649
02:31:55,741 --> 02:31:56,580
it's four G.

2650
02:31:56,581 --> 02:32:00,930
It's wicked fast is a crazy fast processor
and I'm watching these people use it,

2651
02:32:00,931 --> 02:32:04,080
play with it online and take pictures
with it and draw on the picture like he

2652
02:32:04,081 --> 02:32:05,280
right,
like almost stupid.

2653
02:32:05,490 --> 02:32:09,480
And you could send it in email or
sending a text message and browsing the

2654
02:32:09,481 --> 02:32:13,830
Internet. I mean it's fucking huge
man. It's five inches. Yeah man.

2655
02:32:13,831 --> 02:32:16,770
I feel like the little screen
on the iPhone, it's not enough.

2656
02:32:16,800 --> 02:32:19,850
I think it gives you eyestrain bad
thing. It fucks up your eyes. Just thing.

2657
02:32:19,860 --> 02:32:21,690
It's better. This fucking
things better. I may switch.

2658
02:32:21,720 --> 02:32:24,600
I may switch from the iPhone to this.
Not that it's switched from the iPhone.

2659
02:32:24,601 --> 02:32:26,940
No say that man.
But these new ice cream sandwich,

2660
02:32:26,970 --> 02:32:30,000
Google phones are pretty fucking
complicated, man. They're,

2661
02:32:30,120 --> 02:32:33,750
they're really bad at taking that
risk again. Knowing kiss my ass.

2662
02:32:34,050 --> 02:32:36,880
I had a fucking shit boy for so long.

2663
02:32:36,881 --> 02:32:40,530
It really not like those old Android's
though. I picked up a shit android once.

2664
02:32:40,800 --> 02:32:44,670
I had a shit android for one day and I was
like, this is a drunk, retarded iPhone.

2665
02:32:44,671 --> 02:32:48,330
It was really bad. This is perfect,
but these aren't like that.

2666
02:32:48,331 --> 02:32:49,590
These new ones are not like that.

2667
02:32:49,620 --> 02:32:53,730
This new operating systems called ice
cream sandwich and apparently it's the

2668
02:32:53,731 --> 02:32:58,731
shit they in the new Samsung Galaxy three
that's another one that just came out

2669
02:32:59,011 --> 02:33:02,370
in England. I don't think it's all out
in America yet. That's another huge one.

2670
02:33:02,371 --> 02:33:06,330
It's like 4.8 inch screen
and Norma screen not,

2671
02:33:06,360 --> 02:33:07,590
not quite as big as the note.

2672
02:33:07,591 --> 02:33:11,850
The note is like five plus I think five
three but it's a huge screen and like

2673
02:33:11,851 --> 02:33:15,290
when you touched the outside of it
rip, it was like water. It's like it's,

2674
02:33:15,540 --> 02:33:19,140
it's got the effect that there's water
on it. When you rub your hand across it,

2675
02:33:19,141 --> 02:33:21,690
it takes a snapshot of the screen
if that's all you have to do.

2676
02:33:21,850 --> 02:33:25,730
It's like you're a magician, which you
do that. They're bad ass man. Yeah.

2677
02:33:25,920 --> 02:33:29,760
Which is going to lead to a
lot of accidental screenshots,

2678
02:33:29,761 --> 02:33:31,060
but people are going to be fucking,

2679
02:33:31,130 --> 02:33:33,720
that dropped their phone in the
ground and it looks like it's a swipe,

2680
02:33:33,721 --> 02:33:35,530
but really it's just passing by a Dick.

2681
02:33:36,400 --> 02:33:41,400
Take pictures of ball sacs and
all kinds of unexpected shit.

2682
02:33:41,640 --> 02:33:45,570
All kinds of, what's the word we're
looking for? Candid, candid shot.

2683
02:33:46,270 --> 02:33:49,560
Camden. Random Vagina shots. Whoa.

2684
02:33:50,370 --> 02:33:54,420
What happened? This is an
adult to screenshots. Yeah.

2685
02:33:54,421 --> 02:33:58,260
There's a lot of the camera's view, dude.
My team. You know what I'm afraid of, man?

2686
02:33:58,290 --> 02:34:00,900
I'm afraid that like,
what's here's what's going to happen.

2687
02:34:00,901 --> 02:34:03,840
This is what I think's going to happen
to me when I get conspiratorial and worry

2688
02:34:03,841 --> 02:34:06,190
about the crazy shit we
talk about on here. Oh,

2689
02:34:06,240 --> 02:34:09,840
I think one day the feds are going
to come, they're going to take me,

2690
02:34:09,990 --> 02:34:12,870
they're going to do the old Bill Hicks
thing where they take you into a room,

2691
02:34:13,370 --> 02:34:15,810
but instead of showing a
video of an assassination,

2692
02:34:16,080 --> 02:34:20,560
they're going to show a screen
filled with mov and meet, jerking off

2693
02:34:21,860 --> 02:34:26,450
what one your camera is, right.
They're all there and next to it,

2694
02:34:26,520 --> 02:34:27,231
the different things.

2695
02:34:27,231 --> 02:34:30,350
I was jerking off to and they're going
to show me that and be like, hey man,

2696
02:34:30,530 --> 02:34:32,150
you want to keep saying the hippy shit?

2697
02:34:32,700 --> 02:34:35,450
You want to keep talking about that cause
look I want to keep talking and he'd

2698
02:34:35,451 --> 02:34:38,980
be boy, hey what's this? What's
this? Is this German? Is Porn junk?

2699
02:34:38,990 --> 02:34:40,710
And that you are looking at who's,

2700
02:34:40,820 --> 02:34:44,930
is it possible to convert the entire
government into a positive force?

2701
02:34:44,960 --> 02:34:48,320
Is it possible to have people that are
really looking out to do the right thing

2702
02:34:48,590 --> 02:34:52,430
and get it all together or is the
job of working for the government?

2703
02:34:52,431 --> 02:34:57,431
So fucking unrewarding and boring but
everyone just falls into a place of non

2704
02:34:57,681 --> 02:34:58,514
innovation.

2705
02:34:58,550 --> 02:35:02,840
Non-Responsibility thanking the diffusion
of responsibility that comes with the

2706
02:35:02,841 --> 02:35:06,800
corporation also falls upon you when
you're in government. It's just,

2707
02:35:07,130 --> 02:35:10,310
it seems so few, a few
tiles. It seems so huge.

2708
02:35:10,311 --> 02:35:13,970
It seems so impossible that you
just sort of give up and come.

2709
02:35:14,240 --> 02:35:15,390
You just become a part of the wave.

2710
02:35:15,950 --> 02:35:18,890
Right now it's,
I don't know how you fix it.

2711
02:35:19,100 --> 02:35:23,780
So like all I can think about is
like, uh, in the micro you fix it.

2712
02:35:23,781 --> 02:35:24,680
And if every,
if I'm,

2713
02:35:24,690 --> 02:35:28,370
the majority of people start improving
the their lives and the lives of people

2714
02:35:28,371 --> 02:35:31,490
around them and actively seeking to
put positive energy out in the world.

2715
02:35:31,820 --> 02:35:34,670
And maybe that'll sort of, um, uh,

2716
02:35:34,700 --> 02:35:37,250
transform the government
itself in a real way.

2717
02:35:37,550 --> 02:35:42,550
But as long as people are getting
caught up worrying about the macro and

2718
02:35:43,011 --> 02:35:46,190
thinking that everything's coming to a
screeching halt and everything's fucked

2719
02:35:46,191 --> 02:35:50,000
up and they might as well just live like
idiots and give up trying to be happy,

2720
02:35:50,190 --> 02:35:50,631
then shit,

2721
02:35:50,631 --> 02:35:54,170
we'll keep continue to perpetuate
itself in the neck in a negative way.

2722
02:35:54,380 --> 02:35:58,730
So I think the idea is it's like,
yeah, things are fucked up the world.

2723
02:35:58,790 --> 02:36:01,580
Nancy Grace's world is
a Shitty fucking world,

2724
02:36:01,760 --> 02:36:06,620
but let's not worry about Landlease
Linnux got strangled in the everglades and

2725
02:36:06,621 --> 02:36:10,460
let's start worrying about the way that
we're treating our fucking why for our

2726
02:36:10,461 --> 02:36:13,100
friends or our kids or whatever,
and deal with that.

2727
02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:15,020
And then if enough people
started doing that,

2728
02:36:15,280 --> 02:36:17,570
and I think a big change would
happen in the world, man,

2729
02:36:17,970 --> 02:36:19,200
definitely change.
Look,

2730
02:36:19,201 --> 02:36:22,410
everybody can change and everybody
can change their own environment by

2731
02:36:22,411 --> 02:36:25,620
surrounding yourself with other people
that are like minded. That is possible.

2732
02:36:25,800 --> 02:36:28,230
And that's one of the things that
I think that this podcast does.

2733
02:36:28,560 --> 02:36:30,440
We've talked about this
before, but it's a, it's,

2734
02:36:30,500 --> 02:36:34,470
it's important to recognize that
we're aware of this, that this,

2735
02:36:34,471 --> 02:36:37,440
this is not something that existed
when we were young. We didn't,

2736
02:36:37,470 --> 02:36:42,390
we didn't have access to people
that were just for sort of no real,

2737
02:36:43,550 --> 02:36:47,370
I mean there's no, I want to say
a no obligation. There's no real

2738
02:36:48,880 --> 02:36:51,720
direction that we're trying to go with us.

2739
02:36:51,930 --> 02:36:54,960
We are just trying to express
ourselves 100% honestly. Yeah.

2740
02:36:54,990 --> 02:36:58,890
There's no ulterior motive.
There's no agenda. There's no,

2741
02:36:59,130 --> 02:37:03,240
there's no deception. It's just this is,
this is how we really view the world.

2742
02:37:03,300 --> 02:37:03,510
Right?

2743
02:37:03,510 --> 02:37:07,920
And when you're stuck somewhere and you
don't have people like that around you,

2744
02:37:08,100 --> 02:37:10,500
this is the only way you can get that.
And through this,

2745
02:37:10,980 --> 02:37:12,930
it allows people to connect light,
mine,

2746
02:37:12,960 --> 02:37:15,890
likeminded people to connect through
Twitter and through Facebook and whatever.

2747
02:37:16,150 --> 02:37:21,150
And they seek each other out and improve
the actual environment they live in.

2748
02:37:21,530 --> 02:37:24,530
And then it starts these exponential
changes all over the world.

2749
02:37:24,710 --> 02:37:29,450
That's the one way, in my opinion,
whenever we change any government anyways,

2750
02:37:29,451 --> 02:37:33,500
expose them to new ideas that are more
satisfying than the stupid dumb conquer

2751
02:37:33,501 --> 02:37:36,260
model that they'd been using
since before the days of gangs.

2752
02:37:36,710 --> 02:37:38,510
That's it, man. We got to figure that out.

2753
02:37:38,511 --> 02:37:40,370
We have to figure out
what that looks like.

2754
02:37:40,560 --> 02:37:43,990
Well that's the, it looks
like the Internet. That's
sort of both sides. Reddit,

2755
02:37:44,140 --> 02:37:45,820
do you ever notice the
only thing that exactly it,

2756
02:37:46,050 --> 02:37:48,720
the owner knows the only
thing that doesn't, doesn't
want to hear your bullshit.

2757
02:37:49,140 --> 02:37:53,860
You know, there, there's, there's isolated
pockets, there's isolated, you know,

2758
02:37:53,861 --> 02:37:57,990
places where you can go like Stormfront
websites and we can do is go hang out

2759
02:37:57,991 --> 02:38:00,460
with only Nazis and you know,
they'll have, you know what I mean?

2760
02:38:00,461 --> 02:38:03,420
And we didn't do a lot of those out there.
You could just do that.

2761
02:38:03,421 --> 02:38:07,440
But the overwhelming
social network interaction,

2762
02:38:07,680 --> 02:38:12,210
the overwhelming experience seems to
be the distribution of information.

2763
02:38:12,600 --> 02:38:15,510
You know, there's good and
bad, you know? Good and bad,

2764
02:38:15,750 --> 02:38:19,830
but the district distribution of
information, the exposure of reality.

2765
02:38:20,100 --> 02:38:21,600
Yeah,
it's incredible man.

2766
02:38:21,601 --> 02:38:25,470
And it's like definitely if you look back
at history and the way power is always

2767
02:38:25,471 --> 02:38:30,180
fought to subvert the flow of information
and suddenly there's a thing that is

2768
02:38:30,181 --> 02:38:34,540
like a truth volcano now and there's no
way to put a fucking cork on it. Yeah,

2769
02:38:34,660 --> 02:38:35,650
no dude,
if we had this,

2770
02:38:35,651 --> 02:38:38,980
if this was a radio show and we
were in 1916 is a pirate radio show,

2771
02:38:39,220 --> 02:38:41,900
they put us in jail. Oh yeah. They
would come after us and punish them.

2772
02:38:41,901 --> 02:38:46,901
Jail giant difference between the world
of post 1993 which is really sort of the

2773
02:38:48,431 --> 02:38:51,460
one of the first few years of the Internet
being like a public entity that I can

2774
02:38:51,461 --> 02:38:54,250
remember and maybe it happened a few
years before that for the real hardcore

2775
02:38:54,251 --> 02:38:58,780
guys like the real hardcore geeks. But for
me, 1993 is about what it, and that's a,

2776
02:38:58,781 --> 02:39:01,540
that's a different fucking era.

2777
02:39:01,690 --> 02:39:05,440
There might as well been before that
there was no cell phones either.

2778
02:39:05,441 --> 02:39:07,650
All around happened at the
same time as well, you know,

2779
02:39:07,710 --> 02:39:10,240
essentially in a few years post,
you know,

2780
02:39:10,241 --> 02:39:15,241
it all kind of bubbled together into
one big sort of a community can of soup.

2781
02:39:15,800 --> 02:39:17,120
Yeah, man. It's incredible.

2782
02:39:17,121 --> 02:39:21,050
And it's also incredible
how positive it it can be.

2783
02:39:21,150 --> 02:39:26,100
Can Be. Yeah. Yeah. This, yeah,
this more positive for us, you know,

2784
02:39:26,101 --> 02:39:29,970
for sure and more positive at the shows
and what are people enjoying themselves.

2785
02:39:30,240 --> 02:39:32,580
We were having shows a way
we've never had before.

2786
02:39:32,850 --> 02:39:35,910
So the kind of shows were having where
we're going and thousands of people were

2787
02:39:35,911 --> 02:39:39,390
there and the thousands of people
are screaming and having fun and,

2788
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:44,520
and this is just more massive burst of
positive energy will that massive bursa

2789
02:39:44,670 --> 02:39:48,510
positive energy all came out of doing
something like this, doing this podcast,

2790
02:39:48,630 --> 02:39:51,750
connecting with all those people out
there flowing their head with something to

2791
02:39:51,751 --> 02:39:52,860
think about while they're working,

2792
02:39:52,861 --> 02:39:56,250
while they're doing mundane tasks
where the commuting all of it for free,

2793
02:39:56,340 --> 02:39:58,680
all of it without an
agenda and all of that.

2794
02:39:58,710 --> 02:40:02,490
We'll see the what it does is it spreads
out more positivity and it makes you

2795
02:40:02,491 --> 02:40:06,070
want to write more shit and it makes you
want to perform more comedy and get you

2796
02:40:06,330 --> 02:40:09,510
have more material for them
and do more shows and okay. And

2797
02:40:09,520 --> 02:40:14,220
it fucking rocks your consciousness when
the, when the freaks you and say, Hey,

2798
02:40:14,221 --> 02:40:18,970
listen, I, I'm a, I'm a fellow,
my disciple of crawling.

2799
02:40:19,370 --> 02:40:23,100
Hey, why don't you check out this book
book for and then you order, all right,

2800
02:40:23,101 --> 02:40:25,740
I'll fucking get booked for,
and then you're reading crawling.

2801
02:40:25,741 --> 02:40:29,790
Suddenly you're like, holy fucking
shit. This is some intense shit here.

2802
02:40:29,791 --> 02:40:33,900
Some of this is right on and real or
that Guy Matt stacks from this info.

2803
02:40:34,110 --> 02:40:36,240
I love you.
He sent me all these fucking books.

2804
02:40:36,390 --> 02:40:39,450
I've been reading these books and getting
stoned and reading these books and

2805
02:40:39,451 --> 02:40:42,050
just start shuttering and stoner or like,
or

2806
02:40:42,180 --> 02:40:45,060
did you fucking getting the
Catholic Church? All this shit

2807
02:40:45,880 --> 02:40:46,241
set over.

2808
02:40:46,241 --> 02:40:49,930
The Catholic church is all coming from
this one fucking book that he sent to me.

2809
02:40:50,080 --> 02:40:51,790
And, and that's the
other cool thing. Yeah,

2810
02:40:51,870 --> 02:40:54,300
that's good.
If you don't know about this info,

2811
02:40:54,420 --> 02:40:58,990
just go out and get your being
lied to. Yeah. It's amazing.

2812
02:40:59,000 --> 02:40:59,833
It's amazing.

2813
02:40:59,950 --> 02:41:04,530
Anybody says there's no conspiracies is
a fucking idiot because like as we were

2814
02:41:04,531 --> 02:41:08,070
talking about with the nine 11 there
had to be a conspiracy in the dynamic on

2815
02:41:08,071 --> 02:41:08,880
the enemy's side.

2816
02:41:08,880 --> 02:41:12,840
So there are conspiracies and human
nature and they do pull things off and if

2817
02:41:12,841 --> 02:41:15,390
you don't think they have in the past,
you're being silly.

2818
02:41:15,580 --> 02:41:18,690
You're being incredibly silly.
That's how it runs.

2819
02:41:18,820 --> 02:41:22,360
Yeah. But yeah, it's, there's
obviously conspiracies.

2820
02:41:22,361 --> 02:41:25,810
There needs to be conspiracies. How about
every time you fucking, I mean, yeah,

2821
02:41:25,811 --> 02:41:30,050
there's many conspiracies and
huge conspiracies anyway. Yeah,

2822
02:41:30,051 --> 02:41:31,240
it's what the whole point is.

2823
02:41:31,420 --> 02:41:34,150
What we have going on here
is not a one sided thing.

2824
02:41:34,151 --> 02:41:37,810
We've got a conversation afterwards.
People where they, anytime, yeah,

2825
02:41:37,870 --> 02:41:41,380
they were connecting with
people and that's why it's
so cool to do those things.

2826
02:41:41,381 --> 02:41:42,490
We'll do after the show,

2827
02:41:42,670 --> 02:41:46,630
we'd go out and take pictures of
people for fucking hours for hours.

2828
02:41:46,690 --> 02:41:50,370
We just go wade out into the
crowd and take pictures. I'm
fine. That's right. Yeah.

2829
02:41:50,500 --> 02:41:55,270
And these people are overwhelmingly
cool. Overwhelmingly cool. I,

2830
02:41:55,280 --> 02:41:59,040
yeah, 99.9% nine nine
nine nine nine. Yeah.

2831
02:41:59,140 --> 02:42:01,660
And even the ones on our core just
fucking probably just freaking out.

2832
02:42:02,720 --> 02:42:05,770
Just a little too drunk. I have
noticed a little bit of that. Yeah.

2833
02:42:05,950 --> 02:42:10,430
Fucking poor drunks.
Wow. Sad bitches. Yeah.

2834
02:42:10,570 --> 02:42:12,240
But it's uh, it's, other than that,

2835
02:42:12,250 --> 02:42:16,990
it's been overwhelmingly positive and
that all came from this one thing.

2836
02:42:17,290 --> 02:42:21,070
You know, it all, it, all, it
all came from this one idea,

2837
02:42:21,190 --> 02:42:26,020
this desire to express yourself and
express information, discuss things,

2838
02:42:26,290 --> 02:42:29,320
and to force ourselves to have these
conversations on a regular basis.

2839
02:42:29,620 --> 02:42:30,430
And Duncan and I,

2840
02:42:30,430 --> 02:42:33,190
we started having these conversations
when he was working at the comedy store

2841
02:42:33,490 --> 02:42:37,030
and are very similar.
That's how we became friends.

2842
02:42:37,270 --> 02:42:39,220
Donovan was the guy who you'd
call and he'd say, Hey man,

2843
02:42:39,221 --> 02:42:42,370
I'm going to be in town Friday and
Saturday he drove me up and Duncan would,

2844
02:42:42,400 --> 02:42:42,790
you know,

2845
02:42:42,790 --> 02:42:46,000
he would write down the lineups and the
given the Mitzi and Mitzi would decide

2846
02:42:46,001 --> 02:42:49,060
like, where to put everybody. So
Duncan may not call him up. Hey man,

2847
02:42:49,080 --> 02:42:51,580
we'll be in town Friday. What's going on.
I'm like, dude, I just read this book.

2848
02:42:51,581 --> 02:42:52,414
Okay.

2849
02:42:53,340 --> 02:42:57,220
And we would go into these crazy fucking
rabbit hole conversations because

2850
02:42:57,221 --> 02:43:00,640
sometimes the phone wouldn't ring at
the comedy store for an hour, you know?

2851
02:43:00,641 --> 02:43:02,590
So you and I would just keep talking.

2852
02:43:02,950 --> 02:43:06,910
We'll just have long ass
crazy conversations about
all kinds of weird shit.

2853
02:43:07,380 --> 02:43:08,940
Yeah man. But you know, like you,

2854
02:43:08,941 --> 02:43:13,540
you pretty much gave me like my big break
cause you started taking me out on the

2855
02:43:13,541 --> 02:43:16,270
road with you when I sucked.

2856
02:43:18,650 --> 02:43:21,160
Well I, you know, you
always had potential.

2857
02:43:21,670 --> 02:43:25,390
No it wasn't that you saw that
and that meant a lot. Cause like,

2858
02:43:25,510 --> 02:43:28,750
like having like you'd be like,
hey man, like I can remember,

2859
02:43:28,810 --> 02:43:30,370
I'll never forget this shit man.

2860
02:43:30,371 --> 02:43:34,630
I can remember being in the Olr and doing
this joke. I don't even do it anymore.

2861
02:43:34,750 --> 02:43:38,680
But it was like being in
a bad relationship is like
having an octopus stuck to

2862
02:43:38,681 --> 02:43:40,780
your face every once in a
while it whispers to you.

2863
02:43:40,781 --> 02:43:44,050
Do you still have some dumb joke?

2864
02:43:44,290 --> 02:43:46,930
But I remember like you saw
that and after it you're like,

2865
02:43:46,960 --> 02:43:50,230
that was fucking funny
man. And I was like, Whoa,

2866
02:43:50,231 --> 02:43:54,180
Holy Shit Man Brogan thinks that
joke's fight. That was a big moment.

2867
02:43:54,220 --> 02:43:58,300
You really do help. Like a lot of young
comics man, you up a lot of fucking car.

2868
02:43:58,330 --> 02:44:03,150
You like really have like a, a, a sort
of patron thing happening with people.

2869
02:44:03,280 --> 02:44:05,350
Well that's nice if that's true. I, I,

2870
02:44:05,430 --> 02:44:09,370
I love comedy man is still my favorite
thing to watch as an audience member.

2871
02:44:09,430 --> 02:44:12,580
You know, I think it's the greatest art
form where is as far as me, you know,

2872
02:44:12,581 --> 02:44:14,140
like what,
what entertains me.

2873
02:44:14,141 --> 02:44:17,440
I'll just love watching a good comic
more than anything. So I, you know,

2874
02:44:17,441 --> 02:44:19,870
I love like helping,

2875
02:44:20,260 --> 02:44:22,600
I love watching guys become killers.

2876
02:44:23,140 --> 02:44:27,340
I remember watching Ari Shaffir go from
being the guy who was like kind of a

2877
02:44:27,341 --> 02:44:30,970
little bit uncomfortable on stage, trying
to find his feet to one day, you know,

2878
02:44:30,971 --> 02:44:34,000
just slowly but surely becoming a killer.
And now I just watch,

2879
02:44:34,001 --> 02:44:38,200
I'm so seeing Ari crushed in front of
thousands of people and I remember taking

2880
02:44:38,201 --> 02:44:40,270
him on the road. Yeah, I
remember I took him to Denver.

2881
02:44:41,080 --> 02:44:43,570
I was taking Mike and Mike Young
couldn't make it for some reason,

2882
02:44:43,750 --> 02:44:47,800
so it took Ari and Ari just fucking
lit the place on fire. And I was like,

2883
02:44:47,801 --> 02:44:51,130
God Damn, look at all I should fear. All
of a sudden he's a, he's a real comedian.

2884
02:44:51,250 --> 02:44:51,971
It's beautiful.

2885
02:44:51,971 --> 02:44:56,710
It's beautiful to watch your friends grow
and prosper and become real comedians.

2886
02:44:57,090 --> 02:44:59,370
Fucking encouraged me to do it.

2887
02:44:59,380 --> 02:45:03,710
The pop it ag and fucking crabs.
It could never work.

2888
02:45:04,860 --> 02:45:09,260
I'd be like, just do it. No,
fuck them. That's your bit.

2889
02:45:09,261 --> 02:45:11,450
It was awesome. Brilliant.
But a lot of fucking,

2890
02:45:11,480 --> 02:45:15,400
a lot of comments we're bringing people
on the road of them would not racking,

2891
02:45:15,770 --> 02:45:17,900
recommend before their sets be like,
hey dude,

2892
02:45:18,140 --> 02:45:21,160
do that fucking really
uncomfortable safety

2893
02:45:24,230 --> 02:45:27,920
cause I want to put it like to come out,
do a horrified crap.

2894
02:45:27,940 --> 02:45:31,250
Not just the crowd that's like,
like seeing someone bomb but a crowd.

2895
02:45:31,251 --> 02:45:36,251
It's like maybe seeing like either someone
who's as schizophrenia or like a say

2896
02:45:36,510 --> 02:45:37,343
tannic.

2897
02:45:38,840 --> 02:45:42,540
Well, you know, I mean, I had this
conversation with all he wants, uh,

2898
02:45:42,610 --> 02:45:46,670
on the road when we're talking about
trying out new stuff and bombing or you

2899
02:45:46,671 --> 02:45:48,870
know, or what have you,
you know, like the,

2900
02:45:49,070 --> 02:45:52,640
the willingness to take chances and
then sometimes it doesn't work out.

2901
02:45:53,030 --> 02:45:54,580
And he said, yeah, but sometimes you know,

2902
02:45:54,620 --> 02:45:57,200
you go on the road and you don't want
to take those chances. I said, well,

2903
02:45:57,201 --> 02:46:00,560
you don't have to worry about that
because you're opening up for me. Right.

2904
02:46:00,561 --> 02:46:04,400
So like it doesn't matter if you bomb,
never, you're never going to get fired.

2905
02:46:05,090 --> 02:46:10,040
I know that you're a funny comedian.
He, as long as you're trying be when it,

2906
02:46:10,240 --> 02:46:14,480
when I wouldn't have that feeling is
when someone wasn't trying to get better.

2907
02:46:14,540 --> 02:46:15,081
Right.
And you know,

2908
02:46:15,081 --> 02:46:18,530
there are people that just get to a
certain point and they just completely

2909
02:46:18,531 --> 02:46:21,850
plateau and then they redo the same
jokes for a decade. I mean, we,

2910
02:46:21,851 --> 02:46:23,390
we all know comics that are like that.

2911
02:46:23,750 --> 02:46:26,780
I have no desire to be
around those types of people.

2912
02:46:27,050 --> 02:46:29,360
But the type of guys like
you or like all your,

2913
02:46:29,361 --> 02:46:33,500
anybody who was improving and always
working on your stand up, I was like,

2914
02:46:33,501 --> 02:46:36,590
go fuck around up there, man. If it
doesn't work out, it doesn't matter.

2915
02:46:36,920 --> 02:46:41,300
It doesn't matter. It's all
about developing. Oh Dude.
But you don't necessarily

2916
02:46:41,420 --> 02:46:44,030
tip toe around the fact.
And some of our jokes don't work.

2917
02:46:44,310 --> 02:46:45,420
Gotta be honest about that.

2918
02:46:45,421 --> 02:46:50,190
But I want you to be honest to me too
mean Eddie Bravo, uh, said to me once,

2919
02:46:50,191 --> 02:46:52,800
he goes, man, I don't like that
joke you're doing. And I said, yeah,

2920
02:46:52,801 --> 02:46:55,680
I'm kind of forcing it, right? I'm like,
yeah, thank you for telling me that.

2921
02:46:55,681 --> 02:46:57,470
Thank you.
Cause I'm fucking forced in that joke.

2922
02:46:57,570 --> 02:46:59,790
That was a joke that I would
like kept in my arsenal,

2923
02:46:59,791 --> 02:47:03,480
but I'd committed to for whatever
reason, it just wasn't good. Now though,

2924
02:47:03,500 --> 02:47:07,020
that kind of Shit helps, man. That's
it. Fuck yeah, man. You need to know.

2925
02:47:07,021 --> 02:47:09,660
You need to know when you're,
you're being repetitive.

2926
02:47:09,900 --> 02:47:12,720
You need to know when you're,
you, you overuse the word fuck.

2927
02:47:12,721 --> 02:47:16,890
And you make for an uncomfortable moment
when someone's listening to you, you're,

2928
02:47:16,920 --> 02:47:21,660
you're doing when you're on stage is
you're essentially controlling the pattern

2929
02:47:21,661 --> 02:47:23,370
of thought that goes
through someone's mind.

2930
02:47:23,370 --> 02:47:25,960
Cause you're going to bring up various
topics and various subjects that put

2931
02:47:25,980 --> 02:47:30,300
various images and feelings and people
and you have to get them to appreciate

2932
02:47:30,301 --> 02:47:31,770
where your mind is coming from.

2933
02:47:31,950 --> 02:47:35,300
Well if you add an and a bunch of extra
frogs or you're stammering or you're

2934
02:47:35,330 --> 02:47:39,370
coming off like a goof, which oftentimes
we do, especially on this podcast,

2935
02:47:39,420 --> 02:47:42,050
we got too high. Like I couldn't
remember the young Turk thing earlier.

2936
02:47:42,570 --> 02:47:44,060
So we go into a stammer mode,
you know,

2937
02:47:44,520 --> 02:47:48,810
but no one wants to listen to that and
then allow you to continue controlling

2938
02:47:48,811 --> 02:47:51,630
the pattern of thought.
That's why it's an uncomfortable moment.

2939
02:47:51,840 --> 02:47:55,770
That uncomfortable moment is the
realization that you at that moment you

2940
02:47:55,771 --> 02:47:57,930
shouldn't be in control.
And unfortunately you are.

2941
02:47:58,140 --> 02:47:59,310
Cause there's only two people in the room.

2942
02:47:59,650 --> 02:48:01,890
Regardless of the fact that half a million
people are going to listen to those.

2943
02:48:02,070 --> 02:48:03,150
There's only two people in the room,

2944
02:48:03,690 --> 02:48:04,261
two people.

2945
02:48:04,261 --> 02:48:07,320
Sometimes I've gotten on stage and fucking
forgotten what's about to come out of

2946
02:48:07,321 --> 02:48:07,681
my mouth.

2947
02:48:07,681 --> 02:48:10,620
That's the worst thing where you're like
in the middle of something and that's

2948
02:48:10,621 --> 02:48:14,550
happened to me a couple of times where
I'm like too high and I'm like Shit,

2949
02:48:15,630 --> 02:48:17,680
do this joke and we gotta be careful.

2950
02:48:17,890 --> 02:48:20,830
You know one sucks when you do more
than one show in a night. Yeah.

2951
02:48:20,831 --> 02:48:22,060
And then you get rid of like confused.

2952
02:48:22,310 --> 02:48:24,500
Well because when you
do more than one show,

2953
02:48:24,501 --> 02:48:28,240
what happens is there's a state
of mind when you're on stage,

2954
02:48:28,241 --> 02:48:29,440
which is like let's,

2955
02:48:29,441 --> 02:48:33,910
let's just consider it getting
on the trolley and sitting
in the same seat. Okay.

2956
02:48:33,911 --> 02:48:35,650
You get on the trial,
you were in that same seat.

2957
02:48:35,860 --> 02:48:38,320
That is the state of mind that
you at when you're on stage.

2958
02:48:38,321 --> 02:48:42,380
Like I'm in this driver's seat and
here we go. I'm on the trolley. Yeah.

2959
02:48:42,460 --> 02:48:45,910
Well when you're on the trolley
again for the second show,

2960
02:48:46,060 --> 02:48:49,690
and especially if you do it like I do it
where I don't really have necessarily a

2961
02:48:49,691 --> 02:48:52,810
particular order. I think I have an
idea probably how I'm going to close,

2962
02:48:53,080 --> 02:48:55,780
but I don't know how the fuck I'm going
to open and I might go from here to

2963
02:48:55,781 --> 02:48:57,340
there and I might jump all over the place.

2964
02:48:57,490 --> 02:49:01,060
And when I do that then I can get lost
and say, I don't remember if I did it.

2965
02:49:01,350 --> 02:49:05,930
Alrighty dude. It's um, yeah, it's
really easy to lose your focus up there,

2966
02:49:05,931 --> 02:49:08,010
but thank God it doesn't
have all the time. You know,

2967
02:49:08,010 --> 02:49:11,460
I just realized this too, man thing a
problem. I've got to fucking piss dude.

2968
02:49:12,350 --> 02:49:15,360
Why don't we go pistols ramp this up.
I can talking for two hours.

2969
02:49:15,370 --> 02:49:18,180
You wrap it up now. 50 minutes.
Yeah, let's wrap it up now.

2970
02:49:18,330 --> 02:49:21,720
So I think to wrap up the,
the Brian thing, you know,

2971
02:49:21,721 --> 02:49:24,210
I think we all learned a little
something from this and I think, yeah,

2972
02:49:24,390 --> 02:49:29,390
online feuds and just spats and
all that stuff is just bitch shit.

2973
02:49:29,870 --> 02:49:34,090
You know, what are the bridge?
It's gross. Dun, Dun, Dun.

2974
02:49:34,730 --> 02:49:39,730
I don't have to have a city of limitation
to lift yourself above this life.

2975
02:49:39,990 --> 02:49:44,250
When to get you back in the isolation
tank to plug the fuck out of it.

2976
02:49:44,260 --> 02:49:47,990
Sun doing pre sales for the
first time ever in my life.
He's a comedian. I'm like,

2977
02:49:47,991 --> 02:49:50,070
goodness,
tee shirts.

2978
02:49:50,071 --> 02:49:54,780
We're going presales for tee
shirts@theshopatduncantrostle.com
they're awesome.

2979
02:49:54,930 --> 02:49:58,660
It's one of them is a pyramid.
Killing a fucking vampire bat.

2980
02:49:59,280 --> 02:50:02,790
If they order appreciate. How long
was it before the, it's the shirt.

2981
02:50:02,791 --> 02:50:07,230
Watch the ship and I put the order and
on the 15th so then how long will it be

2982
02:50:07,240 --> 02:50:10,020
til they actually get it? It's on the
side. I think it'll be a couple of weeks.

2983
02:50:10,110 --> 02:50:12,150
Couple of weeks. He can handle
a couple of weeks. Folks,

2984
02:50:12,151 --> 02:50:15,240
give something to look forward to.
If you get them out,

2985
02:50:15,241 --> 02:50:19,920
it's 20 bucks and if you wait, it
said $2 extra and you can't. Duncan,

2986
02:50:19,950 --> 02:50:22,950
you're crazy. You're a marketing
genius. How I tell you dude, my penalty,

2987
02:50:23,100 --> 02:50:25,920
my web guy,
he came up with that sounds like a creep.

2988
02:50:28,750 --> 02:50:33,540
Gimmicky mother fucker. Just kidding. I
can't help myself. The greatest stuff,

2989
02:50:33,940 --> 02:50:35,770
Steve, I don't even know you
and I love you, but you, I mean,

2990
02:50:35,950 --> 02:50:40,900
you really establish that we are,
we doing more podcasts this week.

2991
02:50:40,901 --> 02:50:43,480
I'm not sure who I'm working out
the next couple of ones this week,

2992
02:50:43,481 --> 02:50:45,250
but a more red Ban as well.
Don't worry,

2993
02:50:45,540 --> 02:50:49,150
we'll bring my little buddy back
into the mix. Um, and so, uh,

2994
02:50:49,151 --> 02:50:51,460
I want to thank everybody that
came to New York this past weekend.

2995
02:50:51,461 --> 02:50:55,450
We had the fucking time of our lives
mean can you can't get better than that.

2996
02:50:55,600 --> 02:50:59,980
I played it yesterday. I played the
audio of Joey Diaz going on stage.

2997
02:51:01,600 --> 02:51:05,740
Oh my God. I'll pull it up again
just because it's so ridiculous.

2998
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,770
It doesn't good. And you'd
go Piss, I'll play this

2999
02:51:10,480 --> 02:51:14,380
because I played it from Mrs Rogan
and she almost didn't believe it.

3000
02:51:15,730 --> 02:51:17,770
It doesn't really doesn't seem real.

3001
02:51:18,730 --> 02:51:22,060
This is a Joey Coco Diaz
going on stage in New York.

3002
02:51:22,180 --> 02:51:27,180
[inaudible]

3003
02:51:36,890 --> 02:51:38,720
he hasn't even had a
chance to say a word yet.

3004
02:51:50,170 --> 02:51:53,710
He had to stop them. It
was just crazy. It was, um,

3005
02:51:53,990 --> 02:51:58,920
it really represent to all of
us. Uh, some, some sort of a,

3006
02:51:58,921 --> 02:52:03,490
a real obvious paradigm shift and uh,
you know,

3007
02:52:03,491 --> 02:52:08,230
I can speak for every of us, for
Joey, for Ari, for Dunkin, you know,

3008
02:52:08,231 --> 02:52:11,710
we're very, very thankful that
all this is happening. And uh,

3009
02:52:11,800 --> 02:52:15,990
for me personally as a a guy
who, uh, you know, I had,

3010
02:52:16,090 --> 02:52:19,420
but I was the one who was on television
and I was the one who was taking these

3011
02:52:19,421 --> 02:52:24,421
guys on the road with me to see guys like
Joey all the sudden become recognized

3012
02:52:25,900 --> 02:52:29,080
and people appreciate him for what he is.
Joey,

3013
02:52:29,180 --> 02:52:32,770
it's always had a hard time with people
recognizing his brilliance because he's

3014
02:52:33,010 --> 02:52:38,010
so crazy and out there and wild with
his comedy that until he was famous,

3015
02:52:38,591 --> 02:52:41,650
until he was like an established
personality like he has now,

3016
02:52:41,890 --> 02:52:46,890
it's almost like it's too hot to handle
is too much to deal with people nobody

3017
02:52:47,081 --> 02:52:50,340
wanted to have in middle. That was
like a big deal with, with Joey Diaz.

3018
02:52:50,350 --> 02:52:53,080
Like he couldn't get work on the
road because he couldn't headline,

3019
02:52:53,320 --> 02:52:57,070
but he couldn't middle because nobody
wanted Joey Diaz on in front of them

3020
02:52:57,080 --> 02:52:59,980
because he would just go
up and fucking destroy.

3021
02:53:00,460 --> 02:53:05,460
But my philosophy of comedy came
out at the comedy store and uh,

3022
02:53:05,500 --> 02:53:09,190
first of all what that meant was that we
were all brothers in the comedy store.

3023
02:53:09,340 --> 02:53:11,280
So it was like if I was going to
take anybody in the road of me,

3024
02:53:11,320 --> 02:53:15,280
I take my comedy store brothers who was
always Ari Shaffir was always Duncan

3025
02:53:15,280 --> 02:53:18,430
Trussell. It was, uh, you know,
different people. See I'm Tripoli,

3026
02:53:18,431 --> 02:53:22,930
different people that are comedy store
brothers and Joey was always a comedy

3027
02:53:22,931 --> 02:53:25,630
store brother. And so when I started
taking them on the road with me,

3028
02:53:25,631 --> 02:53:30,100
there was two reasons. One that cause
he was a comedy store brother and two,

3029
02:53:30,101 --> 02:53:34,330
because the, the philosophy of the
comedy store also was you had to go,

3030
02:53:34,710 --> 02:53:36,790
he wanted to go on with
a bunch of other killers.

3031
02:53:36,820 --> 02:53:39,900
You didn't want to be the only
guy that was good. You wanted to.

3032
02:53:39,940 --> 02:53:43,990
The comedy store was a about a
bunch of different guys being good,

3033
02:53:44,290 --> 02:53:46,630
like the old outlaws of comedy,
you know,

3034
02:53:46,631 --> 02:53:49,990
with called the bow and Tennyson and
like there's a bunch of guys that were

3035
02:53:49,991 --> 02:53:51,430
really good Ron shock.

3036
02:53:51,690 --> 02:53:55,210
There was a bunch of these dudes that
were really good together and that,

3037
02:53:55,960 --> 02:53:56,141
you know,

3038
02:53:56,141 --> 02:54:00,880
so so t taking guys like Joey on the
road and exposing him to all these people

3039
02:54:00,881 --> 02:54:05,140
and then seeing them go on stage and
these fucking gigantic rounds of applause

3040
02:54:05,141 --> 02:54:09,880
he gets. It's beautiful. I couldn't be
happier. It's amazing to me. It's like,

3041
02:54:09,881 --> 02:54:12,790
um, it's like a vision
that's sort of coming true.

3042
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,320
We have this idea when we
used to do these, you know,

3043
02:54:15,370 --> 02:54:18,280
when we were calling ourselves a death
squad, we used to do these little videos.

3044
02:54:18,290 --> 02:54:21,430
I hired Brian do these death
squad videos and there was,

3045
02:54:21,431 --> 02:54:22,450
some of them were really short.

3046
02:54:22,451 --> 02:54:26,170
Like one of them was Joey Diaz talking
about Mcginn this gay guy and the gay guy

3047
02:54:26,171 --> 02:54:28,140
beat him up. I mean there's
a, there's a bunch of all,

3048
02:54:28,141 --> 02:54:31,180
I'll probably get Brian to try
to find them on, organize them.

3049
02:54:31,181 --> 02:54:33,460
And put them online because some
of them were really classic,

3050
02:54:33,790 --> 02:54:38,140
but the idea didn't really come to
fruition in the terms of doing it through

3051
02:54:38,141 --> 02:54:39,370
these little video clips.

3052
02:54:39,400 --> 02:54:43,330
The real way to get to know a guy like
Joey is to get to know him on the podcast.

3053
02:54:43,331 --> 02:54:46,660
If you him go off for hours and
hours about criminal stories,

3054
02:54:46,661 --> 02:54:50,620
about sneaking to some girls fucking
bedroom at two o'clock in the morning and

3055
02:54:50,621 --> 02:54:52,590
ain't no pussy and then
escaping and the that.

3056
02:54:52,640 --> 02:54:54,310
This is the crazy shit that he did.

3057
02:54:54,540 --> 02:54:59,540
You know the Lucy snore Bush story has
become so big that a guy at in Atlanta,

3058
02:54:59,561 --> 02:55:03,470
did you see the stickers
that he made? He had, hello,

3059
02:55:03,471 --> 02:55:07,340
my name is Lucy Snore, Bush
teaching two stickers. There were,

3060
02:55:07,360 --> 02:55:08,630
there were amazing man.

3061
02:55:08,840 --> 02:55:12,890
It just to see that happening and
to see it all come out of this,

3062
02:55:12,891 --> 02:55:15,800
this one idea that you know,
that man,

3063
02:55:15,830 --> 02:55:19,370
I get this really talented group of
friends and I think that if we all stick

3064
02:55:19,371 --> 02:55:22,850
together and sort of, you know, help
each other out and pump each other up,

3065
02:55:22,851 --> 02:55:24,380
we make each other better and we,

3066
02:55:24,420 --> 02:55:29,420
we make each other funny era and we
create like a bigger footprint of positive

3067
02:55:29,751 --> 02:55:34,460
energy. All of us together have one
giant footprint of positive energy,

3068
02:55:34,520 --> 02:55:36,020
but it has to be only back.

3069
02:55:36,530 --> 02:55:40,620
And that's why it was very important
to resolve this whole issue with, uh,

3070
02:55:40,670 --> 02:55:43,720
with you and Brian. And you
know, as I said, it's not as,

3071
02:55:43,910 --> 02:55:48,910
it's not a clear cut case of either one
person having done the right thing and

3072
02:55:49,581 --> 02:55:51,470
there's errors made on both sides,

3073
02:55:51,500 --> 02:55:56,450
both in the actual act itself and in
the discussion of the act afterwards.

3074
02:55:56,450 --> 02:55:59,780
There's, there's some incorrect thinking
and it's a negative thinking going on,

3075
02:56:00,080 --> 02:56:04,640
but hopefully we'll work all that shit
out. The most important thing is we're a,

3076
02:56:05,180 --> 02:56:07,910
all of us in this fucking thing together.

3077
02:56:08,180 --> 02:56:13,180
And the last negative bullshit that you
can spread the law of forgiveness that

3078
02:56:14,061 --> 02:56:18,170
you can give the more you can call
people up and go, I'm fucking sorry,

3079
02:56:18,171 --> 02:56:21,540
I'm really sorry in. The more the person
listening you can go, it's all I do.

3080
02:56:21,570 --> 02:56:24,320
It's all good dude.
The more we can do that in this life,

3081
02:56:24,720 --> 02:56:29,330
the more we realize that we're
all capable in various situations,

3082
02:56:30,020 --> 02:56:32,750
various circumstances of
making colossal mistakes.

3083
02:56:33,110 --> 02:56:35,120
It doesn't necessarily mean
you're a horrible person.

3084
02:56:35,150 --> 02:56:37,760
It just means sometimes we
don't respond well to stress.

3085
02:56:37,910 --> 02:56:41,810
Sometimes we don't respond
well to character issues
and we need to learn and we

3086
02:56:41,811 --> 02:56:46,010
need to grow and he may be
more appropriate than I am.
You may be further ahead,

3087
02:56:46,220 --> 02:56:50,180
but show me, show me, show
me how you got there. Don't,

3088
02:56:50,210 --> 02:56:54,650
don't chastise, don't be angry
and don't hate child elevate.

3089
02:56:54,680 --> 02:56:59,120
We can all make this. We're not going
to make utopia. It doesn't exist,

3090
02:56:59,510 --> 02:57:02,720
but we can all make our environment and
the people we come in contact with a

3091
02:57:02,721 --> 02:57:07,010
little bit better and then my, when
recording, we'll stop in three minutes.

3092
02:57:07,011 --> 02:57:11,000
I just got a warning from Ustream.
Listen power to the people.

3093
02:57:11,330 --> 02:57:14,870
I love all your dirty bitches. We
do. And uh, we'll be back soon.

3094
02:57:14,900 --> 02:57:17,510
