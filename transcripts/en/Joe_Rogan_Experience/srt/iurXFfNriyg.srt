1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,580
Four,
three.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,740
Welcome back man.
Hey,

3
00:00:10,741 --> 00:00:11,730
thank you.
Good to be here.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,020
Great to see you again.
Yeah,

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,400
I like your new spot.
Thank you.

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,120
Thank you very much.
Ma'Am.

7
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:18,750
You have a real flip phone.
I do have a real foot said that you.

8
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,630
You didn't go back to it.
You've never left.

9
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:24,330
I never left her.
So you never went like iphone,

10
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:25,490
android?
Never.

11
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,310
No.
Never,

12
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:28,530
never even thought about it.
Never even thought about it.

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,230
No.
You see people taking pictures and using

14
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,100
apps?
Nothing.

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,010
Nothing.
Uh,

16
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,400
I,
I,

17
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,920
I don't need the APP so I'm good.
There's no draw at all.

18
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:40,380
Nothing that using the internet to 
answering email.

19
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,700
I have a laptop,
I have a laptop at home and I do access 

20
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,790
the Internet,
but when you're out you don't want to 

21
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,740
mess with it.
No one of them out.

22
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:51,240
I want to be out in the world.

23
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,750
You know,
if you're,

24
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,450
if you're looking at your phone,
you're not in the world.

25
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:56,520
And so you don't get either.
You don't get either thing.

26
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,410
He would get along very well.
My friend Ari,

27
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,810
he went back to a flip phone and he 
looks disdainfully sort of like a former

28
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:06,360
alcoholics look it at everybody with a 
drink.

29
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:08,920
Like there's no way you could just enjoy
one drink you loser,

30
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,070
right?
Yeah.

31
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:11,550
No,
I,

32
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,180
I,
um,

33
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,440
I just look around at this.
I mean I'm an anthropologist and I am 

34
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,050
interested in human behavior and I look 
at the behavior like literally the 

35
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,030
physical behavior of people with,
with smartphones and it doesn't,

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,950
it looks I'm antisocial and unhappy and 
anxious and I don't want to be.

37
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:31,080
I don't want to look like that and I 
don't want to feel like.

38
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,240
I think those people feel,
wow,

39
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:33,840
that's deep.

40
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,580
I'm a junkie,
you know?

41
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:37,000
Uh,
it's really interesting because,

42
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:42,001
uh,
I was at a restaurant the other day and 

43
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,761
I was looking around and literally 
everyone in the restaurant was looking 

44
00:01:43,761 --> 00:01:43,761
at their phone.
No one was talking to,

45
00:01:43,761 --> 00:01:44,730
to anybody.
And I was thinking,

46
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:49,731
what if there was a drug that did that?
What if there was a drug that didn't 

47
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:53,241
kill you,
but it just sucked up all your time and 

48
00:01:53,241 --> 00:01:56,011
you just stared blankly at your hand.
And did everything that you do while 

49
00:01:56,011 --> 00:01:56,910
you're using a phone,
people would be terrified,

50
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:59,280
like you're staring at your hand and 
crashed into cars.

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,860
You're staring at your hand and walking 
into Poles.

52
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:02,700
Yeah,
I mean,

53
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,310
I mean there is a drug.
It's that social media.

54
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:07,860
I mean,
I think the big lie of our generation is

55
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,780
the phrase social media.
It really isn't.

56
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:13,440
It's antisocial media and it has a lot 
of uses and know whatever.

57
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,090
But it's not social in any human sense.
And,

58
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:19,920
and if you look at suicide rates,
depression rates,

59
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:22,410
ptsd rates,
anxiety rates,

60
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,530
they're doing nothing but going up in 
our society,

61
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,800
mass shootings,
you know,

62
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,940
just something tragic just happened 
yesterday.

63
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,450
I'm all those things.
There are indicators of something and 

64
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,731
they're all going up in our society 
despite the fact that we're a very 

65
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:37,731
wealthy,
powerful,

66
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:39,480
relatively peaceful society.
Like something's going on.

67
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:41,370
I can't prove that it's,
you know,

68
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,340
the internet or social media,
what I mean obviously,

69
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:49,450
but,
but the fact that those things are 

70
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,591
happening at the same time does make me 
wonder that these new devices certainly 

71
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:56,841
don't bring happiness because the 
numbers are going in the wrong 

72
00:02:56,841 --> 00:02:56,841
direction.
Well,

73
00:02:56,841 --> 00:02:56,841
I don't think they're designed to bring 
happiness,

74
00:02:56,841 --> 00:02:59,890
but there's certainly designed to give 
you access to information go perhaps,

75
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:00,130
maybe

76
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,330
with some discipline they can be used in
some sort of a way that that benefit

77
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,450
not.
Well,

78
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:10,451
yeah.
I mean all of that information is 

79
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:10,451
available in your laptop at your desk at
home.

80
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:14,960
I think the problem is when,
when people want to be socially,

81
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,800
socially connected constantly,
no matter what they're doing and that I 

82
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:26,081
think keeps people from actually fully 
experiencing whatever they're actually 

83
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:26,990
doing.
I think there's definitely some truth to

84
00:03:26,991 --> 00:03:29,390
that,
but I do like the fact that I can ask my

85
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,400
phone questions like if I don't know 
anything and I can add a new feature on 

86
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,801
this Google Pixel,
we squeezed the side of it and the 

87
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,500
Google assistant comes up and you can 
ask it questions.

88
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:41,030
You squeeze it and ask a question.
I mean,

89
00:03:41,031 --> 00:03:43,310
that's some space age shit,
man,

90
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,510
or it's downright creepy.
I mean,

91
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,860
you look at it,
I mean,

92
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,440
I,
you know,

93
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,250
I get it.
I mean,

94
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,220
you have all of human knowledge in your 
front pocket.

95
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,530
Yeah.
Accessible at every moment.

96
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,680
Like I do understand the power of it and
the appeal of it.

97
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,380
I'm not saying there aren't great things
about.

98
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,680
Of course there are.
Um,

99
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:05,090
it's just,
for me the downside outweighs the upside

100
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,440
for other people.
I guess it doesn't.

101
00:04:06,441 --> 00:04:11,441
But if you look again,
if you look at mental health statistics 

102
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:14,321
in this country,
we're doing something wrong because 

103
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:14,321
they're all going in the wrong 
direction.

104
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:18,370
I agree with you.
I just wonder if the mental health 

105
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:18,890
statistics are indicative of other 
issues.

106
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,510
You know,
I think lifestyle,

107
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,880
what you do with your time during the 
day,

108
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:28,980
and I know a lot of people live a very 
deeply unsatisfying lives and I don't 

109
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,230
know if the phone accentuates that 
problem.

110
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,230
I mean we were talking the other day 
about we were at the airport,

111
00:04:34,231 --> 00:04:38,010
we're waiting to fly home and there was 
some girl and she was talking,

112
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:43,011
we were just ease dropping and she was 
talking about like the amazing race and 

113
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:43,970
how she,
you know,

114
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,740
this show so boring now and I can't wait
to,

115
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,670
I'm going to eat this and then I'm going
to eat that and I,

116
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,740
I'm supposed to get a raise at work.
It's like all nonsense,

117
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,770
non engaging,
not interesting.

118
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,320
There's no real life to anything she's 
talking about.

119
00:04:58,321 --> 00:05:01,080
And like this is most of our country or

120
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,030
a large part of our country.
Oh absolutely.

121
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:07,660
I mean the thing about social media is 
that it sort of weaponizes blend this,

122
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,580
it allows,
it gives people a platform for the most 

123
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,320
mundane,
uninteresting aspects of their lives 

124
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,071
because they have to constantly,
constantly be producing some kind of 

125
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:22,870
output of communication.
Well and if not,

126
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,120
producing it certainly absorbing it all 
right.

127
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:26,350
Yeah.
We were both feeling good

128
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,090
mining when I'm on twitter,
like nothin,

129
00:05:29,091 --> 00:05:30,500
nothin,
nothin,

130
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:31,190
nothin.

131
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,740
Oh right.
Oh murder.

132
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,800
Oh look at this little monkey found.
Oh,

133
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,780
I mean there,
no,

134
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,020
I mean there's other people you could 
have on the show that could speak more 

135
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,020
intelligently to this,
but I know that,

136
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,980
I mean,
I've heard that um,

137
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,130
risk of suicide and face facebook are 
correlated.

138
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,220
In other words,
people that are are on facebook and in 

139
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,951
social media,
they are at an increased risk of 

140
00:05:56,951 --> 00:05:57,740
depression and thoughts of suicide and 
that and that.

141
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,070
That's

142
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:03,070
terrifying.
Do you think that that's correlation 

143
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,070
equals causation though?
You know what I mean?

144
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,070
Like,
do you think that people on facebook all

145
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:05,960
the time are doing that because they're 
already depressed?

146
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,090
Right?
I mean,

147
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,660
that's the question and what the 
correlation means.

148
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,280
We have to look at something more 
closely.

149
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:17,340
Yeah.
Anxiety rates and teenagers have 

150
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:17,340
skyrocketed.
Um,

151
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,450
anxiety partly comes from a sort of a 
painful self awareness.

152
00:06:19,451 --> 00:06:24,451
And of course that's amplified by social
media because you can never escape the 

153
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:24,451
opinions of your peers.
I mean,

154
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:25,390
that's crippling to people.
I mean,

155
00:06:25,391 --> 00:06:26,320
we're not,
you know,

156
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:28,660
I wasn't the most popular kid in class 
by a long shot.

157
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:29,710
And when,
when I came home,

158
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:33,010
whatever my whatever my issues were,
were on hold until,

159
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,690
you know,
when I was a kid in high school,

160
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,420
there was issues around hold till 8:00
AM the next morning.

161
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:42,421
Right.
You got a 12 hour break from your 

162
00:06:42,421 --> 00:06:42,421
problems,
now you don't.

163
00:06:42,421 --> 00:06:42,421
And it's really tough on kids.

164
00:06:42,421 --> 00:06:44,670
Yeah.
I can only imagine growing up today,

165
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:45,700
I,
you know,

166
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,800
I think we got very lucky that the,
we experienced the Internet in 

167
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:50,800
adulthood,
you know,

168
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:51,790
for me,
I was,

169
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:57,420
think I was 27 the first time I ever 
gone online and that's a nice,

170
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:02,540
you know,
and no one knew what online was back 

171
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:02,540
then.
You weren't leaving any traces,

172
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:02,730
you were just going out and looking at 
stuff.

173
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,070
Yeah,

174
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,160
that's right.
That's right.

175
00:07:05,161 --> 00:07:05,700
Yeah.
I was.

176
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,330
How old was I?
I was about 36.

177
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,250
I remember.
I remember a girl asked me,

178
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,920
do you ever logged on?
And I say,

179
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,290
well,
Donald,

180
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,340
what?
She had to explain to me what that 

181
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:19,340
meant.
And then I literally said to all,

182
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,640
that's never going to catch on.
Come on.

183
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,380
That's like a really.
Yeah.

184
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,680
Wow.
Yeah,

185
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,740
isn't that what they said about the 
first computers,

186
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,120
like that was one of IBM's a initial 
reactions to the idea of the personal 

187
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,660
computer?
I think that's the reaction to the first

188
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,030
of everything except maybe the bow and 
arrow.

189
00:07:36,031 --> 00:07:37,740
I mean like when they invented the bone 
Arrow,

190
00:07:37,741 --> 00:07:38,330
everyone was like,
no,

191
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,230
that is going to catch on.
That is cool.

192
00:07:40,231 --> 00:07:41,160
Right?
But everything else,

193
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,380
I think that's

194
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,840
skepticism.
Like we don't,

195
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,370
we don't need anything more.
We're good.

196
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:50,460
And then you realize,
I mean that's the amazing thing about 

197
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,921
the human mind is that we invent this 
stuff and it doesn't mean that it's 

198
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:57,121
good.
I mean we evolved over hundreds of 

199
00:07:57,121 --> 00:07:57,121
thousands of years to live a very 
different environment that we live now.

200
00:07:57,121 --> 00:08:02,040
So these things that we invent,
it doesn't mean that they're sort of 

201
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,250
psychologically good for us,
but they definitely are incredible.

202
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,840
I mean there are definitely amazing 
things.

203
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:10,190
Yeah.
I don't think that necessarily they're 

204
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,901
good for us,
but I don't think this is kind of sound 

205
00:08:11,901 --> 00:08:15,081
weird,
but I don't even think they're 

206
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:15,081
necessarily designed for us.
I think they're designed for the future,

207
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:16,620
I think,
and I don't even think it's a design.

208
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:21,650
I just think that all things move in an 
ever more complex direction and whatever

209
00:08:21,691 --> 00:08:26,691
a person is now is not going to be the 
same thing a thousand years from now or 

210
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:27,450
100 years from now even.
I think there's going to be some sort of

211
00:08:27,451 --> 00:08:32,451
symbiotic can actually train us in 
electronics like we're going to have it 

212
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:32,940
installed in our body.

213
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:38,580
Well that gets to a kind of profound 
question like what is the point of 

214
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,750
existence of human existence?
What's the point of it?

215
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,860
Is the point for as many humans as 
possible to leafs to lead safe human 

216
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,000
fulfilled lives?
Or is it for the human race as an entity

217
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,800
to produce the highest technological 
achievements and insights,

218
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:56,240
you know?
And,

219
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,010
and I don't have a vote either way,
um,

220
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:03,020
but that it does sort of seem to be the 
question and that technology.

221
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,160
I mean,
we know does not lead to fulfillment and

222
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:06,660
happiness,
but it does lead design,

223
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:08,040
topic,
insight and to,

224
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,510
you know,
incredible.

225
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:14,590
Um,
under profound understanding of how the 

226
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:14,590
universe works in a physical sense.

227
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:19,550
Yeah.
I wonder if what we're doing is just 

228
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,951
being caught up in the momentum of all 
this innovation and instead of like low 

229
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:27,590
using discipline or using some sort of a
rational objective analysis of what it 

230
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:33,030
takes to be happy and then maybe 
pushing,

231
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,120
pushing some of that stuff aside and 
engaging and actually physical 

232
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,181
activities,
going out and doing things and making 

233
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:41,181
that almost like a prescription.
Like,

234
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:41,250
Hey,
you know,

235
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,990
look,
let's look at your daily chart.

236
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:44,460
Hey,
you don't even get enough vitamins,

237
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:45,450
buddy.
Hey,

238
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,120
you didn't get enough activity like you 
need.

239
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,520
You need that in order to be in order to
feel right,

240
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,470
to feel,
feel balanced.

241
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:57,660
Right.
And it feeling right is the point of 

242
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,671
existence.
Then iphone are probably not a good 

243
00:09:59,671 --> 00:09:59,671
development.
No.

244
00:09:59,671 --> 00:10:04,080
If the exchange of data,
if the exchange of information is the 

245
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,690
point,
then,

246
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:09,691
then they're a great innovation.
So it really depends on what we're all 

247
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:12,061
here for.
I W I was in San Francisco with my wife 

248
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:14,821
and I were walking behind these two kids
who were talking about about robots and 

249
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:19,321
one was they were sort of kids that were
sort of sort of in the know about all 

250
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:19,600
this stuff and one guy was saying,
you know,

251
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:20,470
they're taking over,
you know,

252
00:10:20,471 --> 00:10:21,880
in 50 years,
you know,

253
00:10:21,881 --> 00:10:22,360
we're,
we're,

254
00:10:22,361 --> 00:10:27,361
we're going to be,
humans are going to be completely 

255
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:27,361
unnecessary,
but I said to my wife,

256
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:29,050
you know,
we always were unnecessary,

257
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,720
like none of this had to happen.
It's not like the world needs.

258
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:34,240
Human beings do exist and for some 
purpose,

259
00:10:34,241 --> 00:10:34,820
right?
We just,

260
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,020
we are here,
but we didn't have to be here.

261
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,320
And so if robots replace us,
we go right back to where we would have 

262
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,550
been if we hadn't.
If we hadn't evolved.

263
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:51,220
And it was,
it was just a funny way of thinking 

264
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:51,220
about it.
Like none of this is actually necessary.

265
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:51,220
It doesn't have to be happening.

266
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,290
No,
it certainly doesn't.

267
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:52,770
I mean,
look,

268
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:55,800
if we are finite life forms,
if you're only going to be lived to be,

269
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:01,190
if you're lucky,
90 years and when your health is going 

270
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,530
to fail and you're going to die,
what was the,

271
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:05,790
what should be our goal is to feel good,
right?

272
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,730
To have community in relation.
That's a big part of that book.

273
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:09,470
Tribe.
Your,

274
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,380
your book's fantastic by the way.
I've read it twice and I read it again.

275
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,980
I read it before.
Then I read it again since,

276
00:11:15,981 --> 00:11:17,880
uh,
since our first podcast.

277
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,150
You very much.
Yeah,

278
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:24,290
I've been getting a lot of.
I keep getting a lot of good responses 

279
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:24,290
to it.
And,

280
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:24,290
and I think partly,
I mean,

281
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:29,191
whether you're a Democrat or Republican,
this was a pretty unsettling time in 

282
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:29,191
this country.
And um,

283
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:34,260
and I,
I think people are coming to the book a 

284
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,031
little bit just partly because they're 
wondering what is the glue that holds us

285
00:11:36,191 --> 00:11:38,680
all together and is there,
it exists still.

286
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:39,280
Like,
I mean,

287
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:44,281
I think there's a real question in 
people's minds about what is it that 

288
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:44,281
binds us together?

289
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:44,281
Well,
there certainly is.

290
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:48,831
And you really covered a lot of the sort
of just not commonly discussed aspects 

291
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:55,060
of it,
like the need for real community,

292
00:11:55,061 --> 00:12:00,061
the need to really,
and the need to have something on the 

293
00:12:00,061 --> 00:12:05,041
line now,
the need to be in situations where 

294
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:08,050
there's real consequences and that it 
seems that this is part of the glue that

295
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:08,800
holds us together.

296
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,390
I mean,
the thing about technology is it buffers

297
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,790
us from real consequences in the 
physical world,

298
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,430
which is what's great about it,
right?

299
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,100
And uh,
but the downside is that as you,

300
00:12:19,101 --> 00:12:21,680
as humans get buffered from consequences
they need,

301
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,170
they need each other less and less in 
order to survive.

302
00:12:24,171 --> 00:12:29,171
So now it's sort of modern modern homo 
sapiens in a suburban house with an 

303
00:12:29,171 --> 00:12:30,260
iphone and a garage door opener and all 
that stuff.

304
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,480
You know,
you get a paycheck at work and you don't

305
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,110
need your neighbors,
you know,

306
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,450
to,
to get help.

307
00:12:35,451 --> 00:12:38,480
You gather food or hunt food or defend 
yourself from the gang,

308
00:12:38,481 --> 00:12:39,740
from the other neighborhood.
I mean,

309
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:45,280
it all kind of gets taken care of,
which is a great liberation from your 

310
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:45,620
neighbors,
from your community.

311
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:51,070
But it deprives you of that essential 
human reliance on other people around 

312
00:12:52,281 --> 00:12:57,281
you.
That's what makes people feel good and 

313
00:12:57,281 --> 00:12:57,281
safe and like they're leading meaningful
lives.

314
00:12:57,281 --> 00:13:01,391
And so that transition to having a life 
that's not part of any community,

315
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,660
um,
that is a really tough one for people.

316
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:10,661
And I think that's part of the reason 
for high depression rates and such in 

317
00:13:10,661 --> 00:13:11,090
high ptsd rates in our society.

318
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,740
Yeah.
I think that lack of community is a very

319
00:13:13,741 --> 00:13:18,741
confusing thing when you see most people
just sliding into their garage and 

320
00:13:18,741 --> 00:13:22,371
shutting the door,
going into their house and they don't 

321
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:24,501
even know their neighbors.
How that's really highlighted in your 

322
00:13:24,501 --> 00:13:27,600
book how alien that is to the human 
experience until fairly recently.

323
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:33,030
This idea of like living in these.
Like I was in New York City this past 

324
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:37,191
weekend and there's enormous apartment,
like my friend Jim was talking about 

325
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:37,440
this,
he lived,

326
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,480
Jim Norton lives in this enormous 
apartment building.

327
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:40,800
Those,
I don't know anybody there.

328
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,360
And he goes,
I live in a house,

329
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,150
a building essentially a house with a 
thousand people.

330
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,990
I don't know any of them.

331
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,590
Yeah.
And listen,

332
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,300
I mean I live in a little tenement 
building,

333
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,950
but it's the same,
same idea.

334
00:13:50,951 --> 00:13:52,390
There's a little cubby holes we all live
in,

335
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:52,900
but I,
you know,

336
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:54,400
I got to say,
and I grew up in a suburb,

337
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:56,440
but I got to say,
at least in the building I live in,

338
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,350
I'm in the lower east side,
at least in the building I live in.

339
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,660
I run into people in the landing and the
staircase.

340
00:14:01,661 --> 00:14:04,930
There's no elevator in the staircase and
you get to know them a little bit.

341
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,470
The problem with the suburbs is that 
everything's a stone.

342
00:14:08,471 --> 00:14:10,210
You know,
everyone's a stone's throw away behind a

343
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:13,480
big hedge and you and you don't,
you don't have to share an elevator with

344
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:15,970
anyone.
You can be totally isolated.

345
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,390
And I grew up in that environment.
It was crushing and,

346
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:19,810
and I,
you know,

347
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,200
I was in a material sense,
I was lucky we were affluent family,

348
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,650
but I was not lucky in any human sets.

349
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:32,030
That's so fascinating.
He say it was crushing to live the 

350
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,030
American dream.
I mean,

351
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:36,140
a lot of people's ideas.
The American dream is living in a nice 

352
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:36,140
quiet suburb.

353
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:36,830
Yeah.
I listen to.

354
00:14:36,831 --> 00:14:38,170
There's a lot that stream,
like about it,

355
00:14:38,171 --> 00:14:39,610
but,
but um,

356
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:45,100
the,
the data will tell you that people in 

357
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,330
those situations are not happy.
I mean in,

358
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,300
by the,
the,

359
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,320
the metrics by which we measure human 
fulfillment and human happiness,

360
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,630
mental health,
they suck in the suburbs.

361
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,480
Um,
and uh,

362
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,330
and,
and,

363
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,160
and,
and generally modern society is,

364
00:14:58,161 --> 00:15:03,161
as affluence goes up in society,
the suicide rate goes up to the 

365
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:03,200
depression rate,
ptsd,

366
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,260
ptsd rate,
all that stuff goes up with,

367
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:05,740
with,
with,

368
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,440
without fluids.

369
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,860
Yeah.
I've noticed that in some of the circles

370
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:14,420
that I am hanging around with now 
because of Nice people,

371
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:19,510
but the children of my children,
my children's friends,

372
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,990
parents,
sorry,

373
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,100
I am interacting with these people that 
I don't know from work,

374
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:27,660
I don't know from social circles and 
just.

375
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,310
And most of them are great,
but a lot of them are on pills.

376
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,140
Like a lot of like,
like half of them are on pills.

377
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:35,710
Pills,
yeah.

378
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,880
Yeah.
They're,

379
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,960
they're taking the adderall and then 
taking anxiety medication and they're 

380
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,731
taking antidepressants and they're 
mixing it all together with alcohol and 

381
00:15:45,731 --> 00:15:50,080
some new freak out every week and 
there's literally no physical fear for 

382
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:54,440
anything.
Everyone's driving a Mercedes.

383
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:57,470
Everyone's living in a gated community.
Everybody's.

384
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,980
It's all smooth edges and corners.
Everything is a very soft and easy and 

385
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:10,750
the.
The big appeal seems to be the newest 

386
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,560
objects chase the newest objects.

387
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:17,930
It ends a really well known phenomenon 
that if you introduce a disaster into 

388
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,410
that environment,
if you introduced the blitz in London or

389
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:23,940
an earthquake or what have you,
have flood tidal wave of war.

390
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,070
People wake up out of their dream.
I mean they're in a kind of dream state.

391
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,670
I'm a part and for some people that's 
in,

392
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:37,700
you know,
induced by pills and some people it's 

393
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,501
just induced by isolation,
but they're in a kind of dream state 

394
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:42,051
where they're not part of society in a 
meaningful way and a catastrophe wakes 

395
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:44,340
them up out of that.
And,

396
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:49,380
and people,
I mean over and over again you can hear 

397
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:49,380
testimony of people saying,
well,

398
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,690
I really miss those days.
The days after the earthquake,

399
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,680
during the blitz,
I mean,

400
00:16:52,681 --> 00:16:57,681
you,
you from generation after generation 

401
00:16:57,681 --> 00:16:57,681
that goes through there,
there their things,

402
00:16:57,681 --> 00:17:02,271
right,
there are tough things those days are 

403
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:02,271
missed and they're missed because 
people,

404
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,220
the thing they actually like most is 
being an essential part of a small group

405
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,480
that is struggling to survive.

406
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,020
Like that is the human experience for 
hundreds of thousands of years.

407
00:17:10,021 --> 00:17:11,910
We're wired for it.
We're wired to like it.

408
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:17,420
Uh,
the people that responded to that 

409
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,101
challenge tended to pass on their DNA 
that people that didn't respond well 

410
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:22,611
didn't pass on their DNA were the 
descendants of the people that sort of 

411
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:25,590
took some thrill and from that challenge
and,

412
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:30,650
and acted well and with vigor and with 
community in the face of hardship and 

413
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,640
danger were the descendants of those 
people inevitably.

414
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,230
And uh,
uh,

415
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:37,680
because the people that didn't act well 
didn't survive is as well,

416
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,270
right?
They didn't pass on their genes.

417
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:39,840
And,
uh,

418
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,780
so that's one of the things we're 
missing in the big.

419
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,900
The big trick is,
I mean I'm not saying we're now in the 

420
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:47,900
suburbs band the car and live in a lean 
to,

421
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,610
I mean no one would say that huge to 
this society too,

422
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:55,611
but the trick is how can we have that 
close communal connection that buffers 

423
00:17:56,131 --> 00:18:01,131
us from our,
from mental health problems that makes 

424
00:18:01,131 --> 00:18:01,131
us feel meaningful and fulfilled?

425
00:18:01,131 --> 00:18:05,460
How can we have that and have the 
benefits of modern society,

426
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,330
you know,
like,

427
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,800
can we do,
can we do both?

428
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:11,970
And I think that's the big challenge 
because what I see in America,

429
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:14,760
I love this country,
but what I see in my lifetime,

430
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,340
I mean when I grew up,
we didn't have mass shootings.

431
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,660
I mean,
you know,

432
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,980
like that,
that didn't happen.

433
00:18:19,981 --> 00:18:23,040
You go into a church with a machine gun 
and kill as many people as you can.

434
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,470
Let's just didn't happen.
What is going on?

435
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:29,220
I mean to me it's a country in kind of.
I mean those things are all a symptom of

436
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,890
a country that's in the kind of psychic 
pain,

437
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,250
you know,
all the people on their iphones.

438
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:40,260
I sort of get it but it.
But also it makes me think you're 

439
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,790
anxious,
like you're so anxious that you can't 

440
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:43,790
bear not to look at your feed for more 
than 20 seconds.

441
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,760
It's an,
it's an addiction for sure.

442
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:50,850
I mean,
you're literally getting dopamine shots 

443
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,750
every time you check your feed and 
they're very small.

444
00:18:52,751 --> 00:18:54,190
It's a trickle.
It's not like a real,

445
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,550
like it's not really worth it.
You don't get any real good feeling.

446
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,450
Very rarely.

447
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,340
It's like fast food.
Like the end of the end of it,

448
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:03,080
you know,
you go to the drive in,

449
00:19:03,081 --> 00:19:03,500
you know,
get,

450
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:05,900
get your cheeseburger and fries and a 
shake or whatever.

451
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,330
Afterwards you're full,
but you,

452
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,350
you didn't get any nutrients.
And,

453
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:12,080
and social media is the same way.
You're sort of socially full.

454
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,020
But actually it's all calories that no 
nutrition.

455
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:17,870
I mean there's nothing,
nothing to sustain you.

456
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,530
Well,
I've found for me personally that people

457
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:27,480
get a lot of fulfillment out of tribes,
for lack of a better word,

458
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,720
of likeminded people doing similar 
things that are difficult.

459
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,660
Absolutely.
I see it amongst like rock climbers,

460
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:34,870
a lot of rock climbers.
They,

461
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:39,910
they find like real community in other 
rock climbers and runners get it.

462
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,310
Jujitsu.
It's huge.

463
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:43,320
And the Jiu Jitsu community horse,
you know,

464
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,850
um,
and uh,

465
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:49,851
I experienced it in a deep way.
The first time I ever went hunting 

466
00:19:49,851 --> 00:19:53,130
because hunting was almost like,
like I had a wall that I didn't know.

467
00:19:53,131 --> 00:19:55,590
There was a door on it and I opened up 
the door and oh,

468
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:58,410
there's a whole new area back here.
Like your,

469
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,500
your DNA like goes up.
We know what to do with this.

470
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,410
We're hunting now and you feel like,
wow,

471
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:09,411
this is crazy.
Like this is lighting up parts of my 

472
00:20:09,411 --> 00:20:10,770
brain or parts of my,
my genetics.

473
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,430
Yeah.
Listen,

474
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,580
I went through that same door when I 
started boxing.

475
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,200
I started late in life.
I was 50.

476
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:21,201
I go through a big life change.
My first marriage ended and I needed 

477
00:20:21,201 --> 00:20:21,270
something.
I needed something a little different.

478
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:26,540
And I think one of the things that 
really works for people is a situation 

479
00:20:27,181 --> 00:20:32,181
where they're evaluated for their 
behavior rather than for how and where 

480
00:20:33,961 --> 00:20:34,950
they were born.
Yes.

481
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,990
Right.
So or how much money they have,

482
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,310
which is a fun,
you know,

483
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:41,500
it is a function of a to some degree of 
how,

484
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,320
how you were born,
where you were born.

485
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,940
Uh,
and yeah,

486
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:45,660
but so,
you know,

487
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,350
in high school you evaluated for the 
family,

488
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:49,600
you come from,
how you look for all that stuff.

489
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,880
You don't have control over any of that 
stuff.

490
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,940
But in the boxing ring out hunting,
you know,

491
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,650
whatever,
there's a million things like this,

492
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:02,670
you're evaluated by your peers for your 
conduct and that you have complete 

493
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,670
control over soldiers the same way,
you know,

494
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:05,850
and I was with this platoon in combat 
for non,

495
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,020
for a year in eastern Afghanistan.

496
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:13,090
Those guys didn't care if you're a good 
luck with your bad looking if your dad 

497
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:13,450
was in prison or not really give a shit 
right?

498
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,530
That what they cared is how you acted in
that situation.

499
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:19,420
And would you,
would you,

500
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,600
would you put the group,
the welfare of the group ahead of your 

501
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,300
own welfare?
And that was his basic human basic human

502
00:21:25,301 --> 00:21:30,301
question.
Is the group more important to you than 

503
00:21:30,301 --> 00:21:33,121
you are to you?
And if we all answered that question 

504
00:21:33,121 --> 00:21:33,220
with a yes,
then we're good.

505
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,180
And so you know,
when you're in situations,

506
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,800
hunting in the gym,
Jujitsu,

507
00:21:38,801 --> 00:21:43,801
whatever it is,
where you're not bringing your street 

508
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:43,801
identity in there,
you're just,

509
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:48,210
you're just a human being trying to act 
as well as possible with dignity and 

510
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,030
respect for others.
You're good and it doesn't matter.

511
00:21:49,031 --> 00:21:50,770
It doesn't matter if you suck at 
Jujitsu,

512
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,040
right?
As long as you have that basic respect 

513
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,341
and hard work ethic and being freed from
those things you're not responsible for 

514
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:05,250
and so and are not judged for it.
That is a huge liberation and it really 

515
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,370
makes people feel close to each other.

516
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,290
Yeah,
so people need mom and it's also.

517
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:14,380
Do you think that a lot of what's going 
on today is just the fact that I don't 

518
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,530
think people are supposed to work in an 
office all day.

519
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,710
I think it's probably bad for your 
biology.

520
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,740
I think it's sitting in a chair all day 
is terrible for you.

521
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:24,620
I think staring at a computer all day is
terrible for you.

522
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:29,890
All these things that people do or just 
counter to their contrary to what your 

523
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:34,840
body was designed for and that must 
cause a lot of depression and anxiety in

524
00:22:35,841 --> 00:22:36,260
people.

525
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,170
Yeah,
I mean,

526
00:22:37,171 --> 00:22:39,570
if you,
if you want to know what we were evolved

527
00:22:39,571 --> 00:22:44,571
for,
you can look at current modern day 

528
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:48,321
hunter gatherers who more or less 
anthropologists agree represent our 

529
00:22:48,321 --> 00:22:51,561
evolutionary past and you'll find that 
there's at least two hours of pretty 

530
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:52,980
vigorous movement everyday.
You know,

531
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:58,010
fast walking basically two hours a day 
by virtually everyone in the community.

532
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:03,680
Um,
you are almost never out of contact 

533
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:03,680
with,
uh,

534
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,631
I mean out of physical products,
proximity with other people that you 

535
00:23:08,631 --> 00:23:11,961
know extremely well.
There's about four or five hours a day 

536
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:14,640
devoted to survival,
food gathering,

537
00:23:14,641 --> 00:23:15,900
that kind of thing.
We work eight,

538
00:23:15,901 --> 00:23:16,860
10 hours a day,
right?

539
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:22,260
The most,
quote primitive hunter gatherers and 

540
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,651
some of the harshest environments in the
world spend around four hours a day 

541
00:23:24,651 --> 00:23:26,040
surviving.
But it survival is a group endeavor.

542
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:30,630
It brings everyone together.
Everyone's needed high protein,

543
00:23:30,631 --> 00:23:33,110
low no processed foods obviously.
Um,

544
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,820
uh,
I mean,

545
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,050
the Diet,
obviously it's a very pure diet.

546
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Um,
and people who live like that have 

547
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:42,500
extraordinarily good health,
um,

548
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,860
and if they survive childbirth and those
first early years,

549
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:49,010
I'm often live into their,
into their seventies,

550
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,630
eighties to 90.
I mean,

551
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:55,790
you know,
West Bay basically live as long as 

552
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:55,790
westerners do with no medical 
intervention.

553
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,390
I mean,
it's pretty extraordinary.

554
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,460
That is externally

555
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,740
when you think about it.
I mean,

556
00:23:58,741 --> 00:24:01,800
what I saw an article and I didn't,
I didn't read the article,

557
00:24:01,801 --> 00:24:06,801
but the headline was something along the
lines of I was talking about artificial 

558
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:10,491
intelligence and it was a,
whether or not the rise of artificial 

559
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,300
intelligence will,
uh,

560
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,600
will even out inequality.
And I remember looking at that and one 

561
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,980
boy that's like giving into the hive 
mind,

562
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:24,790
like artificial intelligence is going to
cure all the woes of the world.

563
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,600
Like we'll let the computer thing for 
you and everything's going to be even.

564
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,380
And you know,
now that I'm thinking about it,

565
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,460
the two guys,
we were walking behind San Francisco,

566
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,300
it wasn't robots,
it was artificial intelligence they were

567
00:24:34,301 --> 00:24:35,920
talking about.
I mean obviously they're connected.

568
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,080
But yeah,
it was,

569
00:24:38,081 --> 00:24:40,150
it was ai and,
and um,

570
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:40,560
you know,
it's,

571
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,720
I mean it's either ai is either the 
final blossoming of the human mind or 

572
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,470
it's the end.
I don't think anyone knows which it is.

573
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:48,050
It could easily

574
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,080
be the end.
I've been thinking for the last few 

575
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,360
years that it's,
we're some sort of electronic 

576
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,000
caterpillar is giving birth to some new 
butterfly.

577
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,600
What we're doing is we're,
we're the biological thing that makes 

578
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,290
the electronic thing and that the 
electronic thing is going to go,

579
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:04,520
thanks,
we got it now.

580
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,500
And then we assume that the things that 
we hold dear,

581
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:14,000
like emotions and comradery and this 
feeling that we have community,

582
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:14,960
that that's important.

583
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:15,850
But

584
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:21,400
if we live and we die,
it's important to us while we're alive.

585
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:26,401
But what if we didn't exist?
Is it important in air quotes to the 

586
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:28,030
universe?
Is it important to the planet?

587
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,420
Not necessarily just important as a 
human

588
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:36,670
understanding of physics,
is that it was incalculably unlikely 

589
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:41,380
that the universe would exist and that 
life would start on this particular 

590
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,450
planet or on any planet.
That it was extremely unlikely that even

591
00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:49,451
the universe would exist and um,
so it's hard to say that anything would 

592
00:25:51,111 --> 00:25:55,430
be important to add to it,
to a system that,

593
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,640
that,
uh,

594
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:02,740
statistically shouldn't have happened 
and that doesn't have a conscious and 

595
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,230
moral mind behind it.
Like,

596
00:26:03,231 --> 00:26:03,680
I mean,
no,

597
00:26:03,681 --> 00:26:08,681
of course we're not important.
I mean if we were sitting on the moon 

598
00:26:08,681 --> 00:26:11,621
and you watched a nuclear exchange 
between Russia and the United States 

599
00:26:11,621 --> 00:26:13,670
that obliterated civilization,
if you were sitting on the moon,

600
00:26:13,671 --> 00:26:18,671
you'd barely be able to see it.
You would barely notice anything 

601
00:26:18,671 --> 00:26:18,671
happened.
Right?

602
00:26:18,671 --> 00:26:18,680
That's the moon.
And that's pretty close.

603
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:23,090
Of course it doesn't matter.
So keep in mind that all those emotions,

604
00:26:23,091 --> 00:26:27,940
everything we are had survival value in 
our past or we,

605
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:30,170
that we wouldn't have those things,
right?

606
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:30,650
We're,
we're,

607
00:26:30,651 --> 00:26:35,651
we're the legacy of an evolutionary 
process that went on for 2 million 

608
00:26:35,651 --> 00:26:37,400
years.
So if we feel sadness,

609
00:26:37,401 --> 00:26:39,830
if we feel anger,
if we feel shame,

610
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:42,530
all of those things had survival,
survival,

611
00:26:42,531 --> 00:26:47,531
value for humans.
And the individuals that had the 

612
00:26:47,531 --> 00:26:50,250
capacity for those emotions made better 
citizens within their little community.

613
00:26:50,251 --> 00:26:51,930
We're better hunters were better,
whatever,

614
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:56,910
and so those emotions,
we find them meaningful,

615
00:26:56,911 --> 00:27:01,911
but actually what they are is they 
helped us survive and now we have so 

616
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:07,050
altered our circumstances that survival 
is no longer a question.

617
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,660
And so what do we do with those 
feelings?

618
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:14,661
What did we do with those capacities?
The ability to hunt that the dopamine 

619
00:27:14,661 --> 00:27:16,260
that you get from hitting a target.
I mean,

620
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,980
teenage boys will sit in a basement for 
hours,

621
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,980
days,
years playing video games to practice 

622
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,991
their training for hunting right there,
turning for hunting and war and they're 

623
00:27:26,991 --> 00:27:30,081
getting rewarded with dopamine,
which is exactly what should have been 

624
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:30,081
happening for 500,000
years.

625
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,850
And now there's nothing to hunt,
nothing to fight.

626
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,780
They're still doing the behavior as they
should because they're wired for it,

627
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,340
but there's no useful purpose for it and
they're making themselves irrelevant.

628
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,090
They're human casualties of this 
technology and it's,

629
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,230
I find it really tragic.

630
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:49,110
Are they more irrelevant than someone 
who plays sports?

631
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,780
I mean,
I think our relevance comes from our,

632
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:58,870
um,
our relationship with our community and 

633
00:27:58,870 --> 00:27:58,870
our society.
And I mean,

634
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,710
at least if you play sports,
you're part of,

635
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:04,170
you're part of the human community.
And,

636
00:28:04,171 --> 00:28:09,171
and when you're in,
when you're playing a video game by 

637
00:28:09,171 --> 00:28:09,171
yourself,
you're really not

638
00:28:09,171 --> 00:28:09,720
by yourself.
But a lot of kids,

639
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:14,721
what they're doing now is they're 
playing these online games at playing 

640
00:28:14,721 --> 00:28:15,420
against other people.
They talk to each other online.

641
00:28:15,421 --> 00:28:18,260
They have headsets and they get,
I mean,

642
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:22,470
east sports is a big growing thing and 
it's,

643
00:28:22,471 --> 00:28:23,480
um,
I mean it's,

644
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:28,510
it's a fascinating thing because it's 
also sort of based on your ability to 

645
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:28,530
perform,
you know,

646
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,550
the ones who are the heroes are the ones
who are like,

647
00:28:31,551 --> 00:28:32,910
um,
when I was playing quake,

648
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:35,340
there was this dude named fatality was,
uh,

649
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,650
his name.
He just killed everybody was awesome,

650
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,520
but it was,
you know,

651
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:45,530
he was the,
he was the king because he was just the 

652
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:48,440
best at the game.
So in the community of people that were 

653
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,910
only judged by their performance,
he had risen to this very high level,

654
00:28:50,911 --> 00:28:52,020
but it was a community.

655
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:52,730
Well,
you know,

656
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,590
if you look at humans,
you look at chimpanzees,

657
00:28:54,591 --> 00:28:57,850
we clearly need the proximity of others,
like the physical proximity about it.

658
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,880
So yeah,
I mean the only way I can evaluate that 

659
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,111
is to say that's an that's awesome 
training for hunting and war and the 

660
00:29:05,301 --> 00:29:08,930
military does use those games to train 
their soldiers and so I get it.

661
00:29:08,931 --> 00:29:13,931
It's effective.
What I would do is look at suicide and 

662
00:29:13,931 --> 00:29:15,620
depression rates and gamers and see are 
they above or below the national average

663
00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:20,090
for that age group and if they're above 
then there's a problem.

664
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:26,230
Either depressive people are seeking 
that as a refuge or that activity makes 

665
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:29,330
people withdrawn and depressed and you 
know like either way it's a problem that

666
00:29:29,331 --> 00:29:31,340
needs to be solved that I have no idea 
what the data is,

667
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,840
but that's where I would look.

668
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:37,910
Now,
when you're researching all this data 

669
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:37,910
and you're putting together a book like 
tribe in your,

670
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:42,040
you're putting it out,
are you thinking to yourself that you 

671
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,040
have know that it's

672
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,700
not just an interesting study on human 
behavior,

673
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:48,790
but it's also probably important for 
people to read,

674
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,190
to kind of get an understanding and 
these,

675
00:29:51,191 --> 00:29:56,191
uh,
to get an understanding of what it is 

676
00:29:56,191 --> 00:29:57,190
it's causing people to have all this 
depression and anxiety that it may be.

677
00:29:57,191 --> 00:29:59,680
This is,
this is something that needs to be said.

678
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,350
I mean,
any categories,

679
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,520
category statement I shouldn't make,
but a lot of authors when they write 

680
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,241
books,
it's their firm conviction that their 

681
00:30:11,241 --> 00:30:11,730
book needs to be read by the public and 
that will help the public in some way,

682
00:30:11,731 --> 00:30:16,731
right?
It will eliminate life illuminated 

683
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:16,731
America,
luminate the world in some way.

684
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:16,731
That's important.
I mean,

685
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:19,380
that's just a starting point for the two
years of work that a book takes,

686
00:30:19,381 --> 00:30:20,670
right?
You have a child.

687
00:30:20,671 --> 00:30:23,580
Your assumption is the child is going to
be a good person in the world.

688
00:30:23,581 --> 00:30:25,860
Not a terrible person winds up shooting 
up a church,

689
00:30:25,861 --> 00:30:28,090
right?
It's just a starting basic assumption.

690
00:30:28,091 --> 00:30:31,590
So for me,
when I was writing tribe,

691
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,910
I was trying to make sense of a number 
of different number of different things.

692
00:30:35,911 --> 00:30:40,911
I mean,
one was that what the soldiers I was 

693
00:30:40,911 --> 00:30:43,101
with in Afghanistan,
I was really struck some months later 

694
00:30:43,101 --> 00:30:43,650
that a lot of them wanted to go back to 
this sort of flea,

695
00:30:43,651 --> 00:30:47,130
bitten godforsaken outpost where they 
got shot at it every day and didn't want

696
00:30:47,131 --> 00:30:48,360
to come home to the US.

697
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,640
It's like that needs explaining.
Yeah.

698
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,110
Right.
Um,

699
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:57,380
and it made me think of this uncle that 
I had sort of surrogate uncle named 

700
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:58,860
Ellis Ellis settle.
He was,

701
00:30:58,861 --> 00:31:03,861
um,
he was Lakota Sioux and Apache is born 

702
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:04,590
in 19,
29 out west.

703
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,750
And um,
he had a very rough,

704
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,280
interesting life and he's very well.
Right?

705
00:31:08,281 --> 00:31:13,281
And I remember him telling me he was a 
sort of mentor figure for me and I 

706
00:31:13,281 --> 00:31:13,530
remember him telling me when I was in my
twenties,

707
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:14,130
said,
you know,

708
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,200
all throughout the history of the United
States,

709
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,780
along the frontier,
and this is how he put it.

710
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:23,870
He said white people were always running
off to join the Indians and the Indians 

711
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:26,340
never ran off to join the white people.
And so here was this fact again,

712
00:31:26,341 --> 00:31:28,050
like,
oh no one wants to go,

713
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:32,040
go back to or go to the sort of modern 
world.

714
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,950
This wasn't even the modern world.
This is the modern world in 18,

715
00:31:34,951 --> 00:31:35,280
65,

716
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,340
right,
or eight or 17,

717
00:31:37,341 --> 00:31:38,570
55 or whatever.
I mean at the,

718
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,770
at the,
the,

719
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:44,800
um,
right at the time it was the modern 

720
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:44,800
world,
right?

721
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:44,900
Uh,
but so no one,

722
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,080
no,
it's basically the post agricultural,

723
00:31:48,081 --> 00:31:51,800
really a revolution world,
the industrial world,

724
00:31:51,801 --> 00:31:55,510
the world of organized religion,
organized government of,

725
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:00,230
of uh,
an industrial economy and an agriculture

726
00:32:00,231 --> 00:32:04,100
based system where people had jobs and 
you got up at dawn and plowed the fields

727
00:32:04,101 --> 00:32:09,101
all day and went to bed and your 
minister and your king told you what to 

728
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:09,101
do and you know,
whatever.

729
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:14,140
That's the modern world.
And that's what nobody wants to be part 

730
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,951
of,
including the soldiers I was with at 

731
00:32:17,951 --> 00:32:17,951
Restrepo.
Right.

732
00:32:17,951 --> 00:32:21,080
And so it just made me think maybe what 
the soldiers are missing isn't war,

733
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,440
although that certainly has its charms 
for some people,

734
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:29,470
but it's community is that they were 
with each other community with 

735
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:29,470
consequences.

736
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,050
That's right.
Exactly.

737
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:35,060
Community with consequences.
Likewise for the native Americans were 

738
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,100
the tribal societies in North America,
maybe with the young men,

739
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:42,310
young men and some young women along the
were looking for was an escape from the 

740
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,460
sort of oppressiveness of the 
congregation on Sunday mornings,

741
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:51,461
the oppressiveness of the society that 
they were toiling in the regimented 

742
00:32:51,461 --> 00:32:55,571
nature of an agric agrarian society.
Maybe what they longed for was the 

743
00:32:55,571 --> 00:32:59,390
closeness and freedom of a,
of a tribal society.

744
00:32:59,391 --> 00:33:00,830
And indeed,
I mean,

745
00:33:00,831 --> 00:33:04,610
there was this incredible sort of 
hemorrhaging of people from the frontier

746
00:33:04,611 --> 00:33:09,611
to the,
to the tribes and some and even when 

747
00:33:09,611 --> 00:33:09,740
people were kidnapped on rates,
uh,

748
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:14,880
by the Indians kidnapped from their log 
homes along the frontier and,

749
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:19,970
and abducted and forcibly adopted into 
these tribal societies.

750
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,560
Um,
when,

751
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:27,530
when given the chance to come home to be
repatriated some years later,

752
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,970
very often these people refuse to go.
They didn't want to go back,

753
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,610
they wanted to stay with their adopted,
tried their adopted community.

754
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:35,820
That,
that is,

755
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:41,110
that's amazing to me.
And it says a lot about what the way 

756
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,110
humans are wired to

757
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,200
wanted to live,
you know,

758
00:33:41,201 --> 00:33:46,201
that's,
that was one of the craziest aspects of 

759
00:33:46,201 --> 00:33:46,201
your book that I'd never heard that 
before.

760
00:33:46,201 --> 00:33:47,230
And how many people had done that.
They were,

761
00:33:47,231 --> 00:33:52,231
they,
they were kidnapped and then they said 

762
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:52,231
we like it here better.
Yeah,

763
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:52,700
that's right.
And again,

764
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,770
we're talking about more than 100 years 
ago.

765
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,800
So we think of as modern society today 
is the only escalated those anxieties 

766
00:34:01,191 --> 00:34:04,820
and woes and all the things that 
separated them from the tribal world.

767
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:09,970
That's right.
And one of the things about tribes is 

768
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:14,950
there,
there are sort of inherently 

769
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,361
egalitarian.
It very hard to pass on pass on wealth 

770
00:34:16,361 --> 00:34:21,020
and a non capitalist society in a mobile
nomadic society is impossible to pass on

771
00:34:21,021 --> 00:34:22,280
wealth because you can't carry it.
I mean,

772
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:24,830
there's no way to carry wealth when,
uh,

773
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,560
when you're in a nomadic hunter gatherer
society.

774
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:28,910
So,
so they're very,

775
00:34:28,911 --> 00:34:33,770
very egalitarian and they also guard 
against the sort of abuses of power,

776
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:37,250
sort of one alpha male trying to sort of
like bully people and take more than his

777
00:34:37,251 --> 00:34:42,251
share or for that matter,
people sort of freeloading and not 

778
00:34:42,251 --> 00:34:44,210
contributing to the group survival 
effort and sort of scamming a little bit

779
00:34:44,211 --> 00:34:45,890
of food here,
a little bit of whatever they're.

780
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,940
Both of those sins against the community
are really harshly punished.

781
00:34:49,941 --> 00:34:54,941
So it's very galitary.
Ian and I got a Galitary aneurysm is 

782
00:34:54,941 --> 00:34:55,690
something we are all wired for it.

783
00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:00,700
Right?
And I think one of the distresses of a 

784
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,340
modern capitalist society is that it 
can't be a Galitary and um,

785
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:02,130
and,
and,

786
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,770
and that's,
that's painful for people.

787
00:35:03,771 --> 00:35:06,380
But then if you introduce a crisis,
um,

788
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,390
the blitz in London,
for example,

789
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,730
uh,
an earthquake in Italy that I studied,

790
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:16,070
um,
what happens is that money doesn't 

791
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:16,160
matter anymore when the floodwaters are 
rising,

792
00:35:16,161 --> 00:35:21,161
when the bombs are falling,
social class doesn't matter at all in 

793
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:21,230
it.
It's like being in the,

794
00:35:21,231 --> 00:35:25,070
in the boxing gym,
how you conduct yourself with respect to

795
00:35:25,071 --> 00:35:28,070
the others around you is actually what 
gets evaluated in a,

796
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:33,120
you know,
a poor man can be brave and generous 

797
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,790
just as easily as a rich man.
There's no advantage to being wealthy or

798
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:38,910
powerful when it comes to those basic 
human qualities.

799
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,050
And that is a huge liberation.
And so I'm,

800
00:35:42,051 --> 00:35:47,051
you know,
I live in New York City and after nine 

801
00:35:47,051 --> 00:35:48,471
slash 11,
there was a bit of that in New York 

802
00:35:48,471 --> 00:35:48,471
City.

803
00:35:48,471 --> 00:35:48,471
I mean,
you know,

804
00:35:48,471 --> 00:35:48,471
there's a lot of more people in New 
York,

805
00:35:48,471 --> 00:35:48,471
a lot of rich people,
you know,

806
00:35:48,471 --> 00:35:49,770
whatever.
Obviously we all know that,

807
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,230
but after nine slash 11,
no one was rich or poor or anything.

808
00:35:52,231 --> 00:35:57,231
We were all New Yorkers wondering if 
there was going to be another bomb 

809
00:35:57,231 --> 00:35:58,140
dropped on us.
Basically another attack on the city.

810
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,170
So what happened in New York,
the suicide rate went down.

811
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,650
The,
the violent crime rate went down.

812
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,410
Vietnam vets in New York said,
who had pete,

813
00:36:07,411 --> 00:36:12,411
who suffered from Ptsd said that their 
symptoms disappeared after nine slash 

814
00:36:12,411 --> 00:36:16,821
11.
Everyone was needed and people and 

815
00:36:16,821 --> 00:36:19,191
everyone for awhile,
everyone was equal because we were all 

816
00:36:19,191 --> 00:36:21,420
facing some danger that terrified us and
that for all of its tragedy,

817
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,010
that is an intoxicating social state to 
be in for human beings.

818
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,090
That's so bizarre.
It's so bizarre,

819
00:36:29,091 --> 00:36:34,091
but it's also so make sense.
One of the things that I also thought 

820
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,720
was fascinating in your book where you 
were talking about ptsd,

821
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:40,810
Ptsd sufferers and how people in these 
veterans hospitals would be absolutely 

822
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:45,230
furious if they thought someone was 
faking their symptoms and that,

823
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:50,320
that they,
they had to be physically restrained to 

824
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,751
keep from attacking people that they 
thought were just joking the system and 

825
00:36:52,751 --> 00:36:55,370
how many people are on ptsd benefits.

826
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:58,480
Yeah.
I mean the numbers are really elusive,

827
00:36:58,481 --> 00:37:00,130
but.
Well,

828
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:05,190
you know what I have sort of anecdotally
from veterans as well as people within 

829
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,350
the va,
the Va administration who were acting as

830
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:13,351
therapists or whatever a group 
counselors is that there's certain 

831
00:37:13,351 --> 00:37:13,351
number of people and I,
you know,

832
00:37:13,351 --> 00:37:17,920
I don't know what the fraction is,
but there's a certain number of people 

833
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,490
who were not traumatized in war and ptsd
is hard to prove or disprove and it's,

834
00:37:21,311 --> 00:37:24,700
you know,
so obviously wide open for um,

835
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:29,820
either an unintentional misdiagnosis or 
an intentional misrepresentation,

836
00:37:30,911 --> 00:37:32,590
whatever.
And so I mean,

837
00:37:32,591 --> 00:37:34,840
of course,
and any bureaucratic system gets scammed

838
00:37:34,841 --> 00:37:37,170
and pts deep benefits are no different.
And,

839
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:42,360
but it really is traumatizing.
I mean seriously angering and 

840
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,021
traumatizing to soldiers who really were
traumatized because they really were in 

841
00:37:46,021 --> 00:37:50,461
combat.
And keep in mind only about 10 percent 

842
00:37:50,461 --> 00:37:50,740
of the US military experiences direct 
combat.

843
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,350
How would they know if someone was 
seriously traumatized?

844
00:37:55,351 --> 00:38:00,351
And the other thing that's fascinating 
is that as you were talking about in 

845
00:38:00,351 --> 00:38:03,480
these small societies,
free loaders are looked down upon as are

846
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:07,320
the greedy Alpha males and try to 
dominate the wealth like that.

847
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:11,640
The in these societies like egalitarian 
ideas are a much more,

848
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:17,080
much more openly expressed.
It's much more important that this is 

849
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,220
represented by these people that are 
legitimately suffering.

850
00:38:20,221 --> 00:38:22,200
Seeing someone was scamming the system 
and angry.

851
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:27,380
Whereas say if you had a hurt knee or 
something like that and you were going 

852
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,120
to a doctor and you saw someone who was 
faking a back injury,

853
00:38:30,121 --> 00:38:35,121
you wouldn't be upset right where they 
were just robbing money from the 

854
00:38:35,121 --> 00:38:36,190
insurance company and getting free.

855
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:41,490
Well yeah,
there's a hurt knee doesn't have a sort 

856
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:41,490
of emotional cargo to it.
Right.

857
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:45,691
But combat does.
I mean if you're in combat and you lost 

858
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:46,930
your best buddy and you got trauma from 
that as well,

859
00:38:46,931 --> 00:38:48,130
you should.
Um,

860
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:52,090
and then you're in some group therapy 
thing at the va with some guy who was in

861
00:38:52,091 --> 00:38:56,590
a rear base the whole time and is 
claiming 100 percent ptsd disability for

862
00:38:56,591 --> 00:38:57,880
some that never happened.
Like,

863
00:38:57,881 --> 00:38:59,320
yeah,
that would make you angry.

864
00:38:59,321 --> 00:39:03,790
It makes me angry because combat,
this is extremely emotional and he get,

865
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:05,110
I don't know,
is it one in a million?

866
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:06,250
One in 100,
100,000.

867
00:39:06,251 --> 00:39:11,251
I have no idea what the rates are and 
I'm not even sure what the va does and 

868
00:39:11,251 --> 00:39:11,280
there's,
there's,

869
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:16,380
you know,
in some ways incentivized not to find 

870
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:16,380
out,
but,

871
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:16,380
but it's,
I am,

872
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,790
I can tell you from like the real deal 
combat vets that happens,

873
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:23,791
they smell it instantly and one way it 
gets sorted out is that those guys who 

874
00:39:24,251 --> 00:39:26,710
are misrepresenting themselves get 
questioned by the combat vets.

875
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:28,060
Holy.
So what unit were you with?

876
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,040
Like he said,
what happened exactly.

877
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:31,720
Oh,
a mortar hit the other side of the base.

878
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,100
That's a pretty big base.
I've been there,

879
00:39:33,101 --> 00:39:38,101
you know,
it was a mile away and you're 

880
00:39:38,101 --> 00:39:38,101
traumatized.
Are you kidding?

881
00:39:38,101 --> 00:39:38,101
Like,
you know what I mean?

882
00:39:38,101 --> 00:39:38,101
They'll get questioned.
Right,

883
00:39:38,101 --> 00:39:39,640
right.
Um,

884
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:40,900
so I mean,
like you,

885
00:39:40,901 --> 00:39:42,850
my question,
someone who's bullshitting you about how

886
00:39:42,851 --> 00:39:47,851
much you know,
how much a fighting's done with MMA or 

887
00:39:47,851 --> 00:39:47,851
whatever.
I mean,

888
00:39:47,851 --> 00:39:52,570
wherever your area of expertise is,
I'm sure you can smell a fraud 

889
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:52,570
instantly.
Right?

890
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:56,820
Well everyone can.
That's one of the things is one of the 

891
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,701
characteristics of humans because it,
because we live in collective societies 

892
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:00,220
where we have to sort of trust one 
another.

893
00:40:00,221 --> 00:40:04,030
We're extremely good at smelling out 
misrepresentation and fraud were really,

894
00:40:04,031 --> 00:40:09,031
really good at it and it's one of the 
things that feels intolerable is to have

895
00:40:09,221 --> 00:40:14,221
someone who was unfairly gaining,
gaining from the hard work of the rest 

896
00:40:14,221 --> 00:40:14,500
of us.
And,

897
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,420
and,
and I should just say,

898
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:19,780
when I say a Galitary aneurysm,
I don't mean that there's no hierarchy.

899
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:20,790
Right,
right.

900
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,280
I mean it's complicated.
Systems need hierarch need to order,

901
00:40:24,281 --> 00:40:24,830
right?
Need Heart.

902
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:28,030
I mean groups need hierarchy so that not
everyone's a general.

903
00:40:28,031 --> 00:40:33,031
Not everyone's a private.
I mean you need organization within the 

904
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:35,730
group,
but I'm Galitary Ian means that nobody 

905
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:37,040
gets extra rights,
you know,

906
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,700
like all have the basically the same 
rights in the group.

907
00:40:39,701 --> 00:40:42,020
That's what that means.
It

908
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,740
meaning,
it all completely makes sense.

909
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:48,410
It particularly makes sense.
The idea that these people who were real

910
00:40:48,411 --> 00:40:53,411
combat vets who saw real action would be
instantaneously able to discern whether 

911
00:40:53,601 --> 00:40:55,110
or not someone was faking it.
Yeah.

912
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,170
Yeah.
And that this.

913
00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:02,350
But that,
this sort of mirrors what you were 

914
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:02,350
saying about these small tribes that in 
these small tribes,

915
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:06,350
someone who's a freeloader is a 
extremely dangerous to the group.

916
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:11,870
You'll look at it as a liability he 
looked at as someone who just can't be 

917
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:14,990
trusted and you need trust.
You need community.

918
00:41:14,991 --> 00:41:19,991
And this is,
this is what you're saying about a 

919
00:41:19,991 --> 00:41:22,570
combat troops that what they want to 
know is that you're going to be willing 

920
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:25,480
to put your own safety secondary to the 
safety,

921
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,900
the troop.
Right?

922
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:29,600
And if everyone does that,
everyone is safer.

923
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:29,900
But if

924
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,930
no one,
if some one person doesn't do that,

925
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,280
I mean,
that's always in the movies,

926
00:41:34,281 --> 00:41:36,860
right?
It's always the one guy who runs away or

927
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:39,140
the one guy who sells out or.

928
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:40,650
Yeah,
that's right.

929
00:41:40,651 --> 00:41:42,090
And you know,
those,

930
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,730
those human themes are enduring and very
powerful.

931
00:41:44,731 --> 00:41:46,740
So sometimes speak to a lot of liberal 
audiences,

932
00:41:46,741 --> 00:41:47,400
right?
And,

933
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,210
uh,
and so I,

934
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,670
I love doing this to them.
Like,

935
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,990
Oh,
I'm a Democrat,

936
00:41:51,991 --> 00:41:53,670
so I sort of know those people pretty 
well,

937
00:41:53,671 --> 00:41:55,560
right?
I grew up in Massachusetts and I get it,

938
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,310
you know,
and so,

939
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:57,320
uh,
it all,

940
00:41:57,321 --> 00:41:58,140
I'll say to them,
okay,

941
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:03,141
who hears it gets war and doesn't want 
to know anything or have anything to do 

942
00:42:03,141 --> 00:42:03,141
with war and Dah,
Dah,

943
00:42:03,141 --> 00:42:07,531
Dah.
And of course everyone raises their 

944
00:42:07,531 --> 00:42:07,531
hand,
right?

945
00:42:07,531 --> 00:42:07,531
And um,
and then I say,

946
00:42:07,531 --> 00:42:12,261
okay,
who here has paid money to go be 

947
00:42:12,261 --> 00:42:13,560
entertained by a Hollywood war movie?
And everyone raises their hand.

948
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,400
It seems like a contradiction.
But when I go onto say to them is,

949
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:18,240
look,
if,

950
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,150
if,
if work and get a room full of passivist

951
00:42:21,151 --> 00:42:23,680
to go pay money to watch it,
it's,

952
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:26,460
there's something important going on in 
that narrative.

953
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:32,480
It's not a,
you're not going to the movies to watch 

954
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:32,480
people get killed,
right?

955
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,591
You're not a sociopath.
You're going to the movies to see these 

956
00:42:36,591 --> 00:42:40,860
very ancient human concerns of who's 
loyal to the group,

957
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,900
who's a coward,
who's brave,

958
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:45,180
who's willing to risk their life for 
someone else.

959
00:42:45,181 --> 00:42:45,780
I mean,
these are,

960
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:50,070
these are things that have kept humans 
alive or endangered them as the case may

961
00:42:50,071 --> 00:42:54,390
be for a million years.
Of course they're compelling narratives.

962
00:42:54,391 --> 00:42:59,391
And in war you see those things happen,
like in a sort of accelerated intense 

963
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,780
rate.
I mean,

964
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,340
you know,
I grew up in a suburb.

965
00:43:02,341 --> 00:43:07,341
You almost never see someone have to 
choose between their own safety and the 

966
00:43:07,341 --> 00:43:07,341
community.
It never happens.

967
00:43:07,341 --> 00:43:10,320
That's the problem with the suburbs in 
war that happens every moment,

968
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:11,190
every day.
Right?

969
00:43:11,191 --> 00:43:16,191
So,
so it gives you this sort of like human 

970
00:43:16,191 --> 00:43:19,161
narrative in this incredibly compressed 
intense form which reconfirms the value,

971
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:21,360
the human values we all have about,
okay,

972
00:43:21,361 --> 00:43:24,810
if you're in a group,
you have to love that group.

973
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,840
Even if you're,
if you disliked some of the people in 

974
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,631
it,
like that's what it means to be part of 

975
00:43:32,631 --> 00:43:34,311
a group.
And that's what has kept humans alive 

976
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:34,311
for a very long time.

977
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:35,250
Even see that narrative in science 
fiction,

978
00:43:35,251 --> 00:43:37,660
futuristic movies like the Matrix right 
there,

979
00:43:37,661 --> 00:43:40,880
the one guy who sells out the other 
humans to the,

980
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,870
to the Matrix and just says,
look,

981
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:45,300
I want,
I want to be in the matrix.

982
00:43:45,301 --> 00:43:47,620
I want to have a great life and eat good
food.

983
00:43:47,621 --> 00:43:47,820
And

984
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:48,640
yeah,
I mean,

985
00:43:48,641 --> 00:43:49,300
listen,
once you,

986
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:53,530
once you are aware of this narrative,
you see it everywhere and I mean,

987
00:43:53,531 --> 00:43:58,531
one part,
there was some research that I did that 

988
00:43:58,531 --> 00:43:58,531
didn't actually make it into the book.
I couldn't quite fit it in,

989
00:43:58,531 --> 00:43:58,840
but I,
I,

990
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:03,990
I interviewed someone who had a 
consulting firm in Hollywood that did 

991
00:44:04,331 --> 00:44:08,920
basically sort of like market research 
for the big studios and they would,

992
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:14,550
they would screen films for audiences 
and then ask the audience's questions 

993
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,960
about the ending,
about the characters,

994
00:44:16,961 --> 00:44:21,961
about how to construct the plot.
They would sort of trying to figure out 

995
00:44:21,961 --> 00:44:21,961
what's the public one is c,
right?

996
00:44:21,961 --> 00:44:23,780
So what they found was that in disaster 
films,

997
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:26,280
very typically,
um,

998
00:44:26,281 --> 00:44:29,200
we're a community was facing a,
a disaster,

999
00:44:29,201 --> 00:44:30,900
right?
A plague or uh,

1000
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:31,230
you,
uh,

1001
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:32,240
um,
you know,

1002
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:34,250
a flood or a war or whatever when,
you know,

1003
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:37,140
when the community had to rally to 
survive,

1004
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:37,470
right?

1005
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:40,320
An alien invasion.
But what does a million scenarios.

1006
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:43,530
But it's all the same basic story.
You have these different characters.

1007
00:44:43,531 --> 00:44:48,531
There's usually a,
a male figure that takes the lead to 

1008
00:44:48,531 --> 00:44:50,190
difficulty defend the space.
Right.

1009
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
There is often a female figure that's 
connected to him that sort of takes 

1010
00:44:56,161 --> 00:45:00,510
place of the,
of the community that's being defended,

1011
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:02,610
take,
takes care of the dresses,

1012
00:45:02,611 --> 00:45:04,020
the wounds,
dresses,

1013
00:45:04,021 --> 00:45:07,260
the emotional wounds,
I mean turn takes care of all that stuff

1014
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,510
while the man or the men are sort of 
physically defending the place there's.

1015
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:17,780
And then there's a guy who offered was 
really wealthy or well off before the 

1016
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:22,581
catastrophe,
who's continuing to act in a self 

1017
00:45:22,581 --> 00:45:25,521
serving way even during the catastrophe,
when everyone's needed and everybody 

1018
00:45:25,981 --> 00:45:28,800
gets mad at that guy.
That guy always dies,

1019
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:34,140
always dies.
And then there's another character.

1020
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:39,200
And again,
this is just very common in these 

1021
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:39,200
narratives and easily Beta male.

1022
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:39,200
Yeah,
yeah,

1023
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:39,200
exactly.
Yeah,

1024
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,590
exactly.
No,

1025
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:45,620
but keep in mind that these narratives 
of Ford by public opinion or this isn't 

1026
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,530
the studio,
is trying to make the public,

1027
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:48,240
um,
force,

1028
00:45:48,241 --> 00:45:50,790
feed the public like gender roles and 
you know,

1029
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:52,890
whatever this is the public saying.
I like that.

1030
00:45:52,891 --> 00:45:57,891
I don't like that.
So the studios are responding to the 

1031
00:45:57,891 --> 00:45:57,891
questionnaires that these researchers 
give out.

1032
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:01,770
So one of the really interesting things,
and this is totally inflammatory,

1033
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:06,730
but the role of the person defending 
like fizzle,

1034
00:46:06,731 --> 00:46:11,731
you physically defending the community 
when they try to put a woman in that 

1035
00:46:11,731 --> 00:46:13,380
role,
people have a problem with it and,

1036
00:46:13,381 --> 00:46:18,381
and,
and frankly often women have a problem 

1037
00:46:18,381 --> 00:46:18,381
with it.
Like it's really,

1038
00:46:18,381 --> 00:46:19,800
it's really,
really interesting and women are just as

1039
00:46:19,801 --> 00:46:22,350
important as men in a crisis or in 
anything,

1040
00:46:22,351 --> 00:46:23,970
right?
But the,

1041
00:46:23,971 --> 00:46:28,971
what the public seems to want is the guy
with the sword and the woman with the 

1042
00:46:28,971 --> 00:46:29,440
bandage,
you know,

1043
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:29,750
or,
or,

1044
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,150
or with the sort of reassuring,
you know,

1045
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,950
like it gets divided like that and it's 
not,

1046
00:46:34,951 --> 00:46:39,951
again,
it's not the studio's forcing something 

1047
00:46:39,951 --> 00:46:42,531
on people as the people watching these 
films saying just voting on what the 

1048
00:46:42,531 --> 00:46:43,200
narrative that they like best.

1049
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,200
But the,
the other characters that I thought was 

1050
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:48,200
really hilarious.
There's often that,

1051
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:52,221
there is a,
an estranged husband who's betrayed his 

1052
00:46:52,221 --> 00:46:52,221
wife and family in some way.
He's on the outs,

1053
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,500
right?
Uh,

1054
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:55,740
with his family and his,
with his wife.

1055
00:46:55,741 --> 00:47:00,741
And then the crisis happens.
The martians invade the floodwaters 

1056
00:47:00,741 --> 00:47:00,741
rise,
whatever it is.

1057
00:47:00,741 --> 00:47:05,150
And he comes to the rescue and does the 
right thing and saves his wife and 

1058
00:47:05,161 --> 00:47:07,320
family and maybe even the wife's new 
boyfriend.

1059
00:47:07,321 --> 00:47:09,120
I mean he even could have gotten to that
stage.

1060
00:47:09,121 --> 00:47:11,490
Right.
And because he does the right thing,

1061
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:12,690
she takes him back.

1062
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:16,110
God,
it's funny,

1063
00:47:16,111 --> 00:47:21,111
man.
It's really just playing out these 

1064
00:47:21,111 --> 00:47:21,111
ancient archetypes to exactly what it's 
doing.

1065
00:47:21,111 --> 00:47:21,560
I mean they read,
I mean,

1066
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:25,050
those storylines resonate because 
they're ancient and because those,

1067
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:27,600
those roles in society helped us 
survive.

1068
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:32,840
And there's always the woman who in 
absence of the strong male figure rises 

1069
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,410
to the occasion herself when some of the
research I did with tribe,

1070
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,440
what I found,
I studied this coal mine disaster in 

1071
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,290
Canada.
So it was all men trapped a two O,

1072
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:45,550
two miles down in these collapsed 
passageways in the miles.

1073
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,510
Two miles down,
two miles down a,

1074
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:51,970
an angled shaft down.
Yeah.

1075
00:47:51,971 --> 00:47:56,971
So they had an explosion.
Some gases ignited and the passageways 

1076
00:47:56,971 --> 00:47:58,970
collapsed.
So they're two miles in their gaslight.

1077
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,410
Their,
their,

1078
00:47:59,411 --> 00:48:00,460
their,
their batteries.

1079
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:01,060
Last,
you know,

1080
00:48:01,061 --> 00:48:04,240
24 hours.
Their water last 48 hours.

1081
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,130
Pretty soon they're just sitting in 
darkness.

1082
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,410
Not Knowing,
not only if they'll survive,

1083
00:48:08,411 --> 00:48:10,720
not knowing if their bodies will ever 
even be recovered,

1084
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,710
they no way waveness sitting in darkness
trying.

1085
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:15,250
So whoa,
this is what happened.

1086
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,280
I mean obviously a situation like that 
takes needs leadership.

1087
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:23,910
So in the first minutes and hours there 
were these sort of Alpha males that 

1088
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:25,750
weren't necessarily crew bosses,
right?

1089
00:48:25,751 --> 00:48:30,751
They didn't,
they weren't within the traditional 

1090
00:48:30,751 --> 00:48:32,551
hierarchy.
They were just guys who grabbed a pick 

1091
00:48:32,551 --> 00:48:32,551
ax and a shovel and said,
come on guys,

1092
00:48:32,551 --> 00:48:33,730
we're going to try to dig our way out.
And they basically,

1093
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:38,920
I mean literally attacked the problem of
these collapsed mine shafts.

1094
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:44,780
It,
there was too much rubble to dig 

1095
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:44,780
through.
There were two miles down.

1096
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:44,780
So.
So they,

1097
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:44,780
they,
they,

1098
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:49,640
they dig,
dug and dug and dug and it required 

1099
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:49,690
these,
these guys.

1100
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,040
And again,
it was all men down there,

1101
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:54,760
but there was one sort of leader.
Was this very aggressive.

1102
00:48:54,761 --> 00:48:56,650
He didn't care what anyone else felt.
Oh,

1103
00:48:56,651 --> 00:48:57,850
you're scared.
I don't give a shit.

1104
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:00,430
Grab a shovel.
We got to solve this problem.

1105
00:49:00,431 --> 00:49:02,560
Like totally unempathic.
Right?

1106
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:09,090
When they realized they couldn't dig 
their way out and they ran out of 

1107
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:09,580
batteries and they're sitting in 
darkness,

1108
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:14,670
a new kind of leader was required and 
that was someone who was able to keep 

1109
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:15,880
people's spirits up.
Who is empathic,

1110
00:49:15,881 --> 00:49:17,580
who listened to.
The guy was really scared,

1111
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,060
was able to say,
hey listen man,

1112
00:49:19,061 --> 00:49:21,370
it's gonna be all right.
It's okay to be scared.

1113
00:49:21,371 --> 00:49:22,160
We're all scared,
you know,

1114
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:25,390
that kind of voice.
It's a different kind of leadership.

1115
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:27,400
Now.
Typically in society,

1116
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:32,020
the male role would be the guy with the 
pickax attacking the problem.

1117
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:37,200
The female role would be the person sort
of like trying to keep the group 

1118
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,160
emotionally together and,
and um,

1119
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:40,720
and functioning.
And,

1120
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:46,700
but what happens in a,
in a situation where there's all of one 

1121
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:49,651
sex,
those gender roles will be filled no 

1122
00:49:49,651 --> 00:49:49,990
matter what.

1123
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,510
It would just be filled by people of the
same sex.

1124
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:56,000
So if it was all women down there,
someone,

1125
00:49:56,001 --> 00:50:01,001
one woman would have grabbed the pickax 
and taken on what would be typically 

1126
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:03,310
considered a quote male role.
But she's female.

1127
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,140
So the gender roles that society needs 
to survive in adversity,

1128
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:10,000
in war,
in nature,

1129
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:14,020
in a collapsed coal mine.
It needs both gender roles,

1130
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:17,350
but either sex can fill those roles.
It's amazing.

1131
00:50:17,351 --> 00:50:22,351
And we will sort it out.
So it doesn't matter who's male and 

1132
00:50:22,351 --> 00:50:22,351
female.
What matters to that?

1133
00:50:22,351 --> 00:50:25,420
Those two basic kinds of leadership and 
caretaking get taken care of.

1134
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:29,120
Wow.
So how did those guys get out?

1135
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:32,840
They eventually.
The rescuers eventually got to them.

1136
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:36,380
How long were they down there for?
Over a week.

1137
00:50:36,381 --> 00:50:37,670
I might even been two weeks.
I mean,

1138
00:50:37,671 --> 00:50:38,130
they,
they,

1139
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:39,040
oh,
oh,

1140
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:40,460
eight days.
So I can't remember.

1141
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:40,980
Actually.
It's something,

1142
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:42,110
it's something like a week.
Uh,

1143
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:45,290
how did they survive?
I mean barely.

1144
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:45,800
I mean,
you know,

1145
00:50:45,801 --> 00:50:46,210
they,
I mean,

1146
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:47,510
they ran out of water.
They were,

1147
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:49,600
they were eating the bark off the 
timbers.

1148
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:50,050
Uh,
the,

1149
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,440
you know,
the support structures,

1150
00:50:51,441 --> 00:50:53,810
they were eating coal.
I mean,

1151
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,100
you can call.
We're trying to.

1152
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,170
Yeah,
they were drinking their own urine.

1153
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:57,860
I mean,
you know.

1154
00:50:57,890 --> 00:50:58,270
Yeah.
And they,

1155
00:50:58,271 --> 00:50:59,180
the guys died.
I mean,

1156
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:02,480
not everyone survived.
I'm one guy was trapped.

1157
00:51:02,481 --> 00:51:04,820
His arms trapped between two collapse 
timbers and they were,

1158
00:51:04,821 --> 00:51:09,821
you know,
it was a pretty lively conversation 

1159
00:51:09,821 --> 00:51:12,101
about and he was begging them to cut his
arm off so that he could at least be 

1160
00:51:12,101 --> 00:51:14,801
free and there was a pretty lively 
conversation with the other men in the 

1161
00:51:14,801 --> 00:51:16,130
group.
Like did we do that or not?

1162
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,560
Right.
And they decided not to do that.

1163
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,510
If they,
all they had was an acs.

1164
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,370
They're like,
we chopped his arm off and free him.

1165
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:23,990
He might die from that.
Right.

1166
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,900
And he was removed from where those guys
were.

1167
00:51:26,901 --> 00:51:28,520
So he was lonely.
That was the thing.

1168
00:51:28,521 --> 00:51:29,810
He was lonely.
He was like,

1169
00:51:29,811 --> 00:51:31,520
cut my arm off.
I want to join you guys.

1170
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:34,370
And they didn't any,
any died.

1171
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,560
Oh,
amazing.

1172
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:39,830
Amazing sentence.
Yeah.

1173
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,130
And so,
you know what I mean?

1174
00:51:43,131 --> 00:51:45,740
Not to whatever to steer this 
conversation too much,

1175
00:51:45,741 --> 00:51:50,741
but I mean that's a,
that's a microcosm in some ways for 

1176
00:51:50,741 --> 00:51:50,741
America,
right?

1177
00:51:50,741 --> 00:51:54,131
I mean every country is potentially 
trapped in a coal mine trying to figure 

1178
00:51:54,131 --> 00:51:54,131
out how to survive.
We don't know.

1179
00:51:54,131 --> 00:51:55,520
I mean the day before nine slash 11,
we didn't know like 9:11

1180
00:51:55,521 --> 00:51:56,340
was coming,
right?

1181
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,280
We don't know what's coming.
Right,

1182
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:01,250
and the only way for any group of 
people,

1183
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:06,880
whether you it's $330,
million or 18 people as it was in the 

1184
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:11,610
coal mine,
the only way for any group of people 

1185
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:11,610
that to survive is to act collectively.

1186
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:16,540
Right?
Humans don't survive in nature by 

1187
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,791
themselves and so in that coal mine,
both kinds of people were needed.

1188
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:22,060
They happen to be all men but it didn't 
need it.

1189
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:22,820
Whatever.
It doesn't matter.

1190
00:52:22,821 --> 00:52:24,470
Gender doesn't matter.
I mean sex doesn't matter.

1191
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:29,890
They need to both kinds of people.
They needed aggressive Alphas that 

1192
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:33,791
attack the problem and didn't care how 
people felt and were interested in like 

1193
00:52:33,791 --> 00:52:35,300
strict law and order and the group,
you do this,

1194
00:52:35,301 --> 00:52:37,520
you do that.
You do what I say is a survival.

1195
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:41,990
You needed those kinds of people and you
needed the other kind like,

1196
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,370
hey,
we're going to be all right.

1197
00:52:43,371 --> 00:52:44,420
Are you feeling okay?
Yeah,

1198
00:52:44,421 --> 00:52:44,990
we're,
you know,

1199
00:52:44,991 --> 00:52:49,370
like that kind of collaborative,
empathic person.

1200
00:52:49,371 --> 00:52:53,180
You needed that also.
So when you look at the politics in this

1201
00:52:53,181 --> 00:52:58,181
country,
you need both conservatism and 

1202
00:52:58,181 --> 00:52:58,181
liberalism,
right?

1203
00:52:58,181 --> 00:53:02,240
You cannot,
I mean a completely conservative America

1204
00:53:02,241 --> 00:53:03,890
will be well defended,
right?

1205
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:05,750
No one's going to mess with us,
right?

1206
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:08,030
America first,
like no one will mess with us,

1207
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,750
but what will let,
what will be left unaddressed is some of

1208
00:53:11,751 --> 00:53:14,560
the internal dynamics of this country,
um,

1209
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,780
which is frankly not at the foremost of 
conservative thought.

1210
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:20,990
I mean sort of racial disparity,
economic disparity and all that stuff.

1211
00:53:20,991 --> 00:53:22,160
Like,
you know,

1212
00:53:22,161 --> 00:53:27,161
I mean,
that's not at the foremost of the 

1213
00:53:27,161 --> 00:53:27,161
conservative agenda and it shouldn't be.
It doesn't need to be,

1214
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:30,120
it doesn't need to be because it's the 
forefront of the liberal agenda.

1215
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:34,140
And God forbid you have a country that's
completely run by liberals.

1216
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:36,900
It'll get overrun immediately by the 
nearest armed neighbor.

1217
00:53:36,901 --> 00:53:37,350
Right?
What'd you.

1218
00:53:37,351 --> 00:53:40,200
Liberals just aren't wired that way to 
be suspicious of the world.

1219
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:44,520
But what it,
what liberals do quite well is to try to

1220
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:49,360
figure out a sort of system of fairness 
within the group that gets it.

1221
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:54,420
Know it's just tries to equalize things 
and get everyone to sort of participate 

1222
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:57,891
in to be valued and taken care of.
Like I mean that it's all lovely,

1223
00:53:57,961 --> 00:54:02,961
right?
I mean that's needed also and so that 

1224
00:54:02,961 --> 00:54:04,920
every country is at its best when you 
have both of those dynamics going on and

1225
00:54:04,921 --> 00:54:06,930
they're in a kind of dynamic tension 
with each other,

1226
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:12,140
but neither completely takes over.
One of the things that breaks my heart 

1227
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:14,670
watching this country is,
is there's this idea on both sides,

1228
00:54:14,671 --> 00:54:19,671
on the liberal side and on the 
conservative side that the other not 

1229
00:54:19,671 --> 00:54:22,341
only is totally wrong,
but it's totally immoral and shouldn't 

1230
00:54:22,341 --> 00:54:22,341
exist,
right?

1231
00:54:22,341 --> 00:54:26,720
It's just not true in this country is 
not going to find peace until both sides

1232
00:54:27,211 --> 00:54:31,230
of the political equation sort of reach 
across and shake the other person's hand

1233
00:54:31,231 --> 00:54:31,740
and say,
look,

1234
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,480
I disagree with you on almost 
everything,

1235
00:54:33,481 --> 00:54:36,360
but I'm glad you're with us.
I need you and I need to because I don't

1236
00:54:36,361 --> 00:54:41,361
think like you do.
I need you to think like you do and 

1237
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:41,520
until this country figures out how to do
that,

1238
00:54:41,521 --> 00:54:46,521
we're going to be in this sort of awful 
partisans strife that eventually will 

1239
00:54:46,521 --> 00:54:50,571
destroy us.
I bullets are not going to take down 

1240
00:54:50,571 --> 00:54:51,840
this country words well and they're 
going to be our words and it just breaks

1241
00:54:51,841 --> 00:54:55,440
my heart to see this dynamic not only 
going on and on,

1242
00:54:55,441 --> 00:54:55,740
but getting

1243
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:56,560
worse,
worse.

1244
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:58,240
It does seem to be getting worse and 
worse.

1245
00:54:58,241 --> 00:55:03,241
And what's seems to be new is the idea 
from the liberals to silence people on 

1246
00:55:03,641 --> 00:55:07,090
the right and to,
to think that free speech is important.

1247
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:11,770
What's important is their ideas and that
their ideas are especially.

1248
00:55:11,771 --> 00:55:16,771
I think now that trump is president and 
I think people feel even more emboldened

1249
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:20,150
locked up in this.
I mean,

1250
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:20,720
listen,
I mean,

1251
00:55:20,721 --> 00:55:21,860
I think it will.
I mean honestly,

1252
00:55:21,861 --> 00:55:23,270
I think it's equally both sides,
but I.

1253
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:24,200
But I agree with you.
I mean,

1254
00:55:24,201 --> 00:55:26,510
the problem with the right with the left
for me,

1255
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:27,650
and again,
I'm a Democrat,

1256
00:55:27,651 --> 00:55:28,370
so I,
you know,

1257
00:55:28,371 --> 00:55:31,550
I love evaluating my own size problems 
because they drive me.

1258
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:34,460
They make me more upset than the right 
wing's problems,

1259
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,230
right?
Because because they're my people.

1260
00:55:36,231 --> 00:55:36,740
Right.
And I'm like,

1261
00:55:36,741 --> 00:55:37,340
come on,
can you,

1262
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:39,240
can you act a little better?

1263
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:44,320
Pleased to see the irony though,
that you've chosen a tribe and that 

1264
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,400
tribe of people that you don't even know
that these people are just.

1265
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:46,550
It's a political tribe.

1266
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:47,590
Well,
I mean,

1267
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:48,080
listen,
I,

1268
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:53,200
I share those political,
some of those political ideals and the 

1269
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:53,850
conservative ideals I don't,
I don't share,

1270
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:59,100
but I would hate to live in a country 
that didn't have conservatives in it 

1271
00:55:59,100 --> 00:55:59,950
even though I disagree because I 
disagree with them.

1272
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:02,530
I don't want to be surrounded by people 
I agree with.

1273
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:07,600
Right.
And there are conservatives to do not 

1274
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:07,600
want liberals in this country.
Right.

1275
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,410
Shame on them.
Sure.

1276
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:10,960
And likewise for liberals come in here 
and on both sides.

1277
00:56:10,961 --> 00:56:15,580
So I think both sides tried to silence 
the voices of the other side.

1278
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:16,210
Frankly,
I don't,

1279
00:56:16,211 --> 00:56:16,750
you know,
that's,

1280
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:18,850
that's a sin.
I think that's committed equally on both

1281
00:56:18,851 --> 00:56:21,820
sides.
But one thing I wanted to bring up,

1282
00:56:21,821 --> 00:56:25,270
because I actually made mistake last 
time I was on your on your show,

1283
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:30,720
I mentioned a book and I got the name 
wrong and it's such a good book and I 

1284
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,300
wanted to,
I just saw on twitter that people trying

1285
00:56:31,301 --> 00:56:33,040
to find it and they couldn't because I 
got the name rock,

1286
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,600
it's called our political,
our political nature,

1287
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:40,240
and by a guy named Avi Tushman and he 
collected an awful lot of data about the

1288
00:56:40,241 --> 00:56:45,241
fact that political opinion is about 50 
percent determined by genetics.

1289
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:49,870
In other words,
you inherit about half of your political

1290
00:56:49,871 --> 00:56:53,800
opinion and the other half is acquired 
through experience,

1291
00:56:53,801 --> 00:56:56,170
through exposure.
So if you grew up in a liberal family,

1292
00:56:56,171 --> 00:56:57,520
yeah,
you're getting you probably you're,

1293
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:03,720
you're about 50 percent likely to wind 
up being a liberal because you absorb 

1294
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,810
though that way of seeing the world.
If I'm a Democrat,

1295
00:57:04,811 --> 00:57:06,910
if I had.
I grown up in a conservative family,

1296
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:12,690
I think I'd be a conservative.
And I actually think having read this 

1297
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:17,191
book,
I think I'm actually a genetic 

1298
00:57:17,191 --> 00:57:18,670
conservative that adopted liberal values
because of my environment.

1299
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,880
I think there's a lot of people who are 
genetic liberals who have adopted 

1300
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:23,880
conservative values.
I mean it.

1301
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,870
It's about 50 slash 50,
but the point is,

1302
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:28,960
so it's Avi Tishman our political 
nature.

1303
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:30,520
That's the name of the book.
I got it wrong.

1304
00:57:30,521 --> 00:57:34,000
I just wanted to correct that,
but the point of this to me is that,

1305
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,480
and he knows this,
I mean scientists know this because when

1306
00:57:37,481 --> 00:57:42,481
they look at identical twins that share 
almost all of their DNA,

1307
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:47,790
identical twins later in life are far 
more likely to have the same political 

1308
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:51,370
opinion than fraternal twins,
which don't share all their DNA.

1309
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:53,080
You understand what I'm saying?
Yeah,

1310
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:56,140
so that's how they know this.
When they looked at identical twins,

1311
00:57:56,141 --> 00:57:59,650
there's a much higher concordance of a 
political opinion later in life than for

1312
00:57:59,651 --> 00:58:01,840
fraternal twins.
That's how they know that it's around 50

1313
00:58:01,841 --> 00:58:04,990
percent of your political view is 
determined by genetics.

1314
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:09,010
If it's determined by genetics,
that means it had survival value.

1315
00:58:09,011 --> 00:58:14,011
That means that liberalism and 
conservatism both had survival value in 

1316
00:58:14,561 --> 00:58:17,200
our evolutionary past and is as a 
result,

1317
00:58:17,201 --> 00:58:22,201
has become encoded in our DNA.
Like other behaviors like generosity,

1318
00:58:22,301 --> 00:58:25,480
other character traits like generosity,
courage,

1319
00:58:25,481 --> 00:58:27,760
things like that,
those are all encoded in our DNA because

1320
00:58:27,761 --> 00:58:30,940
they had survival value will likewise 
conservatism and liberalism,

1321
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:35,941
which means that in the argument,
the discussion in this country about 

1322
00:58:35,941 --> 00:58:37,300
politics,
you can disagree with people,

1323
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:42,660
go for it,
democracy comes out of disagreement and 

1324
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:45,271
compromise is great,
but what you cannot do is point your 

1325
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:47,530
finger across the aisle and say,
not only are you wrong but you shouldn't

1326
00:58:47,531 --> 00:58:50,230
exist,
like go away,

1327
00:58:50,231 --> 00:58:50,920
disappear.

1328
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:55,920
You're not part of what America is.
It's that assertion is completely 

1329
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,440
contradictory to evolution and if and if
it's contradicted your evolution,

1330
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:02,590
it won't work well.
It seems to me that people have a really

1331
00:59:02,591 --> 00:59:05,980
difficult time managing conflict,
even managing verbal conflict,

1332
00:59:05,981 --> 00:59:08,980
that when someone disagrees with them,
they want to silence that person.

1333
00:59:08,981 --> 00:59:13,981
They want to yell at that person,
they want to scream and they they think 

1334
00:59:13,981 --> 00:59:16,501
about their own thoughts rather than 
putting themselves in the position of 

1335
00:59:16,501 --> 00:59:19,341
the other person or objectively 
recognizing that there is an important 

1336
00:59:19,341 --> 00:59:19,870
factor,
they'd both.

1337
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:22,220
It's important to have both sides.

1338
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:27,370
It's important to even be challenged on 
your ideas so you can solidify what's 

1339
00:59:27,771 --> 00:59:29,510
the root cause of your ideas.
What is,

1340
00:59:29,511 --> 00:59:30,990
where were they coming from?
What,

1341
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,210
what,
how,

1342
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:37,240
how much have you examined these ideas?
Are you just married to them because 

1343
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,681
they were given to you?
Are these things you've adopted or are 

1344
00:59:41,681 --> 00:59:45,551
these really well considered thoughts 
that you've put through the mill?

1345
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:46,800
Right.
I mean,

1346
00:59:46,801 --> 00:59:48,840
the thing is there were rules to 
contests,

1347
00:59:48,841 --> 00:59:49,350
right?
I mean,

1348
00:59:49,351 --> 00:59:51,300
there are rules and MMA,
right?

1349
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:55,170
There are rules and boxing.
There were rules in marriages,

1350
00:59:55,171 --> 00:59:55,900
right?
I mean if you,

1351
00:59:55,901 --> 01:00:00,901
you would never stay in a marriage where
your spouse treated you the way the 

1352
01:00:01,981 --> 01:00:03,930
political parties treat each other right
now.

1353
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:05,700
You would never stay.
I mean,

1354
01:00:05,701 --> 01:00:07,560
there's incredibly contemptuous,
mocking,

1355
01:00:07,561 --> 01:00:10,160
disparaging tone that both sides have.
Like you,

1356
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:11,430
you were like,
I'm Outta here.

1357
01:00:11,431 --> 01:00:16,431
You know,
my wife clearly just thinks I'm a 

1358
01:00:16,431 --> 01:00:16,431
complete dirt bag,
or no one had talked.

1359
01:00:16,431 --> 01:00:18,120
You know,
you don't talk to someone like that that

1360
01:00:18,121 --> 01:00:19,860
you have any respect for.
Right?

1361
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:24,980
I'm Outta here.
I think no one would stay in a marriage 

1362
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:24,980
like that and what's happened,
and this is new,

1363
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:24,980
right?
This,

1364
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:26,550
I,
we didn't grow up with this.

1365
01:00:26,551 --> 01:00:31,110
Like this is a new thing where the 
political parties talk to each other.

1366
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,910
I mean,
disagreement is great,

1367
01:00:32,911 --> 01:00:33,500
right?
Come from,

1368
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:38,520
you know,
we want eventually you compromise and 

1369
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:38,520
you figure something out where nobody's 
happy,

1370
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:38,520
but that,
you know,

1371
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:38,790
the machine goes on,
right?

1372
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:43,800
The ship sails on.
What's new now is this content and it 

1373
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:47,490
toxic in marriage and it's toxic in a 
country too.

1374
01:00:47,491 --> 01:00:49,170
And this is a new thing.
And I think,

1375
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:50,820
and I think,
um,

1376
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:55,970
if you really,
if you really take in the reality that 

1377
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:59,700
this truth,
that half of our political opinions are 

1378
01:00:59,700 --> 01:00:59,750
genetically wired,
you got to get rid of the contempt,

1379
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:00,930
you know,
I mean,

1380
01:01:00,931 --> 01:01:03,270
it's part of what we are as most people 
are aware of that.

1381
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:04,170
No,
they're not right.

1382
01:01:04,171 --> 01:01:05,370
That's what I'm talking about it.
I mean,

1383
01:01:05,371 --> 01:01:06,720
you know,
um,

1384
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,430
and Congress plays on this,
right?

1385
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:13,431
It's a great campaign strategy to like 
say things that are hateful things about

1386
01:01:14,251 --> 01:01:16,200
the other side and consolidate your 
base.

1387
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,390
And if you consult in both sides,
do this right,

1388
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:23,770
and if you consolidate your base,
then you're more likely to win the 

1389
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:26,991
election you have,
you're in a more solid political 

1390
01:01:26,991 --> 01:01:27,870
position so they can.
And we know behavior,

1391
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:30,330
behavioral psychologists will tell you 
that one way to,

1392
01:01:30,331 --> 01:01:30,990
to,
um,

1393
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:36,770
make a group cohere,
make it a closed ranks and strengthened 

1394
01:01:36,931 --> 01:01:41,931
its group commitment to itself.
One way to do that is to introduce an 

1395
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:45,291
enemy,
and when there's no enemy groups 

1396
01:01:45,291 --> 01:01:47,100
naturally disperse because people just 
go off to do their individual thing.

1397
01:01:47,101 --> 01:01:47,850
Of course,
you know,

1398
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:49,830
you have the freedom to do that.
There's no threat anywhere.

1399
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:51,510
Introduce a threat,
boom,

1400
01:01:51,511 --> 01:01:54,720
everyone's in a group.
So what politicians do is they,

1401
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:59,870
they,
they create a threat where there is 

1402
01:01:59,870 --> 01:01:59,870
none.
You know,

1403
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:02,780
they say that other political party,
they're actually trying to destroy 

1404
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:04,650
democracy.
They're not part of the democracy.

1405
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:07,470
They're actually trying to destroy it.
They're trying to destroy this country.

1406
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:10,110
Um,
the same thing happened at the beginning

1407
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:12,540
of the Spanish civil war.
My father grew up in Spain and I studied

1408
01:02:12,541 --> 01:02:13,860
this matter,
civil war quite a lot.

1409
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:17,730
The democratic reforms that were,
that were coming in the thirties,

1410
01:02:17,731 --> 01:02:19,680
you know,
just land things like,

1411
01:02:19,681 --> 01:02:21,420
you know,
the vote for women,

1412
01:02:21,421 --> 01:02:21,800
you have a,
you know,

1413
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:26,810
pretty normal things,
but there were a threat to the power 

1414
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:28,620
structure in Spain and the military and 
the,

1415
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:30,420
um,
so far right in Spain,

1416
01:02:30,421 --> 01:02:33,690
the fascist basically said that those 
democratic reforms where people who were

1417
01:02:33,691 --> 01:02:37,080
trying to destroy Spain.
So you create an enemy that consolidates

1418
01:02:37,081 --> 01:02:38,790
your power and you go on to win the 
election.

1419
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:41,880
It's great campaign strategy.
It's just terrible for the nation.

1420
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:43,990
Yeah.
This,

1421
01:02:43,991 --> 01:02:46,360
lock her up,
lock her up.

1422
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:48,220
When,
when trump was running,

1423
01:02:48,221 --> 01:02:49,180
that was the big thing,
right?

1424
01:02:49,181 --> 01:02:52,060
The enemy that yet this was the enemy 
that was Hillary Clinton.

1425
01:02:52,061 --> 01:02:57,061
She represented the evil Democrats who 
had been stealing and robbing and

1426
01:02:57,910 --> 01:02:58,420
right.
And I,

1427
01:02:58,421 --> 01:02:59,350
you know,
I listen,

1428
01:02:59,351 --> 01:03:01,720
I totally understand being in 
disagreement with Democrats.

1429
01:03:01,721 --> 01:03:06,721
Right?
But it's a different matters say that 

1430
01:03:06,721 --> 01:03:09,001
they're actually antithetical.
The Democrats are antithetical to free 

1431
01:03:09,001 --> 01:03:09,870
democratic ideals,

1432
01:03:10,270 --> 01:03:15,270
but just seems to meet to.
There's not a good party right now that 

1433
01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:15,890
the Republicans are mass,
that Democrats are a mess.

1434
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:18,310
You know,
they both suck,

1435
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:20,460
so reform them,
right?

1436
01:03:20,461 --> 01:03:21,700
I mean,
or creative work,

1437
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:24,670
isn't there also an issue with just 
having two sides,

1438
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:29,700
right?
Having the Yankees versus the red sox 

1439
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:29,700
every year in the world series.
Well those two sides,

1440
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:29,700
I just

1441
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:34,460
do represent the sort of,
the genetic strains in our liberal and 

1442
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:34,460
conservative.
I mean,

1443
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:39,580
it's good.
It's going to break down one way or 

1444
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:39,580
another in that direction.
Right.

1445
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:40,210
And so,
I mean,

1446
01:03:40,211 --> 01:03:45,211
it is sort of a binary.
I mean our brains are sort of binary in 

1447
01:03:45,211 --> 01:03:45,211
that way.
Um,

1448
01:03:45,211 --> 01:03:48,931
I mean as humans surviving the wild,
you have to defend your group and you 

1449
01:03:48,931 --> 01:03:49,230
need fairness within the group.
The,

1450
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:53,140
the two things you have to do to survive
and remain a group.

1451
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:53,740
Right?
Right.

1452
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:59,020
And,
and so those tasks have been sort of 

1453
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:01,921
like subcontracted out to conservatives 
into liberals and it's been that way for

1454
01:04:02,351 --> 01:04:07,351
a very long time and you can even see 
some of those same behaviors like 

1455
01:04:07,351 --> 01:04:07,390
insearch in chimpanzee society.
Right?

1456
01:04:07,391 --> 01:04:09,490
So this is very,
very ancient behavior.

1457
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:15,030
So like it,
and I think you have to grips with it 

1458
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:16,810
doesn't mean that the two groups have to
act so a bismal with each other.

1459
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:21,810
And,
and I really think that if you want to 

1460
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:21,810
save the,
if you want to sort of save this country

1461
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:22,780
morally,
politically,

1462
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,330
nationally,
maybe,

1463
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:26,970
um,
you know,

1464
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:31,980
really what you need is a bipartisan 
committee in Congress that calls people 

1465
01:04:32,291 --> 01:04:37,291
out and calls them out for doing and 
saying things that undermine our sense 

1466
01:04:38,171 --> 01:04:43,171
of unity as a nation.
So when Democrats say he's not my 

1467
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:46,561
president,
that undermines the understanding of 

1468
01:04:46,561 --> 01:04:47,260
what democracy is easier,
president.

1469
01:04:47,290 --> 01:04:52,290
Like he got voted in man.
Like that's what happens in a democracy 

1470
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:54,070
is the guy you didn't vote for ends up 
being your president.

1471
01:04:54,071 --> 01:04:56,410
That's what a democracy is.
So just deal with it,

1472
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:57,670
right?
I hate that.

1473
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,770
I hate that I'm a democrat.
I didn't vote for him.

1474
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:02,440
But I hate when people say that.
And likewise,

1475
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:07,470
when Donald trump sit,
when citizen trump was accusing Barack 

1476
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:09,910
Obama.
And I understand not liking Obama,

1477
01:05:09,911 --> 01:05:11,920
I don't really care if you don't like 
them or don't like him,

1478
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:17,160
but when citizen trump accused Barack 
Obama of not being a citizen and gop 

1479
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:21,730
didn't repudiate that,
I mean,

1480
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:22,390
think about it.

1481
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:28,980
Citizen trump was telling every veteran 
and soldier fighting overseas that their

1482
01:05:29,411 --> 01:05:32,860
commander in chief was an imposter,
was a fraud,

1483
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:36,640
was not an American citizen,
and has usurped the White House,

1484
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:41,910
right?
That's a terribly destructive thing to 

1485
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:43,030
tell men and women in uniform or in a 
trench getting shot at,

1486
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:48,270
right?
And the gop like the DNC with this 

1487
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:48,270
stupid.
He's not my president thing,

1488
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:51,610
that the DNC is not rejecting that idea.
They let people say it,

1489
01:05:51,611 --> 01:05:52,960
they don't denounce it,
right?

1490
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:58,440
The gop never repudiated that stupid 
idea that trump came along with and for 

1491
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,250
the good of the nation.
They both had to write.

1492
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:05,280
And this isn't a free speech issue.
Everyone has the right legal right to 

1493
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:05,500
make a fool of themselves.
Go for it.

1494
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:10,920
But that doesn't mean the two political 
parties have to stay silent in the face 

1495
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:12,310
of things that are completely toxic to 
our democracy.

1496
01:06:12,311 --> 01:06:17,311
And they really should have spoken out 
and I think some kind of bipartisan 

1497
01:06:17,311 --> 01:06:20,671
commission in Congress that would call 
out those are the worst outrageous and 

1498
01:06:20,671 --> 01:06:25,021
calling the political parties to 
denounce them that that would be 

1499
01:06:25,021 --> 01:06:25,330
enormously positive thing in this 
country.

1500
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,080
I agree with you,

1501
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:31,100
but I think it would take a truly 
exceptional person to look at the other 

1502
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:33,780
side's faults and,
and not capitalize on it,

1503
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:34,660
you know,
and,

1504
01:06:34,661 --> 01:06:38,230
and especially even if it's a false 
thing like the Obama thing with,

1505
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:43,490
with trump or any,
any number of things you could find in 

1506
01:06:43,490 --> 01:06:45,810
that regard.
But it seems to me like this is like the

1507
01:06:45,811 --> 01:06:50,811
perfect time.
If there was ever going to be a time 

1508
01:06:50,811 --> 01:06:51,420
where a third party with some sort of 
centrist type party would come around,

1509
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:54,330
this would be the perfect time where 
people are so.

1510
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:57,240
And we also,
I think people recognize that what we're

1511
01:06:57,241 --> 01:07:02,241
seeing on the right and the left in 
regards to Hillary Clinton or Donald 

1512
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:05,970
Trump is you're seeing people that are 
pretending to be this thing right?

1513
01:07:05,971 --> 01:07:07,950
With Donald Trump.
He's a lifelong Democrat.

1514
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,450
And then all of a sudden he's a 
Republican.

1515
01:07:09,451 --> 01:07:12,840
He's talking about God and I mean,
this is just like,

1516
01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:17,930
it's a show,
it's a little dog and pony show on the 

1517
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:19,941
right.
And on the left you've got this woman 

1518
01:07:19,941 --> 01:07:20,550
who was part of the Clinton Foundation.
They were essentially,

1519
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:24,060
it was a pay to play scheme.
They were making millions of dollars and

1520
01:07:24,061 --> 01:07:29,061
hundreds of thousand dollars for 
bullshit speeches that they would give 

1521
01:07:29,061 --> 01:07:29,061
to the banks.
And this is not some sort of a,

1522
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:34,190
a real liberal.
This is not a that the ideas that you 

1523
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:36,010
were embracing about liberal values.
I

1524
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:36,560
mean,
no,

1525
01:07:36,561 --> 01:07:41,561
I mean the two parties basically have 
become sort of cartels to keep 

1526
01:07:41,561 --> 01:07:41,561
themselves in power.
Yes.

1527
01:07:41,561 --> 01:07:42,480
That's a great way to pray.
And,

1528
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,210
and um,
and you know,

1529
01:07:45,211 --> 01:07:50,211
he'll,
hillary was absolutely part of that on 

1530
01:07:50,211 --> 01:07:50,211
the,
on the,

1531
01:07:50,211 --> 01:07:50,570
on the left and you know,
it,

1532
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:55,580
uh,
all of it's antithetical to the highest 

1533
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:58,641
ideals of the framers of the 
constitution and the people that 

1534
01:07:58,641 --> 01:07:59,030
established this country.
And in and I,

1535
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:00,630
I mean,
I hear you about the centrist party.

1536
01:08:00,631 --> 01:08:01,580
That would be great.
But there's,

1537
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:02,170
you know,
I mean,

1538
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:07,220
the way the power structure works,
the way the cartels work is they got 

1539
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:07,220
all,
they have access to all the funds,

1540
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:07,560
right?
All the money,

1541
01:08:07,561 --> 01:08:08,160
right?
Where you,

1542
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,560
where do you,
where do you get the money for something

1543
01:08:10,561 --> 01:08:14,400
like that.
You need to build something from scratch

1544
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,010
and get to speed and in

1545
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,480
time to win an election,
that's very,

1546
01:08:17,481 --> 01:08:19,550
very hard to do.
But at the very least,

1547
01:08:19,551 --> 01:08:21,950
I mean,
a centrist party could fall prey to that

1548
01:08:21,951 --> 01:08:24,070
kind of toxic rhetoric as well.
I mean,

1549
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:27,920
but I feel like there should be norms 
where freedom of speech is an absolute.

1550
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:29,000
I mean,
we get it,

1551
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:34,280
but that the parties don't.
They have a moral obligation to denounce

1552
01:08:34,281 --> 01:08:38,570
things that they know undermine than 
unity of this country.

1553
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:41,720
I don't mean people in disagreement with
one another.

1554
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:46,730
I mean a basic level of respect for the 
other person's personhood,

1555
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:51,790
for their citizenship,
for their right to participate in the 

1556
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:54,251
democratic process.
And when somebody accuses the president 

1557
01:08:54,251 --> 01:08:54,251
of not being a citizen of the US,
they're basically saying,

1558
01:08:54,251 --> 01:08:56,450
I don't respect the system.
Uh,

1559
01:08:56,650 --> 01:08:57,250
like I,
I,

1560
01:08:57,290 --> 01:09:00,830
I,
I think the entire system is a lie and,

1561
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:05,950
and,
and I don't even think Donald Trump 

1562
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:05,950
thought it was true.

1563
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:09,850
I think it was a tactic and that the gop
never called that out is really 

1564
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:13,390
shameful.
You don't think he thought it was true 

1565
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:14,951
that the Obama was actually born in 
Kenya because I think he did because I 

1566
01:09:14,951 --> 01:09:19,571
know that he's really good friends with 
Alex Jones and talks to him all the 

1567
01:09:19,571 --> 01:09:22,631
time.
I think he believes a lot of very wacky 

1568
01:09:22,631 --> 01:09:22,631
conspiracy,
you know,

1569
01:09:22,631 --> 01:09:22,631
I think he starts out believing that,
but I,

1570
01:09:22,631 --> 01:09:23,180
by the end,
I mean,

1571
01:09:23,181 --> 01:09:23,690
does he,
I mean,

1572
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,790
did he,
did,

1573
01:09:25,791 --> 01:09:29,330
he did it for seven years.
So many people did believe it though.

1574
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:30,060
I know,
but he.

1575
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:32,390
But the thing is he was doing something 
that worked.

1576
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:37,420
He's a pragmatist.
One of the things I really like about 

1577
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:37,420
him in a way,
I mean I hate,

1578
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:39,320
I find him sort of a moral in the way 
that it gives me the chills,

1579
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:41,540
but he's also a pragmatist,
right?

1580
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:46,720
So I think he's completely capable of 
advocating a position that he doesn't 

1581
01:09:47,211 --> 01:09:52,211
believe in,
but I don't think he needs to believe 

1582
01:09:52,211 --> 01:09:52,211
in.
He's like,

1583
01:09:52,211 --> 01:09:52,211
enough people believe in this,
that this is working for me.

1584
01:09:52,211 --> 01:09:54,380
What was the benefit for him even 
chasing that idea down?

1585
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:59,620
I mean,
he wasn't running for president back 

1586
01:09:59,620 --> 01:09:59,620
then,
do you think he was thinking?

1587
01:09:59,620 --> 01:09:59,620
I think he's been on it.
I think he was considering it for a long

1588
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:04,571
time.
So he was doing it to sort of 

1589
01:10:04,571 --> 01:10:04,571
deteriorate to Democratic Party.
Yeah.

1590
01:10:04,571 --> 01:10:04,571
And Yeah.
And to see,

1591
01:10:04,571 --> 01:10:06,600
see if this immigration stuff also,
man,

1592
01:10:06,601 --> 01:10:08,060
I,
I mean maybe he believes in that stuff,

1593
01:10:08,061 --> 01:10:08,960
maybe he doesn't,
but it doesn't,

1594
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:13,990
it doesn't matter what he figured out 
very astutely as he identified a 

1595
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:17,570
democratic demographic that feels like 
the country's getting overrun by 

1596
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:17,930
immigrants.
Right.

1597
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,030
And you know,
statistics don't bear that out,

1598
01:10:20,031 --> 01:10:22,370
but people feel that way and people feel
that way.

1599
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:24,230
They vote that way and he figured that 
out.

1600
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,730
Right.
And so,

1601
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:27,730
I mean,
more power to it,

1602
01:10:27,731 --> 01:10:28,250
right?
Like,

1603
01:10:28,251 --> 01:10:30,260
I mean I'm,
I'm not questioning his.

1604
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:33,110
I mean it worked for him.
Right.

1605
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:35,770
But the only thing that I would say is 
like,

1606
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:40,840
please don't say anything,
that I'm undermines the nation's sense 

1607
01:10:41,421 --> 01:10:42,610
of unity.
Right.

1608
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:44,120
You know,
that's the crucial thing.

1609
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:49,150
That's the thing that's keeping us safe 
in the world is that we're a unified 

1610
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:50,120
country.
And when you disparage the courts,

1611
01:10:50,121 --> 01:10:52,820
for example,
you're splitting the country apart,

1612
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:55,940
then the intelligence agencies don't do 
it.

1613
01:10:56,130 --> 01:11:01,130
Right.
I think you're drilling holes in your 

1614
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:01,130
own boat,
man.

1615
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:01,330
Are you astonished that all that works,
that he can do that,

1616
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:03,220
that he can disparage the intelligence 
communities,

1617
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:06,050
that he could disparage the courts and 
that no one calls him out.

1618
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:08,540
No one says this is fucking outrageous.
This is stupid.

1619
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:13,980
Especially knowing all of his campaigns 
ties to Russia that are coming out

1620
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,300
now.
Even more so.

1621
01:11:15,330 --> 01:11:15,810
Well,
listen,

1622
01:11:15,811 --> 01:11:16,190
I mean,
I,

1623
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:21,240
some processes happening that will 
eventually catch up with him.

1624
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:22,210
Like,
I mean I,

1625
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:24,150
I mean,
I don't know how it's gonna turn out.

1626
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,080
Am I surprised?
Yes,

1627
01:11:25,081 --> 01:11:25,920
of course.
I'm surprised.

1628
01:11:25,921 --> 01:11:30,090
I'm also surprised that the Democrats 
that,

1629
01:11:30,091 --> 01:11:35,091
you know,
within my lifetime went from being a 

1630
01:11:35,091 --> 01:11:35,091
party that was deeply concerned with the
poor,

1631
01:11:35,091 --> 01:11:36,930
with the working poor,
uh,

1632
01:11:36,931 --> 01:11:37,690
with,
with,

1633
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:40,550
with people working in factories.
You know what I mean?

1634
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:42,780
Those are at least the highest ideals,
right?

1635
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:48,140
In my lifetime they went to,
they became a completely elitist 

1636
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:51,741
organization.
They didn't give a shit about those 

1637
01:11:51,741 --> 01:11:51,741
people.
Right.

1638
01:11:51,741 --> 01:11:52,380
So,
like that surprises me too.

1639
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,630
Right?
So along comes Bernie Sanders who,

1640
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:55,380
whatever,
you know,

1641
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:56,450
whatever his issues,
he's,

1642
01:11:56,451 --> 01:11:58,830
he's least sincere,
you know what I mean?

1643
01:11:58,831 --> 01:12:01,380
At least you trust the guy like that guy
speaking his mind.

1644
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:07,190
And the thing about Donald Trump,
he's speaking his mind like he's not 

1645
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:07,190
trying to,
he's not,

1646
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:10,020
doesn't have these awful poll tested 
opinions like Hillary did and Jeb did.

1647
01:12:10,021 --> 01:12:11,520
And all those guys like,
he's like,

1648
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:11,860
no,
no,

1649
01:12:11,861 --> 01:12:13,140
no.
This is what I think.

1650
01:12:13,141 --> 01:12:14,880
I don't care how people,
you know,

1651
01:12:14,881 --> 01:12:17,490
how people react on this is as Martin 
Luther said,

1652
01:12:17,491 --> 01:12:19,080
here I stand for,
I can do no other.

1653
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:21,360
You know,
a lot of places that trump stands,

1654
01:12:21,361 --> 01:12:23,010
I don't agree with,
but I actually,

1655
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:28,160
I'm actually impressed by his ability to
say something no matter what the 

1656
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:28,160
repercussions.
This is kind of cool.

1657
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,070
Well,
it is definitely a first,

1658
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:30,930
you know,
I mean he's,

1659
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:36,170
I mean at the debate when he was talking
to Hillary Clinton and I forget what 

1660
01:12:36,170 --> 01:12:36,900
exactly what you said,
you know,

1661
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:39,600
uh,
and he said because you'd be in jail and

1662
01:12:39,601 --> 01:12:40,650
the whole place went crazy.

1663
01:12:40,650 --> 01:12:43,320
Like who the fuck has ever done that?
It doesn't central debate.

1664
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:45,270
It's amazing in a work that I,
you know,

1665
01:12:45,271 --> 01:12:48,660
like my house kind of off to.
Although I disagree with him.

1666
01:12:48,661 --> 01:12:51,390
I'm almost every political point that he
says he holds.

1667
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:53,340
But I,
but I got to say like,

1668
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,700
like it worked and he,
I wrote an essay and I was talking about

1669
01:12:56,701 --> 01:13:00,030
different kinds of courage and you know,
this sort of physical courage,

1670
01:13:00,031 --> 01:13:00,740
right?
And,

1671
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:05,830
and I mean lives are literally being 
courageous in the face of harm to your 

1672
01:13:05,830 --> 01:13:06,870
body.
And I feel like trump is,

1673
01:13:06,871 --> 01:13:11,871
you know,
he's a bit of a bully and I think that 

1674
01:13:11,871 --> 01:13:11,871
to me,
bullies and cowards are sort of the same

1675
01:13:11,871 --> 01:13:11,871
thing,
right?

1676
01:13:11,871 --> 01:13:13,690
They're just two different sides of the 
same character trait.

1677
01:13:14,110 --> 01:13:15,660
And I said,
but that's not all trump is.

1678
01:13:15,661 --> 01:13:20,460
He's actually morally,
he's actually very courageous.

1679
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,390
Like he's not a moral coward.
He will say exactly what he thinks,

1680
01:13:24,391 --> 01:13:26,580
no matter what the opinion's going to 
be.

1681
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,420
He has extreme confidence in who he is 
or he doesn't give a shit,

1682
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:30,720
you know?
I mean,

1683
01:13:30,750 --> 01:13:35,750
that's moral courage.
It like this is what I believe and I'm 

1684
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:35,750
going to say it.
I don't care if I don't win,

1685
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:37,500
I don't care if I go to jail,
here I stand for,

1686
01:13:37,501 --> 01:13:42,501
I can do no other Martin simply could 
have is elitist mentality because he 

1687
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:46,130
does believe that he's above a lot of 
the repercussions for saying these 

1688
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:47,130
things.
But a lot of people who are elitists are

1689
01:13:47,131 --> 01:13:52,131
cowards and this thing.
And I disagree with trump on just about 

1690
01:13:52,131 --> 01:13:52,131
all of his policies,
right?

1691
01:13:52,131 --> 01:13:54,900
But the thing I do kind of have to tip 
my hat to his head.

1692
01:13:54,901 --> 01:13:56,410
He's not a moral coward.
He works.

1693
01:13:56,490 --> 01:13:59,430
He will say thing that every political 
pundit in the world will say,

1694
01:13:59,431 --> 01:14:00,180
no,
that's going to get,

1695
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:05,240
that's going to destroy you.
You're going to attack John Mccain and 

1696
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,620
you're gonna hope to win the Republican 
nomination and you're fucking crazy.

1697
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:12,520
And he did it and it works.
But he attacked him for being captured.

1698
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:14,290
I know,
which is insane.

1699
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:17,530
And I think trump truly feels that way 
and I don't agree with them.

1700
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:21,700
But I do respect the fact that he said 
it in the face of all political advice.

1701
01:14:21,701 --> 01:14:23,680
He didn't give a shit.
He said it because he believed it.

1702
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:26,650
That's moral courage.
I just disagree with his opinions.

1703
01:14:26,651 --> 01:14:29,680
But I that moral courage,
very few people have it.

1704
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:34,810
He has it and I just,
I wish he used it to unify the country 

1705
01:14:35,290 --> 01:14:40,290
and he's still splitting the country.
And that thing has any desire to unify 

1706
01:14:40,290 --> 01:14:40,720
the country.
Very self serving.

1707
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:41,800
I agree.
And I,

1708
01:14:41,801 --> 01:14:43,330
you know,
I don't think hilary did either,

1709
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:44,300
you know,
and none.

1710
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:49,440
You know what I mean,
and that's the problem with our pool 

1711
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:49,750
parties right now is that they're 
serving themselves before they serve the

1712
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:50,490
country.
Well,

1713
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:55,680
I think it speaks to what you're talking
about in your book that no one is 

1714
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,130
looking at this like a real tribe and 
uh,

1715
01:14:57,550 --> 01:15:02,550
an enormous tribe of 350 million people,
but there's no one person that's 

1716
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:05,830
standing out as a real leader and at 
least what Obama was,

1717
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:10,940
I mean,
whether you agree with his policies and 

1718
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:13,231
there's a lot that I don't agree with is
particularly in where the way flip 

1719
01:15:13,231 --> 01:15:14,770
flopped about whistleblowers and freedom
of the press,

1720
01:15:14,771 --> 01:15:18,010
those things disturb me greatly because 
I know how intelligent he is.

1721
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:20,920
I know he's a lawyer.
He was a statesman though.

1722
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:25,950
I mean,
he really came across as a guy who you 

1723
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:25,950
go,
oh,

1724
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:28,891
well that,
that guy should be the fucking 

1725
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:28,891
president.
He sounds like the president.

1726
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:28,891
He's,
he's,

1727
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:32,890
he has a fantastic vocabulary.
He speaks clearly.

1728
01:15:33,150 --> 01:15:35,080
He,
he's a very,

1729
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:39,310
he's a highly honed human being.
That's right.

1730
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:40,360
That's right.
No,

1731
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:41,050
no,
I agree.

1732
01:15:41,051 --> 01:15:41,500
And I,
you know,

1733
01:15:41,501 --> 01:15:44,240
there are things I didn't like whatever 
that about him,

1734
01:15:44,241 --> 01:15:45,620
but,
but absolutely as a,

1735
01:15:45,621 --> 01:15:48,010
as a person,
I mean he brought a huge,

1736
01:15:48,011 --> 01:15:52,180
I thought he brought a huge sort of 
gravitas and dignity to the office.

1737
01:15:52,181 --> 01:15:53,200
Dignity.
Yes,

1738
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:58,260
definitely without a doubt.
He mean he was probably one of the best 

1739
01:15:58,260 --> 01:15:59,500
ever at that.
But I think that what we need now,

1740
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:04,600
um,
is someone who genuinely wants to help 

1741
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:08,491
the country be unified.
Someone who genuinely wants to help the 

1742
01:16:08,491 --> 01:16:08,980
country,
not help their party,

1743
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:10,930
not,
not help themselves,

1744
01:16:10,931 --> 01:16:11,890
not just think,
well,

1745
01:16:11,891 --> 01:16:12,910
hey,
when this is all done,

1746
01:16:12,911 --> 01:16:17,911
I'm going to make a fucking million 
dollars a year doing speaking fees or 

1747
01:16:17,911 --> 01:16:22,171
whatever,
however much they make when they do 

1748
01:16:22,171 --> 01:16:22,171
that.

1749
01:16:22,171 --> 01:16:22,171
Well,
yeah,

1750
01:16:22,171 --> 01:16:22,880
and you're going to,
I mean we're,

1751
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:26,800
I mean we need that to stay to remain a 
country.

1752
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:27,730
Yeah,
right.

1753
01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:29,660
I mean like,
I mean,

1754
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:31,840
it really is headed towards a bad place 
I think.

1755
01:16:31,870 --> 01:16:36,870
And so that person is going to have to 
overcome the sort of reflexive reaction 

1756
01:16:40,601 --> 01:16:41,650
of the left wing.
You know,

1757
01:16:41,651 --> 01:16:46,651
he's not my president.
And the reflexive reaction of the right 

1758
01:16:46,651 --> 01:16:50,281
wing,
the right wing hated Obama in ways that 

1759
01:16:50,281 --> 01:16:51,010
were completely out of proportion to 
Obama's actual policies.

1760
01:16:51,490 --> 01:16:53,530
And you know,
what Mitch Mcconnell said,

1761
01:16:53,531 --> 01:16:55,630
you know,
the Republicans job in Congress,

1762
01:16:55,720 --> 01:17:00,720
their foremost job is to make sure that 
Barack Obama is a complete failure as a 

1763
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:04,030
president like it that's not serving the
country,

1764
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:04,960
not at all.
Right?

1765
01:17:04,961 --> 01:17:09,961
So,
so you need a leader who is actually 

1766
01:17:09,961 --> 01:17:10,160
able to overcome that toxic thinking

1767
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,660
in both parties,
right?

1768
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:13,550
Right.
I mean,

1769
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:18,110
who is Jesus coming back like,
I know who's going to do this,

1770
01:17:18,330 --> 01:17:23,330
who is going to do this?
But I think the start is a bipartisan 

1771
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:23,330
commission that starts to call people 
out.

1772
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:24,500
Right?
So you,

1773
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:27,890
you have Republicans calling Republicans
out because they're on this commission.

1774
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:29,540
Do you have Democrats Calling Democrats 
out?

1775
01:17:29,541 --> 01:17:34,541
You need it.
You got the free speech to make a fool 

1776
01:17:34,541 --> 01:17:34,541
of yourself,
go for it.

1777
01:17:34,541 --> 01:17:38,690
But you're not going to undermine this 
country without being called out by this

1778
01:17:38,691 --> 01:17:40,190
commission.
And um,

1779
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:44,690
and I was talking with someone in 
government pretty high up about this and

1780
01:17:44,691 --> 01:17:45,290
I said,
you know,

1781
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:50,660
I had sent my thing,
you'll bullets aren't going to destroy 

1782
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:50,660
this country,
okay,

1783
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:50,850
is never going to destroy this country,
um,

1784
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:55,940
but our own words we'll can destroy our 
democracy like that actually could do it

1785
01:17:55,941 --> 01:17:57,140
if we play this hand drawn.

1786
01:17:57,610 --> 01:18:02,610
And I said,
that makes partisan rhetoric actually a 

1787
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:04,730
matter of national security.
And when you can think about as an think

1788
01:18:04,731 --> 01:18:09,731
about it as a national security concern,
then you actually have a sort of 

1789
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:12,950
political and legal basis for forming a 
commission that addresses it.

1790
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:15,740
And I really truly think that should 
happen.

1791
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:18,770
And if it doesn't,
hopefully something else will happen.

1792
01:18:18,771 --> 01:18:23,771
That works.
But it's the only thing I can think of 

1793
01:18:23,771 --> 01:18:23,771
that will begin to address that,
that can,

1794
01:18:23,930 --> 01:18:28,340
that can rise up above the partisan 
interest of both parties because those,

1795
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:31,460
the parties clearly don't seem capable 
of doing it on their own.

1796
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:33,560
Now when you write a book,
like try,

1797
01:18:33,561 --> 01:18:38,561
when you outline all these issues that 
people have and all these issues 

1798
01:18:38,561 --> 01:18:41,651
historically that people have had,
do you try to consider a solution?

1799
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:42,590
I mean,
do you,

1800
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:44,030
do you have a solution?

1801
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:47,120
Are you just examining all the various 
problems that we have?

1802
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:53,120
So I mean tribe was me trying to make 
sense of sort of what ails us,

1803
01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:57,110
starting with,
you know,

1804
01:18:57,470 --> 01:19:02,470
people hemorrhaging off the frontier to 
the American Indians and on up to the 

1805
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:04,040
soldiers.
I was with mass shootings,

1806
01:19:04,041 --> 01:19:04,990
you know,
something's,

1807
01:19:05,350 --> 01:19:06,770
something's not working for us.
Right?

1808
01:19:06,910 --> 01:19:09,580
What?
So it was foremost in analysis.

1809
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:12,440
Um,
and towards the end,

1810
01:19:12,810 --> 01:19:17,810
um,
I talked a little bit about solutions 

1811
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:19,220
and one of the solutions I talked about 
was making a concerted effort to get rid

1812
01:19:19,221 --> 01:19:21,620
of contemptuous partisan rhetoric in 
government.

1813
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:25,670
And I really felt that that trickles 
down and pollutes,

1814
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:29,210
it pollutes the water stream down,
like downstream.

1815
01:19:29,211 --> 01:19:34,211
It pollutes everything so that everyone 
all as citizens are drinking toxic 

1816
01:19:34,211 --> 01:19:35,270
water.
Um,

1817
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:40,600
from,
from that rhetoric and wondering if the 

1818
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:41,570
unity can survive,
like will this will the center hold?

1819
01:19:42,450 --> 01:19:43,190
Um,
you know,

1820
01:19:43,191 --> 01:19:48,191
you hear your parents screaming at each 
other in the bedroom and saying 

1821
01:19:48,191 --> 01:19:48,620
unforgivable things to each other as a 
child,

1822
01:19:48,621 --> 01:19:49,880
you might rightly think,
wow,

1823
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:52,550
this marriage isn't lasting in this 
family is not lasting.

1824
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:55,460
That's how it feels to be a citizen of 
the United States right now.

1825
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,200
Like mom and dad are screaming at each 
other.

1826
01:19:57,201 --> 01:20:01,070
And so I talked about contempt,
disagree.

1827
01:20:01,071 --> 01:20:06,071
If you want,
don't speak with contempt about someone 

1828
01:20:06,071 --> 01:20:09,011
you share a combat outpost width and 
that's what this country potentially as 

1829
01:20:09,011 --> 01:20:09,011
don't you think also

1830
01:20:09,011 --> 01:20:13,490
with the mom and dad analogy that it 
also shows you how to behave in your own

1831
01:20:14,341 --> 01:20:19,341
life.
And I think that's one of the things 

1832
01:20:19,341 --> 01:20:20,871
that's really important about the 
president is the president does sort of 

1833
01:20:20,871 --> 01:20:21,570
represent the best example of what we 
can be.

1834
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,310
When we were kids growing up,
that was the thing,

1835
01:20:23,311 --> 01:20:25,170
like he asked the kid what they want to 
be.

1836
01:20:25,171 --> 01:20:26,710
If someone said,
I want to be president,

1837
01:20:26,711 --> 01:20:27,810
and were like,
Holy Shit,

1838
01:20:27,811 --> 01:20:30,960
you're really going for a kid.
You want to be the biggest job.

1839
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:34,830
That's the number one position.
So you're supposed to be the best person

1840
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:39,831
ever,
which is why we hold someone to such an 

1841
01:20:39,831 --> 01:20:41,631
incredible microscope,
which is almost even more impressive 

1842
01:20:41,631 --> 01:20:44,541
that trump won after that,
grab the pussy audio recording and that 

1843
01:20:44,541 --> 01:20:46,050
he could just brush that off as locker 
room talk.

1844
01:20:46,510 --> 01:20:47,670
It's right in a way.

1845
01:20:47,670 --> 01:20:48,630
He's kind of right.
I mean,

1846
01:20:48,631 --> 01:20:53,631
it really is kind of fucked up that they
did try to use that on them and pull it 

1847
01:20:53,631 --> 01:20:57,531
out the last minute.
But it does give you also an 

1848
01:20:57,531 --> 01:20:57,960
understanding of how he thinks and 
behaves when no one's around.

1849
01:20:58,530 --> 01:20:59,040
Right?
I mean,

1850
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:04,250
you know,
my problem with him was that I like if I

1851
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:07,880
look at the worst of his behavior,
um,

1852
01:21:07,910 --> 01:21:12,910
I mean people sent society says people 
to jail for the worst thing that they 

1853
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:16,521
did.
So it is actually legitimate to judge 

1854
01:21:16,521 --> 01:21:17,130
people's worst behavior and evaluate 
them on that basis.

1855
01:21:17,131 --> 01:21:20,280
So if I look at the wharf,
look at the worst of his behavior,

1856
01:21:20,281 --> 01:21:25,281
even if I was a diehard Republican who,
who adhere to all of the things he says 

1857
01:21:25,281 --> 01:21:29,271
he believes it.
If I looked at the worst of his 

1858
01:21:29,271 --> 01:21:29,271
behavior,
a mocking a gold star family,

1859
01:21:29,810 --> 01:21:33,570
like mocking a disabled person that 
wasn't real though,

1860
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,420
you know that mocking a disabled person 
was sort of trumped up.

1861
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:41,600
He does hate to use that word trump cup.
He does that when he's talking about 

1862
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,710
anyone.
Like when you asked flustered like,

1863
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:45,150
oh,
what are you going to do here?

1864
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:51,210
Like that they tried to say that he was 
mocking a reporter that it was disabled,

1865
01:21:51,211 --> 01:21:53,400
but it's pretty clear that that's not 
right.

1866
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:54,600
Well,
I mean maybe so,

1867
01:21:54,601 --> 01:21:59,601
but with a,
with a question from someone who's 

1868
01:21:59,601 --> 01:21:59,601
visibly disabled,
maybe you just don't do that.

1869
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:02,460
You know what I mean?
Like each pattern it does.

1870
01:22:02,510 --> 01:22:07,510
Well maybe,
but maybe I'm giving him more of the 

1871
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:09,381
benefit of the doubt that I should.
But if it was the only example that I 

1872
01:22:09,381 --> 01:22:09,710
wouldn't be thinking about it,
but there is a sort of pattern that,

1873
01:22:09,711 --> 01:22:14,711
that,
that model from Mexico who gained some 

1874
01:22:14,711 --> 01:22:17,250
weight that he was walking.
I mean like the mockery of less powerful

1875
01:22:17,251 --> 01:22:18,510
people is sort of endless.

1876
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:21,990
And so to me,
I wouldn't,

1877
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:24,420
I wouldn't have that person at my dinner
table,

1878
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:27,930
you know what I mean?
Like I just with my close friends,

1879
01:22:27,931 --> 01:22:30,090
like someone who was acting like that,
he started acting,

1880
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:34,710
started doing that and my dinner table,
I'd walk around,

1881
01:22:34,770 --> 01:22:37,560
I get up and walk around the table,
put them in a headlock,

1882
01:22:37,690 --> 01:22:39,550
I think drag him out of my house.
Right,

1883
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:44,760
right.
I don't want to think that about my 

1884
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:44,760
president.
I want my president to be someone I'd be

1885
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,490
like glad to have at my dinner table.
I would,

1886
01:22:46,491 --> 01:22:48,630
would've.
I didn't vote for George Bush by love to

1887
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:49,980
have that guy.
I had dinner table,

1888
01:22:50,010 --> 01:22:51,720
Ronald Reagan.
Did you know what I mean?

1889
01:22:51,721 --> 01:22:53,480
Like he's the first president and be 
like,

1890
01:22:53,490 --> 01:22:58,490
no man,
I don't want to subject my bi friends 

1891
01:22:58,490 --> 01:23:01,550
too that you ever read rudy errol woody 
Harrelson's account of a dinner that he 

1892
01:23:01,550 --> 01:23:05,691
had with trump.
He said literally had to get up in the 

1893
01:23:05,691 --> 01:23:05,970
middle and go outside and smoke a joint 
just to just

1894
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:07,450
relax himself.
Yeah.

1895
01:23:07,451 --> 01:23:09,750
I was talking about,
I think you said early 2000.

1896
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:14,820
He had a dinner with trump.
And he said he never met someone so 

1897
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:14,830
narcissistic,
so self obsessed.

1898
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,240
Yeah.
And you know,

1899
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:16,750
the,
you know,

1900
01:23:16,770 --> 01:23:21,770
my worry like in this conversation is 
that it will somehow seem partisan and 

1901
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:24,720
like I will be saying the same things if
trump were a democrat,

1902
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:27,650
something about George Bush that you'd 
be happy to have him over.

1903
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:32,710
And I just think,
I hope that what comes out of this is 

1904
01:23:32,710 --> 01:23:33,920
that a hero will rise and that someone 
will.

1905
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:36,830
Someone who's really legitimately good 
person will say,

1906
01:23:36,831 --> 01:23:37,540
look,
this is a,

1907
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:43,000
this is a fucking travis day.
Like someone who actually could assume 

1908
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,351
the role correctly will step into place.
And it was see that very clearly in 

1909
01:23:47,351 --> 01:23:47,840
comparison.
Right.

1910
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:49,840
Well what I mean,
do you get back to your question?

1911
01:23:49,841 --> 01:23:52,090
One of the solutions that I talk about 
it,

1912
01:23:52,091 --> 01:23:54,830
it's not in my book,
I talk about this.

1913
01:23:54,831 --> 01:23:58,100
This is national compulsory national 
service with a,

1914
01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:03,140
with a military option.
And in the your question was how do we 

1915
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:03,790
make this nation feel like a nation?
Right.

1916
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:09,060
And the problem psychologist will tell 
you that the more you sacrifice for 

1917
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:10,180
something,
the more you value it.

1918
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:13,780
And if you're part of something that 
doesn't require any sacrifice at all,

1919
01:24:13,781 --> 01:24:15,810
you just don't value it very highly.
Right.

1920
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:20,470
The advantage of national service it,
and I don't mean the draft,

1921
01:24:20,830 --> 01:24:25,830
I think I don't mean military service.
I mean national service with a military 

1922
01:24:25,830 --> 01:24:30,091
option.
I don't think it's moral to force 

1923
01:24:30,091 --> 01:24:30,091
someone to fight a war that they don't 
believe it.

1924
01:24:30,091 --> 01:24:30,430
But what sort of service which,
you know,

1925
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:31,690
whatever,
whatever it is,

1926
01:24:31,691 --> 01:24:33,540
the nation needs a lot of stuff done 
right.

1927
01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:37,690
And whatever that may be.
But the point of it is,

1928
01:24:38,110 --> 01:24:41,050
so if you had a military option,
but otherwise you could teach in schools

1929
01:24:41,051 --> 01:24:46,051
otherwise you could dig ditches.
I don't whatever the nation needs done 

1930
01:24:46,051 --> 01:24:48,100
this work,
this core of workers at 22,

1931
01:24:48,101 --> 01:24:51,480
23 years old does it for a year.
My first wife was from,

1932
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:55,450
from the eastern,
from eastern Europe and the young people

1933
01:24:56,540 --> 01:25:01,540
formed work brigades in the summer and 
help harvest like harvest wheat and 

1934
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:03,730
stuff like that was what she did when 
she was a teenage girl.

1935
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:08,820
And it was incredibly good for the kids 
over there and it made them feel like 

1936
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:09,750
they're part of something.
Right.

1937
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:13,930
And so what I would say,
there's a downside to national service,

1938
01:25:13,931 --> 01:25:16,060
which is the government's telling people
what to do.

1939
01:25:16,090 --> 01:25:21,090
Of course there's also an upside,
which is it makes everyone feel like 

1940
01:25:21,090 --> 01:25:24,661
they're part of this thing called the 
United States and it puts white people 

1941
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:25,080
and black people enrich and poured.

1942
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:30,090
Everyone,
puts them all in one big pot and stirs 

1943
01:25:30,090 --> 01:25:30,090
them up just like the military does.
And they get to know each other.

1944
01:25:30,090 --> 01:25:34,270
And so everything's is an upside and a 
downside to everything.

1945
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:39,420
Right?
So national service has a very obvious 

1946
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:39,420
downside,
but the upside isn't discussed much,

1947
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:43,030
which is that it creates an American 
identity,

1948
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:48,840
a shared experience that all Americans 
have that like in Israel is compulsory 

1949
01:25:49,211 --> 01:25:53,170
service and that that is a common ground
that every single Israeli has,

1950
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:58,680
whatever,
wherever they fall in the political 

1951
01:25:58,680 --> 01:25:58,680
spectrum,
they all have that shared experience and

1952
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:02,020
it's an enormously potent thing in that 
country.

1953
01:26:02,021 --> 01:26:03,980
Keeping it bound together.
And this country I

1954
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:05,930
think needs something like that.
I think it would be very,

1955
01:26:05,931 --> 01:26:08,030
very helpful.
Well,

1956
01:26:08,031 --> 01:26:12,230
it'd be nice if people did have some.
I mean if you,

1957
01:26:12,231 --> 01:26:16,250
if you use some sort of connection to 
what it takes to keep things running,

1958
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:19,130
whether it's help fix the streets,
whether it's,

1959
01:26:19,490 --> 01:26:20,630
you know,
help do something.

1960
01:26:20,631 --> 01:26:25,631
But the problem that I would have it 
probably I would have with it is the 

1961
01:26:25,631 --> 01:26:30,281
idea that someone from the government 
would be able to require you to do 

1962
01:26:30,281 --> 01:26:33,581
something and that if you didn't do it,
they could treat you the same way the 

1963
01:26:33,581 --> 01:26:33,581
irs treats you.
If you don't pay your taxes,

1964
01:26:33,581 --> 01:26:35,990
I just lock you in a cage,
which is.

1965
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:37,200
Well,
I mean one made,

1966
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:41,150
one way to do it might be to incentivize
it by sort of making it mandatory,

1967
01:26:41,151 --> 01:26:45,230
incentivizing it by giving people really
large tax breaks for doing it.

1968
01:26:45,470 --> 01:26:50,470
Yeah,
but young people aren't going to think 

1969
01:26:50,470 --> 01:26:50,470
about tax breaks.
They're going to think about,

1970
01:26:50,470 --> 01:26:53,081
fuck that man,
I want to skateboard or I don't want to 

1971
01:26:53,081 --> 01:26:53,081
go,
all right.

1972
01:26:53,081 --> 01:26:53,081
Then they have to listen to me.
Listen,

1973
01:26:53,081 --> 01:26:57,791
for most of this nation's history,
we've had a draft as the government 

1974
01:26:57,791 --> 01:26:57,791
telling people what to do.
Right?

1975
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:00,230
And likewise with taxes,
you don't pay your taxes,

1976
01:27:00,231 --> 01:27:01,940
you go to jail.
Like I mean the government does,

1977
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:07,340
the government puts red lights and 
intersections and you have to fucking 

1978
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:07,340
stop.
I agree.

1979
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:09,980
But to try to do that today,
it'd be extremely difficult.

1980
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:15,040
The distrust of the government is so 
high and if the government comes along 

1981
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,010
and says,
you have to do all these things and then

1982
01:27:16,011 --> 01:27:16,700
we go,
wait a minute,

1983
01:27:16,730 --> 01:27:19,190
are you doing these things?
Are you going to join the military?

1984
01:27:19,191 --> 01:27:21,230
You're 55 years old,
your senator,

1985
01:27:21,410 --> 01:27:24,860
are you going to go pick wheat or 
fucking fix the roads?

1986
01:27:24,890 --> 01:27:26,260
It definitely has to start.
I mean,

1987
01:27:26,270 --> 01:27:27,090
yeah,
you can't.

1988
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:29,870
You're not going to get 60 year olds and
in national service,

1989
01:27:29,871 --> 01:27:31,220
right?
They're already involved their lives.

1990
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,560
The great thing about 18,
19,

1991
01:27:33,561 --> 01:27:35,540
20 year olds,
22 year olds,

1992
01:27:35,541 --> 01:27:37,250
is that their lives haven't really 
started yet.

1993
01:27:37,251 --> 01:27:39,060
I mean that's why it works in Israel.
Yeah.

1994
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:42,110
So are people gonna object you?
Of course they are,

1995
01:27:42,111 --> 01:27:47,111
but the question is how do we unify this
country that the truth is like if we 

1996
01:27:47,111 --> 01:27:48,650
wanted to unify communities,
you'd been in the car,

1997
01:27:49,150 --> 01:27:49,940
right?
People can,

1998
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:54,970
you know they are living there spending 
their whole lives within walking 

1999
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:55,940
distance of their home that will,
that will unify communities.

2000
01:27:56,130 --> 01:28:01,130
We're just not willing to do that.
What will unify the country's national 

2001
01:28:01,130 --> 01:28:01,670
service?
We may not be willing to do it,

2002
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:05,180
but that's a different conversation from
would it work or not?

2003
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:06,830
My opinion is,
is that it would help.

2004
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:08,840
It's a good opinion.
I mean,

2005
01:28:08,841 --> 01:28:10,400
I,
I definitely see merit in it.

2006
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:15,420
I definitely think that would be 
something that would be a fascinating 

2007
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:18,341
debate to have back and forth.
I just wonder if people at any point in 

2008
01:28:18,341 --> 01:28:20,990
their lives today who would be willing 
to give up freedom for the government.

2009
01:28:20,991 --> 01:28:23,270
I think people are used to this kind of 
like free ride.

2010
01:28:23,271 --> 01:28:25,250
I pay my taxes and that's all you got 
from me.

2011
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:27,260
I don't have to vote.
I don't have to do anything.

2012
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,510
You know,
in Australia you have to vote and if you

2013
01:28:29,511 --> 01:28:31,390
don't vote you get fined.
Well that,

2014
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:33,530
you know,
that's what you said it right there.

2015
01:28:33,531 --> 01:28:35,960
That's the misconception.
It's not for the government,

2016
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:40,340
it's for your neighbor,
it's for your fellow citizens.

2017
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:43,670
Everything you pay your taxes,
not for the government.

2018
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:46,900
You pay your taxes for the country,
but you pay him to the Gulf,

2019
01:28:47,170 --> 01:28:47,780
to the government.

2020
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:52,780
There's no auditing of your taxes.
And I think that's one of the things 

2021
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:55,601
that freaks people out today.
Like you don't know where that money is 

2022
01:28:55,601 --> 01:28:58,151
going.
They don't have to tell you and if you 

2023
01:28:58,151 --> 01:28:58,151
don't give it to them,
they'll lock you up.

2024
01:28:58,151 --> 01:29:01,960
Right.
And that's the problem with a large 

2025
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:03,701
scale society is that collective effort.
It's not clear that that collective 

2026
01:29:03,701 --> 01:29:06,660
effort is going to the whole entity.
It looks like it's going to the tax man.

2027
01:29:06,930 --> 01:29:08,370
Right?
It's not.

2028
01:29:08,371 --> 01:29:09,810
I mean that's an illusion,
right.

2029
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:15,080
But I mean the check is to the irs,
the irs handed over to the government 

2030
01:29:15,091 --> 01:29:16,800
that that's then spends it on the 
country.

2031
01:29:16,801 --> 01:29:17,880
I mean,
that's the reality,

2032
01:29:17,881 --> 01:29:20,520
but it looks like the irs is oppressing 
you.

2033
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:25,760
Yeah,
but that's actually not what's 

2034
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:25,760
happening,
right?

2035
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,070
The irs is an arm of government that you
elected in.

2036
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:28,260
Right.
And it's been charged with getting,

2037
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:32,070
getting money from people like that's 
just the irs isn't doing anything.

2038
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:33,920
It was just like,
it's like Tsa ever.

2039
01:29:33,921 --> 01:29:38,921
I was standing in line at Tsa and 
someone was complaining about how long 

2040
01:29:38,921 --> 01:29:38,921
it was taking and,
and,

2041
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:41,610
and the guy next to her,
they didn't even know each other and the

2042
01:29:41,611 --> 01:29:43,020
guy next to her who said,
look,

2043
01:29:43,290 --> 01:29:46,560
they're not doing it for them.
They're doing it for us.

2044
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:48,750
Brian.
They're searching all our stuff.

2045
01:29:49,140 --> 01:29:50,910
They don't care.
Right.

2046
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:54,720
They're not on the damn plane.
They're searching our stuff for us.

2047
01:29:55,110 --> 01:29:58,530
Likewise with the government,
the government isn't doing it for itself

2048
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:00,240
is still new for us.
Right.

2049
01:30:00,241 --> 01:30:02,550
We like to think of it as one entity,
right.

2050
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:05,130
We like to think of the irs as the 
government,

2051
01:30:05,310 --> 01:30:06,720
you know,
they are collecting the money.

2052
01:30:06,721 --> 01:30:09,030
We almost think of it as them spending 
the money as well.

2053
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:14,270
We don't think of it.
It was distributing it to the rest of 

2054
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:14,270
the government.

2055
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:14,270
That's right.
Yeah,

2056
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:16,020
that's right.
So if you want to gin up as sort of like

2057
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:21,080
antigovernment screed,
like it's easy to play on that 

2058
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:21,080
misperception because it's an easy 
misperception to,

2059
01:30:21,330 --> 01:30:26,330
to have,
I mean you get a $200 parking ticket in 

2060
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:26,850
New York and he definitely feels like 
the parking bureau is like,

2061
01:30:27,430 --> 01:30:29,340
is,
is vengeful,

2062
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:30,390
is,
you know what I mean,

2063
01:30:30,391 --> 01:30:35,391
has targeted you personally as you're 
going to take your $200 and spend it on 

2064
01:30:35,391 --> 01:30:35,850
itself.
That's what it feels like.

2065
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:41,390
The truth is that that $200 paves the 
fills in the potholes that you're going 

2066
01:30:41,390 --> 01:30:43,020
to be driving across next year.
That's the truth of it,

2067
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:48,080
right?
You know what we're talking about 

2068
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:48,080
solutions for the woes of society in the
end,

2069
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:52,290
particularly the individual.
You have sort of found your own solution

2070
01:30:52,590 --> 01:30:57,590
in journalism and,
and embedded journalism in these very 

2071
01:30:57,590 --> 01:31:00,420
dangerous environments that this is how 
you have sort of reinforced your tribe.

2072
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:02,160
And you talk about that in the book 
about how,

2073
01:31:02,550 --> 01:31:03,170
you know,
uh,

2074
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:08,420
how well you slept in this very tight 
confines in these bases with all these,

2075
01:31:08,671 --> 01:31:13,671
like very loud snoring men.
But the fact that you guys were all 

2076
01:31:13,671 --> 01:31:16,140
together in this very hostile 
environment,

2077
01:31:16,190 --> 01:31:18,010
but that was your solution.
Well,

2078
01:31:18,110 --> 01:31:23,110
I mean,
there wasn't a solution in this 

2079
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:23,110
instance.
I mean,

2080
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:25,360
it wasn't a longterm solution,
but it did give me these experience of 

2081
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:25,390
sort of,
um,

2082
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:29,250
sort of shared a shared fate,
right?

2083
01:31:29,251 --> 01:31:30,630
I mean,
it's sort of collective effort,

2084
01:31:30,690 --> 01:31:32,130
right?
I was part of this group,

2085
01:31:32,650 --> 01:31:34,650
um,
and my,

2086
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:39,680
my,
my welfare was tied to the welfare of 

2087
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:42,621
the group.
My actions could help or hinder the 

2088
01:31:42,621 --> 01:31:45,141
group.
I was judged by how I behaved in the 

2089
01:31:45,141 --> 01:31:45,141
group.
Right.

2090
01:31:45,141 --> 01:31:46,680
And that's,
that's our evolutionary past.

2091
01:31:46,681 --> 01:31:48,390
And it felt great.
Right.

2092
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:50,460
And,
um,

2093
01:31:50,730 --> 01:31:51,900
so the,
you know,

2094
01:31:51,901 --> 01:31:53,190
the trick is we,
you know,

2095
01:31:53,191 --> 01:31:58,191
we live in a dispersed,
modern society where that's just not 

2096
01:31:58,191 --> 01:32:00,430
going to be the 20 hour a day reality

2097
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:04,210
for most people throughout their lives.
But it may not need to be,

2098
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:06,460
you may just need a little bit of it,
you know,

2099
01:32:06,461 --> 01:32:09,070
maybe you get a little bit of that sort 
of collective,

2100
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:13,660
the collective norm at the boxing gym,
you know,

2101
01:32:13,661 --> 01:32:15,610
maybe you get it in the military,
you know,

2102
01:32:15,611 --> 01:32:17,020
maybe you get it hunting,
you know,

2103
01:32:17,021 --> 01:32:19,930
whatever,
like there are ways to experience it and

2104
01:32:19,931 --> 01:32:23,500
maybe you just don't,
you maybe you get it a church in a.

2105
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:24,340
I mean,
I'm not religious,

2106
01:32:24,341 --> 01:32:24,940
but I,
I,

2107
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:30,030
I understand church to be a profoundly 
communal activity and so I'm not saying 

2108
01:32:31,181 --> 01:32:34,210
burn down that suburbs and bend the car,
although that would work pretty well.

2109
01:32:34,370 --> 01:32:39,370
Um,
maybe for your own personal sense of 

2110
01:32:39,370 --> 01:32:41,560
meaning and fulfillment in life.
Find,

2111
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:46,590
find that collective experience in 
little bits and pieces and the little 

2112
01:32:46,590 --> 01:32:47,790
goes a long way.
Yeah.

2113
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:50,170
And doing something and doing something 
difficult.

2114
01:32:50,170 --> 01:32:52,510
I think it's also very important.
Absolutely.

2115
01:32:52,511 --> 01:32:57,511
I mean getting together,
shoot pool with your buddies every 

2116
01:32:57,511 --> 01:32:57,511
Thursday night.
That's great.

2117
01:32:57,511 --> 01:32:59,620
But it's not quite.
We're talking about difficult things and

2118
01:32:59,621 --> 01:33:03,070
things that test you physically and 
mentally for some reason there.

2119
01:33:03,071 --> 01:33:05,860
Those seem to be a requirement for 
people and when people don't,

2120
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:09,880
don't fulfill that requirement.
It seems to me those are the people that

2121
01:33:09,881 --> 01:33:12,460
are most unhappy.
Yeah,

2122
01:33:12,461 --> 01:33:14,340
I mean the state there have to be stakes
involved.

2123
01:33:14,570 --> 01:33:19,570
Yes.
There are no stakes to pool to golf 

2124
01:33:19,570 --> 01:33:19,570
right there.
Pleasure gambling.

2125
01:33:19,570 --> 01:33:19,720
Right.
Right.

2126
01:33:19,721 --> 01:33:21,790
But that,
but that's not a collective,

2127
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:25,450
you know what I mean?
That's not a collective state and um,

2128
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:27,670
they're pleasant activities,
but what,

2129
01:33:27,671 --> 01:33:28,110
you know,
what,

2130
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:33,220
what reproduces our evolutionary past as
being in a small group where the stakes 

2131
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:36,910
are for the stakes are serious,
if not life and death,

2132
01:33:37,210 --> 01:33:38,830
but even,
even if it's not life and death,

2133
01:33:38,831 --> 01:33:40,930
at least they're real physical 
consequences.

2134
01:33:41,530 --> 01:33:44,290
And that collective action makes you 
more,

2135
01:33:44,330 --> 01:33:48,880
makes the group more able to navigate 
those adversities successfully.

2136
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:51,440
And when you do that,
um,

2137
01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:56,860
it is,
it's an intoxicating feeling is what 

2138
01:33:56,860 --> 01:33:59,971
we're wired for.
It's what we're missing in our sort of 

2139
01:33:59,971 --> 01:34:00,450
modern lives.
And you,

2140
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:05,580
you don't need,
you don't need a huge amount of it to 

2141
01:34:05,580 --> 01:34:08,790
feel better.
Another thing that seems to make people 

2142
01:34:08,790 --> 01:34:09,790
feel very fulfilled as creating things,
working with their hands,

2143
01:34:10,150 --> 01:34:12,690
creating anything,
whether it's furniture,

2144
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:14,830
art,
just making something,

2145
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:19,860
doing something where your mind is 
involved in natural task of bringing 

2146
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:21,700
forth something into existence that 
didn't exist before.

2147
01:34:21,730 --> 01:34:23,030
What we'll think about it.
I mean,

2148
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:24,850
again,
in terms of evolution,

2149
01:34:24,910 --> 01:34:29,910
if doing something successfully produces
a chemical reaction that feels good,

2150
01:34:30,620 --> 01:34:33,820
a little bit of dopamine or in terms of 
communal connection,

2151
01:34:33,821 --> 01:34:36,740
a little bit of Oxytocin,
the,

2152
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:39,250
the,
the trained monkey that we are,

2153
01:34:39,670 --> 01:34:40,750
we'll continue doing that.

2154
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:41,650
Good thing.
So,

2155
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:46,920
so basically the tasks that helped with 
survival get rewarded with 

2156
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:48,560
neurochemicals that feel good.
Yeah.

2157
01:34:48,730 --> 01:34:52,760
And the things that are dangerous to us,
uh,

2158
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:57,800
and,
and less than our chance for survival 

2159
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:58,670
don't feel good.
So being isolated,

2160
01:34:58,671 --> 01:35:03,671
being alienated from your group,
being an outcast feels bad and your 

2161
01:35:03,671 --> 01:35:05,930
survival chances go down,
right?

2162
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:09,650
You don't want to stay in that place.
You want to join the group again.

2163
01:35:09,651 --> 01:35:14,651
And so there's these neurochemical 
reward incentives and punishments that 

2164
01:35:14,651 --> 01:35:18,791
get heard.
People towards behaviors that help 

2165
01:35:18,791 --> 01:35:19,940
survival build,
doing things,

2166
01:35:19,941 --> 01:35:22,700
accomplishing things,
building things that all feels good.

2167
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:27,880
It's clearly what we needed to do in our
evolutionary past and is reinforced and 

2168
01:35:28,820 --> 01:35:33,050
creativity factors onto that.
How that like say like art,

2169
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:36,260
like painting or something like that.
Like there's something deeply satisfying

2170
01:35:36,261 --> 01:35:37,760
to people that are painters.
Well,

2171
01:35:37,761 --> 01:35:38,210
uh,
yeah,

2172
01:35:38,211 --> 01:35:39,920
and what they're.
I mean art,

2173
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,810
um,
they know from the,

2174
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:46,840
from the incredible paintings on the 
caves and in the caves in France and 

2175
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:51,371
Spain,
Lesko and the other caves that art is 

2176
01:35:51,371 --> 01:35:54,380
one of the things that's used to bind 
communities together in ceremonies.

2177
01:35:54,740 --> 01:35:55,880
I mean,
you can see you in church.

2178
01:35:55,910 --> 01:35:56,510
I mean,
there is no,

2179
01:35:56,540 --> 01:35:59,480
there is no church in the land that 
doesn't have art on the walls,

2180
01:35:59,830 --> 01:36:01,140
right?
Um,

2181
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:05,480
the depictions of Christ or whatever or 
what are the visual aids that helps bind

2182
01:36:05,481 --> 01:36:06,740
people into a group like,
oh,

2183
01:36:06,741 --> 01:36:08,180
we all believe in the same thing,
right?

2184
01:36:08,330 --> 01:36:12,500
So art is a great binding force.
Music is an incredible binding force.

2185
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:15,380
So rhythmic like rhythm and heavy 
drumming rhythm.

2186
01:36:15,381 --> 01:36:18,470
We'll get a whole group of people sort 
of moving in unison.

2187
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,890
And I'm,
Jonathan Haidt has talked about,

2188
01:36:22,450 --> 01:36:25,670
he talked about that sort of hive 
behavior and how it works and very,

2189
01:36:25,671 --> 01:36:28,730
very powerful.
So what I would say,

2190
01:36:28,731 --> 01:36:33,731
and I'm just guessing here,
but I would say is that the arch that 

2191
01:36:33,731 --> 01:36:36,341
are so intoxicating to be engaged in 
their survival value is that it makes 

2192
01:36:36,711 --> 01:36:39,080
the group cohere around a unified idea.

2193
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:43,670
And that music does that.
I'm the visual arts do that.

2194
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:46,240
Um,
the spoken word poetry song,

2195
01:36:46,250 --> 01:36:48,350
all those do that as well.
And so the,

2196
01:36:48,390 --> 01:36:51,740
you have a group of people that are 
there are unified on these all,

2197
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:54,860
all these different levels.
So what happens when the enemy comes,

2198
01:36:55,000 --> 01:37:00,000
I mean the music starts the sort of like
visual pageantry starts like you get,

2199
01:37:00,381 --> 01:37:01,070
you know,
like the,

2200
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:06,520
you know,
the war time posters showing heroic 

2201
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:06,520
soldiers with rifle and bayonet or you 
get the,

2202
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:06,830
the war art,
right?

2203
01:37:06,831 --> 01:37:10,640
You get the martial music,
all of that galvanizes the public spirit

2204
01:37:10,641 --> 01:37:12,830
to face the enemy and it works extremely
well.

2205
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:18,400
Wow.
So you think that that's one of the 

2206
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:18,400
reasons why art is so satisfying.
I mean,

2207
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:23,291
I just assume that our evolution has 
produced that anything that feels good 

2208
01:37:23,901 --> 01:37:28,490
to us had survival value in our past,
so of creating art feels good.

2209
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:34,420
That's because we are genetically 
predisposed towards doing things that 

2210
01:37:34,420 --> 01:37:36,230
bind the group together.
Generosity feels good,

2211
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:37,910
right?
If you walk down the street and you give

2212
01:37:37,911 --> 01:37:40,040
someone $5,
you just a random dude,

2213
01:37:40,041 --> 01:37:42,500
you just give them five bucks and you 
measure the.

2214
01:37:42,530 --> 01:37:45,080
The neurochemicals in his brain and your
brain,

2215
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:48,230
you get more of a high than he does.
Right?

2216
01:37:48,231 --> 01:37:53,231
So generosity feels good.
It's clearly adaptive and helps groups 

2217
01:37:53,231 --> 01:37:53,231
go here,
right?

2218
01:37:53,231 --> 01:37:55,500
Yeah.
And Art as well,

2219
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:58,530
so that art,
when you create something amazing,

2220
01:37:58,531 --> 01:38:00,660
what you're realizing is that someone's 
going to see that and go,

2221
01:38:00,661 --> 01:38:02,520
wow,
that's incredible.

2222
01:38:02,521 --> 01:38:05,310
Like they're going to get a great 
feeling off of seeing your art.

2223
01:38:05,450 --> 01:38:06,540
Yeah.
You have the same vision,

2224
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:12,000
oh,
I painted that tree and this other 

2225
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,181
person or that antelope or that bison or
whatever you find in the walls of the 

2226
01:38:14,181 --> 01:38:15,960
and this other person comes to like,
oh my God,

2227
01:38:15,961 --> 01:38:17,440
that's an incredible bison.
There's no,

2228
01:38:17,790 --> 01:38:22,790
like you did something the other person 
connected to now you the two of you are 

2229
01:38:22,790 --> 01:38:25,110
joined in your understanding of what 
that painting means.

2230
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:27,720
Right.
And that's a very powerful thing.

2231
01:38:27,721 --> 01:38:32,100
So if you drew that bison and no one 
else in the world ever saw it,

2232
01:38:32,910 --> 01:38:37,910
I'm guessing that the chemical rewards 
for that creativity would be let will be

2233
01:38:38,191 --> 01:38:39,240
lower.
Yeah.

2234
01:38:39,390 --> 01:38:39,840
I,
you know,

2235
01:38:39,841 --> 01:38:44,841
I noticed that in my children,
my kids love to draw and one of the 

2236
01:38:44,841 --> 01:38:44,841
things that they love is showing their 
drawings.

2237
01:38:44,841 --> 01:38:46,290
I mean they love to draw but like not 
yet.

2238
01:38:46,291 --> 01:38:47,160
Not yet,
not yet.

2239
01:38:47,370 --> 01:38:50,940
And then when they're done like look,
try and I'm just like boom.

2240
01:38:50,941 --> 01:38:55,941
They did getting that little rush 
themselves and you get the rush and I 

2241
01:38:55,941 --> 01:38:57,000
mean look,
I mean just do it.

2242
01:38:57,180 --> 01:39:02,180
It's easy to test like taking musician,
measure their neurochemicals while 

2243
01:39:02,180 --> 01:39:03,900
they're practicing in a room by 
themselves and then put them in a,

2244
01:39:04,170 --> 01:39:06,210
in a,
in a stadium filled with 10,000

2245
01:39:06,211 --> 01:39:08,030
people and see what happens.
Well,

2246
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:13,040
I'm guessing that the guy in the stadium
with the Bruce Springsteen in front of 

2247
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:16,701
10,000
people is experiencing a neurochemical 

2248
01:39:16,701 --> 01:39:17,400
reality that he's not getting in his 
living room.

2249
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:22,910
Not only that'll probably a 
neurochemical reality that very few 

2250
01:39:22,910 --> 01:39:22,910
human beings will ever experience.
That's right.

2251
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:26,940
Some sort of a strange.
But think about the power of that.

2252
01:39:26,970 --> 01:39:27,660
I mean,
you know,

2253
01:39:27,661 --> 01:39:32,661
any musician on stage is basically 
acting sort of in the role of the 

2254
01:39:32,661 --> 01:39:32,661
Shaman,
right?

2255
01:39:32,661 --> 01:39:33,870
To like,
I'm going to act.

2256
01:39:34,170 --> 01:39:39,170
I'm going to act as a conduit between 
you all and the divine right and my 

2257
01:39:39,901 --> 01:39:41,160
music is going to do it.
My words,

2258
01:39:41,161 --> 01:39:42,990
you're going to do it by dances going to
whatever it is,

2259
01:39:42,991 --> 01:39:44,250
but I'm the conduit,
right?

2260
01:39:44,251 --> 01:39:46,230
I don't matter.
I'm connecting you with a,

2261
01:39:46,370 --> 01:39:51,370
with a divine feeling and that feeling 
is going to unify all of you and I'm 

2262
01:39:51,370 --> 01:39:55,131
going to play these chords.
I'm going to sing this song and like 

2263
01:39:55,131 --> 01:39:56,010
magic.
You are going to be tapping your feet in

2264
01:39:56,011 --> 01:39:58,110
unison.
Like how do you get 10,000

2265
01:39:58,111 --> 01:40:00,150
people do the same thing at the same 
time.

2266
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:02,550
You sing them a song is the only way to 
do it.

2267
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:05,940
That's an incredibly powerful thing and 
that's the uh,

2268
01:40:05,980 --> 01:40:10,980
I mean that's the power of the Shaman.
I mean bruce springsteen isn't a shaman 

2269
01:40:10,980 --> 01:40:12,060
literally,
but he occupies that space in a modern,

2270
01:40:12,061 --> 01:40:17,061
secular,
secular society doesn't have shebeens 

2271
01:40:17,061 --> 01:40:17,061
but,
but in the old days,

2272
01:40:17,061 --> 01:40:17,330
that's what he would be.

2273
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:19,230
Do you feel that way when you put a book
out?

2274
01:40:20,130 --> 01:40:21,960
Like when you put the book out,
when you know it's done,

2275
01:40:21,961 --> 01:40:26,961
you read it,
it's done and he sent it out there and 

2276
01:40:26,961 --> 01:40:26,961
do what kind of weird feeling that you 
get.

2277
01:40:26,961 --> 01:40:30,590
Are People going to read that?
It's an interesting thing about a book 

2278
01:40:30,590 --> 01:40:33,231
because you actually never observe in 
real time people's reaction to it.

2279
01:40:34,260 --> 01:40:39,260
I mean,
I'm not perched in someone's arm chair 

2280
01:40:39,260 --> 01:40:39,260
watching them read in bed.
You know what I mean?

2281
01:40:39,260 --> 01:40:41,010
Like the general public about like 
reviews.

2282
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:42,360
Yeah,
but that's also very.

2283
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:47,750
It's very distant.
But when I started making documentaries 

2284
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:51,840
for the first time,
I had the experience or the experiencing

2285
01:40:51,841 --> 01:40:54,190
of watching other people's experience 
when I'd done

2286
01:40:54,910 --> 01:40:56,500
right.
I'm not watching the audience,

2287
01:40:56,620 --> 01:40:59,110
I'm in the audience and I'm watching 
people react to ristreppo.

2288
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:04,320
Yes.
I never got to see people react to the 

2289
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:04,320
books I read because I'm not in there 
damn bedroom.

2290
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:05,170
Right?
Right.

2291
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:10,440
But I am in the movie theater.
I'm watching people react to the things 

2292
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:12,760
that the films I made.
And I wouldn't say it's apples.

2293
01:41:12,761 --> 01:41:14,740
Oranges under know,
which is one better was what,

2294
01:41:14,741 --> 01:41:15,250
you know,
whatever.

2295
01:41:15,251 --> 01:41:18,550
But it's a very different experience in.
It's incredibly powerful.

2296
01:41:19,180 --> 01:41:22,480
Which do you like one better?
I mean,

2297
01:41:22,481 --> 01:41:27,481
movies just can't.
They don't have enough bits of 

2298
01:41:27,481 --> 01:41:28,030
information.
I mean a book.

2299
01:41:28,180 --> 01:41:30,670
You can really communicate information,
right?

2300
01:41:30,671 --> 01:41:33,880
Very sophisticated ideas and they're 
permanent,

2301
01:41:33,881 --> 01:41:38,881
right there.
They are in the person's bookshelf and 

2302
01:41:38,881 --> 01:41:38,881
the person could underline that 
paragraph and go back to it.

2303
01:41:38,881 --> 01:41:43,201
You know,
you've actually affected sort of 

2304
01:41:43,201 --> 01:41:45,451
communal thinking.
You've affected the way people 

2305
01:41:45,451 --> 01:41:48,001
understand the world of film is an 
experience more than it is a sort of 

2306
01:41:48,100 --> 01:41:51,790
data dump and um,
or a philosophical argument.

2307
01:41:52,530 --> 01:41:54,520
And that experience is very,
very powerful.

2308
01:41:54,530 --> 01:41:56,920
It acts on a different part of the brain
than a book does.

2309
01:41:57,940 --> 01:42:00,530
It's much more emotional.
Um,

2310
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:01,600
I mean,
I've,

2311
01:42:01,630 --> 01:42:02,230
you know,
I've,

2312
01:42:02,290 --> 01:42:07,290
I've choked up,
I've teared up watching my own films 

2313
01:42:07,290 --> 01:42:08,170
because they're personal to me,
you know,

2314
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:10,180
I've never done that reading my own 
book,

2315
01:42:10,210 --> 01:42:15,210
rereading a book that I've written,
so it's a different experience and I 

2316
01:42:15,210 --> 01:42:16,900
would never say this is different parts 
of the human mind like you need,

2317
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:18,940
you certainly need boats.
So no long answer.

2318
01:42:18,941 --> 01:42:20,540
I don't have a preference.
I feel like I,

2319
01:42:20,820 --> 01:42:23,480
I need both now.
This documentary on Syria,

2320
01:42:23,990 --> 01:42:25,630
um,
when is this available?

2321
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:26,760
Well,
it,

2322
01:42:27,070 --> 01:42:28,780
we may,
it's called Hell on earth.

2323
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:31,720
Um,
our website is hell on earth.com.

2324
01:42:31,780 --> 01:42:32,440
It's,
um,

2325
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:37,500
how'd you get that?
It seems like that would have already 

2326
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:37,500
been taken,
right?

2327
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:38,070
The different websites that are 
available.

2328
01:42:38,070 --> 01:42:39,550
And that's true.
That's true.

2329
01:42:39,660 --> 01:42:41,110
I thought about that.
I didn't,

2330
01:42:41,111 --> 01:42:43,240
I wasn't in charge of getting it by the 
wizard.

2331
01:42:43,610 --> 01:42:45,160
Right.
I'm going to have to pay for that one.

2332
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:48,100
So it was called Hell on earth.
It's about the Syrian civil war.

2333
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:50,200
Um,
we made it for National Geographic.

2334
01:42:50,201 --> 01:42:55,201
I made it with Nick quested,
my partner and all the films that I've 

2335
01:42:55,201 --> 01:42:55,201
made.
Um,

2336
01:42:55,330 --> 01:42:58,480
and it,
it brought it broadcast last June.

2337
01:42:58,660 --> 01:42:59,460
It's gonna,
you know,

2338
01:42:59,470 --> 01:43:01,420
nat Geo rebroadcasts,
everything that they do,

2339
01:43:01,421 --> 01:43:04,360
obviously you can also go to their 
website and stream it.

2340
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:06,130
It's about this treatment today.
Yeah,

2341
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:08,050
absolutely.
It's about the Syrian civil war,

2342
01:43:08,051 --> 01:43:09,690
how it started.
Um,

2343
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:12,970
and particularly how isis,
why isis arose up out of that.

2344
01:43:13,140 --> 01:43:18,140
And we all know what Isis is.
This is grotesquely violent radical 

2345
01:43:18,140 --> 01:43:18,900
jihadist movement.
Um,

2346
01:43:19,330 --> 01:43:20,470
and,
and that,

2347
01:43:20,471 --> 01:43:21,370
um,
we have all seen,

2348
01:43:21,870 --> 01:43:26,870
seen their video,
heard of their videos where they're 

2349
01:43:26,870 --> 01:43:29,220
beheading people and you know,
in front of a video camera and a 

2350
01:43:29,220 --> 01:43:29,220
ghastly,
ghastly things.

2351
01:43:29,220 --> 01:43:29,470
He said,
why did that,

2352
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:31,600
why did that happen in Syria?
How did that,

2353
01:43:31,870 --> 01:43:36,870
that mutation occur at this point in 
history in that place.

2354
01:43:36,881 --> 01:43:37,490
And so the,
the,

2355
01:43:37,510 --> 01:43:40,660
the film examines that.
And um,

2356
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:42,790
were you there?
Did you go to Syria?

2357
01:43:42,850 --> 01:43:43,360
No,
you know,

2358
01:43:43,361 --> 01:43:45,700
after my friend Tim Hetherington was 
killed,

2359
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:46,330
uh,
Tim,

2360
01:43:46,650 --> 01:43:50,500
obviously I made restrepo with an,
he was a brother and a good friend and a

2361
01:43:50,501 --> 01:43:53,450
colleague and he was killed in Libya in 
2011,

2362
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:58,960
uh,
on an assignment that I was supposed to 

2363
01:43:58,960 --> 01:43:58,960
be on with him at the last minute.
I couldn't go and he got killed.

2364
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:01,580
And so I stopped war reporting after 
that front line reporting.

2365
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,750
Syria was so dangerous that you couldn't
think of going in there.

2366
01:44:05,751 --> 01:44:07,870
I mean,
in numerous kidnappings and beheadings,

2367
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:13,340
um,
it was basically a suicide by the time 

2368
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:13,340
we started working on the story.
It was a suicide mission.

2369
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:17,980
So we actually worked with Syrians in 
Syria who are documenting their own war.

2370
01:44:18,650 --> 01:44:23,650
Wow.
I'm a including an incredible family 

2371
01:44:23,650 --> 01:44:27,011
that was living under a,
in territory under isis control and 

2372
01:44:27,011 --> 01:44:28,940
surviving.
They were trying to figure out like,

2373
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:34,300
do we try to escape or not?
And of course if you try to escape and 

2374
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:34,300
you're caught,
you're dead.

2375
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:35,960
They will drag your family out of a 
pickup truck in line.

2376
01:44:35,961 --> 01:44:37,190
You open a wall,
a machine gun you.

2377
01:44:37,820 --> 01:44:39,350
But they were worried that if they 
stayed,

2378
01:44:39,351 --> 01:44:41,960
they also die and they decided to 
escape.

2379
01:44:41,961 --> 01:44:46,100
We got a camera to them at a very 
nondescript little cell phone camera and

2380
01:44:46,101 --> 01:44:51,101
they self documented life under isis and
the decision to leave and the um,

2381
01:44:51,830 --> 01:44:56,830
their flight through the isis 
checkpoints through the front lines all 

2382
01:44:56,830 --> 01:44:57,560
the way to Turkey and they self 
documented and it's part of,

2383
01:44:57,590 --> 01:44:59,330
it's the sort of through line in the 
movie.

2384
01:44:59,780 --> 01:45:02,090
Absolutely extraordinary family.
Wow.

2385
01:45:02,091 --> 01:45:04,570
And so then they're in Turkey,
now you're in Turkey.

2386
01:45:04,610 --> 01:45:07,940
Then they tried to get to Greece on a 
rubber raft on a Zodiac.

2387
01:45:07,941 --> 01:45:10,160
They returned again.
This is also documented by them.

2388
01:45:10,161 --> 01:45:12,530
It's in the film.
They returned back at the last moment by

2389
01:45:12,531 --> 01:45:15,110
the,
by the Turkish coast guard sent back and

2390
01:45:15,111 --> 01:45:16,850
now they're increasing their actually 
doing really well.

2391
01:45:16,851 --> 01:45:19,880
They started a small business.
They're incredibly hard working,

2392
01:45:19,881 --> 01:45:21,230
resourceful,
beautiful people.

2393
01:45:21,231 --> 01:45:21,760
I mean,
they're,

2394
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:27,280
you know,
like I wish they could come to this 

2395
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:27,280
country.
We'd be lucky to have them and they'd be

2396
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:30,461
lucky to have us.
There are an incredible family and if 

2397
01:45:30,461 --> 01:45:30,461
you see the film,
you'll see what I'm talking about.

2398
01:45:30,461 --> 01:45:35,200
That's a,
that's a big point that a lot of people 

2399
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:37,280
felt was missed at all the criticisms of
immigrants coming over to this country,

2400
01:45:37,310 --> 01:45:38,940
you know,
the stock closed the border,

2401
01:45:38,950 --> 01:45:43,950
stop allowing Muslims stop allowing all 
these people to come over from these 

2402
01:45:43,950 --> 01:45:47,500
dangerous areas that somehow know that 
these people would be agents of these 

2403
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:49,130
dangerous areas coming to destroy our 
democracy.

2404
01:45:49,131 --> 01:45:52,460
But these people are trapped.
A lot of these people are,

2405
01:45:52,510 --> 01:45:55,100
are people that are experiencing these 
horrible conditions,

2406
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:58,550
much like many of the people that 
originally made it to America and the.

2407
01:45:58,950 --> 01:45:59,430
Yeah.
I mean,

2408
01:45:59,431 --> 01:46:01,140
our country is immigrants.
This country is.

2409
01:46:01,141 --> 01:46:04,290
My father is a two time or refugee,
right?

2410
01:46:04,291 --> 01:46:06,300
I mean,
he fled Spain during the civil war.

2411
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:07,170
I mean,
he's passed away.

2412
01:46:07,171 --> 01:46:08,280
He was born in Nineteen,
29,

2413
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:09,270
19,
23.

2414
01:46:09,510 --> 01:46:13,080
He fled Spain during the civil war.
Then he fled France because of the Nazis

2415
01:46:13,081 --> 01:46:14,490
rolled in.
He came to this country.

2416
01:46:14,820 --> 01:46:19,820
He was a brilliant physicist and we were
lucky to have him and he was eternally 

2417
01:46:19,820 --> 01:46:20,970
lucky to be part of this country as 
well.

2418
01:46:21,580 --> 01:46:25,530
Um,
so what was odd about trump's try not to

2419
01:46:25,531 --> 01:46:30,531
get political again,
but I got to say what was odd about 

2420
01:46:30,531 --> 01:46:32,721
trump's travel ban did.
There were countries that we'd never 

2421
01:46:32,721 --> 01:46:35,811
been attacked by.
No one from those countries had ever 

2422
01:46:35,811 --> 01:46:35,811
attacked this country.
Like,

2423
01:46:35,811 --> 01:46:39,561
I don't want to go.
Like what are those countries doing on 

2424
01:46:39,561 --> 01:46:41,481
the travel ban?
This lunatic that killed people in New 

2425
01:46:41,481 --> 01:46:41,481
York.
It was Becca.

2426
01:46:41,481 --> 01:46:43,000
Stan like that wasn't on the travel ban.
Like the,

2427
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:48,120
I mean,
I understand trying to create a filter 

2428
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:48,120
that keeps bad people out.
Of course,

2429
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:52,641
every country does that just didn't 
understand this specific logic of those 

2430
01:46:52,641 --> 01:46:53,220
countries on the list.
That made no sense to me.

2431
01:46:53,470 --> 01:46:55,360
No.
It made no sense to anybody.

2432
01:46:55,510 --> 01:47:00,510
And it's also,
you're assuming that everybody in these 

2433
01:47:00,510 --> 01:47:01,780
areas is bad,
including the people that try and escape

2434
01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:03,550
that sounds.
That sounds insane.

2435
01:47:03,850 --> 01:47:06,190
And that sounds.
It's just,

2436
01:47:06,210 --> 01:47:11,050
it's cruel and anti human to not want 
people to have a chance.

2437
01:47:11,051 --> 01:47:12,850
I'm not saying don't vet these people 
out.

2438
01:47:12,851 --> 01:47:17,851
Don't interview them and communicate 
with them and find out what their 

2439
01:47:17,851 --> 01:47:18,540
backgrounds are.
As much information as you can get you,

2440
01:47:18,610 --> 01:47:23,610
of course you are you concerned because 
this is something that has been 

2441
01:47:23,610 --> 01:47:24,700
bothering me.
I was concerned about my own reaction to

2442
01:47:24,701 --> 01:47:29,650
yesterday's mass shooting that I was 
almost nonchalant about it.

2443
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:30,430
I was like,
well,

2444
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:33,520
there's another one like that.
We're getting numb

2445
01:47:33,700 --> 01:47:34,660
to mass shooting.
You know,

2446
01:47:34,661 --> 01:47:39,661
I ask myself two questions and it didn't
mean to ask them and I'm just being 

2447
01:47:39,661 --> 01:47:43,240
honest and telling people this.
I asked myself,

2448
01:47:43,300 --> 01:47:45,250
I wonder if it was a white church or a 
black church.

2449
01:47:45,610 --> 01:47:50,610
And I asked myself,
I wonder if the attacker wasn't Islamic 

2450
01:47:50,610 --> 01:47:51,280
radical and a foreigner or was he a 
homegrown American?

2451
01:47:51,810 --> 01:47:53,080
I assumed it was a.
He obviously.

2452
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:54,130
Yeah.
Um,

2453
01:47:54,670 --> 01:47:59,670
and I don't even know what that says,
what those questions say about me or 

2454
01:47:59,670 --> 01:48:01,420
about the country.
But it's really interesting.

2455
01:48:01,421 --> 01:48:03,850
Those are the first things I asked and I
didn't like.

2456
01:48:04,270 --> 01:48:09,270
I didn't like that.
Those questions came to my mind so 

2457
01:48:09,270 --> 01:48:09,270
quickly.
There was something about it that didn't

2458
01:48:09,270 --> 01:48:10,360
feel good and they're very obvious 
questions to ask.

2459
01:48:10,361 --> 01:48:10,850
I mean,
you know,

2460
01:48:10,870 --> 01:48:14,800
it's clear that those are very important
things to know.

2461
01:48:15,250 --> 01:48:17,440
But I didn't like that it came to me so 
quickly.

2462
01:48:17,950 --> 01:48:18,640
Yeah,
I am.

2463
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:20,930
It's the exact same questions,
but I also felt like it's just,

2464
01:48:21,350 --> 01:48:24,380
these are patterns.
They're inescapable patterns,

2465
01:48:24,381 --> 01:48:28,730
whether it's the Vegas massacre or this 
one or the Orlando shootings.

2466
01:48:29,150 --> 01:48:34,150
It's always a man and a.
is it a Muslim or is it a crazy white 

2467
01:48:34,150 --> 01:48:34,150
guy?

2468
01:48:34,330 --> 01:48:34,900
Well,
you know,

2469
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:38,320
in tribe I write about mass shootings 
are a very particular thing.

2470
01:48:38,321 --> 01:48:43,321
I mean there's gang shootings in Chicago
or whatever that may have a kind of 

2471
01:48:43,321 --> 01:48:43,321
logic to them.
Right?

2472
01:48:43,321 --> 01:48:44,590
Like you're controlling turf.
There's money involved.

2473
01:48:44,591 --> 01:48:45,380
Drugs would.
Yeah,

2474
01:48:45,430 --> 01:48:46,200
it makes sense.
So,

2475
01:48:46,210 --> 01:48:47,830
so you,
a bunch of innocent people get shot.

2476
01:48:47,890 --> 01:48:51,130
That's the price you pay for gang wars.
There's a logic to it.

2477
01:48:51,131 --> 01:48:55,000
There is mass shootings are completely 
nihilistic,

2478
01:48:55,060 --> 01:48:58,690
right?
It's someone killing as many people that

2479
01:48:58,691 --> 01:49:02,320
he doesn't know right as possible before
he dies.

2480
01:49:02,470 --> 01:49:06,670
It's totally nihilistic.
And what I found,

2481
01:49:06,671 --> 01:49:09,190
and I did a lot of research into it,
that,

2482
01:49:09,191 --> 01:49:14,191
that those kinds of mass shootings 
typically happen in middle class 

2483
01:49:14,261 --> 01:49:19,261
communities like otherwise safe middle 
class communities or small low crime 

2484
01:49:19,391 --> 01:49:24,391
Christian communities,
they have never happened in the inner 

2485
01:49:24,391 --> 01:49:26,620
city even literally never happened.
Um,

2486
01:49:27,090 --> 01:49:32,090
they,
they happen in communities that are 

2487
01:49:32,090 --> 01:49:32,090
otherwise very safe,
very Christian,

2488
01:49:32,090 --> 01:49:33,040
very,
very,

2489
01:49:33,120 --> 01:49:34,720
um,
boring frankly.

2490
01:49:34,810 --> 01:49:37,690
Um,
and it really made me wonder like,

2491
01:49:37,750 --> 01:49:38,590
is there,
I mean,

2492
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:41,410
lots of countries have as many guns as 
we do.

2493
01:49:42,490 --> 01:49:45,010
Every country has crazy people in it,
in them,

2494
01:49:45,011 --> 01:49:50,011
right?
We are the only that does this to 

2495
01:49:50,011 --> 01:49:53,701
ourselves.
And we do it only in a certain kind of 

2496
01:49:53,701 --> 01:49:53,701
community,
right?

2497
01:49:53,750 --> 01:49:57,160
We're doesn't happen in high crime,
low income communities,

2498
01:49:57,280 --> 01:50:02,280
right?
It happens in the most sort of like 

2499
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:02,280
small,
quiet,

2500
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:02,920
Christian,
low crime,

2501
01:50:03,010 --> 01:50:05,410
bland,
suburban or rural communities.

2502
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:06,640
That's where it happens.
Uh,

2503
01:50:06,641 --> 01:50:11,410
what does it say?
Why is it that these communities are not

2504
01:50:11,411 --> 01:50:16,411
producing crazy people?
But somehow those people come to a place

2505
01:50:17,141 --> 01:50:19,360
where they think this is a good thing to
do.

2506
01:50:19,361 --> 01:50:20,980
Like,
why is that happening?

2507
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:26,550
My theory is that the deep alienation of
the suburbs of sort of small town 

2508
01:50:29,051 --> 01:50:30,520
America,
the law,

2509
01:50:30,550 --> 01:50:35,550
the lack of real community effort,
um,

2510
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:38,220
and the lack of national unity and the 
Pa,

2511
01:50:38,221 --> 01:50:40,630
I mean the,
the mass killings have risen abruptly in

2512
01:50:40,631 --> 01:50:42,760
the last 15 years and I,
you know,

2513
01:50:42,761 --> 01:50:43,630
it's hard for me,
it's,

2514
01:50:44,050 --> 01:50:46,690
you don't murder people in your own 
community when that happens.

2515
01:50:46,691 --> 01:50:49,390
It means the community doesn't exist,
at least for the murderer.

2516
01:50:49,450 --> 01:50:49,610
And

2517
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:55,040
do you see any connection or do you 
consider any connection between psych 

2518
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:55,040
drugs?

2519
01:50:55,610 --> 01:51:00,610
I mean,
I don't know how many of these people 

2520
01:51:00,610 --> 01:51:00,610
are on psych drug

2521
01:51:00,610 --> 01:51:00,950
a tremendous amount.
Like there was a study that,

2522
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:02,960
uh,
that see if you could find it,

2523
01:51:02,961 --> 01:51:07,961
Jamie.
They connected all the mass shootings 

2524
01:51:07,961 --> 01:51:11,230
that have happened over the last two 
decades with all the different 

2525
01:51:11,230 --> 01:51:15,371
medications that people are on and every
single one of them was on something or 

2526
01:51:15,371 --> 01:51:15,950
was withdrawing from.

2527
01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:16,950
Okay.
So there's,

2528
01:51:16,980 --> 01:51:21,980
here's the question,
where are the drugs creating the 

2529
01:51:21,980 --> 01:51:24,531
behavior or the drugs?
Treating a mental disorder that is self 

2530
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:27,510
is tied to the behavior.
Very good question,

2531
01:51:27,630 --> 01:51:28,330
right?
I mean there's,

2532
01:51:28,331 --> 01:51:33,331
there's no way to know mass shootings of
the nihilistic sort that I'm referring 

2533
01:51:33,331 --> 01:51:37,170
to started abrupt abruptly rose in the 
eighties.

2534
01:51:37,860 --> 01:51:39,380
Okay.
Um,

2535
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:44,600
and then doubled since 2006 and I think 
they're increasing even more since that.

2536
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:45,760
So

2537
01:51:46,430 --> 01:51:50,510
mass shooting over the last 20 years has
one thing in common and isn't guns.

2538
01:51:50,570 --> 01:51:51,020
Yeah.
This is

2539
01:51:52,260 --> 01:51:53,050
right.
But that's not,

2540
01:51:53,630 --> 01:51:56,590
that's not just positive.
Right.

2541
01:51:56,900 --> 01:51:57,810
You know what I mean?
Like it's,

2542
01:51:57,850 --> 01:51:58,640
you're right.
It's not.

2543
01:51:58,641 --> 01:52:00,620
Correlation doesn't mean it couldn't be 
dishing.

2544
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:05,090
It could be the depression is rising in 
alienated communities and the depression

2545
01:52:05,091 --> 01:52:07,070
is getting treated,
unsuccessfully treated with drugs.

2546
01:52:07,071 --> 01:52:10,340
All these people were on drugs.
But really what's happening is that,

2547
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:12,680
and this is true suicide,
depression,

2548
01:52:12,681 --> 01:52:14,030
ptsd,
anxiety,

2549
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:20,200
alienation,
all of these things are going up in 

2550
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:20,200
society and that's just statistically

2551
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:24,640
unquestionably.
The question that I would have about 

2552
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:24,640
this though is that when I've talked to 
psyche,

2553
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:27,980
a psychiatrist about it,
they say that the dissociative aspect of

2554
01:52:27,981 --> 01:52:32,981
the psychiatric medications that are 
part of the problems that people do not 

2555
01:52:32,981 --> 01:52:36,311
feel,
they don't feel the connection even to 

2556
01:52:36,311 --> 01:52:36,740
their actions,
that they can do something horrific like

2557
01:52:36,741 --> 01:52:41,741
shoot people and they might be even 
doing that to try to get some feeling.

2558
01:52:42,580 --> 01:52:44,050
Listen,
that's totally possible.

2559
01:52:44,051 --> 01:52:46,370
I would also offer this idea

2560
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:51,460
that the massive national addiction to 
violent video games is a dissociated 

2561
01:52:51,710 --> 01:52:53,630
experience.
You're shooting people,

2562
01:52:53,631 --> 01:52:55,340
they're not real people.
That doesn't happen.

2563
01:52:55,390 --> 01:52:56,320
You know?
I mean,

2564
01:52:56,620 --> 01:52:58,610
I'm just are connected somehow.
I don't know,

2565
01:52:58,611 --> 01:53:03,611
but I'm just saying what you just 
described happening in the streets of 

2566
01:53:03,611 --> 01:53:06,200
America is exactly duplicated digitally 
in video games.

2567
01:53:06,230 --> 01:53:07,910
Right?
But the video games doesn't.

2568
01:53:07,940 --> 01:53:12,940
It doesn't keep you from feeling things 
in the real world where the psych 

2569
01:53:12,940 --> 01:53:12,940
medications do.
Right,

2570
01:53:12,940 --> 01:53:17,000
but did the experience of shooting at 
human targets that aren't real.

2571
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:22,080
Right?
If you incorporate that into how you 

2572
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:22,430
feel about shooting and then you go out 
into the real world,

2573
01:53:22,460 --> 01:53:25,620
it may not be that hard to particularly 
with the age of eight of psych drugs,

2574
01:53:25,670 --> 01:53:30,670
drugs and whatever.
Depression is sort of endemic in this 

2575
01:53:30,670 --> 01:53:30,820
society right now.
It might not be hard to.

2576
01:53:30,930 --> 01:53:35,930
To transpose that dissociated experience
in a video game with digital images 

2577
01:53:36,771 --> 01:53:41,771
transpose it onto actual humans in the 
real world if you're sufficiently 

2578
01:53:41,771 --> 01:53:41,771
disturbed.

2579
01:53:41,771 --> 01:53:46,210
That's a very good connection and an 
interesting question because I haven't 

2580
01:53:46,210 --> 01:53:49,501
heard it a discussed when they're 
talking about war and how kids that grow

2581
01:53:49,761 --> 01:53:52,430
up playing call of duty and things along
those lines,

2582
01:53:52,431 --> 01:53:55,940
they get really good at.
It would be actually better in combat.

2583
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:59,060
They would have the tactics mapped out 
in their mind better.

2584
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:00,230
Yeah,
yeah,

2585
01:54:00,290 --> 01:54:01,430
absolutely.
Absolutely.

2586
01:54:01,431 --> 01:54:01,790
I mean,
look,

2587
01:54:01,791 --> 01:54:03,710
there's a TV program called active 
shooter,

2588
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:05,440
right?
Like and they go back.

2589
01:54:05,970 --> 01:54:07,580
I've just heard about it.
I haven't seen it.

2590
01:54:07,581 --> 01:54:09,260
I would never watch it,
but it's,

2591
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:14,320
it's they go back and recreate.
They re interview everyone who's 

2592
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:16,550
survived active shooting incident and 
recreate it and now people watch for.

2593
01:54:16,551 --> 01:54:17,510
I mean,
in some sense,

2594
01:54:17,511 --> 01:54:18,320
entertainment,
right?

2595
01:54:18,321 --> 01:54:20,420
TV is entertainment.
They watch for entertainment,

2596
01:54:20,660 --> 01:54:23,270
recreations of acting,
shooting incidents that are,

2597
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:27,930
I think partly the result of the kind of
deep alienation that happens in a,

2598
01:54:27,980 --> 01:54:30,040
an immediate obsessed society that 
we're,

2599
01:54:30,050 --> 01:54:30,830
no one's talking to each other.

2600
01:54:30,830 --> 01:54:32,150
You know what I mean?
It's a perfect circle,

2601
01:54:32,151 --> 01:54:32,720
right?
Like,

2602
01:54:33,410 --> 01:54:34,670
well,
they're definitely escalating,

2603
01:54:34,671 --> 01:54:39,671
right?
I mean we had the event in New York 

2604
01:54:39,671 --> 01:54:41,171
where the guy runs over all those people
and then a couple of days later or 

2605
01:54:41,171 --> 01:54:41,840
having the one in taxes.
So this is,

2606
01:54:41,870 --> 01:54:44,630
this is happening over the scale of one 
of the year,

2607
01:54:44,631 --> 01:54:47,240
one every few years.
We're getting a once a week.

2608
01:54:47,390 --> 01:54:47,990
Well,
yeah,

2609
01:54:47,991 --> 01:54:51,500
and what's interesting,
I mean in New York there was an ideology

2610
01:54:51,501 --> 01:54:53,270
behind it,
so it wasn't nihilistic.

2611
01:54:53,271 --> 01:54:56,000
I mean it felt nihilistic to us,
but to that guy,

2612
01:54:56,001 --> 01:54:58,010
he actually believed in what he was 
doing,

2613
01:54:58,520 --> 01:55:02,840
but the real mass shooters that they're 
just out there to kill as many people as

2614
01:55:02,841 --> 01:55:05,350
possible.
It's hard to know what the ideology is.

2615
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:10,420
Well,
this guy was dishonorably discharged 

2616
01:55:10,420 --> 01:55:10,420
from the military for something.
I forget what it was.

2617
01:55:10,420 --> 01:55:11,900
So he was in a position,
what's up?

2618
01:55:11,980 --> 01:55:15,610
It was a abuse on his spouse and child.
Right.

2619
01:55:16,310 --> 01:55:19,790
And he didn't have a license to own a 
gun,

2620
01:55:19,910 --> 01:55:22,640
but you know,
he owns whatever guns did he had.

2621
01:55:22,641 --> 01:55:26,420
He got them illegally in Colorado where 
he drove to Colorado.

2622
01:55:26,900 --> 01:55:27,670
That's what I heard.
He got,

2623
01:55:27,671 --> 01:55:31,010
it was in Texas.
I think he got them into Colorado.

2624
01:55:31,070 --> 01:55:32,990
Did he get them at a gun show or 
something like that?

2625
01:55:33,470 --> 01:55:35,480
I don't know where I go,
but yeah,

2626
01:55:35,481 --> 01:55:37,310
I mean we're looking at little tiny 
details.

2627
01:55:37,311 --> 01:55:40,160
The real question is how the fuck does a
person do something like that?

2628
01:55:40,161 --> 01:55:42,460
I mean shot babies,
you know what I mean?

2629
01:55:42,470 --> 01:55:44,010
Shot five-year-olds and

2630
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:47,250
the whole thing is just.
It doesn't even make sense.

2631
01:55:47,510 --> 01:55:50,490
And I don't know if he was on a psych 
medication or if they know he was,

2632
01:55:51,120 --> 01:55:56,120
but you know,
just the staggering numbers of broken 

2633
01:55:56,120 --> 01:55:56,120
individuals that are committing these 
crimes.

2634
01:55:56,120 --> 01:55:57,960
It's just very,
very confusing.

2635
01:55:58,650 --> 01:56:02,520
And you think that it's tied to what was
what you were saying too,

2636
01:56:02,521 --> 01:56:07,521
about communities about inner cities 
where you have impoverished high crime 

2637
01:56:08,221 --> 01:56:10,500
areas,
but they're not seeing these things.

2638
01:56:10,680 --> 01:56:15,680
Do you think because in these high crime
communities are dealing with much more 

2639
01:56:15,680 --> 01:56:16,980
life and death and the struggles much 
more real,

2640
01:56:16,981 --> 01:56:18,090
that they feel more connected?

2641
01:56:19,090 --> 01:56:21,370
I.
This is totally a theory.

2642
01:56:21,371 --> 01:56:26,371
I mean I have no idea.
It's just the truth is that those awful 

2643
01:56:26,371 --> 01:56:30,181
sort of school shootings and mass 
shootings in the streets have never 

2644
01:56:30,181 --> 01:56:32,140
happened in a high crime,
high crime neighborhood,

2645
01:56:32,170 --> 01:56:37,170
and so one has to wonder what is it?
It's possible that for all their very 

2646
01:56:37,841 --> 01:56:42,841
real stresses and traumas of poverty,
that for all of those things,

2647
01:56:43,721 --> 01:56:48,721
there is also more face to face communal
connection in poor neighborhoods than in

2648
01:56:50,321 --> 01:56:52,960
wealthy neighborhoods or in middle class
neighborhoods and that,

2649
01:56:52,961 --> 01:56:57,961
that communal connection.
I mean literally meeting people in the 

2650
01:56:57,961 --> 01:56:57,961
landing of your apartment building,
right?

2651
01:56:57,961 --> 01:56:59,890
Meaning people in the door,
stoop on the street,

2652
01:56:59,891 --> 01:57:01,490
you know,
with that,

2653
01:57:01,510 --> 01:57:04,910
those kinds of human interactions even 
at even in a,

2654
01:57:05,550 --> 01:57:07,450
in an economically stressed 
neighborhood,

2655
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:13,080
that those create enough of a sense of 
community that people who might 

2656
01:57:13,080 --> 01:57:17,010
otherwise go crazy and turn their guns 
in this nihilistic weigh on people,

2657
01:57:17,410 --> 01:57:19,360
on innocent people that they just don't 
do it.

2658
01:57:19,420 --> 01:57:21,550
Because why would I do that to my own 
people?

2659
01:57:22,170 --> 01:57:27,170
That's the and what I fear in this 
country is that we're losing the sense 

2660
01:57:27,170 --> 01:57:30,541
of what our own people are,
what are our own people and if you're 

2661
01:57:30,541 --> 01:57:31,870
doing that in the streets of the 
neighboring town,

2662
01:57:31,871 --> 01:57:32,260
like,
you know,

2663
01:57:32,261 --> 01:57:36,020
clearly there's been some loss of like 
some idea of what,

2664
01:57:36,021 --> 01:57:38,920
what we belong to and that's where,
you know,

2665
01:57:38,921 --> 01:57:43,921
national service or a congressional 
commission that really calls out 

2666
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:47,260
rhetoric that that undermines our sense 
of who we are as a nation.

2667
01:57:47,261 --> 01:57:49,840
Like you know,
it might start at the top changing.

2668
01:57:49,841 --> 01:57:51,820
That might start at the top.
It might help.

2669
01:57:51,970 --> 01:57:52,880
Do you think there's any

2670
01:57:52,970 --> 01:57:57,970
incentive that the,
these people experience to be someone 

2671
01:57:57,970 --> 01:58:01,640
who creates this big event where 
everybody has to

2672
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:03,530
get them?
I mean,

2673
01:58:03,531 --> 01:58:04,160
I,
I don't,

2674
01:58:04,170 --> 01:58:06,540
I mean I'm guessing,
but I'm a,

2675
01:58:06,650 --> 01:58:11,650
I'm imagining that someone like that 
feels powerless and insignificant and 

2676
01:58:11,930 --> 01:58:16,930
abused by society and at least there'll 
be famous in their last acts and their 

2677
01:58:18,771 --> 01:58:23,771
death.
They're going to cause a lot of 

2678
01:58:23,771 --> 01:58:23,771
reaction.
They're going to.

2679
01:58:23,771 --> 01:58:23,771
They're like,
oh you,

2680
01:58:23,771 --> 01:58:26,060
you messed with me my whole life.
At least for the last five minutes about

2681
01:58:26,061 --> 01:58:31,061
my life.
You guys are the ones that are going to 

2682
01:58:31,061 --> 01:58:31,061
be scared.
You're going to be begging me for mercy.

2683
01:58:31,061 --> 01:58:32,660
No,
I begged you for mercy my whole life.

2684
01:58:32,930 --> 01:58:34,460
Now you're going to be begging me for 
mercy.

2685
01:58:34,530 --> 01:58:35,750
I mean,
I'm totally guessing,

2686
01:58:35,751 --> 01:58:37,070
right?
I'm just riffing here,

2687
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:42,280
but I,
I wouldn't be surprised if there was 

2688
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:42,280
something of that to it.

2689
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:45,010
It's a good gas.
I mean this has been a very common 

2690
01:58:45,010 --> 01:58:49,291
conversation lately as to whether or not
you discussed these people and even 

2691
01:58:49,291 --> 01:58:53,881
bring up their names.
I know in some places and some even 

2692
01:58:53,881 --> 01:58:55,180
media outlets,
they don't want to report on the person.

2693
01:58:55,320 --> 01:58:57,820
Individual is creating this chaos.

2694
01:58:58,420 --> 01:58:58,900
Well,
you know,

2695
01:58:58,901 --> 01:59:03,700
one of the things I think is a problem 
is that if you love this country,

2696
01:59:03,730 --> 01:59:08,730
there is a certain pressure to think 
it's the best possible country ever.

2697
01:59:10,120 --> 01:59:10,930
Right?
Yeah.

2698
01:59:11,260 --> 01:59:16,260
And I think it's very painful for 
Americans to actually look at the actual

2699
01:59:17,771 --> 01:59:19,750
statistics and say,
you know,

2700
01:59:19,751 --> 01:59:20,980
for example,
with mass shootings,

2701
01:59:20,981 --> 01:59:23,170
we were the only country that does this 
to ourselves.

2702
01:59:23,560 --> 01:59:25,930
The only one.
There's not another country that has not

2703
01:59:25,931 --> 01:59:28,950
at the rate that we do in China.
They were,

2704
01:59:28,951 --> 01:59:30,610
you know,
there's a rash of knife attacks.

2705
01:59:30,611 --> 01:59:31,020
Right.
I mean,

2706
01:59:31,030 --> 01:59:32,470
I'm just not that it doesn't happen at 
all,

2707
01:59:32,471 --> 01:59:36,160
but if you really look over the last 20 
years is more than that.

2708
01:59:36,161 --> 01:59:37,930
Since the eighties when this shit 
started.

2709
01:59:38,330 --> 01:59:40,890
Like we're the only country that does 
this regularly to ourselves.

2710
01:59:40,900 --> 01:59:43,240
It regularly to the point where it's 
like every month practically.

2711
01:59:43,260 --> 01:59:43,930
Right,
right.

2712
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:46,630
So it's,
it's a sign.

2713
01:59:46,631 --> 01:59:51,631
I mean,
if your child was acting out in a 

2714
01:59:51,631 --> 01:59:51,631
violent way and punching kids in the 
playground,

2715
01:59:51,631 --> 01:59:52,000
you think,
okay,

2716
01:59:52,001 --> 01:59:52,840
he's in pain.
Right?

2717
01:59:52,841 --> 01:59:54,970
He's acting out like,
what's wrong with this kid?

2718
01:59:54,971 --> 01:59:58,120
Like he's clearly in pain and some kind 
of pain and he's lashing out.

2719
01:59:58,690 --> 02:00:00,580
Well the society is in some kind of 
pain,

2720
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:02,410
like,
what is it you know,

2721
02:00:02,411 --> 02:00:03,730
and you,
you know,

2722
02:00:04,010 --> 02:00:06,500
you can just miss me as a bleeding heart
liberal,

2723
02:00:06,530 --> 02:00:07,210
you know,
whatever.

2724
02:00:07,211 --> 02:00:12,211
I don't mean you.
But one could dismiss me as a bleeding 

2725
02:00:12,211 --> 02:00:12,211
heart liberal.
Like,

2726
02:00:12,211 --> 02:00:12,211
okay,
well then what's your,

2727
02:00:12,211 --> 02:00:13,900
what's your question?
That my question is what,

2728
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:15,730
what,
why are we in so much pain?

2729
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Right.
That's the question that I think might 

2730
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,791
begin to lead to an answer of why 
there's such high suicide rates in such 

2731
02:00:23,791 --> 02:00:24,940
a wealthy society.
Why there's mass killing,

2732
02:00:24,980 --> 02:00:29,980
you know,
that would begin to answer those 

2733
02:00:29,980 --> 02:00:29,980
questions.
If you don't like that question.

2734
02:00:29,980 --> 02:00:32,590
What's your question?
To answer those terrible tragedies.

2735
02:00:32,620 --> 02:00:34,240
What's your question?
Well,

2736
02:00:34,570 --> 02:00:36,220
what you're saying is very compelling.

2737
02:00:36,700 --> 02:00:37,570
Uh,
and it's,

2738
02:00:37,660 --> 02:00:40,300
it's an aspect of this that I don't 
think is being considered.

2739
02:00:40,301 --> 02:00:43,840
And I think your book is very important 
when it comes to that.

2740
02:00:44,260 --> 02:00:47,080
I think the questions that you raise and
the,

2741
02:00:47,590 --> 02:00:52,590
all the,
the various examples that you give 

2742
02:00:52,590 --> 02:00:54,060
there,
it's really food for thought and I don't

2743
02:00:54,070 --> 02:00:56,290
think it's being discussed in very many 
other circles.

2744
02:00:56,291 --> 02:00:58,720
It's everyone's looking at the 
psychiatric drugs.

2745
02:00:58,721 --> 02:01:01,900
Everyone's looking at the white men with
guns and the gun problem,

2746
02:01:01,901 --> 02:01:05,440
the NRA and all these various aspects.
They're not looking at the root cause of

2747
02:01:05,441 --> 02:01:09,580
this depression,
anxiety and this detachment that we have

2748
02:01:09,581 --> 02:01:11,050
from our neighbors and our community.

2749
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:16,320
Look,
I mean Somalia has got a lot more guns 

2750
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:16,320
than we do,
right?

2751
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:16,320
And there's plenty of violence in 
Somalia,

2752
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:18,070
but no one's walking down the streets of
their own neighborhood,

2753
02:01:18,071 --> 02:01:20,620
massacring their own people.
Only we do that.

2754
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:22,240
And what is,
you know,

2755
02:01:22,241 --> 02:01:23,140
in a,
in a sense,

2756
02:01:23,141 --> 02:01:25,630
it's a call to a cry for help by our 
society,

2757
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:26,900
like,
uh,

2758
02:01:26,920 --> 02:01:31,920
not by that person.
I'm saying generally the phenomenon 

2759
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:31,920
within our society is I kind of cry for 
help.

2760
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:34,360
Like we are.
Something is wrong psychically,

2761
02:01:34,361 --> 02:01:39,361
spiritually wrong.
Christians will say we're not a 

2762
02:01:39,361 --> 02:01:39,361
Christian enough country,
but,

2763
02:01:39,361 --> 02:01:39,361
uh,
you know,

2764
02:01:39,361 --> 02:01:39,361
like,
that's,

2765
02:01:39,450 --> 02:01:40,280
that's,
that's,

2766
02:01:40,281 --> 02:01:41,360
uh,
that's not true.

2767
02:01:41,390 --> 02:01:44,210
That's not the problem right there.
There are um,

2768
02:01:44,270 --> 02:01:49,270
peaceful Muslim societies and very 
violent Christian woods and you can 

2769
02:01:49,270 --> 02:01:49,870
correlate it with Christianity.
Um,

2770
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,160
I think the one thing you can,
there are democracy.

2771
02:01:52,161 --> 02:01:57,161
There were their oppressive societies 
are very low violence and their full 

2772
02:01:57,161 --> 02:01:59,060
democracies like us,
we lots of violence.

2773
02:01:59,061 --> 02:02:00,920
So it's not the democratic system,
right?

2774
02:02:00,921 --> 02:02:03,830
Like what is it in my guests and it's 
only a guest.

2775
02:02:04,220 --> 02:02:08,230
My guest is that a certain amount of the
high suicide rates,

2776
02:02:08,290 --> 02:02:10,400
high depression,
anxiety,

2777
02:02:10,401 --> 02:02:12,200
drug addiction,
porn addiction,

2778
02:02:12,350 --> 02:02:17,350
child abuse,
mass shootings and shootings in the 

2779
02:02:17,350 --> 02:02:19,961
streets.
My guess is that the common denominator 

2780
02:02:19,961 --> 02:02:23,351
in all those things is the true 
catastrophic lack of communal connection

2781
02:02:24,711 --> 02:02:27,650
that many Americans experience.
Well,

2782
02:02:27,710 --> 02:02:28,070
it's,

2783
02:02:28,190 --> 02:02:32,960
it's a very compelling argument.
It's a very compelling point that again,

2784
02:02:32,961 --> 02:02:36,710
I don't see being discussed in very many
other areas and I really appreciate it,

2785
02:02:36,711 --> 02:02:37,880
man.
I really appreciate your book.

2786
02:02:38,030 --> 02:02:39,470
I think it's great and,
uh,

2787
02:02:39,471 --> 02:02:41,990
I really suggest anybody's interested in
the subject.

2788
02:02:41,991 --> 02:02:44,000
Please go read it.
Tribe Sebastian younger.

2789
02:02:44,060 --> 02:02:45,080
Thank you brother.
Appreciate it man.

2790
02:02:45,081 --> 02:02:46,760
I really enjoyed it.
Thank you very much.

2791
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:47,840
Anytime.
Come by.

2792
02:02:48,060 --> 02:02:49,700
Alright,
thanks everybody.

2793
02:02:52,160 --> 02:02:52,550
Awesome.
