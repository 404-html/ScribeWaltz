00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:11,830
shroom tech.
I'm Yoon.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,420
What is all this stuff I'm talking
about?

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,730
These are all new tropics.
What does that mean?

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,830
Google it bitch.
Go to g,

8
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:18,940
O,
G,

9
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,630
l e entering all the information that
you're interested in getting because

10
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,910
need to find out what the fuck you're
putting in your body.

11
00:00:24,911 --> 00:00:27,340
I tell people to Google Shit,
don't just buy our products.

12
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:28,300
This is what I'm saying.
What it is,

13
00:00:28,301 --> 00:00:33,301
is their nutrients that are designed and
engineered to improve the way your brain

14
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:38,290
produces neurotransmitters.
It's a very complicated and a very

15
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,440
controversial subject,
but uh,

16
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,910
they do work.
There are a lot of clinical studies

17
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:45,280
there on,
on at.com you can find the references to

18
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:48,250
all the different things,
ingredients and what they've been proven

19
00:00:48,251 --> 00:00:48,900
to do.

20
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,870
Uh,
I believe in it.

21
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:53,230
I believe in it so much that we have a
100% money back guarantee in the first

22
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:55,480
30 pills.
Nobody wants anybody to feel ripped off.

23
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,700
We're just trying to sell you good shit
that we use.

24
00:00:57,701 --> 00:01:00,980
So if you're interested and you go to
[inaudible] dot com use the code name

25
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:02,530
Brogan,
save yourself 10% off.

26
00:01:02,531 --> 00:01:04,240
But as I said,
if you have first started pills,

27
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:06,970
100% money back guarantee,
you don't even have to return it.

28
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,140
Just say,
this isn't for me,

29
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,150
and that's it,
or business has done,

30
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,380
but we,
uh,

31
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:13,120
we hope you will enjoy it and we hope
you'll,

32
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:13,871
you'll,
uh,

33
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:16,060
it'll enhance your brain's son.
Also,

34
00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:18,610
we have kettle bells and battle ropes.
These are the,

35
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:22,360
the newest additions to ana.com.
If you've never worked out with

36
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:24,750
kettlebells before,
don't get crazy and meathead,

37
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,670
you really don't need anything more than
a 35 pound kettle bell for the first

38
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:28,030
time.

39
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:28,781
And you're like,
Joe,

40
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:31,300
you don't even know me.
You don't even know how swole I am.

41
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,670
35 pounds.
The fuck am I going to do with that?

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,780
For Real,
there's a,

43
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,940
there's a video that I use called
extreme kettlebell cardio

44
00:01:36,941 --> 00:01:39,400
workouts@dragondoor.com.
It's incredible.

45
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:40,840
15.
Yes,

46
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,690
I just start out with a 10.
You can do whatever the fuck you want.

47
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,980
I started off with the cat or you can go
crazy and prove me wrong and use a 50 if

48
00:01:47,981 --> 00:01:50,770
you're a fucking savage.
But my point is it's not,

49
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,960
uh,
it's incredible workout.

50
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,080
Great for you,
and it's great for functional strength.

51
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,410
You know,
moving things,

52
00:01:56,411 --> 00:01:58,840
picking things up.
Your whole body will work as one unit.

53
00:01:58,841 --> 00:02:00,490
That is what kettlebells are designed
for.

54
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,930
All right.
You know what the fuck I'm talking

55
00:02:01,931 --> 00:02:04,450
about.
Let's get the thing ruin.

56
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,980
Hit the hit the music.
Brian,

57
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,873
let's start this thing.

58
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,810
Which town?

59
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:11,643
Okay.

60
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,710
Hey,
Joe Rogan podcast.

61
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,650
We're joined today by the world's
coolest wine maker.

62
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,780
What's up brother?
I their first because I've never

63
00:02:23,781 --> 00:02:25,130
actually met Brian.
Some kind of,

64
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,180
yeah,
he's a weird motherfucker.

65
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,660
Trust me.
Kind of make me nervous,

66
00:02:29,661 --> 00:02:31,010
so I'm just going to get and make you
more nervous.

67
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:33,110
As time goes on.
As he's looking at me,

68
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,990
he's going to have a few comments that
are just getting my God dude,

69
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:38,630
just looking at me.
Look right at me.

70
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,340
He does.
He does.

71
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:41,390
Look at people.
It's,

72
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,030
he doesn't know the effect it has on
folks.

73
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:49,820
How the fuck do you go from being a rock
star to being a rock star slash wine

74
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,840
maker?
What was the,

75
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:53,120
it was just a whim.
Did you have this idea?

76
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,720
I think the biggest,
the biggest hurdle there you have to get

77
00:02:56,721 --> 00:02:58,790
over is it,
I don't think I've ever really been a

78
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,790
rock.
I've actually dabbled in the rock star

79
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:01,624
stuff,

80
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,823
you know,
um,

81
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,810
Allah American psycho.
But uh,

82
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,780
for the most part it was just kind of me
putting it on.

83
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,700
I've always kind of been a small town
kid,

84
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,560
uh,
working in the garden.

85
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,890
So you think of yourself as just a human
being who likes to do things that are

86
00:03:15,891 --> 00:03:17,450
interesting and this is what's
interesting to you.

87
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,160
You know,
I've done things over the years and just

88
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:23,920
get,
get inspired and do more things and then

89
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:26,830
all sudden accidentally over along the
way somewhere you,

90
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,830
you make a few dollars on something and
I just go home,

91
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,360
great.
Then I can do more stuff.

92
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,890
But even the way you did this is so
uniquely you,

93
00:03:33,891 --> 00:03:34,760
you know,
you didn't,

94
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,480
you didn't do it in Sonoma county.
You didn't take an established orchard

95
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,960
orchard rather than in it,
you know,

96
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:41,210
and take over it.
You know,

97
00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:44,060
you went to a weird place,
you went to fucking Arizona.

98
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,470
You know,
people think of Arizona,

99
00:03:45,471 --> 00:03:49,600
you think of kidnappings and in Mexico,
and you know,

100
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,440
that's the thing.
You don't think of Nice tea.

101
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,800
Yeah.
You don't think of wine vineyards.

102
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,860
Uh,
well,

103
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,580
a historic

104
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,413
glee,
almost,

105
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,390
almost every state that could actually
sustain grapes,

106
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,010
uh,
vinifera.

107
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:06,660
So European grapes,
almost every state had vineyards and

108
00:04:06,661 --> 00:04:09,390
Haley and prohibition just threw a
wrench,

109
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,310
stuck,
told him monkey wrench in that.

110
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,950
And we can go down the whole conspiracy
theory regarding,

111
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:14,860
uh,

112
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,240
prohibition.
Oh yeah.

113
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:17,230
Well,
it's a beautiful one.

114
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,250
Yeah.
It's real.

115
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,250
It's still working today with marijuana.
Yeah.

116
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,880
And same,
same people.

117
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,833
Right.
So it's,

118
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,260
so that pretty much what that did is it
just interrupted our appreciation for

119
00:04:27,261 --> 00:04:27,330
what

120
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,140
wine,
uh,

121
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,240
as a,
as a daily part in Europe.

122
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:33,780
And that's why European wines became so
much more popular than American wines.

123
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,890
Right.
You know,

124
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,820
but they have,
they have

125
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,640
some places in Europe have had thousands
of years to develop what's going on on

126
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:42,590
there,
on that particular spot.

127
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:47,390
They've had like just decades and
centuries of notes,

128
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,070
uh,
whether on the terrain,

129
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:51,110
on the results,
on the process.

130
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,860
So they're so far ahead of us in terms
of just understanding those things and

131
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:55,940
it's part of their culture.

132
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,580
It's the ground and the soil and what
minerals and story with people who have

133
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:04,110
not had any experience with farming
might not know,

134
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:06,510
but they vary wildly from place to
place.

135
00:05:06,511 --> 00:05:10,710
How do you find the right spot if it
hasn't had a vineyard there before?

136
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:12,960
Or do you just say,
this is a good spot?

137
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,980
Let's you know,

138
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,980
you,
you join the military,

139
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,180
you get out of the military,
you form a band,

140
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,900
take $1 million,
you go dump that million dollars into a

141
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:29,320
fucking black hole in the middle of
nowhere and then go,

142
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:31,720
well that was the wrong hole and you
move over here and you're digging

143
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:33,520
another hole.
How many times did you do?

144
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,990
Oh God.
Oh,

145
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:36,430
she did a few,
well,

146
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:38,770
there's a couple of sites.
It's just our working what we've tried.

147
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,750
So it's basically it to like,
um,

148
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,500
get a printer.
They can actually print money that looks

149
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:48,190
real and uh,
make sure you keep changing the

150
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:50,830
cartridges.
So did you have to buy new land

151
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,110
[inaudible] no,
you end up,

152
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,720
well,
I mean you just have to pick the right

153
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:57,710
variety for that spot.
So if you're pretty,

154
00:05:57,711 --> 00:05:58,010
if you have

155
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,620
a pretty good idea that an area
consisting good grapes there that are

156
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,463
going to make,
you know,

157
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,360
uh,
the kind of wine you want to drink,

158
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,630
um,
then it's a matter of figuring out what

159
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:10,580
varietals going to work best there.
I mean,

160
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:13,940
we're not trying to grow,
we're not trying to grow wine and grow

161
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:15,410
grapes in,
in Alaska.

162
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,780
That's going to be hard.
You're going to have to really hard

163
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:20,060
pressed to find the right volume that
Alicia grow their,

164
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:20,961
uh,
you know,

165
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:23,810
we have Canadian ice wine.
You have like a lot of the American

166
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:27,710
hybrids to like vet all Blanca and
Norton and knows kind of grapes that

167
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:30,680
will grow in that extreme cold
temperatures.

168
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,600
Uh,
not a lot of daylight.

169
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,130
Um,
it's,

170
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:39,140
it really ripe in the Vinifera.
But in our area we have everything is

171
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,300
that everything's there,
everything's set up.

172
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,540
So it's just a matter of finding in that
particular location that you dumped all

173
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:45,710
your money into this land.

174
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,920
Like it figured out what grows there and
it's not going to be,

175
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,840
it's probably not going to be what you
think is going to grow.

176
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:53,180
There's going to be something else and
it's going to take a lot of trial and

177
00:06:53,181 --> 00:06:56,900
error and you know,
$40,000 an acre to find out.

178
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,370
So you have to try different grapes and
then go through a full season and then

179
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:02,520
test the results.
Well,

180
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,110
you know,
it's,

181
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,200
it's more like a,
it's more like just looking at the soil

182
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,020
and uh,
and that and that particular terrain and

183
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:11,090
where it is and how it's oriented north,
south,

184
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:14,510
east,
west and then try to pick the right

185
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:17,600
grape for that site before you put
anything on the ground,

186
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,310
figure out what great might work there.
Now this is a natural resource process

187
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:23,750
for you.
Is it something that you knew about

188
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:25,370
already?
Because you were interested in it or did

189
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:27,620
you have to learn all this as you went
along and had to learn?

190
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,410
I learned the hard way.
So you know when you put the vine in the

191
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:33,740
ground you don't know for,
well you might,

192
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,180
if it comes,
you know,

193
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,540
if it sticks around the next year
within,

194
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,200
you know you're at least you've got that
part,

195
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,980
then you know I'd actually grew,
then you've got to figure it up.

196
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,330
It's going to get the point where you
can actually train it to start,

197
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,560
you know,
setting fruit on it.

198
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,470
So you're not going to see fruit on that
vine.

199
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,500
You can probably push it and get some
fruit on there the third year.

200
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:54,500
But if you really want quality fruit and
want to just let the plant really

201
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,480
sinking,
find its way,

202
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,130
get the root system to get the whole
structure of it a happy and healthy and

203
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:04,670
then set fruit on it on the fourth year.
And then you make the wine out of that

204
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:07,400
fruit in the fourth year and then get to
try it like in its fifth year.

205
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,880
So five years down the road after having
planted those vines,

206
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:11,930
you go,
well,

207
00:08:11,931 --> 00:08:14,240
that wine sucks.
Oh Man,

208
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,140
what the fuck?
Yeah.

209
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,790
And there's no other way you can do
that.

210
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:24,740
There's no other like high tech DNA.
It's not necessarily determine lens,

211
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,430
right?
Yeah.

212
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,350
If you have,
if you have,

213
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,850
like if you're in California,
in Napa Valley and you've got a vineyard

214
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:31,880
over here and a vineyard over there,
chances are the vineyard right here in

215
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:34,880
the middle is probably going to do okay.
Then you'll know what to grow by,

216
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,830
what everyone around you is.
You have a history,

217
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:38,270
but we have no history.
You're,

218
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,550
you know,
you're guessing you're,

219
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,090
you're trying to make it work.
And we're finding now through trial and

220
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:45,740
error and you know,
many,

221
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:48,800
many dollars later,
we're finding that the Italian and

222
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:51,710
Spanish and varietals and southern Rhone
varietals are doing pretty well.

223
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,680
It,
what was the motivation to do this in

224
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:55,514
such,

225
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,000
you know,
sort of,

226
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,730
uh,
from the beginning manner,

227
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:00,560
you know,
I mean,

228
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,030
you,
you went at it about as his most

229
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:07,110
difficult path as possible to creating a
wa to creating a wine.

230
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,750
Um,
it's just,

231
00:09:08,751 --> 00:09:12,320
it was where I lived and just having
traveled around the world,

232
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:17,210
seeing other regions that kind of
resembled those regions and uh,

233
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,523
I dunno,
I Kinda,

234
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,820
I'm the on the,
uh,

235
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,350
the contrarian,
you know,

236
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,540
say one thing.
I'm going to go the other way just to

237
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,810
balance things out.
So just looking at that place,

238
00:09:26,811 --> 00:09:28,580
I just thought,
okay,

239
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,030
I have an idea.
You're looking off your back porch.

240
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:33,080
I'm looking at Atlanta.
I said,

241
00:09:33,081 --> 00:09:33,914
I go,
okay.

242
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,920
Um,
this sounds like a,

243
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,510
I want to try this.
Cause how many other vineyards are in

244
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:39,860
Arizona?
Uh,

245
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,110
well there's,
there are now,

246
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:46,430
when I first started there was about 20,
maybe 18 bonded wineries.

247
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,170
Now there's about 50.
Wow.

248
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,480
You model yourself after them.
I would look at like what soil they're

249
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,140
using,
whether it's similar to yours.

250
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:56,130
Did you have like,
you know,

251
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,300
anything to go on?

252
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,480
Not really,
no.

253
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:01,030
I mean,
I had a guy from a UC Davis come out and

254
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,370
kind of chase his tail a little bit and
look at it and go,

255
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,710
luck.
Now,

256
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,780
do you have to treat the soil in any
way?

257
00:10:07,781 --> 00:10:10,750
Do you have to mulch it or not
necessarily you and you have to make

258
00:10:10,751 --> 00:10:12,910
some soil adjustments if,
if really needed.

259
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:14,200
But you know,
in a perfect world,

260
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:16,690
you don't do any of that.
He just let it be what it's going to be.

261
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,580
So,
because you want to really express that

262
00:10:18,581 --> 00:10:21,730
place as much as you can and you want
to,

263
00:10:21,731 --> 00:10:23,060
you want to help,
uh,

264
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,540
the mines along.
If there,

265
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,590
if there is some nutrient deficiencies
as you go,

266
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:29,020
you'll,
you'll notice right away in the vines,

267
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,430
um,
if you're paying attention,

268
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,140
but you can also test for it.
You know,

269
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,170
they did little petioles tat and like
the ends of the vine,

270
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,540
you'd send a man who just see what's in
them and what's not in them.

271
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:42,040
So there'll be able to tell you roughly
what kind of a wine it'll produce.

272
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,110
A No,
they'll just let you know whether the

273
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,780
plant is healthy.
Uh,

274
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,640
so what needs nutrients?
So,

275
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,480
whether or not,
I mean we could plant,

276
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,381
uh,
like I said,

277
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:54,640
we can plan American hybrids there and
they'll do great thrive look,

278
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,890
look awesome.
But the wine's crap.

279
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:57,923
You know,
you know,

280
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,270
uh,
wine made out of Norton this,

281
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:04,240
it's very rare that you have somebody
who will impress you with a glass of

282
00:11:04,241 --> 00:11:06,280
Norton.
I don't even know what Norton is.

283
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:12,070
Manischewitz it's equivalent.
The first time I ever heard about an

284
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,470
area making things taste differently
was,

285
00:11:14,471 --> 00:11:16,210
uh,
I had a friend who was really in Cuban

286
00:11:16,211 --> 00:11:17,460
cigars.
Tommy,

287
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,440
you have this Vl,
oh,

288
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:22,960
I forget what the name of this one area
of tube is,

289
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,930
but it's a small area,
you know,

290
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,160
and it's,
it's a few hundred acres or something

291
00:11:27,161 --> 00:11:27,490
like that.

292
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,100
And in that few hundred acres,
they produce all the worlds,

293
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,670
Cuban cigars,
and it's just whatever's in that soil,

294
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,410
just making it up that much about
cigars.

295
00:11:35,411 --> 00:11:37,270
But I know I've had people hand me,
okay,

296
00:11:37,271 --> 00:11:39,700
here's,
here's three different cigars,

297
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,620
um,
that have the little thing.

298
00:11:41,621 --> 00:11:45,460
He repped off it and try them out.
You know who I liked that one Cuban.

299
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,970
It's amazing how strong they are.
It's amazing.

300
00:11:47,971 --> 00:11:50,470
Like what it actually does to you.
Like it's a fucking drug.

301
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,550
Like if you have a good solid cigar,
like,

302
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,351
and you're like,
Whoa,

303
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:55,520
like I'm high right now.
This is a real,

304
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,750
yeah,
you get motivated to do things.

305
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,490
We had a guy in here yesterday,
Rob Wolf was a nutritionist.

306
00:12:01,491 --> 00:12:02,530
She was telling us that,
uh,

307
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,640
creativity is enhanced by nicotine,
gum,

308
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,430
nicotine.
It's actually not bad for you.

309
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:08,380
It's bad for you is all the shit that's
in cigarettes.

310
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,570
Right.
But the nicotine itself actually,

311
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,670
you know,
so a positive drug,

312
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,860
just hard for us to wrap our heads
around.

313
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:15,850
So,
uh,

314
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,850
you,
you,

315
00:12:16,851 --> 00:12:21,070
you found this spot and how many years
did it take you to you producing what

316
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:23,050
you have here today?
You have two wines here today.

317
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,160
Yeah.
Um,

318
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,353
these,
uh,

319
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,210
this,
the,

320
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,140
the rosacea that I brought,
this is the Lelea Nebbiolo Rosé.

321
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,010
This is from our southern Arizona
Vineyard that we actually purchased.

322
00:12:32,011 --> 00:12:33,700
It was an existing vineyard,
uh,

323
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:34,980
and,
and,

324
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,340
uh,
Graham County area.

325
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:39,160
It's called Bonita springs been here.
So I've been,

326
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:39,880
you know,
with my,

327
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,620
cause I have,
well three,

328
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:46,230
three wineries,
a caduceus and American vineyards or are

329
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,170
my,
my label,

330
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:50,590
I make these wines.
And then Arizona stronghold is my sister

331
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:53,440
company and I'm an investor and Co
founder of that company.

332
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:56,810
And that company bought these two
existing vineyards.

333
00:12:56,811 --> 00:12:57,700
Dennis Southern Arizona.

334
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,600
So there's the Arizona strong open,
your coachees county out and Wilcox and

335
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:03,370
then the Benita springs vineyard in
Graham County.

336
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,000
So this is most of your focus right now
is making wine.

337
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,270
When do you just very well when it,
when it comes to harvest time,

338
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,470
that's,
that's where I have to be.

339
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,510
Cause there's,
there's no other way around it.

340
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,270
It's,
that's,

341
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,560
you know,
my wife runs the lab and I make the

342
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:18,910
wine.
So when it's harvest time,

343
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,820
uh,
Monday,

344
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,130
so starting Monday you gather up the
grapes and then start the process of

345
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:28,440
turning them into wine.
So it's a,

346
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,171
it's,
it'll,

347
00:13:29,171 --> 00:13:30,460
it'll go on through,
you know,

348
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,900
we'll see our first,
uh,

349
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,050
we'll see our first white's probably
around the first week of August.

350
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,250
So I had to basically be back there to
just get ready and getting everything

351
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:40,660
ready.
What is the process,

352
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,800
the fermentation process?

353
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,990
I know you gather up the wine or you
gather up the grapes,

354
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,970
rather you smash them and then what
happens?

355
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,983
Well,
it depends on,

356
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,760
depends on how you,
how you do it.

357
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,560
There's some,
there's some people that,

358
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,450
uh,
you do the harvest,

359
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:54,640
you bring them in and you actually
destem the grapes.

360
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,790
You put him into December and it's kind
of like a big tumbler and the grapes

361
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,300
fall through these holes and these
little paddles and knock the stems out

362
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,550
the end.
And then they'll fall into either a

363
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,940
crusher that just kind of pop them and
puts them into the bin.

364
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:10,510
And you now they're pumped them into a
tank or you put them in a bin and your

365
00:14:10,511 --> 00:14:12,580
friend in that way,
or has it just stemmed,

366
00:14:12,581 --> 00:14:15,450
you just leave them whole berry and
that's carbonic masturbation.

367
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,860
And so that's more like a peanut Anwar
process.

368
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,830
So the produce different results,
whether they have a stem or not.

369
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,720
Uh,
I think personally it might,

370
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,610
my choices,
I do all my wines,

371
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,490
all the reds.
I do them a carbonic masturbation with

372
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,750
the whole berry.
Um,

373
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,870
cause I feel like just in the results
when you crush him,

374
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,280
sometimes,
depending on the region,

375
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,050
uh,
the,

376
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,390
the skins and the stems and the seeds,
uh,

377
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,240
you know,
seeds and the seeds and skins mainly

378
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,120
when you crush them,
we actually have more exposure to those

379
00:14:43,121 --> 00:14:45,610
kind of like negative tannins,
kind of like a green,

380
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,650
uh,
tannins and bitter that don't quite,

381
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,890
you know,
they don't necessarily precipitate out.

382
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,990
How did you get involved in all this?
Is this something you've always been

383
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:58,670
fascinated with or did you just one day
get into it and never looked back?

384
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,691
Um,
it's,

385
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,130
I think it's,
you know,

386
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:01,841
I grew up,
you know,

387
00:15:01,841 --> 00:15:05,130
working in fruit orchards and my dad had
a garden and uh,

388
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,150
so I think it's just kind of,
I kind of fall into it a little bit,

389
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,350
you know,
reluctantly back then.

390
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,940
Of course you hate it.
You don't want to weed,

391
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:13,370
you know what to look for the cut or if
you don't want to like do all that

392
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,300
stuff.
But then when you look back on you

393
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,160
actually that was pretty,
that was pretty cool.

394
00:15:18,161 --> 00:15:19,810
It's hands on,
you know,

395
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,770
when you see what's the food on your
table,

396
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,930
you know,
as a teenager you don't get it,

397
00:15:23,931 --> 00:15:28,100
but later on you go.
We made that actually gets you from Ohio

398
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:29,810
originally.
Originally from Ohio.

399
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,800
Um,
I'm also from an io.

400
00:15:31,801 --> 00:15:34,220
Awesome.
I'm also from Ohio also.

401
00:15:34,221 --> 00:15:36,830
And so I also left.
He left to go to Michigan.

402
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,400
Ah,
I see what's going on.

403
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,043
And as a,
you know,

404
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,600
just as a thank you for letting me
leave,

405
00:15:45,601 --> 00:15:48,890
but we gave you Detroit.
So Detroit is now in northern Ohio or I

406
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,230
welcome still alive.
That's sweet.

407
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,940
Bears are moving into Detroit.

408
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,920
So can we try some of this stuff?
No,

409
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,540
I mean,
yes to smell it.

410
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,580
Anything.
You can try it here.

411
00:15:58,581 --> 00:15:59,900
I'll call you one of these.
Do you,

412
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:02,150
uh,
do you still do a lot of art?

413
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,930
Because I knew you went to college for
art and a lot of your,

414
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,950
your videos are very art based.
Uh,

415
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,570
do you personally do any arts still or
uh,

416
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,710
or were you really ever into doing it?
I think it was more like the director or

417
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,680
producer,
you know,

418
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,020
I was kind of into the coordinating of
getting artists in a room to do things.

419
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:21,470
But,
uh,

420
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,750
as far as the actual talent,
I can't,

421
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,880
I can't play piano.
I can't play guitar.

422
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,870
I can barely draw.
How did you become the lead singer of a

423
00:16:29,871 --> 00:16:34,070
band then?
Accidentally I was the loudest asshole

424
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:35,870
in the room.
You were the most bold.

425
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,960
That was a guy who thought I had
something to say.

426
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,221
Well,
uh,

427
00:16:40,221 --> 00:16:41,180
Doug,
your music man.

428
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:44,210
But of course like everybody,
but I really became a fan when I read

429
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,920
this piece that you wrote on Hixon
Gracie.

430
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,110
Why?
Uh,

431
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,500
you know,
you just,

432
00:16:49,501 --> 00:16:53,580
you just nailed it.
Nailed the whole balance of the balance

433
00:16:53,581 --> 00:16:55,190
article and yeah.
Yeah.

434
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,270
And Hixon himself was a fascinating guy.
Well,

435
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,020
he's a very few people that I've met
that you,

436
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,070
you meet him and like right away,
you know,

437
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:05,630
there's something different about this
cat.

438
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,930
And uh,
Hixon is incredibly intense guy.

439
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:12,230
That's,
it's so rare you find a real martial

440
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:16,370
arts master.
So sort of a cliche term that we,

441
00:17:16,371 --> 00:17:16,851
uh,
you know,

442
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:17,860
we think of an,
you know,

443
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,100
terms of like movies.
The one man who is the master who has it

444
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:23,400
all in control.
Well,

445
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:28,160
not to take anything away from Hixson,
but I've actually learned more from

446
00:17:28,161 --> 00:17:31,430
training with boiler boilers.
What amazing.

447
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:32,740
Yeah.
Boiler and uh,

448
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,780
Carlos Machado.
Uh,

449
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,280
cause we got to travel around.
I just,

450
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:41,660
I can't train consistently,
so I can't just walk into a Dojo and

451
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:45,290
just throw my gay and expect not to have
my ass handed to me and then not be able

452
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:46,220
to do the show.
Right,

453
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:46,790
right,
right.

454
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,271
So,
you know,

455
00:17:47,271 --> 00:17:48,980
I was just do privates and I just do
them.

456
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,943
The guys who

457
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,510
are as old or older than me,
so they don't have anything to prove.

458
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,181
So it's just like,
hey,

459
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:55,800
let's just have some fun.
And,

460
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:57,870
uh,
I'd rather than trying to put a notch in

461
00:17:57,871 --> 00:17:59,250
their belt with my blood,

462
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,440
well,
none of the older guys would do that

463
00:18:03,441 --> 00:18:04,101
anyway.
The,

464
00:18:04,101 --> 00:18:05,200
uh,
especially the,

465
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,070
I mean when you get to the black belt
level,

466
00:18:07,071 --> 00:18:09,320
no one's trying to,
they're very cool about it.

467
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,080
But you know,
I can't just walk into a room and just

468
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,850
dive into a class.
Yeah.

469
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,220
Not at,
not at the age of 48 going on 50.

470
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,690
Did you used to do that?
Did you take classes

471
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,710
earlier on?
And that's how I got injured.

472
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,300
You walk into the wrong place that they
think for some reason you're,

473
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,580
you know,
challenging their manhood and all of a

474
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:25,960
sudden it's like,
dude,

475
00:18:25,961 --> 00:18:28,030
I'm in.
At that point I only weighed like one

476
00:18:28,031 --> 00:18:30,640
35.
So you're rolling into any,

477
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,620
any Dojo we're rolling into a year.
Like,

478
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,020
you know,
you might as well be somebody's child.

479
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:39,390
The real problem is that a blue belt,
purple belt stage where you're just

480
00:18:39,391 --> 00:18:43,100
trying to get as many kills as you can.
And it's like anyone that comes in,

481
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:44,850
I'll look at this guy.
He's only 140 pounds.

482
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:46,410
So that's a kill.
I'm going to get this one.

483
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:47,430
I'm going,
it's not ignoring you.

484
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:50,400
I'm looking for the photo of boiler so I
can prove that I actually did that.

485
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:52,483
No,
I,

486
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,910
no idea.
I've seen here,

487
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,470
I've seen photos of you and Dave camp,
Mario and Bj Penn and I'm sure this

488
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,101
wine,
by the way,

489
00:18:59,101 --> 00:19:00,450
it's delicious.
Yeah.

490
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:01,880
What kind is this?
What does this,

491
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:03,510
this is a Rosa,
Rosa and Nebbiolo.

492
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,920
There's,
there's my whole life.

493
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:11,810
I just saw him recently and he says one
of his fighters fought in the UFC a

494
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,390
couple of weeks ago.

495
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:16,300
I don't know if that will show up.
Nope.

496
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:21,330
I can see his hairline.
Incredible family.

497
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:27,000
I want to talk about a family that's had
an impact on martial arts.

498
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,410
Really,
it an amazing thing that in the 1990s

499
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:33,990
with all we thought we knew about
martial arts,

500
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:37,170
it's one family from Brazil can have
this monstrous impact.

501
00:19:37,171 --> 00:19:38,470
And it's funny how like,

502
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:43,930
well now you know that.
And do you still see guys pimping there?

503
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,370
You know,
dance theater,

504
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,020
sort of much,
much more rare,

505
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,370
square dance,
much more rare than ever before.

506
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,141
You know,
there's,

507
00:19:52,141 --> 00:19:57,130
there's still a few holdouts that are
teaching some silly form of something.

508
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,340
Had A,
I had a friend who was working with a

509
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,560
band and,
um,

510
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,970
he's,
you know,

511
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,860
a solid practitioner,
uh,

512
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,320
finally got his black belt.
Um,

513
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,780
and uh,
but he doesn't even,

514
00:20:09,781 --> 00:20:12,810
he did security.
He's doing mainly a director of security

515
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:16,260
and for these different tours.
And this particular one,

516
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,060
you know,
he wasn't doing any martial arts.

517
00:20:18,061 --> 00:20:21,000
I've just like doing his job and
directing what was going on.

518
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,590
And then one of the artists was flying
this guy in and paying them all this

519
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:29,640
money to do this Kung Fu stuff.
You know,

520
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,710
he's being respectful.
He's just letting that like,

521
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,340
and not my place to even insert into
that,

522
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:36,390
but like,
you know,

523
00:20:36,391 --> 00:20:40,260
he's would always like to angle into
getting an opportunity on the road

524
00:20:40,261 --> 00:20:42,630
because when you're traveling,
trying to train and try to do this stuff

525
00:20:42,631 --> 00:20:44,340
is,
it's almost impossible.

526
00:20:44,341 --> 00:20:45,570
It's really hard to do.

527
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:46,950
Um,
and so,

528
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,330
you know,
if there's any way he can work into at

529
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,420
least getting to train with them,
that'd be great.

530
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:53,380
So,
you know,

531
00:20:53,381 --> 00:20:55,000
whenever the opportunity presented
itself,

532
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:55,421
he was like,
you know,

533
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,254
I,
I also would,

534
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,360
you know,
try not to do a Jujitsu.

535
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,660
The love to jump in with you guys at
some point is to get a workout in or

536
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:04,480
something.
And the guy basically said,

537
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,400
look,
if I'm,

538
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:07,990
you know,
it wasn't responding to him.

539
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,300
So he's like finally went,
look,

540
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,620
you know,
what we do is like,

541
00:21:11,621 --> 00:21:13,470
you know,
university level that,

542
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,800
that Jujitsu thing is like kindergarten.
Some of my buddies like,

543
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,873
oh,
okay,

544
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,790
it's on.
So he calls,

545
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,380
he calls Hanzo and says,
Hanzo,

546
00:21:24,381 --> 00:21:26,560
I'm on the east coast.
I need a place to go train.

547
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:28,030
And this is what happened in hands.
I was like,

548
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,810
what the bring them with a fucking come
from other fuck it down to the,

549
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,660
it was so amazing that like silicon,
all this guy is now,

550
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:36,080
he's kind of cornered,
he's into,

551
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,230
he's kind of basically challenged my
friend and my,

552
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,590
and my friends trying to be as
respectful as possible.

553
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,840
I'm just going to,
the guy just kept going and going about

554
00:21:43,841 --> 00:21:45,010
with,
you know,

555
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:45,781
uh,
the,

556
00:21:45,781 --> 00:21:47,590
just the disrespect talk.
That's how,

557
00:21:47,591 --> 00:21:50,080
you know he sucks.
Most likely it was,

558
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,990
and there's a video online of the
schooling and it was a,

559
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:54,510
Oh,
really?

560
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:58,510
The video that's online is,
it's after like,

561
00:21:58,990 --> 00:21:59,950
you know,
they started,

562
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:02,400
they did some stuff and it was over so
fast that finally handle it.

563
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:03,243
Kept going.
Okay,

564
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,680
now you can't,
you can't hit him.

565
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,550
You can't,
you can't tackle him.

566
00:22:07,551 --> 00:22:09,850
You can't use your arm.
Like he kept like taking things away

567
00:22:09,851 --> 00:22:13,850
from my guy,
still like to make it so that it was

568
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,420
just destroying.
Yeah.

569
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,460
And it was like,
just embarrassing.

570
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:20,080
So the guy who hasn't been paying this
guy,

571
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,570
this money this whole time is looking at
this going,

572
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:26,230
what the fuck have I been paying for?
Nonsense.

573
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:27,663
Yeah.

574
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,110
There's a lot of that out there were
dancing.

575
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,520
Well,
for the longest time,

576
00:22:31,521 --> 00:22:33,680
that was the majority of martial arts
was fuckery.

577
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,581
You know,
I mean,

578
00:22:34,581 --> 00:22:36,500
most of the schools you would find on
corners,

579
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,320
or my friend,
my friend Eddie had a guy that he was

580
00:22:39,321 --> 00:22:44,210
taking can food from and the guy went to
China to learn secret techniques under

581
00:22:44,211 --> 00:22:46,970
this deadly master.
And then he found the guy's supposed to

582
00:22:46,971 --> 00:22:49,010
be in China.
He found his fucking car at the

583
00:22:49,011 --> 00:22:51,180
supermarket parking lot.
He found the guy in the suit like get

584
00:22:51,181 --> 00:22:52,610
the fuck man.
I thought you were in China.

585
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,320
Oh yeah.
I mean I'm on my way to trips kind of

586
00:22:55,321 --> 00:22:56,880
town.
I was going to Chinatown.

587
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,240
It's uh,
you know,

588
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,740
it was secret.
It was a hustle for a long time.

589
00:23:00,741 --> 00:23:04,280
All you had to do was pretend you just
had to like throw some techniques that

590
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:06,890
you learned from,
I mean you could watch a John Claude van

591
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,140
Damme movie,
kind of get a good idea how he's moving

592
00:23:09,141 --> 00:23:12,650
his body and sort of recreate that.
And if you are really crazy,

593
00:23:12,651 --> 00:23:14,270
next thing you know,
you could have a school where you're

594
00:23:14,271 --> 00:23:17,810
teaching your own style of self defense.
That's completely ineffective.

595
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,120
I want to do when it's like a,
it's,

596
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,600
you know,
practical fighting where you're

597
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:22,650
actually,
you know,

598
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,360
you're going to be in a bar so you might
as well be drunk.

599
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:28,170
So we called it dear son dough and you
just show up and immediately kind a six

600
00:23:28,171 --> 00:23:29,004
pack and then we start.

601
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,560
That's a good idea,
right?

602
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,680
We've got to throw your chair away.
I know it's dead.

603
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,580
I think lunch you grab one of these
other ones that don't get used as much.

604
00:23:37,581 --> 00:23:39,920
Don't squeak as much.
Yeah.

605
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,930
Um,
I thought that was his back.

606
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,340
No,
but imagine if it was,

607
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,420
that would be a,
that would be one of the worst feelings

608
00:23:47,421 --> 00:23:49,550
ever.
If you dedicated a massive amount of

609
00:23:49,551 --> 00:23:53,060
your life to some bullshit and then it's
just exposed in front of you like that

610
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,280
right now.
It happens to a lot of martial artists,

611
00:23:55,281 --> 00:23:56,900
man.
I've met a lot of people who,

612
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,120
you know,
whether it was taekwondo or whatever,

613
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:03,350
traditional martial art that had a giant
hole in it and they didn't even realize

614
00:24:03,351 --> 00:24:04,171
that.
Well,

615
00:24:04,171 --> 00:24:05,420
it's the same with my friend.
He was like,

616
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,080
he was a black belt,
I think,

617
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,300
taekwondo and he will,
he rolled into a,

618
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,510
uh,
uh,

619
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,750
Rodrigo Bodgie his place in Saint Louis
and went,

620
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,040
okay,
you know,

621
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,140
whatever this is,
let me just show you.

622
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,550
And he just had his ass handed to him
like repeatedly.

623
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:23,990
Anyone.
Okay.

624
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,340
I'm sold.
Yeah.

625
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,440
It was a black belt in taekwondo before
ever did.

626
00:24:27,441 --> 00:24:29,380
You did so.
And when I first did Jujitsu,

627
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:33,260
there was this kid that I'll never
forget this purple belt kid my age,

628
00:24:33,261 --> 00:24:38,261
my size is nothing special about him.
And he's just maul me.

629
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:42,020
Every class he would maul me.
It was like I was a baby.

630
00:24:42,021 --> 00:24:44,840
Like I couldn't do anything to him.
I couldn't defend myself.

631
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,720
I'd be exhausted.
You just fucking strangle me and I have

632
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:51,650
to tap.
It was just so humiliating and humbling.

633
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,060
You know?
I remember thinking,

634
00:24:53,061 --> 00:24:54,740
Wow,
I was walking around,

635
00:24:54,741 --> 00:24:57,500
not even knowing somebody my size could
do that to me.

636
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,070
I have no idea.
Really had no idea.

637
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,350
So living in a completely delusional
world of martial arts,

638
00:25:03,351 --> 00:25:04,111
proudness.
Well,

639
00:25:04,111 --> 00:25:08,450
we have to remember that we,
the reason that we're a hair at all is

640
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,760
at some point during our human
development,

641
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:12,580
we,
you know,

642
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,460
instinctively and just accidentally
realized that we can't rely on our

643
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:17,360
strength or speed.

644
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,350
We had to rely on our brain.
So cause it,

645
00:25:20,351 --> 00:25:22,100
you know,
we don't just run out and grab the line

646
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:25,010
and rip its head off.
We either run from it and find a stick

647
00:25:25,011 --> 00:25:28,220
and sharpen it and you know,
go out in teams and you know,

648
00:25:28,221 --> 00:25:31,120
take down the elephant with five guys,
you know,

649
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,530
so that you know,
so when you think of martial arts in

650
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:37,100
that manner,
you start to realize how important the

651
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:39,740
mental game is as opposed to just the
physical game.

652
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:40,970
Well,
especially in Jujitsu,

653
00:25:40,971 --> 00:25:44,660
it's one of the rare martial arts were
technique is really the most important

654
00:25:44,661 --> 00:25:45,650
aspect of,
of,

655
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,700
of the practice.
And when you get a really big strong

656
00:25:49,701 --> 00:25:52,310
guy,
it's actually a disadvantage for a

657
00:25:52,311 --> 00:25:56,120
strong guy to learn Jujitsu because the
best technical guides are always small,

658
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,700
weaker guys cause they have to be
technical.

659
00:25:58,701 --> 00:26:00,800
Then there's nothing they can muscle or
force.

660
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,400
Whereas the big guys,
they can get away with some sloppy shit

661
00:26:04,401 --> 00:26:05,990
because of the fact that they're big and
strong.

662
00:26:05,991 --> 00:26:09,020
So they're really hindering themselves
by using strength.

663
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:11,390
I mean that's,
there's no sport like that and no

664
00:26:11,391 --> 00:26:14,820
martial art even like that.
I mean technique is very important.

665
00:26:14,821 --> 00:26:17,660
And kickboxing,
but athleticism and speed is equally

666
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:18,441
important.
You know,

667
00:26:18,441 --> 00:26:20,570
if you're,
if you're very technical but slow,

668
00:26:20,571 --> 00:26:22,250
it really won't work.
And the Jujitsu,

669
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:23,290
these guys,
the,

670
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,100
the,
the saddest thing about rolling with

671
00:26:25,101 --> 00:26:27,440
someone like a Hixon or as John John
Machado,

672
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,750
it's like they don't even try.
Like,

673
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:32,780
it's not like they're straining and
moving hardly to slowly,

674
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,790
oh my friend.
Oh,

675
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:36,380
you're on your back again.
Oh,

676
00:26:36,381 --> 00:26:38,540
you better protect this arm because this
is the one,

677
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,110
nine,
eight and seven.

678
00:26:42,111 --> 00:26:43,290
You're like,
what's he going to do?

679
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,660
And then he does it and you go,
okay,

680
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,780
Hixon would do that to black belts who
would pick an arm and tell them,

681
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,150
I'm going to get your right arm in an
arm bar.

682
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,680
And you're like,
there's no fucking way.

683
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:54,480
I'm just kidding.
Does it want to chicken my in this

684
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:57,210
mother fucker arms over there?
Like how are you going to get me in an

685
00:26:57,211 --> 00:26:58,740
arm bar?
And all of a sudden he's over there and

686
00:26:58,741 --> 00:27:00,490
you're tapping out.
Yeah,

687
00:27:00,491 --> 00:27:02,040
it's,
I didn't know that there was something

688
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:03,120
like that before.
And when you,

689
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,450
once you understand like how technical
Jujitsu is,

690
00:27:05,451 --> 00:27:08,840
it really become so fascinating.
Josh Waitzkin is a,

691
00:27:08,841 --> 00:27:12,930
a famous chess player.
He was the movie searching for Bobby

692
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:17,570
Fisher was based on him and he sort of
got disillusioned with Chaz after a

693
00:27:17,571 --> 00:27:21,510
while I got bored with it and devoted
the same energy to Jujitsu and he's one

694
00:27:21,511 --> 00:27:23,310
of Marcella Garcia,
his proteges now.

695
00:27:23,311 --> 00:27:27,810
And he has,
I think it's called a m m g J and

696
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:31,860
Marcella Garcia Jujitsu inaction Mgj and
action.com.

697
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,350
And um,
it's maybe Mgj Jay.

698
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,990
Um,
and it's,

699
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:37,530
um,
the,

700
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,870
the website,
he has it broken down the way you would

701
00:27:39,871 --> 00:27:40,770
break down chess.

702
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,140
Like he breaks down moves and as
different,

703
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,760
you know,
different transitions,

704
00:27:44,761 --> 00:27:46,460
different moves.
So you can look at it,

705
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:49,560
you know,
and much more may be analytical and you

706
00:27:49,561 --> 00:27:51,900
know,
a calculated move,

707
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,210
move way.
And then you would,

708
00:27:54,211 --> 00:27:56,670
if you were just over,
his name is Josh Waitzkin.

709
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,600
Okay.
Yeah,

710
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,740
there's the guy that,
or the trains out of a Hen's Oh,

711
00:28:01,741 --> 00:28:04,020
studio in New York.
I think his name's John.

712
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,390
John Donahoe maybe.
Yeah,

713
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:08,340
he's a beast.
And it's just like,

714
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,213
it's,
it's like,

715
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,850
it's like the chest.
He wants his brain going,

716
00:28:11,851 --> 00:28:12,810
okay,
this is,

717
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,960
this is this millimeter.
A philosophy student.

718
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,550
He was a university student and it was
bouncing.

719
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,560
That's what he was doing for fun,
you know,

720
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:25,410
or to to pay bills.
And along the way someone said,

721
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:26,940
hey,
she alerts and Jujitsu and he became

722
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:29,610
completely obsessed,
sleeps on the mats.

723
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,170
I mean literally teach us all day.

724
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,440
I mean don heard is a legend in Jujitsu
circles.

725
00:28:34,441 --> 00:28:37,320
He's a suit.
It's what happens when a super

726
00:28:37,321 --> 00:28:40,170
intelligent guy gets physically absorbed
in a sport.

727
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,730
Yeah.
He's just,

728
00:28:41,731 --> 00:28:42,660
uh,
he's,

729
00:28:42,661 --> 00:28:46,350
he works with a lot of top guys.
Like he's always in a George Saint

730
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,790
Pierre is corner,
he's a,

731
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:51,450
there's a lot of good guys that come out
of his jam and there's guys who give

732
00:28:51,451 --> 00:28:54,900
good instruction and this guys who suck
in the corner and the corner is some

733
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:57,540
guys who just,
you listened to them and I have to do

734
00:28:57,541 --> 00:29:00,990
everything I can and not criticize them
and get the fuck are you saying or that

735
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:03,010
guy like this is nonsense.
Like you don't,

736
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,540
you're better off saying nothing because
you're,

737
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,890
you're,
you're putting in like an air of despair

738
00:29:07,891 --> 00:29:10,320
and idiocy into this,
into this cage.

739
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,570
They say such stupid shit,
but not Donna,

740
00:29:12,571 --> 00:29:13,240
her man,
Donna.

741
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,980
Hers like Super Precise.
You need to hold your left hand slightly

742
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:19,770
higher.
Your Chin talked shoulders up,

743
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:23,550
move to your right side.
If he's throwing the left first doc on

744
00:29:23,551 --> 00:29:24,960
de,
then go for a single.

745
00:29:24,961 --> 00:29:28,080
The single does not work.
You transitioned to a double have water,

746
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,840
three deep breath and you're like,
Whoa,

747
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,230
this motherfucker just got schooled.
You know,

748
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,570
you hear him talk and you know,
this guy knows exactly what I'm supposed

749
00:29:36,571 --> 00:29:38,340
to do.
If I could just listen to this guy,

750
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:41,350
I think I'm going to be okay.
It's a crazy world.

751
00:29:41,351 --> 00:29:46,310
The world of intelligence and,
and risk and martial art and that's what

752
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:49,150
w you know,
people like for the wrong reasons.

753
00:29:49,151 --> 00:29:53,530
Associate martial arts and especially
associate competition with meatheads

754
00:29:53,531 --> 00:29:54,730
assholes,
dummies.

755
00:29:54,731 --> 00:29:58,960
But the most brilliant minds and some of
the most interesting people that I've

756
00:29:58,961 --> 00:30:00,730
ever met when martial arts
practitioners,

757
00:30:00,731 --> 00:30:04,540
because there's a certain amount of
calculation you have to do.

758
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:08,140
While under extreme duress and pressure
and there's a risk involved.

759
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,950
The risk is like physical health and all
those together created an incredible

760
00:30:11,951 --> 00:30:14,530
ward.
When you're successful in the reward is

761
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:17,770
amazing.
But the downside is like mad for most

762
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:20,260
people that the down is too low and they
avoid it.

763
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,270
And that's the people that can,
can make their way through those waters.

764
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:27,220
The,
the strongest salmon who get up that

765
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:29,980
waterfall to me,
some of the most interesting people that

766
00:30:29,981 --> 00:30:30,880
I've ever met.
Yup.

767
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,090
I would have to agree.
Yeah.

768
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,390
And that's what I got out of your
article.

769
00:30:34,391 --> 00:30:35,590
I was like,
this guy gets it.

770
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,280
He's,
you're,

771
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,660
you're seeing the essence of a,
of what this is all about.

772
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,220
How long have you been doing Jujitsu
now?

773
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:46,710
Uh,
I started in the mid to late nineties.

774
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,400
I got injured right around 2000 and I
have only done it,

775
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,800
you know,
on and off now whenever I can,

776
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,500
when you're,
when you're doing your wines,

777
00:30:55,501 --> 00:30:58,530
it must be like 16 hours a day.
My must be.

778
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,290
Uh,
well,

779
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,123
you know,
I'm pretty,

780
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:02,920
I'm pretty organized so I,
you know,

781
00:31:02,921 --> 00:31:06,480
I make sure that whatever I can,
whatever I can bring to the table as far

782
00:31:06,481 --> 00:31:09,720
as making things easier and smoother and
not getting in my own way,

783
00:31:09,721 --> 00:31:11,760
like just a lot of logistics and
understanding.

784
00:31:11,761 --> 00:31:15,360
Like if I do this,
I'm going to have to undo this and five

785
00:31:15,361 --> 00:31:17,460
moves.
So I always like,

786
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,620
I've laid things out in a manner that,
you know,

787
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:24,420
I'm in the winery around 6:00 AM six 30
but I'm wrapping it up around eight

788
00:31:24,421 --> 00:31:26,570
o'clock.
So you're a black belt in winemaking,

789
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,080
sweating,
trying to say I'm a black building

790
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:30,210
logistics,
blackbelt logistics,

791
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:33,540
just understanding the process and not
getting in my own way.

792
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:37,580
And then when you go from that mode into
musician mode,

793
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,920
do you just do it on based on your
schedule?

794
00:31:39,921 --> 00:31:41,780
Like whenever your time becomes free,
you go,

795
00:31:41,781 --> 00:31:42,411
okay.
You know,

796
00:31:42,411 --> 00:31:43,244
starting in

797
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,270
it's October or whatever,
a little bit more emotion,

798
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:49,420
a little bit more,
a random this with that.

799
00:31:49,421 --> 00:31:50,051
With that,
you know,

800
00:31:50,051 --> 00:31:52,330
you kind of have to kind of ride those
waves a little bit.

801
00:31:52,331 --> 00:31:54,940
But in a way,
when you have enough time under your

802
00:31:54,941 --> 00:31:58,360
belt,
you can kind of force the situation.

803
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,620
You can,
you know,

804
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:03,310
a lot of times I just get in my,
my truck and I got a decent stereo on

805
00:32:03,311 --> 00:32:05,140
the truck and I got the tracks and I
just,

806
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,770
that way nobody can mess with me.
I can't get a phone call and they'll be

807
00:32:08,771 --> 00:32:12,160
knocking on the door.
I just go park somewhere and turn the

808
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,080
music up.
But the notepad and start writing,

809
00:32:14,081 --> 00:32:16,080
cause nobody now you're in your world.
If he might,

810
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,030
if I'm in my house,
you know the phone's going to ring.

811
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:22,750
I'm going to check my email,
I'm going to try to ask a question.

812
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:24,850
Or you know,
males in,

813
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:28,180
you know,
oh it's that super troopers on HBO

814
00:32:28,181 --> 00:32:30,040
again.
So much for writing.

815
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,370
Yeah.
That's why.

816
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:33,040
Right when everyone's asleep.
I don't,

817
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:36,930
don't even start until 11:00 PM 12:00 PM
everyone in my house

818
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:39,210
asleep.
I liked it when people around me are

819
00:32:39,211 --> 00:32:40,040
asleep too.
I'd like

820
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,920
to think the neighbors are sleep.
I like to think that I'm not picking up

821
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:46,340
any weird vibes from anybody.
Everybody's in Z zone.

822
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,270
Right.
You know?

823
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,260
But do you,
um,

824
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,280
when you,
when you write,

825
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:52,350
do you have like specific times where
you set aside time to write?

826
00:32:52,351 --> 00:32:54,910
He just try to do it whenever the
creative whim,

827
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:55,851
whim,
you know,

828
00:32:55,851 --> 00:32:56,860
just kind of do it,
you know,

829
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:00,500
it'll be like focused periods of time.
Like I'm at this week is going to be

830
00:33:00,501 --> 00:33:03,470
dedicated to any,
and same thing with training.

831
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,350
If I'm at a train or if I'm at,
I'd be doing Jujitsu,

832
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:11,210
I'm going to do any of that stuff.
I will hire somebody to be there because

833
00:33:11,211 --> 00:33:12,620
now I have to do it.
Right.

834
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,820
So if I have friends that were,
you know,

835
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,710
musician friends,
they flown out,

836
00:33:15,711 --> 00:33:17,840
we're going to write this week,
okay,

837
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,720
I'm in my truck,
I'm over here and want to come in and

838
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,960
we're going to track some stuff that
didn't work back to the truck.

839
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,450
Why Arizona?
That's where I live.

840
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,630
Just always lived there.
I moved there in [inaudible] 95.

841
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,080
Really?
Why 95 I hate La.

842
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:35,840
Hate your town.
Let's not mine,

843
00:33:35,841 --> 00:33:38,330
but I don't like it either.
And tried to escape,

844
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,400
moved here and basically December of 89,
so,

845
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,180
you know,
basically 1,990 January.

846
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:45,890
And uh,
it just,

847
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:48,080
it only took a little bit of time.
I mean,

848
00:33:48,081 --> 00:33:49,340
I got,
don't get me wrong,

849
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:51,130
I got a lot out of this town.
Things,

850
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,210
you know,
odd things happen for me.

851
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:56,930
Um,
you're just kind of set the ball in

852
00:33:56,931 --> 00:33:57,764
motion.
I mean there's,

853
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,390
you know,
I was doing a lot of things,

854
00:33:59,391 --> 00:34:01,530
we'll buy life before I moved to La.
Um,

855
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,010
and there's a lot of achievements and
things that I'd,

856
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,900
that I'd kind of done for myself.
And,

857
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,930
uh,
but then it wasn't until I was actually

858
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:12,770
in la in a band where somebody who's
profiting on my decision making that you

859
00:34:12,771 --> 00:34:13,610
actually heard about me.

860
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,750
So,
you know,

861
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:16,700
there's a lot of things that I was kind
of doing before I got here.

862
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:20,660
And then I fell into the band thing and
that kind of got popular.

863
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:21,494
And,
uh,

864
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,500
that was my actually stuck here for as
long as I did.

865
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,840
Cause I just within like a couple of
years,

866
00:34:26,841 --> 00:34:28,400
I was like,
this is not for me.

867
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,900
I don't,
I need to be in a small town.

868
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,290
When it got to a certain point,
have the fame of tool,

869
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:36,320
you could pretty much have done whatever
you want to anyway because you're mostly

870
00:34:36,321 --> 00:34:38,540
just touring and you just had to be
around the people when you were

871
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:39,740
rehearsing and preparing.
Right.

872
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,873
Kind of.
Yeah.

873
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,500
I think a little bit more hands on than
that,

874
00:34:42,501 --> 00:34:43,334
but,
uh,

875
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:44,690
you know,
for the most part,

876
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,440
uh,
that was,

877
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,400
that was the case.
But,

878
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:49,700
you know,
and then been been from 95 to 2000.

879
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,700
I kind of bounced back and forth a
little bit from Arizona to here just

880
00:34:52,701 --> 00:34:53,990
because of the work.
You know,

881
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:55,670
you have to,
when you're recording and doing stuff,

882
00:34:55,671 --> 00:34:57,940
he had to kind of be there for Nda.
Right.

883
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:02,660
You're on the road for pretty much.
And that in those days it was easily six

884
00:35:02,661 --> 00:35:04,100
months out of the year,
a year traveling.

885
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,650
But of course,
you're younger than you can handle it.

886
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,470
Now.
The area you're out,

887
00:35:09,471 --> 00:35:11,720
it's like,
that's like a haunted wild west town,

888
00:35:11,721 --> 00:35:12,650
right?
It's an old,

889
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,720
it's an old copper mining town.
Uh,

890
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:19,220
it's like a billion dollar copper mine.
It had this huge or body underneath this

891
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:23,420
side of this hill,
$1 billion worth of copper.

892
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,550
And that was like,
you know,

893
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,110
1920s,
1930s billions.

894
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,420
So it was like,
it was a huge or body,

895
00:35:29,421 --> 00:35:32,570
like big enough to put a cathedral in
the hole in the ground that they took

896
00:35:32,571 --> 00:35:33,404
all the copper up.

897
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,430
And did you pick this area because it
just seemed like an area or you don't

898
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,840
really like the vibe of it?
No,

899
00:35:39,841 --> 00:35:41,040
I am at,
I had a dream.

900
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,810
I was supposed to be out of fucking la.
He got it.

901
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,650
Yeah.
And I just kept having this recurring

902
00:35:46,651 --> 00:35:48,120
dream and it's like a,
you know,

903
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:52,410
it was a very specific images and place.
And uh,

904
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,240
I think,
you know,

905
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,630
for some reason I thought it was Arizona
and a,

906
00:35:57,631 --> 00:35:59,940
I remember talking to Hicks about it and
I go on,

907
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:01,770
I think,
I think it was supposed to be in

908
00:36:01,771 --> 00:36:03,610
Arizona.
And uh,

909
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:06,580
I mentioned that to Tim Alexander and
you know,

910
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:07,710
I said,
I've been to Phoenix,

911
00:36:07,711 --> 00:36:08,970
I'm not,
I'm not having it.

912
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,270
Um,
and I described the dream and Tim went,

913
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,070
oh,
I know what that is.

914
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,130
See Cause he's from,
he's from Arizona.

915
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:18,420
And so he went,
okay,

916
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,760
I have to take you some place.

917
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,370
We drove up there and like rolling into
that valley just going,

918
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,920
Holy Shit,
this is the place.

919
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,990
Wow.
And then I got up to the town,

920
00:36:27,991 --> 00:36:30,330
it's like,
no shit.

921
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:34,320
Do you interact with the town's folks?
Because to me that's the hardest thing

922
00:36:34,321 --> 00:36:35,730
about moving to anywhere.
It's,

923
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,500
you've got to find cool people,
you know,

924
00:36:37,501 --> 00:36:40,670
in the,
I am the absolute troublemaker in that

925
00:36:40,671 --> 00:36:41,790
time.
It comes in,

926
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,540
you know,
they,

927
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,373
you know,
it's uh,

928
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,120
it was an old mining town.
It kind of,

929
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,620
they kind of turned,
a lot of that went away.

930
00:36:47,621 --> 00:36:49,630
It's like 20,000 people in this town at
one point.

931
00:36:49,631 --> 00:36:52,260
And we'd have working the mind like,
and then the Clarkdale area and to

932
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,780
Cottonwood area and draw Mary work in
his mind,

933
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:55,840
you know,
when,

934
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,120
uh,
want to dry it up and you know,

935
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,510
there was the depression and the World
War One and doing all that kind of

936
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:00,930
stuff.

937
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:02,790
It kind of shut down.
It dropped down to like,

938
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:05,280
you know,
30 people in this small town.

939
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,780
Whoa.
And then of course,

940
00:37:06,781 --> 00:37:08,020
you know,
the 70,

941
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,831
60,
70,

942
00:37:08,831 --> 00:37:12,450
so the draft Dodgers and the people that
just wanted to do what they wanted to

943
00:37:12,451 --> 00:37:13,700
do,
uh,

944
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,810
moved into this basically in abandoned
town.

945
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,150
You,
anyone new Bisbee no.

946
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,610
Uh,
I'm sure we're Bisbee is,

947
00:37:20,611 --> 00:37:21,940
but it's not,
I think it's more on the,

948
00:37:21,941 --> 00:37:24,090
on the edge of the state and somewhere
it's very weird,

949
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,280
but a very similar,
very similar scenario.

950
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,680
So you know,
the trust fund babies and the hippies

951
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:31,490
moved in,
kind of took over the town and uh,

952
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,060
there for them,
you know,

953
00:37:33,061 --> 00:37:36,510
for the most part,
the people that moved into the town are

954
00:37:36,511 --> 00:37:39,060
not the kind of people that built the
town,

955
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:40,860
not the kind of visionary as it came in
and went,

956
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:44,070
I think there's copper under this thing
and then did all this stuff.

957
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,250
I'm more like those people.
And so I'm kind of the enemy because I

958
00:37:47,251 --> 00:37:49,020
do stuff,
you know,

959
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,480
heaven forbid.
Um,

960
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,300
so how you a trouble maker and the town
though,

961
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,280
anyone,
they don't,

962
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,380
you know,
they fear change.

963
00:37:55,381 --> 00:37:58,680
And you know,
we came here to retire and then not do

964
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,590
anything.
Well you make too much noise or too

965
00:38:01,591 --> 00:38:04,170
strange.
I just stuff I'm just doing stuff,

966
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:05,610
bringing by,
you know,

967
00:38:05,611 --> 00:38:09,060
by discovering the terroir there and
making wine there.

968
00:38:09,061 --> 00:38:12,060
I'm bringing people to town.
You're what you're bringing people on.

969
00:38:12,061 --> 00:38:14,730
We went on to new people in town.
So you're telling how they going to pay

970
00:38:14,731 --> 00:38:18,720
for your pipes in your electric and how
are going to make your streets be safe.

971
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:21,090
It's a municipality,
not a camping ground.

972
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,440
You need,
he need funding.

973
00:38:24,441 --> 00:38:26,330
You need tax dollars to fix your thing.
And you know,

974
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,910
the best way to really fix your town is
if you have something that's unique to

975
00:38:29,911 --> 00:38:32,580
your town and export,
if you will.

976
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,740
I found it.
How dare I?

977
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:38,140
So you're doing well for the town and
they just don't like anything moving or

978
00:38:38,141 --> 00:38:40,060
anyone to make them feel.
There's a handful of people that are

979
00:38:40,061 --> 00:38:42,100
like the hand.
There's a handful of people that are

980
00:38:42,101 --> 00:38:43,290
basically,
they're their mos.

981
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,460
You just lay in the street and if you
can move them,

982
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:47,230
okay,
then you can kind of go down the street.

983
00:38:47,231 --> 00:38:48,610
But if you can't move them and you give
up,

984
00:38:48,611 --> 00:38:52,330
they win and you just kind of sail tail
between your legs and you leave.

985
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:55,030
I don't,
I don't know how to move stuff.

986
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:59,410
That's my problem with La is that La is
where my friends are and if I had to

987
00:38:59,411 --> 00:39:02,260
move to another place,
I'd have to deal with a bunch of fucking

988
00:39:02,261 --> 00:39:04,900
people and all their nonsense,
you know,

989
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,410
unless you bring everybody with you,
which is also going to start a

990
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,263
complicated.

991
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,870
Yeah,
get all Kuresh on it.

992
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:13,050
Do you have friends out in Jerome?
Yeah,

993
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:15,010
absolutely.
Did you have them already?

994
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,230
You know,
Amy,

995
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,590
I made a lot of friends,
just some really,

996
00:39:17,591 --> 00:39:20,140
really awesome artists in that town,
like really good people.

997
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,790
And they all mean well that,
don't get me wrong,

998
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:24,130
all of every single person in the talent
means well,

999
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,650
and they're all good people.
But you know,

1000
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:29,470
that's just personalities and small town
politics,

1001
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:35,320
but still better than the insane buzz of
this hive this fall.

1002
00:39:35,321 --> 00:39:36,490
Yeah,
30 million.

1003
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:39,940
Hi.
I much prefer the conflict that we have

1004
00:39:39,941 --> 00:39:42,310
with our,
with our people and in Jerome over

1005
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,190
whatever the hell it was.
It went over there on the five and the

1006
00:39:45,191 --> 00:39:47,500
third one 34 today.
Hey,

1007
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:49,540
we just decided to shut this ramp down.
Well,

1008
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:53,170
have you ever flown in to lax and you
see the four oh five and you see

1009
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,820
literally seven eight nine 10 miles of
stopped cars and you crawl into your

1010
00:39:57,821 --> 00:40:00,850
overhead Bin and hope that they just let
you go back to Tokyo is like,

1011
00:40:00,851 --> 00:40:02,260
what the fuck is that?

1012
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,970
This is craziness.
This is just,

1013
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:08,230
we're just banking on nothing going
wrong ever in a place where the earth

1014
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:09,520
moves.
Yeah.

1015
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:12,190
Yet here I am like an idiot.
I'm trying to get out.

1016
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,450
I'm,
I'm working on right now.

1017
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:16,030
I'm working on my next move any minute
now.

1018
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,550
I tried Colorado for a little bit.
It's a long story,

1019
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:21,160
but my dog got eaten by a mountain lion.
I came back.

1020
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,230
Yeah.
Colorado is a weird,

1021
00:40:23,231 --> 00:40:26,350
when like you go to Denver and there's
that area where almost everybody's

1022
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:29,610
missing an eye and arm or in a
wheelchair or a walker.

1023
00:40:29,611 --> 00:40:30,444
That's like a weird,
like,

1024
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,820
like a twin peaks.
But like on steroids area and you kind

1025
00:40:33,821 --> 00:40:35,260
of go,
we have,

1026
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:37,630
we'd have contests like okay,
we're here for 24 hours,

1027
00:40:37,631 --> 00:40:40,030
whoever can count the most wheelchairs
and,

1028
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,730
and you know,
three points for a wheelchair.

1029
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:46,450
One point for like a missing arm and be
people coming back to like,

1030
00:40:46,451 --> 00:40:47,590
you know,
the soundcheck going,

1031
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,600
I got 40 points.
Really?

1032
00:40:49,601 --> 00:40:53,890
What area of Denver is this?
It's right on that 16th street promenade

1033
00:40:53,891 --> 00:40:56,680
area right there in no sin in the center
of town there.

1034
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,580
It's insane.
It's,

1035
00:40:58,830 --> 00:40:59,401
you're,
you're,

1036
00:40:59,401 --> 00:41:01,720
you're there for,
if you're there for longer than 12

1037
00:41:01,721 --> 00:41:02,554
hours,
start going,

1038
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:03,880
what's going on?

1039
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,870
Is there like a,
you know,

1040
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,820
they,
they testing out these things.

1041
00:41:09,821 --> 00:41:11,350
Are they,
are these people actually in them?

1042
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,900
I've never noticed.
I picked Denver because it's got a

1043
00:41:13,901 --> 00:41:16,720
strong medical marijuana community.
And then so once you get used to,

1044
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:20,890
the way they have it set up in La is you
can't deal with the nonsense of dealing

1045
00:41:20,891 --> 00:41:23,260
with drug dealers.
It's just become so stupid.

1046
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,390
But Denver set up pretty much exactly
like Ella is Denver in boulder.

1047
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,030
There's places everywhere.
They have a,

1048
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,780
I think they call it broad stir.
Damn.

1049
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:34,160
When they have one area where it's

1050
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,210
a,
I think it's Broadway,

1051
00:41:35,211 --> 00:41:36,170
there was this like,
you know,

1052
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,110
bakery shops and you know,
the whole deal.

1053
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:42,410
It's got a good,
they have to like a sensible liberal

1054
00:41:42,411 --> 00:41:43,340
vibe.
You know,

1055
00:41:43,341 --> 00:41:45,800
Denver in a Boulder's a little bit more
radical,

1056
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:48,920
but Denver has a sensible openminded
vibe.

1057
00:41:48,921 --> 00:41:52,790
Like they support guns and they support
hunting and they support outdoors

1058
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:55,430
activities,
but they're also in favor of gay

1059
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:58,200
marriage and they're also in favor of
not discriminating.

1060
00:41:58,201 --> 00:41:58,821
And you know,
so it's,

1061
00:41:58,821 --> 00:42:00,800
it's a very interesting,
that's why I picked it,

1062
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:03,020
but Arizona always scared me,
man.

1063
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,330
It's,
it's definitely a scary place when,

1064
00:42:05,331 --> 00:42:05,850
in terms of

1065
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,800
all those things you just mentioned.
But I think it's,

1066
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:11,370
I think all that stuff's kinda changing
there because you can't have something

1067
00:42:11,371 --> 00:42:16,260
that's so far one way and not have a
pushback and have and have and have a

1068
00:42:16,261 --> 00:42:18,600
community that's just the complete polar
opposite.

1069
00:42:18,601 --> 00:42:22,440
And it's absolutely there.
So eventually it'll just kind of come

1070
00:42:22,441 --> 00:42:23,274
around.

1071
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,160
The,
the idea of living in cities,

1072
00:42:25,161 --> 00:42:28,490
I think it's one day not going to be
necessary anymore.

1073
00:42:28,491 --> 00:42:31,910
I think we needed it because everybody
had to be on top everybody.

1074
00:42:31,911 --> 00:42:33,290
Cause that's where you worked and you
know,

1075
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:35,690
in order to communicate with everybody.
But now because of the Internet,

1076
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,920
I think,
uh,

1077
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:39,410
there's a lot of people's jobs that
don't have to be in,

1078
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:40,550
in the swarm.

1079
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,620
Yeah.
I mean there's a lot of,

1080
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:45,330
there's definitely a lot of just change
in general happening with the,

1081
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:46,960
just the way we think about stuff.
And,

1082
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,610
um,
I don't know about you,

1083
00:42:48,611 --> 00:42:52,930
but I've had like a had a week there
about two months ago or it's just,

1084
00:42:52,931 --> 00:42:57,670
everything just seemed like the
gyroscopes were off and I couldn't,

1085
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,970
I couldn't get anything right.
It was like I'd forgotten how to do the

1086
00:43:00,971 --> 00:43:02,490
most simple things,
you know,

1087
00:43:02,491 --> 00:43:03,610
like,
you know,

1088
00:43:03,611 --> 00:43:04,750
not,
not the perfect example.

1089
00:43:04,751 --> 00:43:09,751
I got to walk outside to change a tire
and I've got like a carrot and a candle.

1090
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:10,620
Like,
okay,

1091
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,453
well

1092
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,090
one lane,
there was a cycle,

1093
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,710
like a vibe or I think,
I think it's,

1094
00:43:14,711 --> 00:43:16,210
I still kind of feel a little bit,
yeah.

1095
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:16,990
But I was like,
I was,

1096
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:19,000
I kind of called a friend who,
uh,

1097
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:21,070
she's,
you know,

1098
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,450
she's as crazy as I am.
It really,

1099
00:43:22,451 --> 00:43:23,310
she's like,
uh,

1100
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,120
she does a complete Kundalini Yoga.
You,

1101
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:29,770
unless she wakes up at 4:00 AM to watch
the sunrise and do the breath of fire.

1102
00:43:29,771 --> 00:43:31,300
And so she's,
you know,

1103
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,730
how the,
she's a complete Kook and I'm an,

1104
00:43:33,731 --> 00:43:35,920
I drank the Koolaid or,
or we're onto something here.

1105
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:37,173
But,
uh,

1106
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,133
you know,
she,

1107
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:41,250
she said just being a funny,
you should ask that because that's kind

1108
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:43,930
of what we're,
what she's seeing in her world,

1109
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,660
how everything's done,
you know,

1110
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:48,100
the gyroscopes or just kind of off and
uh,

1111
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,610
and the biggest,
I think the biggest thing she was

1112
00:43:51,611 --> 00:43:53,760
suggesting and has kind of done some
reading on it as well,

1113
00:43:53,761 --> 00:43:56,950
is like,
it's just more a matter of paying

1114
00:43:56,951 --> 00:44:01,390
attention.
I'm not letting it get to you,

1115
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:03,700
uh,
not being like all,

1116
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,010
you know,
Tony Robbins and get all,

1117
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:06,400
you know,
positive greeny guy,

1118
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:07,540
but,
uh,

1119
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:09,340
you know,
just like know that it's all gonna work

1120
00:44:09,341 --> 00:44:12,550
out and don't let the petty shit get you
down.

1121
00:44:12,551 --> 00:44:16,000
Don't let the,
the dark stuff sink in because it's

1122
00:44:16,001 --> 00:44:19,480
almost like you're in a record groove,
you're in the light groove,

1123
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,930
and if you let,
if you've flop over to the dark groove,

1124
00:44:22,931 --> 00:44:26,170
you kind of get stuck in that groove and
it's kind of a downward spiral.

1125
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:29,950
So one thing that I've found it's most
difficult to deal with when you deal

1126
00:44:29,951 --> 00:44:34,080
with a large city or a large as you are,
you're constantly getting other people's

1127
00:44:34,081 --> 00:44:37,440
energy in there.
It's sometimes hard to dictate your own

1128
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:39,780
path.
And that's what she was saying

1129
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:43,680
because I think in a way you have to
kind of just not hang out on a fear.

1130
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:48,990
Just kind of settle in calmly and just
like we're talking about what the

1131
00:44:48,991 --> 00:44:49,810
Jujitsu,
the guy,

1132
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:51,540
he's big and he's strong and he's got
technique,

1133
00:44:51,541 --> 00:44:55,920
but you just had to take a deep breath
and some level know that one way or

1134
00:44:55,921 --> 00:44:59,550
another it's all gonna work out as
Kundalini Yoga people are fascinating.

1135
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,110
A buddy of mine has a friend that does
the same thing

1136
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:05,300
every morning.
She does the breath of fire and she

1137
00:45:05,301 --> 00:45:08,570
claims to achieve psychedelic states.
She says that,

1138
00:45:08,571 --> 00:45:10,250
uh,
because of all her years of practice,

1139
00:45:10,251 --> 00:45:12,260
she,
it's just like as if she's taking heavy

1140
00:45:12,261 --> 00:45:14,750
drugs,
she goes to other worlds and

1141
00:45:14,751 --> 00:45:18,080
communicates with entities and you know,
and has,

1142
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:20,450
what she describes is indescribable
experiences.

1143
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:22,850
She said,
if I told you what I could do just with

1144
00:45:22,851 --> 00:45:25,670
my own breath exercises and couldn't
Daleney Yoga,

1145
00:45:25,671 --> 00:45:26,504
you wouldn't believe me.

1146
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,440
Right.
And you know,

1147
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,430
most of my friends that are in into that
stuff,

1148
00:45:29,431 --> 00:45:31,350
into that deep,
they don't talk about it just because

1149
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:34,890
it's such an individual experience.
And uh,

1150
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,320
and I had another friend who I'm going
to similar,

1151
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,070
a similar path and you know,
she kind of grew up in the,

1152
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,720
in the 60 was everybody's doing,
you know,

1153
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,960
doing acid and stuff.
And uh,

1154
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,890
she had mentioned that,
you know,

1155
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,600
it was Kinda,
it was cool for the,

1156
00:45:48,601 --> 00:45:52,530
the jumpstart for people to kind of get
into that consciousness and be thinking

1157
00:45:52,531 --> 00:45:54,570
on that level.
But at the same time,

1158
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:56,790
they didn't really do the work to get
there.

1159
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,520
So they really didn't understand what it
was they were experiencing.

1160
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:02,520
So when away she called it spiritual
theft,

1161
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,230
but you got like,
and all of a sudden you're just right in

1162
00:46:04,231 --> 00:46:06,060
the middle of this thing,
but you don't really have any business

1163
00:46:06,061 --> 00:46:06,860
being there.

1164
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,730
Right.
You can't really process what it is that

1165
00:46:08,731 --> 00:46:11,370
you're experiencing.
Recreational mushroom trips.

1166
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:12,241
Yeah.
And so,

1167
00:46:12,241 --> 00:46:13,260
yeah,
it's so you're like,

1168
00:46:13,261 --> 00:46:14,280
here you are.
And then,

1169
00:46:14,281 --> 00:46:15,510
you know,
for most people that just,

1170
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:19,920
that's lights out for them.
They're going to be a little mark the

1171
00:46:19,921 --> 00:46:22,620
rest of their lives.
But I kind of agree with that.

1172
00:46:22,621 --> 00:46:25,950
I think that some of the work taking
that time and really taking your time,

1173
00:46:25,951 --> 00:46:29,880
getting to those states are in just in
your life in general and doing anything.

1174
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,950
Um,
but it's,

1175
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:35,880
it's really difficult for most people
these days because they want what they

1176
00:46:35,881 --> 00:46:39,150
want when they want it because they're
so used to getting whatever the fuck it

1177
00:46:39,151 --> 00:46:41,550
is they want when they want it to.
They don't get it.

1178
00:46:41,551 --> 00:46:43,590
They lose their shit.
Yeah.

1179
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:46,550
Which is exactly opposite of the
psychedelic experience.

1180
00:46:46,551 --> 00:46:48,020
What it would teach you.
I think,

1181
00:46:48,021 --> 00:46:48,731
um,
the,

1182
00:46:48,731 --> 00:46:52,190
the approach is so important and doing
the work and saying,

1183
00:46:52,191 --> 00:46:55,500
doing the work is so important because
you're treating whatever this experience

1184
00:46:55,501 --> 00:46:57,500
is,
is going to be with a,

1185
00:46:57,501 --> 00:47:01,430
a deep amount of respect.
And unless you do that,

1186
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,110
you know,
I don't think you're,

1187
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,910
you're really going to get the most out
of it.

1188
00:47:04,911 --> 00:47:07,610
I mean,
if you just go into it and try to just,

1189
00:47:07,611 --> 00:47:11,000
uh,
let it cure you or let it figure you out

1190
00:47:11,001 --> 00:47:13,010
or let it,
you're just going to be too blown away

1191
00:47:13,011 --> 00:47:15,680
with the whole thing to really absorb
any of it.

1192
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:17,690
Right.
You're doing the work.

1193
00:47:17,691 --> 00:47:19,880
And like,
one of the things that I really

1194
00:47:19,881 --> 00:47:23,780
appreciated about the people that really
get into Kundalini Yoga is they all seem

1195
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,900
legit.
I haven't met anybody who claims the

1196
00:47:26,901 --> 00:47:30,400
psychedelic states who,
who doesn't really like a humble person.

1197
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:34,330
It really seemed like there,
there's never any weird ego shit or you

1198
00:47:34,331 --> 00:47:34,970
know,
weird,

1199
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:36,720
a trace of bullshit.
It's,

1200
00:47:36,721 --> 00:47:39,850
it seems like this,
this is just what they do.

1201
00:47:39,851 --> 00:47:41,350
And they'll tell,
talk to you about it and they'll

1202
00:47:41,351 --> 00:47:43,660
describe it to you.
But they say it's not about the,

1203
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,670
it's not about the psychedelic state of
it.

1204
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,030
It's all about just like a sort of a,
a,

1205
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:51,640
it's about knowing that it's going to go
in knowing that it's all gonna work out.

1206
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,530
Yeah.
You know,

1207
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:56,850
and we might not even be included in
this form that we're in and how it's

1208
00:47:56,851 --> 00:47:59,190
gonna work out.
And if you can let go of the fear of

1209
00:47:59,191 --> 00:48:01,140
worrying about whether that's going to
happen or not.

1210
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,510
As soon as you can just let go of that
fear and just,

1211
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:04,980
you know,

1212
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:07,470
let go.
Just appreciate what is,

1213
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:10,290
appreciate what it is.
Don't worry about what Ken,

1214
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:13,800
what would,
what may appreciate what is and know

1215
00:48:13,801 --> 00:48:17,790
that even if it doesn't work out,
it's going to work out cause it's all

1216
00:48:17,791 --> 00:48:20,520
works out even if it doesn't work out.
Exactly.

1217
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:24,540
It's too hard for us to wrap our heads
around how big the whole picture is.

1218
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:25,800
You know,
when you realize that,

1219
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:27,440
you know,
what is the,

1220
00:48:27,441 --> 00:48:29,430
um,
the,

1221
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,530
the Woodstock song,
we are stardust.

1222
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:34,020
We are golden.
We are billion year old carbon.

1223
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:36,530
Well we're,
we really are fucking Joni Mitchell.

1224
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,070
Yeah.
Joni Mitchell,

1225
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:41,660
who was the Crosby stills they covered
is what it was.

1226
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:42,570
That's her song.
Yeah.

1227
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,820
Brilliant Song.
And it's so true.

1228
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,620
This is the thing that people don't
understand.

1229
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:49,710
Human beings actually made because the
star Burns out,

1230
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:52,320
explodes.
And it has to happen.

1231
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:55,410
If it doesn't happen,
you don't make those materials and human

1232
00:48:55,411 --> 00:48:57,000
life,
carbon based life forms don't,

1233
00:48:57,001 --> 00:48:57,601
don't,
don't exist.

1234
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,940
So even if it doesn't work out,
it works out right.

1235
00:48:59,941 --> 00:49:00,421
It doesn't,
you know,

1236
00:49:00,421 --> 00:49:03,060
you can understand in are in the state
that we're in and you know,

1237
00:49:03,061 --> 00:49:03,540
this

1238
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,790
real tactical,
tactical,

1239
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:07,900
tactical,
uh,

1240
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,090
existence that we live,
you know,

1241
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,530
you get caught up with the game,
you know,

1242
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:12,020
you kind of get into the fear.
Yeah.

1243
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:12,920
Uh,
and uh,

1244
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,760
that's part of it.
Super easy.

1245
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:15,900
So it's okay.
You know,

1246
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:17,880
but every now and he'd get kind of
wrapped up in it.

1247
00:49:17,881 --> 00:49:18,714
And,
uh,

1248
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:20,420
I remember like last week,
uh,

1249
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:22,920
the same guide to do Jitsu guy that I
was telling you about,

1250
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:24,480
Todd,
he,

1251
00:49:24,481 --> 00:49:25,680
uh,
he's,

1252
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,080
he just out of the blue texted me like,
so man,

1253
00:49:28,081 --> 00:49:29,250
how's it going?
Like,

1254
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:30,810
it's almost like intuition.
Like,

1255
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:32,310
how's it going?
Like,

1256
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:35,280
funny you should ask,
it's been a shit storm the whole week.

1257
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:36,390
And he goes,
Oh,

1258
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,610
well let me just give you this.
And he sent me this,

1259
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,300
I hope I brought it,
you send this thing.

1260
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:45,780
I ended up forwarding it to a bunch of
people because I knew a bunch of other

1261
00:49:45,781 --> 00:49:49,080
people were going through some weird
shit and uh,

1262
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:54,710
may I sure polluted
so live your life that the fear of death

1263
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:57,030
can never enter your heart trouble.

1264
00:49:57,030 --> 00:50:00,390
No one about their religion,
respect others in their view and demand

1265
00:50:00,391 --> 00:50:02,700
that they respect yours.
I love your life.

1266
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:06,150
Perfect your life,
beautify all things in your life.

1267
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:09,990
Seek to make your life long and its
purpose in the service of your people.

1268
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:13,920
Prepare a noble death song for the day.
When you go over to the great divide,

1269
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:19,080
always give a word or a sign of salute
when meeting up or passing a friend,

1270
00:50:19,081 --> 00:50:24,081
even a stranger when an a lonely place.
Show respect to all people and grovel to

1271
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:27,090
none when you arrived in the morning and
give thanks for the food,

1272
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,010
for the joy of

1273
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,800
living.
If you see no reason for giving thanks.

1274
00:50:30,801 --> 00:50:33,710
The fault lies only in yourself.
Uh,

1275
00:50:33,711 --> 00:50:36,260
abused.
No one and no thing for abuse turns the

1276
00:50:36,261 --> 00:50:38,870
wise ones into fools.
And Rob's a spirit of its division.

1277
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:43,940
When it comes your time to die being out
like those whose hearts are filled with

1278
00:50:43,941 --> 00:50:46,940
fear and death so that their time comes,
they weep,

1279
00:50:46,941 --> 00:50:49,450
they pray for more,
a little time and live their lives again

1280
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,900
over and over in a different way.
Instead sing near death song and die

1281
00:50:53,901 --> 00:50:57,140
like a hero going home.
That's fucking beautiful.

1282
00:50:57,510 --> 00:51:00,090
Like,
so of course all my friends are like,

1283
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:03,490
you know who wrote that?
So I had to go back to him and go,

1284
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:05,210
where'd you get that?
He goes,

1285
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:06,980
uh,
homeless do gave it to me.

1286
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,160
Wow.
It's Jesus.

1287
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:11,750
It's like,
please don't say it's l,

1288
00:51:11,751 --> 00:51:16,670
Ron Hubbard.
I would be my luck like Adolf Hitler.

1289
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:20,140
Well it sounds like I,
I actually,

1290
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:22,660
it's uh,
I actually found it online and it's

1291
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,410
uh,
chief Tecumseh crouching tiger from the,

1292
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,700
uh,
from the shiny nation.

1293
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:30,770
Whoa.
He died in 18,

1294
00:51:30,771 --> 00:51:32,750
13.
Wow.

1295
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:36,360
Wow.
That makes it even

1296
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:38,270
more cool.
Cause I thought it was some new age

1297
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:41,030
douchebag,
probably pilfered some stuff off the

1298
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:43,000
internet and pieced it together.
No,

1299
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:44,080
that's perfect.
Yeah,

1300
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:47,030
I agree with everything you said.
Except for Megan.

1301
00:51:47,031 --> 00:51:47,864
Front of religion.

1302
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:51,461
You go,
girl.

1303
00:51:51,461 --> 00:51:54,920
Other than that it's got me,
I think religion has to be made fun of

1304
00:51:54,921 --> 00:51:55,040
it

1305
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,670
because
if you can't make fun of things that are

1306
00:51:58,671 --> 00:52:00,500
ridiculous,
you're missing out on a big part of

1307
00:52:00,501 --> 00:52:02,800
what's fun about this life and
religions.

1308
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:04,880
Ridiculous respect it,
but made fun of it,

1309
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:05,920
right?
Yeah.

1310
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:07,130
Yeah.
Other than that,

1311
00:52:07,131 --> 00:52:12,131
I'm down town with the Shawnee warriors.
He had thought that was great that he,

1312
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,960
you know,
he says some homeless dude while we

1313
00:52:14,961 --> 00:52:18,110
lost,
we lost such a massive chunk of what

1314
00:52:18,111 --> 00:52:22,910
those people had learned about living
this life of nomadic life,

1315
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:26,180
of following animals and you know,
following,

1316
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:31,160
following herds of buffalo around and,
and learning about the connection

1317
00:52:31,161 --> 00:52:31,761
between,
I mean,

1318
00:52:31,761 --> 00:52:32,930
you gotta think about the,
the,

1319
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:37,430
the deep respect native Americans had
for the animals that they killed.

1320
00:52:37,431 --> 00:52:38,860
And you know,
it's,

1321
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:41,960
it's such a,
an interesting way of life.

1322
00:52:41,961 --> 00:52:45,050
They,
they kept up for so long while most of

1323
00:52:45,051 --> 00:52:47,630
the Western world had already moved on
to,

1324
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:52,040
you know,
riding horses and Kingdoms and houses

1325
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:56,180
and agriculture and these people were
just traveling around and living off the

1326
00:52:56,181 --> 00:52:58,850
land.
It says so much wisdom we could have

1327
00:52:58,851 --> 00:53:00,620
learned from those people and it was
wiped out.

1328
00:53:00,621 --> 00:53:01,454
It's a,
it's,

1329
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:03,470
it's a weird time too when you think
about that.

1330
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:05,300
Just that was just a couple of hundred
years ago,

1331
00:53:05,301 --> 00:53:08,900
a blip in human civilization and there
was these nomadic people,

1332
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:10,460
you know,
living in this area.

1333
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:16,030
I remember watching a,
I went to movies with my son is a few

1334
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:19,280
years ago and it was that a black
stallion movie.

1335
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:20,610
It's,
you know,

1336
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:21,730
some animation.
I mean,

1337
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:24,830
and it was pretty,
I'm just kind of sitting in the theater,

1338
00:53:24,831 --> 00:53:25,664
just kind of,

1339
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:27,780
it kind of dawned on me and I'm kind of
like,

1340
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:30,390
I'm like the,
the curmudgeon with his son.

1341
00:53:30,391 --> 00:53:30,841
Like,
you know,

1342
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:33,360
my kid just going,
can you just enjoy the movie please?

1343
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:36,600
But I'm looking at it going,
this whole movie is based on this

1344
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:41,630
exhilarating feeling of like this black
horse and this guy kind of stopping the

1345
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:43,530
white man for moving west.
And it's like,

1346
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,410
but I'm watching the fucking movie in
Los

1347
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:52,320
and my son's just like,
will you let it go and just enjoy this

1348
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:54,480
movie and get me more popcorn?
Please.

1349
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,500
Yeah.
It's like you rude against us.

1350
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,260
I mean,
that's what Avatar is.

1351
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:02,180
Yeah.
I mean,

1352
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:06,380
avatars don't think they're coming back.
Yeah.

1353
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:10,890
That was the first shit.
UNOBTAINIUM billions of dollars,

1354
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:15,000
I think obtaining them ever coming back.
I mean,

1355
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,470
that was the Santa Maria,
right?

1356
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:20,010
Our ship.
That was the beginning of the first wave

1357
00:54:20,011 --> 00:54:24,510
of the fuckers
until I tried the other stuff.

1358
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:25,373
What do you,
what is your,

1359
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:27,210
this is the,
this is the Shinola.

1360
00:54:27,211 --> 00:54:30,870
I'm really a red wine guy.
I love that.

1361
00:54:30,871 --> 00:54:32,160
Rosa.
It's delicious.

1362
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:34,580
This is a,
this is a special

1363
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:35,590
drop.
Um,

1364
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:38,200
we had,
we got hit with Frost really hard and,

1365
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,420
uh,
early 2011,

1366
00:54:40,421 --> 00:54:44,020
so we didn't have a lot of Arizona fruit
in our vineyards to work with.

1367
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:46,120
So I panicked and I,
uh,

1368
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,313
is this one yours here?
We,

1369
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:50,740
yeah.
And I sourced some fruit from right over

1370
00:54:50,741 --> 00:54:52,900
the border from our,
our vineyards right down on the,

1371
00:54:52,901 --> 00:54:53,890
on the border,
uh,

1372
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:56,830
on the 10 as you're heading toward New
Mexico,

1373
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:59,880
it's in Wilcox in that area.
So right over that border,

1374
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:02,130
like another hour or so,
just pass.

1375
00:55:02,131 --> 00:55:06,130
Wilcox is a New Mexico vineyard and this
guy's out there,

1376
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:09,190
great grower.
He's got all these fantastic Italian

1377
00:55:09,191 --> 00:55:11,520
varietals growing there and there.
You know,

1378
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,450
there's a historic,
it's a pretty old vineyard there.

1379
00:55:13,451 --> 00:55:16,140
So I picked these all these grapes up
for,

1380
00:55:16,141 --> 00:55:17,080
uh,
not much.

1381
00:55:17,081 --> 00:55:18,500
And uh,
did this blend.

1382
00:55:18,501 --> 00:55:20,750
It's Sangiovese.
They'd dual Choate over phospho and

1383
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:23,140
premed Tivo.
So it's a straight up the Italian blend.

1384
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,590
It's delicious from New Mexico grapes.
And it's,

1385
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,180
what do you call it?
Shinola.

1386
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,460
Come on.
Cause that your own name.

1387
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:32,391
Yeah.
Oh No.

1388
00:55:32,391 --> 00:55:32,681
What?
I mean,

1389
00:55:32,681 --> 00:55:33,514
you know,
it's the,

1390
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:35,550
is that a type of wine?
It's actual type of wine.

1391
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,550
It's a,
it's a reference to the jerk.

1392
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,430
The shit from Shinola.
Yep.

1393
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:40,880
Okay.
Yeah.

1394
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:42,410
Wow.
Recognize?

1395
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:44,330
Um,
yeah,

1396
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:47,270
New Mexico is a,
a fascinating area.

1397
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:48,501
You know,
I think,

1398
00:55:48,501 --> 00:55:49,311
uh,
that's where it,

1399
00:55:49,311 --> 00:55:54,311
val Kilmer went and grew his head.
That's where I was watching magical

1400
00:55:54,321 --> 00:55:56,150
space.
I was watching the ghost and the

1401
00:55:56,151 --> 00:55:59,840
darkness the other day and I was like,
there's a funny fucking Internet meme

1402
00:55:59,841 --> 00:56:01,970
where it's Val Kilmer at is most
bloated.

1403
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,800
And it says,
remember when I was Batman,

1404
00:56:03,801 --> 00:56:08,801
lol,
Val Kilmer moved to to,

1405
00:56:09,571 --> 00:56:12,380
uh,
New Mexico and just bought a ranch and

1406
00:56:12,381 --> 00:56:15,260
just grew his head.
I don't know what the fuck happened,

1407
00:56:15,261 --> 00:56:17,210
but in this ghost and the darkness,
I'm like,

1408
00:56:17,211 --> 00:56:19,010
Jesus Christ.
I was a handsome man.

1409
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:22,640
It was stunning.
And we just decided,

1410
00:56:22,641 --> 00:56:23,180
you know what,
I'm,

1411
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:24,280
I like pills better.

1412
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:27,610
I'm just new.
Moved to New Mexico,

1413
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,680
that movie a couple years ago with,
uh,

1414
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:31,420
uh,
Robert Downey Jr.

1415
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:33,780
Yeah.
Well it was that crazy movie.

1416
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,280
He's struck a little.
Yeah,

1417
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:36,810
he's trying,
he's got it under control.

1418
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:37,591
Yeah.
Yeah.

1419
00:56:37,591 --> 00:56:39,110
It seems like you realize,
fuck,

1420
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,410
am I doing,
I kinda liked it.

1421
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,000
Yeah.
It was a fun movie.

1422
00:56:42,001 --> 00:56:43,880
I don't remember what it was though.
What the hell was it called?

1423
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:47,280
Some sort of a,
and involve letters.

1424
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:49,540
Yeah.
And range and in a certain order and I

1425
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:51,240
can't remember any of them.
Yeah.

1426
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:54,230
They all get blurry after a while.
Um,

1427
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:59,270
you became buddies with one of my
biggest influences in one of my biggest

1428
00:56:59,371 --> 00:57:01,590
idols is Hicks.
How did you,

1429
00:57:01,591 --> 00:57:02,490
uh,
how'd you meet him?

1430
00:57:02,491 --> 00:57:02,810
How did that

1431
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:03,910
go down?
Uh,

1432
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:05,060
well,
you know,

1433
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:06,291
as a,
as,

1434
00:57:06,291 --> 00:57:07,430
as you do,
you kind of just,

1435
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:09,770
somebody can hand you a cassette back in
the day.

1436
00:57:09,771 --> 00:57:10,970
It's,
it's a cassette.

1437
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:13,940
It's a,
it's a tape recording and it goes around

1438
00:57:13,941 --> 00:57:15,800
and around,
um,

1439
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,230
uh,
you know,

1440
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:19,170
right around the same time as a eight
tracks,

1441
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,160
but he got the cassette of one is to
first,

1442
00:57:22,161 --> 00:57:24,710
uh,
releases and uh,

1443
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,620
on the,
on the road just like absorbing all this

1444
00:57:27,621 --> 00:57:29,780
stuff.
And an eventually we,

1445
00:57:29,781 --> 00:57:31,250
uh,
when we put out another record,

1446
00:57:31,251 --> 00:57:33,290
we basically thanked him on it and,
uh,

1447
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:37,040
send them a copy of the record and he
reached out and then we just kind of hit

1448
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:39,980
it off and we hit on all these plans.
This was back,

1449
00:57:39,981 --> 00:57:40,814
you know,
earlier,

1450
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,530
earlier tool days.
So,

1451
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:43,761
um,
you know,

1452
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:46,640
we had all these plans that we wanted to
kind of do something with him.

1453
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:47,720
And,
uh,

1454
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:48,780
we were,
you know,

1455
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:51,070
we were still kind of a young bands.
This is like 93,

1456
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,240
94 and,
uh,

1457
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:55,880
we were going to do a tour together and
uh,

1458
00:57:56,030 --> 00:57:59,230
then he got sick.
That kind of allow,

1459
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:00,860
you know,
plans right out the window,

1460
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:01,970
kind of suck at.
Right.

1461
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,620
Right.
When the time was,

1462
00:58:03,621 --> 00:58:05,240
we were small enough to where we could
still,

1463
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:07,700
we could actually do a comedy tour,
you know,

1464
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:10,400
with a comedian and a rock band.
Uh,

1465
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:11,630
as soon as it was,
you know,

1466
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:14,420
a year later there was,
things kind of blew up a little bit and

1467
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:16,050
it would have been,
yeah.

1468
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,120
I mean,
for example,

1469
00:58:17,121 --> 00:58:22,121
we played several shows in the
California area where a tenacious d

1470
00:58:23,031 --> 00:58:26,030
opened for us,
but we were big enough band where people

1471
00:58:26,031 --> 00:58:26,864
in the honors,
she's like,

1472
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:29,850
get this shit off the stage.
I like throwing shit at them.

1473
00:58:29,851 --> 00:58:33,020
When we had the,
we've had like David Cross and Greg

1474
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:34,780
Behrendt do stuff in front of our,
uh,

1475
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:38,090
a show to open the thing and just
getting pelted with stuff now,

1476
00:58:38,091 --> 00:58:39,560
you know,
that wouldn't happen now because they

1477
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:40,550
know who they are,
but

1478
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:44,490
it was still happening.
Yeah.

1479
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:46,030
I know.
People are brutal,

1480
00:58:46,031 --> 00:58:47,260
man.
Yeah.
