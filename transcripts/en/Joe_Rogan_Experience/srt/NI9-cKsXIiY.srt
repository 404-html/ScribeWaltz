1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,670
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,470
That's the one thing comics left to do.

3
00:00:03,471 --> 00:00:05,080
We love being children dot.

4
00:00:05,081 --> 00:00:07,190
Barron's Tom viruses like that,

5
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,163
king of that shit.

6
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,650
I was talking to him last night about you.

7
00:00:09,651 --> 00:00:12,200
He loves you to death and he's like,

8
00:00:12,201 --> 00:00:12,831
you should bring it up.

9
00:00:12,831 --> 00:00:13,880
But how he used to,

10
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,530
he used to go on the road
with you or did you dawn?

11
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,140
I would put don in whatever I was in,

12
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,040
I would put him in,

13
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:21,761
like,

14
00:00:21,761 --> 00:00:23,230
we wound up doing this,

15
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:27,160
this crazy frank Stallone movie in Ixtapa,

16
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:28,410
you know,

17
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:28,660
uh,

18
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,480
Mexico and we were stuck
there for like five weeks.

19
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,680
And of course I made,

20
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,430
I made dawn do like Alfred
Hitchcock and the movie,

21
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,010
there was no call for Alfred Hitchcock,

22
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:40,780
but I talked to producers into it,

23
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,220
you know,

24
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,560
and that's where he actually hurt,

25
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,590
hurt his foot.

26
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,020
You know how he's got like a bad foot.

27
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:47,500
Yeah,

28
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,190
he hurt his foot.

29
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:48,401
Well,

30
00:00:48,401 --> 00:00:49,810
what happened with don?

31
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:51,430
He always wants to fight me,

32
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,151
you know,

33
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:52,984
so,

34
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,090
so one day,

35
00:00:55,091 --> 00:00:55,481
you know,

36
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:59,860
he starts in with me on the set and
it's all these Mexican crew members that

37
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:01,390
don't even understand English.

38
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,180
And he puts his foot like there was a
hole in the ground and he wouldn't cut at

39
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:08,020
a hospital after to fix it,

40
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:08,921
you know?

41
00:01:08,921 --> 00:01:10,120
So to this day,

42
00:01:10,121 --> 00:01:13,030
like he just moves the
wrong way and he's crippled,

43
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:13,691
you know,

44
00:01:13,691 --> 00:01:15,010
he just falls down and,

45
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,240
and it was funny,

46
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,660
what happened was I went back to a
Madison Square Garden in 2000 and it was

47
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:27,160
Don's job at the time to come there
because he really wants to see it with my

48
00:01:27,161 --> 00:01:28,390
wife and my sons.

49
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:34,140
So he was the problem on the plane because
what happened was he's walking down

50
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:37,310
an aisle and the foot goes and he,

51
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:37,841
you know,

52
00:01:37,841 --> 00:01:38,770
Don's emotional,

53
00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:39,340
you know,

54
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,690
so he's screaming,

55
00:01:40,691 --> 00:01:44,130
laying on the floor and Blaine scaring,

56
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,950
scaring the entire flight,

57
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:47,941
you know,

58
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,880
and then they get them into a
chair and the foot felt better.

59
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:51,930
You know,

60
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,920
that the cops were at the
airport to question him and I go,

61
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,410
you a job was to just bring them.

62
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:58,711
He had,

63
00:01:58,711 --> 00:01:59,670
that was the gift.

64
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:02,760
You get to fly for nothing
and get a hotel room,

65
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,690
bring them in and you cause a
problem on the fucking airline.

66
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,100
But that's done.

67
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,550
You know,

68
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,340
that's who he is.

69
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,320
Do you think he was his
practical joking with,

70
00:02:11,321 --> 00:02:11,741
you know,

71
00:02:11,741 --> 00:02:12,574
he was

72
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,710
laying at norms.

73
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,201
No Nigga,

74
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,034
I'm going,

75
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,190
it really goes,

76
00:02:18,191 --> 00:02:19,860
his foot really goes,

77
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,180
is it a broken foot?

78
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:22,014
Is it a ligament?

79
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,490
I'm sure he'd like chips,

80
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:26,400
something in his ankle and he
just wouldn't go to the house.

81
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:26,731
He goes,

82
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:27,840
well they're going to do to me,

83
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:28,081
you know,

84
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,700
he turns into this baby,

85
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,193
you know?

86
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:31,711
Oh yeah.

87
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:33,060
And he would do the road with me,

88
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:33,451
you know,

89
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:36,300
and I had it when he
would do the road with,

90
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,490
I would just take them with
me when he would do the road.

91
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,323
I had a,

92
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,850
at that time I had Eddie Griffin with me.

93
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:42,751
I had,

94
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:43,110
yeah.

95
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,070
So Eddie Griffin was like the real open,

96
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,080
you know.

97
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,490
And so what would happen is I
give don 10 minutes right upfront.

98
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,790
So we'd be on a big tour bus,

99
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:57,750
traveling the country and one time
he's on the bus and he's like,

100
00:02:57,751 --> 00:02:59,530
you know how he gets down on himself,

101
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,191
you know,

102
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:01,750
like almost like that,

103
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:03,550
that he's not crying with tears.

104
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:05,530
But I'm going well down.

105
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,130
It's because the crowd doesn't
respond the way he wants.

106
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:09,910
You know,

107
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,290
cause he would come out singing,

108
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,330
tie a yellow ribbon,

109
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,603
you know,

110
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,513
you know with the,

111
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,790
with the music over it and
get the crowd clapping.

112
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:22,110
And so now the song ends and
then he goes into another one.

113
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:23,740
I'll go into like Copa Cabana.

114
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,640
So now he's on the bus
complaining about that.

115
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,160
Go Don,

116
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,750
it's you a 10 minutes after they get
the joke of who you are that you're this

117
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:33,130
fucking goofball.

118
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,080
Well now we are the jokes,

119
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,041
you know.

120
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:36,910
And he would go,

121
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:37,151
well,

122
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:37,481
you know,

123
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:38,350
I went into the other,

124
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:38,801
so I go,

125
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,880
they don't want to hear another,

126
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:41,260
you already did the bit,

127
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,550
you had them clap.

128
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:45,040
Now they've got to clap
to Barry Manilow singing,

129
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:45,590
you know,

130
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,540
Copa Cabana,

131
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:47,710
who gives a fuck,

132
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,391
you know what I mean?

133
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:50,680
And nobody gives a fuck.

134
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,330
You create the character,

135
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:55,750
you just fucking big goofball
and now give him jokes,

136
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:56,681
you know?

137
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:57,190
And,

138
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,520
but we had a lot of fun and then there
would be another rumble on the bus.

139
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,570
Now it's him jumping on me and
trying to kill me on the bus.

140
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:04,961
Yeah.

141
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:05,290
He's,

142
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,600
his life is constant
theater with that guy.

143
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,010
Did I?

144
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:14,010
That's who I hang out with every single
day from midnight to about 4:00 AM Tom

145
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:14,980
Barrett.

146
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,640
That's fun.

147
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,181
And you know,

148
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:19,150
it was hysterical with the
movie we did in Ixtapa,

149
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,170
uh,

150
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:20,590
they,

151
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,500
they want them to stay and
film for longer than I,

152
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,760
I want them to be there,

153
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,661
you know,

154
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:26,140
and I'm going,

155
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,950
I gotta get Outta here.

156
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,180
I got gigs I got to do.

157
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:30,100
So they promised me a lot of,

158
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,993
a lot of money,

159
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:31,840
you know,

160
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,420
in like cash and in Taiwan,

161
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:35,711
you know,

162
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,940
through the whole shoot is going,

163
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,230
they're never giving it to you.

164
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,580
You've got to get it now.

165
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:39,891
I go,

166
00:04:39,891 --> 00:04:40,230
Don,

167
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,110
they're going to pay me.

168
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:41,950
We made a deal.

169
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,813
That's it.

170
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,540
You know,

171
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,020
Eh,

172
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,441
you know,

173
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:45,880
and you know,

174
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,450
the,

175
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,160
it was a crazy set,

176
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:48,551
you know,

177
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:48,851
I mean,

178
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:51,340
I never went through anything
like this in a film ever.

179
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,031
You know,

180
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:53,950
what went on in those five weeks.

181
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,530
And so he's gone,

182
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:55,840
you know,

183
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,740
two to five weeks.

184
00:04:56,741 --> 00:04:58,330
I've got to hear how
they're not going to pay me.

185
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:58,601
You know,

186
00:04:58,601 --> 00:04:59,890
he's just on me that the,

187
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,280
and of course they give me the
money and dawn had a tape it up,

188
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,241
you know,

189
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:05,260
all over my body.

190
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:07,180
Like that movie midnight express.

191
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,013
Did you really?

192
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,261
Yeah,

193
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:09,160
because you know,

194
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:14,161
it was a part of Mexico that we actually
thought that the director was going to

195
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:14,520
happen.

196
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,910
He stopped at the airport,

197
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:16,961
you know,

198
00:05:16,961 --> 00:05:19,030
so you know with thinking,

199
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:19,331
all right,

200
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:19,810
how am I gay?

201
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,190
Cause she not allowed more than like
$10,000 in cash and it was a lot of money,

202
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:24,941
you know,

203
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:29,941
so he was taping it with this like
paper tape to my chest to my thought.

204
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,890
You know that when I got home and
when we're going through the airport,

205
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,280
I'm gone,

206
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,210
they're going to stop me,

207
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,540
I'm going to be in jail and whoever
stops and he's going to be rich,

208
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,231
you know,

209
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:42,160
it's that simple.

210
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,480
But they didn't stop us.

211
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:48,481
And now I get home and I take off my shirt
and my wife sees all this money taped

212
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:50,350
to my chest and she's going,

213
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,760
what is that?

214
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:52,991
You know,

215
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:53,531
and I'm going,

216
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:53,741
no,

217
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:54,640
they paid me.

218
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,533
You know,

219
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,040
that's how they pay you in Mexico.

220
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,550
But Dom was just so sure.

221
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:02,820
Then I pay me for them.

222
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,220
It was just crazy.

223
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:04,940
It was,

224
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,773
I wouldn't eat,

225
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,410
we only had one meal a day because
everybody on the set was getting sick.

226
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,101
You know,

227
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:11,980
everybody was going to
the hospital and it,

228
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,460
and all we had every day was um,

229
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,450
we went to the same restaurant
about four o'clock every day.

230
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:20,360
We had pasta with sauce,

231
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,500
garlic bread and Coca
Cola with purified ice.

232
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,230
And we would eat til the
next day at the same time.

233
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,470
Cause we figured we'd make it the middle
of the day because we're only getting

234
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:31,191
that one meal.

235
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:33,020
We're not eating any of the food there.

236
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:33,740
Wow.

237
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:33,981
Yeah.

238
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:35,990
And he lost like 30 pounds.

239
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:36,940
Fine.

240
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,600
He's,

241
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,150
he's gone.

242
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,200
I got to eat something,

243
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:40,780
you know,

244
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,613
he's going,

245
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,730
this is ridiculous.

246
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,060
We're not eating food,

247
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:44,860
you know,

248
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,820
but everybody's fallen at the waist side.

249
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:47,511
What are we going to do?

250
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:48,140
We got no choice.

251
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,130
This is survival,

252
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:49,701
my friend.

253
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:53,120
Would those be movie sets
can be very fucking sketchy.

254
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,800
And it was for a long time,

255
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,430
was hit five weeks of the same food.

256
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,800
But I'm a cringe Mexico.

257
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,950
I could do that.

258
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,560
I could eat the same
thing every single day,

259
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,660
but you want it like twice a day.

260
00:07:05,661 --> 00:07:06,411
But the restaurant,

261
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:07,910
we're close like nine at night,

262
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,780
so we'd have to wait till the next day
at four o'clock to have the next meal.

263
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:12,770
Wow.

264
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,660
So it was bottled water,

265
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:15,411
you know,

266
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:16,244
and that was it.

267
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,680
Bottled water and pasta once a day.

268
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,490
What's the name of it
was called the good life.

269
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,280
It never came out.

270
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,113
Ah.

271
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:23,451
You know,

272
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:25,010
and I always talked to frank Stallone.

273
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:28,040
He always says he should release
like pieces of it on the Internet.

274
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,893
Yeah.

275
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,890
It was the craziest thing,

276
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,470
you know?

277
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,303
Uh,

278
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,190
I wanted it to be a comedy.

279
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:36,290
Frank Stallone wanted it to be a drama,

280
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,020
you know,

281
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,730
because,

282
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,400
because,

283
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:39,850
you know,

284
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,000
I would tell the producers,

285
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:41,361
I go,

286
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:41,690
you know,

287
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,310
it's really a funny movie,

288
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,000
you know,

289
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,410
and comedy cells.

290
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,780
So when frank would do a scene,

291
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,330
he'd come over to the director and go,

292
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,140
you know,

293
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,771
how was that?

294
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:52,400
And he goes,

295
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:52,790
well,

296
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,320
it was very dramatic,

297
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,633
you know,

298
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,300
and he's gone,

299
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:56,451
well,

300
00:07:56,451 --> 00:07:57,590
it's supposed to be a drama.

301
00:07:57,591 --> 00:07:58,011
And he goes,

302
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:58,461
well,

303
00:07:58,461 --> 00:07:59,780
I think it should be funnier.

304
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:00,780
And he goes,

305
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,050
put the movies a fucking drama.

306
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:03,711
Like,

307
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:04,930
so he was flipping out it.

308
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,440
We had a big fight over that movie.

309
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,303
But uh,

310
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,310
but the producers now wanted
to just be like a comedy.

311
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,450
Dennis Hopper's in it.

312
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,710
It was supposed to be,

313
00:08:12,711 --> 00:08:13,640
you know what it was supposed to be.

314
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,670
It was supposed to be
Goodfellas on a golf course.

315
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,990
So Dennis Hopper,

316
00:08:17,991 --> 00:08:18,441
you,

317
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:19,540
Dennis Hopper was in it,

318
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,750
but it was filming.

319
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:21,584
Really.

320
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,970
Can you find it anywhere?

321
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:24,920
It's snow would be,

322
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:25,820
but it doesn't.

323
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:26,011
Yeah.

324
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:26,844
It's not online,

325
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,040
but no one put it online.

326
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,560
But David Carradine was in it too.

327
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,190
Yeah.

328
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,430
A lot of people were in is
really the Angelos alone,

329
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:34,850
isn't it?

330
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:35,630
Yes.

331
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,530
That's hilarious.

332
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:37,400
He didn't never made it.

333
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,430
You should never know shit to
Netflix or something like that.

334
00:08:40,431 --> 00:08:40,890
You make,

335
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:41,510
it's,

336
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:41,691
well,

337
00:08:41,691 --> 00:08:42,890
it's not my movie to sell,

338
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:44,120
but you know,

339
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,930
it just wound up the whole
time in Ixtapa was drama,

340
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:48,810
you know?

341
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,140
But the movie's hysterical.

342
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,063
You know,

343
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,990
it was just movie sets.

344
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,220
I've only been on one.

345
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:55,770
I've been on,

346
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,920
well to be movie.

347
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,080
But you know what happened?

348
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:03,110
We had a good director at the beginning
and then the producer who was an

349
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:08,301
attorney fired the director and
he'd decided to direct a no.

350
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,500
So now what happens is,

351
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:12,480
this is where it starts
going a little crazy.

352
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,310
Uh,

353
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:13,771
and I,

354
00:09:13,771 --> 00:09:14,041
you know,

355
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:14,910
I can't play golf.

356
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:16,050
I hate fucking golf.

357
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,870
I don't have patience to
hit a one little ball,

358
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:19,201
you know,

359
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:20,370
of course the pork,

360
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:21,204
whatever,

361
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,223
you know.

362
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,600
So I wasn't really good
at playing the golf,

363
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:24,871
you know,

364
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:26,730
so we would make it that
they make fun of me.

365
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:29,610
But I had some like golf
material at the time.

366
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,080
We had talked about hating golf.

367
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,670
So the,

368
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,504
the,

369
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,550
this new director makes me do some of
that material on like the master shot,

370
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,540
like on a crane.

371
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:40,711
So he goes,

372
00:09:40,711 --> 00:09:42,840
I want you to do that
monologue every time,

373
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:43,951
you know?

374
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:44,550
And I go,

375
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:44,701
no,

376
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:47,390
but I'm not doing that monologue
every time I did a few,

377
00:09:47,391 --> 00:09:52,020
cause you asked me to do it in the mass
to shut just so he gets them talking and

378
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:52,530
he goes,

379
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:52,741
no,

380
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:53,360
I want you to do it.

381
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:53,581
I go,

382
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:55,140
that's my material from my act.

383
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:55,980
I don't want to do it.

384
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,260
You know you're not
paying me for it all year.

385
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,520
And he goes,

386
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,510
you'll do what I say.

387
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:02,250
I know I'm not going
to do a fucking thing.

388
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:03,084
You say,

389
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,670
I go and don't ever tell
me what to do again.

390
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,440
Ever in front of the camera.

391
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:12,180
Which Dom Barris is falling down laughing
as he's making a little documentary

392
00:10:12,181 --> 00:10:13,320
movie with my camera,

393
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,600
because I was always filming.

394
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:14,941
He did.

395
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:15,751
He literally say,

396
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:16,740
you'll do as I say,

397
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,161
yeah,

398
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:18,000
whoever lands.

399
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:18,900
And he goes and he,

400
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:19,560
and he says,

401
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,341
if you don't like it,

402
00:10:20,341 --> 00:10:21,174
you could leave.

403
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:21,900
So I said,

404
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,231
okay,

405
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:22,681
I'll leave.

406
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:23,281
I go done.

407
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:23,761
Let's go.

408
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:24,660
And I had clipped soda,

409
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:24,961
Kenny,

410
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:25,141
they,

411
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:25,411
I go,

412
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:26,070
let's say.

413
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:26,491
He goes,

414
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:26,671
well,

415
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:27,850
my attorneys will be in touch.

416
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:28,290
I go,

417
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,130
asshole,

418
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,090
you told me to leave to say it.

419
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,220
You don't want me in the movie,

420
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:35,310
if I don't want to do my own
material and I don't want to do it,

421
00:10:35,311 --> 00:10:38,880
so don't fucking tell me what to
do and I'll stay and that's it.

422
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:39,930
You know?

423
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,120
And what don loved is,

424
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,800
no matter what the guy did,

425
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:44,101
you know,

426
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,330
for his main profession,

427
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:46,164
he goes,

428
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,750
you're telling you director,

429
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,850
the guy that's supposed
to tell you what to do,

430
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,220
don't ever tell me what to do again,

431
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:57,300
but that's his only job right
now is telling you what to do.

432
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:57,841
I go,

433
00:10:57,841 --> 00:10:58,021
yeah,

434
00:10:58,021 --> 00:10:58,851
but you heard what?

435
00:10:58,851 --> 00:10:59,880
When went down,

436
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:00,121
you know,

437
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:01,140
and he agreed with it.

438
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,350
And then I decided to
direct part of the special,

439
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,330
it's not the special the movie.

440
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:07,620
And um,

441
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,830
cause I come to the set one
day and it's like 110 degrees.

442
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,090
And this guy,

443
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:12,361
you know,

444
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:14,040
the guy directing was,

445
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:14,371
you know,

446
00:11:14,371 --> 00:11:15,630
he had a funny character.

447
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:20,630
He was very low keyed with a sombrero
cause it was Mexico and it was always hot.

448
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,291
And I go,

449
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:22,650
uh,

450
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,730
what are we doing today?

451
00:11:23,731 --> 00:11:24,564
And he goes,

452
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,400
I don't know.

453
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:27,390
You know,

454
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,223
and I go,

455
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,090
do you want me to set the shot up?

456
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,500
And he goes,

457
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,400
what'd you please?

458
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,530
This is the director now.

459
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:35,580
He goes,

460
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,413
just tapped out.

461
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:36,960
He goes,

462
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,450
I just want to finish
the movie and go home.

463
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,890
And that's how he would talk.

464
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:42,330
That's like an impression of the guy.

465
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,490
So now I'm directing,

466
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,350
I'm directing the movie.

467
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,390
And that was a scene I directed.

468
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:53,160
This was great because I was like a little
at wool with frank stuff at the time

469
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,003
on the set.

470
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,500
So I was shooting a scene that I needed
dawn Barris for and now I decided to

471
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:00,071
club soda.

472
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:01,480
Kenny will be in the movie also,

473
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:02,830
you know.

474
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:07,830
So frank is shooting a scene where he's
like playing a guitar in his underwear,

475
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,010
talking to some girl he was
with in bed the night before.

476
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,280
So I come in there and
I take the sound guys,

477
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:15,950
I'm like,

478
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:16,783
come on,

479
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,830
just come with me.

480
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,350
So now I get the sound guy.

481
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:24,130
So he winds up shooting this whole scene
that he's doing and he doesn't know,

482
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:25,300
he doesn't have sound.

483
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,790
And all of a sudden
coming from this house,

484
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,140
you hear him screaming,

485
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,720
he talked the fucking sound,

486
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:32,554
guys,

487
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,790
you made me do all these takes and
we don't even have fucking sound.

488
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,310
And then the director's going,

489
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:39,551
well,

490
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,800
diocese directing a scene right now,

491
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,120
you know?

492
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,571
And he goes,

493
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:46,300
why the fuck is he directing anything?

494
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,430
It's not his movie to direct.

495
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:48,941
I mean,

496
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:49,660
people were having,

497
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,640
and then we crashed the golf carts,

498
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,230
which I got in trouble for.

499
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,150
I play chicken with the,

500
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:55,400
you know,

501
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,111
Peter Dobson,

502
00:12:56,111 --> 00:12:56,830
he's an actor.

503
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,500
No.

504
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,060
Um,

505
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,980
he's been in a lot of stuff anyway,

506
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:01,870
so it's an Ian Dobson.

507
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:05,050
We're good friends and decide to
play chicken with the golf carts.

508
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,680
And I turn it the last second and my
golf cart gets completely destroyed.

509
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:14,170
And frank goes flying out of
it because he's with me going,

510
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:15,240
what are you doing as what?

511
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,610
Going towards each other and I'm
going to just stick with me on this.

512
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:18,851
He goes,

513
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:19,990
I don't want to stick with you.

514
00:13:19,991 --> 00:13:21,100
Stopped driving,

515
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:21,761
you know,

516
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:23,320
but we wouldn't stop driving.

517
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:24,770
And I turned and they smash him.

518
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:25,190
I,

519
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,160
so now I'm not allowed to.

520
00:13:26,161 --> 00:13:27,640
You play golf cart chicken.

521
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:27,881
Yeah.

522
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:29,590
Chicken to see who turns first,

523
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,030
you know,

524
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,820
and then we're having sword
fights with the golf clubs.

525
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:34,091
I mean,

526
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:35,080
it was ridiculous.

527
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,100
What was going on.

528
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:36,691
You know,

529
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,860
Beverly Deangelo's in the movie,

530
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:39,510
uh,

531
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,940
Frank Pash is in the move towards
your war with a frank Stallone.

532
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,370
What was it?

533
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:46,000
Just that I believe the
movie should be a comedy,

534
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:46,810
you know?

535
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:51,750
So I started doing like an
impression of him on screen goes,

536
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,870
I could do him really well
the way he stands and Oh,

537
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,181
you know,

538
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:57,100
so now he sees the final cut and he goes,

539
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,260
what are you doing behind me?

540
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,610
You know,

541
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,020
I go an impression of you.

542
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:02,891
He goes,

543
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:04,930
you're not supposed to be
doing an impression of me.

544
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,221
I'm,

545
00:14:05,221 --> 00:14:07,660
I'm the leader of the gang I got,

546
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:08,530
but it's funny.

547
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:10,420
And he goes to put the movie's not funny,

548
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,291
you know?

549
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,250
And of course we all made up after them,

550
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:13,870
you know,

551
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,440
movie,

552
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,070
you know,

553
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:15,940
never came out,

554
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:17,200
you know,

555
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,080
make up with everybody.

556
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:18,840
Make up with Paul.

557
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
You may not put that guy.

558
00:14:19,841 --> 00:14:20,081
Yeah.

559
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:20,741
Because it's,

560
00:14:20,741 --> 00:14:22,210
it's more fun to have your friends.

561
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,620
Are you going to make them laugh about it?

562
00:14:23,621 --> 00:14:23,670
Yeah.
