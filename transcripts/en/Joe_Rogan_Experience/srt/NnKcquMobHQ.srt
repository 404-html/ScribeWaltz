1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,640
All Right Ladies and gentlemen,
we are here and I'm here with Jocko 

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,611
willink of extreme ownership,
how us navy seals lead and win.

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,670
I'm really excited to read this because 
I really enjoyed your podcast with Tim 

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:17,850
Ferriss and I've seen you around the UFC
a bunch of times,

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,060
but uh,
I didn't know much about you,

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,760
but you're one of those dudes,
you know where I look at this guy.

7
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:25,920
I'm like,
that guy probably knows some shit.

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,810
This is,
this says something about you,

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,250
like when I see you,
you know,

10
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:34,251
you're hanging around with lister.
I saw you a few times at the UFC in 

11
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:37,400
line.
Like I probably know some shit or he's 

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,130
seen some shit and then I saw or 
listened to the Tim Ferriss podcast.

13
00:00:38,131 --> 00:00:38,510
I go,
oh,

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,380
okay,
well that makes a lot of sense.

15
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:45,381
Now if you haven't heard that podcast,
it is excellent and you're the one of 

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,040
the first guy ever to come with your own
notepad in your own pen too.

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,750
I just want to point that out.
Just trying to be prepared.

18
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,850
Well,
that's your whole thing,

19
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:57,240
man.
I'm a big fan of your social media posts

20
00:00:57,241 --> 00:00:58,650
too because,
uh,

21
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,740
I like feeling like a lazy fuck whenever
I look at your social media posts and 

22
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,180
you have a picture of your watch for 45 
in the mornings.

23
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,380
Dudes out there working out.
I like it.

24
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,700
Yeah.
It's interesting because,

25
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:09,340
uh,
you know,

26
00:01:09,341 --> 00:01:14,341
obviously they had zero social media 
presence like three months ago or 

27
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,980
whatever the case may be.
And Tim Ferriss was,

28
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:17,700
you know,
basically said,

29
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:22,701
hey,
you need to get on this social media 

30
00:01:22,701 --> 00:01:22,701
stuff.
And I said,

31
00:01:22,701 --> 00:01:22,800
okay,
can you kind of show me what to do?

32
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:23,430
And he says,
yeah,

33
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:28,431
sign up.
So then I signed up and then he dropped 

34
00:01:28,431 --> 00:01:30,651
that podcast that gets listened to by a 
bunch of people and all of a sudden I 

35
00:01:30,651 --> 00:01:34,590
was engulfed in the social media world 
and I found twitter to be the one that,

36
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:39,591
uh,
was the easiest to use and you don't 

37
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:39,591
have to write a lot.

38
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,540
So,
you know,

39
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:43,470
I don't like people that talk a whole 
bunch without saying anything.

40
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:45,900
So I figured that one's pretty cool.
Yeah,

41
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:50,901
that was the thing that I was thinking 
when he was encouraging you to use 

42
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:54,410
social media was like a guy like you,
you're not a peacock,

43
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,240
you know,
and there's something about social media

44
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,120
as a person who's an avid social media 
user,

45
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,430
there's some peacocking to it,
you know,

46
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:04,830
and I try to do it with humor and I try 
to,

47
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,860
because it's,
it's an important aspect of promoting 

48
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,080
comedy shows and podcasts and things 
along those lines.

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,190
But,
um,

50
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,760
you were much more of a,
keep it to yourself.

51
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,360
One of the things that I loved about the
Ferris podcast you were talking about,

52
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,780
um,
how you would have a commanders would 

53
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,830
come to a various leaders and ask them,
what do you need,

54
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,180
what do you need a and guys would have 
all these requests and all these things.

55
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,400
We need Wifi and we need this.
And you were like,

56
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,350
we're good sir.
We're good sir.

57
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,160
And the idea behind that is when you did
need something,

58
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,070
if you really did need something,
someone would come to you,

59
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,200
you would get it quickly.
Absolutely.

60
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:48,201
When I,
when I needed something and I spoke up 

61
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:48,201
and said,
hey,

62
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,480
hey boss,
this is what I need and this is why I 

63
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,581
need it.
They would instantly give it to me 

64
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:53,190
because they knew that I was telling the
truth that it wasn't some,

65
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,890
you know,
halfassed requests that wasn't real.

66
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:58,410
It was something that we legit needed 
and they'd give it to me.

67
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,190
Well,
this is the value

68
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,250
of someone who keeps their words short 
and means what they say and says what 

69
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,841
they mean and doesn't have a lot of 
bullshit involved in their vocabulary.

70
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:14,881
Or,
and this is coming from a professional 

71
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:14,881
bullshitter.
I mean,

72
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:14,881
this is what I do.
I bullshit.

73
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:15,340
I talk,
you know,

74
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,940
fill a lot of hours of just shooting the
shit about nonsense.

75
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,420
And I mean I have to look in the mirror 
at myself.

76
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:25,390
I mean,
I just wrote with my partner Leif Babin,

77
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:27,130
who I served with,
you know,

78
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:30,510
we just wrote a 300 page book about us,
you know,

79
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,520
for all practical purposes.
Now of course it's about our team and 

80
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:35,520
it's about what we learned,
what we experienced.

81
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,660
But there's no doubt that there's some 
level of,

82
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,680
you know,
self promotion when you're writing a 

83
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:42,680
book that's got your name on the cover 
of it,

84
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,250
and now I'm sitting here talking to you 
and I guess that puts me in the same 

85
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:47,350
league,
maybe not the same league,

86
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:49,120
but at least I'm playing the same sport.
Yeah,

87
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:51,460
we're definitely playing the same sport 
but that.

88
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:57,060
But there's benefit to that because I 
think what you have to say and 

89
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:57,910
especially what you had to say in the 
Tim Ferriss podcast is,

90
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,750
is very important.
It's,

91
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:01,840
um,
it's not just important.

92
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:06,841
It's unique.
And because your perspective is of one 

93
00:04:06,841 --> 00:04:09,960
who was involved in the most intense 
activity,

94
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:13,030
a human being can participate in today's
world.

95
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:18,510
You were involved in combat in Iraq 
during the worst time of the war and you

96
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:24,391
came through it with some pretty intense
lessons and you can.

97
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,960
I think anybody listening to that 
podcast can get a lot out of it.

98
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,980
There's inspiration to be gotten from 
that podcast for sure.

99
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,400
But there's also an understanding that 
can only be.

100
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,150
I don't think anybody else can relay 
what you experienced,

101
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,710
but you,
you know,

102
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:49,711
you can have all these guys that write 
these movies and they could write 

103
00:04:49,711 --> 00:04:52,440
screenplays and television shows about 
it or guys can write books about it.

104
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,900
Embedded journalists can write about it.
It's not the same.

105
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:01,230
It's not the same.
I got a sense from just you talking 

106
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,131
about it on Tim Ferriss' podcast.
Literally a shift in my perspective of 

107
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:07,630
what it's like to be there.

108
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,330
Yeah,
it is.

109
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,790
For me,
it was my,

110
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,940
and I know this might sound weird,
but it was my lifelong dream to be in 

111
00:05:20,851 --> 00:05:23,490
combat and to be in a leadership 
position in combat.

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Ever since I could remember wanting to 
do anything of any substance with my 

113
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:35,031
life,
I wanted to be some kind of a commando 

114
00:05:35,031 --> 00:05:37,350
and so I really felt and the battle of 
Ramadi was,

115
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,970
you know,
like you said it was 2006.

116
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:41,190
There was Ramadi,
Iraq.

117
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:46,191
It was the worst place in the world at 
the time and I knew that and I felt like

118
00:05:47,161 --> 00:05:52,161
my whole life had sort of been preparing
me to be there in that position.

119
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:58,070
Taking care of those guys to the best of
my ability and going out and sending 

120
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:02,741
them out to go and kill the enemy and 
supporting the conventional forces that 

121
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:07,871
were there that were unbelievably brave 
and humble and just miraculously 

122
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:12,890
patriotic and we formed a brotherhood 
that,

123
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,610
you know,
to this day I don't think it'll ever be 

124
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:18,890
replaced and you can see why,
you know,

125
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:23,950
these stories of war stand the test of 
time and when we talk about the 

126
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:29,081
Peloponnesian wars,
we talk about war for all time because 

127
00:06:29,081 --> 00:06:29,510
there's,
there's something there and I think it's

128
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:34,310
what you began with because it is the 
ultimate human test.

129
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,900
You know,
it's the ultimate.

130
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,080
It is other people are trying to kill 
you and you're trying to kill them and 

131
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,031
that's just the ultimate test and not 
that it's a great test or a test that 

132
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:52,301
everyone should want to have happen 
because it's awful and horrible and 

133
00:06:52,301 --> 00:06:56,980
wretched in many ways,
but at the same time it's there and it's

134
00:06:57,021 --> 00:07:01,460
present and there is no avoiding it.
There is no avoiding it.

135
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,070
War is part of the world.
It's part of human nature.

136
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,670
I know Dana White says fighting's in our
DNA,

137
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,560
well you don't have to go,
but one or two degrees further from fist

138
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:17,561
fighting to where you know,
tribes of human beings are trying to 

139
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:18,020
kill each other.
Yeah.

140
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,260
It's one of the subjects that have 
talked about with my friend Duncan.

141
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:23,670
We were,
we were going over this and we,

142
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:28,710
we essentially came to the conclusion 
that the history of the human race is a 

143
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,200
history of military warfare.

144
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:35,550
I mean,
when are you talking about the human 

145
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:35,550
ways race?
You talk about the civil war,

146
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,150
he talk about World War One,
world war two,

147
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,530
Korea,
Vietnam.

148
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,380
You talk about wars and in between those
wars,

149
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,370
people preparing for more war or trying 
to avoid war,

150
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:49,040
the cold war in between wars,
you know,

151
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,890
you talk about the various conflicts 
throughout history,

152
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:54,970
whether it's [inaudible] or whether it's
Napoleon,

153
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:59,990
whether you're talking about war.
I mean almost all of our history has 

154
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,151
been trying to keep people from fucking 
with us and trying to take things that 

155
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:09,641
we think will help our people.
That's essentially the history of the 

156
00:08:09,641 --> 00:08:09,641
human race.
Yeah,

157
00:08:09,641 --> 00:08:14,140
and I think what really strikes people 
and why there's a an almost sick 

158
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:21,100
fascination with it in some ways is 
because there it's,

159
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,120
you know,
we say that a combat is like life but 

160
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,340
amplified and intensified.
So it's similar to regular life except 

161
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:33,110
for the consequences are obviously 
everything you know,

162
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:33,920
you,
you can die,

163
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:38,921
that can be the end of you and so when 
you're in that moment and when you read 

164
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:40,760
about that and when people read these 
books or watch these movies,

165
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,390
they get some sense of what that must be
like.

166
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,160
And I think that's why there's,
like I said,

167
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:51,161
some attraction to it.
I mean that's why there's hundreds and 

168
00:08:51,161 --> 00:08:54,500
hundreds of war movies and hundreds and 
hundreds of war books because people try

169
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,800
and understand what that

170
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,260
emotional content really means.

171
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,820
Well,
there's no higher stakes,

172
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,850
so anytime you're,
you're involved in an activity that 

173
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,600
literally there are no higher stakes 
other than the loss of your loved ones 

174
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,250
and the grief that you would suffer 
because of that.

175
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:11,220
The loss of your own life is about the 
highest state possible.

176
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:16,670
And when I talked to people like you or 
many of the other guys that have talked 

177
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:19,080
to that have served and been involved in
combat,

178
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:24,150
one of the craziest aspects of it is 
many want to be back there.

179
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:29,630
Many experience that life tuned up to 11
and they recall it like it's the best 

180
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:32,400
time of their life.

181
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,300
There's no doubt about it.
Best time of my life,

182
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,580
crazy,
no doubt about it.

183
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,970
Feeling that pressure,
um,

184
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,710
knowing what was at stake.
And again,

185
00:09:42,711 --> 00:09:44,630
for me in a leadership position,
you know,

186
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:47,240
everyone feels a little bit different 
from me in a leadership position.

187
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,540
You're not worried about yourself 
getting hurt or killed.

188
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,510
You're worried about your guys getting 
hurt or killed.

189
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,600
And that's the most important thing.
And the thing that's keeping you awake 

190
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:58,600
at night and the thing that's driving 
you.

191
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,970
And so there's an intensity there,
but having so much pressure and so much 

192
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:15,441
at stake when it goes away,
it's definitely leaves a hollow,

193
00:10:16,751 --> 00:10:20,260
empty space inside.
There's no doubt about it.

194
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,130
Well,
you see it with fighters,

195
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,910
with boxers,
MMA fighters when they retire,

196
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:30,911
they have a real hard time finding 
regular life to be fulfilling and I can 

197
00:10:32,991 --> 00:10:35,990
only imagine it would be way more 
intense because of war,

198
00:10:35,991 --> 00:10:39,890
because the thing about fighting is it's
such a solitary sport.

199
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,830
You know you have your team behind you,
you have coaches,

200
00:10:42,831 --> 00:10:45,710
you have guys that you prepare with that
you train with,

201
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:49,580
but once you're locked up inside that 
cage or you step inside that ring,

202
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,760
it's really all just about you.
The experience is yours.

203
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:58,330
When you're a war,
you're experience is protecting all 

204
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:03,110
those around you as well as staying 
alive and losing friends and thinking 

205
00:11:05,151 --> 00:11:10,151
that you could have done something 
differently and maybe someone would 

206
00:11:10,151 --> 00:11:10,630
still be here.
That's,

207
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,150
that's a completely different kind of 
thing.

208
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:19,510
To leave and to come back to regular 
civilization and then to watch all the 

209
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:23,510
shit that you did in Iraq go to pieces 
now.

210
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,820
You watched just fucking chaos over 
there.

211
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:30,821
Now everyday in the news that the.
Whether it's the civil war between the 

212
00:11:30,921 --> 00:11:35,921
Sunni and the Shia or whether it's 
what's going on with Isis and it just 

213
00:11:35,921 --> 00:11:40,061
seems like whatever gains that you guys 
made there are slowly being eroded 

214
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,630
everyday.
Does that also like pull at you?

215
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,070
Oh yeah.
Yeah,

216
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,700
absolutely.
So we don't,

217
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,750
like I said,
we fought and when I say we,

218
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:54,130
I'm talking about a giant group of five 
or 6,000

219
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:59,131
Americans with the one.
One had just a huge group of awesome 

220
00:11:59,131 --> 00:12:02,251
guys,
soldiers and marines and we were a part 

221
00:12:02,251 --> 00:12:03,310
of them and so they,
they,

222
00:12:03,311 --> 00:12:05,710
we all fought very hard for the city of 
Ramadi.

223
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,390
I mean this is,
it's a city,

224
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,240
it's a city like a city in America.
It's a,

225
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:14,340
you know,
it's got roads and it's got houses and 

226
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:14,340
Scott building and it's got a government
center.

227
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,071
It's got a soccer stadium.
It's a city like what we have in 

228
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,211
America.
And we went in there and fought to take 

229
00:12:21,211 --> 00:12:25,171
the city back from these savages that 
owned it at the time.

230
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,620
And why do I call them savages?
It's because they

231
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,480
tortured people.
They skinned people alive.

232
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,290
They beheaded people.
They raped little girls and little boys.

233
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,440
That was just disgusting and so we went 
in there and fought against them and 

234
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,720
beat them and what we did in doing that 
is the people that actually lived there.

235
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,840
Again,
this is a city with human beings in it 

236
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,030
and I always have to tell this story or 
at least relate to people that you'd be 

237
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,150
running down the street.
There'll be and firing around you,

238
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,160
kick open the door to a compound to 
somebody's house and you'd get in there 

239
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,890
and there'd be,
you know,

240
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
a guy,
a dad working on a car and there'd be 

241
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,390
two kids kicking a soccer ball and 
there'll be a mom cooking lunch.

242
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:19,260
And so there's people there and those 
people wanted us to be there and wanted 

243
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:23,050
us to defeat the insurgents that were 
terrorizing them.

244
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,550
And we did.
And they were joyous about that.

245
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:31,450
And so when you talk about what do I 
think now when I see isis,

246
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,310
the black flag of Isis,
I mean,

247
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:38,311
is there any other more dramatic image?
Then I can tell you then that the black 

248
00:13:38,311 --> 00:13:40,930
flag of Isis now flies at the government
center Amati.

249
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:41,530
It's,
it's,

250
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:46,590
it's horrible and it's sickening.
And they went around and anybody that 

251
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,260
had anything to do with the coalition 
there,

252
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:52,380
they went around with a list of names 
and they murdered all of them and all 

253
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,370
their families and you know,
we,

254
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,440
we as a country,
we kind of left them hanging and it's,

255
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,270
it's horrible to see that

256
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,960
we left them hanging and we instigated a
lot of crazy shit when we took Saddam 

257
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Hussein out of power,
which was probably ultimately a good 

258
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,271
thing to get rid of that guy.
And it was no question that he was a 

259
00:14:20,271 --> 00:14:23,631
psychopath and his sons were evil fucks.
But in creating that vacuum,

260
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,230
like when the leadership has gone,
you,

261
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:32,310
you kind of have a responsibility to 
manage that area.

262
00:14:32,311 --> 00:14:35,190
Now.
As crazy as that sounds like people want

263
00:14:35,191 --> 00:14:36,500
to say,
we're not in the building.

264
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,360
We're not in the business of nation 
building.

265
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,560
We're not,
we're not in the building process or 

266
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:44,560
the,
the,

267
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,601
uh,
the business of organizing or 

268
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:51,030
structuring a nation,
building a democracy out of one,

269
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,160
which did not have

270
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,860
one ever,
but you kind of have to,

271
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,140
we'll look what we did in Germany and 
Japan.

272
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,840
Yeah,
we're still in both those countries.

273
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,660
We stayed there.
And guess what?

274
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:03,100
The two,
you know,

275
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,200
what are the two economic superpowers 
behind America?

276
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:11,470
You know,
I know those two are both in the top 

277
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,631
five.
Germany is definitely the head of 

278
00:15:13,631 --> 00:15:13,631
Europe,
you know,

279
00:15:13,631 --> 00:15:13,631
besides China,
but Japan,

280
00:15:13,631 --> 00:15:16,610
those are economic superpowers.
They're very successful countries and we

281
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:21,611
formulated their new structure.
Now there's a lot of resistance in this 

282
00:15:21,611 --> 00:15:26,081
country.
There always was a lot of resistance to 

283
00:15:26,081 --> 00:15:28,510
going to Iraq in the first place because
people didn't understand the connection 

284
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,740
between nine slash 11 and Iraq and it 
seemed like it was manufactured.

285
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:33,080
It seemed like two people on this side 
that,

286
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,910
you know,
we're looking at it and we're looking at

287
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld and all 
these chicken hawks that wanted us to go

288
00:15:40,581 --> 00:15:41,600
over there and why.

289
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,990
But once you're there,
you kind of have to have a different 

290
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:46,990
approach,
don't.

291
00:15:46,991 --> 00:15:48,650
Yeah.
Well,

292
00:15:48,651 --> 00:15:50,300
there's no doubt.
You have to have a different approach.

293
00:15:50,301 --> 00:15:51,710
You have to believe in what you're 
doing.

294
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,500
And again,
when you're number one and,

295
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:59,530
and every,
every soldier or marine or service 

296
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,350
member will tell you that when they're 
in combat,

297
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,190
they're not thinking about,
you know,

298
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,040
the strategic mission of the United 
States of America.

299
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:09,041
They're thinking about the guy that's 
next to them and what they're going to 

300
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:09,041
do to keep that,
keep their buddies alive.

301
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:09,890
And that's,
that's all there is to.

302
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:11,510
And that's true in anyone will tell you 
that.

303
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:17,260
But that being said,
when you come back from that operation 

304
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:17,260
and you have time to think about what 
you're doing there,

305
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,590
then you've got to believe in what 
you're doing.

306
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,030
And if you don't believe in what you're 
doing,

307
00:16:20,031 --> 00:16:21,350
then you're going to have some serious 
issues.

308
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,150
And so for me,
you know,

309
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,760
it was pretty obvious that what we were 
doing was,

310
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,480
was absolutely the right thing.
I mean,

311
00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:34,481
you've got insurgents there that were 
foreign fighters that want to kill 

312
00:16:34,481 --> 00:16:37,430
everyone in America.
They hate us,

313
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
they want to destroy us,
they want to do nine slash 11 over and 

314
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,381
over again in this country.
They want to kill us all and so for us 

315
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:51,851
to be there fighting them,
I am totally on board and was on board 

316
00:16:51,851 --> 00:16:56,261
and remain that way today.
Now these insurgents that came in to 

317
00:16:56,261 --> 00:17:00,221
these places like Ramadi and we're 
taking over the city and killing all 

318
00:17:00,221 --> 00:17:00,890
these people and torturing all these 
people.

319
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,920
Why were they doing that?
To them it's the same.

320
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,140
It's the same thing that isis did when 
they went back.

321
00:17:06,141 --> 00:17:07,940
I mean they want to have a chunk of 
land.

322
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:08,810
At the time they.

323
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,830
They'd said that Ramadi was going to be 
the seat of their caliphate.

324
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:15,070
It's going to be the capital city of 
their caliphate,

325
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:20,210
that that's what they were trying to do.
So in a sense like once war started over

326
00:17:20,361 --> 00:17:21,620
there,
it became a holy war.

327
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,580
Yes,
and it's a holy war.

328
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,390
But it's interesting because the people 
of Iraq,

329
00:17:29,391 --> 00:17:33,050
there's people in Iraq,
most people in Iraq,

330
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,560
when you talk to them,
they're normal people that want to have 

331
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,280
a job,
you know,

332
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,790
build a new addition on their house,
fixed the roof,

333
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,960
uh,
get some good food for dinner that 

334
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,011
night,
raised their kids so that they can take 

335
00:17:51,011 --> 00:17:51,011
over the family business or that's what 
they want.

336
00:17:51,011 --> 00:17:54,750
They're not a bunch of people running 
around doing what Isis is doing.

337
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,530
But who is the powerful force in Iraq 
right now?

338
00:17:58,531 --> 00:18:00,420
Now everyone's scared of Isis.
And,

339
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,990
and one thing about this is there,
you know,

340
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:08,991
because Iraq is,
they don't have this kind of patriotic 

341
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:13,110
feeling that we have in America,
which I know,

342
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:18,140
I know it may be dying in many cases,
but there's a lot of Americans still 

343
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,580
believe America's the greatest country 
on earth and that.

344
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,410
And even if you don't believe it's 
greatest country on earth,

345
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:24,900
and even if you see it for all its 
faults that it's has.

346
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,320
You appreciate the fact that in this 
country you have freedom.

347
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,580
And so you can kind of fight for that no
matter what you're thinking about,

348
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:33,750
you're,
you're fighting for freedom,

349
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:35,490
you're fighting to protect your family.
Well,

350
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:36,330
in Iraq,
they're like,

351
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,410
okay,
um,

352
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,230
I'll,
I'll fight for whoever,

353
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:45,231
I'll,
I'll fight for whoever or support 

354
00:18:45,231 --> 00:18:45,231
whoever is just gonna allow me to live 
the.

355
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:50,370
They don't have the same attitude.
That's why when Isis came into Ramadi 

356
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:50,880
and the,
the Iraqi troops kind of ran away.

357
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:51,630
They're like,
well,

358
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,720
we don't know what's going to happen.
We don't really don't have that core 

359
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,051
belief that they're fighting for.
And so I think that's where some of the 

360
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:02,250
challenges come in and as they grow that
they will,

361
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,330
they will perform better.

362
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,670
But it's definitely gonna take quite a 
bit of time.

363
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,010
Well,
I think patriotism in America was at its

364
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:10,590
all time high around September 11th.
Right?

365
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:13,650
Right after that happened,
you never saw more flags.

366
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,860
I mean,
I remember driving down the street and 

367
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,350
every car had a flag hanging from it.
No doubt about it.

368
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,600
I mean,
it was a buddy of mine,

369
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,570
Jay London sold flags.
That's what he used to do,

370
00:19:24,571 --> 00:19:26,760
sell car flags,
flags that you put on cars.

371
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:31,970
Man,
I had a good business going on for 

372
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:31,970
awhile,
but like a lot of things,

373
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,840
people got accustomed to it.
They got it settled in and everything 

374
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:40,851
got back down to its normal level,
so so was this big buzz of patriotism 

375
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:46,100
will.
There's a big buzz of patriotism when 

376
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,810
you feel threatened and we never feel 
threatened.

377
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:52,260
In America.
Everyone is driving around in a nice big

378
00:19:52,261 --> 00:19:56,430
suv that gets eight miles to the gallon 
with big air conditioning blasting.

379
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:01,430
They're looking at their iphone,
texting people socially interacting 

380
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,040
through the,
through the Wifi,

381
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,490
and they're not concerned about their 
safety.

382
00:20:05,491 --> 00:20:07,040
And so when you're not concerned about 
your safety,

383
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:12,050
what is there left to be patriotic?
When you don't understand what it means 

384
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:12,050
to live in fear.
So yeah,

385
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:15,270
September 11th comes and you get 
attacked and you feel that fear.

386
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,310
Guess what?
You rally around this,

387
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,240
this thing America that's protected you 
and your family,

388
00:20:21,241 --> 00:20:22,530
but you didn't even think about it 
before,

389
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:24,000
but now you're thinking about it and you
go,

390
00:20:24,001 --> 00:20:29,001
you know what?
I'm going to put a flag up on my up on 

391
00:20:29,001 --> 00:20:31,191
my vehicle.
This vehicle that I drive around in 

392
00:20:31,191 --> 00:20:31,191
complete luxury,
which is what America is like,

393
00:20:31,191 --> 00:20:34,500
America is unbelievably luxurious 
compared to the rest of the world.

394
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:39,540
There's also unquestionable evil 
involved in flying planes into buildings

395
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:44,541
and killing civilians just randomly,
haphazardly suicide bombing essentially 

396
00:20:45,301 --> 00:20:50,301
with a plane right into a building or a 
goal that was so evil that everybody 

397
00:20:50,301 --> 00:20:50,301
just.

398
00:20:50,301 --> 00:20:52,180
There was no.
There's no gray area in that.

399
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,480
It was pretty clear.
It was about as clear as any event ever 

400
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:57,480
in human history.
Agree.

401
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:03,030
Now when you found out,
I mean you already involved in the 

402
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:08,470
military when all this was going on you,
you signed up like long before they like

403
00:21:08,471 --> 00:21:13,471
you.
If there's anybody that I've ever met 

404
00:21:13,471 --> 00:21:13,471
that I've ever heard,
talk about it.

405
00:21:13,471 --> 00:21:14,860
That was.
Doesn't mean this is how you feel.

406
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:16,120
You're born for this.
This is.

407
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,710
This is your,
your,

408
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,450
your goal,
your post in life?

409
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,720
Yes.
What put.

410
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,220
What pulled you into them?
You grew up in New England?

411
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,530
I did what?
Part of Connecticut and Maine.

412
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:30,550
Okay,
so it was just sticks on a dirt road,

413
00:21:30,551 --> 00:21:33,040
you know,
just kind of a general American,

414
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:37,000
general American.
What was it,

415
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:40,420
the true you to it?
Like where did you develop this sense of

416
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:41,200
patriotism?

417
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,550
Well,
I would say prior to the,

418
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,280
the feeling of patriotism,
you know,

419
00:21:48,281 --> 00:21:48,670
I,
I,

420
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:53,850
like I said,
I always wanted to be some kind of a 

421
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:53,850
commando and I would say that you,
when you joined the military,

422
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,320
I'd say people that are somewhat 
patriotic join the military,

423
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,410
but when you travel around the world and
you're in the military,

424
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:04,680
that kind of confirms your patriotism 
more than anything else because you see 

425
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,951
what the rest of the world is like and 
how unbelievably amazing America is.

426
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:11,260
And again,
how does America have faults?

427
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,630
Yeah,
America's got all kinds of faults.

428
00:22:13,631 --> 00:22:18,631
There's all kinds of things that we 
could do better and there's things that 

429
00:22:18,631 --> 00:22:21,181
we've done in the past that we shouldn't
have done and there's things that we'll 

430
00:22:21,181 --> 00:22:21,181
do in the future that we shouldn't have 
done,

431
00:22:21,181 --> 00:22:26,010
but when you compare that with the rest 
of the world and how the rest of the 

432
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,810
world lives and what it means to be in 
an oppressed society,

433
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,950
you know,
you,

434
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,620
you're extremely thankful to be in 
America.

435
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,770
This is once you've already been in the 
military and already started trout.

436
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:39,070
So this is just,
you just had this draw towards it almost

437
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:43,000
like your destiny to be in the military.
Yes,

438
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:48,690
that's a,
it's strange that it just came out of 

439
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,791
nowhere.
Like there was no like event in your 

440
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:53,281
life.
It just seemed like this was just 

441
00:22:53,281 --> 00:22:53,281
something that it was always,
you were always attracted to.

442
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:57,040
I mean,
running around the woods as a little kid

443
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,870
with bb guns,
shooting each other.

444
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,850
And that seemed like a good job.

445
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,600
And it's funny.
You don't seal teams,

446
00:23:04,601 --> 00:23:06,130
you don't,
you don't grow up,

447
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,000
you know,
you don't,

448
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:10,060
you continue with your childhood.
Uh,

449
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:15,250
you know,
play time for your whole adult life and 

450
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:15,250
it's awesome,
you know,

451
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,490
that's the best thing about the seal 
teams is you,

452
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:22,510
you get to do what you always wanted to 
do and they pay you money and you get 

453
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:26,110
unlimited ammunition,
unbelievably types of weapons,

454
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,690
bombs,
explosives,

455
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,380
no grenades,
and they just give it all to you.

456
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,300
And they say,
well,

457
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:36,130
they get excited when they find a guy 
like you.

458
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:41,310
We've got here,
we got a smart guy who was born to do 

459
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:41,310
this,
who's really looking forward to it.

460
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,970
It's perfect,
I guess.

461
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:45,040
So I'm sure the recruiter was pretty 
fired up when he met.

462
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:45,890
I would be,

463
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,110
if I was recruited out of the way,
let me sign the paper,

464
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,630
got one check,
check the boxes.

465
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,460
And um,
but it's,

466
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:57,530
it's Kinda,
it's even more intense because it's not 

467
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,420
just you get to play,
but only the strong get to play.

468
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,720
The week Oregon we weeded out.
And what's left is people have similar 

469
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:08,240
character.
That's what I've found most fascinating.

470
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,480
I think that's one of the things that's 
so romantic in the public's eye about 

471
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,890
the idea of the seals or green berets 
are rangers people that it's very 

472
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:22,631
difficult to get in there and only a 
select few have the intestinal 

473
00:24:22,631 --> 00:24:27,071
fortitude,
the willpower and the ability to lock 

474
00:24:27,071 --> 00:24:28,580
onto a task and a goal and get through 
it.

475
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:29,780
Yeah,

476
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:34,900
and then when you're in the seal teams,
none of that means anything and like all

477
00:24:35,121 --> 00:24:40,121
the training and all that selection 
process is just doesn't mean anything 

478
00:24:40,121 --> 00:24:43,721
because you all.
That's just a baseline of where 

479
00:24:43,721 --> 00:24:45,851
everyone's at.
And so when people talk about this 

480
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:45,851
intense training,
when you're in the seal teams,

481
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,930
you don't talk about that training that 
you go through to get an it.

482
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,190
That's just the baseline for everybody.

483
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:52,330
So it's just to make sure that you're 
not a pussy just exactly.

484
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,160
Exactly.
And here you are,

485
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,830
44 years old.
You're still getting up at 4:00

486
00:24:56,831 --> 00:25:01,030
in the morning doing dead lifts.
It never left you.

487
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,220
It did not leave me.
It's not going to.

488
00:25:03,221 --> 00:25:07,690
His aid is not going.
So you get through.

489
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,720
Once you get through the,
the intensity of buds and you get 

490
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,450
through,
you know,

491
00:25:13,451 --> 00:25:16,960
all the people that are going to quit 
and you get through all the training,

492
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:22,140
what is life like from there on out,
like how structured is like training and

493
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:26,260
physical activity and things like that 
from there on out,

494
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,120
you know,
again,

495
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,880
being in the seal teams is,
is awesome.

496
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:31,730
It's such a,
such a

497
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:36,730
fun job that I literally didn't consider
it a job except for maybe 13 months out 

498
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:41,300
of my career,
13 months I worked for,

499
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:46,530
uh,
the directly for the animal that was in 

500
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,611
charge of all the seals and it,
he's a great guy and I learned a ton 

501
00:25:48,801 --> 00:25:52,010
from him and from having that job,
but it wasn't a fun job.

502
00:25:52,011 --> 00:25:53,570
And even he would tell you it's not a 
fun job.

503
00:25:53,571 --> 00:25:54,480
You know,
you've got to uh,

504
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:59,700
you know,
you're wearing a uniform every day and 

505
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,871
in the regular seal teams you're,
you're wearing a pair of shorts and 

506
00:26:01,871 --> 00:26:05,050
you're barely wearing a shirt because 
you're out there in the field or you 

507
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:05,720
know,
getting ready to go in the field.

508
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:11,260
So it's a,
it's a great life and you're constantly 

509
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,971
training,
you're hanging out with a bunch of guys 

510
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:13,040
that are pretty much have the same 
attitude as you for the most part.

511
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:18,040
There's a couple guys that don't cut it 
and there's some guys that are super 

512
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,620
studs and you're,
you're doing your best to emulate them,

513
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,290
but you're hanging out with a bunch of 
great guys.

514
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,960
And you know,
when I was a young seal,

515
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:27,760
well we'd get to Friday and we'd,
you know,

516
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,060
go out,
have a beer,

517
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,730
we'd get done Saturday,
we'd still go to work Sunday,

518
00:26:31,731 --> 00:26:33,050
we'd still go to work,
we go work out,

519
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:34,850
we'd hang out,
we'd work on our gear,

520
00:26:34,851 --> 00:26:36,860
we'd get ready and there was even not 
even a war going on.

521
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,330
We were just into it,
you know,

522
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:42,260
we were just fired up for the seal teams
and that was so it's,

523
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,160
it's a great life.
And then once the war

524
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:49,160
started,
the intensity definitely picked up 

525
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,160
because you know,
everybody knew that we were going into 

526
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,270
combat and everyone pushed that much 
harder.

527
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:57,720
That being said,
back in the nineties,

528
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:03,290
we used to train really,
really hard because it was an unknown 

529
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:03,290
element,
you know,

530
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,620
there was an unknown element where you 
didn't know what was really going to.

531
00:27:05,621 --> 00:27:07,350
You didn't know what combat was really 
like.

532
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,140
So you trained as hard as you possibly 
could.

533
00:27:10,141 --> 00:27:15,141
Figure out how to train.
We trained and then once combat started 

534
00:27:15,141 --> 00:27:15,141
and we were like,
okay,

535
00:27:15,141 --> 00:27:15,690
well we kind of know what we're dealing 
with now.

536
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,990
It'd be like a fight or go into a camp 
if he's never fought in the UFC before,

537
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:21,180
he's going to train super hard to make 
his debut.

538
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:26,330
Well,
maybe after he wins really easily as 

539
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,951
first couple of fights,
maybe he backs off on that train and 

540
00:27:27,951 --> 00:27:27,951
capital.

541
00:27:27,951 --> 00:27:28,920
Not that we did that,
but it definitely mentally was there,

542
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,080
uh,
to,

543
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:34,350
to push hard even before combat.
So you just essentially saying that even

544
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,950
before you were going to war,
you were gonna be ready.

545
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:38,870
You,
you were,

546
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,330
you were going to make sure that you had
all your boxes checked,

547
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,910
you get all your ducks in a row,
100 percent.

548
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:49,370
How much physical training is there?
Once you're actually deployed it,

549
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,360
it depends on where you are and what 
you're doing,

550
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,480
you know,
it depends on what type of missions 

551
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:56,480
you're going on,
but you know,

552
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,630
being in the seal teams is a very 
physical job and again,

553
00:27:57,631 --> 00:27:58,950
you know what it is,
it's a baseline.

554
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:04,010
Everyone expects it.
You're gonna be able to put on your 

555
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:04,530
rucksack and your gear and go out and 
move and shoot and communicate.

556
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,560
That's the baseline.
Everyone's expected to do it and 

557
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:09,750
whatever you have to do to make that 
happen is,

558
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,280
is kind of on you.

559
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,800
Although we do do,
you know team,

560
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,780
what we call pt,
physical training,

561
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:20,781
but we do team pet,
but a lot of it is on you as an 

562
00:28:20,781 --> 00:28:21,330
individual or your smaller element,
you know,

563
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:23,850
group of guys and that's how you,
you to,

564
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:27,000
you got to stay in shape.
You do not want to be the guy that can't

565
00:28:27,001 --> 00:28:29,280
carry as can't carry his weight.
That's just,

566
00:28:29,281 --> 00:28:30,120
you'll,
you'll get,

567
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,460
you'll get kicked out.
So it's.

568
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:36,470
But it's not structured.
It's not organized like say if you're 

569
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,870
deployed in Iraq.
What I was getting at was I always 

570
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:41,901
wondered,
like I would imagine that the type of 

571
00:28:41,901 --> 00:28:41,901
workouts that you do,
they're exhausting,

572
00:28:41,901 --> 00:28:42,020
right?
You know,

573
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:47,030
you're dead lifting,
you doing cleans and presses and all 

574
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:47,220
this crazy shit and chin ups and running
up hills.

575
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,880
If you had to go to war,
right after a hard workout like that,

576
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,320
it's going to take something out of you.

577
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:57,350
Yeah.
You've gotta use you gotta use common 

578
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:57,350
sense.
Right?

579
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,950
So how do you know like when to stay in 
shape or what to do?

580
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,880
Yeah,
you're,

581
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,940
you're,
you're not going to do like a massive 

582
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,670
squat workout while you're on 
deployment.

583
00:29:05,671 --> 00:29:08,400
That's going to put you in there for 
three or four days.

584
00:29:08,401 --> 00:29:09,720
It's just not smart.
You know,

585
00:29:09,721 --> 00:29:11,970
you're gonna.
It's like a pavel,

586
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,180
you know the pavel.
Absolutely.

587
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,180
Yeah.
You know,

588
00:29:15,181 --> 00:29:20,181
he kind of.
I heard that from him years and years 

589
00:29:20,181 --> 00:29:20,181
ago,
you know,

590
00:29:20,181 --> 00:29:23,900
because he was trained in some swat guys
up in La and I talked to some of those 

591
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:23,900
guys and they said,
you know,

592
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,290
well,
don't,

593
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,040
you don't need to go to exhaustion to 
get stronger.

594
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:27,000
Says,
okay cool.

595
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,320
Let's try that.
And so,

596
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:31,050
you know,
you've got to be ready to operate,

597
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:36,051
that's your primary mission.
You got to be ready to go out on the 

598
00:29:36,051 --> 00:29:36,480
battlefield and get after it so you're 
not going to crush yourself so hard that

599
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,610
you're incapacitated.

600
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Yeah.
He's not a guy that believes in to 

601
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,000
failure.
Right.

602
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,370
He's got some interesting.
He doesn't ideas and I'm not like some,

603
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:50,371
uh,
some follower from just one of those 

604
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:50,371
things I heard along the way.
Yeah.

605
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,100
I mean,
look,

606
00:29:51,101 --> 00:29:53,320
there's a lot of different philosophies 
when it comes to training.

607
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:54,920
Um,
but when you,

608
00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:00,020
so when you're deployed,
it's essentially all entirely on you 

609
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:03,040
other than the group organized pt 
trainings just about.

610
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,000
Yeah,
just about.

611
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,470
So do you guys get together and say,
hey,

612
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,670
we're going to go running or we're going
to live today,

613
00:30:07,671 --> 00:30:11,950
or we're gonna go do some pull ups.
What about martial arts training?

614
00:30:11,951 --> 00:30:13,540
How much martial arts training is 
involved?

615
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,560
Again,
that depends on what the situation is 

616
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:19,560
and who you're working with.
You know,

617
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:23,611
if,
if you were a junior officer that was 

618
00:30:23,611 --> 00:30:24,910
working for me,
then you are going to be trained Jujitsu

619
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:25,210
all the time.

620
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:30,540
If they're working for you.
So it depends on who they're working 

621
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:30,540
for.
Yeah.

622
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:30,540
Uh,
you know,

623
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,020
I needed training partners and so I got 
them.

624
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:38,190
So when you did that,
would you take guys and teach them some 

625
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,490
basic stuff and then just choked the 
shit out of him?

626
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,190
Is that the move?
Pretty much.

627
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,900
Pretty much.
Do you talk them through it while you're

628
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:45,400
doing it?
Like defend,

629
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,470
get your arm here.
But,

630
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:48,190
you know,
I actually,

631
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,350
I would actually improve,
you know,

632
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,810
I'd go on deployment and come back and 
you know,

633
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:56,940
some guy that maybe I was having good 
battles with before I left to come back 

634
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,331
and be better because all of a sudden 
you go and work on really good offense 

635
00:31:00,331 --> 00:31:00,910
against a bunch of strong,
you know,

636
00:31:00,911 --> 00:31:04,870
psycho seals that don't want to tap and 
you've got to make it work.

637
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:05,680
So,
you know,

638
00:31:05,681 --> 00:31:07,660
I'd come back and,
and be better.

639
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,490
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't get worse on deployment.

640
00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:11,560
That's for sure.
Was that Sadie Bravo's theory?

641
00:31:11,561 --> 00:31:16,561
He believed that the real way to get 
better is not to train with people 

642
00:31:16,561 --> 00:31:20,521
better than you,
but to train with people that aren't as 

643
00:31:20,521 --> 00:31:21,340
good as you and just constantly drill 
finishes over and over and over again,

644
00:31:21,341 --> 00:31:26,341
sharpen them up like a Samurai sword,
and then when you do spar with people 

645
00:31:26,411 --> 00:31:31,411
that are your level or better,
you'll be much better just because 

646
00:31:31,411 --> 00:31:31,780
you're constantly used to finishing.
Yeah,

647
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,180
and I think there's a combination of 
both.

648
00:31:34,181 --> 00:31:39,181
You've got to train with people that are
better than you and you got to train 

649
00:31:39,181 --> 00:31:39,181
with people that are worse than you and 
you know,

650
00:31:39,181 --> 00:31:42,900
we do that in seal training to where 
because the seal training that I ran 

651
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,681
before I got out was not like the seal 
training where you see with the guys 

652
00:31:46,681 --> 00:31:49,510
with the the logs carrying those around 
or boats on the head that like I said,

653
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:52,600
that's the basic training in and no one 
really cares too much about that.

654
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,580
Once you get in the seal teams because 
it's just over,

655
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,560
it's just a smash you in the beginning 
smash.

656
00:31:56,561 --> 00:31:57,550
You make sure,
like you said,

657
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:02,580
make sure that you.
You're not opposed to exactly have the 

658
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,970
intestinal fortitude to bring it,
but once you get in the seal teams,

659
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:09,150
then you go through something called a 
workup and that's when you've got seal 

660
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:12,901
platoons that are trying to work 
together and we do crazy simulated 

661
00:32:12,901 --> 00:32:14,110
combat on these guys.
That is awesome.

662
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:14,670
I mean,
it's,

663
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:18,640
it's devastating.
And we have a paint ball.

664
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,250
Again,
this is like little kid stuff,

665
00:32:21,251 --> 00:32:21,820
right?
You get,

666
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,200
you get awesome.
Paintball,

667
00:32:23,201 --> 00:32:24,730
guns,
unlimited paintball rounds.

668
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,230
We had this,
this,

669
00:32:26,231 --> 00:32:31,231
uh,
like the best laser tag system that 

670
00:32:31,231 --> 00:32:35,761
anyone could ever imagine.
This crazy expensive laser tag system 

671
00:32:35,761 --> 00:32:40,321
where you could go out and fight each 
other with laser tag and when you were 

672
00:32:40,321 --> 00:32:40,321
getting at,
if the

673
00:32:40,321 --> 00:32:41,780
rounds weren't theoretically hitting 
you,

674
00:32:41,781 --> 00:32:46,781
then there was a little speaker on your 
shoulder that would make noises as if 

675
00:32:46,781 --> 00:32:50,051
rounds.
We're going over your head so that you 

676
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,851
would know to get down and there'd be 
explosions going off on these little 

677
00:32:51,851 --> 00:32:55,061
speakers.
And then when you get back from these 

678
00:32:55,061 --> 00:32:55,061
training operations,
the,

679
00:32:55,061 --> 00:32:57,800
all the,
they have little embedded gpss in them.

680
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:02,890
So you'd put it out on Google earth and 
you could watch the whole battle unfold 

681
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,280
and watch what people did right and 
wrong.

682
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:08,150
And my point in this is that sometimes 
many times,

683
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:13,151
especially in the beginning when the 
seals weren't quite up to speed yet and 

684
00:33:13,151 --> 00:33:13,280
they didn't know how to work together 
that well,

685
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,540
three or four or five opposing for seal.
So these are guys that are pretending to

686
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:19,400
be bad guys.
They would kill them all.

687
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,140
They would just go out there and murder 
them all.

688
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:26,680
And as these guys got better and started
to work together and the leadership 

689
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,020
started to step up and take command and,
and do a better job of leading,

690
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,200
then all of a sudden they,
the seals would start to beat the 

691
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,811
opposing force and annihilate them.
What an incredible tool to learn how to 

692
00:33:37,811 --> 00:33:41,621
organize and to,
to stay together and work together as a 

693
00:33:41,621 --> 00:33:41,900
team.
What did they used to do in the past?

694
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:46,960
Well that's,
that's a very interesting topic because 

695
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,700
it's very similar to,
you know,

696
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,630
what the UFC did to martial arts because
you know,

697
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:53,690
as you know,
in 1991,

698
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,330
you know,
you and I could sit here and talk it,

699
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:58,250
you could be a Kung Fu guy and I could 
be an Aikido guy and we could be like,

700
00:33:58,251 --> 00:34:03,251
no,
my martial arts better and you can be 

701
00:34:03,251 --> 00:34:04,991
saying the same thing and we could 
theoretically debated all day long but 

702
00:34:04,991 --> 00:34:05,750
we'd never actually do it.

703
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,300
And it's different.
So in combat,

704
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,290
obviously you can't,
you know,

705
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:09,950
we can't say,
okay,

706
00:34:09,951 --> 00:34:11,990
let's find out which one's better and 
we're on the same team,

707
00:34:11,991 --> 00:34:13,970
we're just going to kill each other to 
find out you can't do that.

708
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,300
So the first thing that happened was 
simunition and that's,

709
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:22,390
you know,
they basically started paintball but 

710
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:24,680
it's high speed paintball that fits in 
your real gun fits in a real,

711
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,240
a real gun.
So you take your,

712
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:28,700
you put a new barrel on your,
your standard,

713
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:33,900
you know,
issue weapon and now you're shooting 

714
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,100
paint balls out of your real gun.
You have 30 rounds.

715
00:34:34,101 --> 00:34:38,870
He changed magazines like very,
very similar to real combat and all of a

716
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:40,190
sudden just like a punching bag,
you know,

717
00:34:40,191 --> 00:34:40,700
when people say,
oh,

718
00:34:40,701 --> 00:34:42,220
the punching bag doesn't punch back 
what?

719
00:34:42,221 --> 00:34:47,221
When you go into a,
into a house and you shoot a bunch of 

720
00:34:47,221 --> 00:34:47,221
paper targets,
they don't move,

721
00:34:47,221 --> 00:34:47,221
they don't shoot back.

722
00:34:47,221 --> 00:34:47,221
So it's,
you know,

723
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:52,330
guess what,
you win every single time and you can 

724
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,150
get pretty confident with your tactics.
Your tactics aren't getting tested.

725
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,480
And so when,
when these great technologies come came 

726
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:58,480
out,
ammunition,

727
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,720
paint ball and these laser type systems,
it was a,

728
00:35:00,721 --> 00:35:03,410
it was a complete change and we 
definitely changed our tactics.

729
00:35:03,411 --> 00:35:08,411
Our tactics evolved,
just like fight tactics evolved with 

730
00:35:08,411 --> 00:35:08,411
the,
with the advent of the UFC.

731
00:35:08,411 --> 00:35:08,411
And people said,
oh,

732
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,610
this doesn't work the way we thought it 
did.

733
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,290
And you know,
this idea of,

734
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:17,291
oh,
we're just going to go running into a 

735
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:17,291
room and no one's going to stop no 
matter what.

736
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:20,620
No,
actually if there's a machine gun just 

737
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,780
lay in paint into you as you go in,
you're stupid if you go running into 

738
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,751
that room.
So we made these simple adjustments but 

739
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:28,540
it was an interesting progression and it
definitely imprinted the fact that you 

740
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,600
have to make your training as realistic 
as possible.

741
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:33,230
And it also,
it also shows you how people,

742
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:38,620
humans have a tendency to believe in 
what they're doing just because it's 

743
00:35:40,351 --> 00:35:42,090
kind of what they believe in.
And you know,

744
00:35:42,091 --> 00:35:42,980
again,
I think those,

745
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:47,670
those traditional martial arts that were
so popular back in the day,

746
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,430
people truly believed that like,
no,

747
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:52,270
I will actually stop you with,
you know,

748
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,090
with my ci,
my Ci will stop you.

749
00:35:54,091 --> 00:35:56,010
And they,
they really thought that I had one of my

750
00:35:56,011 --> 00:35:57,900
Jujitsu buddies was,
you know,

751
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,920
had some ci guy in 1995,
like,

752
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,330
you cannot take me down.
And he said,

753
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,200
well,
what do you mean?

754
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:04,800
And he said,
no,

755
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,390
I,
once I settle my ci,

756
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,060
you cannot take me down.
And he said,

757
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:09,810
well,
okay,

758
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,970
settle your,
do you want to try it?

759
00:36:11,971 --> 00:36:12,630
And the guy's like,
sure,

760
00:36:12,631 --> 00:36:14,520
you can try all you want.
So the guy you know,

761
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,350
stands there and settles,
is she out?

762
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,450
And my buddy goes,
are you ready?

763
00:36:18,451 --> 00:36:19,320
And he says,
yeah.

764
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,760
And he just like double legs and slammed
him on the ground,

765
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,180
but the guy believed it.
That's what's crazy.

766
00:36:24,181 --> 00:36:26,520
And that's what,
that's what people get get lured into,

767
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:26,770
you know,
the,

768
00:36:26,771 --> 00:36:29,430
our egos listen into a lot of stuff that
we need to watch out for.

769
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,210
Well

770
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,490
the belief is based on being taught by 
people who also believe it too.

771
00:36:35,491 --> 00:36:38,460
And it's so confusing because no one's 
experienced it in,

772
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:43,540
in real life,
which was why the initial question was 

773
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:47,450
when they used to prepare like back in 
Vietnam or you know,

774
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,670
during the,
uh,

775
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,310
the,
well,

776
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,800
when was this stuff invented?
Like we did,

777
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,160
they had it during the first Gulf War.

778
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,800
Barely,
barely.

779
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:58,440
Very small groups had it,
you know,

780
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:03,490
not,
not as many as should they have the 

781
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:03,490
laser setup and everything.
No,

782
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:03,490
we didn't get the good.
No,

783
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,190
they had that.
They had a worse laser system.

784
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,110
You know,
they've been trying to do it for years,

785
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,840
but what did they used to do like during
the Vietnam era,

786
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,980
go off of the experience of guys that 
had been in world war two and Korea to 

787
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,580
try and pass that on.
And Luckily,

788
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,720
and honestly,
you know,

789
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:25,060
being in combat,
the basic principles of combat are not 

790
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,750
the super crazy complex things,
you know,

791
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,870
the most basic principle that we talk 
about is cover and move,

792
00:37:30,871 --> 00:37:33,450
which is if you and I are going to go 
assault a building over there,

793
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,340
I'm going to,
I'm going to take cover.

794
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:40,420
I'm going to engage that building so 
that the enemy can't put their heads up 

795
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,600
and while I'm shooting at the building,
shooting where we think the enemy are,

796
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:45,360
you're going to get up and maneuver into
a better position.

797
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,870
Once you get into a better position and 
you get some cover,

798
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:53,930
you're going to start shooting at the 
enemy and that's going to allow me to 

799
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:54,240
move.
Once I get to a better position,

800
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:56,160
I'll start shooting again and we'll 
continue to do that.

801
00:37:56,161 --> 00:37:57,960
Supporting each other as we move to 
retarget.

802
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:00,030
And then once we get there,
we'll kill the bad guys and there'll be,

803
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,190
it'll be done.
That's the most basic principle.

804
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,430
But there's times where before,
you know,

805
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:10,460
in between Vietnam,
which is where we had major combat and 

806
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,581
people learned that cover moving guys 
that were in Vietnam were the people 

807
00:38:13,581 --> 00:38:16,341
that taught me covering move in between 
that time and the time when we started 

808
00:38:16,341 --> 00:38:17,940
using this ammunition and the and the 
lasers,

809
00:38:17,941 --> 00:38:22,941
the better products.
We actually forgot some of those 

810
00:38:22,941 --> 00:38:23,430
lessons.
As crazy as that might seem.

811
00:38:23,431 --> 00:38:27,420
We actually forgot some of these very 
simple basic lessons of,

812
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:32,540
of gun fighting.
And so it was great to have it back and 

813
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,050
it was when we were,
when we went to combat finally,

814
00:38:34,051 --> 00:38:35,980
we were more prepared for

815
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,670
it.
Yeah,

816
00:38:36,671 --> 00:38:38,650
I would imagine that kind of simulation 
you,

817
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,900
you're calling it simunition.
That's a,

818
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:44,740
that's an actual name brand.
And it's a name brand it,

819
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:45,790
that's the paint.
Yep.

820
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,190
So send me an issue is the paint and the
laser.

821
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:49,900
What is the name brand of that stuff?

822
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:55,090
One that we used was called debts and it
was made by sob and I don't know,

823
00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:01,020
I don't,
I don't even know if they still make it 

824
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:01,020
or if that contracts don't go in,
but it was awesome.

825
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,700
Yeah,
I like your analogy to martial arts,

826
00:39:02,701 --> 00:39:04,170
like testing it in,
in the,

827
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:09,180
in the actual competition because it 
would seem that that would be the only 

828
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:13,941
way that anybody would ever actually 
learn what mistakes not to make and how 

829
00:39:13,941 --> 00:39:17,961
they could easily be replicated in 
combat and then the repeated actions of 

830
00:39:18,601 --> 00:39:22,290
doing those over and over again and 
ingraining them in your mind is probably

831
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:27,270
the only thing that could really,
you could draw upon when you're in those

832
00:39:27,271 --> 00:39:29,430
intense situations of an actual 
firefighter.

833
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,620
Yeah,
and there's another good comparison.

834
00:39:31,621 --> 00:39:33,960
I don't know if you've ever heard 
somebody say this,

835
00:39:33,961 --> 00:39:36,390
but you know,
they'll say like,

836
00:39:36,391 --> 00:39:41,391
let's say I train some Kung Fu stuff 
where I'm and I attacker and I rip your 

837
00:39:41,391 --> 00:39:43,110
throat out and all that stuff and you 
train,

838
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,160
you know,
Jujitsu,

839
00:39:44,161 --> 00:39:45,390
Muay Thai,
wrestling and boxing.

840
00:39:45,391 --> 00:39:49,140
Right?
So people will say that you're not ready

841
00:39:49,141 --> 00:39:54,141
for the fact that I'm going to poke your
eyes out or you're not ready for the 

842
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,811
fact that I'm going to try and grab your
throat or whatever and therefore I have 

843
00:39:56,811 --> 00:40:00,111
an advantage and a and that you have 
some kind of a training scar because you

844
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,020
aren't used to doing that.
You see what I'm saying?

845
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:09,230
So if like I said,
if all I do is train to grab your eyes 

846
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:12,630
and poke your throat or whatever 
pressure point type attack,

847
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,040
then that means that I'm better prepared
for a street conflict.

848
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:24,060
And as you and I both know,
like a guy that does that versus a guy 

849
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,130
that trains in mixed martial arts,
boxing,

850
00:40:26,131 --> 00:40:27,130
wrestling,
Moitai,

851
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:32,150
Jujitsu,
that guy's going to destroy this other 

852
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:35,091
person in the street fight and the guy 
will grab for Xyz and then he's gonna 

853
00:40:35,091 --> 00:40:35,370
get his arm broken off and is going to 
get punched in at 47 times.

854
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,580
But my point in telling them that that 
is that this.

855
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:44,490
We had the same type of people in inside
the seal teams that said,

856
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:49,580
Oh,
if you get used to training with paint 

857
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,831
ball,
then you're going to develop training 

858
00:40:51,831 --> 00:40:54,720
scars from it so you're not going to be 
used to your regular weapon.

859
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:59,580
You're not going to be used to the 
recoil of a real gun and you're going to

860
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,720
have more courage because it's only 
going against paint and wall.

861
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:08,280
That while there's some small piece of 
truth to that,

862
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,850
just like there's some small piece of 
the truth to the fact that if,

863
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:15,990
if you never think about what it's like 
to be punched while you're doing 

864
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:19,041
Jujitsu,
well then it's going to be a surprise 

865
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:19,041
for you.

866
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:19,041
The first time you you are in guard with
someone and they crack you in the face.

867
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:20,880
There.
Some small truth who,

868
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:23,050
but it's not a reason to throw out,
you know,

869
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,410
that type of training.
It just doesn't make sense.

870
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,940
And the other thing that's good about it
is,

871
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,250
you know,
in Jujitsu and boxing and wrestling,

872
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,520
you're going live against another human 
being that's a maneuvering on you and 

873
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,780
trying to defeat you.
And when you have paint ball or laser,

874
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:40,990
you're going against another human being
that's trying to maneuver on you and 

875
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:43,721
defeat you.
So therefore it's very effective in 

876
00:41:43,721 --> 00:41:43,880
teaching and what real combat is going 
to be like.

877
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,200
What was it like the first time you were
deployed and when was that?

878
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:53,180
The first time I was deployed in 2003 
and deployed to Baghdad,

879
00:41:53,181 --> 00:41:55,490
Iraq.
And it was great.

880
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,980
That's not what most people would think 
of.

881
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,580
It wouldn't never think of that word.
It's very it.

882
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,930
What was interesting about my first 
deployment to Iraq was that again,

883
00:42:08,931 --> 00:42:13,931
I was so happy to be in a position where
I was a platoon commander and we were 

884
00:42:16,671 --> 00:42:20,720
doing real missions and I was excited 
and happy about that.

885
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:25,900
And you know,
that doesn't mean I was running around 

886
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,840
smile on my face and we had a legit job 
and we had to get it done.

887
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:30,770
It was also a time where the,
the insurgents,

888
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,770
there wasn't an insurgency yet.
We hadn't even really heard that word in

889
00:42:33,771 --> 00:42:38,771
2003.
And so the operations that we did were 

890
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,960
relatively simple and our tactical 
advantage over the enemy was good enough

891
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:50,630
that we just annihilated them,
you know,

892
00:42:50,631 --> 00:42:53,930
it was like,
it was like an unfair fight,

893
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,010
which is how you want it to be.

894
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,510
You want to have an unfair fight in 
combat.

895
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:58,370
And so we would go in,
you know,

896
00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:59,750
2:00
in the morning,

897
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:02,950
we'd find out what a bad guy was in some
house or some officer,

898
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:07,970
some building,
and we'd load up our vehicles and go in 

899
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:09,980
the middle of the night,
blast their door open with big explosive

900
00:43:09,981 --> 00:43:13,100
breaching charge,
clear their house in about 30 seconds,

901
00:43:13,101 --> 00:43:15,200
grab them,
grab their buddies,

902
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,640
bring them all back,
interrogate them,

903
00:43:16,641 --> 00:43:18,740
find out where their friends are and go 
out and do it again.

904
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,400
And it was awesome and it was awesome.
And it was like a rockstar deployment.

905
00:43:22,401 --> 00:43:27,401
We'd come home at 3:00
in the morning and be done and debrief 

906
00:43:28,191 --> 00:43:30,200
the operation and get ready to do it the
next day.

907
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:35,000
We probably were in four or five 
firefights during that whole deployment.

908
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,760
Couple ambushes and I had one guy get,
get wounded,

909
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,940
not very bad.
So it was,

910
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:45,800
it was,
it was funny,

911
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:49,790
it was good and we were ready for it.
Um,

912
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:54,770
and the contrast comes when you go to my
next deployment,

913
00:43:55,010 --> 00:44:00,010
the next deployment to Ramadi,
which was completely different.

914
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,960
So and on that deployment,
everything bad that can happen too.

915
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,050
A guy in a leadership position or an 
element happened to us,

916
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,390
everything bad that could happen,
happened.

917
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:26,470
And so it was,
it was radically different than my first

918
00:44:26,471 --> 00:44:31,471
deployment.
So your first deployment was a in a 

919
00:44:31,471 --> 00:44:32,160
sense a like what people

920
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,160
expected the war to go,
like after we had experienced Desert 

921
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:37,920
Storm,
Desert Storm,

922
00:44:37,921 --> 00:44:42,921
which was just an overwhelming success.
Just the only casualties were when that 

923
00:44:43,741 --> 00:44:48,741
one Scud missile had hid a barracks and 
it was just,

924
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:51,570
that was what America thought war was 
like,

925
00:44:51,571 --> 00:44:53,550
well this is how good we are at it right
now.

926
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,240
We just go over there and we kill 
everybody and we lose a couple people.

927
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:58,920
And real sad about that.
But

928
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:03,630
we wrapped it up tight.
So your second deployment,

929
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:08,070
what was that like and how did it begin?

930
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:15,830
Well,
it began with our deployment orders 

931
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:19,581
changing,
so we were literally two weeks from 

932
00:45:19,581 --> 00:45:19,890
going on deployment.
So now my first deployment to Iraq,

933
00:45:19,891 --> 00:45:24,891
I was what's called a platoon commander.
I had 15 or 20 guys underneath me 

934
00:45:24,891 --> 00:45:27,870
depending on what time during the 
deployment it was.

935
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,810
And we were an assault force.
We were like,

936
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:34,410
we jokingly called ourselves Baghdad 
Swat because that's what we did.

937
00:45:34,411 --> 00:45:36,210
I just kind of describe what those 
missions were like.

938
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:42,080
My second deployment now I was what's 
called a task unit commander and I had 

939
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:46,550
two of those seal platoons with 15 to 20
guys that were underneath me and then we

940
00:45:49,651 --> 00:45:54,651
had another 70,
60 or 70 support personnel.

941
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,030
So these are people that do Intel 
people,

942
00:45:57,031 --> 00:46:02,031
that man the radios,
people that clean and repair our weapons

943
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:04,320
and people that keep the camera running 
and all that.

944
00:46:04,321 --> 00:46:05,280
So it's,
it's,

945
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,840
it's about 100 guys,
but there's only 35 or 40 seals.

946
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:13,890
And we found out about two weeks before 
we went on deployment,

947
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,290
our deployment changed instead of going 
to Baghdad.

948
00:46:16,291 --> 00:46:20,400
And really doing more bag that swat 
operations we went,

949
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:23,880
we were told we were going to Ramadi and
I was again,

950
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,380
and people always say,
you know,

951
00:46:27,381 --> 00:46:32,381
I can't believe you fought that and I 
can't believe how twisted you are and 

952
00:46:32,381 --> 00:46:35,651
all,
I can't believe what a sick individual 

953
00:46:35,651 --> 00:46:35,651
you are and et Cetera,
et Cetera,

954
00:46:35,651 --> 00:46:35,651
et cetera.
But yes,

955
00:46:35,651 --> 00:46:38,990
I was extremely happy and motivated that
we're going to Ramadi because it was the

956
00:46:38,991 --> 00:46:42,020
worst place in Iraq and that is exactly 
where I wanted to be my whole life.

957
00:46:42,021 --> 00:46:43,370
So yes,
I was fired up to go there.

958
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:45,430
Just so

959
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:46,700
crazy.
I mean,

960
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:50,570
it's so counterintuitive to the way most
people think.

961
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:56,990
I guess so.
And I hung around with a bunch of guys 

962
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:57,570
that thought the same damn thing is me.
Let's go get these guys.

963
00:46:57,571 --> 00:46:58,260
Let's get after it.

964
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:01,680
Well,
that's why you are who you are.

965
00:47:01,681 --> 00:47:02,190
I mean,
that's,

966
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:06,220
that's why it's important to have people
like you in the world like this.

967
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:11,320
Like there's a spectrum of human beings.
There is a spectrum of human being and 

968
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:15,201
you're,
you're on the extreme edge of exactly 

969
00:47:15,201 --> 00:47:16,710
what you want.
When you have an army,

970
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:21,980
have you put together a military force?
You want a guy like you that has that 

971
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:26,391
attitude.
You don't want a guy who's going to the 

972
00:47:26,391 --> 00:47:26,391
worst place in the world saying,
Oh,

973
00:47:26,391 --> 00:47:28,440
why me?
What the fuck?

974
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,010
Why didn't I become a Baker like

975
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,560
my dad?
I could be making cupcakes right now.

976
00:47:32,561 --> 00:47:34,210
Instead I'm shooting people.
Yeah,

977
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:34,720
yeah.
No,

978
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:35,290
you,
uh,

979
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:36,230
and,
and,

980
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:41,280
and the seal teams and the Rangers and 
the special forces does a very good job 

981
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:46,360
of attracting the type of people that 
you're talking about,

982
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:51,420
the type of people that are fired up to 
do that job and not encouraging it and 

983
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:56,280
growing it like you did.
It seems like the amount of camaraderie 

984
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:00,640
and the intensity of the friendships and
the bond,

985
00:48:00,641 --> 00:48:04,000
that brotherhood that you developed with
those people just intensifies it all.

986
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:06,340
Yeah.
It's a big gang.

987
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:11,760
It's a big,
it's a big awesome gang that you're a 

988
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,821
part of that's bad ass.
And you're part of this fraternity is 

989
00:48:14,821 --> 00:48:16,570
brotherhood.
So yeah,

990
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,860
they definitely fuel the fire and,
and I should say,

991
00:48:20,861 --> 00:48:23,440
I shouldn't say they fuel the fire,
we fueled the fire.

992
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:24,820
We're,
we are the fire,

993
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:26,170
you know,
the guys that are there,

994
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:31,530
the guys that I worked with,
they're fired up guys that are 

995
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,220
completely ready to do this job.

996
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:35,740
So you get over there,
you're in Ramadi,

997
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:40,890
totally different situation than banked 
at totally different situation in 

998
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:43,330
Baghdad.
And he immediately realizes immediately,

999
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:49,060
immediately we were going.
I mean I think,

1000
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:54,120
I think we went to the first memorial 
service for an American within,

1001
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,860
you know,
24 hours of being on the ground there.

1002
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,730
We,
my,

1003
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:01,720
my,
my camp got attacked the,

1004
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:06,960
I dunno,
maybe the third or fourth night that we 

1005
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,701
were there,
every guy was on the roof of our 

1006
00:49:08,701 --> 00:49:10,861
building,
shooting back at bad guys that were 

1007
00:49:10,861 --> 00:49:11,200
shooting at us.
It was.

1008
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:16,320
And then,
and then we started conducting 

1009
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,701
operations almost immediately.
And the operations were just,

1010
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:22,890
just radically different.
I mean the enemy owned the downtown area

1011
00:49:23,171 --> 00:49:23,930
from Audi.
They,

1012
00:49:23,931 --> 00:49:28,931
they were the dominant force down there.
So whereas before you'd be going through

1013
00:49:29,141 --> 00:49:31,420
kind of semi permissive environment in 
Baghdad,

1014
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,240
meaning that,
you know,

1015
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:39,360
it's a,
it's a bunch of civilians and they just 

1016
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:39,360
wanted to get out of your way and then 
you'd go and find this bad guy,

1017
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,530
well in Ramadi,
the bad guys,

1018
00:49:41,531 --> 00:49:46,531
we're going to find you.
And it was different and they were 

1019
00:49:46,531 --> 00:49:47,050
everywhere.
They were who had trained them.

1020
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:51,640
Some of them were former regime 
elements,

1021
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,370
so some of them were.
Ramadi was a,

1022
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:57,940
was an Iraqi military city as well.
So there's some of them leftover,

1023
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:02,650
actually a bunch of them leftover.
And then you had Syrians coming in,

1024
00:50:02,651 --> 00:50:04,020
foreign fighters,
uh,

1025
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,460
people coming in from all over Saudi 
Arabia,

1026
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:07,200
Jordan,
I mean,

1027
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:12,240
they'd come in from all over the place 
to come and engage and get their Jihad 

1028
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,210
on.
And with a motivated because America was

1029
00:50:13,211 --> 00:50:15,690
now occupying Iraq because that,
what was,

1030
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:21,440
was driving them,
I think more than the fact that that 

1031
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,440
America was occupying Iraq,
is that they wanted to take that land.

1032
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:28,470
I mean,
America was no longer occupying Iraq 

1033
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:28,470
when they went in and took Ramadi this 
time.

1034
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:30,260
We were going,
we'd been gone for four years,

1035
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:34,580
so the occupation of Iraq was not the 
driving force behind this.

1036
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,570
So once you get there,
once you realize right away,

1037
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:39,380
it's different.

1038
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,440
You're experiencing casualties at a 
level that was unheard of in Baghdad and

1039
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:50,150
you are engaging with an enemy that's 
very prepared and overwhelming.

1040
00:50:50,151 --> 00:50:52,250
They're everywhere.
And they did.

1041
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:57,610
They were similar to us,
meaning they did like a first world 

1042
00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:00,770
country type stuff.
They had met a medical evacuation.

1043
00:51:00,771 --> 00:51:02,360
Plans are one of their guys would get 
wounded.

1044
00:51:02,361 --> 00:51:03,890
You'd see them get evacuated,
you know,

1045
00:51:03,891 --> 00:51:06,350
you could watch on,
on the screens,

1046
00:51:06,351 --> 00:51:11,351
you could watch what was happening.
A vehicle would come in and gathered 

1047
00:51:11,351 --> 00:51:12,230
them up and take one of the guys away.
They'd bring in reinforcements.

1048
00:51:12,231 --> 00:51:14,810
They had communications,
they did fire maneuver.

1049
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:18,650
They did the same basic tactics that I 
was talking about.

1050
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:23,680
They did those tactics as well.
And so it was a real well trained and 

1051
00:51:25,161 --> 00:51:27,950
well coordinated and determined enemy.
Was this expected?

1052
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,650
Well,
we knew what Ramadi was like.

1053
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:36,110
Um,
but I would say it was expected,

1054
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:42,950
but it's hard to mentally picture what 
that's going to be like when you,

1055
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:45,410
when you're going to go up against guys 
that are that prepared.

1056
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:51,100
So this was tactically and as far as 
like the strategy that was involved to 

1057
00:51:54,171 --> 00:51:59,171
try to take a city like that.
This was a fairly new experience for the

1058
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:00,710
United States military,
right?

1059
00:52:00,711 --> 00:52:05,711
We,
we'd never had what other being other 

1060
00:52:05,711 --> 00:52:06,710
what Somalia,
like what other urban war had a,

1061
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:09,800
the United States engaged in like this 
where you're in a city.

1062
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:14,860
Well,
I mean obviously World War Two had all 

1063
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,040
kinds of conflict and in Vietnam there 
was portions,

1064
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:16,880
you know,
the battle of waste,

1065
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:22,050
waste city was a huge urban conflict.
Somalia was definitely urban combat,

1066
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,660
but you're right in the fact that we 
weren't going in there to try and stay.

1067
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:32,110
And that was one of the biggest 
differences or changes in strategies 

1068
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:35,930
that the US military had that turned the
war around.

1069
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:41,050
And that was as the,
as the insurgence grew and it's 2004,

1070
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:46,870
2005,
the insurgency started getting more and 

1071
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:49,481
more unified and better and more well 
trained and more organized and America.

1072
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:57,820
What we did was kind of go back to our 
strong basis.

1073
00:52:58,161 --> 00:53:01,100
So there's basis.
You got to understand this in Iraq,

1074
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:02,930
2005,
2006,

1075
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:06,860
if you went to a base in let's say 
Baghdad International Airport,

1076
00:53:06,861 --> 00:53:10,830
there was a huge US military base.
There was a subway,

1077
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:13,640
the sandwich shop,
subway,

1078
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:18,670
starbucks.
These places have become little little 

1079
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:21,970
outcroppings of America.
And so what we did when the insurgency 

1080
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:25,481
got worse and worse and worse,
and also the public opinion of the war 

1081
00:53:25,481 --> 00:53:28,721
went down and down and,
and all of a sudden we're sitting here 

1082
00:53:28,721 --> 00:53:28,721
going,

1083
00:53:28,721 --> 00:53:31,030
wow,
we're not going to want to minimize 

1084
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:31,030
casualties as much as possible.
So what does that mean?

1085
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:32,070
You do?
You go back to your base.

1086
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:34,710
And we,
we did that as a country.

1087
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:35,610
We kind of said,
okay,

1088
00:53:35,611 --> 00:53:37,170
we're not going to take huge risks 
anymore.

1089
00:53:37,171 --> 00:53:42,171
We're going to pull back to our basis.
We're going to try and support the 

1090
00:53:42,171 --> 00:53:44,241
Iraqis as much as we can and let them go
out and try and accomplish missions and 

1091
00:53:44,241 --> 00:53:48,801
we still did do missions,
but we definitely had strong and move 

1092
00:53:50,751 --> 00:53:52,020
back to these big basis.

1093
00:53:55,120 --> 00:54:00,120
There was a guy a there.
There were several people and one of 

1094
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:00,120
them was general Patraeus.
He wrote this,

1095
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,430
you know the counterinsurgency manual 
now.

1096
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:06,480
Now.
Now what you had was you went from this 

1097
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,310
idea of we're fighting kind of 
terrorists and all of a sudden you're 

1098
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:09,760
fighting an organized insurgency,
and that was a huge strategy,

1099
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:14,790
strategic shift,
and so now instead of going out and 

1100
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:15,880
grabbing a bad guy and then coming back 
the the,

1101
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:21,030
the new strategy,
and it was implemented in Ramadi by a 

1102
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:25,420
guy named Colonel Sean Mcfarland was c's
clear hold and build,

1103
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:27,760
which means you're going to go into 
these enemy controlled neighborhoods.

1104
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:30,670
You're going to take buildings,
you're going to hold those buildings.

1105
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:34,540
You're going to build them into your own
fortes and you're going to have American

1106
00:54:34,541 --> 00:54:39,541
and Iraqi soldiers live in those enemy 
controlled territory's until the enemy 

1107
00:54:39,541 --> 00:54:39,541
was gone.

1108
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:44,670
Had that ever been implemented before?
It had been implemented in [inaudible] 

1109
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:50,160
in northern Iraq by a guy named h Dot h 
Dot r dot mcmaster was another kind of 

1110
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,590
legendary,
a military army colonel at the time.

1111
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:56,320
All these guys are generals now because 
they're awesome guys.

1112
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:59,590
He'd implemented up there.
He actually turned that plan over.

1113
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:02,590
Two Gentlemen,
Farlane and gentlemen.

1114
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:05,440
Foreman came down to Ramadi and 
implemented the plan there,

1115
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:10,650
but what was,
what was hard to understand is no one 

1116
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:13,180
really knew about this.
No one understood it all.

1117
00:55:13,181 --> 00:55:14,980
They all they said was,
oh my God,

1118
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:20,430
wait a second.
You're saying we're going to go into 

1119
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:21,871
these enemy controlled neighborhoods 
where were there haven't been American 

1120
00:55:21,871 --> 00:55:22,540
or coalition forces for a year,
year and a half,

1121
00:55:22,541 --> 00:55:27,541
two years.
You're saying we're going to go in 

1122
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:27,541
there.
Right before we arrived in Ramadi,

1123
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:29,620
there was a road that the marine corps 
tried to penetrate down.

1124
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:34,620
They hit 13 ids and 500 meters,
so 1330 $500.

1125
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:38,710
So essentially what is 500 meters is 
like,

1126
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:41,770
it's every 50 meters or so,
a little less than 50 meters.

1127
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,610
What does that football fields,
how much I foot five football fields.

1128
00:55:45,611 --> 00:55:46,720
Yeah,
that's insane.

1129
00:55:46,721 --> 00:55:48,130
That is.
Wow.

1130
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:53,820
So,
so this new strategy to go in there and 

1131
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:57,151
pushing there was considered to be by 
many people was considered to be too 

1132
00:55:57,401 --> 00:56:00,310
risky,
too dangerous and,

1133
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:04,600
and really in some cases crazy.
Like this is a crazy strategy.

1134
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:10,080
We haven't been able to get down there 
and now you're saying we're gonna go 

1135
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:10,080
down there and live there.
So it was a,

1136
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:13,570
it was a very dynamic change.
So this is a gigantic,

1137
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:17,950
gritty boots on the ground approach to 
taking over a city,

1138
00:56:17,951 --> 00:56:21,910
like one step at a time,
but one building at a time.

1139
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:23,920
That's it.
Wow.

1140
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:28,900
That had to be insane.
Yeah.

1141
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:34,130
Yeah.
Is there any documentary footage of 

1142
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:36,211
this?
Were there any embedded journalists 

1143
00:56:36,211 --> 00:56:36,211
embedded journalists?
You know,

1144
00:56:36,211 --> 00:56:38,020
you can go on youtube and just Google 
Ramadi,

1145
00:56:38,021 --> 00:56:40,090
2006 and you'll,
you'll see some good stuff.

1146
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:43,600
There is a documentary that came out,
I think it was on the history channel.

1147
00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:47,590
It's called a chance in hell,
the battle for Ramadi and that.

1148
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:50,500
What's good about that one is it 
interviews.

1149
00:56:50,501 --> 00:56:55,060
A lot of guys that we worked with while 
we were there and what I was just trying

1150
00:56:55,061 --> 00:57:00,061
to convey to you about the fact that a 
lot of people were saying this was a 

1151
00:57:00,061 --> 00:57:04,201
suicidal operation.
You can hear these guys that were 

1152
00:57:04,201 --> 00:57:04,630
officers in charge of battalions and 
companies.

1153
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:10,140
They're saying the same thing there.
They were getting told by their peers 

1154
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:12,691
like,
this is a crazy idea and you guys are 

1155
00:57:12,691 --> 00:57:12,691
all going to die if you go in there.

1156
00:57:12,691 --> 00:57:16,890
Wow.
Now what is morale like when something 

1157
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:20,461
like that gets brought down,
when these are the orders and this is 

1158
00:57:20,461 --> 00:57:23,710
what you have to do and everyone's 
telling you it's a suicide mission.

1159
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:27,940
Well that's,
that's where leadership comes in because

1160
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:29,370
you know,
one of the,

1161
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:34,380
one of the toughest things that I ever 
had to convey to my guys was this fact 

1162
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:38,590
that we were going to be working 
alongside Iraqi soldiers,

1163
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:40,930
conventional Iraqi soldier.
So you picture this.

1164
00:57:40,931 --> 00:57:43,060
We have that first appointment I talked 
about.

1165
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,360
We were,
we were only working with seals,

1166
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,710
seals.
The guy to your left was a sealed.

1167
00:57:48,711 --> 00:57:51,040
The guy to your right was the CEO.
The guy behind you as a seal,

1168
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:53,200
the guy who you can trust and who you 
can trust them,

1169
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,540
you knew them.
They were,

1170
00:57:54,541 --> 00:57:57,790
they were your brothers.
So now we get to Ramadi,

1171
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:03,180
and the mission changed coming down from
the special operations forces that were 

1172
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,710
in charge of,
of all special operations in Iraq,

1173
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:10,770
and the new,
the new mission was to the new mission.

1174
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:13,540
I'm trying to think of the exact,
uh,

1175
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:18,690
was to train and fight company and 
platoon sized elements of Iraqi 

1176
00:58:19,091 --> 00:58:21,270
soldiers.
Train and fight company,

1177
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:23,350
platoon size elements of Iraqi soldiers.
And when they say fight,

1178
00:58:23,351 --> 00:58:27,010
that means like that's a verb saying 
we're going to fight with them.

1179
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:30,970
So all of a sudden I'm telling my guys,
hey,

1180
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:33,250
you know how you're used to working with
a bunch of seals.

1181
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:35,290
You're going to.
Now when you go out,

1182
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:40,320
the majority of the guys,
you're going to be with our Iraqi 

1183
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,901
soldiers.
That's the majority of guys now Iraqi 

1184
00:58:42,901 --> 00:58:44,410
soldiers are,
they're,

1185
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:44,970
they're,
they're,

1186
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:48,730
they're barely even military.
I mean people.

1187
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:52,000
They're just unmotivated,
poorly trained.

1188
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:58,110
In fact,
in many cases their loyalty is 

1189
00:58:58,110 --> 00:58:58,110
questionable.
I mean,

1190
00:58:58,110 --> 00:58:58,450
these are guys that would shoot 
Americans in the back.

1191
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,760
So now I'm telling my guys,
okay,

1192
00:59:00,761 --> 00:59:01,780
you're gonna,
go out there and do this.

1193
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:07,470
And obviously the first reaction I got 
was a,

1194
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,670
this is,
this is crap,

1195
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:12,040
this garbage.
Why would we ever do that?

1196
00:59:12,041 --> 00:59:15,160
This is the worst battlefield seals have
fought on since Vietnam.

1197
00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:20,310
And you want us to go out there with a 
bunch of a bunch of Iraqi soldiers 

1198
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:21,320
watching our back.
That's crazy.

1199
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,910
And,
and when I heard it,

1200
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:24,790
I thought it was crazy too.

1201
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:29,470
So what do you do?
Then what?

1202
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,370
What do you do?
Then you're going to send your guys into

1203
00:59:31,371 --> 00:59:36,371
harm's way in a much more vulnerable way
and you got to get them to do it.

1204
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:43,010
So first of all,
I had to understand what we're doing on,

1205
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:45,320
in my own mind.
I had to understand why.

1206
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:50,440
I understand,
why would somebody be telling us to do 

1207
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:50,440
this?
Because it seems freaking crazy to me.

1208
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:55,130
So as I sat there and thought about it,
I realized,

1209
00:59:55,131 --> 00:59:55,490
you know,
okay,

1210
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:58,820
why is,
why is the president making us do this?

1211
00:59:58,821 --> 01:00:01,640
Why is the general the,
why is the Pentagon making us do this?

1212
01:00:01,641 --> 01:00:04,550
Why are the generals and colonels on the
battlefield here in Iraq?

1213
01:00:04,551 --> 01:00:08,060
Why in God's name would they be making 
us go out with Iraqi soldiers?

1214
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,190
It's crazy,
and then I thought to myself,

1215
01:00:10,191 --> 01:00:10,520
well,
okay,

1216
01:00:10,521 --> 01:00:11,810
why?
Let's answer that question.

1217
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:13,910
Oh,
news flash,

1218
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:19,240
if we don't do it,
if we don't get the Iraqi soldiers 

1219
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:23,350
trained up and ready to maintain the 
security in their own country than who's

1220
01:00:23,781 --> 01:00:25,580
going to do it,
who's going to do it?

1221
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,590
Who's going to train them?
And furthermore,

1222
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:29,360
who's gonna hold the security and our 
country?

1223
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,460
And the answer was nobody in the answer 
was us.

1224
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:36,790
The answer was we would be here forever 
because these Iraqis need to be able to 

1225
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:40,391
get up and stand on their own two feet.
And so when I explained that to my guys 

1226
01:00:40,391 --> 01:00:40,790
like,
Hey,

1227
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:42,650
I know you don't want to work with Iraqi
soldiers.

1228
01:00:42,651 --> 01:00:44,450
I understand.
I understand there's more risk.

1229
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:49,480
Here's why we're doing it.
We're doing it because if we don't do 

1230
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:49,550
it,
if we don't get these guys up to speed,

1231
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:53,810
if we don't teach them how to defend 
themselves and how to defeat this enemy,

1232
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:59,230
they're never going to be able to do it 
and we'll be mired in this conflict 

1233
01:00:59,230 --> 01:00:59,230
forever.

1234
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:03,430
And once,
once they understood that strategic 

1235
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:05,621
picture,
they were able to get their head around 

1236
01:01:05,621 --> 01:01:06,830
it and then slowly accepted what we were
doing.

1237
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:12,370
How common were there complications from
dealing with the Iraqi soldiers and did 

1238
01:01:14,691 --> 01:01:19,691
you guys have to take steps in order to,
to watch over them to make sure when 

1239
01:01:19,691 --> 01:01:24,681
you're talking about guys shooting guys 
in the back shooting Americans in the 

1240
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,221
back,
did you have plans in place to make sure

1241
01:01:27,321 --> 01:01:29,270
that someone was watching them at all 
times?

1242
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:29,950
Yeah.
Yeah.

1243
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:31,940
So you didn't,
you couldn't treat them like,

1244
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,800
did some,
did they speak English?

1245
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:34,520
Uh,
no.

1246
01:01:34,521 --> 01:01:37,280
We had interpreters and oh yeah,
it's a nightmare.

1247
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:38,260
Um,
and,

1248
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:43,261
and,
and we would have some of the Iraqi 

1249
01:01:43,261 --> 01:01:43,261
soldiers,
some of them,

1250
01:01:43,261 --> 01:01:44,420
some of the leadership of the Iraqi 
soldiers would be very good.

1251
01:01:44,421 --> 01:01:47,660
Some of the grunts would be very good.
And someone will just disastrous.

1252
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:48,770
And did we have to change?
Yeah,

1253
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:54,460
they didn't.
We had to change our tactics so that we 

1254
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:57,461
didn't use the terms left and right 
because they didn't understand left and 

1255
01:01:57,461 --> 01:01:59,120
right or no numbers.
A lot of them couldn't count.

1256
01:01:59,121 --> 01:01:59,750
I mean,
it was.

1257
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:00,770
They couldn't count.
Yeah.

1258
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,840
Yeah.
So they're totally on educated,

1259
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,940
totally uneducated.
Wow.

1260
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:07,880
Can't count.
Holy Shit.

1261
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:11,240
Go four doors down.
[inaudible]

1262
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:14,250
something you can tell a five year old.
Yes.

1263
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:16,270
Whoa.
Yeah.

1264
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,550
So,
so that was,

1265
01:02:17,551 --> 01:02:22,551
that was definitely challenging.
I think allowed to call them savages 

1266
01:02:22,551 --> 01:02:22,551
when they can't count.
Is that,

1267
01:02:22,551 --> 01:02:25,350
is that the rule?
If you don't count the four I reserve,

1268
01:02:25,351 --> 01:02:29,090
I reserve the term savage for somebody 
that carb commits,

1269
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:31,950
you know,
atrocities against human beings.

1270
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:37,010
You know,
somebody that rapes an eight year old 

1271
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:37,010
girl,
like they're doing wholesale doing that.

1272
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:39,660
And Isis is doing that right now.
That's part of their gig.

1273
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:40,740
Uh,
yeah.

1274
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:41,260
I,
I,

1275
01:02:41,330 --> 01:02:46,330
I reserve the term savages for them.
So what steps did you guys have to take 

1276
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:51,290
to ensure that the seals and the other 
American soldiers were protected in 

1277
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,770
working with these people?
I mean,

1278
01:02:52,771 --> 01:02:54,340
you just have to keep your eye on him.
I mean,

1279
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:56,880
and honestly at this point,
the,

1280
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,400
you saw this,
this,

1281
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:02,340
uh,
happen a lot more than Afghanistan,

1282
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:04,630
which was the,
what do they call it,

1283
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:05,410
the color,

1284
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:10,110
I forget what they,
they have a term for it,

1285
01:03:10,111 --> 01:03:15,111
but when the,
when the friendly allegedly friendly 

1286
01:03:15,111 --> 01:03:17,991
Afghan soldier turns in,
shoots everyone in the back that 

1287
01:03:17,991 --> 01:03:20,541
happened more later in Afghanistan and 
when we were in Iraq it was pretty 

1288
01:03:20,541 --> 01:03:21,960
seldom that it happened,
but we just had to be aware of it and we

1289
01:03:21,961 --> 01:03:22,860
had to,
you know,

1290
01:03:22,861 --> 01:03:26,070
you always had a guy that was standing 
off the firing line and making sure that

1291
01:03:26,071 --> 01:03:27,280
no one was,
you know,

1292
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,790
pulling their weapon out and aiming at 
Americans.

1293
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:31,470
So that was a job.
Yeah.

1294
01:03:31,471 --> 01:03:33,330
I would just,
you gotta keep an eye on these guys.

1295
01:03:33,331 --> 01:03:37,290
You absolutely crazy added element and 
the other,

1296
01:03:37,291 --> 01:03:40,320
I mean it just again,
because there's dichotomy and everything

1297
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:42,600
at the same time,
you'd have some guy that was,

1298
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:47,630
you know,
some Iraqi soldier that was willing to 

1299
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:47,630
take a bullet for your buddy.

1300
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:51,600
And so it's,
that's what makes war so complex.

1301
01:03:51,601 --> 01:03:54,090
And confusing is it's not cut and dry 
and it never is.

1302
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:59,630
So how did it start panning out once you
started this cs?

1303
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:05,190
Clear hold and build.
It was a tough fight.

1304
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,560
Basically with every one of these combat
outposts,

1305
01:04:07,561 --> 01:04:08,450
that's what we ended up.
Uh,

1306
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:10,440
what they ended up calling these combat 
outposts.

1307
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:13,710
Every one of them was a pretty,
a pretty tough fight to the revit.

1308
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:15,810
Their buildings,
they're calling them combat APA,

1309
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:17,670
combat outposts.
What kind of the 10 stories,

1310
01:04:17,671 --> 01:04:18,960
like how many stories are these 
buildings?

1311
01:04:18,961 --> 01:04:21,840
Most of them were two or three stories,
two or three stories.

1312
01:04:21,841 --> 01:04:24,660
And so you set up a perimeter around the
building.

1313
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:28,350
Key people stationed in them,
guns at the windows,

1314
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:30,710
looking out constantly.
And it would be it.

1315
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:35,960
We take the building down and then they 
would do a massive construction project 

1316
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:36,810
in the middle of a combat zone.

1317
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:40,320
So these army engineers,
God bless them all would roll down there

1318
01:04:40,321 --> 01:04:45,321
with their bulldozers and there they put
these big concrete barriers up and they 

1319
01:04:45,321 --> 01:04:48,300
put sand bags and all the windows and 
they build machine gun nests on top.

1320
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:51,090
And again,
they're doing this in the middle of like

1321
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:51,900
mayhem.
Wow.

1322
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:56,070
And then you'd have this secure combat 
outpost and while they were doing that,

1323
01:04:56,071 --> 01:05:01,071
this is sort of was our,
our addition to this type of operation 

1324
01:05:01,071 --> 01:05:03,810
was while they were doing this big 
construction progress project,

1325
01:05:03,811 --> 01:05:08,811
obviously the situation was very 
vulnerable for the American forces and 

1326
01:05:08,811 --> 01:05:12,921
so what we would do is I would push our 
seals out into perimeter buildings that 

1327
01:05:15,181 --> 01:05:20,181
were maybe 200 or 300 yards.
And so when the enemy would come to 

1328
01:05:20,181 --> 01:05:20,800
attack,
we'd kill them.

1329
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:26,640
What a crazy scene that must've been to 
be taking these buildings and then 

1330
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,390
reinforcing them and turning them into 
military bases.

1331
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:30,850
And then one after another.
You doing this to.

1332
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:31,690
Yeah.
Yeah,

1333
01:05:31,691 --> 01:05:32,920
it was,
it was an awesome effort.

1334
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:37,940
And I think a good number.
We put in one combat outposts and there 

1335
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:37,940
was the,
the uh,

1336
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:42,790
army engineers put in 30,000
sandbags in one combat outpost,

1337
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:45,340
like three buildings.
Just all good things.

1338
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:46,660
A lot of sand out there.
Yeah.

1339
01:05:46,730 --> 01:05:48,220
No,
no doubt about it.

1340
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:53,340
Wow.
And so how many buildings did you guys 

1341
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:53,340
wind up taking overall?
Uh,

1342
01:05:55,170 --> 01:05:58,170
probably probably a total of like 10 
combat outposts,

1343
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,630
each one having to three or four 
buildings.

1344
01:06:00,810 --> 01:06:02,940
And again,
let me clarify when I say we,

1345
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:06,690
I'm talking about this massive effort of
the one one aed,

1346
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:11,840
which is the First Brigade,
First Armored Division and all the 

1347
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:14,760
battalions that were underneath them,
including one Marine Corps Battalion.

1348
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:16,440
And the reason I'm pointing that out,
Joe,

1349
01:06:16,441 --> 01:06:21,310
is a,
those guys were just unbelievable years.

1350
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:23,470
They really were.
They were awesome.

1351
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:28,680
You choked up.
Yeah,

1352
01:06:28,681 --> 01:06:30,390
these guys were,
these guys were awesome.

1353
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:36,610
They really were.
Yeah.

1354
01:06:36,611 --> 01:06:40,300
I can only imagine the emotional 
attachment that you have to that.

1355
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,980
Yeah.
And you know,

1356
01:06:45,981 --> 01:06:46,480
they,
you know,

1357
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:49,640
you can look,
you can google navy seals and find,

1358
01:06:49,641 --> 01:06:50,560
you know,
$20,

1359
01:06:50,561 --> 01:06:53,530
million new stories about them.
Um,

1360
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:58,400
and that's great.
But these guys,

1361
01:06:58,730 --> 01:06:59,270
you know,
to,

1362
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:02,900
to have seen them,
uh,

1363
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:05,510
kids,
you know,

1364
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:06,480
because,
you know,

1365
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:09,490
you're talking about earlier how the 
seals,

1366
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:10,700
you know,
guys like me,

1367
01:07:10,701 --> 01:07:12,680
this is what we want to do.
Well,

1368
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:16,790
these guys didn't all necessarily have 
that attitude.

1369
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:22,000
And as a matter of fact,
the guys that were in Ramadi with us 

1370
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,601
when we first got there,
they were reserve unit out of 

1371
01:07:25,601 --> 01:07:26,810
Pennsylvania,
the two to eight iron soldiers.

1372
01:07:26,870 --> 01:07:28,940
They were reservists.
These guys were teachers that like,

1373
01:07:28,941 --> 01:07:31,400
like what you see when they talk about 
these reserves.

1374
01:07:31,401 --> 01:07:34,700
These guys were teachers and professors 
and you know,

1375
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:39,850
bakers and they had real jobs and real 
world and wanting to get home to their 

1376
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:43,031
family.
And yet they were there grinding it out 

1377
01:07:43,031 --> 01:07:43,031
against a hardened enemy.
And so,

1378
01:07:43,031 --> 01:07:43,730
uh,
yeah,

1379
01:07:43,731 --> 01:07:44,460
it's,
it's,

1380
01:07:44,490 --> 01:07:45,250
it's a,
it's a,

1381
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:50,330
it's a crazy thing to see and it's,
it's very humbling to be around people 

1382
01:07:51,081 --> 01:07:52,760
like that.
It really is.

1383
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:56,810
How long did this battle go on the 
battle for Ramada?

1384
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:00,460
Well,
we got there,

1385
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:00,910
you know,
the,

1386
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:05,940
like I said,
the two to eight had been there for 14 

1387
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:06,790
months.
Fourteen months on the ground.

1388
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:09,580
Last around 100 guys,
I think 94.

1389
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:15,300
Um,
and then the [inaudible] came in in May 

1390
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:21,190
and implemented c's clear hold and build
in by the time,

1391
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:23,570
uh,
when I left October 20,

1392
01:08:23,571 --> 01:08:26,570
first 2006.
And by the,

1393
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:30,380
by January of 2007,
the battle was for most,

1394
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:35,000
for the most part over and these enemy 
attacks that had been,

1395
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:37,130
uh,
when we were there,

1396
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:41,660
30 to 50 a day,
went down to like one a day and then one

1397
01:08:41,670 --> 01:08:45,330
week and then one a month and,
and,

1398
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:50,090
and you know,
I have pictures of probably about six to

1399
01:08:50,091 --> 01:08:55,091
nine months after we left,
we got pictures that guy sent back to 

1400
01:08:55,091 --> 01:08:57,410
us.
So they were running road races down the

1401
01:08:57,411 --> 01:08:59,210
worst.
What were the worst areas?

1402
01:08:59,211 --> 01:09:00,710
Ramadi,
they were playing soccer games.

1403
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:03,200
There was people out in the streets,
there was guys,

1404
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:06,770
seals or not seals,
but soldiers with no body armor on,

1405
01:09:06,771 --> 01:09:09,320
just walking around meeting people.
It was a,

1406
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:14,410
it was a miraculous turnaround and the 
people of Ramadi that we had fought to 

1407
01:09:14,410 --> 01:09:18,761
support and help or were joyous and 
we're had a stable city to live in and 

1408
01:09:19,791 --> 01:09:21,890
we're ready to carry on with their 
lives.

1409
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:27,220
See,
I think stories like this get left out 

1410
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:27,980
of the mainstream narrative.
Of course they do.

1411
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,560
The most people,
me included,

1412
01:09:30,561 --> 01:09:33,260
just don't know about it,
aren't aware of it.

1413
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:38,290
Have a very insulated idea of what this 
war was about,

1414
01:09:38,930 --> 01:09:43,930
what happened over there and what are 
the pros and cons of this war and what 

1415
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:48,611
are the pros and cons of taking a city 
like this and turning it into a 

1416
01:09:49,491 --> 01:09:52,280
relatively safe place.
Relatively.

1417
01:09:52,281 --> 01:09:53,450
It was definitely a safe place.

1418
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:55,610
There was less murders there.
The nerves and Detroit.

1419
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:56,970
Wow.
I mean it was,

1420
01:09:57,030 --> 01:09:59,810
it was a complete turnaround and again,
you do,

1421
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:03,800
you can do that because the people there
wanted to be stable.

1422
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:08,830
They wanted that.
They wanted peace and they wanted 

1423
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:08,830
freedom and they wanted the insurgents 
out.

1424
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:09,980
They absolutely wanted the insurgents 
out.

1425
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:13,790
Do you think that most people in America
have a distorted perception of,

1426
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:18,020
of the military in general and of the 
Iraq war in particular?

1427
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:24,460
I think it's hard for me to give a 
perspective of what civilians think,

1428
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:26,650
you know,
it's,

1429
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:28,880
it's very difficult because,
you know,

1430
01:10:28,881 --> 01:10:31,870
it's really easy to slip into like just 
a straight John j Rambo,

1431
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:33,710
you know,
there are no friendly civilians.

1432
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:36,380
It's really easy to get there.
Uh,

1433
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:41,540
but definitely when I hear various 
people talking and you go,

1434
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:45,510
this person has no idea,
this person has no idea the,

1435
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:48,950
it's weird because they'll clump the 
people of Iraq,

1436
01:10:48,951 --> 01:10:53,951
they'll clump those people together as a
group and it's the wrong.

1437
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,270
They have the wrong impression of what 
those people are like,

1438
01:10:56,330 --> 01:10:57,110
you know,
and,

1439
01:10:57,260 --> 01:11:02,260
and guys that have been to Iraq and have
gone into houses and talk to the local 

1440
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:05,000
populace there and broke bread with them
and drank their tea.

1441
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:06,380
You're like,
oh that these people,

1442
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:09,800
these people definitely wanted us there.
Like when I hear this thing about,

1443
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:14,830
you know,
that they didn't want us there and we 

1444
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:14,830
were occupying.
It's like,

1445
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:14,830
oh no,
they,

1446
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:19,120
there was,
there was times where the weed kill an 

1447
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:19,120
insurgent and they would cheer.
They would cheer.

1448
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,390
Like thank you,
thank you for killing that person.

1449
01:11:21,391 --> 01:11:23,340
He was a terrorist and he was,
you know,

1450
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:25,470
trying to,
trying to rape my daughter.

1451
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:27,480
They were happy we were there.

1452
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:32,820
What is Ramadi like now?
It's been overrun by Isis.

1453
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:37,880
There.
They keep saying now that there's going 

1454
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:41,080
to be an effort by the Iraqi military to
take it back and God blessed them and 

1455
01:11:41,551 --> 01:11:46,551
good luck.
They would have to do the exact same 

1456
01:11:46,551 --> 01:11:48,951
thing.
They're going to have to do the exact 

1457
01:11:48,951 --> 01:11:48,951
same thing.
It's gonna be it's gonna be tough.

1458
01:11:48,951 --> 01:11:52,380
It's going to be really tough and 
without the United States military force

1459
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:55,110
backing them up and leading something 
like that,

1460
01:11:55,111 --> 01:11:58,110
do you think that's even possible?
It's going to be difficult.

1461
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,110
It is possible,
but is absolutely going to be difficult.

1462
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:05,890
It's gonna be very difficult.
That's one of the things that again,

1463
01:12:05,891 --> 01:12:10,891
you know and leadership and leadership 
is such an important thing.

1464
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:18,300
It's such an important thing because it 
really does change.

1465
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:23,660
It changes every variable in a situation
and so when you have good leaders,

1466
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:31,880
you you can win and I don't know who in 
particular is in charge of this Iraqi 

1467
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:37,820
force that's going in there.
The Iraqis have some very strong 

1468
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:38,880
leadership and if they've got the right 
person in position,

1469
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:44,210
they will be able to take it back.
Now America has absolutely has 

1470
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:49,150
incredible military leaders,
some incredible military leaders,

1471
01:12:49,330 --> 01:12:54,330
and when you,
when you have to step up and lead of an 

1472
01:12:54,941 --> 01:12:58,240
assault like that on a city,
I mean American leadership would be,

1473
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:04,200
would absolutely make a change and would
be extremely positive for the situation 

1474
01:13:05,771 --> 01:13:08,050
on the ground.
Do you think that America should go back

1475
01:13:08,051 --> 01:13:08,680
into Iraq?

1476
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:13,870
Well,
first of all,

1477
01:13:13,871 --> 01:13:16,240
we're already back in Iraq were on the 
ground.

1478
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:17,770
We got 3,500
troops there.

1479
01:13:18,730 --> 01:13:23,730
This is a,
and I hate to answer your question with 

1480
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:27,841
a philosophical answer,
but war is very difficult and very 

1481
01:13:34,151 --> 01:13:39,151
tragic and very evil in its own right,
and so you should be very,

1482
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:48,420
very cautious about pulling that trigger
and initiating a war because horrible 

1483
01:13:53,401 --> 01:13:56,610
things are going to happen.
Horrible things are gonna happen.

1484
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,980
Enemy are going to be killed,
friendly are going to be killed.

1485
01:14:01,981 --> 01:14:05,400
Americans are gonna be killed.
Civilians are going to be killed.

1486
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:10,580
This idea that we're going to go into a,
a worn urban environment and we're not 

1487
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:14,661
going to kill any civilians.
No civilians are going to die and you 

1488
01:14:14,661 --> 01:14:17,230
have to understand that.
And I,

1489
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:20,290
I talk about this when people ask me 
this question,

1490
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:27,180
there is two types of will that you have
to have if you're going to go to war to 

1491
01:14:28,661 --> 01:14:33,661
types of will,
one is the will to kill people and like 

1492
01:14:35,231 --> 01:14:40,231
I said,
it's going to be enemy and you're going 

1493
01:14:40,231 --> 01:14:42,581
to focus as much as you can on killing 
the enemy in some civilians are going to

1494
01:14:43,281 --> 01:14:45,770
die there.
That is what is going to happen.

1495
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:49,820
And you have to understand that that is 
part of what you are getting into.

1496
01:14:50,990 --> 01:14:55,990
So you have to have,
you have to have the will to kill and

1497
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:04,040
you also have to have the will to die 
because Americans are going to die and 

1498
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:13,670
young men are going to come home in 
coffins and that's a horrible thing.

1499
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:25,450
And so if you're going to go to war,
you should be going to war

1500
01:15:29,270 --> 01:15:34,270
with a clear vision to win,
to win.

1501
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:42,850
And I think if we have the will and we 
have a plan on,

1502
01:15:45,230 --> 01:15:48,470
on winning,
then we should.

1503
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:54,400
We should execute that plan.
But if we're hesitant and if we don't 

1504
01:15:54,741 --> 01:15:59,741
have the will,
then we should stand by until we develop

1505
01:16:01,431 --> 01:16:04,520
that will and we can sit outside and we 
can shape and we can.

1506
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:06,710
We can try and shape events which we 
should.

1507
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:09,230
We should have a leadership role in the 
world.

1508
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:11,690
We should be looking out for American 
interests.

1509
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:15,140
I know that sounds like taboo language 
in this day and age,

1510
01:16:15,141 --> 01:16:20,141
but we're America and we should look out
for American interests around the world.

1511
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:25,580
That's what we should be doing.
And there's nothing wrong with that.

1512
01:16:25,730 --> 01:16:30,730
That's what other countries are doing.
They're looking out for their interests 

1513
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:34,360
and when,
when we're all looking out for our own 

1514
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,581
interests,
there's a balance and things can move 

1515
01:16:36,581 --> 01:16:39,851
forward.
So do you think right now with the 

1516
01:16:39,851 --> 01:16:42,020
limited amount of troops that are in 
Iraq,

1517
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:43,730
it's a,
you said 3,500

1518
01:16:43,731 --> 01:16:45,890
now at one.
What was it at the height?

1519
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:49,580
I don't know.
Over $100,000.

1520
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:51,820
I mean at the hightest,
probably even close to 200,000.

1521
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:57,550
What would it take to develop that will 
that you talk of?

1522
01:16:57,590 --> 01:17:02,590
Do you think that the United States 
needs to see some other Paris like 

1523
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:07,271
event?
I mean we already had September 11th,

1524
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:09,980
they killed 3000 of our

1525
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:13,100
people on our home soil.
Um,

1526
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:18,430
but that was 14 years ago and for a lot 
of people that might as well be another 

1527
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:18,430
world.
True,

1528
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:19,430
true.
Um,

1529
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:20,870
I,
I,

1530
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:26,780
I got to ask the other day about the 
warning signs,

1531
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,490
you know,
to do.

1532
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:33,600
Are we paying enough attention to the 
warning signs or are there enough 

1533
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:33,600
warning signs in it?
I just,

1534
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,210
I kind of shake my head.
I mean,

1535
01:17:35,211 --> 01:17:40,211
what more warning signs do you need?
Then go watch youtube videos and they're

1536
01:17:41,211 --> 01:17:43,490
like,
we are coming to kill you.

1537
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:46,870
We are going to destroy you all that.
What?

1538
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:49,850
That's the warning right there.
The warning has been issued.

1539
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:55,420
Standby for people like me that are 
completely on the outside of the 

1540
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:57,440
military.
It seems like isis came out of nowhere.

1541
01:17:57,770 --> 01:18:01,880
It seems like once Arab spring started 
happening,

1542
01:18:01,881 --> 01:18:06,881
we started pulling out of Iraq.
All of a sudden you started hearing 

1543
01:18:06,881 --> 01:18:10,271
about the isl or Isi or isis varies.

1544
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:14,060
They use the term Isi,
which was,

1545
01:18:14,061 --> 01:18:19,061
which was ice Islamic state Iraq.
They use that and I think 2007 was the 

1546
01:18:19,061 --> 01:18:23,321
first time they use that as they started
to take a area over in Syria.

1547
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:27,020
They threw the l on the end of it,
which is Lavonne,

1548
01:18:27,021 --> 01:18:31,640
which is the historical name for that,
that region and the other one is Syria.

1549
01:18:31,641 --> 01:18:36,641
The SS is so it's the same people.
It's the same people that were there and

1550
01:18:37,341 --> 01:18:39,020
will continue to be there until we route
them out.

1551
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:42,860
What the.
What I was getting at was that it wasn't

1552
01:18:42,861 --> 01:18:46,250
something that anybody here had heard 
about as an organized thing.

1553
01:18:46,251 --> 01:18:51,251
We had heard about insurgents in Iraq,
but we had never heard of it in in a 

1554
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:55,820
like with a name like like Isis.
Now that it's a name,

1555
01:18:55,821 --> 01:19:00,290
it's like an identifiable enemy and when
you're in a war against terrorism,

1556
01:19:00,291 --> 01:19:03,350
one of the things that I think kind of 
freaks Americans out,

1557
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:06,620
especially those that don't have a 
connection with the military,

1558
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:09,910
is this idea of a war against terrorism 
is,

1559
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,680
is this open ended proposition?

1560
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:14,420
There is no enemy,
you know,

1561
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:16,520
like the Er,
there's no,

1562
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:20,450
there's no definitive end to this.
Like when Japan surrendered,

1563
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:23,240
World War II was over,
people were kissing in the streets,

1564
01:19:23,241 --> 01:19:28,241
that iconic image of the sailor kissing 
his girlfriend in the street that we 

1565
01:19:29,061 --> 01:19:34,061
didn't,
none of that happened for us in this 

1566
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:37,511
country.
There was no definitive ending and when 

1567
01:19:37,511 --> 01:19:41,110
we've pulled out of Iraq and we're 
planning on pulling out of Afghanistan 

1568
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:45,010
and then we see isis build up and get 
bigger and stronger and scarier and we 

1569
01:19:45,010 --> 01:19:49,541
see what happened in Paris and we see 
what happened in Lebanon and in Nigeria 

1570
01:19:50,331 --> 01:19:52,850
and we see these terrorist attacks and 
we're like,

1571
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,950
well wait,
when is this?

1572
01:19:55,880 --> 01:20:00,880
Is there ever going to be a point where 
we have a soldier and his girlfriend 

1573
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,810
kissing in the street is they're going 
to be an end.

1574
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:06,410
Is there going to be a confetti 
billowing in the main street?

1575
01:20:06,411 --> 01:20:08,010
And a parade doesn't

1576
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:13,010
seem like it.
I would say that that's an accurate 

1577
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:13,010
assessment that it doesn't seem like it.

1578
01:20:13,970 --> 01:20:14,210
Yeah.

1579
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:16,540
We got a long fight,
you know,

1580
01:20:16,541 --> 01:20:18,820
and,
and you asked where did isis,

1581
01:20:18,850 --> 01:20:20,560
how do we start hearing about them?
Well,

1582
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,450
the same thing we were talking about 
earlier.

1583
01:20:22,510 --> 01:20:23,970
Social media.
Yeah.

1584
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:27,520
They've got social media.
They're aiming it at,

1585
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:32,790
you know,
a disenchanted people all around the 

1586
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:36,811
world that can cling onto something that
will give them some sort of a identity.

1587
01:20:39,490 --> 01:20:44,490
Yeah.
That's one of the most bizarre things 

1588
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:46,531
about this.
When you see people like these young 

1589
01:20:46,531 --> 01:20:47,770
girls from the UK joining Isis and you 
know,

1590
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:51,440
they're escaping their country and going
over there and joining isis.

1591
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:54,010
Like what,
what is happening here?

1592
01:20:54,011 --> 01:20:59,011
Like how disenchanted do you have to be 
where that looks attractive to you?

1593
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:04,480
The two girls,
I'm sure you saw this in the two poster 

1594
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:04,480
girls for Isis,
uh,

1595
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:08,820
one of them died three to six months ago
and they just got the latest report on 

1596
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:11,950
the other one that was trying to escape 
Isis and they beat her to death.

1597
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:17,100
Yeah.
Did me

1598
01:21:18,110 --> 01:21:22,220
unquestionably.
It seems to be a growing force in a more

1599
01:21:22,221 --> 01:21:25,730
dangerous force.
Every day I got,

1600
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:27,320
again,
I think it was on twitter,

1601
01:21:27,321 --> 01:21:29,480
someone hit me the other day on twitter,
um,

1602
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:34,430
you know,
this is an idea and you can't bomb ideas

1603
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:37,400
was the,
was the statement to me and you know,

1604
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:42,600
I try and avoid getting into these 
massive sort of political debates or 

1605
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:43,860
whatever,
um,

1606
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:49,360
especially with 140 characters.
And that being said,

1607
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:50,290
um,

1608
01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:57,210
Nazi-ism was an idea that was defeated 
through military force.

1609
01:21:57,610 --> 01:22:02,610
Slavery in America was an idea that was 
defeated by military force.

1610
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:07,920
Imperial Japan was an idea and to 
religion that was defeated by military 

1611
01:22:08,891 --> 01:22:13,891
force and none of those ideas would have
stopped without military force.

1612
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:20,020
And this is an idea that can be defeated
with bombs.

1613
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:25,470
And this is also an idea that 
unfortunately in this country gets 

1614
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:28,480
connected to all Muslims.
The idea behind what these people are do

1615
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:32,590
or doing gets connected to all Muslims.
When in reality,

1616
01:22:32,830 --> 01:22:37,830
most of the Muslims in the world,
they don't want something like isis to 

1617
01:22:37,830 --> 01:22:42,271
be in control.
They don't want to be in a perpetual 

1618
01:22:42,271 --> 01:22:44,881
state of war.
They don't want to have to worry about 

1619
01:22:44,881 --> 01:22:46,270
these quote unquote savages.
And what they're doing,

1620
01:22:46,810 --> 01:22:51,810
yeah,
I mean the isis has killed hundreds of 

1621
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:52,540
thousands of.
Well,

1622
01:22:52,541 --> 01:22:53,650
I dunno,
I dunno what the number is,

1623
01:22:53,651 --> 01:22:57,520
but we know that isis has killed 
thousands and thousands and thousands of

1624
01:22:57,521 --> 01:22:58,540
Muslims,
you know,

1625
01:22:58,541 --> 01:23:03,541
they went into Ramadi and killed 
hundreds and hundreds of Muslims that 

1626
01:23:03,541 --> 01:23:07,591
had worked in some way with the 
coalition forces that they could have a 

1627
01:23:07,591 --> 01:23:07,660
peaceful city.
They murdered them all.

1628
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:11,890
So let's say Donald Trump becomes 
president and uh,

1629
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:16,950
he listens to your podcast with Tim 
Ferriss and he read your book and he 

1630
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:16,950
goes,
Jocko,

1631
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:19,570
I'm coming to you for advice.
What do I do?

1632
01:23:19,690 --> 01:23:21,280
I don't know why I said Donald Trump for
president.

1633
01:23:21,281 --> 01:23:23,000
I'm hoping that that's our own isis.

1634
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:27,700
Let's whatever.
Fill in the blank.

1635
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:31,420
New President person becomes a known 
size head person.

1636
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:34,200
I didn't even go with woman or man.
Uh,

1637
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,610
what,
what would you do if you were,

1638
01:23:36,611 --> 01:23:41,611
if you were in a leadership position,
if you were in a position to make a 

1639
01:23:41,611 --> 01:23:43,440
decision or to,
uh,

1640
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:46,000
to start a process,
what would you do?

1641
01:23:46,450 --> 01:23:49,090
We would destroy them.
You would just go right back in.

1642
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:52,900
We would destroy them and you think that
that's what America should do right now?

1643
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:57,340
Yes.
Yes.

1644
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:03,120
It is a cancer that is growing.
It is malignant and it needs to be 

1645
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:06,370
destroyed.
So what steps would you take?

1646
01:24:06,371 --> 01:24:11,371
Like what?
What would you do if you were in a 

1647
01:24:11,371 --> 01:24:11,371
position of power right now?
You know,

1648
01:24:11,371 --> 01:24:15,840
it's interesting.
People get this idea that this is some 

1649
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:18,760
crazy complex situation and it's going 
to be all hard and all this.

1650
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:23,830
I could pull together like two first 
lieutenants from the Marine Corps,

1651
01:24:23,831 --> 01:24:26,680
which is like the junior officer in the 
marine corps and say come up with a plan

1652
01:24:26,681 --> 01:24:31,681
to defeat isis.
You got two hours and they do it and 

1653
01:24:31,681 --> 01:24:32,770
it'd be a good plan.
This is not a complex situation.

1654
01:24:32,950 --> 01:24:35,470
How many people you're dealing with when
you talking about Isis?

1655
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:38,970
I don't know.
Twenty thousand,

1656
01:24:39,130 --> 01:24:40,990
10,000?
4,000.

1657
01:24:41,170 --> 01:24:43,660
100,000
stuff to tell it.

1658
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:44,350
Yeah.
It's tough to tell.

1659
01:24:44,351 --> 01:24:45,760
It doesn't matter.
You assess it,

1660
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:48,880
you make you,
you bring what you need to the table and

1661
01:24:48,881 --> 01:24:53,881
you defeat them.
So what do you think is holding back 

1662
01:24:53,881 --> 01:24:54,070
from us doing something like,
I have no idea.

1663
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:56,860
Is it frustrating to you?
Yes.

1664
01:24:58,180 --> 01:25:03,180
Because if you got kids and you see the,
again,

1665
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:08,880
a malignant cancer on humanity that is 
growing unchecked when we have,

1666
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:14,470
we're,
we're like the master surgeons that have

1667
01:25:14,471 --> 01:25:19,471
the ability to go in and eradicate this 
disease and instead of doing that we're 

1668
01:25:19,471 --> 01:25:20,890
just,
we're just not doing anything.

1669
01:25:21,310 --> 01:25:25,210
So do you blame this,
the current administration?

1670
01:25:25,211 --> 01:25:30,010
Do you blame the,
the climate of the American public right

1671
01:25:30,011 --> 01:25:35,011
now?
The political climate where people just 

1672
01:25:35,011 --> 01:25:37,141
don't want to be involved in another war
or enter into another prolonged 

1673
01:25:37,141 --> 01:25:41,521
interaction?
I think people are always looking for 

1674
01:25:41,521 --> 01:25:44,560
the easiest way out and going in as a 
hard decision to make.

1675
01:25:45,310 --> 01:25:50,310
It's a very hard decision to make and 
it's be very unpopular decision and it 

1676
01:25:51,371 --> 01:25:55,000
would be the short term pain that 
everyone's afraid of.

1677
01:25:55,570 --> 01:26:00,570
That's what one of the things that's so 
disconcerting to me about drones because

1678
01:26:00,851 --> 01:26:03,980
it seems to me that what drones are is a
way

1679
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:08,980
that we can avoid American casualties so
people don't complain about it as much.

1680
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:14,380
So we send this robot in there to fly in
and then launch missiles and the good 

1681
01:26:14,511 --> 01:26:17,150
thing is it doesn't create American 
casualties,

1682
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:21,260
but the bad thing is it doesn't seem to 
be nearly as effective.

1683
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:26,620
It's sort of a wishy washy attempt in 
some ways at war it seems almost like it

1684
01:26:27,231 --> 01:26:30,950
would be something that would,
you would use in a supplement as,

1685
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:36,010
as well as a military attack.
Like they would be a part of it instead 

1686
01:26:36,010 --> 01:26:38,150
of being the only thing that you used to
try to combat these people.

1687
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:40,880
Does that make sense?
I don't know if we have enough drones to

1688
01:26:40,881 --> 01:26:45,881
get the job done and they're effective,
but I mean a drone is going to take out.

1689
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:47,600
I Dunno.
Twenty,

1690
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:50,960
20 bad guys.
So that'd be a lot of drones in action.

1691
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:53,030
I don't know if we have that kind of 
capability yet,

1692
01:26:54,140 --> 01:26:56,800
but we will someday.
You know,

1693
01:26:56,910 --> 01:27:01,910
someday we'll have a robot army and 
we'll be dealing with some terminator 

1694
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:01,910
type situation,
right?

1695
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:05,270
Yes.
But right now it's almost like a,

1696
01:27:05,290 --> 01:27:08,540
we need to get smacked.
Like something needs to happen before we

1697
01:27:08,541 --> 01:27:13,541
hit back and I can't,
I cannot in good conscience agree with 

1698
01:27:13,541 --> 01:27:13,730
you because I don't even want to say 
those words.

1699
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:14,710
Yeah.
You know,

1700
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:16,460
it's just a horrible thing.
You don't want to put it out.

1701
01:27:16,461 --> 01:27:17,990
It's a horrible thought.
Yeah.

1702
01:27:18,350 --> 01:27:23,350
It's a horrible thought.
Especially when you start talking about 

1703
01:27:23,350 --> 01:27:24,560
a dirty bomb,
you know,

1704
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:25,340
and like,
Oh,

1705
01:27:25,341 --> 01:27:30,341
here's a sector of America that no one 
can live in anymore because it's been 

1706
01:27:30,711 --> 01:27:34,340
contaminated.
It's radioactive now mean.

1707
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:37,700
That's real.
And again,

1708
01:27:37,701 --> 01:27:41,210
for some reason the warning signs which 
can be seen,

1709
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:43,790
you know,
anywhere you look,

1710
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,290
we're ignoring them.

1711
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:50,890
I think people mean speaking for myself 
and speaking for the people that I come 

1712
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:55,151
in contact with,
I think people are becoming more and 

1713
01:27:55,151 --> 01:27:55,430
more concerned about isis on a pretty 
much daily basis.

1714
01:27:55,820 --> 01:28:00,820
I think one thing that Paris did do is 
it woke a lot of people up as two 

1715
01:28:00,820 --> 01:28:04,631
possibilities that something like this 
can happen and that this isn't the end 

1716
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:09,720
and this is,
this is ramping up and if they have the 

1717
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:10,160
kind of resources to pull off something 
like the Paris attacks,

1718
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:14,210
who knows where this is going.
Totally agree with you.

1719
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:19,500
It is a very scary time.
What do you think is going to happen if 

1720
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:24,161
you had to guess,
what do I think is going to happen in 

1721
01:28:24,161 --> 01:28:25,400
terms of the terrorist attack in 
America?

1722
01:28:25,401 --> 01:28:25,820
No,
no.

1723
01:28:25,821 --> 01:28:29,960
In terms of our approach to dealing with
something like Isis.

1724
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:39,100
Yeah.
I think it's very difficult to predict 

1725
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:40,901
the future,
but not not to be just a big cop out 

1726
01:28:40,901 --> 01:28:42,050
over here.
I'm not trying to do that to you,

1727
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:47,210
but there's so many different ways that 
this could go and you know,

1728
01:28:47,211 --> 01:28:52,211
now you've thrown Russia into the mix 
because they took down the Russian 

1729
01:28:52,211 --> 01:28:56,111
airline.
You've got a guy like Putin who is a 

1730
01:28:56,111 --> 01:28:56,111
gangster.
You know,

1731
01:28:56,111 --> 01:29:00,260
and I say that in both contexts of have 
negative and positive.

1732
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:00,950
I mean,
the guy

1733
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:03,990
in a negative way,
he's a gangster that's,

1734
01:29:04,410 --> 01:29:09,150
that's like scary with his thought 
process and at the same time like props,

1735
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:14,210
the guy's a gangster and he's going to 
smash them people you've got now,

1736
01:29:14,590 --> 01:29:15,930
Turkey in the mix.
I mean,

1737
01:29:15,931 --> 01:29:20,931
it's just a very,
it's a complex situation that's getting 

1738
01:29:20,931 --> 01:29:24,441
more complex all the time.
And the scariest part about it is that 

1739
01:29:25,950 --> 01:29:30,950
America is not in a leadership position.
We are not influencing the world the way

1740
01:29:31,681 --> 01:29:33,450
we once did.
We are not.

1741
01:29:33,810 --> 01:29:38,810
People are not looking to us as the,
as the leaders there were in the 

1742
01:29:39,910 --> 01:29:41,700
backseat.
And that's scary.

1743
01:29:41,701 --> 01:29:45,000
We should be in a leadership position.
There's nothing wrong with that.

1744
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:50,220
Is Not bad to have a benevolent country 
and,

1745
01:29:51,431 --> 01:29:54,190
and I know people are going to go crazy.
But uh,

1746
01:29:54,330 --> 01:29:59,330
uh,
generally benevolent country that's 

1747
01:29:59,330 --> 01:29:59,330
sitting here,
you know,

1748
01:29:59,330 --> 01:30:00,960
given billions of dollars of aid around 
the world,

1749
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,210
never taken any soil and kept it.

1750
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:03,660
I mean,
we've,

1751
01:30:03,950 --> 01:30:08,950
you know,
I guess in modern times we've never 

1752
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:10,500
taken any soil and kept it.
We've given Germany back to Jeremy.

1753
01:30:10,501 --> 01:30:12,120
We gave Japan back to Japan.
You know,

1754
01:30:12,121 --> 01:30:13,110
we've,
we've,

1755
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:17,370
we're,
we're a fairly benevolent country.

1756
01:30:17,371 --> 01:30:18,810
Again,
I know we've got faults,

1757
01:30:18,811 --> 01:30:20,250
I know we've done things wrong in the 
past.

1758
01:30:20,251 --> 01:30:21,720
I'm sure we'll do things wrong in the 
future,

1759
01:30:22,530 --> 01:30:27,530
but to have us not in a leadership 
position is a very disturbing time.

1760
01:30:30,540 --> 01:30:32,490
And when you say that we're not in a 
leadership position,

1761
01:30:32,530 --> 01:30:35,370
what do you think the shift is and where
do you think had happened?

1762
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:40,700
I think it's been happening and I think,
you know,

1763
01:30:40,730 --> 01:30:43,160
I think the current administration is 
definitely not,

1764
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:48,230
um,
as experienced as you would hope and I 

1765
01:30:48,230 --> 01:30:52,001
think there's a lot of,
a lot of naive attitudes about what the 

1766
01:30:52,001 --> 01:30:55,241
rest of the world is like.
So this administration you think was the

1767
01:30:55,681 --> 01:30:59,310
beginning of the shift away from America
being in a leadership position?

1768
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,080
Yes.
What do you,

1769
01:31:01,110 --> 01:31:03,360
what kind of a president do you think 
would change that?

1770
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:10,760
Somebody that has a better understanding
of the nature of the world,

1771
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:14,040
like a John McCain type guy?
Yeah.

1772
01:31:14,041 --> 01:31:14,970
Maybe like a,
like,

1773
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,260
like,
you know,

1774
01:31:16,350 --> 01:31:21,350
again,
I'm not going to sit here and try and 

1775
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:21,750
think of who the best presidential 
candidate would be.

1776
01:31:21,751 --> 01:31:23,920
I mean,
we have a hard time figuring that out in

1777
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:25,890
America as a whole,
but again,

1778
01:31:25,891 --> 01:31:30,891
you look at a guy like,
you look at a guy like Putin and you 

1779
01:31:30,891 --> 01:31:32,960
look at a guy like Obama.
Putin's

1780
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:37,980
whole existence has been geared towards 
this,

1781
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:40,110
you know what I mean?
A KGB guy.

1782
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:45,440
I mean,
he's been a player on the world stage 

1783
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:47,931
and a part of it for his whole life and 
he's got an acute understanding of it 

1784
01:31:47,931 --> 01:31:49,080
and he's a black belt,
you know,

1785
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:53,400
he's a legit black belt and you just see
these other,

1786
01:31:53,401 --> 01:31:55,310
um,
uh,

1787
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:57,780
you see the,
the naivete of,

1788
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:59,400
of this administration.

1789
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:00,880
And it's,
it's,

1790
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:03,520
it's really hard to.
It's hard to understand.

1791
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:08,700
It was one thing that Obama said it was 
yesterday or today that just drove me 

1792
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:13,231
crazy.
He was talking about the attack on 

1793
01:32:13,231 --> 01:32:14,230
planned parenthood in Colorado Springs 
and he said things like,

1794
01:32:14,231 --> 01:32:16,510
this don't happen in other countries.
It's like,

1795
01:32:16,540 --> 01:32:20,920
how the fuck do you say that?
Just days after what happened in Paris,

1796
01:32:20,921 --> 01:32:23,980
I was reading that just today before we 
started the podcast.

1797
01:32:23,981 --> 01:32:25,330
I was reading it.
I was like,

1798
01:32:25,331 --> 01:32:30,331
that is one of the craziest things that 
someone could say after hundreds of 

1799
01:32:30,331 --> 01:32:34,321
people were killed in Paris because he's
talking about it in terms of gun 

1800
01:32:34,321 --> 01:32:38,191
violence from a religious perspective 
that what the fuck happened in Paris?

1801
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:41,490
What it.
Because it's not about babies.

1802
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:42,660
It's different.
Like.

1803
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:43,890
Yeah,
and he,

1804
01:32:43,891 --> 01:32:48,891
I mean,
he said something the other day too was 

1805
01:32:48,891 --> 01:32:51,680
I'm not interested in some notion of 
America leading and winning.

1806
01:32:53,670 --> 01:32:56,370
What does that mean exactly?
That's.

1807
01:32:56,610 --> 01:32:57,390
Yeah,
it's very,

1808
01:32:57,391 --> 01:32:57,670
uh,

1809
01:32:59,550 --> 01:33:00,300
it's just,

1810
01:33:00,770 --> 01:33:01,430
it's an,
it's,

1811
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:03,930
it's very disturbing.
What does that mean?

1812
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:10,200
What did anybody ask him to qualify that
or knows one of bands kind of speaking?

1813
01:33:11,830 --> 01:33:12,130
Yeah,

1814
01:33:14,050 --> 01:33:19,050
that's a weird statement for the guy 
who's the commander and chief of the 

1815
01:33:19,050 --> 01:33:21,220
greatest army the world has ever known,
interested in staying,

1816
01:33:21,221 --> 01:33:25,780
number one.
I think the,

1817
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:28,360
the,
the concept of a benevolent leader,

1818
01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:31,000
the of a benevolent nation,
you know,

1819
01:33:31,420 --> 01:33:34,090
if you,
if you do concede that the world,

1820
01:33:34,091 --> 01:33:39,091
we're always being chaos and there will 
always be at least in terms of like 

1821
01:33:39,091 --> 01:33:39,730
foreseeable future,
you know,

1822
01:33:39,731 --> 01:33:41,440
the next one,
hundred years or whatever we're,

1823
01:33:41,490 --> 01:33:46,490
we're in until something crazy happens.
I mean it would have to be something 

1824
01:33:46,490 --> 01:33:50,970
monumental life changing that,
that stops conflict all around the 

1825
01:33:50,970 --> 01:33:51,310
world.
You'd have to,

1826
01:33:51,370 --> 01:33:56,370
if you were rational,
pragmatic person and you're looking at 

1827
01:33:56,370 --> 01:33:56,370
the future,
you'd have to say,

1828
01:33:56,370 --> 01:33:56,500
well,
we're going to have conflict.

1829
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:01,800
Especially if you look at places like 
the Congo or parts of the Middle East 

1830
01:34:02,561 --> 01:34:07,561
where people don't count and there's 
places where like you would have to 

1831
01:34:07,561 --> 01:34:10,951
educate them to the point where the 
future would look radically different 

1832
01:34:11,141 --> 01:34:11,740
than the present.

1833
01:34:11,770 --> 01:34:14,590
Right?
So if that's the case,

1834
01:34:14,620 --> 01:34:18,360
if,
if conflict will be something that we're

1835
01:34:18,380 --> 01:34:19,960
going to have to mitigate,
no matter what,

1836
01:34:20,650 --> 01:34:23,140
wouldn't you want to be the one that 
gets to decide?

1837
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:26,350
Wouldn't you want to be the person in a 
position of power?

1838
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,750
Yes.
You would be.

1839
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:32,960
It's like the is a much smaller scale,
but this is what I've always tried to 

1840
01:34:33,070 --> 01:34:38,070
tell people when they say,
why would you want to learn martial 

1841
01:34:38,070 --> 01:34:40,531
arts?
And what I always say is you don't want 

1842
01:34:40,531 --> 01:34:41,140
to learn martial arts because you want 
to go beat somebody up.

1843
01:34:41,410 --> 01:34:43,090
You want to learn martial arts for two 
things,

1844
01:34:43,091 --> 01:34:48,091
one,
because you want to learn how to 

1845
01:34:48,091 --> 01:34:50,191
overcome incredibly difficult things,
and in martial arts you're going to 

1846
01:34:50,651 --> 01:34:52,540
encountered times where you want to 
quit.

1847
01:34:52,541 --> 01:34:57,541
You're gonna get your ass kicked.
It's going to be difficult and it's 

1848
01:34:57,541 --> 01:34:58,250
extremely difficult to get good at it 
too.

1849
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:03,700
If you do get into a situation,
you want to be the one who gets to 

1850
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:08,141
choose whether or not someone gets hurt.
You don't want to be helpless because 

1851
01:35:08,141 --> 01:35:09,890
being helpless is a terrible place to 
be,

1852
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:15,520
but it doesn't necessarily mean that 
you're going to go out and fuck people 

1853
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:18,251
up and that's sort of the same idea on a
macro scale that you would look at the 

1854
01:35:19,281 --> 01:35:23,990
concept of America being a benevolent 
entity or benevolent superpower.

1855
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:26,240
Absolutely.
One hundred percent,

1856
01:35:26,241 --> 01:35:26,800
right?
You know,

1857
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:27,180
I mean,

1858
01:35:30,150 --> 01:35:30,870
you know,
it's,

1859
01:35:30,871 --> 01:35:33,930
it goes with everything that we do and 
when I say we,

1860
01:35:33,931 --> 01:35:34,710
I'm talking about you,
you know,

1861
01:35:34,711 --> 01:35:36,210
you train,
you work out,

1862
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:38,310
you try to be strong,
you know,

1863
01:35:38,311 --> 01:35:40,500
you keep yourself aware of what's 
happening.

1864
01:35:40,501 --> 01:35:43,220
It's not because you want to go around 
kicking people's asses,

1865
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:46,170
it's because you don't want to have to 
kick everyone's ass.

1866
01:35:46,171 --> 01:35:51,171
You know,
people are not looking at Joe Rogan be 

1867
01:35:51,171 --> 01:35:51,171
like,
Oh,

1868
01:35:51,171 --> 01:35:51,171
I'm going to beat him up right now.
Now they're going out of that guy.

1869
01:35:51,171 --> 01:35:52,620
I know he trains all the time and if 
someone gets in your face,

1870
01:35:52,621 --> 01:35:55,830
they're going to know that immediately.
You know that when you can tell,

1871
01:35:55,890 --> 01:35:59,280
you can tell by the way someone carries 
themselves what,

1872
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:01,980
you know,
what they have and what they know,

1873
01:36:01,981 --> 01:36:03,090
what they understand.
Uh,

1874
01:36:03,140 --> 01:36:04,620
you know,
I got asked the other day,

1875
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:06,330
if you were president,
you know,

1876
01:36:06,331 --> 01:36:08,850
you asked me if I was got advice.
They said if you were president,

1877
01:36:09,870 --> 01:36:13,470
what would you do with Isis?
And I said if I was president,

1878
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:17,750
Isis would not exist.
President Jocko happen.

1879
01:36:17,850 --> 01:36:19,680
They would not exist because

1880
01:36:21,070 --> 01:36:26,070
we would have a presence in the world 
that would prevent the growth of this 

1881
01:36:26,291 --> 01:36:30,370
kind of ideology,
but what kind of a reaction do you think

1882
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:34,990
you would have from the American public?
From the insulated American public?

1883
01:36:35,260 --> 01:36:35,800
I mean,
we're with,

1884
01:36:35,890 --> 01:36:40,890
this is probably one of the most 
sensitive times ever in terms of they 

1885
01:36:40,890 --> 01:36:44,730
throw around the term Islamophobia.
If you even criticize anyone that just 

1886
01:36:44,730 --> 01:36:46,080
happens to be Muslim.
I mean we're.

1887
01:36:46,081 --> 01:36:50,290
We're in a strange time when it comes to
incredibly sensitive,

1888
01:36:50,291 --> 01:36:55,291
maybe hypersensitive people that maybe 
don't have a good grip on reality.

1889
01:36:57,130 --> 01:36:59,080
Well,
what would you do?

1890
01:36:59,140 --> 01:37:00,910
Take them over there and buses.
Yeah,

1891
01:37:00,911 --> 01:37:01,930
that'd be one thing.
That'd be the way.

1892
01:37:02,490 --> 01:37:07,360
It's interesting because I've already 
talked about this

1893
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:14,320
Islamophobia.
I mean I fought alongside these Muslims.

1894
01:37:16,050 --> 01:37:21,050
I fought alongside them to help them.
My friends did and America did.

1895
01:37:22,710 --> 01:37:27,710
We fought alongside these people to try 
and help them and we did.

1896
01:37:28,830 --> 01:37:33,830
So how that gets twisted in some world 
to where you know,

1897
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:35,010
we're,
we're not,

1898
01:37:35,490 --> 01:37:38,250
we're,
we're evil is completely beyond me.

1899
01:37:38,570 --> 01:37:43,570
Well,
I think because there is legit 

1900
01:37:43,570 --> 01:37:43,570
Islamophobia out there in the world,
just like there's a.

1901
01:37:43,570 --> 01:37:48,000
there's a legit hatred of Christians.
There's legit hatred of Mormons.

1902
01:37:48,210 --> 01:37:53,210
I mean,
you're going to find groups of people 

1903
01:37:53,210 --> 01:37:53,870
that are hated and there's also people 
that aren't willing to look deeper,

1904
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:59,120
deeper into some some global issue.
If you have a global issue that there's 

1905
01:38:00,270 --> 01:38:05,270
these people that call themselves isis 
or al or whatever they call themselves 

1906
01:38:05,270 --> 01:38:07,590
and you know,
they call themselves the Islamic state.

1907
01:38:07,591 --> 01:38:08,860
You Owe Islam.
Oh,

1908
01:38:08,870 --> 01:38:10,830
Islams bad.
Muslims are bad.

1909
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:12,780
Muslims are evil.
I was watching some thing.

1910
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:16,260
There was A.
Sam Harris had posted up on twitter.

1911
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:20,640
There was this guy who is,
I believe it was in Virginia.

1912
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:25,880
He was a at a like county,
one of those meetings where you're 

1913
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:30,060
talking about building something in the 
town and he was.

1914
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:35,480
He was talking about putting up a mosque
and these people were screaming at him 

1915
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:40,041
that Muslims are evil and you're evil.
Cult is not going to come into our town 

1916
01:38:40,041 --> 01:38:42,710
and you're trying to invade our town and
get out of here with your evil called.

1917
01:38:43,190 --> 01:38:44,040
I'm like,
okay.

1918
01:38:44,041 --> 01:38:46,170
That's Islamophobia.
That's right there.

1919
01:38:46,171 --> 01:38:51,171
I mean,
you're talking about a peaceful guy who 

1920
01:38:51,171 --> 01:38:51,340
just wants to be able to worship his,
you know,

1921
01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:54,540
his ideas,
his religion in peace in this place.

1922
01:38:54,541 --> 01:38:56,720
He wants to build a mosque and people 
want to,

1923
01:38:56,790 --> 01:38:58,830
you know,
they're furious at this guy.

1924
01:38:59,130 --> 01:39:01,080
That's real Islamophobia.
Right.

1925
01:39:01,350 --> 01:39:06,350
But there's a big difference between 
something like that and what's going on 

1926
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:08,850
in other parts of the world with Isis.
A giant,

1927
01:39:08,851 --> 01:39:13,851
giant difference.
And I think that when people want to 

1928
01:39:13,851 --> 01:39:18,681
throw around that term Islamophobia,
I think a lot of times what they're 

1929
01:39:18,681 --> 01:39:20,100
doing is they're just trying to be 
correct.

1930
01:39:20,130 --> 01:39:23,170
They're trying to be politically correct
socially correct,

1931
01:39:23,171 --> 01:39:28,171
that trying to be sensitive and they're 
trying to let everybody know that 

1932
01:39:28,171 --> 01:39:28,510
they're not racist,
xenophobic,

1933
01:39:29,310 --> 01:39:34,310
Islamophobic or whatever,
that they're open minded and 

1934
01:39:34,310 --> 01:39:37,131
progressive.
So they're throwing around these terms 

1935
01:39:37,131 --> 01:39:37,131
and it kind of clouds the water.

1936
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:43,880
Okay.
I mean these are the,

1937
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:49,530
these people are running around calling,
you know,

1938
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:51,390
Islamophobia.
I don't know.

1939
01:39:51,391 --> 01:39:55,350
No one's ever called me that.
Not yet.

1940
01:39:55,950 --> 01:39:57,960
I'm sure they will get already today on 
twitter.

1941
01:39:58,290 --> 01:40:00,360
Yeah.
I don't see them happening right now.

1942
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:01,650
I don't,
I don't see how he could,

1943
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:03,270
I don't see how they could do that.
You know,

1944
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:04,950
again,
we,

1945
01:40:05,010 --> 01:40:09,120
we fought alongside Muslim people,
we ate with them,

1946
01:40:09,390 --> 01:40:11,880
we put our lives in their hands and they
put their hand,

1947
01:40:11,940 --> 01:40:16,940
their lives in our hands and you know,
America and my friends were killed 

1948
01:40:18,121 --> 01:40:23,121
trying to help them.
So how I'm a person that could be called

1949
01:40:23,611 --> 01:40:26,640
an Islamophobia is,
is kind of a stretch I think.

1950
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:28,250
Yeah.
Well it rationally,

1951
01:40:28,251 --> 01:40:31,010
but you're talking about people that 
aren't necessarily rational.

1952
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:32,670
Well,
you know,

1953
01:40:32,671 --> 01:40:37,671
people paint their own layers onto 
things and make them into what they're 

1954
01:40:37,671 --> 01:40:37,740
not.

1955
01:40:38,130 --> 01:40:40,020
Well,
I think it's symptomatic of what's going

1956
01:40:40,021 --> 01:40:42,150
on with,
with our culture too,

1957
01:40:42,151 --> 01:40:47,151
is that this,
these hypersensitive oversimplistic 

1958
01:40:47,190 --> 01:40:52,190
ideas and,
and people that that would say these 

1959
01:40:52,190 --> 01:40:55,581
things like this don't have a real grip 
like you have of what it's like over 

1960
01:40:57,881 --> 01:41:02,881
there and I don't think anybody does 
other than people like you that have 

1961
01:41:02,881 --> 01:41:05,620
been over there and had been in combat.
I don't think it's possible.

1962
01:41:06,010 --> 01:41:08,140
I think that's one of the problems that 
we have.

1963
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:13,160
We're behaving like children and a lot 
of ways because we really have never had

1964
01:41:13,841 --> 01:41:14,970
to live on our own.
Yeah.

1965
01:41:15,010 --> 01:41:15,570
And it's,
it's,

1966
01:41:15,690 --> 01:41:20,690
it's actually very similar to what we 
were talking about earlier with the 

1967
01:41:20,690 --> 01:41:24,600
traditional martial arts where you can 
sit there in your fantasy world and 

1968
01:41:25,181 --> 01:41:30,181
think that your ci is going to protect 
you and that as long as you spread love,

1969
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:35,760
you're going to be protected because 
your ci is strong and until you've been 

1970
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:37,600
in a fistfight,
you're gonna believe that.

1971
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:39,430
And so that,
that's Kinda like what you're saying.

1972
01:41:39,431 --> 01:41:44,431
Do we need to get spanked or do we need 
to get into a fistfight before America 

1973
01:41:44,431 --> 01:41:44,431
realizes like,
oh no,

1974
01:41:44,431 --> 01:41:45,160
there's real problems in the world that 
need to be handled.

1975
01:41:45,890 --> 01:41:49,570
This is one of the weirdest times 
everybody have been in my act about,

1976
01:41:49,571 --> 01:41:54,571
um,
this is the first time ever where 

1977
01:41:54,571 --> 01:41:55,720
someone broke into the White House or if
you know that in 2014 was the first time

1978
01:41:55,721 --> 01:41:57,910
anybody had gained access and there was 
a woman guardian,

1979
01:41:57,911 --> 01:42:02,911
front door was unarmed woman caught in 
the front door and a woman who's in 

1980
01:42:02,911 --> 01:42:06,481
charge of secret service because 
diversity and one of my favorite parts 

1981
01:42:06,791 --> 01:42:11,791
was,
there was an article written about when 

1982
01:42:11,791 --> 01:42:13,651
the guy knocked the chick over,
ran inside and they said it was reviewed

1983
01:42:14,321 --> 01:42:16,910
and gender wasn't an issue.
Well,

1984
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:18,010
we're okay.
Yeah,

1985
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:18,970
that makes lot of sense.

1986
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:22,120
Like Brock Lesnar was guarding the door.
The same thing would've happened.

1987
01:42:22,121 --> 01:42:24,600
The guy would've knocked him over and he
would have.

1988
01:42:24,910 --> 01:42:29,910
No one would have ever caught the guy 
you just want to ran by and that's 

1989
01:42:29,910 --> 01:42:33,301
fucking ridiculous.
But it's that same kind of crazy 

1990
01:42:33,301 --> 01:42:34,660
thinking politically correct,
asinine thinking.

1991
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:39,900
You should have a fucking team if you're
going to make the president sleep in a 

1992
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:43,501
house that's in the park,
should probably have a team of fucking 

1993
01:42:43,501 --> 01:42:46,561
assassins surrounding that building at 
all times and you should keep a lookout 

1994
01:42:46,561 --> 01:42:48,250
for dudes that are sprinting across the 
lawn,

1995
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:50,440
knocking over chicks that are guardian 
the front door.

1996
01:42:51,250 --> 01:42:53,380
There's no doubt about it,
but it's the same thing.

1997
01:42:53,410 --> 01:42:58,410
It's like we're so soft and we're so 
used to being in this insulated world 

1998
01:42:58,661 --> 01:43:03,661
that we have here,
this nice sweet bubble where we drive 

1999
01:43:03,661 --> 01:43:05,110
our eight mile per hour or eight mile 
per gallon suv.

2000
01:43:06,670 --> 01:43:11,670
I don't know how you would ever really 
illuminates all these problems that 

2001
01:43:12,671 --> 01:43:16,090
you're bringing up.
I don't know how you get get these.

2002
01:43:16,270 --> 01:43:18,010
I mean to the hand of the average 
citizen,

2003
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:22,210
like in World War II that you and me,
if we were 13 years old,

2004
01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:25,330
we weren't old enough to serve.
We still knew that there was a war going

2005
01:43:25,331 --> 01:43:29,050
on because we couldn't eat steak.
We couldn't use any metal.

2006
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:34,200
We were gardening at night.
We were shutting off the lights like we 

2007
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:37,021
were impacted.
All of America was impacted at the 

2008
01:43:37,021 --> 01:43:37,870
height of the battle of Ramadi,
the height of it,

2009
01:43:37,871 --> 01:43:41,020
at the height of the war of Iraq at the 
height of the war of Afghanistan,

2010
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:44,200
America,
Americans at the mall.

2011
01:43:44,260 --> 01:43:47,440
We're not impacted at all at all,
at all.

2012
01:43:47,830 --> 01:43:52,830
Not only that,
they weren't even allowed to show 

2013
01:43:52,830 --> 01:43:52,830
photographs of coffins,

2014
01:43:52,830 --> 01:43:55,730
so the first time ever in the history of
the United States,

2015
01:43:55,731 --> 01:44:00,320
a history of the United States taking 
pictures during war time where they made

2016
01:44:00,321 --> 01:44:05,321
it illegal to show photos of coffins,
which is just absolutely insane.

2017
01:44:06,830 --> 01:44:07,730
Like,
how,

2018
01:44:08,210 --> 01:44:12,920
how are you going to let people 
understand what's happening if you don't

2019
01:44:12,921 --> 01:44:16,700
even allow journalists to show 
photographs of coffins?

2020
01:44:18,660 --> 01:44:20,000
It's the,
it's the bubble.

2021
01:44:20,090 --> 01:44:25,090
You're talking about the same situation.
What made you decide to leave the 

2022
01:44:25,090 --> 01:44:29,741
military?
Well,

2023
01:44:30,740 --> 01:44:32,150
a bunch of things.
I mean,

2024
01:44:32,151 --> 01:44:34,130
it wasn't like one day I woke up and 
said,

2025
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:34,760
all right,
I'm done.

2026
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:35,960
Uh,
you know,

2027
01:44:35,961 --> 01:44:40,961
obviously if,
if you haven't caught this up to this 

2028
01:44:40,961 --> 01:44:40,961
point,
I loved.

2029
01:44:40,961 --> 01:44:41,600
I loved the seal teams.
Yeah.

2030
01:44:41,601 --> 01:44:45,740
I loved being in the military.
I'm at the 20 year mark.

2031
01:44:45,860 --> 01:44:50,860
I had a bunch of different things that 
kind of weighed in,

2032
01:44:51,021 --> 01:44:56,021
you know,
I had a family that I hadn't seen or 

2033
01:44:56,021 --> 01:44:57,860
didn't know pretty much.
So you start thinking,

2034
01:44:57,861 --> 01:44:58,670
well,
you know,

2035
01:44:58,990 --> 01:45:00,950
maybe I should pay attention to them a 
little bit.

2036
01:45:01,790 --> 01:45:06,790
I had completed sort of my last real job
operational job in the seal teams and it

2037
01:45:09,621 --> 01:45:12,380
was going to be a long time before I was
in command again,

2038
01:45:12,410 --> 01:45:17,410
have a seal team or have something that 
was important and from a war fighting 

2039
01:45:17,410 --> 01:45:22,181
perspective.
So that was kind of kind of another 

2040
01:45:22,181 --> 01:45:22,181
thing that I looked at that was tough.
And,

2041
01:45:22,220 --> 01:45:26,240
and yeah,
I just,

2042
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:28,430
I guess I,
that's it.

2043
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:29,420
That's it really.

2044
01:45:31,970 --> 01:45:36,970
So what was your transition?
How long ago did you begin to get out?

2045
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:39,590
I got out in 2010.
Wow.

2046
01:45:39,591 --> 01:45:41,630
So this is five years ago.
Five years.

2047
01:45:41,690 --> 01:45:43,960
Yep.
And what was your transition was?

2048
01:45:44,750 --> 01:45:49,750
We uh,
started this company where we go and 

2049
01:45:49,750 --> 01:45:53,180
work with civilian companies doing 
leadership and management and you know,

2050
01:45:53,181 --> 01:45:58,181
my,
my buddy life that I was talking about 

2051
01:45:58,181 --> 01:45:59,501
earlier,
who was one of the platoon commanders 

2052
01:45:59,501 --> 01:45:59,501
that was with me and Ramadi and you 
know,

2053
01:45:59,501 --> 01:46:02,180
he,
he had run into a company I had run into

2054
01:46:02,181 --> 01:46:05,720
a company and they asked us to do some 
stuff and the next thing you know,

2055
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:07,150
you know,
I gave one,

2056
01:46:07,220 --> 01:46:10,000
one kind of leadership training to 
accompany and then they said,

2057
01:46:10,010 --> 01:46:11,870
come back and train all of our 
divisions.

2058
01:46:11,871 --> 01:46:15,320
And then the parent company of that 
company watched me and said,

2059
01:46:15,321 --> 01:46:17,810
hey,
can you come to our CEO Summit?

2060
01:46:17,810 --> 01:46:20,750
And then went to the CEO Summit and then
a bunch of those ceos said,

2061
01:46:20,751 --> 01:46:21,230
Hey,
can you come?

2062
01:46:21,231 --> 01:46:22,700
And then the next thing you know,
I'm doing this.

2063
01:46:22,910 --> 01:46:25,730
So what is the,
what is the process like when you're,

2064
01:46:25,731 --> 01:46:27,100
when you're doing these,
uh,

2065
01:46:27,140 --> 01:46:28,970
these speeches are,
you're setting things up,

2066
01:46:28,971 --> 01:46:33,971
how do you organize them and what you,
you obviously your lifetime was in the 

2067
01:46:33,971 --> 01:46:34,540
military,
right?

2068
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:39,700
So what was it about you and about what 
you brought to the table that was so 

2069
01:46:39,891 --> 01:46:44,891
attractive to them?
I think it's because the principles of 

2070
01:46:44,891 --> 01:46:48,671
leadership and that's where we,
that's what we talk about and that's 

2071
01:46:48,671 --> 01:46:49,800
what we teach is leadership.
The principals leadership do change

2072
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:54,980
whether you're,
whether your mission is to capture kill 

2073
01:46:54,980 --> 01:46:58,401
bad guys or whether your mission is to 
manufacture something or sell something 

2074
01:46:58,401 --> 01:47:00,330
or produce something.
You're trying to.

2075
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:05,390
You got a group of people,
group of individuals and they're going 

2076
01:47:05,390 --> 01:47:06,270
to be diverse.
They're going to be different.

2077
01:47:06,271 --> 01:47:08,560
They're going to have different 
intelligence levels.

2078
01:47:08,561 --> 01:47:09,880
They're gonna,
have different personalities,

2079
01:47:09,881 --> 01:47:10,820
they're gonna,
have different goals,

2080
01:47:10,821 --> 01:47:15,821
are gonna have different motivations and
you got to take all those people and 

2081
01:47:15,821 --> 01:47:19,941
unify them and try and get them to 
accomplish a mission in the most 

2082
01:47:19,941 --> 01:47:24,510
effective and efficient manner.
And that's leadership and it does it.

2083
01:47:24,511 --> 01:47:29,511
Like I said,
that those principles that we used in 

2084
01:47:29,511 --> 01:47:32,241
combat don't change regardless of what 
the mission is and what,

2085
01:47:32,541 --> 01:47:33,270
what's good.
You know,

2086
01:47:33,271 --> 01:47:38,271
and I said this earlier,
life is like combat but amplified and 

2087
01:47:38,281 --> 01:47:41,880
intensified or combat is combat is like 
life.

2088
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:46,320
But amplified and intensified and,
and that means when we tell a story,

2089
01:47:46,321 --> 01:47:50,230
like a leadership story about combat,
it,

2090
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:53,040
it,
it's so obvious what the,

2091
01:47:53,070 --> 01:47:54,270
what the principal was.

2092
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:59,360
Whereas in the business world,
they might take six months or a year or 

2093
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:00,300
maybe you barely even notice what the 
failure was,

2094
01:48:00,750 --> 01:48:02,750
you know?
And when we sit,

2095
01:48:02,751 --> 01:48:07,751
when we,
when we make those stark examples from 

2096
01:48:07,751 --> 01:48:07,751
combat,
people go,

2097
01:48:07,751 --> 01:48:07,751
oh,
oh,

2098
01:48:07,751 --> 01:48:09,810
I see how we're failing in this too.
And that's,

2099
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:12,150
that's why I think people really took 
hold of,

2100
01:48:12,190 --> 01:48:17,190
of what we did and how we put it across.
So this was something that you were 

2101
01:48:17,190 --> 01:48:20,180
approached to do.
This wasn't an idea that you had had and

2102
01:48:20,181 --> 01:48:22,170
you thought about this will be my new 
thing.

2103
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:22,800
Yeah.
And I mean,

2104
01:48:23,010 --> 01:48:28,010
regardless of all this garbage that I 
talk in my life and I've always telling 

2105
01:48:28,010 --> 01:48:28,590
people to like plan and be prepared.
Yeah.

2106
01:48:28,591 --> 01:48:33,591
I,
I almost completely fell into this with 

2107
01:48:33,591 --> 01:48:33,591
the fact that,
you know,

2108
01:48:33,591 --> 01:48:33,600
someone said,
hey,

2109
01:48:33,601 --> 01:48:35,550
can you come and talk to my people about
leadership?

2110
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:36,240
And I said,
well,

2111
01:48:36,241 --> 01:48:41,241
yeah,
I've been talking about leadership for 

2112
01:48:41,241 --> 01:48:42,030
last several years in the seal teams and
I've been in leadership position in some

2113
01:48:42,031 --> 01:48:46,860
pretty tough situations and you know,
that's just,

2114
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:48,540
that's just happened.
Now,

2115
01:48:48,541 --> 01:48:53,541
do you teach a course or is this a,
is this like a one time seminar type of 

2116
01:48:53,791 --> 01:48:55,050
a thing?
We do both.

2117
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:57,300
Well,
so sometimes we go in,

2118
01:48:57,390 --> 01:49:02,390
you know,
and we'll do like a keynote speech and 

2119
01:49:02,390 --> 01:49:02,390
those are good.
Those are good.

2120
01:49:02,390 --> 01:49:02,390
Those are great,
you know,

2121
01:49:02,390 --> 01:49:04,230
we get a lot of positive feedback about 
those,

2122
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:09,440
but then sometimes we'll go in with 
company and we've done like two year 

2123
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:12,051
contracts with companies where we've 
trained everybody that they have and we 

2124
01:49:12,051 --> 01:49:13,140
get all their leadership aligned on the 
same page and,

2125
01:49:13,290 --> 01:49:18,290
and we'll,
we'll go in for maybe a couple of an 

2126
01:49:18,290 --> 01:49:18,660
assessment,
we'll look and see what,

2127
01:49:18,661 --> 01:49:21,390
learn about what business they're in,
will learn about what they're doing,

2128
01:49:21,391 --> 01:49:26,391
how they're doing it,
we'll see what areas they can improve 

2129
01:49:26,391 --> 01:49:28,941
on.
We'll formulate a plan around that and 

2130
01:49:28,941 --> 01:49:28,941
it will come back and we'll train 
leadership.

2131
01:49:28,941 --> 01:49:33,320
That's fascinating.
So you have to kind of construct a 

2132
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:33,320
course.
Yes,

2133
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:34,160
yes.
I mean the,

2134
01:49:34,290 --> 01:49:36,240
the basic,
like I said,

2135
01:49:36,241 --> 01:49:37,650
the basic principles are always the 
same,

2136
01:49:37,651 --> 01:49:41,070
but some organizations have different 
problems than other organizations.

2137
01:49:41,250 --> 01:49:43,230
They all,
they all have the same,

2138
01:49:43,290 --> 01:49:44,550
you know,
five,

2139
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:46,050
seven problems,
you know,

2140
01:49:46,051 --> 01:49:48,040
whatever that number is.
Some of them were

2141
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:51,340
really bad at this are really good at 
this or they're failing here,

2142
01:49:51,341 --> 01:49:53,650
but they're winning here.
So we got to go in and check them out,

2143
01:49:53,651 --> 01:49:54,850
see what,
see what the issue is,

2144
01:49:54,851 --> 01:49:58,600
and then we get it turned around.
Is this for warding for you d,

2145
01:49:58,601 --> 01:50:00,610
do you enjoy doing this?
Yeah,

2146
01:50:00,611 --> 01:50:01,360
absolutely.
I mean,

2147
01:50:01,361 --> 01:50:02,530
I,
I,

2148
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:04,360
well,
number one,

2149
01:50:04,361 --> 01:50:06,940
I can talk about combat all day long and
I can talk about.

2150
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:09,100
And even more than that,
I can talk about leadership all day long

2151
01:50:09,101 --> 01:50:10,220
because it's,
it's,

2152
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:12,340
it's the,
it's the most challenging thing.

2153
01:50:12,341 --> 01:50:17,341
The most challenging thing about being 
in combat in a leadership position is 

2154
01:50:17,561 --> 01:50:18,400
not,
you know,

2155
01:50:18,640 --> 01:50:20,590
trying to figure out what the enemy's 
going to do and trying to,

2156
01:50:20,890 --> 01:50:25,890
trying to organize a good plan.
The most challenging thing is dealing 

2157
01:50:25,890 --> 01:50:29,581
with all these human beings that that's 
the challenging thing is getting these 

2158
01:50:29,581 --> 01:50:33,520
guys and girls to do what they need to 
do,

2159
01:50:33,550 --> 01:50:36,250
what you need them to do,
to get them to believe in it.

2160
01:50:36,790 --> 01:50:41,790
That's what's challenging.
And we definitely learned lessons 

2161
01:50:41,790 --> 01:50:42,790
positive and negative.
You know,

2162
01:50:42,910 --> 01:50:47,910
that's one thing about our book that 
people have gotten a lot of feedback is 

2163
01:50:47,910 --> 01:50:48,070
this book isn't like,
Hey,

2164
01:50:48,071 --> 01:50:49,780
look what we did.
Look how awesome we are.

2165
01:50:49,810 --> 01:50:50,650
No,
this book is.

2166
01:50:50,830 --> 01:50:52,660
A lot of those chapters in that book 
are,

2167
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:55,270
Hey,
this is what we screwed up.

2168
01:50:55,390 --> 01:51:00,100
Here's the failure that happened.
This was a horrible situation and it was

2169
01:51:00,101 --> 01:51:03,370
my fault.
That's where we learn the lessons.

2170
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:07,030
And I think that's what's made people 
relate to it more because we're not just

2171
01:51:07,031 --> 01:51:07,420
saying,
hey,

2172
01:51:07,421 --> 01:51:09,220
we're the greatest thing in the world.
No,

2173
01:51:09,460 --> 01:51:10,210
we were,
uh,

2174
01:51:10,450 --> 01:51:12,220
we were humbled by combat.
We were,

2175
01:51:12,430 --> 01:51:17,430
we were humbled by the enemy.
We were humbled by our own guys that did

2176
01:51:18,401 --> 01:51:23,080
amazing things when we were around.
So I think that's a little bit different

2177
01:51:23,081 --> 01:51:23,590
as well.
And again,

2178
01:51:23,591 --> 01:51:28,030
I think that's one of the things that 
makes peep that appeals to the people is

2179
01:51:28,031 --> 01:51:29,260
they look at this and they go,
oh,

2180
01:51:29,261 --> 01:51:30,070
I can relate to that.

2181
01:51:30,070 --> 01:51:31,930
I can understand it.
I've failed to.

2182
01:51:31,931 --> 01:51:33,340
I made a mistake.
Oh,

2183
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:34,300
how did they handle it?
Oh,

2184
01:51:34,301 --> 01:51:35,380
they did this.
Okay,

2185
01:51:35,381 --> 01:51:38,100
got it.
When you're talking about combat,

2186
01:51:38,130 --> 01:51:43,130
you're talking about people organizing 
and staying together and figuring out 

2187
01:51:43,130 --> 01:51:46,801
how to lead.
You're talking about these extreme 

2188
01:51:46,801 --> 01:51:46,801
consequences,
the most extreme ever.

2189
01:51:46,930 --> 01:51:49,600
And when you have these extreme 
consequences,

2190
01:51:50,110 --> 01:51:51,490
obviously when there's a lot on the 
line,

2191
01:51:51,491 --> 01:51:56,491
people are going to focus and some 
people are going to fall apart and some 

2192
01:51:56,491 --> 01:51:56,680
people are going to pull together,
but you're gonna,

2193
01:51:56,830 --> 01:52:01,830
you're gonna.
Get people that understand the gravity 

2194
01:52:01,830 --> 01:52:04,591
of the situation.
It would seem to me that it would be 

2195
01:52:04,591 --> 01:52:08,260
much harder to impart that into people 
in the business world.

2196
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:13,210
Amplified and intensified.
So in combat lives are at stake.

2197
01:52:13,211 --> 01:52:15,130
Absolutely.
In business world,

2198
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:18,610
have you ever had to fire anyone before?
No.

2199
01:52:18,930 --> 01:52:23,930
It sucks.
Have you ever had people lose their job 

2200
01:52:23,930 --> 01:52:28,320
and couldn't pay their mortgage and feed
their kids because you screwed up as a 

2201
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:28,320
boss?

2202
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:28,320
No.
That's pressure.

2203
01:52:28,510 --> 01:52:33,510
That is mass.
Have you ever lost hundreds of millions 

2204
01:52:33,510 --> 01:52:34,090
of dollars worth of capital because you 
made a bad decision?

2205
01:52:34,270 --> 01:52:35,050
No,
but you know why?

2206
01:52:35,051 --> 01:52:36,320
It's because I'm not a leader.
See,

2207
01:52:36,321 --> 01:52:39,120
so there's good things and not being a 
leader is the,

2208
01:52:39,190 --> 01:52:41,990
the benefits of non-leadership.
So,

2209
01:52:42,370 --> 01:52:43,130
so you know,
we,

2210
01:52:43,131 --> 01:52:44,560
we,
when people asked me that question is to

2211
01:52:44,561 --> 01:52:45,860
ask that question all the time.
I'm like,

2212
01:52:45,890 --> 01:52:47,450
Hey,
it's not about,

2213
01:52:47,510 --> 01:52:49,670
it's not about lives,
but it's about livelihoods,

2214
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:54,760
right?
You've got people that are relying on 

2215
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:56,651
you to succeed and win and again,
sure you get killed in combat.

2216
01:52:56,690 --> 01:52:58,880
That's obviously the worst thing that 
can happen,

2217
01:52:59,090 --> 01:53:01,890
but if you lose your job or you know 
your,

2218
01:53:01,940 --> 01:53:06,940
your people lose their jobs.
Many people killed themselves all the 

2219
01:53:06,940 --> 01:53:06,940
time.
When they make bad business decisions,

2220
01:53:06,940 --> 01:53:09,290
it's that much pressure.
It's that much pressure for sure.

2221
01:53:09,530 --> 01:53:14,530
And so that's why it does translate 
because business people relate to that 

2222
01:53:14,530 --> 01:53:16,030
amount of pressure and they understand 
how it feels to,

2223
01:53:16,050 --> 01:53:17,360
to have that bearing down on them.

2224
01:53:17,780 --> 01:53:22,780
It just seems to me for a guy like you 
that maybe you will be even more 

2225
01:53:22,780 --> 01:53:27,191
attracted to going into business then 
you would be to teaching people how to 

2226
01:53:27,861 --> 01:53:30,080
lead their businesses better.
Yeah.

2227
01:53:30,081 --> 01:53:35,081
And I'm in,
it is a business where you a business 

2228
01:53:35,081 --> 01:53:36,040
and it is definitely what we're doing.
Um,

2229
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:39,020
and that being said,
for me to now go into business,

2230
01:53:39,021 --> 01:53:40,730
I'd have to learn some new business.
Well,

2231
01:53:41,270 --> 01:53:42,950
why not just take the skills that I do 
have,

2232
01:53:42,951 --> 01:53:44,000
which is,
you know,

2233
01:53:44,090 --> 01:53:47,300
we know about leadership.
So let's just help other people.

2234
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:52,390
And that is rewarding.
It's very rewarding to talk to someone 

2235
01:53:52,390 --> 01:53:55,540
and have them go,
I did what you told me to do and this is

2236
01:53:55,731 --> 01:54:00,731
the result.
This is the outcome that's very 

2237
01:54:00,731 --> 01:54:00,731
rewarding.
And,

2238
01:54:00,731 --> 01:54:01,180
and another piece of it is,
you know,

2239
01:54:01,220 --> 01:54:04,010
everything always ties to me back to 
America.

2240
01:54:05,610 --> 01:54:06,420
The,
the,

2241
01:54:06,470 --> 01:54:10,970
the businesses in this country are the 
economic power of this nation.

2242
01:54:10,971 --> 01:54:15,020
And our economic power is the backbone 
of our authority in the world.

2243
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:17,450
And so to help businesses grow and 
achieve is,

2244
01:54:17,540 --> 01:54:19,650
is very rewarding because I know that 
it's a,

2245
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:22,580
it's a very patriotic thing to do.
Capitalism is,

2246
01:54:22,620 --> 01:54:24,650
is,
is a very patriotic piece of America.

2247
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:27,740
That's an interesting perspective.
That's an interesting way to look at the

2248
01:54:27,741 --> 01:54:29,540
big picture.
And I agree with you.

2249
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:31,880
I'm going to say something that people 
hate me saying,

2250
01:54:31,881 --> 01:54:34,370
but I'm gonna say it because I need to 
say it to you.

2251
01:54:34,371 --> 01:54:39,371
You should have a podcast.
People always get mad at me because I 

2252
01:54:39,371 --> 01:54:39,371
say this all the time to interesting 
guests,

2253
01:54:39,371 --> 01:54:44,261
but this is not something that's 
difficult to do and you'd be fucking 

2254
01:54:44,261 --> 01:54:46,040
great at it.
And I think that your perspective on the

2255
01:54:46,041 --> 01:54:49,340
military and your perspective on our,
our,

2256
01:54:49,380 --> 01:54:53,090
our situation overseas I think would be 
very unusual,

2257
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:55,760
very unusual and very educated.

2258
01:54:56,120 --> 01:54:59,350
And I just think there's,
there's no one out there that's doing it

2259
01:54:59,351 --> 01:55:00,530
like,
like you could do it.

2260
01:55:01,220 --> 01:55:02,360
Well we definitely,
I've,

2261
01:55:02,361 --> 01:55:03,260
I've,
you're not.

2262
01:55:03,261 --> 01:55:04,670
The first person said that to me.
As a matter of fact,

2263
01:55:04,671 --> 01:55:07,760
when Tim Ferriss,
like we got done with the podcast and he

2264
01:55:07,761 --> 01:55:10,010
pressed stop on the thing and he just 
looked up at me and said,

2265
01:55:10,070 --> 01:55:13,890
you need to do your own podcast for him.
I've talked to.

2266
01:55:15,560 --> 01:55:16,890
I've talked to.
I've talked to some of my,

2267
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:18,590
some of my,
some of my buddies about it.

2268
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:20,670
And uh,
we're,

2269
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:22,790
we're working.
You have to do man.

2270
01:55:22,791 --> 01:55:24,050
Get a fucking phone.
Yeah.

2271
01:55:24,140 --> 01:55:24,770
Phone.
Yeah.

2272
01:55:24,860 --> 01:55:26,330
Press record,
you know,

2273
01:55:26,360 --> 01:55:28,190
sit down with people.
It's not hard to do.

2274
01:55:28,220 --> 01:55:29,300
It's easy.
Trust me.

2275
01:55:29,550 --> 01:55:29,870
No,
it's,

2276
01:55:29,871 --> 01:55:30,770
uh,
it's interesting too,

2277
01:55:30,771 --> 01:55:32,860
and I'm getting over the fact of,
uh,

2278
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:34,200
like I told you earlier,
I'm like,

2279
01:55:34,201 --> 01:55:36,140
I,
like I said on the Tim Ferriss program,

2280
01:55:37,060 --> 01:55:42,060
you know,
people that just talk for no reason and 

2281
01:55:42,060 --> 01:55:44,040
it's hard for me to get used to like the
fact that somebody wants to hear

2282
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:45,760
what I have to say that's not,
you know,

2283
01:55:46,170 --> 01:55:49,380
a seal or you know,
a direct businessperson.

2284
01:55:49,710 --> 01:55:50,130
But,
uh,

2285
01:55:50,131 --> 01:55:51,710
I'm definitely,
you know what,

2286
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:53,250
I'll probably end up doing something 
with it.

2287
01:55:54,050 --> 01:55:55,410
Well,
I think you know,

2288
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:59,470
great military leaders,
whether it's Zau,

2289
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:01,370
it's sung sue,
the art of war,

2290
01:56:01,371 --> 01:56:06,371
whether it's me,
a motive Musashi from the book of five 

2291
01:56:06,371 --> 01:56:08,651
rings,
Great Warriors from the past have 

2292
01:56:08,651 --> 01:56:12,280
written books that civilians have gotten
a lot out of and I think that someone 

2293
01:56:13,581 --> 01:56:16,730
like you instead of writing a book and 
your book,

2294
01:56:16,731 --> 01:56:19,760
I'm sure it's great and I'm sure there's
a lot of lessons in that,

2295
01:56:20,120 --> 01:56:23,300
but on a daily basis to be able to do 
something like this.

2296
01:56:23,301 --> 01:56:26,660
Anytime you want,
just fire up your podcast anytime.

2297
01:56:26,661 --> 01:56:29,390
Something like Paris,
like the Paris attack happens.

2298
01:56:29,660 --> 01:56:34,660
You could give your perspective 
instantaneously uploaded onto the 

2299
01:56:34,660 --> 01:56:36,890
Internet and it's just never been a time
like that.

2300
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:42,040
It's wonderful that we could sit down 
and read what [inaudible] Musashi wrote 

2301
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:43,000
hundreds of years ago.
I mean,

2302
01:56:43,010 --> 01:56:43,970
it's.
It's amazing.

2303
01:56:43,971 --> 01:56:48,971
It's interesting you should say,
to try to peer into the mind of one of 

2304
01:56:48,971 --> 01:56:51,650
the greatest swordsman that ever lived 
and see his philosophies on life,

2305
01:56:52,130 --> 01:56:57,130
but I think that today with the advent 
of the Internet and with the ability to 

2306
01:56:59,601 --> 01:57:02,570
broadcast yourself virtually 
instantaneously,

2307
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:04,220
I think you could.

2308
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:09,280
You could make a gigantic impact in 
sharing that perspective and taking 

2309
01:57:10,941 --> 01:57:15,941
those experiences that you have so 
deserved and so earned and,

2310
01:57:16,510 --> 01:57:18,970
and giving people this insight that 
there's just,

2311
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:20,510
they're just not going to get it.
You know,

2312
01:57:20,511 --> 01:57:22,220
I'm getting it from you.
Like I said,

2313
01:57:22,490 --> 01:57:27,490
I got it from you from that Tim Ferriss 
episode and I'm getting it even more 

2314
01:57:27,490 --> 01:57:28,340
from you now.
It's a perspective.

2315
01:57:28,341 --> 01:57:31,040
You're just not going to get from 
someone who wasn't there.

2316
01:57:31,070 --> 01:57:33,890
You're just not going to get it.
You're going to get these fuzzy,

2317
01:57:34,340 --> 01:57:39,340
but it's like two people sit.
You ever heard two people talk about 

2318
01:57:39,340 --> 01:57:39,980
martial arts?
Don't know shit about martial arts,

2319
01:57:40,310 --> 01:57:45,310
you know,
that's what it's like to hear someone 

2320
01:57:45,310 --> 01:57:45,310
like me talk about the military.
Really?

2321
01:57:45,310 --> 01:57:45,310
Yeah.
And it's,

2322
01:57:45,310 --> 01:57:47,060
it's again,
it's another thing that,

2323
01:57:47,150 --> 01:57:48,400
that is a,
I'm

2324
01:57:50,740 --> 01:57:55,740
sorting out in my own head,
which is this idea of broadcasting 

2325
01:57:55,740 --> 01:57:57,170
myself.
Uh,

2326
01:57:57,820 --> 01:57:59,110
it's just,
it's just weird.

2327
01:57:59,111 --> 01:57:59,980
I mean,
you grew up,

2328
01:58:00,010 --> 01:58:01,300
you were into this,
you know,

2329
01:58:01,301 --> 01:58:06,301
I think you,
you've been a comedian for your pretty 

2330
01:58:06,301 --> 01:58:07,690
much your whole adult life for 26 years,
so 26 years you were getting on stage.

2331
01:58:07,750 --> 01:58:10,870
That's what you wanted to do.
And honestly,

2332
01:58:10,871 --> 01:58:15,790
when I first joined the seal teams,
that was the most frowned upon thing was

2333
01:58:15,791 --> 01:58:18,010
to be broadcasting yourself that you 
were a seal,

2334
01:58:18,160 --> 01:58:21,610
that you were at what you did and it.
And it took me a long time.

2335
01:58:21,611 --> 01:58:22,120
I mean,
right.

2336
01:58:22,180 --> 01:58:23,890
Writing this book was a,
was a,

2337
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:30,640
it's,
it's a really hard thing to do because 

2338
01:58:30,640 --> 01:58:30,640
you sit there and you,
you know,

2339
01:58:30,640 --> 01:58:30,640
you,
you're,

2340
01:58:30,640 --> 01:58:31,520
you're supposed to be humble,
right?

2341
01:58:31,580 --> 01:58:32,780
You're a warrior.
You're supposed to be humble.

2342
01:58:32,870 --> 01:58:34,610
Okay,
well I'm going to write a big book about

2343
01:58:34,611 --> 01:58:35,780
myself.
I mean that just did,

2344
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:38,610
that just doesn't work.
And so it was really hard and,

2345
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:43,640
and Lafe and I,
that was one of the biggest things that 

2346
01:58:43,640 --> 01:58:45,070
we did as we edited it and edited it and
edited it.

2347
01:58:45,460 --> 01:58:50,460
We went through it just to just to make 
sure that we were coming across and 

2348
01:58:50,460 --> 01:58:54,961
saying things in a manner that really 
reflected that humility,

2349
01:58:56,381 --> 01:59:01,381
which again,
it's very hard to do because it's a 

2350
01:59:01,381 --> 01:59:01,900
dichotomy.
It's a dichotomy because you're saying,

2351
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:03,970
hey,
you got to be humble as a leader,

2352
01:59:04,770 --> 01:59:06,190
but I'm gonna read a big book about 
myself.

2353
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:08,050
You know what I mean?
It's just crazy.

2354
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:09,970
And so when you're sitting here like,
oh,

2355
01:59:09,971 --> 01:59:11,290
you should have a podcast and I'm 
thinking,

2356
01:59:12,370 --> 01:59:14,740
you know,
you should broadcast yourself.

2357
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:19,800
And again,
with the way I was raised because you 

2358
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:22,831
spent your whole adult life in comedy,
I spent my whole adult life in the seal 

2359
01:59:22,831 --> 01:59:25,951
teams and I was raised by these old 
Vietnam guys that were bad asses and 

2360
01:59:27,460 --> 01:59:27,880
they were like,
oh,

2361
01:59:27,881 --> 01:59:29,240
you don't talk about this.
Right?

2362
01:59:29,410 --> 01:59:32,900
And so I'm kind of going against this 
the way I was raised and,

2363
01:59:33,060 --> 01:59:35,110
and so again I'm,
I'm getting over it,

2364
01:59:35,380 --> 01:59:38,740
I'm trying to get over it,
but at the same time I don't want to get

2365
01:59:38,741 --> 01:59:40,660
completely over it because that's part 
of,

2366
01:59:41,110 --> 01:59:46,110
you know,
that's part of the way I was raised and 

2367
01:59:46,110 --> 01:59:46,110
what I believe in.
Even

2368
01:59:46,110 --> 01:59:46,110
I see their point of view.
I,

2369
01:59:46,110 --> 01:59:48,420
I totally understand why they would say 
you don't talk about it,

2370
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:53,720
but what I think the benefit of talking 
about it today as opposed to their time 

2371
01:59:53,720 --> 01:59:57,990
is through the Internet.
You can broadcast in a way that would be

2372
01:59:57,991 --> 01:59:58,740
like,
look,

2373
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:04,040
no one's going to take a navy seal back 
in the day and give them a gigantic 

2374
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:06,360
television show where they could say 
whatever the fuck they wanted,

2375
02:00:06,690 --> 02:00:10,380
broadcast anytime they wanted.
But if you have a successful podcast,

2376
02:00:10,620 --> 02:00:13,260
you can reach hundreds of thousands of 
people with each episode,

2377
02:00:13,261 --> 02:00:15,390
which is just like a successful 
television show.

2378
02:00:15,930 --> 02:00:20,930
And because of that,
you have the ability to educate people 

2379
02:00:20,930 --> 02:00:24,921
and give people this perspective that I 
said that I got from you that are just 

2380
02:00:24,921 --> 02:00:26,220
not getting.
I'm not getting from anybody else unless

2381
02:00:26,221 --> 02:00:28,050
they've been there,
but I get it from you.

2382
02:00:28,050 --> 02:00:30,390
I get it from Tim Kennedy.
I get it from Brian Stann.

2383
02:00:30,770 --> 02:00:31,860
I get it from Andy.
Stop.

2384
02:00:31,861 --> 02:00:33,690
I get it from people that have been 
there and you.

2385
02:00:33,691 --> 02:00:38,691
You get a different perspective than 
you're ever going to get from someone 

2386
02:00:38,691 --> 02:00:43,011
who's just pontificating or guessing 
waxing poetically on the nature of man 

2387
02:00:43,011 --> 02:00:44,310
and war.
It's all bullshit.

2388
02:00:44,580 --> 02:00:46,560
Until you talk to someone who's actually
been there,

2389
02:00:46,770 --> 02:00:49,410
you don't really understand what they're
saying.

2390
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:52,920
I think that I think it would be 
gigantic.

2391
02:00:52,921 --> 02:00:54,300
I really think you should do it.
I really.

2392
02:00:54,301 --> 02:00:56,100
I really think it would help a lot of 
people.

2393
02:00:56,370 --> 02:01:01,370
I think it would help a lot of people 
understand from the perspective of 

2394
02:01:01,370 --> 02:01:05,091
someone who actually knows what they're 
talking about and there's not a lot of 

2395
02:01:05,091 --> 02:01:06,960
that in the world.
I think this is also what you're talking

2396
02:01:06,961 --> 02:01:09,780
about when you're talking about the 
leadership in this country.

2397
02:01:10,290 --> 02:01:11,410
It's.
I don't.

2398
02:01:11,570 --> 02:01:16,570
I don't know if you should be someone 
who has served in the military in order 

2399
02:01:16,570 --> 02:01:21,141
to qualify for being the president,
but I don't think it's a bad idea to 

2400
02:01:21,141 --> 02:01:25,401
throw it out there to to say that at the
very least you should spend some time 

2401
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:30,630
living in these environments where we're
involved in massive conflict.

2402
02:01:31,290 --> 02:01:36,290
At the very least you should visit them,
spend a lot of time with the people who 

2403
02:01:36,290 --> 02:01:38,910
have lived and served and fought in 
these countries.

2404
02:01:38,911 --> 02:01:39,920
So you understand

2405
02:01:41,450 --> 02:01:45,920
clearly with no fuzziness at all.
What the fuck is going on in the world?

2406
02:01:47,580 --> 02:01:52,580
Well,
there's no doubt that I think military 

2407
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:52,580
service.
I mean

2408
02:01:54,090 --> 02:01:58,200
it was so good for me.
It was so good for me.

2409
02:01:58,440 --> 02:02:01,170
And would it be good for everybody would
have been about Jamie over there?

2410
02:02:01,620 --> 02:02:03,440
Look at him.
I don't know either.

2411
02:02:03,450 --> 02:02:04,440
So you just said,
I don't know.

2412
02:02:04,441 --> 02:02:09,441
I'm not 100 percent sure.
I guarantee Jamie would get it all out 

2413
02:02:09,441 --> 02:02:10,620
of.
I'm sure he wouldn't get it.

2414
02:02:10,650 --> 02:02:15,650
I guarantee you.
But he might wind up like that dude and 

2415
02:02:15,650 --> 02:02:15,650
full metal jacket with a rifle in the 
bathroom.

2416
02:02:16,280 --> 02:02:17,750
Private Kyle.
Yet.

2417
02:02:17,760 --> 02:02:21,190
So,
uh,

2418
02:02:24,530 --> 02:02:25,940
yeah,
um,

2419
02:02:26,310 --> 02:02:26,970
I,
I did,

2420
02:02:27,010 --> 02:02:27,720
you know,
in the military,

2421
02:02:27,721 --> 02:02:29,790
did the military was great for me and,
and,

2422
02:02:30,030 --> 02:02:30,720
but again,
you,

2423
02:02:30,721 --> 02:02:35,721
you were born for this.
I mean this is like something you were 

2424
02:02:35,721 --> 02:02:36,000
drawn to,
like a magnet to metal filings.

2425
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:37,000
Yeah,
no,

2426
02:02:37,020 --> 02:02:38,220
I was,
I was drawn to it,

2427
02:02:38,221 --> 02:02:38,550
but

2428
02:02:40,470 --> 02:02:42,480
I was still like,
when I joined my dad,

2429
02:02:42,870 --> 02:02:44,640
my dad said to me,
uh,

2430
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:48,000
you're going to hate it because you hate
authority.

2431
02:02:48,030 --> 02:02:49,260
That's what my dad said to me.
I was like,

2432
02:02:49,690 --> 02:02:51,140
okay,
uh,

2433
02:02:51,690 --> 02:02:52,050
and,
you know,

2434
02:02:52,540 --> 02:02:54,960
that gives you an indication as to what 
kind of kid I was.

2435
02:02:54,961 --> 02:02:59,961
I was completely out of control and 
didn't listen to anybody and I was 

2436
02:02:59,961 --> 02:03:01,050
probably similar to what you were like,
I'm guessing,

2437
02:03:01,460 --> 02:03:02,530
um,
you know,

2438
02:03:02,540 --> 02:03:04,560
I was just now to control kid that just 
did whatever.

2439
02:03:05,130 --> 02:03:09,540
And so joining the military it put it,
put the structure around me and all of a

2440
02:03:09,541 --> 02:03:11,490
sudden I could take all this energy that
I had.

2441
02:03:11,610 --> 02:03:16,610
And,
and what's really nice about is you get 

2442
02:03:16,610 --> 02:03:16,610
this clean slate where they're like,
okay,

2443
02:03:16,610 --> 02:03:16,610
if you do this,
you'll be successful.

2444
02:03:16,610 --> 02:03:18,090
Here's what you do.
Check these boxes and I was like,

2445
02:03:18,091 --> 02:03:19,830
okay,
I'm ready to do those things,

2446
02:03:20,220 --> 02:03:24,060
and you just do them and you develop the
discipline.

2447
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:26,220
The discipline,
and I talk about that all the time.

2448
02:03:26,221 --> 02:03:26,650
You know,
the,

2449
02:03:26,680 --> 02:03:31,680
the fact that discipline equals freedom 
and the more discipline you have as a 

2450
02:03:31,680 --> 02:03:32,070
human,
the more freedom you're going to have,

2451
02:03:32,100 --> 02:03:34,140
which is completely counterintuitive.
You know,

2452
02:03:34,290 --> 02:03:35,220
people think,
oh,

2453
02:03:35,221 --> 02:03:37,510
you're living this discipline lifestyle,
so that means you,

2454
02:03:37,700 --> 02:03:39,030
you,
you don't have any freedom.

2455
02:03:39,210 --> 02:03:44,210
And it's actually the exact opposite.
I have freedom because I have 

2456
02:03:44,210 --> 02:03:44,210
discipline,
I have,

2457
02:03:44,210 --> 02:03:45,060
I have,
you know,

2458
02:03:45,150 --> 02:03:47,580
financial freedom because I have 
financial discipline,

2459
02:03:47,850 --> 02:03:52,850
I have more time,
I have more time because I have the 

2460
02:03:52,850 --> 02:03:54,570
discipline to get up in the morning 
before most normal people get up.

2461
02:03:54,900 --> 02:03:56,580
Those are the kinds of disciplines that 
you put in place.

2462
02:03:56,581 --> 02:03:58,380
And those definitely get instilled 
through the military.

2463
02:03:59,130 --> 02:04:04,130
Well,
I think the one thing that disciplined 

2464
02:04:04,130 --> 02:04:05,931
definitely does help you with is it 
helps you get things done and when you 

2465
02:04:06,541 --> 02:04:08,030
get things done,
when you,

2466
02:04:08,230 --> 02:04:10,330
you actually do things,
you,

2467
02:04:10,340 --> 02:04:11,120
you,
you,

2468
02:04:11,200 --> 02:04:14,840
you have more success.
If you have more success and sometimes a

2469
02:04:14,850 --> 02:04:18,210
big part of success is just not being 
fucking lazy and just doing it,

2470
02:04:18,540 --> 02:04:23,540
just get.
That's like 90 percent of it is just 

2471
02:04:23,540 --> 02:04:25,461
showing up,
get there and start working like you're 

2472
02:04:25,461 --> 02:04:26,160
not going to feel perfect every day.
If I felt,

2473
02:04:26,210 --> 02:04:31,210
if I only worked out when I felt good,
I'd be a fat fuck because there's a lot 

2474
02:04:31,210 --> 02:04:35,481
of days I don't want to do it.
I've been pretty much the same with 

2475
02:04:35,481 --> 02:04:38,150
everybody that that actually gets good 
at something that you get.

2476
02:04:38,150 --> 02:04:41,850
There's got to be those days you pushed 
through and they're probably going to be

2477
02:04:41,851 --> 02:04:46,851
more numerous than the days you don't.
And so the benefit of discipline in my 

2478
02:04:46,851 --> 02:04:49,770
eyes has always been that through 
discipline I get things done.

2479
02:04:50,130 --> 02:04:54,330
I always tell them,
I always say that I'm like the most lazy

2480
02:04:54,331 --> 02:04:57,480
disciplined person I know because I 
don't want to do it,

2481
02:04:57,990 --> 02:04:58,920
but I always do.

2482
02:04:59,030 --> 02:05:01,160
And I'd be interesting to get your 
perspective on this,

2483
02:05:01,220 --> 02:05:06,220
this statement.
So I also think that discipline is,

2484
02:05:08,150 --> 02:05:13,150
is a pathway to creativity.
And I'll tell you when I talk about 

2485
02:05:13,150 --> 02:05:16,721
creativity is another misconception 
about the military when you're on the 

2486
02:05:16,721 --> 02:05:19,811
battlefield is an absolute exercise in 
creativity.

2487
02:05:20,420 --> 02:05:25,420
Okay?
I already talked about how you're going 

2488
02:05:25,420 --> 02:05:25,420
to lead these people.
What are you going to do?

2489
02:05:25,420 --> 02:05:26,360
How you're going to influence them,
how you going to talk to them?

2490
02:05:26,361 --> 02:05:27,920
How are you going to say the right 
things?

2491
02:05:27,921 --> 02:05:30,800
That's creativity.
Now you throw on top of that,

2492
02:05:30,950 --> 02:05:31,880
what am I going to do?
The enemy,

2493
02:05:32,210 --> 02:05:35,840
how are we going to attack them?
How are we going to disorganize them?

2494
02:05:35,841 --> 02:05:40,841
How are we going to get in their heads?
That's all just massive creativity.

2495
02:05:41,090 --> 02:05:43,550
And when I look at people that are 
artists like yourself,

2496
02:05:43,551 --> 02:05:46,270
because you're a standup comedian,
you are,

2497
02:05:46,340 --> 02:05:50,270
I would imagine that the more 
disciplined you are the,

2498
02:05:50,330 --> 02:05:51,590
you know,
you got to get up and write,

2499
02:05:51,591 --> 02:05:56,591
you gotta write stuff down.
You got to read and find out about 

2500
02:05:56,591 --> 02:06:00,131
what's going on in the world so you have
more things that you can jab baton and 

2501
02:06:00,131 --> 02:06:01,610
make fun of.
You got to increase your vocabulary.

2502
02:06:01,611 --> 02:06:06,611
So that you are quicker and sharper so 
that when people are saying things that 

2503
02:06:06,611 --> 02:06:06,620
you have more words to battle back at 
them,

2504
02:06:06,920 --> 02:06:10,010
all those things,
all that freedom that you get on stage,

2505
02:06:10,180 --> 02:06:13,490
it comes from the discipline that you 
study.

2506
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:14,990
You learn,
you read,

2507
02:06:15,050 --> 02:06:16,430
you write,
you talk,

2508
02:06:16,490 --> 02:06:18,830
you go through things.
Is that an accurate state?

2509
02:06:19,040 --> 02:06:21,350
Absolutely accurate.
There's a great book on it.

2510
02:06:21,410 --> 02:06:26,410
Steven Pressfield wrote a book called 
the war of art and press field was 

2511
02:06:26,410 --> 02:06:28,940
essentially like a ne'er do well until 
he was 40 years old.

2512
02:06:28,941 --> 02:06:31,760
He was kind of a fuck up and then 
figured it out.

2513
02:06:31,761 --> 02:06:33,110
Somewhere along the line I figured it 
out.

2514
02:06:33,350 --> 02:06:35,360
I used to keep a stack of them in my old
studio,

2515
02:06:35,361 --> 02:06:37,570
not hand them out to guests if I thought
they needed it.

2516
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,560
Take this because trust me,
read this,

2517
02:06:39,830 --> 02:06:44,180
because a lot of artists in comics,
I bet musicians as well,

2518
02:06:44,181 --> 02:06:49,181
but writers for sure.
One of the big problems is sitting down 

2519
02:06:49,181 --> 02:06:53,471
and doing the work and you,
you gotta and Pressfield talks about 

2520
02:06:53,471 --> 02:06:57,731
that in the most concise and beautiful 
way and he labels it like an enemy.

2521
02:06:58,971 --> 02:07:00,880
He calls it resistance,
you know,

2522
02:07:00,890 --> 02:07:03,710
and that you have to sit down and you 
have to overcome resistance and that the

2523
02:07:03,711 --> 02:07:06,710
pro goes to work and he doesn't matter 
if you're sick.

2524
02:07:06,830 --> 02:07:09,200
It doesn't matter if you have kids.
It doesn't matter what you,

2525
02:07:09,250 --> 02:07:14,250
you're a pro and you go to work and that
just it puts it in your head that this 

2526
02:07:15,231 --> 02:07:18,170
is what I do and this is what.
And you have pride in that.

2527
02:07:18,260 --> 02:07:22,910
And then when you are in front of that 
keyboard and you look down the count,

2528
02:07:22,911 --> 02:07:26,160
it says I fucking thousand words today,
I put a thousand more than you,

2529
02:07:26,900 --> 02:07:27,360
you,
you,

2530
02:07:27,410 --> 02:07:29,480
you're doing the work and out of that 
work,

2531
02:07:29,810 --> 02:07:31,100
gems,
blossom,

2532
02:07:31,330 --> 02:07:36,330
little things.
But you might have a day where you just 

2533
02:07:36,330 --> 02:07:38,321
write nothing but dog shit.
So show up again tomorrow and tomorrow 

2534
02:07:38,321 --> 02:07:40,060
out of that dark shit,
a flower emerge you never know.

2535
02:07:40,061 --> 02:07:42,400
And that's the only way to develop.
Real,

2536
02:07:42,780 --> 02:07:45,370
like to,
to really develop your potential.

2537
02:07:45,371 --> 02:07:50,371
One hundred percent in anything.
Whether it's as an author or even as a 

2538
02:07:50,371 --> 02:07:50,371
martial artist.

2539
02:07:50,371 --> 02:07:53,860
There's a lot of creativity in martial 
arts to be a great striker.

2540
02:07:54,100 --> 02:07:56,590
You have to be creative because you have
to.

2541
02:07:56,800 --> 02:08:01,800
You have to develop patterns or execute 
patterns that are aren't going to be 

2542
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:04,990
perceived like if a guy has a real 
simple one,

2543
02:08:04,991 --> 02:08:05,520
two,
one,

2544
02:08:05,530 --> 02:08:10,530
two,
you're going to time that shit and you 

2545
02:08:10,530 --> 02:08:12,410
were talking before the podcast about 
Holly Holmes victory over Rhonda Rousey 

2546
02:08:12,850 --> 02:08:17,850
and one of the things that we were 
talking about was that Rhonda had this 

2547
02:08:17,850 --> 02:08:19,060
very linear,
straightforward attack.

2548
02:08:19,061 --> 02:08:24,010
You knew she was coming and holly is a 
master at at countering,

2549
02:08:24,130 --> 02:08:29,130
so all she had to do was wait and move 
and Rhonda was coming in one direction.

2550
02:08:29,590 --> 02:08:31,030
There was no.
There was.

2551
02:08:31,120 --> 02:08:34,180
There was no variation.
There was no creativity.

2552
02:08:34,181 --> 02:08:39,070
It was a mad bull dog rush that had 
worked on everybody else before,

2553
02:08:39,370 --> 02:08:44,370
but she found one person who was a 
virtuoso at movement and she needed 

2554
02:08:45,131 --> 02:08:48,490
creativity and it wasn't there and she 
needed that experience.

2555
02:08:48,610 --> 02:08:53,610
That came with having faced someone who 
knew that position and new new had a 

2556
02:08:53,831 --> 02:08:58,831
deep understanding of that movement and 
she didn't have that in their 

2557
02:08:58,831 --> 02:08:59,410
repertoire.
And so that's the result that we saw.

2558
02:08:59,860 --> 02:09:01,570
Like a striker,
like Anderson Silva,

2559
02:09:01,571 --> 02:09:04,030
he's extremely creative.
If you watch,

2560
02:09:04,031 --> 02:09:08,770
he's got a fight versus Tony Frequent in
cage warriors,

2561
02:09:08,830 --> 02:09:10,510
cage warriors.
What the fuck was it called?

2562
02:09:10,511 --> 02:09:15,511
In England,
small organization in England where he 

2563
02:09:15,671 --> 02:09:20,671
practiced this step in upper cut elbow,
like a sideways elbow and his coach was 

2564
02:09:21,941 --> 02:09:23,230
going,
you're fucking crazy.

2565
02:09:23,231 --> 02:09:26,800
Stop practicing that,
and he would make his wife hold a pillow

2566
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:32,040
because it's his coach didn't want him 
to practice anymore because he thought 

2567
02:09:32,040 --> 02:09:32,980
he was wasting his time,
so he practiced stepping.

2568
02:09:32,981 --> 02:09:37,981
His wife would hold a pillow for him and
he'd step in and throw this uppercut 

2569
02:09:37,981 --> 02:09:38,860
elbow.
That's when he knocked out Franklin with

2570
02:09:39,130 --> 02:09:42,370
and obviously the Franklin was 
outclassed in that fight,

2571
02:09:42,610 --> 02:09:47,610
but he wanted to make a point and like 
the front kick that he landed the face 

2572
02:09:47,610 --> 02:09:47,610
of Vito Belfort.

2573
02:09:47,610 --> 02:09:52,350
Vito,
I never saw that check coming because 

2574
02:09:52,350 --> 02:09:54,121
nobody had done that to him before 
because nobody had done that in the 

2575
02:09:54,121 --> 02:09:54,250
history of the UFC.
Nobody had ever knocked anybody out.

2576
02:09:54,251 --> 02:09:56,920
With the first kick you learn in martial
arts,

2577
02:09:57,310 --> 02:10:00,220
but the creativity to try something like
that,

2578
02:10:00,221 --> 02:10:03,790
he would throw punches to your thigh 
from standing.

2579
02:10:03,791 --> 02:10:06,760
He would throw a jab to your thigh.
He would throw a crescent kick,

2580
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:10,200
an inside crescent kick to your face,
like what the fuck it was.

2581
02:10:10,230 --> 02:10:15,230
It was part of what made him such an 
effective stryker is that he through 

2582
02:10:15,230 --> 02:10:17,260
these things that you just didn't expect
him to do.

2583
02:10:17,590 --> 02:10:20,230
There's a lot of creativity in Jujitsu.
You know that?

2584
02:10:20,260 --> 02:10:20,690
Yeah.
Well,

2585
02:10:20,710 --> 02:10:21,490
I got,
you know,

2586
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:23,740
Dean lister and Jeff Glover,
or my guys.

2587
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:27,820
Jeff Glover is one of the most creative 
guys in Jujitsu today.

2588
02:10:27,821 --> 02:10:32,821
He's one of my favorite.
He does this thing for folks who don't 

2589
02:10:32,821 --> 02:10:32,821
understand Jujitsu,
don't know what we're talking about.

2590
02:10:33,050 --> 02:10:33,980
He does this thing called

2591
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:36,710
a donkey guard.
He's so fucking crazy.

2592
02:10:36,711 --> 02:10:39,140
This guy,
he gets on literally,

2593
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:44,200
he faces you with his butt to you and he
launches himself backwards like a donkey

2594
02:10:45,291 --> 02:10:50,291
kicking and wraps you up and it looks so
preposterous while he's doing it that so

2595
02:10:50,451 --> 02:10:55,451
many guys,
especially when he first started 

2596
02:10:55,451 --> 02:10:57,521
executing,
it just had no idea what the fuck to do 

2597
02:10:57,521 --> 02:10:57,521
it.
There is right there.

2598
02:10:58,820 --> 02:11:00,480
Got Crazy.
He is,

2599
02:11:01,460 --> 02:11:03,420
he's out of his mind.
He so uh,

2600
02:11:03,650 --> 02:11:05,860
he so comfortable in every,
like,

2601
02:11:05,910 --> 02:11:06,940
you know,
he trains everyday.

2602
02:11:07,140 --> 02:11:12,140
We're the same gym and he trains 
everyday with whoever and he puts 

2603
02:11:12,621 --> 02:11:15,470
himself in the most ridiculously 
horrible positions.

2604
02:11:15,471 --> 02:11:16,610
I'm talking like,
okay,

2605
02:11:16,670 --> 02:11:18,860
he'll let people get a rear naked choke 
on him.

2606
02:11:19,130 --> 02:11:21,530
I mean he all watching them,
like what in God's name,

2607
02:11:21,531 --> 02:11:23,360
how was he going?
And he will escape.

2608
02:11:23,730 --> 02:11:26,430
He just put himself in horrible 
positions all the time just to organize,

2609
02:11:26,740 --> 02:11:29,750
just to work on his defense and just to 
be in a bad way.

2610
02:11:29,870 --> 02:11:32,540
How does he avoid getting hurt?
Because he's not a big guy.

2611
02:11:33,110 --> 02:11:34,400
He's super,
super,

2612
02:11:34,460 --> 02:11:38,660
super flexible.
I'm like crazy flexible and you know,

2613
02:11:38,661 --> 02:11:43,661
he gets dinged up,
but he just is very flexible and he 

2614
02:11:43,661 --> 02:11:43,661
knows where to put his body,
you know,

2615
02:11:43,661 --> 02:11:47,000
he's just a,
he's kind of a freak because I knew that

2616
02:11:47,001 --> 02:11:49,880
he had trained with you.
I was gonna ask you like the idea of you

2617
02:11:49,881 --> 02:11:54,881
and him training together for folks 
listening to this was the majority of 

2618
02:11:54,881 --> 02:11:57,220
our podcast is audio probably 90 percent
year.

2619
02:11:57,230 --> 02:11:59,690
About what to 40 or something like that 
to 35.

2620
02:11:59,720 --> 02:12:00,680
Yeah.
And Jeff's like,

2621
02:12:00,681 --> 02:12:01,630
well,
1:50.

2622
02:12:01,690 --> 02:12:02,470
Yeah,
yeah,

2623
02:12:02,780 --> 02:12:03,710
yeah.
What the fuck?

2624
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:06,250
That's a big.
I don't want to try.

2625
02:12:06,470 --> 02:12:08,450
I weigh 200 pounds.
I don't want to trade with anybody who's

2626
02:12:08,451 --> 02:12:13,451
to 10.
The fact that he's 150 pounds and he's 

2627
02:12:13,641 --> 02:12:16,190
training with gorillas,
know how the fuck he does it.

2628
02:12:16,660 --> 02:12:21,660
He does it.
He's just super relaxed and he just 

2629
02:12:21,660 --> 02:12:21,860
moves and moves really well.
It's amazing.

2630
02:12:21,890 --> 02:12:23,150
It's amazing.
And you know,

2631
02:12:23,151 --> 02:12:24,340
back problems.
He's,

2632
02:12:24,380 --> 02:12:26,090
he's all right.
No neck problems.

2633
02:12:26,250 --> 02:12:29,850
He is 100 percent at all times.
Yeah.

2634
02:12:29,960 --> 02:12:31,280
That's amazing.
Yeah.

2635
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:36,520
Dean's getting little more dinged up.
Do you know Dean looks like he ate a 

2636
02:12:36,520 --> 02:12:36,800
dean.
I saw him the other day.

2637
02:12:36,801 --> 02:12:37,290
I'm like,
what are you,

2638
02:12:37,300 --> 02:12:40,130
a 300 fucking pounds and I don't mean it
in a fat way either.

2639
02:12:40,131 --> 02:12:43,340
He's huge.
He looks gigantic.

2640
02:12:43,400 --> 02:12:44,570
He's,
he's pretty big.

2641
02:12:44,630 --> 02:12:49,630
Yeah,
because he'd just been power lifting or 

2642
02:12:49,630 --> 02:12:49,630
something.
Like what is he doing?

2643
02:12:49,630 --> 02:12:50,060
Uh,
I think he just eats a lot,

2644
02:12:50,650 --> 02:12:54,530
but it's definitely lifting too because 
like food doesn't go right to your neck,

2645
02:12:55,010 --> 02:12:56,840
his neck.
He's a genetic,

2646
02:12:56,980 --> 02:13:01,980
a genetic mutant.
Another using genetic mutant and yeah,

2647
02:13:03,220 --> 02:13:04,520
he's both,
those guys are,

2648
02:13:04,540 --> 02:13:09,540
are mutants,
their actual grappling mutants where if 

2649
02:13:09,771 --> 02:13:12,050
you and I were to like concoct some 
weird,

2650
02:13:12,051 --> 02:13:15,230
you know,
like potion and create beings,

2651
02:13:15,740 --> 02:13:20,740
you know,
you'd make like a Jeff Glover because 

2652
02:13:20,740 --> 02:13:20,740
he's weird.
Flexible,

2653
02:13:20,740 --> 02:13:23,720
wirey and you'd be really good.
And then you'd make a dean lister who's 

2654
02:13:23,720 --> 02:13:24,290
just a big mutant.
Who you,

2655
02:13:24,360 --> 02:13:29,360
you when you,
when you catch dean you have to like do 

2656
02:13:29,360 --> 02:13:29,510
everything perfect.
Because he's,

2657
02:13:29,570 --> 02:13:31,710
his defense is really good and he just 
doesn't.

2658
02:13:31,860 --> 02:13:32,110
It's

2659
02:13:32,130 --> 02:13:33,870
really hard to tap him with stuff,
you know,

2660
02:13:33,871 --> 02:13:35,520
like he,
like he'll just give people,

2661
02:13:35,610 --> 02:13:36,810
you know,
his foot and be like,

2662
02:13:36,870 --> 02:13:37,500
yeah,
go for it.

2663
02:13:39,060 --> 02:13:44,060
And it takes me like three days.
I'll have to soften his foot up with 

2664
02:13:44,060 --> 02:13:45,600
like nine foot locks,
then just crank it,

2665
02:13:45,601 --> 02:13:46,920
granted grandkids and then,
you know,

2666
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:50,760
on the third day I'll get a deep one and
it'll already be like hurt.

2667
02:13:50,790 --> 02:13:51,420
So.
So,

2668
02:13:51,590 --> 02:13:53,940
you know,
so you have to soften them up overseas.

2669
02:13:54,270 --> 02:13:55,490
Tenderizing meat.
Yeah.

2670
02:13:56,640 --> 02:14:01,640
Well that was why it was so shocking 
when Josh Barnett tapped him because 

2671
02:14:01,640 --> 02:14:05,280
Josh Barnett tapped him and like old 
school side like headlock joke,

2672
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:10,760
which is a very rare.
It's very rare that you see like a high 

2673
02:14:10,760 --> 02:14:14,130
level guy that executes that choke.
Like the way Josh did.

2674
02:14:14,430 --> 02:14:17,430
Josh has got that old school catch 
wrestling knowledge too,

2675
02:14:17,431 --> 02:14:21,780
which is just such a different approach 
and you get used to a certain approaches

2676
02:14:22,020 --> 02:14:25,700
and Josh has a very different approach 
and he's a very physically strong guys.

2677
02:14:25,780 --> 02:14:30,780
Well yeah,
and I mean Dean is just a dean is a 

2678
02:14:30,780 --> 02:14:35,200
mutant and he is a gifted,
incredibly gifted grappler.

2679
02:14:35,920 --> 02:14:36,910
But his,
you know,

2680
02:14:36,940 --> 02:14:41,940
his training methodology and lifestyle 
is not really conducive to a competing 

2681
02:14:44,531 --> 02:14:45,610
like that,
you know,

2682
02:14:46,570 --> 02:14:49,300
unfortunately,
that's a nice way of saying he's kind of

2683
02:14:49,301 --> 02:14:53,510
lazy.
Let's just make those noises.

2684
02:14:54,170 --> 02:14:55,220
Hey,
he,

2685
02:14:55,600 --> 02:14:58,350
he,
he could definitely train harder and uh,

2686
02:14:58,600 --> 02:14:59,080
you know,
I've,

2687
02:14:59,140 --> 02:15:01,500
I've trained with all kinds of guys in 
the world,

2688
02:15:01,550 --> 02:15:06,550
a world class,
guys all over the place and dean is 

2689
02:15:06,550 --> 02:15:07,330
absolutely,
you know,

2690
02:15:07,390 --> 02:15:09,940
one of those guys that is up there with 
like,

2691
02:15:09,941 --> 02:15:14,941
you know,
a Hickson who have trained with 

2692
02:15:14,941 --> 02:15:15,490
Marcello,
but he's like that crazy

2693
02:15:15,540 --> 02:15:16,380
good.
Really?

2694
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:17,690
Wow.
Well,

2695
02:15:17,700 --> 02:15:21,270
I know he was one of the first real leg 
lock masters.

2696
02:15:21,630 --> 02:15:23,010
Really understood like,
and,

2697
02:15:23,020 --> 02:15:25,600
and um,
uh,

2698
02:15:27,530 --> 02:15:32,530
who brought him in to.
I'm into where someone brought him into 

2699
02:15:34,080 --> 02:15:35,640
adcc pride.
No,

2700
02:15:35,641 --> 02:15:38,850
I know he a fuck.
Why am I blanking?

2701
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:42,840
Alan Belcher belcher brought him in when
he fought a WHO's smart,

2702
02:15:43,680 --> 02:15:48,680
who's the best leg locker in mma.
And in that fight Alan just stopped 

2703
02:15:48,680 --> 02:15:53,601
everything Paul Harris threw at him and 
literally meet every single movement 

2704
02:15:53,791 --> 02:15:54,390
that I saw.
I was like,

2705
02:15:54,391 --> 02:15:54,660
oh,
that,

2706
02:15:54,661 --> 02:15:55,080
that's,
that's,

2707
02:15:55,081 --> 02:15:55,470
that's,
that's,

2708
02:15:55,471 --> 02:15:58,170
you know,
like I knew exactly what dean had showed

2709
02:15:58,171 --> 02:15:59,820
him and exactly what those movements 
were.

2710
02:16:00,180 --> 02:16:02,490
That's amazing.
What does Dean doing these days?

2711
02:16:02,491 --> 02:16:05,160
Is he going to still compete or he's,
you know,

2712
02:16:05,161 --> 02:16:06,100
he's teaching Jujitsu

2713
02:16:06,310 --> 02:16:07,450
and,
you know,

2714
02:16:07,480 --> 02:16:10,390
hanging out.
I'm getting after it,

2715
02:16:11,260 --> 02:16:12,420
you know.
Uh,

2716
02:16:12,430 --> 02:16:17,350
I would love to see him just like get 
completely refocused and make a,

2717
02:16:17,380 --> 02:16:20,890
make a run at when an atcc or whatever.
Uh,

2718
02:16:21,250 --> 02:16:24,400
one more time before he,
before he hangs it up.

2719
02:16:24,730 --> 02:16:27,040
But when you say is dinged up,
like what kind of Shit?

2720
02:16:27,350 --> 02:16:28,710
Just normal old,
you know,

2721
02:16:28,780 --> 02:16:29,830
Jujitsu Guy,
you know,

2722
02:16:29,831 --> 02:16:31,360
he's,
his neck will be sore shoulder,

2723
02:16:31,361 --> 02:16:32,860
will be heard,
uh,

2724
02:16:33,190 --> 02:16:34,870
just that kind of stuff,
you know.

2725
02:16:35,170 --> 02:16:35,680
But,
but,

2726
02:16:35,681 --> 02:16:36,580
you know,
he is a mutant.

2727
02:16:36,690 --> 02:16:39,030
He is a mutant that could,
you know,

2728
02:16:39,031 --> 02:16:39,760
if I think,
uh,

2729
02:16:40,440 --> 02:16:42,820
he,
he in adcc his last,

2730
02:16:42,821 --> 02:16:47,821
I think it was in China,
his match against Buccella when we 

2731
02:16:47,821 --> 02:16:48,880
churches just a complete beast and you 
know,

2732
02:16:48,881 --> 02:16:51,340
they went at it and that was a very 
close match.

2733
02:16:51,341 --> 02:16:56,341
And again,
if you watch training videos of 

2734
02:16:56,341 --> 02:16:59,560
[inaudible] getting ready for ADCC,
he's training like a complete savage.

2735
02:16:59,560 --> 02:17:01,090
I mean,
he's bringing wrestlers in,

2736
02:17:01,270 --> 02:17:03,250
he's clean and jerk,
he's flipping tires,

2737
02:17:03,251 --> 02:17:06,850
he's doing everything that one does to 
prepare for a situation like that.

2738
02:17:07,600 --> 02:17:12,600
And,
and dean does not do those types of 

2739
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:12,600
things,
you know,

2740
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:12,670
okay,
we'll come in and train a little bit and

2741
02:17:12,880 --> 02:17:16,270
go on his natural ability as a mutant 
human being to get it done.

2742
02:17:17,110 --> 02:17:22,110
It's always frustrating when you see a 
guy who is so naturally gifted who kind 

2743
02:17:22,110 --> 02:17:22,840
of like lays back.
But that's,

2744
02:17:23,080 --> 02:17:28,080
it seems to be,
that's a lot of what happens is the 

2745
02:17:28,080 --> 02:17:31,471
people that are naturally gifted don't 
have to work as hard so they don't work 

2746
02:17:31,471 --> 02:17:32,650
as hard.
It's also part of,

2747
02:17:33,360 --> 02:17:35,290
you know,
when I talk about Jeff and dean,

2748
02:17:35,291 --> 02:17:38,080
both those guys,
they're both and you know,

2749
02:17:38,081 --> 02:17:43,081
you could throw Eddie and then you can 
throw all kinds of people into this 

2750
02:17:43,081 --> 02:17:43,090
category who are,
who are,

2751
02:17:43,230 --> 02:17:45,400
uh,
kind of game changers.

2752
02:17:45,430 --> 02:17:46,930
You know what I mean?
Well,

2753
02:17:47,820 --> 02:17:52,820
you know,
I don't know Eddie that well have hung 

2754
02:17:52,820 --> 02:17:55,261
out a couple of times,
but I definitely know Jeff and dean and 

2755
02:17:55,261 --> 02:17:57,520
there they got some,
they got some,

2756
02:17:57,730 --> 02:17:59,470
some weird stuff about them,
right?

2757
02:17:59,471 --> 02:18:04,471
I mean they got some weird personality 
stuff and from my perspective that is,

2758
02:18:06,250 --> 02:18:11,250
you know,
know if you didn't have that weird 

2759
02:18:11,250 --> 02:18:11,250
personality thing than how are you going
to be,

2760
02:18:11,250 --> 02:18:13,060
you know,
a 15 year old Jeff Glover and be like,

2761
02:18:13,240 --> 02:18:14,230
Oh,
you know what I'm going to do all day.

2762
02:18:14,260 --> 02:18:15,700
I'm just going to train Jujitsu all day.
Every day.

2763
02:18:15,970 --> 02:18:17,830
I'm going to sit there.
I'm gonna watch the youtube videos.

2764
02:18:17,831 --> 02:18:19,360
I'm just going to get good at this.
I'm going to train everyday.

2765
02:18:19,530 --> 02:18:21,220
I'm going to compete all over the 
country.

2766
02:18:21,370 --> 02:18:22,510
I'm just,
that's what I'm going to do.

2767
02:18:22,720 --> 02:18:23,520
That's,
you know,

2768
02:18:23,530 --> 02:18:25,480
if you're not some.
If you don't have some,

2769
02:18:25,510 --> 02:18:30,510
if you're normal,
you're not going to do that on normal 

2770
02:18:30,510 --> 02:18:30,510
person's like,
oh cool,

2771
02:18:30,510 --> 02:18:30,570
I'm going to get a job at Walmart and 
then I'm going to do it.

2772
02:18:30,670 --> 02:18:31,410
You know,
I'll train it.

2773
02:18:31,540 --> 02:18:33,370
I'll train for an hour and half night.
These guys were like,

2774
02:18:33,371 --> 02:18:33,670
oh no,
no,

2775
02:18:33,671 --> 02:18:36,220
I'm just going to train all day everyday
and I'm going to live in,

2776
02:18:36,221 --> 02:18:38,200
you know,
on the mat and dean,

2777
02:18:38,201 --> 02:18:43,201
same way.
Like if he didn't have that weird like 

2778
02:18:43,201 --> 02:18:44,740
spark that made him,
that makes him.

2779
02:18:44,890 --> 02:18:48,820
I mean,
he's got some weird like knowledge.

2780
02:18:49,060 --> 02:18:52,990
What's weird about him is if you ask 
Eddie Bravo about,

2781
02:18:53,230 --> 02:18:54,190
you know,
the rubber guard,

2782
02:18:54,191 --> 02:18:58,370
he knows all this details about it,
but if you ask them about a full lock or

2783
02:18:58,371 --> 02:19:03,371
what,
something that he doesn't know that 

2784
02:19:03,371 --> 02:19:03,371
well,
he'd be like,

2785
02:19:03,371 --> 02:19:03,371
Oh yeah,
a little bit.

2786
02:19:03,371 --> 02:19:04,150
You'll ask Dean about something that he 
knows nothing like you've never seen him

2787
02:19:04,151 --> 02:19:06,460
do before.
And he'll know all these detailed of the

2788
02:19:06,461 --> 02:19:11,461
moves and I don't know if he,
I seriously don't know if he goes and 

2789
02:19:11,461 --> 02:19:11,950
watches it on youtube or if he like 
studies or write it down,

2790
02:19:11,951 --> 02:19:15,430
but he's got this weird little almost 
rain man.

2791
02:19:15,700 --> 02:19:17,230
I'm,
you know,

2792
02:19:17,231 --> 02:19:20,320
idiot savant type.
Weird thing in his head.

2793
02:19:20,710 --> 02:19:24,490
He was one of those guys that had a 
really hard time transitioning into mma.

2794
02:19:24,640 --> 02:19:28,250
Absolutely.
His striking just never seemed

2795
02:19:28,400 --> 02:19:29,680
fluid.
Like,

2796
02:19:29,750 --> 02:19:31,910
and he,
I know he worked hard at it.

2797
02:19:32,270 --> 02:19:37,270
He just,
for whatever his body is designed for 

2798
02:19:37,270 --> 02:19:37,270
trap things.
Yeah.

2799
02:19:37,580 --> 02:19:42,580
And you see that with everybody because 
everyone's got strengths and weaknesses 

2800
02:19:42,580 --> 02:19:43,670
and everyone's going to be good at 
something and bad at something else.

2801
02:19:43,720 --> 02:19:44,840
Uh,
you know,

2802
02:19:44,841 --> 02:19:47,270
you and I know all of these examples of 
people that are like this.

2803
02:19:47,271 --> 02:19:47,950
Every fighter,
you know,

2804
02:19:47,980 --> 02:19:52,980
he's got some weak area and then you get
occasionally get a guy that liked gsp 

2805
02:19:52,980 --> 02:19:53,420
that's just like,
well rounded.

2806
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:55,400
Um,
but you know,

2807
02:19:55,401 --> 02:19:57,020
everyone,
even even things,

2808
02:19:57,050 --> 02:19:59,000
physical things,
physical attributes,

2809
02:19:59,001 --> 02:20:01,580
you know,
some people are just super mutant strong

2810
02:20:01,970 --> 02:20:06,970
and some people are just super crazy 
flexible and some people have 

2811
02:20:06,970 --> 02:20:08,840
unbelievable natural cardio and some 
people don't.

2812
02:20:09,620 --> 02:20:12,920
And so it's the people.
Then there's some people that are really

2813
02:20:12,921 --> 02:20:17,921
good at grappling.
There's some people are really good at 

2814
02:20:17,921 --> 02:20:17,921
striking.

2815
02:20:17,921 --> 02:20:18,020
There are some people that are good at 
putting all those things together,

2816
02:20:18,021 --> 02:20:23,021
which I always thought fader was very 
natural at combining his striking with 

2817
02:20:23,021 --> 02:20:27,041
his grappling and kind of making it all 
fit together better than most people 

2818
02:20:27,041 --> 02:20:27,420
could.
Um,

2819
02:20:27,640 --> 02:20:28,760
yeah,
I agree with you on that.

2820
02:20:28,761 --> 02:20:33,761
I think that was one of the things that 
really stood out about him was that he 

2821
02:20:33,761 --> 02:20:37,061
didn't fall into that trap that a lot of
people do where if you're a really good 

2822
02:20:37,191 --> 02:20:42,191
wrestler but you have knockout power,
you just knock everybody out fade or he 

2823
02:20:42,191 --> 02:20:46,601
would be.
You'd be stunned and he would see your 

2824
02:20:46,601 --> 02:20:46,601
arm and he would dive into Kimora,
you know,

2825
02:20:46,601 --> 02:20:50,891
he would.
He would always take the opportunity 

2826
02:20:50,891 --> 02:20:53,951
that presented itself,
whether it was a grappling situation 

2827
02:20:53,951 --> 02:20:56,801
where there was a striking situation and
his well-roundedness was one of the 

2828
02:20:56,801 --> 02:20:58,700
things that made him special on top of 
his knockout power and his aggression,

2829
02:20:58,970 --> 02:20:59,240
his.

2830
02:20:59,270 --> 02:21:04,270
He was so well rounded who was his 
ability to flow with whatever was 

2831
02:21:04,270 --> 02:21:08,531
happening and he also had that Hump 
Humility and he had that calm like you,

2832
02:21:09,020 --> 02:21:11,270
like you saw holly had the other day and
I actually,

2833
02:21:11,390 --> 02:21:12,920
I actually,
again talking about social media.

2834
02:21:12,921 --> 02:21:17,921
I posted,
I haven't posted much on facebook the 

2835
02:21:17,921 --> 02:21:20,231
facebook before,
but there's a video of holly talking 

2836
02:21:20,231 --> 02:21:24,400
about.
She got beat by Sophia Mathias in 

2837
02:21:24,710 --> 02:21:27,650
kickboxing.
It was a vicious fight.

2838
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:29,390
Watch it,
laser kickboxing and boxing,

2839
02:21:29,420 --> 02:21:30,350
kickboxing.
It's,

2840
02:21:30,480 --> 02:21:31,170
it's,
it's,

2841
02:21:31,270 --> 02:21:32,750
it's insane.
I mean,

2842
02:21:32,751 --> 02:21:37,751
she gets destroyed.
Holly gets completely destroyed hanging 

2843
02:21:37,751 --> 02:21:38,210
on the ropes,
getting punched in the head.

2844
02:21:38,510 --> 02:21:43,510
It's awful.
Then you watch the post fight interview 

2845
02:21:43,510 --> 02:21:44,640
with her and it,
it.

2846
02:21:44,760 --> 02:21:49,760
It's unbelievable because everything she
says she takes complete ownership of the

2847
02:21:52,281 --> 02:21:53,750
loss.
She's like,

2848
02:21:53,870 --> 02:21:56,420
I had a great training camp.
I,

2849
02:21:56,510 --> 02:21:58,280
my coaches were telling me to do the 
right things,

2850
02:21:58,281 --> 02:22:00,020
but I wasn't doing what I was supposed 
to do.

2851
02:22:00,021 --> 02:22:01,700
I wasn't fighting the way I was supposed
to fight.

2852
02:22:02,030 --> 02:22:07,030
The reason I last night is my fault.
I did this and I will have to change 

2853
02:22:07,030 --> 02:22:11,540
things if I'm going to beat her and 
hearing someone.

2854
02:22:11,780 --> 02:22:15,650
And the other part that was cool about 
it was she was getting emotional,

2855
02:22:16,180 --> 02:22:17,570
like you could see like she wanted to 
cry.

2856
02:22:17,571 --> 02:22:19,400
I mean she was crushed,
but she,

2857
02:22:19,430 --> 02:22:23,610
she kept control of her emotions and was
another one.

2858
02:22:23,630 --> 02:22:24,440
I saw that video.
I'm like,

2859
02:22:24,441 --> 02:22:25,320
man,
this girl is,

2860
02:22:25,380 --> 02:22:25,800
is

2861
02:22:26,220 --> 02:22:28,260
going to do going to do well in this 
fight.

2862
02:22:28,261 --> 02:22:28,590
I mean,
I,

2863
02:22:28,591 --> 02:22:30,150
I,
I had a pretty good feeling about it.

2864
02:22:30,630 --> 02:22:31,200
Well,
she's,

2865
02:22:31,470 --> 02:22:33,660
she is incredibly solid,
that's for sure.

2866
02:22:33,661 --> 02:22:37,920
And that is so admirable when someone 
does take ownership of their mistakes.

2867
02:22:38,310 --> 02:22:40,590
So important,
so important.

2868
02:22:40,591 --> 02:22:43,530
That's like we wrote the book,
the book is called extreme ownership,

2869
02:22:43,531 --> 02:22:46,470
that that's literally the time ladies 
and gentlemen right there.

2870
02:22:46,810 --> 02:22:47,540
But,
but that's,

2871
02:22:47,580 --> 02:22:52,580
that is like the key though.
The reason it's called that is because 

2872
02:22:52,580 --> 02:22:57,500
when we made mistakes,
we owned up to him and furthermore when 

2873
02:22:57,900 --> 02:23:00,810
both Lafe and I ended up in positions 
where we were teaching leadership,

2874
02:23:00,811 --> 02:23:05,811
lead life was teaching the junior 
officers that were coming out of the 

2875
02:23:05,811 --> 02:23:08,541
seal training,
putting them through the junior officer 

2876
02:23:08,541 --> 02:23:08,541
training course and I was teaching,
like I said,

2877
02:23:08,541 --> 02:23:11,910
the advanced guys and so you'd get to 
seal officers and like I said,

2878
02:23:11,911 --> 02:23:16,911
we put these guys through horrible 
training scenarios where everyone was 

2879
02:23:16,911 --> 02:23:20,001
getting killed and blown up and they'd 
be bought buddy carrying people through 

2880
02:23:20,001 --> 02:23:20,970
the desert and just,
it's just awful.

2881
02:23:21,720 --> 02:23:25,410
And you come back from these situations 
and you talked to one of the,

2882
02:23:25,470 --> 02:23:28,390
let's say one of the good leaders and 
you'd say,

2883
02:23:28,391 --> 02:23:29,100
Hey,
what went wrong?

2884
02:23:29,310 --> 02:23:30,330
And the guides say,
well,

2885
02:23:30,810 --> 02:23:34,020
number one,
I didn't give a clear enough plan.

2886
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:36,420
No one really understood what my vision 
was.

2887
02:23:36,570 --> 02:23:41,570
They didn't execute because I obviously 
didn't give them a good enough briefing 

2888
02:23:41,570 --> 02:23:42,900
and you'd be like,
okay,

2889
02:23:42,960 --> 02:23:47,960
fair enough,
and that guy would go and fix that 

2890
02:23:47,960 --> 02:23:50,211
problem.
Then you get a guy that was would not 

2891
02:23:50,211 --> 02:23:50,730
take ownership of stuff that would come 
in and say,

2892
02:23:51,390 --> 02:23:53,380
a user say,
well,

2893
02:23:53,400 --> 02:23:55,250
what went wrong?
That training that was,

2894
02:23:55,470 --> 02:23:56,910
you guys did a terrible job.
What happened?

2895
02:23:56,911 --> 02:23:57,630
He said,
well,

2896
02:23:58,050 --> 02:23:58,530
you know,
my,

2897
02:23:58,560 --> 02:24:03,560
my assault force commander didn't wait 
for my command before he left and he 

2898
02:24:03,560 --> 02:24:07,731
screwed up and my platoon chief wasn't 
heads up about where our casualties were

2899
02:24:08,011 --> 02:24:11,760
being taken and my Lpo and they'd make 
all these excuses.

2900
02:24:12,890 --> 02:24:17,890
And it really was the difference between
like who would be successful and who 

2901
02:24:17,890 --> 02:24:21,261
wouldn't be.
Because the guy that takes ownership of 

2902
02:24:21,261 --> 02:24:24,051
the problems,
what do you think the rest of his team 

2903
02:24:24,051 --> 02:24:24,051
does?
Just just,

2904
02:24:24,051 --> 02:24:29,050
if,
if that person takes ownership of the 

2905
02:24:29,050 --> 02:24:31,431
problems,
everybody on that team does the same 

2906
02:24:31,431 --> 02:24:31,431
thing.
They don't say,

2907
02:24:31,431 --> 02:24:31,431
yeah,
you're right boss.

2908
02:24:31,431 --> 02:24:31,440
It is your fault.
No,

2909
02:24:31,441 --> 02:24:32,310
they go,
hey boss,

2910
02:24:32,311 --> 02:24:37,311
you know what,
I actually could have done a better job 

2911
02:24:37,311 --> 02:24:40,160
and and that spreads through everybody.
Whereas when someone says it wasn't my 

2912
02:24:40,471 --> 02:24:41,370
fault,
it was joe's fault,

2913
02:24:41,371 --> 02:24:42,960
what does Joe do?
Joe Goes,

2914
02:24:42,990 --> 02:24:44,690
no,
that wasn't mine because I'm not getting

2915
02:24:44,691 --> 02:24:46,020
no blame each other,
and guess what?

2916
02:24:46,021 --> 02:24:48,480
The problem never gets lost.
Exactly.

2917
02:24:48,720 --> 02:24:53,720
So to hear holly talking about that 
after the fight and taking complete 

2918
02:24:53,720 --> 02:24:57,651
ownership of a loss was very impressive 
to me and then she went on to beat her 

2919
02:24:57,651 --> 02:24:58,330
like six months later.
Unbelief.

2920
02:24:58,420 --> 02:24:59,450
Yeah.
Yeah.

2921
02:24:59,730 --> 02:25:04,730
It's one of the most important things in
getting good at anything is recognizing 

2922
02:25:04,730 --> 02:25:06,840
when you're not good.
Recognizing when you make mistakes.

2923
02:25:07,770 --> 02:25:09,390
It seems so simple.
Right?

2924
02:25:09,391 --> 02:25:12,000
But you know why?
Because Ego.

2925
02:25:12,030 --> 02:25:12,700
No,
he goes,

2926
02:25:12,970 --> 02:25:16,400
everybody's ego.
It's like even even me,

2927
02:25:16,401 --> 02:25:18,540
because I sit here,
in fact I teach people about,

2928
02:25:18,550 --> 02:25:23,550
you know,
you've got to keep your ego and there's 

2929
02:25:23,550 --> 02:25:23,550
a chapter in there like you've got to 
keep your ego in check.

2930
02:25:23,550 --> 02:25:23,550
When,
when,

2931
02:25:23,550 --> 02:25:24,010
when somebody,
I'll ask somebody,

2932
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:24,640
I'll be like,
hey,

2933
02:25:24,641 --> 02:25:25,960
is there anything I could have done 
better in that,

2934
02:25:25,961 --> 02:25:29,200
in that speech or in that class?
And they'll be like,

2935
02:25:29,590 --> 02:25:29,980
well,
you know,

2936
02:25:29,981 --> 02:25:31,080
one thing that you could do,
and I'm like,

2937
02:25:31,090 --> 02:25:33,540
immediately I'm like for wrestling,
wrestling,

2938
02:25:33,541 --> 02:25:34,980
like my ego.
I'm like,

2939
02:25:34,981 --> 02:25:36,340
God,
I'm such a loser.

2940
02:25:36,940 --> 02:25:39,810
I'm sitting here telling them about 
their ego in check.

2941
02:25:39,820 --> 02:25:44,140
And so everybody does that.
Everybody does it all the time.

2942
02:25:44,141 --> 02:25:49,141
No one can take criticism and you know,
part of that biggest step of moving 

2943
02:25:49,141 --> 02:25:53,521
forward is a is,
is learning how to take ownership of 

2944
02:25:53,521 --> 02:25:53,740
stuff and when it goes sideways and it 
definitely will.

2945
02:25:53,980 --> 02:25:58,980
Well you need some form,
some amount of pride and some amount of 

2946
02:25:58,980 --> 02:26:02,880
ego to get good at things in the first 
place because it's such a cow 

2947
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:06,040
counterintuitive notion because you have
to have a belief in yourself.

2948
02:26:06,041 --> 02:26:07,600
You have to be able,
like when you,

2949
02:26:07,660 --> 02:26:09,450
when you first,
when you start out at Jujitsu,

2950
02:26:09,460 --> 02:26:10,180
your white belt.

2951
02:26:10,580 --> 02:26:12,490
I remember being a white belt and being 
like,

2952
02:26:12,520 --> 02:26:17,520
oh my God,
I am fucking never going to get good at 

2953
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:17,520
this.
I'm going to suck forever,

2954
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:20,380
but to to to look at people who are 
better than you and no,

2955
02:26:20,720 --> 02:26:22,780
they had to have sucked at one point in 
time.

2956
02:26:22,781 --> 02:26:25,720
Okay.
There's gotta be somewhere along the end

2957
02:26:25,721 --> 02:26:27,550
of this tunnel.
There's got to be a light.

2958
02:26:27,551 --> 02:26:32,300
I just gotTa keep going and Tigo Ego was
going to say,

2959
02:26:32,301 --> 02:26:36,640
I mean,
ego drives you to be successful me to be

2960
02:26:36,641 --> 02:26:37,980
successful.
Egos.

2961
02:26:37,990 --> 02:26:42,990
What's driving you?
The problem is when you let ego go too 

2962
02:26:42,990 --> 02:26:42,990
far and you know everything,
you know,

2963
02:26:42,990 --> 02:26:45,160
everything takes balance.
This is a dichotomy and everything,

2964
02:26:45,400 --> 02:26:47,710
every part of you has a dichotomy.
You know,

2965
02:26:47,711 --> 02:26:52,711
you can get so into the physical aspects
of things that you end up like doing a 

2966
02:26:52,711 --> 02:26:54,820
bunch of steroids and going crazy and 
ruining your health.

2967
02:26:55,320 --> 02:26:58,420
That's not good.
The other end of the spectrum,

2968
02:26:58,421 --> 02:27:03,421
you know,
you can sit around and play video games 

2969
02:27:03,421 --> 02:27:03,421
and turned into A.
Yeah,

2970
02:27:03,421 --> 02:27:03,610
yeah.
Well,

2971
02:27:03,611 --> 02:27:04,360
there,
there's,

2972
02:27:04,470 --> 02:27:09,470
yeah.
Bodybuilding is the best example of 

2973
02:27:09,470 --> 02:27:09,470
that,
right?

2974
02:27:09,470 --> 02:27:10,420
Because yeah,
that's kind of dying out though,

2975
02:27:10,421 --> 02:27:11,450
isn't it?
Kind of bonded.

2976
02:27:11,490 --> 02:27:15,670
Building out their stuff to you and I.
It is,

2977
02:27:15,850 --> 02:27:20,850
but I think there's a giant culture of 
people out there that want to look like 

2978
02:27:20,850 --> 02:27:21,940
huge mutant still.
It's,

2979
02:27:22,030 --> 02:27:24,160
I think,
I mean I'm not in that world,

2980
02:27:24,161 --> 02:27:27,640
but when.
I mean a bodybuilding is a great example

2981
02:27:27,641 --> 02:27:30,310
of that because when you start lifting 
weights like,

2982
02:27:30,311 --> 02:27:35,311
God,
I'd like to be stronger and you start 

2983
02:27:35,311 --> 02:27:35,311
getting a little bit bigger.
You're like,

2984
02:27:35,311 --> 02:27:35,311
oh look at that.
I got a muscle,

2985
02:27:35,311 --> 02:27:35,590
Ooh,
this is cool,

2986
02:27:35,740 --> 02:27:37,630
and then you keep going and then you 
keep going.

2987
02:27:37,930 --> 02:27:40,480
But some guys get so fucking crazy.

2988
02:27:40,480 --> 02:27:45,480
They won't stop until they have 22 inch 
arms and they want to have thighs that 

2989
02:27:45,480 --> 02:27:46,360
are so big.
They have to walk like they're,

2990
02:27:46,510 --> 02:27:48,700
they've got a barrel in between their 
legs and you know,

2991
02:27:48,880 --> 02:27:53,880
and they,
they just can't help but they just take 

2992
02:27:53,880 --> 02:27:53,880
it to some completely unhealthy place.
Yeah,

2993
02:27:53,880 --> 02:27:55,240
that's a,
that's rough.

2994
02:27:55,510 --> 02:27:55,960
Yeah.
Well,

2995
02:27:55,961 --> 02:27:59,470
it's just the nature of trying to get 
good at something.

2996
02:27:59,680 --> 02:28:03,640
You've got to recognize what's good and 
what is just fucking insane.

2997
02:28:03,641 --> 02:28:08,641
Yeah.
And it happens in training camps with 

2998
02:28:08,641 --> 02:28:08,641
fighters all the time to retrain.
So bad,

2999
02:28:08,641 --> 02:28:12,130
big part of the problem with a mixed 
martial arts,

3000
02:28:12,131 --> 02:28:17,131
so obvious too,
when you're overtraining somebody 

3001
02:28:17,131 --> 02:28:19,770
because all of the sudden like one night
they'll just fall apart and they just 

3002
02:28:19,770 --> 02:28:19,770
won't be able to do anything.
Right.

3003
02:28:19,770 --> 02:28:19,770
And I'm always like,
all right,

3004
02:28:19,770 --> 02:28:23,210
go eat two steaks and take two off 
because they will get to a point.

3005
02:28:23,210 --> 02:28:25,130
You just feel them.
You'll just feel and fall apart.

3006
02:28:25,160 --> 02:28:27,230
Yeah,
but you have to monitor your heart rate.

3007
02:28:27,231 --> 02:28:29,480
That's a big thing that a lot of 
fighters don't do.

3008
02:28:29,690 --> 02:28:33,380
Monitor your resting heart rate in the 
morning and if it goes up more than five

3009
02:28:33,381 --> 02:28:38,381
beats in a day or two,
most likely year overtrained or you're 

3010
02:28:38,381 --> 02:28:40,820
sick or you're struggling with something
that would make.

3011
02:28:40,821 --> 02:28:43,160
Steve Maxwell taught me that trick.
He's like,

3012
02:28:43,161 --> 02:28:45,170
every fighter should do that.
And none of them do.

3013
02:28:45,500 --> 02:28:50,500
They should monitor their heart rate and
every morning his heart rate is like 

3014
02:28:50,500 --> 02:28:52,820
seven.
Steve Maxwell can fucking.

3015
02:28:52,850 --> 02:28:55,490
He can deal with anything.
He's just one of those dudes,

3016
02:28:55,550 --> 02:28:57,080
but he's just.
He's another guy I want to talk about.

3017
02:28:57,081 --> 02:29:02,081
A guy who's got a lifetime of wisdom 
comes to strength and conditioning and 

3018
02:29:02,081 --> 02:29:05,180
what he calls physical culture and the 
culture of taking care of your body.

3019
02:29:05,810 --> 02:29:08,960
Guys.
Sixty two or 63 years old,

3020
02:29:09,110 --> 02:29:11,240
fit as a fiddle,
travels all around the world,

3021
02:29:11,241 --> 02:29:12,590
training people.
That's all he does.

3022
02:29:12,730 --> 02:29:14,310
It doesn't have a house,
doesn't.

3023
02:29:14,420 --> 02:29:19,420
He has a.
A bag that he brings with him when he 

3024
02:29:19,420 --> 02:29:20,090
travels around.
All of this stuff's in that bag.

3025
02:29:20,660 --> 02:29:24,410
I ran into her in San Diego because he's
been downsizing and when I.

3026
02:29:24,470 --> 02:29:26,660
The first time I ran into him in San 
Diego,

3027
02:29:26,720 --> 02:29:31,720
he was down to living in an rv.
That's when I first met him.

3028
02:29:32,840 --> 02:29:34,760
I hear him on a podcast,
whatever,

3029
02:29:34,761 --> 02:29:37,190
you know,
a year later or two years later and he's

3030
02:29:37,310 --> 02:29:39,620
not have all my worldly possessions in a
backpack.

3031
02:29:39,650 --> 02:29:42,170
Yeah.
He sold his rv and he's like,

3032
02:29:42,171 --> 02:29:47,171
fuck it.
I don't even know if he has a bank 

3033
02:29:47,171 --> 02:29:47,171
account.
I mean,

3034
02:29:47,171 --> 02:29:47,300
just.
He's a strange cat man.

3035
02:29:47,750 --> 02:29:52,010
He really is a strange cat,
but a very at peace guy for sure.

3036
02:29:52,070 --> 02:29:52,450
Yeah.
I mean,

3037
02:29:52,540 --> 02:29:54,800
it's very interesting.
I wouldn't want to live like that.

3038
02:29:54,950 --> 02:29:59,950
I don't like living like that,
but he's also been the guy that's lived 

3039
02:29:59,950 --> 02:30:00,170
the other way.
He's had the house and needs that.

3040
02:30:00,171 --> 02:30:05,171
The family and his son Zack is a very 
successful Jujitsu competitor and you 

3041
02:30:05,561 --> 02:30:07,550
know,
got divorced and gave up the gym.

3042
02:30:07,551 --> 02:30:08,420
He had the,
all the,

3043
02:30:08,510 --> 02:30:10,130
all the trappings.
He had everything.

3044
02:30:10,131 --> 02:30:10,660
He was like,
Ooh,

3045
02:30:10,820 --> 02:30:12,890
I like it better.
Like this backpack.

3046
02:30:13,070 --> 02:30:18,070
Maybe the key word there was trapping.
Maybe he somehow built all these things 

3047
02:30:18,070 --> 02:30:20,780
around them that felt.
Ended up making them feel trapped.

3048
02:30:20,870 --> 02:30:22,700
Yeah.
For him it's just he would.

3049
02:30:22,701 --> 02:30:25,160
He figured out what he enjoys.
He enjoys training,

3050
02:30:25,210 --> 02:30:28,490
still doing Jujitsu to this day and he 
teaches a course,

3051
02:30:28,520 --> 02:30:33,520
a Jujitsu for lifetime and it's all 
about maintaining your health while you 

3052
02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:36,170
train and you know,
he's written articles on training,

3053
02:30:36,171 --> 02:30:41,171
smart to avoid injuries as you get older
and you know how to pick the right 

3054
02:30:41,171 --> 02:30:42,210
training partners and make sure you 
know,

3055
02:30:42,250 --> 02:30:43,580
you know,
nobody's trying to hurt you,

3056
02:30:43,581 --> 02:30:48,581
but you could keep a,
an active martial arts lifestyle deep 

3057
02:30:48,581 --> 02:30:49,250
into your sixties like he is.

3058
02:30:49,600 --> 02:30:54,600
Yeah.
You got to be thankful that you started 

3059
02:30:54,600 --> 02:30:54,600
Jujitsu a little bit younger because you
got to get in.

3060
02:30:54,600 --> 02:30:55,550
Even today,
if you start.

3061
02:30:55,551 --> 02:31:00,551
Jujitsu is an older thing.
We have all kinds of older guys come 

3062
02:31:00,551 --> 02:31:03,001
into the gym and it's that first like 
year where they just don't know where to

3063
02:31:04,521 --> 02:31:07,310
put their body yet and they don't 
notice.

3064
02:31:07,340 --> 02:31:12,340
They don't know to say no to that 21 
year old juiced up marine that's like in

3065
02:31:15,381 --> 02:31:18,800
there to get after it.
Like they smack hands to roll in.

3066
02:31:18,801 --> 02:31:21,210
This guy's gonna tear them apart and 
that's,

3067
02:31:21,230 --> 02:31:22,410
that's how guys get hurt.
If they're,

3068
02:31:22,411 --> 02:31:25,920
if they're older and you know they need 
to ease into it a little bit.

3069
02:31:26,080 --> 02:31:31,080
Pick training partners carefully.
Got To pick your training partners 

3070
02:31:31,080 --> 02:31:31,920
carefully and there's always gonna be 
the guy that hurts people.

3071
02:31:31,960 --> 02:31:34,500
There was just this giant German dude 
that used to roll it.

3072
02:31:34,500 --> 02:31:39,500
Our gym is to always get everybody in 
leg locks and blow their knees out and 

3073
02:31:39,500 --> 02:31:41,460
he's just never rolled with that guy.
I'm like,

3074
02:31:42,160 --> 02:31:44,670
I've,
I've been leg locked by dean on.

3075
02:31:44,700 --> 02:31:45,690
You know,
how many times,

3076
02:31:45,691 --> 02:31:47,190
like,
I mean,

3077
02:31:47,191 --> 02:31:50,610
we might be talking thousands of times a
heel hook,

3078
02:31:50,670 --> 02:31:52,080
knee locked,
but you know,

3079
02:31:52,410 --> 02:31:53,520
I've never been hurt,
you know,

3080
02:31:53,550 --> 02:31:55,050
and I've,
I've gotten him,

3081
02:31:55,310 --> 02:32:00,310
you know,
not thousand signs with plenty of times 

3082
02:32:00,310 --> 02:32:00,310
and we've never heard each other,
you know,

3083
02:32:00,310 --> 02:32:01,020
because we,
we know what we're doing.

3084
02:32:01,140 --> 02:32:06,140
Yeah,
I'd way rather roll with a black belt 

3085
02:32:06,140 --> 02:32:06,420
for sure.
Then some fucking psycho blue belt.

3086
02:32:08,390 --> 02:32:10,860
It's just too dangerous.
Sometimes they just,

3087
02:32:11,180 --> 02:32:16,180
they spazz out and they head,
but you accidentally and weird shit 

3088
02:32:16,180 --> 02:32:16,180
happens.
It's,

3089
02:32:16,180 --> 02:32:17,580
um,
I'm.

3090
02:32:17,670 --> 02:32:21,000
One of the things that I think is 
amazing is a,

3091
02:32:21,060 --> 02:32:25,890
that Anthony Bourdain has gotten crazy 
into Jujitsu over the last,

3092
02:32:25,891 --> 02:32:27,030
I think two years now.

3093
02:32:27,030 --> 02:32:29,670
He just earned his blue belt.
He's 59.

3094
02:32:30,090 --> 02:32:30,750
Yeah.
That's awesome.

3095
02:32:30,780 --> 02:32:32,070
What's,
it's amazing.

3096
02:32:32,240 --> 02:32:35,070
He,
he lifetime of smoking cigarettes,

3097
02:32:35,100 --> 02:32:37,230
doing heroin,
like never,

3098
02:32:37,260 --> 02:32:42,260
never was fit,
never exercise at all when I first met 

3099
02:32:42,260 --> 02:32:42,260
him.
Uh,

3100
02:32:42,260 --> 02:32:45,770
like he would laugh about fitness.
He just wanted to drink beer and you 

3101
02:32:45,770 --> 02:32:46,330
know,
he,

3102
02:32:46,400 --> 02:32:48,390
the first time we did my podcast,
we got so high,

3103
02:32:48,391 --> 02:32:50,910
I don't even know how we talk.
And then,

3104
02:32:50,990 --> 02:32:55,990
uh,
I just did a TV show like a couple of 

3105
02:32:55,990 --> 02:32:55,990
weeks ago.
We're in Montana.

3106
02:32:55,990 --> 02:32:58,200
All he wanted to talk about Jujitsu.
He's obsessed.

3107
02:32:58,201 --> 02:33:03,201
I'm showing them some techniques.
We're talking about different guys that 

3108
02:33:03,201 --> 02:33:06,531
liked to do different things at 
different approaches and gay versus no 

3109
02:33:06,531 --> 02:33:06,670
gay.
And John Donner,

3110
02:33:06,671 --> 02:33:11,671
her and you know,
Gary Tone in an Eddy Commons and all 

3111
02:33:11,671 --> 02:33:11,671
these different.
I'm like,

3112
02:33:11,671 --> 02:33:14,250
this is amazing.
I can't believe what a transformation.

3113
02:33:14,251 --> 02:33:16,430
This guy's overtaken Jujitsu.

3114
02:33:16,470 --> 02:33:18,030
Definitely.
I mean,

3115
02:33:18,031 --> 02:33:20,070
people can get into all kinds of weird 
stuff,

3116
02:33:20,071 --> 02:33:21,540
right?
People get into surfing,

3117
02:33:21,541 --> 02:33:24,150
people get into skiing,
people get into rock climbing.

3118
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:29,720
There's definitely something.
I'm more in Jujitsu that gets into 

3119
02:33:31,861 --> 02:33:34,110
people's heads.
And it definitely happened to me.

3120
02:33:34,111 --> 02:33:36,810
I mean,
I was completely and I still am.

3121
02:33:36,811 --> 02:33:40,020
I mean I still cannot stop a youtube 
video of a cool move.

3122
02:33:40,021 --> 02:33:41,640
I mean I just,
I just have to watch it.

3123
02:33:41,670 --> 02:33:46,670
Yeah.
And I think it's because there's such a 

3124
02:33:46,670 --> 02:33:47,820
cerebral part of it,
there's something about it.

3125
02:33:48,150 --> 02:33:53,150
And I see this,
we know we teach kids and you'll see 

3126
02:33:53,150 --> 02:33:53,150
the,
the,

3127
02:33:53,150 --> 02:33:55,470
the knucklehead kids that kind of 
knuckle dragging kids are kind of big.

3128
02:33:56,250 --> 02:33:58,650
They don't really get it.
But then you get this kid,

3129
02:33:58,830 --> 02:34:01,050
some smart kid,
you can tell they're smart and those are

3130
02:34:01,051 --> 02:34:03,810
the kids that get really into Jujitsu 
because they realize like,

3131
02:34:03,840 --> 02:34:05,010
Oh,
if I learned this,

3132
02:34:05,011 --> 02:34:06,270
I can beat that big kid.

3133
02:34:06,370 --> 02:34:08,070
Yeah.
And that's where it starts.

3134
02:34:08,071 --> 02:34:09,930
But yeah,
Jujitsu can definitely be addictive.

3135
02:34:10,020 --> 02:34:15,020
Well,
Jujitsu's the only martial art where it 

3136
02:34:15,020 --> 02:34:17,931
really works,
like in the Bruce Lee movie where the 

3137
02:34:17,931 --> 02:34:20,871
little guy really can beat the big guy 
because the reality is like if you watch

3138
02:34:21,490 --> 02:34:26,490
the old k one days where Bob Sapp was 
fighting when Bob Sapp was 375 pounds 

3139
02:34:29,171 --> 02:34:30,490
with ABS.
Oh,

3140
02:34:30,520 --> 02:34:34,240
you've never seen anything like it.
He was he on steroids.

3141
02:34:34,420 --> 02:34:38,740
He was steroids.
There was nothing human left.

3142
02:34:39,250 --> 02:34:44,250
And he beat or Nesto hoost twice who is 
arguably one of the top two or three 

3143
02:34:46,181 --> 02:34:51,181
greatest kickboxers ever.
And Bob Sapp just bum rushed him and 

3144
02:34:51,700 --> 02:34:56,700
donkey Kong dumb.
Just beat them down with clubbing 

3145
02:34:56,700 --> 02:34:57,310
punches because he was so much bigger 
than him.

3146
02:34:57,550 --> 02:35:00,040
He was more than 150 pounds bigger than 
him probably.

3147
02:35:00,041 --> 02:35:03,190
I think he used it at his biggest.
It's probably like 2:30.

3148
02:35:03,191 --> 02:35:05,740
Maybe to your point,
I was in Japan.

3149
02:35:05,740 --> 02:35:07,060
I was with dean.
As a matter of fact,

3150
02:35:07,061 --> 02:35:09,840
when Nogueira submitted sap,
that was insane.

3151
02:35:09,890 --> 02:35:11,230
That was insane.
That was insane.

3152
02:35:11,260 --> 02:35:13,060
That was a perfect example.
For example,

3153
02:35:13,061 --> 02:35:18,061
a boy,
it had to be Nogueira though because 

3154
02:35:18,061 --> 02:35:18,061
sap,
sap dropped him on his head.

3155
02:35:18,070 --> 02:35:21,910
Pile drived him on his head.
I saw him the next day.

3156
02:35:21,911 --> 02:35:25,420
No Gira,
like after the fight and he was hurt.

3157
02:35:25,510 --> 02:35:27,790
I mean he was up bad.
Oh my God.

3158
02:35:27,791 --> 02:35:28,990
It looks.
I'm a big neck.

3159
02:35:28,991 --> 02:35:31,470
Was fucked up apparently forever.
After that I,

3160
02:35:31,540 --> 02:35:34,570
he hit his neck essentially.
Never recovered after that fight,

3161
02:35:34,750 --> 02:35:39,750
you know,
that was one of the fights that fate or 

3162
02:35:39,750 --> 02:35:39,750
passed on fader wouldn't fight Bob's 
out.

3163
02:35:39,750 --> 02:35:40,090
It was like,
Eh,

3164
02:35:40,290 --> 02:35:44,250
you can take your fucking clown show,
take your circus act and no heroes.

3165
02:35:44,490 --> 02:35:46,810
Okay.
Fader was like,

3166
02:35:46,840 --> 02:35:49,630
no thanks on the freak show.
But then again,

3167
02:35:49,631 --> 02:35:53,050
he went and fought troy who's a giant 
guy too,

3168
02:35:53,051 --> 02:35:58,051
but giant actually gigantism giant,
not giant like juice to the gills giant.

3169
02:36:00,160 --> 02:36:01,400
But look,
Bob Sat,

3170
02:36:01,500 --> 02:36:05,470
I mean all power to them.
They didn't have a law against it and he

3171
02:36:05,471 --> 02:36:10,471
went in there and they were paying them 
and that's how he made a ton of money 

3172
02:36:10,471 --> 02:36:11,350
doing that.
But the point is that in Jujitsu,

3173
02:36:11,650 --> 02:36:16,650
like maybe an MMA,
it's a little bit different because you 

3174
02:36:16,650 --> 02:36:19,370
know,
obviously Bob Sapp Drop Nogueira on his 

3175
02:36:19,370 --> 02:36:19,370
head and most people would have been 
done then,

3176
02:36:19,370 --> 02:36:23,670
but Nogueira was legendarily tough,
but a small man can tap out a much 

3177
02:36:23,981 --> 02:36:26,890
larger,
stronger man on a regular basis.

3178
02:36:27,130 --> 02:36:30,940
I watched Rigo Rodriguez in Abu Dhabi go
against Marcello Garcia.

3179
02:36:30,941 --> 02:36:35,770
I was there and were either in La and 
when Rico threw them on his bed,

3180
02:36:35,771 --> 02:36:40,771
when Marcel took Rico's back,
so rico through himself backwards and 

3181
02:36:40,771 --> 02:36:44,821
slammed on top of Martin,
like Marcel was like a backpack on 

3182
02:36:44,821 --> 02:36:46,360
Rico's back.
Rico's like 2:40

3183
02:36:46,361 --> 02:36:51,361
something maybe even heavier through 
himself backwards and landed all his 

3184
02:36:51,361 --> 02:36:54,400
weight on Marcello ourselves.
Shook it off and leg lock them.

3185
02:36:54,420 --> 02:36:56,800
They're incredible,
incredible.

3186
02:36:56,860 --> 02:37:00,910
I mean Marcella was like 160 pounds,
maybe one 70 maybe,

3187
02:37:01,660 --> 02:37:06,660
but just so skilled and so dangerous 
with his Jujitsu that he was the 

3188
02:37:06,660 --> 02:37:08,170
favorite in that,
which is incredible.

3189
02:37:08,320 --> 02:37:13,320
And that's,
that's where I think that addiction 

3190
02:37:13,320 --> 02:37:13,320
comes in because I think it's just a 
cerebral thing where people realize that

3191
02:37:13,320 --> 02:37:14,770
it's like you said,
it's this real force.

3192
02:37:15,200 --> 02:37:16,130
We're now one

3193
02:37:16,130 --> 02:37:17,300
of my,
uh,

3194
02:37:17,580 --> 02:37:18,890
my,
my kid asked me,

3195
02:37:19,070 --> 02:37:20,210
you know,
that movie the incredibles.

3196
02:37:20,370 --> 02:37:21,840
Yes,
there's kid.

3197
02:37:21,880 --> 02:37:23,720
These people have superpowers.
And My,

3198
02:37:23,721 --> 02:37:25,510
uh,
my son asked me a data,

3199
02:37:25,511 --> 02:37:27,240
is there really such a thing as 
superpowers?

3200
02:37:27,380 --> 02:37:32,380
And I'm like,
Jujitsu is definitely a super power.

3201
02:37:33,140 --> 02:37:38,140
You know,
if you remember the days before anybody 

3202
02:37:38,140 --> 02:37:38,560
knew it,
if you need a little tiny bit,

3203
02:37:38,810 --> 02:37:41,090
you were just get viewed.
No one can stop you.

3204
02:37:41,091 --> 02:37:41,620
It was awesome.

3205
02:37:41,860 --> 02:37:46,860
What's also amazing to see the 
progression of Jujitsu in comparison in 

3206
02:37:46,860 --> 02:37:50,761
1993 because the Jujitsu of 1993 was so 
primitive in comparison to what you have

3207
02:37:50,951 --> 02:37:55,951
today.
Like the guys who are winning with 

3208
02:37:55,951 --> 02:37:56,290
Jujitsu.
God though the setups were so obvious,

3209
02:37:56,530 --> 02:38:01,530
you could see the arm bars a mile away.
There was nothing crazy or weird about 

3210
02:38:01,530 --> 02:38:05,671
it.
And you look at that in comparison to 

3211
02:38:05,671 --> 02:38:05,671
today,
like Jacques Array,

3212
02:38:05,671 --> 02:38:07,660
like when Jocko array gets armbars,
it's like a work of art.

3213
02:38:08,050 --> 02:38:08,430
I mean,
you,

3214
02:38:08,431 --> 02:38:10,420
you watch his setups,
you look good,

3215
02:38:10,421 --> 02:38:15,421
Lord.
Like he tapped Chris Kamozi with an arm 

3216
02:38:15,421 --> 02:38:18,310
bar and I've watched the transition,
the way he controlled them on the ground

3217
02:38:18,311 --> 02:38:22,210
and the scrambled to arm bar.
I probably watched it 40 times in a row.

3218
02:38:22,360 --> 02:38:24,040
I just played it back and forth and 
went,

3219
02:38:24,041 --> 02:38:26,710
fuck one more time.
Fuck.

3220
02:38:27,140 --> 02:38:31,120
I needed perfect placement of the Shin,
the knee that pressure,

3221
02:38:31,121 --> 02:38:33,070
the hips,
everything's in place.

3222
02:38:33,220 --> 02:38:35,100
The control of the arm.
And it was a,

3223
02:38:35,110 --> 02:38:37,990
it was a done deal from the moment he 
started his movements.

3224
02:38:38,610 --> 02:38:41,860
Now that to me is like,
that's just as beautiful as any painting

3225
02:38:41,861 --> 02:38:44,110
than anybody's ever made.
There's no doubt.

3226
02:38:44,111 --> 02:38:46,780
One hundred percent is an art to that.
No doubt about it.

3227
02:38:47,050 --> 02:38:48,040
What year did you start?

3228
02:38:49,060 --> 02:38:50,240
Uh,
[inaudible]?

3229
02:38:50,330 --> 02:38:52,020
Ninety two or 93.
Damn.

3230
02:38:52,040 --> 02:38:53,510
You got an early,
got an early.

3231
02:38:53,511 --> 02:38:56,040
Luckily I had a pre UFC.
Yep.

3232
02:38:56,090 --> 02:38:58,610
We,
we knew when we launched that first UFC,

3233
02:38:58,611 --> 02:39:03,611
we all knew while there were stairs,
three or four of us that knew that 

3234
02:39:03,611 --> 02:39:05,180
hoists,
that release Gracie was going to rise.

3235
02:39:06,650 --> 02:39:11,650
That's amazing.
We have this old seal master chief old 

3236
02:39:11,650 --> 02:39:13,640
Vietnam era,
seal master chief named Steve Bailey.

3237
02:39:14,060 --> 02:39:19,060
And he was,
he was like a high level white belt and 

3238
02:39:19,060 --> 02:39:20,730
he had trained with flooring,
gracie up in the garage,

3239
02:39:20,810 --> 02:39:24,950
open torrents.
And so he knew he knew Jujitsu garage,

3240
02:39:24,951 --> 02:39:27,490
the infamous garage,
like the epicenter.

3241
02:39:28,150 --> 02:39:33,150
No kid in America.
But this Guy Steve Bailey had trained 

3242
02:39:33,150 --> 02:39:36,521
there and you know,
one day we were over on deployment over 

3243
02:39:36,521 --> 02:39:36,521
in Guam and he said,
hey,

3244
02:39:36,521 --> 02:39:37,610
who here wants to learn how to fight?
And I'm like,

3245
02:39:37,640 --> 02:39:38,660
Hey,
I want to learn how to fight.

3246
02:39:39,320 --> 02:39:42,140
And he just took us all and just choked 
us all out,

3247
02:39:42,141 --> 02:39:42,800
you know,
I mean like,

3248
02:39:42,801 --> 02:39:43,280
okay,
you,

3249
02:39:43,281 --> 02:39:45,290
you attack me and just chokes on.
I'm like,

3250
02:39:45,291 --> 02:39:50,291
okay,
I'll listen to whatever this guy is 

3251
02:39:50,291 --> 02:39:50,291
saying.
So.

3252
02:39:50,291 --> 02:39:50,291
So he taught us,
you know,

3253
02:39:50,291 --> 02:39:50,300
the basic,
you know,

3254
02:39:50,301 --> 02:39:55,301
like the rear naked choke and the arm 
lock and like the American or something 

3255
02:39:56,181 --> 02:39:56,510
like,
you know,

3256
02:39:56,511 --> 02:40:00,890
we're talking like four or five 
different moves and with those moves,

3257
02:40:00,891 --> 02:40:01,850
like I never,
I,

3258
02:40:01,851 --> 02:40:03,730
I every scrap I'd get into,
you know,

3259
02:40:03,740 --> 02:40:05,990
I just force someone into the rear naked
choke or force them,

3260
02:40:06,140 --> 02:40:09,830
but they had no idea what was happening.
So it was actually amazing.

3261
02:40:10,310 --> 02:40:10,940
But,
uh,

3262
02:40:11,720 --> 02:40:13,470
but again,
I thought at that time that,

3263
02:40:13,920 --> 02:40:14,160
that,

3264
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:18,210
that was Jujitsu like was this finite 
thing a lot of people did.

3265
02:40:18,211 --> 02:40:19,800
Yeah.
And then you realize,

3266
02:40:19,801 --> 02:40:24,801
you know,
that it's completely unending and it 

3267
02:40:24,801 --> 02:40:27,981
changes every day.
John John Machado had a guy that moved 

3268
02:40:27,981 --> 02:40:31,350
to black belt and uh,
he was a very good martial artist.

3269
02:40:31,351 --> 02:40:33,180
He was very physically strong.
This guy,

3270
02:40:33,181 --> 02:40:37,130
he was a big bulky dude,
like a naturally big bone,

3271
02:40:37,131 --> 02:40:42,131
strong guy that gave people a lot of 
problems and then decided like,

3272
02:40:42,600 --> 02:40:45,900
didn't just decide this,
but set it publicly.

3273
02:40:46,140 --> 02:40:50,940
I've learned all I could learn about 
Jujitsu and now I'm going to learn all I

3274
02:40:50,941 --> 02:40:53,370
can learn about Moitai.
And everybody just went,

3275
02:40:53,550 --> 02:40:54,780
oh dude,
we're done with you.

3276
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:55,740
Oh,
it was like,

3277
02:40:55,741 --> 02:41:00,741
it was so ridiculed in the community and
in the people in school that everybody.

3278
02:41:01,231 --> 02:41:03,390
Like I was like a blue belt at the time 
and I was like,

3279
02:41:03,391 --> 02:41:04,890
what the fuck is this guy on?

3280
02:41:05,130 --> 02:41:07,330
Like you learned everything.
How can you learn every.

3281
02:41:07,331 --> 02:41:09,690
There's no end.
Jujitsu doesn't end.

3282
02:41:10,020 --> 02:41:11,730
It goes on forever.
Like you can't get.

3283
02:41:11,910 --> 02:41:13,740
You can always get better.
It's not,

3284
02:41:13,741 --> 02:41:17,250
it's not something until you achieve the
speed of light.

3285
02:41:18,410 --> 02:41:23,410
And that's another,
another great thing about Jujitsu is 

3286
02:41:23,410 --> 02:41:25,410
because it like combat,
it reflects life.

3287
02:41:25,590 --> 02:41:28,590
End of the day.
You start saying that you're good to go.

3288
02:41:28,591 --> 02:41:33,591
Like in a leadership position or 
whatever task you're working on the day 

3289
02:41:33,591 --> 02:41:37,221
you say,
I've learned everything there is to 

3290
02:41:37,221 --> 02:41:37,221
learn about.
This is the day you start to lose.

3291
02:41:37,221 --> 02:41:41,660
And I know that humility is something 
that you have to keep yourself in check.

3292
02:41:44,400 --> 02:41:46,740
Because again,
I got asked the other day,

3293
02:41:46,741 --> 02:41:47,440
you know,
when were you,

3294
02:41:47,860 --> 02:41:51,150
when was your high point of leadership?
And I'm like,

3295
02:41:51,170 --> 02:41:52,650
no,
I never had high point of leadership.

3296
02:41:52,651 --> 02:41:55,470
I was always trying to learn,
I was always trying to figure out what I

3297
02:41:55,471 --> 02:42:00,060
was doing wrong and what mistakes I was 
making because if you don't do that,

3298
02:42:00,240 --> 02:42:00,480
that's.

3299
02:42:00,730 --> 02:42:02,190
That's something I learned from Jujitsu 
or you know,

3300
02:42:02,191 --> 02:42:07,191
if you don't do that then that you're 
going to get passed by and other people 

3301
02:42:07,191 --> 02:42:11,031
are going to figure something new way of
doing it and you're going to be left in 

3302
02:42:11,031 --> 02:42:11,031
the dark.
Yeah.

3303
02:42:11,031 --> 02:42:13,200
Is much as I like to use,
like the term that was perfect.

3304
02:42:13,201 --> 02:42:15,930
There really is nothing perfect in human
beings.

3305
02:42:15,931 --> 02:42:20,931
There's always room for improvement.
There's always a shorter path is always 

3306
02:42:20,931 --> 02:42:21,030
a quicker victory.
There's always,

3307
02:42:21,300 --> 02:42:26,300
there's always new things to learn and 
as soon as you start thinking that 

3308
02:42:27,720 --> 02:42:30,030
you've mastered something to the point 
of,

3309
02:42:30,190 --> 02:42:31,530
of,
of an end,

3310
02:42:32,070 --> 02:42:35,370
like if you kinda missed out what it's 
all about in the first place,

3311
02:42:35,640 --> 02:42:37,530
it's all.
You're constantly uncomfortable.

3312
02:42:37,531 --> 02:42:39,000
You're supposed to be constantly 
uncomfortable,

3313
02:42:39,270 --> 02:42:41,100
and then in these little victories that 
you get,

3314
02:42:41,101 --> 02:42:43,090
the good thing about when people tap,
you get,

3315
02:42:43,120 --> 02:42:45,000
oh,
I get a little nice feeling right here.

3316
02:42:45,250 --> 02:42:46,350
Then they're like,
let's go again,

3317
02:42:46,410 --> 02:42:47,460
and then I'm like,
oh fuck.

3318
02:42:47,760 --> 02:42:52,760
Back to being uncomfortable and there's 
no getting around and then he taps you 

3319
02:42:52,760 --> 02:42:56,301
and you're like,
oh shit should have quit while I was 

3320
02:42:56,301 --> 02:42:56,301
ahead.
No,

3321
02:42:56,301 --> 02:42:56,301
no,
because you're missing the point.

3322
02:42:56,301 --> 02:42:58,890
The point is that it's a,
it's a long path,

3323
02:42:59,090 --> 02:43:04,090
a long arduous path and I think anything
that's worth doing is probably like 

3324
02:43:04,090 --> 02:43:05,980
that.
There's no doubt about it.

3325
02:43:05,981 --> 02:43:07,050
And,
and that's another,

3326
02:43:07,230 --> 02:43:10,890
another piece again,
another place where Jujitsu is like

3327
02:43:12,430 --> 02:43:17,430
is eat.
You think at some point you think you 

3328
02:43:17,430 --> 02:43:18,550
know,
like you think you're good,

3329
02:43:18,560 --> 02:43:23,560
you think you're doing pretty good and 
then you just get smacked or you get 

3330
02:43:23,560 --> 02:43:26,800
smacked with something.
And like now like when you were 25,

3331
02:43:26,860 --> 02:43:27,880
you were like,
I'm pretty,

3332
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:29,290
I'm pretty good to go,
you know,

3333
02:43:29,291 --> 02:43:31,060
I'm pretty,
I pretty much know what's up.

3334
02:43:31,490 --> 02:43:33,340
And then when you're 30 you're like,
I didn't know anything.

3335
02:43:33,740 --> 02:43:37,570
I was idiot.
And it's true like even.

3336
02:43:37,660 --> 02:43:42,660
And so I think one of the,
one of the things that provide some 

3337
02:43:42,660 --> 02:43:46,951
small portion of like maturity as a 
human being and as a man is when you get

3338
02:43:47,231 --> 02:43:52,231
to the point where you actually realize 
that you don't know everything and 

3339
02:43:52,231 --> 02:43:52,780
you're like looking at yourself like I'm
44,

3340
02:43:52,781 --> 02:43:53,710
and I'm like,
yeah,

3341
02:43:53,770 --> 02:43:56,470
I'm going to learn so much in the next 
three years,

3342
02:43:56,471 --> 02:44:01,471
five years,
I'm going to look at myself at 44 and 

3343
02:44:01,471 --> 02:44:03,631
go,
you have to see how stupid you were 

3344
02:44:03,631 --> 02:44:03,631
then.
And when you come to that realization,

3345
02:44:03,631 --> 02:44:08,160
I think that's a pretty positive thing 
because it takes a while to figure out 

3346
02:44:08,160 --> 02:44:08,950
that hey,
you don't have everything figured out.

3347
02:44:08,980 --> 02:44:13,980
You're,
you're pretty stupid right now even 

3348
02:44:13,980 --> 02:44:13,980
though you don't think.
So.

3349
02:44:13,980 --> 02:44:15,450
Another thing that things like Jujitsu 
teach you,

3350
02:44:15,451 --> 02:44:20,451
and I say Jujitsu,
but it's really an all martial arts 

3351
02:44:20,451 --> 02:44:24,470
thing.
The problem with the other martial arts 

3352
02:44:24,470 --> 02:44:25,230
other than Jujitsu is at a certain point
in time,

3353
02:44:25,231 --> 02:44:27,450
you can't really practice them 100 
percent.

3354
02:44:27,460 --> 02:44:28,680
Yeah,
like striking.

3355
02:44:28,880 --> 02:44:33,880
You really can't practice striking 100 
percent for very long or your brain 

3356
02:44:33,880 --> 02:44:36,870
starts to give out just the fact and 
Jujitsu,

3357
02:44:36,871 --> 02:44:38,940
you can Jujitsu,
you can do it deep,

3358
02:44:38,941 --> 02:44:41,360
deep into your fifties.
I mean there's like a.

3359
02:44:41,390 --> 02:44:43,290
we're Anthony Bourdain,
he's pushing 60,

3360
02:44:43,340 --> 02:44:46,470
still doing it and you know it's not 
that he's going to be a world beater,

3361
02:44:46,471 --> 02:44:50,070
but he can get the most out of it the 
most that he can get out of it.

3362
02:44:50,190 --> 02:44:55,190
It's that stays the same like what you 
get out of it stays the same regardless 

3363
02:44:55,190 --> 02:44:59,730
of your were regardless of the success,
like what you're getting out of it.

3364
02:44:59,820 --> 02:45:03,000
Even if you're getting tapped,
what you're getting out of is doing your

3365
02:45:03,001 --> 02:45:08,001
best and overcoming and improving upon 
what your best is every day and doing so

3366
02:45:09,330 --> 02:45:12,810
in a situation where there is extreme 
consequences,

3367
02:45:12,811 --> 02:45:17,811
you're going to get strangled.
You know you're going to get your arm 

3368
02:45:17,811 --> 02:45:17,811
broken.
If you don't tap,

3369
02:45:17,811 --> 02:45:18,570
you're going to get your leg fucked up.
If you don't tap,

3370
02:45:18,780 --> 02:45:22,260
there's.
It's not as extreme as combat obviously,

3371
02:45:22,261 --> 02:45:27,261
but it is extreme.
You can get in a sport that you're 

3372
02:45:27,271 --> 02:45:32,271
participating in an activity that you're
participating in voluntarily in America 

3373
02:45:32,701 --> 02:45:34,260
at 5:30
on a Tuesday,

3374
02:45:34,430 --> 02:45:36,480
where are you going to get 30 people 
that are going to show up,

3375
02:45:36,630 --> 02:45:40,940
slap hands together and then hug it out 
after it's over and go,

3376
02:45:40,980 --> 02:45:41,890
you're gonna be here tomorrow.
Yeah,

3377
02:45:41,980 --> 02:45:43,700
RLC man.
And then you know,

3378
02:45:43,740 --> 02:45:45,510
back again tomorrow.
Same thing.

3379
02:45:45,560 --> 02:45:45,860
That's

3380
02:45:45,860 --> 02:45:50,860
another kind of primal piece that makes 
Jujitsu so intense is if you and me role

3381
02:45:58,340 --> 02:46:03,340
like and I get you or you get me and I 
tap in my heart.

3382
02:46:05,240 --> 02:46:08,540
I know that if you and I were fighting 
for survival,

3383
02:46:08,930 --> 02:46:12,890
I just lost and you woulda killed me and
I see this with little kids.

3384
02:46:12,891 --> 02:46:15,320
When kids compete,
you tell them,

3385
02:46:15,390 --> 02:46:16,220
listen,
just go out there.

3386
02:46:16,221 --> 02:46:17,420
Have Fun.
It's going to be fun.

3387
02:46:17,630 --> 02:46:19,430
You know?
Just go out there and do your best.

3388
02:46:19,431 --> 02:46:21,560
I don't care if you win or lose,
just go out and have a good time.

3389
02:46:21,650 --> 02:46:22,670
You tell them that.
You tell them that,

3390
02:46:22,730 --> 02:46:27,210
tell them that if they get tapped date,
they start crying.

3391
02:46:27,260 --> 02:46:29,180
It's so emotional.
And why is that?

3392
02:46:29,181 --> 02:46:33,710
Because a part of them inside their head
that they don't even know exists,

3393
02:46:33,980 --> 02:46:38,540
knows that that person had they been in 
a mortal struggle.

3394
02:46:38,690 --> 02:46:41,420
They got beat.
They got their ass kicked.

3395
02:46:41,450 --> 02:46:42,700
Yeah.
It's not like someone.

3396
02:46:42,710 --> 02:46:45,860
This is what I always say like somebody 
dunks a basketball on you.

3397
02:46:45,910 --> 02:46:50,910
It sucks,
but it doesn't mean anything unless you 

3398
02:46:50,910 --> 02:46:51,800
decide it means something.
What does basketball escalate into?

3399
02:46:51,860 --> 02:46:54,370
We'll do all sports.
All sports escalate into finance.

3400
02:46:54,550 --> 02:46:56,330
So if you,
let's get rid of the bat.

3401
02:46:56,810 --> 02:46:57,950
Whatever else.
Let's just fight.

3402
02:46:57,951 --> 02:46:58,880
Let's just,
that's why it's,

3403
02:46:59,120 --> 02:46:59,820
you know,
that's why the,

3404
02:46:59,840 --> 02:47:02,930
I think that UFC has been so highly 
successful because it is,

3405
02:47:02,931 --> 02:47:05,240
it's what it's,
it's the ultimate,

3406
02:47:05,260 --> 02:47:06,680
you know,
in combat sport again,

3407
02:47:06,780 --> 02:47:08,540
you know,
barring combat itself.

3408
02:47:08,890 --> 02:47:13,890
Well it's also why the dorks and pencil 
next hate it so much because they think 

3409
02:47:13,890 --> 02:47:13,890
it's a regression.

3410
02:47:13,890 --> 02:47:16,370
Back to the primal days of caveman 
combat.

3411
02:47:16,371 --> 02:47:20,780
Like what are we supporting some fat 
fuck wrote an article for the New Yorker

3412
02:47:20,781 --> 02:47:24,090
or New York Post or something like that,
about the Ronda Rousey loss,

3413
02:47:24,091 --> 02:47:26,940
about how barbaric and disgusting it was
and what,

3414
02:47:26,950 --> 02:47:27,350
uh,
what,

3415
02:47:27,351 --> 02:47:29,830
what bullshit that we were fed and that,
you know,

3416
02:47:29,940 --> 02:47:34,940
were made out that she was this 
unconquerable in to watch her beaten 

3417
02:47:34,940 --> 02:47:37,760
unconscious was disgusting.
And you don't get it man.

3418
02:47:37,790 --> 02:47:40,790
Like you don't get it like what you're 
doing with your fat face,

3419
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:46,000
like shoving cheeseburgers down your mug
is way worse than anything that she did 

3420
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:47,750
inside that octagon.
It's interesting because that

3421
02:47:48,340 --> 02:47:53,340
kind of attitude can,
can cross borders into other things.

3422
02:47:53,620 --> 02:47:54,640
And you know,
I,

3423
02:47:54,690 --> 02:47:56,670
I,
I end up talking to people you know,

3424
02:47:56,740 --> 02:47:57,820
through,
through our company,

3425
02:47:58,120 --> 02:48:03,120
people that are smart.
You mean every like I'll be in a room 

3426
02:48:03,120 --> 02:48:03,890
with everyone's,
went to an Ivy League college,

3427
02:48:03,891 --> 02:48:07,450
had been super successful in their worth
millions and millions if not hundreds of

3428
02:48:07,450 --> 02:48:12,450
millions of dollars.
And I was given one of these talks the 

3429
02:48:12,450 --> 02:48:12,450
other day and we do,
you know,

3430
02:48:12,450 --> 02:48:14,800
of course they ended up asking me about 
Isis and all that.

3431
02:48:15,610 --> 02:48:20,080
And as I'm sitting there looking and I'm
thinking to myself like,

3432
02:48:20,110 --> 02:48:25,110
these people are all looking at me and 
thinking I'm just a savage,

3433
02:48:26,350 --> 02:48:27,370
right?
I'm just like,

3434
02:48:27,371 --> 02:48:28,630
Hey,
I'm a knuckle dragger.

3435
02:48:28,631 --> 02:48:31,870
We just need to go kill everyone.
And so I tried to explain to them,

3436
02:48:31,871 --> 02:48:32,470
I'm like,
listen,

3437
02:48:34,300 --> 02:48:39,300
I almost,
I almost feel ashamed to say this to 

3438
02:48:39,971 --> 02:48:44,971
everyone here because everyone here is 
an intellectual and is very,

3439
02:48:45,971 --> 02:48:49,840
very smart.
But there are some problems in the world

3440
02:48:50,350 --> 02:48:53,020
that there is not an academic solution 
to.

3441
02:48:53,800 --> 02:48:58,800
And sometimes violence is the solution.
And again,

3442
02:48:59,380 --> 02:49:01,210
there can be a million arguments against
that.

3443
02:49:02,740 --> 02:49:06,550
But the reality of it is in the world,
it's like you were talking about earlier

3444
02:49:06,580 --> 02:49:07,680
in the world,

3445
02:49:08,280 --> 02:49:13,280
there are evil people that do evil 
things and the only way to stop them is 

3446
02:49:14,821 --> 02:49:19,821
to confront them and destroy them.
And unfortunately we,

3447
02:49:20,220 --> 02:49:25,220
we are so disconnected from that,
that it makes people look at UFC and go,

3448
02:49:25,471 --> 02:49:27,180
oh my God,
how could that happen?

3449
02:49:27,420 --> 02:49:28,930
And it makes people look at,
you know,

3450
02:49:28,950 --> 02:49:30,780
a military attack and say,
oh my God,

3451
02:49:30,781 --> 02:49:34,860
how could that happen?
It can happen because we're human beings

3452
02:49:35,010 --> 02:49:40,010
and we're imperfect and there are.
There are evil people in the world.

3453
02:49:40,950 --> 02:49:43,860
Well,
the people that think there's no ever.

3454
02:49:43,861 --> 02:49:46,980
There's no excuse for a violence 
solution.

3455
02:49:47,550 --> 02:49:50,220
Take those people,
bring them to Ramadi right now,

3456
02:49:50,221 --> 02:49:50,900
right?
Yeah.

3457
02:49:52,050 --> 02:49:54,310
I mean,
how do you deal with evil

3458
02:49:54,340 --> 02:49:56,590
when it exists?
How do you deal with it?

3459
02:49:56,610 --> 02:49:57,670
Do you,
do you hug them?

3460
02:49:58,060 --> 02:50:00,400
Do you knock on their door with flowers?
What do you do?

3461
02:50:00,490 --> 02:50:01,810
I mean,
what is the solution?

3462
02:50:02,660 --> 02:50:04,180
They don't have an answer.
They have an aunt.

3463
02:50:04,181 --> 02:50:09,181
The only reason why they even have that 
attitude is because they live here in 

3464
02:50:09,181 --> 02:50:12,421
this sheltered environment,
in our beautiful bubble we call the 

3465
02:50:12,421 --> 02:50:12,421
United States of America

3466
02:50:12,530 --> 02:50:17,530
that many brave men and women have 
provided and will continue to provide 

3467
02:50:17,530 --> 02:50:19,100
regardless of what is said about them.
And uh,

3468
02:50:20,060 --> 02:50:22,190
God bless those folks out there on the 
wire.

3469
02:50:22,700 --> 02:50:25,220
Yes sir.
And with that extreme ownership,

3470
02:50:25,250 --> 02:50:26,210
that was three hours,
man,

3471
02:50:26,240 --> 02:50:29,720
we just banged out three hours a day on 
crazy right here,

3472
02:50:29,750 --> 02:50:31,820
Jocko willink and Leif,
Leif,

3473
02:50:31,880 --> 02:50:35,270
Leif Lafe,
Lafe Babin extreme ownership,

3474
02:50:35,271 --> 02:50:40,070
how us navy seals lead and win.
And Jocko is on twitter,

3475
02:50:40,071 --> 02:50:43,310
Jocko willink on twitter.
Is that what is Jocko willink and uh,

3476
02:50:43,370 --> 02:50:45,680
what is it on?
Do you have anything else?

3477
02:50:45,790 --> 02:50:47,450
Website?
Well,

3478
02:50:47,960 --> 02:50:48,350
yeah,
we have,

3479
02:50:48,351 --> 02:50:50,150
we have a facebook for extreme 
ownership.

3480
02:50:50,151 --> 02:50:51,650
We have an extreme ownership.
Twitter.

3481
02:50:52,640 --> 02:50:57,640
Yeah.
We're out there in the social media 

3482
02:50:57,640 --> 02:50:58,430
world broadcasting ourselves and soon a 
podcast.

3483
02:50:58,431 --> 02:50:59,540
Right.
And I will,

3484
02:50:59,541 --> 02:51:01,380
I will do a podcast that.
See,

3485
02:51:01,720 --> 02:51:03,590
I knew I will do it.
Going to happen.

3486
02:51:03,920 --> 02:51:06,350
Echo Charles,
be ready to record a podcast.

3487
02:51:06,351 --> 02:51:07,730
Brother.
Thank you very much.

3488
02:51:07,731 --> 02:51:08,570
Sorry,
this was awesome.

3489
02:51:08,571 --> 02:51:11,330
I really,
really appreciate it and I will put up a

3490
02:51:11,331 --> 02:51:14,600
link on Amazon after the podcast,

3491
02:51:14,950 --> 02:51:15,790
Thank you very much,
John.

3492
02:51:15,791 --> 02:51:16,450
I appreciate it,
brother.

3493
02:51:16,460 --> 02:51:17,150
Thanks for having me on.
