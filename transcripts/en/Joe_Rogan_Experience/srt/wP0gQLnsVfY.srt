1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,180
I do bad shows.

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:04,290
If I'm hung over,

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,580
I don't like my shows.

5
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,780
They don't feel good.

6
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,550
They don't have the flow to them,

7
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:09,331
you know?

8
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:10,180
And I,

9
00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:10,801
I just,

10
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:11,940
I hate that feeling.

11
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:14,540
I hate the feeling of
being on stage and it's,

12
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,000
it would be my fault if I was hung
over if I was hung over on seats.

13
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:18,240
It's like,

14
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,380
it's my fault that I'm working at like
three quarter speed right now or it's not

15
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:23,191
clicking right now.

16
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:24,190
Like that's so,

17
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:24,540
yeah.

18
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:24,661
Well,

19
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:26,070
I wish I could just have one,

20
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,600
but it's not satisfying because you have
one and then you want a hundred and,

21
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:30,210
and then,

22
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,520
and then you drink a hundred
and then you feel like shit.

23
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,650
And like if I just drink one,

24
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:36,000
like I've have one at lunch,

25
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,610
then it's like I want to go take a nap.

26
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,950
If I either got to keep going,

27
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,970
if I keep going,

28
00:00:41,971 --> 00:00:42,840
I can go for like,

29
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:43,763
you know,

30
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,780
a good hardcore for,

31
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,640
or a gentleman six

32
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,633
and then I'm done.

33
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:51,871
But like,

34
00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:52,704
uh,

35
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:53,221
I,

36
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:54,054
yeah,

37
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,440
I feel pulled to it.

38
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,330
No.

39
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,740
Is it like Gollum in the ring?

40
00:00:58,870 --> 00:00:59,051
No,

41
00:00:59,051 --> 00:00:59,351
I just,

42
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,184
I don't know what that means.

43
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,023
I just,

44
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,200
I just like,

45
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,461
no,

46
00:01:03,461 --> 00:01:03,671
no,

47
00:01:03,671 --> 00:01:04,490
no,

48
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:05,323
no.

49
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,550
I don't even know what that is.

50
00:01:09,551 --> 00:01:11,440
I don't want to see the Lord of the rings.

51
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:12,880
You didn't see the Lord of the rings.

52
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,780
I went to one of those and it was so
fucking long and every time they wouldn't,

53
00:01:16,781 --> 00:01:18,100
they would fade to black.

54
00:01:18,101 --> 00:01:18,611
I'd be like,

55
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:19,570
just roll the credits,

56
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,153
roll the credits,

57
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,730
and then they would open up on some
big field and it's just like Jesus,

58
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,210
get the fucking thing back to the
guy so we can get out of here.

59
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,800
I hate,

60
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:30,041
I,

61
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:30,341
you know what?

62
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:33,970
I fucking hate all of
them and I fucking paid,

63
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:37,300
people don't have a sense of humor about
the bullshit that they watched when

64
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,793
they were kids.

65
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,230
Like adults who talk about star wars,

66
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:45,430
like that isn't a fucking
movie now when you watch it,

67
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,890
I mean like how busy,

68
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:47,763
terrible.

69
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,050
I was making fun of the other night.

70
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,240
The other night I came home,

71
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:52,900
I got,

72
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,920
I got free,

73
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:54,160
uh,

74
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,030
free Cinemax,

75
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,770
which is the greatest
fucking channel ever.

76
00:01:56,771 --> 00:01:58,630
They either 24 hours a day.

77
00:01:58,631 --> 00:02:02,230
They're either showing the greatest movie
ever or the worst fucking movie ever.

78
00:02:02,231 --> 00:02:05,680
And it's all compelling as I
watch like nine movies in a row,

79
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:06,670
like this fucking channels.

80
00:02:06,671 --> 00:02:07,504
Unbelievable.

81
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,030
So I ended up flipping up,

82
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,953
uh,

83
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,191
cause late at night.

84
00:02:12,191 --> 00:02:13,090
They just had some sort of,

85
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:13,340
you know,

86
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,111
softcore porn,

87
00:02:14,111 --> 00:02:15,760
which is ridiculous now
when you have the Internet.

88
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:16,750
So just was redundant.

89
00:02:16,751 --> 00:02:16,961
Sorry,

90
00:02:16,961 --> 00:02:17,794
I got off of that.

91
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,270
So I went on to VH one.

92
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,080
Uh,

93
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,460
and,

94
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,670
and they were playing this show metal
mania and I was watching all these bands

95
00:02:24,671 --> 00:02:27,670
in these videos that I just thought
were fucking sick and they were injured.

96
00:02:27,671 --> 00:02:28,151
The devil,

97
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:28,840
Dude,

98
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,870
I was just by the NFL.

99
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,131
It's like,

100
00:02:30,131 --> 00:02:31,600
how is this better than disco?

101
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,940
Like why did disco gets so much shit?

102
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:36,730
Like I'm not talking about like the
iron maidens and metallic Metallica's,

103
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,290
but you know what I'm talking about?

104
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,640
That middle of the fucking ground,

105
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,790
those people with the spiked fucking
gloves and all this stupid shit and rom

106
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,090
meat and it was just,

107
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,530
it was horse shit.

108
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,690
It was fucking,

109
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,451
I watched it.

110
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:50,680
It was the dumbest shit ever.

111
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:51,730
It was embarrassing that I,

112
00:02:51,731 --> 00:02:52,390
I mean,

113
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,860
I moved,

114
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,080
granted I had all of that
music still on my iPod.

115
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,471
I'm not,

116
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:56,891
I'm not,

117
00:02:56,891 --> 00:02:57,724
I'm not above it.

118
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,640
But if someone were,

119
00:02:58,641 --> 00:03:01,930
were from this generation would have come
back and tell me that music was awful

120
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:02,764
and it was stupid.

121
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,670
I would laugh.

122
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,031
There's like,

123
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:05,620
there's no way I could defend it.

124
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,000
Isn't it weird how you look at,

125
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,200
like if you look at music
or you look at movies,

126
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,800
that's like one of the clearest examples
of like some sort of a evolution or

127
00:03:16,471 --> 00:03:19,780
progress is going on with
humans because like the,

128
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,240
the movies of the past,

129
00:03:21,241 --> 00:03:25,200
like so many of them are
there are so clunky and the,

130
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:25,391
the,

131
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:25,651
the,

132
00:03:25,651 --> 00:03:25,891
the,

133
00:03:25,891 --> 00:03:29,160
the style of communicating
is so artificial.

134
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,143
It looks,

135
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:30,971
it's,

136
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:32,400
it's such a shit,

137
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:33,300
you know,

138
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,740
representation of life

139
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,930
in comparison to a real good mood
until the 60 once they figured out,

140
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,243
you know,

141
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:40,730
like,

142
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,870
just acting on film,

143
00:03:41,871 --> 00:03:43,550
like those people just
learning how to do it.

144
00:03:43,551 --> 00:03:44,361
So everything was,

145
00:03:44,361 --> 00:03:44,760
was,

146
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,100
uh,

147
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:50,100
gonna be not like that type of acting
had to go away with the Brando's and the

148
00:03:51,471 --> 00:03:52,251
James Deans.

149
00:03:52,251 --> 00:03:52,911
And those guys.

150
00:03:52,911 --> 00:03:54,770
And then you had to have like the uh,

151
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:55,890
there's a couple of wood,

152
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,950
like this movie's back
there like Jack Lemmon,

153
00:03:57,951 --> 00:03:58,784
the apartment.

154
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,670
Well the hustler is way ahead
of his time that the hustler,

155
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,820
Stanley Cooper,

156
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,520
Cooper,

157
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,360
that type of shit.

158
00:04:05,361 --> 00:04:07,220
There was some guilt with
it still holds up though.

159
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,560
But those were the bad movies
from the 60s and the 70s you know,

160
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,360
watch like try to wash like Jaws Three d

161
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,700
oh yeah,

162
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,533
no,

163
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,360
this,

164
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,300
is this a bad bill always had,

165
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:19,560
they still have movies like sure.

166
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,710
I mean I think the shore to
this day transformer shit,

167
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,700
even though I didn't see it,

168
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,860
but if you see it and I never,

169
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,030
I never vibe with Scifi people,

170
00:04:27,031 --> 00:04:28,050
like Scifi listeners,

171
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:29,970
I always get trashed by
them because I just don't,

172
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,150
I just don't get,

173
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,570
unless you don't get Psi Phi at all.

174
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:32,970
No.

175
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,830
If it's like aliens,

176
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,840
like it has to be high quality.

177
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:39,830
Like aliens is like the
Goodfellas of that side.

178
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,680
I like on like top shelf Skyfii I'm
going to be in the blade runner,

179
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,540
the aliens and that type of Shit.

180
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:46,620
But if I'm just going to go watch,

181
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,020
you know,

182
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,391
oh we're,

183
00:04:47,391 --> 00:04:48,260

184
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,631
I even,

185
00:04:48,631 --> 00:04:49,650
what the fuck that's from?

186
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,371
What is Hoff?

187
00:04:50,371 --> 00:04:50,641
Is that,

188
00:04:50,641 --> 00:04:51,660
that's a star wars thing.

189
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,140
I don't know.

190
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,090
I don't know what that is.

191
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,390
Like one of those fucking things,

192
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,710
the action figures and shit and
it's just you like transformers.

193
00:04:59,250 --> 00:04:59,941
I didn't like,

194
00:04:59,941 --> 00:05:03,330
I didn't like Chewbacca Chewbacca.

195
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:03,871
It's like,

196
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,141

197
00:05:04,141 --> 00:05:06,060

awesome guy to have around.

198
00:05:06,061 --> 00:05:06,894
He's huge.

199
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,730
And imagine you can party with bigfoot.

200
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,880
I would totally party should
be ripping somebody arms off.

201
00:05:11,881 --> 00:05:12,750
He's shooting a gun.

202
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:13,501
Like he's a fucking,

203
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:13,830
he's like,

204
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,340
he's,

205
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,470
he's a bad ass limit is
how to shoot guns too.

206
00:05:16,471 --> 00:05:17,640
He'll rip your fucking arms off,

207
00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:19,260
but he can also shoot you from a distance.

208
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:19,920
Bitch.

209
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,730
He's limited.

210
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,031
Oh,

211
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:21,864
I like to box.

212
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,460
I would totally hang out with,

213
00:05:23,461 --> 00:05:24,290
you know what did that and again,

214
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:24,480
you know,

215
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,171
I didn't like about him.

216
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:26,190
He was a follower.

217
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,330
Well started.

218
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,240
He started hanging out with all the humans
and next thing he knows he's sitting

219
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:30,631
up right.

220
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:31,464
And chairs,

221
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,071
right?

222
00:05:32,071 --> 00:05:33,600
Sip and little juicy juices.

223
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,210
Yeah.

224
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,630
I wonder if he can understand it.

225
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,730
Could they understand him?

226
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,600
They could speak to that.

227
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,120
I think it was a language,

228
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,710
but we just didn't understand it.

229
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:45,510
So all that same fucking thing.

230
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,440
Not that many wookies you know,

231
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,830
it's like Chewbacca and
like there's no other

232
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,050
what he was like the Dodo bird.

233
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:53,600
No,

234
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,190
weird.

235
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:57,810
We're going to be destroyed on Twitter
cause we are star wars knowledge and you

236
00:05:57,811 --> 00:05:58,020
know,

237
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,400
we're going to get this shit forever.

238
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,160
There's a fucking million wookey's.

239
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,220
There is a nation of Lucky's.

240
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,500
There is a federation of Little Keys,

241
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:07,731
you know,

242
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:12,731
not what you're talking about is nothing
better than just having a fucking 10%

243
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:18,020
knowledge of the sizing of it because
it's just driving some kid nuts.

244
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:18,440
Okay.
