1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,510
Hello Freak bitches.
Yeah.

2
00:00:03,511 --> 00:00:07,110
So if we replaced a sacred for respect,
I think we'd be.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,190
But it's just noises.
It's one of the things I like about

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,120
labels.
Like I liked intent and intent.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,580
Like my,
my idea of sacred is not like God,

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,460
like it's not like some,
it's not a deity,

7
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:24,660
this unnamed unknown word that's been
passed down from person to person.

8
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:27,090
It's based on personal experience based
on a real thing.

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,290
So when I say sacred,
like my love,

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,400
my love for my children is sacred,
you know,

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,700
like I say it in that window.
I don't say it like in terms of like

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,130
hearts and the clouds and all that kind
of jazz.

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,180
And when we were talking about like
don't be an asshole to people you care

14
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:45,360
about,
like doesn't mean it certainly doesn't

15
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:48,690
mean I'm some sort of a perfect person.
Certain doesn't mean that I have been an

16
00:00:48,691 --> 00:00:49,410
asshole.

17
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,570
And then sometimes when you're
responding to someone else being

18
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:53,550
retarded or something about being
ridiculous,

19
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:57,570
you can be an asshole because you don't
have the patience for it anymore because

20
00:00:57,571 --> 00:00:59,230
you don't have the,
uh,

21
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,850
at the moment you don't have the
temperament to charity.

22
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:03,580
Yeah.
What?

23
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,920
Yeah,
it could be maturity.

24
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:08,550
It could be you're overwhelmed.
There's a lot of variables.

25
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,830
So like if someone hears this and says,
you know,

26
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:12,601
Oh,
well man,

27
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:16,020
I've been an asshole lately.
Maybe I'm a bad person.

28
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:16,470
Like,
no,

29
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,700
it's just recognizing those moments
where you probably could have handled

30
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:23,160
something better.
And then continuing to approve.

31
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:25,200
And then also this idea,
there's,

32
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,100
this is a really important one because
people have this idea that somehow I'm

33
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:31,350
30 years old,
I shouldn't be doing this anymore.

34
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:33,660
I'm 50 years old.
I should have learned by now.

35
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,700
That's all bullshit.
Throw that away,

36
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,170
tossed that shit aside.

37
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,430
You like these ideas of numbers that
people have in their head that by a

38
00:01:41,431 --> 00:01:45,150
certain age you should stop.
You are alive.

39
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,600
And if you are alive,
and if you were thinking all those

40
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:52,240
numbers that you keep attaching,
will you know when Einstein was 30 here,

41
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,910
shut the fuck up,
stop doing that.

42
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,690
That that is a waste of your time and
stop saying to yourself,

43
00:01:57,691 --> 00:02:02,691
I should be better by now.
I'm such a total non helping thought

44
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,950
what you need to think of his life.
You're living,

45
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,920
you're alive right now.
And if you've made a mistake and you're

46
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:13,710
still continuing to learn and grow,
that's all just data.

47
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,640
But the thing that freaks me out the
most about rockhold is the flexibility

48
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:21,030
and dexterity of his legs.
That takes so long to develop that kind

49
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:22,230
of whip.
You know,

50
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:23,640
like his kicks aren't just hard.

51
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,610
Like Weidman has strong kicks,
their strong,

52
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:30,180
like he throws him,
but there's a stiffness to him that

53
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:33,630
rockwell doesn't have.
Rock holds got like a taekwondo thing

54
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:34,720
going big.
Yeah.

55
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:38,460
It isn't a sake.
He was 16 and in,

56
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:40,440
in San Jose when we were hanging out,
I said,

57
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:42,150
how much do you weigh?
Sixty eight.

58
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,550
Of course I did.
I took a mounted in your face.

59
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:47,070
I took him in and I took him in,
but don't kid yourself.

60
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:52,071
Had My hand on his back couple times and
either Brian came back from hanging out.

61
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,830
Lewis had got his haircut just like him.
I went,

62
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,160
the fuck you doing.
He goes around Luke,

63
00:02:58,161 --> 00:02:59,550
so I wanted to get my hair like I'm
like,

64
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,400
you're 48

65
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,510
copying.
I look him in the eye and I went,

66
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,100
got exactly like luke when we go to a
bar and I looked at my window and we

67
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:08,440
caught eyes and I looked at my.
When I told you,

68
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,820
and he goes,
he smiled and he went six,

69
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,820
three and I go,
of course you are,

70
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,510
and I looked at his hair and I go deeper
with your voice where we're at a moment

71
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,430
guys.
We had a moment here.

72
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,520
Then I went right to super gods for $12
on my gut and I looked at a picture of

73
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:32,701
Luke rockhold that you fucking try and
fingers my friend Tarek who trains luke

74
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,121
goes,
hey,

75
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:36,220
counts here.
I think you'd suck luke steak.

76
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:39,520
We ask them did you can take.
You can take.

77
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:42,810
I think out of that sentence,
all right,

78
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,740
I'll do it just as a coop.
Don't tell anybody.

79
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,330
I think by and large people can have the
perspective that you have.

80
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,260
They can say,
well,

81
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,200
looks to me like everybody did it.
So okay.

82
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,090
Uh,
then they can look to the line and they,

83
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,760
that's where they really start to not
like it.

84
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,070
They said this guy lied to us
repeatedly,

85
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,800
but of course you get my,
there's no defense to that.

86
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:06,230
But if I could,
if I could share any personal insight.

87
00:04:06,231 --> 00:04:07,001
I mean,
once you lie,

88
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:09,730
once you just keep lying,
you keep saying this is,

89
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:11,210
if I'm going to sit here,
you know,

90
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,870
this is 15 years ago and Joe,
you're a nice guy and you.

91
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,690
I mean if I was on this podcast,
I would allied to your fucking face a

92
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,070
million times.
Just so you know,

93
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,980
I have just show you now,
just so you know,

94
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,790
that's not a surprise to you or anybody
else,

95
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,880
but once you're in there,
it's not as if I'm going to go,

96
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:32,980
you know,
this Guy Joe seems like a really nice

97
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:33,130
guy.

98
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,870
I think I'm going to be real,
I'm going to be honest with him,

99
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,780
too much money.
There's no way you can't once that.

100
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,710
Yeah.
So I was,

101
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,830
I was stuck,
for lack of a better word in that,

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,470
uh,
in that lie or that deception,

103
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,340
but then the way that I took my
competitive nature,

104
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,720
which served me well in training and in
racing and took it into the real world,

105
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,840
took it into a press conference,
took it into a personal relationship,

106
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:59,710
took it into former teammates.
My relationship with that.

107
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,510
That's the part where people go,
okay,

108
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,450
fuck this guy forever.
I'm done.

109
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,110
And so,
um,

110
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,190
that,
you know,

111
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,990
you've got sort of three phases.
None of them are good,

112
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,570
but as it got further away,
um,

113
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,470
that,
um,

114
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,970
you know,
lack of respect for others is the thing

115
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:21,400
that totally fucked me.
And you know,

116
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:25,270
too that I would,
I would say to anybody that I understand

117
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,110
and,
and um,

118
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,000
I may be in their time out forever.

119
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,280
Um,
I have,

120
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,350
uh,
the only thing I will add that,

121
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:34,570
that,
that may sound like I'm trying to defend

122
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:38,110
myself as I've,
I've tried to make amends with all those

123
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:39,040
people,
right?

124
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,290
The ones that we all know,
the ones people talk about,

125
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,080
I've traveled the world,
I've sat with them,

126
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,560
I've,
I've looked them in the eyes and said

127
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:47,590
what I did was totally unacceptable that
I'm sorry.

128
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,070
Um,
and almost everybody has accepted the

129
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:54,050
apology and we've moved on.
Um,

130
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,130
but that doesn't get to this,
this,

131
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,330
this crowd of people that you can't sit
with face to face and you can't say

132
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:03,550
you're sorry.
I mean,

133
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,330
I can talk to you,
we can talk about it.

134
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,420
Some people may view that as an apology
or,

135
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,383
or not,
but,

136
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,480
but the ones that I could go sit with,
I did.

137
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,650
And that's all that I would add to that.

138
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,483
And I,
and I,

139
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,710
and I,
I mean,

140
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,930
I'm proud that most of those people,
and I say most,

141
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,690
not everybody because not everybody's
ready,

142
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,760
but most of those people said,
you know what,

143
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,470
we're good,
we're done.

144
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,750
And so,
uh,

145
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,490
if there was my son and he acted that
way,

146
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:30,230
first of all,
I'd say the fuck you doing,

147
00:06:30,231 --> 00:06:32,200
you can't act that way.
But I had no,

148
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,040
nobody was standing over me going,
dude,

149
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,620
what are you,
what do you,

150
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,090
you're acting like an asshole.
Nope,

151
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,050
nobody did that.
So,

152
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,320
but if my son did that,
I would say you get over there and you

153
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:46,040
make it right with that person.
So that's where it is.

154
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,170
And uh,
here we go.

155
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,150
Well there was a,
like,

156
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,380
what I can only describe as like a gun
bodega,

157
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,770
which is fascinating because it's sold
all these different guns.

158
00:06:55,771 --> 00:06:58,350
Like it might sound like a beautiful
antique,

159
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,500
you know,
Pearl Inlaid revolver that like

160
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,670
someone's dad had,
but then also grenades and stuff and

161
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,620
grenades.
Grenades.

162
00:07:04,621 --> 00:07:05,460
Yeah.
Because,

163
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,220
you know,
in case someone tried to kidnap you,

164
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:10,140
you could have it grab a fucking.
You're coming with me bitch.

165
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,700
Basically.
Basically.

166
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:14,610
Yeah.
So we're walking through this town and

167
00:07:14,611 --> 00:07:16,320
um,
that was,

168
00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:19,230
I think the scariest thing that I ever
did in my life.

169
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,800
But it all turned out fine.
And we got to the media office,

170
00:07:22,801 --> 00:07:26,070
which it was a government building that
they,

171
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,680
that these young men have taken over
when they kicked out the central

172
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:32,760
government and I'm the director of it,
had been kidnapped by Isis and the young

173
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:34,020
guys are there,
like watching,

174
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,050
watching soccer because everyone,
everyone loves soccer there.

175
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,000
And it was just,
I don't know,

176
00:07:42,001 --> 00:07:46,410
it's like
this feeling of being in this place

177
00:07:46,411 --> 00:07:51,411
where I'm,
the whole world is both fucking with it

178
00:07:51,691 --> 00:07:53,520
and abandoned it both at once,
you know,

179
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,150
and um,
and anything could happen.

180
00:07:57,151 --> 00:07:58,650
So that was the most dangerous thing
I've ever done.

181
00:07:58,651 --> 00:08:01,380
Like nothing I've ever done was as
dangerous is going to Syria.

182
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,160
But I think the most app personally
disturbing thing was um,

183
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,340
I was in Gaza six months ago I guess.
And I went to [inaudible],

184
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,730
which is this neighborhood that was
completely destroyed by Israel during

185
00:08:14,731 --> 00:08:16,830
protective edge.
Like they bombed it and then they went

186
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:18,750
in with tanks and then they went in with
bulldozers.

187
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,020
Like,
so it's like flattened and it's just

188
00:08:22,021 --> 00:08:23,400
like gone.
Like,

189
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:24,040
you know,
you,

190
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,470
you go there and you're like,
this is,

191
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:29,460
this is a neighborhood that has been
wrecked and a lot of times when you see

192
00:08:29,461 --> 00:08:33,510
houses that have collapsed,
you can see all of the stuff of people's

193
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:34,530
lives and it like,
you're like,

194
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,530
oh,
there's the cooking pots and there's the

195
00:08:37,531 --> 00:08:40,020
bed and there's all the stuff that's
just trapped in.

196
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,620
And then people,
because there's a big housing shortage,

197
00:08:43,621 --> 00:08:48,000
obviously in Gaza were living in these
bombed out buildings,

198
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:49,350
you know,
where their home was.

199
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,220
And um,
you know,

200
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:56,010
with no real like,
or anything.

201
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:58,470
Like I saw this,
I was walking,

202
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,260
it was kind of scrambling through this
building,

203
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,000
take pictures.
And then I just randomly walked into

204
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,870
what I thought was an abandoned room and
there's like an old guy there,

205
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,631
you know,
hanging out.

206
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:09,140
And I was like,
I'm really sorry to invade,

207
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,420
invade your home.
And I was just talking to him.

208
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:14,520
But yeah,
he had had like a baller,

209
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:15,590
gorgeous home,
you know,

210
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,030
before this.
And now he was just living in a little,

211
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,520
like the wreck of one of the rooms.
