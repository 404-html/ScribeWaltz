1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,470
The joe rogan experience
of the bad people.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:03,513
Sure.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,800
Tell me the punk kid story
because I'm frustrated.

4
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,090
What are you frustrated about?

5
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:07,990
Because I love that song.

6
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,970
That song has not died.

7
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,120
We you want to hear a song first?

8
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,320
Yes.

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:14,860
Okay.

10
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,693
Whatever you want to do.

11
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,230
Let's play bad people.

12
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,710
I'm going to take these off and thinking.

13
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:19,763
Is that Okay Jamie?

14
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:20,973
I'll just sing.

15
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,620
We just won't put it on our next record.

16
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,670
Yeah.

17
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,270
Okay.

18
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,103
Good move.

19
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,340
The legend will grow.

20
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,630
There were some a record company
in congruencies that like,

21
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,050
I know you weren't able to do the things
we wanted with it and it's a really

22
00:00:35,051 --> 00:00:36,400
tested it by saying,

23
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:37,803
wait,

24
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,183
good move.

25
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,220
It's a good song.

26
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:40,491
It's a,

27
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:42,130
it's a weird song to song.

28
00:00:42,131 --> 00:00:43,420
It's got a lot of layers to it.

29
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,920
It's a lot going on.

30
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,700
Lot going on.

31
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,533
That song.

32
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,710
They got a weird shit.

33
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,190
I think I would usually go,

34
00:00:51,191 --> 00:00:51,480
can I?

35
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,313
We can we just do it?

36
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,161
Hi.

37
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:08,120
I'm the gatekeeper.

38
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,230
Just send them out front yard,

39
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,540
which in the rain in Paul,

40
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:18,490
so on.

41
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,920
You got to see

42
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,140
judge your best to be the worst.

43
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,580
You must like,

44
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:28,821
hey,

45
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:30,430
that show Kirsten.

46
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,653
Oh,

47
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:57,970
ah,

48
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,130
Jimmy was it broken?

49
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,200
Sangoma out.

50
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,120
Ellen nut bread.

51
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:05,430
Like a pimple

52
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,870
on his nose.

53
00:02:07,871 --> 00:02:09,220
He was bloody all his life.

54
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,700
He cashed the check.

55
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,690
Ready?

56
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,700
No lovers off friends to it.

57
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,230
Dan,

58
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,640
hold on.

59
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:48,150
Stop Chimney.

60
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,700
Add some darkness.

61
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,790
Parsley's out.

62
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,700
We all got some darkness up,

63
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,200
asleep,

64
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,960
some pools down and some push through

65
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,951
baby.

66
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:21,000
It's a toss up.

67
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:24,870
How you do maybe some
on the sides for you.

68
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,200
Maybe you don't even get,

69
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,270
uh,

70
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,040
hi dog.

71
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,090
No,

72
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,093
not

73
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,170
come from no

74
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:07,330
god.

75
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,163
Damn you got

76
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,303
both of you,

77
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,490
both of you for being so awesome.

78
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,201
God Damn,

79
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:18,034
that was good.

80
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,450
You know what was really cool?

81
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,750
People that are listening to this only
you don't know that Suzanne adjusted

82
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:24,460
Ben's glasses in the middle of the song.

83
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,300
That's Ben's glasses started
a slab and Suzanne like Lego,

84
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,750
like a mama bear came over.

85
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,990
Set you straight.

86
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,230
It happens some but it in the middle
of like singing without missing a beat.

87
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,093
It was beautiful.

88
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:39,510
Well.
