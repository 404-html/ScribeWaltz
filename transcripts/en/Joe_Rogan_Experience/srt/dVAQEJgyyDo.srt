Hello Freak bitches.
How much material do you think?

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,760
I would say if you're going to become a
big name standup comedian,

3
00:00:08,761 --> 00:00:10,380
you're going to have to put out a bunch
of specials.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,560
Right?
So if you put out how many specials can

5
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:16,950
you do on your life before you have to
start talking about other shit?

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,160
Probably,
you know,

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,160
or five,
four or five specials.

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,480
Just cause a lot of stuff that I
remember it like it was so edit time,

9
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:27,300
like I can laugh at it now,
but back then it was paying.

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,240
So I didn't get all drugs like my sister
did.

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,370
I didn't do,
my brother didn't got on drugs to deal

12
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:34,820
with bullshit that we was going through.
I just,

13
00:00:34,821 --> 00:00:35,641
they,
you know,

14
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:39,450
sober thought he mava goes crazy.
So to get rid of the pain,

15
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:42,060
I just kept putting it in the back of my
head.

16
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,850
I didn't want to remember it.
So when I became a comic,

17
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,140
all of this shit start rushing through
my brain and I have to ask my sister,

18
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,310
bitch,
is this real?

19
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:53,790
I just asked my sister the other day,
my granddaddy ran a bootleg house.

20
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,330
So in this bootleg house,
I had a retarded uncle named uncle cecil

21
00:00:57,331 --> 00:01:00,750
that was crippled,
but my granddad would buy him pussy on

22
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:03,660
Friday.
But me and my sister would have to go in

23
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:07,710
there with a prostitute and hold his
legs back until he gets his dicky before

24
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:10,700
we could go outside and play.
So I called her up and I said,

25
00:01:10,701 --> 00:01:14,520
is this shit real?
You get a hold his legs back cause he's

26
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:17,160
a cripple.
You know how when they need so he

27
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:19,740
couldn't,
we couldn't get it in until we move this

28
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:21,990
fucking legs back.
Wow.

29
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,890
I remember one time I was like,
hurry up probably eight.

30
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,010
I was like,
oh go see.

31
00:01:27,011 --> 00:01:30,210
So stop fucking smile because they were
retarded.

32
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:35,211
He's
awful.

33
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,840
He's so fucking off.
And I asked my brother,

34
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:39,674
I was like,
do y'all

35
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,410
limited shit?
I'm going crazy and all.

36
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,290
I'm like,
come on brother.

37
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,690
Last weekend I said,
my Mama used to have this theory.

38
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:50,500
She's saying when when it rains and the
signage shine,

39
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,470
the devil was beating his wife.
You ever heard of that?

40
00:01:53,471 --> 00:01:54,490
Yes.
And as you say,

41
00:01:54,491 --> 00:01:57,310
if it will rain and the lightning and
the song was shot,

42
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,750
he caught the beast.
Cheeky.

43
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,193
He's all season.

44
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,410
You should be the beach.
Cause she don't believe in God

45
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,850
damn.
Talking about you crazy.

46
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,620
Somebody I used to think they stole me
Joe.

47
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,090
And it's fucking crazy.

48
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,840
I am being distracted by how much I have
to urinate.

49
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,910
Oh,
the other day I was thinking about,

50
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,970
I'm glad gas just started man.
I know,

51
00:02:24,971 --> 00:02:27,080
but I was not prepared.
I had a water.

52
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:28,590
I drank a whole one of these.
Good.

53
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,580
And then I had Andre.
Yeah.

54
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,440
Stay healthy.
Uh,

55
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,230
and I had a bunch of coffee this morning
too,

56
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,300
but uh,
I was thinking yesterday,

57
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:37,240
this is related.
How much would you weigh if you never

58
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:40,270
went to the bathroom?
You'd be dead.

59
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,940
How quickly?
It wouldn't take long.

60
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,070
I mean,
what if we had evolved to just not ever

61
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:48,100
have to,
I like a baby after just a month would

62
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:52,690
be bigger than the biggest human ever.
I need to do the math.

63
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,210
Well,
it depends on what you need to consume.

64
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,630
Like,
if your body was so efficient that you

65
00:02:58,631 --> 00:03:01,660
no longer to urinate,
like we kind of assumed that your body

66
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:02,680
would need to urinate.

67
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,500
But why?
If your body needs water to stay alive,

68
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:08,290
like what,
why are we assuming that it has to

69
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,990
protest to get water waste?
That it doesn't have one anymore?

70
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,110
Well why could,
could we just turn that into more hair

71
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,540
instead?
But why does it have to get rid of

72
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,790
waste?
Like isn't it possible that we can

73
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:23,050
become so efficient that we no longer
need to get rid of waste and we can just

74
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:28,000
sort of exist by breathing completely.
Just like self.

75
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:28,770
Yeah.
We,

76
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:33,280
I mean to get to a certain size and once
we get to a certain size,

77
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,660
we just,
you know,

78
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,010
whatever you evaporate off by walking
around like that you have to take back

79
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:39,880
in.
Right.

80
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,020
I guess,
you know?

81
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,250
Yeah.
Cause they have,

82
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,100
you know,
robots that that just dissipate heat.

83
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,820
They don't have her make a waste
product.

84
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,900
Your laptop doesn't create as much waste
as a human,

85
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:52,300
but it's also not nearly as like
complex.

86
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,800
Right.
Uh,

87
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,300
but in some ways it's more complex.
They've been able to make machines that

88
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:01,660
can poop.
You put food in and then it's got

89
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:05,560
bacteria and different pumps and
reservoirs inside and it creates

90
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,880
something that resembles completely and
smells just like a human dump.

91
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,510
Whoa.
The first one I saw was done as a piece

92
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:17,470
of art as art work.
Like an artist created this machine that

93
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:20,300
could poop just like a human.
And uh,

94
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,570
now they do it ad they call it a Robo
Gut.

95
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:26,290
It's actually a medical thing because
when people have gi problems of poop,

96
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:30,430
transplant is commonly used to
reintroduce the healthy bacteria and

97
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,090
taking poop from someone else and giving
it to the sick person,

98
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,840
shoving it up.
There is kind of like,

99
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,570
you know,
there's a lot of possibilities for

100
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:38,680
rejection,
infection,

101
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:39,610
stuff like that,
I guess.

102
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,540
But the Robo Gut can make just perfectly
clean poop just with the kind that you

103
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,110
want.

104
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:44,970
Whoa.
Yeah.

105
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,820
You get some artificial poop put up
inside of you to fix any imbalances that

106
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:52,660
you have in your gut flora.
That's fast.

107
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:56,140
And that crazy can have like a poop farm
of robot intestine,

108
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,400
right?
That are just,

109
00:04:57,401 --> 00:04:59,220
and what do you feed them?
Yeah.

110
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,490
Digital digitally do burger runs for the
Robo guts and then they totally are.

111
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,710
It's got to be totally organic.
It's got to probably,

112
00:05:05,711 --> 00:05:08,800
it's probably just like a paste or a
liquid.

113
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,410
You'd be like baby food.
It wouldn't have to taste good.

114
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,710
The robot's not going to complain.
Yeah.

115
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,960
Fuck that robot.
Just eat it,

116
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:16,100
bitch.
Well,

117
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,370
you remember when Jay z went to Cuban
and got in trouble and everything,

118
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:23,240
the media was like,
oh look it does he know that that um,

119
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,390
fucking che hated black people and
you're like,

120
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,700
what are you talking about?
Like what is going on?

121
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,390
It was the weirdest and Che Guevara
Dialing 1964 or something with a Che

122
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,830
Guevara.
And he also went over to,

123
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,580
and Golan fought like the revolution in
Africa.

124
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:38,200
So it's like,
I don't know if that's really true,

125
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:41,020
but it's just so crazy.
He was the perfect guy though.

126
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:43,780
It'd be on a tee shirt.
He just looked like such a great

127
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:46,510
revolutionary.
I know people that wore a Che Guevara

128
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:49,060
tee shirt that didn't know Jack Shit
about,

129
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,600
remember there was that wave of Che
Guevara support that happened like,

130
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,930
like a decade ago or so.
I can know one body was really what they

131
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:58,070
were talking about.
You could look cool.

132
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:00,920
They have one,
a Che Guevara tee shirt on people that

133
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:04,100
Che Guevara Tattoos and it's like,
why?

134
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,920
What?
What about Che fucking Viva La

135
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,830
[inaudible]?
You know,

136
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,570
like the guy and he would have hated it.
I mean like the fact that he's become

137
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:16,310
this commercial figure would have been
like,

138
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:17,660
he wouldn't fucking hated that.
You know,

139
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:20,690
it's just funny that he's become this
icon of like capitalism.

140
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,040
What's a perfect example of these like
surface inquiries?

141
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,080
Like people just go to look at it like,
oh,

142
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:29,540
that guy was bad ass.
No,

143
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,420
no,
like looking into it at all.

144
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,330
No.
Trying to understand who he was or

145
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:38,480
knowing like deeply about who he was.
Yeah.

146
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,500
This is like a baby when you fucking
check.
