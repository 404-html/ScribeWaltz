1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,290
Good googly Mowgli,

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,190
ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:05,731
Uh,

4
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:09,930
this episode of the podcast is brought
to you by untuckit.com this is a new

5
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:13,140
sponsor and it's a new sponsor
has come up with a novel idea.

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,690
Everybody likes wearing
those button up shirts.

7
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:18,120
Like I was wearing a
flannel shirt earlier today.

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,440
Everybody likes wearing them,

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,900
but if you don't tuck them in,

10
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,580
they look kind of odd,

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,181
right?

12
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:27,150
There's like this little blanket that
goes over your Dick and your butt.

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,530
It's like a backwards hill.

14
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,220
Yeah.

15
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,860
Like the idea is that
you're moving around a lot,

16
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:32,611
so when you talk it,

17
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:33,600
it keeps it from untied.

18
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,100
But who the fuck talks their shirt in?

19
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,640
Especially if you don't have a job where
you have to Tuck your shirt in and like

20
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:39,630
if you're a banker,

21
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,580
he can't be wandering around
what your shirt untucked.

22
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,020
I'm not going to trust you with my cash,

23
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,660
but you don't even remember the
last time I tuck my shirt in.

24
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,860
I hate it that much.

25
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:47,061
Well,

26
00:00:47,061 --> 00:00:47,400
you're,

27
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:47,791
you know,

28
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:51,600
you have a unconditioned unconventional
job if you're a dude with a conventional

29
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:51,961
job.

30
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:52,630
Like if you,

31
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,010
uh,

32
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:53,430
you know,

33
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,540
I thought you were to say body,

34
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:54,910
but it's,

35
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,010
that's why I don't like the cut.

36
00:00:56,011 --> 00:00:56,401
Tuck it in.

37
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:58,680
I don't want to look like
a fucking grapefruit.

38
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,770
It's uncomfortable though being tucked.

39
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:01,860
He got you guys,

40
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,310
you know,

41
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,640
there's no,

42
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,330
not much space.

43
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,600
That's the thing that guys would go guts
do when they have their pants tucked

44
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:09,660
into and the gut is like firm
and tight against their pants.

45
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:10,410
Almost like a,

46
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,650
a bra for their gut when
it's tucked in it in.

47
00:01:13,651 --> 00:01:14,080
Yeah.

48
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,440
The way I,

49
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,220
that shit.

50
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:16,850
Right.

51
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:17,010
Yeah.

52
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,030
It's not a comfortable,

53
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,650
I'm much more comfortable with,

54
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:20,640
with shirts untucked,

55
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:22,290
but then there was
always that extra cloth.

56
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,680
Well this company untuck it
decided to figure that out.

57
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,190
They,

58
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,300
it's made exclusively for men
who wear their shirts untucked.

59
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:30,961
See,

60
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:33,690
know women won't be so excited
to wear your clothes either.

61
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,810
That's another good thing cause one of
the reasons why women like it because it

62
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:41,100
covers they've of JJ and their butt and
they can walk around with their legs or

63
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,450
legs hanging out more skin.

64
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,830
This will definitely show more skin,

65
00:01:43,831 --> 00:01:44,650
but you know,

66
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:44,870
it's,

67
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,050
it's going to show your whole vagina.

68
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:46,651
Let's be honest.

69
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:46,861
Look,

70
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:48,150
look at this guy's penis says,

71
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,170
that's crazy right there.

72
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,740
So it'd be less likely that chicks will
a wear your clothes or if they do wear

73
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:55,131
their clothes,

74
00:01:55,131 --> 00:01:56,130
they would have to wear underwear.

75
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,230
I feel like if I saw
this guy in the street,

76
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,020
I wouldn't even notice
anything different going on.

77
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:01,801
You know,

78
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:02,910
it just blends right in.

79
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,391
Yeah.

80
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:03,661
The,

81
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:04,170
the,

82
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,120
the brand ambassador is this guy,

83
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:06,841
Brad Richards,

84
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:08,490
who's a hockey star and he,

85
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:08,760
uh,

86
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,640
he decided to be a part
of the company as well.

87
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,860
It's because it's a novel and great idea.

88
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,080
Untuck it has solved the problem,

89
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:17,820
ladies and gentlemen made exclusively,

90
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,391
as I said,

91
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:20,040
for men who wear their shirts untucked.

92
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:20,880
And women too,

93
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,361
you can wear it,

94
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:22,194
especially if you're,

95
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,070
you know,

96
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,990
tend to be like more of
a manly sort of a woman,

97
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,100
which is nothing wrong with that.

98
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:26,880
Okay.

99
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,990
Fucking wear flannel.

100
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:30,240
Who gives a shit man
where whatever you want,

101
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,021
if you're hot,

102
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:31,501
by the way,

103
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:32,410
you could pull off Flan on.

104
00:02:32,411 --> 00:02:33,244
Nobody gives a shit.

105
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,230

106
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,070

00:03:14,191 --> 00:03:15,220
of all our sponsors,

132
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:17,360
it's one of the most
popular and it's just,

133
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,400

just a godsend.

137
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,111
It used to be,

138
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:26,470
it was so difficult to get a website
used to have to hire someone and that

139
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:29,890
person was probably busy as shit
and it takes massive man hours.

140
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,920
The man hours had been
significantly reduced.

141
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,080
And you can make an awesome
professional website,

142

00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:54,010
about as easy as attaching
a photograph to an email.

151
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:54,971
If you can do that,

152

what are the odds?

163
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:08,590
We didn't plan this.

164
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:08,891
Alan,

165
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:09,724

responsive design,

171
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:21,130
your site would look awesome on any
device and commerce on the online stores.

172
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,810
Every site comes with an online store.

173
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,240
Squarespace has a logo creator as well.

174
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:26,680
We can create a clean,

175
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,070
simple logo designed
for yourself in minutes.

176
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:30,581
Many,

177
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:32,530
many of our friends use Squarespace.

178
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,220
Um,

179
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,750
Duncan Trussell uses it.

180
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,330
Tom Sager and Christina
Pezeshki don't tell you is it?

181
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,670
I don't know.

182
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,440
I know I built Chrysler new shops,

183
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,210
death squad store on that recently.

184
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:42,561
Yeah.

185
00:04:42,561 --> 00:04:43,640
Brian uses it.

186
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,440
Kara Santa Maria uses it as so
many people use it and there's

187
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:49,220
looking at,

188
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,870
you got seat so you can plug
in on the front page there,

189
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:54,390
you can plug in your Instagram feed.

190
00:04:54,391 --> 00:04:56,100
So that's always fresh content.

191
00:04:56,101 --> 00:04:56,730
So,

192
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:56,910
uh,

193
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,790
if you're a person like me
and the majority of what
you do is on youtube or on

194
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:03,120
social networks and you don't want
to constantly be updating a website,

195
00:05:03,121 --> 00:05:05,910
one way to keep it current is
to use this Instagram plugin,

196
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,240
which feeds right back to
your Instagram feed obviously.

197
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,140
And so gives people a reason
to come back and check it out.

198
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,590
Maybe they don't use Instagram themselves.

199
00:05:13,591 --> 00:05:14,820
They can still see what you're up to.

200
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,420
Yeah,

201
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,140
yeah.

202
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,870
That's awesome.

203
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,190
Yeah.

204
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:17,490
Oh,

205
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:17,910
go back.

206
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,743
Look,

207
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,190
I had the hemp force on this.

208
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,970
See,

209
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,670
that's what I left with last time.

210
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,020
And now I'm on,

211
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:25,231
you know,

212
00:05:25,231 --> 00:05:25,801
I'm hooked up.

213
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm on the program now.

214
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:28,860
And uh,

215
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,760
unbox therapy

216
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,850
b.com is the website.

217
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,000
If you want to go and check
out Louis's awesome website.

218
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:40,001
Great reviews on all sorts of different
types of electronics and items and,

219
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,140
and homemade craft brew.

220
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,880
How's that crap beer thing?

221
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,550
That good that that was sent to me,

222
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:46,600
but I don't actually have it,

223
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:47,770
so I would just try it.

224
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:48,790
Try it again.

225
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,140
That's a great idea though.

226
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,600
I have a craft brew thing
and your house definitely.

227
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,520
This is actually cool here too.

228
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:54,911
Well,

229
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:55,744
this uh,

230
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,160
is all the different items and
stuff that I use that are in my,

231
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:58,520
uh,

232
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,230
personal inventory of items that
help make my videos possible.

233
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:03,800
Oh,

234
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,030
nice and beautiful.

235
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:05,600
That's cool.

236
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,410
And it's a plugin.

237
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,410
They linked back to the
Amazon store like ick.

238
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:10,940
Squarespace makes doing
super complicated things.

239
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:11,930
Incredibly easy to do.

240
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:12,860
Boom.

00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,251

A better web starts with your website.

249
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,473
That's their logo.

250
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,770
That's the shit that they say.

251
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,230
Everything else is like
basically my own words.

252
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:43,400
But a better web starts with your website.

253
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:44,863
That's them.

254
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,913
It could be worse.

255
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,790
It could be way worse.

256
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,993
Could be way worse.

257
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:48,351
All right.

258
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:50,480
We're also brought to you by
[inaudible] Dot Com it's o.

259
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:51,500
N.

260
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:51,500
N.

261
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:51,500
I.

262
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:51,501
T.

263
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:54,440
We dosed up Louis the last time he was
here and he had a dream that he was

264
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:57,020
hanging out with Brian Singer basically.

265
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,860
Plus the protein stuff kept me full.

266
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,730
You know what I mean?

267
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,151
I was,

268
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:02,541
uh,

269
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,800
about to start editing a video.

270
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:07,220
I took a big protein shake and I'm not
super healthy or anything like that,

271
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:09,620
but I stayed full for a long time.

272
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,551
I didn't want to get up.

273
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:11,570
I didn't want to snack.

274
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,831
I'm telling you,

275
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:13,900
I'm gonna take this shit seriously.

276
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,180
Like the pro I've had people recently
complained about the hem forest.

277
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,350
They don't like the way it tastes,

278
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,011
which is,

279
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:19,340
I dunno,

280
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,300
I guess it's subjective.

281
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,200
I just,

282
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:21,831
for the record,

283
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:23,570
I always mixed mine with coconut water.

284
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,160
I love chocolate though.

285
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,951
Chocolate's good.

286
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,510
Yeah.

287
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:26,751
Well,

288
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:28,400
it's also made with Stevia.

289
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:29,930
So it has very little sugar,

290
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:35,350
one gram of naturally occurring sugar
per serving if you're interested in hemp.

291
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:40,100
And especially like people said like why
is it so expensive are hamp is the best

292
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:40,730
hemp you can buy.

293
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,860
If you go to any store,

294
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:46,520
you can buy hemp protein powder and you
can compare the two of them between this

295
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:47,354
and hemp force.

296
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,230
And there's two,

297
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,100
two differences.

298
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:49,880
One,

299
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,140
the percentage of protein per serving
is much higher on the stuff that we buy

300
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,030
and we just bought the best
stuff that you can get.

301
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,410
It's not cheap.

302
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,290
We have to buy it from Canada
to unfortunately they're
starting to change that

303
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,124
law.

304
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,690
They're fighting against it.

305
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,070
They're going all the
way to the supreme court.

306
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:07,460
And in Kentucky there was
like some recent website,

307
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,570
there was a detailing
Kentucky's battle to uh,

308
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,190
to grow hemp,

309
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,750
which is non psychoactive,

310
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:15,081
by the way.

311
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:16,760
Completely nonsense not getting anybody.

312
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:17,450
Hi.

313
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:21,290
It's just connected to from
the beginning to marijuana.

314
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,470
And the reason being that
marijuana became illegal,

315
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,510
and this is really wacky stuff,

316
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,790
but it was because of hemp hemp,

317
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,850
the commodity hamp being used for paper,

318
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,780
hemp being used for cloth hemp
being used for food and for oil.

319
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,860
Henry Ford in fact made the very first
fenders of his very first car out of

320
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:40,460
hemp.

321
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,900
And there's a video online.

322
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:45,110
If you go to that video that you could
see Henry Ford banging on the fender with

323
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:45,944
a hammer.

324
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,970
Hemp is a crazy plan.

325
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,550
I mean is literally like,

326
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,990
it comes from another planet.

327
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,610
It's so different than anything else.

328
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,290
If you pick up a hemp stalk,

329
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,680
it's light,

330
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,600
but really hard,

331
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,550
like a piece of hemp stalk,

332
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:00,620
like a big thick of a,

333
00:09:00,621 --> 00:09:03,270
a hemp tree that grew a thick and large.

334
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:04,740
It's amazing how strong it is.

335
00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:05,341
It's weird.

336
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:07,080
It's like an alien plant you can eat.

337
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:09,000
It has all the essential fatty acids.

338
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:11,040
The protein in it is very,

339
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,480
very digestible.

340
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,380
Um,

341
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,030
like I said with with on it,

342
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:17,190
we try to use the best stuff available,

343
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:20,760
but you can buy hemp force
or hemp protein rather.

344
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,720
That's a cheaper variety from many
different sources and you can see the

345
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:25,171
difference.

346
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:27,540
You can see it and it will be more gritty.

347
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,020
Um,

348
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,210
it won't digest is easily prob probably,

349
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:32,550
and it probably won't have as
much protein per percentage,

350
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:33,390
but it's all good.

351
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:33,841
I mean,

352
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:34,021
look,

353
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:36,750
any hemp protein is one of
the best proteins you can get.

354
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,200
Um,

355
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,890
it's just,

356
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:38,370
it hasn't,

357
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,180
you're going to have less issues digesting
it then you will way some people have

358
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,290
no problem with way other
people are more sensitive.

359
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:49,410
My wife has waiver had whey protein
prior to this one showing up and we were

360
00:09:49,411 --> 00:09:53,400
comparing the nutritional values and
something I noticed on the hemp was the

361
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:54,234
fiber,

362
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,040
the fiber compared to the way,

363
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,300
well it's plant based.

364
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,130
It's like 11 grams or something.

365
00:09:59,131 --> 00:09:59,700
Yeah.

366
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,750
And you know,

367
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,290
I could have,

368
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,760
I could use the help everybody get fiber.

369
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,100
It's just good for your body.

370
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,180
Um,

371
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:06,631
anyway,

372
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:11,631
we carry that in a host of other healthy
snacks and foods like the warrior

373
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:12,900
protein bar,

374
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,801
which is a,

375
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:13,981
a,

376
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:16,110
a bar that's made out of Buffalo.

377
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:16,620
Uh,

378
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:21,480
it's made out of buffalo in this ancient
native American tradition that uses

379
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:24,540
cranberries and pepper
with no antibiotics,

380
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,980
no added hormones,

381
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,240
no nitrates,

382
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,220
and a totally gluten free,

383
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:30,810
although I don't know
why he would have gluten.

384
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,740
I guess you could maybe put wheat
somehow or another than a bar to make it

385
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:35,980
anyway.

386
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,600
Um,

387
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,400
what these bars are,

388
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:42,840
is essentially just a really healthy
protein snack that's totally natural.

389
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,010
Buffalo meat,

390
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:45,660
14 grams of protein,

391
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:50,010
and it's based on a recipe that has
been in the Lakota Sioux warriors for

392
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:52,650
century really can't call them Lakota.

393
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,180
Sioux Lakota is what they call themselves.

394
00:10:57,181 --> 00:10:58,490
Sue is with other,

395
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,700
other Indians would call them,

396
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:00,990
other native Americans would call them.

397
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,940
And Sue means it means enemy.

398
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,390
So calling them Lakota Sioux Warriors,

399
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,370
it's not really the correct verbiage.

400
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:09,060
Wow.

401
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,550
It's a Lakota people anyway.

402
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,020
The LAKOTA people,

403
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,550
they figured out a way,

404
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:14,911
you know,

405
00:11:14,911 --> 00:11:15,181
many,

406
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:15,391
many,

407
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:15,631
many,

408
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:15,931
many,

409
00:11:15,931 --> 00:11:20,640
many years ago to how to
preserve meat without a,

410
00:11:20,641 --> 00:11:24,480
all the modern shit that we use that
it was probably super bad for you.

411
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,770
So no MSG,

412
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:26,700
no lactose,

413
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,230
no nitrates as I said,

414
00:11:28,231 --> 00:11:29,730
which is the one thing that people really,

415
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,010
uh,

416
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,190
are very leery about when it comes to,

417
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,000
um,

418
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,300
uh,

419
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,560
food supplements,

420
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,551
not food supplement,

421
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:35,761
food,

422
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:39,300
snacks like a beef jerkys and
Salamis and things like that.

423
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:40,230
Things with nitrates,

424
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:41,010
hot dogs,

425
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:41,491
nitrates,

426
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:42,210
not so good,

427
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,320
no antibiotics as well,

428
00:11:43,321 --> 00:11:44,220
no added hormones,

429
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,510
all just super healthy.

430
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:45,811
And again,

431
00:11:45,811 --> 00:11:50,070
14 grams per servings
and only 140 calories.

432
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,650
A just one of the many
things that we have it on it.

433
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,411
Uh,

434
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:55,240
and also if you use the codeword Rogan,

435
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:57,850
you will save 10% off
any and all supplements.

436
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:58,630
Anything else before we get

437
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,020
cracking?

438
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,853
Y'All got anything on that?

439
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,940
Next weekend.

440
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,810
We're going to be at the Comic Con
America American Comedy Company,

441
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,220
a Wednesday and Thursday,

442
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:10,360
July 23rd and 24th bringing kill Tony
Thunderpussy and having a comedy show

443
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:11,350
there with Bert Kreischer.

444
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,040
Glorious Ladies and gentlemen.

445
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:19,041
Go to death squad.tv for all of that
information and a next Saturday night or

446
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,280
next Friday night.

447
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,140
I am with Tony Hinchcliffe.

448
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,220
We are in San

449
00:12:23,221 --> 00:12:28,221
jose@thecenterfortheperformingartsandalltheinformationforthatisthatjoerogan.net

450
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:29,940
under tour.

451
00:12:29,941 --> 00:12:32,490
Our right fuckers Lewis
from unbox therapy's here.

452
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:36,150
We're all hopped up on coffee
and speed and all kinds of shit.

453
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,043
Let's just do this.

454
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:39,680
Okay.

455
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,400
Pitch out Rogan experience.

456
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,470
Try by day Joe Rogan podcast all day.

457
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,260
Louis.

458
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,600
A lot of people don't want to think
you're on speed when you're on coffee,

459
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:51,710
but you're aligning yourself.

460
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,400
Ladies and gentlemen,

461
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,900
you're in a mild form of speed.

462
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:54,531
That's a good point.

463
00:12:54,531 --> 00:12:55,364
Drugs are everywhere.

464
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,560
You don't like a doctor.

465
00:12:57,561 --> 00:12:58,610
Carl Hart said,

466
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,920
you don't want a drug free America.

467
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,900
That's an unproductive Martha,

468
00:13:02,901 --> 00:13:03,130
right?

469
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,330
So I'll go with it.

470
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:05,600
With that coffee away from people.

471
00:13:05,601 --> 00:13:06,590
They're not working anymore.

472
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,281
It's amazing,

473
00:13:07,281 --> 00:13:07,710
isn't it?

474
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:10,160
Remember when you were young
and there was no Starbucks,

475
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:10,950
they didn't exist.

476
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:14,720
Like this is something like
that waiting for us out there.

477
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,441
The zero,

478
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:17,420
like a new thing that's going to just,

479
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,373
you know,

480
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,280
that's a good question.

481
00:13:19,281 --> 00:13:21,710
Some substance I was
coffee was there forever,

482
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,161
right?

483
00:13:22,161 --> 00:13:23,660
Marijuana before.

484
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,171
Yeah.

485
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:24,621
That's probably,

486
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:25,041
yeah,

487
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:25,874
it's capital yet.

488
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,200
Isn't that what's happening in Colorado?

489
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:27,591
Oh yeah.

490
00:13:27,591 --> 00:13:28,580
It's happening like crazy.

491
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,140
Right?

492
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,060
Carl Rogers going off Washington
state's going off now too.

493
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,470
Cause now they just started selling it.

494
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,660
So now the same ripple effect.

495
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,880
The same effect it's
happening in Colorado,

496
00:13:37,881 --> 00:13:40,900
which is they're making way more
money than they even planned.

497
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,230
Right.

498
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,210
They had like an idea of how much money
they would make and they're making way

499
00:13:44,211 --> 00:13:44,660
more,

500
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,493
way more now.

501
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,520
I mean,

502
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,240
well that's something
that has been tied up for,

503
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,370
for too long.

504
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:49,791
I think.

505
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:50,660
It makes a lot of sense.

506
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,550
Fascinating.

507
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,660
What a strange world we live in.

508
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,740
You know,

509
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,940
I mean now they have a,

510
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,100
have you seen the pot coin?

511
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,870
It is a digital currency
based on marijuana.

512
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:03,560
I get inevitable.

513
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,400
You gotta be able to buy marijuana
with his digital currency.

514
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,260
I think you need your own currency next.

515
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,120
That's when that's when the
government comes after you.

516
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,290
You got to stay low.

517
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,550
Jre Coin,

518
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,500
you got to stay free and
the unambitious that's true.

519
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:17,271
I know.

520
00:14:17,271 --> 00:14:18,320
Running for office,

521
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:18,771
no,

522
00:14:18,771 --> 00:14:18,981
no,

523
00:14:18,981 --> 00:14:20,150
trying to affect policy.

524
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,320
Nothing crazy.

525
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,780
But maybe coins can become that seriously.

526
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:28,781
Like where communities online could have
a coin almost as a reward system for

527
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:31,460
the best participants
within that community.

528
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:31,911
Well,

529
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:36,911
I think ultimately we will have digital
currency across the board for a variety

530
00:14:38,301 --> 00:14:41,750
of different things and it can
be really easy for communities,

531
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,410
whether it's online communities or
towns to set up their own money.

532
00:14:45,411 --> 00:14:47,720
Because I remember there
was a town and man,

533
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,340
I want to say like North Carolina,

534
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,210
but there was a town that was
in the news while back where,

535
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,253
um,

536
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,440
they had decided to
make their own digital,

537
00:14:57,441 --> 00:14:59,690
not digital currency but local currency.

538
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,870
And it was being talked about in the
news and it was like everybody sort of

539
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:06,380
agreed what things would be worth
and they would all have their own,

540
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:06,890
you know,

541
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:11,390
way of trading goods and selling things
and passing it back and forth to each

542
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:12,224
other.

543
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,100
I see that,

544
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,550
yeah.

545
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,470
That like as an online thing

546
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,500
be everywhere.

547
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:16,781
Yeah.

548
00:15:16,781 --> 00:15:19,500
It is the decentralization of the power,

549
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,280
you know,

550
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,360
why should some person in Missouri be
concerned with what guys on Wall Street

551
00:15:24,361 --> 00:15:24,870
are doing?

552
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,320
You know?

553
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:25,741
Yeah.

554
00:15:25,741 --> 00:15:26,510
Like what,

555
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:26,890
why,

556
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:27,141
how,

557
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:28,530
why is that affecting you?

558
00:15:28,531 --> 00:15:30,000
Why are you allowing it to affect you,

559
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:30,630
I guess?

560
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,610
Does it have to be all
international like this?

561
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,171
I don't know this,

562
00:15:34,171 --> 00:15:35,550
there's smarter people than me,

563
00:15:35,551 --> 00:15:38,220
that that's probably
something to say about that,

564
00:15:38,221 --> 00:15:39,290
but the,

565
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,740
when the bailout happened,

566
00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:41,340
right?

567
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,570
That was the conversation.

568
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:43,170
It was,

569
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:43,411
you know,

570
00:15:43,411 --> 00:15:45,530
dudes in suits taking money away from

571
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,280
dudes and plaid shirts.

572
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,190
Do you know Michael Shermer is,

573
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,080
no.

574
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,390
Was He famous skeptic?

575
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:52,710
Was he on the podcast?

576
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,300
No.

577
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:53,520
Oh,

578
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,050
you guys.

579
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:54,330
Okay.

580
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,320
He's a famous skeptic.

581
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:00,150
He wrote this very strange article for
scientific America that's been chewed

582
00:16:00,151 --> 00:16:00,984
apart.

583
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,441
And,

584
00:16:01,441 --> 00:16:02,070
uh,

585
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:02,730
uh,

586
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,090
it's,

587
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:07,140
it's interesting because
it's like his idea of a,

588
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,640
if you like Google,

589
00:16:08,641 --> 00:16:10,620
Michael Shermer Scientific America,

590
00:16:10,621 --> 00:16:11,890
he apparently writes a,

591
00:16:11,891 --> 00:16:16,891
a an article there and he's got this myth
of income inequality is like the title

592
00:16:18,451 --> 00:16:19,590
of the article.

593
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,910
And look,

594
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,990
this is how I know your
ideas about finance or dumb.

595
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,910
If I think they're dumb,

596
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,430
this is how I know
because I'm clearly dumb.

597
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,330
That's the litmus test.

598
00:16:30,331 --> 00:16:32,400
If I read your dumb shit and I'm like,

599
00:16:32,401 --> 00:16:32,551
Yo,

600
00:16:32,551 --> 00:16:37,551
this is some dumb shit that that's
when you know that your shit is off.

601
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,360
It's really strange.

602
00:16:39,361 --> 00:16:42,270
It's a weird analysis of the,

603
00:16:42,271 --> 00:16:43,104
um,

604
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,330
of the situation and uh,

605
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,540
the idea that here's,

606
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,560
here's like one quote,

607
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,210
almost all of our studies participants,

608
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:54,180
the authors conclude grossly
underestimated Americans,

609
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:59,130
average household incomes
and overestimated the
level of income inequality.

610
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:04,530
So both income inequality and social
mobility though not as ideal as we would

611
00:17:04,531 --> 00:17:08,460
like them to be in the land of equal
opportunity or not as large and in mobile

612
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:09,840
as most of us perceive them,

613
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,460
he's getting destroyed in the,

614
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,230
yeah,

615
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,760
whenever I see something like that,

616
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,880
I always wonder if it's the audience
dictating the message or the message being

617
00:17:20,161 --> 00:17:24,030
authentic because I always wonder who
are the people reading this magazine?

618
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:25,290
They're probably fairly well off,

619
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,030
right?

620
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:26,780
[inaudible] scientific,

621
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,200
American American or whatever.

622
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,610
So aren't you?

623
00:17:29,611 --> 00:17:34,200
Isn't it easier to reinforce what they
want to hear then it is to start stir

624
00:17:34,201 --> 00:17:34,880
something up?

625
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,391
I don't know,

626
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:36,260
but when I've read this,

627
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:38,570
this is when I read something
that's so goofy like this.

628
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:41,150
This is obviously like
a libertarian slant.

629
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:41,991
You know,

630
00:17:41,991 --> 00:17:44,420
there's a lot of people that they,

631
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,050
they,

632
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:50,050
they lean libertarian and libertarian
almost has like a bit of a conservative

633
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:56,400
context to it or a conservative bend to
it because it's a lot of that things are

634
00:17:56,401 --> 00:17:58,050
not as bad as everyone is perceiving.

635
00:17:58,051 --> 00:17:59,640
Pull yourself up by your bootstraps.

636
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,540
The ability to,

637
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:01,240
you know,

638
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,230
to have more freedom will equal more,

639
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:04,440
you know,

640
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,160
less regulation and more freedom
will equal more prosperity.

641
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,420
It's online,

642
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,290
it's an ideology.

643
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,150
It's an ideology as much as being a
conservative is as much as being a liberal

644
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:19,470
is like sometimes people that get on
that one team and then they just sort of

645
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:21,250
adopt the ideas and the inclinations.

646
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,460
Right.

647
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,293
Team.

648
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,270
So this seems like what he's doing,

649
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:25,850
and this is again coming from Warren,

650
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,240
this seems like a very libertarian
in its slant and it just,

651
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,970
whenever someone does something like this,

652
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:33,480
I,

653
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,840
it makes me question like all
the things that they think about,

654
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,410
like you're supposed to be a guy
who points out logical fallacies.

655
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,970
He's involved in critical thinking,

656
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:44,550
objective reasoning and you
say something like this.

657
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:45,384
It's like,

658
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,141
no,

659
00:18:46,141 --> 00:18:46,610
there's,

660
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,570
there's crazy inequality in this country.

661
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,870
I mean that's the night that is insane.

662
00:18:50,871 --> 00:18:55,190
That's exactly what I was going to say
is I think the separation between rich

663
00:18:55,191 --> 00:18:57,050
and poor is such an obvious thing.

664
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,101
I mean,

665
00:18:58,101 --> 00:19:00,020
how can you dispute it?

666
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,080
I watched,

667
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,750
I can't remember the name of
the documentary right now,

668
00:19:02,751 --> 00:19:04,160
but it followed a couple of people,

669
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:09,161
silicon valley type a entrepreneurs and
tracked their incomes relative to those

670
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:15,140
of individuals within the company
and the sort of ratio over time,

671
00:19:15,141 --> 00:19:15,740
how those,

672
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,670
how those have changed.

673
00:19:16,671 --> 00:19:18,410
But if you look at technology,

674
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,470
which is sort of the,

675
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,380
the angle that I'm looking at it from,

676
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:25,610
the whole intent more often than
not is to build in efficient,

677
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,680
like build efficiencies into your process.

678
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,720
So if you're Amazon,

679
00:19:29,721 --> 00:19:30,554
for example,

680
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,960
figure out a way to run your
warehouse without people.

681
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,460
Figure out what figured out a way to
have robots do to automate all of it,

682
00:19:37,461 --> 00:19:37,820
right?

683
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,430
Because essentially your bottom line is
affected by how much you cannot like,

684
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,150
like the automakers for example,

685
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,410
get robots in there that,

686
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:45,710
you know,

687
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:50,710
their technologies appears to push in
this direction of eliminating humans from

688
00:19:51,261 --> 00:19:55,670
the equation where it becomes tougher
to pinpoint where the actual value is

689
00:19:55,671 --> 00:19:56,740
being added in,

690
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,220
in the product that you're receiving.

691
00:19:58,221 --> 00:20:00,590
So it's not like Amazon warehouses
don't have humans in them.

692
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,350
They do and they're creating jobs
and they can go around and say,

693
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:04,280
we open a new warehouse,

694
00:20:04,281 --> 00:20:06,980
so we hired 200 people
or whatever it might be,

695
00:20:06,981 --> 00:20:09,440
but once upon a time
without the automation,

696
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:10,640
how many people would that have been?

697
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,511
Yeah.

698
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:12,470
And what is going to happen

699
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,353
then when they,

700
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:13,571
I mean,

701
00:20:13,571 --> 00:20:15,700
are they really testing
drones for delivery?

702
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,140
That's not bullshit.

703
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:17,441
I,

704
00:20:17,441 --> 00:20:18,370
that's not bullshit.

705
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,233
I mean it's not,

706
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,680
I think it's not nearly as close
as the video makes it seem,

707
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,840
but just the idea that there's the idea,

708
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:27,190
the idea that it's not,

709
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,453
it's going to happen.

710
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,790
It's like when they first made those
photographs where you put the hood on and

711
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:33,890
you stood up there and don't,

712
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:34,680
oh,

713
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,220
they had that thing and like was it
like 1850 or something like that?

714
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:38,710
Yeah.

715
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,610
The time between that and having
it in your pocket was inevitable.

716
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,673
It's definitely,

717
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,090
all those ideas are out there.

718
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,620
Someone just has to them.

719
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,310
Definitely.

720
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:52,660
So once we have drones that there are
testing that a delivering products,

721
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:57,780
it's a matter of time before the skies
are filled with robot delivery trucks

722
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,570
that are,

723
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,460
they're landing places and dropping off

724
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,221
TV's.

725
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:03,890
And definitely I think the last time
we were here we're talking about self

726
00:21:03,891 --> 00:21:06,070
driving cars and how it,

727
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,140
like in an airplane it's okay
for that process to be automated.

728
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:10,670
But in cars we freak out about it.

729
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,950
He said he didn't think it's
the same thing with drones.

730
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,930
People are afraid of what they don't know,

731
00:21:14,931 --> 00:21:15,950
afraid of the unknown.

732
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,460
But maybe drones are a
little bit further out.

733
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:23,450
But what's happening right now is also
interesting and exciting and it's kind of

734
00:21:23,451 --> 00:21:26,180
flying under the radar
in the sense that you're,

735
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,220
you have a Amazon prime,

736
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:29,240
you have Amazon fresh,

737
00:21:29,241 --> 00:21:33,830
you have all these ways of getting things
that you need without necessarily the

738
00:21:33,831 --> 00:21:34,664
same,

739
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,270
uh,

740
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,200
the same ecosystem,

741
00:21:36,201 --> 00:21:39,470
the same same chain that you once would
have had where you had a delivery man

742
00:21:39,471 --> 00:21:42,980
brings it to a store and then the person
in the store puts it on the shelf and

743
00:21:42,981 --> 00:21:45,890
then you have to go to the store to buy
it and you have to go through a cashier

744
00:21:45,891 --> 00:21:47,240
instead of an automated checkout.

745
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,780
Just a number of human beings involved
in that process used to be a lot more,

746
00:21:50,781 --> 00:21:53,810
so everybody in that value chain could
take a little piece for themselves.

747
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,330
But in this Amazon universe,

748
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,620
it's all about eliminating those
cogs and just doing a to B.

749
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,090
So yeah,

750
00:22:02,091 --> 00:22:04,280
a drone is maybe the end game,

751
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,600
but even right now,

752
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,490
there's a huge impact to that,

753
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,020
that form of consumption.

754
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:09,991
Yeah,

755
00:22:09,991 --> 00:22:10,824
it's,

756
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:11,340
it's,

757
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:16,340
it's so strange to wash the climate
shift and change and it's so strange to

758
00:22:16,741 --> 00:22:18,450
watch just online shopping.

759
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,740
Remember I,

760
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:22,110
I did some online shopping a year ago.

761
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,100
I mean not a year ago.

762
00:22:23,101 --> 00:22:24,210
A while ago rather.

763
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,170
And um,

764
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,400
I forget what it was that I bought,

765
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:26,971
but somebody said,

766
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:27,481
where'd you get that?

767
00:22:27,481 --> 00:22:27,691
I said,

768
00:22:27,691 --> 00:22:29,400
I got online and he was like,

769
00:22:29,401 --> 00:22:29,791
Oh man,

770
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:30,960
I wouldn't buy anything online.

771
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,160
Put your credit card out there.

772
00:22:32,161 --> 00:22:33,120
That's how long ago was that?

773
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:33,850
Long time ago.

774
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:34,060
Okay.

775
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,290
Yeah,

776
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:34,560
I mean,

777
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:34,870
um,

778
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,370
I was on when,

779
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,400
when online shopping first existed,

780
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,263
I was buying things.

781
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:39,930
I was just like,

782
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:40,920
this is so crazy.

783
00:22:40,921 --> 00:22:41,460
So cool.

784
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,660
You could find something
online then shows up in your,

785
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,271
I think that,

786
00:22:45,271 --> 00:22:45,690
um,

787
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:50,690
now it's almost more common to shop
online than it is to not shop online.

788
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,560
Yeah.

789
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,340
I mean,

790
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,990
I don't know why mom still,

791
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:58,280
I would never put my credit card on
there and my mom's not like super old,

792
00:22:58,281 --> 00:23:00,040
but I think that word,

793
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,460
we just do it.

794
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,790
So we think everyone does well and
it depends on the item as well.

795
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,591
What percentage?

796
00:23:05,591 --> 00:23:06,424
Let's take a guess.

797
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,890
What percentage of Americans shop on?

798
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,943
I'd say

799
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,470
60% Oh,

800
00:23:12,471 --> 00:23:15,200
that actually do it at all frequently.

801
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:15,831
Frequently?

802
00:23:15,831 --> 00:23:17,900
I'd say 50 to 60% what's free?

803
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:18,690
What's frequently?

804
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,520
Once a week.

805
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:19,971
First of all,

806
00:23:19,971 --> 00:23:21,350
if you tied once a month,

807
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,630
if you type in what
percentage of Americans,

808
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,820
the first question is are gay,

809
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,620
what does that tell you about
people using Google search?

810
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,470
What percentage of
Americans are gay is first?

811
00:23:33,471 --> 00:23:34,950
What percentage are Christians?

812
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,910
Second though?

813
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,300
Is that really that strange
if you think about it,

814
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:38,960
yes.

815
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,400
Do you have the answer to that question?

816
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,090
The gay part?

817
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:41,923
Yeah.

818
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,131
How close?

819
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,690
How close would we ask everyone's gay.

820
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:46,130
Even

821
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:46,963
enough time?

822
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,260
Yeah.

823
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,130
Everyone's gay.

824
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,180
You just need enough time.

825
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,780
I'm just curious what that top
till the search is a common search.

826
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:56,000
I'm just curious what the
top result actually is.

827
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,300
No.

828
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,133
Wikipedia.

829
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,620
What do you think based
on your own findings?

830
00:24:00,621 --> 00:24:02,630
Like the people I see in America,

831
00:24:02,631 --> 00:24:04,940
so I don't have enough
experience with all of America.

832
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:05,601
Just humans.

833
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:06,051
Canada.

834
00:24:06,051 --> 00:24:06,331
You,

835
00:24:06,331 --> 00:24:07,550
you guys are American north?

836
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,160
No,

837
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,511
I know,

838
00:24:08,511 --> 00:24:09,260
but I'm saying,

839
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,980
I'm talking more about urban
urban areas versus rural areas,

840
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,630
royals,

841
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,463
they're all gay.

842
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,040
All those farmers are as fuck.

843
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:17,470
They might not even know.

844
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,111
That's what I'm talking about.

845
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:18,530
Like I have,

846
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,390
I have city experience.

847
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:21,980
I don't have any country experience.

848
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,940
Do you think it's different?

849
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,620
I think they hide anymore.

850
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:25,410
In fact,

851
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:30,210
the city country thing is more
defining than than say the city.

852
00:24:30,211 --> 00:24:30,751
You come from.

853
00:24:30,751 --> 00:24:31,200
Like people say,

854
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,291
oh,

855
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:34,080
somebody from Chicago is like this and
somebody from New York is like that.

856
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:34,741
In fact,

857
00:24:34,741 --> 00:24:35,140
I've,

858
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:39,060
I've been in marketing meetings where
they have specific terms for those urban

859
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:39,900
type of people.

860
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,370
And you're talking about black folk?

861
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:41,810
No,

862
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:41,920
no,

863
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,130
no,

864
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:42,221
no,

865
00:24:42,221 --> 00:24:42,281
no,

866
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:42,341
no,

867
00:24:42,341 --> 00:24:42,560
no.

868
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,700
Not Eric got Canadian.

869
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,030
No,

870
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:44,990
not urban like that.

871
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,853
But I mean,

872
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:47,540
I mean the life

873
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:51,650
experience of a person who lives in a
high rise versus the type of person who

874
00:24:51,651 --> 00:24:52,610
has a few acres.

875
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,860
It's a totally different life experience.

876
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:59,120
And therefore the culture that you
participate in is going to be a little bit

877
00:24:59,121 --> 00:24:59,780
different.

878
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,790
So when people say to me,

879
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,330
for example,

880
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:02,630
Oh,

881
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,350
you know,

882
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,183
you're Canadian,

883
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,600
you been to Toronto a lot,

884
00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:05,901
so you know,

885
00:25:05,901 --> 00:25:07,400
it's roughly the same kind of idea.

886
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,710
But when you ask me a question like that,

887
00:25:09,711 --> 00:25:14,711
statistically I would say Toronto was
probably more like New York then New York

888
00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:16,730
is like Kansas City.

889
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:17,271
Right.

890
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:17,900
You know what I'm saying?

891
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,231
Yeah.

892
00:25:18,231 --> 00:25:19,280
I agree with you on that.

893
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,383
Except folks.

894
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:20,840
Well,

895
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,060
the,

896
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:25,580
the big difference between Canadians and
Americans is how nice everybody is this

897
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:25,881
way.

898
00:25:25,881 --> 00:25:28,850
More nice people for whatever
reason he thinks of urban centers.

899
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:29,980
Yeah,

900
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,340
I know.

901
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,090
I know.

902
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,620
I noticed people say,

903
00:25:32,621 --> 00:25:33,371
excuse me in,

904
00:25:33,371 --> 00:25:33,980
sorry a lot

905
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,300
more that has me,

906
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:35,871
sorry.

907
00:25:35,871 --> 00:25:36,850
Pardon me.

908
00:25:36,851 --> 00:25:38,840
High doing smiling smile.

909
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,790
It's just a friendlier place that happens.

910
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,390
I feel like it's probably because you
don't have this background of Congress,

911
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,161
you know,

912
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:47,090
it's a different beast.

913
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:50,030
It's a different kind of
mentality that set up the country.

914
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:50,570
Yeah.

915
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:53,540
Where's the America is definitely
different culture for sure.

916
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,190
Definitely close it.

917
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,120
Oh Yay.

918
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,310
Take a little bit twisted,

919
00:25:57,311 --> 00:25:57,731
sort of,

920
00:25:57,731 --> 00:25:58,151
you know,

921
00:25:58,151 --> 00:25:58,841
and again,

922
00:25:58,841 --> 00:26:00,460
it varies depending on where you are,

923
00:26:00,461 --> 00:26:01,810
but one of the,

924
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,960
one of the things that comes
up more than anything has guns,

925
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,220
gun,

926
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:06,670
the gun,

927
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:11,110
the difference in the
perception of gun crime,

928
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:11,770
et Cetera.

929
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,110
That conversation always
comes up when I'm talking to,

930
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,070
you know,

931
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:18,640
people from America that asking
me what the differences and that,

932
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,180
uh,

933
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,220
famously that Michael Moore documentary,

934
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,121
what the hell?

935
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:22,954
Which one was it?

936
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,240
His one of his first ones.

937
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:26,890
But bowling for Columbine.

938
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,491
Was it bowling?

939
00:26:27,491 --> 00:26:28,280
Bowling for Columbine?

940
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:28,770
Yeah.

941
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:29,603
Where he,

942
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:34,050
he's from Michigan and he went over
the border to Windsor from Detroit.

943
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,371
And I don't know,

944
00:26:35,371 --> 00:26:38,280
he had some statistics in there and
people weren't locking their doors in

945
00:26:38,281 --> 00:26:38,761
Windsor.

946
00:26:38,761 --> 00:26:39,301
And I don't know,

947
00:26:39,301 --> 00:26:40,970
he had a lot of people
thought that that was hard.

948
00:26:40,971 --> 00:26:42,180
She thought it was horse shit too.

949
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,100
But he trying to draw some

950
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,730
kind of conclusion there that even
though we're culturally identical,

951
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,541
we don't shoot each other,

952
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:49,770
which obviously is not true,

953
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,150
but some of the statistics coming out
of Chicago right now are crazy as far as

954
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:58,470
the amount of people that are
dying due to gang warfare,

955
00:26:58,471 --> 00:26:58,831
et cetera.

956
00:26:58,831 --> 00:27:01,050
Like there's nothing like that at all.

957
00:27:01,051 --> 00:27:01,831
So I don't know.

958
00:27:01,831 --> 00:27:02,910
There isn't like that in Canada.

959
00:27:02,911 --> 00:27:03,510
No,

960
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,230
no.

961
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,490
I think Toronto,

962
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,680
I don't want to say a
number because I don't know,

963
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,180
but murder figures,

964
00:27:09,181 --> 00:27:12,930
I mean it's one of the safest and Rob
Ford think I've kept you guys to say,

965
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:14,040
but doing all your crack.

966
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,950
That's what he does is spin
it off the street strategy.

967
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,210
Hanging out with the thugs.

968
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:18,511
Yeah.

969
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:21,530
He was trying to calm everybody down
towards overweight white people.

970
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,440
Is that the prince,

971
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:23,400
that book about,

972
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,511
I don't remember,

973
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:26,370
but a king needs to be
down with the people.

974
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:30,780
You see the minute he gets up on his high
horse up on a hill somewhere to go for

975
00:27:30,781 --> 00:27:31,141
crack,

976
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:32,430
he can't relate anymore.

977
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,110
That's what I'm saying.

978
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,810
For New up under a Free Rob Ford.

979
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:37,590
That's what I say.

980
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,440
I think he's running again.

981
00:27:38,441 --> 00:27:41,490
He's running a porn star actually.

982
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,110
Perfect.

983
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:42,920
The world's gonna.

984
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,320
Yup.

985
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,153
It's fucking late.

986
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:46,740
Perfect.

987
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,490
Nikki Benz.

988
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:52,350
That's the perfect kind of way
to look at politics is that if,

989
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,740
if these people can be there
and nothing actually happens,

990
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,250
there's no actual effective.

991
00:27:57,251 --> 00:27:57,360
It,

992
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:57,560
it,

993
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,240
it for me it exposes politics as a whole.

994
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:00,700
Well,

995
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,970
politics given the state of our culture,

996
00:28:02,971 --> 00:28:05,220
I think the most intelligent,

997
00:28:05,221 --> 00:28:08,280
most capable people don't want that job.

998
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,680
I decided no,

999
00:28:10,681 --> 00:28:14,790
I'll just get some puppet and place to
do my bidding and pay them off or you

1000
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:14,911
know,

1001
00:28:14,911 --> 00:28:16,590
it's obviously not that planned out.

1002
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:18,600
It's like one guy's
pulling strength scores,

1003
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,020
but therefore most people,

1004
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,350
they don't want a job that
doesn't pay that well.

1005
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,510
It's going to take a shit
load of your time and uh,

1006
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,660
everyone's going to hate
you no matter what you do.

1007
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:28,261
Yeah.

1008
00:28:28,261 --> 00:28:28,650
What,

1009
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,441
who wants that job?

1010
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,000
That's smart.

1011
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,420
I mean,

1012
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,253
that's the problem.

1013
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:31,590
I mean,

1014
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,550
we have real issues.

1015
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,370
All right.

1016
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,180
It's saying actually the Americas,

1017
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,750
uh,

1018
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,040
there's,

1019
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,880
there's several different
articles about shopping online,

1020
00:28:38,881 --> 00:28:39,900
what the numbers were,

1021
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:42,450
but it's overtaking stores.

1022
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:47,750
It's saying now 40% 47% of consumers
said the internet would be their favorite

1023
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:50,400
shopping destination.

1024
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,040
Wow.

1025
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,680
Yeah.

1026
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:57,680
Here's in 2013 it says more than 80%
of the online population has used the

1027
00:28:57,991 --> 00:28:59,310
internet to purchase something.

1028
00:28:59,311 --> 00:29:00,420
So at least once,

1029
00:29:00,421 --> 00:29:02,430
and that's the only people
that have used the internet.

1030
00:29:02,431 --> 00:29:03,420
So that of all,

1031
00:29:03,421 --> 00:29:05,370
I'd probably say it'd be lower.

1032
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,500
I'd probably say like 60 globally.

1033
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:07,740
Like,

1034
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:07,890
yeah,

1035
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,090
there's something we don't have access.

1036
00:29:09,091 --> 00:29:11,190
Like how about how many
people shop on their phone?

1037
00:29:11,191 --> 00:29:11,761
What would you say?

1038
00:29:11,761 --> 00:29:13,860
They're all that's growing rapidly.

1039
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,270
I know that for a fact,

1040
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:15,850
uh,

1041
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:20,160
I don't know the number seven out of
10 smartphone owners will use their

1042
00:29:20,161 --> 00:29:22,170
smartphone for holiday shopping.

1043
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:22,740
Wow.

1044
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,960
Finding store locations and checking,

1045
00:29:24,961 --> 00:29:29,910
comparing prices being the top two uses
with 45% of the consumers saying they

1046
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:33,120
use social media to assist them
with their holiday shopping.

1047
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,440
Definitely fascinating.

1048
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:39,180
I think social media is a huge,

1049
00:29:39,181 --> 00:29:39,661
huge,

1050
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:42,550
huge factor in buying electronics.

1051
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:43,660
Huge mean,

1052
00:29:43,661 --> 00:29:46,300
we're talking your friend Marcus Marquez,

1053
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,500
Marquez who uh,

1054
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:49,360
also has a videos online.

1055
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,330
Great.

1056
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,530
Really in detail videos
about cell phones especially.

1057
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,180
He's helped me a lot of,

1058
00:29:55,181 --> 00:29:58,150
I really enjoyed his videos that
I was talking to him about it.

1059
00:29:58,151 --> 00:29:58,451
I was like,

1060
00:29:58,451 --> 00:30:00,370
there's never been a
thing like this before.

1061
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:00,900
No.

1062
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,950
And they uh,

1063
00:30:01,951 --> 00:30:02,940
they actually,

1064
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:05,340
we were involved in some report recently.

1065
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:05,670
Uh,

1066
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,110
it was at some university report.

1067
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,170
Um,

1068
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,270
I'm not remembering the name,

1069
00:30:09,271 --> 00:30:13,800
but they did some tallying to figure out
how many people watch videos like that

1070
00:30:13,801 --> 00:30:15,270
prior to making a purchasing decision.

1071
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,170
The percentage in,

1072
00:30:16,171 --> 00:30:16,801
in our world,

1073
00:30:16,801 --> 00:30:17,521
in the tech space,

1074
00:30:17,521 --> 00:30:18,360
it's huge.

1075
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:18,800
One,

1076
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:18,941
the,

1077
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:23,941
the numbers were staggering and so this
is really awkward thing going on right

1078
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:29,310
now where the influencers are
becoming the retailers in a way.

1079
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,870
We're taking on that role where it used
to be a guy in a blue shirt at best buy

1080
00:30:33,871 --> 00:30:35,400
who could give a shit about the job,

1081
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:39,450
who you kind of had to deal with
whatever information he had,

1082
00:30:39,451 --> 00:30:40,500
you didn't have a choice.

1083
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,210
And now it's like,

1084
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,560
why would we,

1085
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,730
it's not very,

1086
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:49,200
it's not the best use of resources
to take a bunch of unsophisticated

1087
00:30:49,201 --> 00:30:53,130
individuals with a part time
job and put them in that role,

1088
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:55,560
which is essentially a
fairly sophisticated role.

1089
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,910
Just keeping up with all this shit,

1090
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,773
which is crazy.

1091
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,550
So let's take one guy,

1092
00:30:59,551 --> 00:31:03,780
give him video as a platform and
then allow for him to reach millions.

1093
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,080
And it's also the difference between
someone taking on that role as a job and

1094
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:12,390
someone who's extremely
passionate about electronics.

1095
00:31:12,391 --> 00:31:13,410
Completely agree with that.

1096
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,300
That's for you.

1097
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,480
Like a guy like you,

1098
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,500
you would probably,

1099
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:17,460
no matter what your job is,

1100
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:19,260
you would still be
passionate about electronic

1101
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,220
100% I'd still be having the
exact same conversations.

1102
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,220
Sometimes I,

1103
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,210
I feel like I might even
be more passionate because
I wouldn't be jaded by the

1104
00:31:26,211 --> 00:31:26,601
whole thing.

1105
00:31:26,601 --> 00:31:27,141
You know what I mean?

1106
00:31:27,141 --> 00:31:27,280
Like,

1107
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,960
I think in a weird way that might happen,

1108
00:31:29,961 --> 00:31:30,570
but,

1109
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:30,870
uh,

1110
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:31,281
you know,

1111
00:31:31,281 --> 00:31:31,640
there's,

1112
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,870
there's definitely,

1113
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:36,560
there's definitely this change happening
right now where social media is

1114
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:40,580
allowing for individuals who you don't
know in your personal life to take on the

1115
00:31:40,581 --> 00:31:41,240
role,

1116
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:41,590
uh,

1117
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:44,600
where that used to be for
somebody connected to you,

1118
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,410
you know,

1119
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,670
immediately connected to you.

1120
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:47,690
Now the,

1121
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:48,980
the word of mouth marketing,

1122
00:31:48,981 --> 00:31:50,090
which is a scent was,

1123
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,380
which was the most powerful,

1124
00:31:51,381 --> 00:31:52,760
is still the most powerful,

1125
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,460
is transitioning from word
of mouth in real life.

1126
00:31:55,461 --> 00:31:58,100
Real words to social media words.

1127
00:31:58,101 --> 00:32:02,360
Because even though you might be
unreachable to people in real life,

1128
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,160
you're not because of social media.

1129
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:04,820
So I'll,

1130
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,680
so Joe Rogan is an influencer.

1131
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,571
I'm an influencer.

1132
00:32:07,571 --> 00:32:10,660
Marquez is an influencer
and all of a sudden you're,

1133
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,580
you're managing this social
group of a million friends.

1134
00:32:13,581 --> 00:32:13,911
Essentially.

1135
00:32:13,911 --> 00:32:15,050
That's the way they look at it.

1136
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:17,120
You're building that connection.

1137
00:32:17,121 --> 00:32:18,740
You have this two way communication.

1138
00:32:18,741 --> 00:32:20,750
You're producing hundreds of videos,

1139
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,760
you're pumping out hundreds of tweets.

1140
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:23,271
It's,

1141
00:32:23,271 --> 00:32:23,780
uh,

1142
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,160
you,

1143
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,310
you take on a different role.

1144
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:25,360
Wow.

1145
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,700
And you're super responsible in a way.

1146
00:32:27,701 --> 00:32:27,941
Like,

1147
00:32:27,941 --> 00:32:30,150
say if you choose a certain phone,

1148
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,570
it turns out to be a piece of shit.

1149
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:31,750
He's,

1150
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:31,961
Oh,

1151
00:32:31,961 --> 00:32:36,961
for sure the massive burden on you
that would destroy to be unjustly.

1152
00:32:37,301 --> 00:32:40,930
Like there was no way it would be worth
it because it would kind of like stain

1153
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,410
you for it

1154
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:41,920
ever.

1155
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,280
Like your people's perceptions
of your judgment and you know,

1156
00:32:45,281 --> 00:32:46,720
and most importantly if you're,

1157
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,030
if you grew up invested in this,

1158
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:49,361
you know,

1159
00:32:49,361 --> 00:32:52,630
like I did like just wanting to
get my hands on the next thing.

1160
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:53,410
It's,

1161
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:54,910
if you're actually excited,

1162
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,380
it's super hard to fake it.

1163
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,190
You know what I mean?

1164
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:59,080
It's a fake it eat one
way or the other way.

1165
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,313
It's,

1166
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,870
there's something about the format,

1167
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,190
the third party format,

1168
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:03,911
like brands,

1169
00:33:03,911 --> 00:33:07,570
they'll put up their own videos without
a feature video on your product.

1170
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:08,620
Nobody wants that.

1171
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:13,920
Nobody wants your super polished version
of the way you want the thing to be

1172
00:33:14,171 --> 00:33:15,004
interpreted.

1173
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,330
Uh,

1174
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,620
in conversations I've had,

1175
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:18,550
it's like I'm,

1176
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,220
I'm playing the like
unboxing videos in general.

1177
00:33:21,221 --> 00:33:22,690
I'm playing the role of view.

1178
00:33:22,691 --> 00:33:24,700
That's why traditionally
they were shot point of view,

1179
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,800
point of view because it's your head,

1180
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,390
you're about to go experience this.

1181
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:31,030
And when I was playing around
with the Google Cardboard Vr,

1182
00:33:31,031 --> 00:33:31,864
I was like,

1183
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:32,853
Oh shit,

1184
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:38,190
can you imagine this idea being expanded
on of consumption through someone else?

1185
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:44,470
Experience having experiences that will
be unavailable to you through someone

1186
00:33:44,471 --> 00:33:45,580
else's perspective.

1187
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,630
Because oftentimes I'm playing with
items that people don't have the money to

1188
00:33:49,631 --> 00:33:50,351
buy and not,

1189
00:33:50,351 --> 00:33:51,400
at least not immediately.

1190
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,400
They may be thinking about it or they may
just be watching it for entertainment.

1191
00:33:54,401 --> 00:33:55,600
There's all kinds of different viewers,

1192
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,800
but I can imagine being a kid really
wanting something and the closest I could

1193
00:33:59,801 --> 00:34:02,560
get to it was that
experience of getting it,

1194
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:07,090
opening it Cetera and imagining
that perspective of as being mine,

1195
00:34:07,091 --> 00:34:07,720
you know?

1196
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,370
Well the unboxing videos are always
very cool because you know you get to,

1197
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,790
you get a real sense of
the product like from,

1198
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:18,850
from the purchase to your
hands to discovering it.

1199
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,490
Whereas like other times you like you,

1200
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:21,490
the guy already has it out.

1201
00:34:21,491 --> 00:34:22,750
It's already each fully charged.

1202
00:34:22,751 --> 00:34:23,080
He's,

1203
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,070
he knows how to work it.

1204
00:34:24,071 --> 00:34:26,350
So he's swiping back and forth
and showing you all the things.

1205
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:31,120
But you would never be able to talk a
producer of a television show into letting

1206
00:34:31,121 --> 00:34:34,780
you film 20 minutes on
a fucking new LG phone.

1207
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:35,231
They would go,

1208
00:34:35,231 --> 00:34:36,064
no one's going to watch.

1209
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:36,880
No.

1210
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,430
Uh,

1211
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:37,860
I,

1212
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,860
I have heard of,

1213
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,630
I think maybe it was virgin,

1214
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,411
somebody put,

1215
00:34:41,411 --> 00:34:44,050
put some tech videos in the airplanes,

1216
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,220
which were kind of extended in,

1217
00:34:46,221 --> 00:34:47,054
in length.

1218
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,130
I don't know.

1219
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,630
People would definitely watch them.

1220
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:50,860
The world is changing.

1221
00:34:50,861 --> 00:34:51,280
You know,

1222
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,061
it's totally changed.

1223
00:34:52,061 --> 00:34:53,500
Those producers that are in that,

1224
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,431
in that business,

1225
00:34:54,431 --> 00:34:55,270
in that world,

1226
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,860
maybe they couldn't understand it,

1227
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,630
but the audience and the numbers,

1228
00:34:58,631 --> 00:34:59,464
they don't lie.

1229
00:34:59,680 --> 00:34:59,861
Well,

1230
00:34:59,861 --> 00:35:01,930
the content delivery device of television,

1231
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:05,470
like Tara's going to be on at eight
o'clock and can go from eight to nine and

1232
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:06,970
that's when you gotta be there or Dvr it.

1233
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:07,910
I have to,

1234
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,200
I love this conversation.

1235
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,760
I feel like it's not,

1236
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:13,280
it's not us who need
to be adapting to them.

1237
00:35:13,281 --> 00:35:14,240
It's them that need to be adapted

1238
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:14,870
us.

1239
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:15,021
Well,

1240
00:35:15,021 --> 00:35:16,130
there's no need.

1241
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:21,220
As technology has started to change what
online video is and now you have like

1242
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:25,070
Netflix documentaries and television
shows and comedy specials.

1243
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:25,420
What?

1244
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,770
What is the difference between something
that's on Netflix and something that's

1245
00:35:27,771 --> 00:35:28,490
on television?

1246
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,323
It's,

1247
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,520
it seems the same thing to me and that's,

1248
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:35,270
it's becoming more and more prominent
and it's going to get to a point where

1249
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:38,430
it's going to eclipse it because
they don't have the limitations

1250
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,380
of you have to watch it this time.

1251
00:35:40,381 --> 00:35:40,921
It's only on,

1252
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:44,210
then you've got to sit through commercials
and all this silly limitation you're

1253
00:35:44,211 --> 00:35:44,610
dealing with,

1254
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:48,570
with a more sophisticated
delivery system and in the past,

1255
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:52,200
sophisticated evolutions of
systems are never held back.

1256
00:35:52,201 --> 00:35:53,100
You can't stop them.

1257
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:54,300
You can try and like,

1258
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,830
where's blockbuster?

1259
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:56,843
Yeah,

1260
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:57,670
they fucked up.

1261
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:00,760
There was a bunch of dudes sitting
around a table like this with gray hair

1262
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,920
saying people like to go and rent a movie.

1263
00:36:02,921 --> 00:36:03,820
You know it's an outing.

1264
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,060
That's what they like to do.

1265
00:36:05,061 --> 00:36:05,471
Do it,

1266
00:36:05,471 --> 00:36:06,760
and then the wife gets to pick.

1267
00:36:06,761 --> 00:36:07,570
That's right.

1268
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:08,041
That's right.

1269
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:11,710
Each day that husband gets to pick
on ones during tonight's mine.

1270
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,150
I like the classics,

1271
00:36:13,151 --> 00:36:13,841
the classics.

1272
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:15,760
For seven day rentals and late fees.

1273
00:36:15,761 --> 00:36:16,720
Do you remember late fees?

1274
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,660
Can you believe that we
put up with that shit?

1275
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:20,501
I'll do you one better.

1276
00:36:20,501 --> 00:36:21,820
How about rewind fees?

1277
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,490
Whoa.

1278
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,080
Now I can't go with you there.

1279
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,310
I can't get that far back.

1280
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,050
Remember the rewind fees?

1281
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,061
That was bullshit.

1282
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:32,240
That was so you don't rewind and they're
charging you and charge you money.

1283
00:36:32,241 --> 00:36:33,460
If you didn't roll on the ditch,

1284
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:34,670
rewind the video.

1285
00:36:34,671 --> 00:36:35,120
You're like,

1286
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,451
ah,

1287
00:36:35,451 --> 00:36:36,370
I think I did.

1288
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,221
And then they look at it.

1289
00:36:37,221 --> 00:36:38,054
No you didn't.

1290
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:40,490
It's like who's considering
user experience?

1291
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:41,121
They're like,

1292
00:36:41,121 --> 00:36:42,770
how about some customer service?

1293
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,281
Well,

1294
00:36:43,281 --> 00:36:43,521
you know,

1295
00:36:43,521 --> 00:36:46,820
my friend figured out that most of the
time the people that work at blockbuster

1296
00:36:46,821 --> 00:36:51,110
or way too dumb to know whether
it's fully watched or fully rewound,

1297
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:52,640
they would like look at it.

1298
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,440
So what he would do is just fast forward
it to the very end and then say it's,

1299
00:36:57,441 --> 00:36:57,621
look,

1300
00:36:57,621 --> 00:36:58,400
it's totally rewound.

1301
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:58,731
They would go,

1302
00:36:58,731 --> 00:36:58,901
oh,

1303
00:36:58,901 --> 00:36:59,734
okay.

1304
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,130
Because they didn't know
if it was real loud,

1305
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,410
couldn't where does it go like that?

1306
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:07,940
Or is it like this?

1307
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:08,990
Like where's,

1308
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:09,890
which is the start?

1309
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,250
Does it go clockwise?

1310
00:37:11,251 --> 00:37:12,220
Is it go okay?

1311
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,060
Getting back to that
conversation about the,

1312
00:37:15,061 --> 00:37:15,570
uh,

1313
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,700
about the internet as a delivery method.

1314
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:18,690
Uh,

1315
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:19,231
there's this,

1316
00:37:19,231 --> 00:37:22,470
this thing happening now we're online
content creators with really large

1317
00:37:22,471 --> 00:37:24,960
audiences are getting
approached by traditional media.

1318
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,261
You know,

1319
00:37:25,261 --> 00:37:26,010
they,

1320
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,790
they are wanting to bring them over
into that world to try and generate some

1321
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:33,840
interest in traditional
media to an audience that
generally isn't interested in

1322
00:37:33,841 --> 00:37:34,674
that content.

1323
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,950
And the prob there's,

1324
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,750
there's problems occurring where those
people aren't translating and vice versa,

1325
00:37:39,751 --> 00:37:41,790
or they're trying to mold
them into something else.

1326
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:45,510
There's a lot of really big
content creators that have
branched out in that way.

1327
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,820
And there's some sort of
feeling like once you've got,

1328
00:37:47,821 --> 00:37:48,810
once you're on TV,

1329
00:37:48,811 --> 00:37:49,440
you've made it,

1330
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,273
you know,

1331
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,980
which is still appealing
to a lot of people,

1332
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:53,730
but not,

1333
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,310
not at all for me because when I see it,

1334
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:56,790
like,

1335
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:57,750
like I said before,

1336
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:01,650
a more sophisticated delivery
system I want for me,

1337
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:06,750
we've won when we've convinced them that
when we've convinced them to come work

1338
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:07,230
with us,

1339
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,160
not the other way around,

1340
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:08,880
you know,

1341
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,750
and uh,

1342
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:11,820
and I feel like there's a lot of people,

1343
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,350
there's a lot of people that
are undermining how cool
all of this is by taking

1344
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:18,870
their services and saying and saying,

1345
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:19,350
Oh,

1346
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:19,790
I'm going to,

1347
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:22,590
I'm not going to upload on my channel
as much anymore because I have a show on

1348
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:26,730
this channel or because I'm working
with this brand or because I'm in

1349
00:38:26,731 --> 00:38:27,541
commercials now,

1350
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:28,170
or whatever it is.

1351
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,480
And that's a real thing that's happening.

1352
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,653
Youtube stars.

1353
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:31,741
That's fascinating.

1354
00:38:31,741 --> 00:38:35,010
So big youtube stars at getting
lured into the dark side.

1355
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:35,700
That's right.

1356
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,550
They pulled over.

1357
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:37,860
That's right.

1358
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,150
Real control that content.

1359
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:40,840
But that's right.

1360
00:38:40,841 --> 00:38:41,770
We'll give you pasted these

1361
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,670
coins from the bottom of the mountain.

1362
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:52,080
That is a real thing because their
whole business is based around control.

1363
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:55,390
They have to control the
assets like record deals,

1364
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,800
think about record deals,

1365
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:57,970
music companies,

1366
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:59,890
all that shit got overhauled.

1367
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:00,720
Why heard does,

1368
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,320
I don't know what podcast company it is,

1369
00:39:02,321 --> 00:39:04,330
but one of the podcast networks got sold.

1370
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:08,020
It got sold to some radio
conglomerate or some shit like that.

1371
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,160
I remember when that happened.

1372
00:39:09,161 --> 00:39:09,551
I was like,

1373
00:39:09,551 --> 00:39:09,970
wow,

1374
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:10,661
that's weird.

1375
00:39:10,661 --> 00:39:13,000
Why would they want to
buy a podcast network?

1376
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,220
Nerdous it.

1377
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,370
Then they get bought by a like Warner
brothers or some kind of form a Warner

1378
00:39:18,371 --> 00:39:19,000
brothers.

1379
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,200
Find out what the actual,

1380
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:20,471
well,

1381
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:21,010
who cares?

1382
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,050
I mean I let him do
whatever he wants to do.

1383
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:23,620
I've had,

1384
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,300
I've had offers to buy my channel.

1385
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,780
Really sell that with pursed
lips and that's right.

1386
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,180
You said that very in serious tones.

1387
00:39:31,181 --> 00:39:31,840
That's right.

1388
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,081
Yeah.

1389
00:39:32,081 --> 00:39:32,381
Well,

1390
00:39:32,381 --> 00:39:32,591
hey,

1391
00:39:32,591 --> 00:39:33,640
it's worth a lot of money.

1392
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,320
A lot of people are checking it out.

1393
00:39:35,321 --> 00:39:37,000
We can just change the
way you look at things.

1394
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:37,361
Louis,

1395
00:39:37,361 --> 00:39:38,470
you just a little too critical.

1396
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,040
Like,

1397
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,490
why are you so mean when it comes to
certain devices that could generate

1398
00:39:42,491 --> 00:39:47,491
millions of dollars if you just flavored
your came imagined that life being that

1399
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,650
person though really just a shell,

1400
00:39:50,651 --> 00:39:51,280
you know?

1401
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:51,581
Well,

1402
00:39:51,581 --> 00:39:52,420
it's also,

1403
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:55,570
it's completely contrary to
what you're passionate about.

1404
00:39:55,571 --> 00:39:57,250
What you're passionate
about is innovation.

1405
00:39:57,251 --> 00:39:59,380
Where you're passionate about
is the consumer experience.

1406
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,540
Like I was kind of a really interested,

1407
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:03,670
or the last conversation that we had you,

1408
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,760
you were talking about
the user experience,

1409
00:40:06,761 --> 00:40:07,630
the UAE,

1410
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:10,030
which I had never really
thought of as a concept,

1411
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,980
but it is,

1412
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,640
it's not just a user interface,

1413
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:13,540
but it's the experience.

1414
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:16,060
How does it make you feel
to finish beveled edges,

1415
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:19,390
the Polish Smith last
box that it comes in.

1416
00:40:19,391 --> 00:40:19,931
Yeah.

1417
00:40:19,931 --> 00:40:21,070
What is all that about?

1418
00:40:21,071 --> 00:40:25,900
And that's something that you only would
sort of get if you are truly passionate

1419
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,040
about this.

1420
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,030
Let's look at Apple.

1421
00:40:28,031 --> 00:40:28,630
I mean they,

1422
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,130
they're trying to control the experience.

1423
00:40:30,131 --> 00:40:32,020
Start to finish from
the retail perspective.

1424
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:35,350
There's a difference between walking
into an apple store in a Verizon store.

1425
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:35,801
Yeah.

1426
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:36,280
The apple,

1427
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,120
they've got it nailed.

1428
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,380
They do have that nail.

1429
00:40:38,381 --> 00:40:38,561
They,

1430
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,580
everything looks apple.

1431
00:40:39,581 --> 00:40:40,414
Lee,

1432
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:40,841
you know,

1433
00:40:40,841 --> 00:40:41,860
you go into the apple store,

1434
00:40:41,861 --> 00:40:42,750
it's totally APP.

1435
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:47,800
I feel like we shouldn't go off on apple
talk again because people get suck.

1436
00:40:47,801 --> 00:40:48,840
It sucks.

1437
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,511
It is.

1438
00:40:49,511 --> 00:40:51,880
The reality is that they
make the best laptops.

1439
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,470
They make the best desktops,

1440
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,730
they make the best phones.

1441
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,160
They just do that.

1442
00:40:56,161 --> 00:40:57,250
The android phones,

1443
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:01,090
the best thing about the android phones
is that they're open is that anybody

1444
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:02,560
could make things for them.

1445
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,180
Is that the screens are bigger,

1446
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:04,811
is that,

1447
00:41:04,811 --> 00:41:05,410
you know,

1448
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:07,210
there's a lot that you
could watch flash on them.

1449
00:41:07,211 --> 00:41:09,970
There's a lot of really positives
when it comes to android phones,

1450
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:14,080
but when it comes to like who has made
an android phone that can fuck with an

1451
00:41:14,081 --> 00:41:14,530
iPhone,

1452
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:18,280
the closest is like that HTC
m eight and I've had that.

1453
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:21,090
It's good on camera.

1454
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:21,820
You see one?

1455
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:21,971
Yeah,

1456
00:41:21,971 --> 00:41:22,480
it's good.

1457
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,740
Actually me and mark has to be,

1458
00:41:23,741 --> 00:41:27,010
did an inadvertent camera test
out the window of our hotel.

1459
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,533
We'd check in.

1460
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:29,411
He's three,

1461
00:41:29,411 --> 00:41:30,640
four floors above me,

1462
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:35,300
so I'm 12 he's 15 we both the
exact same photo unknowingly.

1463
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,820
I use a five s he uses the MH,

1464
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,020
right,

1465
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:42,080
and we both post to Instagram
sec within seconds of each other.

1466
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:46,490
Izea mine go live and right underneath
I see his and you should check out.

1467
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,413
I'll show you the results.

1468
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:48,530
It's,

1469
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:51,230
I've seen a bunch of the results
from videos like Marcus's,

1470
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,573
I'll show you the results.

1471
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,570
It's obvious.

1472
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:55,460
The iPhones have a better camera.

1473
00:41:55,461 --> 00:41:56,121
It's a better,

1474
00:41:56,121 --> 00:41:57,800
it's a slicker design.

1475
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:58,101
It's,

1476
00:41:58,101 --> 00:41:59,390
there's a lot of great things to it,

1477
00:41:59,391 --> 00:41:59,961
but damn,

1478
00:41:59,961 --> 00:42:00,794
Android's fucker.

1479
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,640
It's close.

1480
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,180
Okay,

1481
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,080
so really cool.

1482
00:42:03,081 --> 00:42:03,914
Check this out.

1483
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,660
Just scroll down to the next one.

1484
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,030
That's the iPhone five s on the top.

1485
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:09,860
We took,

1486
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,630
we essentially took the
St and then scroll down.

1487
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:12,110
God.

1488
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:12,943
And that's the man.

1489
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,820
Oh my God.

1490
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,080
That's incredibly different.

1491
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:16,860
Look at all the devotees.

1492
00:42:16,861 --> 00:42:19,520
It's not at the same time because the
sun is different than the horizon.

1493
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:19,821
No,

1494
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:20,420
dude,

1495
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:20,721
come on.

1496
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:21,380
Really?

1497
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,180
That's within seconds of one another.

1498
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,253
That's insane.

1499
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:25,160
Look at the deed.

1500
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:25,940
How come yours?

1501
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:26,611
Like look at you.

1502
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:27,620
You'd see your son.

1503
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:29,900
It doesn't show any like black.

1504
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:31,850
What does that the bill flare.

1505
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:32,870
The flare flare.

1506
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:33,860
But look at his flair.

1507
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,430
Yup.

1508
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,030
And look at,

1509
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:37,910
the interesting part for me is if you
scroll down a little more and you look in

1510
00:42:37,911 --> 00:42:39,140
the shadow portion,

1511
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,930
there's no detail in the MH shadows.

1512
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:42,803
It's terrible.

1513
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:43,730
It was like shit.

1514
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:44,511
You go up to the mind,

1515
00:42:44,511 --> 00:42:47,960
look at the detail where the cars are
parked and that building in the forefront.

1516
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:48,680
Yeah.

1517
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,490
That is fascinating that you guys
did that accidentally and then yeah,

1518
00:42:52,491 --> 00:42:53,040
because it,

1519
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,520
it just goes to show you like the,

1520
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:55,970
the mindset,

1521
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:56,601
you know,

1522
00:42:56,601 --> 00:42:59,600
like we both saw the cool shot where
like I'm going to take the shot and,

1523
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:01,130
and the difference in the output.

1524
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,023
Yeah.

1525
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,900
This sort of the context
of the user experience,

1526
00:43:05,901 --> 00:43:06,171
like the,

1527
00:43:06,171 --> 00:43:07,130
the passionate,

1528
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:07,993
you know,

1529
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:12,260
a person who's into a
electronics that can't,

1530
00:43:12,261 --> 00:43:13,094
you can't fake that.

1531
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:13,933
You can't know.

1532
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:14,883
It is,

1533
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,070
that's why it's so hard.

1534
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:19,970
There are so many users or
guys like us that really,

1535
00:43:19,971 --> 00:43:22,070
really like the interface on stock.

1536
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:23,660
Android like we talked about last time,

1537
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:26,690
I have a nexus with me as
well pretty much all the time.

1538
00:43:26,691 --> 00:43:30,620
But it's so hard to ditch the iPhone
because when you want to make a photo,

1539
00:43:30,621 --> 00:43:32,570
when you want to communicate
through photography,

1540
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:36,170
there's just no other way
right now and not theirs.

1541
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:39,920
That's Sony one that takes very high
mag and the one that has the extra,

1542
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,710
extra big fat land.

1543
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,520
The Nokia one,

1544
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,140
there's no,

1545
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:43,850
that's what it is.

1546
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:45,290
Is there a Sony that has that as well?

1547
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,380
The Sony's have some great cameras
to Sony is a waterproof one.

1548
00:43:48,381 --> 00:43:48,650
Right.

1549
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:49,550
That's to have a waterproof,

1550
00:43:49,551 --> 00:43:50,690
totally waterproof phone.

1551
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:51,703
Definitely.

1552
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,030
Why is this not waterproof?

1553
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,090
That's a good question.

1554
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:58,400
That's a stupid back back when back then,

1555
00:43:58,430 --> 00:43:59,080
like when the,

1556
00:43:59,080 --> 00:43:59,871
this really hasn't,

1557
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,990
the body hasn't changed
much since the five right?

1558
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,560
Back then it really wasn't a thing.

1559
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:04,580
People weren't making it.

1560
00:44:04,581 --> 00:44:05,000
It just,

1561
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,230
it's relatively recent.

1562
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,800
Samsung's is a IP rated
for dust and water.

1563
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:10,280
Uh,

1564
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:10,940
so is,

1565
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,020
I don't know if HTCs is,

1566
00:44:12,021 --> 00:44:13,400
but definitely Sony's is,

1567
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:15,320
it's a relatively new thing
that that's happening.

1568
00:44:15,321 --> 00:44:15,771
They can go like,

1569
00:44:15,771 --> 00:44:15,951
you know,

1570
00:44:15,951 --> 00:44:17,480
a meter underwater for 10 minutes.

1571
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:19,190
Hey,

1572
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,470
the next one might be
the next one might be,

1573
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:22,191
but it's not,

1574
00:44:22,191 --> 00:44:23,180
it's for them.

1575
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,620
That's not a huge priority.

1576
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:25,190
It,

1577
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:26,630
this doesn't seem like a huge product.

1578
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,810
Everybody gets their phone
ruined by pouring a drink on it.

1579
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:31,950
Like that's the number one
reason phones get ruined.

1580
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,930
I would say cracked screens.

1581
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,560
Toilet,

1582
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,380
I would take cracked screens
are probably higher than water,

1583
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,350
but they're both high
speeding of cracked screens.

1584
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:41,370
Cracked screens.

1585
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:42,121
Almost universal,

1586
00:44:42,121 --> 00:44:42,440
right.

1587
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,100
It doesn't everybody
get a cracked screen of,

1588
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:44,970
I've never had one,

1589
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:47,360
but I've had to move a Turd
to get my phone out of,

1590
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:48,443
out of the toilet.

1591
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,130
Did you kill the phone or the phone?

1592
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:51,420
Survive phones or vive.

1593
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:51,980
How,

1594
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:52,920
how long was it English?

1595
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:58,320
It literally like I got up and then
it fell in the toilet and I was like,

1596
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:00,660
God put my hand through
her and grabbed it,

1597
00:45:00,661 --> 00:45:02,430
pulled it out and then,

1598
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:03,440
and then uh,

1599
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:04,810
write it off,

1600
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:07,740
put it in a bag of rice now he
didn't even wash his hands as fuck.

1601
00:45:07,741 --> 00:45:07,890
No.

1602
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:10,890
Now I did the shaky thing
and it's good enough though.

1603
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:11,993
Hairdryer.

1604
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:12,720
Oh really?

1605
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,440
What you should do if that happens
is 24 hours in a bag of rice.

1606
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,110
Yeah.

1607
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:17,580
It'll,

1608
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,440
it'll pull away where the moisture would.

1609
00:45:19,441 --> 00:45:20,600
I usually ended up just doing it,

1610
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:24,810
then having something stopped working
and then take it to the APP or call the

1611
00:45:24,811 --> 00:45:27,360
apple store and they will
send you one with that.

1612
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:28,590
Apple's great with that.

1613
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:30,180
Here's the weird things though.

1614
00:45:30,181 --> 00:45:30,780
They put,

1615
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,680
or at least they used to,

1616
00:45:31,681 --> 00:45:32,280
I don't know anymore.

1617
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,710
I used to do like some
repairs on these things,

1618
00:45:34,711 --> 00:45:36,420
crack them open and get crazy like that,

1619
00:45:36,421 --> 00:45:40,500
but they used to put little litmus paper
in there that would show if it got wet

1620
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:41,400
every turn red.

1621
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:42,720
He used to be in the headphone Jack.

1622
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:43,141
I don't know.

1623
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:44,380
They probably are still doing it.

1624
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,283
He's still do it,

1625
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:47,160
but if you call they don't,

1626
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:48,420
there's no way from the check.

1627
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,713
Here's a question.

1628
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,100
When you say if you drop
something in the toilet,

1629
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:52,940
you drop the phone in the truck,

1630
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:55,230
should you shut it off and
throw it in the bag of rice?

1631
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:55,561
Oh,

1632
00:45:55,561 --> 00:45:56,700
should you leave at all times?

1633
00:45:56,701 --> 00:45:57,870
It turns itself off.

1634
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:58,501
But yeah,

1635
00:45:58,501 --> 00:45:58,801
if you,

1636
00:45:58,801 --> 00:45:59,890
if it's still on to turn it,

1637
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:00,773
turn it off,

1638
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:01,643
shut it off,

1639
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:02,693
shut it off,

1640
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:03,990
throw it in the bag of rice.

1641
00:46:03,991 --> 00:46:04,824
Yeah.

1642
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:07,290
What I usually do is just
suck the water out of it.

1643
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:08,790
But,

1644
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:09,320
but,

1645
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:09,660
but,

1646
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,250
but I wasn't going to do
it with the poop ones,

1647
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:11,720
right?

1648
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,120
Yeah.

1649
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:12,953
Why not?

1650
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,560
It's gross because when you suck it up,

1651
00:46:16,561 --> 00:46:17,520
if you look at your iPhone,

1652
00:46:17,521 --> 00:46:19,320
like there's the top part where the,

1653
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:20,183
the,

1654
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:22,140
where your ear usually goes,

1655
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,730
but there's water that's in there.

1656
00:46:23,731 --> 00:46:26,730
So you stuck that and you're
like pretty much sucking earwax.

1657
00:46:26,731 --> 00:46:27,564
It's gross.

1658
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:28,320
I never,

1659
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,620
I never thought of on my
phone ever jump into that.

1660
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,500
You mean like I go like
really hard many times.

1661
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:35,191
Have you done this?

1662
00:46:35,191 --> 00:46:36,330
Probably like five times.

1663
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,320
So where's your phone?

1664
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,550
Where's your ear going that
you're getting ear wax on them?

1665
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,160
If you look,

1666
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:42,661
if you look,

1667
00:46:42,661 --> 00:46:45,960
there's like a little grill that's right
there and if you look really close,

1668
00:46:45,961 --> 00:46:47,490
you could actually see
their shit in there.

1669
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:49,710
I was thinking about the Jack itself.

1670
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,870
I know you have to suck all of them.

1671
00:46:51,871 --> 00:46:54,720
There's the bottom one that you
suck and you suck that power.

1672
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,070
Does that work?

1673
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:57,480
Can you really suck the water out?

1674
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:57,631
Well,

1675
00:46:57,631 --> 00:46:58,260
it really helps.

1676
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,040
It's what I've always done.

1677
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,210
You mean getting,

1678
00:47:00,211 --> 00:47:03,480
getting water away from it is
going to be a positive thing,

1679
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:06,960
but the guy on the phone,

1680
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,080
customer service here,

1681
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:10,770
Dude,

1682
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:11,603
listen,

1683
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,320
I've been sucking on my phones.

1684
00:47:13,321 --> 00:47:13,830
That cool.

1685
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:16,620
I'm just taking it in the
most polite way possible.

1686
00:47:16,621 --> 00:47:17,490
I wouldn't recommend it.

1687
00:47:17,491 --> 00:47:17,940
No.

1688
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,320
Here's the answer to our other question.

1689
00:47:19,321 --> 00:47:23,010
1.7% of American adults
identify as gay or lesbian.

1690
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:28,550
1.7 C I had heard 10% that's the gays.

1691
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,010
They just want you to

1692
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:30,880
think that everyone's gay,

1693
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:31,451
right?

1694
00:47:31,451 --> 00:47:31,870
Yeah.

1695
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:32,151
God.

1696
00:47:32,151 --> 00:47:32,470
Damn.

1697
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:33,700
Tough stat to get though.

1698
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,433
Who's taking that?

1699
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:36,400
It's a good question.

1700
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:41,230
It's a really good question because what
percentage of gays are in the closet

1701
00:47:41,231 --> 00:47:42,010
versus out?

1702
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:43,090
That's a good question.

1703
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,213
I would wonder,

1704
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:47,650
what do you think again,

1705
00:47:47,651 --> 00:47:48,880
impossible stat to get.

1706
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:51,090
I would say 50 50 yeah.

1707
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,630
Just take 20 friends that
you know and then think,

1708
00:47:53,631 --> 00:47:53,831
all right,

1709
00:47:53,831 --> 00:47:55,360
how many of those 20 people are gay?

1710
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:56,230
How many people are those?

1711
00:47:56,231 --> 00:47:57,340
Do you think are in the closet?

1712
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:58,174
How many?

1713
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:00,100
Just like how it tastes.

1714
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:02,110
We all know a few people
that are in the closet.

1715
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:02,590
Yeah.

1716
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:03,423
Everybody goes,

1717
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:04,303
yeah,

1718
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:07,690
in public figures to speculate on.

1719
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,740
It's really sad.

1720
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,200
It's sad when someone was in the closet.

1721
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:15,160
Do you know when you got a guy who's a
friend like Justin Martin Dale who's out

1722
00:48:15,161 --> 00:48:17,170
and happy and silly about it,

1723
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,160
you know,

1724
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,300
and nobody judges them.

1725
00:48:19,301 --> 00:48:22,810
It's like it's no different
than judging someone who,

1726
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,620
you know,

1727
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,390
likes to drive a certain kind of car.

1728
00:48:25,391 --> 00:48:26,224
So I'm like,

1729
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:27,340
why did he give a fuck?

1730
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:27,701
It's just,

1731
00:48:27,701 --> 00:48:28,534
it's a weird,

1732
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:29,853
does it?

1733
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:32,140
Is it more the individual though?

1734
00:48:32,141 --> 00:48:36,640
Like is it possible that
somebody experienced is
exactly the way they want it

1735
00:48:36,641 --> 00:48:37,660
without coming out like his kid?

1736
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:40,360
Could it be that there's too
much pressure to come out to,

1737
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:41,920
sure they could definitely.

1738
00:48:41,921 --> 00:48:42,820
There's a lot of factors.

1739
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:46,990
I think it's all depends
entirely on your environment,

1740
00:48:46,991 --> 00:48:47,970
your family,

1741
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:49,600
religious background,

1742
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:51,070
where you grew up.

1743
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,600
If you grew up in San Francisco,

1744
00:48:52,601 --> 00:48:53,950
it's probably pretty easy to be gay.

1745
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:55,600
If you grew up in Kentucky,

1746
00:48:55,601 --> 00:48:56,950
it's probably pretty hard to come out.

1747
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:57,311
You know,

1748
00:48:57,311 --> 00:49:00,570
you're in a fucking deer stand
with a bunch of buddies and go,

1749
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:01,120
hey man,

1750
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:01,901
some shit.

1751
00:49:01,901 --> 00:49:03,760
I'm mean to get off my chest,

1752
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:05,223
you know,

1753
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:08,860
all listening to Garth Brooks songs and
shit and like one of you just happens to

1754
00:49:08,861 --> 00:49:09,331
be gay.

1755
00:49:09,331 --> 00:49:10,720
Like that guy's fucked man.

1756
00:49:10,721 --> 00:49:10,880
Yeah.

1757
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,170
He leaves the community at that point.

1758
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:13,780
That's weird.

1759
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:14,591
You know,

1760
00:49:14,591 --> 00:49:19,591
if we had a situation where one of our
comedian friends came out as gay out of

1761
00:49:19,601 --> 00:49:20,080
nowhere,

1762
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,820
like say if already
just decided to tell us,

1763
00:49:21,821 --> 00:49:22,654
you know what got

1764
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:27,090
pretty sure I'd be like,

1765
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:28,103
Whoa,

1766
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,200
that's weird.

1767
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:30,100
Okay,

1768
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:30,371
wait,

1769
00:49:30,371 --> 00:49:33,430
you had that one guy on
this guy you 10% gay.

1770
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:34,211
Oh,

1771
00:49:34,211 --> 00:49:35,080
Brody Brody.

1772
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:35,770
Yeah.

1773
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:37,810
He's 84% determined.

1774
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,880
What would Ari with a lisp sound like?

1775
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:41,260
We wouldn't have a list.

1776
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,230
It sounds like I'm coming
out of the closet guys.

1777
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:45,370
Darren talking normal.

1778
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:47,651
It happens.

1779
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:47,891
Joe.

1780
00:49:47,891 --> 00:49:48,221
I think.

1781
00:49:48,221 --> 00:49:48,701
I think,

1782
00:49:48,701 --> 00:49:51,250
I think once you're out you
can start to enhance it.

1783
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:51,731
I think it,

1784
00:49:51,731 --> 00:49:52,061
yeah,

1785
00:49:52,061 --> 00:49:52,631
I think cause you,

1786
00:49:52,631 --> 00:49:54,490
you hide it and you breathe it in.

1787
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:54,851
You know,

1788
00:49:54,851 --> 00:49:56,740
you tried to hide your gayness,

1789
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:57,381
but once it's out,

1790
00:49:57,381 --> 00:49:57,641
it's like,

1791
00:49:57,641 --> 00:49:58,001
oh my God,

1792
00:49:58,001 --> 00:49:58,720
I'm so ready.

1793
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:58,841
Well,

1794
00:49:58,841 --> 00:50:02,320
some gay guys would totally disagree
with that because it's gay guys that like

1795
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:03,940
really gay men,

1796
00:50:03,941 --> 00:50:08,941
like really lispy feminine gay men and
gay men that like men that are men who

1797
00:50:09,461 --> 00:50:11,140
like other men and they don't talk.

1798
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,000
Gail.

1799
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,833
Yeah,

1800
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:13,963
that's tough.

1801
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,220
Girl was gay.

1802
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:19,330
You know the girl was living
with a guy who looked across,

1803
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:20,360
you're like him Christ.

1804
00:50:20,361 --> 00:50:20,550
Sure.

1805
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:21,290
Him and Christ.

1806
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:21,471
Yeah,

1807
00:50:21,471 --> 00:50:23,110
I have those bears.

1808
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:24,340
They wouldn't be,

1809
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,060
you know,

1810
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,470
it wouldn't be obvious.

1811
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:26,960
No.

1812
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,410
Right.

1813
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:28,160
That's a delicious

1814
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:28,993
couple.

1815
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,620
Imagine they're great with another,

1816
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:32,540
they have sex or not to just so awesome.

1817
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:37,630
So what percentage do you think then
are complete like flaming the whole way

1818
00:50:38,511 --> 00:50:39,170
versus,

1819
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,030
I think that's never,

1820
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:40,873
you'd never know.

1821
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:41,870
That's PR.

1822
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:42,280
I Dunno.

1823
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,700
1.7% if it's 1.7 so let's round it off.

1824
00:50:45,701 --> 00:50:48,130
Let's say it's 2% that are in the closet,

1825
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:49,570
2% out of the closet.

1826
00:50:49,571 --> 00:50:50,980
4% of all Americans gay.

1827
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:51,940
We willing to say that.

1828
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:52,840
I'm willing to say that.

1829
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,673
I want to say that.

1830
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:54,371
I'll go.

1831
00:50:54,371 --> 00:50:54,570
Yeah,

1832
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:55,450
that's probably about right.

1833
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:57,670
So 4% of all Americans being gay.

1834
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,090
I'd say Super Gay dudes.

1835
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:02,230
It's like 1%

1836
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,170
and that's mostly drug pointed.

1837
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:07,110
The drug probably like just raging,

1838
00:51:07,111 --> 00:51:08,340
like I wanna fuck you in the ass.

1839
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,020
No Man.

1840
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:11,810
I have some friends that are a,

1841
00:51:11,811 --> 00:51:16,150
a gay couple that live in my neighborhood
and they're pretty obviously gay,

1842
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:20,940
but they're not like partiers or
animals or anything wacky then.

1843
00:51:20,941 --> 00:51:21,400
No,

1844
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,233
not doing,

1845
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,540
I don't think they're doing drugs.

1846
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:25,130
You know what's weird
about it to me is like,

1847
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:26,480
I know for myself,

1848
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:29,270
I don't really want to
be defined by anything.

1849
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,490
I don't want to be defined by one
thing about mice and you're queer.

1850
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:34,210
Queer is perfect.

1851
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:35,240
I'm going to fit.

1852
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,540
So I'm going to fit right
in the LBG and somebody can,

1853
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:41,540
like the last thing I want
is some kind of label,

1854
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,360
but in that world it seems
like that's exactly what,

1855
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,051
you know what I mean?

1856
00:51:45,051 --> 00:51:45,884
You want to be labeled.

1857
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:46,281
Yeah.

1858
00:51:46,281 --> 00:51:46,821
It's so,

1859
00:51:46,821 --> 00:51:47,511
it's so weird.

1860
00:51:47,511 --> 00:51:48,344
It's like,

1861
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:49,250
I don't know.

1862
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:50,950
I think because there's a lot,

1863
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:51,030
a lot

1864
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:51,571
of,

1865
00:51:51,571 --> 00:51:52,404
um,

1866
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:55,290
they want to be identified,

1867
00:51:55,291 --> 00:51:56,010
first of all,

1868
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:57,360
they're proud to be out,

1869
00:51:57,390 --> 00:52:01,440
like to be out is probably like
a huge relief off of your back.

1870
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:02,100
Right.

1871
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:02,700
It's just,

1872
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:03,061
you know,

1873
00:52:03,061 --> 00:52:06,030
just to be out and accept and not
have to hide that shit anymore.

1874
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:08,010
None of to have that
hovering over your head.

1875
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,410
I'd probably probably
really fucks with people.

1876
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:11,783
Um,

1877
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:16,350
so it's probably like an affirmation
and a lot of ways to just to say you're

1878
00:52:16,351 --> 00:52:17,130
gay,

1879
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:18,390
but the queer thing is,

1880
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,100
I think they don't want to be,

1881
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:21,780
I don't want to butcher this.

1882
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:23,253
My Queer friends,

1883
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:28,290
they don't want to be described as a
he or a she or a gay or a straight,

1884
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:29,820
they want to be that.

1885
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,290
There's those folks too.

1886
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:32,131
I mean,

1887
00:52:32,131 --> 00:52:32,521
otherwise,

1888
00:52:32,521 --> 00:52:33,360
why would it be queer?

1889
00:52:33,361 --> 00:52:34,470
Why wouldn't it be bisexual?

1890
00:52:34,471 --> 00:52:35,220
Like what are you,

1891
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,240
are you I'm queer.

1892
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:36,571
Okay.

1893
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:37,141
What does that mean?

1894
00:52:37,141 --> 00:52:37,771
Are you gay,

1895
00:52:37,771 --> 00:52:39,240
straight or bisexual?

1896
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:39,780
Hmm.

1897
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:40,190
I'm queer.

1898
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:41,023
Just queer.

1899
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:42,420
So you're just all right.

1900
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:43,650
I got it.

1901
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:44,490
I think I got it.

1902
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:45,660
I don't know if I have it.

1903
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:46,470
You know,

1904
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:47,580
it's so that's a real,

1905
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,630
that's a thing that's queer,

1906
00:52:48,631 --> 00:52:49,530
that's queer is,

1907
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:50,760
no one's ever told me that before.

1908
00:52:50,761 --> 00:52:51,110
You know,

1909
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:51,841
just fucking Canadians.

1910
00:52:51,841 --> 00:52:52,651
We keep shit from you.

1911
00:52:52,651 --> 00:52:52,861
Yeah,

1912
00:52:52,861 --> 00:52:53,410
I guess so.

1913
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:54,243
There's a lot of things we can,

1914
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,120
I'm sure if I investigated
I could figure it out.

1915
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,610
But baby we had,

1916
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,930
there's one hell of a
pride parade in Toronto.

1917
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,180
One hell of a pride because
it queer pride though.

1918
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:06,030
That's a fucking confusing parade because
if you're truly queer he wouldn't even

1919
00:53:06,031 --> 00:53:07,890
show up for it cause you
don't even identify with it,

1920
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:08,700
you know,

1921
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,830
identify with that group
that's running that parade.

1922
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:11,800
Wow.

1923
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:11,961
Yeah.

1924
00:53:11,961 --> 00:53:16,200
I think people for the longest time
have been suppressed and still are.

1925
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:20,190
But I think for the longest time they
didn't have an outlet where they can

1926
00:53:20,191 --> 00:53:24,870
identify with other people that have also
been suppressed in very similar ways.

1927
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,160
So whether it's being

1928
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,130
gay or whether it's being
transgender or whether it's being,

1929
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:32,070
they didn't have a community
before to support them.

1930
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,580
They just had scattered groups of people
all across the country with no way to

1931
00:53:35,581 --> 00:53:36,510
communicate with each other.

1932
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:36,930
Yeah.

1933
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:37,763
Now that you can,

1934
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,800
it's probably the time that we're in it.

1935
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:42,240
I don't think it will
be like that forever.

1936
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:43,590
At some point you mean?

1937
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:43,980
Well,

1938
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,200
at some point I feel like the,

1939
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:49,380
it won't be as exciting as
it is now to be a queer.

1940
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:55,560
Here's what I mean by that is since it's
only recently become as accepted as it

1941
00:53:55,561 --> 00:53:56,150
is now,

1942
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:56,301
right?

1943
00:53:56,301 --> 00:53:56,600
Right.

1944
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,510
50 years ago,

1945
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:01,410
I don't know what they were going to do
to somebody who came out or a hundred

1946
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:02,243
years ago or whatever.

1947
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:03,930
It was obviously a tougher time,

1948
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:08,700
so eventually it will be so commonplace
that it won't even drum up nearly the

1949
00:54:08,701 --> 00:54:09,930
discussion than it does now.

1950
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:10,291
Yeah,

1951
00:54:10,291 --> 00:54:12,980
but as long as it's only
4% of the population,

1952
00:54:12,981 --> 00:54:15,270
that's always going to
be a marginalized group.

1953
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:15,780
I mean,

1954
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:18,180
I guess so I can't go with you on that,

1955
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:21,090
but do you think it's always going
to be 4% is that something that's,

1956
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:23,910
is it something that is a
growing figure shrinking figure?

1957
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:25,140
That's where it becomes a real problem.

1958
00:54:25,141 --> 00:54:26,100
And the Christian community,

1959
00:54:26,101 --> 00:54:28,740
because that means a bunch of queers
or indoctrinate and all the young,

1960
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,173
that's what's going on.

1961
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:31,200
They're spreading their queer.

1962
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:31,860
Well,

1963
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:35,160
while there's a lot of people that
believe that if you sexually indoctrinate

1964
00:54:35,161 --> 00:54:36,780
someone to world of homosexuality,

1965
00:54:36,781 --> 00:54:37,710
very young in life,

1966
00:54:37,711 --> 00:54:40,240
that they'll identify with that impresses.

1967
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:41,820
It does a deep conversation,

1968
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:43,320
dude to deep conversation,

1969
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:45,300
but it has more to do.

1970
00:54:45,301 --> 00:54:46,410
What is it with the pedophile,

1971
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:47,620
pedophile stuff?

1972
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:49,110
I'm not saying pedophilia.

1973
00:54:49,111 --> 00:54:49,230
No,

1974
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:49,500
no,

1975
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:49,711
but,

1976
00:54:49,711 --> 00:54:50,010
right.

1977
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:55,010
But the likelihood of a person who was
molested by a pedophile turning into a

1978
00:54:55,321 --> 00:54:56,520
pedophile themselves.

1979
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:57,150
Yeah,

1980
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:58,440
I think that's documented.

1981
00:54:58,470 --> 00:54:59,490
That is documented.

1982
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,140
I don't,

1983
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:02,460
I don't know if those are totally related,

1984
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:03,420
you know?

1985
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:03,631
No,

1986
00:55:03,631 --> 00:55:07,590
just how young being young exp experiences
you have when you're young helped

1987
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,480
shape your perception of so many things.

1988
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:09,991
It does.

1989
00:55:09,991 --> 00:55:10,681
And also,

1990
00:55:10,681 --> 00:55:11,100
um,

1991
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:16,100
women who have been molested a young age
tend to lean more towards prostitution

1992
00:55:17,011 --> 00:55:21,420
and towards a pornography and towards
a lot of things along those lines that

1993
00:55:21,421 --> 00:55:23,910
their ideas about sexuality get morphed.

1994
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:25,410
But yeah,

1995
00:55:25,411 --> 00:55:25,731
it's,

1996
00:55:25,731 --> 00:55:26,491
it's interesting,

1997
00:55:26,491 --> 00:55:27,090
Matt.

1998
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:27,810
Um,

1999
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:28,201
the,

2000
00:55:28,201 --> 00:55:29,640
the 4% thing,

2001
00:55:29,641 --> 00:55:30,474
like you know what,

2002
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:31,090
that's,

2003
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:33,440
there's another question
like what makes someone gay?

2004
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:36,000
I mean how many people are
gay because of a choice.

2005
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,240
How many people would be like
fucking dealing with chicks?

2006
00:55:39,241 --> 00:55:39,841
I'm just going to learn,

2007
00:55:39,841 --> 00:55:40,950
start liking dude.

2008
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:42,110
How many of them,

2009
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:44,760
and I feel like the company line
is that people are born gay.

2010
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,520
But I always had difficulty with that.

2011
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:48,770
I mean I have,

2012
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,910
I have difficulty believing
people are born anything.

2013
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:53,070
Oh you need to meet this
kid that lives on my street.

2014
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:53,341
Like no,

2015
00:55:53,341 --> 00:55:53,580
but,

2016
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:56,010
but by this I mean by this I
mean that's some percentage,

2017
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:59,820
some percentage of our existences nature
in some percentage of our existence is

2018
00:55:59,821 --> 00:56:00,654
nurture.

2019
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:00,931
Right?

2020
00:56:00,931 --> 00:56:01,561
It's a mixture.

2021
00:56:01,561 --> 00:56:02,520
It's not any one,

2022
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:03,600
it's not concrete.

2023
00:56:03,601 --> 00:56:07,410
You don't come out with
a concrete perspective on
anything except this kid on my

2024
00:56:07,411 --> 00:56:07,920
street,

2025
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,900
he's five and he's gay as fuck,

2026
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,870
but five by five.

2027
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:17,940
I think we underestimate how quickly
characters built on an individual between

2028
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:20,640
the ages of one to two or two to three.

2029
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:23,130
We look at a five year
old and for us as adults,

2030
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:24,370
years is nothing.

2031
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:25,203
It's a blank,

2032
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:27,040
but for them it's so,

2033
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:27,820
yes.

2034
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:31,390
It's such a huge span in so much is
happening in that period of time.

2035
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:31,921
Oh yeah,

2036
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:36,000
and your childhood being traumatic
is incredibly hard to get over.

2037
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,190
It's just the fact that
it happened 15 years ago.

2038
00:56:38,191 --> 00:56:40,720
It's set the boundaries and the framework,

2039
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:44,670
sort of the building blocks of your
personality and to kind of go back and

2040
00:56:44,671 --> 00:56:45,690
repair that shit.

2041
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:48,750
Very difficult to do two
people know or do some people,

2042
00:56:48,751 --> 00:56:50,450
most people I think never do,

2043
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:54,420
but as opposed to someone who's
born and raised in a really,

2044
00:56:54,421 --> 00:56:57,510
like I have friends that grew
up fucked up and they're just,

2045
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:02,660
there's something about the fucked up at
that they encountered that just they're

2046
00:57:02,671 --> 00:57:03,061
gone.

2047
00:57:03,061 --> 00:57:04,770
They're never going to
come all the way back.

2048
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,620
They never got to look at themselves
objectively than ever going to step back

2049
00:57:07,621 --> 00:57:12,621
and try to fix many or any
of the personality issues
they might have developed

2050
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:15,060
because of like a protective mechanism.

2051
00:57:15,061 --> 00:57:16,530
They sort of developed as a young person.

2052
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,490
There's not going to do it.

2053
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:18,301
I shut off button.

2054
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:18,480
Yeah,

2055
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,150
there's just a,

2056
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:20,130
whatever it is,

2057
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:20,370
they're,

2058
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:20,730
they're,

2059
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:21,480
they're done,

2060
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,313
they're done growing,

2061
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:26,190
changing and then other people like
you meet them in their consistently

2062
00:57:26,191 --> 00:57:30,610
exploring their personality and their
life and improving upon themselves and

2063
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,190
doing new things.

2064
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:32,641
You know,

2065
00:57:32,641 --> 00:57:33,960
I love when I talked to someone like,

2066
00:57:33,961 --> 00:57:34,231
dude,

2067
00:57:34,231 --> 00:57:36,060
I took up scuba dive in like bots.

2068
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:37,320
That's awesome.

2069
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,400
Tell me about scuba diving.

2070
00:57:38,401 --> 00:57:39,540
You know like people,

2071
00:57:39,541 --> 00:57:43,800
I mean that's not the best example but
about someone who's like consistently and

2072
00:57:43,801 --> 00:57:45,570
constantly trying to expand,

2073
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:45,940
you know,

2074
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:46,171
their,

2075
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:49,650
their experiences and try
to and analyzing their life.

2076
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:54,300
Then there's other people that are just
in a sea of bad decision making and

2077
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:58,290
alcoholism and drug abuse and
gambling and this and that.

2078
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,121
It seems like,

2079
00:57:59,121 --> 00:57:59,990
it seems like it,

2080
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:00,680
it can,

2081
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,630
he can come out in so many different ways,

2082
00:58:02,631 --> 00:58:05,840
but it ultimately stems from
being happy or not being happy,

2083
00:58:05,841 --> 00:58:06,051
you know,

2084
00:58:06,051 --> 00:58:07,370
finding a way to get there.

2085
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:07,820
Right?

2086
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,260
It can mean shit can happen to you,

2087
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:13,370
and you have that moment of interpretation
where you can take it one way or take

2088
00:58:13,371 --> 00:58:14,930
it down down a different path,

2089
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:17,570
and the more severe the experience,

2090
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:21,380
the harder it is to take it
in a positive way as we were.

2091
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:21,951
That is,

2092
00:58:21,951 --> 00:58:22,784
I don't know.

2093
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:23,653
You know what I mean?

2094
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:25,370
Like for example,

2095
00:58:25,371 --> 00:58:26,030
failure,

2096
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:28,550
like that's the main way you
learn how to do something.

2097
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:31,580
So I'm going to learn how to ride a bike.

2098
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:32,420
Well,

2099
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:34,160
if I fall off that bike,

2100
00:58:34,161 --> 00:58:37,970
I'm going to learn really quickly to
stay focused so that that doesn't happen

2101
00:58:37,971 --> 00:58:39,470
because there's pain
on the other end of it.

2102
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:44,860
So here's this really negative thing
that actually acts as the mechanism for

2103
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:47,900
getting me from a to B and
getting better at something.

2104
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:52,400
But the pain portion on its
own when you can't justify it,

2105
00:58:52,401 --> 00:58:54,350
when you can't figure out the end message,

2106
00:58:54,351 --> 00:58:57,800
when you can't figure out what
I've learned because of this,

2107
00:58:57,801 --> 00:58:59,630
that's when it's the toughest to digest.

2108
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:00,921
Yeah.

2109
00:59:00,921 --> 00:59:04,520
I think there's a lot of folks that
tried to stay as comfortable as possible,

2110
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:05,960
as much as possible,

2111
00:59:05,961 --> 00:59:06,231
too.

2112
00:59:06,231 --> 00:59:07,730
So terrified of that pain,

2113
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:08,110
right.

2114
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:13,110
So instead they just don't experience
much like a very narrow world of,

2115
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:14,360
you know,

2116
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:17,570
and then maybe they'll experience like
a little bit of emotional pain online

2117
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:18,523
every now and again.

2118
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:19,603
You know what I mean?

2119
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:22,010
Like they'll put up a youtube
video then read the comments

2120
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:23,590
and that's,

2121
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:24,560
that's the enough,

2122
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:24,870
no,

2123
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:28,100
no bike riding for them because
that would be some real life pain.

2124
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:28,281
See,

2125
00:59:28,281 --> 00:59:28,671
I have,

2126
00:59:28,671 --> 00:59:29,780
I have two little kids.

2127
00:59:29,781 --> 00:59:31,460
I have a four year old and a two year old.

2128
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:36,350
And just like my life has changed a lot
since having them just didn't analyzing

2129
00:59:36,351 --> 00:59:37,410
their behavior and,

2130
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:40,250
and then analyzing my own in contrast to,

2131
00:59:40,251 --> 00:59:42,410
there's like again,

2132
00:59:42,411 --> 00:59:42,670
yeah.

2133
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:42,870
Uh,

2134
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:47,540
adults are constantly trying
to find ways to avoid pain,

2135
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,350
to avoid off,

2136
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:51,200
not feeling great all the time.

2137
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,150
Like we're complete,

2138
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:53,721
you know,

2139
00:59:53,721 --> 00:59:54,471
risk avoidance.

2140
00:59:54,471 --> 00:59:54,651
I mean,

2141
00:59:54,651 --> 00:59:55,550
the average person,

2142
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:55,851
whatever,

2143
00:59:55,851 --> 00:59:58,190
nine to five type individual them,

2144
00:59:58,310 --> 01:00:00,260
they put themselves out
there for no reason.

2145
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,220
My four year old,

2146
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,181
there's a swing set.

2147
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:05,900
He could go on the swing or he could
pick one of the posts going to to the top

2148
01:00:05,901 --> 01:00:07,520
and climb all the way to the top and sit.

2149
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:08,473
He's four.

2150
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:09,280
You know,

2151
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,240
like what is driving him to do that?

2152
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,250
Because the adult mind would say,

2153
01:00:13,251 --> 01:00:13,401
oh,

2154
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:16,130
you're going to break your
wrist or leg or whatever,

2155
01:00:16,131 --> 01:00:16,910
and he might,

2156
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:18,410
and someone's going to blame me for it.

2157
01:00:18,411 --> 01:00:19,244
Fine.

2158
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,400
But that it's the drive
portion in and of itself.

2159
01:00:22,401 --> 01:00:25,190
This just wanting to experiment,

2160
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:26,540
that's the most exciting.

2161
01:00:26,541 --> 01:00:28,760
That's the part that I want to tap into.

2162
01:00:28,761 --> 01:00:29,990
That's the part that's contagious.

2163
01:00:29,991 --> 01:00:31,190
You see him do that and it's like,

2164
01:00:31,191 --> 01:00:31,970
shit,

2165
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:32,480
why do I,

2166
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,620
why should I fall in line?

2167
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:35,300
Even if it's not directly related?

2168
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:38,420
Why does the next thing I do
need to be the status quo?

2169
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:39,980
Like what we did today,

2170
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:42,860
what we did today is not
your average tech video,

2171
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:43,780
right?

2172
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:44,030
Well,

2173
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:44,820
to tell people.

2174
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:45,653
Yeah.

2175
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,380
I was wondering if you were
going to talk about it for sure.

2176
01:00:48,381 --> 01:00:49,520
We've talked about
anything and everything.

2177
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:50,510
What we did today,

2178
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,250
we ran a little test.

2179
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,113
I'll experiment.

2180
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:54,380
Uh,

2181
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,220
do people know?

2182
01:00:55,370 --> 01:01:00,110
Most people know behind this studio
is an a little mini archery range.

2183
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:01,581
If you don't know that,

2184
01:01:01,581 --> 01:01:02,390
you shouldn't know that.

2185
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:04,790
There's a couple of pictures
on Joe's Instagram feed.

2186
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:05,900
That's how I knew about it.

2187
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:06,850
Uh,

2188
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:11,850
a little mini archery range
and the experiment involved
bringing some technology

2189
01:01:12,081 --> 01:01:17,081
components out here to figure out how
they would resist the impact of an Arrow,

2190
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:19,310
right?

2191
01:01:19,310 --> 01:01:19,610
Yes.

2192
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:20,420
Yes,

2193
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:20,980
yes.

2194
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:22,610
Have I done a good job so far?

2195
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:24,830
I feel like I'm dancing
around the subject.

2196
01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:25,850
Okay.

2197
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:26,840
The upcoming iPhone,

2198
01:01:26,841 --> 01:01:31,841
the iPhone six supposedly has a sapphire
display or a display that's partially

2199
01:01:32,571 --> 01:01:33,291
made of Sapphire.

2200
01:01:33,291 --> 01:01:34,340
Here's a problem with Sapphire.

2201
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,030
How Tech,

2202
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:36,070
how technical do you want to get up?

2203
01:01:36,071 --> 01:01:36,590
Get in there.

2204
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:37,423
Okay.

2205
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:39,920
Sapphires are really hard material.

2206
01:01:39,921 --> 01:01:41,840
They'd been using it on
watch faces for a long time.

2207
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:42,860
It doesn't scratch easily.

2208
01:01:42,861 --> 01:01:44,030
If you buy a Rolex or something,

2209
01:01:44,031 --> 01:01:46,220
it's probably got a sapphire
face or something like that,

2210
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,193
something like that.

2211
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:50,150
But it's really expensive
and it's really brittle.

2212
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:53,000
So for a flexible
surface it would be shit,

2213
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:54,230
shit shitty.

2214
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:57,260
And what a lot of people don't
realize is that even if you have a,

2215
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:58,281
a stiff phone,

2216
01:01:58,281 --> 01:01:59,114
like an iPhone,

2217
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:03,080
there's a certain amount of flex that
it can put up with without chipping or

2218
01:02:03,081 --> 01:02:04,490
shattering like something like this.

2219
01:02:04,491 --> 01:02:05,060
You know,

2220
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:06,110
you can put some force on it,

2221
01:02:06,111 --> 01:02:06,944
you could sit on it,

2222
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:07,491
et cetera.

2223
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:11,450
It doesn't crack when you bend over
type stuff or chip very easily,

2224
01:02:11,451 --> 01:02:12,980
although people crack them anyway,

2225
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:13,521
smash him.

2226
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:14,090
Anyways,

2227
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:16,550
so co companies came out with
things like gorilla glass,

2228
01:02:16,551 --> 01:02:21,551
which are these flexible kinds of glass
that are made out of a laminated Paulie

2229
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:22,770
type bullshit.

2230
01:02:22,771 --> 01:02:23,880
A little bit of everything in there,

2231
01:02:23,881 --> 01:02:24,714
some glass,

2232
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:25,800
some minerals,

2233
01:02:25,801 --> 01:02:26,634
some plastic.

2234
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:27,810
These new Sapphire one,

2235
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:30,990
which is supposed to be patented by apple
is supposed to be the strongest we've

2236
01:02:30,991 --> 01:02:31,824
ever seen.

2237
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:36,090
So fewer people are going to end up in
the apple store with a cracked iPhone.

2238
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:36,751
Essentially.

2239
01:02:36,751 --> 01:02:36,891
That's,

2240
01:02:36,891 --> 01:02:38,820
that's the way it's looking right now.

2241
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:40,860
So my Buddy Marquez,

2242
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:41,760
who we talked about earlier,

2243
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:47,190
God is hands on and through a very similar
source to who I've gotten my hands on

2244
01:02:47,191 --> 01:02:48,300
components from before.

2245
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:50,790
Got His hands on this glass.

2246
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:51,653
Supposedly,

2247
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:52,553
allegedly,

2248
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:53,220
whatever.

2249
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:53,490
No,

2250
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:53,880
no,

2251
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:54,301
no.

2252
01:02:54,301 --> 01:02:55,980
A definitiveness there.

2253
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:57,410
But what we think is the,

2254
01:02:57,411 --> 01:02:58,290
the upcoming glass,

2255
01:02:58,410 --> 01:02:59,410
put it through its paces,

2256
01:02:59,411 --> 01:03:00,420
it scratched it with a knife,

2257
01:03:00,421 --> 01:03:01,980
scratched it with keys,

2258
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:02,940
would not scratch,

2259
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:03,600
right.

2260
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,470
Very durable.

2261
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:06,330
But I met,

2262
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:08,250
I was unimpressed because I said,

2263
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:08,790
well,

2264
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:10,350
we need to bust the thing.

2265
01:03:10,351 --> 01:03:12,390
We can need to take the thing
to the point of destruction.

2266
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:13,290
This is not enough.

2267
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:14,490
And I wasn't the only one.

2268
01:03:14,491 --> 01:03:15,810
There were people in the
comments that were like,

2269
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:16,740
well dude,

2270
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:17,573
you,

2271
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:18,930
he did a great video.

2272
01:03:18,931 --> 01:03:19,530
So he,

2273
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:20,311
he doesn't deserve it.

2274
01:03:20,311 --> 01:03:20,731
But they were like,

2275
01:03:20,731 --> 01:03:21,510
well dude,

2276
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:22,920
sure you bent it and scratched it,

2277
01:03:22,921 --> 01:03:24,390
but at what point is it,

2278
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:25,650
is it going to be destroyed?

2279
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:27,173
And so,

2280
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:27,690
uh,

2281
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:28,710
we wanted to test that.

2282
01:03:28,711 --> 01:03:31,680
So I sent him a message where I said,

2283
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:32,251
listen,

2284
01:03:32,251 --> 01:03:32,551
me,

2285
01:03:32,551 --> 01:03:33,384
you,

2286
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:34,920
let's figure out how to get this done.

2287
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:35,641
I think,

2288
01:03:35,641 --> 01:03:35,880
uh,

2289
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,200
maybe we should go to a gun range.

2290
01:03:37,201 --> 01:03:38,340
That's what I said to him at first.

2291
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:39,121
I said,

2292
01:03:39,121 --> 01:03:39,210
yeah.

2293
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:39,511
I said,

2294
01:03:39,511 --> 01:03:39,720
yeah.

2295
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,021
He said,

2296
01:03:40,021 --> 01:03:40,500
on Dm,

2297
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:40,761
I said,

2298
01:03:40,761 --> 01:03:41,850
have you ever been to a gun range?

2299
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:42,481
He said,

2300
01:03:42,481 --> 01:03:43,410
I like where this is going.

2301
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:45,180
Then I responded with,

2302
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:46,590
I think I can do one better.

2303
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:47,790
I said,

2304
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:47,921
well,

2305
01:03:47,921 --> 01:03:48,930
you think about an arrow.

2306
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:49,830
He said,

2307
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:50,461
sold,

2308
01:03:50,461 --> 01:03:51,030
right?

2309
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:51,480
I said,

2310
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,370
let me reach out to
maybe reach out to Joe.

2311
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:55,560
So then I sent a message to Joe.

2312
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:56,490
Uh,

2313
01:03:56,490 --> 01:03:57,510
it was kind of vague.

2314
01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:59,010
I liked the way it was phrased though.

2315
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:00,091
I said,

2316
01:04:00,091 --> 01:04:04,710
leaked iPhone Sapphire screen
in Arrow in a high speed camera.

2317
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:05,941
That was it.

2318
01:04:05,941 --> 01:04:06,151
Dot,

2319
01:04:06,151 --> 01:04:06,331
dot.

2320
01:04:06,331 --> 01:04:06,940
Dot.

2321
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:07,773
What are you think about that?

2322
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,450
And he responded with,

2323
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:10,560
Fuck Yeah,

2324
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:11,940
you hear me folks?

2325
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:13,380
No hesitation.

2326
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:14,543
Fuck Ya.

2327
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:15,740
Right in the DM.

2328
01:04:15,950 --> 01:04:17,430
And that's what I love
about this guy right here.

2329
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:19,290
So we came down and we did it.

2330
01:04:19,291 --> 01:04:21,240
We made it happen in the
video is going to go live.

2331
01:04:21,241 --> 01:04:25,950
I have a shit ton of data to look through
because this camera's shooting at nine

2332
01:04:25,951 --> 01:04:27,090
60 fps,

2333
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:28,330
which we,

2334
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:30,360
I'm going to have the
calculation wrong here,

2335
01:04:30,361 --> 01:04:33,360
but essentially an eight second clip
is an enormous amount of footage.

2336
01:04:33,361 --> 01:04:36,270
It's like minutes worth
so over over a minute.

2337
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:39,330
960 frames per second.

2338
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:42,270
That's what we shot it
at the impact and 60.

2339
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:42,871
Yeah,

2340
01:04:42,871 --> 01:04:43,960
it turned out it was,

2341
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:47,640
it was like one minute of
video equals one second.

2342
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:48,533
Was that the,

2343
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:49,560
is that,

2344
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:50,070
is that it?

2345
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:50,903
I don't know.

2346
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:53,340
I don't want to go on record as,

2347
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:56,010
as cause I'm going to be
wrong if I do go on record,

2348
01:04:56,011 --> 01:04:58,110
but for those that are
really into this shit,

2349
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:03,111
we were shooting on a an fs 700 at the
highest frame rate possible and uh,

2350
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:06,510
and basically we're going to try
and give you guys the most accurate

2351
01:05:06,511 --> 01:05:08,400
representation of the impact that we can.

2352
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:09,780
And uh,

2353
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,670
I mean I'm not going to spill it here.

2354
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:14,940
We got to leave a little reason
to go check out the video,

2355
01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:16,163
but uh,

2356
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,130
interesting results.

2357
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,340
Yes,

2358
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:19,390
we're not going to spill it,

2359
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,070
but guess who wins?

2360
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:24,220
We did some other stuff too.

2361
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:25,143
Not The phone.

2362
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:27,070
We didn't stop at the,

2363
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:27,881
at the Sapphire,

2364
01:05:27,881 --> 01:05:28,840
the upcoming Sapphire.

2365
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:29,170
We have what?

2366
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:30,340
We had more fun than that.

2367
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:34,390
So plenty of incentive to
head over to unbox therapy.

2368
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:36,100
Hit the subscribe button right now.

2369
01:05:36,101 --> 01:05:39,430
So you're ready when the video goes live
because we're about to take over the

2370
01:05:39,431 --> 01:05:41,710
Internet and we're counting on
you guys to help us get there.

2371
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:41,950
Oh,

2372
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:42,970
we'll definitely promote it.

2373
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,620
We shot some shit.

2374
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:46,300
We shot at quite a bunch of shit.

2375
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:46,690
Yeah,

2376
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:47,200
definitely.

2377
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:47,531
It was,

2378
01:05:47,531 --> 01:05:48,070
uh,

2379
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:48,880
it was worth doing.

2380
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,020
Definitely for sure.

2381
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:50,530
Yeah.

2382
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:51,281
So yeah,

2383
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:52,650
we brought in a lot of cool people down.

2384
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:53,800
I should shout everybody out.

2385
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:54,881
We brought,

2386
01:05:54,881 --> 01:05:55,580
uh,

2387
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:55,750
uh,

2388
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:56,590
Austin Evans.

2389
01:05:56,591 --> 01:05:59,110
We brought John from TLD we brought,

2390
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:00,640
mark has of course.

2391
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,050
Who else am I missing right now?

2392
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:03,310
I don't think anybody,

2393
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:04,263
no,

2394
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:05,980
I probably am been being
an answer right now.

2395
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:06,760
Uh,

2396
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:09,070
Josh also from TLD was there

2397
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:11,440
anyway.

2398
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:11,990
Anyway,

2399
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:14,050
we made it happens and a
bunch of quick cool people.

2400
01:06:14,051 --> 01:06:16,420
Way Too many cameras
were in the back there.

2401
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:17,320
You're going to see it all.

2402
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:18,790
We got behind the scenes.

2403
01:06:18,791 --> 01:06:20,380
We got in front of the scenes.

2404
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:22,630
This is destruction at its best.

2405
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:23,500
It was awesome.

2406
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:24,603
It went down.

2407
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:26,733
Go watch a video.

2408
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:27,560
What,

2409
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,550
what is it about men that uh,

2410
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:30,670
we were talking about this,

2411
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:30,990
right?

2412
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:33,460
Like men wanting to shoot
things and blow them up.

2413
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:36,340
Like if you had to
compare like the numbers,

2414
01:06:36,341 --> 01:06:37,250
just the sheer numbers.

2415
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:38,440
Forget about how many people are gay.

2416
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,620
The sheer number of things of
things that go blown out by men.

2417
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:42,760
You know,

2418
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,240
like what does my holes,

2419
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:46,053
yeah.

2420
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:47,920
No checks to stick and
firecrackers up there.

2421
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,110
But I think things that get like,

2422
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:52,240
like blown up in a field,

2423
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:55,870
how many things get blown up in
the field that are growing up?

2424
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:57,070
I used to fish,

2425
01:06:57,490 --> 01:07:01,650
he used to put firecrackers in their
mouth and just blow them up after fishing.

2426
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:03,023
That's so rude.

2427
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:03,581
You should be,

2428
01:07:03,581 --> 01:07:05,670
you should be on some
watch list somewhere.

2429
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,250
You know that you weren't before.

2430
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:08,763
You are now.

2431
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:09,360
Yeah.

2432
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:09,890
Um,

2433
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:11,260
then like,

2434
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:14,470
like how many different like refrigerators
have been like stuffed full of

2435
01:07:14,471 --> 01:07:15,304
dynamite.

2436
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:16,290
It's all men.

2437
01:07:16,290 --> 01:07:16,870
Right.

2438
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:19,930
When I was a kid I had an obsession
with like opening stuff like this up.

2439
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:24,250
They would by my parents would buy me
some awesome piece of technology and I

2440
01:07:24,251 --> 01:07:29,020
would want to get inside of it
like keyboards and Walkmans.

2441
01:07:29,021 --> 01:07:30,760
I used to open those up wow.

2442
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:32,290
To just see what they were made of.

2443
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,300
I don't know if this is
an extension of that,

2444
01:07:34,301 --> 01:07:37,240
but ultimately you get to see
what the thing is made of.

2445
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:38,163
You know what I mean?

2446
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:42,430
That's part of it I think
for sure to see inside.

2447
01:07:42,431 --> 01:07:43,360
Once you shoot it,

2448
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:44,253
look inside,

2449
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:45,820
but blowing things up.

2450
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,080
It's also just to just blow things up.

2451
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:48,521
You're right,

2452
01:07:48,521 --> 01:07:48,910
you're right.

2453
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:49,930
I'm stretching on that.

2454
01:07:49,931 --> 01:07:52,450
I was trying to put a student
on the two different desires,

2455
01:07:52,451 --> 01:07:56,050
like your desire is like the desire
to see the wiring under the board,

2456
01:07:56,370 --> 01:07:58,450
which all real when the also,

2457
01:07:58,451 --> 01:07:59,380
when the Arrow hits it,

2458
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:02,380
like we're so used to seeing
this in the context of Ooh,

2459
01:08:02,381 --> 01:08:03,214
don't drop it.

2460
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:07,810
Don't spill on it to see it
in that light where fuck you.

2461
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,370
You know this thing,

2462
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:09,820
right,

2463
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:12,820
that you've been so
concerned about for so long,

2464
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:13,601
you know,

2465
01:08:13,601 --> 01:08:14,560
yet gentle with it.

2466
01:08:14,561 --> 01:08:14,990
You Bait,

2467
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:16,220
we fucking baby

2468
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:17,053
these things.

2469
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:17,690
True.

2470
01:08:17,690 --> 01:08:18,021
You know?

2471
01:08:18,021 --> 01:08:19,070
And so to take the,

2472
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:21,410
to take this thing that's on
your conscience all the time.

2473
01:08:21,411 --> 01:08:21,861
Where is it?

2474
01:08:21,861 --> 01:08:22,970
Do I have it is in my pocket,

2475
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:23,480
right?

2476
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:24,620
Who doesn't do the slap?

2477
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:25,723
The slap,

2478
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:26,340
slap.

2479
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:28,190
Did Wallet Phone.

2480
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:30,260
You don't leave that
premises until it's in there.

2481
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:31,461
So to say,

2482
01:08:31,461 --> 01:08:32,030
fuck it.

2483
01:08:32,030 --> 01:08:32,863
Even for a minute,

2484
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:33,860
even for a second,

2485
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:34,723
that's a win.

2486
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:40,250
Or you're just destroying getting
off on the fact you destroy things.

2487
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:41,713
But if it was,

2488
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:42,800
I mean it was cool,

2489
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:43,191
but like,

2490
01:08:43,191 --> 01:08:44,840
let's say we put some,

2491
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:45,561
I don't know,

2492
01:08:45,561 --> 01:08:47,870
a fucking banana there wouldn't
have been quite the same.

2493
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:48,900
Yeah,

2494
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:49,171
no,

2495
01:08:49,171 --> 01:08:51,600
definitely more valuable
things are cool to see.

2496
01:08:51,601 --> 01:08:52,800
Explode for whatever.

2497
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:56,370
Yeah,

2498
01:08:56,370 --> 01:08:57,031
I guess.

2499
01:08:57,031 --> 01:08:57,480
Yeah.

2500
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:58,230
Um,

2501
01:08:58,230 --> 01:08:58,980
what was I gonna say?

2502
01:08:58,980 --> 01:08:59,131
Oh,

2503
01:08:59,131 --> 01:09:00,270
exploding things.

2504
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:00,870
I don't know.

2505
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:01,703
Whenever I lost it,

2506
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:03,150
I lost whatever it was.

2507
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,030
It's exciting.

2508
01:09:05,031 --> 01:09:05,300
I mean,

2509
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:05,931
there's also this,

2510
01:09:05,931 --> 01:09:08,990
just from a very straight
up primal perspective,

2511
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:12,230
this idea of the impending doom.

2512
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:13,551
As a viewer,

2513
01:09:13,551 --> 01:09:14,360
you get to wait,

2514
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:15,350
you get to watch,

2515
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:16,610
but you know the outcome.

2516
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:18,560
You already know what the
fuck's going to happen,

2517
01:09:18,561 --> 01:09:20,090
but you need to see it happen anyways.

2518
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:21,343
I know what I was going to say.

2519
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:22,430
BLENDTEC blenders.

2520
01:09:22,431 --> 01:09:24,310
You ever seen that with a plan?

2521
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,311
With a band?

2522
01:09:25,311 --> 01:09:26,144
It's crazy.

2523
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:27,770
They blend the fucking iPhone.

2524
01:09:27,771 --> 01:09:28,700
They blend a shout.

2525
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:30,080
I've got dude blends.

2526
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:31,900
My Vitamix couldn't take.

2527
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:35,510
I have a Vitamix and I blend tech
and it couldn't do a pineapple.

2528
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:36,291
I cut up,

2529
01:09:36,291 --> 01:09:36,681
pop it up,

2530
01:09:36,681 --> 01:09:37,514
pineapple in there.

2531
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:38,613
It just overheat.

2532
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:39,980
Kept on overheating.

2533
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:43,160
But luckily there's a sensor in there
that you just have to unplug it and wait

2534
01:09:43,161 --> 01:09:44,360
30 minutes and shit.

2535
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,021
But I'm like,

2536
01:09:45,021 --> 01:09:45,561
wait a second,

2537
01:09:45,561 --> 01:09:47,750
why can't this shit do a pineapple?

2538
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:50,510
But like he got to man
up and get the tech man.

2539
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:51,260
Yeah.

2540
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:51,680
I Dunno.

2541
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,000
I enjoyed the Vitamix.

2542
01:09:53,001 --> 01:09:54,140
You know what I like about the Vitamix,

2543
01:09:54,141 --> 01:09:55,070
that plunger thing?

2544
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:55,371
Yeah.

2545
01:09:55,371 --> 01:09:56,690
The plunger think is nice,

2546
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:58,880
but I never used it for
anything other than Kale shakes.

2547
01:09:58,910 --> 01:09:59,540
Right.

2548
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:00,140
But uh,

2549
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:01,130
it's perfect for Kale.

2550
01:10:01,131 --> 01:10:01,964
Shakes works great,

2551
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:05,740
but the blend techs better even for Kale
shakes cause it really liquefies it,

2552
01:10:05,741 --> 01:10:08,090
it brings it down to like a much smaller,

2553
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:10,930
smaller size particle does it?

2554
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:14,420
I used my Blendtec though every
day or my Vitamix everyday.

2555
01:10:14,421 --> 01:10:15,770
Like even if I'm just getting like,

2556
01:10:15,771 --> 01:10:15,981
Hey,

2557
01:10:15,981 --> 01:10:17,000
I'm gonna get some apple juice,

2558
01:10:17,001 --> 01:10:19,770
I'll put some apple juice and ice
in it and make it like a frozen I,

2559
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:20,660
it's good man.

2560
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:21,790
It's good.

2561
01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:22,200
I mean you,

2562
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:26,470
you should look if the more you could
give your digestive system a break,

2563
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:27,850
blend shit up like that.

2564
01:10:28,030 --> 01:10:28,870
Like vegetables.

2565
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:30,133
It's good for you.

2566
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:30,851
It's good.

2567
01:10:30,851 --> 01:10:31,830
It helps you poop too.

2568
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,033
Could Lord,

2569
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:35,230
that's the best thing
about those Kale shakes.

2570
01:10:35,410 --> 01:10:36,880
The poops are fantastic.

2571
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:37,940
I need help there,

2572
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:38,773
man.

2573
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:40,290
I guess I got to jump on a killed train.

2574
01:10:40,291 --> 01:10:41,950
Still Wild Log ride.

2575
01:10:41,951 --> 01:10:42,220
Like,

2576
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:46,250
like you're working on the Yukon
and there's a river and then the,

2577
01:10:46,251 --> 01:10:49,810
the logs broke loose and
they went down current leg.

2578
01:10:49,930 --> 01:10:50,890
Ah,

2579
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,600
that's is like when you take a shit,

2580
01:10:52,601 --> 01:10:53,081
it's just like,

2581
01:10:53,081 --> 01:10:53,740
Whoa,

2582
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:54,573
hang on.

2583
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:55,900
Just hang on.

2584
01:10:55,901 --> 01:10:56,590
Perfect.

2585
01:10:56,590 --> 01:10:57,730
Whew.

2586
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,230
And then you'd be thinking like,

2587
01:10:59,231 --> 01:11:00,910
why hasn't my shit always like this?

2588
01:11:00,911 --> 01:11:01,750
Sometimes you know,

2589
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:03,010
you're going to think I gotta take a shit.

2590
01:11:03,011 --> 01:11:03,880
I definitely have to take a shit.

2591
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:04,571
All right,

2592
01:11:04,571 --> 01:11:06,000
let me just sit here and
wait for this to come out.

2593
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:07,660
How long should it shit?

2594
01:11:07,690 --> 01:11:08,980
How long should you be in there for?

2595
01:11:09,130 --> 01:11:10,420
How long should it be sitting down for?

2596
01:11:10,810 --> 01:11:13,000
It's really truly dependent on your diet,

2597
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:13,860
right?

2598
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:14,693
I think

2599
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:17,200
the easier it is for you to shit for you,

2600
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:19,830
for Joe Rogan and
experiencing in the bathroom.

2601
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,930
What's the perfect length of time?

2602
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:25,170
It depends on if I have my phone with
me cause sometimes I'll drag it out.

2603
01:11:25,190 --> 01:11:26,100
Even when I'm done,

2604
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:28,980
we're good magazine or
a book that I'm into,

2605
01:11:28,981 --> 01:11:31,580
I'll drag it out like I'm
done shitting finished.

2606
01:11:31,790 --> 01:11:32,191
What is,

2607
01:11:32,191 --> 01:11:33,360
don't feel like pulling my pants up.

2608
01:11:33,361 --> 01:11:36,930
What kind of have you said or what's
your record for time after you've been

2609
01:11:36,931 --> 01:11:38,910
finished for still
chilling with the phone.

2610
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:40,470
My legs go numb all the time.

2611
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:41,723
Tell you that

2612
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:47,310
especially when you got the iPhone are
aren't used to have a joke about it.

2613
01:11:47,311 --> 01:11:48,150
So true.

2614
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:48,601
You know,

2615
01:11:48,601 --> 01:11:53,601
you get that iPhone resting on your
elbows and your thighs and you're leaning

2616
01:11:53,761 --> 01:11:57,360
forward and you're just cutting off
all that out your legs essentially.

2617
01:11:57,690 --> 01:11:58,260
Yeah.

2618
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:00,210
Have you ever masturbated on the toilet?

2619
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:01,830
It's sitting on,

2620
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:02,790
that's not shading,

2621
01:12:02,791 --> 01:12:04,240
but just sitting on the toilet now

2622
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,120
like I had when the girl was over and
I couldn't masturbate in front of her.

2623
01:12:09,121 --> 01:12:10,050
So I would go to the bathroom.

2624
01:12:10,051 --> 01:12:12,450
Like I might take a shower and then you
just try to masturbate while sitting on

2625
01:12:12,451 --> 01:12:12,871
the toilet.

2626
01:12:12,871 --> 01:12:13,920
Why don't you just have sex with her?

2627
01:12:13,921 --> 01:12:14,754
She's right there.

2628
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:16,153
Weren't into it.

2629
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:16,831
Too much work.

2630
01:12:16,831 --> 01:12:17,610
Too much work.

2631
01:12:17,610 --> 01:12:18,210
Too much work.

2632
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:18,901
So what happened?

2633
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:19,061
What?

2634
01:12:19,061 --> 01:12:19,331
What was it?

2635
01:12:19,331 --> 01:12:19,821
What was the oak?

2636
01:12:19,821 --> 01:12:20,401
It's really hard.

2637
01:12:20,401 --> 01:12:21,480
Like I've only done it once.

2638
01:12:21,481 --> 01:12:22,680
I've tried like three times.

2639
01:12:23,290 --> 01:12:25,050
Know it's something about
the sitting on the toilet.

2640
01:12:25,051 --> 01:12:25,884
It's not.

2641
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,030
It takes you out of position.

2642
01:12:27,031 --> 01:12:28,740
I remember somebody sending me something,

2643
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:29,641
not a product.

2644
01:12:29,641 --> 01:12:32,790
They want it to send me a product because
they say we don't sit on the toilet

2645
01:12:32,791 --> 01:12:35,760
properly and it's distinct
to adjust the way you sit.

2646
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,290
Oh thing.

2647
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:38,520
That's what it was.

2648
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:40,240
Platforms squat what it was.

2649
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:41,521
Imagine that.

2650
01:12:41,521 --> 01:12:42,354
Review.

2651
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:43,320
My God.

2652
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:43,980
Yeah.

2653
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:46,220
That's supposedly the the way
you're supposed to have shit.

2654
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:46,740
I did.

2655
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:47,491
I looked it up.

2656
01:12:47,491 --> 01:12:48,810
I went to their website and I was like,

2657
01:12:48,811 --> 01:12:49,740
Holy Shit.

2658
01:12:49,741 --> 01:12:51,180
Everyone's shitting the wrong way.

2659
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:52,140
Yeah,

2660
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:52,621
we are.

2661
01:12:52,621 --> 01:12:53,454
That is true.

2662
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:57,660
It is easier for your
bowels to work if you're,

2663
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:01,780
if it like you can also sort of
adjust your posture when you're over.

2664
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:02,633
It's overtop.

2665
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:02,851
Yeah,

2666
01:13:02,851 --> 01:13:06,060
cause I think it's probably the way I'm
doing it with my phone while I'm leaning

2667
01:13:06,061 --> 01:13:08,310
forward and I'm saying this
is probably the worst worst.

2668
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:08,790
Like yeah,

2669
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:13,790
we should do probably go straighten
up and like mimic the squatting.

2670
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:17,100
The perfect technique with Joe Rogan.

2671
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:17,161
Yeah.

2672
01:13:17,161 --> 01:13:17,994
This is how you shit.

2673
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:19,210
Yeah.

2674
01:13:19,210 --> 01:13:20,580
Your mom never taught you this?

2675
01:13:20,581 --> 01:13:21,414
I'm here for you.

2676
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:22,021
Yeah.

2677
01:13:22,021 --> 01:13:25,440
I think like a squatting sort of
a thing like that like with a,

2678
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:27,720
with a straight back and
it'd be the way to do it.

2679
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:32,180
We got to fix the morning pee Boehner
problem because that shit like I still

2680
01:13:32,270 --> 01:13:33,740
like I'm not good at it.

2681
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:34,130
What's that?

2682
01:13:34,130 --> 01:13:34,720
What do you mean?

2683
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:38,450
Like where you have to like do that weird
position to stand over the toilet and

2684
01:13:38,451 --> 01:13:43,451
puts your boner down just to pee and oh
well you just got to just go outside.

2685
01:13:44,150 --> 01:13:46,130
Is that what you do see outside?

2686
01:13:46,131 --> 01:13:46,521
Really?

2687
01:13:46,521 --> 01:13:47,270
That's what you do.

2688
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:50,000
Get close to get one one
with you have a piss pot.

2689
01:13:50,001 --> 01:13:50,650
Have we talked about this?

2690
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:51,870
I I have a pissed pie.

2691
01:13:52,690 --> 01:13:52,880
No,

2692
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:53,511
it's outside.

2693
01:13:53,511 --> 01:13:54,890
I like to pee outside for some reason.

2694
01:13:54,891 --> 01:13:56,170
It's just more comforting and he's like,

2695
01:13:56,171 --> 01:13:58,840
I'll just walk outside and
pee and animal in the pot.

2696
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:00,650
The pot out there.

2697
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:03,040
It's a pot that's like
a planted pot books,

2698
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:06,350
little fertilizer for the plants.

2699
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:07,370
It's not good for it.

2700
01:14:07,371 --> 01:14:07,850
No,

2701
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:08,570
not at all.

2702
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:10,070
Dog piss kills lawns.

2703
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:10,760
I know that.

2704
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:12,080
Definitely yellow based

2705
01:14:12,110 --> 01:14:12,943
disaster.

2706
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:13,690
Yeah,

2707
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:14,190
like the,

2708
01:14:14,190 --> 01:14:16,490
it stops being green and I don't
know what's in a dog's pice.

2709
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:19,990
It's that Monya but it doesn't
seem to be the same as a human.

2710
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:21,580
Like when you pee on the grass,

2711
01:14:21,610 --> 01:14:22,720
like if you pee on your grass,

2712
01:14:22,721 --> 01:14:24,070
it doesn't seem to kill the grass.

2713
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:25,630
Dog Tastes the same

2714
01:14:29,430 --> 01:14:29,800
now.

2715
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:30,820
But you could smell dog pee.

2716
01:14:30,821 --> 01:14:34,520
It smells like regular P.

2717
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:35,353
Kathy's disgust.

2718
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:37,340
I don't know what you're into man.

2719
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:38,530
But dirty little animals.

2720
01:14:39,190 --> 01:14:39,790
My cat,

2721
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:40,623
my oldest cat,

2722
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:40,901
oh,

2723
01:14:40,901 --> 01:14:41,580
she's problems.

2724
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:43,450
She shits in front of the toilet now.

2725
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:44,530
She's old as fuck.

2726
01:14:44,531 --> 01:14:49,531
She's 18 right in front of my toilet
and it's like great shit or something.

2727
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:50,433
They'd mess.

2728
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,510
They're getting old when they get old man,

2729
01:14:52,511 --> 01:14:53,500
cat fall apart.

2730
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:54,380
I mean the,

2731
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:55,810
the hang in there for a long time.

2732
01:14:55,811 --> 01:14:56,351
Like my cats,

2733
01:14:56,351 --> 01:14:58,060
18 fucking years old.

2734
01:14:58,420 --> 01:14:59,141
She's hanging in there,

2735
01:14:59,141 --> 01:14:59,974
but every night,

2736
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:04,960
well she doesn't know what's going on.

2737
01:15:04,990 --> 01:15:05,860
She's 18,

2738
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:09,490
she's probably got some sort
of a neurological issue.

2739
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:12,730
Some Alzheimer's can get
Alzheimer's or something like that,

2740
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:13,930
but she'll,

2741
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:15,830
she just a racist as fuck shit up,

2742
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:18,400
screaming in words that night.

2743
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:20,230
I don't even know if she can,

2744
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:21,093
um,

2745
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:24,700
she remembers where the litter boxes
or she's to litter boxes in the house,

2746
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:28,060
but sometimes she's in the bathroom and
she'll just shit in the wrong bathroom

2747
01:15:28,061 --> 01:15:28,894
on the floor.

2748
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:30,880
This is all new like over the,

2749
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:32,270
that and thoughts.

2750
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,750
Also having problems jumping
on little counters like,

2751
01:15:34,751 --> 01:15:35,051
you know,

2752
01:15:35,051 --> 01:15:36,670
it's just like falls all the time.

2753
01:15:36,671 --> 01:15:38,950
And I think she's starting
to get blind or something.

2754
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,360
They just get week two.

2755
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:43,330
So at what point tomorrow?

2756
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:44,313
Bullets?

2757
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:45,383
No,

2758
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:46,670
we got a letter.

2759
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:47,980
I don't want her to suffer,

2760
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:48,221
you know,

2761
01:15:48,221 --> 01:15:50,560
if I thought she was suffering
like most of the time she's cool.

2762
01:15:50,561 --> 01:15:51,270
She's,

2763
01:15:51,270 --> 01:15:52,960
she has a problem shitting and you know,

2764
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:55,810
chickpeas in the wrong spots
and putting an animal down.

2765
01:15:55,910 --> 01:15:57,100
I put my dog down.

2766
01:15:57,130 --> 01:15:57,311
Well,

2767
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:57,461
I mean,

2768
01:15:57,461 --> 01:15:58,660
I didn't put it down.

2769
01:15:59,090 --> 01:15:59,870
You've been there.

2770
01:15:59,870 --> 01:16:00,101
Yeah,

2771
01:16:00,101 --> 01:16:00,391
yeah,

2772
01:16:00,391 --> 01:16:00,640
yeah.

2773
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:01,300
It's horrible.

2774
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:02,020
It's weird.

2775
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:02,620
It's hard.

2776
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:03,190
It's hard.

2777
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:03,970
It's hard.

2778
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:05,050
It's weird because you know,

2779
01:16:05,051 --> 01:16:06,190
you don't do that to people.

2780
01:16:06,430 --> 01:16:06,791
Well,

2781
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:07,624
you know,

2782
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:08,900
euthanasia,

2783
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:09,310
some peace.

2784
01:16:09,310 --> 01:16:11,170
Some people say it's more humane.

2785
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:11,381
Well,

2786
01:16:11,381 --> 01:16:12,220
it is more humane.

2787
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:12,580
Yeah.

2788
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:16,450
It's certainly more humane if you knew
that someone that you love dearly was

2789
01:16:16,451 --> 01:16:20,800
suffering in some horrible way and they
would probably stay alive for months or

2790
01:16:20,801 --> 01:16:23,530
maybe even a year in
this state before they,

2791
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:26,890
their body eventually gave out mean
there's no hope to bring them back.

2792
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:29,500
The problem is there's so many
people that would kill their parents.

2793
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:31,450
There's so many people
that would kill loved ones,

2794
01:16:31,451 --> 01:16:35,080
kill him if they had the
choice like people have had.

2795
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:40,770
There's been situations where a husband
or a wife had been critical and critical

2796
01:16:40,841 --> 01:16:43,330
condition and the wife had
been arguing to pull the plug,

2797
01:16:43,331 --> 01:16:46,960
or the husband had been arguing to pull
the plug and the massive controversy,

2798
01:16:46,961 --> 01:16:48,250
the family gets involved.

2799
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:49,270
Everybody's angry,

2800
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:49,481
you know,

2801
01:16:49,481 --> 01:16:50,860
so it's,

2802
01:16:50,890 --> 01:16:52,180
you can't just do that,

2803
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:52,590
you know,

2804
01:16:52,590 --> 01:16:52,731
it's,

2805
01:16:52,731 --> 01:16:52,910
it's,

2806
01:16:52,910 --> 01:16:54,610
it's what about the person themselves?

2807
01:16:54,611 --> 01:16:55,301
Making a call,

2808
01:16:55,301 --> 01:16:56,620
like if they're still cognizant,

2809
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,330
how can you tell they're cognizant.

2810
01:16:58,331 --> 01:16:59,230
They want to kill themselves.

2811
01:16:59,231 --> 01:17:01,600
I mean it's like suicides illegal,

2812
01:17:01,630 --> 01:17:02,440
which is hilarious.

2813
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:03,250
Not Everywhere.

2814
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:04,083
No,

2815
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:05,260
the other countries you mean?

2816
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:05,600
Yeah.

2817
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:06,433
Yeah.

2818
01:17:06,450 --> 01:17:06,820
Um,

2819
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:07,690
but in America,

2820
01:17:07,691 --> 01:17:09,250
essentially it's illegal everywhere.

2821
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:09,531
Right?

2822
01:17:09,531 --> 01:17:09,801
You know,

2823
01:17:09,801 --> 01:17:11,600
euthanasia as illegal.

2824
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:14,870
The Kevorkian guy who will see I person,

2825
01:17:14,871 --> 01:17:15,920
I don't have a problem with it.

2826
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:16,813
If a person,

2827
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:20,730
if a person could pass a psychological
evaluation that they're cognizant,

2828
01:17:20,731 --> 01:17:23,540
we their basic psychological
evaluation and they say,

2829
01:17:23,541 --> 01:17:23,811
listen,

2830
01:17:23,811 --> 01:17:25,220
I'm sick of suffering or whatever,

2831
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:26,990
but there needs to be suicide house.

2832
01:17:26,991 --> 01:17:27,351
So it was like,

2833
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:27,680
you know,

2834
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:32,680
they can go in and just like a big hole
in the ground falling or something like,

2835
01:17:33,530 --> 01:17:35,010
like there should be a
witness there should.

2836
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:35,210
Well,

2837
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:37,220
how about that suicide forest in Japan?

2838
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:38,173
Yeah.

2839
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:38,601
Yeah.

2840
01:17:38,601 --> 01:17:39,434
That's weird.

2841
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:43,130
The way people choose to do it through
the choose to do it with as little pain

2842
01:17:43,131 --> 01:17:43,641
as possible.

2843
01:17:43,641 --> 01:17:45,680
Very few people jump into volcanoes.

2844
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:46,461
You know?

2845
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:47,780
How many of you have bad ass way to go?

2846
01:17:47,781 --> 01:17:48,614
Right.

2847
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:50,850
How long would that take me?

2848
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:51,530
Be Instant.

2849
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:51,821
Yeah.

2850
01:17:51,821 --> 01:17:52,654
He went head first.

2851
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:53,180
Instant.

2852
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:53,750
I think so.

2853
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:53,991
Yeah.

2854
01:17:53,991 --> 01:17:55,740
You pay basically they would
just burst in the flying.

2855
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:56,583
Yeah.

2856
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:58,520
I mean that's what they used to do.

2857
01:17:58,521 --> 01:17:59,030
Right.

2858
01:17:59,030 --> 01:17:59,661
To bad people.

2859
01:17:59,661 --> 01:18:00,830
And you'd throw them in the volcanoes,

2860
01:18:01,730 --> 01:18:02,563
didn't they do that?

2861
01:18:02,810 --> 01:18:04,530
And I don't know why day,

2862
01:18:04,570 --> 01:18:05,150
never heard about,

2863
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:06,020
I'm sure it's happening.

2864
01:18:06,021 --> 01:18:06,854
Come on man.

2865
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,730
They used to sacrifice sent
to that volcano gods it.

2866
01:18:09,731 --> 01:18:11,060
But I don't know if that's
a real thing or not.

2867
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:12,140
We'll sacrifice.

2868
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:13,340
Certainly a real thing.

2869
01:18:13,341 --> 01:18:18,341
So you to assume sacrifice bubble Kanal
would be like the most about cool way to

2870
01:18:18,591 --> 01:18:19,280
do it.

2871
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:19,790
Definitely.

2872
01:18:19,790 --> 01:18:20,623
And Gentlemen,

2873
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:23,480
how about like that
Braveheart shit where they,

2874
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:26,510
the torture and what making
everybody watched the torture.

2875
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:29,630
Like that's might be
more bad ass because you,

2876
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:31,730
you're intentionally
keeping the guy alive.

2877
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:32,121
Yeah.

2878
01:18:32,121 --> 01:18:33,560
But that's killing someone.

2879
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:35,090
That's not like human sacrifice.

2880
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:35,830
Oh,

2881
01:18:35,830 --> 01:18:36,650
it's like,

2882
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:38,630
oh I guess you're saying is
it is a form of punishment,

2883
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:40,760
but they never sacrificing
the cool people.

2884
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:42,350
They're always sacrificing the assholes.

2885
01:18:42,351 --> 01:18:43,310
They don't like anyway.

2886
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:47,900
But by whose standards are they an
asshole that's a problem king or whoever.

2887
01:18:47,901 --> 01:18:49,100
He didn't give a fuck about them.

2888
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:49,461
Right.

2889
01:18:49,461 --> 01:18:50,061
But the king,

2890
01:18:50,061 --> 01:18:51,890
by the time the guy gets to be a king,

2891
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:55,040
who knows whether he's a
good guy or not his judgment.

2892
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:55,450
Oh,

2893
01:18:55,450 --> 01:18:55,640
he,

2894
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:58,520
I guarantee you he is not
Joe versus the volcano.

2895
01:18:58,521 --> 01:19:00,650
What does that Matt Ryan Movie.

2896
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:01,021
Yeah,

2897
01:19:01,021 --> 01:19:03,140
but Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan,

2898
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,930
something about sacrificing
something to them.

2899
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:06,501
Okay.

2900
01:19:06,501 --> 01:19:08,840
Now you sacrifice your fucking
hour and a half of your life.

2901
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:11,430
[inaudible]

2902
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:12,910
connection is sacrifice.

2903
01:19:12,930 --> 01:19:13,763
Big Meg,

2904
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:14,631
Meg Ryan,

2905
01:19:14,631 --> 01:19:15,530
Tom Hanks movie.

2906
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:16,151
Oh Christ.

2907
01:19:16,151 --> 01:19:19,310
Try watching like sleepless in Seattle.

2908
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:22,610
That was like one of the first
Internet based love affair movies.

2909
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:23,773
Oh God,

2910
01:19:24,910 --> 01:19:25,221
we may,

2911
01:19:25,221 --> 01:19:27,440
isn't that you've got
mail sleepless in Seattle.

2912
01:19:27,441 --> 01:19:29,510
They were having an online correspondence.

2913
01:19:29,511 --> 01:19:30,344
Right?

2914
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:30,951
I think that was,

2915
01:19:30,951 --> 01:19:32,360
you've got got mail,

2916
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:32,780
is it?

2917
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:33,170
Yeah.

2918
01:19:33,170 --> 01:19:34,940
What was sleepless in Seattle
was one where she had,

2919
01:19:35,030 --> 01:19:37,160
she squirted in the Deli or something.

2920
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:40,130
I remember she had to
orgasm in the restaurant.

2921
01:19:40,390 --> 01:19:40,631
Oh,

2922
01:19:40,631 --> 01:19:41,464
it's famous for that.

2923
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:43,520
It wasn't that also like,

2924
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:43,701
oh,

2925
01:19:43,701 --> 01:19:45,740
that was like they sent
each other actual letters.

2926
01:19:45,770 --> 01:19:46,603
Is that what it was?

2927
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:48,223
It was Billy crystal.

2928
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:48,460
Right,

2929
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:48,830
right.

2930
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:49,610
Yeah.

2931
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:51,320
So you've gotten mail was the first,

2932
01:19:52,010 --> 01:19:53,420
what year was you've got mail?

2933
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:56,630
I would say 95 six okay.

2934
01:19:56,631 --> 01:20:01,631
Let's say that out in Seattle 95 but
you see you've got mail that was an AOL

2935
01:20:02,691 --> 01:20:03,501
thing that it said.

2936
01:20:03,501 --> 01:20:04,500
Do you got mail?

2937
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:08,700
Sleepless in Seattle was 1993 yeah.

2938
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:09,061
Okay.

2939
01:20:09,061 --> 01:20:11,760
This is a radio talk
show that they called in.

2940
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:12,960
That's what it was.

2941
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:15,480
You've got mail in 1998 interesting.

2942
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:18,420
So 93 sleepless in Seattle was radio.

2943
01:20:18,421 --> 01:20:19,500
So that was before.

2944
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:19,771
Yeah,

2945
01:20:19,771 --> 01:20:24,771
that was [inaudible] 98 was essentially
you've got mail was like right when,

2946
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:28,980
four years into the Internet
invasion in our culture.

2947
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:32,470
That was probably all a
number 5.0 really confusing.

2948
01:20:32,471 --> 01:20:32,560
Yeah.

2949
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:33,310
Time.

2950
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:35,800
I've still know people
like old people who they,

2951
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:39,970
their perception of who AOL is
and what they do is all confused.

2952
01:20:40,270 --> 01:20:41,310
Like cause people will,

2953
01:20:41,311 --> 01:20:41,831
you know what I mean?

2954
01:20:41,831 --> 01:20:44,380
Like I don't want to call anybody out,

2955
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:48,160
but you know like AOL
was a service provider.

2956
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:50,740
They had a browser right at one time.

2957
01:20:50,741 --> 01:20:53,650
Like you would get a disc that
comes along with your service.

2958
01:20:53,651 --> 01:20:57,940
You sign up and you get a CD that you
have to put in and install their software.

2959
01:20:57,941 --> 01:20:58,774
Do you remember that?

2960
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:00,330
Yeah.

2961
01:21:00,330 --> 01:21:00,880
Yeah,

2962
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:01,910
so so then the,

2963
01:21:01,911 --> 01:21:03,870
and then they essentially
became a media company,

2964
01:21:03,871 --> 01:21:04,800
which is what they are now.

2965
01:21:04,801 --> 01:21:05,130
They have,

2966
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:06,240
they own some tech sites.

2967
01:21:06,241 --> 01:21:08,670
It's the reason I'm familiar and they
have of course their own website,

2968
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,930
but does anybody still use AOL
as a that's what I was wondering.

2969
01:21:13,230 --> 01:21:14,063
Yeah.

2970
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:14,760
Yeah.

2971
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:17,820
I think a lot of people still
actually use a gold weight.

2972
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:20,220
He sent me a fucking AOL email address.

2973
01:21:20,221 --> 01:21:20,940
There you go.

2974
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:21,331
I was like,

2975
01:21:21,331 --> 01:21:22,164
no way.

2976
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:23,243
There's still out there.

2977
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:23,611
He's like,

2978
01:21:23,611 --> 01:21:24,444
I'm old school.

2979
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:25,590
Dave is awesome.

2980
01:21:25,670 --> 01:21:28,230
The member direct directory
search got me leg.

2981
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:31,770
You used to be able to just type in your
address and it would find anybody who

2982
01:21:31,771 --> 01:21:36,150
had AOL around you based on your your
miles and I found out like girls that

2983
01:21:36,151 --> 01:21:38,670
lived down the street from me and then
I just started hooking up with them.

2984
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:40,990
They can probably fucking sued them.

2985
01:21:40,991 --> 01:21:45,350
So Burst Stalker Internet
privacy back then does not.

2986
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:46,920
No one knew what the fuck.

2987
01:21:46,921 --> 01:21:49,290
You can just send them a
message and I used to like,

2988
01:21:49,291 --> 01:21:49,710
you know,

2989
01:21:49,710 --> 01:21:51,180
anyone could get a message to anyway,

2990
01:21:51,181 --> 01:21:54,030
so like if your mom was on
AOL and she had an account,

2991
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:54,751
like somebody,

2992
01:21:54,751 --> 01:21:55,710
a stranger could just be like,

2993
01:21:55,711 --> 01:21:56,341
Hey lady,

2994
01:21:56,341 --> 01:21:57,031
you want to fuck.

2995
01:21:57,031 --> 01:21:57,864
I know.

2996
01:21:58,020 --> 01:22:03,020
Isn't it funny that like given the option
like message boards and AOL given the

2997
01:22:03,391 --> 01:22:04,770
option to use your actual name.

2998
01:22:04,771 --> 01:22:07,980
Like I have a message board
and my message board has shit,

2999
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:09,000
we'll look at it right now.

3000
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:13,410
I want to say like at
least 10 million posts.

3001
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:14,640
How many millions.

3002
01:22:14,670 --> 01:22:15,020
Okay.

3003
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:20,020
7 million posts in the main forum will
a half a million posts in the podcast

3004
01:22:21,871 --> 01:22:22,530
forum.

3005
01:22:22,530 --> 01:22:27,530
That combat sports forum is 697,000 the
cont farm is 1,700,000 that's the Oh g

3006
01:22:31,171 --> 01:22:32,160
message board right there.

3007
01:22:32,190 --> 01:22:34,350
So it's been around a long fucking time.

3008
01:22:34,351 --> 01:22:35,940
There's a lot of posts on it,

3009
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:37,313
but like

3010
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,400
the actual number of people
that use a real name,

3011
01:22:41,430 --> 01:22:42,270
it's almost none.

3012
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:42,991
Oh,

3013
01:22:42,991 --> 01:22:43,950
on a message board.

3014
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:44,461
Definitely,

3015
01:22:44,461 --> 01:22:44,671
yeah.

3016
01:22:44,671 --> 01:22:45,840
Given the opportunity.

3017
01:22:45,930 --> 01:22:46,141
Yeah.

3018
01:22:46,141 --> 01:22:46,351
I mean,

3019
01:22:46,351 --> 01:22:47,131
I use my real name,

3020
01:22:47,131 --> 01:22:48,550
but if I'll go through the,

3021
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:50,310
the podcast forum or the,

3022
01:22:50,311 --> 01:22:50,851
any of the form,

3023
01:22:50,851 --> 01:22:52,140
it's all crazy names.

3024
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:54,450
Shizam Biz,

3025
01:22:54,790 --> 01:22:56,640
a Wally writer.

3026
01:22:56,670 --> 01:22:57,331
DERPA.

3027
01:22:57,331 --> 01:22:57,631
I mean,

3028
01:22:57,631 --> 01:22:59,910
everyone's got these
whacking King Phoenix.

3029
01:22:59,911 --> 01:23:00,990
He's not your name on the fucker.

3030
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:02,940
People used to get with email too.

3031
01:23:02,941 --> 01:23:03,660
So how many,

3032
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:05,860
how many do you think
I got the number here?

3033
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:06,230
Uh,

3034
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:09,730
still use AOL per year as a service,

3035
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:11,940
as a service that they pay for a service.

3036
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:14,740
I will say,

3037
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:15,970
I'm going to say 4 million.

3038
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:17,163
Okay.

3039
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:20,390
What would you think this is
obviously us numbers only.

3040
01:23:20,430 --> 01:23:20,870
Yeah.

3041
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:21,703
Okay.

3042
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:23,920
How many people are currently
subscribers to the Internet?

3043
01:23:23,921 --> 01:23:24,770
Through AOL?

3044
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:28,480
You said 4 million.

3045
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:29,413
Four.

3046
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:32,530
And to think there's probably nothing
really just subscribed to any more.

3047
01:23:32,531 --> 01:23:33,001
It's just a,

3048
01:23:33,001 --> 01:23:34,030
well still charging them.

3049
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:37,160
I gotta think I gotta feel
like it's less than that.

3050
01:23:37,170 --> 01:23:37,850
I don't know.

3051
01:23:37,850 --> 01:23:39,360
I got to feel like I'm underestimating.

3052
01:23:39,361 --> 01:23:41,970
I feel like if I had 10 okay,

3053
01:23:41,971 --> 01:23:42,870
go do you want 10?

3054
01:23:42,990 --> 01:23:43,320
I'll say,

3055
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,640
I'll take 10 take 10 it's 2.5 million.

3056
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:46,770
That's pretty close.

3057
01:23:47,010 --> 01:23:47,843
I got greedy.

3058
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:54,680
It's amazing that it's 2 million.

3059
01:23:54,681 --> 01:23:55,740
So it's still a lot of people.

3060
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:56,970
What was it in its Hay Day?

3061
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:58,510
It's a good question.

3062
01:23:58,510 --> 01:23:58,920
I don't,

3063
01:23:58,920 --> 01:23:59,753
I remember,

3064
01:24:00,090 --> 01:24:00,601
wait a minute,

3065
01:24:00,601 --> 01:24:01,381
what was that merger?

3066
01:24:01,381 --> 01:24:02,790
It was time and AOL time.

3067
01:24:02,791 --> 01:24:03,690
Media and AOL,

3068
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:04,350
right?

3069
01:24:04,350 --> 01:24:04,591
Yeah.

3070
01:24:04,591 --> 01:24:08,730
It was like the epitome
of the DOTCOM fallout.

3071
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:10,490
Like that acquisition where they value,

3072
01:24:10,530 --> 01:24:12,960
they valued AOL at some enormous figure.

3073
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:14,190
I think I'm right about that.

3074
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:16,500
I'm talking about a lot of things today.

3075
01:24:16,501 --> 01:24:17,334
Worms.

3076
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:19,380
Welcome to the puck.

3077
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,120
Well now it's just,

3078
01:24:21,121 --> 01:24:21,541
that's a hill.

3079
01:24:21,541 --> 01:24:22,170
Well yeah,

3080
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:25,350
you could just do all the
new site similar to Yahoo.

3081
01:24:25,410 --> 01:24:25,741
Wow.

3082
01:24:25,741 --> 01:24:27,270
It looks so weird.

3083
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:28,800
Weird.

3084
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,480
It's looks so odd.

3085
01:24:30,510 --> 01:24:31,343
Yup.

3086
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:32,810
And see there's an exact,

3087
01:24:32,811 --> 01:24:34,840
remember how we were talking
about traditional media before.

3088
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:40,080
There is an example of a company
essentially losing its foothold in an

3089
01:24:40,810 --> 01:24:45,810
incredibly short span of time where they
were the way to get on the internet and

3090
01:24:46,121 --> 01:24:48,760
then a decade later there are news site.

3091
01:24:48,990 --> 01:24:49,450
Yeah,

3092
01:24:49,450 --> 01:24:49,901
Whoa,

3093
01:24:49,901 --> 01:24:50,440
wait a minute.

3094
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:51,640
And they started buying up,

3095
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:52,450
you know,

3096
01:24:52,450 --> 01:24:53,350
media properties,

3097
01:24:53,351 --> 01:24:54,610
websites that are successful,

3098
01:24:54,611 --> 01:24:54,971
et cetera.

3099
01:24:54,971 --> 01:24:57,580
Trying to get back into
the game in some way.

3100
01:24:58,030 --> 01:24:59,290
But that's a,

3101
01:24:59,291 --> 01:24:59,980
that's another,

3102
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:01,240
that's an example of how,

3103
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:03,820
how the acceleration is happening now,

3104
01:25:03,850 --> 01:25:07,090
where adaptation is more
necessary than ever.

3105
01:25:07,091 --> 01:25:09,820
You can never rest on what
you're currently doing.

3106
01:25:09,821 --> 01:25:11,850
You always have to be moving
onto the next thing because,

3107
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:12,870
or your

3108
01:25:12,870 --> 01:25:13,890
or you turn into a well.

3109
01:25:14,430 --> 01:25:14,791
Yeah.

3110
01:25:14,791 --> 01:25:18,870
And there's also going to be times where
whatever you use to do just doesn't

3111
01:25:18,871 --> 01:25:19,704
exist anymore.

3112
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:20,760
It's going to go away.

3113
01:25:20,761 --> 01:25:21,780
Like if,

3114
01:25:21,930 --> 01:25:25,290
if blockbuster tried to
stay open in some way,

3115
01:25:25,291 --> 01:25:26,220
shape or form,

3116
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:27,360
it wouldn't have made it.

3117
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:29,100
Nobody needs that anymore.

3118
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:30,720
So it went away.

3119
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:31,290
No.

3120
01:25:31,290 --> 01:25:31,591
You know,

3121
01:25:31,591 --> 01:25:34,740
there's going to be a lot of those kinds
of things when things turn digital,

3122
01:25:34,741 --> 01:25:35,880
like record stores are,

3123
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:36,900
they still exist,

3124
01:25:36,901 --> 01:25:39,930
but it's because records
have become kind of cool.

3125
01:25:39,990 --> 01:25:40,170
Yeah,

3126
01:25:40,170 --> 01:25:41,400
like an actual record.

3127
01:25:41,401 --> 01:25:44,490
It'll always be there in some format,

3128
01:25:44,580 --> 01:25:46,350
but it just won't be the status quo.

3129
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:47,550
Like comic book stores,

3130
01:25:48,210 --> 01:25:52,270
like Comic Book Stores are cool because
to have a physical copy of Spiderman one

3131
01:25:52,271 --> 01:25:52,980
is pretty dope.

3132
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:53,813
But you know what,

3133
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,440
you can get that marvel has an
app that you can get on your iPad.

3134
01:25:58,560 --> 01:25:59,220
Right.

3135
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:04,220
And you watch comic books on an
Ipod on better comics met marvel.

3136
01:26:04,371 --> 01:26:04,970
I think it's more,

3137
01:26:04,970 --> 01:26:05,601
marvel has one.

3138
01:26:05,601 --> 01:26:08,780
There's also another really big one I
think is called comics Ologie or something

3139
01:26:08,781 --> 01:26:09,550
like that.

3140
01:26:09,550 --> 01:26:10,940
They had recently purchased by Amazon.

3141
01:26:10,941 --> 01:26:11,450
Anyway,

3142
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:11,811
I'm sorry.

3143
01:26:11,811 --> 01:26:16,811
It's the best way to look at comic books
because you flip frame by frame so you

3144
01:26:17,121 --> 01:26:18,050
don't have spoilers.

3145
01:26:18,051 --> 01:26:18,440
Like you know,

3146
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:19,910
sometimes you'd be reading a comic book,

3147
01:26:19,911 --> 01:26:20,660
you see the next page.

3148
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:20,780
Yeah.

3149
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:23,630
You see the explosion that's
in the next page and you go,

3150
01:26:23,690 --> 01:26:25,130
Oh damn,

3151
01:26:25,131 --> 01:26:25,880
that's going to happen.

3152
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:26,750
It's actually better.

3153
01:26:26,930 --> 01:26:29,870
What's the bids is better because
you're literally going frame by frame.

3154
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:33,260
Every frame is in a unique and rain and
you put it down and pick it back up.

3155
01:26:33,261 --> 01:26:38,090
You're right where you left off dude
reading comic books and also it's not like

3156
01:26:38,091 --> 01:26:39,140
a limited edition.

3157
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:39,973
You can't get it.

3158
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:43,130
They could reproduce every
God damn Concorde that ever
existed in a digital form

3159
01:26:43,310 --> 01:26:45,740
and they'd be fools not to and
they could do like Netflix,

3160
01:26:45,741 --> 01:26:48,500
like subscription packages where
you could just read all you can.

3161
01:26:48,810 --> 01:26:49,200
Yeah.

3162
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:50,900
Not Actually had to buy them as one.

3163
01:26:50,901 --> 01:26:53,840
If you're willing to pay a monthly
fee or something like that to make it

3164
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:58,900
accessible to the average fan and the
real big wig sort of comic book collectors

3165
01:27:00,201 --> 01:27:01,034
that are willing to pay.

3166
01:27:01,670 --> 01:27:03,350
How much is Spiderman one co worth?

3167
01:27:03,410 --> 01:27:03,950
Oh,

3168
01:27:03,950 --> 01:27:04,670
I have no idea.

3169
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:05,950
Probably that's an interesting answer.

3170
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:06,261
Money,

3171
01:27:06,261 --> 01:27:07,094
right?

3172
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:07,851
Spiderman,

3173
01:27:07,851 --> 01:27:09,440
one insane amounts of million bucks.

3174
01:27:09,441 --> 01:27:09,950
I don't know.

3175
01:27:09,950 --> 01:27:10,970
Something crazy like that.

3176
01:27:10,971 --> 01:27:12,350
Most people are not going to have it,

3177
01:27:12,890 --> 01:27:16,880
but you could easily get it if
you're a regular kid who had an iPad.

3178
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:19,610
Like they could just upload it
digitally and it'd be great.

3179
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:19,970
Yeah,

3180
01:27:19,970 --> 01:27:20,750
no problem.

3181
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:21,630
And it would make thing.

3182
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:22,700
There's this fear though.

3183
01:27:22,790 --> 01:27:24,890
There's this fear though
that it brings down,

3184
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:28,370
it has the potential to bring down the
overall economic value of the more of

3185
01:27:28,371 --> 01:27:33,371
that independent marketplace where if
people aren't going out and spending $8

3186
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:34,873
per,

3187
01:27:35,390 --> 01:27:35,661
you know,

3188
01:27:35,661 --> 01:27:36,494
per,

3189
01:27:36,650 --> 01:27:36,831
uh,

3190
01:27:36,831 --> 01:27:38,480
comic than overall,

3191
01:27:38,481 --> 01:27:39,380
there might be less money.

3192
01:27:39,381 --> 01:27:42,410
They're less incentive to get
into it and less like this is,

3193
01:27:42,411 --> 01:27:44,120
this is the music businesses argument,

3194
01:27:44,121 --> 01:27:44,450
right?

3195
01:27:44,450 --> 01:27:45,950
About independent stuff.

3196
01:27:46,370 --> 01:27:48,590
So don't think that that
makes any sense though,

3197
01:27:48,591 --> 01:27:52,370
because I think that you're just
going to make people more excited.

3198
01:27:52,610 --> 01:27:56,540
You're dealing with 350 million
people in this country alone,

3199
01:27:56,670 --> 01:27:56,840
right?

3200
01:27:56,840 --> 01:28:00,660
You're getting more access to the comic
book and I think it's going to make them

3201
01:28:00,661 --> 01:28:01,401
more excited about it.

3202
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:04,670
The physical copies still going to
be worth a massive amount of money.

3203
01:28:04,671 --> 01:28:06,320
I don't think it undervalues it at all.

3204
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:06,741
I think,

3205
01:28:06,741 --> 01:28:07,490
in fact,

3206
01:28:07,490 --> 01:28:11,150
it probably makes it more exciting
to actually hold the copy of it.

3207
01:28:11,210 --> 01:28:11,481
Right.

3208
01:28:11,481 --> 01:28:12,020
But there,

3209
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:14,990
but there will be fewer comic book
stores than there were before.

3210
01:28:15,470 --> 01:28:16,460
Will there be?

3211
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:17,121
I don't.

3212
01:28:17,121 --> 01:28:17,660
I don't know.

3213
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:18,930
I don't even know how many exist.

3214
01:28:18,931 --> 01:28:22,280
Still love to have the physical
thing in front of them.

3215
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:23,030
Yeah,

3216
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:23,631
I do too.

3217
01:28:23,631 --> 01:28:23,991
I don't know.

3218
01:28:23,991 --> 01:28:24,824
I think it's a mix.

3219
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:25,980
If you look at like,

3220
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:26,750
Eh,

3221
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:27,340
well,

3222
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:27,740
eh,

3223
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:28,281
for example,

3224
01:28:28,281 --> 01:28:29,114
movies,

3225
01:28:29,150 --> 01:28:31,790
could you sustain a big budget?

3226
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:32,900
Michael Bay?

3227
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:35,570
How much money does he
spend on transformers?

3228
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:41,510
If people aren't going to go to the movie
theater and spend $15 in another 10 on

3229
01:28:41,511 --> 01:28:42,344
popcorn,

3230
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:45,200
is Michael Bay able to
make his movies anymore?

3231
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:46,730
Yeah,

3232
01:28:46,730 --> 01:28:47,181
he is.

3233
01:28:47,181 --> 01:28:47,571
Yeah.

3234
01:28:47,571 --> 01:28:48,381
At the same budget.

3235
01:28:48,381 --> 01:28:49,730
You buy them online.

3236
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:50,961
Right.

3237
01:28:50,961 --> 01:28:53,420
But that's what I mean is
the consumption medium.

3238
01:28:53,421 --> 01:28:54,290
Once you're online,

3239
01:28:54,291 --> 01:28:57,350
you're expectation is that it's not going
to cost you as much as it costs you at

3240
01:28:57,351 --> 01:28:58,040
the theater.

3241
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:00,830
It's the context of the theater that
pulls that money out of your pocket.

3242
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:02,490
The highest number

3243
01:29:02,490 --> 01:29:06,690
Spiderman one has generated
is this for the grade,

3244
01:29:06,890 --> 01:29:07,620
the grade them front,

3245
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:12,620
of course 0.5 which is a complete magazine
at 1.0 which is a very poor 0.5 is

3246
01:29:15,271 --> 01:29:20,271
fetched as much as $1,600 for a
complete shitty torn apart Spiderman.

3247
01:29:20,590 --> 01:29:21,270
Wow.

3248
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:22,170
For the highest grade.

3249
01:29:22,171 --> 01:29:23,130
For a perfect copy.

3250
01:29:23,131 --> 01:29:24,450
1.1 million.

3251
01:29:24,570 --> 01:29:25,740
I was close on that estimate.

3252
01:29:25,741 --> 01:29:26,100
Yeah,

3253
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:26,933
you're dead on.

3254
01:29:27,330 --> 01:29:29,490
And that's a amazing fantasy.

3255
01:29:30,630 --> 01:29:31,470
It's only the,

3256
01:29:31,471 --> 01:29:31,950
um,

3257
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:33,600
that is the original Spiderman.

3258
01:29:33,690 --> 01:29:38,690
Amazing fantasy had Spiderman on the
cover and it was the very first time that

3259
01:29:39,151 --> 01:29:40,580
we were introduced to Spiderman.

3260
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:43,260
It's only the third comic
book to break $1 million.

3261
01:29:43,261 --> 01:29:44,730
The other two are action comics,

3262
01:29:44,731 --> 01:29:48,240
number one and detective comics number 27.

3263
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:49,493
Amazing.

3264
01:29:49,950 --> 01:29:52,020
But I mean books for some paper see,

3265
01:29:52,021 --> 01:29:52,854
but people,

3266
01:29:52,870 --> 01:29:53,701
but look at there,

3267
01:29:53,701 --> 01:29:55,550
it's like the shitty version of it.

3268
01:29:55,551 --> 01:29:56,281
It's all fucked up.

3269
01:29:56,281 --> 01:29:59,070
It's only when we're 1600
bucks but the best perfect,

3270
01:29:59,071 --> 01:29:59,521
crisp,

3271
01:29:59,521 --> 01:30:01,230
clean as a huge gap.

3272
01:30:02,190 --> 01:30:03,600
I think there's always going to be that.

3273
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:04,140
Again,

3274
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:06,890
I completely agree with you that
that's always going to exist to,

3275
01:30:06,891 --> 01:30:08,390
I guess the part I'm talking about,

3276
01:30:08,391 --> 01:30:12,530
it's just more mass consumption that if
the mass consumption medium was paper

3277
01:30:12,531 --> 01:30:14,300
that needed to be distributed everywhere,

3278
01:30:14,510 --> 01:30:18,470
the average cost of consumption for the
average user would be higher than it is

3279
01:30:18,471 --> 01:30:19,820
in a subscription based model.

3280
01:30:20,030 --> 01:30:22,190
Like Netflix for example is $8 a month.

3281
01:30:22,191 --> 01:30:24,410
But what did you spend on
rentals before Netflix exists?

3282
01:30:24,410 --> 01:30:25,250
Did a lot more,

3283
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:25,940
lot more.

3284
01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:26,241
Yeah,

3285
01:30:26,241 --> 01:30:26,691
that's true.

3286
01:30:26,691 --> 01:30:27,770
That's a good way of looking at it.

3287
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:28,731
And also,

3288
01:30:28,731 --> 01:30:29,360
um,

3289
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:31,910
the amount of comics that are released,

3290
01:30:31,911 --> 01:30:34,040
like new ones that are digitally released,

3291
01:30:34,041 --> 01:30:34,310
right?

3292
01:30:34,310 --> 01:30:35,143
Like right now,

3293
01:30:35,210 --> 01:30:37,790
the amount of apps just
for viewing comic books is,

3294
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:39,320
you know there's a cop ball,

3295
01:30:39,321 --> 01:30:40,790
but it's not like the same.

3296
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:44,330
I mean if you used to be able to go to
any grocery store anywhere and there

3297
01:30:44,331 --> 01:30:46,050
would be an aisle that had comic books,

3298
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:50,150
there'd be like a thing that spun around
that little rack that had comic books

3299
01:30:50,151 --> 01:30:53,900
on it that slowly is going to be digital.

3300
01:30:53,901 --> 01:30:54,070
Yeah.

3301
01:30:54,070 --> 01:30:58,690
So it's Kinda like our Amazon conversation
from earlier where streamlining the

3302
01:30:58,691 --> 01:31:01,830
delivery method inevitably
cuts money from,

3303
01:31:01,930 --> 01:31:03,490
from that transaction.

3304
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:05,241
It kind of does,

3305
01:31:05,241 --> 01:31:05,750
I guess be,

3306
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:06,630
can't think that,

3307
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:06,910
no,

3308
01:31:06,910 --> 01:31:07,050
no,

3309
01:31:07,050 --> 01:31:07,320
no.

3310
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:08,610
I'm not supporting that.

3311
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:14,540
I'm just saying that that's the counter
argument in all this stuff and probably

3312
01:31:14,611 --> 01:31:18,600
the better analogy is the Michael Bay
one is this idea that the traditional

3313
01:31:18,601 --> 01:31:20,070
model as fucked up as it is,

3314
01:31:20,071 --> 01:31:22,230
and maybe the most original
ideas aren't getting out.

3315
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:23,970
It generates a fuck ton of money.

3316
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:25,100
Yeah.

3317
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:25,851
It's interesting,

3318
01:31:25,851 --> 01:31:29,540
but it's an inevitable part of innovation.

3319
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:33,970
Like the horse shoe maker of the 18
hundreds it's probably so pissed when cars

3320
01:31:33,980 --> 01:31:34,570
came along.

3321
01:31:34,570 --> 01:31:34,790
Yeah.

3322
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:35,001
Yeah.

3323
01:31:35,001 --> 01:31:36,740
He's definitely got this
fucking house with a horse.

3324
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:37,574
Shoes.

3325
01:31:37,730 --> 01:31:38,280
My whole,

3326
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:40,090
my kingdom is from horseshoes.

3327
01:31:40,390 --> 01:31:41,540
I'd like to see his reaction.

3328
01:31:41,541 --> 01:31:42,710
He's probably so mad.

3329
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:45,590
You know guys probably
going ape shit right now.

3330
01:31:45,591 --> 01:31:46,850
You don't need a fucking car.

3331
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:47,750
Okay.

3332
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:48,860
He's not that expensive.

3333
01:31:49,010 --> 01:31:50,510
All of a sudden he became Jerry Seinfeld.

3334
01:31:50,810 --> 01:31:51,610
I don't know.

3335
01:31:51,610 --> 01:31:52,443
Well,

3336
01:31:53,710 --> 01:31:54,251
why do you need,

3337
01:31:54,251 --> 01:31:54,920
Hey,

3338
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:56,420
he strikes me as a
horse shoe kind of game.

3339
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:56,900
Oh,

3340
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:57,740
he's a car guy.

3341
01:31:58,160 --> 01:31:59,500
Opposite of a horse guys.

3342
01:31:59,560 --> 01:31:59,740
True.

3343
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:00,310
Like a million

3344
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:00,760
cars.

3345
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:00,970
Right.

3346
01:32:00,970 --> 01:32:01,900
But he's got old ones.

3347
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:02,951
Yeah.

3348
01:32:02,951 --> 01:32:04,330
The thing is Olin torches,

3349
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:05,290
that's his main thing though.

3350
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:06,490
Porsche's his main thing.

3351
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:07,600
Porsche nine 11.

3352
01:32:07,601 --> 01:32:10,930
She's got like some
ungodly number of portion.

3353
01:32:11,410 --> 01:32:12,640
Better cars overall.

3354
01:32:12,641 --> 01:32:13,270
Him Or Leno?

3355
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:14,010
Leno.

3356
01:32:14,010 --> 01:32:14,843
Wow.

3357
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:17,200
Leno was a gangster.

3358
01:32:17,380 --> 01:32:21,430
He has a full time staff that takes
care of his cars there in a warehouse.

3359
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:22,480
Jeez.

3360
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:23,890
He has her online show.

3361
01:32:23,891 --> 01:32:24,131
Yeah,

3362
01:32:24,131 --> 01:32:26,440
he's got some giant slate airport.

3363
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:27,100
Wow.

3364
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:28,210
He also has a,

3365
01:32:28,211 --> 01:32:28,870
um,

3366
01:32:28,870 --> 01:32:29,411
a show,

3367
01:32:29,411 --> 01:32:33,640
a web show that he does like all
based on cars breaking down cars.

3368
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:35,440
Seinfeld has that cars and coffee.

3369
01:32:35,441 --> 01:32:36,274
She has watched it.

3370
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:37,270
He's pretty close.

3371
01:32:37,271 --> 01:32:37,691
It's close.

3372
01:32:37,691 --> 01:32:38,290
Second.

3373
01:32:38,290 --> 01:32:39,550
His show is more a,

3374
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:40,810
I mean it's a little bit about the car,

3375
01:32:40,811 --> 01:32:43,030
but more about hanging out
with unique individuals.

3376
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:44,013
I don't mind that show.

3377
01:32:44,110 --> 01:32:44,471
No,

3378
01:32:44,471 --> 01:32:45,304
it's not bad.

3379
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:50,340
You think about a traditional media
guy from 90 the nineties I think it's a

3380
01:32:50,561 --> 01:32:51,670
decent transition.

3381
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:53,890
It's definitely better than
that marriage ref thing.

3382
01:32:53,891 --> 01:32:54,970
Whatever that was on TV.

3383
01:32:55,030 --> 01:32:55,780
That was dog shit.

3384
01:32:55,780 --> 01:32:56,410
Yeah.

3385
01:32:56,410 --> 01:32:56,801
Yeah.

3386
01:32:56,801 --> 01:32:58,210
But you can't fix marriages.

3387
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,920
Who the fuck told you to fix marriages?

3388
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:01,100
This is how you fix it.

3389
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:01,933
You break up,

3390
01:33:03,670 --> 01:33:05,200
he break them and you
tell the people that get,

3391
01:33:05,201 --> 01:33:08,410
get your shit together and meet somebody
else and don't let this happen again.

3392
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:09,010
Yeah.

3393
01:33:09,010 --> 01:33:10,840
Don't let it get to the
point where you're on TV,

3394
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:12,490
working at your grievances,

3395
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:14,980
sniping at each other in front of America.

3396
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:15,480
But he,

3397
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:17,110
his his coffee show a car,

3398
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:18,520
comedians in cars or whatever.

3399
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:20,590
It kind of has like a podcast
vibe to it a little bit.

3400
01:33:20,630 --> 01:33:21,041
Very much.

3401
01:33:21,041 --> 01:33:23,800
So it's probably edited a
little too much for my taste,

3402
01:33:23,801 --> 01:33:27,580
but otherwise I feel like you're sort
of getting an uncensored version of both

3403
01:33:27,581 --> 01:33:28,414
individuals.

3404
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:29,080
Pretty much.

3405
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:29,561
Yeah.

3406
01:33:29,561 --> 01:33:33,100
And it's also a passion project,

3407
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:36,400
whereas he doesn't need any money
exactly how he doesn't make much from it.

3408
01:33:36,530 --> 01:33:38,650
Although they're still getting
those accurate ads in there.

3409
01:33:38,830 --> 01:33:41,050
They are sure they're nice and smooth too.

3410
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:42,370
And they're good ads.

3411
01:33:42,610 --> 01:33:43,150
Um,

3412
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:43,983
he's good at it.

3413
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:45,240
He's good at the show.

3414
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:46,750
He really loves cars.

3415
01:33:46,810 --> 01:33:48,750
But that's what's why
it's passion projects.

3416
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:49,360
Like he's,

3417
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:50,081
he really is a guy.

3418
01:33:50,081 --> 01:33:55,081
Like he was driving a
1973 Porsche nine 11 rs,

3419
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:57,640
which is a very rare car.

3420
01:33:57,641 --> 01:33:58,690
It's worth $1 million.

3421
01:33:59,230 --> 01:33:59,591
Yeah.

3422
01:33:59,591 --> 01:34:01,570
And he was driving it around with someone.

3423
01:34:01,650 --> 01:34:02,140
Uh,

3424
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:03,070
I forget who it was.

3425
01:34:03,071 --> 01:34:03,940
It was in the car with them,

3426
01:34:04,150 --> 01:34:06,940
but I think it's the guy who
hosts Seth Meyers that his name.

3427
01:34:07,270 --> 01:34:07,690
Yeah,

3428
01:34:07,690 --> 01:34:08,290
that guy.

3429
01:34:08,290 --> 01:34:09,080
I think it was him,

3430
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:09,670
one of those,

3431
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:10,780
some comedian character,

3432
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:11,370
whoever it was.

3433
01:34:11,370 --> 01:34:11,800
Sure.

3434
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:12,371
And you know,

3435
01:34:12,371 --> 01:34:15,190
you could tell as he's describing the car,

3436
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:16,930
like these are Gerry's words,

3437
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:18,640
these are real car nut.

3438
01:34:18,850 --> 01:34:19,683
So it really,

3439
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:23,400
there's such a difference between that
and someone who is just doing that eight

3440
01:34:23,401 --> 01:34:24,010
gig.

3441
01:34:24,010 --> 01:34:28,030
Like there's plenty of those guys online
that are doing the car gig because they

3442
01:34:28,031 --> 01:34:31,570
could have been a weather caster or
they could have been journalism's.

3443
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:32,020
Yeah.

3444
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:32,950
Not even that.

3445
01:34:32,951 --> 01:34:33,161
I mean,

3446
01:34:33,161 --> 01:34:35,710
it could have been a fucking
top 40 DJ or something.

3447
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:36,010
Right.

3448
01:34:36,010 --> 01:34:38,230
But instead they're reviewing cars.

3449
01:34:38,231 --> 01:34:41,980
This is the automatic
transition transmission,

3450
01:34:42,170 --> 01:34:43,540
Kris Krane speed.

3451
01:34:43,541 --> 01:34:44,860
Dual clutch setup.

3452
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:45,290
Yeah.

3453
01:34:45,290 --> 01:34:47,500
It is a difference between
that and like Matt Farah,

3454
01:34:47,501 --> 01:34:50,050
who's a friend of mine who
has a show called drive,

3455
01:34:50,350 --> 01:34:51,011
he's on that.

3456
01:34:51,011 --> 01:34:53,530
And pretty much if you got
a script in a teleprompter,

3457
01:34:53,531 --> 01:34:54,364
you're doing it wrong.

3458
01:34:54,550 --> 01:34:55,030
Yeah.

3459
01:34:55,030 --> 01:34:58,160
And that's the thing about like,

3460
01:34:58,370 --> 01:35:00,860
if you can pursue your interests,

3461
01:35:01,090 --> 01:35:02,570
you will never work a day in your life.

3462
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:07,010
If you can actually find a job where
you're doing what you love and lasts,

3463
01:35:07,070 --> 01:35:08,210
it becomes a burden,

3464
01:35:08,211 --> 01:35:10,040
which also you can fuck up.

3465
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:11,390
You can fuck up.

3466
01:35:11,391 --> 01:35:13,610
And the thing that you
love can become your,

3467
01:35:13,611 --> 01:35:13,821
you know,

3468
01:35:13,821 --> 01:35:15,110
it's like marrying your mistress,

3469
01:35:15,111 --> 01:35:15,280
you know?

3470
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:15,900
Yeah.

3471
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:18,690
At least you're still doing it
your way and fucking up your way.

3472
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:19,140
Yeah.

3473
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:19,660
You know,

3474
01:35:19,660 --> 01:35:20,131
it's still,

3475
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:23,790
it's so different than having somebody
else tell you what's right and wrong.

3476
01:35:23,820 --> 01:35:25,900
Take spirits at yourself like,

3477
01:35:25,990 --> 01:35:27,240
like sort of like the bicycle thing.

3478
01:35:27,241 --> 01:35:28,270
Someone can tell you you can,

3479
01:35:28,271 --> 01:35:28,921
you're going to fall,

3480
01:35:28,921 --> 01:35:29,450
but it's,

3481
01:35:29,450 --> 01:35:32,880
you're never going to learn as fast
as experiencing the failure and,

3482
01:35:32,910 --> 01:35:33,540
and,

3483
01:35:33,540 --> 01:35:34,100
and uh,

3484
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:35,460
iterating based on it.

3485
01:35:35,490 --> 01:35:35,761
You know,

3486
01:35:35,761 --> 01:35:39,420
that's something that I think
makes like youtube for example,

3487
01:35:39,421 --> 01:35:44,421
so great is that the content producers
themselves is keeping track of so many

3488
01:35:44,581 --> 01:35:46,250
different war producers were created,

3489
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:47,190
were conning creators,

3490
01:35:47,191 --> 01:35:47,641
writers,

3491
01:35:47,641 --> 01:35:48,270
whatever,

3492
01:35:48,270 --> 01:35:48,870
whatever,

3493
01:35:48,870 --> 01:35:50,280
wearing all these different hats.

3494
01:35:50,281 --> 01:35:52,020
So you get to essentially see,

3495
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:52,531
uh,

3496
01:35:52,531 --> 01:35:54,180
so many different perspectives on,

3497
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:55,170
on the output.

3498
01:35:55,171 --> 01:35:59,230
What would eventually becomes the
video and that job used to take def,

3499
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:01,590
that's a super common
question I get when people,

3500
01:36:01,591 --> 01:36:03,090
when I talk to people is you do the,

3501
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:04,590
you mean you do all that on your own?

3502
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:05,280
All of it.

3503
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:05,721
Like what,

3504
01:36:05,721 --> 01:36:06,420
where's the,

3505
01:36:06,420 --> 01:36:07,260
what about the camera guy?

3506
01:36:07,261 --> 01:36:08,094
What about this game,

3507
01:36:08,310 --> 01:36:08,881
that guide,

3508
01:36:08,881 --> 01:36:09,714
et Cetera.

3509
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:10,560
And,

3510
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:11,040
uh,

3511
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:15,480
but there is some level of control and
creativity and imagination that can come

3512
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,970
free when you know how to do everything.

3513
01:36:18,630 --> 01:36:19,141
You know what I mean?

3514
01:36:19,141 --> 01:36:19,890
When there aren't,

3515
01:36:19,890 --> 01:36:21,510
you aren't seeing physical
barriers everywhere.

3516
01:36:21,511 --> 01:36:21,900
You're like,

3517
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:22,800
I know how to do that.

3518
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:23,251
Well,

3519
01:36:23,251 --> 01:36:28,251
you also seeing you in
an undirected atmosphere.

3520
01:36:28,351 --> 01:36:28,840
Exactly.

3521
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:29,670
Really you,

3522
01:36:29,670 --> 01:36:30,840
and you're an interesting guy.

3523
01:36:30,841 --> 01:36:33,680
You're a passionate guy about all these
different things that you're reviewing.

3524
01:36:33,681 --> 01:36:34,080
So it's,

3525
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:34,321
it's,

3526
01:36:34,321 --> 01:36:35,460
it draws you in.

3527
01:36:35,610 --> 01:36:36,443
There's no,

3528
01:36:36,450 --> 01:36:38,700
there's no fakeness to it all.

3529
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:42,030
There's no way in the very
produced late in the back,

3530
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:44,040
all of us had ideas,

3531
01:36:44,041 --> 01:36:44,850
you know what I mean?

3532
01:36:44,850 --> 01:36:48,660
Everyone was directing everyone else
and themselves and the whole thing.

3533
01:36:48,661 --> 01:36:52,770
And if in a more regimented environment,

3534
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,440
it just sucks the life out of everything.

3535
01:36:55,441 --> 01:36:58,280
What we were talking about that if we had
a producer back there that was calling

3536
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,220
the clipboard,

3537
01:36:59,220 --> 01:37:01,560
meanwhile I was just five
guys laughing at steris.

3538
01:37:01,561 --> 01:37:01,861
Right.

3539
01:37:01,861 --> 01:37:02,730
And just like,

3540
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:04,350
and trying to make the best video too.

3541
01:37:04,351 --> 01:37:07,290
Like everybody's idea was
clearly about trying to like,

3542
01:37:07,291 --> 01:37:08,340
maybe we could get this shot.

3543
01:37:08,350 --> 01:37:08,960
What about that?

3544
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,110
Maybe we could do that or this.

3545
01:37:10,111 --> 01:37:13,680
And it became like we were ramping it
up and escalating it to make it better.

3546
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:14,630
And I feel like,

3547
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:19,460
I feel like that's what exposes the
traditional media model in the sense that

3548
01:37:19,461 --> 01:37:21,080
like if we're having fun,

3549
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:22,820
it's going to come through.

3550
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:26,690
Coming back to the social media kind
of element were for these guys friends,

3551
01:37:26,930 --> 01:37:29,650
we need to get as close to
the experience of having them,

3552
01:37:29,790 --> 01:37:29,990
uh,

3553
01:37:29,990 --> 01:37:33,200
here as we can for them to
get the most out of the video.

3554
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:34,393
And every,

3555
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:39,400
every time you put this businessperson
or whoever in between that communication

3556
01:37:39,501 --> 01:37:40,280
spectrum,

3557
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:45,280
all of a sudden there's this filter and
audiences are more sophisticated than

3558
01:37:45,501 --> 01:37:45,741
ever.

3559
01:37:45,741 --> 01:37:48,380
And that's why I feel
like youtube is the place.

3560
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:53,300
It's the ultimate battleground because
everybody has equal access to viewership.

3561
01:37:53,630 --> 01:37:57,090
And so you can come with your big budget
and you can come with your fancy voice,

3562
01:37:57,091 --> 01:37:58,030
the one you were doing there,

3563
01:37:58,170 --> 01:37:59,430
the fancy boy,

3564
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:00,780
you can come with your million dollars.

3565
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:01,410
In fact,

3566
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:03,510
bringing in million dollar ring it,

3567
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:05,160
bring it in new organic shit.

3568
01:38:05,161 --> 01:38:05,910
We'll win.

3569
01:38:05,910 --> 01:38:06,570
In fact,

3570
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:07,111
in fact,

3571
01:38:07,111 --> 01:38:08,190
a couple of years ago,

3572
01:38:08,220 --> 01:38:09,360
maybe a couple of years ago,

3573
01:38:09,390 --> 01:38:11,850
Google thought we need more
premium content on youtube.

3574
01:38:11,851 --> 01:38:13,980
So they had the launched this
premium content initiative,

3575
01:38:13,981 --> 01:38:15,480
spent an enormous amount of money,

3576
01:38:15,481 --> 01:38:19,470
like $100 million to convince traditional
media people to bring their content to

3577
01:38:19,471 --> 01:38:20,130
youtube.

3578
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:22,450
Almost everything within that initiative,

3579
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:23,820
a initiative bombed.

3580
01:38:24,410 --> 01:38:24,960
Wow.

3581
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:25,230
Fuck.

3582
01:38:25,230 --> 01:38:28,950
It wasn't a passion based because it
wasn't passion based and it wasn't organic

3583
01:38:28,951 --> 01:38:30,120
to the platform.

3584
01:38:30,150 --> 01:38:34,920
It was this really weird kind
of Frankenstein version of it.

3585
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:35,670
You know,

3586
01:38:35,670 --> 01:38:35,920
and I,

3587
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:36,271
you know,

3588
01:38:36,271 --> 01:38:36,530
I'm,

3589
01:38:36,530 --> 01:38:36,930
I'm,

3590
01:38:36,930 --> 01:38:38,280
I'm really passionate about it.

3591
01:38:38,281 --> 01:38:41,730
I'm really passionate about people
that are web native remaining that way,

3592
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:42,271
you know,

3593
01:38:42,271 --> 01:38:43,320
and a fat paycheck.

3594
01:38:43,321 --> 01:38:44,700
Not necessarily changing that.

3595
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:45,981
Yeah,

3596
01:38:45,981 --> 01:38:47,990
I don't think it would
change that for you.

3597
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:48,291
You,

3598
01:38:48,291 --> 01:38:48,591
you,

3599
01:38:48,591 --> 01:38:50,240
you really do enjoy it and love it.

3600
01:38:50,241 --> 01:38:55,040
And the only thing that would
change is if it became a burden,

3601
01:38:55,310 --> 01:38:55,611
you know,

3602
01:38:55,611 --> 01:38:58,640
if it became you are
beholden to another company,

3603
01:38:58,641 --> 01:38:59,840
you are beholden to,

3604
01:39:00,230 --> 01:39:02,780
if you had Sony sponsors unblocked,

3605
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:05,690
but Sony sponsored unbox therapy or,

3606
01:39:05,810 --> 01:39:06,643
well dude,

3607
01:39:06,650 --> 01:39:07,483
I mean it's not,

3608
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:08,630
it's not impossible.

3609
01:39:08,660 --> 01:39:09,270
That call.

3610
01:39:09,270 --> 01:39:14,270
I mean on the web there's this advertising
is the web and no one wants to talk

3611
01:39:14,541 --> 01:39:15,050
about that.

3612
01:39:15,050 --> 01:39:15,231
You know,

3613
01:39:15,231 --> 01:39:17,690
people want to run ad block and
pretend that it doesn't exist.

3614
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:20,030
Every site you love,

3615
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:21,680
every video you love,

3616
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:26,090
every thing important and interesting
on the web or the or a lot of it,

3617
01:39:26,091 --> 01:39:29,900
the vast majority of it is supported by
the fact that brands are paying to be in

3618
01:39:29,901 --> 01:39:30,734
your face.

3619
01:39:30,860 --> 01:39:33,290
Google exists because they're
an advertising company,

3620
01:39:33,291 --> 01:39:34,170
first and foremost.

3621
01:39:34,171 --> 01:39:35,390
That's how they keep the doors open.

3622
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:39,110
But there's this really
weird thing where people,

3623
01:39:39,230 --> 01:39:39,770
you know,

3624
01:39:39,770 --> 01:39:40,640
hey haters,

3625
01:39:40,641 --> 01:39:41,120
whoever,

3626
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:43,640
people want to come on there and pretend
that it's actually something else

3627
01:39:43,641 --> 01:39:44,720
they're participating in.

3628
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:48,920
But if it wasn't for advertising in
real money finding its way to the web,

3629
01:39:48,921 --> 01:39:50,420
none of us would be here right now.

3630
01:39:50,690 --> 01:39:54,710
You need it to survive and you
needed to invest back in the content.

3631
01:39:54,711 --> 01:39:57,080
I'm out here in La Right
now shooting fucking arrows.

3632
01:39:57,120 --> 01:39:58,190
It's not free.

3633
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:00,680
I get a $10,000 camera back there.

3634
01:40:00,681 --> 01:40:01,341
It's not free.

3635
01:40:01,341 --> 01:40:02,660
If you want to see cool shit,

3636
01:40:02,661 --> 01:40:03,650
it's going to cost you,

3637
01:40:04,070 --> 01:40:06,620
but at least in this environment,

3638
01:40:06,621 --> 01:40:11,060
you know it's spent on the actual thing
and not spent on some woman walking

3639
01:40:11,061 --> 01:40:11,930
around with a clipboard.

3640
01:40:12,210 --> 01:40:12,990
Right.

3641
01:40:12,990 --> 01:40:13,620
Well,

3642
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:16,980
I've been to certain youtube
shows that are super overproduced.

3643
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:17,280
Yeah.

3644
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:19,850
Have you ever seen youtube shows where
they do it like a Hollywood show where

3645
01:40:19,851 --> 01:40:24,450
they have makeup artists
and producers and directors?

3646
01:40:24,700 --> 01:40:25,051
There's a,

3647
01:40:25,051 --> 01:40:28,410
there's a guy that's holding the camera
and there's another guy directing it and

3648
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:29,850
someone who's overviewing the thing.

3649
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:30,931
I've seen like six,

3650
01:40:30,931 --> 01:40:32,700
seven people and I've
been on the same sets,

3651
01:40:32,701 --> 01:40:33,510
man.

3652
01:40:33,510 --> 01:40:34,350
And what is that?

3653
01:40:34,470 --> 01:40:36,390
That's the blockbuster effect.

3654
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:40,650
Those are the traditional people
taking the easiest path to secure their

3655
01:40:40,651 --> 01:40:42,600
position without being imaginative.

3656
01:40:42,910 --> 01:40:46,390
It's also people that think that you
have to do that in order to be legit,

3657
01:40:46,570 --> 01:40:47,920
you have to have all those roles.

3658
01:40:47,950 --> 01:40:48,301
That's right.

3659
01:40:48,301 --> 01:40:48,760
Tray.

3660
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:48,911
If,

3661
01:40:48,911 --> 01:40:49,051
yeah,

3662
01:40:49,051 --> 01:40:51,140
if there's not a tip.

3663
01:40:51,190 --> 01:40:54,190
Today we had probably five people

3664
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:55,060
holding cameras,

3665
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:55,990
you know what I mean?

3666
01:40:55,990 --> 01:40:56,580
Not everybody,

3667
01:40:56,580 --> 01:40:58,210
not because it was their job,

3668
01:40:58,211 --> 01:41:01,330
but because it was exciting to try and
get an interesting frame themselves.

3669
01:41:01,670 --> 01:41:02,170
You know,

3670
01:41:02,170 --> 01:41:07,000
we wasted everybody on the actual
subject matter instead of having somebody

3671
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:08,680
putting powder on our faces.

3672
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:09,910
And there was also,

3673
01:41:09,911 --> 01:41:10,671
there wasn't the,

3674
01:41:10,671 --> 01:41:10,841
the,

3675
01:41:10,841 --> 01:41:12,520
the voice of reason didn't exist.

3676
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:13,130
No.

3677
01:41:13,130 --> 01:41:15,200
There was no one person that would know.

3678
01:41:15,270 --> 01:41:15,761
Let's say,

3679
01:41:15,761 --> 01:41:16,071
look,

3680
01:41:16,071 --> 01:41:16,181
look,

3681
01:41:16,181 --> 01:41:16,870
we can't do that.

3682
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:17,703
That's too far.

3683
01:41:17,710 --> 01:41:19,060
I going to lose our sponsors.

3684
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:19,630
We're going to,

3685
01:41:19,630 --> 01:41:20,291
exactly.

3686
01:41:20,291 --> 01:41:22,390
I think once you've had the real version,

3687
01:41:22,450 --> 01:41:24,040
once you had the uncensored version,

3688
01:41:24,041 --> 01:41:27,190
once you've had you on the podcast
of you've had me and my show,

3689
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:30,100
it's really hard to ingest
us in another format,

3690
01:41:30,130 --> 01:41:30,700
you know?

3691
01:41:30,700 --> 01:41:31,450
Yeah.

3692
01:41:31,450 --> 01:41:32,620
Well it'd be really hard.

3693
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:35,470
It'd be really hard to recreate that,

3694
01:41:35,471 --> 01:41:39,160
to like to recreate someone who's really
interested in what they're talking

3695
01:41:39,161 --> 01:41:39,310
about.

3696
01:41:39,310 --> 01:41:40,143
Really passionate about.

3697
01:41:40,180 --> 01:41:40,540
It's,

3698
01:41:40,540 --> 01:41:41,890
I don't think you can recreate it.

3699
01:41:42,130 --> 01:41:43,690
You either into it or you're not.

3700
01:41:43,730 --> 01:41:44,170
Yeah.

3701
01:41:44,170 --> 01:41:45,100
You can't fake that.

3702
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:46,113
It comes through,

3703
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:46,661
you know,

3704
01:41:46,661 --> 01:41:48,820
that's a big issue in
mixed martial arts too.

3705
01:41:48,850 --> 01:41:49,670
And big image,

3706
01:41:49,670 --> 01:41:50,503
mixed martial arts.

3707
01:41:50,580 --> 01:41:51,070
Um,

3708
01:41:51,070 --> 01:41:51,490
they,

3709
01:41:51,490 --> 01:41:56,470
there was a bunch of those sort of sports
guys that got into mixed martial arts

3710
01:41:56,471 --> 01:41:57,880
and we're doing commentary on it,

3711
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,930
but really didn't know what
the fuck you're talking about.

3712
01:42:00,070 --> 01:42:02,500
But they were more sports and they
would say like ridiculous shit.

3713
01:42:02,501 --> 01:42:05,170
And the hardcore fans would go crazy.

3714
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:06,670
They go after them,

3715
01:42:07,060 --> 01:42:07,421
they're like,

3716
01:42:07,421 --> 01:42:08,980
you're not really a fan.

3717
01:42:08,981 --> 01:42:12,610
You flip out weird faker guy who doesn't
even understand what you're talking

3718
01:42:12,611 --> 01:42:13,180
about.

3719
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:15,190
And it just shone through.

3720
01:42:15,370 --> 01:42:18,760
And then there's other guys that do
it that they big clearly love it.

3721
01:42:18,761 --> 01:42:20,650
And those are the ones
that are usually embraced.

3722
01:42:20,710 --> 01:42:21,543
For the most part.

3723
01:42:21,670 --> 01:42:26,590
The only problem from a business
perspective is when the guy,

3724
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:31,810
if the guy you're employing knows more
about the thing than you do who's really

3725
01:42:31,811 --> 01:42:32,770
in the power position,

3726
01:42:32,860 --> 01:42:33,693
uh,

3727
01:42:33,980 --> 01:42:37,990
you see there's something really
enticing about putting a puppet in.

3728
01:42:38,490 --> 01:42:39,130
It's true.

3729
01:42:39,130 --> 01:42:39,521
Yeah.

3730
01:42:39,521 --> 01:42:43,410
And or putting an expert in who
will do your bidding or putting,

3731
01:42:43,810 --> 01:42:44,261
putting it to,

3732
01:42:44,261 --> 01:42:44,561
yeah,

3733
01:42:44,561 --> 01:42:45,161
exactly.

3734
01:42:45,161 --> 01:42:47,050
An expert the way you see it,

3735
01:42:47,170 --> 01:42:49,170
a well compensated experts and those,

3736
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:52,120
that'd be a company man and expert actor.

3737
01:42:52,450 --> 01:42:52,901
Yeah.

3738
01:42:52,901 --> 01:42:54,940
And then when it comes to
electronics and things,

3739
01:42:54,941 --> 01:42:58,060
that's when it gets really squirrely
because if Sony knows that you've been

3740
01:42:58,061 --> 01:43:01,900
beholding to LG and they try to
lure you from the LG side and then,

3741
01:43:02,190 --> 01:43:04,090
and then LG finds out that you,

3742
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:05,560
well you fucking went over to Sony.

3743
01:43:05,561 --> 01:43:06,380
Hi Goddamn.

3744
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:08,400
Turncoat like you,

3745
01:43:08,410 --> 01:43:10,720
you've relationships and
the whole fucking thing.

3746
01:43:10,721 --> 01:43:11,200
Yeah.

3747
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:11,950
How does that work?

3748
01:43:11,950 --> 01:43:14,980
Like when you get stuff
like I know top gear.

3749
01:43:15,130 --> 01:43:15,371
Okay.

3750
01:43:15,371 --> 01:43:17,350
You know that show top gear
from the baby seat in the show.

3751
01:43:17,351 --> 01:43:18,184
Great show,

3752
01:43:18,190 --> 01:43:18,611
great show.

3753
01:43:18,611 --> 01:43:21,340
Well they had a problem with American,

3754
01:43:21,550 --> 01:43:22,180
uh,

3755
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:26,530
would do it on doing it in America
because they shit on some cars.

3756
01:43:26,830 --> 01:43:27,580
I mean they,

3757
01:43:27,580 --> 01:43:30,630
Jeremy Clarkson takes
open dumps on some cars.

3758
01:43:30,631 --> 01:43:35,170
Emily Porsha's like for years
and years until like the nine,

3759
01:43:35,171 --> 01:43:35,561
nine,

3760
01:43:35,561 --> 01:43:38,140
seven turbo was the
first Porsche he praised.

3761
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:39,730
He would shit on them.

3762
01:43:39,731 --> 01:43:41,170
How stupid they were.

3763
01:43:41,171 --> 01:43:44,080
And they were basically
overgrown Beatles and like,

3764
01:43:44,380 --> 01:43:44,711
I mean,

3765
01:43:44,711 --> 01:43:45,850
it would constantly do that.

3766
01:43:45,851 --> 01:43:46,960
And because of that,

3767
01:43:46,961 --> 01:43:50,260
like a lot of American car companies
didn't want to donate their cars to them

3768
01:43:50,380 --> 01:43:52,070
and they had a real issue doing

3769
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:53,930
that show on American TV.

3770
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:57,820
We kind of dipped into that in the last
conversation about how when your subject

3771
01:43:57,821 --> 01:43:59,890
matter comes from a company,

3772
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:01,280
like if you,

3773
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:01,721
you know,

3774
01:44:01,721 --> 01:44:04,150
when you want to go shoot a Romcom movie,

3775
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:07,090
the subject matters that are
the actors that you hire.

3776
01:44:07,540 --> 01:44:08,560
But in this case,

3777
01:44:08,740 --> 01:44:09,071
this,

3778
01:44:09,071 --> 01:44:10,030
these are actors,

3779
01:44:10,031 --> 01:44:10,600
these are the,

3780
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:12,790
this is what makes the
video or breaks the video.

3781
01:44:13,090 --> 01:44:13,301
I mean,

3782
01:44:13,301 --> 01:44:15,700
I can sit there and talk about
what I've heard all I want,

3783
01:44:15,701 --> 01:44:17,140
but without it in my hands,

3784
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:20,230
I have no interpretation
to share with you.

3785
01:44:20,890 --> 01:44:25,660
So it's a very big deal maintaining
these relationships and making sure that

3786
01:44:25,661 --> 01:44:29,680
you're going to get your hands on this
stuff and therefore it is important what

3787
01:44:29,681 --> 01:44:31,120
people say and how they say it.

3788
01:44:31,750 --> 01:44:32,890
And so this is,

3789
01:44:32,950 --> 01:44:37,930
I was ranting last show on tech journalism
and somebody had a really good point

3790
01:44:37,931 --> 01:44:40,180
in the youtube comments
about journalism in general.

3791
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:40,541
They're like,

3792
01:44:40,541 --> 01:44:41,080
wait a minute,

3793
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:42,040
think about politics.

3794
01:44:42,041 --> 01:44:43,650
Think about commercials on CNN.

3795
01:44:43,651 --> 01:44:47,650
I think about the agenda of anybody
trying to get a message out there.

3796
01:44:47,651 --> 01:44:51,430
If you can shrouded under
the heading of journalism,

3797
01:44:51,730 --> 01:44:54,910
it's going to get past the
filtration system that much easier.

3798
01:44:55,210 --> 01:44:55,481
See,

3799
01:44:55,481 --> 01:44:57,190
it's the best advertising,

3800
01:44:57,220 --> 01:44:58,690
real advertising stuff.

3801
01:44:58,691 --> 01:44:59,770
You don't even know it's there.

3802
01:45:02,050 --> 01:45:04,110
I like we just said product placement.

3803
01:45:04,140 --> 01:45:06,270
I remember when I first found
out about product placement,

3804
01:45:06,570 --> 01:45:08,220
I think it was on news radio,

3805
01:45:08,490 --> 01:45:08,941
they would,

3806
01:45:08,941 --> 01:45:09,121
uh,

3807
01:45:09,121 --> 01:45:09,601
there's two,

3808
01:45:09,601 --> 01:45:13,200
there's different types of
product placement and one
there's free product that

3809
01:45:13,201 --> 01:45:15,120
they just give you free
product and so you,

3810
01:45:15,150 --> 01:45:18,330
you drink their sodas on the
set and you wear their clothes.

3811
01:45:18,331 --> 01:45:21,330
Like Nike will give you free sneakers
if you're on a television show,

3812
01:45:21,570 --> 01:45:22,700
like things along those lines.

3813
01:45:22,770 --> 01:45:23,910
There's that kind.

3814
01:45:24,180 --> 01:45:29,160
And then there's also like where you
are supposed to be holding up a cocacola

3815
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:30,550
while you're in the like,

3816
01:45:30,930 --> 01:45:31,261
man,

3817
01:45:31,261 --> 01:45:33,750
we've got to find this fucking
killer before he kills again.

3818
01:45:36,530 --> 01:45:38,610
It's refreshing.

3819
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:39,710
It's really helped me fight crime.

3820
01:45:40,030 --> 01:45:40,320
You know,

3821
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:41,290
that's like the low,

3822
01:45:41,291 --> 01:45:42,730
the low five version.

3823
01:45:42,850 --> 01:45:43,151
That's,

3824
01:45:43,151 --> 01:45:45,210
that's like the
unsophisticated version of it.

3825
01:45:45,460 --> 01:45:50,170
But then on sophisticated version
rears its ugly head pretty often.

3826
01:45:50,171 --> 01:45:51,220
Sometimes offensively.

3827
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:51,550
Yeah,

3828
01:45:51,550 --> 01:45:52,810
on cable TV and the Internet.

3829
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:53,080
Yeah.

3830
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:54,500
The end of that we'll react to internet.

3831
01:45:54,530 --> 01:45:56,910
One problem with that shit
product place when you fuckhead

3832
01:45:57,090 --> 01:45:58,120
Internet won't put up with Shit and,

3833
01:45:58,130 --> 01:46:01,670
and ultimately I don't think
it functions in nearly as well.

3834
01:46:02,030 --> 01:46:02,863
I,

3835
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:03,973
here's the thing,

3836
01:46:04,430 --> 01:46:06,770
I always get pissed off when I'm
watching a movie or something and they've

3837
01:46:06,771 --> 01:46:10,970
completely covered up the
logos on everything because
watching that movie for me

3838
01:46:10,971 --> 01:46:12,800
is all about the suspension of disbelief.

3839
01:46:13,250 --> 01:46:16,310
I have to believe that what
I'm looking at is potentially

3840
01:46:16,370 --> 01:46:16,970
possible,

3841
01:46:16,970 --> 01:46:21,080
like if it's an apple laptop of the apple
part is blurred out every reality show

3842
01:46:21,081 --> 01:46:21,560
ever.

3843
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:26,210
Is that as bad as when it's a Sony
show and everyone's got a Sony?

3844
01:46:26,330 --> 01:46:29,510
I was watching a movie a
day where everyone had Sony,

3845
01:46:30,230 --> 01:46:30,681
Sony,

3846
01:46:30,681 --> 01:46:32,090
Vaio laptops

3847
01:46:32,470 --> 01:46:32,711
right now,

3848
01:46:32,711 --> 01:46:33,610
his music videos,

3849
01:46:33,770 --> 01:46:34,280
music videos.

3850
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:35,620
It's no longer a viable business.

3851
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:37,560
The investing that much money in a video,

3852
01:46:37,561 --> 01:46:39,700
then all you're going to get is a
little bit of ad revenue on Youtube,

3853
01:46:40,180 --> 01:46:43,330
so they're all supported
heavily by private placement.

3854
01:46:43,331 --> 01:46:44,380
You'll see beats audio,

3855
01:46:44,381 --> 01:46:49,381
you'll see special phones and
like super heavy in the frame.

3856
01:46:49,861 --> 01:46:50,694
You know,

3857
01:46:50,970 --> 01:46:51,803
for me,

3858
01:46:52,290 --> 01:46:54,900
if we can all agree that the
audiences themselves is becoming more

3859
01:46:54,901 --> 01:46:55,734
sophisticated,

3860
01:46:55,860 --> 01:46:59,460
we need to get better at hiding the
Easter eggs in our entertainment because

3861
01:46:59,461 --> 01:47:01,410
you're going to fuck up my
suspension of disbelief.

3862
01:47:01,710 --> 01:47:02,310
Yeah.

3863
01:47:02,310 --> 01:47:03,270
Using them.

3864
01:47:03,271 --> 01:47:04,560
So blatantly obvious.

3865
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:05,130
Like I,

3866
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:07,650
like I said with this
movie I saw the other day,

3867
01:47:07,710 --> 01:47:11,130
the every time they took a
photograph it was a Sony Camera.

3868
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:11,993
Every time.

3869
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:13,290
What fucking movie was it?

3870
01:47:13,291 --> 01:47:14,124
God dammit.

3871
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:14,461
Yeah,

3872
01:47:14,461 --> 01:47:15,900
you need to call this out right now.

3873
01:47:15,930 --> 01:47:16,111
Yeah.

3874
01:47:16,111 --> 01:47:17,850
I'm trying to remember what movie it is.

3875
01:47:17,970 --> 01:47:18,960
I just saw it.

3876
01:47:19,290 --> 01:47:19,531
Yeah.

3877
01:47:19,531 --> 01:47:24,390
Well here's the problem with the blatant
call out is that all of a sudden as a

3878
01:47:24,391 --> 01:47:26,880
consumer your guard is up re,

3879
01:47:26,970 --> 01:47:27,271
right.

3880
01:47:27,271 --> 01:47:32,130
We are bombarded with brand messages on
a daily basis and till because of it we

3881
01:47:32,131 --> 01:47:34,140
build up this force field.

3882
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:35,060
Right.

3883
01:47:35,060 --> 01:47:35,460
That,

3884
01:47:35,460 --> 01:47:35,821
I don't know.

3885
01:47:35,821 --> 01:47:36,720
I don't remember what the figure is.

3886
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:39,870
You're inundated with thousands of brand
messages before you even get to work in

3887
01:47:39,871 --> 01:47:40,800
the morning type thing.

3888
01:47:40,900 --> 01:47:41,733
Yeah.

3889
01:47:41,790 --> 01:47:45,650
And so your guard is up and so it doesn't
pass into that other portion of that

3890
01:47:45,670 --> 01:47:48,510
subconscious portion of your mind that
controls your purchasing decisions.

3891
01:47:48,690 --> 01:47:52,350
So not only are you fucking up my
entertainment by not allowing for the

3892
01:47:52,351 --> 01:47:53,370
suspension of disbelief,

3893
01:47:53,371 --> 01:47:53,940
but you're not also,

3894
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:56,880
you're also not selling me your product
because I saw what you did there.

3895
01:47:57,060 --> 01:47:57,750
Right?

3896
01:47:57,750 --> 01:47:58,201
Yeah.

3897
01:47:58,201 --> 01:47:59,310
And if I do buy it,

3898
01:47:59,370 --> 01:48:03,570
like I'm buying it in spite of what you
did because exactly like it's so good.

3899
01:48:03,571 --> 01:48:04,410
I'll buy it anyway.

3900
01:48:04,411 --> 01:48:04,951
But God,

3901
01:48:04,951 --> 01:48:05,460
you idiots.

3902
01:48:05,460 --> 01:48:05,641
Oh,

3903
01:48:05,641 --> 01:48:07,140
deliver us from evil.

3904
01:48:07,770 --> 01:48:08,700
That's what it was.

3905
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:09,593
What's it about?

3906
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:10,201
Oh,

3907
01:48:10,201 --> 01:48:12,210
it's a silly fucking movie.

3908
01:48:12,350 --> 01:48:13,380
It's supposedly,

3909
01:48:13,381 --> 01:48:14,970
it's Eric Bana movie.

3910
01:48:15,330 --> 01:48:16,980
It's based on um,

3911
01:48:17,030 --> 01:48:17,310
uh,

3912
01:48:17,310 --> 01:48:22,030
the real life instances off a
New York City police to duck

3913
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:26,100
serious thing where a guy was possessed.

3914
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:26,251
Like,

3915
01:48:26,251 --> 01:48:27,390
get the fuck out of here.

3916
01:48:27,391 --> 01:48:28,440
It's so ridiculous.

3917
01:48:28,441 --> 01:48:28,920
So,

3918
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:29,161
but,

3919
01:48:29,161 --> 01:48:30,480
and that had product placement.

3920
01:48:30,481 --> 01:48:31,080
It's interesting.

3921
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:33,630
Really blatantly obvious
product placement.

3922
01:48:34,250 --> 01:48:35,130
It was pretty silly.

3923
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:35,490
Yeah.

3924
01:48:35,490 --> 01:48:36,151
Like so much.

3925
01:48:36,151 --> 01:48:40,980
So like every time they use the phone
you got to see the Sony logo clearly in

3926
01:48:40,981 --> 01:48:41,491
place.

3927
01:48:41,491 --> 01:48:44,310
And that's see brands themselves,

3928
01:48:44,311 --> 01:48:48,090
the people making those calls to the
wrong fucking people did the wrong people

3929
01:48:48,330 --> 01:48:50,370
that there's just some meeting
somewhere in there going,

3930
01:48:50,371 --> 01:48:50,551
okay,

3931
01:48:50,551 --> 01:48:52,770
we can have the phone in for
three frames or eight frames.

3932
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:57,750
We'll take eight frames because we
want as much of these as we can get.

3933
01:48:57,890 --> 01:48:58,051
Well,

3934
01:48:58,051 --> 01:48:59,550
it's not a question of quantity.

3935
01:48:59,730 --> 01:49:00,360
It's not,

3936
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:02,100
you just got to plant the seed man.

3937
01:49:02,370 --> 01:49:02,551
Well,

3938
01:49:02,551 --> 01:49:05,160
if you're teaching them
how to be fuckheads,

3939
01:49:05,490 --> 01:49:06,323
I don't think you should,

3940
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:09,270
but I don't think that's fuckhead
at all because my life experience,

3941
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:10,320
I don't care about average.

3942
01:49:10,350 --> 01:49:11,183
Like I,

3943
01:49:11,250 --> 01:49:15,030
I personally think good advertising is
one of the most sophisticated art forms

3944
01:49:15,031 --> 01:49:15,660
that exists,

3945
01:49:15,660 --> 01:49:16,110
right?

3946
01:49:16,110 --> 01:49:18,420
I have enormous respect
for good advertising.

3947
01:49:18,810 --> 01:49:20,640
The problem with advertising it,

3948
01:49:20,750 --> 01:49:21,750
it's context.

3949
01:49:21,930 --> 01:49:22,860
Like for example,

3950
01:49:23,180 --> 01:49:23,520
uh,

3951
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:23,971
women,

3952
01:49:23,971 --> 01:49:25,020
they are going to read vogue,

3953
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:25,831
Vogue magazine,

3954
01:49:25,831 --> 01:49:26,664
right?

3955
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:30,510
Vogue magazine is as much about the people
they choose to let advertise in there

3956
01:49:30,511 --> 01:49:32,610
as it is about anything
they write on their own.

3957
01:49:33,030 --> 01:49:34,650
It's all about context,

3958
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,570
the experience of picking it up,

3959
01:49:36,571 --> 01:49:37,590
going through the pages,

3960
01:49:37,591 --> 01:49:39,780
finding things that are attractive
and will pulling you in.

3961
01:49:39,781 --> 01:49:43,230
And knowing that for
three or $4 you are now,

3962
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:44,453
you are now,

3963
01:49:44,670 --> 01:49:45,503
uh,

3964
01:49:45,730 --> 01:49:46,080
uh,

3965
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:48,070
completely consumed in

3966
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:52,690
the culture of all this really expensive
stuff in these really expensive brands

3967
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:54,100
and it's all connected.

3968
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:55,420
See their narrative.

3969
01:49:55,510 --> 01:49:59,140
The narrative on Vogue magazine is not
about what they're putting into it.

3970
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:01,300
It's about who else is there,

3971
01:50:01,301 --> 01:50:02,320
who's at the party,

3972
01:50:02,710 --> 01:50:04,660
Gucci's their Louis Vuitton is there,

3973
01:50:04,661 --> 01:50:05,350
et cetera.

3974
01:50:05,350 --> 01:50:07,600
It's about building that entire thing up

3975
01:50:07,790 --> 01:50:09,230
and for the male perspective,

3976
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:11,150
dupont registry even better example,

3977
01:50:11,270 --> 01:50:13,610
perfect registry is an ad book.

3978
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:13,961
That's right.

3979
01:50:13,961 --> 01:50:15,110
You're buying an ad book.

3980
01:50:15,140 --> 01:50:19,370
Everything in that magazine
is an advertisement and
we liked everything and we

3981
01:50:19,371 --> 01:50:22,340
love it and it's there at
every fucking newsstand.

3982
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:25,220
You see a dupont registry
and it's got some new car on.

3983
01:50:25,221 --> 01:50:29,490
That's costs way too much
fucking money for 99.99,

3984
01:50:29,510 --> 01:50:31,910
9% of the people that ever
buy that magazine to afford.

3985
01:50:31,970 --> 01:50:32,270
That's right.

3986
01:50:32,270 --> 01:50:33,140
Probably more than that.

3987
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:38,320
Like the Bugatti Veyron 1,000,005 and
it's on the cover and you'll like what?

3988
01:50:38,690 --> 01:50:43,310
Who's his magazine for ad for a car that
costs more than most people's fucking

3989
01:50:43,311 --> 01:50:43,880
houses.

3990
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:45,170
What else is the Robb report?

3991
01:50:45,260 --> 01:50:45,561
Yes.

3992
01:50:45,561 --> 01:50:46,240
That's another one.

3993
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:46,340
Yeah.

3994
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:47,900
All the Robb report is everything though.

3995
01:50:47,901 --> 01:50:49,910
It's like boats and planes.

3996
01:50:49,911 --> 01:50:53,540
If vacation homes in Hawaii
and all this crazy shit,

3997
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:54,500
but that's the thing.

3998
01:50:54,501 --> 01:50:55,260
It's like

3999
01:50:55,260 --> 01:50:58,410
ultimately people want
to be told what to get,

4000
01:50:58,530 --> 01:50:58,741
you know,

4001
01:50:58,741 --> 01:51:00,090
we don't have the time.

4002
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:02,580
It's the reason that
channels like mine exist.

4003
01:51:02,610 --> 01:51:04,300
You don't have the,

4004
01:51:04,860 --> 01:51:05,820
there are so many,

4005
01:51:05,821 --> 01:51:06,471
the products,

4006
01:51:06,471 --> 01:51:10,800
fear is so huge now that keeping tabs
on all of it is very difficult to do.

4007
01:51:10,801 --> 01:51:15,801
And in some ways we're reverting back
to the informational type of advertising

4008
01:51:16,711 --> 01:51:18,480
that existed in previous times.

4009
01:51:18,481 --> 01:51:18,631
You know,

4010
01:51:18,631 --> 01:51:21,180
you break the show and the
guy comes out and he goes,

4011
01:51:21,181 --> 01:51:21,630
I'm,

4012
01:51:21,630 --> 01:51:25,620
I got the new Colgate toothpaste and
the host of the show is actually showing

4013
01:51:25,621 --> 01:51:27,000
you what it is and what it does.

4014
01:51:27,540 --> 01:51:31,230
Seats advertising has moved so
far in the abstract direction,

4015
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:31,741
right?

4016
01:51:31,741 --> 01:51:33,330
Where it's like you're
advertising for beer,

4017
01:51:33,331 --> 01:51:34,980
but everyone's partying
all the fucking time.

4018
01:51:34,981 --> 01:51:35,161
It's like,

4019
01:51:35,161 --> 01:51:35,994
what am I buying?

4020
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:36,610
You know,

4021
01:51:36,610 --> 01:51:37,320
in a party.

4022
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:38,820
I'm buying a party in a bottle

4023
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:39,591
right by a,

4024
01:51:39,591 --> 01:51:40,920
I'm hanging out with these guys that Lou,

4025
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:42,460
their dream come true.

4026
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:46,900
The problem is beer is not representative
of the massive sphere that we have to

4027
01:51:46,901 --> 01:51:47,531
purchase within.

4028
01:51:47,531 --> 01:51:49,210
We needed by complicated shit too.

4029
01:51:49,450 --> 01:51:49,900
Right.

4030
01:51:49,900 --> 01:51:51,460
And you can't just tell
me my life's better

4031
01:51:51,550 --> 01:51:52,383
cause I have it.

4032
01:51:52,460 --> 01:51:53,121
Well I need,

4033
01:51:53,121 --> 01:51:54,020
I need evidence,

4034
01:51:54,021 --> 01:51:54,560
man.

4035
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:56,420
That's the place where you come in.

4036
01:51:56,870 --> 01:51:57,920
And then Marcus,

4037
01:51:58,540 --> 01:51:59,180
um,

4038
01:51:59,180 --> 01:52:00,170
anybody who,

4039
01:52:00,350 --> 01:52:00,801
that's what he said,

4040
01:52:00,801 --> 01:52:01,050
his name,

4041
01:52:01,050 --> 01:52:01,700
Marquez,

4042
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:02,110
Marquez,

4043
01:52:02,110 --> 01:52:03,100
I say Marquez.

4044
01:52:03,130 --> 01:52:08,020
He wound doesn't care if he's Marcus or
Marquez M or F if we want to shout out

4045
01:52:08,021 --> 01:52:08,451
his channel,

4046
01:52:08,451 --> 01:52:09,610
it's Mkbhd

4047
01:52:09,830 --> 01:52:10,641
awesome reviews.

4048
01:52:10,641 --> 01:52:11,000
Yeah.

4049
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:11,720
Awesome reviews.

4050
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:12,521
But the,

4051
01:52:12,521 --> 01:52:16,070
the kind of in depth
coverage of electronics does,

4052
01:52:16,071 --> 01:52:20,330
did not exist even on like
the screen savers even on,

4053
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:21,260
they just couldn't,

4054
01:52:21,320 --> 01:52:22,470
there's no way you can,

4055
01:52:22,580 --> 01:52:23,980
and no one has that time.

4056
01:52:24,770 --> 01:52:25,221
And it's,

4057
01:52:25,221 --> 01:52:28,700
it highlights the issues that
people have with traditional media.

4058
01:52:28,730 --> 01:52:28,971
You know,

4059
01:52:28,971 --> 01:52:33,710
it highlights the issues that people have
with having a very specific time where

4060
01:52:33,711 --> 01:52:34,720
you have to tune into something.

4061
01:52:34,770 --> 01:52:36,140
It's true that that was it.

4062
01:52:36,150 --> 01:52:38,150
That's a huge barrier to creativity.

4063
01:52:38,240 --> 01:52:38,451
Oh,

4064
01:52:38,451 --> 01:52:39,284
it's a man,

4065
01:52:39,340 --> 01:52:44,340
you have to build this messaging that's
suitable for this huge amount of people

4066
01:52:44,990 --> 01:52:46,010
at one time.

4067
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:47,660
Like you know the Superbowl,

4068
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:47,991
right?

4069
01:52:47,991 --> 01:52:51,170
You spend $1 million for
commercial because everybody's
paying attention at that

4070
01:52:51,171 --> 01:52:52,004
time.

4071
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:53,540
But it's not targeted at all.

4072
01:52:53,560 --> 01:52:53,870
Right.

4073
01:52:53,870 --> 01:52:56,210
You're not reaching anybody specifically.

4074
01:52:56,211 --> 01:52:56,481
I mean,

4075
01:52:56,481 --> 01:52:58,790
maybe more dudes are watching
it than women though.

4076
01:52:58,791 --> 01:53:02,690
I was amazed that the female figures is
a lot of women watching it to everyone

4077
01:53:02,691 --> 01:53:03,650
in the house is watching it,

4078
01:53:03,830 --> 01:53:08,830
but ultimately is part of it is the
shotgun approach PR part of it is just

4079
01:53:09,231 --> 01:53:12,740
getting the name of your God damned
thing to as many people as possible.

4080
01:53:12,980 --> 01:53:15,700
But I think real decision
making happens at a,

4081
01:53:15,890 --> 01:53:17,120
at a much deeper level.

4082
01:53:17,510 --> 01:53:17,961
Personally,

4083
01:53:17,961 --> 01:53:18,681
that's my feeling.

4084
01:53:18,681 --> 01:53:21,110
So awareness is point a,

4085
01:53:21,530 --> 01:53:22,670
but uh,

4086
01:53:23,050 --> 01:53:23,770
uh,

4087
01:53:23,770 --> 01:53:24,680
knowledge is,

4088
01:53:24,770 --> 01:53:25,820
is the next step.

4089
01:53:26,030 --> 01:53:27,110
So fine.

4090
01:53:27,111 --> 01:53:29,330
Make your introduction at the super bowl,

4091
01:53:29,510 --> 01:53:30,321
but that's not enough.

4092
01:53:30,321 --> 01:53:31,220
You can't stop there.

4093
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:31,791
Yeah.

4094
01:53:31,791 --> 01:53:36,200
And I think that also the kind of
advertised like the difference between

4095
01:53:36,201 --> 01:53:39,020
advertising and informative

4096
01:53:40,610 --> 01:53:41,390
entertainment,

4097
01:53:41,390 --> 01:53:42,590
which is essentially what you're doing.

4098
01:53:42,590 --> 01:53:43,070
I mean you,

4099
01:53:43,070 --> 01:53:43,311
when,

4100
01:53:43,311 --> 01:53:44,540
when you're doing what I'm doing.

4101
01:53:44,541 --> 01:53:44,701
Yeah.

4102
01:53:44,701 --> 01:53:45,050
But,

4103
01:53:45,050 --> 01:53:47,120
but brands are trying to do what I do now.

4104
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:50,120
Like Samsung will do
their own unboxing videos.

4105
01:53:50,750 --> 01:53:51,470
Really?

4106
01:53:51,470 --> 01:53:52,303
Hell yes.

4107
01:53:52,340 --> 01:53:53,480
And who does it for them?

4108
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:56,060
Some random employee.

4109
01:53:56,100 --> 01:53:56,933
Rob's,

4110
01:53:57,800 --> 01:53:58,490
yeah.

4111
01:53:58,490 --> 01:53:59,330
No seriously.

4112
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:00,040
What is,

4113
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:03,120
so it's not major mindblowing.

4114
01:54:03,180 --> 01:54:03,560
Look,

4115
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:05,480
look one up later look up to,

4116
01:54:05,570 --> 01:54:07,940
I believe it was the s
five or the note three.

4117
01:54:08,370 --> 01:54:10,560
A Korean girl did it for them.

4118
01:54:10,610 --> 01:54:11,443
You're not good.

4119
01:54:12,030 --> 01:54:12,800
Not a good job.

4120
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:14,390
It's the whole thing off piece.

4121
01:54:14,420 --> 01:54:16,850
It feels the whole thing feels so bizarre.

4122
01:54:17,270 --> 01:54:17,780
Again,

4123
01:54:17,780 --> 01:54:18,201
again,

4124
01:54:18,201 --> 01:54:19,034
you're hitting that,

4125
01:54:19,580 --> 01:54:20,820
you're hitting that force field,

4126
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:21,890
you're hitting that sensor.

4127
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:23,030
People are alerted,

4128
01:54:23,150 --> 01:54:23,421
you know,

4129
01:54:23,421 --> 01:54:24,254
we're all,

4130
01:54:24,950 --> 01:54:26,150
that's what I love about it.

4131
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:30,640
I love that sophisticated
advertising or something that's a,

4132
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:31,110
that you,

4133
01:54:31,110 --> 01:54:32,390
I don't even know if
it's just advertising,

4134
01:54:32,391 --> 01:54:35,900
but sophisticated content drives
a more sophisticated viewer.

4135
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:36,920
I love that.

4136
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:41,510
That all these people out
there that experience my
content now are going to hold

4137
01:54:41,511 --> 01:54:42,980
everything else up to that standard.

4138
01:54:43,580 --> 01:54:44,330
You see?

4139
01:54:44,330 --> 01:54:44,990
So you can,

4140
01:54:44,990 --> 01:54:48,770
you are literally pushing the entire
marketplace marketplace by not fitting

4141
01:54:48,771 --> 01:54:50,120
within a particular paradigm.

4142
01:54:51,050 --> 01:54:52,050
That's so interesting,

4143
01:54:52,051 --> 01:54:52,341
man.

4144
01:54:52,341 --> 01:54:57,341
And it's also kind of redefining how
we view the information that we get on,

4145
01:54:58,350 --> 01:54:59,510
on each product.

4146
01:54:59,511 --> 01:55:03,170
Like it used to be the only information
that you got about a new Chevy truck was

4147
01:55:03,171 --> 01:55:05,170
either reading about it
in a magazine cause you,

4148
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:06,380
you're so intrigued,

4149
01:55:06,381 --> 01:55:09,770
the pickup a Chevy truck
magazine or you'd get an ad,

4150
01:55:10,070 --> 01:55:11,780
you'd see an ad for a Chevy truck.

4151
01:55:11,781 --> 01:55:15,260
Now you go online and you Chevy truck,

4152
01:55:15,290 --> 01:55:16,520
everyone knows you.

4153
01:55:16,610 --> 01:55:17,443
Everyone does.

4154
01:55:17,540 --> 01:55:18,890
And there's so many reviews.

4155
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:21,920
I've been looking at a new SUV.

4156
01:55:21,950 --> 01:55:22,251
Why?

4157
01:55:22,251 --> 01:55:23,820
My lease is up on my SUV.

4158
01:55:23,821 --> 01:55:26,990
I'm just thinking about something else
to get or a truck or whatever and I'm

4159
01:55:27,050 --> 01:55:30,260
reading all these different
views and you get lost man.

4160
01:55:30,410 --> 01:55:32,750
It's almost an overload
because he'd be like,

4161
01:55:32,751 --> 01:55:34,550
look up the Toyota Land Cruiser.

4162
01:55:34,580 --> 01:55:34,851
Okay.

4163
01:55:34,851 --> 01:55:35,930
The Land Cruiser Binge.

4164
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:37,070
You Binge on cruiser.

4165
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:37,671
He been giant.

4166
01:55:37,671 --> 01:55:38,600
How much time did you spend?

4167
01:55:38,840 --> 01:55:39,560
Lots of hours.

4168
01:55:39,560 --> 01:55:41,570
How much time will you
put into this purchase?

4169
01:55:41,860 --> 01:55:41,990
Uh,

4170
01:55:41,990 --> 01:55:43,070
quite a bit more.

4171
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:43,921
Anything else?

4172
01:55:43,921 --> 01:55:44,720
Because it's my,

4173
01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:45,810
the family vehicle,

4174
01:55:45,930 --> 01:55:46,320
so it's,

4175
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:50,670
I want to make sure they're safe and
they're big and they carry all our shit.

4176
01:55:50,671 --> 01:55:53,780
If we're going around where seats
fold in a million different ways,

4177
01:55:53,790 --> 01:55:55,780
big entertainment thing.

4178
01:55:55,781 --> 01:55:57,870
So that I have a four year
old and a six year old.

4179
01:55:58,140 --> 01:56:01,350
They get their little party on the
back seat and everything's groovy.

4180
01:56:01,351 --> 01:56:02,190
Phone connection,

4181
01:56:02,670 --> 01:56:04,690
all the negativity.

4182
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:05,873
The new one,

4183
01:56:06,390 --> 01:56:07,320
what's the thing called?

4184
01:56:07,321 --> 01:56:08,220
That's carplay.

4185
01:56:08,250 --> 01:56:09,060
Carplay.

4186
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:09,890
What's that?

4187
01:56:09,890 --> 01:56:10,430
Well that's what,

4188
01:56:10,430 --> 01:56:11,263
that's what,

4189
01:56:11,420 --> 01:56:13,730
that's what we sort of had
that conversation about Google.

4190
01:56:13,731 --> 01:56:14,630
They're doing their own version,

4191
01:56:14,631 --> 01:56:15,320
but apple has it.

4192
01:56:15,320 --> 01:56:19,760
They're eaten car in car software
and they have a few automakers,

4193
01:56:19,790 --> 01:56:20,361
automakers,

4194
01:56:20,361 --> 01:56:24,230
they've aligned with to put essentially
an iPhone experience in your dash,

4195
01:56:24,260 --> 01:56:25,820
so you no longer have that dumb unit.

4196
01:56:26,140 --> 01:56:28,810
You know what they're doing
also for a lot of back seats,

4197
01:56:29,050 --> 01:56:31,690
they have this thing
where you lock in an iPad.

4198
01:56:31,960 --> 01:56:32,491
Oh right.

4199
01:56:32,491 --> 01:56:33,640
And just his watch pocket.

4200
01:56:33,641 --> 01:56:34,900
Just paste it right in there.

4201
01:56:34,930 --> 01:56:38,750
The kids watch their IPAD and they also
have games that they can play on it.

4202
01:56:38,751 --> 01:56:41,290
And they also have their
own individual ear jack.

4203
01:56:41,380 --> 01:56:42,213
Oh definitely.

4204
01:56:42,270 --> 01:56:43,091
Or that's awesome.

4205
01:56:43,091 --> 01:56:44,860
Bluetooth within the device.

4206
01:56:45,190 --> 01:56:47,020
So they have wireless headphones.

4207
01:56:47,230 --> 01:56:47,680
You know,

4208
01:56:47,680 --> 01:56:52,000
Mommy and daddy don't have to listen
to the fucking frozen for the hundredth

4209
01:56:52,001 --> 01:56:52,700
time.

4210
01:56:52,700 --> 01:56:53,531
That's thinking about kids,

4211
01:56:53,531 --> 01:56:54,100
man.

4212
01:56:54,100 --> 01:56:54,820
It's cute.

4213
01:56:54,820 --> 01:56:55,631
It's adorable.

4214
01:56:55,631 --> 01:56:56,950
But once they love something,

4215
01:56:56,951 --> 01:57:00,940
they just want to watch it over and
over and over and over and over.

4216
01:57:01,150 --> 01:57:02,260
I went through tangled.

4217
01:57:02,470 --> 01:57:04,630
I went through a period
of watching tangled.

4218
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:06,070
I probably saw it a hundred times,

4219
01:57:06,340 --> 01:57:06,790
probably.

4220
01:57:06,790 --> 01:57:08,530
So that yet.

4221
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:09,220
No,

4222
01:57:09,220 --> 01:57:09,760
no.

4223
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:10,593
Minor American.

4224
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:12,133
Different than yours.

4225
01:57:12,160 --> 01:57:12,721
My kids are different.

4226
01:57:12,721 --> 01:57:13,600
Definitely have different DNA.

4227
01:57:13,660 --> 01:57:14,091
No,

4228
01:57:14,091 --> 01:57:14,924
they're not.

4229
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:15,420
You.

4230
01:57:15,420 --> 01:57:15,870
I know.

4231
01:57:15,870 --> 01:57:16,703
Mine.

4232
01:57:16,830 --> 01:57:18,470
My two year old especially.

4233
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:19,830
You got to remember they had like,

4234
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:21,390
they'd had all the technology,

4235
01:57:21,420 --> 01:57:23,310
all the video games since day one.

4236
01:57:23,370 --> 01:57:24,940
So no Waldorf School for your kid.

4237
01:57:25,690 --> 01:57:26,370
Fuck No.

4238
01:57:26,370 --> 01:57:27,390
Do you know about Waldorf School?

4239
01:57:27,391 --> 01:57:28,450
They make you play with the wooden toys?

4240
01:57:28,451 --> 01:57:29,400
I had a friend who went there.

4241
01:57:29,401 --> 01:57:29,611
Yeah.

4242
01:57:29,611 --> 01:57:30,470
No electronics.

4243
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:30,960
Yeah.

4244
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:31,141
Yeah.

4245
01:57:31,141 --> 01:57:31,530
No,

4246
01:57:31,530 --> 01:57:31,830
no.

4247
01:57:31,830 --> 01:57:32,351
None of that.

4248
01:57:32,351 --> 01:57:33,184
Nice kids.

4249
01:57:34,270 --> 01:57:34,680
Well,

4250
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:35,513
that's subjective.

4251
01:57:35,970 --> 01:57:37,290
Nicest a subjective word,

4252
01:57:37,590 --> 01:57:38,040
right.

4253
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:38,690
I agree.

4254
01:57:38,690 --> 01:57:39,480
Um,

4255
01:57:39,480 --> 01:57:40,110
but no,

4256
01:57:40,110 --> 01:57:40,441
listen,

4257
01:57:40,441 --> 01:57:41,310
I'm immersed in it.

4258
01:57:41,850 --> 01:57:43,470
I want to connect with them.

4259
01:57:43,740 --> 01:57:44,340
How am I,

4260
01:57:44,340 --> 01:57:45,001
in fact,

4261
01:57:45,001 --> 01:57:47,700
will's been in a bunch of my
videos my four year old lately.

4262
01:57:48,100 --> 01:57:48,420
Uh,

4263
01:57:48,420 --> 01:57:52,740
which is amazing because half of the
shit he sees it come in the house,

4264
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:53,831
you know,

4265
01:57:53,831 --> 01:57:54,090
and,

4266
01:57:54,090 --> 01:57:56,580
and he doesn't get to
participate in that part of it.

4267
01:57:56,581 --> 01:57:57,414
So I think I have the,

4268
01:57:57,450 --> 01:57:57,991
in that sense,

4269
01:57:57,991 --> 01:57:58,800
I have the coolest job.

4270
01:57:58,800 --> 01:57:59,730
I get to do shit with him,

4271
01:58:00,330 --> 01:58:00,601
but,

4272
01:58:00,601 --> 01:58:01,434
um,

4273
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:01,961
and most of it,

4274
01:58:01,961 --> 01:58:03,510
and every time it's him driving it,

4275
01:58:03,511 --> 01:58:03,991
not me.

4276
01:58:03,991 --> 01:58:04,711
So for the audience,

4277
01:58:04,711 --> 01:58:06,210
it's like you're
exploiting him or whatever.

4278
01:58:06,510 --> 01:58:08,700
This is him nagging me weeks on end.

4279
01:58:08,730 --> 01:58:09,660
Let's make another video.

4280
01:58:09,810 --> 01:58:10,730
Four years old likes it.

4281
01:58:10,770 --> 01:58:11,603
He loves it.

4282
01:58:11,610 --> 01:58:12,150
He is fun.

4283
01:58:12,150 --> 01:58:12,960
He loves it.

4284
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:16,080
But they're so into this world that,

4285
01:58:16,390 --> 01:58:16,710
uh,

4286
01:58:16,710 --> 01:58:17,910
like youtube for example,

4287
01:58:17,911 --> 01:58:19,560
they give them an iPad.

4288
01:58:19,561 --> 01:58:20,850
They know how to navigate youtube.

4289
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:22,530
And this is the craziest part,

4290
01:58:22,770 --> 01:58:23,041
and I,

4291
01:58:23,041 --> 01:58:24,570
and I've talked about this before as well.

4292
01:58:24,571 --> 01:58:26,910
It's like the consumption
thing that I'm in,

4293
01:58:26,911 --> 01:58:28,140
like the product world,

4294
01:58:28,141 --> 01:58:29,310
the tech world,

4295
01:58:29,430 --> 01:58:33,480
it exists for different spectrums
to like makeup and beauty and kids.

4296
01:58:33,481 --> 01:58:34,120
Shit,

4297
01:58:34,120 --> 01:58:34,530
Ma,

4298
01:58:34,530 --> 01:58:35,670
they research their toys,

4299
01:58:35,671 --> 01:58:36,504
man.

4300
01:58:36,660 --> 01:58:38,400
They researched the stuff they want.

4301
01:58:38,470 --> 01:58:38,910
Yeah.

4302
01:58:38,910 --> 01:58:40,470
So they were watching Plato sets.

4303
01:58:40,530 --> 01:58:42,250
They're watching car sets.

4304
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:43,780
They're watching Lego,

4305
01:58:44,140 --> 01:58:45,160
Lego man.

4306
01:58:45,460 --> 01:58:47,950
So they're getting started
even earlier than me.

4307
01:58:48,070 --> 01:58:48,791
Not only that,

4308
01:58:48,791 --> 01:58:51,240
those toys get reviewed and that's right.

4309
01:58:51,241 --> 01:58:52,750
The star rating system.

4310
01:58:52,751 --> 01:58:53,350
That's right.

4311
01:58:53,350 --> 01:58:56,860
I'll give you go to Amazon and
you look up children's toys,

4312
01:58:56,980 --> 01:59:01,270
you'll see a rating system and comments
at the parents and the children will

4313
01:59:01,271 --> 01:59:04,540
even like tell the parents what
they like or don't like about a toy.

4314
01:59:04,690 --> 01:59:07,060
And the parents talk about
like this failed quality,

4315
01:59:07,630 --> 01:59:08,470
which she used to.

4316
01:59:08,700 --> 01:59:11,500
I used to have to like read
consumer reports or find out,

4317
01:59:11,501 --> 01:59:11,890
right

4318
01:59:11,890 --> 01:59:16,690
if it was even safe or dangerous toys
that broken stabbed you and you felt,

4319
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:17,553
Oh uh,

4320
01:59:17,950 --> 01:59:22,390
the high chairs recall a fucking high
chair cause people are falling over or

4321
01:59:22,391 --> 01:59:23,020
whatever.

4322
01:59:23,020 --> 01:59:24,520
Now all that shit's out in the open.

4323
01:59:24,760 --> 01:59:25,391
It's amazing.

4324
01:59:25,391 --> 01:59:25,661
You see.

4325
01:59:25,661 --> 01:59:26,590
But here's the thing,

4326
01:59:26,591 --> 01:59:27,460
it's like if,

4327
01:59:27,610 --> 01:59:30,100
if the blockbuster guys are
on one end of the spectrum,

4328
01:59:30,310 --> 01:59:31,870
poor fucking blockbuster guys,

4329
01:59:31,871 --> 01:59:33,200
I keep on calling them out,

4330
01:59:33,430 --> 01:59:34,270
they still exist.

4331
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:36,010
Those are real guys that
are listening right now.

4332
01:59:36,250 --> 01:59:37,660
Probably not poor bastards.

4333
01:59:37,661 --> 01:59:38,170
Anyway.

4334
01:59:38,170 --> 01:59:41,800
If the blockbuster guys are on one end
of the spectrum and my kids are on the

4335
01:59:41,801 --> 01:59:46,801
other because I'm already completely
sensitized to the traditional media

4336
01:59:47,201 --> 01:59:47,681
messaging,

4337
01:59:47,681 --> 01:59:49,240
like it's not going to fucking work on me.

4338
01:59:49,420 --> 01:59:51,400
It sure as fuck isn't
going to work on them.

4339
01:59:51,570 --> 01:59:52,210
Yeah,

4340
01:59:52,210 --> 01:59:53,860
they know how to get around it.

4341
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:54,581
Not only that,

4342
01:59:54,581 --> 01:59:55,810
they're from the Joe.

4343
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:56,673
How old are you?

4344
01:59:56,920 --> 01:59:58,840
29 I'm 46 right,

4345
01:59:58,841 --> 02:00:03,010
so obviously I dealt with a lot of
years where there was no influence

4346
02:00:03,011 --> 02:00:03,491
whatsoever.

4347
02:00:03,491 --> 02:00:03,880
Exactly.

4348
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:08,080
By the common person with social media
and the ability to spread information

4349
02:00:08,230 --> 02:00:10,810
like a guy like you didn't
exist when I was young,

4350
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:13,630
my job didn't exist when
I was in high school.

4351
02:00:13,690 --> 02:00:16,120
My guidance counselor couldn't have
told me what the fuck I was going to be

4352
02:00:16,121 --> 02:00:17,440
doing cause youtube wasn't even a thing.

4353
02:00:18,250 --> 02:00:19,570
He probably wouldn't have
told you to do it anymore.

4354
02:00:21,250 --> 02:00:23,260
Guide what guidance
counselors can I tell you,

4355
02:00:23,350 --> 02:00:23,711
hey man,

4356
02:00:23,711 --> 02:00:25,080
you should make some youtube videos.

4357
02:00:25,390 --> 02:00:27,520
I get that question more than
anything else from young people.

4358
02:00:27,521 --> 02:00:28,354
How do I do what you do?

4359
02:00:28,510 --> 02:00:29,450
It's a number one question.

4360
02:00:29,451 --> 02:00:30,820
It just start doing it right.

4361
02:00:30,850 --> 02:00:31,683
That's it.

4362
02:00:31,950 --> 02:00:32,480
I mean,

4363
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:34,450
those people that are
asking that question,

4364
02:00:34,900 --> 02:00:35,560
knuckleheads,

4365
02:00:35,560 --> 02:00:36,450
stop with the questions.

4366
02:00:36,490 --> 02:00:37,420
Just go do something.

4367
02:00:37,810 --> 02:00:38,980
That's the problem with people.

4368
02:00:38,981 --> 02:00:41,380
They like to talk about shit so much.

4369
02:00:41,381 --> 02:00:42,640
They don't actually do shit.

4370
02:00:42,850 --> 02:00:45,160
I've been reading Stephen
King's book on writing,

4371
02:00:45,220 --> 02:00:46,300
which is a great book.

4372
02:00:46,330 --> 02:00:50,890
Or I was reading it this weekend and I'm
one of the great things about the book

4373
02:00:50,891 --> 02:00:51,730
and he says like,

4374
02:00:51,790 --> 02:00:54,730
don't even talk about writing so much.

4375
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:56,020
Like you should just go.

4376
02:00:56,021 --> 02:00:56,450
Right.

4377
02:00:56,450 --> 02:00:57,281
Just get it done.

4378
02:00:57,281 --> 02:00:58,690
Like in a lot of times people,

4379
02:00:58,691 --> 02:01:00,820
and this is also in
Steven Pressfield's book,

4380
02:01:00,821 --> 02:01:01,654
the war of art.

4381
02:01:01,870 --> 02:01:04,750
A lot of times people will distract
themselves from the actual work at hand by

4382
02:01:04,751 --> 02:01:05,584
talking about it.

4383
02:01:05,630 --> 02:01:07,000
Some definitely.

4384
02:01:07,030 --> 02:01:07,680
No,

4385
02:01:07,680 --> 02:01:08,110
I mean,

4386
02:01:08,110 --> 02:01:09,040
I completely feel that way.

4387
02:01:09,041 --> 02:01:09,281
In fact,

4388
02:01:09,281 --> 02:01:10,150
in my studio,

4389
02:01:10,151 --> 02:01:15,151
I tried to create it in such a fashion
where the friction between me starting

4390
02:01:15,251 --> 02:01:16,720
something and not starting something,

4391
02:01:16,721 --> 02:01:17,950
is that the lowest level possible?

4392
02:01:17,951 --> 02:01:18,910
You've done the same thing here,

4393
02:01:18,911 --> 02:01:19,744
obviously.

4394
02:01:20,020 --> 02:01:20,351
I mean,

4395
02:01:20,351 --> 02:01:20,770
Jesus,

4396
02:01:20,770 --> 02:01:22,030
you just sit down and go,

4397
02:01:22,100 --> 02:01:22,380
yeah,

4398
02:01:22,380 --> 02:01:22,600
you know,

4399
02:01:22,600 --> 02:01:23,321
and that's the key.

4400
02:01:23,321 --> 02:01:25,030
Because human beings,

4401
02:01:25,031 --> 02:01:27,460
we will naturally find ways out of doing.

4402
02:01:27,480 --> 02:01:27,691
Yeah,

4403
02:01:27,691 --> 02:01:28,990
we know we're supposed to be doing,

4404
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:30,460
but this is easy to do.

4405
02:01:30,461 --> 02:01:34,250
This is like at all the things
that I do that require me to do it.

4406
02:01:34,290 --> 02:01:35,170
Whether it's writing,

4407
02:01:35,171 --> 02:01:36,130
being the most difficult,

4408
02:01:36,131 --> 02:01:37,780
standup being the least difficult.

4409
02:01:37,990 --> 02:01:42,050
This is the easiest standup being
the least if oh to get me to do.

4410
02:01:42,110 --> 02:01:42,291
Oh,

4411
02:01:42,291 --> 02:01:42,740
okay,

4412
02:01:42,740 --> 02:01:43,920
I got a lot of doing standup.

4413
02:01:43,960 --> 02:01:44,810
It's really fun.

4414
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:45,170
Right.

4415
02:01:45,170 --> 02:01:45,890
You know,

4416
02:01:45,890 --> 02:01:49,280
it's probably the most
difficult to get right.

4417
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:52,280
This is probably the easiest
out of all the things that I do.

4418
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:55,160
I don't know that all things that I do,

4419
02:01:55,870 --> 02:01:57,140
it might be to you,

4420
02:01:57,230 --> 02:01:58,730
but I mean to the average person,

4421
02:01:58,760 --> 02:02:01,220
I think this format is,

4422
02:02:01,250 --> 02:02:06,250
it requires a certain openness
about yourself because to do a set,

4423
02:02:07,910 --> 02:02:08,743
are you re,

4424
02:02:08,870 --> 02:02:13,220
are you revealing as much about yourself
and a comedy set as you are in a three

4425
02:02:13,221 --> 02:02:14,090
hour conversation?

4426
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:16,370
You definitely may reveal more
than a three hour conversation,

4427
02:02:16,371 --> 02:02:16,910
I would think.

4428
02:02:16,910 --> 02:02:18,020
I would think so too.

4429
02:02:18,070 --> 02:02:18,680
You can,

4430
02:02:18,680 --> 02:02:20,810
especially when you do 500 of them.

4431
02:02:20,850 --> 02:02:21,683
That's what I'm saying.

4432
02:02:22,110 --> 02:02:22,370
Yeah,

4433
02:02:22,370 --> 02:02:26,330
that's me get a sense and a lot of people
I know the barrier that's holding them

4434
02:02:26,331 --> 02:02:29,750
back in the first place is insecurity
about who they are or what they have to

4435
02:02:29,751 --> 02:02:31,550
share or whether or not
anyone gives a fuck.

4436
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:32,330
Well,

4437
02:02:32,330 --> 02:02:32,690
it,

4438
02:02:32,690 --> 02:02:36,770
that's a much tougher place to put them
in this seat where they're expected to

4439
02:02:36,771 --> 02:02:41,390
show who they are for three hours
instead of mastering this really perfect

4440
02:02:41,391 --> 02:02:42,740
little box,

4441
02:02:42,741 --> 02:02:44,570
this little thing that represents them.

4442
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:45,500
Right?

4443
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:46,333
Like I think,

4444
02:02:46,630 --> 02:02:47,001
uh,

4445
02:02:47,001 --> 02:02:51,140
I make most of my videos are three to
five minutes long and I think a person

4446
02:02:51,141 --> 02:02:53,900
could listen to this podcast right here
and know more about me than if they

4447
02:02:53,901 --> 02:02:55,460
watched 500 of them.

4448
02:02:55,550 --> 02:02:55,701
Oh,

4449
02:02:55,701 --> 02:02:56,570
most certainly.

4450
02:02:56,780 --> 02:02:58,790
What's the longest you've
ever done a video for?

4451
02:02:58,970 --> 02:03:02,420
Anything that's like really complex
that warrants a much longer,

4452
02:03:02,421 --> 02:03:02,871
you know,

4453
02:03:02,871 --> 02:03:04,310
you can get up into like 10,

4454
02:03:04,311 --> 02:03:04,881
15,

4455
02:03:04,881 --> 02:03:06,050
maybe 15,

4456
02:03:06,051 --> 02:03:06,561
like what would it be?

4457
02:03:06,561 --> 02:03:10,880
15 like a new phone or something like
really competent kind of comparison like

4458
02:03:10,881 --> 02:03:12,470
something versus something else.

4459
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:14,580
But you don't like
limit yourself like you,

4460
02:03:14,750 --> 02:03:15,640
well there's this it.

4461
02:03:16,940 --> 02:03:17,760
Listen if you're getting,

4462
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:19,820
you had to be smart in anything that you,

4463
02:03:19,880 --> 02:03:24,680
that you do if you're investing a lot of
time in it and so there is definitely a

4464
02:03:24,681 --> 02:03:25,640
retention issue.

4465
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:26,833
We,

4466
02:03:26,900 --> 02:03:30,230
if we're willing to identify the fact
that consumption habits are changing and

4467
02:03:30,231 --> 02:03:33,830
the web is the driving force behind that
and we also need to be cognizant of the

4468
02:03:33,831 --> 02:03:38,330
fact that we need to fit within a
certain fit within certain boundaries.

4469
02:03:38,331 --> 02:03:41,180
Even though those boundaries are loose
and no one's going to fucking tell you

4470
02:03:41,181 --> 02:03:42,014
one way or the other.

4471
02:03:42,590 --> 02:03:45,620
A lot of the conversations I have
in brainstorming that I do is about

4472
02:03:45,621 --> 02:03:50,510
hyper-focusing and iterating and finding
better ways of reaching people and we

4473
02:03:50,511 --> 02:03:51,140
just,

4474
02:03:51,140 --> 02:03:52,220
I think a lot of us,

4475
02:03:52,250 --> 02:03:56,150
I'm speaking I guess for the community
as a whole have figured out that three to

4476
02:03:56,151 --> 02:03:58,010
five minutes is just what makes sense.

4477
02:03:58,650 --> 02:04:01,640
Three to five minutes is
a song length as well.

4478
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:02,151
Yeah,

4479
02:04:02,151 --> 02:04:02,984
it's a really weird,

4480
02:04:02,990 --> 02:04:04,550
it's really weird that
it lines up that way.

4481
02:04:04,640 --> 02:04:06,020
Three minutes is what they say.

4482
02:04:06,021 --> 02:04:06,320
Right.

4483
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:07,770
You see like something

4484
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:09,950
for sure.

4485
02:04:09,950 --> 02:04:10,783
Something weird.

4486
02:04:11,270 --> 02:04:13,280
We don't have a youtube
up there right now,

4487
02:04:13,281 --> 02:04:16,160
but if you look at the youtube interface,

4488
02:04:16,190 --> 02:04:19,820
it's a lot of thought goes into
the way things are laid out.

4489
02:04:19,821 --> 02:04:21,590
People freak out whenever
anything changes.

4490
02:04:21,591 --> 02:04:23,000
And why the fuck is that?

4491
02:04:23,010 --> 02:04:25,370
Their Google stupid people
love seeing the shit like that.

4492
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:25,481
Yeah.

4493
02:04:25,481 --> 02:04:28,070
Youtube does a pretty
decent job of setting up.

4494
02:04:28,071 --> 02:04:29,870
Like if you watch click
on one of those videos,

4495
02:04:29,871 --> 02:04:30,560
Brian,

4496
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:31,910
like one of your videos,

4497
02:04:32,060 --> 02:04:34,490
you would look on the right
and you get suggested stuff.

4498
02:04:34,520 --> 02:04:34,930
Others.

4499
02:04:34,930 --> 02:04:35,110
Yeah,

4500
02:04:35,110 --> 02:04:35,510
that's,

4501
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:38,310
that's what sends you
down those rabbit holes.

4502
02:04:39,030 --> 02:04:40,320
That's where shit gets weird.

4503
02:04:40,321 --> 02:04:40,891
But here's the,

4504
02:04:40,891 --> 02:04:43,410
so here's the thing about this frame
right now that we're looking at,

4505
02:04:44,670 --> 02:04:48,600
at what point does this video become
less enticing than the juicy shit on the

4506
02:04:48,601 --> 02:04:49,380
right,

4507
02:04:49,380 --> 02:04:50,213
right.

4508
02:04:50,580 --> 02:04:51,540
He say he Fullscreen did,

4509
02:04:51,541 --> 02:04:52,410
so he kind of killed it.

4510
02:04:52,410 --> 02:04:53,460
But full screening,

4511
02:04:53,461 --> 02:04:55,590
it definitely does Fullscreen and it does.

4512
02:04:55,950 --> 02:04:56,280
Right?

4513
02:04:56,280 --> 02:04:58,320
But why is it youtube not by default,

4514
02:04:58,350 --> 02:04:59,460
a Fullscreen interface?

4515
02:05:00,090 --> 02:05:00,840
Well,

4516
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:04,350
because they're about
view times as a whole.

4517
02:05:04,870 --> 02:05:06,120
Can we talk about this last time?

4518
02:05:06,270 --> 02:05:06,780
Did that,

4519
02:05:06,780 --> 02:05:07,290
did we?

4520
02:05:07,290 --> 02:05:08,123
I don't remember,

4521
02:05:08,340 --> 02:05:09,780
but that totally makes sense.

4522
02:05:09,781 --> 02:05:10,680
The way they're designed.

4523
02:05:10,681 --> 02:05:12,060
I think it's the perfect design.

4524
02:05:12,210 --> 02:05:17,210
Also the comments as a name and retarded
and fucking aggravating as they can be.

4525
02:05:18,420 --> 02:05:22,380
They engage people and get people
to spend more time participate.

4526
02:05:22,530 --> 02:05:27,210
There's some folks that just do not have
an outlet and I think that's sometimes

4527
02:05:27,211 --> 02:05:32,211
reflected in the angry and
anger and vitriol that you
see exhibited on a youtube

4528
02:05:32,911 --> 02:05:33,420
page.

4529
02:05:33,420 --> 02:05:36,720
It's not even representative oftentimes
of what they're actually reviewing.

4530
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:37,160
It's,

4531
02:05:37,160 --> 02:05:40,550
it's a reflection of their own life is
that people don't feel like they are

4532
02:05:40,551 --> 02:05:41,280
heard.

4533
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:42,630
They don't feel like they matter.

4534
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:44,280
They don't feel like they have a voice.

4535
02:05:44,430 --> 02:05:46,200
And then finally when
they do have a voice,

4536
02:05:46,201 --> 02:05:47,034
like

4537
02:05:48,210 --> 02:05:49,920
what they're saying is
no one wants to fuck me.

4538
02:05:49,921 --> 02:05:51,360
My boss is an asshole.

4539
02:05:51,480 --> 02:05:52,980
I picked the shitty career.

4540
02:05:53,220 --> 02:05:53,701
You know,

4541
02:05:53,701 --> 02:05:55,990
I don't like where I live.

4542
02:05:56,010 --> 02:06:01,010
Sort of feel like people within those
communities don't get enough recognition

4543
02:06:01,531 --> 02:06:02,130
though.

4544
02:06:02,130 --> 02:06:03,720
So like which communities,

4545
02:06:04,080 --> 02:06:05,340
so like my,

4546
02:06:05,370 --> 02:06:06,750
let's say my best viewers,

4547
02:06:06,870 --> 02:06:07,920
let's say your best viewers,

4548
02:06:07,921 --> 02:06:09,300
anyone's the best.

4549
02:06:09,330 --> 02:06:10,500
They're all the same to me,

4550
02:06:10,690 --> 02:06:12,510
the fuck out of my awesome people.

4551
02:06:12,540 --> 02:06:13,373
Get it on my face right now.

4552
02:06:13,380 --> 02:06:14,213
How dare you.

4553
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:15,113
Listen,

4554
02:06:15,150 --> 02:06:18,540
there are people who are
fucking Joe Rogan diehards.

4555
02:06:18,630 --> 02:06:22,590
Those people matter more to
you than the hundred thousands,

4556
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:27,800
100,000 others that are
fair weather type viewers.

4557
02:06:28,200 --> 02:06:29,550
They're evangelists for you.

4558
02:06:29,820 --> 02:06:31,470
They're out there saying to their buddies,

4559
02:06:31,560 --> 02:06:32,610
you fucking hear the podcast.

4560
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:33,870
Go check out the podcast.

4561
02:06:33,900 --> 02:06:35,280
You need to hear this podcast.

4562
02:06:35,490 --> 02:06:37,590
Check out this guest he
had on so on and so forth.

4563
02:06:37,591 --> 02:06:38,700
Don't tell them they're important.

4564
02:06:38,701 --> 02:06:41,280
Then they're going to want more attention
and then to know what are you doing?

4565
02:06:41,490 --> 02:06:42,420
No locking up everything.

4566
02:06:42,421 --> 02:06:44,400
There's a way that there's
a way this can work,

4567
02:06:44,580 --> 02:06:45,690
the way that it can work.

4568
02:06:45,720 --> 02:06:46,200
Yeah,

4569
02:06:46,200 --> 02:06:49,400
mushrooms and everybody's got to get
on mushrooms together at the same time,

4570
02:06:49,420 --> 02:06:49,740
I don't know.

4571
02:06:49,740 --> 02:06:50,610
Here's how it works.

4572
02:06:50,670 --> 02:06:55,670
We need to find a way to reward the
most important in our own communities.

4573
02:06:57,090 --> 02:06:57,391
Okay?

4574
02:06:57,391 --> 02:06:58,380
Because here's why.

4575
02:06:59,190 --> 02:07:03,240
It's not fair that they're out there as
evangelists for our brands and yet they

4576
02:07:03,241 --> 02:07:04,110
get nothing out of it.

4577
02:07:04,590 --> 02:07:05,610
What are you talking about?

4578
02:07:05,611 --> 02:07:07,380
They get the entertainment out of it.

4579
02:07:07,530 --> 02:07:08,850
That's the whole exchange.

4580
02:07:08,851 --> 02:07:09,684
That's fine.

4581
02:07:09,960 --> 02:07:10,950
Other than the entertainment,

4582
02:07:10,951 --> 02:07:12,420
then it changes and morphs.

4583
02:07:12,450 --> 02:07:14,430
That's fine if they get the
entertainment out of it,

4584
02:07:14,850 --> 02:07:17,820
but so to somebody else who shuts the
fuck up immediately after they watch it,

4585
02:07:17,910 --> 02:07:21,600
the part they're doing on their own time
is not about the entertainment anymore.

4586
02:07:21,630 --> 02:07:21,871
Right.

4587
02:07:21,871 --> 02:07:22,531
But she don't,

4588
02:07:22,531 --> 02:07:25,100
you do that as well and don't I
do that as well and do what he,

4589
02:07:25,200 --> 02:07:27,810
but you talk about things
that you enjoy and the,

4590
02:07:27,811 --> 02:07:30,600
the benefit of that is that you
support the things that you enjoy.

4591
02:07:30,750 --> 02:07:32,390
Like game of Thrones for instance,

4592
02:07:32,940 --> 02:07:34,320
evangelists of game of Thrones.

4593
02:07:34,440 --> 02:07:35,273
You can't stop talking.

4594
02:07:35,380 --> 02:07:39,070
They've never paid me
wouldn't did I say pay?

4595
02:07:39,370 --> 02:07:40,570
What do you mean by reward?

4596
02:07:40,870 --> 02:07:45,430
There are ways to recognize without
necessarily paying somebody like who's,

4597
02:07:45,790 --> 02:07:46,630
let's put it this way.

4598
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:48,400
Who's your most engaged Twitter follower?

4599
02:07:48,401 --> 02:07:49,930
Who Do you talk to more than anyone else?

4600
02:07:50,620 --> 02:07:52,000
I don't think I have a one.

4601
02:07:52,360 --> 02:07:53,490
You probably do know,

4602
02:07:53,560 --> 02:07:54,710
but I'd done saying have one.

4603
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:55,780
We don't have inaccurate.

4604
02:07:55,820 --> 02:07:57,580
We don't have an accurate
way of figuring out.

4605
02:07:57,840 --> 02:07:58,673
I would like,

4606
02:07:58,750 --> 02:08:02,290
you know what would be interesting to
me to know who has tweeted at Joe Rogan

4607
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:05,850
more than any other user
going to attract a psych?

4608
02:08:05,910 --> 02:08:07,090
Oh No,

4609
02:08:07,840 --> 02:08:08,673
it's me.

4610
02:08:08,760 --> 02:08:10,990
I am the one I am Highlander.

4611
02:08:12,940 --> 02:08:15,670
You're essentially sending out
a bat signal to crazy people.

4612
02:08:15,810 --> 02:08:16,440
No,

4613
02:08:16,440 --> 02:08:16,580
no,

4614
02:08:16,580 --> 02:08:20,020
I'm not going all crazy beyond not because
in the real world stuff like this has

4615
02:08:20,021 --> 02:08:21,550
existed for the longest time.

4616
02:08:21,551 --> 02:08:23,660
Like take for example a forum.

4617
02:08:23,990 --> 02:08:25,210
A forum is not in the real world,

4618
02:08:25,211 --> 02:08:27,310
but it's an older platform in a,

4619
02:08:28,030 --> 02:08:28,863
in a forum.

4620
02:08:29,110 --> 02:08:32,050
Game of Thrones sent me a box that counts.

4621
02:08:32,230 --> 02:08:33,250
That fucking counts.

4622
02:08:33,251 --> 02:08:33,821
By the way.

4623
02:08:33,821 --> 02:08:34,654
It's true.

4624
02:08:35,140 --> 02:08:38,620
Well they did that after I talked
about them for that fucking counts.

4625
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:40,240
They didn't just send
it just to me either,

4626
02:08:40,241 --> 02:08:40,600
by the way.

4627
02:08:40,600 --> 02:08:41,020
Okay.

4628
02:08:41,020 --> 02:08:41,201
No,

4629
02:08:41,201 --> 02:08:41,351
no,

4630
02:08:41,351 --> 02:08:42,184
I know.

4631
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:43,780
But like what are you talking about?

4632
02:08:43,781 --> 02:08:45,820
Like in what way would you reward them?

4633
02:08:46,330 --> 02:08:47,890
So what do you got
planned in the old days?

4634
02:08:47,891 --> 02:08:50,560
On a forum forum in the old days,

4635
02:08:50,990 --> 02:08:52,100
but what all did he,

4636
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:56,830
mine has been around since 1998 I thought
I had the oldest form on the net or

4637
02:08:56,831 --> 02:08:58,960
it's one of the oldest forms to me.

4638
02:08:58,990 --> 02:09:00,040
When I get in a forum,

4639
02:09:00,041 --> 02:09:01,390
I feel like I'm in the old internet.

4640
02:09:01,690 --> 02:09:02,170
Okay.

4641
02:09:02,170 --> 02:09:07,170
And the reason is because social media
to me has sort of sort of absorbed some

4642
02:09:07,871 --> 02:09:10,810
of what forms are used
to be for socializing.

4643
02:09:11,170 --> 02:09:11,501
Right?

4644
02:09:11,501 --> 02:09:11,860
Right.

4645
02:09:11,860 --> 02:09:13,420
So I kind of look at social networks.

4646
02:09:13,421 --> 02:09:15,280
It's like forum 2.0 or whatever.

4647
02:09:15,310 --> 02:09:15,880
Right?

4648
02:09:15,880 --> 02:09:16,510
But Anyway,

4649
02:09:16,510 --> 02:09:18,310
forum still exists and that's cool.

4650
02:09:19,330 --> 02:09:20,170
But on a forum,

4651
02:09:20,440 --> 02:09:22,840
the people who participate like crazy,

4652
02:09:22,990 --> 02:09:24,430
in some forums they have,

4653
02:09:24,520 --> 02:09:26,110
they have like five stars or something,

4654
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:28,050
or they're a reps,

4655
02:09:28,080 --> 02:09:29,080
a contributor or wrap,

4656
02:09:29,110 --> 02:09:29,943
a moderator,

4657
02:09:31,050 --> 02:09:35,320
Ma like moderators take lots
of pride in being moderators,

4658
02:09:35,410 --> 02:09:38,440
even though they're not getting
paid to be moderators right now,

4659
02:09:38,441 --> 02:09:39,101
granted,

4660
02:09:39,101 --> 02:09:42,220
you can have circumstances where
things get fucking creepy and weird.

4661
02:09:42,680 --> 02:09:43,110
That's,

4662
02:09:43,110 --> 02:09:43,841
that's going to happen.

4663
02:09:43,841 --> 02:09:45,040
That's inevitably going to happen.

4664
02:09:45,070 --> 02:09:46,060
But for each one of them,

4665
02:09:46,061 --> 02:09:50,170
there's a hundred cool people who want
to participate in your community and just

4666
02:09:50,171 --> 02:09:52,990
get a little bit of recognition
for that participation.

4667
02:09:53,140 --> 02:09:57,040
I really want to know who has tweeted at
unbox therapy therapy more than anyone

4668
02:09:57,041 --> 02:09:57,520
else.

4669
02:09:57,520 --> 02:09:58,690
I wonder who that person is.

4670
02:09:59,380 --> 02:10:00,100
Not because,

4671
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:01,600
not because I want to stock them,

4672
02:10:01,601 --> 02:10:05,760
but because I want to find a way
to thank them for stalking you.

4673
02:10:06,900 --> 02:10:08,350
So you think you're making,

4674
02:10:08,351 --> 02:10:10,690
you're taking the totally
negative approach on this.

4675
02:10:10,691 --> 02:10:12,520
I can't help but it's very optimistic.

4676
02:10:12,740 --> 02:10:13,750
Be Optimistic.

4677
02:10:13,751 --> 02:10:16,690
Normally you're the optimistic
one right on the podcast and the,

4678
02:10:16,691 --> 02:10:18,760
the person in this seat
is the pessimistic one.

4679
02:10:18,790 --> 02:10:19,690
Not necessarily,

4680
02:10:19,870 --> 02:10:24,870
but I think that w I agree in
form of what you're saying.

4681
02:10:25,980 --> 02:10:26,260
Um,

4682
02:10:26,260 --> 02:10:27,720
but I think that what the,

4683
02:10:27,750 --> 02:10:31,360
the beauty and the purity
of the relationship between
someone who likes your

4684
02:10:31,361 --> 02:10:33,680
show and someone comments on your show,

4685
02:10:33,830 --> 02:10:38,830
someone who enjoys you show is that
your show gets more recognition,

4686
02:10:38,871 --> 02:10:43,550
more hits and it continues to grow and
they get better content because they

4687
02:10:43,551 --> 02:10:44,240
enjoy it,

4688
02:10:44,240 --> 02:10:44,841
they enjoy it,

4689
02:10:44,841 --> 02:10:46,100
it makes their life interesting.

4690
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:46,761
You know,

4691
02:10:46,761 --> 02:10:49,880
I try as much as possible
like when I'm on,

4692
02:10:49,940 --> 02:10:51,080
if you look at my Twitter,

4693
02:10:51,230 --> 02:10:55,550
one of the things that is about my
Twitter that's important to me is anything

4694
02:10:55,551 --> 02:10:58,190
that I find that's
interesting online I share,

4695
02:10:58,250 --> 02:10:58,520
right?

4696
02:10:58,520 --> 02:11:03,110
So not everything because he would be
as non box therapy on a constant stream.

4697
02:11:03,170 --> 02:11:04,770
I put that I'm just fucking around dairy,

4698
02:11:05,510 --> 02:11:10,510
but it would be a constant stream
of videos and content I can't do,

4699
02:11:11,300 --> 02:11:12,170
I can't do everything,

4700
02:11:12,200 --> 02:11:15,950
but things that I think
are fascinating like um,

4701
02:11:16,010 --> 02:11:17,240
or important.

4702
02:11:17,241 --> 02:11:17,511
Like,

4703
02:11:17,511 --> 02:11:17,990
uh,

4704
02:11:17,990 --> 02:11:22,520
I put up something on from
science magazine about a
widespread contamination of

4705
02:11:22,521 --> 02:11:24,530
the marine environment by microplastics,

4706
02:11:24,531 --> 02:11:28,100
which I think is really a
sad and remember of course,

4707
02:11:28,101 --> 02:11:28,271
yeah,

4708
02:11:28,271 --> 02:11:29,104
you know,

4709
02:11:29,180 --> 02:11:32,060
reversible but needs to be addressed.

4710
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:36,020
Part of our society and
the use of plastics in our
relationship with the oceans.

4711
02:11:36,170 --> 02:11:37,220
Thinking along those lines,

4712
02:11:37,280 --> 02:11:37,940
um,

4713
02:11:37,940 --> 02:11:41,960
sexy photos on Facebook may cause
women to be seen as less competent.

4714
02:11:42,140 --> 02:11:43,730
That's from the science world report.

4715
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:44,690
That's another thing that I tweeted.

4716
02:11:45,110 --> 02:11:45,741
Fascinating.

4717
02:11:45,741 --> 02:11:46,031
Right?

4718
02:11:46,031 --> 02:11:46,340
Yeah.

4719
02:11:46,340 --> 02:11:47,000
Interesting.

4720
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,190
So I put a lot of that online.

4721
02:11:49,220 --> 02:11:51,950
So I feel like that is you're
adding value for people.

4722
02:11:52,010 --> 02:11:52,310
Yeah,

4723
02:11:52,310 --> 02:11:52,850
definitely.

4724
02:11:52,850 --> 02:11:53,683
And it's awesome.

4725
02:11:53,720 --> 02:11:55,580
It gives them an incentive also,

4726
02:11:55,940 --> 02:12:00,620
selfishly to tweet me these interesting
things so that I retweet them because I

4727
02:12:00,621 --> 02:12:02,270
do that all the time to followers.

4728
02:12:02,430 --> 02:12:02,810
Yeah,

4729
02:12:02,810 --> 02:12:05,120
a lot of followers and
recognition and people,

4730
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:05,541
you know,

4731
02:12:05,541 --> 02:12:05,991
people like,

4732
02:12:05,991 --> 02:12:06,111
well,

4733
02:12:06,111 --> 02:12:06,770
that's a perfect,

4734
02:12:06,770 --> 02:12:07,820
that's a perfect example.

4735
02:12:07,821 --> 02:12:08,031
I mean,

4736
02:12:08,031 --> 02:12:11,720
that's part of the reason that
I love Twitter is that you,

4737
02:12:11,750 --> 02:12:13,220
they know you see them,

4738
02:12:13,790 --> 02:12:15,080
but seeing youtube comments,

4739
02:12:15,140 --> 02:12:15,351
I mean,

4740
02:12:15,351 --> 02:12:16,250
you can reply.

4741
02:12:16,251 --> 02:12:17,960
It's impossible to reply to everyone,

4742
02:12:18,380 --> 02:12:20,120
but on Twitter you see one,

4743
02:12:20,121 --> 02:12:21,230
one guy gets retweeted,

4744
02:12:21,231 --> 02:12:21,531
you think,

4745
02:12:21,531 --> 02:12:21,801
well,

4746
02:12:21,801 --> 02:12:23,570
I could get retweeted at some point later.

4747
02:12:23,930 --> 02:12:26,990
Something that's been a big conversation
lately is the favorite button.

4748
02:12:28,100 --> 02:12:29,300
Are you a fan of the favorite button?

4749
02:12:29,390 --> 02:12:30,200
No,

4750
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:31,250
it doesn't make any sense to me.

4751
02:12:31,670 --> 02:12:32,120
Yeah.

4752
02:12:32,120 --> 02:12:32,361
Well,

4753
02:12:32,361 --> 02:12:34,160
it doesn't make a lot of
sense to a lot of people.

4754
02:12:34,680 --> 02:12:35,990
People use it for different reasons.

4755
02:12:35,991 --> 02:12:37,430
Some people use it to save tweets,

4756
02:12:37,910 --> 02:12:40,460
but that's not the way I use it at all.

4757
02:12:40,700 --> 02:12:42,140
I could care less about saving tweets.

4758
02:12:42,150 --> 02:12:43,820
Most of the time I could use it that way.

4759
02:12:43,821 --> 02:12:46,280
But the majority of how I use
it as a recognition piece.

4760
02:12:46,550 --> 02:12:47,960
So you are cool.

4761
02:12:48,170 --> 02:12:49,370
You sent me some cool shit.

4762
02:12:49,400 --> 02:12:50,630
I can't retweet it right now,

4763
02:12:50,660 --> 02:12:51,493
but I see you.

4764
02:12:51,620 --> 02:12:52,340
But why?

4765
02:12:52,340 --> 02:12:53,330
Why can't you retweet it?

4766
02:12:53,420 --> 02:12:57,020
It's just as easy to press retweet and
it's just depressing because ultimately

4767
02:12:57,021 --> 02:12:58,220
you need to curate your feed.

4768
02:12:58,340 --> 02:12:59,330
If you retweet everything,

4769
02:12:59,331 --> 02:13:00,170
everyone's ends you,

4770
02:13:00,200 --> 02:13:00,890
you're fucked.

4771
02:13:00,890 --> 02:13:01,580
Right?

4772
02:13:01,580 --> 02:13:04,550
But if you sit a Cylance
feed and favorites,

4773
02:13:04,790 --> 02:13:05,330
no mom,

4774
02:13:05,330 --> 02:13:05,540
no.

4775
02:13:05,540 --> 02:13:06,040
So like,

4776
02:13:06,040 --> 02:13:07,220
so what I mean no favors.

4777
02:13:07,610 --> 02:13:08,810
Well favorite to do come up,

4778
02:13:08,811 --> 02:13:09,644
but it's kind of,

4779
02:13:09,800 --> 02:13:11,690
you have to go there to get it right.

4780
02:13:11,720 --> 02:13:12,590
Meaning if you favorite,

4781
02:13:12,591 --> 02:13:14,000
something is not going to go on your feet.

4782
02:13:14,060 --> 02:13:14,480
Right.

4783
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:17,720
So a favorites are a little
tougher to get your hands on.

4784
02:13:17,780 --> 02:13:18,680
I see what you're saying.

4785
02:13:18,681 --> 02:13:21,830
So you're letting someone
know that you see them,

4786
02:13:21,831 --> 02:13:23,930
you give them a response
by favoriting their tweet,

4787
02:13:24,200 --> 02:13:27,200
but you don't put it on
your feed so they can,

4788
02:13:27,201 --> 02:13:28,370
they know that you see them.

4789
02:13:28,410 --> 02:13:28,630
Yeah,

4790
02:13:28,630 --> 02:13:29,301
that makes sense.

4791
02:13:29,301 --> 02:13:29,571
Actually.

4792
02:13:29,571 --> 02:13:32,040
That's the best use of
it that I've ever heard.

4793
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:33,180
I do it as a bookmark.

4794
02:13:33,780 --> 02:13:34,613
That's how it was.

4795
02:13:34,680 --> 02:13:35,970
That's what it was intended for.

4796
02:13:36,060 --> 02:13:36,181
Yeah.

4797
02:13:36,181 --> 02:13:37,050
That's how I've used it.

4798
02:13:37,080 --> 02:13:37,780
That's the only way I've,

4799
02:13:37,780 --> 02:13:40,830
I've intended as a bookmark and
there's this growing group of people.

4800
02:13:40,831 --> 02:13:41,521
I don't know how many,

4801
02:13:41,521 --> 02:13:43,410
but when I talk about it on Twitter,

4802
02:13:43,470 --> 02:13:45,180
a lot of people said they're
doing the same thing.

4803
02:13:45,480 --> 02:13:49,770
It's a movement to try and generate
essentially a like button on Twitter where

4804
02:13:49,771 --> 02:13:50,604
it doesn't exist.

4805
02:13:50,930 --> 02:13:51,231
Okay,

4806
02:13:51,231 --> 02:13:53,690
so the favorite becomes
a like button sort of.

4807
02:13:53,780 --> 02:13:54,530
I liked that.

4808
02:13:54,530 --> 02:13:58,850
I liked that because I can actually use
that way more because the way I use it

4809
02:13:58,851 --> 02:13:59,030
now,

4810
02:13:59,030 --> 02:13:59,863
I just,

4811
02:14:00,140 --> 02:14:00,973
I just don't,

4812
02:14:00,980 --> 02:14:01,813
I can't,

4813
02:14:01,820 --> 02:14:02,591
there's no way I can know.

4814
02:14:02,591 --> 02:14:03,880
You can't name that comes my way.

4815
02:14:03,900 --> 02:14:05,480
Even see everything that comes your way.

4816
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:06,353
No,

4817
02:14:06,400 --> 02:14:10,460
but if you're sitting on Twitter and
somebody takes the effort to to like they

4818
02:14:10,461 --> 02:14:11,240
thought of you,

4819
02:14:11,240 --> 02:14:12,380
they saw this cool thing,

4820
02:14:12,381 --> 02:14:13,280
they thought of you,

4821
02:14:13,820 --> 02:14:17,390
you hit the star button and
it's like there's an exchange.

4822
02:14:17,391 --> 02:14:18,300
There are,

4823
02:14:18,350 --> 02:14:19,490
there is some recognition.

4824
02:14:19,491 --> 02:14:20,750
It's not a dollar value,

4825
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:22,580
but that's the kind of
stuff I'm talking about.

4826
02:14:22,980 --> 02:14:24,710
I'm talking about nurturing a community.

4827
02:14:25,230 --> 02:14:25,980
That makes sense.

4828
02:14:25,980 --> 02:14:26,970
That totally makes sense.

4829
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:27,661
And then that,

4830
02:14:27,661 --> 02:14:28,180
um,

4831
02:14:28,180 --> 02:14:33,180
I think nurturing and community also
comes from being engaged from reading your

4832
02:14:34,171 --> 02:14:37,750
comments and maybe commenting on
them in another podcast or another,

4833
02:14:37,751 --> 02:14:38,820
a video cast,

4834
02:14:38,821 --> 02:14:39,900
whatever you would like to call it.

4835
02:14:40,170 --> 02:14:40,980
Or um,

4836
02:14:40,980 --> 02:14:41,813
Twitter,

4837
02:14:41,850 --> 02:14:42,121
you know,

4838
02:14:42,121 --> 02:14:44,490
engaging with people as much as possible,

4839
02:14:44,491 --> 02:14:46,590
answering questions as much as possible.

4840
02:14:46,591 --> 02:14:48,300
But with me,

4841
02:14:48,330 --> 02:14:52,860
there's a certain balance of
engaging and still getting work done.

4842
02:14:52,861 --> 02:14:53,700
Like my,

4843
02:14:54,330 --> 02:14:56,790
my thing is all about producing content.

4844
02:14:57,300 --> 02:14:57,871
I produce,

4845
02:14:57,871 --> 02:14:58,410
yeah.

4846
02:14:58,410 --> 02:14:59,700
Hours of a podcast.

4847
02:14:59,701 --> 02:15:00,180
Yeah,

4848
02:15:00,180 --> 02:15:01,440
three days a week,

4849
02:15:01,441 --> 02:15:02,251
most of the time.

4850
02:15:02,251 --> 02:15:06,570
And then there's the writing of comedy
and have random thoughts that that have

4851
02:15:06,571 --> 02:15:07,404
to take place.

4852
02:15:07,620 --> 02:15:08,790
If it doesn't take place,

4853
02:15:09,030 --> 02:15:10,200
my common you'll suffer.

4854
02:15:10,680 --> 02:15:14,280
And probably my conversations that
I have on podcasts will suffer.

4855
02:15:14,281 --> 02:15:19,281
I need to think about ideas by myself
as well as have them in a conversation

4856
02:15:19,651 --> 02:15:20,400
with people.

4857
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:22,890
And then there's also
the researching of Shit,

4858
02:15:22,891 --> 02:15:24,270
the reading of articles,

4859
02:15:24,271 --> 02:15:25,830
the watching of documentaries,

4860
02:15:25,831 --> 02:15:27,660
the reading of magazines or books.

4861
02:15:28,140 --> 02:15:33,140
The amount of time that's leftover to
just engage with people online is pretty

4862
02:15:33,361 --> 02:15:33,810
minimal.

4863
02:15:33,810 --> 02:15:35,880
And if you change the balance in any way,

4864
02:15:36,330 --> 02:15:38,310
all the content that you put out suffers.

4865
02:15:38,370 --> 02:15:38,700
Right.

4866
02:15:38,700 --> 02:15:42,180
And I think it's easy to forget that
the content in and of itself is a

4867
02:15:42,181 --> 02:15:42,990
communication.

4868
02:15:42,990 --> 02:15:43,500
Yes.

4869
02:15:43,500 --> 02:15:45,000
Meaning that like it's,

4870
02:15:45,080 --> 02:15:47,340
it's similar to what I said
before about the best buy thing.

4871
02:15:47,370 --> 02:15:51,210
How essentially we took a traditional
model of this guy in his best buy store

4872
02:15:51,270 --> 02:15:55,710
and we said this is much more dynamic and
it's much more streamlined to take one

4873
02:15:55,711 --> 02:15:57,230
guy who really knows and
give that to everyone.

4874
02:15:57,231 --> 02:15:57,360
Well,

4875
02:15:57,360 --> 02:16:02,360
video is this way of having one
message suitable or sent to hundreds,

4876
02:16:03,960 --> 02:16:03,960
thousands,

4877
02:16:03,960 --> 02:16:04,793
millions of people.

4878
02:16:04,920 --> 02:16:06,900
Whereas it's a personalized tweet.

4879
02:16:06,930 --> 02:16:07,763
I'm sorry.

4880
02:16:07,980 --> 02:16:10,830
If you were to sit there all day
and answer every tweet you ever got,

4881
02:16:10,831 --> 02:16:12,360
you'd never make another
thing in your life.

4882
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:13,080
Exactly.

4883
02:16:13,080 --> 02:16:16,200
And ultimately the reason people care
about you in the first place is because of

4884
02:16:16,201 --> 02:16:17,250
all the cool shit you made.

4885
02:16:17,610 --> 02:16:17,791
Yeah,

4886
02:16:17,791 --> 02:16:18,624
there's a balance.

4887
02:16:18,700 --> 02:16:19,320
Yeah,

4888
02:16:19,320 --> 02:16:19,521
it's an,

4889
02:16:19,521 --> 02:16:20,220
it may be,

4890
02:16:20,220 --> 02:16:20,670
who knows?

4891
02:16:20,670 --> 02:16:24,060
Maybe it's like a weekly asked me
anything sort of a thing like they do on

4892
02:16:24,061 --> 02:16:24,894
reddit.

4893
02:16:24,920 --> 02:16:25,221
Oh yeah,

4894
02:16:25,221 --> 02:16:25,810
he's read it.

4895
02:16:25,810 --> 02:16:26,601
Definitely kind of fun.

4896
02:16:26,601 --> 02:16:27,860
Some of the guys that we had with us,

4897
02:16:28,190 --> 02:16:31,660
big proponents of asking me
videos as well and you just,

4898
02:16:31,690 --> 02:16:35,740
you get thousands of questions and on
Twitter and you pick a few and addressing.

4899
02:16:35,800 --> 02:16:36,633
It's huge.

4900
02:16:36,640 --> 02:16:36,851
Yeah.

4901
02:16:36,851 --> 02:16:40,510
And I think that might be a better way
to do it even because writing things like

4902
02:16:40,511 --> 02:16:42,850
one of the issues that I
have with blog entries,

4903
02:16:42,851 --> 02:16:44,860
and I do enjoy reading people's blogs,

4904
02:16:44,861 --> 02:16:46,600
but one of the issues
that I have is that you,

4905
02:16:46,630 --> 02:16:50,440
if you give someone a free,

4906
02:16:50,770 --> 02:16:51,041
you know,

4907
02:16:51,041 --> 02:16:56,041
a page where it's just an open platform
to write things and to write about a

4908
02:16:56,351 --> 02:16:56,801
subject,

4909
02:16:56,801 --> 02:16:58,030
they're not opposed,

4910
02:16:58,300 --> 02:16:58,571
you know,

4911
02:16:58,571 --> 02:17:01,030
it's just their thoughts and
it's a way to express thoughts.

4912
02:17:01,210 --> 02:17:03,490
But they might be saying some incorrect,

4913
02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:08,350
incorrect and not factual
shit or distorted shit.

4914
02:17:08,590 --> 02:17:13,590
And they use that as the base for other
statements and they use that as a base

4915
02:17:13,601 --> 02:17:17,170
to further expand upon these thoughts
that were based almost entirely on

4916
02:17:17,171 --> 02:17:20,170
something incorrect in the first place
or distorted in the first place were

4917
02:17:20,350 --> 02:17:21,490
biased in the first place.

4918
02:17:21,700 --> 02:17:25,360
So it creates this piece like say if
someone was writing something about you,

4919
02:17:25,540 --> 02:17:28,630
like a really bias piece about
Lewis from unbox helping.

4920
02:17:28,660 --> 02:17:29,630
Thanks for giving him the idea.

4921
02:17:29,631 --> 02:17:30,430
You know what I'm saying?

4922
02:17:30,430 --> 02:17:35,140
They did do that and a lot of it was
based on some incorrect assumptions about

4923
02:17:35,141 --> 02:17:39,430
you as some incorrect information or
distorted perception probably exists.

4924
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:39,970
Sure.

4925
02:17:39,970 --> 02:17:40,660
I'm sure it does.

4926
02:17:40,660 --> 02:17:44,860
But my point being that that's a
really bad way to communicate ideas.

4927
02:17:44,861 --> 02:17:47,710
It's good for just trying to
shame someone or trying to,

4928
02:17:47,910 --> 02:17:48,240
uh,

4929
02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:48,550
you know,

4930
02:17:48,550 --> 02:17:50,920
just throw mud on their name,

4931
02:17:51,130 --> 02:17:51,490
but,

4932
02:17:51,490 --> 02:17:55,390
or to pray someone or to pump
someone up and create them,

4933
02:17:55,750 --> 02:17:56,920
create some art.

4934
02:17:56,980 --> 02:18:01,980
But the best way to express an idea is
to have that idea sort of vetted out with

4935
02:18:03,851 --> 02:18:04,590
another person.

4936
02:18:04,590 --> 02:18:05,110
Yeah.

4937
02:18:05,110 --> 02:18:05,411
You know,

4938
02:18:05,411 --> 02:18:05,701
and that,

4939
02:18:05,701 --> 02:18:06,590
that doesn't really,

4940
02:18:06,591 --> 02:18:06,860
that I,

4941
02:18:06,860 --> 02:18:09,280
that doesn't really happen
when you do it in that form.

4942
02:18:09,310 --> 02:18:10,143
No.

4943
02:18:10,200 --> 02:18:10,630
Yeah.

4944
02:18:10,630 --> 02:18:10,920
And,

4945
02:18:10,920 --> 02:18:13,140
and another thing too,

4946
02:18:13,190 --> 02:18:13,440
like,

4947
02:18:13,440 --> 02:18:18,440
well building on that is the fact that
video in and of itself is the closest

4948
02:18:18,871 --> 02:18:22,200
thing we have to real life
to actually meeting somebody.

4949
02:18:22,201 --> 02:18:22,621
Yes.

4950
02:18:22,621 --> 02:18:23,454
So you can,

4951
02:18:23,760 --> 02:18:24,593
you know,

4952
02:18:25,080 --> 02:18:29,130
you can take all of those things that
are happening within communication that

4953
02:18:29,131 --> 02:18:33,930
aren't necessarily the words themselves
and you can put those into the overall

4954
02:18:34,170 --> 02:18:38,430
sort of scenario and the line that
you're going to draw based on their

4955
02:18:38,431 --> 02:18:39,150
perspective.

4956
02:18:39,150 --> 02:18:40,710
You guys were talking recently about,

4957
02:18:40,980 --> 02:18:41,460
uh,

4958
02:18:41,460 --> 02:18:46,460
your buddy on Twitter who had the radio
show and said some stuff and then got

4959
02:18:46,861 --> 02:18:49,720
kicked off the radio show and yeah.

4960
02:18:50,550 --> 02:18:51,600
And you know,

4961
02:18:51,601 --> 02:18:55,950
con to how context in so many
ways dictates interpretation.

4962
02:18:56,550 --> 02:18:59,180
So if video is the best right videos,

4963
02:18:59,190 --> 02:19:03,780
this modern form of communication
and writing his fucking super old,

4964
02:19:05,310 --> 02:19:06,270
you look at the,

4965
02:19:06,320 --> 02:19:06,780
you will,

4966
02:19:06,780 --> 02:19:07,470
first of all,

4967
02:19:07,470 --> 02:19:08,430
one of them is way better.

4968
02:19:08,431 --> 02:19:10,350
But look at the reason
why writing was invented.

4969
02:19:10,351 --> 02:19:11,900
Writing was invented
because he didn't have,

4970
02:19:11,960 --> 02:19:12,160
well,

4971
02:19:12,160 --> 02:19:13,800
I wonder what was your alternative?

4972
02:19:14,010 --> 02:19:14,191
Right.

4973
02:19:14,191 --> 02:19:15,750
But I don't think it's way better.

4974
02:19:15,960 --> 02:19:16,350
Well,

4975
02:19:16,350 --> 02:19:20,430
because I think writing's has its
place definitely for some things,

4976
02:19:20,550 --> 02:19:20,650
right?

4977
02:19:20,650 --> 02:19:21,000
Yeah.

4978
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:21,930
I don't think I agree with you.

4979
02:19:21,931 --> 02:19:23,280
I don't think it's a
question of better or worse.

4980
02:19:23,340 --> 02:19:25,140
But look what television
did to newspapers.

4981
02:19:25,760 --> 02:19:26,593
Yeah.

4982
02:19:26,930 --> 02:19:28,220
Or the web did to newspapers,

4983
02:19:28,221 --> 02:19:28,790
right?

4984
02:19:28,790 --> 02:19:30,200
So it's one,

4985
02:19:30,230 --> 02:19:32,340
it's not better or worse or it's,

4986
02:19:32,360 --> 02:19:34,490
maybe it's the comic book
discussion all over again.

4987
02:19:34,940 --> 02:19:36,110
Something will win out.

4988
02:19:36,650 --> 02:19:37,520
It will happen.

4989
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:39,500
It is TV better for people.

4990
02:19:39,501 --> 02:19:40,340
The newspapers,

4991
02:19:41,150 --> 02:19:42,230
it doesn't really matter anymore.

4992
02:19:42,231 --> 02:19:44,210
It's a moot point because people chose TV.

4993
02:19:44,540 --> 02:19:44,871
Right.

4994
02:19:44,871 --> 02:19:46,520
But that's just because it's passive.

4995
02:19:46,550 --> 02:19:47,360
He just sit there.

4996
02:19:47,360 --> 02:19:48,193
That's right.

4997
02:19:48,260 --> 02:19:50,990
And it just comes to you when
given the choice between video.

4998
02:19:51,020 --> 02:19:52,760
Here's something that Google's testing is,

4999
02:19:52,761 --> 02:19:55,790
instead of giving you text based
search results on a Google search,

5000
02:19:55,791 --> 02:19:56,960
they give you video results.

5001
02:19:57,380 --> 02:19:57,920
They give you,

5002
02:19:57,920 --> 02:20:01,760
you can you Google something and there's
a video option for Google to serve up.

5003
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:02,690
They'll grab it.

5004
02:20:02,690 --> 02:20:05,150
That's a lot of my traffic
comes from Google search,

5005
02:20:05,151 --> 02:20:06,260
not youtube searches.

5006
02:20:06,860 --> 02:20:11,860
So Google knows that their objective is
to answer your question in the way that

5007
02:20:12,711 --> 02:20:13,790
you want to have it answered.

5008
02:20:14,450 --> 02:20:15,350
That makes sense,

5009
02:20:15,510 --> 02:20:15,860
right?

5010
02:20:15,860 --> 02:20:16,191
The bet.

5011
02:20:16,191 --> 02:20:18,230
The most suitable format
for you to ingest.

5012
02:20:18,500 --> 02:20:22,640
And oftentimes that means video because
retention times are better on video.

5013
02:20:22,641 --> 02:20:23,474
People,

5014
02:20:23,930 --> 02:20:25,430
I don't want to say are lazy people,

5015
02:20:25,431 --> 02:20:29,900
just like sophisticated delivery models
or like documentaries for me are an

5016
02:20:29,901 --> 02:20:31,010
amazing way to learn.

5017
02:20:31,370 --> 02:20:31,551
Well,

5018
02:20:31,551 --> 02:20:36,230
it's also you can't hide when if
someone writes something in print,

5019
02:20:36,530 --> 02:20:37,700
but they're full of shit.

5020
02:20:38,300 --> 02:20:39,133
It's hard.

5021
02:20:39,170 --> 02:20:39,551
Yeah.

5022
02:20:39,551 --> 02:20:42,320
It's hard to see that posing
less about themselves.

5023
02:20:42,321 --> 02:20:44,270
How much would you like if you ever read,

5024
02:20:44,271 --> 02:20:47,090
like you ever read a
really crazy tumbler site,

5025
02:20:47,120 --> 02:20:47,660
right?

5026
02:20:47,660 --> 02:20:48,020
And you're like,

5027
02:20:48,020 --> 02:20:48,411
oh my God,

5028
02:20:48,411 --> 02:20:50,630
I would so much rather hear you say this.

5029
02:20:51,080 --> 02:20:51,650
You know like,

5030
02:20:51,650 --> 02:20:51,791
oh,

5031
02:20:51,791 --> 02:20:56,791
like some crazy radical feminists
ranting anti male ran to.

5032
02:20:57,130 --> 02:21:00,410
Here's the thing about that too
is when you write something,

5033
02:21:00,980 --> 02:21:01,490
it's not,

5034
02:21:01,490 --> 02:21:03,740
it's nothing like plastering
your face on something.

5035
02:21:04,370 --> 02:21:07,580
I think these people wouldn't say half
the shit they said if it was their face

5036
02:21:07,581 --> 02:21:08,960
in front of every most likely.

5037
02:21:09,080 --> 02:21:09,530
Yeah.

5038
02:21:09,530 --> 02:21:12,800
And so if you would expose the
craziness would come out of it,

5039
02:21:12,801 --> 02:21:13,634
you would see it.

5040
02:21:13,670 --> 02:21:13,970
He goes,

5041
02:21:13,970 --> 02:21:14,660
oh,

5042
02:21:14,660 --> 02:21:16,170
you're a fucking banana.

5043
02:21:16,280 --> 02:21:16,611
Oh,

5044
02:21:16,611 --> 02:21:17,260
sorry,

5045
02:21:17,260 --> 02:21:17,501
I need,

5046
02:21:17,501 --> 02:21:18,680
I can stop watching this now.

5047
02:21:18,681 --> 02:21:23,660
Now I know what I'm dealing with or
I can watch this with a more level

5048
02:21:23,661 --> 02:21:24,350
perspective.

5049
02:21:24,350 --> 02:21:25,970
That's why I'm saying
that's what I'm saying.

5050
02:21:25,971 --> 02:21:26,900
Video is the ultimate,

5051
02:21:27,260 --> 02:21:28,970
the ultimate in terms of bits and bytes.

5052
02:21:29,390 --> 02:21:30,620
Think about the information.

5053
02:21:30,810 --> 02:21:32,720
I write down on a bunch
of shit on his notepad.

5054
02:21:33,020 --> 02:21:34,670
If I were to put that into bits and bytes,

5055
02:21:34,671 --> 02:21:36,530
take a photograph or type it out.

5056
02:21:36,830 --> 02:21:40,520
That's nothing at and can SMS
message in terms of size is not,

5057
02:21:40,550 --> 02:21:41,910
there's not very much data there.

5058
02:21:41,950 --> 02:21:43,180
You know it's true.

5059
02:21:43,510 --> 02:21:44,000
If I want.

5060
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:45,470
That's what held the web back.

5061
02:21:45,500 --> 02:21:46,700
That's why newspapers exist.

5062
02:21:46,701 --> 02:21:48,140
That's why we had to
send each other letters.

5063
02:21:48,260 --> 02:21:49,700
We didn't have the bandwidth.

5064
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:51,180
Ah,

5065
02:21:51,260 --> 02:21:52,610
now that we have the bandwidth,

5066
02:21:52,611 --> 02:21:54,770
we can transport ourselves.

5067
02:21:54,800 --> 02:21:59,270
The closest thing we can get to it across
the other way and so we have to stand

5068
02:21:59,271 --> 02:22:01,370
up for the shit that
we actually believe in.

5069
02:22:01,490 --> 02:22:02,810
We have to be authentic.

5070
02:22:02,811 --> 02:22:06,800
We have to all these other things
immediately fall into line because it's so

5071
02:22:06,801 --> 02:22:10,100
much harder to fake when you have
access to all that extra data.

5072
02:22:10,430 --> 02:22:15,430
Well then how come like a
sort of 15 second thing on
on Twitter hasn't taken off

5073
02:22:18,291 --> 02:22:20,210
like 140 character thing.

5074
02:22:20,600 --> 02:22:22,790
Like a 15 second video thing.

5075
02:22:22,820 --> 02:22:23,061
Oh,

5076
02:22:23,061 --> 02:22:24,170
like fine and shit.

5077
02:22:24,200 --> 02:22:24,830
Yeah,

5078
02:22:24,830 --> 02:22:25,663
like

5079
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:27,600
kind of silly.

5080
02:22:27,650 --> 02:22:28,020
Yeah.

5081
02:22:28,020 --> 02:22:29,220
Instagram is pretty big though.

5082
02:22:29,250 --> 02:22:29,581
Yeah.

5083
02:22:29,581 --> 02:22:29,851
Right.

5084
02:22:29,851 --> 02:22:30,271
But I mean,

5085
02:22:30,271 --> 02:22:32,220
how many people express themselves on it?

5086
02:22:32,400 --> 02:22:35,670
They have videos where they do things
like they'll skip forward jump Wu or

5087
02:22:35,671 --> 02:22:37,350
they'll fucking ride a motorcycle.

5088
02:22:37,351 --> 02:22:38,184
Woo.

5089
02:22:38,250 --> 02:22:38,491
You know,

5090
02:22:38,491 --> 02:22:39,271
they'll have that.

5091
02:22:39,271 --> 02:22:43,890
But how many of them are of people
staring at the camera and saying something

5092
02:22:43,891 --> 02:22:44,910
for 140 care,

5093
02:22:44,970 --> 02:22:46,170
440 characters.

5094
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:46,620
You know,

5095
02:22:46,620 --> 02:22:47,640
here's a huge community.

5096
02:22:47,641 --> 02:22:49,290
I mean Instagram taking a Manga.

5097
02:22:49,320 --> 02:22:49,860
I know,

5098
02:22:49,860 --> 02:22:51,930
but then Instagram is mostly pictures,

5099
02:22:52,170 --> 02:22:54,480
mostly pictures with
context underneath it.

5100
02:22:54,690 --> 02:22:55,380
How many?

5101
02:22:55,380 --> 02:22:55,780
Why?

5102
02:22:55,780 --> 02:22:58,380
What if we're talking about
the purest expression,

5103
02:22:58,410 --> 02:23:01,440
the closest thing you can get to an
actual person for the actual video like

5104
02:23:01,441 --> 02:23:01,830
this,

5105
02:23:01,830 --> 02:23:03,390
why isn't that taking off?

5106
02:23:03,460 --> 02:23:05,670
Whereas a pure video communication,

5107
02:23:05,730 --> 02:23:08,880
youtube vine be up at 15 seconds.

5108
02:23:09,060 --> 02:23:09,370
Why does,

5109
02:23:09,370 --> 02:23:09,830
why do you care?

5110
02:23:09,830 --> 02:23:11,720
Why do you want it to be 15 yeah,

5111
02:23:11,721 --> 02:23:12,420
that's what I know it.

5112
02:23:12,420 --> 02:23:13,253
That's fine.

5113
02:23:13,740 --> 02:23:18,000
But I know that because of like one of
the things that made Twitter stand out.

5114
02:23:18,120 --> 02:23:19,160
Oh,

5115
02:23:19,170 --> 02:23:21,240
40 courses concision I
see what you're saying.

5116
02:23:21,500 --> 02:23:21,820
Yeah.

5117
02:23:21,820 --> 02:23:23,850
So can we force concision with video?

5118
02:23:26,690 --> 02:23:27,160
Okay.

5119
02:23:27,160 --> 02:23:27,820
Is that possible?

5120
02:23:27,820 --> 02:23:29,620
What we're talking about
ultimate expression,

5121
02:23:29,800 --> 02:23:30,633
right?

5122
02:23:30,730 --> 02:23:35,730
The ultimate experience of somebody
and who they are and what they are.

5123
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:38,530
What you do over here,

5124
02:23:40,350 --> 02:23:41,310
three hours you kick me.

5125
02:23:41,620 --> 02:23:45,300
If we're agreeing that it's all
about faking it or not faking it,

5126
02:23:46,290 --> 02:23:50,160
it's only going to get astronomically
harder the longer you have to hold it up.

5127
02:23:50,360 --> 02:23:51,193
Right.

5128
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:51,981
I agree with that,

5129
02:23:51,981 --> 02:23:54,040
but what I'm saying is a takeout that I,

5130
02:23:54,041 --> 02:23:55,970
I definitely agree that to get a cross,

5131
02:23:55,971 --> 02:23:57,920
a more elaborate point of view,

5132
02:23:57,960 --> 02:23:58,290
right.

5133
02:23:58,290 --> 02:23:59,450
Discuss something in depth.

5134
02:23:59,630 --> 02:24:01,010
You would want a youtube video.

5135
02:24:01,020 --> 02:24:02,240
That's the benefit of youtube,

5136
02:24:02,540 --> 02:24:07,540
but like what about a something where I
guess a lot of Twitter is a sharing of

5137
02:24:08,121 --> 02:24:08,421
links,

5138
02:24:08,421 --> 02:24:09,740
but take away the sharing of links.

5139
02:24:09,980 --> 02:24:11,840
What's your new Captain
American movie today?

5140
02:24:11,900 --> 02:24:12,681
All my God,

5141
02:24:12,681 --> 02:24:14,710
did it suck a fat Dick gone.

5142
02:24:14,870 --> 02:24:15,380
That's it.

5143
02:24:15,380 --> 02:24:16,213
Vine.

5144
02:24:16,490 --> 02:24:17,870
But do they use it for that?

5145
02:24:18,030 --> 02:24:18,630
Yeah.

5146
02:24:18,630 --> 02:24:19,680
People use it for that.

5147
02:24:19,980 --> 02:24:21,840
Most of vine is like comedy stuff.

5148
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:24,510
The vast majority people joking around,

5149
02:24:24,600 --> 02:24:26,400
little tiny seven second skits.

5150
02:24:26,430 --> 02:24:26,940
Right?

5151
02:24:26,940 --> 02:24:30,210
Like some of the popular ones that I've
recognized is this thing where people

5152
02:24:30,211 --> 02:24:31,620
really like Jordan shoes.

5153
02:24:31,970 --> 02:24:32,310
I don't know,

5154
02:24:32,310 --> 02:24:36,570
you probably maybe saw this past around
where if a guy's really into sneakers,

5155
02:24:36,690 --> 02:24:36,910
he,

5156
02:24:36,910 --> 02:24:39,150
if he gets us a little
mark on his Jordans,

5157
02:24:39,151 --> 02:24:39,984
he freaks out,

5158
02:24:40,110 --> 02:24:40,381
you know,

5159
02:24:40,381 --> 02:24:43,290
that kind of paradigm or
that kind of whatever,

5160
02:24:43,350 --> 02:24:44,183
whatever that is.

5161
02:24:44,520 --> 02:24:45,600
So that's like a thing.

5162
02:24:45,750 --> 02:24:47,150
But on vine there's,

5163
02:24:47,151 --> 02:24:49,350
there's some channels that
are dedicated to that.

5164
02:24:49,380 --> 02:24:50,213
Like what I would do,

5165
02:24:50,440 --> 02:24:51,540
I don't know really,

5166
02:24:51,570 --> 02:24:52,081
but funny,

5167
02:24:52,081 --> 02:24:52,741
in a funny way,

5168
02:24:52,741 --> 02:24:53,574
whatever is skit,

5169
02:24:53,580 --> 02:24:55,270
I'm doing a terrible job of describing it.

5170
02:24:55,271 --> 02:24:56,310
You use vine all the time.

5171
02:24:56,311 --> 02:25:00,420
Like I was pretty much reviewing Spiderman
three when I was watching it using

5172
02:25:00,421 --> 02:25:03,700
vine and Instagram and stuff like
that while you were watching it.

5173
02:25:03,740 --> 02:25:05,130
So I think,

5174
02:25:05,131 --> 02:25:05,340
yeah,

5175
02:25:05,340 --> 02:25:10,020
I think there's an issue right now of
expectations and I think that when a

5176
02:25:10,021 --> 02:25:11,400
person logs on to Twitter,

5177
02:25:11,820 --> 02:25:14,110
they have obvious
expectations of what there's,

5178
02:25:14,130 --> 02:25:15,210
what's going to be there,

5179
02:25:15,270 --> 02:25:16,200
the context of it,

5180
02:25:16,650 --> 02:25:19,050
and I think that for right now,

5181
02:25:19,051 --> 02:25:23,260
youtube is synonymous with video right
now and it's going to be difficult for

5182
02:25:23,261 --> 02:25:25,450
any player at any length to
come in there and change it.

5183
02:25:26,040 --> 02:25:27,510
I started taking pictures,

5184
02:25:27,511 --> 02:25:29,940
tweets of drawings of a,

5185
02:25:29,941 --> 02:25:31,560
of writings rather than I made.

5186
02:25:31,590 --> 02:25:33,960
I just thought I was going to do it
for the rest of my tweets from now on.

5187
02:25:33,961 --> 02:25:37,020
It's just even a picture of shit that
I wrote down so people could see my

5188
02:25:37,021 --> 02:25:37,560
handwriting,

5189
02:25:37,560 --> 02:25:38,393
but I only did it once.

5190
02:25:38,490 --> 02:25:38,940
Yeah.

5191
02:25:38,940 --> 02:25:39,601
Well it was like,

5192
02:25:39,601 --> 02:25:40,434
this is stupid.

5193
02:25:41,380 --> 02:25:41,530
Well,

5194
02:25:41,530 --> 02:25:42,750
the way I look at a right thing,

5195
02:25:42,780 --> 02:25:43,531
well not only that,

5196
02:25:43,531 --> 02:25:48,030
but the problem is there that a lot of
what makes the web so good in finding

5197
02:25:48,031 --> 02:25:50,580
shit you care about is the
fact that text is searchable.

5198
02:25:50,700 --> 02:25:51,150
Yeah.

5199
02:25:51,150 --> 02:25:52,080
You take a picture,

5200
02:25:52,560 --> 02:25:53,460
all that data's gone.

5201
02:25:53,570 --> 02:25:54,260
That's true.

5202
02:25:54,260 --> 02:25:57,230
But what I was going to say
is how infuriating would
it be to people if you made

5203
02:25:57,231 --> 02:26:01,620
a youtube video of a bunch of shit you
wrote like page after page of things you

5204
02:26:01,630 --> 02:26:02,140
wrote.

5205
02:26:02,140 --> 02:26:03,740
That was the thing was,

5206
02:26:04,010 --> 02:26:07,160
is really the people
super depressed people.

5207
02:26:07,220 --> 02:26:08,100
Oh,

5208
02:26:08,530 --> 02:26:09,110
it says,

5209
02:26:09,110 --> 02:26:09,381
oh,

5210
02:26:09,381 --> 02:26:10,610
I see they don't have a voice.

5211
02:26:10,611 --> 02:26:11,900
And then you turn the page.

5212
02:26:12,080 --> 02:26:12,671
Oh,

5213
02:26:12,671 --> 02:26:13,504
ah,

5214
02:26:13,660 --> 02:26:14,330
yeah.

5215
02:26:14,330 --> 02:26:16,010
Did you ever see that one where a woman,

5216
02:26:16,250 --> 02:26:16,371
uh,

5217
02:26:16,371 --> 02:26:21,200
left a job and she wrote
this a the page after page,

5218
02:26:21,201 --> 02:26:23,570
like a tumbler thing of all these cards,

5219
02:26:23,750 --> 02:26:25,220
like shitting on her boss.

5220
02:26:25,590 --> 02:26:29,950
And then so the boss wrote
back and did the same forms.

5221
02:26:29,960 --> 02:26:30,260
Yeah,

5222
02:26:30,260 --> 02:26:34,220
I signed the form and she was dancing
around and shit to annihilated or yeah.

5223
02:26:34,370 --> 02:26:34,671
Yeah,

5224
02:26:34,671 --> 02:26:35,001
she will.

5225
02:26:35,001 --> 02:26:37,100
She was wearing like sexy
outfits and stuff like that.

5226
02:26:37,101 --> 02:26:38,870
And he was talking about
how fucking stupid she was.

5227
02:26:39,350 --> 02:26:41,750
Incompetent and a bad
employee and selfish.

5228
02:26:42,010 --> 02:26:42,910
That's interesting.

5229
02:26:43,090 --> 02:26:46,960
When precede people take old tech
and introduce it into a new format.

5230
02:26:47,860 --> 02:26:51,610
The reason that they're doing it
is because they're trying to imply,

5231
02:26:52,420 --> 02:26:55,120
I don't know if they try and
make it more serious than it is,

5232
02:26:55,121 --> 02:26:58,210
but ultimately I think it's because that
person is not the best at expressing

5233
02:26:58,211 --> 02:27:00,040
themselves in the real form.

5234
02:27:00,330 --> 02:27:00,571
Well,

5235
02:27:00,571 --> 02:27:03,720
that's weird because the original
version of that was Bob Dylan.

5236
02:27:04,470 --> 02:27:05,730
Dylan would that song,

5237
02:27:05,731 --> 02:27:08,190
what was that song that he did
that there was a music video,

5238
02:27:08,430 --> 02:27:12,270
an old Bob Dylan success did it.

5239
02:27:12,380 --> 02:27:13,100
I've seen it.

5240
02:27:13,100 --> 02:27:16,790
Do you think Bob Dylan was
great at expressing himself?

5241
02:27:16,940 --> 02:27:18,050
Oh yeah.

5242
02:27:18,260 --> 02:27:20,000
You don't think he was
great at expressing himself?

5243
02:27:20,020 --> 02:27:20,090
No.

5244
02:27:20,090 --> 02:27:20,270
No.

5245
02:27:20,270 --> 02:27:20,960
See,

5246
02:27:20,960 --> 02:27:25,960
but I appreciate abstract
a representation,

5247
02:27:26,480 --> 02:27:27,110
but it's,

5248
02:27:27,110 --> 02:27:29,570
it's not the same as sitting
in a room with somebody.

5249
02:27:29,690 --> 02:27:30,290
Right.

5250
02:27:30,290 --> 02:27:32,060
We never sat in a room with Bob Dylan.

5251
02:27:32,200 --> 02:27:32,920
That's true.

5252
02:27:32,920 --> 02:27:33,521
That's good point.

5253
02:27:33,521 --> 02:27:36,970
But that was his art form was
expressing himself through music,

5254
02:27:37,030 --> 02:27:37,900
did a great lyric,

5255
02:27:37,901 --> 02:27:38,830
a great job there.

5256
02:27:39,050 --> 02:27:39,490
You know,

5257
02:27:39,490 --> 02:27:40,210
and if you look at,

5258
02:27:40,210 --> 02:27:41,530
look at the lyrics and whatnot,

5259
02:27:41,560 --> 02:27:45,040
incredibly sophisticated and deep and
meaningful and all the rest of it.

5260
02:27:45,490 --> 02:27:46,510
But I think,

5261
02:27:46,570 --> 02:27:47,261
I don't know,

5262
02:27:47,261 --> 02:27:48,790
I'm drawing a separation myself.

5263
02:27:48,791 --> 02:27:52,570
I think art has always
been a way for those,

5264
02:27:53,290 --> 02:27:56,590
for people to communicate in a format
that's more comfortable for them.

5265
02:27:57,310 --> 02:27:57,940
You're going to go,

5266
02:27:57,940 --> 02:27:59,050
you're going to go to their party.

5267
02:27:59,051 --> 02:28:00,070
They're not going to come to yours.

5268
02:28:00,310 --> 02:28:01,870
Talking is something we all have to do.

5269
02:28:02,990 --> 02:28:03,560
Right.

5270
02:28:03,560 --> 02:28:04,130
You know it's,

5271
02:28:04,130 --> 02:28:08,000
it's interesting as well is if you
went back to Bob Dylan's heyday,

5272
02:28:08,100 --> 02:28:11,270
you went to the 60s and the 70s and said,

5273
02:28:11,870 --> 02:28:12,111
okay,

5274
02:28:12,111 --> 02:28:15,560
we're going to make short films where
you just talk about shit and then people

5275
02:28:15,561 --> 02:28:17,540
could take it and watch it and be like,

5276
02:28:17,610 --> 02:28:19,070
it seems it seems brutal,

5277
02:28:19,071 --> 02:28:19,460
right?

5278
02:28:19,460 --> 02:28:20,293
He's terrible.

5279
02:28:20,780 --> 02:28:22,130
It like why would rather just

5280
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:22,821
do a song?

5281
02:28:22,821 --> 02:28:23,091
It's like,

5282
02:28:23,091 --> 02:28:24,020
why would we want our,

5283
02:28:24,080 --> 02:28:26,000
why would we want our
Bob Dylan in that form?

5284
02:28:26,210 --> 02:28:28,190
But it's the same for
celebrities nowadays.

5285
02:28:28,310 --> 02:28:32,290
It's like once upon a time
a celebrity was like vapor.

5286
02:28:32,300 --> 02:28:33,890
Like what are they doing
in their spare time now?

5287
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:35,990
Charlie Sheen arguing with his ex wife on.

5288
02:28:36,540 --> 02:28:37,160
Yeah,

5289
02:28:37,160 --> 02:28:37,993
exactly.

5290
02:28:38,030 --> 02:28:39,020
Do they eat cheerios?

5291
02:28:39,021 --> 02:28:39,770
Like what is like,

5292
02:28:39,770 --> 02:28:40,603
are they real?

5293
02:28:42,090 --> 02:28:43,320
You know,

5294
02:28:43,520 --> 02:28:44,570
but now it's,

5295
02:28:44,571 --> 02:28:49,571
this exposure in so many ways has forced
them to be real people at for us and we

5296
02:28:49,881 --> 02:28:50,810
can shit all over them,

5297
02:28:51,440 --> 02:28:51,940
you know?

5298
02:28:51,940 --> 02:28:53,770
Well this shitting all over him also.

5299
02:28:53,890 --> 02:28:54,723
We have the access

5300
02:28:54,800 --> 02:28:55,190
shit.

5301
02:28:55,190 --> 02:28:55,910
That's right.

5302
02:28:55,910 --> 02:28:56,331
That's right.

5303
02:28:56,331 --> 02:28:56,501
And,

5304
02:28:56,501 --> 02:28:57,021
and again,

5305
02:28:57,021 --> 02:28:59,750
it's much like the traditional
brand thing coming into youtube.

5306
02:28:59,751 --> 02:29:04,250
It's like the traditional people have to
come to our party now you see they just

5307
02:29:04,251 --> 02:29:05,660
got a profile like anyone else.

5308
02:29:05,750 --> 02:29:06,261
Well sort of.

5309
02:29:06,261 --> 02:29:08,120
And then there's people
that exploit that opening.

5310
02:29:08,121 --> 02:29:10,310
Like if you have a good article,

5311
02:29:10,520 --> 02:29:15,520
a TMZ article about Kim and Kanye
that is essentially a portal for hate.

5312
02:29:15,950 --> 02:29:16,783
That's all that is.

5313
02:29:17,090 --> 02:29:21,080
What that exists is you open
up the comments and then
just let the floodgates of

5314
02:29:21,081 --> 02:29:26,081
hell just open up on the photo of Kim and
Kanye kissing in front of some fucking

5315
02:29:26,301 --> 02:29:27,170
fountain somewhere.

5316
02:29:27,380 --> 02:29:32,380
So it's a fucked up to me that people
give a shit about that give a shit what I,

5317
02:29:32,751 --> 02:29:34,790
it's probably second only to porn.

5318
02:29:35,510 --> 02:29:36,200
Wow.

5319
02:29:36,200 --> 02:29:38,750
If you thought about like
the amount of internet space,

5320
02:29:38,751 --> 02:29:42,680
it's used to just shit on
random targets of hate.

5321
02:29:43,310 --> 02:29:46,550
Whether it's like some
ridiculous celebrities like
it used to be Paris Hilton

5322
02:29:46,850 --> 02:29:48,600
and that bitch just evaporated piece.

5323
02:29:48,601 --> 02:29:49,520
She vanished.

5324
02:29:49,760 --> 02:29:49,911
Well,

5325
02:29:49,911 --> 02:29:54,560
realize that piggy backing
on that is so fucking low.

5326
02:29:54,830 --> 02:29:58,340
Who the people that are commenting
or the people that are bald of it,

5327
02:29:58,550 --> 02:29:59,240
all of it.

5328
02:29:59,240 --> 02:29:59,421
Well,

5329
02:29:59,421 --> 02:30:02,180
the people that are making
it was TMZ or any of these.

5330
02:30:02,270 --> 02:30:04,070
They're making a lot of money and it's,

5331
02:30:04,071 --> 02:30:04,670
it's a,

5332
02:30:04,670 --> 02:30:05,271
if you ever seen,

5333
02:30:05,271 --> 02:30:05,870
there's a,

5334
02:30:05,870 --> 02:30:08,120
Morgan Spurlock has that show inside.

5335
02:30:08,121 --> 02:30:08,500
Man.

5336
02:30:08,500 --> 02:30:09,333
You ever see that show?

5337
02:30:09,350 --> 02:30:09,561
No.

5338
02:30:09,561 --> 02:30:10,700
I've seen these documentaries though.

5339
02:30:10,760 --> 02:30:11,480
Good show.

5340
02:30:11,480 --> 02:30:12,110
Um,

5341
02:30:12,110 --> 02:30:16,820
it's on CNN and he does a bunch
of different jobs like in just,

5342
02:30:16,821 --> 02:30:20,570
we'll go inside and see what it's
like to be different people's lives.

5343
02:30:21,110 --> 02:30:24,830
And one of them he did was he hung out
with a bunch of Paparazzi and the way

5344
02:30:24,831 --> 02:30:25,461
they see it,

5345
02:30:25,461 --> 02:30:25,791
it's like,

5346
02:30:25,791 --> 02:30:26,031
look,

5347
02:30:26,031 --> 02:30:26,900
this is a Gig.

5348
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:27,740
You know,

5349
02:30:27,740 --> 02:30:28,820
you wanted to be famous.

5350
02:30:29,670 --> 02:30:30,210
You know what?

5351
02:30:30,210 --> 02:30:31,290
Let's leave them out.

5352
02:30:31,590 --> 02:30:36,180
Let's go boil it down all the way to the
consumption because that's what drives

5353
02:30:36,270 --> 02:30:37,020
everything else.

5354
02:30:37,020 --> 02:30:37,380
That's,

5355
02:30:37,380 --> 02:30:39,090
that's the fuel,

5356
02:30:39,150 --> 02:30:39,870
right?

5357
02:30:39,870 --> 02:30:40,350
Why is it,

5358
02:30:40,350 --> 02:30:42,630
why is that something that
human beings want to consume?

5359
02:30:42,660 --> 02:30:43,770
Because it's fascinating.

5360
02:30:43,800 --> 02:30:45,690
Why is that fast as stupid as fuck.

5361
02:30:46,800 --> 02:30:47,633
Cause why?

5362
02:30:47,700 --> 02:30:49,110
Why does it matter?

5363
02:30:50,160 --> 02:30:53,250
Why does it matter what Kim Kardashians
and Kanye West are doing it?

5364
02:30:53,460 --> 02:30:56,500
It's actually been studied
by sociologists and they,

5365
02:30:56,600 --> 02:31:01,600
our conclusion is that gossip was a way
of keeping monitoring behavior and the

5366
02:31:03,690 --> 02:31:08,690
sort of reactions to our own behavior
and how people perceived us in the

5367
02:31:09,001 --> 02:31:09,780
community.

5368
02:31:09,780 --> 02:31:12,720
And it's sort of to elevate
themselves by trial and error.

5369
02:31:12,721 --> 02:31:13,800
Where we talked about earlier,

5370
02:31:13,801 --> 02:31:15,090
learning from your mistakes.

5371
02:31:15,360 --> 02:31:19,140
Well those mistakes sometimes
or socially being ostracized,

5372
02:31:19,500 --> 02:31:20,170
your act,

5373
02:31:20,170 --> 02:31:22,230
so your words or you know,

5374
02:31:22,231 --> 02:31:24,360
those things existed in communities.

5375
02:31:24,361 --> 02:31:25,610
Kind of keep people in check.

5376
02:31:25,920 --> 02:31:28,710
Well now we live in communities where
I've been in the same house for 10 years.

5377
02:31:28,711 --> 02:31:30,110
I barely know my fucking neighbors,

5378
02:31:30,120 --> 02:31:30,361
dude.

5379
02:31:30,361 --> 02:31:31,410
I mean barely.

5380
02:31:31,460 --> 02:31:32,160
I wait.

5381
02:31:32,160 --> 02:31:35,070
There's a few people in my neighborhood
that I'm pretty friendly with that I've

5382
02:31:35,071 --> 02:31:37,260
seen over the Times that
we've had conversations.

5383
02:31:37,261 --> 02:31:38,790
But we don't hang out.

5384
02:31:39,030 --> 02:31:39,541
We don't want,

5385
02:31:39,541 --> 02:31:42,330
no one's knocking on my door
and coming over for dinners.

5386
02:31:42,510 --> 02:31:43,140
You know this,

5387
02:31:43,140 --> 02:31:48,140
we have these weird environments that we
live in now and we have this desire to

5388
02:31:48,751 --> 02:31:50,310
find out what everyone else is up to.

5389
02:31:50,580 --> 02:31:53,670
And the only real way to
do that is through gossip.

5390
02:31:53,940 --> 02:31:55,410
And when there's no gossip,

5391
02:31:55,560 --> 02:31:58,560
you just go to the gossip
of the kings and Queens,

5392
02:31:58,770 --> 02:32:01,110
who is the kings and Queens movie stars,

5393
02:32:01,140 --> 02:32:02,030
Rock Stars,

5394
02:32:02,050 --> 02:32:05,670
those people that you see in her low
fees and form of communication though.

5395
02:32:05,920 --> 02:32:06,180
Well,

5396
02:32:06,180 --> 02:32:07,470
but so compelling.

5397
02:32:07,500 --> 02:32:08,490
So then it becomes,

5398
02:32:08,491 --> 02:32:08,761
well,

5399
02:32:08,761 --> 02:32:09,780
if it's so low,

5400
02:32:09,870 --> 02:32:11,520
why do so many people engage in it?

5401
02:32:11,521 --> 02:32:12,540
What is the draw?

5402
02:32:12,541 --> 02:32:13,290
What is the,

5403
02:32:13,290 --> 02:32:18,290
there's some sort of base human
attraction to finding out what tiger woods

5404
02:32:19,980 --> 02:32:22,680
texted to all those freaky bitches on his,

5405
02:32:22,681 --> 02:32:22,940
uh,

5406
02:32:22,940 --> 02:32:23,773
his hit list.

5407
02:32:23,930 --> 02:32:24,240
You know,

5408
02:32:24,240 --> 02:32:26,540
there's some strange thing
to finding out about,

5409
02:32:26,550 --> 02:32:29,130
I guess it makes people feel
better about themselves.

5410
02:32:29,150 --> 02:32:31,530
It seems excited finding out some dirt.

5411
02:32:31,830 --> 02:32:32,191
Right?

5412
02:32:32,191 --> 02:32:33,960
But at the same time
they can point and say,

5413
02:32:33,961 --> 02:32:34,950
you're the fucked up one,

5414
02:32:34,951 --> 02:32:36,060
so my life's more normal,

5415
02:32:36,061 --> 02:32:36,900
or my life's better.

5416
02:32:36,930 --> 02:32:37,021
Well,

5417
02:32:37,021 --> 02:32:38,600
it takes the focus on the fucked up.

5418
02:32:38,610 --> 02:32:39,031
They never,

5419
02:32:39,031 --> 02:32:43,230
when Britney spears was like imploding
or whatever it was head and went navy and

5420
02:32:43,231 --> 02:32:45,420
it was an opportunity for
people to point and say,

5421
02:32:45,421 --> 02:32:46,740
look how fucking crazy she is.

5422
02:32:46,770 --> 02:32:49,340
The photos of her with a
fucking umbrella wielding it.

5423
02:32:49,350 --> 02:32:50,550
Photographers Agley.

5424
02:32:50,940 --> 02:32:51,480
Yeah,

5425
02:32:51,480 --> 02:32:52,010
yeah.

5426
02:32:52,010 --> 02:32:52,620
Oh,

5427
02:32:52,620 --> 02:32:54,150
definitely makes you,

5428
02:32:54,240 --> 02:32:56,130
especially when it's that bad.

5429
02:32:56,270 --> 02:33:00,090
When do you remember David Hasselhoff
has daughter released a video of him

5430
02:33:00,120 --> 02:33:01,590
unbelievably drunk,

5431
02:33:01,591 --> 02:33:02,401
like scrounging.

5432
02:33:02,401 --> 02:33:02,880
Yes,

5433
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:04,110
I do a hamburger.

5434
02:33:04,230 --> 02:33:06,510
I recall that it was so insane.

5435
02:33:06,800 --> 02:33:09,630
You see this poor fucking
side throws of sick.

5436
02:33:09,650 --> 02:33:14,310
I see shit like scrambling up food like
that and she shit like that as traps.

5437
02:33:14,370 --> 02:33:15,420
Like if I'm on the web,

5438
02:33:15,540 --> 02:33:16,830
that's like a bear trap to me.

5439
02:33:17,610 --> 02:33:18,720
I know it stuck in it.

5440
02:33:18,750 --> 02:33:20,850
You know that that bay link Bait and shit.

5441
02:33:20,950 --> 02:33:21,580
Yeah.

5442
02:33:21,580 --> 02:33:23,630
If you see the web,

5443
02:33:23,631 --> 02:33:28,631
he's consumed in these tidbits and all
you need to do is grip a p a person on

5444
02:33:28,741 --> 02:33:31,050
the lowest common denominator and you win.

5445
02:33:31,500 --> 02:33:36,500
And it's like if the consumers themselves
don't man the fuck up and see a trap

5446
02:33:37,141 --> 02:33:39,120
when it's there and not click on it,

5447
02:33:39,860 --> 02:33:40,110
you know,

5448
02:33:40,110 --> 02:33:42,610
I mean obviously it's,

5449
02:33:42,611 --> 02:33:44,550
it's obviously a
discussion that you're not,

5450
02:33:44,580 --> 02:33:45,810
you can't get to the bottom of,

5451
02:33:46,110 --> 02:33:49,590
but it's like you are
essentially supporting the
kind of shit you don't really,

5452
02:33:49,591 --> 02:33:50,250
like.

5453
02:33:50,250 --> 02:33:53,460
I was reading this thing on
pornography recently or watching,

5454
02:33:53,461 --> 02:33:55,380
this thing's a ted talk on pornography.

5455
02:33:55,381 --> 02:33:58,620
Somebody sent it to me on Twitter and
they said this guy is the biggest white

5456
02:33:58,621 --> 02:33:59,454
night ever.

5457
02:33:59,820 --> 02:34:03,840
And I expected it to be just like a
tumbler website were some dude was like

5458
02:34:03,990 --> 02:34:06,030
arguing about being a male
feminist or something.

5459
02:34:06,900 --> 02:34:07,890
Some along those lines.

5460
02:34:08,040 --> 02:34:11,910
But it was a guy who actually made these
like pretty intense detailed points

5461
02:34:11,911 --> 02:34:12,780
about what's the,

5462
02:34:12,781 --> 02:34:15,330
the real issue with watching pornography.

5463
02:34:15,900 --> 02:34:18,070
And it was pretty because it was

5464
02:34:18,070 --> 02:34:19,330
really in depth.

5465
02:34:19,400 --> 02:34:19,720
Hmm.

5466
02:34:19,720 --> 02:34:21,790
And he was talking about
a lot of shit that's,

5467
02:34:22,450 --> 02:34:23,080
you know,

5468
02:34:23,080 --> 02:34:26,620
pretty undeniable and uniquely undeniable.

5469
02:34:26,650 --> 02:34:29,560
Like one of the things he was
talking about is that the,

5470
02:34:29,920 --> 02:34:34,920
that a lot of sex in porn is nothing
like sex in real life in that there's no

5471
02:34:37,421 --> 02:34:42,050
hands and what he meant was
there's no caressing and massaging,

5472
02:34:42,070 --> 02:34:46,240
rubbing and holding and all the thing
that people do when they make love they,

5473
02:34:46,450 --> 02:34:47,201
they make love.

5474
02:34:47,201 --> 02:34:47,841
Notice how I said that,

5475
02:34:47,841 --> 02:34:48,674
and very sensitive.

5476
02:34:48,820 --> 02:34:52,060
Instead it's like the people that
are doing things at odd angles.

5477
02:34:52,120 --> 02:34:54,550
He was a little white in it for sure,

5478
02:34:54,700 --> 02:34:55,300
but there's a,

5479
02:34:55,300 --> 02:34:57,410
it's undeniable that when you take no,

5480
02:34:57,460 --> 02:35:01,060
don't just have this idea in your head
and it might be something wrong with

5481
02:35:01,061 --> 02:35:01,751
watching porn,

5482
02:35:01,751 --> 02:35:05,440
but have it so much so that you've
concocted a Ted talk and you know you're

5483
02:35:05,470 --> 02:35:08,740
presented yourself as
this moral alternative,

5484
02:35:08,920 --> 02:35:11,890
this moral and ethical alternative
to all the other men out there.

5485
02:35:11,891 --> 02:35:15,220
This is certainly like a
progressive brownie point,

5486
02:35:15,760 --> 02:35:18,310
sort of a pull of that initiative.

5487
02:35:18,960 --> 02:35:23,560
Did something regarding the pornography
thing though that I think is interesting

5488
02:35:23,561 --> 02:35:28,561
and maybe a reason why from a discussion
standpoint there is something there is

5489
02:35:28,721 --> 02:35:32,110
because at once upon a time
the consumption of porn,

5490
02:35:32,170 --> 02:35:33,370
I dunno when I was a kid,

5491
02:35:33,371 --> 02:35:35,620
I guess I don't know
because I sorta missed it.

5492
02:35:36,400 --> 02:35:40,060
You had to physically go and
get it to video tape or for

5493
02:35:40,230 --> 02:35:41,020
end magazine.

5494
02:35:41,020 --> 02:35:41,980
I'll tell you son,

5495
02:35:42,100 --> 02:35:44,560
cause I was around back
then when I was young,

5496
02:35:44,650 --> 02:35:48,190
they had video stores and this was
before blockbuster even took off.

5497
02:35:48,340 --> 02:35:53,340
It was mom and pop video stores and you
would go to these local video stores and

5498
02:35:53,411 --> 02:35:53,681
you know,

5499
02:35:53,681 --> 02:35:55,540
I still have to watch
you walk into the bag.

5500
02:35:55,630 --> 02:35:57,730
Sometimes you have
memberships to these videos,

5501
02:35:57,731 --> 02:35:58,180
stores,

5502
02:35:58,180 --> 02:36:01,120
remember those and you had a card
and they would punch your card.

5503
02:36:01,121 --> 02:36:04,180
And every 10th video you've got
to fucking discount or free video.

5504
02:36:04,480 --> 02:36:05,313
Um,

5505
02:36:05,470 --> 02:36:05,771
there was,

5506
02:36:05,771 --> 02:36:06,040
uh,

5507
02:36:06,040 --> 02:36:11,040
like you would push beads aside or like
saloon doors and you would go into this

5508
02:36:12,251 --> 02:36:15,460
area and it was all chicks
and fucking ass isn't,

5509
02:36:15,620 --> 02:36:19,750
and mostly not like really hardcore
shit like you're seeing today.

5510
02:36:20,190 --> 02:36:23,140
Like they would actually
like the covers of these,

5511
02:36:23,650 --> 02:36:27,910
these videos would sort of be concocted
knowing that they were going to be

5512
02:36:27,911 --> 02:36:29,940
placed on a shelf somewhere.

5513
02:36:30,340 --> 02:36:34,660
It's so much could kind of just
get to as opposed to typing in,

5514
02:36:34,810 --> 02:36:35,051
you know,

5515
02:36:35,051 --> 02:36:38,740
suck my cock.com or whatever the hell it
is and you're going to go right there.

5516
02:36:38,770 --> 02:36:40,330
So you know what to expect.

5517
02:36:40,450 --> 02:36:43,600
American pornography
consumption pre-internet.

5518
02:36:43,710 --> 02:36:47,980
Post-Internet well I think it's a
lot like our gossip consumption.

5519
02:36:48,310 --> 02:36:49,600
We have access to it,

5520
02:36:49,630 --> 02:36:50,980
we're going to consume more of it.

5521
02:36:51,010 --> 02:36:52,900
But the amplification level on porn,

5522
02:36:52,901 --> 02:36:54,130
I think he's like nothing else.

5523
02:36:54,160 --> 02:36:55,330
I think it's like both of them.

5524
02:36:55,360 --> 02:36:59,170
I think both of them have massive
amplification levels because you access,

5525
02:36:59,200 --> 02:36:59,950
let's put it this way,

5526
02:36:59,950 --> 02:37:03,910
but you could always go to a grocery
store and walk out the door with a gossip

5527
02:37:03,911 --> 02:37:04,744
magazine.

5528
02:37:04,780 --> 02:37:06,340
Super easy access,

5529
02:37:06,600 --> 02:37:08,050
eat the saloon door thing.

5530
02:37:08,450 --> 02:37:09,400
I mean there's like what?

5531
02:37:09,401 --> 02:37:11,490
Two into every town and it's was,

5532
02:37:11,560 --> 02:37:13,540
it was in a corner somewhere.

5533
02:37:13,660 --> 02:37:14,261
That's true.

5534
02:37:14,261 --> 02:37:14,680
But it's,

5535
02:37:14,680 --> 02:37:16,790
but magazine is very finite,

5536
02:37:16,910 --> 02:37:17,210
you know?

5537
02:37:17,210 --> 02:37:19,040
Maybe there's two or three
of them on the shelf.

5538
02:37:19,070 --> 02:37:19,490
Yeah.

5539
02:37:19,490 --> 02:37:20,061
Your daughter.

5540
02:37:20,061 --> 02:37:22,640
When you get from front to back
and you had to stop consuming it.

5541
02:37:22,800 --> 02:37:26,120
There's not a lot of stuff there
aren't there are parallels there.

5542
02:37:26,210 --> 02:37:28,190
I mean I think probably
the pornography one,

5543
02:37:29,330 --> 02:37:31,210
I think both of them are
based on human incentive.

5544
02:37:31,220 --> 02:37:32,053
Fucking similar.

5545
02:37:32,150 --> 02:37:32,901
They're both based on,

5546
02:37:32,901 --> 02:37:35,420
so how about this gossip
is porn for girls?

5547
02:37:35,810 --> 02:37:36,643
For Women.

5548
02:37:37,250 --> 02:37:38,083
Huh?

5549
02:37:39,140 --> 02:37:40,790
But it's not I,

5550
02:37:41,960 --> 02:37:42,290
yeah,

5551
02:37:42,290 --> 02:37:43,740
I don't think it is pouring.

5552
02:37:44,200 --> 02:37:45,860
Well this is obviously
still porn for women,

5553
02:37:45,861 --> 02:37:46,130
but you know,

5554
02:37:46,130 --> 02:37:49,430
I'll tell you one thing you can be sure
of if there's a man who's really into

5555
02:37:49,431 --> 02:37:50,240
gossip,

5556
02:37:50,240 --> 02:37:51,650
that guy's a bitch.

5557
02:37:52,280 --> 02:37:53,360
That's a fact.

5558
02:37:53,361 --> 02:37:57,680
If there's a man out there who's really
into like this girl shoes or that girls

5559
02:37:57,681 --> 02:37:59,860
dress and look at her stupid car like

5560
02:38:00,910 --> 02:38:01,480
I think there's,

5561
02:38:01,480 --> 02:38:02,590
I think there's gossip.

5562
02:38:02,740 --> 02:38:05,830
I think guys and girls like gossip for
the same reason that like if you go to a

5563
02:38:05,831 --> 02:38:06,610
movie and you're,

5564
02:38:06,610 --> 02:38:08,170
you like Brad Pitt movies,

5565
02:38:08,620 --> 02:38:11,410
you also want to know what Brad
Pitt's doing it in real life.

5566
02:38:11,411 --> 02:38:12,790
Like is he getting,

5567
02:38:12,820 --> 02:38:13,810
doing drugs and,

5568
02:38:13,860 --> 02:38:14,840
but that's only if drink,

5569
02:38:14,850 --> 02:38:16,470
like someone who's a movie star.

5570
02:38:16,471 --> 02:38:19,560
When you talk about Kim and
Kim Kardashians and her family,

5571
02:38:19,561 --> 02:38:20,010
they don't,

5572
02:38:20,010 --> 02:38:21,090
they don't do anything.

5573
02:38:22,680 --> 02:38:26,940
They miss rappers ever later that he's a
recent addition to that fucking circus.

5574
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:28,560
I'm going to use this
opportunity to go for that.

5575
02:38:28,561 --> 02:38:28,711
Yeah,

5576
02:38:28,711 --> 02:38:29,250
please do.

5577
02:38:29,250 --> 02:38:32,310
Before that there was nothing.

5578
02:38:32,550 --> 02:38:34,050
I mean if you stop to think about it,

5579
02:38:34,051 --> 02:38:36,060
cheap contributed nothing.

5580
02:38:36,360 --> 02:38:39,120
All she was doing was
being a point of gossip.

5581
02:38:39,630 --> 02:38:40,620
So in that sense,

5582
02:38:40,621 --> 02:38:45,300
she's way bigger gossip star
than any Angelina Jolie's story.

5583
02:38:45,540 --> 02:38:46,021
You know the,

5584
02:38:46,021 --> 02:38:49,230
if you looked at the number of people
that are paid attention to Kim Kardashians

5585
02:38:49,410 --> 02:38:51,150
versus paying attention to Angelina Jolie,

5586
02:38:51,151 --> 02:38:55,350
I bet I'd be willing to better like
five or six to one and Kim's favorite.

5587
02:38:55,590 --> 02:39:00,590
So I think it's more of Oh look at her
and if you can do things to keep eyes on

5588
02:39:01,411 --> 02:39:01,980
you,

5589
02:39:01,980 --> 02:39:02,221
you,

5590
02:39:02,221 --> 02:39:03,300
that's your business.

5591
02:39:03,301 --> 02:39:06,840
Whether it's hate or love
your business is to keep that.

5592
02:39:07,020 --> 02:39:08,310
That's sort of weird.

5593
02:39:08,610 --> 02:39:10,170
Gossipy energy up.

5594
02:39:10,590 --> 02:39:11,160
Yeah.

5595
02:39:11,160 --> 02:39:11,550
Yeah.

5596
02:39:11,550 --> 02:39:11,911
I mean I,

5597
02:39:11,911 --> 02:39:14,250
I go to it every day
to watch because it's,

5598
02:39:14,420 --> 02:39:17,040
you go to watch TMZ and stuff like that.

5599
02:39:17,070 --> 02:39:17,461
I'll,

5600
02:39:17,461 --> 02:39:17,940
I love,

5601
02:39:17,940 --> 02:39:19,140
I love that shit.

5602
02:39:19,230 --> 02:39:20,760
Cause it's just like all my God,

5603
02:39:20,761 --> 02:39:21,700
look what happened here.

5604
02:39:21,701 --> 02:39:22,560
Look what happened there.

5605
02:39:22,561 --> 02:39:22,861
You know?

5606
02:39:22,861 --> 02:39:27,060
And it's just because you watch them on
TV and you watch them in movies and like

5607
02:39:27,061 --> 02:39:28,140
make believe world.

5608
02:39:28,410 --> 02:39:31,570
And so it's weird seeing them
outside of make believer of what the,

5609
02:39:31,590 --> 02:39:32,311
Oh shit.

5610
02:39:32,311 --> 02:39:33,720
Tom Cruise's got aids,

5611
02:39:33,780 --> 02:39:34,251
you know,

5612
02:39:34,251 --> 02:39:37,620
so I mean allegedly,

5613
02:39:38,310 --> 02:39:39,450
but that's not even true.

5614
02:39:41,150 --> 02:39:43,230
And where that big gold
medal around his neck,

5615
02:39:43,690 --> 02:39:44,011
by the way,

5616
02:39:44,011 --> 02:39:45,960
do you follow Yoko Ono on Twitter?

5617
02:39:46,180 --> 02:39:47,013
Of course.

5618
02:39:48,590 --> 02:39:49,170
Yeah,

5619
02:39:49,170 --> 02:39:50,003
of course.

5620
02:39:50,360 --> 02:39:50,751
Mammary.

5621
02:39:50,751 --> 02:39:51,620
Put it in a box,

5622
02:39:51,621 --> 02:39:54,050
burn the box and sprinkled
the ashes in a field.

5623
02:39:54,170 --> 02:39:56,840
Give some ashes to a friend
who shared the sadness.

5624
02:39:57,170 --> 02:39:57,990
Oh my God.

5625
02:39:57,990 --> 02:39:58,171
Yeah.

5626
02:39:58,171 --> 02:39:59,430
Your friend who had a sad memory.

5627
02:39:59,431 --> 02:40:00,450
Here's some ashes.

5628
02:40:00,451 --> 02:40:01,710
Like that's rude.

5629
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,660
The is 4.7 11 million

5630
02:40:04,660 --> 02:40:06,130
fucking Twitter followers.

5631
02:40:06,370 --> 02:40:07,600
That's hilarious.

5632
02:40:08,140 --> 02:40:10,270
That shows you how Twitter is crazy.

5633
02:40:10,490 --> 02:40:14,040
Yoga on a whole has more than 4
million Twitter followers because she

5634
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:16,170
used to fuck one of the
best musicians ever.

5635
02:40:17,090 --> 02:40:17,580
Imagine.

5636
02:40:17,580 --> 02:40:18,540
Malarious okay,

5637
02:40:18,560 --> 02:40:19,393
this one.

5638
02:40:19,410 --> 02:40:20,160
Uh,

5639
02:40:20,160 --> 02:40:23,520
imagine what would happen to
your room when you move away.

5640
02:40:23,610 --> 02:40:27,090
Imagine if there is anything in the room
that you could take with you when you

5641
02:40:27,091 --> 02:40:27,924
die.

5642
02:40:28,140 --> 02:40:28,800
Oh,

5643
02:40:28,800 --> 02:40:29,850
shut the fuck up.

5644
02:40:30,950 --> 02:40:31,651
Shut the fuck.

5645
02:40:31,651 --> 02:40:32,461
How many retweets,

5646
02:40:32,461 --> 02:40:33,294
how many retweets?

5647
02:40:33,480 --> 02:40:37,860
Call your answer phone every day and
complain and Moan about your life and

5648
02:40:37,861 --> 02:40:38,790
people around you.

5649
02:40:38,970 --> 02:40:40,770
Listen to the tape and
the end of the year.

5650
02:40:41,010 --> 02:40:41,843
What?

5651
02:40:42,360 --> 02:40:43,193
Wow.

5652
02:40:43,710 --> 02:40:45,540
She doesn't even know
how to say voicemail.

5653
02:40:45,660 --> 02:40:46,830
Call your answer phone.

5654
02:40:46,831 --> 02:40:47,431
That's not an answer.

5655
02:40:47,431 --> 02:40:48,001
Phone dummy.

5656
02:40:48,001 --> 02:40:49,080
It's God damn voicemail.

5657
02:40:49,410 --> 02:40:50,480
What planet are you live in?

5658
02:40:50,730 --> 02:40:53,220
You can't agree to the same descriptives.

5659
02:40:53,221 --> 02:40:54,900
Could that be a translation thing?

5660
02:40:54,901 --> 02:40:55,920
Maybe Watch,

5661
02:40:55,960 --> 02:40:57,120
she speaks English well,

5662
02:40:57,660 --> 02:40:58,450
sort of.

5663
02:40:58,450 --> 02:40:59,220
She speaks,

5664
02:40:59,220 --> 02:41:00,240
she's been around.

5665
02:41:00,420 --> 02:41:02,310
She's been speaking as
long as I've been alive.

5666
02:41:04,010 --> 02:41:04,843
Yeah,

5667
02:41:05,260 --> 02:41:07,890
but people never really
fully grab it if they didn't,

5668
02:41:08,070 --> 02:41:08,670
you know,

5669
02:41:08,670 --> 02:41:12,360
I don't understand how people could
be in this country for so long and

5670
02:41:12,361 --> 02:41:17,361
communicate with like I have people in
my life that I know that work in certain

5671
02:41:17,521 --> 02:41:19,980
places that I visit that
speak Spanish mostly.

5672
02:41:20,010 --> 02:41:20,220
Yeah.

5673
02:41:20,220 --> 02:41:24,120
And I've been communicating with them for
years and they still don't know how to

5674
02:41:24,121 --> 02:41:24,954
talk English.

5675
02:41:25,020 --> 02:41:25,853
I've met the like,

5676
02:41:26,070 --> 02:41:27,510
how hard is it man?

5677
02:41:27,630 --> 02:41:29,160
Is it that fucking hard?

5678
02:41:29,310 --> 02:41:32,310
My daughter's four and I can talk to her.

5679
02:41:32,430 --> 02:41:34,350
I've known you for 15 fucking years.

5680
02:41:34,351 --> 02:41:36,420
I've been coming to this place
and I still can't understand.

5681
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:40,230
That exposes this thing we
were talking about earlier,

5682
02:41:40,231 --> 02:41:45,231
but how when you're young you have a cape
capabilities to learn that will never

5683
02:41:45,451 --> 02:41:46,470
be replicated again.

5684
02:41:46,500 --> 02:41:49,470
That's not true either because I know
people that have picked up languages late

5685
02:41:49,471 --> 02:41:51,570
into their fifties and
they're fucking awesome at it.

5686
02:41:52,350 --> 02:41:52,921
I know people,

5687
02:41:52,921 --> 02:41:54,500
there's always going to be outliers,

5688
02:41:54,501 --> 02:41:55,590
so I was going to be special people,

5689
02:41:55,591 --> 02:41:57,860
but the average immigrant is,

5690
02:41:57,910 --> 02:42:01,770
he's never going to sound like a
fluent person who grew up here.

5691
02:42:01,800 --> 02:42:02,071
Yeah,

5692
02:42:02,071 --> 02:42:06,360
but that's mostly because they keep
themselves in communities that are other

5693
02:42:06,361 --> 02:42:10,500
immigrants and they speak their native
language and I know they don't attempt to

5694
02:42:10,501 --> 02:42:10,861
do it,

5695
02:42:10,861 --> 02:42:14,850
but if you immerse yourself in whatever
culture is Spanish culture and want to

5696
02:42:14,851 --> 02:42:15,810
learn how to speak Spanish,

5697
02:42:15,811 --> 02:42:16,110
right.

5698
02:42:16,110 --> 02:42:19,500
I know people that have learned in their
adulthood learn how to speak Spanish.

5699
02:42:19,501 --> 02:42:20,910
They speak perfect Spanish.

5700
02:42:21,210 --> 02:42:22,560
They just chose to do it.

5701
02:42:22,561 --> 02:42:24,240
It's not impossible to do.

5702
02:42:24,241 --> 02:42:24,630
It's like,

5703
02:42:24,630 --> 02:42:25,980
it's all just a matter of focus.

5704
02:42:26,130 --> 02:42:29,370
If you can get good at swimming
into your thirties very few.

5705
02:42:29,680 --> 02:42:32,910
You'll see very few Western people
learn how to speak Asian languages.

5706
02:42:33,090 --> 02:42:33,361
Right.

5707
02:42:33,361 --> 02:42:38,361
But I think that is more of a time and
interest thing than it is of an ability.

5708
02:42:38,660 --> 02:42:39,000
Yeah.

5709
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:40,110
I sense a challenge here.

5710
02:42:40,500 --> 02:42:41,311
I'm not doing it.

5711
02:42:41,311 --> 02:42:42,990
I have no time and I have no interest.

5712
02:42:43,230 --> 02:42:43,531
See,

5713
02:42:43,531 --> 02:42:44,640
I just sort of prove my point.

5714
02:42:45,180 --> 02:42:45,361
Well,

5715
02:42:45,361 --> 02:42:45,631
yeah,

5716
02:42:45,631 --> 02:42:46,830
but I don't know.

5717
02:42:46,850 --> 02:42:49,050
I think a lot of people like
to walk around to and say,

5718
02:42:49,051 --> 02:42:49,231
Hey,

5719
02:42:49,231 --> 02:42:51,180
I learned another language
and who's testing it?

5720
02:42:51,181 --> 02:42:52,230
I'm not testing their theory.

5721
02:42:52,231 --> 02:42:52,471
I'll go,

5722
02:42:52,471 --> 02:42:52,771
okay,

5723
02:42:52,771 --> 02:42:53,101
fine.

5724
02:42:53,101 --> 02:42:53,460
You can,

5725
02:42:53,460 --> 02:42:55,560
you can tell somebody you're
hungry in another language.

5726
02:42:55,561 --> 02:42:55,801
Good.

5727
02:42:55,801 --> 02:42:56,634
Great.

5728
02:42:56,730 --> 02:42:57,061
Who's,

5729
02:42:57,061 --> 02:42:58,680
who's really patrolling that?

5730
02:42:58,920 --> 02:42:59,610
What does it commit?

5731
02:42:59,610 --> 02:43:00,690
Canadian comedian,

5732
02:43:00,691 --> 02:43:01,650
I don't know his name,

5733
02:43:01,651 --> 02:43:02,041
but uh,

5734
02:43:02,041 --> 02:43:03,720
he learned Chinese,

5735
02:43:04,020 --> 02:43:05,000
learned Mandarin.

5736
02:43:05,240 --> 02:43:06,073
It was,

5737
02:43:06,150 --> 02:43:10,530
and went to China and started doing
standup in Chinese and there was a video

5738
02:43:10,531 --> 02:43:11,470
that they put online.

5739
02:43:11,471 --> 02:43:12,760
It was fascinating

5740
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:14,110
because the white guy.

5741
02:43:14,170 --> 02:43:14,471
Yeah,

5742
02:43:14,471 --> 02:43:15,304
White Guy.

5743
02:43:15,390 --> 02:43:16,690
The accident was a main,

5744
02:43:17,200 --> 02:43:17,591
obviously,

5745
02:43:17,591 --> 02:43:19,360
I don't know whether or not
he's saying they're right,

5746
02:43:19,420 --> 02:43:20,750
but the bloody tone child,

5747
02:43:21,330 --> 02:43:24,790
and he was talking like he was from China.

5748
02:43:24,850 --> 02:43:25,331
I'm sure.

5749
02:43:25,331 --> 02:43:28,810
I mean if you're going to put somebody
in it into a test to figure out if

5750
02:43:28,811 --> 02:43:30,040
they're actually fluent in the language,

5751
02:43:30,041 --> 02:43:32,350
put him on a stage in front of a bunch
of people and see if he can make them

5752
02:43:32,351 --> 02:43:33,040
laugh.

5753
02:43:33,040 --> 02:43:33,311
You know?

5754
02:43:33,311 --> 02:43:33,571
Like if,

5755
02:43:33,571 --> 02:43:35,560
if the guy was able to put that together,

5756
02:43:35,561 --> 02:43:36,730
I'd say he's probably pretty fluent.

5757
02:43:36,890 --> 02:43:37,161
Well,

5758
02:43:37,161 --> 02:43:40,460
I think it was also like a situation
where he just recognized that there was a

5759
02:43:40,461 --> 02:43:42,500
big market that wasn't
being tapped into it.

5760
02:43:42,530 --> 02:43:42,770
Right?

5761
02:43:42,770 --> 02:43:44,540
Like here's millions of people.

5762
02:43:44,660 --> 02:43:46,160
They have this new freedom now.

5763
02:43:46,190 --> 02:43:47,023
Billions.

5764
02:43:47,150 --> 02:43:47,660
Yeah.

5765
02:43:47,660 --> 02:43:48,493
Billion.

5766
02:43:48,620 --> 02:43:50,450
How many billions are in China's one?

5767
02:43:50,540 --> 02:43:51,373
At least one,

5768
02:43:51,610 --> 02:43:52,100
right?

5769
02:43:52,100 --> 02:43:52,641
At least one.

5770
02:43:52,641 --> 02:43:52,910
Yeah.

5771
02:43:52,910 --> 02:43:57,050
So all these people that don't
have access to stand up comedy,

5772
02:43:57,290 --> 02:43:57,770
you know,

5773
02:43:57,770 --> 02:43:58,790
and their language really.

5774
02:43:58,791 --> 02:44:00,920
There's no such thing as
Chinese standup comedy.

5775
02:44:00,950 --> 02:44:02,510
I wouldn't say there's no such thing,

5776
02:44:02,511 --> 02:44:05,870
but it's certainly not nearly
as popular as English speaking.

5777
02:44:05,871 --> 02:44:07,130
Comedy isn't Canada.

5778
02:44:07,340 --> 02:44:10,200
So there's a lot of
Goddamn Canadian comedian.

5779
02:44:10,201 --> 02:44:10,851
She's like,

5780
02:44:10,851 --> 02:44:14,060
if you wanted to learn stand up comedy
and you wanted to perform it in Canada,

5781
02:44:14,270 --> 02:44:14,841
there's many,

5782
02:44:14,841 --> 02:44:15,021
many,

5783
02:44:15,021 --> 02:44:15,291
many,

5784
02:44:15,291 --> 02:44:16,370
many venues.

5785
02:44:16,400 --> 02:44:17,600
Many places do it of course,

5786
02:44:17,720 --> 02:44:19,940
but there's also many comedians.

5787
02:44:20,180 --> 02:44:23,360
Whereas if you wanted to
learn Chinese and just tap,

5788
02:44:23,361 --> 02:44:27,620
I mean maybe his motivational learning
Chinese was totally unrelated to his

5789
02:44:27,860 --> 02:44:29,940
doing standup and Jamie
might be just person.

5790
02:44:29,941 --> 02:44:32,630
Like my friend John was like
super intro into languages.

5791
02:44:32,631 --> 02:44:34,010
He spoke five different languages.

5792
02:44:34,011 --> 02:44:37,820
He just loved learning languages and he
would practice them with people that you

5793
02:44:37,821 --> 02:44:38,000
know,

5794
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:38,833
spoke it.

5795
02:44:38,900 --> 02:44:39,800
It could be that,

5796
02:44:40,040 --> 02:44:43,130
but also it's like the amount of
competition that you have over there.

5797
02:44:43,131 --> 02:44:44,090
It's probably none.

5798
02:44:44,540 --> 02:44:45,030
Yeah.

5799
02:44:45,030 --> 02:44:45,560
It doesn't help.

5800
02:44:45,560 --> 02:44:46,393
Advantage

5801
02:44:46,980 --> 02:44:49,220
usually advantage to being
white over there in general.

5802
02:44:49,250 --> 02:44:52,370
I know a couple of buddies went over
there to teach English in Korea mean it's

5803
02:44:52,371 --> 02:44:53,900
like you're a stud,

5804
02:44:53,990 --> 02:44:54,860
you know,

5805
02:44:54,900 --> 02:44:55,431
because you're the,

5806
02:44:55,431 --> 02:44:56,264
you're the guy.

5807
02:44:56,420 --> 02:44:56,871
You know what I mean?

5808
02:44:56,871 --> 02:44:59,330
You're the guy that they see on TV,

5809
02:44:59,331 --> 02:44:59,571
you know,

5810
02:44:59,571 --> 02:45:00,070
you're you,

5811
02:45:00,070 --> 02:45:00,311
you,

5812
02:45:00,311 --> 02:45:01,490
you're Tom Cruise for a minute.

5813
02:45:02,090 --> 02:45:02,840
Really?

5814
02:45:02,840 --> 02:45:03,111
Yeah,

5815
02:45:03,111 --> 02:45:05,910
because they're really homogenous society.

5816
02:45:05,911 --> 02:45:06,111
He's like,

5817
02:45:06,111 --> 02:45:06,921
you're walking around Japan,

5818
02:45:06,921 --> 02:45:08,870
you're not seeing this mixed,

5819
02:45:09,140 --> 02:45:11,750
this mix up of ethnicity that
you have in North America.

5820
02:45:11,780 --> 02:45:12,613
We have,

5821
02:45:12,770 --> 02:45:16,850
we have a very strange cultural experience
compared to the rest of the world.

5822
02:45:17,560 --> 02:45:17,891
Yeah,

5823
02:45:17,891 --> 02:45:19,060
that Kinda makes sense.

5824
02:45:19,550 --> 02:45:22,750
It kind of makes sense in the
fact that there's so much content.

5825
02:45:22,780 --> 02:45:23,470
Again,

5826
02:45:23,470 --> 02:45:25,180
that gets distributed by Americans,

5827
02:45:25,330 --> 02:45:26,980
but that's also why it's really crazy.

5828
02:45:26,981 --> 02:45:27,920
And Korea where they,

5829
02:45:27,970 --> 02:45:32,500
the amount of people getting surgery
to change their appearance to a western

5830
02:45:32,501 --> 02:45:33,040
appearance.

5831
02:45:33,040 --> 02:45:33,820
That's crazy.

5832
02:45:33,820 --> 02:45:34,810
Whew.

5833
02:45:35,110 --> 02:45:35,591
Boy,

5834
02:45:35,591 --> 02:45:37,480
we've gotten into it a
few times on the podcast.

5835
02:45:37,481 --> 02:45:40,430
We won't get into it again cause he
shared a bunch of links and a bunch of

5836
02:45:40,480 --> 02:45:40,991
images,

5837
02:45:40,991 --> 02:45:45,991
but it's apparently as popular as like
braces and I don't like that people get

5838
02:45:46,511 --> 02:45:48,150
like some serious planning.

5839
02:45:48,180 --> 02:45:49,380
It's in India.

5840
02:45:49,381 --> 02:45:50,340
They trying to get lighter.

5841
02:45:50,440 --> 02:45:51,010
Yeah.

5842
02:45:51,010 --> 02:45:53,860
Well you know what they
use in a lot of those,

5843
02:45:53,861 --> 02:45:54,090
um,

5844
02:45:54,090 --> 02:45:56,020
those places they use some sort of a,

5845
02:45:56,021 --> 02:45:58,180
an injection that a,

5846
02:45:58,590 --> 02:45:59,410
again,

5847
02:45:59,410 --> 02:45:59,981
chemical,

5848
02:45:59,981 --> 02:46:00,730
hold on a second.

5849
02:46:00,730 --> 02:46:02,230
I've said it before and I know what it is.

5850
02:46:02,231 --> 02:46:03,370
Halapens they do it.

5851
02:46:03,371 --> 02:46:03,681
Yeah,

5852
02:46:03,681 --> 02:46:03,920
yeah,

5853
02:46:03,920 --> 02:46:04,211
yeah,

5854
02:46:04,211 --> 02:46:04,571
yeah.

5855
02:46:04,571 --> 02:46:05,860
Lighter skin.

5856
02:46:06,100 --> 02:46:07,210
I forget what it's called.

5857
02:46:07,450 --> 02:46:10,010
It's actually also an amino
or something like that.

5858
02:46:10,240 --> 02:46:10,521
Yeah.

5859
02:46:10,521 --> 02:46:10,920
But it's,

5860
02:46:10,920 --> 02:46:11,541
it's harmful.

5861
02:46:11,541 --> 02:46:12,374
Right?

5862
02:46:12,500 --> 02:46:12,921
Um,

5863
02:46:12,921 --> 02:46:13,161
it's,

5864
02:46:13,161 --> 02:46:15,860
it's actually a good thing for you.

5865
02:46:15,861 --> 02:46:17,030
It's like healthy.

5866
02:46:17,080 --> 02:46:17,390
Um,

5867
02:46:17,390 --> 02:46:21,470
if you take it like as a dietary
supplement with the fuck is it called

5868
02:46:21,650 --> 02:46:23,540
Glutathione Glutathione,

5869
02:46:23,810 --> 02:46:28,810
which is a glutathione is what
is it I'm originally used for,

5870
02:46:30,021 --> 02:46:31,370
I forget what it's originally used for,

5871
02:46:31,520 --> 02:46:36,520
but it's also been shown to aid in
the body's absorption of alcohol.

5872
02:46:36,980 --> 02:46:38,930
So a Dr. Mark Gordon,

5873
02:46:38,931 --> 02:46:43,250
who had been on my podcast before told
me that it would greatly decrease the

5874
02:46:43,251 --> 02:46:45,650
effect that alcohol has on your body.

5875
02:46:45,910 --> 02:46:50,910
That glue to thigh own ha helps
in some way to digest alcohol.

5876
02:46:51,440 --> 02:46:53,300
It's an antioxidant and plants,

5877
02:46:53,301 --> 02:46:53,811
animals,

5878
02:46:53,811 --> 02:46:56,030
fungi and some bacteria,

5879
02:46:56,230 --> 02:46:56,570
uh,

5880
02:46:56,570 --> 02:47:01,570
preventing damage to important cellular
components caused by reactive oxygen

5881
02:47:02,151 --> 02:47:04,790
species such as free
radicals and peroxides.

5882
02:47:05,510 --> 02:47:07,250
So I'm somehow or another,

5883
02:47:07,251 --> 02:47:11,870
they inject this stuff into their
body and it makes you think,

5884
02:47:12,180 --> 02:47:15,110
it makes you turn more pale and some,

5885
02:47:15,140 --> 02:47:16,480
some strange weather and stuff.

5886
02:47:16,490 --> 02:47:17,330
Michael Jackson was on,

5887
02:47:18,500 --> 02:47:21,680
I don't know what the fuck they
do and actually have pills too.

5888
02:47:23,270 --> 02:47:24,103
I Dunno.

5889
02:47:24,590 --> 02:47:26,150
Skin whitening at home.

5890
02:47:27,170 --> 02:47:28,640
It was a video as a video,

5891
02:47:28,641 --> 02:47:29,690
how to Whiten your skin.

5892
02:47:30,080 --> 02:47:30,980
After eight weeks,

5893
02:47:30,981 --> 02:47:35,270
I managed to get my skin a few turns
wider and also got rid of my freckles.

5894
02:47:35,300 --> 02:47:35,661
Whoa.

5895
02:47:35,661 --> 02:47:36,381
What else are you doing?

5896
02:47:36,381 --> 02:47:37,340
What are you doing to your eyes?

5897
02:47:37,760 --> 02:47:38,361
What you're doing?

5898
02:47:38,361 --> 02:47:39,590
Your fucking peel rain.

5899
02:47:39,830 --> 02:47:40,730
What's going on there?

5900
02:47:41,720 --> 02:47:42,553
I Dunno man.

5901
02:47:42,950 --> 02:47:43,431
It's like that's a,

5902
02:47:43,431 --> 02:47:48,431
that's a really far into the spectrum
kind of scenario in which you can,

5903
02:47:50,090 --> 02:47:54,020
you can immediately see the western
influence on the rest of the world in a

5904
02:47:54,021 --> 02:47:54,860
physical way.

5905
02:47:54,910 --> 02:47:55,061
Well,

5906
02:47:55,061 --> 02:47:56,260
how about people that Tan though?

5907
02:47:56,850 --> 02:47:58,480
What about people that get nutty and they,

5908
02:47:58,660 --> 02:48:00,490
they don't feel comfortable
unless they're super,

5909
02:48:00,491 --> 02:48:01,870
Super Tan it.

5910
02:48:01,871 --> 02:48:02,500
That's,

5911
02:48:02,500 --> 02:48:04,660
is that how many people are into that?

5912
02:48:04,810 --> 02:48:05,610
A lot.

5913
02:48:05,610 --> 02:48:05,801
Yeah.

5914
02:48:05,801 --> 02:48:07,710
I remember that Tam Ladies Tanning.

5915
02:48:07,830 --> 02:48:09,690
Remember that Tan lady that was on TV?

5916
02:48:09,840 --> 02:48:12,300
She was like insanely dark.

5917
02:48:12,800 --> 02:48:13,001
Yeah,

5918
02:48:13,001 --> 02:48:14,820
so it took her daughter
tanning and burned.

5919
02:48:14,821 --> 02:48:16,050
Her daughter do.

5920
02:48:16,290 --> 02:48:19,440
Is there such a thing as white people
trying to look like some other race?

5921
02:48:19,650 --> 02:48:22,050
There's such a thing as white people
trying to look darker for sure.

5922
02:48:22,080 --> 02:48:22,711
Well darker,

5923
02:48:22,711 --> 02:48:24,460
but you know what I mean.

5924
02:48:24,461 --> 02:48:27,090
Like I surgeries or I
fuck I guess everyone,

5925
02:48:27,120 --> 02:48:30,270
well Brazilian guy just got an
operation recently to look Korean.

5926
02:48:30,540 --> 02:48:31,410
Get the fuck out of here.

5927
02:48:31,550 --> 02:48:31,981
Yeah,

5928
02:48:31,981 --> 02:48:33,090
it was big news piece.

5929
02:48:33,230 --> 02:48:33,670
Wow.

5930
02:48:33,670 --> 02:48:36,600
But people on the planet,

5931
02:48:36,601 --> 02:48:39,930
I guess every for sure everyone's
tried something only they tried it.

5932
02:48:39,931 --> 02:48:41,250
There's probably a forum about it.

5933
02:48:41,490 --> 02:48:42,060
Reddit sub.

5934
02:48:42,060 --> 02:48:42,893
Yeah.

5935
02:48:44,580 --> 02:48:46,140
Nasty look.

5936
02:48:46,141 --> 02:48:46,810
People are,

5937
02:48:46,810 --> 02:48:48,960
and also it's like what
we're talking about before,

5938
02:48:48,961 --> 02:48:50,040
there's a lot of people that are just not,

5939
02:48:50,280 --> 02:48:51,660
they're not comfortable with who they are.

5940
02:48:51,720 --> 02:48:51,931
Yeah.

5941
02:48:51,931 --> 02:48:54,810
So they think that maybe if I
look Korean I'd feel better.

5942
02:48:55,110 --> 02:48:56,940
Maybe I suppose a few shades whiter,

5943
02:48:57,240 --> 02:48:58,020
I'd feel better.

5944
02:48:58,020 --> 02:48:58,853
Right.

5945
02:48:59,290 --> 02:49:04,290
I think it gets particularly strange or
interesting when it's a huge group of

5946
02:49:05,911 --> 02:49:07,200
people that are doing it right.

5947
02:49:07,201 --> 02:49:08,034
I mean when you have,

5948
02:49:08,280 --> 02:49:09,210
when you have a trend,

5949
02:49:09,570 --> 02:49:10,620
when it sort of changes.

5950
02:49:11,390 --> 02:49:11,601
Yeah.

5951
02:49:11,601 --> 02:49:13,430
And that's also what we're talking about.

5952
02:49:13,431 --> 02:49:15,290
It's like where's the content coming from?

5953
02:49:15,291 --> 02:49:16,520
Most of it's from the West.

5954
02:49:16,530 --> 02:49:17,350
So this,

5955
02:49:17,350 --> 02:49:17,600
these,

5956
02:49:17,600 --> 02:49:21,530
these features is Brad Pitt face that
you're seeing on your big screen over and

5957
02:49:21,531 --> 02:49:22,141
over again.

5958
02:49:22,141 --> 02:49:23,660
And sort of making you want,

5959
02:49:23,690 --> 02:49:25,820
why are my eyes so small?

5960
02:49:27,520 --> 02:49:30,540
But the physical
manifestation of influence,

5961
02:49:30,690 --> 02:49:32,280
the physical manifestation.

5962
02:49:32,310 --> 02:49:32,820
Wow.

5963
02:49:32,820 --> 02:49:35,610
But isn't it all the physical
manifestation of influence
when it comes to like

5964
02:49:35,760 --> 02:49:36,870
cultural ideas?

5965
02:49:37,750 --> 02:49:38,790
What do you choose to wear?

5966
02:49:38,791 --> 02:49:39,530
What are your clothes?

5967
02:49:39,530 --> 02:49:40,920
How about you put a plate in your lip?

5968
02:49:40,950 --> 02:49:41,190
Who,

5969
02:49:41,190 --> 02:49:42,180
how'd that get started?

5970
02:49:42,330 --> 02:49:43,860
How you got to bone through your nose?

5971
02:49:43,920 --> 02:49:45,690
Who the fuck else has a
violence with their nose?

5972
02:49:45,990 --> 02:49:46,830
Is that your thing?

5973
02:49:46,920 --> 02:49:47,570
You the only guy?

5974
02:49:47,570 --> 02:49:47,820
No,

5975
02:49:47,820 --> 02:49:48,570
it's a tradition.

5976
02:49:48,570 --> 02:49:48,741
Well,

5977
02:49:48,741 --> 02:49:49,410
were the fun.

5978
02:49:49,410 --> 02:49:49,951
We look great.

5979
02:49:49,951 --> 02:49:50,710
We have bones in their nose.

5980
02:49:50,710 --> 02:49:51,870
You do not look great.

5981
02:49:51,900 --> 02:49:52,733
Come here.

5982
02:49:52,830 --> 02:49:53,041
Yeah.

5983
02:49:53,041 --> 02:49:56,040
So ultimately we all do things because
of other people and what they're doing.

5984
02:49:56,160 --> 02:49:56,670
Well there was

5985
02:49:56,670 --> 02:50:00,270
thing on this television show
where this guy was going to,

5986
02:50:00,310 --> 02:50:03,830
this guy was going to Africa and um,

5987
02:50:03,870 --> 02:50:08,870
he was visiting with these people that
are regularly being around crocodiles and

5988
02:50:09,631 --> 02:50:14,180
they have these markings that they
see the scar there skin in the form of

5989
02:50:14,190 --> 02:50:19,190
crocodile crocodile ridges and they have
across their bodies really crazy shit.

5990
02:50:19,831 --> 02:50:20,161
And they,

5991
02:50:20,161 --> 02:50:22,770
they sort of mimic the
skin of a crocodile.

5992
02:50:22,890 --> 02:50:23,370
Whoa.

5993
02:50:23,370 --> 02:50:23,970
Yeah.

5994
02:50:23,970 --> 02:50:24,570
What's the,

5995
02:50:24,570 --> 02:50:25,100
what?

5996
02:50:25,100 --> 02:50:29,910
Just what I'm coming of age thing with
men and they do this and it sort of

5997
02:50:29,911 --> 02:50:31,890
represents strength and
they cover themselves.

5998
02:50:31,891 --> 02:50:32,160
This,

5999
02:50:32,160 --> 02:50:33,420
these crocodiles scars.

6000
02:50:33,820 --> 02:50:38,070
It was so weird to look at these key
Lloyd scars all around this guy's body and

6001
02:50:38,071 --> 02:50:40,560
this somehow or another become
a part of their culture,

6002
02:50:40,890 --> 02:50:45,890
like war paint or weird facial pain or
how about what we think of as normal when

6003
02:50:47,071 --> 02:50:52,071
a woman wears ridiculous lipstick and
blue colored eyeliner and you know,

6004
02:50:52,600 --> 02:50:53,830
Lash to say,

6005
02:50:53,831 --> 02:50:56,500
I'm happy as hell that that's not us.

6006
02:50:57,030 --> 02:50:58,150
We don't have sex.

6007
02:50:58,770 --> 02:51:00,370
If you've ever watched it going down

6008
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:05,210
like a fucking assault,

6009
02:51:05,800 --> 02:51:08,170
like a woman's getting
beat up by her makeup,

6010
02:51:08,171 --> 02:51:09,130
your watch going down,

6011
02:51:09,131 --> 02:51:09,311
Bro,

6012
02:51:09,311 --> 02:51:10,144
it's hard to watch.

6013
02:51:11,200 --> 02:51:11,651
It is.

6014
02:51:11,651 --> 02:51:14,140
You can't just get out of
bed and get to your shit.

6015
02:51:14,440 --> 02:51:16,300
Can't just move on with your life.

6016
02:51:16,430 --> 02:51:17,770
Like I put no thought.

6017
02:51:17,800 --> 02:51:18,101
I mean,

6018
02:51:18,101 --> 02:51:18,341
not,

6019
02:51:18,341 --> 02:51:18,761
no.

6020
02:51:18,761 --> 02:51:21,580
I mean I got to look in the mirror and
make sure I'm not fucked up or for some

6021
02:51:21,581 --> 02:51:21,851
reason,

6022
02:51:21,851 --> 02:51:22,061
you know,

6023
02:51:22,061 --> 02:51:26,170
but the idea that there's
preparation just to leave the house,

6024
02:51:27,010 --> 02:51:29,230
facial preparation and

6025
02:51:29,470 --> 02:51:30,130
women,

6026
02:51:30,130 --> 02:51:33,460
if they don't have their makeup on and
another girl is around and she has her

6027
02:51:33,461 --> 02:51:34,031
makeup on,

6028
02:51:34,031 --> 02:51:34,930
they get like upset.

6029
02:51:35,150 --> 02:51:35,961
Oh my gosh,

6030
02:51:35,961 --> 02:51:38,950
how am I fucking makeup
on and put my makeup on?

6031
02:51:38,960 --> 02:51:42,300
You should've told me that she
has her makeup on crazy colors.

6032
02:51:42,301 --> 02:51:43,200
Like from space.

6033
02:51:43,590 --> 02:51:44,520
We'll get her eyes.

6034
02:51:44,580 --> 02:51:45,391
She closes her eyes.

6035
02:51:45,391 --> 02:51:46,224
She see the heavens.

6036
02:51:46,230 --> 02:51:48,240
She's winning in her eyelids.

6037
02:51:48,250 --> 02:51:49,230
Eight goddammit.

6038
02:51:49,231 --> 02:51:50,190
Her skin is perfect.

6039
02:51:50,191 --> 02:51:51,630
It's covered in fucking powder.

6040
02:51:51,700 --> 02:51:53,040
How is their skin colored?

6041
02:51:53,041 --> 02:51:53,820
Powder all over.

6042
02:51:53,820 --> 02:51:53,980
Yeah.

6043
02:51:53,980 --> 02:51:54,601
We lucked out,

6044
02:51:54,601 --> 02:51:54,751
man.

6045
02:51:54,751 --> 02:51:55,680
We let her nails.

6046
02:51:55,710 --> 02:52:00,710
We lucked out in all kinds of
areas except how about urinating?

6047
02:52:01,570 --> 02:52:02,050
Awesome.

6048
02:52:02,050 --> 02:52:03,730
Except we dine wore more often.

6049
02:52:03,920 --> 02:52:04,251
We,

6050
02:52:04,251 --> 02:52:04,451
uh,

6051
02:52:04,451 --> 02:52:04,781
we have,

6052
02:52:04,781 --> 02:52:06,400
jobs are far more dangerous.

6053
02:52:06,401 --> 02:52:07,990
We're more likely to be murdered.

6054
02:52:08,020 --> 02:52:08,620
Right.

6055
02:52:08,620 --> 02:52:09,840
A lot of shit that's not so hot.

6056
02:52:09,841 --> 02:52:10,140
Yeah,

6057
02:52:10,140 --> 02:52:10,590
no.

6058
02:52:10,590 --> 02:52:11,190
You know what?

6059
02:52:11,190 --> 02:52:13,830
You know what else you hadn't that
you have to be tough to a degree.

6060
02:52:14,130 --> 02:52:14,850
Like you think so,

6061
02:52:14,850 --> 02:52:15,331
well let's,

6062
02:52:15,331 --> 02:52:16,164
let's put it this way,

6063
02:52:16,280 --> 02:52:17,340
but let's say,

6064
02:52:17,460 --> 02:52:17,820
uh,

6065
02:52:17,820 --> 02:52:18,653
growing up,

6066
02:52:19,200 --> 02:52:19,561
you know,

6067
02:52:19,561 --> 02:52:23,280
there's going to be circumstances in
which you could be physically threatened

6068
02:52:23,281 --> 02:52:25,680
and that's socially
acceptable for a woman.

6069
02:52:25,681 --> 02:52:26,610
It's really never,

6070
02:52:27,120 --> 02:52:27,660
I mean,

6071
02:52:27,660 --> 02:52:29,780
unless you being threatened
by another woman or,

6072
02:52:29,781 --> 02:52:31,770
or unless it's like an actual crime,

6073
02:52:31,980 --> 02:52:35,400
but if two boys who are 10 years
old decided to Duke it out,

6074
02:52:35,401 --> 02:52:36,234
it's not a crime.

6075
02:52:36,430 --> 02:52:36,791
You know?

6076
02:52:36,791 --> 02:52:41,320
I think that's a lot of it is there's
a real problem with people and,

6077
02:52:41,410 --> 02:52:44,260
and violent interactions that could,

6078
02:52:44,261 --> 02:52:48,220
a lot of the problems could be resolved
with the introduction of martial arts

6079
02:52:48,250 --> 02:52:49,190
early in people's lives,

6080
02:52:49,191 --> 02:52:49,660
right?

6081
02:52:49,660 --> 02:52:51,940
Like the amount of actual
violence that you see,

6082
02:52:52,110 --> 02:52:52,943
like

6083
02:52:55,200 --> 02:52:58,680
other than sparring and an actual
martial arts environment is almost

6084
02:52:59,120 --> 02:52:59,953
nonexistent.

6085
02:53:00,120 --> 02:53:00,691
It's very,

6086
02:53:00,691 --> 02:53:02,070
very rare and rare.

6087
02:53:02,071 --> 02:53:02,431
Jim,

6088
02:53:02,431 --> 02:53:05,160
we see people arguing or
fighting most of the time.

6089
02:53:05,190 --> 02:53:05,581
It's just,

6090
02:53:05,581 --> 02:53:05,870
you're,

6091
02:53:05,870 --> 02:53:06,150
you're,

6092
02:53:06,150 --> 02:53:07,110
you're getting it all out.

6093
02:53:07,111 --> 02:53:08,280
You getting it on your system.

6094
02:53:08,380 --> 02:53:09,160
I agree with that.

6095
02:53:09,160 --> 02:53:13,900
But I think what maybe what I should have
said was this idea that a man needs to

6096
02:53:13,901 --> 02:53:14,740
stick up for himself.

6097
02:53:14,770 --> 02:53:15,400
Yeah.

6098
02:53:15,400 --> 02:53:15,941
Like all,

6099
02:53:15,941 --> 02:53:16,540
all this,

6100
02:53:16,540 --> 02:53:16,731
the,

6101
02:53:16,731 --> 02:53:18,760
the dish Chicago stuff I
was talking about earlier,

6102
02:53:18,970 --> 02:53:21,910
they had like 50 murders last
month or something crazy.

6103
02:53:21,940 --> 02:53:24,310
And I'm guarantee they're
all men shooting then.

6104
02:53:24,340 --> 02:53:24,431
Yeah,

6105
02:53:24,431 --> 02:53:26,440
but that's a poverty crime,

6106
02:53:26,441 --> 02:53:27,100
gangs,

6107
02:53:27,100 --> 02:53:27,491
drug.

6108
02:53:27,491 --> 02:53:29,300
What has the both sexes exist there?

6109
02:53:29,380 --> 02:53:29,741
Yeah,

6110
02:53:29,741 --> 02:53:30,420
that's true.

6111
02:53:30,420 --> 02:53:33,520
Well there's actually a lot of girls
that are involved in gang crime as well.

6112
02:53:33,530 --> 02:53:34,020
Chicago,

6113
02:53:34,020 --> 02:53:34,540
I'm sure.

6114
02:53:34,540 --> 02:53:37,840
But it's a big article recently about
this one girl died and she was like 19

6115
02:53:37,841 --> 02:53:41,920
years old and she had all these photos
of her online with guns holding up guns

6116
02:53:41,921 --> 02:53:42,910
and shit making gangs.

6117
02:53:42,911 --> 02:53:43,990
I'm sure that's there too.

6118
02:53:43,991 --> 02:53:45,620
But I think the tough guy thing,

6119
02:53:45,970 --> 02:53:47,080
it's definitely a thing.

6120
02:53:47,200 --> 02:53:47,830
It is.

6121
02:53:47,830 --> 02:53:48,820
It's a jungle out there.

6122
02:53:48,850 --> 02:53:49,361
We're out of time.

6123
02:53:49,361 --> 02:53:50,140
Dude.

6124
02:53:50,140 --> 02:53:51,490
Will fucking kill the yeah.

6125
02:53:51,610 --> 02:53:51,911
Hey,

6126
02:53:51,911 --> 02:53:52,540
thanks again.

6127
02:53:52,540 --> 02:53:55,690
Lots of thank you both things we did
today where for really fantastic.

6128
02:53:55,691 --> 02:53:58,660
I can't wait on the smash
it and it was fun to um,

6129
02:53:58,930 --> 02:54:00,310
to do podcasts with you again.

6130
02:54:00,340 --> 02:54:01,270

02:54:01,530 --> 02:54:02,140
Time.

6132
02:54:02,140 --> 02:54:03,580
Never run out of shit to talk about.

6133
02:54:03,581 --> 02:54:04,060
Never.

6134

don't do that.
