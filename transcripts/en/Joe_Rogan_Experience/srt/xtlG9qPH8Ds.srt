1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,850
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,010
I've noticed that ever since
I started making money.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,860
Guys sexually want to dominate me,

4
00:00:07,861 --> 00:00:08,694
choke me,

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,140
spit on me.

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:10,681
Oh,

7
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:11,640
I've gotten spit on.

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,950
That did happen in my twenties
when I was broke though.

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,190
When I was 20 and my brain broke,

10
00:00:19,191 --> 00:00:23,000
I just wanted to cuddle me and contact
and grab your face and we're done.

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,970
Now that I have money,

12
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:24,721
I'm getting choked.

13
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:25,590
I mean spanked.

14
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,880
I gotta I gotta I gotta
tell me what this is.

15
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,870
I had a guy put his four fingers in my
mouth and just leave them there for like

16
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:34,704
two minutes.

17
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,493
What's that?

18
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,333
Wash your hands.

19
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,560
Have a seven year old.

20
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:45,840
She's sick because she touches
things and then touches her mouth.

21
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,460
Yeah.

22
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:47,731
Well,

23
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:48,564
I mean,

24
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,070
just learn so much about you.

25
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,930
You could never be
single by the way today.

26
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,320
You better make this marriage work forever
because you're not gonna be able to

27
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:55,731
handle it.

28
00:00:55,731 --> 00:00:56,640
Cause the hands in the mouth.

29
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:57,900
It's very unsanitary out there,

30
00:00:57,901 --> 00:00:58,560
Joe.

31
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:58,831
Oh,

32
00:00:58,831 --> 00:00:59,191
hands on.

33
00:00:59,191 --> 00:00:59,311
Well,

34
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:00,510
I'm not worried about myself.

35
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,620
So he stuck his hand
in my mouth and it was,

36
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:06,480
I've spent every night,

37
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,500
the comedy store for 10 years.

38
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:08,970
My immune system is on point.

39
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,270
I know I've got a thousand hands at night.

40
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:17,490
And I think that sharing a microphone
with 3,300 road comics every night does a

41
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:19,170
number on your immune system.

42
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:20,280
I never get sick.

43
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,211
Never gets it.

44
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:21,810
Yeah.

45
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:22,770
She can hold those hands.

46
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:27,000
Does it or just believe that sharing
a microphone with Jay London,

47
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,430
you're good for a while.

48
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:31,543
Um,

49
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:32,190
pig pen,

50
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,450
everyone's googling j London and no
results found on last comic standing.

51
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,620
So he stuck his hand in
my mouth and I was like,

52
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:42,270
this did not happen in my twenties and I,

53
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:43,104
and I'm thinking,

54
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:43,943
am I,

55
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,870
are we gagging me?

56
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,580
I've lost the plot at this point.

57
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,340
Did you ask them?

58
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:48,820
Right,

59
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,110
well,

60
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,120
I'm sitting there and I'm like,

61
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,850
just waiting for something that happened.

62
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,101
I can't wait.

63
00:01:54,101 --> 00:01:55,130
I'm not going to talk about.

64
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,933
Um,

65
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,580
and so I'm sitting there and I'm like,

66
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,930
and then for a minute I was like,

67
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:02,990
maybe he lost his balance and he just had,

68
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,423
and he just

69
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,020
like had to commit to it because
it'd be too weird to be like,

70
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:10,321
sorry.

71
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:10,921
And then I was like,

72
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:15,060
maybe he was worried I was going
to speak or because I am one,

73
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,070
maybe he just wanted to
stop me from talking.

74
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:18,240
I don't know what it was,

75
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,910
but this did not happen in
my twenties and I was broke.

76
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:21,780
Well,

77
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,070
got spit on in the face.

78
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:24,680
Spit in the face.

79
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,370
That's dark.

80
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,030
Yes.

81
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,863
Was it a broke?

82
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,000
No,

83
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,090
actually yes.

84
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,063
Hm.

85
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,380
Maybe more wealthy than you.

86
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:35,760
Maybe.

87
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,593
Here's the thing.

88
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,493
Here's the thing.

89
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,030
Here's the thing about my,

90
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:39,860
my,

91
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,140
uh,

92
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,940
this nebulous wealth that I have.

93
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,380
Everyone thinks I have way more than I
have and it's been in the press that I

94
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:47,400
have all this money.

95
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:51,660
So I think guys that do have more money
than me think I have more money than

96
00:02:51,661 --> 00:02:51,871
them,

97
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:52,704
which I started.

98
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:53,410
Yes,

99
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,000
I see.

100
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,540
So maybe it was [inaudible] he
thought I had more than I have.

101
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:58,340
Yeah.

102
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:58,930
He wanted to go.

103
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,860
Just so you know,

104
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:00,760
bitch with the Tesla,

105
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,660
you think you're so
cute with your TV shows.

106
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,380
I'm about to fucking just
treat you like a Thai hooker.

107
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,150
There are people that like that though.

108
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:11,160
That's where it gets weird.

109
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,060
If you date someone who likes weird shit.

110
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,660
Yes.

111
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,520
And then you go to someone else.

112
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,020
I've had that recently where I dated,

113
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,280
I was in a relationship
that was relatively sexually
perverse and then dated

114
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:27,970
someone who was very not and I
was like way overshot the mark.

115
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,190
I mean am I this?

116
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,130
I'm just fuck it.

117
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,020
Um,

118
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,980
I am going to be single
forever after this bike goes.

119
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,053
Um,

120
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,060
I did have a guy one time
cause here's what you do now.

121
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:40,894
I need more coffee.

122
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,793
Jesus Christ.

123
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,330
When you see this is too graphic,

124
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,760
I feel like I'm covering a lot of this
stuff to that Neil degrasse Tyson and

125
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,740
covered on this podcast.

126
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,401
Are we being,

127
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:53,140
are we just talking
about the moon landing?

128
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,693
Um,

129
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,250
you have to gag on Dick's now.

130
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,241
No,

131
00:03:58,241 --> 00:03:58,720
you don't.

132
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:58,990
Yeah.

133
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,730
Well if you don't,

134
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,730
you will be,

135
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,440
uh,

136
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,130
exercise.

137
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:03,611
Yes,

138
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:04,391
you will be.

139
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:05,830
Your head will be pushed down.

140
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:06,940
Um,

141
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,570
yeah,

142
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,700
guys pushed your head
down and you're like,

143
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,580
oh shit.

144
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:10,910
Okay,

145
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,950
this is happening.

146
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,031
I'm like,

147
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:13,870
I have a fucking,

148
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,730
I haven't Tesla two blocks away.

149
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:17,260
Why are you jamming my head on it?

150
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,870
And then so I just thought
that's how you did it.

151
00:04:19,871 --> 00:04:21,190
And then I dated this guy,

152
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:21,820
uh,

153
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,070
and I did that and he goes,

154
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:24,401
oh,

155
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:24,611
no,

156
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:24,761
no,

157
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:25,594
no.

158
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,593
So embarrassing.

159
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,613
He goes,

160
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,580
he goes,

161
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,110
um,

162
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,210
I'm actually not turned on
by girls hurting themselves.

163
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:35,620
And I was like,

164
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,341
Oh God,

165
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:40,120
I was so embarrassed because I remember
like when 30 rock was going on,

166
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,630
I'd go out on a date with a girl and
then like 30 minutes into the date she

167
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,230
starts talking about her boyfriend.

168
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:47,361
I,

169
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:48,194
I'm like,

170
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:48,700
I'm like,

171
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,540

172
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:50,860
She's like,

173
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,041
Oh,

174
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,950
I thought we were just going
out for dinner on like friends.

175
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:54,490
And I'm like,

176
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:54,820
I'm like,

177
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,720
I asked you out,

178
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,160
it's Saturday night.

179
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,280
And I'm like,

180
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:58,390
oh,

181
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,741
I go to her,

182
00:04:58,741 --> 00:04:58,930
like,

183
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,763

184
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,723
are you,

185
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,930
are you cheating on your boyfriend?

186
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:02,141
And you know,

187
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:03,430
I didn't know many more like he is,

188
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:04,130
he got a town,

189
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,440
are you guys have an open relationship?

190
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:05,741
She's like,

191
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:06,370
no,

192
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,180
he's here.

193
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:07,511
I'm like,

194
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:08,344
well where is he

195
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:10,961
got the apartment?

196
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:11,560
I'm like,

197
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,640
well fucking go and hand.

198
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:13,780
What the fuck you doing over here with me?

199
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,790
You know how many times this happened?

200
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,450
That happened a few times where girls
would like want to like go out with me

201
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:23,930
just to take pictures so they can
tell their Facebook friends and oh,

202
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,450
so they became friends with you
because you were on television.

203
00:05:27,451 --> 00:05:27,671
Right,

204
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:28,271
exactly.

205
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:29,870
So that romance I think,

206
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,700
I think when that stuff
was happening that's also,

207
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,120
I don't know.

208
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,960
I'm just guessing here.

209
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:36,490
I don't have the exact answers.

210
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,540
I'm just thinking out loud,

211
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,350
but I think that's maybe sort of around
the same time when I started worrying

212
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:42,760
about like bloggers and shit,

213
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:43,520
like shitting on it.

214
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:43,751
You know,

215
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:48,751
my friend Eddie has this theory about
bill Cosby about a bill Cosby when he

216
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:55,531
started doing that to women and he thinks
that that might have been the similar

217
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:58,430
type of situation where these
women wanted to be around him,

218
00:05:58,431 --> 00:06:02,570
but they were turning him down and he
started drugging them that he started

219
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,110
raping of,

220
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,770
yeah,

221
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,370
yeah,

222
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:04,960
yeah.

223
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,050
Did that I just left.

224
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:06,943
Yeah.

225
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,630
You're much better man than him.

226
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,190
But you know what I mean?

227
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:14,690
Like that can happen where someone is
attracted to you simply because you're a

228
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:16,850
famous person who think,

229
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:17,111
well,

230
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:17,391
hey,

231
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:19,340
this is a girl that I'm
romantically interested in it.

232
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:20,174
I'd like to go anywhere.

233
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,810
Then you're at dinner,

234
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:23,930
what the fuck,

235
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:24,231
man.

236
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:24,740
So you're,

237
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,790
you're talking to this girl,

238
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,001
you go,

239
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:26,480
Hey,

240
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,470
do you want to go out to dinner?

241
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:27,951
And she's like,

242
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:28,191
yeah,

243
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:28,850
that sounds good.

244
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,040
Yeah,

245
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,630
yeah,

246
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,020
yeah.

247
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,700
And then all of a sudden
you were on a date.

248
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,650
It's just telling you about
her boyfriend and Saturday,

249
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:34,484
it's 10 o'clock.

250
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,090
Yeah.

251
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:35,751
And you're thinking,

252
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:36,231
yeah,

253
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:37,160
look at you.

254
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,233
I'm

255
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,080
just going to get some all right.

256
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,011
And she's like,

257
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:43,101
yeah,

258
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:46,550
my boyfriend's waiting for me that
she just casually mentioned him about

259
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:46,911
something.

260
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:47,151
Oh yeah,

261
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:48,230
my boyfriend said this or something.

262
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:48,560
I'm like,

263
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,020
Huh?

264
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,570
What?

265
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,250
Yeah.

266
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,470
And this happened more than once.

267
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,640
Yeah.

268
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,460
Gonna go into movies
and is gonna you know,

269
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,410
take off and become this.

270
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,750
So she's fine either way but issue
because do people want to see those movies

271
00:07:02,811 --> 00:07:06,750
the same way they want to see those
movies when she was smashing Alexis Davis

272
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,830
and armbarring Misha Tate
knocking out Batchko Hey,

273
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:12,590
uh Dee Dee is there that same draw?

274
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:13,850
Well I'll say this,

275
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,150
I don't think people are going to
Rhonda movies cause she's a phenomenal

276
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,013
actress.

277
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,010
Does that make sense?

278
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:19,191
Like,

279
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:20,360
I'm not going to see Ron's moocs.

280
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,140
You got to see her.

281
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,570
You got to see her act
in this sheet is amazing.

282
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,410
She is because she's,

283
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,300
because she's supposedly the baddest woman
on the planet now Holly Holm shut her

284
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:32,660
down.

285
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:32,840
Yeah.

286
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,570
So now Holly is thought to be
the baddest woman on the planet,

287
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:35,931
correct?

288
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:36,320
Right.

289
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:36,770
Correct.

290
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:36,950
If,

291
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,360
unless she fights cyborg.

292
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:39,890
If they figured out a catch weight fight,

293
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,551
you know,

294
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:40,661
in,

295
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:41,494
in MMA,

296
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,150
that's really the big scary
fight for her for sure.

297
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:44,421
You know?

298
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:45,410
And she said she would fight her.

299
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,060
Yeah,

300
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,310
she's,

301
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,800
she's fought at one 52 in boxing.

302
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:49,431
You know,

303
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:50,264
Holly Holm,

304
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:50,841
she's,

305
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:51,674
she's gangster.

306
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,480
But I mean,

307
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:57,230
I think other than w what
would you do if you were,

308
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,080
if you were the promoter,

309
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,940
let me ask you this,

310
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,320
what would you do if I'm Dana White?

311
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,183
Yes.

312
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,120
Scrooge McDuck.

313
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,630
If I'm above scrooge McDuck Dana White.

314
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:06,530
Well,

315
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,270
I fire Reebok right now,

316
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:08,751
by the way.

317
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:10,640
I say scrooge McDuck ice crate.

318
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:12,680
Say Scrooge McDuck like three
or four times a week now,

319
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,880
strictly because of you.

320
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,180
He sent me this text the other day with
a picture of scrooge McDuck sitting on a

321
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:22,550
pile of gold and I was just laughing,

322
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,600
laughing.

323
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,980
I love that character.

324
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,170
The fight like you did with Chad
and we got the biggest fight.

325
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,460
You no biggest fighter of all time.

326
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,271
Wild Shit.

327
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:29,991
But the thing is,

328
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:31,160
is if you look at the,

329
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:31,460
if,

330
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,420
if I'm a businessman,

331
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:32,690
I'm not,

332
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,620
not as much water as fun,

333
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:34,520
but a businessman,

334
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:39,240
Conor winning is the golden
ticket button play too,

335
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,960
because Josie,

336
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,560
you know,

337
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,810
he's not even be around that much longer,

338
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:42,171
right?

339
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:45,170
But there's never been a guy like
Conor before the UFC has been fine.

340
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,540
Like you don't need to know.

341
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,810
It's not necessarily the best thing.

342
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,940
[inaudible] Dana's still scrooge.

343
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:51,380
Mcduck I'm not saying son,

344
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,340
I'm not,

345
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,600
I'm not saying he goes broke,

346
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:55,950
but I don't even think it's just
talking about the new heights.

347
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,910
I don't think so.

348
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:57,823
Look at this

349
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:03,660
after the backstroke
through a sea of gold.

350
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,160
Like you love that guy.

351
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,980
I just never thought about it till you
started bringing up scrooge McDuck I

352
00:09:11,981 --> 00:09:13,380
never thought about that cartoon.

353
00:09:13,381 --> 00:09:14,550
It's random as fuck.

354
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:14,881
Whatever.

355
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:15,840
You talk about money,

356
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:18,290
like I ain't scrooge
McDuck don't likes treats.

357
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,841
That's right.

358
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:21,270
Scrooge McDuck yet a lot
of money ball and son.
