1
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,060
Four three, two, one.

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,610
So we get here and young Jamie is obsessed
with whether or not Leonardo Davinci

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,730
is gay and uh, so he says it
the Cowan and then Callan says,

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,460
he said the Mona Lisa,

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,690
the Mona Lisa has a
mischievous smile on her face.

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,390
And apparently according
to art historians,

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,880
I believe that is a self portrait.

8
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:30,540
And that was Davinci himself in drags.

9
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:35,400
This is a conspiracy and that's why he
is looking back at you with sort of a rye

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,540
smirk. I don't see that rise.
Smart Young. Jamie, please pull up.

11
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,470
This photo graph is a masterpiece. No,
this is, I think this, this is real.

12
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:47,520
I think this is, um, at least
Dan Brown in his book. Uh,

13
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:50,650
the Da Vinci Code actually talks about it,
but I I,

14
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:55,140
this is the standard talking about
the topic movies. Yes. Good. Well,

15
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,150
better bumper. That was a different
thing than the middle man.

16
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,170
I think he's a professor of theology in,

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,970
at Harvard or he or something like
that. Okay. I don't see a sly smile.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,090
I see. Here's a check who lives in a
place where the food sucks and her,

19
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:15,080
her teeth are probably all fucked
up is often that dick smile row.

20
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,010
Here's an interesting thing.

21
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:20,370
Do you know that like people did
at bad teeth back then of course,

22
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:24,840
but the majority of the teeth problems
that we have in this country have to do

23
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:29,430
with sugar. I thought it was the, the
water, the fluoride in the water. No,

24
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,870
Florida in the water. That fluoride
in the water thing is so sketchy.

25
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,870
Have you ever looked into whether or
not fluoride should be in the water?

26
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,440
Well they,
I know the fifties,

27
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,480
Colorado had a high concentration of
fluoride in its water and apparently the

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,050
Sweden turns to the find out.
I know

29
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,990
if I could get my poker, I'm going to
poke at the uh, at the board. But I think,

30
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:03,210
I think it came out of Colorado where
there was high concentrations of fluoride

31
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:06,000
in the water. And then what
happened was they go, well,

32
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,730
there's a cluster of people
who are not getting cavities.

33
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,950
And so apparently fluoride is
effective at keeping cavities and bay.

34
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,970
And I grew up overseas,
my teeth to fucking tear or hole goals.

35
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,940
I had fuck his, you eat sugar?
What? Well, not so much overseas,

36
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:25,050
but I,
I uh,

37
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,610
I definitely didn't brush my teeth a lot
and I didn't have fluoride. Well, let's,

38
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:33,900
let's Google whether or not there's
evidence that fluoride is good for tooth

39
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,470
decay. The good thing,
because all marketing hype
from crest, I don't know man,

40
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:38,910
I've read too many hippie articles.

41
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:43,890
The problem at the Hippie Arby's refuse
you because it'll say like natural news

42
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,240
letter through like Colin Shit.
You don't know man,

43
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:51,270
because there's people that are get like
Oh homeopathic on you and you're like,

44
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,310
okay, is this guy right? Like I'm reading,

45
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:57,120
I'm going to go through 5,000 words here
am I, is he right or is this horse shit?

46
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,890
Am I going to, okay, now I gotta
look up the actual studies.

47
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,251
Okay.

48
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:03,520
Now I gotta read this three times cause
I'm stupid and I can't figure out how to

49
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:08,350
you. Let's say for it, no evidence
that fluoridated water causes cavities,

50
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,250
reduces cavities, rather
Macola. Now that's a one.

51
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,540
Now I've posted articles from mercola.com
and people go, oh, that guy's amazing.

52
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,840
And then other people go though that
guy's a fraud. It's tough to figure out.

53
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:21,850
I've read some stop on Doctor Mercola.

54
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,740
You read just like the
same kind of stopped and he
seems to be pretty like he's

55
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:31,660
a doctor, but that doesn't mean he's
an expert on to the gay or on, uh, on,

56
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:35,620
on looking at the hard evidence behind
it to the American Dental Association,

57
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:36,810
Florida and Water I field,

58
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,390
they must have some seven
years of scientific research.
You guys are lucky at.

59
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:44,950
He's not here. Oh yeah, saint
right now. Shit. He's on a,

60
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:49,570
an evolution kick now more than 70 years
of scientific research has consistently

61
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:54,040
shown that an optimal level of fluoride
in community water is safe and effective

62
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,760
in preventing tooth decay.
Safe is a scary word. Why?

63
00:03:57,761 --> 00:04:00,760
Why would you be worried about that
by at least 25% of all children,

64
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:02,290
adults simply by drinking water.

65
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:06,220
Americans can benefit from flora cavity
protection without not their homework or

66
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:07,750
school centers for Disease Control,

67
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:10,540
control and prevention named
community water fluoridation.

68
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:14,080
One of tain 10 great public health
achievements of the 20th century. Okay,

69
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,400
now go to the one that says there's
no evidence because I got out.

70
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,060
Who the fuck is right here?

71
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:23,890
But I would suggest that it's
been around a long timelines,

72
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,780
says it ain't hit her. It has
been, but that was what I mean.

73
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,090
Remember what the food pyramid used to
look like. It was all like spaghetti

74
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,310
preview
by the cup.

75
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,880
Collaboration found water fluoridation
may not prevent cavities in a review of

76
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:48,350
every fluoridation study they could find.
[inaudible] I dunno the Cochran,

77
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,100
let me finish talking. I know you
guys like to talk over each other,

78
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:53,250
but let's trying to totally do bro.
Um,

79
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,010
view of every fluoridation
study they could find.

80
00:04:57,011 --> 00:05:01,060
Only three studies since 1975 look at the
effectiveness of water fluoridation at

81
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:05,830
reducing tooth decay among the general
population and had high enough quality to

82
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:06,611
be included.

83
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:10,240
The studies found fluoridation does
not reduce cavities to is statistically

84
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:14,590
significant degree in permanent teeth in
the two studies since 1975 that examine

85
00:05:14,591 --> 00:05:18,940
the effectiveness of fluoridation and
reduce reducing cavities in baby teeth.

86
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:22,420
No significant reduction
was noted there either.

87
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,650
You know what I'm thinking right now?

88
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,560
You know it's gone on in my head was
crying my head right now as I go.

89
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,310
I'm thinking this is why Google is
not a place to go for information.

90
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:33,090
A little bit true job have to be
discerning. You have to. You have to.

91
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,230
This is what peer reviewed
papers are so important.

92
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:38,410
This is why it was like
really valuable journalists,

93
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,410
scientific journalists especially
are important. That's right.

94
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,740
That's fucking morons like us.
We don't know who's right.

95
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,820
We just said something
and people go, well, no,

96
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,820
what so I feel like we have
to get to the bottom of this,

97
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:53,800
although I think that's, give them all
the mythbusters, some shit. My dentist,

98
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:58,070
we map the three of us,
you guys know got to the bottom

99
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,890
to the bottom. You can kind of look
at general trends. Like I said to my,

100
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:07,640
I had all this metal in my teeth, right?
And my dentist, I was like, look man,

101
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:11,510
I got to get it out cause you know,
leaks, mercury and, and he said,

102
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,500
I know I was on the,

103
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:16,760
I was on that study panel and
if you look at the massive,

104
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,750
the massive number of people
that have metal in their mouth,

105
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,130
you'd have,

106
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,280
you would be able to draw some pretty
broad based conclusions because you have

107
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:29,330
such a huge human yeah.
Pool. And they just haven't,

108
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:31,790
they looked at the don't do a
lot of comprehensive studies.

109
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,910
Same dentist who said your
teeth are straight. Uh, no,

110
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,300
this is a different one and I'm wearing
my Invisalign so I'd appreciate it if

111
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:40,490
you wouldn't go through my teeth. How
does, they're going to be an amazing,

112
00:06:40,491 --> 00:06:42,590
we're at night. I'm wearing them
right now. And you can't tell.

113
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,140
I remember when Tom Cruise is like
15 and he got braces. I was like, Yo,

114
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,370
what are you doing? They came in because
he knows. He's like, you don't hit my bed.

115
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,830
Changes his voice. Do you remember?
Wait a minute, did he do that?

116
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:55,580
He went with veneers.
They're brilliant.

117
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,540
Steve are so veneers are amazing.
That's what I'm saying, Bro. Amazing.

118
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,160
I had a friend,
she did it.

119
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,980
One of the girls that I did news
radio with almost hit her name. Well,

120
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:06,160
I'll get us to three for
one deal up in a forefront.

121
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,350
One Jamie wants to keep lungs. If you
look at the good ones, you're like,

122
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:14,330
God damn you teeth are fucking fantastic.
No there that Bam Tom Cruise. What? Look,

123
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,240
I don't know if that is a veneers or
braces come because he did wear braces.

124
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,930
Look,
it has real teeth to look at the left.

125
00:07:23,931 --> 00:07:27,320
I think there is real teeth and I
think the one on the left is just,

126
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:31,190
it could be shopped. I don't remember them
being that bad. I think it's Photoshop.

127
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,200
Yeah,
see that's why he's wearing braces.

128
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,540
Real ta do look for it.
I think those are his real teeth.

129
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,040
Go to him before braces to go to him.

130
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,240
Go to him smiling in the color of money
cause he was a really young in that

131
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:51,710
movie, Taco Tom Cruise,
color of money smiling.

132
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:54,100
She's such a nice Tom Cruise is a monster.

133
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:58,210
I just watched the color of money on a
flight. It was fucking crazy right there.

134
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:01,310
The far left, far left. Holy Shit.
Yeah, those are his teeth bro.

135
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,930
He just gathers those frontline.

136
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,590
Those front ones have been knocked out
and those, those are fake. There's no, no,

137
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:09,500
no. This is a long time ago man.
This is, this is the color of money.

138
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:14,210
This is like 1986 and I'm saying the
rest of the teeth or the color yellow and

139
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:16,170
the middle ones are white,
but that's hard to tell.

140
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,140
You seem dark shadows all over the place.

141
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:20,840
You can't really gauge yellow right there.
Look at that.

142
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,880
It's so hard to huge his teeth look
like that. I've seen all those books,

143
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,401
gentlemen.

144
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:29,870
You can't even see his right eye judging
whether or not that's his teeth color.

145
00:08:29,871 --> 00:08:32,860
You can literally can't see his right
eye because he's in so much shafts.

146
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,280
Teeth don't look super suspect. Do you
know they look like teeth right there.

147
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,210
You crazy. That's his teeth. His
teeth normal. His teeth were,

148
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,850
you're judging by today's standards.
That's the problem.

149
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,970
They make those teeth perfect like that
dude. If you act bad teeth back then,

150
00:08:47,971 --> 00:08:51,560
if you had fake teeth, they look fake
as fuck. That's true. He, his teeth,

151
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,320
his teeth were off center like
you know where the middle teeth,

152
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:56,070
they were all kind of

153
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,670
pushed over to the right. Now they're
way better. That's why smiling,

154
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,350
crooked 56 still doing an action.

155
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,250
Movies still does his own stunts jumps
from building to building breaks his

156
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:09,240
ankle and filming. Have you
seen that shit? No. Apparently
it's mission impossible.

157
00:09:09,241 --> 00:09:12,930
Movie is a motherfucker and he's
killing it. They said it's killing it.

158
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:17,670
It's awesome. Yeah, the mission possible
yet me to hear and it's fantastic.

159
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:23,780
He's awesome. He's really star Fuck.
But he's awesome. He's awesome.

160
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:27,720
Nice. His Shit. You know what else,
dude? He's, he was watch this.

161
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,210
He jumps off this and breaks his
ankle and he really did that.

162
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,390
Did the watch when he lands,
watch how Jack does apple get.

163
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,710
Boom.
All fucked up.

164
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,280
You ain't ready for that be you
want to be a worldwide action here?

165
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,860
I can't do that. I'll look at that
one showed hits. Watch HUD heads.

166
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,200
I don't quite make it.

167
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:51,201
Snapper Rooney Jog Dick to the metal.

168
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,530
He still finishing. He's still, yes. Look,

169
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:59,220
he's still jumped over the toughest
still and seen homeboy lamb that concrete

170
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:04,110
into his dick bone and look how he pulled
off. He hobbled off when he got up.

171
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,210
That's why you have to have a stunt
man cause you're going to get,

172
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,380
you guys are hardcore man,
but he likes everything.

173
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:14,940
He does all the car driving stunts
does all that shit. I didn't know that.

174
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,770
I didn't know. Look up your tongue. I
have to look up shit as a free country.

175
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,410
He might have a, a dark wish for the
end of one of those words. Oh my God.

176
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:27,110
He might have a dark,
which I have.

177
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:31,740
I have friend people discredit them
because the Scientology stuff, absolutely.

178
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:36,130
100% do and Burlison the Scientology
thing is just how he gets by. Yup.

179
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,090
There's a lot of people that have
their own ideologies, but they,

180
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:42,360
believe it or not,
it might be radical left ideology.

181
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:46,410
There's a lot of conservative former
like actors that are like super

182
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:49,690
conservative. They're on Twitter, like
they're in it. They're in a cult, correct?

183
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,310
Correct. They're all rat. Everyone's
wrapped up in this own little thing.

184
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,820
His thing is just crazy. It's fucked by
a guy who was a science fiction author,

185
00:10:56,821 --> 00:11:00,160
a war, a fucking captains coat on with
a bunch of turtles. He knew himself,

186
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,480
but they have some legit buildings.
You driven by the Hollywood actors.

187
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,650
They have legit actress, man.
Dude, Tom Cruise is fucking legit.

188
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,990
John Travolta has done
some silly nonsense,

189
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,280
but he's also Altimas also
done pulp fucking fashion.

190
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:19,490
He did carry when he was like really
back to the Saturday night live face off

191
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:23,480
dude. He's a very fit and active
as a terrible movie. Face off. Oh

192
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,770
one when they cut the face off
and put it on the other person,

193
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:34,310
naked structure magically changes.
And Nick Cage looks like John Travolta,

194
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:40,830
anti technology terrorist.
There's no way Bro. Okay.

195
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:45,120
What did it happen if Brian put it on you?
I would think

196
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,150
there's a Munster here. First
of all, your head's way bigger.

197
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,280
So your skin a bit like some
60 year old lady from Bel Air.

198
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,370
So 60 year old ladies where their mouth
looks like it's so big a key your head.

199
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,511
Cause they've been pulling,

200
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:04,480
they're pulling their skin back
to their mouth or like a joker.

201
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,850
They lose fat in their face.
As you get older, you, Meryl,

202
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,480
you used to make fun of me for taking an
acting class and I stayed in that last

203
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:15,070
for eight years longer than I needed
to because I love a train wreck.

204
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:20,530
And these two guys did a c Jeffrey tambor
was teaching and these two guys did a

205
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:25,370
scene from faceoff and
the curtain comes up and,

206
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:30,540
and one guy's hanging from a chain and
the other guy's torturing him and it's

207
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:35,290
like, and then he goes, yeah. And it's
all and he's hitting him and it's crazy.

208
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,760
And at the end of the scenes,
like scene, everybody was like,

209
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,850
and then Jeffrey tambor just takes
a sip of his coffee and he goes,

210
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:48,610
what was that scene? And the
guy goes, face off, face off.

211
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,340
What is that? It's a movie. It's an
action movie. John Travolta in an occasion

212
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,940
that's seen as band forever.

213
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:07,020
That was it. Moving man.
Yeah, whatever. God,

214
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,440
I heard this gaudy movie's terrible,
but it's like the worst movie of all time.

215
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,650
I've heard it already. Yeah. That was
like a zoo. Tomatoes. Well, I don't know.

216
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:25,360
I saw the, I saw the trailer and I got
into it. Okay, let's, let's just Google.

217
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,980
How bad is the Gotti movie?
It's, I mean, there was, it say

218
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:36,430
that's amazing. Two out
of 10 is insane. Okay,

219
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,600
that's great. That has to be
correct. He's great. He looks good.

220
00:13:39,601 --> 00:13:43,110
It looks like a Bob. He looks good. He
looks like a good God. He John's fault.

221
00:13:43,111 --> 00:13:43,440
Faultless.

222
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,370
Shulkin macked is Fox those j
Simpson on FX played a ship.

223
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:50,350
Oh, that's right. Yeah,
that's fine. These are credit.

224
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:54,370
He's a great actress and everything,
man. He just does a lot of bad movies.

225
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,840
You know shorty,
he just does not done a lot of bad movies.

226
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,690
I know Tom Cruise is
done from end of days.

227
00:14:01,691 --> 00:14:04,940
Even like all those movies did he
know I love him. Guy was amazing.

228
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,870
It's fucking fantastic. Best movie.
You know what else is good with that?

229
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,730
What does the, is that the one the
tomorrow again he dies. It keeps dying.

230
00:14:12,731 --> 00:14:15,940
That's it. Does that end of days?
No, I'm thinking of a different one.

231
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:19,330
He did like two science fiction movies.
I'm thinking of direct to tomorrow.

232
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:24,490
Yes. That was what it was called. It
was called edge it tomorrow originally.

233
00:14:24,491 --> 00:14:26,290
And then like we've talked
about this before, the change.

234
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,790
That's right because the marketing,

235
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,180
cause it came out and kissed their
original marketing was edge of tomorrow,

236
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:33,190
whatever the fuck it came out.
And then people are like,

237
00:14:33,191 --> 00:14:35,650
God that no one showed up to it.
But the people that went were like,

238
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,040
that's like the greatest movie ever.
So then it started to gain traction.

239
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,110
They're like, hold up, we
need to relabel this thing.

240
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,710
Then they relabeled it and that movie's
fucking, that might be his best movie.

241
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,560
It's a great fucking mood,
a great fucking science fiction movie.

242
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:53,510
It is one of the most underrated
science fiction movies ever.

243
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:56,750
And if you're a [inaudible] fan and
you avoided it just because, oh,

244
00:14:56,751 --> 00:15:00,920
it's a Tom cruise movie. Yeah. You fucked
up because it is amazing. It's amazing.

245
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:04,130
I did a reading with him one time
and, and uh, he in the reading,

246
00:15:04,131 --> 00:15:07,940
it was just literally me, him,
Eric Stoltz, Amy Smart Luby. Uh,

247
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:11,750
it was moving that never got made
called men and I, I was reading,

248
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:14,930
I was reading all the parts opposite
him and [inaudible] they were talking to

249
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:18,080
Owen Wilson. So I was right next
to him and I spent, I don't know,

250
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,810
maybe three hours with him and
it was a small, nobody was out.

251
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,510
Nobody else was in the room,
like just Todd Phillips and a couple bags.

252
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:28,070
He in the reading like in the
reading as you're just doing it,

253
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:33,170
acting full out and amazing and,
and just loves it.

254
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:35,810
And almost like his eyes were watery
at one point where everything's like,

255
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:38,240
all the chips are down in the scene.
And I was just like,

256
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:39,700
this fucking dude is up make.

257
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,640
I kept staring at him and I
believed everything he was
doing and just sitting at

258
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:46,490
a table and we get there, he's a
little late, just a little late,

259
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:50,670
profusely apologizes. He's got to,
haven't eaten. Just give me a second, I'm,

260
00:15:50,671 --> 00:15:52,880
I've done about it. And he's
just talking. He's so nice.

261
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:58,060
And he had five pieces of Sashimi with
tiny little pepper on each one and some

262
00:15:58,311 --> 00:16:02,050
Penta water. And he was like, thank you
so much. That was great. Pupil boom.

263
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,870
And then we went out red thing and then
he wanted to hear what all of us thought

264
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:10,100
of the script. What are suggestions
were? And when he listens to you,

265
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,590
his eyes sparkle, his mouth moves
in an oh like you can be like,

266
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:20,090
I think I was a little confused in the
beginning and he's like, Whoa, hold on.

267
00:16:20,091 --> 00:16:23,240
What do you, what he, you know, he's
zeroed in on you. And I was like,

268
00:16:23,241 --> 00:16:27,430
this guy loves me, man. We're going to be
best friends and then I never happened.

269
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:31,490
Yeah, we dated for it. We can put you
in the mission impossible or some shit.

270
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,910
I talk, I spent time with him.
Dude. You're not Scientology.

271
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:38,780
Well he could get you to join. I
think he could get you to join. Yeah.

272
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,140
I wouldn't show up and I'd be like,
yeah,

273
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,180
of course he would get mad
that you weren't showing up.

274
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,420
But if you did show up and you charmed
people there and just rub backs,

275
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:49,220
I know a lot of self taught
it that you loved them.

276
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:54,280
I was in the class for 10 years.
That is cited in the book by uh, in,

277
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:58,310
in um, going clear at that whole class
that, that I was in that class. She was,

278
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,440
I remember you had me come to one
of those little boots. Sure did.

279
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:05,620
I went to an event, a thing that was
going on, watch the guy saying we, we,

280
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,650
we watched the guys sing while we were
so high and we were in like a neighboring

281
00:17:09,651 --> 00:17:14,060
dimension watching reality through a
dirty mirror in the Scientology building.

282
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,000
I want to get near there. It was
near there. It was that theater.

283
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:21,470
We were barbecued. I mean,
Bubba, Bubba, Bubba, Bubba,
Bubba, Bubba, bubba barbecue,

284
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:26,770
freaking out watching this that they were
singing musicals and it was not good.

285
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:32,510
And Joe was just like, wow,
this was amazing. So much money.

286
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,040
I drove by the one in, it's kind of like
the silver lake area, Hollywood man,

287
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,830
they've got a lot of money. Did you
read going clear this little book? It's,

288
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,490
there's, there's a lot of
what? What's good about crazy,

289
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,550
what's good about crazy
and about being like,

290
00:17:46,551 --> 00:17:51,120
if you have a fucking purpose in life,
man, it doesn't have to be rational.

291
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:55,980
But if you have a purpose, if you have
like a clear directive in terms of,

292
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:57,750
you know,
l Ron Hubbard says this,

293
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,870
and so I'm just gonna listen and I'm going
to push forward and I'm going to stay

294
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:04,020
positive and I'm going to
avoid the negative people
and I'm gonna use all these

295
00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:08,170
tools in order to maximize my performance.
All good shit works. Yeah. All good.

296
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,220
It could be to your thing, some
made up nonsense. And by the way,

297
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:13,650
if you read anything about, by the way,
when Callan's around and start saying,

298
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:17,100
by the way, by the way you read
anything about l Ron Hubbard,

299
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:19,470
they essentially think
that he was self healing,

300
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,990
that he was creating his bat shit crazy.

301
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,540
He was having you do an
inventory of how his brain works.

302
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,620
Like that's what he did.
He took it,

303
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:30,250
he took a detailed inventory
over many years of how, how uh,

304
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:34,050
how the minutia of his brain worked
and he really category he cataloged it.

305
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,050
That's why a lot of some
of it, he borrowed a lot of
like old systems and stuff.

306
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:38,640
But some of it is I love works.

307
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,750
I love you made everyone were
like navy fucking outfits.

308
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,400
Like the commanders were
like in AP fucking up.

309
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:48,600
But if you think about a Christianity c
focused the European and American mind

310
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:50,030
for a long time.
Yeah,

311
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,930
everybody was on the same page and it
was very easy to kind of move things

312
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:58,920
forward as a uniform body and nobody
kind of disputed what the truth was.

313
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:03,290
And so that's a reason that like with
Hubbard, I feel like with Scientology, um,

314
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,260
I'm pretty sure they're signups are
going down because of research and with

315
00:19:07,261 --> 00:19:12,180
everyone in the sea org. That's
it. That's it. Oh my God.

316
00:19:12,181 --> 00:19:16,500
Apparently that little design is cash to
the front. Yeah, it is. Whoop your ass.

317
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:19,530
You get on the line now. Yeah.
He's beat the shit. He made
the shit up. Yeah, right.

318
00:19:19,531 --> 00:19:22,370
Yeah. Like if you're like, oh sorry sir,
your hands down just fucked up today.

319
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,450
Like beat your ass legitimately kick
people's ass. Apparently it was that.

320
00:19:26,451 --> 00:19:29,490
Who was that said that David
Miscavige has dad. Is that his dad?

321
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,090
His Dad and then also on the document
you talked about how abusive and the book

322
00:19:33,091 --> 00:19:36,120
is crazy. He goes into detail about
David Miscavige. Yeah, Tom Cruise.

323
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:40,630
Katie then I'm sorry, what
was his dad's name? Ron. Ron
Miscavige. Sorry, Ron. Hi Ron.

324
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,000
The podcast. Oh, interesting. Made me
sad. Yeah, it doesn't talk to his son.

325
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:46,170
You know that.

326
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,890
That's the thing that made me the most
sad that the dad and the son don't talk

327
00:19:49,891 --> 00:19:51,990
to each other.
We over some nonsense.

328
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,860
The best thing I ever heard was a guy
I knew who was a teacher and he was had

329
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,030
Scientologists and had been for 23 years.
And somebody said,

330
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,830
are you a scientologist? And you kind
of get caught off guard. And he said,

331
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,890
well let's examine that for a sec.
I,

332
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,960
she's taking classes there for 20 years
and I've found enormous benefit from

333
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:14,640
some of them and some of them and I've
paid money for some of my found zero

334
00:20:14,641 --> 00:20:19,390
benefit from. So, uh, and, and I, and
I put into practice some of the cuff,

335
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,520
you know, some of the courses and stuff.
So if that makes me a scientologist,

336
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,530
I guessed I am. It was kind of a good
answer. That's a very good answer. Yeah.

337
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,170
I mean that's, there's, you can get
that out of a lot of things. Sure.

338
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,420
There's a lot of things that are like
that, that have some nonsense in them,

339
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,660
but I think people operate really well
when they have like a scaffolding,

340
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,080
like a structure that they have to follow
it. Yeah. And then they have a purpose.

341
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,620
They think there's a Po,
a positive action,

342
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:47,190
their directive and that there's going
to be some grand plan that they fit.

343
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,580
Yeah, perfectly. Because of their work.
That's the wrong with that either.

344
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,410
Listen man, if that works for you, if you
push it until the contract breaks out,

345
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,010
but it's just if you bill. Yeah,
right. I mean look at Leah Remini.

346
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,090
I mean lear remedies.
She has the worst fucking person over.

347
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,340
This dude's

348
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:12,590
crazy man doesn't get off.
She doesn't give a fuck and cheese.

349
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,470
She likes being that girl.
That's her. She likes that role.

350
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:20,200
It's almost like she was
designed because he like,

351
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:22,930
it didn't make sense that she was in
Scientology to begin with when I met her.

352
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,990
Right. Because when I met, she's like
this take no bullshit. East Coast chick.

353
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,460
It was also beautiful. So I was
like, Huh, she's a scientologist.

354
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,280
I always got along with her always.
She was always very friendly,

355
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:36,580
but there was always this like be
careful don't same thing. Stupid jokes.

356
00:21:36,581 --> 00:21:40,230
Like all right, Jesus. Yeah. I spelled
the same way. I had such a crush.

357
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,880
She had so much power.
So here's the thing,

358
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:45,150
if she's got all this machine
that she's just say by the bell,

359
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:49,660
but she's got all this like she's got
all this like brass and the weight,

360
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,090
how does she get sucked into
that? Well, she was a little kid.

361
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,650
That's how she grew up in it. She got
sold a bill of goods and so she was like,

362
00:21:56,651 --> 00:21:58,810
wait a minute, boy. They
should have kept her.

363
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,710
But how did you Tom Cruise Tom.

364
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,560
How'd they get Tom Though? Like Tom wasn't
that young, was very young. He was very,

365
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,160
how they get them and John Travolta.
Well,

366
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,590
I think people want
something that makes it look,

367
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,760
I bought the book I bought
Diane. Yeah, me too.

368
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:18,070
I bought it through a late
night at 1994 son pre internet.

369
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:22,540
I was at home chilling in my apartment
in north Hollywood and I was like, damn,

370
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:26,530
this sounds like they're making a lot
of sense here and it doesn't make sense

371
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,770
the Laba,
but some of it does.

372
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:35,180
What are you 35 I'm 50 15
years older than you do.

373
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,080
You got to think. You don't really
remember before the Internet.

374
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,280
You were like an infant.

375
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:45,210
I was here as a grown man when the
Internet hit in 1994 but before that you

376
00:22:46,301 --> 00:22:50,370
would get late night infomercials. You'd
be buying fucking squeegees and shit.

377
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:55,390
[inaudible] I was pre cell phone, bro.
Yeah. When I met him on the phone,

378
00:22:55,570 --> 00:23:00,550
now I know you guys were older telling
you this is dianetics was something you'd

379
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:03,220
see on late night television and it was
really compelling because you can't do

380
00:23:03,221 --> 00:23:07,060
any research. Dude. There was no Google.
There was no, there was no youtube.

381
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:11,260
Eddie Bravo would have been
his boss. Eddie knowledge. No,

382
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:14,560
but with all of us,
no one really knew.

383
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:16,790
This is how a lot of things snuck through.
This is,

384
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:21,370
you are curious all the way I
no, no, no, no, no. I never went.

385
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,233
We never thought,

386
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:25,630
we never thought that
Arnold Schwarzenegger or
[inaudible] or any of those

387
00:23:25,631 --> 00:23:29,660
people were doing sterile shut the fuck
didn't I was seven and knew that before.

388
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,090
I knew they were doing stairs.

389
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,850
When I saw Rambo two I just thought that
was from weightlifting. No, I knew it.

390
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:38,170
Steroids when I was in high school.
I didn't think I didn't,

391
00:23:38,171 --> 00:23:41,770
I didn't know that Hollywood, I didn't
know when you see demolition, man, I,

392
00:23:41,771 --> 00:23:44,500
I just thought I was like, Dude,
how'd they get so fucking cut?

393
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:46,130
I've got to start working out.
I didn't know

394
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,700
that. Right, right. Maybe cause I
wasn't in the workout world, but I,

395
00:23:48,701 --> 00:23:53,000
I mean I really, back then all
of us were naive to steroids.

396
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:56,290
We really weren't as, fuck.
Here's the thing is, man, we,

397
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:00,890
you could find out like, okay, what is
Scientology based on? You could find out,

398
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,890
you could find in, okay, does
chiropractic medicine work? Right?

399
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:08,360
You could Google stuff now and you could
look, okay, does fluoride cure cavities?

400
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:12,680
Right. We didn't get, we
didn't get an answer, but we
might be able to get a sense.

401
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,760
Sure. And you also get a sense of
like, here's the critics of Mercola,

402
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:18,650
this is what their perspective is.

403
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:23,540
Here's the critics of this natural
pathic site that might say some unfounded

404
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:27,380
things about vaccinations are
about. So there's always some, it's,

405
00:24:27,381 --> 00:24:28,700
you can get a sense,
yes.

406
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:33,080
But you at least you
have a chance in 94 dude,

407
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:34,490
when I commend you didn't have a chance,

408
00:24:34,491 --> 00:24:36,530
not a chance of Anthony Robbins cassettes.

409
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:39,590
I had a fucking PTO vinyl
thing and you open it up.

410
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:42,950
They have all these different cassettes
and I would listen to those by the pool

411
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:46,020
in my shitty apartment and rotating
around. Didn't you get a lot from,

412
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:50,000
I've got a lot. He's leaches. Fuck, I
got a lot of shit like Tony Robbins.

413
00:24:50,001 --> 00:24:53,330
Tony Robbins is a bunch of people,
just a lot of shots.

414
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:57,610
Tony Robbins knows how the human
brain works. I found him in normal.

415
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,540
But there's guys that,

416
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:04,541
it's the same thing as like with musicians
or with carpenters or with comedians

417
00:25:04,551 --> 00:25:08,750
and there's people that are just kind
of bumbling through it and this people

418
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:13,130
that kill it when it comes to like the
self help, personal growth type shit,

419
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:17,270
he kills it. Here's what's interesting.
People are so goofy that you know,

420
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:19,070
he does those cold walk things.

421
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,600
These dumb motherfuckers are trying to
take selfies while they're coal walk and

422
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:27,110
they're burning their feet off cause
he's stupid fucks actually believe that

423
00:25:27,111 --> 00:25:31,400
they're the, the power of their will is
keeping them from this is how it works.

424
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,300
You Idiots. Okay. Kohl's. This is an, I
only found this out a couple of days ago.

425
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,900
Coles are not very good
at projecting heat.

426
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,110
That's why you put a
fucking frying pan down.

427
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,020
You put it that's a conductor
of heat and want that metal.

428
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,490
The metal's going to cook well, things
don't cook that good on Kohl's. Yeah,

429
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,830
it's not the same.
It's weight like got really hot.

430
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:56,831
Pan will fuck you up way quicker
than Coles so you can run on coals.

431
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,820
If you move quick, you just
got to go quick at the end
you'd be like, ah, Ooh, ah,

432
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:02,960
but you can actually do it.

433
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:05,390
If you have some calluses on
your feet and move quick enough,

434
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:08,780
you won't get burned. So, but
these dummies didn't even move.

435
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,930
They just served their fixtures.

436
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,960
Pictures on fucking coals.

437
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:18,740
I've just got the power of now
because she's doing it for them.

438
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:22,250
That's so inconvenient because
you can't walk anywhere.

439
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,050
You know Shane Mouse,
the standup comic? No,

440
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:31,210
he was hiking at night and jumped off of
like a cliff and landed on his feet and

441
00:26:35,091 --> 00:26:37,550
broke both of his feet fucking a,

442
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:41,330
he jumped and landed like 10
feet below in the mountains.

443
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:44,730
He had to figure out how to get down here.
He was just fucked up.

444
00:26:44,731 --> 00:26:48,180
He made a mistake. I forget the exact
story. Do you remember the exact story?

445
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,800
It was like a very like normal jump.

446
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:51,710
It wasn't anything crazy like
he didn't jump somewhere.

447
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:54,120
He just like dropped her
like, oh, we took a step down.

448
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,750
I might be conflating him with someone
else who was another person I know that

449
00:26:57,751 --> 00:27:02,550
fell at night and they did.
They might be a different story.

450
00:27:02,551 --> 00:27:06,870
I'm thinking of a second guy
also fell on cliffs. Either way.

451
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:11,670
Shane mouse broke both of his feet.
I think he was on crutches for six months,

452
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,180
I think. And I think it was the book
blood Meridian. And he talks about,

453
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,430
and this apparently was a
practice and as there was a tribe,

454
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,950
this cowboy gets captured by these native
Americans and native Americans killed

455
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:26,360
his whole posse. And then they take
him and they take his feet, uh,

456
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:31,390
his shoes off and they just cut
the first layer of his feet off.

457
00:27:31,711 --> 00:27:33,420
They kind of give a nice shaving.

458
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:37,380
So like just the soles of his
feet are taken off and they,

459
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:42,330
and so he would have to crawl back into
towns to explain to them who the fuck

460
00:27:42,331 --> 00:27:46,830
was out there.
We had to crawl like 10 miles and shit.

461
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,660
Oh my God. Yeah. He says, I said, I
landed a new, I broke both my heels.

462
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:55,350
My left foot was in really bad shape.
The right foot wasn't bad.

463
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,820
I could still use my right toes.

464
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:00,720
So with the help of my friend who had
the hike around the other way after we

465
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,880
decided to jump,
may not be the best idea.

466
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,050
I had to spend the next two hours scooting
down the mountain on my butt hands

467
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:12,051
and right toes until we got to a flat
enough surface where he and some strangers

468
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,860
carry me to his car.

469
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:17,250
He and his wife then had to go a couple
of hospitals until we found an er that

470
00:28:17,251 --> 00:28:21,960
was not too busy to see me. God, Whoa.
Part is, you know, it was my birthday.

471
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:24,900
Quick hike, have some Sushi, catch
a movie. Pretty low. Key night.

472
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:30,570
He looked at this shortcut. I'd want
to try and involve jumping off a cliff.

473
00:28:30,571 --> 00:28:31,920
That was about 11 feet.

474
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:36,450
I was wearing some barefoot running shoes
that were not appropriate for landing

475
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,130
and I thought it would
be too high of a jump.

476
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:41,220
We looked into for a few minutes and
talked about it and then we decided to go

477
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:44,610
for it because we were dumb
guys and that's the sort
of thing that dumb guys do,

478
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:45,121
not this.

479
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:50,121
So he jumped 11 feet onto fucking
rock in barefoot shoes and smashed.

480
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,630
Here's my question. You're so
crazy to do. Here's my question.

481
00:28:54,631 --> 00:28:58,000
Before cautious Dasia for
anesthesia and x rays.

482
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,580
When you did that go to it.

483
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,770
Well you got back to town even.
What would they do?

484
00:29:04,771 --> 00:29:08,150
Go in to just set your ankle cause
that's a, that's not a complicated joint.

485
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:11,850
He'll fuck. Fuck right.
So fun just to cripple.

486
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,090
Thinking about how tall 11 feet is.

487
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,680
Then jumping from that
down to rocks with dude,

488
00:29:16,681 --> 00:29:21,030
I don't even like running in those
barefoot. She's hard on your feet. I do.

489
00:29:21,031 --> 00:29:24,780
I run on them but I got to be careful
like where I step. I have to be careful.

490
00:29:24,781 --> 00:29:28,410
Like you got to look what you can't step
on a jagged rock cause it goes right

491
00:29:28,411 --> 00:29:30,780
now. Whereas if you're wearing
something like these, these are,

492
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,660
these are trail running shoes.
I run these,

493
00:29:33,661 --> 00:29:36,060
I can step on anything
with these fucking things.

494
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,040
So I alternate when I trail run.

495
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:42,040
I alternate with shoes like this that I
could just run anything and then those

496
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,420
vibrams or the vivo barefoot ones. But
you gotta be careful with those things.

497
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,190
Fuck jumping from 11 feet, that
basketball, I left 10 feet,

498
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,230
another foot above that is crazy. And
under rocks. That's what guys do is crazy.

499
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,600
That is such a dumb thing to do.

500
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:02,470
Breaking your feet or your ankles
or your legs or break your elbow.

501
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:05,410
You like shit broke. My elbow is still
good though. You're going to be all right.

502
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,460
Yeah,
you're going to be all right.

503
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:09,580
But you can get a blister apparently in
the wrong place when you're hiking away

504
00:30:09,581 --> 00:30:11,560
up to the mountains and it can kill you.

505
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:16,780
John can par got a blister on his
foot or a in his, the head is,

506
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:19,810
he'll crapped. Got It
infected. He was in Thailand,

507
00:30:19,811 --> 00:30:24,190
it infected and he missed his daughter's
fight and had to stay at a hospital in

508
00:30:24,191 --> 00:30:27,790
Thailand and get ivy antibiotics.
It must have been so bad.

509
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:29,230
Cause John's at night,

510
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:32,800
he's a fucking animal and his daughter's
fighting and Thailand. I mean, you know,

511
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:37,300
and he basically,
he started his whole career in Thailand,

512
00:30:37,301 --> 00:30:39,430
practically. Dude, crazy.

513
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:42,220
Its foot was all swollen up like you
gotta be careful with your feet, man.

514
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,400
Oh yeah, yeah. We'll chop off.
Cliffs had an ingrown toenail.

515
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,380
My brothers were so bad when we, when
he was in high school, I went with him.

516
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,770
Here's who kept just, they kept growing
into it. They had to take needles,

517
00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:57,980
numb his fucking underneath this
toenail and then Jank his toenails owl.

518
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:02,260
That's a trap. And then since the
tops of the toenail doesn't grow back,

519
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:06,270
so it just looks like the bottom of your
foot looks like the bottom of your feet

520
00:31:06,271 --> 00:31:09,480
a second now as no nails. Oh
my God. What, what but, but,

521
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:12,580
but that was because they were in Groner
there was no, he's born like that.

522
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:15,430
They kept growing. It kept growing
in and so he has no nails now.

523
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:20,130
No nails they took in Sinja it's very
creepy cause cause soft shit though.

524
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,010
Feels like Qualis knows,
Whoa,

525
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:26,050
my dad's got some nails
and under those nails,

526
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:29,320
toe j spot seven, eight years
of fungus, toe jam and Earl,

527
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,440
well let's just some thick now.
So he's got nails.

528
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,870
I mean it about a stick is the
lid of this table right here.

529
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,620
Roll dudes toes and their ass.

530
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:43,720
She has healed that are all cracked.
It's nice. 14 show too by the way.

531
00:31:43,721 --> 00:31:48,650
Cause his head, his foot is
that, it does, it's got a pace.

532
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:54,310
So I opened up for Brian in Chicago and
I do like this dirty pit put in the back

533
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:56,680
and his, his mom and
his dad. I'm like, oh,

534
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,050
it hit me right when they walked into it.
Oh fuck.

535
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:03,760
I just did that in front of Brian's
mom, dad, his two kids and his wife.

536
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,200
I was like, notice I just went quiet.
I was so, I was like, oh great.

537
00:32:08,201 --> 00:32:10,590
That was funny though. He got to do what
you gotta do. That's what I was like.

538
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,950
You guys decide, hey, you decided to
come. Yeah, he got to do my thing.

539
00:32:14,951 --> 00:32:18,000
I apologize and loved it. I was
so embarrassed. That's common.

540
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:21,760
You don't get mad talk now. Don't
get mad. That's great. Great shows.

541
00:32:21,761 --> 00:32:24,070
Your Dad doesn't shout out to Chicago.
Thought Thalia Hall.

542
00:32:24,071 --> 00:32:26,920
Thanks everybody for coming
out. Sold out three shows. Yes.

543
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:32,650
So when you do this now is
this a self funded thing?

544
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,900
This is a comedy dynamics.
Uh,

545
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,710
so they're doing a lot of specialists and
they did a great job. I love the space.

546
00:32:38,711 --> 00:32:42,620
It looked how many different specialties
that they done. Who's, uh, who's the 170.

547
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,910
That is incredible. That's incredible.
Yeah. They might be the most ever. Yes.

548
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:50,320
Who's done more? I don't think anybody
that's incredibly invoke Weiss.

549
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:53,600
He's great and, and uh, but they
did such a good job and I, I'm,

550
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,000
I captured everything on one to,
so I'm pumped.

551
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,590
I think it's best thing I've ever
done. That's beautiful. Yeah.

552
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:03,220
Chicago is a great fucking talented,
great guy. Love she play too.

553
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,760
I wasn't a fan too.
We did this,

554
00:33:04,761 --> 00:33:07,550
such a history of violence where
Improv was invented. I mean,

555
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:11,720
it's just a great town too. It's like,
it's got a lot of different qualities.

556
00:33:11,721 --> 00:33:16,670
It's got a bit of Midwest politeness
and it's got a big city mentality. Yep.

557
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,520
All together. It's a weird
spot. Yeah, it's weird.

558
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:22,820
It's a weird spot because it's like
a little bit of both great food,

559
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:27,470
friendliest people. People not
afraid to get fat. That is correct.

560
00:33:27,471 --> 00:33:31,070
So not afraid. Carbon
up, carb central. I mean,

561
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,010
they looked at pizza when they went.
This is not unhealthy enough

562
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:41,750
dishes at about six inches.
We had no fucking Pete's
out there, Brian. Oh my God.

563
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:45,860
Chicago's now America's rat capitol.
Chicago beats out in New York City,

564
00:33:45,861 --> 00:33:48,950
Boston and Washington DC as
America's rat capital. Okay,

565
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,580
here's the problem with this problem.

566
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:54,050
They don't know how many rats are
out there. They're just bullshitting.

567
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:57,890
I'm not doing a detailed fucking
analysis and know where they live. Yeah.

568
00:33:57,891 --> 00:33:59,630
Well how do you know how many,

569
00:33:59,631 --> 00:34:02,420
how do they really know how
many rats there are in New York?

570
00:34:02,421 --> 00:34:04,010
Cause they just guessing.
I don't think so.

571
00:34:04,011 --> 00:34:06,830
I think they can actually don't
they can't. They tell by like,

572
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:10,580
like my buddy had Allianz. What's
that? There's off of complaints.

573
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:15,040
I'll get it though. Fuck Daddy, look
at it again. Chicago's complaining more

574
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:20,440
Chicago known for being
in Boston.

575
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:25,130
I'd be scared of a fucking road. Come on
Bro. Who am I going to call about a rat?

576
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:28,160
That's why La is not other than
one kilo. My, my buddy had a,

577
00:34:28,161 --> 00:34:31,490
bought a building in New York and he
had to clean it out in the basement.

578
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,773
Jimmy Burke told me,

579
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:37,340
my buddy Steve Shakur was coming out when
they were killing them. They had this,

580
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,990
they were poisoning them.
They were coming out with garbage bags,

581
00:34:41,991 --> 00:34:45,740
the industrial size, garbage bags full
of rats. And they did it for two days.

582
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,300
It was thousands, tens of
thousands million rats, some shit.

583
00:34:50,301 --> 00:34:55,190
That documentary on Netflix.
Netflix is insane and amazing.

584
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,860
It is clean rat though. I
like man, Cutie Pie. Yeah,

585
00:34:57,861 --> 00:35:01,340
look cute that someone's got like as a
pet until they carry the bubonic plague.

586
00:35:01,341 --> 00:35:04,880
I like the white ones with red eyes.
So they decided that that's not true.

587
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:08,470
I think they decided that it was
actually a fleas that were on the rats,

588
00:35:08,471 --> 00:35:11,990
that character. It was the fleet, the
fleet. So you can't really blame the rats.

589
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:16,430
The rats carried the fleas, but that's
like we carried the bubonic plague.

590
00:35:16,431 --> 00:35:18,680
We going to blame humans for the plague.
Yes.

591
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,140
We always look to like swine flu,
Bro.

592
00:35:23,141 --> 00:35:27,290
K from the pigs has giant rat bigger
than a dog near the playground.

593
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:32,390
Nutria. That's master splintered. No,

594
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:34,590
it's a different kind of animal
to nutrients from West towns.

595
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:38,100
It's still a giant fucking version of
a Aramco. They have a lot of those,

596
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,110
you know, they're starting to see those
in Texas now in different, uh, they're,

597
00:35:41,111 --> 00:35:44,040
they're spreading across the
lower part of this country.

598
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:47,190
Can you make him pet kind of cool?
They bet pears are good.

599
00:35:47,191 --> 00:35:49,330
Eat and they're like a beaver. Yes. Yes.

600
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,970
David [inaudible] had an
episode of his TV show.

601
00:35:51,971 --> 00:35:56,550
I remember that TV show that you would
do. Yes. They went nutria hunting.

602
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:01,940
Yeah. And everywhere. I think it was
in Louisiana, I don't quite know. Got

603
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,110
talking about one of those motherfuckers
take hold. Once they're there,

604
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,970
it's real difficult to shake them off.

605
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:14,330
Rinella actually had an episode of his
podcast of about a place where they were

606
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,180
killing all the killing off the nutria
and how they figured out how to do it.

607
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:22,620
Yeah. It's a crazy thing. That little
animal. So I brought it over here.

608
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:25,470
Did you see crazy animals? I saw
your Instagram joke. How were,

609
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,390
how were the craziest animals in Thailand?

610
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:30,840
You know what the most depressing
thing was? We went to one of those, uh,

611
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:36,080
tiger sanctuary things like
drug the fuck up for sure.

612
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:41,340
Do you know why? How you can tell because
people get in there. Well first of all,

613
00:36:41,341 --> 00:36:44,970
because the the babies,
they'll let you touch the baby's first.

614
00:36:44,971 --> 00:36:48,000
There's like different packages you could
package the baby package or the young

615
00:36:48,001 --> 00:36:52,280
lion package or the giant line,
get that VIP package. I'll take,

616
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,590
I'll take the babies are adorable,
these little cute things,

617
00:36:55,591 --> 00:37:00,591
but they're super like playful and
active and big and then you get to like a

618
00:37:00,931 --> 00:37:04,260
little bigger and they seem to be
behaving normal and they have a bunch of

619
00:37:04,261 --> 00:37:05,460
trainers in there with them.

620
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:10,470
And then you get to the big ones and the
big ones are fucking doped out of their

621
00:37:10,471 --> 00:37:12,450
mind. Like they just gave
him a bucket of heroin.

622
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,140
So they're just laying there like this,
like looking at you. I believe it, dude,

623
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,760
they didn't,
none of them got up.

624
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:21,780
They just laid there and people lay next
to him and hug him and take pictures

625
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:25,920
with God. Damn Dude. But it's
weird. Kids and wife do that. No,

626
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,990
fuck that. I'm the lines like, oh fuck,
I feel better. Well the woman got,

627
00:37:30,991 --> 00:37:33,330
we were there. We didn't know
what it was until we got there.

628
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:37,200
I got super depressed like immediately,
but when we were there the the,

629
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:42,360
the oldest we got to is like a nine
month cat and that cat does not seem like

630
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:46,130
it's drugged up at all. How they're young,
they're pretty big man. Like a mastiff.

631
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,970
It'll fuck you up. Still fucked.
Well their Chai and cat still.

632
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:54,480
Oh a hundred percent fuck you up dude.
But it's like a seven month, eight month,

633
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:58,270
nine month cat in there. Like big
like a dog. The big dog. Yeah,

634
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:02,710
she got try that shit. You ever see
a massive at six months it's pretty,

635
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:07,440
pretty bad. Yeah. Six months. Yeah. Cats
bigger. So this thing is bigger than that,

636
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,990
you know, probably 175
pounds, something like that.

637
00:38:09,991 --> 00:38:13,800
200 pounds and it's just hanging around
and they have all these trainers that

638
00:38:13,801 --> 00:38:15,720
are just like around the cat all the time.
We're like,

639
00:38:15,721 --> 00:38:19,890
what in the fuck are we doing?
Like you know what? Fuck this.

640
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,980
Well they have guns and stuff.
They have like sticks with them.

641
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,560
They keep the kid that cats are
listening to them for the most part,

642
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:30,150
but then it gets to an untenable
size. Yeah. And they're also, yeah,

643
00:38:30,151 --> 00:38:32,880
and they have these things in these
cages and then there was other ones that

644
00:38:32,881 --> 00:38:34,290
clearly weren't drugged up.

645
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:39,160
Like he pass by one cage and this one's
less walking back and forth and pacing

646
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:42,700
and looking at you and looking
at everybody. I'm like,
okay, he's awake. He's legit.

647
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:45,100
He just got off his meds.
Yeah.

648
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,400
And these other ones are
just dragged down like this.

649
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,950
It is a drag wife bummed out
to everybody was bummed out.

650
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,100
Everybody was pumped out. It's a
drag man. That's a big found one.

651
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:00,490
That was a selling tiger parts.
Sure man.

652
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:06,230
People are poor. They're taking risks
ladder and shit. Not Good. The other,

653
00:39:06,231 --> 00:39:10,630
the bear gallbladders apparently such
an issue that like some Asian countries

654
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:14,680
want bare gallbladder. Uh,
some people like it. It's
like some sort of a delicacy.

655
00:39:14,681 --> 00:39:16,660
It's supposed to have some
weird properties to it.

656
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:19,810
Probably like probably like
Rhino Horn type properties.

657
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,160
But it's so bad that in British
Columbia, if you hunt bear, I say,

658
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:26,740
if you want a black bear, you're not
allowed to open up the body cavity. Okay.

659
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:28,540
You have to take the meat off the outside.

660
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:31,150
You can't even go into the
body cavity. Wow. Yeah.

661
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:34,480
They have a law against it because
they don't want people harvesting bear

662
00:39:34,481 --> 00:39:37,180
gallbladders back and they don't
want people killing them. Yes.

663
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:41,800
Bear Bile does have additional uses,
but there are cruelty free alternatives.

664
00:39:41,801 --> 00:39:45,340
Bear bile has been used in traditional
Asian medicine for thousands of years,

665
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:48,780
contains high levels of
good luck. This word, Urso,

666
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:54,030
deoxycholic acid known to be useful
for treating liver and gallbladder

667
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:59,210
conditions, so it does have
some medicinal value to tail,

668
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:03,970
but I had friends that were bear hunting
and people were asking them for the

669
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:06,670
gallbladders and they were like, it's
illegal. He's like, God, just get it.

670
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:09,460
Get it from my grandma. You know,
she really likes it. You know, like,

671
00:40:09,461 --> 00:40:12,790
get the fuck Outta here, man. That's
like, it's a bad thing to have,

672
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,080
but I'll give you get caught with it.

673
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:17,020
It's like you're getting caught
with something you're not,

674
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,840
it's not legal to possess a
part of an animal that you're,

675
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,780
it's legal to for you to kill it.
And that's what's crazy.

676
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,840
Stop and think about that. Yeah, you
can kill it. You can kill the animal.

677
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:29,980
You just can't possess a part of its
body. Yeah. You're not allowed to get,

678
00:40:29,981 --> 00:40:34,000
you're not allowed to open his calf.
Not that I know.

679
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:37,780
It goes to waste.
You could use it,

680
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:41,740
but you can't use it because
so many people want it that
they made it illegal to

681
00:40:41,741 --> 00:40:44,740
have it. Wow. Because bile is
always been used. Apparently.

682
00:40:44,741 --> 00:40:48,500
I said one of the compounds or whoever
it is. That's good. Birth control.

683
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:53,200
It's your mouth. Oh, be want to. No,

684
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:57,500
but it's used for like medicine, you know,
some medicines like anti disinfectant.

685
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,820
Yeah. Bio was always a traditional
medicine that actually worked.

686
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:03,670
I mean if you mixed it with
the hose down there though,

687
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:04,870
I love that was way different.

688
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:08,830
The elephant was a really positive
experience because the elephants are in a

689
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:11,290
Rehab Center where they actually intrude,
reintroduce them back to the wild.

690
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:16,420
And we see the way these people, first
of all, they're not contained. They roam.

691
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:20,230
Yeah. Not only do they roam,
they, they, there's no fence.

692
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:23,860
They let people in when the florist
bro, they come out of the forest. Yeah.

693
00:41:23,861 --> 00:41:28,090
The people are all there with them,
like moving care of them, feeding them.

694
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:31,390
They're constantly giving them sugar
cane, washing them, cleaning them.

695
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,730
And when you're there, like
they, they document their,

696
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:39,560
they're trying to explain how all the
money that you pay for to experience

697
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,380
hanging out with these elephants
for a day goes to rehabilitation.

698
00:41:43,381 --> 00:41:44,460
And we talked about all the different,

699
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:48,440
it goes to food and they've reintroduced
seven elephants into the wild through

700
00:41:48,441 --> 00:41:53,110
this one facility, which is giant. It's
a live wild. So they're in Thailand? Yes.

701
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:57,580
There's a lot of elephants. And so
while the, where these people are, the,

702
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:01,460
the forest is like super dense man and
the elephants just wander through the

703
00:42:01,461 --> 00:42:05,180
forest eating whatever the fuck they
want it is. It's crazy to see men.

704
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:08,540
So the kind of wild, they're wild.
They're wild, but they're not,

705
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:13,640
a lot of them came from zoos. A lot of
them came from circuses, but they can be,

706
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,310
they look, they're basically
living like they would in the wild,

707
00:42:16,311 --> 00:42:20,330
so it's not a giant stretch to take them
and reintroduce them to a place as long

708
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:25,110
as there's food there. Fairly tame.
The wild. They just traded big dude.

709
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:28,790
They do whatever the fuck they want
and grab them. They're fucking trunks.

710
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:30,710
Are they soft? No. It's hard as a rock.

711
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:34,220
There's 600 muscles in their
trunk alone and no bones,

712
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,890
600 muscles just in the trunk.

713
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,950
Just so physical strength is so
insane. Dude. It's so hard when you,

714
00:42:41,951 --> 00:42:44,330
when you were around them
and you realize like, Oh God,

715
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:47,510
like you shouldn't I the
riding and was sketchy.

716
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:50,270
Like it's sketchy because you
worry. Well good. If they fall,

717
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:55,310
like one of them slipped a little bit
con itself and one lady did fall off and

718
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,980
she was okay,
but it's,

719
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,410
it's a possibility that you could
fall off of the fucking elephant,

720
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:04,940
which you are. You're 10 feet up. Yeah.
I mean these are just some of them.

721
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:09,080
This one lady had a, I had a female
that I was riding this one lady,

722
00:43:09,081 --> 00:43:12,680
and you're only riding it for like you
in a basket weaving a basket or just on

723
00:43:12,681 --> 00:43:14,500
it and you just on it
really holding onto a rope.

724
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:18,980
They put a rope around the waist
and you hold onto the rope.

725
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:23,210
It's like loosely around
that. You've barely on man.
Yeah, you're barely on. Wow.

726
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,450
You know, they just, and if they
wanted you off, you're off instantly.

727
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:29,660
You weigh nothing to them
or feels like on my back,

728
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:31,670
itches came over to what I had was,

729
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:37,440
and the one this lady had next to me
was literally 30% 40% larger than hers.

730
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:42,050
It was so big and it was a male. And when
it trumpets, when it just decided, okay,

731
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:48,150
like right next to everybody.
Everybody wanted more stuff so loud.

732
00:43:48,151 --> 00:43:51,870
You just realize what it is. I think
it was, it was raining every day.

733
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:52,870
It rains constantly.

734
00:43:52,871 --> 00:43:56,410
This is a rainy season two
and this elephant is moving
through the mist and the

735
00:43:56,411 --> 00:44:00,640
forest and just eating whatever it
wants or these giant white tusks.

736
00:44:00,641 --> 00:44:03,940
And I'm like,
that is a crazy living being.

737
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:06,970
That's a crazy majestic animal.
Have you seen them?

738
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,930
It was dope.
Have you seen the video where it,

739
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:14,480
where there's a bull elephant hitting
I'd Mack truck. Oh yeah. Just,

740
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:16,050
oh it trucks it over.

741
00:44:16,051 --> 00:44:20,150
Cause they've added a bunch of them in
India where they get tired of being a

742
00:44:20,151 --> 00:44:21,840
boot abused and they just go nuts.

743
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,870
But with this thing that
these animals were loved,

744
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,230
like you could really tell like first
of all you forced them with your hands.

745
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,140
You know that when we give them
sugar cane, you're so scared.

746
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,820
Cause his mouth is giant.

747
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,210
But you put it in there and
they're just super gentleman.

748
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:40,020
They don't snap out of nothing.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's soft.

749
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:42,010
I mean it's,
it's not like it's like a bowling,

750
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,330
but the trunk is insanely powerful.

751
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,320
They just grab shit with that thing
and rip it out of the room. Cool.

752
00:44:49,321 --> 00:44:54,321
Animals snap things like blogs and shit
with their trunks and they walk and feel

753
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:57,870
like what humans feel like when one
dies, they mourn shit of it. Yeah. Well,

754
00:44:57,871 --> 00:45:01,470
they definitely have incredible memories
because there was one video of an

755
00:45:01,471 --> 00:45:06,180
elephant meeting and elephant that had
been separated from for 20 years and they

756
00:45:06,181 --> 00:45:09,670
met each other and they run to each
other and they're bouncing around. Yeah,

757
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,140
they recognize each other.
I like this really calm,

758
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,710
weird animal that eats everything.
Dude.

759
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:18,570
You realize like one of
the things I was thinking,

760
00:45:18,571 --> 00:45:21,630
I was like imagine if you had one
of these that lived in your yard.

761
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:26,070
You had to have no yard. No. This is the
problem that people have in Africa. Kay.

762
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,490
I'm a giant fan of elephants.

763
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:34,420
But if you're a poor farmer and
you live in this prior crop, yeah,

764
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,550
just come right through your cross.
You can't do anything about it.

765
00:45:38,551 --> 00:45:39,870
You're starving.
You have children.

766
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:43,560
Imagine you have your little boy and
your little boy is going to go hungry now

767
00:45:43,561 --> 00:45:45,600
cause he's elephants just
want to eat whatever the fuck.

768
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,350
They don't understand that you
can grow this elephant. Huh?

769
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:53,030
Well elephant is the argument
for controlling some of the pop.

770
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,760
See Cause we always think we say,
oh elephants are endangered.

771
00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:00,270
Well they definitely are. Then
some places, but in other places,

772
00:46:00,271 --> 00:46:04,590
in certain areas to call
large populations, you got
to realize how big Africa is.

773
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:07,490
I mean, if you ever see like
the map or they take America,

774
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:11,270
they put it inside of Africa and they'd
put Asian side of Africa. Now let me see,

775
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:14,410
I have not seen that. Oh
my God, Africa's giant.

776
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,140
[inaudible] do we have to kill them?
Can't we redirect these fuckers?

777
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:20,280
So a lot of money to do. That's the
problem. The real problem is the money.

778
00:46:20,281 --> 00:46:20,631
Cause you,

779
00:46:20,631 --> 00:46:24,960
you could maybe could grab them and
capture them and move them fucking hell.

780
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:28,590
Yeah. Maybe that's how they do it.
And they put them in a zoo. I mean,

781
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:29,990
there has to be some capital,

782
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,420
very short distance with
that tranquilizer higher.

783
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:39,460
So big cloth underneath. And now
looking back at that, look how big our,

784
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:43,860
that's not true. Yes it is. Is broke.
Africa. Africa is so big, dude.

785
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,450
Is that true? Yep. It has all of China
in it. All of the United States. Yup.

786
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:52,740
Yup. Come of India. I'm
amazing that all of Japan,

787
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:55,850
all Spain too. That's not
to dude. All of Italy.

788
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:01,020
Dude, why does it have Japan? It
didn't make the high Japan's over. No,

789
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,730
I made it up. Japan is the
bottle, so that's real. That's,

790
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,970
that's insane man.
That's so big. So, okay.

791
00:47:08,971 --> 00:47:13,760
So imagine United States.
Imagine if we are over here in,

792
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:17,910
uh, California and we're
like, Ooh, I don't see any
fucking elephants. Meanwhile,

793
00:47:17,911 --> 00:47:22,590
in New York, they're just getting trampled
through Manhattan. Elif and we're like,

794
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:27,440
don't kill the orphans, Bro. They're
nowhere to look. Well, Calabasas,

795
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:31,480
you don't see a single fucking elephant
man. Don't be an asshole. Meanwhile,

796
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:33,900
your grantees getting
stomped. It does, it works

797
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:39,730
because there's very little continuous
habitat for the migrations apparently.

798
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:43,650
Well, yeah, I think there's a lot
of problems with, with, you know,

799
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:47,190
the places where they're underpopulated
the places where they're overpopulated.

800
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,730
It's just, it's, you know, it's just
a, it's a crazy, amazing animal.

801
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,190
It would be really nice if people could
figure out a way to live in peace with

802
00:47:55,191 --> 00:47:59,980
OE exists. It is. They were saying any
animal to be around. They were saying how,

803
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:02,050
uh, I was watching this on
animal plant or some shit,

804
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,710
but you know how they take out the bull
elephants and people are cool with it

805
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:09,400
cause you know they killed the smaller
ones are they fucked things up.

806
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,180
They're saying the problem with that with
elephants is those older ones know the

807
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:16,900
path to water and where to go.
And when you kill the older ones,

808
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,850
the other ones don't know
where the files go teach.

809
00:48:18,851 --> 00:48:22,240
The younger ones had behaved so,
so they watched their like pass.

810
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,840
Once you take out the bull and they're,

811
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:27,160
they're fun because they're saying the
older ones have so much knowledge to drop

812
00:48:27,161 --> 00:48:28,240
on these little bastards.

813
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:31,540
We have certain animals that we get
super mad if someone kills an elephant is

814
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:35,350
one of them. And a giraffe was another one
fuck yet, because they're not, you know,

815
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,940
they're not,
they're not predators.

816
00:48:36,941 --> 00:48:39,460
You know what I read about that giraffe
that that lady killed and she got in

817
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:43,360
trouble. Here's the one. It was
a giant old 18 year old giraffe.

818
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:46,300
It was killing young males,
killed three young males.

819
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:47,480
They were going to have to kill it anyway.
Yeah.

820
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:49,900
So that's how they get a person
like that to do it. You know,

821
00:48:49,901 --> 00:48:53,110
the only other option is they could take
it and put it in some sort of a zoo,

822
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,730
but it was a non-viable mail. And when
non-viable males around young males,

823
00:48:57,731 --> 00:48:59,950
apparently they kill him. They
all sit. Don't mention that,

824
00:48:59,951 --> 00:49:04,430
that that revenue she paid, you pay a
lot of money to kill the $50,000. A lot.

825
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:07,960
That revenue goes back
into the community there.

826
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:10,570
And I guess there's no such thing
as a black giraffe and was like,

827
00:49:10,571 --> 00:49:14,810
that's a black dress. Like No. Well
when they get old they get darker. Yeah.

828
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:18,610
But it's really rare that an animal
in the wild gets to 18 years old.

829
00:49:18,611 --> 00:49:21,910
Fucking big. Huge. But again,
when you kill off that big,

830
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,580
mainly a lot of knowledge to drop
on these other little [inaudible],

831
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:29,720
he wasn't dropping any
knowledge. She's killing us.
See, they're different. That it,

832
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:33,250
that's the reason why that Cory
Knowlton, I think that was his name. Um,

833
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:38,320
he got in trouble for shooting that
rhino a pay $250,000 to shoot a rhino.

834
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,670
It was,
it was,

835
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:44,770
they were going to have to kill it because
it did killed a male and it killed a

836
00:49:44,771 --> 00:49:49,360
female kill the male breeding her and
it killed a young, uh, no killed him,

837
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:52,330
a female breeding her and it killed
the young man and he was so old.

838
00:49:52,331 --> 00:49:55,120
He paid I think $391,000 or
something crazy like that.

839
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:59,320
Is he just scrooge McDuck rich, he wants
to kill the oils family. He's balling.

840
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:02,920
And you wanted to kill the rhinos, that
pad. Is that his name to hunter? Yeah,

841
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:06,290
I talked to him. We had it on the
podcast. Really Smart Guy. But not,

842
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:09,040
not what you think when you
think of a guy who, you know,

843
00:50:09,041 --> 00:50:10,060
does something like that,

844
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:13,360
but his nature not going to take care
of itself with these rails. Now they're,

845
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:17,230
they're so endangered cause the rhinos
or the rhinos are so endangered that it's

846
00:50:17,231 --> 00:50:20,390
very dangerous to just let nature
take its course out because nature,

847
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:23,560
the animals have gone extinct. You
know, if you really go over the,

848
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:27,320
the list of animals that have been
extinct just by will, we've been alive.

849
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:28,070
You don't think about

850
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:32,240
it. But there's been a lot. And then if
you look over the course of human history,

851
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:34,840
fuck man,
a lot of animals have gone extinct.

852
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:38,690
Should have not living in a natural
habitat anyway. Then their, their,

853
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:41,560
their habitat has been so fucked with,
to begin with of us.

854
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,210
And there's so few aisles back in the day,
yes,

855
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,120
the nature would have found its way.
But when you have the thing,

856
00:50:47,121 --> 00:50:50,720
is this guys 300 grand or whatever it
is that's going to go directly into

857
00:50:50,721 --> 00:50:54,080
keeping those other ones a lie.
I think I have plenty for the scientists.

858
00:50:54,081 --> 00:50:57,530
They're going to have money for it.
He'll type poaching efforts. It's just,

859
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:59,290
it seems counterintuitive.
I know.

860
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,750
It seems you're natural instinct when
they post it on the gram, like, oh,

861
00:51:02,751 --> 00:51:05,570
just fucking killed this black
drafts. Like God damn bitch. Right.

862
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,640
And why would you,
why would you want to shoot a giraffe?

863
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:12,400
Why would you want to shoot a rhino? I
kid, I get it, man. It's, uh, but it's,

864
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:17,420
it's more complicated than you think it
is. Yeah. You know what I'm suspect of?

865
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:20,540
You know, there's poachers that
were killed by those lions. Yeah.

866
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:25,040
I don't think that happened. I think
they got shot. Your conspiracy guys,

867
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,260
I think they got shot by
poachers and the posters,

868
00:51:27,261 --> 00:51:31,670
like it's a lot easier just to say
that they got eaten by lions out.

869
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:34,100
I will tell you as a fact,

870
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:38,960
I know people that have gone over there
to hunt and they just shoot at poachers.

871
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:43,640
Just shoot at them. Yeah. And
obviously we're talking about Africa.

872
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:47,390
So now you normous enormous place.
So I mean,

873
00:51:47,391 --> 00:51:51,200
it might not feel like they're starting
hunters and gatherers and kill poachers.

874
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:53,810
It's entirely possible that that happens.
So hunting,

875
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:57,410
but I'm saying that the people that are
the professionals that work on those

876
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,370
giant ranches, like there's a lot
of these private hunting ranches,

877
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:03,890
they're like hundreds of
thousands of acres even in,

878
00:52:03,891 --> 00:52:07,100
they're all fenced in and
people get inside and they
poach. What does that mean?

879
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:10,730
That means they're trying to eat right.
You know, it means they're starving.

880
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,600
And a lot of times,

881
00:52:11,601 --> 00:52:13,850
and they're trying to do whatever
the fuck they can to make money.

882
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:17,330
Whether they can make money by chopping
off a rhino horn where they make money

883
00:52:17,331 --> 00:52:19,880
by selling meat from some
antelope that they shot.

884
00:52:19,881 --> 00:52:21,930
They weren't supposed to
shoot, but my, what I,

885
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:26,950
my point is that people have told me
that they know of these people over there

886
00:52:27,141 --> 00:52:30,710
shooting at poachers, just shooting
at them like you would shoot at a,

887
00:52:30,711 --> 00:52:35,520
a rat or a coyote or something that was
trying to eat your chickens or something.

888
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:38,840
Of course you shoot him the lines
and come along. We might be right.

889
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:40,950
It feels like my friend,

890
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,850
my friend who was over there
said he couldn't believe it,

891
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:48,170
that they just will shoot at poachers.
Danielle was shooting youtube.

892
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,680
I was gonna say pictures. No, that's
right. They're also part of it.

893
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:53,870
Some of them are organized gangs and man,
you know,

894
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:54,980
it's one of those things were like,

895
00:52:54,981 --> 00:52:57,830
what would you do if you
were in that village?

896
00:52:57,831 --> 00:53:01,790
You'd be in that fucking organized
gang to price stay out of Africa. Well,

897
00:53:01,791 --> 00:53:06,320
if you're born there, but I'm saying
us. Oh well how about malaria?

898
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,750
Which has killed half of the
people that have ever died ever.

899
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:11,360
You have to get all those shots go.
My wife's doing that right now.

900
00:53:11,361 --> 00:53:16,250
She's going to Kenya first
class, first class safari.

901
00:53:16,251 --> 00:53:18,710
I can't make it. I've got
to go to China, Beijing,

902
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:22,580
there's no matter which one's worse.
Yo, here's the thing about China.

903
00:53:22,581 --> 00:53:27,300
We had a stop in, in China, they have
different sense of personal space.

904
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:31,680
Like as far as like getting in between
you and align. They don't give a fuck.

905
00:53:31,681 --> 00:53:34,380
You walking through a thing and
then just like a merging thing.

906
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:37,710
There's no merging sign. They're going to
go right into the kids. Right into you,

907
00:53:37,711 --> 00:53:42,270
your wife. They drive like
that. But they're not,

908
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,970
they're not rude.
It's just a different way.

909
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,450
Cause there's so many people have to
figure it out. Exactly. Here's a billing.

910
00:53:48,451 --> 00:53:50,760
They're not,
they're not impolite people,

911
00:53:50,761 --> 00:53:54,240
but they get misconstrued as being
impolite cause we're not used to that.

912
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:58,140
Navigating that kind of numbers like
they are. It's crazy to see though, man.

913
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,540
Watch them. Even if you're just
watching them do it with other people,

914
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:03,760
just walk right in front of people and
smash into each other. If you do that,

915
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:09,540
you'd be like, fuck man, get mad at you.
When I went to Australia, a lot of, uh,

916
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,350
Chinese and Japanese and Koreans were
on holiday in Australia and I was with

917
00:54:13,351 --> 00:54:17,580
Chin. Who's Korean? My producer, and
they've kept their super, we'd be in line,

918
00:54:17,581 --> 00:54:21,090
they'd bump into someone. I'm
like, dude, what the fuck?
And he's like, no, no, no, no.

919
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,700
They're not being disrespectful. It's
literally just how, that's how they,

920
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:28,600
that's how they grew up. They just got
stood out. Stupid numbers of people. We,

921
00:54:28,601 --> 00:54:31,680
you get used to people bumping into
each other a little bit about your way.

922
00:54:31,681 --> 00:54:35,900
There's none of them. India is kind
of similar, leaving stack behind you.

923
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:38,880
Really close to them. This is the
art. I mean this is the trend, right?

924
00:54:38,881 --> 00:54:41,820
The argument is that you get too many
people and then the people lose their

925
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:44,570
value because they become a hindrance.
Like I was thinking that yesterday.

926
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:48,570
I was at the four oh five, it's six
o'clock yesterday. Oh, you've been there.

927
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:52,410
It is a crazy thing to experience because
I was looking to get into it after

928
00:54:52,411 --> 00:54:52,980
this.
But yeah,

929
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:57,540
it also makes you think like if there
was an end of the world type scenario and

930
00:54:57,541 --> 00:55:01,080
you were trying to get back to your
family, right, you got zero chance.

931
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:05,010
You gotta you're gonna, you're gonna walk
way quicker. The 20 miles of your house.

932
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:09,750
You want to get a helicopter,
bro. Bilberry has one.

933
00:55:09,751 --> 00:55:13,320
He flies on around, but he doesn't
have his own. He took lessons.

934
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,440
Bill knows how to fly bills on a
helicopter. He flies all the time. Right?

935
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:19,590
All the time. He flew down to San
Diego for a Gig and flew back.

936
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:22,890
Really cool. Yeah. It's funny.

937
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:27,360
I flew from San Diego to La.
Don't ask me how and why, but it,

938
00:55:27,361 --> 00:55:31,640
my plan had a stop over in San
Diego, 26 minutes. That's hilarious.

939
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:35,730
That's a hilarious flight. Six
hours we'll be, we'll be unfair.

940
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:40,440
So you get that traffic, it's six hours.
You've got to plan that motherfucker.

941
00:55:40,441 --> 00:55:43,050
Correct. Because at the comedy store
at La Jolla, the Thursday night show,

942
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:46,530
eight o'clock I was like, oh dude, if
I leave by two we got this all day.

943
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:51,030
I got there right at eight right?
It took you six hours.

944
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:54,450
There's accidents off. Oh my
God. Then I had to take, right.

945
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:58,890
When you get into San Diego,
orange county,

946
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,680
Orange County has so many people
and it's like a little China.

947
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:05,400
It's gorgeous though. It's so key.
It's beautiful, but it's so crazy.

948
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:08,610
You go there and like just the density
of people in Orange. Kind of like,

949
00:56:08,611 --> 00:56:11,250
wait a minute, how many people
are here? This is a crazy spot,

950
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:14,640
but then there's some dope spots
like learning the Gal. Oh yeah.

951
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:18,470
I like to come to Chicago to go 11
miles took us an hour and a half ago.

952
00:56:18,471 --> 00:56:20,760
We're traffic. Ever.
See my left? No, dude,

953
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:25,060
it can't be worse than going through
Orange County at five o'clock it's no

954
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:29,680
fucking bad. I asked the Uber. It
does. I said, is it always like this?

955
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:33,880
And they said it's like this because
of the construction right now in 2015,

956
00:56:33,881 --> 00:56:37,420
three point 17 million
people just in Orange County.

957
00:56:37,421 --> 00:56:42,280
And that does not include Mexicans.
It's just does not,

958
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:46,150
they don't know. They don't have a
fucking clue. And when I say Mexicans,

959
00:56:46,151 --> 00:56:50,030
I should say, he people will let you
in. You're here. All right. That's,

960
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:52,510
that's what they should say.
Hey, you're here. You get in.

961
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:56,740
But the point is all these, uh, these
numbers are inflated. Like how many,

962
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:59,690
how many more illegal aliens
are here on top of that night.

963
00:56:59,691 --> 00:57:01,990
But I live in Orange County.
If I didn't have to work in La,

964
00:57:01,991 --> 00:57:04,600
I'd live in Orange County. What do you
mean? I would, I would live there all day.

965
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:08,320
I would live there. All loved Newport
best. What do you think the numbers are?

966
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:13,030
How many people, how many illegal aliens
do you think are in Orange County?

967
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:16,750
I was 3.1 7 million people.

968
00:57:16,751 --> 00:57:19,300
How many people do you think
are illegal aliens? 67 million.

969
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:24,550
Like I feel like it's
one of those numbers,

970
00:57:24,551 --> 00:57:28,240
like if they're documented or
undocumented, like how are you guessing?

971
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:31,600
It fluctuates. Probably. I don't want
to compare them to the rat study.

972
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,160
So disrespectful thing. I'm just
mean in terms of a study. Do we go,

973
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:38,970
you're not actually monitoring, like
how do you, how the fuck do you know?

974
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:42,980
We know how many they think or they
estimate sneak across every year. Yes.

975
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:46,540
Good question. I think they do. Do we have
any idea Jamie? Because then we could,

976
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:48,130
I have no fucking clue.

977
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:52,480
You imagine if you were living in some
shit country and you realize that you

978
00:57:52,481 --> 00:57:54,860
could actually get a great job if
you could just get across the river.

979
00:57:54,861 --> 00:57:59,260
It's such a bummer. Yeah. What's so
heartbreaking? What a shit we got to,

980
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:02,440
but meanwhile there's some
sweet spots down there like,

981
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:06,580
why don't we gentrify Mexico? Well, that's
the thing. Mexico City's getting there.

982
00:58:06,581 --> 00:58:06,761
Yeah.

983
00:58:06,761 --> 00:58:10,720
Mexico City's economy's doing a Pr
Mexico's economy is doing pretty well from

984
00:58:10,721 --> 00:58:13,380
what I hear this, you got
Nicaragua, El Salvador, this is,

985
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:16,420
this is in 2014 so triple it.

986
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:21,340
It's two thousand two million three
hundred fifty thousand just in southern

987
00:58:21,341 --> 00:58:24,840
California. Look at Delaware
just alone. Yeah, I know,

988
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,100
but that's the entire state of California.

989
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:32,130
That's off by a factor of 10 by
2.3 million to Orange County. Yeah.

990
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:35,240
There's no way they know.
They don't know mad if they need,

991
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:37,020
they ship a lot of the economy though.

992
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:42,010
They make up 11 million total of our
agricultural economy and everything else.

993
00:58:42,011 --> 00:58:45,100
Man. We need those right
now. They're in trench.

994
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:48,340
It's heartbreaking when they have to
pass the rivers in the body of water and

995
00:58:48,341 --> 00:58:53,260
it's like kids and women, they
die in the fucking heartbreaking.

996
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,770
Yeah, I mean it, and they got
to put together, you know,

997
00:58:55,900 --> 00:59:00,130
the average is $3,000 $3,000 to them.
They come from nothing.

998
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:03,400
So they save all this money.
It's per person. So you got kids,

999
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:06,940
yet the family get together, they
get robbed, they go, they get robbed.

1000
00:59:06,941 --> 00:59:10,840
All their shit. It's, some of it's fake.
They don't know who to deal with. Well,

1001
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:15,130
I'm sure you've seen videos of
Syrian refugees washing up on shore.

1002
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:19,650
I can't handle it. It's hard. You
got to, you know, and it's so easy,

1003
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:21,980
such a trash.
It's so easy to to

1004
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,440
like look at them and they
speak a different language.

1005
00:59:24,441 --> 00:59:25,880
They follow different religion.

1006
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:30,030
It's so easy to not [inaudible]

1007
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:35,180
not for you.
You're a compassionate person.

1008
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:39,920
So cosmopolitan to Syrians were not
religious searings where entrepreneurs,

1009
00:59:39,921 --> 00:59:44,570
I mean it, Damascus was a huge city.
I mean it's beautiful place. Very,

1010
00:59:44,571 --> 00:59:46,130
very cosmopolitan.
Basically European.

1011
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:49,880
Not to let them in because we're scared
that you know the tears, stuff like that.

1012
00:59:49,881 --> 00:59:52,640
That's like not letting the
talent talented because the mafia,

1013
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:54,840
it's gets such us in
a way fucking percent.

1014
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,220
It's not necessarily but not the scene.

1015
00:59:57,230 --> 01:00:01,040
All I'm saying though like that to assume
that all Mexicans are in the cartel or

1016
01:00:01,041 --> 01:00:04,820
all, all Italians are in the mafia.
It's fucking insane. It's a similar,

1017
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:08,900
it's a similar thing,
but it's especially like the thing,

1018
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:12,170
the difference between Syrians
and Mexicans is Mexicans.

1019
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,590
A lot of people would accept
them easier because they,

1020
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,300
they practice the same religion.

1021
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:21,440
Like if you found a guy who was a
Mexican businessman in Mexico City and he

1022
01:00:21,441 --> 01:00:25,080
speaks English and Spanish and his
children are well educated and you want to

1023
01:00:25,081 --> 01:00:28,330
move next door to you, we're more familiar
with Santa Monica, you'd be pumped.

1024
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:31,970
Like he's a good guy. Yeah. He came
over from Mexico. Super Nice Guy.

1025
01:00:31,971 --> 01:00:35,900
Makes his own wine, you know, you know
what I mean? But, but if a guy does,

1026
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:39,590
Mexican food is part of
the American fabric hundred
percent you know what I mean?

1027
01:00:39,591 --> 01:00:42,740
So we were not as threatened. They're
our neighbors. There's a history.

1028
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:43,983
What are you threatened?

1029
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:47,260
We'll people are threatened by Muslims
were threatened with, well they're,

1030
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:52,070
they're threatened by a radical Islamic
terrorist are threatened by the idea of

1031
01:00:52,071 --> 01:00:56,540
people trying to be like some Manchurian
candidate and get into office.

1032
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:59,060
A lot of these schools,
the school shoe with the mass shooters,

1033
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,470
a lot of them are white too.
Man. We're scared of the,

1034
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:02,960
most of them are white going.

1035
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:06,530
Well do you remember when people
were absolutely convinced that, uh,

1036
01:01:06,531 --> 01:01:09,710
Obama was somehow some sort of
a Mexican plant, or excuse me,

1037
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:13,930
Islamic plan and that he was a Manchurian
candidate and you can't get into

1038
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:18,200
office. Trump said he was from
Kenya. That was, Trump was a birther,

1039
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:22,010
people forgot about that. He had to
show his brush wanting to play him.

1040
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,670
But he might have actually believed that.

1041
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:30,790
But it also might've been that Trump like
fucking with Obama because Obama like

1042
01:01:30,981 --> 01:01:32,060
fucking with Trump.
True.

1043
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:35,150
And that's one of the things I get that
press corpse dinner where he got up and

1044
01:01:35,151 --> 01:01:35,331
said,

1045
01:01:35,331 --> 01:01:38,150
here's one thing that I am that you'll
never be as president of United States.

1046
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:41,280
And he got this giant laugh like
Seth Meyers roasted him too.

1047
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:46,370
He's like, Oh really? Oh that's
cute. That's cute. Guess what?

1048
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:49,700
Just why be the fucking president?
But he that,

1049
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:52,010
so when he said something about Obama,

1050
01:01:52,011 --> 01:01:57,011
it more than likely it was because of
a personal feud and less likely that he

1051
01:01:57,921 --> 01:01:59,440
actually thought Obama was from Kenya.

1052
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:04,430
He was probably fucking with him back
100%. Yeah, because he's a powerful guy.

1053
01:02:04,431 --> 01:02:06,590
And if they treat him like he's
not a powerful guy, he's like, oh,

1054
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,890
read his resources to so he's like,
what this,

1055
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:12,980
this is my problem with anti-Trump.
Like when,

1056
01:02:12,981 --> 01:02:14,810
when when people go too far with it,

1057
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:17,510
it's not that he's not
doing terrible things.

1058
01:02:17,511 --> 01:02:20,220
It's not that he's not like just
the idea that he lies all the time,

1059
01:02:20,221 --> 01:02:22,560
that you have to check them on his lies.
You have to figure out what's the truth,

1060
01:02:22,561 --> 01:02:25,270
what's, it's a very dangerous
but separating the immigrant.

1061
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:28,350
My issue has nothing to do with that.
My issue has to do with,

1062
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:33,351
it's a terrible way to interact with
someone whose ideas you don't like because

1063
01:02:33,661 --> 01:02:36,420
it just makes the people that
support him more aggressive.

1064
01:02:36,421 --> 01:02:39,870
Everybody gets more aggressive. You get
more aggressive at them and you'll like,

1065
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:42,280
this is what we're going to do.
We're going to shout him down.

1066
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,130
We're going to stop
them off from speaking.

1067
01:02:44,131 --> 01:02:47,940
We're going to who we're going to show
up at their their restaurants and yell at

1068
01:02:47,941 --> 01:02:51,450
them. You're just creating
more conflict. This is helping.

1069
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:54,770
This is not helping because they're
going to bolster their resource and not

1070
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:56,970
persuading and build up their defenses.
No,

1071
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:01,080
you're not Asian people and you're
going to make people arm themselves and

1072
01:03:01,081 --> 01:03:04,380
you're going to make people escalate
their rhetoric and it's going to escalate

1073
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:04,860
on both sides.

1074
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:07,890
And it's also evidence that
you're unhinged so they
can point to the fact that

1075
01:03:07,891 --> 01:03:10,830
they're right because you're harassing
them in the parking lot of a restaurant

1076
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,650
and you won't let them get to their car
without you yelling at them. They're,

1077
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:14,461
they're now saying,

1078
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:17,220
you're unhinged and there's evidence
to prove that they've got a point.

1079
01:03:17,221 --> 01:03:19,990
You're like, no, no, no, no. It's
a, this is a never Trump movement.

1080
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:23,790
We're a part of the movement and
we got together in person. Yeah,

1081
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:27,450
you're making them angry and they're
going to harass liberals now and now we

1082
01:03:27,451 --> 01:03:31,710
have this giant conflict instead of just
communicating about important issues,

1083
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:34,110
instead of just like trying to figure
out how we all get along, nothing,

1084
01:03:34,111 --> 01:03:35,760
how to solve problems and solve problems.

1085
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:38,520
Digging your heels in
one team and the other.

1086
01:03:38,521 --> 01:03:42,330
You've got to try to solve problems,
but it's way easier. Persuasions,

1087
01:03:42,331 --> 01:03:45,840
the hardest thing, punishment,
destructions ways here. Here's the thing,

1088
01:03:45,841 --> 01:03:47,760
if they get him out of office,
here's the thing.

1089
01:03:47,761 --> 01:03:51,390
If they do succeed in getting them out
of office, those even more emboldened,

1090
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:54,870
but my point is there'll be even more
emboldened that this is a correct way to

1091
01:03:54,871 --> 01:03:57,690
behave. Yes. I don't
think it necessarily is.

1092
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:02,810
I think all of the things that are
calling out that are like ink with whether

1093
01:04:02,851 --> 01:04:05,940
it's, I don't understand the Russian
stuff. I've tried to go over it.

1094
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:08,010
I feel like if there was like,

1095
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:11,580
if there was clear enough evidence
that he had committed a crime,

1096
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:13,330
they would have already
done so you'd be out. Yeah,

1097
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,830
there's too much resource and time going
into it, but there's many indictments,

1098
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:20,280
so there's other people around him that
have done something that was illegal.

1099
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:23,490
This is, this seems to be very clear.
Right. Or at least had been accused,

1100
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,210
so where it goes and Farley
Lik let that play out,

1101
01:04:27,211 --> 01:04:30,990
but that is a very different thing.
Then all of the,

1102
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:34,740
the like the hatred and the
fucking going after people.

1103
01:04:34,741 --> 01:04:39,240
It's like you have to figure out where,
where the line gets drawn,

1104
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:42,730
where you're causing internal conflict
that can literally lead to civil war. But,

1105
01:04:42,731 --> 01:04:43,860
but it's trickled down to,

1106
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:48,870
into our economy of everyone's lives now
like on Twitter or in entertainment or

1107
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:52,860
with the me too movement. Like it's
trickled down. It's a trickle down effect.

1108
01:04:52,861 --> 01:04:53,191
Well,
you know,

1109
01:04:53,191 --> 01:04:58,191
George Washington said one of the most
important qualities for a society to have

1110
01:04:58,441 --> 01:05:00,900
a civility and what does stability mean?

1111
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:03,450
The founding fathers did not
agree on a lot of stuff. I mean,

1112
01:05:03,451 --> 01:05:05,910
Madison didn't agree
with, with uh, you know,

1113
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:08,790
Hamilton and Jefferson,

1114
01:05:08,791 --> 01:05:12,510
they were very much at odds about
how to go forward with this republic.

1115
01:05:12,511 --> 01:05:15,780
But they talked it out.
They compromised nobody,

1116
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:18,130
nobody got violent besides
Aaron burr and fucking

1117
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,730
Hamilton later. But for the
most part, they compromised.

1118
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,640
They talked and George Washington said,
civility,

1119
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:26,500
the ability to listen to the other side.

1120
01:05:26,501 --> 01:05:30,490
We even when you don't agree with
them and put your ideas together,

1121
01:05:30,491 --> 01:05:33,370
that's how you move things forward.
We just don't have that anymore.

1122
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:34,460
You just don't have it.
Right.

1123
01:05:34,461 --> 01:05:37,390
I think that's a really good point and
that's what bothers me the most about

1124
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:40,630
this is not, not that they're not
corrected, there's some real problems.

1125
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,720
It's the way everybody's going about it.
That makes me say like,

1126
01:05:43,721 --> 01:05:46,000
do you understand what happens
when you yell at people?

1127
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:48,040
Like you can't just push people.
There's,

1128
01:05:48,041 --> 01:05:51,010
there's people that don't
understand violent consequences.

1129
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:53,920
There's people that don't understand
conflict and they don't know how to

1130
01:05:53,921 --> 01:05:57,190
mitigate it and they don't know how to
like be calm and how to figure their way

1131
01:05:57,191 --> 01:05:58,060
through a situation.

1132
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:03,390
There's dangerous levels of aggression
that get reached when you have like

1133
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:08,560
Antifa feuding with these people that
are trying to do some sort of a speech

1134
01:06:08,561 --> 01:06:12,070
somewhere and there's the supporters of
the speech and then there's Antifa and

1135
01:06:12,071 --> 01:06:15,280
everyone's getting to get in screaming
and there's fire and bike locks and

1136
01:06:15,281 --> 01:06:18,460
people beating the shit out of each
other. All this stuff. There's,

1137
01:06:18,461 --> 01:06:22,300
there's plenty of videos to
this happening. This, this
doesn't have to end here.

1138
01:06:22,301 --> 01:06:25,840
Okay. This wasn't here five
years ago. Understand this,

1139
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:30,010
that this could escalate in five years
to be significantly worse than it is now.

1140
01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:34,870
And me as a person who I, I'm,
I don't want violence around me,

1141
01:06:34,930 --> 01:06:38,620
I see that shit come in and I
go, oh, these guys are fighting.

1142
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:39,990
Let's get the fuck out.

1143
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:43,570
You don't want to go get close to them
and hope you catch a stray bullet.

1144
01:06:43,571 --> 01:06:46,690
And now the problem is that that five,
10 years,

1145
01:06:46,691 --> 01:06:50,890
like the problem is that conflict
comes to you. I mean, the problem is

1146
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:57,010
it's unnecessary. It's not how we should
communicate with each other, you know?

1147
01:06:57,011 --> 01:07:00,100
And I think there's also people that
are emboldened by movements, right?

1148
01:07:00,101 --> 01:07:00,460
They get a,

1149
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:03,760
they become a part of a movement and then
they want to do something to commit to

1150
01:07:03,761 --> 01:07:06,910
that movement. It's very similar
to joining a fucking militia.

1151
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:09,990
It's very similar to joining resistance.
Media makes it easier.

1152
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,060
Social media has made it
easier to find your tribe,

1153
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:16,950
surround yourself with people who see the
world exactly like you do and organize

1154
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:21,250
and attack the other shot with social
media. That's what makes isis kind of so,

1155
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:24,340
so violent and also so scary
is because social media,

1156
01:07:24,341 --> 01:07:28,230
the first one's Kinda mastered
social media. My, my bigger worries.

1157
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:33,240
Also the fact that people can't even
agree on the validity of their sources.

1158
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,410
So if I say, well, you know, uh,

1159
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:40,480
according to the United Nations or
the Bureau of Labor and Statistics,

1160
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:42,160
and you go,
that's bullshit.

1161
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:45,480
It's now I can't even get off the ground
because there's too much info. Right? So,

1162
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:49,180
so I'm, I'm going through, I'm, if
I go to mainstream sources, you go,

1163
01:07:49,181 --> 01:07:51,670
that's mainstream and that's bullshit.
And they're bought off by corporations.

1164
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,830
They have an agenda, came to
have an argument about, well,

1165
01:07:53,831 --> 01:07:55,670
here's something that I'm
trying to get better at it.

1166
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:57,280
And I've worked on it a lot.

1167
01:07:57,580 --> 01:08:02,580
I try really hard to not be
connected to whatever I believe in.

1168
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:06,940
And I try to not try
to win a conversation.

1169
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:10,740
Those are two very important things.
So we hope to find it. Yes. But I'm,

1170
01:08:10,741 --> 01:08:14,260
I'm trying harder than I've ever tried
in my life and I've been on a path trying

1171
01:08:14,261 --> 01:08:16,100
to do this for years now and

1172
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:19,690
getting better at it because of
just listening to podcasts, listen,

1173
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:23,720
and having podcast and having conflicts
with people and trying to figure out why

1174
01:08:23,721 --> 01:08:25,640
I had those conflicts and
how much of it was my fault.

1175
01:08:25,730 --> 01:08:27,200
How much of it could have prevented,

1176
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:30,230
how much have I could've done a better
job as a host or as a person who is

1177
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:34,910
trying to relay the information and
through time I have tried my hardest and

1178
01:08:34,911 --> 01:08:38,090
it's something that concentrate on all
the time to not be connected to my ideas,

1179
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:39,980
to argue them if I feel
like there's merit,

1180
01:08:39,981 --> 01:08:44,170
but argue the merit and not argue my
connection or emotional connection,

1181
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:47,090
emotional connection to that claim.
So when someone does that, I get,

1182
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:50,030
I get exhausted now because I
know where it's gone. I'm like,

1183
01:08:50,031 --> 01:08:53,090
we're going to waste a lot of time with
this because you're not willing to even

1184
01:08:53,091 --> 01:08:57,470
think about the possibility. I said the
last podcast it with Jordan Peterson.

1185
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:00,050
I said, do you feel like
you're winning this debate?

1186
01:09:00,051 --> 01:09:02,330
Because at this point he'd
become so famous, and he said,

1187
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:06,500
I don't want to win this because
I'm going to create resentful.

1188
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:11,060
People feel like resentful losers.
That's not, that's not the point.

1189
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:16,240
The point is to figure out
a way to present ideas so
that they are accessible to

1190
01:09:16,521 --> 01:09:18,920
the people whose minds
I'm trying to change.

1191
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:21,110
This is exactly what he said
about Trump supporters. He said,

1192
01:09:21,111 --> 01:09:23,630
if you disagree with Trump supporters,
don't insult them.

1193
01:09:23,631 --> 01:09:25,880
That make them feel like
they're losers. Exactly. No,

1194
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:30,380
that doesn't make anybody
feel good and you also said,

1195
01:09:30,381 --> 01:09:33,020
how do you think they're going to react
to that if you think they're just going

1196
01:09:33,021 --> 01:09:35,470
to give into you,
and he's a clinical site psychologist,

1197
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:38,210
so we understand how he
understands how human brains work.

1198
01:09:38,690 --> 01:09:41,210
We do that immediately. What do we say
about Trump supporters? A lot of people,

1199
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:45,620
this I really, they go, they're racists.
They're, they're, they're sexist,

1200
01:09:45,621 --> 01:09:48,290
transphobic, they're there most
all the haters and all this stuff.

1201
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:52,760
Whereas maybe the LEP presented an
alternative that was unacceptable to them.

1202
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:56,120
They didn't like this con man or this
guy was needless, but they were like,

1203
01:09:56,121 --> 01:10:00,320
let's give it a shot. I have 300 bucks
in the bank. I got no other options.

1204
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:03,140
There's also that give people
the benefit of the doubt.

1205
01:10:03,141 --> 01:10:06,200
Most people are not assholes questionably.
There's,

1206
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:09,100
there's both of those things and
there's some people that are out. Sure.

1207
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:12,080
That's part of the problem is
that you run into enough of those,

1208
01:10:12,081 --> 01:10:13,790
those hurt your feelings and you think,
oh,

1209
01:10:13,791 --> 01:10:16,550
all Trump supporters are assholes because
I already know already though. Right,

1210
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:18,640
but that's negative lens.

1211
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:23,150
I feel like it's all negativity bias
is also something where our brains we

1212
01:10:23,151 --> 01:10:27,170
gravitate towards. If I get caught,
yeah, I'm not going to see my Instagram.

1213
01:10:27,171 --> 01:10:31,160
If you have a thousand comments
and 900 of her positive,

1214
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:33,180
you'll see the one that you would know.

1215
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:36,560
If you have 900 and you have
a hundred that are negative,

1216
01:10:36,561 --> 01:10:39,710
you're fucked and Super Fun. You're going
to read a hundred negative comments.

1217
01:10:39,711 --> 01:10:42,550
I'll say like you'll have a
million right along the competence,

1218
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:46,220
but think about how amazing that
is that you have 90% positive.

1219
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:50,060
In this crazy world. Oh, I know. So
things. All right, so if you have,

1220
01:10:50,061 --> 01:10:53,170
but your mind looks like, you know, your
mind goes towards the name of it. Yeah,

1221
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:55,730
but what I'm saying is that the numbers,
as they expand,

1222
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,460
they get more and more ridiculous.
So if you have a podcast,

1223
01:10:58,461 --> 01:11:03,350
the podcast gets a million downloads and
you get 100,000 negative comments and

1224
01:11:03,351 --> 01:11:07,310
900,000 positive. I was like, Oh,
have you looked at this as exhausting?

1225
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:12,170
Have you looked at how, how many people
alcohol kills versus guns for example?

1226
01:11:12,230 --> 01:11:13,170
Oh,
you know what I'm saying?

1227
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,110
But nobody is talking
about banning alcohol.

1228
01:11:16,111 --> 01:11:18,540
You could really go into all
these details right there

1229
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:24,010
because of obesity shortened lives because
of poor diet shows way more appealing

1230
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:26,610
terrorism.
It kills a lot of fucking people.

1231
01:11:26,611 --> 01:11:28,350
And then there's also shit that happens.

1232
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:32,040
Like we were talking about this recently
about Chicago, the violence in Chicago,

1233
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:36,300
the numbers are so crazy and
no one seems to be flinching.

1234
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:41,490
Like if those numbers were in
Beverly Hills, it's Beverly hills,

1235
01:11:41,491 --> 01:11:42,700
not the south side of Chicago.

1236
01:11:42,701 --> 01:11:46,710
If Beverly Hills had a thousand people
kill their shot in a year, we'd be like,

1237
01:11:46,711 --> 01:11:49,660
what in the fuck are you talking to?
Was Can we accept? We're like, God,

1238
01:11:49,661 --> 01:11:52,590
that's Chicago.
It's fucking crazy because the custom too.

1239
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:58,160
It's like if a girl of chooses Charlie
Sheen of like spitting on her and doing

1240
01:11:58,171 --> 01:12:02,430
coke off her asshole you
like, yeah, that's what he
does. Of course what he does.

1241
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:06,560
So if you hear others violence in
Chicago like Yup, that's what they do.

1242
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:09,630
Hearing about that west side,
south side, we just like,

1243
01:12:09,631 --> 01:12:14,010
we liked the map to be discernible. Okay,
I know what this is. I know what that is.

1244
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:17,190
Right. Keep it stat. Especially like
though, if it's something horrific,

1245
01:12:17,191 --> 01:12:19,190
like there's a Syrah serial killer,

1246
01:12:19,191 --> 01:12:23,340
so freaking the fuck everybody's out
knocking on doors. That's scary shit.

1247
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:25,890
Chances of a Syracuse.

1248
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:29,760
But there are also things that scare the
fuck out of you and that's where like,

1249
01:12:29,761 --> 01:12:30,720
I will not,

1250
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:35,490
I will not go into the ocean and
swim where I can't touch the ground,

1251
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:40,200
just done and it's stupid. It's
ridiculous. Smart move. Fuck. That place,

1252
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:44,520
especially the Pacific was great ways.
Salah boot overrun,

1253
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:48,620
overrun with great whites. San Francisco
is a fucking breeding ground, right?

1254
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:52,350
That's going to San Francisco.
This guy, this guy, this
guy in Marina del Ray, he's,

1255
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:57,300
he's swimming and he's got his hands
like tuck that aside like a seal and he's

1256
01:12:57,301 --> 01:13:01,830
going like this. He's diving in and I'm
like, Bro, you, you are stealing out.

1257
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:05,070
You look like a giant smooth,
delicious seal right now.

1258
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:08,550
Is that what you're saying? Let me, if
there's, if there's one bad ass way to go,

1259
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:11,310
that's pretty sick and they
can see an end for sure.

1260
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:16,380
Brazil got his dick bitten off. No.
Yup. Right through the crotch. Right?

1261
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:20,880
The crotch. The Dick, the balls.
Asshole died. Bled out on the beach.

1262
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:25,650
They bled out after the shark pit as Dick.
I'll take the, I'll take that cod. Hey,

1263
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:27,720
meet me in half.
I got a peek.

1264
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:32,460
I did a podcast where you got to watch
Jeff Garlin so sorry. I'm so sorry Kim.

1265
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:37,010
The flattering when it comes back, we're
going to talk about actual fights over

1266
01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:41,700
hopefully hold holding please.
You get P two, but I'm like,

1267
01:13:41,701 --> 01:13:43,640
I can leave you by yourself.
I'll go after it.

1268
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:49,290
I'll just talk about the constitution
guys. Fucking half a minute of your time.

1269
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:53,330
You know the history of the Ottoman
Empire is very interesting. Actually.

1270
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:54,600
We have to go all the way back though.

1271
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:57,510
Can you imagine me just
fucking reading out of a book?

1272
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:00,840
Why don't you plug your dates?

1273
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,750
Plugging my days is anything
where it's when someone does that,

1274
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:06,810
now that Joe's gone,
Hey Austin,

1275
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,180
first week of August you will be there.
Right.

1276
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:16,120
Um, now that you're taking
a break from the road, you
should come. I mean, surprise.

1277
01:14:16,121 --> 01:14:19,570
Some people maybe pick a city.
I do that come out and just open for you.

1278
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,010
What about Vancouver?
One night,

1279
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:25,190
September 13th if I'm
not shooting my Thursday,

1280
01:14:25,191 --> 01:14:29,260
my two TV shows and I thought you were
shooting in October. I'm so talented.

1281
01:14:29,261 --> 01:14:32,710
I forget. I'm shooting. I'm shooting
some of the Goldbergs I think August,

1282
01:14:32,711 --> 01:14:35,560
September, the last season
of goal bridge. I believe so.

1283
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:37,990
And then I go and then I
think we started shooting.

1284
01:14:37,991 --> 01:14:42,640
I shoot one episode of schools and August
than the rest of October. Why? Just one?

1285
01:14:42,641 --> 01:14:44,670
It's just like a pilot. I
don't know. Yeah, no isn't, no,

1286
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:49,210
just the way they do the schedule.
They want to figure it out. Yeah. Yeah.

1287
01:14:49,211 --> 01:14:49,961
Writing and stuff.

1288
01:14:49,961 --> 01:14:53,620
Writing and then when do you think you'd
go back on the road for stand up? Up,

1289
01:14:53,621 --> 01:14:56,820
get restless. I know it will happen
right now. I haven't thought about it.

1290
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:59,500
That's the thing like I'll
like I'll go on whatever.

1291
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:03,730
I'll be gone for every weekend of the
month and I'm like I need a break and then

1292
01:15:03,731 --> 01:15:07,880
I get one weekend off and like they
get back on the road. I knew miss it.

1293
01:15:07,881 --> 01:15:10,690
It's beautimous it. There's
nothing like it sometimes. Yeah,

1294
01:15:10,770 --> 01:15:13,750
sometimes it's beautiful.
Yeah. Sometimes it can be.

1295
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:17,230
You can be in a city and it's terrible
but I just sometimes can be a little

1296
01:15:17,231 --> 01:15:19,510
rough. Yeah. I was
talking to Kelly because,

1297
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:22,450
well you're going to be doing the same
thing cause count shot especially rights

1298
01:15:22,451 --> 01:15:23,650
and I didn't take a break from the road.

1299
01:15:23,651 --> 01:15:27,340
You shooting the show and I was saying
there's sometimes like a month ago in

1300
01:15:27,341 --> 01:15:31,600
this month coming up, I'm
on the road every weekend.
That's rough. It's rough. But,

1301
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:32,920
and then I'm like, God, I need a break.

1302
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:35,140
And then I get a break and have
like a week or two off. I'm like,

1303
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:37,540
I need to get back on the road.
Like it's weird. You Miss,

1304
01:15:37,541 --> 01:15:41,470
this is my first break and 12
here, two weeks. But when you were,

1305
01:15:41,471 --> 01:15:46,050
let's say at my level in comedy,
you were grinding grindstone. Yeah.

1306
01:15:46,450 --> 01:15:49,540
You gotta, you gotta do what you gotta
do in the moment. You know when you're,

1307
01:15:49,541 --> 01:15:52,650
you're in that stage where you're
just trying to get those reps in too.

1308
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:55,330
But I'm just saying like that you
missed the like, I'm like, God,

1309
01:15:55,331 --> 01:15:58,000
I need a fucking break this road,
man. Hotels and restaurants,

1310
01:15:58,001 --> 01:16:00,580
I need a fucking break. And I get back.
I'm like, I need to get back home.

1311
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:03,670
It's weird. Love, hate
relationship. For 12 years.

1312
01:16:03,671 --> 01:16:05,860
It's the first time I've had a break
and I hadn't thought about it at all,

1313
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:08,860
but it'll hit me and I'll start
to freak gay. He gets tired.

1314
01:16:08,890 --> 01:16:12,790
You get tired of waking up in hotel
rooms. Tired of flying. It's lonely. Sad.

1315
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:17,260
I hate being out of my
routine. Yeah. That's what I
hate most. Your home routine.

1316
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:20,980
Hate it. Yeah. I don't like that
either. But there's no alternative.

1317
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:23,840
If you want to do big shows and you
want to go on the road. Do you want all,

1318
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:25,490
I'm never stopped. Yeah. Not also.

1319
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:28,360
I don't think there's an alternative
in terms of like creating material.

1320
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:31,900
I think you need a bunch of different
kinds. You need Philly, you need Boston,

1321
01:16:32,030 --> 01:16:35,710
you need Florida. He need Miami too.
Occasionally you need to be like, oh,

1322
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:37,120
there's some people that
just don't pay attention.

1323
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:40,960
And the time alone sometimes
like just your, you know,

1324
01:16:40,961 --> 01:16:42,190
you gotta you gotta fill that day.

1325
01:16:42,191 --> 01:16:45,370
But I fucking love it cause I'm
just thinking and stuff. Dude.

1326
01:16:45,371 --> 01:16:47,700
You're a Bullock fucking calf muscle.

1327
01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:51,730
Most annoying muscle to pull cause it
doesn't heal because you're always on.

1328
01:16:51,731 --> 01:16:56,620
It takes awhile. Yeah. Oh such do you
do that fucking cunt elephants? No, no.

1329
01:16:56,740 --> 01:17:01,110
About two months ago I heard it and it's
never gotten back from running. Yup.

1330
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:05,010
Oh yeah, now I to piss out, I'm still
run. I'll be right back. It's weird.

1331
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:09,590
Can still run. Yeah. I could still
run. Um, but it's just, I feel it.

1332
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:14,120
I could see that and I wonder what
the science is behind it that,

1333
01:17:14,170 --> 01:17:16,070
that I have a recurring injury,
right.

1334
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:20,000
So I'll pull my lower back and my right
side or I'll pull my neck as a neck

1335
01:17:20,001 --> 01:17:23,180
muscle from wrestling probably
from years ago where I at.

1336
01:17:23,181 --> 01:17:25,550
Sometimes if sometimes I'll do something,

1337
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:28,880
whether it's played tennis or box or
whatever, I'm fucking around and I'm,

1338
01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:31,760
I'm like, Oh fuck, I'm done for,
it's always the same side. Yeah.

1339
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:36,710
I'm done for a week. Yeah. I bet a scar
tissue thing a bit. It's a mobility thing.

1340
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,720
I bet that's one of the things and a bit,

1341
01:17:38,721 --> 01:17:42,620
you probably at some point in time had
a bulging disc and it's probably still a

1342
01:17:42,621 --> 01:17:45,620
little fucked up and you never got an
Mri and then, so you don't really know.

1343
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:47,780
Right. That's interesting.
And I think, um,

1344
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:51,530
that's one of the areas that a lot of
people don't strengthen is their spine.

1345
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:55,420
You know,
I've spent a lot of time over the last uh,

1346
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:59,720
few years using a bunch
of different exercises and
machines just specifically to

1347
01:17:59,721 --> 01:18:03,820
strengthen my spine and my core
after having some bulging back,

1348
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:04,760
she was doing that.

1349
01:18:04,761 --> 01:18:08,750
I cured my lower back because of Lauren
Landau and my Buddy Leo, who helped me,

1350
01:18:08,751 --> 01:18:11,300
uh, kind of, uh, cause my
lower back hard for 20 years.

1351
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:15,860
And they give me just some exercise
that I do every day and they're mostly

1352
01:18:15,870 --> 01:18:19,700
strengthening next time
they're not stretching the
strengthening your glutes and

1353
01:18:19,701 --> 01:18:23,060
stuff. I got no problems with my lower
back. I mean I cured my lower back,

1354
01:18:23,061 --> 01:18:26,300
which is kind of a miracle to consider
the idea that later on in my life.

1355
01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:28,240
But my neck is, uh, you know, and I do it.

1356
01:18:28,241 --> 01:18:31,700
I do neck exercises now you've got to
try this iron neck thing that I have out

1357
01:18:31,701 --> 01:18:35,380
here. I will, it's the fucking best.
Really? Yeah. He put a halo on your head,

1358
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:37,220
you screw it on,
pull it on,

1359
01:18:37,221 --> 01:18:40,760
and then you pump itched like a Reebok
pump and I like fits tight to your head

1360
01:18:40,910 --> 01:18:43,700
and then you've got a bungee cord that's
attached to it that's 50 pounds and

1361
01:18:43,701 --> 01:18:47,990
you're back up with this thing and
then you do rotations like wow, really,

1362
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:49,400
really good,
phenomenal.

1363
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:53,210
But the most important thing is that
it's not dangerous and it's strengthening

1364
01:18:53,211 --> 01:18:57,500
your neck in the in a way where you're
giving it a full range of motion.

1365
01:18:57,620 --> 01:19:00,290
I want to do, I want to bottle and look
next. Don't get worked out that much.

1366
01:19:00,291 --> 01:19:01,550
Your lower back doesn't get worked out.

1367
01:19:01,551 --> 01:19:04,460
Then now she got to think like all the
other things are getting all these loads.

1368
01:19:04,461 --> 01:19:08,240
So when when you put a load on the
lower back and it's not strong enough,

1369
01:19:08,241 --> 01:19:10,940
that's when things go go out.
Yeah. If you strengthen it,

1370
01:19:10,941 --> 01:19:13,070
you can prevent a lot of that
stuff from happening. Right?

1371
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:16,580
Like yoga is great for that. Yoga is
great for the back, great for the spine.

1372
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:19,730
It's like one of those things you
realize when you're doing it like, oh,

1373
01:19:19,731 --> 01:19:22,700
these are muscles that I hardly ever
wear. Like what you do? Triangle pose.

1374
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:26,270
Hardly ever worked that out yourself.
My jeans like to splash, bro.

1375
01:19:26,330 --> 01:19:30,700
Don't worry about it prompted my just
piss. It's a cute outfit on PP. Babies.

1376
01:19:30,710 --> 01:19:35,180
Kind of very colorful outfit. Yeah. You're
very hippy today. Twin bed. I left wing.

1377
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:39,390
It's back. It's back. It's back. I
didn't know. I'm sure you get some title.

1378
01:19:39,391 --> 01:19:41,800
I should. No, I do have a tie back.

1379
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:47,200
Got Sean O'Malley shirt
that I've worn that one

1380
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:50,760
sugar straight on in the
house, baby. Oh Dude.

1381
01:19:50,770 --> 01:19:55,190
How about a fricking nick do a loss to
get them to the contenders. Read that.

1382
01:19:55,191 --> 01:19:59,310
I did not have a chance to watch the
fight. I don't want you can initiate it,

1383
01:19:59,330 --> 01:20:03,290
but I saw that, which is a bummer. I'm
rooting for like, I hope they win too.

1384
01:20:03,291 --> 01:20:05,840
It's interesting in chat was
the big story was that he lost,

1385
01:20:05,841 --> 01:20:08,010
not that the other guy won.
Like I kept reading that

1386
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:10,020
he lost.
I didn't read that the other guy won.

1387
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:12,510
I don't even know who the other guy is.
Me Neither. But I heard he's a bad ass,

1388
01:20:12,511 --> 01:20:15,090
but it's like, all right. You know
how crazy is that? Who Busy? Crazy.

1389
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:20,150
Let's like you beat the guy with one
arm, but let's give the guys name. Maya.

1390
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:25,080
My font was like how much bigger can you
be with the rest of your body if you're

1391
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:28,150
like, how much? How many pounds was
the arm? It's just his forearm, right?

1392
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:32,550
What'd you say, Jamie? Alex Munoz. Alex,
when Yo shout out to Alex Razor Blade man,

1393
01:20:32,551 --> 01:20:37,320
I heard it was a tough fight but nick
knew was a bad ass. You in the UFC? I, I,

1394
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:40,770
I don't think the contender says is
right for them. Well, here's the thing.

1395
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:43,280
A lot of the guys that are in the
contenders here is contender. Was,

1396
01:20:43,281 --> 01:20:46,110
is fucking excellent and a lot of guys
that are in that series is going to wind

1397
01:20:46,111 --> 01:20:48,240
up in the UFC anyway.
If you lose to one of them,

1398
01:20:48,241 --> 01:20:50,160
it doesn't mean that you're not good.
It means there's a luck.

1399
01:20:50,450 --> 01:20:52,530
The talent level's very high right now.

1400
01:20:52,710 --> 01:20:56,250
I would say up and coming back and
tennis shoes better and tough way,

1401
01:20:56,251 --> 01:20:58,980
but entertainment wise, and I am
close contender, she just kills it.

1402
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:02,100
It's way better. Talent wise
does got tired. Oh tough.

1403
01:21:02,101 --> 01:21:07,010
Got Tired of this style or style of
coaching sauce. All the reality parts.

1404
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:07,741
They're doing it again,

1405
01:21:07,741 --> 01:21:11,240
but I think they have to contractually
with Kelvin and Whitaker, right? Yeah.

1406
01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:14,560
I mean it's still, the fights are worth
watching. It's still worth it thought.

1407
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:18,510
Some people like that reality TV
people still watch big brother Bro.

1408
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,300
They love it. I see people tweeting
about big brother. I'm like,

1409
01:21:21,301 --> 01:21:24,060
what are you doing?
The ratings,

1410
01:21:24,061 --> 01:21:27,810
I mean the very few people are watching
tough these days. The Reagans are so bad.

1411
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:31,770
What are the ratings that there's seven
people that watch this happen Bro.

1412
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:37,460
And they also buy family everywhere
in hospitals. They to what?

1413
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:40,270
No, I just think you know with,
with the contenders sees it,

1414
01:21:40,271 --> 01:21:43,650
it's Austin and making this push like
that's where you're getting your new young

1415
01:21:43,651 --> 01:21:46,260
talent. Yeah. I think that's,
that's what I want to say.

1416
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:47,700
I don't want to see all the reality.

1417
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:53,690
You know what the thing is that people
that like reality shows like it because

1418
01:21:53,821 --> 01:21:55,570
it allows you to have the reality shows.

1419
01:21:56,680 --> 01:22:01,140
Well cause the condensers is kicking
ass. Tough is not. That's fine.

1420
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:03,060
I'm just saying Bro.
Yeah, that's a good point.

1421
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:06,600
I think that to some people that don't
even know what's on the air anymore.

1422
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:10,770
When the fuck do you hear
about an ad for that show?

1423
01:22:11,050 --> 01:22:14,280
The even the UFC is like work hood.
We're not putting any marketing in that.

1424
01:22:14,281 --> 01:22:18,210
We owe this last season. Just put two
fucking guys who will agree to do it.

1425
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:22,320
Then how many but how much promotion you
see for Dana White's contender series?

1426
01:22:22,321 --> 01:22:26,010
Yeah, that's all over. Ratings are
way better. That's way better. Yeah.

1427
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:29,370
Let's just say it's what
people want to see his fights.

1428
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,640
They're going through a divorce
with Fox and then I can, all right,

1429
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:34,860
well we're just going to live here til
December then we'll take our stuff,

1430
01:22:34,861 --> 01:22:37,990
get the fuck out. We're here. Right? You
can keep the dogs and then when you know,

1431
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,870
we'll figure it out. It's so weird.
And even fox like posting stuff,

1432
01:22:42,871 --> 01:22:45,720
the WWE,
cause they're coming over to,

1433
01:22:46,130 --> 01:22:49,990
so they're flexing when they're new
side piece. It's so funny. It's,

1434
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:55,040
but it's how many carry over audience
members are there from a UFC to WWE cross?

1435
01:22:56,821 --> 01:22:59,250
I don't. Yeah, I dunno. Fox
and give a fuck. Cause they,

1436
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:01,530
what they know for sure as
you can control the narrative.

1437
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:05,140
Wwe on those Friday night or Wednesday
night smack downs where the fuck they

1438
01:23:05,141 --> 01:23:10,141
call it bring in 3 million viewers every
single night and it's going to be chaos

1439
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:13,000
and, but the end, they
can control the ratings.

1440
01:23:13,001 --> 01:23:15,460
They can control the superstars
and control everyone's destiny.

1441
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:20,160
They know that fan base brings that no
matter what, UFC is not that. Right. Yeah.

1442
01:23:20,290 --> 01:23:23,440
So if you're fox is kind of
smart. Yeah, it is smart.

1443
01:23:23,690 --> 01:23:27,190
It works for both parties.
Fox in his just you're going to see money.

1444
01:23:27,191 --> 01:23:30,680
It's the way to go. Yeah. If you're
Fox, that's what we care about. Race,

1445
01:23:30,690 --> 01:23:33,950
the it go to just trying to make money.
I think the,

1446
01:23:33,951 --> 01:23:38,410
the thing about the contender series
though is that it's a bypass thing, right?

1447
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:42,490
So it's all just good for the
UFC. Like what they own it. Yeah.

1448
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:45,940
But also how many people are seeing that?
I don't know how many people watch it.

1449
01:23:45,970 --> 01:23:50,970
I think a five is 200 to
300,000 subscribers and
Tuesday night contender series

1450
01:23:51,581 --> 01:23:55,420
is only on fight pass and correct.
Do they release it ever on Youtube?

1451
01:23:55,770 --> 01:24:00,340
Why not be a bad idea? I lights. They
blast out and stuff. I don't know. But um,

1452
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:03,090
yeah, I don't know. Yeah, it's, that's up.

1453
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:07,330
That whole world of up and coming
talent has gotten so different.

1454
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,300
The levels gotten significantly higher.

1455
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:13,710
I see guys coming into the UFC for the
first time and I'm watching him fight.

1456
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:17,770
I'm like, wow, this guy's
fighting. Like he's been here
for five years. I see, I see.

1457
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:21,130
Yes and no. Some of it I looked at
your holy, how many fights do you have?

1458
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:23,530
And they're like, just eight.
And he's that good. Jesus.

1459
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:27,460
And then sometimes like you looked at this
Germany card which lasted seven hours,

1460
01:24:27,461 --> 01:24:29,770
which is a whole nother
topic we should discuss.

1461
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:35,040
But when you in the eye look at some
and the difference between like say a

1462
01:24:35,231 --> 01:24:38,190
Robert Whitaker verse,
you all Ramiro versus you know,

1463
01:24:38,230 --> 01:24:41,560
some different cards where it's an
opening main card fight. The the,

1464
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:45,850
the talent pool sometimes is so different.
Well that's just could be cards.

1465
01:24:45,870 --> 01:24:46,110
You know,

1466
01:24:46,110 --> 01:24:49,210
sometimes you get a card in the talent
pool and that card it's just not the

1467
01:24:49,211 --> 01:24:50,044
highest level.

1468
01:24:50,170 --> 01:24:53,680
And then you get other cards where like
you don't even know who the fighters are

1469
01:24:53,710 --> 01:24:55,440
and the talent's really hot,
insanely high.

1470
01:24:55,441 --> 01:24:59,110
My point is when you watch other
main professional sports, you don't,

1471
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:02,900
you don't get that. No, no. I'm saying no.
But you also taught get your get volume.

1472
01:25:03,190 --> 01:25:07,810
Think about the volume of boxing
matches versus the volume of UFC cards.

1473
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:12,160
It's not even close. The number of fights
that people are paying attention to.

1474
01:25:12,161 --> 01:25:17,140
Every card has 11 to 13 fights
and I think that's our problem.

1475
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:21,100
Well the problem is it's a popular, it's
popular with people that want to do it,

1476
01:25:21,101 --> 01:25:23,290
these young bad asses that
want to prove they're the best.

1477
01:25:23,291 --> 01:25:27,710
There's a lot of them say it's spot, but
as far as contestants, people signing up,

1478
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:32,080
signing up for is what's not poplars
people tuning into all these fights. No.

1479
01:25:32,230 --> 01:25:36,520
Now you asked the issue, you have to
make it special. Right? But do you,

1480
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,810
because here's the thing.

1481
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:40,720
Even if you just have a small number
that are tuning in every week,

1482
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:44,390
say if you have fights every week
and 300,000 people watch like, oh,

1483
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:45,580
this is a commercial disaster,

1484
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:50,880
you still are building 300,000 people
and it's gonna be a different 300,000

1485
01:25:51,011 --> 01:25:54,040
people quite possibly next weekly. Some
of them are, at least some of them are.

1486
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:56,110
You're going to have different narratives.

1487
01:25:56,111 --> 01:25:58,630
You got to have different fighters you
shine and then they're going to go off

1488
01:25:58,631 --> 01:26:02,080
into pay per view events. They're
going to go off into big ESPN events.

1489
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,550
They're going to become household names
and that's where the is going to be made.

1490
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:08,480
And so the, our argument is
the more she fights you have,

1491
01:26:08,481 --> 01:26:10,370
even if some of fights
that aren't doing well,

1492
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:13,970
you are still allowing a really
high level of competition.

1493
01:26:13,971 --> 01:26:18,971
These fucking assassins merged through
the top these Darren tills and these Yoel

1494
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:24,860
Romero's and all these fucking killers
come to these Bora cina fucking eraser

1495
01:26:24,890 --> 01:26:26,270
versus Yoel Romero.

1496
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:31,250
Oh my stuff versus team.

1497
01:26:31,251 --> 01:26:35,950
All body first team, all body,
both guys crazy muscular it.

1498
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:40,720
I'm not mad at you, your whole
body. I mean extreme. But
Joseph, to your point too,

1499
01:26:40,721 --> 01:26:44,210
back to your point where your saturation
saturation in the market and you're

1500
01:26:44,211 --> 01:26:47,870
hoping that the superstars come out
of there that's not working. Well,

1501
01:26:47,871 --> 01:26:50,960
here's the thing. There's a cycle
and I think this is a cycle,

1502
01:26:50,961 --> 01:26:53,090
the same way as a cycle
of predators and prey.

1503
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:56,510
Do you know if they have
like snowshoe hares and lynx?

1504
01:26:56,660 --> 01:27:00,770
There's a cycle where the snowshoe hares
get to a very high number and the links

1505
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:04,430
eat them all and then the links get to
a very high number and they run out of

1506
01:27:04,431 --> 01:27:08,510
snowshoe hares and the lynx dropped down
again and the snowshoe hares come back

1507
01:27:08,511 --> 01:27:10,790
up.
This is the natural cycle.

1508
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:14,270
And you're saying the cycle is going
to be the suit like a Conor Mcgregor,

1509
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:17,210
Ronda Rousey Brooklyn's. There's always
something. There's always someone,

1510
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:20,690
there's always someone who rises to the
biggest draw right now in the UFC for

1511
01:27:20,691 --> 01:27:24,800
sure. [inaudible] second. Besides,
besides him, George Saint Pierre,

1512
01:27:24,801 --> 01:27:29,510
if he wants to fight George St Pierre,
especially just wimpy Connor Brock,

1513
01:27:29,540 --> 01:27:33,800
George, those are your three. Castro's
Brock would not be Conor at this stage.

1514
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:37,200
I'm saying one, two, three. Right.

1515
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:40,120
But if the UFC was around,

1516
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:42,830
I mean if we were at the
stage where Brock was like,

1517
01:27:42,831 --> 01:27:45,800
say before he beat Frank Mir,
like when,

1518
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:49,850
when when he was the heavyweight champion,
when Barack was just smashed it,

1519
01:27:49,851 --> 01:27:50,600
he was a,

1520
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:55,220
he could sell what was like the highest
pay per view with Brock and I think it

1521
01:27:55,221 --> 01:27:59,270
was like 2 million. The third highest
honor in Nate's first. Yeah. So it's,

1522
01:27:59,271 --> 01:28:03,470
it's in that light. UFC wasn't as
popular then, I don't think as it is now.

1523
01:28:03,530 --> 01:28:06,820
But they, they did the dub dub.
He had the Wib fanbase crossover.

1524
01:28:06,830 --> 01:28:09,080
But what's interesting to them,
a lot of people don't, you know,

1525
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:12,110
there's a reason why,
but the demand for Nate Diaz too,

1526
01:28:12,111 --> 01:28:15,650
cause remember he's part of the biggest
paper you all time with Connor Mcgregor.

1527
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:20,240
So ideas isn't that tier two.
You can go Connor Brock, Rhonda,

1528
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:23,540
Nate's four or five.
It's number two,

1529
01:28:23,990 --> 01:28:28,790
UFC 100 Brock Lesnar versus Frank Mir.
1,600,000 bucks.

1530
01:28:29,210 --> 01:28:32,930
That's a lot. It's only 50,000 different
than Nate Diaz versus Conor Mcgregor,

1531
01:28:32,931 --> 01:28:37,370
which is number one. That's pretty
crazy. Those numbers are crazy. So, um,

1532
01:28:37,371 --> 01:28:41,180
and then Conor Mcgregor, Nate Diaz,
Conor has one, two, three, four, five.

1533
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:44,810
Misha Tate is amazing at UFC 200.

1534
01:28:44,811 --> 01:28:47,560
So you had Brock Lesnar.

1535
01:28:48,850 --> 01:28:53,500
Brock has a Shitload, Brock as one,
two, three out of the top seven.

1536
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:56,990
And Ronda comes in at number eight.
They're in their own.

1537
01:28:57,020 --> 01:28:58,260
They're on their own stratosphere,
right?

1538
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:03,540
Like they don't toss them in there.
Nate's right there. Yes. Number one.

1539
01:29:03,541 --> 01:29:07,380
Number three, that Amanda Nunez, Ronda
Rousey got a million million one.

1540
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:11,790
Nate Diaz. That's arguably because he
was fighting Conor McGregor. Right? Well,

1541
01:29:11,791 --> 01:29:15,240
and that's why it hasn't taken
a fight because that's the, the,

1542
01:29:15,241 --> 01:29:19,950
that trilogy is the biggest one.
The biggest. That hasn't happened.

1543
01:29:20,070 --> 01:29:23,610
I mean, it is the biggest, it's the
biggest. If con, here's the thing,

1544
01:29:23,611 --> 01:29:27,720
if Connor comes back and decides
to fight Khabib, that's a fight.

1545
01:29:28,350 --> 01:29:30,390
It's going to be a gigantic,
enormous,

1546
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:33,840
biggest paper view of all time and
if they decided to do it in Russia,

1547
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:37,170
fucking insane. And I'll be
watching from here with you guys.

1548
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:40,210
We're doing a companion for us for sure.
Rochelle huck on the run,

1549
01:29:40,630 --> 01:29:42,690
so that'll be our biggest companion ever,

1550
01:29:42,691 --> 01:29:44,760
by the way is adas
pulled me aside like two,

1551
01:29:44,761 --> 01:29:46,980
we're going to do some big things in
Russia. I'd really like you to come like,

1552
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:49,770
because like fuck out outta here man.
I ain't go to Russia.

1553
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:53,070
Cut to me for around my face.

1554
01:29:54,210 --> 01:29:57,930
I love it in Russia. That's why.
Amazing. Yeah. The problem is that trip,

1555
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,820
that trip insights, it's a long term
past. Nobody here with you guys.

1556
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:05,090
I'd rather be here with you guys anyway.
It's more fun. Kind of fine. Could be.

1557
01:30:05,310 --> 01:30:08,430
I really like being there live. Don't
get me wrong. I love it. I love the job,

1558
01:30:08,431 --> 01:30:12,240
but I'm going to be honest. It's more fun
watching the fights with you guys. Yeah,

1559
01:30:12,330 --> 01:30:15,600
for sure. Of course. Just not even
close to French. They didn't even clap.

1560
01:30:15,630 --> 01:30:17,630
We can get wine. Yeah.
Having cheese and kidding.

1561
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,370
Pissing people off because you chew it
on the microphone. Yeah, that's true.

1562
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:24,410
It's the most fun until we get into the
illuminati stuff so I can keep any on

1563
01:30:24,411 --> 01:30:28,140
tape. Luminato sharp left. I even enjoy
that. I get to be on, I Miss Eddie,

1564
01:30:28,170 --> 01:30:31,050
but Eddie done. Now he doesn't
drink. He doesn't drink. No,

1565
01:30:31,051 --> 01:30:33,550
he doesn't drink anymore and
he's way more reasonable. Well,

1566
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,830
like with that kind of stuff. He's not
an evolution, but I mean other than that,

1567
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:39,630
I don't know if that's true. I haven't
really talked to him about that. I just,

1568
01:30:39,631 --> 01:30:42,240
I'm just reading his Instagram is to,
they announced the big flight.

1569
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:46,680
Mike Perry Serone. Ooh. My parents are
in Denver. That's crazy. That's a great,

1570
01:30:46,681 --> 01:30:51,300
that was good. Good fight. That's
crazy. Five fricking great. Yeah.

1571
01:30:51,301 --> 01:30:54,960
He's dangerous, man.
He hits fucking whore.

1572
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:57,920
Plus his last fight against Paul filled.
Are you mixed it up. You started,

1573
01:30:57,950 --> 01:31:01,260
you started fighting. Smart. Dealt with
a real camp and Jackson's it's damn good.

1574
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:05,370
Yeah. Is that Jackson, Jackson,
Jackson Jackson crime with the cowboy.

1575
01:31:05,490 --> 01:31:08,970
He said he was essentially running his
own camp training himself before Railey.

1576
01:31:08,971 --> 01:31:11,310
Yup. Yup. And when you're
watching him fight,

1577
01:31:11,311 --> 01:31:14,790
now you're seeing what's matter Woodley
Til. That's the other one I forgot.

1578
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:18,240
But you're seeing him now in his
last fight against Paul Felder,

1579
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:20,640
he looked more polished.

1580
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:24,200
He looked more professional and as
a pro look completely different.

1581
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:27,020
Still got all the Marauder.
He's still a fucking killer.

1582
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:29,220
Still super aggressive knockout artists.

1583
01:31:29,221 --> 01:31:33,810
Like when stores controlled more strategy
go up to 70 when it was just for that

1584
01:31:33,811 --> 01:31:36,000
fight. It was just, they gave him
an option. You can shorten it,

1585
01:31:36,030 --> 01:31:37,170
but he would have done so tough.

1586
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,510
We been way better in that fight if he
didn't break his arm in the first round

1587
01:31:40,010 --> 01:31:42,240
until I saw it, I was like,
dude, I don't like that.

1588
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:46,200
When it bounced off his head
when it bounced off Perry's
head, I was like, dude,

1589
01:31:46,201 --> 01:31:48,320
that might be a broken arm.
I thought cry.

1590
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:52,410
Cause there's a lot of people like Paige
van Sanchez had a second surgery on her

1591
01:31:52,411 --> 01:31:54,860
arm because of that. She had
a lot of shit, more surgeries.

1592
01:31:54,990 --> 01:31:58,490
This caught up a kid.

1593
01:32:00,110 --> 01:32:03,930
I was like this, I don't know if I should
do I do that. I don't know what to do.

1594
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:10,960
The bone is not, it's not
easy to hit something with
your, especially a forehead.

1595
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:14,710
Yeah. This park, this shit snaps man.

1596
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:16,240
You know this is,
I'm,

1597
01:32:16,241 --> 01:32:20,290
I'm really surprised we don't have more
guys getting their forearms broken in.

1598
01:32:20,291 --> 01:32:23,770
Blocked in blocking kids. Yeah, because
there's some guys that just fun.

1599
01:32:24,210 --> 01:32:28,720
That's right. To break your arm
a little bit. It fell or fell.

1600
01:32:28,721 --> 01:32:32,110
There is um, it's such a, I
think he's a high level striker.

1601
01:32:32,111 --> 01:32:36,100
He's really super high, so fucking good
man. But look, he is, he is a smaller guy.

1602
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:40,290
Mike Perry's Mike Perry is a way more
scary one strike artists even though it

1603
01:32:40,291 --> 01:32:41,920
felt really scary.
55.

1604
01:32:42,130 --> 01:32:44,760
You lose a little bit of that when you
go up against the bigger guys. You just,

1605
01:32:44,770 --> 01:32:49,300
you just going til stood his ground toe
to toe with that guy. Highly skilled.

1606
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:53,930
He's very smart.
We highly skilled like his arms,

1607
01:32:54,350 --> 01:32:56,920
that version of Perry Hill
and then we saw it. It's like,

1608
01:32:56,980 --> 01:32:58,790
oh fuck that verse before.

1609
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:02,710
It's one of his most technical opponents
like that pair of shows up against

1610
01:33:02,711 --> 01:33:07,060
cowboy. We get like, okay, here's the
fight with the allonge Oban fight.

1611
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:11,020
Alan Jobe band, who's was fought a
smart technical fight. Outpointed Perry,

1612
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:14,650
and the way y'all pointed Perry, y'all
pointed Perry. That was more obvious.

1613
01:33:15,010 --> 01:33:18,850
It was a different Perry hunting. Just,
yeah, just boring one dimensional.

1614
01:33:18,851 --> 01:33:20,830
He was trying to just
put those hands on it,

1615
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:23,290
but now you see a guy who
was trying to do that,

1616
01:33:23,291 --> 01:33:26,170
but with like some Winkeljohn
strategy coach and he's young.

1617
01:33:26,171 --> 01:33:29,930
He's only like 26 right? He's gonna
be a problem. We've a lot dangerous.

1618
01:33:30,430 --> 01:33:32,860
Super Crystal, Bro. I am

1619
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:39,520
stunned. I'm stunned EOC talking about
Colby just had to get a nose operation for

1620
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:40,363
sinuses,

1621
01:33:40,630 --> 01:33:43,870
but this the thing Colby goes and I
spoke to someone very close to Colby.

1622
01:33:44,050 --> 01:33:47,260
Colby goes, dude, I'm down for the
fight. I just went five rounds.

1623
01:33:47,410 --> 01:33:51,130
Willie's been up for, how long? Give
me, I can do it in October, November.

1624
01:33:51,310 --> 01:33:54,310
Just let me get ready. I just said, I'm
going to have science fair. And they went,

1625
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:57,570
nope. Stripping of the belt until you
want it until it's like, fuck yeah,

1626
01:33:57,580 --> 01:33:59,020
I'll take it.
See that.

1627
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:04,080
That seems to be a problem for anybody
that's considering taking interim title

1628
01:34:05,141 --> 01:34:07,510
fight in the future.
That's what Ryan Ortega,

1629
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:10,510
Brian Ortega saw that and he was like,
listen,

1630
01:34:11,170 --> 01:34:15,350
they're offering him before that when
his flight got canceled because Max

1631
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:16,810
Holloway, it was running to
all those medical issues.

1632
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:20,730
They offered him a fight for the interim
belt and I think it was against Jeremy

1633
01:34:20,730 --> 01:34:21,520
Stevens is fighting this weekend.

1634
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:24,580
They offered frank Yeager and
Jeremy Stephens and so he, Frankie,

1635
01:34:24,581 --> 01:34:27,570
everyone's crazy. That doesn't even make
any sense. That's what Brian saying. Yeah,

1636
01:34:27,730 --> 01:34:31,540
and so then Jeremy and Jeremy
Stevens is fucking dangerous. Yes,

1637
01:34:31,830 --> 01:34:35,440
he is talking about a guy
sleeping dangerous for anybody.

1638
01:34:35,441 --> 01:34:39,580
He's doing such a good fighter
for anybody. He and he is
guns blazing. He's fine.

1639
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:44,200
Although this weekend so on, I know
that's a great fight. So I'm 55 right,

1640
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:47,350
those 40 45 so they offered him all those,

1641
01:34:47,351 --> 01:34:51,640
those 49 offered him Ortega the offered
or take a fight with Jeremy because

1642
01:34:51,641 --> 01:34:53,840
Jeremy is already cut and wait
for this fight or you know,

1643
01:34:53,841 --> 01:34:58,100
at training for this fight, which is only
a few weeks later. And he says, well,

1644
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:01,190
it's interim title. It doesn't mean
anything. I want the real belt fighters.

1645
01:35:01,191 --> 01:35:03,920
Don't take it serious. Well here's
why they shouldn't now. Right.

1646
01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:07,040
Well this is a basic example.
Like why would I fight for interim belt?

1647
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:11,450
You just strip Kolbe. Now
this is us assuming that we
know the whole store. Right?

1648
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:13,850
I don't know the whole story.
I haven't talked to Colby.

1649
01:35:13,851 --> 01:35:17,780
I haven't talked to Dana Jacoby, but
I don't, I think the conversation,

1650
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:22,760
I'm not a fan of the idea of an interim
title unless there's extenuating

1651
01:35:22,761 --> 01:35:25,010
circumstances.
Like someone's got a broken leg,

1652
01:35:25,011 --> 01:35:28,490
they have to be out for six months, but
it should be a year. If they had a year,

1653
01:35:28,491 --> 01:35:30,890
you got to do something so you
wouldn't lose out a year. Correct.

1654
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:35,360
So that's why it made RDA. It made
sense. And also just to play if I'm Dana,

1655
01:35:35,390 --> 01:35:36,320
if hey Woodley,

1656
01:35:36,321 --> 01:35:38,540
we need you to fight and you want
the super fights turning down fights,

1657
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:41,870
what can we do? Let's force the
Sand Creek. This interim belt,

1658
01:35:41,930 --> 01:35:44,780
he's been out a year, which I
like. I wasn't talking about that.

1659
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:46,940
I was talking about Brian
Ortega. Okay, Gotcha.

1660
01:35:46,941 --> 01:35:49,850
Let's talking about Brian or Tayga
because Max Holloway's defended fairly

1661
01:35:49,851 --> 01:35:52,100
recently and he was getting
ready to fight Khabib.

1662
01:35:52,150 --> 01:35:54,860
It's not like he's been out a lot.
They offered him that could be fight.

1663
01:35:54,861 --> 01:35:58,220
He tried to cut weight for it and he
might have fucked himself that way.

1664
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:00,500
Is that what it was? Yeah,
it's entirely possible.

1665
01:36:00,501 --> 01:36:02,150
They're still trying to figure
out what happened. Well,

1666
01:36:02,151 --> 01:36:06,320
one of the pieces of speculation is that
his body started shutting down because

1667
01:36:06,321 --> 01:36:08,840
he went through a real bad cut for the,

1668
01:36:08,870 --> 01:36:12,620
when he was trying to make the
[inaudible] at 55 on super short notes.

1669
01:36:12,621 --> 01:36:15,590
That's a hard thing for him
to make. 55 is a huge, huge,

1670
01:36:15,591 --> 01:36:20,120
he's 25 he's like one 85 yes,
dude. Max is a big fella.

1671
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:25,070
Brian or Tayga is fucking huge to take
them on to take it goes up to 85 I

1672
01:36:25,071 --> 01:36:28,530
couldn't really, I stood next to him. I
was like, how big are you? How is bigger?

1673
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:31,310
Holly's bigger and so this is
the problem with these guys.

1674
01:36:31,310 --> 01:36:33,980
They need a lot of time to get
down to this weight. Right?

1675
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:37,640
So how all the way trying to do that.
This is what, this is pure speculation,

1676
01:36:37,641 --> 01:36:41,390
Holly, we tried to do that
is it was very hard for him.

1677
01:36:41,391 --> 01:36:44,570
His body broke down and then in
cutting weight for this fight,

1678
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:47,630
once his body started the water load,
his body knew what was going on.

1679
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:51,590
It started shutting down.
This is speculation, pure
respect, but here's my point.

1680
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:55,400
You can't make me till you know that
he's going to be out for a certain amount

1681
01:36:55,401 --> 01:36:59,780
of time. It seems like an interim
title belt is almost disrespectful.

1682
01:36:59,990 --> 01:37:02,000
Like he's,
he's the champ makes zero sense,

1683
01:37:02,030 --> 01:37:04,820
but I think it's like it was
a corporate decision find out,

1684
01:37:04,910 --> 01:37:07,190
but I feel like it was a corporate
decision that they went, okay,

1685
01:37:07,370 --> 01:37:11,480
we have to fight. We need
to fill this gap. We have to
fight. Well they asked if I,

1686
01:37:11,481 --> 01:37:14,690
somebody of course we get,
you're talking about some different yeah,

1687
01:37:14,691 --> 01:37:17,630
but I'm saying, I'm saying they go, they
go, we want this gotta be a of fight.

1688
01:37:17,780 --> 01:37:19,370
How about this?
How about you have this,

1689
01:37:19,490 --> 01:37:23,750
how about you give the Colby retains
his interim title because there's

1690
01:37:23,751 --> 01:37:27,410
extenuating circumstances with him
medically. He had to get nasal surgery.

1691
01:37:27,590 --> 01:37:30,500
He's out until November.
Colby gets the next shot.

1692
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:34,250
Whoever the fuck wins his fight.
Colby fights next. Yes. Dream. I see,

1693
01:37:34,251 --> 01:37:35,450
but you haven't talked to your boy Dana.

1694
01:37:35,451 --> 01:37:40,070
Maybe he's saying that maybe every same
stripped there saying you bebe, listen,

1695
01:37:40,071 --> 01:37:42,630
fuck your belt, but you
will get the next shot. Who?

1696
01:37:42,650 --> 01:37:45,900
Everyone's just taking your buy at
hers and they were trying to do some,

1697
01:37:45,901 --> 01:37:49,670
well maybe it was Uzma Uzma and wants
to fight till next and he's like,

1698
01:37:49,671 --> 01:37:51,580
let's do this for the real
number one contender spot.

1699
01:37:51,580 --> 01:37:56,340
Cause Uzman is a guy who has quietly been
beating everybody they put in front of.

1700
01:37:56,390 --> 01:38:00,570
Yes he has. And I love him. His last
fight, I wasn't the most exciting.

1701
01:38:00,630 --> 01:38:03,810
But if you go through,
you know who my has fought,

1702
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:06,360
you look at the way Colby
did it prior to that,

1703
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:11,370
you know you Uzman would have the worst
argument but he has the eye the most

1704
01:38:11,371 --> 01:38:15,150
potential probably like he's like no one
wants to fuck off for the Damien Maia

1705
01:38:15,151 --> 01:38:19,260
fight. I wouldn't agree with you cause
both guys beat Damien might before.

1706
01:38:19,261 --> 01:38:22,290
That was not good. I'm saying other
decisions right. It's not like he was,

1707
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:26,970
he wasn't dare telling people. I met the,
before the Damien Maia fight with Colby,

1708
01:38:26,970 --> 01:38:29,430
Colby didn't have a lot of
big names on his resume.

1709
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:33,630
He hasn't one decision over Damien
Maia. Yeah. So like what do we got here?

1710
01:38:33,810 --> 01:38:35,970
I beat Damien Meyer as
well and his last fight,

1711
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:40,230
although there was a thing about that
fight that bothered me. Two things. One,

1712
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:45,260
the referee chose to separate Damien
Maia from ou smiled when he had him from

1713
01:38:45,721 --> 01:38:47,770
behind.
The wizard.

1714
01:38:47,850 --> 01:38:50,940
Dude was a fucking compromising
position in your submission.

1715
01:38:52,310 --> 01:38:54,600
That was I,
this is not [inaudible] fault.

1716
01:38:54,650 --> 01:38:56,370
This is just the referees fault I serve.

1717
01:38:56,430 --> 01:39:01,140
I severely disagreed and agreed with
Matt Serra who was talking about the guy

1718
01:39:01,141 --> 01:39:03,270
takes the fight on short notice.
He gets to a good position.

1719
01:39:03,390 --> 01:39:06,240
You're telling them to work. You gotta
be careful not to lose a position.

1720
01:39:06,241 --> 01:39:09,510
You're talking about a super high level
wrestler in Eastmont who you can't just

1721
01:39:09,511 --> 01:39:12,990
let go and it was very
worldclass grap like Damien Maia,

1722
01:39:12,991 --> 01:39:16,820
he needs one nano second for
Huseman to make a wrong turn crowd.

1723
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:20,550
The crowd boos,
you can't get upset.

1724
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:24,480
There's a situation that's happening
with this guy has the best chance of

1725
01:39:24,481 --> 01:39:26,340
winning and he's,
he's at the door.

1726
01:39:26,370 --> 01:39:29,460
He's at like step eight out
of 10 he's got the back,

1727
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:32,720
but he might go to nine and then
it was mine might try to defend.

1728
01:39:32,730 --> 01:39:34,860
He might go to 10 and get the
tech correct. Entirely possible.

1729
01:39:34,861 --> 01:39:37,950
This is happening right now. I don't know
how it was. Sounds 70 by the way, but

1730
01:39:39,810 --> 01:39:43,620
even with this Uzman so god damned good,
but you look at one 70 what's,

1731
01:39:43,621 --> 01:39:47,130
where's the fireman? Why does everyone
have to fight for the title right away?

1732
01:39:47,310 --> 01:39:48,450
Let's not kill off all these.

1733
01:39:49,170 --> 01:39:53,190
I think one of the things is because
they want that they need stars. Yeah.

1734
01:39:53,191 --> 01:39:56,550
They want that paper view card to
have a big headliner and you know and

1735
01:39:56,551 --> 01:39:57,384
Woodley's ready.

1736
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:01,920
You can create that with
trilogies with great fights with,

1737
01:40:01,950 --> 01:40:05,190
I mean there's a way they seem to be
a better strategy than to feed her,

1738
01:40:05,850 --> 01:40:08,520
but that's, if you didn't have
a schedule that you had to fill,

1739
01:40:08,521 --> 01:40:09,930
see boxing's different in that.

1740
01:40:09,931 --> 01:40:12,310
Boxing doesn't have a schedule
they have to fill that way.

1741
01:40:12,390 --> 01:40:15,090
Who's making the schedule? Why do that?
To fill that schedule? I Dunno man.

1742
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:18,020
100 fighters on staff.
Will they commit to us?

1743
01:40:18,021 --> 01:40:19,980
You they have to commit to
certain amount of fights. Right.

1744
01:40:19,981 --> 01:40:24,510
With Fox and paper view picture of Vituro
standing with Dana in front of their

1745
01:40:24,511 --> 01:40:27,430
fucking board of fighters and trying
to figure out who fights. Who. No,

1746
01:40:27,570 --> 01:40:30,710
I've got a headache. I almost blacked
out. Just looking at the board.

1747
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:32,910
A hard drinking about 500 fighters.

1748
01:40:32,911 --> 01:40:36,120
You're responsible for putting into
fights and how many people in Sean Shelby

1749
01:40:36,121 --> 01:40:39,540
and Mick Maynard and they're
running around Joe Silva's
in his underwear rolling

1750
01:40:39,541 --> 01:40:43,720
around with his buddies and, and Joe Silva
fucking Virginia laughing his ass off.

1751
01:40:43,721 --> 01:40:45,780
I was still, he's like, I
got out bitch. Yeah. He goes,

1752
01:40:45,781 --> 01:40:49,500
I'm doing karate in my basement,
but just reading books and chilling.

1753
01:40:49,630 --> 01:40:54,070
Mick mic Maynard and Sean Shelby
with 10 fucking uh, and you know

1754
01:40:54,290 --> 01:40:57,100
Silva, Joe Silva's, all the three
of them have one thing in common.

1755
01:40:57,101 --> 01:40:59,830
All Merce super smart dude.
Yeah, yeah. For shows.

1756
01:40:59,930 --> 01:41:02,860
Matchmake it's not like there's
like, Oh let's do this. They're very,

1757
01:41:02,861 --> 01:41:05,880
very smart guys. Learned about a
lot of books from Joe Sova. Look at,

1758
01:41:05,890 --> 01:41:07,790
look at that board and look at
all those names and that board.

1759
01:41:07,870 --> 01:41:10,930
Something that doesn't give you the
top 15 that's still gives me a headache

1760
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:14,350
really in every weight class.
It gives me a fucking headache.

1761
01:41:14,670 --> 01:41:17,680
It doesn't give you a headache. Yeah.
Cause they're not all called get ranking,

1762
01:41:17,681 --> 01:41:18,190
dude.

1763
01:41:18,190 --> 01:41:23,190
All those guys we can figure out
the match on and it takes you long.

1764
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:27,310
And then some of them take
care of themselves. One to
Europe, the [inaudible].

1765
01:41:27,370 --> 01:41:30,670
I mean it's between driving
Ferrari's and making deals.

1766
01:41:30,671 --> 01:41:33,700
You don't have time to make these matchups
got to prove you have time to hate on

1767
01:41:33,701 --> 01:41:36,040
people. On Instagram. You've
got time. Oh, hate on people.

1768
01:41:36,130 --> 01:41:40,120
That's the hardest timers.
Those numbers,

1769
01:41:40,121 --> 01:41:43,030
those numbers give me a goddamn
headache. Yeah. Who's going to fight?

1770
01:41:43,031 --> 01:41:46,090
Who Gets Chris?
That's easy part really freaks me out.

1771
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:49,300
This is one of those people have his
phone number and text him all the time.

1772
01:41:49,390 --> 01:41:54,000
Probably not got that many. Just
taking my phone buzzing. No, no.

1773
01:41:54,010 --> 01:41:56,080
That seat. What's crazy?
If you think this is easy,

1774
01:41:56,081 --> 01:42:01,081
you went through 1515 through
fucking 100 complicated part

1775
01:42:02,770 --> 01:42:05,410
number 50 guys gonna
fight 43 where they fight.

1776
01:42:05,411 --> 01:42:08,590
When he put them fly him in from
Brazil, you're not ranked. Right?

1777
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:11,830
So until you crack that top
15 nobody gives a shit. Yeah,

1778
01:42:11,831 --> 01:42:14,170
but you still got to get matchups
for him. He got a match, a match ups.

1779
01:42:14,650 --> 01:42:17,800
And how often are you getting those
matchups you getting in a fight once a six

1780
01:42:17,801 --> 01:42:22,270
months. Once a year. You know,
he's given some risk on the left.

1781
01:42:22,271 --> 01:42:26,500
They have the pound for pound
rankings. Hmm. That's very strange.

1782
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:31,240
Mm hmm. Yeah. It almost mirrors
completely the website though.

1783
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:35,920
Like that's the very first who was
fighting cris Cyborg soon or that does,

1784
01:42:35,980 --> 01:42:39,190
yes. Supposed to descend together
and works pissed about it.

1785
01:42:39,191 --> 01:42:42,400
She wanted to do September, but a man
I knew it says to wait til December,

1786
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:46,450
but she's done. She said she put some
weight on Shit. She needs time to,

1787
01:42:46,451 --> 01:42:48,490
she gonna fight her on sideways
and not happy about it.

1788
01:42:48,820 --> 01:42:51,330
Why did she want to fight
in September? Cyborg. She,

1789
01:42:51,390 --> 01:42:55,630
she fights once every year and she's
like, let's go man. But she also goes,

1790
01:42:55,631 --> 01:42:57,490
all right, well if you're like,
give me that. Give me someone else.

1791
01:42:57,491 --> 01:43:00,070
I don't want to wait till December.
I can plate bolts but fight me.

1792
01:43:00,220 --> 01:43:03,450
If a Cyborg does decide,
um,

1793
01:43:04,150 --> 01:43:06,310
to like to leave the UFC,

1794
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:09,250
are they going to be able to get her
fights somewhere else? It doesn't matter.

1795
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:11,980
You'll see. He's like in
her fights. Right. But who
else is going to be able to,

1796
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:15,160
it's not gonna be easy for her wherever
she goes. No where she goes. No, no,

1797
01:43:15,370 --> 01:43:17,320
too good. Yeah. Well, two good.

1798
01:43:17,321 --> 01:43:21,250
And also there's a lot of
[inaudible] 45 yeah. I mean,

1799
01:43:21,251 --> 01:43:24,760
you saw big Megan Anderson looked Meagan,
excuse me,

1800
01:43:24,790 --> 01:43:28,750
looked when she fought Holly. Holly Holm.
I mean she looked a lot bigger than her.

1801
01:43:29,010 --> 01:43:33,400
He gave her a warm up and then had her
fight Cyborg. That would have been better.

1802
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:35,380
I wouldn't kill her off with Holly Holm,

1803
01:43:35,381 --> 01:43:39,330
who's this animal because now you don't
have a competitor for Cyborg and answer

1804
01:43:39,331 --> 01:43:42,110
would've been a fun one for Cyborg.
We did think that, you know,

1805
01:43:42,130 --> 01:43:46,600
Meghan is physically very big, very
strong, likes to stand up and bang,

1806
01:43:46,601 --> 01:43:50,890
but now like at least a part of her game
for that fights been pretty exposed.

1807
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:53,960
That's to be honest. First find the
UFC fight and Holly, Holly Holm,

1808
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:59,020
I know what she did get kind of wrestled
and dominated and on the ground by

1809
01:43:59,151 --> 01:44:02,870
Hollywood, which is not, you
know what I mean? So you're
like, hmm, that's, but still,

1810
01:44:02,871 --> 01:44:03,704
it's like

1811
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:08,020
that was a plan for that
fight to Cyborg needs.

1812
01:44:08,021 --> 01:44:10,820
But cyborg needs more like stars
in competitors. Like stories.

1813
01:44:10,821 --> 01:44:13,940
Why kill one off with Holly?
Oh, 100% but the thing is like,

1814
01:44:13,941 --> 01:44:16,580
at least that's a fight where
there's a name and a name.

1815
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:20,690
So I can sell some pay per views with
that fight. Well, for Holly at least,

1816
01:44:20,691 --> 01:44:24,260
I mean it's like Megan Anderson at least
has some hype behind her. She comes in,

1817
01:44:24,261 --> 01:44:27,650
it's a good fight for hall. Holly took
a big risk taking that fight tests.

1818
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:32,570
You know what if she loses, you know, bad
situation and going up to 45 you know,

1819
01:44:32,571 --> 01:44:36,380
staying at 45 when she's a
legit $30 sideboards, I going
to fight Holly. She goes,

1820
01:44:36,381 --> 01:44:39,310
no, you just don't beat that girl and
get a rematch and, and I just beat you.

1821
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:43,160
So who fights are now? Yeah. So now
you're in the situation where we're like,

1822
01:44:43,161 --> 01:44:45,870
all right, let's call up
a men and Nunez, right?

1823
01:44:47,570 --> 01:44:51,230
Fighting Cris Cyborg is very
intriguing to me. Way More dangerous.

1824
01:44:51,260 --> 01:44:54,250
I think that's going to be more
dangerous than one way more damage.

1825
01:44:54,251 --> 01:44:57,830
But she never fought anybody that
anybody cyborgs ever fought. Correct.

1826
01:44:57,890 --> 01:45:01,080
Other than Gina than that Thai girl.
Oh,

1827
01:45:02,940 --> 01:45:07,700
shoring a barge. You know,
she, she knocked her down
with a front kick to the face.

1828
01:45:07,910 --> 01:45:09,080
I would say a prime.

1829
01:45:09,081 --> 01:45:13,700
Holly's more stronger because Holly
and Holly can get up to that weight.

1830
01:45:13,730 --> 01:45:18,110
Amanda knows me. She's coming up.
She's smaller, you know. I agree.

1831
01:45:19,550 --> 01:45:20,640
Yes. Yeah, for sure.

1832
01:45:20,650 --> 01:45:24,770
Holly is awesome and super highly skilled
and a counter striker stylistically is

1833
01:45:24,771 --> 01:45:27,920
more dangerous. Cyborg and cyborgs
beat her pretty candidly. Yeah.

1834
01:45:27,921 --> 01:45:31,070
Maybe if she followed me.
Holly is a little older.

1835
01:45:31,100 --> 01:45:35,730
She's like 36 now manifests coming
forward and cyber coming forward there to

1836
01:45:35,750 --> 01:45:38,750
Mack trucks. One's a way
bigger fucking Brazilian truck.

1837
01:45:39,590 --> 01:45:41,180
What do you think's going to happen?
I didn't know I,

1838
01:45:41,181 --> 01:45:44,180
that's a really good point cause
I didn't know. I feel like, uh,

1839
01:45:44,181 --> 01:45:48,000
Amanda Nunez is his shoulders.
Why? She just looks everybody

1840
01:45:49,580 --> 01:45:54,580
no small and she does press
forward relentlessly against that.

1841
01:45:54,980 --> 01:45:56,780
Here's the thing,
she doesn't have to fight that way.

1842
01:45:57,020 --> 01:45:58,880
We're assuming that she
has to fight that way.

1843
01:45:58,940 --> 01:46:01,190
You tell me she didn't use
the footwork like Holly. Well,

1844
01:46:01,191 --> 01:46:05,960
she used to a lot of foot work in great
hands, great hands. She punches hard.

1845
01:46:05,961 --> 01:46:07,250
She punches long arms,

1846
01:46:10,180 --> 01:46:13,450
long arms and punches hard. You know,
as long runs and punches harder,

1847
01:46:14,460 --> 01:46:18,670
hurt inside board. There's not a woman
alive is the greatest of all time.

1848
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:23,240
It's definitely dangerous fighter.
I think Amanda Nunez has more technique,

1849
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:28,150
but I think when you come up like that
and you have this animal Cyborg, it just,

1850
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:33,260
I think, scary. You get Claressa shields
to learn how to sprawl. You were seeing,

1851
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:38,770
she holds her. Jamie bring up
Chrissa shields and Cyborg sparring.

1852
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:42,350
Yeah. Oh, that black guy that she
was a champion. Black black boxer,

1853
01:46:42,410 --> 01:46:46,910
black curl curl, and he said,
God, thank you. Said Gus,

1854
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:50,010
they guy. My manager made
a mistake. Like sometimes I

1855
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:53,280
say, Brian are really no,
she's amazing. She can bang.

1856
01:46:53,780 --> 01:46:56,780
They I'm boring and they bang. Bang. Now.

1857
01:46:56,870 --> 01:47:00,700
Now Imagine Dema nother
professional female founder.

1858
01:47:00,710 --> 01:47:03,280
You can get down like zero. Oh, and
she's an Olympic medalist. Brian.

1859
01:47:03,610 --> 01:47:07,860
The two times I watch this. Let's watch
a little of this. Yeah, there's zero.

1860
01:47:08,190 --> 01:47:12,190
I would pay money for you to jump in
there with either one of these girls. No,

1861
01:47:12,230 --> 01:47:15,190
thank you. I'm not hurt. Yeah,
I just want to see me. Look at,

1862
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:16,740
look at her fucking skill level.

1863
01:47:16,950 --> 01:47:20,550
Like the way she's waiting with a counter
with straight shots and use that jab

1864
01:47:20,551 --> 01:47:24,090
and go to the body and then up to the
head. Chris is doing work. Oh yeah.

1865
01:47:24,190 --> 01:47:26,820
Chris Landress man,
she's fucking dangerous.

1866
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:31,230
And Claressa correct me if I'm wrong.
I believe she fights it a heavier weight.

1867
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:32,250
Yes. No, you're right.

1868
01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:37,350
I think she fights at 65 is that what her
weight class and she's the best female

1869
01:47:37,351 --> 01:47:39,900
box in the world, right? Yeah. And
look at her fucking counterstrikes.

1870
01:47:39,901 --> 01:47:43,050
Look how she goes to the body and to the
head can get that to that right to the

1871
01:47:43,051 --> 01:47:46,830
body and right over the top. And she's
on Cyborg to Matt. They're throwing down,

1872
01:47:46,831 --> 01:47:50,280
dude. She's winning the rounds. But cyborg
is holding her own is my point. Oh yeah.

1873
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:54,660
And by the way of Cyborg Cyborg could
kick her legs. Claressa would be,

1874
01:47:54,661 --> 01:47:56,910
I'm just saying when we talked
about the Amanda Nunez fight,

1875
01:47:56,911 --> 01:48:00,900
we talked about her standup.
It's like I get that sideboards,

1876
01:48:00,930 --> 01:48:04,230
very big man and deals with
high level boxes for sure

1877
01:48:06,270 --> 01:48:07,770
is my favorite female fighter.

1878
01:48:08,370 --> 01:48:12,660
The only difference is
Claressa is standing right
in front of her and pressing

1879
01:48:12,661 --> 01:48:14,010
her and she's trying to put it on her.

1880
01:48:14,220 --> 01:48:17,760
I don't think Amanda Nunez Smart Strategy
would be to fight this with the best

1881
01:48:17,761 --> 01:48:22,240
strategy would be to use the aggression
of Cyborg and try to counter and glance

1882
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:25,580
when she can and get out. Has she ever
fought that way before though? Well,

1883
01:48:25,610 --> 01:48:28,710
can she can't. She was smart
enough. Matt Brown is a genius.

1884
01:48:28,711 --> 01:48:31,300
She fought real slick
against Raquel Pennington.

1885
01:48:31,310 --> 01:48:35,850
He wasn't just packing and mauling.
What I say he said Matt, but Mike, Mike,

1886
01:48:36,390 --> 01:48:40,230
Mike, Mike Man. Mike's crushed.
He has champion in his own right.

1887
01:48:40,260 --> 01:48:44,800
Great fighter himself. Yeah, some
lost to his hook. Josie Alto money.

1888
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:48,600
A lot of money. Dan Lambert put a
lot of money in American top team.

1889
01:48:48,780 --> 01:48:50,310
That mother fucker.
If it wasn't for him,

1890
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:54,650
it wasn't for Dan Lambert
and his contributions to the
state of MMA would be a s

1891
01:48:54,750 --> 01:48:57,720
a percentage or two lower than it is now.
I couldn't agree more.

1892
01:48:57,721 --> 01:49:00,560
It's a big no,
no a lot.

1893
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:03,900
He took him under their wing and brought
them up and they just built a new place.

1894
01:49:03,901 --> 01:49:07,350
He put in dormitories, built a giant
gym, like built it from the ground up,

1895
01:49:07,351 --> 01:49:10,050
bought a piece of land to
put a fucking structure up.

1896
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:13,320
He's a monster beast and amazing
Dan Lambertson the animal,

1897
01:49:13,350 --> 01:49:16,410
they need to put him in the
UFC hall of fame. No bullshit.

1898
01:49:16,470 --> 01:49:18,520
No one should be in some sort of MMA home.

1899
01:49:19,060 --> 01:49:23,970
So I mean if guys like at least think
about double the amount of money that he

1900
01:49:23,971 --> 01:49:26,850
had to invest that time he had taken
the fact that it wasn't making any money

1901
01:49:26,851 --> 01:49:29,070
out of it.
It's a passion project pass.

1902
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:32,820
He lost a lot of money and he got fucked
over by a bunch of people to that real,

1903
01:49:32,821 --> 01:49:35,550
no need to name names, but
he'll, he'll tell you personally,

1904
01:49:35,580 --> 01:49:39,540
he got fucked over by a bunch of
guys that he trusted and over the,

1905
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:43,380
over the years he learned who could
trust and who you can and develop this

1906
01:49:43,381 --> 01:49:46,860
incredible school and this incredible
Jim and I mean it's one of the best

1907
01:49:46,870 --> 01:49:50,120
facilities on the planet earth when it
comes to MMA training and keep people,

1908
01:49:50,170 --> 01:49:53,740
many high level guys. Yeah.
Unbelievable. Yeah. This is it right now.

1909
01:49:53,741 --> 01:49:56,290
I mean it's crazy,
phenomenal, phenomenal gym.

1910
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:58,840
But it's [inaudible] investment.

1911
01:49:58,841 --> 01:50:01,860
The fact that he had the balls to put the
money up for something like that long,

1912
01:50:02,050 --> 01:50:02,930
long ass time with it.

1913
01:50:02,940 --> 01:50:06,670
The first time I ever saw Hector Lombard
and I walked across the mat and I,

1914
01:50:06,730 --> 01:50:11,620
I'd never quite seen anybody that thick
and, and he had, he was not Cuban.

1915
01:50:11,621 --> 01:50:14,650
Jean saw those Yoel Romero was,
he fight out and they were like,

1916
01:50:14,651 --> 01:50:18,140
at the time it was 85 and I didn't
believe it. He says another things.

1917
01:50:18,340 --> 01:50:23,320
I'm just up rice and beans
and garlic. Chicken. No,

1918
01:50:23,321 --> 01:50:26,410
Hector, Hector. You ever have
that garlic chicken from dude?

1919
01:50:29,370 --> 01:50:33,460
God Damn,
that Shit Love Cuban food to man.

1920
01:50:33,670 --> 01:50:37,040
They have that garlic chicken with
onions or the lemon sauce to my,

1921
01:50:37,130 --> 01:50:40,840
now my mouth is watering smell of it.

1922
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:45,490
I've been doing that fucking a Cuban
slash cans and rice on the side. Come on.

1923
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:48,820
John Culture. I love Cuba. I love cute.

1924
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:51,920
I like the Calorie counting or knows
Joey does, but I love, no, not my job.

1925
01:50:52,180 --> 01:50:56,920
I love Cuban Miami and Miami is great
because it because of the Cubans.

1926
01:50:57,100 --> 01:51:01,340
It's a big part of it for sure.
For sure. There's such a blast. Oh,

1927
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:03,340
that's 30 inches.
I fucking love him.

1928
01:51:03,430 --> 01:51:05,770
I love him to make the best
cigars on the planet earth.

1929
01:51:05,860 --> 01:51:08,860
Everybody knows that and good looking,
not so hard to get anywhere.

1930
01:51:08,900 --> 01:51:11,160
They used to be like
get a serious thing once

1931
01:51:12,790 --> 01:51:13,990
you get some fake ones too.

1932
01:51:14,020 --> 01:51:17,590
There's a limited amount of land that
grow it on the the most precious land.

1933
01:51:17,830 --> 01:51:21,400
I think it's something ridiculously
small. Cigars. Yeah. Yeah.

1934
01:51:21,401 --> 01:51:25,240
I think there's the VA,
VA whole a Baha'i.

1935
01:51:25,241 --> 01:51:29,830
What is the name of the area? There's
one area where they grow these happy,

1936
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:33,610
I don't care.
We're going to find out the soil.

1937
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:36,160
There's something really
special but special.

1938
01:51:36,460 --> 01:51:38,830
Something about the mineral
content in the soil yet.

1939
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:44,200
That way you can buy a plot of land here
and the wines like 30 bucks a bottle

1940
01:51:44,830 --> 01:51:49,450
for whatever reason because of where the
sun hits. And what time just over here,

1941
01:51:49,451 --> 01:51:54,370
like the next plot over. It's worth like
the vines. Yeah. It's $100 bottle of wine,

1942
01:51:55,720 --> 01:51:59,220
a Bajo and the semi VL tow regions.

1943
01:51:59,221 --> 01:52:02,590
So the Pinata del Rio province,

1944
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:07,810
it's located at the western end of Cuban
contains the view view, view El Da.

1945
01:52:08,770 --> 01:52:13,240
That VL to a Bajo is
where everybody wants to.

1946
01:52:13,241 --> 01:52:16,050
Guards from nowhere in the world
grows tobacco better than Cuba Lounge.

1947
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:19,360
So that area though grows these cigars.

1948
01:52:19,361 --> 01:52:23,120
Like if you ever had a really
good like Hoyle Demana Ray,

1949
01:52:23,121 --> 01:52:26,500
double corona for have Havana,
this is what you want to do bro.

1950
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:31,180
You want to eat a fat steak?
I got fat Ribeye. My mouth is.

1951
01:52:31,270 --> 01:52:33,420
And do you carpeted that nearby?

1952
01:52:33,690 --> 01:52:38,690
You sit there with a double espresso to
guy than a ridiculously fat cigar that

1953
01:52:39,491 --> 01:52:41,050
gets you high after two pumps.

1954
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:46,640
Ah Yeah. Yes. Cuban cigar.

1955
01:52:46,641 --> 01:52:51,260
But here's the of drug tigers at my feet
so I can squish my Phoenix drugged up

1956
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:55,460
task quilts. Yes. Yeah.

1957
01:52:55,580 --> 01:52:58,710
Nichold up fucking tag
all heroin mountain guys.

1958
01:52:59,060 --> 01:53:01,790
You ever seen those guys roll those
cigars? It's pretty impressive.

1959
01:53:02,260 --> 01:53:06,920
It's a skill thing isn't
craftsmanship thing. Yeah there's not,

1960
01:53:07,010 --> 01:53:10,880
it's not simple like rolling a joint. I
thought it was done between shot fat too.

1961
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:15,770
Beautiful, beautiful Cuban
Cuban. Are these people doing it?

1962
01:53:15,771 --> 01:53:18,030
They, they're skilled man. They,

1963
01:53:18,090 --> 01:53:22,280
they know which tobacco leafs to
take and how to put it together.

1964
01:53:22,281 --> 01:53:24,740
And what you put on the outside is
different than what's in the inside.

1965
01:53:24,950 --> 01:53:29,540
And this fucking one guy was watching at
the airport some place near the airport

1966
01:53:29,541 --> 01:53:33,470
rather where they would roll cigars.
Are you going to go and watch them do it?

1967
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:36,140
And it's like you stand in front
of the windows. Dude puffing us.

1968
01:53:36,150 --> 01:53:40,460
So this was in Miami. I
went with Joey Way, way,

1969
01:53:40,461 --> 01:53:41,510
way back in the day.

1970
01:53:41,511 --> 01:53:44,720
There was a place where you could go
where you could watch some people roll

1971
01:53:44,721 --> 01:53:48,590
cigars and so they would, they would
roll the cigars in front of you,

1972
01:53:48,591 --> 01:53:51,200
impress him and put it all together.
Just like this guy here,

1973
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:53,960
he had like a few
moisture. Yeah. But dude,

1974
01:53:53,961 --> 01:53:58,690
it's impressive because their skill
like that. Well the craftsman,

1975
01:53:59,020 --> 01:54:00,650
yeah,
they knew how to do it.

1976
01:54:00,651 --> 01:54:04,910
Like he's trimming it and they're doing
it all by hand and by feel and he knows

1977
01:54:04,911 --> 01:54:06,590
how much to put in the cigar.
Like look at this.

1978
01:54:06,770 --> 01:54:10,370
So now he's sitting in front of him.
This, this way. Your smoke. Yes.

1979
01:54:10,490 --> 01:54:12,990
So he's rolling that bitch up.
Oh look.

1980
01:54:12,991 --> 01:54:16,640
See he's broken it all up by hand and
he's getting his finger wet and wet and

1981
01:54:16,641 --> 01:54:18,080
down the [inaudible].
Yeah dude,

1982
01:54:18,081 --> 01:54:22,030
it's seriously skilled labor and you've
got to think this guy might be rolling.

1983
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:23,900
Beautiful hands.
I have a question.

1984
01:54:23,901 --> 01:54:26,750
Might be rolling 20 of those
in the same box and look,

1985
01:54:26,751 --> 01:54:31,200
see at cuts it with that knife man.
Oh fuck yeah.

1986
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:33,980
I have a question. Pinches
it down. Seals the end.

1987
01:54:34,390 --> 01:54:37,460
This is beautiful man for you think
he's doing extra because the cameras are

1988
01:54:37,461 --> 01:54:38,570
there. No, no, no. This is how they do it.

1989
01:54:38,571 --> 01:54:40,850
I want to still be pro and
then this is the outside,

1990
01:54:40,851 --> 01:54:43,550
so that's the inside of the leaf.
Then they take the outside.

1991
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:46,340
So that is the outside, which
is, what do they call that shit?

1992
01:54:46,580 --> 01:54:49,610
What do they call it? The outside of
the leaf is a wrap. Is it the rap?

1993
01:54:49,660 --> 01:54:51,560
I think they call it the rap.
So they,

1994
01:54:51,650 --> 01:54:55,730
he trims it to perfect size and then he
gets this bitch up there and it rolls up.

1995
01:54:55,730 --> 01:54:59,180
Mother fucker at that gets
pedicle it tight. You fuck.

1996
01:54:59,181 --> 01:55:02,780
Look at how he's like backing it up and
slow it down and add a little moisture.

1997
01:55:02,781 --> 01:55:04,820
Here. Let me get my hand on
my pants. Keep talking. Yeah.

1998
01:55:04,821 --> 01:55:09,260
These guys are skilled laborers. I
mean this is, do you guys love cigars?

1999
01:55:09,560 --> 01:55:11,300
I do enjoy a cigar every now and again,

2000
01:55:11,330 --> 01:55:14,330
but not like you're not doing it every
Friday night or some shit. Hey, you're,

2001
01:55:14,331 --> 01:55:18,820
you're a chronic drug store. I have a
question. You're a pop kind of sore. Um,

2002
01:55:18,970 --> 01:55:22,760
though I was thinking about this. They
sprayed out. Fuck. Got a weed, right?

2003
01:55:22,790 --> 01:55:27,010
They spray it with lots of pesticides do.
Then I believe that a lot.

2004
01:55:27,011 --> 01:55:30,080
Like you should talk to
Gino. No, I actually have.

2005
01:55:30,140 --> 01:55:33,860
I actually have it on good
authority. Oh Shit. What's up Laura?

2006
01:55:33,861 --> 01:55:36,470
It's like pesticides or
organic pesticides as a whole.

2007
01:55:36,540 --> 01:55:40,990
I have it on good authority that when
you're buying a lot of ways they sprayed

2008
01:55:40,991 --> 01:55:44,220
the whole because it's,
it's valuable and it gets moldy,

2009
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:48,510
so they will spray it to death.
Then it doesn't really get washed.

2010
01:55:48,511 --> 01:55:51,360
You're you're s from from my,
when you do it in bulk,

2011
01:55:51,361 --> 01:55:54,420
you're buying people who deal
in this stuff in big bulk.

2012
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:57,060
They kind of money,

2013
01:55:57,061 --> 01:56:00,850
money spread and then you smoke that.

2014
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:05,190
I wonder what that does. I
wonder. Fun. Those things.

2015
01:56:05,710 --> 01:56:10,680
Got The weed. Fuck your
pathetic. Asking a question.

2016
01:56:10,740 --> 01:56:13,950
Fuck you. Pesticide. I just
come on smoke yet. Yeah,

2017
01:56:14,130 --> 01:56:18,210
but I think as much squash it. I don't
think they do. They definitely don't.

2018
01:56:18,211 --> 01:56:22,980
You think though, you're seeing
those go. How about this?

2019
01:56:24,150 --> 01:56:24,983
How about this?

2020
01:56:25,380 --> 01:56:28,620
When you're counting $1 million when you
have this money counters and you're in

2021
01:56:28,621 --> 01:56:31,800
a room and they're kinda like there
cause a lot of is this cash, right?

2022
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:35,520
Guess what you gotta touch one. You might
want to go in there with a mask. Why?

2023
01:56:35,610 --> 01:56:40,140
Number one you can actually get a runny
nose from the cocaine residue and you

2024
01:56:40,141 --> 01:56:44,310
get sick cause the, the, the
dirt that comes off money.

2025
01:56:44,910 --> 01:56:48,000
Have you ever seen what they found
on money? They found shit. I'm money.

2026
01:56:48,090 --> 01:56:52,020
First of all, every, every dollar
bill has some residue of cocaine.

2027
01:56:52,021 --> 01:56:56,100
Like every like not just dollar bills.
22 yes, yes. But forget all that.

2028
01:56:56,970 --> 01:57:00,360
They found that this guy did this now son,
a bunch of different telehealth.

2029
01:57:00,390 --> 01:57:05,390
They even found White Rhino Horn powder
on all fun and just a bunch of the bills

2030
01:57:05,881 --> 01:57:09,450
because it gets, you know the
number of times that it's, you know,

2031
01:57:09,540 --> 01:57:12,630
but they found crazy shape rhino.
They found cocaine,

2032
01:57:12,631 --> 01:57:16,830
they found all kinds of weird
party and broke the rhino powders.

2033
01:57:16,831 --> 01:57:20,430
The weirdest and that weird cause cause
probably some poachers are dealing,

2034
01:57:20,431 --> 01:57:22,860
turning back and forth.
Here's the thing about the rhino thing.

2035
01:57:22,890 --> 01:57:25,460
There's nothing that shows that
that does anything. No, no.

2036
01:57:25,470 --> 01:57:29,790
We were talking about the bear bile.
The Rhino thing just fucked up.

2037
01:57:29,820 --> 01:57:34,380
That's the craziest thing. Soltes killing
rhinos. Just like almost to say, oh,

2038
01:57:34,381 --> 01:57:38,170
this tea is made out of dead rhino.
Come have a seat. Right. We are.

2039
01:57:38,180 --> 01:57:41,200
We are very fancy gentleman.
We were drinking rhino tea,

2040
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:44,070
so you're telling me if you're weird.
It doesn't make me think he's up.

2041
01:57:44,160 --> 01:57:48,780
If someone's like, dude, we got Rhino
Horn, Tia like, well, you know what man,

2042
01:57:48,781 --> 01:57:52,650
if you're far enough removed from the
actual source of the misery and you don't

2043
01:57:52,651 --> 01:57:56,430
actually see the Rhino get shot in the
head and his horn hacked off and you just

2044
01:57:56,431 --> 01:58:01,350
think you're a fancy guy with a gold
Rolex on drinking some rhino tea. Yeah.

2045
01:58:01,450 --> 01:58:06,450
You know what I mean? There's a lot of
that elusive and want to be exclusive.

2046
01:58:06,510 --> 01:58:08,760
They love it and I think it was called,
what is it called?

2047
01:58:08,761 --> 01:58:11,190
The Green Hills of Africa,
I think it's called the Hemingway book.

2048
01:58:11,670 --> 01:58:15,600
And he describes killing a rhino and a,
it was done back then.

2049
01:58:15,700 --> 01:58:18,600
And what's your second one,
Bro? Oh yeah. Getting nuts.

2050
01:58:19,450 --> 01:58:21,480
Start throwing up in that in the fucking,

2051
01:58:21,510 --> 01:58:25,940
in the heat just flew from the other side
of the planet Sun. Part of what a weak,

2052
01:58:26,070 --> 01:58:29,640
why I went and bought all that weed last
week is because the new rules came into

2053
01:58:29,641 --> 01:58:34,200
place. Test for pesticide. Ooh.
They had six months, which is,

2054
01:58:34,201 --> 01:58:37,700
I guess it started as so Jamie's like,
give me that pesticide covered. We'd son,

2055
01:58:37,950 --> 01:58:42,260
I don't want you to bullshit ass clean.
We like it. He's just now starting,

2056
01:58:42,261 --> 01:58:43,041
so that makes sense.
Well,

2057
01:58:43,041 --> 01:58:47,350
we smoked is what I've been smoking a
lot lately as blunt with the tobacco on

2058
01:58:47,351 --> 01:58:50,230
the outside. On the
inside. Yeah. I stuck that

2059
01:58:51,910 --> 01:58:55,500
poor pink lungs. No, get a little buzz on.

2060
01:58:55,510 --> 01:58:57,430
It's like a whole cigar type down now.

2061
01:58:57,520 --> 01:59:00,430
We'll blow buzz you not doing it every
day. Right now I'm hooked on cigarettes.

2062
01:59:00,430 --> 01:59:02,960
Thanks Joe. Well, um, I got back in,

2063
01:59:02,961 --> 01:59:07,870
you would again with Chappelle Chappelle
smoked one with me and I was like, dude,

2064
01:59:07,871 --> 01:59:11,470
I'm like elevated here. He goes, it's
nice right there. Go. It's weird. I go,

2065
01:59:11,471 --> 01:59:13,600
it's like the tobacco
mixed in with the weed.

2066
01:59:13,601 --> 01:59:16,510
I forgot about it and the last time
I had really smoked one before.

2067
01:59:16,511 --> 01:59:20,650
That was a with Charlie Murphy.
What does that say? Jewel user sue.

2068
01:59:20,651 --> 01:59:22,920
What over the addictive e-cigarette.

2069
01:59:22,950 --> 01:59:27,430
That's given him too much nicotine so
they fucking babies. Well, let just stop.

2070
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:29,290
Last time I saw Chappelle,

2071
01:59:29,291 --> 01:59:32,890
he was in the back is using
one of the fucking vapor pens.

2072
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:35,890
Here's my doctor says this way. Ben
Island. Have you ever looked into that?

2073
01:59:36,250 --> 01:59:39,850
Because that's not, they don't know for
sure if it's that much better for you.

2074
01:59:39,880 --> 01:59:42,940
Vaping? Yeah. Yeah. I
don't know if it's better,

2075
01:59:42,941 --> 01:59:47,910
but I know a lot of people
say it's better. I don't know.
It's right. What is your,

2076
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:50,060
you aren't getting smoked with a vape,
but it's,

2077
01:59:50,061 --> 01:59:53,380
but that's vote right in that smoked
like in that container. There's alcohol,

2078
01:59:53,381 --> 01:59:56,400
there's all sorts of weird
shit and fuck that stuffs.

2079
01:59:56,950 --> 01:59:58,450
Well that's the thing
with those we'd ones too,

2080
01:59:58,451 --> 02:00:02,770
I ran into some due to told me he
makes it with MCT oil. Yeah. Okay.

2081
02:00:02,920 --> 02:00:05,280
Well why not? I'll smell oils. Oil.

2082
02:00:05,281 --> 02:00:09,790
I guess you are ingesting
it in your lungs. Yeah.

2083
02:00:10,090 --> 02:00:12,260
Yeah. You're, you're doing something. I'm,

2084
02:00:12,280 --> 02:00:15,250
I'm getting into psychedelics have
decided you've decided I'm not kidding.

2085
02:00:15,340 --> 02:00:19,330
We did DMT together. When I do it again
and all of that. I want to do acid.

2086
02:00:19,630 --> 02:00:23,260
I've never done that. I've done
mushrooms many times. You know what? No,

2087
02:00:23,261 --> 02:00:25,510
I like it to him in life.
I'm getting into meditation.

2088
02:00:26,110 --> 02:00:27,490
I'm getting into meditation to zoom.

2089
02:00:27,491 --> 02:00:31,720
Do you want to use attention once you use
the tank? I've done that. My Ego Dude,

2090
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:35,050
you can let go of your ego. It's
right here for you. You want,

2091
02:00:35,410 --> 02:00:40,180
remember the one time we used the
tank in San Francisco? Yeah, I do,

2092
02:00:40,181 --> 02:00:43,720
Bro. Not For me. Get Bad. Brennan
decided you're free to say it.

2093
02:00:44,270 --> 02:00:49,000
Said Ram decided he was bored and
he yanked one off the jacked up.

2094
02:00:49,010 --> 02:00:51,460
Maintain his war was like,
dude, my Dick is the way

2095
02:00:53,330 --> 02:00:56,020
people lying in your calm deals.
That's so rude. And you know,

2096
02:00:56,021 --> 02:00:58,630
that happens all the time and that's
why I'm never doing a public. Okay,

2097
02:00:58,780 --> 02:01:01,710
well let me tell you something.
This tank unless, uh,

2098
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:06,310
I need my shorts on breast from fucking
good morning America unless he's jacking

2099
02:01:06,311 --> 02:01:09,520
off in the tank. Right. He's the only
one who's been in it. Don't let it,

2100
02:01:09,521 --> 02:01:12,370
don't let this degenerate in there
because I'll tell you right now, Jamie,

2101
02:01:13,140 --> 02:01:16,230
this fucking guy was squeezed. Went off
right now. Please went off from tank.

2102
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:21,070
So disrespectful.
I thought this was a big place.

2103
02:01:21,190 --> 02:01:23,980
I thought that they filter
the water comes out.

2104
02:01:25,570 --> 02:01:29,140
I don't like being naked in warm water
bro. Like it's super exotic to me.

2105
02:01:29,141 --> 02:01:32,580
She choke off before you go in there.
So you're not attempted does it?

2106
02:01:32,650 --> 02:01:36,760
They'll song floating. Yeah. What
if you're just jack went off first,

2107
02:01:36,790 --> 02:01:39,470
then you'll be like, man, I
wish I was horny right now.

2108
02:01:40,490 --> 02:01:44,310
He came out and he goes like this.
He's like, I'm like, what? He goes,

2109
02:01:44,430 --> 02:01:46,640
how was your thing? I go, it was
good. It was actually really amazing.

2110
02:01:46,890 --> 02:01:50,330
Kind of felt myself floating and I
kind of, he goes here, I jacked off.

2111
02:01:52,090 --> 02:01:56,750
I was like, Hey, we don't ruin it. I
know what to do, what you do with it.

2112
02:01:56,751 --> 02:02:01,660
Cause I just fucking chat that day.
Shooting a heavier,

2113
02:02:02,130 --> 02:02:06,120
she going to jump places. Never get
with me back to go into my siblings.

2114
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:07,880
Docomo for skimmer.

2115
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:12,860
Well the salt kills everything
but gee whiz. Oh whatever.

2116
02:02:15,450 --> 02:02:18,820
I don't, I don't want, I
don't want dead. Come on.

2117
02:02:18,950 --> 02:02:22,430
And you can chose fucking tub bro.

2118
02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:26,000
Well crashed a one time thing.
Shout out to the float lab of Venice,

2119
02:02:26,001 --> 02:02:27,830
California and now Westwood,
they uh,

2120
02:02:27,831 --> 02:02:32,210
they have the best tanks and he's
about his fucking filtration systems.

2121
02:02:32,450 --> 02:02:37,040
He uses water filtration systems for
like, like, like you'd use for a city,

2122
02:02:38,590 --> 02:02:41,900
this giant fucking machines.
You should see the setup he put back here.

2123
02:02:42,050 --> 02:02:46,670
It's like Commercial Waterford back here,
back here. They keep purpose tub bro.

2124
02:02:46,760 --> 02:02:50,870
They keep everything out.
Yeah. And we film, we feel,

2125
02:02:50,871 --> 02:02:51,890
we feel that

2126
02:02:55,480 --> 02:03:00,170
it is a one fucking type
thing. I was in the warm water.

2127
02:03:00,260 --> 02:03:03,650
I don't want to be naked. I get
it. I get it. I get it. Look,

2128
02:03:03,690 --> 02:03:05,720
anytime someone says
I was beaten off I go,

2129
02:03:05,750 --> 02:03:10,670
I get it to judged like your mother.
I don't want to be judged.

2130
02:03:10,850 --> 02:03:15,570
I get it. Let me too. People are
Gross, especially men especially,

2131
02:03:16,140 --> 02:03:18,980
uh, any other fights that we
should talk about the wrap this up.

2132
02:03:23,900 --> 02:03:27,710
It's going to get another shot at.
He should. Huh? You know what I mean?

2133
02:03:27,711 --> 02:03:32,090
This is what we're thinking and people
thinking, you know, the guy fights,

2134
02:03:32,660 --> 02:03:33,080
um,

2135
02:03:33,080 --> 02:03:38,080
wins more UFC title defenses than anybody
in the history of the sport becomes.

2136
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:42,770
Uh, you know, the most accomplished
heavyweight of all time. I mean,

2137
02:03:42,771 --> 02:03:43,970
you think about what he's done.

2138
02:03:44,180 --> 02:03:46,700
Do you think about the fact that he
knocks out for BC over doomed to win the

2139
02:03:46,701 --> 02:03:49,370
title? He knocks out, asked
her over and defend the title,

2140
02:03:49,430 --> 02:03:54,380
knocks out Junior dos Santos stops beats
Francis when everybody's terrified of

2141
02:03:54,381 --> 02:03:58,340
Francis. I mean, he became
the most accomplished
heavyweight of all time. Right?

2142
02:03:58,580 --> 02:04:00,730
Then he gets knocked out
in the first round up.

2143
02:04:00,740 --> 02:04:05,540
Crazy perfect punch by Daniel Cormier
and a perfect strategy. He got to go.

2144
02:04:05,541 --> 02:04:09,800
Well, he, uh, for sure
I'd like to see a rematch.

2145
02:04:10,250 --> 02:04:10,611
It's like,

2146
02:04:10,611 --> 02:04:13,640
when do you want to see them beat
somebody first and then have a rematch?

2147
02:04:13,670 --> 02:04:16,560
I actually want to see,
but for me, Dan called me.

2148
02:04:16,561 --> 02:04:20,150
I've always said it is the most impressive
fighter to ever step in the octagon

2149
02:04:20,151 --> 02:04:22,900
in terms of his stature. I just
think he's incredible. Right?

2150
02:04:22,910 --> 02:04:26,810
He said to me the best,
I want to see him fight Jon Jones.

2151
02:04:26,830 --> 02:04:31,570
I know that John John's, they say,
well, the big money versus Brock,

2152
02:04:31,571 --> 02:04:32,990
that all he's waiting.
Okay,

2153
02:04:33,050 --> 02:04:35,740
so even with Alexander guts when
all this tool five talk, he's like,

2154
02:04:35,940 --> 02:04:39,780
you'll run mail. He's like,
well, that's not happening.
Yeah, I'm retiring in March,

2155
02:04:39,860 --> 02:04:40,950
Brock,
we ready to go.

2156
02:04:41,060 --> 02:04:45,600
Can you January person just asked for a
title shot now after he just beat Glover

2157
02:04:46,050 --> 02:04:48,840
and so you know, he said
something like, Hey, you know,

2158
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:52,470
like I love the U of C's can be as Brock.

2159
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:56,940
The fight is broad questions.
The narrative guys, Ken Brock,

2160
02:04:56,941 --> 02:05:01,410
pass tests. Look at me. Yeah, yeah.

2161
02:05:01,710 --> 02:05:05,020
You know,
how long do you need to go to last?

2162
02:05:06,360 --> 02:05:08,430
How long do you need before?
It's like the answer's never.

2163
02:05:08,431 --> 02:05:13,431
Brian Gustafson opens up on crazy
situation taking him off UFC two 27 years.

2164
02:05:14,340 --> 02:05:17,790
Well, what's, what happens, small
injuries say we'll talk about it. Oh,

2165
02:05:17,820 --> 02:05:21,210
he won't talk about it then
how is he opening up? Kit
will cause people are like,

2166
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:24,620
oh you won't find Anthony Smith but you'll
fight DC or you'll find a heavyweight,

2167
02:05:24,630 --> 02:05:27,030
but now all of a sudden
you're injured and they fight.

2168
02:05:27,150 --> 02:05:30,480
Anthony Smith versus Shogun was a
fight that I was concerned about.

2169
02:05:30,780 --> 02:05:34,400
I thought shogun retired. Yeah.
However he won three in a row.

2170
02:05:34,401 --> 02:05:37,890
Few would have one that I wanted to see
him get a tough shot against DC cause I

2171
02:05:37,891 --> 02:05:40,680
went DC to get paid.
Well Shogun is,

2172
02:05:40,890 --> 02:05:44,340
he was ranked I think eighth,
eight or seven for this fight.

2173
02:05:44,580 --> 02:05:47,160
But even though he's not that old.
How old is Shogun?

2174
02:05:47,500 --> 02:05:51,410
Let's say you're 34 old though.
How old corridors and fight words?

2175
02:05:52,530 --> 02:05:56,850
He's just fucking Brazilian towards
the unibrow. How old is showing up?

2176
02:05:57,520 --> 02:06:00,420
I think he's like 36
right? He's my age. Izzy,

2177
02:06:01,530 --> 02:06:05,440
36 year old or even though he's
36 like look when Bernard Hopkins,

2178
02:06:05,441 --> 02:06:09,100
who 36 is when he knocked out
Tito Tryna dog. He's in his prime.

2179
02:06:09,480 --> 02:06:10,920
When he beat Kelly Pavlock he was,

2180
02:06:10,921 --> 02:06:15,070
I think he was close to
49 had been 42 and yeah,

2181
02:06:15,450 --> 02:06:19,590
so that's not a Kelly paddocks
killer. Yeah. Not for everybody.

2182
02:06:19,591 --> 02:06:21,270
It doesn't mean that
they're past their prime,

2183
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:25,330
but shogun had been in so many wars and
he got knocked out by Dan Henderson and

2184
02:06:25,331 --> 02:06:27,330
the mainstay and brother and is different.

2185
02:06:27,331 --> 02:06:31,890
In 19 came on the Grand Prix
price days too. It was different.

2186
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:34,850
Different world, different
world, the drugs and price.

2187
02:06:35,210 --> 02:06:38,760
And now we got the grant snitch. It's
such a different environment. Yeah, man.

2188
02:06:38,761 --> 02:06:42,120
But you'd never know who was doing what
back then when they were went there for

2189
02:06:42,130 --> 02:06:45,750
a mother. Fuck his mother.
He's a talent fucker.

2190
02:06:45,780 --> 02:06:48,660
Let's not just propel him
to fight Gus if, no, no, no,

2191
02:06:48,661 --> 02:06:52,440
no dude let but meet him while he was
ready. He was ready. He wanted to fight.

2192
02:06:52,490 --> 02:06:54,390
He looking.
Here's the argument for it.

2193
02:06:54,510 --> 02:06:57,930
The argument for it is he knocks
out Rashad on short notice.

2194
02:06:57,960 --> 02:07:01,650
He knocks out shogun and then he'll
say, look, I'll take this fight to,

2195
02:07:01,770 --> 02:07:05,800
that guy's rolling and he's a veteran.
He's got momentum. You don't know.

2196
02:07:05,810 --> 02:07:08,160
Fight the fight.
The most intriguing fight to me would be,

2197
02:07:08,730 --> 02:07:13,380
I mean it's not Brock and I liked that.
I liked PROC DC because DC gets paid,

2198
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:16,290
but to me the only reason,
but the,

2199
02:07:16,620 --> 02:07:20,640
the most intriguing fight to me and a
lot of ways would be y'all out Romero at

2200
02:07:20,641 --> 02:07:24,690
two oh five and dealt with that weight
cut with Daniel Cormier as well.

2201
02:07:24,710 --> 02:07:29,230
Cormier was like, Nah, Nah, you can't
lose at this fight and you miss wait,

2202
02:07:29,290 --> 02:07:33,960
go. Yeah, sure. And you Ms. Wade
smart. But then Yo like listen DC,

2203
02:07:34,030 --> 02:07:36,220
you cheated when you made,
you know you're pushing

2204
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:40,680
down that towel that one time. Okay,
that one time, that one time. Those real,

2205
02:07:40,700 --> 02:07:44,800
do we want to talk about cheating and
for ELL to DC? What are you saying?

2206
02:07:45,390 --> 02:07:47,610
Dual gate. Oh, still get,
here's the difference.

2207
02:07:47,611 --> 02:07:50,640
You fuck my boy Tim over the coaches.
You're saying the coaches,

2208
02:07:50,680 --> 02:07:54,130
John McCarthy said it totally different
when John McCarthy explained it to me

2209
02:07:54,160 --> 02:07:57,610
and I, I think he explained it to me
off the air. This is what was wrong.

2210
02:07:58,180 --> 02:08:03,180
The guy who put too much Vaseline
on on Yo el was not in his corner.

2211
02:08:05,890 --> 02:08:10,890
The guy was a UFC employee and he wasn't
coming back in and John was trying to

2212
02:08:11,231 --> 02:08:14,890
get them to come back in and he didn't
come back in and Yo al sat down on the

2213
02:08:14,891 --> 02:08:17,740
chair and he said if you had to do things
differently you would have done things

2214
02:08:17,741 --> 02:08:19,690
much differently. It would have
forced them off the chair now.

2215
02:08:19,690 --> 02:08:22,090
But he said this clusterfuck
could happen over 30 seconds.

2216
02:08:22,091 --> 02:08:26,500
Was is not because of Yo L's corner
cause because of the UFC employee.

2217
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:30,350
Take back what I said, if, if John
says that what John says his word,

2218
02:08:30,380 --> 02:08:32,570
it's where I will not argue
with John McCarthy effort.

2219
02:08:32,590 --> 02:08:36,370
He explained it to me in no uncertain
terms. He said, but this man, he goes,

2220
02:08:36,371 --> 02:08:37,960
I feel like he got away with something.

2221
02:08:38,110 --> 02:08:42,310
He goes in and an ever every fight after
that I watched him like a hawk. He goes,

2222
02:08:42,311 --> 02:08:45,070
I felt like he got away with something
and that's like Tim over no matter what

2223
02:08:45,071 --> 02:08:48,420
the state on his stool, he did stay on
a stool. I mean there was no though.

2224
02:08:48,570 --> 02:08:50,640
If no one's getting this
too. I'm like, I'm chilling.

2225
02:08:50,690 --> 02:08:54,660
It was 30 seconds is is his significance.

2226
02:08:56,070 --> 02:08:59,840
It's huge. But then he had
a good, he had a good point.

2227
02:08:59,870 --> 02:09:04,030
I could everything that Tim,
Tim at one point was holding his wrist.

2228
02:09:04,150 --> 02:09:06,240
He had cuffed his glove.
He was holding his, well,

2229
02:09:06,250 --> 02:09:07,850
it happens in any industry fight,
right?

2230
02:09:08,050 --> 02:09:10,210
He hit him with a punch and that
was the punch that heard him. Yes.

2231
02:09:10,330 --> 02:09:13,570
So he has an argument. You're
right. It happens in every fight,

2232
02:09:13,571 --> 02:09:16,390
but it's not supposed to happen. Right.
It's not something you're supposed to do.

2233
02:09:16,600 --> 02:09:21,400
Now. Tim was in full barbaric
rage when this was happening.

2234
02:09:21,401 --> 02:09:24,660
When he's throwing his punches,
he recognized that he was grabbing,

2235
02:09:24,661 --> 02:09:26,770
he's fucking throwing bombs.
Who knows? What was that?

2236
02:09:26,771 --> 02:09:29,740
He's fighting with the most athletic
guy for sure. He's ever fought. I mean,

2237
02:09:29,741 --> 02:09:32,770
he was in a bad state in that fight.
I mean that was a like,

2238
02:09:32,950 --> 02:09:37,190
doesn't have like one to fighting
a guy. Jesus had one. Yeah.

2239
02:09:37,570 --> 02:09:41,710
Yo Man. Such a freak,
freak, freak, super freak.

2240
02:09:41,710 --> 02:09:44,860
Kelce Anderson twice in world champ. I
mean, he's super fruit. You're talking,

2241
02:09:45,990 --> 02:09:50,710
he's a freaking out. When I could find
all due respect. No, not a chance. Robert,

2242
02:09:50,711 --> 02:09:52,500
how dare you? I think you
went too. It'd be a draw.

2243
02:09:53,270 --> 02:09:56,500
Draw ten eight rounds if
you looked at it overall,

2244
02:09:57,250 --> 02:10:01,290
if he won two rounds, ten eight is
it a draw? Brian doesn't yell. Oh,

2245
02:10:01,360 --> 02:10:04,660
what were we saying round? He won
two rounds. Ten eight no, no, no.

2246
02:10:04,670 --> 02:10:07,690
Those round one round. One round tenants.
But it could be a draw at the end.

2247
02:10:07,691 --> 02:10:11,290
Both of those rounds, right? Yeah. But
one was like 10 when I'm like, damn,

2248
02:10:11,291 --> 02:10:14,440
it's ten eight so that'd be a drawing for
sure. But he didn't get it even in one,

2249
02:10:14,710 --> 02:10:16,670
which is what does an art,
that's a different guy.

2250
02:10:16,690 --> 02:10:21,160
It in two because in two rounds he had a
badly hurt. One was awful. Tone was off.

2251
02:10:21,240 --> 02:10:23,590
Eventually we'll talk tonight.
So let's say you give the one tonight.

2252
02:10:23,620 --> 02:10:27,080
So let's say it's a draw. Whatever Robert
work or the first one beat him, right?

2253
02:10:27,350 --> 02:10:28,090
Yes.

2254
02:10:28,090 --> 02:10:32,980
He did it with one leg and then this one
he'd beat him with one arm occur. No,

2255
02:10:33,320 --> 02:10:37,040
he broke his hand first.
That's right.

2256
02:10:37,070 --> 02:10:41,580
Straight up beast credible. One
leg. You're right. You're right.

2257
02:10:42,120 --> 02:10:46,900
That's a good vibe. Based on that
climbing on his jaw, you know,

2258
02:10:46,970 --> 02:10:49,670
Yo, I'll hit him with some
bombs. I don't have a problem.

2259
02:10:49,671 --> 02:10:51,730
Give them the ten eight on that guy's.
The fourth round.

2260
02:10:51,731 --> 02:10:52,820
Four thing was the fourth round

2261
02:10:55,070 --> 02:10:56,960
is a beast and still getting better.

2262
02:10:56,961 --> 02:11:01,400
Whitaker is only 26 here's
the problem though. He gets
injured all the time. Well,

2263
02:11:01,401 --> 02:11:05,800
who was he fighting? He's fighting
a brick wall. A brick wall twice.

2264
02:11:05,801 --> 02:11:08,360
Literally a brick wall. But the
problem is, is fighting so he can't,

2265
02:11:08,390 --> 02:11:09,410
you know what I'm saying?

2266
02:11:09,410 --> 02:11:11,720
So when you're going through
that rehabbing of broken bones,

2267
02:11:11,721 --> 02:11:14,960
you're not getting that much
better than between. Yes,

2268
02:11:14,990 --> 02:11:19,310
but it's entirely possible that with
a broken hand, he can work his kicks.

2269
02:11:19,311 --> 02:11:22,400
He could work a lot of different
things for sure. With a broken hand,

2270
02:11:22,401 --> 02:11:24,320
he's not going to have the same
issues that he had with a knee.

2271
02:11:24,410 --> 02:11:26,510
See what the knee you're,
you got mobility compromises.

2272
02:11:26,520 --> 02:11:29,330
You have a real hard time to train,
not train it with his hand.

2273
02:11:29,331 --> 02:11:34,010
He can do a lot of shit for sure. Yeah,
he's young and he could still, I mean,

2274
02:11:34,011 --> 02:11:36,410
look what he's doing in the fight. He
was throwing combinations with the left.

2275
02:11:36,420 --> 02:11:39,740
He was kicks. No, his kicks are
phenomenal. You all you want to fuck up?

2276
02:11:39,741 --> 02:11:40,574
I knew with this kid

2277
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,650
fucked his knees and he fucked his
knees up really early in the fight.

2278
02:11:45,650 --> 02:11:46,670
Like right from the jump.

2279
02:11:46,671 --> 02:11:49,610
He was using that oblique kick
on the front leg side kick.

2280
02:11:49,611 --> 02:11:54,180
I got you oversee the
pos or Bonacina but Gina,

2281
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:59,060
I would never wear those. If I had
a buddy lag then yeah, it cost,

2282
02:11:59,090 --> 02:12:03,380
they got mad at my boy, Kelly Slater.
Oh, why? Because Kelly was like, he,

2283
02:12:03,400 --> 02:12:07,730
I don't think you've passed the
sniff test. Oh, you mean as Kelly?

2284
02:12:07,790 --> 02:12:12,140
I mean the chances for a rematch for
that Whittaker and and Steven Thompson.

2285
02:12:12,410 --> 02:12:16,620
Well with Stephen Thompson
just lost till. So, um,

2286
02:12:16,670 --> 02:12:18,800
unless Stephen Thompson goes up to one 85,

2287
02:12:18,830 --> 02:12:23,030
I don't think it's going to happen
because Stephen Thompson is at one 70 and

2288
02:12:23,510 --> 02:12:24,260
could do it.

2289
02:12:24,260 --> 02:12:28,430
He could go up to one 85 in short though
the queue at welterweights a nightmare.

2290
02:12:28,431 --> 02:12:31,700
So if he wanted to get quick title shot,
he didn't that one on one.

2291
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:34,910
He did knock rubber to cut her out. But
I think you can achieve with that. Yeah.

2292
02:12:35,070 --> 02:12:38,150
And you think you attribute some of
that to the brutal wait, cut. You know,

2293
02:12:38,180 --> 02:12:40,070
we're seeing these guys that are,

2294
02:12:40,100 --> 02:12:44,260
they're just taking so much out of
their body to get to one 70 this is why

2295
02:12:44,261 --> 02:12:48,140
people get so fucking angry when someone
misses weight by a couple of pounds and

2296
02:12:48,141 --> 02:12:50,490
still fights like Derek till.
So see,

2297
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:53,000
here's the argument against Darren
till fighting for the title.

2298
02:12:53,210 --> 02:12:57,380
He Wa he beat Stephen Wonderboy.
But how many pounds over was he a lot?

2299
02:12:57,770 --> 02:13:02,150
It was more than two write way more. Yeah,
it was a six. It's criminal. It's a lot.

2300
02:13:02,420 --> 02:13:04,430
I don't think it was that much,
but it was a lot of weight.

2301
02:13:04,460 --> 02:13:05,660
It was more than two pounds.

2302
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:08,090
That is a lot of weight to lose
when you already dried out.

2303
02:13:08,091 --> 02:13:12,290
And he's an enormous welter weight. So
the argument and she argument should be,

2304
02:13:12,380 --> 02:13:16,460
if we're in a fair world,
if you do not make weight and you win,

2305
02:13:16,670 --> 02:13:19,880
you cannot fight for the title
next, the problem. Right.

2306
02:13:20,090 --> 02:13:23,270
The problem with that is financially
that sucks because I want these guys to

2307
02:13:23,271 --> 02:13:27,440
fight. Sure. Right? And as a fan, it
sucks because I want these guys to fight.

2308
02:13:27,530 --> 02:13:30,830
But from the perspective of the
athletes, you've got to think like, man,

2309
02:13:31,010 --> 02:13:33,960
and so this brings me back
to my original premise.

2310
02:13:34,140 --> 02:13:35,790
I don't think they should
be able to cut weight.

2311
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:39,420
I think what they're doing at one
fc and what Ben askern detailed,

2312
02:13:39,421 --> 02:13:43,590
how they monitored his weight cuts
move everybody's championship up await.

2313
02:13:43,710 --> 02:13:46,550
You keep the same champions.
You find out what fucking wait,

2314
02:13:46,551 --> 02:13:50,220
is that the right weight for them?
There was an idea if a sky 70 nope,

2315
02:13:50,221 --> 02:13:53,010
your real weight is one 85
if the guys want 85 people,

2316
02:13:53,011 --> 02:13:56,070
we would still people with Stella.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2317
02:13:56,100 --> 02:13:59,490
They don't allow them to, they do
hydration test through their entire camp.

2318
02:13:59,730 --> 02:14:01,080
They checked him multiple times.

2319
02:14:01,081 --> 02:14:03,990
They find out exactly what they way
they find out what they really way plus

2320
02:14:03,991 --> 02:14:07,150
hydration test. Yes. They're not
cutting weight. That makes sense.

2321
02:14:08,740 --> 02:14:10,310
They go up,
you go up a weight class,

2322
02:14:10,350 --> 02:14:14,190
everyone just goes and astro went up to
one 85 he was fighting at one 70 before,

2323
02:14:14,191 --> 02:14:16,440
I think. Find that. Make,
make sure that's correct.

2324
02:14:16,441 --> 02:14:19,620
I know your body better for your career.
100% better.

2325
02:14:19,621 --> 02:14:23,370
He was one 17 but I believe they
made him go to give it a title,

2326
02:14:23,390 --> 02:14:26,010
but he kept his title.
So you don't strip the championships.

2327
02:14:26,160 --> 02:14:30,630
He just moved the champions up 100% and
I think they should establish additional

2328
02:14:30,631 --> 02:14:35,490
weight classes. So what does it say
here? Um, result, event day. Okay.

2329
02:14:35,730 --> 02:14:39,450
We will allow our athletes to come.
We will not allow our athletes to compete,

2330
02:14:39,451 --> 02:14:42,720
compete, dehydrated. Rich find said
powerful rich Franklin Franklin.

2331
02:14:43,080 --> 02:14:46,350
But if they happen to be overweight,
if they're hydrated,

2332
02:14:46,351 --> 02:14:48,240
but maybe half a pound over,
something like that,

2333
02:14:48,241 --> 02:14:50,910
we can negotiate a catch weight
and we have parameters for that.

2334
02:14:50,911 --> 02:14:55,530
We have to police to 105% of
their opponent's weight. Oh,

2335
02:14:55,531 --> 02:14:57,690
they have to be at least a hundred
per 5% of their opponent's weight,

2336
02:14:57,691 --> 02:15:01,020
so they can't be more than 5% over is
what he's saying. Damn. It's really smart.

2337
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:02,970
Ingenious.

2338
02:15:02,970 --> 02:15:06,360
He said we use an instrument to test to
Pacific specific gravity of their urine,

2339
02:15:06,480 --> 02:15:10,110
which test, how much saw utes
are in their urine. He continued.

2340
02:15:10,111 --> 02:15:14,460
Obviously the more solid roots you have,
the more dehydrated you are.

2341
02:15:14,461 --> 02:15:18,990
So they have dehydration tests are the
established at a fighter is performing at

2342
02:15:18,991 --> 02:15:21,000
a healthy weight.
They weigh in at that weight.

2343
02:15:21,090 --> 02:15:23,730
They're weighing in it that way at a more
than one occasion. They're checking it.

2344
02:15:23,730 --> 02:15:25,750
It should be easier. In fact, he just,

2345
02:15:26,330 --> 02:15:29,910
he knows a lot about this tee shirt does.
He was enormous.

2346
02:15:30,210 --> 02:15:34,080
He was in [inaudible] 85 he was an
enormous one 85 when he was the champ.

2347
02:15:34,220 --> 02:15:37,020
He was so much bigger than like David
[inaudible] and a lot of the guys,

2348
02:15:37,430 --> 02:15:41,310
he knows a lot about wake up and he
was a fitness phenomenon. Math teacher.

2349
02:15:41,340 --> 02:15:45,840
He was like one of the guys that was
one of the first super fucking condition

2350
02:15:45,841 --> 02:15:50,670
guys who just break guys with his
pace and his will and his discipline.

2351
02:15:50,790 --> 02:15:52,800
He's a beast.
Rich Franklin does get enough credit.

2352
02:15:52,801 --> 02:15:55,260
He was an ass and cause we see
because we remember him from,

2353
02:15:55,290 --> 02:15:59,970
from the Dave Anderson Bites, really God
verse Franklin Minis. For most of us,

2354
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:03,890
most of us are heard about him when, when
we saw him just have to deal with that,

2355
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:06,160
that the best of all solvable problem.

2356
02:16:06,200 --> 02:16:09,870
But when Anderson Anderson back then,

2357
02:16:09,871 --> 02:16:12,530
his body though was this,

2358
02:16:13,320 --> 02:16:16,350
when he fought Anderson
at that point in time,

2359
02:16:16,380 --> 02:16:21,090
Anderson was the best of all. He was
a Ninja and they were like, rich,

2360
02:16:21,091 --> 02:16:24,090
we need you to financial against.
You need to do it again.

2361
02:16:24,091 --> 02:16:25,920
But we are doing since standing in
front of all your friends and family

2362
02:16:27,350 --> 02:16:32,300
[inaudible] he couldn't get out his nose.
Yeah,

2363
02:16:32,470 --> 02:16:34,040
rich Franklin's without time greats.

2364
02:16:34,300 --> 02:16:37,190
He's an all time because one
of the reasons I got into
it, but you know, Brown,

2365
02:16:37,191 --> 02:16:40,990
he didn't, he had a different strategy.
His strategy was to be super strong,

2366
02:16:40,991 --> 02:16:44,320
super condition. Very highly skilled,
but not at the same level of Anderson.

2367
02:16:44,590 --> 02:16:49,180
Anderson's thing was all
technical Anderson was all
about technique and footwork

2368
02:16:49,181 --> 02:16:52,680
and movement and he, that
trumps everything. It really
does. Nerd. I was like,

2369
02:16:52,690 --> 02:16:56,620
I tag us a Alva telling me that said,
he's like the dude. I was like, what?

2370
02:16:56,621 --> 02:16:57,910
Because you knew him really well.
Like what's it like?

2371
02:16:58,200 --> 02:17:02,500
He was a martial arts nerve martial
art nerd. He would like practice.

2372
02:17:02,620 --> 02:17:05,590
Remember that one weird thing where he
did his elbow up and when you freak out,

2373
02:17:05,630 --> 02:17:08,030
he'd not proud Tony for that.
Apparently according to Jack,

2374
02:17:08,040 --> 02:17:10,330
he had been practicing that. He
was always doing this like, well,

2375
02:17:10,331 --> 02:17:14,020
I wonder if this work. I mean, he's just
really Chris in this worse than this. His,

2376
02:17:14,080 --> 02:17:17,440
his fucking trainer told him to stop
doing it because it's not going to work.

2377
02:17:17,441 --> 02:17:20,400
Right. So he makes his wife hold
a pillow for him, so he goes home,

2378
02:17:20,430 --> 02:17:23,170
he's fucking blast in the
pillow with this upward elbow.

2379
02:17:23,530 --> 02:17:26,230
He does it over and over again and it
pulls it off in the fight and knock them

2380
02:17:26,231 --> 02:17:29,720
dead with it. It's a crazy scene. Yeah.

2381
02:17:29,920 --> 02:17:34,120
You ever see his fight with Lee Marie
and cage warriors now? Holy Shit.

2382
02:17:34,420 --> 02:17:37,510
Holy Shit.
He was going to retire to big nog domes.

2383
02:17:37,511 --> 02:17:42,180
Like you can't stop coming to the UFC. He
was catching his stride in England. See,

2384
02:17:42,190 --> 02:17:45,580
he fought very well in Japan, but then
really came into his own in England.

2385
02:17:45,700 --> 02:17:49,380
He fought Jorge Rivera. Do you remember
Jorge Rivera? He fought Jorge Rivera.

2386
02:17:49,420 --> 02:17:50,940
Jorge was teeing off on him.
Yeah.

2387
02:17:51,010 --> 02:17:53,980
He was letting Jorge punched him in the
face and then he fucked him up. Yup.

2388
02:17:54,010 --> 02:17:55,840
It was one of the scariest
fights I've ever seen him. Like,

2389
02:17:55,841 --> 02:17:58,030
I dunno what the fuck
he was doing back then,

2390
02:17:58,180 --> 02:18:03,100
but Anderson was on another guide,
wasn't like this crazy super.

2391
02:18:03,101 --> 02:18:06,250
He was, not that he was
retired. He was always skillful,

2392
02:18:06,990 --> 02:18:08,760
but it was never like crazy.

2393
02:18:09,520 --> 02:18:13,150
I was watching him fight from the fights
that I was watching from England, so I,

2394
02:18:13,450 --> 02:18:17,710
I would, you know, as a hardcore
fan, especially back then,

2395
02:18:17,711 --> 02:18:20,830
I knew that there was a lot of talent
that I wasn't seeing in the UFC when I was

2396
02:18:20,831 --> 02:18:21,580
working for the UFC.

2397
02:18:21,580 --> 02:18:25,240
So I was actively like trying to seek
out all the guys that people that would

2398
02:18:25,241 --> 02:18:28,360
hear about, and I remember watching some
of the Andersons fights, I was like, oh,

2399
02:18:28,361 --> 02:18:31,060
this guy's hit a new place
because you guys do that man,

2400
02:18:31,240 --> 02:18:33,460
you'll see a fighter and they're
really good. They're really good,

2401
02:18:33,461 --> 02:18:36,340
they're really good. And then all of
a sudden, boom, they hit that girl.

2402
02:18:36,341 --> 02:18:37,101
And if that,
some of that,

2403
02:18:37,101 --> 02:18:41,800
it's like sometimes there are certain
pockets of coaching that seemed like a New

2404
02:18:41,800 --> 02:18:44,270
Zealand New Zealand has high level strike,

2405
02:18:44,590 --> 02:18:48,670
I'll for sure with style bender and
with a, and even the doctor, right?

2406
02:18:48,671 --> 02:18:51,130
I mean Dan Hooker, like here's,
here's him versus what? Watch this.

2407
02:18:51,340 --> 02:18:53,890
He's like letting him hit him. Look
at this, he's holding onto him,

2408
02:18:53,960 --> 02:18:57,730
Jorge's hitting him and hitting up
look it up. Boom. And he's like, bitch,

2409
02:18:58,390 --> 02:19:01,470
this is not happening. You Ain't hurting
me. He's standing right in front of them.

2410
02:19:01,530 --> 02:19:04,420
I mean literally little let him punch him
in the face and just rolled with them.

2411
02:19:04,630 --> 02:19:07,030
Then how about when it comes to the
UFC, they're like, Hey Chris, leaving,

2412
02:19:07,050 --> 02:19:10,120
fight this Brazilian like what?

2413
02:19:10,450 --> 02:19:14,980
But it's crazy how calm he was while
Jorge was knocking people out, man,

2414
02:19:15,070 --> 02:19:18,960
that he has big power.
The fact that his and was so skillful,

2415
02:19:18,990 --> 02:19:23,440
he was really able to just turn his face
just slightly to standing and move with

2416
02:19:23,441 --> 02:19:27,040
those punches just enough to take the
pop off of them and completely ruined

2417
02:19:27,140 --> 02:19:29,600
confidence. And then he just
starts putting it on a man.

2418
02:19:29,660 --> 02:19:31,550
He just started putting
it on Prime Anderson.

2419
02:19:31,551 --> 02:19:34,550
You remember how electricity
was coming to the octagon? This,

2420
02:19:34,551 --> 02:19:36,500
this was a fight that really
turned it around from me.

2421
02:19:36,501 --> 02:19:39,110
This isn't the Lee Marie fight. There
were two fights where I was like, okay,

2422
02:19:39,111 --> 02:19:41,360
he's in a different place right now.
You know?

2423
02:19:41,361 --> 02:19:46,361
He just was so fucking talented and so
good at judging distance and figuring out

2424
02:19:47,571 --> 02:19:49,130
what to do and when to do it.

2425
02:19:49,370 --> 02:19:51,590
And he fought when he fought
Demian Maia and Abu Dhabi.

2426
02:19:51,800 --> 02:19:53,810
It was a boring ass [inaudible] fuck this.

2427
02:19:53,870 --> 02:19:57,590
But there was something in the first
round that he did where I was like, wait,

2428
02:19:57,591 --> 02:19:58,340
what?

2429
02:19:58,340 --> 02:20:03,340
He leaped and he hit Damien Maia with a
flying knee from about four or five feet

2430
02:20:04,730 --> 02:20:08,120
further away than I thought was possible.
Dude, I will. I will never forget.

2431
02:20:08,180 --> 02:20:12,170
I will launched himself
and it looked,

2432
02:20:12,171 --> 02:20:15,050
it didn't look like it was much effort.
Nothing went when he knocked out,

2433
02:20:15,410 --> 02:20:17,120
vetoed that fucking front kick man.

2434
02:20:18,170 --> 02:20:21,830
First time we were like kind of slung
get fucking starts from that main event.

2435
02:20:22,130 --> 02:20:24,560
I remember I was sitting
basically Kate's I,

2436
02:20:24,570 --> 02:20:27,800
my manager Lex with me and he has bad
eyes, basically blind. He can't see.

2437
02:20:27,801 --> 02:20:30,230
I was dying and it happens.
I go,

2438
02:20:30,440 --> 02:20:34,010
that's the craziest thing I've ever
seen in sports. It was what happened.

2439
02:20:34,450 --> 02:20:39,440
I know what you fucking misdiagnosis.
I didn't see it.

2440
02:20:39,470 --> 02:20:42,650
I didn't see. I'm like, I should
not be here. I love that dude.

2441
02:20:42,651 --> 02:20:46,910
You wasted this fucking ticket lakes. I
remember shut up. I remember screaming.

2442
02:20:46,911 --> 02:20:49,490
He fucked, kicked him in
the face. That was the,

2443
02:20:49,560 --> 02:20:52,220
that's the best sporting
event live I've ever seen.

2444
02:20:52,250 --> 02:20:55,400
When Anderson Silva kick fucking crazy.

2445
02:20:55,460 --> 02:21:00,170
It was just this stock and it was also
one of those fights where you didn't know

2446
02:21:00,171 --> 02:21:01,980
who the fuck was going to win that fight,
that fight.

2447
02:21:01,990 --> 02:21:06,840
Remembering what beat toward that was too.
That was pretty jacked up. He tour? No,

2448
02:21:06,870 --> 02:21:10,430
no, no. It was it between now
bodied up the way he was after.

2449
02:21:10,431 --> 02:21:14,210
It was like super easy. What
he looked like. Well he wasn't,

2450
02:21:16,030 --> 02:21:19,290
it wasn't Dan, but look at it. Look
at his body is nowhere near the veto.

2451
02:21:19,310 --> 02:21:23,600
That Rockhold fight. Dude. He looks
pretty good. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2452
02:21:23,601 --> 02:21:25,310
Watch the fight back it up a little bit.

2453
02:21:25,510 --> 02:21:29,660
Why watch them actually move around
before the knockout. That's all it is. No,

2454
02:21:29,661 --> 02:21:31,940
he wasn't. He was in bed.
Go to the way and he,

2455
02:21:32,360 --> 02:21:36,110
I remember very specifically that was
the same look that he had when he fought

2456
02:21:36,111 --> 02:21:38,960
like Takiyama or sexy young for sure,

2457
02:21:38,961 --> 02:21:43,961
which wasn't terrible was it was in
comparison to how he looked when he fought

2458
02:21:44,451 --> 02:21:48,780
Bisping. Look, there's the team.
We'll kick. Yeah, we'll give you,

2459
02:21:48,781 --> 02:21:53,090
Vito was a different detour. It's what is
this? Which one's, this Si very smooth.

2460
02:21:53,270 --> 02:21:57,170
This is not, he doesn't look anything
like TRT v two look at his neck.

2461
02:21:57,320 --> 02:21:58,970
Look at his body traps
are a little smaller.

2462
02:21:59,240 --> 02:22:03,310
Obviously he's still about 1400 grams.
Not even close to Jack though, right?

2463
02:22:03,330 --> 02:22:07,370
I mean he's in very good shape. Don't get
me wrong, but when he's not in TV tour,

2464
02:22:07,700 --> 02:22:11,420
you know who'd be DRTV tried his
prime hook. Jon Jones. Yes he did.

2465
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:15,080
But Jon Jones is enormous.
So, oh look at this

2466
02:22:16,620 --> 02:22:19,130
thing with the hands.
Look at Anderson.

2467
02:22:19,640 --> 02:22:21,430
Anderson was doing like
wing Chung on him and shit.

2468
02:22:21,431 --> 02:22:24,410
I remember people were booing cause you
guys were just move around and were like,

2469
02:22:24,411 --> 02:22:25,650
come on,
let's do something then

2470
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:29,490
hit cow. He's looking for the move,
man. He's looking for that opening.

2471
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:33,120
He's looking for that opening
and he's smiling, smiling.

2472
02:22:33,260 --> 02:22:34,590
Look at watch them and look down too.

2473
02:22:34,591 --> 02:22:37,530
That's the other thing he did that old
move that guys would look down at your

2474
02:22:37,531 --> 02:22:40,890
feet and kicking the head was actually
six two or six. Three we think. Six.

2475
02:22:40,891 --> 02:22:44,850
Three I believe. Three tall. Yeah.
He almost got starched here. Two men.

2476
02:22:44,851 --> 02:22:47,340
Vito was throwing some fucking haymakers.
You're there on the ground.

2477
02:22:47,860 --> 02:22:52,080
He tours a monster, a monster.
See This v Tours, very fit,

2478
02:22:52,081 --> 02:22:55,320
very good in shape.
Veto, but not TRT v tour.

2479
02:22:55,410 --> 02:22:58,200
Once they gave him the green light and
then you'd have to worry about testing.

2480
02:22:58,470 --> 02:23:03,030
He was like, he put a thousand
horsepower engine in a Volkswagen,

2481
02:23:03,031 --> 02:23:06,250
drove off a cliff.
Let's do this.

2482
02:23:06,510 --> 02:23:11,250
Oh my God, whoa on Sun.
Came out of nowhere.

2483
02:23:11,730 --> 02:23:15,390
Then one to them. Look at that again.
Watch this. They did not need the one too,

2484
02:23:15,391 --> 02:23:19,250
but yeah, look how he's looking at his
chest too. Yeah. Toad deceptive. Yup.

2485
02:23:19,350 --> 02:23:20,760
He looked at his chest in front,

2486
02:23:20,761 --> 02:23:23,370
kicked him in the Chin and that was
literally the first time we'd ever seen a

2487
02:23:23,371 --> 02:23:25,260
front kick to the face.
All dropping.

2488
02:23:25,290 --> 02:23:29,060
There's only two moments that made my
jaw drop that Anthony Pettis German.

2489
02:23:29,070 --> 02:23:30,000
Remember when the Oda,

2490
02:23:30,001 --> 02:23:33,150
but cheated did the same thing to Randy
coture but he ended with a jumping front

2491
02:23:33,151 --> 02:23:33,984
knock his teeth.

2492
02:23:34,950 --> 02:23:38,760
Kid Karate kid is disrespectful and then,

2493
02:23:42,660 --> 02:23:45,950
and then Leo did it to fucking vittores
like this is your last full around.

2494
02:23:46,310 --> 02:23:50,280
This is why. Let me show you
something. Look at this same shit.

2495
02:23:50,281 --> 02:23:54,270
He's doing the fucking og.
That crazy little fact for you.

2496
02:23:54,330 --> 02:23:57,540
I got a look at that brand new.
We're ready for this fight.

2497
02:23:57,540 --> 02:24:01,980
The night before I told myths and Mimic
Leo Machida. One thing I didn't mimic.

2498
02:24:02,240 --> 02:24:07,140
Fucking God. Yeah, that was
the, Oh, is this too fast thing?

2499
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:12,150
He kick his fucking too disrespectful.
That is. They know and I said,

2500
02:24:12,180 --> 02:24:15,600
Holy Shit. I go that he kicked a suit at
Dana goes, we'll buy him some more teeth.

2501
02:24:15,850 --> 02:24:18,930
And I said, dude, he's Randy. Go to her.
I want some shit with diamonds in it.

2502
02:24:19,630 --> 02:24:22,300
Get him some with diamonds. Awful. Insane.

2503
02:24:24,210 --> 02:24:26,430
When he locked up v
toward this last fight,

2504
02:24:26,490 --> 02:24:29,010
that's the worst front kick you've
ever seen. What was perfect?

2505
02:24:29,011 --> 02:24:31,440
It's a walk off home run and
this is what's disrespectful.

2506
02:24:31,441 --> 02:24:34,970
I know he's being polite.
He goes sketches and fucking be towards,

2507
02:24:34,971 --> 02:24:37,710
just falls down and gets on
his knees and pray. Watch this.

2508
02:24:37,740 --> 02:24:41,090
But watch how perfect it is
to watch a quick boop. Oh,

2509
02:24:41,950 --> 02:24:45,060
see like stands over and
then, yeah, my brother.

2510
02:24:45,600 --> 02:24:48,270
Thank you for your time in the cage.
Yeah,

2511
02:24:48,480 --> 02:24:51,090
I'd rather you just walk off and
jump on the cage with your ticket.

2512
02:24:51,360 --> 02:24:55,260
I know King Samurai he is,
that is a crazy front kick though.

2513
02:24:55,261 --> 02:24:56,220
And it's the same thing.

2514
02:24:58,460 --> 02:25:01,530
Well you know Leo and damaged and are
partners in crime act to back that up

2515
02:25:01,531 --> 02:25:05,070
again. Let me, let me see something
there. Oh, come on. How cool is this?

2516
02:25:05,840 --> 02:25:10,020
Your beat toss? Not, the cool
thing about the front kick is man,

2517
02:25:10,021 --> 02:25:11,280
if it's going to the face,

2518
02:25:11,281 --> 02:25:14,580
it's such a different thing
than if it's gone to the chest.

2519
02:25:14,581 --> 02:25:17,510
Don't bow to me like that FTE
fucking knocked my head off.

2520
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:20,580
It's going to the chest you're
looking at like move away from that.

2521
02:25:20,610 --> 02:25:24,590
But it's going on the face and it's like,
it's not like a,

2522
02:25:25,710 --> 02:25:28,570
yeah. And a lot of times when
guys would take it to the body,

2523
02:25:28,571 --> 02:25:30,970
what they would do is kind of like
almost like move with it a little bit,

2524
02:25:31,150 --> 02:25:34,150
try to move with it, but that doesn't
help you if it goes up to your chin.

2525
02:25:34,750 --> 02:25:38,680
Liotta is just that career ender like
this is your last fight. Very cool. Randy,

2526
02:25:38,740 --> 02:25:43,270
check this out. This is your
last one. Let's try. This

2527
02:25:44,950 --> 02:25:46,870
was terrible. That was terrible. Munoz,

2528
02:25:46,871 --> 02:25:50,740
we need to take this fine short notes
and we've all been trained together.

2529
02:25:50,770 --> 02:25:54,910
Leo told me and what we're all trained,
the super jacked one to fly to London,

2530
02:25:55,630 --> 02:25:57,310
but look how yoga was then.

2531
02:25:57,340 --> 02:26:01,930
That was the oldest first spin at one 85
let's take a look at that again. Say it.

2532
02:26:01,950 --> 02:26:05,140
Yeah. He's a great guy. He didn't,
he had a perfect opportunity to him.

2533
02:26:06,100 --> 02:26:07,900
First of all,
those two are the best man.

2534
02:26:07,901 --> 02:26:11,660
I know that a vendor entered that right
man. They're both the or whatever.

2535
02:26:11,670 --> 02:26:15,620
A long time. If those were my training
partner. Damn, that's an amazing hand.

2536
02:26:15,640 --> 02:26:19,870
These guys here, the, I saw you roll with
that. Leo was such an unusual, finer,

2537
02:26:19,871 --> 02:26:23,260
so difficult to deal with. The
Nice, I remember four years ago,

2538
02:26:23,320 --> 02:26:25,420
three years ago when the
lock and we'd done trained,

2539
02:26:25,421 --> 02:26:28,300
just had this brutal training
session at blackouts and I go,

2540
02:26:28,330 --> 02:26:31,930
how much longer you to do this shit
man. And he goes, six years. I went,

2541
02:26:32,190 --> 02:26:35,650
the fuck it. You know you have six years.
Like we're like laughing. He's like,

2542
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:38,900
well for sure I do. I'm to forget
as long as six. Yeah, he's,

2543
02:26:38,950 --> 02:26:42,520
well now he's in Beltour. He's like
legit marsh warranty. Yeah. Oh yeah.

2544
02:26:42,521 --> 02:26:45,000
He got a new warranty
function keys on van eyes.

2545
02:26:46,180 --> 02:26:48,520
You can keep it rolling.
It's chuck.

2546
02:26:48,521 --> 02:26:50,460
Is Chuck actually going to
fight Tito or is that kind of,

2547
02:26:50,461 --> 02:26:53,950
that's happening in golden boy.
What's going to happen though there?

2548
02:26:53,980 --> 02:26:55,840
They listened.
They said that it's going to happen,

2549
02:26:55,841 --> 02:26:59,860
but there's no venue picked out that he's
got to pass boards and a Dane is very,

2550
02:26:59,861 --> 02:27:02,740
very concerned about it. Yeah.
You know, a lot of people concern,

2551
02:27:02,770 --> 02:27:05,710
like Dana said publicly that he didn't,

2552
02:27:05,770 --> 02:27:08,920
I mean there's a reason why you asked
chuck to retire or nine years ago.

2553
02:27:09,330 --> 02:27:11,470
You know, he doesn't, he doesn't
think it's right and he wouldn't,

2554
02:27:11,471 --> 02:27:13,840
he wouldn't put the fight on himself.
I mean,

2555
02:27:13,841 --> 02:27:17,350
whoever would put the fight on would make
a shitload of money credit to them for

2556
02:27:17,351 --> 02:27:20,560
not wanting to do it. Cause Danny cares
about chuck. But Chuck wants a fight.

2557
02:27:20,830 --> 02:27:23,560
So who, yeah, how are you going to stay?
You got to stop him. He didn't stop.

2558
02:27:23,570 --> 02:27:26,830
If it goes down, I want to fight
and Oscar medically can magically.

2559
02:27:26,860 --> 02:27:29,260
The thing is the, the
whoever the board, I mean,

2560
02:27:29,290 --> 02:27:31,690
I don't know what his medical
condition is. You have to check.

2561
02:27:31,710 --> 02:27:33,670
You have to think of how do they check?
That's a good question.

2562
02:27:33,820 --> 02:27:35,350
That's a good question.
We have cat scans.

2563
02:27:35,370 --> 02:27:37,690
You have I where they're
going to do it too.

2564
02:27:38,240 --> 02:27:41,350
Highly doubt they do
in la or cat or Nevada.

2565
02:27:41,700 --> 02:27:44,370
Anna cat on the Camden, New York. No,

2566
02:27:44,380 --> 02:27:47,740
it's gonna be on like an
Indian reservation or some
shit like Tacoma fucking

2567
02:27:47,741 --> 02:27:50,710
Indian reservation or
some shit. Right. Tacoma.

2568
02:27:50,920 --> 02:27:53,650
Is that real disrespectful?

2569
02:27:54,210 --> 02:27:57,240
He goes like Tacoma fucking

2570
02:27:58,770 --> 02:27:59,603
so

2571
02:28:03,490 --> 02:28:04,323
they'll do it.

2572
02:28:07,530 --> 02:28:12,480
That's what I was looking for.
Yeah. They'll do it. A Little Fox,

2573
02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:15,090
big fights of Fox with you know,

2574
02:28:15,100 --> 02:28:19,390
and obviously you know you're dealing
with Oscar de la Hoya has a long history

2575
02:28:19,391 --> 02:28:22,190
of promoting. He knows where he can get
away with what and what they can do,

2576
02:28:22,370 --> 02:28:26,060
but it's the thing is like will they do
that or will they give them some real

2577
02:28:26,061 --> 02:28:29,810
examinations and find out how Chuck's
doing and Hey, Tina is good to go,

2578
02:28:30,190 --> 02:28:33,850
good to go. He's been fighting recently.
He's been winning recently. Guy. He goes,

2579
02:28:33,880 --> 02:28:35,990
can you fine? You talked
to Tito. I talked to Tito,

2580
02:28:35,991 --> 02:28:39,890
real recent life teen on my
show like every week. He's
100% there. He's the best.

2581
02:28:39,950 --> 02:28:43,040
He's there. He's good
man. He's a good guy.

2582
02:28:43,460 --> 02:28:46,880
We have an impression of Tito that a lot
of it is based on his interactions with

2583
02:28:46,881 --> 02:28:48,830
other people, his fights. So stupid,

2584
02:28:48,831 --> 02:28:53,210
but also that that's a
product of the times with him
because he was this bad ass.

2585
02:28:53,220 --> 02:28:57,410
The Huntington beach bad boy. There was
no podcasting, there was no social media

2586
02:28:58,920 --> 02:29:02,810
podcasts. And so to know him know,
so Tino came on if Tito at the time,

2587
02:29:02,850 --> 02:29:05,060
as big as he is and he
can't on your podcast,

2588
02:29:05,200 --> 02:29:07,740
he had been even bigger cause you go,
oh my God,

2589
02:29:07,930 --> 02:29:10,940
that guy you did come on my podcast many,
many years ago,

2590
02:29:11,090 --> 02:29:12,830
but he'd already retired.
He retired.

2591
02:29:13,070 --> 02:29:16,550
I'm saying they've came and went during
its hay day, Sunny beach, bad boy.

2592
02:29:16,820 --> 02:29:20,090
And you were as big as you are now with
this podcast and you got his story out

2593
02:29:20,091 --> 02:29:24,650
while my God, well I mean you
have an idea who that person is.

2594
02:29:24,651 --> 02:29:28,970
Like Kevin Lee's a perfect example,
right? He got this great guy, super smart,

2595
02:29:29,240 --> 02:29:33,880
super tuned in, super ambitious fucking
amazing fighter and youngest shit. Yeah,

2596
02:29:33,950 --> 02:29:37,580
massive, massive potential. But
people saw him on the podcast,

2597
02:29:37,581 --> 02:29:40,910
got to hear him talk for three hours
and he's super honest about everything

2598
02:29:40,911 --> 02:29:45,380
about and articulate, articulate, smart,
outgoing, great control of his ego.

2599
02:29:45,381 --> 02:29:48,080
He's not, he's not a maniac.
He's a psych a really? Yeah.

2600
02:29:48,090 --> 02:29:49,670
Cause you get an and sound bytes,

2601
02:29:49,671 --> 02:29:51,320
you get such a different
impression of certain things,

2602
02:29:51,321 --> 02:29:53,610
especially in those interviews, man.
Those interviews at guys like Tony,

2603
02:29:53,630 --> 02:29:55,680
what you're gonna do to your opponent,
I'm gonna fuck him.

2604
02:29:55,750 --> 02:29:58,280
You're talking about why when I
rubbed off the scale and I'm like,

2605
02:29:58,540 --> 02:30:01,430
energizer is like, what are you gonna do
to him? You're all aggressive, you know,

2606
02:30:01,440 --> 02:30:01,890
playing a,

2607
02:30:01,890 --> 02:30:06,230
you who would I think
would grow even bigger as a
superstar if they did a pocket.

2608
02:30:06,260 --> 02:30:08,420
Your podcast. Who? Conor McGregor. Oh,

2609
02:30:08,421 --> 02:30:11,570
you have sat down with tell
cat while I'm just like, no,

2610
02:30:11,580 --> 02:30:15,590
I think you would get less hate. Obviously
he has all the accolades in the world,

2611
02:30:15,591 --> 02:30:18,380
but, and there's the s the stool
or the Dolly, all that shit.

2612
02:30:18,890 --> 02:30:21,050
But as a person and he sat
down and you talk to him,

2613
02:30:21,080 --> 02:30:23,900
you just didn't get all
that Hoopla over here.

2614
02:30:24,050 --> 02:30:27,630
And you sat down and talked to him. Oh,
I think you'd be. Even when he retired.

2615
02:30:27,660 --> 02:30:31,040
I don't get that. Why? We almost
did it before. There was some,

2616
02:30:31,280 --> 02:30:34,550
some trying to figure out times
like before he became gigantic,

2617
02:30:34,551 --> 02:30:38,090
before the Diaz fight, before he won
the title. There was some talk about it.

2618
02:30:38,091 --> 02:30:41,600
It just, you know what man?
For better or for worse,

2619
02:30:41,720 --> 02:30:44,340
I don't chase anybody and I
would definitely say no, no, no.

2620
02:30:44,400 --> 02:30:47,480
I'm not saying you are, but I'm saying,
I know there's some great guests.

2621
02:30:47,481 --> 02:30:50,960
Like I know, I know there's some people
that I would really like to get on,

2622
02:30:50,961 --> 02:30:52,580
but if it doesn't happen,
it doesn't happen.

2623
02:30:52,760 --> 02:30:57,320
I like having you guys on as much as I
like some scientist who flies in from

2624
02:30:57,321 --> 02:31:01,190
France. I really do. I just like, I
like talking to people that are fun.

2625
02:31:01,191 --> 02:31:04,910
Whether it's talking to you guys are
talking to whoever the fuck it is.

2626
02:31:04,911 --> 02:31:07,310
I would like to get Obama on one day.
I would like to talk to him.

2627
02:31:07,910 --> 02:31:08,661
You're getting huge.

2628
02:31:08,661 --> 02:31:11,600
Maybe I would like to talk to a lot of
people and she's like, take a Trump bump.

2629
02:31:12,170 --> 02:31:14,150
I would talk to him. Yeah. Why? Why not?

2630
02:31:14,390 --> 02:31:17,840
When are you going to get
real answers though? Cause
he's the president, you know,

2631
02:31:17,990 --> 02:31:20,820
you'll find out if you get real answers.
Did you talk to mayor? Have you,

2632
02:31:20,821 --> 02:31:23,820
have you talked to mom about when he
had Obama on net to submit a list of

2633
02:31:23,821 --> 02:31:27,210
question that the okay. The questions
and it goes and even, you know, he goes,

2634
02:31:27,211 --> 02:31:28,830
listen, it was great. I'm
glad to give him the time,

2635
02:31:28,831 --> 02:31:30,890
but that's not like a real podcast.
Right?

2636
02:31:32,220 --> 02:31:34,920
There can be an agenda and I can't
know what I'm going to ask you next.

2637
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:38,420
I come home like when we come on here,
fight campaigns or our podcast,

2638
02:31:38,700 --> 02:31:41,880
I have no agenda. I have
no idea what we're going to
talk to you. They have to be,

2639
02:31:41,970 --> 02:31:45,300
they have to be concerned that you're
gonna set them up and make them look bad.

2640
02:31:46,050 --> 02:31:49,170
There's so much on the line for
everything. And when Obama was doing this,

2641
02:31:49,230 --> 02:31:53,460
Obama was a sitting president. He
was about to leave office. You know,

2642
02:31:53,461 --> 02:31:56,460
and they probably had very
strict rules in terms of what,

2643
02:31:56,461 --> 02:31:58,440
what they would allow and not
allow in terms of interviews.

2644
02:31:58,441 --> 02:32:00,170
And this isn't the platform for him.

2645
02:32:00,340 --> 02:32:02,400
He thinks Trump doesn't
give a fuck about all that.

2646
02:32:02,430 --> 02:32:07,230
I guarantee you he would be more confident
and more open to just being able to

2647
02:32:07,231 --> 02:32:09,570
figure his way through it
because he wouldn't worry about,

2648
02:32:10,620 --> 02:32:14,410
he doesn't prepare first and also wouldn't
worry about me outmaneuvering him.

2649
02:32:14,700 --> 02:32:18,990
Like he's not, he's not the
smart dude, but also, have
you ever heard Trump before?

2650
02:32:18,991 --> 02:32:21,750
He was present on Stern. Yeah. There's
some of the greatest interviews.

2651
02:32:21,751 --> 02:32:26,280
He's hilarious. Well, he was great
and, but even, but he's also older,

2652
02:32:26,460 --> 02:32:26,791
you know,

2653
02:32:26,791 --> 02:32:30,060
and then also the pressure that Gig and
then the pressure of everybody hating

2654
02:32:30,061 --> 02:32:33,300
him. Yeah. You know, the whole thing
is fine. And I'm not saying this,

2655
02:32:34,260 --> 02:32:35,700
that he's the greatest guy in the world,

2656
02:32:35,730 --> 02:32:38,310
but I'm saying the whole thing is insane.

2657
02:32:38,340 --> 02:32:41,220
Nobody should be president
fucking thankless job.

2658
02:32:41,250 --> 02:32:42,660
Nobody shouldn't have that kind of power.

2659
02:32:42,780 --> 02:32:47,780
And it's such a dumb move to take
that Gig at 70 it seems to me in such

2660
02:32:48,751 --> 02:32:52,620
decision, you make you piss off 50%
of the people and you make 50% no,

2661
02:32:52,660 --> 02:32:54,630
you're not going to win.
How much time do you have left?

2662
02:32:54,660 --> 02:32:55,860
What do you have 20 years left?

2663
02:32:55,861 --> 02:33:00,540
If every cherry on the Sundae for a guy
like that was accomplished with his ego,

2664
02:33:00,541 --> 02:33:04,370
but also to say, hey, you have four years
to accomplish all this. I fuck for him.

2665
02:33:04,920 --> 02:33:09,570
Do you know who that John Luca Vivace
guy is? He's that a Italian guy.

2666
02:33:09,571 --> 02:33:13,620
He's a, he does a lot of dancing on
the Instagram super millionaire guy.

2667
02:33:14,040 --> 02:33:16,680
Go to his, his Instagram.
He's got a patio in shape.

2668
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:19,240
He's got a video of him dancing
and there's all of these, uh,

2669
02:33:19,290 --> 02:33:22,950
girls with thought behind him,
bent over with their ass up in the air.

2670
02:33:22,980 --> 02:33:24,380
So He's a Italian.
That's him.

2671
02:33:24,390 --> 02:33:27,300
We're supposed to be doing
when you've got Trump money,

2672
02:33:27,450 --> 02:33:31,860
what Trump's should be doing is fucking
be half naked by the pool dancing in

2673
02:33:31,861 --> 02:33:34,120
front of book. I guess
sternness, look at this.

2674
02:33:34,380 --> 02:33:37,140
I'm watching to watch this real quick.
This is what if I was,

2675
02:33:37,230 --> 02:33:42,180
if I was friends with Trump, I would
say, listen, Bro. Powerful one.

2676
02:33:42,200 --> 02:33:46,830
If we had bike, this guy, he's
my, he's younger than me, so
he's not, no, he's not. No.

2677
02:33:46,831 --> 02:33:49,910
Brian, he's older than
you. He's 50 50 yeah, he's,

2678
02:33:50,110 --> 02:33:54,840
he's in the neighborhood.
Oh, so you can't haul,

2679
02:33:54,860 --> 02:33:57,160
he's a little wrinkle because
he's in the sun every day,

2680
02:33:57,430 --> 02:34:01,600
but meanwhile he's doing this every day
to look at is awesome. Ankle bracelets,

2681
02:34:02,200 --> 02:34:06,040
dude. Look at the bitches in the back.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, this is the point.

2682
02:34:06,370 --> 02:34:08,740
This is what I would tell
Trump to be doing. Do this.

2683
02:34:08,741 --> 02:34:13,010
And then La Loche watch the girls behind
them. Those hard life goals. However,

2684
02:34:13,060 --> 02:34:17,530
that's how I see. I see a lonely
man. I think you're wrong. Look,

2685
02:34:17,650 --> 02:34:22,180
he's happy. He's happy as shit. He's
always laughing, always smiling.

2686
02:34:22,210 --> 02:34:26,320
Either it's a tremendous act
or he is actually a happy,

2687
02:34:26,321 --> 02:34:31,240
rich guys banging tens over
the world and he's doing, he's,

2688
02:34:31,330 --> 02:34:35,620
he's working as a Dj everywhere and he's
got all these videos of him having a

2689
02:34:35,621 --> 02:34:38,660
great time. Oh Wow. Dude.

2690
02:34:39,100 --> 02:34:41,800
Would you rather be him or Trump?
That's what I'm saying.

2691
02:34:42,010 --> 02:34:44,500
This guy's having a great time
with his money. All these people,

2692
02:34:44,501 --> 02:34:46,990
it's all love and happiness
is jetting all over the world.

2693
02:34:47,260 --> 02:34:52,150
I'd have to say on stand up please.
Elan Musk take notes. Pro Trump is just,

2694
02:34:52,690 --> 02:34:55,800
you know, he's a guy wanted to
win. Look at hyster steel. Yo,

2695
02:34:55,820 --> 02:35:00,610
come look at that outfit. Get some fucking
tattoos and computers and tats salary.

2696

Like somebody just wrote on
him when got your marker,

2697
02:35:03,070 --> 02:35:04,540
but he's got some bad tattoos too.

2698
02:35:04,541 --> 02:35:08,260
He's got a picture of his face on
his back going like this. Shush.

2699
02:35:08,350 --> 02:35:12,440
It's the shut the fuck up tattoo.
He says it's a, it's a very, very,

2700
02:35:12,580 --> 02:35:16,240
it's a very unfortunate tattoo. We are
Billy and you do where the fuck you. Yeah,

2701
02:35:17,070 --> 02:35:19,540
this is him.
[inaudible]

2702
02:35:20,030 --> 02:35:24,790
Hashtag [inaudible] Hashtag [inaudible]
and pimping all over the world.

2703
02:35:25,150 --> 02:35:29,530
Hashtag g g lifestyle. He's got it
tattooed on his leg. That's aggressive.

2704
02:35:29,531 --> 02:35:32,130
But when your ability to,
oh, he's got water there.

2705
02:35:32,410 --> 02:35:35,210
You want to just love on his right tit
because you need love and you're right it

2706
02:35:35,700 --> 02:35:38,500
dude, he's kind of killed
it. This is the thing, man.

2707
02:35:38,530 --> 02:35:40,490
This guy smiling every time I see Trump,

2708
02:35:40,491 --> 02:35:45,490
he's got a bigger and bigger frown and
he's aging course agent like fruit,

2709
02:35:48,770 --> 02:35:53,070
aging fruit.
Yeah.

2710
02:35:53,080 --> 02:35:55,480
It's not a fine wine cheese.

2711
02:35:55,650 --> 02:35:58,420
The fucking most recent Cohen tapes,

2712
02:35:58,421 --> 02:36:02,760
Cohen's releasing tapes now
of him negotiating about
the paying off a Gal. Yeah,

2713
02:36:02,770 --> 02:36:04,360
well they,
they seize those tapes.

2714
02:36:04,600 --> 02:36:08,920
How was not cones in the
system sees the nine tapes,

2715
02:36:09,070 --> 02:36:12,250
I believe. Just, Oh,
they definitely did that,

2716
02:36:12,251 --> 02:36:16,390
but I believe they said that Cohen
released them to CNN. Is that true?

2717
02:36:16,480 --> 02:36:19,480
See if that's true. Did you see that?
His wife got busted watching CNN.

2718
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:23,980
He freaked out. She was on Air Force
One watching CNN just hating on them.

2719
02:36:24,310 --> 02:36:28,540
They call it hate watching. She doesn't
mean he wasn't enjoying them. Come on.

2720
02:36:28,550 --> 02:36:33,310
She's got a tough when when the stormy
Daniels and the other one comes out,

2721
02:36:33,340 --> 02:36:37,360
you know, dude, you know what?
That's true. Who's fucking her?

2722
02:36:37,390 --> 02:36:39,250
Where's that dude?
She's a beautiful,

2723
02:36:39,251 --> 02:36:41,380
well she's probably keeping
it together for a kid, man.

2724
02:36:41,381 --> 02:36:42,910
She's got a 10 year old kid.
Here it is.

2725
02:36:42,911 --> 02:36:45,310
Donald Trump erupted with
rage from Melanie's air force.

2726
02:36:45,311 --> 02:36:49,980
One TV was tuned to CNN says leaked email.
How crazy.

2727
02:36:50,080 --> 02:36:53,140
The president is in a battle with CNN.

2728
02:36:53,410 --> 02:36:56,830
That is so kind of winning.
I'm saying kind of winning.

2729
02:36:56,860 --> 02:37:01,860
Well definitely 100% done is damaged
their reputation among the young people

2730
02:37:03,470 --> 02:37:07,510
kind of dessert sometimes like some
of the mainstream media deserves.

2731
02:37:07,510 --> 02:37:10,510
Because what happens now is to
stay in business, they've got it.

2732
02:37:10,570 --> 02:37:14,260
They've got to create click bait shit,
head White House bands,

2733
02:37:14,261 --> 02:37:16,880
network pool from Rose Garden event.
Who's this?

2734
02:37:16,881 --> 02:37:19,450
She asked him about the
colon tapes and hey,

2735
02:37:19,451 --> 02:37:22,970
she got banned from you can get
banned if you ask them questions.

2736
02:37:23,480 --> 02:37:25,950
How does that work? Do you have
the z? Like he's Marin Cherry.

2737
02:37:26,510 --> 02:37:31,220
You have the fucking list of questions.
Always reserve the right to sort of,

2738
02:37:31,300 --> 02:37:35,420
you're invited into the press
pool I believe. And, uh,

2739
02:37:35,690 --> 02:37:38,330
I think until there's been that sort of
a depressant progress there all these

2740
02:37:38,331 --> 02:37:39,670
little sneaky,

2741
02:37:39,671 --> 02:37:42,890
it'll be a little sneaky things that the
executive power has that that's kind of

2742
02:37:42,891 --> 02:37:46,760
granted to the executive. The craziest
one is the pardon thing. You can go again.

2743
02:37:46,780 --> 02:37:48,570
They killed a bunch of
people, Brian, but I like you.

2744
02:37:48,571 --> 02:37:53,360
We like smoke stove used together. Yup.
Did you guys listen to 'em? I admit it.

2745
02:37:53,420 --> 02:37:58,040
The new r Kelly, 19 minutes saw
having, I've heard it's amazing.

2746
02:37:58,070 --> 02:38:02,570
Is it because he talks about he
basically a 14 girl and got away with it

2747
02:38:04,510 --> 02:38:09,170
there. That's supposedly what
happened. Yeah, but does he
admit a lot of it? I mean,

2748
02:38:09,460 --> 02:38:13,070
no, he doesn't admit peanut
anybody or that the video was him.

2749
02:38:13,760 --> 02:38:15,220
What's he admit?
He admitted it's,

2750
02:38:15,221 --> 02:38:19,370
it's most of the song is just him talking
about all the chicks he banged and

2751
02:38:19,371 --> 02:38:21,250
about how they took all
his money because the,

2752
02:38:21,260 --> 02:38:24,320
they made them sign contracts when he
was young and he was dyslexic and he

2753
02:38:24,321 --> 02:38:25,131
couldn't read gateway.

2754
02:38:25,131 --> 02:38:30,131
All the rights to his music and talking
about all flaws that he has and how many

2755
02:38:30,231 --> 02:38:34,560
girls he lied to and how many girls he
banged and goes over all that stuff.

2756
02:38:34,590 --> 02:38:37,130
So that whole story about
him with the young girl with

2757
02:38:39,110 --> 02:38:41,690
wait who said that? Who said that? I
don't know. He got her off. It'd be,

2758
02:38:41,720 --> 02:38:43,760
and I know that he was with a 14 year old.
What was that?

2759
02:38:44,110 --> 02:38:48,410
Lists some just to get someone gets
off or a jury of their peers doesn't

2760
02:38:48,411 --> 02:38:51,140
convince you me off. I
thought, who the fuck knows?

2761
02:38:51,590 --> 02:38:54,560
But it does not mean that he didn't
do it. Know? Have you seen the video?

2762
02:38:55,010 --> 02:38:58,630
It looks like, yeah. No, no.
I watched them piss on a curl.

2763
02:38:58,770 --> 02:39:01,610
It certainly looks like it. Here
it goes. Start Kelly secretly.

2764
02:39:01,611 --> 02:39:06,300
Mary's 15 year old Aaliyah 22
years ago today. Yeah, that
was it. No, no, that was a,

2765
02:39:06,410 --> 02:39:09,790
that was a singer. I know. That was a
different thing. That's in the song too.

2766
02:39:11,710 --> 02:39:15,890
Yeah. Well that alone is illegal
in a lot of places, right?

2767
02:39:16,290 --> 02:39:20,090
It's also some place they legally
everywhere in the United States today.

2768
02:39:20,120 --> 02:39:25,070
I think 16 in Vegas is 22 years ago
though. Was it? Cause that's what it was.

2769
02:39:25,130 --> 02:39:28,430
I think it was always 16 right?
I think 15 seems very young.

2770
02:39:28,431 --> 02:39:30,830
They kept that under wraps.
So that wasn't public knowledge.

2771
02:39:30,890 --> 02:39:35,890
I think the age of consent varies in the
states and has been different over the

2772
02:39:38,090 --> 02:39:39,950
last couple of decades.
And I think 22 years ago what he did,

2773
02:39:39,980 --> 02:39:44,690
I don't think it was illegal. What does it
mean? Is it Mexico? 14 in Mexico, Mexico,

2774
02:39:44,691 --> 02:39:47,180
Mexico, Mexico. Mexico is probably
real young. Is that where he did it?

2775
02:39:47,181 --> 02:39:51,310
I thought I was 14 I would
imagine if for could be. Well,

2776
02:39:51,550 --> 02:39:54,110
that's a weird thing, right? Like if
it's illegal in the United States,

2777
02:39:54,111 --> 02:39:55,580
but it's legal somewhere else.

2778
02:39:55,640 --> 02:39:58,730
If you go to Japan or wherever the fuck
it's legal and you get married and then

2779
02:39:58,731 --> 02:40:00,920
you come back to the states,
can you live as a husband and wife?

2780
02:40:00,921 --> 02:40:01,860
How the fuck does that work?

2781
02:40:02,690 --> 02:40:06,080
When I was 12 in Mexico,

2782
02:40:06,081 --> 02:40:11,010
it's as low as 12 well maybe as
low as 12 can I get a whoop, whoop.

2783
02:40:11,570 --> 02:40:15,000
So, well, but why? You know,

2784
02:40:15,300 --> 02:40:18,180
why don't you know we need
to incorporate them. Stop.

2785
02:40:18,430 --> 02:40:21,270
Just tell Mexico for us and
we're going to make drugs, legal.

2786
02:40:21,600 --> 02:40:25,530
[inaudible] we're going to pull the all
the troops out of Afghanistan and Iraq.

2787
02:40:25,560 --> 02:40:29,310
We're not Mexico cleanup all
the drug cartel bullshit.

2788
02:40:29,340 --> 02:40:31,770
But let's cut off the 12 year old shit.
Let's just stop all that.

2789
02:40:31,900 --> 02:40:35,790
You want to make a beat? 18. Jesus Christ.
We're neighbors. Keep it respectable.

2790
02:40:35,880 --> 02:40:38,700
Keep it respectable. [inaudible]
not good. Oh boop. Brian Callan,

2791

you worked very, very hard for this.

2792
02:40:41,431 --> 02:40:45,600
I'm very proud of you and I, I was, it
was awesome to see you gear up for it.

2793
02:40:45,690 --> 02:40:50,430
See how fucking fired up you got. And you
were doing a lot of touring and a new,

2794
02:40:50,431 --> 02:40:53,340
you were constantly doing sets around
town and constantly writing on it and

2795
02:40:53,341 --> 02:40:54,510
working on it and tweaking on it.

2796
02:40:54,510 --> 02:40:57,330
You could tell you tell you were really
obsessed with it, man. Thank you man.

2797
02:40:57,331 --> 02:41:00,920
It's the best thing I ever did. So
I'm, I'm happy. Better be Jesus Christ.

2798
02:41:01,060 --> 02:41:05,250
I'm just kidding. Christ. Um, so
when you do, now you're going to,

2799
02:41:05,370 --> 02:41:08,250
so now it's being edited and then
you get to rush shop shit, shop.

2800
02:41:08,251 --> 02:41:12,580
Take some time now. Take some openings.
You have one more shy. Just hit you.

2801
02:41:12,581 --> 02:41:16,950
You don't have the whole rest of the
year off standup because, uh, uh,

2802
