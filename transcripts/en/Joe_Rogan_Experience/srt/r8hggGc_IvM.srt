1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,860
There we go.
Beautiful.

2
00:00:01,861 --> 00:00:05,580
Ladies and Gentlemen,
welcome to day 25,

3
00:00:05,581 --> 00:00:06,960
Brian,
25,

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,160
25 week,
week 25.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,240
You stream podcasts.
We've got a double podcast week.

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,750
We're getting crazy.
Today is my good friend.

7
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:19,940
Mad Flavor,
Aka Joe t as in the motherfucking house,

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,470
one of the funniest human beings I've 
ever met in my life.

9
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:24,750
I've known joey for about a decade.
Oh,

10
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:26,520
before we go anywhere before we get 
started.

11
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,540
Fleshlight.com.
We are sponsored by the flashlights and 

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,530
this is the butthole version of the 
fleshlight.

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,640
It's sponsoring the podcast.
If you go to a Joe Rogan.net

14
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:46,410
and click the link,
you get like a discount.

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,440
Joey Diaz.
Have you ever seen one of those in 

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:51,440
persona?
That little burp it up and explain it to

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:51,940
me.
They'll say,

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,930
let's talk about it.
This is the one that I haven't fucked so

19
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:59,931
you can touch it with your finger in 
there and tell me that's the butthole 

20
00:00:59,931 --> 00:00:59,931
version.

21
00:00:59,931 --> 00:01:03,380
Those the butthole.
Is there a vaginal birth yet so far is 

22
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,820
really retarded.
How perverted either.

23
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,870
Could you imagine if the vaginal one 
went out of style?

24
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:11,871
Because nobody wanted to fuck it.
It's like everyone's just wanted the 

25
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:11,871
asshole.
Well it is tighter.

26
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:14,460
So you think everyone would want to fuck
because everyone likes tight pussy.

27
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,560
Fucking square.
It was a good big Scott to be like a 

28
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:20,560
fucking square.
I love it.

29
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,000
I love it.
This is tremendous.

30
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,590
You got to fuck one of these things I'm 
telling.

31
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,840
Are you fucking crazy?
It's way better the beat.

32
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:29,841
Now if you bit off right?
So you grab it like this and just go 

33
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:30,720
like this.
Like a little fish in the bucket.

34
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:35,721
Some fish in the bucket.
It's just take the piss out of the 

35
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:35,721
bucket.
That's your move.

36
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:36,690
Dude.
I don't want to check this out.

37
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,030
How awesome is this fish in the bucket?

38
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,480
Look at that thing.
That's how you wash.

39
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,490
It pulls out it wiggles.
So you come in that thing and there's a 

40
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,420
cap on the bottom.
When you undo the cap,

41
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,450
your load comes from.
I love hanging out with these guys 

42
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:53,520
because technology,
they always keep me up.

43
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:54,450
This shit.
You know what I'm saying?

44
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,690
We're up to the latest.
This is the latest in masturbation.

45
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,580
Technical people hanging out with that 
disappeared.

46
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,870
This is show up with a box with all of 
the product.

47
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,080
There's a solid product and this product
comes under a lot of unnecessary heat,

48
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:11,030
in my opinion.
Now,

49
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:13,350
let me ask you,
what if you want to go the other way?

50
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:15,390
There's this come in different colors.
What if you want to fuck?

51
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,560
You know what I'm saying?
He had a brown one.

52
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,530
You get a Hindu one.
We've got to find that.

53
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:19,820
They got to.

54
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,780
Or a slum dog.
Millionaire.

55
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,170
One smells like a fucking lottery.
Tickets.

56
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,530
There's a difference.
A bunch of different colors there has.

57
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,930
We can't just be white.
That's prejudice.

58
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,080
There's 2010.
You got to mix it up a little bit.

59
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:33,960
Shit is this.
I mean,

60
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,910
yeah.
I guess I would do a black on her mother

61
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,450
as well.
One of the Asian one and what?

62
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,220
The little muffler.
Slowly twice cooked pork,

63
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,940
but there's a reason why like the black 
ones show the cross.

64
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,940
How dirty it is.
More probably,

65
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:48,750
you know,
it gets white.

66
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,350
What's it going to say?
Black and she'd be a little too high.

67
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,680
What are you talking about?
Okay.

68
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,590
We're on the front page and I just see 
nothing but white pussy.

69
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,070
Yeah,
let's

70
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,880
go with the champagne collection.
They have a loop,

71
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:06,820
a version of it.
You know who Lupez all white buzzy.

72
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,640
The Puerto Rican singer from the 17th.
No,

73
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,630
Lupa is this new porn star.
They have a loop,

74
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:15,631
a version of the flashlight,
and I was just at the hardrock x fans 

75
00:03:15,631 --> 00:03:15,640
convention and she was there.
Man,

76
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:18,430
that chick is amazing.
She's like four feet tall,

77
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,390
but yet the proportions perfect of a 
regular female,

78
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,060
like everything's fits perfect.
This looks like a little girl now,

79
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:30,061
like a midget.
I wonder if you can get a blue one so 

80
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:30,061
you can pretend you're fucking that 
avatar.

81
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,260
They have vampires.
Vampire ones.

82
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,080
They should totally make it.
Twilight ones.

83
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,070
Do you say the twilight one?
Flesh lines.

84
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,270
They have things.
They swear to God.

85
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,320
They have fangs in the tube that goes 
down that,

86
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,750
you know,
rubs against your Dick has like fangs on

87
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:45,100
the tube or something like that.

88
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:50,130
So it's like fucking a vampire pussy 
because I know you'd like vampires 

89
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:50,820
better than where it was.
Have you lost your fucking mind?

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,240
You.
You're so big.

91
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:58,080
That's 100 percent true.
All of that is that in Werewolf who 

92
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,380
loves do you said you liked him last 
week better,

93
00:04:00,381 --> 00:04:00,980
right?
Goodness.

94
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:06,190
And I've been thinking about this whole 
time because he likes making shit up.

95
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,920
Brian's,
you didn't say that.

96
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:13,921
You didn't say you were choosing just 
back to the eighth grade silly eighth 

97
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:20,161
grader right now.
Outside when you're not supposed to be 

98
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:20,161
there.
Right.

99
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:23,080
You got out of the gymnasium when you 
and your buddies got high and now you're

100
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,910
cracking jokes on them.
You're back in Columbus,

101
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:26,110
Ohio right now.
Wait,

102
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,420
wait,
wait,

103
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:28,060
wait.
What's going on here?

104
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:33,410
Your barbecue barbecued.
I know you are because I am and I'm 

105
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,450
listening to you talk and I'm like,
this kid is too high.

106
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,250
I got to help him out of here.
I got to pull them out.

107
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,510
Pull out of this conversation.
But they do have a vampire fleshlight.

108
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,820
That's unbelievably ridiculous,
but I'm more of a Werewolf guy,

109
00:04:43,821 --> 00:04:48,821
so that's why it's ridiculous.
I don't even like vampire really tired 

110
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:48,821
of vampire movies.
The wolf man sucked.

111
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,200
Okay.
I did not like that movie.

112
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:53,860
It was dom just didn't work and I still 
bought the fucking blue.

113
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:54,840
Right.
Okay.

114
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,590
How about that?
That's how much I am.

115
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:58,270
Uh,
was there any special features?

116
00:04:58,271 --> 00:05:00,940
Search itunes for werewolf movies,
Bro.

117
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,020
Do you get this?
I watched werewolf movies that are 

118
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,020
terrible.
You know why?

119
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,960
Because I know there's going to be at 
least a guy's going to turn into a 

120
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,120
werewolf and flux and people up.
So you know what I do?

121
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,950
I watched the beginning to get their 
names.

122
00:05:11,951 --> 00:05:12,970
Okay.
This is Bob.

123
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:13,780
This is.
Okay.

124
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:15,070
Let me just know what the fuck's going 
on.

125
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,340
Let me fast forward until I see solar 
turtle where all fucking the best latest

126
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:24,660
technology and the dude turned to 
werewolf and just fucking people up is.

127
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,640
I just think those are the craziest 
movies.

128
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,480
The idea that I show American Werewolf 
in London got me hooked.

129
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,910
Yeah,
that was 1981 and I was aware will fan.

130
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:39,060
I was done,
but we still do other shit like Lon 

131
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,030
Chaney member.
Like the problem with this wolf man 

132
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:42,030
movie,
they went with a mask.

133
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,650
It's Benicia del Toro and a mask and 
he's like,

134
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:50,570
and his lower jaw sticks.
I show the transformation with the arms 

135
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,400
and the fucking thing,
you know,

136
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:52,930
they do.
I mean there's a lot of,

137
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,990
a lot of cool.
There's a lot of cool CGI in the 

138
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,010
transformation,
but the final product just looks.

139
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:03,220
It just doesn't look right because it's 
like he tried to use the old wolf man 

140
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,040
from like the 19 forties or whatever the
fuck it was.

141
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,560
He was at Claude rains,
I think it was,

142
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,510
to try to use that version of the wolf 
man and just make a more modern,

143
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,540
updated look after you go to American 
Werewolf in London,

144
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:19,541
you can't go backwards.
You can't because American Werewolf in 

145
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:20,990
London,
that fucking thing was evil man.

146
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:25,991
It was like a dog person.
Demon thing was on a four legs because 

147
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:27,270
that I'm blurring just for cats on Blu 
Ray.

148
00:06:27,271 --> 00:06:32,271
I got that Shit's on.
And like when they're running from it 

149
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:32,271
and you just see it,
they did that movie so well.

150
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:36,911
You don't really get to see it that much
because the technology was not that 

151
00:06:36,911 --> 00:06:40,391
good.
The only one time you get to actually 

152
00:06:40,391 --> 00:06:42,281
see the Werewolf,
he's going through the streets of 

153
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:44,291
London,
snap and people's heads off from 

154
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:44,291
everyone who was running through the 
streets.

155
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:44,690
Nobody's freaking out and car accidents 
and shit.

156
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,750
That's the only time you get to see it 
moving around every other time in the 

157
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:49,750
movie.
It's like you're barely see it,

158
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,050
but you see it enough that it's fucking 
terrifying.

159
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,020
And the transformation scene just off 
the chain,

160
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:59,470
you know,
that's the kind of shit that we had in 

161
00:06:59,470 --> 00:06:59,470
1981.
Okay.

162
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,850
Now what do they have?
They have vampires that don't bite 

163
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,761
people and where to just growl at 
everybody and can change back and forth 

164
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:10,871
when they want.
What the fuck have we come to the fuck 

165
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:11,840
are we?
Tell them to joey,

166
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:12,980
bro.
I can't even.

167
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:18,010
I've never watched the twilight's,
but I've seen what those two little 

168
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:18,590
fucking half a fruit cakes look like.
I can't believe they're vampires.

169
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,290
Vampires are bad.
Motherfucker bottom.

170
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,300
His College.
That's a vampire shadows and you know 

171
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,060
when you were vampire,
you fuck guys,

172
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:30,590
you fuck chicks.
It don't matter.

173
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,170
You Ain't gay.
You just slinked Dick,

174
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:35,040
you fucking dogs.
It don't matter.

175
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,580
You a fucking animal.
You know what I'm saying right now,

176
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:38,870
Gary Oldman,
Gary,

177
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,970
get the fuck these vampires a tool.
I don't know how to say it.

178
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:47,060
The to me,
it's Disney.

179
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,450
It's.
We've got a whole group of kids now that

180
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:55,451
are growing up with horrible mediocre 
entertainment that's designed just for 

181
00:07:55,451 --> 00:07:59,051
them as opposed to when we were kids 
were so fucking kids shows you add 

182
00:07:59,051 --> 00:07:59,300
sesame street,
you know,

183
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:00,880
you had a,
a fucking,

184
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,960
a couple other different shows,
you know,

185
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:08,040
that you could wash it,
but like kid oriented shows and 

186
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,040
everything else was a fucking adult 
show.

187
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,980
But the only kid show I ever watched was
Betty Hill,

188
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:10,370
like a motherfucker.
Anyway,

189
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:17,110
that was a kid.
I was really fucking great.

190
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,400
Every once in a while they show you a 
tinder or a great point.

191
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:24,080
You were six.
You last for a week.

192
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,740
He was like the first guy to figure out 
that very simple combination.

193
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,390
Tits,
tits,

194
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:34,540
tits and comedy and silliness and,
and started the accident way before 

195
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,020
gender.
Massada high.

196
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,400
The linguistic.
The answer the phone.

197
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,180
Unless people do make you think that 
shit is legit,

198
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,270
Susan,
for those late night infomercials.

199
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,150
So as an English person describing some 
products like God,

200
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,950
people pay more attention.
They think they're cooler or something.

201
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,480
When you meet a chick that has an accent
from over there,

202
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:56,100
I don't know,
but it makes her like two levels hotter.

203
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,720
Know you think,
well you know English dude.

204
00:08:57,721 --> 00:09:00,000
Say that to Dave Bishop says out of 
American girl,

205
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,580
that American accent,
he said he just so hot.

206
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:02,910
Damn.

207
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,380
I'm your soulmate dexter.

208
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,250
Yeah.
There's an English chicken,

209
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,920
Chinese chicken.
The why would have English accent.

210
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,480
Oh,
you talked to her.

211
00:09:13,481 --> 00:09:15,990
You lose your fucking.
Yeah.

212
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,650
You might want to take a yoga class that
check.

213
00:09:17,651 --> 00:09:18,200
Yeah.
No,

214
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,380
she's a very nice.
That's a strong.

215
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,200
That's a strong combo right there.
That's a double exotic.

216
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,360
You know,
that's a proper exotic and another 

217
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,360
exotic on top of that.
Oh,

218
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,930
you got to hear him.
But a strong one too,

219
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,200
you know,
look like a fucking guy in the life up.

220
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:37,780
You know what I'm saying?
Shit like that breaks up with you and 

221
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,201
starts fucking some new guy.
And you know what kind of pussy she's 

222
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:43,291
slinging at him.
You know what kind of crazy shit she's 

223
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:43,291
doing to him.
You know,

224
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,880
she said to put it in my ass saying 
crazy shit with that English accents to 

225
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,701
fuck you up.
People worshiped him saying you can't 

226
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:50,790
eat Chinese food or watch fucking 
beverly hills.

227
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,550
No more flashbacks.
It's horrible for her.

228
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,390
Favorite Shit.
She links to get fucked in the mouth.

229
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,940
My mouth.
Was He hard competition?

230
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:03,450
Was he hard competition you have.
Is that the American version of Benny 

231
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,390
Hill?
Because it seems like it's a TV show 

232
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:06,390
was.
It was a variety show country.

233
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:06,700
They used to have like songs.
They would play songs.

234
00:10:06,701 --> 00:10:08,240
They would do like sketches.
Listen,

235
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,840
it was a dumb ass show,
but when I was a kid I enjoyed it.

236
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,900
I used to go there for boobs also.
I remember Benny Hill and he hollered my

237
00:10:13,901 --> 00:10:15,400
to like,
I'll watch that.

238
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,530
He will have cleavage.
Yeah.

239
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:22,590
They had the blogs with Benny Hill would
show you it as something and they 

240
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,680
wouldn't catch it on channel nine and 
those days.

241
00:10:23,681 --> 00:10:24,970
So he got away with murder.
You know what?

242
00:10:24,971 --> 00:10:29,971
I'm saying Benny Hill was the first guy 
to have like a real silly showing him 

243
00:10:29,971 --> 00:10:33,571
chasing after girls and you know,
that famous song that they use all 

244
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,890
fucking stressed as hard on this country
has forgotten about the heart on.

245
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,940
No fucking respect to the heart on your 
right.

246
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:45,520
Benny Hill always.
That's because there's too many people.

247
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,140
Do you think that when when there gets 
overpopulation naturally people get more

248
00:10:50,141 --> 00:10:52,270
reluctant to hide shit like that.
We took,

249
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,420
we disregarded the heartland because 
they got cialis.

250
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,970
No it shouldn't.
Nobody would fucking beverly hills.

251
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:03,030
So they're just too common.
The hard ons to common now because of 

252
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,530
big,
because of a dick pills don't matter.

253
00:11:03,531 --> 00:11:05,370
I see.
In the old days it was a big deal.

254
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,920
It was a big deal because you can take 
fucking pills.

255
00:11:08,921 --> 00:11:10,810
You know what I'm saying?
Like the old days,

256
00:11:10,811 --> 00:11:13,360
a 62 year old guy that had a harder and 
it was like,

257
00:11:13,361 --> 00:11:14,890
wow,
that guy is excited.

258
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,990
Whoa.
Get Him.

259
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:18,030
He's got a boner and 62.
What'd you now?

260
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,520
It's like,
oh,

261
00:11:18,521 --> 00:11:20,170
that'll creep.
He's on fucking Viagra.

262
00:11:20,171 --> 00:11:20,440
Look at them.

263
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,470
Have you done any research on these GNC 
versions of Viagra that,

264
00:11:24,471 --> 00:11:25,820
that,
that are big right now?

265
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:26,870
They're almost like,
you know,

266
00:11:26,871 --> 00:11:28,790
there's just a bunch of vitamins and 
stuff like that.

267
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,560
Flashlight was telling us about that.
Telling us about one that works,

268
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,880
the one that actually had vicodin Viken 
invite Viagra in it as a good 30 percent

269
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:43,450
of.
It was weird to me because I wonder why 

270
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:47,141
it works.
They of course they had a booth like 

271
00:11:47,141 --> 00:11:47,840
that at that.
This x fans party I went to and the guys

272
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,250
were selling it and was like,
I'm no doctor.

273
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:49,820
I'm like,
yeah,

274
00:11:49,821 --> 00:11:54,821
what's in this?
And I was looking through it and it was 

275
00:11:54,821 --> 00:11:54,821
probably 300 different

276
00:11:54,821 --> 00:11:59,320
routes in like fucking bird tiers in 
Agora Shit that works,

277
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:07,430
you know,
because all those routes and shared 

278
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:07,430
those aren't going to work on a 60 year 
old dick.

279
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:07,430
You know,
all you know,

280
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:12,460
taking your fucking Gingko Biloba.
That's not going to give you a boner 

281
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:12,460
when you're 80,
you know.

282
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,740
But viagara will fucking rocket via 
grower will rock it.

283
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,450
Ever taken phrase 72 when he tells me 
the stories,

284
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:24,451
how he's banging this shit out of 
fucking stays home Sunday through.

285
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:29,170
He walks a refund park every morning for
miles that he goes home,

286
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,300
eats Viagara,
buxom chick the debt.

287
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,100
Wow.
That's like a 30 year old chicken.

288
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,360
He was driving.
He goes back and remember Brian Holtzman

289
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,720
rubbed by Agra because now these young 
girls that go out with these old rich 

290
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,211
guys,
they have to fuck them now for that 

291
00:12:51,211 --> 00:12:53,320
video and his load,
his load.

292
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:57,070
It's like paint that's been sitting in 
your basement for a year.

293
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,230
It's not a fresh product.
Ladies and gentlemen,

294
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,960
Remember that?
Remember that bit?

295
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,280
Brian Holtzman,
Brian Holtzman,

296
00:13:03,281 --> 00:13:08,281
ladies and gentlemen is probably one of 
the funniest guys that unfortunately 

297
00:13:08,281 --> 00:13:10,240
you're not going to hear up.
Are you not going to see on TV?

298
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:12,070
You're not going to see them as special.
I hope you do.

299
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,280
Unless you get it at the comedy store.
Does he still even go there?

300
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:20,281
I heard factory.
Unless it gives you a ticket with a 

301
00:13:20,281 --> 00:13:20,281
little beach,
right?

302
00:13:20,281 --> 00:13:24,130
Fucking guy that was in a parking meter.
Maid combination dog catcher.

303
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,380
Which.
How funny is he is a fucking dog.

304
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,450
He's a goddamn reality show waiting to 
happen.

305
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:33,910
Someone follow him around.
He's the meter man dog catcher and he's 

306
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,550
Brian Holtzman,
one of the funniest comics streak,

307
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,580
and you give him a fucking a camera in 
front of him and Mike and mom.

308
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,730
That's a great reality.
Show somebody out there act on this.

309
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,390
Can you get ahold of Brian Haltzman?
But Brian ultimate is like,

310
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,400
well,
there's only a few guys like that that 

311
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:50,400
you meet in your life.
And you go,

312
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:50,400
Oh man,
this motherfucker like what?

313
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,790
What happened?
Like,

314
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,680
why didn't,
why didn't anybody see this?

315
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:56,320
Why he's so good.
Why doesn't anybody see that?

316
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,780
You know,
like brody Stevens is another one.

317
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,540
Brody's got some stuff going on.
He was in the hangover and you know,

318
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,580
he's got good friends that are really 
funny.

319
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:08,581
Guys respect him,
but fruit is should be a national 

320
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,090
headliner.
He should be fucking killing it all over

321
00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:15,091
the country.
People should be like buying tickets to 

322
00:14:15,091 --> 00:14:16,870
see him in advance and looking forward 
to getting fired up at Brody's in town.

323
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,520
But you know what,
the weird thing about brody Stevens,

324
00:14:18,521 --> 00:14:23,521
I almost don't want him to get that 
famous because I love just watching 

325
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:26,710
Chelsea lately and seen like 
miscellaneous parts in the movie,

326
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:28,240
the hangover and stuff like that.

327
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,870
It's like kind of like a hidden game.
Like find brody Stevens out of nowhere.

328
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:33,250
No,
no,

329
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:33,770
no.
I know.

330
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,090
I obviously,
I don't mean to,

331
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,420
it's kind of Nice.
Kind of cool.

332
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,020
Only knowing who he is at the store 
lately.

333
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,440
He hasn't been getting spots when we get
the man show.

334
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:49,240
Brody was the warmup guy and his warmups
were so fucking funny.

335
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,290
You can tell the same joke 10 times in a
row and I,

336
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,470
I'll ask for it,
you know,

337
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,080
I'll keep you on out.
Did you do any modeling?

338
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,600
And it'll,
it'll do his whole fucking.

339
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:01,570
That whole piece that he doesn't bottle 
in Beirut,

340
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:06,560
Pakistan on the cover of camel beach.
Enjoy it.

341
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,690
What's ready?
Stevens at twitter name.

342
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:10,430
We just throwing that out.
Brody's.

343
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,150
Brody's friends.
Yeah.

344
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,990
I'm brody's brody's friend.
Follow this guy.

345
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:22,070
This guy is quite the,
but he's a fucking great human being.

346
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:27,350
At least like six in the morning and he 
has the cutest dog that has the most 

347
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,780
human face I've ever seen in my life or 
this is so hilarious.

348
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,850
Let me go back to Seattle with brody 
brody when they used to drive his car to

349
00:15:35,221 --> 00:15:38,250
the Gig harbor and he used to cry that 
was speeding in this car.

350
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:44,230
Tell us a classic brody story.
We put them in the truck and drove to 

351
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:47,321
Gig harbor.
He told me they would take them two 

352
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:47,321
hours and I said,
I'll bet you any amount of money I could

353
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:47,321
do it.
Not when.

354
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,200
He's like,
no you can't.

355
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,560
And we put them in the backseat with 
soundgarden blast and they kept saying,

356
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,860
global people don't live like this.
I'm doing fucking right hand lane,

357
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,880
cutting off.
He's like,

358
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,160
Stop Joe Diaz.
I would not want to be in the car with 

359
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,160
you.

360
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,570
Reckless driving.
If I was high,

361
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,600
that's tonight.
He stopped the show because there was a 

362
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,881
bunch of head shots on the wall and he 
stopped the show because there was no 

363
00:16:12,881 --> 00:16:14,760
Jews on the wall.
Not One fucking jewelry.

364
00:16:14,761 --> 00:16:17,000
That black people,
you got white people.

365
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:18,650
Whereas the Jews,
next time I come here,

366
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:23,651
I want a Jew on the wall.
Brody gets these bad late nights spots 

367
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:23,651
or at least he used to at the store and 
you know,

368
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:25,820
sometimes he'd get up there and the 
crowd would be dead.

369
00:16:25,821 --> 00:16:26,870
There'd be no one left,
like,

370
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,670
you know,
the show starts at 8:00

371
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,370
at night or something like that.
And Brody would be on like after 1:00

372
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,870
AM 1:45
or something like that.

373
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:35,570
He'd go on and he would just start 
playing the drums.

374
00:16:35,571 --> 00:16:40,571
He would pull chairs up and pull out as 
drumsticks and start playing the drums 

375
00:16:40,571 --> 00:16:41,210
and just start ad libbing and fucking 
around.

376
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:41,870
And before,
you know,

377
00:16:41,871 --> 00:16:44,420
you had a fucking show showed there was 
eight people there,

378
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,340
but that,
that was all rock and eight,

379
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,750
you know.
And that's,

380
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:52,780
that's one thing that,
that creepy place was the best best 

381
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:57,230
giving you those little tiny ass crowds,
those tiny ass crowds where there was no

382
00:16:57,231 --> 00:16:59,030
one in the audience and people barely 
paying attention.

383
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:03,800
But every now and then someone would go 
up and just do something magical in that

384
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,360
zero crowd.
Eight people was all I needed.

385
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,500
Let me tell you,
let me tell the story about you.

386
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:14,740
Joey Diaz.
One night we were at the comedy store 

387
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:14,740
and it's one of those nights where it 
was just,

388
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,461
it was kind of dead.
It was it a Sunday that when you went 

389
00:17:18,461 --> 00:17:21,291
to,
when you get onstage and you were doing 

390
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,931
the [inaudible] while I was a Saturday 
and the mainland and it was late at 

391
00:17:22,931 --> 00:17:22,931
night.
There was nobody.

392
00:17:22,931 --> 00:17:24,620
This is the early day.
There was the comedy store.

393
00:17:24,621 --> 00:17:27,950
Went through some dark periods where we 
got real bad crowds for a long time,

394
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:28,970
you know,
and this was.

395
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,130
This was like pre fear factor,
right?

396
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,410
This was a long time ago.
Yeah,

397
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,090
between this fact.
Okay.

398
00:17:35,091 --> 00:17:40,091
So.
So it's one of these late nights and 

399
00:17:40,091 --> 00:17:42,910
there's only maybe like fucking 
literally like five audience members 

400
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,880
left in this main room and joey goes 
onstage and Joe,

401
00:17:44,881 --> 00:17:49,881
he tells him to put up with at Wartburg,
tells him and he fucking

402
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:54,250
cranks war pig and Joey fucking sings 
along,

403
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:59,430
takes his shirt off and screaming into 
the microphone on key with every lyric 

404
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,540
and the place goes fucking bananas.
And Bananas.

405
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,810
I had to say it there because that's 
what it was.

406
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:12,811
Everybody was going nuts.
Everybody came in from the fucking 

407
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:15,450
kitchen.
All the comics that were still left in 

408
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,581
the.
Our came in to talk to you in the 

409
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:18,070
parking lot.
Came in by the time joey was offstage,

410
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,160
it went from 10 people to the only 30 
people that were in the whole fucking 

411
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,390
building.
And we were just clapping and laughing.

412
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,220
It was like,
there's these magical moments where,

413
00:18:27,221 --> 00:18:30,700
you know,
a dude just hit some rare place on stage

414
00:18:30,701 --> 00:18:34,780
where he's just free as fuck.
And that place,

415
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,870
that place at the comedy store.
There was so many of those moments.

416
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,230
When did you,
when you did it,

417
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:40,990
it was,
it was,

418
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,430
it was such the moment.

419
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,680
It was so real because there was no one 
there,

420
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,800
there was no one there.
It wasn't like you could see large 

421
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:49,800
audiences.
Sometimes you can trick them,

422
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,170
you can sing,
you know,

423
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,930
and sound like fucking,
you know,

424
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,300
some other singer and they,
they clap and they love you.

425
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,760
And in the end they give you a big 
standing ovation.

426
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,830
But it's really a bunch of dumb shit,
you know,

427
00:18:59,831 --> 00:19:02,560
you've just entertained them 
sufficiently,

428
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,990
but you're not going to get that kind of
response at all.

429
00:19:04,991 --> 00:19:07,480
Like five people when there's only five 
people there.

430
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,800
You've got to give them some real shit.
It's gonna to come from some crazy place

431
00:19:11,801 --> 00:19:14,560
inside you when there's like five or six
people.

432
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:19,561
There can be no fat in your act.
That's where your jokes sounds so gross 

433
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:22,170
and jokey.
They like all the unnecessary parts.

434
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:27,180
Your Act,
they just seemed so stupid because now 

435
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:27,180
you're only talking to a few people.

436
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,470
It teaches you.
That's one thing I give the comedy 

437
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,961
store.
I'll never take away from the comedy 

438
00:19:33,961 --> 00:19:33,961
store.
I never hit magical moments like that in

439
00:19:33,961 --> 00:19:38,371
another club.
The original room and the main room 

440
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:39,220
emphasis on the original room after 
midnight,

441
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:44,490
see a lot of comments.
She'll talk like I'm getting for 15 

442
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:47,071
spots.
Little do you know for a guy like me at 

443
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,180
1215 spot is a gold because I go in 
there and do what the fuck I want to do.

444
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,490
Which is really what comedy really isn't
a way.

445
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,080
You know?
It's unprepared.

446
00:19:53,081 --> 00:19:58,081
You go in there,
if you go up there with three of your 

447
00:19:58,081 --> 00:19:58,081
jokes about me and my girlfriend broke 
up,

448
00:19:58,081 --> 00:19:58,540
it's going to be a long,
15 minutes,

449
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:03,541
you know that,
and that's what the comedy store pull 

450
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:03,541
data.
You pulled that out to entertain for.

451
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,110
I love going up and that'd be four 
people.

452
00:20:05,111 --> 00:20:07,480
That's my world.
That's my fucking world.

453
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:13,260
Five hundred.
That's my world for five people on 

454
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:13,260
Tuesday nights,
somewhere at the sentence.

455
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:13,900
That's as fun as it gets.

456
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,230
Start laughing and rocking.
It's so genuine.

457
00:20:17,231 --> 00:20:19,300
You know?
Those moments are so genuine.

458
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,710
It's so.
There's no fat,

459
00:20:20,711 --> 00:20:21,910
no small crowds,
man.

460
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:27,420
It's a totally different style of comedy
and that's something I realized when I 

461
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,301
started doing larger venues.
Sometimes it's harder sometimes to get 

462
00:20:30,301 --> 00:20:34,040
you to be like one-on-one reel with a 
large venue because like you don't want 

463
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,800
to give them too much,
like dead air taught him.

464
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,420
You don't want to give them too much 
time to contemplate.

465
00:20:37,421 --> 00:20:42,421
There's too many people.
It's just too hard to control all of 

466
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:42,421
them anyway.
It's more,

467
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:43,090
it becomes more of like a show.
Whereas like if you're doing it for like

468
00:20:43,091 --> 00:20:48,091
just a few people,
there's something fucking crazy about 

469
00:20:48,091 --> 00:20:51,091
that man.
Every is dangerfield story where we did 

470
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:52,090
call me like four different guys did 
comedy for two people.

471
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,960
We were at dangerfield show as part 
started,

472
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,620
like,
you know,

473
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,620
8:00
or something like that.

474
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:00,190
My spot was at like 9:30.
I got there at 9:00

475
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,070
and everybody's just waiting in the bar.
I'm like,

476
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:03,730
what's going on?
Like,

477
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:04,900
no one's here.
No one,

478
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,220
no one,
no crowd at all.

479
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,770
Nothing.
So what do we do?

480
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,490
We leave now.
We're gonna wait for people to show up,

481
00:21:09,491 --> 00:21:11,080
see if nobody shows up.
So we went,

482
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:16,081
okay.
And were there for maybe 15 minutes and 

483
00:21:16,081 --> 00:21:18,230
a couple walks in.
And now there was a guy bobby who was 

484
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,310
the dorm and this big fucking 
powerlifting,

485
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:23,460
Scottish guy.
He was this guy who used to do power 

486
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,071
lifting with fucking bags of cement.
He would take bags of cement and pour 

487
00:21:26,071 --> 00:21:30,121
them into those big white plastic 
buckets and do fucking power lifting 

488
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:30,121
with them.
I mean,

489
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:30,121
it's just just,
uh,

490
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,370
a gorilla,
just a gorilla of a man in a crazy sense

491
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:38,371
of humor.
So the people who've probably way 

492
00:21:38,371 --> 00:21:40,861
funnier than 99 percent of the comedians
that ever worked at Dangerfield funnier 

493
00:21:40,861 --> 00:21:40,861
than me when I was a kid for sure.

494
00:21:40,861 --> 00:21:41,820
I was like,
how come this guy is the doorman?

495
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,420
He's fucking hilarious.
And um,

496
00:21:43,421 --> 00:21:46,990
you know,
some Dildo to do stand up without a view

497
00:21:46,991 --> 00:21:48,100
of the world yet,
you know,

498
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:48,520
and,
and I'm,

499
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,170
I'm the one on stage.
So anyway,

500
00:21:50,171 --> 00:21:51,580
the,
the couple walks in and he goes,

501
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:54,070
come back this way,
ladies and gentleman shows up to stop,

502
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,880
you know,
it's crazy.

503
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:59,881
Scottish accent.
It's terrible impression of him by the 

504
00:21:59,881 --> 00:21:59,881
way,
pulls them down.

505
00:21:59,881 --> 00:22:00,100
System down to people like sitting in 
this room,

506
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:01,780
like we're by ourselves.
What's going on?

507
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,120
Ladies and gentlemen?
Welcome that danger fields,

508
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:09,360
please welcome your host.
And whoever the fuck the host and the 

509
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,581
host goes out there by himself and he 
does stand up for this couple and he 

510
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:12,400
does like 20 minutes and then he brings 
on the next act.

511
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:17,430
The next act is a half an hour.
Then it brings up the next act and he 

512
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:20,401
doesn't half an hour and then they 
brought on me and I did a half an hour 

513
00:22:20,401 --> 00:22:23,371
and I brought on until all these fucking
people sat there and watched a whole 

514
00:22:23,371 --> 00:22:24,370
comedy show,
just two people and they sat through the

515
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:24,700
whole thing.

516
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:28,330
They probably felt trapped,
but they probably had a blast too.

517
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,390
They had a blast event from a different.
There was some good comics.

518
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:36,930
There were some good comics that night.
Danger fields was a good place to work 

519
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:40,221
out.
It's very similar to the comedy store 

520
00:22:40,221 --> 00:22:40,221
and nobody was there that was going to 
watch you.

521
00:22:40,221 --> 00:22:40,221
There was no industry people there.
You know,

522
00:22:40,221 --> 00:22:42,760
danger fields is not where you're gonna 
meet your manager or your agent.

523
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:47,761
It's just weird little club that only 
the comics like because in a place like 

524
00:22:47,761 --> 00:22:51,781
the comedy store,
the good thing about like a lot of 

525
00:22:51,781 --> 00:22:51,781
people like,
well,

526
00:22:51,781 --> 00:22:51,781
industry won't come to the comedy store.
I'm like,

527
00:22:51,781 --> 00:22:54,760
well you don't.
You don't get this kind of a club.

528
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:58,360
This kind of an atmosphere.
If the agencies want to come here,

529
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,070
they don't want to come to this kind of 
place.

530
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,470
They want to come to the kind of place 
where they're taken care of.

531
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:07,680
It's very professional and the manager 
takes care of their tab and seats them 

532
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,970
and shake their hand and kiss their ass.
The comedy store never gave a fuck about

533
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,060
the agents.
They don't give a fuck about you.

534
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,780
You don't even get free tickets.
Fuck you.

535
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,940
And the only way they get free tickets 
have you call in.

536
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:16,300
You say,
Hey,

537
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:19,000
I need two tickets from my agent.
Then the agent gets free tickets.

538
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,190
If the agents on his own,
he's fucked.

539
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,790
You know you're going to have to pay 
costs 20 bucks and this guy over here,

540
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,100
he's going to take your money.
They,

541
00:23:26,101 --> 00:23:28,720
they don't do that in other clubs,
but because of that,

542
00:23:28,721 --> 00:23:32,620
that place was just this place where you
just saw wild shit.

543
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,380
I saw your deck there at least 100 
times.

544
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,610
There was at least a hundred times with 
Joe.

545
00:23:37,611 --> 00:23:42,611
He pulled his dick out as,
this is the way I got to tell this.

546
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:45,230
The first time,
girl,

547
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,020
what's her?
That's

548
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,100
what the fuck's her name?
A female comic or the one that sued on 

549
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,260
barrel name?
Judy.

550
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,750
Judy.
Judy can see it.

551
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,200
Okay,
so this is what happens.

552
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,330
She goes on to state,
we shouldn't have said her name.

553
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,570
She goes onstage.
So she's.

554
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,880
She's on stage and she's not doing very 
well and we're all barbecued.

555
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,240
We're high as fuck.
It's eight people.

556
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:08,050
It's a Monday night,
Monday night know there's nobody there.

557
00:24:08,051 --> 00:24:09,470
There's no one there.
It was a small crowd.

558
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:14,060
So she's on stage.
Joey goes into the back area.

559
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:18,440
There's like this backstage area that's 
like in the or the or is a small room.

560
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:23,441
It only seats about a buck 50,
but it does have a stage with a little 

561
00:24:23,441 --> 00:24:23,830
backstage area.
So Joey goes into the back stair,

562
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,120
Jj area.
He goes to the backstage area.

563
00:24:26,121 --> 00:24:31,121
It takes off all his clothes and he 
waits and so she's doing her act and 

564
00:24:31,121 --> 00:24:35,651
when she gets to her punchlines,
she hits the punchline and Joey opens 

565
00:24:35,651 --> 00:24:39,821
the curtains and shakes his dick and 
then closes them up real quick and the 

566
00:24:39,821 --> 00:24:43,271
people go crazy and you see this spark 
in her eye like working.

567
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,550
I can finally doing it.
Oh my God.

568
00:24:49,551 --> 00:24:51,180
Now I see what it's like.
I could do it all.

569
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,080
You could see her loosen up and get 
confident.

570
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,070
You could see her relax and every time 
she had a punchline,

571
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:02,080
joy would pop up in their current shakes
closer and the people were fucking just 

572
00:25:02,421 --> 00:25:06,230
stopping their feet laughing,
slapping their tables.

573
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:10,070
She'd never did know that you did that.
If she ever knew she never needed them,

574
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,400
we couldn't break her heart.
She thought that she was on the phone.

575
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,040
She had so much confidence.
The next time you remember the last,

576
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,740
the next time we saw her on stage at the
same jokes,

577
00:25:18,741 --> 00:25:20,780
just just didn't,
didn't work.

578
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,080
It was like the same day she had the 
magic that she had for one night and she

579
00:25:27,051 --> 00:25:29,180
didn't even know.
I wonder if she's like,

580
00:25:29,181 --> 00:25:31,320
thinking back to what she ate that 
night.

581
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:36,330
Like I got to eat the same food everyday
and she's been eating Heiko Baloney 

582
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:39,520
sandwiches for the last 20 years.
It's hard to talk shit about any booze 

583
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,131
now.
Funny because nobody's fighting in the 

584
00:25:42,131 --> 00:25:42,131
beginning.
You know?

585
00:25:42,131 --> 00:25:44,950
It's like how come some people figure 
out how to be funny and some people 

586
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:44,950
don't.
I mean,

587
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:45,950
funny is a strange thing.
There's some folks that,

588
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,570
you know,
they might be intelligent,

589
00:25:47,571 --> 00:25:50,660
they might be cooled and met with.
There's something about them that's just

590
00:25:50,661 --> 00:25:52,250
not funny,
you know?

591
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:55,100
And it's just that no matter how hard 
they try for whatever reason,

592
00:25:55,101 --> 00:26:00,101
it just doesn't seem to connect with.
I know guys who have been open Micros 

593
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:00,101
for 20 years.
Right.

594
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,300
You know those guys.
Yeah,

595
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,470
they're happy.
They're,

596
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:07,160
some of them,
some of them still can't figure out what

597
00:26:07,161 --> 00:26:09,470
the fuck it is,
you know,

598
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,470
it's been falling like really weird 
people on twitter.

599
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,520
Lately I've been falling Dexter's,
uh,

600
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,240
ex wife or I guess wife.
No,

601
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:18,750
spoiler alert.
But you know,

602
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:23,980
the main girl from Dexter on twitter.
It is so weird to follow somebody that 

603
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,840
you know was supposed to be dead or 
something or that's supposed to be like,

604
00:26:26,841 --> 00:26:28,760
oh my God,
it's going to be following our dexter is

605
00:26:28,761 --> 00:26:33,761
going to get pissed.
You know what he did to the neighbor,

606
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:36,140
you know,
but you know about that dude that Donnie

607
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:38,870
was dexter that dude up in British 
Columbia.

608
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,550
Really?
But wait,

609
00:26:39,551 --> 00:26:44,551
wait,
I haven't heard this giant crazy dexter 

610
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:44,730
fan and winded up committing a murder 
and getting caught for it.

611
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:49,850
I do feel like after watching that show 
so much that I find myself doing things 

612
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:50,130
like,
you know,

613
00:26:50,131 --> 00:26:50,540
like,
uh,

614
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,740
uh,
like I'm always thinking twice,

615
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:53,820
like,
what would my dad do?

616
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:54,270
You know?
I'm like,

617
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:54,860
wait a second,
I'm not,

618
00:26:54,861 --> 00:26:59,861
I'm just getting the mail you episodes 
on a fucking lie.

619
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:03,480
One shot stone.
That's psychologically,

620
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,340
that's a dark show.
Well,

621
00:27:05,341 --> 00:27:08,280
it's kind of Kinda weird.
Good though,

622
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:13,380
Huh?
The first season and now I can talk 

623
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:13,380
about it.
Uh,

624
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,060
I thought that John Lift goes season was
the best season.

625
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,150
Okay.
Maybe it was.

626
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:20,151
I mean,
when I said it was only based on the 

627
00:27:20,151 --> 00:27:22,341
very first episode that I saw,
granted I was getting a little tired of 

628
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:22,800
the whole.
Every week somebody gets murdered,

629
00:27:22,801 --> 00:27:27,801
thing for whatever is a formula to it 
that if you get caught with 20 minutes 

630
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:30,970
late,
20 minutes left in the show,

631
00:27:30,971 --> 00:27:31,920
who's going to kill?
Well,

632
00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:32,670
you know,
I tell you what,

633
00:27:32,671 --> 00:27:34,130
that whole,
the smiths,

634
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,580
third season,
whatever his name is,

635
00:27:35,581 --> 00:27:38,130
Jimmy Smith or whatever his name is,
Don thought that was the worst season.

636
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:39,320
I hated that.
So yeah,

637
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:42,370
I did not like that season in mind.
It wasn't the best.

638
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,770
The best season was the first one.

639
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,510
The first one was,
first of all,

640
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:50,511
the first one was a motherfucker because
I understand the guy got sick and you 

641
00:27:50,511 --> 00:27:51,090
know,
and he had some health problems,

642
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,670
but the first one he looked like a 
killer.

643
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:58,671
Like he was built.
I didn't buy him when he lost all that 

644
00:27:58,671 --> 00:27:58,671
muscle.
I mean,

645
00:27:58,671 --> 00:27:59,370
I know it sounds silly,
but I just,

646
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,670
I'm like your Jujitsu and people and you
look like a skinny athletic.

647
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,610
I never even thought he had muscle to 
begin with.

648
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,640
If you look at the first one,
you know what it looks like to me,

649
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,970
like there's dudes that you go to 
Jujitsu with and you see him and they're

650
00:28:11,971 --> 00:28:13,020
like purple belts or something like 
that,

651
00:28:13,021 --> 00:28:15,240
and you look at me like this fucking guy
is going to be a pain in the ass.

652
00:28:15,241 --> 00:28:17,640
It's going to be hard to roll with this.
It's got like a big neck,

653
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:18,770
strong shoulders.

654
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:19,920
I'm like,
this is going to be a battle.

655
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:24,950
You just look at them.
That's kind of what he looked like in 

656
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:27,351
the first season.
It looked like a dude who's like a 

657
00:28:27,351 --> 00:28:27,351
sturdy dude,
you know?

658
00:28:27,351 --> 00:28:28,560
I bought that.
He was like this killer that he made him

659
00:28:28,561 --> 00:28:31,170
look just a little more sinister.
Even though he was polite.

660
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:36,350
He looked so much like a victim yet,
but maybe that's why they picked 

661
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:36,350
Jonathan Lithgo because they're like,
oh,

662
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,790
he could be him.
Here's my problem and this is.

663
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,960
I mean,
granted,

664
00:28:39,961 --> 00:28:42,060
I'm a commentator for fucking cage 
fighting,

665
00:28:42,061 --> 00:28:45,200
but when John Lithgo caught her in that 
weak ass rear naked choke,

666
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,710
I was like,
you ain't cook put.

667
00:28:46,711 --> 00:28:48,230
Nobody's hit that bitch.
You knew.

668
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,490
It's so funny and in the fucking chick 
with a bronc people bought,

669
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,880
they don't just lay there and accept the
fact you're choking him.

670
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,780
I try not.

671
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:57,210
Let me tell you something.
My daughter who she's just fucking to.

672
00:28:57,211 --> 00:28:58,950
Okay,
she's 30 pounds.

673
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,780
She had something stuck in her nose last
night.

674
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:01,740
All right,
and it was a.

675
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:06,770
She shed a little Barbie doll shoe and 
she fucking shove it up her nose and it 

676
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:10,581
was like upper nose and she was pulling 
at it and I had a hold her down and get 

677
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:14,091
it out of her nose and do.
She's fucking 30 pounds and she's 

678
00:29:14,091 --> 00:29:17,961
screaming and freaking and kick in and I
can barely get a hold of her nose and 

679
00:29:18,811 --> 00:29:21,650
hold her little tiny head to pull this 
thing out there.

680
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,580
John with NGOs.
Got some woman,

681
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:28,700
a grown ass woman who knows some crazy 
man's about to fuck her dead body and 

682
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:30,180
she's just going to go,
oh my God,

683
00:29:30,181 --> 00:29:32,400
you're putting me to sleep.
Shut the fuck up,

684
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,580
right?
Take that crap.

685
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:37,260
The actor have grabbed the act and just 
hold them down.

686
00:29:37,261 --> 00:29:39,540
Just start smacking him in the face.
Get up,

687
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,680
get up,
get up,

688
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,830
have them fucking freak out

689
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,850
thinking you're gonna.
Die Like you.

690
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,840
You might die in this.
I might not ever let you up you.

691
00:29:46,841 --> 00:29:48,970
Fuck,
I might just beat the fuck out of you to

692
00:29:48,971 --> 00:29:51,070
death right here.
And there's nothing you can do about it.

693
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,830
But that's how you feel when someone is 
choking you to death in a bathtub.

694
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,680
You don't just always got me.
That was stupid.

695
00:29:56,681 --> 00:29:59,470
You know what though is like,
it's so funny because while I'm watching

696
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:01,690
it doing John Lithgo doing these moves 
and stuff,

697
00:30:01,691 --> 00:30:04,390
I'm like thinking of you watching this 
and they're like,

698
00:30:04,391 --> 00:30:05,140
ah,
you know,

699
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,000
Joseph's getting pissed right now.
No,

700
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,020
but we're so pleased that you get so mad
about just the,

701
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:13,360
that the choke.
But I can't buy that fucking cell phone.

702
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:15,000
It looks like it was made in paintbrush,
you know,

703
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:20,001
like incoming call.
Where are you at when you look at the 

704
00:30:20,001 --> 00:30:20,110
graphics?

705
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,290
You know,
there's no fried.

706
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:26,540
Makes that crap.
So tech cell tech is not a real phone 

707
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:29,140
company.
That's hilarious.

708
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,400
I just,
you know,

709
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,140
to me that that scene where he kills a 
woman,

710
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:38,150
the tub is just as unrealistic as spock 
grabbing people by the neck and putting 

711
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:40,140
them asleep.
That's just just like a Ninja deft touch

712
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:45,180
to me.
People freaked the fuck out when you're 

713
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:45,180
choking them.
Okay.

714
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:45,700
They hyperventilate.
They kick,

715
00:30:45,701 --> 00:30:47,900
they spazz.
That's a,

716
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:52,000
that's made by someone who's never seen 
anybody get choked and the guy was doing

717
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:54,120
it to never choked anybody and there was
no girls.

718
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:57,760
Never been a show that nobody should 
have been freaking the fuck out.

719
00:30:57,761 --> 00:31:00,310
You don't just choke someone like that.
They go crazy,

720
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,810
right?
I try to survive.

721
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:06,850
You're gonna fucking bathtub with a 
naked old dude is behind you and you 

722
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,830
just kinda just.
You would bite that motherfucker.

723
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,720
You'd be fighting for your life.
At that point.

724
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:15,780
I would be more believable that he would
move his blood samples out of the air 

725
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:15,850
conditioning unit.
After the first,

726
00:31:15,851 --> 00:31:16,540
second,
third,

727
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,330
or fourth time,
the.

728
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,000
I'm thinking more of Shit like that.
I'm like,

729
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,120
come on,
you take your fucking blood samples that

730
00:31:21,121 --> 00:31:24,520
you put underneath the toilet or 
something like that.

731
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,190
Little thing that evidence the little 
thing that he,

732
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,370
you know,
the trophies didn't need that,

733
00:31:29,371 --> 00:31:31,270
but I guess that's a thing that serial 
killers do though,

734
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:31,690
right?
Yeah,

735
00:31:31,691 --> 00:31:32,920
I agree.
But you know,

736
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:38,070
I look at a show like that,
but then your last week Eddie said that 

737
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,370
he liked trueblood and and I just get so
angry.

738
00:31:39,371 --> 00:31:42,520
I've been fighting people off twitter 
all week about true blood lovers.

739
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,030
Another goddamn vampire show.
How many vampire shows are there now?

740
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,500
There's a new one.
There's a new one.

741
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,880
Nigga.
What the fuck?

742
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,540
What happened to the black shirt with 
the fucking thing?

743
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:57,770
What happened to the thing that they 
hypnotize you with that just fuck all 

744
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:57,770
evolved.
That it.

745
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,640
No Gate and no nothing.
They show up with that.

746
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,440
Robert Patterson looks like he's been 
getting punched in the nose.

747
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,810
The other fucking kid and the chicken.
I don't know.

748
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,580
Even play the vampire.
Fucking go there.

749
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,600
I don't go halfway there.
My wife watches true.

750
00:32:10,601 --> 00:32:11,740
What?
I leave the fucking house.

751
00:32:11,741 --> 00:32:14,110
You understand me on Sunday nights?
I don't like that shit.

752
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,450
I don't know where it came from.
It just snuck up on us,

753
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:21,451
like fucking brings you out of a swarm 
of vampire show.

754
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:26,630
No show.
Everybody's got a show about the and I 

755
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:26,630
don't listen,
but I don't know.

756
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,070
There's.
What's that other popular show with kids

757
00:32:30,071 --> 00:32:31,420
right now?
There's another vampire show,

758
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,430
vampire diaries,
her diaries.

759
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,930
That one.
What the fuck?

760
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,120
Then there's another one that's just 
about to start.

761
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,010
That's brand new.
That's coming out soon.

762
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:42,230
Can you have too many fucking vet?
Will there be a bounce back?

763
00:32:42,231 --> 00:32:47,231
Can we expect?
I don't know because there's people in 

764
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:47,231
the chat room.
They're saying,

765
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:47,231
dude,
true blood is legit.

766
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:51,610
You know,
they just don't get what I'm talking 

767
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:55,420
about.
Just the fact that there's a chat room 

768
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:58,241
of people talking about right there that
destroys my life is too God damn easy.

769
00:33:00,951 --> 00:33:03,570
People are soft as fuck.
They are soft.

770
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,720
Some are people are fucking soft and 
they're not even interesting.

771
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:10,530
Fucking vampires.
That's safety.

772
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:12,590
They have no character.
Well,

773
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,120
they don't have anybody.
They live off La Luis,

774
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:20,150
the twilight ones.
He lives off animals and he can go 

775
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:20,330
outside in the daytime.
What?

776
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,200
You knew,
what they've done.

777
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:22,880
They've pretty much taken this soap 
opera,

778
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:23,690
a dying thing.

779
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,580
They've taken off the evil guy with the 
patch,

780
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:30,640
made him a vampire and that's what the 
shows you guys are watching his fucking 

781
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,700
soap operas with Vampires.
So guys,

782
00:33:31,701 --> 00:33:32,960
I'm not gonna lie to you.
What?

783
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:35,440
I bought the fucking movie with Wesley 
Snipes.

784
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:40,450
Spade a spade a spade.
Limited speed.

785
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:49,990
Wasn't a name for a black guy.
Wouldn't be nearly as where he met with 

786
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:50,090
the Chinese people.
I bought that shit.

787
00:33:50,091 --> 00:33:51,310
I was like those Chinese.
Oh,

788
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,640
a huge bleed.
I was a big blow.

789
00:33:53,641 --> 00:33:55,310
I love as a kid,
but that's it.

790
00:33:55,311 --> 00:33:57,830
That's where it ends.
I don't want to see all this new shit.

791
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:01,050
Guys were arrested in hand.
True blood that a vampire.

792
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,840
That's bullshit.
I don't like.

793
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:04,620
That shit scares me.
I don't fuck me.

794
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:05,660
I was a kid.
Yeah.

795
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:10,680
Glade was my.
One of my favorite comic book 

796
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:10,680
characters.
That was a bad.

797
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,590
It was black and he used to have little 
knives made out of teak wood.

798
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:19,830
He would kill people with teeth because 
they were all vampires would kill them 

799
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:22,771
with wood.
So we had wood knives made out of is 

800
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:22,771
really hard.

801
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:23,390
I love that.
Everything else I got to tell you guys,

802
00:34:23,391 --> 00:34:25,430
I don't even go and fucking put this 
shit on.

803
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:27,800
They change so much about the whole 
vampire lore.

804
00:34:27,801 --> 00:34:32,801
I mean the whole thing.
What the fuck happened to Transylvanian 

805
00:34:32,801 --> 00:34:35,150
out Seattle now?
But I want to see where the fuck the APP

806
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,520
for the iphone is.
The fucking Transylvania.

807
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,120
When I was a kid,
you want to see a vampire?

808
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:44,140
We to go to transport rating.
Now they don't even talk about fucking 

809
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,350
Transylvania just disappeared.
Go look it up.

810
00:34:45,351 --> 00:34:50,351
Fucking Transylvania.
What the fuck is it's people like they 

811
00:34:50,351 --> 00:34:52,490
had an accent and shit like that where 
they'll from Bulgaria.

812
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,260
All of a sudden now they're fucking 
Spanish.

813
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:56,870
So if I was a smart man,
everyone should like bet money.

814
00:34:56,871 --> 00:34:58,830
What the next monster is going to be.
You know,

815
00:34:58,831 --> 00:35:01,340
it's like it's not going to be vampires.
What's the next thing?

816
00:35:01,341 --> 00:35:03,420
And Big Foot's going to come back and 
make a comeback or.

817
00:35:03,421 --> 00:35:04,760
So there's another

818
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,360
vampire thing by Google Eramo del Toro.
I don't know how to say his name,

819
00:35:09,361 --> 00:35:12,150
how you say his name is Guillermo del 
Toro.

820
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,490
He wrote a book called the strain and I 
saw,

821
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,770
I read the book.
It wasn't that good.

822
00:35:16,771 --> 00:35:18,840
It started off really good.
It started off like,

823
00:35:18,841 --> 00:35:20,610
wow,
this is a crazy ass vampire movie.

824
00:35:20,611 --> 00:35:25,611
Like this is like really suspenseful.
But then towards the end it was almost 

825
00:35:25,611 --> 00:35:25,710
like he was just trying to finish it.
It's like,

826
00:35:25,711 --> 00:35:27,240
you know,
and then the guy jumps out of the car,

827
00:35:27,241 --> 00:35:28,200
the guy killed him.
It was like,

828
00:35:28,201 --> 00:35:30,570
it was really bad.
The end towards the end,

829
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,600
like it's almost like he was trying to 
jam a six series book or a two or three 

830
00:35:35,731 --> 00:35:38,100
series book rather into one book.
So

831
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,120
it,
it dies,

832
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,860
but they're,
they're going to do something with that.

833
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:43,890
They're going to make that some sort of 
a big event,

834
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:46,380
but at least he's a murderous evil 
fucking vampire.

835
00:35:46,381 --> 00:35:48,360
And He.
And then he runs,

836
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,370
you know,
like takes over New York City.

837
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:55,520
It's pretty crazy shit,
but it just ends bad and maybe if they 

838
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,420
can fix the ending,
but the in the writing in the script and

839
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:59,700
it maybe it was creatively directed and 
they did a good job with it,

840
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:02,490
but the writing was just.
It was kind of clumsy at the end,

841
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:03,630
but what?
What?

842
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:08,631
What is it about people that are fucking
obsessed with vampires and all the 

843
00:36:08,631 --> 00:36:09,300
animal,
all monsters,

844
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:11,100
all the things to be worried about in 
the world.

845
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,690
Why would it be vampire?
It's none of the obsessed.

846
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,290
It's the hot thing right now.
In two years,

847
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:17,850
this vampire then will be gone.

848
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,880
Twilight.
Those two fucking half of fags will be 

849
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:22,880
dead somewhere.
I'm telling you,

850
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,751
I think it's going to keep going.
You know why I think it's going to keep 

851
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:26,751
going.
Sex in the city.

852
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,770
I didn't understand sex and the city.
I couldn't believe that.

853
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:30,540
I mean,
I watched it a couple times.

854
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:30,870
I'm like,
yeah,

855
00:36:30,871 --> 00:36:34,860
it's kind of a cool show,
but it's not just that people like it,

856
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:37,940
but they go fucking crazy for it.
Grills,

857
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:42,360
they respond to it like it.
It resonates in them in a way that a guy

858
00:36:42,361 --> 00:36:43,670
can understand,
you know,

859
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,890
took out like Uri,
you watching.

860
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,420
Oh,
that's funny.

861
00:36:45,421 --> 00:36:48,060
Show.
But to them it's like a movement.

862
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:51,150
It's like something that validates them.
Like this fucking movie.

863
00:36:51,151 --> 00:36:51,840
The,
the last one,

864
00:36:51,841 --> 00:36:56,841
when they went to Dubai,
I saw more people get fired up about 

865
00:36:56,841 --> 00:36:56,970
going to city.
No,

866
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,120
you sought though,
right?

867
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,900
We talked about.
That was a terrible bad.

868
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:05,901
It wasn't bad.
The first one on cable when the second 

869
00:37:05,901 --> 00:37:06,540
one came,
I was in the hotel room.

870
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,610
You know,
it wasn't back.

871
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,240
I think with that is when we talked 
about it for two hours.

872
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,480
That's the kind of resonating to 
entertainment for women.

873
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:20,810
Okay.
That twilight is for like young girls 

874
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:24,320
and young girls.
Young girls were in their thirties or 

875
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,230
forties or there's a romantic aspect to 
the vampires that,

876
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,470
you know,
there's something in the writing.

877
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,460
Know how we can do it.
We can.

878
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,520
We can kill vampires today guys.
We make a movie about vampires that 

879
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,260
cheat guys.
Empires are cheaters.

880
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,940
That'll be an asshole.
I don't.

881
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:41,550
I never watch TV and they suck.
What is,

882
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:46,610
what is the suck blood?
What the whole thing of of twilight.

883
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:51,740
I don't say this,
there's a family of vampires and they 

884
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:51,740
try not to eat people because they're 
nice,

885
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,380
but why are the women in love with them 
is because they're super.

886
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:59,620
He's super romantic.
Like the read the book is all about him 

887
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,000
being.
He's really romantic.

888
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:05,420
You know?
He's this guy that lived hundreds of 

889
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:05,420
years ago.
Meanwhile he's a fucking Pedo is banging

890
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:09,110
some high school chick.
How the whole thing is kind of creepy 

891
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:11,690
when you think about it.
I mean the guy's fucking 300 years old 

892
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:11,690
and he's hanging out with some 17 year 
old trick.

893
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:15,600
What the fuck do you have to say to a 
chick was 17 when you're 300 chicken.

894
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:17,170
That movie.
What I'm saying?

895
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,580
I think that the biggest problem that 
does movies,

896
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:25,581
it's the chick though.
She chose somebody that's dead instead 

897
00:38:25,581 --> 00:38:25,581
of somebody that just turns into a dog 
once in a while,

898
00:38:25,581 --> 00:38:27,510
but he's alive.
Can you imagine that chick was trying to

899
00:38:27,511 --> 00:38:29,580
talk to you about some stupid new song 
that was out like,

900
00:38:29,581 --> 00:38:30,540
oh my God,
I love this song.

901
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,440
He'd be like,
bitch,

902
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,680
I was around when they didn't have cars.

903
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:40,110
Do you understand that?
There was no photographs when I was 

904
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:40,410
born.
How the fuck yeah,

905
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:46,110
we used,
we used to find a way across oceans by 

906
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:48,040
staring at the stars.
What do you want to talk to me about?

907
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:49,210
You stupid.
Fuck.

908
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:54,570
He would just kill her in either.
He wouldn't be able to take that 

909
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,851
bullshit.
Three hundred year old man talking to a 

910
00:38:56,851 --> 00:38:56,851
17 year old girl.
Can.

911
00:38:56,851 --> 00:38:58,360
You're 44 years old.
Can you talk to a 17 year old fuck.

912
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,550
You could talk to her like she's a nice 
kid.

913
00:39:00,551 --> 00:39:05,551
Like,
so what do you want to do when you get 

914
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:05,551
out of college?
So what are you thinking about?

915
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:05,551
That sounds cool.
Oh Wow.

916
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,150
That's a child.
This guys banging her.

917
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:13,090
This is a stupid ass fucking movie.
It's the premise is absolutely 

918
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:17,251
completely ridiculous.
It would've been way better if it was a 

919
00:39:17,251 --> 00:39:17,251
grown woman like in her twenties or 
thirties or something.

920
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:19,060
Gets divorced,
branches out our own meats,

921
00:39:19,061 --> 00:39:22,630
a vampire falls in love that would work.
Just fucking high school check.

922
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:27,780
He's going to high school and he's 
banging a 17 year old and no one thinks 

923
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,330
that's crazy about the fact that he's 
evil.

924
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,330
He's interested in her.
She's fascinating to him.

925
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,870
It's a fucking baby.
It's a baby.

926
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:38,020
Imagine how young 17 year old girl is to
you.

927
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:43,021
Your 44.
What the fuck would it be if you were 

928
00:39:43,021 --> 00:39:43,021
300?
You know,

929
00:39:43,021 --> 00:39:47,470
I mean look like if I was 300 that 
motherfucking could speak Latin and he's

930
00:39:48,491 --> 00:39:50,380
talking to the interviewer 300 years 
old,

931
00:39:50,381 --> 00:39:52,300
you'd be fucking black chicks by then.
You know,

932
00:39:52,301 --> 00:39:54,330
you'd be done with the white race out 
there.

933
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:58,170
You'd be like,
you're getting the darkest black.

934
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,120
And does that happen with so many older 
Italian guys?

935
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,130
Oh,
like Deniro type guys.

936
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,670
Bill Maher's all black too.
They just go fuck like bitches.

937
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,560
I'm tired of it.
I'm tired of it.

938
00:40:11,561 --> 00:40:13,750
You don't want to get freaky.
Want to complain?

939
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:17,430
You don't want to shake that ass down 
for the party.

940
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,400
Get the fuck out.
Go,

941
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,210
go.
I'm done.

942
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,830
I'm done.
Alan fix all black too.

943
00:40:20,831 --> 00:40:24,250
I heard Alan Thick.
Alan thicke is a cool motherfucker.

944
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,070
Gets up on the side.
We had Alan thicke on.

945
00:40:27,071 --> 00:40:28,690
Um,
we had them on fear factor.

946
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,470
He did celebrity addition.
That dude is funny as fuck.

947
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,250
Smooth Professional.
Always got a smile on his face.

948
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:38,920
One liners just coming left and right.
Totally.

949
00:40:38,921 --> 00:40:43,921
Naturally I was getting delirious.
Hilarie will just say I was kidding 

950
00:40:43,921 --> 00:40:44,380
about the Alan thicke thing.
Oh,

951
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:47,850
you didn't make up something about this 
chick that went around the world.

952
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,010
The red filming.
Oh,

953
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:54,030
that poor little quit letting these 
stupid young chicks get it on rats just 

954
00:40:54,181 --> 00:40:55,330
cause they want to break records.

955
00:40:55,330 --> 00:41:00,010
There has to be laws against sabre.
They put it back on the boat and yeah,

956
00:41:00,011 --> 00:41:01,750
it's fucking retarded.
That's what,

957
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,580
that's what Farmville is for chick.
Well,

958
00:41:03,581 --> 00:41:04,330
you know what,
man,

959
00:41:04,331 --> 00:41:06,070
it's irresponsible over parents,
man.

960
00:41:06,071 --> 00:41:11,071
It just flat out is.
There's no way you can have your shit 

961
00:41:11,071 --> 00:41:12,190
totally together at 16 years of age.
There's no way you should be allowed.

962
00:41:12,191 --> 00:41:17,191
Not just out there living in an 
apartment by yourself or staying at a 

963
00:41:17,191 --> 00:41:19,610
hotel room by yourself unsupervised.
No.

964
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,330
You know,
you,

965
00:41:20,331 --> 00:41:23,410
you might be a little bit naive about 
the way the world works.

966
00:41:23,411 --> 00:41:24,940
You might not have ever been fucked 
over.

967
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,060
Might not truly understand like how 
deceptive people can be.

968
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:31,180
You shouldn't even let your 16 year old 
be by herself in a big city.

969
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,160
You're going to let her out in the 
ocean.

970
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,310
You crazy.
Fuck.

971
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,560
You're going to let her get on a boat 
now with this start.

972
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:39,130
It started raining.
Apparently like a really good boater.

973
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:39,830
Oh,
where?

974
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,460
What location?
I don't know it just counting county.

975
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:45,770
Where's she going now?
But I just want to know where it started

976
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:46,690
and where.
Find.

977
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:50,250
I was just looking at pictures of her.
I just want to know where it started.

978
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,500
Where it there?
What's it say?

979
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:52,400
What's the story?
Brian?

980
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,620
Sixteen year old girl.
Sixteen year old girl.

981
00:41:54,621 --> 00:41:55,950
Lost.
See?

982
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,750
See two words.
Two holes.

983
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,210
First one that hit.
Click on images and send.

984
00:42:09,211 --> 00:42:10,700
Let me know if there's a butthole.
Okay,

985
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,780
hold on.
By the way,

986
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:16,060
have you seen that Miley Cyrus?
We were talking about it.

987
00:42:16,061 --> 00:42:18,930
This is high level Internet Geek Shit 
that Brian is throwing at you.

988
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:24,350
Brian.
Probably does this with every story in 

989
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,220
the news and I just want to see searches
to get tickets.

990
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:29,250
The first buckle is someone will put up 
a goat c and attach it somehow with tags

991
00:42:29,251 --> 00:42:34,251
and it will be on Google images and 
he'll hack his way though the first 

992
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:37,071
position.
I absolutely know that will my girl 

993
00:42:37,071 --> 00:42:39,111
Miley Cyrus Felton was showing my miley 
Cyrus's Jj on his website.

994
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,560
There's a picture of it.
Someone took a picture of it,

995
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,020
I don't know.
Miley Cyrus was getting out of a car and

996
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:51,021
there was like a,
like a Britney Spears crotch shot and a 

997
00:42:51,021 --> 00:42:51,021
president put it on his website.

998
00:42:51,021 --> 00:42:54,270
He twittered it.
And then like a couple hours later,

999
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:57,510
the picture that was taken down from 
twit pic or whatever you put it up.

1000
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:01,110
Now the picture is fucking Vagina,
Maria,

1001
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,720
whatever her name is miley Cyrus's 
vagina.

1002
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:05,040
And people are saying,
you know,

1003
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:07,430
that's child porn,
just 17 and stuff like that.

1004
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:12,790
So then there was this whole movement 
showing that the other pictures from 

1005
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:12,790
that day,
uh,

1006
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:12,790
like,
you know,

1007
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,800
minutes or seconds before and it shows 
her having underwear on now a 

1008
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,770
[inaudible] went on his website saying 
today,

1009
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,690
hey,
that's not a real picture,

1010
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:22,290
blah,
blah blah.

1011
00:43:22,291 --> 00:43:23,520
It's been photo shopped,
blah,

1012
00:43:23,521 --> 00:43:24,450
blah blah.
Right,

1013
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:25,020
right.
So,

1014
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:27,060
but then you go to,
what would tyler durden do?

1015
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,340
WWT D,
D dot Com.

1016
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,520
And there's pictures of her from the 
same shoot where it doesn't show the 

1017
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:34,520
underwear.
Like,

1018
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:34,770
like you can't see the underwear 
anymore.

1019
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:36,190
So you think the underwear was supposed 
to sell it.

1020
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:41,270
Now it's doing that whole shit.
When Britney Spears at people did this 

1021
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:44,271
too.
They're fucking putting fake throws out 

1022
00:43:44,271 --> 00:43:46,050
to cover up fake or real photos or 
snopes or something grabs it.

1023
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:47,160
It looks at it and go,
oh,

1024
00:43:47,161 --> 00:43:51,420
that's not really her vagina.
It's probably love to do the opposite.

1025
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:54,300
It's presence people probably to.
Well they should be.

1026
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:55,600
He's pretty web savvy.
Ryan.

1027
00:43:55,601 --> 00:43:56,790
Him,
he owns a giant website.

1028
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:00,770
Even if you put up a photo of a fake 
vagina on a 17 year old,

1029
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,370
I believe it's illegal.
Absolutely.

1030
00:44:02,371 --> 00:44:04,980
It's illegal more.
That's why I'm on the board.

1031
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:10,010
The mods have pulled pictures down many 
times where it was a girls that even 

1032
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:11,790
just looked like they were under 18,
you know,

1033
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:14,100
because you don't want to get caught 
with that kind of shit.

1034
00:44:14,101 --> 00:44:15,240
Man.
That's some serious,

1035
00:44:15,241 --> 00:44:16,470
serious,
serious shit.

1036
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:21,680
Even just like a fake picture of a young
girl's pussy can get you locked up.

1037
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,130
You can read a lot of problems.
President's a fucking retard.

1038
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:30,300
When he used to make fun of Adam 
Sandler's kid and doing all that 

1039
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:30,300
bullshit,
that's just,

1040
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,020
you know,
he just needs to be shut up.

1041
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,040
Would benefit

1042
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:37,040
from three years in jail.
I think that's why that do beat him up 

1043
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:37,040
or the black eyed peas,
whatever.

1044
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,780
That's embarrassing and listening to 
them afterwards was so ridiculous.

1045
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:42,540
When you sit on the couch,
got violence is never the answer.

1046
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:44,130
Oh my God,
yes.

1047
00:44:44,131 --> 00:44:46,600
It is the fuck beat out of you.
You want to.

1048
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,780
You want to fuck with people.
People are going to hit you in the head.

1049
00:44:48,781 --> 00:44:53,781
Stupid.
The only thing that protects you from 

1050
00:44:53,781 --> 00:44:53,781
that as the law.
All right,

1051
00:44:53,781 --> 00:44:54,000
that's it.
Human beings want us.

1052
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:59,180
They want to pass that.
They want to just find a way around 

1053
00:44:59,180 --> 00:44:59,180
that.
They want to cause you pain.

1054
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:02,781
You know why?
Because you're putting out a lot of 

1055
00:45:02,781 --> 00:45:02,781
negative energy.
You know what?

1056
00:45:02,781 --> 00:45:03,810
I want to see Jonathan Lithgo and pres 
in a bathtub.

1057
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,820
Him choking him out from behind.
So I say that.

1058
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:07,260
Do you think that he would struggle?

1059
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:08,670
No,
I think even just let it go.

1060
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,010
Let it happen.
Do you think his butt hole would open up

1061
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:16,011
like a flower fleshlight and just lock a
hold of with cow's body and pull them 

1062
00:45:16,011 --> 00:45:19,791
into his asshole garbage disposal as 
bottles get fucking sharp teeth and 

1063
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:24,190
shit.
Hilton Bro.

1064
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,330
He is so fucking disgusting.
As a human being,

1065
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:32,340
I get that whole.
His whole site is set up to be mean to 

1066
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,500
people and some of it's funny.
I think some of what he says is funny,

1067
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:36,420
but I mean I think he could.
I mean,

1068
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:38,970
I think we could all benefit from a 
little less negativity in the world.

1069
00:45:38,971 --> 00:45:43,971
Let me say the negativity shit.
I buy the same dementia doesn't make me 

1070
00:45:43,971 --> 00:45:43,971
laugh.
You know,

1071
00:45:43,971 --> 00:45:46,430
when Shit's on people's kids being ugly 
or you know,

1072
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,520
call certain women,
ugly,

1073
00:45:47,521 --> 00:45:48,570
you know,
you don't like the way they look.

1074
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:53,580
Who gives a fuck you.
Unless you're saying something really 

1075
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:53,580
funny,
you know,

1076
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:53,580
you shouldn't,
shouldn't shit on him.

1077
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:58,011
Like that shit on things.
They can't control what they're fucking 

1078
00:45:58,011 --> 00:45:58,011
kids look like.
Like really?

1079
00:45:58,011 --> 00:45:58,260
That's just negative,
you know,

1080
00:45:58,261 --> 00:46:00,670
it's not.
And the people that enjoy that are cons.

1081
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:05,740
They're the people that don't feel bad 
when someone shitting on someone's kids 

1082
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:05,740
like,
whoa,

1083
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:09,591
really know because they're ugly man.
What was he saying about his kid is the 

1084
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,410
same as ugly and Blah Blah,
blah,

1085
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,760
and they can find a pallet.
She looked like a kid,

1086
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:15,880
not,
not Adam Sandler.

1087
00:46:15,881 --> 00:46:20,881
I think his kid,
he's probably had a lot of people fuck 

1088
00:46:20,881 --> 00:46:24,531
with him in his life and he's probably 
got a lot of pent up hostility if I 

1089
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:27,330
guess we'll wait to fucking rappers who 
don't get.

1090
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,020
That's what happened.
The willingham thing.

1091
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:31,920
They were so lucky that that was 
outside.

1092
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:32,750
Yeah,
but we'll,

1093
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:36,640
you know what I'm saying?
It was another one.

1094
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:38,440
It's because you know what?
He will,

1095
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,890
will I am said,
you know,

1096
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,670
I'm a fucking artist,
like respect me.

1097
00:46:41,671 --> 00:46:42,510
I'm an artist.
And he goes,

1098
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:44,850
you're not a fucking artist.
You're a fucking faggot.

1099
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,070
And someone went,
oh,

1100
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:50,230
no,
fucking hand came out of nowhere.

1101
00:46:50,231 --> 00:46:51,240
He clips him.
I mean,

1102
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:53,270
the dude barely got hit.
Okay?

1103
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,640
It was a scratch,
a tiny little square vial.

1104
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:57,930
It was nothing.
And he's screaming.

1105
00:46:57,931 --> 00:47:02,931
The next day mean it was like another 
version of leave Brittany alone.

1106
00:47:04,201 --> 00:47:05,580
It was so ridiculous.
It was like,

1107
00:47:05,581 --> 00:47:06,810
Dang.
I wonder if he was thinking like,

1108
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:11,870
Oh my God,
I'm idea this Brittany thing was he 

1109
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:15,570
believed in at one point in their life 
needs to get their ass kicked.

1110
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,960
You know,
I'd get my ass kicked all the time and 

1111
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:20,960
Jujitsu and I think that is very good 
for you.

1112
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,130
It's very humbling to get your ass 
kicked and when dudes have never 

1113
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:28,551
experienced the frustration and anger,
have another dude on them taken out in 

1114
00:47:28,551 --> 00:47:30,640
the physical.
If you never experienced that,

1115
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:32,320
you're going to talk a lot of stupid 
shit.

1116
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:34,540
You know you're going to get mean to 
people for no reason.

1117
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:36,460
You're not going to be civil when you 
can be.

1118
00:47:36,461 --> 00:47:39,820
You have the option to be a nice person 
and you're choosing not to be and you're

1119
00:47:39,821 --> 00:47:44,821
making it a pain in the ass for all the 
rest of us and someone's going to punch 

1120
00:47:44,821 --> 00:47:44,821
you in your fucking head.
Right?

1121
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,020
And if no one's around,
you're fucked.

1122
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:49,780
Okay.
If no one's around and they find you and

1123
00:47:49,781 --> 00:47:51,910
you've been mean to people for no 
fucking reason,

1124
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:57,120
talk shit on someone's kid,
they might kick you in the Dick or 

1125
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:57,400
they're going to cover their whole 
kitchen with plastic and when he's going

1126
00:47:57,401 --> 00:48:02,401
inside the kitchen,
he's going to come up from behind him 

1127
00:48:02,401 --> 00:48:02,401
with a syringe and the neck and he's 
going to wake up,

1128
00:48:02,401 --> 00:48:06,271
covered up and part of that movement 
where they say shit to you when you 

1129
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,320
smack them laid down nine one,
one.

1130
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,100
That's one thing in it though.
See,

1131
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:16,720
there's a living in it.
People enjoy it.

1132
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:19,510
They enjoy being shit and that's.
That's what the problem is.

1133
00:48:19,511 --> 00:48:22,540
The problem is that,
and I'm as guilty of it as anyone,

1134
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:27,541
I'm not.
I'm not saying that I'm above this in 

1135
00:48:27,541 --> 00:48:30,031
any way,
shape or form because I'm definitely 

1136
00:48:30,031 --> 00:48:30,031
not.
I'll go to those sites.

1137
00:48:30,031 --> 00:48:32,671
I'll go to,
I'll pick up US weekly if I'm taking a 

1138
00:48:32,671 --> 00:48:32,671
shit.
I've seen US weekly.

1139
00:48:32,671 --> 00:48:32,671
I'm like,
all right,

1140
00:48:32,671 --> 00:48:33,520
who's up?
Who's doing something mean?

1141
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,920
Who's who's an asshole?
Who's getting sued?

1142
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:36,440
You know,
I draw,

1143
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,080
come coming out of your mouth all the 
time.

1144
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,370
Oh,
how rude.

1145
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,890
But you know what I'm saying?
I mean,

1146
00:48:41,891 --> 00:48:43,720
it's just,
there's a,

1147
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:47,140
there's a part of us that likes,
likes getting upset at people.

1148
00:48:47,141 --> 00:48:52,141
There's a part of us that life's going 
to be how you fucking loser posted 

1149
00:48:52,141 --> 00:48:55,381
before there's a guy on twitter you 
posted before that I was going to come 

1150
00:48:55,381 --> 00:48:55,381
up.

1151
00:48:55,381 --> 00:48:56,980
Everybody put some nice stuff on that.
One.

1152
00:48:56,981 --> 00:48:57,880
Guys said,
fuck you.

1153
00:48:57,881 --> 00:48:58,990
Tbi.
You know,

1154
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:04,060
of course.
But what kills me is if you're going to 

1155
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:04,060
be a tough guy,
come out of the fucking live today.

1156
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:05,350
There's a million tough guys.
Well,

1157
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:10,410
there's a million fucking tough guys on 
the Internet and when you tell them to 

1158
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:10,890
go fuck that mother in the ass,
then you'll never hear from them again.

1159
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,730
Seattle fuck around.
I tell them exactly.

1160
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:15,090
Go light your mother's pussy on fire,
whatever.

1161
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:16,020
Then they don't bother me.
No.

1162
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:18,230
This stuff that I don't like,
stuff,

1163
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,950
I don't really fuck with it that much.
You know,

1164
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:26,400
I,
I got into it with a kid from my 

1165
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:26,400
hometown on facebook couple of weeks 
ago,

1166
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,720
a Bible breather 20 years ago.
I was stuck.

1167
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,760
He was selling me,
quite alludes that he's telling me that 

1168
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,570
I shouldn't curse on facebook a 
motherfuckers.

1169
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:38,580
I hate all that shit.
You want to hear some negativity in the 

1170
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:40,821
Internet.
This is a hilarious story and this 

1171
00:49:40,821 --> 00:49:42,751
happened this weekend.
I was in Vancouver for the UFC and 

1172
00:49:42,751 --> 00:49:47,230
apparently I got an elevator with some 
dude and the dude didn't say hi to me or

1173
00:49:47,231 --> 00:49:52,231
nothing,
but he said I gave him this look like I 

1174
00:49:52,231 --> 00:49:52,231
didn't like him or like a,
you know,

1175
00:49:52,231 --> 00:49:55,360
like back the fuck off look.
And then he says that.

1176
00:49:55,361 --> 00:50:00,361
He said take care guys.
And then we said nothing and then he 

1177
00:50:00,361 --> 00:50:01,210
left the elevator like wow,
Joe Rogan's a fucking hassle.

1178
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:06,330
So he goes online and makes us whole 
thread about me being in an elevator 

1179
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:07,990
with him and no conversation taking 
place at all,

1180
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:10,870
but me being an asshole like I'm giving 
him this look,

1181
00:50:10,871 --> 00:50:14,200
I think I'm a bad ass and I got short 
man syndrome and you know,

1182
00:50:14,201 --> 00:50:16,720
and then fucking I got problems with 
communicating with people.

1183
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,810
Like it was crazy shit and I'm like if I
saw you,

1184
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,210
if you said something to me,
anything,

1185
00:50:22,211 --> 00:50:23,710
if you said you know,
take care of,

1186
00:50:23,711 --> 00:50:24,940
I would have definitely said you too 
man.

1187
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:29,150
I always say that I not,
I could fucking hate you.

1188
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:31,460
And if you said take care man.
Have a good day.

1189
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:32,570
Bye Bye.
All right dude.

1190
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,000
Take it easy.
I would fucking respond to you.

1191
00:50:35,001 --> 00:50:37,940
I wouldn't just stand there stone faced.
Even if I fucking hated you,

1192
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,160
I would say something.
I'm not a mean person.

1193
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:41,810
I'm not the type of person that does 
shit like that.

1194
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:46,960
So it's either one or two things happen.
Either he said it and I didn't hear it 

1195
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,670
or I responded like our dude take care.
And he didn't hear that either one.

1196
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:51,680
And the dude was high,
those the other thing,

1197
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:54,890
so he was probably a little bit paranoid
and a little bit star struck,

1198
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:58,100
but he makes this crazy fucking thread 
and then I tell him,

1199
00:50:58,370 --> 00:50:58,960
you know,
I get on,

1200
00:50:59,030 --> 00:50:59,390
I said,
Hey,

1201
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:02,120
I'm sorry you had a bad experience,
but it was probably a misunderstanding.

1202
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:02,970
I'm,
I'm out.

1203
00:51:02,971 --> 00:51:04,700
I'm a nice guy.
If you're nice to me,

1204
00:51:04,701 --> 00:51:05,850
if you're not retarded,
you know,

1205
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:07,610
and you're cool to me,
I'm going to be holding you back.

1206
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:10,190
I tried to be cool to everybody.
Like it was just a misunderstanding.

1207
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:11,360
Well,
the threat.

1208
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:12,050
He says,
all right,

1209
00:51:12,051 --> 00:51:12,680
cool man.
Sorry.

1210
00:51:12,681 --> 00:51:13,430
No big deal.
Well,

1211
00:51:13,431 --> 00:51:16,370
the thread keeps going on and on and on,
and he keeps commenting on it,

1212
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,920
like it keeps going back to it and back 
to it.

1213
00:51:18,921 --> 00:51:21,010
Like I did something to them.
And then finally I come back,

1214
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:21,650
I go,
listen man,

1215
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:22,940
I go,
you're out of line.

1216
00:51:22,941 --> 00:51:24,050
I go,
nothing happened.

1217
00:51:24,051 --> 00:51:26,960
You're making this thread about a 
conversation that didn't take place.

1218
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:32,200
Do you understand?
We didn't even say a word to each other 

1219
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:32,200
like,
this is crazy.

1220
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:32,200
You're still going on about this.
And then he comes back,

1221
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:33,650
fuck you,
I'm out of line.

1222
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:35,280
You fucking piece of shit.
Wow.

1223
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:40,960
You fucking short man syndrome.
You're like one of those Chachi's 

1224
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,840
window's tight shirts.
And you walk around like you're fucking 

1225
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:43,840
crazy.
Is that.

1226
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,860
And I'm why you can't back down now.
You know he has like,

1227
00:51:45,861 --> 00:51:47,940
this was not easy.
Yeah.

1228
00:51:47,941 --> 00:51:49,340
You.
This is out of nowhere.

1229
00:51:49,341 --> 00:51:50,930
I'm going to.
I'm not saying anything negative.

1230
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,960
I'm saying he's out of line for other 
guys.

1231
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:55,990
Have you elevated with three other 
people?

1232
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,280
Me and Eddie Bauer.
Fuck,

1233
00:51:58,530 --> 00:51:59,330
is he.
Anyway,

1234
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:02,660
I'm on the phone on the way here.
I stopped.

1235
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:04,650
I've totally somebody.
And the next thing you know,

1236
00:52:04,651 --> 00:52:05,820
somebody comes up to me.
No,

1237
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,980
excuse me.
I would've never come up to somebody.

1238
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,810
But that's the little tread over here.
Your Joe Broken.

1239
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:13,610
So you have to say something.
I don't think he was that.

1240
00:52:13,611 --> 00:52:16,040
This is what I think it was.
I think he was a little high.

1241
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:18,290
It was a little paranoid.
And I think he's a little sensitive.

1242
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:20,690
And you know,
sometimes people think that people think

1243
00:52:20,691 --> 00:52:22,370
they're better than you and that fucking
sucks.

1244
00:52:22,371 --> 00:52:27,371
Nobody wants to be around some.
If I'm around someone like an actor or 

1245
00:52:27,371 --> 00:52:27,950
someone and they get Douchey,
I'll say something stupid to them,

1246
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:29,750
you know,
if I'm around some asshole actors,

1247
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,550
one of the reason why I don't like being
around actors,

1248
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:34,880
a lot of them play fucking games.
They say stupid shit to you.

1249
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:40,120
They said like,
I was on a set with this one guy once 

1250
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:40,120
and we were about to do the scene and 
uh,

1251
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:40,130
I'm just being cool with them like,
right.

1252
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,030
All right dude.
And he's about to walk away.

1253
00:52:42,031 --> 00:52:43,400
And he goes,
so you have almost no hair.

1254
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:44,300
And he walks away.
I go,

1255
00:52:44,301 --> 00:52:45,890
what?
What'd you say?

1256
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:50,950
Nothing.
And just walks away like he said 

1257
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:51,230
something to try to fuck with my head 
before I did the scene,

1258
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:55,070
like picking on my hair,
falling out to so and so.

1259
00:52:55,070 --> 00:53:00,070
Then I saw him the next day and I was 
still in my head and so he started to 

1260
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:01,780
try to fuck with me again and then I 
just,

1261
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:03,330
I just said something to him like,
dude,

1262
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,000
don't,
don't fucking get stupid with me,

1263
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:05,630
you know,
don't,

1264
00:53:05,631 --> 00:53:07,310
don't like play little insult games.
Me,

1265
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:12,430
I go,
you and I will never have a real 

1266
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:12,430
conversation ever again.
Right.

1267
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:12,430
You know why?
Because you're a fucking idiot.

1268
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:13,070
I was nice to you and you came with 
this.

1269
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:13,800
You,
you know,

1270
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:19,230
it wasn't like a joke.
It was like he said something like a 

1271
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:19,640
little slightly insulting thing and then
walked away.

1272
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,230
I mean,
you could say that like,

1273
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:22,220
dude,
your hair's falling out.

1274
00:53:22,221 --> 00:53:22,790
I'm like,
fuck you,

1275
00:53:22,791 --> 00:53:27,791
you ugly bitch.
You gotta mirror and there will be 

1276
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:27,791
joking with each other and we can be 
friends.

1277
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:28,470
But when I know that someone's trying to
fuck with me,

1278
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,610
like why are you doing that?

1279
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,980
This isn't funny.
Like you're trying to be shitty with me.

1280
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:36,000
That happens with actors all the time.
With actors,

1281
00:53:36,001 --> 00:53:38,940
you're always dealing with little 
psychological bullshit.

1282
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:44,210
They're all fucking tweaked out and 
freaked out because they don't create 

1283
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:47,421
anything.
They have to have someone come to them 

1284
00:53:47,421 --> 00:53:47,421
with scripts and ideas and pick them and
choose them.

1285
00:53:47,421 --> 00:53:52,250
It's like the only art form where 
somebody has to pick you so you can 

1286
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:52,250
perform,
you know?

1287
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:52,350
I mean,
if you're a fucking musician,

1288
00:53:52,351 --> 00:53:53,700
you,
you do your goddamn music,

1289
00:53:53,701 --> 00:53:55,230
you make your own shit.
Your comic,

1290
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:56,910
you write your own jokes.
If you're an actor,

1291
00:53:56,911 --> 00:53:59,190
you have to sit around and wait for 
someone to give you a role,

1292
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,530
you know?
I mean,

1293
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:05,540
you could.
I guess you could put together your own 

1294
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:05,540
shit and throw it up on youtube if you 
want to get crazy.

1295
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:08,840
I had,
I ran into something that goes along 

1296
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:08,840
this whole line at the same a couple of 
days ago.

1297
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:13,550
This guy I know wrote something to a 
friend of mine that was so fucked up 

1298
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,180
like,
and so I took a screenshot of it.

1299
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,820
He wrote,
you're a dirty fucking whore.

1300
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:22,850
Your tits look like shit.
Obviously you're desperate for 

1301
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:22,850
attention.
Get a light.

1302
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:24,570
Three minutes later he wrote,
you are so desperate for attention.

1303
00:54:24,571 --> 00:54:25,680
Your tits.
You Post.

1304
00:54:25,681 --> 00:54:27,960
Look like Shit,
you're a funny girl who is lonely,

1305
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:29,550
so this guy,
I'm like,

1306
00:54:29,551 --> 00:54:31,220
who the fuck is this guy?
And I'm like going.

1307
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:33,090
Somehow he has connections with opie and
Anthony,

1308
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,820
not really sure how yet,
but then I go through it and he has this

1309
00:54:35,821 --> 00:54:40,050
fucking envelope where has this full 
address and so dexter style,

1310
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:45,170
I googled his address,
fucking took a picture of his house and 

1311
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:45,360
on another twitter account,
send it to them and goes,

1312
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:49,240
that's a very rude thing to say.
Now he deleted all those photos,

1313
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:50,760
a post and stuff like that.

1314
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:57,990
His latest tweets I've been,
I feel really sick.

1315
00:54:57,991 --> 00:55:01,840
I've never been this sick in my life.
Instead you them the fuck out.

1316
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,970
It's so crazy because he has like his 
pictures and his whole twitter is a real

1317
00:55:05,971 --> 00:55:08,230
twitter and he's a family guy.
His daughter,

1318
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:13,240
he's a sign nothing.
How do you do this when you have a 

1319
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,711
daughter too?
So I'm really interested in finding out 

1320
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:15,711
what his connection to the open anthony 
show.

1321
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:17,220
It's because he has all these shots from
like in the studio with Jim Norton,

1322
00:55:17,221 --> 00:55:17,760
blah,
Blah Blah.

1323
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,480
Oh yeah.
You can find out you got pictures of him

1324
00:55:21,481 --> 00:55:22,110
and everything.
Oh yeah.

1325
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,280
I'm looking at it right now.
Okay.

1326
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:26,940
Well tell us what Jimmy will tell us.
Yeah.

1327
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,470
Wow.
Crazy people.

1328
00:55:28,471 --> 00:55:33,471
So this guy I got on afterwards and he 
goes back and forth and starts bringing 

1329
00:55:33,471 --> 00:55:37,941
up a video of me being an asshole to 
some guy from like nine years ago as 

1330
00:55:37,941 --> 00:55:37,950
proof that I'm a Douche bag.

1331
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:42,950
I'm like,
you're trying to distract from our 

1332
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:42,950
conversation.
Like we didn't have a conversation,

1333
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:43,440
right?
There was nothing.

1334
00:55:43,441 --> 00:55:45,450
Nothing took place and you've made this 
whole thread about it.

1335
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:49,230
Now you're screaming and swearing at me 
and insulting me like this is craziness.

1336
00:55:49,231 --> 00:55:54,231
Do you understand this?
And so he actually came on and 

1337
00:55:54,231 --> 00:55:54,270
apologized and then I came on and so 
it's all good,

1338
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,440
you know,
no harm done.

1339
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:59,190
It's just.
I think it sucks when the thread by this

1340
00:55:59,191 --> 00:56:01,860
time everyone's piling on.
Everyone is like,

1341
00:56:01,861 --> 00:56:04,410
you insecure a piece of shit.
Like what the fuck is wrong with you?

1342
00:56:04,411 --> 00:56:05,700
Like what are you crazy?
Like?

1343
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,560
So many people are saying the guy's 
crazy.

1344
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,510
And a few people say,
oh,

1345
00:56:09,511 --> 00:56:11,990
I met Joe Rogan introduce bag.
Some of them are like making up stories.

1346
00:56:11,991 --> 00:56:16,800
I just told us to sign my autograph,
which is just crazy horse shit.

1347
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:22,070
So anyway,
the dude he apologizes and I say it's 

1348
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:22,070
all good,
you know,

1349
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:24,100
I think that we all learn from a being 
criticized.

1350
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:29,670
It doesn't feel good to say people need 
to hear people say you suck at and to 

1351
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:29,670
hear people,
you know,

1352
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:31,510
call you piece of shit and criticize 
you.

1353
00:56:31,511 --> 00:56:36,511
But it's good because when you realize 
that you're having a negative effect on 

1354
00:56:36,511 --> 00:56:36,511
people,
it makes you think like,

1355
00:56:36,511 --> 00:56:38,890
what is this a fact that I'm not seeing.
I'm thinking I'm doing the right thing.

1356
00:56:38,891 --> 00:56:43,891
I'm thinking I'm living my life.
What am I doing that's making people so 

1357
00:56:43,891 --> 00:56:43,891
upset with me?
Like,

1358
00:56:43,891 --> 00:56:43,891
what is,
is it real now?

1359
00:56:43,891 --> 00:56:44,620
What is it?
Is it,

1360
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:47,440
is there is a jealousy issue,
is a,

1361
00:56:47,441 --> 00:56:49,730
as an Alpha male issue,
is it a,

1362
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:53,320
am I being too insensitive?
Like what is it?

1363
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:56,560
I think it sucks to admit that we all 
have like little,

1364
00:56:56,561 --> 00:57:01,561
little issues,
but being criticized like especially 

1365
00:57:01,561 --> 00:57:04,051
online,
I think it accelerates your social 

1366
00:57:04,051 --> 00:57:04,720
development because it makes you a 
little bit more aware of what a bunch of

1367
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:07,300
anonymous people really,
truly feel about what you say.

1368
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:12,940
No,
you don't get that too much in real 

1369
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:12,940
life,
in real life.

1370
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:16,411
You know?
There's a lot of people that especially 

1371
00:57:16,411 --> 00:57:16,411
like until the internet came around,
they were there know they could bullshit

1372
00:57:16,411 --> 00:57:17,080
their way through.
You know,

1373
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:22,110
you could bullshit your way and charm.
People be can't fucking charm anonymous 

1374
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:25,561
douche bags on the internet,
anonymous Douche bags and the Internet 

1375
00:57:25,561 --> 00:57:25,561
will go,
fuck you.

1376
00:57:25,561 --> 00:57:26,380
You fucking hack.
You suck.

1377
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:28,930
You know you're nothing.
You're a loser.

1378
00:57:28,931 --> 00:57:31,480
You're going to die like that.
Like they'll go after you,

1379
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:32,530
man.
They'll go after you,

1380
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:37,860
but you develop two things.
You want to develop a thick skin from 

1381
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:38,290
that were like,
it doesn't hurt anymore.

1382
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:39,500
Now it just feels weird.
It's like,

1383
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:44,510
what's this guy doing?
It doesn't make you do something like 

1384
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:45,890
that.
I hate you guys.

1385
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,830
Got To be something wrong with it.
Elevated with God.

1386
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:49,750
Having a good day,
guys,

1387
00:57:49,751 --> 00:57:50,590
it didn't hit me or whatever.

1388
00:57:50,590 --> 00:57:51,850
I get off,
I go home.

1389
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:54,160
It's like the people go to comedy clubs 
and write 11,

1390
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:59,430
saying that you would sell it though,
that you wrote a joke or you said 

1391
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:02,701
something on stage.
What would make you go home and write a 

1392
00:58:02,701 --> 00:58:03,490
fucking letter about your experience at 
a comedy club?

1393
00:58:03,491 --> 00:58:04,930
Or if somebody said,
well,

1394
00:58:04,931 --> 00:58:07,150
here's a lady that wrote a,
ever tell you the time to.

1395
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:09,430
The lady wrote about my retarded Jesus 
joke.

1396
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:13,660
Remember my retirement.
I had a joke about cloning because there

1397
00:58:13,661 --> 00:58:18,661
was a.
There was a group called the second 

1398
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,170
coming project and the second coming 
project they were going to take some DNA

1399
00:58:20,171 --> 00:58:25,171
from the shroud of Turin or some other 
religious artifacts and try to clone 

1400
00:58:25,171 --> 00:58:27,610
Jesus and they thought that that would 
be the bringing back of the Messiah.

1401
00:58:27,611 --> 00:58:32,611
That would be the second coming would 
actually be through science and that 

1402
00:58:32,611 --> 00:58:32,611
they would clone Jesus.

1403
00:58:32,611 --> 00:58:32,680
And so I,
I wrote this joke about,

1404
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:37,690
well cloning is not been perfected yet.
Like Dolly the sheep shed all sorts of 

1405
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:39,820
genetic issues and she died young and 
you know,

1406
00:58:39,821 --> 00:58:42,430
that was considered a success.
There's a lot of failures,

1407
00:58:42,431 --> 00:58:47,431
I'm sure that we never heard about.
They were like horrible genetic 

1408
00:58:47,431 --> 00:58:47,431
disasters.
Fucking monsters and shit.

1409
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:49,270
I'm like,
what if they clone Jesus?

1410
00:58:49,271 --> 00:58:54,271
And the first one comes out retarded.
I mean that's possible because that down

1411
00:58:54,351 --> 00:58:54,970
syndrome,
what do they do?

1412
00:58:54,971 --> 00:58:57,430
They kill it.
You start from scratch or.

1413
00:58:58,430 --> 00:59:00,100
Yeah,
maybe it's a test.

1414
00:59:00,101 --> 00:59:02,680
It's a test.
He's testing us instead of turning water

1415
00:59:02,681 --> 00:59:07,681
into wine.
He turned like dog shit in the cookies 

1416
00:59:07,681 --> 00:59:08,230
home thing where they were following 
Jesus everywhere.

1417
00:59:08,231 --> 00:59:10,510
He was like,
I want to go into the park today.

1418
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:12,380
They're like,
don't you think we should seal the hip,

1419
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:13,820
you know,
heal the sick or help.

1420
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:14,190
No,
no,

1421
00:59:14,191 --> 00:59:15,010
no.
The park.

1422
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:18,130
So they were all waiting for him to come
up with,

1423
00:59:18,131 --> 00:59:19,600
you know,
the fucking answer.

1424
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:20,280
Great.
Manatee.

1425
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:22,220
Well this woman got so mad.

1426
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,130
She gets so mad.
She wrote this fucking shoot.

1427
00:59:24,131 --> 00:59:25,700
This was.
I thought it was really funny about it.

1428
00:59:25,701 --> 00:59:29,570
She said not only did he tell this 
horrible job,

1429
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:34,600
but when the audience didn't respond,
he insisted on talking about the same 

1430
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:38,621
subject instead of moving on.
She was upset that I wouldn't move on.

1431
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:42,890
Like her version of comedy is you got to
do what the audience wants.

1432
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:48,040
Like you're not,
you're not supposed to be coming from 

1433
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:48,040
your own head.
You only do what they like,

1434
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:48,040
you know,
it's like,

1435
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:48,710
like you're,
you're a band.

1436
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,590
They can yell out,
you know,

1437
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:52,310
do hot for teacher.
Then you have to sing up for Dj,

1438
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:57,610
you know,
like I thought it was running and there 

1439
00:59:57,610 --> 01:00:00,401
was people that were laughing.
So that's the same woman that doesn't 

1440
01:00:00,401 --> 01:00:02,030
change the radio station when they're 
talking about boobs on opie and Anthony,

1441
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:04,650
there's fucking read.

1442
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:07,400
That's a form of retard right there.
Well,

1443
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:12,440
it's also a person who's very self 
righteous because she thinks that she 

1444
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:12,560
can get away with telling people what to
say and what not to say.

1445
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:15,030
You don't have to like comedy,
you don't have to like accommodate.

1446
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:18,380
So for everybody,
but just either shut up or leave,

1447
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:20,150
you know,
don't fucking get angry.

1448
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:23,870
Don't yell shit out of me because she 
was yelling at me to stop and stop.

1449
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:25,390
Stop.
Like what?

1450
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,010
I'm talking about your fake guy.
Sorry.

1451
01:00:28,011 --> 01:00:30,950
I'm talking about a fake retarded guy 
that I made up.

1452
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:32,570
It's killing you.
Remember,

1453
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:37,630
remember,
remember when the first videos I've 

1454
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:40,031
filmed for you was.
I was sitting behind a guy and he was 

1455
01:00:40,031 --> 01:00:40,031
getting so upset.
Oh yeah.

1456
01:00:40,031 --> 01:00:44,441
Watching your show.
I was filming his legs starting to 

1457
01:00:44,441 --> 01:00:44,690
Flinch.
He was like fucking looking around.

1458
01:00:44,691 --> 01:00:46,960
There was the Noah's Ark Shit,
was it?

1459
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:51,960
Yeah.
Then he wrote a letter a couple of days 

1460
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,690
later and we've had a bunch of letters.
Where does the phrase,

1461
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,300
when you say science,
where did that originally come from?

1462
01:00:56,630 --> 01:01:01,630
Thomas Dolby.
And Thomas told she blinded me with 

1463
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:01,630
science.
If you've ever seen the video.

1464
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:06,551
The guy was the uh,
our answer to the scientist on TV in 

1465
01:01:06,551 --> 01:01:07,250
England.
He's old.

1466
01:01:07,251 --> 01:01:08,930
If you see the video,
he would just yell science.

1467
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:13,960
That guy's a real.
He's like our bill Nye the science guy 

1468
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:14,950
video.
So that's what I wanted to talk about.

1469
01:01:14,951 --> 01:01:16,510
What we were talking about,
the whole Jesus thing,

1470
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:20,970
I almost forgot was that giant fucking 
statue in in Columbia.

1471
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:22,790
It was at Columbus,
Cincinnati,

1472
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:28,090
Cincinnati,
this fucking 70 foot Jesus got hit by 

1473
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:31,691
lightening,
caught on fire and right across the 

1474
01:01:31,691 --> 01:01:34,181
street was the street from.
It was a big billboard for the hustler 

1475
01:01:34,181 --> 01:01:34,181
store.
I love.

1476
01:01:34,181 --> 01:01:37,400
And so billboard not a scratch.

1477
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:38,480
I love the quote.
Yeah.

1478
01:01:38,481 --> 01:01:40,460
It was like,
I think it's Kinda messed up,

1479
01:01:40,461 --> 01:01:43,820
but the hustler billboard didn't catch 
on fire and that's just not right.

1480
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:45,500
One Guy said,
my favorite quote,

1481
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:47,150
one guy said,
I didn't expect that.

1482
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:51,350
Expect that.
I expect that.

1483
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:53,690
I'll thought the magic man.
We've got a bit.

1484
01:01:53,691 --> 01:01:58,691
I mean the stupidest thing about it is 
you're not supposed to make like idols 

1485
01:01:58,691 --> 01:01:59,570
of Jesus.
Isn't that like even in the Bible you're

1486
01:01:59,571 --> 01:02:02,330
not supposed to like make,
make churches even.

1487
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:07,360
Doesn't that say in the Bible that he'd 
rather have you do it under a tree than 

1488
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:07,570
break would or something like that make 
a church or something,

1489
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,290
something like that.
Something like that.

1490
01:02:09,291 --> 01:02:11,170
I don't know.
I cannot quote the Bible here.

1491
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:16,180
Can I just have no fucking at the part 
you're saying I don't know a goddamn 

1492
01:02:16,511 --> 01:02:18,200
thing in it anymore.
I read it when I was younger.

1493
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:20,100
When I lived Florida.
They made us read

1494
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:20,970
it.
They didn't make us read it,

1495
01:02:20,971 --> 01:02:23,700
but they gave it to us and they gave us 
an opportunity to read it.

1496
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:29,270
They handed out bibles in the class and 
I went from San Francisco to Florida in 

1497
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:29,460
San Francisco.
Super Liberal,

1498
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:34,610
had gay neighbors.
My aunt used to go next door and smoke 

1499
01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:35,160
weed with gay neighbors and they would 
get naked and play the bongos together.

1500
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:40,250
So I was like around all these hippies 
and war protest type people in San 

1501
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:44,510
Francisco.
So I moved from there to like Super 

1502
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:47,510
Religious Retard Florida.
So I'm like right around retards and 

1503
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:49,980
they're.
They're handed out bibles and this one 

1504
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:49,980
kid,
he gets his Bible.

1505
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:51,660
I swear to God the word fucking 11.
He gets his Bible.

1506
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:55,050
I'll never forget this.
He goes to read the Bible.

1507
01:02:56,010 --> 01:03:01,010
That's what he said to read the Bible 
and then he sits there all like crazy,

1508
01:03:01,501 --> 01:03:03,120
like excited to be reading this book.

1509
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:03,780
Like,
Whoa,

1510
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:07,050
what that fucking kid's face and what he
said.

1511
01:03:07,051 --> 01:03:09,060
Well,
it burned into my head.

1512
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,370
Definitely.
Definitely lochner.

1513
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:17,030
I went to Catholic school.
I don't remember shit from that Bible 

1514
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:20,670
for years.
I went to Catholic school and I went to 

1515
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:22,650
a Catholic school.
It's so fucked up that the people should

1516
01:03:22,651 --> 01:03:25,770
allow anyone to push any ideology on the
kids.

1517
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,900
Everybody thinks that like having your 
kids grow up.

1518
01:03:27,901 --> 01:03:30,150
Religion is no big deal and you know,
it's good for them.

1519
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:35,480
I agree to give some kids some morals 
and set some standards of behavior and 

1520
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:40,251
to tell them that you know,
about communicating with people that 

1521
01:03:40,251 --> 01:03:40,251
what's important is you be positive.
You can do good things,

1522
01:03:40,251 --> 01:03:41,220
be a good person,
you know,

1523
01:03:41,221 --> 01:03:46,221
and,
and spread out that good energy spread 

1524
01:03:46,221 --> 01:03:47,070
out love.
But to make the kid to go to any fucking

1525
01:03:47,071 --> 01:03:52,071
super religious school,
you're going to fuck their programming 

1526
01:03:52,071 --> 01:03:52,071
up so bad,
you know,

1527
01:03:52,071 --> 01:03:56,481
but no one is objective enough to see 
that people just want to have good kids 

1528
01:03:56,481 --> 01:03:57,510
and they want to carry on the tradition 
that their family has.

1529
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:02,720
Religion as a child should start off as 
in a different religion and then move 

1530
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,680
onto Christianity or whatever.
Like I should start off as Buddhist,

1531
01:04:04,681 --> 01:04:09,681
like just teaching to be a good person 
and then you get into like that that 

1532
01:04:09,681 --> 01:04:13,610
they should do is teach you the 
different principles of each religion 

1533
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:14,280
and not say either one of them is the 
fucking answer,

1534
01:04:14,281 --> 01:04:16,050
right?
There's too many of them.

1535
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:19,410
You look at all the good aspects of all 
the different religions and say,

1536
01:04:19,411 --> 01:04:20,610
well,
where did all this come from?

1537
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:23,730
We don't know.
We don't know where it came from.

1538
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:28,760
We assume it came from some wise people 
that got through a lot of conflict and 

1539
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:32,991
figured out some way to live life and 
then they wrote it down and some of it 

1540
01:04:32,991 --> 01:04:33,480
makes a lot of sense even today.
But when,

1541
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:36,870
when the book that you're basing 
everything on includes treating women as

1542
01:04:36,871 --> 01:04:39,480
second class citizens,
condoning slavery,

1543
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:44,600
murder a fucking angry God who punishes 
people by death and you're gonna burn 

1544
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:46,410
into fucking fiery hell,
come on,

1545
01:04:46,411 --> 01:04:48,330
just shut the fuck up.
Just stop it.

1546
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:51,080
You're talking goofy nonsense.
You know you,

1547
01:04:51,081 --> 01:04:54,360
you got to show me something.
You've got to show me up fucking youtube

1548
01:04:54,361 --> 01:04:59,361
clip.
You got to show me something before I 

1549
01:04:59,361 --> 01:04:59,370
went and believe in,
in this kind of goofy shit is silly.

1550
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:04,530
But in 2010,
we still let that slide.

1551
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:05,640
We still say,
well,

1552
01:05:05,641 --> 01:05:10,641
you know,
everyone has their own freedom of 

1553
01:05:10,641 --> 01:05:10,641
religion.
Do whatever you want.

1554
01:05:10,641 --> 01:05:11,580
But if you start saying like,
stop,

1555
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:16,600
this is fucking completely ridiculous.
You're saying your way is the only way 

1556
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,040
you're saying people should die if they.
You're saying

1557
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,080
you know people can't be gay and get 
married.

1558
01:05:20,081 --> 01:05:25,081
You're saying you're,
you're imposing all your bullshit on 

1559
01:05:25,081 --> 01:05:27,310
other people.
And we still accept it in 2010 except at

1560
01:05:27,311 --> 01:05:29,800
the Church of what's happening now.
That's where I'm from,

1561
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:32,140
church.
That matters in my book.

1562
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:35,410
What are we going to get past this?
When are we going to get past?

1563
01:05:35,411 --> 01:05:37,750
When were you going to step up and say,
no one knows.

1564
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,040
No one knows.
You don't know.

1565
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:40,540
Don't say,
you know you can't say,

1566
01:05:40,541 --> 01:05:41,160
you know,
if you say,

1567
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:43,870
you know you're crazy,
tell me your experiences.

1568
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,880
Tell me what happened.
Throw it in the pile.

1569
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:50,910
Let's all sort this out.
You can't tell me that you know this is 

1570
01:05:50,910 --> 01:05:51,910
the way and you're the chosen people and
she just shut the fuck up.

1571
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:55,880
Stop your all your Joseph Smith and 
you're fucking nutty.

1572
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:57,520
Scientology.
Stop.

1573
01:05:57,610 --> 01:05:59,140
Stop.
It's all crazy.

1574
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:04,230
You're awkward and it's fucking up 
everything because when people pretend 

1575
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:04,230
they have the answer,
it fucks up.

1576
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:08,491
Everybody else had searched for the 
answer because there's an option to not 

1577
01:06:08,491 --> 01:06:08,491
even think.
There's an option to like,

1578
01:06:08,491 --> 01:06:12,100
fuck joining the search to figure out 
how to live the life the best way.

1579
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:14,470
Let's just fucking follow.
These douche bags are doing.

1580
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:20,520
Did you ever.
Were you ever religious when you were a 

1581
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:20,520
kid?

1582
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:20,740
I made my first communion.
I got thrown out of there.

1583
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:22,870
I got thrown out of there before my 
confirmation.

1584
01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:28,170
What happened?
I beat up the fucking none storytelling 

1585
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:29,210
stage.
That's the true story.

1586
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,240
Tell me what happened.
Tell me what happened.

1587
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:33,040
I was in the fourth grade,
fifth grade,

1588
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:38,050
and my friends,
I hung out with these two little twins 

1589
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:41,400
and the one kid's mother was having a 
baby and he wanted to call and then 

1590
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:41,680
we'll let them fucking call.
So he's crying.

1591
01:06:41,681 --> 01:06:43,330
You know how twins are.
One starts crying,

1592
01:06:43,331 --> 01:06:45,370
the other one started fucking crying.
They're crying.

1593
01:06:45,371 --> 01:06:47,860
I'm trying to learn my fucking abcs.
And I said,

1594
01:06:47,861 --> 01:06:49,810
just let him call.
And she's like,

1595
01:06:49,811 --> 01:06:51,270
mind your business,
little quality.

1596
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:56,320
Pay Your Bill.
How can you not let somebody call the 

1597
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:56,320
hospital?
This isn't like a corridor.

1598
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,840
Joe Rogan,
I this your mother and the none wouldn't

1599
01:06:58,841 --> 01:06:59,080
let him.

1600
01:06:59,080 --> 01:06:59,980
So I said,
you know,

1601
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:05,130
fucking get up and go.
So she'd made me in the two other guys 

1602
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:08,011
get up and wait outside.
Then she took me into the stationery 

1603
01:07:08,011 --> 01:07:10,480
closet and she beat him up first and I 
could hear it outside.

1604
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:13,280
I'm in the fourth grade now.
My mom used to always say,

1605
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:15,180
don't let people hit you if they hit 
you,

1606
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:20,460
whatever.
So she takes me to the closet and she 

1607
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:20,590
turned her ring around and she just 
started hitting me,

1608
01:07:20,591 --> 01:07:22,030
hitting fucking hit me,
hit me,

1609
01:07:22,031 --> 01:07:24,460
hit me,
hit me in the face and shit,

1610
01:07:24,461 --> 01:07:29,461
and I like a taste of blood in my lip 
and that's when I couldn't take it no 

1611
01:07:29,461 --> 01:07:33,811
more.
I just fucking grabbed her and took her 

1612
01:07:33,811 --> 01:07:34,240
around and I didn't know nothing.
I just hold it by the fucking throat and

1613
01:07:34,241 --> 01:07:35,410
I said,
I'm calling my mother.

1614
01:07:35,411 --> 01:07:38,450
This is going to fucking stop it real 
quick.

1615
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:39,550
No,
but here's what's crazy.

1616
01:07:39,551 --> 01:07:42,850
It was a disciplinary in there that 
walked around with a stick and he hit me

1617
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:45,940
in the leg and his name was Jack.
He had gone to the school.

1618
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:50,980
He had stayed there as a teacher's 
assistant and he's the one that lit you 

1619
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:53,821
on fire.
Every once in awhile he would light you 

1620
01:07:53,821 --> 01:07:53,821
on fire.
You know what I'm saying?

1621
01:07:53,821 --> 01:07:57,060
What do you mean he will hit you?
You know he was punching or smell hunch 

1622
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:57,060
you.
Oh yeah.

1623
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:58,840
And I fucking would punch you oprah on 
the chest and shit,

1624
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:03,841
and I had that in mind.
But if you went home and told your 

1625
01:08:03,841 --> 01:08:03,841
mother you were kind of scared.
I just couldn't,

1626
01:08:03,841 --> 01:08:05,020
couldn't take people hitting me.
I never liked that.

1627
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,000
So I grabbed her.
He threatened to call.

1628
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:12,060
He didn't,
didn't even threaten to call the cops 

1629
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:12,060
because I had blood coming out of my 
mouth.

1630
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:12,550
So I said I'm getting to the payphone 
and called my mother.

1631
01:08:12,551 --> 01:08:14,820
She's going to come here and we're going
to straighten this up.

1632
01:08:14,821 --> 01:08:16,010
But the funny thing is my mother came

1633
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:19,310
with like 20 dudes from the bar so that 
we made a deal.

1634
01:08:19,311 --> 01:08:21,410
They couldn't expel me because I didn't 
do nothing.

1635
01:08:21,411 --> 01:08:26,411
I just protected myself.
It was my fucking lip hanging like 

1636
01:08:26,411 --> 01:08:26,411
chocolate.
Does your mother,

1637
01:08:26,411 --> 01:08:26,600
you're mad at him?
Yeah,

1638
01:08:26,601 --> 01:08:28,790
my mother went off and then that's when 
we made an agreement.

1639
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:31,160
I'm going to stay till June.
This happened in April.

1640
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:34,090
So for two months at a time,
Jack got close to him.

1641
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:36,530
Remember when my mother said,
I'll fucking kill you motherfucker.

1642
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:39,110
So for the last two months of my fourth 
grade,

1643
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:44,440
they couldn't even say nothing to him 
and I started revolting having other 

1644
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:47,540
kids telling their parents.
Now it's just such a joyless religion.

1645
01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:52,400
How can you go back and see her pulling 
my ear or give me a punch to the back or

1646
01:08:52,401 --> 01:08:54,290
something.
I don't want to Catholic schools.

1647
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:55,970
I went to Catholic school from first 
grade.

1648
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:58,160
I was very religious when I was a little
kid.

1649
01:08:58,190 --> 01:09:00,710
When I was a little kid,
my parents got divorced when I was five.

1650
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:03,590
They separated and I was really lost and
I was really scared.

1651
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:05,630
I remember thinking like,
my dad's not around anymore.

1652
01:09:05,631 --> 01:09:07,790
This is crazy.
It's just me and my mom and my sister.

1653
01:09:07,791 --> 01:09:09,260
It's like,
it was very unsettling.

1654
01:09:09,261 --> 01:09:14,261
My mom had to work all day and we had to
be in different people's houses while 

1655
01:09:14,261 --> 01:09:14,261
they babysat us or grandparents,
whatever.

1656
01:09:14,261 --> 01:09:17,000
It was unsettling.
And while this was all going on,

1657
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:20,360
I went to Catholic school and it was my 
first year in Catholic school,

1658
01:09:20,361 --> 01:09:23,510
first grade,
and they were so fucking mean.

1659
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:26,330
Dude.
I don't remember shit about first grade.

1660
01:09:26,331 --> 01:09:31,331
Okay.
I don't remember anything about being 

1661
01:09:31,331 --> 01:09:31,331
six years old.
You know what?

1662
01:09:31,331 --> 01:09:33,911
I remember sister Mary Josephine at Our 
Lady of Chester Hova in Paterson,

1663
01:09:34,041 --> 01:09:34,550
New Jersey.

1664
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:36,290
I think it was patterson,
Patterson or NORC.

1665
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:39,190
I remember that.
I remember that experience.

1666
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:42,380
I lived there for a year.
Okay.

1667
01:09:42,381 --> 01:09:47,381
I went to that school for a year and in 
that year I went to school everyday 

1668
01:09:47,381 --> 01:09:48,260
terrified and everyday that was just 
fucking cunt.

1669
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:49,610
Old.
Wasted up,

1670
01:09:49,730 --> 01:09:51,110
used up life.
None.

1671
01:09:51,111 --> 01:09:55,490
That was just evil to everyone.
Every day it was always yelling at you.

1672
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:58,590
I would cry like I missed my mother.
Like the first day I cry.

1673
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:03,740
You might cry like a baby.
Crazy man.

1674
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:10,300
This fucking evil cunt.
And if you didn't do your work right or 

1675
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:11,060
you didn't listen to her or anything was
wrong,

1676
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:16,180
she'll tell you.
She's going to make you sit on a nail 

1677
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:16,180
and the closet.
It was like a fucking pink floyd video.

1678
01:10:16,190 --> 01:10:18,560
Is that just east coast religion or 
something like that?

1679
01:10:18,561 --> 01:10:20,880
Because you guys just go after these 
scary.

1680
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:26,210
Don't let them fuck when people don't 
get the fuck they're not happy.

1681
01:10:26,211 --> 01:10:27,590
Period.
End of discussion.

1682
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:30,530
Your whole life is no deck.
How are you going to be happy?

1683
01:10:30,531 --> 01:10:32,180
You're not going to come.
You don't come at all.

1684
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:37,330
What does the Guy Do?
He doesn't come because he his a fuck 

1685
01:10:37,330 --> 01:10:37,330
the Fox.
Nolan.

1686
01:10:37,330 --> 01:10:38,150
He can't even jerk off.
What kind of a life is that?

1687
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:40,970
That's a horrible existence.
It's not love.

1688
01:10:40,971 --> 01:10:42,410
It's not passion.
Emotion,

1689
01:10:42,411 --> 01:10:46,190
celebration of life.
Now it's all just do what I tell you.

1690
01:10:46,191 --> 01:10:49,490
Follow my rules or you burn in Hell and 
let me touch a cock.

1691
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:51,560
There's a lot of that.
I was going to go back and talk to them,

1692
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:56,920
but the school's governing,
it's in New Jersey and I was there one 

1693
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:57,290
time and I was like over there and just 
talk to them,

1694
01:10:57,291 --> 01:10:59,060
but they will.
That school was closed up.

1695
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:04,060
It was when I got older and I started 
hearing stories about kids getting 

1696
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:04,060
molested.
I get fucking angry.

1697
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:05,810
I got angry at my mom.
I said,

1698
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:08,660
how are you letting me go to school in a
place where it people getting molested,

1699
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:11,210
you know,
like the preset were molesting kids,

1700
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:13,230
but I don't.
No,

1701
01:11:13,231 --> 01:11:16,620
nobody was always close.
It got covered up fast,

1702
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:18,850
but there was almost like this thing 
that they deserve it though.

1703
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:20,230
What the fuck are you doing being an 
altar boy?

1704
01:11:20,231 --> 01:11:21,120
So it was like,
don't you know,

1705
01:11:21,150 --> 01:11:23,140
there was like this weird little like,
C'mon wasn't why was,

1706
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:24,690
why is he being an altar boy?
You know,

1707
01:11:24,691 --> 01:11:26,020
it's like maybe when they were altar 
boys,

1708
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:31,050
like he was like almost an excuse that 
maybe he knew and he wanted it like 

1709
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:31,350
fucking crazy.
So weird.

1710
01:11:31,351 --> 01:11:34,670
Because like my band,
my religion was completely different.

1711
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:37,380
It was like there was a starbucks there,
there was like a band,

1712
01:11:37,381 --> 01:11:39,030
you know,
with that kind of like a party.

1713
01:11:40,810 --> 01:11:42,780
It's totally different.
Yeah.

1714
01:11:42,781 --> 01:11:45,960
But there's a lot of good products that 
are like emily luther,

1715
01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:47,910
they become a good part of the 
community.

1716
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:52,920
It's like a nice step off point where 
everybody gets together and promises to 

1717
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:52,920
be nice.
You know,

1718
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:57,800
you promise to abide by the laws and 
respect your friends and you have 

1719
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:58,570
cookouts and shit and there's a lot of 
positivity in,

1720
01:11:58,571 --> 01:11:59,370
in,
in being,

1721
01:11:59,371 --> 01:12:01,440
in a church.
There's a lot of positive shit about any

1722
01:12:01,441 --> 01:12:06,441
big community gathering where everybody 
agrees to be nice and the best way to 

1723
01:12:06,441 --> 01:12:07,200
get everybody to agree to be nice to say
that's what God wants.

1724
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:10,500
There's a lot of fucking great things 
about church but not the Catholic church

1725
01:12:10,501 --> 01:12:12,360
pro that is shut.
That shit ain't good.

1726
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:14,190
This fucking thing that's going on with 
the,

1727
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:15,420
the,
the uh,

1728
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:20,720
the,
the pope we've talked about or are they 

1729
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:20,720
on a show?
But for people that don't know,

1730
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:23,990
the guy who's the pope right now is been
accused and there's all this evidence 

1731
01:12:24,781 --> 01:12:27,570
that points to the fact that he was 
shielding child molesters.

1732
01:12:27,571 --> 01:12:29,340
The Guy,
this guy who's the pope,

1733
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:32,850
he was protecting the church and 
shielding known child molesters and then

1734
01:12:32,851 --> 01:12:37,851
putting them back in action around other
kids that the guy went on to molest 

1735
01:12:37,851 --> 01:12:42,531
again.
And the fact that there's people that 

1736
01:12:42,531 --> 01:12:42,540
are calling for that guy to be arrested 
for crimes against humanity.

1737
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:47,750
You know,
like Christopher hitchins is called for 

1738
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:47,750
the,
for people to,

1739
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:50,660
to arrest him and charge him with,
with pedophilia or charge him with child

1740
01:12:50,661 --> 01:12:55,661
labor and child endangerment or whatever
the fuck he did though was involved 

1741
01:12:55,661 --> 01:12:59,900
knowingly and exposed pedophiles to 
children with some of them moved to try 

1742
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:02,760
to protect the business of the Catholic 
church to a different place.

1743
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,410
Behavior.
So yeah,

1744
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:05,800
exactly that.
Nobody.

1745
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:07,380
No,
you didn't let the church know.

1746
01:13:07,381 --> 01:13:12,381
You didn't let nobody know that this 
fucking guy likes to dress up as Peter 

1747
01:13:12,381 --> 01:13:13,420
Pan.
I mean,

1748
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,280
Hey,
I don't mind.

1749
01:13:14,730 --> 01:13:19,730
Let's handle the fucking problem,
but don't put them in the witness 

1750
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:21,360
relocation plan for priests and ship 
them up to Albany and two years from now

1751
01:13:21,570 --> 01:13:26,570
you got another molestation.
Ship them across the world to 

1752
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:26,570
Philippines.
Then they're at all.

1753
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:27,540
When they fall,
they do something there.

1754
01:13:27,541 --> 01:13:30,660
They shipped them to Germany.
They just keep moving them around.

1755
01:13:30,661 --> 01:13:32,250
Avid capital.
It's been proven.

1756
01:13:32,251 --> 01:13:33,600
Now if you,
what does that,

1757
01:13:33,601 --> 01:13:36,060
um,
what is the fucking documentary?

1758
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:39,930
The documentary a one horrible one.
The priests.

1759
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:44,990
Hold on,
I'll find it in two seconds because I 

1760
01:13:44,990 --> 01:13:44,990
got it on my itunes.
Did you watch it?

1761
01:13:44,990 --> 01:13:47,940
Yeah,
I watched half of it and I couldn't 

1762
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:47,940
watch it anymore because it was just 
driving me crazy.

1763
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:52,310
It was just so horrible.
Deliver us from evil and this is all 

1764
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:52,350
about a guy who was just his whole life 
boys.

1765
01:13:52,351 --> 01:13:57,351
Girls just molested,
molested hundreds of them and they just 

1766
01:13:57,351 --> 01:14:00,651
moved this motherfucker around.
They just moved them around and 

1767
01:14:00,651 --> 01:14:00,651
protected.
I'm protected the church.

1768
01:14:00,651 --> 01:14:01,110
There's so many of them that are doing 
it,

1769
01:14:01,111 --> 01:14:02,490
man.
It's not like one or two.

1770
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,260
There's so many of them.
It's a percentage.

1771
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,620
It's not like a small number,
you know?

1772
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:09,090
It's fucking terrifying and a lot of it 
is just accepted.

1773
01:14:09,091 --> 01:14:10,740
A lot of people just keep the fucking 
mouth shut.

1774
01:14:10,930 --> 01:14:12,760
Just avoid the creepy flux,
you know?

1775
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:13,930
And then I guess like,
you know,

1776
01:14:13,931 --> 01:14:16,780
maybe some of the kids that get sucked 
into like gay kids get sucked in and who

1777
01:14:16,781 --> 01:14:17,470
knows,
you know,

1778
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:20,830
but it's the idea behind it is 
ridiculous that these,

1779
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:25,950
these crazy assholes that don't fuck 
have a front row seat to God like they 

1780
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:25,950
have.

1781
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:29,260
They have the best connection they got.
They got God's best cell phone number.

1782
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:32,230
Like it's fucking crazy that they don't 
even get a special spot in heaven,

1783
01:14:32,570 --> 01:14:34,360
you know,
and we all grew up with it.

1784
01:14:34,361 --> 01:14:35,140
I mean,
Joey can tell you,

1785
01:14:35,141 --> 01:14:40,141
anybody who went to Catholic school,
nobody went to Catholic school and had 

1786
01:14:40,141 --> 01:14:40,500
an awesome experience.
I think we got a little less.

1787
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:43,150
That's the thing I just beat the fuck 
out of.

1788
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:43,750
Yeah.
No,

1789
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:48,870
nobody even beat me.
I think she whacked me with a ruler 

1790
01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:48,870
wants,
but it wasn't bad.

1791
01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:48,870
It was just a little slap,
you know?

1792
01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:50,890
It wasn't anything like nobody ever did 
what they did to you.

1793
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:51,940
Well,
don't get me wrong.

1794
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,230
I always fucking fueled crazy lit.
That's why they put me there.

1795
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:58,240
I'm sure.
I'm sure you will.

1796
01:14:58,290 --> 01:15:00,170
It wasn't for the beat and that they 
would give him.

1797
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:00,990
Listen for that.

1798
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:03,420
He never,
never allowed to beat a kid Po.

1799
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:05,140
That was terrible.
You never lead with you that.

1800
01:15:05,150 --> 01:15:10,150
That's a crazy angry human being.
She wasn't a lack of love fucking bitch.

1801
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:14,990
Dot Eisen was a vape sister Mary ice at 
the.

1802
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:20,010
Something like that.
If you had a choice between hanging out 

1803
01:15:20,010 --> 01:15:21,370
with an old nun or hanging out with an 
old porn star,

1804
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:23,480
who are you gonna hang out with,
you know,

1805
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:24,640
pretty simple,
you know,

1806
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:26,530
hanging out with Nina Hartley.
I bet she's a nice lady.

1807
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:28,760
You know?
I bet she has a good conversation.

1808
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:30,760
I bet she's cool and friendly and I 
better eyebrows.

1809
01:15:30,761 --> 01:15:35,761
Look really creepy.
Eye lashes but crazy fake eyelashes.

1810
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:38,110
That's old school.
That's the old school.

1811
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:40,750
Look,
that's a hot look back in the day,

1812
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:41,750
but you know what I'm saying?
I mean it's,

1813
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:44,590
it's just an unfortunate choice to waste
your whole life,

1814
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:46,600
you know,
in a non loving,

1815
01:15:46,601 --> 01:15:51,601
non friendship oriented sort of a 
situation like that based on a bunch of 

1816
01:15:51,601 --> 01:15:55,831
fucking silly,
crazy old rules we need as a human 

1817
01:15:55,831 --> 01:15:55,831
being,
as a human,

1818
01:15:55,831 --> 01:15:57,820
the human beings as a race,
we have to,

1819
01:15:57,821 --> 01:16:02,821
as a race,
get past where we're at right now and 

1820
01:16:02,821 --> 01:16:05,221
move into some new way of designing the 
way human beings behave and act and it 

1821
01:16:05,221 --> 01:16:06,370
can't be based on some nonsense.

1822
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:09,550
It has to be based on just positive 
energy and success.

1823
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:12,220
Success as a race success,
as a neighborhood success,

1824
01:16:12,221 --> 01:16:17,221
as a group of friends,
you know there's a way to live your 

1825
01:16:17,221 --> 01:16:17,221
life,
there's a way to be positive and there's

1826
01:16:17,221 --> 01:16:20,971
way to figure out a way to spread the 
most positive energy and the way they'd 

1827
01:16:20,971 --> 01:16:24,391
be the most honest,
the way they'd be the most creative and 

1828
01:16:24,391 --> 01:16:25,210
the most friendly and the most 
productive and the most satisfied.

1829
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:27,740
There's a way to do that and it's not 
through religions currently.

1830
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:29,040
Re tweeting,
you know,

1831
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:33,290
he's a little positive bump,
right?

1832
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:34,450
Like I just said,
man,

1833
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:40,170
retweets and pokes.
Retweets are actually cool when someone 

1834
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:40,200
cool retweets you.
Wow.

1835
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:45,360
I always forget to look though at the re
tweets because I use just the twitter 

1836
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:45,360
website.
I don't use it too much,

1837
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:50,161
you know,
so I owe you have to go to like 

1838
01:16:50,161 --> 01:16:50,161
retweets,
go to the twitter website,

1839
01:16:50,161 --> 01:16:54,740
do I give up on tweet deck and all that 
stuff just keeps timing out and I'll 

1840
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:58,710
type it out.
But I love having all the different 

1841
01:16:58,710 --> 01:16:58,710
lines.
I love having,

1842
01:16:58,710 --> 01:17:00,100
you know,
my timeline and I tried to respond to as

1843
01:17:00,101 --> 01:17:01,990
many as possible.
Some people get crazy.

1844
01:17:01,991 --> 01:17:03,670
Dude,
some people you don't respond to them to

1845
01:17:03,671 --> 01:17:04,600
get upset and you're like,
dude,

1846
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:08,350
I can't like 100 of these in an hour.
There's no way I can keep them up.

1847
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:10,370
When you get to like 130

1848
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:15,370
something thousand people and you say 
something funny or say something 

1849
01:17:15,370 --> 01:17:15,830
interesting,
you'd throw up some new.

1850
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:21,110
I'll get like a hundred to 53 crazy.
If it's crazy one,

1851
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,960
it might be a couple hundred.
You can't respond to them all.

1852
01:17:23,961 --> 01:17:25,160
It's impossible,
you know,

1853
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:27,860
but the beautiful thing about twitter is
even if you respond to them,

1854
01:17:27,861 --> 01:17:32,861
it's like a real quick thing and nobody 
can send you these goddamn story of 

1855
01:17:32,861 --> 01:17:32,861
their lives.
You know?

1856
01:17:32,861 --> 01:17:35,150
Some guy sent me some fucking material 
he wanted me to assess the other day.

1857
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:40,560
Some guy says I'm thinking about doing 
standup comedy and those sort of really 

1858
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,841
weirdly written letter like utility guys
psycho and he wants me to review his 

1859
01:17:44,031 --> 01:17:46,310
comedy and then he just writes out his 
whole fucking routine.

1860
01:17:46,311 --> 01:17:46,850
I'm like,
dude,

1861
01:17:46,851 --> 01:17:47,870
come on man.
I'm not gonna.

1862
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:52,990
I don't have the time.
I can't just sit here and review your 

1863
01:17:52,990 --> 01:17:52,990
comedy and tell you what I thought about
this paragraph.

1864
01:17:52,990 --> 01:17:54,650
It's like fucking up to page little 
email.

1865
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:57,540
Do you just write back,
send back that email in a tweet?

1866
01:17:59,170 --> 01:18:01,950
That's what I've been doing lately.
All these people are sending like Brian,

1867
01:18:01,951 --> 01:18:02,920
check out this documentary,
this,

1868
01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:04,180
ignore this scientism,
blah,

1869
01:18:04,190 --> 01:18:04,790
blah blah.
And I'm like,

1870
01:18:04,950 --> 01:18:09,950
dude,
write it back in 130 characters or less 

1871
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:09,950
and I'll

1872
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:09,950
reply.
Yeah,

1873
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:11,130
people need to learn how to edit in real
life too.

1874
01:18:11,131 --> 01:18:12,880
I think twitter is awesome for that.
Yeah,

1875
01:18:12,910 --> 01:18:15,360
twitter's great for jokes.
It teaches you to,

1876
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:16,870
to reply in,
um,

1877
01:18:17,190 --> 01:18:22,190
in like a short amount like,
t to get your point across in the 

1878
01:18:22,190 --> 01:18:22,190
shortest amount of words possible.

1879
01:18:22,190 --> 01:18:24,620
Could you imagine being able to tell 
women that that's how you're supposed to

1880
01:18:24,621 --> 01:18:25,700
talk to me?
And for now on,

1881
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:28,340
it has to be tweaked.
One hundred 30 words or less lady.

1882
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:33,570
You know,
Mrs Rogan just hit me with a story the 

1883
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:34,210
other day.
Oh,

1884
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:39,320
it was about chicken salad as opposed to
a chicken salad and this fucking story 

1885
01:18:39,330 --> 01:18:43,890
took it.
And meanwhile I'm on the way that gym,

1886
01:18:43,891 --> 01:18:46,950
so I'm getting fired up and ready to 
fucking hit the bag and shit.

1887
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:47,820
Fuck shit up.
Right?

1888
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:52,880
So I'm all,
I'm all amped and she corners me with 

1889
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:55,491
this chicken salad,
chicken story about how well I always 

1890
01:18:55,491 --> 01:18:59,781
get the chicken salad at this place.
But today I decided to try the chicken 

1891
01:18:59,781 --> 01:19:03,000
salad sandwich.
So I ordered the chicken salad sandwich.

1892
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,550
But since I always get the chicken 
salad,

1893
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:09,780
they gave me chicken salad.
So I got home and I was like,

1894
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,130
oh,
it's chicken salad.

1895
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:16,200
Dammit.
I wanted to try the chicken salad 

1896
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:16,200
sandwich.
And then it keeps going on.

1897
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:16,680
Like I got it.
I got to see what happened.

1898
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:18,940
Who's on first base over that?
Man,

1899
01:19:19,850 --> 01:19:24,690
there's a window opens.
She's still a callback.

1900
01:19:24,990 --> 01:19:26,070
Shiny,
happy Jihad.

1901
01:19:28,270 --> 01:19:31,690
No fucking neighborhood.
Chicks love to just talk.

1902
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:36,750
They love like reassuring communication.
Some of them do his rash generalization 

1903
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:41,011
of course,
but some of them just like to just keep 

1904
01:19:41,011 --> 01:19:41,011
fucking talking man.
They just like keep talking.

1905
01:19:41,011 --> 01:19:41,110
Yeah.

1906
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:43,280
I got an ice machine the other day.
By the way,

1907
01:19:43,281 --> 01:19:45,230
Joey,
this is a new snack for you.

1908
01:19:45,410 --> 01:19:48,800
I don't know if you like snow or ice.
Told me about the Margarita.

1909
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:50,180
Everything.
Yeah.

1910
01:19:50,181 --> 01:19:52,450
You just sit there and make up on at 
1:30

1911
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:54,110
I dropped.
No,

1912
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:56,480
but it's great because you have the Big 
Cup of ice.

1913
01:19:56,510 --> 01:19:57,830
So that's like zero calories,
right?

1914
01:19:57,980 --> 01:20:01,220
You get sugar free syrups like root beer
or grape or something like that.

1915
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:03,890
And it's just like the.
There's like ice pops,

1916
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:08,920
remember this frozen pops like the 
bottom and it gets all mushy and you 

1917
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:08,920
know,
eyes.

1918
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:08,920
It's just like a whole

1919
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:09,750
cup of that.
But there's no calories in it.

1920
01:20:11,530 --> 01:20:13,650
I restrict myself to one diet coke a 
week.

1921
01:20:13,651 --> 01:20:14,840
No Diet coke.
Yeah.

1922
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:17,460
As I'm getting older I'm like,
you've got to pay.

1923
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:19,290
Okay.
Nothing is for free.

1924
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:24,540
Right?
And when you're eating this stuff that 

1925
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:24,780
tastes sweet and it's not really sweet 
and it doesn't have any calories,

1926
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:28,470
what the fuck is really going on?
What's going on,

1927
01:20:28,471 --> 01:20:33,471
man?
I mean you could tell me the diet coke 

1928
01:20:33,471 --> 01:20:33,471
is safe and I'm sure it is.
I mean I've drinken a bunch of them.

1929
01:20:33,471 --> 01:20:34,410
Nothing's wrong with me.
You know,

1930
01:20:34,411 --> 01:20:36,450
I used to do a joke.
If you get cancer from diet coke,

1931
01:20:36,451 --> 01:20:37,290
you're a fucking pussy.

1932
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:44,360
Reality is.
The reality is that kit check can be 

1933
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:44,360
good for you.
Yeah,

1934
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:47,270
but I mean it's like what?
Do you want diabetes or do you want 

1935
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:47,370
maybe a ankle cancer?
I'll have a water.

1936
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:49,980
You.
They have to have a coke.

1937
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:52,380
If you didn't have water,
okay.

1938
01:20:52,381 --> 01:20:55,380
If you were just forced to drink coca 
cola every day and then someone gave you

1939
01:20:55,381 --> 01:20:57,150
a nice ice cold water and be like,
God,

1940
01:20:57,151 --> 01:20:59,910
this tastes so good.
If water was like super precious,

1941
01:21:00,110 --> 01:21:01,380
I know like there wasn't that much of 
it.

1942
01:21:01,381 --> 01:21:04,400
So you'd go to like a fucking restaurant
and buy some water and you know,

1943
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:07,560
for real good water it would cost you 
$100 a bottle,

1944
01:21:07,561 --> 01:21:09,630
like a bottle of wine and you drink it 
and be like,

1945
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:10,890
oh,
this is delicious.

1946
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,630
It's so satisfying.
I don't want it to end anyway.

1947
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:14,460
You just take it for granted.

1948
01:21:14,490 --> 01:21:16,410
You open up a bottle but a little,
a little drink it.

1949
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:19,620
No big deal.
Water Tastes fucking awesome.

1950
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:24,800
All right.
We just don't think it tastes awesome 

1951
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,661
because we want that goofy sugar rush 
and then that Goofy Coca Cola sugars 

1952
01:21:26,661 --> 01:21:28,080
that we're all addicted to.
Caffeine rush.

1953
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:33,620
I went to Baja fresh the other day.
I had a chicken burrito and it's big 

1954
01:21:33,620 --> 01:21:34,770
mother fucking dichos dude.
It was giant.

1955
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:38,120
I direct that thick and I was wired.
That was wired.

1956
01:21:38,210 --> 01:21:40,160
It was like.
It was like I had a 20 ounce starbucks.

1957
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:45,180
Another big ass coat.
The worst is have you ever had like you 

1958
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:47,440
were really thirsty at night and you 
only have like a diet coke on your 

1959
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:48,720
nightstand in Chug it and that's the 
worst warm.

1960
01:21:48,790 --> 01:21:50,430
Oh yes.
Sitting there all night.

1961
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:53,210
Caffeine.
Yeah.

1962
01:21:53,670 --> 01:21:55,170
I.
You know what's good man?

1963
01:21:55,171 --> 01:21:57,480
I got these new drinks that these dudes 
sent me.

1964
01:21:57,770 --> 01:21:59,520
If you're into energy,
not an energy drink,

1965
01:21:59,521 --> 01:22:01,170
but workout drinks,
just healthy,

1966
01:22:01,171 --> 01:22:03,030
good for your drinks.
A lot of Ginseng and shit in them.

1967
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:04,800
They're called good for you.
Drinks.

1968
01:22:04,801 --> 01:22:06,390
These guys sent me a whole case of these
things.

1969
01:22:06,391 --> 01:22:09,300
They're fucking awesome.
They're like the best workout.

1970
01:22:09,301 --> 01:22:11,100
Drink less.
You have gatorade.

1971
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:13,830
Gatorade is good after you work out,
but it's like a little too sugary.

1972
01:22:18,650 --> 01:22:20,300
I always add water.
Two months.

1973
01:22:20,330 --> 01:22:22,520
Yeah,
you have to pour water in and I did that

1974
01:22:22,521 --> 01:22:26,020
with all juices to apple juice,
orange juice to citric for me.

1975
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:30,440
Let's mix it with some water.
Anyway,

1976
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:32,250
these people that if you.
It's good for you.

1977
01:22:32,251 --> 01:22:33,500
Drinks good.
The letter,

1978
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:36,480
the number for you drinks.
You could find them on twitter.

1979
01:22:36,481 --> 01:22:38,380
You can find them online.
I'll go google them.

1980
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:40,620
It's shit.
If you're into a good workout,

1981
01:22:40,621 --> 01:22:45,621
drink and they support mma.
I found out about them through Shane 

1982
01:22:45,621 --> 01:22:46,140
Corwin and I know they've sent Jason 
Ellis some some shit.

1983
01:22:46,141 --> 01:22:48,540
They're good guys.
They'd go get it now for a word from our

1984
01:22:48,541 --> 01:22:52,160
sponsor.
Flashlight back at the beginning.

1985
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,650
These gentlemen,
fleshlight dot Tom.

1986
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,030
Masturbate.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1987
01:22:57,031 --> 01:22:58,590
and I know you do.
Let's be real.

1988
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:01,290
Wouldn't you want to fuck something that
feels better than your hand?

1989
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:06,560
I know I do because I know when I'm 
masturbating at least half of my body 

1990
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:06,560
saying,

1991
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:11,010
hey dude,
you've got a dick in your hand and it 

1992
01:23:11,010 --> 01:23:12,991
doesn't feel as good when you.
When you're thinking about that and you 

1993
01:23:12,991 --> 01:23:12,991
think about the fact you got a dick in 
your hand,

1994
01:23:12,991 --> 01:23:13,970
it doesn't feel as good.
So what I proposed last gentleman,

1995
01:23:13,971 --> 01:23:16,570
as you go to fleshlight.com,
you get one of these things and you fuck

1996
01:23:16,571 --> 01:23:17,110
it.
All right.

1997
01:23:17,111 --> 01:23:20,110
You got to get past the embarrassment 
and I tell you from personal experience,

1998
01:23:20,111 --> 01:23:24,010
because I knew about the shit,
I'd heard about it on TV and on TV ads.

1999
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:29,040
I heard about it on the Internet.
I heard about people talking about a 

2000
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:29,040
little Eddie Bravo.
Told me his flashlight story before.

2001
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:32,020
He's had a flashlight for awhile,
but I was too proud to walk into a store

2002
01:23:32,021 --> 01:23:37,021
or order one online.
I will approve too proud to even admit 

2003
01:23:37,021 --> 01:23:37,021
that I masturbate.
That shit's ridiculous.

2004
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:41,600
So my dad told me about this fucking 
thing that he's hooked onto right now.

2005
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:44,960
Cut a reserve or a patrol was vera 
trawl.

2006
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:49,260
R E S v e r a t e r o l yeah.

2007
01:23:49,710 --> 01:23:54,710
Dioxin.
Very potent antioxidant that exists in 

2008
01:23:54,710 --> 01:23:54,710
wine and I've been taking it for years.

2009
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:56,500
Yeah.
So He's been doing like this huge.

2010
01:23:56,501 --> 01:23:59,050
He's like crazy research guy when he 
gets hooked on something,

2011
01:23:59,230 --> 01:24:04,230
it's actually,
it comes from plants when it's stressed 

2012
01:24:04,230 --> 01:24:04,270
by parasites or various infections like 
the plants,

2013
01:24:04,271 --> 01:24:07,510
like a release like this,
like fucking chemical or whatever.

2014
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:10,540
So people are taking this a chemical and
putting it,

2015
01:24:10,541 --> 01:24:12,550
you know,
you can go to Gnc and stuff,

2016
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:15,910
but then there's kinds that are mixed 
with other things that uh,

2017
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:20,410
but if you get it as pure as possible,
that benefits from it or like insane.

2018
01:24:20,411 --> 01:24:23,710
It's saying that this is all in like 
rats.

2019
01:24:23,770 --> 01:24:28,300
They found that the rats have like 
cancer gone away from it.

2020
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:33,630
A lot that in person routes of cancer,
like bus route and they're saying that 

2021
01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:39,820
it will block colon cancer in humans and
uh,

2022
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,420
it will your life will you be 30 percent
more life.

2023
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:45,430
You live longer and stuff like that.

2024
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:50,580
It's also saying there a difficulty in 
absorption that we were talking about 

2025
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:50,580
this before.
That's what I'm saying.

2026
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:55,231
I've,
I've heard that your body absorbs very 

2027
01:24:55,231 --> 01:24:55,231
little of most of the brands that you 
bought.

2028
01:24:55,231 --> 01:24:57,520
That's a,
you have to find out how pure it is.

2029
01:24:57,670 --> 01:25:02,470
And if you look on the bottle,
look to see how pure it is.

2030
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:05,740
You want about 200 or 2:50
to 500,

2031
01:25:05,741 --> 01:25:10,741
it goes up to $500.
But look how the pure of the actual 

2032
01:25:10,741 --> 01:25:11,440
chemical of that.
So two to 5,500

2033
01:25:12,370 --> 01:25:13,820
milligrams.
Is that what it isn't?

2034
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:17,440
So milligrams milligrams.
So the higher the milligram,

2035
01:25:17,441 --> 01:25:21,580
the more pure it is,
the higher it's just that chemical mixed

2036
01:25:21,581 --> 01:25:26,581
with other things.
So it a mix with what are the other 

2037
01:25:26,581 --> 01:25:26,581
things that they put in with it?
Oh,

2038
01:25:26,581 --> 01:25:27,910
I like grape grape seed extract,
stuff like that.

2039
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:28,990
Yeah,
he is also an anti.

2040
01:25:29,050 --> 01:25:30,020
Have you been taking the Brian?

2041
01:25:30,310 --> 01:25:35,310
I just started in two days,
but my dad's been taking it for about a 

2042
01:25:35,310 --> 01:25:35,530
month now.
And he says a couple things.

2043
01:25:35,531 --> 01:25:40,531
He said that he feels like he is just 
nonstop energy from when he wakes up to 

2044
01:25:40,531 --> 01:25:42,700
something that he hasn't had in years.
He also said that his hip pain,

2045
01:25:42,701 --> 01:25:44,170
he has a bad pain.
He took,

2046
01:25:44,171 --> 01:25:47,260
stopped taking it for a week and his hip
pain immediately came back.

2047
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:48,810
And he also said that,
uh,

2048
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:54,120
uh,
that he has stomach is always getting 

2049
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:54,280
full faster now.
So after we,

2050
01:25:54,380 --> 01:25:56,530
it gets like second side,
a dinner or something like that.

2051
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:00,010
Now he says he feels full after the 
first time your dad selling resveratrol.

2052
01:26:00,011 --> 01:26:03,450
No,
he's not a scam motherfucker.

2053
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:05,930
He's not,
but he's to somebody.

2054
01:26:05,931 --> 01:26:08,470
He's somebody that like when he could 
find something to eat,

2055
01:26:08,510 --> 01:26:11,180
like researches the fuck out of it and 
stuff like that.

2056
01:26:11,190 --> 01:26:12,980
If you said that whole thing in an 
English accent,

2057
01:26:12,981 --> 01:26:15,330
I probably wouldn't get online.
Yeah.

2058
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:20,440
But anyways,
there's a whole thing that I emailed 

2059
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:20,440
you,
Joe,

2060
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:20,840
that you should look for that it out.
Have some in my,

2061
01:26:20,841 --> 01:26:21,690
um,
my,

2062
01:26:21,850 --> 01:26:24,360
my vitamin cabinet.
I don't know,

2063
01:26:24,450 --> 01:26:26,690
I never even looked at what the dosage 
is though.

2064
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:32,200
I mean it says a blocks,
colon cancer in mice and then right now 

2065
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:33,110
that they're trying to find out that the
problem is we're not mice.

2066
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:34,100
Yeah.
Well we're mammals.

2067
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:36,130
We're mammals.
So they're,

2068
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:40,610
they're looking into it and a lot of the
research are finding is all positive.

2069
01:26:40,611 --> 01:26:42,890
Interesting.
I'm sure there's definitely a connection

2070
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:47,920
with camp,
but there's a lot of shit that mammals 

2071
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:47,920
can eat that we can't and we can't,
that they can.

2072
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:50,360
Like dogs can't even eat chocolate.
Dark chocolate.

2073
01:26:50,420 --> 01:26:52,310
They'll get fucked up.
Shit's poisoned.

2074
01:26:52,311 --> 01:26:57,311
Poisoned.
Did her stomach kill them and if you 

2075
01:26:57,311 --> 01:26:57,311
give a sheep,
DMT,

2076
01:26:57,311 --> 01:26:58,850
they die.
You know that sheep,

2077
01:26:58,851 --> 01:27:01,370
there's certain types of grass that has 
dmt in it.

2078
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:05,120
She eat the grass and they just fucking 
fall down the little feet,

2079
01:27:05,150 --> 01:27:07,670
just twitch in the air.
It just boom.

2080
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:12,080
Explode their brain.
If you put a snail on a listerine strip,

2081
01:27:12,081 --> 01:27:13,100
they melt.
Yeah,

2082
01:27:13,101 --> 01:27:14,930
but listerine strips on the nature,
son.

2083
01:27:15,860 --> 01:27:17,410
That's ridiculous.
Well,

2084
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:20,450
if you flipped,
hit a monkey with a rocky dies,

2085
01:27:23,090 --> 01:27:27,080
Huh?
That's all my dad.

2086
01:27:27,081 --> 01:27:32,081
My Dad's the one that first told me 
there were about splendor like seven 

2087
01:27:32,081 --> 01:27:34,811
years ago.
How about all the bad shit about bad 

2088
01:27:34,811 --> 01:27:34,811
when people are just getting on splenda.
He was like,

2089
01:27:34,811 --> 01:27:37,350
send me reports about how the brain like
things like sugar,

2090
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,890
and this is seven years ago he was 
sending me this shit.

2091
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,380
So He's pretty coke.
The sucralose.

2092
01:27:42,381 --> 01:27:43,520
One's a weird one,
right?

2093
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:47,180
Splenda what?
SPLENDA as any of those chemicals tricks

2094
01:27:47,181 --> 01:27:52,181
the brain into thinking it's sugar,
so it does the ship that it does do 

2095
01:27:52,181 --> 01:27:53,060
fight a burn off the sugar,
but it's not there,

2096
01:27:53,150 --> 01:27:58,150
so it's just.
I guess it has a lot of bad negative 

2097
01:27:58,150 --> 01:27:58,150
side effects.
It's pretty critical.

2098
01:27:58,250 --> 01:27:59,600
Aspartame is a bunch of them now.

2099
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:06,640
I don't think any of them.
I think actually sugar is probably the 

2100
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:06,640
best.
The best one for you.

2101
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:08,150
That's why a lot of these companies 
though.

2102
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:09,890
Here's the key.
You got to exercise.

2103
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:15,020
You can't just eat sugary shit and if 
you're going to have one of those 

2104
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:15,020
things,
you have to have a body that can process

2105
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:19,871
that sugar.
You can't just be sedentary and be down 

2106
01:28:19,871 --> 01:28:22,801
in sugary drinks that will fuck your 
whole system and want everything in 

2107
01:28:22,801 --> 01:28:22,801
moderation.
Yeah.

2108
01:28:22,801 --> 01:28:24,170
There's nothing wrong.
A little coke in moderation.

2109
01:28:24,370 --> 01:28:25,880
The drink.
Yeah.

2110
01:28:25,881 --> 01:28:28,940
Lately I've been buying those small 
little mini regulatory fuck cock sucker.

2111
01:28:28,941 --> 01:28:30,260
Why you looking at me?
You know?

2112
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:32,740
I don't know.
It'll.

2113
01:28:33,070 --> 01:28:36,680
It'll totally because I wanted to a diet
coke for awhile.

2114
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:40,630
Terry bought like 95 of a costco.
I stuck to my points.

2115
01:28:40,660 --> 01:28:44,600
They actually gave away fucking sodium 
is.

2116
01:28:44,630 --> 01:28:49,630
Oh yeah,
you've got so much water with kidding 

2117
01:28:49,630 --> 01:28:49,630
me.
So now I've been,

2118
01:28:49,630 --> 01:28:53,080
I got off of that.
I just drink them when I go to a 

2119
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:55,061
restaurant.
And even then I don't because I feel 

2120
01:28:55,061 --> 01:28:55,061
that they only gave me the wrong batch 
of shit.

2121
01:28:55,061 --> 01:28:55,061
Right.
So I stopped,

2122
01:28:55,061 --> 01:28:59,920
you know,
because I just don't want it at all 

2123
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,760
right now.
Have you been following e three at all 

2124
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:02,010
this week,
Joe and seen all the

2125
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:04,890
new shit that's coming out with Xbox,
Sony and all that stuff?

2126
01:29:04,950 --> 01:29:05,790
No,
I saw the,

2127
01:29:05,791 --> 01:29:06,200
uh,
the,

2128
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:08,080
they made the xbox smaller,
but I mean,

2129
01:29:08,090 --> 01:29:10,380
what are they going to do?
This really interesting new things.

2130
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:15,400
It's like they're all turning into the 
Nintendo wi with the motion controllers 

2131
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:15,690
and stuff.
But what's really cool is like,

2132
01:29:15,691 --> 01:29:20,691
Sony has this one which is like it,
like it looks like a microphone or a 

2133
01:29:20,691 --> 01:29:23,421
fleshlight or whatever,
but in the game you're like in the game 

2134
01:29:23,421 --> 01:29:24,120
and then it turns your controller into a
weapon.

2135
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:26,190
Kind of like,
you know how cgi they have like the Ping

2136
01:29:26,191 --> 01:29:31,191
pongs all over and stuff,
so you're looking at yourself with a 

2137
01:29:31,191 --> 01:29:31,191
weapon and it's Kinda,
it's Kinda trippy.

2138
01:29:31,230 --> 01:29:36,230
So like that's the whole thing with the 
xbox and the ps three is that it's 

2139
01:29:36,230 --> 01:29:37,860
turning you into the controller.
But I think I'm sick of all this.

2140
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:39,270
I just want to play video games.
I,

2141
01:29:39,271 --> 01:29:40,500
you know,
I'm a grown man.

2142
01:29:40,501 --> 01:29:44,790
I don't need to be dancing around just 
trying to fucking cast spells on dragons

2143
01:29:44,791 --> 01:29:46,920
and stuff for a lot of people they've 
lost a lot of weight.

2144
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:47,400
Oh yeah,
yeah.

2145
01:29:47,401 --> 01:29:47,820
For,
for,

2146
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:48,990
for,
for people,

2147
01:29:48,991 --> 01:29:51,300
for young kids.
I'm sure they're loving this shit,

2148
01:29:51,330 --> 01:29:52,890
but you know,
we fit,

2149
01:29:53,210 --> 01:29:58,210
we fit shit.
A lot of people have lost a lot of 

2150
01:29:58,210 --> 01:29:59,901
weight with that stuff and they also,
Nintendo just released a new three d 

2151
01:29:59,901 --> 01:29:59,901
game.
Boy that I,

2152
01:29:59,901 --> 01:30:01,350
I don't think you have to have glasses 
for.

2153
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:02,850
Maybe you do,
but I don't think you do.

2154
01:30:02,851 --> 01:30:05,370
And they said that it's actually coming 
out.

2155
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:07,080
Wow.
What about like,

2156
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:08,460
that's,
that's crazy man.

2157
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,650
What about that Microsoft thing?
There was a Microsoft thing.

2158
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:12,870
They're working on,
that was a,

2159
01:30:13,230 --> 01:30:18,230
it was a emotion detective thing that 
we're going to be able to do with 

2160
01:30:18,230 --> 01:30:18,230
martial arts game.

2161
01:30:18,230 --> 01:30:18,230
Yeah,
that's it.

2162
01:30:18,230 --> 01:30:19,320
That's one of the things.
That's what I believe it's called a,

2163
01:30:19,321 --> 01:30:21,210
I forget what it's called now.
Vizio or something.

2164
01:30:21,211 --> 01:30:22,800
I can't remember.
But uh,

2165
01:30:23,220 --> 01:30:25,860
so that's,
that's my xbox version,

2166
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:27,120
you know,
I think they both,

2167
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,520
they have both a positive so I'm going 
to get it.

2168
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:34,550
They're cheap.
They're $49 for the ps three and 

2169
01:30:34,550 --> 01:30:34,550
something I think we're ever going to 
get to reality helmets,

2170
01:30:34,550 --> 01:30:36,360
you know,
like alternate reality helmets.

2171
01:30:37,110 --> 01:30:42,110
Remember when they had those,
when they were trying to do that for 

2172
01:30:42,110 --> 01:30:42,950
awhile though.
The virtual reality there were there,

2173
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:47,980
there was like a big thing like that.
Someday we're going to be able to put a 

2174
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:48,900
helmet on and you'll know if it's going 
to be like that.

2175
01:30:48,901 --> 01:30:50,100
I was,
when I was in Vegas,

2176
01:30:50,101 --> 01:30:51,030
I was talking to all these,
uh,

2177
01:30:51,031 --> 01:30:56,031
there was a tech conference going on 
there and this guy I know from San 

2178
01:30:56,031 --> 01:30:57,840
Francisco owns this whole company and he
was telling me about what was big in the

2179
01:30:57,841 --> 01:30:59,550
tech shows and he says,
you know,

2180
01:30:59,551 --> 01:31:01,140
the big thing that's going to be next,
he's like,

2181
01:31:01,141 --> 01:31:04,530
porn is kind of at a dead right now with
no dvds,

2182
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:06,270
fucking porn.

2183
01:31:06,580 --> 01:31:08,580
So red porn.
He says,

2184
01:31:08,581 --> 01:31:10,850
he says some of the technologies coming 
out,

2185
01:31:10,870 --> 01:31:12,080
Yo.
He's like,

2186
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:12,600
he's like,
you know,

2187
01:31:12,601 --> 01:31:15,660
that's going to be big where you can 
just lay in bed with no pants on and you

2188
01:31:15,661 --> 01:31:17,680
feel like the legs are wrapping around 
you,

2189
01:31:17,681 --> 01:31:22,681
you know,
and you're fucking sitting there with 

2190
01:31:22,681 --> 01:31:22,681
their flashlight on and you're immersed 
into it like a helmet.

2191
01:31:22,681 --> 01:31:23,090
He's like,
that's what's going to be big.

2192
01:31:23,130 --> 01:31:25,380
He said the TVS weren't even that 
impressive.

2193
01:31:25,381 --> 01:31:30,381
He said,
what was impressive this year at this 

2194
01:31:30,381 --> 01:31:30,900
convention was the digital projection,
three Ds.

2195
01:31:31,050 --> 01:31:32,880
He says,
that was just amazing.

2196
01:31:32,890 --> 01:31:34,890
That's like some help me.
It will be one time shit.

2197
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:35,960
Kind of.
Yeah.

2198
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,880
Imagine having this whole wall behind 
you be three d,

2199
01:31:38,881 --> 01:31:43,881
You know,
you're just fucking sitting there in 

2200
01:31:43,881 --> 01:31:45,141
this chair over here and you feel like 
you are in Lord of the rings or 

2201
01:31:45,141 --> 01:31:45,141
whatever.
Yeah,

2202
01:31:45,141 --> 01:31:46,860
you got to flinch and next thing is 
going to be way more immersive.

2203
01:31:46,890 --> 01:31:49,800
Every step is coming to watch.
The TV is going to be your wall and it's

2204
01:31:49,801 --> 01:31:54,801
probably gonna.
Be Greedy when it moves past the flat 

2205
01:31:54,801 --> 01:31:57,530
plane,
that's when it's going to get really 

2206
01:31:57,530 --> 01:31:59,181
crazy.
When somehow know that they figured out 

2207
01:31:59,181 --> 01:32:00,921
a way to bring you more into the action.
Some some invention that allows you to 

2208
01:32:00,921 --> 01:32:00,921
be

2209
01:32:00,921 --> 01:32:02,590
like a virtual reality type situation 
when you watch movies.

2210
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:07,620
So the guy said at that convention they 
had a 40 inch tv that didn't require 

2211
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:08,710
glasses.
He said it kind of sucked,

2212
01:32:08,950 --> 01:32:13,950
but he said he saw just looking at it 
how eventually that is going to be huge 

2213
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:15,880
and it's going to be three d,
so it's going to add a depth.

2214
01:32:15,881 --> 01:32:18,180
So you walk into your room,
you could have a picture on the wall,

2215
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:19,330
this long hallway,
and you're gonna.

2216
01:32:19,331 --> 01:32:21,010
Feel like that's a long hallway in your 
room.

2217
01:32:21,011 --> 01:32:26,011
You know what I mean?
There was a thing I went to at the 

2218
01:32:26,011 --> 01:32:28,201
planetarium the other day was one of 
those science shows where you lie on 

2219
01:32:28,201 --> 01:32:30,931
your back and they take on a tour of the
all the different astrological 

2220
01:32:30,931 --> 01:32:34,860
configurations in the sky and 
constellations and stuff and so they 

2221
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:38,061
were.
They were taking you on this tour and 

2222
01:32:38,061 --> 01:32:38,061
all this different shit and space and 
everything.

2223
01:32:38,061 --> 01:32:38,470
I was like,
how intense is this?

2224
01:32:38,471 --> 01:32:42,220
Like the whole ceiling is a fucking 
screen and you're lying back.

2225
01:32:42,650 --> 01:32:44,980
Like almost like a lazy boy chair.
You lay all the way back.

2226
01:32:44,981 --> 01:32:47,680
Like I fell asleep even so I was tired 
when I was there.

2227
01:32:48,450 --> 01:32:49,990
I'm an old man.
I fall asleep with the movies,

2228
01:32:50,220 --> 01:32:52,750
so I'm standing up there watching this 
fucking thing and I'm like,

2229
01:32:52,751 --> 01:32:55,360
well this is so much more immersive than
television.

2230
01:32:55,530 --> 01:32:57,640
Like that's what the next step is going 
to be.

2231
01:32:57,641 --> 01:32:59,260
It's going to be like,
you're going to go to the movies,

2232
01:32:59,261 --> 01:33:01,120
but the movie is going to be like a 
ride.

2233
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:02,800
You know what I'm saying?
It's going to be like some space,

2234
01:33:02,801 --> 01:33:07,801
mountain type shit.
It's not going to just going to be used 

2235
01:33:07,801 --> 01:33:08,170
sitting there and everybody gets 
strapped into a seat and you know,

2236
01:33:08,220 --> 01:33:13,220
you put a helmet on captain fucking 
chair moves and Shit and you go on a 

2237
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:13,630
ride through the movie.

2238
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:19,180
I think they have similar things 
probably already at like Disney and 

2239
01:33:19,180 --> 01:33:22,631
stuff,
but not only for a couple minutes till 

2240
01:33:22,631 --> 01:33:22,631
the ride starts,
you know,

2241
01:33:22,631 --> 01:33:22,950
but the.
Oh,

2242
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:24,610
did you ever go in the Jurassic Park 
ride?

2243
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:27,580
Jurassic Park rides a dope one.
They have.

2244
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:29,920
That's one of those.
I think that's the one I'm thinking of.

2245
01:33:30,090 --> 01:33:31,880
It's a.
it's almost all our score.

2246
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:32,110
No,
no,

2247
01:33:32,111 --> 01:33:33,250
no.
It's not Jurassic Park.

2248
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:36,730
There was another one that they had and 
that was old school has a robocop shit.

2249
01:33:36,731 --> 01:33:38,340
I don't know what the fuck.
No,

2250
01:33:38,590 --> 01:33:41,200
there was one I feel maybe it is dressed
park where there's the one.

2251
01:33:41,201 --> 01:33:44,350
They had a universal studios that was 
all three d.

2252
01:33:44,370 --> 01:33:46,150
It was.
It was all rather a virtual.

2253
01:33:46,151 --> 01:33:48,750
You're in a chair and the chair moves in
you and you go on this adventure,

2254
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:51,070
but it doesn't last very long.
I don't remember which one it was,

2255
01:33:51,430 --> 01:33:52,840
but it was one of those ones where 
you're like,

2256
01:33:52,841 --> 01:33:54,530
wow,
someday this is going to be what movies?

2257
01:33:54,530 --> 01:33:56,340
You're like,
no,

2258
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:01,210
we need a fucking three d avatar.
Need this rather a blue avatar.

2259
01:34:01,211 --> 01:34:03,550
Vagina needed.
We need to really contact them.

2260
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:09,020
Don't they need to kick that up a notch?
That would be a big seller amongst the 

2261
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:09,020
geeks.
The new.

2262
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:09,310
We've got to do this,
man.

2263
01:34:09,490 --> 01:34:11,980
You got to do a get in touch with James 
Cameron.

2264
01:34:11,981 --> 01:34:15,040
I'm sure he'll agree with me.
You get smurfette pussy one of the two.

2265
01:34:15,130 --> 01:34:16,710
Just don't tell them it's an Avatar.
Pussy.

2266
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:21,750
Just he won't agree to it with the 
little sparkles of some little glitter 

2267
01:34:21,821 --> 01:34:23,840
on that pussy.
The new,

2268
01:34:23,860 --> 01:34:28,860
um,
the new Jack asses in three d and which 

2269
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:29,290
is kind of gross and weird about that.
But you know what?

2270
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:34,320
Here's the thing,
I have this problem where Johnny 

2271
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,520
Knoxville or Bam or none of those people
have been on in the news at all for like

2272
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:36,940
years,
it seems like,

2273
01:34:36,941 --> 01:34:39,580
you know,
now in the last week on TMZ,

2274
01:34:39,581 --> 01:34:41,140
they've been in the news like four 
times,

2275
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:43,810
you know,
and I'm almost wondering if this is just

2276
01:34:43,811 --> 01:34:48,610
all promotion for the new movie because 
smart guy you got beat up.

2277
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:49,900
Isn't that what could happen?
All that.

2278
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:56,260
But the problem is someone got arrested,
someone got arrested and it's on the 

2279
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:56,260
news,
right?

2280
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:57,520
Here's an $80 ticket or whatever.
First assault,

2281
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:03,250
attempted murder.
She hit him in the head with a baseball 

2282
01:35:03,250 --> 01:35:05,501
bat.
It was like some serious assault 

2283
01:35:05,501 --> 01:35:05,750
charges.
Some 59 year old woman baseball batted.

2284
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:10,780
Bam.
Mark Air outside his bar in 

2285
01:35:10,780 --> 01:35:12,521
Pennsylvania.
How much you all that follow that shit 

2286
01:35:12,521 --> 01:35:13,490
and see what happens.
I'll let that girl finally gets Ryan.

2287
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:14,900
So cynical,
but so right.

2288
01:35:14,990 --> 01:35:17,100
So right.
So often you're right.

2289
01:35:17,110 --> 01:35:22,110
A lot of tell you that fellow you've 
called a lot of fake things and I was 

2290
01:35:22,110 --> 01:35:22,110
like,
10 ain't fake.

2291
01:35:22,110 --> 01:35:22,170
Fake,
fake,

2292
01:35:22,510 --> 01:35:23,210
fake.
You get angry.

2293
01:35:23,211 --> 01:35:23,960
Fake.
Well,

2294
01:35:23,961 --> 01:35:25,970
what's crazy is when tmz first announced
it,

2295
01:35:25,971 --> 01:35:27,920
they were like,
he's in critical icu condition,

2296
01:35:27,921 --> 01:35:28,240
you know,
blah,

2297
01:35:28,241 --> 01:35:29,800
Blah is looking bad,
and then the next thing is like,

2298
01:35:30,050 --> 01:35:31,520
oh,
just talk to Johnny Knoxville.

2299
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,380
He said he was like,
he was a heavier.

2300
01:35:33,381 --> 01:35:34,670
Yeah.
What was,

2301
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:36,500
what were some of the fakes that you've 
called in the past?

2302
01:35:36,501 --> 01:35:39,830
You've called it quite a few fix where 
you were way ahead of the curve.

2303
01:35:39,950 --> 01:35:44,950
Well,
there was one that there was like this 

2304
01:35:44,950 --> 01:35:46,541
really horrible fight and somebody had 
filmed it and it looked like a dude was 

2305
01:35:46,541 --> 01:35:48,290
punching the guy fight.
See,

2306
01:35:48,291 --> 01:35:53,291
I think the added sound effects to a 
real fight totally added sound effects 

2307
01:35:53,291 --> 01:35:56,711
to a real fight and it looked really bad
because it was the same noise didn't 

2308
01:35:56,711 --> 01:35:56,870
sync over again.
It was not sinked up.

2309
01:35:56,930 --> 01:35:59,240
I blew up that video so you can see 
where the hit,

2310
01:35:59,270 --> 01:36:01,250
you know that's true.
But I,

2311
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:04,430
I recognized from years and years of 
watching dudes get fucked up.

2312
01:36:04,431 --> 01:36:09,431
That was real.
That guy got punted in the head when he 

2313
01:36:09,431 --> 01:36:09,431
was unconscious and his whole body move 
dead.

2314
01:36:09,431 --> 01:36:09,830
I mean,
what?

2315
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:14,930
It was a real,
I don't think I ever told you I found 

2316
01:36:14,930 --> 01:36:18,101
out what happened about that video was 
actually made for one of those shocking 

2317
01:36:18,101 --> 01:36:21,701
TV things.
They had like America's funniest home 

2318
01:36:21,701 --> 01:36:21,701
videos.
Like ads,

2319
01:36:21,701 --> 01:36:23,230
like oh no,
invoices and stuff.

2320
01:36:23,650 --> 01:36:25,550
They pump it up.
That's another thing.

2321
01:36:25,551 --> 01:36:26,570
By the way,
I'm gonna.

2322
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:29,210
Have you guys ever seen this?
Like America's funniest home videos.

2323
01:36:29,211 --> 01:36:32,180
Don't do it as much,
but any of those like sending your video

2324
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:37,620
type shows if you really pay attention,
they don't want to pay people and stuff 

2325
01:36:37,620 --> 01:36:42,551
like that for certain things.
So like most of the voices are all done 

2326
01:36:42,551 --> 01:36:42,551
by the same guy.
So it's like,

2327
01:36:42,551 --> 01:36:43,790
hey honey,
come over here and look at this.

2328
01:36:43,850 --> 01:36:46,190
And then you see here the same guy,
like two videos there go,

2329
01:36:46,250 --> 01:36:47,660
oh honey,
look at how you know,

2330
01:36:47,661 --> 01:36:51,170
and then you realize it's just one dude 
and it ruins the whole show for you.

2331
01:36:51,170 --> 01:36:53,390
So next time you watch one lady's like 
video shows,

2332
01:36:53,510 --> 01:36:58,510
listen to the voices.
It's just one guy redoing all these 

2333
01:36:58,510 --> 01:36:58,510
weights.
Like,

2334
01:36:58,510 --> 01:36:58,510
oh no,
look at this.

2335
01:36:58,510 --> 01:36:59,810
And you can tell us the same guy.
It's horrible.

2336
01:36:59,870 --> 01:37:03,620
Brian's ruining childhood memories,
crushing dreams,

2337
01:37:03,621 --> 01:37:06,350
right about Carlos conduit.
What the fuck.

2338
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:09,200
Fucking Wolf,
Carlos Condit and Roy Mcdonald.

2339
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:13,760
What our fucking fight.
Battle Royale kid is a first of all,

2340
01:37:13,790 --> 01:37:17,510
props to Carlos condit for coming back 
after those first two rounds.

2341
01:37:17,511 --> 01:37:19,010
The first few rounds he was getting 
beat.

2342
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:20,590
He was getting taken down.
He,

2343
01:37:20,650 --> 01:37:22,100
you know,
he's getting clipped a little bit on his

2344
01:37:22,101 --> 01:37:27,101
feet,
but he tacked our kid quite a few times 

2345
01:37:27,101 --> 01:37:27,101
too.
The kid know kid took some big shots.

2346
01:37:27,101 --> 01:37:27,920
There are a lot of people are saying 
like,

2347
01:37:27,921 --> 01:37:29,840
you can't take a punch and like you're 
crazy calls.

2348
01:37:29,850 --> 01:37:32,390
Conduit rocked him on the button and he 
was coming forward.

2349
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:37,600
I mean,
no one takes good shots when they're 

2350
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:37,600
coming forward.
You know when you're coming forward,

2351
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:38,120
that's when you can get hurt and you 
know,

2352
01:37:38,180 --> 01:37:39,680
they,
they had a rock 'em sock.

2353
01:37:39,681 --> 01:37:42,530
'Em robots fight and then Carlos condit 
pulled it out at the end,

2354
01:37:42,770 --> 01:37:44,930
got them down and just start blasting 
them with elbows.

2355
01:37:44,931 --> 01:37:47,070
Man hit him with some hard left.
Oh God.

2356
01:37:47,130 --> 01:37:49,450
It was his eye up.
And you know what?

2357
01:37:49,490 --> 01:37:53,270
The kid has massive class man after.
It was over and I interviewed him.

2358
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:55,860
He was so classy,
like the way he handled it,

2359
01:37:55,861 --> 01:37:55,980
there

2360
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:57,840
was no ego,
no bullshit.

2361
01:37:57,841 --> 01:37:58,770
The kid was like,
you know,

2362
01:37:58,771 --> 01:38:01,170
when he kicked my ass,
who's the toughest guy I ever fought?

2363
01:38:01,171 --> 01:38:02,200
You know,
I was asking them,

2364
01:38:02,230 --> 01:38:04,680
do you think the fight was stopped 
prematurely?

2365
01:38:04,950 --> 01:38:05,610
He was like,
no,

2366
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:06,750
no.
He was kicking my ass,

2367
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:11,780
you know,
the kid was just ultimate class and 

2368
01:38:11,780 --> 01:38:11,780
honesty and just the way he handled 
himself,

2369
01:38:11,780 --> 01:38:16,610
you know,
and he's so fucking talented and he's 

2370
01:38:16,610 --> 01:38:16,610
like one of the first cars being 20 
years old.

2371
01:38:16,610 --> 01:38:20,601
He's one of the first guys that started 
out training mma that started out as a 

2372
01:38:20,601 --> 01:38:23,901
wrestler or a or whatever.
He started out learning the whole sport 

2373
01:38:23,901 --> 01:38:25,590
altogether as one thing.
So it's pretty impressive to watch that.

2374
01:38:25,591 --> 01:38:28,560
That kid's got a super busy,
you know,

2375
01:38:28,561 --> 01:38:33,561
you could tell.
What have you heard about the first 

2376
01:38:33,561 --> 01:38:33,561
fight?
That was anything,

2377
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:34,260
unfortunately.
Yeah,

2378
01:38:34,261 --> 01:38:34,920
they're gonna Redo it.

2379
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:36,710
They'll definitely do it.
Fence.

2380
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:38,550
Dana knows the fans wanted to see that 
fight again.

2381
01:38:38,551 --> 01:38:40,380
That was just a mistake.
You've made a mistake.

2382
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:41,550
It happens,
man.

2383
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:44,910
Being a referee is very hard to avoid.
Tyson Griffin.

2384
01:38:44,911 --> 01:38:46,710
That was a good fight.
That was a great asset grid.

2385
01:38:47,170 --> 01:38:51,030
That Kid Evan Dunham is a study that is.
He's fucking good.

2386
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:53,520
These are great fights to sweet,
but standup is good.

2387
01:38:53,550 --> 01:38:58,550
His fucking Jujitsu's good.
How dare do they think of in the middle 

2388
01:38:58,550 --> 01:39:00,750
of the Goddamn POC.
They knew that they shut that shit off.

2389
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:06,200
That's probably my manager.
She's probably thinking about like 

2390
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:06,270
calling me to tell me that you're 
talking about the flashlight too much.

2391
01:39:10,980 --> 01:39:12,540
That was a good.
Anyway,

2392
01:39:12,541 --> 01:39:14,470
that was a good fucking car.
There was some good pricing.

2393
01:39:15,870 --> 01:39:17,290
What's up with pat?
Barry's shit.

2394
01:39:17,291 --> 01:39:19,380
He broke.
He broke his foot and he broke his hand.

2395
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:24,560
He broke his neck when he punched cro.
Cop in the first round and then dropped 

2396
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:24,740
them.
The second punch he hit him with,

2397
01:39:24,741 --> 01:39:25,980
he said he felt is not going to give 
out.

2398
01:39:26,010 --> 01:39:31,010
And then he uh,
apparently broke his foot somewhere in 

2399
01:39:31,010 --> 01:39:33,171
the fight to his foot.
Swole up like an elephant foot took 

2400
01:39:33,171 --> 01:39:35,960
pictures of it online.
Like he has the two feet together and 

2401
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:35,960
one of them's like literally twice the 
size.

2402
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:36,960
It's nasty,
but a great fight though.

2403
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:37,980
Woo.
That was fun.

2404
01:39:38,490 --> 01:39:43,490
That was a fun fight and fun.
Comeback to watching cro cop turn it on 

2405
01:39:43,490 --> 01:39:44,820
at the end of Glasgow and then take us 
back and choke him and then Cro,

2406
01:39:44,821 --> 01:39:46,650
cop campaign for the submission of the 
night.

2407
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:48,130
That was a good article.
Yeah.

2408
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:49,830
Tell him what do you call them?
Strategy.

2409
01:39:50,660 --> 01:39:52,340
I don't remember what he said,
but it was funny.

2410
01:39:52,710 --> 01:39:53,730
There was a for him,
man.

2411
01:39:53,731 --> 01:39:55,800
I hope that's his last fight.
I really do.

2412
01:39:55,801 --> 01:39:57,120
Because he's been talking about 
retiring.

2413
01:39:57,180 --> 01:40:02,180
I hope he chooses to go out that way.
It's nice to see a guy go out on a high 

2414
01:40:02,180 --> 01:40:02,180
note,
you know,

2415
01:40:02,180 --> 01:40:03,210
that was a high note.
That was an awesome performance.

2416
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:08,420
At the end he addressed the crowd and 
address the Croatian fans and it's 

2417
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:08,700
pretty cool.
I gave him the microphone.

2418
01:40:08,701 --> 01:40:09,990
Yeah,
I just gave it to him.

2419
01:40:09,991 --> 01:40:12,690
I mean it was just,
it felt like I said something to him.

2420
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:17,840
He was so proud and so happy and he 
could feel and I was happy for the guy 

2421
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:21,230
and the crowd was going nuts and 
everybody was happy and I said I looked 

2422
01:40:21,230 --> 01:40:24,951
down,
I saw was Croatian flags and I remember 

2423
01:40:24,951 --> 01:40:26,991
him talking about how many Croatian fans
are going to be here in Vancouver 

2424
01:40:26,991 --> 01:40:27,420
because a lot of Croatian people lived 
there and I said,

2425
01:40:27,421 --> 01:40:29,950
do you have anything to say to your a 
Croatian fans out there?

2426
01:40:29,970 --> 01:40:34,970
See,
you got a lot of support and the crowd 

2427
01:40:34,970 --> 01:40:36,261
goes nuts.
All the correlations go fucking ape 

2428
01:40:36,261 --> 01:40:36,261
shit.
And then I just knew I was going to give

2429
01:40:36,261 --> 01:40:36,840
him the mic and he knew I was going to 
give him the mic.

2430
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:39,000
I didn't say anything to him.
He didn't say anything to me.

2431
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:40,800
I just,
I just handed him the mic and he took it

2432
01:40:40,801 --> 01:40:45,801
and he started walking and pacing and 
talking in his native language and the 

2433
01:40:45,801 --> 01:40:45,960
crowd went nuts.
It was just a beautiful ending.

2434
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:46,620
You know,
if he,

2435
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,840
if he decides that he doesn't want to 
compete anymore,

2436
01:40:48,841 --> 01:40:49,410
I mean,
who knows?

2437
01:40:49,411 --> 01:40:54,411
He might decide.
He might be saying that now because it 

2438
01:40:54,411 --> 01:40:54,411
was a lot of stress,
but they'll get up and get back in there

2439
01:40:54,411 --> 01:40:56,410
again because it was one of his best 
performances in a long time.

2440
01:40:56,411 --> 01:40:58,390
He looked real good,
especially in that third round.

2441
01:40:58,570 --> 01:41:03,570
You know when he,
when he had barry backed up and he was 

2442
01:41:03,570 --> 01:41:03,570
nailing and with punches.
He was,

2443
01:41:03,570 --> 01:41:04,600
he was looking sharp dude.
He was nailing them.

2444
01:41:04,601 --> 01:41:05,920
What's the fucking hands,
you know?

2445
01:41:06,220 --> 01:41:06,970
So who knows,
man.

2446
01:41:06,971 --> 01:41:11,971
He might decide.
He might decide to keep it light and 

2447
01:41:11,971 --> 01:41:11,971
heartbreak.
My doubt broke my fucking heart,

2448
01:41:11,971 --> 01:41:11,971
man.

2449
01:41:11,971 --> 01:41:12,410
Well,
it's good,

2450
01:41:12,970 --> 01:41:15,260
but this does seem to me.
It seems like it's happened.

2451
01:41:15,261 --> 01:41:16,880
Like the last three fights.
It's broken my heart.

2452
01:41:16,881 --> 01:41:18,860
I thought I didn't know he was even 
going to fight again.

2453
01:41:18,861 --> 01:41:19,490
I was like,
really?

2454
01:41:19,491 --> 01:41:20,930
I mean,
because he's been getting knocked out.

2455
01:41:20,931 --> 01:41:22,440
What the last three fights he got 
knocked down.

2456
01:41:22,441 --> 01:41:23,690
Yes.
I mean it's like,

2457
01:41:23,750 --> 01:41:26,030
I think it's.
Oh,

2458
01:41:26,090 --> 01:41:26,190
got.

2459
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:29,100
Well you got to look at it two ways.
One way is the last four fights actually

2460
01:41:29,370 --> 01:41:32,840
now he had one in there with vandelay in
between and they keep charging.

2461
01:41:32,850 --> 01:41:34,820
One actually was after the rampage last 
two weeks for two.

2462
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:35,840
Um,
you,

2463
01:41:35,850 --> 01:41:37,110
you got to look at it two ways.
One,

2464
01:41:37,111 --> 01:41:42,111
you got to look at it.
The fact that the guys fighting top 

2465
01:41:42,111 --> 01:41:42,111
level talent,
I mean,

2466
01:41:42,111 --> 01:41:45,470
rampage knocked him out.
He got knocked out by Rashad and he got 

2467
01:41:45,470 --> 01:41:48,750
knocked out by Shogun and he got knocked
out by ace rich Franklin.

2468
01:41:48,751 --> 01:41:51,060
So you've got to think about these are,
those are four killers,

2469
01:41:51,090 --> 01:41:52,500
you know?
Yeah.

2470
01:41:52,740 --> 01:41:54,000
It's,
it's unfortunate.

2471
01:41:54,001 --> 01:41:54,530
Yeah.
It's,

2472
01:41:54,531 --> 01:41:56,910
it's very hard to watch him lose like 
that.

2473
01:41:56,911 --> 01:41:58,700
Especially when you grew up like,
you know,

2474
01:41:58,740 --> 01:42:01,070
basically I came up in the UFC,
watched that guy fight.

2475
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:06,120
One of the first,
the first fight that he ever had in 

2476
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:06,120
1998.

2477
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:06,120
I was there live.
I saw him fighting.

2478
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:10,910
I think he fought.
I think the dude's name was Louis 

2479
01:42:10,910 --> 01:42:13,170
Hernandez know Econ Zalas knowing,
knowing your man is no Hernandez.

2480
01:42:13,171 --> 01:42:18,171
Those,
the comedian Louis Gonzalez is the 

2481
01:42:18,171 --> 01:42:18,171
comedian.
So it's known as the fighter.

2482
01:42:18,171 --> 01:42:18,171
Right?
The Guy,

2483
01:42:18,171 --> 01:42:19,950
the guy had really said that too.
I always go,

2484
01:42:19,951 --> 01:42:21,420
what?
He fought a boxer,

2485
01:42:21,421 --> 01:42:26,421
a real good boxer,
and it was a good fucking fight and I'd 

2486
01:42:26,421 --> 01:42:26,700
seen a bunch of chuck's fights.
I saw the fight that he had.

2487
01:42:26,701 --> 01:42:31,701
I wasn't there live of course,
but I saw the fight that he had in 

2488
01:42:31,701 --> 01:42:34,011
Brazil against Palae in Valley Tudo.
This is back when Paleo was in its 

2489
01:42:34,011 --> 01:42:37,731
prime.
Paleo was one of the baddest 

2490
01:42:37,731 --> 01:42:39,171
motherfucking Muay Thai guys to ever 
come out of Brazil and he's one of the 

2491
01:42:39,171 --> 01:42:42,051
guys that helped train Anderson Silva 
and he was the best shoot box guy 

2492
01:42:42,051 --> 01:42:43,560
knocked out Matt Hughes when he knocked 
out a lot of dudes.

2493
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:44,910
He was a killer.
So anyway,

2494
01:42:44,930 --> 01:42:47,220
Palae his fight and chocolate,
Dell,

2495
01:42:47,250 --> 01:42:50,550
any fucking head kick?
Some ba boom.

2496
01:42:50,570 --> 01:42:52,680
I mean with a shot that would kill a 
normal man.

2497
01:42:52,860 --> 01:42:54,990
Chuckles down,
gets right back up.

2498
01:42:55,170 --> 01:42:56,400
He had kicked him twice.
Now.

2499
01:42:56,401 --> 01:42:57,570
Fight and dropped them in the end.
The fight.

2500
01:42:57,660 --> 01:42:59,970
Chuck's on top of them beat the fucking 
shit out of him.

2501
01:43:00,150 --> 01:43:03,090
Bare knuckle into the netting on the 
bottom of the rope.

2502
01:43:03,091 --> 01:43:04,920
The bottom of the rope has a net.
Okay,

2503
01:43:04,921 --> 01:43:07,560
so that you can't slide out.
So you've got to get stuck in there,

2504
01:43:07,561 --> 01:43:12,561
take your beating.
So Chuck's on top of them just fucking 

2505
01:43:12,561 --> 01:43:12,561
punched him in the face.
I mean,

2506
01:43:12,561 --> 01:43:14,820
it was a bare knuckle old school.
No rules war.

2507
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:17,070
I mean this is the kind of fight to that
guy was involved in.

2508
01:43:17,310 --> 01:43:20,370
He wasn't just involved in the UFC five 
rounds,

2509
01:43:20,630 --> 01:43:22,170
you know,
for the championship title,

2510
01:43:22,171 --> 01:43:27,171
five minute rounds,
Nevada state athletic commission to 

2511
01:43:27,171 --> 01:43:27,171
presides over it.

2512
01:43:27,171 --> 01:43:27,171
No,
no,

2513
01:43:27,171 --> 01:43:27,171
no,
no,

2514
01:43:27,171 --> 01:43:27,171
no,
no,

2515
01:43:27,171 --> 01:43:27,171
no.
In Brazil,

2516
01:43:27,171 --> 01:43:28,350
in the jungle.
Okay.

2517
01:43:28,351 --> 01:43:33,351
You know what I'm talking about.
He's frightened that no one in the 

2518
01:43:33,351 --> 01:43:33,351
audience has shoes on.
Okay.

2519
01:43:33,351 --> 01:43:35,340
Either fucking screaming and yelling.
Those IBC value to those.

2520
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:37,080
Those were savage fights,
man.

2521
01:43:37,081 --> 01:43:40,050
There was always like browse would break
out.

2522
01:43:40,051 --> 01:43:42,120
Henzel Gracie got stabbed in one of 
those.

2523
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:45,120
Okay.
He's frightened that would tatio I think

2524
01:43:45,121 --> 01:43:50,121
that's the guy's named Eugenio tatio 
who's an old school Luta leave ray guy.

2525
01:43:50,791 --> 01:43:52,280
And so of course,
you know,

2526
01:43:52,281 --> 01:43:53,560
old school,
Brazilian Jujitsu,

2527
01:43:53,630 --> 01:43:56,060
Gracie family guy,
and they're fucking battling out and the

2528
01:43:56,061 --> 01:43:57,140
lights go out.
Okay.

2529
01:43:57,141 --> 01:43:59,240
Somebody kills the fucking power,
you know?

2530
01:43:59,241 --> 01:44:00,650
And there's a lot of speculation.
Who did it?

2531
01:44:00,651 --> 01:44:02,300
Maybe they thought that someone was 
getting their ass kicked.

2532
01:44:02,301 --> 01:44:04,330
Who knows?
There's a fucking crazy mats.

2533
01:44:04,331 --> 01:44:05,900
Couple goes on.
Henzle gets stabbed.

2534
01:44:05,901 --> 01:44:10,901
Okay.
Fucking people are stabbing people in 

2535
01:44:10,901 --> 01:44:10,901
the audience.

2536
01:44:10,901 --> 01:44:13,840
I mean,
these are the kinds of fights that that 

2537
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:13,840
chocolate Dell went through.
I mean,

2538
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:14,540
he did it all.
He fought in the early days.

2539
01:44:14,541 --> 01:44:19,541
He,
he found the first time in the UFC was 

2540
01:44:19,541 --> 01:44:19,541
wearing shoes.
He was wearing wrestling shoes,

2541
01:44:19,541 --> 01:44:19,541
kicking dudes.
You know,

2542
01:44:19,541 --> 01:44:20,960
there was very few rules,
you know,

2543
01:44:20,961 --> 01:44:24,530
things were totally different back then 
and that has been through so much.

2544
01:44:24,620 --> 01:44:26,540
He's been through it all,
you know,

2545
01:44:26,630 --> 01:44:28,730
it's just the last few guys that he 
fought,

2546
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:30,350
he's a step below,
you know,

2547
01:44:30,650 --> 01:44:32,360
always a step behind where he used to 
be.

2548
01:44:32,450 --> 01:44:34,310
If he was fighting lower level 
competition,

2549
01:44:34,311 --> 01:44:37,070
like say if they put chuck against,
say some of the guys that fight at two,

2550
01:44:37,071 --> 01:44:42,071
oh five.
When the ultimate fighter or some guys 

2551
01:44:42,071 --> 01:44:42,071
that are like lower level guys don't 
have the kind of standup up the ass,

2552
01:44:42,071 --> 01:44:44,200
he'll be fucking a lot of dudes up.
Do you think though that brain,

2553
01:44:44,290 --> 01:44:47,060
his brain just wants to go to sleep 
though I it knows that like,

2554
01:44:47,061 --> 01:44:49,040
hey,
I know when a knockout is now I,

2555
01:44:49,070 --> 01:44:51,260
you know,
I mean he's lost his chin.

2556
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:54,260
That is what everybody says and that is 
what happens with fighters.

2557
01:44:55,310 --> 01:45:00,310
That is what happened with that.
There's no getting away from that at a 

2558
01:45:00,310 --> 01:45:00,310
certain point in time made it happens.
Joe.

2559
01:45:00,310 --> 01:45:03,860
He knows that it happens with football 
players once they got hooked on it.

2560
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:05,930
Yeah.
When,

2561
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:11,320
when guys start getting knocked out,
it's just when you've taken a certain 

2562
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:12,890
amount of concussions,
sidewalk bathrooms,

2563
01:45:13,950 --> 01:45:18,950
you got hit on the side and he went out 
and we'll talk afterwards because 

2564
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:18,950
nobody's,
you're not miked up.

2565
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:20,880
But um,
you know what?

2566
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:22,610
He's a,
he's a legend.

2567
01:45:22,940 --> 01:45:27,940
He's a guy who's had a gigantic career 
and he was one of these when he was in 

2568
01:45:27,940 --> 01:45:28,460
his prime.
He's one of the scariest guys.

2569
01:45:28,461 --> 01:45:30,080
Every one of the most exciting fighters 
ever.

2570
01:45:30,081 --> 01:45:35,081
When you went to see a chocolate Delphi,
you knew that someone was going to get 

2571
01:45:35,081 --> 01:45:35,081
their fucking ass kicked,
you know,

2572
01:45:35,081 --> 01:45:35,510
and it was going to be brutal.

2573
01:45:35,630 --> 01:45:36,920
You know,
he was going to smash somebody,

2574
01:45:36,921 --> 01:45:39,140
he was going to get a hold of you.
He's going to kick you and punch you and

2575
01:45:39,141 --> 01:45:44,141
smash you.
Remember the first time he knocked out 

2576
01:45:44,141 --> 01:45:44,141
randy couture,
it was like,

2577
01:45:44,141 --> 01:45:44,690
oh shit.
He can knock out randy.

2578
01:45:45,170 --> 01:45:47,210
Randy had been in there with Pedro 
Huizar.

2579
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:49,190
Randy had been in there with Maury 
Smith.

2580
01:45:49,220 --> 01:45:51,830
Randy had been in there with big,
strong knockout,

2581
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:55,160
high level kickboxer heavyweights and 
they had knocked him out,

2582
01:45:55,550 --> 01:45:59,510
but to get in there with chuck and Chuck
blast to orbit with one punch.

2583
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:02,000
So like the way he could knock dudes out
there was.

2584
01:46:02,001 --> 01:46:07,001
There was very,
very few human beings that could stand 

2585
01:46:07,001 --> 01:46:07,001
in front of the guy,
that guy when he blasts,

2586
01:46:07,001 --> 01:46:10,370
but like a lot of guys who have a very 
particular style.

2587
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:12,290
Once you know,
once,

2588
01:46:12,830 --> 01:46:14,660
once your reflux it start to go a little
bit.

2589
01:46:14,810 --> 01:46:18,680
Once you've taken too much punishment,
you don't have other ways to win.

2590
01:46:18,770 --> 01:46:22,250
The more ways you have the wind,
the more unpredictable you are,

2591
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:24,740
the more successful you're going to be.
So I got to like GSP,

2592
01:46:24,741 --> 01:46:27,500
he doesn't even hardly get hurt.
Mean got hurt by Matt Serra,

2593
01:46:27,501 --> 01:46:29,720
but he got clipped and he says he didn't
take Sarah.

2594
01:46:29,930 --> 01:46:32,120
He took Sarah a little bit lightly.
But if you,

2595
01:46:32,150 --> 01:46:34,940
if you're the type of guy that nobody 
knows what the fuck are you going to do,

2596
01:46:34,941 --> 01:46:39,941
where they're going to shoot and go for 
a take down or are going to in the bang 

2597
01:46:39,941 --> 01:46:42,881
if you're cautious,
but you know when to attack and went to 

2598
01:46:42,881 --> 01:46:45,011
move,
you've got to be like always one step 

2599
01:46:45,011 --> 01:46:47,381
ahead.
It can't just be just run in there and 

2600
01:46:47,381 --> 01:46:47,381
brawl and,
and chuck was so fucking good at running

2601
01:46:47,381 --> 01:46:49,170
there and brawl and he had such a good 
chin.

2602
01:46:49,180 --> 01:46:53,880
It was such a good counter puncher.
Know he based his whole style on that.

2603
01:46:53,881 --> 01:46:58,881
And because of that he was the most one 
of the most successful guys and one of 

2604
01:46:58,881 --> 01:46:59,160
the most exciting guys.
But you know,

2605
01:46:59,370 --> 01:47:02,150
that's not the style that allows you to 
keep going deep into your forties.

2606
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:07,200
Like Randy coture.
He's got a safer style like you stands 

2607
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:10,611
with guides,
but he just wants to get a hold of your 

2608
01:47:10,611 --> 01:47:10,611
ass and went to get a hold of your ass.
Pressing up against the cage,

2609
01:47:10,611 --> 01:47:12,030
beat the fuck out.
You kick your knees,

2610
01:47:12,270 --> 01:47:17,270
no,
kick your legs rather knee you in the 

2611
01:47:17,270 --> 01:47:17,270
legs,
elbow you punch,

2612
01:47:17,270 --> 01:47:20,421
you get that dirty box and going and 
then hopefully get your ass on the 

2613
01:47:20,421 --> 01:47:23,421
ground,
beat the shit out of you down there and 

2614
01:47:23,421 --> 01:47:23,421
then choke you.
You know what I mean?

2615
01:47:23,421 --> 01:47:23,421
That's how randy's rocking it these 
days,

2616
01:47:23,421 --> 01:47:24,210
especially in the coalmine fight.

2617
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:26,640
Oh,
that's in the coalmine fight.

2618
01:47:26,641 --> 01:47:27,870
You get to see him,
um,

2619
01:47:28,110 --> 01:47:29,100
you know,
in the coalmine fight,

2620
01:47:29,101 --> 01:47:30,510
like he had a totally different 
strategy.

2621
01:47:30,780 --> 01:47:33,390
Beat Coleman standing up and then took 
home and down choked him.

2622
01:47:33,391 --> 01:47:33,720
You know,
he's,

2623
01:47:33,721 --> 01:47:36,210
he's diversifying,
adding more shit to his game.

2624
01:47:36,570 --> 01:47:39,870
I think of chuck had done that and it's 
fight who had been a lot better off,

2625
01:47:39,871 --> 01:47:42,390
but I think he hits so fucking hard and 
he's,

2626
01:47:42,410 --> 01:47:47,410
you know,
he's so used to blast and guys and 

2627
01:47:47,410 --> 01:47:47,410
there's so much success that it just 
feels good to them.

2628
01:47:47,410 --> 01:47:51,531
And once it starts going,
he just chases these motherfucker down 

2629
01:47:51,531 --> 01:47:51,531
chase's,
these motherfuckers down.

2630
01:47:51,531 --> 01:47:55,080
He wants a blast them.
But Franklin condom with that really 

2631
01:47:55,080 --> 01:47:58,101
well timed right hand a current 
overcommitting so chuck was moving 

2632
01:47:58,101 --> 01:47:59,190
forward and he just catches him with 
that counter.

2633
01:47:59,310 --> 01:48:02,070
So even though it didn't look like the 
hardest punch in the world,

2634
01:48:02,650 --> 01:48:07,650
rich has a hard puncher and chuck was 
moving forward and so it was a hard 

2635
01:48:07,650 --> 01:48:07,650
shot.
Man.

2636
01:48:07,650 --> 01:48:09,270
It busted open his lip.
Do you see what his lip looked like?

2637
01:48:09,930 --> 01:48:10,860
It looked bad.
A big,

2638
01:48:10,890 --> 01:48:12,120
big cut.
So it wasn't like.

2639
01:48:12,121 --> 01:48:14,120
It wasn't like,
you know,

2640
01:48:14,190 --> 01:48:16,890
a shot that shouldn't have dropped him,
that Shaka dropped anybody.

2641
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:18,180
It was a hard shot.

2642
01:48:18,750 --> 01:48:23,750
Sick two years ago we'll have dropped.
I think it would have rattled him a 

2643
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:24,030
little more maybe.
I think he's gotten this in his head and

2644
01:48:24,031 --> 01:48:24,830
says,
you know what?

2645
01:48:24,831 --> 01:48:28,260
I had to sleep apnea first.
When you first have an extreme,

2646
01:48:28,470 --> 01:48:29,670
you wake up like this,
Joe.

2647
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:33,790
So what happens is every time you lose 
your breath,

2648
01:48:33,791 --> 01:48:38,791
when I was 400 pounds,
every time I chase you or walk and I 

2649
01:48:38,791 --> 01:48:39,690
lose my breath,
my body was going through anxiety.

2650
01:48:40,290 --> 01:48:41,760
That's how.
That's why I had to go to the ICU.

2651
01:48:41,770 --> 01:48:46,770
So your body would start thinking about 
the trauma that you've had in the past 

2652
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:46,770
and when you,
when you have sleep apnea,

2653
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:51,741
you wake up choking,
you wake up on your feet going like 

2654
01:48:51,741 --> 01:48:52,530
this,
no grasping for air.

2655
01:48:52,830 --> 01:48:55,710
So every time I ran on the air for a 
long time,

2656
01:48:56,100 --> 01:48:57,960
even on planes,
there was just a connection,

2657
01:48:58,050 --> 01:48:59,610
just the connection and yet,
okay.

2658
01:48:59,610 --> 01:49:01,620
So there's that.
And then on top of it,

2659
01:49:01,621 --> 01:49:04,920
just the raw data that we know about 
people that take concussions,

2660
01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:06,690
you know,
you cannot take too many concussions.

2661
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:07,890
Oh,
you don't want to.

2662
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Yeah.
You don't want to know that putting the 

2663
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:13,000
finger.
Like I told Eddie,

2664
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Eddie goes,
well,

2665
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:17,000
soccer.
Robert came back and he just started 

2666
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,861
covering him.
Stuff like all the way chuck is right 

2667
01:49:18,861 --> 01:49:20,541
now.
Somebody will just hit his hand and he 

2668
01:49:20,541 --> 01:49:20,541
could hit themselves,
knock himself out.

2669
01:49:20,541 --> 01:49:22,280
That's how sensitive that switching.
And it's a shame.

2670
01:49:22,281 --> 01:49:24,610
I'm as big as four.
He took a couple of shots before that.

2671
01:49:25,850 --> 01:49:29,130
Before that Bro,
he took one to the head.

2672
01:49:29,131 --> 01:49:32,250
He took one to go back to watch the 
fight again.

2673
01:49:32,251 --> 01:49:33,900
But I remember him getting clipped a 
couple of times.

2674
01:49:33,901 --> 01:49:35,040
Yeah,
he got clipped a couple times.

2675
01:49:35,041 --> 01:49:36,840
I heard it.
The whole place smelled like weed.

2676
01:49:36,850 --> 01:49:37,980
Was that true?
Oh my God,

2677
01:49:37,981 --> 01:49:39,120
Dude.
When I went to the bathroom,

2678
01:49:39,121 --> 01:49:41,100
I went to go take a leak and that's how 
I was running back to the bathroom.

2679
01:49:41,101 --> 01:49:44,250
It just stunk of weed in this one area 
and it's the same area.

2680
01:49:44,251 --> 01:49:45,250
We're dudes.
We're stealing dudes.

2681
01:49:45,270 --> 01:49:48,790
Hats.
Two guys were baked.

2682
01:49:48,791 --> 01:49:53,791
It's fucked.
They snatching hats off people's heads 

2683
01:49:53,791 --> 01:49:56,880
as they would walk,
walk through the tunnel on the way to 

2684
01:49:56,880 --> 01:49:58,951
the arena sign.
They got their hat on their focus and 

2685
01:49:58,951 --> 01:50:00,970
just snatch and dude's hats off.
And there's all these animated gif files

2686
01:50:00,971 --> 01:50:03,490
online.
Other guy's hilarious.

2687
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:06,640
Is the same guy and they got these big 
stupid shit eating grin on their face.

2688
01:50:06,641 --> 01:50:09,910
Like that's awesome.
And the funniest one is when he tries to

2689
01:50:09,911 --> 01:50:12,960
get Martin Kampmann his hat and he just 
misses.

2690
01:50:13,530 --> 01:50:18,530
Just misses.
I got walks by and you see the guy who 

2691
01:50:18,530 --> 01:50:19,030
like to retweet that later.
Oh yeah,

2692
01:50:19,031 --> 01:50:20,270
I will.
I'll find the link.

2693
01:50:22,830 --> 01:50:27,830
Was the seller Sarah Pailin.
He's losing his mind just like Sarah 

2694
01:50:27,830 --> 01:50:30,550
Pailin to set aside from,
you know,

2695
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:33,800
chill son and uh,
he stolen Aziz Ansari joke.

2696
01:50:34,140 --> 01:50:35,830
It was like doing one of his,
uh,

2697
01:50:35,850 --> 01:50:39,700
his speeches about Anderson Silva and 
his manager and he did a disease joke.

2698
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:44,820
That's awesome.
He called the little ghetto brothers 

2699
01:50:44,820 --> 01:50:44,820
busted on that.
You can't do that.

2700
01:50:44,820 --> 01:50:47,470
One is a punching bag and the other one 
I'm not worried about.

2701
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:50,650
Wow.
He said that they'll get was black belt.

2702
01:50:50,710 --> 01:50:52,760
You get a Mcdonald's and a gift set or 
whatever.

2703
01:50:52,761 --> 01:50:56,550
The happier.
He's the best shit talker by far.

2704
01:50:56,860 --> 01:50:58,420
A fucking nice guy too,
man.

2705
01:50:58,660 --> 01:51:00,280
When you talked to Chael Sonnen like 
outside,

2706
01:51:00,281 --> 01:51:02,050
he's a fucking funny,
nice guy.

2707
01:51:02,350 --> 01:51:07,350
He's just real good at talking shit.
He's a politician and he can fucking 

2708
01:51:07,350 --> 01:51:07,350
fight dude,
bro.

2709
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,870
Me and all this emotions that he's 
charging up and this is all like,

2710
01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:14,500
look,
you think about what Damien Maia got mad

2711
01:51:14,501 --> 01:51:16,550
or got Anderson,
Matt Damon My.

2712
01:51:16,550 --> 01:51:17,650
This is what he said.
He said,

2713
01:51:17,651 --> 01:51:20,020
I respect Anderson as a fighter.
I don't respect them as a person.

2714
01:51:20,170 --> 01:51:21,880
Whatever the fuck that means to 
Anderson.

2715
01:51:21,881 --> 01:51:22,720
Why?
I don't know.

2716
01:51:22,721 --> 01:51:27,721
But that made him crazy,
he got so angry and so we never seen 

2717
01:51:27,721 --> 01:51:29,080
Anderson standing in front of a guy 
yelling and screaming,

2718
01:51:29,110 --> 01:51:32,020
screaming at him,
calling him rich boy and you know,

2719
01:51:32,021 --> 01:51:37,021
show me your Jujitsu and swearing at him
saying all these different squares and 

2720
01:51:37,021 --> 01:51:37,021
then just beating his ass and mocking 
them.

2721
01:51:37,021 --> 01:51:39,640
Never seen to Anderson do that before to
anybody.

2722
01:51:39,850 --> 01:51:44,850
And Demian Maia is generally known as a 
really nice guy and respectful guy in a 

2723
01:51:44,850 --> 01:51:45,070
martial artist.
But that one statement,

2724
01:51:45,071 --> 01:51:47,470
whatever the fuck it meant,
threw him into a tizzy.

2725
01:51:47,620 --> 01:51:50,560
What is gonna happen when he gets in the
cage with channel Sunnen?

2726
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:55,920
Charles Center has talked so much shit 
about them making sacrifices to pick me 

2727
01:51:56,171 --> 01:51:58,700
God's and fucking all kinds of knots.

2728
01:51:58,700 --> 01:51:59,620
He's going,
fuck.

2729
01:51:59,621 --> 01:52:02,820
It doesn't stop.
He doesn't stop.

2730
01:52:02,830 --> 01:52:06,550
He goes to Pailin certain Doug,
his twitter is just rampant with it,

2731
01:52:06,810 --> 01:52:09,100
whose twitter is all like him talking 
shit.

2732
01:52:10,060 --> 01:52:13,250
But I have not even seen this.
Thank you for opening up my house.

2733
01:52:13,330 --> 01:52:16,390
He does these questions and answers.
I missed the one he did in Vancouver.

2734
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:18,040
I,
I missed the other one before that,

2735
01:52:18,041 --> 01:52:23,041
but everybody was talking about that.
It said it was the funniest fucking q 

2736
01:52:23,041 --> 01:52:23,041
and a by far.
My facebook.

2737
01:52:23,041 --> 01:52:27,721
Somebody say yes.
Peter Fogle the Guy Willie bar setup 

2738
01:52:27,721 --> 01:52:27,721
broke his nose,
emailed it to me.

2739
01:52:27,721 --> 01:52:28,210
Well,
he just did another one.

2740
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:29,470
It just did another one.
Okay.

2741
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:34,560
This is the second q and a.
Then two of them so far pumping up the 

2742
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:34,560
Anderson fight.
Dude,

2743
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:39,091
he's fucking hilarious,
but he fucked up when he's told that as 

2744
01:52:39,091 --> 01:52:41,551
he's Antasari joke,
they're not going to do the Internet is 

2745
01:52:41,551 --> 01:52:43,351
not going to let them ride that out.
Have you been to a website called a 

2746
01:52:43,351 --> 01:52:43,690
Wolfram?
Wolfram Alpha.

2747
01:52:44,930 --> 01:52:46,190
This Wolfram Alpha

2748
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:51,220
for people who aren't aware of it is 
just project where they're trying to 

2749
01:52:51,220 --> 01:52:53,651
take the next step after Google and it's
trying to be a website literally that 

2750
01:52:53,651 --> 01:52:54,320
you ask it a question.
It gives you an answer.

2751
01:52:54,350 --> 01:52:59,350
Right.
It's so cool because like I put in my 

2752
01:52:59,350 --> 01:53:01,841
birthday in the weather and I got the 
exact temperature when I was born to the

2753
01:53:02,091 --> 01:53:04,100
exact hour.
I got the lows,

2754
01:53:04,101 --> 01:53:09,101
the highs during the day.
That cloud cover the population of 

2755
01:53:09,101 --> 01:53:09,101
Columbus at that time,
the humidity,

2756
01:53:09,101 --> 01:53:13,961
the pressure,
the wind's blowing so much shit that if 

2757
01:53:13,961 --> 01:53:17,081
I was with doc from back to the future,
I could totally get to the right second 

2758
01:53:17,081 --> 01:53:17,990
of the day that I needed to go back in 
time with,

2759
01:53:17,991 --> 01:53:22,991
you know,
if this will give you the information 

2760
01:53:22,991 --> 01:53:22,991
for that.
You know,

2761
01:53:22,991 --> 01:53:25,661
it's really funny that you just brought 
that up and then you're talking about 

2762
01:53:25,661 --> 01:53:28,181
this because there was a subject that 
was on the message board the other day 

2763
01:53:28,181 --> 01:53:28,181
that I thought was really interesting.

2764
01:53:28,181 --> 01:53:31,450
There's this new scientific discovery 
that they found where they do believe 

2765
01:53:31,450 --> 01:53:35,561
that it's possible that the universe 
might be far older than 14 billion 

2766
01:53:35,561 --> 01:53:35,600
years.
That's what they think it is.

2767
01:53:35,601 --> 01:53:40,601
Now.
They think it's like 150 billion and 

2768
01:53:40,601 --> 01:53:41,570
it's just this small group of scientists
and astronomers,

2769
01:53:41,590 --> 01:53:44,990
the that have this possibility in their 
head and you know,

2770
01:53:44,991 --> 01:53:49,991
it hasn't been sold yet entirely,
but when you start thinking about stuff 

2771
01:53:49,991 --> 01:53:49,991
like that,
people.

2772
01:53:49,991 --> 01:53:53,390
There was like an argument on the board 
and the argument was there's some things

2773
01:53:53,391 --> 01:53:55,400
about the universe.
You're never going to be able to know.

2774
01:53:55,430 --> 01:54:00,430
It's pointless to even try it.
Never got to know when the universe 

2775
01:54:00,430 --> 01:54:00,530
began.
How the fuck do they know that?

2776
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:02,120
How do you know that you're not going to
ever be able to know?

2777
01:54:02,390 --> 01:54:07,390
We are.
If our understanding is constantly 

2778
01:54:07,390 --> 01:54:07,390
increasing.
Okay.

2779
01:54:07,390 --> 01:54:10,260
What we know today is so much more 
advanced than what we knew just 100 

2780
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:11,450
years ago or 200 years ago or 300 years 
ago,

2781
01:54:11,740 --> 01:54:16,740
you know,
a couple hundred years ago to get 

2782
01:54:16,740 --> 01:54:16,740
around.

2783
01:54:16,740 --> 01:54:16,740
You have to be on a fucking animal.
Okay.

2784
01:54:16,740 --> 01:54:17,390
You wanted an image of someone.
You had to draw it,

2785
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:18,410
right.
There was no cameras.

2786
01:54:18,411 --> 01:54:19,250
Right?
Think about that.

2787
01:54:19,310 --> 01:54:24,310
All right.
That's just a couple of hundred years 

2788
01:54:24,310 --> 01:54:26,020
ago.
We don't know what the fuck kind of 

2789
01:54:26,020 --> 01:54:27,311
innovations going to come up a couple of
100 years from now or a couple thousand 

2790
01:54:27,311 --> 01:54:30,611
years from now.
It might very well be possible that not 

2791
01:54:30,611 --> 01:54:32,600
only can we decipher exactly how the 
universe began,

2792
01:54:32,750 --> 01:54:37,750
but we can probably.
We're probably going to be able to get 

2793
01:54:37,750 --> 01:54:40,571
an accurate map of the history of the 
planet from the very beginning to now 

2794
01:54:40,571 --> 01:54:43,370
much more detailed,
much more precise than we have today.

2795
01:54:43,550 --> 01:54:48,550
We're probably going to be able to 
recreate or capture every single moment 

2796
01:54:48,550 --> 01:54:51,350
of every single day of every single hour
that that's ever existed.

2797
01:54:51,530 --> 01:54:54,770
That's it's all very possible.
They're going to get crazier and crazier

2798
01:54:54,771 --> 01:54:55,340
with time.

2799
01:54:55,520 --> 01:55:00,110
They're going to get crazier and crazier
with breaking down the quantum mechanics

2800
01:55:00,111 --> 01:55:01,040
of the universe.
You know,

2801
01:55:01,041 --> 01:55:05,330
when you start getting into like the 
crazy subatomic particles that disappear

2802
01:55:05,331 --> 01:55:10,331
and reappear and exist in two different 
places at the same time or in a 

2803
01:55:10,331 --> 01:55:10,970
superposition and these things that they
don't understand well.

2804
01:55:10,971 --> 01:55:15,971
As we get more and more understanding 
and know more and more about the 

2805
01:55:15,971 --> 01:55:16,820
weirdness of the world,
we're going to be able to figure out how

2806
01:55:16,821 --> 01:55:18,590
to fucking decipher it.
You know,

2807
01:55:18,591 --> 01:55:20,100
and it might be that like,
you know,

2808
01:55:20,110 --> 01:55:25,110
like a time machine when the,
when they invent a time machine or 

2809
01:55:25,110 --> 01:55:27,431
something like that or,
or whatever the fuck you want to call 

2810
01:55:27,431 --> 01:55:27,431
this next stage of understanding of 
matter.

2811
01:55:27,431 --> 01:55:32,110
When they invented the idea of a time 
machine is the only way you're gonna be 

2812
01:55:32,110 --> 01:55:35,321
able to travel back in time.
It's once the first time machines 

2813
01:55:35,321 --> 01:55:37,640
invented,
so they're going to invent a time 

2814
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:39,551
machine and you can't go before that,
but what you can do is anything from 

2815
01:55:39,551 --> 01:55:43,031
that,
we'll be able to come back to that 

2816
01:55:43,031 --> 01:55:43,031
point,
so everything that exists from now until

2817
01:55:43,031 --> 01:55:45,210
whenever you can access it,
as soon as they invent a time machine,

2818
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:46,920
why not?

2819
01:55:47,430 --> 01:55:49,980
Why fucking not shit's going to get 
crazy.

2820
01:55:50,070 --> 01:55:52,290
If you can do this,
nobody would have ever thought you could

2821
01:55:52,291 --> 01:55:57,291
be able to do this.
If you talked to someone in 

2822
01:55:57,291 --> 01:55:58,671
Shakespeare's day and say,
do you think there's ever going to be 

2823
01:55:58,671 --> 01:56:00,420
able to time where I've take something 
out of my pocket and through the air,

2824
01:56:00,421 --> 01:56:03,450
I ask it a question like,
you could mean Wolfram Alpha.

2825
01:56:03,451 --> 01:56:04,980
You can't do that.
We can do that with Google.

2826
01:56:05,100 --> 01:56:10,100
You can google voice it.
You know what year did the Sistine 

2827
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:10,100
Chapel get built?
Bam.

2828
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:14,990
They tell you instantly and if you get.
If it gets to a point and it's gone to 

2829
01:56:14,990 --> 01:56:15,480
if they've got the google,
if it gets all Wolfram Alpha point,

2830
01:56:15,660 --> 01:56:17,160
we can have.
You can ask it a question,

2831
01:56:17,161 --> 01:56:22,161
you can give any answer or it can give 
you any answer on any question of 

2832
01:56:22,161 --> 01:56:25,790
anything that's ever happened ever that 
human beings are aware of and you'll 

2833
01:56:25,790 --> 01:56:28,611
have all the information right there 
were you told that to people that lived 

2834
01:56:28,611 --> 01:56:28,611
in Shakespeare's Day.

2835
01:56:28,611 --> 01:56:28,611
They were told you about her fucking 
mind.

2836
01:56:28,830 --> 01:56:32,970
It's going to get crazier than this.
It has to because everything gets crazy.

2837
01:56:34,710 --> 01:56:39,710
What the fuck is next?
Sometimes I just drive in my car and I 

2838
01:56:39,710 --> 01:56:40,620
sit in traffic and I go,
what the fuck is next?

2839
01:56:40,830 --> 01:56:44,040
Is there going to be some crazy new 
thing that's going to change everything?

2840
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:49,280
Like is it,
are we in a race between human beings 

2841
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:52,730
figuring out what the next thing is?
The next crazy innovation is or us just 

2842
01:56:52,730 --> 01:56:57,411
completely fucking everything up with 
polluting the fucking ocean and you 

2843
01:56:57,411 --> 01:56:59,400
know,
nuclear explosions and wars and all that

2844
01:56:59,401 --> 01:57:04,401
other crazy shit.
Like are we in a race between like 

2845
01:57:04,401 --> 01:57:05,250
Schumann retarded chimpanzee instincts 
and technology?

2846
01:57:05,970 --> 01:57:10,970
You ever thought about it like that?
Like when we talk about like the peak 

2847
01:57:10,970 --> 01:57:12,240
oil documentary that we watched,
we thought it was bullshit,

2848
01:57:12,660 --> 01:57:15,210
but the idea of peak oil is a terrifying
idea.

2849
01:57:15,210 --> 01:57:20,210
If it was true and if there was a finite
amount of oil and they do bust into it 

2850
01:57:20,210 --> 01:57:20,210
and then we have,
we're fucked,

2851
01:57:20,230 --> 01:57:25,230
we have no oil.
Things could get really crazy like that 

2852
01:57:25,230 --> 01:57:25,710
is really possible.
Are they going to come up with something

2853
01:57:25,711 --> 01:57:30,711
that's going to replace that and make 
everything better and make everything 

2854
01:57:30,711 --> 01:57:30,711
even more advanced and more simple and 
more,

2855
01:57:30,711 --> 01:57:32,940
you know,
more natural to the,

2856
01:57:32,970 --> 01:57:37,970
to the environment.
Are they going to figure that out first 

2857
01:57:37,970 --> 01:57:38,190
or are we going to run out of supplies 
and resources first?

2858
01:57:38,340 --> 01:57:43,340
Like is that a battle is a battle 
between the human retarded monkey 

2859
01:57:43,340 --> 01:57:43,340
chimpanzee behavior of take,
take,

2860
01:57:43,340 --> 01:57:48,231
take.
Don't think about the future and 

2861
01:57:48,231 --> 01:57:48,231
technology and innovation and the 
ability to harness matter.

2862
01:57:48,231 --> 01:57:50,720
I think whatever happens is not going to
happen during our lifetimes.

2863
01:57:50,740 --> 01:57:51,530
I don't think so.
No.

2864
01:57:52,050 --> 01:57:55,070
I think something crazy,
a lifetime.

2865
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:57,060
Twenty years ago when you were finger 
banging,

2866
01:57:57,061 --> 01:57:59,250
that chick behind boulder,
Boston high school,

2867
01:57:59,810 --> 01:58:04,810
that was going to be a milkshake thing 
with the same shit that is every year 

2868
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:10,410
something new technology.
Every year,

2869
01:58:10,860 --> 01:58:15,860
every year there's going to be after we 
think the reaction to all this oil in 

2870
01:58:15,860 --> 01:58:16,860
the ocean.
It's got to be a rehab.

2871
01:58:16,861 --> 01:58:18,270
It's going to be.
There's going to be innovation.

2872
01:58:18,271 --> 01:58:19,230
Some.
It's a horrible,

2873
01:58:19,231 --> 01:58:22,260
horrible disaster.
Some west coast,

2874
01:58:23,130 --> 01:58:28,130
you know what I mean?
Hopefully like what have jersey shore 

2875
01:58:28,130 --> 01:58:30,201
and the whole east coast beach gets 
destroyed and all those people for 

2876
01:58:30,201 --> 01:58:33,891
summer vacations.
When it come to the west coast this 

2877
01:58:33,891 --> 01:58:35,250
summer it might be.
It's too much of a drug to go from.

2878
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:41,500
Problem with that show is there's so 
many people like that and now think they

2879
01:58:41,501 --> 01:58:42,100
can be famous

2880
01:58:42,230 --> 01:58:45,380
too.
They can get on a fucking jersey shore,

2881
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:47,230
bro.
I'm fucking auditioning for that.

2882
01:58:47,231 --> 01:58:49,450
I'm fake Tan and Everyday Glendale 
lately.

2883
01:58:49,540 --> 01:58:52,660
No.
Glendale is off the hook now version.

2884
01:58:52,710 --> 01:58:53,090
Yeah,
the PR.

2885
01:58:53,190 --> 01:58:57,700
They use that to Psycho Mike from K rock
in La.

2886
01:58:57,701 --> 01:58:59,830
That the thing that he did the video 
about,

2887
01:58:59,831 --> 01:59:01,150
uh,
about Glendale.

2888
01:59:01,210 --> 01:59:02,050
No,
dude,

2889
01:59:02,051 --> 01:59:05,140
it's hilarious.
It's all Armenians in Glendale.

2890
01:59:05,470 --> 01:59:07,510
I forget the fucking bit.
It's a really,

2891
01:59:07,511 --> 01:59:08,830
really funny song.
Did.

2892
01:59:08,850 --> 01:59:11,030
It's ridiculous.
This one place I go to Brooklyn,

2893
01:59:11,300 --> 01:59:14,530
it's one place to go to called a Sushi 
joint.

2894
01:59:14,710 --> 01:59:17,230
It's like this change,
this strip mall.

2895
01:59:17,260 --> 01:59:21,760
It has like Ernesto outdoor stores and 
there's a Sushi place,

2896
01:59:21,850 --> 01:59:25,720
but all the stores are like fashion 
outlet and then like the windows are all

2897
01:59:25,721 --> 01:59:30,721
black and stuff like that.
And then the next thing is like 

2898
01:59:30,721 --> 01:59:32,880
something else.
But what's weird is if you go by there 

2899
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:33,100
at like two in the morning,
none of those places are open.

2900
01:59:33,100 --> 01:59:36,580
But yet every single car there's like 
100 cars in the parking lot.

2901
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:38,830
It's like,
what the fuck is going on?

2902
01:59:38,860 --> 01:59:41,080
That's how Glendale is.
Everywhere you drive,

2903
01:59:41,081 --> 01:59:43,480
you see these fake rug stores and shit.
You know,

2904
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:48,310
it's partly luck and armo party,
like an original song apparently.

2905
01:59:48,580 --> 01:59:52,180
I'm going to watch that later.
Uh,

2906
01:59:52,210 --> 01:59:54,010
yeah.
Somebody sent a,

2907
01:59:54,060 --> 01:59:56,350
I think the video.
I think Opie,

2908
01:59:56,580 --> 02:00:00,370
opie and anthony twitter the other day,
a nature's little flashlight.

2909
02:00:00,371 --> 02:00:03,790
And it was at monkey using a frog to 
whack off like a fleshlight.

2910
02:00:03,910 --> 02:00:05,050
Yeah,
that's old school video.

2911
02:00:05,990 --> 02:00:08,380
Funny Video.
That monkey fucks that frog's mouth.

2912
02:00:09,310 --> 02:00:11,650
That's the monkeys are down for their 
down for rape and shit.

2913
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:17,080
You know,
we think about those champions to like 

2914
02:00:17,080 --> 02:00:17,080
Bj and the bear.
We think they're all cute and shit.

2915
02:00:17,080 --> 02:00:18,040
Then you find out about like their chimp
at eight.

2916
02:00:18,041 --> 02:00:20,770
That lady's face.
And another chimp that fuck that dude up

2917
02:00:20,771 --> 02:00:22,810
and rip his balls off and ripped his 
feet off.

2918
02:00:23,020 --> 02:00:24,250
Chimps eat babies.
Man.

2919
02:00:24,251 --> 02:00:27,580
There's been recorded instances of 
chimps stealing babies and eating them.

2920
02:00:29,220 --> 02:00:31,890
What the Fuck Joe Rogan.
Why bother me with this shit?

2921
02:00:32,450 --> 02:00:34,440
I got to what was sitting there having a
good time.

2922
02:00:34,441 --> 02:00:36,180
Like gentlemen,
you got to talk to me about chimps.

2923
02:00:36,181 --> 02:00:37,620
Eat and babies.
What the fuck?

2924
02:00:37,621 --> 02:00:39,780
Kind of been a table conversation.
Is this cocksucker

2925
02:00:41,340 --> 02:00:44,880
he hit the two hour mark with me.
That's the two hour mark.

2926
02:00:45,010 --> 02:00:45,700
Yep.
Alright,

2927
02:00:45,750 --> 02:00:47,420
well we'll come up with one subject then
we're gonna.

2928
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:48,480
Wrap this up.
Joey,

2929
02:00:48,690 --> 02:00:50,390
that's up to you.
The subject.

2930
02:00:50,830 --> 02:00:55,190
Uh,
you had a job before you fucking Brian.

2931
02:00:55,191 --> 02:00:57,240
You had to go with and stuff.
What was I talking about?

2932
02:00:58,140 --> 02:00:59,060
Senior,
old surf.

2933
02:00:59,130 --> 02:00:59,990
See?
No.

2934
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:05,000
The other one before that.
You see going to bring it up during the 

2935
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:05,000
podcast.
Oh,

2936
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:05,520
uh,
I thought.

2937
02:01:05,550 --> 02:01:09,780
I don't remember.
I can't order an iphone.

2938
02:01:10,150 --> 02:01:11,310
Shit.
Is this,

2939
02:01:11,311 --> 02:01:16,311
you're the fucking captain Kirk or this 
program for a word from our sponsor from

2940
02:01:18,811 --> 02:01:20,910
1:00
AM to 3:00

2941
02:01:20,910 --> 02:01:22,340
AM.
Just trying to access the island.

2942
02:01:22,350 --> 02:01:22,900
No,
I wasn't.

2943
02:01:22,910 --> 02:01:24,960
I knew I wanted to talk about that 
fucking guy.

2944
02:01:24,961 --> 02:01:27,800
That Christian warrior who went looking 
for a lot.

2945
02:01:27,930 --> 02:01:28,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

2946
02:01:28,350 --> 02:01:30,690
That's what I wanted to talk about.
If you don't know this story,

2947
02:01:30,691 --> 02:01:35,691
there's a fucking dude who is this just 
old white guy who's just Christian 

2948
02:01:35,691 --> 02:01:37,590
warrior from America who put a fucking.

2949
02:01:37,590 --> 02:01:42,590
He got a sword.
He took a sword with them and a gun and 

2950
02:01:42,590 --> 02:01:45,950
he went to the fucking mountains of 
Pakistan and he went to the mountains of

2951
02:01:45,951 --> 02:01:48,380
Pakistan to try to find Osama bin Ladin 
to kill him.

2952
02:01:48,381 --> 02:01:49,870
And they caught his ass.
Wow.

2953
02:01:50,170 --> 02:01:52,130
Like,
what are you doing dude?

2954
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:55,250
They put them in jail.
I can't believe they didn't kill him.

2955
02:01:55,280 --> 02:02:00,280
I mean,
this guy was sitting in Kentucky or 

2956
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:00,280
somewhere and they said,
when they fuck it,

2957
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:01,350
I'm sick and tired of waiting for a sign
to live.

2958
02:02:01,380 --> 02:02:03,920
This has been going on for 10 years.
Yeah.

2959
02:02:03,970 --> 02:02:06,800
That's borrowed money from his cousin 
and he said,

2960
02:02:06,801 --> 02:02:08,390
fuck it.
I'll go over there like a boy scout.

2961
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:11,710
He made that grace your bitch.
He ain't first you last a story.

2962
02:02:11,711 --> 02:02:15,350
A 52 year old American citizen who said 
he was searching for Osama bin Laden was

2963
02:02:15,351 --> 02:02:18,950
detained in Pakistan near the border 
with Afghanistan this week.

2964
02:02:19,730 --> 02:02:22,760
His name was Gary Faulkner from 
California was carrying a pistol,

2965
02:02:22,761 --> 02:02:26,720
a sword night vision equipment and 
Christian religious books.

2966
02:02:27,660 --> 02:02:32,660
What that might be,
the last guy in the world you want 

2967
02:02:32,660 --> 02:02:33,740
looking for you.
The last thing,

2968
02:02:33,770 --> 02:02:38,770
the last dude in the world you want is a
52 year old man with a sword and a Bible

2969
02:02:39,650 --> 02:02:42,440
and he's.
He flew to the other side of the fucking

2970
02:02:42,441 --> 02:02:43,490
world,
defined you.

2971
02:02:44,030 --> 02:02:47,480
He's got religious books,
a gun and a Bible and a sore.

2972
02:02:48,530 --> 02:02:50,480
Oh my God.
Do.

2973
02:02:50,510 --> 02:02:52,320
There's guys like doubt out there,
out there,

2974
02:02:52,370 --> 02:02:53,300
out there,
out there,

2975
02:02:53,301 --> 02:02:54,500
out there,
and they're ready to go.

2976
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:56,270
You've got to remember that it's 
sometimes it's,

2977
02:02:56,300 --> 02:03:01,300
you know,
sometimes it's good to go online and 

2978
02:03:01,300 --> 02:03:01,300
watch some fucked up videos just to know
that guy's out there.

2979
02:03:01,300 --> 02:03:03,920
I don't like watching murder videos,
but I watched one recently,

2980
02:03:04,020 --> 02:03:06,260
but the Mexican drug lords killed this 
fucking guy.

2981
02:03:06,410 --> 02:03:08,580
I cut this guy's head off.
They showed a video.

2982
02:03:08,850 --> 02:03:09,760
They put that shit online.

2983
02:03:11,790 --> 02:03:14,710
Watch youtube.
I stopped watching this.

2984
02:03:14,740 --> 02:03:17,080
Who started cutting his throat.
Fuck that shit.

2985
02:03:17,480 --> 02:03:18,800
My am.
I need to watch the whole thing.

2986
02:03:18,801 --> 02:03:23,801
Apparently he cuts his whole head off.
The guy's squealing and making noises 

2987
02:03:23,801 --> 02:03:25,240
and over that crap coming out of his 
whole apparently terrible.

2988
02:03:25,370 --> 02:03:27,800
It takes awhile for them to saw his head
off and that's how they kill them.

2989
02:03:28,130 --> 02:03:29,870
Hard to watch,
man.

2990
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:31,490
Hard to watch.
They tied the stood up,

2991
02:03:31,850 --> 02:03:33,740
you know,
just fucking cut his head off on video.

2992
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:37,320
Next time you see a video like that,
go to kick [inaudible] dot com and white

2993
02:03:37,330 --> 02:03:42,020
stag instead it and refresh your memory 
like gingers cake for this woman.

2994
02:03:42,021 --> 02:03:47,021
That puts a cake down and as he sits on 
it and then she farts into the camera 

2995
02:03:47,021 --> 02:03:47,970
and it's the icing and everything 
bubbles.

2996
02:03:47,990 --> 02:03:52,750
That's such a little fucking Weirdo 
because that.

2997
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:55,970
That'd be like ginger to your fucking 
taste buds.

2998
02:03:55,970 --> 02:04:00,060
After watching a d heading you up and 
tell you about these websites.

2999
02:04:00,740 --> 02:04:02,660
It's all my website,
my message board,

3000
02:04:02,690 --> 02:04:04,610
you know I go to when I go to Joe Rogan 
Dot net,

3001
02:04:04,611 --> 02:04:07,630
that forum,
the forum right now is over $3,

3002
02:04:07,631 --> 02:04:10,440
million posts.
Some guy emailed me that does go to cake

3003
02:04:10,441 --> 02:04:13,460
farts that come and watch that video.
It's just in the main forum.

3004
02:04:13,461 --> 02:04:15,470
There's 2 million,
737,000

3005
02:04:15,471 --> 02:04:18,890
posts now and then you count the retard 
room and all the other shit on there.

3006
02:04:19,130 --> 02:04:21,500
There's more than 3 million posts or 
anything that's fucked up.

3007
02:04:21,530 --> 02:04:24,020
Anything that's crazy.
And the Internet whenever it comes out,

3008
02:04:24,140 --> 02:04:26,810
it's like a portal to all things 
interesting and fucked up.

3009
02:04:27,170 --> 02:04:30,080
So just it's my own website so I can't 
get away from it.

3010
02:04:30,140 --> 02:04:32,150
If there's anything nutty that's out 
there in the world,

3011
02:04:32,151 --> 02:04:33,770
I have the choice whether or not to 
watch it,

3012
02:04:33,771 --> 02:04:38,771
but I don't have the choice whether or 
not to know it exists because someone's 

3013
02:04:38,771 --> 02:04:38,771
going to put it up there,
you know,

3014
02:04:38,771 --> 02:04:39,510
like that human centipede.

3015
02:04:39,570 --> 02:04:44,570
I ducked and dodged that human centipede
video for a long time because I thought 

3016
02:04:44,570 --> 02:04:46,050
that it was like a short clip.
Something fucked up.

3017
02:04:46,051 --> 02:04:50,160
Like somebody who's mutated or someone 
who did something crazy to somebody then

3018
02:04:50,161 --> 02:04:51,780
turns out it's just some Nettie horror 
movie.

3019
02:04:51,870 --> 02:04:53,660
You know the whole story behind the 
human centipede.

3020
02:04:54,140 --> 02:04:56,460
Did you go fucking see splice?
No.

3021
02:04:56,461 --> 02:05:01,461
I downloaded it,
but the people don't even who are 

3022
02:05:01,461 --> 02:05:05,180
pirating it don't like the movie said it
like they don't care about the quality 

3023
02:05:05,180 --> 02:05:07,710
of their torrance right now,
so I have to wait because it's so bad.

3024
02:05:07,711 --> 02:05:08,610
I couldn't even watch it.
I was like,

3025
02:05:08,611 --> 02:05:09,190
I can.
I'm not going.

3026
02:05:09,240 --> 02:05:11,130
I'm not going to pay to see this.
The bad version.

3027
02:05:11,610 --> 02:05:13,240
Horrible version like that.
Halfway through the camera,

3028
02:05:13,250 --> 02:05:13,410
man.

3029
02:05:13,860 --> 02:05:18,860
The sucks.
There's nothing funny.

3030
02:05:20,051 --> 02:05:25,051
The little ones,
will they do it in a movie theater when 

3031
02:05:25,051 --> 02:05:25,051
someone like,
how did he get away with that shit?

3032
02:05:25,051 --> 02:05:26,700
Just put a little fucking tripod on 
that.

3033
02:05:26,710 --> 02:05:30,090
A little thing where those soda sets,
they put a tripod in there,

3034
02:05:30,091 --> 02:05:32,710
Jack that sucker up and keep an eye out 
the door.

3035
02:05:33,050 --> 02:05:34,590
People who've gotten caught,
they got caught.

3036
02:05:34,620 --> 02:05:36,630
No,
they would go into a theater in Chicago.

3037
02:05:36,631 --> 02:05:41,631
So the uh,
the became took codes and you have them 

3038
02:05:41,631 --> 02:05:42,480
on the top side of your screen,
right?

3039
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:45,780
Narrows it down to the theater and 
that's how they know,

3040
02:05:45,781 --> 02:05:50,781
you know,
so they can break down the images and 

3041
02:05:50,781 --> 02:05:50,781
they could find in the movie,
boom.

3042
02:05:50,781 --> 02:05:54,060
They go to the top feeder out of like,
where do we go?

3043
02:05:54,061 --> 02:05:59,061
What's that club we went to.
It wasn't Chicago but it was the one 

3044
02:05:59,061 --> 02:06:02,661
with the older Sharpsburg.
It's right in that area because I don't 

3045
02:06:02,661 --> 02:06:04,620
want them showing it.
And it was an AMC and AMC said fuck it.

3046
02:06:04,621 --> 02:06:07,230
So they put codes on the film then,
but how they know who did it,

3047
02:06:07,610 --> 02:06:12,610
they don't know who did it.
But I guess the theater is getting 

3048
02:06:12,610 --> 02:06:14,920
charged for it,
so they have to make sure they have 

3049
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:14,920
ushers that go in and look for cameras 
and grow.

3050
02:06:15,290 --> 02:06:16,900
They find the theater.
Right.

3051
02:06:17,030 --> 02:06:22,030
Well,
this theater here at this day that he 

3052
02:06:22,030 --> 02:06:22,040
has this ring,
all the ushers were part of the rent.

3053
02:06:22,590 --> 02:06:27,590
Oh.
So that's how they knew that it was the 

3054
02:06:27,590 --> 02:06:27,770
screen.
And I used to buy old school

3055
02:06:28,410 --> 02:06:33,410
back in New York.
We could walk down the street and be 

3056
02:06:33,410 --> 02:06:33,410
walking home from a comedy club and 
there'd be some fucking guy was.

3057
02:06:33,410 --> 02:06:35,450
He had a little box out looking for 
people.

3058
02:06:35,470 --> 02:06:37,170
They just put that.
Put that video on the computer.

3059
02:06:37,180 --> 02:06:38,800
Yeah,
these guys would do it on vhs.

3060
02:06:38,801 --> 02:06:41,740
They would make copies and every fucking
copy would be,

3061
02:06:41,741 --> 02:06:43,270
you know,
Shittier and Shittier.

3062
02:06:43,390 --> 02:06:46,030
So if you came to the dude like a couple
of weeks after the movie was out,

3063
02:06:46,031 --> 02:06:51,031
you're getting like fourth and fifth 
generation vhs copies of some fucking 

3064
02:06:51,031 --> 02:06:54,391
Bruce Willis movie.
So tomorrow you're going to have bill 

3065
02:06:54,391 --> 02:06:54,391
burr on the posts coming in tomorrow at 
3:00.

3066
02:06:54,391 --> 02:06:59,040
Cool.
This weekend I'm in three different 

3067
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:01,801
places.
I'm going on a fucking mad candidate 

3068
02:07:01,801 --> 02:07:02,110
tour.
I'll tell you where I'm at right now,

3069
02:07:02,530 --> 02:07:03,390
and we said,
well,

3070
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:07,090
at the end we should always sponsor is 
fleshlight.com

3071
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:12,840
100 times in the contract we had to do 
at the beginning of the contract.

3072
02:07:14,090 --> 02:07:15,900
Smarsh track.
Alright.

3073
02:07:16,130 --> 02:07:20,890
I'm in Saskatoon on Thursday night at 
the Saskatoon Arts Intervention Center.

3074
02:07:21,100 --> 02:07:26,100
I'm in Grand Prairie,
Alberta at the Cran prairie regional 

3075
02:07:26,100 --> 02:07:30,631
college and then I'm in Winnipeg and at 
the Burton Cummings Theater.

3076
02:07:30,771 --> 02:07:33,520
So this is my just three Canada stop 
weekend.

3077
02:07:33,970 --> 02:07:36,310
I'm looking forward to that.
Canada is always a good time.

3078
02:07:36,490 --> 02:07:39,340
They won't let Joey Diaz up there 
because he's a fucking criminal.

3079
02:07:40,090 --> 02:07:41,590
You ever tried to get to Canada?
Yeah,

3080
02:07:41,620 --> 02:07:43,540
they turned me down two years ago.
What did I say?

3081
02:07:44,030 --> 02:07:45,370
Uh,
they didn't tell the club,

3082
02:07:45,371 --> 02:07:48,880
but it was,
it just said my passport was no good and

3083
02:07:48,910 --> 02:07:51,820
I didn't know what it was.
I know Canada is and let you in.

3084
02:07:51,821 --> 02:07:53,170
If you have a salt,
they don't let you in.

3085
02:07:53,171 --> 02:07:54,730
If you have a felony,
they don't let you in.

3086
02:07:54,731 --> 02:07:56,440
If you're a drunk driver,
they don't let you in.

3087
02:07:56,441 --> 02:08:01,441
If you're fucked up at all,
either Dui and they don't fuck around 

3088
02:08:01,441 --> 02:08:01,441
man,
but you know what,

3089
02:08:01,441 --> 02:08:02,680
it's one of the reasons why Canada is so
nice candidates.

3090
02:08:02,710 --> 02:08:05,260
Fucking nice man.
People are nice and shit up there.

3091
02:08:05,410 --> 02:08:10,410
Especially in Vancouver because 
Vancouver doesn't really get that cold 

3092
02:08:10,410 --> 02:08:13,360
and now it doesn't get like Boston 
called slows a little bit here and 

3093
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:13,360
there,
but it's mostly rain in the winter,

3094
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:14,590
you know,
pretty temperate climate,

3095
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:16,180
a little rainy and shit,
you know,

3096
02:08:16,181 --> 02:08:17,200
it gets rainy,
but Goddamn,

3097
02:08:17,270 --> 02:08:19,230
it's cool up there.
Restaurants are awesome.

3098
02:08:19,240 --> 02:08:20,950
People are cool.
The UFC,

3099
02:08:20,951 --> 02:08:25,951
there was fucking funny as shit.
I had a good time but I suck because I 

3100
02:08:25,951 --> 02:08:27,080
couldn't do a show because they usually 
have a.

3101
02:08:27,140 --> 02:08:32,140
I usually get booked at the uh,
red Robinson theater and unfortunately 

3102
02:08:32,140 --> 02:08:34,330
they had a gig there already and they 
couldn't cancel it and I couldn't.

3103
02:08:34,331 --> 02:08:39,331
So.
And they didn't want me doing a local 

3104
02:08:39,331 --> 02:08:39,331
show.
We like a little place.

3105
02:08:39,331 --> 02:08:42,030
I'm like,
what if I just do like a little rock 

3106
02:08:42,030 --> 02:08:42,030
club or something like that.

3107
02:08:42,030 --> 02:08:42,820
They wanted me to not do it totally.
They moved to UFC from Utah because they

3108
02:08:42,821 --> 02:08:44,770
couldn't sell tickets.
Selling tickets on Sunday.

3109
02:08:44,771 --> 02:08:46,160
Man,
that's a Jesus Day.

3110
02:08:46,690 --> 02:08:51,690
Awesome chick fil a deck.
Two in Utah is very religious man.

3111
02:08:53,140 --> 02:08:54,790
People are very religious.
You know,

3112
02:08:54,791 --> 02:08:58,450
it's a strong mormon community and a 
strong religious community.

3113
02:08:58,660 --> 02:09:00,130
People don't want to go out on a Sunday 
night.

3114
02:09:00,131 --> 02:09:01,980
It's tough.
It's amazing.

3115
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:05,930
Who else?
The UFC cells like it's a Utah.

3116
02:09:06,830 --> 02:09:10,660
You can criticize that.
I could.

3117
02:09:10,661 --> 02:09:12,290
I'm saying myself,
but you know,

3118
02:09:12,291 --> 02:09:14,850
you're looking at Utah and I fucking 
played there.

3119
02:09:15,240 --> 02:09:16,120
You know,
it's pretty,

3120
02:09:16,150 --> 02:09:21,150
pretty decent place to live and I heard 
a lot of those Utah girls kind of 

3121
02:09:21,150 --> 02:09:21,150
slowly.
Of course they are all religious.

3122
02:09:21,590 --> 02:09:24,520
You're fucking crazy.
They get a little crazy,

3123
02:09:24,521 --> 02:09:25,510
right?
The army base.

3124
02:09:25,511 --> 02:09:28,550
I used to drive up there from boulder 
and shit.

3125
02:09:29,470 --> 02:09:34,470
If you want your kid to be a freak 
number one rule of thumb is making 

3126
02:09:34,470 --> 02:09:34,510
religious cause you're gonna get one or 
two things.

3127
02:09:34,511 --> 02:09:39,511
You're going to get a really crazy 
scared religious adult or you're going 

3128
02:09:39,511 --> 02:09:42,421
to get someone who rebels just shocks 
the first time they suck that 16.

3129
02:09:43,060 --> 02:09:48,060
She just stops.
She takes that fucking cross and the 

3130
02:09:48,060 --> 02:09:50,320
cross curls up.
It's darker.

3131
02:09:50,321 --> 02:09:51,700
The Berry,
the sweeter the juice.

3132
02:09:51,701 --> 02:09:56,701
Fuck yeah.
She can't wait to get some black dick 

3133
02:09:56,701 --> 02:09:56,701
too.
Right?

3134
02:09:56,701 --> 02:09:56,710
The crisis at target.
What?

3135
02:09:57,270 --> 02:10:01,080
The cross is a target for Brian.
You know,

3136
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:06,280
I took it to a bad place.
There's no need to end the show on such 

3137
02:10:06,280 --> 02:10:06,280
a sour note.

3138
02:10:08,290 --> 02:10:10,300
Baby.
Jesus.

3139
02:10:10,780 --> 02:10:12,970

3145

Uh,

3149
02:10:38,750 --> 02:10:39,680
Donna sub,

3150
02:10:39,681 --> 02:10:42,310
on Friday bitches at the Hollywood bowl.
Oh,

3151
02:10:42,320 --> 02:10:42,970
you're going to go see.
Hey.

3152
02:10:42,980 --> 02:10:45,200
Ready?
Saying that you want to come right here?

3153
02:10:46,120 --> 02:10:51,120
I got fucking tickets.
They're adopting her in the hall of 

3154
02:10:51,120 --> 02:10:51,410
fame.
He having sex with that night?

3155
02:10:51,411 --> 02:10:52,430
Nobody.
No one.

3156
02:10:52,460 --> 02:10:57,460
No.
But we can take a bus ride from your 

3157
02:10:57,460 --> 02:10:59,641
house.
That dropped us off right in front of 

3158
02:10:59,641 --> 02:10:59,641
the fucking starts to glow sticks.

3159
02:10:59,641 --> 02:10:59,641
I got.
And a pacifier.

3160
02:10:59,641 --> 02:11:03,560
Let's get this show.
Can we use your pacifier?

3161
02:11:04,130 --> 02:11:05,300
No.
You know what?

3162
02:11:05,390 --> 02:11:09,560
I forgot how fucking good domus Donna 
summer was.

3163
02:11:10,090 --> 02:11:15,090
Really forgot.
I put it in the other day and I felt 

3164
02:11:15,090 --> 02:11:15,090
really Good Friday.
No,

3165
02:11:15,090 --> 02:11:15,330
dude,
this is.

3166
02:11:15,340 --> 02:11:16,150
This is.
This is.

3167
02:11:16,180 --> 02:11:20,060
This is what I remembered.
I remembered when Joey Diaz told me,

3168
02:11:20,270 --> 02:11:23,410
Joey Diaz and I were at the fucking Bray
Improv.

3169
02:11:23,440 --> 02:11:24,550
Was it the brain?
We,

3170
02:11:24,850 --> 02:11:28,130
we're the brain improv and I pull up in 
my truck,

3171
02:11:28,131 --> 02:11:30,410
has a real good sound system,
and he goes,

3172
02:11:30,411 --> 02:11:32,890
put this in your fucking car right now.
Joe Robin,

3173
02:11:32,900 --> 02:11:34,940
put this in your fucking car.
He goes,

3174
02:11:34,941 --> 02:11:39,941
put on his fucking track.
Put on this track so it puts on hot 

3175
02:11:39,941 --> 02:11:42,761
stuff.
This fucking truck right here is this 

3176
02:11:42,761 --> 02:11:42,761
guy to come out?

3177
02:11:44,190 --> 02:11:45,270
Yeah.

3178
02:11:47,500 --> 02:11:48,100
No.

3179
02:11:55,840 --> 02:11:59,780
Yeah.
So for you people on itunes just playing

3180
02:11:59,781 --> 02:12:04,781
a song and he's dancing and joey doing 
joey ideas is doing the wave.

3181
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:07,330
No joke.

3182
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:13,840
And you could find me at five and some 
weed to smoke.

3183
02:12:19,750 --> 02:12:24,750
Sorry for the fine right now.
I'm trying to turn it down because Jay 

3184
02:12:24,750 --> 02:12:25,800
was going to kill all your ears.
Mute,

3185
02:12:25,860 --> 02:12:27,060
mute,
mute,

3186
02:12:27,180 --> 02:12:30,900
mute.
Mute your laptop.

3187
02:12:32,580 --> 02:12:34,230
Here we go.
Ladies and gentlemen,

3188
02:12:34,231 --> 02:12:35,710
that's not the most professional thing 
in the world.

3189
02:12:35,711 --> 02:12:36,990
The point is.
Sorry about that.

3190
02:12:37,890 --> 02:12:39,240
Shouldn't that be pushing buttons over 
here,

3191
02:12:39,241 --> 02:12:42,870
Brian?
I don't know what I'm saying.

3192
02:12:42,871 --> 02:12:44,080
It's me.
Shouldn't have.

3193
02:12:44,310 --> 02:12:47,880
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
The point is I forgotten a fucking good.

3194
02:12:47,881 --> 02:12:48,720
Donna summer was.
We were.

3195
02:12:48,721 --> 02:12:51,850
We were smoking a joint outside the 
brain improv in the parking lot and joey

3196
02:12:51,870 --> 02:12:54,510
puts on hot stuff and and I wrote a song
about it.

3197
02:12:54,511 --> 02:12:55,830
I wrote,
I wrote a blog about it,

3198
02:12:55,831 --> 02:12:57,370
about Donna.
Summer was a bad ass.

3199
02:12:57,590 --> 02:13:02,590
It's amazing.
Somebody wrote a blog about that night 

3200
02:13:02,590 --> 02:13:02,590
because it was so powerful.
I was listening to that music.

3201
02:13:02,590 --> 02:13:02,790
I'm like,
God damn,

3202
02:13:02,791 --> 02:13:05,790
that music was good.
That chick didn't give a fuck.

3203
02:13:06,950 --> 02:13:11,950
I had the opposite reaction happened to 
me last week when I pit Donna summer on 

3204
02:13:11,950 --> 02:13:13,830
a on a road trip and my girlfriend goes,
what are you a faggot?

3205
02:13:15,670 --> 02:13:16,650
I was like,
yeah,

3206
02:13:16,651 --> 02:13:18,660
this does sound pretty gay when you say 
it like that.

3207
02:13:21,120 --> 02:13:25,350
She had some jamming songs were two p,
p,

3208
02:13:25,520 --> 02:13:25,890
p,
p,

3209
02:13:26,430 --> 02:13:26,930
p,
p,

3210
02:13:27,050 --> 02:13:28,430
p,
p,

3211
02:13:28,600 --> 02:13:29,820
p.
like I said,

3212
02:13:29,821 --> 02:13:33,630
she's a very intelligent girl.
Everyone's got their own taste.

3213
02:13:33,670 --> 02:13:38,670
Brian,
Donna summer is just totally 

3214
02:13:38,670 --> 02:13:41,331
unnecessary,
but it's right every now and then you 

3215
02:13:41,331 --> 02:13:41,331
got to respect that.
There's some shit that's not.

3216
02:13:41,331 --> 02:13:42,660
It's not like cool to like,
but it's fun.

3217
02:13:42,770 --> 02:13:44,950
Good.
I agree.

3218
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:50,000
I was.
I was in a bar the other day and 

3219
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:50,000
journey.
Don't stop believing.

3220
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:50,880
Started playing and I was like,
God damn,

3221
02:13:50,881 --> 02:13:52,850
that was good fucking song.
Oh my God.

3222
02:13:52,880 --> 02:13:55,680
Journey.
I listened to some of night will,

3223
02:13:55,710 --> 02:13:57,960
so it was ideal.
It was fucking great.

3224
02:13:57,970 --> 02:13:59,670
I'm like,
I forgot how good journey was.

3225
02:13:59,810 --> 02:14:03,900
The journey had some heads that guy had 
a very unusual voice and God damn did he

3226
02:14:03,901 --> 02:14:07,200
connect with fat pitches.
Fat pitches will go crazy journey.

3227
02:14:07,201 --> 02:14:11,540
So Kenny,
the gambler and love that,

3228
02:14:11,670 --> 02:14:16,670
they love that chicken chicken company,
chicken company,

3229
02:14:17,120 --> 02:14:19,890
Kenny Rogers roasters and shit.
You know Jimmy Dean died.

3230
02:14:20,070 --> 02:14:22,260
Jimmy Dean,
sausage lead sources for 30.

3231
02:14:22,310 --> 02:14:27,310
That motherfucker was 81.
He just drank booze every day and 

3232
02:14:27,310 --> 02:14:28,470
sausage and he lived to be 81.
Can you imagine the jokes and.

3233
02:14:28,471 --> 02:14:30,060
Haha.
Is he had with his wife at lunch.

3234
02:14:30,061 --> 02:14:31,200
You took my sausage,
you know,

3235
02:14:31,230 --> 02:14:31,740
Shit like that.

3236
02:14:35,790 --> 02:14:38,970
When that guy had so much money,
I bet he'd just mounted his wife's face.

3237
02:14:38,971 --> 02:14:40,800
Didn't even ask her questions.
Pull those pants.

3238
02:14:40,801 --> 02:14:43,230
I probably didn't even talk about it.
It's probably didn't say the thing.

3239
02:14:43,270 --> 02:14:46,840
He's so retched.
Polish sausage again,

3240
02:14:46,890 --> 02:14:51,890
bitch drinking whiskey.
Just fucking her mouth shoots a batch 

3241
02:14:51,890 --> 02:14:52,440
town it's throat and walks out the door 
and gets on a horse.

3242
02:14:52,500 --> 02:14:54,240
Can Be fucking Jimmy,
Jimmy Dean,

3243
02:14:54,241 --> 02:14:55,500
you know,
billion dollar sausage.

02:14:55,501 --> 02:14:57,420
Empire.
And he started out as a musician,

3245
02:14:57,500 --> 02:14:58,860
right?
There wasn't.

3246
02:14:58,870 --> 02:15:01,140
It wasn't one of those fucking things.
Maybe it was.

3247
02:15:01,280 --> 02:15:02,370
You know what?
Good for him.

3248
02:15:02,600 --> 02:15:04,740
This episode is dedicated to you,
Jimmy Dean.

3249

Good for you.
