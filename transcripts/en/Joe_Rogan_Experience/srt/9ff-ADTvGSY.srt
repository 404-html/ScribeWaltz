1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,560
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,460
What was tell what
happened with the dense,

3
00:00:05,461 --> 00:00:06,630
you have someone hostage.

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,493
Can you talk about that?

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,880
Can you talk about what apps
you 87 I was 27 years old,

6
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:12,181
whatever.

7
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:13,290
I was working in boulder.

8
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,970
I was going to school at night and I
was snorting coke with three hands and

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,270
fucking uh,

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,340
got involved with some kid and he was
going to rob his roommate and ended up

11
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:23,791
robbing them,

12
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:24,624
both of them.

13
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,320
That's the guy that I had a part in.

14
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:27,240
It was going to rob me.

15
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:31,440
What a tangled web we weave when we
tangled to deceit and it just so happens

16
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:33,060
that the guy got caught.

17
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:33,540
Like I told,

18
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,190
I told him the guy didn't
want nothing to do with it,

19
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:36,630
even though I had the coke with me,

20
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,040
I sent the coke to ask him,

21
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:38,611
but the other guy,

22
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:39,750
they got to tried to rob me.

23
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,780
He ended up getting pulled over with
the guy we kidnapped in the trunk of his

24
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:43,080
car,

25
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,700
all fucking bangles up and shit.

26
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,840
So I got arrested for the kidnapping,

27
00:00:46,841 --> 00:00:47,850
kidnapping too and everything.

28
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:49,410
But you know what?

29
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:50,280
I fucked up.

30
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,050
It wasn't because I fucked up.

31
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,220
It wasn't because America,

32
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:53,971
listen bro,

33
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:54,870
I tend to seven.

34
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:59,580
I got a ticket this morning for
$200 10 cents seven this morning.

35
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,990
For what?

36
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,400
Fuck you.

37
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,233
Buckets were sleeping.

38
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,910
I was going to Tai Chi at
seven so I had to drive there.

39
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:04,981
So my wife said,

40
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,830
if you have to go to the [inaudible]
seven you might as well drop me off at the

41
00:01:07,831 --> 00:01:08,431
train station.

42
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:10,500
I usually walk them every
morning to the train station,

43
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,431
but I drove her.

44
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:13,350
There was a lunch truck
there I couldn't pull over,

45
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:15,780
so I pulled by where
she crosses the street.

46
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,920
When I made the right,

47
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:17,741
when I made the left,

48
00:01:17,741 --> 00:01:18,540
there was a cop behind me.

49
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:18,751
He goes,

50
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:19,350
Bro,

51
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,670
the bus drivers complain.

52
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:20,971
He goes,

53
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:22,200
it's a thousand dollar ticket.

54
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,170
I have to give you a $200
ticket for parking instead.

55
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:26,004
Is that okay?

56
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,930
And I took the ticket and
I was not angry at him.

57
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:28,740
I went to [inaudible].

58
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,573
I did my thing.

59
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,260
I didn't mention that he did his job.

60
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,123
This is America.

61
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,690
He did his fucking job.

62
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,730
You follow him saying to you?

63
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,460
A lot of people would of got pissed
off at this guy for pulling me over.

64
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,910
He did his fucking job.

65
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,770
You know when I kidnapped that guy,

66
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:41,551
I kidnap them.

67
00:01:41,551 --> 00:01:42,330
I did that.

68
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,163
I got four years.

69
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,280
I got all fucking easy.

70
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,950
They should have called me in
there for 10 fucking years,

71
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,770
but people don't really see much time.

72
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:50,850
Did you actually do 18 months?

73
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:51,840
16 months?

74
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,481
That's a long time.

75
00:01:52,481 --> 00:01:54,000
It costs me two years of my life.

76
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,350
You don't know what your life,

77
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:55,920
how precedent.

78
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,640
Horrible.

79
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,091
No,

80
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:57,751
it wasn't horrible.

81
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,160
It let's do it standing on my head,

82
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,293
but

83
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,140
I could do that timely time,

84
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:04,381
bro.

85
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:05,790
And you do time guys.

86
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,740
Like you'd only it just
another day in paradise.

87
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,380
They're going to take us to a place
where we get the bullshit about Jujitsu

88
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,580
instead of two hours a day,

89
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:12,414
eight hours a day.

90
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,190
You follow me and you eat and whatever.

91
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,450
Your freedom gets lost,

92
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:16,200
which sucks,

93
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,280
but it's the people at home.

94
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,210
It's not you or whatever.

95
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,550
I can do whatever the fuck I get,

96
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,031
Bro.

97
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:23,200
My jeans are from Cuban
motherfucker telling me about,

98
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,060
I smoked the weed.

99
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,640
Castro smoked before he went
to the mountains to take over.

100
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,910
You understand me now?

101
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,160
What was a typical day in prison like
for you at that six month you're in there

102
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:33,060
six months.

103
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,100
What's a typical day
live in like a doctor.

104
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,263
He liked him,

105
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,121
Bro.

106
00:02:37,121 --> 00:02:38,910
You gotta remember I went
to prison for four years.

107
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:39,481
I got sentenced,

108
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:39,931
but guess what?

109
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:40,764
I became,

110
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,330
I became a standup comic.

111
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:45,330
I learned how to do standup
in prison on Thursday nights.

112
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,400
They used to have movie night.

113
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,410
I didn't even know that dog.

114
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,290
They used to have movie
night on Thursday night.

115
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,130
So the projector would always fuck up
like Ustream and would always fuck up.

116
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,210
Joey talking to the microphone.

117
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:55,140
It would always fuck up.

118
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,930
So on Thursdays the people just jokingly,

119
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:58,960
I would always go,

120
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,400
what the fuck is wrong
with the projected no.

121
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:02,590
Everybody would say Cuba
get up there and talk.

122
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,270
So I would go up there on Thursday nights.

123
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:04,630
It was like,

124
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:04,890
you know,

125
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,020
you want your people and like a hundred
of them were black so they called cubic

126
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:08,854
walk down and talk.

127
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,510
And I would make fun of the black guys.

128
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,231
Like what would it be?

129
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:12,064
What would you say?

130
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,461
You know,

131
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:13,510
we make fun of the kitchen,

132
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,480
the kitchen of your standup career.

133
00:03:17,481 --> 00:03:20,960
You're getting those 10 we
used to make for the ice roles.

134
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:21,790
I fucking,

135
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,720
the first day in prison,

136
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:23,590
they may be a baker.

137
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,161
You know,

138
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:24,431
you don't,

139
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:25,630
you don't tell people what you want.

140
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:26,370
It's like Cuba.

141
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:26,870
Like yeah,

142
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,420
the outside that was a mechanic really.

143
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,620
Well in here you're a baker.

144
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,090
Here's a book,

145
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,110
learn how to make bagels.

146
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,700
Rolls.

147
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,620
Dog almost blew up the kitchen.

148
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:36,070
Right?

149
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,230
These mother fuckers afternoon,

150
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,610
they fired me as a baker and they made
me a fucking dishwasher at a stock room

151
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,453
quite right.

152
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,060
So I was a dishwasher,

153
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,710
the stock room cloak and
whenever they had shitty meals,

154
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,840
the guys I knew when they
were going through the line,

155
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,823
I would yell,

156
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,950
don't do it.

157
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,000
So I would go go.

158
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,670
How often were the meals?

159
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:58,840
Three times a week.

160
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,590
But it didn't matter because at lunch
time I was allowed to go to the store for

161
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:03,281
15 minutes.

162
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:04,114
I worked it out.

163
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:04,441
Well,

164
00:04:04,441 --> 00:04:05,920
I had a drive to take garbage out,

165
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:07,360
so I would go to the store for 15 minutes.

166
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:08,194
Not only that,

167
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,270
I would call it my own at
the Chinese restaurant.

168
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,190
So it would be ready by
the time I got there.

169
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:15,130
So I would go back to the prison
with Chinese food and groceries.

170
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,510
That's how strong I was in there
plus fuck around and call us.

171
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,710
They were doing steroids and
selling drugs in prison ways.

172
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,560
Like a motherfucker.

173
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,680
I was in the stock room clerk
so they had to pay me rent.

174
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,000
So how cause they never,

175
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,110
once you stopped,

176
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:29,880
you stopped.

177
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,430
I would say you,

178
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:30,740
yeah,

179
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:30,920
I'll,

180
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,753
I'll hold your voice.

181
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,910
You got to get $3.

182
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:34,744
You know,

183
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,460
you gotta give me some cigarettes.

184
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,020
I had roids cigarettes,

185
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:42,310
I had pills in their lap.

186
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,203
They weren't mine.

187
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,500
They just belong to other people.

188
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:45,940
But you put them on the pallets.

189
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,530
So I would give them a key whenever
they need it to go take shit out.

190
00:04:48,531 --> 00:04:49,690
So they were the connection.

191
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,111
I was the,

192
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:50,501
I was the,

193
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:50,711
no,

194
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:51,910
I was the holdup.

195
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,260
Plus,

196
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,560
did they get the steroids in?

197
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:54,610
Somebody had to put it up their ass.

198
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,793
I don't know.

199
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:56,621
I don't know.

200
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:58,950
I never imagine shooting
a steroid in nearby.

201
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,270
How do they smuggled it in again?

202
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,123
Up the rest of it.

203
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,340
Then they get,

204
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,440
then they put it where
that contact visits,

205
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,091
right.

206
00:05:06,091 --> 00:05:09,770
You'd do is you take your fucking kid
and you fill his pockets with the yummy

207
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,680
this and why you're making
out with your husband.

208
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,560
You said you want to see the kid and
you pass the kid to the husband and he

209
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:15,730
takes the drugs that did.

210
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:16,564
It gives you back.

211
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,150
That's,

212
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,180
that's how Henry Hill did it.

213
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:21,861
That's how they do it.

214
00:05:21,861 --> 00:05:22,670
Same Shit.

215
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,151
It's no,

216
00:05:23,151 --> 00:05:23,871
you can bro.

217
00:05:23,871 --> 00:05:25,340
There's more drugs on the inside.

218
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:27,350
That was the ones on
the outside and to boot.

219
00:05:27,351 --> 00:05:29,090
This was a minimum security camp.

220
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,830
We had contact visits.

221
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,060
When you have a contact visit,

222
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,590
there's parties every night.

223
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,601
These motherfuckers.

224
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:38,570
That's the first time I did it,

225
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:39,021
but I was like,

226
00:05:39,021 --> 00:05:40,560
the second time I did heroin was it,

227
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:41,691
and I didn't,

228
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:42,524
couldn't do a needle.

229
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,431
So the Mexican was,

230
00:05:43,431 --> 00:05:44,570
took a Mexican thing,

231
00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:45,530
a heroin melted it.

232
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,150
I had to put like a funnel in mind.

233
00:05:47,151 --> 00:05:49,930
Those made out of paper when they
dripped to them my nose and I got up,

234
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:51,050
I had like candle wick,

235
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,893
Bro,

236
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,570
what the fuck is this?

237
00:05:53,571 --> 00:05:53,870
They're like,

238
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,740
that's heroin man.

239
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,551
Be Cool.

240
00:05:55,551 --> 00:05:56,900
I was like this like a day.

241
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,060
And then the white dudes,

242
00:05:59,210 --> 00:05:59,500
Mike,

243
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,160
it gimmie speed and they would
play basketball all fucking night.

244
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,433
They'll be out there

245
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,230
and I'd be out there with them.

246
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:10,790
Huffington post every
week was a new adventure,

247
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,213
every drug,

248
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,503
but the drug

249
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,853
was out there

250
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,733
fucking

251
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,300
minimum security prison where everyone's
partying and it took just the greatest

252
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:29,930
time ever.

253
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,460
But I let it take up on like when you get,

254
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:31,930
when you,

255
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:32,190
when you,

256
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:32,820
when you,

257
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,071
you know,

258
00:06:33,071 --> 00:06:33,891
you get released.

259
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:34,724
It's like,

260
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,310
are the ones that I went to a funeral.

261
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,931
You got talk in the mic.

262
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:39,950
People keep complaining about it.

263
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:40,280
I was,

264
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:40,660
I was,

265
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,050
I was,

266
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:41,610
I was at,

267
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,740
when I go to the halfway house,

268
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,190
it was even better because
I started loaning money out
to the Invictus as a loan

269
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:47,020
shark fix.

270
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,190
Yeah,

271
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,120
because they want to go on,

272
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:49,590
but if your rent's not paid on Thursday,

273
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,510
not allowed for the weekend,

274
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,680
so the rent would be $65 I give him 65
and [inaudible] 92 you know what I'm

275
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:54,831
saying?

276
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,580
Like I'm going to give you $65 but you
gotta give me 92 tomorrow and I had 10

277
00:06:58,581 --> 00:06:59,414
guys on that role.

278
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,070
I was a fucking machine in there.

279
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,710
Gamma had at the camp,

280
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,060
the biggest scam I had was with,

281
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:08,430
there was an old Italian
dude from Brooklyn,

282
00:07:08,431 --> 00:07:12,330
he was like a half a mobster and he had
pool cards and he would only do one card

283
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:12,631
a week.

284
00:07:12,631 --> 00:07:13,860
You would make like 30 bucks.

285
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,001
And I went up to him,

286
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:15,241
I go,

287
00:07:15,241 --> 00:07:15,451
Bro,

288
00:07:15,451 --> 00:07:16,800
you have a problem with these cards.

289
00:07:16,801 --> 00:07:17,020
I go,

290
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,360
you're giving them to white guys.

291
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,920
You're not getting the black population.

292
00:07:19,921 --> 00:07:20,970
You got to get in the fucking specs.

293
00:07:20,971 --> 00:07:21,301
And he goes,

294
00:07:21,301 --> 00:07:21,631
I don't know.

295
00:07:21,631 --> 00:07:22,464
They won't talk to me.

296
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:22,891
I said,

297
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:23,730
give me the fucking cards.

298
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,690
We're going to go partners.

299
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,200
He went from selling one card every
Monday they're doing 10 with me.

300
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,450
Cause I had the brothers,

301
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,320
I had the Puerto Ricans,

302
00:07:31,321 --> 00:07:34,320
I had the whites at
everybody and it was amazing.

303
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,900
That's why I really learned that
I could really fucking do this.

304
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,060
So on Thursday nights they would say Cuba,

305
00:07:39,061 --> 00:07:39,721
fuck the movie.

306
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:41,160
Just go up there and
talk about the kitchen.

307
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,173
And they were all,

308
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,111
all the yarns,

309
00:07:43,111 --> 00:07:44,700
but y'all don't do it.

310
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,650
It was fucking hysterical.

311
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,050
Talk about

312
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:49,141
that.

313
00:07:49,141 --> 00:07:50,820
And then I had this one crazy black guy.

314
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,290
This guy was Anton Spencer,

315
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,640
his name was Spencer Antwan from
New Orleans and he was crazy.

316
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,571
And he called me,

317
00:07:57,571 --> 00:08:00,390
he told me that he was in there for
eight years but involuntary manslaughter.

318
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,800
And he was my mentor.

319
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:03,090
That was my dog Jack.

320
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,500
He was fucking nuts.

321
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:07,560
And he would tell me like one day some
guy nailed him $2 and he comes to the

322
00:08:07,561 --> 00:08:07,861
kitchen.

323
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:08,280
He goes,

324
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,240
but you see that guy?

325
00:08:09,241 --> 00:08:09,541
And I go,

326
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:09,691
no,

327
00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:11,190
I think he's packing and leaving.

328
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,110
This motherfucker went and got a knife.

329
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,690
He got them at the gate as the
guy was getting out of jail.

330
00:08:15,691 --> 00:08:16,260
He's like,

331
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:16,680
motherfucker,

332
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,700
you better get my $2.

333
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,810
I was blown away.

334
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:19,501
I'm like,

335
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:22,560
this guy was old and his parents
and family had money there.

336
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:24,740
That's like the best attorney
from brothers got killed.

337
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,660
Somebody but his hands
and he got eight years.

338
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:28,540
Wow.

339
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,161
A black guy.

340
00:08:29,161 --> 00:08:29,310
And,

341
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,143
and and uh,

342
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,103
in La,

343
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,003
downtown La,

344
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,090
because I was in a federal place.

345
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:38,300
He beat him with his fucking hands
and got say eight years for voluntary

346
00:08:38,761 --> 00:08:39,330
manslaughter.

347
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,520
He had like $50,000 attorney's he's got,

348
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,630
but he had a knife.

349
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,070
He got a gold tooth in his mouth.

350
00:08:44,071 --> 00:08:46,650
He was one of those brothers and
shifted his eyes would go crazy.

351
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,290
I went in there every Thursday I get on
stage and then one day this is fucked up

352
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:52,801
Joe Rogan.

353
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:55,950
This is why I really dig it
because one day guy in the library,

354
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:57,090
it was like a nerdy dude.

355
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,670
The guy that ran the library
and I was friends with them.

356
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:00,271
We did acid.

357
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:03,190
He was very into Nostradamus and you know,

358
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,730
he was intelligent but he had just,

359
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:05,860
he had some problem or some,

360
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,703
he went to prison.

361
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,720
And the funny thing was that one day
he came up to me and the jail and a

362
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:13,620
notebook was a big thing and I was
getting ready to get out and I never even

363
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:14,160
thought about it.

364
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,240
He came up to me and then he goes,

365
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:15,571
hey bro,

366
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:16,440
I got you a notebook.

367
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:17,941
And I go,

368
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:18,751
what's the notebook for?

369
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:18,961
It goes,

370
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:20,700
so when you get out you
could write some jokes.

371
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:21,360
He goes,

372
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,780
he goes,

373
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,160
every week you write jokes.

374
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:24,060
I never see the notebook.

375
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:24,894
And I looked at him and I go,

376
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,620
I don't even right and this
motherfucker went nuts.

377
00:09:28,621 --> 00:09:28,891
He goes,

378
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:29,491
you don't right.

379
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:31,050
And you go up there
every week and do that.

380
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,461
He goes,

381
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:33,191
when you get out of here,

382
00:09:33,191 --> 00:09:33,480
you were,

383
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,313
it was like an angel.

384
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,161
It was like an angel.

385
00:09:35,161 --> 00:09:36,220
I never seen the guy again.

386
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,230
I never heard from him again.

387
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,483
He just goes,

388
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,570
what I watched you do.

389
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:41,190
You really need to write
and get it together.

390
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:41,780
Wow.

391
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,660
Cause you have a gift.

392
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:46,680
Just pursue this and that guy never even
talked to me like he never used to talk

393
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:47,060
to me.

394
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,390
I just set it out of the blue.

395
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:48,901
I got blue,

396
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:49,591
came up to me one day.

397
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:49,801
He goes,

398
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:50,020
Hey,

399
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,940
I got your notebook,

400
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,093
the black guy,

401
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,131
white guy,

402
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:54,330
white nerdy guy.

403
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,390
That was like a really nerdy guy that
would always roll his own cigarettes or

404
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,660
some random guy came up.

405
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,080
Do you think that if
you didn't go to prison,

406
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:06,480
if he didn't have that experience of
talking in front of those people that you

407
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:07,860
probably never would
have done standup over,

408
00:10:07,861 --> 00:10:09,840
stand up something that was in
the back of your head anyway,

409
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,100
it was in the back of my head.

410
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:16,130
The prison really woke the animal up
because not only I had thought I bro,

411
00:10:17,191 --> 00:10:17,551
if any,

412
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:21,510
because you had to be funny before prison
buddy who heard the niggas crazy by

413
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:22,230
Richard Pryor.

414
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,890
You had to think of,

415
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:26,140
he pushed it so hard
on that before prison.

416
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,210
I thought I was always
good at at the Deli.

417
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:31,500
I was always loved telling stories.

418
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:31,841
Yeah,

419
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:33,060
I was always good with that shit.

420
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:35,740
And then the thing that really
got me was when you go to prison,

421
00:10:35,741 --> 00:10:38,950
they do a diagnostic on you and
I like to get an attorney now.

422
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:39,480
A really,

423
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,520
that's the only thing that
irks me about my life.

424
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:42,810
Like a lot of times people say,

425
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,170
oh I slept with this guy with me is I
always wanted to know what's on that

426
00:10:46,171 --> 00:10:50,010
paperwork because it was an
intense psychological evaluation.

427
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,230
It just wasn't a guy with
a piece of paper saying,

428
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:53,610
what do you think when you see a star?

429
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,220
Like they put shit in my head,

430
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,100
electrodes and all this shit.

431
00:10:57,101 --> 00:11:00,630
It was three days of mental testing and
it was eating me alive and I wanted to

432
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:00,871
know,

433
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:03,540
I kept asking the counselor
who was from Mississippi,

434
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,590
he hated black people.

435
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:05,281
He hated specs.

436
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:06,114
He told me to my face,

437
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,780
my counselor told me cause I hate,

438
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:08,431
he goes,

439
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:09,900
I hate all you bug fuckers.

440
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,010
Spics and Nigga.

441
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:12,170
I mean that's how it goes.

442
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:13,320
Oh mark.

443
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,011
And he said to me,

444
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:14,700
he goes,

445
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,390
I go broke.

446
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:15,670
What he,

447
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,620
his name was mister blue.

448
00:11:16,621 --> 00:11:16,801
I go,

449
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:17,760
what are you going to fucking tell me?

450
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,560
What's on there and one day he's like,

451
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:20,890
you really want me to table time here,

452
00:11:20,891 --> 00:11:21,724
bug fucker.

453
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,790
That's what he would call
me to my face bug fucker.

454
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:24,631
He goes,

455
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:26,340
I'll tell you what time
to hit Mr. Buck fucker.

456
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,940
It said that if you really
wanted something and I had
it that you would take it

457
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:30,774
from me.

458
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:31,561
He goes,

459
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:31,710
no,

460
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,240
you do what the fuck you want with that.

461
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:36,420
And they threw me out of his office
and I felt like a thief for three days.

462
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:37,380
That's what I read at that.

463
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,740
But what he was trying to tell me was
that anything I wanted in my life,

464
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:41,580
that's what that said,

465
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,510
that I could do anything you want.

466
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,090
You could do do it.

467
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,530
That's what he was saying.

468
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,650
That's what he was trying to beat
around and like we call calling your bug

469
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:50,130
fucker.

470
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:50,431
No,

471
00:11:50,431 --> 00:11:51,390
by saying what he said,

472
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,140
lady came up to me and he goes,

473
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:53,261
hey,

474
00:11:53,261 --> 00:11:54,880
did you understand where
I was going with that?

475
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:55,841
He goes,

476
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:56,561
you're a smart guy.

477
00:11:56,561 --> 00:11:58,970
You're not one of these guys use,

478
00:11:59,150 --> 00:11:59,540
you know,

479
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,550
don't want to experience.

480
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,280
Tell us about so first standup Gig.

481
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,323
Do you remember it?

482
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:04,601
Yeah,

483
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:05,230
I remember.

484
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,430
What made you call up that night?

485
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,700
Do you consider the ones in
prison knew first standup gigs?

486
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,560
I'm talking about first
official out of club,

487
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,960
like your first time you went up,

488
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,260
but it's,

489
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,430
I'm thinking that if you did it,

490
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,750
how many times did you do doing in prison?

491
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,670
Do you really were doing
like opening night tonight?

492
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,620
I was doing every Thursday for sure.

493
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,410
If that's not a movie I've
done a bunch of times.

494
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,820
The material.

495
00:12:24,821 --> 00:12:26,140
Did you have material planned out?

496
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,970
Did you have stuff that you repeated?

497
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,830
What was the first club was fun.

498
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,950
You don't imagine repeating the joke
in front of those yachts and all those

499
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:34,630
crazy don't Mexicans.

500
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:38,320
That's the first time I really do about
the whole heritage and they would sneak

501
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:39,820
in fucking Green Chili burritos.

502
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:40,450
Tremendous.

503
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,090
Really?

504
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:41,620
What Joe,

505
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,030
who had the best tattoo artists?

506
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,290
Was it the Mexican Mexican's?

507
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,310
Mexicans always have wild
tattoo generations of Mexicans.

508
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:50,970
At one time I was in jail
with the grandfather,

509
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,813
the ILS,

510
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,290
the father and the son.

511
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,000
Well,

512
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,240
wow,

513
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,600
that's really neat.

514
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:56,920
You start seeing that thing you'll,

515
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,630
and he's been a movie,

516
00:12:58,631 --> 00:12:59,140
right?

517
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,880
Like this is fucking crazy.

518
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,810
And I always wanted to shoot somebody
and be a criminal that at that point I

519
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:05,280
didn't.

520
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:05,560
You know,

521
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,860
I always thought about that my life
deserve more than to spend it in here.

522
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,570
That's what prison did for me,

523
00:13:10,571 --> 00:13:11,020
Bro.

524
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,630
It was,

525
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,580
if people can look through and go,

526
00:13:12,581 --> 00:13:13,414
how bad was prison?

527
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,550
Prison is how bad you make it for me,

528
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,810
for fucking me.

529
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,130
It opened my eyes.

530
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,360
I became a standup comic.

531
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:25,010
[inaudible]

532
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,000
oh shit.

533
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,480
Itunes or recording to
server the fuck outta here.

534
00:13:51,481 --> 00:13:52,050
Server.
