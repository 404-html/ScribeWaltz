1
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,200
Three,
two,

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:06,663
one.

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,420
Got a little thing going on here.
Now we'll circle co Jeff,

4
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:13,410
merry Christmas.
What's up,

5
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:14,320
Joe?
You to live it.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,230
Not been the easiest week and in my life
or my career as last week,

7
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:23,670
but hanging in there to make this a
standalone so the people don't have to

8
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:27,630
go figuring this out on their own and
I'm sure many,

9
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:30,810
many fans are 20 and already know that.
The gist of the details.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,760
Let's lay this out from the beginning.
John Jones initial failed test.

11
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,270
Yeah.
So that was July of 2017.

12
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:44,271
He tested positive for approximately 20,
anywhere from 20 to 60 Pika grams of a

13
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:51,171
longterm metabolite known as the m,
three metabolite of a substance called

14
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:55,190
to hydro chloral methyl Testosterone d,
Hcm Tea,

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,560
also known as oral to rentable.
And this was over a year ago.

16
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,810
Um,
what was determined to be the source of

17
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:06,810
this stuff?
Never determined what the source was.

18
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,570
So John went through a full arbitration
hearing,

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,990
was never able to determine where it
came from,

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,090
tested all the supplements he was using,
you know,

21
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:20,910
went through many interviews with Usada,
had a full on arbitration hearing.

22
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,100
Uh,
the source was never determined where it

23
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:27,330
came from.
Why was this suspension so low or so

24
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,193
short?
Well,

25
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,040
it wasn't determined,
so I mean there's many factors that go

26
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:36,450
into what that suspension was.
I would argue in the totality of the

27
00:01:36,451 --> 00:01:38,940
evidence that was presented in that
arbitration,

28
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:42,110
that it wasn't a short suspension.
Um,

29
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,540
because really one key thing came out at
arbitration.

30
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:49,860
So John went to arbitration before an
individual by the name of Richard

31
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,560
Mclaren.
Richard Mclaren has an arbitration group

32
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:57,210
up in Canada and Mclaren is probably
worldwide known as one of the most

33
00:01:57,211 --> 00:02:02,211
credible guys in anti-doping.
I know you had the ICARUS producer

34
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:07,370
director on the Mclaren report was the
report that came from all that.

35
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,710
He basically investigated the Russian
state being involved in doping and Sochi

36
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,720
Games and put out actually a series of
reports on it,

37
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,780
detailing that up to 1000 Russian
athletes.

38
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,800
Um,
you know,

39
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:23,550
we're breaking the rules and the Russian
laboratory was helping them get around

40
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:25,230
it.
So he's a very,

41
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:29,220
very respected guy.
He's independent of obviously the UFC.

42
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,170
He's independent of Usada.
He acts on his own and his determination

43
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:38,010
was his determination,
and I'll read you kind of what he said.

44
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,490
He said,
I find that all evidence available to me

45
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,420
leads me to conclude that the violation
was not intended,

46
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,620
nor could it have enhanced the athlete's
performance.

47
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,120
So a non-intentional so not intentional
ingestion.

48
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:57,090
I mean there's no argument that it was
in his system that he found the evidence

49
00:02:57,091 --> 00:03:01,390
to show non-intentional use.
And then he went further saying that

50
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:05,200
based on the numbers of what he saw in
the evidence that was not even a

51
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:09,310
performance enhancing benefit afforded
to John for having this longterm

52
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:10,540
metabolite in his system.

53
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,720
And I think that's significant when you
talk about hey,

54
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:17,080
15 months was that,
that's kind of light being that this is

55
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:20,080
the second time through.
I would argue that if there was an

56
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:23,380
argument that maybe it's on the Higher
Ed and certainly,

57
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,300
you know,
we'll talk about the California

58
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:27,730
commission.
Andy Foster took that position,

59
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,550
uh,
in John's recent California hearing,

60
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:33,540
he was a little bit critical of Usada.
Um,

61
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,560
he thought,
you know,

62
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,960
he's intimately familiar with is
evidence both in the previous case and

63
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:41,200
this occurrence that,
and he also saw that there was no

64
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:43,570
evidence that an independent arbitrator,
you know,

65
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:48,040
made this a statement and decision of
John Intentionally cheating.

66
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,170
Um,
so if anything,

67
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,910
you know,
I'd say that potentially there could be

68
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:55,360
an argument that,
that it was on the higher end versus the

69
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:58,840
lower end because of the fact that it
was an unintentional ingestion.

70
00:03:58,930 --> 00:03:59,440
Exactly.

71
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,540
Now,
what is John's excuse?

72
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,820
What is what it.
John said how he got this into assist.

73
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:05,560
Yeah.
Well look,

74
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,960
you know,
and it's detailed in the arbitration

75
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:10,210
hearing at all.
John John fully admits that,

76
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,950
you know,
some of the lifestyle lifestyle

77
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,810
decisions he was making,
you know,

78
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:15,790
the partying and things,
you know,

79
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:20,380
probably did not lead to making smart
decisions and making smart choices in

80
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:22,990
terms of what was being ingested in the
body.

81
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,790
But certainly his testimony was under
oath that I have never intentionally

82
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:32,500
cheated and did not intentionally put
this substance in my body and not only

83
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:34,990
this case,
but as we talk about the subsequent case

84
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:37,960
here,
I think you'll see that based on the

85
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:38,920
numbers,
you know,

86
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,330
coming out of his tests and based on
some studies that have been done on some

87
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:45,580
of these substances that would tend to
support that.

88
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,180
Okay.

89
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,990
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but didn't John tests negative then

90
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,510
tests positive for extremely low
numbers.

91
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,140
This is the initial test before we get
into the most recent film he did.

92
00:04:56,141 --> 00:05:01,141
So he tested negative then test positive
very shortly after with a very small

93
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:03,100
trace amounts.
Correct.

94
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:07,000
So you have two negative tests on July
seventh and July eighth I believe,

95
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:10,060
of 2017.
And then weigh in day,

96
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:14,650
I think it was July 28th.
He was positive for a very low level of

97
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:18,130
the three metabolite and,
and we might as well start here.

98
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:20,740
So again,
going back to ICARUS,

99
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:22,120
remember,
remember the doctor,

100
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,560
I mean he's the main character in that
chunk of in 2011,

101
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,620
he put out a study on oral to rentable.
He actually my understanding is dosed

102
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:38,191
himself and then studied the excretion
of his urine and what was coming out of

103
00:05:38,741 --> 00:05:43,540
it over the weeks and months after and
determined that there were multiple

104
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:48,541
maybe up to 50 metabolites that once
this Dah cmt was ingested into the body,

105
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,490
the body converted into other substances
and these metabolites stayed around.

106
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,490
He identified some short term,
some medium term metabolites and some

107
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:03,470
longterm metabolites,
specifically the m three that John's

108
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:07,040
tested positive for it.
So these longterm metabolites would

109
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,380
indicate that it was taken long time
ago.

110
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,760
They would stay around for the longest.
Why?

111
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,530
Why was he testing negative and then
testing positive for these extremely.

112
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:16,940
So yeah,
the numbers.

113
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,750
That's a good question and that's,
that's basically the question that

114
00:06:19,751 --> 00:06:22,280
point,
but what was not occurring and what has

115
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:27,281
never occurred in any of John Sampled is
any presence of the short and medium

116
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:33,821
term metabolites.
And if you look at a [inaudible] study,

117
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,000
he identifies a couple of these medium
term metabolites,

118
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:41,810
Roman numeral one and Roman numeral two.
And he says,

119
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:46,550
these metabolites based on his study
will stay in the body at least 22 days.

120
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,610
Well,
let's look back to the July seventh and

121
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:50,300
eighth.
You know,

122
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,170
positive tests.

123
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,840
He's negative on July seventh and eighth
for everything,

124
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:57,650
for the parent compound,
for the short term medium term

125
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:02,651
metabolites and the longterm metabolites
go 20,

126
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,900
21 days later.
So within that 22 day window,

127
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:09,110
which is study shows the short and
medium term metabolites would still be

128
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:13,880
showing up and there's no presence
whatsoever of the short or medium term

129
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:15,140
metabolites.
Now again,

130
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,350
we'll get into this a little bit more,
but I think the science,

131
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:23,180
what it's showing is a pulsing effect
for this longterm metabolite.

132
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,780
Meaning once you ingest,
whether intentionally or not

133
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:30,590
intentionally,
oral Terenna ball into the body,

134
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,370
the body breaks it down,
produces short term and medium term,

135
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,300
which is,
you know,

136
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,330
visible for a short and medium amount of
time.

137
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,990
And then this n three,
which is produced for a long period of

138
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:45,080
time,
I think with the issue appears to be,

139
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,890
and we'll get into this,
the UFC program is not the only program

140
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:49,520
that seen this.

141
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,240
There's another professional sports
league that has seen it very frequently.

142
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,940
You sat is also seen this on the Olympic
side,

143
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,980
but we're seeing this strange action
with the longterm and three metabolite

144
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:05,981
and the theory is it may be hiding in
the fat tissues surrounding organs and

145
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:11,510
maybe have a pulsing effect where it's
released at certain times and other

146
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:15,710
times you can't detect it and this is
not the actual substance itself,

147
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:18,620
but it's a metabolite correct.
Which indicates a reaction to this

148
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:22,710
substance and it indicates the body
breaking down the parent compound the,

149
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,550
the oral Terenna Ball,
and turning it into these other things

150
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:28,940
which are stored in the body.
So it's metabolites are not performance

151
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:32,900
enhancing drugs that are the result of
the breakdown of the parent drug in the

152
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:33,710
body.
Now,

153
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,380
what,
how much time is it detectable?

154
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:39,260
The actual drug itself?
So pretty quick,

155
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,970
uh,
it's a pretty quick clearance time.

156
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,000
I think we're Cenk off study says,
you know,

157
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,320
maybe a week,
uh,

158
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,720
so it's not around for very long and
that's why he conducted the study

159
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,280
ironically enough and I was going to go
watch vigorous here last night and I

160
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,500
just,
I've had too much going on in the last

161
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,140
week to kind of refresh mind,
but apparently he,

162
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,260
he knew this was part of his protocol
for Russian athletes.

163
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,280
He knew a coach that was still giving
the oral Terenna ball to Russian

164
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:07,560
athletes and he had a falling out with
the coach,

165
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,040
so he goes off on the side and studies,
Hey,

166
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,490
the parent compounds is going to get in
and out of the body pretty quick.

167
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,170
It's going to be difficult to detect
that.

168
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,410
Let's try to figure out what stays
around and leaves markers in the body

169
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:22,080
for a long time.
And so he developed these short and

170
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:26,940
longterm metabolite tests and was able
to catch some of these coaches athletes

171
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,300
for using the oral to rentable.

172
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,500
Interesting.
So the actual drug itself has gone from

173
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:33,450
the system,
but the metabolite remains.

174
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,050
Now,
what is the window that this metabolite

175
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:38,790
is supposed to be detectable in the
body?

176
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,400
Because we're talking now,
what are we at like 18 months?

177
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,920
So here's the show.
Here's the problem is that initial

178
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:46,830
ingestion,
because my question is these same

179
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:51,390
longterm metabolites,
these existed a year plus ago.

180
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,660
It was more than a year.
How long ago that,

181
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,950
that's the July 2017.
What was your initial test?

182
00:09:56,951 --> 00:09:59,280
So with all the experts,
and we'll get through this with all the

183
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:04,281
experts are telling us is there is no
evidence of reinjection and most likely

184
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:09,510
this is still remnants from the July
2017 tests,

185
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:12,470
however it was to enter into a system.
Um,

186
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,030
and we'll go through some of these
testing numbers that have shown

187
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,150
negatives followed by very low level
Pika.

188
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:23,450
Pika gram quantities question though,
was that the ingestion that happened

189
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:28,790
that he tested positive for in July of
2017 indicated a longterm effect,

190
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:29,160
right?

191
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,620
It was a long term chart metabolite,
correct.

192
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:34,350
So meaning it had already been an
assistant for a year,

193
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:36,610
so it absolutely could have predated,
you know,

194
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,440
the theory the first time through was
something had to have entered his system

195
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:44,790
between July seventh and July eighth.
Those negatives and this low pika gram

196
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,480
reading on July 28th.
Over this last year,

197
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,090
there's been a lot of study into this
longterm metabolite.

198
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:53,580
As I mentioned,
this isn't just a UFC issue.

199
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:57,360
There's another major professional
sports league that for the time being

200
00:10:57,361 --> 00:10:59,610
wants to keep their,
their testing confidential,

201
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:02,190
but they've shared that information with
scientists,

202
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:04,020
with Usada,
with myself.

203
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,460
They saw it on multiple occasions.
This pulsing effect over a year where

204
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:11,310
you'd see this positive test over a
year.

205
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,380
We're two and a half years now,
right.

206
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,230
If it's a year,
if it's a.

207
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,960
If in July,
July 2017 until you were talking a year

208
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:19,794
and a half,
right?

209
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,920
July 2017.
But it could have been an assistant a

210
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,640
year prior.
I don't know.

211
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,570
Yeah,
it could have been a couple months a

212
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,081
year.
I don't know.

213
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:30,570
He had never showed up for that end.
Three metabolite for.

214
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:34,470
He had been tested for it.
He had been tested multiple times in the

215
00:11:34,471 --> 00:11:37,140
programming from wrong isn't the same
level,

216
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,890
isn't it?
Approximately the same Pika grams that

217
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:45,891
exists today in 2018 that were there in
2017.

218
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,110
Generally if you look and we can go over
these numbers,

219
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:51,990
it,
it fluctuates from single digit and

220
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:55,090
never gets into triple digits to mid
double digits,

221
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:59,890
so there's some as low as nine Pika
grams over that time there was some at

222
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:03,580
60 pika grams per gram to someone who is
a preposterous.

223
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,890
It's insane.
And you know the.

224
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,750
The analogy that I heard early on was,
and I think John uses throw a pinch of

225
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:12,580
salt in Olympic swimming pool and I'm
like,

226
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:15,070
okay,
well that's kind of wrap your head

227
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:15,280
around.

228
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,250
Now let's go the other side.
Let's talk about something really small

229
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:22,120
that we know of and how many times you
have to break down that small particle

230
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,080
to get to a pika gram.
So one grain of salt and we all know

231
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:27,130
what that looks like.
Right?

232
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:31,420
You put that in front of you and you
split that and I'd mentioned this week,

233
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:33,910
$50 million.
It's actually 58 million.

234
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:36,880
If you split that 58 million times a
grain of salt.

235
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,650
Each one is a pika gram.
I mean it's incomprehensible the

236
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:45,430
detection level and how small that is.
It really is.

237
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,000
It's crazy.
And how many Pika grams did they find in

238
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,710
his system?
So he's gone from,

239
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,420
and I'll,
I'll read through it here.

240
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:55,300
So here's,
here's since the initial appearance of

241
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:59,020
the n three metabolite,
here's what John's tests look like and

242
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:02,830
those Pika gram reading.
So the first one was collection date was

243
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:05,140
July 28th,
2017.

244
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:09,340
He had a concentration of ADP programs.
Grams.

245
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,010
However,
let me caution and I'll read something

246
00:13:12,011 --> 00:13:14,380
from,
from an expert when you get down to

247
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:18,880
these pika levels.
And the science is somewhat inexact

248
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,420
because it's such a small amount.
So the variable,

249
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:24,040
the plus or minus,
you know,

250
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,350
can be anywhere from 20,
30.

251
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,820
I've seen in some instances 50 or 60.
So what this scientist name,

252
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:32,630
his name is Larry bowers.
Um,

253
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,710
he was formally the PSA,
the Usada Science director.

254
00:13:35,711 --> 00:13:40,711
He's currently retired and independently
consults before that he ran an Olympic

255
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,110
Olympic Committee,
a accredited laboratory at the

256
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,550
University of Indiana.
The guy's got 20 to 25 years of

257
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,600
anti-doping experience.
Here's what he,

258
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,650
he told me about,
uh,

259
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:54,723
you know,
when you're,

260
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,090
when you're analyzing small Pika gram
levels,

261
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,080
although the two respective laboratories
report a concentration,

262
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:08,250
I would caution against becoming too
fixated on the numbers.

263
00:14:08,251 --> 00:14:10,030
First,
the numbers are really estimates of

264
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:13,930
concentration and probably should be
considered a range of about plus or

265
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:16,000
minus 20 Pika grams per ml.

266
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,730
And he said the December ninth result
would be in the range of John's.

267
00:14:19,731 --> 00:14:22,780
So we'll get to that between 60 and
102nd.

268
00:14:22,781 --> 00:14:26,410
While the adjustment of concentration by
specific gravity attempts to deal with

269
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:28,570
the variability of urinary excretion
rates,

270
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,650
it is an exact,
it is inexact and adds variability to

271
00:14:32,651 --> 00:14:34,320
the estimates.
Finally,

272
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,060
most importantly,
science has no clear understanding of

273
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:41,360
the variance of urinary excretion of
drugs at ultra trace concentration.

274
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:43,000
So basically saying,
look,

275
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:45,820
I mean we have a general idea how this
works in science,

276
00:14:45,821 --> 00:14:49,000
but and I think in this instance comes
to play,

277
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,360
be real careful if you're going to be
the guy with the pseudoscience out there

278
00:14:53,361 --> 00:14:54,260
saying,
wait a second,

279
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:59,261
John jumped from 20 to 60 from September
to December and that means he readjusted

280
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,620
it.
What he's saying here is slow your roll

281
00:15:03,621 --> 00:15:04,241
on that.
That,

282
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:09,241
that it's such a small incomprehensible
level that we don't really know what

283
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,000
those variances are going to look like.

284
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,140
Now I think if we saw jumps and John
from single digit eight or nine Pika

285
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:18,110
gram to multiple hundred digit Pika
grams,

286
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,200
there would be a concern and maybe some
re administration,

287
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:25,460
but the experts I've speaking to when
you're talking variability of 10,

288
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:26,330
20,
30,

289
00:15:26,331 --> 00:15:28,970
40,
it's not that significant at the peak of

290
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:32,090
gram level,
what is the window where this longterm

291
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:35,720
metabolites starts to express itself?
Like what you said,

292
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:37,670
there's short term and there's medium
term.

293
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,830
This is the long term.
How long does it take for the law?

294
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,950
That's a good question.
I don't have the answer to that and may

295
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:48,050
be bank cubs report here and I would
encourage those that are home,

296
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,480
you know,
playing playing scientist at their

297
00:15:50,481 --> 00:15:51,860
computer,
a,

298
00:15:51,861 --> 00:15:55,280
the Journal of steroid biochemistry and
molecular biology,

299
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,080
a Rut,
chink of rights,

300
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:02,081
report detection and Mass Spec
spectrometric characterization of novel

301
00:16:03,141 --> 00:16:06,980
longterm to hydrochloric method,
testosterone metabolites in human urine.

302
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,590
I'm not sure when that longterm
metabolite,

303
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:12,350
how long it takes to to show up.
Here's the problem though,

304
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:15,350
with this substance.
He did a real brief study.

305
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,140
My understanding is administered it to
himself.

306
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:23,050
That's the only study that exists.
Oral Terenna Ball Dah,

307
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,350
cmt to my understanding is not approved
for use for human consumption

308
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,800
consumption anywhere,
anywhere in any country.

309
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:35,900
So you can't have clinical trials
ethically in the medical world because

310
00:16:35,901 --> 00:16:39,260
it's not legal to give this to human
beings.

311
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,970
So,
you know,

312
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,980
we're,
we're already kind of behind the eight

313
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:44,660
ball here and that,
you know,

314
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:48,110
as compared to other substances where
you can do clinical trials because

315
00:16:48,111 --> 00:16:51,110
they're readily available by
prescription or whatever.

316
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,610
The substance is not.
The substance was created by the East

317
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:59,060
Germans in the seventies and eighties.
And was part of their state sponsored

318
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,000
doping program,
or they were doping their athletes.

319
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,000
Can you correct me if I'm wrong,
but I believe what I've read is that

320
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:08,300
this is particularly effective when
people are cutting weight.

321
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:09,650
Yeah.
I mean,

322
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:12,770
is that true or is this just more.
I don't know about that.

323
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:16,630
I think some may be confusing Torenna
ball with oral Terenna ball.

324
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,100
Two completely different substances.
Actually.

325
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:20,210
Very important.
Yeah.

326
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,400
There's,
there's very different effects on the

327
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:24,560
body.
There's very different windows in terms

328
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:27,080
of detection time.
Explain that.

329
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,300
Yeah,
you gotta be really careful in this

330
00:17:29,301 --> 00:17:33,050
world of performance enhancing drugs.
There's names that are interchangeable.

331
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:34,320
There's different,
you know,

332
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,580
chemical names where you change a little
bit of that chemical name.

333
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:40,280
That could be me.
And a completely different substance.

334
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,950
There's instances where the chemical
name is different,

335
00:17:42,951 --> 00:17:46,850
but the substance is actually the same.
So when trying to compare two

336
00:17:46,851 --> 00:17:48,080
substances,
you know,

337
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,070
make sure if you're at home

338
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,260
doing that analysis,
you're comparing the right ones.

339
00:17:52,261 --> 00:17:55,830
Straight Terenna ball is different than
oral to rentable.

340
00:17:55,831 --> 00:17:57,300
What is the difference?
Uh,

341
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,560
yeah.
I can't tell you,

342
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:02,430
I'm not as familiar with Terenna ball
other than it's not oral to rentable,

343
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,590
so,
but there is a difference in terms of

344
00:18:04,591 --> 00:18:06,420
the detection window.
Yeah,

345
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:07,231
there would be,
I mean,

346
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:12,231
different substances create and throw
out different metabolites and different

347
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:14,480
substances have different detection
windows.

348
00:18:14,481 --> 00:18:18,150
So I haven't done my study and research
on straight to rent a ball other than

349
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:19,980
knowing it's different than the
substance here.

350
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:20,963
So,
uh,

351
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,150
Gregory Rich hank off,
that's how you say his last name,

352
00:18:23,151 --> 00:18:26,820
right?
He was the only guy to do an actual

353
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:28,440
verified study.
Correct.

354
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,080
Now has this study been,
is it been peer reviewed?

355
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:31,760
Yeah,
I mean it,

356
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,420
it's published in
the Journal of steroid biochemistry and

357
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:38,790
molecular biology.
So in order to get something published

358
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,050
it needs to be peer reviewed.

359
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:43,980
So it's hasn't been replicated anywhere.
Not that I'm aware of.

360
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:44,814
No.
So it's just.

361
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,950
So we have one study which is really
fascinating.

362
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,380
So we know that,
first of all,

363
00:18:49,381 --> 00:18:51,660
we know this is an effective steroid.
We know it works.

364
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,760
Yeah.
The East Germans I think showed that

365
00:18:53,761 --> 00:18:55,110
they wouldn't be a,
have been using it.

366
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,800
It's not a difficult,
it's not an easy,

367
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,000
easy substance to get ahold of.
Look,

368
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,060
when it's not approved for use anywhere
in the world,

369
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,610
um,
it's only available on the black market,

370
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,920
um,
so you'd probably have to go to China to

371
00:19:07,921 --> 00:19:12,490
get it manufactured or you know,
research chemical supply company that's

372
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,670
not supposed to be provided to,
to humans.

373
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,140
Now,
I'm certainly not attributing this to

374
00:19:16,141 --> 00:19:19,110
you,
but there were rumors.

375
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:24,111
This was one discussion.
Was that one of the possible ways he

376
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:26,150
could have ingested this?
Um,

377
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,600
and the speed very kind.

378
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,190
John Likes to party.
Okay.

379
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:31,740
One of the things about partying as
people do cocaine,

380
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,980
and one of the things about cocaine is
sometimes cocaine is cut with creatine.

381
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,790
One of the things about creatine is
oftentimes you're buying cheap creatine.

382
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,700
I spent like one of the things that
we've had with on it on,

383
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:44,190
it's our,
our products are all third party

384
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:46,680
verified,
but in the initial goings,

385
00:19:46,681 --> 00:19:50,100
when we tried different manufacturers,
especially for Alpha brain,

386
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:53,910
we found there were other trace elements
that were in Alpha brain that weren't

387
00:19:53,911 --> 00:19:56,490
supposed to be in there.
And it's because of the vats that they

388
00:19:56,491 --> 00:20:00,870
mix these things up with and one of the
things that we had heard was that

389
00:20:00,871 --> 00:20:05,871
creatine oftentimes is made in the same
place where they might be making oral

390
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,190
Terenna Ball,
they might be making antibody,

391
00:20:08,191 --> 00:20:11,580
they might be making a bunch of
different things and trace amounts of

392
00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:16,230
this stuff can get into the creatine and
they use creatine to cut cocaine with,

393
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,360
is this,
is this possible or am I just.

394
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,140
Yeah,
it's.

395
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,980
It's absolutely a theory.
I don't know.

396
00:20:20,981 --> 00:20:21,510
I,
I,

397
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:24,690
I can't sit here and say that happened,
but I will have heard similar things.

398
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,420
I have heard some more things.
I know for a fact,

399
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,990
based on my previous career,
I worked closely with the DEA.

400
00:20:30,991 --> 00:20:34,230
I was with the FDA.
I worked cases involving street

401
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:36,870
distribution of recreational drugs
including cocaine.

402
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:41,430
I know for a fact that creatine is one
of the most common substances that

403
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:45,720
cocaine is cut with because I look some
more color,

404
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,980
some more feel.
So getting back to

405
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,790
Mclaren's arbitration decision,
I mean this is publicly available

406
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:56,740
records so I'm not saying anything new
but it Mclaren addresses at least John's

407
00:20:56,741 --> 00:21:00,580
lifestyle around this time and he says
the athlete openly admitted to Usada

408
00:21:00,581 --> 00:21:04,600
that prior to and for a period of time
after the reporting of his second

409
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:08,140
adverse analytical finding on July 28,
2017,

410
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,310
the athlete used illicit so called
street drugs including cocaine.

411
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,950
Now for me to sit here and say that's
where it came from.

412
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:20,200
I don't know that he's talking about the
athlete admitted

413
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:26,110
that prior to and for a period of time
after the reporting of his second

414
00:21:26,111 --> 00:21:30,640
adverse analytical finding on July 27,
2017 admitted.

415
00:21:30,641 --> 00:21:35,050
So before that test and sometime after.
Okay.

416
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,380
So does that make sense though?
If it's cut,

417
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,360
that's what were the source of it is?
Does it make sense that that would show

418
00:21:43,361 --> 00:21:45,640
up as a longterm metabolite?

419
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:50,670
Doesn't it need a long time in the body
to digest or do we not know enough about

420
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:53,020
the window of time?
Yeah.

421
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:55,390
I don't know if we know enough about the
window of time.

422
00:21:55,391 --> 00:21:55,930
You know,
my,

423
00:21:55,930 --> 00:22:00,930
my theory and looking at it is even if
there's a small amount of the oral

424
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:05,380
Terenna ball in that it's going to for a
period of time,

425
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:10,120
show that parent compound at a small
picogram amount in the short and midterm

426
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,910
metabolites in the small Pika gram
amount.

427
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,600
We have never seen those in the history
of Johns testing.

428
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:21,400
It's only this longterm metabolite.
So that may be indication that it

429
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,860
occurred.
Maybe even prior to what we're talking

430
00:22:23,861 --> 00:22:27,700
about here.
Is it something that could be

431
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,790
accentuated in some way by the weight
cutting process?

432
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,340
I absolutely think that could be a
factor.

433
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,430
Um,
there are studies not necessarily with

434
00:22:36,431 --> 00:22:39,520
this,
but another substance clomiphene and

435
00:22:39,521 --> 00:22:40,110
look,
I want,

436
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:43,870
while I'm cautioning people to be
careful about comparing different

437
00:22:43,871 --> 00:22:47,380
substances,
the commonality between Clomiphene,

438
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,890
which there are multiple clinical
studies on because it is approved for

439
00:22:50,891 --> 00:22:55,891
use to be distributed to humans and oral
Terenna ball is they're both chlorinated

440
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,440
so they both contain a chlorine atom on
the molecule and there is a recently

441
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:06,900
published study on clomiphene and its
excretion rates again,

442
00:23:08,441 --> 00:23:10,060
for those at home that want to look it
up.

443
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,690
The study was published in the endocrine
society publication.

444
00:23:13,691 --> 00:23:18,010
It's pure reviewed.
The name of it is hpt axis effects and

445
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:21,490
urinary detection following clomiphene
administration and males.

446
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,470
So what they did is they basically,
you know,

447
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,500
got a group of males,
um,

448
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:31,000
gave them a one month cycle of
clomiphene,

449
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:34,450
you know,
I think 25 milligrams a day and then had

450
00:23:34,451 --> 00:23:39,451
them get off and then continue to look
at the urine up to 261 days after.

451
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,040
And what you saw and what you see in
this study is that pulsing effect.

452
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,270
So,
you know,

453
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,320
I'm looking at some of the study
subjects here.

454
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,200
Um,
subject one on day one,

455
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:56,201
21 still showed 147 Pika grams of
clomiphene day one,

456
00:23:56,361 --> 00:24:01,361
28 showed 174 pika grams.
Day One 35 shows nothing.

457
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,020
He's below the minimum courting a
reporting limit.

458
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,950
And then day one,
49 is back up to 2:36.

459
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,320
There are one,
two,

460
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,670
three,
four,

461
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:18,020
five,
six out of I think 12 subjects in that

462
00:24:18,021 --> 00:24:23,021
study that showed this pulsing effect of
this chlorinated substance coming and

463
00:24:23,601 --> 00:24:24,434
going.

464
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,410
Again,
you know,

465
00:24:25,411 --> 00:24:27,500
it's,
it's different than oral Terenna Ball,

466
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:32,150
but it has that common factor of being
chlorinated in this study.

467
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,920
They do talk about,
um,

468
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,120
a fat tissue called the,
let me look this up and make sure I got

469
00:24:38,121 --> 00:24:39,590
this right.
Adipose tissue,

470
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,890
this is fat that surrounds the internal
organs.

471
00:24:42,891 --> 00:24:45,710
It's one of the last things that the
body burns when it's going,

472
00:24:45,711 --> 00:24:47,570
you know,
starving itself and going to fat.

473
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:49,730
It protects those organs.
But yeah,

474
00:24:49,731 --> 00:24:51,750
you look at these,
you know,

475
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,400
extreme weight gains and cuts that the
UFC athlete goes through.

476
00:24:55,401 --> 00:24:59,750
I don't think you're going to find
possibly another human subject anywhere

477
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,850
that goes through putting weight on,
other than maybe that I don't think

478
00:25:04,851 --> 00:25:07,880
Olympic wrestling matches with an MMA
fighter,

479
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,230
um,
goes through,

480
00:25:09,231 --> 00:25:12,530
at least in my experience over these
three or four years talking to those in

481
00:25:12,531 --> 00:25:15,820
the Olympic world.
I think we're at the extreme and it's

482
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,630
something obviously we've talked about
before.

483
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,920
We're trying to curtail,
but you know,

484
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,610
there's,
there's clearly never been a study for

485
00:25:22,611 --> 00:25:27,320
anybody who dehydrates and readwrite
hydrates themselves to the extent that

486
00:25:27,321 --> 00:25:30,530
some of our athletes do.
You could never find that would never be

487
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:34,070
anybody with any ethics that would
support a study because some of that

488
00:25:34,071 --> 00:25:37,250
dehydration exceeds World Health
Organization standards.

489
00:25:37,251 --> 00:25:39,560
So there's no studies out there,
you know,

490
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,690
on this stuff.
But clearly,

491
00:25:41,691 --> 00:25:43,070
you know,
looking from afar I,

492
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:46,940
I'd say that it likely has some impact
over what's being released by this

493
00:25:46,941 --> 00:25:49,880
adipose tissue.
We should certainly talk about that in

494
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,950
the future,
about the week cutting aspect of it.

495
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:55,790
So the,
but this adipose tissue loss at extreme

496
00:25:55,791 --> 00:26:00,670
weight cuts could potentially be the
reason why this stuff is excreting

497
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,331
itself.
It's,

498
00:26:01,331 --> 00:26:04,070
it's definitely a theory out there.
What about microdosing?

499
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:09,550
So here's the thing with microdosing
microdosing has done with endogenous

500
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,120
substances,
so only test it.

501
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,880
Well,
I mean someone could try it with

502
00:26:13,881 --> 00:26:16,940
something else,
but the reason you microdose with

503
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:20,180
endogenous substances is there already
produced in the body.

504
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,800
Right?
So the theory of,

505
00:26:21,801 --> 00:26:24,200
okay,
I'm going to microdose oral terminable,

506
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,960
well,
oral terenna balls still producing these

507
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:30,920
short term and longterm metabolites in
theory,

508
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,980
whether you're taking 100 milligrams or
one milligram of oral Terenna Ball,

509
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,310
those excretion rates of those
metabolites are still going to be

510
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:42,140
consistent.
They're going to be in a much smaller,

511
00:26:42,141 --> 00:26:46,860
lesser a way to those excretion rates.
Is there a way to mask that in some way?

512
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,790
I'm not aware of any.
Go ahead.

513
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,380
I'm sorry.
The only study we have is Gregory,

514
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,620
correct?
That's it.

515
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,260
Correct.
But you know,

516
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:57,450
just taking it from a common sense
approach.

517
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,960
It's certainly those that know about
micro grossing,

518
00:27:00,961 --> 00:27:03,750
know that you microdose with indogenous
substances,

519
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:06,870
things that are already appearing in the
body so your body knows what to do with

520
00:27:06,871 --> 00:27:09,000
them,
knows what to do and you're fooling,

521
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,520
you know,
not only are these metabolizing and

522
00:27:11,521 --> 00:27:14,940
there's no metabolites of them,
but you could also be fooling the

523
00:27:14,941 --> 00:27:16,170
biological passport.

524
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,230
That's the concern I think and why
people microdose.

525
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:23,160
So you saw it as looking not only
testing for specific substances,

526
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:27,060
but our testosterone epitestosterone
ratio is going up.

527
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,930
They're looking at at blood values,
how many young red blood cells,

528
00:27:30,931 --> 00:27:34,470
how many mature red blood cells.
So microdosing and those two areas

529
00:27:34,471 --> 00:27:38,070
wouldn't set off alarms in the
biological passport world.

530
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,500
Um,
I've never heard personally of

531
00:27:40,501 --> 00:27:44,640
microdosing of exoticness substances
that are not found in the body

532
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,280
microdosing.
And my understanding is done with things

533
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:51,660
that are endogenous body for people that
are not familiar with this terminology,

534
00:27:51,661 --> 00:27:55,720
we're just talking about microdosing
performance enhancing drugs because a

535
00:27:55,820 --> 00:28:00,820
microdosing in today's world is a very
common thing with mushrooms and Lsd and

536
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:01,980
a lot of.
I mean,

537
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,330
I saw a ton of microdosing in the
cycling world that was tested for

538
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:09,180
testosterone epo,
Hgh,

539
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,040
all those natural occurring in the body.

540
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,360
And so they don't produce any really a
red flag metabolites if you do them at

541
00:28:17,191 --> 00:28:18,510
very,
very small levels,

542
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,940
they'll,
the parent will clear quickly not

543
00:28:20,941 --> 00:28:24,210
produce any metabolites and will not
throw off the biological passport

544
00:28:24,211 --> 00:28:25,710
analysis.
Um,

545
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,980
is there a,
what you mean when Victor Conte came out

546
00:28:28,981 --> 00:28:31,790
with a clear and all that stuff with
bulk?

547
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:34,470
Whoa.
They were fooling people.

548
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,363
Is it,
is it,

549
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,870
I mean,
one of the things we've talked about

550
00:28:36,871 --> 00:28:41,490
before is that it's a constant race to
try to keep up with more advanced

551
00:28:41,491 --> 00:28:43,140
cheaters.
It is.

552
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,730
And you know,
what's interesting in this,

553
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:46,620
I mean,
without to talk to you and maybe the

554
00:28:46,621 --> 00:28:48,600
first time we did talk a couple years
ago,

555
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,250
um,
it's come a long way from them,

556
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:52,590
but clearly if I've ever talked to you
15,

557
00:28:52,591 --> 00:28:55,170
16,
17 years ago when I got my start in the

558
00:28:55,171 --> 00:28:58,710
anti-doping world,
I would have told you definitively the

559
00:28:58,711 --> 00:29:01,830
testing is way behind what's being used
out there.

560
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,870
Um,
they were testing,

561
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:07,470
able to test to multiple nanogram
limits.

562
00:29:07,471 --> 00:29:11,520
That's as far down as we can go.
Now they can go down to single digit

563
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:13,980
Pika Gram.
There's another professional sports

564
00:29:13,981 --> 00:29:18,981
league out there that recently had a one
pika gram and three metabolite case.

565
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,790
I mean do the math coming down from,
you know,

566
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,330
four or five nanograms,
which used to be the lower limit now to

567
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:29,940
one Pika gram 10,000,
20,000 times.

568
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:35,030
I am almost under the theory that the
pendulum has swung maybe a little bit

569
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:39,990
too far in the other direction and that,
that certainly is part of my job to the

570
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:40,771
UFC.
Look,

571
00:29:40,771 --> 00:29:43,720
I want catch every intentional cheater
that's out there.

572
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:46,000
I want to make sure we have a rock solid
program.

573
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,940
Use all the latest and greatest,
you know,

574
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,950
um,
techniques to do it.

575
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:54,820
But I also want to keep an eye on it to
make sure it's being administrated

576
00:29:54,821 --> 00:29:55,654
fairly.

577
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,700
And when you're getting down to the
detection of one,

578
00:29:58,701 --> 00:30:00,610
you know,
single digit Pika grams.

579
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:05,530
I have a concern that what kind of level
of sensitivity we're talking about.

580
00:30:05,531 --> 00:30:10,000
Are we going to talk about environmental
contamination where you walk through a

581
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:13,240
room and somebody has just opened a
container of something and there's,

582
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,550
you know,
minuscule powders in the air.

583
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:19,720
There are documented cases that some of
the regularly prescribed prescription

584
00:30:19,721 --> 00:30:21,520
drugs,
specifically,

585
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:24,760
um,
diuretics are getting in water supplies

586
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,230
in some areas.
You know,

587
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:30,550
you get a lot of old people on them that
flush their old pills down the toilet.

588
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:34,870
There's documented cases of it getting
into the water supply and being

589
00:30:34,871 --> 00:30:39,070
detectable at that peak of gram level.
So you've got to be really,

590
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:40,930
really careful about that.
And I think,

591
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,620
you know,
this case exemplifies that you saw it

592
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:49,650
and really the world antidoping agency
world and community are aware of that.

593
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:51,101
Um,
you know,

594
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:55,290
with greater sensitivity and testing in
my opinion because you know,

595
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,600
makes greater responsibility to be
objective and look fairly at what really

596
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:03,220
we're doing here when we're detecting in
that small amount.

597
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:07,900
But this,
this test of John's where he's testing

598
00:31:07,901 --> 00:31:12,901
for the same level of peak of grams
today as he was in July of 2017.

599
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,380
Is it safe to say that this is
unprecedented?

600
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:23,200
Repeat that again,
that John's test for the same levels of

601
00:31:23,201 --> 00:31:28,201
peak grams of these metabolites in 2018
that he was testing for in 2017 with

602
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,570
this is unprecedented.
No,

603
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,630
the answer's no,
so maybe unprecedented in the UFC

604
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:37,660
program,
but what the United States anti-doping

605
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:42,040
hhc did over these last five or six
months as they reached out to the

606
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:44,980
science community outside the scope of
the UFC,

607
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,040
they reached out to other professional
sports organizations.

608
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:52,090
They reached out to other to
laboratories and what they were seeing

609
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:57,390
was multiple instances of this pulsing
effect where over time you would see a

610
00:31:58,031 --> 00:31:58,864
reading.

611
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:03,010
The next test it would go away and the
next time you'd see that reading again

612
00:32:03,011 --> 00:32:06,970
maybe back up to or even above this much
time was correct.

613
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,830
Yes.
So you see that in the.

614
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,280
In the clomiphene study here too,
I mean almost 260.

615
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:15,370
They stopped the study,
what it was still appearing and Pika

616
00:32:15,371 --> 00:32:20,371
gram levels in some subjects and they
stopped the study at 261 days and you

617
00:32:20,621 --> 00:32:23,260
see those numbers.
I was reading to you see this one

618
00:32:23,261 --> 00:32:27,310
subject at one 74,
he's negative the next time and then he

619
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:29,770
pops up to two in the two hundreds
after.

620
00:32:29,771 --> 00:32:32,380
So it's actually more than the time
before.

621
00:32:32,381 --> 00:32:33,790
Again,
apples and oranges,

622
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:37,000
different substances.
But the commonality here is chlorinated

623
00:32:37,001 --> 00:32:40,880
substance.
So is it safe to say that this is an

624
00:32:40,881 --> 00:32:45,881
emerging science and that we're still
learning and understanding this as we go

625
00:32:47,181 --> 00:32:48,350
along?
Absolutely.

626
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,640
It,
it's still very young.

627
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,570
Look,
the first,

628
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,930
you know,
the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles were

629
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:57,650
the established the first drug testing
laboratory by Dr Catlin.

630
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,540
Um,
so really,

631
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:01,820
you know,
in the scope of science going back to

632
00:33:01,821 --> 00:33:04,130
the earliest days,
then they're talking about,

633
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,023
you know,
what,

634
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,800
30,
30 years,

635
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,210
30,
35 years.

636
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,740
Um,
again,

637
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:12,260
when I started off in this 16 or 17
years,

638
00:33:12,261 --> 00:33:15,580
the science still wasn't good.
They were unable to detect anything in

639
00:33:15,581 --> 00:33:17,210
the Pika gram level.
Um,

640
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,610
again,
for,

641
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,420
for reference.
Very interesting.

642
00:33:20,421 --> 00:33:24,260
So the water,
the world anti-doping agencies accredits

643
00:33:24,261 --> 00:33:28,640
laboratories across the world and they
have certain standards that those

644
00:33:28,641 --> 00:33:32,870
laboratories must meet or to retain that
accreditation.

645
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,020
Um,
and keep that accreditation so they have

646
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:40,130
a technical document called the minimum
required performance levels of their

647
00:33:40,131 --> 00:33:42,440
laboratories.
So would they tell the laboratories as

648
00:33:42,441 --> 00:33:46,190
you must detect these substances down to
this amount?

649
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,290
If you can't get them down to this
amount,

650
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:50,750
then you can't have an accreditation
from water.

651
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:56,210
So the class of substances that oral
Terenna ball would be in,

652
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:01,460
um,
which would be other anabolic agents,

653
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:06,820
the required minimum level that they
must detect two is only two nanograms.

654
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,830
So look,
why did he even says,

655
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:13,160
as long as you can get to two nanograms,
you can retain our accreditation.

656
00:34:13,161 --> 00:34:14,960
Well,
what's happening is an arms race in

657
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:16,880
these laboratories.
They're saying,

658
00:34:16,881 --> 00:34:17,630
well,
the twos,

659
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:21,410
the minimum standard,
but I can get down further and you know,

660
00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:24,950
these are private entities that are
looking for,

661
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,930
for customers.
So to be able to reach out and say,

662
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:30,320
well even the law tells us to is as low
as we need to go.

663
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:34,640
We can go down to one pika gram.
I think in a sense,

664
00:34:34,641 --> 00:34:36,740
maybe you need to slow the reigns on
that a little bit.

665
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:41,330
That we're getting too far and too
sensitive of a level of detection when

666
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:46,331
it comes to implementing a fair program
because you can't determine where a pika

667
00:34:47,091 --> 00:34:48,230
gram ca came from.

668
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,750
You could be breathing again,
contaminated air,

669
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,440
drinking contaminated water.
It gets real dangerous when you get down

670
00:34:54,441 --> 00:34:57,830
that low.
The how does this reflect on past

671
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,660
suspensions?
This is what when you deal with someone,

672
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,770
look,
let's bring up Frank Mir for example.

673
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:07,230
Didn't Frank Mir also test for oral turn
a ball.

674
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:08,840
Okay.
I want to get back to Frank Mir,

675
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:11,630
but let's.
Let's go back to John and this instance

676
00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:13,580
and why you saw that has come out and
said,

677
00:35:13,581 --> 00:35:15,830
look,
this is not a violation.

678
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,310
So if you go to the water,
the world anti-doping code,

679
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:22,430
there's a section 10 point seven,
point four,

680
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:27,460
point one are UFC program basically
mirrors that and we're bringing that up

681
00:35:28,971 --> 00:35:32,450
on the screen there.
So for purposes of imposing sanctions

682
00:35:32,451 --> 00:35:35,690
under tab 10,
point seven and anti doping rule

683
00:35:35,691 --> 00:35:38,010
violation will only be a second

684
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,980
violation.
If the anti-doping organization can

685
00:35:40,981 --> 00:35:44,730
establish the athlete or other person
committed the second anti-doping rule

686
00:35:44,731 --> 00:35:48,810
violation after the athlete or other
person received notice pursuant to

687
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:52,110
article seven,
etc. This is what's known as a double

688
00:35:52,111 --> 00:35:56,160
jeopardy clause.
Be sancTion guy tests positive for

689
00:35:56,161 --> 00:36:00,510
something and if he's test positive for
the exact same substance that is still

690
00:36:00,511 --> 00:36:03,960
in his system a year later or whatever
the amount of time is,

691
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,540
you don't include that as a new positive
test.

692
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:09,780
One more thing has to happen.
Science has to determine that there

693
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:14,670
hasn't been a real administration so
test positive for the same substance and

694
00:36:14,671 --> 00:36:17,310
science says,
based on all the numbers we see,

695
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,850
there's no evidence of any readminister
ration and the non evidence of the

696
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:27,020
administration is the lack of short term
and medium term can go and never ever.

697
00:36:27,841 --> 00:36:32,380
And john cyran issue though that this is
only one test that gregory would cenk

698
00:36:32,381 --> 00:36:37,381
[inaudible] test is the only study that
showed that these medium and short term

699
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,510
metabolites exist.

700
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,840
It it's the only study,
but I think then if there's only one

701
00:36:42,841 --> 00:36:45,000
study,
you have to go to anecdotal evidence.

702
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:49,170
Right.
Do studies on ufc employees because

703
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:55,380
they'll do it.
Oral to rentable is illegal to

704
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:58,920
distribute.
Go in any country throughout the world.

705
00:36:58,921 --> 00:37:01,320
It's really legal.
Contracts go.

706
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:02,580
They just let you do whatever you want
to do.

707
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,290
I don't know,
maybe we can look into that,

708
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:07,380
but shelby maybe up for that.
That's the reason for living there.

709
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,440
Um,
I,

710
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,330
I,
I,

711
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:13,470
I have a problem with that in that we're
relying on one study.

712
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,580
This seems to me to be like a critical
thing that could affect.

713
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,170
I mean we're,
we're,

714
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,710
we're hoping and we're,
uh,

715
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:25,050
we're putting faith in this study that
this is the only way that these

716
00:37:25,051 --> 00:37:28,650
metabolites express themselves.
Is it possiBle that,

717
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,260
what,
that,

718
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:33,480
theSe,
like you see what the pulsing effect

719
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:38,010
that you see positive effects and
negative or positive results and

720
00:37:38,011 --> 00:37:42,930
negative results that these short term
and medium term metabolites don't always

721
00:37:42,931 --> 00:37:46,950
express themselves and that what we're
considering a longterm metabolite could

722
00:37:46,951 --> 00:37:48,780
in fact just be a metabolite.

723
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,570
Yeah.
I mean I guess it's possible,

724
00:37:51,571 --> 00:37:53,520
but what do you,
are you going to sanction an athlete

725
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,820
again because you know,
potentially it's possible.

726
00:37:56,821 --> 00:37:59,400
And then the theory of the universe,
you can't do that.

727
00:37:59,401 --> 00:38:03,660
Let me read to you real quick what,
what these experts came out at in terms

728
00:38:03,661 --> 00:38:08,661
of administration.
So Dr. Daniel eichner runs the salt lake

729
00:38:08,701 --> 00:38:10,710
city.
It's called a smart sports medicine

730
00:38:10,711 --> 00:38:12,900
research testing laboratory,
or myrdal.

731
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:16,320
They're one of two water accredited
laboratories in the United States.

732
00:38:16,321 --> 00:38:18,570
You have the one being at ucla,
um,

733
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,030
again,
one of the most respected minds in

734
00:38:21,031 --> 00:38:23,490
anti-doping phd,
chemist,

735
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:28,920
I'm his answer in terms of readminister
ration.

736
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,390
Um,
was this.

737
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:35,080
And you very rarely see scientists at
his level talk in a absolute in

738
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,190
absolutes.
There you go.

739
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:41,110
And here he says,
there is no evidence that dah cmt has

740
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:43,690
been readministered that's in writing to
us.

741
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:46,550
So very definitive on that.
Um,

742
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:50,530
you sought as science director.
Now danny daniels independent even of

743
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:52,060
usada.
So those who criticize,

744
00:38:52,061 --> 00:38:54,280
hey,
you saw it as in bed with the ufc.

745
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:58,390
Daniel lackner doesn't work for usada.
He runs an independent laboratory.

746
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,960
Usada send samples there.
The nfl send samples,

747
00:39:01,961 --> 00:39:04,440
they're major league baseball,
send samples there.

748
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,670
The ncaa,
he's independent,

749
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,550
owns his own laboratory.
Um,

750
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:14,050
usada also put out a letter to us in,
in writing,

751
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,050
um,
upon careful consideration of the very

752
00:39:17,051 --> 00:39:22,051
low concentration of the dh cmt longterm
metabolite and Mr. Jones is sample and

753
00:39:22,181 --> 00:39:25,750
taking into account the human pharma
kinetic characteristics of this

754
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:28,170
particular longterm anabolic steroid
metabolites,

755
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,760
uh,
based on data to which you saw it has

756
00:39:30,761 --> 00:39:34,540
access to and in consult,
in consultation with scientific experts,

757
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:38,950
some of whose opinions are enclosed,
you sought as concluded consistent with

758
00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:40,630
prior residual amounts detected.

759
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:45,630
And Mr. Jones sample that the presence
of dh cmt longterm metabolite is

760
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:50,761
consistent with residual amounts from
exposure prior to July 28th,

761
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,070
2017.
I'm,

762
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:54,980
look,
I'm,

763
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,220
I'm not an expert.
I don't profess to be,

764
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:59,950
um,
my background's in finance and

765
00:39:59,951 --> 00:40:02,200
accounting.
I traced the money back in the old days,

766
00:40:02,201 --> 00:40:06,940
but I know who those experts are out
there in the world and these are them.

767
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,670
Um,
they're my putting these things in

768
00:40:09,671 --> 00:40:11,860
writing,
putting their reputations on the line

769
00:40:11,861 --> 00:40:14,470
now and forever going forward.
Um,

770
00:40:14,471 --> 00:40:17,140
they're never going to do something like
that because you know,

771
00:40:17,141 --> 00:40:22,141
the ufc pays you saw to administer our
program or because jon jones is a

772
00:40:22,181 --> 00:40:24,760
popular fighter and they want to see him
fight this weekend.

773
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:27,460
That's just not the way this world
works.

774
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:29,650
Of course in in fact,
it works the opposite way.

775
00:40:29,651 --> 00:40:31,870
There would be a great benefit if they
could catch him cheating.

776
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:32,823
Absolutely.

777
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:36,640
And you know,
historically experts like this are very,

778
00:40:36,641 --> 00:40:40,360
very conservative when it comes to
talking in absolutes like this.

779
00:40:40,361 --> 00:40:43,090
They don't normally do it.
In all fairness.

780
00:40:43,091 --> 00:40:48,091
The real question is guys like you and
me because we are ufc employees so we

781
00:40:48,131 --> 00:40:50,470
can handle this fairly and get that
argument,

782
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:53,320
you know,
and I saw that left and right that hey,

783
00:40:53,321 --> 00:40:56,390
jeff and joe are paid by the ufc.
Of course they're going to come out in

784
00:40:56,391 --> 00:40:57,430
this way,
but look,

785
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,640
all these things that I'm reciting today
ever do that in regards to cheating,

786
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,140
I wouldn't either.
I've,

787
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,540
I side with the ufc and a lot of things
because I support the sport and I want

788
00:41:05,541 --> 00:41:09,220
it to excel.
I don't side ever with cheating.

789
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:14,310
If I think that there's some way somehow
that someone is given an unfair

790
00:41:14,531 --> 00:41:16,810
advantage and this is somehow being
covered up,

791
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,460
I would rather not work for them.

792
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,060
Joe,
my,

793
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,390
my seventh,
my last 17 years of my career,

794
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:23,500
my,
my,

795
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,400
my,
you know,

796
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:28,090
everything that I've worked for is to
protect the rights of clean athletes and

797
00:41:28,091 --> 00:41:32,410
to eradicate cheating from the sport.
I can't tell you how strongly I feel

798
00:41:32,411 --> 00:41:34,940
about that given me everything in my
life.

799
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,220
My dad was a high school basketball
coach,

800
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:40,730
um,
it paid for my college and scholarships.

801
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,601
It,
you know,

802
00:41:41,601 --> 00:41:46,130
at least the good characteristics in me
I can all trace directly to sports and

803
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,310
entering into the equation the issues of
breaking the rules,

804
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:52,340
the issues of the health and safety
aspects when you have young.

805
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:56,990
And I talked to many parents whose kids
use steroids because they saw the

806
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:00,860
professional athletes doing.
Entering that into the body when your

807
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:03,410
hormonal levels are already out of
control is very,

808
00:42:03,411 --> 00:42:05,570
very dangerous.
Both short and longterm.

809
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:09,320
Can't tell you how passionate I am about
this issue.

810
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:14,120
And those out there that are saying that
I'm corrupt and my reputation is out the

811
00:42:14,121 --> 00:42:17,230
window,
I would never ever in a million years

812
00:42:17,231 --> 00:42:20,300
listening to those people.
I mean you obviously you have,

813
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:25,360
but you can't listen to those people
because they want to find things wrong.

814
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,820
I'm.
One of the things that I've said about

815
00:42:28,821 --> 00:42:30,920
you is you're a guy who loves to catch
people cheating.

816
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,630
You like it,
you enjoy it.

817
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,920
That's not true,
man.

818
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:36,530
You do.
I don't mind if someone is cheating and

819
00:42:36,531 --> 00:42:37,580
you catch them.
well,

820
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,610
you know,
in the ufc program now with what we've

821
00:42:40,611 --> 00:42:42,860
established here.
Absolutely.

822
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:44,810
Back in the old days,
and we've talked about this.

823
00:42:44,811 --> 00:42:47,660
Look when you had in baseball or in
cycling,

824
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:51,470
no testing going on.
Literally the Organizations were looking

825
00:42:51,471 --> 00:42:53,390
in the other direction.
I've often said that,

826
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:54,980
look,
I don't agree with what they did,

827
00:42:54,981 --> 00:42:58,820
but there's a portion of me and that's
why I think a lot of these athletes

828
00:42:58,821 --> 00:43:00,730
respected me and share that information.

829
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:04,190
There's a portion of me that said,
I don't agree with what you did.

830
00:43:04,191 --> 00:43:06,080
I'd like to think I wouldn't make the
sand decision,

831
00:43:06,081 --> 00:43:08,240
but I damn well understand why you did
this.

832
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:10,940
You're fighting for millions of dollars
in contracts,

833
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,740
you know,
your teammates are doing it,

834
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:15,530
you know,
your competitors are doing it and you

835
00:43:15,531 --> 00:43:17,540
know,
you're professional sports organization

836
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:21,290
doesn't give a shit because of the
weakness of the testing program or total

837
00:43:21,291 --> 00:43:22,124
lack there.
Uh,

838
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,170
So in instances like that,
there was,

839
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,510
I never came away saying that guy's an
idiot or an asshole for choose.

840
00:43:27,511 --> 00:43:30,380
And I came away saying,
kinda get why he did it.

841
00:43:30,381 --> 00:43:32,750
If I was 21 or 22 years old and
immature,

842
00:43:32,751 --> 00:43:37,430
I may have made the same decision.
Now come into our program here where you

843
00:43:37,431 --> 00:43:39,830
have an organization that cares very
much,

844
00:43:39,831 --> 00:43:44,831
that spends multimillion dollars a year.
This program has done nothing but costs.

845
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:49,840
The ufc money costs us money and how we
implement the program costs us money on

846
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:53,870
canceling fights.
Anybody who thinks moving this fight to

847
00:43:53,871 --> 00:43:57,860
California is that a financial benefit
to the ufc is crazy.

848
00:43:57,861 --> 00:44:01,580
We're taking a bath on this one.
People really do need to understand that

849
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:06,590
the ufc decided themselves.
They self imposed usada as say,

850
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,240
sanctioning of fights.
Correct.

851
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,070
Nobody forced us to do that,
so this is a.

852
00:44:10,071 --> 00:44:14,840
This was a big step in the right
direction of trying to make the sport

853
00:44:14,841 --> 00:44:17,570
cleaner because we recognize that first
of all,

854
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,800
there was some legal stuff with the
testosterone replacement therapy that

855
00:44:20,801 --> 00:44:22,970
just threw everything out of whack right
where it was.

856
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,600
Essentially it was sanctioned.
Cheating.

857
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,520
I mean,
let's be honest about what that was.

858
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,440
it was.
It was clearly a my understanding being

859
00:44:30,441 --> 00:44:31,850
manipulated.
Yes,

860
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,310
very easy to manipulate when you get
permission to use any prohibited

861
00:44:35,311 --> 00:44:36,150
substance like that.

862
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:41,330
And we went from that to unbelievably
strict protocols and now what you're

863
00:44:42,061 --> 00:44:44,520
seeing is you're seeing,
first of all,

864
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:49,380
we saw a radical change in the physiques
have some fighters where we did have

865
00:44:49,381 --> 00:44:53,100
some suspicions and those suspicions,
at least in my eyes had been confirmed

866
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:58,640
and now we're seeing the good side of
this with what in your estimation might

867
00:45:01,711 --> 00:45:05,400
have been moved over into a position
where,

868
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,890
okay,
now now it's getting a little bit

869
00:45:07,891 --> 00:45:12,510
ridiculous in terms of like what we can
detect and what is what is causing

870
00:45:12,511 --> 00:45:14,610
fights to be cancelled.
Exactly.

871
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:18,500
So interestingly enough,
the world antidoping agency or water,

872
00:45:18,501 --> 00:45:23,100
they're next code revision is 2021.
And so they regularly put out,

873
00:45:23,101 --> 00:45:25,320
hey,
what are the issues going forward that

874
00:45:25,321 --> 00:45:28,320
we want to address?
And one of the major issues is

875
00:45:28,321 --> 00:45:33,321
potentially establishing thresholds for
these low level substances that keep

876
00:45:34,651 --> 00:45:35,484
appearing.

877
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,340
Um,
dah cmt being one of them,

878
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:42,980
austrian being one of them.
And so the idea that water is looking at

879
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:46,020
and has a working group of worldwide
experts is,

880
00:45:46,021 --> 00:45:48,000
hey,
if if something that gets reported back

881
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:52,290
at under 50 pika grams,
all the evidence is showing,

882
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,320
more likely than not,
this is from a very low level

883
00:45:55,321 --> 00:45:58,790
contaminant issue.
We've never seen an issue of microdosing

884
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,960
or an intentional use that's reached
that level.

885
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:06,290
Why are the labs even reporting at sub
at quantities lower than 50 pika grams

886
00:46:07,351 --> 00:46:09,750
or 100 peak grams?
I think very soon they're going to come

887
00:46:09,751 --> 00:46:14,580
out with a recommendation.
We are going to adopt that before 2021.

888
00:46:14,581 --> 00:46:17,790
Once that working group and we're in
communication with them,

889
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,540
comes up with those recommendations.
You'll see it implemented first in the

890
00:46:21,541 --> 00:46:22,890
ufc program.
Again,

891
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:28,130
I've always said fairness,
due process in a program is just as

892
00:46:28,531 --> 00:46:30,390
important as the strength and
comprehension,

893
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:32,310
comprehensiveness of that program.

894
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:36,570
You'll lose faith in your athletes.
You could have the strongest loophole

895
00:46:36,571 --> 00:46:40,440
free program in the world,
but you start implement ting things

896
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,770
unfairly.
You'll lose faith just as much as if you

897
00:46:43,771 --> 00:46:45,300
had a bunch of loopholes and the
program.

898
00:46:45,301 --> 00:46:49,450
It's got to be fair.
Are you aware of the female skier that

899
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:52,110
tested positive because of lip balm?
Uh,

900
00:46:52,111 --> 00:46:53,040
I think,
yeah,

901
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:56,310
it's vaguely recall about that.
What was someone else use the lip balm

902
00:46:56,311 --> 00:46:57,510
before her?
No,

903
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:58,081
no,
no,

904
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:59,040
no.
It was a,

905
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:00,990
uh,
a lip balm for sunburn.

906
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:06,620
It was for sunburnt lips and it had some
ridiculously small trace amount.

907
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:12,030
Was it austrian cve?
Her name is jo jo burg.

908
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:15,660
Trying to remember her name.
Well,

909
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:18,510
there was the,
the cocaine kissing defense was actually

910
00:47:18,511 --> 00:47:20,640
won an arbitration.
So something similar.

911
00:47:20,641 --> 00:47:23,820
Somebody tested positive for,
you know,

912
00:47:23,821 --> 00:47:26,760
low level metabolites of cocaine and
basically said,

913
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:27,301
look,
you know,

914
00:47:27,301 --> 00:47:28,590
hey,
whether that was good or not,

915
00:47:28,591 --> 00:47:30,300
but um,
you know,

916
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:32,070
the arbitrator bought it and the science
shows,

917
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:32,490
hey,
that,

918
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:35,380
that is a possibility.
The detection levels are so low.

919
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:39,220
If you kiss somebody who had just done
cocaine,

920
00:47:39,221 --> 00:47:41,440
they are now able to detect at those
levels,

921
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:45,130
in the person that kiss that person.
That makes sense.

922
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:49,000
Do you find this woman doping label on
the label?

923
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:51,030
Which is why they gave her a penalty
apparently.

924
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:51,893
Oh,
I see.

925
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:53,620
Okay.
What is the,

926
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:56,200
um,
who fucks reading labels on lip balms?

927
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:57,940
You know what I mean?
See,

928
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,220
that's how crazy it's gotten.
I mean,

929
00:48:00,221 --> 00:48:03,610
all our athletes know when,
when they're using a creatine or a

930
00:48:03,611 --> 00:48:06,220
protein or whatever,
I think most of them are pretty careful

931
00:48:06,221 --> 00:48:08,110
right now,
but to tell them,

932
00:48:08,111 --> 00:48:10,060
hey,
you need to read your lip balm and your

933
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:11,170
deodorant.

934
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:11,980
I mean,
where,

935
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:15,760
what level of we get into here?
And these levels of detection.

936
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,590
So she 29 year old star of norway's
powerhouse squad of skiing,

937
00:48:20,591 --> 00:48:23,650
cross country skiing,
tested positive for an anabolic agent

938
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:26,080
listed in the contents of a treatment
for sunburn.

939
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,510
Um,
this could be similar in some ways to

940
00:48:31,511 --> 00:48:34,900
what Chad mendez tested positive for,
for something for psoriasis,

941
00:48:34,901 --> 00:48:37,810
correct.
Sat Chad mendez has obvious psoriasis.

942
00:48:37,811 --> 00:48:40,780
You'd see it on his body.
He's talked about it pretty openly and

943
00:48:40,781 --> 00:48:44,200
you use some sort of a cream and
accepted his penalty.

944
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:46,180
Wasn't aware that this cream had
something,

945
00:48:46,181 --> 00:48:48,400
some type of a steroid into it.
Yeah,

946
00:48:48,401 --> 00:48:52,690
I had seen him publicly state that now
he chose not to present a defense or go

947
00:48:52,691 --> 00:48:55,690
to arbitration.
So I haven't seen anything in detail to

948
00:48:55,691 --> 00:48:58,030
review.
He just wrote knowledgeable opinion on

949
00:48:58,031 --> 00:48:58,421
that.
Yeah,

950
00:48:58,421 --> 00:48:59,300
he did.
Um,

951
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,120
what.

952
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:04,030
So let's get back to the frank mir case.
Frank mir tested positive.

953
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:07,820
Was it also also same thing,
longterm metabolite of world to

954
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,460
rentable.
here's the difference.

955
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:14,700
Frank mir the same as John Jones.
His first time through was sanctioned.

956
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,150
John didn't get off the first time they
showed up in his system.

957
00:49:19,151 --> 00:49:19,931
He got,
you know,

958
00:49:19,931 --> 00:49:23,020
he was looking at potential for years,
went to arbitration,

959
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,340
presented evidence,
enacted some other clauses in the policy

960
00:49:27,341 --> 00:49:29,950
that reduced his sanction.
What does that mean?

961
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:33,880
Well,
one of them was a substantial assistance

962
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:37,810
where he assisted usada in some way,
shape or form,

963
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:39,820
and he got a reduction for,
for doing that.

964
00:49:39,821 --> 00:49:42,160
Assisted in what way?
So I don't know,

965
00:49:42,161 --> 00:49:44,830
and this is the exact reason why I do
this.

966
00:49:44,831 --> 00:49:49,690
So I insulate myself from that
interaction between usada and the

967
00:49:49,691 --> 00:49:50,960
athlete.
They are the sole,

968
00:49:50,961 --> 00:49:52,570
a dirty jew,
decatur in this.

969
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,820
They do not,
you know,

970
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,200
get me on the phone,
say,

971
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,610
hey,
we're thinking about going this way.

972
00:49:57,611 --> 00:50:00,170
They adjudicate completely in a vacuum
and you are,

973
00:50:00,171 --> 00:50:04,660
you're just so people know your title is
safety,

974
00:50:04,661 --> 00:50:06,700
health and safety,
athlete health and performance.

975
00:50:06,701 --> 00:50:08,590
Vice president of athlete health and
performance.

976
00:50:08,591 --> 00:50:11,320
Yeah.
So you no longer work for you saw?

977
00:50:11,321 --> 00:50:12,710
I've never worked for usada.
That's,

978
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:15,070
that's a big misconception.
A lot of our fighters think that I've

979
00:50:15,071 --> 00:50:18,580
never worked for it.
I was a federal agent for 22 and a half

980
00:50:18,581 --> 00:50:21,850
years.
I'm the latter part of my career and got

981
00:50:21,851 --> 00:50:25,360
involved with all these ped distribution
cases.

982
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:30,840
Two thousand 15 fertitta and dana white
through a mutual friend contacted me and

983
00:50:31,371 --> 00:50:31,611
said,
hey,

984
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:33,710
would you come out and kind of talk to
us?

985
00:50:33,711 --> 00:50:36,350
We're contemplating maybe putting our
own program together.

986
00:50:36,351 --> 00:50:39,050
We've had some recent high profile
positive,

987
00:50:39,051 --> 00:50:43,550
so I came out to vegas a talk with them
and a week later I get a phone call

988
00:50:43,551 --> 00:50:47,000
asking if I want to come work for him
and kind of implement this new program,

989
00:50:47,001 --> 00:50:49,730
but I've never been an employee of
usada.

990
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:50,623
OkAy.
So that's.

991
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:54,200
That's good to know because that's been
stated by some public figures that you

992
00:50:54,201 --> 00:50:56,990
used to work for usada and now you work
for the ufc.

993
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,460
Shale was one of my favorite words.
Um,

994
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,820
so you never worked for usada you,
uh,

995
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:09,740
brought usada to the ufc or communicated
with usada and facilitated this

996
00:51:09,741 --> 00:51:11,210
agreement?
Correct.

997
00:51:11,211 --> 00:51:13,330
So I,
I'd never worked for you sada.

998
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:17,450
I did work very closely with usada.
So you saw that when I first started

999
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:20,200
these series of investigations back in
2002.

1000
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:23,210
Look,
I knew all about how to work a heroin

1001
00:51:23,211 --> 00:51:26,300
distribution organization and cocaine
distribution organization,

1002
00:51:26,301 --> 00:51:29,180
methamphetamine,
but when it came to performance

1003
00:51:29,181 --> 00:51:32,600
enhancing drugs,
there was no class that myself or really

1004
00:51:32,601 --> 00:51:35,960
any other federal agent or law
enforcement agent goes through

1005
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,110
surrounding distribution of performance
enhancing drugs.

1006
00:51:39,111 --> 00:51:44,111
So I was examining the discarded garbage
of balco every week when they put it out

1007
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:47,840
to the curb,
began seeing notes,

1008
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:49,490
rappers,
all these substances.

1009
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:52,970
I had no idea what these things were.
I didn't know the difference between

1010
00:51:52,971 --> 00:51:55,310
testosterone,
epitestosterone,

1011
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,230
erythropoietin,
hgh.

1012
00:51:57,231 --> 00:52:00,950
I knew nothing.
So what I did is I figured out who those

1013
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,650
experts were,
who were the people that could very

1014
00:52:03,651 --> 00:52:06,080
quickly get me up to speed on what I was
looking at.

1015
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:07,940
Um,
dr catlin,

1016
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:11,450
who ran the ucl olympic loud one of the
first and he started,

1017
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:12,561
um,
you know,

1018
00:52:12,561 --> 00:52:16,100
kind of walking me through this,
he put me in touch with usada and you

1019
00:52:16,101 --> 00:52:18,110
know,
they began educating me as well.

1020
00:52:18,111 --> 00:52:19,430
So,
um,

1021
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:22,580
over the course of those investigations,
um,

1022
00:52:22,581 --> 00:52:25,850
I got a lot from them in terms of
educating on these substances.

1023
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:29,510
They were bringing some of their
cooperating witnesses to me and then we

1024
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:33,470
go off and running on criminal
investigations but never,

1025
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,860
never worked for them.
So you sought to correct me if I'm

1026
00:52:36,861 --> 00:52:39,350
wrong,
but the way they would work would be

1027
00:52:39,351 --> 00:52:40,810
very compartmentalized.

1028
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:44,750
Like they would not specifically
communicate with you on all of the

1029
00:52:44,751 --> 00:52:46,310
details of this.
Correct.

1030
00:52:46,311 --> 00:52:49,640
And they don't.
Now pendants aspect,

1031
00:52:49,641 --> 00:52:52,460
I don't as these deliberations are going
on,

1032
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:54,800
what they're looking at,
I don't know.

1033
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,180
It's cooperation.
Just for me to be frank would in my

1034
00:52:59,181 --> 00:53:01,610
eyes,
would mean that something was done

1035
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:06,170
purposely illegally and this person had
some knowledge of purpose,

1036
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:08,630
purposeful,
illegal aCtivity,

1037
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:13,810
and that they would somehow communicate
this to facilitate some sort of catching

1038
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:17,900
of someone involved in a criminal act or
an act of cheating.

1039
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,510
Yeah,
that would make sense to me too.

1040
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,770
He said that would be what we were
talking about.

1041
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:26,810
Usada would allow john a shorter if he
actively participated in helping them

1042
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,050
catch people that were cheating,
that that's the understanding.

1043
00:53:31,051 --> 00:53:33,080
I don't know.
Implied implied.

1044
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:34,830
I don't know to what level that was
done.

1045
00:53:34,831 --> 00:53:37,200
I don't know if it was that or if it
was,

1046
00:53:37,201 --> 00:53:39,750
hey,
here's how this drug works.

1047
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:41,040
In more general.
Here's.

1048
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:44,670
I don't know what it was.
I purposely that would mean that john

1049
00:53:44,671 --> 00:53:47,610
would have to know about cheating.
If you were saying like this,

1050
00:53:47,611 --> 00:53:50,100
this is how this drug works.
This is how I used it.

1051
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:53,820
I mean this would he would.
That would mean his initial defense

1052
00:53:53,821 --> 00:53:55,770
would have to be thrown out the window
because it wasn't an accident.

1053
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,521
Well,
I mean,

1054
00:53:56,521 --> 00:53:59,250
I don't know about that.
If you knew something separate from,

1055
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:01,650
you know,
that he wasn't someone else.

1056
00:54:01,651 --> 00:54:02,401
Yeah.
And again,

1057
00:54:02,401 --> 00:54:04,380
I don't,
I don't want anybody to reach that

1058
00:54:04,381 --> 00:54:07,710
conclusion.
I have no idea what his substantial

1059
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:09,480
assistance entailed.
None.

1060
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,520
Um,
and that's a slippery slope.

1061
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:15,960
It is a slippery slope and look,
transparency's important in any program,

1062
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:18,990
but you know,
only to a certain level.

1063
00:54:18,991 --> 00:54:21,030
Look,
if you are transparent about what

1064
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:22,420
everyone's,
you know,

1065
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,610
cooperation or substantial assistant was
and the whole world knew about it,

1066
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:29,740
you're never going to get anybody after
that coming in and,

1067
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:30,990
and,
and cooperating.

1068
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:34,890
I saw this definitely on the criminal
side with informants.

1069
00:54:34,891 --> 00:54:37,410
You don't,
that's not something that's that you

1070
00:54:37,411 --> 00:54:39,390
want to be transparent about or
disclose.

1071
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,580
Right.
But there's going to be a bunch of

1072
00:54:41,581 --> 00:54:44,640
people that have a real issue with that.
The idea that jon jones,

1073
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:47,180
you know,
one of the greatest fighters of all time

1074
00:54:47,181 --> 00:54:49,690
is actually working as an informant.
I mean it's,

1075
00:54:49,691 --> 00:54:51,090
it's listed in the,
in the,

1076
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:53,070
you know,
in the mclaren's ruling that that was

1077
00:54:53,071 --> 00:54:56,520
one of the reasons for the mitigating
factor in the reduction.

1078
00:54:56,521 --> 00:54:57,480
But I don't,
again,

1079
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,870
joe,
I know to leave that alone.

1080
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,400
Nothing about it.
It's been stated.

1081
00:55:02,401 --> 00:55:03,390
We know what it is.
Okay.

1082
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,710
Or what we know that it's a thing.
Um,

1083
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:10,820
when it comes to the john's initial test
where he was sanctioned and was

1084
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,200
suspended for a determined period of
time.

1085
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:21,210
Frank mir also was sanctioned and was
for a determined period of time as well.

1086
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,490
He was two years.
He was.

1087
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:25,950
John was shorter than that.
John was shorter and cooperate on a

1088
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,450
bunch of other to fail.
So you,

1089
00:55:27,451 --> 00:55:28,710
you,
you not only cooperative,

1090
00:55:28,711 --> 00:55:30,870
he went to arbitration and put on a
defense.

1091
00:55:30,871 --> 00:55:32,400
He put on a defense that,
look,

1092
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:35,880
the evidence here shows no intentional
ingestion of it,

1093
00:55:35,881 --> 00:55:40,110
and in fact that claire and gave him a
further reduction based on.

1094
00:55:40,111 --> 00:55:42,870
There was no evidence of this was
intentionally done.

1095
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:46,500
Frank mir didn't put on any.
He had every right to go to arbitration

1096
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,990
put on his own offense.
Didn't do that.

1097
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:51,660
What about josh barnett?
Josh barnett,

1098
00:55:51,661 --> 00:55:53,460
you know,
a completely different set of facts.

1099
00:55:53,461 --> 00:55:57,840
His came from a contaminated supplement.
It was a different substance.

1100
00:55:58,170 --> 00:56:02,520
He went to an arbitration hearing.
The arbitrator ruled with josh and said,

1101
00:56:02,521 --> 00:56:03,241
yep,
you know,

1102
00:56:03,241 --> 00:56:08,190
based on where we are now based on the
care and effort that you took your

1103
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:11,400
right,
you deserve to earn to have time served

1104
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:12,810
at the time of that arbitration.

1105
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,000
So again,
I think that's a good example of the

1106
00:56:15,001 --> 00:56:19,230
checks and balances in place here.
You've got me overseeing the program,

1107
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,360
taking a look at how these things come
out.

1108
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:26,690
You've got the ability from the to go to
mclaren's group and judge,

1109
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,000
you know,
the set of facts.

1110
00:56:28,001 --> 00:56:30,280
And in that case mclaren's group said
usada,

1111
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:35,420
I think maybe overreached a little bit
here and I believe josh and josh is,

1112
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:37,420
you know,
basically time served.

1113
00:56:37,421 --> 00:56:39,310
So you know,
you'd want to see,

1114
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,250
you want to see them get it perfect
right every time.

1115
00:56:42,251 --> 00:56:44,470
But you know,
and the reality and the real world is

1116
00:56:44,471 --> 00:56:47,110
that doesn't necessarily happen and
that's why you have these checks and

1117
00:56:47,111 --> 00:56:50,240
balances available.
I'm josh barnett.

1118
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:52,720
Take on.
The matter is that they tried to paint

1119
00:56:52,721 --> 00:56:55,810
him as guilty even though he was not in
that he,

1120
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:00,840
he feels like he definitely got a bad
deal and that he was labeled as someone

1121
00:57:01,091 --> 00:57:02,830
who is taking this substance.

1122
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,010
He was suspended for a long period of
time while he was going through this and

1123
00:57:06,011 --> 00:57:11,011
although he was found not guilty that he
feels like not enough emphasis was put

1124
00:57:13,091 --> 00:57:16,870
into establishing that he was not guilty
and that he,

1125
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:20,380
he feels like they chased him down over
something that you didn't do.

1126
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:21,251
Yeah,
I mean,

1127
00:57:21,251 --> 00:57:21,601
well,
well,

1128
00:57:21,601 --> 00:57:25,630
here's what he did do is he used a
supplement that if he would have

1129
00:57:25,631 --> 00:57:29,380
listened to anything that we educate on
that you saw to sends out regular

1130
00:57:29,381 --> 00:57:34,381
reminders are fighters are required on a
quarterly basis to go through videos and

1131
00:57:34,541 --> 00:57:37,210
their whereabouts,
filing that deals with these issues.

1132
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:40,660
If he would have followed any of that
advice when it came to his supplement

1133
00:57:40,661 --> 00:57:42,790
choices,
you would have never chosen the

1134
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:44,170
supplement he used.
I,

1135
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:45,131
you know,
when,

1136
00:57:45,131 --> 00:57:48,220
when I heard about that supplement and
what was on the label and how it was

1137
00:57:48,221 --> 00:57:49,690
marketed,
I said,

1138
00:57:49,691 --> 00:57:50,350
okay,
well that's,

1139
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:52,630
that's likely the candidate of where it
came from.

1140
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:54,850
So I mean,
the analysis would be,

1141
00:57:54,851 --> 00:57:55,684
hey,
you know,

1142
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:58,840
that pool will be careful.
There's sharks swimming in that pool.

1143
00:57:58,841 --> 00:58:02,380
They can eat you and the person jumps in
the water anyway saying like,

1144
00:58:02,381 --> 00:58:05,560
I didn't want to get eaten by a shark,
but shark comes up and ate them.

1145
00:58:05,561 --> 00:58:06,730
It's like,
hey,

1146
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,310
we told you that this was the case.
You didn't follow that.

1147
00:58:09,311 --> 00:58:13,420
Now there also needs to be a
differentiation between someone who's

1148
00:58:13,421 --> 00:58:15,340
intentional cheating,
intentionally cheating,

1149
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,280
and someone that's just,
you know,

1150
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:22,300
makes a naive supplement choice there,
there needs to be a differentiation

1151
00:58:22,301 --> 00:58:23,320
between that.
And there was,

1152
00:58:23,321 --> 00:58:24,940
in that case,
josh didn't get,

1153
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:27,520
you know,
the full penalty of what was,

1154
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:31,960
what that substance would have rendered.
But he did have to go through a long

1155
00:58:31,961 --> 00:58:33,850
period of time where he was unable to
fight.

1156
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:35,261
He did.
But,

1157
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:36,041
you know,
again,

1158
00:58:36,041 --> 00:58:38,620
he had the prohibited substance in his
body.

1159
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,140
Um,
as you saw it,

1160
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:41,200
it has to look at,
hey,

1161
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:43,630
even though you did that,
didn't do that on purpose,

1162
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,180
did that give you a performance
enhancing benefit?

1163
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:48,190
Did it allow you to recover a little bit
better?

1164
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:51,280
Did it make you a little bit stronger?
And you know,

1165
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:54,160
that's why those strict liability
provisions are in there.

1166
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:56,980
Otherwise people would just take these
prohibited supplements and say,

1167
00:58:56,981 --> 00:58:58,680
oh,
I didn't know exactly it was just

1168
00:58:58,690 --> 00:58:59,700
accident.
Exactly.

1169
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:00,940
Meanwhile,
they're getting a benefit for.

1170
00:59:00,941 --> 00:59:03,190
Exactly.
So they have to have some sort of

1171
00:59:03,191 --> 00:59:04,990
penalty in place.
I think so.

1172
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,940
Now I also think,
again,

1173
00:59:06,941 --> 00:59:11,200
there needs to be a differentiation
between the intentional not intentional.

1174
00:59:11,201 --> 00:59:15,670
And we do have that in our policy.
There are definitely mitigating factors

1175
00:59:15,671 --> 00:59:18,310
available in our policy that if you
didn't do things on purpose,

1176
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,410
you're not,
you're not sanctioned as hi.

1177
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:21,950
Tim means is a great example there.

1178
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:25,320
So tim means used a relatively benign
supplement.

1179
00:59:25,321 --> 00:59:27,470
It was a creatine,
creatine,

1180
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:30,470
you know,
generally doesn't have an issue as,

1181
00:59:30,471 --> 00:59:32,690
as,
as opposed like testosterone booster

1182
00:59:32,691 --> 00:59:35,510
supplements.
We tell our athletes stay away from

1183
00:59:35,511 --> 00:59:38,310
anything marketing as a testosterone
booster.

1184
00:59:38,311 --> 00:59:41,840
It's one of the most common with
contaminants are purposefully spiking

1185
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:45,470
purposeful spikings to means use a
creatine.

1186
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:49,100
It had a austrian and in a very small
amount,

1187
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:52,020
uh,
we found it in their australian is the

1188
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:54,350
two year sanction.
He got six months,

1189
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:55,860
um,
you know,

1190
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:58,880
so back relatively quickly.
So I think that's the thing with yoel

1191
00:59:58,881 --> 01:00:03,260
romero so correct.
Yoel romero used a natural diuretic

1192
01:00:03,261 --> 01:00:08,030
product that had a psalm in it.
I'm in all these cases,

1193
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:13,420
not only does the prohibited substance
need to show up and what the athlete has

1194
01:00:13,491 --> 01:00:17,480
says they've used our ready to eat,
but to protect against making sure the

1195
01:00:17,481 --> 01:00:21,350
athlete isn't purposely spiking it,
you saddle will go out on their own,

1196
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:24,110
on the market,
independently procure,

1197
01:00:24,111 --> 01:00:25,880
hopefully the same lot of product.

1198
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,300
And in the case of joelle and tim,
they were able to do that,

1199
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:31,700
test it completely independently of the
athlete,

1200
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,880
determine what level of the prohibited
substances in that,

1201
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:38,060
based on the interview with the athlete
of how much did you use,

1202
01:00:38,061 --> 01:00:40,940
when's the last time you used it
relative to this test,

1203
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:44,990
do the science calculations just to make
sure an athlete's not saying,

1204
01:00:44,991 --> 01:00:49,010
well I know this creatine is spiked with
australian so I'm going to go use

1205
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:52,880
austrian and then I have a built in
excuse when I test positive for

1206
01:00:52,881 --> 01:00:56,660
australian in order to be able to match
contaminant levels with what's being

1207
01:00:56,661 --> 01:01:00,320
excreted in the urine.
You would literally have to have phd

1208
01:01:00,321 --> 01:01:03,650
chemistry degree and I'm not aware of of
any of our athletes have in that.

1209
01:01:03,651 --> 01:01:05,450
It'd be very,
very difficult to do that.

1210
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:07,250
And so these detection levels,
again,

1211
01:01:07,251 --> 01:01:08,810
we're talking about nana grams.

1212
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:12,500
We're not talking about large quantities
that would work pika grams grams.

1213
01:01:12,501 --> 01:01:13,334
Okay.
Correct.

1214
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:17,990
Now what,
why was,

1215
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:24,280
why was this moved from vegas to
California and why?

1216
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,440
Why did the California state athletic
commission,

1217
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,710
why did they accept this fight taking
place here?

1218
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:35,920
And why did vegas say no to it?
So internally the ufc wise,

1219
01:01:36,171 --> 01:01:38,000
we first,
in fact donna marcaine,

1220
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:40,880
who you know who works with me,
a shout out to donna.

1221
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:44,150
Exactly.
We're a two person shop and the woman's

1222
01:01:44,151 --> 01:01:45,830
a hawks and one of the hardest workers I
know.

1223
01:01:45,831 --> 01:01:47,480
So she's.
She's awesome.

1224
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:51,230
She's taken a look at something that we
have access to called the clearinghouse

1225
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:55,730
and it's basically a recording of all
the tests on our athletes so we can get

1226
01:01:55,731 --> 01:01:56,960
on there.
Somebody says,

1227
01:01:56,961 --> 01:01:58,970
hey,
how many times was john tested last

1228
01:01:58,971 --> 01:02:01,700
quarter?
We can get on there and pull that up.

1229
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:04,880
The public also has access to our
testing records,

1230
01:02:04,881 --> 01:02:07,500
not with a specificity that the
clearinghouse has,

1231
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:11,390
but the public can get on and you saw it
on a weekly basis.

1232
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,080
Updates how many tests and athletes
done.

1233
01:02:15,081 --> 01:02:17,810
So there's some of these,
some guys out there on the internet from

1234
01:02:17,811 --> 01:02:21,870
the day one of the program have kept
track of what week they're numbers tick

1235
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:25,200
up so you can go find spreadsheets on
the internet at least from a,

1236
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:27,960
from a weekly basis of when our athletes
were tested.

1237
01:02:27,961 --> 01:02:30,420
Now many times every week,
god bless those dorks.

1238
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:31,283
Crazy,
huh?

1239
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:35,430
So the clearinghouse program is very
specific.

1240
01:02:35,431 --> 01:02:39,210
We can get on there and see the actual
date of the collection and next to that

1241
01:02:39,211 --> 01:02:42,540
we see negative,
positive or pending.

1242
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,200
So donna came to me late november,
early december saying,

1243
01:02:46,201 --> 01:02:48,780
hey,
I'm looking at john's tests and I'm

1244
01:02:48,781 --> 01:02:53,340
seeing pending still back from,
it was maybe august,

1245
01:02:53,341 --> 01:02:56,310
september.
I think something's going on here.

1246
01:02:56,311 --> 01:02:57,480
And of course I'm like,
okay,

1247
01:02:57,481 --> 01:02:59,550
well he's fighting pretty soon.
I hope not,

1248
01:02:59,551 --> 01:03:01,740
but let me reach out to you sada.

1249
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,750
So I reached out to them.
They said,

1250
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:07,380
we're working on something,
we're conducting a study,

1251
01:03:07,381 --> 01:03:09,240
we're talking to other professional
sports leagues,

1252
01:03:09,241 --> 01:03:13,080
we're talking to the laboratories out
there and don't have an answer for you

1253
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:14,340
now that,
but stand by.

1254
01:03:14,341 --> 01:03:19,341
So I think it was a december six.
They sent a letter to us and they sent a

1255
01:03:20,431 --> 01:03:23,610
letter to the Nevada state athletic
commission saying,

1256
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:27,090
just so you're aware,
over the last six months,

1257
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:29,070
um,
early in this six months,

1258
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:34,071
we've seen a reemergence of this
longterm metabolite in john's samples.

1259
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:37,350
We lost was this.
So this was early december,

1260
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:38,900
December 6th,
um,

1261
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:41,520
we and the Nevada athletic commission
were notified.

1262
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:44,250
You were notified,
but the test was from previous.

1263
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,230
Just so the tests,
these tests,

1264
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:51,350
I'm covered from august through
november.

1265
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:55,110
Okay.
So there's white test.

1266
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:56,340
Several of them.
Oh,

1267
01:03:56,341 --> 01:03:59,220
so more than one test showed this
metabolite.

1268
01:03:59,221 --> 01:04:04,080
So what they said was August 9th,
negative August 29th,

1269
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:07,230
eight pika grams,
September 18th,

1270
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:09,390
eight,
eight September 18th.

1271
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:10,920
So I mean there's a,
there's a good.

1272
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:14,850
So he's negative on the ninth,
20 days later.

1273
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,940
So inside the 22 two checkups,
22 day window,

1274
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:21,930
he shows an eight pika gram,
no short term metabolites,

1275
01:04:21,931 --> 01:04:23,700
no longterm,
no parent,

1276
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,380
no medium term,
no medium.

1277
01:04:25,381 --> 01:04:26,960
I'm sorry.
No medium and longterm.

1278
01:04:26,970 --> 01:04:28,220
Thank you.
Um,

1279
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:32,520
we then go to the 18th of September,
19 pika grams.

1280
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:35,820
And then that's followed by four
negative tests,

1281
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:39,690
September 21st october,
second,

1282
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:43,860
October 11th and November 14th.
So at this point,

1283
01:04:44,310 --> 01:04:45,960
late november,
early december,

1284
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:47,610
you saw it says,
okay,

1285
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:51,660
we've done our studying those two low
levels in august,

1286
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:55,130
our residual,
there's no evidence of any real

1287
01:04:55,131 --> 01:04:58,080
administration based on lack of short
and medium term.

1288
01:04:58,081 --> 01:05:02,430
And parent based on our consultation
with other leagues with these labs that

1289
01:05:02,431 --> 01:05:04,590
are seeing this,
we're calling this,

1290
01:05:04,591 --> 01:05:06,990
this is would be double jeopardy if we
did them again.

1291
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:09,360
Okay.
So this is something that should be

1292
01:05:09,361 --> 01:05:12,060
really emphasized because there's a lot
of people that don't understand this.

1293
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:16,770
This is not just this one test.
These are many tasks that have been done

1294
01:05:16,771 --> 01:05:21,160
over the course of john suspension and
then ultimately relicensing that are

1295
01:05:21,161 --> 01:05:26,161
showing this exact same metabolite at a
very similar level that according to

1296
01:05:26,891 --> 01:05:29,860
previous tests,
specifically on clomiphene,

1297
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:34,890
that this could be this pulsing correct
result of existing and not existing.

1298
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:40,590
But this is not indicative in any way
that can be provable of microdosing.

1299
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:43,270
Correct.
And not only that,

1300
01:05:43,271 --> 01:05:46,720
but this is over.
We're talking about this being over long

1301
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:48,820
term,
long periods of time.

1302
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:50,070
Many months,
yes.

1303
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:53,140
Okay.
And consistent numbers over many months.

1304
01:05:53,141 --> 01:05:54,160
Yes.
So,

1305
01:05:54,161 --> 01:05:57,540
and again,
going back to what one expert Dr. Bauer

1306
01:05:57,541 --> 01:05:58,900
said,
you've got to be careful what you're

1307
01:05:58,901 --> 01:06:02,110
talking about.
Single double number rams.

1308
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:04,270
And you see some variance.
You got to be careful about saying,

1309
01:06:04,271 --> 01:06:07,630
well it went from nine to 18.
That means real administration,

1310
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:10,630
no,
it's inexact science at that level.

1311
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:13,690
The water labs,
this is a non threshold substance,

1312
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:17,770
so all his water requires them to say,
to report back to water,

1313
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:21,460
positive or negative.
They're not required to quantify.

1314
01:06:21,790 --> 01:06:23,140
However,
these water labs,

1315
01:06:23,141 --> 01:06:26,620
I've also realized there's an issue when
you're getting under pika grams.

1316
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:30,760
So what they're doing is going back
after reporting the positive,

1317
01:06:30,761 --> 01:06:32,590
hey,
let's see if we can estimate with this

1318
01:06:32,591 --> 01:06:37,540
level is it's an inexact science at pika
gram quantities and my understanding,

1319
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,750
um,
to estimate what those levels are.

1320
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:42,520
Okay.
You can see some variations.

1321
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:47,550
So Nevada is unwilling to sanction the
fight based on all this information.

1322
01:06:49,871 --> 01:06:52,750
So they get,
they get the initial notice that we got.

1323
01:06:52,751 --> 01:06:55,030
Also,
I think it was december six saying,

1324
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:57,070
look,
there was an issue in,

1325
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:59,380
in august these longterm metabolites
reappeared.

1326
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:02,440
Appeared again.
But we've since had four negative tests.

1327
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:05,070
We don't believe that the august,
you know,

1328
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,420
reappearance is a re administration.

1329
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:09,700
There's no sanction here.
Nevada,

1330
01:07:09,701 --> 01:07:12,310
you don't even have jurisdiction over
the august test.

1331
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:14,380
Again,
keep in mind these are ufc tests.

1332
01:07:14,381 --> 01:07:16,870
Nevada doesn't mandate it,
but Nevada says,

1333
01:07:16,871 --> 01:07:19,390
look closer to a fight.
We do take jurisdiction.

1334
01:07:19,391 --> 01:07:24,391
We will adopt these usada tests.
So you saw it didn't need to to notify.

1335
01:07:24,431 --> 01:07:26,290
They thought out of an abundance of
caution,

1336
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:29,230
let's let Nevada know that this issue
exists.

1337
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:32,110
Goddamn usada what they said,
but wait,

1338
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:34,750
that's all good.
And you saw that it gets this.

1339
01:07:34,990 --> 01:07:35,890
I talked with them.
They're like,

1340
01:07:35,891 --> 01:07:36,790
whoa,
this is,

1341
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:39,460
this is concerning,
but we don't see anything within our

1342
01:07:39,461 --> 01:07:43,780
jurisdiction here.
So I certainly hope that no subsequent

1343
01:07:43,781 --> 01:07:46,810
tests show up positive because that
could be an issue.

1344
01:07:46,811 --> 01:07:51,070
And sure enough you saw to collect a
sample from john on 12,

1345
01:07:51,071 --> 01:07:53,710
nine,
they expedited the results because they

1346
01:07:53,711 --> 01:07:57,850
knew the fight was coming up and they do
that now when fights or clothes or the

1347
01:07:57,851 --> 01:08:00,490
collections are done close to a fight
and here,

1348
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:03,040
you know,
he pulses back up to uh,

1349
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:05,830
you know,
between 60 and 80 pika grams.

1350
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:08,360
So Nevada gets this.
Uh,

1351
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:09,510
this was last week,
man,

1352
01:08:09,530 --> 01:08:12,040
the days of run together for me.
So,

1353
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:13,630
uh,
a week ago,

1354
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:17,630
friday we have in a bob bennett who's
the executive director.

1355
01:08:17,690 --> 01:08:20,900
While I'm a big fan of these great guys
talked shit about Nevada,

1356
01:08:20,901 --> 01:08:23,820
but I remember fbi agent so we gotten a
ton of ground.

1357
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:27,230
He is.
He's one of the reasons why it probably

1358
01:08:27,231 --> 01:08:29,750
wasn't sanctioned in Nevada was because
they're so by the book.

1359
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:32,000
I get angry because I wanted to fight to
be in Nevada,

1360
01:08:32,001 --> 01:08:35,650
but I understand bob's position that
implicitly so.

1361
01:08:35,651 --> 01:08:37,940
So let me make clear what happened.
Bob came in,

1362
01:08:37,941 --> 01:08:40,790
Anthony Martin elle,
the chairman of the commission came in

1363
01:08:40,791 --> 01:08:44,090
and a couple representatives from the
vat attorney general's office.

1364
01:08:44,091 --> 01:08:49,091
So they are the ones that prosecute and
cases involving ped use at violates

1365
01:08:49,971 --> 01:08:54,010
Nevada regs.
So we share all this with them and list

1366
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:54,853
like you did with me.

1367
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:57,200
Correct.
Share it all with them and look,

1368
01:08:57,201 --> 01:09:01,220
there's some misconception out there.
They did not say this fight absolutely

1369
01:09:01,221 --> 01:09:03,590
not happening next week.
In fact,

1370
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:06,620
they,
I think we're understanding these

1371
01:09:06,621 --> 01:09:07,730
issues,
but said,

1372
01:09:07,731 --> 01:09:08,630
look,
you know,

1373
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:13,400
optically,
this doesn't look great and we feel that

1374
01:09:13,401 --> 01:09:17,840
out of an abundance of caution that we
need to have a public hearing and be

1375
01:09:17,841 --> 01:09:20,780
very transparent about this because this
is.

1376
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:23,690
This is some weird shit.
Um,

1377
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:26,720
this was last friday,
so we're eight days out from the fight,

1378
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:27,520
so,
you know,

1379
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,640
we start talking about,
hey,

1380
01:09:28,641 --> 01:09:33,641
when can we potentially have this?
And unfortunately christmas holiday,

1381
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:38,750
several of the commissioners weren't
even in town and basically what they

1382
01:09:38,751 --> 01:09:39,590
said is,
look,

1383
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:42,290
we will absolutely do this if you want
us to,

1384
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:45,470
but likely that hearing would not be
until tuesday,

1385
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:47,510
thursday or maybe tomorrow,
friday.

1386
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,850
And you know,
marinello is like,

1387
01:09:49,851 --> 01:09:50,480
look,
I,

1388
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,760
I,
I'm starting to get my head around this,

1389
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:57,440
but I can't guarantee you that my other
commissioners or me are going to come

1390
01:09:57,441 --> 01:09:58,190
out the same way.

1391
01:09:58,190 --> 01:10:01,150
So you're taking,
you're taking a chance here that,

1392
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:02,390
that we could say,
well,

1393
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:04,350
we need more information.
So.

1394
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:07,700
So basically they were willing to listen
to it.

1395
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:10,310
Um,
I think they were starting to wrap their

1396
01:10:10,311 --> 01:10:14,270
heads around it but didn't feel that
they were up to speed enough on it.

1397
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:17,540
Um,
they didn't have the luxury that andy

1398
01:10:17,541 --> 01:10:21,740
foster and California have.
Remember when john tested positive in

1399
01:10:21,741 --> 01:10:23,150
July,
2018,

1400
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:27,860
that fight was in California because
that fight was in California,

1401
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:32,270
California retained jurisdiction.
They've had two very public hearings on

1402
01:10:32,271 --> 01:10:36,620
john when they suspended his license and
most recently a week and a half ago when

1403
01:10:36,621 --> 01:10:40,220
they reinstated his license.
So andy in the commission,

1404
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:43,340
we're very familiar with the world
termina ball.

1405
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:48,440
They were very familiar with the
longterm metabolite and in fact andy was

1406
01:10:48,441 --> 01:10:51,590
somewhat critical of usada during the
last hearing.

1407
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:55,370
He thought after looking at all the
details after reading,

1408
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,610
you know,
mclaren's a position that there was no

1409
01:10:58,611 --> 01:11:00,860
evidence that this was done on purpose.

1410
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:01,941
He thought,
man,

1411
01:11:01,941 --> 01:11:05,000
maybe they went a little bit hard on him
and he stated that in that,

1412
01:11:05,001 --> 01:11:10,001
in that second hearing.
So with the reemergence of the pika gram

1413
01:11:10,191 --> 01:11:14,490
quantity of this m three longterm
metabolite andy in the commission,

1414
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:17,730
unlike Nevada,
didn't need to get up to speed on it.

1415
01:11:17,731 --> 01:11:20,940
They've already had two public hearings
on john's issue.

1416
01:11:21,150 --> 01:11:26,150
They were intimately familiar with some
of these dynamics of this drug and the

1417
01:11:26,371 --> 01:11:29,610
metabolites and,
and that's why he felt comfortable based

1418
01:11:29,611 --> 01:11:34,611
on their familiarization with it and
based on these written absolute

1419
01:11:34,801 --> 01:11:38,580
statements by these experts.
So there was no real ingestion one.

1420
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:42,150
And then the second thing which we
haven't covered is these experts said,

1421
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:45,810
based on these low level pika grams,
there's no performance enhancing

1422
01:11:45,811 --> 01:11:49,770
benefit.
And that's an important point because if

1423
01:11:49,771 --> 01:11:54,771
you would've told you fc look,
this is still remnants from a year and a

1424
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:57,570
half ago,
but we can't rule out that he's not

1425
01:11:57,571 --> 01:11:59,880
getting a performance enhancing benefit
from it.

1426
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:01,950
Well,
in that instance I'll tell you,

1427
01:12:01,951 --> 01:12:03,080
and you know,
I,

1428
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:06,240
I stand by this I,
w I would leave this company if somebody

1429
01:12:06,241 --> 01:12:09,180
told me otherwise,
if there was any indication that there

1430
01:12:09,181 --> 01:12:11,970
would be a benefit from him,
even though it technically wasn't a

1431
01:12:11,971 --> 01:12:15,240
violation,
I'm not going to stand by while anybody

1432
01:12:15,241 --> 01:12:18,150
licenses that guy to fight could have
been.

1433
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:23,240
Could this have been somehow or another
mitigated by communicating these results

1434
01:12:25,531 --> 01:12:28,140
to Nevada earlier?
Well,

1435
01:12:28,141 --> 01:12:32,730
we didn't announce the fight that john
was going to fight and in Nevada until

1436
01:12:32,790 --> 01:12:34,920
october,
but in october.

1437
01:12:34,921 --> 01:12:36,720
So you have said,
hey look,

1438
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:38,070
here's this issue.
Sure.

1439
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:41,550
Potentially.
But the issue was you saw that hadn't

1440
01:12:41,551 --> 01:12:46,290
come to that they were in the middle of
that point of consulting with other

1441
01:12:46,291 --> 01:12:49,440
professional sports leagues with the
other water labs.

1442
01:12:49,441 --> 01:12:51,780
They hadn't reached their conclusion
there.

1443
01:12:51,781 --> 01:12:54,060
Science expert hadn't determined,
hey,

1444
01:12:54,090 --> 01:12:55,560
this is definitely residual.

1445
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:58,260
No performance dancing.
They were still going through that data

1446
01:12:58,261 --> 01:13:00,630
at that point.
So what they've told me is,

1447
01:13:00,631 --> 01:13:02,790
look,
we tried to hurry that along as fast as

1448
01:13:02,791 --> 01:13:05,260
possible.
We wanted to make sure that,

1449
01:13:05,261 --> 01:13:08,940
that we went through this and very,
very detailed and no stone left

1450
01:13:08,941 --> 01:13:09,960
unturned.
When,

1451
01:13:09,961 --> 01:13:12,140
when did they reach this conclusion?
This.

1452
01:13:12,141 --> 01:13:14,390
So this was early december.
So December 6th,

1453
01:13:14,391 --> 01:13:18,090
that letter went out saying we've had
these two low level positives back in

1454
01:13:18,091 --> 01:13:19,080
august.
We're okay,

1455
01:13:19,081 --> 01:13:21,750
but here we are.
I mean this is the end of december.

1456
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:25,380
What could this have been headed off at
the pass?

1457
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:26,191
Well,
again,

1458
01:13:26,191 --> 01:13:29,550
when Nevada first got notified,
they thought like,

1459
01:13:29,551 --> 01:13:30,600
we were hoping,
well,

1460
01:13:30,601 --> 01:13:33,930
he's had four negative tests,
so he's probably going to be negative

1461
01:13:33,931 --> 01:13:35,340
going forward here,
right?

1462
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:36,203
I mean,
that's what,

1463
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:37,650
you know,
the lay person would think,

1464
01:13:37,651 --> 01:13:39,540
okay,
he's probably out of the woods now,

1465
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:41,160
but you know,
again,

1466
01:13:41,161 --> 01:13:45,750
getting back to what period of time is
this in john's preparation and if you

1467
01:13:45,751 --> 01:13:50,040
look at some of these numbers and when
these metabolites appear and disappear

1468
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,660
in early august,
john was preparing his defense for this

1469
01:13:54,661 --> 01:13:55,470
arbitration.

1470
01:13:55,470 --> 01:13:58,500
I think he had an idea based on talking
to his attorneys like,

1471
01:13:58,501 --> 01:14:01,230
hey,
we got a pretty good shot here of some

1472
01:14:01,231 --> 01:14:04,470
mitigating factors where this is
potentially going to get reduced.

1473
01:14:04,471 --> 01:14:05,900
So I think,
you know,

1474
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,430
he starts to get a little bit motivated,
gets in the gym,

1475
01:14:08,431 --> 01:14:11,890
starts training again clearly in early
december.

1476
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:15,700
That's a period of time when our
fighters that close to a fight are

1477
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:17,830
bringing down that body weight right
there,

1478
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:20,950
cutting body fat,
they're losing a little bit of water.

1479
01:14:21,370 --> 01:14:24,010
So it certainly seems to correlate
these,

1480
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:27,110
these,
these pulsing effects with when this

1481
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:29,480
theoretical right,
that close tissue.

1482
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:31,180
Absolutely it is.
So,

1483
01:14:31,181 --> 01:14:34,720
uh,
this positive result was announced when,

1484
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:40,380
so a week ago yesterday as you saw it as
announced,

1485
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,530
sought notifies us the ufc.
That always happens.

1486
01:14:44,531 --> 01:14:48,220
And they notify if any commission has
jurisdiction at this point.

1487
01:14:48,221 --> 01:14:50,650
This close to a fight.
Nevada has jurisdiction.

1488
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:56,460
So I get the call and you can imagine
what's going through my head.

1489
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:57,993
I mean,
I,

1490
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:00,250
I've gotten so many of these calls now.
I literally,

1491
01:15:00,251 --> 01:15:05,020
for the first five or 10 minutes,
can bury my head in my hand and think

1492
01:15:05,021 --> 01:15:07,210
through exactly how this thing's going
to play out.

1493
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:09,610
And you know,
it's going to be,

1494
01:15:09,611 --> 01:15:11,110
hey,
nevada's going to say,

1495
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,060
wait a second.
What's going on here?

1496
01:15:13,061 --> 01:15:16,540
We need to root this out.
John's going to say,

1497
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:17,740
jesus christ,
like,

1498
01:15:17,741 --> 01:15:20,500
what is going on in my life?
I can't get a fucking break.

1499
01:15:20,501 --> 01:15:25,210
I'm trying to be careful.
I even went through with dc how dc is

1500
01:15:25,211 --> 01:15:26,980
going to react and he reacts.
He's going to be.

1501
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:30,400
I fucking told you this was the case.
This guy's a cheater.

1502
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:32,260
You know,
you saw it as bullshit,

1503
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:35,140
novitsky bullshit.
All this stuff goes through my head and

1504
01:15:35,141 --> 01:15:36,730
the first five or 10 minutes,
what's,

1505
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:38,020
how's dana going to react?

1506
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:41,530
How hunters are gonna react when I have
to go over to his office and explained

1507
01:15:41,531 --> 01:15:44,320
this out to them.
It played out exactly as I saw it.

1508
01:15:44,321 --> 01:15:45,060
It's,
it's,

1509
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:48,100
it's some of the worst days of my career
when I get these calls.

1510
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,620
Um,
but you know,

1511
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:54,700
every bone was notified and in Nevada
was in our office two days later.

1512
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:56,020
And again,
I mean,

1513
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:58,660
there's been some criticism of them out
there.

1514
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:02,560
I don't fault them.
This is a complicated issue that

1515
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:07,060
optically doesn't look great and to do
anything in a rush manner would be

1516
01:16:07,061 --> 01:16:09,940
difficult.
They did everything they could to afford

1517
01:16:09,941 --> 01:16:12,820
us.
Having a hearing problem was,

1518
01:16:12,821 --> 01:16:15,250
it was just,
it was too close to a fight.

1519
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:19,600
So essentially to get this out,
this issue with optics,

1520
01:16:19,601 --> 01:16:21,610
right?
Because if you go on twitter,

1521
01:16:21,611 --> 01:16:24,130
everybody's calling him a cheat.
Everybody's saying that you know,

1522
01:16:24,131 --> 01:16:29,131
anybody that sanctions this is your
sanctioning cheating for someone to get

1523
01:16:30,251 --> 01:16:32,320
an understanding of what this is like.

1524
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:36,580
It actually requires probably more than
we've done now over the last hour and 15

1525
01:16:36,581 --> 01:16:37,130
minutes.
Yeah.

1526
01:16:37,130 --> 01:16:38,950
And I appreciate this forum.
I mean,

1527
01:16:38,951 --> 01:16:42,040
dana and I went on sports center and
announced it in three minute hit and I

1528
01:16:42,041 --> 01:16:44,890
came out of there going absolutely
everyone in the world's going to say,

1529
01:16:44,891 --> 01:16:46,360
this is bullshit.
You can't.

1530
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:48,610
This is what.
We're going to have a hard time doing

1531
01:16:48,611 --> 01:16:50,980
this in two hours here,
mrs.

1532
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:52,283
Yeah,
you've got.

1533
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:56,140
You've got to delve into it and you've
also have to put your trust and reliance

1534
01:16:56,141 --> 01:17:00,280
on these experts.
They have a education professional

1535
01:17:00,281 --> 01:17:04,060
career of 20 to 25 years to come up with
these absolutes.

1536
01:17:04,061 --> 01:17:08,500
There's no one else in the world,
but maybe a dozen people that can come

1537
01:17:08,501 --> 01:17:12,590
up with these conclusions.
You do have to put your faith in,

1538
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:16,070
in their background and their careers
and their knowledge and education and

1539
01:17:16,690 --> 01:17:19,580
you know,
read those absolutes were that there was

1540
01:17:19,581 --> 01:17:21,560
no evidence of any reinjection.

1541
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:26,560
This is by multiple experts and that
john would not have retained any

1542
01:17:26,991 --> 01:17:29,450
performance benefit based on these low
level pika.

1543
01:17:29,451 --> 01:17:30,950
Gram amounts.
Well,

1544
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:33,890
I'm happy that we were going to have
this out there so people,

1545
01:17:33,891 --> 01:17:36,380
if they have the time,
if they're really that interested in it.

1546
01:17:36,830 --> 01:17:40,240
This is probably a more in depth
discussion of this then you're going to

1547
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:43,310
get anywhere else,
but I really wish we could have gotten

1548
01:17:43,311 --> 01:17:46,940
something like this to Nevada and Nevada
could have gone over this and looked at

1549
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:48,290
what,
what I'm saying,

1550
01:17:48,291 --> 01:17:51,770
what you're saying.
It seems to me that we could have just

1551
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:55,850
had some sort of a meeting and kept his
fight in Nevada and it would have saved

1552
01:17:55,851 --> 01:17:58,070
everybody a lot of heartache.
Yeah,

1553
01:17:58,071 --> 01:18:00,500
I mean I think things were pointing in
that,

1554
01:18:00,501 --> 01:18:02,990
but there was no guarantees on that dice
baby.

1555
01:18:02,991 --> 01:18:04,340
It's still come on.

1556
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:05,690
It's vegas.
You know.

1557
01:18:05,691 --> 01:18:09,770
The other thing that was being looked at
was was fairness to these athletes.

1558
01:18:09,771 --> 01:18:12,920
Really you're going to.
You're going to put john and gus maybe

1559
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:16,730
more importantly in a position where he
doesn't know until two days or a day

1560
01:18:16,731 --> 01:18:19,460
before whether this fight is happening
or not.

1561
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:24,260
I mean these and not even mentioning the
other fighters on the card and look,

1562
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:28,280
you can talk to and I have to sean and
mick and dana and hunter.

1563
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:31,310
All these fighters want to be on the big
paper reviews.

1564
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:34,650
They know the bigger the fight at the
top of the car,

1565
01:18:34,651 --> 01:18:38,510
the more eyes are on that fight and when
you have a spectacular fight in the

1566
01:18:38,511 --> 01:18:43,100
first second fight on the card,
if it's on a big pay per view with a

1567
01:18:43,101 --> 01:18:45,680
giant fight at the top of it,
that can propel your career,

1568
01:18:45,681 --> 01:18:47,810
your next fight,
you could be fighting the main event on

1569
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,180
fight pass and progress from there.

1570
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:52,280
So I think,
you know,

1571
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:56,090
I think it's accurate to say that
generally everybody wants these,

1572
01:18:56,150 --> 01:19:00,770
these cards to be as big as possible and
when all the experts are telling us a

1573
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:04,220
hundred percent,
this isn't a sanction be he's not

1574
01:19:04,221 --> 01:19:06,410
retaining any performance enhancing
benefits.

1575
01:19:06,411 --> 01:19:08,900
I think,
and clearly dane and hunter thought

1576
01:19:08,901 --> 01:19:11,270
this,
we have an obligation to do what we can

1577
01:19:11,271 --> 01:19:15,020
do for fairness for john.
Definitely for,

1578
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:17,690
for gus,
for the rest of the card to try to make

1579
01:19:17,691 --> 01:19:20,840
this fight happen going forward.
Is there any way we could ever prevent

1580
01:19:20,841 --> 01:19:24,740
something like this from happening again
with a similar situation in place like

1581
01:19:24,741 --> 01:19:25,970
Nevada?
So here's.

1582
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:29,660
I think we have a couple solutions to
that and it's not necessarily relative

1583
01:19:29,661 --> 01:19:32,990
to the commission,
but one thing that obviously protected

1584
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:35,780
john a lot,
and this was the frequency of testing.

1585
01:19:36,290 --> 01:19:40,370
If you look at his numbers and these
were these were instances where they

1586
01:19:40,371 --> 01:19:42,860
collected samples,
but in many of these cases they did

1587
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:45,430
multiple tests on him and that means you
know,

1588
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,500
the tests I'm reading were for the
anabolic steroid panel,

1589
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:51,410
but in addition to that,
they may have done the biological

1590
01:19:51,411 --> 01:19:55,610
passport tests on that same collection
that may have done in hgh test and epo

1591
01:19:55,611 --> 01:19:57,870
test and this is all confidential that
you sought.

1592
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:00,650
It doesn't release all this information
with these numbers on the publicly

1593
01:20:00,651 --> 01:20:03,920
available website that you don't see
what those tests are done.

1594
01:20:03,921 --> 01:20:06,650
So the reality,
and they just told me this is john was

1595
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:09,450
one of the most,
if not the most tested athlete over

1596
01:20:09,451 --> 01:20:12,840
these last six months.
When you look at total amount of tests

1597
01:20:13,410 --> 01:20:14,700
on samples,
excuse me.

1598
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:19,590
One thing that obviously protecting them
here was that volume of testing.

1599
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:22,160
And so you saw to came to us and said,
you know,

1600
01:20:22,170 --> 01:20:24,750
hey,
we think that you probably should,

1601
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,180
you know,
up the amount of tests that you're

1602
01:20:27,181 --> 01:20:28,020
doing.
So,

1603
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:31,800
um,
we just renewed a contract with usada

1604
01:20:31,801 --> 01:20:34,350
and reduced.
We're increasing our testing numbers by

1605
01:20:34,351 --> 01:20:36,680
30 to 40 percent.
We currently,

1606
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:38,850
uh,
the first three years of the program

1607
01:20:38,851 --> 01:20:43,851
were under contract for approximately
2,700 tests and starting this next year

1608
01:20:44,221 --> 01:20:47,160
we're going to up that to around 43,
4,400 tests.

1609
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:50,700
So I think there going to be more of a
burden they're going to be,

1610
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:53,220
you know,
you saw to showing up in more doorsteps

1611
01:20:53,221 --> 01:20:55,200
early in the morning,
have more of our athletes.

1612
01:20:55,201 --> 01:20:57,300
But I think this is a perfect example
that,

1613
01:20:57,301 --> 01:21:01,140
that increased volume of testing
actually can be a protectant to the

1614
01:21:01,141 --> 01:21:02,910
athlete,
especially when you talk in these low

1615
01:21:02,911 --> 01:21:07,170
level pika gram quantities and
contaminated cases and things like that.

1616
01:21:07,470 --> 01:21:10,780
We just got to get athletes to stopped
taking any supplement.

1617
01:21:10,781 --> 01:21:12,730
It's not third party tested.
Great point.

1618
01:21:12,731 --> 01:21:17,340
So here's what we've done in that area.
So about three months ago you saw a

1619
01:21:17,341 --> 01:21:20,400
hosted a working group.
It included the ufc,

1620
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:23,790
myself and our nutritionist clinton
wattenberg,

1621
01:21:23,791 --> 01:21:26,550
who you've met,
were there major majorly baseball,

1622
01:21:26,551 --> 01:21:29,670
was there,
the department of defense was there,

1623
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:34,700
there's been war fighters who have
purchased supplements at bases over in

1624
01:21:34,921 --> 01:21:38,550
Iraq and Afghanistan that contain
ephedrine and other bad products.

1625
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:42,030
Some of them potentially have died as a
result of ingesting them,

1626
01:21:42,031 --> 01:21:46,050
so they definitely have an interest in
safety and dietary supplements and you

1627
01:21:46,051 --> 01:21:50,370
saw it as experts were there.
What we did is we invited in the major

1628
01:21:50,371 --> 01:21:55,140
third party certification companies and
each one took a half day presenting what

1629
01:21:55,141 --> 01:21:59,070
their programs look like.
We went back and huddled after each one

1630
01:21:59,071 --> 01:22:03,540
and huddled at the conclusion and said,
what is a platinum standard third party

1631
01:22:03,541 --> 01:22:06,780
certification look like?
Let's all these presentations we got

1632
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:11,220
what was and one's weaknesses and the
others and we have to put a perfect one

1633
01:22:11,221 --> 01:22:12,060
together.
What was it?

1634
01:22:12,210 --> 01:22:15,810
What does it look like over the last
month we've been offering,

1635
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:18,030
um,
a paper that's going to be published in

1636
01:22:18,031 --> 01:22:22,560
a scientific journal going over with
that gold standard platinum standard.

1637
01:22:22,561 --> 01:22:27,561
Looks like I'm going forward any third
party certification company that can

1638
01:22:28,381 --> 01:22:30,300
meet that and there's some that are very
close.

1639
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:32,040
I think we'll be able to do it very
quickly.

1640
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:36,220
We are going to say,
you saw it is going to say this is an

1641
01:22:36,221 --> 01:22:40,730
approved line of supplements.
We approve you to take this and this is

1642
01:22:40,731 --> 01:22:43,410
something that we've been unable to do
in the first three and a half years of

1643
01:22:43,411 --> 01:22:46,770
the program and I tell you,
joe is the most common question I get

1644
01:22:46,771 --> 01:22:50,130
from our athletes.
What's you sought approved and as soon

1645
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:53,310
as I say you doesn't approve any
supplements,

1646
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:57,300
but here's how you ensure your safety.
They stop listening.

1647
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:02,160
Goes in one ear out the other.
This is a silly suggestion,

1648
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:06,970
but why doesn't the ufc come up with its
own supplement and provide them to the

1649
01:23:06,971 --> 01:23:09,280
fighters and say,
you can't take anything else.

1650
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:11,740
Yeah,
I mean it is after they've been through.

1651
01:23:11,741 --> 01:23:14,330
It's had sponsorships with other
supplement line.

1652
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:16,270
Exactly.
There's a lot of dynamics to it.

1653
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:20,530
It's not as easy as doing it overnight
and distillation method.

1654
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:22,240
Just if you could say,
hey,

1655
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:24,130
you can take creatine,
you could take,

1656
01:23:24,131 --> 01:23:26,140
you know,
all the multivitamins,

1657
01:23:26,141 --> 01:23:29,950
you could take a branch chain amino
acids and all these things that have

1658
01:23:29,951 --> 01:23:32,830
been proven to be effective,
but that's weird too.

1659
01:23:32,831 --> 01:23:34,450
Right?
It's like they're effective.

1660
01:23:34,451 --> 01:23:36,310
Meaning they enhanced performance and
recovery,

1661
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:39,940
but they don't do enough to be
considered a performance enhancing drug.

1662
01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:41,590
Yeah.
And their president in the food supply.

1663
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:46,480
So like basically out of community you
can go eat 10 chicken breasts or you

1664
01:23:46,481 --> 01:23:48,940
know,
have a couple of scoops of protein if

1665
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:50,650
you're on the go and don't have time to
do it.

1666
01:23:50,651 --> 01:23:53,080
So I think again,
apples and oranges in terms of

1667
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:56,290
performance enhancing or not.
Um,

1668
01:23:56,291 --> 01:23:58,720
so the theory would be we have an
approved when,

1669
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:01,660
when I'm or dawn or asked that question,
what's approved,

1670
01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:06,610
I can say here's,
let's say nsf nsf has 1200 supplements

1671
01:24:06,611 --> 01:24:07,090
that are approved.

1672
01:24:07,090 --> 01:24:10,570
I'd say all 1200 of these or approved.
You should only use these.

1673
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:14,740
If something were to happen to an
athlete that used and approved line of

1674
01:24:14,741 --> 01:24:16,810
supplements to get out of jail free
card.

1675
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:19,030
If they can prove it.
And you saw it independently,

1676
01:24:19,031 --> 01:24:20,350
prove it.
There's no sanction.

1677
01:24:20,351 --> 01:24:23,890
I think that is going to go a long way
and I'll give you a reason for that.

1678
01:24:23,950 --> 01:24:27,520
Major league baseball does that.
They have for the last couple of years

1679
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:31,990
now they have some advantage and that
all their athletes are employees and are

1680
01:24:31,991 --> 01:24:35,230
coming into the same facility for during
the season.

1681
01:24:35,231 --> 01:24:37,630
So they have some control over there.
Well we don't.

1682
01:24:38,050 --> 01:24:41,620
Our athletes are spread amongst 46
countries throughout the world,

1683
01:24:41,621 --> 01:24:45,670
so it's more of a challenge.
But baseball's said the only supplements

1684
01:24:45,671 --> 01:24:49,520
we're allowing in the clubhouse or in a
facility are.

1685
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:53,530
They use nsf supplements.
They had zero contaminated supplement

1686
01:24:53,531 --> 01:24:57,220
cases last year they had,
I think they're testing numbers were

1687
01:24:57,221 --> 01:25:00,910
four times the amount of our testing
numbers and zero contaminated

1688
01:25:00,911 --> 01:25:01,480
supplements.

1689
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:03,310
I mean the proof's in the pudding right
there.

1690
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:07,570
So they had worked with deal with nsf.
I don't know if it's a deal other than

1691
01:25:07,571 --> 01:25:11,720
they've examined who those certification
companies are and they feel that they're

1692
01:25:12,010 --> 01:25:15,910
at the top of the line.
We don't want to exclude any.

1693
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,670
And that's why we're contributing to
this paper to say,

1694
01:25:18,671 --> 01:25:20,800
look,
anyone could be one of these approved

1695
01:25:20,801 --> 01:25:23,200
lines,
but you must meet this criteria for

1696
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:25,960
platinum standard program,
but it's coming from someone who's in a

1697
01:25:25,961 --> 01:25:27,730
supplement business.
Me,

1698
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:30,310
that's the wild west out there.
Boy is it.

1699
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:34,450
I mean there's a.
There's a lot of shit out there that's

1700
01:25:34,451 --> 01:25:38,320
just.
They purposely add performance enhancing

1701
01:25:38,321 --> 01:25:42,370
drugs to their stuff because it's cheap
and people take it.

1702
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:45,760
They experience these gains and then
they sell a lot of it and then you get a

1703
01:25:45,761 --> 01:25:46,630
following.
Exactly.

1704
01:25:46,631 --> 01:25:50,890
I saw that when I was with the fda,
there is what they normally will do for

1705
01:25:50,891 --> 01:25:52,750
maybe the first six months of the
product.

1706
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:56,170
They'll spike it with something if
they're going that route and then to

1707
01:25:56,171 --> 01:25:59,080
decrease liability thereafter.
They've already got the following,

1708
01:25:59,590 --> 01:26:03,260
stuff's working like like hell,
and then they back off just in the

1709
01:26:03,261 --> 01:26:05,150
government and it doesn't work.
And people go,

1710
01:26:05,151 --> 01:26:10,151
oh my body must have adapted exactly
this.

1711
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:14,870
It's really such a shame because this is
such a fantastic fight.

1712
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:18,290
I mean there's so much drama involved
already.

1713
01:26:18,291 --> 01:26:22,790
Just having John Jones returning,
having alexander gustafson looking

1714
01:26:22,791 --> 01:26:27,740
absolutely sensational in his last fight
with glover to sharer all the trash talk

1715
01:26:27,741 --> 01:26:31,790
and hype and intensity in the fact that
this is really other than dc versus

1716
01:26:31,791 --> 01:26:33,590
john.
This is the fight that people want to

1717
01:26:33,591 --> 01:26:35,690
see in the light heavyweight division,
and look,

1718
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:38,480
nobody's saying that.
I'm certainly not saying that john

1719
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:41,120
didn't do anything wrong.
He obviously did.

1720
01:26:41,210 --> 01:26:46,210
John has two times now tested positive
for prohibited substance,

1721
01:26:46,670 --> 01:26:49,700
says however,
in both occasions,

1722
01:26:49,701 --> 01:26:53,240
arbitrators have determined that it was
not done intentionally.

1723
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:55,460
So anyone who says that,
oh,

1724
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:58,580
john's getting off light on this,
he's been suspended for almost two and a

1725
01:26:58,581 --> 01:27:03,530
half years,
for lack with a lack of evidence of any

1726
01:27:03,590 --> 01:27:07,670
intentional use are cheating.
You know how much money he's probably

1727
01:27:07,671 --> 01:27:11,750
lost in those two and a half years.
How many tens of millions of dollars

1728
01:27:11,751 --> 01:27:14,990
doesn't reputation?
Anybody who says that he got off scot

1729
01:27:14,991 --> 01:27:18,380
free on this?
I would argue the otherwise he was held

1730
01:27:18,381 --> 01:27:21,230
to the strictest of liability standards
out there.

1731
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:24,320
Someone at the top of their game,
money earning potential like him.

1732
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:27,680
There's also an incredible amount of
stress and,

1733
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:31,610
and it's on him just a human being,
he feels and he hears what people are

1734
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:34,670
saying about them and that's,
that's got to be very difficult also,

1735
01:27:34,671 --> 01:27:36,980
again,
coming off of this massive suspension.

1736
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:39,470
So he's coming off of the suspension,
which was huge,

1737
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:43,150
very public,
very worldwide after the cocaine,

1738
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:44,410
the car accident,
the,

1739
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:47,720
the previous,
the dick pills that had the stuff and I

1740
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:49,610
mean this is so many things.

1741
01:27:49,790 --> 01:27:53,720
And then to have this happen literally
the week of and have the fight moved to

1742
01:27:53,721 --> 01:27:55,670
California.
I mean,

1743
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,770
and I get the skepticism that's out
there.

1744
01:27:57,830 --> 01:27:59,930
Again,
without delving into this,

1745
01:27:59,931 --> 01:28:04,550
I've spent hours and hours and these
experts have spent their careers looking

1746
01:28:04,551 --> 01:28:06,830
into that.
That's really what's required to get a

1747
01:28:06,831 --> 01:28:09,860
comprehension and understanding of it.
Um,

1748
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:11,840
another thing,
another argument,

1749
01:28:11,841 --> 01:28:14,900
john's being treated specially because
he's john,

1750
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:19,790
but we had another athlete that this
somewhat identical thing happened too,

1751
01:28:19,791 --> 01:28:23,510
but nowhere near at the level of john.
So a kid by the name of grant dawson.

1752
01:28:24,110 --> 01:28:28,520
So grant dawson last summer was in the
data white contender series,

1753
01:28:29,210 --> 01:28:31,070
had an awesome fight.
Dane is like,

1754
01:28:31,071 --> 01:28:33,250
you've got a contract kid.
Uh,

1755
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:35,580
we get them into the usada program that
we,

1756
01:28:35,581 --> 01:28:40,160
you solder quote program requires you to
disclose everything you've used going

1757
01:28:40,161 --> 01:28:43,370
back 12 months or one year.
The idea being,

1758
01:28:43,371 --> 01:28:45,440
look,
even though you weren't under the

1759
01:28:45,441 --> 01:28:47,210
program,
if you've used,

1760
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:49,820
you know,
oral terenna ball eight or nine months

1761
01:28:49,821 --> 01:28:52,510
ago,
there could still be an advantage that

1762
01:28:52,511 --> 01:28:53,740
you'd be getting,
you know,

1763
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:56,750
we're not going to necessarily suspend
you because you weren't subject to the

1764
01:28:56,751 --> 01:28:58,480
program then,
but we're not going to let you fight.

1765
01:28:58,490 --> 01:29:00,230
All right away.
You're gonna have to be in the program

1766
01:29:00,231 --> 01:29:02,190
for a certain amount of time testing
clean.

1767
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:05,550
So he didn't,
he didn't disclose that he was using

1768
01:29:05,551 --> 01:29:06,960
anything.
His first test,

1769
01:29:06,961 --> 01:29:10,770
he tests positive for m,
three metabolite low levels.

1770
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:14,220
He goes to arbitration,
argues,

1771
01:29:14,221 --> 01:29:16,830
testifies under oath.
I've never heard of this substance.

1772
01:29:16,831 --> 01:29:19,500
I've never taken it.
I would never cheat.

1773
01:29:19,530 --> 01:29:21,060
Here are all the supplements I was
using.

1774
01:29:21,061 --> 01:29:23,580
I can't find it.
The arbitrator.

1775
01:29:23,610 --> 01:29:25,950
Here's the hearing you saw.
It goes to them and says,

1776
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:28,980
hold on a second.
We're looking into this matter talking

1777
01:29:28,981 --> 01:29:32,010
to baseball,
whatever you sorta comes out that,

1778
01:29:32,011 --> 01:29:34,730
hey,
we can't prove that this didn't enter

1779
01:29:34,731 --> 01:29:39,330
his substance a year before that
disclosure required him to disclose what

1780
01:29:39,331 --> 01:29:42,490
he was using,
so he was basically lead often an

1781
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:46,830
eligible,
so john's not the only person in the ufc

1782
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:50,340
that this has happened to,
not not withstanding other professional

1783
01:29:50,341 --> 01:29:51,900
sports leagues,
other olympics.

1784
01:29:51,901 --> 01:29:55,290
It's happened to other athletes.
He's not the only one.

1785
01:29:56,630 --> 01:30:01,370
So I think what's important for people.
I get the skepticism,

1786
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:06,260
but I think it's very important that
people don't accuse someone of something

1787
01:30:06,261 --> 01:30:09,950
that they didn't do and I want you,
if you're listening to this,

1788
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:14,600
I want you to imagine if you're John
Jones and you trying to get your shit

1789
01:30:14,601 --> 01:30:18,080
together and you didn't do anything new,
he didn't do anything different.

1790
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:22,340
We've got to have a path of redemption
for people.

1791
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:23,330
You've got.
You have to.

1792
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:26,570
And if john,
as you're saying,

1793
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:30,350
and all of these tests conclude,
if he didn't do anything,

1794
01:30:30,890 --> 01:30:32,810
folks,
you've got to stop saying he's cheating.

1795
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:35,660
You got.
He's not cheating if he's not cheating

1796
01:30:35,661 --> 01:30:39,500
and if it's showing that these are these
longterm residual metabolites that are

1797
01:30:39,501 --> 01:30:44,060
an incredibly small dosage,
it's there's a real cheaters out there

1798
01:30:44,061 --> 01:30:47,420
and john's fucked up.
He has fucked up and you were all right

1799
01:30:47,421 --> 01:30:48,950
to be upset at him when he fucked up.

1800
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:53,000
This is not his leases.
My conclusion after talking to you and

1801
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:55,370
and and I've,
I've talked to some independent

1802
01:30:55,371 --> 01:30:57,860
scientists that were skeptical about
some of the aspects of it,

1803
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:02,020
but they're also,
they're skeptical because they're not up

1804
01:31:02,021 --> 01:31:07,021
to date perhaps on the differences in
this pulsing effect or the fact that

1805
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:13,230
this is something that is relatively.
There's not a lot of,

1806
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:17,630
a lot of documentation on this.
I mean this is something that's

1807
01:31:17,631 --> 01:31:21,620
relatively new in terms of our ability
to understand pika grams.

1808
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:24,380
Our ability to understand this pulsing
affect all these different,

1809
01:31:24,590 --> 01:31:27,890
these variables that you have to take
into account when it comes to this.

1810
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:30,800
People love to call cheat.
They love to and it's good.

1811
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:33,170
It's good that the people were out there
keeping people honest,

1812
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:37,610
but I think you gotta we gotta look at
this the right way and I think the right

1813
01:31:37,611 --> 01:31:39,950
way is what you're,
the way you're laying it out here,

1814
01:31:39,951 --> 01:31:40,784
I don't see any holes,

1815
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:44,910
so a couple things in the future that
people can look forward to.

1816
01:31:44,911 --> 01:31:47,450
Look,
we want and john wants to fight in

1817
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:50,100
Nevada and Nevada is basically said,
look,

1818
01:31:50,101 --> 01:31:52,410
I think we understand this issue,
but we need to have this hearing.

1819
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:56,460
There will be a public hearing on this.
My understanding is early quarter one,

1820
01:31:56,461 --> 01:31:58,290
so look,
you know,

1821
01:31:58,410 --> 01:32:00,190
don't take word for it.
Wait until

1822
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:02,080
january.
I'm sure they'll call some of these

1823
01:32:02,081 --> 01:32:05,840
experts to testify.
Introduce some of these documents into

1824
01:32:05,890 --> 01:32:08,500
the public record longer even than this
conversation.

1825
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,000
Yes,
that would be my guess.

1826
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:11,260
Yeah.
Um,

1827
01:32:11,470 --> 01:32:13,080
so yeah,
I mean that's,

1828
01:32:13,130 --> 01:32:16,420
that's to come.
The whole thing is such a disaster for

1829
01:32:16,421 --> 01:32:20,110
everybody else on the card for Amanda
Nunez and cris cyborg and for all the

1830
01:32:20,111 --> 01:32:21,450
people on the undercard.
I mean,

1831
01:32:21,451 --> 01:32:26,290
it's just to have them to move all the
way to California when I'm happy about

1832
01:32:26,291 --> 01:32:29,740
those that the fight is still happening,
I'm very happy to fight is still

1833
01:32:29,741 --> 01:32:31,020
happening.
I am.

1834
01:32:31,021 --> 01:32:33,910
And again,
I have to take an objective look about

1835
01:32:34,070 --> 01:32:38,830
is this fair as it relates to how our
policy and what the rules are and you

1836
01:32:38,831 --> 01:32:39,850
know,
when you have,

1837
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:42,790
you know,
one of the experts in the world,

1838
01:32:42,791 --> 01:32:46,390
Dr. Daniel lackner,
other myrtle laboratory issue an

1839
01:32:46,391 --> 01:32:51,220
absolute statement like there is no
evidence that dh cmt has been

1840
01:32:51,221 --> 01:32:55,120
readministered and that based on these
low levels,

1841
01:32:55,420 --> 01:32:58,210
he does not retaining a performance
enhancing benefit.

1842
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:01,180
How out of fairness and implementing the
program,

1843
01:33:01,181 --> 01:33:03,820
do you prevent this from happening?
You can't do that.

1844
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:08,020
It would be categorically unfair.
Um,

1845
01:33:08,110 --> 01:33:12,730
moving forward from here,
what changes and what do we do to stop

1846
01:33:12,731 --> 01:33:14,320
something like this from happening
again?

1847
01:33:14,321 --> 01:33:16,720
I think the increased volume of testing
is going to help.

1848
01:33:17,230 --> 01:33:22,230
I think being able to specifically
direct our athletes to approve line of

1849
01:33:22,301 --> 01:33:25,070
supplements will help.
Um,

1850
01:33:25,150 --> 01:33:26,140
but you know,
hey,

1851
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:29,860
we can don and I can message the hell
out of these things.

1852
01:33:29,861 --> 01:33:31,110
But you know,
it,

1853
01:33:31,230 --> 01:33:31,960
it,
it,

1854
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:34,960
it takes the athletes and their camps to
listen to what we're saying.

1855
01:33:34,961 --> 01:33:36,760
So I mean if anything good comes out of
this,

1856
01:33:36,761 --> 01:33:41,650
hopefully it's a warning to those other
others out there about how careful you

1857
01:33:41,651 --> 01:33:45,250
need to be.
So just to wrap this up so people

1858
01:33:45,251 --> 01:33:48,010
understand if you,
if you want to put a button on this,

1859
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:50,940
there is no evidence whatsoever of any
microdosing.

1860
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:54,520
So this is one of the concerns people
were worried about microdosing no

1861
01:33:54,521 --> 01:33:57,370
evidence whatsoever of microdosing
wouldn't be a substance.

1862
01:33:57,371 --> 01:34:00,580
You were generally microdose.
You do endogenous substances,

1863
01:34:00,581 --> 01:34:05,380
not exotic enough is also no evidence of
the short term and medium term.

1864
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:07,960
A medium,
a medium term.

1865
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:11,590
Yup.
Metabolites that were recognized by

1866
01:34:11,591 --> 01:34:13,630
virtue of that.
Say his name again.

1867
01:34:13,660 --> 01:34:18,460
I think it is gregory.
I have a tough time with Gregory Gregory

1868
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:19,393
caligari.

1869
01:34:21,190 --> 01:34:24,430
That's the only test we have no parent
compound ever found as well.

1870
01:34:24,730 --> 01:34:28,570
These are these the only tests we have
that show these longterm short term and

1871
01:34:28,571 --> 01:34:30,800
medium term metabolites.
These,

1872
01:34:30,830 --> 01:34:35,350
the short term in the medium term ones
that would be indicative of him taking

1873
01:34:35,351 --> 01:34:39,310
it recently don't exist at any point in
time during these testing.

1874
01:34:39,330 --> 01:34:42,460
Correct.
So this is most likely something that is

1875
01:34:43,150 --> 01:34:46,540
inside of his body that is an incredibly
small levels.

1876
01:34:46,870 --> 01:34:51,870
And is it safe to say that the detection
levels that the detection methods are

1877
01:34:53,650 --> 01:34:56,590
far superior today than they were a year
ago,

1878
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:58,250
two years ago,
three years ago,

1879
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:01,190
increase by thousands of percentage
points,

1880
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:03,290
insensitivity,
I mean again,

1881
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:06,110
and how recently over the last five
years.

1882
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:11,560
And how recently have they,
if they improved from today versus a

1883
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:12,021
year ago?
Yeah,

1884
01:35:12,021 --> 01:35:13,550
I believe so.
Again,

1885
01:35:13,551 --> 01:35:15,530
you know,
when I heard about the one pika gram

1886
01:35:15,531 --> 01:35:17,860
detection of the n three metabolite,
you know,

1887
01:35:17,870 --> 01:35:19,370
that was something that happened this
year.

1888
01:35:19,371 --> 01:35:24,020
I'm not aware of that ever being that
low of a number in any time in the past.

1889
01:35:24,021 --> 01:35:25,480
So I think,
you know,

1890
01:35:25,490 --> 01:35:28,970
literally week by week,
month by month as we're going here,

1891
01:35:29,270 --> 01:35:32,590
that level of sensitivity is increasing
exponentially.

1892
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:37,490
No possible performance enhancing
benefits from these incredibly low

1893
01:35:37,491 --> 01:35:39,860
levels.
That's what the experts are telling me.

1894
01:35:39,950 --> 01:35:40,820
Look.
And again,

1895
01:35:40,821 --> 01:35:43,790
I'm not the expert,
I don't want to profess that I am,

1896
01:35:43,791 --> 01:35:46,070
but what,
what do I have to go to?

1897
01:35:46,071 --> 01:35:49,730
I need to go to those experts that have
made careers out of studying these

1898
01:35:49,731 --> 01:35:53,900
substances and the benefits and they are
all universally telling me that there's

1899
01:35:53,901 --> 01:35:55,400
no performance enhancing benefit.

1900
01:35:55,580 --> 01:36:00,580
Full compliance by jon jones in terms of
being there for usada at every single

1901
01:36:00,711 --> 01:36:03,590
test.
A notifying his whereabouts,

1902
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:06,740
doing everything by the book.
In terms of what the ufc requires and

1903
01:36:06,741 --> 01:36:07,750
what you saw to require.
Yeah.

1904
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:10,550
So our program has a three strike
policy.

1905
01:36:10,551 --> 01:36:11,990
So basically,
you know,

1906
01:36:11,991 --> 01:36:15,350
if you miss a test for an unexplained
reason three times,

1907
01:36:15,351 --> 01:36:19,370
then it could be a violation.
John's never had one whereabouts strike.

1908
01:36:19,371 --> 01:36:22,430
He's always been available when you saw
it as tried to test them.

1909
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:24,350
And again,
especially recently,

1910
01:36:24,410 --> 01:36:27,440
recently one of the most tested athletes
in the ufc.

1911
01:36:27,650 --> 01:36:32,270
Wasn't there one test in the past where
you saw to showed up at the gym and

1912
01:36:32,271 --> 01:36:35,040
there was some sort of speculation that
john was hiding under the ring preview.

1913
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:39,630
Sada sada before I got here.
I've heard about that at all.

1914
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:42,110
The details.
I don't know whether it's true or not.

1915
01:36:42,110 --> 01:36:44,360
I think there's a Nevada state athletic
commission test.

1916
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:46,780
My recollection's right,
but it wasn't he not a test.

1917
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:50,810
Okay,
so there's no reason in terms of how

1918
01:36:50,811 --> 01:36:55,640
you're looking at this particular case
that this fight should not take place or

1919
01:36:55,641 --> 01:36:57,410
that john should be sanctioned any
further.

1920
01:36:57,470 --> 01:36:58,450
There isn't.
And look,

1921
01:36:58,590 --> 01:37:02,030
it's the least compelling argument,
but I think you know,

1922
01:37:02,031 --> 01:37:04,640
you have to look at it.
You have to look at the common sense

1923
01:37:04,641 --> 01:37:09,500
approach to this.
A guy who went through a year and a half

1924
01:37:09,501 --> 01:37:14,300
almost suspension to very,
I would categorize as embarrassing

1925
01:37:14,301 --> 01:37:19,301
public hearings in California along
arbitration hearing before mclaren.

1926
01:37:19,940 --> 01:37:24,080
All this science is rooted out about how
long this stuff stays in your system,

1927
01:37:24,081 --> 01:37:26,900
longterm metabolites for months,
maybe years.

1928
01:37:27,650 --> 01:37:32,300
You're going to choose to use oral
terenna ball still after going through

1929
01:37:32,301 --> 01:37:35,720
all that leading up to a fight.
I don't buy that.

1930
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:37,130
See,
I don't think.

1931
01:37:37,220 --> 01:37:41,870
I think I agree with what you're saying,
but in terms of people fucking up,

1932
01:37:42,170 --> 01:37:47,170
there are no bounds on human stupidity
and in terms of people's ability to do

1933
01:37:47,721 --> 01:37:51,920
impulsive things that are irrational,
that wind up sabotaging their career is

1934
01:37:51,921 --> 01:37:55,920
almost more of an indication that people
are willing to do that than not.

1935
01:37:56,090 --> 01:37:58,950
It's very.
It's like you're less likely,

1936
01:37:59,010 --> 01:38:02,100
and this is in terms of especially in
particular in fighters,

1937
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:05,940
fighters are ridiculously impulsive.
It's one of the things that categorizes

1938
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:10,110
and it's a characteristic of the type of
human being that gets involved in that

1939
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:13,580
line of work in the first place.
They're wild motherfuckers.

1940
01:38:13,650 --> 01:38:17,090
They're crazy.
They do crazy shit and I just.

1941
01:38:17,091 --> 01:38:18,360
I don't,
I don't buy that.

1942
01:38:18,390 --> 01:38:22,170
That would be new level crazy look.
Can I categorize this as a new level?

1943
01:38:22,171 --> 01:38:24,450
Crazy guy.
Least compelling argument.

1944
01:38:24,451 --> 01:38:25,740
I agree.
At least compelling,

1945
01:38:25,741 --> 01:38:28,260
but I think we'd be remiss if we didn't
at least consider that.

1946
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:29,670
I.
Okay.

1947
01:38:29,671 --> 01:38:33,180
I see your point.
I don't buy it that that part I don't

1948
01:38:33,181 --> 01:38:35,700
buy.
I buy all the science and I'm a big John

1949
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:36,391
Jones fan.
I mean,

1950
01:38:36,391 --> 01:38:39,720
you can call me a John Jones suck up all
day long.

1951
01:38:39,721 --> 01:38:42,420
I think he's one of the greatest of all
time and I think it's not over for him.

1952
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:46,260
I think he still could reach.
I don't even think he's at his peak.

1953
01:38:46,261 --> 01:38:50,340
I think he's still got time to be the
greatest of all time if he hasn't

1954
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:53,190
already achieved that,
but I think that he's also.

1955
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:54,800
He's a wild man,
you know?

1956
01:38:54,810 --> 01:38:56,370
It's one of the reasons why he's so
great.

1957
01:38:56,371 --> 01:38:59,460
It's one of the reasons why you opened
up the fight with shogun at 22 years old

1958
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:03,080
with a flying knee and he's a wild
motherfucker.

1959
01:39:03,090 --> 01:39:08,090
That's who he is and it's one of many
reasons besides his talent that he's so

1960
01:39:08,851 --> 01:39:12,150
god damn good.
I know the lows of the lows.

1961
01:39:12,151 --> 01:39:15,330
He's gone through these last two years.
You will have to leave.

1962
01:39:15,331 --> 01:39:18,030
How low those lines.
So again,

1963
01:39:18,031 --> 01:39:19,710
look,
I don't disagree with you that that's

1964
01:39:19,711 --> 01:39:22,830
not out of the area of consideration,
but man,

1965
01:39:22,831 --> 01:39:24,210
I,
I just don't.

1966
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:26,610
I don't think anybody could be that
reckless.

1967
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:31,700
I hope you're right.
I also worry that fighters often in

1968
01:39:32,641 --> 01:39:34,440
times,
and I'm not accusing john of doing this,

1969
01:39:34,650 --> 01:39:39,420
but oftentimes surround themselves with
morons and these morons give them poor

1970
01:39:39,421 --> 01:39:44,421
advice and these morons think that they
have ways to skirt systems and get

1971
01:39:45,751 --> 01:39:48,550
around the rules and they have people
that you know,

1972
01:39:49,170 --> 01:39:51,810
throw a bunch of fancy words their way
and they want to believe,

1973
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:55,080
and this happens all the time.
This happens all the time with fighters

1974
01:39:55,081 --> 01:39:58,740
in regards to financial management and
advice that they get with that.

1975
01:39:59,610 --> 01:40:03,900
I mean I've seen like world class
fighters do ridiculous shit in terms of

1976
01:40:04,050 --> 01:40:07,800
strength and conditioning because some
asshole with a good vocabulary talks him

1977
01:40:07,801 --> 01:40:11,340
into some nonsense.
This is just one of the things that

1978
01:40:11,341 --> 01:40:15,150
happens with fighters and oftentimes
they can be around someone who gives him

1979
01:40:15,151 --> 01:40:18,960
poor advice in terms of what they can
and cannot get away with when it comes

1980
01:40:18,961 --> 01:40:21,960
to supplementation and when it comes to
steroid use.

1981
01:40:21,990 --> 01:40:22,830
Yeah,
absolutely.

1982
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:25,890
I see that all over the place.
In john's case,

1983
01:40:25,891 --> 01:40:27,960
however,
to give credit where credit's due,

1984
01:40:28,010 --> 01:40:30,900
you know,
his team after the initial positive with

1985
01:40:30,901 --> 01:40:35,901
the dick pills was very interactive with
me and donna and checking supplements.

1986
01:40:36,151 --> 01:40:38,940
Hey,
what line should we go to show they,

1987
01:40:38,970 --> 01:40:40,140
you know,
to give them credit.

1988
01:40:40,141 --> 01:40:43,560
They definitely showed an increased
exercise of care when it came to

1989
01:40:43,561 --> 01:40:46,440
supplementation with john.
Well that's great to hear and I really

1990
01:40:46,441 --> 01:40:49,350
hope this is a thing of the past and I
hope this is the last time we ever have

1991
01:40:49,351 --> 01:40:53,380
to talk about john in this term and that
moving forward we just talk about in

1992
01:40:53,381 --> 01:40:54,610
terms of his performances

1993
01:40:54,610 --> 01:40:56,320
in his,
his fights and you know,

1994
01:40:56,370 --> 01:40:59,030
what?
He's already achieved the youngest sea

1995
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:01,750
champion of all time.
Anything else?

1996
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:03,640
Yeah,
so I was going to bring this up at the

1997
01:41:03,641 --> 01:41:06,730
beginning,
but the golden snitch,

1998
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,780
that's first of all,
that's brendan shop's name.

1999
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:14,350
He gave it to you,
so taken on a life of its own and I

2000
01:41:14,351 --> 01:41:17,350
think.
I think the last time we talked about

2001
01:41:17,351 --> 01:41:21,660
donna asking alexa who
see,

2002
01:41:22,350 --> 01:41:23,990
see what siri says.
Hold on a second.

2003
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,570
Let's see what siri says,
but I've never tried this.

2004
01:41:26,650 --> 01:41:30,870
Hold on a second.
Who is the golden snitch?

2005
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:35,160
He's some inflammation.
Wow.

2006
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:38,880
Oh yeah.
Stitch something in Harry Potter,

2007
01:41:39,550 --> 01:41:42,000
which I didn't know that the last time
on.

2008
01:41:42,001 --> 01:41:46,860
And I mentioned I think my week of pd,
a profile it had me as aka the golden

2009
01:41:46,861 --> 01:41:48,540
snitch.
Somebody took that down.

2010
01:41:49,740 --> 01:41:52,950
Hey siri,
who is the golden snitch?

2011
01:41:55,780 --> 01:41:58,430
Siri.
Siri keeps going with quad itch.

2012
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:00,760
So,
so someone took it down.

2013
01:42:01,970 --> 01:42:02,741
They do that.
Well,

2014
01:42:02,741 --> 01:42:03,880
I think we talked about.
You're like,

2015
01:42:03,910 --> 01:42:04,743
eh,
I don't know.

2016
01:42:05,130 --> 01:42:07,200
They just did it.
Um,

2017
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:10,480
so I think I totally messed that up
already.

2018
01:42:10,540 --> 01:42:13,390
Coworkers call me in.
My family calls me.

2019
01:42:13,510 --> 01:42:15,130
They call you,
the goldens friends call me.

2020
01:42:16,030 --> 01:42:20,440
I was at the mma awards last year and
some yahoo had a few pops back in me is

2021
01:42:20,441 --> 01:42:23,890
screaming in between presentations,
the golden snitches.

2022
01:42:24,630 --> 01:42:28,260
I'm slinking down in my chair,
my girlfriend and I.

2023
01:42:28,261 --> 01:42:31,100
It is dam the golden snitches backup
already.

2024
01:42:31,110 --> 01:42:32,590
Do you have to see on the end of the
neck popped up?

2025
01:42:32,650 --> 01:42:34,630
Beautiful.
Just fucking.

2026
01:42:34,660 --> 01:42:36,610
When they do that,
just put your hands up in the air.

2027
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:40,090
So you definitely should make a shirt
during shows.

2028
01:42:40,091 --> 01:42:43,810
I'll sit pretty close to the cage,
go out in between a fight into the

2029
01:42:43,811 --> 01:42:47,350
bathroom and it's not joe rogan level
will half the damn arena standing up.

2030
01:42:47,350 --> 01:42:49,960
Excited to see you walking in and out of
the fight or walk.

2031
01:42:49,961 --> 01:42:53,530
But two or three people in that walk
when I go backstage and check on each

2032
01:42:53,531 --> 01:42:57,440
side of the golden snitch.
So give them reckon.

2033
01:42:57,490 --> 01:42:59,050
You know steve reed,
you know,

2034
01:42:59,051 --> 01:43:01,960
so you've read our ball security,
that bad ass looking guy on stage.

2035
01:43:01,961 --> 01:43:03,110
He'll come backstage.
Just mate,

2036
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:04,660
they're calling me the snitch out there,
man.

2037
01:43:04,661 --> 01:43:07,660
I think I'm you.
That poor guy pays for it.

2038
01:43:08,350 --> 01:43:09,810
Um,
we were in teams.

2039
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:11,530
Is scary guy dude.
He's a great dude.

2040
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:14,950
This guy is at the top of his game.
Insecurity.

2041
01:43:15,450 --> 01:43:19,850
Just unbelievable.
I saw him one time in las vegas during a

2042
01:43:19,851 --> 01:43:22,360
fight.
He was sitting on the floor.

2043
01:43:22,870 --> 01:43:26,680
Something's happened in the fight.
The crowd goes fucking bananas and

2044
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:31,800
everybody stands up on the floor.
Steve stands up and just motions sit

2045
01:43:32,621 --> 01:43:34,960
down and the entire fucking section sat
down.

2046
01:43:35,290 --> 01:43:37,720
200 plus people.
I'm like,

2047
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:41,350
if you can,
without even having to touch somebody,

2048
01:43:41,351 --> 01:43:44,170
just stand up by your presence alone and
control something like that.

2049
01:43:44,171 --> 01:43:45,640
I mean,
the best I've ever seen.

2050
01:43:45,641 --> 01:43:48,970
He's legit as it gets.
So are you going to do anything to

2051
01:43:48,971 --> 01:43:49,804
market this?
Well,

2052
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:51,950
that's getting to my story.
It's not marketing,

2053
01:43:51,951 --> 01:43:55,580
but let me finish the story here.
So I'm in chicago this year.

2054
01:43:55,581 --> 01:43:56,930
I think there was a paper view.
You were there,

2055
01:43:56,931 --> 01:43:57,620
right?
Yes.

2056
01:43:57,620 --> 01:44:01,100
So something happened and I was late
getting to the arena and they had cut

2057
01:44:01,101 --> 01:44:03,200
off kind of the loading dock.
I couldn't get to it.

2058
01:44:03,201 --> 01:44:07,910
So I had my oldest daughter with me and
so we're having a walk through where all

2059
01:44:07,911 --> 01:44:11,540
the crowds walking in and you know,
dudes,

2060
01:44:11,541 --> 01:44:14,420
all the golden snitch picture,
golden snitch.

2061
01:44:14,660 --> 01:44:17,660
My daughter's like,
what the fuck's going on?

2062
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:18,890
How old is your daughter?

2063
01:44:18,890 --> 01:44:22,670
So she's 22,
so two days ago,

2064
01:44:22,671 --> 01:44:24,860
christmas morning I'm opening up
presents.

2065
01:44:26,180 --> 01:44:29,410
So I get the presence for my daughters,
the three of them and my middle daughter

2066
01:44:29,411 --> 01:44:33,950
is very artistic and so they create
these cool sculpted beer mugs and

2067
01:44:33,951 --> 01:44:36,890
there's four of them.
One of them's like bald guy brewing

2068
01:44:37,370 --> 01:44:40,730
novitsky something and one of them says
golden snitch brewing company,

2069
01:44:41,210 --> 01:44:44,690
so it's cool looking thing and she,
she drew me a black and white kind of

2070
01:44:44,691 --> 01:44:46,520
rendition of all four,
which I'm gonna hang up.

2071
01:44:46,521 --> 01:44:48,380
Really cool.
So then my girlfriend's there,

2072
01:44:48,381 --> 01:44:50,690
so she hands me the box and she's been
telling me all along.

2073
01:44:50,691 --> 01:44:52,460
She goes,
I got you the best fucking president

2074
01:44:52,670 --> 01:44:54,200
ever in the history of presence.
I'm like,

2075
01:44:54,590 --> 01:44:57,200
the hell is this?
So I opened up the box.

2076
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:04,070
Oh my,
she's got this series of t shirts I

2077
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:05,520
think.
What size are you?

2078
01:45:05,910 --> 01:45:07,200
Large.
Large.

2079
01:45:08,070 --> 01:45:08,731
There we go,
man.

2080
01:45:08,731 --> 01:45:10,710
So you,
since you created it,

2081
01:45:11,130 --> 01:45:13,320
you literally and figuratively have to
wear it.

2082
01:45:13,321 --> 01:45:17,580
Now
this is outrageous.

2083
01:45:17,850 --> 01:45:19,940
So that picture there,
there's some.

2084
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:23,520
Oh,

2085
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:28,340
there we go,
baby ladies.

2086
01:45:28,390 --> 01:45:32,150
Gentlemen,
circle is closed.

2087
01:45:36,350 --> 01:45:40,630
So I posted a boot on this or something
that's picture taken.

2088
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:43,130
King series,
moscow.

2089
01:45:44,230 --> 01:45:46,640
I think I can say this.
Hopefully they'll let me back in,

2090
01:45:46,641 --> 01:45:51,641
but it's out in front of kgb fsp
headquarters through that building in

2091
01:45:51,921 --> 01:45:55,880
the background is kgb.
F has now known as fsb.

2092
01:45:55,940 --> 01:45:58,310
Oh wow.
So yeah.

2093
01:45:58,311 --> 01:46:01,100
So I posted a picture of,
she got me like 20 shirts.

2094
01:46:01,101 --> 01:46:03,410
I put them on a private instagram,
facebook,

2095
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:05,480
everybody in the world like take my
money man.

2096
01:46:05,481 --> 01:46:08,150
Where can I get one of the weigh ins
tomorrow?

2097
01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:13,180
Alright,
you guys created it.

2098
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:15,680
You got to own it now.
I got one for shop too that you can

2099
01:46:15,681 --> 01:46:17,590
throw shops mad at you.
Is he?

2100
01:46:17,630 --> 01:46:18,240
Yeah,
he.

2101
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:20,330
He called you the golden wrap now
changed.

2102
01:46:20,770 --> 01:46:22,280
I thought maybe you haven't been here.
He's.

2103
01:46:22,350 --> 01:46:23,810
He's informed.
Misinformed.

2104
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:24,760
He thinks.
First of all,

2105
01:46:24,820 --> 01:46:27,020
you were an employee of usada.
There you go.

2106
01:46:27,050 --> 01:46:29,270
And that now you're an employee of the
ufc.

2107
01:46:30,020 --> 01:46:32,840
He's misinformed about that and I think
he.

2108
01:46:32,870 --> 01:46:35,120
He likes to call skeptical.
He's skeptical.

2109
01:46:35,121 --> 01:46:38,000
Hippo.
I am skeptical as well,

2110
01:46:38,001 --> 01:46:40,730
but I.
One thing that I've learned from doing

2111
01:46:40,731 --> 01:46:45,731
this podcast over the years is that
there's no fucking way is it's

2112
01:46:46,310 --> 01:46:50,490
impossible to know everything.
It is impossible

2113
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:56,030
and you have to rely on the expertise of
the people who have spent a lifetime

2114
01:46:56,731 --> 01:46:58,650
studying these things.
It's very important.

2115
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:03,660
Here's another thing.
There's no way these people could be

2116
01:47:03,661 --> 01:47:05,600
lying about this and it wouldn't

2117
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:08,330
massively damaged their career going
forward.

2118
01:47:08,331 --> 01:47:11,060
It'd be done.
Someone would find out,

2119
01:47:11,180 --> 01:47:13,490
someone would get to them,
the other scientists,

2120
01:47:13,491 --> 01:47:15,740
without them,
there would be studies done,

2121
01:47:15,741 --> 01:47:17,900
there will be papers done.
The internet would find out about it.

2122
01:47:17,901 --> 01:47:19,910
Everybody would know.
There's no way.

2123
01:47:20,070 --> 01:47:24,620
It's pretty unprecedented in writing
with the lack of these studies that were

2124
01:47:24,621 --> 01:47:26,860
chenko.
One being my sanity even.

2125
01:47:26,861 --> 01:47:27,680
Right.
How do you say it?

2126
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:30,640
Rich chenko the chicken.
It's pretty unprecedented.

2127
01:47:30,641 --> 01:47:32,930
And they would put these absolutes in
writing.

2128
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:34,040
Um,
you know,

2129
01:47:34,041 --> 01:47:35,060
with this,
you know,

2130
01:47:35,061 --> 01:47:38,300
I think they looked at it very hard and
detailed and obviously they weren't

2131
01:47:38,301 --> 01:47:42,050
quick and turning it around and we would
have loved this decision to be made a

2132
01:47:42,051 --> 01:47:45,380
lot earlier so we could have rooted and
vetted out with Nevada.

2133
01:47:45,860 --> 01:47:47,700
But they did indeed,
you know,

2134
01:47:47,770 --> 01:47:51,230
sign their names to these pretty
absolute statements and what,

2135
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:54,110
what else can the ufc and I do,
um,

2136
01:47:54,111 --> 01:47:57,320
when these experts are putting those
absolutes out there and I get the people

2137
01:47:57,321 --> 01:47:57,740
go,
oh,

2138
01:47:57,740 --> 01:47:59,120
whoops,
can you do.

2139
01:47:59,350 --> 01:48:00,790
You got to understand,
folks,

2140
01:48:00,791 --> 01:48:02,950
this would be career suicide.
This is,

2141
01:48:02,970 --> 01:48:07,120
this is the.
This is cutting edge science.

2142
01:48:07,121 --> 01:48:10,750
We're talking about there's too many
people that would have a vested interest

2143
01:48:10,751 --> 01:48:15,490
in calling bullshit.
It's not some you don't fuck around when

2144
01:48:15,491 --> 01:48:18,190
it comes to these things.
The people that are at the,

2145
01:48:18,430 --> 01:48:21,550
the front of the line when it comes to
catching people on these things in the

2146
01:48:21,551 --> 01:48:25,270
science that they're imploring,
they're that they're involved with.

2147
01:48:25,271 --> 01:48:29,560
It's this is not.
You can't like guests on the outside

2148
01:48:29,561 --> 01:48:33,400
with no education.
It's just not wise and this is what I

2149
01:48:33,401 --> 01:48:37,090
keep seeing over and over again is
people that have some knowledge,

2150
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:41,680
a little bit of knowledge and they're
pretending that they are.

2151
01:48:41,710 --> 01:48:43,180
They have a phd in this shit

2152
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:47,020
go.
I mean for those that want to do more

2153
01:48:47,021 --> 01:48:50,650
detective work,
go read mclaren's written decision on

2154
01:48:50,651 --> 01:48:54,670
john's july,
2018 july,

2155
01:48:54,671 --> 01:48:58,960
2018 tests.
Go read the rich hank off study on the

2156
01:48:59,020 --> 01:49:04,020
dhc empty and the metabolites and go
read the recent clomiphene study where

2157
01:49:04,121 --> 01:49:06,340
it shows as chlorinated substance.
It's pulsing,

2158
01:49:06,341 --> 01:49:08,440
it goes away,
comes back higher than before.

2159
01:49:08,470 --> 01:49:09,760
It goes away,
comes back,

2160
01:49:09,761 --> 01:49:10,750
lower,
goes away,

2161
01:49:10,751 --> 01:49:12,190
comes back higher.
Crazy stuff.

2162
01:49:12,910 --> 01:49:14,880
Okay.
We good?

2163
01:49:15,270 --> 01:49:17,020
When?
When can someone get one of these?

2164
01:49:17,950 --> 01:49:20,980
She only made about 15 of them for me.
So man,

2165
01:49:20,981 --> 01:49:24,010
you gotta sell these.
You have to sell these.

2166
01:49:24,280 --> 01:49:27,060
Maybe we do something for maybe do
something for charity or stuff that

2167
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:28,510
jamie.
Yeah.

2168
01:49:28,540 --> 01:49:30,370
Someone needs to stop.
We can talk,

2169
01:49:30,371 --> 01:49:32,680
but then it's not exclusive.
You want to have the exclusive shirt

2170
01:49:32,681 --> 01:49:35,080
where nobody else can get online.
Anything exclusive.

2171
01:49:35,380 --> 01:49:37,660
I'm not into that man.
All right jeff,

2172
01:49:37,930 --> 01:49:40,750
thank you very much.
I appreciate you clarifying.

2173
01:49:40,751 --> 01:49:43,150
Please folks,
please have an open mind.

2174
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:45,070
Please.
I know you want to call bullshit.

2175
01:49:45,700 --> 01:49:47,740
There's times this times to call
bullshit,

2176
01:49:47,741 --> 01:49:47,980
but there's

2177
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:52,180
times to recognize that this is a
complicated issue and that we've laid it

2178
01:49:52,181 --> 01:49:55,030
out as I'm.
I'm pretty convinced.

2179
01:49:55,870 --> 01:49:59,500
Appreciated joe and I'm done so you
might be smarter than me.

2180
01:49:59,590 --> 01:50:00,370
Alright,
bye everybody.
