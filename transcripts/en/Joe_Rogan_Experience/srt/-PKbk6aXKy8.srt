1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,980
We are live.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,840
thank you very much for tuning into the 
podcast.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,280
Once again,
my friend Brian Redman,

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,350
of course,
as always,

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,170
and today joining us the wonderful and 
talented Mr Dane Cook.

6
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,190
Talk Joke.
Chris,

7
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:16,230
before we get going to take our sponsor,
the fleshlight,

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,570
have you ever used one of these things?
I fucked with.

9
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,820
I have not filled.
That is fantastic.

10
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:22,710
Oh my God.
Oh Brian,

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,110
that's our delay in the background.
You guys can't hear it,

12
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:28,790
but my,
uh,

13
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,130
my computer's a volume was on of course,
but this is a sponsor of our show is 

14
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:39,111
supposed to.
There's a little button right in the 

15
00:00:39,111 --> 00:00:39,111
middle.
Brian.

16
00:00:39,111 --> 00:00:42,330
Upper level around background thing.
Upper level.

17
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,310
Is it off?
Okay.

18
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:47,810
Yeah,
it looks like it's tough.

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,010
Powerful.
Anyway,

20
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,570
the idea,
the idea first of all,

21
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:56,571
why the.
Well they offered to sponsor the show 

22
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:56,571
and I said why not,
you know,

23
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:57,990
middle.
But why in the shape of the flash light?

24
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,500
Why is,
why is it a flashlight?

25
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,810
I guess that's it.
So it makes it easier to hold so you can

26
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:04,380
fuck it easier.

27
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,990
Okay.
And then once you're,

28
00:01:05,991 --> 00:01:09,710
once you're done and you ejaculate,
can you open that?

29
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:11,910
Yeah,
that's what I say.

30
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:16,930
Yeah.
You unscrew the bottom and released the 

31
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,680
crack.
It just slithers out no into the sink.

32
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:24,940
It's like something else that it is more
shameful for some reason than 

33
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:24,940
masturbating.
It feels way better,

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,750
but it's more shameful.
Like,

35
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:32,010
like I always joke that as I'm coming,
I'm regretting it as I'm coming on this.

36
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,420
It also serve as a flashlight.
It doesn't light up and cases,

37
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,500
not a flashlight should have a little 
laser pointer or something like that.

38
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,890
Yeah.
It's just a silly little piece of shit 

39
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:45,890
talking about flesh.
That's awesome.

40
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,150
If you want pink and last night you 
performed for pink.

41
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,530
Kind of a fucking shitty segway.
Was that asshole.

42
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,280
How dare you subjected my ears to that.
How was that though?

43
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:56,470
Is that

44
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:01,620
pretty cool?
She called me up and she asked me if I 

45
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,860
would do her a birthday party for her 
boyfriend,

46
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,420
a carey heart,
you know,

47
00:02:04,421 --> 00:02:08,800
the BMX guy and all that and I haven't 
done a private anything in forever.

48
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,030
And I was like,
Nah,

49
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:11,640
I don't know.
I'm a fan and stuff,

50
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:12,640
but it seems weird,
right?

51
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,290
I was like,
I can't do that.

52
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:15,160
And then she was like,
well,

53
00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:15,820
this is what,
you know,

54
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,760
how much I can pay.
And I was like a,

55
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,980
it was actually a few weeks ago when the
deal came together.

56
00:02:20,981 --> 00:02:21,610
I was like,
if you,

57
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,120
if you can do that and get me a court 
side for Lakers,

58
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:26,740
Celtics,
which I thought was impossible.

59
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:32,010
I'm like,
I'm never going to get courtside last 

60
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:32,010
minute for the series.
And she called back.

61
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,491
She goes,
I got court side for the last two games 

62
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:35,491
and I'll,
I'll give you the,

63
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:35,491
uh,
the big that you want.

64
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:37,430
Holy Shit.
Next thing into homesteading there.

65
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,400
It was like,
it was,

66
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,530
it was,
it was the highest paying hell Gig I've 

67
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:44,770
ever done.
It was bizarre.

68
00:02:44,771 --> 00:02:46,390
It was a completely bizarre.
It was weird.

69
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:51,391
How many people were there?
A 75 and they had a pink and Carrie was 

70
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,220
on stage and like thrones that she'd 
gotten him.

71
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,330
And will you,
will you hired?

72
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:56,700
Do your

73
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,000
totally.
Just talk to them and just say hi,

74
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,970
fuck around.
Pretty much could have done anything,

75
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:02,740
but I knew they were fans of like,
you know,

76
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,790
my comedy,
so I was like,

77
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,320
all right,
I want to go in and do well,

78
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:07,510
but by the time I got up there 
everybody's shit phase.

79
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,960
And it felt like the Boston or something
back in New York at like two in the 

80
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:12,960
morning.
Yeah.

81
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,480
Yeah.
Pink lately.

82
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:19,420
Have you.
This thing is like recent shows.

83
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,740
Yeah.
No,

84
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,570
she's,
she's an incredible performer.

85
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,280
Yeah.
I wrote a whole blog about her.

86
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,080
Brian,
why am I not hearing myself?

87
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,400
There we go.
It's just that it was just that.

88
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,500
Just the vine for you.
Yeah,

89
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:30,990
dude,
uh,

90
00:03:30,991 --> 00:03:33,610
I wrote a whole blog about her 
performance at the emmy's that I watched

91
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:35,080
and I was like,
Holy Shit.

92
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,110
Like it was like perfect.
A voice was perfect.

93
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,200
The way she carried herself was perfect.
And then when she actually suspended 

94
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,690
herself and started spinning around like
there's no fucking way.

95
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,940
She's really this good and she's really 
sick.

96
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,070
Yeah.
Really singing the whole time.

97
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,950
And even people on the radio were like,
she was limp sanken.

98
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,330
I don't think she was.

99
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,840
I don't think so.
She wasn't,

100
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,820
she wasn't doing that and seeing anyways
as ridiculous if she really was doing.

101
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,810
She just fell doing that shit.
Yeah,

102
00:03:59,811 --> 00:04:00,870
I saw that video.
Yeah,

103
00:04:00,871 --> 00:04:01,400
yeah,
yeah.

104
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,980
Scariest.
We fell,

105
00:04:03,981 --> 00:04:08,800
but when she fell for wire,
pulled her and pulled it to the very end

106
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:10,730
til it was taught and I thought if that 
snapped,

107
00:04:10,731 --> 00:04:12,110
it could have cut her head off.
Totally.

108
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:17,470
And then it would have been the most 
popular video on how crazy would that 

109
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,481
have been?
Could you imagine watching pink get her 

110
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:21,610
head cut off?
Capitated.

111
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,780
But you imagine if that was a real viral
video.

112
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:29,410
Wow.
And then the sales would go up because 

113
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:29,410
isn't everything posthumous like.
Yeah.

114
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:29,410
Giant.
Huge,

115
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:29,750
huge.
Yeah.

116
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,280
Anytime you die,
even if you were mediocre when you die,

117
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:33,720
you were a little bit better than 
mediocre.

118
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,800
Yeah.
Everybody loves you.

119
00:04:34,801 --> 00:04:36,660
Everybody goes crazy.
Then they're going to hear you again.

120
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:38,250
So they go nuts.
Buy Your Shit.

121
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:40,590
Even though they forgot about you.
Look at Michael Jackson,

122
00:04:40,591 --> 00:04:41,190
who's,
by the way,

123
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,570
incredibly brilliant,
talented,

124
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,760
but after he died,
man,

125
00:04:44,761 --> 00:04:47,520
everybody went fucking nuts.
Everybody went nuts to buy shit.

126
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,050
I thought it was fake for a bit 
actually.

127
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:51,100
Yeah.
Because I'm Kinda like,

128
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,420
I'm always like,
all right,

129
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:54,490
these guys,
she theorist a little bit,

130
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,570
man.
It's like I thought that,

131
00:04:55,571 --> 00:05:00,571
you know,
he'd pop out like six months later 

132
00:05:00,571 --> 00:05:00,790
because he needed something.
He needed the love back man.

133
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:04,120
There was a lot of people that were not 
feeling Michael Jackson for a long time.

134
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:07,330
I don't think anybody's ever even tried 
to pull that death off.

135
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:10,810
I think if you tried to die and I think 
that's a federal crime,

136
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,640
I think if you visit really.
Yeah.

137
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:14,350
I don't think,
I don't think you're allowed to do that,

138
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,140
you know?
I mean even as a publicity stunt,

139
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:22,170
you would have to have medical records 
and if you have medical records and 

140
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:22,170
people are going to find out they don't 
exist.

141
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:22,960
If you're faking it.
True.

142
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,030
I don't think he can do it.

143
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:29,070
The whole Tupac thing.
It's ridiculous how it's gotten that 

144
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:29,070
Elvis too,
man.

145
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,340
So all Elvis back then.
Maybe you could pull it off.

146
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,110
You know,
they killed JFK.

147
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,120
They could probably fuck elvis up.
Well,

148
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:39,121
that was the whole thing is that 
everybody said Elvis faked his death to 

149
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:40,030
get away from the colonel to live a 
normal life because the colonel was like

150
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:45,031
this megalomaniac.
Isn't that hilarious that people are so 

151
00:05:45,031 --> 00:05:47,791
romantic,
they don't realize that when you get to 

152
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:48,340
be Elvis famous,
you are guaranteed fucking insane.

153
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,990
Yeah.
There's no way you can get away from it.

154
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:55,530
Elvis,
this is back before the Internet is 

155
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:55,530
back.
You know,

156
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:55,530
I mean terrible movies.
It was doing.

157
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,190
He couldn't even leave his house,
couldn't even walk down the street.

158
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:03,310
When people would see him,
they would start screaming and fall to 

159
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:03,310
their knees.
Yeah.

160
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,360
My favorite Elvis story that I heard was
at the height of everybody loving and 

161
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:10,070
hating Elvis.
Those buttons came out.

162
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,180
You know,
I love Elvis,

163
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:13,490
and then the I hate Elvis.
Pins came out.

164
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,640
He made those.
The colonel came up with that.

165
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:18,710
They sold more.
I hate Elvis pins.

166
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,220
I've heard of a bunch of people doing 
that or stealing that exact same idea.

167
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:27,270
That's awesome that it's so awesome.
You know Elvis thing must be so sucky.

168
00:06:27,281 --> 00:06:30,280
If you were a dude back then,
how the fuck do you compete with Elvis?

169
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,580
Your girl is screaming and yelling and 
you're fucking her and you know,

170
00:06:33,581 --> 00:06:35,470
she really would way rather be fucking 
Alvin.

171
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,660
All you can really do is just play into 
it and just tell her you love Elvis and 

172
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,830
take her to elvis and like just try to 
make her elvis fantasy come to fruition.

173
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,480
Yeah,
put on the fucking wig.

174
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:46,370
The whole deal.
Mutton chops.

175
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,960
It was elvis,
an elvis clip when he was really.

176
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,560
He was really fucked up.
He was doing whatever drugs he was doing

177
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,640
and he was bored and he was not 
remembering the lyrics and there's a Gig

178
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:59,270
he was doing in Hawaii where he so 
fucking bored and you watch this.

179
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,300
He's not singing any of the lyrics,
varieties just inside jokes with his 

180
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,111
band members and then he does the thing.
Re slowly backs up slowly during this 

181
00:07:08,111 --> 00:07:11,441
one song to his three backup singers and
in the middle of the park he just turns 

182
00:07:11,441 --> 00:07:12,770
and screams in their faces and scares 
the shit out of them.

183
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,040
Like literally turns.
It goes and they're all like,

184
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,600
as they're trying to sing,
he was gone.

185
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,650
He was gone.
He was way too big.

186
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,070
You can't get that big.
It's not,

187
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,170
it's not safe,
vague.

188
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,450
And he was like,
so I,

189
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:31,040
I mean I,
I'm kind of a huge elvis fan and there's

190
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:36,070
one documentary that Priscilla actually 
did years ago based on what she wrote 

191
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,610
where she finally talked about how 
insecure he really wasn't,

192
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:38,990
you know,
he had his buddies like living with them

193
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:43,991
and shit and if they wanted to go out to
a dinner and he was by himself and he 

194
00:07:43,991 --> 00:07:44,570
would freak out,
he would shoot TV's up.

195
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:48,710
He had to have his friends around him.
Twenty four slash seven.

196
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,990
Wow.
Joe,

197
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:54,480
you kind of have that whole entourage.
You want a gang of this?

198
00:07:54,481 --> 00:07:57,410
Have you joe,
you like,

199
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,370
we used to like always roll with huge 
groups of people.

200
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,380
You can't too problematic,
but you prefer that kind of.

201
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:03,940
Well,
it's,

202
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:08,970
it's always more fun to have a bunch of 
guys that you're friends with that like 

203
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,690
go to you and gigs,
but if you have too many and you have to

204
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,430
manage them all,
then it becomes a pain in the ass.

205
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:17,450
It becomes more of a pain in the ass 
with getting my friends to get 

206
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,310
downstairs in time so we can get to the 
fucking show and you know,

207
00:08:18,311 --> 00:08:20,890
did you call this God's wake them up,
we got to go to the fucking airport,

208
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:23,810
where is he?
And there's five different guys and have

209
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,240
got their own bullshit and then dude 
start arguing with each other and then 

210
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,710
it became ugly.
Gonna become like,

211
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:31,030
okay,
this is nonsense.

212
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,020
So I had to cut it.
Most of it.

213
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,210
It was like a reality show for awhile.
It was,

214
00:08:34,211 --> 00:08:35,920
it was too much though.
It was too much like that.

215
00:08:35,921 --> 00:08:36,940
It was,
there was too many people,

216
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:41,970
you know,
when it was taped and Eddie and me and 

217
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,330
you and Larry and Mike Young and all 
these other dudes and we'd all go out.

218
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:43,990
I mean,
come on.

219
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:46,390
That was ridiculous with a giant group 
on the road,

220
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:48,160
man.
Do you want.

221
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:49,280
Do you like to run with a bunch of 
dudes?

222
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,590
You always taught it with your friends?

223
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,720
I kind of,
I pretty much have stuck close with the 

224
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:55,720
same guys that I started,
like my graduating class,

225
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,860
bobby Kelly Bell,
Benny,

226
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,870
you know,
our new bur when I first started and 

227
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,030
patrice,
because we kind of came up like a little

228
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:05,250
bit after you like you were a couple of 
years ahead,

229
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:10,550
headlining around.
I did a bunch of really a fun little 

230
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,660
gigs for Dick already.
The comedy hots.

231
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,130
Remember those comedy gods?
Yeah.

232
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:19,210
The Cambridge did.
We did Victoria's comedy hunting 

233
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,110
monkeys.
Dane was with uh,

234
00:09:20,111 --> 00:09:23,040
a comedy troupe with Bob Kelly and him 
and Benny was so,

235
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,810
it was a good comedy troupe.
You guys were funny.

236
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,950
It was good.
You know,

237
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:30,951
it was interesting.
You would do comedy sketches and then 

238
00:09:30,951 --> 00:09:31,950
you would do like each guy would go up 
and do stand up.

239
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,540
Right.
And so we would work together.

240
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,980
Do these addict already gigs.

241
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,290
Those were fucking fun.
Our sketch comedy Improv group was,

242
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,760
was so bad.
We were so bad at Improv and everybody,

243
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:44,040
you know,
the first rule of Improv is don't deny,

244
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,250
but we were so bad at Improv that our 
first roles was denied,

245
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:53,180
so we were just command and completely 
ruined scenes by like you're pretending 

246
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:53,940
pantomiming I'm holding a baby and you 
can be dude,

247
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:58,020
why are you holding a tire?
It would just fall apart from there,

248
00:09:58,021 --> 00:10:00,060
but we just had a ball.
You guys had some good ones.

249
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,580
You had some good sketches.
It was fun.

250
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,530
I mean it was,
it was experimental.

251
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:09,710
It was like you guys are taking chances 
who were doing something a little 

252
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:09,710
unusual at a comedy club just when you 
were doing comedy too.

253
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,880
Yeah,
that was probably actually better for us

254
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:16,881
opening with our standup and then we'd 
just go fuck around and do music or 

255
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:16,881
skits or Improv or whatever for,
you know,

256
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:16,881
whatever.

257
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:21,830
The rest of the hour to fill it up.
Still ever tried to do improv and once 

258
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,280
in a while or do you just only stand up 
now?

259
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:28,570
I'm a little bit.
I've been bringing al because Al has 

260
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,090
been hosting down at the laugh factory 
and I'll bring it up once in a while and

261
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:31,770
we'll do stuff at the very end just to,
you know,

262
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,800
whatever a skit or dumb and I will do 
some stuff once in a while where I'll 

263
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,670
just bring them up and bad some stuff 
around but not like I used to not like,

264
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:43,700
you know,
sketch full on sketch upright citizens 

265
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:43,700
brigade.
Yeah,

266
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:43,700
yeah,
yeah.

267
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,130
I'm not a sketch guy.
I really rather prefer watching standup.

268
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:48,750
I mean sketches are fun and everything 
like that.

269
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:53,751
But just remember that movie you did,
that little short movie did for Kelly 

270
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,140
Kirsten where you're talking about the 
cable bill and stuff like that.

271
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,180
It's like a five minute clip or 
something like that.

272
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,220
I just pretended to be my dad.
It was really easy.

273
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,320
How did it go from.
I've always wanted to know because you 

274
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,400
were in Boston and you're the first guy 
who we watched go from,

275
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,220
you know,
headlining to then you're on tv man,

276
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,520
and it was like everybody was looking at
you going how to,

277
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,640
how do I do that?
What,

278
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:18,910
like,
how did you turn the corner?

279
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,450
$100 total luck.
Complete.

280
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:22,840
Total luck.
I uh,

281
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,640
was uh,
did mtvs half hour comedy hour and MTV.

282
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,630
Was that Mario Joiner or somebody else 
saying yes and Mario would.

283
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,790
It was like,
I didn't even get to shake his hand,

284
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,240
like he introduces you and he goes to 
the left and you go to the right.

285
00:11:35,241 --> 00:11:35,970
And I was like,
damn,

286
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:40,971
I didn't get to shake my hand.
I felt like it wasn't even really on a 

287
00:11:40,971 --> 00:11:40,971
show,
you know?

288
00:11:40,971 --> 00:11:42,240
It's like Mario joined her back then was
the shit.

289
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,170
That's a guy where I don't understand 
what happened there.

290
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,030
I don't understand what he was.
The shit vanished.

291
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,600
Anthony Clark was the wholesale a 
kamikaze or something like those guys.

292
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,010
But I know Anthony,
I know he's troubled,

293
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:59,010
so I know that's what.
What would lead him to this weird place 

294
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,701
he is now,
but I never understood the Mario Joiner 

295
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:02,701
thing.
Right.

296
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:03,490
Do you remember Reggie Mcfadden?
I do remember is another one,

297
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:06,040
right?
Adam was a monster.

298
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,080
Absolutely.
One of the few guys that I really would 

299
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,080
would be afraid to go on.
Okay.

300
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,290
I used to see him in the early nineties 
in New York and I would watch him do 

301
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:15,290
stand up and I would go,
fuck,

302
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,570
this guy's going to be Eddie Murphy 
who's going to be gigantic.

303
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,310
It's going to be the biggest comic ever,
and then nothing.

304
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,100
It was weird.
It's the weirdest thing ever as he stole

305
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:24,160
even.
Exactly.

306
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,370
Exactly that question right there.
That's hilarious.

307
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:31,371
And charismatic guy,
handsome and well spoken and a fucking 

308
00:12:31,371 --> 00:12:33,450
really nice guy,
like a real nice guy and whenever you're

309
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:34,800
around him,
he's always smiling,

310
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,180
having a good time.
It's like,

311
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,400
what the fuck happened?
How does this not work?

312
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:44,990
It's a very strange thing.
It's a very strange thing and it's a 

313
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,361
very strange thing when guys get angry 
that for some reason or another they 

314
00:12:47,361 --> 00:12:49,410
don't get the respect that they deserve.
That is one of my pet peeves.

315
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,690
That's a weird thing when people do 
that.

316
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,850
Well it's because,
I mean,

317
00:12:52,851 --> 00:12:54,560
I can't speak for Reggie,
but it's like,

318
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,700
you know,
you,

319
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,640
you go through this phase or period and 
standup where you're like,

320
00:12:58,641 --> 00:13:00,590
okay,
I've committed my life to this.

321
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:02,350
This is what I want to do.
I've,

322
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,130
you know,
I'm all in here at the table.

323
00:13:04,131 --> 00:13:04,850
I'm in my,
for me,

324
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:09,851
my mid twenties,
there's no turning back now and there's 

325
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:10,490
a bunch of those years where you're 
watching people go on,

326
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:11,690
you know,
some people are getting stuff,

327
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:15,160
some people are falling off and it 
freaks you the hell out.

328
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:15,480
Man.

329
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:20,710
It freaks you out hard.
But I don't think it's a very healthy 

330
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,861
attitude at all to look at someone 
else's success as if somehow or another 

331
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:23,861
it's bad for you.
You know?

332
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:25,100
And I think if some,
if you're not,

333
00:13:25,101 --> 00:13:30,101
if,
if someone's not paying attention to 

334
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:30,101
you,
like there's a lot of dudes that like,

335
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:30,101
you know,
I don't feel like my,

336
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:30,890
my advocates or respect that it 
deserves.

337
00:13:30,891 --> 00:13:33,500
Like he gets the exact respect it 
deserves.

338
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:38,590
There's no other way around it.
It's the perfect connection between you 

339
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,020
and an audience.
And if it's not getting a reaction,

340
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:44,140
it's because of one of two things.
Either you've been very shitty and 

341
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,020
marketing yourself and,
or promoting yourself or your.

342
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,860
You're not seeing it the way other 
people are seeing it.

343
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,240
You haven't found your audience and 
there's some people that have weird acts

344
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:50,840
like,
you know,

345
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,940
Mitch Hedberg for the longest time had a
really hard time on the road because he 

346
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,341
would go on and they would put on these 
like super high energy middle acts that 

347
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:00,341
would sing.

348
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:01,930
And like,
I remember there's this black dude in,

349
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,530
oh,
I believe it was in Ohio,

350
00:14:03,531 --> 00:14:04,570
I think it was at the,
uh,

351
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,760
the funny bone and Columbus and Hedberg 
was supposed to headline and this guy 

352
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,980
was fucking crushing air every night in 
the middle spot with singing and dancing

353
00:14:12,981 --> 00:14:15,440
and getting those Columbus,
Ohio people into it.

354
00:14:15,441 --> 00:14:17,060
And then Hedberg would just,
you know,

355
00:14:17,061 --> 00:14:19,100
your folks who's from there,
you know,

356
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,540
it's what it is.
That's your peeps.

357
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:25,930
They're good people.
That's where I recorded my special 

358
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:25,930
there.
But he would,

359
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:26,340
he would go out to them and they would 
hate him.

360
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,290
He would hate him.

361
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,780
What was he in that face to remember?
You just grow up and kind of.

362
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:34,950
He would stand there for a while and his
hair were just completely be covering 

363
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,070
his face,
like not even looking up the glasses,

364
00:14:36,071 --> 00:14:38,890
nothing.
He was just like the top of his head and

365
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:43,570
how do you go up after somebody is 
fucking juggling chainsaws,

366
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,070
which is hilarious by the way.

367
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,490
Yeah,
it is a weird thing,

368
00:14:47,491 --> 00:14:52,491
right?
He had a fine his audience and he had a 

369
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,300
real hard time with that a long time.
That's always a tricky thing,

370
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:54,650
man,
when you're coming up in the beginning,

371
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:59,651
like there's guys who will tailor their 
material or tailor their act where they 

372
00:14:59,651 --> 00:15:01,220
don't want to do this,
but they do it just so that they can get

373
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:04,490
more people liking them and they can get
like on a better track.

374
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,130
You know what I'm talking about?
Yeah.

375
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,700
Yeah.
There's that,

376
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,870
that's like,
that's like a real.

377
00:15:08,871 --> 00:15:10,260
It's like,
it's so hard to fucking.

378
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,550
Especially when you don't have an 
audience to really find your own voice.

379
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,830
You know,
it's so tricky because you know,

380
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,570
you'll work at a club and if you offend 
someone,

381
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:18,120
I feel like,
you know,

382
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,840
my act was always kind of dirty and 
offensive and like,

383
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:22,220
you know,
when I was nobody,

384
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,960
like they would get upset at me.
Like you just,

385
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:25,370
there's three people that want their 
money back,

386
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,630
fucking asshole,
you know,

387
00:15:26,631 --> 00:15:28,010
clean up your act for the next show and 
you're like,

388
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,290
wow,
clean up.

389
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,010
My Act.
Like this is what I like to do,

390
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,840
this is the stuff that I always like to 
see.

391
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:35,030
Like I can't talk about what I think is 
actually funny.

392
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,110
So when you're doing your stand up and 
you,

393
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,260
you did finally leave Boston and hit the
road where,

394
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,700
where did the news radio thing finally

395
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:46,490
mtv thing and I got a development deal 
right out of it with Fox to do a show 

396
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,610
called hardball.
This terrible shows really bad,

397
00:15:48,611 --> 00:15:51,370
but you know,
a bunch of good guys on it and I had fun

398
00:15:51,371 --> 00:15:53,350
but it was like I don't want to be run 
actors and even when I'm like,

399
00:15:53,351 --> 00:15:58,351
this is just to grow.
So I would go back to New York and go 

400
00:15:58,351 --> 00:16:00,271
back to comedy,
but I fucked up and already got an 

401
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:00,271
apartment because I thought the show was
gonna.

402
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:01,560
Everybody thinks their show is going to 
go though the ratings are good.

403
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,520
Were picked up for next year,
you know,

404
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:08,521
everybody thinks that show is so.
My stupid ass got this fucking cool ass 

405
00:16:08,521 --> 00:16:08,890
apartment.
And I was like,

406
00:16:08,891 --> 00:16:09,850
all right,
now I'm stuck.

407
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,300
So then right after that I got a deal 
with NBC and before I know when I was on

408
00:16:13,301 --> 00:16:18,301
news radio,
it was just like stumbled into one 

409
00:16:18,301 --> 00:16:18,301
thing.

410
00:16:18,301 --> 00:16:18,760
I mean audition for news radio.
But uh,

411
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:24,570
it was kind of funny because one of the 
reasons why they liked me for the part 

412
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,230
was that there was no jokes in the 
script.

413
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:31,330
Right?
Like the first one that gave out there 

414
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:31,330
was no,
it wasn't no comedy in it.

415
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:31,330
It was just like really straight and 
flat.

416
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,470
And I was like,
wow,

417
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:33,820
I don't know how the fuck do I play 
this?

418
00:16:33,821 --> 00:16:38,821
I was like,
I'm just gonna play it as if I was 

419
00:16:38,821 --> 00:16:38,821
really saying it,
like,

420
00:16:38,821 --> 00:16:38,821
let me just go and do it.
This is,

421
00:16:38,821 --> 00:16:39,370
there's no jokes in here.
So I don't know what they're doing.

422
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,320
They were just trying to weed out the 
hacks.

423
00:16:41,321 --> 00:16:46,321
They were trying to read out the.
We were trying to weed out exploding 

424
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:47,170
shoe guys.
I guess so.

425
00:16:47,171 --> 00:16:48,910
It just got lucky.
It's total luck.

426
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,050
Total luck,
right person,

427
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,130
right place,
right time,

428
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:51,910
click,
click,

429
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:52,270
click.

430
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,760
All of a sudden I'm on TV,
which was fun,

431
00:16:54,761 --> 00:16:59,761
but in the beginning when I was on TV,
I I've very shitty with writing new 

432
00:16:59,761 --> 00:17:02,170
material and W I wasn't performing that 
much.

433
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,500
I was just loving the fact that I was 
making all this money and just having 

434
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,730
fun and doing stupid shit and just no 
discipline at all.

435
00:17:09,731 --> 00:17:11,590
And saving up for your first incredible 
car.

436
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,970
I bought the first car right away.
Soon as,

437
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,120
as soon as I had money,
I bought a 1994 Toyota super turbo.

438
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,450
Had One of those to do those with the 
shits.

439
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,900
Used that fucking big crazy wing in the 
bank.

440
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,240
Literally a spaceship.
I loved it.

441
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,500
Loved it.
Was my first really cool car.

442
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,520
I think I went a 85 Mustang gt with the 
tee tops digit charcoal gray.

443
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,850
She was abused.

444
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,630
It's nice.
Yeah,

445
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,720
it's a.
there's something fucking cool about 

446
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,150
buying your first cool shit.
I bought a pool cue for $7,000,

447
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,690
but this Ernie,
Ernie cutera's,

448
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,990
this guy in la,
it makes us Cuculla Gina Q,

449
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,310
Right.
Homemade,

450
00:17:50,311 --> 00:17:53,220
like really like precise,
perfectly balanced pool cue.

451
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,570
It's like this thing's called

452
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:59,810
seven can collect anything.
Do you have anything that you'd like 

453
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:00,400
spend money on?
You get the.

454
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,120
I know we both get Steve Martin junk.
We both collect Steve Martin.

455
00:18:04,121 --> 00:18:05,040
Stuff like a bunch of members.

456
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,250
Yeah.
Yeah.

457
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,830
I went back and found a whole bunch of 
old vinyls,

458
00:18:08,831 --> 00:18:13,510
Lenny Bruce and cosby and new heart and 
a Steve Martin and stuff.

459
00:18:13,511 --> 00:18:18,511
So that was kind of my thing.
Like I like finding stuff that that's 

460
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:19,720
off the beaten path as opposed to like,
all right,

461
00:18:19,721 --> 00:18:22,750
anybody can go.
I think for me the craziest car I did an

462
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:24,190
Aston Martin.
Oh yeah.

463
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:29,280
And I thought okay,
I spent a quarter of a million dollars 

464
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,410
on this car,
was going to be the fucking craziest.

465
00:18:29,411 --> 00:18:34,411
Got the best car ever.
And it really ended up being the worst 

466
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:34,411
thing that I ever bought with my money.

467
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:38,970
Dude,
I had the exact same story with Porsche 

468
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,280
nine slash 11 turbo.
I bought a nine slash 11 turbo and it 

469
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,521
broke down on me,
literally broke down where it needed a 

470
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:44,521
tow truck five times in three years.

471
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:46,110
I think I drove you three times.
Did I dealer?

472
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:48,690
Just me.
I've spent A.

473
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:53,690
I was there like nine different that we 
were complaining to the fucking crap.

474
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,650
The crap.
A Lexus

475
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,710
never fucks up.
Never.

476
00:18:57,711 --> 00:18:59,300
Never fucked a bulletproof.
Yeah.

477
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,590
Yeah.
They make them so well.

478
00:19:00,591 --> 00:19:05,591
There's never any problems,
but if you have a Mercedes or a porsche 

479
00:19:05,591 --> 00:19:08,801
or something like that,
you're going to have some weird light 

480
00:19:08,801 --> 00:19:08,801
goes off.
Like,

481
00:19:08,801 --> 00:19:08,801
what the fuck is this?
This isn't working.

482
00:19:08,801 --> 00:19:10,430
Why is my headlights not coming on?
Shit.

483
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:15,850
You got to bring it in.
Close the computer and I bought one in 

484
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:15,850
windows 95 on those things.

485
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,530
The Aston Martin and then I bought the 
Casino Royale Soundtrack.

486
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,710
Can I just fucking drove up and I 
pretended I was a spy.

487
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:29,330
He was pointing at people on the side of
the road and pretending I was shooting 

488
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,891
them and like too much time on your 
hands is a problem with those cards is 

489
00:19:32,501 --> 00:19:34,210
when they work.
They're intoxicating.

490
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,840
You know,
when you hear the sound of the engine,

491
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:40,920
that fucking powerful,
like well engineered engine,

492
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,920
but it was such a poorly crafted car 
inside that.

493
00:19:44,921 --> 00:19:47,020
I was like,
why don't I just get a fucking ring tone

494
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:52,050
of that sound and be happy with the 
fucking side of the engine and get rid 

495
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,280
of this plastic piece of shit ass.
Everything inside was crap.

496
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,720
It's in an English car,
right?

497
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,160
Yeah.
They've never been known for really 

498
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,160
making great cars mean Jaguar,
I guess.

499
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,840
Yeah,
but the engine,

500
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:06,870
you're right,
it was worth a fuck up to before Ford 

501
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:06,870
bottom,
right?

502
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:06,870
Yeah,
yeah,

503
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:07,720
yeah.
English.

504
00:20:07,721 --> 00:20:09,340
You don't want that.
You want Japanese.

505
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,500
They don't fuck a product.
Problem is.

506
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:14,710
It's like everything's made by robots 
now for the most part,

507
00:20:14,711 --> 00:20:18,060
so even American made by the same robot.
Not the same though.

508
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,540
It's the standards that you engineered.

509
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,120
That's what's important and they're,
they're.

510
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:26,170
They're using much higher standards than
American car companies are.

511
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,250
There's no doubt about it.
I have a Ford Mustang and I have a BMW m

512
00:20:30,251 --> 00:20:35,251
three,
and the difference between them is so 

513
00:20:35,251 --> 00:20:37,381
different.
It's Ford as high level as far as 

514
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:37,381
American cars go.
It's better than gm,

515
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:38,110
but it's still.
You're inside of it.

516
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:42,230
It just feels fucking Chincy and things 
feel goofy and they don't.

517
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,700
The navigation system kind of sucks.
It was like is engineered by an American

518
00:20:45,701 --> 00:20:48,490
guy and was just kind of.
Whereas the Lexis,

519
00:20:48,491 --> 00:20:50,880
it's like everything,
right?

520
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,250
Yeah.
Let's fucking do this.

521
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:58,270
Modern complained about cars.
How sad also had the cast of all time 

522
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,630
we've had.
We've had

523
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:04,670
nothing is.
Well that's the thing is you can 

524
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,381
actually,
you can sit here and you can tell these 

525
00:21:06,381 --> 00:21:06,870
stories if you've been fortunate enough 
to have some success because anybody who

526
00:21:06,871 --> 00:21:09,540
knows who's done this for a living when 
it's bad,

527
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,390
it's fucking bad.
When it's empty.

528
00:21:12,391 --> 00:21:14,040
It is at its emptiness,
man.

529
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,350
So you know,
you get a little something or you have a

530
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,360
few years of fond that I think it's to

531
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,590
cool to be able to kill.
It doesn't seem real to me.

532
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,330
You know,
success and money.

533
00:21:21,331 --> 00:21:22,800
None of it seems real to me.
You know,

534
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,660
when I can go to the store and just buy 
things.

535
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,380
Yeah.
Oh look,

536
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,970
that TV looks like it would be perfect 
right there.

537
00:21:26,971 --> 00:21:31,971
Let's just get this thing and it can be 
a piece of plastic and you give me 

538
00:21:31,971 --> 00:21:31,971
whatever you got.
Yeah,

539
00:21:31,971 --> 00:21:32,980
it's ridiculous.
I've never real.

540
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,950
It is.
It's crazy fake,

541
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,650
doesn't it say I to walk around your 
house?

542
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:42,830
I know you don't smoke pot,
but when I do I'll walk around my house 

543
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,340
high and I'll just look at the house.
I'll just call.

544
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,900
What the fuck is this like,
um,

545
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,640
this is my house is where I live.
This is so strange.

546
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:52,820
Like why you think about what it was 
like when you first started making money

547
00:21:52,951 --> 00:21:54,600
and you didn't have to worry about bills
anymore.

548
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,380
You know,
that feeling.

549
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,350
That's the fucking most liberating 
feeling ever.

550
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,930
That's the big feeling.
It's not being famous,

551
00:22:00,931 --> 00:22:05,931
not being rich.
The liberating feeling is not have to 

552
00:22:05,931 --> 00:22:06,120
worry about paying your bills.
That's the most important one.

553
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,950
It was like,
wow.

554
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,810
It was like all of a sudden it just like
lifted.

555
00:22:09,811 --> 00:22:12,120
Like I literally physically felt 
lighter.

556
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,970
I'll never forget it because I was 
always scratch and it was always like,

557
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:20,210
do this John Schuler Gig and maybe I'll 
have enough money for rent and then you 

558
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:20,700
know,
I can't eat tonight because I,

559
00:22:20,701 --> 00:22:22,170
you know,
I literally don't have any money.

560
00:22:22,171 --> 00:22:24,270
I have to wait until tomorrow.
And my check cleared.

561
00:22:24,271 --> 00:22:24,310
Yeah.

562
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:29,630
Down still owes you a of chats.
Was the big one especially imagined.

563
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,090
Yeah.
Yeah.

564
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,880
He still owes me 300 bucks from one of 
those.

565
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,650
Really those,

566
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,790
that was brutal for people that didn't,
don't know what we're talking about.

567
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:42,791
There was a time where there was another
entity that he had called New York 

568
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:42,791
entertainment,
right.

569
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:46,010
And they were booking colleges and 
apparently it was costing too much money

570
00:22:46,011 --> 00:22:51,011
to rent the building where they were at 
and they were spending more money than 

571
00:22:51,011 --> 00:22:54,311
they were making.
So they started spending the comedians 

572
00:22:54,311 --> 00:22:54,740
money and owing it to literally like you
would,

573
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,240
you would go to the Gig,
you would fly around the country.

574
00:22:57,241 --> 00:22:59,210
You go to these colleges,
get your checks,

575
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:04,330
send them into Barre and then you know,
you would wait and then you build like a

576
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:04,640
month later.
But like,

577
00:23:04,641 --> 00:23:06,080
what the fuck dude,
where's my money?

578
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:11,081
This is getting crazy.
And then it would be like another time 

579
00:23:11,081 --> 00:23:11,081
you would do it like three or four 
times.

580
00:23:11,081 --> 00:23:12,200
There was guys that had like,
they had a lot of money out.

581
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,840
I don't know how it all got settled,
but it was ugly.

582
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:15,860
It didn't

583
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,960
do it around that 300.
And I'm like,

584
00:23:22,961 --> 00:23:25,210
no,
it's my good luck charm is not paying.

585
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,230
I have the,
I'll show him fucking theory going.

586
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,220
But I know for me man,
like seriously,

587
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:35,770
it's like what put things in perspective
and people,

588
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,750
some people know this or don't you know,
I,

589
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,450
I hired my step brother,
my half brother.

590
00:23:40,451 --> 00:23:41,290
Yeah,
I know that story.

591
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:42,670
That's a crazy story.
And it was like,

592
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,410
all right,
so I thought I had this great nest egg.

593
00:23:44,411 --> 00:23:45,680
I bought a house,
I did all that.

594
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:46,040
And then he

595
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,200
came in and you know,
I can't talk too much about.

596
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:49,010
It's ongoing,
but

597
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,680
we're gonna be talking about it since 
you can't.

598
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:54,460
So the rumor is you don't have to say 
anything that he stole like $11,000,000

599
00:23:54,461 --> 00:23:56,440
from you.
That's fucking hard.

600
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,680
Five years you think that your fucking 
brother,

601
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,920
your beloved,
like someone you grow up with is so 

602
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,041
fucking jealous and so shifty and 
plotting against you that they'll steal 

603
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,400
your fucking money,
allegedly,

604
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,130
allegedly had been such a betrayal.

605
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,610
That's it,
man.

606
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,410
It really was.
First of all,

607
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:19,160
absolutely complete betrayal and the way
I deal with that with my family,

608
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:24,340
but the thing that really was jarring in
the best possible ways was talking 

609
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:25,400
about,
okay,

610
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,340
I've been doing standup for.
I been doing standup for 20 years.

611
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,360
Um,
you know,

612
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,410
when,
when everything happened,

613
00:24:30,411 --> 00:24:33,260
I started in 1990 and then I looked and 
I was like,

614
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,400
alright,
this is gone.

615
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,860
I never had this either it was gone or 
whatever.

616
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,020
I went back on tour.
I did probably the biggest tour that I,

617
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,030
I'll ever do last year I did 80 arenas.
I went out there and fucking just,

618
00:24:44,031 --> 00:24:44,750
you know,
it was hammered.

619
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,010
Yeah,
the economy was Shitty,

620
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:51,011
but I kept going.
I was promoting my fans came out and it 

621
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:51,011
was that I haven't had a moment in a lot
of years.

622
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:55,781
We're really struggling.
Really struggling again where you're 

623
00:24:55,781 --> 00:24:59,021
like,
I'm in trouble if I don't do something 

624
00:24:59,021 --> 00:24:59,480
and the ride is over,
what do I have left,

625
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,720
what's there for me years down the line,
and I was really thankful that the fans 

626
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,930
came out and support it,
but it was that moment where I'm going,

627
00:25:05,931 --> 00:25:06,620
okay,
you know,

628
00:25:06,621 --> 00:25:11,621
yeah,
I bought some cool shit in my life and 

629
00:25:11,621 --> 00:25:11,621
I've collected some album Israel,
you know,

630
00:25:11,621 --> 00:25:15,580
buy something crazy or tomorrow,
but you can't fucking take somebody's 

631
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:15,580
creativity.

632
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:15,580
It,
it always comes back.

633
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,420
You'll have stuff you'll lose.
I've had things,

634
00:25:17,421 --> 00:25:22,421
I've lost it many times in my life and 
all you can do is keep getting back on 

635
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:24,370
stage or fucking getting out there and 
doing whatever you know,

636
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:25,700
connects you to something.

637
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:26,920
Yeah.
Yeah.

638
00:25:26,921 --> 00:25:30,250
That's what it is really for comics to.
It's putting the new thing together,

639
00:25:30,251 --> 00:25:30,970
right?
Yeah.

640
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,190
Sweating that new chunk and then the new
sat and you know,

641
00:25:34,191 --> 00:25:39,191
preparing for the next special and 
feeling these new bits come alive and 

642
00:25:39,191 --> 00:25:41,110
the tags and the new tags,
like what a burst you get every time you

643
00:25:41,111 --> 00:25:44,160
come up with a new tag.
It's like this positive energy charged,

644
00:25:44,161 --> 00:25:46,000
like Ah,
look at it,

645
00:25:46,001 --> 00:25:51,001
and then sometimes on stage in the 
moment you'll pause and say the perfect 

646
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:54,370
shit out of nowhere and destroys and 
that becomes the closer.

647
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,400
I mean,
that becomes the part of the bit that 

648
00:25:59,400 --> 00:25:59,400
ends the bit

649
00:25:59,400 --> 00:25:59,400
best feeling on earth man.
Really,

650
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,500
when it all starts to come together,
you see that,

651
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:01,060
you know,
you know,

652
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:06,070
it's like you have a theme or through 
line that starts to come through and 

653
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:06,070
there nothing better in the world,
man

654
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:06,420
in,
in,

655
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,800
in,
right from the bat,

656
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,840
right from the get go.
When you have your first good set,

657
00:26:09,841 --> 00:26:14,841
you become a junkie for that feeling.
You become someone who needs to kill.

658
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,780
You need to get up there and killed and 
you don't want to do any new.

659
00:26:18,781 --> 00:26:20,340
You don't want to fuck around and do any
new shit.

660
00:26:20,341 --> 00:26:25,341
That's the problem in the beginning 
because you're scared and you want to 

661
00:26:25,341 --> 00:26:26,160
make sure you get through the set good 
and you just just do this stuff that you

662
00:26:26,161 --> 00:26:27,720
know is going to work.
Don't fuck around,

663
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:28,540
don't fuck around.
Right?

664
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:31,570
And said hampers your growth because you
become this fucking junkie.

665
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,440
You just want that charge.
Just want to hear them scream.

666
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,920
You want to hear?
Oh Shit,

667
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,130
no.
But we,

668
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,510
we also,
you know,

669
00:26:39,511 --> 00:26:42,570
we came out of Boston where,
you know,

670
00:26:42,571 --> 00:26:43,510
I know the,
that I can.

671
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,220
I mean I loved,

672
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:49,250
I love Steve Martin and the guys that I 
always loved just watching growing up 

673
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,790
that I wanted to emulate.
And then when I started in Boston,

674
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,040
these guys were like,
killers,

675
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:53,340
man.

676
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:58,380
What people don't understand about 
Boston is everybody knows all these 

677
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:58,590
famous guys.
Everybody knows billy crystal.

678
00:26:58,591 --> 00:27:00,000
Everybody knows,
you know,

679
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:02,280
I mean in the very good comics,
Robert Klein,

680
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,810
but I blah blah blah.
Name the guy.

681
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,520
Don Gavin was better than all of them.
Yeah.

682
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,200
He was better than all of them.
And this is,

683
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,820
this is not an exaggeration.
And he was fucking squeaky clean.

684
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:12,890
I mean,
every now and then he said,

685
00:27:12,891 --> 00:27:13,650
fuck,
fuck,

686
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,780
fuck.
A little less than that.

687
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,070
But that his bits,
we're not dirty.

688
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,980
It was.
Delivery was perfect.

689
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,910
It was perfect.
He would watch his economy of words,

690
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,630
the way he set a sentence up and you 
would just feel humbled.

691
00:27:27,631 --> 00:27:28,440
You would be like,
fuck,

692
00:27:28,441 --> 00:27:30,450
he's a master.
He's a master,

693
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:35,040
but he got caught up in this Boston 
thing where there's all these great guys

694
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:38,550
in this one area and they always drew a 
crowd and they always got paid well,

695
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,160
and then they would go on the road and 
they'd be nobody's.

696
00:27:40,161 --> 00:27:41,430
They'd be like,
why would it be a fucking nobody?

697
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,130
We've got a about back in Boston.
Next thing you know,

698
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:49,131
they're back in Boston and they're just 
doing the same gigs over and over again 

699
00:27:49,131 --> 00:27:51,831
when everybody else takes a shot and 
branches off and disappears and becomes 

700
00:27:51,831 --> 00:27:51,831
famous

701
00:27:51,831 --> 00:27:55,770
and it.
But you really would watch these guys 

702
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:55,790
and part of you would feel bad that they
weren't getting over the hump,

703
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:00,200
but you felt like so fucking honored to 
be opening up and standing,

704
00:28:00,201 --> 00:28:02,060
watching going,
I'm learning from the best.

705
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,020
When you leave Boston,
it's like you had that.

706
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:11,290
These were guys like.
I always describe it like they had the 

707
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:11,290
energy of showman,
but they were like men.

708
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,650
They were men.
Doing comedy?

709
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,640
Yes,
yes.

710
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,570
And I,
you know,

711
00:28:14,571 --> 00:28:19,571
I always really wanted to be there.
They always stood right at the fucking 

712
00:28:19,571 --> 00:28:20,390
front of the stage or re Lenny Clarke is
the perfect example of that.

713
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,220
When Lenny's a fucking man,
he's a guy.

714
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,280
This is what Lindy Clark said was we 
were at giggles and Sagas and there was 

715
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,640
this fucking table full of chicks.
They wouldn't shut the fuck up.

716
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,320
They were screaming and yelling.
He goes,

717
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,480
listen,
if you don't shut the fuck up,

718
00:28:33,481 --> 00:28:35,760
I'm going to hire a Nigga.
Fuck you in front of your mother.

719
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:42,960
What the fuck did he just say?
Me and it was me.

720
00:28:42,961 --> 00:28:45,210
I think Chris Mcguire was there.
I think it was me and Chris.

721
00:28:45,211 --> 00:28:47,910
I can't remember if we were like,
what the fuck did he just say?

722
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:51,810
He doesn't give a fuck.
Buddy Clark did not give a fuck.

723
00:28:51,811 --> 00:28:56,040
He was just this big,
gigantic burly guy who would,

724
00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:01,070
by the way,
he would beat your ass to who this is 

725
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:01,290
like if you like talk shit to Lenny car,
he'll probably,

726
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:02,890
you know,
do a line and punch in the face.

727
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,950
These were real like real hardcore blue 
collar guys,

728
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,710
but layering area.

729
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:12,110
It made us.
It made us sharper because you were held

730
00:29:12,111 --> 00:29:15,800
up to a much higher standard.
You had to go on after guys who were way

731
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:19,160
better than average and you had a.
You had to be sharp all the time.

732
00:29:19,161 --> 00:29:24,161
You had a.
You had to constantly reassess your 

733
00:29:24,161 --> 00:29:24,161
material.

734
00:29:24,161 --> 00:29:26,330
You did it.
I learned a lot watching joe before us 

735
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,260
because the thing that happened with you
though was you were the first guy that I

736
00:29:28,261 --> 00:29:31,740
saw from the next young generation that 
when you started headlining,

737
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,560
you were getting the respect for,
for killing,

738
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:39,860
but you were the first guy that I saw 
that had real backlash ever in my life 

739
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,010
that people were like,
they didn't know how to,

740
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:44,050
where to put them and people that he'd 
passed.

741
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,430
Nope.
Not going to mention names,

742
00:29:45,431 --> 00:29:50,431
but like they were just so fucking 
frustrated and they didn't know how to 

743
00:29:50,431 --> 00:29:50,620
deal with like,
okay,

744
00:29:50,621 --> 00:29:51,260
wait a minute.
This is an,

745
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,230
this is the next guy coming up.

746
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,180
There's that.
You know,

747
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,690
people are always going to resent and 
you're young.

748
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,680
Good looking in every fucking chicken.
The crowd after the show is just like,

749
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:02,850
you know,
there's that,

750
00:30:02,851 --> 00:30:05,220
there's the fighting thing too,
which doesn't make any sense at all.

751
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:10,221
It's not supposed to.
They're not supposed to coincide 

752
00:30:10,221 --> 00:30:10,221
together.
The martial arts thing,

753
00:30:10,221 --> 00:30:11,220
it just seems like I'm,
I'm not the,

754
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,450
I'm not,
I'm not in the club.

755
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,200
You know,
and I mean that's what it felt like to 

756
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,761
me.
People are always going to be backlash 

757
00:30:19,761 --> 00:30:19,761
when whenever anyone successful,
I don't have to tell you that.

758
00:30:19,761 --> 00:30:21,930
Oh yeah.
And I didn't fight,

759
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,700
which makes it even tougher.
You know,

760
00:30:23,701 --> 00:30:27,300
people are always looking for some 
reason why you're fucked up when you are

761
00:30:27,301 --> 00:30:32,301
more successful than them.
They're always looking for some reason 

762
00:30:32,301 --> 00:30:32,301
why it's them,
you know,

763
00:30:32,301 --> 00:30:33,390
to you and not them.
You know,

764
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,250
people get upset or other people's 
success,

765
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,270
you know,
and you could feel it,

766
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:37,390
you know,
I mean,

767
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,830
I got hate mail when I was on fear 
factor every day.

768
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,260
There's no getting around it.
You're always going to get someone who's

769
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:47,220
fucking mad at you about this,
that or you don't deserve this,

770
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:50,220
or you're short or you're bald,
or it's just constant.

771
00:30:50,221 --> 00:30:54,340
People you don't even know just wanna 
before the Internet with that.

772
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:58,170
That even exists though.
The Internet's just hate it.

773
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,000
Well,
it's not that the Internet is,

774
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:02,010
hey dude,
the internet is an outward expression of

775
00:31:02,011 --> 00:31:07,011
how people feel.
People are frustrated and angry and you 

776
00:31:07,011 --> 00:31:07,011
know,
look,

777
00:31:07,011 --> 00:31:10,980
we've been shown that we live in a place
where we have a fake economy that is 

778
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:15,651
recognized as fake by everybody,
but we're still pretending that it's 

779
00:31:15,651 --> 00:31:15,651
real.
We print up money.

780
00:31:15,651 --> 00:31:16,540
Nobody understands where it all goes.
Everybody's fuck.

781
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,510
The banks are making billions.
We don't know how,

782
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:23,710
you know,
there's a lot of frustration and anger 

783
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,791
in this world and if you're anonymous,
you fucking mcfuck stick on the Rogan 

784
00:31:25,791 --> 00:31:27,000
board and it was decided to be a cunt.
You know,

785
00:31:27,001 --> 00:31:28,520
it's just so easy to lash out.
You know,

786
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,240
Dane Cook and suck my Dick.
You know,

787
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,370
I,
I asked for questions and of course most

788
00:31:32,371 --> 00:31:35,460
people like on my message board,
most people real cool shit.

789
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:37,170
There are some interesting questions for
you,

790
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,690
but there was a few,
there were just so fucking douchey.

791
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:45,110
No,
you're never going to get away from 

792
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,110
that.

793
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,710
Those are people too that they really 
want so badly to perpetuate a moment or 

794
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:50,080
something because they want to see the 
fucking battle.

795
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,690
They want to see the battle and there's 
also this thing where they don't want to

796
00:31:52,691 --> 00:31:55,420
see anybody ever forgiven for anything 
and they might have done in the past,

797
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,500
right.
Because they can't.

798
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,360
Yeah,
they can't.

799
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:57,730
Yeah.

800
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,170
And that makes it okay that they can't 
if you can't or we can.

801
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:06,730
Yeah.
I out last year on a couple of cans 

802
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:06,730
back,
but yeah,

803
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:06,730
no,
totally.

804
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:07,690
It's,
you know,

805
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:12,930
there's,
there's just a lot of people in this 

806
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:12,930
world that not just,
they don't just feel shitty,

807
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,220
but they're lashing out.
They lash out at other people.

808
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,890
They do it for no reason.
Like I can imagine like see,

809
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:21,460
like if you don't like a movie,
like I saw a serious man last night.

810
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,800
It was fucking terrible.
Why would you watch that?

811
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,170
Like all these stars on it.
Five stars.

812
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,050
I.
Dude,

813
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,410
I didn't.
I didn't go to rotten tomatoes.

814
00:32:29,411 --> 00:32:34,411
I should've.
It was a Coen brothers movie too and I 

815
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:34,411
love the Coen brothers and there's some 
really interesting parts in it,

816
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:35,650
but there was a part of the and where I 
was like,

817
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:36,880
oh my God,
it ended.

818
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:38,440
It just ended it just like,
okay,

819
00:32:38,441 --> 00:32:41,200
now the movie's over out of nowhere were
way worse than this.

820
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,460
I was accepted the soprano's I was 
figuring like,

821
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,350
this is a long story.
It's over.

822
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,700
That makes sense.
I was just like,

823
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:48,410
I don't even know these characters.
All of a sudden,

824
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,310
boom,
it's over.

825
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,460
So I wrote on twitter.
I was like,

826
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,450
a serious man.
Seriously fucking sucked.

827
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,140
You know?
I was like,

828
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:55,500
well,
am I hate or am I doing that ticket?

829
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,270
I'm like,
no,

830
00:32:56,271 --> 00:32:59,110
but I'm a this.
I'm a fucking reviewer here now.

831
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,160
More viewer now you fucked me out of two
hours of my time.

832
00:33:01,161 --> 00:33:02,360
I feel like I deserve something back.

833
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,160
Yeah.
Plus you said it as Joe Rogan,

834
00:33:04,161 --> 00:33:05,740
not fucking mcfuck steak or whatever.

835
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,090
Yeah,
I think the message boards would be,

836
00:33:08,091 --> 00:33:10,970
I tried it on my board for awhile,
tried to make everybody put a picture of

837
00:33:10,971 --> 00:33:15,971
themselves and I said maybe we be nice 
to each other if we used our actual 

838
00:33:15,971 --> 00:33:19,740
photos of Atar,
but it only lasted for like a little 

839
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,361
bit.
Everybody wanted to be fucking darth 

840
00:33:22,361 --> 00:33:22,361
vader or something.

841
00:33:22,361 --> 00:33:24,030
Chicks dig somebody.
All the avatars on by border.

842
00:33:24,031 --> 00:33:29,031
I'll check suck a dick.
Somebody likes it or somebody just 

843
00:33:29,031 --> 00:33:31,931
recently tried to do that.
Whether you had to have your real name 

844
00:33:31,931 --> 00:33:33,220
on their message board,
but then all these pirate privacy things

845
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:33,770
going on.
Right?

846
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:34,650
Yeah.
Blizzard.

847
00:33:34,651 --> 00:33:35,380
Yeah.
The uh,

848
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:36,180
those games.

849
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:36,750
That's right.
Yeah.

850
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,620
Yeah.
Do you do gay?

851
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:38,700
You're a Gamer,
right?

852
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:41,640
You do like online gaming a lot or not 
like I used to.

853
00:33:41,641 --> 00:33:44,790
I mean I used to have pc stuff and then 
you,

854
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,490
I did console for a little bit but takes
up too much time.

855
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:51,540
Not like a once in a while I'll still do
like call of duty or something,

856
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:56,541
but you want to play for 11 hours in a 
row when you do that.

857
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,890
I get so addicted to it

858
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,410
online video games,
it's,

859
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,630
they're so addictive.
When like quake,

860
00:34:02,631 --> 00:34:04,970
like first person shooters,
I've talked about this many times.

861
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,910
I used to play 10 hours a day.
No bullshit.

862
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,330
Yeah,

863
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,690
that's how we actually kind of really 
first met.

864
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,120
That's how we met and bonded before the 
big,

865
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:15,700
uh,
the big breakup.

866
00:34:15,701 --> 00:34:20,701
But it was like a.
I remember you were telling me about 

867
00:34:20,701 --> 00:34:21,490
alienware computers and all that shit.
So I went out and got one.

868
00:34:21,491 --> 00:34:23,590
I basically got the computer,
he told me he had,

869
00:34:23,591 --> 00:34:25,390
which I didn't have the money for at the
time,

870
00:34:25,391 --> 00:34:26,440
but joe's like,
I got this,

871
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:31,000
it's a rig and area 51 fucking.
I went and got it.

872
00:34:31,001 --> 00:34:36,001
I was living in this shitty little 
studio on Hacienda and all I had was a 

873
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:41,220
Fuckin futon and my alienware computer.
I don't really know anybody out here 

874
00:34:41,441 --> 00:34:46,441
anyway when I first came out,
but I jumped on with Joe once while I'm 

875
00:34:46,441 --> 00:34:46,441
think like,
all right,

876
00:34:46,441 --> 00:34:48,070
quick three or whatever playing he would
like just Roy,

877
00:34:48,071 --> 00:34:49,750
right?
He just not even destroyed.

878
00:34:49,751 --> 00:34:50,830
It was not even fun.

879
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,430
Not even like,
it was just bad.

880
00:34:54,431 --> 00:34:55,780
It was like beyond rape.
Yeah.

881
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,030
He,
he'll do like kill me like 99 times in a

882
00:34:58,031 --> 00:35:03,031
row.
I don't even think I killed you once 

883
00:35:03,031 --> 00:35:03,031
maybe like three hour period.
And I'm like,

884
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:08,840
dude,
not only would joe be plasma rifling me 

885
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,030
up my ass like every other hit,
but then I'd hear through his whatever 

886
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:16,591
the headset,
like he'd be doing something else which 

887
00:35:16,591 --> 00:35:16,591
made it even fucking worse.
Like he,

888
00:35:16,591 --> 00:35:20,941
I could tell he was not even completely 
focused and sweating and doing that 

889
00:35:20,941 --> 00:35:25,711
thing where I'm like trying to sound 
like I'm not fucking raging on a good 

890
00:35:25,711 --> 00:35:25,711
shot.
Joe.

891
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,550
Turn off the Mike.
I'm like,

892
00:35:27,551 --> 00:35:28,600
fuck,
come on.

893
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,190
Quake is one of those,
those

894
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,520
games,
for those who don't know it,

895
00:35:31,521 --> 00:35:36,521
it's a first person shooter where you 
running down these three deed mazes and 

896
00:35:36,521 --> 00:35:40,261
you have all these different gun options
and it's one of those games that relies 

897
00:35:40,261 --> 00:35:43,821
very heavily on playing it all the time.
So the mouse and the keyboard literally 

898
00:35:43,821 --> 00:35:47,841
become like an extension of your mind 
and you can get it to do what you want 

899
00:35:47,841 --> 00:35:50,871
it to do because you're so comfortable 
with the movements you don't think 

900
00:35:50,871 --> 00:35:50,871
about,
you know,

901
00:35:50,871 --> 00:35:53,931
it's w a s,
d use the keys to move backward and 

902
00:35:53,931 --> 00:35:53,931
straight side to side.
But you don't think about it,

903
00:35:53,931 --> 00:35:58,430
just do it.
It's just like I'm going to the right 

904
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,471
when I go to the right,
I'm thinking to the right now as I'm 

905
00:36:00,471 --> 00:36:00,471
thinking my fingers and moving and you 
get totally sinked up with it.

906
00:36:00,471 --> 00:36:02,580
You have to do it like eight,
10 hours a day to day.

907
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,970
So I was obsessed.
I go online,

908
00:36:05,971 --> 00:36:10,971
that's what I would do it.
And I'd be like having conversations 

909
00:36:10,971 --> 00:36:13,101
with my check and I'd be thinking I 
could be playing quake right now 

910
00:36:13,101 --> 00:36:13,101
completely.
So I would have to pretend that I wanted

911
00:36:13,101 --> 00:36:15,450
to see a movie with her.
I was a complete junkie.

912
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,480
What was weird is that you are really 
competitive with the game where like I 

913
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,871
would just hide in the toilet paper roll
of the unreal bathroom map and just sit 

914
00:36:23,871 --> 00:36:25,400
there and snipe people where you're more
like kill every number.

915
00:36:25,401 --> 00:36:25,790
Second.
Yeah.

916
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:26,710
Well,
you know,

917
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,720
my leftover martial arts days,
there's still some work to be done in 

918
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,471
the back of my head,
so just fucking just running down 

919
00:36:35,471 --> 00:36:35,471
hallways,
shooting people.

920
00:36:35,471 --> 00:36:36,410
This thing is so satisfying.
It's so fun.

921
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:41,440
I remember it was over when I was at 
fry's electronics try to buy like shit 

922
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,620
that I've been thinking.
I'm like,

923
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:45,210
is there a mouse that has every button 
already on?

924
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:50,211
Like what can I do to fucking guys never
beat me.

925
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,730
By the way,
God's would do the same thing that I did

926
00:36:52,731 --> 00:36:54,200
to you.
To me it wasn't.

927
00:36:54,201 --> 00:36:56,150
It wasn't that many guys,
but every now and then you run into like

928
00:36:56,151 --> 00:37:01,151
a Chinese virgin,
some 13 year old kid who doesn't give a 

929
00:37:01,151 --> 00:37:03,641
fuck and he just every day,
15 hours a day just staring through his 

930
00:37:03,741 --> 00:37:07,340
bifocals at that fucking screen blast 
and do deserve rape me.

931
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:08,660
It would happen all the time and I'd be 
like,

932
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,430
Oh fuck.
I thought it was good.

933
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,130
Guys would go down and interview with 
rail guns.

934
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:14,740
Impossible shots.
You just,

935
00:37:14,741 --> 00:37:16,340
you showed up for a second.
Your Dad,

936
00:37:16,341 --> 00:37:17,390
you're like,
motherfucker,

937
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,240
some guys are just just on another level

938
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:24,110
and now kids have all the modded 
controllers and I'm just using a regular

939
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:24,740
controller.
So I'm like,

940
00:37:24,741 --> 00:37:26,510
I'm never going to have the advantage 
anymore.

941
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:27,480
They've got like these,
uh,

942
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:32,500
you know,
whatever wolf pack fucking sticks and 

943
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:32,500
it's like nine

944
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:32,500
deal with the console,
you know,

945
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,940
the console is just not as precise.
And they did a thing with a Microsoft 

946
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:41,111
started.
They did a competition between console 

947
00:37:41,111 --> 00:37:41,111
guys against a

948
00:37:41,111 --> 00:37:41,111
keyboard,
bass guys yet.

949
00:37:41,111 --> 00:37:43,090
But you would never play that.
You get used to the point.

950
00:37:43,091 --> 00:37:45,790
If everyone's doing the same controller,
then everyone's on the same page,

951
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:50,790
do you know?
But the same controller isn't as 

952
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:50,790
precise.
Why would you use that controller?

953
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:50,790
Yeah.

954
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:51,250
When you got another,
you can get really good at it.

955
00:37:51,251 --> 00:37:52,210
I mean,
you can't get as good,

956
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:57,240
right?
For what you like to play your kind of 

957
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,131
first instruction side.
You want to have the most connection 

958
00:38:01,121 --> 00:38:03,810
between you and what you know,
how fun it is to get on your ex boss.

959
00:38:03,811 --> 00:38:04,120
Go,
Oh,

960
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:05,800
Carla Smith.
See is playing call of duty.

961
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:06,970
Let's kill him a little bit.
Yeah,

962
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,850
it's so fun.
Do you ever kill him?

963
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,120
I played him once.
Really?

964
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,250
Yeah.
Is he any good?

965
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,410
No.
Really kick his ass.

966
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:19,460
I don't think.
I think I was more just like watching 

967
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:19,460
him.
Like I said,

968
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,620
I hang out in the toilet paper because 
I'm a video game foyer.

969
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,130
I went to his website the other day for 
something because I.

970
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:29,540
every now and then I'd like to read his 
twitter and go,

971
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:31,190
what the fuck?
Just so strange.

972
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:36,470
So I went to his website and it said one
of the most feared in the country.

973
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,360
That's like on his bio,
on the front of his book.

974
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,680
He's the punisher.
One of the most feared.

975
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,840
Like what?
A crazy thought.

976
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,810
You talk about the wrong psychology for 
comedy,

977
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,290
one of the most feared you want to be a 
feared comedian.

978
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,570
What is that?
What does that even really mean?

979
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,750
That's so strange.
Do you collect comics?

980
00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:01,020
What the fuck are you talking about?
We're talking about Carlton will be 

981
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:01,020
changing gears like that.
That's ridiculous.

982
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,130
We're talking about someone completely 
crazy.

983
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,590
Yeah.
I don't really know what that means.

984
00:39:05,591 --> 00:39:08,050
Who wants to be a feared comic?
It's horrible.

985
00:39:08,051 --> 00:39:09,250
It's a horrible way of thinking.

986
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,400
You want people to fear you.
Who's going to fear you?

987
00:39:12,401 --> 00:39:13,980
The audience.
Comedians.

988
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,370
Well,
what he likes to do,

989
00:39:15,371 --> 00:39:20,371
and you know,
he talked about it on the mark baron 

990
00:39:20,371 --> 00:39:20,371
podcast.
I thought it was really fascinating that

991
00:39:20,371 --> 00:39:21,070
he used to it,
but when he called back,

992
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,260
what's that?
Because he went,

993
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,950
he went in.
It was kind of,

994
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:25,480
you know,
what's weird?

995
00:39:25,481 --> 00:39:27,250
Marin was like,
it was very strange.

996
00:39:27,251 --> 00:39:28,790
It's very strange conversation,
but I don't,

997
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:31,330
I didn't understand why Marin didn't 
understand that he's completely insane.

998
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:34,240
Causes like gone.
He's like bipolar or something,

999
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:36,150
like there's something wrong.
But when,

1000
00:39:36,151 --> 00:39:37,480
when,
when you started talking about,

1001
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,130
um,
about uh,

1002
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,030
the,
um,

1003
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,980
uh,
during the podcast,

1004
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,890
what was it exactly?
Oh Shit,

1005
00:39:44,891 --> 00:39:45,730
now I'm trying to remember.

1006
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:53,010
Fuck God dammit.
I can't remember what the crazy part 

1007
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:54,540
was.
Oh,

1008
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:59,570
one of the crazy ones was did you tell 
me this one that he was saying that 

1009
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:02,221
some,
some troops that someone was thinking 

1010
00:40:02,221 --> 00:40:04,441
about killing themselves,
but they read his shit and are they saw 

1011
00:40:04,441 --> 00:40:04,441
him perform and they didn't kill 
themselves.

1012
00:40:04,441 --> 00:40:04,940
Then,
you know,

1013
00:40:04,941 --> 00:40:06,190
it wasn't me.
Well,

1014
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:11,240
I'm making shit up now and I'm just 
giving them room and he was talking 

1015
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,020
about how he would go onstage in front 
of guys on purpose to make them feel bad

1016
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,010
that he would.
Yeah,

1017
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:20,011
he was.
And he talked about how he did it to 

1018
00:40:20,011 --> 00:40:21,000
mark Marin.
He talked about how he did it to a.

1019
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:23,620
what's that dude's name?
I'm Steve Trevino.

1020
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,020
First Time Steve Trevino ever got the 
headline,

1021
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:28,360
Carlos went on right before them and did
like an hour,

1022
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,700
an hour,
45 minutes or something crazy.

1023
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,360
But when he was talking about he,
he comes like he's paint that.

1024
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:39,360
He did it.
That's the thing that's associated with 

1025
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:39,670
this fake.
I had to manage what I had to do.

1026
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:41,790
It's like why?
I think he's like,

1027
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,440
he's like,
he's broken legit,

1028
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:46,330
sociopath.
Where it doesn't.

1029
00:40:46,331 --> 00:40:51,331
He doesn't feel emotions way everybody 
else does and I don't think he feels 

1030
00:40:51,331 --> 00:40:53,620
when he's hurt either.
He's got like this weird block going on.

1031
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:58,650
It's.
I think you're talking about my brother 

1032
00:40:58,650 --> 00:40:58,650
and I think we're talking about a lot of
people.

1033
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:03,080
There was a book written recently called
the enemy amongst us or something like 

1034
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,211
that.
Something along those lines and it was 

1035
00:41:06,211 --> 00:41:07,981
all about sociopath's,
about how many people amongst us really 

1036
00:41:07,981 --> 00:41:08,350
don't feel emotions.
They just pretend they do to fit in,

1037
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:11,260
but they don't fear the consequences of 
their actions.

1038
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:13,110
They don't worry about hurting other 
people's feelings.

1039
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:14,340
You know?
That's a.

1040
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,990
that's a fucking real problem.
There's a lot of people like that.

1041
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:22,620
Yeah.
I think I'm on the fucking complete 

1042
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:22,620
other side of that,
man.

1043
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:22,620
I.
I'm one of those people.

1044
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,610
I feel like I feel everything want to be
a comic.

1045
00:41:24,611 --> 00:41:25,810
You have to be fucked up,
right?

1046
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:26,490
I mean,
you will.

1047
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,140
We would all admit to that.
You have to be sensitive.

1048
00:41:29,141 --> 00:41:30,880
You have to be.
You have to be insecure.

1049
00:41:30,881 --> 00:41:35,881
You have to be.
There's got to be something inside of 

1050
00:41:35,881 --> 00:41:37,651
you that wants attention so badly that 
it's willing to go through those early 

1051
00:41:37,651 --> 00:41:39,020
days because you know,
if you're not fucked up,

1052
00:41:39,021 --> 00:41:44,021
you're going to find something better.
You got to find something that doesn't 

1053
00:41:44,021 --> 00:41:44,021
hurt so much,
you know,

1054
00:41:44,021 --> 00:41:47,591
but that need to be special.
It's got to be so strong that you're 

1055
00:41:47,591 --> 00:41:47,660
willing to get through the bombing.

1056
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:48,890
Right,
right.

1057
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:53,240
I just remember being so afraid in 
because I was like the complete,

1058
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,010
not only introverted,
but I always like,

1059
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,980
I had like anxiety and social anxiety.
I still really do.

1060
00:41:57,981 --> 00:42:00,530
Actually.
It's funny because I can do huge fucking

1061
00:42:00,531 --> 00:42:03,470
arenas if the meet and greets 10 people.
I'm like,

1062
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,450
alright,
what are we doing?

1063
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:09,020
But in high school was really bad and I 
remember feeling like that,

1064
00:42:09,021 --> 00:42:11,360
uh,
that first time I got a laugh that light

1065
00:42:11,361 --> 00:42:14,180
broke up a moment and it was like,
oh,

1066
00:42:14,181 --> 00:42:18,900
that's the fucking weapon right there.
I want people to fear my comedy wants.

1067
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:19,260
What is that?

1068
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:24,700
My first one I did out of anger,
I had this really shitty math teacher 

1069
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,710
who was always mean and she would just,
you know,

1070
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:30,840
just treat you like you're really dumb 
if he didn't understand things and she 

1071
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,250
was a black lady and she was uh,
doing this thing on stage or on the,

1072
00:42:32,251 --> 00:42:37,251
uh,
on stage she was doing this thing in 

1073
00:42:37,251 --> 00:42:37,251
front of a chalkboard,
but she was writing something down.

1074
00:42:37,251 --> 00:42:38,280
I wasn't paying attention and she goes,
Mr Rogan,

1075
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:41,820
would you like to come up here and do 
both of these questions for the class?

1076
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:47,180
And I said,
would you like me to do both of those 

1077
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:47,340
questions?
And everybody went fucking crazy.

1078
00:42:47,341 --> 00:42:49,890
Like tubes could not help,
but they just don't laugh in.

1079
00:42:49,891 --> 00:42:52,560
And people slamming books down and then 
she kicked me out.

1080
00:42:52,561 --> 00:42:57,561
I got sent home for the day.
But I remember thinking at that moment 

1081
00:42:57,561 --> 00:42:57,561
like,
damn,

1082
00:42:57,561 --> 00:42:57,561
I just got that bit.

1083
00:42:57,561 --> 00:42:57,870
Yeah,
yeah,

1084
00:42:57,871 --> 00:42:59,740
yeah.
That's when the soundtrack starts,

1085
00:42:59,741 --> 00:43:00,140
man.
No,

1086
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,690
I know.
I know.

1087
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:02,810
After that it was like,

1088
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,370
she's being mean to me,
you know,

1089
00:43:05,371 --> 00:43:10,371
it was like an,
I shut her down in front of everybody 

1090
00:43:10,371 --> 00:43:10,371
else.
Like Dan,

1091
00:43:10,371 --> 00:43:10,371
that was my first heckle,

1092
00:43:10,371 --> 00:43:15,010
I just remember skipping school one day 
and I was at Brigham's Brigham's sure.

1093
00:43:16,211 --> 00:43:18,170
And I was just sitting there in my,
uh,

1094
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,960
Mr Hall,
the guy who was like,

1095
00:43:19,961 --> 00:43:22,120
the house dean came up,
but I'll say,

1096
00:43:22,121 --> 00:43:25,330
just sat in front of me like I was 
busted and he goes,

1097
00:43:25,331 --> 00:43:30,331
um,
and I was starting to do like plays or 

1098
00:43:30,331 --> 00:43:30,331
like write stuff.
And he goes,

1099
00:43:30,331 --> 00:43:30,331
he goes,
listen man.

1100
00:43:30,331 --> 00:43:31,450
He goes,
I know school's not for you.

1101
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,310
He was the first person to like,
he goes,

1102
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:35,680
I know school's not for you.
I know that theater and you know,

1103
00:43:35,681 --> 00:43:37,300
making people laugh.
You're kind of caught up now.

1104
00:43:37,301 --> 00:43:38,830
He goes,
that's really what you should do.

1105
00:43:38,831 --> 00:43:43,831
I know you wanted to be a comedian.
That's what you should do first person 

1106
00:43:43,831 --> 00:43:43,831
to ever tell me you should do that.

1107
00:43:43,831 --> 00:43:45,340
So nice to have someone there to say 
something like that.

1108
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:47,110
Yeah.
I never had anybody telling me that.

1109
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:52,260
Everybody told me I sucked my,
my own mom told me she didn't think I 

1110
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,350
should go into comedy because I wasn't 
very funny.

1111
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:57,010
I think that's more of a mom protecting 
herself.

1112
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:58,870
Sure.
But for sure.

1113
00:43:58,871 --> 00:44:01,320
But God damn lady,
my girlfriend,

1114
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:07,950
my girlfriend does comedy because she,
she watches her friend do and it's like 

1115
00:44:07,961 --> 00:44:09,640
embarrassing.
She feels bad and she's like,

1116
00:44:09,641 --> 00:44:10,310
Oh,
you don't want it.

1117
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,480
She just doesn't want you to eat it and 
watching somebody eat is hard.

1118
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:15,610
My friend Eddie,
you know we've talked about that.

1119
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:18,070
I've got Eddie to do stand up nine 
times.

1120
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:20,440
He's a funny guy.
He says like really funny shit,

1121
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:21,640
like always.
And I'm like,

1122
00:44:21,641 --> 00:44:23,500
dude,
you could totally be a comic.

1123
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:28,740
I'm like,
within two years of fucking around and 

1124
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:28,740
practice and you'll be opening up for me
on the road.

1125
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,100
I'll help you.
I'll cut out a lot of the time,

1126
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:31,130
the development time,
like,

1127
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,190
dude,
you could be a comment.

1128
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,910
Just listen to me.
I can help you said,

1129
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,700
fuck yeah,
I'm going to do this.

1130
00:44:34,701 --> 00:44:36,920
So I is.
And he just fuck it.

1131
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,810
Over and over.
The bombings were so disastrous.

1132
00:44:44,811 --> 00:44:45,750
It was so hard to watch.

1133
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,650
It's funny how like people that we know 
that are funny and when they tried the,

1134
00:44:49,651 --> 00:44:54,651
it's almost like they land on stage,
the furthest place from what really 

1135
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:55,650
actually makes them funny.
You're fucking interesting.

1136
00:44:56,130 --> 00:45:01,130
Yeah.
Well they just don't know how to be 

1137
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:02,871
perceived.
They just get confused as to how they 

1138
00:45:02,871 --> 00:45:02,871
should be perceived.
It's just they want,

1139
00:45:02,871 --> 00:45:04,980
they want to like,
they want to like somehow knew that like

1140
00:45:04,981 --> 00:45:07,380
fit this mold of what they think is 
going to be funny.

1141
00:45:07,381 --> 00:45:12,381
It's like the connection between them 
and the audience is so distant and 

1142
00:45:12,381 --> 00:45:14,340
fucked up and Jag in there's barbed wire
in the way.

1143
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:19,430
Just it's for most people,
they don't understand that in order to 

1144
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:20,460
be able to be yourself and get onstage 
and talk in front of somebody,

1145
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,060
you have to like really know what the 
fuck you,

1146
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:29,180
how you're coming off.
You have to really know yourself in a 

1147
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:29,180
way that a lot of people aren't covered.

1148
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:29,510
I'm looking at themselves,
yeah,

1149
00:45:29,511 --> 00:45:30,800
you have to you after.
It's.

1150
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,880
It's about being revealing and then 
finally not giving a fuck anymore that 

1151
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,760
people don't like what they see and then
you can slowly find the people that like

1152
00:45:39,761 --> 00:45:41,380
what they see and build the last from 
there,

1153
00:45:41,381 --> 00:45:41,650
man,

1154
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:43,640
and it's got to be a real,
not give a fuck.

1155
00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:48,641
You can't be on pretending to not give a
fuck like you have to have mastered it 

1156
00:45:48,641 --> 00:45:51,821
to enough where you've understood the 
situation and you've assessed it and 

1157
00:45:51,821 --> 00:45:55,631
you'd been objective about the whole 
relationship between the EU and the 

1158
00:45:55,631 --> 00:45:58,901
audience over and over again.
So many times that you will completely 

1159
00:45:58,901 --> 00:46:01,871
mastered it and then you're comfortable 
with the experience and then only then 

1160
00:46:01,871 --> 00:46:02,660
can you go up there and just be yourself
and fuck around and be funny.

1161
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:04,340
Right?
But until you hit that vibe,

1162
00:46:04,341 --> 00:46:06,050
that one groove,
you know,

1163
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,730
you,
you're just go out there going,

1164
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:08,870
clunk,
clunk,

1165
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:12,560
clunk,
please love me.

1166
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:18,340
Please.
What can I do to make a connection with 

1167
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:18,340
you?
And you get it like little bits or touch

1168
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,780
you at all,
but it doesn't grab you and hug you.

1169
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:22,040
You know,
in the beginning days like every now and

1170
00:46:22,041 --> 00:46:24,230
then you'll,
you your crack like one bit.

1171
00:46:24,231 --> 00:46:24,950
That was like,
oh,

1172
00:46:24,951 --> 00:46:27,560
it has a something there and people 
would laugh.

1173
00:46:27,561 --> 00:46:30,050
Ha Ha.
Like I think there's something there.

1174
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,580
I think I,
I'm touching.

1175
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,440
There's gold under here and we'd keep 
digging.

1176
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:35,180
Fuck,
it's hard.

1177
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:39,170
Listen to yourself a lot like you record
your sets and I really,

1178
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,820
I never used to until I,
you know,

1179
00:46:40,821 --> 00:46:44,210
you make cds and then you have to,
which is brutal.

1180
00:46:44,211 --> 00:46:46,400
And also,
I mean I remember listening to the first

1181
00:46:46,401 --> 00:46:47,430
cd and I went,
okay,

1182
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:51,980
at that point in my life there was no 
real drama in my life.

1183
00:46:51,981 --> 00:46:54,500
There was nothing,
nothing dramatic about my life.

1184
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:59,710
It was pretty easy going.
A lot of my first stuff was very 

1185
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:01,460
nostalgic and very kind of like,
this is the stuff I grew up with.

1186
00:47:01,461 --> 00:47:02,420
We,
it's fun.

1187
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:06,200
That's what I knew and as I listened to 
that I was like,

1188
00:47:06,201 --> 00:47:06,830
all right,
two things.

1189
00:47:06,831 --> 00:47:08,600
First of all,
when I listened to myself,

1190
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:13,070
like I would say 40 percent of it,
there's no words.

1191
00:47:13,071 --> 00:47:16,520
It was just physicality and that was 
what I started really getting passionate

1192
00:47:16,521 --> 00:47:18,620
about vernacular and wanting to build up
a,

1193
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:21,560
you know,
language and paint better stories with,

1194
00:47:21,561 --> 00:47:23,540
with words,
and not only that,

1195
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:28,541
but I,
I started having things happened in my 

1196
00:47:28,541 --> 00:47:31,661
life and my personal life with,
especially with my folks that really 

1197
00:47:31,661 --> 00:47:31,661
were

1198
00:47:31,661 --> 00:47:31,661
like,
alright,

1199
00:47:31,661 --> 00:47:35,370
you know what?
I'm not a kid anymore who just goes up 

1200
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:35,370
and talks about fucking or,
or you know,

1201
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:35,480
Frat,
you know,

1202
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:36,670
kind of humor,
drinking.

1203
00:47:36,671 --> 00:47:37,960
It was like,
I have real issues,

1204
00:47:37,961 --> 00:47:42,961
real problems,
but now how do I turn a corner and how 

1205
00:47:42,961 --> 00:47:42,961
can I,
you know,

1206
00:47:42,961 --> 00:47:46,310
it,
it takes a while to be able to not 

1207
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:48,480
reinvent but like how to have a 
metamorphosis onstage with truth and 

1208
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,000
light where you're at in your life.

1209
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:51,570
I feel that all the criticism that 
you've gotten,

1210
00:47:51,571 --> 00:47:54,240
and I can see this for myself,
all the criticism that I've gotten,

1211
00:47:54,241 --> 00:47:58,530
even the stuff that hurts and even the 
stuff that was wrong and just hurtful,

1212
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:04,190
it helps me absolutely improved me.
Even the Douche bags of improved me 

1213
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:06,810
because it's made me look at myself 
through their eyes and go,

1214
00:48:06,811 --> 00:48:08,040
okay,
do they have a point?

1215
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:13,220
Like what?
What is it about me that's offensive to 

1216
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,471
them?
What is it about me that they don't 

1217
00:48:15,471 --> 00:48:15,471
like,
you know,

1218
00:48:15,471 --> 00:48:15,471
and,
and then you see it and you go,

1219
00:48:15,471 --> 00:48:15,471
oh,
okay,

1220
00:48:15,471 --> 00:48:19,791
I can see how maybe I'm being kind of 
Douchey or like I've had bits from my 

1221
00:48:19,791 --> 00:48:24,351
old CD's,
I w I would like to go back and change 

1222
00:48:24,351 --> 00:48:24,351
it.
I was like,

1223
00:48:24,351 --> 00:48:25,530
I don't even want that being represented
of a representative of my thinking.

1224
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:30,540
I like that.
Any specials that air and people just 

1225
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:30,540
discover you and they're like,
oh,

1226
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,270
is that what you do?
I go to England a lot and I love it over

1227
00:48:33,271 --> 00:48:35,100
there,
but I had an old bit about just shitting

1228
00:48:35,101 --> 00:48:40,101
on England of fucking stupid.
It was like other women are disgusting 

1229
00:48:40,101 --> 00:48:40,620
and it was just a mean bit for no 
reason.

1230
00:48:40,621 --> 00:48:43,650
I just met a couple of English people.
I didn't like his this crazy bit,

1231
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:46,620
but now it's like I want to say like,
I don't really think that way anymore.

1232
00:48:46,621 --> 00:48:47,820
This is just douchey shit.

1233
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:49,020
Yeah.
I definitely looked back.

1234
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,750
No regrets because everything builds you
up to where you're at,

1235
00:48:51,751 --> 00:48:53,730
but for me when it was like,
okay,

1236
00:48:53,731 --> 00:48:58,670
I finally hit a crossed over and I.
I remember I knew I had a moment where I

1237
00:48:58,671 --> 00:48:59,370
was like,
okay,

1238
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,430
what all the Djs in the country,
we're really talking about me.

1239
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,170
That's what I knew.
I was in trouble.

1240
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,450
That's what I really battened down the 
hatches and I was like,

1241
00:49:06,451 --> 00:49:11,451
all right,
I know what two years from now I know 

1242
00:49:11,451 --> 00:49:13,581
the way this is going to go and I know 
the way it's gonna come back and you 

1243
00:49:13,581 --> 00:49:13,581
know what?
I just took it.

1244
00:49:13,581 --> 00:49:17,480
I took it on the chin.
I pretty much fucking just kept showing 

1245
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,751
up doing my thing because when,
when the pendulum swings into the good 

1246
00:49:20,751 --> 00:49:24,591
area,
it's going the same fucking direction 

1247
00:49:24,591 --> 00:49:24,591
and the other area,
man,

1248
00:49:24,591 --> 00:49:24,591
it's really,

1249
00:49:24,591 --> 00:49:28,100
there's a real backlash for somebody who
works hard to get attention.

1250
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:32,270
That's a weird thing about people when 
you work hard to get attention,

1251
00:49:32,271 --> 00:49:37,271
if you get attention and people like 
people love Dave Chappelle and one of 

1252
00:49:37,271 --> 00:49:37,271
the things I love about Dave Chappelle,
he's,

1253
00:49:37,271 --> 00:49:38,590
he's very reclusive.
He,

1254
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:43,630
he goes onstage like weird.
It'll show up in a park with a fucking 

1255
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:44,330
PA system and do a show.
It's weird,

1256
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:46,940
but when people promote a lot and 
people,

1257
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:47,270
uh,
you know,

1258
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:50,900
get their name out there a lot,
there's a backlash for that always.

1259
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:51,680
Why is that?

1260
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:52,300
I don't know,
man.

1261
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:53,520
What the fuck is that?
I got that.

1262
00:49:53,521 --> 00:49:58,521
Well,
I mean I did that because in 1998 I was 

1263
00:49:58,521 --> 00:50:00,630
sitting around doing nothing for most of
the day except waiting for sets.

1264
00:50:00,631 --> 00:50:05,631
I just come out here and I was watching 
a documentary on fucking punk bands and 

1265
00:50:05,631 --> 00:50:06,870
they were showing them put up like,
Hey,

1266
00:50:06,871 --> 00:50:09,150
we're dragon face.
And like literally,

1267
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:12,660
you know,
nailing their flyers to telephone poles.

1268
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:15,980
And I remember sitting there going like,
this is what I need to do.

1269
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:20,280
Whatever the modern version of that is.
I need to fucking build a fan base.

1270
00:50:20,281 --> 00:50:23,260
I need to like some kind of grassroots 
thing because I'm going,

1271
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,340
I don't want this to pass me by and,
and then what do I have?

1272
00:50:26,341 --> 00:50:28,190
Nothing.
I'm at nothing

1273
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:33,190
else.
I'm really shitty at a lot of things in 

1274
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:33,350
this world.
Really bad.

1275
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,450
I think that's the only way you ever 
make it as a comic.

1276
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:39,110
If I had other career paths,
my other career path was brain damage.

1277
00:50:39,111 --> 00:50:40,730
My other career path was kickboxing.
I'm like,

1278
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:45,760
what am I going to do?
I'm going to get brain damage for no 

1279
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:45,760
money or I'm going to become a comic.
Well,

1280
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,700
I don't have any other skills.
I don't have a college degree.

1281
00:50:46,701 --> 00:50:48,590
What the fuck am I going to do?
I can't work.

1282
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:53,620
I'm a shitty worker.
I would show up at construction 

1283
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:53,870
gateshead last two weeks,
pocket the money and then quit and like,

1284
00:50:53,871 --> 00:50:57,740
fuck this tar roofs and it was like half
a day and I'm out.

1285
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:58,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

1286
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:02,030
Boston man.
Those people fucking work hard and you,

1287
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:07,040
you know that there's an east coast 
coast work ethic because of the fact 

1288
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,660
that it snows there and it gets deathly 
cold in the winter.

1289
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,160
People are hard,
right?

1290
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:11,480
They fucking work,
man.

1291
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:16,510
They get up at seven in the morning and 
they're at work by eight and they 

1292
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:19,700
fucking work all day in the snow and the
Sun Ninety fucking degrees out,

1293
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:22,010
hammering nails that.
That's a hard gig bro.

1294
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:24,230
You construction in Boston and it's 
like,

1295
00:51:24,231 --> 00:51:25,040
you know,
you're doing that,

1296
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:27,140
but when you know those people were 
cutting into your shows,

1297
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:29,960
probably why the guys before it's,
it's like you better give them a fucking

1298
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,130
show.
Fuck yeah,

1299
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:36,180
you better work really hard job when you
come home tired and you just been a guy 

1300
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,270
who kind of went from college to comedy 
and kind of drifted through.

1301
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:41,780
You don't appreciate people's attention 
spans people,

1302
00:51:41,781 --> 00:51:43,310
especially on Friday night,
10:00,

1303
00:51:43,311 --> 00:51:46,490
shout there fucking tired.
They are tired,

1304
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:51,740
you know,
those people worked all day and they'd 

1305
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:51,740
been drinking.
Yeah.

1306
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,020
Comedy is such a fucking strange thing,
man.

1307
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:59,410
It's so strange.
It's like it is our connection with 

1308
00:51:59,410 --> 00:51:59,410
something.

1309
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:02,530
That's what it is.
It's like everybody's got their own 

1310
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:02,530
connection to it and you know,
and everybody's trying to figure out how

1311
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:03,560
this guy connected and how is he 
connected.

1312
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:08,590
Yeah.
But you're the best guy at connecting 

1313
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:08,590
with the Internet.
You,

1314
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:10,520
you are the very reason why I started 
myspace page.

1315
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,000
I read an article about you in people 
magazine.

1316
00:52:13,001 --> 00:52:18,001
I was at my dermatologist checking to 
see if I had a fucking staph infection 

1317
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:18,820
because I do Jujitsu.
You get Zits,

1318
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:20,600
you gotta get them checked out because 
it might be staff.

1319
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:25,710
So I'm sitting there and I'm reading 
this article in people magazine and it 

1320
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:26,000
said you had $300,000
space fans.

1321
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:30,530
And I was like,
you fucking imagine I go 300,000

1322
00:52:30,531 --> 00:52:35,531
people.
You could just send out an email with 

1323
00:52:35,531 --> 00:52:35,531
300,000
people.

1324
00:52:35,531 --> 00:52:35,531
My,
that's incredible.

1325
00:52:35,531 --> 00:52:35,531
I'm like,
that's fucking brilliant.

1326
00:52:35,531 --> 00:52:40,121
So I started myspace page that day and I
hired my friend Duncan to take care of 

1327
00:52:40,121 --> 00:52:42,590
it.
My friend Duncan got a job and my friend

1328
00:52:42,591 --> 00:52:46,310
Dunkin's jobs just add friends to my 
space age and you know,

1329
00:52:46,311 --> 00:52:51,311
and uh,
I'd send them blogs and he put up my 

1330
00:52:51,311 --> 00:52:51,311
blogs and shit.
Like

1331
00:52:51,311 --> 00:52:51,890
I love it.
How attached do you seem like you always

1332
00:52:51,891 --> 00:52:53,600
are?
It seems like you answer every.

1333
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:58,640
Almost everyone's like,
I've talked to so many people that 

1334
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,180
you've answered like twits or my spaces 
or facebook.

1335
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:03,230
Are you really on the Internet that much
or you that or do you have like a staff?

1336
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:08,710
Oh Man,
I never had anybody else logged into my 

1337
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:08,710
stuff ever.
It was always,

1338
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:08,710
always may.
Still,

1339
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:13,490
always.
How much time a day do you spend 

1340
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:13,490
responding to emails?
Do you still use my space?

1341
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,780
I know cook gave up on you,
bitch.

1342
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:22,940
When Dane Cook gives up on my space,
that's like Tila Tequila.

1343
00:53:22,941 --> 00:53:25,010
That is still on.
She's still swinging a fucked.

1344
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:25,980
They

1345
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,670
don't take care of their home.
They don't.

1346
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,990
They don't and they haven't touched it 
since and it's.

1347
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:32,240
There's so many stupid things like 
adding friend request.

1348
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,090
You know that hard.
There's two.

1349
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:36,140
They're not sexy anymore.
You know something.

1350
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,500
Something else sexier came along that 
got it right.

1351
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:42,790
By simplicity,
not letting you put fucking glitter tags

1352
00:53:42,791 --> 00:53:45,450
and every time I go to your page,
music starts playing and yeah,

1353
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:50,770
weird hearts fall,
but you always had the best pages man.

1354
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:56,870
Like on my space.
And just personally do you do at your 

1355
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:57,800
design yourself?
I learned html code,

1356
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:02,900
I about like html for dummies because I 
literally had nothing to do all day and 

1357
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:07,010
if I wasn't playing video games right,
I was fucking bored man.

1358
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:09,590
I was bored and I wanted to.
I treat honestly.

1359
00:54:09,591 --> 00:54:10,120
It was like,
alright,

1360
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:12,350
this is politics.
I need to shake hands.

1361
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:15,400
I need a kiss fucking babies because I 
want,

1362
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,820
I want money and I don't want to live in
this fucking shitty apartment with A.

1363
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:23,840
I think like Don Harris lived downstairs
would just be fucking screaming at 

1364
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:26,160
people don't know.

1365
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:31,390
He hosts a thing called the Ding Dong 
show at the comedy store and it's all 

1366
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:32,530
the most psychotic open milkers.
There's,

1367
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:37,560
there's certain open microbes that are 
like completely delusional and 

1368
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,661
absolutely insane and their acts are 
just so bizarre that you can't believe 

1369
00:54:40,661 --> 00:54:44,531
that real well.
Don Baer is puts on a show specifically 

1370
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:44,531
with those people.
It's fucking genius,

1371
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:45,590
but he's always surrounded by nothing.

1372
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:47,720
And you were Polanski and windy city 
heat.

1373
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:51,310
That was one of my favorite movie,
favorite things I've done.

1374
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,360
I just rewatched.
It was like,

1375
00:54:52,361 --> 00:54:53,830
holy shit,
that's Dane Cook like the first time.

1376
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,530
Never realized it was us,

1377
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:58,450
still have not seen that.
I still have not seen it.

1378
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,540
It's great for people who don't know 
that they.

1379
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:03,680
They punked this guy for a whole movie.
Right.

1380
00:55:03,681 --> 00:55:06,110
And Kim oil pretty much swept in,
made a whole movie,

1381
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,020
pretended this guy was famous and they 
had.

1382
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,230
The guy's crazy.
I mean,

1383
00:55:09,231 --> 00:55:10,590
they're basically taking advantage of 
Harrison.

1384
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:16,220
He was always at the comedy store.
The guy who was always there and they 

1385
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:16,490
had this guy convinced that he was 
famous and it worked.

1386
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:18,500
But basically it's kind of sad.
I mean they're picking on him.

1387
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:23,660
It is sad until you finally hear the 
stuff that wasn't in the movie and just 

1388
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:23,910
how fucking evil he is.
Oh,

1389
00:55:23,911 --> 00:55:24,990
he's crazy.
He's crazy.

1390
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,070
You know,
I,

1391
00:55:26,071 --> 00:55:29,060
I feel like he's just a broken person.
Yeah,

1392
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:30,000
he's.
Well,

1393
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:31,260
he's weird.
He's a Weirdo

1394
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:37,420
that's broken.
It's weird that like being a facebook 

1395
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:40,171
friend with him too,
because he is still talking about that 

1396
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:41,100
movie today.
I want to leave his car.

1397
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:42,350
Read is crazy shit.
Oh yeah.

1398
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:47,460
I fucked up.
Read a fucked up and Ted Haggard banned 

1399
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:48,400
me.
I was loving reading his crazy shit.

1400
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:53,550
Yeah.
Who's your favorite twitters and people 

1401
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:53,550
to follow on twitter and do you have any
like guilty,

1402
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:56,260
like Ted nugent's or anything like that 
or wish Ted nugent was on twitter.

1403
00:55:56,261 --> 00:55:58,050
I tried to find him.
He wasn't in there.

1404
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,090
Dammit.
Fuck.

1405
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,710
I've got all kinds of crazy dudes 
online.

1406
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:08,010
I love it.
It's like a party that I put together 

1407
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:08,010
with all these nutty people that never 
be together.

1408
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:09,750
There's a thing called flip book now 
too.

1409
00:56:09,751 --> 00:56:11,520
You've got to get this app bad on your 
ipad.

1410
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:12,340
What is it?
It's.

1411
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:17,350
It's.
It's a fucking APP that makes you plug 

1412
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:21,441
into your facebook or twitter and it 
turns whatever your feet is into a 

1413
00:56:21,441 --> 00:56:21,441
magazine.
Yeah.

1414
00:56:21,441 --> 00:56:24,940
You with the pictures in the magazine,
so whatever the links are,

1415
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:30,060
it makes it like an article like 
Hollywood reporter or People magazine 

1416
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:31,840
and you flip through and then it's just 
like it'll be your fucking face with one

1417
00:56:31,841 --> 00:56:36,841
of your quotes.
You've got to see this med school and 

1418
00:56:36,841 --> 00:56:37,210
already report type.
It's cool dude.

1419
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:39,690
So good as policy.
I got Paul's.

1420
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:40,880
Yeah,
that's good.

1421
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:41,750
Yeah.
Yeah.

1422
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,140
If you want it basic.
I love the IPAD,

1423
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:49,530
I've got stuff.
I've been working on an app too because 

1424
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:49,530
now that's the new thing,
man.

1425
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:50,410
It's like,
you know now everybody wants.

1426
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:55,570
You got to be in somebody's pocket.
People don't want to fucking log into a 

1427
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:55,570
site anymore.
It's like,

1428
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:55,570
dude,
I don't wanna.

1429
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:57,470
I don't want to mess with all that.
Be In my fucking pocket.

1430
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:57,880
An APP

1431
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:01,330
working on right now for this podcast,
for a Libsyn,

1432
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,060
Libsyn,
the company that's hosting us,

1433
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:05,320
they make apps for you,
so it's really cool.

1434
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:07,270
When they host your podcast.
I'll make you an iphone APP.

1435
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:12,340
Yeah,
you have a couple iphone apps are used 

1436
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:12,340
to have.
I took them all off.

1437
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:12,350
I did have one with this animal and 
those guys,

1438
00:57:12,351 --> 00:57:14,030
which is great.
They did an amazing job,

1439
00:57:14,031 --> 00:57:19,031
but I got a company working on a new app
now with just the whole push 

1440
00:57:19,031 --> 00:57:22,961
notification thing because I mean I 
think one of the best companies out 

1441
00:57:22,961 --> 00:57:22,961
there for like when people are talking 
about promoting,

1442
00:57:22,961 --> 00:57:24,950
how can I promote?
I'm a musician,

1443
00:57:24,951 --> 00:57:25,940
I'm a comedian,
whatever.

1444
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:31,390
It's like these things like say now St.
that's a little you call up and leave a 

1445
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:33,380
little voice message,
but it hits everybody.

1446
00:57:33,381 --> 00:57:36,140
Everybody who joins your say now if you 
send a text,

1447
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:41,500
it's 100 percent fucking guarantee.
Everybody's going to get it and you can 

1448
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:41,570
go regional.
If you're going into New York,

1449
00:57:41,571 --> 00:57:44,360
do shows you can hit New York with the 
St [inaudible] voice message.

1450
00:57:44,361 --> 00:57:49,361
Hey,
tickets today if you guys want to come 

1451
00:57:49,361 --> 00:57:51,221
see me,
it's last minute as opposed to my space 

1452
00:57:51,221 --> 00:57:51,221
or whatever.
You're hitting like point.

1453
00:57:51,221 --> 00:57:55,870
Oh,
four percent of people who twitter like 

1454
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:55,870
if they don't see that stream,
right?

1455
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:57,980
Twenty minutes later,
if you repeat it like an enterprise,

1456
00:57:57,990 --> 00:58:02,240
like you're spamming promotionally when 
we want to get the word out.

1457
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:04,030
So it's like mailing say now

1458
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:09,680
people that I actually go to their 
twitter page and like read their 

1459
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,330
personal tweets just to see.
But you have to do that.

1460
00:58:11,331 --> 00:58:12,470
You have to go back and like,
oh,

1461
00:58:12,471 --> 00:58:15,040
this is funny or this is a cool link.
Like you have to go.

1462
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:17,660
There's no way you're gonna catch it and
if you have like tweet deck or something

1463
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:18,850
like that and there's no way you're 
gonna catch it.

1464
00:58:18,851 --> 00:58:20,370
Just so you've got to.
How many people do you follow?

1465
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:22,160
You follow?
A lot of people are like 70.

1466
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:23,970
That's it.
Damn my fault.

1467
00:58:23,971 --> 00:58:25,400
Hundreds.
I think I fall like 500.

1468
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:27,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

1469
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:29,880
And I was missing so much that like,
but now you can do lists.

1470
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:30,480
I have was

1471
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:33,990
on there either.
So many cool people to follow.

1472
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:37,170
Right?
I love like seeing like religious people

1473
00:58:37,171 --> 00:58:38,280
right next to porn stars.

1474
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:41,400
It's all right.
There you go.

1475
00:58:41,401 --> 00:58:46,401
Like this.
Like you're doing something to them by 

1476
00:58:46,401 --> 00:58:46,401
forcing them to cooperate together.
If this is a party,

1477
00:58:46,401 --> 00:58:47,700
this would never fucking work.

1478
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:52,980
Bring politicians and porn stars and you
know,

1479
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I,
I try to just make it as weird as 

1480
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:58,000
possible.
Any fucked up person.

1481
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Haters are fun.
A lot of haters and I add them to all 

1482
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:02,000
kinds of weird fucking people.
Man.

1483
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,550
I will say this.
I have every email that everybody's ever

1484
00:59:05,551 --> 00:59:06,660
written.
Me a serious.

1485
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:11,690
Yeah.
I figured out like this method with Mac 

1486
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:12,390
mail years ago of like,
and I have everything in folders,

1487
00:59:12,391 --> 00:59:13,500
man.
It's Kinda crazy,

1488
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:18,800
but I've every military email I have 
every fucking like I have one called 

1489
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,530
Weirdos and it's just bad shit.
Crazy.

1490
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:22,220
They publish

1491
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,630
a book on that.
I should man,

1492
00:59:23,631 --> 00:59:25,390
because I've had a couple of interesting
stockers.

1493
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,590
Dude.
I've had a couple of fucking really?

1494
00:59:27,591 --> 00:59:28,280
Really?
Yeah.

1495
00:59:28,281 --> 00:59:30,260
You want me to throw them out for a 
little shout out?

1496
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:37,490
Like a story that we were talking about 
before the started doing this.

1497
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:39,180
That's one of the reasons why I won't 
talk about it on the air.

1498
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:43,110
Them to know that.
Interesting though I,

1499
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,900
I'm sitting there right now going into 
me.

1500
00:59:44,901 --> 00:59:49,901
He sent me my,
my favorite was the wireless ceo mail 

1501
00:59:49,901 --> 00:59:49,901
that we got after that video.
How much?

1502
00:59:49,901 --> 00:59:51,000
Like crazy.
Oh,

1503
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:52,670
angry,
angry Mexicans.

1504
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:56,300
Terrible writing.
I mean I saved a bunch of them.

1505
00:59:56,301 --> 01:00:00,050
I had a whole folder called Carlos fans.
It was just the most ridiculous messages

1506
01:00:00,051 --> 01:00:01,700
that I got.
It was shocking.

1507
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,250
Just shocking how dumb some people are 
out there.

1508
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:07,560
What's weird about the whole text 
messaging and everything?

1509
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:12,560
Like somebody I know,
I'm not to say it is calls me all the 

1510
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:16,151
time,
never texted me and I won't even answer 

1511
01:00:16,151 --> 01:00:16,151
the phone anymore because it's just like
stupid questions.

1512
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:19,660
I think the phone calls to dying,
I think to the point where I do too.

1513
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:20,180
You know,
I,

1514
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:22,950
I'd rather be making calls in my car.
Yeah.

1515
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:26,780
When I'm hooking up to the Bluetooth,
I can have cool conversations.

1516
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:31,810
You know,
when I'm driving for an hour or so 

1517
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:31,810
later.
You can text though,

1518
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:31,810
like,
no.

1519
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:33,760
Why would I want to do that when I can 
have a conversation in the car?

1520
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:34,910
That's silly.
You,

1521
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:36,950
you would rather text and have a 
conversation,

1522
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:38,090
Huh?
Yes.

1523
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:38,930
Really?
Yes.

1524
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:46,870
My problem is I have like a really weird
creative head where I thought I start 

1525
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:49,180
thinking about something and somebody 
calls me during that I,

1526
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:54,190
I lose it.
So like I'm just connecting my phone 

1527
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:54,190
man.
Yeah,

1528
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:54,190
I know.
But then I don't know.

1529
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:55,730
I'd rather be in this motor.
Go,

1530
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,580
y'all do it.
Then you're not committed.

1531
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:00,790
I told you that right room.
That program that I use,

1532
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,570
this is what I do.
I disconnect the phone,

1533
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:04,430
I shut off my cell phone,
I tell everybody,

1534
01:01:04,431 --> 01:01:07,340
leave me the fuck alone.
I'm going to write and then that's it.

1535
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:09,770
I go back there and write with right 
room.

1536
01:01:09,771 --> 01:01:14,771
All you see.
Have you ever used that for writing 

1537
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:14,771
shit?
Check this up.

1538
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:14,830
And like my mom says,
listen,

1539
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,880
your mom talked to my mom for 15 
minutes.

1540
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:18,880
I want to shoot myself.
Check this up.

1541
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,550
When you use it,
it um,

1542
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:27,830
it makes it turned into the whole.
This is all you see on your desk,

1543
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:31,310
you see is green tax and black screen.
You can't,

1544
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:35,180
you can't access your task bar,
but smart you can do anything.

1545
01:01:35,181 --> 01:01:37,400
The only thing you can do is you could 
quit and you know,

1546
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:39,680
that's hard man.
And that keeps you focused.

1547
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:41,620
Totally focused.
And I shut my phone off,

1548
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:43,940
I write and I ended up seeing shit pop 
up.

1549
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:45,470
Yeah.
Yeah.

1550
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:50,480
Or you know,
you just think maybe I should just beat 

1551
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,421
off.
And then you just go start checking out 

1552
01:01:52,421 --> 01:01:52,421
porn sites and spanking went off.
Yeah,

1553
01:01:52,421 --> 01:01:54,650
I hear you're writing a book right now.
I'm trying.

1554
01:01:56,290 --> 01:01:57,200
That shit's hard,
man.

1555
01:01:57,201 --> 01:02:00,260
That's probably the hardest things I've 
ever fucking taken on.

1556
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:02,540
I'm writing one right now and I won't 
let anybody help me.

1557
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:05,390
People came were like,
you're going to hire this guy and no one

1558
01:02:05,391 --> 01:02:08,240
will ever know and Zach and so and so 
used to them and I'm like,

1559
01:02:08,241 --> 01:02:09,740
first of all,
that's pathetic.

1560
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:12,470
And secondly,
fuck this.

1561
01:02:12,471 --> 01:02:14,930
I want this to be the hardest thing that
I ever accomplished.

1562
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:20,010
Yeah.
I want to make sure that everyone knows 

1563
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:20,130
that every word is in a certain order

1564
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:22,080
because I wrote it.
That's what it is.

1565
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:23,250
It's all of it,
right?

1566
01:02:23,251 --> 01:02:25,950
It's the best representation that I can 
come up with my thoughts.

1567
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:28,740
But you're a great writer.
I mean I've read some of your stuff.

1568
01:02:28,741 --> 01:02:31,080
It's like you don't need any help in 
that department.

1569
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:32,970
Well thank you.
But I think everybody does.

1570
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:34,910
You know,
I think you use a,

1571
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:37,890
in the beginning especially,
you could use someone else's.

1572
01:02:37,891 --> 01:02:38,660
I,
you know,

1573
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:42,090
someone else who sees what you're doing 
and has a different opinion on things.

1574
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:45,600
I think that's very beneficial.
I've given my stuff,

1575
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:50,630
you know,
to friends or people that I trust to 

1576
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:50,630
read it after the fact,
but so in that sense they help.

1577
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:51,570
I mean,
you get feedback.

1578
01:02:51,571 --> 01:02:56,571
I think I'm definitely a better writer 
now because of all the feedback that 

1579
01:02:56,571 --> 01:02:56,571
I've gotten from people through the 
years,

1580
01:02:56,571 --> 01:02:56,920
you know,
it's like the same.

1581
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:59,760
It's like comedy in a way.
But the thing is,

1582
01:02:59,761 --> 01:03:04,761
you know,
it's like your connection with the 

1583
01:03:04,761 --> 01:03:04,761
writing.
Sometimes it's um,

1584
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,760
it's such a hard thing to describe,
but sometimes the words come to you when

1585
01:03:08,761 --> 01:03:09,630
you're writing,
you know,

1586
01:03:09,631 --> 01:03:11,580
when you're onstage,
you're performing and you know,

1587
01:03:11,581 --> 01:03:12,120
you know,
you'll,

1588
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:14,540
you'll get in the groove and you'll bits
will come to you at a,

1589
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:17,010
out of thin air.
But there's something even crazier about

1590
01:03:17,011 --> 01:03:18,750
it when you're writing because when 
you're writing,

1591
01:03:18,751 --> 01:03:21,330
sometimes I'll get through a whole 
paragraph and then I'll go back and read

1592
01:03:21,331 --> 01:03:21,650
that.
I go,

1593
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:23,820
God damn,
where the fuck did that even come to?

1594
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:26,640
Yeah.
It's like it just came out of space.

1595
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:31,670
It's like I'm in this weird 
semi-conscious state when I'm running 

1596
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:33,630
where you're just like,
so zoned into what you're doing.

1597
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:38,840
And as you're zoned in,
the sentence is just sort of form 

1598
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,560
themselves in your head and then they 
changed their position and no,

1599
01:03:40,561 --> 01:03:41,700
this isn't in the beginning.

1600
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:44,870
And then you read it again and it offers
you another perspective.

1601
01:03:44,871 --> 01:03:46,110
Yeah,
it just all starts.

1602
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:49,050
It's like literally like you're tuning 
into something that comes out of,

1603
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:54,390
it's in the air somewhere.
It truly is like the most incredible 

1604
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:54,690
form of therapy that I could.
I mean,

1605
01:03:54,691 --> 01:03:55,450
after my,
uh,

1606
01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:57,870
my folks passed away,
people were like,

1607
01:03:57,871 --> 01:04:02,871
you should go talk to somebody.
And like I was bringing her onstage but 

1608
01:04:02,871 --> 01:04:05,901
I wasn't.
And then I started writing and then 

1609
01:04:05,901 --> 01:04:06,150
reading some of the shit that I was 
writing and realizing I didn't even know

1610
01:04:06,151 --> 01:04:09,300
I felt that because you just get in that
fucking zen place where you're like,

1611
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:12,900
I'm not even looking at the keyboard,
I'm just putting it out there.

1612
01:04:12,901 --> 01:04:14,430
And then you read back and you're like,
Oh man,

1613
01:04:14,431 --> 01:04:19,431
I didn't even realize that's how I 
connected those two things together or 

1614
01:04:19,431 --> 01:04:19,431
so.
I mean,

1615
01:04:19,431 --> 01:04:19,950
I love writing.

1616
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:23,640
It's just writing a book is tough man.
It's very important for comics too.

1617
01:04:23,641 --> 01:04:25,170
There's a lot of guys who don't like to 
write,

1618
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,840
they just liked to perform onstage,
come up with funny ideas,

1619
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:30,060
which is a great way to do it that way 
does it,

1620
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,430
but you're not going to get the best 
shit.

1621
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:37,610
Sometimes you're going to get ideas that
come to you when you sit down and just 

1622
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:39,150
write and then you could take those 
ideas of stage and fuck around with them

1623
01:04:39,151 --> 01:04:41,460
and tweak them.
But if you just try to go onstage,

1624
01:04:41,490 --> 01:04:44,170
just come up with stuff onstage.
It's not the same.

1625
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:44,530
Right?
Yeah.

1626
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:46,230
Yeah.
You have to have like a little kernel of

1627
01:04:46,231 --> 01:04:47,280
something.
I mean I can,

1628
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:49,410
I can improv if I know what I want to go
up there with,

1629
01:04:49,411 --> 01:04:51,480
but I hate getting caught.
Just leaning.

1630
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:55,190
You know when you're leaning up there 
going like what else?

1631
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,210
You find it really hard when once you 
do.

1632
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:02,300
I find it very hard once I do a special 
and then I know I have to do new shit 

1633
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:05,811
and then I'm really like piecing it 
together and I'm always doing a million 

1634
01:05:05,811 --> 01:05:05,811
different things.
Is once as as you are too.

1635
01:05:05,811 --> 01:05:07,950
I'm always doing a million different 
things so it's hard to fucking pci those

1636
01:05:07,951 --> 01:05:09,990
new shit and then you got to do a new 
show and you're like,

1637
01:05:09,991 --> 01:05:12,060
fuck these people probably already see 
my special,

1638
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:17,280
you know,
just aired fucking shit new shit that I 

1639
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:17,280
got.
I got like 40 minutes new shit.

1640
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:18,460
Bring that back.
It's 45,

1641
01:05:18,461 --> 01:05:19,460
but I don't even like that.
But you know,

1642
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:24,770
ticket things that I hate bringing stuff
back that I've done before just feels 

1643
01:05:25,391 --> 01:05:27,610
Rodan and feels like you're a shithead.
You're cheating,

1644
01:05:27,611 --> 01:05:28,170
you're,
you're,

1645
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:29,680
you're robbing them or something like 
that.

1646
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:34,710
Unless they ask for it,
if people scream for it and if I can 

1647
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:34,710
remember it,
that's a problem.

1648
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:35,620
Like some of the yellow,
like Anna Nicole Smith,

1649
01:05:35,621 --> 01:05:39,340
like I can't do it.
It's like seven minutes long and I don't

1650
01:05:39,341 --> 01:05:40,090
even know.
I know,

1651
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:41,620
I know some of the punchlines.

1652
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:45,080
This may sound super fucking cheesy or 
something like Bon Jovi would do,

1653
01:05:45,081 --> 01:05:50,081
but during my last tour I would bring 
somebody up out of the crowd and I'd be 

1654
01:05:50,081 --> 01:05:50,081
like,
you know,

1655
01:05:50,081 --> 01:05:54,371
the fucking Koolaid bit because I 
haven't done it and I'm watching them 

1656
01:05:54,891 --> 01:05:58,220
act out and they know the kick that I 
would do or the whatever,

1657
01:05:58,221 --> 01:06:01,040
physical brick and I'm just like,
this is crazy.

1658
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,250
That's actually pretty fucking cool.

1659
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:05,540
You know,
I started out doing comedy.

1660
01:06:05,541 --> 01:06:09,830
One of the reasons why I did come in the
first place was reenacting qbd and spits

1661
01:06:09,831 --> 01:06:12,350
that I saw on TV to my friends.
I was like 18,

1662
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:17,351
19.
Like I remember there was a girl that I 

1663
01:06:17,351 --> 01:06:19,871
was working with.
I was working at the Boston Athletic 

1664
01:06:19,871 --> 01:06:19,871
Club in South Boston and I was a fitness
trainer.

1665
01:06:19,871 --> 01:06:24,520
And um,
this girl that was working there had 

1666
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:25,430
seen Sam kinison on Hbo.
And so she comes up to me and she goes,

1667
01:06:25,431 --> 01:06:27,650
do you gotta see this comedian?
He's so fucking funny.

1668
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:30,530
He does this bit about.
It's the craziest thing I've ever seen.

1669
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:32,720
She gets down on her stomach in the 
parking lot,

1670
01:06:32,721 --> 01:06:37,721
doing Sam kinisons bad,
about a bit about the people having sex 

1671
01:06:37,721 --> 01:06:39,620
with the gay guys having sex with a 
corpse and he's.

1672
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:43,160
She's lying down in the parking lot at 
the athletic club and she's like,

1673
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:44,840
so here these guys are.
This is how he does it.

1674
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:47,480
He,
these guys are the line of slabs.

1675
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,590
Like,
Oh my God,

1676
01:06:48,591 --> 01:06:49,370
I'm going to go to habitat,

1677
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:50,430
be with Jesus.
Said,

1678
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:52,300
Oh,
what is this?

1679
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:56,910
I kept taking my life keeps fucking in 
the ass.

1680
01:06:56,911 --> 01:06:57,780
Even after your dad.

1681
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:04,110
She did that bit for me in the parking 
lot and I was howling laughing and I 

1682
01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:06,430
instantly became obsessed with standup 
comedy and with Sam Kennison.

1683
01:07:06,431 --> 01:07:06,960
I was like,
go,

1684
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:12,300
I have to go watch this.
This is the craziest thing I've ever 

1685
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:12,300
seen.
It took a long time to fuck.

1686
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:13,830
I gotta get a vhs copy of it.
Right?

1687
01:07:13,870 --> 01:07:15,100
And I finally got to see it.
I was like,

1688
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,150
Holy Shit.

1689
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:21,260
So that would you say would that.
That was obviously one of the moments 

1690
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:22,830
that like diff or defined your formative
years in standup comedy?

1691
01:07:22,890 --> 01:07:24,810
Yeah,
there was that and there was a,

1692
01:07:24,811 --> 01:07:26,550
when I was a little kid,
I was about 13.

1693
01:07:26,551 --> 01:07:29,630
My parents took me to see live on the 
sunset strip and uh,

1694
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:30,960
Richard Pryor.
Yeah,

1695
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:34,740
my parents were hippies and uh,
my sister was like 12.

1696
01:07:34,770 --> 01:07:39,770
She went to Shit.
And so we're in this theater and I 

1697
01:07:39,770 --> 01:07:42,090
remember laughing so fucking hard.
I couldn't believe in it.

1698
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:44,130
It's kind of funny about standup comedy 
man,

1699
01:07:44,131 --> 01:07:46,830
because Richard Pryor was one of the 
most brilliant ever for sure,

1700
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:50,130
but honestly,
when you watch it today,

1701
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,110
some of it is very dated,
you know,

1702
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:54,240
it doesn't hit me the way it hit me back
then.

1703
01:07:54,241 --> 01:07:56,340
And that's the case with music.
That's the case with a lot of things.

1704
01:07:56,550 --> 01:08:01,550
Lenny Bruce was one of the greatest I've
ever one of the most important pioneers 

1705
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:04,851
of comedy ever.
It's very hard to laugh at this stuff 

1706
01:08:04,851 --> 01:08:07,461
now because the culture changes,
people's perceptions change and comedy 

1707
01:08:07,461 --> 01:08:07,461
changes and there's.

1708
01:08:07,461 --> 01:08:12,320
The comedy that you do today would 
probably be too shocking for people who 

1709
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:15,810
lived in.
It's like comedy is defined by its 

1710
01:08:15,810 --> 01:08:16,070
certain era,
so if you go back and live in the sunset

1711
01:08:16,071 --> 01:08:21,071
strip today,
it's not going to hit me like it hit me 

1712
01:08:21,071 --> 01:08:21,071
when I was 13,
when I was 13.

1713
01:08:21,071 --> 01:08:25,211
I didn't know anything about comedy.
I couldn't believe there was someone 

1714
01:08:25,211 --> 01:08:25,820
that actually saying these there and he 
was saying it's so perfectly.

1715
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I was crying,
laughing and I remember looking around 

1716
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:31,000
at this theater,
I'll never forget this.

1717
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,170
We're moving forward and the chairs and 
rocking back and forth,

1718
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:38,410
and I was thinking,
I've never seen anyone laugh like this 

1719
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:39,300
in a movie and this guy's just talking.
I'm like,

1720
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:44,350
I was thinking about stripes.
[inaudible] stripes had been out at 

1721
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:44,350
least one of the greatest comedy movies 
ever.

1722
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:44,780
I might get stopped this funny.

1723
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:46,730
Nothing is funny.
This is crazy.

1724
01:08:46,731 --> 01:08:50,000
This guy's just talking and that.
That was the first big seed.

1725
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:52,760
That was huge.
That was just the seat of my fascination

1726
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:56,540
with standup,
but until I got people that told me that

1727
01:08:56,541 --> 01:08:58,670
I could do it,
I did not think I could do it.

1728
01:08:58,671 --> 01:09:03,671
I was doing.
I was teaching taekwondo and finding a 

1729
01:09:03,671 --> 01:09:03,671
tournament's and these guys that I train
with,

1730
01:09:03,671 --> 01:09:08,320
I would make them laugh in the locker 
room and on the way the tournament's 

1731
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:08,320
because everybody was scared on the way 
to tournaments.

1732
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:12,311
We were all good.
We're going to get kicked and punched 

1733
01:09:12,311 --> 01:09:14,321
and shit.
It's fucking terrifying and a lot of 

1734
01:09:14,321 --> 01:09:16,151
guys got knocked out and you get to see 
your friends get knocked unconscious by 

1735
01:09:16,151 --> 01:09:17,030
getting kicked in the head.
So there was a lot of like gallows humor

1736
01:09:17,031 --> 01:09:17,870
on these trips,
you know,

1737
01:09:17,871 --> 01:09:22,871
we were just trying,
so I would always be the guy that would 

1738
01:09:22,871 --> 01:09:23,110
like do impressions of all the different
teammates having sex and all that stupid

1739
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:26,390
shit and that's how I got to talk to,
to doing standup comedy,

1740
01:09:26,391 --> 01:09:27,830
man.
But fuck it.

1741
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:32,831
Some stand up comedy.
It's got to be one of the fucking 

1742
01:09:32,831 --> 01:09:35,261
weirdest jobs to ever enter in every 
because no one could tell you how to do 

1743
01:09:35,261 --> 01:09:35,261
it.
Yeah.

1744
01:09:35,261 --> 01:09:35,990
I'm trying to tell other people what it 
really is.

1745
01:09:35,991 --> 01:09:37,070
We could talk all day.

1746
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:42,830
You know when you're,
when you're at your best,

1747
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:45,050
when you're locked on onstage and 
crushing,

1748
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:47,150
don't you feel?
Or do you feel,

1749
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:50,000
because this is how I feel,
I feel like I'm just writing it.

1750
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:52,700
I feel like I'm a passenger,
you know,

1751
01:09:52,701 --> 01:09:54,530
I feel like I'm tuned into this whole 
thing,

1752
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,620
but I feel like as everything's coming 
out and I'm hitting all the things,

1753
01:09:57,770 --> 01:09:59,570
it's almost like I'm just,
I'm just,

1754
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:01,000
I'm on autopilot.
I'm in,

1755
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:04,640
I'm in some crazy groove where I'm 
getting to watch this and I'm getting to

1756
01:10:04,641 --> 01:10:06,860
experience the words coming out of my 
mouth as they happen.

1757
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:09,890
I have no idea how the fuck it's all 
working so smoothly.

1758
01:10:09,891 --> 01:10:11,390
I really can't even take credit for it.

1759
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:16,560
That's interesting because I like,
I can't speak anywhere nears flawlessly 

1760
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:19,450
is when I'm on stage.
If I tried to tell you a bit,

1761
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:24,570
I will stammer.
I will fucking not remember and I can 

1762
01:10:24,570 --> 01:10:25,540
groove on stage sometimes like surfing 
where you're like,

1763
01:10:25,570 --> 01:10:28,840
I don't know how I'm staying up.
Wave for an hour.

1764
01:10:28,841 --> 01:10:29,440
Just like

1765
01:10:30,270 --> 01:10:35,270
just that intensity that there's,
there's an intensity of communicating 

1766
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:35,270
with people,
you know,

1767
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:39,750
just like every cylinder,
everything in your brain fires up and it

1768
01:10:39,751 --> 01:10:40,050
cranked.

1769
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:43,160
There's that Steve Martin Accordion born
standing up where he goes,

1770
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:48,050
I can feel it in my fingernails.
I point out I can feel it in my foot the

1771
01:10:48,051 --> 01:10:51,680
way it just moves and plants.
I can see every part of my body.

1772
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,870
It feels like it's emitting fucking 
standup.

1773
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,120
Yeah.
He hated being a standard.

1774
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:58,210
Oh my God.
He hated his.

1775
01:10:58,211 --> 01:11:03,211
The adulation that came when it became 
immediately gigantically successful and 

1776
01:11:03,211 --> 01:11:05,860
he couldn't get an honest response from 
people anymore.

1777
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:10,920
They would start screaming and cheering 
as soon as they saw him and he would do 

1778
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:13,951
these gigantic arenas that he couldn't 
control and they were just totally out 

1779
01:11:13,951 --> 01:11:13,951
of control.
Right.

1780
01:11:13,951 --> 01:11:14,280
Which happens to a lot of guys when they
get big.

1781
01:11:14,281 --> 01:11:14,640
Like,
you know,

1782
01:11:14,641 --> 01:11:19,641
Chappelle when he was touring,
he would be really frustrated when he 

1783
01:11:19,641 --> 01:11:23,760
went after the Rick James Sketch sketch 
came out because people will be yelling 

1784
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:24,450
out everywhere.
I'm Rick James Bitch.

1785
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:29,690
He'd be in the middle of setups on like 
James Bitch and they couldn't kick out 

1786
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:29,690
enough people.
It was just,

1787
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:30,150
it was too nutty.

1788
01:11:30,230 --> 01:11:32,060
That's the,
that to me honestly,

1789
01:11:32,090 --> 01:11:36,020
when dice was at his peak when I first 
was watching the HBO specials,

1790
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:41,500
you know,
I was young comedian specials and then 

1791
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:41,500
he had that.
I remember feeling like,

1792
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:45,440
how the fuck can I do this but not be a 
character?

1793
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:48,920
How can I do this and be as real still 
be an entertainer,

1794
01:11:48,921 --> 01:11:53,921
still be on but be as much me.
So there's none of that fucking 

1795
01:11:53,921 --> 01:11:55,970
catchphrase.
Got to see people,

1796
01:11:56,060 --> 01:12:01,060
you know,
everybody wants to be a little Mark 

1797
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:01,060
Twain.
You want your Shit quoted?

1798
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:01,060
Yes.
But not like that.

1799
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:03,260
Not like that.
Not a t shirt.

1800
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:05,330
Do you keep that weird feeling?
Huh?

1801
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:10,440
You know,
it's also like when you are first 

1802
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:13,001
starting out to accommodate,
how old were you when you first got 

1803
01:12:13,001 --> 01:12:13,001
onto?
Nineteen?

1804
01:12:13,001 --> 01:12:13,550
Was 18,
18 and 19.

1805
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:15,250
I was,
um,

1806
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:19,130
I was 21 and I was not a fully formed 
person yet,

1807
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:20,540
you know.
So it's like,

1808
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:24,560
you know,
when you're on stage yet either.

1809
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:27,700
I'm sure when I'm 60 I'll look back at 
myself now and go with the fucking shit.

1810
01:12:27,701 --> 01:12:29,430
Were you talking stupid?
You know,

1811
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:31,000
you know that feeling,
but I,

1812
01:12:31,001 --> 01:12:32,780
I know that,
you know,

1813
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:37,840
I did not have anything to say.
There was no reason for me to be there 

1814
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:37,840
talking.
There's,

1815
01:12:37,970 --> 01:12:40,760
I really didn't know who the fuck I was.
I didn't know what I was saying.

1816
01:12:40,761 --> 01:12:43,280
I could show you how to kick somebody in
the face.

1817
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:47,030
I really didn't have any opinions that 
were valid on anything else.

1818
01:12:47,390 --> 01:12:48,140
I mean,
what the fuck?

1819
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:50,420
What's my opinion on anything?
I could tell you something silly.

1820
01:12:50,421 --> 01:12:52,330
My girlfriend did want,
she was blown may or something.

1821
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:53,600
I could,
you know,

1822
01:12:53,601 --> 01:12:56,830
that's it.
But other than that we'll fuck.

1823
01:12:56,860 --> 01:12:57,550
How are you?

1824
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,100
And I threw it off a little bit because 
you were saying like,

1825
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:03,960
so then when chappelle started doing the
bigger shows because yeah.

1826
01:13:03,961 --> 01:13:06,310
Even Steve Martin,
he lost control of the fucking.

1827
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:08,850
Did you what?
How quick was the jump between you doing

1828
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:10,740
clubs and you're doing these giant 
places?

1829
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:11,700
Giant arenas.

1830
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:16,010
It was actually a slow but steady 
trajectory where when that web stuff,

1831
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:21,520
what happened was this in 2001,
my first real website that I put up in 

1832
01:13:21,561 --> 01:13:26,561
combination of napster starting to get 
hot and me uploading all my shit too 

1833
01:13:26,561 --> 01:13:31,331
that with the link I literally uploaded 
clips with me at the end going visit 

1834
01:13:31,331 --> 01:13:33,740
[inaudible] dot com at the end of every 
22nd clip.

1835
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:39,520
Then comedy central,
I did a half hour presents that I 

1836
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:39,520
thought,
what are fucking taught?

1837
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:39,520
I'm like,
okay,

1838
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:42,200
there's the one with you and the tank 
top tank top dude.

1839
01:13:42,201 --> 01:13:43,040
I thought,
all right,

1840
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:46,250
you don't want this whole air.
A couple of times maybe I got to light a

1841
01:13:46,251 --> 01:13:51,251
fire.
Were to bowling fucking shirt with the 

1842
01:13:51,251 --> 01:13:53,831
car.
I don't want to look like what anybody 

1843
01:13:53,831 --> 01:13:53,831
else did.
I just want to do some crazy shit.

1844
01:13:53,831 --> 01:13:57,371
Maybe people fucking pay attention.
Never realized that they were going to 

1845
01:13:57,371 --> 01:13:59,720
air it five times a week for like two 
years.

1846
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:05,500
It built my whole fan base in almost 
immediately went from a few hundred 

1847
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:05,500
seaters to,
you know,

1848
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:09,560
a couple thousand and that I'm doing all
the college stuff and over three,

1849
01:14:09,561 --> 01:14:10,430
four,
five years.

1850
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,610
The,
the

1851
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:17,640
instant messages during those schools 
renting out the arenas at the schools 

1852
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:18,000
and it just built.

1853
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:21,600
How much time do you spend everyday 
talking to fans,

1854
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:22,920
emailing,
you know,

1855
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:24,600
facebook and twitter and all that shit.

1856
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:25,920
I'll tell you man,
I don't.

1857
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:29,230
I used to talk to everybody.
I used to reply to everybody.

1858
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:33,700
If that was at the beginning,
that was from 2000 2005.

1859
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:39,060
That's really what I did most of my day.
And then it got to a point where you 

1860
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:41,530
don't need to read all the fucking crazy
shit that comes back and you know,

1861
01:14:41,531 --> 01:14:46,531
there's just too,
too many opinions and too much 

1862
01:14:46,531 --> 01:14:49,051
negativity.
So it came down to I'm replying to 

1863
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:51,661
troops.
If I get letters for like and I can 

1864
01:14:51,661 --> 01:14:51,661
check check by the email somebody,
you know,

1865
01:14:51,661 --> 01:14:54,340
one of our troops rights or if it's like
a kid I write back.

1866
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:59,770
I've been trawling as a kid for years.
So don't assume I agree with that.

1867
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:07,690
Twelve year old gets advice from him.

1868
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:09,220
No,
but it took a while,

1869
01:15:09,221 --> 01:15:10,780
man.
It was not like everybody.

1870
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:13,930
There's that old expression or took 20 
years to be an overnight sensation.

1871
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,570
It was a long time man.
It was not.

1872
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:19,510
It was not as instant.
Maybe as some people thought it's got to

1873
01:15:19,511 --> 01:15:20,140
be satisfying

1874
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:25,210
though to know that you know,
you went out here and you did some 

1875
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:26,010
movies and shit and some things didn't 
connect and didn't happen well for you,

1876
01:15:26,011 --> 01:15:30,030
but you did it all on your own.
Like everything was done through your,

1877
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:33,180
your own.
Figuring out how to self help,

1878
01:15:33,181 --> 01:15:36,480
self promote and you changed everybody's
attitude about it.

1879
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:41,610
No,
comics are good promoters except I mean 

1880
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:41,610
there's a few.
It's very rare.

1881
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:42,340
But until you came along,
no.

1882
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:44,280
Comics were really good at self 
promotion.

1883
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:45,890
Totally changed my attitude towards

1884
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:47,280
you learn that from your father.
Right?

1885
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:48,570
I did,
man.

1886
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:51,260
A couple of things that I want to give 
credit to joe too,

1887
01:15:51,270 --> 01:15:54,120
and I told you this a long time ago,
like you were the first person to have a

1888
01:15:54,121 --> 01:15:59,121
website,
not only your website but you had cool 

1889
01:15:59,121 --> 01:15:59,121
shit on your website,
man.

1890
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:00,300
You got fucking cool designs and fucking
that as a director,

1891
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:05,310
result of my obsession with quake 
because I was obsessed with quake and I 

1892
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:06,760
ran into this Guy Andrew,
who is this guy that I met online.

1893
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:08,980
Wait clan.
Just how fucked up I was.

1894
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:11,950
I'd have all these dudes online from 
like Kentucky in Oklahoma.

1895
01:16:12,070 --> 01:16:14,770
They would come a fly to California and 
stay at my house.

1896
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:20,000
This is when I was on news radio.
It was on TV and dudes would come over 

1897
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,161
my house that I didn't know from were 
just my quick buddies and they would 

1898
01:16:23,161 --> 01:16:24,190
come over and stay at the house and I'm 
not bullshitting.

1899
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:26,440
I had like five dudes come over my house
and we had a land party.

1900
01:16:26,730 --> 01:16:31,730
I was so obsessed with this that I.
I put a t one line in my house because 

1901
01:16:31,730 --> 01:16:32,770
back then you couldn't get any fast 
internet.

1902
01:16:32,771 --> 01:16:34,330
You get ISD,
which is not quick enough,

1903
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:35,230
so I said,
okay,

1904
01:16:35,231 --> 01:16:37,030
how much is the t one line?
It was a thousand dollars a month.

1905
01:16:37,031 --> 01:16:37,900
I'm like,
let's do this.

1906
01:16:37,901 --> 01:16:42,901
Okay,
so they fucking have to install this 

1907
01:16:42,901 --> 01:16:42,901
business grade internet lines.

1908
01:16:42,901 --> 01:16:42,901
That's why you.

1909
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,630
I was completely bought into the 33 six,
but what is,

1910
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:55,220
it's Your Ping,
your pink time was you could be on 56 K,

1911
01:16:55,221 --> 01:16:56,690
but if you're really close to the server
you're paying.

1912
01:16:57,430 --> 01:16:59,870
It's all in how fast.
It's all really just how much you do it,

1913
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:01,260
you know,
just become obsessed with sure.

1914
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:07,740
You start to know your frame rates and 
where you're going to fucking click and 

1915
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:07,740
bounce them.

1916
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:11,500
So dangerous.
Getting really addicted to things like 

1917
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:11,500
that.
You lose your life.

1918
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:11,500
Yeah,
right.

1919
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:13,880
Do you worry about doing shit like that?
Like things that are,

1920
01:17:13,881 --> 01:17:15,710
that eat away your time,
relationships,

1921
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,180
marijuana,
relationships,

1922
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:19,550
dare you.

1923
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:20,750
No.
I mean,

1924
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,620
listen for me,
all I ever ate,

1925
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:25,130
all I ever wanted to do is create.
That's it.

1926
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:26,460
I,
I'm not,

1927
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,680
I don't have any other fucking 
abilities.

1928
01:17:29,670 --> 01:17:30,570
Uh,
you know,

1929
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:35,820
I really just,
when I was a kid I had that epiphany 

1930
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:38,511
moment where I was like,
all I really care about is being around 

1931
01:17:38,511 --> 01:17:38,511
performers,
talking about performing,

1932
01:17:38,511 --> 01:17:39,060
talking about,
you know,

1933
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:42,480
making something from nothing.
And you brought up my dad was like,

1934
01:17:42,481 --> 01:17:45,780
that's my favorite conversations in life
were with him because he was the kind of

1935
01:17:45,781 --> 01:17:46,980
guy who go,
yeah,

1936
01:17:46,981 --> 01:17:47,550
I don't,
you know,

1937
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:48,680
you're a lot of talk,
Dane,

1938
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:50,220
uh,
I want to see shit.

1939
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,400
And it was like he was just motivating 
men.

1940
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:54,060
That's important,

1941
01:17:54,090 --> 01:17:55,170
man.
That's important.

1942
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:57,540
Having people that don't totally 
completely believe in you,

1943
01:17:57,870 --> 01:17:59,520
you know,
it is absolutely important.

1944
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:00,980
The mom was like,
oh,

1945
01:18:00,981 --> 01:18:02,900
I think you're the greatest.
You're the best you shoes.

1946
01:18:02,901 --> 01:18:05,960
So fucking Uber supportive.
But my dad was like,

1947
01:18:05,961 --> 01:18:07,520
yeah,
you're not a,

1948
01:18:07,610 --> 01:18:08,780
you're not really doing anything

1949
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:13,840
in order for you to develop the kind of 
fortitude that you're gonna need to get 

1950
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:14,390
through the hard times.
You have to have something to prove.

1951
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:16,190
That's what I think.
I think it's too hard.

1952
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:18,860
If you don't,
it's too hard to really push yourself.

1953
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:19,560
Right.
You know,

1954
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:24,910
if you don't have a chip on your 
shoulder or something to prove or some 

1955
01:18:24,910 --> 01:18:25,040
gap to fill,
you're not gonna you're not gonna do it.

1956
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:27,380
Can I get through that?
Think about all the guys that we started

1957
01:18:27,381 --> 01:18:32,381
out with that we're just as good as us.
There was a lot of guys that were very 

1958
01:18:32,381 --> 01:18:32,381
commensurate.
There were all really.

1959
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,760
Think of them happened to that guy.
Fuck man.

1960
01:18:34,761 --> 01:18:37,130
Like I used to kill.
He used to have this one bit and used to

1961
01:18:37,131 --> 01:18:40,370
destroy and they just could see that guy
on evening at the Improv.

1962
01:18:40,371 --> 01:18:41,480
I could see that guy,
you know,

1963
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:45,620
Ryan headlining and he just stopped,
stopped down at girls too.

1964
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:46,880
There was this chick,
Leon Lewis.

1965
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:47,730
Um,
I,

1966
01:18:47,731 --> 01:18:49,430
I was an open mic or with her.
Do you remember her?

1967
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:53,330
She had some fucking good bits,
man.

1968
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:56,190
She was still trying to figure out how 
to go on stage and had developed.

1969
01:18:56,230 --> 01:18:57,200
But as a comic,
like,

1970
01:18:57,230 --> 01:18:58,880
as a,
as a chick to especially,

1971
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:02,850
it was very like honest and out of 
nowhere and like,

1972
01:19:03,190 --> 01:19:04,490
well written shit.
I was like,

1973
01:19:04,491 --> 01:19:05,870
wow,
this chick's got huge someday.

1974
01:19:05,930 --> 01:19:06,710
I'm like,
she's going to be like,

1975
01:19:06,711 --> 01:19:09,200
eleanor just disappeared.
Just fell off.

1976
01:19:09,230 --> 01:19:11,660
Just where'd you go?
It's weird.

1977
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:15,470
It's weird.
There's so many fucking so many slots.

1978
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:18,920
So many people going towards these slots
and some of them just,

1979
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:22,130
it's just too far up though the salmon 
ladder that just fuck this.

1980
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:23,540
Just can't do it.

1981
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:28,820
Dan,
you should use your Hollywood 

1982
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:30,441
connections to get a.
John Hughes was just about to release 

1983
01:19:30,441 --> 01:19:34,911
the extra hour of planes,
trains and automobiles that they filmed 

1984
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:35,580
right before he died.
That what happened to that?

1985
01:19:35,581 --> 01:19:36,910
Now it's done.

1986
01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:41,990
It's probably all in the family.
The family probably owns it and they 

1987
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:41,990
have to figure out the rights if that's 
what he wanted.

1988
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:42,780
I'm sure they'll probably release it 
still.

1989
01:19:42,781 --> 01:19:44,050
Why would they want to keep it?
Well,

1990
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:45,150
they've kept it for what,

1991
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:46,570
20 years,
you know,

1992
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:48,070
he,
he wasn't going to release it ever,

1993
01:19:48,071 --> 01:19:49,930
but then just recently he was thinking 
about it.

1994
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:55,340
Oh,
well I don't know that unless it was in 

1995
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:58,941
as well.
Who knows what the fuck's going to 

1996
01:19:58,941 --> 01:19:58,941
happen?

1997
01:19:58,941 --> 01:19:58,941
I was telling you before that,
um,

1998
01:19:58,941 --> 01:19:59,440
you know,
one Steve Martin moment.

1999
01:19:59,441 --> 01:20:03,040
That was really because I,
I had dinner with them like a few months

2000
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:04,420
ago.
He sent me a copy of his book.

2001
01:20:04,810 --> 01:20:07,350
I was completely blown away,
but I'd never him.

2002
01:20:07,351 --> 01:20:09,300
I heard all this stuff about him that 
he's Kinda like,

2003
01:20:09,490 --> 01:20:10,500
you know,
maybe not,

2004
01:20:10,590 --> 01:20:12,030
you know,
he's a little socially awkward,

2005
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:13,470
all this shit and what a trip.

2006
01:20:13,470 --> 01:20:15,060
But as being someone that famous right

2007
01:20:15,470 --> 01:20:18,650
meeting really your hero to which you 
don't want to do by the way,

2008
01:20:18,651 --> 01:20:20,030
you usually meet your heroes and you're 
like,

2009
01:20:20,031 --> 01:20:22,150
oh,
that was sucked.

2010
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:23,930
But with him I was like,
all right,

2011
01:20:23,931 --> 01:20:26,840
you sent me a copy of his book and I,
I wrote back just to be like,

2012
01:20:26,841 --> 01:20:29,300
can I,
could I take you out to lunch?

2013
01:20:29,301 --> 01:20:34,301
And he agreed and so I sat down with 
them for a little bit and he's really 

2014
01:20:34,301 --> 01:20:34,600
real.
Like I'm,

2015
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:36,040
I can be shy,
I can,

2016
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:41,170
I don't know about shy,
but I can still be like a little bit 

2017
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:41,170
quiet.
But he's very much like,

2018
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:42,830
he won't say a word,
I don't think if you don't,

2019
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:44,510
if you don't start the conversation with
him.

2020
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:46,460
Wow.
But he did say to me at one point,

2021
01:20:46,461 --> 01:20:47,270
he goes,
uh,

2022
01:20:47,570 --> 01:20:49,880
he looked at me Kinda like perplexing is
like,

2023
01:20:49,881 --> 01:20:51,800
you look like you really love it up 
there.

2024
01:20:52,010 --> 01:20:52,990
And I was like,
yeah,

2025
01:20:52,991 --> 01:20:53,690
no,
I really,

2026
01:20:53,691 --> 01:20:54,510
I really do.
You know,

2027
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:56,020
when you're in the middle of it.
And I started kind of.

2028
01:20:56,021 --> 01:20:56,510
And he goes,
yeah,

2029
01:20:56,511 --> 01:21:00,430
I never had that.
Never.

2030
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:01,760
I go,
not even at the end.

2031
01:21:01,761 --> 01:21:03,320
He goes,
I never had that.

2032
01:21:03,321 --> 01:21:05,930
I never felt connected when I found out.
I thought that,

2033
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:11,280
yeah,
after that so strange what I have least 

2034
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:11,280
in common with Steve Martin's comedy.

2035
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,670
What?
I wonder if his phrasing.

2036
01:21:13,170 --> 01:21:15,290
I wonder if it's just got some weird 
connect in his mind.

2037
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:18,200
Maybe he's depressed.
Maybe a naturally depressed person.

2038
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:19,840
Well,
if you read a lot,

2039
01:21:19,870 --> 01:21:22,150
I read a lot of this stuff in the New 
Yorker when he would write.

2040
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:23,350
Oh yeah.
It's depressing shit.

2041
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:24,010
Yeah,
man.

2042
01:21:24,011 --> 01:21:27,700
That letter to my father that says all 
men.

2043
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:27,700
And

2044
01:21:27,790 --> 01:21:29,740
I was telling Brian this,
I was going to bring this up,

2045
01:21:29,741 --> 01:21:30,400
but fuck it.
When,

2046
01:21:30,401 --> 01:21:35,401
when Phil Hartman was alive,
Phil Hartman was really good friends 

2047
01:21:35,401 --> 01:21:35,650
with Steve Martin.
And Phil Hartman was going to a set,

2048
01:21:35,710 --> 01:21:37,620
Steve Martin up with a,
what I call it,

2049
01:21:37,621 --> 01:21:42,621
coyote when coyote is,
is these really kind of crafty 

2050
01:21:42,621 --> 01:21:47,550
professional chicks that will fuck 
celebrity guys in order to try to get 

2051
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:48,130
famous,
try to figure out some way.

2052
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:51,520
And this is pre TMZ,
you know now and now it's like,

2053
01:21:51,521 --> 01:21:53,560
you know,
you really can fuck someone and all of a

2054
01:21:53,561 --> 01:21:55,390
sudden become hugely famous.
That girl,

2055
01:21:55,570 --> 01:21:57,040
that Jesse James Girl,
what's her name?

2056
01:21:57,041 --> 01:21:59,080
Bombshell.
I'm the Mel Gibson girl.

2057
01:21:59,170 --> 01:21:59,740
Yeah,
that girl.

2058
01:21:59,741 --> 01:22:00,640
Exactly,
exactly.

2059
01:22:00,641 --> 01:22:05,641
And then all of a sudden that,
that actually can parlay into some sort 

2060
01:22:05,641 --> 01:22:05,641
of something.
I mean,

2061
01:22:05,641 --> 01:22:06,940
who knows the fuck you can do,
but you people have your name.

2062
01:22:06,941 --> 01:22:07,960
They know who the fuck right now.

2063
01:22:08,410 --> 01:22:10,630
And she was one of those.
She was just kind of creepy.

2064
01:22:10,631 --> 01:22:14,350
It's just like very insincere but really
hot and just really beautiful.

2065
01:22:14,351 --> 01:22:16,630
But you know,
just something vacuous there.

2066
01:22:16,790 --> 01:22:21,790
And uh,
Phil was going to set Steve Martin up 

2067
01:22:21,790 --> 01:22:21,790
with her and uh,
I forget who it was.

2068
01:22:21,790 --> 01:22:24,340
One of the cast members was like,
that is the creepiest thing ever.

2069
01:22:24,610 --> 01:22:26,530
He's like setting her up with a 
murderer.

2070
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:29,050
He's like,
and this is before obviously Phil's wife

2071
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:30,670
killed him.
He's like,

2072
01:22:30,671 --> 01:22:31,750
this,
this woman does not.

2073
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:36,780
She's not into him like,
she's like looking at it as an 

2074
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:36,780
opportunity.
She's like a little assassin.

2075
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:37,570
She's gonna move in.
I was like,

2076
01:22:37,571 --> 01:22:38,530
Whoa,
that is creepy.

2077
01:22:38,610 --> 01:22:40,910
And then I started thinking of Ms Dot 
coyotes from then on,

2078
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,790
like because that's how coyote is like,
look at your cat.

2079
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,550
They accounting like we got here,
bitch.

2080
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:50,200
I just gotta figure out a way to get,
you know those skybar chicks.

2081
01:22:50,690 --> 01:22:55,690
Will you ever go to the Sky Bar?
And once in a while cross street from 

2082
01:22:55,690 --> 01:22:55,690
the comedy store.
We would always go there because it'd be

2083
01:22:55,690 --> 01:22:56,230
really easy.
You just walk across the street and grab

2084
01:22:56,231 --> 01:22:58,720
a drink and there was always like this 
conversation.

2085
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:00,750
Do you do coke?
Sometimes,

2086
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:02,800
like always.
That's the whole,

2087
01:23:02,830 --> 01:23:07,830
the whole conversation.
He was like producers trying to talk 

2088
01:23:07,830 --> 01:23:10,540
starlets into bed and coyotes preying on
like balding Jewish man with money.

2089
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:13,970
I always hear her right for her.

2090
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:19,640
How much of a mind fuck is it

2091
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:24,640
when you actually met Steve Martin?
What is it when you're sitting there 

2092
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:24,640
talking to them like,
isn't it like,

2093
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:26,000
Holy Shit,
how does this happen?

2094
01:23:26,150 --> 01:23:27,740
How can this be real?
Am I really.

2095
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:33,220
I met Gene Simmons.
He came to my new year's show and I was 

2096
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:34,010
like,
Gene Simmons is at my show.

2097
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:39,220
Like this is insane.
Like I saw kiss a bunch of times as a 

2098
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:39,470
kid.
I saw them in the seventies.

2099
01:23:39,471 --> 01:23:42,260
My uncle used to work for Howard marks 
advertising,

2100
01:23:42,261 --> 01:23:44,150
which was a company that did their album
covers,

2101
01:23:44,210 --> 01:23:46,580
so I got to meet ace freely when I was 
eight years old,

2102
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:48,830
so I got to see them when I was really 
young.

2103
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:50,720
I got to see him live in concert.
Then I got to see him,

2104
01:23:50,721 --> 01:23:53,240
Kevin Jameson.
I went twice in the nineties.

2105
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,560
We were like,
Holy Shit.

2106
01:23:54,590 --> 01:23:57,770
Two nights in a row we're seeing a kiss.
I mean fucking huge fan.

2107
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:01,940
So all of a sudden gene semis is at my 
show and I'm shitting my pants.

2108
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:05,990
I was like really nervous for the first 
time in front of one of my crowds.

2109
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:09,560
I mean,
everyone's there specifically to see me,

2110
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:10,100
but

2111
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:12,310
fucking gene simmons is one of them.
I'm like,

2112
01:24:12,311 --> 01:24:15,460
hold on.
ICON is going to be entertained by you

2113
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:17,400
about it.
I had to talk about it right away.

2114
01:24:17,401 --> 01:24:18,690
I'm like,
if I don't get this out right away,

2115
01:24:18,691 --> 01:24:20,580
that's going to be fucking with my head 
the entire time.

2116
01:24:20,581 --> 01:24:21,210
I'm on stage.

2117
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:22,940
Junior highschool,
motley crue.

2118
01:24:22,941 --> 01:24:23,830
I was listening to,
you know,

2119
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,100
shout at the devil,
and it was like,

2120
01:24:25,101 --> 01:24:30,101
that was my anthem and I fucking went 
crew and two years ago I'm at the laugh 

2121
01:24:30,101 --> 01:24:32,870
factory and all of a sudden a madman 
starts fucking running around the crowd.

2122
01:24:32,871 --> 01:24:36,860
It's Tommy Lee and I found out he's my 
biggest fan ever.

2123
01:24:37,130 --> 01:24:37,380
Wow.

2124
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:42,940
And here's the fucked up thing.
I will go to Motley crue and do devil 

2125
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:45,191
science and I had the [inaudible] thing.
He's fucking doing what I was doing at 

2126
01:24:45,191 --> 01:24:47,350
his fucking show to me in front of the 
fucking life.

2127
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:48,590
Adrian,
I'm doing the same thing.

2128
01:24:48,591 --> 01:24:48,920
I'm going,

2129
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:53,880
this is fucking wrong.
This is too fucking is the matrix man.

2130
01:24:54,030 --> 01:24:57,140
I met Tommy Lee and I was so shocked 
that he even knew who the fuck I was.

2131
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:58,410
I was like,
this is the weirdest.

2132
01:24:58,411 --> 01:24:59,850
He loves comedy man.
He's like,

2133
01:24:59,851 --> 01:25:01,620
he's into it.
He's fucking.

2134
01:25:01,650 --> 01:25:06,650
He loves comics.
He wants to or he wanted to at the time 

2135
01:25:06,650 --> 01:25:07,140
fight kid rock and he wanted me to get 
him a trainer.

2136
01:25:08,190 --> 01:25:11,400
He decided he needed to fight kid rock.
Forget Pamela Anderson's honor.

2137
01:25:11,970 --> 01:25:13,920
So he was talking to me about like,
who's a good trainer?

2138
01:25:13,921 --> 01:25:15,060
I'm like,
we can get you a trainer.

2139
01:25:15,090 --> 01:25:17,500
Like what you want to do Jujitsu,
you want to kick box?

2140
01:25:17,501 --> 01:25:19,990
We don't need to tell standing.
I,

2141
01:25:21,030 --> 01:25:22,710
Tommy,
Tommy Lee and kid rock.

2142
01:25:22,711 --> 01:25:25,490
That would have been one of the 
satisfying of all times though.

2143
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:26,500
Like at a musical,
I,

2144
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:28,920
somebody punched somebody.
I think kid rock probably punched him,

2145
01:25:29,510 --> 01:25:29,870
I think.

2146
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:32,790
I don't know who would win that fight,
but kid rock,

2147
01:25:32,850 --> 01:25:35,460
he's got that crazy white trash thing 
going on.

2148
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:37,400
You have to kill them,
you know?

2149
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:38,750
You know what I'm saying?
Like you,

2150
01:25:38,751 --> 01:25:39,840
you know,
you think,

2151
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:41,040
you know,
you think he's down.

2152
01:25:41,041 --> 01:25:41,880
You're like,
we're done.

2153
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:43,170
We're fucking done here,
right?

2154
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:43,710
Yeah,
yeah.

2155
01:25:43,711 --> 01:25:48,711
We're done.
We're done in the head with a bottle or 

2156
01:25:50,281 --> 01:25:51,220
something.
You know,

2157
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:52,980
he's out of his mind.
I would.

2158
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:54,810
I would probably have to bank on kid 
rock there.

2159
01:25:54,870 --> 01:25:55,300
Yeah,
I'd go.

2160
01:25:55,530 --> 01:25:57,150
I'd go kid rock.
But you know what?

2161
01:25:57,151 --> 01:25:59,100
Scrap Tommy's a long,
tall guy.

2162
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:04,160
He's got a good straight right.
If somebody teaches them how to throw 

2163
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:04,160
it,
he's a drummer,

2164
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:04,160
drummer,
parents,

2165
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:04,160
man.

2166
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,420
All that shit.
That's the difference.

2167
01:26:05,421 --> 01:26:08,360
It's like a speed bag all day.
Tommy might fucking boxes.

2168
01:26:08,361 --> 01:26:10,800
Eyes off.
Paint.

2169
01:26:10,930 --> 01:26:12,740
Paint,
paint for a drummer too.

2170
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:13,560
People forget that.
Oh,

2171
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:14,600
is a real drummer.
Yeah.

2172
01:26:14,690 --> 01:26:16,050
Yeah.
But how much does he drop?

2173
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:16,940
He's a drummer,
like,

2174
01:26:17,110 --> 01:26:19,040
you know,
not consistently pool,

2175
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:24,280
right?
Know he's not a God damn professional 

2176
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:24,280
out there beating it for Motley crue.
Right?

2177
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:25,670
It takes a lot of God damn endurance the
drum.

2178
01:26:25,910 --> 01:26:27,200
You know,
you ever tried drumming?

2179
01:26:27,710 --> 01:26:29,010
What are you doing?
It's fake sleep.

2180
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:33,190
Such a silly fuck for the folks on 
Itunes,

2181
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:35,040
facebook,
or a fake a.

2182
01:26:35,810 --> 01:26:39,890
That was a stoner purchase.
It was $7 for four different sleeves.

2183
01:26:39,970 --> 01:26:40,960
I've got ahold shirt.
Lauren,

2184
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:43,040
you got a whole shirt,
like somebody sent it to me.

2185
01:26:43,041 --> 01:26:43,520
He's like,
man,

2186
01:26:43,521 --> 01:26:45,830
isn't this the fucking coolest?
Like I would wear it and I was like,

2187
01:26:45,831 --> 01:26:47,150
what are you talking about?

2188
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:50,600
It's tight.
It's flashy designer tights.

2189
01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:56,030
That's all it is.
It's like you're wearing a rash guard 

2190
01:26:56,030 --> 01:26:56,030
house,
but it brought out my falcon cuff,

2191
01:26:56,030 --> 01:26:57,120
you know like the Eddie wearable falcon 
cuff.

2192
01:26:57,740 --> 01:27:02,740
Joe.
Did you ever get to as far as just 

2193
01:27:02,740 --> 01:27:05,230
comics that you fucking dog coming up?
Did you ever get to do shows with like 

2194
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:06,130
know,
I don't know who you're.

2195
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:07,960
Steve Martin was where like a Kennedy 
Center.

2196
01:27:07,970 --> 01:27:12,970
One of those guys like Tom,
I rare is the closest I got to do shows 

2197
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:14,120
with dom at the comedy store.
That was big to me because I paid to see

2198
01:27:14,121 --> 01:27:18,500
don before ever did comedy and for 
people who don't know dot Merera fuck in

2199
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:20,240
the late eighties and the early 
nineties,

2200
01:27:20,241 --> 01:27:22,400
he was a monster.
He still very funny guy,

2201
01:27:22,401 --> 01:27:25,400
but for whatever reason he doesn't get 
as much attention as you know.

2202
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:27,680
I think his act deserves went back then 
he was,

2203
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:28,490
you know,
really,

2204
01:27:28,491 --> 01:27:29,960
really popular and I paid to see him.

2205
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:34,960
I was living in Boston.
I took my girlfriend to see him at 

2206
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:36,710
Nick's comedy stop and I had never gone 
on stage yet and all of a sudden,

2207
01:27:36,711 --> 01:27:38,270
you know,
in Montreal at the comedy festival,

2208
01:27:38,271 --> 01:27:40,190
it's like I'm working with them.
Holy Shit.

2209
01:27:40,191 --> 01:27:42,880
And there's only like six years later,
seven years later,

2210
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:44,360
whatever.
It was really fresh in my mind.

2211
01:27:44,361 --> 01:27:45,230
I was like,
holy fuck,

2212
01:27:45,231 --> 01:27:50,231
like I paid to see this guy and now I'm 
working with them like we're doing a 

2213
01:27:50,231 --> 01:27:50,231
show together,
you know,

2214
01:27:50,231 --> 01:27:54,551
or were pulled on the bill.
It's like people are coming to see him 

2215
01:27:54,551 --> 01:27:54,551
and they come see me.
Like,

2216
01:27:54,551 --> 01:27:55,100
what?
That's crazy,

2217
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:56,460
but you know,
that's not like,

2218
01:27:56,600 --> 01:28:01,600
you know,
he became a friend and it became normal 

2219
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:02,590
after a while,
but I never got to see like my,

2220
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:06,050
I got to see a few of my real influences
live.

2221
01:28:06,051 --> 01:28:07,190
I saw Hicks live.

2222
01:28:07,610 --> 01:28:10,150
I saw him live like four or five times.
How was that?

2223
01:28:10,190 --> 01:28:15,190
It was pretty wild.
I saw him live and no one knew who he 

2224
01:28:15,190 --> 01:28:15,980
was and here's an interesting thing for 
comedy historians.

2225
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:18,560
When Hicks,
when I first saw him,

2226
01:28:18,980 --> 01:28:23,980
he was very similar to Sam Kennison to 
the point where it was like he was 

2227
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:26,390
stealing his essence.
I would say right now,

2228
01:28:26,391 --> 01:28:28,180
like,
you know the thing,

2229
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:30,970
but it's a good.
That's a good way of describing it.

2230
01:28:30,971 --> 01:28:32,000
Right.
When I first saw him,

2231
01:28:32,150 --> 01:28:36,840
he was making kinison like noises and 
doing like sounds like in between bits,

2232
01:28:36,841 --> 01:28:38,400
like the bit didn't go so well and you 
do those,

2233
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:39,710
this Kennison like thing.
I was like,

2234
01:28:39,711 --> 01:28:44,711
wow,
this guy was like connected to kinisons 

2235
01:28:44,711 --> 01:28:47,231
like thing and it makes sense because he
was like one of the guys that opened 

2236
01:28:47,231 --> 01:28:47,330
with kinison and followed them around on
the road,

2237
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,160
but he got out of that quickly.

2238
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:53,570
We all are influenced by other guys.
I know you had an Anthony Clark period.

2239
01:28:53,571 --> 01:28:57,650
I had a Richard Jeni period where I 
stopped myself on stage and I realized I

2240
01:28:57,651 --> 01:29:02,651
sounded like my cadence and everything 
was Richard Jennings who was a big 

2241
01:29:02,651 --> 01:29:03,720
Richard Jeni fan,
but I was like,

2242
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:08,780
I gotta stop my salary,
but I did a lot of people don't know 

2243
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:09,390
that hix had that with Kennison,
no evergreen,

2244
01:29:09,470 --> 01:29:11,760
but he thinks it's Hicks especially 
because his dad have this,

2245
01:29:11,761 --> 01:29:16,761
you know,
this God who is an amazing comedian and 

2246
01:29:16,761 --> 01:29:16,761
very influential,
very unique and,

2247
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:21,770
but all of us have this weird thing 
where we want to be like someone we 

2248
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:23,790
admire and sometimes it sounds like it 
onstage,

2249
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:29,420
but he stopped that after awhile.
I saw him once and he had it like that 

2250
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:30,230
and then I saw him again,
you know,

2251
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:33,000
just like six months later.
And he didn't do any of that.

2252
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:35,070
In the end,
he had a bunch of new shit.

2253
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:40,340
I saw him do it headliners set at the 
comedy connection and then a headliner 

2254
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:43,850
set literally like six months later and 
there's a totally new hour and almost 

2255
01:29:43,850 --> 01:29:43,850
like

2256
01:29:43,850 --> 01:29:43,880
he just,
he figured it out.

2257
01:29:43,881 --> 01:29:48,881
Right?
There's that moment we all have where 

2258
01:29:48,881 --> 01:29:48,881
it's like you just something clicks and 
you finally realize,

2259
01:29:48,881 --> 01:29:49,700
all right,
this is what I need to do,

2260
01:29:49,701 --> 01:29:52,310
or this is my voice or my truth,
or whatever the fuck.

2261
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:55,740
When you think about it,
for a guy who's only human,

2262
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:57,830
I believe when he died he was only 32 
years old.

2263
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:03,160
His ideas and philosophies and the 
validity of his opinions were so 

2264
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:04,150
advanced,
you know,

2265
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:09,190
for,
for a person of that age because really 

2266
01:30:09,190 --> 01:30:11,471
like most 25 year old guys,
he was 25 when he's doing a lot of his 

2267
01:30:11,471 --> 01:30:11,471
act,
right?

2268
01:30:11,471 --> 01:30:15,070
Most 25 year old guys.
You better shut the fuck up if you want 

2269
01:30:15,070 --> 01:30:16,280
to tell me how the world's running to 
stop just you don't know and don't.

2270
01:30:16,281 --> 01:30:20,730
Don't give me any nobody fucking nine 
slash 11 conspiracy website bullshit and

2271
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:21,500
you're fucking.
What are you?

2272
01:30:21,501 --> 01:30:23,570
Twenty four dude?
Really just don't,

2273
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,030
don't,
don't tell me how to run the world.

2274
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:28,550
Let's grow a little.
Let's get some life experience.

2275
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:33,700
Then give,
give it to me from the perspective of 

2276
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:35,330
someone who's actually seen something,
but he was advanced to like 25,

2277
01:30:35,331 --> 01:30:40,331
26,
27 really relevant points and really 

2278
01:30:40,331 --> 01:30:40,970
good material there.
No bad period.

2279
01:30:41,170 --> 01:30:43,090
And if you look at as material,
you know,

2280
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:45,350
like there was no period where it was 
bad.

2281
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:46,880
It got better and better and better.

2282
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:51,980
I think one thing that he,
he really latched onto and maybe it was 

2283
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:53,670
after going through the,
the chemists and influence was like,

2284
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:58,910
and I appreciate it was like this 
release of whatever emotion it seemed 

2285
01:30:59,431 --> 01:31:04,431
was going through him.
He just allowed it to come out even if 

2286
01:31:04,431 --> 01:31:06,630
it was mid other story or idea and I 
would just watch that.

2287
01:31:06,631 --> 01:31:08,880
And I,
I remember thinking that was empowering.

2288
01:31:09,390 --> 01:31:10,050
I was like,
wow,

2289
01:31:10,051 --> 01:31:13,260
this is a place where you can go up and 
you can fucking ring shit out.

2290
01:31:13,590 --> 01:31:14,540
And people,
you know,

2291
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:16,200
with a joke,
I think it's like a good song.

2292
01:31:16,201 --> 01:31:18,150
Sometimes you don't know the lyrics to a
song,

2293
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:20,310
you just love the fucking song.
You realize years later,

2294
01:31:20,311 --> 01:31:25,311
like,
I don't even know what they're saying 

2295
01:31:25,311 --> 01:31:26,361
here,
but it doesn't matter and I think with 

2296
01:31:26,361 --> 01:31:28,680
some comedians it's like it's not even 
so much about what they're saying is how

2297
01:31:28,681 --> 01:31:31,830
they're expressing something emotionally
behind that.

2298
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:33,130
Those are the guys that I always 
watched.

2299
01:31:33,131 --> 01:31:33,920
I mean,
Carlin,

2300
01:31:33,930 --> 01:31:37,740
of course prior it was like,
there was truth mixed with just humor,

2301
01:31:37,741 --> 01:31:39,690
just random ideas.

2302
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:40,950
No.
When I got to see two,

2303
01:31:40,951 --> 01:31:45,951
I got to see kinison become not so good.
Anything kinison who was my.

2304
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:49,200
The guy.
Remember I told you that chick,

2305
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:50,490
you know,
doing that thing in the parking lot.

2306
01:31:50,610 --> 01:31:52,660
That's what got me into comedy.
I mean literally that's.

2307
01:31:52,661 --> 01:31:54,600
That was the bug.
Planted it.

2308
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:59,960
I got to see him perform live after he 
had gotten really famous and really 

2309
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:03,651
successful and he would come on stage 
with the two girls and the whole thing 

2310
01:32:03,651 --> 01:32:03,651
and it was like I didn't laugh.
Yeah.

2311
01:32:03,651 --> 01:32:04,810
He stopped being funny.
He became like,

2312
01:32:04,811 --> 01:32:08,410
this caricature of this guy you listen 
to louder than hell.

2313
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:13,440
His first CD or whatever it was who 
listened to that still today and it's 

2314
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:13,450
brilliant.
It's really good.

2315
01:32:14,290 --> 01:32:15,940
But if you go and,
you know,

2316
01:32:15,941 --> 01:32:18,490
you look at the stuff that he did like 
right before he died,

2317
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:19,560
it's not good at all.

2318
01:32:19,630 --> 01:32:24,630
Yeah.
Well he got caught up in that MTV wild 

2319
01:32:24,630 --> 01:32:24,630
then.
Yeah,

2320
01:32:24,630 --> 01:32:28,230
you're right.
It was like the trench coat became an 

2321
01:32:28,230 --> 01:32:28,230
out,
like almost like a costume.

2322
01:32:28,230 --> 01:32:28,330
Yeah.
Yeah.

2323
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:33,680
Well dice for awhile kind of had the 
same thing going on too where he became 

2324
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:33,680
the dice man.
You know,

2325
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:36,080
the dice man was a character that he 
used to do on stage.

2326
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:41,120
Right.
And you should do these John Travolta 

2327
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:41,120
impression.

2328
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:41,120
Yes.
I'm young comedians.

2329
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:42,130
That's what I really liked him.
Thought he was really strong.

2330
01:32:42,330 --> 01:32:44,760
It was fucking brilliant and likable.
Charismatic.

2331
01:32:44,790 --> 01:32:47,010
Yeah.
I mean when dice burst onto the scene,

2332
01:32:47,011 --> 01:32:52,011
I mean I think I was right out of high 
school and I remember thinking that was 

2333
01:32:52,011 --> 01:32:52,800
the funniest shit I've ever heard in my 
life,

2334
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:57,990
you know?
And then hanging out with that guy at 

2335
01:32:57,990 --> 01:32:57,990
the comedy store years and years later 
and just like,

2336
01:32:57,990 --> 01:32:58,620
he's like a normal guy,
you know,

2337
01:32:58,650 --> 01:33:03,000
but now he is the iceman full time.
It was a character and now he's got this

2338
01:33:03,001 --> 01:33:05,190
leather jacket on and the gloves on full
time.

2339
01:33:05,191 --> 01:33:05,460
Now

2340
01:33:05,710 --> 01:33:07,720
I have a theory that it's like when 
you're,

2341
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:09,340
when you're a character,
not just a character,

2342
01:33:09,341 --> 01:33:12,670
but like look at any sitcoms or any 
fucking throat history.

2343
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:16,150
If you play a character,
especially with a weird name,

2344
01:33:16,530 --> 01:33:18,340
like if you're looking to poughkeepsie 
or lundy,

2345
01:33:18,670 --> 01:33:20,080
right?
You like you,

2346
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:21,700
but then you become,
okay,

2347
01:33:21,701 --> 01:33:26,701
I need to keep that hairdo.
I need to be recognized that era and you

2348
01:33:26,771 --> 01:33:28,520
play into it and I.
that's,

2349
01:33:28,650 --> 01:33:33,650
that's frustrating when you see that,
but it's why I never wanted to be a 

2350
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:33,650
character man.
I was like,

2351
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:36,940
I'd rather change and not be as funny,
but still have certain fans and I've had

2352
01:33:36,941 --> 01:33:41,941
this happen.
I've had fans go through to like your 

2353
01:33:41,941 --> 01:33:41,941
stuff back when I first I know,
but I was a kid.

2354
01:33:41,941 --> 01:33:42,790
I was talking about kids.
Shit I didn't.

2355
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:45,370
I was still new.
It's like if I didn't change,

2356
01:33:45,371 --> 01:33:48,190
you would not fucking hang out and care 
at all.

2357
01:33:48,220 --> 01:33:49,630
What I was doing.
Well,

2358
01:33:49,631 --> 01:33:51,220
there's people that are going to like 
you at one stage.

2359
01:33:51,221 --> 01:33:53,890
You career not in another and that's 
okay because that's where they are.

2360
01:33:53,891 --> 01:33:56,200
They are where you were at that stage of
your career.

2361
01:33:56,201 --> 01:33:57,420
Exactly.
You know,

2362
01:33:57,550 --> 01:33:58,510
whatever.
Sorry,

2363
01:33:58,600 --> 01:33:59,800
I love that.
I lost Ya.

2364
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:01,660
I got some new people on the way.
I lost a few.

2365
01:34:01,661 --> 01:34:04,810
I got a few stragglers that that becomes
what you crave.

2366
01:34:04,870 --> 01:34:08,110
I really believe because at first you 
just want to get to keep my fans.

2367
01:34:08,111 --> 01:34:13,111
I gotta I gotTa hold order.
I'm going to make them happy and when 

2368
01:34:13,111 --> 01:34:14,110
you let go of that and you realize 
somebody's going to check out for awhile

2369
01:34:14,170 --> 01:34:16,090
and then I had a guy write me an email 
and he goes,

2370
01:34:16,091 --> 01:34:16,540
dude,
listen,

2371
01:34:16,590 --> 01:34:19,390
I,
I jumped on the hate train or whatever.

2372
01:34:19,391 --> 01:34:20,550
I didn't like you.
I listened.

2373
01:34:20,570 --> 01:34:21,400
Isolated,
incident,

2374
01:34:21,401 --> 01:34:26,401
hurt.
You're talking about your folks talking 

2375
01:34:26,401 --> 01:34:26,401
about shit that I've experienced.
I'm back in Madame,

2376
01:34:26,401 --> 01:34:27,270
hanging out.
I've been trained,

2377
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:34,570
but that's cool man.
That's like people that can check in and

2378
01:34:34,571 --> 01:34:35,710
out.
Like I respect that.

2379
01:34:35,711 --> 01:34:37,000
You know,
I do the same thing with music.

2380
01:34:37,001 --> 01:34:38,830
I don't always like what somebody 
putting out,

2381
01:34:38,831 --> 01:34:42,130
but of course like perfect example that 
exactly.

2382
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:43,000
Doing sound garden

2383
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,080
and then he was doing dog shit and now 
he's doing soundgarden.

2384
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:45,800
Right.
It's all right.

2385
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:47,060
Awesome.
I'm still here.

2386
01:34:47,170 --> 01:34:47,790
All right.
I just,

2387
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:50,060
I bought that other stuff.
I just wasn't into it.

2388
01:34:50,090 --> 01:34:51,160
Yeah.
But you know,

2389
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:56,260
go ahead and take your chances.
Who the fuck knows what makes the 

2390
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:56,260
connection?
You know,

2391
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:58,070
if you don't take that chance of you.
As soon as you start about like,

2392
01:34:58,071 --> 01:34:59,750
wow,
I have to do what they want,

2393
01:34:59,751 --> 01:35:01,610
then you're fucked because then you 
don't even know what you're doing.

2394
01:35:01,910 --> 01:35:04,370
It has to be what you,
what's inside of you.

2395
01:35:04,390 --> 01:35:05,490
But that's how many guys do

2396
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:06,930
you guys see this?
It's like,

2397
01:35:07,230 --> 01:35:12,230
that's why when people,
new comics come to you out here and 

2398
01:35:12,230 --> 01:35:12,230
they're like,
what do I need to do?

2399
01:35:12,230 --> 01:35:12,330
I'm like,
get the fuck Outta here.

2400
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:16,710
Who didn't come up here?
Because you're going to be like packaged

2401
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:19,830
in immediately.
Like there's a stigma on you leave.

2402
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:22,710
Well there were so many guys at the 
laugh factory that became you,

2403
01:35:23,020 --> 01:35:25,170
um,
when you became famous.

2404
01:35:25,870 --> 01:35:29,370
But when it was starting to happen,
even when you were like packing Dublin's

2405
01:35:29,371 --> 01:35:30,570
all the time,
there was,

2406
01:35:30,571 --> 01:35:33,840
I noticed so many guys that were doing 
you onstage.

2407
01:35:33,870 --> 01:35:34,500
I was like,
wow,

2408
01:35:34,501 --> 01:35:36,450
this is fucking crazy.
It's like,

2409
01:35:36,451 --> 01:35:41,451
here's these guys that have noticed 
something that's working and they're 

2410
01:35:41,451 --> 01:35:41,970
just jumping on it.
That's a fascinating thing to see.

2411
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:43,830
You know,
like a whole new wave.

2412
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:48,880
You know,
that there's a wave of guys that came 

2413
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,931
out of the laugh factory.
Jo Koy that sounds just like you and 

2414
01:35:50,931 --> 01:35:52,490
Mitch Hedberg stand hopes there's all 
these sorts of clothes.

2415
01:35:52,510 --> 01:35:53,210
Yeah,
yeah.

2416
01:35:53,220 --> 01:35:54,710
Well a lot of Mitch Hedberg guys,
right?

2417
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:58,050
There's a lot of guys that all bad guys 
that were like pretty good,

2418
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:59,250
good comments.
But they were like,

2419
01:35:59,251 --> 01:36:00,840
dude,
you got to stop doing that.

2420
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,100
Yeah,
I know you're good.

2421
01:36:02,101 --> 01:36:05,010
You have some good jokes,
but stop.

2422
01:36:06,390 --> 01:36:08,040
It's like,
yeah,

2423
01:36:08,990 --> 01:36:11,340
right.
It's like doing Mitch Hedberg.

2424
01:36:11,790 --> 01:36:13,110
I'll tell you man.
It was good.

2425
01:36:13,270 --> 01:36:15,270
It was fascinating to.
Okay,

2426
01:36:15,290 --> 01:36:16,420
what had happened.
And it was like,

2427
01:36:16,421 --> 01:36:16,740
fuck,
I'm,

2428
01:36:16,770 --> 01:36:17,030
I'm,
I'm,

2429
01:36:17,230 --> 01:36:19,120
I'm famous.
I'm known.

2430
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:22,600
People are talking about me when I'm not
trying to fucking get something going.

2431
01:36:22,601 --> 01:36:24,520
And the is like,
that was really,

2432
01:36:24,521 --> 01:36:27,760
they were setting this tempo and then 
there were guys that you see come out.

2433
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:30,040
It's a little flattering and weird when 
you're like,

2434
01:36:30,070 --> 01:36:31,210
oh,
this guy is kind of like me,

2435
01:36:31,211 --> 01:36:33,490
and it makes you not want to watch 
comedy because you're,

2436
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:38,520
you're a little freaked out by it.
But then you know that over a couple of 

2437
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:40,150
years down the line as guys start 
getting frustrated,

2438
01:36:40,151 --> 01:36:42,850
those same guys were the ones who would 
come out of the woodwork and say,

2439
01:36:43,180 --> 01:36:46,510
oh no Dane fucking took from me.
I was doing that shit.

2440
01:36:46,690 --> 01:36:48,310
That is true.
That will happen.

2441
01:36:48,311 --> 01:36:50,740
And guys will forget that they stole it 
from you.

2442
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:53,470
That does happen.
They'll forget that they got the idea to

2443
01:36:53,471 --> 01:36:56,590
behave that way from you.
And they'll decide in their head somehow

2444
01:36:56,591 --> 01:36:58,750
that they were doing at first.
But you guys would do that.

2445
01:36:58,810 --> 01:36:59,650
But you know,
it's like,

2446
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:01,380
like you just nailed it.
It's like you,

2447
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:01,980
you,
you,

2448
01:37:01,981 --> 01:37:03,670
you take that,
you have a voice,

2449
01:37:03,671 --> 01:37:08,671
you have certain people that you want to
emulate and then you figure out your 

2450
01:37:08,671 --> 01:37:11,701
shit and you grow out of it.
And I'm as kind of understanding and 

2451
01:37:11,701 --> 01:37:11,701
cool about that because I've been up,
down,

2452
01:37:11,701 --> 01:37:12,070
up,
down,

2453
01:37:12,071 --> 01:37:12,640
and it's like,

2454
01:37:13,230 --> 01:37:18,230
but in the beginning though,
you don't feel that way in the 

2455
01:37:18,230 --> 01:37:20,901
beginning.
You feel like someone's stealing from 

2456
01:37:20,901 --> 01:37:21,010
you and put a stop to it because when 
you're not famous and you're,

2457
01:37:21,011 --> 01:37:23,330
you're struggling and you're coming up 
and you know,

2458
01:37:23,331 --> 01:37:28,331
and you just starting to do well and 
then you see somebody start ganking off 

2459
01:37:28,331 --> 01:37:28,331
you and you're like,
hey,

2460
01:37:28,331 --> 01:37:28,331
hey,
hey,

2461
01:37:28,331 --> 01:37:32,570
I created all this excess of the at a 
hard work and you're just kind of like 

2462
01:37:32,570 --> 01:37:32,570
emulating it.
Stopped doing that.

2463
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:34,290
Like you're,
you're doing what you saw,

2464
01:37:34,291 --> 01:37:36,840
be successful.
You're doing a version of me.

2465
01:37:36,910 --> 01:37:37,800
Right.
That's tricky,

2466
01:37:37,801 --> 01:37:38,880
man.
That's a tricky thing.

2467
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:41,220
It's a tricky thing because it just 
feels like someone.

2468
01:37:41,221 --> 01:37:42,930
I mean it really.
You got to let them do it.

2469
01:37:42,931 --> 01:37:44,340
You know what I mean?
Look,

2470
01:37:44,370 --> 01:37:46,710
if you become successful just through 
the merit of your own work,

2471
01:37:46,711 --> 01:37:49,050
it's going to be really clear who's 
copying and who's,

2472
01:37:49,051 --> 01:37:50,610
you know,
who's imitating who,

2473
01:37:50,970 --> 01:37:52,710
but it just doesn't feel like that in 
the beginning,

2474
01:37:52,711 --> 01:37:54,930
in the beginning when you don't have 
money and you're not like,

2475
01:37:54,931 --> 01:37:56,460
if someone's doing me now,
I'm like,

2476
01:37:56,490 --> 01:37:57,780
you have this guy,
why are you doing that?

2477
01:37:57,780 --> 01:37:58,200
Like,
wow,

2478
01:37:58,201 --> 01:37:59,500
I guess that's what happens,
you know,

2479
01:38:00,450 --> 01:38:02,930
and flatter even though it's still,
you know,

2480
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,700
but you figured they would be done with 
it.

2481
01:38:04,701 --> 01:38:06,900
I mean,
I was doing it when I was an open Miker,

2482
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:11,920
you know,
I was doing it like it was a year in or 

2483
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:11,920
two years in,
you know,

2484
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:11,920
I would hear myself sound like somebody 
else,

2485
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:14,250
but when someone's doing it and that's 
their act on comedy central,

2486
01:38:14,251 --> 01:38:15,000
you're like,
okay man,

2487
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:18,330
you took this too far.
You have to do your own thing.

2488
01:38:18,331 --> 01:38:19,800
You have to have your own delivery.

2489
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:20,940
Yes.
And you know what,

2490
01:38:20,970 --> 01:38:25,970
it's funny because the first time in my 
life I ever ran into was with you when 

2491
01:38:25,981 --> 01:38:26,510
we had,
you know,

2492
01:38:26,610 --> 01:38:31,610
it was like 1998 and Joe called me up.
I remember I was still living in that 

2493
01:38:31,610 --> 01:38:31,610
shitty apartment and you're like,
dude,

2494
01:38:31,610 --> 01:38:32,790
there's a fucking bit that you're doing.
And it's,

2495
01:38:33,210 --> 01:38:36,930
it's like my closing bit.
I remember I was so fucked up by that.

2496
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:38,610
Not only because it was like,
you know,

2497
01:38:38,611 --> 01:38:40,530
I had a lot of respect for Joe,
but it was like,

2498
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:43,650
I don't ever want to be one of those 
guys that gets,

2499
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:45,150
you know,
put in that position.

2500
01:38:45,210 --> 01:38:50,210
And I remember feeling like that was a 
defining moment for me because it was 

2501
01:38:50,210 --> 01:38:54,141
like I need to talk even more about 
maybe not nostalgic things or things 

2502
01:38:54,141 --> 01:38:57,891
that are outward that I see,
but things that are from me that 

2503
01:38:57,891 --> 01:38:57,891
happened to me.

2504
01:38:58,270 --> 01:39:03,270
It's hard though because especially if 
you're influenced by someone else and 

2505
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:03,850
you are,
you're a bit is influenced by their bed.

2506
01:39:03,851 --> 01:39:05,290
And even though you know it is,
you know,

2507
01:39:05,291 --> 01:39:10,291
you shouldn't probably do it because 
everyone thinks that you kind of stole 

2508
01:39:10,291 --> 01:39:10,900
it,
but it kills and that's the problem,

2509
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:14,530
fucking crushed all you have at that.
And it's such a life pit.

2510
01:39:14,531 --> 01:39:15,360
It's just,
you know,

2511
01:39:15,380 --> 01:39:18,370
you could go up there with this one and 
just fucking slam it in.

2512
01:39:18,790 --> 01:39:23,790
But really ethically it's almost like 
you have to find out what's good about 

2513
01:39:23,790 --> 01:39:25,060
that and cut it out and try to add it to
something that you create,

2514
01:39:25,510 --> 01:39:25,960
you know,
you,

2515
01:39:25,961 --> 01:39:28,360
you can be influenced by something and 
you know,

2516
01:39:28,361 --> 01:39:30,790
and you're not even,
you're not even aware of it,

2517
01:39:30,820 --> 01:39:35,820
you know,
you never see what a lot of guys like 

2518
01:39:35,820 --> 01:39:38,550
work together.
Like we saw that at the comedy store a 

2519
01:39:38,550 --> 01:39:40,351
lot where like guys would work together 
and guys would riff in the back parking 

2520
01:39:40,351 --> 01:39:40,900
lot and then they would go on stage and 
it was like,

2521
01:39:40,930 --> 01:39:44,830
it was like a battle over whose bid as 
this who's been as this.

2522
01:39:44,830 --> 01:39:47,230
We're sitting out,
like Stan hope had this fucking guy that

2523
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:50,620
was opening for him.
This guy was a Douche and he,

2524
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:54,610
he would go onstage and they,
whenever they would would fucking riff,

2525
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:59,700
stand hope and say a bunch of cool shit 
and this guy would go on stage and do 

2526
01:39:59,700 --> 01:39:59,700
stand ups.
Cool Shit.

2527
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:00,670
It's just like,
fuck man.

2528
01:40:00,671 --> 01:40:05,671
Now I can't riff in front of you.
I can't just fuck around and come up 

2529
01:40:05,671 --> 01:40:05,740
with it.
But then when you're still too are doing

2530
01:40:05,741 --> 01:40:07,750
it together and then you know,
you've got to figure out,

2531
01:40:07,751 --> 01:40:10,150
well who's is this?
What's going on here?

2532
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:12,020
You know?
Or somebody like you,

2533
01:40:12,030 --> 01:40:17,030
you'll have an idea and original premise
and someone will add a tag to it and 

2534
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:17,890
then take your whole fucking thing.
And they added a tag.

2535
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:18,660
Like,
no,

2536
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:20,650
that's fucking.
It just came up with that

2537
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:24,320
to this day like bobby and now because 
I've known I since I was a kid,

2538
01:40:24,350 --> 01:40:25,400
13 years old,
bobby,

2539
01:40:25,401 --> 01:40:29,300
since I started,
bobby get Robert Kelly and us three.

2540
01:40:29,301 --> 01:40:30,860
Definitely.
I can hear it all the time.

2541
01:40:30,890 --> 01:40:31,940
Bobby does certain things.
I'm like,

2542
01:40:31,970 --> 01:40:34,670
oh,
that sounds like me or all three of us.

2543
01:40:35,150 --> 01:40:37,520
Because we started,
we spent so much fucking time together.

2544
01:40:37,521 --> 01:40:38,850
We formed our,
you know,

2545
01:40:38,870 --> 01:40:40,100
kind of comic,
uh,

2546
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:45,160
cadences and all the tricks that you 
learned that those were the two guys 

2547
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:45,160
that I can still watch and be like,
oh,

2548
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:45,920
that's how we influenced each other.
Yeah.

2549
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:47,640
I have one friend when I come up with an
idea,

2550
01:40:47,641 --> 01:40:52,641
I have to walk away.
I walk away and I say it in my head and 

2551
01:40:52,641 --> 01:40:56,061
I write it down because I don't say it 
in front of them because if I say in 

2552
01:40:56,061 --> 01:40:58,621
front of them,
I'm pretty sure that it's eventually 

2553
01:40:58,621 --> 01:40:58,621
going to on stage,
so I have to go away.

2554
01:40:58,621 --> 01:41:00,280
Am I fucking really do that?
Yeah.

2555
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:04,420
Yeah.
But the worst is the one friend that you

2556
01:41:04,421 --> 01:41:09,421
have an idea and you start saying the 
idea and they try to top it and they 

2557
01:41:09,421 --> 01:41:09,421
start talking over you.

2558
01:41:09,421 --> 01:41:09,421
No,
no,

2559
01:41:09,421 --> 01:41:09,421
no,
no.

2560
01:41:09,421 --> 01:41:10,800
You don't delicate.
It's coming out of nowhere.

2561
01:41:10,801 --> 01:41:12,780
It's coming out of manage base.
Let me say it.

2562
01:41:13,380 --> 01:41:18,380
Could you fucking imagine if.
Imagine if Oprah decided that she was 

2563
01:41:18,380 --> 01:41:23,070
tying them on this book.
If you talk white now,

2564
01:41:23,071 --> 01:41:23,990
you're going to.
I'm going to miss.

2565
01:41:24,010 --> 01:41:25,920
I'm getting a gift right now from the 
universe.

2566
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:29,070
It's like ideas like crazy ideas 
sometimes will come to you,

2567
01:41:29,071 --> 01:41:34,071
like fully formed,
but if you start talking and explaining 

2568
01:41:34,071 --> 01:41:34,860
it to other people and then someone jams
in with their own shit,

2569
01:41:34,861 --> 01:41:35,400
it's like,
oh,

2570
01:41:35,401 --> 01:41:37,040
it's lost now.
Yes.

2571
01:41:37,170 --> 01:41:40,770
Or if they start trying to get to what 
your getting to because they kind of get

2572
01:41:40,771 --> 01:41:44,250
a sense of it wrong,
wrong,

2573
01:41:44,550 --> 01:41:45,000
and you're like,
no,

2574
01:41:45,001 --> 01:41:46,590
that's not what I'm saying at all.
And then like,

2575
01:41:46,591 --> 01:41:49,260
fuck,
just lost all my momentum communications

2576
01:41:49,261 --> 01:41:50,830
data.
That's why we should all text each other

2577
01:41:50,831 --> 01:41:53,250
because that's just the whole time for 
that.

2578
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:58,900
Brian,
you're in your mind is your name from 

2579
01:41:58,900 --> 01:41:59,120
now on the Internet is going to call you
Chris,

2580
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:00,840
Chris,
Chris,

2581
01:42:01,090 --> 01:42:01,740
he,
Brian,

2582
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:03,840
Brian.
At the end of the beginning of the show,

2583
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:05,670
Dan showed up and Dan goes,
hey,

2584
01:42:05,671 --> 01:42:08,110
Chris.
And Brian was like,

2585
01:42:10,580 --> 01:42:12,780
I could call him Chris for like months 
set

2586
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:17,900
and I told them,
when you meet as many people as certain 

2587
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:17,900
people do,
literally you lose your,

2588
01:42:17,910 --> 01:42:22,910
your space in your memory bank for 
people's lives because I don't see you 

2589
01:42:22,910 --> 01:42:26,271
for a month.
You're fucking shit is gone from my 

2590
01:42:26,271 --> 01:42:26,271
brain.
I know there you're that guy.

2591
01:42:26,271 --> 01:42:26,820
We could have hung out,
smoked a joint,

2592
01:42:26,821 --> 01:42:28,830
went to a movie.
I don't fucking remember you dude.

2593
01:42:28,831 --> 01:42:30,270
Right?
There's too many to remember.

2594
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:33,030
Everything you remember Joe,
we,

2595
01:42:33,031 --> 01:42:34,140
uh,
we met and we hung out.

2596
01:42:34,380 --> 01:42:37,430
It was the galaxy theater and we all 
stood on the curb like,

2597
01:42:37,450 --> 01:42:39,390
and you're like,
I don't fucking remember where this was.

2598
01:42:39,391 --> 01:42:44,391
I have a friend who's famous who likes 
to fuck a bunch of different girls and 

2599
01:42:44,391 --> 01:42:44,440
uh,
his whole,

2600
01:42:44,490 --> 01:42:49,490
I mean,
he's a complete pussy addict and he 

2601
01:42:49,490 --> 01:42:52,100
doesn't think it's a big deal in these 
girls aren't going to be attached to 

2602
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:52,100
them.

2603
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:52,100
I'm like,
do you not understand?

2604
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:52,860
I go,
you are,

2605
01:42:52,890 --> 01:42:57,000
you're in movies and people love you and
they see you all the time and they,

2606
01:42:57,330 --> 01:42:57,830
they,
they're,

2607
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:00,690
they're attracted to you.
And you're meeting all these people,

2608
01:43:00,691 --> 01:43:03,510
millions and millions of them,
and it's not a big deal to you,

2609
01:43:03,660 --> 01:43:07,170
but to them it's like,
oh my God,

2610
01:43:07,171 --> 01:43:11,490
this is a big fucking giant movie.
And his penis inside my vagina.

2611
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:15,270
It's like the greatest moment ever.
And you forgot her name already,

2612
01:43:15,330 --> 01:43:20,330
right?
It's literally one of the top three 

2613
01:43:20,330 --> 01:43:21,030
things that they'll ever fucking one or 
talk about what their close friends.

2614
01:43:21,100 --> 01:43:22,860
Yeah.
I tried to tell this dude the reason why

2615
01:43:22,861 --> 01:43:25,620
these girls go crazy is because they 
think you're in love with them.

2616
01:43:25,621 --> 01:43:26,220
They think,
you know,

2617
01:43:26,221 --> 01:43:28,950
this is going to be like a love affair 
now and you're just moving onto the next

2618
01:43:28,951 --> 01:43:33,951
check and you know,
you got to be careful that your single 

2619
01:43:34,690 --> 01:43:39,690
girlfriend.
So I was with a trick for about five 

2620
01:43:39,690 --> 01:43:40,020
years and about eight months ago.
So she was,

2621
01:43:40,140 --> 01:43:42,570
she was there for the big ride for most 
of it.

2622
01:43:42,571 --> 01:43:43,110
Yeah.
Wow.

2623
01:43:44,490 --> 01:43:49,110
What would finally just drove the nail 
everything a lot,

2624
01:43:49,111 --> 01:43:49,630
man.
Yeah.

2625
01:43:49,700 --> 01:43:51,030
Is she in the business?
In order was.

2626
01:43:51,410 --> 01:43:52,040
Yes,
but

2627
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:57,040
I,
I went through a lot of Shit my folks 

2628
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:59,141
and then into my brother is four or five
years ever made surprised you're even 

2629
01:43:59,141 --> 01:44:00,160
functioning,
you know,

2630
01:44:00,170 --> 01:44:02,630
because sometimes I am too men because 
it really was a,

2631
01:44:03,140 --> 01:44:05,580
you know,
I lived to perform because I,

2632
01:44:05,780 --> 01:44:09,460
my folks were just the coolest fucking 
people and uh,

2633
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:11,750
they got but they got to see everything.
That's what I've come to the,

2634
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:17,250
you know,
at the end of all the talking about it 

2635
01:44:17,250 --> 01:44:19,841
and figuring it out.
It's like they got to see everything on 

2636
01:44:19,841 --> 01:44:21,470
one.
Do you find it's hard to date chicks in 

2637
01:44:21,470 --> 01:44:23,591
the business right now I'm just having 
fun so I'm just Kinda like doing 

2638
01:44:23,591 --> 01:44:25,070
whatever.
But I would not want to settle down with

2639
01:44:25,071 --> 01:44:25,460
a headshot.

2640
01:44:25,870 --> 01:44:30,870
That's it.
That's why I haven't no head shots 

2641
01:44:30,870 --> 01:44:30,870
possible.
Yeah.

2642
01:44:30,870 --> 01:44:30,870
Yeah.
Year seven year period.

2643
01:44:30,870 --> 01:44:35,420
It was after seven years.
You haven't had a headshot in seven 

2644
01:44:35,420 --> 01:44:35,420
years.
Okay.

2645
01:44:35,420 --> 01:44:35,420
You're good.
You're clear,

2646
01:44:35,420 --> 01:44:36,340
you're clear.
You're,

2647
01:44:36,430 --> 01:44:37,870
you've escaped the spell,
you know,

2648
01:44:37,871 --> 01:44:38,650
but there's,
you know,

2649
01:44:38,651 --> 01:44:40,840
real housewives of Calabasas,
all these crazy bitches.

2650
01:44:41,140 --> 01:44:42,610
They all wanted to be actresses.
Yeah,

2651
01:44:42,611 --> 01:44:43,200
man,
it's,

2652
01:44:43,340 --> 01:44:44,350
no,
I'm fucked up.

2653
01:44:44,380 --> 01:44:46,450
Okay.
But I've figured out how to deal with my

2654
01:44:46,451 --> 01:44:48,460
fucked up and make it work and be a,
you know,

2655
01:44:48,470 --> 01:44:53,470
a fairly healthy human being.
But I know that other people that are 

2656
01:44:53,470 --> 01:44:54,010
fucked up,
like the odds are we're going to be able

2657
01:44:54,011 --> 01:44:56,650
to talk and hang out and be cool with 
each other and make this work out and be

2658
01:44:56,651 --> 01:44:57,550
both.
Be Balanced.

2659
01:44:57,551 --> 01:44:59,880
It's very hard.
The odds are very,

2660
01:44:59,881 --> 01:45:04,881
very small that you're going to have 
your shit together and we're going to 

2661
01:45:04,881 --> 01:45:04,881
have a healthy relationship.

2662
01:45:04,881 --> 01:45:08,960
You know,
it's just like too many times over and 

2663
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:10,861
over and again you just deal with all 
these crazy people and all this 

2664
01:45:10,861 --> 01:45:15,030
psychosis involved in the auditioning 
process breaks people's souls because 

2665
01:45:15,030 --> 01:45:19,980
this getting this movie or getting this 
television show or anything they're 

2666
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:22,680
auditioning for,
it could be the biggest fucking moment 

2667
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:24,961
in their life and they're freaking out 
and they're pacing around the waiting 

2668
01:45:24,961 --> 01:45:25,020
room and you get to see them go over 
their lines like it's.

2669
01:45:25,150 --> 01:45:26,040
It makes.
I went for.

2670
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:30,550
I read for us at comic six months ago.
I got nervous being in the room with all

2671
01:45:30,551 --> 01:45:32,350
these people that were nervous.
I was like,

2672
01:45:32,351 --> 01:45:35,710
I just want to get the fuck outta here.
Like this is a terrible feeling.

2673
01:45:35,890 --> 01:45:37,060
You know,
I've got money.

2674
01:45:37,061 --> 01:45:38,280
I don't have to worry about shit.
This.

2675
01:45:38,281 --> 01:45:43,281
It just seems like it'd be a fun job.
I'm looking at all these people like 

2676
01:45:43,281 --> 01:45:46,530
this is like a big fucking thing to big 
break and doing that every day over and 

2677
01:45:46,530 --> 01:45:46,990
over again,
getting rejected,

2678
01:45:46,991 --> 01:45:48,700
getting rejected,
needing that love,

2679
01:45:48,701 --> 01:45:50,260
getting rejected,
needing that love,

2680
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:51,070
getting rejected.

2681
01:45:51,160 --> 01:45:52,300
So close,
but nope.

2682
01:45:52,450 --> 01:45:53,560
Final three.
No,

2683
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:54,400
no,
no.

2684
01:45:54,401 --> 01:45:57,630
And they're doing this for years and 
years and this is already a person who's

2685
01:45:57,640 --> 01:46:00,010
psychologically unbalanced already a 
person who.

2686
01:46:00,130 --> 01:46:05,130
The reason why they want to be a 
performer in the first place is they 

2687
01:46:05,130 --> 01:46:06,130
want to be loved because they weren't 
loved as a child.

2688
01:46:06,430 --> 01:46:09,750
So there's this incredible horrible 
imbalance and they just can't,

2689
01:46:10,020 --> 01:46:15,020
can't quite connect.
And then you start dating them and it's 

2690
01:46:15,020 --> 01:46:15,020
like,
look man,

2691
01:46:15,020 --> 01:46:17,080
you're not on a.
A comfortable road like this isn't going

2692
01:46:17,081 --> 01:46:19,420
to be smooth and relaxed and everyone's 
carefree.

2693
01:46:19,540 --> 01:46:22,270
This is going to be constant psychosis.
Do you think I'm good?

2694
01:46:22,271 --> 01:46:23,650
Do you think I'm fat?
Is this good?

2695
01:46:23,651 --> 01:46:24,910
Is What?
Am I a loser?

2696
01:46:25,030 --> 01:46:28,840
We read lines with me falling like that 
though,

2697
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:31,810
but I'm not dating our friends.
Yeah,

2698
01:46:31,811 --> 01:46:36,811
but they should still have that same 
kind of fucking doing that five times a 

2699
01:46:36,811 --> 01:46:37,420
day every day.

2700
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:40,780
But they have success as comics.
That's the difference.

2701
01:46:40,810 --> 01:46:43,570
Guys like Joey and red either going to 
auditions all the time,

2702
01:46:43,780 --> 01:46:46,360
but they're also killing it on stage all
the time.

2703
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:49,260
They're also,
they're doing comedy all the time,

2704
01:46:49,290 --> 01:46:50,010
you know,
and Joe,

2705
01:46:50,011 --> 01:46:51,780
he's always getting acting gigs here and
there.

2706
01:46:51,781 --> 01:46:54,000
So it's like that in.
He's always getting,

2707
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:55,770
you know,
car commercials here and there,

2708
01:46:56,560 --> 01:47:01,560
doing well.
It's the people that are not making the 

2709
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:01,560
connection and you know,
girls too,

2710
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:02,550
you know,
if you're a girl,

2711
01:47:02,551 --> 01:47:07,551
man,
it's a natural feeling I think for a 

2712
01:47:07,551 --> 01:47:09,210
girl to want some sort of male 
companionship and protection for a woman

2713
01:47:09,211 --> 01:47:11,250
to be by herself.
Comes here from Omaha,

2714
01:47:11,251 --> 01:47:14,020
Nebraska or something.
She's going to be incredibly insecure.

2715
01:47:14,021 --> 01:47:15,870
Look at Cork in the middle of the ocean 
by herself.

2716
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:18,000
Anyway.
It doesn't have any friends committed to

2717
01:47:18,001 --> 01:47:20,010
this acting thing and then just 
rejection,

2718
01:47:20,011 --> 01:47:21,180
rejection,
rejection,

2719
01:47:21,450 --> 01:47:26,450
and then their whole childhood thing 
that dragged them there in the first 

2720
01:47:26,450 --> 01:47:26,450
place.
Then you come along and your cage.

2721
01:47:26,450 --> 01:47:28,230
Let's go see a movie like you don't even
know what the fuck you're getting into.

2722
01:47:28,630 --> 01:47:29,350
Just opening up to him

2723
01:47:29,370 --> 01:47:34,370
door to hell.
My ex was one of the classic cases of 

2724
01:47:34,370 --> 01:47:36,000
everything that I didn't know till after
the breakup.

2725
01:47:36,001 --> 01:47:41,001
Everything she always said she hated.
She came like literally every fucking 

2726
01:47:42,001 --> 01:47:42,620
facet.

2727
01:47:42,700 --> 01:47:44,140
That's why they hate.
They hate.

2728
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:46,810
They hate taxes.
What they're afraid of in themselves.

2729
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:47,340
Right?

2730
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:51,240
But it's tough because then people go,
you know what?

2731
01:47:51,470 --> 01:47:53,580
Like people that are further along in 
this industry,

2732
01:47:53,581 --> 01:47:54,090
what?
I'm always like,

2733
01:47:54,091 --> 01:47:55,420
what's your gym?
What can you,

2734
01:47:55,450 --> 01:47:56,250
you know,
what?

2735
01:47:56,260 --> 01:47:57,660
What can I learn from you?
And they go,

2736
01:47:58,100 --> 01:48:03,100
yeah,
you don't want to be with a girl who's 

2737
01:48:03,100 --> 01:48:03,100
in the industry,
but then you're like,

2738
01:48:03,100 --> 01:48:05,390
if somebody who isn't,
how do they really fucking understand 

2739
01:48:05,390 --> 01:48:05,400
the bullshit that I then have to deal 
with?

2740
01:48:05,401 --> 01:48:07,950
And so what's that middle ground?
Who is that girl in the middle?

2741
01:48:07,980 --> 01:48:08,880
Can find girls,

2742
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:11,420
I've met girls from the business that 
are really cool.

2743
01:48:11,421 --> 01:48:13,150
It's just really rare,
you know,

2744
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:14,350
there's a lot of them that are just 
right.

2745
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:17,250
No one just like acting.
I am Kinda dating a girl now,

2746
01:48:17,251 --> 01:48:22,251
but after what I've been through,
you kind of more trepidatious because 

2747
01:48:22,251 --> 01:48:22,251
you're like art,
if that's going to

2748
01:48:22,251 --> 01:48:23,960
throw that in there.
And trepidatious is a very rare word.

2749
01:48:24,170 --> 01:48:25,350
Thank you.
Know,

2750
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:26,970
strong,
strong move.

2751
01:48:27,550 --> 01:48:32,550
It's,
there's a lot of people that do things 

2752
01:48:32,550 --> 01:48:33,060
that you can't,
you can't find someone in the business,

2753
01:48:33,061 --> 01:48:35,220
but you can.
It's just rare.

2754
01:48:35,221 --> 01:48:36,450
You know,
you can't rule it out.

2755
01:48:36,451 --> 01:48:38,910
But as a rule,
if you're going to have an ethic,

2756
01:48:38,911 --> 01:48:42,650
it should be a no head shots policy.
Find some normal chick I haven't had and

2757
01:48:42,780 --> 01:48:44,160
buckshot policy.

2758
01:48:47,850 --> 01:48:49,710
I liked the way through the Gulf in the 
middle.

2759
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:55,400
That's Brian.
He's going to do something like that 

2760
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:55,400
just to make.
Oh Chris.

2761
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:58,100
Chris.
So,

2762
01:48:58,101 --> 01:48:59,400
um,
now that you've,

2763
01:48:59,510 --> 01:49:04,510
um,
you've done like how many specials for 

2764
01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:05,800
cds,
couples?

2765
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:10,920
Couple of specials when you do it now,
do you give yourself a specific amount 

2766
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:12,510
of time?
I do do a special and then say,

2767
01:49:12,511 --> 01:49:17,511
all right,
now I start fresh with all new material 

2768
01:49:17,511 --> 01:49:17,511
and within like x amount of months.
I do a new one.

2769
01:49:17,511 --> 01:49:18,860
This is probably the first time in 
awhile,

2770
01:49:18,930 --> 01:49:21,540
but I'm not putting a time limit on it.
I mean I used to,

2771
01:49:21,570 --> 01:49:22,180
it was like,
all right,

2772
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:27,440
every,
it was like every other year and then 

2773
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:27,440
you're preparing during that time.
Right now is like,

2774
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:32,240
I'm just,
I'm doing it for the first time at a 

2775
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:34,461
while.
Really just enjoying it is not a 

2776
01:49:34,461 --> 01:49:34,461
machine.
It's not like I got a fucking top.

2777
01:49:34,590 --> 01:49:37,320
As I got to make money,
it's like I'm okay now.

2778
01:49:37,380 --> 01:49:39,770
I'm in a good spot.
My fans are happy,

2779
01:49:40,580 --> 01:49:42,060
I'm happy,
I'm balanced,

2780
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:44,910
you know,
after some crazy years,

2781
01:49:45,430 --> 01:49:47,470
I'm just trying to enjoy fun.
I'm just trying enjoy it,

2782
01:49:47,471 --> 01:49:48,070
man.
Yeah.

2783
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:49,720
Yeah,
because that's the thing that you guys.

2784
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:51,840
It's like I had this moment.
I was like,

2785
01:49:51,850 --> 01:49:53,710
I had a good year when I hit where I'm 
like,

2786
01:49:54,070 --> 01:49:59,070
this is her dream come true time.
And I really did enjoy it and then it 

2787
01:49:59,070 --> 01:49:59,070
was like,
uh,

2788
01:49:59,070 --> 01:49:59,700
you know,
took care of my family and you know,

2789
01:49:59,710 --> 01:50:02,320
I had money and then a lot of stuff 
happened.

2790
01:50:02,510 --> 01:50:03,430
So I,
you know,

2791
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:06,020
a lot of stuff happened,
whether it was like internal from,

2792
01:50:06,021 --> 01:50:07,870
you know,
comedians or whether it was,

2793
01:50:07,871 --> 01:50:12,871
you know,
my folks being sick or all the shit dog 

2794
01:50:12,871 --> 01:50:16,380
shitting and getting evicted.
It was like I didn't have time to just 

2795
01:50:16,380 --> 01:50:18,670
be a regular person in process 
everything.

2796
01:50:18,970 --> 01:50:21,310
And so that's what I've really done the 
last couple years.

2797
01:50:21,420 --> 01:50:26,420
So go find it.
I find that it's drives me really crazy 

2798
01:50:26,420 --> 01:50:29,831
when I come up with a bit and then I put
it on a special and then right after I 

2799
01:50:29,831 --> 01:50:30,290
fucking film and I have a way better 
tagline,

2800
01:50:31,860 --> 01:50:34,070
then I'm like,
I'll let this go too quick.

2801
01:50:34,071 --> 01:50:37,390
I should have worked on this part of the
process of developing materials.

2802
01:50:37,420 --> 01:50:42,420
You got to do a bit over and over and 
over again until you find the rhythm of 

2803
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:42,420
it.
You find,

2804
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:46,420
you know,
the natural order of the words and you 

2805
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:46,420
know,
never done.

2806
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:46,850
It's never done,
man.

2807
01:50:46,970 --> 01:50:49,270
That's one of the great things about 
those guys in Boston,

2808
01:50:49,380 --> 01:50:54,380
the untold story of why they were so 
good as those guys had the same act 

2809
01:50:54,380 --> 01:50:58,031
forever.
A lot of those guys unfortunately kept 

2810
01:50:58,031 --> 01:50:59,300
the same act for years and years and 
years and people actually grew to expect

2811
01:50:59,301 --> 01:51:04,301
it.
They would go see Steve Sweeney who was 

2812
01:51:04,301 --> 01:51:04,301
fucking brilliant,
but it was the same.

2813
01:51:04,301 --> 01:51:04,301
Brilliant,
you know,

2814
01:51:04,301 --> 01:51:05,930
20 minutes that you had seen seven years
ago.

2815
01:51:05,931 --> 01:51:10,931
Right.
And they and they had it down and they 

2816
01:51:10,931 --> 01:51:13,721
had their act and it was a fucking 
machete and it would just slice through 

2817
01:51:13,721 --> 01:51:15,350
the crowd.
It was just all the timing terminators.

2818
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:18,200
Timing was just perfect,
you know,

2819
01:51:18,410 --> 01:51:23,410
the timing was just deadly.
There was so many of those guys then 

2820
01:51:23,410 --> 01:51:23,410
too.

2821
01:51:23,410 --> 01:51:23,410
Yeah,

2822
01:51:24,110 --> 01:51:26,270
yeah.
If you come out with a bit and you don't

2823
01:51:26,300 --> 01:51:28,510
really develop it enough,
it's like you don't.

2824
01:51:28,511 --> 01:51:31,490
Maybe you didn't quite get it out the 
perfect way.

2825
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:33,200
You know,
people love new shit.

2826
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:35,030
That's more important to them than 
anything,

2827
01:51:35,270 --> 01:51:36,680
but you want to like,
God,

2828
01:51:36,681 --> 01:51:39,430
you want to make sure it's done.
Want to make sure it's really good.

2829
01:51:39,660 --> 01:51:43,130
I kinda was like a few years back it 
fell into this routine of like,

2830
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:44,880
you know,
maybe it's never done in.

2831
01:51:44,881 --> 01:51:48,210
Maybe it's always kind of evolving in 
something else and that's okay.

2832
01:51:48,630 --> 01:51:53,630
Maybe it's just again,
more about who I am because I love guys 

2833
01:51:53,630 --> 01:51:56,811
like even Johnny Carson growing up,
I didn't know what the fuck jody was 

2834
01:51:56,811 --> 01:51:56,811
talking about half the time when I was a
kid,

2835
01:51:56,811 --> 01:51:58,320
but it was like this idea of,
Oh,

2836
01:51:58,400 --> 01:52:00,810
you're attracted to this,
this person,

2837
01:52:01,170 --> 01:52:05,760
and there's something glamorous about 
standup where you can't go anywhere else

2838
01:52:05,820 --> 01:52:10,820
except for maybe what we're doing here 
today without somebody impeding on it 

2839
01:52:10,820 --> 01:52:12,150
and like editing it or some standards 
and practice.

2840
01:52:12,180 --> 01:52:15,030
There's always somebody fucking with you
except comedies.

2841
01:52:15,031 --> 01:52:20,031
Glamorous.
Because you can say whatever it is you 

2842
01:52:20,031 --> 01:52:20,031
want to say.

2843
01:52:20,031 --> 01:52:20,031
And that's one of the things that I love
about this podcast too,

2844
01:52:20,031 --> 01:52:20,710
is this is,
this is.

2845
01:52:20,711 --> 01:52:24,950
So look how easy this.
We'll just have a couch and a Webcam and

2846
01:52:24,951 --> 01:52:26,830
a fucking table in a laptop.
It's,

2847
01:52:27,010 --> 01:52:28,360
that's it.
That's all good.

2848
01:52:28,420 --> 01:52:33,420
A flashlight that you can fuck a 
flashlight that you can fuck in some 

2849
01:52:33,420 --> 01:52:34,370
microphones and no one can tell you what
to do and luck,

2850
01:52:34,570 --> 01:52:35,170
you know,
look,

2851
01:52:35,171 --> 01:52:36,730
it's not polished.
It's not.

2852
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:38,380
We don't edit.
It was just fucking,

2853
01:52:38,381 --> 01:52:40,420
it's just a conversation.
It's a conversation every week.

2854
01:52:40,570 --> 01:52:41,920
You might like it,
we hope you do,

2855
01:52:42,220 --> 01:52:45,530
but no one's fucking with it.
And it becomes itself and you know,

2856
01:52:45,531 --> 01:52:47,300
other people digging their fingers in it
and

2857
01:52:47,660 --> 01:52:52,660
that I'll take this over any like any 
even like for whatever reality t like 

2858
01:52:52,660 --> 01:52:54,260
everything's so processed and so fucking
prepared,

2859
01:52:54,290 --> 01:52:57,040
right?
That why can't something be a little rag

2860
01:52:57,041 --> 01:53:02,041
tag,
a little messy in real and maybe a 

2861
01:53:02,041 --> 01:53:02,570
little uncomfortable and really have an 
amazing moment.

2862
01:53:02,570 --> 01:53:03,110
Well,
for you,

2863
01:53:03,111 --> 01:53:08,111
I think this is very important because I
think you're a very misunderstood guy 

2864
01:53:08,111 --> 01:53:09,620
and the ability to express yourself for 
long periods of time,

2865
01:53:09,621 --> 01:53:13,070
we'll get a chance for someone to see 
your real personality as opposed to this

2866
01:53:13,071 --> 01:53:15,830
projected image that they have.
I get that.

2867
01:53:16,020 --> 01:53:21,020
You know,
so this is like an a great medium 

2868
01:53:21,020 --> 01:53:23,321
because if you're doing like a fucking 
tonight show set or something that 

2869
01:53:23,321 --> 01:53:23,321
you're sitting on the couch,
you're talking for seven minutes.

2870
01:53:23,321 --> 01:53:24,230
To me it always feels like it's over.
That's it.

2871
01:53:24,231 --> 01:53:25,100
It's over.
It's like,

2872
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:28,590
I don't even know who has I was.
I mean that I get it outright,

2873
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:33,600
right?
You know that I just fucking force this 

2874
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:33,600
seven minutes.
Yeah.

2875
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:34,580
Fuck yeah.
So nobody really.

2876
01:53:34,581 --> 01:53:39,581
I mean,
this is a fantastic opportunity that we 

2877
01:53:39,581 --> 01:53:42,221
have today to do something like this.
This didn't exist for a performance of 

2878
01:53:42,221 --> 01:53:42,221
other generations.
I mean the uh,

2879
01:53:42,221 --> 01:53:44,690
the ability to let people really know 
who you are,

2880
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:46,400
warts and all this is,
this is,

2881
01:53:46,430 --> 01:53:47,630
this is exactly who we are

2882
01:53:47,670 --> 01:53:52,670
in seeing comics and however many 
entertainers like go from this to 

2883
01:53:52,670 --> 01:53:57,050
getting that fame or fan base or 
whatever it is without anybody in the 

2884
01:53:57,050 --> 01:53:58,290
middle of it without managers and 
agents.

2885
01:53:58,291 --> 01:54:00,300
And it's pretty incredible.
Man.

2886
01:54:00,330 --> 01:54:00,660
Bob.

2887
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:04,230
Bob Burnham was Bo.
Bo Burnham Burnham,

2888
01:54:04,240 --> 01:54:09,240
he's like 18 or something as a really 
young kid kind of open for me in New 

2889
01:54:09,240 --> 01:54:09,660
Hampshire.
He's killing him everywhere.

2890
01:54:09,661 --> 01:54:13,440
He did a bunch of Shit on Youtube and 
people love to songs on Youtube,

2891
01:54:13,441 --> 01:54:16,560
like comedic songs and all of a sudden 
this kid is fucking packing place.

2892
01:54:16,590 --> 01:54:17,250
Right?
I mean,

2893
01:54:17,251 --> 01:54:19,500
it's incredible.
Just because of the Internet.

2894
01:54:19,501 --> 01:54:23,860
No one had that kid that was on Ellen,
that kid that sang that Papa Razzi Song.

2895
01:54:24,340 --> 01:54:29,340
The Lady Gaga Song was brilliant.
It was like a school talent festival or 

2896
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:31,110
something like that and this kid was 
fucking brilliant.

2897
01:54:33,270 --> 01:54:35,520
It's amazing.
It's like you instantly,

2898
01:54:35,740 --> 01:54:40,740
you know,
can connect to people that just weren't 

2899
01:54:40,740 --> 01:54:40,740
available before you before you had to 
go through magazines.

2900
01:54:40,740 --> 01:54:45,580
But let's be devil's advocate for a 
minute because how fucking quickly is 

2901
01:54:45,580 --> 01:54:45,660
that kid fucked up now?
Oh,

2902
01:54:45,670 --> 01:54:50,240
he's dying because there's no fights 
like he's out of that fucking play.

2903
01:54:50,241 --> 01:54:52,280
No tandem jump for him.
No fucking.

2904
01:54:52,281 --> 01:54:54,380
Let's do a thousand hours 11,
right?

2905
01:54:54,440 --> 01:54:55,670
Isn't he?
11 or something like that.

2906
01:54:55,671 --> 01:54:57,410
So he's 11.
That's the scary.

2907
01:54:57,740 --> 01:54:59,540
There will be a certain.
Chew them up,

2908
01:54:59,541 --> 01:55:04,541
spit them out.
Process with some of these people that 

2909
01:55:04,541 --> 01:55:04,541
you know that make it through there.
It's like people who win the lottery,

2910
01:55:04,541 --> 01:55:06,200
most people who fucking play the lottery
or like,

2911
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:08,480
you know,
fucking got nothing.

2912
01:55:08,481 --> 01:55:09,320
No.
You know,

2913
01:55:09,350 --> 01:55:11,000
and then you see that documentary on 
Hbo.

2914
01:55:11,010 --> 01:55:13,650
You see lucky these fucking people that 
had the water.

2915
01:55:13,660 --> 01:55:18,660
They're nowhere near prepared.
People who are already rich know how to 

2916
01:55:18,660 --> 01:55:22,331
have money.
People who have nothing and they get 

2917
01:55:22,331 --> 01:55:22,331
rich get fucking crazy.
Yeah.

2918
01:55:22,331 --> 01:55:22,690
Crazy Huh?

2919
01:55:22,980 --> 01:55:24,720
When I first bought my first development
deal,

2920
01:55:24,721 --> 01:55:29,721
my manager thought I had a gambling 
problem and it was because I was buying 

2921
01:55:29,721 --> 01:55:29,721
lobster like every night

2922
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:32,770
eating like a king.
That will be nice.

2923
01:55:33,130 --> 01:55:35,950
I got a fat check and I just went off 
like a rocket.

2924
01:55:36,010 --> 01:55:37,840
I was spending like 10 grand a month and
he was like,

2925
01:55:37,841 --> 01:55:39,010
what the fuck are you doing?
I'm like,

2926
01:55:39,011 --> 01:55:43,190
I'm having fun pitch.
The first money I ever had in,

2927
01:55:43,230 --> 01:55:48,230
the dumbest thing I probably ever did 
was I logged in and again this is when 

2928
01:55:48,230 --> 01:55:48,230
the Internet,
like 56 k modem.

2929
01:55:48,230 --> 01:55:51,330
I logged into like a poker fucking 
website and I,

2930
01:55:51,470 --> 01:55:52,500
and I'm like,
I'm going to play poker.

2931
01:55:52,501 --> 01:55:57,501
I'm pretty good at poker.
I lost five grand in my underwear and 

2932
01:55:57,501 --> 01:55:58,200
about six minutes.
Wow.

2933
01:55:58,201 --> 01:55:59,940
Literally in the middle of the fucking 
night.

2934
01:55:59,941 --> 01:56:03,180
I remember pushing my,
my ibm thinkpad away from me going,

2935
01:56:03,870 --> 01:56:07,500
I can never do this again.
Five grand like that.

2936
01:56:07,930 --> 01:56:11,350
Wow.
I love Internet gambling.

2937
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:14,540
I love the idea.
I'm scared that it's fucking rig though.

2938
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:18,070
Come on Joe.
Come on man.

2939
01:56:18,100 --> 01:56:21,430
I wonder because if you.
You can play guys on quake and they'd be

2940
01:56:21,431 --> 01:56:23,580
bots and they would never miss.
They would just destroy,

2941
01:56:23,590 --> 01:56:25,000
right?
Like literally 100.

2942
01:56:25,001 --> 01:56:26,290
No,
you'd never come close to them.

2943
01:56:26,470 --> 01:56:28,270
They would know where you were at all 
times.

2944
01:56:28,271 --> 01:56:33,271
They know exactly the right weapon that 
we use because they weren't really 

2945
01:56:33,271 --> 01:56:35,551
playing.
It was just a computer simulation that 

2946
01:56:35,551 --> 01:56:35,551
was playing perfectly.
Right.

2947
01:56:35,551 --> 01:56:35,870
These poker things.
Not only that,

2948
01:56:35,871 --> 01:56:38,600
but who's to say who's to say somebody 
is in playing.

2949
01:56:38,870 --> 01:56:43,870
It has like a screen open of like our 
best odds on hands and emitting else.

2950
01:56:43,931 --> 01:56:48,931
So it's like sure hackers that just 
haven't been caught that are sitting 

2951
01:56:48,931 --> 01:56:48,931
there like,
you know,

2952
01:56:48,931 --> 01:56:51,010
call of duty behind a wall and like 
watching for sure.

2953
01:56:51,020 --> 01:56:52,550
We used to play chess online.
Then I'm like,

2954
01:56:52,551 --> 01:56:56,840
some fucking fag is gonna.
Have a chest fucking master thing opened

2955
01:56:56,841 --> 01:57:00,100
up and he knows 10 moves ahead already.
Doe

2956
01:57:00,150 --> 01:57:01,590
for chest,
you shouldn't even care.

2957
01:57:01,591 --> 01:57:02,640
Let them cheat.
Go ahead.

2958
01:57:02,700 --> 01:57:07,700
You know it's only gonna.
Make you better when you're playing 

2959
01:57:07,700 --> 01:57:07,700
someone in chest.
He used to play the tough,

2960
01:57:07,700 --> 01:57:08,550
tough people.
Scrabble,

2961
01:57:08,610 --> 01:57:11,280
everyone's addicted to scrabble apps and
facebook,

2962
01:57:11,281 --> 01:57:13,230
scrabble.
Real so many websites.

2963
01:57:13,231 --> 01:57:15,450
You just sit there and you type in what 
you have,

2964
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:17,340
what,
what's been replaced,

2965
01:57:17,341 --> 01:57:20,670
and they'll tell you the best word you 
know from the dictionaries points.

2966
01:57:20,671 --> 01:57:22,260
So play scrabble,
play old school,

2967
01:57:22,261 --> 01:57:23,880
just a table and some people sitting 
around.

2968
01:57:23,881 --> 01:57:28,881
That's the only one that we live in.
A society where people feel victorious 

2969
01:57:28,881 --> 01:57:28,980
when they figure out the best way to 
cheat.

2970
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:32,730
If I can figure out how to cheat out,
cheat you,

2971
01:57:32,970 --> 01:57:34,300
I'm fucking great.
I'm.

2972
01:57:34,301 --> 01:57:37,410
I'm more amazing than you at something.
It's fucking insane.

2973
01:57:37,860 --> 01:57:40,230
Is Pretty interesting.
But you think about the Russian mom.

2974
01:57:40,231 --> 01:57:42,330
How much money the Russian mom was made 
by cheating,

2975
01:57:42,630 --> 01:57:44,970
by made,
by getting people's credit cards made by

2976
01:57:44,980 --> 01:57:45,420
hacking.

2977
01:57:45,420 --> 01:57:46,460
Things made by,
you know,

2978
01:57:46,461 --> 01:57:51,461
doing that.
It's like when you realize the actual 

2979
01:57:51,461 --> 01:57:51,461
numbers involved,
like it's,

2980
01:57:51,461 --> 01:57:51,461
you know,
it's fuck,

2981
01:57:51,461 --> 01:57:52,970
it's a,
it's a branch of business.

2982
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:55,240
I mean it literally is a branch of 
business.

2983
01:57:55,250 --> 01:57:58,650
Do you think people's,
a branch of business ripping people off,

2984
01:57:58,651 --> 01:58:00,510
ripping off their websites,
hacking into their shit,

2985
01:58:00,511 --> 01:58:02,850
getting credit card numbers.
It's a branch of business.

2986
01:58:02,851 --> 01:58:07,851
I mean it's like this is sophisticated 
Chen and this is being sophisticated 

2987
01:58:07,851 --> 01:58:11,421
stuff being done on a high level.
Whenever you're going to have any sort 

2988
01:58:11,421 --> 01:58:11,421
of a situation like that where there's 
kind of an open door,

2989
01:58:11,421 --> 01:58:16,310
you know,
and there's programs you could run 

2990
01:58:16,310 --> 01:58:18,111
programs in the background.
Think about how many goddamn viruses 

2991
01:58:18,111 --> 01:58:18,111
there are,
you know,

2992
01:58:18,111 --> 01:58:20,850
I mean viruses and the loggers and fuck 
man,

2993
01:58:21,180 --> 01:58:23,070
everything's going into the cloud,
man.

2994
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:24,810
Everything's going.
It's sky bet,

2995
01:58:24,811 --> 01:58:26,070
dude.
It's happening.

2996
01:58:26,071 --> 01:58:27,810
Totally cool.
Bill is Sky Net,

2997
01:58:27,811 --> 01:58:29,040
right?
Google is.

2998
01:58:29,130 --> 01:58:34,130
I use it.
It's happening in email and I use the 

2999
01:58:34,130 --> 01:58:35,880
chrome browser because that uses a whole
bunch of websites dedicated to that too.

3000
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:39,330
Everything's.
That's Kinda weird man.

3001
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:42,490
It's freaky when you think about like 
pretty soon everything,

3002
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:45,070
access to everything all the time

3003
01:58:46,110 --> 01:58:49,710
and computer power is exponentially 
increasing.

3004
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:52,310
So the,
the kind of programs that kind of things

3005
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:53,820
that computers can do is going to 
change.

3006
01:58:53,821 --> 01:58:55,980
Drag drastically over the next few 
years.

3007
01:58:56,250 --> 01:58:58,290
But I watched a thing on dateline the 
other night.

3008
01:58:58,291 --> 01:59:01,750
It was about a woman who fell for the 
scam of like a,

3009
01:59:02,210 --> 01:59:03,540
you know,
contact us.

3010
01:59:03,541 --> 01:59:07,750
There's a million dollars in a bank 
account and I couldn't believe it.

3011
01:59:07,751 --> 01:59:09,090
It was like this woman was like,
Oh,

3012
01:59:09,091 --> 01:59:12,360
I'm a $300,000
down because they keep writing me saying

3013
01:59:12,361 --> 01:59:15,970
we need more money to get the money out.
And I get those all time.

3014
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,280
Time.
You people are crazy.

3015
01:59:17,290 --> 01:59:22,290
You have write them back.
Sometimes I'll read them back just for 

3016
01:59:22,290 --> 01:59:24,061
the hell of it to be like a whole email 
folders says scams and it's just 

3017
01:59:24,061 --> 01:59:26,470
conversations that I have with fucking 
terrorists.

3018
01:59:26,890 --> 01:59:28,930
That's you gotta.
You gotTa Post that Shit.

3019
01:59:28,940 --> 01:59:30,850
That's fucking weird to me.

3020
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:34,260
I get like I get at least one a day.

3021
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:36,100

3024
01:59:41,790 --> 01:59:44,790

3025
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:47,050
ah,

3026
01:59:47,051 --> 01:59:49,210
There's $3,
million dollars in cash here.

3027
01:59:49,540 --> 01:59:52,610
I'm looking for someone who can come up 
with a small deposit to get out the,

3028
01:59:52,620 --> 01:59:54,640
you know the box.
Like that's it.

3029
01:59:54,670 --> 01:59:59,670
Fuck man.
But a lot of people get fooled by those 

3030
01:59:59,670 --> 01:59:59,670
Nigerians.

3031
01:59:59,670 --> 02:00:02,760
Apparently.
It's a get for those key where they 

3032
02:00:02,760 --> 02:00:05,970
think it's facebook and you type in your
username every day is a new person on 

3033
02:00:06,130 --> 02:00:07,720
facebook or something like that.
Yeah,

3034
02:00:07,930 --> 02:00:10,060
phishing sites or big man,

3035
02:00:10,180 --> 02:00:11,500
look,
people are fucking crafty.

3036
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:13,090
You gave somebody my phone number 
member,

3037
02:00:13,210 --> 02:00:15,010
some dude you thought was really cliffy 
be.

3038
02:00:15,100 --> 02:00:15,710
Oh,
that's right.

3039
02:00:17,620 --> 02:00:19,060
I started getting phone calls.
I'm like,

3040
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:20,800
fuck bro.
Shit.

3041
02:00:21,080 --> 02:00:22,210
It's like,
I thought it was a real cliff.

3042
02:00:22,220 --> 02:00:26,370
He was a good trick to.
It was not a good address.

3043
02:00:26,490 --> 02:00:28,180
Well,
I mean for if it tricked me,

3044
02:00:28,181 --> 02:00:31,850
you know it's a little bit better.
It was new and lazy.

3045
02:00:32,230 --> 02:00:37,230
Myspace account became a fan boy.
Everything you were a fan boy and he 

3046
02:00:37,331 --> 02:00:39,550
didn't pay attention to the actual 
address.

3047
02:00:39,830 --> 02:00:42,570
Whatever they cloned his weapon.
God.

3048
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:43,940
God,
God,

3049
02:00:44,390 --> 02:00:45,020
God.
God.

3050
02:00:45,540 --> 02:00:47,170
At least it ain't twitter.
My phone number.

3051
02:00:47,490 --> 02:00:52,370
I did twitter,
my phone number or DM to somebody.

3052
02:00:52,371 --> 02:00:53,770
Yeah,
fucked up.

3053
02:00:53,890 --> 02:00:55,750
But I kept it as a fan line.
It's fascinating.

3054
02:00:56,020 --> 02:00:58,570
I'll just turn it on in the middle of 
nowhere and start answering calls.

3055
02:00:58,600 --> 02:00:59,450
Joe Rogan.
Fan Line.

3056
02:00:59,700 --> 02:01:03,210
Start talking to people.
That's why you got to get st man.

3057
02:01:03,340 --> 02:01:04,870
Yeah.
It sounds like the coolest Shit,

3058
02:01:04,890 --> 02:01:06,010

That APP is great,

3059
02:01:06,011 --> 02:01:06,840
man.
I will get.

3060
02:01:07,080 --> 02:01:09,220
Get it can ring your phone.
They never know your phone number.

3061
02:01:09,430 --> 02:01:10,600
You go live.
I do a thing.

3062
02:01:10,610 --> 02:01:12,040
I go live.
You hit a button,

3063
02:01:12,130 --> 02:01:17,130
sends it to everybody and then they can 
just call like a radio station like 

3064
02:01:17,130 --> 02:01:17,130
this.
Rolling.

3065
02:01:17,130 --> 02:01:21,810
Are they located in San Francisco?
Is the headquarters located in San 

3066
02:01:21,810 --> 02:01:21,810
Francisco?
Yeah,

3067
02:01:21,810 --> 02:01:21,810
I believe so,
yeah,

3068
02:01:22,050 --> 02:01:24,820
because I met someone who was trying to 
get me to do that years ago.

3069
02:01:24,821 --> 02:01:26,620
I would.
Of course I blew it off then.

3070
02:01:26,621 --> 02:01:27,450
You should do it.
Yeah.

3071
02:01:27,460 --> 02:01:28,450
No,
I'm on it.

3072
02:01:28,540 --> 02:01:33,540
What other things?
What other things do you do for 

3073
02:01:33,540 --> 02:01:35,521
promotion?
How many different things are you 

3074
02:01:35,521 --> 02:01:35,521
involved in?
Just a few.

3075
02:01:35,521 --> 02:01:35,521
One of yourself.

3076
02:01:35,521 --> 02:01:35,570
Human.
I'd do the same now.

3077
02:01:35,660 --> 02:01:37,760
Obviously facebook,
uh,

3078
02:01:37,830 --> 02:01:38,840
you know,
the twitter stuff,

3079
02:01:39,290 --> 02:01:40,000
not,
not a lot,

3080
02:01:40,050 --> 02:01:40,970
man.
Those are like the,

3081
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,010
those I don't do for.
I don't know what foursquare is.

3082
02:01:43,020 --> 02:01:46,880
Why I hate that shit.
Why would you want it to be the stalker?

3083
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:47,840
What does that.
Hey,

3084
02:01:47,841 --> 02:01:50,630
I'm at applebee's.
Here's the exact location I am here.

3085
02:01:51,220 --> 02:01:54,890
Oh,
that's not going to happen.

3086
02:01:54,891 --> 02:01:56,450
What is that?
My location stuff.

3087
02:01:56,451 --> 02:01:57,830
Like why?
Why would you want to do that?

3088
02:01:58,010 --> 02:02:00,800
There's an app on your ipad where you 
could just sit here and put your address

3089
02:02:00,801 --> 02:02:02,510
in.
It would show you all your neighbors who

3090
02:02:02,511 --> 02:02:04,430
have twittered or at least who have 
said,

3091
02:02:04,431 --> 02:02:07,070
yes,
you can use my patients in twitter.

3092
02:02:07,130 --> 02:02:09,260
You can see who's in your neighborhood 
is twittering.

3093
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:11,150
Ridiculous.
Yeah,

3094
02:02:11,220 --> 02:02:12,980
that's creepy.
There's like four.

3095
02:02:13,010 --> 02:02:18,010
I just read,
there's like 45 apps right now in the 

3096
02:02:18,010 --> 02:02:21,011
APP store that have coded it so that 
people can log in and get your contacts 

3097
02:02:21,011 --> 02:02:21,011
list.

3098
02:02:21,011 --> 02:02:21,410
Really?
Jesus Christ.

3099
02:02:21,411 --> 02:02:22,320
Yeah.
Yeah.

3100
02:02:22,470 --> 02:02:25,430
There's a year old kid put up handy like
two weeks ago.

3101
02:02:25,431 --> 02:02:26,360
Right?
Right.

3102
02:02:26,361 --> 02:02:27,550
And it was loud.
Tethering,

3103
02:02:28,170 --> 02:02:29,750
tethering.
40th five.

3104
02:02:29,780 --> 02:02:31,700
That's how many.
They admit there's like 45.

3105
02:02:31,701 --> 02:02:36,701
Then I'll let you know.
What's crazy is what's even worse is 

3106
02:02:36,701 --> 02:02:38,561
android.
When an android there was so many bad 

3107
02:02:38,561 --> 02:02:41,591
rogue apps,
like I downloaded a weather app and it 

3108
02:02:41,591 --> 02:02:41,591
was just supposed to give me the weather
and it was like,

3109
02:02:41,591 --> 02:02:46,450
this is going to take your contact list.
You know how it gives you the warnings 

3110
02:02:46,450 --> 02:02:46,450
of all of the things.
That was like five different things.

3111
02:02:46,450 --> 02:02:46,780
I was like,
why?

3112
02:02:46,850 --> 02:02:49,340
This is a weather app.
Why is it named my contacts?

3113
02:02:49,341 --> 02:02:51,500
This is how much of a fucking scoundrel 
I am right now.

3114
02:02:51,501 --> 02:02:52,460
When you're single.
Again,

3115
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:57,720
I had a girl call me randomly and 
because I know my numbers out there 

3116
02:02:57,720 --> 02:02:57,720
sometimes when people can,
you know,

3117
02:02:57,720 --> 02:02:58,820
people do post shit.
It's like you change your number,

3118
02:02:58,821 --> 02:03:00,710
what's 12?
So middle of the night I'm like,

3119
02:03:00,711 --> 02:03:01,570
hello,
you know,

3120
02:03:01,610 --> 02:03:04,130
giggling and is this Dane?
And I'm like,

3121
02:03:04,680 --> 02:03:05,680
yeah,
yeah.

3122
02:03:05,720 --> 02:03:07,640
What's up?
Where did you get this number?

3123
02:03:07,700 --> 02:03:08,810
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

3124
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:11,250
And then finally she sounded so hot that
I was like,

3125
02:03:11,510 --> 02:03:12,350
where are you guys ready?

3126
02:03:14,070 --> 02:03:14,860
I was like,
age,

3127
02:03:14,861 --> 02:03:15,550
sex,
location.

3128
02:03:15,551 --> 02:03:16,390
How old are you guys?
We're like,

3129
02:03:16,420 --> 02:03:17,120
Oh,
we're 20 zero.

3130
02:03:17,490 --> 02:03:18,740
He goes in La,
what's up?

3131
02:03:18,910 --> 02:03:19,740
Send a picture.
So.

3132
02:03:20,610 --> 02:03:22,660
So they sent a picture.
You're single again.

3133
02:03:22,661 --> 02:03:24,290
You're like,
no,

3134
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:28,460
laws that govern me.
Fucking take full advantage of that.

3135
02:03:28,461 --> 02:03:32,140
That's crazy magic trick you have.
It doesn't feel like a crazy magic trick

3136
02:03:33,530 --> 02:03:35,480
as long as you recognize it's a magic 
trick.

3137
02:03:35,481 --> 02:03:38,170
The real problems with dudes who have 
the magic trick.

3138
02:03:38,180 --> 02:03:41,260
Don't think it's a trick.
I think I am this fucking special.

3139
02:03:41,261 --> 02:03:41,560
Yeah.
Yeah.

3140
02:03:41,690 --> 02:03:42,170
You know,
there's,

3141
02:03:42,171 --> 02:03:45,310
that's an easy soup to start drinking.
No,

3142
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:50,270
I never forget and go a guy that 
couldn't fuck get it done.

3143
02:03:50,660 --> 02:03:52,970
I had no gay.
I had no fucking approach.

3144
02:03:53,120 --> 02:03:55,190
So yeah,
I'm constantly reminded.

3145
02:03:55,850 --> 02:03:58,100
Strange thing when people are under the 
spell,

3146
02:03:58,430 --> 02:04:00,830
you know when they're looking at someone
famous and you see that their,

3147
02:04:00,930 --> 02:04:03,290
their heart's beating fast and their 
hands are shaking.

3148
02:04:03,590 --> 02:04:08,590
Wow.
Just just because they've seen your 

3149
02:04:08,590 --> 02:04:10,931
image broadcast somewhere or they 
thought you did something that they 

3150
02:04:10,931 --> 02:04:10,931
enjoy it.
Be With Steve Matrix.

3151
02:04:11,220 --> 02:04:12,500
Steve Martin.
That's how it would be.

3152
02:04:13,130 --> 02:04:15,910
Steve Martin says,
be like painfully matrix.

3153
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:17,840
They just want to believe that stakes.
Real fuck it.

3154
02:04:17,841 --> 02:04:20,930
I don't care if it's that real.
Still to this day.

3155
02:04:20,931 --> 02:04:23,030
I'll go back and listen to.
Let's get small.

3156
02:04:23,900 --> 02:04:25,820
Fuck.
You know,

3157
02:04:25,821 --> 02:04:29,490
especially for them maybe when was,
it was at like 78 or something like that

3158
02:04:30,020 --> 02:04:31,190
right before the jerk.
Right.

3159
02:04:31,191 --> 02:04:32,630
Wasn't that like right before the jerk?
Yep.

3160
02:04:32,780 --> 02:04:33,710
Fuck man.

3161
02:04:33,830 --> 02:04:36,130
And he told me I was asking her about 
the jerk because as much as I could,

3162
02:04:36,160 --> 02:04:38,340
I was like you.
Once he warmed up,

3163
02:04:38,341 --> 02:04:39,930
I was like,
tell me a little about the jerk.

3164
02:04:39,931 --> 02:04:40,620
And He,
you know,

3165
02:04:40,621 --> 02:04:45,621
he was like,
I was just driving to the Gig everyday 

3166
02:04:45,621 --> 02:04:45,621
with Carl Reiner and we're like,
is this funny?

3167
02:04:45,621 --> 02:04:49,490
Is this funny?
They were just doing more comics do and 

3168
02:04:49,490 --> 02:04:49,490
then get to set and make it work.
Wow.

3169
02:04:49,490 --> 02:04:49,620
Yeah.
Yeah.

3170
02:04:49,621 --> 02:04:52,020
They were like,
we had no clue what we were doing or how

3171
02:04:52,021 --> 02:04:57,021
big that was going to be.
I want to know what happened with them 

3172
02:04:57,021 --> 02:04:57,240
because there was definitely a point in 
his time kind of after planes,

3173
02:04:57,241 --> 02:05:02,241
trains and automobiles around Grand 
Canyon Times or it seemed like he just 

3174
02:05:02,241 --> 02:05:05,631
stopped playing Steve Martin and started
acting like a old man or something like 

3175
02:05:05,631 --> 02:05:10,400
no more crazy.
He was forcing the crazy feeling that a 

3176
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:11,130
lot of comics who don't want to be like,
you got to take me serious.

3177
02:05:11,131 --> 02:05:16,131
A lot of comics go through that phase 
where it's like I'm a serious human 

3178
02:05:16,131 --> 02:05:18,210
being stopped smoking weed.
That weird thing.

3179
02:05:18,211 --> 02:05:18,600
Where were

3180
02:05:18,660 --> 02:05:23,660
comics want to be taken seriously?
And they start like making points on 

3181
02:05:23,660 --> 02:05:24,570
stage that aren't funny.
Yeah.

3182
02:05:25,470 --> 02:05:27,450
I worked with this comic once.
I'm not going to say his name,

3183
02:05:27,451 --> 02:05:29,730
but he's a political guy,
pretty famous guy,

3184
02:05:30,090 --> 02:05:35,090
and he did this line and then he said 
that usually gets an applause break and 

3185
02:05:37,010 --> 02:05:39,270
it wasn't.
It wasn't even remotely funny.

3186
02:05:39,271 --> 02:05:44,271
It was some silly fucking Democrat 
versus Republican point that should be 

3187
02:05:44,271 --> 02:05:46,380
obvious to anybody who's paying 
attention and it was just like,

3188
02:05:46,381 --> 02:05:48,330
wow,
like you're going for that.

3189
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:53,360
Like they,
they lose this perspective and all of a 

3190
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:54,660
sudden they start thinking that they're 
like this voice over

3191
02:05:55,140 --> 02:05:58,410
and people need to hear like,
come on

3192
02:05:58,430 --> 02:05:59,990
man,
you're supposed to just be funny.

3193
02:06:00,030 --> 02:06:05,030
Right?
If you don't have anything funny to say 

3194
02:06:05,030 --> 02:06:05,360
about a subject or if it's not setting 
up something funny later.

3195
02:06:05,680 --> 02:06:06,470
No,
I understand.

3196
02:06:06,471 --> 02:06:11,471
If you want to get a point across or 
give a perspective that may not be 

3197
02:06:11,471 --> 02:06:12,530
funny,
but it gives us your point of view.

3198
02:06:12,531 --> 02:06:17,531
So I understand what you're talking 
about when you say some funny shit 

3199
02:06:17,531 --> 02:06:17,531
later,
but if you start preaching,

3200
02:06:17,531 --> 02:06:17,531
that's a fucking tricky

3201
02:06:17,531 --> 02:06:17,770
thing,
right?

3202
02:06:17,800 --> 02:06:18,430
Yeah,
yeah.

3203
02:06:18,431 --> 02:06:18,730
No,
no,

3204
02:06:18,760 --> 02:06:21,160
that's not many guys can do it though a 
lot,

3205
02:06:21,161 --> 02:06:21,640
right?
Yeah.

3206
02:06:21,641 --> 02:06:26,641
Yeah,
and it seemed like there was like a 

3207
02:06:26,641 --> 02:06:26,641
phase,
not as much now,

3208
02:06:26,641 --> 02:06:26,641
but a few years ago where everybody was 
trying to do that.

3209
02:06:26,641 --> 02:06:27,790
You know,
where everybody was like,

3210
02:06:27,820 --> 02:06:32,820
this is the point in my career.
I'm going to dim the lights and do bill 

3211
02:06:32,820 --> 02:06:32,890
Maher real talk,
right?

3212
02:06:32,950 --> 02:06:34,760
It's like,
no,

3213
02:06:34,810 --> 02:06:36,490
I'm there.
I'm there for fucking sucks man.

3214
02:06:36,550 --> 02:06:38,050
I'm there to make you laugh your ass 
off.

3215
02:06:38,051 --> 02:06:39,700
I'm there to make you escape for a 
little bit.

3216
02:06:40,060 --> 02:06:41,950
There's a lot of fucking guys that do 
it,

3217
02:06:41,951 --> 02:06:43,810
you know,
a thousand times better than me,

3218
02:06:43,811 --> 02:06:48,610
but I figured out how to do it my way to
where I can entertain you and we can all

3219
02:06:48,611 --> 02:06:50,650
forget about the real hardcore shit for 
a little bit.

3220
02:06:50,830 --> 02:06:53,810
That's all I'm supposed to do.
Really.

3221
02:06:53,890 --> 02:06:56,560
I can do some flicks if I can produce 
some TV stuff.

3222
02:06:56,800 --> 02:06:57,520
Great.

3223
02:06:57,630 --> 02:07:00,580
I love comedy.
That doesn't have to mean shit like Joey

3224
02:07:00,580 --> 02:07:05,580
Diaz,
one of my favorite guys to watch ever 

3225
02:07:05,580 --> 02:07:05,580
because everything is okay.

3226
02:07:05,580 --> 02:07:08,430
My ass and my boss,
my Boston to everything ended up ending 

3227
02:07:11,510 --> 02:07:14,200
your joke.
It ended up off your ass.

3228
02:07:14,870 --> 02:07:19,870
Create like really deep thinkers and I 
appreciate people with really 

3229
02:07:19,870 --> 02:07:20,440
fascinating point of view,
but for the most part,

3230
02:07:20,620 --> 02:07:23,620
a lot of that stuff is not funny.
A lot of that stuff really.

3231
02:07:23,621 --> 02:07:28,621
It's almost,
you're disrespecting certain topics by 

3232
02:07:28,621 --> 02:07:28,621
doing them onstage.
I mean,

3233
02:07:28,621 --> 02:07:31,210
you can kinda like brush on it and like 
Kinda like you dabble in it,

3234
02:07:31,211 --> 02:07:33,460
but if it's a really fascinating 
subject,

3235
02:07:33,640 --> 02:07:34,870
it's something that needs to be 
explored.

3236
02:07:34,871 --> 02:07:38,800
It's going to share a funny but just 
just for flat out funny.

3237
02:07:38,950 --> 02:07:40,780
Like for me,
I like stupid shit.

3238
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:44,380
I look like a Joey Diaz type guy.
That's the kind of Shit I laugh at.

3239
02:07:44,590 --> 02:07:45,160
I wanna,
you know,

3240
02:07:45,180 --> 02:07:50,180
I wanna I wanna laugh at someone.
I mean I love good writing and 

3241
02:07:50,180 --> 02:07:50,180
everything like that,
but I love just as much.

3242
02:07:50,180 --> 02:07:51,180
You know,
Joey Diaz,

3243
02:07:51,370 --> 02:07:53,140
he's got this joke about transvestites.
He goes,

3244
02:07:53,470 --> 02:07:54,520
I love transvestites.

3245
02:07:54,580 --> 02:07:56,020
They Cook,
they clean.

3246
02:07:56,110 --> 02:07:58,810
You can beat on them.
Every once in a while the cops come,

3247
02:07:58,890 --> 02:08:03,890
who's going to believe me or some dude 
with a wig and a black guy that's like 

3248
02:08:03,890 --> 02:08:03,890
just bang,
Bang,

3249
02:08:03,890 --> 02:08:05,120
Bang.
I mean it's just laughing.

3250
02:08:05,870 --> 02:08:08,680
That's fucking tremendous job.
You know what I'm saying?

3251
02:08:08,681 --> 02:08:13,681
It's like that's my,
that's the kind of shit that will make 

3252
02:08:13,681 --> 02:08:14,080
me clap and laugh and then hours later 
it'll be at the diner eating,

3253
02:08:14,081 --> 02:08:16,230
clapping and laughing.
You know,

3254
02:08:16,750 --> 02:08:18,640
that's,
that's my favorite kind of comedy.

3255
02:08:18,670 --> 02:08:23,020
I like just stupid shit.
That's why I like old Steve Martin.

3256
02:08:23,770 --> 02:08:26,320
Exactly old.
Steve Martin was awesome.

3257
02:08:26,890 --> 02:08:30,340
Who are your favorite comics like today?
That work today?

3258
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:34,410
I just watched Berg and on letterman.
I think billy's just like,

3259
02:08:35,660 --> 02:08:37,740
he's one of the funniest guys out there 
and I think he,

3260
02:08:37,741 --> 02:08:38,670
you know,
he's like a,

3261
02:08:38,850 --> 02:08:41,460
he's an architect man.
He gets out there and he fucking figures

3262
02:08:41,461 --> 02:08:46,461
out and he's just funny.
It's just about fucking being funny and 

3263
02:08:46,461 --> 02:08:48,580
he's not going to use his power to do 
that.

3264
02:08:48,650 --> 02:08:51,720
Try to get funny cat man.
It's all pure.

3265
02:08:52,190 --> 02:08:54,600
I like to watch chapelle before,
you know,

3266
02:08:54,601 --> 02:08:55,790
he kind of disappeared,
you know?

3267
02:08:55,820 --> 02:08:59,760
I always appreciated watching dave get 
up the guy who's like on the same level

3268
02:08:59,770 --> 02:09:01,510
level as him,
like fame wise.

3269
02:09:01,511 --> 02:09:04,870
Does it freak you out that he doesn't 
fucking perform and these big places,

3270
02:09:04,871 --> 02:09:07,600
does it freak you out that like why 
don't you like,

3271
02:09:07,601 --> 02:09:08,920
let people know where you're going to 
be?

3272
02:09:08,921 --> 02:09:11,080
Man,
why don't you do more shows?

3273
02:09:11,310 --> 02:09:14,080
Like I'm just one of the best ever.
One of the best ever right now.

3274
02:09:14,370 --> 02:09:15,840
It's so rare.
I don't know,

3275
02:09:15,870 --> 02:09:17,650
Dave personally.
It's all like,

3276
02:09:17,651 --> 02:09:19,900
I don't have insight,
but just from what I hear,

3277
02:09:19,901 --> 02:09:20,830
you know,
he's just,

3278
02:09:20,860 --> 02:09:23,530
he's,
he's got some stuff to work out,

3279
02:09:23,710 --> 02:09:28,710
you know,
so maybe he's just not a place where he 

3280
02:09:28,710 --> 02:09:28,710
can face that head on.
I know I'm putting it together.

3281
02:09:28,710 --> 02:09:28,930
I know what you're talking about.

3282
02:09:29,270 --> 02:09:34,270
And I heard that crazy story about the 
whatever the hell happened on the 

3283
02:09:34,270 --> 02:09:36,090
airplane right where they had to land 
somewhere in the pilot.

3284
02:09:36,091 --> 02:09:37,910
I thought that he was a hazard to the 
flight.

3285
02:09:37,911 --> 02:09:39,520
So they landed early.
Yeah,

3286
02:09:39,560 --> 02:09:42,560
that's extreme.
That's extreme stuff.

3287
02:09:42,561 --> 02:09:44,180
I don't,
I don't know what the fuck is going on,

3288
02:09:44,181 --> 02:09:45,800
but I met him.
I did.

3289
02:09:45,860 --> 02:09:50,860
I mean the comedy clubs in New York and 
I did this show twice and he's just 

3290
02:09:50,860 --> 02:09:52,670
always been a cool dude,
but I never got to know him deep.

3291
02:09:52,910 --> 02:09:54,260
Yeah.
I don't think he's like that though.

3292
02:09:54,350 --> 02:09:56,720
I don't think a lot of people know him 
personally.

3293
02:09:56,721 --> 02:09:57,470
He's Kinda,
you know,

3294
02:09:57,890 --> 02:09:59,870
living in fucking Utah or somewhere and 
just.

3295
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:01,440
Yeah,
yeah,

3296
02:10:01,630 --> 02:10:02,530
yeah.
That's strange,

3297
02:10:02,531 --> 02:10:03,520
Huh?
Yeah.

3298
02:10:03,521 --> 02:10:08,521
But you know,
that's one of the things that I said 

3299
02:10:08,521 --> 02:10:08,521
also that I think people really love 
about him is the fact that he is kind of

3300
02:10:08,521 --> 02:10:13,081
reclusive.
He is kind of like the reluctant star 

3301
02:10:13,081 --> 02:10:13,900
and one of the things that people will 
like go after use like the,

3302
02:10:13,901 --> 02:10:15,910
you already have attention.
So they're like,

3303
02:10:15,911 --> 02:10:17,680
why is this fucking guy I want more 
attention,

3304
02:10:17,990 --> 02:10:22,990
you know,
fuck fucking attention to or look at 

3305
02:10:22,990 --> 02:10:22,990
this attention to or show your mouth 
attention,

3306
02:10:22,990 --> 02:10:22,990
whore,
you know,

3307
02:10:22,990 --> 02:10:27,981
it's like that's what it is.
Like people think that like when you 

3308
02:10:27,981 --> 02:10:27,981
promote,
if you're self promoting that somehow or

3309
02:10:27,981 --> 02:10:27,981
another,
you know,

3310
02:10:27,981 --> 02:10:30,180
you're doing something to them.
Sure.

3311
02:10:30,400 --> 02:10:32,770
You know,
do you get stop fucking spamming me

3312
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:36,740
any,
any level of success.

3313
02:10:36,741 --> 02:10:41,741
And what I've learned having you know,
against slow but short trajectory is 

3314
02:10:41,741 --> 02:10:43,890
like there's always more people that 
don't like what you do,

3315
02:10:43,891 --> 02:10:45,470
them corn like what you do and that's 
it.

3316
02:10:45,471 --> 02:10:50,471
And you just attract more,
more of people that like you more don't 

3317
02:10:50,471 --> 02:10:51,410
like you will be attracted to you and 
tell you.

3318
02:10:52,010 --> 02:10:52,520
Of course.

3319
02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:58,360
I'm totally hypocritical.
I hated a serious man and I went on 

3320
02:10:58,360 --> 02:10:58,360
twitter and I'm like,
seriously fucking suck.

3321
02:10:58,360 --> 02:11:03,360
You know,
if somebody could have seen me perform 

3322
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:03,360
and you know,
did the same thing,

3323
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:04,510
but that's okay though.
You got to realize that,

3324
02:11:04,511 --> 02:11:05,590
you know,
there's going to people,

3325
02:11:05,710 --> 02:11:08,460
there's a lot of music that I fucking 
love and you know,

3326
02:11:08,500 --> 02:11:11,020
if you know,
Mrs Rogan gets in the car with me.

3327
02:11:11,021 --> 02:11:12,430
She was like,
what the fuck are you listening?

3328
02:11:13,020 --> 02:11:13,690
And I'm like,
this is,

3329
02:11:13,691 --> 02:11:15,760
I was made for loving you.
Okay.

3330
02:11:16,150 --> 02:11:18,160
You don't know this.
You don't know this fucking song.

3331
02:11:19,070 --> 02:11:21,030
You know somebody likes your pelvis.
I mean,

3332
02:11:21,090 --> 02:11:23,340
regardless of what he's dealing with,
there's so many.

3333
02:11:23,430 --> 02:11:26,490
When Steve Martin did arenas,
Steve Martin was doing also,

3334
02:11:26,491 --> 02:11:28,980
he wasn't doing like,
when people say like arenas today,

3335
02:11:29,190 --> 02:11:30,330
yeah,
I'm doing maybe 20,000

3336
02:11:30,331 --> 02:11:33,060
people.
That dude was doing fucking 60,000

3337
02:11:33,061 --> 02:11:38,061
people in an arena where he was 
partitioned with no screens,

3338
02:11:38,370 --> 02:11:42,240
nothing man.
Mike white suit dot on the other side of

3339
02:11:42,241 --> 02:11:43,500
the place.
So you understand.

3340
02:11:43,850 --> 02:11:47,070
But with me,
it's like I have the most amazing,

3341
02:11:47,071 --> 02:11:49,230
like the guy that comes out,
my road guy,

3342
02:11:49,231 --> 02:11:50,760
Al Dot Lee.
He did Zeplin,

3343
02:11:50,761 --> 02:11:53,250
he did Elvis.
He's got all the gadgets.

3344
02:11:53,370 --> 02:11:58,370
We put screens.
We make you feel like you're in your 

3345
02:11:58,370 --> 02:11:58,370
living room.
I go in the middle,

3346
02:11:58,370 --> 02:12:01,530
not because I want to be a gladiator 
because it's four theaters at any point.

3347
02:12:01,590 --> 02:12:03,720
It's easier to be close to people from 
the middle.

3348
02:12:03,721 --> 02:12:05,940
It wasn't like a thing where it was 
like,

3349
02:12:05,941 --> 02:12:06,870
yeah,
by being in the middle,

3350
02:12:06,871 --> 02:12:08,290
I'm the.
I'm the rockstars.

3351
02:12:08,300 --> 02:12:13,300
No,
it was like I need to be as close to 

3352
02:12:13,300 --> 02:12:14,811
people in these big shows as positive.
Only done one theater in the round show 

3353
02:12:14,811 --> 02:12:14,811
ever.
Maybe to.

3354
02:12:14,811 --> 02:12:16,340
Was it a in Cape Cod?
No,

3355
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:21,230
I don't think it turned.
Remember that rally?

3356
02:12:21,231 --> 02:12:22,410
Yeah.
What was that one?

3357
02:12:22,790 --> 02:12:25,500
A minute where it would like the whole 
stage.

3358
02:12:25,510 --> 02:12:27,530
Was that feeling when it turned?
I think it was feminine.

3359
02:12:27,540 --> 02:12:28,080
It was phoenix.

3360
02:12:28,450 --> 02:12:30,400
Yeah.
I did something and it always weirded me

3361
02:12:30,401 --> 02:12:32,100
out that people are behind me,
you know,

3362
02:12:32,380 --> 02:12:37,380
fucking strange.
I'm performing and I'm not looking at 

3363
02:12:37,380 --> 02:12:37,380
these people behind me

3364
02:12:37,380 --> 02:12:37,380
that.
Yeah,

3365
02:12:37,380 --> 02:12:39,110
I couldn't get past that.
That was freaking me out,

3366
02:12:39,140 --> 02:12:40,970
but what's really is smarter,
right?

3367
02:12:41,320 --> 02:12:42,580
More,
more dynamic.

3368
02:12:42,581 --> 02:12:47,581
It's a three dimensional approach as 
opposed to standing in this one plane 

3369
02:12:47,581 --> 02:12:48,670
facing this one way every time.

3370
02:12:48,780 --> 02:12:49,300
Yeah.
When,

3371
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:54,320
when people are behind you too,
and I always keep a little light on 

3372
02:12:54,320 --> 02:12:56,931
everybody.
There's a constant flow of energy by 

3373
02:12:56,931 --> 02:12:59,991
seeing other people and feel it's just.
There's something unique about being in 

3374
02:12:59,991 --> 02:12:59,991
the middle,
like they're seeing people,

3375
02:12:59,991 --> 02:13:01,890
not just you,
not just seeing a stage,

3376
02:13:01,900 --> 02:13:06,900
a few.
They're seeing people watching you and 

3377
02:13:06,900 --> 02:13:06,900
that is an additive.
Oh,

3378
02:13:06,900 --> 02:13:06,900
that's interesting.
Absolutely.

3379
02:13:06,900 --> 02:13:07,230
It's an interesting way to look at it.
Yeah.

3380
02:13:07,231 --> 02:13:08,250
Like everybody's like,
Whoa,

3381
02:13:08,251 --> 02:13:13,251
we're on this together.
If you're just talking about audit 

3382
02:13:13,251 --> 02:13:13,251
energy level,
if you wanted to talk about that.

3383
02:13:13,251 --> 02:13:15,480
Like for me it's like what you put out 
there and it doesn't dissipate the way I

3384
02:13:15,481 --> 02:13:17,400
feel it does when you're just launching 
an APP.

3385
02:13:17,401 --> 02:13:22,230
Them like your mental look at me when 
they feel like they're part of it,

3386
02:13:22,260 --> 02:13:25,620
they're connected to it.
It's a different kind of comedy man.

3387
02:13:25,621 --> 02:13:27,180
It's a different show and the screens.
Look,

3388
02:13:27,181 --> 02:13:29,790
I got all four,
so even when my back's to you,

3389
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:32,010
there's never a seat.
Even if

3390
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:34,350
you're up top,
you're looking directly out at a,

3391
02:13:34,410 --> 02:13:35,310
at a,
at a screen.

3392
02:13:35,311 --> 02:13:38,070
So we figured out how to make it work.
That's pretty fucking bad.

3393
02:13:38,160 --> 02:13:38,420
Yeah.

3394
02:13:39,520 --> 02:13:42,310
It's got to be really strange.
Do shows for that many people.

3395
02:13:42,340 --> 02:13:44,560
What is it like to do a show for 20?
I think the most

3396
02:13:44,870 --> 02:13:46,640
come out and do it man.
Next time I do a Gig,

3397
02:13:46,820 --> 02:13:48,110
come out and do a,
you know,

3398
02:13:48,111 --> 02:13:50,070
come out and open.
I'm telling Ya know,

3399
02:13:50,090 --> 02:13:51,680
I'm serious man.
I always have people,

3400
02:13:51,681 --> 02:13:54,310
you know,
people have never done those silos shows

3401
02:13:54,320 --> 02:13:56,180
on the last door.
I just feel like to come out,

3402
02:13:56,181 --> 02:14:01,181
come out and uh,
it was great man and everybody thinks 

3403
02:14:01,181 --> 02:14:01,181
it's not going to work for me there.
It's like no.

3404
02:14:01,181 --> 02:14:03,110
First of all,
my fans are comedy fans.

3405
02:14:03,140 --> 02:14:04,740
They're not the kind of people that get 
like,

3406
02:14:04,741 --> 02:14:05,510
oh,
we're just waiting for.

3407
02:14:05,690 --> 02:14:07,400
They love comedy.
Most of my fans.

3408
02:14:07,910 --> 02:14:12,910
And you never want to go back once 
you've done big shows like that in the 

3409
02:14:12,910 --> 02:14:12,910
round man.
It's amazing.

3410
02:14:12,910 --> 02:14:13,190
Yeah.
Yeah,

3411
02:14:13,191 --> 02:14:14,480
I promise.
Very bizarre.

3412
02:14:14,510 --> 02:14:14,810
Yeah,
I know.

3413
02:14:14,811 --> 02:14:15,380
You dig it,
man.

3414
02:14:15,410 --> 02:14:20,410
You dig it.
I have a shiny bald spot in the back of 

3415
02:14:20,410 --> 02:14:20,410
my hand.
I need powder you up,

3416
02:14:20,410 --> 02:14:21,140
joe telling you right now.
I got all that shit.

3417
02:14:21,141 --> 02:14:22,970
Are you kidding me?
I'm thinking no.

3418
02:14:23,360 --> 02:14:26,510
Had had 20,000
people.

3419
02:14:26,511 --> 02:14:27,950
What is the biggest crowd you've ever 
performed?

3420
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:31,760
Gator growl data grounds.
Forty 8,000

3421
02:14:31,761 --> 02:14:32,330
in Florida.

3422
02:14:32,820 --> 02:14:34,010
Yeah,
Gainesville.

3423
02:14:34,610 --> 02:14:36,690
Damn.
Forty 8,000.

3424
02:14:37,250 --> 02:14:39,200
Holy Shit.
That was pretty cool.

3425
02:14:39,260 --> 02:14:40,700
What the fuck was that like?

3426
02:14:41,060 --> 02:14:46,010
That first laugh was like,
it came across the field.

3427
02:14:46,100 --> 02:14:51,100
That's insane.
But I would never want to do that size 

3428
02:14:51,100 --> 02:14:52,670
in that like a stadium.
If I could do that again doing it arena.

3429
02:14:52,700 --> 02:14:54,680
It's compact.
Everybody's right on you.

3430
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:55,520
And um,

3431
02:14:55,600 --> 02:15:00,280
keeps you imagine eating shit on stage 
in front of 48,000.

3432
02:15:01,410 --> 02:15:03,400
Imagine bombing.
Can you imagine hitting a job?

3433
02:15:03,401 --> 02:15:08,401
Especially if you did a controversial 
choke and they didn't like it and they 

3434
02:15:08,401 --> 02:15:10,690
turn on you 48,000
and maybe you got to still do another 40

3435
02:15:10,691 --> 02:15:11,020
minutes.

3436
02:15:11,460 --> 02:15:13,290
You better make sure that's what 
interests me.

3437
02:15:13,350 --> 02:15:16,290
I made sure my fans are showing up for 
this.

3438
02:15:16,920 --> 02:15:20,160
I'm not setting myself up for that.
Kind of still look back and remember the

3439
02:15:20,161 --> 02:15:22,170
first time you ever bombed?
Yeah.

3440
02:15:22,200 --> 02:15:24,690
Oh yeah.
A bunch of them I just wrote.

3441
02:15:24,830 --> 02:15:25,710
It's called New York.

3442
02:15:25,840 --> 02:15:29,270
I just,
I just wrote a chapter in this book.

3443
02:15:29,271 --> 02:15:31,610
I'm writing all on the very first time I
ever bombed,

3444
02:15:31,611 --> 02:15:34,120
which is a horrible,
terrible disaster that I,

3445
02:15:34,121 --> 02:15:39,121
I'll never forget cause it was the first
time I ever bombed while I was getting 

3446
02:15:39,121 --> 02:15:39,121
paid.
Oh Shit.

3447
02:15:39,121 --> 02:15:40,670
That's a big difference.
Balmy at open mic nights.

3448
02:15:40,671 --> 02:15:41,690
Everybody's bombing,
you know,

3449
02:15:41,691 --> 02:15:46,691
it's like there's like five people are 
gonna eat shit onstage and you're only 

3450
02:15:46,691 --> 02:15:46,691
up there for five minutes,
but once you do a paid.

3451
02:15:46,691 --> 02:15:48,140
And I was middling.
I shouldn't have been middling.

3452
02:15:48,141 --> 02:15:53,141
I really didn't have the time.
And the guy went on before me fucking 

3453
02:15:53,141 --> 02:15:53,141
crushed.
And uh,

3454
02:15:53,141 --> 02:15:57,220
there was this chick that I had seen the
last time I was there and she was super 

3455
02:15:57,220 --> 02:16:00,521
hot.
I fucked her and she was in the front 

3456
02:16:00,521 --> 02:16:02,261
row and she brought her friends and her 
friends look and they were going to sit 

3457
02:16:02,261 --> 02:16:02,870
in the front row when I went on stage,
so I was panicking.

3458
02:16:03,080 --> 02:16:08,080
I was like,
they're going to be like right in front 

3459
02:16:08,080 --> 02:16:08,080
of me.
I was only like a year and accommodate a

3460
02:16:08,080 --> 02:16:11,021
year and a half post and this guy went 
up who was the MC was way better than 

3461
02:16:11,021 --> 02:16:11,021
me.
He was.

3462
02:16:11,021 --> 02:16:12,350
He was already better than me and I was 
like,

3463
02:16:12,351 --> 02:16:15,350
I conned this fucking book to making me 
a middle.

3464
02:16:15,440 --> 02:16:16,750
I was like,
it's just a cocky dude.

3465
02:16:16,760 --> 02:16:17,290
I was like,
I can be.

3466
02:16:17,330 --> 02:16:18,050
I can middle.
Come on,

3467
02:16:18,051 --> 02:16:19,550
I can middle.
So he lets me move on.

3468
02:16:19,551 --> 02:16:23,840
This guy goes on stage and does and he 
stopped doing comedy.

3469
02:16:23,841 --> 02:16:25,280
It's really too bad.
He's a natural.

3470
02:16:25,281 --> 02:16:30,281
I don't remember his name unfortunately,
but he fucking killed and then I went 

3471
02:16:30,281 --> 02:16:34,230
him an eight just drive bricks of shit 
with no water for 20 minutes.

3472
02:16:34,930 --> 02:16:38,260
It was the most embarrassing feeling 
I've ever had in my life.

3473
02:16:38,260 --> 02:16:43,180
I couldn't believe how unbearable and 
her and her friends were like looking at

3474
02:16:43,181 --> 02:16:45,250
each other and her friends would lean 
over and say something like,

3475
02:16:46,330 --> 02:16:51,330
oh no,
and then I could hear crickets and I'm 

3476
02:16:51,330 --> 02:16:54,271
trying to be like extra loud because I'm
trying to like be trying to bring it 

3477
02:16:54,271 --> 02:16:58,411
back to my side.
So like you like forced the punchlines 

3478
02:16:58,411 --> 02:17:01,381
and the timing is all even worse.
And my only experience with being 

3479
02:17:01,381 --> 02:17:06,031
nervous before,
my only experience with pressure had 

3480
02:17:06,031 --> 02:17:08,581
been fighting.
So when you know fighting and 

3481
02:17:08,581 --> 02:17:08,581
tournaments,
you know,

3482
02:17:08,581 --> 02:17:09,020
if you're nervous,
you just turned inward and you say,

3483
02:17:09,021 --> 02:17:09,970
this isn't mine,
I want to do this,

3484
02:17:09,971 --> 02:17:14,971
I'm going to do this.
I'm going to do is I'm going to fucking 

3485
02:17:14,971 --> 02:17:14,971
explode.
I'm just going to go terrified.

3486
02:17:14,971 --> 02:17:19,531
But you just get psyched up to go.
Which is the worst thing you could ever 

3487
02:17:19,531 --> 02:17:22,801
do on stage to be nervous and aggressive
and fucking and all introspective and 

3488
02:17:22,801 --> 02:17:24,640
turned into yourself and to get faculty 
to take them are just going to call.

3489
02:17:24,680 --> 02:17:27,640
It was the worst mindset ever for 
comedy.

3490
02:17:28,140 --> 02:17:31,410
That's called being Carlos Mitzia.
Turn it in.

3491
02:17:31,411 --> 02:17:32,640
I'm going to explode

3492
02:17:33,100 --> 02:17:36,400
the most.
I had a shoe.

3493
02:17:36,760 --> 02:17:38,110
Did you ever do shows about microphones?

3494
02:17:38,420 --> 02:17:39,360
Oh yeah.
Yup.

3495
02:17:40,040 --> 02:17:42,080
Parties ever do a Bachelor party?
I did,

3496
02:17:42,081 --> 02:17:47,081
yeah.
I used to do like a colleges around 

3497
02:17:47,081 --> 02:17:47,081
Boston where they'd hire me and I'd be 
like,

3498
02:17:47,081 --> 02:17:52,020
I'd be standing on a pool table in the 
cafeteria.

3499
02:17:52,281 --> 02:17:53,020
Standing on a cliff.

3500
02:17:53,070 --> 02:17:54,510
Cheerio chair.
A table?

3501
02:17:54,570 --> 02:17:56,090
Yeah.
Rickety table.

3502
02:17:56,091 --> 02:17:58,230
Like I couldn't move that was there.
Their stage.

3503
02:17:58,360 --> 02:18:01,870
I did a place in in Florida called the 
rathskeller.

3504
02:18:02,320 --> 02:18:07,320
They hired me to come down and it was 
like one of my first road gigs and it 

3505
02:18:07,320 --> 02:18:10,801
was the thing where it's like there's 
food being served during the tvs are on 

3506
02:18:10,801 --> 02:18:14,431
edge,
like all that shit where it's like the 

3507
02:18:14,431 --> 02:18:15,931
whole everything is happening and I'm 
doing standup and like somebody threw a 

3508
02:18:15,931 --> 02:18:17,170
hot dog at me like five minutes into an 
hour.

3509
02:18:17,730 --> 02:18:19,280
Those gigs are so important.
Man.

3510
02:18:19,281 --> 02:18:24,281
All those shit gigs at Boston comedy 
used to book and all those little weird 

3511
02:18:24,281 --> 02:18:26,210
fucking places in New Hampshire.
You would drive an hour and a half up to

3512
02:18:26,780 --> 02:18:29,960
New Hampshire and do some weird bar with
a tinny sound system.

3513
02:18:30,410 --> 02:18:32,750
Those are so good though.
When you look back at it now,

3514
02:18:32,751 --> 02:18:37,751
like how important were those like for 
developing your ability to focus on 

3515
02:18:37,751 --> 02:18:39,630
stage and kill and cut the fat out of 
your act and

3516
02:18:40,070 --> 02:18:43,790
driving home from domain.
Once I got a gig up there and it was the

3517
02:18:43,791 --> 02:18:46,490
first time that there were a few years 
and I drove home and I'm like,

3518
02:18:46,660 --> 02:18:47,480
all right,
this,

3519
02:18:47,690 --> 02:18:49,790
this matters.
Even though it was horrible,

3520
02:18:49,820 --> 02:18:51,560
I was like,
this matters it this.

3521
02:18:51,561 --> 02:18:56,561
Someday I will look back on tonight.
Know that like I learned fucking 

3522
02:18:56,561 --> 02:18:57,200
something here.
Oh man,

3523
02:18:57,201 --> 02:18:58,580
but it was back.

3524
02:18:58,920 --> 02:19:00,810
Yeah.
You do those gigs and you just like,

3525
02:19:00,840 --> 02:19:01,850
wow.
Like this is.

3526
02:19:01,860 --> 02:19:03,660
This doesn't even feel like show 
business.

3527
02:19:03,661 --> 02:19:05,400
It feels like I did a thing with this 
guy,

3528
02:19:05,401 --> 02:19:08,640
Scott puppet curie.
He used to book the Mattapoisett in this

3529
02:19:08,641 --> 02:19:13,641
little tiny shithole,
but it was a great little room where I 

3530
02:19:13,641 --> 02:19:13,641
got to see Teddy Burger on.
By the way,

3531
02:19:13,680 --> 02:19:16,320
who was a fucking genius?
Yes.

3532
02:19:16,350 --> 02:19:21,350
One of the best comics ever.
One of the best comics ever had one of 

3533
02:19:21,350 --> 02:19:23,100
the best tonight show sets of all time.
Did you ever see us tonight?

3534
02:19:23,101 --> 02:19:25,780
Show sense.
It's fucking genius.

3535
02:19:26,130 --> 02:19:26,970
Another guy.
Were you.

3536
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:32,200
How could this guy not be in everybody's
mind as one of the greatest comics app 

3537
02:19:32,560 --> 02:19:35,210
and this Guy Scott peppertree booked a 
gig for.

3538
02:19:35,211 --> 02:19:40,211
He and I on block island and block 
island was an island outside of Rhode 

3539
02:19:40,211 --> 02:19:42,770
Island I think,
and there's nothing there.

3540
02:19:43,010 --> 02:19:48,010
It's just drunk,
retarded fishermen and they are dumb as 

3541
02:19:48,010 --> 02:19:49,190
fuck and they're so drunk.

3542
02:19:49,190 --> 02:19:52,010
They are all of them.
There's maybe 20 people in the room.

3543
02:19:52,160 --> 02:19:54,890
All of them are so drunk.
They can't even keep their eyes open.

3544
02:19:55,190 --> 02:20:00,190
Their mouths are slides in here and we 
have to do comedy for them and Scott 

3545
02:20:00,411 --> 02:20:03,470
gets up and starts shitting all over 
them and he was not really.

3546
02:20:03,860 --> 02:20:06,290
He hadn't been doing comedy that long 
then really probably shouldn't have been

3547
02:20:06,291 --> 02:20:08,240
on stage in this sort of situation 
anyway.

3548
02:20:08,450 --> 02:20:11,840
And I went on after him and they had 
already turned their backs to the comedy

3549
02:20:11,841 --> 02:20:12,800
show.
Like half of them.

3550
02:20:13,030 --> 02:20:18,030
They turned their backs and just started
a conversation and we had to stay in a 

3551
02:20:18,490 --> 02:20:20,090
wasn't.
It wasn't in a hotel room.

3552
02:20:20,120 --> 02:20:23,990
It was in a supply room.
They have two cots in a supply room with

3553
02:20:23,991 --> 02:20:26,850
no shower and there was a bathroom,
you know,

3554
02:20:26,851 --> 02:20:28,000
we could take like,
you know,

3555
02:20:28,170 --> 02:20:29,860
a,
a bath,

3556
02:20:30,270 --> 02:20:35,270
bath and you know,
we stayed in this little fucking supply 

3557
02:20:35,270 --> 02:20:35,270
room until we could catch the boat back 
then

3558
02:20:35,270 --> 02:20:36,850
stay.
Oh Man,

3559
02:20:37,660 --> 02:20:42,660
I did.
So many of those little more colleges 

3560
02:20:42,660 --> 02:20:43,150
were psyched.
I got a Gig.

3561
02:20:43,320 --> 02:20:44,750
I know at the time.
Yeah.

3562
02:20:44,751 --> 02:20:45,920
At the time you're like,
all right,

3563
02:20:45,921 --> 02:20:48,160
I get a Gig.
I'm making 50 bucks or whatever it was.

3564
02:20:48,190 --> 02:20:50,860
But oh man.
Brutal.

3565
02:20:50,950 --> 02:20:51,700
Bangor,
Maine.

3566
02:20:51,701 --> 02:20:53,050
I did a bunch up there.
Yeah,

3567
02:20:53,230 --> 02:20:58,230
I did a bunch for normally foe.
He had all these gigs in western 

3568
02:20:58,230 --> 02:21:01,531
Massachusetts were out there where you 
had to drive 40 miles an hour because 

3569
02:21:01,531 --> 02:21:02,680
deer would jump in front of your fucking
car every five minutes.

3570
02:21:02,890 --> 02:21:04,510
You had to be careful that you didn't 
die.

3571
02:21:04,720 --> 02:21:09,720
Like you get to these certain gates,
your shows and especially Western mass 

3572
02:21:09,720 --> 02:21:14,700
near Amherst.
I remember there was a lot of two lane 

3573
02:21:14,700 --> 02:21:14,700
roads where you would see dead deer all 
over the place.

3574
02:21:14,740 --> 02:21:17,600
Fucking wreck cars.
I nailed one one night.

3575
02:21:17,660 --> 02:21:18,190
Digital.
Yeah.

3576
02:21:18,191 --> 02:21:20,590
Yeah,
just as just as ass had just gotten past

3577
02:21:20,591 --> 02:21:21,880
me and I did the thing where I gunned 
it.

3578
02:21:21,940 --> 02:21:23,530
I'm like,
I want her to swerve,

3579
02:21:23,980 --> 02:21:28,980
but the voice was like,
come in and I fucking hit him and I 

3580
02:21:28,980 --> 02:21:30,220
watched him spin off into the woods.
Did you

3581
02:21:30,450 --> 02:21:32,640
die from that?
A lot of people have died from hitting.

3582
02:21:32,650 --> 02:21:34,770
Like especially if you hit a fucking 
moose.

3583
02:21:35,100 --> 02:21:36,090
If you hit a moose,
you,

3584
02:21:36,091 --> 02:21:39,960
you might be dead to the windshield and 
crush your fucking spine.

3585
02:21:40,770 --> 02:21:41,340
Yeah,
right.

3586
02:21:42,060 --> 02:21:44,530
I had a dream that might go.
Birth guy I work with in the UFC.

3587
02:21:44,550 --> 02:21:49,140
Got Killed by a grizzly bear and it was 
a very graphic movie in my head,

3588
02:21:49,141 --> 02:21:53,370
like a very graphic dream where it was 
very realistic and I woke up,

3589
02:21:53,371 --> 02:21:58,371
like literally woke up like Whoa.
Like he was with his wife and his kids 

3590
02:21:58,371 --> 02:22:02,481
and they were in a river and I'll 
fucking grizzly bear came running 

3591
02:22:02,481 --> 02:22:06,320
through the bank of the river,
jumped into the water and just fucked 

3592
02:22:06,320 --> 02:22:06,320
him up in front of everybody.
She says,

3593
02:22:06,330 --> 02:22:07,750
yeah,
very strange.

3594
02:22:07,890 --> 02:22:09,950
Microburst if you listen to but don't go

3595
02:22:10,640 --> 02:22:13,500
in the river,
stay the fuck away future of,

3596
02:22:13,520 --> 02:22:15,240
uh,
that's like 30 years from now,

3597
02:22:15,241 --> 02:22:20,241
that's what fucking sports going to be.
It's got to be literally be like a guy 

3598
02:22:20,241 --> 02:22:23,720
mixed martial arts verse,
some kind of Hybrid DNA government 

3599
02:22:23,720 --> 02:22:26,070
experiments like half fucking cougar.
The only reason why there's not

3600
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:29,220
sword fights on TV is because no one's 
put sword fights on TV.

3601
02:22:29,460 --> 02:22:31,320
If they were,
people would love to watch that.

3602
02:22:31,321 --> 02:22:34,140
Two guys with Samurai swords trying to 
hack each other's fucking head.

3603
02:22:34,160 --> 02:22:36,400
So I think we're going to produce our 
very first show together.

3604
02:22:37,550 --> 02:22:38,240
I love it.

3605
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:44,120
Versus the Christians.
I mean those people weren't much 

3606
02:22:44,120 --> 02:22:44,120
different than us today.
You know what I mean?

3607
02:22:44,120 --> 02:22:45,450
How is that different than ghetto 
gaggers.com?

3608
02:22:45,480 --> 02:22:47,700
How is that different than some of the 
shit that you watch?

3609
02:22:47,710 --> 02:22:51,210
Like those Mexican drug dealers cutting 
that guy's head off with a small knife.

3610
02:22:51,211 --> 02:22:56,211
Have you seen that video?
Fuck you see the suicide jump off off 

3611
02:22:56,211 --> 02:23:00,990
the fucking Uber has had.
It blows up like a coconut undergoes 

3612
02:23:02,370 --> 02:23:04,110
awful.
You can't unsee that stuff,

3613
02:23:04,111 --> 02:23:09,111
but you know that it's out there.
You know when you see someone really 

3614
02:23:09,111 --> 02:23:09,270
fucking shifty when you go to seven 
slash 11,

3615
02:23:09,271 --> 02:23:11,210
you should know this guy might pull out 
a gun,

3616
02:23:11,230 --> 02:23:13,710
might commit suicide.
The fuck knows.

3617
02:23:13,711 --> 02:23:14,430
I mean,
you know,

3618
02:23:14,460 --> 02:23:16,950
you've seen so much fucked up shit on 
the Internet.

3619
02:23:16,980 --> 02:23:21,980
I think to a certain extent it 
influences people's behavior and it 

3620
02:23:21,980 --> 02:23:25,461
makes people a little bit more fucked up
than maybe they could be because they 

3621
02:23:25,461 --> 02:23:25,461
have all this stuff.
They have access to this,

3622
02:23:25,461 --> 02:23:28,170
but on the other side you should be more
aware of what is possible.

3623
02:23:28,260 --> 02:23:30,600
You might be a good person who is always
around nice people.

3624
02:23:30,601 --> 02:23:35,601
You're a mormon or something,
and so you think everybody's a mellow 

3625
02:23:35,601 --> 02:23:38,271
and predictable and then all of a sudden
you're around some fucking gang banger 

3626
02:23:38,271 --> 02:23:38,520
and you don't know what the fuck this 
is.

3627
02:23:38,820 --> 02:23:43,820
You don't know what the rules are.
You don't know what's what game he's 

3628
02:23:43,820 --> 02:23:43,820
playing.

3629
02:23:43,820 --> 02:23:43,820
Yeah,
and you know what?

3630
02:23:43,820 --> 02:23:45,270
Most people don't realize in those 
situations,

3631
02:23:45,330 --> 02:23:50,330
you have no true.
You better fight your fucking ass off 

3632
02:23:50,330 --> 02:23:50,880
when you see people going along with it.
That's when you're like,

3633
02:23:50,910 --> 02:23:52,080
oh,
this is going to be bad.

3634
02:23:52,640 --> 02:23:54,530
I saw God get knocked out.
He was,

3635
02:23:54,531 --> 02:23:56,280
uh,
he looked like he just,

3636
02:23:56,310 --> 02:23:59,240
they just did these thugs.
Just found him coming out of a um,

3637
02:23:59,500 --> 02:24:01,790
it looked like a convenience store.
They knocked him out,

3638
02:24:01,820 --> 02:24:03,140
knocked him out,
unconscious.

3639
02:24:03,141 --> 02:24:05,600
The Guy Falls,
bangs his head off the concrete,

3640
02:24:05,630 --> 02:24:10,630
out cold,
arms are stiff and the dude starts 

3641
02:24:10,630 --> 02:24:11,300
pissing on his face.
He pulls a Dick and piss on it.

3642
02:24:11,350 --> 02:24:13,460
Just decided to knock this guy out of 
nowhere.

3643
02:24:13,580 --> 02:24:15,770
Like you need to know that there's 
people like that out there,

3644
02:24:15,980 --> 02:24:16,820
but that's real shit.
I mean,

3645
02:24:16,821 --> 02:24:18,860
you going to be paranoid and fucking,
you know,

3646
02:24:18,880 --> 02:24:21,510
and start dwelling on it and get all 
second amendment right.

3647
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:23,990
How do you get to know that person is 
they have a facebook page,

3648
02:24:23,991 --> 02:24:25,310
Hey,
I'm been knocking people out.

3649
02:24:26,750 --> 02:24:29,530
My wrap up is my tag tags.
I piss on you just,

3650
02:24:30,590 --> 02:24:32,300
it was hard to watch it on twitter.

3651
02:24:32,370 --> 02:24:37,370
It was hard to watch because you see the
half conscious and the pisses him and 

3652
02:24:37,370 --> 02:24:38,040
his face and just moving like that could
be you.

3653
02:24:38,100 --> 02:24:39,460
It could be anybody,
anybody knew,

3654
02:24:39,490 --> 02:24:41,790
somebody decides to steal on.
You're in the wrong place,

3655
02:24:41,791 --> 02:24:46,791
the wrong time,
and some guy who you never saw common 

3656
02:24:46,791 --> 02:24:47,970
decides to punch you in the face and 
Piss on your unconscious body.

3657
02:24:48,960 --> 02:24:50,220
And on that note,
ladies and gentlemen,

3658
02:24:50,790 --> 02:24:53,290
at the end of this fucking podcast,
I'm,

3659
02:24:53,291 --> 02:24:58,291
I'm glad you came over to again,
we're sponsored by the fleshlight 

3660
02:24:58,291 --> 02:24:58,291
fleshlight.com.
You know,

3661
02:24:58,291 --> 02:24:59,490
you and I have had our differences over 
the year,

3662
02:24:59,491 --> 02:24:59,980
but,
um,

3663
02:25:00,060 --> 02:25:01,200
I always,
uh,

3664
02:25:01,260 --> 02:25:03,090
respected your ability to market 
yourself.

3665
02:25:03,091 --> 02:25:08,091
And I always respected your ambition.
And I think sometimes when people are 

3666
02:25:08,091 --> 02:25:11,211
ambitious,
things don't necessarily work out the 

3667
02:25:11,211 --> 02:25:11,880
way they should be.
But I know you're a good dude and I know

3668
02:25:11,940 --> 02:25:12,920
that you,
uh,

3669
02:25:12,930 --> 02:25:15,300
you're always working on your act.
I see it all the time.

3670
02:25:15,301 --> 02:25:18,020
I know you're doing the right things and
I hear your interviews and I know you're

3671
02:25:18,030 --> 02:25:21,000
in a good place with your mind and I 
think that's important,

3672
02:25:21,001 --> 02:25:21,900
man.
And,

3673
02:25:21,901 --> 02:25:23,680
uh,
I think it's also important that,

3674
02:25:23,710 --> 02:25:25,630
you know,
at a certain stage in your life,

3675
02:25:25,631 --> 02:25:30,631
you know,
you have to recognize when you've had 

3676
02:25:30,631 --> 02:25:32,191
differences with somebody and you know,
it's not that I don't like you as a 

3677
02:25:32,191 --> 02:25:32,191
person,
you know,

3678
02:25:32,191 --> 02:25:34,040
just differences and I'm glad that we 
put all that shit past and

3679
02:25:34,590 --> 02:25:39,590
oh man,
that means the world here in that you 

3680
02:25:39,590 --> 02:25:42,080
get a lot of integrity and I've,
I've always had a lot of respect for 

3681
02:25:42,080 --> 02:25:44,451
her,
which is part of the reason that there 

3682
02:25:44,451 --> 02:25:44,670
was for me on my side when anybody ever 
came to me with anything.

3683
02:25:44,671 --> 02:25:48,390
It was like I have really nothing to say
about it and I hope that time will just,

3684
02:25:48,391 --> 02:25:49,950
uh,
eventually figure that out.

3685
02:25:49,951 --> 02:25:52,770
So I appreciate that.
Good to be here on your show.

3686
02:25:52,771 --> 02:25:53,310
We'll do it again.

3687
02:25:53,410 --> 02:25:53,980
Yeah,
dude,

3688
02:25:53,981 --> 02:25:54,850
for sure.
For sure.

3689
02:25:54,851 --> 02:25:55,670
And I think,
you know,

3690
02:25:55,690 --> 02:25:56,860
stuff like this,
like I said,

3691
02:25:56,861 --> 02:26:00,430
is perfect for a guy like you to.
So people really get a chance to see who

3692
02:26:00,431 --> 02:26:01,360
you really are.
True.

3693
02:26:01,390 --> 02:26:02,250
No bullshit.
No.

3694
02:26:02,410 --> 02:26:06,790
And I don't think anybody who was thrust
into your condition is going to come out

3695
02:26:06,791 --> 02:26:08,500
of it without some scrapes.
I mean you,

3696
02:26:08,501 --> 02:26:11,400
you thrust yourself into like really 
like a,

3697
02:26:11,660 --> 02:26:14,200
a,
a stratosphere like that.

3698
02:26:14,201 --> 02:26:18,130
Very few human beings ever have to 
navigate how many Lohan you did it.

3699
02:26:18,190 --> 02:26:23,190
Yeah.
You did it over a very short period of 

3700
02:26:23,190 --> 02:26:23,190
time.
So I think people need to respect that.

3701
02:26:23,190 --> 02:26:24,510
I think you did an awesome job.
Thanks.

3702
02:26:24,590 --> 02:26:26,290
I've got through it and you're doing all
the right shit.

3703
02:26:26,380 --> 02:26:28,720
And I enjoyed how you did that isolated 
incident.

3704
02:26:28,721 --> 02:26:33,400
I was telling people I love how you did 
it all in one take and all like with one

3705
02:26:33,401 --> 02:26:33,820
camera.

3706
02:26:33,820 --> 02:26:36,130
Like right on the stand.
You could tell there was no edits to it.

3707
02:26:36,390 --> 02:26:37,510
I was like,
that was really cool.

3708
02:26:37,511 --> 02:26:39,790
That was like a cool creative choice,
you know?

3709
02:26:40,150 --> 02:26:41,410
I think you're doing some awesome stuff.
Thanks.

3710
02:26:41,950 --> 02:26:43,570
Thank you.
I'm a good work.

3711
02:26:43,571 --> 02:26:45,990
Keep a good luck with your writing 
because to get that program by the way.

3712
02:26:46,020 --> 02:26:46,630
Yeah,
right.

3713
02:26:46,631 --> 02:26:49,150
Room folks who are.
I'm into it.

3714
02:26:49,151 --> 02:26:54,151
I think it only works for the Mac,
but I know that there's a version of it 

3715
02:26:54,151 --> 02:26:57,271
for the PC as well that does the exact 
same thing and it's just for all you 

3716
02:26:57,271 --> 02:26:58,430
creative types who are easily distracted
and uh,

3717
02:26:58,590 --> 02:27:01,760
if you're also easily distracted and you
have a hard time writing pickup.

3718
02:27:01,780 --> 02:27:06,780
This book called the war of art.
I think it's Steven Pressfield is a guy 

3719
02:27:06,780 --> 02:27:06,780
wrote,
you ever heard of it?

3720
02:27:06,780 --> 02:27:08,650
No,
fucking war of art.

3721
02:27:08,920 --> 02:27:11,230
I bought a bunch of them and I give them
out to people.

3722
02:27:11,390 --> 02:27:12,190
Um,
yeah,

3723
02:27:12,191 --> 02:27:13,510
I think I might have one.
I'll give one to you.

3724
02:27:13,570 --> 02:27:18,570
It's an amazing book and it's all about 
how you can overcome resistance and like

3725
02:27:18,750 --> 02:27:20,380
focus your mind for writing.
Really,

3726
02:27:20,381 --> 02:27:23,890
really brilliant book.
Everybody does it the book,

3727
02:27:24,050 --> 02:27:24,810
but he was,
you know,

3728
02:27:24,820 --> 02:27:26,470
he was talking,
he talks about it in the book.

3729
02:27:26,471 --> 02:27:31,471
I mean,
here's a guy who really didn't become 

3730
02:27:31,471 --> 02:27:33,781
successful as a writer until he was in 
his forties and he recognizes his own 

3731
02:27:33,781 --> 02:27:35,380
errors and what his own like bad 
patterns of thought and he,

3732
02:27:35,590 --> 02:27:38,410
he sort of addresses all of them that 
all creative type stuff.

3733
02:27:38,440 --> 02:27:39,460
And this thing.
Cool.

3734
02:27:40,150 --> 02:27:41,110
Anyway,
ladies and gentlemen,

3735
02:27:41,170 --> 02:27:46,170
