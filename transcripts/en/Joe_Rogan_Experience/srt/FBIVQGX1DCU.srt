1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:03,950
Um,

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,730
I got the interesting thing.

4
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:07,530
So daring me asking me what the last time,

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,460
I believe you,

6
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,420
you've got a pile of notes.

7
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,760
What is it about breathing?

8
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,250
What is it about breathing
or his breathing?

9
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:15,930
Just one component of this.

10
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:19,680
Is it breathing and also focusing
on what you're trying to accomplish?

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,041
Yeah,

12
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,660
focus absolutely works.

13
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,760
Let me explain a little about,

14
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:24,421
uh,

15
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:25,201
about breathing.

16
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:26,700
Breathing is chemistry.

17
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,530
Oxygen has chemistry in the body,

18
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,870
so if you all are able to,

19
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,470
uh,

20
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,670
Oksana dies,

21
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,860
the sells more than we do normally because
we talked about the lymphatic system

22
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:40,680
and the tissue and actually the,

23
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:40,930
uh,

24
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,930
the body's able to store up more oxygen
than the hundred percent we presumed,

25
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,920
uh,

26
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,310
possible is scientifically,

27
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,160
we are able to store up more oxygen.

28
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:55,050
So Ava breathing technique,

29
00:00:55,051 --> 00:01:00,051
whatever breathing technique is able
to store up more oxygen into cell,

30
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,130
that means going into the tissue,

31
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,780
going into the lymphatic system.

32
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,400
Then suddenly the,

33
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:06,181
Eh,

34
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:07,950
the chemistry becomes alkaline.

35
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,760
The acid gets out of the body
at will and then the mind,

36
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,420
the mind is positive,

37
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,700
a little electrical charges,

38
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,440
neurotransmitters and eh,

39
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,490
they are suddenly able to connect in
a buddy and you enabling you to have

40
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:30,450
control and direct all
the systems in the body.

41
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,520
That's the way nature manda to be.

42
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,960
So the mind,

43
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,350
a mind condition to be effective
in the body is making the body,

44
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:40,740
uh,

45
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,630
by breath,

46
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,660
right breathing profound
breathing in an alkaline state.

47
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,220
Then these electrical signals
are able to travel through.

48
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,070
And we,

49
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,070
the way nature meant it to be is that
we are able to direct any part of the

50
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:56,160
body.

51
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,660
So the immune system,

52
00:01:57,661 --> 00:01:58,890
endocrine system,

53
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,330
their lymphatic system,

54
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,980
vasculars older systems where
we told a little bit last time,

55
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,680
but I get more direct evidence now.

56
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,300
Um,

57
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:08,460
uh,

58
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,780
right now we are working with the
universities on the brain on say,

59
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,810
emotional reactivity and
they see incredible things
that we actually are able to

60
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:24,321
get into those places where
emotion exists and we take emotion,

61
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:25,891
where is it,

62
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:26,724
where is it?

63
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,760
But at this translated also as something
chemical so they can measure motion and

64
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:33,600
the chemical form.

65
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,080
Yes.

66
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,381
What are they,

67
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:35,214
what are they measuring?

68
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,390
And they,

69
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,390
they go into say a the hypothalamus,

70
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,400
hypothalamus,

71
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:42,270
hippocampus,

72
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,560
Amygdala.

73
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,560
Those are the places where this chemistry
is going on and we had no way to get

74
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,434
into that.

75
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:49,891
Now,

76
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:54,891
if you are able to ox energize those
parts and to pressurize with breathing

77
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:56,880
techniques into those parts,

78
00:02:56,881 --> 00:02:59,800
then suddenly you feel you begin cry.

79
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,121
Why?

80
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:02,860
Because the chemistry is changing.

81
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:07,990
You are dealing with a chemistry which
was stored up because he couldn't work it

82
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:11,230
out before and now you're
able to tap in there,

83
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,980
change the chemistry and
that that's the function.

84
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:15,661
Uh,

85
00:03:15,661 --> 00:03:18,250
you are not able to deal with it now.

86
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,920
So later when you have peace and you are,

87
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,380
uh,

88
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,360
somewhere,

89
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:23,710
no,

90
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,610
not stressful,

91
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,970
then work on it and breathing does it,

92
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,050
it eh,

93
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:29,480
Eh,

94
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,200
Eh,

95
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,740
Eh,

96
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,300
eh,

97
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,000
positively influences
the chemistry in the,

98
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:34,720
Eh,

99
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,860
in the depth of the brain.

100
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:36,401
You know,

101
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:37,240
what happens?

102
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:42,630
You create 25% more blood flow and
blood flow is with oxygen through three

103
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,000
breathing.

104
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,833
Yes.

105
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,110
Well it makes sense because
your blood is being,

106
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,440
it's carrying oxygen,

107
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,010
right?

108
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,730
So the more oxygen you provide your
blood and you are definitely providing it

109
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:56,110
more with these big long,

110
00:03:56,111 --> 00:04:00,040
deep breaths and these techniques
at you that you pursue.

111
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,550
Yes,

112
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,190
manipulating up the spine,

113
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,000
the central nervous system up
till the tunnel of the light.

114
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,770
The brainstem is at top.

115
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,670
So if you pressure rise
after act inhaling,

116
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,230
exhaling like we did last time you
did about three minutes almost uh,

117
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:17,861
without uh,

118
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:18,520
in the lungs.

119
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,353
Very good.

120
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:24,420
First round is very promising for the
next round because you get more and more

121
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,653
oxygen.

122
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,810
It only to show that you are able to
store a up oxygen far more than you ever

123
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:32,650
used before.

124
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,720
So in case when you need it to
regulate the chemistry inside the body,

125
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,460
then it needs oxygen.

126
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,000
Daniel,

127
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
we are all able with these breathing
exercises to get it anywhere where the

128
00:04:45,731 --> 00:04:50,050
chemistry is messed up and
a chemistry master APP,

129
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,490
we'll send off a signal but we are not
emotionally not listening because we got

130
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,430
a worries and we need to do
to deadline and this and that.

131
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,420
So we are not a,

132
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,040
and then there's chemistry
stays over there and,

133
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:09,310
and will deregulate the system and then
we become sick and we don't know what's

134
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:10,331
happening.

135
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:12,390
We go to the doctor and uh,

136
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:16,660
or the psychiatrist because we
could become depressed and all.

137
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,140
But I,

138
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,430
we are very able to get into any
place in the body and in this case,

139
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,600
the brain,

140
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,783
uh,

141
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,450
where,

142
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:27,700
uh,

143
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,120
and we do all the studies
now with the university.

144
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:35,130
They say cognitive therapy just talking
to each other in the psychology and

145
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,780
psychotherapy.

146
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,250
That's not enough.

147
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:44,490
That was a conference with 200 experts
and they did this breathing and then they

148
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:45,101
say,

149
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:45,281
oh,

150
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:46,120
wow,

151
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:47,501
yeah,

152
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:49,930
talking a only is not enough.

153
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,910
But if you do this breathing,

154
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,010
then you really get into the brain and
then suddenly you get a sense of control

155
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,780
because you're creating this
extra circulation of blood.

156
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,733
Yes,

157
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:01,160
Eh,

158
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,390
to get her with oxygen,

159
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,160
making it alkaline.

160
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:09,460
Then suddenly the blockage is created
because of Ron chemistry because of trauma

161
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:10,880
or,

162
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,770
uh,

163
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,450
anxiety or grief.

164
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,570
Then suddenly a,

165
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:20,480
that chemistry is being dealt
with and you get balanced.

166
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,250
[inaudible] simple.

167
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,020
And we keep it simple,

168
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:24,501
uh,

169
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:25,520
and,

170
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:25,891
and,

171
00:06:25,891 --> 00:06:28,970
and try to get this web of our thoughts.

172
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:32,330
Thinking of so many
difficulties and complications,

173
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,690
what is emotion?

174
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,431
What is fair?

175
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:35,630
What is PTSD?

176
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,680
What is trauma?

177
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:37,670
What is depression?

178
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,860
We don't know where it is in the brain.

179
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,980
Just get older brain full of oxygen,

180
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:48,530
get to alkalinity up and you are able
to steer by going through the spine,

181
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,250
up in your head and do it all.

182
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,930
Is that why sit do you believe,

183
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:57,260
is that why some studies have
shown that rigorous exercise,

184
00:06:57,261 --> 00:07:00,230
particularly cardio like
running a elliptical machines,

185
00:07:00,231 --> 00:07:05,060
things along those lines are just as
good for depression as medication?

186
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,070
Absolutely.

187
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,621
Absolutely.

188
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:06,761
Yeah.

189
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:07,580
It,

190
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,580
it's dealing with the oxygen tension
forcing when you think those giant deep

191
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:14,840
breaths you take when you're jogging or,

192
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,490
yes.

193
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:15,900
Yes,

194
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,530
I do.

195
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,240
Uh,

196
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,040
when you do though,

197
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,351
staying,

198
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:18,521
see,

199
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:23,521
you actually create a dead body
to be effective with the oxygen,

200
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,800
then subtly different
mechanisms are at work,

201
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,580
Eh,

202
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,470
more oxygen is coming in and
the chemistry is balancing out.

203
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,300
A depression is caused by a,

204
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,670
a wrong chemistry,

205
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,590
creating inflammation.

206
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,250
I,

207
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:40,611
you know,

208
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:42,140
I'm a regular exerciser,

209
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,003
but sometimes,

210
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,000
yeah.
