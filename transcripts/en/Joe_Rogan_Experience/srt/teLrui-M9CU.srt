1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,370
The general experience,
and that's really what I'm doing at a

2
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:08,050
level that you can start in bed,
right?

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,980
So there's no more fucking excuses,
fucking excuses,

4
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:15,060
and that's so important because people
can feel sorry for themselves.

5
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:18,450
They can say they can't do it.
They don't have the energy there to beat

6
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:19,650
up.
That's bullshit.

7
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:22,510
There's always something you can do as
always if you.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,750
But if you give yourself that fucking
excuse,

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,080
that's the problem.
What?

10
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,280
What I love about that video is if
anybody had an excuse,

11
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:31,190
it's that guy,
that guy,

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,140
I mean two canes,
giant belly blown out,

13
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:38,460
knees blown out,
back veteran paratrooper,

14
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,950
guide guide me,
jumping out of fucking airplanes over

15
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:43,620
and over again.
Blows his body apart and you fixed it

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,630
and he fixed it.
Fixed.

17
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,770
I just literally like credit.
So would I send them the food plant

18
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,550
right from,
from,

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,480
from Fred [inaudible],
his dream,

20
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,180
the food plan because it just regular
food.

21
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,460
But like what do you have the meeting
like chicken,

22
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,291
steak,
let's,

23
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,070
let's,
let's finish her.

24
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,710
So people's,
you'll hear me say in my program over

25
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:06,570
and over and over and over and over
again.

26
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,040
Make the DDP why your own bike.
And I explained to Arthur when I called

27
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,180
him.
Well here's what happened.

28
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:13,620
So he,
um,

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,020
he,
I sent him the food plan.

30
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:19,050
Let me say it.
And if he writes me back I think I can

31
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:21,030
do it.
I'll give it a try.

32
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,283
You go crazy.
No,

33
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,100
I go,
hey,

34
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,210
awesome.
Keep me posted.

35
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,420
But he said four words or he wrote for
words.

36
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,100
I can do this.
I said,

37
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:32,070
give me your number right now.
And I call the motherfucker up.

38
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,020
If you say you can use,
say you can't,

39
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:36,630
you're right.
You know that say you can't or you say

40
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:37,510
you can't.
You're right.

41
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,800
You said that originally who Henry Ford
was,

42
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:41,150
right?

43
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,060
Yeah.
And I always say,

44
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,890
what the fuck did he ever do?
What the fuck did he ever do?

45
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,980
But for when he said I can do it,
I said,

46
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:52,410
give me your number.
So I called them and I said,

47
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:53,940
Yo,
we talked for about an hour.

48
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,490
Two weeks later he calls me back.
The main thing I talked to him in in in

49
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:03,210
that conversation,
which is again what positively on stop

50
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,120
was all about as important as the
workout is,

51
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,680
as important as the eating plan is 10
percent of the equation.

52
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,890
The 90 percent is right between your
ears right here,

53
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:16,980
that six inch piece of real estate,
the story you tell yourself,

54
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,580
and I said,
if you can really just get past that

55
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:24,750
story and start
telling yourself a different story,

56
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,140
and example would be when I had,
when I went from my hall of fame

57
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,940
Induction Speech in front of 20,000
people in millions of people on USA and

58
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:35,520
on the wwe network,
which is only nine 99.

59
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,500
By the way,
it's like a rib bottom line is,

60
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:44,160
is that I wasn't in the back going,
Oh God,

61
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:45,780
I hope I don't fuck this up.
Oh God,

62
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:47,670
what if I forget what was going to say,
Oh God,

63
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:48,860
this sucks.
What if I.

64
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,460
What if I fuck up?
I wouldn't say.

65
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,080
Now I'm saying this can be the best
thing ever done.

66
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,790
I'm going to blow people away and make
them laugh.

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,310
Make them cry.
I'm going to inspire them and that was

68
00:02:56,311 --> 00:02:57,600
my inner voice.
I went out there,

69
00:02:57,601 --> 00:03:01,780
did the best thing I've ever done.
It's the best thing I've ever done,

70
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:06,760
but it's about that story that you tell
yourself when you get all this shit and

71
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:09,450
that's why people listen to you because
they want.

72
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,030
They need to be reminded it over and
over and over again.

73
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:15,370
You know,
the way you think about things is so

74
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,020
important.
It's so important.

75
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:18,910
It's almost more important than the
facts,

76
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,840
right?
The Way and the way this guy decided

77
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:26,240
that he was going to change his life,
that that video is so important to

78
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:26,681
people.
I mean,

79
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:29,260
if there's ever.
That's the best testimonial video you're

80
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:30,094
ever going to say.

81
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,250
I'm running boldly with an l by my name,
right?

82
00:03:32,251 --> 00:03:35,040
So I'm trying to change the brand so
it's a decent brand is what I'm doing.

83
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,480
Or you put libertarian,
all my stuff.

84
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,740
I'm almost libertarian so I'm trying to
build the brand out to be a better

85
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:43,980
brand.
So if I win the brands better,

86
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,630
people will do that,
will raise my money,

87
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,070
there'll be a real third party.
I mean,

88
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:49,800
there'll be a third party in the United
States which will make better Democrats

89
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:52,230
and Republicans will literally be a
better nation,

90
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:57,030
a better a politic will be better in
America if I actually win this damn

91
00:03:57,031 --> 00:03:59,280
thing,
but let's say I lose Sam wrong.

92
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,610
My things,
my mind isn't wrong.

93
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:01,830
Whatever people don't agree,
I lose.

94
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,730
Doesn't matter.
The bold ideas are still out there.

95
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,790
What you heard,
what your audience hurt is still there.

96
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,930
Someone's going to pick this up,
some of us,

97
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,380
or talk about it,
and if you're fine with that 100

98
00:04:13,381 --> 00:04:15,030
percent,
what?

99
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,020
Yes,
please.

100
00:04:16,021 --> 00:04:20,430
I want to fix things I'm not concerned
with who gets the credit for it.

101
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,640
Let's fix it.
I'm going to a better place to live this

102
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:24,860
cutters in trouble.
Nielsen.

103
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,070
Here's the perfect example of,
of,

104
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,380
of where we're going.
I don't want that to be the rest of this

105
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:29,850
nation.
We can fix,

106
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,550
steal all my stuff.
Please steal it all.

107
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,840
Awesome.
I hope you steal it.

108
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:36,900
I hope California copies me and does
everything I said it'd be amazing.

109
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,160
Please do that.
It'd be awesome,

110
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,160
but if people don't hear me,
if I don't get out there,

111
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:43,530
if I don't have to debate stage and I
don't come in second or third,

112
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,780
then no one's going to hear me because
I'm going to be forgotten,

113
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,950
but if I come in second or tight third,
there'll be a microphone in my face for

114
00:04:49,951 --> 00:04:53,670
the next two years and every time it's
out there I'll be saying stuff just like

115
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:58,410
this again and again and again and maybe
manage a system isn't perfect,

116
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,450
but guess what?
Someone will figure out the right one.

117
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,370
It won't be.
Just keep giving it money.

118
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,250
It won't be that.
It'll be something that'll actually

119
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:07,830
work.
It'd be something brand new and exciting

120
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,390
and get people to come back to our
state.

121
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,720
What I don't want is what's happening
now is kids get educated,

122
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,180
they leave.
They don't come back with the educators

123
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,890
someplace else and never come back.

124
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,360
It's the wrong answer.
I'm really into craftsmanship,

125
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,680
man.
I always have been.

126
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:25,710
I love handmade pool cues and this desk,
which is handmade desk and I feel like

127
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:31,270
it's one of the things that I really
appreciate in this modern digital world.

128
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,010
And I also feel like unfortunately it
may be one of the things that slipping

129
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:36,844
away.

130
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,490
It definitely is slipping away.
I think with um,

131
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,100
you know,
with technology,

132
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,920
technology has been great for us and a
lot of different ways.

133
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:49,000
Like we couldn't be fucking talking into
a piece of metal and it's recorded on

134
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:51,360
the computer going through a wire flying
to the air.

135
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:54,610
Like it does a lot of great things.
But in doing all those great things,

136
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,640
it actually has taken us away from
really creating and working with our

137
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:02,360
hands.
And so like,

138
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,170
you know,
even this whole like a farm to table

139
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:08,330
movement where people even growing their
own vegetables,

140
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,040
you got your own chickens,
they're,

141
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,190
they're laying eggs for you.
Like knowing where this stuff is coming

142
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:16,130
from.
Having firsthand contact with that.

143
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,490
I'm just having that relationship in
general with.

144
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:24,440
It brings so much more value to the
overall experience of eating those eggs

145
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:27,830
are using that knife or sitting at this
fucking table right here

146
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:32,050
and it seems like a fairly recent
movement in that direction.

147
00:06:32,051 --> 00:06:34,840
Right?
Like it feels like things got so digital

148
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:35,750
that people like,
whoa,

149
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:36,551
Whoa,
whoa.

150
00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:39,800
What the facebook and the fucking
instagram I want to.

151
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:43,890
I want a wood table.
I want to solve this myself.

152
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,860
Yeah.
Your hands on it.

153
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,700
Yeah.
I don't want it to be plastic.

154
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,880
Yeah.
I want real stuff.

155
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,060
And there's something about handmade
things,

156
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:56,020
whether it's a handmade pair of boots or
handmade bag.

157
00:06:56,021 --> 00:06:59,860
Like it's like there's something about
things that are made by hand that people

158
00:06:59,861 --> 00:07:01,380
get like a deep appreciation of.

159
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,470
For sure.
For sure.

160
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,770
Well,
and I think it,

161
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,850
I think it also kind of goes back,
like I was saying,

162
00:07:06,851 --> 00:07:11,140
like as technology has advanced,
we've kind of grown away from these

163
00:07:11,141 --> 00:07:14,650
kinds of what's considered like blue
collar work and craftsmanship kind of

164
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:18,370
work,
but I think people really are driven by

165
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:23,200
a sense of achievement and when you're
doing data entry that literally millions

166
00:07:23,201 --> 00:07:25,600
of people fucking monkeys can be trained
to do.

167
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:29,020
Not to like diminish anything that
anybody's doing but literally like

168
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,740
to be able to go into a craft and to and
had a hands on experience is very,

169
00:07:36,491 --> 00:07:37,061
very,
very,

170
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:38,680
very different in that sense of
achievement.

171
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,430
Even when somebody comes out of
something and maybe I taught a class on

172
00:07:42,431 --> 00:07:44,320
how to make a knife and it looks like a
fucking Turd,

173
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,140
they're going to think it looks like the
most beautiful fucking knife they've

174
00:07:47,141 --> 00:07:50,610
ever seen in their life because their
hands and their creative,

175
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,890
they touch their energy,
their,

176
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,740
their sweat and pop.
Probably some of their blood is put into

177
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:59,500
creating that thing and that brings that
much more value to it.

178
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,710
Like,
like I was,

179
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,320
like I was saying earlier,
you can get kids to believe in anything

180
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:04,430
he could bring.
I could,

181
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,070
I could get my son into Satan
essentially.

182
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,350
He'd be all in all about Lucifer.
Boom.

183
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,720
I got them into the brown kids.
Little Kids,

184
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,070
you know?
Yeah,

185
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,800
totally.
He's,

186
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,680
he's so into the dodgers because his
grandpa is under the daughter,

187
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:22,890
so he's all about the dodgers and I got
him into the browns is all in the browns

188
00:08:22,891 --> 00:08:25,220
now too because I could get them into
anything.

189
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,940
So I sat him down and I say,
you are going to sit you down and I'm

190
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:32,960
going to show you the master of the
nunchucks and it's Bruce Lee.

191
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,160
He's number one.

192
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,910
He's,
he's the greatest martial artist of all

193
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:44,810
time.
I broke them and I sat him down and put

194
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:47,390
them in front of the TV to that.
Should have filmed this.

195
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,310
Did you fill the whole thing?
You filmed,

196
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:50,540
you saying it to him?
No,

197
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,070
I didn't film that,
but I filmed it.

198
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:57,280
I filmed him watching Bruce Lee.
I'm a first.

199
00:08:57,481 --> 00:09:01,020
I showed him the greatest nunchucks
scenes of all time with Bruce Lee that

200
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:02,560
you can go to youtube and you can see
there's,

201
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,540
there's compilations.
They put together the one from the stuff

202
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,610
in,
enter the dragon,

203
00:09:07,611 --> 00:09:12,611
this stuff in a Chinese connection,
a way of the dragon or or return of the

204
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,080
dragon and a.
So I sat them down and go,

205
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,260
I'm going to blitz them with this shit.
I'm going to make sure that whenever he

206
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:23,130
thinks about fucking nunchucks he knows
that Bruce Lee's the master.

207
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,320
Right?
So he's just completely blown away.

208
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:27,800
Then after I showed them other nunchucks
scenes with,

209
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,110
I sat them down and I want them to show
them the greatest fights of all time.

210
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,590
Bruce Lee versus Chuck fucking Norris.
Come on man.

211
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,090
So I just want her to leave that just in
his DNA and I fill in that.

212
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:42,180
I filmed him watching a chuck Norris and
Bruce Lee.

213
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,990
Any old always wants to know he.
He loves.

214
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,630
He loves Bruce Lee instantly,
and he,

215
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,880
he,
he needs to know who wins the fight.

216
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,610
So like daddy does.
Bruce Lee.

217
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,600
When I go always when sunny always wins
and,

218
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,490
but my natural reaction,
because he's constantly asking

219
00:09:59,491 --> 00:10:00,810
questions,
he's constantly does he,

220
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,120
when my natural reaction would be just
watch,

221
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:04,920
watch you gotta,
watch this because it's going to be

222
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:07,920
sweeter if you watch it and you go
through the ups and downs and he goes,

223
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:08,460
no data.

224
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,290
You need to tell me now.
And I go,

225
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,910
no,
you're gonna like it more if you just

226
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,070
watch it.
You got no daddy does.

227
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:19,071
Bruce Lee when he wants to fucking know
he don't want to be disappointed.

228
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,060
Yeah.
So he got two years old.

229
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,560
Yeah.
He got completely blown away.

230
00:10:22,561 --> 00:10:26,640
So a week later,
a week later I got today you're going to

231
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:29,430
watch the greatest martial arts movie of
all time.

232
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,920
Enter the Dragon.
Bruce Lee.

233
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:32,783
Dad,
isn't it?

234
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:33,870
I go,
yes.

235
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:37,200
It's the real main chimpanzee.
Yeah.

236
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:38,250
That was gonna be like,
so if there's anything.

237
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:39,420
I was like,
holy cow.

238
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,130
What movie was that?
It looked really cool.

239
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,320
Chimpanzee,
who is it?

240
00:10:42,321 --> 00:10:43,770
A documentary?
Yeah.

241
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,240
Yeah.
It's kind of like a documentary.

242
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:46,730
I was like,
damn,

243
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,280
I'm sure.
I mean,

244
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,530
they're mean.
They're cruel.

245
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:51,710
They,
they're,

246
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,290
they're calculated.
Yeah.

247
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,860
Yeah.
They sneak up on each other and like,

248
00:10:55,861 --> 00:10:58,660
I didn't realize chimps did calculator.
Cruelty.

249
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,550
Yeah.
How's pretty

250
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,630
left that meeting?
Kind of like game over.

251
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,110
This is dark,
right?

252
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:06,970
Well,
we know better because we've advanced,

253
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,790
but if we hadn't,
we'd be like,

254
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,590
man,
I don't want to fucking live in a house.

255
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,030
I like the champ ways,
bro.

256
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,610
Chimp ways to go.
This is it man.

257
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,730
Chimp life right now,
but we in a way to the AI might be like,

258
00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:27,220
those chimps were like these stupid Fox
launching missiles out of drones and

259
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,130
shooting each other underwater.
Like we're crazy.

260
00:11:30,131 --> 00:11:34,690
We got torpedoes,
submarines and fucking airplanes that

261
00:11:34,691 --> 00:11:38,110
drop nuclear bombs.
Indiscriminantly on cities were assholes

262
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,170
too.
Yeah.

263
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,600
They might go,
why are they doing this?

264
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:48,100
It might look at our politics.
Look at what we do in terms of our,

265
00:11:48,101 --> 00:11:49,510
our,
our food system.

266
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,010
What,
what kind of food?

267
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,980
We forced down each other's and they
might

268
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,110
go this,
these people crazy.

269
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,410
Didn't even look out for themselves.
I don't know.

270
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:00,100
How much do we think about chimps?
Not much.

271
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:03,790
Very little.
It's like these chimps are at war that

272
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:08,740
these like little
groups of chimps just attack each other

273
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,860
and they kill each other.
They torture each other.

274
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:16,861
That's pretty bad.
The monkees a there,

275
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:22,600
but like this is probably the most.
But you know,

276
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,980
I mean when's the last time you talked
about trips with me?

277
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,910
All the time.
If you do talk to the podcast,

278
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,140
dude that's talking about chimps
episode,

279
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,610
people are laughing right now.
