1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,370
The joe rogan experience.
And that's really what I'm doing at a

2
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:07,950
level that you can start in bed,
right?

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,960
So there's no more fucking,
excuse me,

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,160
fucking excuses.
And that's so tam important and it

5
00:00:13,161 --> 00:00:15,060
gives,
people can feel sorry for themselves.

6
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:18,450
They can say they can't do it.
They don't have the energy there to beat

7
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:19,650
up.
That's bullshit.

8
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:22,530
There's always something you can do.
That's always something if you,

9
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:24,750
but if you give yourself that fucking
excuse,

10
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,870
that's the problem.
What I love about that video is if

11
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:29,940
anybody had an excuse,
it's that guy.

12
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,490
Absolutely that guy,
I mean two canes,

13
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,330
giant belly blown out,
knees blown out,

14
00:00:35,331 --> 00:00:40,260
back veteran paratrooper,
guide guide me jumping out of fucking

15
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:43,620
airplanes over and over again.
Blows his body apart and you fixed it.

16
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,750
That and he fixed it.
He fixed,

17
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,770
I just literally like credible.
So what I sent him the food plant right

18
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:52,650
from,
from,

19
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,880
from Fred Bucci is the ice cream,
the food plan because it's just regular

20
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:57,180
food.

21
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,460
But like what do you have the meeting
like chicken,

22
00:00:59,461 --> 00:01:00,300
steak.
Let's,

23
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,143
let's,
let's finish your,

24
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,240
so you'll hear me say in my program over
and over and over and over and over

25
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:07,470
again.
Make the DDP,

26
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:11,040
why your own bike.
And I explained to Arthur when I called

27
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,180
him.
Well here's what happened.

28
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:16,020
So He um,
[inaudible] I sent him the food plan.

29
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,360
Let me just say,
and if he writes me back,

30
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,120
I think I can do it.
I'll give it a try.

31
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,290
You go crazy.
No,

32
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,100
I go,
hey,

33
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,210
awesome.
Keep me posted.

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,420
But he said four words or he wrote four
words.

35
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,130
I can do this.
I said,

36
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:32,070
give me your number right now.
And I called them on the fucker up.

37
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,020
If you say you can,
you say you can't,

38
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:36,640
you're right.
You know that you say you can or you say

39
00:01:36,641 --> 00:01:37,500
you camp,
you're right.

40
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,210
Right.
Do you know said that originally who

41
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,100
Henry Ford is,
right?

42
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,060
Yeah.
And I always say,

43
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,280
what the fuck did he ever do?
You know,

44
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,050
what the fuck did he ever do?
But for when he said,

45
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:49,980
I can do it,
I said,

46
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:52,410
give me your number.
So I called them and I said,

47
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,940
Yo,
we talked for about an hour.

48
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,740
Two weeks later he calls me back.
The main thing I talked to him in in,

49
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,980
in that conversation,
which is again what positively going to

50
00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:07,980
stop the war is all about as important
as the workout is as important as the

51
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:12,981
eating plan is 10% of the equation.
The 90% is right between your ears right

52
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:15,390
here,
that six inch piece of real estate,

53
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,540
the story you tell yourself and I said,
if you can really just get past that

54
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:24,750
story and start re telling yourself a
different story.

55
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,140
An example would be when I had,
when I went from my whole theme

56
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,940
induction speech in front of 20,000
people in millions of people on USA and

57
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:35,950
on the wwe network,
which is only nine 99 about a wife.

58
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,900
It's like a ribbed bottom line is,
is that I wasn't in the back going,

59
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,330
Oh God,
I hope I don't fuck this up.

60
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,040
Oh God,
what if I forget what was going to say?

61
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,390
Oh God,
this sucks.

62
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,950
When,
what if like what if I fuck up?

63
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,420
I wouldn't say.
Now I'm saying it's going to be best

64
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,460
thing I've ever done.
I'm going to blow people away and make

65
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:54,420
them laugh,
make them cry.

66
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:57,120
I'm going to inspire them.
And that was my inner voice.

67
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,100
I went out there,
did the best thing I've ever done,

68
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,110
like it's the best thing I've ever done.
But it's about that story that you tell

69
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:08,440
yourself when you get all this shit.
And that's why people listen to you

70
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,340
because they want,
they need to be reminded over and over

71
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:13,390
and over again.
You know,

72
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,090
the way you think about things is so
important.

73
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,340
It's so important.
It's almost more important than the

74
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:19,370
facts,
right?

75
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,310
The Way and the way this guy decided
that he was going to change his life,

76
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,470
that that video is so important to
people.

77
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:27,310
I mean,
if there's ever,

78
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,830
that's the best testimonial video you
ever going to say?

79
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,250
I'm running boldly with an l by my name,
right?

80
00:03:32,251 --> 00:03:34,440
So I'm trying to change the Brian.
So it's a decent brand.

81
00:03:34,441 --> 00:03:36,510
It's what I'm doing.
Are you putting the button on my stuff?

82
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,580
I'm always libertarian.
So I'm trying to,

83
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,190
to build the brand out to be a better
brand.

84
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,820
So if I win the brands better people,
we'll do that.

85
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:46,770
We'll raise my money.
There'll be a real third party.

86
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,690
I mean,
there'll be a third party in the United

87
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,360
States which will make better democrats
and better republicans will literally be

88
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:52,560
a better nation,
a better,

89
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,340
uh,
a politic we better in in America if I

90
00:03:56,341 --> 00:03:59,280
actually win this damn thing.
But let's say I lose Sam wrong.

91
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,100
My things in my mind is a wrong whatever
people want,

92
00:04:01,101 --> 00:04:01,934
great.
I lose.

93
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,730
Doesn't matter.
The bold ideas are still out there.

94
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,760
What you heard,
what your audience heard is still there.

95
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,670
Someone's going to pick this up.
Some wasn't a talk about it.

96
00:04:11,671 --> 00:04:15,030
And if you're fine with that,
100% what?

97
00:04:15,031 --> 00:04:16,020
Yes,
please.

98
00:04:16,021 --> 00:04:20,430
I want to fix things I'm not concerned
with who gets the credit for it.

99
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,160
Let's fix it.
I want a better place to live.

100
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,080
This cutters in trouble.
Nielsen is the perfect example of,

101
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,380
of where we're going.
I don't want that to be the rest of this

102
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:29,880
nation.
We can fix,

103
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,960
steal.
All my stuff.

104
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:33,090
Please steal it all.
Awesome.

105
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,790
I hope you steal it.
I hope California copies me and does

106
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,590
everything I said it'd be amazing.
Please do that.

107
00:04:37,591 --> 00:04:39,930
It'd be awesome,
but if people don't hear me,

108
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,510
if I don't get out there,
if I don't even debate stage and I don't

109
00:04:42,511 --> 00:04:44,950
come in second or third,
then no one's going to hear me because

110
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,300
I'm going to be forgotten.
But if I come in second or tight third,

111
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,720
there'll be a microphone in my face for
the next two years and every time it's

112
00:04:51,721 --> 00:04:56,721
out there I'll be saying stuff just like
this again and again and again and maybe

113
00:04:57,241 --> 00:04:59,310
my education system isn't perfect,
but guess what?

114
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,400
Someone will figure out the right one.
It won't be just keep giving it money.

115
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,250
It won't be that.
It'll be something that'll actually

116
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:07,830
work.
It'd be something brand new and exciting

117
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,420
and get people to come back to our
state.

118
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,750
What I don't want is what's happening
now is kids get educated,

119
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,040
they leave,
they don't come back with the edge,

120
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,890
get someplace else and never come back.

121
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,570
It's the wrong answer.
I'm really into crafts from shit man.

122
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:24,660
I always have been.
I love handmade pool cues and this desk,

123
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:28,780
which is a handmade desk and I feel like
it's one of the things that I really

124
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:33,781
appreciate in this modern digital world.
And I also feel like unfortunately it

125
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,460
may be one of the things that slipping
away.

126
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,130
It definitely is slipping away.
I think with,

127
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,420
um,
you know,

128
00:05:41,421 --> 00:05:44,030
with technology,
technology has been great for us and a

129
00:05:44,031 --> 00:05:46,990
lot of different ways.
Like we couldn't be fucking talking into

130
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,870
a piece of metal and it's recorded on
the computer going through a wire flying

131
00:05:50,871 --> 00:05:52,700
through the air.
Like it does a lot of great things.

132
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:57,701
But in doing all those great things,
it actually has taken us away from

133
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,830
really creating and working with our
hands.

134
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:03,260
And so like,
you know,

135
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,550
even this whole like a farm to table
movement where people even growing their

136
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:09,680
own vegetables,
you've got your own chickens,

137
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,120
they're,
they're laying eggs for you.

138
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,400
Like knowing where this stuff is coming
from,

139
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:17,240
having like firsthand contact with that.
Um,

140
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:22,010
just having that relationship in general
with it brings so much more value to the

141
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:26,780
overall experience of eating those eggs
are using that knife or sitting at this

142
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:27,830
fucking table right here

143
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:32,050
and it seems like a fairly recent
movement in that direction.

144
00:06:32,051 --> 00:06:34,840
Right?
Like it feels like things got so digital

145
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:35,710
that people are like,
whoa,

146
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:36,550
Whoa,
whoa.

147
00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:40,050
What the facebook and the fucking
instagram I want to I I,

148
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:41,830
you know,
I want a wood table.

149
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,870
Yeah.
I want to saw this bitch myself.

150
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,860
Yeah.
Your hands on it.

151
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,670
Yeah.
I don't want it to be fantastic.

152
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,910
Yeah.
I want real stuff.

153
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,060
And there's something about handmade
things,

154
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:56,640
whether it's a handmade pair of boots
are handmade bag like this.

155
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,220
Like there's something about things that
are made by hand that people get at like

156
00:07:00,221 --> 00:07:01,380
a deep appreciation of,

157
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,470
for sure.
For sure.

158
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,860
Well,
and I think it,

159
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,850
I think it also kind of goes back,
like I was saying,

160
00:07:06,851 --> 00:07:11,350
like as technology has advanced,
we've kind of grown away from these kind

161
00:07:11,351 --> 00:07:14,920
of what's considered like blue collar
work and craftsmanship kind of work.

162
00:07:14,921 --> 00:07:19,921
But I think people really are driven by
a sense of achievement and when you're

163
00:07:20,771 --> 00:07:25,270
doing data entry that literally millions
of people fucking monkeys can be trained

164
00:07:25,271 --> 00:07:27,220
to do.
Not to like diminish anything that

165
00:07:27,221 --> 00:07:29,020
anybody's doing,
but literally like

166
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:35,970
to be able to go into a craft and to and
had a hands on experience is very,

167
00:07:36,491 --> 00:07:37,061
very,
very,

168
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:38,680
very different in that sense of
achievement.

169
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,430
Even when somebody comes out of
something and maybe I taught a class on

170
00:07:42,431 --> 00:07:44,320
how to make a knife and it looks like a
fucking Turd,

171
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,140
they're going to think it looks like the
most beautiful fucking knife they've

172
00:07:47,141 --> 00:07:51,550
ever seen in their life because their
hands and their creativity touched their

173
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,990
energy,
their,

174
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,740
their sweat and pop.
Probably some of their blood is put into

175
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:59,500
creating that thing and that brings that
much more value to it.

176
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,710
Like,
like I was,

177
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,990
like I was saying earlier,
you could get kids to believe in

178
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:03,860
anything.
You get brain.

179
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,060
I could,
I could get my son into Satan easily.

180
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,380
He'd be all in all about Lucifer.
Boom.

181
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,100
I got them into the Brown kids,
you know?

182
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,420
Yeah,
totally.

183
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,700
He's so into the dodgers because his
grandpa isn't at the dodgers,

184
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:22,070
so he's all about the dodgers.
And I got them into the browns.

185
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:25,210
He's all in the browns now too,
because I could get them into anything.

186
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,080
So I sat them down and I say,
you are,

187
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:31,910
I'm going to sit you down and I'm going
to show you the master of the nunchucks.

188
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,400
And it's Bruce Lee.
He's number one dude.

189
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,910
He's the guy.
He's the greatest martial artist of all

190
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:44,810
time.
I broke them and I sat him down and put

191
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:47,420
them in front of the TV to,
they should have filmed this.

192
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,150
I did you fill the whole thing?
You filmed you saying it to him?

193
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,290
No,
I didn't film that,

194
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,890
but I filmed,
I filmed him watching Bruce Lee.

195
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,700
Um,
uh,

196
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,050
first I showed him the greatest nunchuck
scenes of all time with Bruce Lee that

197
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:02,540
you can go to youtube and you can get
there.

198
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,550
There's compilations.
They put together the one from the stuff

199
00:09:06,551 --> 00:09:09,810
in end of the drag and the stuff in a
Chinese connection,

200
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,983
uh,
uh,

201
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,590
a way of the dragon or return of the
Dragon.

202
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,671
And,
uh,

203
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:17,370
so I sat him down and go,
I'm going to blitz them with this shit.

204
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:21,090
I'm going to make sure that whenever he
thinks about fucking nun chucks,

205
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,340
he knows that Bruce Lee's the master.
Right?

206
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,670
So he's just completely blown away.
Then after I showed him all the

207
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:29,490
nunchucks scenes with,
I sat him down and I want to show him

208
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:31,110
the greatest fights of all time.

209
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,580
Bruce Lee versus Chuck fucking norris
come on that.

210
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,090
So I just wanted to leave that just in
his DNA and I fell on that.

211
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:42,180
I filmed him watching a chuck Norris and
Bruce Lee,

212
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,990
and he always wants to know he,
he loves,

213
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,960
he loves Bruce Lee instantly and he,
he,

214
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,800
he needs to know who wins the fight.
So if I,

215
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:52,980
daddy does Bruce Lee,
when I go,

216
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,980
he always wins.
Sunny always wins.

217
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,690
And,
but my natural reaction,

218
00:09:57,691 --> 00:09:59,970
cause he,
he's constantly asking questions.

219
00:09:59,971 --> 00:10:01,090
He's constantly,
does he win?

220
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,650
My natural reaction would be just watch,
watch you gotta watch this because it's

221
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:06,630
going to be sweeter.
If you watch it and you go through the

222
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:08,160
ups and downs and he goes,
no,

223
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:09,480
Daddy,
you need to tell me now.

224
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,441
And I go,
no,

225
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:12,540
you're gonna like it more if you just
watch it,

226
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,550
you got no daddy.
This Bruce Lee,

227
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:19,320
when he wants to fucking know,
he don't want to be disappointed.

228
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,060
Yeah.
So he got years old.

229
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,560
Yeah.
He got completely blown away.

230
00:10:22,561 --> 00:10:25,170
So a week later,
a week later,

231
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:29,460
I got today you're going to watch the
greatest martial arts movie of all time.

232
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,310
Enter the Dragon.
Cause it's Bruce Lee Dad,

233
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:33,270
isn't it?
I go,

234
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:34,104
yes,
it's

235
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,080
the real me.
Maybe chimpanzee.

236
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:38,090
Yeah.
That was gonna be like some Disney

237
00:10:38,091 --> 00:10:38,461
thing.
I was like,

238
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:40,290
holy cow.
What movie was at?

239
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,300
It's literally called chimpanzee.
Whom is it?

240
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:43,740
A documentary?
Yeah.

241
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,240
Yeah.
It's kind of like a documentary.

242
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:46,700
I was like,
damn,

243
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,280
I'm,
I mean,

244
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,700
they're mean.
Yeah,

245
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,280
they're cool.
Yeah.

246
00:10:51,281 --> 00:10:52,810
They're there.
They're calculated.

247
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

248
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:57,920
They sneak up on each other and like,
I didn't realize chimps did calculator.

249
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,660
Cruelty.
Yeah.

250
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,970
How's pretty,
ah,

251
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,650
I left that meeting thinking,
Whoa,

252
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,140
this is dark.
Right.

253
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:06,970
Well,
we know better because we've advanced,

254
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,790
but if we hadn't,
we'd be like,

255
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,590
man,
I don't want to fucking live in a house.

256
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,030
I like the champ ways,
bro.

257
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,610
Chimp ways to go.
This is it man.

258
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,820
Chimp life.
So I'm,

259
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,690
I now,
but we in a way to the AI might be like

260
00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:25,660
those chimps.
We like these stupid Fox launching

261
00:11:25,661 --> 00:11:28,890
missiles out of drones and shooting each
other underwater.

262
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,690
Like we're crazy.
We got torpedoes,

263
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,250
submarines and fucking airplanes.
It drop nuclear bombs indiscriminately

264
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:41,260
on cities were assholes.
Yeah.

265
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,600
They might go,
why are they doing this?

266
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:48,090
It might like look at our politics and
look at what we do in terms of our,

267
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:49,540
our,
our food system.

268
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,570
What,
what kind of food we forced down each

269
00:11:52,571 --> 00:11:53,980
other's throats.
And they might

270
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,130
go this,
these people are crazy.

271
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,530
Didn't even look out for themselves.
I don't know.

272
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,200
I'm like,
how much do we think about chimps?

273
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,700
Not much.
Very little.

274
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,280
It's like,
these chimps are at war.

275
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,920
He's like,
look,

276
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:10,390
it's like groups of chimps just attack
each other and they kill each other.

277
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,520
They torture each other.
That's pretty bad.

278
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,740
Um,
the hunt monkeys,

279
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,590
uh,
there,

280
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,290
but like,
this is probably the most,

281
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,880
but you know,
I mean,

282
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,160
when's the last time you talked about
chimps?

283
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,393
Let me,
yeah,

284
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,990
all the time you do talking to the
carwash podcast,

285
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,100
dude,
that's talking about chimps episode.

286
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,610
People are laughing right now.

287
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:43,450
Okay.
