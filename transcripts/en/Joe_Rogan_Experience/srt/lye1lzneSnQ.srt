00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello Freak bitches,

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,530
this article that I want to talk problem.

3
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:07,680
We got here a transgender woman.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,000
Um,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,811
she was a woman.

6
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:11,370
She applied to an all male,

7
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,810
all female college,

8
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:14,220
well was Wellesley,

9
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,240
Wellesley College.

10
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,141
I used to actually,

11
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:16,710
uh,

12
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,860
no girl from Wellesley back in the does a,

13
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:19,940
um,

14
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,830
it's an all girls' campus and um,

15
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,320
so she applied for the college.

16
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:30,321
She was born a female but then
decided to transition into,

17
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:31,740
uh,

18
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,170
she had a very hilarious,

19
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,071
this is hilarious.

20
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:39,270
Listened to the description of how
she introduces himself herself,

21
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:42,060
whatever masculine of center.

22
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,230
Gender Queer.

23
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,200
Exactly,

24
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:47,880
exactly.

25
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:48,180
Yeah.

26
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:48,810
I,

27
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,700
I am in love with this story and I am
in love with these kinds of people.

28
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,320
I am in love with people that are so
fucking preposterous that they take

29
00:00:58,321 --> 00:01:00,790
preposterous to an art form and they,

30
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:01,140
they,

31
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,590
they become living parody
whether they like it or not.

32
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,690
Listen to what the fuck I just said.

33
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,850
She goes to a college,

34
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:11,250
she applies to an all girls
college is super liberal.

35
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:12,690
All or all girls college.

36
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:18,050
She decides that she is transgender
and decides that she wants to,

37
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,210
she introduces herself as masculine of
center gender queer changes her name to

38
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:28,881
Timothy decided that she's Timothy and
ask people to use the male pronoun when

39
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:31,800
referring to him.

40
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,693
Okay,

41
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,150
so welcome on campus until the day
that she announced he announced,

42
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,331
okay t now,

43
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:40,050
whatever,

44
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,770
that he wanted to run for the school's
Office of multicultural affairs

45
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:46,780
coordinator whose job
is to promote a culture,

46
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,100
a culture of diversity now who you would
think would need diversity more than

47
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:54,750
someone who is a transgender man.

48
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,231
You know,

49
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:55,711
I mean that's,

50
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:56,151
that's a,

51
00:01:56,151 --> 00:02:01,151
a very small segment of the population
and they're often maligned and you know,

52
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,240
this is a socially marginalized group
and it would be nice for an open minded

53
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:09,840
liberal college to accept someone like
this and to recognize what a perfect

54
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:13,050
person to be a part of our campaign.

55
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,060
Encouraging people to,

56
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:15,450
uh,

57
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:15,960
you know,

58
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,260
to,

59
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,780
to be more open minded and accept people.

60
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:20,640
No,

61
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,640
they attacked her because now they felt
that she is a white man and they don't

62
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:31,680
want a white man in that position because
of a white man is in that position.

63
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,570
Then they're supporting the patriarchy.

64
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,670
So there was three other
candidates for the Gig,

65
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,360
right?

66
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,070
All women of color.

67
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:39,781
Wonderful.

68
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:40,261
If one of them,

69
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:41,340
when and then you got,

70
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:41,611
okay,

71
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:42,630
you know your problem solved.

72
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,310
You got a woman of color in that position.

73
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,660
Plenty of diversity there.

74
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,200
You're good,

75
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,850
right?

76
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:47,490
Eh?

77
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:47,851
No.

78
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:50,370
They all dropped out
and then they stayed at,

79
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,400
they started an anonymous Facebook
campaign encouraging people not to vote at

80
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:56,460
all,

81
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,470
to keep a white man from
winning the position.

82
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,033
Ah,

83
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,070
this is amazing.

84
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,500
This is the left eating itself.

85
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,370
That's what's happening.

86
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,660
They're eating themselves.

87
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,490
It is a feeding frenzy.

88
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,020
I used to have Paranas.

89
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,913
Okay.

90
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,600
And one of the things about products is,

91
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:13,781
well,

92
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:15,280
one gets a limp.

93
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,140
They just Jack that motherfucker.

94
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:18,760
They are the most ruthless cunts.

95
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,331
One.

96
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:20,620
One Parana would just be,

97
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,341
you know,

98
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:22,690
sometimes you have a fish tank,

99
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,361
one fish,

100
00:03:23,361 --> 00:03:24,580
we'll just start swimming weird.

101
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,250
They start swimming kind of
half sideways for some reason.

102
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:27,461
You're like,

103
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:28,420
is that fish okay?

104
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,610
And you have to look at him like
what's going on with that fish?

105
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,530
That shit didn't last in that tank,

106
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:33,190
baby.

107
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,340
No,

108
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,450
those mother fuckers are just,

109
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,230
they just started taking
chunks out of them.

110
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,700
That's what's happening here.

111
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,800
The left is the,

112
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,610
they're turning on themselves.

113
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,380
They've run out of outrage.

114
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,330
They've made so many safe places.

115
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:48,850
They don't want anything to be safe
anymore and they want to be able to go to

116
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:49,960
war over everything.

117
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,030
They're ferocious there.

118
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:57,031
Paranas their social idea Paranas
and they're attacking a gender quail,

119
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:03,420
gender queer masculine of center man
for not being diverse enough for being a

120
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:06,880
part of the patriarchy,

121
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,850
Bardo Woven board.

122
00:04:08,851 --> 00:04:10,570
A woman lived as a woman.

123
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,110
Nope,

124
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,160
you're a white man now.

125
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:13,300
You fucking piece of shit.

126
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,620
You're a part of the problem.

127
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,440
I makes no sense.

128
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,130
It does make sense though.

129
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,220
It makes sense because it highlights
what this movement is all about.

130
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,450
It's socially retarded.

131
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:29,710
People that are left alone to their own
devices and they're just devouring each

132
00:04:29,711 --> 00:04:30,790
other like zombies.

133
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,390
They just tearing into each other like,

134
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,780
like zombies that are
trapped into a fucking room.

135
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:35,001
It goes,

136
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:35,830
Rah,

137
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,300
they just ripping each other apart.

138
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,950
You're not diverse enough.

139
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,570
You're not progressive enough.

140
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,261
Fuck you.

141
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:41,951
You're such a pig.

142
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:42,784
I'm triggered.

143
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,680
They just trigger each
other left and right.

144
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:48,731
This is,

145
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:48,910
uh,

146
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,500
this is an onion article.

147
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,930
This is a fucking onion
article and it's not,

148
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,550
this is the national review.

149
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,700
This is a goddamn onion article and
it's not transgender woman can't be

150
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:02,740
diversity officer because
she's a white man.

151
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:07,741
Now I mixed 0 million cents makes all
the sense in the world that it's not a

152
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:11,741
fake article.

153
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:11,981
I mean,

154
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:13,670
that seems like 100% of fake.

155
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,470
It's perfect.

156
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,280
It's perfect.

157
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,180
It's amazing.

158
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,290
It's beautiful.

159
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,890
It's a rose is a rose
in a bad neighborhood.

160
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:23,770
It pops out of the concrete
and it comes out perfect.

161
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:24,970
It's amazing.

162
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,043
This is art.

163
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,440
It's,

164
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,320
it's the universe creating
art with our own folly.

165
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,333
That's what it is.

166
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,480
It's culture.

167
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,190
It's called,

168
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:32,540
it's,

169
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,610
it's people,

170
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,391
you know,

171
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:36,880
there's something that happens
to people when you deny reality,

172
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:38,410
when you don't look at things objectively.

173
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,370
Like there's,

174
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,670
there's I think like
priests that molests kids,

175
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,151
right?

176
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:45,310
Some of that has to be from suppression.

177
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,890
Some of it has to be probably
they were abused themselves.

178
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,030
There's probably all sorts of,

179
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:53,710
but some of that perversion has
got to come from suppression.

180
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,950
It's like the Catholic school
girl thing that everybody knows.

181
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,381
You know,

182
00:05:57,381 --> 00:05:58,370
when I was in high school,

183
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:01,520
there was no scientists in
my fucking ninth grade class,

184
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:05,540
but we all knew the girls who went to
Catholic schools were hose and why are

185
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,040
they host their hose?

186
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,900
Because everybody tells
them they can't be a Ho.

187
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,730
Everybody's talking to
them constantly about,

188
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,800
you are going to go to hell,

189
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,780
do not touch a man's genitals,

190
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:15,920
don't you do anything?

191
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,450
Those calls were freaks.

192
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:20,150
They were the biggest
freaks and we all knew it.

193
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:20,631
It was,

194
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:21,020
it was.

195
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,160
There was no books on it.

196
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,920
There was no youtube
videos that we could watch,

197
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,090
but we fucking knew it.

198
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:26,600
Man.

199
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,600
We all knew it and I think it's a
suppression issue and this is suppressing

200
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,410
individual identity.

201
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:35,120
This is suppressing free speech.

202
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,920
This is suppressing objectivity.

203
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,910
You're not allowed to have
unique or intertwined thoughts.

204
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,430
You're not allowed to share
opinions with the left.

205
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:44,120
And with the right.

206
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,140
You're not allowed to.

207
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:45,891
You have to have,

208
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:48,020
and you're constantly worried
about being called out.

209
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,730
You're constantly worried about being
outed and doxed and called out and shamed.

210
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,220
Everyone's shaming people
and attacking people.

211
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,560
And it's this fucking feeding frenzy.

212
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,043
I love it.

213
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,190
I'm happy.

214
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,290
I'm so happy when I
read a story like this.

215
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,130
I would encourage this woman to
fight to the death for her position.

216
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,820
Oh man,

217
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,653
she's a man now.

218
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,640
Fight to the death of that position.

219
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:11,631
I mean,

220
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:12,230
literally,

221
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:16,610
I want you to show up for school in a
fucking an armor with a sword and let them

222
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:17,720
know that you are,

223
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:21,220
you are here because you are a warrior
for diversity and you're going to,

224
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,050
you're going to take this to the very end,

225
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,670
to the very end of time.

226
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,380
Oh,

227
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,213
it's amazing.

228
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,800
This is an amazing story.

229
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,930
It's like one of the greatest stories
the universe has ever told cause it's,

230
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:36,764
it's just,

231
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,830
and it highlights that store that we
were just talking about where the,

232
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:40,664
um,

233
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,870
the thing that was up on the,

234
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:42,051
uh,

235
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:45,440
the thing earlier with the United
States is like a powder keg.

236
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:50,690
This is like what we're talking about
like entitled ridiculous people that they

237
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:51,800
don't live in reality.

238
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,001
You're,

239
00:07:52,001 --> 00:07:52,241
you're,

240
00:07:52,241 --> 00:07:52,941
you're not looking,

241
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:53,120
you're,

242
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,680
you're concentrating on nonsense.

243
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,630
But why are they
concentrating on nonsense?

244
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,120
Because they don't have to
worry about feeding themselves.

245
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,710
They don't have to worry about shelter.

246
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,660
They don't have to worry
about being in Ohio,

247
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:07,490
have no fucking power for a week
and everybody has to stay alive.

248
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:08,990
You can't get to work.

249
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,690
Everybody's like walking back
and forth to each other's house.

250
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:16,610
Sharon food and going out and getting
firewood together and dragging it back at

251
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:17,810
some little kids wagon.

252
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,730
That's what people do
when they want to survive.

253
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,650
When,

254
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,950
when you want to survive,

255
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,310
you come up with ways that
you could all work together.

256
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,110
When it's too easy to survive,

257
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,830
you start attacking people for nonsense
and that's what the fuck is going on

258
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:31,190
here.

259
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,110
You've got a campaign to keep.

260
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,880
We're going to make sure that a white man,

261
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:35,690
it's not going to win this.

262
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,400
Like as if she's really a white man.

263
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,820
Why are we pretending that's a man
left of Weird Gender Queer masculine of

264
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:44,181
center.

265
00:08:44,181 --> 00:08:45,590
Shut the fuck up.

266
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,730
You're a girl,

267
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,380
you're a girl or a guy,

268
00:08:48,381 --> 00:08:49,340
whatever you are.

269
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,150
Who cares what the fuck it was
probably way more to this story.

270
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:54,670
She's just a big bitch and I like

271
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,620
eating too much pussy on campus.

272
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,400
They're all mad.

273
00:08:59,400 --> 00:08:59,590
Yeah.

274
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,960
She always just too good at it.

275
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,950
She's too good at it.

276
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,690
But she's gender queer,

277
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:05,070
so that means I don't
think you'd do anything.

278
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,050
I don't know what that means.

279
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,730
I don't even think they
know what it means.

280
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,230
But you,

281
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,890
you ever heard of Pan Sexual?

282
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,020
There was a woman who was like,

283
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,340
she was making history.

284
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,420
This is hilarious.

285
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,010
This is a hilarious story.

286
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,740
She was making history
cause she was the first Gen.

287
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:19,921
Oh,

288
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:23,580
she was the first pan
sexual person to take office

289
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,160
pants.

290
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,020
What the fuck are you talking about?

291
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,240
What does that mean to me?

292
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:33,360
And she doesn't sexually identify.

293
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:38,250
She's not particularly sexually attracted
to either race or either gender.

294
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,690
It's either one or both.

295
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,700
Miley Cyrus,

296
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,150
Miley Cyrus is pansexual.

297
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,163
Of course she is.

298
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,610
That's called being a freak.

299
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:46,980
Pansexual.

300
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,270
What exactly does that mean?

301
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:48,721
But go,

302
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,010
go find the politician.

303
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,500
First politician as pansexual.

304
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,360
It's just so stupid.

305
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,950
Pen Sexual politician.

306
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,750
Since like a new word for bisexual,

307
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,190
it's not even bisexual.

308
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,160
It's cause like they have to be special.

309
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,640
It has to be met.

310
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,740
Mary Gonzales,

311
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:08,640
Texas state representative identifies
as pansexual in new interview.

312
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,631
First of all,

313
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:10,464
good for her.

314
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,491
Eat that pussy.

315
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:12,450
Suck that Dick.

316
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,351
Have a party.

317
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:13,920
Honey,

318
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,753
I'm not hating.

319
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,281
Do whatever you want,

320
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:19,650
but do we really have to
make a new name for it?

321
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,910
Fucking Christ.

322
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,350
I and I,

323
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:22,650
I,

324
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:26,010
I posted something about this awhile
back on Twitter and there was people that

325
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:27,660
were defending the term pansexual.

326
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:28,080
I'm like,

327
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,460
fuck you.

328
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,770
Fuck you for trying to muddy up the war.

329
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,310
Fuck you for having this on your
mind unless you're mocking it.

330
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,410
Fuck you for taking this seriously.

331
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,690
Fuck you for this being an actual thing.

332
00:10:39,691 --> 00:10:41,160
When you want to debate it,

333
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,810
how bad is your job?

334
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,540
How bored are you at work that you're
sitting in front of your Twitter account

335
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,420
defending pansexuality you stop.

336
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,160
You stop.

337
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,060
I'm saying she could do it.

338
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,953
I have no problem with,

339
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,033
don't get me wrong,

340
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,600
but you fucking stop.

341
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:55,890
If you think you're going to defend that,

342
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:56,611
fuck you.

343
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:58,320
You need to go cut snow cuts.

344
00:10:58,321 --> 00:10:58,780
No,

345
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,613
you need to go cut.

346
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,620
Trees need to go cut trees and shovel
snow over Jamie's parents house in the

347
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,450
middle of the winter when the
fucking power's off for a month.

348
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,280
That's what you need to do.

349
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,200
You need to dig Brian red bands,

350
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:11,640
mom out of the fucking woods.

351
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,020
Dig Out of the woods.

352
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,480
It's a mile dirt road
back to that lady's house.

353
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,800
Get get going.

354
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:17,634
Fuck face.

355
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,271
That's like,

356
00:11:18,271 --> 00:11:18,720
what does that,

357
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,920
how many thousand feet is a mile?

358
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,720
Five thousand five thousand plus
feet of snow shoveling you fuck.

359
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:29,520
How much for the driveway do you remember
that you remember that when you're a

360
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:29,791
kid,

361
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,340
you'd go to a lady's house and,

362
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:32,700
uh,

363
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,061
ma'am,

364
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:33,261
we're,

365
00:11:33,261 --> 00:11:34,091
we're shoveling stone.

366
00:11:34,091 --> 00:11:34,231
Well,

367
00:11:34,231 --> 00:11:35,370
how much for the driveway?

368
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:35,670
Like,

369
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:35,851
oh,

370
00:11:35,851 --> 00:11:37,020
we're going to need 20 for this one.

371
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:38,130
That's too much.

372
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,480
That's too much.

373
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,590
It's a long driveway.

374
00:11:40,591 --> 00:11:42,030
Man was going to take us a couple hours.

375
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:42,581
Oh,

376
00:11:42,581 --> 00:11:43,890
well that's just too much.

377
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,360
They would get mad.

378
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:55,310
Okay.
