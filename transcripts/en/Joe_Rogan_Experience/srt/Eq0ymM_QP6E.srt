1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,730
Bam,
all right.

2
00:00:02,731 --> 00:00:07,731
We're live,
ladies and gentlemen with a whole new 

3
00:00:07,731 --> 00:00:07,731
setup.
A.

4
00:00:07,731 --> 00:00:07,731
Yeah.
Yeah.

5
00:00:07,731 --> 00:00:10,620
When they listen man,
I'm very irresponsible.

6
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,120
You know,
it's gonna be really cool is when we get

7
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:15,870
something right back here.
That's the next step.

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,150
We're trying to figure out what to put 
right back there.

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,090
Most likely is going to be a green 
screen because I'm looking at this right

10
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:21,480
now.
I'm like,

11
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:23,790
how dope would it be if we were in 
fucking space right now?

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,960
We can have like captain Kurt ship 
behind us like late also.

13
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,880
We have a real desk.
Um,

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,630
we have real microphones now,
so,

15
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:36,780
uh,
the iphone version and IPAD and I,

16
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,540
whatever the fuck you use,
MP3 is going to be much better,

17
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,780
much clearer.
And we're fucking fired up.

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,120
We are not sponsored by starbucks.
This is just coincidence that we have to

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,160
happen to have that.
But we have had an offer for our very 

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,270
first sponsor and it is the fleshlight 
awesome.

21
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,240
I got some funny to tell you,
Joe,

22
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,450
by the way.
Hold on a second.

23
00:00:57,451 --> 00:00:59,910
We've got to tell people.
So the fleshlight

24
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:00,770
is,
uh,

25
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,380
if you don't know what it is,
if you're,

26
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,710
you're,
you're not a,

27
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,190
an online type person,
it's a,

28
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:11,850
a very famous device that you can fuck.
And uh,

29
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:16,851
one of the reasons why it's famous 
because it's supposed to feel really 

30
00:01:16,851 --> 00:01:19,041
good.
It's supposed to feel like way better 

31
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:20,541
than your hand.
And the other reason is that there was 

32
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:20,541
that,
that thing that was online,

33
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:22,110
like I accidentally the whole 
flashlight.

34
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,290
What was that Guy Pranking?
Uh,

35
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:30,291
I think it was a customer service rep 
that a saying only as something that he,

36
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,530
he is a flashlight or something like it 
was a really bad accident.

37
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,990
No flush Elo Carola.
Well cat,

38
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,580
well this guy

39
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,800
watched that or heard that thing or 
remember it.

40
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:46,801
But I do remember that that fleshlight 
thing got stuck in my head because of 

41
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:49,390
that because everybody kept saying it.
And uh,

42
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,740
it just,
it's,

43
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,710
it's like one of those things where 
like,

44
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,180
you,
you know,

45
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,020
you hear about it so often on the 
internet just because of that.

46
00:01:56,021 --> 00:01:57,880
So when they contacted me I was like,
wow,

47
00:01:57,881 --> 00:02:02,220
that's kinda cool.
Then when he told me that he sponsored a

48
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,070
Kevin Smith podcasts,
I'm like,

49
00:02:03,071 --> 00:02:04,160
wow,
that's super cool.

50
00:02:04,161 --> 00:02:06,580
Like he's going to do our podcast and 
Kevin Smith's podcast.

51
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:09,580
That sounds fucking bad ass.
And then we met the dude and Chris was a

52
00:02:09,581 --> 00:02:12,210
super cool guy and uh,
you know,

53
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,130
uh,
just a real chill do that you could hang

54
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,140
with like a normal guy.
And he was really a kind of a spiritual 

55
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,461
guy too,
which is kind of interesting because we 

56
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:23,461
were talking about the porn side and 
how,

57
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:23,461
you know,
porn is kind of gross,

58
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,170
you know,
there's a lot of porn now that you don't

59
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,240
really would necessarily want to be 
associated with either really good at 

60
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,451
his job researching you because he 
seemed like your long lost brother 

61
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:37,470
document because he was like pulling out
documentaries you didn't even know 

62
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:37,470
about,
like books that I didn't know about when

63
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,180
that was the weird,
like you guys would be good for.

64
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,590
You guys were gay.
You'd be perfect.

65
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:42,610
Perfect Lover,
lover.

66
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

67
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:44,650
He was

68
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,500
real bright guy,
man.

69
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,520
When we talked about me and Musashi,
we talked about different schools of 

70
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:51,960
philosophy,
different books that he's read.

71
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:52,920
Yes.
Different.

72
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,480
Uh,
different volcanoes.

73
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:59,481
He knew about some super volcanoes 
exploding in the past that I didn't 

74
00:02:59,481 --> 00:02:59,481
even.

75
00:02:59,481 --> 00:02:59,481
Right.
You got to get them on the shelf.

76
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,500
Yes,
definitely.

77
00:03:00,501 --> 00:03:01,190
He,
unfortunately,

78
00:03:01,191 --> 00:03:03,650
he lives in Austin,
but the next time we're in Austin,

79
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:08,651
what we'll do is we'll bring our 
equipment and everything is set up in 

80
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:10,640
Austin or we can move there.
I fucked up.

81
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:13,400
I fucked up moving to Colorado for a 
bunch of reasons.

82
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,190
One,
because Mrs Rogan can't fucking drive in

83
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:17,710
the snow,
which is just a,

84
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,480
it's not good.
And if you know Mrs Rogan,

85
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:25,750
that's not something that I'm going to 
be comfortable with her learning really 

86
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,630
quickly.
Just that doesn't seem like a good move.

87
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:32,050
Just fucking moving where it's freezes 
and shit gets dangerous and sliding the 

88
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,550
trees and shit.
And then when the dog,

89
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,390
when the dog got eaten by the mountain 
lion,

90
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:36,860
that killed it.
Yeah.

91
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,630
Otherwise,
Austin would have been great.

92
00:03:38,631 --> 00:03:39,310
And if our.
Anyway,

93
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,320
the point is if Austin was great,
we would definitely hang around with 

94
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,320
Chris Kelly,

95
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,480
but what's funny is he gave us a sample 
so we can feel and touch it of the 

96
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,430
flashlight and the fleshlight uses 
patent and rubber technology.

97
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,930
They have a patent on this shit.
Yeah.

98
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:58,020
It's a very specific type of insert.
The bushy squishy stuff has their own 

99
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,380
proprietary blends.

100
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,390
Yeah,
and it's like you,

101
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,830
you think in your head like,
Oh,

102
00:04:01,831 --> 00:04:04,420
I'm sure it feels like rubber and oil.
Like it's not gonna.

103
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,060
It's just gonna feel like really soft 
rubber.

104
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,430
This actually is kind of creepy to feel 
it.

105
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,740
Was He.
He gave us a sample.

106
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:15,741
What he did is he took a couple of 
flashlights and he cut it in half just 

107
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:18,531
so we can feel the actual rubber part 
and then at the end of our dentists and 

108
00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:19,320
really feel like puts you though.
It felt.

109
00:04:19,321 --> 00:04:20,550
It feels soft.
Yeah,

110
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,940
it feels really good.
It feels really.

111
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,610
Hasn't even moved up though.
No,

112
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,090
it's not even lose.
So he gave us the samples too.

113
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:27,690
Mushy.
It's like a pushy that sick.

114
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,240
Well because it's usually in a can.
It's usually,

115
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:31,300
it's,
it's got some bonus

116
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,710
behind you want like,
oh,

117
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,950
but wouldn't,
would that make it more clear?

118
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:35,890
Yeah.
Yeah.

119
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:39,070
Because you have like a wall right now.
We actually have a box of them.

120
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,360
Yeah.
So anyways,

121
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:45,361
he gave us these samples,
just a few of them and we left them on 

122
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:45,500
the table and I'm like,
you're not going to take that.

123
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:46,120
And he was like,
Oh,

124
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,180
you know,
it's just trash just so you can see 

125
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:51,180
like,
you know what I'm going to take it.

126
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,510
So I took the samples and I had it there
in a bag and the other day,

127
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,860
uh,
I decided when no one was around that I 

128
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,300
would try to fuck one of the samples,
but it was only half of it.

129
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,050
So have you used both of them?
One for the bottom and one for the top.

130
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,080
And so it's doing the left hand and the 
right hand left hand was the left 

131
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,080
sample,
the right with the right sample.

132
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,720
And I'm like,
wait a second,

133
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,270
fleshlight company you need something 
like that.

134
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,700
Because I had like two different hand 
jobs going on.

135
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,740
I had one with a different texture on 
the top.

136
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,970
One on yourself off with two hands like 
you're milking.

137
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,830
Milking a cow will.
How you work in the balls.

138
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,120
It's hung on the bottom.
I put the balls in the bottom one.

139
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,860
I wrapped it around the bottom one.
So it's kind of to your balls around the

140
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:28,670
bottom one.
How fucking smaller balls.

141
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,070
They're very,
very small,

142
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,180
but I was doing both of them.
I used to eat a lot of Nmr.

143
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,010
You remember the falls?
She cried,

144
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,680
but anyways,
it felt really real.

145
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,470
I only had hot water and lube.
Yeah,

146
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:42,840
for a loop,
but it felt really good,

147
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:47,850
like shampoo or something I'm good at 
because it's supposed to be a water 

148
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:51,121
based oil and that.
So they felt good for even just being 

149
00:05:51,121 --> 00:05:51,400
samples outside of its cocoon and 
everything.

150
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:56,401
It wasn't even in the can or anything,
so I can't wait to fuck one of these 

151
00:05:56,401 --> 00:05:56,401
things.
Is this one of them right now?

152
00:05:56,401 --> 00:05:57,110
These are.
These are the ones.

153
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,860
This is not without some controversy.
I don't.

154
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,630
This is actually going to be really 
loud,

155
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:07,631
so to speak softly as possible.
I'm willing to do it

156
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,830
so it's not annoying.
This is a.

157
00:06:10,831 --> 00:06:13,860
apparently this is a,
this is the fleshlight wow.

158
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,090
It comes in a nice packaging like,
like,

159
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,820
are you going to do an unboxing video 
for us,

160
00:06:17,821 --> 00:06:18,280
Joe?
Yes.

161
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,270
We'll do the flashlight.
Let's see what we got here.

162
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,840
Now this is not without some controversy
and this is where it gets strange.

163
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,340
Um,
my manager is very,

164
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:29,510
very upset with me.
Yeah.

165
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,580
And does not think that the fleshlight 
is a good thing to have for a sponsor.

166
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:42,110
And um,
I was surprised with that because they 

167
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,290
were like really adamant about it.
They were like,

168
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,500
you could be up for some sort of a show 
cbs and they find out that you have the 

169
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,170
flashlight on,
on your podcast.

170
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,510
You know,
that you're sponsored by a thing,

171
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,730
not just that you have an opinion about 
a thing.

172
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,060
They were saying that the big deal is 
that you are sponsored by this thing and

173
00:07:00,061 --> 00:07:03,060
because you're sponsored by this thing 
somehow or another that makes you like,

174
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,970
what does that make you?
A bad person?

175
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,400
Yes.
Because you don't masturbate your hand.

176
00:07:08,401 --> 00:07:08,970
Yeah.
You're,

177
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:14,030
you're,
you're a bad person because you 

178
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:14,490
preferred to masturbate with the rubber 
vagina.

179
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,840
Right.
Like really

180
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,740
old school.

181
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,080
It's crazy talk,
right?

182
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:24,110
Like,
it's crazy the idea that you don't 

183
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:24,110
masturbate if you don't masturbate.
What's wrong with you?

184
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:24,110
Like it's a,
it's a great.

185
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,040
Feels good.
Okay.

186
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,010
First of all to.
It's a great way of getting a release,

187
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:30,080
like a sexual release.
So it's not built up.

188
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:32,990
It's on annoying you all day because if 
you're not getting laid.

189
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:34,730
Okay.
And a lot of us aren't.

190
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,280
If you're not getting laid and you don't
jerk off,

191
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:39,290
you're going to go fucking bananas.
Right?

192
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:39,890
Yeah,
that's,

193
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,300
that's a fact.
It's totally fair.

194
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,160
So what is this some sort of a leftover 
purity?

195
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,910
Yeah.
Don't show your ankles,

196
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,030
your ankles.
Technology.

197
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:48,370
Fucking

198
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,720
put dresses over the legs of chairs.
You ever seen those,

199
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,340
those buildings where they put or those,
uh,

200
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,280
old uh,
um,

201
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,790
like furniture from like,
you know,

202
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,480
I don't know what year it was,
way,

203
00:07:57,481 --> 00:07:58,980
way,
way back in the Victorian era.

204
00:07:58,981 --> 00:08:03,981
I guess when they put,
they would literally put dresses around 

205
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:03,981
the legs of chair,

206
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:06,840
a place like lacey so that people don't 
get excited by fucking chair,

207
00:08:06,841 --> 00:08:09,390
but it was like Brah you remember go to 
your grandmother's house and seeing like

208
00:08:09,391 --> 00:08:13,470
that old white croquet kit table was.
What was it called?

209
00:08:13,471 --> 00:08:15,750
It was kind of like a white lacey,
you know,

210
00:08:15,751 --> 00:08:17,130
old people.
Dolese.

211
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,410
Is that what is doily?

212
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,720
I don't think it's the same thing.
I don't think.

213
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,200
Oh,
look at you.

214
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,310
You're doing it.
Any Bravo right now?

215
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:27,311
You fuck you.
Fuck my sits on airplane mode.

216
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,930
I thought,
oh well I'm going to put them on there.

217
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,740
So yeah.
So they used to put doilies type shit on

218
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:37,440
furniture that was almost like lace of a
bra to cover up the.

219
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:41,660
The ankles of a chair or a leg of a 
table.

220
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,670
Crazier people.
How fucking

221
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,910
crazier people and how crazy is that?
Me Of all people,

222
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:53,420
like all the shit that I've talked about
from fucking dmt to the fact that I 

223
00:08:54,121 --> 00:08:57,030
think the government,
Kennedy and the same people are probably

224
00:08:57,031 --> 00:09:00,190
in power and giant fucking corporations 
control the world.

225
00:09:00,191 --> 00:09:00,280
And

226
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,500
you have a video of you and me watching 
two girls and one cup and then you 

227
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,770
showing no,
you've got to watch a video of a Guy Cha

228
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,750
chopping off their debt,
but yet you can't masturbate.

229
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,750
That's okay.
But masturbation is terrible.

230
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,000
It's,
it makes no sense at all of all the shit

231
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:20,001
that I'm put it up on the Internet.
I try to be as honest as possible and I 

232
00:09:20,001 --> 00:09:21,230
try to put as much on the Internet about
things that I'm interested in.

233
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,530
I don't care if you think I'm crazy and 
out there.

234
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,210
I don't care if you know,
you think it's inappropriate or look,

235
00:09:26,211 --> 00:09:27,920
I'm just curious about this certain 
subject.

236
00:09:27,921 --> 00:09:32,921
Here it is.
Whether it's on my message board or 

237
00:09:32,921 --> 00:09:32,921
whether we're talking about on this,
this,

238
00:09:32,921 --> 00:09:36,760
this,
a podcast or whether we put it on 

239
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:36,760
twitter,
you know,

240
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:36,760
if I find something,
I think it's interesting.

241
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,230
I'm going to be honest about it.
Like why is that a fucking bad thing?

242
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:44,910
You know?
And why is the idea of me fucking this 

243
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,000
rubber flashlight?
Why is that a bad thing?

244
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Because I don't think people in Middle 
America wants to think of you 

245
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,140
masturbating and then if that gets 
thrown in their faces.

246
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Yeah,
because you're not supposed to hand in 

247
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,200
their face.
You're not supposed to have sex too.

248
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,290
So that's what it is when,
when you don't want people to see people

249
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:07,291
having sex or talking about sex too much
and if you endorse sex with yourself,

250
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,460
that's a bad thing.
I don't know.

251
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,220
I,
I,

252
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,090
to me it's like,
I mean,

253
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,430
you can't marry that with the craziest.

254
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,810
The thing is they said,
the manager said that,

255
00:10:16,811 --> 00:10:21,811
uh,
that one of the things that we're 

256
00:10:21,811 --> 00:10:21,811
talking about was the fact that this 
isn't the pornography industry.

257
00:10:21,811 --> 00:10:26,450
That's what they said.
It's the pornography that it's 

258
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:26,450
pornography.
And I said,

259
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:26,450
how is it involved in pornography 
industry?

260
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,080
It's,
it's like it's just a rubber vagina.

261
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:29,710
They're like,
well,

262
00:10:29,711 --> 00:10:31,720
when you use it you watch pornography.

263
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,000
So that was an actual argument.
So,

264
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:40,070
so like how can we can't do it?
You can either do it with your 

265
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:40,070
imagination.
It has to involve pornography.

266
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:40,320
Joe,
how many,

267
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,630
how many documentaries have you done on 
DMT and drugs?

268
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,880
So the drug industry's okay,
but the porn industry,

269
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:47,610
the Janet Jackson Nipple industry is 
just out of control.

270
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,320
Insane.
It's why.

271
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:55,310
I don't know what you just said.
You might pay a little bit too much to 

272
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:55,310
talk right now.
You know what I'm saying?

273
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,440
Many rambled with your women's 
documentaries.

274
00:10:56,441 --> 00:10:57,990
Have you done about drugs?
I've done.

275
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,880
So the drug industry to your managers 
fine with drug industry is not really an

276
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:02,660
industry.
Well,

277
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,380
the idea is that a documentary is 
different because it's just your opinion

278
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:09,050
on a certain subject.
Whereas this is an endorsement.

279
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,080
That's the argument.
Endorsement endorsements were endorsed 

280
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,200
by marijuana.
Was marijuana is illegal.

281
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,090
You are endorsed by marijuana and 
endorsement.

282
00:11:17,091 --> 00:11:18,050
Marijuana.
Marijuana.

283
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,020
Actually none of the only sponsors this 
show.

284
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,360
It writes most of the material and 
causes most of the things to happen.

285
00:11:24,361 --> 00:11:26,810
And he's the producer with marijuana is 
the senior producer.

286
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,700
Train wreck.
Train wreck.

287
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,640
This week it was green crack,
crack.

288
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,880
Crack is executive producer,
secret executive producer of this show 

289
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,070
this week.
Yeah.

290
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:37,850
No Shit.
So,

291
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:43,030
so this is a real argument right now.
The real argument is that if I endorse 

292
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,360
this thing that somehow or another,
it would be a bad thing.

293
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,080
Packaging on.
That's.

294
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,280
I think that's the butthole is have,
but maybe that's the vagina.

295
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,950
Wow.
This is a super tight.

296
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,020
No.
Can we just touch it and they put.

297
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:53,290
They

298
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,390
give me one and a half.
I've been wearing them.

299
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,070
I don't want to have her.
Do you have a loop?

300
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,880
A One?
Have a loop.

301
00:11:57,881 --> 00:11:58,780
Hey,
if you guys know Lupus.

302
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,770
She was on the Howard Stern show.

303
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,520
It's like Christmas.
Listen,

304
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,870
this ain't no motherfucking clear.
The table of all the junk.

305
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,550
This is way less annoying than the way I
used to have.

306
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,990
Yeah,
there's some junk on the table.

307
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,280
How about this?
I'll take this out.

308
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,600
Move this out of the way with that 
helping.

309
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,910
It does look a little bit if I do that.
How about that?

310
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:22,911
I'm cleaning up for you guys.
That's the difference between the 

311
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,600
ustream crowd and the iphone.
IPAD,

312
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:27,570
ipod crowd.
So that's the flashlight fellow.

313
00:12:27,571 --> 00:12:27,980
Fuck it.

314
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:33,330
I got the stamina training unit.
Did you have to practice v longer in 

315
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,570
bed?
It says,

316
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:39,630
every man knows,
the only way to get better is to 

317
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,290
practice view can last 10 minutes in the
unit.

318
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,540
You can last 20 minutes in bed with 
anyone.

319
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,370
Wow,
that's bold.

320
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,220
That's strong words.
That was one of the things that this guy

321
00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:53,221
was telling us.
What's one of the more fascinating 

322
00:12:53,221 --> 00:12:55,111
things about this whole thing was the 
actual therapeutic applications of the 

323
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:58,090
flashlight,
and this sounds like nonsense.

324
00:12:58,091 --> 00:13:00,640
Sounds like someone's just justifying 
trying to fuck a rubber pussy,

325
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,690
but know what they use them for a bunch 
of different therapeutic reasons.

326
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:09,691
And one of them is a,
people in certain religions aren't 

327
00:13:09,691 --> 00:13:12,571
allowed to touch their penis and because
they're not allowed to touch their 

328
00:13:12,571 --> 00:13:12,571
penis.
These guys,

329
00:13:12,571 --> 00:13:15,160
he said that his city Jews in particular
actually have a hard time,

330
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:20,350
um,
orgasming when they have sex with women 

331
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,190
because they're so used to like fucking 
pillows because they do most of their 

332
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,370
masturbation like grabbing a sheet or 
grabbing a pillow.

333
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:25,870
This is his words,
not mine.

334
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:28,150
This,
this could be totally nonsense.

335
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:28,870
I don't know.

336
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,210
I have not researched this at all.
That's my caveat.

337
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,100
But he said that,
um,

338
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:38,340
the flashlight is actually covered by 
some insurance policies as therapy,

339
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:44,130
as sexual therapy,
to get them to learn how to orgasm with 

340
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,180
a vagina instead of fucking like some 
rough pillow.

341
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,500
So I don't know.
I have not validated this.

342
00:13:50,501 --> 00:13:51,520
I don't know whether that's true.
Yeah,

343
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:56,630
it totally makes sense to me.
And the other reason for the fresh 

344
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,650
flashlight is it trains guys not to 
prematurely ejaculate.

345
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,500
And guys who have problems with 
premature ejaculation,

346
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,660
they can practice in the flashlight.
That's the idea.

347
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,650
You're supposed to take this to.

348
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,660
Oh,
that doesn't,

349
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,700
doesn't feel good.

350
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,080
Metal plastic card asked him.
Yeah,

351
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,140
don't get too crazy.
Pull your Dick outside.

352
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,450
I'll fucking panic.
So,

353
00:14:16,451 --> 00:14:18,760
um,
so I don't think there's any.

354
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,650
Look,
obviously we all masturbate.

355
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,680
It's,
it's silly at this point in this stage 

356
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:25,680
of life to,
to deny that it,

357
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:25,680
it's,
it's,

358
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,740
it doesn't make any sense.
It's dumb.

359
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,430
So if we all masturbate,
what is the,

360
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,130
what's wrong with this thing?
You know,

361
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,880
what's wrong with this?

362
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You know what's crazy?
I do things like smoke cigarettes are 

363
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,120
used to smoke cigarettes in the car and 
have a of of my hand.

364
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,660
I think therapeutically I can put this 
in my car instead of smoking cigarettes.

365
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:42,580
Just finger.
It doesn't feel so good.

366
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,840
I mean,
don't touch my butt.

367
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,060
I mean that's something to do with my 
hand.

368
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:48,430
Like,
like,

369
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,470
like that feels good.
That feels like I'm playing with like 

370
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,020
one of those stress balls,
but it actually feels like I'm 10 

371
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,600
percent woman doing it.
Wow.

372
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,960
Touching on strong numbers.
Let's strong number son.

373
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:05,080
I think there is a lot of things like 
that because there was something else 

374
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,260
you were saying about people.
A lot of medical reasons.

375
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,170
Like was something else that he said 
besides that,

376
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,550
uh,
religion.

377
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,190
There was like doctors that would use it
for a while.

378
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,950
The,
we already recovered that.

379
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,240
Doctors use it for premature ejaculation
and religions that don't masturbate.

380
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:23,750
You're way too high on lady here.
He blasted.

381
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,270
Seems distracted.
That's why I tried to keep the ipad away

382
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:31,271
from him.
I told you I took one too many hits 

383
00:15:31,271 --> 00:15:32,981
today.
He did take one to many and went over 

384
00:15:32,981 --> 00:15:32,981
the deep end king outside.

385
00:15:32,981 --> 00:15:32,981
It's my fault.
Um,

386
00:15:32,981 --> 00:15:34,620
so what,
what I don't understand.

387
00:15:34,621 --> 00:15:37,260
And I don't wanna I don't wanna I 
definitely wanna hear from you guys.

388
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,320
I'm just let me know on twitter at Joe 
Rogan.

389
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,820
I'm just my name now.
Joe Rogan.

390
00:15:41,821 --> 00:15:46,821
He used to be doc.net
[inaudible] dot net because some dudes 

391
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:46,821
cybersquatting on my name but I got it 
back.

392
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:47,850
Thank you very much.
Twitter,

393
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,620
my account got verified and all that 
shit.

394
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,020
Um,
but I,

395
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,040
I want to know,
do you think it's ridiculous because I 

396
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,040
think it's ridiculous.
And what is there?

397
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,230
Is there really a bunch of you out there
that would not want to see something and

398
00:15:58,231 --> 00:16:03,231
I'm doing whatever the fuck it is 
because you know that I support rubber 

399
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:03,990
pussies.
Like is it possible that that could cost

400
00:16:03,991 --> 00:16:08,991
somebody's business?
I mean in this day and age when the 

401
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:09,060
fucking pope.
Okay,

402
00:16:09,061 --> 00:16:12,240
it's not being brought to justice for 
shielding child molesters.

403
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,310
You're really going to get upset at me 
if I endorse her rubber pushing me.

404
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:21,340
The pope has endorsed by the goddamn 
presidents of every goddamn country in 

405
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,870
the world and this guy shielded,
shielded pedophiles.

406
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,860
I mean,
it's a fact.

407
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:26,520
He did.
He's a,

408
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,740
he's a part of the problem with the 
Catholic Church.

409
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,870
That motherfucker is accepted 
everywhere,

410
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,690
but I'll be about,
am I comparing myself to the pope?

411
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:34,780
I guess I am.
Folks.

412
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:35,270
I just fucked up.

413
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:40,390
I did.
I don't know why there's some grandy 

414
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,500
grandiose delusions of grandeur in my 
head.

415
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,300
I connect my because I've always wanted 
aware of it.

416
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,650
Dope as robe show,
show up for work dressed like a marilyn.

417
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:52,190
But you know,
I don't think there's anything wrong 

418
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:52,190
with masturbating.
Obviously you don't either.

419
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:52,980
We all,
we all do it.

420
00:16:52,981 --> 00:16:57,981
I don't think there's anything wrong 
with a product that makes masturbation 

421
00:16:57,981 --> 00:16:57,981
easier or better.
And that's what it is.

422
00:16:57,981 --> 00:17:00,800
I support it and you know,
so I'm,

423
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:02,550
I'm,
I'm not going to listen to my managers.

424
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,390
I'm gonna tell him

425
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,830
go fuck themselves.
But he made it,

426
00:17:04,831 --> 00:17:09,831
but I love them.
You made an awesome point like women in 

427
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:09,831
their dildos and vibrators that almost,
you know,

428
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:12,210
when people get married at like bachelor
parties and stuff,

429
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,350
that's like a joke,
you know,

430
00:17:13,351 --> 00:17:15,210
that's like,
that's their toy.

431
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,010
Guys have never really had any,
any,

432
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,380
any,
any real legit toys.

433
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,280
You know,
it's true.

434
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,250
This is the first one that actually 
makes sense.

435
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,280
Instead of using your hand.
When did you use something that feels 

436
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,280
100 times better?
Yeah,

437
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,870
that is the art and I can't wait to fuck
it and I may get a cantaloupe,

438
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,580
put it in the microwave,
microwave,

439
00:17:32,581 --> 00:17:35,490
put a little hole in it and warm it up a
little and we fucked that first.

440
00:17:35,491 --> 00:17:37,650
Wait a half hour and then fuck this and 
see which one's better.

441
00:17:37,651 --> 00:17:38,970
Cantaloupe is your move,
right?

442
00:17:38,971 --> 00:17:40,350
You've done that before.
I've done it before.

443
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,910
It's great because you.
After you fuck it,

444
00:17:41,911 --> 00:17:44,490
you could totally eat it,
so I just wash it out.

445
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,350
Don't even layer,
don't eat,

446
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,510
don't eat,
don't eat the layer rude.

447
00:17:48,511 --> 00:17:50,010
Someone calling during my fucking

448
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,730
podcast.
I would shut that off.

449
00:17:53,731 --> 00:17:58,731
I knew it was cliche management.
They're there.

450
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,010
They're listening to the podcast right 
now,

451
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:02,910
like,
hey man,

452
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,600
let's talk about this man.
Put this out there.

453
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,860
That's funny that your managers.
That's cool.

454
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,150
That doesn't stop because you'd start 
talking to that.

455
00:18:12,151 --> 00:18:12,670
No,
just

456
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,680
listen.
That's hilarious.

457
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,480
It's hilarious.
They called right when we're talking 

458
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:21,480
about,
you know,

459
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,040
I see what they're saying.
They're trying to protect me from like,

460
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:27,100
you know,
like if I had to do a show like fear 

461
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,100
factor or something like that,
maybe that could be a problem.

462
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,100
Yeah.
But you'd still.

463
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,990
Producers Horses.
Dick's.

464
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,800
Yeah.
I feel like you got to take me as I am.

465
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,540
You know,
I'm not a bad guy.

466
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,050
Whenever you don't want to do some sort 
of.

467
00:18:36,051 --> 00:18:38,780
I don't want to do a fear factor again.
I really don't.

468
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,720
I mean it's so tempting not to for the 
money,

469
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,730
but I got to do something more 
interesting.

470
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:46,700
I got to do shit that I like doing 
because I have so much more fun.

471
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,460
So it's almost like getting in bed with 
a flashlight.

472
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:54,490
It's like protects me from doing 
anything stupid that I know I'll do for 

473
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:54,490
money.
You know?

474
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:59,080
It's just so easy when something like 
fear factor comes along and they're 

475
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,080
like,
hey,

476
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,171
we're going to give you all this money 
every week and only have to do is just 

477
00:19:02,171 --> 00:19:04,100
show up and watch people do stupid shit.
You're like,

478
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,930
fuck,
it's so easy to get that money.

479
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,870
It's so difficult,
but you have got a pass on it.

480
00:19:08,871 --> 00:19:11,540
You really do.
Because if it was good that I did it,

481
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,840
but at a certain point in time you have 
to pass on doing those things because if

482
00:19:14,841 --> 00:19:16,640
you don't,
you're just going to be better.

483
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:17,940
You're talking about,
by the way,

484
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:21,390
you're talking about old TV while you 
while you're doing new TV.

485
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,190
Yeah.

486
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,120
This is way easier.
This look,

487
00:19:25,121 --> 00:19:27,940
we could have never had a fucking show 
like this that reaches as many people as

488
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:29,530
this thing does.
Including the,

489
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,730
um,
you know,

490
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,240
the podcast on itunes and this thing on 
ustream and there's,

491
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:40,270
there's no fucking way we could have 
ever gotten someone to agree to let us 

492
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,100
practice a TV show.
This is what we're gonna do.

493
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,940
We're gonna start off just fucking 
around with boxes of shit behind me,

494
00:19:45,941 --> 00:19:50,941
piled up on the desk and that eventually
we're going to move on to like try to 

495
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:52,480
have like a real show,
like a desk and real microphones and the

496
00:19:52,481 --> 00:19:55,340
sound is much better.
We got to like a top end MP,

497
00:19:55,341 --> 00:19:58,240
three recorder and then the next thing 
we got ustream producer.

498
00:19:58,241 --> 00:20:03,241
We're going to have high def cameras in 
here and eventually we're going to 

499
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:05,731
figure out how to do it all through a 
tri caster so that we can have a 

500
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:05,770
background and we'll put a green screen 
up behind us.

501
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,890
We never thought that this was going to 
happen.

502
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,640
This is just a goof and and this.
This is not that.

503
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:13,720
This is any big deal like this could 
have happened,

504
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,290
but it's this easy and this fun and 
people would enjoy this much.

505
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:22,530
You could never.
I could have never done this on 

506
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:22,530
television.
They would've never let me,

507
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,680
and if they did,
they would never let me just do it the 

508
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:25,680
way we did it.
Just wing it and talk about whatever.

509
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:30,150
For the first fucking 10 weeks we didn't
even have plan what we're going to talk 

510
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,000
about.
We would just get in there,

511
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:33,280
turn it on and just talk about it,
you know.

512
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,090
So I completely lost what the fuck I was
talking about.

513
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,710
I completely lost what I was saying.
My.

514
00:20:38,711 --> 00:20:43,711
I know what my point is.
My point is that this is new TV and 

515
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:46,780
you're right and it protects me really 
if I do something like the flashlight or

516
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:52,140
any of the ridiculous should I do it 
protects me from doing any dumb fear 

517
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:52,240
factor type shit in the future.

518
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,320
It's so funny because there is a pretty 
direct line on the old TV where the new 

519
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,611
tvs mixing with the old TV right now.
I was watching family guy and the 

520
00:21:01,611 --> 00:21:05,901
episode involved at dog licking out a 
baby's asshole,

521
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,090
but it was on the last episode had that,
uh,

522
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:15,170
were Brian.
The dog ate out steelies asshole and 

523
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:15,270
cleaned shit office as,
how's that?

524
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:20,160
And we're talking about masturbating,
having a problem with masturbating.

525
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,410
Wow.
That's incredible.

526
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:23,570
I have to see that episode,
Dude.

527
00:21:23,571 --> 00:21:26,940
It's the best episode download last 
episode of family guy.

528
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,910
They're trapped in a bank,
a bank vault or something like that,

529
00:21:29,911 --> 00:21:34,911
and it is so fucking ridiculous.
The shit that they get away with 

530
00:21:34,911 --> 00:21:37,530
unregular primetime television and we're
talking about fucking at rubber.

531
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:40,810
Your,
uh,

532
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,990
as successful as they are or successful 
south park is,

533
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:49,140
you basically can do whatever the fuck 
you want because people want to be on 

534
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,140
your show,
you know,

535
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,820
advertisers rather,
right?

536
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,390
They want to advertise on your show and 
your show is gigantic.

537
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:57,391
South Park has just got such all loyal 
Legion of followers at this point in 

538
00:21:57,391 --> 00:22:01,411
time until the Mohammed thing.
They've pretty much got away with doing 

539
00:22:01,411 --> 00:22:01,630
like almost anything they wanted for a 
long time.

540
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:06,680
That's crazy about the Mohammed that 
mean because in New York City they just 

541
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,831
captured that guy,
that bomber and there's a connection 

542
00:22:09,831 --> 00:22:13,160
that people are starting to make between
a Republican senator or something like 

543
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,160
that said that they,
uh,

544
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,880
I think there might be a connection 
between the two,

545
00:22:14,881 --> 00:22:16,530
but they haven't proved anything yet.

546
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,520
Well,
you know,

547
00:22:17,521 --> 00:22:22,521
I mean,
that's a good thing to speculate 

548
00:22:22,521 --> 00:22:24,260
automatically that be a connection.
But you know who the fuck knows yoder 

549
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:24,260
was,
man,

550
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,010
what if listen man,
people,

551
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:31,040
people are that dumb.
There are people that really do believe 

552
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,250
that you're not supposed to make fun of 
them at all and if you do,

553
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:34,860
you're supposed to die like that.
They are the.

554
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,590
That's the worst example of human beings
in the world.

555
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:42,860
And the problem with the Middle East,
and this is what I've always talked 

556
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,291
about,
I've talked about it as a joke in my 

557
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:45,291
act,
but it really is kind of true.

558
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:48,090
One of the reasons why the there,
there are so arcane in their ways.

559
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:53,150
We don't try and adjust the sound.
One of the reasons why there are so 

560
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,350
arcane in their ways is that that's 
where culture like began.

561
00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:00,530
The oldest known civilization that we 
know of is Sumir and that's where Iraq 

562
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:00,530
is.

563
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:05,450
So basically like the people that are 
still in that area or like the townies 

564
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:05,450
of the world.
I mean,

565
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:10,251
they're really stuck on some fucking 
multifamily hundred year old trip and us

566
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:13,110
being in America,
and it's not that America is better than

567
00:23:13,111 --> 00:23:18,111
other countries,
but the one advantage that America has 

568
00:23:18,111 --> 00:23:20,910
as it were the most recent country,
so we're all from somewhere that sucked.

569
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:26,180
Every one of us here is we came from 
somewhere that sucked or answer says 

570
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:31,011
came from somewhere that suck and they 
congregate it to this one place to get 

571
00:23:31,011 --> 00:23:34,491
the most fresh idea supposedly to be the
most progressive because they're at the 

572
00:23:34,491 --> 00:23:37,680
furthest ahead of the curve,
but people in like the Middle East,

573
00:23:37,681 --> 00:23:41,070
that's the furthest.
That's the beginning point of the curve.

574
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:46,130
Like do they really are the fucking 
townies of the world and that's why the 

575
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:50,231
problem with this fucking cartoon thing 
is that these motherfuckers really do 

576
00:23:50,231 --> 00:23:53,450
believe that there's some magical 
motherfucker that you're not supposed to

577
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:53,960
draw.

578
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:54,910
I mean,
it's,

579
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:59,950
it's bananas.
You know that that is the enemy of 

580
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:01,550
evolution.
This ancient ideology,

581
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:06,551
this multipurpose fucking ridiculous 
idea that somehow or another several 

582
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,500
thousand years ago,
they had it wired.

583
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,680
They hadn't figured out back then,
even though they didn't know Jack Shit 

584
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,400
about medicine,
about the constellations.

585
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:18,650
They didn't know anything,
but they had it wired.

586
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,460
They.
They knew.

587
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,790
They knew what was going on.
What the fuck are you talking about?

588
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:28,150
It's ridiculous.
The fact that there's people willing to 

589
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:31,091
die for that,
that in 2010 that is still rocking.

590
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,130
It is amazing.
It's amazing.

591
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,050
Yeah.
Tom Cruise was the same way to do.

592
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:43,190
Personally.
I think that the scariest thing is not 

593
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,140
even the Middle East.
I don't think the scariest thing in this

594
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:48,170
world is that ideology.
I think that's very scary,

595
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:53,350
but to me what's scarier is what's 
happening in Mexico and the fact that 

596
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:57,250
Mexico is connected to us and Mexico is 
the middle of gigantic gang wars between

597
00:24:57,531 --> 00:25:02,531
the police and these gang cartels that 
have fucking billions of dollars.

598
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:07,400
These guys have insane amounts of money 
because that's the only way you can make

599
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:08,740
money.
So it's basically like.

600
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:14,220
I mean,
that's not the only way you can make 

601
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:14,220
money in Mexico.
So I what I'm saying,

602
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:14,220
I'm saying,
you know,

603
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,920
they're totally illegal to sell cocaine.
It has to be sold illegal.

604
00:25:15,921 --> 00:25:18,800
You can't sell it legally.
You can't regulate it and tax it.

605
00:25:18,801 --> 00:25:21,230
You can't do anything with it.
You have to sell it illegally.

606
00:25:21,231 --> 00:25:24,110
So people are going to buy cocaine,
they're going to buy cocaine from Mexico

607
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:25,400
and there's,
someone's going to get that money.

608
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:30,490
Who the fuck's going to get that money?
Will these drug lords have all that 

609
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,150
money and now they're more powerful than
the police and they've got US troops are

610
00:25:32,151 --> 00:25:33,890
going in there now and fucking helping 
out.

611
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,480
I mean,
it's bananas down there,

612
00:25:35,481 --> 00:25:37,940
Dude.
There's fucking ward in the streets with

613
00:25:37,941 --> 00:25:41,030
tanks with bananas and people are still 
going there for vacations.

614
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:46,260
It's like the last spring break that was
still one of the hotspots for people to 

615
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,200
go for spring break.
If they were Muslims,

616
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:49,520
we'd be fucked.
Okay.

617
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,120
The fact that they're Christians and 
then on into blown themselves up for,

618
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,170
you know,
for Jesus,

619
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:54,860
they're,
they're,

620
00:25:54,861 --> 00:25:56,090
they're into,
you know,

621
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,560
I mean what's going on is it's a lot of 
money and a lot of influence and a lot 

622
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:06,281
of people that get illegal money and 
they're dominating the actual political 

623
00:26:06,281 --> 00:26:08,000
system over there and as many as they 
try to raid,

624
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:13,090
there's so many more of them.
It's such a fucking hard fight because 

625
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:13,670
they let them like,
dig in and get infested.

626
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:18,910
There's so many fucking gigantic cartels
with just tons and tons of money and 

627
00:26:19,131 --> 00:26:20,810
guns.
It's so frightening.

628
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,060
But if they like,
if they were the enemy,

629
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:25,880
if that was Muslim,
I mean if like,

630
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:29,420
if like Pakistan was right next door to 
us and this shit was going down,

631
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,470
it would be even scarier.

632
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:35,830
You know?
It really would because for some reason 

633
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:35,990
the Mexicans aren't blaming the 
Americans.

634
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:41,410
It's really interesting.
It's like Mexican people are pretty 

635
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:44,010
proud people and now they're not blaming
a lot of family here and that's fine.

636
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,630
They're not going to fuck with half of 
their families.

637
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,380
It's also,
I mean it's really clear what happened.

638
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,910
They want to.
Mexico wanted to make drugs illegal,

639
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:56,060
they wanted to decriminalize it and make
them legal and make it so that people 

640
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,830
can sell them and tax and mental and the
United States said no fucking way,

641
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:04,090
like no way and if you don't have laws 
and you know you were involved in a 

642
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:09,021
business like selling drugs,
you're going to have criminals because 

643
00:27:09,021 --> 00:27:12,171
even when you have laws,
we have things like pharmaceutical 

644
00:27:12,171 --> 00:27:15,171
companies.
Pharmaceutical companies are basically 

645
00:27:15,171 --> 00:27:17,361
legal drug dealers and they're dealing 
shit that kills motherfuckers every day.

646
00:27:17,581 --> 00:27:21,900
There's always people dropping off from 
vicodin and percocet.

647
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,080
I remember when I got my nose fixed,
when I got my deviated septum operated 

648
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,520
on,
the good doctor gave me to a value.

649
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,120
No,
it was a,

650
00:27:29,121 --> 00:27:32,820
a vicodin and percocet.
He gave me a prescription for both and I

651
00:27:32,821 --> 00:27:33,810
looked at him like,
man,

652
00:27:33,811 --> 00:27:38,811
this stuff is bad for you.
Like how bad is this going to fucking 

653
00:27:38,811 --> 00:27:41,751
hurt?
It's going to hurt way more than it 

654
00:27:41,751 --> 00:27:43,311
hurts right now.
Like I'd rather just deal with it being 

655
00:27:43,311 --> 00:27:45,981
annoying.
Then get hooked on some crazy fucking 

656
00:27:45,981 --> 00:27:46,470
pharmaceutical pills that like an 
addict.

657
00:27:46,471 --> 00:27:48,750
You like what?
Like 30 percent of the time.

658
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:53,840
How many people get addicted to Vicodin?
Like did they think of those things out 

659
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,570
like candy?
Well,

660
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:57,540
right after I decided not to accept the 
prescription.

661
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,720
A study came out showing that the FDA 
food and Drug Administration so was 

662
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,130
there.
They're going to recommend like cutting 

663
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:09,660
way back on prescriptions and they like 
recommend that doctors did not prescribe

664
00:28:09,661 --> 00:28:14,661
them because of liver damage and because
of addiction I have probably for half 

665
00:28:14,661 --> 00:28:16,590
full bottles of magnum laying around 
just from going to the dentist.

666
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:22,850
They talked to you sometimes.
Do they talk to you that vitamin 

667
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:22,850
bottles?
Only when I sleep,

668
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:25,320
like in the middle of the night I wake 
up and you're combing my hair and go,

669
00:28:25,321 --> 00:28:26,690
Geez,
you really stressed right now.

670
00:28:26,691 --> 00:28:28,630
You feel better.
Actually I hate Mike.

671
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:29,850
Shoe me up,
man.

672
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,530
I hate fighting.
I hate feeling.

673
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:36,480
I just feel gross when I do like it and 
I've only done vicodin once.

674
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,990
When I had my first knee operation,
I've had three knee operations,

675
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:43,230
two acl reconstructions,
one meniscus surgery,

676
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:47,100
and uh,
the first time I had the acl done it was

677
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:50,160
pretty painful because they did what's 
called a Patella tendon graft,

678
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:54,960
a scar that goes from here to here.
And what they do is they take a chunk of

679
00:28:54,961 --> 00:28:59,961
bone out of your knee and a chunk of 
bone out of your Shin and they cut this 

680
00:28:59,961 --> 00:29:00,030
big tendon.
This is one of the,

681
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:05,150
they cut a slice of it off with the bone
and then they open you up like a fish 

682
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,810
and they drill it in place.

683
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:11,550
So they take this tendon and they make 
it smaller to make you a fake tendon for

684
00:29:11,551 --> 00:29:16,551
the acl.
And it's apparently it was supposedly 

685
00:29:16,551 --> 00:29:16,551
like physically stronger than the 
original acl.

686
00:29:16,551 --> 00:29:21,130
But the point is you're,
you got holes in your bones and screws 

687
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,410
and your bones and it hurts like a bitch
when you get up,

688
00:29:22,411 --> 00:29:24,450
especially when you're sitting down and 
then you get up.

689
00:29:24,451 --> 00:29:29,451
It's way more pain.
I have the other one done with a 

690
00:29:29,451 --> 00:29:29,451
cadaver,
so I got a dead dudes.

691
00:29:29,451 --> 00:29:33,501
Shit in this knee,
but the one with the acl where they do 

692
00:29:33,501 --> 00:29:34,590
the surgery with the ticket off the bone
is way,

693
00:29:34,591 --> 00:29:36,330
way,
way more painful.

694
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:41,510
You get up from the couch and be like 
watching TV and it was just like hot 

695
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,050
lava,
just hot lead.

696
00:29:42,051 --> 00:29:47,051
Just going right into my bones.
It was so fucking painful and I took a 

697
00:29:47,141 --> 00:29:52,141
vicodin.
That was the only time I ever took one 

698
00:29:52,141 --> 00:29:52,141
and I felt so stupid.
Yeah,

699
00:29:52,141 --> 00:29:56,130
just so drugged and my jaw was slack and
I was watching TV and I thought to 

700
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:58,060
myself while it was under it,
I was like,

701
00:29:58,061 --> 00:30:01,560
I will never take this dumb shit again.
This stuff's terrible.

702
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:01,990
Yeah,

703
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,030
so we'd have some people are the exact 
opposite.

704
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,300
They'll give you 20 bucks for awakening.
Well,

705
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:11,060
W w what basically we're trying to say 
is there's no fucking difference between

706
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:16,270
vicodins inheritance.
Heroin and Oxycontin and heroin are 

707
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:20,110
really the same thing.
There's no fucking difference between 

708
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:20,110
pharmaceutical companies and drug 
dealers.

709
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,700
The only difference is that drug dealers
don't have to.

710
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,670
They don't have to work within the law.
The pharmaceutical companies,

711
00:30:25,671 --> 00:30:27,950
they have to bribe politicians.
They have to.

712
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:31,040
They have to wax doctors,
you know what to do with doctors.

713
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:34,250
They take everybody out to dinner.
Mrs Rogan is,

714
00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:37,520
her mom is a nurse and I'm the.
She's a.

715
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,200
She works with these pharmaceutical 
companies,

716
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:44,380
these nurses,
they don't make much money and they 

717
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,541
don't get to go out to fancy dinners 
where the pharmaceutical companies come 

718
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:46,541
along and say,
hey,

719
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:50,321
Viagara is going to take us out on a 
nice dinner and they all get to go to a 

720
00:30:50,321 --> 00:30:53,291
nice restaurant and have a nice meal and
it's all on these pharmaceutical 

721
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:53,291
companies.
They pay for the drinks,

722
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:58,181
they pay for everything and so these 
people are more likely to talk nice 

723
00:30:58,181 --> 00:30:59,480
about their pharmaceuticals,
so they prescribe them more.

724
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:04,560
You know what's fucked up about that is 
I've thought about that also when I go 

725
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,140
to the doc.
The other is that the doctor review.

726
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,820
It was a poor example because that's a 
good one.

727
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,950
Right.
I went to the doctor's the other day for

728
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:12,580
acid reflux because sometimes after eat 
like too much caffeine,

729
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:17,610
onions or a drink too much.
I kind of have feel like an acid coming 

730
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:21,331
up from my throat.
It makes my throat feel tight and all 

731
00:31:21,331 --> 00:31:21,331
this other stuff.
I had this for a long time.

732
00:31:21,331 --> 00:31:22,680
I've had it for a while,
so finally went to the doctor,

733
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:25,480
the ODA digestive doctor,
and I told him everything I had and then

734
00:31:25,481 --> 00:31:25,900
he's like,
oh,

735
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:28,600
let me give you some samples.
He gave me a garbage bag,

736
00:31:28,601 --> 00:31:31,810
almost full of the sample was called the
blue pill.com.

737
00:31:31,811 --> 00:31:34,030
I don't remember what the name of it,
but was the blue pill.com

738
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:34,700
or something that.

739
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,640
And I'm thinking,
you know what,

740
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:41,641
I wonder if this is even the best thing 
I could be taking right now or if this 

741
00:31:41,641 --> 00:31:46,411
guy just got paid to get me a bottle and
because he gave me like 20 bottles of 

742
00:31:46,411 --> 00:31:49,010
samples and coupons and books and it's 
like.

743
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,770
And I,
I take it and I'm like,

744
00:31:50,771 --> 00:31:52,720
yeah,
I guess that kind of is better,

745
00:31:52,721 --> 00:31:55,810
but I don't know if I'm just tricking 
myself or if I have to go back there,

746
00:31:55,811 --> 00:31:57,190
make a second appointment,
you know,

747
00:31:57,191 --> 00:31:57,910
just to be like,
look,

748
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,830
whatever you gave me,
that's bullshit.

749
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:03,620
We know for sure the doctors are 
influenced by pharmaceutical.

750
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,690
You know,
they give them money,

751
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,820
they get money for.
They were getting,

752
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:12,830
I don't know if it's still true,
it's still legal in or if there's 

753
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,490
different states have different laws.
I don't know how it all works,

754
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,640
but from what I understand,
doctors have been busted where they're 

755
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,330
getting a percentage of the amount of 
sales that they have.

756
00:32:20,331 --> 00:32:21,240
Like say if they sell,
you know,

757
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:26,290
x amount of volumes,
they get a kickback from the 

758
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,330
pharmaceutical company.
That should absolutely be illegal.

759
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:28,120
I mean that's

760
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:33,400
crazy.
And that's what an analyst that's 

761
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,491
hopefully technology helps that done.
So when they tried to prescribe 

762
00:32:34,491 --> 00:32:35,280
something like a million topics come 
from text to your phone and you go,

763
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,110
actually no,
I want to take this one.

764
00:32:37,111 --> 00:32:39,060
This one's better,
you know like yeah,

765
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,210
an iphone apps.

766
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:45,220
It tells you,
your doctors trying to get you to turn 

767
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:45,220
it,
you turned it on and when the doctor not

768
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,270
trying to shit on doctors anything,
then that's.

769
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:52,330
The whole system is fucked up.
And when you're a doctor and you're 

770
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:55,211
struggling to get along and you have to 
pay an insane amount of malpractice 

771
00:32:55,211 --> 00:32:58,631
insurance,
malpractice insurance for doctors has 

772
00:32:58,631 --> 00:33:01,141
goddamn brutal.
And then you have all these assholes 

773
00:33:01,141 --> 00:33:01,141
that want to sue you for fucking 
nothing,

774
00:33:01,141 --> 00:33:03,020
for no reason for shit getting wrong,
for you.

775
00:33:03,021 --> 00:33:05,540
Getting an affection for things that are
totally unavoidable.

776
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,970
And I'm not saying the doctors perfect,
but you know,

777
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
it's hard for doctors,
their medical bills or fucking or 

778
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,550
medical school bills are gigantic.
They're fucking huge.

779
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,760
And then all of a sudden some 
pharmaceutical company comes along and 

780
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:18,760
says,
Hey,

781
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:18,760
you know,
you're,

782
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,540
you're still helping all these people.
You're still doing great thing.

783
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:23,240
We just would love it if you would tell 
them,

784
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,610
you know,
Take Vioxx if you have arthritis.

785
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,200
So these doctors say,
yeah,

786
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:28,260
I could do that and we'll,
we'll,

787
00:33:28,261 --> 00:33:31,310
we'll be in on a deal with you guys.
You can buy it,

788
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:36,350
you know,
we'll give you a share in the company 

789
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:36,650
will give you a certain percentage for 
every Vioxx bottle you sell.

790
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:41,651
We'll give you x percent.
And so they don't think they're doing 

791
00:33:41,651 --> 00:33:44,351
anything wrong.
Vioxx is something that was created to 

792
00:33:44,351 --> 00:33:44,351
help people.
This person has a pain,

793
00:33:44,351 --> 00:33:46,200
I'll give them this,
it'll help their pain and I'll profit in

794
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:48,050
it and they don't even think it's a bad 
thing.

795
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:53,470
And then next thing you know that 
they're prescribing it way more than 

796
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,841
they did before,
especially like nutty pills or you talk 

797
00:33:55,841 --> 00:33:56,420
to like there's been many studies done 
on people who take on to have a presence

798
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,530
and how,
uh,

799
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:02,980
people have gone to a psychiatrist just 
for experimentation purposes just to 

800
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,400
write stories on it and just said,
hey,

801
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:05,960
you know,
I'm just having trouble sleeping.

802
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,900
I feel shitty all day.
I don't know what to do here.

803
00:34:08,901 --> 00:34:09,980
Take this.
Bam.

804
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,470
It's like that simple of Zoloft and 
you'll feel better,

805
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,180
right?
Like they're just dishing it out.

806
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,310
Try this for a little bit and tell us 
how you feel like,

807
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:21,370
Whoa,
we're fucking with human neurochemistry 

808
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:22,700
and we're allowing these heartless 
pharmaceutical companies to do it.

809
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,380
You can't do that,
man.

810
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:29,410
There's got to be more oversight.
I know there's a lot of money in 

811
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:32,110
involved in pharmaceuticals and I know 
that there's a lot of pharmaceuticals 

812
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:32,110
that do a lot of good for a lot of 
people.

813
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,140
Not saying there's anything bad about 
it,

814
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:38,350
but there's got to be way more oversight
because they have so much shit out there

815
00:34:38,811 --> 00:34:43,760
that you can get addicted to.
There's so much that will fuck your life

816
00:34:43,761 --> 00:34:48,761
up and it's readily available.
Oxycontin's fucking percosets.

817
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,130
Volume's vicodins.

818
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:57,160
Those,
those fucking things will crush you and 

819
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,270
somehow or another,
those guys are doing something that's 

820
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:04,510
way more acceptable than some of 
themselves.

821
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:09,550
Pot or coke or Fox or rubber or vagina 
or vagina looked at as heroes,

822
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:16,121
doctors and staff,
but yet if you talk about this book,

823
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,720
doctors are heroes.
Man,

824
00:35:17,721 --> 00:35:20,390
the doctors at a fixed me up,
I'm in forever in their debt.

825
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:23,390
The guy who fixed my nose,
the guys who fixed my knees,

826
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,700
you know,
if it wasn't for them,

827
00:35:24,701 --> 00:35:26,960
I knows what suck and I wouldn't be able
to walk that good.

828
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,790
You know what I mean?
Doctors are fucking awesome.

829
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:33,791
I'm not saying that.
I'm just saying we live in this 

830
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:36,641
ridiculous state of a poc resy because 
there's certain drugs that we make 

831
00:35:36,641 --> 00:35:39,000
illegal.
You aren't supposed to have them.

832
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,900
It's not that you can get them 
prescribed if you need them or they can,

833
00:35:42,901 --> 00:35:43,470
you know,
monitor,

834
00:35:43,471 --> 00:35:45,120
you know you're not allowed to.

835
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:49,350
Big Daddy who knows more than you,
tells you that if you're with this drug,

836
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:54,500
this drug,
we're going to lock you in a cage like 

837
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:54,500
what the fuck?
Why is that?

838
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,641
Is that set up so that the people who 
really appreciate and recognize the 

839
00:35:58,801 --> 00:36:03,801
merits and the psychedelic drugs rise up
so that they realize they have to 

840
00:36:03,801 --> 00:36:05,640
literally overthrow the,
the culture,

841
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,830
the way of thinking.
They have to not overthrow rather,

842
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:12,831
but overturn the way,
the way the culture accepts drugs 

843
00:36:12,831 --> 00:36:14,230
because that's the only thing that seems
to make sense.

844
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:19,280
All the beneficial ones are illegal.
You don't ever hear about someone 

845
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:19,700
talking to you about they did value them
and they.

846
00:36:19,701 --> 00:36:23,220
They just really had this life changing 
experience and learn to love everyone.

847
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,290
No,
you don't have that fucking on valium.

848
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:28,980
I felt connected to the universe and I 
realized that I'm just a part of a never

849
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:32,280
ending process in my biology is trying 
to hold onto everything and that's where

850
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:33,330
the insecurity comes from.

851
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,410
You know?
No,

852
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,600
you don't get that from fucking value.
Okay.

853
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,950
You get that from mushrooms and 
mushrooms grow outside and if they catch

854
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:42,900
you with them,
they put you in a cage.

855
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:48,050
If they come by your fucking house and 
you have mushrooms growing on your car 

856
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:48,120
under your tree,
in your backyard,

857
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:51,240
they are legally allowed to lock you in 
a box.

858
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:56,510
They can take you and arrest you.
That's fucking bananas.

859
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:01,970
Bananas and that are enforcing our 
ridiculous thinking on the Mexican 

860
00:37:02,641 --> 00:37:05,670
people is why those drug cartels got 
into power.

861
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:11,150
Is that a conspiracy theory perhaps?
Is that a little bit of Tinfoil hat 

862
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:11,150
perhaps?
Yeah,

863
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:11,610
maybe,
but you know,

864
00:37:11,611 --> 00:37:13,640
some of that tin foil hat shit is on the
money and I,

865
00:37:13,641 --> 00:37:18,641
I think it is with this,
we're live right next to a country 

866
00:37:18,641 --> 00:37:22,400
that's involved in a way more deadly war
than the one going on in Afghanistan or 

867
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:22,400
going on in Iraq.

868
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:27,710
Both of them combined.
Can't even touch the body counts that 

869
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,460
are happening in Mexico right next door.
They're killing motherfuckers.

870
00:37:29,461 --> 00:37:31,230
They're going crazy over there,
dude,

871
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,250
and you can get there by walking.
You know what I'm saying?

872
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:40,430
I mean,
we're all invested in Afghanistan and 

873
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:40,430
securing Afghanistan.
Meanwhile,

874
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:44,010
we live right next to a fucking third 
world country.

875
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:49,011
We are connected to them with an 
invisible line and they're involved in 

876
00:37:49,011 --> 00:37:53,121
the bloodiest pharmaceutical war that's 
ever been fought in the history of this 

877
00:37:53,121 --> 00:37:54,870
earth,
the illegal pharmaceutical war.

878
00:37:55,050 --> 00:38:00,050
They're finding it with God damn tanks.
They're fighting a pharmaceutical war 

879
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:02,210
with tanks and that's what the war is 
the worst.

880
00:38:02,211 --> 00:38:07,211
Who gets to sell your shit?
Is it going to be people that have no 

881
00:38:07,211 --> 00:38:10,941
law whatsoever or is it going to be 
people that have laws and if you say 

882
00:38:10,941 --> 00:38:12,690
it's going to be people that have laws 
and that the other stuff,

883
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:17,691
you're not going to allow,
well then someone's gonna sell that 

884
00:38:17,691 --> 00:38:17,691
other stuff cause he's a goddamn demand 
for it.

885
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,050
It sits dangerous everywhere that.
Did you hear about this?

886
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,900
A West Hollywood like yesterday or 
something like that.

887
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:25,690
A woman walks into target at West 
Hollywood.

888
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:28,510
I just started fucking stabbing or 
shooting people,

889
00:38:28,511 --> 00:38:33,511
I think shooting people,
shop for people and finally was taken 

890
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:34,180
down by you.
Got to do a google.

891
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:40,750
This is the age of the Internet side.
You can't be used in like 1984 type 

892
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,700
storytelling skills.
We'll give you a why look us up,

893
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:47,701
give some facts about target.
Target is an awesome place if you want 

894
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:48,760
to buy some shit and they usually have 
it there.

895
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,460
However,
target will not carry the rubber pussy.

896
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:57,090
No target frowns upon the rubber pussy.
They're not stabs for people in a so it 

897
00:38:58,801 --> 00:39:00,970
is stabbing in West Hollywood.
Uh,

898
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:03,580
she's 34 years old.
Enter the store.

899
00:39:03,581 --> 00:39:07,450
Attack shoppers with a butcher knife,
a steak knife and off duty.

900
00:39:07,451 --> 00:39:12,451
La County Sheriff,
deputy and store security guards 

901
00:39:12,451 --> 00:39:12,451
apprehended her.

902
00:39:12,451 --> 00:39:14,450
Thank God those guys were there.
Thank God someone so fucking balls.

903
00:39:14,451 --> 00:39:17,090
I hope they brain that bitch.
When they took her out,

904
00:39:17,091 --> 00:39:19,490
they should have just shoved that 
fucking knife right into our heart.

905
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,620
You know,
you're in the middle of a battle,

906
00:39:21,621 --> 00:39:24,170
a knife battle with a knife wielding 
assailant.

907
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,720
You should just stick that fucking thing
right in neck.

908
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,020
Wow.

909
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,570
She was yelling,
I'm bipolar.

910
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,670
There's no witness protection program.

911
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,560
Oh God.
See?

912
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:36,140
At that point we have to know when to 
kill people.

913
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:41,170
We really do.
You can't bring that person back and 

914
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,021
reintroduce them to society.
This life is short and you have fucked 

915
00:39:44,021 --> 00:39:48,281
it up so bad.
There's just no way of coming back from 

916
00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:49,490
that.
We just got to start from scratch and it

917
00:39:49,491 --> 00:39:52,520
sends a message to all the other people 
out there thinking about going nutty.

918
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,590
Don't go that nutty.
All right.

919
00:39:54,591 --> 00:39:59,591
Stop.
They'll go running into target and 

920
00:39:59,591 --> 00:39:59,591
fucking stabbing people.
We're not going to allow that shit.

921
00:39:59,591 --> 00:40:01,670
Jesus Christ,
you know,

922
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:05,630
we're so goddamn tolerant of fucking 
loonies to kill him.

923
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,270
Yeah.
Have you seen those back?

924
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:13,360
I think I talked about this,
talked about it the other day when we 

925
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:13,360
were talking to the fleshlight dude does
it the new,

926
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,110
the new,
uh,

927
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,060
piercings where they have a up and down 
your back.

928
00:40:17,061 --> 00:40:20,360
They have hoops and then they take laces
and go back and forth,

929
00:40:20,361 --> 00:40:23,840
like it's a dress and I tie bows and 
stuff with it.

930
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,150
I was thinking,
you know how fucking crazy is that?

931
00:40:26,151 --> 00:40:31,151
Even piercings are crazy.
I remember back in the day it was left 

932
00:40:31,151 --> 00:40:31,151
hoop,
right hoop,

933
00:40:31,151 --> 00:40:35,860
you know,
that was the whigs and one eyebrow 

934
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:39,310
eyebrow eyebrow.
And it moved on the belly button and 

935
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,610
then like some crazy girls got nipples 
and clits.

936
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:43,340
Now they're fucking making clothes out 
of your skin.

937
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,410
I think you should probably talk to that
microphone more.

938
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,590
Put the pumped up.
Pick it up.

939
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:52,630
Yeah,
but it's getting to the point where now 

940
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:52,630
it's like like laces back and forth and 
like you're.

941
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:55,420
You're making skin dresses.
That's how crazy piercing is.

942
00:40:55,470 --> 00:41:00,470
Yeah.
What he's talking about as a series of 

943
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,571
loops that these women are putting on 
their bodies and their back and they 

944
00:41:02,571 --> 00:41:03,230
make it like shoelaces.
Yeah.

945
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,310
Fucking.
It's the trippiest thing ever.

946
00:41:05,311 --> 00:41:07,620
When you see someone that's a girl 
doesn't give a fuck,

947
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:08,460
right?
Yeah.

948
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:11,160
There was a blank.
If you fuck her in the ass,

949
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,000
she'll be like,
what?

950
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:16,800
There was a girl standing outside of my 
grocery store trying to do Greenpeace,

951
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:21,900
whatever that shit is because she had 
that whole thing up and down with a bra 

952
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:21,900
on.
Do you

953
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,240
think that that's the message that the 
message is that they're just.

954
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:29,390
They can take all sorts of crazy pain.
That's the sexiness of the message that 

955
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:31,350
our people are just getting weird about 
skin.

956
00:41:31,351 --> 00:41:32,850
Yeah,
but does that maybe the sexiness of the.

957
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,370
What it is,
is that you know,

958
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:39,430
what you're doing is you're taking a 
lust to the next level because 

959
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:43,391
everything has got to go to the next 
level now because we have this crazy 

960
00:41:43,391 --> 00:41:43,391
access to information,
you know,

961
00:41:43,391 --> 00:41:45,050
like people are fucking way different 
than they fucked.

962
00:41:45,051 --> 00:41:47,400
Like in the 19 seventies,
you know,

963
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:49,080
no one is accepting,
you know,

964
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,130
lights out,
you know,

965
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:53,090
just fucking and no,
no dirty talk.

966
00:41:53,091 --> 00:41:56,360
No nothing.
Missionary Style Rollover Kiska and I go

967
00:41:56,361 --> 00:42:01,361
to sleep.
No one is accepting that everyone's 

968
00:42:01,361 --> 00:42:03,250
going [inaudible] style and this is all 
because of the Internet because 

969
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:06,371
pornography has changed the way people 
look at sex and you know what they're 

970
00:42:06,371 --> 00:42:06,371
talking about.

971
00:42:06,371 --> 00:42:08,180
A lot of people are talking about 
there's a problem with young girls right

972
00:42:08,181 --> 00:42:11,710
now getting all sorts of problems with 
their bubbles because they're having but

973
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,580
sex like,
hey,

974
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,330
early and all the time.
Yeah,

975
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:19,450
there's going to be a lot of 30 year old
women in a couple years from now with 

976
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:19,450
that.
Yeah.

977
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:21,770
The diapers on and that's gonna be the 
fashion I fastened with your pamper.

978
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:22,760
Oh my God.
No,

979
00:42:22,761 --> 00:42:27,761
you know it's going to be.
The big operation is not going to be 

980
00:42:27,761 --> 00:42:30,311
botox.
It's going to be getting your butthole 

981
00:42:30,311 --> 00:42:31,890
tightening,
get your butthole brought back to 

982
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:34,031
reality and like a filter for awhile.
You're going to have to use a colostomy 

983
00:42:34,031 --> 00:42:37,361
bag for a little while until your 
butthole gets recovered from the 

984
00:42:37,361 --> 00:42:37,361
surgery.
That's Shit's real,

985
00:42:37,361 --> 00:42:37,361
man.
That's.

986
00:42:37,361 --> 00:42:39,360
That's one of these people doing.
They're their.

987
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,770
You know what they're doing.
They're there.

988
00:42:40,771 --> 00:42:41,940
They're getting there.

989
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:44,900
They're getting everything to the 
highest level possible.

990
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,840
That's what these piercings are about.
That's what guys think.

991
00:42:47,841 --> 00:42:51,620
Girls who were tattooed up or sexy,
what's sexy about tattoos?

992
00:42:51,621 --> 00:42:56,621
If you have tattoos,
you know how much fucking pain it 

993
00:42:56,621 --> 00:42:56,621
causes.
It's so God damn painful,

994
00:42:56,621 --> 00:42:57,970
so you see someone with tattoos,
you're like,

995
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,620
that's someone who doesn't give a fuck,
you know,

996
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:03,080
and that's the sexiness of it,
but shit,

997
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,270
we're word bananas,
man.

998
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,280
Our society is going in a very,
very,

999
00:43:07,281 --> 00:43:08,750
very,
very strange direction.

1000
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,630
Oh,
that's ridiculous.

1001
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:14,750
It's the,
the age of information is not 

1002
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:18,491
necessarily aiding it entirely because 
people aren't necessarily using the 

1003
00:43:18,491 --> 00:43:20,570
information on the Internet to make an 
objective opinion.

1004
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:25,690
They're usually trying to find stuff 
that reinforces their own current 

1005
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:26,060
opinion.
It's a very tempting thing.

1006
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,380
You know,
you've got to look at like,

1007
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,080
like w with ideas in the Internet.
You got to look at both sides of it,

1008
00:43:30,081 --> 00:43:31,100
but a lot of people aren't.

1009
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:36,190
So it's like almost helping retards be 
retarded if they can find other sites 

1010
00:43:36,231 --> 00:43:38,930
that say the earth is flat and dinosaurs
lived with people 6,000

1011
00:43:38,931 --> 00:43:40,040
years ago,
as long as you can.

1012
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:45,430
You can find plenty of sites.
If you look around and tells you that 

1013
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:48,671
evolution is retarded,
you could have plenty of science that 

1014
00:43:48,671 --> 00:43:51,371
we'll have guys who are doctors and 
they're scientists and they are telling 

1015
00:43:51,371 --> 00:43:56,050
me they're obviously crazy,
but they're telling people that the 

1016
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:59,051
earth is only 6,000
years old and carbon dating is not real 

1017
00:43:59,051 --> 00:43:59,870
and that evolution is a myth and that,
you know,

1018
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:03,080
we had to come from somewhere so there 
has to be a god and that,

1019
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,310
you know,
the Bible is,

1020
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:09,360
you know,
can prove the Bible mathematically and 

1021
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:09,920
they start talking talk and these are 
doctors and scientists.

1022
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,530
So if you just look for them,
you'll,

1023
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,750
you'll decide on their point of view,
you know,

1024
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:18,290
I mean if you just look at any one side 
of any issue you can,

1025
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:20,300
you can get your answers reinforced.

1026
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:23,210
So the problem with that is people are 
just getting their answers reinforced or

1027
00:44:23,211 --> 00:44:26,480
questions rather reinforced there.
They're not necessarily like learning,

1028
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,400
you know,
they're finding other retards,

1029
00:44:28,401 --> 00:44:32,660
your setup websites that confirmed 
they're retarded ideas and all that.

1030
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,200
That's kind of a little bit of a 
problem.

1031
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:37,050
That's one problem with the Internet.
You know,

1032
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,970
the other part of it is just 
magnificent.

1033
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,960
The other part of it is people who are 
open minded who are really using it,

1034
00:44:42,961 --> 00:44:47,130
it's this crazy network of information 
and they're really learning like at this

1035
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,520
incredible exponentially expanding rate.
Like we're learning shit and we're so 

1036
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,300
much more aware of shit than our parents
were.

1037
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,480
Were so much more aware of information.
There's so much more shit going on that 

1038
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:03,681
you have to store in your head.
I mean it's the one I talked to my mom 

1039
00:45:03,681 --> 00:45:05,460
about like the world,
like what's going on in the world.

1040
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,110
It's,
I feel like I'm talking to my daughter.

1041
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:08,850
I mean it's like it's,
you know,

1042
00:45:08,851 --> 00:45:13,851
there's,
there's a level of understanding that 

1043
00:45:13,851 --> 00:45:16,140
our civilization or are.
I'm a generation has reached that really

1044
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:18,600
hasn't been reached before.
Is that just an age thing?

1045
00:45:18,601 --> 00:45:19,170
No,
no.

1046
00:45:19,171 --> 00:45:20,430
It's the,
it's the Internet man.

1047
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:21,450
The Internet.
Yeah.

1048
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,070
I mean it's acceleration.
I mean,

1049
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:28,100
I think our parents were smarter than 
their parents and their parents were 

1050
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,160
smarter than their parents and you know,
it's always been that way that we evolve

1051
00:45:29,161 --> 00:45:30,990
and as we evolve,
we get brighter.

1052
00:45:30,991 --> 00:45:34,000
And you can see that in culture,
you can see that in like the movies that

1053
00:45:34,001 --> 00:45:35,700
use,
they used to watch the 19 forties,

1054
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:37,050
they're fucking horrible.
I mean,

1055
00:45:37,051 --> 00:45:38,270
they're way worse than the right.

1056
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,250
It doesn't even have to be the 1940 the 
other day.

1057
00:45:40,251 --> 00:45:45,251
I watched a reality bites.
I don't know if you remember that movie 

1058
00:45:45,251 --> 00:45:45,251
had a,
uh,

1059
00:45:45,251 --> 00:45:45,251
what's his name?
Ben Stiller.

1060
00:45:45,251 --> 00:45:47,570
Janeane Garofalo had all these famous 
people are awesome.

1061
00:45:47,571 --> 00:45:48,620
Sounds.
What was the other one that you.

1062
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,850
You're telling me that you made your 
girl watch you.

1063
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,120
You thought it was an awesome movie at 
the time,

1064
00:45:53,121 --> 00:45:55,100
but it was fucking terrible and she was 
mad at you.

1065
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:56,450
What was that?
Oh,

1066
00:45:56,451 --> 00:46:01,451
can't buy me love.
But Reality Bites don't you?

1067
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:08,051
The dream big dream is in it.
And he used to mow lawns and he paid the

1068
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,630
money bag.
All those bras delivering pizzas.

1069
00:46:11,631 --> 00:46:16,631
And that's the same one.
No one paid the most popular girl to be 

1070
00:46:16,631 --> 00:46:20,141
his girlfriend for a week.
And then he became too popular and then 

1071
00:46:20,141 --> 00:46:20,970
she's still cranberry juice on a dress 
today.

1072
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:23,090
But I watched that the other day.
It was awful.

1073
00:46:23,091 --> 00:46:24,950
But reality bites,
horrible,

1074
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,970
like really uncomfortable to watch and 
then.

1075
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:30,140
But the worst disturbing thing is I used
to have a crush on Janeane Garofalo back

1076
00:46:30,141 --> 00:46:32,030
in that time period.
I thought she was like,

1077
00:46:32,031 --> 00:46:33,740
oh,
she's a hot comic girl.

1078
00:46:33,741 --> 00:46:35,270
She's so high.
I looked at that movie,

1079
00:46:35,271 --> 00:46:38,720
almost puked because how ugly she was.
Now I want to know what the fuck.

1080
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,940
Don't be rude.
That's rude.

1081
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:48,970
You're being rude in a movie character 
and the character in that movie with 

1082
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:49,880
Abby,
you used to have different tastes.

1083
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:51,410
Now you're into like the porn star.
Look,

1084
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,290
that's all cool.
That's all cool.

1085
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,390
You know?
But back then that's what it is.

1086
00:46:56,391 --> 00:46:57,950
Everybody has a look and he watched the 
movie.

1087
00:46:57,951 --> 00:46:59,360
You could see the line where we're 
making it up.

1088
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,650
That's ridiculous.
Listen,

1089
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:05,651
that's not what's important.
What's important is the evolution of 

1090
00:47:05,651 --> 00:47:05,651
culture.
What's important in this conversation is

1091
00:47:05,651 --> 00:47:06,870
not your fucking weird thing.
Which my.

1092
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:12,490
I'm just saying I evolved.
That movie to me is like I watched 

1093
00:47:12,861 --> 00:47:14,570
altered states.
It was terrible,

1094
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:15,860
right?
Ultra stays totally.

1095
00:47:15,861 --> 00:47:16,380
Just not home.
Hold

1096
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:16,800
up.
I mean,

1097
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:21,801
to me,
that movie changed my life because 

1098
00:47:21,801 --> 00:47:21,801
that's the movie that got me into the 
isolation tanks.

1099
00:47:21,801 --> 00:47:24,120
If it wasn't for altered states,
I probably never would have a tank in my

1100
00:47:24,121 --> 00:47:29,121
basement and when that tank in my 
basement has changed the way I look at 

1101
00:47:29,121 --> 00:47:29,590
the world,
that thing is like my reset button.

1102
00:47:29,591 --> 00:47:32,140
Whenever I got anything that's fucking 
with my hand,

1103
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:35,680
that tank kicks me the real deal.
Every time.

1104
00:47:35,681 --> 00:47:38,740
It's like my guidebook.
It's like literally to me,

1105
00:47:38,741 --> 00:47:43,741
my isolation tank.
He's like my connection to the spirit 

1106
00:47:43,741 --> 00:47:43,741
world.
It's like my spirit guide.

1107
00:47:43,741 --> 00:47:47,200
It sounds completely retarded and gay 
and it sounds new agey,

1108
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,680
but that's what it feels like when I get
in there and I just zone.

1109
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:55,690
I just disappear.
My body disappears when my mind has no 

1110
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:55,690
sensory input.
What?

1111
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:57,700
I'm just floating through space in that 
tank.

1112
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:03,270
I get truth.
I get straight truth about everything 

1113
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:06,280
I've ever done about anything that I've 
ever done where I was the Douche bag.

1114
00:48:06,281 --> 00:48:08,510
Anything that I've ever watched where 
you know,

1115
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:13,580
I,
I can rewatch like things that have 

1116
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:13,660
happened in my life and see where I've 
personally made mistakes,

1117
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,600
things that I've done well,
things that I could have avoided,

1118
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:21,720
reasons why people are upset at me,
like everything you kicks you and then 

1119
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,560
it kicks me everything about what am I 
doing wrong in my personal life?

1120
00:48:23,561 --> 00:48:26,530
What am I doing wrong in my career?
What am I doing wrong in my comedy?

1121
00:48:26,531 --> 00:48:29,590
What am I doing wrong in my writing?
Here's what you could eliminate.

1122
00:48:29,591 --> 00:48:34,591
Here's what you can do better.
Almost never like it's never appraising 

1123
00:48:34,591 --> 00:48:38,670
thing.
It's always like a ruthless 

1124
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:38,740
self-examination experience.
It's never like a experience like,

1125
00:48:38,741 --> 00:48:40,060
yeah,
I'm fucking awesome here.

1126
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,350
I'm in the water.
Never.

1127
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:43,990
It's almost always uncomfortable,
but after you get out of it,

1128
00:48:43,991 --> 00:48:48,991
man,
you have a new found appreciation and 

1129
00:48:48,991 --> 00:48:48,991
respect for life,
you know,

1130
00:48:48,991 --> 00:48:53,821
and that,
that experience would not have happened 

1131
00:48:53,821 --> 00:48:53,821
if I didn't watch that movie.
Altered states and get,

1132
00:48:53,821 --> 00:48:55,000
get confused.
Meanwhile watched it.

1133
00:48:55,001 --> 00:48:57,100
I couldn't even watch the whole movie.
I shut it off.

1134
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,760
It was a piece of shit.
Those old movies just don't hold up like

1135
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:05,830
etc.
I watched that the other day and you 

1136
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:07,641
remember when it was like,
I could believe this is an alien I saw 

1137
00:49:07,641 --> 00:49:07,641
the other day and he's like,
ha,

1138
00:49:07,641 --> 00:49:10,380
I can stop any rocks when he stops on my
rocking.

1139
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:12,610
It's so bad.

1140
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:14,480
It's amazing.
Amazing.

1141
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:19,660
The technology available today,
a random dude with a pc who knows how to

1142
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:24,360
encode three d animation.
he could make something its own computer

1143
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,760
and literally have a texture to it and 
everything.

1144
00:49:26,761 --> 00:49:31,761
It will be way better than 18.
Imagine what you could do that with 

1145
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:31,761
avatar graphics.
Oh my god.

1146
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:31,761
It's going to happen.
Why does that?

1147
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:33,440
Would that be 15 years,
15 years,

1148
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,160
years,
15 years?

1149
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,290
Shit is happening so quickly,
man.

1150
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:38,340
Well,
with the internet,

1151
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:43,850
with the level of complexity that they 
can pull off and animation now is just 

1152
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:43,860
astounding.
I mean,

1153
00:49:43,861 --> 00:49:47,370
avatar still looked a little off,
but the reason why they got away with it

1154
00:49:47,371 --> 00:49:51,060
looking a little off is that they used 
monsters and shit that you don't know in

1155
00:49:51,061 --> 00:49:52,740
real life.
so you know,

1156
00:49:52,741 --> 00:49:54,120
you're looking at it and you go,
oh,

1157
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:55,440
it's fake.
You can't tell it's fake.

1158
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,540
But like you've watched like I am 
legend,

1159
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,340
I am.
Legend is the shit.

1160
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,830
But when they had those lions,
you like,

1161
00:50:01,831 --> 00:50:04,750
get the fuck out of here.
Those lines look so bad here.

1162
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:07,070
They're making a sequel to that have so 
good.

1163
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,220
I love that.
I love that movie.

1164
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,940
That movie was fun.
And uh,

1165
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,510
the um,
in the,

1166
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,920
in the scene where he shoots the lion or
he shoot,

1167
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:16,290
he's going to shoot a deer and align it 
takes out the deer.

1168
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:20,940
It looks so bad.
It looks so corny and fake.

1169
00:50:20,941 --> 00:50:23,400
It's so.
It should be totally unacceptable.

1170
00:50:23,401 --> 00:50:25,560
Like they really should have to film in 
another way,

1171
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:29,930
but you should have to do it in the 
where I can't see it when it happened so

1172
00:50:29,931 --> 00:50:34,931
quickly.
But what you show me is just dog shit 

1173
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:36,470
for a movie that's that powerful.
They can't totally recreate real life.

1174
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:39,350
And because of that,
they can't totally recreate people yet,

1175
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:43,580
but they can really recreate monster 
shit that they make up.

1176
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:46,640
They can make shit that they invent.
Look fucking amazing.

1177
00:50:46,641 --> 00:50:48,500
Like king kong,
king kong.

1178
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:53,530
That was awesome.
I just saw that the other day also and 

1179
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:53,530
that was still looks good,
dude.

1180
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:55,190
I don't even watch that movie.
You know what I do with that movie?

1181
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:58,520
I turned it on to the scene where king 
kong's fucking shit up.

1182
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:01,220
He jack off.
I almost do.

1183
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:02,460
I scratch my chest.

1184
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:07,860
Fucking crazy footage.
If you watching king kong by start 

1185
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:08,120
flooding.

1186
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:13,940
I've always been obsessed with primates.
I have a giant poster.

1187
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:15,430
King kong,
it's like 12 feet tall.

1188
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:20,460
My flasHlights around like fucking apes.
I have just a smidgen more monkey in me 

1189
00:51:21,221 --> 00:51:22,990
than the average person.
I feel.

1190
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:28,230
I feel very connected to the monkeys.
I get angry when I go to the zoo and I 

1191
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:28,540
see the monkeys in the cage.
I always want to let him out.

1192
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:33,100
It's always been like that little kid 
being curious.

1193
00:51:33,101 --> 00:51:34,900
George fan,
sIcilian man.

1194
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:39,930
Those monkeys.
they're way closer to monkeys and 

1195
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:39,930
regular people.
There's.

1196
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,080
There's something about my.
My ancestors,

1197
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:46,320
the way they used to yell at each other.
It's just like going to the fucking 

1198
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,650
chimps.
My grandmother used to fucking scream at

1199
00:51:47,651 --> 00:51:50,140
my grandfather.
She didn't give a fuck that I was there.

1200
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:53,530
She didn't give a fuck that I was three 
or four or whatever the fuck I was.

1201
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:56,080
I'd be standing right next to her.
She and my grandfather.

1202
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:58,600
My grandmother was always late for 
everything.

1203
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:00,520
My grandmother was crazy.
She,

1204
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:02,650
my grandmother did time.
Okay.

1205
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:03,660
So crazy.
My grandma,

1206
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:05,440
my grandmother worked for the mom and 
she didn't come.

1207
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,390
That's crazy.
And my grandmother's bananas,

1208
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,390
but she would fucking screen.

1209
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:16,220
My grandfather's name was joe.
Her name was jo.

1210
00:52:16,221 --> 00:52:18,830
She would fucking scream at him and he 
would have to eat it.

1211
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,820
You're like a monkey.

1212
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:24,630
I wasn't in the family.
My family was in the line

1213
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:27,430
cage at the zoo.
What's up guys?

1214
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,950
Yeah,
you seem like a lion.

1215
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:32,840
I had to

1216
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:33,890
describe you.
You know what?

1217
00:52:33,891 --> 00:52:35,800
What can brian was an animal?
What would it be?

1218
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:38,550
Be?
What are you?

1219
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:39,870
What's your son?
Leah?

1220
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:40,930
Yardley.
That's right.

1221
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:42,680
Don't have a monkey sign.
If they had a monkey sound,

1222
00:52:42,681 --> 00:52:47,681
I'm sure I'd be here a tiger.
Do you get upset when you go to the zoo?

1223
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:52,950
Does that bother you?
It doesn't surprise me fucking crap.

1224
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:54,050
More lIke,
wow,

1225
00:52:54,051 --> 00:52:55,280
tiger.
I don't advise me.

1226
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,180
I'm just not that deep.
I don't care about the dumb animals.

1227
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,950
Like I don't freak out when I see a 
walrus.

1228
00:53:00,951 --> 00:53:02,780
Fuck a wall ball.
We're kIss my ass.

1229
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:05,360
Give a fuck about you.
You're just dumb.

1230
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,890
You know?
What are you doing?

1231
00:53:06,891 --> 00:53:08,690
I don't want to kill you.
I don't want to hurt you.

1232
00:53:08,691 --> 00:53:10,250
I don't want to cause you pain for no 
reason,

1233
00:53:10,251 --> 00:53:12,620
but I don't give a fuck about you.
When's your movies?

1234
00:53:12,621 --> 00:53:13,550
Zookeeper coming out.

1235
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,070
It's not my movie.
Your movie's Kevin James movie,

1236
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,530
bro.
And it comes out in october,

1237
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:20,450
october.
Have you seen a preview?

1238
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:23,450
I've seen little clips where I had to do
a voiceover shit.

1239
00:53:23,451 --> 00:53:24,340
It's going to be fun.
Yeah,

1240
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:25,920
it's a funny movie.
Kevin's hilarious.

1241
00:53:25,921 --> 00:53:27,660
He's a very funny guy.
He's awesome at that.

1242
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:31,230
That whole physical comedy thing and 
doing it with all these animated animals

1243
00:53:31,231 --> 00:53:33,060
and the animated animals.
Pretty fucking dope.

1244
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,110
Yeah.
They just,

1245
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:36,360
they just changed their mouths and make 
their mouths move.

1246
00:53:36,361 --> 00:53:38,580
They're like real animals.
They have to train real animals,

1247
00:53:38,581 --> 00:53:41,550
do certain things,
and then they like add animation to it,

1248
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:46,700
you know,
and then they have like one guy in a 

1249
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:46,700
monkey suit that one guy that's really 
funny,

1250
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:47,400
walked into a car,
accidentally knocked himself out.

1251
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:49,980
It was really fucked up,
you know,

1252
00:53:49,981 --> 00:53:51,510
because he,
he hit the thing hard.

1253
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:55,560
He rented the door,
this car and just fell over our cold.

1254
00:53:55,710 --> 00:54:00,710
Wow.
You didn't see a comment and he walked 

1255
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:00,710
right into a door.
This duck man,

1256
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:00,710
man,
stop man.

1257
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:03,120
A fucking savages.
These guys are nuts,

1258
00:54:03,121 --> 00:54:08,121
man.
The dude that I met on fear factor and 

1259
00:54:08,121 --> 00:54:08,121
the dudes that I've worked with,
especially the guys on this,

1260
00:54:08,121 --> 00:54:08,550
a zookeeper movie,
[inaudible],

1261
00:54:08,551 --> 00:54:10,060
there was a lot of crazy stunts.
I,

1262
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:15,090
I crashed a bike.
I wasn't supposed to be doing my own 

1263
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:17,811
stunts,
but I had this bike scene with me and 

1264
00:54:17,811 --> 00:54:17,811
kevin were.
I'm chAsing them and I'm yelling at him,

1265
00:54:17,811 --> 00:54:21,480
trying to reach them.
I crashed my bike three or four hard 

1266
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:21,480
times.
Hard times.

1267
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:25,800
One way I go over the handlebars.
Are you dating to the concrete dude?

1268
00:54:25,801 --> 00:54:30,801
I went over the bars.
I grabbed the front brake accidentally 

1269
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:31,530
in squeeze it too hard and I just went 
over the top.

1270
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:33,540
That was only one hand in it because I 
was trying to grab him.

1271
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:35,220
JusT improvising a scene.
Dude.

1272
00:54:35,221 --> 00:54:38,670
I launched myself,
but somehow or another I was fine.

1273
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,450
Like somehow or another I this,
the,

1274
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:41,580
the,
the whatever,

1275
00:54:41,581 --> 00:54:43,560
the,
the clear headedness or the,

1276
00:54:43,561 --> 00:54:45,770
you know,
the peace of mind to gather myself.

1277
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:50,780
No,
I knew I was going over this and just 

1278
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:50,780
land correctly enrolled or something,
something.

1279
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:53,070
I got lucky all the time.
The only thing I did,

1280
00:54:53,071 --> 00:54:54,560
I got a scratch on my shin,
but dude,

1281
00:54:54,561 --> 00:54:59,561
that crashed hard like four times.
I did the crash recently that it could 

1282
00:54:59,561 --> 00:55:03,480
have easily broken a wrist or something.
There's was one time when I went down 

1283
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,561
where it was pretty fucking hard.
I went over the handlebars and I got 

1284
00:55:06,561 --> 00:55:07,170
ahold of.
I hit the ground first with my hands and

1285
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:08,790
then my face,
my chin hit the ground,

1286
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:11,190
but I absorbed it and I pulled back 
enough.

1287
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:14,440
It was like just enough level headedness
where I did.

1288
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:17,220
I wound up not because of jujitsu,
I'm always fallen.

1289
00:55:17,221 --> 00:55:19,500
You're always rolling with shit.
You get comfortable with that.

1290
00:55:19,501 --> 00:55:21,180
Like here's the round.
It's like it's normal.

1291
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:22,870
It's a normal feeling,
but dude,

1292
00:55:22,871 --> 00:55:24,530
I kind of got fucked up.
I could have lost some teeth

1293
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:25,010
for sure.
Yeah,

1294
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,670
I,
I just got a bike recently and I did the

1295
00:55:27,671 --> 00:55:32,671
same thing.
I went over my handlebars because I hit 

1296
00:55:32,671 --> 00:55:36,001
a curb.
It was dark out and I hit a curb and it 

1297
00:55:36,001 --> 00:55:38,371
didn't like pop over.
It just went straight down for a second 

1298
00:55:38,371 --> 00:55:39,010
and I flipped over my bike and I felt 
like my teeth.

1299
00:55:39,011 --> 00:55:39,820
I'm like,
oh my god,

1300
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:41,110
that's the first thing I do is grab my 
teeth,

1301
00:55:41,111 --> 00:55:42,520
but I landed okay.
But I was like,

1302
00:55:42,521 --> 00:55:43,570
I could have died right there.

1303
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:44,580
Yeah,
man,

1304
00:55:44,581 --> 00:55:49,581
that's some scary shit.
Bicycles are fucking scary when you're 

1305
00:55:49,581 --> 00:55:49,581
fallen,
man.

1306
00:55:49,581 --> 00:55:53,120
I just read some article about some 
woman who just got paralyzed from a 

1307
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,390
horse racing horse jumping same as 
christopher reeve did,

1308
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:58,170
jumping over hurdles and shit like that.
That's some scary shit,

1309
00:55:58,171 --> 00:55:59,790
dude.
You don't need to be doing that.

1310
00:55:59,791 --> 00:56:00,970
People in,
you know,

1311
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:03,750
taking it from a guy who was involved in
the ufc does jujitsu.

1312
00:56:03,751 --> 00:56:05,590
It sounds ridiculous.
But jujitsu,

1313
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,380
if you,
if you trust your partners,

1314
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:12,620
you pretty safe that.
I mean I'm doing it all the time and 

1315
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,010
I've only been injured a few times and 
one of the injuries was an old injury.

1316
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:19,520
You know,
I had one acl and meniscus tear from my 

1317
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:23,241
old taekwondo days and that one 
re-injured first in jujitsu and then I,

1318
00:56:23,901 --> 00:56:24,290
I

1319
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:26,070
injured the other leg,
but that's over fucking.

1320
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:30,070
I've been doing it now for 14 years.
That's a long ass time.

1321
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:35,280
You not only have a few minor injuries 
and to roll like all the time because 

1322
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:39,481
most of the time you're rolling with 
dudes you can trust and you know you're 

1323
00:56:39,481 --> 00:56:39,520
not going to fucking dump each other on 
each other's heads.

1324
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:44,521
You're not gonna.
You're not going to hurt each other if 

1325
00:56:44,521 --> 00:56:44,521
you don't have to.
Like when you get an armbar stop me back

1326
00:56:44,521 --> 00:56:44,521
off before you know,
you know,

1327
00:56:44,521 --> 00:56:49,470
you know when a dude is got you know,
you don't hurt each other so that you 

1328
00:56:50,171 --> 00:56:50,770
could trust people.

1329
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:52,710
Well,
you can't trust a fucking Horse.

1330
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:55,560
You can't trust a horse.
If the horse is decides,

1331
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,350
fuck this.
It just digs those legs in.

1332
00:56:58,351 --> 00:57:00,900
You're done sign.
You're going to go flying.

1333
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:02,970
You're.
You're on a giant,

1334
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,700
super powerful animal and animal that's 
so strong.

1335
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:09,510
It can run like what?
Fifty miles an hour with a person on its

1336
00:57:09,511 --> 00:57:11,610
back.
Are you fucking kidding me?

1337
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:15,510
You're going to go off like a pillow.
You're just going to go flying off.

1338
00:57:15,511 --> 00:57:17,840
You're not even going to believe how 
light you feel.

1339
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:22,850
That horse just stops and just throws 
his muscular fucking shoulders up into 

1340
00:57:23,071 --> 00:57:28,071
it.
You just launched like you're on a 

1341
00:57:28,071 --> 00:57:28,071
spring head first,
right into the dirt.

1342
00:57:28,071 --> 00:57:30,000
Snap your neck.
How cool would it be?

1343
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,890
none of us had cars because gas went out
and we all had to get horses.

1344
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:36,330
We all had our own horse and then like 
every time we went,

1345
00:57:36,331 --> 00:57:41,331
hung out.
We all had her horses together to be 

1346
00:57:41,331 --> 00:57:41,331
friends with their horse.
Breaks his leg.

1347
00:57:41,331 --> 00:57:42,690
You to shoot him in the head.
I know.

1348
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:43,610
Think that's terrible.
Yeah,

1349
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,650
but then we'll get into horse or two of 
her friends.

1350
00:57:45,651 --> 00:57:50,651
Horses would mate and have a baby horse.
It'd be cool just to have your own 

1351
00:57:50,651 --> 00:57:50,651
horse.
Brian,

1352
00:57:50,651 --> 00:57:53,090
where's into?
She definitely had one extra hit I think

1353
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:58,120
should not have had that third hit.
I think it's cool that I live in an 

1354
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,550
equestrian district where it'd be nice 
if you're with the horse and you treated

1355
00:58:00,551 --> 00:58:05,551
it very well from the time it was young,
so you had an awesome relationship with 

1356
00:58:05,551 --> 00:58:05,551
the horse.
Right.

1357
00:58:05,551 --> 00:58:07,610
But that's not always going to be the 
case and it's going to be like you go to

1358
00:58:07,611 --> 00:58:12,611
a dog park with your dog.
There's always gonna be some douche bag 

1359
00:58:12,611 --> 00:58:12,611
with his fucking dog that wants a bite.
Everybody's dog,

1360
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:18,270
you know.
And that's gonna be what it's going to 

1361
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:18,270
be like with horses.
My other two can't trust people to raise

1362
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:22,661
the horses correctly.
So you're gonna have a bunch of horses 

1363
00:58:22,661 --> 00:58:22,820
out there that are douchebag horses.
They're going to get mad at your horses.

1364
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:25,040
You're gonna have douchebag.
Gang wars.

1365
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:30,390
Awesome.
This is the most ridiculous conversation

1366
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:33,790
to have a horse.
What else,

1367
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:34,620
brian?
Well,

1368
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:39,330
I was shooting for real money.
Wouldn't you get.

1369
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:42,490
I'd get a pony when,
if I can't get a pegasus,

1370
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:46,130
what if we run out of oil or if we run 
out of golf?

1371
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,370
Can we all go back to that?
That'd be crazy.

1372
00:58:48,371 --> 00:58:53,371
If you had to go back to the board.
It's really ridiculous how short a 

1373
00:58:53,371 --> 00:58:53,371
period of time.
I put this on my twitter this week.

1374
00:58:53,371 --> 00:58:56,340
Go just thinking about it.
How nutty it is that 200 years ago,

1375
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,220
the fastest way to get around was on the
back of an animal.

1376
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:00,810
Right?
Two hundred years ago.

1377
00:59:00,811 --> 00:59:03,870
That's so funny to think about it.
And there was no photographs in the best

1378
00:59:03,871 --> 00:59:07,200
way to get an image of someone was to 
draw them 200 years ago.

1379
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:07,200
No,

1380
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,790
that's nothing.
That's um,

1381
00:59:08,791 --> 00:59:12,030
a blink in time.
Jesus christ.

1382
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:15,540
And it's all because of technology and 
an oil.

1383
00:59:15,541 --> 00:59:17,640
Unfortunately.
It's all because of oil.

1384
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,920
All the plastic,
all the shit we use.

1385
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:22,200
I mean,
how is oil

1386
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,560
like embedded in our life?
It's totally,

1387
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,980
it's the main thing for almost all the 
words for religion and oil together.

1388
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:28,610
Yeah.
Well

1389
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:32,430
I believe that religion and oil are 
stuffed in together,

1390
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,480
you know,
on purpose.

1391
00:59:33,481 --> 00:59:35,550
Just to make it easier to control the 
oil,

1392
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:37,500
you know,
whether or not that's true,

1393
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:38,090
you know,
I mean the,

1394
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:43,140
you know,
the idea that the cia is involved and 

1395
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:43,140
all these,
you know,

1396
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:46,520
secret shadow government organizations 
are involved in creating drama and 

1397
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:50,091
turmoil so that we always have an enemy 
over there and that's a very real 

1398
00:59:50,091 --> 00:59:50,091
theory.
And,

1399
00:59:50,091 --> 00:59:50,790
and you know,
if you talk to people who understand,

1400
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:56,070
you know,
how the United States is involved in 

1401
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:58,131
other countries and how we do sell arms 
to people like Iran and Iraq and we do 

1402
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:03,590
provide them with weapons and we played 
both sides of the fence will provide 

1403
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:04,290
their enemy was shit too.
And we create,

1404
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,940
we create drama,
you know,

1405
01:00:05,941 --> 01:00:07,620
this weekend go in there and cleaned it 
up.

1406
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:13,100
We should find a way to make money off 
of religion oil combining the two like 

1407
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:13,350
jesus oil

1408
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:19,220
in the oil business or all the people 
that are supporting the conservative.

1409
01:00:19,221 --> 01:00:20,420
Right?
But at this point,

1410
01:00:20,421 --> 01:00:22,820
I think the concern that I think 
everybody's involved,

1411
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:28,060
you know,
I don't think it's just the 

1412
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:28,060
conservatives.
I don't think it's just the republicans.

1413
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:28,060
The democrats are just as like,
I mean,

1414
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:30,710
I believe obama was in favor of offshore
drilling,

1415
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:35,740
you know,
I think there was so much pressure that 

1416
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:35,740
we need to relieve ourselves of the,
uh,

1417
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:36,530
the need for foreign oil that they,
uh,

1418
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:39,660
that they were in support of it.
I think everybody was of it.

1419
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,000
Look,
it seemed like a great idea.

1420
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:41,880
I was,
I mean,

1421
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:43,460
I thought it was a good idea.
I'm like,

1422
01:00:43,461 --> 01:00:46,100
if they don't spill that shit and it 
doesn't seem like they do very often.

1423
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:46,850
I was like,
well,

1424
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:48,020
hey,
if they know what they're doing,

1425
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,030
that's the problem.
If they know what they're doing.

1426
01:00:50,031 --> 01:00:52,310
So I was in favor of it too until I saw 
this and I was like,

1427
01:00:52,311 --> 01:00:53,600
okay,
this is crazy.

1428
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:54,260
I got it.
No,

1429
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:59,290
that this could happen.
I thought that if something breaks you 

1430
01:00:59,290 --> 01:00:59,290
just shut it off.
You know,

1431
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:00,440
I thought like you have some sort of a 
fail safe.

1432
01:01:00,441 --> 01:01:03,110
Like I can't believe they had no backup 
plan.

1433
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:05,660
Like there's,
they don't know the exact estimate,

1434
01:01:05,661 --> 01:01:09,200
but one of the estimates is 40,000.
You're talking about 40,000

1435
01:01:09,201 --> 01:01:10,310
gallons a day.

1436
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:13,490
That's insane.
Yeah.

1437
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,260
think of how many,
how much oil that is.

1438
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,340
Well,
I think have a big.

1439
01:01:16,341 --> 01:01:18,200
The ocean is,
so I've heard hundreds of thousands.

1440
01:01:18,201 --> 01:01:23,201
I've heard a million gallons a day.
I've heard all these different efforts 

1441
01:01:23,201 --> 01:01:25,750
for hundred thousand,
but even if it's a thousand gallons of 

1442
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:26,690
oil a day even that.
Have you seen the slIck,

1443
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,730
the slickest gigantic,
pretty fun green.

1444
01:01:28,731 --> 01:01:33,731
You can see it with a satellite.
I hate seeing the animals that they're 

1445
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:33,731
like cleaning off their phones is and 
stuff like that.

1446
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:35,040
Well,
the one of the ways that people describe

1447
01:01:35,041 --> 01:01:37,100
me and they're saying that it could be 
apocalyptic,

1448
01:01:37,101 --> 01:01:38,450
like that was the language that they 
use.

1449
01:01:38,451 --> 01:01:42,200
I'll talk elliptic apocalyptic.
It just sells more tee shirts.

1450
01:01:42,201 --> 01:01:43,400
Joe,
is that what it is?

1451
01:01:43,401 --> 01:01:44,690
Yeah.
I don't know dude.

1452
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:45,620
It's,
it seems pretty.

1453
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:46,220
Look at.
Look at,

1454
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:51,260
um,
we're looking at images right now and 

1455
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:52,460
you can't see because you're not here,
but the streak is jai fucking qinetiq.

1456
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,460
Okay.
Forty 2000 gallons of oil per day.

1457
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,620
That's what these people are saying.
I mean,

1458
01:01:57,621 --> 01:02:02,621
who knows if they're right.
nobody's down there with the fucking a 

1459
01:02:02,621 --> 01:02:02,621
measuring spoon.
MeasurIng,

1460
01:02:02,621 --> 01:02:04,290
measuring spoon.
We've been

1461
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:08,590
talking about nobody's down there 
measuring for real,

1462
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:13,740
but it is an insane amount of oil and 
it's leaking out every day and they 

1463
01:02:13,811 --> 01:02:16,810
don't know exactly how they're going to 
stop it and I heard someone last night,

1464
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:22,180
but this is a dude in jujitsu class,
so who knows if he was telling me the 

1465
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:26,061
truth,
it could have been just talking out of 

1466
01:02:26,061 --> 01:02:27,721
his ass,
but he was saying that they could stop 

1467
01:02:27,721 --> 01:02:30,171
the oil,
but the way they would have to stop it 

1468
01:02:30,171 --> 01:02:31,701
is blow up the.
Well they would have to blow it up and 

1469
01:02:31,701 --> 01:02:32,970
if they did that the oil was stopped but
then they'd be fucked because they don't

1470
01:02:32,971 --> 01:02:35,130
want to do that because they have this 
well down there.

1471
01:02:35,131 --> 01:02:40,131
They want to protect and they want to be
able to turn it back on again 

1472
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:40,131
eventually.

1473
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:40,680
If that's true,
that's insane.

1474
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:45,740
If there really is a fix and I have to 
do is blow it up and they're worried 

1475
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:45,990
becAuse this,
this company wants to,

1476
01:02:45,991 --> 01:02:50,991
you know,
continue to pump oil out of there like 

1477
01:02:50,991 --> 01:02:53,300
you.
Number one is you've got to stop what 

1478
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:53,300
you're doing.
You gotta stop oil coming out,

1479
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:54,540
you know,
did you build the build the.

1480
01:02:54,541 --> 01:02:55,500
Well,
you built it right?

1481
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:57,180
You built it.
He going to have to build a new one.

1482
01:02:57,330 --> 01:03:02,330
Okay.
You can't salvage the parts of this 

1483
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:04,200
while it's bleeding oil into the ocean.
I mean that's bananas.

1484
01:03:04,350 --> 01:03:09,350
Like if there really is a fix and the 
fix involves them destroying the whole 

1485
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:09,450
thing,
you got to destroy the whole thing first

1486
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:14,540
and then rebuild it.
I don't care how many years it takes to 

1487
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:14,540
make one of those things.
It doesn't.

1488
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,510
That doesn't mean think how many years 
is going to take to clean up?

1489
01:03:15,511 --> 01:03:16,290
What the fuck he did?

1490
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:19,810
can't you just get a ship of cat litter 
and put it on it?

1491
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:25,230
Isn't that what you do in the garage?
Cat litter,

1492
01:03:25,631 --> 01:03:27,250
just clung to it.
It all.

1493
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:32,260
YOu've used poor bags of it would make 
these big gelatinous cat litter and oil 

1494
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:36,970
glob boulders that'd be sitting on the 
bottom of the ocean floor and they would

1495
01:03:36,971 --> 01:03:38,080
just scoop them up.
I'm up.

1496
01:03:38,350 --> 01:03:43,350
I'm up like one of those cat more sense 
than what they're doinG now.

1497
01:03:44,261 --> 01:03:45,490
Well,
they're not doing anything now.

1498
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:46,120
They,
they've,

1499
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,490
they've trIed to stop it,

1500
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:52,830
they've cut it back a little bit 
apparently supposedly from the most 

1501
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:54,830
recent reports,
but as far as getting it stopped or even

1502
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,600
under control,
if you're not even close,

1503
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,460
they could be a week away from doing 
something,

1504
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:03,790
you know,
they're talking about putting some kind 

1505
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:03,790
of giant dome over it.
I mean,

1506
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:03,790
the whole thing is.

1507
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:03,790
See,
that's ridiculous.

1508
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:05,180
Yeah.
Superman movie.

1509
01:04:05,181 --> 01:04:06,700
If it Works in the garage or [inaudible]
o'shea,

1510
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:09,500
it's fucking bananas.
The whole thing has bananas.

1511
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:12,410
It's literally going to kill everything 
in that area.

1512
01:04:12,650 --> 01:04:17,650
I mean there's the those slick.
I mean I'm looking at the images when 

1513
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:18,800
they show them to you online and it 
doesn't seem real.

1514
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:20,450
That doesn't seem crazy.
Does.

1515
01:04:20,451 --> 01:04:22,360
It literally doesn't seem real.
Look at this.

1516
01:04:22,361 --> 01:04:26,870
There's images.
If you go to earth observatory.nasa.gov,

1517
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:31,940
you know,
you could just throw that picture and 

1518
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:31,940
you ustream producer and show everybody 
right now if I can.

1519
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:31,950
Yeah,
I don't do that.

1520
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:34,260
Save it on your desktop and then just 
throw it in there.

1521
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:35,790
God damn brian,
you're so smart.

1522
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,520
Blank image

1523
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:44,780
slick.
Put that on my desktop

1524
01:04:48,490 --> 01:04:50,910
and now I'm going to ustream producer 
and I just dragged it in.

1525
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:54,460
This is not interesting at all or 
listening online.

1526
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:58,870
How do I do this?
I think you add pictures.

1527
01:04:58,871 --> 01:05:03,240
Here Was this picture,
but they're open image image file.

1528
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:04,270
That's open video file.

1529
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:09,790
I think you clicked on open image file.

1530
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:12,740
Let's go down to your desktop

1531
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:18,670
slick.
So

1532
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:23,330
let's say this works.
What we did is we just start.

1533
01:05:23,331 --> 01:05:24,020
Yeah,
there we go.

1534
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:29,200
We just started using this thing called 
a ustream producer and the reason why.

1535
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:34,520
So now you can see these ustream video 
podcasts on your iphone and your ipad.

1536
01:05:34,850 --> 01:05:38,000
You fucking junkies,
you visual junkies.

1537
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:40,520
but look at that god damn slick.
If you're looking at this on ustream,

1538
01:05:40,521 --> 01:05:43,280
if you're not an you're on itunes,
check this out.

1539
01:05:43,281 --> 01:05:44,390
When you get home,
go,

1540
01:05:44,391 --> 01:05:45,260
uh,
go google it.

1541
01:05:45,261 --> 01:05:50,210
Go to the nasa site and you see the size
of this fucking oil slick on,

1542
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:52,880
on a satellite image.
And it's bananas.

1543
01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:57,910
It's really hard to grasp.
It's so big and it's just nonstop and 

1544
01:05:58,881 --> 01:06:02,330
they don't even have it under control 
and it's just pumping oil.

1545
01:06:02,331 --> 01:06:03,560
And I don't know how the fuck they're 
going to.

1546
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:05,000
I don't know how they're going to fix 
that shit.

1547
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:06,090
Yeah.
I don't know.

1548
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:07,400
I mean,
I don't think they know either,

1549
01:06:07,401 --> 01:06:11,310
man.
Don't think they know my ad.

1550
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,350
Live shot and this action.

1551
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:16,250
See now in the future you can just keep.
That's pretty dope man.

1552
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,440
Powerful producer software.
Powerful.

1553
01:06:18,830 --> 01:06:19,750
Nice.
So,

1554
01:06:19,751 --> 01:06:20,860
uh,
you know,

1555
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:25,950
until we get off fossil fuels,
we're never going to be able to avoid 

1556
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:28,510
catastrophes that happen when,
when oil spills,

1557
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:29,710
there was another one that just happened

1558
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:32,650
and where a m and a

1559
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:38,340
laca straight an oil tanker exploded.
And this was yesterday

1560
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:39,880
in

1561
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:41,890
peck and baroo.

1562
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:43,660
I don't know where that is.

1563
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,440
A crude oil tanker was reported to have 
exploded.

1564
01:06:46,530 --> 01:06:48,450
Like they fucking explode.
That shit's flammable,

1565
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,970
you know?
I mean,

1566
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,870
you can't get away from that.
We have to,

1567
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:53,800
you know,
as a,

1568
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:54,910
as a,
as a species,

1569
01:06:54,911 --> 01:06:59,911
we have to get past that.
They have to figure out these super 

1570
01:06:59,911 --> 01:07:00,190
duper smart dudes have to figure out 
some new way.

1571
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:05,470
no,
but right now it's so hard to do that 

1572
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:06,520
because their system is so oil based.
And it works so well,

1573
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:07,870
you know,
I mean,

1574
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:12,960
think about how much we travel.
Think about everything you do basically 

1575
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:13,510
is involved in going somewhere and 
burning fuel.

1576
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:14,870
You know,
I'm never,

1577
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:15,520
I'm,
I'm,

1578
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:17,550
I'm home for a few days.
You know,

1579
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:18,520
I'm home.
I'm here.

1580
01:07:18,521 --> 01:07:20,170
I mean,
I don't sometimes I never leave my house

1581
01:07:20,171 --> 01:07:22,960
at all for like a few days,
but there's still like,

1582
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:25,120
I'm fucking using electricity.
I mean,

1583
01:07:25,121 --> 01:07:25,570
you know,
you're,

1584
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:25,990
you're,
you're,

1585
01:07:25,991 --> 01:07:28,270
you're constantly using things that are 
made of plastic.

1586
01:07:28,271 --> 01:07:31,310
You constantly consuming,
um,

1587
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:35,200
things that people are produced from oil
and I don't see that changing.

1588
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:37,030
How the fuck is that going to change?
You know,

1589
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:41,180
we would have to come up with a new way 
to reStructure the whole science.

1590
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:43,570
So there would have to be some sort of a
reason to do that,

1591
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:48,930
to get away from the oil.
They would have to be some drastic 

1592
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:48,930
reason.
It would have to be like a cataclysm.

1593
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:53,550
It would literally have to be something 
that resets society and causes us to 

1594
01:07:53,550 --> 01:07:56,500
start from scratch because unless we run
out and we're not going to like,

1595
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:59,230
we're not gonna like pay attention until
we run out.

1596
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:00,520
It's going to be like,
oh shit,

1597
01:08:00,521 --> 01:08:01,480
we're out.
Fuck.

1598
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:02,710
Now we do.
You know,

1599
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:07,711
like literally they're not gonna.
They're not like protecting us and 

1600
01:08:07,711 --> 01:08:09,310
giving us a nice safety net so society 
can progress easily from here.

1601
01:08:09,311 --> 01:08:10,990
Until then.
It's not him.

1602
01:08:11,970 --> 01:08:12,740
Same thing.

1603
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:20,020
Hot man.
Maybe it would.

1604
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:22,040
Maybe it would help,
you know,

1605
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:25,760
but that's not going to fix everything.
It's not going to fix everything.

1606
01:08:25,790 --> 01:08:26,330
It's,
it's,

1607
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:28,520
it's definitely we've got to do 
something.

1608
01:08:28,570 --> 01:08:30,560
This,
this oil thing does not work.

1609
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:35,740
It's,
I mean there's a lot of weird arguments 

1610
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:38,981
about what oil actually is and some 
people believe that oil is some sort of 

1611
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:39,410
a natural substance created by the 
earth.

1612
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:43,760
There's a whole book I got on it called 
black gold stranglehold.

1613
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I haven't bothered to research online to
find out if it's been totally disproven 

1614
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,661
or whether it's bullshit,
but this guy's argument is that the oil 

1615
01:08:52,661 --> 01:08:55,541
isn't fossil fuels.
It's not like really like plankton are 

1616
01:08:55,541 --> 01:08:59,711
dead plants or shit like that,
like when people assume that it is 

1617
01:08:59,711 --> 01:09:02,291
millions of years of that,
but with a finite amount left in the 

1618
01:09:02,291 --> 01:09:02,810
earth,
but actually it's some sort of a natural

1619
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:06,320
fluid that's produced by the earth and 
if that's the truth,

1620
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:08,570
if he's right and he's probably not 
right,

1621
01:09:08,571 --> 01:09:11,840
but if he is right,
that's like the blood of the world.

1622
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:16,190
Like we're like little vampire bugs 
sucking off the blood of the world.

1623
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:18,080
That's too trippy,
man.

1624
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,030
Even if it,
if fossil fuels,

1625
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:23,090
I mean even if it's not that,
you know,

1626
01:09:23,091 --> 01:09:26,330
even if it is the,
the decay of,

1627
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:31,390
you know,
things that have existed on this earth 

1628
01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:32,390
and we're consumed by death and decatur 
and created this,

1629
01:09:32,391 --> 01:09:35,090
this substance that we use now.
Even if that's the case,

1630
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:38,870
then it's like the shit of the earth.
Then it's like we're sucking the shit of

1631
01:09:38,871 --> 01:09:40,460
the earth out.
Well either way,

1632
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:45,610
it's like we're sucking something out 
that's a part of some sort of a natural 

1633
01:09:45,610 --> 01:09:45,610
cycle.
You know?

1634
01:09:45,610 --> 01:09:47,080
It's all supposed to be in there.
It's like,

1635
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:49,670
it's like literally like,
we're like fucking mosquitoes,

1636
01:09:49,671 --> 01:09:54,320
man.
We really are in the earth is us.

1637
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:55,610
Yeah,
the earth is us and we're,

1638
01:09:56,140 --> 01:10:01,140
we're,
we're ticks sucking off the blood and 

1639
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:03,971
the most progress that we've ever had in
the history of our race was when we 

1640
01:10:03,971 --> 01:10:04,400
started sucking off the blood of the 
earth.

1641
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:07,330
When we started cannibalizing mother 
guy,

1642
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:12,400
when we started eating our mother,
that's when everything started going 

1643
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:15,521
awesome.
So they created cars and computers and 

1644
01:10:15,521 --> 01:10:18,860
cell phones and you knoW,
google voice in your pocket.

1645
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:24,010
All that shit is all because that we 
have this oil because we have figured 

1646
01:10:24,010 --> 01:10:25,870
out a way to to make sure that the oil 
and that we can transport shit with oil.

1647
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:28,760
You could get planes to fly using oil 
and we can.

1648
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:32,600
I mean it's fucking bananas.
It's what a crazy society.

1649
01:10:32,601 --> 01:10:37,601
One thing comes along,
combustion engines figuring out how to 

1650
01:10:37,601 --> 01:10:38,840
use oil for plastic,
for fuel,

1651
01:10:38,841 --> 01:10:42,800
for all these different things and 
everythIng just goes buck nana's.

1652
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,340
And then the question is,
what's next?

1653
01:10:46,341 --> 01:10:47,810
Have you heard about the smart dust 
shit?

1654
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:49,400
Yeah,
dude,

1655
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:52,120
let me gliffy be our friend cliff.
He be over at epic games,

1656
01:10:52,121 --> 01:10:53,650
sent me this.
You're gonna,

1657
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:54,590
you're gonna.
Have to google this.

1658
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:59,940
You got to google up smart dust.
This is the most bizarre thing that I 

1659
01:11:00,201 --> 01:11:02,720
think I have ever heard in my fucking 
life.

1660
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:05,180
These are,
listen to this,

1661
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:10,260
these.
These are wireless devices that are the 

1662
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:12,830
size of grains of sand inside these 
wireless devices.

1663
01:11:12,831 --> 01:11:17,831
The of grains of sand,
they have the ability to transmit 

1664
01:11:17,831 --> 01:11:18,870
wirelessly.
They have a power source.

1665
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:22,440
They have the ability to receive and 
send data.

1666
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:27,860
They have the ability to take images.
It's the size of a fucking green sand.

1667
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:29,820
What websites?
Cnn.

1668
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:33,850
This is on cnn,
how it is fucking bananas and they're.

1669
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:38,870
They're literally talking about this 
being this smart dust being a real world

1670
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:42,660
web and the idea is that wireless 
sensors,

1671
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:47,750
they,
that you can use these wireless sensors 

1672
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:48,360
to monitor everything all over the world
all the time.

1673
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:50,730
Like literally there will be no privacy.

1674
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:54,280
So don't you think the smart desk 
probably would already have existed?

1675
01:11:54,430 --> 01:11:54,940
you know,
if,

1676
01:11:54,941 --> 01:11:59,941
if this was true stuff,
it's probably already probably in our 

1677
01:11:59,941 --> 01:11:59,941
room right now.
I mean,

1678
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:01,780
do you think they're already been used?
Maybe it was telling us about it because

1679
01:12:01,781 --> 01:12:03,430
what did they do?
Use it first and then

1680
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:09,570
is pretty easy to track.
I think it's pretty easy to track up to 

1681
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:10,370
a certain point like what people are 
capable of.

1682
01:12:10,610 --> 01:12:12,620
But this.
I mean I don't,

1683
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:17,710
I don't know if the guys who make the 
most money of the top scientists who 

1684
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:21,371
they are incorporated by.
I'm not familiar with the scientific 

1685
01:12:21,371 --> 01:12:21,371
world,
so I don't know if they.

1686
01:12:21,371 --> 01:12:22,610
They get record recruited by big 
corporations or if they get recruited by

1687
01:12:22,611 --> 01:12:24,850
the government and who gets all the best
scientists.

1688
01:12:24,851 --> 01:12:27,290
You know,
who gets all the crazy genius do money,

1689
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:30,500
money does right oil and.
well this thing is,

1690
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:33,350
this is a really bananas fucking 
project.

1691
01:12:33,351 --> 01:12:36,020
It's really hard to explain how crazy 
this is.

1692
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,750
There's a company called street line 
that's installed 12,000

1693
01:12:38,751 --> 01:12:43,250
sensors on parking spots and highways in
san francisco and the sensors,

1694
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:48,400
what they know is whether or not there's
a car in that spot and what they're 

1695
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:48,650
going to do is they're going to figure 
out a way to give you data.

1696
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:50,380
So say if you're going,
you know,

1697
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:52,490
16th street and fair banks,
you know,

1698
01:12:52,491 --> 01:12:54,050
I need a parking spot.
Is there any available?

1699
01:12:54,051 --> 01:12:55,090
Yes,
there's one right here.

1700
01:12:55,110 --> 01:13:00,110
Go get it.
And they will tell you whether or not 

1701
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:00,110
there's traffic headed to that parking 
spot.

1702
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:00,950
Traffic's clear.
No cars nearby.

1703
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:04,400
Like you can fucking go.
They'll tell you where the traffic is,

1704
01:13:04,401 --> 01:13:08,630
like the sensors on the street will be 
able to pick up traffic and they'll know

1705
01:13:08,631 --> 01:13:10,320
what speed it's moving at.
There's,

1706
01:13:10,321 --> 01:13:13,850
there's gonna be no more speeding son.
They're going to be able to know who you

1707
01:13:13,851 --> 01:13:16,340
are and how fast you're going all the 
time.

1708
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:18,920
Like that's real.
That's going to suck.

1709
01:13:19,450 --> 01:13:19,840
That's okay.

1710
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:23,130
So there's not going to be any sports 
cars and sports cars.

1711
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:25,830
You have to have to turn in your shit 
and get some slow ass.

1712
01:13:26,350 --> 01:13:30,070
Only have horses,
you and the horses because horses,

1713
01:13:30,071 --> 01:13:31,310
you can't.
It's not ethical.

1714
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:32,940
Yeah,
you can't.

1715
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:34,680
Who cares about speeding on horses?
Well,

1716
01:13:34,681 --> 01:13:35,820
the sensor is going to be in the 
streets,

1717
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:38,380
so they'll be able to tell you that your
horse is going to factor.

1718
01:13:38,381 --> 01:13:40,050
It wasn't a speed limits when people had
horses,

1719
01:13:40,051 --> 01:13:41,040
right?
I don't think so.

1720
01:13:41,041 --> 01:13:43,170
It was actually better to go as fast as 
you could.

1721
01:13:43,171 --> 01:13:45,000
You had the best.
You probably have the best world.

1722
01:13:45,001 --> 01:13:47,460
So we're going to go back.
If you fell as fast you could,

1723
01:13:47,461 --> 01:13:52,461
you know,
maybe we should take it easy and just 

1724
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:52,461
play it safe.
That's why you have leather shit on.

1725
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:52,461
Let's just not gonna help you in your 
land,

1726
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:54,840
in your fucking hand on a cobblestone 
street because the horse,

1727
01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:57,900
he saw a rat sensors to protect as a 
horse freaks out sandman

1728
01:13:57,950 --> 01:13:59,210
man.
He's a fucking rat kuvan.

1729
01:13:59,211 --> 01:14:01,940
And you go flying and smash your head on
the curb.

1730
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:03,860
That's it.
Horses,

1731
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,000
horses.
Fuck oil.

1732
01:14:05,090 --> 01:14:06,010
Well,
this,

1733
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:11,040
this real world web that they are trying
to create is one of the strangest 

1734
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:13,840
inventions that I think I've ever heard 
about.

1735
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:14,820
Um,
I,

1736
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:18,160
I did not know that they were this far 
along.

1737
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:23,550
I mean,
these smart dust sensors can be 

1738
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:23,550
relatively small and portable,
portable.

1739
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:25,540
What they're talking about with this is 
that they're gonna.

1740
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:28,960
They're gonna have trillions of these 
things all over the world.

1741
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:30,880
I mean,
this is the idea behind it.

1742
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,960
Is this even possible though,
or is this just theories?

1743
01:14:34,990 --> 01:14:37,030
Hewlett packard's involved and they're 
calling it.

1744
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:42,090
They're calling it the central nervous 
system for the earth and the coming 

1745
01:14:42,090 --> 01:14:45,151
years.
The company plans to deploy a trillion 

1746
01:14:45,151 --> 01:14:46,150
sensors all over the planet.
What?

1747
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:50,110
How bananas is first of all,
how bananas is it that someone's letting

1748
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:51,520
them do that?
If you're going to do what

1749
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:56,630
I can't,
we vote on this before you put jesus 

1750
01:14:56,821 --> 01:14:59,790
christ.
You know there will be no privacy.

1751
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:01,830
There will be no privacy.
It will be impossible.

1752
01:15:02,010 --> 01:15:07,010
Someone will be able to detect this.
Can't happen because then if it's like 

1753
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:10,401
this,
then we can put sensors in the white 

1754
01:15:10,401 --> 01:15:10,401
house.

1755
01:15:10,401 --> 01:15:10,401
yes it can.
Yes,

1756
01:15:10,401 --> 01:15:10,401
it can.
Dude,

1757
01:15:10,401 --> 01:15:15,121
I've been saying for a long time that I 
believe that the next stage of human 

1758
01:15:15,121 --> 01:15:17,320
beings is going to be the no secret 
stage that's going to.

1759
01:15:17,321 --> 01:15:19,090
There's going to be some.
I mean,

1760
01:15:19,091 --> 01:15:24,091
it's going to be eventually it's gonna 
get to the point where we can see each 

1761
01:15:24,091 --> 01:15:26,611
other's thoughts and we can communicate 
with each other and read each other's 

1762
01:15:26,611 --> 01:15:29,341
minds and memories and ideas and we get 
each other's ideas directly from each 

1763
01:15:29,341 --> 01:15:29,341
other.
That's the next stage,

1764
01:15:29,341 --> 01:15:30,760
but it's not going to go directly to 
that.

1765
01:15:30,910 --> 01:15:33,310
It's gonna.
Take a little pit stop along the way and

1766
01:15:33,311 --> 01:15:36,100
the pitstop it's going to take along the
way is no more privacy.

1767
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:38,920
that's step number one.
Before the interface,

1768
01:15:38,921 --> 01:15:41,200
before human beings are allowed to 
interface with each other,

1769
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:44,410
where before we were allowed to become 
one gigantic,

1770
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:47,740
gigantic wireless mind and that's 
possible

1771
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,720
and park probably.

1772
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:54,840
I think that's the future.
I think there's gonna be some sort of a 

1773
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:54,840
neural connection that allows everybody 
to connect with everybody,

1774
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:59,540
but before that happens,
they're going to have to come up with 

1775
01:15:59,540 --> 01:15:59,540
something like this.
Before that happens.

1776
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:03,561
There's going to be an intermediate step
and then the intermediate step will be 

1777
01:16:03,561 --> 01:16:03,561
no more privacy.
You're gonna be able to watch people.

1778
01:16:03,561 --> 01:16:04,650
Fuck.
you're going to be able to do

1779
01:16:04,910 --> 01:16:07,730
everything all the time.
Maybe we're looking at the negative part

1780
01:16:07,731 --> 01:16:08,430
of this.
I don't think.

1781
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:09,790
Now we can see.
Yeah,

1782
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:10,940
that was going to say,
now we can see people.

1783
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:13,120
Fuck,
I could fucking watch you watch you.

1784
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:18,820
Not with my marrow blocker.
I'm going to make when I make my neuro 

1785
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:18,820
block or I got to leave latest

1786
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:19,110
shit.
Yo.

1787
01:16:19,770 --> 01:16:21,720
That's what the problem.
Everybody's going to have a leadership.

1788
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:27,460
It's going to be like computer viruses.
You're going to have to always be one 

1789
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:29,961
step up.
do you know there's something like 

1790
01:16:29,961 --> 01:16:29,961
fucking 4,000
new kubota was at 4:40.

1791
01:16:29,961 --> 01:16:31,620
how many computer viruses are created a 
day,

1792
01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:35,310
but at some been fucking crazy number.
Almost said bananas again,

1793
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:40,490
which would have been annoying.
Caught myself to think about how crazy 

1794
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:42,870
that is.
They're going to get to a point where,

1795
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:44,550
I mean,
how many is that?

1796
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:48,150
40 two.
How many are out there?

1797
01:16:49,710 --> 01:16:51,490
Who gives a fuck?
Our.

1798
01:16:51,870 --> 01:16:56,870
Our point is ladies and gentlemen that 
are privacy is slowly going away and I 

1799
01:16:56,870 --> 01:17:01,050
think that that is a part of the natural
evolution of the human race.

1800
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:06,350
I think that the human race iS evolving 
to something that is no longer to deal 

1801
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:07,180
with embarrassment,
no way.

1802
01:17:07,230 --> 01:17:10,280
We're going to have a different set 
needs because

1803
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:15,280
our environment has changed so radically
from what our physical biology is coded 

1804
01:17:15,411 --> 01:17:20,411
for that.
It's forcing this sort of an evolution 

1805
01:17:20,411 --> 01:17:23,060
of technology is forcing us to evolve as
socially as well as it is evolving like 

1806
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:29,980
technologically.
Like as they come up with crazy and 

1807
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:29,980
crazier shit that dissolves boundaries 
more and more,

1808
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:32,390
we're forced to play catch up and that's
what's gonna happen.

1809
01:17:32,391 --> 01:17:35,630
If we get to a point where there's no 
more privacy,

1810
01:17:35,631 --> 01:17:40,631
then we're going to realize how 
ridiculous privacy isn't the first 

1811
01:17:40,631 --> 01:17:40,631
place.
You know,

1812
01:17:40,631 --> 01:17:40,910
we're going to realize how ridiculous 
embarrassment is.

1813
01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:46,010
Shame and all the stupid shit.
Like my daughter never wants to admit 

1814
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:47,450
when she shouldn't.
She's fucking too.

1815
01:17:47,451 --> 01:17:48,950
She never wants a minute.
You know,

1816
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:52,880
she'll shake your head,
no machine making shit faces,

1817
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:54,440
you know,
she doesn't want you to touch her.

1818
01:17:54,441 --> 01:17:55,810
Like they get embarrassed.
It's like it's,

1819
01:17:56,050 --> 01:18:01,050
it's almost a natural coding in our 
system and I think eventually all that 

1820
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:01,490
stuff is going to deteriorate.

1821
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:04,970
I think it's going to dissolve,
it's going to be crushed by innovation.

1822
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:08,930
I think that's what's going to force us 
to catch up because it's like the things

1823
01:18:08,931 --> 01:18:12,200
that we accept as part of like our 
normal culture and the way behave.

1824
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:15,290
A lot of it is just just what we get 
used to.

1825
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:20,590
I mean,
think about the shit that people get 

1826
01:18:20,590 --> 01:18:20,590
used to another country.
It's thinking about the cultures and the

1827
01:18:20,590 --> 01:18:22,850
weird traditions that people have been a
part of like throughout history,

1828
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:26,720
amish people and you know,
people who have plates in their lips and

1829
01:18:26,721 --> 01:18:27,530
you know,
and,

1830
01:18:27,550 --> 01:18:31,130
and nutty motherfuckers who do all kinds
of different rituals all over the world.

1831
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:32,870
You know,
it's all what you get used to it.

1832
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:35,150
You know,
we're just used to privacy.

1833
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:36,410
Yeah,
we're used to it,

1834
01:18:36,570 --> 01:18:41,570
but it's not necessary.
This is going to be more important for 

1835
01:18:41,570 --> 01:18:41,580
us to get rid of douche bags.

1836
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:46,700
It's gonna be more important for us to 
realize the importance of educating 

1837
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:50,081
human beings and raising human beings 
that think correctly and to be 

1838
01:18:50,081 --> 01:18:53,150
responsible for the human beings you 
create and raise like you're responsible

1839
01:18:53,151 --> 01:18:57,830
for your fucking dog biting something,
but you're not responsible for your son,

1840
01:18:58,010 --> 01:18:58,560
you know,
like,

1841
01:18:58,600 --> 01:18:59,990
uh,
becoming a mass murderer,

1842
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:00,770
you know?
Then it's just,

1843
01:19:00,771 --> 01:19:01,610
oh,
he got crazy.

1844
01:19:01,611 --> 01:19:03,200
I don't know what happened.
You know,

1845
01:19:03,290 --> 01:19:08,290
if your son kick someone's ass and does 
a Bad thing to someone and breaks their 

1846
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:10,640
property,
you can get sued or you will have to pay

1847
01:19:10,641 --> 01:19:12,890
for that kid's medical expenses and you 
have to.

1848
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:15,260
But if your son is some fucking mass 
murderer,

1849
01:19:15,290 --> 01:19:16,040
I mean,
what are they going to do?

1850
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:21,410
Are they going to do?
Maybe you should go to fucking jail.

1851
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:26,500
You made a monster.
You made someone that likes to kill 

1852
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:26,500
hookers.
How'd that happen?

1853
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:27,470
Oh,
it just happened.

1854
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:29,600
We don't even know the fuck.
You don't know.

1855
01:19:29,601 --> 01:19:32,540
You did something terrible.
You are so shitty.

1856
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:37,660
And raising a human being that you raise
the human being that likes to kill and 

1857
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:37,910
eat other human beings.

1858
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:41,190
Because sometimes that's totally just 
nothing to do with parents.

1859
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,770
I don't believe that.
You don't know.

1860
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:43,740
No.
You think?

1861
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:47,250
I think there are some thIngs that 
happened to people genetically.

1862
01:19:47,251 --> 01:19:48,540
I certainly think so.
What do you.

1863
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:50,910
They recognize that.
Yeah,

1864
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:52,770
but that's not how you connecting gay 
people.

1865
01:19:52,771 --> 01:19:57,771
Serial killers.
Because that's something that they're 

1866
01:19:57,771 --> 01:19:59,601
not trained to do.
You mean that you mean they weren't 

1867
01:19:59,601 --> 01:20:01,050
raised in in sexual desires?
This,

1868
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:06,080
that's just just.
That's how you get people's eyes are 

1869
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,811
blue.
Some people's eyes are brown skinned 

1870
01:20:08,811 --> 01:20:08,811
people like you know,
that's just It.

1871
01:20:08,811 --> 01:20:09,380
Wires get crossed,
likes to get sucked.

1872
01:20:09,381 --> 01:20:10,920
Dicks.
This person likes to stab somebody.

1873
01:20:10,921 --> 01:20:12,160
It's how your brain.
No,

1874
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:17,460
that man sociopath's,
they're not exactLy sure where that 

1875
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:20,940
comes from and it's not necessarily that
every serial killers or sociopath.

1876
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:25,941
Some people are just obsessed and insane
and broken and they have a lot of other 

1877
01:20:25,941 --> 01:20:25,941
issues,
but they.

1878
01:20:25,941 --> 01:20:28,890
They think that there's a lot more 
sociopaths.

1879
01:20:28,891 --> 01:20:31,230
People that don't care about other 
people's feelings

1880
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:36,280
a lot more than you think.
And they're not know though whether it 

1881
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:39,221
comes from nature or nurture.
I didn't really know a lot of 

1882
01:20:39,221 --> 01:20:41,921
speculation like your dad molested you 
stab somebody or your dad let you watch 

1883
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:48,060
when you're watching hormones.
Doesn't know if anything that's been 

1884
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:48,060
proven that watching horror movies,

1885
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:52,680
playing video games is a release.
According to todd hollingshead from id 

1886
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:56,740
software.
He and I were having a conversation 

1887
01:20:56,740 --> 01:20:57,160
aBout this the other night when he was 
saying that that violence among kids has

1888
01:20:57,161 --> 01:21:02,161
gone down since popularity and video 
games and violent video games has gone 

1889
01:21:02,161 --> 01:21:05,940
up.
That it has sort of a cathartic release 

1890
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:05,940
sort of thing.

1891
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:08,960
That's what they believe in Japan to do.
I think it's turning us into super 

1892
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:12,331
humans with dre.
I think there's better driving from 

1893
01:21:12,331 --> 01:21:14,721
video games the other day.
Somebody just the world record for 

1894
01:21:14,721 --> 01:21:17,691
sniper shooting.
A guy shot somebody a mile and a half 

1895
01:21:17,691 --> 01:21:17,691
away.
You know,

1896
01:21:17,691 --> 01:21:20,130
I think the video thing is video.
I think video games,

1897
01:21:20,131 --> 01:21:22,890
hand to eye coordination is off the 
fucking hook.

1898
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:23,740
I mean,
when,

1899
01:21:23,810 --> 01:21:27,330
if you think about it,
like how much it is,

1900
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,040
like for people that play video games 
all day,

1901
01:21:29,041 --> 01:21:33,120
it's all about hand to eye coordination.
It's about shit like that.

1902
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:38,121
And that's amazing.
Is that the use the same controller for 

1903
01:21:38,121 --> 01:21:38,121
the xbox?
For those drones?

1904
01:21:38,121 --> 01:21:42,410
Yeah.
They use the xbox controls and 

1905
01:21:42,410 --> 01:21:42,410
playstation controllers.
There you go.

1906
01:21:42,410 --> 01:21:42,410
See?
He used to doing that,

1907
01:21:42,410 --> 01:21:43,200
right?
I mean they,

1908
01:21:43,210 --> 01:21:46,230
they allow them to choose.
If you get to the army guys like can you

1909
01:21:46,231 --> 01:21:47,730
do playstation or more of an xbox?

1910
01:21:47,730 --> 01:21:52,650
Whatever guy do that are different.
WhaT we want to be remote boxes to me is

1911
01:21:52,651 --> 01:21:53,180
like,
you know,

1912
01:21:53,190 --> 01:21:58,190
it's like marvel versus dc.
There was never a dc kind of a guy like 

1913
01:21:58,190 --> 01:21:58,190
marble,
right?

1914
01:21:58,190 --> 01:21:59,190
Know,
we'll fucking ps three.

1915
01:21:59,191 --> 01:22:01,680
I fuck a playstation.
Those are faggy sure.

1916
01:22:01,681 --> 01:22:03,510
There must be dudes like that out there.
Totally.

1917
01:22:03,570 --> 01:22:04,680
They go into the army,
but say,

1918
01:22:04,681 --> 01:22:05,580
man,
I was pissed off.

1919
01:22:05,581 --> 01:22:10,581
I had to play with a playstation.
I kill people with a playstation remote 

1920
01:22:10,581 --> 01:22:14,700
mad.
I wanted to represent x blocks in my 

1921
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:16,100
country.
The navy is always nintendo.

1922
01:22:16,110 --> 01:22:19,230
We were all just kidding.
Just kidding,

1923
01:22:19,550 --> 01:22:20,310
you know,
but

1924
01:22:20,370 --> 01:22:20,940
they,
uh,

1925
01:22:20,941 --> 01:22:23,520
they do pilot those drones with,
uh,

1926
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:25,710
with the same controllers,
which is really crazy.

1927
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:27,350
When I,
when I firsT heard that,

1928
01:22:27,351 --> 01:22:28,380
that they do that,
I was like,

1929
01:22:28,381 --> 01:22:30,360
that is genius.
Makes sense.

1930
01:22:30,361 --> 01:22:30,990
I mean,
why not?

1931
01:22:30,991 --> 01:22:35,991
These kids,
they grow up and they're so goddamn 

1932
01:22:35,991 --> 01:22:35,991
coordinated,
but that shit,

1933
01:22:35,991 --> 01:22:38,880
if you want someone to be awesome at 
killing people with remote control 

1934
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,241
devices,
who the fuck would you get besides of 

1935
01:22:41,241 --> 01:22:41,241
that?

1936
01:22:41,241 --> 01:22:41,241
Yeah,
they're,

1937
01:22:41,241 --> 01:22:41,241
they,
they're the masters.

1938
01:22:41,241 --> 01:22:44,750
Would they use it now in the army?
They use video games for going into 

1939
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:45,150
cities and stuff.
They have like,

1940
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:46,830
you know,
call of duty's shit,

1941
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:47,970
dude.
It's crazy

1942
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:48,700
if you,
if you,

1943
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:52,690
if you really watch like some young kids
that are bad ass video game players,

1944
01:22:52,810 --> 01:22:56,800
like I got a chance to watch this dude 
named fatalities at the.

1945
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:59,290
Jonathan wendell I think is his name.
I met him in vegas too.

1946
01:22:59,291 --> 01:23:01,600
It's a really cool guy.
He's a ufc fan.

1947
01:23:01,601 --> 01:23:05,170
I met him at one of the ufc and um,
he lives in vegas.

1948
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:08,230
This dude is the number one.
He was at least at one point in time the

1949
01:23:08,231 --> 01:23:12,660
number one quake player in the world and
I got to see him play live one,

1950
01:23:12,661 --> 01:23:17,661
so it was at e three,
the big electronics a thing in the 

1951
01:23:17,661 --> 01:23:20,671
conference or whatever the fuck it is 
convention in los angeles and I got to 

1952
01:23:20,671 --> 01:23:21,670
see him play quake live.
It was ridiculous.

1953
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:27,210
Quake Is like fast twitch muscle fibers.
It's all like with quake is if you've 

1954
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:31,791
never played quake before and good for 
you because that shit will addict the 

1955
01:23:31,791 --> 01:23:31,791
fuck out of you that that shit.

1956
01:23:31,791 --> 01:23:36,750
EIght years of my life,
it's an awesome game and you're in this 

1957
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:37,750
three dimensional world.
It's a first person shooter,

1958
01:23:37,751 --> 01:23:42,751
so you're holding a rifle or a rocket 
launch or something and you're running 

1959
01:23:42,751 --> 01:23:45,871
through these really complicated three 
dimensional mazes and you're fighting 

1960
01:23:45,871 --> 01:23:47,320
other people in near real time and it is
real time.

1961
01:23:47,321 --> 01:23:49,450
If you hooked up to computers out and 
you play against each other,

1962
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:53,260
it's so fucking fun.
It's so fun.

1963
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:56,230
It's so crazy.
It's fucking bananas.

1964
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:57,600
Bananas again.
God,

1965
01:23:57,730 --> 01:24:02,730
it rockets are flying and rail guns and 
you're electrocuting dudes with a light 

1966
01:24:02,730 --> 01:24:02,950
gun.
Lightning gun,

1967
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:07,980
lightening bolt gun so much goddamn fun.
I watched this dude play this guy alive 

1968
01:24:07,980 --> 01:24:09,940
like he played like challengers,
like people will step up and play them.

1969
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:15,300
It was the most,
the most ridiculous rape you've ever 

1970
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:15,910
seen in your life.
IT will be like brock lesnar fighting my

1971
01:24:15,911 --> 01:24:17,290
cat.
That's what it was like.

1972
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:22,350
I mean these guys would just get 
destroyed and you watch this guys like 

1973
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:22,350
hand eye coordination.
You're like,

1974
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:24,340
man,
that's incredible.

1975
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:27,390
To get that good at one specific type of
games,

1976
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:28,650
get locked in,
you know?

1977
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:31,510
That's totally applicable for like 
warfare,

1978
01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:34,600
right?
Fuck.

1979
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:37,390
We're learning how to kill people with 
video games.

1980
01:24:37,391 --> 01:24:42,110
It's like that starfighter movie where 
they went and they put a game out.

1981
01:24:42,130 --> 01:24:43,020
The scene would be awesome

1982
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:48,660
games.
It's like all based off like a video 

1983
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:48,660
game or something like that was going to
get into the world.

1984
01:24:48,930 --> 01:24:50,470
Yeah.
Matthew broderick was.

1985
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:51,250
See,
that's.

1986
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:54,010
See that's a movie you can't watch 
nowadays because that's gay.

1987
01:24:54,011 --> 01:24:54,940
If you wAtch that,
you were like,

1988
01:24:54,941 --> 01:24:57,070
this is the most unbelievable bullshit 
ever.

1989
01:24:57,210 --> 01:24:59,800
I watched aliens the other day when I 
was watching aliens.

1990
01:24:59,801 --> 01:25:04,801
They had the scene where he was talking 
to the computer and the computer's like 

1991
01:25:04,801 --> 01:25:08,281
old old ass text.
They haven't even figured out a graphic 

1992
01:25:08,281 --> 01:25:11,461
user interface.
There was no idea that that would ever 

1993
01:25:11,461 --> 01:25:14,880
take place.
So it was computers were all lights all 

1994
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,370
around you for no reason,
but was all lit up and big and stupid.

1995
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:16,150
It's like,
oh,

1996
01:25:16,151 --> 01:25:17,350
that's your computer,
you know?

1997
01:25:17,351 --> 01:25:20,020
That's how ridiculous is that.
It's like star trek.

1998
01:25:20,290 --> 01:25:21,430
It's just.
Yeah.

1999
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:24,610
So who knows what the fuck is ever going
to happen with the smart dust shit.

2000
01:25:24,611 --> 01:25:28,570
But you know,
I find it amazing that this is something

2001
01:25:28,571 --> 01:25:29,710
that's on,
you know,

2002
01:25:30,170 --> 01:25:33,470
cnn labs on,
you know,

2003
01:25:33,471 --> 01:25:36,830
on the internet.
But I'm not hearing about this anywhere.

2004
01:25:36,950 --> 01:25:38,210
Is anybody hearing about this?

2005
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:40,280
Sure.
That was published April 1st.

2006
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:42,550
By the way,
was it?

2007
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:44,650
No mayfair,
you know,

2008
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:46,700
just double checking out there.
It seems ridiculous.

2009
01:25:46,701 --> 01:25:48,520
That was yesterday.
It does seem ridiculous or something.

2010
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:49,520
But it was yesterday.

2011
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:52,460
So this is a real project,
a real thing.

2012
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:55,140
If that's really happening right now.
I mean,

2013
01:25:55,190 --> 01:25:58,220
are they gonna?
Let us know when it goes live.

2014
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:02,830
Don't see how like the government's 
allowing that to.

2015
01:26:02,831 --> 01:26:04,160
They're just doing it.
There's

2016
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,360
no,
there's no precedent.

2017
01:26:05,361 --> 01:26:06,920
Yeah,
but it's like google maps,

2018
01:26:06,921 --> 01:26:07,300
they're,
I mean,

2019
01:26:07,310 --> 01:26:09,470
they're there,
they're doing some nutty shit man.

2020
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:10,610
They're just just.
I mean,

2021
01:26:10,611 --> 01:26:12,920
google maps actually has gotten in 
trouble for a few things.

2022
01:26:12,921 --> 01:26:17,921
There has been some,
some disputes about what they are in 

2023
01:26:17,921 --> 01:26:19,880
cities,
but what these guys are doing is,

2024
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:25,000
you know,
I think they probably feel like they're 

2025
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:25,000
just creating a network,
you know?

2026
01:26:25,290 --> 01:26:26,510
I don't know.
I don't.

2027
01:26:26,511 --> 01:26:28,850
I mean maybe they're exaggerating the 
capabilities.

2028
01:26:29,030 --> 01:26:34,030
Maybe there's some dispute about what's 
going to be possible and what's not 

2029
01:26:34,030 --> 01:26:34,030
going to be.
But the bottom line is they're not going

2030
01:26:34,030 --> 01:26:35,690
to stop here.
They're not going to stop with this.

2031
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:40,960
You know,
if this is something that creating in 

2032
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,551
2010,
what the fuck are they going to have in 

2033
01:26:42,551 --> 01:26:42,551
2020?
You know,

2034
01:26:42,551 --> 01:26:42,620
what,
what are they going to have in 2030?

2035
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:47,660
There's gonna be some nutty shits on.
It's getting fucking crazy

2036
01:26:48,710 --> 01:26:51,440
or it's like us talking about 10 years 
ago and nothing really like,

2037
01:26:51,441 --> 01:26:52,670
oh,
we don't have vcrs anymore.

2038
01:26:52,671 --> 01:26:57,671
We have blue ray,
you don't spend a lot of things have 

2039
01:26:57,671 --> 01:26:57,671
changed in 10 years.
Yeah,

2040
01:26:57,671 --> 01:26:58,930
to a point,
but then you're also thinking like

2041
01:26:59,030 --> 01:27:04,030
on the high end level will the high end,
but the higher end of technology things 

2042
01:27:04,030 --> 01:27:08,741
have changed drastically.
Like with the large hadron collider and 

2043
01:27:08,741 --> 01:27:11,500
those guys in.
Whereas I think it's a Massachusetts 

2044
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,690
that are trying to recreate a son or 
trying to figure out how to make a 

2045
01:27:13,690 --> 01:27:13,690
fucking son.
What,

2046
01:27:13,690 --> 01:27:15,080
what is that about?
I don't even,

2047
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:19,880
I don't even know the exact specifics of
that case.

2048
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:20,980
You know,
I'll,

2049
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:23,330
I'll look it up.
Scientists trying to create son.

2050
01:27:24,850 --> 01:27:29,850
So a ufc comIng up.
It's crazy that he injured his shoulder 

2051
01:27:29,850 --> 01:27:29,850
hit.

2052
01:27:29,910 --> 01:27:31,470
That's not this ufc.
That was another one.

2053
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:34,090
What's one is a familiar one?
I think his,

2054
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:34,560
his,
uh,

2055
01:27:34,590 --> 01:27:39,590
his.
He was on the undercard of a rashad 

2056
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:39,590
evans,
I think.

2057
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:39,590
I don't know.
be honest with you.

2058
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:44,630
Yeah.
Nuclear fusion scientists attempt to 

2059
01:27:44,630 --> 01:27:47,661
create artificial sun on earth.
Oh,

2060
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:50,670
nothing's gonna happen wrong there.
That's definitely going to be fine.

2061
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:57,680
They're goIng to make a fucking son.
We're going to have a little portable 

2062
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:57,680
sons that exist all around the earth and
that's,

2063
01:27:57,950 --> 01:27:59,170
you know.
Yeah.

2064
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,110
Unless it blows up like the fucking oil 
town.

2065
01:28:01,111 --> 01:28:02,640
What if you have your own portable 
sunday?

2066
01:28:02,641 --> 01:28:04,080
Just followed me around and kept you 
warm.

2067
01:28:04,081 --> 01:28:09,081
Yeah.
Unless it blows up like the fucking oil 

2068
01:28:09,081 --> 01:28:09,081
tanker.
Could you Imagine?

2069
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,130
Why do you always look at the bright 
side of things?

2070
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:14,020
Why do you guys look at the bad side of 
things together?

2071
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:19,260
Out?
We're like the odd couple like tom and 

2072
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:19,260
jerry.
There's two things on the shoulder,

2073
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:21,300
like the devil and the angel.
Jerry.

2074
01:28:21,310 --> 01:28:24,570
ThIs animal house son.
Remember everything I guess.

2075
01:28:25,390 --> 01:28:26,770
Yeah.
It's been on a million things.

2076
01:28:26,771 --> 01:28:28,780
There was a comic that used to do an act
like that.

2077
01:28:28,781 --> 01:28:30,300
Norm macdonald was making fun of him.
Remember?

2078
01:28:30,790 --> 01:28:34,240
Remember he had like a logical,
logical left brain.

2079
01:28:34,241 --> 01:28:37,390
Right brain.
I'm so look,

2080
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:39,940
we don't know what the fuck is really 
happening with the smart dust,

2081
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:41,830
but you got to.

2082
01:28:41,980 --> 01:28:46,980
I can imagine snort and people were 
going to find a way to take a snort.

2083
01:28:46,981 --> 01:28:48,120
It may get high off of it.

2084
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:53,220
This,
this got high up the smart dose dude,

2085
01:28:53,410 --> 01:28:55,350
the hp shit.
Yeah.

2086
01:28:55,950 --> 01:28:58,380
This is hilarious.
The research that this is,

2087
01:28:58,381 --> 01:29:02,070
despite these differences,
researchers say the dust theory,

2088
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:06,930
that monitoring everything will benefit.
Humanity remains essentially unchanged.

2089
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:10,020
They believe that this will benefit 
humanity to monitor everything.

2090
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:13,980
Maybe.
I think they might be right.

2091
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:19,040
I think we might have to accept the fact
that technology is going to keep moving 

2092
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:19,890
forward and if technology keeps moving 
forward,

2093
01:29:19,891 --> 01:29:21,530
what is the end result?
What's,

2094
01:29:21,550 --> 01:29:23,040
what's going to be at the end of the 
rainbow?

2095
01:29:23,041 --> 01:29:23,760
What?
What is?

2096
01:29:24,210 --> 01:29:26,760
Is there a singularity as ray kurzweil 
would say,

2097
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:28,770
or you know,
terence mckenna says,

2098
01:29:28,810 --> 01:29:33,810
you know,
timewave zero know is there a moment of 

2099
01:29:33,810 --> 01:29:33,960
ultimate novelty,
a moment,

2100
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:39,020
a moment where they create something 
that's so fucking crazy that it changes 

2101
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:39,020
everything.
This is probabLy the beginning,

2102
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:43,971
man.
This smart dust shit is probably the 

2103
01:29:43,971 --> 01:29:43,971
fucking beginning.
You know,

2104
01:29:43,971 --> 01:29:45,010
google was probably the beginning.
That was a part of it.

2105
01:29:45,030 --> 01:29:46,980
Oh man.
Google's browser.

2106
01:29:46,990 --> 01:29:50,700
That chrome browser is fucking amazing.
It's my favorite browser by far.

2107
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:53,820
So this nuclear fusion thing,
this,

2108
01:29:53,821 --> 01:29:55,830
this,
these scientists trying to create this,

2109
01:29:56,130 --> 01:29:59,610
this actual artificial sun or you know,
a natural side.

2110
01:29:59,611 --> 01:30:00,750
Yes.
It would actually be a son.

2111
01:30:00,751 --> 01:30:03,480
I mean it's of the same elements of the 
stars may not have.

2112
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:04,560
Right?
I mean if it's a son,

2113
01:30:04,561 --> 01:30:06,870
it's a son.
It's not like a fake tit.

2114
01:30:06,930 --> 01:30:07,230
Right?

2115
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:09,290
Maybe it's the fucking son.
Well,

2116
01:30:09,291 --> 01:30:11,300
maybe they're just used throwing that 
name son around.

2117
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:15,430
It's just a really hot light bulb.
Well,

2118
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:16,400
it just seems.
Wait,

2119
01:30:16,401 --> 01:30:16,700
wait,
wait.

2120
01:30:16,730 --> 01:30:17,890
What's a son?
It's a planet.

2121
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:21,160
If you want to,
if you want to look it up.

2122
01:30:21,161 --> 01:30:23,770
It's in the telegraph.
Bright star as of yesterday.

2123
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:26,350
Oh no.
Okay.

2124
01:30:26,351 --> 01:30:31,351
No,
it was published in since it was 

2125
01:30:31,351 --> 01:30:31,351
published in 2008.

2126
01:30:31,351 --> 01:30:31,920
Two thousand eight.
All right.

2127
01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:33,410
Oh,
so I think they're moving.

2128
01:30:33,411 --> 01:30:34,710
No,
it's not a hope student there.

2129
01:30:34,770 --> 01:30:35,650
They're moving.
Oh my god.

2130
01:30:35,660 --> 01:30:36,860
Look at it.
Where it is right there.

2131
01:30:37,070 --> 01:30:39,140
Jesus christ.
This image of this thing.

2132
01:30:39,141 --> 01:30:41,840
It's like a fucking x men inside the 
target chamber.

2133
01:30:41,841 --> 01:30:44,180
We're scientists will attempt to create 
an artificial sun.

2134
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:46,640
What the fuck,
man?

2135
01:30:46,770 --> 01:30:48,030
Yeah,
but what's the latest update?

2136
01:30:48,290 --> 01:30:53,290
I don't know,
research shows that these two guys are 

2137
01:30:53,290 --> 01:30:55,490
just smoking.
A lot of weed didn't exist.

2138
01:30:56,161 --> 01:30:57,840
It was.
They just made it in a rush.

2139
01:30:58,260 --> 01:30:59,400
It's pretty fascinating when you

2140
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:04,480
listen to it.
While it seemed impossible goal for 

2141
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:06,911
nearly a hundred years,
scientists now believe they are at the 

2142
01:31:06,911 --> 01:31:09,431
break on the brake rather of cracking 
one of the biggest problems in physics 

2143
01:31:09,431 --> 01:31:11,270
by harnessing the power of nuclear 
fusion.

2144
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:16,580
the reaction that burns at the heart of 
the sudden they really think they could 

2145
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:16,580
do this.

2146
01:31:17,770 --> 01:31:18,310
Wow.

2147
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,120
Are people allowed to have like the,
the,

2148
01:31:22,121 --> 01:31:24,720
the,
the ingredients to make a son.

2149
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:26,270
But you know,
it seems like it.

2150
01:31:26,271 --> 01:31:28,690
You shouldn't be allowed to make,
have the ingredients to make science.

2151
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:29,440
Well,
I mean,

2152
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:35,010
what we can look at the manhattan 
project basically harness the power of 

2153
01:31:35,010 --> 01:31:35,010
his son.
You know,

2154
01:31:35,010 --> 01:31:36,010
that's a nuclear energy is right,

2155
01:31:36,380 --> 01:31:36,800
right.

2156
01:31:37,830 --> 01:31:42,830
Say you're not allowed to buy weed,
but you're allowed to make nuclear 

2157
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:43,560
explosions.

2158
01:31:44,970 --> 01:31:47,020
Fireball.
this is sort of an older story.

2159
01:31:47,021 --> 01:31:49,900
It seems like I'm fine and from 2008 
with no a

2160
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:51,220
no updates,
updates,

2161
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:55,240
find whatever that scientIst is names,
and then just google that guy's name and

2162
01:31:55,241 --> 01:31:58,230
then under more options in google,
click the last month.

2163
01:31:58,430 --> 01:32:00,260
You crazy.
Fuck.

2164
01:32:00,730 --> 01:32:02,110
Yeah,
it seems like december 27,

2165
01:32:02,111 --> 01:32:04,020
2008 is when the,
uh,

2166
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,780
now here's 2009 again.
Oh,

2167
01:32:06,790 --> 01:32:11,790
they're trying to make it in 2018.
That's when they believe that will be 

2168
01:32:11,790 --> 01:32:11,790
fine.
But those,

2169
01:32:11,790 --> 01:32:13,060
the bottom line is some shit is fucking 
happening.

2170
01:32:13,450 --> 01:32:14,710
That's the bottom line.
These,

2171
01:32:15,010 --> 01:32:17,630
while we think about tiger woods and you
know,

2172
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:22,800
you hear the news,
new show they're putting together to 

2173
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,860
trying to put together a show where 
tiger woods mistresses are the,

2174
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:27,310
a get together with Jesse James,
mr says,

2175
01:32:27,450 --> 01:32:29,700
and they got to search for love.
They're going to have like a game

2176
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:35,500
all together here to make it a porno.
Adam the one main porn star that 

2177
01:32:35,850 --> 01:32:38,480
supposedly fucked with tiger woods,
just making a poor.

2178
01:32:38,490 --> 01:32:40,430
Now with tiger woods.
Lookalikes,

2179
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:43,770
you could make,
you could make real shows with all those

2180
01:32:43,771 --> 01:32:45,600
girls and people would tune in every 
week.

2181
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:48,870
You could just put them as a cast,
that's what they should do,

2182
01:32:48,871 --> 01:32:53,871
like a scandal that comes out,
they should take the cast members and 

2183
01:32:53,871 --> 01:32:55,650
put them as a cast on other shows like 
you know,

2184
01:32:55,651 --> 01:32:57,990
like they'll start out with like a,
you know,

2185
01:32:57,991 --> 01:33:00,000
you put them on the apprentice,
you know,

2186
01:33:00,001 --> 01:33:02,130
like see if you can figure out a way to 
make a business,

2187
01:33:02,131 --> 01:33:03,030
you know,
now you know,

2188
01:33:03,090 --> 01:33:04,890
you don't have any more money coming 
from tiger.

2189
01:33:05,090 --> 01:33:06,330
You've got to figure out what you're 
gonna do.

2190
01:33:06,331 --> 01:33:07,980
You're going to have to make money and 
you're in the public eye.

2191
01:33:07,981 --> 01:33:12,981
So let's put you on tv.
So they get on the apprentice and they 

2192
01:33:12,981 --> 01:33:12,981
try to figure out if they can start a 
business.

2193
01:33:12,981 --> 01:33:13,200
Well that's no good.
Well,

2194
01:33:13,230 --> 01:33:14,760
uh oh,
I always wanted to be a singer.

2195
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:15,870
Okay.
American idol.

2196
01:33:15,871 --> 01:33:17,670
And you put them all the whole american 
idol.

2197
01:33:17,671 --> 01:33:19,540
The whole season tigers.
Mr says,

2198
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:21,160
well,
you can't sing.

2199
01:33:21,180 --> 01:33:26,180
Can you dance?
And put them on dancing with the stars 

2200
01:33:26,180 --> 01:33:26,730
all the whole season.
Tigers misses on dancing with the stars.

2201
01:33:27,150 --> 01:33:27,830
You know,
I mean,

2202
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:34,000
I mean how many more fucking,
how many more of these stupid stories 

2203
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,760
can we have?
Wild shit is going on like people trying

2204
01:33:35,761 --> 01:33:40,761
to create songs and you know,
and these little tiny sensors that go 

2205
01:33:40,761 --> 01:33:44,121
over the world,
how many people are aware of the smart 

2206
01:33:44,121 --> 01:33:44,121
dust stuff,
the pr,

2207
01:33:44,121 --> 01:33:45,990
the amount that this should be a huge 
fucking story.

2208
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:48,630
There should be something that makes 
everybody's jaw drop.

2209
01:33:48,810 --> 01:33:50,640
When you step back and go,
what are they gonna do?

2210
01:33:50,641 --> 01:33:54,120
They're gonna monitor everything.
What does that mean?

2211
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:55,500
What does that go?
Does that mean?

2212
01:33:55,501 --> 01:34:00,501
I mean,
when is it going to start with just 

2213
01:34:00,501 --> 01:34:00,501
little bits of information like there's 
a,

2214
01:34:00,501 --> 01:34:01,740
there's a person in this area as they 
can eventually get to a point where they

2215
01:34:01,741 --> 01:34:06,090
can have your image and you could see 
everything everywhere and eventually are

2216
01:34:06,091 --> 01:34:08,100
they going to get to a point where 
you're going to be able to tap into that

2217
01:34:08,101 --> 01:34:08,890
shit with your fucking.

2218
01:34:09,530 --> 01:34:12,320
It just seems like there should be 
voting before this would ever happen for

2219
01:34:12,321 --> 01:34:12,560
real,

2220
01:34:12,620 --> 01:34:17,620
but there's not.
There's no voting on whether or not we 

2221
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:19,481
go to Afghanistan.
You vote a president in and then the 

2222
01:34:19,481 --> 01:34:21,020
president gets to decide all sorts of 
fucked up shit that nobody wants.

2223
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:23,360
If you allow the american people to 
decide,

2224
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:26,870
90 percent of the shit we got involved 
in would never happen,

2225
01:34:26,871 --> 01:34:29,150
so we have it set up where you don't get
to decide.

2226
01:34:29,270 --> 01:34:33,200
You get to decide on who gets to decide.
That's what you get to decide on,

2227
01:34:33,350 --> 01:34:35,810
which is fucking ridiculous because the 
idea that one,

2228
01:34:35,811 --> 01:34:40,811
gosh should be trusted to fucking run 
everything in this day and age where as 

2229
01:34:40,811 --> 01:34:41,780
much as we know about how complicated 
the world is,

2230
01:34:41,930 --> 01:34:45,260
that's fucking nonsense.
That's total nonsense,

2231
01:34:45,470 --> 01:34:50,470
but yet we accept it.
The right way to do it would be to have 

2232
01:34:50,470 --> 01:34:54,701
everybody vote on things.
The problem with that is people are 

2233
01:34:54,701 --> 01:34:55,340
fucking stupid.
They're really easy to manipulate.

2234
01:34:55,370 --> 01:35:00,370
You could.
You could tell them all sorts of shit 

2235
01:35:00,370 --> 01:35:02,110
not true,
and the dumb ones would all buy it and 

2236
01:35:02,110 --> 01:35:02,600
the dumb ones are more than half.
So now what do you do?

2237
01:35:02,990 --> 01:35:06,170
So it's almost like you have to have 
someone who you think is pretty smart to

2238
01:35:06,171 --> 01:35:11,171
get into power so that he could make the
decisions for you guys and look out for 

2239
01:35:11,171 --> 01:35:14,351
your best interest,
but that's when money gets involved and 

2240
01:35:14,351 --> 01:35:14,840
they get fucking corporations and the 
corporations come the long money to make

2241
01:35:14,841 --> 01:35:17,300
sure that you get an office.
But once you get an office like yo man,

2242
01:35:17,301 --> 01:35:22,301
like we really like the oil that we're 
getting from the amazon jungle and we 

2243
01:35:22,301 --> 01:35:22,760
like to keep getting that shit.
And you know,

2244
01:35:22,761 --> 01:35:24,500
there's some places we like to cut down 
some trees.

2245
01:35:24,501 --> 01:35:25,770
There's a lot of bitches.
Hayden

2246
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:28,000
got you.
I got you.

2247
01:35:28,030 --> 01:35:29,190
I got you.
You want the trees?

2248
01:35:29,380 --> 01:35:30,140
It was good.

2249
01:35:30,670 --> 01:35:35,670
This is what we do.
We're going to go over there and we'll 

2250
01:35:35,670 --> 01:35:35,670
give them a giant as loan.
They can't pay back.

2251
01:35:35,670 --> 01:35:35,910
And then when they can't pay it back a 
little jack,

2252
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:36,760
um,
take their shit.

2253
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,610
And we've been doing that since fucking 
the beginning of time.

2254
01:35:39,790 --> 01:35:44,790
There's,
there's money involved and when there's 

2255
01:35:44,790 --> 01:35:44,790
money involved,
you can ever have a real power.

2256
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:49,860
The real power can't be isolated in one 
area and they can't be like all this 

2257
01:35:49,860 --> 01:35:53,940
influence where like one group or one 
person or one organization gets to 

2258
01:35:53,940 --> 01:35:58,861
control shit because then everybody's 
going to be trying to kiss ass to that 

2259
01:35:58,861 --> 01:35:59,620
organization to get them to do what they
want so that they can,

2260
01:35:59,650 --> 01:36:02,440
they can conduct business and that's 
what we're dealing with.

2261
01:36:02,650 --> 01:36:07,650
That's why people can't vote for 
everything because a real democracy 

2262
01:36:07,650 --> 01:36:07,650
would wouldn't work.
We're,

2263
01:36:07,650 --> 01:36:09,680
we're,
we're fucking babies were infantiles.

2264
01:36:10,210 --> 01:36:13,210
There's no way with the way we've been 
living our society,

2265
01:36:13,211 --> 01:36:15,970
like were there some big daddy looking 
out for us?

2266
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:21,200
You know,
there's no way we can go from that to 

2267
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:22,060
like being able to be completely free 
and vote for everything that happens.

2268
01:36:22,061 --> 01:36:25,570
It'd be too complicated right now.
That's just going to take a long time,

2269
01:36:25,571 --> 01:36:26,680
but I don't think it's ever going to 
happen.

2270
01:36:26,860 --> 01:36:31,570
I think something's going to just bypass
it and launch our culture and launch our

2271
01:36:31,571 --> 01:36:36,571
civilization and to the next stage.
I think we're never going to evolve as 

2272
01:36:36,571 --> 01:36:36,970
we are in this,
in this form.

2273
01:36:37,150 --> 01:36:42,150
I think this forum is all about fucking 
and violence and chaos and laughter and 

2274
01:36:42,641 --> 01:36:44,500
nonsense.
That's this life,

2275
01:36:44,740 --> 01:36:49,740
this life,
this life is all about love and 

2276
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:51,520
friendships and shit you like to do and 
fun and it's hang on,

2277
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:56,380
hang on to the big ship that is humanity
because some shit is going to change and

2278
01:36:56,381 --> 01:36:59,380
you're about to go through a new door 
and when we go through that new door,

2279
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:04,440
all this shit that you even worrying 
about about whether or not you should 

2280
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:06,990
get a mac or a pc or whether or not 
you're a democrat or republican or 

2281
01:37:06,990 --> 01:37:09,130
whether or not you like family guy or 
fucking fuck those hooks.

2282
01:37:09,130 --> 01:37:10,500
I like south park.
You know?

2283
01:37:10,570 --> 01:37:15,570
That's all going to be nonsense when the
big change happens and I think it's 

2284
01:37:15,570 --> 01:37:17,860
common.
I think it is really fucking comment and

2285
01:37:17,861 --> 01:37:21,220
I think you see things like this little 
smart dust thing and you see things like

2286
01:37:21,221 --> 01:37:26,221
people trying to create sons and you see
things like what's going on with with 

2287
01:37:26,221 --> 01:37:26,830
the fucking oil spill,
where this going to be?

2288
01:37:26,831 --> 01:37:31,831
Some radical changes.
The way people approach extracting oil 

2289
01:37:31,831 --> 01:37:34,771
from the ground.
Now people are going to demand this is 

2290
01:37:34,771 --> 01:37:34,771
going to be a catastrophe,
you know,

2291
01:37:34,771 --> 01:37:38,641
I think some shit is change and I think 
shit is so freaky,

2292
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:44,740
freaky to think that this ridiculous 
notion of 2012 being,

2293
01:37:44,741 --> 01:37:49,741
you know,
the end of humanity that is a date you 

2294
01:37:49,741 --> 01:37:50,470
can actually track that.
It seems like it's happening that way.

2295
01:37:50,860 --> 01:37:53,950
It really would not be shocked if 
december 20,

2296
01:37:53,951 --> 01:37:58,951
first 2012 actually does turn out to be 
some sort of crazy invention or insane 

2297
01:38:00,871 --> 01:38:04,430
innovation that catapults the human race
into the next stage.

2298
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,080
You guys are going to be,
it's going to be nothing.

2299
01:38:07,220 --> 01:38:10,700
It's going to be completely nothing.
It's going to be like turning 2000.

2300
01:38:11,380 --> 01:38:14,000
It's going to be like the computer virus
that it might not be

2301
01:38:14,030 --> 01:38:15,460
dude,
or it might happen before then.

2302
01:38:15,461 --> 01:38:16,710
I mean,
it might be a rough estimate,

2303
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:21,950
but I think there's going to be 
something that takes place and I think 

2304
01:38:21,950 --> 01:38:21,950
it's going to involve.

2305
01:38:21,950 --> 01:38:23,950
La has been added earthquake.
I think that's definitely gonna happen.

2306
01:38:23,990 --> 01:38:24,730
I think so,
yeah.

2307
01:38:24,790 --> 01:38:28,360
I think that's just lately I,
everyday on my,

2308
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:30,310
uh,
chrome or my homepage,

2309
01:38:30,430 --> 01:38:32,470
the thing that pops up is my google 
page.

2310
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:36,220
One of the things my widgets is the 
earthquake map for los angeles.

2311
01:38:36,550 --> 01:38:41,550
And if you've been watching ever since 
that earthquake in san diego for the 

2312
01:38:41,550 --> 01:38:41,550
last,
what was that?

2313
01:38:41,550 --> 01:38:43,120
A month and a half ago?
Squeak expert?

2314
01:38:43,121 --> 01:38:44,570
Or is this just rambling?
No,

2315
01:38:44,590 --> 01:38:45,950
this is.
I see the same eye.

2316
01:38:45,951 --> 01:38:50,951
I've Been falling earthquakes just as a 
hobby I guess for the last seven years I

2317
01:38:51,641 --> 01:38:55,400
go to this website that just shows like 
the earthquake map can do it.

2318
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:57,430
If you believe in the secret,
you're creating earthquakes,

2319
01:38:57,431 --> 01:38:57,790
right?
No,

2320
01:38:57,791 --> 01:38:58,060
no,
no,

2321
01:38:58,061 --> 01:38:58,950
I'm not.
But anyways,

2322
01:38:58,951 --> 01:39:03,951
like manifesting it current earthquakes 
and ever freak you goddamn earthquake 

2323
01:39:03,951 --> 01:39:05,210
projection center.
Yeah.

2324
01:39:05,211 --> 01:39:07,360
It just shows you that the earthquakes 
recently,

2325
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:10,180
but ever since the san diego,
san diego earthquake,

2326
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:13,240
there has been so much activity in 
Mexico,

2327
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:18,360
like maybe,
maybe 100 times more than it normally 

2328
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:18,360
is.

2329
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:22,560
Like just,
well this one's an earthquake right 

2330
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:23,080
under the house of some crazy mexican 
drug dealer.

2331
01:39:23,110 --> 01:39:28,110
I know that's what I'm saying.
You need to put a layer drug dealer in 

2332
01:39:28,110 --> 01:39:30,920
layer map over this google map to see 
what's going on because ever since then,

2333
01:39:30,921 --> 01:39:33,340
like a month and a half ago,
it's been retarded.

2334
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:36,040
You have a fear of earthquakes.
I don't have a fear,

2335
01:39:36,041 --> 01:39:37,990
but I'm interested in them and it's just
weird.

2336
01:39:37,991 --> 01:39:40,360
Like everyday,
like right in the last whatever,

2337
01:39:40,390 --> 01:39:45,390
couple of days a week there's been 920 
earthquakes in los angeles or in 

2338
01:39:45,390 --> 01:39:46,900
California and usually that hovers about
that same number.

2339
01:39:47,050 --> 01:39:52,050
LaTely though,
almost all of them have been in san 

2340
01:39:52,050 --> 01:39:52,050
diego

2341
01:39:52,050 --> 01:39:52,400
so much.
Shit that can fuck us up man.

2342
01:39:52,580 --> 01:39:54,470
There's so much focus on.

2343
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:57,300
I have an earthquake fetish.
That's right.

2344
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,720
Oh,
I got another good story.

2345
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:03,140
Let me make a out about how about this 
guy who.

2346
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:06,410
The courtesy of the pee pee pee bucket.
You can't even hold on.

2347
01:40:07,990 --> 01:40:09,500
Wait up here in the flashlight.
oh,

2348
01:40:09,501 --> 01:40:12,890
don't do that.
Don't go in the bathroom while you go in

2349
01:40:12,891 --> 01:40:13,640
the bathroom.
I'll take.

2350
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:16,400
I'll take questions and when he comes 
back from the bathroom,

2351
01:40:16,401 --> 01:40:21,401
we're going to talk about this dude.
His name is george wreckers and he is a 

2352
01:40:21,401 --> 01:40:23,480
christian right leader and he just got 
busted with a twink.

2353
01:40:25,250 --> 01:40:26,600
I love these stories,
man.

2354
01:40:26,601 --> 01:40:30,740
This dude is like this real staunch anti
gay activist.

2355
01:40:30,741 --> 01:40:35,741
He's a,
he's a board member of something called 

2356
01:40:35,741 --> 01:40:35,741
the national association for,
uh,

2357
01:40:35,741 --> 01:40:38,660
research therapy of homosexuality.

2358
01:40:41,690 --> 01:40:44,330
And it turns out he's really gay.
it turns out that,

2359
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:49,360
you know,
he was trying to pass all this 

2360
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:49,360
legislation.
He was a,

2361
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:53,080
he's in the american college of 
pediatrics or have pediatricians and 

2362
01:40:53,381 --> 01:40:55,750
apparently the America american college 
of pediatricians.

2363
01:40:55,751 --> 01:41:00,751
ThAt's like the name of it,
but it really like they hand out 

2364
01:41:00,751 --> 01:41:00,751
literature according to this one 
website,

2365
01:41:00,751 --> 01:41:03,880
choosing gays have something called 
copper ofelia,

2366
01:41:03,910 --> 01:41:08,910
clp r o p h I l I a,
which means sexuality while playing with

2367
01:41:10,541 --> 01:41:11,880
shit,
copper ofelia.

2368
01:41:11,930 --> 01:41:15,970
So they were accusing gains of this 
copper ofelia,

2369
01:41:15,971 --> 01:41:17,270
this failure,
this obsession,

2370
01:41:17,271 --> 01:41:21,490
the sickness and you know,
and saying how terrible gays are and how

2371
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:25,060
adopted children that are adopted.
Gay families are all fucked up.

2372
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:29,400
And meanwhile this dude,
the entire time was banging dudes.

2373
01:41:29,510 --> 01:41:32,230
It's really goddamn classic.
He was,

2374
01:41:32,290 --> 01:41:36,190
he was caught on vacation with something
called a rent boy.

2375
01:41:36,490 --> 01:41:41,020
He went to rent boy.com
rent boy.com.

2376
01:41:41,021 --> 01:41:43,450
and this is what he advertised for the 
guy.

2377
01:41:43,451 --> 01:41:46,390
This is the guy that he went with.
He has a smooth,

2378
01:41:46,391 --> 01:41:51,391
sweet,
tight ass and a perfectly built eight 

2379
01:41:51,391 --> 01:41:54,721
inch cock uncut and,
and explains that he is sensual wild and

2380
01:41:56,020 --> 01:41:58,290
up for anything.
So the cash.

2381
01:41:58,291 --> 01:42:02,350
this dude george records of north miami,
they catch him,

2382
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:05,140
the leading scholar for the christian,
right?

2383
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:10,380
They catch him at a terminal with this 
gay escort and started taking pictures 

2384
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:11,320
and this is what the guys excuse was he 
says,

2385
01:42:11,321 --> 01:42:14,740
I had surgery,
I can't lift luggage.

2386
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,170
That's why I hired him.

2387
01:42:16,190 --> 01:42:21,190
Him.
That's fucking awesome.

2388
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:22,870
And is pretty good.
That's awesome.

2389
01:42:22,871 --> 01:42:25,740
I think the tickle parties,
boy.com,

2390
01:42:26,420 --> 01:42:31,420
if you were a gay dude and you were so 
tired of people fucking with other gay 

2391
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:34,901
dudes.
And so coming up with all these laws 

2392
01:42:34,901 --> 01:42:37,631
that make it impossible for you to get 
married and make it more difficult for 

2393
01:42:37,631 --> 01:42:38,300
you to adopt children and make it more 
difficult for you to,

2394
01:42:38,301 --> 01:42:40,580
you know,
get all sorts of shit.

2395
01:42:40,610 --> 01:42:41,060
You know,
that,

2396
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:44,420
that shouldn't be denied from you 
because of your sexual preference.

2397
01:42:44,421 --> 01:42:46,460
If you're not doing anything to harm 
anybody else,

2398
01:42:46,550 --> 01:42:49,310
it's ridiculous.
They wouldn't even entertain that.

2399
01:42:49,311 --> 01:42:54,311
There's something wrong with it.
And this one motherfuckers just going 

2400
01:42:54,311 --> 01:42:56,870
off just involved in so much,
so much legislation,

2401
01:42:56,871 --> 01:42:57,410
so much.

2402
01:42:57,510 --> 01:43:02,510
So much activism against homosexuals.
And meanwhile this fucking dude advisory

2403
01:43:04,531 --> 01:43:06,930
roles with congress,
the white house department of health and

2404
01:43:06,931 --> 01:43:11,931
human services and testifying in a 
state's witness in the favor of 

2405
01:43:11,931 --> 01:43:11,931
florida's gay adoption ban.

2406
01:43:11,931 --> 01:43:15,810
motherfuckers going to rent boy.com
getting twinks.

2407
01:43:16,170 --> 01:43:18,330
He's getting twinks.
If you know what twain started twinks or

2408
01:43:18,350 --> 01:43:23,350
the the little boys that gay dudes like 
gay dudes like 19 year old boys are 

2409
01:43:23,350 --> 01:43:23,480
like,
I'll have any muscle.

2410
01:43:23,481 --> 01:43:27,760
And they look like little boys twinks.
This dude was going and getting twink.

2411
01:43:27,770 --> 01:43:32,770
Twinks had surgery.
Surgery was twilight fans or something 

2412
01:43:34,231 --> 01:43:35,270
like that?
No,

2413
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:36,750
no.
Twinks,

2414
01:43:36,751 --> 01:43:40,740
the original twinks is a little,
a little gay dudes.

2415
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:42,300
My mom's rude.
Dang,

2416
01:43:42,301 --> 01:43:44,250
because she was calling me a twink.
Wow.

2417
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:46,890
Just called you a twink.
I'm sure your mom doesn't know what that

2418
01:43:46,891 --> 01:43:51,891
means.
Your mom's got some fucking betty boop 

2419
01:43:51,891 --> 01:43:51,891
definition of

2420
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:55,520
somebody that likes hard candy that she 
heard on little rascals.

2421
01:43:59,490 --> 01:44:02,200
You know,
whaT the fuck does she know that this is

2422
01:44:02,210 --> 01:44:03,070
like the ted haggard

2423
01:44:03,100 --> 01:44:05,050
case?
Just as good.

2424
01:44:05,380 --> 01:44:08,530
It's like so many of these cases.
There's been so many of them.

2425
01:44:08,531 --> 01:44:10,660
It's almost impossible to math.
Um,

2426
01:44:10,690 --> 01:44:11,670
you know,
uh,

2427
01:44:11,780 --> 01:44:13,030
god,
what was that guy's name?

2428
01:44:13,031 --> 01:44:15,340
That was a.
he worked for marc faber,

2429
01:44:15,490 --> 01:44:16,540
who was another guy,
right?

2430
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:19,330
there's been so many of them.
So many people that are,

2431
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:21,610
that are,
that are anti gay turn out to be gay.

2432
01:44:22,090 --> 01:44:25,780
it's a favorite.
The one that was trying to bank kids.

2433
01:44:25,781 --> 01:44:29,050
He was trying to bang.
He was gay and he was trying to bang his

2434
01:44:29,650 --> 01:44:32,050
assistance and his,
uh,

2435
01:44:32,710 --> 01:44:34,990
one of those congressional pages.
That's what he was doing.

2436
01:44:35,110 --> 01:44:36,040
I think that's his name.
Favor,

2437
01:44:36,070 --> 01:44:37,390
whatever.
If it's not,

2438
01:44:38,260 --> 01:44:40,470
you know the fuck I'm talking about it.
It's,

2439
01:44:40,610 --> 01:44:45,610
there's so many of these guys that are 
trying to fight against gay peopLe and 

2440
01:44:45,610 --> 01:44:47,920
trying to stop people from doing things 
and they turn out to be gay.

2441
01:44:48,130 --> 01:44:51,700
How do they not know that people are 
going to check this thing?

2442
01:44:52,780 --> 01:44:56,230
How do you.
How do you not know that if you're a guy

2443
01:44:56,231 --> 01:45:01,231
who's like just spending an exorbitant 
amount of time trying to fight the gay 

2444
01:45:01,231 --> 01:45:03,160
agenda,
trying to stop gays,

2445
01:45:03,161 --> 01:45:07,390
were having the same rights as straight 
couples trying to just suppress people.

2446
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:09,370
Wouldn't you think they would look at 
you?

2447
01:45:09,900 --> 01:45:11,080
What do you think?
They will check you out?

2448
01:45:12,330 --> 01:45:14,880
It seems like it's so weird when it's 
always the loudest person.

2449
01:45:14,881 --> 01:45:15,850
That's nice.

2450
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:19,480
It's an incredible.
The suppression of others for no reason.

2451
01:45:19,481 --> 01:45:24,481
When you look into someone trying to 
suppress someone else's wants and 

2452
01:45:24,481 --> 01:45:27,391
desires for no reason,
you have to look at that person and you 

2453
01:45:27,391 --> 01:45:29,200
have to scrutinize where they're coming 
from because that's not natural.

2454
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:31,330
That's not a natural thing.
Like why would you care?

2455
01:45:31,331 --> 01:45:31,880
They're,
they're gay.

2456
01:45:31,881 --> 01:45:33,310
They're having fun.
You know what do you give a shit?

2457
01:45:33,311 --> 01:45:35,080
As long as he doesn't try to fuck you,
you,

2458
01:45:35,081 --> 01:45:37,120
you shouldn't have a problem with them.
You know,

2459
01:45:37,150 --> 01:45:39,310
there's a bunch of gay people,
they find the other gay people,

2460
01:45:39,311 --> 01:45:40,780
they have a good party together.
Who cares?

2461
01:45:40,810 --> 01:45:42,080
Why do you care?
You know?

2462
01:45:42,110 --> 01:45:47,110
That doesn't make sense if you care.
But if you do care and you're out there 

2463
01:45:47,110 --> 01:45:47,380
fighting and man,
we got you.

2464
01:45:47,381 --> 01:45:48,890
We know now.
It's like,

2465
01:45:48,891 --> 01:45:50,640
it's obvious.
It's all of you.

2466
01:45:50,970 --> 01:45:52,510
You know what I mean?
How many of you,

2467
01:45:52,540 --> 01:45:54,250
how many of you,
the Larry Craig guy?

2468
01:45:54,251 --> 01:45:54,770
I mean,
how,

2469
01:45:54,790 --> 01:45:56,690
how many of you have to get busted?
It's,

2470
01:45:56,740 --> 01:45:58,750
it's,
it's fucking bananas.

2471
01:45:59,550 --> 01:46:02,390
Shit's bananas.
Bananas.

2472
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:06,220
Bananas is sponsored by chiquita.
I should be.

2473
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:11,500
Yeah,
but I'm going to be sponsored by the 

2474
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:11,500
fresh water because fucking my manager 
and kiss my ass by the way.

2475
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:14,140
I can't stop thinking about this 
ridiculous dumb fuckers.

2476
01:46:14,390 --> 01:46:15,600
Don't fuck it.
I kissed it.

2477
01:46:15,770 --> 01:46:20,770
Tasted real to it.
I hope some big fat,

2478
01:46:22,011 --> 01:46:27,011
sweaty dude was inspected by number two.
It was perfect.

2479
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:34,010
Yeah.
There's another senator.

2480
01:46:34,011 --> 01:46:35,990
They got busted watching porn and 
congress.

2481
01:46:35,991 --> 01:46:37,860
That's hilarious.
Yeah.

2482
01:46:38,750 --> 01:46:43,750
There's too many fucking people out 
there telling other people how to live 

2483
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:47,111
their lives.
It's ridiculous and we shouldn't 

2484
01:46:47,111 --> 01:46:47,111
tolerate it anymore.
You know?

2485
01:46:47,111 --> 01:46:47,180
At a certain point in time we have to 
say,

2486
01:46:47,181 --> 01:46:49,130
fuck you.
That's enough.

2487
01:46:49,170 --> 01:46:50,310
You know,
it's too.

2488
01:46:50,370 --> 01:46:55,370
It's too crazy.
And every one of them that are telling 

2489
01:46:55,370 --> 01:46:56,100
people what to do with their lives and 
what they shouldn't be doing,

2490
01:46:56,101 --> 01:47:00,090
it doesn't hurt that every one of them 
are fucked up across the board.

2491
01:47:00,330 --> 01:47:04,290
Whether they're musLims and want to 
throw rocks at you for drawn pictures of

2492
01:47:04,291 --> 01:47:07,470
muhammad or dancing or the fucK it is.
Whether it's catholics,

2493
01:47:07,660 --> 01:47:10,200
whether no matter anybody that's trying 
to suppress your behavior,

2494
01:47:10,201 --> 01:47:13,230
they're all fucKed up.
If you're not hurting anybody else,

2495
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:15,870
you're fine.
Nobody's got this thing wired.

2496
01:47:15,990 --> 01:47:18,810
Nobody.
Nobody is control of the fucKing oil.

2497
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:23,960
Nobody Knows what's happening.
The one was pouring out of the ground 

2498
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:24,300
40,000
fucking a day,

2499
01:47:24,330 --> 01:47:26,520
brian,
at least who knows?

2500
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:32,600
There's no no answers folks,
and that's important because if we're 

2501
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:34,770
ever going to get past where we are now,
we have to realize that no one is.

2502
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:39,920
We can't leave the control to like 
someone who we think is more qualified 

2503
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:44,781
than us and someone who's on it,
like obama or the idea of obama or some 

2504
01:47:44,781 --> 01:47:46,710
any guy being president and being on it.
You can't be on the world.

2505
01:47:46,890 --> 01:47:48,960
You can't be on the country.
It's impossible.

2506
01:47:49,020 --> 01:47:54,020
Nobody can.
And we have to accept that and until we 

2507
01:47:54,020 --> 01:47:56,571
do,
we're going to fucking hurdle out of 

2508
01:47:56,571 --> 01:47:56,571
control.

2509
01:47:56,571 --> 01:47:59,760
I agree.
And even if we do accept it,

2510
01:47:59,850 --> 01:48:04,850
I think it's too late.
I think what's going to save us and 

2511
01:48:04,850 --> 01:48:05,580
what's going to change us is technology.
That's what I think.

2512
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:07,110
Yeah,
totally.

2513
01:48:07,111 --> 01:48:10,080
I think when we realized,
I think we're slowly starting to realize

2514
01:48:10,290 --> 01:48:12,780
how full of shit people are.
We're slowly starting to,

2515
01:48:12,810 --> 01:48:15,570
as we get more and more intrusive into 
people's lives,

2516
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:16,710
we're,
we're,

2517
01:48:16,770 --> 01:48:20,400
you know,
we're exposing like another level of,

2518
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:25,980
of understanding of human beings and 
busting politicians and busting.

2519
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:31,100
I mean,
there was stuff like that guy that got 

2520
01:48:31,100 --> 01:48:31,100
busted.
Uh,

2521
01:48:31,100 --> 01:48:32,220
elliot spitzer.
Spitzer.

2522
01:48:32,221 --> 01:48:33,060
Yeah.
In New York.

2523
01:48:33,270 --> 01:48:34,860
I mean,
nobody got busted like that before.

2524
01:48:34,890 --> 01:48:37,050
Nobody's ever gotten better happening in
jail now.

2525
01:48:37,230 --> 01:48:37,590
Well,
you know,

2526
01:48:37,591 --> 01:48:40,470
that guy was a guy that was a very vocal
about the market,

2527
01:48:40,530 --> 01:48:43,040
about the market being all fucked up and
corrupt and you know,

2528
01:48:43,041 --> 01:48:48,041
and,
and talking about all these companies 

2529
01:48:48,041 --> 01:48:49,700
and he believes that that's one of the 
reasons why they went after him and 

2530
01:48:49,700 --> 01:48:50,280
that's why they're one of the reasons 
why they prosecuted,

2531
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:51,360
persecuted him.

2532
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:56,720
Meanwhile,
the guy was busting people for 

2533
01:48:56,720 --> 01:48:57,210
prostitution and he was using 
prostitutes,

2534
01:48:57,330 --> 01:48:58,260
you know,
he was like,

2535
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:03,320
that was like another example.
He was a guy that was like all adamant 

2536
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:03,570
against we're going to stop 
prostitution.

2537
01:49:03,571 --> 01:49:04,920
like,
oh,

2538
01:49:05,070 --> 01:49:08,180
what a good thing to stop.
Stop people getting their dick sucked.

2539
01:49:08,190 --> 01:49:08,500
Like,
well,

2540
01:49:08,580 --> 01:49:11,220
why would you do that?
Why don't you give a shit?

2541
01:49:11,430 --> 01:49:13,110
You got to really put so much effort 
into that.

2542
01:49:13,230 --> 01:49:18,230
Well,
it turns out the reason why he's doing 

2543
01:49:18,230 --> 01:49:18,230
this because you just covering up the 
fact that he's using them.

2544
01:49:18,230 --> 01:49:21,860
Like why wouldn't he is no different 
than all these crazy gay activists that 

2545
01:49:21,860 --> 01:49:23,280
are secretly gay.
You know,

2546
01:49:23,550 --> 01:49:26,160
he's hating.
He is trying to cover it up.

2547
01:49:27,050 --> 01:49:29,480
So we should look at anyone that's like 
a huge,

2548
01:49:29,481 --> 01:49:34,481
like loud person on a certain topic,
like the guy that likes slim jim's that 

2549
01:49:34,481 --> 01:49:38,351
went to snap into slim seems probably 
hates seeing it correctly at all the 

2550
01:49:39,890 --> 01:49:44,890
time.
I was just joking the what we have to 

2551
01:49:44,890 --> 01:49:44,890
look in as anyone.

2552
01:49:44,890 --> 01:49:45,630
The formula,
in my opinion,

2553
01:49:45,690 --> 01:49:47,500
and this is what I've seen to have out 
of it.

2554
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:52,980
You have to look at anyone that is 
trying to suppress the behavior or the 

2555
01:49:52,980 --> 01:49:56,290
desires of anyone else where it 
shouldn't concern them.

2556
01:49:56,860 --> 01:50:01,860
Whether it's someone who is trying to 
stop you from whatever the fuck it is,

2557
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:04,390
whether it's masturbation,
whether it's anything.

2558
01:50:04,570 --> 01:50:07,240
If they're trying to suppress your 
desire,

2559
01:50:07,270 --> 01:50:09,960
if they're trying to stop you from 
marrying other gay people,

2560
01:50:10,090 --> 01:50:11,800
stop gay rights,
look at them,

2561
01:50:12,010 --> 01:50:13,930
look at them,
find out what the fuck it is.

2562
01:50:14,110 --> 01:50:16,420
They're trying to suppress prostitute.
We gotta stop prostitution.

2563
01:50:16,630 --> 01:50:21,630
Find that guy.
He's getting his dick sucked is paying 

2564
01:50:21,630 --> 01:50:21,630
for it.
He's a fucking freak.

2565
01:50:21,630 --> 01:50:25,381
He's a freak and he's crazy.
All the people that are trying to 

2566
01:50:25,381 --> 01:50:27,931
suppress people from doing things that 
don't affect the person who's trying to 

2567
01:50:27,931 --> 01:50:28,630
stop them from suppressing things.

2568
01:50:29,270 --> 01:50:32,590
Just leave people the fuck alone and if 
you don't lead people to fuck alone,

2569
01:50:32,860 --> 01:50:34,240
you're the problem.
You know,

2570
01:50:34,241 --> 01:50:36,160
and that's really what It is.
This eliot spitzer guy,

2571
01:50:36,161 --> 01:50:36,700
you know?
Yeah.

2572
01:50:36,701 --> 01:50:38,560
Maybe you were exposing,
you know,

2573
01:50:38,570 --> 01:50:40,390
these,
these flaws in the market.

2574
01:50:40,391 --> 01:50:42,370
Maybe you were exposing corruption,
but guess what?

2575
01:50:42,371 --> 01:50:44,500
douche bag.
You were also getting people locked in a

2576
01:50:44,501 --> 01:50:47,200
cage because somebody gave somebody 
money to get their dick sucked,

2577
01:50:47,410 --> 01:50:52,090
which is fucking nonsense.
In 2010 you can,

2578
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:55,480
you can go to jail because you can suck 
someone's dick for free,

2579
01:50:55,660 --> 01:50:58,060
but if they give you $5,
you're a bad person.

2580
01:50:58,450 --> 01:51:00,910
That's ridiculous.
It is ridiculous.

2581
01:51:01,780 --> 01:51:04,680
That's completely ridiculous.
And then any,

2582
01:51:04,690 --> 01:51:09,690
anyone who's trying to suppress anybody 
else's desires or needs and they're 

2583
01:51:11,111 --> 01:51:13,870
trying to suppress them in a way that it
has nothing to do with them.

2584
01:51:14,050 --> 01:51:14,940
You got to look at them.
They're,

2585
01:51:14,950 --> 01:51:16,120
they're all,
they're all fucked up.

2586
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:18,960
They're all doing something shitty.
Yeah,

2587
01:51:19,210 --> 01:51:20,650
I agree.
I'm glad you agree with me.

2588
01:51:21,750 --> 01:51:24,430
That was a.
That ramp tapered off at the end,

2589
01:51:24,431 --> 01:51:25,160
right?
It's pretty good.

2590
01:51:25,161 --> 01:51:27,070
At the beginning I had an important 
point,

2591
01:51:27,071 --> 01:51:29,670
but somewhere around there,
through our market,

2592
01:51:29,671 --> 01:51:30,710
these things,
you just,

2593
01:51:30,950 --> 01:51:34,170
you lose the creative magic in 
formulating your sentences.

2594
01:51:35,010 --> 01:51:36,360
You know,
I like your setup this week.

2595
01:51:36,361 --> 01:51:41,361
It's awesome,
but one thing I think I just killed 

2596
01:51:41,361 --> 01:51:41,361
sperm,
that laptop on my lap,

2597
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:43,500
just cooked my boss.
What are you going to do it like?

2598
01:51:43,501 --> 01:51:45,660
I do it.
You have the laptop off to the side.

2599
01:51:45,690 --> 01:51:47,790
That's the move is if you put your 
laptop,

2600
01:51:47,791 --> 01:51:52,791
if you move this thing and you put your 
laptop like you put your microphone 

2601
01:51:52,791 --> 01:51:54,990
here.
Folks were fucking ghetto stuff.

2602
01:51:55,050 --> 01:52:00,050
Planned out situation there.
So we've covered everything that I want 

2603
01:52:00,050 --> 01:52:02,580
to cover as far as ufc predictions.

2604
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:07,580
People Keep asking me use predictions.
I never give you a few predictions 

2605
01:52:07,580 --> 01:52:07,580
because who the fucK knows it's going to
happen?

2606
01:52:07,580 --> 01:52:11,790
I'm the super exciting fights.
The main event of course is spectacular.

2607
01:52:12,030 --> 01:52:15,240
Leo machida versus mauricio shogun who a
very,

2608
01:52:15,241 --> 01:52:16,770
very interesting fight.
You know,

2609
01:52:16,860 --> 01:52:19,530
a lot of people thought that maricio won
the first fight,

2610
01:52:19,531 --> 01:52:21,000
but if he did win it,
you know,

2611
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:22,530
he didn't,
you know,

2612
01:52:22,531 --> 01:52:23,670
it didn't kill him.
He didn't,

2613
01:52:23,671 --> 01:52:24,950
he didn't really,
um,

2614
01:52:25,350 --> 01:52:26,490
you know,
he didn't stop him.

2615
01:52:26,491 --> 01:52:31,491
He never really heard him badly.
He never really had a real dominant 

2616
01:52:31,491 --> 01:52:32,160
moment in the fight.
He just edged them.

2617
01:52:32,161 --> 01:52:35,340
A lot of people felt like he edged them 
and a very exciting fight.

2618
01:52:35,610 --> 01:52:36,960
And I tHink that,
you know,

2619
01:52:36,970 --> 01:52:41,970
leonardo is going to have a completely 
different strategy most likely for this 

2620
01:52:41,970 --> 01:52:45,171
flight.
Very excited to see that he's a very 

2621
01:52:45,171 --> 01:52:45,171
strategic dude.

2622
01:52:45,171 --> 01:52:47,900
And uh,
I think also he's going to be the both 

2623
01:52:47,900 --> 01:52:49,791
guys got to be more prepared.
They're going to know what the other is 

2624
01:52:49,791 --> 01:52:53,051
capable of.
They're going to review the first fight 

2625
01:52:53,051 --> 01:52:54,020
and go over mistakes,
go over when they landed and you know,

2626
01:52:54,021 --> 01:52:57,380
and go over like maybe tendencies that 
each might have that might,

2627
01:52:57,410 --> 01:52:59,240
maybe they can exploit.
So I think it does.

2628
01:52:59,270 --> 01:53:01,910
The second fight is going to start out a
chess match.

2629
01:53:02,150 --> 01:53:05,930
Now they're going to be a both guys 
going to be doing things that they think

2630
01:53:05,931 --> 01:53:10,931
are going to benefit them in this fight 
that maybe they didn't do in the first 

2631
01:53:10,931 --> 01:53:13,871
flight.
Maybe we'll find guys might start off 

2632
01:53:13,871 --> 01:53:13,871
the fight a little bit more cautious.
That could be interesting.

2633
01:53:13,871 --> 01:53:15,800
You know,
cfo maybe show them,

2634
01:53:15,801 --> 01:53:20,801
plays the role of a counter striker 
initially or maybe they Just get to it 

2635
01:53:20,801 --> 01:53:21,350
like it's around six.

2636
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:22,940
Maybe they just fucking go out each 
other.

2637
01:53:22,941 --> 01:53:24,920
That's very possible to,
you know,

2638
01:53:24,921 --> 01:53:29,921
um,
maybe that even more so because of the 

2639
01:53:29,921 --> 01:53:32,381
controversy involving some of the fights
lately where guys haven't been exciting 

2640
01:53:32,381 --> 01:53:36,310
like the anderson silva fight where he 
kind of slacked off over the last two 

2641
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:38,270
rounds and people even criticizing jose 
aldo for his last round of his fight.

2642
01:53:38,510 --> 01:53:41,300
So If that's the case,
if they're affected by that stuff,

2643
01:53:41,350 --> 01:53:42,980
maybe they might come out and try to 
prove a point.

2644
01:53:43,220 --> 01:53:46,730
I don't think that's going to happen 
because to too much is at stake and both

2645
01:53:46,731 --> 01:53:51,731
guys are too dangerous.
They're both two of the most dangerous 

2646
01:53:51,731 --> 01:53:52,220
and explosive guys in that light 
heavyweight division.

2647
01:53:52,221 --> 01:53:57,221
And anything can happen.
So that's my prediction for the main 

2648
01:53:57,221 --> 01:53:57,221
event.

2649
01:53:57,221 --> 01:53:57,820
Karate guy,
his cheetah.

2650
01:53:57,940 --> 01:53:59,650
Cheetah.
do you think,

2651
01:53:59,651 --> 01:54:00,780
what do you think his karate as well?

2652
01:54:00,810 --> 01:54:02,640
Martial art in general.
Well,

2653
01:54:02,670 --> 01:54:07,670
what machIda does is very smart is he 
combined the good things of karate with 

2654
01:54:07,891 --> 01:54:10,380
more thai and jujitsu and wrestling and 
boxing,

2655
01:54:10,570 --> 01:54:15,570
you know,
but there's a lot of good stuff in 

2656
01:54:15,570 --> 01:54:15,570
karate.
The,

2657
01:54:15,570 --> 01:54:16,830
the ability to leap in and leave out 
like the way they fight.

2658
01:54:16,980 --> 01:54:21,980
They're very.
The footwork is different than like 

2659
01:54:21,980 --> 01:54:21,980
moitai guys,
more thai guys,

2660
01:54:21,980 --> 01:54:25,430
more like they learned that their light 
on their feet but they weighed in and 

2661
01:54:25,430 --> 01:54:25,440
they get real close to each other and 
attack,

2662
01:54:25,550 --> 01:54:30,550
you know,
and they check kicks and attacks the 

2663
01:54:30,550 --> 01:54:30,550
karate guys,
they're all,

2664
01:54:30,550 --> 01:54:30,550
it's almost like fencing,
like explode,

2665
01:54:30,590 --> 01:54:35,590
explode out.
And if you're not used to fighting 

2666
01:54:35,590 --> 01:54:35,590
machida he's super hard to deal with 
because that,

2667
01:54:35,590 --> 01:54:38,130
that explosion that is fucking throws 
you off many.

2668
01:54:38,140 --> 01:54:43,140
He leans way back and he dives in and 
he's super accurate with things and iF 

2669
01:54:43,140 --> 01:54:44,400
he catches you with one of those,
he could fuck you up.

2670
01:54:44,590 --> 01:54:47,010
it lightens you up like pot shot at you 
from a distance.

2671
01:54:47,011 --> 01:54:48,930
You're in trouble.
That's what happened to rashad evans.

2672
01:54:48,931 --> 01:54:52,320
He started just lighten them up.
He started like laying back and he comes

2673
01:54:52,321 --> 01:54:55,350
in and blast them and then once he does 
it a couple of times,

2674
01:54:55,351 --> 01:55:00,351
that's all he needs to do.
You don't even need to hit you a couple 

2675
01:55:00,351 --> 01:55:01,380
of times before.
You're like a little bewildered and he's

2676
01:55:01,381 --> 01:55:02,640
so good at that.
He did that too.

2677
01:55:02,641 --> 01:55:03,870
So could you.
You know,

2678
01:55:03,871 --> 01:55:08,871
he did that to tiago silva.
Stopped him at the end of the first 

2679
01:55:08,871 --> 01:55:08,871
round is a fucking killer,
man.

2680
01:55:08,871 --> 01:55:12,680
He's a killer and he's going to be 
trying to do that even more on shogun 

2681
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:13,650
den in their first fight.
He's going to be more fired up,

2682
01:55:13,680 --> 01:55:16,080
more motivated.
I think he's going to be even better.

2683
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:21,200
And then show gun.
He's got to be super confident because 

2684
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:23,541
he feels like you won that first fight.
He feels like he got robbed them 

2685
01:55:23,541 --> 01:55:25,971
decision.
So he's going to be confident and he's 

2686
01:55:25,971 --> 01:55:28,251
gonna be fucking coming in guns blazing 
and leo's going to be confident and the 

2687
01:55:28,251 --> 01:55:30,090
other is going to be more motivated,
better strategies going to be an awesome

2688
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:30,960
fucking fight.
Okay.

2689
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:37,920
Are you just,
you just go buy a karate studio and 

2690
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:37,920
you're just like,
okay.

2691
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:38,840
That little 15 year old has a black 
belt,

2692
01:55:39,230 --> 01:55:44,230
you know,
that's your sport that you can get a 15 

2693
01:55:44,230 --> 01:55:44,230
year old can be,
have a black belt.

2694
01:55:44,230 --> 01:55:44,230
Are you kIdding?
Well that's

2695
01:55:44,230 --> 01:55:45,970
the problem with the thing they call the
mcdo.

2696
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:50,320
Joe's joe's the muck jo jo syndrome is 
that,

2697
01:55:50,370 --> 01:55:55,370
you know,
when martial arts became popular in 

2698
01:55:55,370 --> 01:55:55,370
America,
I guess in the sixties or whatever,

2699
01:55:55,370 --> 01:55:57,550
when people started watching Bruce Lee 
movies in the seventies and shit,

2700
01:55:57,820 --> 01:56:02,820
what happened was people got really into
karate and karate became a business and 

2701
01:56:02,820 --> 01:56:04,240
they open up karate schools all over the
world,

2702
01:56:04,470 --> 01:56:09,470
you know,
and people wanted to learn how to kick 

2703
01:56:09,470 --> 01:56:11,821
people's asses and then it became like 
some bullshit mysticism thing and a lot 

2704
01:56:11,821 --> 01:56:12,970
of bowing.
And they're very cult like,

2705
01:56:12,971 --> 01:56:14,320
man,
if you never been to karate.

2706
01:56:14,321 --> 01:56:16,090
Schools are a lot of martial arts 
schools.

2707
01:56:16,091 --> 01:56:18,380
My taekwondo school is very cult like,
you know,

2708
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:19,150
they're like,
you know,

2709
01:56:19,151 --> 01:56:19,570
the,
the,

2710
01:56:19,720 --> 01:56:21,760
the,
the sensei can do no wrong.

2711
01:56:21,761 --> 01:56:22,750
And everything is.
Yes sir.

2712
01:56:22,751 --> 01:56:24,760
Yes sir.
It's like they're never a,

2713
01:56:24,761 --> 01:56:29,761
an even and equal with you,
which is one of the beautiful things 

2714
01:56:29,761 --> 01:56:29,761
about jujitsu.

2715
01:56:29,761 --> 01:56:31,690
Jujitsu is totally the opposite.
Your instructors just liKe you.

2716
01:56:31,720 --> 01:56:34,120
He's super cool and just like you,
you don't have to call them.

2717
01:56:34,290 --> 01:56:35,140
I mean,
if you do call him sir.

2718
01:56:35,141 --> 01:56:37,980
It's out of respect.
But he's gonna I approached her brother,

2719
01:56:37,990 --> 01:56:40,240
my friend to call me sir.
You Know john.

2720
01:56:40,241 --> 01:56:41,650
John would shadow would laugh if you 
call them.

2721
01:56:41,651 --> 01:56:43,840
Sorry.
He's just a friendly,

2722
01:56:43,841 --> 01:56:46,250
cool guy that knows something that you 
don't know.

2723
01:56:46,251 --> 01:56:47,920
He's going to show it to you.
So like jujitsu,

2724
01:56:47,990 --> 01:56:50,760
the,
it's way more rare for a 15 year old gay

2725
01:56:50,850 --> 01:56:55,850
black bell and it really,
really hard to get your black belt in 

2726
01:56:55,850 --> 01:56:55,850
jujitsu.
Martial arts,

2727
01:56:55,930 --> 01:56:57,750
they have much lower standards than 
jujitsu.

2728
01:56:57,790 --> 01:56:59,260
Most of them do.
And karate.

2729
01:56:59,261 --> 01:57:02,020
A lot of schools can.
If you go to a real karate school,

2730
01:57:02,021 --> 01:57:03,010
like a real,
you know,

2731
01:57:03,070 --> 01:57:08,070
okinawa and karate school or a cushion 
karate school where they're like really 

2732
01:57:08,070 --> 01:57:09,520
like rigid traditional,
old school.

2733
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:09,940
WaIt,
no,

2734
01:57:09,941 --> 01:57:12,310
they're not going to give you a fucking 
black belt if you're not ready.

2735
01:57:12,610 --> 01:57:14,680
You got to get that back,
but you gotta earn that shit.

2736
01:57:14,681 --> 01:57:17,020
You gotta want to masa yamas fucking 
schools.

2737
01:57:17,170 --> 01:57:20,160
One of his affiliates,
you know those guys that's.

2738
01:57:20,350 --> 01:57:22,520
Those are serious hard motherfuckers.
Those,

2739
01:57:22,521 --> 01:57:27,521
those karate tournament,
they fight in especially the kill 

2740
01:57:27,521 --> 01:57:27,521
cushion karate tournaments.
Those dudes are fucking animals.

2741
01:57:27,521 --> 01:57:30,190
They don't punch to the face,
but they kick to the face and kicked the

2742
01:57:30,191 --> 01:57:32,650
body and kick to the legs.
They're fucking tough,

2743
01:57:32,651 --> 01:57:33,190
man.
That's a.

2744
01:57:33,191 --> 01:57:34,660
That's a hard,
hard sport.

2745
01:57:34,780 --> 01:57:38,080
So our hard martial art,
if you go to those schools,

2746
01:57:38,110 --> 01:57:43,110
you're not going to be able to get a 
nine year old and get them their black 

2747
01:57:43,110 --> 01:57:43,110
belt.
But if you go to one of these,

2748
01:57:43,110 --> 01:57:47,881
like fred valori schools,
they used to be like the united studios 

2749
01:57:47,881 --> 01:57:50,761
of self defense when I lived in 
Massachusetts for fucking 12 years old 

2750
01:57:50,761 --> 01:57:51,400
and you got a black belt that's 
ridiculous and you can't crack an egg.

2751
01:57:51,610 --> 01:57:53,540
Like they don't have any idea how to 
fight.

2752
01:57:53,690 --> 01:57:55,720
They don't.
They're completely lost their,

2753
01:57:55,960 --> 01:58:00,310
they want to do like high kicks and 
catia and fucking knife and strike you.

2754
01:58:00,580 --> 01:58:02,530
Like they literally don't know how to 
fight.

2755
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:04,870
They like taught how to do this stupid 
dance,

2756
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:10,080
you know,
they don't even have contact when they 

2757
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:10,080
spar.
I can,

2758
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:10,080
most of the schools.

2759
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:13,250
Could you hear that?
The boy scouts now have a badge for 

2760
01:58:13,250 --> 01:58:14,600
playing video games.
I thought it was crazy because then that

2761
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:19,640
doesn't that defeat everything that boy 
scouts about like adventures outdoors 

2762
01:58:19,640 --> 01:58:23,451
and yeah,
they have a video game badge and like 

2763
01:58:23,451 --> 01:58:23,451
government man,
they want you to become a.

2764
01:58:23,451 --> 01:58:27,990
Or they want you to target their drones.
Could you hear obama made a joke about 

2765
01:58:27,990 --> 01:58:28,780
fucking drones?
How do you know the,

2766
01:58:28,781 --> 01:58:33,781
you know,
the whole thing with obama and he told 

2767
01:58:33,781 --> 01:58:33,781
jokes and jay leno told jokes.
Jay leno kind of bombed.

2768
01:58:33,781 --> 01:58:34,500
No,
I didn't hear about this.

2769
01:58:34,501 --> 01:58:35,990
The white house.
I think there's a white house.

2770
01:58:36,060 --> 01:58:37,890
White house press correspondents' 
dinner.

2771
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:39,100
I thinK that's what it's called.
Right?

2772
01:58:39,300 --> 01:58:41,440
You didn't hear about this.
Why I ignore all

2773
01:58:42,490 --> 01:58:44,500
you got to checK this out because it's 
fascinating.

2774
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:46,450
Obama goes on and,
and,

2775
01:58:46,570 --> 01:58:48,550
and everyone's like,
obama did so well.

2776
01:58:48,850 --> 01:58:53,850
Opie and anthony were the only ones that
said obama didn't do well and I fucking 

2777
01:58:53,850 --> 01:58:54,760
completely agree with them.
He just butchered the jokes,

2778
01:58:54,820 --> 01:58:58,060
like the timing sucked,
but the jokes were pretty well written.

2779
01:58:58,061 --> 01:59:03,061
I think some of the guys from the daily 
show or something running for him and 

2780
01:59:03,061 --> 01:59:04,300
um,
the jokes put his delivery is terrible.

2781
01:59:04,301 --> 01:59:06,040
It's all clunky and,
but he,

2782
01:59:06,041 --> 01:59:09,640
he got big laughs.
But one of the jokes he did and no one's

2783
01:59:09,641 --> 01:59:12,220
even talking about this,
one of the jokes he did,

2784
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:14,560
he said,
the jonas brothers are here.

2785
01:59:14,561 --> 01:59:16,270
Where are you?
Jonas brothers?

2786
01:59:16,330 --> 01:59:21,330
There you are.
And he said something about his 

2787
01:59:21,330 --> 01:59:21,330
daughters,
you know,

2788
01:59:21,330 --> 01:59:21,550
that his daughters,
uh,

2789
01:59:21,551 --> 01:59:23,890
you know,
his daughters are very beautiful,

2790
01:59:24,010 --> 01:59:26,530
but I want to let you know,
don't even think about it.

2791
01:59:26,531 --> 01:59:31,531
I've got two words for you.
It was like spy drone or soMething.

2792
01:59:32,791 --> 01:59:36,030
Drone.
What of those drones called by drones.

2793
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:37,860
But like you said,
I have two words for you.

2794
01:59:37,861 --> 01:59:40,560
I like unmanned drone.
Like what,

2795
01:59:40,680 --> 01:59:41,760
what,
what are you saying?

2796
01:59:41,761 --> 01:59:42,540
Mr.
President,

2797
01:59:42,541 --> 01:59:45,750
you're joking around that if one of 
these boys,

2798
01:59:45,751 --> 01:59:48,210
who by the way are like the most wishy 
washy,

2799
01:59:48,390 --> 01:59:48,840
chris

2800
01:59:49,910 --> 01:59:53,140
non-offensive non-dangerous,
they have fucking these white.

2801
01:59:53,330 --> 01:59:55,380
You're upset at how these bracelets on.
Yeah.

2802
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:59,340
Dude drawn away and fucking called it.
I think that's pretty funny.

2803
01:59:59,341 --> 02:00:04,341
It's not funny.
He's talking about things that kill 

2804
02:00:04,341 --> 02:00:06,411
innocent people every day.
I use that thing in Pakistan and those 

2805
02:00:06,411 --> 02:00:06,480
things,
they launched them in the,

2806
02:00:06,510 --> 02:00:06,810
in,
in,

2807
02:00:06,811 --> 02:00:11,811
into these villages and launched some of
these mountain sides and people get 

2808
02:00:11,811 --> 02:00:11,880
jacked left.
Yeah.

2809
02:00:11,881 --> 02:00:14,100
But you can also say that sorts of 
people that get killed.

2810
02:00:14,130 --> 02:00:16,200
You could say that about jokIng about 
anything.

2811
02:00:16,230 --> 02:00:17,940
airplanes,
anything.

2812
02:00:17,941 --> 02:00:18,910
You know,
I mean there's a.

2813
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:24,000
You can joke about black helicopters,
but black helicopters kill people for 

2814
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:24,000
the government.
Patchy helicopters,

2815
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:24,930
you know,
I mean drones.

2816
02:00:24,931 --> 02:00:29,931
That's pretty funny.
He says taking something that's like 

2817
02:00:29,931 --> 02:00:29,931
kind of in the news,

2818
02:00:29,931 --> 02:00:30,150
your example is ridiculous.
And,

2819
02:00:30,151 --> 02:00:31,220
and here's,
here's the thing,

2820
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:33,630
when you're the president of the god 
damn United States,

2821
02:00:33,631 --> 02:00:36,290
it's just like when George Bush waS 
president and he said,

2822
02:00:36,291 --> 02:00:37,730
where are the weapons of mass 
destruction?

2823
02:00:37,820 --> 02:00:38,810
None under here.

2824
02:00:39,480 --> 02:00:40,960
Right?
It's like looking under his desk.

2825
02:00:41,010 --> 02:00:46,010
Yeah.
But drones aren't just made for 

2826
02:00:46,010 --> 02:00:46,010
killings,
for spying and stuff,

2827
02:00:46,010 --> 02:00:46,010
you know,
they have hellfire missiles on them.

2828
02:00:46,010 --> 02:00:48,100
They're there to find people that are 
bad and lost,

2829
02:00:48,470 --> 02:00:51,080
but there's also implying he's going to 
spy on the jonas brothers.

2830
02:00:52,070 --> 02:00:53,600
He's going to kill them.
Right with,

2831
02:00:53,790 --> 02:00:57,310
with something that they've been killing
people with light lighthearted.

2832
02:00:57,311 --> 02:01:02,311
It's not like that's.
I think that's attacking somebody that 

2833
02:01:02,311 --> 02:01:03,010
you want to attack the person.
I think that's ridiculous.

2834
02:01:03,011 --> 02:01:06,070
If you're getting angry about that.
You think that me saying that,

2835
02:01:06,071 --> 02:01:07,740
him saying that is attacking him.
No,

2836
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:12,840
no.
You're obviously taking it like in 

2837
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:12,840
America,
right?

2838
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:12,840
I can't believe he's joking about this 
shit.

2839
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:12,840
Go man,
brian,

2840
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:17,761
when you're the president of a country 
that is literally fucking the whole 

2841
02:01:17,761 --> 02:01:17,761
world.
I don't see that

2842
02:01:17,761 --> 02:01:22,390
evolve into wars overseas and these 
weird things that happened in Pakistan 

2843
02:01:22,390 --> 02:01:27,311
that are,
I don't know who approves them or how 

2844
02:01:27,311 --> 02:01:28,790
exactly they work where they have these 
drones that fire these missiles at these

2845
02:01:28,791 --> 02:01:31,970
people that we don't like and all sorts 
of other people die,

2846
02:01:32,210 --> 02:01:34,790
but that's not something I would joke 
about if I was the president,

2847
02:01:35,530 --> 02:01:39,140
but there's plenty of shit to make you 
think that he's joking.

2848
02:01:39,260 --> 02:01:40,250
Also kInd of acting

2849
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:43,700
like my mom getting mad about him.
I can't believe he said a joke.

2850
02:01:43,701 --> 02:01:48,701
It's a dumb joke.
I don't know why he would think it's 

2851
02:01:48,701 --> 02:01:50,771
funny.
I don't know why he would think killing 

2852
02:01:50,771 --> 02:01:50,771
boys that want to fuck his guy thing.
It's fucking hilarious.

2853
02:01:50,771 --> 02:01:53,380
It say that to the jonas brothers.
I would say that hilarious.

2854
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:58,920
It wasn't a good job.
It was like you've got the worst 

2855
02:01:58,920 --> 02:01:58,920
response of any of his bits.
It wasn't well delivered either.

2856
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:01,520
I think it's brilliant.
I can't believe you think that because I

2857
02:02:01,521 --> 02:02:04,640
think I wouldn't say that if I was the 
president that's retarded,

2858
02:02:04,670 --> 02:02:09,670
which is saying something really.
You don't think there's any comment and 

2859
02:02:09,670 --> 02:02:10,910
that there's something very serious 
about being a person who's responsible,

2860
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:16,120
at least indirectly for many,
many people dying because of these 

2861
02:02:16,120 --> 02:02:16,130
fucking drones.
Many people crying.

2862
02:02:16,250 --> 02:02:19,250
Many families devastated.
Many people lost theIr children.

2863
02:02:19,370 --> 02:02:21,800
Many people lost their loved ones gone 
forever,

2864
02:02:21,890 --> 02:02:24,380
but because it's taking place in 
Pakistan doesn't freak you out.

2865
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:28,520
what did we use involved In drone 
attacks in Ohio would have kids you went

2866
02:02:28,521 --> 02:02:33,521
to high school with got fucking killed.
They got their legs blown off because 

2867
02:02:33,521 --> 02:02:35,240
obama is using drones to target al qaeda
in Ohio.

2868
02:02:35,540 --> 02:02:37,010
Wouldn't that wouldn't?
You're saying,

2869
02:02:37,011 --> 02:02:38,040
well,
what if though joe,

2870
02:02:38,050 --> 02:02:39,110
you're saying,
what if not,

2871
02:02:39,111 --> 02:02:40,530
what really happened?
He just brought it.

2872
02:02:41,300 --> 02:02:46,300
I see what you're saying.
No different than Ohio for you to think 

2873
02:02:46,300 --> 02:02:49,901
that it's okay and Pakistan and not okay
in Ohio because I didn't say it because 

2874
02:02:49,901 --> 02:02:49,940
it's.
That makes it a what if joe,

2875
02:02:49,941 --> 02:02:51,590
you're making.
You're making it seem like that.

2876
02:02:51,591 --> 02:02:54,320
I.
I'm that sensitive about the middle east

2877
02:02:54,321 --> 02:02:56,870
and stuff where I'm not.
I don't think about that shit.

2878
02:02:57,050 --> 02:03:02,050
You know,
you're getting really sensitive about 

2879
02:03:02,050 --> 02:03:02,050
our war and our troops and everything.

2880
02:03:02,050 --> 02:03:02,050
Oh,
I'm not thinking like,

2881
02:03:02,050 --> 02:03:03,650
oh,
I just made a joke about murder.

2882
02:03:03,660 --> 02:03:05,840
Yeah,
I figure you're getting really sensitive

2883
02:03:05,841 --> 02:03:07,900
about obama just doing a bad job.
You know?

2884
02:03:08,300 --> 02:03:11,030
That's just a bad joke.
It's a ridiculous,

2885
02:03:11,031 --> 02:03:16,031
irresponsible joke.
I think to make a joke like that in the 

2886
02:03:16,031 --> 02:03:19,600
middle of two wars that people don't 
approve and all these things that are 

2887
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:20,780
happening in Pakistan with unmanned 
drones,

2888
02:03:20,781 --> 02:03:22,580
I don't think you should be making jokes
like that.

2889
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:27,680
It less.
They're fucking hilarious and that show 

2890
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:27,680
was lame as fuck.
I think it's.

2891
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:29,660
I think it's pretty funny for it when,
especially when the president says,

2892
02:03:29,661 --> 02:03:34,661
I think it's hilarious.
I think it makes our president seem 

2893
02:03:34,661 --> 02:03:37,060
edgy.
I think it seems like he's not playing 

2894
02:03:37,060 --> 02:03:38,780
dumb and trying to butter like nerf are 
fucking ears.

2895
02:03:38,781 --> 02:03:40,040
He's actually saying something that's 
like,

2896
02:03:40,041 --> 02:03:41,330
wow,
that's kind of blue.

2897
02:03:41,460 --> 02:03:42,860
That's kinda crazy.
Dude.

2898
02:03:42,920 --> 02:03:45,650
Military the president does now the key 
to the drums.

2899
02:03:46,100 --> 02:03:47,690
Oh,
so his joke is not only,

2900
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:52,720
it's not correct as well,
you don't think they would let hIm 

2901
02:03:52,720 --> 02:03:52,720
borrow the key so he could kill the 
jonas brothers?

2902
02:03:52,720 --> 02:03:57,340
Is that what you're trying to say?
Thank you very much for trying to 

2903
02:03:57,340 --> 02:03:57,340
answer.
Yeah,

2904
02:03:57,340 --> 02:03:57,340
but you're saying like you're,
you know your,

2905
02:03:57,340 --> 02:03:58,970
like your joke on baby blowjobs,
you're saying like,

2906
02:03:58,971 --> 02:04:00,060
you know,
that's bad to say,

2907
02:04:00,070 --> 02:04:05,070
you know,
how many people are child molesters and 

2908
02:04:05,070 --> 02:04:05,070
stuff.
If I wasn't,

2909
02:04:05,070 --> 02:04:05,070
no.
Here's an example that you need to use.

2910
02:04:05,070 --> 02:04:09,550
If I was a child molester and I was out 
there below and babies and then I did a 

2911
02:04:09,550 --> 02:04:13,571
joke about baby blow jobs than it will 
be the same as what the president is 

2912
02:04:13,571 --> 02:04:17,741
doing.
So the president is killing people with 

2913
02:04:17,741 --> 02:04:18,200
drones right now while the president is 
the spokesperson for the country and the

2914
02:04:18,201 --> 02:04:23,201
country is in fact at war and has 
military that is killing people with 

2915
02:04:23,201 --> 02:04:23,730
drones.
I just,

2916
02:04:24,290 --> 02:04:25,560
I see it as at the top of the food 
chain.

2917
02:04:25,580 --> 02:04:27,080
I see why.
I see why you're upset,

2918
02:04:27,081 --> 02:04:28,430
but I just,
I just don't see it.

2919
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:30,860
I just didn't see it.
I understand that you don't see it,

2920
02:04:30,861 --> 02:04:33,240
but I think it's hilarious.
Understand.

2921
02:04:33,560 --> 02:04:36,230
Here's the open.
Anthony were mad too about this.

2922
02:04:36,660 --> 02:04:38,430
Um,
no,

2923
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:39,930
I think they were talking about 
something else.

2924
02:04:40,250 --> 02:04:43,080
we're talking about his jokes bombing.
they would just send me that they were,

2925
02:04:43,550 --> 02:04:44,930
you know,
they were open.

2926
02:04:44,970 --> 02:04:48,180
Anthony were set at his delivery.
His delivery was Tyler Norton.

2927
02:04:48,181 --> 02:04:51,630
Norton was going crazy.
It was run on norton,

2928
02:04:51,631 --> 02:04:54,330
but he's also loves jay leno,
you know,

2929
02:04:55,180 --> 02:04:57,150
and he was honest in his assessment of 
jay leno.

2930
02:04:57,151 --> 02:05:00,000
Jay was like rushing through it.
He was lIke rushing through his joke,

2931
02:05:00,030 --> 02:05:05,030
but the jokes were lame.
He knew he had bad jokes and I think he 

2932
02:05:05,030 --> 02:05:05,640
thought it was going to be an easy crowd
and he could just squeak by,

2933
02:05:05,790 --> 02:05:06,590
you know.
But,

2934
02:05:06,630 --> 02:05:11,630
but I think he realized when he got 
there that there was some pressure on 

2935
02:05:11,630 --> 02:05:14,571
him.
I think a lot of people don't like him 

2936
02:05:14,571 --> 02:05:14,571
now they're poor.
Fuck,

2937
02:05:14,571 --> 02:05:14,571
you know,
everybody's all mad at jake [inaudible].

2938
02:05:14,571 --> 02:05:16,890
He took his job back.
Like why does everybody give a shit?

2939
02:05:17,100 --> 02:05:22,100
you know,
conan o'brian gets 35 fucking million 

2940
02:05:22,100 --> 02:05:22,100
dollars and it gets to go to tbs,
whatever.

2941
02:05:22,100 --> 02:05:23,830
That's funny how he straight up lied 
though on the,

2942
02:05:23,890 --> 02:05:28,890
on the um,
what are 60 minutes the other day about 

2943
02:05:28,890 --> 02:05:29,220
twice,
twice.

2944
02:05:29,221 --> 02:05:32,110
And he said that the reason why he got 
fired,

2945
02:05:32,111 --> 02:05:37,111
not lenovo,
because his payout or leno's payout was 

2946
02:05:37,111 --> 02:05:37,390
more or something like that.
But they are like,

2947
02:05:37,391 --> 02:05:38,440
nbc is like,
that's a lie.

2948
02:05:38,710 --> 02:05:41,890
Their payouts were exactly the same.
They also said something like,

2949
02:05:41,950 --> 02:05:42,990
uh,
maybe he didn't know.

2950
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:44,290
Maybe it was just mistaken.
Well,

2951
02:05:44,310 --> 02:05:49,310
he didn't.
There was another thing somebody told 

2952
02:05:49,310 --> 02:05:49,310
that by agents or something to something
about nbc losing money.

2953
02:05:49,310 --> 02:05:52,300
But what I find odd though is that I 
checked ratings the other day.

2954
02:05:52,301 --> 02:05:57,301
Jay leno's ratings and conan's ratings 
are almost exactly the same as they 

2955
02:05:57,301 --> 02:05:59,110
were.
If you were going from year to year from

2956
02:05:59,111 --> 02:06:01,600
last year to this year or whatever.
Exactly the same.

2957
02:06:01,601 --> 02:06:04,990
So there's no money.
There's no like leno's number one makinG

2958
02:06:04,991 --> 02:06:07,030
$50,
million dollars extra month.

2959
02:06:07,090 --> 02:06:09,130
It's been.
He was saying he was,

2960
02:06:09,131 --> 02:06:10,200
but maybe before.
Yeah,

2961
02:06:10,380 --> 02:06:15,380
for what they're thinking,
that he's eventually going to bring it 

2962
02:06:15,380 --> 02:06:16,170
back to where he was beFore that he's 
gonna take over the reins and,

2963
02:06:16,171 --> 02:06:21,171
you know,
have it back to where it waS because 

2964
02:06:21,171 --> 02:06:21,171
when he left he was number one.
Yeah.

2965
02:06:21,171 --> 02:06:21,850
I don't know man.
The whole thing is this,

2966
02:06:21,870 --> 02:06:23,730
a stupid argument is like,
who cares?

2967
02:06:23,731 --> 02:06:25,170
it's just entertainment and not only 
that,

2968
02:06:25,171 --> 02:06:27,420
it's not the best entertainment.
If kony had a talk,

2969
02:06:27,480 --> 02:06:29,630
not a talk show rather,
but like a,

2970
02:06:29,631 --> 02:06:30,960
um,
a sketch show,

2971
02:06:31,050 --> 02:06:36,050
I think that would rule.
That's what I would like to say because 

2972
02:06:36,050 --> 02:06:36,630
I think conan's the best parts on conan.
It was when he does those sketches,

2973
02:06:36,810 --> 02:06:37,610
like when he did those,
uh,

2974
02:06:37,611 --> 02:06:40,440
the baseball player,
the 18 hundreds baseball players when he

2975
02:06:40,441 --> 02:06:45,441
went there and played baseball with them
and he was talking 1800 speak fucking 

2976
02:06:45,441 --> 02:06:48,801
hilarious.
That was way better to me than his 

2977
02:06:48,801 --> 02:06:48,801
interviews.
And these interviews are cool,

2978
02:06:48,801 --> 02:06:49,200
but most of the people that he's talking
to,

2979
02:06:49,201 --> 02:06:50,250
it's like,
what are they doing?

2980
02:06:50,251 --> 02:06:53,040
They're just selling some shit.
I jusT want you to see their movie.

2981
02:06:53,041 --> 02:06:56,430
They just want you to buy their book or 
wants you to listen to their music.

2982
02:06:56,431 --> 02:06:57,450
It's like,
you know,

2983
02:06:57,451 --> 02:06:59,610
it's like he's just helping themselves.
Shit.

2984
02:06:59,660 --> 02:07:02,900
That's really all it is.
So bad in general of how bad,

2985
02:07:02,901 --> 02:07:05,020
like a jimmy fallon,
they have a whole.

2986
02:07:05,060 --> 02:07:10,060
They had a whole like 10 minutes sketch 
the other day on subway and it was a 

2987
02:07:10,060 --> 02:07:14,021
commercial and it was like people were,
there was actors involved and they were 

2988
02:07:14,021 --> 02:07:15,710
like doing skits all about subway.
Oh,

2989
02:07:15,711 --> 02:07:17,530
subway subs.
Subs like $5.

2990
02:07:17,531 --> 02:07:22,531
Footlongs was the whole thing they're 
talking to and it was an ad for like 10 

2991
02:07:22,531 --> 02:07:22,531
minutes.

2992
02:07:22,531 --> 02:07:23,800
So.
Oh well,

2993
02:07:23,860 --> 02:07:24,730
you know,
if it was funny,

2994
02:07:24,731 --> 02:07:26,170
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't have a problem with it.

2995
02:07:26,650 --> 02:07:27,990
You know,
especially for the flashlight,

2996
02:07:28,130 --> 02:07:30,640
one commercial where they rip off Brian 
Collins act.

2997
02:07:31,270 --> 02:07:36,270
There's a commercial,
like an old spice commercial where this 

2998
02:07:36,270 --> 02:07:36,270
guy's like doing.
Look at my stance

2999
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:39,020
on the horse and the horse.
I have an apple tv.

3000
02:07:39,110 --> 02:07:41,250
That is brian calories serious.
Fuck.

3001
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:44,070
That's like one of the most popular 
commercials I do like super rich.

3002
02:07:44,080 --> 02:07:48,610
Now That guy sounds like brian couns act
and all these people are saying that,

3003
02:07:48,730 --> 02:07:51,010
and apparently advertising executives do
that all the time.

3004
02:07:51,190 --> 02:07:56,190
They see comics,
they go to comedy clubs and get an idea 

3005
02:07:56,190 --> 02:07:56,190
from their ag.
Here's something,

3006
02:07:56,190 --> 02:07:58,720
here's something weird.
There was a movie called miss march.

3007
02:07:58,750 --> 02:08:00,610
It was a,
I forget the pli.

3008
02:08:00,640 --> 02:08:03,770
I was half drunk watching this movie and
uh,

3009
02:08:04,030 --> 02:08:06,840
the chat or it's the craig robinson,
is that his name?

3010
02:08:07,120 --> 02:08:12,120
He played a character in this movie 
called horse cock dot mpeg.

3011
02:08:13,120 --> 02:08:16,110
And the whole time I'm watching it,
it's like they call listens character.

3012
02:08:16,130 --> 02:08:16,960
Yeah.
And that whole thing,

3013
02:08:16,961 --> 02:08:18,550
they'll joke was his,
that his character.

3014
02:08:18,551 --> 02:08:21,050
He's a rapper named horse cock dot j 
mpeg.

3015
02:08:21,220 --> 02:08:26,220
And the whole time I'm thinking like,
that's kind of weird because of your 

3016
02:08:26,220 --> 02:08:28,450
horse bit material about being a mr 
han's dot mpeg.

3017
02:08:28,860 --> 02:08:29,950
No,
that's weird.

3018
02:08:30,130 --> 02:08:35,130
But it's weird that like,
how there's so much similar things like 

3019
02:08:35,130 --> 02:08:35,130
that.
And I'm wondering like,

3020
02:08:35,130 --> 02:08:38,431
you know,
writers and people in marketing and 

3021
02:08:38,431 --> 02:08:38,431
commercial and stuff,
if they really just,

3022
02:08:38,431 --> 02:08:43,050
you know,
that's a real connection and anybody 

3023
02:08:43,050 --> 02:08:43,050
could come over really hotdog mpeg.
Look,

3024
02:08:43,050 --> 02:08:43,880
it was a real video Man.
yeah,

3025
02:08:44,040 --> 02:08:49,040
but only you of all people focused in on
a point that was called mr [inaudible] 

3026
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:49,040
dot [inaudible].

3027
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:49,300
No,
I don't.

3028
02:08:49,301 --> 02:08:50,950
I think that's silly.
I'd absolutely.

3029
02:08:50,951 --> 02:08:52,940
That's what it's called.
You can't.

3030
02:08:53,070 --> 02:08:58,070
I mean,
just because I've talked about it on 

3031
02:08:58,070 --> 02:08:58,070
stage.
I mean that's what.

3032
02:08:58,070 --> 02:08:58,070
That is what it is.
You can't say that somebody stole

3033
02:08:58,070 --> 02:08:58,900
that.
I didn't say it.

3034
02:08:58,901 --> 02:09:01,270
I just think it's weird that there's so 
many similar things.

3035
02:09:01,271 --> 02:09:01,850
Like you're saying,
right?

3036
02:09:01,870 --> 02:09:04,680
Brain talents that's stealing.
I know they stole it.

3037
02:09:04,770 --> 02:09:05,080
You know,
the,

3038
02:09:05,180 --> 02:09:10,180
all these comics have recognized that,
that it's like the guy's like doing a 

3039
02:09:10,180 --> 02:09:10,250
version of brian callen,
you know,

3040
02:09:10,251 --> 02:09:10,880
and probably,
you know,

3041
02:09:10,881 --> 02:09:15,881
he doesn't even know probably.
he's probably just some actor and he's 

3042
02:09:15,881 --> 02:09:15,881
funny and he just has the same voice.
No,

3043
02:09:15,881 --> 02:09:16,790
it's not the voice.
It's the,

3044
02:09:16,810 --> 02:09:17,380
the,
the,

3045
02:09:17,400 --> 02:09:22,400
the way brian talks about things.
He exaggerates like sometimes I just 

3046
02:09:22,400 --> 02:09:23,030
take a horse stance.
I just stand there.

3047
02:09:23,050 --> 02:09:26,690
He's got a ridiculous act like look up,
look up my body toned and defined.

3048
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:27,770
I'm eating a peach,
sometimes,

3049
02:09:27,771 --> 02:09:32,771
like to eat a peach.
This guy's like doing callan callan has 

3050
02:09:32,771 --> 02:09:33,070
this ridiculous character.
It's like someone doing that.

3051
02:09:33,080 --> 02:09:36,230
You might be a redneck character like 
going up and doing jeff foxworthy,

3052
02:09:36,231 --> 02:09:37,950
even if he's not calling himself.
Jeff fox were like,

3053
02:09:38,120 --> 02:09:43,120
you know where he got that came from.
But jeff foxworthy famous was Brian 

3054
02:09:43,120 --> 02:09:43,120
Collins,
not famous.

3055
02:09:43,120 --> 02:09:45,710
like if brian cowen was super famous and
then this commercial was out,

3056
02:09:45,711 --> 02:09:48,280
everybody would be like,
this guy's ripping off brian cowen,

3057
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:49,040
you know,
I was like,

3058
02:09:49,041 --> 02:09:51,310
he's doing brian cowen.
I think that shit's real common.

3059
02:09:51,320 --> 02:09:52,860
I think they do it all the time.
Cell dies.

3060
02:09:53,230 --> 02:09:55,040
Hmm.
I don't know about that.

3061
02:09:55,370 --> 02:09:56,750
Sam.
Tripoli seems to think so.

3062
02:09:57,110 --> 02:09:59,260
Sam shirt play things.
A lot of things that aren't true.

3063
02:09:59,390 --> 02:10:00,140
Really?
Like what?

3064
02:10:01,310 --> 02:10:03,220
Oh,
it's

3065
02:10:03,440 --> 02:10:07,010
two hours and two minutes.
That's just about it.

3066
02:10:07,220 --> 02:10:12,220
So next week we're going to fuck.
We're going to this week we're going to 

3067
02:10:12,220 --> 02:10:12,220
fuck one a's,
right?

3068
02:10:12,220 --> 02:10:12,220
We're going to talk.

3069
02:10:12,220 --> 02:10:13,040
Nah,
you know what my manager,

3070
02:10:13,100 --> 02:10:18,100
I'm sure,
but not want me to fuck one of those 

3071
02:10:18,100 --> 02:10:18,100
things.
Especially this one whole wine bottle.

3072
02:10:18,500 --> 02:10:19,270
Well,
you're already seeing it.

3073
02:10:19,280 --> 02:10:22,310
The shit out of that one.
UM,

3074
02:10:22,760 --> 02:10:23,450
so,
um,

3075
02:10:23,510 --> 02:10:28,510
I think the,
I mean definitely send me some twitter 

3076
02:10:28,510 --> 02:10:29,900
messages if you think that it's 
ridiculous to,

3077
02:10:29,901 --> 02:10:31,280
uh,
you know,

3078
02:10:31,520 --> 02:10:34,050
to think that I should not accept a 
because somehow

3079
02:10:34,110 --> 02:10:35,960
this is going to hurt my career.
I think it's ridiculous.

3080
02:10:36,230 --> 02:10:38,810
But I would like to hear your thoughts.
Am I allowed to accept it?

3081
02:10:39,440 --> 02:10:39,930
Yeah,
you can.

3082
02:10:39,980 --> 02:10:41,300
We can split the screen down in the 
middle.

3083
02:10:43,870 --> 02:10:48,680
This is brian's part of this show is 
sponsored by fleshlight.

3084
02:10:48,681 --> 02:10:52,640
My side is not hearsay shuchita banana 
long and I want to let cbs,

3085
02:10:52,641 --> 02:10:57,641
nbc,
and abc know that I'm ready and willing 

3086
02:10:57,641 --> 02:11:00,821
to do your family game show chiquita 
banana on this side flesh.

3087
02:11:01,510 --> 02:11:02,270
So,
uh,

3088
02:11:02,380 --> 02:11:04,070
I'm doing,
what do we need back here?

3089
02:11:04,071 --> 02:11:06,340
Do we need a monitor or do we need a 
green screen?

3090
02:11:06,360 --> 02:11:09,200
That's the other question is should it 
be a monitor or green?

3091
02:11:09,201 --> 02:11:13,600
Sixty inch led 3d dlp,
dlm.

3092
02:11:13,601 --> 02:11:15,980
No.
Lcd samsung.

3093
02:11:16,050 --> 02:11:21,050
that when you have people at home would 
have to watch with goggles on and we 

3094
02:11:21,050 --> 02:11:21,050
will be blurry and everything else you'd
be in three days.

3095
02:11:21,050 --> 02:11:21,290
Awesome.
no,

3096
02:11:21,310 --> 02:11:23,640
that's ridiculous.
Probably wouldn't even work.

3097
02:11:23,641 --> 02:11:25,530
I probably wouldn't transmit through 
this little shitty ustream.

3098
02:11:25,590 --> 02:11:26,370
What if it did

3099
02:11:28,650 --> 02:11:30,640
fuck's wrong?
So,

3100
02:11:30,670 --> 02:11:32,030
uh,
there's a question too.

3101
02:11:32,060 --> 02:11:34,460
Should we do a green screen?
I say yes.

3102
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:35,750
I'm looking at it right now.
I'm like,

3103
02:11:35,751 --> 02:11:37,970
it would be dope if we have an image of 
Space behind us.

3104
02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:39,320
That's the move,
right?

3105
02:11:39,330 --> 02:11:44,330
You have to do that.
Apparently we can't do that with this 

3106
02:11:44,330 --> 02:11:45,140
stream producer though when I'm worried 
about,

3107
02:11:45,141 --> 02:11:46,360
is that the,
the uh,

3108
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:48,650
ustream producers,
the only way we can get this thing up on

3109
02:11:48,651 --> 02:11:53,651
itunes or we're just using the eastern 
producer to take the signal out to the 

3110
02:11:53,651 --> 02:11:58,121
internet.
So we'll plug this into your computer 

3111
02:11:58,121 --> 02:11:58,121
and it'll be an input on eastern 
producer.

3112
02:11:58,121 --> 02:11:59,210
So we'll still be able to use.
You should produce or.

3113
02:11:59,220 --> 02:11:59,900
Yeah,
you should.

3114
02:11:59,901 --> 02:12:04,901
You know how this thing works for sure.
I can try castor figured out in five 

3115
02:12:04,901 --> 02:12:05,810
minutes.
That's how easy it was.

3116
02:12:05,850 --> 02:12:10,850
God damn genius.
Without him we would be doing the same 

3117
02:12:10,850 --> 02:12:15,021
thing,
but it would suck more and probably the 

3118
02:12:15,021 --> 02:12:15,021
sound would be going on in the 
background.

3119
02:12:15,021 --> 02:12:15,021
All right.
Green screen.

3120
02:12:15,021 --> 02:12:19,581
Most people think so.
I think that's what we're going to go 

3121
02:12:19,581 --> 02:12:19,581
with.
Let's unanimous.

3122
02:12:19,581 --> 02:12:19,581
Thank you.
Everybody.

3123
02:12:19,581 --> 02:12:19,581
Like,
yeah,

3124
02:12:19,581 --> 02:12:20,730
it's all green screen and everybody's 
saying greenspan,

3125
02:12:20,760 --> 02:12:23,070
they don't want to monitor monitor as a 
gay greenscreen is cool,

3126
02:12:23,071 --> 02:12:24,160
right?
Yeah.

3127
02:12:24,170 --> 02:12:25,410
All right.
So that's what we're gonna do.

3128
02:12:25,470 --> 02:12:28,920
That is the next stage.
So we have this and check this shit out.

3129
02:12:28,921 --> 02:12:30,990
Look how this thing does at the end of 
the show.

3130
02:12:31,200 --> 02:12:36,200
I go like that and it goes down fucking 
crazy,

3131
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,750
man.
I got that shIt at z gallerie yo.

3132
02:12:40,020 --> 02:12:40,750
So,
uh,

3133
02:12:41,100 --> 02:12:42,510
that's our show.
Ladies and gentlemen,

3134
02:12:42,750 --> 02:12:45,630
we will see you next week.
Tuesday as always.

3135
02:12:45,690 --> 02:12:50,690
You know,
how we rock it basically the same every 

3136
02:12:50,690 --> 02:12:50,690
week.

3137
02:12:50,690 --> 02:12:54,080
And um,
hiS thing is slowly but surely getting 

3138
02:12:54,080 --> 02:12:56,280
more and more,
more and more complicated,

3139
02:12:56,281 --> 02:12:58,350
but more professional,
smoother.

3140
02:12:58,410 --> 02:13:02,220
The sound for the itunes version is 
going to be way,

3141
02:13:02,221 --> 02:13:03,780
way,
way better now,

3142
02:13:03,980 --> 02:13:08,980
um,
with these professional microphones and 

3143
02:13:08,980 --> 02:13:08,980
the high end mp three player and all 
that jazz.

3144
02:13:08,980 --> 02:13:10,830
Um,
the video should be better now as well.

3145
02:13:10,920 --> 02:13:11,630
And,
uh,

3146
02:13:11,700 --> 02:13:12,720
eventually,
like I said,

3147
02:13:12,721 --> 02:13:15,430
we're going to have that and next week 
we're also going to have hd camera.

3148
02:13:15,431 --> 02:13:19,350
So we'll have two cameras to choose from
so we can switch back and forth,

3149
02:13:19,420 --> 02:13:21,650
just get crazy.
And uh,

3150
02:13:21,720 --> 02:13:23,730
eventually we're gonna have this thing 
set up like a real studio.

3151
02:13:23,731 --> 02:13:28,731
There's another,
there's another couch chaIr over here 

3152
02:13:28,731 --> 02:13:30,960
and we'll have it lit up better to just 
right now it's kind of funky.

3153
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:32,070
Um,
so,

3154
02:13:32,071 --> 02:13:34,260
uh,
it rolls on.

3155
02:13:34,410 --> 02:13:36,480
Thank you very much for 200 and I'm glad
you guys enjoyed it.

3156
02:13:36,540 --> 02:13:41,540
Fleshlight fleshlight.com
is where you can go if you want to fuck 

3157
02:13:41,540 --> 02:13:43,110
a rubber pussy and uh,
that's it.

3158
02:13:43,170 --> 02:13:44,580
So we'll see you next week.
Take care.
