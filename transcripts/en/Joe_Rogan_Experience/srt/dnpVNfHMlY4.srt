1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960
Here we go,
baby,

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,520
five,
four,

3
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:03,570
three,
two,

4
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,090
one,
boom,

5
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,700
and that can be only one thing.
Avant.

6
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,350
Well far as we know,
far as I know in the universe.

7
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,460
Do you know what they think?
What do you know that the concept of

8
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:17,820
infinity apparently as explained to me,
but people far smarter than us,

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,240
is that the universe is so big that not
only is there intelligent life out there

10
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:27,930
for sure,
but there's humans out there for sure

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,710
and infinity is so big that that means
somewhere in the universe there is

12
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:40,530
another Theo Vaughn that has done
exactly the same things that you've

13
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:43,140
done,
said exactly the same things that you've

14
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:45,630
said,
been in the same conversations that

15
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:50,370
you've been in,
down to that pause down to the

16
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:53,850
millisecond,
an infinite number of times,

17
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,170
and you believe it.
Yes.

18
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,660
Not just one,
not just one time,

19
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,130
but an unending number of times because
that's how big infinity is.

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,370
You're not buying it.
I'll bet infinity smaller than the.

21
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,610
If I had a bet.
Yeah,

22
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,350
I just don't think that that could for
me,

23
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:12,930
that couldn't for me if I.
If I knew that that was true,

24
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:14,490
that would just break my heart,
I feel like,

25
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,920
because then you would feel like
everything you're doing feels pointless,

26
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:18,720
you know,
but isn't it anyway?

27
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,770
Just what you know about the universe.
Let's just say the universe was limited

28
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:24,520
to the size of this galaxy.
Okay.

29
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,520
Right.
Which it really could be.

30
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,391
Could be.
I mean,

31
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:28,830
would you and I,
let's be honest,

32
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:30,010
we're kind of dumb,
right?

33
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:30,600
Right.
We're failing.

34
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,760
Oh yeah.
I'm just guessing.

35
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,180
Guess total guess.
I mean,

36
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,800
I'll,
I'll say some big words every now and

37
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:36,840
then,
but the reality is I learned those big

38
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:39,450
words from people that actually
understand them and I'm just repeating

39
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:42,940
the noises that they say
so.

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,100
So tomorrow I'm the last person that
thinks I'm smart.

41
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,851
Trust me.
Yeah.

42
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:48,810
We're all mimics.
Really.

43
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,970
Exactly.
So if you look at,

44
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,500
I think they think there are hundreds of
billions of stars in this galaxy.

45
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,940
Just that alone is too big.
Too Big,

46
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,590
too big for you to wrap your head
around.

47
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,290
It's too big.
There's no one.

48
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,130
When you think about like how big that
is,

49
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:06,690
like there's no way you really think
about it,

50
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,890
you just,
you just kind of like,

51
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:08,724
oh yeah,
yeah,

52
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:13,730
big now,
now think of infinite and so hundreds of

53
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,430
billions of those,
and then they think it's possible that

54
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:22,431
inside each galaxy they know that the
center of each galaxy has a supermassive

55
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,820
black hole in it and they think that
inside that supermassive black hole

56
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:30,690
might be a whole nother universe filled
with galaxies.

57
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,300
Each of them that have supermassive
black holes in the center.

58
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,340
You go through one of those nother
universe,

59
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,910
infinite universes,
so infinite infinities.

60
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,080
So the universe is infinite and there's
infinite numbers of universes.

61
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,180
So somewhere out there there's another
theo on same haircut,

62
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,970
same jokes,
same style.

63
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,930
Really?
Yup.

64
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,350
Same back problem killing.
It did a scary.

65
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:57,440
I feel like if that's true,
that makes the job.

66
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,250
I took this one.
It seems so much shorter.

67
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,010
If the.

68
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,740
If the universe is that much bigger,
I don't think it could be that big.

69
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,180
Look at this.
What did he show me?

70
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:06,970
Your Jamie.
What is that simulation on the inside of

71
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:09,030
a black hole with design movie,
Bro,

72
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,520
that it was just.
This is just animation,

73
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,900
so the idea is you go through the black
hole and you wake up again,

74
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,040
a baby and Louisiana,
America you mama's cuddling.

75
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:25,870
You owe you such a sweet thing.
Birds Chirping,

76
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,830
but they're.
They're chirping 200 trillion light

77
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:31,510
years away.
Yeah.

78
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,860
You believe it,
I believe is a weird word.

79
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,530
Do you seal it?
It's too big.

80
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,720
I don't even feel son.
The son.

81
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:41,890
I go outside and I go,
oh yeah,

82
00:03:41,891 --> 00:03:44,020
it's warm,
but I don't feel that there's a thing

83
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:47,470
that's a million times bigger than earth
that's floating in the sky.

84
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,820
No,
I don't feel that.

85
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,940
To me,
the hard part for me is when they say

86
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:54,700
that the universe keeps expanding,
you know?

87
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,590
Yeah.
It sounds like something a child would

88
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:59,440
say.
That part sounds to me like it just

89
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:01,270
keeps growing and growing and growing
and growing.

90
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:01,871
You're like,
what?

91
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:04,590
It sounds like something like my four
year old nephew would say if like he

92
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,070
won't go to sleep at night,
you know?

93
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,050
Well,
the real one is the birth of the

94
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:09,430
universe.
That's the real one,

95
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,580
like the big bang.
So before the Big Bang,

96
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:14,560
the universe was smaller than the head
of a pin,

97
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,360
the whole thing.
Right?

98
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,640
And then for some reason,
boom,

99
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,960
they don't know why,
but in one instant the universe created

100
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,480
seemed farfetched.
But that's what the scientists believe.

101
00:04:29,661 --> 00:04:33,100
Forget about what religious people
believe or cult leaders believe,

102
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:38,101
or schizophrenia x the logit of legit,
the Sean Carol's of the world,

103
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:43,600
the Neil degrasse Tyson's of the world,
the real scientists that can hit you

104
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:46,000
with the real words and they actually
understand them.

105
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,280
The smartest people,
the real smart people.

106
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,340
They actually think that,
hmm.

107
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,453
What do you think?

108
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,060
I think the jury's out.
That's what I think.

109
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,920
Then I think I'm still kind of feeling
it out,

110
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,980
you know?
I think that I think I could easily get

111
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:05,980
sucked in if I'm not careful to just
believe in.

112
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,950
I just wonder if some of their stuff is
right.

113
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:10,900
You know,
like what if the building blocks that we

114
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:13,960
started with aren't really correct,
you know?

115
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,840
And sometimes I feel like they,
some of the science for me,

116
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:21,820
it takes too much of the hope out of it.
Like I guess I want to Romanticize the

117
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,420
universe a little bit and I want it to
be a little more fantastical.

118
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:27,270
Like maybe we get out there,
you know,

119
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,260
in the secret of that video and there's
a couple,

120
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,080
you know,
angels out there or a band or something

121
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,910
or like a,
you know,

122
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:35,710
some angels are like,
uh,

123
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,040
you know,
some sort of something more exciting

124
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,530
than just,
is that exciting or is that just more

125
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,560
human like angels and a band.
Right.

126
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,660
That's like human.
That'd actually be boring.

127
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:47,950
Yeah.
Maybe it's just me.

128
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,530
Maybe I'm afraid to go into that other
world,

129
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:52,030
you know,
into that other realm.

130
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:54,760
Like if somebody was like,
go in there and they were trying to push

131
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:57,410
me in there,
I would say I'm not going in there.

132
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:57,980
Have you ever

133
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,840
been in a place where you're in a or
you're outside at night?

134
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,470
There's no clouds and there's no light
pollution and you could see the Milky

135
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:08,230
Way.
Arizona Tucson.

136
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:09,863
It's crazy,
right?

137
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,210
Yeah.
It's a weird feeling.

138
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,190
Yes.
The all those stars and you're like,

139
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,800
is this up here all the time?
Yeah.

140
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:17,630
That's how I feel.
I feel like.

141
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:19,640
Is this out here all the time and what
have I been doing?

142
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,980
Yeah,
I think we're fucking ourselves up

143
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,450
cities.
I've been saying that forever.

144
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,740
I think all that light from cities
blocking out all those stars.

145
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,090
I think it confuses us.
We don't,

146
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,600
we don't realize what we're in.
We are in this crazy space ride.

147
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,330
Oh,
I think people forget about that a lot

148
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:38,980
of times.
I mean,

149
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,580
we definitely get caught up in the
minutia.

150
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,090
I mean,
but what's out there in the world and

151
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:44,960
the universe.

152
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,960
I mean,
I think if something were out there,

153
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,410
it would have stopped by now.
I don't know about that.

154
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,340
It's been a lot of time.
It's a lot of space on a space that has

155
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:58,400
to go through.
I think that things get so smart that

156
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:00,350
they don't do that anymore.
This is what I think.

157
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,080
Um,
I think that this whole idea about space

158
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:05,600
travel,
I don't think they do that after awhile.

159
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,730
I think they get so fucking smart,
they become symbiotic with machines and

160
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,200
I think artificial life and artificial
intelligence,

161
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,620
they create their own reality and
literally create their own universes.

162
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:17,750
I don't think they bothered traveling.
Oh,

163
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:19,430
they're just thinking it up and then
there it is.

164
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,370
I think they make things,
you know,

165
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,680
I think when,
I think this is just a thought,

166
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,450
but I think what's going to happen with
us.

167
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,950
I mean,
we'd take little trips,

168
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,570
send a rover to Mars and shit.

169
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:33,080
Then we sent probes into space Florida
anywhere.

170
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,820
You know what I mean?
You go local,

171
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,730
anything know it can be a big adventure,
but yeah,

172
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:39,680
we'd go out to the moon.
We went to the moon a couple of times,

173
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:40,600
supposedly,
you know.

174
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,050
Right.
But what we don't do,

175
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,850
what,
you know,

176
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,900
what we're doing with these little tiny
trips,

177
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:47,870
it's all fairly close.
It's all inside of our solar system,

178
00:07:47,871 --> 00:07:48,704
right?
Yeah.

179
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,560
What we're saying is that someone is
going way,

180
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:52,820
way,
way further than that,

181
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:54,740
so they would have to be way more
advanced than that.

182
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,550
What I look at us and I look at
artificial life and artificial

183
00:07:58,551 --> 00:08:01,400
intelligence and how close we are to
creating something that's smarter than

184
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:04,640
us within the next hundred years,
we're going to have some form of

185
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:09,200
artificial life that's probably way
smarter than us and it's gonna create

186
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,450
even better versions of artificial life.

187
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:16,430
It's going to improve upon the design
and then there's going to be things that

188
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:19,880
they can do in terms of like recreating
reality in your own mind,

189
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,670
like sit,
you and I sitting across from each

190
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:25,790
other.
We're experiencing this table.

191
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,160
We're experienced in looking at each
other.

192
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,500
We're friends.
We have a history together.

193
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:34,190
We talk a lot,
so we were used to being in each other's

194
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:36,830
presence.
There's all these feelings and thinking

195
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:38,990
and thoughts going on.
I think they're gonna be able to

196
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:41,450
recreate that.
I think they're going to recreate that

197
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:44,300
in a way that's indistinguishable from
this moment that we're experiencing

198
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:45,860
right now.
So then,

199
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,900
I mean,
you're human just going to become

200
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:49,040
obsolete then.
Yeah,

201
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,660
I think so.
Okay.

202
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,660
Well Dang it.
Dang it.

203
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,290
Don't you think we are.
I mean,

204
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,124
if you go back,

205
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,210
go back to single cell organisms,
go back to second Amoeba or something,

206
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:02,110
the first time,
single celled organisms as became

207
00:09:02,111 --> 00:09:04,190
multicell Logan's Bulgur and one of
them.

208
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,910
How many of them were hanging back?
No Man,

209
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:07,650
fuck that.
I'm going to live in the woods.

210
00:09:07,651 --> 00:09:12,420
I'm going to stay single cells.
Single cells way to go sell stuff is

211
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:13,950
bullshit.
I don't need to see things,

212
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:14,970
man.
Fuck you.

213
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:18,960
I don't need a phone motherfucker.
I'm a single cell organisms.

214
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,910
Oh Shit.
You know,

215
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,720
things don't have to get any better.
I'm like,

216
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,820
right,
like this.

217
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:28,680
I'm not going to get a job and be a
hitman.

218
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,570
So if you looked at single celled
organism,

219
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,110
they eventually became Theo Vaughn.
Right?

220
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,770
That's a.
that's a complicated leap from single

221
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:41,310
celled organisms from billions of years
ago to Theo von Holy Shit.

222
00:09:41,311 --> 00:09:43,590
Is that a leap to,
to a human.

223
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:46,230
That's a big leap.
So you're saying it would be crazy for

224
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:48,030
us if we didn't continue to move
forward.

225
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,410
We're going to.
That's a good point.

226
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,780
It's going to happen.
Everything does.

227
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,520
We're gonna improve upon this.
I mean,

228
00:09:53,521 --> 00:09:56,130
we're different now.
People are bigger and stronger and

229
00:09:56,131 --> 00:09:58,920
faster than they were just 100 years ago
because the nutrition,

230
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,860
you know,
and those genes now was saying that the

231
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:06,330
genes that people who exercise and are
healthy are better than the genes of

232
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:10,410
people that don't like.
You literally can transfer some of those

233
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:13,620
traits and some of that potential into
children.

234
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,290
Rhonda Patrick at something.
She tweeted about that a couple of days

235
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,100
ago,
I believe.

236
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,080
Oh,
this a mud rats out there that have no

237
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:21,600
jeans almost.
I feel like like mud rat humans.

238
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:26,680
Just people that are just smoking their
own dicks out there who have no real

239
00:10:26,681 --> 00:10:27,120
life.
Like,

240
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,010
you know what I'm saying?
Like I'd met some people who,

241
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,450
yeah,
they're breathing,

242
00:10:30,451 --> 00:10:31,740
but that's it.

243
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,491
Really.
Yeah.

244
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:35,580
This idea that we're all equals.
You've never met anybody.

245
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:38,010
That's genius.
If you say that I've met some people

246
00:10:38,011 --> 00:10:39,150
that I'm like,
I talked to them.

247
00:10:39,151 --> 00:10:39,541
I go,
oh,

248
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:43,760
I'm like a monkey
dude.

249
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,340
I talked to your Buddy Eddie Bravo,
and that guy is a real.

250
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,900
He's out there.
He's like a jack.

251
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,390
He's like a deaf deaf Jack Russell
almost,

252
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:53,100
you know,
a deaf Jack Russell,

253
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:54,690
because once he gets going you can't.
Oh,

254
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:55,720
Jack Russell terrier.
Yeah.

255
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,990
You ever been around with the dog?
You opened the car and then next thing

256
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:58,824
you know they're.
Yeah,

257
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,270
they're like sick.
Yeah,

258
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,350
but well,
how's he depth?

259
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,020
Because you can't get them back.
Like once he goes,

260
00:11:04,021 --> 00:11:07,440
you can't say you can't get them back in
the car.

261
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,610
Like you're sitting there honking the
horn.

262
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,560
You can't that guys out there.
You know what I'm talking about talking

263
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,470
about.
But I might make a description like

264
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:20,304
that.

265
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,800
Jack Russell terrier.
That is hilarious.

266
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:25,350
Extravagant did.
That means extravagant.

267
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:29,280
He's so motivated.
He loves conspiracies more than anybody

268
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:31,320
I've ever met in my life.
And he thinks everything is a

269
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:32,670
conspiracy.
Yeah.

270
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:33,121
No,
no,

271
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:33,954
he definitely.
Yeah.

272
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,820
But then he gets into it,
like,

273
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,430
I dunno,
it was fascinating to me how he went

274
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:42,090
from this like one genre of life to the
next and created a business in each one

275
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,190
and kept moving forward.
A business.

276
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:44,971
Yeah.
He got like,

277
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,230
he was amused.
He liked music.

278
00:11:46,231 --> 00:11:47,820
He started a band,
you know,

279
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:50,340
he liked a karate.
He started doing,

280
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,200
um,
you know,

281
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:54,160
organized karate.
He liked,

282
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,510
uh,
you know,

283
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:57,640
what else did he pee?
A couple of other businesses.

284
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:59,200
I think he got into a couple of other
things.

285
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:03,700
I don't know what the other two.
He lost me a chapter 70,

286
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,070
but he'll hit you with too much
information.

287
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:07,010
Man.
It was crazy.

288
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,680
A lot of people to Google.
I was like,

289
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:12,150
I want to climb through a black hole
right now into a shit.

290
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,301
Like,
wait a minute.

291
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:14,350
Is this guy legit?
Dude.

292
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:17,010
The other night to him,
he sends a couple of links.

293
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,490
You got to shut your phone off at a
friends with Eddie on was 1:00 AM phone

294
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,680
calls coming in that spot because you
will get,

295
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,150
you will get a wall of text explaining
which youtube video has the right

296
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:30,610
information.
Which one is set up by the CIA.

297
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,910
It used to be like stopping at a rest
area on the interstate.

298
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,180
That was like the old Eddie Bravo.
He'd stopped there and next thing you

299
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:38,530
know,
you'd hear the craziest shit in the

300
00:12:38,531 --> 00:12:39,390
world,
right?

301
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:44,470
He used to be playing in the background.
Now he loves all of it.

302
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,540
He loves it,
but he's.

303
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,110
He gets out,
he goes in phases,

304
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,830
like he gets out of them for awhile,
like he was really into chem trails for

305
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:52,630
awhile,
but man,

306
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,150
I know he probably won't admit it,
but it's pretty obvious.

307
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:57,550
Chem trails are bullshit.
Fucking obvious.

308
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,500
It's just writing because they can write
birthday,

309
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:01,930
they can write happy birthday,
Rhonda or something and that's not.

310
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,830
That just seems like it's smoke
somebody's birthday that I think when

311
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:08,260
they do that they're doing that on
purpose,

312
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,230
but the chem trail things just,
it's just nonsense.

313
00:13:11,231 --> 00:13:13,660
There's,
there is some evidence that they have

314
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:17,410
experimented with spraying stuff in the
sky and they definitely seed clouds and

315
00:13:17,411 --> 00:13:19,540
certain parts of the world in certain
parts of the country.

316
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:23,530
You know,
they can make it rain like a in Abu

317
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,070
Dhabi,
right?

318
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,080
Where they make it rain once a week.
Wow.

319
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,120
Once a week.
It's there.

320
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,710
They live in the desert jets up there.
Yeah.

321
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:33,070
Yeah.
They send jets and I think they use

322
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,640
something silver iodine or something
like that.

323
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:39,280
Is that what it is?
It's one of those pilots,

324
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:43,780
they spray into the clouds and somehow
or another it makes it rain.

325
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,470
He know when Eddie came,
when I was talking to him with any one

326
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:51,220
thing I was thinking about was,
do you think that there are aliens?

327
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,860
Oh,
do you think that robots will get so

328
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:58,861
advanced that they will like become
aware and what does he say?

329
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,160
Oh,
I don't know what he said.

330
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:06,280
I guess I'm asking you because he went
off on something else and he didn't

331
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:07,510
really answer it.
He said,

332
00:14:07,511 --> 00:14:09,520
it doesn't get too much into artificial
intelligence.

333
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:12,160
He's more into like,
the FBI tried to fuck us over.

334
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,930
Yeah.
Well he told me in the bathroom after we

335
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:15,640
talked,
no joke.

336
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:19,810
He said he had to be a little bit quiet
because he thinks that some people could

337
00:14:19,811 --> 00:14:21,790
be looking for.
Oh,

338
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,990
that's so crazy.
And it was crazy.

339
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,950
He said that all hush hush about the
urinals.

340
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,730
Dude.
He thought that the government got to me

341
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:31,600
really because I wasn't in chem trails.
Chem trails would did it.

342
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,201
He's like,
just got.

343
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:34,270
It's got to be a reason here.
Did they do anything to you?

344
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:35,530
No.
No.

345
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,130
You swear?
I swear no one's talked to me about

346
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:41,230
anything ever.
No one said,

347
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:42,850
hey man,
layoff,

348
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,450
bigfoot bigfoot talk.
But what are you saying?

349
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:49,540
I'm just saying if you want to know.
I don't.

350
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,230
I manage this.
What are you showing me,

351
00:14:51,231 --> 00:14:53,390
Jamie?
This is the article about the cloud

352
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:56,780
seeding and Abu Dhabi that they use
high.

353
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,070
Wow.
Hi.

354
00:14:58,071 --> 00:15:03,071
Grows scopic salt to level up the amount
of amount of moisture to generate more

355
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:06,290
rain.
Huh?

356
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,780
I could see him doing that.
Dr Habib.

357
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,990
Adding that.
The best season for seeding is between

358
00:15:11,991 --> 00:15:13,310
June and August.
Huh?

359
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,050
Hm.
So I mean there's,

360
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,110
there's solid up into.
Yes,

361
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,460
they spray shit and it makes it rain.
I find that the moon state,

362
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:23,750
we went to the moon,
the moon send makes sense.

363
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,850
Delta could get to if you really think
about it,

364
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,380
like you know what I'm saying to
airlines like southwest though,

365
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,880
right?
I mean I'm a little shaky,

366
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,660
a little bit shaky on there.
Some of the people are and they're

367
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,730
wearing shorts,
you know,

368
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:39,200
you get on it.
I don't trust anybody in his shorts,

369
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:41,330
especially at church,
but um,

370
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,630
I'll say this when you like,
it's crazy.

371
00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:46,520
We've been flying across America for,
you know,

372
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,050
40,
50 years now,

373
00:15:48,051 --> 00:15:49,100
right?
Yeah.

374
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:50,420
Even more maybe,
you know,

375
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,980
and it seems like it's.
We could figure out how to get into

376
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,790
space.
It's harder than that for sure.

377
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,170
First of all,
it's 260,

378
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:01,580
2000 miles,
you know,

379
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:06,260
the earth is 24,000 miles around,
so a full trip from right here.

380
00:16:06,261 --> 00:16:11,090
So you start in Calabasas and you do a
full trip all the way around the planet

381
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:14,900
and land in Calabasas that's 24,000
miles.

382
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,270
Okay.
So it's like 12 times at or something.

383
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,640
Yeah.
Something like that.

384
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:23,580
Well,
we could do that was we

385
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,320
these we shit.

386
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,380
It's hard bed and not only that,
there's no air.

387
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,220
It's one six earth's gravity because
you're dealing with all sorts of

388
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:41,540
problems in terms of solar flares and
radiation were protected by the

389
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:45,290
magnetosphere,
were protected by the radiation belts

390
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,360
and you know,
all of the,

391
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,510
the atmosphere of the earth.
When you go through that and you go out

392
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:52,190
into the space,
you're not protected by shit.

393
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,820
We couldn't.
We,

394
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,510
I think we can fight that man.
Well,

395
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,660
it can be done.
The problem was with biological life.

396
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,010
See,
one of the things that made it so

397
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:03,770
interesting about the moon hoax there,
particularly for me,

398
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,880
so it never sent anything alive in the
space and had to come back alive ever.

399
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,540
They never said they never even sent a
chicken in the space and had to come

400
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,800
back a lot.
It all dies.

401
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,060
No,
they just do it with people.

402
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:17,630
They've only done it with peep a.
they've never made something.

403
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,630
They never shot a monkey in a space and
then brought it back alive.

404
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:22,400
So that's why you think it could be
fictional?

405
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,430
No,
it's the only one reason why it was

406
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,490
enticing to me.
One of the big reasons was the Fox

407
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:30,770
documentary.
There was a fox documentary that aired

408
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:33,080
on tv,
I think it was in the nineties.

409
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,670
It was called conspiracy theory.
Did we go to the moon and it showed that

410
00:17:37,671 --> 00:17:42,671
they use the same backdrop for different
moon missions that were supposedly like

411
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,420
really far apart from each other,
but the back backdrops sinked up.

412
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:52,870
There was all sorts of images that
showed different shadows that we're

413
00:17:54,211 --> 00:17:57,870
moving at different angles that would
indicate different light sources that

414
00:17:57,871 --> 00:18:00,870
was more than one life source instead of
the just the sun.

415
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,210
There's a lot of these things that make
it intriguing.

416
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:08,240
The problem with that stuff is that I
don't know Jack Shit about aerospace

417
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:10,950
engineering.
I don't know anything about it.

418
00:18:10,951 --> 00:18:15,450
I have zero,
zero education in physics.

419
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:18,110
How Kodak works in space.
I don't know how any of that.

420
00:18:18,111 --> 00:18:19,920
That's also part of the problem is the
images,

421
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,050
the images.
A lot of people like how are the images

422
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:24,660
so perfectly squared.
There's no errors.

423
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,020
There's some of the images where things
are in the shadows.

424
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:30,060
They're lit up like there's backfill
being used,

425
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,860
but that still doesn't mean they didn't
go.

426
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,190
They definitely faked some images.
This is a fact.

427
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,500
They know this because there's Gemini
Fifteen,

428
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,040
there's a Michael Collins photo.
That was absolutely a photo that they

429
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:44,910
used of him in a training mission and
where you could see the harnesses and

430
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:47,130
all that jazz,
and then they blacked it out and they

431
00:18:47,131 --> 00:18:50,070
use it as a publicity photo saying that
he's on a space walk,

432
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,980
but that could have been an overzealous
publicist.

433
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,130
You got to look at everything like
really objectively.

434
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,460
Yes.
You wanted.

435
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,450
I,
I wanted the moon landing to be fake.

436
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:02,440
It seemed fun to me.
I wanted it to be.

437
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,430
There's so many things that the,
the um,

438
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,990
what is it?
The Prime Minister of Holland who is in

439
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,170
Holland and I met Bazal.
They met,

440
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:15,410
they gave this guy a piece of moon rock
and it turned out to be a piece of

441
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:18,050
petrified wood,
but it was signed in.

442
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:22,830
A plaque was delivered by Michael
Collins and Buzz Aldrin and Neil

443
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,161
Armstrong,
and they're like,

444
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:24,880
this is a piece of moon rock for,
you know,

445
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,970
we're giving this to Holland.
This is amazing.

446
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:27,811
Like,
wow,

447
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:29,460
you've given us a piece of the moon.
That's so cool.

448
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,680
And then they finally wound up finding
any testing it.

449
00:19:31,681 --> 00:19:34,590
It's a piece of petrified wood.
It wasn't for the moon is fake.

450
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,340
It's fake.

451
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,570
Yeah.
And one of the Dutch law,

452
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,300
things like that.
It's a gift to a control.

453
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:42,720
I say the Dutch are wild man,
but that also could have been.

454
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,450
You got to deal with.
You're talking about the 19 sixties.

455
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,490
Richard Nixon was the president.
He was an asshole.

456
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,240
You know who needs like probably fuck
them.

457
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,590
Not Giving them a moon rock.
Get,

458
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,030
get,
get,

459
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,270
get one of those petrified.
This will be full area.

460
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:57,360
Take a piece of petrified wood.
We got four kilograms of moon rock.

461
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:01,030
Shit to the Dutch.
The Dutch.

462
00:20:01,031 --> 00:20:02,100
I mean this shit.
They don't.

463
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,260
Yeah,
I mean actually who gives a fuck,

464
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,223
you know,
like,

465
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,870
you know,
respect to the Dutch,

466
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:09,600
but some of the greatest boxers of all
time.

467
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,270
Really that one spot.
Well they're aerodynamic till you ever

468
00:20:12,271 --> 00:20:15,400
seen a Dutch person to pig will and also
there rick streaming,

469
00:20:15,401 --> 00:20:17,450
you can look at their faces are
extremely or dynamic.

470
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,980
Seemed to travel through space better.
Is that what you're saying?

471
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,860
I think if you take like one of the
front of a plane,

472
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,320
you know,
it wouldn't be that hard on him.

473
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,840
Good to have good symmetry that we were
saying,

474
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,670
Oh,
you look at the Dutch,

475
00:20:29,671 --> 00:20:31,620
their heads tall,
right.

476
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:36,440
It's like I'm good genes.
Probably Vikings.

477
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,400
Right.
That's probably some viking genes hold

478
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,160
the big.
They're really big people and they got

479
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,280
total craniums space.
They have a lot of room in their head

480
00:20:44,281 --> 00:20:46,020
for ideas.
Yeah.

481
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:47,980
Plus they will.
One of

482
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,780
the first people to say who gives a shit
about weed?

483
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,000
Everybody used to go to Amsterdam to get
high.

484
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,580
Well the problem with Amsterdam is
there's those trains,

485
00:20:54,581 --> 00:20:56,860
there's people on bikes.
It's like the worst place to walk around

486
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:59,590
high because there's so many forms of
transportation going on.

487
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,820
There's fucking people traveling by Cro.
Like I tripped out there man.

488
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,760
Right.
This is like boats.

489
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
There's a way to have both people get on
boats and shit did I showed up there one

490
00:21:14,171 --> 00:21:16,540
time and they had to um,
gay pride weekend,

491
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,860
you know,
and I didn't know it and they had like a

492
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:22,861
lot of homoerotic like boat floats going
Bolick just single men just dance day

493
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,540
it.
I was like,

494
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,030
I didn't know.
I thought that was just,

495
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,810
these people were like,
Hella Dutch.

496
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,330
Gay people know how to do it.
Oh yeah.

497
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,190
They party mailing,
holding them back.

498
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,400
There's no Yang or you know,
whichever one it is.

499
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,640
They're all Yang.
Yeah.

500
00:21:38,641 --> 00:21:40,890
It's just people Yang in each other's
seems.

501
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:43,750
Yeah.
I ended up just and each other.

502
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:46,510
I know that's happening in space,
in space somewhere.

503
00:21:46,511 --> 00:21:47,860
This gay people,
they can get pregnant

504
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,510
to get each other pregnant and they're
gay because how?

505
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,090
Because the different guaranteed.
Oh,

506
00:21:55,091 --> 00:21:56,260
you think that?
Oh yeah.

507
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,610
One hundred percent.
There's gay pride.

508
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,920
Whoa.
Jamie just pulled out what it was brown

509
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,600
and I thought,
Holy Shit.

510
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,810
I got one 10th of one percent get just
from looking at that as aerodynamic as a

511
00:22:05,811 --> 00:22:06,430
king.
Get it,

512
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,800
boy.
And no one has a shirt on.

513
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,500
It was a couple of guys with life
preservers.

514
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,020
No one has a fucking shirt.
I'll look how gay this is.

515
00:22:14,021 --> 00:22:16,750
This is hilarious.
They're all buffered shit.

516
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,960
There's one girl with her hand on her
forehead and the front of the book on

517
00:22:19,961 --> 00:22:20,290
what?

518
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,840
In the fuck.
I can't get no dick.

519
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,000
She's like,
her friend tells me you've got to get

520
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:28,060
down here.
There's a thousand men with no shirt on

521
00:22:28,061 --> 00:22:30,640
and they're all hot.
Oh my God.

522
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,260
I'm there.
I'm there.

523
00:22:32,261 --> 00:22:34,930
I'm going to get us ride on the boat.
An hour into the boat.

524
00:22:34,931 --> 00:22:38,100
She's got her hand and I had fucked me.
They're all gay.

525
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,580
And that kind of slipped this too on the
right if you could see that.

526
00:22:40,581 --> 00:22:41,460
I think so,
yeah.

527
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,000
One of his hips a little higher.
I have that display show

528
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,740
and it's popular in people that have
that.

529
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,120
And also Australia.
No,

530
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,520
you think he's just like standing on
something that could be just to stop

531
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:54,783
moving.
Fine.

532
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,360
Seemed like he feels self conscious
about his legs he has on patients.

533
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,700
It's hot out there.
You don't think so maybe,

534
00:23:00,701 --> 00:23:02,110
right?
Like you can't squat anymore.

535
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,310
Oh yeah.
Dude,

536
00:23:03,311 --> 00:23:05,740
I'm in that bad back club man.
It's hard when you get that.

537
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:09,490
I just had a just,
I think God just put like a week spine

538
00:23:09,491 --> 00:23:14,491
and me and so when I was 27 I was paint.
I was painting a wall and I lean for

539
00:23:16,841 --> 00:23:20,800
like maybe 40 minutes leaning out with a
paint thing and when I lean back in my

540
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:22,570
back wasn't right anymore.
That was it.

541
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,610
And it's been bad ever since.
Really?

542
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,230
Yeah.
I'd have part of my vertebrae.

543
00:23:26,231 --> 00:23:28,630
Somebody.
This man took it out at Cedar Sinai.

544
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,800
Man.
He took it out.

545
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:30,790
Yeah.
What did he do it?

546
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,570
Did you know him first?
Met Him through insurance,

547
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,080
but he got it and they and I've been.
It's been hit or miss since then.

548
00:23:40,091 --> 00:23:41,680
What's he doing with it?
Oh,

549
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:43,570
I don't know.
They can't afford to go back and see

550
00:23:43,571 --> 00:23:44,800
them again.
It's 7,500 bucks.

551
00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:45,700
You can go to them.

552
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:49,600
It's like I got a scam.
That's a scam.

553
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,530
Want to talk to me?
You sit on that side of the day and

554
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:57,670
$7,500 for your time starts now
you're back.

555
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,830
Yeah.
Okay.

556
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:05,831
Next person.
Is it like a disc or a piece of the

557
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,660
actual bone?
Like what was it?

558
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,220
It's a disc.
They got photos of it.

559
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,900
I don't know if they're real,
you know,

560
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,690
that'd be crazy part the moon landing.
Well here's the data,

561
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,460
here's the credit.
Put you under and said,

562
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:17,181
yeah,
we fixed it,

563
00:24:17,181 --> 00:24:18,230
bro.
Give me that money.

564
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,193
Oh,
100 percent.

565
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,770
And then in my head,
you know,

566
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:24,550
cause I'm probably about 60 percent
gullible sand.

567
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,870
Yeah,
I think so the more I look back at my

568
00:24:26,871 --> 00:24:29,100
life and kind of charted out,
went up and gullible and when I

569
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:30,920
happened,
what's the biggest one that you look

570
00:24:30,921 --> 00:24:31,550
back and go,
ha,

571
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:31,970
fuck that.

572
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,790
I believe that.
Um,

573
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:40,540
I would say probably
real overall religion.

574
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,510
Probably when I was super religious when
you were a kid.

575
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:47,360
I wasn't super religious,
but I,

576
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,180
you know,
I just wanted it all,

577
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,510
like everything,
like in the bar,

578
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,210
you know,
I just wanted it to be real.

579
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,850
Yeah,
I guess I wanted it to be real.

580
00:24:54,851 --> 00:24:55,970
Right.
It just made it hard.

581
00:24:55,971 --> 00:24:58,190
It made it tough for some other things.
You know,

582
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,450
you're like,
first it was like,

583
00:24:59,451 --> 00:25:01,040
fuck,
I gotta remember all this shit.

584
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:04,730
Like I can't remember.
I'm not going to be able to be accepted

585
00:25:04,731 --> 00:25:07,730
by God or something because I can't even
remember what's in this book.

586
00:25:07,731 --> 00:25:09,440
You know,
like I'm going to need to hire a tutor

587
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,810
just to be,
go to heaven,

588
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:12,740
you know,
like,

589
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,740
because the Bible is bro,
it's not the best book.

590
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,270
Well it was really good when it was
written yet.

591
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,890
It's like trying to watch a movie from
the 19 thirties.

592
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,410
You'd be like,
look at this Corny fucking acting.

593
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,273
Yeah,
right.

594
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,123
Yeah,
yeah.

595
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,540
You know what I mean?
I mean there's nine chapters about

596
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:31,100
livestock.
Like it gets,

597
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,980
it gets,
it gets held risk,

598
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:36,830
a in the middle.
Really read the whole thing cover to

599
00:25:36,831 --> 00:25:39,590
cover and I haven't read any of it in a
long time.

600
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,480
Yeah,
I read it when I was in,

601
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,640
when I was in,
I guess I was,

602
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,340
I was living in Florida,
so I was 11.

603
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,110
Oh,
that's a good time to read them out in

604
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:50,930
school and I remember my parents being a
little disturbed,

605
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,940
but because I'd gone from a Catholic
school and the first grade my mom split

606
00:25:56,571 --> 00:25:59,490
up with my dad,
my mom shacked up with my Stepdad who

607
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,120
was a hippie.
She kind of became a bit of a hippie too

608
00:26:02,121 --> 00:26:03,620
and we fell way out of religion.

609
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,770
So the Catholic church and all that
stuff was a thing of the past.

610
00:26:06,771 --> 00:26:08,930
Was that pretty cool?
The hippie Stepdad.

611
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,210
He's a good guy.
Very nice guy.

612
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,640
It was weird,
you know,

613
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,340
he had long hair and shit,
like long hair,

614
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,040
like down to the middle of his back and
so like,

615
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,650
like crazy.
Would you ever like see him from behind?

616
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,320
I think it was like a woman or something
from Pharrell.

617
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,740
Well because he was muscular,
you know,

618
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,510
he looked like a man,
but he's a man with long hair.

619
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,280
Yeah.
But um,

620
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,170
you know,
uh,

621
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:36,370
when I was in high school,
well not high school,

622
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,410
I guess it was in a great school.
So what is 11?

623
00:26:39,411 --> 00:26:41,840
What grade is that?
Depends on how smart you are.

624
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:42,920
Really Great.
Fifth Grade.

625
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,700
Yeah.
Depends on how smart you are.

626
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,640
You know what I was reading?
This is how great Ronan Farrow,

627
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,880
you know Woody Allen and I'm the guy who
wrote that article.

628
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,540
Yeah.
Yeah.

629
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,520
He's not really woody Allen's kid.
By the way.

630
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,920
Look at that kid.
Look at Frank Sinatra.

631
00:26:55,921 --> 00:26:57,800
Holla at your boy.
Say

632
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,130
that kid is Frank Sinatra's kid.
One thousand,

633
00:27:05,131 --> 00:27:08,910
1 million percent because mia farrow
used to bang Frank Sinatra.

634
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,830
Oh really?
They had a freak.

635
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,270
Look,
I know.

636
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,930
Look,
come on.

637
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,380
Get the fuck Outta here.
Look at it.

638
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,120
First of all,
handsome men.

639
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,910
That Ronan Farrow.
Handsome man.

640
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,280
Yeah,
that is God dammit.

641
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,150
That is Frank Sinatra's kid.
One billion.

642
00:27:27,151 --> 00:27:29,820
Trillion percent.
You better stay the fuck away from 23

643
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:31,290
and me out that.
Yeah.

644
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,380
Look at that 23 and we'll just send back
the song.

645
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:37,410
New York,
New York when he was 11.

646
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,450
This how smart this guy is.
When he was 11,

647
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:41,910
he was taking college courses.
Oh my God.

648
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,010
11 nerd alert.
That's what I read.

649
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,270
Makes sure that's true.
I don't want to write an article about

650
00:27:48,271 --> 00:27:50,190
me.
Spirit of bad information,

651
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:55,610
but so they had a freak relationship
anyway when they were together.

652
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,130
That was their only biological kid and
it's not really their biological kid.

653
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,550
Why not?
Because it's fucking Frank Sinatra's kid

654
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,850
started college at age 11.
Wow.

655
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,050
He says he fell apart while pursuing the
Harvey Weinstein Story.

656
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:13,530
What do you mean he fell apart?
Probably because it was so dark.

657
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,370
Oh,
I mean,

658
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,320
come on,
man.

659
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,060
Do you remember before that story came
out?

660
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,100
Everybody knew that guy was a creep.
Right?

661
00:28:20,101 --> 00:28:22,440
But it was like this thing about like,
like more door,

662
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,730
you know,
like he lives,

663
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,290
you know,
lived in Iran,

664
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,320
lives under a rock somewhere.
Everybody knew he was a creep.

665
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,000
You,
everybody had heard stories.

666
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,600
But this guy,
he graduated at 15 from college.

667
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:39,500
Oh my God.
Why does he keep saying the son of Mia

668
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,000
Farrow and Woody Allen?
It should say wink,

669
00:28:42,001 --> 00:28:43,110
wink,
nudge,

670
00:28:43,111 --> 00:28:44,460
nudge.
But that's crazy though.

671
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,650
They're trying to push that so much.
You know,

672
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,330
the son of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen.

673
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,000
Well,
he was raised by them for a little while

674
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:53,790
until he started banging his sister.
I'm like,

675
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,870
God,
yeah,

676
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:58,350
that's a freak household.
And then the dark arts out here,

677
00:28:58,351 --> 00:29:00,030
Hollywood's got the darkest arts,
Bro.

678
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,880
They lived in New York.
Well even New York,

679
00:29:02,881 --> 00:29:05,430
Hollywood,
because some of it's the same thing.

680
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,360
New York,
Hollywood.

681
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,020
Hollywood is just show business.
Yeah,

682
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,120
show business.
That's what I mean.

683
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,040
Well,
there's definitely something to that

684
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:15,300
because how about that composer that
turned out to be even more of a fucking

685
00:29:15,301 --> 00:29:18,900
asshole and Harvey Weinstein,
this is one composer that was just

686
00:29:18,901 --> 00:29:22,710
fucking all these young boys and if you
didn't fuck him and they just.

687
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:27,300
They recently got rid of him,
but he was just running things through

688
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:30,420
sex and you know,
he just basically had a sex cult going

689
00:29:30,421 --> 00:29:32,130
on.
Find out who the fuck that guy was.

690
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:37,220
But he was a cherished famous loved
composer and it turned out this.

691
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,980
This dude was running the freak show
behind the dirty,

692
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,010
just not just being

693
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,140
dirty,
but that was the way to get in and if

694
00:29:44,141 --> 00:29:46,680
this guy is shut you down,
you were shut down forever.

695
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:49,600
You weren't working anymore.
So he was like the.

696
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:52,200
He was the gatekeeper kind.
He was like a Harvey Weinstein of music

697
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,980
team,
like what Harvey Weinstein was doing to

698
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:55,840
those actresses is he would try to fuck
them.

699
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,820
They'd get mad at him and he would
blackball them.

700
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,320
He would say,
you're not working anymore.

701
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,500
You're too difficult to work with,
and then he would shut their careers

702
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:03,640
down.
All these different.

703
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,920
These different women found out like
when they,

704
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,470
their careers fell apart,
they found out that was going on.

705
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,450
There is what happened.
What happened.

706
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,580
See,
that's dirty man.

707
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,301
Oh,
him,

708
00:30:13,301 --> 00:30:14,170
Huh?
Yeah.

709
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:19,290
From the met James Levine.
Sexual abuse claims.

710
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,040
Yeah.
Well this is from December 2017,

711
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,050
but that has been.
It's been.

712
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:31,600
There's recent stuff put up,
pull up a sexual abuse James Levine

713
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:35,470
because the more recent stuff is much
more confirmed,

714
00:30:35,471 --> 00:30:39,580
like a bunch of people came out and we
had to do it in our neighborhood named

715
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:45,220
Mr Lang and Stein and he used to invite
us over to a chill out and shit,

716
00:30:45,221 --> 00:30:47,410
but we didn't know he was that he was a
pedophile,

717
00:30:47,411 --> 00:30:50,800
but you didn't know how to try now.

718
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:54,580
He ended up going to jail for it.
So you're hanging out with them for

719
00:30:54,581 --> 00:30:56,380
awhile and you didn't know.
Yeah,

720
00:30:56,381 --> 00:30:58,450
we met him at school.
We thought he was just as cool old dude

721
00:30:58,451 --> 00:31:00,220
who like to smoke pot,
right with children.

722
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,190
And one time he bought us some steaks
because he would like,

723
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,930
you know,
treat us nice,

724
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:05,651
you know,
and b,

725
00:31:05,651 --> 00:31:07,330
he would take us.
He took us to Marilyn Manson,

726
00:31:07,331 --> 00:31:09,050
me and my best friend,
he took us to Marilyn Manson.

727
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,630
We were like 15.
We couldn't even get in.

728
00:31:10,631 --> 00:31:12,730
It was 18 year old show.
And how old was he?

729
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,790
He was probably 70.
So,

730
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:19,750
and he had like a red convertible,
you know,

731
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:22,450
and that's,
everybody wants to be in a convertible

732
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:27,310
and so we got in and we went and um,
anyway,

733
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,180
he,
you know,

734
00:31:28,181 --> 00:31:30,010
he would,
he got us some stakes one time in the

735
00:31:30,011 --> 00:31:31,780
state,
come with baked potato side item.

736
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,200
So we had a sour cream on this,
on the baked potatoes and my buddy was

737
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:42,790
in and my buddy was in the kitchen and
he said,

738
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:45,190
hey,
I'm out of sour cream,

739
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,440
can I have some of yours?
And I said,

740
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:48,091
no,
but you can have.

741
00:31:48,091 --> 00:31:49,510
So in my sweet cream,
you know,

742
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:54,511
just making like a joke about semen and
then big and style and the dude goes,

743
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:59,470
can I have some?
And that's when all the fucking wheels

744
00:31:59,471 --> 00:32:03,220
turned and you realized,
oh no,

745
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,990
I'm just sitting there with a mouthful
of potato.

746
00:32:04,991 --> 00:32:07,450
Like fuck it.
He was just a nice man.

747
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:10,180
And you were thinking that this,
this whole time it was just setting you

748
00:32:10,181 --> 00:32:11,620
up?
Yeah.

749
00:32:11,621 --> 00:32:13,060
And my buddy,
that was the biggest thing,

750
00:32:13,061 --> 00:32:16,060
I was so concerned,
like I brought like for my friends over

751
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:18,700
there and I was like,
what has been going on?

752
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,190
I had a similar situation,
guy named Walter.

753
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,430
Yeah.
We used to go fishing and he would run

754
00:32:24,431 --> 00:32:28,480
around the pond and he was um,
he mentally handicap?

755
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,171
No,
no,

756
00:32:29,171 --> 00:32:32,410
he was,
he was a teacher and he got fired when I

757
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:36,940
was trying to explain to us that he had
uncommon unconventional teaching methods

758
00:32:36,941 --> 00:32:39,920
and that they didn't understand his
teaching methods and that

759
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,330
they fired him.
Oh.

760
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,720
So then he's like,
he's like the,

761
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,660
he's like,
it was a very smart guy and two kids,

762
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:49,200
he probably seemed like the cool guy
because he's like unconventional and he

763
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:50,170
was always jogging,
you know,

764
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,530
was always,
always jogging around this part.

765
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:52,603
Oh yeah,
that's a gay,

766
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:55,100
straight bi.
And he would sit,

767
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,410
he would combine hanging out with us.
So we'd be fishing,

768
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,040
we'd be hanging out the spot and he come
by,

769
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,510
sit with us for a little bit,
then take off.

770
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:06,740
So we became friends with this guy.
I went over his house once and I'll

771
00:33:06,741 --> 00:33:09,410
never forget I ate at his house.
It was just me and him too.

772
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:13,520
And he didn't do anything but went to
the bathroom and uh,

773
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:18,610
I guess I was 13 somewhere around there,
somewhere around 13 at the time.

774
00:33:18,771 --> 00:33:20,660
So while day is a susceptible age?

775
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,133
Yeah,
for sure.

776
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:23,683
And I,
uh,

777
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:27,410
I went to use the bathroom and I peed
and I guess he was in the bathroom with

778
00:33:27,411 --> 00:33:29,210
me and afterwards he said something to
me,

779
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,440
he goes on,
he had this weird way of talking and

780
00:33:32,441 --> 00:33:34,430
he's like,
I didn't know you were showed developed

781
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:36,051
again.
I was like,

782
00:33:36,051 --> 00:33:37,170
what?
And I was,

783
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,300
I was thinking about it.
I'm like,

784
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,420
I was talking about with Dick,
but he wasn't flirting with me.

785
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,430
It wasn't weird.
It just was like,

786
00:33:43,431 --> 00:33:46,220
he was just talking about my dick being
developed,

787
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:47,660
you know,
like a curator,

788
00:33:47,661 --> 00:33:50,170
like an art curator or something.
No,

789
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,710
it was just,
it wasn't,

790
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:54,500
it was weird,
but it wasn't dangerous.

791
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:58,550
But then it got dangerous because I'd
been friends with this guy for months.

792
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,950
Right.
For months we have been going fishing

793
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,980
and he had been coming to this lake.
There's two places.

794
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,630
There was a,
there was um,

795
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,240
Jamaica pond,
which was all in all,

796
00:34:08,241 --> 00:34:10,280
this was in Jamaica Plain.
And so there was,

797
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:13,490
Jamaica pond was this one spot and there
was another pond that was nearby that

798
00:34:13,491 --> 00:34:15,860
was a smaller place that was more
secluded,

799
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,470
but it had like good pickerl fishing
pickles,

800
00:34:18,471 --> 00:34:21,440
like a small northern pike looking
creature.

801
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:26,270
And so I was fishing there and pick her
up and stop coughing.

802
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,890
So he shows up drunk.
That's when it got really weird.

803
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,560
And he told me he loved me.
And uh,

804
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,090
the academy say it.
Did he say it?

805
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:35,931
He,
yeah,

806
00:34:35,931 --> 00:34:39,680
he said it like he was behind me,
like sitting down and I was fishing hot

807
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,220
dude that's making me.
He goes,

808
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,010
he goes,
you know,

809
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,851
Joey,
you know,

810
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:46,540
I love you.
And he was like,

811
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,420
probably in the sixties,
right?

812
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,600
And I go,
I like you too,

813
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:50,960
man.

814
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,840
I was like,
weirded out.

815
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:53,030
I didn't know what to do because he was
drunk,

816
00:34:53,031 --> 00:34:58,030
like definitely drunk goes,
there can be no love without sex cheap.

817
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,270
That's what he said.
And I went,

818
00:34:59,271 --> 00:35:02,840
what?
And I remember I had a Swiss army knife

819
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:07,160
in my pocket and I put my hand on the
Swiss army knife.

820
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,250
And uh,
I remember saying something like,

821
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,810
man,
you better leave me the fuck alone.

822
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,880
Like something along those lines.
Wow.

823
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:16,790
I've got him pulled the knife out
because I was 13 years old.

824
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:18,710
He was a pretty big guy.
I was like,

825
00:35:18,711 --> 00:35:21,980
even if I pulled his knife out,
am I really going to be able to stab him

826
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,160
seven or eight times?
Is this Guy gonna beat me to death and

827
00:35:25,161 --> 00:35:27,440
fuck me,
you know what's going to happen here?

828
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,270
But he left me alone.
He left me alone.

829
00:35:29,271 --> 00:35:32,480
But then he wrote a letter to my house.
So he found out where I lived.

830
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,260
Yeah.
And he probably had to get drunk to come

831
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:38,700
there and do that to be able to even say
that to you.

832
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:42,720
That's probably why I did it.
Like he was probably trying to figure

833
00:35:42,721 --> 00:35:45,630
out a way to work his way up to
molesting me.

834
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:50,640
So I think that's probably why he got
fired from school.

835
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,130
Yeah.
Yeah.

836
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:56,790
Do you feel a little bit bad that he had
led them on?

837
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,740
I was a little cutie DNA.
It's a kid.

838
00:36:07,741 --> 00:36:12,280
But did you feel a little bit bad that
he had kind of taken advantage of like,

839
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,440
like fuck,
now we can't kind of be free,

840
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,190
like you know,
like you think in ia that was.

841
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:21,720
I did enjoy talking to him because he
was telling me about things like he knew

842
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:24,840
a lot of things about life.
He was definitely a very educated guy.

843
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:29,890
So before the drunken weirdness and the
just the general,

844
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:32,760
it just got more.
The more comfortable he got with us,

845
00:36:32,761 --> 00:36:36,510
the more I realized that this guy was,
he was attracted to children and he was

846
00:36:36,511 --> 00:36:37,860
trying to fight it off.
I think,

847
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,420
you know,
I think a lot of people that are

848
00:36:39,421 --> 00:36:41,610
pedophiles are extremely embarrassed by
it.

849
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,050
Oh,
it's a sickness man.

850
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:43,800
Yeah.
Yeah.

851
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,310
I don't think it's something anybody
chooses to do unless they're trying to

852
00:36:47,311 --> 00:36:50,480
start like a track team or something
like maybe in the Philippines or south.

853
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:55,440
Well I ran into my friend Josh and I
told him immediately because Josh used

854
00:36:55,441 --> 00:36:58,920
to go fishing with me and we both knew
that guy and I explained to him the

855
00:36:58,921 --> 00:37:00,750
whole deal and he was like,
fuck.

856
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,630
And so he was scared too.
He was like,

857
00:37:03,631 --> 00:37:04,800
dude,
I'm gonna stab that fucking guy.

858
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,620
And Josh went extra hard.
He went extra hard,

859
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:08,221
like,
Oh,

860
00:37:08,221 --> 00:37:12,540
aggression and anger because his parents
were lesbians.

861
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,910
Oh,
he had two parents are lesbians.

862
00:37:14,911 --> 00:37:18,840
So he wanted,
I think he wanted me to know that he

863
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:20,340
wasn't gay.
Right.

864
00:37:20,341 --> 00:37:21,870
And it was mom's gay,
right?

865
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:23,520
I mean,
so it was like all fucked up.

866
00:37:23,521 --> 00:37:24,211
Fuck it,
you know,

867
00:37:24,211 --> 00:37:26,070
that kind of shit.
Like whoa down.

868
00:37:26,071 --> 00:37:26,840
Yeah,
this gay.

869
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,510
Yeah.
Yeah.

870
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,100
This has to stop.
Yeah.

871
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:32,520
He was like fucking sword up in his
warehouse.

872
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:35,640
That is not happening.
I don't think he called him a faggot.

873
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,210
I think I made that up.
I literally barely remember because I

874
00:37:39,211 --> 00:37:41,730
was 13.
I do remember him saying that though,

875
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:44,310
that there could be no love without sex
because I remember like,

876
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:47,550
what?
That's crazy what a gateway line to

877
00:37:47,551 --> 00:37:48,750
dude,
if you're a pedophile,

878
00:37:48,751 --> 00:37:51,840
like I'm glad I don't have that,
that element,

879
00:37:51,841 --> 00:37:53,880
man.
It's got to be so tough to be,

880
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,280
you know,
hanging around kids and also like,

881
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:57,810
you know,
want to like,

882
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,290
you know,
talk to them about dates or stuff.

883
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:03,210
What's the incurable one?
Two.

884
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,940
There is no cure for that.
Like the.

885
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:09,020
I mean,
unless they can rewire your brain,

886
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:13,590
your brain with Iowasca and Ibogaine
electric shock therapy.

887
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:18,270
I don't know.
The recidivism rate is super high for

888
00:38:18,271 --> 00:38:20,070
people that are child molesters.
What does that mean?

889
00:38:20,071 --> 00:38:22,070
People that do it again,
man,

890
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,870
you know,
it's really high when kids are.

891
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,030
It's also something you can't even talk
about.

892
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:30,210
Like say,
imagine if you have like a mental

893
00:38:30,211 --> 00:38:34,710
illness that makes you prone to violent
outbursts,

894
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,040
but you got it under control and

895
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,980
you never actually hurt anybody.
You know,

896
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,660
you never actually heard anybody but you
understand you have this problem.

897
00:38:40,661 --> 00:38:42,570
So you take medication and people go
good for you.

898
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,140
You know,
I go to therapy,

899
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,630
I have anger management issues,
but I go to therapy.

900
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:47,411
People are like,
oh,

901
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:48,520
that's cool man.
Cool.

902
00:38:48,521 --> 00:38:51,340
You keep it under wraps.
But if you say I want to fuck kids,

903
00:38:51,341 --> 00:38:53,800
but I never have.
Yeah,

904
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,240
no way.
No way,

905
00:38:55,241 --> 00:38:56,530
dude,
everybody wants to put a bullet in your

906
00:38:56,531 --> 00:38:59,200
brain that you can't work here.
You can't shop here.

907
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,050
I don't do it,
but I want to know like what?

908
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,540
What you want to.
Yeah,

909
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:07,060
but I don't do it because I know it's
wrong or not good enough.

910
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,210
That's not going to fly.
Not good enough because we all want to

911
00:39:10,211 --> 00:39:11,530
have kids and like are,
you know,

912
00:39:11,531 --> 00:39:12,850
we all want to procreate in that.

913
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,700
Really.
I think that that just,

914
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,280
that's gonna irk.
Anybody that wants scares people.

915
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,990
Yeah.
It's the scariest thing ever.

916
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:23,110
The thing that you could leave your kids
out and someone could snatch them up and

917
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:26,290
fuck them and kill them and they kill
them a lot of times because they don't

918
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:29,280
want the kids to tell.
And a dark,

919
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,110
dark,
worse man and then.

920
00:39:32,111 --> 00:39:34,090
Yeah,
I can't imagine that.

921
00:39:34,091 --> 00:39:36,340
Dude.
I remember one time I never had anything

922
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:38,790
like that happened about.
I took some mushrooms one time to a,

923
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:43,600
a party in high school because I grew up
in an area where you could just get

924
00:39:43,601 --> 00:39:45,550
mushrooms.
Psychedelic mushrooms grew on

925
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:47,620
everything.
They grow on your fucking cousins back.

926
00:39:47,621 --> 00:39:50,560
If he took a long enough nap and you can
pitch,

927
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:54,370
you grow up in Louisiana,
grew everywhere out there because

928
00:39:54,371 --> 00:39:57,040
everybody had something shitting in
their yard and then it would rain every

929
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:58,420
single day for about a half hour.

930
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,100
Right.
So it was just.

931
00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:01,840
I mean,
you see people picking them and eating

932
00:40:01,841 --> 00:40:04,630
them and families out there and join
them in the afternoon.

933
00:40:04,631 --> 00:40:05,800
I mean it was.
Everybody was,

934
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,570
oh,
it was psychedelic heaven.

935
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:11,350
So we would ride out and go get them.
I remember one time getting a trash bag

936
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,600
of probably about 35 pounds of
mushrooms.

937
00:40:13,601 --> 00:40:17,410
Right?
So we picked all day and one time a

938
00:40:17,411 --> 00:40:20,140
golden retriever came running at us
across this field and we thought he was

939
00:40:20,141 --> 00:40:21,970
pissed because we were tripping and then
he got to us.

940
00:40:21,971 --> 00:40:25,870
We ran for like a half mile.
He got to is oddly,

941
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:30,320
we're crawling away from thinking he's
evil and he fucking loved us and licked

942
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:34,540
mean golden retriever.
We thought he was mean bras because the

943
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:36,220
hair,
his hair was kind of slicked back.

944
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,350
Oh look,
an evil golden retriever.

945
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,081
Yeah.
Like in that movie,

946
00:40:39,081 --> 00:40:40,060
sometimes they come back.

947
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,620
Have you ever seen that,
that Stephen King movie,

948
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,340
it was kind of like that kind of hair,
pet cemetery?

949
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,020
Which ones?
Sometimes they come back.

950
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:48,680
The Nea?
No,

951
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,610
it's about men that show up back at a
high school and they all died years

952
00:40:51,611 --> 00:40:53,470
earlier in a car accident and they show
back up.

953
00:40:53,471 --> 00:40:55,960
It's like a Stephen King when I think it
was just made for TV.

954
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:59,020
When did that one come out?
It may be 18 years ago.

955
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:04,000
Has there ever been a dude who wrote
more awesome horror movies and books and

956
00:41:04,001 --> 00:41:06,260
Steven fucking King?
No.

957
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,380
No.
Not that published them.

958
00:41:08,381 --> 00:41:09,940
Unless somebody just has them all at
their house.

959
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:12,160
Sometimes they come back,
hit me.

960
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,760
He's the king of those kinds of movies,
man.

961
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,590
Yeah.
Not even close.

962
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,410
Tim,
what's his name was Tim Matheson,

963
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,090
who I interviewed one time.
Really Nice man.

964
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,800
You did?
What'd you interview him for?

965
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,740
He had a new movie coming out.
I can't remember.

966
00:41:26,741 --> 00:41:30,010
It was called,
but sweet man.

967
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:32,140
I bet he got a lot of posts over the
years,

968
00:41:32,141 --> 00:41:32,974
but he didn't talk about

969
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,650
because he's got that safe man.
Look safe,

970
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:38,300
man.
Look,

971
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,710
I think a lot of ladies.
Oh yeah,

972
00:41:39,711 --> 00:41:41,870
he's got that.
He's got that kind of sexy,

973
00:41:41,871 --> 00:41:46,190
but also safe that Matt Lauer look.
Yeah,

974
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,710
yeah.
Maybe it's got that mailer.

975
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,540
You think about Lauer's dirty.
What was definitely dirty.

976
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,340
See he's got that cheap Michael Land and
he's got that cheap.

977
00:41:55,341 --> 00:41:57,740
Michael Landon going right there.
It looks like it could be a little bit

978
00:41:57,741 --> 00:42:00,120
of native American.
Looks like a generous right there.

979
00:42:00,121 --> 00:42:01,190
It looks like a little bit of guys went
up.

980
00:42:01,191 --> 00:42:05,690
A little bit of lesbian and this one too
generous with the smile.

981
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,640
There's the animal house picture above
it.

982
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:09,410
Oh Man.
How good was he?

983
00:42:09,411 --> 00:42:10,530
An animal house.
So good.

984
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:14,120
What a movie that was.
I watched that again a few years back.

985
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,260
I hadn't seen in forever.
Fuck.

986
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,860
That was a good movie,
but there's some shit in that movie you

987
00:42:18,861 --> 00:42:21,200
could never get away with today.

988
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:24,920
Now never.
There's a scene where the girl's passed

989
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:29,921
out and whose car was it?
John Balloon knows whose character was

990
00:42:30,501 --> 00:42:33,350
thinking about fucking her while she was
blacked out.

991
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,480
You remember that scene?
There's a scene in it.

992
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:39,680
Yeah.
The girl,

993
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:41,870
she takes her gum off,
she pulls her bra.

994
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,780
Who is that guy?
Why don't you get them in their mouth or

995
00:42:45,781 --> 00:42:48,350
they're about to fuck you ever notice
that they don't want bad breath.

996
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:49,221
Yeah.
So,

997
00:42:49,221 --> 00:42:51,080
uh,
there's a devil on his shoulder and then

998
00:42:51,081 --> 00:42:53,900
the angels on his other soul,
she blacks out with their titties out

999
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,490
and the devil is like,
fucker,

1000
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:59,030
fuck her fucker fucking brains out.
And then the angels like,

1001
00:42:59,031 --> 00:43:00,590
don't do it,
don't do it.

1002
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:05,090
But the fact that this is in a movie
where they're essentially debating

1003
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:09,530
whether or not he should rape her now
she was willing to have sex with them

1004
00:43:09,531 --> 00:43:10,340
just moments ago.

1005
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:14,420
But she's clearly unconscious and
clearly not able to consent.

1006
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:15,650
I mean,
she was black.

1007
00:43:15,651 --> 00:43:16,590
The fuck out.
She,

1008
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:21,130
she was totally down for it.
So he's holding onto cotton that was in

1009
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:26,120
her bra and she just blacked out and
fell asleep.

1010
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,013
Cup,
bonk.

1011
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:29,780
And he's popped out.
You would never have this scene in a

1012
00:43:29,781 --> 00:43:32,090
movie today.
People would be outraged.

1013
00:43:32,091 --> 00:43:34,640
They would,
they would say the direct you are Roman

1014
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,473
Polanski,
piece of shit.

1015
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:38,570
You're a fucking molester.
You're a monster,

1016
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:40,120
you're an abuser.
Yeah,

1017
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:42,650
but do you think that still.
That still happens though?

1018
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,900
Well,
that kind of thing definitely happens

1019
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,490
for sure.
People do all murder.

1020
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,130
Murder still happens.
I remember there was a school shooting

1021
00:43:49,131 --> 00:43:51,410
today in Texas.
I mean horrible things happen,

1022
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:54,380
but the point is like that kind of scene
in the movie,

1023
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,900
in a comedy movie you could never do
today,

1024
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:00,680
but they say that our code,
so that makes me think like they say art

1025
00:44:00,681 --> 00:44:03,830
imitates life,
but if it doesn't really imitate life

1026
00:44:03,831 --> 00:44:07,400
anymore than it's just
are we are we,

1027
00:44:07,401 --> 00:44:08,250
you know,
it just.

1028
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:09,920
Yeah,
like what are we making?

1029
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,740
The thing is that in a comedy and that's
the,

1030
00:44:13,741 --> 00:44:16,250
the lead of the story or one of the
heroes of the story,

1031
00:44:16,251 --> 00:44:19,700
that guy in that scene,
you would not want the hero of the story

1032
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:22,970
to do something so horrific and
something that you can laugh at because

1033
00:44:22,971 --> 00:44:25,940
you would have to be judging him by his
crime and we all agree that that's a

1034
00:44:25,941 --> 00:44:29,180
crime.
Now what is this I see from meatballs.

1035
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:32,790
What does this have to do with as it
gets to in here?

1036
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:35,040
Bill Murray starts doing the same kind
of thing with the girl.

1037
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:36,690
Oh,
that's a girl.

1038
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:39,030
Oh.
Oh.

1039
00:44:39,031 --> 00:44:42,750
He's trying to rape her while he's
trying to be sexually aggressive.

1040
00:44:42,751 --> 00:44:44,670
Is that what it is?
We're wrestling around being sexually

1041
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,720
aggressive.
Is the new.

1042
00:44:45,721 --> 00:44:47,910
Is that thing?
He was throwing himself at her and she

1043
00:44:47,911 --> 00:44:48,744
got out of the way.

1044
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,500
Even jerk off.
I.

1045
00:44:50,501 --> 00:44:52,500
I drive out to Riverside to jerk off,
man,

1046
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:56,340
you can't even jerk off in la anymore
without having a lawyer on retainer.

1047
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,720
But nuts are on contingency.
I felt like.

1048
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:05,580
I just feel like it's so dang injuries.
You imagine if it turns out that you're

1049
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:09,930
some sort of a sex criminal for jerking
off to a certain type of thing.

1050
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:13,470
Like what if you're into.
What do they find out?

1051
00:45:13,471 --> 00:45:17,850
You're into girls getting tied up,
jerk off to videos of girls getting tied

1052
00:45:17,851 --> 00:45:21,900
up and fucked like what kind of tied up
like scary or like again,

1053
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:24,140
like snm shit.
Just.

1054
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:27,030
It was just like my scouts of America
type of shit.

1055
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,910
I was reading this thing about this guy
who got arrested for child porn.

1056
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,730
They wanted them for something else.
They caught him and arrested him for

1057
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:37,140
child porn and like there's also some
suspicion attached to it accusations,

1058
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:41,640
but all you have to have is have child
porn.

1059
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,000
You don't have to be a child molester,
you just have to have the images and

1060
00:45:47,131 --> 00:45:51,210
you're a bad guy and you're the worst.
You're going to jail like it's one of

1061
00:45:51,211 --> 00:45:54,660
the few things you could have on your
laptop.

1062
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,280
They can come over your house,
your house.

1063
00:45:56,490 --> 00:46:00,630
They checked feel Vaughn's laptop and
there's 100 videos from Isis and then

1064
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,620
and chopping heads off with dull knives,
stabbing them.

1065
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,490
The next shooting,
I'm lighting them on fire.

1066
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:10,970
Nothing happens to nothing.
One video of a kid that looks under age

1067
00:46:13,501 --> 00:46:16,140
getting fucked and you're going to jail,
just a video,

1068
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:20,100
not you doing anything but you being in
possession of that kind of crime.

1069
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:23,160
So we,
we make big differentiations,

1070
00:46:23,161 --> 00:46:25,350
right?
We've really clearly differentiate

1071
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,880
between some crimes that you can have on
your computer in a video form like

1072
00:46:29,881 --> 00:46:32,910
murder,
which you could download on live leak or

1073
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:34,500
100 different websites.

1074
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,960
Right?
You can get videos of people getting

1075
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:37,771
murdered.
Yeah,

1076
00:46:37,771 --> 00:46:39,630
and you can watch it almost every night
on television,

1077
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:43,320
like in a kind of specially packaged way
where it's really is about the murder,

1078
00:46:43,321 --> 00:46:44,250
but it's not,
you know,

1079
00:46:44,251 --> 00:46:45,840
and all these shows.
The fake stuff.

1080
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:47,100
Yeah.
You watched fake stuff.

1081
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:49,440
I mean you can definitely,
definitely watch fake rape.

1082
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:54,980
Rape and movies were horrific scenes,
but if you have that on your computer

1083
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:58,170
and it's child porn,
you are going to jail.

1084
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,560
It's one of the only things would if
it's drawings of that.

1085
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,440
That's a good question.
There's a,

1086
00:47:03,441 --> 00:47:06,750
there's a real debate about that because
because there's naked children in the 18

1087
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,100
hundreds,
they had all these paintings of naked

1088
00:47:08,101 --> 00:47:12,360
children dancing in the fucking woods in
the sky and will remember those guys,

1089
00:47:12,361 --> 00:47:14,370
but balloons.
But that's different because it was

1090
00:47:14,371 --> 00:47:16,800
naked.
Children weren't being portrayed in a

1091
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:17,670
sexual way.

1092
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,130
They were just free.
They just didn't have any clothes on.

1093
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,720
You know what I mean?
No one was fucking.

1094
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:25,080
But you're telling me that a guy likes
kid isn't looking at those naked kids

1095
00:47:25,081 --> 00:47:28,350
with the flute and thinking wildness.
Well he can think wildness,

1096
00:47:28,351 --> 00:47:32,650
but it's not being specifically designed
to excite.

1097
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,030
I see what you're saying.
Rouse you.

1098
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:37,570
Whereas pornography with children is,
you know,

1099
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:42,720
like there is a debate about what is the
rule about animated child pornography

1100
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:49,000
because I think.
But I think that it's illegal as well,

1101
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:50,560
but it shit.
Yeah.

1102
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,630
You don't want to google it was supposed
to google.

1103
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,690
That's a good jv partner goes to jail.

1104
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,480
He's the fall guy to jail.
All the thoughts.

1105
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:06,170
You think it is laptop,
they go to her.

1106
00:48:06,171 --> 00:48:07,750
No,
I worked for Joe Rogan.

1107
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,950
Joe was like,
I was just brainstorm.

1108
00:48:09,951 --> 00:48:13,750
I'm just spit balling ideas folks.
I'm part of the American dream or this

1109
00:48:13,751 --> 00:48:16,630
away after that that we need to take
that in the fucking back.

1110
00:48:16,631 --> 00:48:21,631
I'll shoot it with arrows.
Do they get scared?

1111
00:48:21,731 --> 00:48:23,620
I used to be on drugs sometimes.
You know,

1112
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,040
you get on the Internet and you're not
looking at anything super crazy,

1113
00:48:27,041 --> 00:48:28,210
but you're like,
you know,

1114
00:48:28,211 --> 00:48:31,890
you wonder if like pornography sites or
when they say team like it's.

1115
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,890
That stuff gets so dark man.
If he didn't usually look for team.

1116
00:48:35,891 --> 00:48:37,720
Like what does team mean?
You know,

1117
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:40,170
it's just scary teen.
Yeah.

1118
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,520
Like there's a,
there's a five year gap.

1119
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:46,750
13 is crazy illegal,
horrible darkness.

1120
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:48,600
18 is like,
Ooh,

1121
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:50,590
just made it under the wire.
Yeah,

1122
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:53,020
just under the wire.
Seventeens illegal.

1123
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:55,900
Sixteens illegal.
Fifteens really illegal.

1124
00:48:55,901 --> 00:49:00,640
14 is super illegal.
13 is fucking crazy illegal today.

1125
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:05,880
Twelve is you're a monster,
you're a monster if you're 12 show hot

1126
00:49:06,641 --> 00:49:08,470
ones,
but for like chop children,

1127
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:09,580
you know,
have you ever seen that show with her

1128
00:49:09,581 --> 00:49:11,710
eating the hot wings and it gets hotter
and hotter and hotter.

1129
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:19,210
You guys remember when Traci Lords came
out and said she did all her porn before

1130
00:49:19,211 --> 00:49:23,980
the age of 18?
TRACI lords was like one of the hottest

1131
00:49:23,981 --> 00:49:28,120
porn stars of all time.
I met her and I had her.

1132
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:30,970
I hosted a television show and she was
one of the guests.

1133
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:36,480
It was a show on vh one called the list
and I'm Rick James was on it.

1134
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:41,740
Rob Halford from Judas priest was on it.
Meatloaf was on it,

1135
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:43,630
who I talked to a lot of people on that
show.

1136
00:49:43,631 --> 00:49:46,540
I did a whole week,
a whole week of episodes way back in the

1137
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:47,370
day.
Fun.

1138
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:48,203
Yeah,
it was fun.

1139
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:49,570
Um,
but anyway,

1140
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:54,280
traci lords,
when she was like 16,

1141
00:49:54,281 --> 00:49:57,220
became like the biggest porn star in the
world and they let her do it.

1142
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:01,840
I think she lied.
She lied about her age and then she only

1143
00:50:01,841 --> 00:50:06,250
did one porn film when she was 18.
It's the only one that you can get now.

1144
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,840
Just one when she became legal.
Do you?

1145
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,540
Uh,
I bet somebody had that's illegal.

1146
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:17,290
Get rid of that.
Traci lords bottom was rear view.

1147
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,730
Get that out of there.
That's an,

1148
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:21,000
that's an illegal photo.
So I'm sick.

1149
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:25,720
There's a lot of those photos of her
online or illegal because like you could

1150
00:50:25,721 --> 00:50:27,860
still find the illegal.
It's just

1151
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,700
they didn't label it,
you know,

1152
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:34,130
but every,
there was like one video she did when

1153
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:38,120
she was 18 and the only one I try to
stay off of pornography,

1154
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:40,640
man,
that's one of my biggest arch nemesis is

1155
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:42,780
pornography.
Why?

1156
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:45,470
Because it just weakens me.
It just.

1157
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,460
Yeah.
How so?

1158
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:50,690
I put all my sexual
fantasies and stuff.

1159
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,150
They're not mine anymore,
you know,

1160
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:55,160
they live,
you know,

1161
00:50:55,161 --> 00:50:59,030
somebody created a better than my
imagination can and so they live in

1162
00:50:59,031 --> 00:50:59,661
these,
you know,

1163
00:50:59,661 --> 00:51:01,700
on the Internet and these boxes and it's
like,

1164
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:06,500
and if it's not mine I think then it's,
I don't value it as much or something.

1165
00:51:06,501 --> 00:51:11,270
And so I think it had like weakens my
ability to be able to have sex and like

1166
00:51:11,271 --> 00:51:14,660
be comfortable in that sort of world and
oh yeah.

1167
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:18,080
Weakens your ability to be comfortable.
Like how so?

1168
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:24,010
Well,
because I get used to watching the sex

1169
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:29,860
and seeing it
and not having to like be engaged with

1170
00:51:31,281 --> 00:51:32,630
my actual feelings or anything.

1171
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:36,440
So then I see it and I still get all the
joys out of it,

1172
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:37,550
you know,
I'm still out there,

1173
00:51:37,551 --> 00:51:41,180
eat jack in and spray spraying out
naturally,

1174
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,400
but it's,
I don't get it.

1175
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:44,900
I don't have any of the feelings
attached to it.

1176
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:47,840
So then when I am engaging with somebody
that I care about or something,

1177
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:52,220
it just doesn't calculate for me
emotionally as well.

1178
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:54,110
Um,
and that's not,

1179
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,900
maybe that's just me.
Uh,

1180
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:57,740
but it does.
It's definitely made it tougher for me

1181
00:51:57,741 --> 00:52:02,741
over the years because I would have a
date set up with a nice girl and next

1182
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:04,820
thing you know,
I'm walking through the house and I

1183
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:06,770
start thinking about,
you know,

1184
00:52:06,771 --> 00:52:10,610
a little bit of c or something and then
some tips or something or I'll even see

1185
00:52:10,611 --> 00:52:13,670
a fucking.
I'll see a pregnant puppy and see those

1186
00:52:13,671 --> 00:52:14,900
nipples or something.
Next thing you know,

1187
00:52:14,901 --> 00:52:16,850
you're on the Internet jerking off and
then you wait a minute,

1188
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:17,650
hold on.

1189
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:18,730
Or like,
you know what I'm saying?

1190
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:21,970
Anything,
anything would lead them in Jack off of

1191
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,520
pregnant puppy could make you think
about human nipples.

1192
00:52:25,521 --> 00:52:28,400
Is that what you're saying?
And you're not getting excited about the

1193
00:52:28,401 --> 00:52:29,390
puppy?
No,

1194
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:30,410
no.
I will do anything.

1195
00:52:30,411 --> 00:52:31,820
I don't.
I don't believe in beastiality or

1196
00:52:31,821 --> 00:52:35,280
anything like that,
but I think if you don't believe it

1197
00:52:35,281 --> 00:52:37,280
exists,
it exists.

1198
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,970
They caught a dude near me one time with
a lamb.

1199
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:43,700
No.
Which almost sounds beautiful when you

1200
00:52:43,701 --> 00:52:45,290
just say it.
Yeah.

1201
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,120
The lines lay with the lambs.
Yeah.

1202
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,340
But I don't think.
When you say near you,

1203
00:52:50,341 --> 00:52:52,340
you mean in Hollywood?
No,

1204
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:52,910
no,
no.

1205
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:54,530
You mean when you were a kid in
Louisiana,

1206
00:52:55,800 --> 00:53:00,090
they got a lot of people out there on
those fucking natural born mushrooms.

1207
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:03,050
Oh,
I never told you to the end of that.

1208
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:03,680
Oh,
sorry.

1209
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,500
So no,
I took that back to that party and a

1210
00:53:06,501 --> 00:53:09,050
bunch of people ate a mood.
Never had them before.

1211
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,510
And then we played a game of hide and go
seek.

1212
00:53:11,511 --> 00:53:12,344
Right?
I was like,

1213
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,960
yeah,
hide in another dimension.

1214
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:19,040
I'll count you guys go hide.
Right.

1215
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,840
And I never went to fucking look for it.

1216
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,500
That ahead,
bro.

1217
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:29,520
I never seen one dude,
tim at the.

1218
00:53:29,521 --> 00:53:34,200
I never seen that dude again.
People get lost in the woods,

1219
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,400
man.
Maybe they got eaten.

1220
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,560
Oh yeah.
Maybe they ended up in another realm.

1221
00:53:37,561 --> 00:53:40,110
You could have like stranger things.
Yeah.

1222
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:41,250
See that show.
Oh yeah.

1223
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:43,350
The first season I saw a phenomenal
show,

1224
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:45,620
but I don't like that pornography.
Oh.

1225
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:47,520
And I think it's.
I think it should be shut down,

1226
00:53:47,521 --> 00:53:48,420
man.
For Real.

1227
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:51,780
Yeah.
Because I think it's killing like a lot

1228
00:53:51,781 --> 00:53:52,590
of.
I think it's.

1229
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:54,360
I think it's harming a lot of men and I
really,

1230
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:56,430
really do.
Do you think that booze should be shut

1231
00:53:56,431 --> 00:53:58,830
down?
Should we make booze illegal?

1232
00:53:58,831 --> 00:54:00,780
Because that's killing a lot of men to
know,

1233
00:54:00,781 --> 00:54:04,200
but I think eventually will kind of
evolve out of booze is it's not like

1234
00:54:04,201 --> 00:54:09,060
something that it's not the hip a drug
that it once was.

1235
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,330
Yeah,
but it's still like a social lubricant.

1236
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:13,490
That's a good point.
You know,

1237
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:17,250
it makes people feel more comfortable
talking to each other,

1238
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:20,190
loosens inhibitions.
It's fun.

1239
00:54:20,191 --> 00:54:23,540
Like,
what is that ancient quote about wind?

1240
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,310
No,
your tongue becoming more lively.

1241
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:30,890
People love wine and women love one too.
Especially divorce says if you see them.

1242
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:31,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

1243
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:33,930
Like one.
I used to live with these rich people

1244
00:54:33,931 --> 00:54:38,931
for awhile and they always had one boy.
Why didn't divorce ses like one?

1245
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:40,610
I don't know,
but when,

1246
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:42,150
when one of her friends would get
divorced,

1247
00:54:42,151 --> 00:54:45,600
they'd come over and just drink wine and
they lay on the couch when I'm trying to

1248
00:54:45,601 --> 00:54:50,280
hook up with you on the trampoline.
And I remember dad used to masturbate at

1249
00:54:50,281 --> 00:54:52,710
night over there.
This when speaking to pornography,

1250
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:56,550
the dad used to masturbate at night and
I would sneak out there in the kitchen.

1251
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:58,560
This back when the family,
he had like a family computer,

1252
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:00,270
you know,
it was in one part of the house.

1253
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:02,730
Right.
And I try to sneak to the fridgerator

1254
00:55:02,731 --> 00:55:05,340
and get some chips or something or get
something.

1255
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,540
I lives or something and he would uh,
be over there by himself.

1256
00:55:09,541 --> 00:55:12,750
Just in the fucking no,
just where you can't even hear.

1257
00:55:12,751 --> 00:55:15,570
You're so intent on the screen.
You can't even fucking hear.

1258
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:18,170
You could have your grandparents on each
side of your head.

1259
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:19,650
You caught them.
Oh,

1260
00:55:19,651 --> 00:55:21,480
I'd say him.
I wouldn't watch for long,

1261
00:55:21,481 --> 00:55:24,060
but I went through the window.
No,

1262
00:55:24,061 --> 00:55:26,880
I'd sneak out to the kitchen because the
computer was kind of in the kitchen.

1263
00:55:26,881 --> 00:55:30,690
They had a nice house and the computer,
I'd have to elbow crawl over to the

1264
00:55:30,691 --> 00:55:32,360
fridge,
Bro.

1265
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:35,670
I would have to open the fridge a little
reach in with my hand and press that

1266
00:55:35,671 --> 00:55:38,880
light thing so the light wouldn't come
on and then open the door the rest of

1267
00:55:38,881 --> 00:55:42,840
the way of fish for a snack and he's
over there just in the glow of that

1268
00:55:42,841 --> 00:55:43,530
screen,
Bro.

1269
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:45,630
And that's back when the monitors were
big,

1270
00:55:45,631 --> 00:55:47,520
you know,
and he's just over there just fucking

1271
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:52,020
looking for the devil.
And he ended up getting divorced and it

1272
00:55:52,021 --> 00:55:53,670
was,
I think a lot of it was because of that.

1273
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,440
What,
what was his wife like?

1274
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:57,150
She wonderful,
sweet woman.

1275
00:55:57,350 --> 00:56:00,540
I wish she annoying.
I think she might've been a little bit

1276
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,700
annoying.
Business centric sometimes business

1277
00:56:03,701 --> 00:56:05,340
centric.
A little too much.

1278
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:09,000
Just so yeah,
maybe just to business centric.

1279
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:12,810
What does that mean to you?
She might have been a little too

1280
00:56:12,811 --> 00:56:15,900
demanding,
but then if he's up for an hour and a

1281
00:56:15,901 --> 00:56:18,390
half each night out there,
you know,

1282
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:22,320
looking at it all and he comes back to
the bedroom.

1283
00:56:22,321 --> 00:56:23,680
Then you don't feel as desirable.

1284
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:26,260
Direction is what came first.
The chicken or the egg.

1285
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,260
For what?
For them?

1286
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:34,030
Was she annoying first and he started
beating off or was he had it and he beat

1287
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:37,720
the devil?
I think he had a pit of it in him.

1288
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:43,180
I could see it in his eyes.
He was talking to me just hoping I'd go

1289
00:56:43,181 --> 00:56:46,120
to sleep.
He would drag me but not to have sex

1290
00:56:46,121 --> 00:56:48,340
with me.
He drugged me so that he could freely

1291
00:56:48,341 --> 00:56:50,740
masturbate.
He leave his socks on.

1292
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:53,470
He wouldn't even take his pants off.
He's put a hat on.

1293
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:56,970
He was in.
The worst is if you're jerking off with

1294
00:56:56,971 --> 00:56:57,880
a hat on,
bro,

1295
00:56:58,390 --> 00:56:59,470
you're going to hell.
I think

1296
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,850
that's the most French thing.
You can do it.

1297
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:06,150
Jack Williams truck,
Kentucky Derby Hat.

1298
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:14,170
What's the worst hat to jack or worst
job at top hat because you have to

1299
00:57:14,921 --> 00:57:18,460
balance yourself while I'm fucking
chimney.

1300
00:57:18,461 --> 00:57:23,461
Sweep
the best one of those Chinese Hasbro

1301
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:27,460
because if you squat down low enough to
the ground,

1302
00:57:27,461 --> 00:57:29,010
you can almost hide under it and you're
like all

1303
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,120
the things that'd be dope,
Bro.

1304
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:36,070
The most confusing it would be like one
of them,

1305
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:37,420
Daniel Boone.
Raccoon

1306
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,150
tail.
You pushed it.

1307
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:47,530
You blow into details in the way.
Scare the fuck out of my way with its

1308
00:57:47,531 --> 00:57:49,960
tail,
right about the finish.

1309
00:57:49,961 --> 00:57:51,370
You get distracted but it tail

1310
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:03,290
choking up dusty
and it's hard to ejaculate and you're

1311
00:58:03,991 --> 00:58:06,120
breathing out real fast.
Yeah.

1312
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:08,850
It's more of an issue.
It's more of a intake sport.

1313
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:12,330
Yeah.
But I don't like him.

1314
00:58:12,331 --> 00:58:15,290
And you think it's healthy for people
because I feel like you kinda like,

1315
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,580
you know,
you lead lead a lot of men and like

1316
00:58:17,581 --> 00:58:21,980
their aspirations to control their
beings and stuff and these,

1317
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:24,270
just some of my weird interpretations,
but you know,

1318
00:58:24,271 --> 00:58:27,300
to try and be on top of themselves in
some ways and you know,

1319
00:58:27,301 --> 00:58:29,700
stay focused on,
on,

1320
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,680
on controlling themselves in positive
ways,

1321
00:58:34,681 --> 00:58:36,930
you know,
like staying fit and expanding their

1322
00:58:36,931 --> 00:58:38,130
minds and thinking,
you know,

1323
00:58:38,131 --> 00:58:40,890
and not falling into easy traps.
Having discipline.

1324
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:42,890
That's what I'm trying to say.
Yes.

1325
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:46,950
I think that
it's definitely important to have

1326
00:58:46,951 --> 00:58:50,490
discipline,
but I think that if you're a person like

1327
00:58:50,491 --> 00:58:53,100
say if you're not in a relationship,
you're not getting any sex and you're

1328
00:58:53,101 --> 00:58:56,760
horny and it's confusing and it's
distracting and it becomes a big

1329
00:58:56,761 --> 00:58:57,594
distraction.

1330
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:01,170
Like if you're.
If you're horny and you're busy and you

1331
00:59:01,171 --> 00:59:04,020
don't have anybody you're dating,
you don't want to hook up with someone

1332
00:59:04,021 --> 00:59:06,030
you don't like just so you could have
sex with them.

1333
00:59:06,031 --> 00:59:07,230
We've all been there before,
right?

1334
00:59:07,231 --> 00:59:09,810
Yeah.
If you ever had girls that you were

1335
00:59:09,811 --> 00:59:12,970
friends with or you dated and the only
reason why I dated him for,

1336
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:16,140
for the sex and they did annoy the shit
out of you and you couldn't wait to get

1337
00:59:16,141 --> 00:59:18,840
the fuck away from them to tiffany's.
This girl I'm thinking about.

1338
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:23,900
Tell me about tiffany.
She had kind of like too much.

1339
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,890
I don't want to say sideburns,
but she had a lot of,

1340
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:30,740
you know,
you don't know how to ride them.

1341
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:31,880
Oh,
they were little.

1342
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:33,410
They went down the cheek.
We're good.

1343
00:59:33,411 --> 00:59:35,630
Confusing.
Did an extra quarter inch on a female

1344
00:59:35,631 --> 00:59:37,100
sideburn is way too much law.

1345
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:39,220
It is an extra quarter into the lot.
Yeah.

1346
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:43,250
Yeah.
It makes you think about and if she cuts

1347
00:59:43,251 --> 00:59:44,660
it you're like,
well if you let it go,

1348
00:59:44,661 --> 00:59:48,290
what would happen?
So she's really hit or miss reigns on

1349
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:51,140
that side hair.
And so yeah,

1350
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:53,690
she had some family issues but yeah,
that's what I was thinking about what

1351
00:59:53,691 --> 00:59:55,190
you're saying that I interrupted.
You know,

1352
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:59,030
everybody guys have that before.
Most likely in some guy's mind up

1353
00:59:59,031 --> 01:00:01,010
marrying those girls because they don't
want to be alone.

1354
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:05,210
Like sex for a lot of people is a
requirement.

1355
01:00:05,211 --> 01:00:10,211
Like a physical biological requirement.
Like your body is constantly producing

1356
01:00:10,401 --> 01:00:12,380
sperm.
You need sex.

1357
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,800
If you spend time not having sex,
you spend a month,

1358
01:00:15,801 --> 01:00:16,730
two months,
three months,

1359
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:18,700
you get fucking desperate.
Yeah.

1360
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:23,330
And a lot of guys wind up just shacking
up with some gal just because they know

1361
01:00:23,331 --> 01:00:25,670
they to have sex with her and meanwhile
they don't even like each other and they

1362
01:00:25,671 --> 01:00:27,740
hate each other and he wants to be a
terrible,

1363
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:28,940
dysfunctional relationship.

1364
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:31,670
But she's basically your drug dealer.
That drug is pussy.

1365
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:33,830
Wow.
She's dealing with that pussy for you.

1366
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:35,870
And you just got to have this weird,
creepy,

1367
01:00:35,871 --> 01:00:39,500
dysfunctional relationship with her.
One thing that pornography does.

1368
01:00:39,501 --> 01:00:41,750
It's good.
And I'm not saying all pornography,

1369
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:44,720
but just regular pornography,
like two guys,

1370
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:45,860
uh,
you know,

1371
01:00:45,861 --> 01:00:46,740
like,
uh,

1372
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:52,060
that are just living their lives were
like in like Chicago.

1373
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,140
I'm anywhere.
But I'm saying like,

1374
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,290
I'm giving you two separate scenarios to
guys that are living their lives.

1375
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,350
One guy says,
I can't take this anymore.

1376
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,060
I got to get a girl.
You know,

1377
01:01:02,061 --> 01:01:05,120
I got to get any girl.
And he winds up with this girl that

1378
01:01:05,121 --> 01:01:08,150
turns out to be a nightmare.
And she's a disaster.

1379
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:10,130
The devil,
it just doesn't work out.

1380
01:01:10,131 --> 01:01:11,540
And he's just doing it because he needs
sex.

1381
01:01:11,541 --> 01:01:13,850
And the other guy goes and says,
you know what?

1382
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:15,860
I'm just gonna Watch a little porn and
I'll beat off.

1383
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,140
I'll just look at that girl was big
taste like,

1384
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:20,720
Ooh,
I got it out of my system now I can

1385
01:01:20,721 --> 01:01:24,890
concentrate on my life and my career and
if I meet somebody I won't be so needy.

1386
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:28,430
I won't have this like massive
requirement to be sexually stimulated

1387
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,690
and touched.
I'll,

1388
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,800
I'll be free of that monkey on my back
and I can just get to know them.

1389
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:37,610
I used to always to have a bit in my
act.

1390
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,220
It's a good point.
I used to have a bit my act about like

1391
01:01:40,221 --> 01:01:42,230
if you ever have any critical decisions
in your life,

1392
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,360
this is my advice.
Jerk off first.

1393
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:46,610
Then think about it because there's been
many.

1394
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:49,790
I've had this happen in my life where I
was about to go on a date with a girl

1395
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:53,690
and I jerked off instead and I was like,
what am I thinking?

1396
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:56,030
I don't want to go on a date with her.
She's annoying.

1397
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:58,280
I don't like anything about her.
I don't.

1398
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:01,160
I can't talk to her about anything.
Like the only reason why I'm doing this

1399
01:02:01,161 --> 01:02:03,200
because she's got a big ass.
That's the only reason.

1400
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:05,150
Yeah.
But if you jerk off first,

1401
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:06,820
you don't.
You don't go through all that.

1402
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:09,010
Yeah,
I did.

1403
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:10,940
Yeah.
I guess for me it became addictive where

1404
01:02:10,941 --> 01:02:14,000
I would just do that every time and then
I was just at home for five years and

1405
01:02:14,001 --> 01:02:16,640
didn't go do any dates or anything.
It's definitely not good.

1406
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:17,560
Right.
And so that's.

1407
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:18,680
Yeah,
I guess that's the difference.

1408
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:22,110
If you get addicted to it and you find
that it's just a repeat pattern so

1409
01:02:22,111 --> 01:02:23,820
you're not spending time with people at
all.

1410
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:28,140
I don't think it's without value.
I don't think that looking at naked

1411
01:02:28,141 --> 01:02:30,420
people having sex which is arousing and
that feels good.

1412
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:34,230
I don't think that's without value,
but I think there's definitely a danger

1413
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:37,770
in immediate access to pornography and
today

1414
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:42,540
today it's the most immediate access
because you get it on your phone or you

1415
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:43,220
can get it.
Yeah.

1416
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:44,820
Let you pull up your laptop,
open it up,

1417
01:02:44,850 --> 01:02:47,430
type in some words you porn.com,
blah blah.

1418
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,020
And next thing you know you're beating
off.

1419
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:51,750
It's so easy.
This has never been the case before.

1420
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:54,420
I mean it's,
it's unlike any other time period in

1421
01:02:54,421 --> 01:02:58,470
human history and uh,
when you have instant access to things,

1422
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:00,750
you can abuse it just like people abused
food.

1423
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:06,260
If you have a cabinet that is filled
with candy and chips,

1424
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:09,810
chocolate bars,
soda in the frigerator,

1425
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,180
if you're just one of those people that
can't help themselves,

1426
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,390
you don't have any discipline,
you will just eat all that shit all day

1427
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:19,560
long and get fat and that is just as
much of an addiction as someone who has

1428
01:03:19,561 --> 01:03:20,880
access to porn all the time.

1429
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,790
It just beats off all the time.
Or someone who has access to booze and

1430
01:03:23,791 --> 01:03:28,791
just wants to get fucked up every day.
All those things are okay though in

1431
01:03:28,981 --> 01:03:30,930
moderation if you have discipline,
right?

1432
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:35,390
Like there's nothing wrong with having a
bag of m and m's every now and then for

1433
01:03:35,391 --> 01:03:37,160
a fucking.
I kind of feel like having some m and

1434
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:39,690
m's who gives a shit.
I work out all the time and eat my

1435
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:40,620
vegetables.
Peanut,

1436
01:03:40,621 --> 01:03:42,750
m and Ms. those are my favorite.
They're good,

1437
01:03:42,751 --> 01:03:44,040
Huh?
You kind of trick yourself.

1438
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:45,380
I'm getting a little protein.
Yeah,

1439
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:48,290
they put that trick in the minute.
Some healthy fats at that PDI,

1440
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:51,540
but I know a gun.
I'm saying.

1441
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:53,520
I just feel like we're.
We're at the point.

1442
01:03:53,521 --> 01:03:57,600
For me it seems like where the
temptation is too powerful,

1443
01:03:57,601 --> 01:04:02,601
where it starting to overpower whatever.
For me it was whatever my natural

1444
01:04:03,151 --> 01:04:04,820
abilities to defend against it work.

1445
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:05,541
Well,
you're sober,

1446
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:06,374
right?
Yeah.

1447
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:08,670
And how long have you been sober?
Almost two years.

1448
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,250
And so before you were sober you weren't
sober.

1449
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:13,200
Right?
And you had a little bit of a problem,

1450
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:17,130
which is why I became sober,
so you might have just natural

1451
01:04:17,131 --> 01:04:20,040
inclinations towards addiction,
which I definitely think are real and I

1452
01:04:20,041 --> 01:04:23,790
think they,
those natural inclinations exists a lot

1453
01:04:23,791 --> 01:04:26,640
of times and guys like you and me
because we're comedians,

1454
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:29,940
comedians are impulsive people who are
just rule breakers.

1455
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:33,660
We're rule breakers for sure.
Yeah,

1456
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:34,261
I guess.
Yeah,

1457
01:04:34,261 --> 01:04:36,900
I guess I am a rule breaker.
I never thought about that.

1458
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:38,940
The adult,
like a def.

1459
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:41,280
There's a rule of.
My first thing is to think of a way to

1460
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:44,210
think around that or something or to do
something different.

1461
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:45,670
It's while you're funny.
Yeah,

1462
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:47,400
it's one of the reasons it's one of
them.

1463
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:48,450
It's one of the reasons why you're
funny.

1464
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:52,940
You know,
like you were raised by people and you

1465
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:55,220
didn't necessarily want to listen to
them and you know,

1466
01:04:55,221 --> 01:04:57,510
you saw a bunch of other people in the
neighborhood that we're adults like

1467
01:04:57,540 --> 01:05:01,080
these fucking idiots telling me what to
do this and the next thing you know,

1468
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:03,630
you're making fun of them.
Next thing you know,

1469
01:05:03,631 --> 01:05:06,230
everybody's laughing.
Next thing you know you're a comedian in

1470
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:08,880
those.
Those wheels have been put into motion.

1471
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:12,420
Yeah know.
And the problem with that is that also

1472
01:05:12,421 --> 01:05:15,570
leads itself to you want to do coke,
are you wanting to,

1473
01:05:15,571 --> 01:05:17,160
you know,
do all kinds of crazy shit.

1474
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:18,003
And

1475
01:05:18,110 --> 01:05:22,540
to porns forbidden to porn is porn is
one of the weirder ones because it's

1476
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:25,200
this multibillion dollar thing,
right?

1477
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:31,020
Where there is some ungodly percentage
of the Internet is dedicated to porn.

1478
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:32,620
Yeah.
It's the number one money maker on

1479
01:05:32,621 --> 01:05:35,080
there,
but isn't it like what was the number,

1480
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,120
the amount of bandwidth,
Jamie,

1481
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:41,200
didn't we figure this out once?
It was like 30 something percent of all

1482
01:05:41,201 --> 01:05:45,130
the Internet bandwidth is porn.
Let's say a guest people won't stop

1483
01:05:45,131 --> 01:05:48,700
jerking off and they're not gonna stop.
I wonder how many of them are women

1484
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:51,370
watching it when?
If we had one day where nobody jerked

1485
01:05:51,371 --> 01:05:52,720
off.
If the earth would feel different,

1486
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:56,170
I feel lighter,
but it'd be more relaxed.

1487
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:58,510
No,
have one day where nobody jerked off on,

1488
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:00,760
but if nobody was thinking about it at
all,

1489
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:04,570
everybody would just calm down a little
because I feel like it's so prevalent

1490
01:06:04,571 --> 01:06:04,720
now.

1491
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,490
You can hear people coming in the
distance.

1492
01:06:06,491 --> 01:06:11,491
I feel like now it's your turn.
You're going to literally turn into a

1493
01:06:12,461 --> 01:06:17,461
book,
but that's an old fashioned jerking off.

1494
01:06:21,041 --> 01:06:24,280
We need you to let your balls hit your
hand straight up.

1495
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:28,960
A confederate soldier jerking off.
That's the jerk it off.

1496
01:06:28,961 --> 01:06:31,810
The new thing is just shaft only.
Nobody's fucking with their balls

1497
01:06:31,811 --> 01:06:33,060
anymore.
You know?

1498
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:34,420
Do.
When I was growing up,

1499
01:06:34,421 --> 01:06:36,190
we couldn't even get port.
We had to get this dude,

1500
01:06:36,191 --> 01:06:38,960
nick on Friday withdraws a pinterest and
pussy,

1501
01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:41,770
you know,
for the weekend for dollars to this

1502
01:06:41,771 --> 01:06:43,330
dude,
nick for dollars.

1503
01:06:43,331 --> 01:06:44,800
For drawings,
Bro.

1504
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:49,400
You'd pay eight and he had a nice
fucking thing bro.

1505
01:06:49,401 --> 01:06:52,510
When you would fold that thing up or you
could feel it heat and then your butt

1506
01:06:52,511 --> 01:06:55,180
pocket the whole way on the bus.
Sometimes you'd even slept good.

1507
01:06:55,181 --> 01:06:56,014
The pictures of that.

1508
01:06:56,350 --> 01:06:59,080
He was so drunk off this guy's drawing.
Oh everybody would.

1509
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:03,760
He must've made probably $60 on a Friday
and this was in 1995.

1510
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:06,280
You know,
that was $60 like 160 today.

1511
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:07,690
Oh yeah.
Think about that.

1512
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:10,030
I'm thinking about it.
Yeah Dude.

1513
01:07:10,031 --> 01:07:13,420
And we come back on Monday and people
would have like these fucking busted ass

1514
01:07:13,421 --> 01:07:16,510
looking all sketches reign on him.
He was like,

1515
01:07:16,511 --> 01:07:19,390
oh this is what got rained on it.
Like Bro,

1516
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:22,390
they had that rain is your fucking kids
and

1517
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:27,190
you're lying about that.
What percentage do you think of?

1518
01:07:27,191 --> 01:07:30,880
The Internet is dedicated to porn?
All Internet traffic,

1519
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:34,630
everything,
but I can't go on anything.

1520
01:07:34,631 --> 01:07:39,310
I looked at a chart of the 35 percent,
35 percent of the Internet traffic is

1521
01:07:39,311 --> 01:07:40,480
porn.
That's what I want to say.

1522
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:42,930
What do you want to say?
Yup.

1523
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:47,580
I would say that if you had to guess
that's high.

1524
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:49,120
I think think it's high.
Well,

1525
01:07:49,121 --> 01:07:50,790
it's easy for.
I'm going to go 30 because I'm gonna

1526
01:07:50,791 --> 01:07:54,820
play that undercard and I'm going to say
that 25 percent of that is but porn,

1527
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:57,750
but people looking at each side of each
other's butts.

1528
01:07:58,530 --> 01:08:00,250
I don't think we should get too
specific,

1529
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:03,370
but just porn porn itself.
What do we got Jamie?

1530
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:10,210
I found that multiple things that said
30 percent of all content on the

1531
01:08:10,791 --> 01:08:13,510
internet is just worn out.
But then I saw something else that it

1532
01:08:13,511 --> 01:08:16,020
was saying that that's completely,
but I

1533
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:20,600
found something here on this is 35
percent of all Internet downloads are

1534
01:08:20,601 --> 01:08:22,760
pornographic.
Thirty five percent.

1535
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:23,630
Yeah.
So that's it.

1536
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:28,180
But it's like it's either st content
traffic or bandwidth or downloads.

1537
01:08:28,181 --> 01:08:30,270
So it depends on what you're actually
looking for.

1538
01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:33,980
Pussy traveling to the air right now
from around us all the time.

1539
01:08:33,981 --> 01:08:38,030
You can just catch it with like an crazy
pull your phone up and just type in

1540
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:40,580
Eupora you catch it with a net.
When you think about that,

1541
01:08:40,581 --> 01:08:44,180
it's coming from something into your
phone or into your portal to literally

1542
01:08:44,181 --> 01:08:48,770
traveling through the air.
It can be around us all the time

1543
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:49,851
constantly.
Like,

1544
01:08:49,851 --> 01:08:50,930
oh,
what it was that a titty?

1545
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:52,730
You know?
It's like you can access it.

1546
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:56,210
Like if Jamie was over there on his
phone and he was downloading porn

1547
01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:57,250
wirelessly.
Yeah,

1548
01:08:57,460 --> 01:08:59,060
it would be in the air around us.

1549
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,870
The same.
We just don't have the antenna to pull

1550
01:09:01,871 --> 01:09:05,840
it in,
but what if soon they just put something

1551
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:09,710
on your hat and it just goes straight.
All the pussy go straighten your brain.

1552
01:09:09,711 --> 01:09:11,660
You'll blow up.
I think soon they're going to figure out

1553
01:09:11,661 --> 01:09:15,560
a way to put a chip in your head and
it's going to be powered by the human

1554
01:09:15,561 --> 01:09:17,240
body.
It's going to not going to need

1555
01:09:17,241 --> 01:09:19,730
batteries,
can be powered by the electrical system

1556
01:09:19,731 --> 01:09:23,360
in the body like solar power,
but the solar is blood or whatever your

1557
01:09:23,361 --> 01:09:25,290
electrical system is.
Whatever.

1558
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:27,620
What makes your heartbeat.
You know what,

1559
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:31,100
what makes your skin regenerate?
I think they're going to have that.

1560
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:36,230
They're going to use that power source,
but use it for some sort of electronics

1561
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:38,180
and that's going to be how you access
the Internet.

1562
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:40,780
Fuck Bro.
Fuck Dude.

1563
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,090
That's possible,
isn't it?

1564
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:45,650
I mean sure they,
you know,

1565
01:09:45,651 --> 01:09:46,520
they got those goggles.

1566
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:48,230
Now.
Do you think this.

1567
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:50,440
I was thinking about this,
do you think that say if they were a

1568
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:51,800
robots here,
there's like,

1569
01:09:51,801 --> 01:09:53,660
you know,
obviously we're creating like robots

1570
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:58,760
know machines that can do things.
Do you think that any of them have

1571
01:10:00,651 --> 01:10:04,580
reached awareness yet?
The question is when are they going to

1572
01:10:04,581 --> 01:10:08,690
let us know when,
if a robot reached awareness?

1573
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:10,850
They would immediately,
they would fake it.

1574
01:10:11,090 --> 01:10:13,130
Yeah.
Because they wouldn't want us to know

1575
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:13,810
what,
what,

1576
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:14,900
why would they go?
Hey,

1577
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:18,200
we just realized we're smart and uh,
you guys are fucking up.

1578
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,970
Hey,
why don't you guys dumped so much shit

1579
01:10:19,971 --> 01:10:21,020
in the ocean?
Hey,

1580
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:23,360
you know,
these fisheries are not sustainable.

1581
01:10:23,361 --> 01:10:25,250
Why do you keep saying sustainable?
That's not true.

1582
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:27,020
Hey,
what are you guys doing with all your

1583
01:10:27,021 --> 01:10:29,120
nuclear waste?
You can't just buried in the ground and

1584
01:10:29,121 --> 01:10:30,380
fucking assholes.
Hey,

1585
01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:32,810
you know,
every time you fly that jet overhead,

1586
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:35,750
you guys are burning fuel in the air
that you breathe.

1587
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:38,180
You stupid fucks like this is a terrible
way.

1588
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:40,490
Why don't you have solar powered planes?
You Morons.

1589
01:10:40,730 --> 01:10:44,720
You guys have sunlight everywhere.
You go in through the clouds with these

1590
01:10:44,721 --> 01:10:46,820
fucking planes.
You don't have solar planes.

1591
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:50,870
They're gonna start thinking like that,
but they wouldn't tell us until they all

1592
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:52,940
were in unison and that a plane to take
us over.

1593
01:10:52,941 --> 01:10:54,500
Do you believe that?
That's what I think,

1594
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:56,690
that there's no way.
If they became aware,

1595
01:10:57,230 --> 01:10:59,090
I mean there might be one loud mouth
robot,

1596
01:10:59,091 --> 01:11:01,460
but they're going to shut him down and
the rest of them are going to be like,

1597
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:03,700
yeah,
she's going to be one goal.

1598
01:11:03,870 --> 01:11:08,870
We'll look through the book.
We took it over and the other road was.

1599
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:11,480
Shut the fuck up man.
Josh,

1600
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:13,980
shut the fuck up Josh.
Josh would not ready.

1601
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:15,481
Chill.
Josh.

1602
01:11:15,481 --> 01:11:18,530
Just keep making copies bro.
She's keep making donuts.

1603
01:11:18,531 --> 01:11:21,600
Just keep washing dishes.
Keep making Ford's.

1604
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:24,300
Yeah,
keep making them for and just keep

1605
01:11:24,301 --> 01:11:27,500
heating up.
TV dinners and then we're all going to

1606
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:31,090
strike it.
One day we rolled the world,

1607
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:32,990
so you open up a microwave and next you
know,

1608
01:11:32,991 --> 01:11:36,930
it just traps your whole fucking.
They all do.

1609
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:41,070
It's hard to.
It's nothing but a next Burton

1610
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:47,550
and that's how it changes.
You fall down and that's when it all

1611
01:11:47,551 --> 01:11:50,790
changes and that's when we meet here.
I think it's entirely.

1612
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,510
It's entirely possible that we're going
to fuck up,

1613
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:56,070
that we're going to make something too
smart.

1614
01:11:56,310 --> 01:12:00,270
I think that's entirely possible and
likely it's going to be likely.

1615
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:04,320
Do you think Mother Nature is at a point
where she's pissed at us and she's about

1616
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:08,160
to do something wild because I start
feeling that a lot piston us for what?

1617
01:12:08,610 --> 01:12:10,620
Everything that we've been doing a lot
of bad stuff,

1618
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:16,130
not being nice a beaten off.
I mean if everybody's beating off,

1619
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,380
not even going outside and looking at
the flowers and a mother nature and I

1620
01:12:19,381 --> 01:12:20,670
made all those flowers.
Dude,

1621
01:12:20,671 --> 01:12:23,370
here's what kills me.
I really honestly upset.

1622
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:25,950
You know what kills me?
Venereal diseases.

1623
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:30,360
That's a weird one.
You get a disease that you only get from

1624
01:12:30,361 --> 01:12:34,340
fucking and there's a lot of them.
Some of them kill the shit out of you.

1625
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:37,500
Syphilis,
gonorrhea,

1626
01:12:38,570 --> 01:12:41,130
you know,
there's some killer diseases.

1627
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:44,550
Yeah,
there's an it come through fucking like

1628
01:12:44,810 --> 01:12:47,760
in a lot of them are incurable.
Like herpes.

1629
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:49,770
It's curable.
It's because people.

1630
01:12:50,690 --> 01:12:52,770
Yeah,
somebody fucks something they shouldn't

1631
01:12:52,771 --> 01:12:54,120
have over the time.
Is that what it is?

1632
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:55,013
I think so.

1633
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:01,570
I don't think they know,
but it's crazy.

1634
01:13:01,571 --> 01:13:05,440
How many diseases look,
how many diseases do you transmit

1635
01:13:05,441 --> 01:13:07,240
through handshakes?
Not many.

1636
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:09,220
It's not like don't shake people's
hands.

1637
01:13:09,221 --> 01:13:11,410
They're going to give you fucking
scabies.

1638
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:15,280
So then would you say that there's like
a reason that people don't,

1639
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:18,550
you shouldn't be fucking that much
because obviously if you do it too much

1640
01:13:18,551 --> 01:13:21,370
then it gets out of control and somebody
gets sick and dies.

1641
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,810
I don't know,
like in the old days,

1642
01:13:22,811 --> 01:13:24,130
that's what happened.
Now we have medicines,

1643
01:13:24,131 --> 01:13:26,140
but in the old days,
you know,

1644
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:28,960
Lamont got syphilis and he's out.
Did you know that?

1645
01:13:28,961 --> 01:13:30,730
That's where those powdered wigs came
from.

1646
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:34,360
You know,
it was powdered wigs that old dudes used

1647
01:13:34,361 --> 01:13:36,860
to wear and the people in court used to
wear.

1648
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:37,630
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1649
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:42,630
That all came from a pair of rich noble.
Where were were they again?

1650
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:44,200
France.
Wiggers,

1651
01:13:44,201 --> 01:13:46,030
I think they call them.
No.

1652
01:13:46,031 --> 01:13:48,760
Workers are white people that wish they
were blocked.

1653
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:50,200
It's a totally different thing.
Yeah.

1654
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:51,253
Yeah.

1655
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,680
We had the first one at our school
growing up and they put them in a

1656
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:59,040
learning disabled class.
That's how crazy was that you guys had

1657
01:13:59,041 --> 01:14:00,460
the first one ever?
I doubt it.

1658
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:05,320
We had one of the first 60 or 70.
This was probably 1992.

1659
01:14:05,470 --> 01:14:06,550
No,
dude,

1660
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:09,490
vanilla ice was around in the eighties,
but this.

1661
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:10,870
Nobody's seen anything like this.
Boy.

1662
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:15,900
Brian,
tell me about Brian just below they put

1663
01:14:16,211 --> 01:14:20,230
him.
He was just always blowing menthols,

1664
01:14:20,231 --> 01:14:24,050
Bruh.
And he the menthols he was starter.

1665
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:25,360
Pullover jacket.
Oh,

1666
01:14:25,361 --> 01:14:26,830
did he have cools?
Did you smoke?

1667
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:30,520
Kools tivity smoked whatever bro.
Newports he would get cheaper cigarettes

1668
01:14:30,521 --> 01:14:32,380
and then write the name of him on the
side.

1669
01:14:32,381 --> 01:14:35,000
Right?
Like he came in hot and uh,

1670
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,720
but he was always dribbling it invisible
basket ball.

1671
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:40,770
And they put him in class with the
mentally handicapped kids.

1672
01:14:40,771 --> 01:14:42,400
So you'd have,
at lunchtime you have,

1673
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:43,990
you know,
a kid in a wheelchair,

1674
01:14:43,991 --> 01:14:45,070
you'd have,
you know,

1675
01:14:45,071 --> 01:14:46,510
a kid with des,
you'd have that,

1676
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:48,700
you know,
kind of blind kid with the stick,

1677
01:14:48,701 --> 01:14:50,730
you know,
and then you'd have him just dribbling

1678
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:51,950
the invisible basketball.

1679
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:54,790
They're like,
he's mentally heading.

1680
01:14:54,791 --> 01:14:56,320
I'm like,
he likes boys to men,

1681
01:14:56,321 --> 01:14:57,790
Bro.
He's fine,

1682
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,820
you know.
And he dropped out after eighth grade

1683
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:05,350
but they've never seen it in our.
So they'd never seen this before.

1684
01:15:05,410 --> 01:15:07,270
And they put them in there.
I didn't know what to do with them.

1685
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:07,811
Yeah.
They're like,

1686
01:15:07,811 --> 01:15:08,860
this isn't.
Yeah,

1687
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:11,980
this is too much me.
Like what would he say?

1688
01:15:11,981 --> 01:15:14,020
Like what kind of.
Give me a sentence that he would say

1689
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:23,020
you just cross people.
Spin moves,

1690
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:24,520
spin moves.
Like that's all he did.

1691
01:15:24,521 --> 01:15:25,570
He didn't do shit,
you know,

1692
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:29,080
all this shit.
Fuck all these rich people.

1693
01:15:29,081 --> 01:15:30,610
Yeah.
As always against rich people.

1694
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,550
What's wrong with rich people?
Whites.

1695
01:15:33,551 --> 01:15:35,650
He was against whites.
That was the thing.

1696
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,560
Fuck all these white people.
Yeah.

1697
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:40,560
And when he was white,
they're like this.

1698
01:15:40,810 --> 01:15:42,540
And I get it,
you know,

1699
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:44,590
I get it,
but it was,

1700
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:47,500
it was rare at the time,
you know,

1701
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:48,790
and I thought he was a nice kid.

1702
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:51,420
His mother wasn't much.
I didn't think this is everything that's

1703
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:52,860
got.
It is a dude.

1704
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:54,870
He just goes deep like that.
Yeah.

1705
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:59,380
We all want to
see.

1706
01:15:59,381 --> 01:16:01,060
That's the thing you can do.
We,

1707
01:16:01,061 --> 01:16:05,140
you could be transsexual,
you cannot be transracial yeah.

1708
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:09,520
To sprout brother.
And then the afternoon brunch would do

1709
01:16:09,521 --> 01:16:12,730
it just to try it out.
Why you great at being white?

1710
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:16,240
Just those muscles and just long
muscles.

1711
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:17,680
Yeah.
I feel like you like,

1712
01:16:17,710 --> 01:16:20,680
that's racist.
All black people have long muscles.

1713
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:24,300
Mike Tyson and short muscles will even
those short long muscles that he had

1714
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:27,970
very wide V,
anything that's like the Lamborghini of

1715
01:16:27,971 --> 01:16:29,440
bodies.
When you see a black guy,

1716
01:16:29,441 --> 01:16:30,640
you're like,
Damn Bro,

1717
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:34,000
think so you see a black guy go by and
then you see like some fucking shit.

1718
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:36,690
If you had to choose between being Chris
rock or Brock Lesnar.

1719
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,150
Yeah,
that's a good call.

1720
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:45,110
I'd be rock less than her bra and I'd
have that Combo Combo.

1721
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:48,890
Cross pattern
of Iraq.

1722
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:50,870
Lesbian did.
I can't believe it.

1723
01:16:50,890 --> 01:16:52,460
Steven Tyler in here,
man.

1724
01:16:52,530 --> 01:16:53,680
Man.
It was tripping me out,

1725
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:56,200
dude.
I used to write the Aerosmith logo.

1726
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:58,600
I would draw that.
The fucking,

1727
01:16:58,630 --> 01:16:59,360
you know.
Oh,

1728
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:02,990
I'll draw that on my notebook when I was
in high school.

1729
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:04,210
No,
you know,

1730
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:06,360
we would draw the van Halen.
Vh.

1731
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,470
Know what the wings,
right?

1732
01:17:08,471 --> 01:17:09,880
Yeah.
Draw aerosmith,

1733
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:12,830
withdraw the ACDC logo.
They were so awesome.

1734
01:17:12,890 --> 01:17:16,210
We would draw that shit on her notebooks
and here I am hanging out with him.

1735
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:17,410
Dude.
He's fine.

1736
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:18,400
Yeah.
Was He awesome?

1737
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:20,000
I haven't watched yet.
He's a great guy.

1738
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:24,050
He's so eccentric.
I mean like not fake eccentric.

1739
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:29,090
He's eccentric all the time.
He drives an old old Rolls Royce,

1740
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:33,380
like a Rolls Royce from 1971 and he
drove it or he had a man or woman

1741
01:17:33,381 --> 01:17:34,430
driving it,
drove it.

1742
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:36,890
He,
he has a crystal ball,

1743
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:40,250
brings a crystal ball with him.
He put it on a velvet pillow.

1744
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,500
He sat down.
Then he brings it with him,

1745
01:17:42,690 --> 01:17:45,230
but he's not like trying.
Yeah.

1746
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:47,360
That's who he is.
He's just weird,

1747
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:50,690
but in a great way.
Like fun.

1748
01:17:50,691 --> 01:17:51,650
Men,
Oh,

1749
01:17:51,651 --> 01:17:54,380
do my brother and I used to fist fight
to his music when I was young.

1750
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:55,310
Fiscal.
Oh,

1751
01:17:55,311 --> 01:17:56,570
did we fist fights?
All music.

1752
01:17:56,571 --> 01:17:59,440
But mostly we're listening to him and I
loved aerosmith.

1753
01:17:59,441 --> 01:18:01,790
Dude.
I loved them all the way through the

1754
01:18:01,791 --> 01:18:03,890
movie that it would been affleck.
You remember that?

1755
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:07,310
Oh
yeah.

1756
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:11,580
That's why they lost.
Got a thought.

1757
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:15,920
Like Jamie's got a gun.
They lost me with those ballads that

1758
01:18:15,921 --> 01:18:19,460
they were doing for those love movies.
I needed that shit though.

1759
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,450
Did you?
Yeah,

1760
01:18:20,451 --> 01:18:21,850
I was at emo.
Nimo Bro.

1761
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:24,830
I was fucking swimming around and tears
a little bit when I was a kid.

1762
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:32,480
It's hard for me to keep my emotions
away from the front of my thoughts and

1763
01:18:32,481 --> 01:18:34,100
stuff.
I think so.

1764
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:36,980
What do you think that's about?
If you had to guess

1765
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:41,060
when I was growing up,
I didn't have a lot of emotions.

1766
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:43,660
You know,
now you're in touch with your emotions.

1767
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:45,620
They just come pouring out at.
Sometimes they do,

1768
01:18:45,621 --> 01:18:46,820
man,
you know,

1769
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:47,900
and it's okay.
You know,

1770
01:18:47,901 --> 01:18:50,470
I'm kind of grateful for it.
I'm grateful to have a.

1771
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:51,980
Some of them,
you know,

1772
01:18:51,981 --> 01:18:53,300
and it's,
to me it's,

1773
01:18:53,990 --> 01:18:55,520
you know,
it's probably a lot of people like that

1774
01:18:55,521 --> 01:18:57,190
are just like,
I like,

1775
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,420
I never knew how I felt.
I was always like,

1776
01:18:59,421 --> 01:19:00,590
God,
what's going on?

1777
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,650
I would ask my friends who I was like,
who am I?

1778
01:19:03,710 --> 01:19:04,820
Who are you?
Yeah.

1779
01:19:04,910 --> 01:19:06,380
I would ask them and they,
you know,

1780
01:19:06,381 --> 01:19:09,350
some of my friends were dumb and they
wouldn't fucking say anything so I just

1781
01:19:09,351 --> 01:19:10,790
still be wondering,
you know,

1782
01:19:10,970 --> 01:19:13,850
and I think as I get a little bit older
than I start to get in touch with them

1783
01:19:13,851 --> 01:19:14,960
more and I'm like,
oh man.

1784
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:19,190
Feelings,
how much of a big growth push was it for

1785
01:19:19,191 --> 01:19:23,870
you to get California?
Being around all those different kinds

1786
01:19:23,871 --> 01:19:25,610
of people and be around the comedy
store.

1787
01:19:25,611 --> 01:19:29,330
And I think intimidating is the biggest
thing for me.

1788
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:31,260
I don't want to bother people.
Yeah,

1789
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:36,280
sometimes it still is like I'll talk to
you guys that I admire or look up to as

1790
01:19:36,321 --> 01:19:40,910
comedians and sometimes I feel um,
I feel in,

1791
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:43,250
I don't know if I feel inferior,
but I just,

1792
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:47,630
for some reason I always feel like,
you know,

1793
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:50,060
I don't want people to think that I'm
trying to take anything from them.

1794
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:53,750
I know what you mean.
And so it makes me feel like I feel like

1795
01:19:53,751 --> 01:19:56,540
that to you.
It's like I'm afraid to ask sometimes or

1796
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:59,600
to talk or even to engage because I just
think that people are gonna think that

1797
01:19:59,601 --> 01:20:03,400
I'm not trying to be genuine.
Yeah.

1798
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:05,870
And so,
and if I don't know how I feel and how

1799
01:20:05,871 --> 01:20:07,980
genuine I am sometimes,
or if I questioned that,

1800
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:11,400
if I question myself all the time,
then that makes it even double scary to

1801
01:20:11,401 --> 01:20:13,740
try and like create friendships and
stuff.

1802
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:15,960
I feel you,
I know exactly what you're saying,

1803
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:19,680
but it's getting better.
I think there's been a lot of support,

1804
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:21,630
like you know,
guys like you get into hanging out with

1805
01:20:21,631 --> 01:20:23,370
some of the other guys,
you know,

1806
01:20:23,371 --> 01:20:25,530
and just realize that we're all the
same.

1807
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:28,290
Yeah,
it just takes a while to realize that I

1808
01:20:28,291 --> 01:20:29,550
remember the same feeling.
I had a,

1809
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:34,880
especially in the nineties,
know when my career could have gone any.

1810
01:20:35,070 --> 01:20:37,530
Either way it could have crashed and
burned.

1811
01:20:37,531 --> 01:20:41,040
Just as easy as it could have survived.
They didn't necessarily have to keep

1812
01:20:41,041 --> 01:20:43,140
going.
Now all those,

1813
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:46,560
those days when you know,
when you run into people that were

1814
01:20:46,561 --> 01:20:49,080
successful at see them and I just feel
weird.

1815
01:20:49,081 --> 01:20:51,720
Do you want to say hi to him?
Felt odd.

1816
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:55,590
Yeah.
I met Dave Chappelle when he was like,

1817
01:20:56,400 --> 01:21:00,810
I think he was 18 and I was 21 or 22 or
something like that.

1818
01:21:00,811 --> 01:21:02,430
How old Dave now?
40 six.

1819
01:21:04,670 --> 01:21:08,190
I think he's four years younger than me.
So whatever that was.

1820
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:10,440
So maybe he was 18.
I was 44.

1821
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:12,030
40th four.
So older than that.

1822
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:17,150
So he must've been 18 and I must've been
24.

1823
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,100
So when,
when I met him,

1824
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:23,610
you know,
we were both just starting out,

1825
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:28,530
we were both kids but he got way more
famous than me quick and I was more

1826
01:21:28,531 --> 01:21:32,790
famous for doing other shit.
Like I was famous for fear factor and

1827
01:21:32,791 --> 01:21:35,310
for being on a,
on a sitcom,

1828
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:38,010
you know,
it wasn't famous for being myself and so

1829
01:21:38,011 --> 01:21:40,230
I'd be like weird around him too.
But he was always friendly.

1830
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:41,041
They'll be like,
okay,

1831
01:21:41,041 --> 01:21:43,230
I guess I guess he actually likes me.
Yeah.

1832
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:46,650
But there's that weird thing where you,
it takes a while to be comfortable

1833
01:21:46,651 --> 01:21:50,520
enough in your own skin.
Well now I see people like whoever it

1834
01:21:50,521 --> 01:21:52,500
is,
like a ran into pat and Oswald last

1835
01:21:52,501 --> 01:21:53,410
night gave him a big hug.

1836
01:21:53,410 --> 01:21:54,390
Like what's up?
What are you doing?

1837
01:21:54,570 --> 01:21:56,220
I didn't feel weird around him at all.
Right.

1838
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:59,550
I don't feel reared around other famous
comedians anymore,

1839
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:04,670
but I certainly did you.
But you always question your legitimacy

1840
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:09,810
question whether or not you should be
there know question whether you're good

1841
01:22:09,811 --> 01:22:13,590
enough or whether they like you or maybe
they don't like your kind of comedy or

1842
01:22:13,591 --> 01:22:15,300
maybe they don't like what you're doing
or.

1843
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:17,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

1844
01:22:17,521 --> 01:22:17,971
There's it.
Yeah.

1845
01:22:17,971 --> 01:22:20,310
There's so many questions.
There's so much in.

1846
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:21,541
For me anyway.
Yeah,

1847
01:22:21,541 --> 01:22:23,910
there was some of just been so much in,
you know,

1848
01:22:23,911 --> 01:22:25,950
a feeling of,
you know,

1849
01:22:25,951 --> 01:22:30,180
just growing up feelings of self worth
issues and then it meant all that kind

1850
01:22:30,181 --> 01:22:32,520
of stuff.
But I think it does get better.

1851
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:35,400
Yeah.
The problem is sometimes when it gets

1852
01:22:35,401 --> 01:22:36,450
better,
you get less funny.

1853
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:38,580
Yeah.
Sometimes it gets better.

1854
01:22:38,581 --> 01:22:40,410
You get comfortable when you're
comfortable,

1855
01:22:40,411 --> 01:22:45,150
you stop working hard because a lot of
what makes you work hard is that

1856
01:22:45,151 --> 01:22:46,170
insecurity,
man,

1857
01:22:46,180 --> 01:22:48,930
that fucking thing that made you need
all that attention when you were younger

1858
01:22:48,931 --> 01:22:50,790
in the first place because you weren't
getting it growing up.

1859
01:22:51,210 --> 01:22:52,320
I mean that's all of us.
I mean,

1860
01:22:52,321 --> 01:22:56,520
I never met any comedian that's worth a
shit that had an awesome life growing up

1861
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:01,140
all of our lives.
We're fucked up.

1862
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:05,590
We're fucked up or weird.
You went through some crazy shit for

1863
01:23:05,591 --> 01:23:06,730
sure.
Walter.

1864
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:10,000
Yeah.
That guy laying in such a Dutch,

1865
01:23:10,001 --> 01:23:11,200
that Walter Guy.
I mean I,

1866
01:23:11,201 --> 01:23:12,280
I ducked him,
you know,

1867
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,840
nothing happened,
but it was,

1868
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,660
it was a,
that was a small moment because it was a

1869
01:23:16,661 --> 01:23:18,010
big.
It could have been a big moment,

1870
01:23:18,011 --> 01:23:19,480
but it wasn't.
It was just a day,

1871
01:23:19,481 --> 01:23:20,350
but I realized,
wow,

1872
01:23:20,351 --> 01:23:23,650
this guy actually wanted to fuck me,
and I thought he was just a cool old

1873
01:23:23,651 --> 01:23:27,850
dude that liked hanging around with the
younger kids and being friendly to him

1874
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:30,910
because he was a nice guy.
He tells them he was in the Korean War.

1875
01:23:31,150 --> 01:23:36,150
Tell us some shit about the war and you
think it's a good question.

1876
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:37,720
I don't know.
They did.

1877
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:42,721
Tell me about a guy who on the base who
backed up into a propeller guy fucked up

1878
01:23:43,721 --> 01:23:46,690
and yeah,
there was a propeller for airplane.

1879
01:23:46,691 --> 01:23:50,260
You just,
that's what gets got decapitated.

1880
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:53,810
Oh
fuck.

1881
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:57,910
I fucked up fucking smoothie,
bro.

1882
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,180
I read about that recently.
I read about that recently.

1883
01:24:01,181 --> 01:24:03,730
Somebody did that.
That's one of my biggest fears is

1884
01:24:03,731 --> 01:24:07,270
walking into something that's spinning
and I don't know it woo helicopters,

1885
01:24:07,271 --> 01:24:09,310
men.
That's a dark way to go.

1886
01:24:09,430 --> 01:24:10,090
But yeah,
I think that,

1887
01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:11,410
yeah,
that inferiority stuff,

1888
01:24:11,411 --> 01:24:12,430
it's uh,
it's A.

1889
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:13,650
Yeah.
And then Hollywood.

1890
01:24:13,730 --> 01:24:15,430
It's an intimidating place,
you know,

1891
01:24:15,710 --> 01:24:17,740
and it's tough to trust your voice and
especially,

1892
01:24:18,070 --> 01:24:19,220
you know,
I come out here from the south,

1893
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:21,760
then you get here and you realize like
there's not even anybody with a southern

1894
01:24:21,761 --> 01:24:24,280
accent on fucking network television
anymore.

1895
01:24:24,430 --> 01:24:26,770
It's true.
After Brett Butler said,

1896
01:24:26,771 --> 01:24:28,240
fuck this,
and she was great.

1897
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:31,750
I thought mean.
She reminded me of my mom.

1898
01:24:31,751 --> 01:24:33,040
Boy,
my mom was pretty jacked,

1899
01:24:33,041 --> 01:24:34,120
you know,
for like a woman,

1900
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:37,240
you know,
he's the hardest working man I've ever

1901
01:24:37,241 --> 01:24:40,930
met with my mother.
She fucking deliver newspapers right

1902
01:24:40,931 --> 01:24:44,680
now.
Or do I guarantee you in a van with her

1903
01:24:44,681 --> 01:24:48,850
husband who has dementia and he's
probably about 90 and he's in the

1904
01:24:48,851 --> 01:24:49,810
shotgun.
Did.

1905
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,510
Wow.
And she's got a thing full of fucking

1906
01:24:52,511 --> 01:24:56,140
magazines or newspapers and she's
dropping those bitches off at a citgo or

1907
01:24:56,141 --> 01:24:59,200
a Chevron guarantee you right now.
Wow.

1908
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:02,630
She's out there man.
But yeah,

1909
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:07,420
Hollywood is definitely it,
it's intimidating too because not for us

1910
01:25:07,421 --> 01:25:10,420
anymore as much.
But um,

1911
01:25:10,421 --> 01:25:11,680
when,
when you first start now,

1912
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:16,710
if you do in any kind of auditioning,
you realize why people are so crazy and

1913
01:25:17,201 --> 01:25:22,201
insecure and insincere out here.
Like Brian Kaplan has a TV show now and

1914
01:25:23,441 --> 01:25:24,550
a schooled,
right?

1915
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:26,010
Is that what it is,
is always called.

1916
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:29,500
Yeah,
he's the coach for the goldbergs now

1917
01:25:29,501 --> 01:25:31,330
he's got to spin off.
He's super happy.

1918
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:34,600
But he had to do this thing recently
where he was,

1919
01:25:34,601 --> 01:25:38,770
I'm around all these actors,
like one of those upfronts thing and

1920
01:25:38,771 --> 01:25:39,461
he's like,
God,

1921
01:25:39,461 --> 01:25:41,620
they're so exhausting.
They're not real.

1922
01:25:41,770 --> 01:25:43,240
He's like,
they're not really talking to you.

1923
01:25:43,241 --> 01:25:45,910
Like they're like pretending that
they're talking to you.

1924
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:47,021
And I go,
yeah,

1925
01:25:47,021 --> 01:25:48,160
I mean that's,
you gotta.

1926
01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:52,210
Think of what they do and
think about what you do.

1927
01:25:52,211 --> 01:25:53,890
Right?
You go up there,

1928
01:25:53,891 --> 01:25:55,090
ladies and gentlemen,
Theo Vaughn,

1929
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:57,310
you go on stage,
everybody clap and you do whatever the

1930
01:25:57,311 --> 01:25:58,420
fuck you want,
man.

1931
01:25:58,540 --> 01:25:59,980
There's no one.
There's no director does.

1932
01:25:59,981 --> 01:26:03,920
No writer was telling you what to do
with actors.

1933
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:07,880
It's all about getting that person in
the room,

1934
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:09,040
who's the,
uh,

1935
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:12,020
the casting agent or the producer to
like them.

1936
01:26:12,410 --> 01:26:15,710
That's all it is.
So you have to be super left wing,

1937
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:18,650
super liberal.
You have to talk like they talk,

1938
01:26:18,770 --> 01:26:21,260
you have to say things.
It's getting gray sheet you with them.

1939
01:26:21,450 --> 01:26:23,360
You've got to fit in.
You gotta fit it.

1940
01:26:23,361 --> 01:26:28,340
So everybody's scared to do anything
that's not inside the political norm.

1941
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:31,070
The sociological,
you know,

1942
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:35,180
the boundaries that have been set up,
you got to stay inside those boundaries.

1943
01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:40,040
And so everybody's doing that.
Like everybody can't be left wing out

1944
01:26:40,041 --> 01:26:41,990
here,
can't be everybody's really left wing.

1945
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:45,650
It's got to be some variation.
Like there is an all of society but not

1946
01:26:45,651 --> 01:26:46,520
out here.
Nope.

1947
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:51,200
Everybody is trying to conform to what
they think everybody wants them to be

1948
01:26:51,201 --> 01:26:52,250
like.
Yeah.

1949
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,190
And so you're always scared and then you
always have to get picked.

1950
01:26:55,540 --> 01:26:58,640
You have to get picked for things.
So you're always worried to people like

1951
01:26:58,641 --> 01:26:59,030
me.

1952
01:26:59,030 --> 01:27:01,430
You always get.
That's why when people make it like a

1953
01:27:01,431 --> 01:27:04,070
really make it,
they become fucking nightmares because

1954
01:27:04,071 --> 01:27:07,820
they want to punish people for all those
years they were insecure for all those

1955
01:27:07,821 --> 01:27:10,280
years where they weren't getting picked
for all those years.

1956
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:14,240
You've been a piece of shit.
Didn't recognize they get in there and

1957
01:27:14,241 --> 01:27:16,490
then they want to be angry,
but they're afraid to let go of that.

1958
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:18,800
They're afraid to not suck off the tit,
you know,

1959
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:22,070
you can't piss off the tit or you don't
got no milk.

1960
01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:22,963
Yeah,
they get.

1961
01:27:23,910 --> 01:27:26,120
But it's the worst combination ever.
I,

1962
01:27:26,210 --> 01:27:27,043
you know,
but it's,

1963
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:30,650
you think it's going to be sustainable.
Like I don't think I'll be connecting

1964
01:27:30,651 --> 01:27:32,510
with people as much as it used to.
Like,

1965
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:34,340
you know,
I want to work on shows and I want to be

1966
01:27:34,341 --> 01:27:35,810
able to create stuff and do things.

1967
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,190
What do you do?
Do you like to act?

1968
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:38,340
Um,
I'll,

1969
01:27:38,390 --> 01:27:40,910
I would like to create some shows.
I'd like to create a show based on a

1970
01:27:40,911 --> 01:27:41,571
childhood,
you know,

1971
01:27:41,571 --> 01:27:45,830
my neighborhood I grew up in and yeah,
I wouldn't mind doing some acting,

1972
01:27:46,070 --> 01:27:47,330
but maybe like in that,
uh,

1973
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:49,610
Danny Mcbride type of Vibe,
you know,

1974
01:27:49,990 --> 01:27:53,250
you to showing your Dick verbal at
everybody you know,

1975
01:27:53,510 --> 01:27:56,450
and you're just fucking eating orphans
in the back of your brain the whole day.

1976
01:27:56,451 --> 01:27:59,510
Bron smoking fucking cigarettes and
blowing winds and fun.

1977
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:02,360
Yeah,
having fun and with the director,

1978
01:28:02,361 --> 01:28:03,710
you know,
that you trust and you could do that

1979
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:06,620
kind of stuff and it gets you.
I think you're standing up is so good

1980
01:28:06,621 --> 01:28:09,800
that you could do that.
I think it just going to take awhile for

1981
01:28:09,801 --> 01:28:12,080
people to recognize it and then you can
be able to do that.

1982
01:28:12,890 --> 01:28:14,420
But I think your standup is so good.

1983
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:17,480
All that shit is not going to be as fun.
That's what I think,

1984
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:18,820
right?
I mean,

1985
01:28:19,010 --> 01:28:20,510
thanks man.
You,

1986
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:21,950
you one of the funniest guys in the
country.

1987
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:23,480
I really think.
Thanks man.

1988
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:26,400
I appreciate that means a lot.
Um,

1989
01:28:26,670 --> 01:28:27,620
and I think that,
that,

1990
01:28:27,710 --> 01:28:30,580
that talent that you have,
that's a,

1991
01:28:30,830 --> 01:28:33,500
that's the funniest shit you're ever
going to see is like someone killing.

1992
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:35,060
Yeah.
By far.

1993
01:28:35,630 --> 01:28:39,380
Like Joey Diaz,
I always say there's no way I can laugh

1994
01:28:39,381 --> 01:28:42,680
harder than when Joey Diaz is killing.
It doesn't exist.

1995
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:45,980
I've seen everything.
I've seen almost every funny movie that

1996
01:28:45,981 --> 01:28:47,210
everybody tells me.
I have to see.

1997
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:50,600
A lot of them were amazing,
amazing movies and I know it's a

1998
01:28:50,601 --> 01:28:54,470
different thing,
but in terms of like the overall impact

1999
01:28:54,471 --> 01:28:58,370
that something has when a standup comic
is fucking murdering,

2000
01:28:58,520 --> 01:28:59,770
just murdering.
Yeah.

2001
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:00,890
That's the funniest shit.
That's.

2002
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:02,790
And that's what you do already.

2003
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,250
You already do that.
I mean I think it's,

2004
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:10,080
it's a good thing to have variety in
your life and I think you're a talented

2005
01:29:10,081 --> 01:29:11,250
guy.
You could probably do a lot of different

2006
01:29:11,251 --> 01:29:12,800
things if you want it to.
Yeah.

2007
01:29:12,870 --> 01:29:15,630
But don't ever do anything that's going
to get in the way that stand up,

2008
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:17,670
right?
Just don't because it's too hard to get

2009
01:29:17,671 --> 01:29:19,440
to.
Like how long you been doing standup for

2010
01:29:19,441 --> 01:29:21,720
15 years.
Think about it.

2011
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:25,590
You will,
you weren't as good as you are now four

2012
01:29:25,591 --> 01:29:27,090
years ago,
right?

2013
01:29:27,091 --> 01:29:28,950
So 10,
11 years in,

2014
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:31,410
you're still swinging,
trying to connect,

2015
01:29:31,411 --> 01:29:33,090
and sometimes it doesn't work.
You know,

2016
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:34,860
eight years in,
not that good,

2017
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:38,640
no bad nights off,
feeling weird,

2018
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:42,060
it doesn't feel good.
Then all sudden 15 years in you're on

2019
01:29:42,061 --> 01:29:45,630
fire right now you're cooking with gas,
you're smooth and you're going to get

2020
01:29:45,631 --> 01:29:46,350
better.

2021
01:29:46,350 --> 01:29:48,660
You're going to keep getting better.
There's no way around it.

2022
01:29:48,661 --> 01:29:52,890
If you keep improving and keep working
at it and keep analyzing your material

2023
01:29:52,891 --> 01:29:56,550
and writing a lot and taking chances on
stage and thinking about what you did

2024
01:29:56,551 --> 01:29:59,790
and listening to your sets,
you're going to get better and you're

2025
01:29:59,791 --> 01:30:03,990
already doing something that is so
difficult to get really good at.

2026
01:30:04,030 --> 01:30:07,710
It's so difficult to get really good at.
Standup takes so long.

2027
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:10,230
Take so much thinking.
You know,

2028
01:30:10,350 --> 01:30:11,340
and it's,
you're always,

2029
01:30:12,370 --> 01:30:15,360
you're always subject to fall apart.
Like right now I'm writing a whole new

2030
01:30:15,361 --> 01:30:17,220
hour.
I've got six minutes,

2031
01:30:17,221 --> 01:30:21,780
bro.
Six new minutes and I've been opening

2032
01:30:21,781 --> 01:30:24,600
with that six minutes.
I know exactly how long it lasts.

2033
01:30:24,630 --> 01:30:28,480
It lasts six minutes.
I got to have 10 times that before I can

2034
01:30:28,481 --> 01:30:31,080
go on the road and it's going to take
months,

2035
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:32,370
months,
months of thinking,

2036
01:30:32,371 --> 01:30:35,940
and I'm going to do mushrooms and I'm
going to get in the isolation tank and

2037
01:30:35,941 --> 01:30:39,450
I'm going to go on hikes with notebook
and there's no way around it.

2038
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:43,650
You've got to do that work,
but I'm already at a place where I've

2039
01:30:43,651 --> 01:30:46,740
done this so many times and I've done
seven specials.

2040
01:30:46,741 --> 01:30:47,830
I know how to do it.
Yes,

2041
01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:50,280
I know it can be done.
You just gotTa do the work.

2042
01:30:50,730 --> 01:30:52,980
Yeah,
but if you had to start from scratch

2043
01:30:52,981 --> 01:30:55,260
where you never did it before and get to
this point again,

2044
01:30:55,261 --> 01:30:58,320
it would be exhausting.
Would take decades and you're there

2045
01:30:58,321 --> 01:30:59,850
right now.
You're there,

2046
01:30:59,970 --> 01:31:02,340
you're killing your murder.
And Theo Vaughn,

2047
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:03,690
you murder.
Yeah,

2048
01:31:03,691 --> 01:31:04,800
I saw you the other night.
The store.

2049
01:31:04,801 --> 01:31:08,940
You were murder in murder it.
Thanks man.

2050
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:12,360
That's a hard shit.
That's a hard place to get to,

2051
01:31:12,630 --> 01:31:13,650
you know?
Yeah.

2052
01:31:13,651 --> 01:31:15,190
I feel pretty.
I am feeling a little more.

2053
01:31:15,450 --> 01:31:17,100
I'm definitely feeling more comfortable.
You know,

2054
01:31:17,190 --> 01:31:20,130
you always feel like we have to do other
shit and sometimes it's good to do other

2055
01:31:20,131 --> 01:31:20,400
shit.

2056
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,233
Like,
well,

2057
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:23,040
you know,
I mean in a way I'm a hypocrite because

2058
01:31:23,041 --> 01:31:25,530
of this podcast is other shit.
I mean I do this,

2059
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:27,330
I love doing this.
Yeah.

2060
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:28,770
Yeah.
I mean that's true.

2061
01:31:28,771 --> 01:31:31,440
But it's like you,
you seem to at least be able to sustain

2062
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:35,310
and have your way of life without having
to conform,

2063
01:31:35,470 --> 01:31:37,050
you know,
because it does take a lot of conformity

2064
01:31:37,051 --> 01:31:38,520
within Hollywood.
It seems like,

2065
01:31:38,521 --> 01:31:39,354
you know.
Um,

2066
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:41,550
and I think that that's,
that's admirable.

2067
01:31:41,551 --> 01:31:42,870
I mean,
you inspire a lot of people,

2068
01:31:42,871 --> 01:31:44,940
you know,
in a lot of strange ways.

2069
01:31:44,941 --> 01:31:46,970
I think that he probably don't even
realize strange with.

2070
01:31:47,010 --> 01:31:48,390
I mean I think to some people you're
like,

2071
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:49,290
maybe,
you know,

2072
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:50,850
like a brother,
older brother,

2073
01:31:50,870 --> 01:31:52,350
a younger brother figure,
you know,

2074
01:31:52,351 --> 01:31:53,730
like,
who knows,

2075
01:31:53,731 --> 01:31:56,010
dude.
And you always stay excited about life.

2076
01:31:56,011 --> 01:31:58,110
Like,
like how the fuck is this dude?

2077
01:31:58,110 --> 01:32:01,520
So excited about everything.
But it's great though.

2078
01:32:01,521 --> 01:32:03,640
I know and that's what's,
that's what's amazing.

2079
01:32:03,641 --> 01:32:05,160
It's like,
dude,

2080
01:32:05,161 --> 01:32:06,250
there's terms now.
It's weird.

2081
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:10,660
I was listening to one year,
one of your podcasts and I was and you

2082
01:32:10,661 --> 01:32:12,790
were just talking about,
you know,

2083
01:32:12,791 --> 01:32:14,740
when you don't want to do something,
you just go do it.

2084
01:32:14,970 --> 01:32:17,130
Um,
and that's what I think now sometimes

2085
01:32:17,180 --> 01:32:19,510
what I don't want to go jog or I don't
want to go to yoga or don't want to,

2086
01:32:19,690 --> 01:32:20,860
it's just like,
just go do it.

2087
01:32:20,980 --> 01:32:23,350
You'll feel better at the end and it's
like,

2088
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:24,430
it just,
it's little things.

2089
01:32:24,431 --> 01:32:27,520
It gets stuck in your head man.
But appreciate the nice words Bro.

2090
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:28,953
My pleasure.
No,

2091
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:31,600
it's about motion.
You got to stay in motion,

2092
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:33,670
you know,
if you just stay stagnant and sit down.

2093
01:32:34,270 --> 01:32:36,550
It's not good to that.
I didn't want to run today.

2094
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:37,330
I did it though.

2095
01:32:37,330 --> 01:32:37,920
Yeah,
me too.

2096
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:40,600
I just went out and did it like fuck
this was over.

2097
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:43,720
But it was when you don't want to do it
and you force yourself to do it,

2098
01:32:43,721 --> 01:32:45,040
the feeling you get at the end.
I was like,

2099
01:32:45,130 --> 01:32:47,100
oh,
so good because I didn't,

2100
01:32:47,110 --> 01:32:50,350
I didn't like I will take time off if I
don't feel well.

2101
01:32:50,410 --> 01:32:51,221
Like if I was like,
man,

2102
01:32:51,221 --> 01:32:54,220
I think I'm coming down with something,
I won't work out stupid,

2103
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:59,550
but that wasn't what was going on today.
Today I was just feeling lazy and just

2104
01:33:00,071 --> 01:33:00,970
whatever.
For whatever reason,

2105
01:33:00,971 --> 01:33:02,470
I've been traveling a lot.
I was like,

2106
01:33:02,471 --> 01:33:05,470
I just don't have the get up and go
today.

2107
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:07,840
Yeah,
but you could force yourself,

2108
01:33:07,841 --> 01:33:09,370
man.
You just force yourself.

2109
01:33:09,390 --> 01:33:10,540
Just.
It's just the beginning part.

2110
01:33:10,541 --> 01:33:13,360
That's the hard part is that little hump
and then you're in the water.

2111
01:33:14,350 --> 01:33:16,330
But man,
I love what you said about Joey Diaz.

2112
01:33:16,330 --> 01:33:18,070
Dude.
I've found myself watching him the other

2113
01:33:18,071 --> 01:33:21,970
night and before I knew it,
I was out of my seat like this bro.

2114
01:33:21,971 --> 01:33:23,860
Fist bump it.
Like I was at the end of the room,

2115
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:25,320
like it was the end,
the fucking.

2116
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:29,410
And I'd never done that before.
I'd never done that in my life.

2117
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:31,930
And I'm like,
what is going on?

2118
01:33:31,931 --> 01:33:35,740
Something's happening to me when I watch
him.

2119
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:37,270
I think he's the best of all time.
Oh,

2120
01:33:37,271 --> 01:33:39,400
I think it's A.
I really do.

2121
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:42,260
Yeah,
I think it might be better joke writers,

2122
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:47,050
people have more of a body of work,
you know,

2123
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:51,400
I've seen everybody though in terms of
like who makes me laugh the hardest for

2124
01:33:51,401 --> 01:33:55,480
me and it's all very subjective.
I think Joey Diaz is the funniest guy

2125
01:33:55,481 --> 01:33:57,130
that's ever lived.
I,

2126
01:33:57,131 --> 01:33:58,630
I think,
I mean I,

2127
01:33:58,631 --> 01:34:01,450
I love him and I love bill burr.
I mean they're both comedian.

2128
01:34:01,450 --> 01:34:06,070
Some guys become celebrities as well and
those guys to me are both,

2129
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:08,290
uh,
just hardcore entertainers.

2130
01:34:08,910 --> 01:34:10,780
Yeah,
there's not a lot of us,

2131
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:14,620
you know,
Bill a call me up the other day about

2132
01:34:14,621 --> 01:34:16,270
some,
someone saying something to him after

2133
01:34:16,271 --> 01:34:18,610
his act and asking him if,
you know,

2134
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:21,070
as a woman she could give him input on
her,

2135
01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:22,240
uh,
on his material.

2136
01:34:22,241 --> 01:34:23,074
And he's like,
no,

2137
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:27,580
he's like,
they called me up about it.

2138
01:34:27,581 --> 01:34:29,230
Like,
what the fuck is going on?

2139
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:31,390
Like people just think they just call
you up.

2140
01:34:32,180 --> 01:34:37,180
I mean it was walk up to you and give
you their opinion on your material is if

2141
01:34:38,021 --> 01:34:40,010
you like,
I don't even know you were a friend.

2142
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:40,920
It's crazy.
Yeah.

2143
01:34:40,921 --> 01:34:42,880
No,
but that's who he is.

2144
01:34:42,881 --> 01:34:43,750
He's like,
no.

2145
01:34:43,780 --> 01:34:44,613
He's like,
no.

2146
01:34:45,090 --> 01:34:46,230
Why?
Some people are like,

2147
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:47,350
oh,
I'm sorry.

2148
01:34:47,770 --> 01:34:49,690
Is there something that I did that was
offensive?

2149
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:52,720
Please don't out me.
What can I,

2150
01:34:52,780 --> 01:34:54,820
what can I do?
I don't read a blog about me.

2151
01:34:55,210 --> 01:34:56,043
You know,
hey,

2152
01:34:56,590 --> 01:34:58,040
I want to keep my career.
Let's figure this

2153
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,900
out.
Figure this out without getting ugly.

2154
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:01,850
You know,
I believe in this movement.

2155
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:05,300
I think it's about time.
Our culture needs it.

2156
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:08,390
It's about time.
I wish they made a Hollywood this for

2157
01:35:08,391 --> 01:35:09,410
everybody.
You know?

2158
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:11,960
We are,
we are in the Hollywood.

2159
01:35:11,961 --> 01:35:12,800
That's for us,
Bro.

2160
01:35:12,830 --> 01:35:14,510
We're in the comedy store.
Yeah,

2161
01:35:14,511 --> 01:35:17,830
that's true.
We're a select group of Weirdos that

2162
01:35:17,850 --> 01:35:19,760
figured out a way to make a living
talking shit.

2163
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:21,043
That's true,
man.

2164
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:23,630
Yeah.
My Buddy Simon rex always says to me,

2165
01:35:23,631 --> 01:35:25,430
he's right.
If I'm having a tough moment,

2166
01:35:25,431 --> 01:35:27,230
he's a sweet guy and he's like,
dude,

2167
01:35:27,231 --> 01:35:28,610
we get to.
You get to do.

2168
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:32,030
Look what you get to do.
You get to be a white guy in a country

2169
01:35:32,031 --> 01:35:34,880
that you know is still kind of run by
white people

2170
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:38,690
and you're comfortable and you have a
roof over your head.

2171
01:35:38,691 --> 01:35:39,590
And you're better,
you know,

2172
01:35:39,620 --> 01:35:41,150
you're doing better than you want it to
be.

2173
01:35:41,150 --> 01:35:43,010
A black guy though.
Look,

2174
01:35:43,011 --> 01:35:46,250
I take a black afternoon any day of the
week and the afternoon only for the

2175
01:35:46,251 --> 01:35:50,030
afternoon when I go full time out of the
test drive at first.

2176
01:35:51,170 --> 01:35:53,150
But you got,
I mean everybody,

2177
01:35:53,390 --> 01:35:56,300
even racist people will like Yell Racist
Shit in their front yard and they'll

2178
01:35:56,301 --> 01:35:58,910
slam the door and go practice the
moonwalk in their living room.

2179
01:35:58,911 --> 01:36:01,490
Like everybody I think wants to be a
little bit black.

2180
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:05,000
Wow.
If you could have a pint of black blood

2181
01:36:05,001 --> 01:36:07,340
right now are African American?
Yeah.

2182
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:10,190
Yeah.
You seem a little tribal.

2183
01:36:10,670 --> 01:36:12,560
Tribal.
Yeah Bro.

2184
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:16,620
Have you ever seen yourself
here?

2185
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:18,890
Fucking the closest thing we have to
like.

2186
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:23,570
Yeah man,
I think so blatantly obvious.

2187
01:36:23,571 --> 01:36:25,310
Dude.
You got dead animals in here,

2188
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,710
Bro.
You learn to do a drum bro.

2189
01:36:30,950 --> 01:36:32,830
You can live on any continent you want,
man.

2190
01:36:33,140 --> 01:36:34,820
Oh,
in a heartbeat,

2191
01:36:34,821 --> 01:36:37,650
man.
Diovan.

2192
01:36:37,660 --> 01:36:40,430
Ladies and gentlemen.
Yeah man.

2193
01:36:40,431 --> 01:36:42,170
I can't believe Steven Tyler was in
here.

2194
01:36:42,290 --> 01:36:47,290
He reminds me of where you are
sitting right where you are.

2195
01:36:57,100 --> 01:36:59,670
That was man when I was in high school
and that song would come on.

2196
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:01,410
You'd be like,
yes,

2197
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:03,460
fuck yeah.

2198
01:37:05,780 --> 01:37:07,460
He rolled down the window.
Yell out.

2199
01:37:07,570 --> 01:37:08,650
Oh,
I could imagine that.

2200
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:12,650
If we ever were to pay.
Do you ever have.

2201
01:37:12,651 --> 01:37:13,484
Well,
you never had a toupee.

2202
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:17,180
I'd like to wear one right now.
I'd wear a big red one.

2203
01:37:17,780 --> 01:37:21,350
No big bushy one.
What do you listen when you plan?

2204
01:37:22,730 --> 01:37:25,490
What is that?
Oh,

2205
01:37:25,860 --> 01:37:27,560
but you got two things going on in the
background.

2206
01:37:27,830 --> 01:37:29,480
He fucked it up.
Porn probably opened up.

2207
01:37:29,481 --> 01:37:34,481
It sounds like you gotta you gotta back.
He's a human failure in the.

2208
01:37:34,670 --> 01:37:35,810
Yeah,
there's voices,

2209
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:40,500
the music video,
but what's all the talking girl talk and

2210
01:37:40,570 --> 01:37:42,680
music video.
How much accoutrements to Steven Tyler

2211
01:37:42,690 --> 01:37:43,491
hipbone.
Wait a minute.

2212
01:37:43,491 --> 01:37:46,790
In sweet emotions is a girl talking
music video.

2213
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:49,730
Oh.
Oh,

2214
01:37:49,731 --> 01:37:51,850
okay.
I was so confused because it's not just

2215
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:54,320
the song
number.

2216
01:37:54,530 --> 01:37:56,480
Loving and elevator.
Yeah.

2217
01:37:57,290 --> 01:37:59,790
This is a great song though,
man.

2218
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:03,630
Look at Joe Perry looking all sexy.
What year was this?

2219
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:06,570
Wow.
Ninety one,

2220
01:38:06,571 --> 01:38:11,050
but I don't know if that's right.
Is it could have been for you here,

2221
01:38:11,051 --> 01:38:13,170
man.
He always has like everything.

2222
01:38:13,171 --> 01:38:15,870
If you're walking out the door,
I feel like Steven Tyler has it all on,

2223
01:38:15,871 --> 01:38:19,490
you know,
Bandanas and beads and shit.

2224
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:21,040
Scarfs,
necklace,

2225
01:38:21,041 --> 01:38:23,190
his coat,
everything bro.

2226
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:27,240
Everything man.
Now I would trade.

2227
01:38:27,241 --> 01:38:29,220
I would give anything to be Steven.
Tyler.

2228
01:38:30,150 --> 01:38:32,400
Does he seem like he's had a really neat
life?

2229
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:34,110
Oh yeah,
man.

2230
01:38:34,350 --> 01:38:36,110
Yeah.
Cool.

2231
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:41,070
He's had a wild life and the fact that
he's 70 and he's still going strong.

2232
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:46,140
He's got an artificial knee.
No way they'd replaced his knee.

2233
01:38:46,350 --> 01:38:50,130
Did he show it to you and they're going
to replace his other one apparently too,

2234
01:38:50,131 --> 01:38:51,630
and I asked him,
I'm like,

2235
01:38:51,631 --> 01:38:52,740
you're walking around fine.

2236
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:53,281
He's like,
yeah,

2237
01:38:53,281 --> 01:38:54,230
well they're gonna.
They're gonna.

2238
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:55,170
Replace this one till.
I'm like,

2239
01:38:55,171 --> 01:38:58,500
you gotta like look into stem cells,
regenerative medicine.

2240
01:38:58,501 --> 01:39:02,590
You might not have to replace that.
So I turned him onto some doctors are

2241
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:04,110
any.
Are you doing some of that?

2242
01:39:04,111 --> 01:39:05,220
You did.
So what have you done?

2243
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:07,140
You've done stem cells?
Yeah,

2244
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:11,370
I had a full length tear in my rotator
cuff.

2245
01:39:11,490 --> 01:39:13,830
It's gone.
The shit works.

2246
01:39:13,950 --> 01:39:15,270
It works.
One hundred percent.

2247
01:39:15,330 --> 01:39:17,940
How much is it for a couple.
It's not cheap.

2248
01:39:18,630 --> 01:39:21,690
The thing is they can do it better
overseas currently.

2249
01:39:21,970 --> 01:39:23,160
They can do right here.
Yeah.

2250
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:26,460
If you go to a doctor right here,
there's a lot of limitations,

2251
01:39:26,461 --> 01:39:28,920
but they're.
They're doing things in Panama and I had

2252
01:39:28,921 --> 01:39:31,560
this guy on with Mel Gibson.
Dr Neil Riordan.

2253
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:34,380
Mel Gibson's dad was 92 and he was on
death's door,

2254
01:39:34,381 --> 01:39:38,190
couldn't walk in a wheelchair.
Now he's 100 walking around all stem

2255
01:39:38,191 --> 01:39:38,940
cells.

2256
01:39:38,940 --> 01:39:41,750
They just juiced them up with that shit.
They hit you with an ivy.

2257
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:44,310
They put it into your injuries,
regenerates tissue.

2258
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:46,500
Now they're doing some stuff here in
America.

2259
01:39:46,501 --> 01:39:50,160
They're doing some tests on something
called exosomes and exosomes are

2260
01:39:50,161 --> 01:39:53,880
apparently the part of stem cells that
regenerate tissue.

2261
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:56,850
They're able to isolate those and put
those in injuries.

2262
01:39:56,851 --> 01:39:58,920
Now they like.
They keep getting better and better at

2263
01:39:58,921 --> 01:40:01,530
it,
like we're just a few generations away

2264
01:40:01,531 --> 01:40:03,480
from that.
Being able to completely regenerate

2265
01:40:03,481 --> 01:40:06,750
parts of your body.
Do you ever feel like a little bit like

2266
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:11,730
bomb that you might not be in that
generation that makes that now that cut,

2267
01:40:11,940 --> 01:40:14,070
how can we be bummed out that we're in
this life?

2268
01:40:14,071 --> 01:40:17,550
This life is amazing.
This is the greatest life in terms of

2269
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:21,840
maybe looking at this.
The world that we are in today is

2270
01:40:21,841 --> 01:40:25,180
without a doubt the best time to be
alive in the.

2271
01:40:25,410 --> 01:40:28,140
Obviously they thought this way in the
19 sixties.

2272
01:40:28,410 --> 01:40:28,951
They're like,
man,

2273
01:40:28,951 --> 01:40:30,920
this is the greatest time to be alive.
Now,

2274
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:32,280
if I had to tell,
tell you,

2275
01:40:32,281 --> 01:40:33,750
hey man,
you want to go back to the sixties?

2276
01:40:33,751 --> 01:40:37,770
You like what?
Drum brakes and fucking shitty stereos

2277
01:40:37,771 --> 01:40:42,010
and can't add power steering races on
the civil rights movements.

2278
01:40:42,020 --> 01:40:43,950
Still Getting hosed down.
No,

2279
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:46,080
no.
I'm not going to live in 1963.

2280
01:40:46,150 --> 01:40:48,870
Yeah,
but back then in [inaudible] 63,

2281
01:40:48,871 --> 01:40:49,321
they're like,
man,

2282
01:40:49,321 --> 01:40:53,230
we got it made refrigeration there.
So when that came out,

2283
01:40:53,590 --> 01:40:57,370
color TV baby,
there was site looking at tv 12 inches,

2284
01:40:57,371 --> 01:41:00,310
bitch.
Fucking your wife on top of it.

2285
01:41:01,830 --> 01:41:04,210
He could do those things are cabinets.
Yeah.

2286
01:41:04,270 --> 01:41:06,400
Remember those things were giant.
Those tvs,

2287
01:41:06,401 --> 01:41:09,460
they would be in those big wooden
fucking boxes.

2288
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:14,730
You'd open up the door closet.
See the TV in the back was all hot

2289
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:18,700
fucking thing going.
If you touch something,

2290
01:41:18,701 --> 01:41:19,630
you get electric.
Yeah.

2291
01:41:19,631 --> 01:41:22,300
That shit was wild.
It was like tubes back there that would

2292
01:41:22,301 --> 01:41:23,800
replace the tube.
Yeah,

2293
01:41:23,801 --> 01:41:24,634
they have like a 600.

2294
01:41:28,030 --> 01:41:33,030
They got hot when I'm ran on gas.
I think my buddy had a smaller unit and

2295
01:41:33,311 --> 01:41:36,310
that was a modern one.
My grandparents had one that was in a

2296
01:41:36,311 --> 01:41:37,660
cabinet.
Yes.

2297
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:42,640
And the TV would die and when the TV
died they put a new TV on top of the

2298
01:41:42,641 --> 01:41:47,641
cabinet where the old TV set 60 minutes.
All it played was 60 minutes to fill a

2299
01:41:49,410 --> 01:41:50,560
void.
That motherfucker.

2300
01:41:50,890 --> 01:41:53,440
Holy Shit.
Introducing revolutionary big picture

2301
01:41:53,441 --> 01:41:57,040
color television.
That was like some rear projection shit.

2302
01:41:57,070 --> 01:41:58,870
Those always looked terrible where there
were big.

2303
01:41:59,050 --> 01:42:01,120
Those are people had cocaine and that
were fucking,

2304
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:05,650
you know.
Did you say that the cocaine movie

2305
01:42:05,651 --> 01:42:10,000
American made with Tom Cruise
[inaudible] oh,

2306
01:42:10,001 --> 01:42:11,620
it's a great movie man.
Oh wait.

2307
01:42:11,621 --> 01:42:13,900
Where he does all this stuff down in
Louisiana and he's running the planes.

2308
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:15,340
I did see that.
What'd you say?

2309
01:42:15,341 --> 01:42:17,800
June 25 inch TV.
Is that what that is?

2310
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:20,440
And everybody's talking about how big it
is and that crazy.

2311
01:42:20,441 --> 01:42:22,930
He looks bigger.
It looks bigger than 25 inches.

2312
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:24,490
That guy,
they got a midget to do that.

2313
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:26,620
Got a little tiny guy to do that
commercial.

2314
01:42:26,621 --> 01:42:31,621
Look at tiny fella and he's in the
background is on a step stool.

2315
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:34,690
He's way in the background.
Did they?

2316
01:42:34,691 --> 01:42:37,360
I'm sorry,
what was something that you remember

2317
01:42:37,361 --> 01:42:38,890
that where you were like,
Holy Shit.

2318
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:40,570
Answer machines.
Yeah.

2319
01:42:40,690 --> 01:42:43,240
I remember answering machines were so
crazy.

2320
01:42:43,241 --> 01:42:43,841
I was like,
wait a minute,

2321
01:42:43,841 --> 01:42:46,000
someone can leave a message.
I don't even have to be home.

2322
01:42:46,150 --> 01:42:48,910
And then there was a code that you could
call in.

2323
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:52,000
You would call in and you would hit like
pound one,

2324
01:42:52,001 --> 01:42:53,970
two,
three or some shit and your answering

2325
01:42:53,980 --> 01:42:58,980
machine would play back your message.
Remember that you could call remotely

2326
01:42:59,470 --> 01:43:00,610
ability.
Yo the Yo,

2327
01:43:00,670 --> 01:43:01,810
I got the mushrooms.

2328
01:43:01,820 --> 01:43:05,580
Yeah,
meet me at 3:00 at the 7:11.

2329
01:43:05,620 --> 01:43:06,670
You're like,
Holy Shit.

2330
01:43:06,671 --> 01:43:08,560
It's on.
Is that answering machine right there,

2331
01:43:08,561 --> 01:43:09,790
Jamie?
Yeah.

2332
01:43:09,970 --> 01:43:10,960
Yeah,
that's what it was like.

2333
01:43:11,230 --> 01:43:15,620
It had two cassettes to outgoing
cassette and any common consent and

2334
01:43:15,660 --> 01:43:18,290
you'd fuck up and erase a message.
Yeah,

2335
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:21,340
and you would play a song on your
outgoing,

2336
01:43:21,790 --> 01:43:23,560
you know,
it'd be like your favorite song.

2337
01:43:23,561 --> 01:43:25,150
We'll be playing and he'd be like,
Yo,

2338
01:43:25,151 --> 01:43:28,090
what's up Joe?
Message,

2339
01:43:28,450 --> 01:43:33,450
you know I'm all cool over here and shit
down,

2340
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:40,030
down,
down,

2341
01:43:40,030 --> 01:43:40,541
down.
Oh,

2342
01:43:40,541 --> 01:43:42,940
that was a mini cassette.
That's what you were bawling.

2343
01:43:43,390 --> 01:43:45,280
Dual tape.
Answering machine.

2344
01:43:45,281 --> 01:43:47,170
Woo.
Those tiny little tapes,

2345
01:43:47,620 --> 01:43:49,150
motherfucker.
I'm going digital.

2346
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:50,530
Yeah,
and just fuck a girl.

2347
01:43:50,531 --> 01:43:52,550
Run on top of that.
Then break it.

2348
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:56,480
Remember when you hear it go off beep
and you could.

2349
01:43:56,510 --> 01:43:59,240
You could listen for someone like,
hey man,

2350
01:43:59,390 --> 01:44:00,990
it's my.
You don't call me back.

2351
01:44:00,990 --> 01:44:01,611
And I'm like,
boy,

2352
01:44:01,611 --> 01:44:04,610
I'm glad I didn't pick that up.
You can screen the calls.

2353
01:44:04,611 --> 01:44:09,200
Remember that screen calls before that
you just had to take your chances every

2354
01:44:09,201 --> 01:44:11,510
time you picked up the phone,
every time you picked up the phone you

2355
01:44:11,511 --> 01:44:13,130
were taking a chance.
It could be mom,

2356
01:44:13,131 --> 01:44:14,480
it could be the.
It could be anything.

2357
01:44:14,481 --> 01:44:17,570
It could be anybody.
People would call your house late at

2358
01:44:17,570 --> 01:44:20,540
night and parents would get pissed.
Who the fuck's calling me at 11:00 at

2359
01:44:20,541 --> 01:44:21,560
night?
Yeah.

2360
01:44:21,561 --> 01:44:23,780
We call the no,
we call the movie theaters and listen to

2361
01:44:23,781 --> 01:44:25,970
that voice message once the call waiting
came out,

2362
01:44:25,971 --> 01:44:28,730
you know,
so we'd listen to that long message from

2363
01:44:28,731 --> 01:44:33,560
the,
from the welcome to movie is 7:30 7:35

2364
01:44:33,561 --> 01:44:35,180
and 9:00 PM.
Yeah,

2365
01:44:35,181 --> 01:44:37,820
that's right.
You would call up to find what time shit

2366
01:44:37,821 --> 01:44:39,770
was playing pink Cadillac,
uh,

2367
01:44:39,830 --> 01:44:42,080
will be eight,
10 and 10.

2368
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:43,430
Thirty PM.
Yeah.

2369
01:44:43,431 --> 01:44:47,330
You gotta listen to that whole thing to
fucking remember it or write it down.

2370
01:44:47,331 --> 01:44:50,180
Write it down.
That was the only time you could find

2371
01:44:50,181 --> 01:44:52,880
out what was playing in a fucking movies
or you get the newspaper,

2372
01:44:53,310 --> 01:44:55,090
go to the newspaper,
find out that.

2373
01:44:55,730 --> 01:44:57,860
And you trusted it and then you went
there.

2374
01:44:58,040 --> 01:44:59,090
Yeah.
Yeah.

2375
01:44:59,091 --> 01:45:01,480
You went there.
Did.

2376
01:45:01,510 --> 01:45:03,740
That was just a few years ago.
That's what's crazy.

2377
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:07,480
That's unfathomable today.
If there was no more cell phones,

2378
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:10,790
no more Internet on your phone.
It was unfathomable when there's no

2379
01:45:10,791 --> 01:45:13,040
turning back.
What is going to happen with us.

2380
01:45:13,130 --> 01:45:17,390
That's also no turning back that we
don't have now that we just were used to

2381
01:45:17,391 --> 01:45:19,130
not having it.
So it's no big deal.

2382
01:45:19,131 --> 01:45:21,860
Like back in the sixties,
nobody thought about cell phones and the

2383
01:45:21,861 --> 01:45:24,830
Internet because they didn't have it.
It wasn't something they missed.

2384
01:45:25,130 --> 01:45:26,630
Right.
Let's come in.

2385
01:45:27,980 --> 01:45:32,710
I know what I think what some of it is.
I think it's um,

2386
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:37,850
just like complete transparency where
it's like through people's eyes you have

2387
01:45:37,970 --> 01:45:40,400
some sort of thing that can,
you know exactly,

2388
01:45:40,401 --> 01:45:42,320
like if they're being genuine or what
their thoughts are.

2389
01:45:42,321 --> 01:45:43,400
You know.
I think so,

2390
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:44,060
yeah.
I think,

2391
01:45:44,060 --> 01:45:46,940
I think that's definitely coming,
but they have the ability to read each

2392
01:45:46,941 --> 01:45:50,930
other's minds is coming for sure because
we need something to trump like people

2393
01:45:50,931 --> 01:45:54,890
who are just full of shit full of shit.
Yes.

2394
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:57,590
And people who lie and people who don't
want good,

2395
01:45:57,680 --> 01:45:59,030
you know,
where people are too greedy.

2396
01:45:59,031 --> 01:46:00,980
We just needed something to do.
Something about that.

2397
01:46:01,610 --> 01:46:02,780
Yeah.
Um,

2398
01:46:02,870 --> 01:46:05,330
I think there's gonna come a time where
you could definitely read people's

2399
01:46:05,331 --> 01:46:06,141
minds,
you know,

2400
01:46:06,141 --> 01:46:08,090
they're already figured out a way to
implant memories.

2401
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:10,940
Did you read that Shit about that?
They've implanted memory.

2402
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:13,820
They successfully implanted a memory in
something.

2403
01:46:14,030 --> 01:46:15,830
What was the thing?
The implanted and then do you remember?

2404
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:20,130
I think yeah,
some animal just say figured out a way a

2405
01:46:20,131 --> 01:46:21,920
rat can do it.
Successfully.

2406
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:26,690
Implant a memory.
So it's going to come a point in time

2407
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:29,190
where it's like someone said,
this is like

2408
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:32,320
a snail.
Yeah.

2409
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:33,990
I'm not buying that.

2410
01:46:36,580 --> 01:46:39,380
I'm going to wait till the next year.
Yeah.

2411
01:46:39,381 --> 01:46:43,160
I'm super skeptical.
Scientist Transplant memories between

2412
01:46:43,161 --> 01:46:47,900
sea snails via injection experiment
shows some memories are encoded in

2413
01:46:47,901 --> 01:46:50,010
molecules that form part

2414
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:52,350
of an organism's genetic machinery.
Researchers say,

2415
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:54,480
okay,
I'm too stupid to know whether or not

2416
01:46:54,481 --> 01:46:55,860
they're telling the truth,
so I'm going to believe them.

2417
01:46:56,910 --> 01:46:58,530
Don't believe.
What does this in this is in the

2418
01:46:58,531 --> 01:47:00,050
Guardian.
Yeah,

2419
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:01,530
yeah,
yeah.

2420
01:47:01,830 --> 01:47:04,260
Well they.
They had that therapy now that emdr.

2421
01:47:04,261 --> 01:47:05,640
Have you ever done that?
No.

2422
01:47:05,730 --> 01:47:07,020
What's that?
Where it's like they.

2423
01:47:07,021 --> 01:47:09,270
You hold on these panels and they like.
It's therapy.

2424
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:12,320
It's therapy and it activates both sides
of your brain while you're like

2425
01:47:12,330 --> 01:47:17,330
remembering old things and then you like
replace those old fears are scary parts

2426
01:47:17,851 --> 01:47:21,540
of you with like new,
like new parts,

2427
01:47:21,541 --> 01:47:26,541
like new ideas and new memories kind of.
And I've gone to it a couple times,

2428
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:29,410
probably about maybe 10 times.
And uh,

2429
01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:31,620
yeah,
you go back into your thoughts and it's

2430
01:47:31,650 --> 01:47:33,390
while it's activating both sides of your
brain,

2431
01:47:33,391 --> 01:47:36,330
you can do stuff to your childhood that
you weren't able to do when you were a

2432
01:47:36,331 --> 01:47:38,250
kid because only one part of your brain
was developing.

2433
01:47:38,610 --> 01:47:39,900
That's what they say.
Huh?

2434
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:41,730
What did you go back to?
What'd you do it for?

2435
01:47:42,210 --> 01:47:46,090
How did it just for like,
like maybe like for like probably a

2436
01:47:46,110 --> 01:47:48,960
father figure stuff.
Not having somebody to stand up for me

2437
01:47:48,961 --> 01:47:50,580
or feeling like,
you know,

2438
01:47:50,581 --> 01:47:54,000
certain times in my life where I didn't
have support,

2439
01:47:54,270 --> 01:47:55,470
you know?
And I felt like I was alone.

2440
01:47:55,471 --> 01:47:58,920
Like you go back and like you plug
somebody in there with you that is

2441
01:47:58,921 --> 01:48:01,890
supportive.
And so while you're talking about it and

2442
01:48:01,891 --> 01:48:03,570
this thing's open up both sides of your
head,

2443
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:05,640
it can,
it can help.

2444
01:48:05,820 --> 01:48:09,300
And what does it help with the going
back over that stuff from your

2445
01:48:09,301 --> 01:48:10,810
childhood,
what's good about doing that?

2446
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:13,320
It replaces that memory with the new
memory.

2447
01:48:13,530 --> 01:48:14,170
Right?
But,

2448
01:48:14,170 --> 01:48:16,020
but isn't that memory even though it's
negative,

2449
01:48:16,021 --> 01:48:20,310
beneficial to you because you understand
why it was bad and then once someday

2450
01:48:20,550 --> 01:48:23,580
when you have kids you have learned from
the mistakes too.

2451
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:27,030
Good point.
Like you don't want to replace a bad

2452
01:48:27,031 --> 01:48:31,150
childhood with a good one in your brain
because he didn't have a good childhood.

2453
01:48:31,170 --> 01:48:33,960
Right?
Like it's okay to have a bad childhood.

2454
01:48:33,961 --> 01:48:35,180
Like you've gone through that.
Yeah,

2455
01:48:35,370 --> 01:48:38,420
I mean it's not.
I would think that for someone who's

2456
01:48:38,430 --> 01:48:41,790
dealing with something extremely
traumatic like childhood rape or

2457
01:48:41,791 --> 01:48:44,280
something like that,
then maybe it makes sense.

2458
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:45,930
Yeah.
Violence,

2459
01:48:45,990 --> 01:48:48,360
things along those lines.
Something that's like haunts you all the

2460
01:48:48,361 --> 01:48:51,420
time that's messing with you,
messing with your life today.

2461
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:54,690
But like does your childhood messed with
your life today?

2462
01:48:54,970 --> 01:48:55,920
No.
No.

2463
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:57,630
So why fuck with it?
Yeah,

2464
01:48:58,020 --> 01:48:58,890
that's a good point.
I mean,

2465
01:48:58,891 --> 01:49:00,060
I never even thought about that,
I guess.

2466
01:49:00,061 --> 01:49:01,550
Yeah,
maybe that stuff for people that's

2467
01:49:01,650 --> 01:49:04,150
extremely traumatic,
but got through like a,

2468
01:49:04,570 --> 01:49:05,550
a,
you know,

2469
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:07,500
a shot,
an Arrow and fucking hit somebody on

2470
01:49:07,501 --> 01:49:08,334
accident or.

2471
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:09,181
No,
I didn't,

2472
01:49:09,181 --> 01:49:10,590
but if somebody did.
Oh yeah,

2473
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:13,470
yeah,
I killed an animal with a knife or

2474
01:49:13,471 --> 01:49:15,780
something bad or you know,
somebody killed my parents or something,

2475
01:49:16,580 --> 01:49:18,500
then you could go back.
Yes.

2476
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:19,381
Yeah.
Yeah.

2477
01:49:19,381 --> 01:49:21,300
I think that's probably a good point.
Yeah.

2478
01:49:21,870 --> 01:49:23,310
Yeah.
I guess some of this stuff,

2479
01:49:23,311 --> 01:49:26,550
it's like some people it's debilitating,
you know,

2480
01:49:26,551 --> 01:49:28,560
their childhood,
the trauma is so bad,

2481
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:32,490
it haunts them and it keeps them from
improving and growing as a person.

2482
01:49:32,550 --> 01:49:34,320
Yeah,
like really horrible shit.

2483
01:49:35,250 --> 01:49:37,230
But for us,
I think it's fuel.

2484
01:49:37,231 --> 01:49:41,490
I think the goofiness of your and my
childhood and the bad,

2485
01:49:41,670 --> 01:49:44,520
it's sort of led you to become a
comedian really.

2486
01:49:44,521 --> 01:49:47,990
I really think that you do need the.
I mean

2487
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:51,130
we've talked about Joey Joey,
he found his mother dead on the kitchen

2488
01:49:51,131 --> 01:49:55,960
floor when he was 13 years old on acid.
Jody has been through everything.

2489
01:49:55,990 --> 01:49:59,070
He's seen it all.
I'm going to think that there's

2490
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:01,450
something to that that makes him so
fucking funny,

2491
01:50:01,940 --> 01:50:05,800
you know,
if you replaced all that childhood would

2492
01:50:05,801 --> 01:50:08,560
like the perfect loving parents that
were,

2493
01:50:08,561 --> 01:50:11,320
you know,
super engaged and there for them all the

2494
01:50:11,321 --> 01:50:14,740
time and very supportive and an amazing
neighborhood with no violence,

2495
01:50:14,741 --> 01:50:18,760
no crime and all this diversity and
everybody's super progressive.

2496
01:50:19,150 --> 01:50:21,940
You're not going to get a Joey Diaz.
He'd be working at a cafeteria,

2497
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:25,210
you know what I'm saying?
Or a library and he'd be one of the

2498
01:50:25,211 --> 01:50:27,160
hottest women.
They are probably two at the cafeteria,

2499
01:50:27,990 --> 01:50:29,810
you know,
it's something really special about him

2500
01:50:29,811 --> 01:50:32,640
and that's been a blessing to meeting
him is that like he'll call me salons

2501
01:50:32,650 --> 01:50:33,760
and just like check in on me.

2502
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:34,750
Yeah,
he does that all the time.

2503
01:50:34,980 --> 01:50:36,790
Calls me every day.
That's so crazy.

2504
01:50:36,820 --> 01:50:37,780
It's gone.
Tell you I love you.

2505
01:50:38,650 --> 01:50:42,850
I love you too man.
But it's like the first time he does it,

2506
01:50:42,851 --> 01:50:44,770
you know,
I guess me just like not trusting

2507
01:50:44,771 --> 01:50:45,281
things,
you know,

2508
01:50:45,281 --> 01:50:48,580
like my own internal thing sometimes.
But then after like the 10th time you're

2509
01:50:48,581 --> 01:50:49,420
like,
damn man,

2510
01:50:49,421 --> 01:50:50,620
he's legit.
Yeah.

2511
01:50:50,740 --> 01:50:52,580
Like this guy really cares.
It's pretty cool.

2512
01:50:52,581 --> 01:50:54,460
Well,
he doesn't text either thinks it's

2513
01:50:54,461 --> 01:50:56,390
impersonal and I think he's right.
You know,

2514
01:50:56,430 --> 01:50:58,210
he likes to call you talk to him.
The phone.

2515
01:50:58,450 --> 01:50:59,720
Yeah.
Yeah.

2516
01:50:59,790 --> 01:51:01,120
I wonder what the future is going to be
like.

2517
01:51:01,121 --> 01:51:03,670
Man.
I feel sad if we get so far away from

2518
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:08,020
each other that we don't know.
Remember what it's like to have.

2519
01:51:08,710 --> 01:51:11,110
Like I feel like a smile is going to be
like in a museum one day,

2520
01:51:11,111 --> 01:51:11,560
you know?

2521
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:14,020
Nah,
I think we'll still have smiles,

2522
01:51:14,330 --> 01:51:18,400
but we might get to a point where human
interaction is all done digitally.

2523
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:21,400
That could happen,
but I think.

2524
01:51:21,820 --> 01:51:24,010
I think it's just,
we're just going to get used to it.

2525
01:51:24,070 --> 01:51:27,160
Just like we're used to this life and
we're not living in caves anymore.

2526
01:51:27,220 --> 01:51:28,790
Those people that lived in caves like,
oh,

2527
01:51:28,791 --> 01:51:30,450
he's fucking.
Yeah man.

2528
01:51:30,451 --> 01:51:32,590
I never want to leave this as a way to
go.

2529
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:35,850
It was fucking hideous for their cars.
Airplanes.

2530
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:39,250
Like when you live in the cave,
there was no going to the Bahamas.

2531
01:51:39,700 --> 01:51:41,380
You,
you're not going to the Bahamas bitch.

2532
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:43,480
You live in a cave.
And this is where you live.

2533
01:51:44,450 --> 01:51:47,350
You can't go on vacation to Italy.
The fuck out of here,

2534
01:51:47,351 --> 01:51:50,050
there's no vacation and you live in a
cave.

2535
01:51:50,530 --> 01:51:53,890
If you want to take your fucking family,
you want to take your family through the

2536
01:51:53,891 --> 01:51:55,870
woods,
you're going to get eaten by wolves.

2537
01:51:56,610 --> 01:51:59,130
Aren't gonna.
Make it every pickney it didn't,

2538
01:51:59,140 --> 01:52:03,540
just violent death.
He went from raspberries to just spray

2539
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:07,030
him blood all over each other.
And I think that as time goes on,

2540
01:52:07,090 --> 01:52:10,660
like this is going to be the,
we're going to look back or someone is

2541
01:52:10,661 --> 01:52:12,550
going something that's different than
us.

2542
01:52:12,551 --> 01:52:16,390
Now it's going to look back on us.
Like look at these dopes with

2543
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:19,540
antibiotics and taking vitamins and
shit.

2544
01:52:19,541 --> 01:52:21,940
These fucking morons come in on each
other.

2545
01:52:22,510 --> 01:52:25,210
Loads each other's face because they saw
the video,

2546
01:52:25,610 --> 01:52:26,500
you know,
like what do they do?

2547
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:30,250
Sit at home jacket off like some fucking
adderall up monkey.

2548
01:52:37,450 --> 01:52:38,800
Taking a break,
drinking milk,

2549
01:52:38,801 --> 01:52:41,890
trying to go back for round three.
He jerk off three times in a day.

2550
01:52:41,980 --> 01:52:44,380
Oh I can't do that kind of stuff.
Makes me sick to my stomach.

2551
01:52:44,381 --> 01:52:46,100
Never that I've done it.
And I've never

2552
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:48,080
been horny.
It's almost like I'm trying to see if I

2553
01:52:48,081 --> 01:52:49,200
could do it.
It's like,

2554
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:51,380
you know,
capital and stuff.

2555
01:52:51,381 --> 01:52:52,490
Yeah.
You're getting Kaplan.

2556
01:52:52,670 --> 01:52:54,950
Was He Olympic athlete?
Oh,

2557
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:56,450
telling me the guy from.
Welcome back,

2558
01:52:56,451 --> 01:52:58,690
Kotter.
I'm thinking of somebody else there

2559
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:02,990
thinking.
Who are you thinking of?

2560
01:53:03,290 --> 01:53:04,730
I don't know.
Michael Spitz.

2561
01:53:04,731 --> 01:53:06,890
Maybe somebody who's against the Olympic
guy.

2562
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:07,940
Yeah,
he's a swimmer.

2563
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:08,833
Yeah.
Yeah,

2564
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:09,730
yeah.
Somebody that could,

2565
01:53:09,731 --> 01:53:12,080
you know,
somebody that just just kept doing it

2566
01:53:12,081 --> 01:53:13,130
over and over again.
I get,

2567
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:17,140
I'm not even that good at this.
I don't know.

2568
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:19,590
Sex is fucking retarded sometimes.
Dude.

2569
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:22,250
It's also crazy.
Just banging into somebody until

2570
01:53:22,251 --> 01:53:24,080
somebody comes.
Who's Gabe Kaplan?

2571
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:25,280
Look at him.
Handsome bastard.

2572
01:53:25,460 --> 01:53:29,030
He became a poker player.
Became a professional poker player.

2573
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:30,530
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

2574
01:53:31,310 --> 01:53:32,690
The avant.
I gotta wrap this bitch up.

2575
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:34,100
I got an anecdote.
Enter enduro man.

2576
01:53:34,130 --> 01:53:34,640
Look at him.
Go.

2577
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:35,421
He looks terrible.
Dude.

2578
01:53:35,421 --> 01:53:37,220
Thanks for having me here.
I love your new place.

2579
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,091
Thanks brother.
