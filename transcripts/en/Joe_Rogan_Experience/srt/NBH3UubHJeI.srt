1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,560
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,850
We were talking a little bit earlier,

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,730
how much of your life
revolves around on it?

4
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:08,911
Yeah.

5
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:09,744
There you go.

6
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,730
How much year of life revolves
around the pleasure that food,

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,050
booze,

8
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,693
you know,

9
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,270
before the podcast started about making
the choice between booze and food.

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,350
Like if you could eat whatever the fuck
you want it to be healthy and live til

11
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:30,660
you're fucking 90 and all that shit or,

12
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,450
but you couldn't drink or you could drink,

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,291
but he can't eat shit,

14
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,660
you gotta eat cardboard and
the fucking grape leaves.

15
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:37,531
Oh,

16
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:37,891
okay,

17
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:38,281
well,

18
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:39,230
I'm going to work great.

19
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,370
Please give cardboard and fucking grass.

20
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,040
I truly believe that living without
good food and living without,

21
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,760
uh,

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,390
I mean,

23
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,800
if you're going to survive,

24
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,190
you're,

25
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:50,701
you know,

26
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:51,311
if you live in,

27
00:00:51,311 --> 00:00:53,760
in the walking dead and you
got to shoot deer and shit,

28
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,140
that's all well and good,

29
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:56,940
but we're talking about
in this day and age,

30
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:57,731
I'm talking to you.

31
00:00:57,731 --> 00:00:58,710
You have a choice.

32
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,740
If you have to make a choice between I
can eat my favorite shit or I can drink

33
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:04,660
booze and,

34
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,090
and,

35
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,740
and have the added sort
of crank that that give.

36
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,271
Well,

37
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:11,350
what I was going to say was that the,

38
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:12,570
the idea of,

39
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:12,870
you know,

40
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,470
subsistence living is all although
frightening that food is delicious.

41
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,510
Eating deer over a campfire.

42
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,310
That's a really yummy tasting food,

43
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:20,480
right?

44
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,590
If you're saying like shitty food,

45
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:25,260
like cardboard tasting bland food,

46
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,080
that's a sergeant.

47
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,600
The enjoyment of the day in my opinion,

48
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,200
my meal with my family I think is uh,

49
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:37,090
I one of my favorite things in life and
that sounds like it sounds uttered like

50
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:37,973
utter horse shit,

51
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,913
the people.

52
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:39,960
But um,

53
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,140
the,

54
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,710
the real idea is like sitting down with
your kids and having a laugh and having

55
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:44,544
a meal.

56
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,670
I think that that whole process is,

57
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,360
it's very important and
nutrition is very important,

58
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:55,140
but for me the taste is
very important as well.

59
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,720
I think it's important to eat
things that are delicious.

60
00:01:57,721 --> 00:01:57,960
It fee,

61
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,650
it's like a,

62
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,130
it's a part of like a
pleasurable aspect of life.

63
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,490
And so if I had to choose honestly between
drinking booze and eating delicious

64
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:10,461
food,

65
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:11,900
I would go with delicious food.

66
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:16,360
I think delicious food is more important
because I've experienced the booze and

67
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,780
I understand the lessons,

68
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,140
the lessons of the dropping
of the inhibition and the
good aspects of alcohol,

69
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,600
which are often overlooked by people
who just can't handle alcohol.

70
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,340
Yeah.

71
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,000
You know,

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,421
like we were,

73
00:02:28,421 --> 00:02:30,940
we were talking before the
podcast started about not,

74
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,050
this is a fee.

75
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:32,883
There's certain

76
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,540
level of trust that you have or someone
is willing to get drunk with you.

77
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,100
Like you know that guy's demons,

78
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,711
they're all,

79
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:41,760
they're all right there.

80
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,270
Five or six Jack and cokes,

81
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,313
you know,

82
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,720
telling a story about
Tiawana and you're like,

83
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:50,010
Holy Shit,

84
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,193
how did,

85
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,043
Whoa,

86
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,340
what did you tell your mom?

87
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,050
Well,

88
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:54,690
climbed into my,

89
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:55,231
you know what I mean?

90
00:02:55,231 --> 00:03:00,231
It's like you get to know a person and
you realize that there's no benefit in

91
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:03,100
hiding all that shit from PBL love anyway.

92
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,840
There's a benefit and telling them,

93
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:09,910
right and the sort of camaraderie that
ensues from those drunk and conversations

94
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:10,411
of,

95
00:03:10,411 --> 00:03:15,411
of complete and total honesty where
the alcohol does a purpose instead of

96
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,920
inhibiting you and making
you make shitty decisions.

97
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,190
The alcohol releases you from this,

98
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:25,210
this idea that a anything
makes any sense whatsoever.

99
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,440
And you start telling the truth or you
start expressing yourself or you start

100
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,320
looking at things from more
rural relax perspective,

101
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,370
even temporarily or that thought
gets planted in your mind.

102
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:41,230
And then you just have more of a
sense of friendliness the next day.

103
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:41,830
Like,

104
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,663
you know,

105
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,820
oftentimes it's,

106
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,370
it's little encounters.

107
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:46,980
It's steer us and uh,

108
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,350
like I remember this and the
Anthony Robbins quote who,

109
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:51,060
uh,

110
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:51,910
believe it or not have,

111
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:55,810
I've listened to a lot of his books on
tape and read his books and he's got a

112
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:59,650
lot of interesting ways of looking at
things that I really think are enabling.

113
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,580
But one of the things that he said is
that sometimes if two people are going

114
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:04,810
along very same path,

115
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,270
like think of yourself as like two boats.

116
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,110
If one boat just turns
one degree to the right,

117
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,500
like over the course of the boats,

118
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,580
motion through life,

119
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:20,581
just that one decision can lead it so
far away from the original path that it

120
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:21,604
was on.

121
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,230
And that the,

122
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,360
oftentimes it's a good
time that leads you,

123
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:27,701
you know,

124
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:30,730
and it might cost you a day
or two of being hung over.

125
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,570
It might,

126
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,250
but there might be that phone call,

127
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:34,750
we would call each other on a Wednesday.

128
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:36,880
Like I had a fucking gray type dude.

129
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:37,590
That was funny.

130
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,860
I even

131
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,311
have to be,

132
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:43,311
I'm not even talking about like a crazy
fucking boozy fucking crazy because the

133
00:04:43,591 --> 00:04:46,770
reason why I asked the question is because
whenever I meet people I like and I

134
00:04:46,771 --> 00:04:47,604
respect,

135
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,270
you know,

136
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:48,421
I,

137
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,330
I'd like to ask them questions because
I believe that's how you learn.

138
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,670
And so I have this problem
because I'll tell you what,

139
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,870
I grew up poor.

140
00:04:57,871 --> 00:04:58,410
I grew up,

141
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:58,660
uh,

142
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,131
they're poor.

143
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:02,490
I left home at a very young age
and a lot of what I learned,

144
00:05:02,491 --> 00:05:04,260
I learned initially through books,

145
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:04,441
you know,

146
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:06,120
so I'd read books and then I,

147
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,560
that's why I have this sort of a intense
curiosity about the world because I'm

148
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:10,651
like,

149
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:11,101
oh fuck,

150
00:05:11,101 --> 00:05:12,570
I like to go there and
see that for myself.

151
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,823
So anyway,

152
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,310
speaking of a general,

153
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,250
so I go to the Ukraine,

154
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,671
you know,

155
00:05:17,671 --> 00:05:18,240
I'm not,

156
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:18,571
you know,

157
00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:20,940
I'm just a regular fucking
dude from butt fuck nowhere.

158
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,650
And I go there and I have this dinner and,

159
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:23,861
and,

160
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:24,121
and,

161
00:05:24,121 --> 00:05:28,950
and they bring out these potato pancakes
with sour cream and caviar and vodka

162
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,140
and all this shit.

163
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:30,910
And I'm,

164
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,650
as you know,

165
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,930
I think it was the first time I
carry and I'm eating it and I'm like,

166
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,780
this is fucking awesome and I'm
loving how we are right off the bat.

167
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,171
Yeah.

168
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,130
First time I ever had it.

169
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,870
Now granted I was a few vodkas in,

170
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:40,291
but you know,

171
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:41,170
like jigging,

172
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,770
the voc can eat in the caviar
and it's Russia and it's crazy.

173
00:05:43,771 --> 00:05:45,210
We were up in the middle of
fucking nowhere is not Russia,

174
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:46,044
the Ukraine.

175
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,560
We're out in the middle of fucking
nowhere and it's some crazy costs act,

176
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,050
shit's going down and it's,

177
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,721
I'm like,

178
00:05:51,721 --> 00:05:52,081
fuck,

179
00:05:52,081 --> 00:05:54,390
this is like living in
a book and it's crazy.

180
00:05:54,391 --> 00:05:54,930
And I,

181
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,770
I literally had one of the best nights
and when it was like living in a,

182
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,101
in a,

183
00:05:58,101 --> 00:05:58,371
in a,

184
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:02,480
in a book from the 18 hundreds so I had
one of the best times of my life then,

185
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,200
you know,

186
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,650
so for,

187
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,550
for the longest time I'm like,

188
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,091
I fucking,

189
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:07,520
caviar is my favorite fucking food and
this is the greatest thing in the world.

190
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,440
Then I was shooting in Iran,

191
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,960
so I'm going to Iran when the
best carrier comes from now.

192
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,790
And I'm in my hotel room and my
story in my hotel in the ran,

193
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:20,270
the only hotel foreigners can stay
in they cell caviar in the lobby.

194
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,280
So I'm sitting there
in the lobby and I go,

195
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:22,861
fuck yeah,

196
00:06:22,861 --> 00:06:23,150
I'm fine.

197
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,050
I love caviar.

198
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,340
That's my favorite shit now man.

199
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,670
So I go and I buy the
caviar right in the store.

200
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,560
It's like the best is,

201
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:29,961
I don't know,

202
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:32,810
I bought like $10,000 with the
caviar for 100 bucks or some shit.

203
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,720
So I get it and I go upstairs
but didn't have no booze.

204
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:35,991
Right.

205
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:36,650
Cause it's the rent.

206
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:40,850
So I have like Orange Fanta and some
chips in this caviar and I'm like this is

207
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:41,860
just fucking salty.

208
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:44,750
You fucking fishing is
what the police like.

209
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:45,200
Shit,

210
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,620
what the fuck is it only
tastes good when you're drunk.

211
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,430
I think this is the whole question that
I have is that like when you have a big

212
00:06:52,431 --> 00:06:55,370
fucking Fattal steak with
a good glass of red wine,

213
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,240
how much of it is the fucking red wine
and how much of it is the state when you

214
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:02,780
have your linguine with clams with a
nice fucking Chris fucking white wine,

215
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,590
how much of it is white wine?

216
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,301
I'm very whatever.

217
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:07,340
How much is the fucking is the,

218
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,430
is the talk and the,

219
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,650
the thing around,

220
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,370
like you said,

221
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,600
do you have a meal with your family?

222
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:13,670
How much of that is with the
family and with the thing.

223
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,060
And then so when I was
sitting up there in,

224
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,371
in,

225
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:16,611
in,

226
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:21,611
in this fucking Shitty fucking hotel
room in and been Shit Karissa was Phanta

227
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,623
I'm like,

228
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,810
actually I probably just
enjoyed the fucking evening,

229
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:27,711
you know,

230
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:32,000
I enjoyed the people and the craziness
and the fucking Bodkin of caviar and the

231
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:35,180
fact that I hadn't had it before and
everything went fucking ape shit and all

232
00:07:35,181 --> 00:07:35,690
that stuff.

233
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,920
Not h I shouldn't save Shit.

234
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:37,631
It was a,

235
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:40,010
it was a very fucking
transformative evening.

236
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,560
And then when I just had the
straight up caviar and like,

237
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:43,101
man,

238
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:43,934
I don't know.

239
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,670
Funny what a contrast.

240
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:46,971
Yeah.

241
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:49,250
And so when I was asking you the question,

242
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:51,020
cause we were talking about
food and you were saying like,

243
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:51,201
you know,

244
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:52,130
if you have a bad back,

245
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:52,921
you shouldn't need to pass that.

246
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:53,090
I'm like,

247
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:53,340
you know,

248
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:53,910
Fuck I love,

249
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:54,510
fuck

250
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:54,751
no.

251
00:07:54,751 --> 00:07:57,750
What I was saying is that this a
chiropractor that I was talking to,

252
00:07:57,751 --> 00:07:58,200
uh,

253
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,921
over the weekend,

254
00:07:58,921 --> 00:08:02,670
she was explained to me
the influence of a certain,

255
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:02,940
uh,

256
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,560
wheats and glutens and
how it inflamed tissue.

257
00:08:07,561 --> 00:08:11,610
And that you can get a substantial anti
inflammatory response by just cutting

258
00:08:11,611 --> 00:08:12,480
wheat out of your diet.

259
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,140
Yeah,

260
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,860
I agree with you that there's a pleasure
to eating that I think is like super

261
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:17,340
important.

262
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,020
It pleasure to eating
and a pleasure to drink.

263
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,360
I mean I like can I smoke weed and
not drink because I would talk to that

264
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:23,701
problem.

265
00:08:23,701 --> 00:08:24,181
No,

266
00:08:24,181 --> 00:08:25,014
we're not doing that.

267
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:25,860
For me,

268
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,060
weed is like,

269
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,220
that's the one that really
made a big difference.

270
00:08:29,221 --> 00:08:34,221
Like I think alcohol has played a good
part in a lot of positive aspects of my

271
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,410
life as far as like joyful evening,

272
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:40,950
having fun with friends and telling
them that you love them and hugging them

273
00:08:40,951 --> 00:08:41,520
and,

274
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,031
and you know,

275
00:08:42,031 --> 00:08:43,200
even whatever,

276
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,060
a romantic altercations,

277
00:08:45,061 --> 00:08:46,230
you know the boys,

278
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,850
no girls bro,

279
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,590
the Shit Brian.

280
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,050
But as far as like what,

281
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,480
what transformed me as a human being now,

282
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,920
marijuana more important.

283
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,310
Yeah.

284
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,611
Yeah.

285
00:08:56,611 --> 00:08:59,460
Merritt marijuana was to
me like there was like a,

286
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,760
almost like a missing piece to my sort
of conceptual puzzle of like how I

287
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:06,180
interfaced with the,

288
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:07,770
with nature and with the world.

289
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,311
I was like,

290
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:10,410
why am I so God Damn Aggro?

291
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,710
Right.

292
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,011
You know,

293
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:12,410
and then all sudden I find weed.

294
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:12,811
I was like,

295
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:13,644
boom.

296
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:15,540
I know.

297
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:15,781
Yeah.

298
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:16,290
I know.

299
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:16,760
For me,

300
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,000
actually booze was my savior because I
was hanging out with a lot of dudes who

301
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:21,930
are doing some serious,

302
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,950
serious drugs drug and my whole thing was,

303
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,230
I don't want to be 60 years old,

304
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,890
and so I always have this
idyllic sort of retirement,

305
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:33,870
which I'm trying to get to
sooner rather than later.

306
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:37,140
Now it's just like just sort
of forgotten like little cove,

307
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:41,190
you know the little codes
neighbor and my wife,

308
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,080
I'm solar.

309
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,050
I'm sitting there at the school.

310
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,100
I'm going to send you this.

311
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,090

and a one and a half.

314
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,280

316
00:09:52,271 --> 00:09:53,230

317
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,120

Okay.

We got a big lesbian super party.

322
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,190
I'm going to send you this article.

323
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:07,191
It's a fantastic article about a
dude who was diagnosed with lymphoma,

324
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,750
lymphoma,

325
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,331
cancer,

326
00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:10,570
like the worst cancer you can ever.

327
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,190
And,

328
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,420
and he was a Greek dude.

329
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,710
You grew up in America,

330
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:14,100
but like,

331
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:14,371
you know,

332
00:10:14,371 --> 00:10:15,570
came here when he was three assumptions.

333
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,740
So he goes back to Greece to this
little island in the middle of nowhere,

334
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,690
and he has to walk up this hill every day.

335
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:22,770
He goes to talk to his buddies,

336
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:23,490
drinking the wine,

337
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,450
he's eating the food from the,

338
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,403
from wherever,

339
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,820
and all of a sudden,

340
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,960
like five years.

341
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,830
But he was given like,

342
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,071
you know,

343
00:10:29,071 --> 00:10:30,330
six months to live or whatever,

344
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,560
not even six weeks to live.

345
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:32,600
And,

346
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,660
and they said,

347
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:33,740
well,

348
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,890
you know what the fuck happened?

349
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:35,391
You didn't die.

350
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,701
And he goes,

351
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:36,060
you know,

352
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,000
I came here and I forgot to die because,

353
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,600
you know,

354
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,100
he's sitting there and,

355
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,600
and there's no stress.

356
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,520
And he's walking up the
hill every day and he's,

357
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:47,310
he's drinking wine with his buddies
and he's eating the food from the,

358
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,641
you know,

359
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:49,740
the fish from the bay
in the fucking whenever.

360
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,480
And I sit there and I say,

361
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:51,690
you know,

362
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,580
now I'm looking at this shit.

363
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:57,390
So my idyllic retirement is basically I'm
stealing this guy who killed cancer by

364
00:10:57,391 --> 00:11:02,391
living this euphoric life of I live on
this little cove and I'm drinking my wine

365
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,700
and I'm sitting out there and I'm
just blissing out on reality now.

366
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,470
That's why I didn't get hooked to heroin.

367
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,570
That's why I didn't get
hooked to fucking crack.

368
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:11,730
That's why I didn't get hooked all
the shit to my boys got hooked too,

369
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:13,380
because I always was thought to myself,

370
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,270
if I fucking get hooked to this shit,

371
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,910
I'm going to have to a
die or be fucking quit it.

372
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:18,571
And if I quit it,

373
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:18,991
guess what?

374
00:11:18,991 --> 00:11:22,340
I'm never going to be able to sit on that
fucking cove with my glass of fucking

375
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,900
wine sitting out there and being
this blissful old Buddha do,

376
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,810
right.

377
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,850
But when I was a kid,

378
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,770
I thought I was going to die.

379
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,551
So I didn't give a fuck.

380
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:30,960
I'd do anything cause I'm going to die.

381
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:31,651
Who the fuck cares?

382
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:32,910
Why did you think you were going to die?

383
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,020
Because I was going to die.

384
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:34,680
I mean,

385
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,370
you know,

386
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,810
everybody I grew up with,

387
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:37,470
you know,

388
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,860
when I was a kid died because
we were bad guys doing bad shit.

389
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,050
People die and all that stuff.

390
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,160
How bad were you guys?

391
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,300
Like what did you guys
first thing anybody,

392
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,440
everybody who does like
blow farts on people.

393
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,030
I know Brian.

394
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,560
So it's like,

395
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,110
you know,

396
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,381
look,

397
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:54,360
you do some gang,

398
00:11:54,361 --> 00:11:54,850
he shit.

399
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,230
You do gang shit.

400
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,730
You doing Canadian gang.

401
00:11:57,731 --> 00:11:58,031
You should.

402
00:11:58,031 --> 00:11:58,151
Yeah,

403
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:58,631
exactly.

404
00:11:58,631 --> 00:11:59,464
How bad,

405
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,840
how bad you beat,

406
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,380
you know,

407
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:02,591
look,

408
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:03,250
people get it.

409
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,390
People get into junk.

410
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,380
It doesn't matter if it's,

411
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:05,891
by the way,

412
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,260
this is the surprising thing.

413
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,710
Well they get into everything,

414
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:09,370
but you know,

415
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,071
generally the,

416
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:10,311
the,

417
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:11,210
the end result is,

418
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,800
is it,

419
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,430
well now it could be met but
heroin and the thing is is even in,

420
00:12:15,431 --> 00:12:20,080
in Shitty sort of Nice Canada people
end up on junk or they're doing,

421
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,510
they start doing more
and more serious crimes.

422
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:23,520
And,

423
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,800
and this is one of the
reasons why my my cove was,

424
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,990
was my dream was because you know,

425
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:32,470
you have guys who are dying of heroin
overdoses are guys are going to prison for

426
00:12:32,471 --> 00:12:33,760
life or worse getting killed.

427
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,780
And,

428
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,441
and you know,

429
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:36,520
these are 1718,

430
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:37,390
19 year old kids.

431
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:40,210
And you're sitting there and saying
that's the biggest tragedy is you never

432
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:40,840
fucking live here.

433
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,530
Use a teenager.

434
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,550
You think you're fucking live your life.

435
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:43,271
You haven't lived shit.

436
00:12:43,271 --> 00:12:43,901
You haven't done shit.

437
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:44,734
You haven't seen shit.

438
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,100
Right.

439
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,460
And one of the reasons why I say I'm
going to go out and I'm going to see shit

440
00:12:48,461 --> 00:12:49,420
and I'm going to do all this shit,

441
00:12:49,421 --> 00:12:51,010
whatever is because I didn't fucking die.

442
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:51,760
Yeah.

443
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,560
But at a certain point
you sit there and you say,

444
00:12:53,561 --> 00:12:53,940
look,

445
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,773
you,

446
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,050
you know,

447
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,510
and I know how hard life is.

448
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,840
We know fucking what good
things are or can be.

449
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:02,260
Right.

450
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:02,521
And,

451
00:13:02,521 --> 00:13:03,191
and can be.

452
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:06,910
And also we realized there's a
lot of people who didn't make it.

453
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:07,421
You know,

454
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:09,200
there's a lot of people
who just for one hour,

455
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,400
one reason or another,

456
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,470
they don't get to where you are.

457
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,430
So what I'm trying to say is you,

458
00:13:13,431 --> 00:13:13,900
you know,

459
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,690
you want to get to more of a,

460
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:16,861
uh,

461
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:17,770
of an understanding,

462
00:13:17,771 --> 00:13:18,920
and this is why I go back to it.

463
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,650
Like I don't give a fuck
what people think about me.

464
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:21,560
I don't give a fuck about,

465
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,560
about shit because when you see it,

466
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:24,400
you sit there and say,

467
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,450
on this hand,

468
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,640
this motherfucker got shot or this right.

469
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,680
I got it right down and
this guy and got into this.

470
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,440
Now to go back to this,

471
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,590
it's quite long winded,

472
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,330
but if you go back to it,

473
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,830
what do I want to do?

474
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:39,370
I want to sit in the cove with my family,

475
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,540
your family,

476
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,703
hanging out,

477
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,693
have a drink,

478
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,960
enjoying myself.

479
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,780
I don't know how much food.

480
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,190
And although I'm a fat bastard,

481
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:50,110
I don't know how much food
is going to play into that,

482
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,680
but I definitely want to be sitting there
when that glass of wine looking out at

483
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:55,960
that cove and just go
on a fucking made it.

484
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,910
And that's why I don't get,

485
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,170
that's why I don't judge anybody,

486
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,960
because I'll tell you what everyone's
trying to get through the day to get to

487
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:03,250
their Goddamn cove.

488
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:08,550
[inaudible]

489
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:26,810
[inaudible].
