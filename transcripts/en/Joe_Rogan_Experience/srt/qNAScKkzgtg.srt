1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,053
Hmm.

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,450
Before we even started the podcast,
rest in peace.

3
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:11,820
John Anthony West,
he,

4
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:12,930
uh,
died yesterday.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,393
One of the coolest guys ever.
One of my favorite people that ever got 

6
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:17,214
on the podcast,
the first and only full gas that I've 

7
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:21,174
ever done skype.
And the only reason why I did it on 

8
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:25,800
Skype,
he's cause he wasn't feeling well and he

9
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:27,750
couldn't fly to California.
So I said,

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,613
this guy is so important.
I generally like to have conversations 

11
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:31,284
with people when they're in the room.
I think they go more friendly and 

12
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:34,434
they're smoother.
That way you can work through any bumps 

13
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:37,890
easier.
That way he feel better.

14
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:39,450
It feels like it's real.
I mean,

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,630
but he was so important to me.
I would have fucking taken,

16
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:44,190
uh,
a raven note.

17
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,990
You know what I mean?
He just,

18
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,260
if you'd never seen,
um,

19
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,580
the DVD series,
magical Egypt,

20
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,660
it's truly an amazing piece of work.

21
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:55,921
Um,
it's,

22
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:56,754
I think six dvds all about the history 
of Egypt and the immense complexity of 

23
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:05,874
the structures that are built there.
The appreciation this guy had for what 

24
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:10,800
the Egyptians did was just off the 
charts.

25
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:15,801
He was just so deeply engaged with it.
It was such a giant part of his life and

26
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,670
the passion and the curiosity that they 
had in the knowledge that he had.

27
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:27,380
And these dvds would come through and 
you would just be like holding your face

28
00:01:27,381 --> 00:01:28,214
watch.
And I'm going,

29
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,360
all my God,
these are amazing.

30
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,463
Just what a crazy time in human history,
this weird blip in the middle of North 

31
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,530
Africa where these people just went past
everybody else just way past.

32
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,010
And they did it for a long time.
Man.

33
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,220
They did it in this one spot for who 
knows how long.

34
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,230
That's where it was.
Thousands and thousands of years.

35
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,560
And Graham Hancock and John Anthony West
are the people that are really,

36
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,800
uh,
at the front of the line in terms of the

37
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:09,390
public eye of pushing the timeline back 
and there's real evidence for it.

38
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,171
Yeah,
sure.

39
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,260
I mean,
hancock's getting super vindicated or,

40
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,290
yes,
he is.

41
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,600
And you know,
um,

42
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,340
John Anthony West had vindicated as well
by um,

43
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,630
uh,
Robert Schoch,

44
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:20,580
who's a geologist from Boston 
University.

45
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,713
He went to Egypt and he studied the 
enclosure that the Sphinx was in and 

46
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,133
he's the guy that determined that you 
were looking at fishers that were 

47
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:28,980
created by thousands of years of 
rainfall,

48
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,620
which would push back because what we 
know about the,

49
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,600
the what the climate was like in that 
area.

50
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,110
Apparently it pushes it back to 
somewhere around 9,000

51
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:39,510
years ago,
which is crazy.

52
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:42,150
Yeah.
Cause look however old it was,

53
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,480
it's real.
The pyramids are a real thing.

54
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,343
Sure.
I mean everybody gets real weird about 

55
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:49,860
pushing the date back.
Like when it happened.

56
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:52,050
There's no way it happened 30,000
years ago.

57
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:54,000
It definitely happened.
2,500

58
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:56,430
BC maybe.
Maybe,

59
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,600
but it'd be,
even if it did,

60
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,400
let's just say it all was,
it just came out of nowhere.

61
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,400
Some are around that Arrow.
What a crazy spot,

62
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:04,900
man.
I mean forget about the,

63
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:05,630
the,
the,

64
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,463
the,
the confusion and the conflict around 

65
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:11,620
the timeline.
Just what it is.

66
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:12,843
Those people were on another level.
What is the main reason people get so 

67
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:21,700
pissed off at Hancock and West for 
trying to push the timeline back?

68
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,890
Because they'd been teaching one 
timeline for a long time.

69
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,320
They don't want to admit they were 
wrong.

70
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,440
If somebody publishes a book about the 
timeline and just say definitively says,

71
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:36,370
we know now that Egypt was a,
you know,

72
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,073
hunter gatherer culture that somewhere 
around 3000 BC erupted into this 

73
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:44,640
incredible civilization.
Right?

74
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,050
They just been teaching that for so 
long.

75
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:47,861
I mean,
there've been teaching,

76
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,930
uh,
not that version of it,

77
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:52,210
but there were,
their version is more accurate than what

78
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:53,530
I just said.
I'll just making up numbers.

79
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:54,364
But the point is,
what they've been teaching is probably 

80
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:57,210
not right.

81
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,280
And if they wrote books about it,
they've t taught classes about it.

82
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,260
All these people,
it's ego.

83
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:03,094
It's just the ego of scientists.
There is 100% some ego involved because 

84
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:08,134
there was a conversation that John 
Anthony West and doctor Robert Schoch 

85
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:14,230
had with an egyptologist and the 
Egyptologist.

86
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:17,680
This is on a television show that was 
actually on TV.

87
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:20,230
It was on like NBC.
It was called the mystery.

88
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:21,064
That's finks.
It was actually narrated by Charlton 

89
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,970
Heston and,
uh,

90
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:25,804
it was all about John Anthony West work 
and about Graham Hancock's work and 

91
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,290
Robert shocks work.
And,

92
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,183
um,
when they brought this geological 

93
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:38,710
evidence to these egyptologists,
they were openly mocking it,

94
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:39,723
like laughing in this weird way.
What evidence is there for this 

95
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:44,554
civilization back then?
Like how much evidence do you think 

96
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:47,764
would be there?
Like you have to realize how long ago 

97
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:53,200
he's talking about,
he's talking about maybe 10,000,

98
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:56,080
500 BC,
maybe earlier.

99
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,380
They think it might have all started 
somewhere around 30,000

100
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:01,900
years ago,
which is just fucking bananas.

101
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:02,471
Oh,
there it is.

102
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:03,304
Mystery.
This famous powerful Jamie finds it 

103
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:08,770
online are they are John Anthony West 
that he,

104
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:09,604
um,
litter literally dedicated his life to 

105
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:13,384
absorbing as much information as 
possible about the nature of the 

106
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:20,320
construction,
the time periods,

107
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,050
the hieroglyphs.
I mean,

108
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,913
it's just an amazing,
amazing body of work that that guy put 

109
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:28,421
together.
Powerful.

110
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:31,480
Charlton Heston look eager that I can 
answer.

111
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,430
I would hang out with him.
I don't care.

112
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:36,010
Even if he was wacky,
we wanted to talk about guns all day.

113
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:36,844
I'd be like,
come on Charles and hang out with 

114
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:41,200
Charlton Heston was going to turn down.
Charles,

115
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,283
do you remember when Charleston has 
another gun on TV and it was like 

116
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:50,131
they'll take my rifle away when they pry
my cold dead hands off of it.

117
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,660
Did he hold up a rifle when he said 
that?

118
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,700
I imagine.
I don't know man.

119
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:57,350
I think he probably did.
I so not.

120
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,393
Why not?

121
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,263
Why not?
Why not hold up your fucking massive 

122
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:03,710
symbol for your cock,
your Harry Potter?

123
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:04,880
He said it.
It's real.

124
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:08,210
It's just as I imagined.
He will never take my cock for me.

125
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,073
It's even better because it's a musket.
Why not just hold up a rock just like 

126
00:06:12,011 --> 00:06:16,600
got rock any rock,
huh?

127
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,653
Yeah.
People get fucking really passionate 

128
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:24,230
about that.
That guns circumcision.

129
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,573
I am.

130
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,443
Oh,
I am all for responsible people being 

131
00:06:28,901 --> 00:06:29,734
able to own guns,
but I'm also completely in agreement 

132
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:34,624
with people that say that there's too 
many people out there committing crimes 

133
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:39,430
with guns.
So how do you,

134
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,560
how do you,
how do you clean all that up?

135
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:42,490
I do not know.

136
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,930
Well,
it's worth thinking about.

137
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,110
It is worth thinking about and it's 
worth talking about.

138
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:49,800
And people get upset when you start 
talking about it because they want it to

139
00:06:49,801 --> 00:06:52,980
be just know we have a right to have any
kind of gun that we want,

140
00:06:52,981 --> 00:06:54,840
but they're,
I think they're missing.

141
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,230
Um,
one of the real big problems,

142
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,960
which were just weirdly seeing the very 
beginning of it,

143
00:07:00,961 --> 00:07:02,700
dude.
And this ties in,

144
00:07:02,701 --> 00:07:03,534
you know,
like Elon Musk just blasted the fucking 

145
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,280
car and his face.
He blessed the Tesla,

146
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,123
the space.
There's a tesla floating around the 

147
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,050
planet now.
And like the,

148
00:07:11,051 --> 00:07:13,860
the way that connects with guns is,
um,

149
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,383
this is an example of technology falling
into the hands of like a private 

150
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,820
company.
This isn't the government.

151
00:07:20,821 --> 00:07:25,590
This is like Ilan fucking bad ass.
I go to burning man musk,

152
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:31,030
a dude who goes to burning man,
shot a fucking tesla into space,

153
00:07:31,321 --> 00:07:32,154
which is now,
I guess going to rotate around the 

154
00:07:33,241 --> 00:07:34,074
planet for some certain,
I don't know how long it's going to be 

155
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:36,320
up there.
Well,

156
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,190
I think it's going to Mars.
Oh,

157
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:41,520
that fucking thing is going on.
Put it in orbit around Mars.

158
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,560
It's going past Mars.
Oh,

159
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:45,930
you fucked up he lawn.
Well guess what man,

160
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:49,620
that could have been my mom.
My mom can fill on that plane.

161
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,070
You fucking asshole.
You fucked up.

162
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:53,933
Ilan.
You could have done better dumb dumb 

163
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,890
with your rockets that can land and 
shooting a gun in his face.

164
00:07:59,210 --> 00:07:59,600
Okay,
what?

165
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,220
That is what happened.

166
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,053
It's when you take it out of the 
government's hands and put it in a 

167
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:03,134
geniuses hands,
but he's got a very unique ability to 

168
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:06,230
get things done.
Sure.

169
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,830
That boring project that he's doing 
under La flame throwers,

170
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,550
there's certain guys that are so smart 
that everybody goes cause okay,

171
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,500
sure.
Everybody has steps back and go,

172
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,720
what do I do?
Want to dig holes through the bottom.

173
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:18,554
Beth,
what else do you went to the La City 

174
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,051
Council meeting?
It's like,

175
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:23,270
look guys,
I can fix this traffic thing.

176
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:24,104
What I'm going to do is I'm going to 
drill holes underneath the ground and 

177
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,860
I'm going to put your car on a high 
speed sled and

178
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,100
you don't even drive this.
It's like,

179
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:32,930
okay guys.
So,

180
00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:33,650
uh,
you've been,

181
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:37,280
you remember the old like how it used to
be at the banks with the suction tubes.

182
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,173
Where are you taking a tube and you,
your mom puts the check in and it gets 

183
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:41,714
sucked in.
I'm going to do that with fucking buses 

184
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,520
under the city.
What do you think?

185
00:08:46,521 --> 00:08:49,670
Write the check.
They're not going to let you do it.

186
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:54,850
But the thing where it connects to guns 
is it's like we're looking at the very,

187
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,830
very,
very beginning of of private individuals

188
00:08:59,070 --> 00:08:59,903
having access to technology that 
normally it was in the hands of the 

189
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:03,384
state governments.
And this is the very crazy beginning of 

190
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:07,260
it.
I didn't know he was shooting at,

191
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:08,094
at Mars for some reason.
I thought that fucking thing was going 

192
00:09:10,011 --> 00:09:10,844
to like rotate around the earth,
which made me worry that like we're 

193
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:14,724
going to end up with like a ring of 
billionaire car cause he'll be like the 

194
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:21,410
coolest thing for billionaires to do.

195
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,673
Shoot your car up.
It's also a great way to dispose a 

196
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:28,200
body's cause.
Like there's that astronaut in there and

197
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,034
I keep thinking like,
I bet that's one of the Elon Musk's 

198
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,213
enemies.
I bet he that could be a body in there 

199
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:35,963
and no one would ever fucking magic of 
it is just some asshole who robbed Elan 

200
00:09:40,741 --> 00:09:42,240
Musk in a business deal.
Yeah,

201
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,180
just shot the guy and have one of his 
flunky stuff.

202
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:48,600
I'm into a car you never fight.
Just disappeared.

203
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:51,220
He just disappeared.
That can be fucking anybody man.

204
00:09:51,221 --> 00:09:52,054
Control to major Tom and then also 
what's really bad as about this is the 

205
00:09:56,011 --> 00:10:00,270
flat earthers are now like really having
problems because of the,

206
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,700
somebody sent me a video today,
show me that it's fake.

207
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,160
The building on twitter so many that 
this is fake.

208
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,190
It's fake.
Brown was frank bro.

209
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,630
What is that?
What's fake up like what's the thing?

210
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:10,770
The moon,
the sky.

211
00:10:10,771 --> 00:10:14,490
The God of the car.
Your mom is flat,

212
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:14,891
fake,
fake,

213
00:10:14,891 --> 00:10:15,724
fake.
Fake.

214
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,653
Your mom's flat as fuck man.
Your mom's flouted in the plant earth 

215
00:10:21,031 --> 00:10:22,620
Bro.
And the earth's flat.

216
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,600
But is it this like the,
the,

217
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,063
what's crazy about the John Anthony West
stuff and the Graham Hancock stuff is 

218
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:33,671
like in the way that flat earth and 
delusional insane way sort of forces you

219
00:10:33,961 --> 00:10:34,794
to imagine yourself existing in a 
universe that's completely different 

220
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:38,544
than what you thought.
And I think that's why it's really 

221
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:42,360
appealing.
Like it's an appealing cool,

222
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:44,910
beautiful,
hilarious mythology was just like,

223
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,620
whoa,
how cool would that be if we really were

224
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:47,454
on a flat earth?
And like if I just keep going in one 

225
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:51,540
direction and hit the ice wall,
hit the ice well,

226
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,470
but over the fucking ice,
well now we're in the land of the grays,

227
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,590
you know,
I'm no longer trapped.

228
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,450
It's like,
it's a freeing feeling because like,

229
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:00,443
even though it's not like I travel 
enough to feel stuck in fucking 

230
00:11:03,721 --> 00:11:05,520
California,
which is an insane thing,

231
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,240
there's a little piece of us that knows 
we're never going to go into space.

232
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,310
We're never going to get past.
We're never going to,

233
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,980
how do you get off the map?
You know what I mean?

234
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:14,814
Like there's something in a human that 
wants to get off the fucking map where 

235
00:11:17,251 --> 00:11:18,084
you end up in a place that hasn't been 
charted yet and that's an experience 

236
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:21,804
that's gone basically like the,
I mean I imagine swaths of the Amazon 

237
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:25,524
perhaps or like some place deep deep in 
the Arctic may be in a cave or 

238
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:29,754
something,
but it used to be people just didn't 

239
00:11:31,051 --> 00:11:34,760
fucking know you could go off the map 
and you had no idea.

240
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,633
I think that must have been the biggest 
rush to be on a ship and looking at the 

241
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:42,390
maps that you guys have and you're like,
fuck dude,

242
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,570
this is,
we don't know where we're at here man.

243
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,440
Like this is unknown uncharted terrain.
So flat earth is a really,

244
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,380
I'm not,
I don't believe the earth is flat.

245
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,770
I it's more like a triangle shape.
But the other guy,

246
00:11:55,771 --> 00:11:56,604
it's a big Dick.
It's a giant cosmic dick at that would 

247
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:00,184
be looking at the head of the Dick and 
they just don't want us to know that 

248
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:03,244
cause it's kind of embarrassing.
Fucking earth looks like a big spinning 

249
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:09,370
Dick.
It's all CGI,

250
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:11,320
bro.
Shaped like a dick.

251
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:15,760
It's just a big blue and white fucking 
Dick Green.

252
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,170
Yeah.
Why do people want that?

253
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,840
We want,
we always want things to be weird,

254
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,823
right?
We want,

255
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,873
look,
the flat earth one is my favorite one 

256
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:27,160
because it's just,
what could you imagine if their rights q

257
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,110
magic they were writing,
but I if the whole plant,

258
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:29,944
I thought the world was round and 
there's all this information that shows 

259
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:32,884
the world is round.
For thousands of years ago people were 

260
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:35,074
doing calculations are sticking sticks 
into the ground in equal distance and 

261
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:39,214
measuring them and trying to see if 
there's curvature and the this Zoe's 

262
00:12:43,081 --> 00:12:43,914
been people that suspected the earth was
round way before they could ever figure 

263
00:12:46,121 --> 00:12:46,420
it out.

264
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,580
They were trying to sell it.
Look well the moon is round,

265
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,860
the sun is round.
This is around.

266
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,290
Oh yeah,
probably this was round.

267
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,030
Yeah.
And how much she would kind of think,

268
00:12:55,031 --> 00:12:55,864
well how big is this fucking thing?
And then if you get up high enough you 

269
00:12:57,971 --> 00:13:00,820
can kind of see like wow,
if it's this really big,

270
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,830
I see like a very slight curvature.
I can,

271
00:13:03,831 --> 00:13:05,860
maybe I do.
Am I always on my mind?

272
00:13:05,861 --> 00:13:06,870
Fucking myself.
Right.

273
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,223
And you could just sat around and mind 
fucked yourself into thinking that it 

274
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:12,970
was all a scam.
Yeah.

275
00:13:12,971 --> 00:13:17,080
And that the world is actually flat and 
then gravity isn't real either.

276
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:19,060
Everybody's wrong.
Yeah.

277
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,970
Except but guy on youtube,
it's exciting.

278
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,250
It's magnets that pull people into the 
earth.

279
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,290
Your life gets so exciting at that 
point.

280
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,430
Oh yes.
Now you are.

281
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,080
You're,
you feel danger.

282
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:32,110
You're risking your fucking ass by 
getting out there.

283
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,260
Cause the Nass holes are going to take 
you out.

284
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:36,880
Dude,
the Clinton Foundation,

285
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,550
Clinton Foundation finds out about your 
theories.

286
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,230
The earth being flat.
You're fuck,

287
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:42,340
come get you.
They're going to get you.

288
00:13:42,341 --> 00:13:43,174
So now you're living,
now you get to live in maybe a not very 

289
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:45,963
happy world,
but an exciting world because you're 

290
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:51,640
seeing vans,
you're seeing fucking like create.

291
00:13:51,641 --> 00:13:52,600
Now this is,
by the way,

292
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:56,620
this is not say that there isn't some 
massive,

293
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,633
huge unknown swath of reality that's 
sitting right in front of us at all 

294
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:04,060
times.
It's actively being hidden by the United

295
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:04,893
States government in the military.
That the technology that they finally 

296
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:07,654
detected the thing and they don't want 
us to know because they know if we know 

297
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,570
who the fuck knows what the reason is,
but they don't want us to know just yet.

298
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,583
I'm not saying that's not the case.
I'm just saying with flat earth in 

299
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:17,620
particular.

300
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,180
Freaking me the fuck out man.
What do you know?

301
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,100
What do I know?
What do you know man?

302
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,260
The fucking problem is I can't talk 
about it yet.

303
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,360
Oh my,
I stopped getting the check.

304
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:26,470
They're like,
you can't like,

305
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,970
you know,
we'll tell you but you can't,

306
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,833
you can't completely reveal.
It seems like one of the videos that 

307
00:14:31,391 --> 00:14:33,370
would play before you,
uh,

308
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:39,270
first loading up halflife 10,
this is the new new half life.

309
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,820
The government is hiding a dimension.
Well,

310
00:14:42,821 --> 00:14:43,654
I may have access to just come out was 
that they picked up some kind of Ufo 

311
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:53,000
like the government did release Ufo 
video.

312
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,930
I always assume this is captain 
skeptical over here.

313
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,913
I always assume if the government is 
ever sang that there's Ufo shows or 

314
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:02,714
something really crazy like that,
it's to hide some shit they're doing in 

315
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:05,864
like Guatemala.
It's like they don't want anybody to be 

316
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:11,200
paying attention to something weird 
they're doing so they'll,

317
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,680
they'll just start talking about u of o 
is everybody's art for real,

318
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,920
like a real special,
you've got a video man.

319
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:20,430
I mean it's a really huge question mark,
which is,

320
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,860
and there are people out there who like 
think,

321
00:15:22,861 --> 00:15:23,694
who say they have answers to why they're
just this idea is there is a gradual 

322
00:15:27,241 --> 00:15:31,560
dissemination of information that's 
happening because they're,

323
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:35,220
they're priming the pump and then it 
splits into two versions.

324
00:15:35,221 --> 00:15:38,280
One of the versions of the stories is,
fuck,

325
00:15:38,281 --> 00:15:42,960
if you want to dominate a planet,
get them kind of like subconsciously,

326
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,830
subliminally primed for the idea that 
you know,

327
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,220
I think there's some really advanced 
technology out there and there's,

328
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,090
there's aliens riding around in it and 
we've,

329
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,130
and we make contact,
we've made contact with a,

330
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,293
they call themselves the Galactic 
Council of Celestial elders and they've 

331
00:16:01,801 --> 00:16:06,801
been making contact with us for the last
50 years and they've been instructing us

332
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:09,930
and how to not only reveal themselves to
you,

333
00:16:09,931 --> 00:16:10,764
but to,
to let the technology come out in a way 

334
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:15,810
that's not going to be completely 
catastrophic for our society.

335
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,080
There are peace loving,
wonderful beings,

336
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:23,880
but we've decided to follow their 
instructions to the t and so now they're

337
00:16:23,881 --> 00:16:24,714
ready to introduce themselves and then 
suddenly an alien is on TV and suddenly 

338
00:16:29,941 --> 00:16:30,774
the government is using a completely 
made up thing to try to dominate the 

339
00:16:35,491 --> 00:16:36,780
planet by saying,
no,

340
00:16:36,781 --> 00:16:37,614
it's aliens.
We found them when in fact it's project 

341
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,640
blue beam.
Right.

342
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:42,474
That's,
that's one of the ideas that are their 

343
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:45,540
ideas.
All that Shit's true.

344
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:46,643
They,
there's a thing that happens when a 

345
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:49,074
planet reaches a certain level of 
technological sophistication that it 

346
00:16:52,201 --> 00:16:53,034
gets contacted by some kind of order 
council federation of Cindy and 

347
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:00,803
technological civilizations and they 
sort of begin to like walk the planet 

348
00:17:06,841 --> 00:17:11,841
through phases of getting that shit out 
into the world in a way that isn't going

349
00:17:12,621 --> 00:17:15,060
to fuck up their planet and they know 
how to do it.

350
00:17:15,061 --> 00:17:18,720
They have a system in place,
they don't come from the stars.

351
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,990
They're not something detectable by 
telescopes there.

352
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:22,843
Like in the DMT realm,
are there like existing in some 

353
00:17:24,781 --> 00:17:28,650
alternate dimension and technology is 
just one of the things that they,

354
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,140
uh,
use to communicate with us.

355
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:31,780
I've

356
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,540
been toying around with this idea for a 
long time.

357
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,403
Most of the time when I'm really high,
that ideas are a life form that they're 

358
00:17:40,211 --> 00:17:43,000
not,
it's not as simple as your creativity,

359
00:17:43,001 --> 00:17:46,090
putting together some pieces that 
weren't there before.

360
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,010
I think it's that,
but I think it's you're

361
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,640
tuning into something,
you're tuning into some weird,

362
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,510
like some of the ideas almost seem to 
write themselves and it could be because

363
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:00,390
the subconscious process of your mind,
but it also could because the,

364
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,613
because that these what ideas are and 
what just the concept of thinking is 

365
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:09,120
it's essentially the seeds of creation,
right?

366
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,133
Everything that's ever existed on earth,
the humans have invented and built came 

367
00:18:15,781 --> 00:18:18,300
from a mind.
It came from thinking,

368
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,050
how do I put together this house?
Yeah,

369
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,030
how do I put together this skyscraper?
How do I make a plane?

370
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,280
How do I make a TV?
How do I make of this?

371
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,800
How do I make of that?
Like we're vessels for ideas.

372
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,813
We're like sitting there with all these 
neurons firing and electricity going 

373
00:18:32,731 --> 00:18:33,564
left and right,
and all these areas of our brains 

374
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:37,890
lighting up.
It's catching ideas.

375
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,300
When I'm super gone,
especially on edibles,

376
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,360
sometimes I feel like I'm in a river of 
ideas and I'm naked and I can't hold the

377
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:50,070
fish that just flying by me.
I'm like,

378
00:18:50,071 --> 00:18:52,680
Jesus,
just trying to get these ideas right.

379
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,290
It almost feels like these are not at my
ideas.

380
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,273
These are ideas that I'm working on.
I've put in the effort to go out and 

381
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,660
fish for these ideas.

382
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,930
Well it's kind of like imagine if there 
was a technology that could,

383
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,100
like we send out these signals into 
space,

384
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:10,720
um,
satellites with er,

385
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,740
with,
with fucking records in them,

386
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:17,510
but perhaps other civilizations are 
blasting the planet with ideas,

387
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,180
Eh,
that are designed to be picked up by the

388
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,400
scope of the human mind.
Yeah.

389
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,353
And so what you're doing is you're 
actually like popping into an alien 

390
00:19:25,491 --> 00:19:26,324
frequency which is filled with all these
various ideas that are part of the 

391
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,033
cultivation of a planet to like try to 
get it to the point of like being able 

392
00:19:34,251 --> 00:19:36,890
to make contact and they're,
they're just seeding,

393
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,380
seeding us with,
with fuck.

394
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:40,363
When you read like John Lilly and read 
about Tesla and read about a lot of the 

395
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,184
great inventions that have happened,
the people who had the epiphanous 

396
00:19:49,251 --> 00:19:50,084
moment,
it wasn't like there was scrunching 

397
00:19:51,561 --> 00:19:52,394
their fucking forehead.
It was like the idea came to them and a 

398
00:19:54,501 --> 00:19:57,050
vision.
How many times do you hear over and over

399
00:19:57,051 --> 00:19:58,520
again?
It came to me in a vision,

400
00:19:58,521 --> 00:19:59,354
a dream.

401
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:02,070
Do you know that the very notion of 
science itself,

402
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,953
uh,
came to supposedly like the birth of 

403
00:20:04,651 --> 00:20:08,570
science came from a dream that day cards
had really,

404
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,460
yeah.
He had a dream that,

405
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,520
I forget exactly the term that he,
the way they use it,

406
00:20:14,521 --> 00:20:15,930
I'm sure it was deciphered too,
right?

407
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:19,860
Like what did he originally speak?
What language to car descartes speak?

408
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,620
Fuck,
I don't know man.

409
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:23,630
Like I think it was like classic Nerd,

410
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,140
but he was,
um,

411
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,520
he was out like at war,
who's like campaigning.

412
00:20:33,521 --> 00:20:35,050
He is French,
he's French.

413
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,243
He was a,
I believe it was like he was on a 

414
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:41,710
military campaign in the army or 
something along those lines.

415
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:42,963
And uh,
he signed up for adventure to go off 

416
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:46,444
into the military.
And during that time period he had a 

417
00:20:48,671 --> 00:20:53,671
dream that something about to be able to
harness nature,

418
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,270
it would be done in weights and 
measurements.

419
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,080
I forget exactly the term,
see if he could find the term.

420
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,630
The,
that was essentially what people say.

421
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:05,464
This is really when you,
when you talk about the very birth of 

422
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,413
the early,
so you could trace back the idea of 

423
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:14,120
modern science,
like the ethics and the ideas,

424
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,240
the concepts of Mondo Science.

425
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,310
Well don't you from a dream don't date 
it goes,

426
00:21:17,311 --> 00:21:18,144
I mean before the cart we're dealing 
with like it gets really interesting 

427
00:21:20,761 --> 00:21:22,270
because you're dealing with that 
outcome.

428
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:24,870
It's like John d who were,
who were,

429
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,600
I mean Jon Dee was someone who is,
who's John d?

430
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,700
John D is,
is it like,

431
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,580
you know Jason Lu,
you know that is,

432
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:32,670
no,
he's an author.

433
00:21:32,671 --> 00:21:35,230
He just wrote this fucking bad ass book 
on John D.

434
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:40,240
Is this one of those people kind kinda 
like Crawley who had this huge impact on

435
00:21:40,501 --> 00:21:43,590
society but we don't really know a lot.
We would,

436
00:21:43,591 --> 00:21:45,630
most people don't know the fuck he was.
Right.

437
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,770
But you've heard of like,
uh,

438
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,780
the Enoki and tablets are like the 
Gnocchi and angels basically.

439
00:21:51,781 --> 00:21:52,614
John Dee was like an outcome as to is 
working with Queen Elizabeth to try to 

440
00:21:57,031 --> 00:21:59,250
turn lead into gold,
which was a,

441
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:02,070
you know,
a big fucking pursuit back then,

442
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:02,791
which is like,
shit,

443
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:06,120
if we could turn,
if we can transmute metals into gold,

444
00:22:06,121 --> 00:22:07,990
it's like,
I mean they all tried to yeah,

445
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:08,651
do that,
right?

446
00:22:08,651 --> 00:22:11,560
Was that when they first started 
recognizing elements?

447
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,750
Like when did they first start 
recognizing elements?

448
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,970
Um,
I,

449
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,870
I don't,
I don't know probably that it's,

450
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:19,650
it must be through alchemy cause they 
were like trying to break things down to

451
00:22:19,651 --> 00:22:20,484
their fundamental,
they're trying to break things down to 

452
00:22:22,111 --> 00:22:25,650
like their fundamental components.
How many movies are about that?

453
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,300
Someone trying to make gold?
Well,

454
00:22:27,301 --> 00:22:28,134
I mean it's the,
it's one of the great pursuits and it's 

455
00:22:30,931 --> 00:22:32,400
actually,
that's that there's a,

456
00:22:32,401 --> 00:22:36,300
it's what we're still doing only we're 
not trying to turn a lead into gold.

457
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,970
We're trying to turn a lead into a 
thinking machine.

458
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:42,510
That's what we're doing that because 
better than turning matter and to goal,

459
00:22:42,511 --> 00:22:43,344
if you can turn matter and do a fucking 
thing that is thinking and cindy hunt 

460
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,273
the nic and figure out how to turn lead 
into gold by its advanced ability to 

461
00:22:50,671 --> 00:22:51,870
process data.

462
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:56,370
And if you were an alien race,
you'd be concerned about nuclear weapons

463
00:22:56,371 --> 00:22:57,204
for sure,
but you would really be concerned about 

464
00:22:58,441 --> 00:22:59,910
artificial life.
Sure.

465
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,773
What do you,
what do you assholes about to hit the 

466
00:23:01,831 --> 00:23:02,740
switch on?
Yeah.

467
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,880
Have you thought this?
This through would like those minions in

468
00:23:05,881 --> 00:23:06,714
despicable me.
We're just wrecking shit and eaten 

469
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:08,983
nails,
right?

470
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,033
Yeah.
We just try and things stick in 

471
00:23:12,671 --> 00:23:14,830
electrical sockets in our heads.
Fuck yeah.

472
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,693
Dude.
Can you imagine if beings in the DMT 

473
00:23:17,051 --> 00:23:20,350
Rome decided to start setting off 
nuclear explosions?

474
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,240
I mean,
maybe that's what an earthquake is.

475
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,313
Maybe when we have an earthquake,
it's like a nuclear test and another 

476
00:23:26,141 --> 00:23:28,600
dimension shaking our planet.
Yeah,

477
00:23:28,601 --> 00:23:29,590
I said it.
No,

478
00:23:29,591 --> 00:23:30,424
I don't fucking believe it.
I can already hear the light people 

479
00:23:34,241 --> 00:23:36,220
being like,
what the fuck are you talking about,

480
00:23:36,221 --> 00:23:36,730
man?

481
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:37,563
June 8th,
1637 day card cut codifies scientific 

482
00:23:42,731 --> 00:23:44,470
method.
Wow.

483
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,430
Interesting.

484
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,873
He outlines his rules for understanding 
the natural world through reason and 

485
00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:52,040
skepticism,
forming the foundation of the scientific

486
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:52,874
method still in use today.
There a a term that he had that he came 

487
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,144
up with like in a dream,
see if he could find that because there 

488
00:24:01,971 --> 00:24:06,230
was like a phrase that he said obviously
translated from French.

489
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,333
I,
I,

490
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:11,000
I the reason I s the dit cart fucking 
bugs before him,

491
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:11,691
that one.
No,

492
00:24:11,691 --> 00:24:13,230
it's not.
I think therefore I am.

493
00:24:13,231 --> 00:24:14,064
Okay.
But that was obviously an interesting 

494
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:17,600
one.
He liked to do shit like,

495
00:24:17,601 --> 00:24:19,250
and I could be wrong about this,
but I,

496
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:22,820
I clearly remember reading about this.
He was like,

497
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,713
what do you call it mechanistically or 
like he believed the animals were just 

498
00:24:26,601 --> 00:24:28,490
machines basically.
And so,

499
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:29,683
so like he would like,
and I love Jamie if you could look this 

500
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,070
up.
So I don't get a suede with people being

501
00:24:34,071 --> 00:24:35,420
like,
that's a different person.

502
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:36,523
But apparently he would do shit like 
hold that dog's beating heart and it's 

503
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,290
in his hand while it died.
Oh my God.

504
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,363
And he said things like,
people who are afraid to kick dogs 

505
00:24:45,231 --> 00:24:48,950
aren't really my students because they 
know it will look that up,

506
00:24:48,951 --> 00:24:49,701
Jamie.
We share this,

507
00:24:49,701 --> 00:24:53,180
not like propaganda.
If there was like an info wars.com

508
00:24:53,181 --> 00:24:56,780
back then like what's going on here?
This is why I'm covering it with like,

509
00:24:56,781 --> 00:24:58,640
I'm not saying he's out there kicking 
dogs.

510
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,503
I think he was kicking dogs.
I think the cart like I just found it 

511
00:25:01,491 --> 00:25:02,324
was pretty rough.

512
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,150
Maybe they all kick dogs back then.
In a nutshell,

513
00:25:05,151 --> 00:25:09,440
frank fro philosopher Rene decartes 
didn't believe animals had souls to test

514
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:10,274
his theory.

515
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,240
Nailed his wife's dog to a board and 
chopped it open while the poor thing was

516
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:16,340
still a long guy.
Fun Guy.

517
00:25:16,341 --> 00:25:19,210
Crater is science was a nail and dogs to
fucking boards.

518
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,120
Where'd you read this?
How do we know it's on fucking hard.com?

519
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,003
No,
it's nuts.

520
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,200
It's nuts.
I hope that you really are knowledge,

521
00:25:27,201 --> 00:25:29,090
nuts,
nuts for knowledge.

522
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,583
I love nuts.
That guy definitely looks like he 

523
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:36,560
fucking Nail Dogs to boards.
Look at that fucking face.

524
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,640
Mm,
mm.

525
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,070
Look at it.
Look at it.

526
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:39,923
Squirm.
The greatest minds are capable of the 

527
00:25:42,191 --> 00:25:44,650
greatest vices as well as the greatest 
virtues.

528
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,330
That's what he said after cut open a 
cat,

529
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,270
dude,
that's like,

530
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,770
it's the father of science is also like,
that's Jeffrey Dahmer Level Shit too.

531
00:25:52,771 --> 00:25:53,630
Like he was not,

532
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,410
I think people did a lot of that back 
then.

533
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,530
Nayland dogs divorce.
I just think the,

534
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:03,130
I think the value of life was severely 
diminished.

535
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,730
I think back then the 16 hundreds people
were dying left and right of everything.

536
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:11,080
You got a cold dead break your leg dead,
get gored by a bull,

537
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,760
dead,
everything dead.

538
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,920
Oh,
you got an infection dead.

539
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,660
Well you got the flu,
probably dead.

540
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:16,980
But

541
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,260
that's definitely in Europe.
Like in India.

542
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:22,950
I'm not saying in India it was like a 
utopia and everyone is sweet to animals,

543
00:26:22,951 --> 00:26:25,920
but in Buddhism it was still,
it was like there was,

544
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,800
it was a lot more compassionate.
Like that's true.

545
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,780
Why do you think that happened?
APP

546
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,633
and why does like like Thailand and 
places that are Buddhist places 

547
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,583
generally?
I mean obviously there's violence 

548
00:26:36,001 --> 00:26:39,480
everywhere,
but generally more of a peaceful vibe.

549
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,513
Right?
Like Buddhist nations and Buddhist 

550
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,910
crying a little bit.
Obviously flaws with everything.

551
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:45,763
Yes.
Anything involving people you're going 

552
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:47,784
to have outliers but over and all.
Like one of the things that my friend 

553
00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:52,590
was telling me about Thailand,
he was like,

554
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:53,940
dude,
there's no crime over there.

555
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,130
He's like,
you just go over there.

556
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:58,140
He's like everybody.
It's like real easy,

557
00:26:58,141 --> 00:27:01,350
real easy to get along with everybody.
It's like it's super safe.

558
00:27:01,351 --> 00:27:03,750
Nobody gets robbed was it's really rare.

559
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,190
Yeah,
I don't,

560
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,060
I mean,
I don't know.

561
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,073
I don't understand why that way of 
thinking emerged in the east and that 

562
00:27:13,961 --> 00:27:16,570
connection with the south emerged in the
east first,

563
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,523
what happened in the west,
which was basically decimation of a 

564
00:27:21,011 --> 00:27:24,070
previous religion,
right?

565
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,680
Paganism,
whatever you want to call it.

566
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,630
Earth based religion,
connection with life and nature,

567
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:29,643
but what's really interesting.
Yeah,

568
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,493
tell me about that.
Is it the DNA of paganism is still in 

569
00:27:32,301 --> 00:27:34,430
the system?
It's almost like we absorbed it.

570
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,900
Yeah.
Like I say,

571
00:27:35,901 --> 00:27:37,610
we,
I mean Christians,

572
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,580
you know,
Christian nation.

573
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:39,261
Well,
look,

574
00:27:39,261 --> 00:27:40,610
it's work Christian nation.
This is,

575
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,473
I'm sorry.
I'm sure we've talked about this in the 

576
00:27:42,201 --> 00:27:44,210
podcast,
but it's something I marvel over all the

577
00:27:44,211 --> 00:27:45,650
time.
I think about it a lot,

578
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,543
which is the Catholic mass.
It's when you look at the Catholic mass 

579
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,840
and you look at the New Testament,
the last supper,

580
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:57,830
and you look at,
you realize like in the fucking synoptic

581
00:27:57,831 --> 00:28:02,831
gospels and then any of the gospels,
there is nowhere that Jesus is saying.

582
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,243
What you do is take a piece of bread and
utter these prayers over it to create 

583
00:28:09,891 --> 00:28:12,620
it,
to create my flash that didn't you eat,

584
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:16,820
it's not there.
The ritual isn't there and but,

585
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,620
but the interpretation of that has 
turned into what is called high magic.

586
00:28:21,621 --> 00:28:22,454
It's called like,
it's a ceremonial magic where you are 

587
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:26,623
transforming bread into the flesh of a 
sacrificed God and people do that every 

588
00:28:34,071 --> 00:28:37,910
fucking Sunday and are like this totally
normal magic.

589
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,220
What are you talking about?
I'm not in a fucking magic.

590
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:41,323
What I do is I eat the flesh of a god 
that was sacrificed by Father God so 

591
00:28:50,661 --> 00:28:54,320
that my sins could be purified.
That's not magic.

592
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:57,680
When did that originate the sacrament?
Well,

593
00:28:57,681 --> 00:28:59,720
I've read that it has something to do 
with,

594
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,080
it goes back to Egypt,
that it,

595
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:01,963
that it's some kind of high magic 
Egyptian ritual mushroom or as a 

596
00:29:05,781 --> 00:29:06,470
mushroom

597
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,303
probably had a big bag of mushrooms and 
everybody came up and they put it on 

598
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,780
your tongue and they said,
good luck.

599
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:12,960
Yeah,
I know.

600
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,670
Yeah.
This is the place he on the other side.

601
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:15,570
I mean they said,
yeah,

602
00:29:15,571 --> 00:29:16,404
they said,
um,

603
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,660
you know,
this is the flesh of God.

604
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,523
Eat this to,
and you'll remember who you truly are 

605
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:22,883
and they gave you this,
the psychedelic and you took it and you 

606
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,183
merged back into the divine and realize 
your true identity so that for the rest 

607
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:30,714
of the week you were able to hang out 
with people and not be a complete ass 

608
00:29:33,141 --> 00:29:33,781
hole.
Cause you know,

609
00:29:33,781 --> 00:29:34,614
you share the same soul and that you're 
basically made of love as opposed to 

610
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,200
thinking that you and I are separate and
that

611
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,010
were mostly sinful,
evil things.

612
00:29:45,011 --> 00:29:49,750
Who's flashes impure?
I mean that's another fucking sweet gift

613
00:29:49,751 --> 00:29:50,584
that came from um,
fundamentalist Christianity is the 

614
00:29:53,651 --> 00:29:58,651
concept that our bodies are evil.
We can't be naked around each other.

615
00:29:58,841 --> 00:29:59,674
Even now.
Like you can't take your clothes off 

616
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,890
around people without seeming completely
insane.

617
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,753
You will get a wreck if you go outside 
and your fundamental body that you are 

618
00:30:11,681 --> 00:30:15,670
born into the universe with,
you will get arrested.

619
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,253
Like you can't walk around as you are,
you have to cover it in clothes or if 

620
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,770
you're considered to be a fucking 
pervert,

621
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:24,880
pervert,
nudist,

622
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,380
psycho.
So yeah,

623
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:27,214
the,
the fundamental vehicle that we are so 

624
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:32,290
rides around and it's considered profane
to,

625
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:33,670
to,
to do dude.

626
00:30:33,671 --> 00:30:34,504
And it like,
you see a fucking deck when you're like 

627
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:38,880
walking down the street.
Some dudes you're like,

628
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:43,710
well you can see a dick accidentally at 
the bathroom and it doesn't bother,

629
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,350
doesn't bother you.

630
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,183
Cause in the bathroom it's okay for a 
moment to profane the world with your 

631
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:52,030
fucking Dick.
So it's like that's the,

632
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,250
when you start really looking at all 
the,

633
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,610
the,
the traces of not just pagan culture,

634
00:30:57,611 --> 00:31:02,611
but just insanity from a fundamentalist 
perspective of the universe that has its

635
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:03,874
roots in what appears to be a 
misunderstanding of a really beautiful 

636
00:31:07,001 --> 00:31:10,180
story.
Then it's like mind boggling.

637
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,890
No,
not just a misunderstanding,

638
00:31:11,891 --> 00:31:12,724
but probably a conscious 
misrepresentation of the original store 

639
00:31:15,971 --> 00:31:16,804
that's molded the suit.
Whoever's needs is in charge at the 

640
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:20,050
moment.
That's right.

641
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,430
Yeah.
And people do,

642
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:22,390
I'll tell you,
man,

643
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:25,900
Catholics,
they feel guilty like they should.

644
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:27,010
I'm Catholic.
You're filling.

645
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,960
You still probably feel a little bit,
probably a little bit,

646
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:29,741
dude.
I was thinking,

647
00:31:29,741 --> 00:31:31,480
I'm not Catholic really,
but I was,

648
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:35,220
when I was in first grade,
I have this allister Croley poster.

649
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:38,830
I was going to bring the uterus seven Oh
wow.

650
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,500
1079 yeah.
Yeah.

651
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:44,380
It was the year.
The year 1000 that's it sounds like it's

652
00:31:44,381 --> 00:31:45,720
a weird sounding name.
Oh,

653
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,623
a year.
Other 1079 it feels like I'm saying 

654
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:49,600
something wrong.
Yeah,

655
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:50,621
yeah.
Wow.

656
00:31:50,621 --> 00:31:51,580
That's amazing,
man.

657
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:56,110
Yeah,
1079 so this is way after Jesus almost a

658
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:56,650
thousand years.
Yeah.

659
00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:00,700
They started doing the magical ritual 
and and so it's like to say that this is

660
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:04,960
connected to Christianity is really,
it's like actually no,

661
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:09,130
it's Christianity's a song and this is a
dance people decided to do to it,

662
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,780
but to say,
you know what I mean?

663
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:16,290
To say that it's like that it has 
anything to do with Jesus is,

664
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,373
is not true unless you're going to say 
that Jesus transmitted the data after 

665
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:23,370
his death and do some kind of mistake or
see,

666
00:32:23,371 --> 00:32:24,204
or who had the vision of this.
Now I'm not knocking the fucking 

667
00:32:27,401 --> 00:32:29,620
Catholic mass.
I think it's beautiful,

668
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,500
but let's just admit what it is.
Magic.

669
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:33,334
It's ritual magic.
You're doing ritual magic and you're 

670
00:32:36,011 --> 00:32:38,950
doing something that's been going on for
a very long,

671
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:41,270
probably before 1079

672
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,280
that dude wasn't just like sitting 
around.

673
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:43,641
I'm like,
Hey,

674
00:32:43,641 --> 00:32:46,640
I got an idea.
Let's start saying prayer over the bread

675
00:32:46,641 --> 00:32:48,380
and the bread is going to turn into 
flesh.

676
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,480
It was more like,
hey,

677
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:51,314
you know,
we've been meeting doing these rituals 

678
00:32:53,211 --> 00:32:54,044
secretly.
Why don't we just incorporate the story 

679
00:32:56,541 --> 00:33:01,541
of Christianity into this ritual that 
we've been doing for a very long time.

680
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:04,100
Do you sort of,
um,

681
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,473
pure,
purify ourselves by connecting to the 

682
00:33:07,221 --> 00:33:08,054
universe and acknowledging the fact that
existence itself is predicated on 

683
00:33:12,321 --> 00:33:15,230
devouring the flash of some other being 
not,

684
00:33:15,231 --> 00:33:16,064
you know,
like we're always in the process of 

685
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,373
inhaling the universe,
exhaling the universe eating each other 

686
00:33:22,411 --> 00:33:23,244
in the universe is eating itself.
And so the mass is this ritualized 

687
00:33:26,331 --> 00:33:28,160
version of like,
behold,

688
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:31,010
we're eating the flesh of God in 
everything we do.

689
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:32,530
And there's something really beautiful 
about that.

690
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,753
I mean,
there's no getting around life eats 

691
00:33:35,861 --> 00:33:38,660
life.
Even the various factions of,

692
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:41,440
of uh,
people on the left and the right and,

693
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:42,743
uh,
people that are animal rights activists 

694
00:33:45,701 --> 00:33:46,534
versus people that are butchers.
You're all eating something that's 

695
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,040
alive.
I mean,

696
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:54,520
you can make the distinction that the 
plants aren't suffering like the animals

697
00:33:54,521 --> 00:33:55,890
do.
And that's why it's okay.

698
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,220
Sure.
I agree with you.

699
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,293
For the most part,
it's probably a less extreme form of 

700
00:34:00,101 --> 00:34:00,934
suffering,
but it also might just be a completely 

701
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:03,334
misunderstood life form like there.
Well they're finding out so much about 

702
00:34:07,151 --> 00:34:09,940
plant communication and I've read so 
many things about that.

703
00:34:09,941 --> 00:34:10,774
I hesitate to talk about it cause I 
really want to have all my t's sliced 

704
00:34:14,141 --> 00:34:17,950
and i's dotted because it's such a 
complex issue,

705
00:34:17,951 --> 00:34:21,790
but it appears that they communicate.
It appears that there's almost like a,

706
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:26,810
that they're using the soil and the 
fungus in the soil and the mycelium,

707
00:34:27,311 --> 00:34:28,144
they all have this weird ecosystem.
It's not just like one plant by itself 

708
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,040
in the dirt.
You know,

709
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:36,250
there's a network that they're connected
to.

710
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,700
Did Jamie,
there's this thing,

711
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:39,534
I've just,
this guy gave me this thing called a 

712
00:34:40,171 --> 00:34:42,510
middy sprout,
which is,

713
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:43,883
it picks up,
I guess the bioelectricity of plants or 

714
00:34:45,991 --> 00:34:47,890
anything for that matter.
But plants I've,

715
00:34:47,891 --> 00:34:48,724
I've got it.
You stick it on your plant and it goes 

716
00:34:50,551 --> 00:34:51,384
into like your,
whatever your music system is and it 

717
00:34:53,431 --> 00:34:56,130
translates it into Midi so you can turn,
turn,

718
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,200
turn the electricity of your plant and a
music.

719
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,500
Yeah,
it's fucking cool.

720
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:03,323
Yeah.

721
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,423
Yeah.
That sound is the sound's coming from a 

722
00:35:09,681 --> 00:35:10,514
tree.

723
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:11,843
Well,
it's the electricity of the tree being 

724
00:35:12,751 --> 00:35:13,584
translated in a middy,
which is then being translated into 

725
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,520
sound.
So it's,

726
00:35:16,521 --> 00:35:19,620
it's a way to convert that data into 
music.

727
00:35:19,621 --> 00:35:22,320
It's like you're converting the bio 
electricity into,

728
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:24,060
it's not like that's the sound of a 
plant.

729
00:35:24,061 --> 00:35:24,894
It's not making celestial noises.
That's just sending energy and creating 

730
00:35:28,381 --> 00:35:29,214
mini,
which is then being translated into the 

731
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,044
sound.
So it's a way to observe the data 

732
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:35,460
instead of looking at it,
I guess on an Oscilloscope or whatever,

733
00:35:35,461 --> 00:35:37,030
you would look at that with.
Yeah,

734
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,010
it's turning into,
into

735
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,843
uh,
and the audio so you can hear the 

736
00:35:39,601 --> 00:35:40,434
pulsating kind of like rhythmic flow so 
that it's measuring electrical currents 

737
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:46,770
in the plant.
That's,

738
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,670
so there's that much of a variation that
it's like going up and down all the time

739
00:35:50,671 --> 00:35:51,570
like that.
Yeah.

740
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,940
Yeah.
It,

741
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,993
I mean,
I don't know that the total math behind 

742
00:35:55,581 --> 00:35:57,090
it,
but I've got one on my,

743
00:35:57,091 --> 00:36:00,390
I'm on a plan in my studio.
Here's my take on it.

744
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,150
The most potent psychedelic experience 
is dmt.

745
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:07,740
DMT exists in so many different plants.
It's in thousands of plants.

746
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,480
They have,
they have no idea why,

747
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:12,080
but it's in them.
And if it wasn't for Mano,

748
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:15,090
Amy's Mano,
Amy's Oxidase,

749
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,040
monoamine oxidase Mao,
which is what Mao inhibitors are.

750
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,410
If it wasn't for that,
that we have this in our body,

751
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:25,590
we would be tripping on salad.
He'd be tripping on grass.

752
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,683
You eat certain grasses,
you'd be blasted off to the center of 

753
00:36:28,381 --> 00:36:29,214
the universe.

754
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,630
You know,
for some sheep,

755
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,790
DMT is poisoned.
Like they get ahold of,

756
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:36,180
of plants that have DNP even they fall 
over,

757
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:38,580
has the legs and the legs start bucking 
up in the air.

758
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,533
That's like a canary in the coal mine.
He takes sheep out into nature and when 

759
00:36:42,181 --> 00:36:43,710
they start dying,
that's what you eat.

760
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:46,830
I think it's [inaudible] grass in 
particular.

761
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:47,783
I think there's a type of grass.
Jamie's if you could find that grass 

762
00:36:50,781 --> 00:36:52,980
that kill sheep,
but it's a grass.

763
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,120
A particularly rich.
Yeah.

764
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:54,901
Florist.
Damn.

765
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:56,300
How good's the memory on the kid even 
though he's,

766
00:36:56,301 --> 00:36:59,730
Hi Phillip Morris back.
Yeah.

767
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:00,803
That a flare induced Valera staggers and
chief portions of the lower brain as 

768
00:37:05,281 --> 00:37:09,030
seen to be damaged and oddly enough,
tinted blue.

769
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,163
They're responsible agents or the 
alkaloids contained in the various 

770
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,220
failing species.
There are whispered rumors that can you,

771
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,323
there are whispered fucking,
that's a dmt website to that whispered 

772
00:37:21,421 --> 00:37:21,750
rumors.

773
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:26,280
He's got a science not looking for wispy
are whispers,

774
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,620
whispered rumors,
fucking hippies.

775
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:33,830
The divine moment of truth is that the 
one that I'm in is one of those spangled

776
00:37:33,831 --> 00:37:36,990
made one where they use the a rant of me
with Jim Brewer.

777
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,660
That's cool.
I was harp acute.

778
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:42,750
I barely remember what I said,
but as me and brewer,

779
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:47,010
uh,
we're high on pot lollipops or Jesus and

780
00:37:47,011 --> 00:37:47,844
they took that and took part of it and 
made it this really dope music end with 

781
00:37:52,531 --> 00:37:54,870
a video to it.
I don't know if that's their video,

782
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:56,700
if they made that video.
It does.

783
00:37:56,701 --> 00:38:01,020
It looks oddly similar.
Like a tone down,

784
00:38:01,021 --> 00:38:05,160
like a pencil drawing of what you see 
when you do dmt and then,

785
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,770
yeah.
That's a sound.

786
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,740
That's beautiful.
Yeah.

787
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,940
I the good old day time.
Joe.

788
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:15,390
Weren't those the good old days.
Now we don't do it anymore though.

789
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:16,410
Cause it's elite.
Yeah.

790
00:38:16,411 --> 00:38:17,640
Why would we,
well,

791
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:18,750
it's illegal.
There's no need.

792
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,673
And also once you've been there,
it's not like you have to keep going 

793
00:38:20,971 --> 00:38:25,170
back just enough now Santa,
I need these fucking,

794
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,820
hey,
I need to do right now.

795
00:38:26,821 --> 00:38:28,520
Get a better accountant.
You know what I'm saying?

796
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,320
That's right.
And I,

797
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,750
there's some fucking great accountants 
in the DMT realm.

798
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:34,643
That's when I'll start doing right.
They're accountants of your 

799
00:38:36,221 --> 00:38:37,520
consciousness and they look at,
you can go on.

800
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:38,963
No,
no.

801
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,850
It's the best.
Yeah.

802
00:38:42,851 --> 00:38:46,550
That's pretty not too,
did you get a finger wagging at you?

803
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

804
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,043
No.
And it was like when I had a wacky 

805
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:53,950
thought,
I had a bad thought,

806
00:38:53,951 --> 00:38:56,800
a thought when a rag that was on the 
wrong page.

807
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:58,710
I was like,
this isn't an that's cool.

808
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,310
Yeah.
I love that.

809
00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:03,700
I love the in different psychedelic 
states.

810
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:04,803
I love how you witnessed how your 
consciousness is forming your reality 

811
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:11,090
and the most extreme way.
Yeah.

812
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,023
Not as though like you're producing 
matter with your thoughts or anything 

813
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:15,184
like that,
but you can watch this undulation or 

814
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:22,180
this flow going from when you're getting
negative and dark.

815
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,560
And it's interesting how different 
psychedelics portray this phenomena.

816
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:30,250
But so like on acid you,
I might see,

817
00:39:30,251 --> 00:39:31,990
depending if I'm taking a high enough 
dose,

818
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:36,100
you start seeing like the faces and the 
in the Stucco of your ceiling,

819
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:36,934
you know?
And it's like when you start getting 

820
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:42,430
really depressive or scared,
then the phases start doing like

821
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,383
oh

822
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,090
his thing at you and they seek in and 
they,

823
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:49,350
or even when you're looking at yourself 
in the mirror you,

824
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,223
the a similar things happens is you're 
just watching the way that your 

825
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:54,283
projection that's coming from the 
incessant flow of thoughts in your mind 

826
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,023
is reflecting on the reality itself.
And it's a constant like shifting of 

827
00:40:03,591 --> 00:40:08,210
light that sometimes is like looking 
into the deepest layers of hell.

828
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:11,990
But then sometimes you see the most 
beautiful,

829
00:40:11,991 --> 00:40:16,070
sweet,
incredible things because your not being

830
00:40:16,071 --> 00:40:18,770
freaked out by the flow of thoughts in 
your mind.

831
00:40:18,771 --> 00:40:20,690
That's the number one trick.
You know,

832
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,673
this is why now my old age,
I really do understand why I'm a good 

833
00:40:27,201 --> 00:40:29,180
practice,
meditation,

834
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,710
chanting,
whatever.

835
00:40:30,711 --> 00:40:33,230
It may be pair so nicely with 
psychedelics.

836
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,530
Yeah.
Cause if you have one without the other,

837
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,900
well you're missing out.
But also your,

838
00:40:38,901 --> 00:40:43,430
you can really like go into some pretty 
terrifying places that you'd,

839
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,383
that don't resolve in the way that they 
could potentially if you are doing the 

840
00:40:48,651 --> 00:40:49,484
work,
putting in the time before you take the 

841
00:40:51,021 --> 00:40:52,130
Psychedelic,
you know,

842
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,440
not to sound like an old fucking guy 
like guy you got to,

843
00:40:54,441 --> 00:40:55,274
you do,
you know,

844
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:58,670
meditate and then too,
but it does help a lot.

845
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,733
Well it,
it's,

846
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:00,863
there's a weird way that we,
we want to dismiss it because it seems 

847
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,573
almost like a pompous thing to ever say.
You meditate or you encourage people to 

848
00:41:08,071 --> 00:41:08,904
meds.
Yeah.

849
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,060
Like the same as I always have a cringy 
thing when I tell people to do yoga.

850
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:15,180
Like am I going have to say this again?
What I really mean it.

851
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,223
Like I feel like yoga is one of the very
best things that will pair with a 

852
00:41:19,261 --> 00:41:21,280
cannabis use and with psychedelic.
Sure.

853
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,570
Cause I think it,
it alleviates a lot.

854
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,423
You know,
another thing is really good is running 

855
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,593
and I think both those things,
they alleviate a certain amount of 

856
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:31,870
anxiety and they create,
uh,

857
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,250
they,
there's a blood through that.

858
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,143
Like when you're really pumping hard up 
a hill and you're running the huffing 

859
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:38,594
and puffing and you make it and you 
check your pulse and you recover quick 

860
00:41:41,571 --> 00:41:44,030
and he'd go and do another hill run,
there's a,

861
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:48,320
there's a stimulation of your body 
because it's being forced to work hard,

862
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,303
that's euphoric and after it's over,
your brain's flooded with all these 

863
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:54,620
wonderful chemicals.
You feel good,

864
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,633
you feel friendly.
And like I think that paired with 

865
00:41:58,401 --> 00:41:59,234
psychedelic experiences,
I think exercise is one of the most 

866
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:04,340
overlooked,
so important.

867
00:42:04,341 --> 00:42:07,550
And it doesn't matter what style,
like what you enjoy doing,

868
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,700
but just got to get that blood going.
You got to do something.

869
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:15,940
Whether it's take a spin class or a yoga
class or go for a good hike,

870
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,113
do something where you're fucking 
huffing and puffing and you're really 

871
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:19,934
getting in some work,
you're really sweating and your body 

872
00:42:21,531 --> 00:42:21,980
will just feel

873
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,461
better.
Well,

874
00:42:22,461 --> 00:42:23,294
this is what you just said exactly 
applies to meditation and also you're 

875
00:42:26,721 --> 00:42:27,554
fucking right.
The problem with even talking about it 

876
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:31,630
is you sound virtue signally and pompous
and it sends it.

877
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,260
But,
but it's true.

878
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,930
And when you hear Ron doss talk about 
meditation,

879
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,063
he will say,
I don't meditate when you want to 

880
00:42:39,651 --> 00:42:40,730
meditate.
Like don't,

881
00:42:40,731 --> 00:42:43,760
don't even like if it seems like 
something that appeals to you,

882
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,800
give it a shot.
But the,

883
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,270
the,
the,

884
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,640
the definition of it,
it's sat.

885
00:42:49,641 --> 00:42:52,130
What's funny is when you think about 
meditation,

886
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:57,140
your mind will summon up something that 
you think meditation looks like.

887
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:57,974
So you think,
I mean it's like sitting down on a 

888
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:04,811
cushion with some fucking candles or it 
means like whatever it is that your mind

889
00:43:04,881 --> 00:43:05,714
summons up.
And usually it's pretty austere and 

890
00:43:07,821 --> 00:43:08,654
usually it's pretty requires like a 
temple or a space in your house or it's 

891
00:43:11,751 --> 00:43:15,290
in south and I'll phone you need a robe.
Exactly.

892
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:17,390
He needs some kind of like shit that 
you're wearing,

893
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:19,603
right?
Because your mind is trying to push it 

894
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,480
off.
It's trying to like your mind.

895
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,373
It W it was as one of its functions.
It seems to like not want you to sit 

896
00:43:27,711 --> 00:43:31,820
still for a moment and watch.
But what you just said about exercising,

897
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:32,923
it's true for meditation.
It's like there's so many different 

898
00:43:34,941 --> 00:43:35,774
versions of it.
And I would argue running is a 

899
00:43:38,001 --> 00:43:40,690
meditation.
Working out is a meditation.

900
00:43:40,691 --> 00:43:42,110
Yeah.
And that to think that it's,

901
00:43:42,111 --> 00:43:44,710
there's a separation there.
There really isn't.

902
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:45,920
No,
I don't think there was either.

903
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,130
I always just said that about martial 
arts.

904
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,990
I believe that martial arts were a 
moving form of meditation,

905
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:51,973
but that doesn't mean like stationary 
meditation isn't different and give you 

906
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:55,963
a,
another very valuable thing and a 

907
00:43:57,511 --> 00:43:58,980
different,
a different valuable stuff.

908
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,960
Yeah.
Well it gives you the ability to,

909
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,620
I was just reading,
there's a great book I'm reading by Pema

910
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,620
Chodron called the wisdom and no escape.
And uh,

911
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:12,030
she talks about how when people start 
meditating they think,

912
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:13,343
I'm,
I'm doing this because I want to be a 

913
00:44:14,011 --> 00:44:16,410
better person.
And she said,

914
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,573
that's actually an aggression against 
the south that you are right now to be 

915
00:44:21,361 --> 00:44:22,111
like,
Ooh.

916
00:44:22,111 --> 00:44:24,020
Yeah.
It's interesting.

917
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:24,810
Yeah.
Yeah.

918
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:27,360
That you're actually being like 
aggressive to your own self.

919
00:44:27,361 --> 00:44:32,040
She said meditation is not so that we 
become a better it

920
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,873
so that we're able to be who we are and 
the moment fully and to begin to 

921
00:44:37,711 --> 00:44:42,711
experience fully what it is that's 
happening inside of us because for a lot

922
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:47,940
of people what's going down is that 
there is a dude,

923
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:48,923
this reminds me,
I just watched the Texas fucking 

924
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:51,023
chainsaw massacre.
It's probably like the 16th time I've 

925
00:44:53,641 --> 00:44:56,880
seen it,
but like I watched it and like man,

926
00:44:56,881 --> 00:45:01,881
I had some very strong mentee and like I
was watching it and was like,

927
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:06,120
oh my God,
this is fucking unbearable.

928
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:06,954
Like I can't deal with it.
I'm going to go crazy watching this 

929
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:12,030
fucking thing.
Like the woman who by the end is all bug

930
00:45:12,031 --> 00:45:12,864
eyed and covered in blood and like she's
lost her mind because these Texas 

931
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:19,080
fucking cannibals if like driven her and
saying I'm feeling like that.

932
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,150
But then I realized like,
Oh my God,

933
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,343
that woman running from leather face and
the whole family freaking out and 

934
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:26,934
screaming,
how many people are secretly that woman 

935
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:30,623
inside of themselves constantly running 
in terror from parts of themselves that 

936
00:45:35,071 --> 00:45:37,730
they can't deal with or acknowledge or 
look at.

937
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:41,490
And so,
so meditation is kind of like going into

938
00:45:41,491 --> 00:45:42,324
yourself to that creepy fucking ranch 
house in the middle of nowhere in your 

939
00:45:47,101 --> 00:45:52,101
heart and then exploring the places that
you don't want to go into him up.

940
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:56,220
You know what man?
It's as it's feeling them,

941
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,970
it's instead of cleaning or fixing or 
repairing,

942
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:03,900
it's going in there and feeling the 
whatever it is.

943
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,350
For a lot of people it's just grief,
pain,

944
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:09,480
sorrow,
regret,

945
00:46:09,481 --> 00:46:10,680
regret,
you know,

946
00:46:10,681 --> 00:46:12,210
and it's going in there and not being 
like,

947
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,073
I'm going to fix what I fucked up seven 
years ago because this is not time 

948
00:46:16,771 --> 00:46:17,604
travel.
But what I'm going to do is for 10 

949
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:21,660
minutes,
five minutes,

950
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:22,853
I'm going to let myself feel this thing 
that I've been trying not to feel by 

951
00:46:26,671 --> 00:46:31,671
distracting myself with an incessant 
flow of thoughts and that that is,

952
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:33,983
that is when you start lightening up a 
little bit because really all you gotta 

953
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:37,673
do is feel as they,
I think the maps people say feeling is 

954
00:46:41,731 --> 00:46:42,564
healing.

955
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:44,610
Have you ever heard that?
No,

956
00:46:44,611 --> 00:46:46,950
but I think it have,
but the thing was like a kid show.

957
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:53,150
That's a great kid show.
It shows him some good shit to do,

958
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,140
man.
We're on the ball.

959
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:56,610
Yeah.
Yeah.

960
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,080
You know there's some kid's movies that 
are oddly psychedelic dude.

961
00:47:01,081 --> 00:47:01,730
Are you kidding?
Like,

962
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:03,360
oh,
kids are psychedelic,

963
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,233
like to appeal to a child.
It's like you do have to create some 

964
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,673
crazy shit.
You know what kids show isn't find me a 

965
00:47:13,801 --> 00:47:17,880
kid show that isn't the most psychedelic
thing,

966
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:19,230
including Mr.
Rogers.

967
00:47:19,231 --> 00:47:20,820
Like Mr.
Rogers is like,

968
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:23,040
that's some trippy shit going down 
there,

969
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:23,874
man.
Wow.

970
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:26,310
Trippy.
It's funny that you bring up Mr.

971
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,143
Rogers because here's what,
one of the things that I was going to 

972
00:47:28,081 --> 00:47:30,160
say when we're talking about gun control

973
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,740
and violence and all the different 
issues in this world,

974
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:38,640
what one thing that we don't concentrate
on is promoting being nicer.

975
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:40,180
Yeah.
Like,

976
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:43,090
no,
no government official does that.

977
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,820
Presidents don't do that.
They don't get on TV.

978
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:49,510
They sort of say it,
we need to work together,

979
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:51,340
but they don't.
They don't ever say,

980
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,233
folks,
we just got to figure out how it'd be 

981
00:47:53,201 --> 00:47:56,290
nice to each other like,
do we not in conflict anymore,

982
00:47:56,291 --> 00:48:00,990
but we're designed for conflict and 
here's how you get rid of that golf.

983
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:03,610
Get a fucking heavy bag.
Go Run hills,

984
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,980
go to yoga class,
eat better.

985
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:10,840
Stop drinking so much coffee or alcohol 
or sugar or whatever your,

986
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:12,880
your vices.
That's fucking with your body.

987
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:16,510
Get you.
Get your body in order and get your mind

988
00:48:16,511 --> 00:48:18,310
in order and just be nicer to each 
other.

989
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:23,610
That would fix almost everything.
If people just overall decided,

990
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:25,540
you know what,
Male,

991
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:27,400
female,
whatever the fuck,

992
00:48:27,401 --> 00:48:30,310
whoever you're talking to,
just let's just be nicer to each other.

993
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:31,061
Yeah,
let's just,

994
00:48:31,061 --> 00:48:32,980
everybody do this.
Can we all just work on this?

995
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:36,370
No one's saying work on this.
Like there's no government officials.

996
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,620
There's no big state of the Union 
address and go,

997
00:48:38,621 --> 00:48:39,454
ladies and gentlemen,
our problems that we have with each 

998
00:48:40,331 --> 00:48:41,051
other,
ridiculous.

999
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:44,260
We're family here.
We're brothers and sisters and we're all

1000
00:48:44,261 --> 00:48:46,240
immigrants.
Every single one of us as an immigrant.

1001
00:48:46,241 --> 00:48:47,680
I'm not saying we should let everybody 
in,

1002
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:50,140
but whoever's here,
you made it bitch.

1003
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,393
He made it.
As long as you're not a God damn 

1004
00:48:51,851 --> 00:48:52,930
criminal,
you made it.

1005
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,213
Woo.
So growth the tax dollars and get taxes 

1006
00:48:57,791 --> 00:48:58,760
from him.
Also,

1007
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:01,990
don't forget we're all immigrants coming
from infinity to,

1008
00:49:01,991 --> 00:49:02,824
exactly.
We're all immigrants who've come in to 

1009
00:49:04,151 --> 00:49:04,984
this dimension and have complete Amnesia
as to what was going on for the last 13 

1010
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:12,070
out of a vagina.
All of a sudden you're American.

1011
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,480
Yeah,
that's it.

1012
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,440
We're all immigrants and,
and,

1013
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:16,910
and I hear about this.
I can,

1014
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:18,100
I'm starting to run now,
but I have to tell you,

1015
00:49:18,101 --> 00:49:19,570
this does your,
about this Canadian couple.

1016
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,433
There's a gay couple that a had twins 
and they did it through a surrogate and 

1017
00:49:24,821 --> 00:49:25,654
they,
they mixed up their ges so that no one 

1018
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,510
knew,
which,

1019
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:29,680
you know,
who's just was who's,

1020
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:30,623
well,
one guy's an American citizen and one 

1021
00:49:32,051 --> 00:49:33,400
guy's not.
Yeah.

1022
00:49:33,401 --> 00:49:34,234
So the kids were born and they did a DNA
test on the kids cause they wanted to 

1023
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:42,220
find out whether or not one of those 
kids was a dirty Canadian.

1024
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:43,423
Turns out one of them is trying to sneak
over our borders at one day old fuck 

1025
00:49:48,011 --> 00:49:48,844
off.
So they set that little fucking 

1026
00:49:50,891 --> 00:49:51,724
terrorist back to Canada.
Gay couple married in Canada sues US 

1027
00:49:55,211 --> 00:49:57,670
government for denying citizens to the 
child.

1028
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:01,780
Hey assholes.
Let these fucking people come back.

1029
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,673
Jesus Christ understand man.
Like people like jeff sessions see a 

1030
00:50:05,861 --> 00:50:06,694
picture like that and they feel like 
they're looking at somebody taking a 

1031
00:50:09,491 --> 00:50:12,340
dump on a crucifix.
Like for a lot of these people,

1032
00:50:12,341 --> 00:50:15,610
they can't handle the idea of gay people
having kids.

1033
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,680
It's not like they're worried about 
citizenship.

1034
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:21,580
It's like a lot of these gnarled Fox who
are running things.

1035
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:24,110
They're terrified of gay people.
You know,

1036
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:24,940
that's,
it's,

1037
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:27,040
I'm sure that you ever made that 
decision.

1038
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,100
It wasn't anything

1039
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:28,791
to do with like,
oh,

1040
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:30,950
this is citizenship laws.
It was like,

1041
00:50:30,951 --> 00:50:31,784
hey man,
we're not going to have this futuristic 

1042
00:50:34,161 --> 00:50:38,660
shit where we're doing some kind of ges 
co Combos here.

1043
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:41,310
We're not doing TJ's combos.
And my country just used

1044
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:45,340
one of those little a paintbrush.
Those things you stir with,

1045
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:46,203
you know,
like if you want to make a butter 

1046
00:50:47,801 --> 00:50:49,110
coffee,
here's a little blurb.

1047
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,790
Oh,
is gonna Lecture Electric Away?

1048
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,580
That's what they do.
They just into like a mixing jug.

1049
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:01,030
How they use a fucking,
they use like smoothie machines,

1050
00:51:01,031 --> 00:51:01,730
man.
They just,

1051
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:02,950
sure positive.

1052
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:05,390
A buddy of mine was telling me today 
about,

1053
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:06,510
um,
uh,

1054
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:09,140
he was in Berlin and when he went to 
this,

1055
00:51:09,141 --> 00:51:12,170
there's this club and they had three 
different floors of this club.

1056
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:17,320
Like one floor was like a hardcore,
like punk scene or you know,

1057
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:19,423
electronic scene or something like that.
And then below it was a hardcore gay 

1058
00:51:23,631 --> 00:51:24,860
club.
Heard of this class,

1059
00:51:24,861 --> 00:51:25,694
hardcore gay club.
They would have shit night where they 

1060
00:51:28,581 --> 00:51:31,400
would shit in the tub where and seal it 
up and bring it in there.

1061
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,473
They would just all over the stage and 
they would dive on the ges like a slip 

1062
00:51:35,421 --> 00:51:36,254
and slide and slide around on each 
other's Tj's they'd piss on each other 

1063
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,453
and this is just,

1064
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,090
well I get the ges and the pests,
do you,

1065
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:47,400
but help me understand this shit.
That tupperware shit thing.

1066
00:51:47,401 --> 00:51:50,040
Like the problem is I opened up with the
top worst shit.

1067
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:51,870
I went too hard off the gate.
I should've,

1068
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:52,973
I should've dialed I shit.
I should have started with Jizz on the 

1069
00:51:56,041 --> 00:51:56,874
deck and then they slip and slide then 
work their way up to piss nine each 

1070
00:51:59,341 --> 00:52:01,860
other and then these crazy motherfuckers
started bringing in shit.

1071
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:04,080
That's what I should have done.
But when I don't understand,

1072
00:52:04,081 --> 00:52:07,440
it's like they're like the slip inside 
slide.

1073
00:52:07,441 --> 00:52:07,981
It's like,
yeah,

1074
00:52:07,981 --> 00:52:08,814
you know it's like fucking fun night.
You're like enjoying like some physical 

1075
00:52:11,881 --> 00:52:12,714
found with your paths,
but like why are you bringing in like 

1076
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:18,690
shit and Tupperware?
Like what's the like smell and shit?

1077
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,120
They're like smelling each other's shit.
So you're just like,

1078
00:52:21,121 --> 00:52:21,954
hey,
take a whiff of this great shit I had 

1079
00:52:23,281 --> 00:52:23,790
the other day.

1080
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:26,010
Well,
do you know how some guys like the smell

1081
00:52:26,011 --> 00:52:28,740
of their woman's vagina?
They want to get in there and smell it.

1082
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:31,920
You know,
I wonder how much those connected,

1083
00:52:31,921 --> 00:52:32,754
cause that's where you put your Dick.
I wonder if you put your Dick and butts 

1084
00:52:35,551 --> 00:52:36,630
all the time.
He'd be like,

1085
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:39,210
I want to smell your shit.
Oh,

1086
00:52:39,211 --> 00:52:43,260
like it's associated with light or 
reminds you of fucking or something.

1087
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,910
Mike,
this is what I want you to do.

1088
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,700
I want you to shit a tupperware and 
bring it over.

1089
00:52:47,701 --> 00:52:49,240
Are you serious?
Jim?

1090
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:50,610
Want you to shit?
Nothing.

1091
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,320
Bring it over and don't wipe your ass.
Tupperware.

1092
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:56,710
Like why not foil?
Hmm.

1093
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:57,870
Who knows,
man?

1094
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:00,840
I mean you'd have to be really fucked up
to want to smell someone shit.

1095
00:53:00,841 --> 00:53:02,760
That pad.
Yeah.

1096
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:06,660
Smell each other's shit.
Maybe it's just like a naughty thing.

1097
00:53:06,661 --> 00:53:07,590
Like we're being naughty.

1098
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:09,510
Smell my shit.
Yeah.

1099
00:53:09,511 --> 00:53:12,140
Or I'm transporting shit like you're 
like I'm,

1100
00:53:12,141 --> 00:53:14,310
I'm,
I'm bringing shit somewhere.

1101
00:53:14,311 --> 00:53:17,610
Like I'm bringing a lunch to this place.
It's by the way,

1102
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:20,390
I've heard of this club man.
My friend was telling me about this car.

1103
00:53:20,391 --> 00:53:22,260
I don't know if it's the same club.
I think it is.

1104
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,740
I've been hearing all this shit about 
bad ass.

1105
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:25,583
Berlin is man that it's just like crazy 
over there and that this one club my 

1106
00:53:29,131 --> 00:53:32,430
friend was telling me she went to,
everyone stands in line.

1107
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:35,160
There's no VIP.
Yes.

1108
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,053
Everyone stands in line like part of the
experience of the things you stand in 

1109
00:53:38,101 --> 00:53:41,700
line for like a long time and there's 
one bouncer,

1110
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:45,870
he's giant.
He's like this giant scary German guy.

1111
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:46,733
I think he's got like a glass eye or 
some Jesus and he's scans you so you 

1112
00:53:51,001 --> 00:53:56,001
stand in front of him and he looks at 
you and like does some kind of soul scan

1113
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,173
and if he decides you're ready to 
experience the psychic effects of 

1114
00:54:01,441 --> 00:54:02,274
witnessing dude's sliding through calm 
because you know for some feet cause 

1115
00:54:06,541 --> 00:54:09,840
it's not as though he's trying to like 
he's obviously trying to keep it cool in

1116
00:54:09,841 --> 00:54:10,340
there.

1117
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,450
Right.
But he's also trying to keep people from

1118
00:54:12,451 --> 00:54:13,284
losing their minds because like the one 
wrong person goes into the sub basement 

1119
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,393
and sees a bunch of people huffing 
tupperwares shit and doing like do you 

1120
00:54:20,521 --> 00:54:21,354
know and the sliding through jazz,
you know that could be like a push you 

1121
00:54:26,191 --> 00:54:29,610
over the line that could lead you 
straight to fucking mail bomb land.

1122
00:54:29,611 --> 00:54:30,444
You could just end up in a cabin 
building devices of destruct that it's 

1123
00:54:34,711 --> 00:54:35,630
probably happened to kids.
Then

1124
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:38,280
if you took any of the people from the 
trump,

1125
00:54:38,281 --> 00:54:39,114
he bear commercial and put them in that 
gay club while those guys are smelling 

1126
00:54:42,581 --> 00:54:45,760
each other's shit and Tupperwares and 
jizzing on the floor and pissing on each

1127
00:54:45,761 --> 00:54:48,160
other cause they just wandered into 
their accidentally.

1128
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:51,580
They'd all start fucking probably.
Have you seen that video?

1129
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:54,430
The trumpy bear?
I put it on my instagram last night.

1130
00:54:54,431 --> 00:54:55,264
I was watching tv in this fucking thing 
came on and it's like a tim and Eric 

1131
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,140
Sketch.
What is it?

1132
00:54:59,141 --> 00:54:59,974
It's like a,
it's a real commercial for real stuffed 

1133
00:55:01,601 --> 00:55:03,160
animal.
Look at this.

1134
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:05,570
The trump be bear.
No,

1135
00:55:05,571 --> 00:55:06,700
no.
You got to see the video though.

1136
00:55:06,701 --> 00:55:07,870
Can you play the video?
Oh,

1137
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,280
just go to my instagram.
Wow,

1138
00:55:09,281 --> 00:55:10,950
that's cool.
I'll put the video up on my ears.

1139
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:12,490
Oh,
that's it in the upper corner.

1140
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:14,860
Make that larger and give me some 
volume.

1141
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,200
Listen to this.
Listen to this though.

1142
00:55:17,201 --> 00:55:22,201
Great American grizzly.
Introducing the original trumpy baby.

1143
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:26,050
This is real fearless.
Super plus American.

1144
00:55:26,051 --> 00:55:26,884
Now tell me,
this doesn't seem like a tim and Eric 

1145
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:28,481
Sketch.
Watch.

1146
00:55:28,481 --> 00:55:31,060
Watch how this goes on.
Just fine.

1147
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:32,860
The secrets zipper and bull out

1148
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:41,430
that's actually getting one of these.
It gets crazier.

1149
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,520
Watch on flag day and on any American 
holiday.

1150
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:47,280
God bless America.
God bless.

1151
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:49,200
Trumpy dare.
Trumpy bear suits.

1152
00:55:49,201 --> 00:55:50,034
Probably little cycle for all the 
world's a see at loves to cruise with 

1153
00:55:53,701 --> 00:55:54,534
his brother.

He bear ride by my side.

1155
00:55:58,470 --> 00:55:59,910
Fuck yeah.
Once a marine,

1156
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,770
always a marine.
Everyone.

1157
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:05,730
Goddamn Tim and Eric Sketch Golf course.
Look at this and I ride with trump.

1158
00:56:05,731 --> 00:56:08,190
He married.
He makes my golf game great again.

1159
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:09,433
Trump,
you bear the bear can pop up the style 

1160
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,630
of this trademark and policing the Munis
paper chair.

1161
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,210
I love it.
Those guys will love trump.

1162
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:19,980
He did a tough one.
Thank you.

1163
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:22,410
Bear business is great for businesses.
Great.

1164
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:23,653
I,
I'm great.

1165
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:24,070
I

1166
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:25,280
love you trump.
You bear.

1167
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:26,413
I am.
I am proud to own the trumpy bear and I 

1168
00:56:29,651 --> 00:56:32,440
will always be proud to be an American.

1169
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:33,800
Wait,
hold on.

1170
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:34,541
That guy.
Hold on.

1171
00:56:34,541 --> 00:56:35,650
Hold on.
This is fake.

1172
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:38,080
Did you see that guy's name?
Is War a holic?

1173
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,990
That's frank.
That's frank war.

1174
00:56:40,991 --> 00:56:45,991
Holic like an alcoholic for war.
Go back for bro Frank War.

1175
00:56:46,401 --> 00:56:48,400
Holic that's a gag.
This thing's a gag.

1176
00:56:48,401 --> 00:56:48,760
Do that.

1177
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,880
But it's on the radio or it's on TV 
rather.

1178
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:53,020
It's kind of a gag.
I looked it up after last night.

1179
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:54,830
It is for sale.
It a real products,

1180
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:55,600
real products.
So,

1181
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,120
but so this is,
it's a comedy sketch.

1182
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,140
I kind of knew it had to be.
Yeah.

1183
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,720
There's no way it could be that bad.
Yeah.

1184
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:03,100
Oh my God.
I know what it is.

1185
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:04,623
They've made a comedy sketch that's 
comedy for people like anybody who's 

1186
00:57:08,741 --> 00:57:09,574
paying attention,
but for people so dumb that they don't 

1187
00:57:13,391 --> 00:57:14,224
realize it's a comedy sketch and they,
they think the way the people in the 

1188
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:18,850
video thing.
Yeah.

1189
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:21,100
It's like a honeypot for dumb dumbs.
Yeah.

1190
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:24,670
It's brilliant because on one level it's
like a really funny sketch.

1191
00:57:24,671 --> 00:57:27,040
On the other level,
it's just like people like God damn,

1192
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:30,160
I've always wanted a trumpy bear.
So they make this bear,

1193
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:31,023
they sell this bear.
They pretend that they're all patriotic 

1194
00:57:32,891 --> 00:57:34,510
and they just made the dump.
Of course it is.

1195
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:36,460
What's wrong with me?
I am the storm.

1196
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:38,920
Of course it's fake.
I was pretty sad,

1197
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,960
but this is the world we're living in 
right now.

1198
00:57:40,961 --> 00:57:43,540
I believed it was real because it is a 
real product,

1199
00:57:43,541 --> 00:57:44,374
but when the lady pulled out or flag,
I've got a little suspicious and then 

1200
00:57:47,411 --> 00:57:48,820
the other guy says,
once a marine,

1201
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,900
always a marine.
I'm like,

1202
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,240
this is a tim and Eric Sketch.

1203
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,800
Pretty subtle man.
Like I like it.

1204
00:57:55,801 --> 00:57:56,634
Definitely.
I've seen commercials that Shitty for 

1205
00:57:58,621 --> 00:57:59,454
sure.

1206
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:02,240
Trumpy bear official.
There he is.

1207
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,850
Once Maroon.
Oh,

1208
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,190
a marine.
Look at my boot.

1209
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,910
It's dirty because I work.

1210
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,700
What do you,
what do you think?

1211
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:09,380
You know,
we're,

1212
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:10,200
we,
we're,

1213
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,033
we make really shitty predictions 
whenever I come on your show about 

1214
00:58:13,081 --> 00:58:16,500
what's going to happen usually,
but what do you think is going to happen

1215
00:58:16,501 --> 00:58:17,790
with Mueller and trump?

1216
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:22,380
I have zero idea.
I'm fascinated by the whole process.

1217
00:58:22,381 --> 00:58:26,490
I'm fascinated by his disdain for the 
intelligence intelligence community.

1218
00:58:26,491 --> 00:58:30,000
That to me seems to be like in one of 
the craziest things a presence ever done

1219
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,313
is like literally have beef with the FBI
to the point where the FBI foils a 

1220
00:58:36,001 --> 00:58:36,834
terrorist attack in San Francisco and 
the present doesn't even mention it on 

1221
00:58:40,111 --> 00:58:41,520
tv,
doesn't praise them.

1222
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:42,553
Does it make a big deal about how good 
our government is that we've been able 

1223
00:58:45,691 --> 00:58:46,524
to stop these terrorists?
This is one of the reasons why I wanted 

1224
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:50,850
to build this wall in the first place 
and tighten up illegal immigration.

1225
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:51,753
Yeah.
This is an opportunity to prove his 

1226
00:58:52,261 --> 00:58:55,470
point and he doesn't talk about it cause
he's,

1227
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,500
he's got a beef,
got beef with the FBI.

1228
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:01,210
Do you remember when the FBI agent came 
to your show?

1229
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:03,160
Do you remember that when that happened?
Yeah,

1230
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:07,280
that was one of the weirdest.
That was like really weird for me.

1231
00:59:07,281 --> 00:59:08,114
It was a weird,
because the dude like the way he did it 

1232
00:59:10,361 --> 00:59:13,690
was perfect because he got like,
it made my heart leap because he's like,

1233
00:59:13,691 --> 00:59:14,524
he like,
like he had his hand on my arm and like 

1234
00:59:16,691 --> 00:59:18,280
a cop style,
you know what I mean?

1235
00:59:18,281 --> 00:59:19,114
Like,
and then he like lifted his shirt up to 

1236
00:59:21,111 --> 00:59:23,990
show his FBI badge.
And I'm like,

1237
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,510
well,
I don't know exactly what it was,

1238
00:59:26,511 --> 00:59:27,344
but I mean,
I could probably imagine a few things 

1239
00:59:28,311 --> 00:59:33,311
you might be arresting me for.
But then he was like,

1240
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:36,650
then he was like really cool and he's 
like,

1241
00:59:36,651 --> 00:59:38,270
listen to your podcast.
And he's like,

1242
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,450
you know,
he's like,

1243
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:41,510
he was just being really awesome.

1244
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:42,553
Listen man,
you need those people and everybody 

1245
00:59:43,611 --> 00:59:44,444
doesn't think they need those people.
You have an unrealistic view of the 

1246
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:47,520
world.
You need sheep,

1247
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:49,070
dog.
You need them.

1248
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:50,083
You need people to watch the criminals.
You need two people to be able to solve 

1249
00:59:53,211 --> 00:59:54,044
crimes.
You need people to be able to stop 

1250
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,430
terrorist attacks like they did in San 
Francisco.

1251
00:59:58,431 --> 01:00:01,130
You need them right and muddy dinks it.
They don't need him.

1252
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,510
Look,
I wish we didn't need them.

1253
01:00:02,511 --> 01:00:05,540
I wish we had a perfect relationship 
with all the other nations and everybody

1254
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:08,840
just decided to work together for the 
survival of the species as a whole.

1255
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:12,950
And we weren't.
So concentrating on a owning resources,

1256
01:00:12,951 --> 01:00:16,100
taking over governments and controlling 
parts of the world that have,

1257
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,500
you know,
things that we're trying to steal or get

1258
01:00:18,501 --> 01:00:22,070
or buy.
But it is so as long as it is,

1259
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:25,040
you're going to need the FBI,
you're going to need intelligence,

1260
01:00:25,041 --> 01:00:26,250
community,
you're gonna need the army.

1261
01:00:26,251 --> 01:00:28,640
You didn't need the navy getting these 
marines going to need the air force,

1262
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,610
but don't the FBI,
the police,

1263
01:00:30,611 --> 01:00:31,940
the police like that.
Br,

1264
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:33,310
the polices bullies

1265
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:34,703
and that's,
and there's a checks and balance system 

1266
01:00:36,211 --> 01:00:37,590
that's been proven.
Now,

1267
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:42,480
I don't agree with this because I think 
this is a crazy reason to fire a guy,

1268
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:45,810
especially a guy who was a war hero,
but General Patraeus,

1269
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:46,973
he his whole thing,
he got busted because the FBI was 

1270
01:00:49,141 --> 01:00:49,974
looking into something.
The FBI was looking into something and 

1271
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:57,300
got the head of the CIA in trouble.
So they go after each other.

1272
01:00:57,370 --> 01:00:58,203
Wow.
So there's kind of a competitive thing 

1273
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:02,670
currently heared yeah,
sometimes they don't get along.

1274
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:03,713
Sometimes the CIA and the FBI,
they don't see eye to eye on certain 

1275
01:01:05,911 --> 01:01:06,744
things.
But this one was a weird one because it 

1276
01:01:07,981 --> 01:01:08,814
was about an affair.
It's like of all the shit that he did 

1277
01:01:10,651 --> 01:01:12,450
bad,
like he had an affair.

1278
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:17,310
I just guys out there,
right smashing worlds with these.

1279
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:19,370
What is the mother of all bombs with 
though?

1280
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:21,030
The fucker?
He didn't lunch that one.

1281
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,043
That was after his time,
but they launched all kinds of crazy 

1282
01:01:24,451 --> 01:01:25,590
bombs over there,
right?

1283
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:29,220
I mean they're just shooting drones.
The fossils.

1284
01:01:29,221 --> 01:01:30,054
That's all good.
I heard he put your penis inside of the 

1285
01:01:32,131 --> 01:01:33,330
wrong person,
dude,

1286
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:35,280
that she lecture.
It's crazy.

1287
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:36,143
Oh,
we're going to investigate where your 

1288
01:01:36,911 --> 01:01:37,661
penis is.
Pig.

1289
01:01:37,661 --> 01:01:40,830
You dirty dirty boy in between killen 
strangers.

1290
01:01:40,831 --> 01:01:41,664
You're out there.
Yeah,

1291
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:42,713
she's the wrong person.
We can take all the accidental drowning 

1292
01:01:46,531 --> 01:01:50,490
deaths you got for us.
We can't take as you shoot.

1293
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:51,241
Okay.
Dirty,

1294
01:01:51,241 --> 01:01:56,241
dirty semen inside another woman.
You will only express love for one woman

1295
01:01:56,311 --> 01:02:00,210
in this world that it,
you can only feel up for one person at a

1296
01:02:00,211 --> 01:02:04,230
time and you're definitely not going to 
put that general cock and anyone else.

1297
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,840
But Lydia Petraeus,
your why.

1298
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:12,780
Oh sorry.
So fucked up a function so fucked up.

1299
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,450
It's so sad.
It's so stupid.

1300
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,070
It's scary.
Like what?

1301
01:02:17,071 --> 01:02:18,780
The guy didn't want to fuck his wife 
anymore.

1302
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,070
That's a problem

1303
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,090
between them.
Yeah.

1304
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:24,880
This has nothing to do with us.
Is He still a good general?

1305
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,040
Nothing.
Yeah,

1306
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:28,980
it's terrifying.
I mean that's really where we enter into

1307
01:02:28,981 --> 01:02:31,740
the land of absurdity because this is 
where it got really observe.

1308
01:02:31,770 --> 01:02:32,603
Like you know people that think that 
there's some grand scheme to protect 

1309
01:02:35,011 --> 01:02:37,980
people and protect generals.
A dude,

1310
01:02:37,981 --> 01:02:41,340
there's video of him when he was walking
from city college in New York where he's

1311
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:42,174
teaching and he'd have to walk down the 
street where he was going and the 

1312
01:02:44,521 --> 01:02:47,850
students were surrounding him,
screaming at him,

1313
01:02:47,851 --> 01:02:51,360
calling him a war criminal and he did it
constantly is teaching there.

1314
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:53,580
Wow.
Follow him from and he,

1315
01:02:53,581 --> 01:02:54,414
and they're filming us for the cash of 
the cameras are filming them and then 

1316
01:02:56,221 --> 01:02:57,930
people around him like,
fuck you,

1317
01:02:58,460 --> 01:02:59,293
cute.
And he's,

1318
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:01,290
he's on his own dude.
He's helpless.

1319
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:03,240
If somebody just,
they just jump them.

1320
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:04,950
They just jumped him.
No one's stopping them.

1321
01:03:04,951 --> 01:03:08,910
I thought people like that had like 
internal guards or something.

1322
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:09,960
Turns out,
nope.

1323
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:11,310
Turns out,
nope.

1324
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:13,620
No Shit.
Cast that guy aside.

1325
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:14,993
I mean,
I don't know if they've rectified the 

1326
01:03:15,601 --> 01:03:18,960
situation after that day,
but that day he is by himself.

1327
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:20,280
Look at this.
Turn it up.

1328
01:03:20,281 --> 01:03:21,720
Give you some volume on.
This is crazy.

1329
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:32,650
It's crazy blood all over.

1330
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:40,003
Hey,
this hyperboles not necessarily holy 

1331
01:03:41,481 --> 01:03:42,314
shit.
It's crazy to imagine that guy sexting 

1332
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,620
sucks the fuck out at some lady.
Ooh.

1333
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:51,740
Like a missile son at home.
Here's a bunker buster.

1334
01:03:53,770 --> 01:03:55,210
When he comes,
he whispers scenario.

1335
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:56,910
Ooh,
Ooh,

1336
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:59,470
Ooh,
Ooh.

1337
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:04,650
It curls up back man.
Let her see.

1338
01:04:06,270 --> 01:04:07,103
Hmm.

1339
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:10,530
Yeah,
they leave,

1340
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:12,810
but they left a guy alone.
That's what's interesting.

1341
01:04:12,811 --> 01:04:16,020
Then you would think that the,
the amount of influence that guy had,

1342
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:16,741
the,
the,

1343
01:04:16,741 --> 01:04:18,930
I mean that guy was one of the top 
generals,

1344
01:04:18,931 --> 01:04:20,760
if not the top general in the country,
right?

1345
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:22,223
Wasn't it?
Yeah.

1346
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:23,603
I mean he was a huge war hero.
There's been two instances of shit like 

1347
01:04:26,941 --> 01:04:28,500
that happening.
Where,

1348
01:04:28,501 --> 01:04:29,334
um,
the other one was the Michael Hastings 

1349
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:31,170
one.
Do you remember that one?

1350
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:34,260
Vaguely.
This is a fascinating one.

1351
01:04:34,261 --> 01:04:36,570
If you really want to fire up your 
conspiracy theory,

1352
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:42,330
really want to turn a pitch tonight.
Michael Hastings was a journalist who,

1353
01:04:42,331 --> 01:04:43,740
uh,
was embedded,

1354
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,710
I believe it was in Iraq.
It might've been an Afghanistan,

1355
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:49,620
but he was a embedded in the Middle East
somewhere.

1356
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,330
And,
uh,

1357
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:53,010
something happened.
Oh,

1358
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,070
that volcano erupted.
Remember when that volcano erupted?

1359
01:04:56,071 --> 01:04:58,860
And they canceled all air flight for a 
long time.

1360
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:03,570
He was trapped over there with that and 
they got way too comfortable with him.

1361
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,480
And so they started talking around this 
journalist,

1362
01:05:06,481 --> 01:05:09,960
the way they always talk and they,
and he was joking around about Obama and

1363
01:05:09,961 --> 01:05:10,794
make it fun of Obama and they said a 
bunch of shit they probably shouldn't 

1364
01:05:13,411 --> 01:05:14,244
have said,
but that just what fucking soldiers say 

1365
01:05:15,751 --> 01:05:18,010
when they're over there risking their 
lights or something,

1366
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:18,843
they probably don't even understand.
You would want them to believe this is 

1367
01:05:20,741 --> 01:05:21,850
all for a good cost.
Right?

1368
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:22,713
You would want them to believe 
everything that they're general tells 

1369
01:05:24,521 --> 01:05:26,770
them if they got a fucking crack,
some jokes,

1370
01:05:26,771 --> 01:05:27,604
the president's expense to alleviate a 
little stress while we're out there 

1371
01:05:30,011 --> 01:05:31,360
killing strangers.
Yeah,

1372
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:34,210
no UN,
an intolerable,

1373
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:35,133
intolerable,
mocking the leader of the free world 

1374
01:05:37,811 --> 01:05:39,220
while you're out there killing 
strangers,

1375
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:41,770
you can't do that.
So he made this guy resigned.

1376
01:05:41,830 --> 01:05:42,663
So here's where it gets crazy.
Michael Hastings starts telling 

1377
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:46,331
everybody,
look,

1378
01:05:46,331 --> 01:05:48,280
my life is in danger.
He's like,

1379
01:05:48,281 --> 01:05:50,140
people are threatening my life on a 
daily basis.

1380
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:51,003
If anything happens to me.
I did not commit suicide cut to him 

1381
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:55,713
driving down,
I think it was sunset car going 

1382
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:01,000
uncontrollably fast slamming into a 
tree.

1383
01:06:01,001 --> 01:06:05,080
The car exploding the engine flying from
the car.

1384
01:06:05,081 --> 01:06:07,090
Yeah,
he's dead as fuck.

1385
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:08,163
They find amphetamines in his system.
But that's adderall because that's what 

1386
01:06:10,571 --> 01:06:12,820
all journalists are on there.
All on adderall.

1387
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:14,220
Right.
So they tried it all the,

1388
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:18,180
I was on methamphetamines when he drove 
into a tree case salts.

1389
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,020
Classic job,
Dick Tracy.

1390
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:21,670
Yeah,
let's just forget about it.

1391
01:06:21,671 --> 01:06:23,680
We connected the dots.
It was quite easy.

1392
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:24,933
Meanwhile,
there's people that have said with 

1393
01:06:27,041 --> 01:06:29,650
absolute certainty that with today's 
cars,

1394
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:30,603
it is incredibly possible.
Absolutely credibly possible to control 

1395
01:06:36,581 --> 01:06:41,230
the car from a remote place and make the
car do what you want it,

1396
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:43,160
dude,
definitely.

1397
01:06:43,190 --> 01:06:44,210
Definitely,
definitely,

1398
01:06:44,211 --> 01:06:45,530
definitely.
But we,

1399
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:49,100
I mean this is,
I love this line of this direction we're

1400
01:06:49,101 --> 01:06:50,690
going in here man,
because you,

1401
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:54,360
it's great because it's like this to me 
where it gets really,

1402
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:57,830
remember that thing that people would 
always say that government is always,

1403
01:06:57,831 --> 01:07:00,020
what is it five years ahead,
seven years ahead.

1404
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:05,740
I have it tattooed on my ass.
Did you get it at a nightclub in Berlin?

1405
01:07:08,001 --> 01:07:09,800
You got to know the government's ahead 
bro.

1406
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,830
Huh?
But it's true.

1407
01:07:11,831 --> 01:07:13,540
It's true.
All that money that they have.

1408
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:14,523
So where where it gets really 
interesting is when you start thinking 

1409
01:07:17,981 --> 01:07:18,814
about what that means in relation to 
like computer intelligence and ai and 

1410
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:27,160
you start realizing like,
man,

1411
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:32,080
whatever the shit is that they have 
access to at this point compared to what

1412
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:32,914
we think they have access to is so 
powerful and so dangerous that anybody 

1413
01:07:40,541 --> 01:07:43,600
who they want to take out,
anybody they want to take out,

1414
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:45,940
they can take out.
That's a problem.

1415
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:46,890
It's okay.

1416
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:49,440
That's a problem.
Having anybody to have that much power,

1417
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:52,110
especially over the rest of us.
It's bad for them.

1418
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:52,973
You know,
and Kennedy talked about this when he 

1419
01:07:53,821 --> 01:07:54,654
was in office,
he talks about secret societies and and 

1420
01:07:57,421 --> 01:07:59,790
keeping secrets from people.
And it's just generally,

1421
01:07:59,791 --> 01:08:02,160
it's a bad idea across the board for 
humans.

1422
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:04,020
It's just bad for our human nature and 
to,

1423
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,180
for groups to have ultimate power of 
surveillance.

1424
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,550
It would just look into your life.
It's odd.

1425
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:09,900
I mean,
Edward Snowden proved it.

1426
01:08:09,901 --> 01:08:10,860
It's,
it's obviously,

1427
01:08:10,861 --> 01:08:13,020
it's too easy.
It's too easy for people that work there

1428
01:08:13,021 --> 01:08:14,940
to check on the ex girlfriends who the 
fucking up.

1429
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:16,100
I just have one to read your email.

1430
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:16,963
Do you think there is secret societies 
out there that we're not really aware 

1431
01:08:19,941 --> 01:08:21,890
of?
Well,

1432
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,720
if they're secret societies that we're 
aware of,

1433
01:08:23,721 --> 01:08:26,630
that's because someone along the line 
open their fucking trap.

1434
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:27,553
Sure.
And they let us know about a secret 

1435
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:29,804
society.
That's how we found out about skull and 

1436
01:08:30,621 --> 01:08:31,454
bones.
Right.

1437
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,440
One of those posts he's told their mom,
yeah,

1438
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:35,130
you know,
you made me sweat.

1439
01:08:35,131 --> 01:08:36,110
Could dig.
And they filmed.

1440
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:37,250
Yeah.
No,

1441
01:08:37,251 --> 01:08:38,084
I'm in the order.
Isn't it like a glass coffin like glass 

1442
01:08:40,371 --> 01:08:42,950
Dick Saca glass,
second glass Dick.

1443
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:43,880
I thought,
no way.

1444
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:47,330
Not your way in a glass cottage is on 
you and they just on the glass,

1445
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:48,193
like you're laying down and you're 
looking up their glass coffin and it's 

1446
01:08:51,081 --> 01:08:51,914
raining jets.
What if you do that to a guy and it 

1447
01:08:53,861 --> 01:08:57,110
becomes uncontrolled?
Be Hard and just shoots in his pants?

1448
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:58,903
Well,
I think you're naked in the glass 

1449
01:08:59,451 --> 01:09:00,350
coffin.
Oh,

1450
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:01,423
okay.
I don't know if they like put you in 

1451
01:09:02,541 --> 01:09:05,120
funeral garb or whatever,
but my guess is like,

1452
01:09:05,150 --> 01:09:06,290
I mean it was me.
I'd be like,

1453
01:09:06,291 --> 01:09:07,040
you know,
I'm going to,

1454
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:07,873
I prefer to be naked.
You're going to fucking splattered all 

1455
01:09:10,611 --> 01:09:12,480
over this fucking thing.
I want you to be weirded out.

1456
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,370
Let's go for it,
man.

1457
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:20,120
I'm going to lay down face first.
You just stare at my area.

1458
01:09:20,121 --> 01:09:22,430
I'll try to come on the coffin from 
inside.

1459
01:09:22,870 --> 01:09:27,260
Come on it from the APP while singing 
Abba songs.

1460
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:30,020
But,
but do you ever like,

1461
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:35,350
I love thinking about this stuff because
I do think that there is probably,

1462
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:40,520
and this is kind of what we talking 
about a little bit before where the maps

1463
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:41,383
don't work anymore.
I think a lot of people like to live in 

1464
01:09:44,691 --> 01:09:47,720
a place where there's maps and they 
imagine that's all there is,

1465
01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:49,003
but I'm pretty sure that there are 
sectors of society that you just never 

1466
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:59,240
see and you never will see because they 
have around them.

1467
01:09:59,241 --> 01:10:00,074
This impermeable wall of wealth,
like you're not going to get in there 

1468
01:10:03,471 --> 01:10:08,471
like places that have membership fees 
that are like $600,000

1469
01:10:09,201 --> 01:10:10,970
a year.
Like yeah,

1470
01:10:10,971 --> 01:10:13,670
I know a guy lives in one of those uh,
gated communities.

1471
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:17,750
It has a golf course and the golf course
costs a quarter million dollars a year.

1472
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:21,410
That because that creates this wall 
where most people Gannett get into.

1473
01:10:21,411 --> 01:10:25,040
And then also that's crazy.
People are living in compounds.

1474
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:30,080
People are living in massive compounds 
that have entire teams of servants.

1475
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:31,340
Like,
dude,

1476
01:10:31,341 --> 01:10:35,030
there's people who have eight nannies 
for their baby.

1477
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:36,770
Did you know that?
There's people who have,

1478
01:10:36,771 --> 01:10:39,470
it's because they're poor and they can't
afford 15 like a normal family.

1479
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:41,513
Teenagers.
You got all the different languages 

1480
01:10:43,191 --> 01:10:44,024
covered,
the different styles you could have 

1481
01:10:45,171 --> 01:10:47,660
gained any straight.
Danny sees the kid likes.

1482
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:48,523
But that's when you think about that,
that there they're these enclaves of 

1483
01:10:51,741 --> 01:10:56,741
wealth that are compounds surrounded by 
not just like financial walls,

1484
01:10:56,931 --> 01:11:01,310
but literal walls with armed guards 
standing around the walls.

1485
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:04,390
And inside these compounds are 
communities of,

1486
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:05,463
of a servant class there communities of 
servants that are having to serve these 

1487
01:11:10,341 --> 01:11:12,440
wealth,
hyper wealthy people.

1488
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:13,483
That's a king and a queen.
It's a futile compound that's being 

1489
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:17,813
separated from the rest of the world.
And we're at least to duke and the 

1490
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,850
Duchess of Duke and the Duchess.
But I mean the pr,

1491
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:25,980
it's basically the no different.
It's,

1492
01:11:26,230 --> 01:11:27,063
it's the same fucking thing because a 
lot of the people working in there are 

1493
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:31,163
illegals,
so they don't even have recourse to 

1494
01:11:32,911 --> 01:11:33,744
normal laws and stuff like that.
And so what ends up happening in these 

1495
01:11:36,361 --> 01:11:40,530
compounds is there's people who are 
untraceable who live in there.

1496
01:11:40,531 --> 01:11:43,770
And that is when you end up in a fucking
space suit,

1497
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:47,380
sitting in a Goddamn Tesla going and 
fucking Mars,

1498
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:48,663
it easily,
you could put a disgrace nanny and that 

1499
01:11:52,501 --> 01:11:54,450
fucking thing.
You know when they're really gangster,

1500
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:57,450
when they have white nannies,
right?

1501
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,630
Pretty white nanny.
Pretty white nanny.

1502
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:04,500
The wife has to sit around like there's 
someone who's always at CEC.

1503
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:06,050
Always a check.
Yeah.

1504
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:07,470
Husband,
not quite checkmate.

1505
01:12:07,810 --> 01:12:09,750
Always a check.
Keep moving it around.

1506
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:10,740
Check.
Oh,

1507
01:12:10,741 --> 01:12:13,170
she conveniently dropped her keys in 
front of Luther.

1508
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:13,771
Yeah.
Look at her.

1509
01:12:13,771 --> 01:12:16,560
Pick them up the dirty bitch.
God fucking crazy.

1510
01:12:16,561 --> 01:12:18,300
I up in there.
I want you to picks up the keys.

1511
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:21,000
Monogamy is so dumb.
I believe I left these keys here.

1512
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:21,893
What Luther fucking nanny?
What just left the nanny likes another 

1513
01:12:24,801 --> 01:12:26,610
cause.
Then they might kill the wife.

1514
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:30,150
The wife knows too much.
Let the wife join so she knows about the

1515
01:12:30,151 --> 01:12:32,580
offshore accounts.
What you have to offer.

1516
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,740
She knows about the taxes.
Dude.

1517
01:12:34,741 --> 01:12:37,190
She knows more than that.
She knows more than that because,

1518
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:41,760
because what ends up happening in these 
compounds is you do start knowing things

1519
01:12:41,761 --> 01:12:45,360
and you start knowing real thing.
Yeah.

1520
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:46,194
You start getting the real downloads 
about like what's actually happening 

1521
01:12:48,721 --> 01:12:51,530
because these little fucking compounds,
they're all,

1522
01:12:51,531 --> 01:12:54,360
all those people are connected to each 
other and each other.

1523
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:55,193
Christmas cards and they go to each 
other's parties and stuff and like they 

1524
01:12:59,011 --> 01:13:02,000
talk and they have and they know stuff.
Man.

1525
01:13:02,001 --> 01:13:04,140
The way luther looked at the nanny on 
bro,

1526
01:13:04,830 --> 01:13:06,210
come on Bro.
She dropped her keys.

1527
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:08,040
You really think she dropped her keys?
Did you see that?

1528
01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:09,150
I did see it.
I heard,

1529
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,180
I heard.
Yeah,

1530
01:13:11,190 --> 01:13:12,023
I was there.
She dropped the keys on purpose and she 

1531
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:15,930
stuck her house right up in the air.
He's getting a divorce.

1532
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:18,930
We gotta be careful here folks.
You've got to keep this family together.

1533
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:23,990
Well these people sign like,
he's like huge nondisclosure agreements.

1534
01:13:24,651 --> 01:13:25,484
So like there,
there's like they're wrapped up in a 

1535
01:13:27,331 --> 01:13:28,164
veil of secrecy anyway,
but that's not what you have to worry 

1536
01:13:29,821 --> 01:13:30,870
about.
Where you have to worry about.

1537
01:13:30,871 --> 01:13:31,704
It's Harvey Keitel from pulp fiction.
That's you have to worry about to worry 

1538
01:13:35,341 --> 01:13:36,174
about someone making a phone call and 
some guy who works at some fucking ray 

1539
01:13:39,361 --> 01:13:43,680
Donovan in real life guy who works for 
rich people who can make a lot of money.

1540
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:49,040
Imagine if you're friends with a 
billionaire and this billionaire is a,

1541
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,120
he's in a situation.
Yeah,

1542
01:13:51,121 --> 01:13:52,630
no,
this is fucking guys.

1543
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:53,850
Just,
you know,

1544
01:13:53,851 --> 01:13:57,030
he's got pictures of my wife and yeah.
You know,

1545
01:13:57,031 --> 01:13:57,751
he's trying,
he's trying to,

1546
01:13:57,751 --> 01:13:59,490
he's trying to get some money out of me,
man.

1547
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,230
I don't know what to do.
Well,

1548
01:14:01,231 --> 01:14:05,340
so we can make this disappear for a tidy
sum of $200,000

1549
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:06,780
Dun,
Dun,

1550
01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:08,003
Dun,
and then all of a sudden that guy just 

1551
01:14:09,421 --> 01:14:11,070
isn't around anymore.
Yeah.

1552
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,130
The guy just gets picked

1553
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:12,963
off and you ever like would investigate 
it gets paid off and then it's like 

1554
01:14:15,881 --> 01:14:16,714
nothing happens that's just disappears.
Just take him into the middle of the 

1555
01:14:19,331 --> 01:14:20,050
ocean.
Well,

1556
01:14:20,050 --> 01:14:20,883
it didn't,
wasn't there just this billionaire 

1557
01:14:21,821 --> 01:14:24,820
Canadian couple that got executed.
Executed in their house.

1558
01:14:24,850 --> 01:14:25,683
Yeah.
It's like shit like that and there's 

1559
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:30,040
some sketchy deal.
What would their connected to?

1560
01:14:30,041 --> 01:14:30,874
It was the Clinton Foundation.
Was it Jesus fucking Christ Jesus 

1561
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:34,900
fucking Christ.
Oh,

1562
01:14:34,901 --> 01:14:38,080
Joe with you and your conspiracy 
theorists about the claim.

1563
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:40,630
Yes.
It's all coincidence after coincidence,

1564
01:14:40,631 --> 01:14:42,530
after coincidence and,
oh,

1565
01:14:42,570 --> 01:14:45,070
did you bring up seth rich again?
Let it go.

1566
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:46,630
Let it go.
No.

1567
01:14:46,631 --> 01:14:49,930
Suspects shot in the back in front of 
his house.

1568
01:14:49,931 --> 01:14:53,140
Four in the morning.
No robbery while it remains,

1569
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,033
phone remains watch remains private 
investigator and he's the guy who gave 

1570
01:14:57,491 --> 01:15:02,230
up all the DNC leaked emails.
He gave them up to wikileaks.

1571
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:04,480
Nope.
Just coincidence.

1572
01:15:04,510 --> 01:15:05,280
Yeah.
Muslim,

1573
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:06,113
nothing.
He gave up the linked emails that show 

1574
01:15:08,171 --> 01:15:09,004
that the Clinton campaign absolutely 
worked their fucking black magic to get 

1575
01:15:15,881 --> 01:15:17,430
Bernie sanders knocked out.
Oh God.

1576
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:18,431
Stop.
Stop.

1577
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:20,650
Stop Dude.
How about haunting man,

1578
01:15:21,290 --> 01:15:22,123
but at that video again,
put up that picture ends and he's 

1579
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:28,330
showing me murdered Canadian billionaire
couple barry and honey sherman.

1580
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:31,180
Several people murdered them.
It says several.

1581
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:32,380
Wow.
Wow.

1582
01:15:32,710 --> 01:15:33,880
Crazy.
That's crazy.

1583
01:15:33,881 --> 01:15:35,140
They got whacked.
Hey,

1584
01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:36,790
they fucked up.
It fucked up.

1585
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:37,933
What did they do?
Didn't have a big enough army around 

1586
01:15:39,191 --> 01:15:40,080
them.
They didn't have the army.

1587
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:42,880
Look at Duke and Duchess and you're 
going to hang out with assassins.

1588
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:44,650
Tried to save money on security.
You know,

1589
01:15:44,651 --> 01:15:47,800
if I was running a security team,
I'd show them.

1590
01:15:47,801 --> 01:15:50,020
I'd be like,
take a look at these guys.

1591
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:52,570
They tried to save money on their 
security team.

1592
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:53,433
Yeah,
right.

1593
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:54,363
Okay.
It says real to discover their bodies 

1594
01:15:56,351 --> 01:15:59,020
dangling from a railing near their 
basement swimming pool.

1595
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:01,030
I like that it says suspicious like,
oh yeah,

1596
01:16:01,031 --> 01:16:01,864
this seems a little suspicious.
These billionaires are just hanging 

1597
01:16:03,761 --> 01:16:04,594
here.
It looks like they were a strangled and 

1598
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:10,780
they died from a form of strangulation 
called ligature neck compression.

1599
01:16:10,781 --> 01:16:13,500
That means someone wrapped a rope around
their neck and choke them.

1600
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:17,640
Gorat that is,
that is a personal way to kill someone.

1601
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:19,300
That's very personal.
Yeah.

1602
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:22,600
That's intense shit man.
And these are old people,

1603
01:16:22,601 --> 01:16:24,910
70 75 years old.
If you google that,

1604
01:16:24,911 --> 01:16:26,890
it is not pretty pictures that you get 
back.

1605
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:31,870
I don't want people's faces that can 
print it out that Oh yeah man,

1606
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:34,090
you don't want that.
Don't want that to happen to you.

1607
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:34,983
See this is the,
this is why I think it would be scary 

1608
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:39,580
like to be friends with a billionaire.

1609
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:43,480
It's like it would be scary to be 
friends with someone way up at the upper

1610
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:47,980
ups because like you almost don't want 
that level of access.

1611
01:16:47,981 --> 01:16:49,630
Like it's almost like,
look man,

1612
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:53,020
you guys fucking do whatever you're 
doing up in your compounds.

1613
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:57,500
Drink from the iron skull.
Come on the fucking coffins.

1614
01:16:57,730 --> 01:17:00,250
Open the portals,
pull out the squids.

1615
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:03,760
I'm enjoying my life down here.
I really don't want to know.

1616
01:17:03,761 --> 01:17:08,140
Like I,
I would prefer to like to just speculate

1617
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:10,310
because here's the thing man.
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

1618
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,440
Please go ahead.
It,

1619
01:17:11,441 --> 01:17:13,340
there's levels to everything,
right?

1620
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:14,203
There's,
there's levels to the weirdness that's 

1621
01:17:15,201 --> 01:17:19,400
involved in immigrant communities that 
all keep the same language.

1622
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:21,050
They all stay together.
They huddle up together,

1623
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:21,943
their signs and their same language and 
then it becomes like a Korea town or a 

1624
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:25,110
chinatown.
The,

1625
01:17:25,110 --> 01:17:26,660
I'll just huddle in that area and stay 
in that area.

1626
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:29,360
There's weirdness to that.
This weirdness to billionaires doing,

1627
01:17:29,361 --> 01:17:30,860
getting together.
We're all just going to do a billionaire

1628
01:17:30,861 --> 01:17:31,970
shit together.
Yeah.

1629
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:32,893
We're all going to hang out together.
Any special clubs and those leather 

1630
01:17:34,851 --> 01:17:36,890
chairs,
those with the buttons on them,

1631
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:37,753
you know,
it's leather chairs.

1632
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:38,713
They're like smushy.
They have like puffy and then the 

1633
01:17:39,981 --> 01:17:41,840
buttons and then little buttons all over
him.

1634
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:45,350
It's a high back leather chair.
Sit there and perhaps there's a little a

1635
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,390
nightstand right next to you with the 
cigar.

1636
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:48,224
Ash tray tap that will serve our ass and
showed down and they bring over Cognac 

1637
01:17:52,341 --> 01:17:53,174
and you sift cognac like a gentleman and
you talk about where you're hiding your 

1638
01:17:55,821 --> 01:17:57,850
money.
You talk about a w,

1639
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:00,230
you know how you got rid of the syphilis
before the wife found out?

1640
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:01,460
You talk about,
uh,

1641
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:02,510
how you're,
uh,

1642
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:03,453
you're helping to trump get into 
position to make sure that you could 

1643
01:18:06,531 --> 01:18:08,640
drill in Africa wherever the fuck you 
going to do it.

1644
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:10,400
This,
this is what they do.

1645
01:18:10,430 --> 01:18:12,050
They get together.
How the fuck?

1646
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,090
Who else is gonna know what they're 
talking about,

1647
01:18:14,590 --> 01:18:15,620
right?
And it's,

1648
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:19,780
and it's fucking generational.
And some of them start going crazy.

1649
01:18:19,781 --> 01:18:21,730
Like that cop,
that cop boy,

1650
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:22,823
oh boy.
Do you know the cop boys making those 

1651
01:18:24,281 --> 01:18:26,020
dumb shirts?
If you seen that fucking,

1652
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:27,610
have you seen this shit?
No.

1653
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:30,010
Oh Dude,
you gotta see this?

1654
01:18:30,011 --> 01:18:30,820
This is like,

1655
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:31,900

is k o.

1656
01:18:31,901 --> 01:18:32,734
C.
H.

1657
01:18:32,830 --> 01:18:36,310
This is the progeny.
This is like the demonic antichrist.

1658
01:18:36,311 --> 01:18:37,480
Progeny of like,
oh,

1659
01:18:37,481 --> 01:18:38,680
the Koch brothers.
The Koch.

1660
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:41,170
Oh yeah.
Cause it's coke not cock the god of Toy.

1661
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:45,850
Yeah,
they're fucking cowboy.

1662
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:47,620
Dude,
this is like,

1663
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:48,633
this is the,
and this is what the antichrist looks 

1664
01:18:49,871 --> 01:18:51,670
like.
Everybody thinks the antichrist is going

1665
01:18:51,671 --> 01:18:56,671
to be smart and in like in like 
nefarious and focus like Demian.

1666
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:59,860
No Dude,
he's gonna like make fashion shirts.

1667
01:18:59,861 --> 01:19:01,210
Like look at this shit.

1668
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,233
Let me see what we got here.
Billionaire Air Wyatt coke makes shirts 

1669
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:09,420
about money.
I drank blood this morning.

1670
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,120
Wait a minute.
It's the shirts are about money.

1671
01:19:12,121 --> 01:19:13,530
Can you,
can I see those pictures again?

1672
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:16,230
That looks like pink handcuffs with 
keys.

1673
01:19:16,410 --> 01:19:18,690
How's that about money?
Because that's what I paid for.

1674
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:19,973
Paid be handcuffed.

1675
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:20,883
Are you,
are you allowed to show these videos of 

1676
01:19:22,121 --> 01:19:22,954
him?
Like dancing around and his shirts and 

1677
01:19:24,161 --> 01:19:24,930
shit.

1678
01:19:24,930 --> 01:19:26,920
It's actually been removed.
It's unavailable.

1679
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:27,840
Somebody got it

1680
01:19:28,010 --> 01:19:28,843
dude.
It's the weirdest fucking shit 

1681
01:19:30,441 --> 01:19:31,130
everywhere.

1682
01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:36,130
He brings his whimsical ideas to life 
with his retina blasting shirt.

1683
01:19:36,710 --> 01:19:41,710
Bray Wyatt Ingram.
So why at Ingram is his shirt brand?

1684
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:43,900
Yeah,
but you got to look up an interview with

1685
01:19:43,901 --> 01:19:48,190
him cause he says shit like daddy told 
me I could do whatever I want and I am.

1686
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:51,530
Look at this chick ooze that his girl 
picked up bigger.

1687
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:56,620
God Damn,
I prove I'm on his side.

1688
01:19:57,380 --> 01:20:00,560
If a guy who looks like that can get a 
girl looks like that,

1689
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:01,910
you go,
boy,

1690
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:04,220
what am I a man hater?
Huh?

1691
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:07,530
Am I one of these asshole men?
Shoot other men down.

1692
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:08,393
I'm not their guy.
He didn't even bother even think once 

1693
01:20:11,551 --> 01:20:14,100
about losing weight.
I'm not either.

1694
01:20:14,101 --> 01:20:16,200
I'm just using weight.
Look at my Zeros.

1695
01:20:16,230 --> 01:20:19,470
I'm just using that as an example of the
progeny of billionaires.

1696
01:20:19,471 --> 01:20:20,304
Like these people are like,
this is like something that this shit's 

1697
01:20:22,641 --> 01:20:25,620
spilling out of the mansions man.
Like look at this says here,

1698
01:20:25,621 --> 01:20:29,040
blessed this oafish coke air and his 
hideous shirts.

1699
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:32,520
He's a flamboyant guy and now we're 
talking about them.

1700
01:20:32,521 --> 01:20:34,510
Good for you sir.
I'm sorry coach.

1701
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,730
He's smart.
He's,

1702
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:40,760
he looks like the guy who sold the 
dinosaurs in Jurassic Park.

1703
01:20:40,891 --> 01:20:42,270
Remember the dude,
what's his name?

1704
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:43,193
The guy from Newman Newman.
He looks like Newman and he's banging a 

1705
01:20:46,381 --> 01:20:48,490
10 I mean you get the fuck out of here.
Also,

1706
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:49,343
it looks like he's been spending a lot 
of time in the skull and bones come 

1707
01:20:51,301 --> 01:20:52,134
coffin.

1708
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:59,490
Aye.
I,

1709
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:07,320
I'm not satisfied.
I haven't absorbed all the energy of who

1710
01:21:07,321 --> 01:21:12,321
come into my being.
Who knows,

1711
01:21:13,231 --> 01:21:13,891
man.
It's just,

1712
01:21:13,891 --> 01:21:16,440
it's just weird over there and on the,
I look at him,

1713
01:21:16,441 --> 01:21:17,274
I hope he has a giant Dick.
I think that's the Dick and the left 

1714
01:21:19,231 --> 01:21:21,450
pant to the left pant where the yellow 
is like,

1715
01:21:21,451 --> 01:21:23,360
it's kind of bulges out where the yell.
Yeah,

1716
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:25,350
that's his cock.
Giant fat.

1717
01:21:25,351 --> 01:21:27,120
Like a quaker oats box.
Scary.

1718
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:30,930
Scary.
That's him coming and it's like,

1719
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,150
it's like one of these water bottles.
That's what it's like.

1720
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:36,870
It's fat like that terrifying and the 
end of it,

1721
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:41,930
it quivers terrible seats like the demo 
gorgons mouth on stranger things.

1722
01:21:42,590 --> 01:21:44,340
The end of it,
it doesn't have a slot.

1723
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:47,310
It has like a little flower thing.
That's the very end.

1724
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:48,203
Every time we do an episode together,
we end up describing some form of alien 

1725
01:21:51,901 --> 01:21:54,030
caulk every single time.

1726
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:54,863
Like I know,
I know the last one we added a 

1727
01:21:56,081 --> 01:21:57,540
description of it.
Yeah.

1728
01:21:57,541 --> 01:21:59,130
That's scary.
Very immature.

1729
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:02,580
How dare you?
I think it's important to like speculate

1730
01:22:02,581 --> 01:22:05,010
on the different types of potential.
Alien Cox.

1731
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:06,423
I think Cox go away.
I think cox or this is a temporary 

1732
01:22:08,911 --> 01:22:10,650
situation.
100% really?

1733
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:11,431
Yup.
Yeah.

1734
01:22:11,431 --> 01:22:13,800
I think that's what aliens are.
That's when you see the aliens.

1735
01:22:13,801 --> 01:22:15,960
They have no Cox,
no Cox,

1736
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,033
no miles.
We're going to get rid of this mouth 

1737
01:22:18,001 --> 01:22:18,834
communication.
Going to get rid of this a cock and 

1738
01:22:20,731 --> 01:22:21,510
pussy.
Fucking,

1739
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:22,251
it's horrible.
No,

1740
01:22:22,251 --> 01:22:22,501
no,
no.

1741
01:22:22,501 --> 01:22:24,810
We're going to mind meld.
It's going to be like dmt every time.

1742
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,550
You're not even going to want to have 
regular sex.

1743
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:27,413
If you could,
if I could give you the gift of being 

1744
01:22:28,831 --> 01:22:31,290
able to travel through space wherever 
you wanted to go,

1745
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:34,740
but you had a nub down there.
You're Cox gone.

1746
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:35,663
No,
I'd be like Doctor Manhattan just 

1747
01:22:36,181 --> 01:22:37,860
sitting on Mars by myself.
I'll board.

1748
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:39,450
Fuck that.
Fuck that.

1749
01:22:39,451 --> 01:22:41,100
I like it here.
He'd rather hump.

1750
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:43,800
I like America.
I like being right here.

1751
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:44,790
Yes,
Angeles.

1752
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:46,350
Goddammit.
I like it.

1753
01:22:46,590 --> 01:22:47,423
But you wouldn't want to see like float 
at the edge of the tiny little dick 

1754
01:22:49,421 --> 01:22:54,421
crying as I slide through infinity like 
this.

1755
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:59,160
Look it down and up.
I have like a Dick,

1756
01:22:59,161 --> 01:22:59,994
like memorable.
They shrank Dr Ken's Dick and the the 

1757
01:23:02,521 --> 01:23:04,500
hangover.
They've made it like so small.

1758
01:23:04,501 --> 01:23:06,070
You couldn't even it.
Remember that

1759
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:09,130
would be what it was like.
I know,

1760
01:23:09,131 --> 01:23:10,510
man.
If he's so sad.

1761
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,480
Yeah,
and you'd live forever with no debt.

1762
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:17,050
No flying through space.
Just a nub buck board.

1763
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:19,030
Listen man,
I'm not into deals.

1764
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:21,940
I like what's going on right now.
I don't want to hear you.

1765
01:23:21,941 --> 01:23:24,670
Heaven deal.
I don't want to hear your space deal.

1766
01:23:24,730 --> 01:23:25,390
Yeah.
Good.

1767
01:23:25,390 --> 01:23:26,320
I'm good right here.

1768
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:27,031
Well,
I mean,

1769
01:23:27,031 --> 01:23:28,280
don't you ever,
I mean this are,

1770
01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:30,510
and this is another thing we taught.
We've done these so many times.

1771
01:23:30,690 --> 01:23:32,400
We're going to repeat of course,
but like dude,

1772
01:23:32,401 --> 01:23:33,234
one of the,
I do worry about you sometimes for him 

1773
01:23:34,261 --> 01:23:36,600
because it's like,
I think you're going to get,

1774
01:23:37,050 --> 01:23:37,883
I think it's finally going to happen.
I think one of your fucking guests is 

1775
01:23:40,201 --> 01:23:45,040
going to come in here with a briefcase 
and he's going to show you something and

1776
01:23:45,050 --> 01:23:45,770
I don't know,

1777
01:23:45,770 --> 01:23:48,640
like an alien piece of where the 
spacecraft was going to be.

1778
01:23:48,641 --> 01:23:50,530
Tom Delonge.
I was hoping he had something.

1779
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:51,710
No,
I think you're going to,

1780
01:23:51,711 --> 01:23:52,544
you're,
you're accidentally going to get access 

1781
01:23:54,591 --> 01:23:55,424
for some reason.
I think somebody is going to give you 

1782
01:23:56,691 --> 01:23:59,740
something or show you something and 
you're in like I,

1783
01:23:59,770 --> 01:24:01,710
I worry about you man.
Cause it's like,

1784
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:02,593
yeah cause you've got like you now have 
a platform that is unlike any platform 

1785
01:24:10,041 --> 01:24:11,210
that's happened.
You know,

1786
01:24:11,211 --> 01:24:13,430
because you're doing like a comedy 
podcast,

1787
01:24:13,431 --> 01:24:14,264
radio show style thing,
but you're also interviewing people 

1788
01:24:17,211 --> 01:24:18,044
about really heavy duty Shit and sure.
You like pepper it up with freaks like 

1789
01:24:22,041 --> 01:24:23,930
me from time to time.
Just for it up.

1790
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:25,220
Yeah.
But like you have,

1791
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:26,413
you make it sound like the,
the other people or the on the main 

1792
01:24:28,681 --> 01:24:31,260
agenda and mum patches pepper and up a 
little Duncan trussell.

1793
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:32,123
Well No,
I'm just saying like what the fuck do I 

1794
01:24:33,121 --> 01:24:34,710
know?
Like you're having people on you talking

1795
01:24:34,711 --> 01:24:37,980
about you and I have had my all time 
favorite podcasts.

1796
01:24:37,981 --> 01:24:38,814
Thanks.
I haven't my all time favorite group of 

1797
01:24:40,561 --> 01:24:41,394
people.
If I had like a handful of 10 people to 

1798
01:24:42,511 --> 01:24:44,670
pick forever,
just do podcasts them forever.

1799
01:24:44,671 --> 01:24:46,380
Yeah.
You are 100% on that.

1800
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:49,200
I appreciate that.
It's you and D as an Ra.

1801
01:24:49,201 --> 01:24:50,034
There's a few other people callen but 
there's just a list of people that are 

1802
01:24:52,621 --> 01:24:54,540
just forever.
Yeah Man,

1803
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:56,760
I love doing podcasts.
You don't you ever say that?

1804
01:24:57,910 --> 01:25:01,920
If it's between you and some fucking 
scientists want to prove to me that,

1805
01:25:01,921 --> 01:25:03,330
uh,
telekinesis is real.

1806
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:05,190
Go with you.
Please take the scientist,

1807
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:06,210
then we'll do it your

1808
01:25:06,210 --> 01:25:07,560
podcast after.
But Dude,

1809
01:25:07,561 --> 01:25:10,020
I'm telling you,
don't like knowing all this shit.

1810
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:11,453
And there's so many times when we've 
done this podcast where you and I have 

1811
01:25:14,541 --> 01:25:15,374
started talking and the elite,
the hair stands up on my arm and I'm 

1812
01:25:18,391 --> 01:25:18,960
like,
dude,

1813
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:19,793
like we,
we shouldn't be talking about some of 

1814
01:25:21,601 --> 01:25:23,130
this shit.
Like a,

1815
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,770
like a,
like it gives me the real Heebie jeebies

1816
01:25:25,771 --> 01:25:27,630
and then sometimes I'll admit this to 
you,

1817
01:25:27,631 --> 01:25:28,464
sometimes when I'm super stoned,
I'm thinking about all the podcasts 

1818
01:25:31,141 --> 01:25:33,090
we've done.
Sometimes I think to myself,

1819
01:25:33,570 --> 01:25:34,403
fuck ap Joe does know something like 
maybe you did end up getting some kind 

1820
01:25:42,211 --> 01:25:44,000
of little like shoulder,
uh,

1821
01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:46,590
with them where they're like,
not literally your shoulder up,

1822
01:25:46,591 --> 01:25:48,000
you just brushed shoulders.
And they were like,

1823
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:50,430
Hey,
we love your show.

1824
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:51,840
We love your show,
man.

1825
01:25:51,841 --> 01:25:52,674
They didn't even say anything.
They just showed themselves to you a 

1826
01:25:54,211 --> 01:25:55,710
little bit to be like,
hey look,

1827
01:25:56,130 --> 01:25:58,770
don't fuck around man.
Don't fuck around.

1828
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,780
Like you could talk.
We don't want,

1829
01:26:00,781 --> 01:26:02,760
we are funny.
We liked the way you talk,

1830
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,070
but don't fuck around

1831
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:05,420
man.
Don't you ever think that?

1832
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:06,680
Hmm.
No,

1833
01:26:06,681 --> 01:26:07,514
because I'm not like you got dammit.
Plus I don't keep those Cami ideas 

1834
01:26:10,071 --> 01:26:13,370
floating around inside my head.
I got a Goddamn American flag behind me.

1835
01:26:13,371 --> 01:26:15,530
Gun Control.
The fuck you're talking about.

1836
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:16,513
I'm friends with a ton of cops.
You got an American flag with a fucking 

1837
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:20,713
cow's skull above it.
It's actually an Asian buffalo from 

1838
01:26:24,111 --> 01:26:24,944
Australia.
There was arrowed by my great friend 

1839
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:27,370
Adam Green Tree.
Wow.

1840
01:26:28,370 --> 01:26:30,800
One of the best bow hunters on the face 
of the planet earth.

1841
01:26:30,830 --> 01:26:32,450
Wow.
He shot that thing.

1842
01:26:32,810 --> 01:26:33,643
Yeah,
but I mean it's like brought it to me 

1843
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:37,040
remembering my friend,
remember when we did that show,

1844
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:41,620
I remember we did that at this but it 
was kind of we is it.

1845
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:46,430
As the show progressed we became 
increasingly sort of despondent and find

1846
01:26:46,431 --> 01:26:50,300
realizing cause we're both retired.
Tell him that we here,

1847
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:52,160
maybe we were going to find an alien.

1848
01:26:52,850 --> 01:26:53,683
Like both of us secretly thought.
It became very frustrating because you 

1849
01:26:56,681 --> 01:26:57,514
saw the same thing and everybody you saw
this delusional belief in a logical 

1850
01:27:01,101 --> 01:27:06,101
things that they would argue.
They would argue illogically the,

1851
01:27:06,231 --> 01:27:07,064
there weren't objective about the actual
evidence versus what they wanted to 

1852
01:27:10,010 --> 01:27:10,843
perceive the evidence to point to there.
We're all biased in which I've been 

1853
01:27:13,791 --> 01:27:15,650
biased before.
Everyone has been biased but it was just

1854
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:17,030
delusional.
Everything.

1855
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:17,893
Everyone was delusional.
Everyone from the first Ufo guy to the 

1856
01:27:20,691 --> 01:27:23,570
first chem trail got to the first big 
foot guy.

1857
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:27,980
They were all either liars or delusional
or they had errors in their thinking.

1858
01:27:28,190 --> 01:27:29,023
And then occasionally we would talk to a
guy like that one dude that we met that 

1859
01:27:31,551 --> 01:27:32,384
was in the trailer that told us about 
the balls that would fly through the 

1860
01:27:34,071 --> 01:27:34,904
air.
Yes.

1861
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:36,013
Well after that I heard a podcast with a
physicist who a guy was a lightening 

1862
01:27:41,211 --> 01:27:43,790
expert who was talking about ball 
lightning.

1863
01:27:44,690 --> 01:27:46,400
They don't know what causes it,
right?

1864
01:27:46,490 --> 01:27:47,323
They don't know why it exists even.
And this guy was that it was on radio 

1865
01:27:51,261 --> 01:27:52,094
lab and it was fairly recently,
and this guy was actually saying that 

1866
01:27:54,321 --> 01:27:56,350
lightning itself,
uh,

1867
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:59,360
doesn't make any sense.
Like it's not supposed to exist.

1868
01:27:59,361 --> 01:28:00,194
If you're measuring all of the energy in
the skype is something that we don't 

1869
01:28:02,511 --> 01:28:04,610
know about what the formation of 
lightening is,

1870
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:06,620
that it shouldn't even exist.
Shouldn't be possible.

1871
01:28:06,650 --> 01:28:07,483
Right.
But this ball lightning is not only 

1872
01:28:08,871 --> 01:28:11,060
possible.
It's been observed many,

1873
01:28:11,061 --> 01:28:14,450
many times and it's even happened inside
of an airplane.

1874
01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:19,010
What floated down the aisle inside of an
airplane and multiple people witnessed.

1875
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:22,550
People have seen ball lightning,
they've gotten video of bald lightning.

1876
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:23,563
And what it looks like.
Is that exactly what that guy was 

1877
01:28:25,041 --> 01:28:25,874
describing to us that this thing came 
through his house and then just 

1878
01:28:29,001 --> 01:28:29,600
disappeared?

1879
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:30,433
Yeah.
Remember he's talking about totally 

1880
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:34,130
remember and he did not seem like a liar
to me now.

1881
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:35,173
I think he saw ball lightning and I 
think that area knew that skin Walker 

1882
01:28:38,751 --> 01:28:41,420
ranch place in particular is for 
whatever,

1883
01:28:41,421 --> 01:28:45,950
whatever causes that phenomenon.
It happens more frequently in that area.

1884
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:46,813
It's very possible because there are a 
lot of people over there that saw some 

1885
01:28:48,651 --> 01:28:49,640
shit share,
man.

1886
01:28:49,641 --> 01:28:50,080
I mean,
but,

1887
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:53,210
but this,
that was disappointing,

1888
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:56,390
but that was the most revealing.
It was revealing in the guy.

1889
01:28:56,391 --> 01:28:57,990
That was a weird area.
Yeah,

1890
01:28:58,010 --> 01:28:59,690
it was weird.
There was a fucking weird area.

1891
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:01,560
But don't you like

1892
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:05,580
imagine that?
Do you ever do this game?

1893
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:06,503
There's a fun game or you start thinking
about who the smartest person on the 

1894
01:29:08,701 --> 01:29:09,534
planet must be.
Like the continuum of intelligence game 

1895
01:29:11,731 --> 01:29:12,990
where you start thinking like,
okay,

1896
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:15,570
I know I land somewhere on the continuum
of intelligence.

1897
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:16,913
I know there's people that are probably 
not quite as smart as I am and I know 

1898
01:29:19,591 --> 01:29:21,870
there's people who are way fucking 
smarter than I am.

1899
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,150
And then you start thinking of yourself,
who are the,

1900
01:29:24,151 --> 01:29:27,270
who are those people and what and what 
are they up to?

1901
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:29,010
And then you start thinking,
see,

1902
01:29:29,011 --> 01:29:30,420
this is what I think about.
If I were you.

1903
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,610
Then you start thinking like,
fuck man,

1904
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:36,870
I've got this podcast that lots of 
people listen to.

1905
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:38,273
Is it ever happened where maybe some 
really intelligent person has 

1906
01:29:41,671 --> 01:29:42,504
manipulated me and an attempt to get me 
to disseminate some kind of information 

1907
01:29:45,391 --> 01:29:46,440
out into the world.

1908
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:48,330
Good luck manipulating me.
Duncan Trussell,

1909
01:29:48,331 --> 01:29:51,990
I'm an American.
Flags don't run or something.

1910
01:29:52,050 --> 01:29:56,370
What happens is colors at least know 
what's up,

1911
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:58,110
bro.
But you wouldn't even know.

1912
01:29:58,111 --> 01:29:59,790
That's the thing you wouldn't even know.
I wouldn't know.

1913
01:29:59,791 --> 01:30:00,624
How would I not know?
These people are people we're not going 

1914
01:30:02,161 --> 01:30:02,994
to be like if they're,
if someone is super so good at 

1915
01:30:04,741 --> 01:30:08,370
manipulating people that can manipulate 
me and it changed the way or think about

1916
01:30:08,371 --> 01:30:09,204
them.
Yeah,

1917
01:30:09,690 --> 01:30:11,550
well then good luck.
Right?

1918
01:30:11,551 --> 01:30:12,384
I mean,
but that's like the thing is like this 

1919
01:30:13,561 --> 01:30:14,011
is,
again,

1920
01:30:14,011 --> 01:30:15,580
I'm not trying to make you paranoid or 
anything,

1921
01:30:15,581 --> 01:30:16,620
right?
It's just,

1922
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:19,710
but it's fun to think cause it's like 
this like,

1923
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:20,723
okay,
like let's imagine for the sake of just 

1924
01:30:23,161 --> 01:30:23,994
fun,
we established there these fucking 

1925
01:30:25,831 --> 01:30:28,440
billionaires and they live in these 
compounds and they,

1926
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:31,580
and we've also established that 
certainly people like mice thing,

1927
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:34,340
Michael Hastings and other people,
they get killed all the time.

1928
01:30:34,350 --> 01:30:35,183
Might have,
but I think you got killed because he 

1929
01:30:36,451 --> 01:30:39,650
got a fucking major general fired.
Well they what?

1930
01:30:39,710 --> 01:30:41,910
What did we establish their general 
during,

1931
01:30:41,980 --> 01:30:42,813
they're super powerful people who will 
use technology to kill people to have 

1932
01:30:45,691 --> 01:30:46,524
their own way.
So that means that there is some group 

1933
01:30:48,721 --> 01:30:49,554
or a series of groups of people that are
you doing or like highly nefarious 

1934
01:30:53,130 --> 01:30:56,460
actions from a place of power.
I'm just paranoid.

1935
01:30:56,670 --> 01:30:57,503
Or you're not connecting the dots here.
Maybe he was on speed and drove into a 

1936
01:30:59,521 --> 01:31:01,860
tree.
Then the honestly I do not know.

1937
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:03,330
But the,
his very fun.

1938
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:06,450
Yeah.
To think that it's a conspiracy and they

1939
01:31:06,451 --> 01:31:07,440
killed him.
Very Fun.

1940
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:11,820
But if you look at Ockham's razor,
you know if you applied ockham's razor,

1941
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:15,880
the most likely scenario is that he just
drove into a tree that's not very sexy.

1942
01:31:15,881 --> 01:31:16,714
Here is a way to kind of help out with 
Ockham's razor with these kinds of 

1943
01:31:21,301 --> 01:31:21,570
things.

1944
01:31:21,570 --> 01:31:22,890
It's just think,
okay,

1945
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:24,053
I have $100,000
and I'm going to put bets and this 

1946
01:31:27,151 --> 01:31:30,270
awesome casino where the truth is 
revealed.

1947
01:31:30,271 --> 01:31:34,890
So are you going to put the money down 
on him being assassinated?

1948
01:31:34,940 --> 01:31:35,773
Are you going to put the money down on 
him being on speed and driving into a 

1949
01:31:39,391 --> 01:31:41,370
tree after he said,
if I commit suicide,

1950
01:31:41,371 --> 01:31:43,440
it's not a suicide.
I got to meet the guy.

1951
01:31:43,740 --> 01:31:45,300
He might that might've been thrown 
people off.

1952
01:31:45,340 --> 01:31:46,173
Get to meet him.
Maybe he wanted to leave a fucking 

1953
01:31:47,371 --> 01:31:48,990
story.
Maybe this guy's like,

1954
01:31:48,991 --> 01:31:49,824
you know what?
I'm just going to have these people 

1955
01:31:50,311 --> 01:31:52,110
think.
Did I got fans,

1956
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:53,150
man?
Shit,

1957
01:31:56,150 --> 01:31:59,440
ah no,
no dude,

1958
01:31:59,870 --> 01:32:00,250
I

1959
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:02,740
know where you'd put your money.
I know where I put my money.

1960
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:04,133
If it was like 50 bucks.
Yeah I'm going to bet on conspiracy 

1961
01:32:05,771 --> 01:32:08,530
cause this is deciding if I lose 50 
bucks,

1962
01:32:09,010 --> 01:32:09,843
I won't feel that.
I feel like wow fuck hoes is hoping to 

1963
01:32:11,801 --> 01:32:12,760
win.
But you're like,

1964
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:13,833
I'm just saying man,
how do you deal with being on the 

1965
01:32:14,981 --> 01:32:17,950
fucking radar man?
Because like the thing is like if there,

1966
01:32:17,951 --> 01:32:21,490
if there is an interest in controlling 
the pair and the reality tunnel,

1967
01:32:21,491 --> 01:32:22,324
like we know that there is a Wa like 
truly a award to control the paradigm 

1968
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:32,860
because if I can control the paradigm 
just as a cool thing,

1969
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:34,150
this is,
I agree with you,

1970
01:32:34,151 --> 01:32:37,900
but I don't think it's a united front.
This war to control the paradigm is most

1971
01:32:38,110 --> 01:32:41,600
tightly fought between left and right.
It's most tightly fought in,

1972
01:32:41,601 --> 01:32:42,434
in government.

1973
01:32:42,630 --> 01:32:43,900
Right?
In the real things.

1974
01:32:44,230 --> 01:32:46,600
Well we're doing is commentating on the 
sidelines.

1975
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:47,410
Yeah.
You know,

1976
01:32:47,410 --> 01:32:48,243
if I'm an influencing anybody,
I'm influencing people by pointing them 

1977
01:32:51,041 --> 01:32:53,530
to information that I see that's already
out there.

1978
01:32:53,980 --> 01:32:58,980
There's a big difference between these 
people are in power against each other,

1979
01:32:59,230 --> 01:33:00,063
right?
There's gotta be some people that are 

1980
01:33:01,121 --> 01:33:04,660
influencers that get access or get shit 
upon,

1981
01:33:04,661 --> 01:33:07,060
especially in the age of trump,
like if you're an antitrust and me,

1982
01:33:07,061 --> 01:33:09,610
if he finds out you're against him.
He's got like,

1983
01:33:09,611 --> 01:33:12,400
he's very vindictive.
Like he calls don lemon a moron,

1984
01:33:12,410 --> 01:33:15,940
and he shits all over those CNN host and
call CNN fake news.

1985
01:33:15,941 --> 01:33:19,990
But Sean Hannity and Fox and friends,
he'll praise them in his tweets.

1986
01:33:19,991 --> 01:33:22,450
Like there's an information war going on
with these people,

1987
01:33:22,451 --> 01:33:27,130
but they're paying attention to right 
and left assholes like me that are like,

1988
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:27,620
what am I?

1989
01:33:27,620 --> 01:33:29,140
What am I?
I'm a fence sitter,

1990
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:30,190
you know?
I mean it fucking,

1991
01:33:30,191 --> 01:33:32,590
Ron Paul was running for president.
I'd probably be like,

1992
01:33:32,591 --> 01:33:34,450
I'm in,
let's see how this works.

1993
01:33:34,510 --> 01:33:35,650
Right?
I like what he's saying.

1994
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,130
I like his ideas.
He,

1995
01:33:37,131 --> 01:33:37,964
he was,
he was a guy that when he was running 

1996
01:33:39,281 --> 01:33:40,001
for president,
I was like,

1997
01:33:40,001 --> 01:33:40,870
okay,
well this is,

1998
01:33:40,871 --> 01:33:43,390
this guy's clearly a very honorable 
person.

1999
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:46,210
He's clearly a very honest person.
I mean,

2000
01:33:46,211 --> 01:33:48,400
by all accounts.
Let's see what he does,

2001
01:33:48,550 --> 01:33:50,020
what he does.
Let's see what he does,

2002
01:33:50,270 --> 01:33:51,430
what happens.
Let's see what that,

2003
01:33:51,431 --> 01:33:54,610
it's gotta be better than just knowing 
you're being bullshitted.

2004
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:55,863
So many of them are just so obviously 
bullshitting you that you're listening 

2005
01:33:58,901 --> 01:33:59,734
to.
These can fucking speeches and you're 

2006
01:34:00,881 --> 01:34:01,451
like,
God damn it.

2007
01:34:01,451 --> 01:34:02,970
I don't resonate with you at all.
Right?

2008
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:03,903
This is that presidential type of 
address where I talk in a way that 

2009
01:34:09,071 --> 01:34:11,880
you've never heard a normal person 
talking in your presence before.

2010
01:34:11,910 --> 01:34:13,390
You might say to yourself,
well,

2011
01:34:13,391 --> 01:34:16,860
that's weird man,
but I got to talk like that when there's

2012
01:34:16,870 --> 01:34:19,630
a lot of people now you don't.
You don't.

2013
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:21,500
That's not real.
And I don't understand.

2014
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:25,390
You put a shield up and the shield is a 
an act.

2015
01:34:25,530 --> 01:34:27,140
You have a presidential act.
Sure.

2016
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:30,320
Or you have a strip club Dj act,
right?

2017
01:34:30,321 --> 01:34:31,154
Well,
you have a morning Dj App ride five 

2018
01:34:32,921 --> 01:34:35,050
o'clock past the hour.
Here we go.

2019
01:34:35,051 --> 01:34:38,870
Led Zepplin houses of the holy,
the ocean,

2020
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:40,410
Dat,
Dat Dah.

2021
01:34:40,470 --> 01:34:43,000
Yeah,
I mean that's the fucking voice.

2022
01:34:43,001 --> 01:34:46,680
I've heard that voice a thousand times.
It's a goddamn costume that people were,

2023
01:34:46,700 --> 01:34:48,670
you also have a fuck voice.
Don't forget that.

2024
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:49,990
I don't have a fuck boy.
So you don't,

2025
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:50,501
oh,
come on,

2026
01:34:50,501 --> 01:34:55,501
let me put it in.
Talk like you wouldn't fucking crazy.

2027
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:02,220
Do you?
You,

2028
01:35:02,221 --> 01:35:04,260
um,
you don't have a fuck voice.

2029
01:35:04,290 --> 01:35:05,123
Come on.
Sorry.

2030
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:06,240
They won't hear my voice.
Yeah.

2031
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:18,520
It's time to fire.
You Do,

2032
01:35:18,610 --> 01:35:19,570
do,
do.

2033
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,610
There's so much shame and wanting to 
fuck.

2034
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:26,680
Ooh.
She wants to fuck itchy vagina or vagina

2035
01:35:28,391 --> 01:35:31,000
needs it to get scratched.
Yeah,

2036
01:35:31,001 --> 01:35:32,050
man.
It's one of the,

2037
01:35:32,051 --> 01:35:32,884
definitely one of the tragic parts of 
society is that people feel shame about 

2038
01:35:36,791 --> 01:35:40,240
that.
I love the scene in game of thrones when

2039
01:35:40,241 --> 01:35:41,240
Cece,
what's her name?

2040
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:44,490
[inaudible] the beautiful darcy.
Thank you.

2041
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,540
When service,
he's walking naked down the street.

2042
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:51,840
They're going shame the shame bell shame
and the shame bell APP on my phone.

2043
01:35:51,941 --> 01:35:53,770
I used to,
you can get the shame about lap.

2044
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:55,120
Whew.
Yeah.

2045
01:35:55,630 --> 01:35:57,970
I don't have any more.
Why is it too much?

2046
01:35:58,030 --> 01:36:00,780
Having too much power.
We're addicted to the shame factor.

2047
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:02,530
People delete their facebook off their 
phone.

2048
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:06,280
I know people that like regularly delete
their facebook.

2049
01:36:06,281 --> 01:36:07,860
They fucked us.
They just take it off their phone.

2050
01:36:07,860 --> 01:36:08,890
I can't do this anymore,
man.

2051
01:36:09,250 --> 01:36:11,740
Too much power with the shame bowel man,
but people,

2052
01:36:11,741 --> 01:36:14,920
there's a lot of dudes.
You ring that fucking shame ballot girls

2053
01:36:14,921 --> 01:36:16,190
all the fucking time,
man.

2054
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:17,530
It's the worst.
Yeah,

2055
01:36:17,531 --> 01:36:19,750
you're ruining the whole vibe.
Yeah.

2056
01:36:19,780 --> 01:36:20,613
Well you know what it is.
Cause guys feel terrible when a girl 

2057
01:36:22,061 --> 01:36:22,894
leaves them and fuck somebody else.
If they want to make it like very 

2058
01:36:25,001 --> 01:36:27,210
difficult to write new man.
Right?

2059
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:30,040
Sex more than one man.
You've dirty little bitch.

2060
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:32,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

2061
01:36:32,261 --> 01:36:34,660
Or if you're like not of your 
polyamorous,

2062
01:36:34,661 --> 01:36:35,494
then like the yoga,
they call you a cock because you don't 

2063
01:36:37,211 --> 01:36:38,044
care that other people are fucking hippy
talk for when you move to Cuba or 

2064
01:36:42,191 --> 01:36:44,090
wherever the fuck.
I don't think they listen

2065
01:36:45,350 --> 01:36:48,290
in America.
You get a fucking wife and that's it.

2066
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:51,620
Greedy Bitch is an even number of people
over here.

2067
01:36:51,621 --> 01:36:56,440
This ain't China son want to go live in 
China has this like fucking 10 guys,

2068
01:36:57,540 --> 01:36:58,373
10 guys

2069
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:00,370
guys,
everyone check.

2070
01:37:00,371 --> 01:37:01,900
You're going to wind up but fucking 
other dudes.

2071
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:03,370
Oh well fuck it.
Yeah.

2072
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:05,740
You say come coffins all day,
baby.

2073
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:08,470
That's what happens in prison.
People get crazy.

2074
01:37:08,471 --> 01:37:10,010
They start having sex with men.
You just gotta.

2075
01:37:10,030 --> 01:37:13,890
You gotta figure out a way out of prison
or having sex with men.

2076
01:37:14,290 --> 01:37:15,790
Figure out a wig.
Gotta get rid of your,

2077
01:37:15,791 --> 01:37:17,680
come comes,
got to figure out a way out.

2078
01:37:17,681 --> 01:37:20,890
What's the best way your hands are going
to have to fuck guys or something?

2079
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:22,240
Shit,
this is bullshit.

2080
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:23,173
That's,
that's what happens if you live in 

2081
01:37:23,831 --> 01:37:24,970
China.
That's what happens.

2082
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:28,630
If I don't have real,
real lesson here to learn,

2083
01:37:28,930 --> 01:37:32,200
but if there's more than 10 to one men 
to women,

2084
01:37:33,220 --> 01:37:36,490
well don't they have,
they have some crazy problem over there.

2085
01:37:36,491 --> 01:37:37,930
I'm not making this up.
They have a prick.

2086
01:37:38,110 --> 01:37:39,940
Joking folks.
Obviously I'm joking,

2087
01:37:40,150 --> 01:37:41,950
but there's a crazy problem over there 
with,

2088
01:37:41,951 --> 01:37:43,560
uh,
the ratio of men,

2089
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:45,610
women or is the ratio.
Let's take a guess.

2090
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:47,680
What is the ratio of men to women in 
China?

2091
01:37:47,681 --> 01:37:49,930
I meant like 60,
40.

2092
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:52,480
It might be bad news.
It might be higher.

2093
01:37:52,750 --> 01:37:54,100
That's danger.
Might've made that up.

2094
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:55,300
That's a dangerous,

2095
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:58,110
it's a spooky ratio.
I've read the ratio.

2096
01:37:58,111 --> 01:38:00,940
It's not a good ratio.
Spooky fucked up ratio.

2097
01:38:01,050 --> 01:38:01,381
Well,
you know,

2098
01:38:01,381 --> 01:38:03,930
for the long time they had limitations 
on how many children you can have,

2099
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:07,830
which is just fucking take gen x.
They messed up the whole thing.

2100
01:38:07,831 --> 01:38:08,664
It's not just that man,
people were killing their baby if they 

2101
01:38:11,041 --> 01:38:12,930
found their baby was a girl.
I mean,

2102
01:38:12,931 --> 01:38:15,390
this is a real thing.
It didn't happen everywhere.

2103
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:16,313
It didn't happen all the time,
but there absolutely were girls that 

2104
01:38:18,571 --> 01:38:19,404
were drowned because they were girls 
because the family wanted a boy and if 

2105
01:38:21,751 --> 01:38:24,690
you don't think that that's the case,
you're delusional.

2106
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:25,583
I think you're delusional.
I think if you put those kind of 

2107
01:38:26,851 --> 01:38:30,930
restrictions on intensely poor people,
in some of them,

2108
01:38:30,931 --> 01:38:34,320
in some parts of the country,
they're in terrible poverty and you tell

2109
01:38:34,321 --> 01:38:35,520
them they can only have one kid.

2110
01:38:35,730 --> 01:38:38,190
They don't want to have a boy because 
the boy is going to help them work.

2111
01:38:38,430 --> 01:38:39,263
Right.
I don't know if these stories of them 

2112
01:38:40,741 --> 01:38:43,230
drowning baby girls were true because I 
wasn't there.

2113
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:46,740
Those stories persist.
Sherry ever snope them,

2114
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:49,260
but I don't think they know either.
If you weren't there,

2115
01:38:49,261 --> 01:38:50,640
what happened?
Brutal.

2116
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:52,860
Fuck.
It's a horrible thing to think to have a

2117
01:38:52,861 --> 01:38:54,640
baby and then just drowning.
He's,

2118
01:38:54,700 --> 01:38:57,180
it doesn't have a deck,
but two people have done that.

2119
01:38:57,181 --> 01:38:58,860
People have left babies and garbage 
cans.

2120
01:38:58,861 --> 01:39:01,230
I mean people have done a lot of 
terrible things to babies.

2121
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:03,300
When I was a kid,
I,

2122
01:39:03,301 --> 01:39:04,134
um,
worked at a place called Newport 

2123
01:39:05,490 --> 01:39:06,323
creamery and it was right next to a bank
and a girl that worked in the bank was 

2124
01:39:09,541 --> 01:39:11,610
pregnant.
She never told anybody she was pregnant.

2125
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:15,000
She gave birth in the toilet and left 
the baby in the garbage.

2126
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,460
They found the baby in the fucking 
garbage dead.

2127
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:21,510
And she got arrested.
And this was a girl I used to go to.

2128
01:39:21,511 --> 01:39:23,190
I used to go,
she was a bank teller.

2129
01:39:23,310 --> 01:39:25,230
I would go to the teller.
She like,

2130
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:27,360
she was,
she seemed awkward,

2131
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:30,690
you know,
she was at Carnegie dates or anything.

2132
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:31,700
No,
I did not.

2133
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:33,630
She wasn't checking and she was a large 
woman,

2134
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:35,610
which is why nobody could tell that she 
was pregnant.

2135
01:39:35,660 --> 01:39:36,493
She was big and um,
she apparently had been pregnant and 

2136
01:39:39,901 --> 01:39:40,734
didn't tell anybody.
And nine months pregnant at work and 

2137
01:39:43,621 --> 01:39:44,454
just had the baby in the,
in the toilet and threw it in the 

2138
01:39:46,201 --> 01:39:47,034
trashcan.
And I don't know if she didn't take the 

2139
01:39:49,141 --> 01:39:51,090
trash out.
I don't know how she got busted.

2140
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:55,470
You imagine going into the bathroom and 
you're taking a shit and you're like,

2141
01:39:55,471 --> 01:39:56,304
why does it smell like baby in here?
Because that smell and then you look 

2142
01:39:59,491 --> 01:40:04,380
into the wastepaper basket.
You see an I gotcha.

2143
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:07,480
That is so fucked up.
So fucked up.

2144
01:40:07,481 --> 01:40:09,970
That was a real person that I knew.
The country with.

2145
01:40:09,971 --> 01:40:12,130
The highest gender disparity of birth 
isn't China.

2146
01:40:12,131 --> 01:40:13,510
What is it?
Lichtenstein.

2147
01:40:13,660 --> 01:40:15,520
Oh,
where's that terrible,

2148
01:40:16,090 --> 01:40:17,330
sad play.
Okay,

2149
01:40:17,740 --> 01:40:20,020
let's find out what the ratio of men to 
women.

2150
01:40:20,021 --> 01:40:23,860
It's the same about 33 million more men 
than women.

2151
01:40:23,890 --> 01:40:28,000
So it was like 733 million men and 688 
or something like that.

2152
01:40:28,030 --> 01:40:30,310
Okay,
so it's like nineties.

2153
01:40:30,370 --> 01:40:32,620
That's like in the nineties isn't it?
Says Christ.

2154
01:40:32,621 --> 01:40:34,060
Man,
that's crazy.

2155
01:40:34,090 --> 01:40:36,550
It's still a large number.
Thank God for sex robots.

2156
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:39,760
They're going to better though.
It's better than I thought it was.

2157
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:42,730
Um,
within 115 males.

2158
01:40:42,731 --> 01:40:43,930
Every one.
Go ahead brother.

2159
01:40:44,610 --> 01:40:48,580
115 males to every 100 females.
China isn't the country that most store.

2160
01:40:48,730 --> 01:40:50,380
That's crazy.
Imagine if you're in a room,

2161
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:54,070
there's 115 dudes in a hundred girls.
It's like a crazy chair thing.

2162
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:54,791
Like,
Shit,

2163
01:40:54,791 --> 01:40:56,270
I've got to find a cow.
That's one's worse.

2164
01:40:56,290 --> 01:40:58,930
Where and linkedin sign,
it's 126 males to every hundred,

2165
01:40:58,931 --> 01:41:00,640
but there's only,
there's less than 40,000

2166
01:41:00,641 --> 01:41:02,680
people in the whole country.
So it's even worse.

2167
01:41:02,710 --> 01:41:06,430
So the cause the cause there's less,
less possibility.

2168
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:08,410
Fuck man.
Magic.

2169
01:41:08,411 --> 01:41:10,240
There's a country that that's a crazy 
country.

2170
01:41:10,270 --> 01:41:11,710
37,000
people.

2171
01:41:11,770 --> 01:41:13,690
That's a crazy country.
That's that.

2172
01:41:13,691 --> 01:41:15,460
Countries like Burbank.
No,

2173
01:41:15,461 --> 01:41:17,170
it's not even burbank.
Yeah.

2174
01:41:17,230 --> 01:41:18,370
No.
It's like,

2175
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:20,470
what's 37th that,
let's take a guess.

2176
01:41:22,090 --> 01:41:25,750
A part of La has 37,000
people in this Christ.

2177
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:28,780
37,000.
That ain't,

2178
01:41:28,781 --> 01:41:32,860
that's nothing out here.
Like boulder is 100,000

2179
01:41:33,310 --> 01:41:34,143
in boulder seems so quaint.
That town is one third the size of 

2180
01:41:37,571 --> 01:41:38,404
boulder.
I mean that country has one third the 

2181
01:41:39,641 --> 01:41:42,340
size of boulder.
That's amazing.

2182
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:45,160
Wow.
When you think of it that way.

2183
01:41:45,580 --> 01:41:47,950
That's amazing.
As many people as in culver city,

2184
01:41:49,210 --> 01:41:52,960
I imagine if culver city,
he was a country.

2185
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:55,540
Whoa.
Beverly Hills is 34,000

2186
01:41:55,870 --> 01:41:57,430
that's amazing.
So it's beverly hills.

2187
01:41:57,790 --> 01:41:59,740
It's beverly hills as a country with all
dudes.

2188
01:41:59,770 --> 01:42:01,480
That's amazing.
With all dudes,

2189
01:42:01,630 --> 01:42:05,380
just like Beverly Hills,
that gay couple things satisfy.

2190
01:42:05,381 --> 01:42:06,214
Fuck.
Imagine people have a real hard time 

2191
01:42:09,940 --> 01:42:11,710
with the idea of gay people raising 
kids.

2192
01:42:11,740 --> 01:42:12,573
They get real angry.
I just can't think that all gay people 

2193
01:42:16,931 --> 01:42:17,764
are the same.
Why would you not think that some gay 

2194
01:42:20,441 --> 01:42:22,420
people would be good at all kinds of 
things?

2195
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:25,420
There's going to be gay people that are 
great carpenters.

2196
01:42:25,570 --> 01:42:27,120
There's going to be gay,
like gay people.

2197
01:42:27,130 --> 01:42:27,963
Just like straight people is going to be
awesome ones and it's getting me ones 

2198
01:42:30,761 --> 01:42:31,594
that are fucked up.
The idea that they wouldn't be good 

2199
01:42:33,941 --> 01:42:37,450
parents.
Wouldn't you rather have two gay parents

2200
01:42:37,451 --> 01:42:38,284
that loved you than a a mother that's a 
fucking crack head and a dad that's 

2201
01:42:41,681 --> 01:42:45,340
piece of shit beats you to gay people 
that let you be yourself.

2202
01:42:46,030 --> 01:42:47,020
You know,
just they're,

2203
01:42:47,050 --> 01:42:50,350
they're cool and conscientious.
They just happened to be homosexual.

2204
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:53,410
They love each other.
They hug in front of you.

2205
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,273
You realize like,
we're all wrapped up in this bullshit 

2206
01:42:56,231 --> 01:42:57,550
of,
you know,

2207
01:42:58,300 --> 01:42:59,800
men and women,
Chilean be together,

2208
01:43:00,100 --> 01:43:00,933
heterosexual people like ourselves.
We get weird when you think of someone 

2209
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:07,720
who's homosexual,
like I'm fully in support of it,

2210
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:08,853
but when,
if they started fucking right in front 

2211
01:43:09,761 --> 01:43:10,181
of you,
but like,

2212
01:43:10,181 --> 01:43:11,320
hey,
I got go.

2213
01:43:12,010 --> 01:43:15,460
Whereas like if Dunkin started banging 
his girlfriend right in front of me,

2214
01:43:15,461 --> 01:43:19,360
I'd be like,
do you want me to cheer you on?

2215
01:43:19,590 --> 01:43:21,880
How you want me to handle it?
Just watch.

2216
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:23,290
Okay.
Don't look at me when you come though.

2217
01:43:23,350 --> 01:43:25,870
That last time was weird.
I was just like,

2218
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:27,090
look over.
Oh,

2219
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:28,990
ah,
make eye contract.

2220
01:43:29,050 --> 01:43:31,020
They,
but it's like,

2221
01:43:31,290 --> 01:43:32,123
I,
uh,

2222
01:43:32,230 --> 01:43:36,430
I've seen guys kiss in public and a part
of me is happy for them.

2223
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:37,361
Pardon me?
He's like,

2224
01:43:37,361 --> 01:43:42,130
that's awesome that they're so 
comfortable in 2018 now 17 at the time,

2225
01:43:42,190 --> 01:43:44,500
maybe even 16.
I seen him a couple of times.

2226
01:43:44,810 --> 01:43:49,090
What had one time I was driving and uh,
I was going from the comedy store.

2227
01:43:49,270 --> 01:43:50,200
I took.
Right.

2228
01:43:50,350 --> 01:43:52,010
And then I went down.
Is it

2229
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:52,843
doe Heeney which treat is it?
One of the streets that goes right to 

2230
01:43:55,251 --> 01:43:58,640
Santa Monica Boulevard,
which is like full rage,

2231
01:43:58,641 --> 01:43:59,474
gay central.
It did just dude's in the streets party 

2232
01:44:02,540 --> 01:44:03,373
and there's this big gay club with guys 
on Poles and shit and this is two dudes 

2233
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:10,340
and they were hanging out and they uh,
there were belt Lupin.

2234
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:13,580
We're like,
they each had their hands on the other's

2235
01:44:13,581 --> 01:44:14,960
belt loops,
like,

2236
01:44:14,961 --> 01:44:19,190
like anchoring in and they were just 
grinding on each other and kissing.

2237
01:44:19,430 --> 01:44:21,350
And I was just,
I was in my car.

2238
01:44:21,351 --> 01:44:23,150
I was like,
oh Jesus,

2239
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:25,220
Jesus,
deep moving.

2240
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:27,860
Don't stop here.
I was like terrified.

2241
01:44:28,050 --> 01:44:28,883
I was like,
the car was stopped and they were right 

2242
01:44:29,961 --> 01:44:32,000
there.
Like belt looping and making out,

2243
01:44:32,190 --> 01:44:34,470
okay.
Simulator.

2244
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:39,570
You have access to any experience you 
want and you're in it for,

2245
01:44:39,660 --> 01:44:41,460
I don't know,
a hundred thousand years.

2246
01:44:41,461 --> 01:44:42,294
You're like some in a mortal being how 
long before you simulate fucking a dude 

2247
01:44:46,511 --> 01:44:47,161
joe?
Well,

2248
01:44:47,161 --> 01:44:48,660
you know what happened?
Marlon Brando.

2249
01:44:48,870 --> 01:44:49,703
Yeah,
he fucked prior eve also fucked Marvin 

2250
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:52,800
Gaye.
What a roster.

2251
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:53,873
Wow.
He's just really into talented black 

2252
01:44:55,021 --> 01:44:55,854
eyes.
Yeah.

2253
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:57,900
Wow.
But you're not answering the question.

2254
01:44:57,930 --> 01:44:58,440
Oh,
I'm sorry.

2255
01:44:58,440 --> 01:45:00,600
In the simulator,
how long,

2256
01:45:00,660 --> 01:45:01,493
how long before you started having sex 
with you or you decide to have sex with 

2257
01:45:03,181 --> 01:45:04,840
a guy like in a simulator,
it's like the,

2258
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:07,150
for like 10 thousands of years you're 
having,

2259
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:09,010
you know any kind of you can,
you,

2260
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:14,120
you can literally fuck anybody that you 
want in this simulation and you're,

2261
01:45:14,761 --> 01:45:15,594
you're in there for a long time.
So you go through fucking every single 

2262
01:45:19,231 --> 01:45:24,040
possible iteration of woman ever.
You just fucking fuck it three ways,

2263
01:45:24,041 --> 01:45:26,280
six ways,
thousands of ways.

2264
01:45:26,281 --> 01:45:27,114
You're,
you're like,

2265
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:28,073
you're just laying in a rain forest of,
of beautiful pussies squirting on you 

2266
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:33,473
and fucking,
and everything that your mind could 

2267
01:45:34,711 --> 01:45:37,110
think of sexually.
You're just doing it.

2268
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:41,190
How long before you start adding coq 
into the equation?

2269
01:45:41,370 --> 01:45:45,640
Well,
I think if we did an experiment where we

2270
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:46,473
both took a journey like that,
where I'll see you will be just like we 

2271
01:45:49,991 --> 01:45:52,540
are now,
but it would be a hundred thousand years

2272
01:45:52,541 --> 01:45:54,090
of whatever you want later.
Yeah.

2273
01:45:54,130 --> 01:45:57,280
Okay.
We'll show up hundred thousand years.

2274
01:45:57,300 --> 01:45:58,133
Now.
You will have dick on your breath and I 

2275
01:46:00,851 --> 01:46:01,684
won't,
I would've gone to the whole hundred 

2276
01:46:05,470 --> 01:46:08,860
thousand years with no gay sex cause I 
could do whatever I want.

2277
01:46:08,861 --> 01:46:09,694
Why would I fuck dudes?
I would have sex with girls and then 

2278
01:46:11,981 --> 01:46:12,814
when I was done having sex with girls,
I would take a nap or I do some other 

2279
01:46:15,491 --> 01:46:16,900
shit.
Meanwhile you'd be like,

2280
01:46:16,930 --> 01:46:21,930
I got to stick it somewhere.
Maybe true man.

2281
01:46:22,150 --> 01:46:22,811
Yeah,
I would,

2282
01:46:22,811 --> 01:46:23,644
uh,
I would get to the finish line and I'd 

2283
01:46:25,901 --> 01:46:26,681
be like,
no dude,

2284
01:46:26,681 --> 01:46:27,880
finish line.
I'd be like,

2285
01:46:27,910 --> 01:46:29,140
yeah,
made a hundred thousand years,

2286
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:30,820
hundred thousand years.
That's the race.

2287
01:46:30,850 --> 01:46:32,860
No Dick for a hundred thousand years 
made it right.

2288
01:46:34,990 --> 01:46:39,310
Cause Your eternal he is.
He does have girlfriends,

2289
01:46:39,311 --> 01:46:41,020
man.
Why would you start sucking Dick?

2290
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:42,193
Well,
it's about that time who look at your 

2291
01:46:43,361 --> 01:46:45,340
watch,
but after a couple of years,

2292
01:46:45,470 --> 01:46:49,500
like posted a couple of months,
come on man.

2293
01:46:49,530 --> 01:46:50,760
Why is a hundred thousand years

2294
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:52,980
any different than 20 years did 20 years
ago?

2295
01:46:52,981 --> 01:46:55,290
You feel less likely to suck a Dick and 
you feel today?

2296
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:56,340
No.
You,

2297
01:46:56,340 --> 01:46:57,173
you're the exact same God damn human 
being other than you've learned and 

2298
01:46:58,921 --> 01:47:01,020
gotten better at life,
your desire.

2299
01:47:01,050 --> 01:47:02,940
You still like the same shit.
First of all,

2300
01:47:02,941 --> 01:47:04,530
I want it,
I just want to go back over it.

2301
01:47:04,531 --> 01:47:06,000
Cause you said at the end of the hundred
thousand years,

2302
01:47:06,001 --> 01:47:06,480
I,
I've,

2303
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:07,730
I've to him,
I had a breath.

2304
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:09,053
Here's the thing in my simulator and my 
simulator Cox are going to like have 

2305
01:47:13,831 --> 01:47:15,870
different flavors.
It's not going to just be cock.

2306
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:17,970
It'll be like an owl toy.
That's how they get you.

2307
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:22,080
They get you by Minox.
I hate to say this to you,

2308
01:47:22,081 --> 01:47:23,400
but you dicks,
um,

2309
01:47:23,550 --> 01:47:26,040
you dictates terrible and you need to 
get it.

2310
01:47:26,250 --> 01:47:27,220
You'd get it.
Mentee,

2311
01:47:27,490 --> 01:47:28,323
there's way is a way and then guys are 
going to suck it and then they're going 

2312
01:47:30,681 --> 01:47:31,560
to get meant in their mouth.

2313
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:33,030
Just like if I,
if you suck my Dick,

2314
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:34,740
you get mint in your mouth.
You want to fill it,

2315
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:36,150
just let it just try it.
I don't,

2316
01:47:36,180 --> 01:47:38,130
I know it seems weird,
but it'll get your mentee.

2317
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:40,680
I will fully admit that the end of the 
hundred thousand years,

2318
01:47:40,681 --> 01:47:44,310
I have sucked dicks in the sex emulator,
but the fact that you think you haven't,

2319
01:47:44,340 --> 01:47:46,860
I would like to do a poll,
like I'm going to get to the end.

2320
01:47:46,890 --> 01:47:49,500
I'd be wearing a cowboy hat,
bare chested,

2321
01:47:49,770 --> 01:47:53,220
that's riding a horse of fighting off 
with every fiber of my being,

2322
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:54,533
but I make it,
I don't want my bare chest and I'm bare 

2323
01:47:59,821 --> 01:48:02,130
chested with a Bandana.
Like I'm close,

2324
01:48:02,490 --> 01:48:03,323
I'm close.
I'm shaving my chest with a straight 

2325
01:48:06,391 --> 01:48:08,850
razor and the front mirror at the 
barbershop.

2326
01:48:09,090 --> 01:48:11,340
I'm super close to go and gay,
but I don't.

2327
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:14,010
I make it to a hundred thousand years 
clean.

2328
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:18,570
I have cowboy boots on with no socks.
You lose the race wrong.

2329
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:19,433
I fucking,
when I don't have dick on my breath at 

2330
01:48:20,701 --> 01:48:24,090
the end of the race and I don't have 
those dirty memories either.

2331
01:48:24,091 --> 01:48:24,924
You have dirty,
dirty Mary's idea of butts and shit and 

2332
01:48:27,901 --> 01:48:30,870
Tupperware and slip and slide with just 
stopping with,

2333
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:34,320
I'm suck enough dinosaurs.

2334
01:48:36,490 --> 01:48:38,010
That's right.
You could have anything you want.

2335
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:40,530
You can.
You can but fuck a unicorn in the sky.

2336
01:48:40,950 --> 01:48:42,030
Yeah.
Why not?

2337
01:48:42,150 --> 01:48:45,180
If you could do whatever you want,
if you can do whatever you want,

2338
01:48:45,181 --> 01:48:46,014
you would like full chart.
Like if your life was a virtual 

2339
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:50,513
experience that you can control with 
your mind is if you have a control 

2340
01:48:53,641 --> 01:48:54,474
panel,
you would just start talking decks and 

2341
01:48:56,350 --> 01:48:59,900
Ami.
I'd be bulletproof robbing the banks.

2342
01:48:59,910 --> 01:49:02,250
I'd be fighting vampires.
I didn't make a whole world.

2343
01:49:02,310 --> 01:49:03,840
I would do a bunch of shit.
I'd fly,

2344
01:49:04,140 --> 01:49:05,790
fly all over the place.
It wouldn't land.

2345
01:49:05,791 --> 01:49:08,460
It's suck a dick.
Yeah.

2346
01:49:08,820 --> 01:49:09,653
You know,
if you ever heard the Alan Watts thing 

2347
01:49:10,771 --> 01:49:11,604
about this,
you ever heard Alan Watts to talk about 

2348
01:49:12,511 --> 01:49:13,800
this?
I'm going to talk about a lot,

2349
01:49:13,801 --> 01:49:17,070
but not about that.
Did he really know?

2350
01:49:17,071 --> 01:49:19,800
He talks about,
he does this great thought experiment,

2351
01:49:19,801 --> 01:49:20,940
which is like,
okay,

2352
01:49:21,150 --> 01:49:23,520
if you were able to do anything you 
wanted,

2353
01:49:23,850 --> 01:49:25,460
right?
You've definitely heard this,

2354
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:26,393
but you,
if you were able to do anything you 

2355
01:49:26,851 --> 01:49:27,684
wanted,
if you are an infinite being omnipotent 

2356
01:49:29,071 --> 01:49:29,904
and you can do whatever you want,
you would experiment with making 

2357
01:49:32,611 --> 01:49:35,220
everything and you would try everything 
and you would do everything.

2358
01:49:35,221 --> 01:49:36,840
We're talking about infinity.
You're,

2359
01:49:36,841 --> 01:49:37,674
you're literally in the state of 
creative flow for infinity and you're 

2360
01:49:41,131 --> 01:49:43,200
going to do,
he has a great lecture that I'm going to

2361
01:49:43,201 --> 01:49:44,850
butcher.
You should look it up cause he's so,

2362
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:47,980
he's such an articulate genius.
Like the

2363
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:48,813
essence of the thing is eventually,
eventually upon crew doing everything 

2364
01:49:52,691 --> 01:49:53,524
and creating a universe and creating 
planets and creating a planet where 

2365
01:49:55,781 --> 01:49:56,614
there's life on it and being a God that 
communicates with the beings on the 

2366
01:49:59,651 --> 01:50:00,484
planet,
you're going to start thinking to 

2367
01:50:01,301 --> 01:50:02,134
yourself,
I wonder what would happen if I made 

2368
01:50:04,811 --> 01:50:08,890
myself one of the beings on the planet 
and couldn't remember that I was God.

2369
01:50:09,610 --> 01:50:11,890
And that's what you are.
That's what we are,

2370
01:50:11,891 --> 01:50:16,360
is we are one of the experiments of the 
divine seeing shit.

2371
01:50:16,390 --> 01:50:17,223
I wonder what happens if I forget that 
I'm capable of creating anything that I 

2372
01:50:19,871 --> 01:50:20,860
want,
whenever I want,

2373
01:50:20,861 --> 01:50:21,694
that I've made the entire universe.
Let me turn myself into this hyper 

2374
01:50:24,281 --> 01:50:28,240
limited version of myself with no memory
of what I was in.

2375
01:50:28,241 --> 01:50:30,880
Play that game at that level.
Cause it's a lot more fun.

2376
01:50:30,881 --> 01:50:32,350
It's amusing.
It's exciting.

2377
01:50:32,830 --> 01:50:34,270
Right.
And that's,

2378
01:50:34,271 --> 01:50:35,104
and,
and that's when Alan Watts starts 

2379
01:50:36,851 --> 01:50:41,650
talking about which cox he would 
simulate inside that machine.

2380
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:43,173
No,
no.

2381
01:50:43,480 --> 01:50:44,313
But yeah,
it is.

2382
01:50:44,710 --> 01:50:47,400
You ever heard of Marshall Mcluhan 
speak?

2383
01:50:47,910 --> 01:50:48,960
No.
His,

2384
01:50:48,990 --> 01:50:51,900
there's some interesting youtube videos,
um,

2385
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:53,100
on,
um,

2386
01:50:53,190 --> 01:50:54,023
with the,
you could watch Mcluhan talk and he 

2387
01:50:55,711 --> 01:50:57,180
doesn't look at anything like you'd 
expect.

2388
01:50:57,450 --> 01:50:59,130
It's really interesting.
But his,

2389
01:50:59,131 --> 01:51:02,020
uh,
Kalki not in a non one say,

2390
01:51:02,021 --> 01:51:02,854
calculated his scientific dissection of 
like what's happening with media and 

2391
01:51:08,881 --> 01:51:09,714
what's happening with technology and 
where the future lies is so fascinating 

2392
01:51:13,201 --> 01:51:15,140
because it's from the 1960s.
Yeah.

2393
01:51:15,630 --> 01:51:16,463
And you know,
he's talking about the media is the 

2394
01:51:18,721 --> 01:51:20,910
message I think is the name of the 
lecture and the book.

2395
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:25,410
And that was the same book where he 
wrote one of my all time favorite quotes

2396
01:51:25,650 --> 01:51:28,440
that human beings are the sex organs of 
the machine world.

2397
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:31,740
Like this guy had no internet.
He had,

2398
01:51:31,770 --> 01:51:33,910
I mean nothing was like anything too in 
the bet.

2399
01:51:33,911 --> 01:51:34,744
And most electronics they had,
it's a goddamn calculator and it had 

2400
01:51:36,691 --> 01:51:37,910
nothing to computers.

2401
01:51:37,930 --> 01:51:40,080
They have were giant rooms filled with 
shit.

2402
01:51:40,290 --> 01:51:41,123
You know,
like,

2403
01:51:41,250 --> 01:51:42,083
yeah.
But somehow or another he saw where it 

2404
01:51:43,381 --> 01:51:44,214
was on Cohen.
He was seeing things and and pointing 

2405
01:51:47,161 --> 01:51:47,994
things out just with the very nature of 
our ability to communicate in our 

2406
01:51:51,691 --> 01:51:53,820
ability to innovate and where it was all
headed.

2407
01:51:53,910 --> 01:51:54,743
Yeah.
Fucking fascinating cause you think 

2408
01:51:56,311 --> 01:52:00,270
about how it did play out and no one saw
this common man.

2409
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:01,353
All right.
But no one saw common was what we're on 

2410
01:52:02,581 --> 01:52:03,230
right now.
Right.

2411
01:52:03,230 --> 01:52:04,063
Internet,
this fucking new thing where people can 

2412
01:52:07,261 --> 01:52:08,094
just find out the answer to like we've 
done so far today about scientific 

2413
01:52:12,961 --> 01:52:15,180
questions about descartes car.
Yeah.

2414
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:16,513
Can periods that these,
this was constructed and when did this 

2415
01:52:19,021 --> 01:52:21,360
happen?
And 1,079

2416
01:52:21,361 --> 01:52:22,630
what?
You know you,

2417
01:52:22,890 --> 01:52:23,723
you're,
you're,

2418
01:52:23,730 --> 01:52:28,260
you're getting a download like anybody 
that's ever lived.

2419
01:52:28,261 --> 01:52:29,880
Yeah.
It's amazing.

2420
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:33,060
Everybody can do it.
That this is the thing that's making the

2421
01:52:33,061 --> 01:52:36,360
boundaries between us and the leaders of
the world.

2422
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:41,550
This is why there's such a problem is 
because we have all the information too,

2423
01:52:41,580 --> 01:52:43,380
right?
Everybody has all the information.

2424
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:44,940
Yeah.
And the only thing that's keeping it all

2425
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:45,793
glued together as tradition,
the only thing that's keeping the 

2426
01:52:48,081 --> 01:52:48,914
hierarchies into the position of power,
they're out right now without being 

2427
01:52:51,261 --> 01:52:54,680
completely abandoned and restructured 
from the bottom up.

2428
01:52:54,860 --> 01:52:56,720
The only thing that's keeping them 
together as tradition,

2429
01:52:56,780 --> 01:52:57,920
that's it.
What do you mean?

2430
01:52:58,040 --> 01:52:58,873
The only thing that's keeping government
and just borders and nations and the 

2431
01:53:04,581 --> 01:53:05,414
whole concept that were existing,
that there are a bunch of different 

2432
01:53:07,431 --> 01:53:08,264
countries and there's a bunch of 
different leaders and this guy controls 

2433
01:53:10,530 --> 01:53:10,761
the,
sure,

2434
01:53:10,761 --> 01:53:11,210
sure,
sure.

2435
01:53:11,210 --> 01:53:13,220
The only thing that's keeping that 
together as tradition.

2436
01:53:13,250 --> 01:53:14,083
The only thing if,
if we eventually can communicate with 

2437
01:53:16,881 --> 01:53:21,881
each other in a way that for goes all of
the current limitations and all the past

2438
01:53:22,551 --> 01:53:23,384
limitations,
something that bypasses all that stuff 

2439
01:53:24,981 --> 01:53:25,814
it takes,
one of the first things is going to go 

2440
01:53:27,260 --> 01:53:29,570
is the illogical traditions.
But,

2441
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:33,710
but it seems like its traditions being 
guarded by dudes with guns.

2442
01:53:34,010 --> 01:53:34,843
They are,
but those dudes with guns are going to 

2443
01:53:36,531 --> 01:53:40,280
die and new young dudes with guns,
you're going to take their place.

2444
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:42,950
This is just a,
I mean it might take generations,

2445
01:53:43,100 --> 01:53:43,933
but this is what happens with ideas.
It just happening so fast now and some 

2446
01:53:47,241 --> 01:53:48,074
of the people with the old Id,
they were born and raised with the old 

2447
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:51,290
items.
They're still around.

2448
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:52,980
They're still stuck in this old 
sistance.

2449
01:53:53,070 --> 01:53:53,903
Right.
But then this new system has blossomed 

2450
01:53:55,191 --> 01:53:57,000
around.
They're trapped shitting

2451
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:57,833
bricks.
They're shitting bricks and they're 

2452
01:53:58,261 --> 01:53:59,970
trying to stop it.
Exactly.

2453
01:54:00,030 --> 01:54:02,880
And they're actively trying to stop it.
Did you hear that shit?

2454
01:54:02,881 --> 01:54:03,714
Jeff sessions said,
I don't mean to keep harping on that 

2455
01:54:05,161 --> 01:54:05,994
guy,
but he,

2456
01:54:06,150 --> 01:54:07,440
he,
he,

2457
01:54:07,780 --> 01:54:08,613
he said that like he just came out again
saying that he thinks that the opioid 

2458
01:54:13,380 --> 01:54:14,213
epidemic as they call it,
is being partially fueled by marijuana 

2459
01:54:18,360 --> 01:54:19,193
is a gateway drug that uh,
marijuana is getting people on a 

2460
01:54:23,401 --> 01:54:26,790
painkillers,
which is a completely raw,

2461
01:54:26,820 --> 01:54:27,451
it's not,
I mean,

2462
01:54:27,451 --> 01:54:29,130
not only is it,
is it wrong,

2463
01:54:29,131 --> 01:54:34,131
it's like they can show statistics that 
seem to indicate that the opposite.

2464
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:35,780
The opposite.
Yeah.

2465
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:39,240
But that crazy fuck is saying it 
publicly.

2466
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:43,130
Like it's real and it's not.
And the too,

2467
01:54:43,230 --> 01:54:44,063
just the fact that like,
that man is allowed to continue having 

2468
01:54:47,551 --> 01:54:48,384
his job,
which theoretically somebody who was in 

2469
01:54:50,491 --> 01:54:51,324
his position should be so hyper aware of
the data on all drugs because a person 

2470
01:54:58,111 --> 01:54:58,944
in that position,
we need a person just like you were 

2471
01:55:01,111 --> 01:55:01,944
saying,
we need shepherds like this fucking 

2472
01:55:03,481 --> 01:55:04,650
fentanyl shit,
man.

2473
01:55:05,060 --> 01:55:06,090
I,
one of my friends,

2474
01:55:06,240 --> 01:55:07,620
he lost his,
his,

2475
01:55:07,740 --> 01:55:08,573
his wife to this.
So I ended up so many people are dying 

2476
01:55:10,801 --> 01:55:11,634
because of this.
Like we know a couple people that have 

2477
01:55:13,411 --> 01:55:14,760
died from it.
It's terrible.

2478
01:55:14,761 --> 01:55:17,170
It's Tom Petty.
It's so sad.

2479
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:19,350
It's terrible.
But we need,

2480
01:55:19,590 --> 01:55:22,750
so we need to have some regulatory 
force.

2481
01:55:22,760 --> 01:55:23,593
It's making sure that these poisons,
but they're not regulating that they're 

2482
01:55:25,981 --> 01:55:28,440
going after the stuff that's the most 
safest,

2483
01:55:28,441 --> 01:55:30,450
the most beneficial.
Medicinal.

2484
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:33,570
Could you imagine having a podcast with 
Jeff sessions?

2485
01:55:33,820 --> 01:55:38,100
Is You sitting across from Jeff sessions
for three hours and talking to him about

2486
01:55:38,101 --> 01:55:38,881
things?
Dude,

2487
01:55:38,881 --> 01:55:42,090
I've heard and this is like,
I hate this.

2488
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:44,040
I smells like salt.
I hate

2489
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:45,810
to say this.
I don't want to say this.

2490
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:48,540
I've heard he's like funny and he's 
like,

2491
01:55:48,541 --> 01:55:52,570
likes to argue and he's cool out with.
That's what sucks.

2492
01:55:52,610 --> 01:55:54,480
Yeah,
you want them to be like smelly.

2493
01:55:54,550 --> 01:55:56,160
Say that.
But if you had him on a podcast,

2494
01:55:56,161 --> 01:55:58,260
I bet you chip away through all that.
All those,

2495
01:55:59,100 --> 01:56:00,440
that party personality,
no,

2496
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:01,830
these people,
this is a problem,

2497
01:56:01,831 --> 01:56:02,641
man.
These people,

2498
01:56:02,641 --> 01:56:04,920
they're not lizards.
They're not lizards.

2499
01:56:04,921 --> 01:56:06,690
That's a problem.
If there were fucking lizards,

2500
01:56:06,691 --> 01:56:08,970
if only jeff sessions was a fucking 
lizard.

2501
01:56:09,660 --> 01:56:11,490
The problem is it's like they're not 
like that.

2502
01:56:11,491 --> 01:56:13,260
They're just,
they're confused.

2503
01:56:15,480 --> 01:56:17,460
Yes.
Mass does sessions.

2504
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:20,010
Podcast is one.
Thank you.

2505
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:22,710
Father.
Thank you.

2506
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:24,450
Thank you.
Thank you.

2507
01:56:24,750 --> 01:56:25,583
Know,
the problem is we have to have 

2508
01:56:25,801 --> 01:56:28,830
compassion for these people because 
they're not bad.

2509
01:56:29,010 --> 01:56:29,843
They're misguided and they're informed 
and they can be turned around with the 

2510
01:56:33,151 --> 01:56:34,440
proper experiences.
Right.

2511
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:37,470
And if they're willing to abandon their 
previous notions,

2512
01:56:37,471 --> 01:56:38,304
but the problem is so many people are so
invested in their identity that it's 

2513
01:56:41,281 --> 01:56:42,114
impossible for them to give up.
Their notion is just like the 

2514
01:56:43,411 --> 01:56:44,244
Egyptologists.
I don't want to look at the possibility 

2515
01:56:46,140 --> 01:56:46,973
that may be there've been doing these 
fantastic constructions in Egypt a lot 

2516
01:56:50,761 --> 01:56:53,230
longer than we think,
which is entirely possible.

2517
01:56:53,320 --> 01:56:54,153
It doesn't mean that the great pay,
I mean take it back to Egypt one last 

2518
01:56:56,431 --> 01:56:57,264
time.
Like no one's doubting that the Great 

2519
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:01,620
Pyramid of Giza was constructed at 
somewhere around 2,500

2520
01:57:01,621 --> 01:57:02,454
BC according to the previous or all the 
data that we have right now because 

2521
01:57:05,371 --> 01:57:06,204
they've been able to carbon date stuff 
that they find like in between the 

2522
01:57:08,011 --> 01:57:08,760
stones.

2523
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:10,920
They're pretty sure that it's somewhere 
in that range.

2524
01:57:10,921 --> 01:57:11,970
You know,
they're off here.

2525
01:57:11,971 --> 01:57:14,430
They're a little bit,
but there's some other construction that

2526
01:57:14,970 --> 01:57:17,280
John Anthony West pointed out that's 
buried under sand.

2527
01:57:17,281 --> 01:57:18,114
They find that's like wait,
like it might've been buried for who 

2528
01:57:19,981 --> 01:57:20,814
knows how fucking long.
And it's a different style of 

2529
01:57:22,021 --> 01:57:22,854
construction and it looks really old.
Like one of the things about the styles 

2530
01:57:26,311 --> 01:57:28,910
of construction and the things that they
find in,

2531
01:57:28,911 --> 01:57:29,610
in,
um,

2532
01:57:29,610 --> 01:57:33,780
in Egypt is a lot of it is buried in 
sand after why even the Sphinx itself,

2533
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:35,310
you know,
when they found the Sphinx.

2534
01:57:35,490 --> 01:57:39,840
And one of the things that one of the 
people that is in,

2535
01:57:39,890 --> 01:57:42,180
uh,
some of the ancient hieroglyphs,

2536
01:57:42,181 --> 01:57:45,630
it's attributed to being alive at the 
same time as a scroll.

2537
01:57:45,631 --> 01:57:46,464
I forget which pharaoh,
but he heard in a dream that if he 

2538
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:52,193
uncovered the Sphinx,
that he would become pharaoh of Egypt 

2539
01:57:54,660 --> 01:57:56,630
because it was covered in sand,
like to,

2540
01:57:56,640 --> 01:58:00,870
he had written down at that time and 
this was like 2000 bc or something crazy

2541
01:58:00,871 --> 01:58:01,380
like that.

2542
01:58:01,380 --> 01:58:03,870
It was covered in sand then.
Wow.

2543
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:07,040
They don't even know.
I mean there's so little they know about

2544
01:58:07,050 --> 01:58:09,120
you made it and why you know the answer 
to this.

2545
01:58:09,540 --> 01:58:11,640
How,
and this is probably a dumb question,

2546
01:58:11,670 --> 01:58:14,910
I'm sorry,
but not deep as the sand out there.

2547
01:58:14,911 --> 01:58:17,430
Like how far down does that fact?
It's a very good question.

2548
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:20,610
That's a very good question.
When does the sand,

2549
01:58:20,611 --> 01:58:24,360
here's the other thing is in San from 
oceans beating down rocks.

2550
01:58:24,780 --> 01:58:26,880
Yeah.
I mean that's what sand is.

2551
01:58:27,090 --> 01:58:27,923
Yeah.
This,

2552
01:58:27,940 --> 01:58:30,330
that's what's the most fucked up thing 
about the desert.

2553
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:32,070
There's,
there's no goddamn ocean,

2554
01:58:32,460 --> 01:58:35,720
but you've got so much sand.
Yeah.

2555
01:58:35,790 --> 01:58:37,800
That is mostly from,
what isn't it?

2556
01:58:37,890 --> 01:58:38,723
I think sans mostly created,
it's probably created few different 

2557
01:58:41,501 --> 01:58:42,334
ways,
but I think it's mostly created by 

2558
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:46,030
oceans beating down rocks.
Right.

2559
01:58:46,540 --> 01:58:49,880
So that's just time.
You're just looking at time.

2560
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:52,870
The craziest fucking stamp of time.
We can look at it.

2561
01:58:52,871 --> 01:58:53,704
Yeah.
How long does it take for an ocean to 

2562
01:58:55,631 --> 01:58:59,260
turn rocks into a Goddamn desert?
Holy Shit,

2563
01:58:59,261 --> 01:59:02,980
dude.
What is under this is Sam Mega Lake.

2564
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:06,100
Oh,
I need the sands of the Sahara desert.

2565
01:59:06,101 --> 01:59:09,370
Scientists have discovered evidence of a
prehistoric mega lake.

2566
01:59:09,430 --> 01:59:13,120
There's a monster down there using 
images of wind blown sediments,

2567
01:59:13,121 --> 01:59:17,140
sediments produced by running water and 
bedrock seen by radar beneath the desert

2568
01:59:17,141 --> 01:59:19,060
sands.
The geologists piece together,

2569
01:59:19,061 --> 01:59:19,894
the profile of an ancient wow.
So goes the sand goes 69 to 141 feet in 

2570
01:59:27,521 --> 01:59:32,521
the Sahara and three feet in the Simpson
desert.

2571
01:59:32,531 --> 01:59:33,364
I don't know where that is.
The depths of sand varies widely around 

2572
01:59:35,591 --> 01:59:37,690
the world.
And I know 141 feet.

2573
01:59:37,990 --> 01:59:40,930
Wow.
141 feet of just sand.

2574
01:59:41,230 --> 01:59:42,063
So am I right?
That sand is created by the ocean 

2575
01:59:44,291 --> 01:59:45,124
beating down rocks.
I think that's true most of the time of 

2576
01:59:47,651 --> 01:59:48,484
maybe it's not true all the time.
It's so nice to be so stupid that you 

2577
01:59:50,921 --> 01:59:51,460
just ask.

2578
01:59:51,460 --> 01:59:54,150
Sounds Fun to figure it out.
Like you get to know,

2579
01:59:54,151 --> 01:59:56,310
like it's great.
No idea.

2580
01:59:56,950 --> 01:59:58,630
Yeah.
I was,

2581
01:59:58,631 --> 01:59:59,464
um,
talking to a Neil degrasse Tyson the 

2582
02:00:01,511 --> 02:00:04,510
other day and he was trying to explain 
to me,

2583
02:00:04,570 --> 02:00:06,190
um,
uh,

2584
02:00:06,340 --> 02:00:09,490
escape velocity like any,
he takes my shoe,

2585
02:00:09,491 --> 02:00:10,324
he goes,
let me see your shoe and he takes my 

2586
02:00:11,351 --> 02:00:13,900
shoe and he goes,
now if I throw this up in there,

2587
02:00:13,901 --> 02:00:17,110
it's going to come down.
But if I throw it hard enough,

2588
02:00:17,560 --> 02:00:20,770
it will escape the pull of the gravity 
of the earth.

2589
02:00:20,771 --> 02:00:22,300
And once it's free,
it'll go on forever.

2590
02:00:22,330 --> 02:00:23,270
Yeah.
You see it?

2591
02:00:23,271 --> 02:00:24,050
They're like,
wow,

2592
02:00:24,050 --> 02:00:26,560
that's fucking cool.
Yeah.

2593
02:00:26,750 --> 02:00:29,110
Like he tried to like put that in your 
head like,

2594
02:00:29,111 --> 02:00:30,010
wait a minute.
What

2595
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:32,730
goes on forever?
Isn't that the problem?

2596
02:00:32,790 --> 02:00:36,300
Now this it sky,
this is great to just dummies talking.

2597
02:00:36,340 --> 02:00:37,173
Yeah.
Isn't this the problem with the moon is 

2598
02:00:38,851 --> 02:00:41,970
that not the problem with the moon,
but if you jump on the moon,

2599
02:00:42,330 --> 02:00:43,163
you can escape the escape.
Like it's easier to get out of the 

2600
02:00:45,181 --> 02:00:46,590
escape velocity.
The moon.

2601
02:00:46,620 --> 02:00:47,520
No,
it's one six.

2602
02:00:47,521 --> 02:00:48,900
Earth's gravity.
Oh really?

2603
02:00:48,901 --> 02:00:50,340
Yeah.
I thought we started on the moon.

2604
02:00:50,341 --> 02:00:51,990
You can like,
no,

2605
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:53,341
no,
no,

2606
02:00:53,341 --> 02:00:54,050
no,
no.

2607
02:00:54,050 --> 02:00:59,050
Can theoretically you can jump higher.
And if you believe in NASA,

2608
02:01:00,201 --> 02:01:01,034
bro,
there's some videos of guys jumping 

2609
02:01:02,571 --> 02:01:03,710
around on the moon.
Yeah.

2610
02:01:03,770 --> 02:01:04,603
The problem with the videos of people on
the moon is that there are videos that 

2611
02:01:08,841 --> 02:01:09,674
look 100% fake,
but guys fall forward and it looks like 

2612
02:01:13,191 --> 02:01:14,024
they get yanked up by wires.
There's a lot of video that looks fake 

2613
02:01:16,971 --> 02:01:19,610
as fuck.
I don't know if it's fake.

2614
02:01:19,670 --> 02:01:20,503
I don't know if it just looked fake 
because it's one sixth of the Earth's 

2615
02:01:22,611 --> 02:01:23,444
gravity and we don't know what that 
really looks like until you see it play 

2616
02:01:25,221 --> 02:01:26,054
out.
But there's some videos of guys falling 

2617
02:01:27,081 --> 02:01:29,480
down face first and getting yanked back 
up.

2618
02:01:29,481 --> 02:01:30,770
It looks like the yanked by court.

2619
02:01:30,890 --> 02:01:32,830
Have you seen that picture of that thing
that looks at Jamie?

2620
02:01:33,180 --> 02:01:35,000
What after we talked about this last 
time,

2621
02:01:35,390 --> 02:01:36,223
some people send in videos of an NFL.
Players do the exact same thing in the 

2622
02:01:38,901 --> 02:01:39,860
end.
Yeah,

2623
02:01:39,861 --> 02:01:40,340
super

2624
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:41,173
athletes.
It's three or four guys doing throw 

2625
02:01:42,321 --> 02:01:43,154
their body,
but they don't have a giant pack on 

2626
02:01:44,241 --> 02:01:45,920
their back.
And when wearing helmets,

2627
02:01:45,921 --> 02:01:46,754
they're wearing helmets.
That Shit's light compared to what the 

2628
02:01:48,381 --> 02:01:49,490
astronauts are wearing.
Dude,

2629
02:01:49,530 --> 02:01:54,290
astronauts have like a once in a suit 
that keeps them grabbing a drink concept

2630
02:01:54,291 --> 02:01:55,160
is the suit.
If there,

2631
02:01:55,161 --> 02:01:57,580
the concept is they're not even on the 
fucking moon and then that suit,

2632
02:01:57,590 --> 02:01:58,423
it could just be paper Miss Shea,
but some of the ones where they're 

2633
02:02:00,291 --> 02:02:03,080
pitched completely forward and they just
go badly what it is.

2634
02:02:03,081 --> 02:02:04,130
I'm trying to find it right now.
Yeah,

2635
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:05,900
I would love to see it.
That's interesting.

2636
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:08,690
So you,
you're still wavering on whether we went

2637
02:02:08,691 --> 02:02:10,050
to the mint.
I'm more weight.

2638
02:02:10,070 --> 02:02:10,903
I'm numb.
I'm too dumb and uneducated to really 

2639
02:02:13,371 --> 02:02:14,000
know.
Right.

2640
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:17,630
But I am wavering more on the 
possibility that some of the footage was

2641
02:02:17,631 --> 02:02:20,740
faked super quick.
It's a five second videos like no.

2642
02:02:20,870 --> 02:02:21,703
Interesting.
Go ahead.

2643
02:02:23,340 --> 02:02:24,173
Boom.

2644
02:02:25,430 --> 02:02:28,310
That is not the same thing Jamie.
I can do that.

2645
02:02:28,340 --> 02:02:30,950
Super similar bull shit.
I can do that.

2646
02:02:31,010 --> 02:02:32,930
That guy goes to,
I'll do that right now.

2647
02:02:32,950 --> 02:02:33,783
Find another one.
The guy goes to his knees and then uses 

2648
02:02:35,540 --> 02:02:37,850
his momentum.
The pop up from his knees.

2649
02:02:37,880 --> 02:02:39,740
I've seen some that look pretty crazy 
though,

2650
02:02:39,741 --> 02:02:40,220
man.
Dude,

2651
02:02:40,220 --> 02:02:43,530
that's ridiculous.
The moon ones are way more preposterous.

2652
02:02:43,680 --> 02:02:46,670
Better examples in that though.
There's super athletes.

2653
02:02:46,730 --> 02:02:47,563
Yeah.
What they're doing is springing up and 

2654
02:02:49,071 --> 02:02:51,170
you can see the kinetic energy from 
their legs.

2655
02:02:51,171 --> 02:02:53,270
It's forcing them up.
They're super athletes,

2656
02:02:53,271 --> 02:02:54,030
right?
They,

2657
02:02:54,030 --> 02:02:54,863
they show off.
Those guys do back flips and shit all 

2658
02:02:56,151 --> 02:02:56,984
the time there.
They are physically capable of doing 

2659
02:02:58,641 --> 02:02:59,474
things in a normal person cannot do,
but they're not physically capable of 

2660
02:03:02,091 --> 02:03:02,924
defying physics.
What you're seeing in a lot of those 

2661
02:03:04,641 --> 02:03:08,240
moon videos looks like someone's defined
because it's like they pitch forward and

2662
02:03:08,241 --> 02:03:09,170
they bounce back up.

2663
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:12,680
I think they shot a bunch of shit and I 
think some of the video,

2664
02:03:12,681 --> 02:03:15,380
if you're going into space and you're 
experiencing deep radiation,

2665
02:03:15,381 --> 02:03:17,990
the van Allen radiation belts and from 
the sun did,

2666
02:03:17,991 --> 02:03:20,720
you can't even go through the fucking x 
ray machine at the airport,

2667
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:23,720
the old x ray machines with film.
They wouldn't let you.

2668
02:03:23,960 --> 02:03:26,270
Cause if you went through with Phil and 
would kill your fucking film,

2669
02:03:26,370 --> 02:03:27,203
so how are they getting these perfect 
videos and photos and none of them are 

2670
02:03:29,271 --> 02:03:30,104
fucked up by radiation.
It's entirely possible that they did go 

2671
02:03:33,081 --> 02:03:33,914
to the moon,
but they faked a bunch of the film 

2672
02:03:35,601 --> 02:03:39,320
footage because they wanted to have 
something and they couldn't really bring

2673
02:03:39,321 --> 02:03:41,480
anything back.
It's entirely possible.

2674
02:03:41,630 --> 02:03:45,200
There's fake footage from the Russians.
100% is a precedent.

2675
02:03:45,500 --> 02:03:46,333
The footage of Yuri Gagarin when he's 
circling the earth for the first time 

2676
02:03:50,181 --> 02:03:51,980
and he goes on a rocket and the first 
guy in space,

2677
02:03:52,340 --> 02:03:53,600
it's fake as fuck dude.

2678
02:03:53,930 --> 02:03:56,450
He's inside this tiny little compartment
and all sudden there's,

2679
02:03:56,540 --> 02:03:59,750
they've got ruined there for a camera.
Get the fuck Outta here bitch.

2680
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:01,700
You See a light source this way,
the light source.

2681
02:04:01,701 --> 02:04:02,534
That way he's got dueling shadows behind
him cause they got lights set up in 

2682
02:04:05,481 --> 02:04:08,390
there cause they're filming him inside 
this capsule.

2683
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:10,430
No,
he shot up in the space.

2684
02:04:10,490 --> 02:04:12,470
You really did do it but they couldn't 
fit it.

2685
02:04:12,471 --> 02:04:14,420
Bad damn camera in his tiny little 
capsule.

2686
02:04:14,450 --> 02:04:15,081
Right.
It's,

2687
02:04:15,081 --> 02:04:18,320
there's no room so they just faked it 
after the fact.

2688
02:04:18,350 --> 02:04:19,940
Make sense?
Of course it makes sense.

2689
02:04:19,941 --> 02:04:22,130
A lot of money.
There was no internet back then.

2690
02:04:22,250 --> 02:04:26,600
There was no vhs tapes back then.
They broadcast something on tv as far as

2691
02:04:26,601 --> 02:04:27,434
their eyes and their mind goes,
that was the only time people are going 

2692
02:04:29,991 --> 02:04:30,920
to see it.
Right?

2693
02:04:31,040 --> 02:04:32,710
All they have to do is show it to you 
once,

2694
02:04:32,930 --> 02:04:33,590
pull it off.

2695
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:34,423
Nobody ever imagined you'd be able to 
pull it up on your phone or to stoners 

2696
02:04:38,581 --> 02:04:41,100
like you and me.
We'll be watching on a podcast.

2697
02:04:41,300 --> 02:04:45,030
It's even find the video of Yuri Gagarin
from inside his,

2698
02:04:45,570 --> 02:04:47,490
what would you call those things?
Pods.

2699
02:04:47,491 --> 02:04:50,850
Pods,
which call it Yuri Gagarin in space.

2700
02:04:50,940 --> 02:04:53,490
You Watch it.
You go get the fuck Outta here.

2701
02:04:53,670 --> 02:04:55,110
You watch it and you go,
what?

2702
02:04:55,330 --> 02:04:58,370
That is fake.
That is not him or this.

2703
02:04:58,380 --> 02:05:02,500
Not Him in space rather.
So your nose and blast off.

2704
02:05:04,060 --> 02:05:06,890
Here he is.
He's getting on the bus studies.

2705
02:05:06,900 --> 02:05:09,720
Headache to space.
I can't believe it.

2706
02:05:09,721 --> 02:05:11,640
You're ready?
Show me where are you?

2707
02:05:11,641 --> 02:05:13,020
Right,
so he's in this state.

2708
02:05:13,021 --> 02:05:14,190
Look at that.
I didn't back it up.

2709
02:05:14,250 --> 02:05:16,230
That was it.
That's it.

2710
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:19,810
Watch this.
Are we good?

2711
02:05:19,930 --> 02:05:21,370
We're good.
We're going to strap up.

2712
02:05:21,450 --> 02:05:25,690
How am I go and turn off to look at the 
lights?

2713
02:05:26,020 --> 02:05:26,590
You see,
hold up,

2714
02:05:26,590 --> 02:05:27,550
back up,
back up,

2715
02:05:27,880 --> 02:05:28,571
back up.
Stop.

2716
02:05:28,571 --> 02:05:30,610
Pause it.
Leave the shadows.

2717
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:32,320
Shadow to the left.
Shout out to the right.

2718
02:05:32,420 --> 02:05:33,790
This is fucking lights in front of them.

2719
02:05:35,480 --> 02:05:37,460
They would lights in there.
He's in his tiny little cat.

2720
02:05:37,490 --> 02:05:39,830
This tiny little pod.
How's it lit up?

2721
02:05:40,850 --> 02:05:42,560
No,
maybe they just have,

2722
02:05:42,561 --> 02:05:45,040
I don't want,
I mean it's still windows.

2723
02:05:45,050 --> 02:05:46,850
Why couldn't they have lights in there 
joe?

2724
02:05:47,720 --> 02:05:52,430
Because they've got no room had it seems
like there's enough lights back then.

2725
02:05:52,431 --> 02:05:56,920
Think about these candles.
They campfire you fire in there.

2726
02:05:56,990 --> 02:05:59,960
I saw a few breakdowns of the moon 
landing two that said it would be way,

2727
02:05:59,961 --> 02:06:00,794
way,
way harder to fake it back then than it 

2728
02:06:02,061 --> 02:06:03,770
would have been to actually just,
I read that too.

2729
02:06:03,800 --> 02:06:04,700
Yeah,
I've heard that too,

2730
02:06:04,850 --> 02:06:07,160
but I don't think we're talking about 
faking going to the moon.

2731
02:06:08,030 --> 02:06:09,200
You're not understanding what I'm 
saying.

2732
02:06:09,560 --> 02:06:10,393
We're talking about faking footage,
not talking about faking going to the 

2733
02:06:13,390 --> 02:06:15,560
moon like I think they probably did go 
to the moon,

2734
02:06:15,920 --> 02:06:16,753
but I would imagine that at least some 
of the footage you're seeing is horse 

2735
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:20,630
shit.
From what I,

2736
02:06:20,810 --> 02:06:24,980
I wasn't obviously alive then.
It was like a 140 minute live stream.

2737
02:06:27,010 --> 02:06:27,980
No,
no,

2738
02:06:27,981 --> 02:06:28,581
it's not.
No.

2739
02:06:28,581 --> 02:06:30,710
If you,
if you just have people in orbit,

2740
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:33,530
it wouldn't be hard to fake.
Look,

2741
02:06:34,040 --> 02:06:36,500
I think it'd be harder to go there.
That would be to fake it.

2742
02:06:37,160 --> 02:06:39,770
I think going there,
if they did go to there and I think they

2743
02:06:39,771 --> 02:06:43,130
probably did was an unbelievably 
difficult thing to do,

2744
02:06:43,340 --> 02:06:46,190
but like thinking that they were there,
how hard would that be?

2745
02:06:46,940 --> 02:06:47,773
Like?
Like after the fact like filming 

2746
02:06:49,371 --> 02:06:50,204
footage.
We're filming footage of them in orbit 

2747
02:06:51,651 --> 02:06:55,250
and is the part you can't,
that would have been a mile of film Joe.

2748
02:06:55,251 --> 02:06:56,084
It's really interesting.
Why do you know that all that Shit's 

2749
02:06:58,581 --> 02:06:59,414
missing?
You know all the original footage is 

2750
02:07:00,981 --> 02:07:03,260
missing.
That's the weirdest fucking thing,

2751
02:07:03,590 --> 02:07:04,423
man.
Yeah,

2752
02:07:04,700 --> 02:07:06,260
I know you're doing,
you're being skeptical guy.

2753
02:07:06,261 --> 02:07:07,094
I looked it up.
It's missing or a bigger one that only 

2754
02:07:09,471 --> 02:07:11,540
that you know what else is missing but 
telemetry data,

2755
02:07:11,900 --> 02:07:12,733
all the ones and Zeros that show the 
location of the capsule or whatever the 

2756
02:07:15,381 --> 02:07:16,190
fuck it is on the waist.

2757
02:07:16,190 --> 02:07:17,023
I thought from what I read,
they still have that data that just the 

2758
02:07:18,921 --> 02:07:20,480
original like paper,
it was on it.

2759
02:07:20,481 --> 02:07:23,030
The original magnetic tapes got reused 
because they needed to.

2760
02:07:23,060 --> 02:07:24,320
Okay.
Well why would you say that?

2761
02:07:24,440 --> 02:07:25,273
Unless you just,
why don't you just google it and find 

2762
02:07:26,271 --> 02:07:27,110
out?
That's what I read.

2763
02:07:27,140 --> 02:07:28,260
I read when last time,
you know,

2764
02:07:28,660 --> 02:07:29,493
what'd you read?
I read that that original tapes got 

2765
02:07:31,551 --> 02:07:32,384
written over because they needed to 
magnetic tape because there was a 

2766
02:07:34,191 --> 02:07:35,520
shortage at some point.
Right.

2767
02:07:35,620 --> 02:07:38,500
So but still,
but the date is still somewhere else.

2768
02:07:38,590 --> 02:07:43,000
There was a short,
they recorded over the original tapes of

2769
02:07:43,001 --> 02:07:43,834
the fucking moon landing.
How much of a shortage of magnetic tape 

2770
02:07:46,631 --> 02:07:47,464
do you have?
Where are you going to record over all 

2771
02:07:49,300 --> 02:07:53,040
of the video from the mother fucking 
moon landing hank it.

2772
02:07:53,080 --> 02:07:56,740
We got a presidential parade from 76 you
want to keep that?

2773
02:07:56,740 --> 02:07:57,640
Yeah,
Kate,

2774
02:07:57,641 --> 02:07:59,830
that keep,
that's a good one.

2775
02:07:59,980 --> 02:08:02,530
It's like if you're going through like 
your family's vhs tapes,

2776
02:08:02,531 --> 02:08:04,690
like what do you want picnic from 82 
yeah,

2777
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:06,730
that was when Mikey threw up.
Save it,

2778
02:08:06,731 --> 02:08:09,460
save it.
They're saving everything,

2779
02:08:09,461 --> 02:08:12,270
but they record over the fucking moon 
landing.

2780
02:08:12,790 --> 02:08:15,700
Let's just fucking record over the first
time in human history.

2781
02:08:15,701 --> 02:08:19,450
Literally the craziest thing in human 
history to ever record.

2782
02:08:19,451 --> 02:08:21,790
Oh,
it is the dumbest thing in human.

2783
02:08:21,820 --> 02:08:24,490
I'm not saying they didn't do it.
They might have,

2784
02:08:25,390 --> 02:08:29,110
the official story might be legit 
casino,

2785
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:30,033
but it might not.
Where do you put your money on the moon 

2786
02:08:31,390 --> 02:08:31,871
lighting?
Because you know what?

2787
02:08:31,871 --> 02:08:34,510
I'm detecting Joe when we first got to 
be friends,

2788
02:08:34,990 --> 02:08:35,823
as I recall,
you didn't really believe in the 

2789
02:08:37,991 --> 02:08:38,824
moonlight.
I didn't believe in it at all and then 

2790
02:08:39,851 --> 02:08:40,684
you went through a phase because if the 
podcast and having a lot of 

2791
02:08:43,691 --> 02:08:44,524
conversations with different people or 
something happened where you started 

2792
02:08:45,911 --> 02:08:49,030
shifting your ideas and thinking,
we did go to the moon.

2793
02:08:49,300 --> 02:08:50,133
No,
I started shifting my ideas about 

2794
02:08:50,921 --> 02:08:53,890
everything.
Or Moon landing is just an example.

2795
02:08:53,891 --> 02:08:54,724
That's an extreme example of a position 
I took that I think represents there is 

2796
02:08:58,480 --> 02:09:00,220
there is mystery to that story.
Yeah.

2797
02:09:00,250 --> 02:09:02,650
There's a lot of mystery to that store 
is still to this day.

2798
02:09:02,770 --> 02:09:06,550
There's a bunch of weird shit connected 
to the moon landing a lot of it.

2799
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,080
So when I,
and people are like,

2800
02:09:08,081 --> 02:09:09,790
no,
there's not shut up.

2801
02:09:09,970 --> 02:09:10,840
No,
there is,

2802
02:09:10,930 --> 02:09:11,763
there is.
There's a bunch of weird shit connected 

2803
02:09:13,001 --> 02:09:13,834
to it.
How about the fact that they give a 

2804
02:09:14,081 --> 02:09:17,470
fucking moon rock to a,
was it the Prime Minister of Holland,

2805
02:09:18,170 --> 02:09:19,003
uh,
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin and 

2806
02:09:23,171 --> 02:09:28,060
Michael Collins signed on this plaque 
and they gave this moon rock to this guy

2807
02:09:28,061 --> 02:09:31,210
in Holland and it turned out to be 
petrified wood.

2808
02:09:31,810 --> 02:09:33,790
It was fake.
Like it's,

2809
02:09:33,970 --> 02:09:34,803
there's so much weird shit connected to 
the moon landing that it makes you go 

2810
02:09:37,541 --> 02:09:38,380
like wow.

2811
02:09:38,650 --> 02:09:41,680
Right.
Creepy speeches that Neil Armstrong gave

2812
02:09:41,681 --> 02:09:46,681
25 years after the moon landing,
talking about uncovering hidden truths,

2813
02:09:46,820 --> 02:09:49,240
patrice protective layers that are,
you know,

2814
02:09:49,900 --> 02:09:50,733
oh great deeds that could be done to 
those who could remove one of truth 

2815
02:09:53,471 --> 02:09:55,810
protective layers.
This is a speech that he gave.

2816
02:09:55,870 --> 02:09:56,703
There's so much weird shit.
Some people say there's alien relics as 

2817
02:10:00,250 --> 02:10:00,821
people.
Ridiculous.

2818
02:10:00,821 --> 02:10:01,654
There's no evidence to that.
But there is evidence that these people 

2819
02:10:02,831 --> 02:10:04,590
are talking really weird about the moon 
landing.

2820
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:06,250
Jamie,
can you peel a clean set?

2821
02:10:06,550 --> 02:10:07,383
What Clinton said in his book,
he wrote a book called my life and in 

2822
02:10:10,060 --> 02:10:10,893
one of the chapters in my life he talks 
about a conversation that he had been a 

2823
02:10:13,121 --> 02:10:14,980
carpenter when people landed on the 
moon.

2824
02:10:14,981 --> 02:10:17,500
He was working in a construction site 
and the guy said,

2825
02:10:17,501 --> 02:10:18,334
I don't believe it for a second.
Those television fellers they can fake 

2826
02:10:21,161 --> 02:10:21,851
anything.
He says.

2827
02:10:21,851 --> 02:10:22,684
Back then I thought the guy was a crank,
but after eight years in the White 

2828
02:10:25,540 --> 02:10:26,373
House,
I was starting to think that maybe he 

2829
02:10:26,981 --> 02:10:27,814
was ahead of his time.
Now this is what bill fucking Clinton 

2830
02:10:31,620 --> 02:10:34,340
wrote in his book,
my life.

2831
02:10:34,490 --> 02:10:35,323
Wow.
Why would the fuck would you ever write 

2832
02:10:37,161 --> 02:10:40,370
that if you were the God damn president 
of the United States for eight years and

2833
02:10:40,371 --> 02:10:40,941
you're saying,
hey,

2834
02:10:40,941 --> 02:10:43,240
maybe the guy who thought we didn't go 
to the moon was right,

2835
02:10:44,300 --> 02:10:45,133
might not be right.
It might be that they faked some 

2836
02:10:47,841 --> 02:10:50,120
footage.
They did fake some photos.

2837
02:10:50,121 --> 02:10:50,954
There's a photo of micro Colin's who's 
on a moonwalk from like Gemini 15 and 

2838
02:10:55,791 --> 02:10:56,624
it's not a real photo.
It's a photo of him from the test runs 

2839
02:10:59,311 --> 02:11:00,144
that they did.
It's in a warehouse and it blacked out 

2840
02:11:01,910 --> 02:11:04,130
all the background.
It's been proven.

2841
02:11:04,310 --> 02:11:07,100
They reverse the image and blacked out 
the background.

2842
02:11:07,101 --> 02:11:10,850
You could see the two of them,
if you overlay them line up perfectly,

2843
02:11:10,851 --> 02:11:12,680
it's the exact same image,
right?

2844
02:11:12,690 --> 02:11:14,900
So someone,
whether it is a,

2845
02:11:15,250 --> 02:11:16,100
uh,
you know,

2846
02:11:16,101 --> 02:11:21,101
an overzealous pr agent for NASA or a 
journalist at the time who actually made

2847
02:11:21,711 --> 02:11:22,544
that photograph,
but somebody did and tried to pass that 

2848
02:11:25,011 --> 02:11:26,240
photo office space.

2849
02:11:26,270 --> 02:11:29,810
So there's some deception.
We know that one is 100% sure.

2850
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:30,673
So then you look at the other ones,
you look at the videos of guys falling 

2851
02:11:32,931 --> 02:11:33,764
down,
getting yanked back up and the bouncing 

2852
02:11:35,541 --> 02:11:36,374
around like they're on trampolines and 
some videos where they're hiding behind 

2853
02:11:38,481 --> 02:11:39,231
the lunar rover.
Like,

2854
02:11:39,231 --> 02:11:41,510
what the fuck are you doing?
If you guys tear your suits,

2855
02:11:41,511 --> 02:11:42,344
you're dead.
Sure you guys are jumping around on the 

2856
02:11:44,390 --> 02:11:45,650
moon.
Like you're having a party up there.

2857
02:11:45,950 --> 02:11:47,610
Is that real?
Right?

2858
02:11:47,660 --> 02:11:52,160
How come I can't get a fucking regular 
camera through the radar machine?

2859
02:11:52,161 --> 02:11:52,994
The extra mission at the airport?
But you guys can fly through the 

2860
02:11:55,341 --> 02:11:57,830
radiation of space and that should comes
out,

2861
02:11:57,831 --> 02:11:59,570
but what will,
those cameras were insulated.

2862
02:11:59,571 --> 02:12:02,450
There were different kinds of camera.
The camera is not true.

2863
02:12:02,840 --> 02:12:05,480
Housel bad said it.
They were the same God damn cameras.

2864
02:12:05,660 --> 02:12:06,710
It's a regular camera.

2865
02:12:06,740 --> 02:12:07,573
There was no specific protection.
There's nothing unusual about the 

2866
02:12:09,891 --> 02:12:12,440
protection that those cameras had.
It's interesting,

2867
02:12:12,441 --> 02:12:14,090
man.
You've like gone back.

2868
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:15,313
No,
I haven't.

2869
02:12:15,380 --> 02:12:17,330
I think it,
this is the thing,

2870
02:12:17,331 --> 02:12:18,890
man.
I'm not taking any position.

2871
02:12:18,891 --> 02:12:22,190
You're agnostic 100% because I don't 
know anything about space.

2872
02:12:22,310 --> 02:12:25,490
I don't know anything about the physics 
of space travel I go to,

2873
02:12:25,491 --> 02:12:26,324
I don't know anything about the 
requirements of technological 

2874
02:12:27,681 --> 02:12:28,514
requirements,
but I do know it's one of the only 

2875
02:12:30,051 --> 02:12:33,800
things that happened between 1969 in 
1972 and it's not cheaper,

2876
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:36,870
easier and faster to reproduce today.
It's weird.

2877
02:12:36,940 --> 02:12:38,660
It's a weird spent a year.
It's a weird thing.

2878
02:12:39,050 --> 02:12:39,883
This is the only time in history.
People have been more than 400 miles 

2879
02:12:41,691 --> 02:12:43,820
from the earth's surface was always moon
missions,

2880
02:12:44,390 --> 02:12:45,620
all the Apollo missions,
man,

2881
02:12:45,770 --> 02:12:46,603
everything since then,
all the space shuttle stuff inside 400 

2882
02:12:48,771 --> 02:12:51,070
miles satellites,
you know,

2883
02:12:51,120 --> 02:12:52,190
like a space station.

2884
02:12:52,580 --> 02:12:54,690
You talk to people about that part and 
they'll say like,

2885
02:12:54,710 --> 02:12:56,510
we just don't need to go there anymore.
Maybe we don't.

2886
02:12:56,540 --> 02:12:57,860
Maybe they're right.
Maybe they're right.

2887
02:12:58,340 --> 02:13:00,020
They might be right.
We don't know.

2888
02:13:00,021 --> 02:13:01,490
But it's juicy to think they're not 
right.

2889
02:13:01,580 --> 02:13:05,690
But it's interesting how rapidly people 
fight off the notion.

2890
02:13:05,720 --> 02:13:10,430
Here's the other weird shit about the 
Nazis were running our space program.

2891
02:13:10,730 --> 02:13:12,410
That's a fact.
Operation Paperclip,

2892
02:13:12,411 --> 02:13:13,244
Varun Navon promise a fucking Nazi.
They brought all the scientists over 

2893
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:16,993
like legit Nazis who would hang Jews in 
front of their fucking rocket factories 

2894
02:13:19,941 --> 02:13:22,250
in Berlin.
Git guys who were,

2895
02:13:22,340 --> 02:13:23,173
we're tattoos from the Holocaust,
identified Wernher von Braun talked 

2896
02:13:26,271 --> 02:13:28,610
about him being in there.
That was the head of NASA.

2897
02:13:28,640 --> 02:13:30,200
That was the guy who was trying to get 
us to the moon.

2898
02:13:30,380 --> 02:13:31,320
Yeah,
dude,

2899
02:13:31,321 --> 02:13:32,010
there's a lot of

2900
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:34,470
weird shit and now you're getting deep

2901
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:35,353
bend to it.
It's the Nazis doing some kind of thing 

2902
02:13:38,061 --> 02:13:38,894
where they're like trying to fake the 
moon landing like at some out get to 

2903
02:13:41,301 --> 02:13:42,800
attach to the Nazis.

2904
02:13:42,900 --> 02:13:47,340
I think the Nazis were the best rocket 
scientists available.

2905
02:13:47,460 --> 02:13:48,293
Right.
Or one of them other than the ones that 

2906
02:13:49,261 --> 02:13:50,820
we had here and then the ones the 
Russians had,

2907
02:13:50,821 --> 02:13:51,654
there was a lot of competition to get 
the best rocket scientists but some of 

2908
02:13:53,761 --> 02:13:55,800
the best rocket scientists were in Nazi 
terms.

2909
02:13:55,801 --> 02:13:57,570
Sure.
So when Nazi Germany fell,

2910
02:13:57,960 --> 02:14:01,650
operation paperclip took place and in 
Operation Operation Paperclip,

2911
02:14:01,680 --> 02:14:06,420
they brought a number of Nazi scientists
from Germany secretly to America.

2912
02:14:06,421 --> 02:14:08,580
And one of them they put as a head of 
fucking NASA.

2913
02:14:09,050 --> 02:14:09,940
Yeah,
this is where the,

2914
02:14:09,941 --> 02:14:10,774
this is where it gets really cool.
Someone was explaining all this to me 

2915
02:14:12,381 --> 02:14:15,470
about how basically it's the thing is 
like,

2916
02:14:15,471 --> 02:14:16,304
okay,
you think in World War II that we just 

2917
02:14:18,531 --> 02:14:22,100
rounded up all the Nazis and they just 
disappeared.

2918
02:14:22,430 --> 02:14:25,220
And it's like,
what do you think are the Nazis went and

2919
02:14:25,250 --> 02:14:26,083
they bought the ones who were really 
good at making cool shit yet we'll bear 

2920
02:14:28,941 --> 02:14:29,960
aspirin.
You know,

2921
02:14:29,961 --> 02:14:31,910
like the,
the idea is that the nar aspirin.

2922
02:14:32,030 --> 02:14:32,863
Yeah.
Well look up.

2923
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:33,713
I'm so sorry to ask Jamie,
but do you mind looking up bear as 

2924
02:14:35,631 --> 02:14:38,640
brandon psych on be like and,
and,

2925
02:14:38,650 --> 02:14:40,160
and,
and the Jewish slaves?

2926
02:14:40,220 --> 02:14:41,053
I think working for bare aspirin,
but when you look at like a lot of the 

2927
02:14:43,311 --> 02:14:45,830
core,
the idea is that the Nazis didn't really

2928
02:14:45,831 --> 02:14:46,664
go anywhere.
They just started corporations and some 

2929
02:14:49,041 --> 02:14:50,930
of the biggest corporations we have 
right now.

2930
02:14:50,931 --> 02:14:51,220
Or

2931
02:14:51,220 --> 02:14:52,053
do you know why Zyklon B is I clumby 
because icon beat took the smell out of 

2932
02:14:55,751 --> 02:14:58,300
it is I climb a,
was the stuff that had a sea,

2933
02:14:58,360 --> 02:15:01,510
an agent in it that made it smelled 
terrible so you could smell.

2934
02:15:02,200 --> 02:15:05,800
So when they used it to gas,
the people in the concentration camps,

2935
02:15:06,190 --> 02:15:09,100
they changed it so that it was a 
undetectable.

2936
02:15:09,970 --> 02:15:10,491
Yeah.
Did,

2937
02:15:10,491 --> 02:15:11,230
did you,
what would it say?

2938
02:15:11,230 --> 02:15:12,063
What does it say?
Jamie is quick with the trigger here 

2939
02:15:13,121 --> 02:15:13,954
today,
getting frustrated with us changes the 

2940
02:15:15,341 --> 02:15:16,174
camera.
So if you guys aren't the Bayer Aspirin 

2941
02:15:17,561 --> 02:15:18,394
company is finally apologize for the 
inhumane acts of its parent from 

2942
02:15:21,491 --> 02:15:24,790
including using Jewish slave laborers 
during the Holocaust.

2943
02:15:24,791 --> 02:15:26,380
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

2944
02:15:26,990 --> 02:15:27,600
Yeah.

2945
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:28,433
And there's all kinds of examples of 
this and where it gets really weird is 

2946
02:15:31,301 --> 02:15:32,134
like this is,
this is one of the great conspiracy 

2947
02:15:33,701 --> 02:15:36,680
theories is I think the Bush family is 
somehow wrapped up in it.

2948
02:15:37,180 --> 02:15:38,740
That's where it gets weird.
It's like the,

2949
02:15:38,920 --> 02:15:41,350
it ends up getting wrapped into American
politics.

2950
02:15:41,351 --> 02:15:42,131
It's like,
Oh,

2951
02:15:42,131 --> 02:15:45,550
do you think that the Nazis just became 
rocket scientists?

2952
02:15:45,551 --> 02:15:48,970
Do you think they just know they became 
pharmacists,

2953
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:53,560
pharmacists and they started running the
companies and corporations and then like

2954
02:15:53,830 --> 02:15:54,663
they,
and they're still here and their 

2955
02:15:55,991 --> 02:15:56,824
descendants have lots of money and like 
to think that they went anywhere is 

2956
02:16:00,281 --> 02:16:02,320
nuts.
The Nazis didn't really go anywhere.

2957
02:16:02,530 --> 02:16:03,363
They just went deep into hiding.
They just sink back into the immune 

2958
02:16:06,431 --> 02:16:09,640
system of society.
Like you know like the way aids hides in

2959
02:16:09,641 --> 02:16:13,630
different parts of your body.
They just hid in the shadows.

2960
02:16:13,631 --> 02:16:14,464
And this is one of the reasons people 
are freaking out about the kind of like 

2961
02:16:17,590 --> 02:16:18,423
um,
friendly emergence of some people who 

2962
02:16:20,891 --> 02:16:21,724
are like clearly white nationalists who 
are just kind of like being like 

2963
02:16:25,150 --> 02:16:27,850
interestingly accepted and embraced for,
you know,

2964
02:16:27,851 --> 02:16:29,950
what's at least have a rational about

2965
02:16:30,250 --> 02:16:32,320
how you want to start a white ethno 
state.

2966
02:16:32,350 --> 02:16:34,180
You know,
that kind of stuff because it,

2967
02:16:34,181 --> 02:16:35,410
who's doing that?
Well,

2968
02:16:35,411 --> 02:16:36,244
I mean,
isn't this something Richard Spencer 

2969
02:16:36,911 --> 02:16:39,370
talks about it,
but who's taking that guy and talking to

2970
02:16:39,371 --> 02:16:40,210
them rationally?
Well,

2971
02:16:40,211 --> 02:16:42,700
there's these,
a lot of these people are getting like a

2972
02:16:42,701 --> 02:16:43,534
lot of airtime,
but I think this is a bit of an 

2973
02:16:45,251 --> 02:16:45,941
exaggeration.
You're like,

2974
02:16:45,941 --> 02:16:46,774
maybe we're talking about Steve Bannon.
Steve Bannon got into the White House 

2975
02:16:48,491 --> 02:16:50,350
and a lot of people state their name is,
but he has,

2976
02:16:50,351 --> 02:16:51,550
he,
has it been proven,

2977
02:16:51,610 --> 02:16:54,280
I mean it's really easy to call a guy 
and a white nationalists.

2978
02:16:54,520 --> 02:16:56,490
Has it been proven?
I don't know much about Steve Bannon.

2979
02:16:56,520 --> 02:16:57,353
I don't know what,
honestly,

2980
02:16:57,610 --> 02:16:58,630
I think a lot of,
I think,

2981
02:16:58,660 --> 02:17:00,000
I think some of these people,
it's,

2982
02:17:00,010 --> 02:17:01,270
I think it's like God,
I mean,

2983
02:17:01,271 --> 02:17:03,280
you're going,
I'm going to get like a fucking,

2984
02:17:03,730 --> 02:17:07,690
I'm going to get like an avalanche of 
like you're a fucking guy,

2985
02:17:08,710 --> 02:17:10,090
tuck,
Tuck Kami.

2986
02:17:10,150 --> 02:17:10,983
But I think like for example,
when you look at trump's reaction when 

2987
02:17:13,031 --> 02:17:15,910
they were saying asking about the KKK 
and he's like,

2988
02:17:15,911 --> 02:17:17,410
I'm not going to talk shit about this 
group.

2989
02:17:17,411 --> 02:17:19,320
I don't really know him.
Remember that like,

2990
02:17:19,480 --> 02:17:21,900
or the fact that a lot of like,
I think you're paraphrasing.

2991
02:17:21,980 --> 02:17:22,720
Um,
he,

2992
02:17:22,720 --> 02:17:24,150
I think what he said was,
uh,

2993
02:17:24,310 --> 02:17:27,190
a little more acceptable but still 
weird.

2994
02:17:27,191 --> 02:17:29,350
Can we look at it?
It's like a little tip telling.

2995
02:17:29,351 --> 02:17:31,190
It's like if someone's like,
Hey Kay,

2996
02:17:31,191 --> 02:17:32,410
Kay Kay,
what do you think?

2997
02:17:32,440 --> 02:17:34,810
Well,
he's also said something about there was

2998
02:17:35,020 --> 02:17:37,900
people bad behavior on all sides,
on all sides.

2999
02:17:38,020 --> 02:17:38,853
And that's one of the,
one of the white nationalist groups 

3000
02:17:40,241 --> 02:17:41,074
picked up on that and said specifically 
that trump didn't criticize them 

3001
02:17:45,041 --> 02:17:47,050
specifically.
So this was a good thing.

3002
02:17:47,080 --> 02:17:47,913
The whole thing was very good for them.
It's like a white nationalist groups 

3003
02:17:50,151 --> 02:17:50,984
said that,
but that could have been just him just 

3004
02:17:54,461 --> 02:17:57,310
not doing a good job preparing.

3005
02:17:57,340 --> 02:17:59,440
What are you going to say about 
something and talking off the cuff,

3006
02:17:59,441 --> 02:18:00,274
which I think he does with most things.
I think that guy does most of his shit 

3007
02:18:03,071 --> 02:18:04,450
off the cuff.
Yeah,

3008
02:18:04,480 --> 02:18:04,781
he,
you know,

3009
02:18:04,781 --> 02:18:06,700
he said that and one of the things that 
he said,

3010
02:18:06,701 --> 02:18:08,620
but in the wrote that book,
the art of the deal,

3011
02:18:08,710 --> 02:18:10,840
he doesn't make plans.
He just goes,

3012
02:18:10,930 --> 02:18:13,210
it just goes to work and gets things 
done and just work.

3013
02:18:13,560 --> 02:18:14,740
Work off of instincts.
I don't know.

3014
02:18:15,010 --> 02:18:15,843
The thing is like,
it's generally like when you think of 

3015
02:18:17,321 --> 02:18:18,610
certain people,
right?

3016
02:18:18,790 --> 02:18:22,630
Are they a white nationalist?
Like when I think of you Joe,

3017
02:18:22,631 --> 02:18:24,520
are you a white nationalist?
No.

3018
02:18:24,910 --> 02:18:26,920
Right.
It's simple.

3019
02:18:26,921 --> 02:18:28,720
It's simple.
It's like there's no like,

3020
02:18:28,840 --> 02:18:30,430
well you know what?
Even a nationalist,

3021
02:18:30,790 --> 02:18:32,740
I love America,
but I'm not a nationalist.

3022
02:18:32,770 --> 02:18:34,180
Exactly.
Yeah.

3023
02:18:34,300 --> 02:18:37,900
So the problem is with some white what 
you don't want.

3024
02:18:37,950 --> 02:18:42,640
This is one thing I don't want,
I don't want there to be a blurry thing.

3025
02:18:42,641 --> 02:18:45,560
When people think of me about whether or
not I'm a white nationalist,

3026
02:18:45,850 --> 02:18:47,710
you know what I mean?
Like I don't want there to be a like,

3027
02:18:47,860 --> 02:18:48,693
well maybe he does have some kind of 
ideas that are based around the 

3028
02:18:52,361 --> 02:18:56,530
importance of upholding European culture
and making sure that we do everything we

3029
02:18:56,531 --> 02:19:01,270
can to prevent people from having sex 
with people from other races.

3030
02:19:01,450 --> 02:19:02,283
I don't want there to be any question,
but like I have zero problem with 

3031
02:19:08,230 --> 02:19:09,063
everyone humping everybody whenever they
want mixing the Paints and doing 

3032
02:19:13,331 --> 02:19:14,880
whatever.
There is no question.

3033
02:19:14,920 --> 02:19:17,800
I don't care.
Like I think it's fine.

3034
02:19:17,920 --> 02:19:19,720
Whereas some sounds like what a racist 
would say.

3035
02:19:19,870 --> 02:19:20,703
What do you mean?
Trying to like divert attention away 

3036
02:19:22,061 --> 02:19:23,500
from your racism.
I said,

3037
02:19:23,501 --> 02:19:25,540
what the fuck you're doing?
I see what you're doing,

3038
02:19:25,541 --> 02:19:27,650
man.
This is virtue signaling but virtue.

3039
02:19:27,750 --> 02:19:28,460
Oh,

3040
02:19:28,460 --> 02:19:30,110
do me a favor.
I hate to dwell on this one more time,

3041
02:19:30,111 --> 02:19:30,944
but you please go.
I want to make sure I'm right about 

3042
02:19:31,701 --> 02:19:32,534
this,
that the hassle bad cameras from the 

3043
02:19:33,831 --> 02:19:35,930
moon landing weren't insulated in any 
bizarre way.

3044
02:19:36,430 --> 02:19:39,380
See that up there are set.
They were different cameras.

3045
02:19:39,381 --> 02:19:42,050
They were mates a specialty while they 
were made for this chest thing.

3046
02:19:42,100 --> 02:19:42,933
They also had a special special film 
developed developed by Kodak Special 

3047
02:19:48,020 --> 02:19:48,531
Film.
Is that true?

3048
02:19:48,531 --> 02:19:50,240
Because I read that it was exact same 
film.

3049
02:19:50,890 --> 02:19:53,420
Who but who says it?
Who says it has a big breakdown?

3050
02:19:53,421 --> 02:19:54,710
I'd look it up.
It had a pixel,

3051
02:19:54,711 --> 02:19:55,544
which is a big cause too many fucking,
there's too many different people 

3052
02:19:58,041 --> 02:20:00,380
commenting on it that like,
like me,

3053
02:20:00,470 --> 02:20:01,303
like I'm muddying the waters myself by 
not exactly knowing what the fuck I'm 

3054
02:20:03,861 --> 02:20:04,910
talking about.
Well Dude,

3055
02:20:04,911 --> 02:20:05,744
I mean that's,
I look at the camera or behind the 

3056
02:20:07,400 --> 02:20:08,780
historic w what is this?

3057
02:20:08,960 --> 02:20:10,010
Who wrote this?
Had a pixel.

3058
02:20:10,011 --> 02:20:12,830
This is a pretty well,
this is fucking shell to shell site.

3059
02:20:12,831 --> 02:20:15,800
This is CIA front.
Even the shadows,

3060
02:20:15,801 --> 02:20:17,390
the lighting,
the lighting.

3061
02:20:17,391 --> 02:20:19,670
Why is it so well lit?
It's in the shadows.

3062
02:20:19,830 --> 02:20:20,663
God dammit.
There's a guy behind it with one of 

3063
02:20:21,501 --> 02:20:25,640
those big reflector booms.
This is on in Nevada.

3064
02:20:25,820 --> 02:20:28,580
There's a tarp back there.
And uh,

3065
02:20:28,581 --> 02:20:29,900
if you look real close,
you could,

3066
02:20:29,901 --> 02:20:31,370
uh,
see gum wrappers,

3067
02:20:31,371 --> 02:20:32,000
films,
listen,

3068
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,250
look at all that gum wrapper and fake 
round.

3069
02:20:34,340 --> 02:20:36,470
We've got fake that ground looks,
oh no man,

3070
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:37,910
look at that.
Look at it.

3071
02:20:37,911 --> 02:20:40,650
Shitty tin foil on that spaceship.
Yeah,

3072
02:20:40,651 --> 02:20:42,710
super likely.
That just landed on the moon.

3073
02:20:43,430 --> 02:20:46,280
It's just more fun.
This is why I abandoned the idea that we

3074
02:20:46,281 --> 02:20:49,340
didn't go to the moon.
It's more fun to think that we didn't go

3075
02:20:49,341 --> 02:20:50,870
to the moon.
It's more exciting.

3076
02:20:50,990 --> 02:20:53,570
So I have to be careful going that way.

3077
02:20:53,900 --> 02:20:56,150
That's why I changed my opinion on it 
because then I started really looking at

3078
02:20:56,151 --> 02:20:56,984
him like,
what the fuck do you know about space 

3079
02:20:58,221 --> 02:20:59,600
travel?
Almost zero.

3080
02:20:59,720 --> 02:21:01,820
But what do you know about bullshit?
I know I'm the law.

3081
02:21:01,880 --> 02:21:03,950
I'm good at bullshit.
I know about bullshit.

3082
02:21:04,160 --> 02:21:05,450
And when I watched that press 
conference,

3083
02:21:05,451 --> 02:21:07,730
the Post Apollo 11 press conference of 
Mike's Samoans,

3084
02:21:07,731 --> 02:21:10,310
but bullshit shit,
something's weird here.

3085
02:21:10,640 --> 02:21:15,170
And I think it's entirely possible that 
they were forced into,

3086
02:21:15,200 --> 02:21:16,033
uh,
accepting some stuff that wasn't real 

3087
02:21:18,171 --> 02:21:19,004
in,
they kind of knew it,

3088
02:21:19,430 --> 02:21:21,140
but that they probably did go to the 
moon.

3089
02:21:21,220 --> 02:21:22,053
I probably don't understand how you're,
this is like get back and forth in your 

3090
02:21:24,921 --> 02:21:25,754
head.
When I say alien artifacts on the moon 

3091
02:21:27,231 --> 02:21:27,890
right away,
you're like,

3092
02:21:27,890 --> 02:21:29,690
no,
I don't think they leave shit behind.

3093
02:21:29,720 --> 02:21:31,100
I think if they're smart,
they uh,

3094
02:21:31,101 --> 02:21:31,934
they clean up.
Have you not seen the clean up fucking 

3095
02:21:36,730 --> 02:21:37,563
rack?

3096
02:21:37,810 --> 02:21:38,643
There's a division of alien.
No evidence they'll look the face on 

3097
02:21:40,461 --> 02:21:42,440
Mars.
We've looked at women really well.

3098
02:21:42,860 --> 02:21:45,380
Picture of that space ship that crashed 
on the moon.

3099
02:21:45,440 --> 02:21:46,600
Oh yeah,
that's true.

3100
02:21:46,670 --> 02:21:48,470
That shit looks crazy.
Of a real,

3101
02:21:48,750 --> 02:21:50,930
I like to think that you space ships.
I think they get to a certain point,

3102
02:21:50,931 --> 02:21:52,850
they just traveled through dimensions.
I really do.

3103
02:21:53,080 --> 02:21:53,913
But think of that more and more.
I don't think spaceships exist other 

3104
02:21:55,941 --> 02:21:59,720
than like the really crude civilizations
like are relatively,

3105
02:21:59,960 --> 02:22:00,793
oh,
that's super real.

3106
02:22:00,890 --> 02:22:04,340
Which one do you mean it's most drawn 
with crayons?

3107
02:22:05,840 --> 02:22:07,220
What the fuck is that?
It's roaming.

3108
02:22:07,221 --> 02:22:08,620
That's an episode of Star Trek,
Bro.

3109
02:22:08,670 --> 02:22:09,503
That looks like a ship,
like the eyes of a mountain line behind 

3110
02:22:11,751 --> 02:22:12,351
it.
Come on,

3111
02:22:12,351 --> 02:22:13,184
man.
The eyes look at this is a fucking 

3112
02:22:15,021 --> 02:22:15,854
volcano.
Look,

3113
02:22:17,490 --> 02:22:19,790
look,
that's a fucking topographical map.

3114
02:22:19,910 --> 02:22:24,020
That's you're isolating a tiny little 
area and you're choosing to look at it.

3115
02:22:24,020 --> 02:22:25,500
You got to ship.
How dare you.

3116
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:26,513
You could look at anything in Moab,
Utah and decided that that's a space 

3117
02:22:28,881 --> 02:22:32,280
ship.
This is why they don't want to go to the

3118
02:22:32,281 --> 02:22:34,500
middle ground.
It's the fucking ground.

3119
02:22:34,501 --> 02:22:36,180
There's a hole in the ground that's a 
ship.

3120
02:22:36,210 --> 02:22:38,340
It's not a ship.
And look at that trail.

3121
02:22:38,341 --> 02:22:41,490
It's like a bobsled trail.
You know what's interesting?

3122
02:22:41,640 --> 02:22:45,480
We look for Shit on the moon or in space
in general,

3123
02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:48,780
and a normal thing in space is fucking 
amazing.

3124
02:22:48,781 --> 02:22:51,990
Like if we find a microbe on the desert 
floor,

3125
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,180
no one gives a shit.
Oh look,

3126
02:22:53,181 --> 02:22:55,140
your lives in the sand,
it's incredible.

3127
02:22:55,230 --> 02:22:56,063
Nobody's going to pay attention.
But if you find something in space and 

3128
02:22:58,171 --> 02:23:01,590
you can prove that this thing exists,
it was a living organism,

3129
02:23:01,770 --> 02:23:02,603
a primitive organism that's on Mars.
So we know that some life existed on 

3130
02:23:05,881 --> 02:23:06,960
Mars.
Right.

3131
02:23:07,260 --> 02:23:08,093
And then take it another step further.
If you ran into some dude who was 

3132
02:23:10,651 --> 02:23:11,484
jerking off in your apartment building,
you just open the open the wrong door 

3133
02:23:14,551 --> 02:23:17,130
and some dudes in there jerking off and 
he's screaming and he's an old man.

3134
02:23:17,131 --> 02:23:20,220
He's got a tank top on.
What the fuck can you tell your friends?

3135
02:23:20,221 --> 02:23:23,580
We'd laugh at it,
but if you found that guy on the moon to

3136
02:23:23,581 --> 02:23:27,960
some old Dude Jurgen off on the moon,
imagine if that's what we found.

3137
02:23:28,060 --> 02:23:29,670
I went to anyway,
go crazy.

3138
02:23:29,700 --> 02:23:30,533
Realize you realize like like that.
We literally are in a simulation and 

3139
02:23:33,301 --> 02:23:34,134
this is how we find out.
There's a guy on the moon jacking off 

3140
02:23:36,030 --> 02:23:40,350
and he's got boxer shorts on and socks 
with crocs and he's just sitting there.

3141
02:23:40,560 --> 02:23:41,940
He's probably knuckles up,
right?

3142
02:23:42,120 --> 02:23:42,953
He's sitting there with a hunchback 
knuckling up on the moon and he got 

3143
02:23:46,271 --> 02:23:48,510
dirt,
but he's got mouthfuls a dirt.

3144
02:23:48,510 --> 02:23:51,060
That's how he gets by.
That's the creator of the universe.

3145
02:23:51,061 --> 02:23:54,000
He's just gone crazy.
The creator of the universe went insane.

3146
02:23:54,180 --> 02:23:56,240
Now he just jerks off on the moon.
Oh,

3147
02:23:56,250 --> 02:23:58,130
it's an old man.
He looks just like an old man.

3148
02:23:58,131 --> 02:24:00,420
She was like,
the universe is so infinite.

3149
02:24:00,630 --> 02:24:03,840
There's an infinite number of 
possibilities that lives can exist.

3150
02:24:03,841 --> 02:24:05,280
Like someone's explaining this the other
day,

3151
02:24:05,490 --> 02:24:10,380
that the infinite is so vast that 
literally it's entirely possible.

3152
02:24:10,381 --> 02:24:11,214
There is a darth vader somewhere like a 
real legit darth vader who runs an 

3153
02:24:14,311 --> 02:24:16,260
empire.
Like it's real thing somewhere.

3154
02:24:16,350 --> 02:24:19,320
That's how many possibilities exist.
So if that's the case,

3155
02:24:19,530 --> 02:24:23,040
why can't there be a possibility on the 
moon of an old dude who eats dirt?

3156
02:24:23,240 --> 02:24:25,470
He's got a tank top and spaghetti stains
on it.

3157
02:24:25,471 --> 02:24:27,880
He's knuckling up on the moon.
Nah,

3158
02:24:28,030 --> 02:24:29,340
Nah.
We find them.

3159
02:24:29,341 --> 02:24:31,620
We have to film them front page of the 
New York Times.

3160
02:24:31,621 --> 02:24:33,300
They found an old manager and off of the
moon.

3161
02:24:33,510 --> 02:24:36,420
Do you think they tell us if they found 
an old man jerking off in the moon?

3162
02:24:36,421 --> 02:24:37,254
It's like that's what they find.
Like the space probe lands and then 

3163
02:24:39,541 --> 02:24:43,080
right in front of it's like fucking look
at this guy's great ball hair.

3164
02:24:43,120 --> 02:24:47,130
He's,
I'd love see this left press conference,

3165
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:51,920
half his guts hanging out,
spaghetti stains all.

3166
02:24:51,930 --> 02:24:53,940
How do you give it spaghetti stains on 
his shirt and no one knows.

3167
02:24:53,941 --> 02:24:57,300
No one knows he's eaten dirt on the moon
jerking off on the probes.

3168
02:24:57,301 --> 02:24:58,260
Now what?
Now?

3169
02:24:58,261 --> 02:25:00,780
What are you going to do now?
What is our civilization to,

3170
02:25:00,781 --> 02:25:02,130
how do we deal with this?
Well,

3171
02:25:02,131 --> 02:25:05,100
it's the same thing.
It's like this a elon musk car in space.

3172
02:25:05,101 --> 02:25:08,490
It's like you see the image of that car 
flying through sprint.

3173
02:25:08,491 --> 02:25:09,091
You're like,
wait a minute,

3174
02:25:09,091 --> 02:25:09,591
wait a minute,
wait,

3175
02:25:09,591 --> 02:25:12,070
is this real?
Is this really going on or am I in it?

3176
02:25:12,100 --> 02:25:13,180
Goddamn movie,
right?

3177
02:25:13,230 --> 02:25:14,063
Like what's happening here?
It's just got to really spend $100 

3178
02:25:15,690 --> 02:25:18,510
million a shoot a car and it space.
What the fuck is this?

3179
02:25:18,540 --> 02:25:20,060
Sure,
he's got a camera on it.

3180
02:25:20,090 --> 02:25:24,010
It's broadcasting images of a mannequin.
Find what the fuck is going

3181
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:24,610
on,
man.

3182
02:25:24,610 --> 02:25:27,220
Cascading levels of absurdity.
That's what's happening.

3183
02:25:27,221 --> 02:25:31,200
We're seeing cascading levels of 
absurdity and like the more that it,

3184
02:25:31,360 --> 02:25:34,660
the more that absurdity happens,
the more normal it seems.

3185
02:25:34,700 --> 02:25:36,040
Yeah.
And that's kind of I,

3186
02:25:36,041 --> 02:25:38,620
this is what I've been thinking is like 
what,

3187
02:25:38,650 --> 02:25:39,483
what the apocalypse really looks like 
because everybody thinks when you think 

3188
02:25:42,281 --> 02:25:45,010
about the apocalypse,
when I think about the apocalypse,

3189
02:25:45,820 --> 02:25:47,290
I think of media,
yours,

3190
02:25:47,860 --> 02:25:49,510
volcanoes,
the classics,

3191
02:25:49,540 --> 02:25:53,590
you know the ocean dying of like just 
cataclysms right,

3192
02:25:53,650 --> 02:25:57,820
right.
But really it's like more like absurdity

3193
02:25:57,821 --> 02:25:58,654
starts avalanching into time to the 
point where things start happening so 

3194
02:26:03,311 --> 02:26:04,144
quickly that we can't even catch up.
Like now we gotta deal with the fact 

3195
02:26:07,091 --> 02:26:10,450
there's a fucking tesla infinitely 
flying through space.

3196
02:26:10,730 --> 02:26:13,270
If it slams into a spaceship that's 
coming to visit us,

3197
02:26:15,400 --> 02:26:16,233
fucking a man.
Could you imagine it was like the alien 

3198
02:26:20,851 --> 02:26:23,250
overlord.
So like they're finally ready,

3199
02:26:23,310 --> 02:26:24,143
let us visit and they come in at light 
speed and then the moment they read 

3200
02:26:28,201 --> 02:26:31,950
merged from lightspeed,
Tesla comes through the windshield,

3201
02:26:31,951 --> 02:26:32,784
hits him right in the face,
takes the head off the emperor and it's 

3202
02:26:35,430 --> 02:26:37,920
just fucked.
Just explosions.

3203
02:26:37,921 --> 02:26:39,390
Just like in Star Wars.
Boom,

3204
02:26:39,420 --> 02:26:40,650
boom,
boom.

3205
02:26:40,800 --> 02:26:45,000
Laura dern is at the wheel holding on or
turn around.

3206
02:26:45,330 --> 02:26:47,340
That's what happened in the new star 
wars movie.

3207
02:26:47,341 --> 02:26:49,770
Spoiler alert.
Remember when they hit warp speed,

3208
02:26:49,771 --> 02:26:51,810
they went right through that one jet or 
that one.

3209
02:26:52,270 --> 02:26:53,010
Yeah,
that's,

3210
02:26:53,010 --> 02:26:54,270
that's probably going to happen,
dude.

3211
02:26:54,271 --> 02:26:57,910
Or it hits a meaty or it hits a 
meteorite that wasn't going to hit earth

3212
02:26:57,930 --> 02:27:00,810
and then knocked the trajectory so that 
it does.

3213
02:27:01,310 --> 02:27:03,180
Yeah.
I think,

3214
02:27:03,420 --> 02:27:04,110
yeah,
there's,

3215
02:27:04,110 --> 02:27:04,943
there is now.
Elon musk kills us all when this stupid 

3216
02:27:07,201 --> 02:27:10,500
fucking car flying through space.
She has his fucking car out.

3217
02:27:10,501 --> 02:27:13,720
Just grazes and asteroid clink and it 
just,

3218
02:27:14,910 --> 02:27:15,743
yeah,

3219
02:27:17,140 --> 02:27:18,130
right towards La.

3220
02:27:18,210 --> 02:27:19,620
Yeah.
We don't know,

3221
02:27:19,621 --> 02:27:20,454
man.
It hits the laugh factory that's been 

3222
02:27:23,580 --> 02:27:25,590
the center.
That's the fucking main place.

3223
02:27:25,591 --> 02:27:27,930
It smashes.
Make God laugh.

3224
02:27:28,270 --> 02:27:29,103
Yeah.
It's two side of 18 semis and it hits 

3225
02:27:32,851 --> 02:27:33,690
the laugh factory.

3226
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,090
No one can hear.
No one can hear it,

3227
02:27:39,100 --> 02:27:42,370
so it's so loud.
Everyone's ears explode,

3228
02:27:42,460 --> 02:27:43,180
please.
No.

3229
02:27:43,180 --> 02:27:45,450
If you're nowhere near it,
your ears explode.

3230
02:27:45,460 --> 02:27:46,293
If you in Kansas,
if your ears explode from the impact 

3231
02:27:49,240 --> 02:27:51,130
you're never hearing ever again.
Ever.

3232
02:27:51,190 --> 02:27:52,260
No one within up

3233
02:27:52,570 --> 02:27:53,970
5,000

3234
02:27:53,970 --> 02:27:55,920
mile radius ever hears again.

3235
02:27:59,240 --> 02:28:00,860
People in The Bahamas,
like what?

3236
02:28:01,790 --> 02:28:04,580
What?
What was that?

3237
02:28:05,120 --> 02:28:07,010
Yeah.
Yeah.

3238
02:28:08,420 --> 02:28:09,340
That's crazy.
Hey Z,

3239
02:28:09,800 --> 02:28:14,420
the earth rings for a million years.
That's fucking crazy.

3240
02:28:14,450 --> 02:28:15,283
They sent,
when the earth got hit by that one that 

3241
02:28:16,671 --> 02:28:17,504
hit the Yucatan 65 million years ago,
it rang for a million years just to 

3242
02:28:22,431 --> 02:28:27,320
drown.
Just like it got cracked like a gong for

3243
02:28:27,321 --> 02:28:31,910
a million years do.
That's fucking crazy.

3244
02:28:32,030 --> 02:28:32,863
You ever heard the descriptions of how 
deep they think that thing was in the 

3245
02:28:35,991 --> 02:28:39,140
earth within the first second of impact?
No.

3246
02:28:39,620 --> 02:28:40,453
It's something bananas like a miles deep
into the earth within the first second 

3247
02:28:44,451 --> 02:28:45,284
of impact.
That's how big that thing was called 

3248
02:28:47,991 --> 02:28:49,940
Manhattan size chunk.

3249
02:28:51,140 --> 02:28:51,771
Yeah,
man.

3250
02:28:51,771 --> 02:28:54,800
I love that because that's reality.
Isn't that funny?

3251
02:28:54,920 --> 02:28:55,753
That's the funny thing about existing on
the planet is because everybody walks 

3252
02:28:58,701 --> 02:29:03,701
around imagining that the world that 
we're living in is permanent,

3253
02:29:03,890 --> 02:29:07,100
permanent and stable and not just our 
world aren't just society,

3254
02:29:07,101 --> 02:29:07,934
but your own life.
Like people walk around through their 

3255
02:29:10,431 --> 02:29:11,264
own fucking life.
This is the thing I was thinking about 

3256
02:29:12,651 --> 02:29:13,730
that uh,
that terrible.

3257
02:29:13,920 --> 02:29:16,190
It keeps happening but the Amtrak train 
crash.

3258
02:29:16,191 --> 02:29:17,024
Yeah.
Cause it's like when you think about 

3259
02:29:18,441 --> 02:29:21,260
that you're just going to work.

3260
02:29:21,730 --> 02:29:22,563
Why do you use it?
Here's the thing that disturbed me the 

3261
02:29:23,471 --> 02:29:25,450
most,
and this disturbed me a lot lately.

3262
02:29:26,140 --> 02:29:31,140
This is a real issue.
People that were on the left were saying

3263
02:29:32,681 --> 02:29:33,514
that they were happy that it happened,
that God had done something to kill 

3264
02:29:37,121 --> 02:29:39,370
these politicians because there was a 
lot of right wing.

3265
02:29:39,400 --> 02:29:40,233
Oh yeah.
G O p people that were on his Amtrak 

3266
02:29:42,400 --> 02:29:45,010
thing.
Like could you imagine just saying that,

3267
02:29:45,011 --> 02:29:45,580
not,
not,

3268
02:29:45,580 --> 02:29:48,370
not only thinking it,
but saying it on twitter,

3269
02:29:48,520 --> 02:29:49,353
like you're so confident.
Show your righteous with your desire to 

3270
02:29:52,751 --> 02:29:56,830
have strangers dead in a horrible 
fucking train accident.

3271
02:29:57,200 --> 02:29:58,033
Yeah.
Like somebody died in that accident and 

3272
02:29:59,321 --> 02:30:00,450
they're like,
great.

3273
02:30:00,490 --> 02:30:03,240
Going to herb and someone's Dad's dead.
Yeah.

3274
02:30:03,380 --> 02:30:06,100
Right.
Someone's mom be of was a male or female

3275
02:30:06,101 --> 02:30:08,140
at died,
but someone's mom dead.

3276
02:30:08,410 --> 02:30:12,200
Someone's sister dead look good.
Good riddance them.

3277
02:30:12,460 --> 02:30:14,800
God had a plan for them.
Fuck down.

3278
02:30:15,250 --> 02:30:16,510
Like,
cause they're on the other team.

3279
02:30:16,990 --> 02:30:17,461
Yeah.
Dude,

3280
02:30:17,461 --> 02:30:20,680
that shit does terrifying.
That shit's really sad.

3281
02:30:20,710 --> 02:30:23,560
But it never used to be the left.
That's what's the scariest thing to me.

3282
02:30:23,920 --> 02:30:26,140
The left was never like advocating 
violence.

3283
02:30:26,141 --> 02:30:27,960
They were the exact opposite during the 
hit,

3284
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:29,380
the,
the Vietnam War,

3285
02:30:29,530 --> 02:30:30,363
they were the hippies.
They were the people that wanted to 

3286
02:30:31,451 --> 02:30:33,400
bring the troops home.
They're the people that didn't want war.

3287
02:30:33,401 --> 02:30:35,200
They didn't want violence.
They didn't want to hate.

3288
02:30:35,440 --> 02:30:37,540
They denounce tate.
Now they're,

3289
02:30:37,541 --> 02:30:38,374
they're like,
they're like talking about violence 

3290
02:30:41,051 --> 02:30:41,884
being the answer.
I see certain certain political 

3291
02:30:44,051 --> 02:30:46,170
movements.
I punch a Nazi.

3292
02:30:46,500 --> 02:30:51,060
I saw a term on reddit that I liked a 
lot called liberal baptist.

3293
02:30:51,061 --> 02:30:54,480
Have you heard of this?
So basically the idea is like a,

3294
02:30:55,170 --> 02:30:56,003
you know,
like in fundamentalism of any sort 

3295
02:30:58,410 --> 02:31:02,760
really.
Like the idea is when you're saying that

3296
02:31:02,761 --> 02:31:03,900
you're religious,
it's you're,

3297
02:31:03,901 --> 02:31:08,901
you're not really interested in another 
person's soul or saving another person.

3298
02:31:09,600 --> 02:31:10,433
What you're interested in doing is 
creating an ethical hierarchy that you 

3299
02:31:12,961 --> 02:31:15,900
can dominate by being at the top of the 
ethical hierarchy.

3300
02:31:15,901 --> 02:31:16,734
Right.
So what you're running into with this 

3301
02:31:19,320 --> 02:31:20,153
that you're talking about is people who 
don't really seem so concerned with how 

3302
02:31:25,111 --> 02:31:25,944
society is supposed to be as much as 
using their refined system that they've 

3303
02:31:32,041 --> 02:31:33,930
come up with,
which is like,

3304
02:31:33,960 --> 02:31:35,880
they call it being woke or,
you know what I mean?

3305
02:31:35,881 --> 02:31:36,750
It's like,
it's this rough,

3306
02:31:36,751 --> 02:31:38,520
crazy,
it's hard to even keep up with it,

3307
02:31:38,940 --> 02:31:39,773
but they use it to try to dominate the 
people around them by making you scared 

3308
02:31:43,801 --> 02:31:44,760
to speak your mind.

3309
02:31:44,980 --> 02:31:46,810
Because the idea is it's like,
you know,

3310
02:31:46,940 --> 02:31:47,773
like I,
one of Mike the guests on my podcast 

3311
02:31:49,741 --> 02:31:50,574
that I get fucking yelled at more than 
anybody else for having on Jordan 

3312
02:31:54,720 --> 02:31:55,553
Peterson that really pissed a lot of 
people after I had him on my podcast 

3313
02:31:59,550 --> 02:32:00,383
because they feel they misunderstand him
and they think that Jordan Peterson 

3314
02:32:04,740 --> 02:32:08,460
hates a transgendered people,
I think.

3315
02:32:08,461 --> 02:32:11,610
Or they think that he's a,
uh,

3316
02:32:11,611 --> 02:32:13,110
I think that he's,
they think that he's like,

3317
02:32:13,111 --> 02:32:13,944
all right,
they think that he's like some kind of 

3318
02:32:15,031 --> 02:32:19,350
outright spokesman.
And the truth of the matter is I don't,

3319
02:32:19,500 --> 02:32:20,333
I don't fully know all of Georgia,
the spectrum of Jordan Peterson's views 

3320
02:32:24,691 --> 02:32:27,240
on things because it would take me a 
very long time to do that.

3321
02:32:27,241 --> 02:32:28,074
I know he's fucking smart.
I know it was really cool for him to 

3322
02:32:30,331 --> 02:32:31,164
call my podcasts and I know we had a 
really great conversation that didn't 

3323
02:32:34,261 --> 02:32:35,094
really talk about that stuff,
but it didn't fit the narrative that 

3324
02:32:36,871 --> 02:32:37,704
they want.

3325
02:32:37,960 --> 02:32:38,793
The narrative that they want is that 
he's a hateful person and then he hates 

3326
02:32:41,401 --> 02:32:42,234
transgender people and that he's a bigot
and then he's just right wing outrights 

3327
02:32:45,720 --> 02:32:47,580
poster boy,
but it's not real.

3328
02:32:47,670 --> 02:32:48,503
The problem is people aren't willing to 
adjust that once they stand on that 

3329
02:32:50,401 --> 02:32:51,234
stance,
once they have that position that this 

3330
02:32:53,191 --> 02:32:54,024
is,
I'm left disguise right way and he's a 

3331
02:32:55,021 --> 02:32:56,940
pig,
he's ruining things like that.

3332
02:32:56,970 --> 02:32:58,280
They just make up their mind.
But can it,

3333
02:32:58,281 --> 02:33:00,330
can we throw it,
let me add one thing to this.

3334
02:33:00,750 --> 02:33:01,583
Imagine this.
Imagine Jordan Peterson and I don't 

3335
02:33:04,320 --> 02:33:05,700
honestly,
I don't know,

3336
02:33:05,730 --> 02:33:10,730
but just imagine there is a piece of him
that doesn't for whatever reason,

3337
02:33:11,310 --> 02:33:12,850
like it he,
I don't know.

3338
02:33:12,851 --> 02:33:13,381
I'm,
again,

3339
02:33:13,381 --> 02:33:16,560
I'm not saying this as an I have no,
I'm not implying it either.

3340
02:33:16,590 --> 02:33:18,900
I'm just saying imagine fucking short 
Jordan Peterson.

3341
02:33:19,110 --> 02:33:19,943
I don't know.
I'm trying to think of some offensive 

3342
02:33:23,100 --> 02:33:23,933
thing that he just imagined he had some 
piece of him that was definitely 

3343
02:33:29,010 --> 02:33:31,020
politically not correct.

3344
02:33:31,080 --> 02:33:31,930
Right,
okay.

3345
02:33:32,250 --> 02:33:33,083
That doesn't mean that all the other 
shitty saying is invalidated by some 

3346
02:33:37,861 --> 02:33:41,100
piece of him cause people are made up of
lots of different pieces.

3347
02:33:41,130 --> 02:33:45,270
Well that's basically in a way,
I'm not categorizing Jordan Peterson the

3348
02:33:45,271 --> 02:33:48,600
way you categorize descartes,
but that's what he was saying.

3349
02:33:48,840 --> 02:33:50,850
Right.
That with great people,

3350
02:33:50,910 --> 02:33:53,400
they all also have,
what was the word?

3351
02:33:53,401 --> 02:33:58,080
He used a not great sin but great.
What was the word?

3352
02:33:58,081 --> 02:34:00,570
He used to remember the word,
the expression.

3353
02:34:00,571 --> 02:34:03,030
He ain't got shit.
They've got shit gun shit.

3354
02:34:03,060 --> 02:34:05,130
Yeah,
the great flaws as well as,

3355
02:34:05,170 --> 02:34:06,080
and I this,
this,

3356
02:34:06,100 --> 02:34:07,740
this devices.
That's what he said.

3357
02:34:07,770 --> 02:34:10,830
This is to me where the big fucking 
problem is,

3358
02:34:10,831 --> 02:34:15,360
is that people have lost the ability to 
be nuanced and people if and,

3359
02:34:15,370 --> 02:34:18,730
and that to me is where things are 
really fucked up right now,

3360
02:34:18,731 --> 02:34:22,060
which is like you were throwing the baby
out with the bath water.

3361
02:34:22,330 --> 02:34:23,740
And I'm not saying like,
oh,

3362
02:34:23,741 --> 02:34:26,740
let's give a platform to people who have
like hate speech hate.

3363
02:34:26,741 --> 02:34:27,320
Yeah.
But,

3364
02:34:27,320 --> 02:34:28,153
but the idea that we have gotten to the 
point now where just like free balling 

3365
02:34:33,101 --> 02:34:33,934
and throwing around ideas,
just like we've done all over the place 

3366
02:34:36,581 --> 02:34:38,200
here,
I guarantee you when I look at twitter,

3367
02:34:38,470 --> 02:34:39,303
there's going to be at least like five 
people being like you fucking piece of 

3368
02:34:43,571 --> 02:34:44,404
shit.
Only because like I'm throwing around 

3369
02:34:45,791 --> 02:34:49,480
ideas because my hope is through that 
process,

3370
02:34:49,870 --> 02:34:50,703
I'm going to get closer to the truth and
I'm going to be able to look at myself 

3371
02:34:53,201 --> 02:34:56,200
like what you said about the cock,
the coke boy.

3372
02:34:56,710 --> 02:34:59,530
You know what I mean?
I liked it because you're right.

3373
02:34:59,740 --> 02:35:02,260
And I like what you did,
even though his comedic is funny.

3374
02:35:02,590 --> 02:35:03,550
You're right,
dude.

3375
02:35:03,580 --> 02:35:05,920
Why am I giving that guy a hard fucking 
tax you're going to do?

3376
02:35:05,920 --> 02:35:08,110
He can't not be born a cookson.
Right?

3377
02:35:08,140 --> 02:35:10,170
It's,
he's like you can't change his birth and

3378
02:35:10,171 --> 02:35:13,340
his who he is he doing?
So he taking over countries in Africa.

3379
02:35:13,341 --> 02:35:15,980
I know he's making cute shirts and he's 
banging a hot woman yet.

3380
02:35:16,250 --> 02:35:17,980
Hello.
I'd so that's to that.

3381
02:35:17,981 --> 02:35:18,814
But I liked,
I liked that having these kinds of 

3382
02:35:20,231 --> 02:35:23,770
interactions with friends because it 
helps me adjust even though I don't have

3383
02:35:23,771 --> 02:35:27,010
any real animosity for the koch brother 
from that kind of thing.

3384
02:35:27,011 --> 02:35:28,870
I can look at my own fucking pattern and
be like,

3385
02:35:28,871 --> 02:35:29,740
whoa shit.
Yeah,

3386
02:35:29,741 --> 02:35:30,574
that's like a,
that's something to think about cause I 

3387
02:35:32,140 --> 02:35:33,580
like,
I could be more compassionate there.

3388
02:35:33,880 --> 02:35:36,040
So my point is what,
what,

3389
02:35:36,041 --> 02:35:36,874
what ends up happening and what leads to
someone who started off being 

3390
02:35:39,840 --> 02:35:40,673
[inaudible],
who's a,

3391
02:35:41,350 --> 02:35:43,150
who considers themselves part of a 
group.

3392
02:35:43,510 --> 02:35:45,550
There was true that's trying to stop 
war.

3393
02:35:45,850 --> 02:35:46,683
That spawned the hippie movement and now
they're like thankful that a train 

3394
02:35:50,471 --> 02:35:51,304
accident happened.
That is a result of gradually shutting 

3395
02:35:55,181 --> 02:36:00,181
down their ability to understand that a 
human is much more than just one fucking

3396
02:36:00,611 --> 02:36:01,444
thing.
Jeff sessions is not just an anti 

3397
02:36:03,941 --> 02:36:07,430
marijuana person.
Jeff sessions is probably an elephant,

3398
02:36:07,720 --> 02:36:08,553
an elephant as sweet at that and a 
person who's got a lot of love in him 

3399
02:36:12,130 --> 02:36:14,410
and he's done a lot of good things for a
lot of people,

3400
02:36:14,620 --> 02:36:15,453
but also he's got the worst fucking 
concept of what marijuana is and that 

3401
02:36:19,811 --> 02:36:20,644
sucks.
But that doesn't invalidate any of the 

3402
02:36:22,361 --> 02:36:23,194
love he's expressed throughout his life.
And this is unbearable for some people 

3403
02:36:26,771 --> 02:36:29,170
to deal with because we want a darth 
vader.

3404
02:36:29,230 --> 02:36:30,063
Well,
it's because we are inclined to 

3405
02:36:32,231 --> 02:36:35,920
gravitate towards tribalism.
It is a part of being human being.

3406
02:36:35,921 --> 02:36:37,120
It's always going to be a part.

3407
02:36:37,150 --> 02:36:40,870
It's the same reason why those 
egyptologists were rejecting these ideas

3408
02:36:40,871 --> 02:36:41,704
from John Anthony West.
Robert Schoch cause they weren't a part 

3409
02:36:43,031 --> 02:36:43,864
of the tribe and these new people coming
in with some shit that they didn't 

3410
02:36:46,571 --> 02:36:49,420
figure it out on their own.
There's a thing that people do on,

3411
02:36:49,540 --> 02:36:50,373
whether it's male versus female.
You're seeing a lot of this when it 

3412
02:36:52,661 --> 02:36:53,494
comes to this me too stuff.
One of the weirdest things that happens 

3413
02:36:55,720 --> 02:36:56,553
is that you start to getting this divide
where the men are men and the women and 

3414
02:36:59,021 --> 02:36:59,854
the women in the matter of the men.
Even people that are non offenders and 

3415
02:37:01,561 --> 02:37:05,500
and non victims.
They shore up on teams and yes,

3416
02:37:05,501 --> 02:37:09,040
it's good that people are being exposed 
for doing bad things to people,

3417
02:37:09,041 --> 02:37:09,874
but it's also very dangerous for us to 
just be men and women be on opposite 

3418
02:37:13,421 --> 02:37:14,530
teams.
We're humans,

3419
02:37:14,560 --> 02:37:16,320
right?
We're supposed to be nice to each other.

3420
02:37:16,320 --> 02:37:17,153
It's,
it goes back to what we were talking 

3421
02:37:17,601 --> 02:37:18,760
about earlier.
We,

3422
02:37:18,830 --> 02:37:22,040
we don't say that enough.
I really don't think we say it enough.

3423
02:37:22,041 --> 02:37:24,320
I really think we need to,
it needs,

3424
02:37:24,321 --> 02:37:25,970
it should be reinforced and it sounds 
like,

3425
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:27,440
oh,
it's a fucking growth thing.

3426
02:37:27,470 --> 02:37:28,460
That's your advice,
Bro.

3427
02:37:28,580 --> 02:37:30,380
Be Nice to each other.
Yes,

3428
02:37:30,470 --> 02:37:31,400
it is.
My advice.

3429
02:37:31,401 --> 02:37:32,234
It's not my only advice.
I think you should also get your shit 

3430
02:37:34,281 --> 02:37:35,114
together.
I think you should have some fucking 

3431
02:37:35,631 --> 02:37:37,310
discipline.
I think you should eat right.

3432
02:37:37,311 --> 02:37:39,070
I think she'd do a lot of things.
You should read books,

3433
02:37:39,110 --> 02:37:41,270
they should pay attention.
I think he's tried to educate yourself.

3434
02:37:41,360 --> 02:37:44,240
I think he's tried to be aware about 
objectivity and tribalism.

3435
02:37:44,400 --> 02:37:47,780
Where are the influence.
But I also think it would be really nice

3436
02:37:47,810 --> 02:37:48,643
if we all just agreed to be nicer to 
each other and just have it as a 

3437
02:37:51,531 --> 02:37:55,280
conversation that the country has and 
then ultimately the world has.

3438
02:37:55,310 --> 02:37:57,530
But that list of things you just gave 
before that.

3439
02:37:57,590 --> 02:37:58,423
Yeah,
I think that all fits into the category 

3440
02:37:59,901 --> 02:38:02,780
of being kind to yourself.
And I think that the way you're going to

3441
02:38:02,781 --> 02:38:03,614
learn to be nice to other people is by 
learning how to be kinder to yourself 

3442
02:38:06,861 --> 02:38:10,550
and being kind to yourself means 
treating your body better.

3443
02:38:10,551 --> 02:38:11,384
And that's loving yourself.
And like this is actually one of the 

3444
02:38:15,711 --> 02:38:18,740
things this Guy Jack Kornfield taught 
me,

3445
02:38:18,741 --> 02:38:20,450
which I like a lot cause I was talking 
to him about,

3446
02:38:20,451 --> 02:38:21,284
man,
you know I want to fucking get in shape 

3447
02:38:22,161 --> 02:38:24,290
and like I feel bad cause I want to be 
more in shape.

3448
02:38:24,800 --> 02:38:25,760
And he's like,
okay,

3449
02:38:26,060 --> 02:38:29,990
but the way you're talking about it,
you're hating yourself right now.

3450
02:38:30,010 --> 02:38:30,843
Yeah.
Don't get in shape because you hate who 

3451
02:38:32,631 --> 02:38:33,464
you are.
Get in shape because you love yourself 

3452
02:38:35,451 --> 02:38:37,770
enough to want to feel better and to 
what?

3453
02:38:37,990 --> 02:38:40,910
So saying that it changes the way I'm 
looking at it.

3454
02:38:40,940 --> 02:38:42,200
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?

3455
02:38:42,201 --> 02:38:43,880
Like you just saying that I'm like,
yeah,

3456
02:38:43,910 --> 02:38:44,840
all right.
Yeah,

3457
02:38:45,020 --> 02:38:49,220
don't hate your body loving by getting 
it healthy and then by loving you,

3458
02:38:49,250 --> 02:38:51,830
that's loving your site changes the 
intention around from like,

3459
02:38:51,831 --> 02:38:55,820
I'm going to destroy my fall myself and 
replace it with a better self.

3460
02:38:55,821 --> 02:38:59,510
It's like I'm going to love this being I
am right now and the way I'm going to do

3461
02:38:59,511 --> 02:39:00,950
that is by,
you know what?

3462
02:39:00,980 --> 02:39:03,980
I don't need to have five beers a night.
You know?

3463
02:39:04,020 --> 02:39:04,853
I don't need to pour the booze into the 
thing every night as much as I have 

3464
02:39:07,731 --> 02:39:08,564
been.
I don't need to smoke cigarettes or I 

3465
02:39:09,321 --> 02:39:12,740
don't eat whatever the thing is.
And that attitude of like,

3466
02:39:12,741 --> 02:39:16,250
I'm not doing this because I am not 
doing this because I hate myself.

3467
02:39:16,250 --> 02:39:18,060
It's just this is a different ways of me
too,

3468
02:39:18,410 --> 02:39:20,720
for me to express love into my own 
world.

3469
02:39:21,050 --> 02:39:23,180
And then from that it radiates out.
That's what you did.

3470
02:39:23,480 --> 02:39:27,050
I mean that's what you do is like part 
of what appeals I think.

3471
02:39:27,051 --> 02:39:27,884
And and you that appeals to people is 
that you're sort of radiating this like 

3472
02:39:33,830 --> 02:39:37,580
way of being that offers a lot of people
a sense of like,

3473
02:39:37,610 --> 02:39:39,140
oh shit,
I could probably do that.

3474
02:39:39,350 --> 02:39:42,230
I could probably do that.
And it draws people in.

3475
02:39:42,440 --> 02:39:45,050
So this kindness that you're talking 
about,

3476
02:39:45,410 --> 02:39:47,000
it's contagious.
Yes,

3477
02:39:47,030 --> 02:39:47,863
it is contagious and it should be,
and it's our cultures operate on the 

3478
02:39:52,821 --> 02:39:55,820
momentum of the people that are in them.
Right?

3479
02:39:55,850 --> 02:39:58,700
Nazi Germany is a good example.
So it was Denmark,

3480
02:39:58,760 --> 02:39:59,593
so it was Norway.
I mean it was really interesting 

3481
02:40:00,651 --> 02:40:02,600
cultures that are very different from 
other cultures.

3482
02:40:02,601 --> 02:40:03,434
China's very different from a Ethiopia.
I mean we vary widely in the way we 

3483
02:40:07,791 --> 02:40:11,750
behave and I think there's a bunch of 
different styles of being a person.

3484
02:40:11,960 --> 02:40:14,130
And I think the problem is,
and this is a problem

3485
02:40:14,130 --> 02:40:19,130
that I had as a young man,
I had an ultra competitive issue.

3486
02:40:19,710 --> 02:40:22,800
I was competitive with my friends,
I was competitive with other men.

3487
02:40:23,010 --> 02:40:23,843
I was competitive.
I would shit on people that I didn't 

3488
02:40:25,441 --> 02:40:26,940
know.
Look at this fucking loser,

3489
02:40:27,090 --> 02:40:29,940
you know,
like it's a natural thing that young men

3490
02:40:29,941 --> 02:40:30,774
go through.
And it took me until I was probably in 

3491
02:40:33,331 --> 02:40:35,940
my early twenties till I realized how 
toxic that was.

3492
02:40:36,210 --> 02:40:40,920
And I moved myself out of it and instead
started celebrating people around me.

3493
02:40:40,980 --> 02:40:45,960
I changed my vibe because I,
I was very flawed as a young men,

3494
02:40:45,961 --> 02:40:50,940
but also super hyper self critical.
So my hyper self critical,

3495
02:40:50,950 --> 02:40:53,310
I always wanted to be a better version 
of myself,

3496
02:40:53,730 --> 02:40:54,450
but,
and I would,

3497
02:40:54,450 --> 02:40:57,780
I wouldn't do it the right way.
Like it was Jack Cornfield's idea.

3498
02:40:57,930 --> 02:40:58,630
Who's,
who is it?

3499
02:40:58,630 --> 02:41:01,650
Cornfield Jack Cornfield's idea.
I didn't do it the right way.

3500
02:41:01,650 --> 02:41:02,483
I didn't do it his way.
I did it the way that a barely educated 

3501
02:41:06,630 --> 02:41:07,463
21 year old man who's mostly just read 
books on a combat sports and fighting 

3502
02:41:13,201 --> 02:41:14,034
philosophy in psychology.
I have a very limited amount of 

3503
02:41:16,141 --> 02:41:18,960
information in my head,
but I realized that there was some flaws

3504
02:41:18,961 --> 02:41:19,794
in the way I was thinking and I realized
I was spending all this energy getting 

3505
02:41:22,921 --> 02:41:23,754
mad at people that I didn't know,
hating people that had things that I 

3506
02:41:26,221 --> 02:41:29,370
didn't have and I really,
I was sitting around thinking about this

3507
02:41:29,371 --> 02:41:33,570
once and it was as I was becoming more 
successful as a martial artist,

3508
02:41:33,870 --> 02:41:34,703
I was realizing that one of the things 
that was holding me back before was my 

3509
02:41:36,661 --> 02:41:38,870
mind.
And it wasn't just my physical talent,

3510
02:41:38,880 --> 02:41:40,350
my skills,
which also got better,

3511
02:41:40,500 --> 02:41:41,333
but it was also that I had a better way 
of approaching competition that I had 

3512
02:41:44,101 --> 02:41:46,440
when I was younger because it didn't 
carry as much anxiety.

3513
02:41:46,770 --> 02:41:48,360
I was,
I was still anxious,

3514
02:41:48,450 --> 02:41:49,283
but less anxiety because I was more at 
peace with being around all these 

3515
02:41:51,181 --> 02:41:53,880
different people and stuff.
Fuck this guy who's this fucking guy.

3516
02:41:53,940 --> 02:41:58,110
I changed my strategy and it changed who
I am and then as I got into comedy,

3517
02:41:58,111 --> 02:42:01,590
I was alleviated by the actual real 
threat of competition,

3518
02:42:01,890 --> 02:42:02,723
which greatly relaxed to me.
It was a giant weight lifted off my 

3519
02:42:05,581 --> 02:42:07,740
back,
but that carried a little bit of that.

3520
02:42:07,741 --> 02:42:10,530
In the early days of stand up,
I would look at other comedians like,

3521
02:42:10,531 --> 02:42:11,364
fuck this guy.
I get jealous of guys that were doing 

3522
02:42:13,441 --> 02:42:16,770
successful I that we're doing well 
rather that we're successful.

3523
02:42:16,771 --> 02:42:18,780
I got jealous of guys who were funnier 
than me,

3524
02:42:18,781 --> 02:42:20,040
like,
why is he fucking funnier than me?

3525
02:42:20,250 --> 02:42:21,083
It was,
it was a stupid thought process and it 

3526
02:42:23,521 --> 02:42:24,660
took me till I was like,
you know,

3527
02:42:24,661 --> 02:42:28,260
like 2123 I started realizing like I got
to snap out of this.

3528
02:42:28,260 --> 02:42:29,093
This is unhealthy.
Like I'm wasting this energy where it 

3529
02:42:31,711 --> 02:42:33,330
should be concentrating on positive 
things.

3530
02:42:33,450 --> 02:42:34,283
So I just started supporting my friends.
I started being like a more 

3531
02:42:36,661 --> 02:42:38,090
complimentary person.
I started,

3532
02:42:38,130 --> 02:42:40,980
I just went out of my way to just be 
nicer to people,

3533
02:42:40,981 --> 02:42:41,814
be nicer to people,
not because they could do something for 

3534
02:42:43,741 --> 02:42:44,730
me,
just to be nice,

3535
02:42:44,840 --> 02:42:45,673
like it feels good to be nice and I just
slowly cultivated a better philosophy 

3536
02:42:49,800 --> 02:42:51,210
and it took me a while,
man.

3537
02:42:51,240 --> 02:42:53,790
It took me until I was in my twenties 
till I really like,

3538
02:42:53,970 --> 02:42:57,870
as I was like getting closer to 30 is 
when I started really getting good at it

3539
02:42:57,871 --> 02:42:59,280
with comedy,
you know,

3540
02:42:59,281 --> 02:43:02,370
like bringing comedians on the road.
Helping people.

3541
02:43:02,420 --> 02:43:05,930
Yeah.
That's fostering other career.

3542
02:43:05,940 --> 02:43:08,850
Telling kids that were like seven years 
before,

3543
02:43:08,851 --> 02:43:10,140
you know,
behind me like they were,

3544
02:43:10,141 --> 02:43:11,890
they started out seven years after me.

3545
02:43:12,200 --> 02:43:13,930
I'm at a seven years ahead of you.
You can do this.

3546
02:43:14,020 --> 02:43:15,170
Anybody can do this,
right?

3547
02:43:15,190 --> 02:43:16,300
Just do it.
Just do it.

3548
02:43:16,301 --> 02:43:18,550
And if you fuck up,
learn from that fuck up.

3549
02:43:18,551 --> 02:43:19,540
Get better.
This is,

3550
02:43:19,541 --> 02:43:21,490
this is the thing that you can do.
You're a funny person,

3551
02:43:21,730 --> 02:43:22,330
right?
You're just,

3552
02:43:22,330 --> 02:43:24,060
all you have to do is just keep doing 
this and you're gonna.

3553
02:43:24,110 --> 02:43:25,420
You already made it.
Yeah.

3554
02:43:25,550 --> 02:43:26,740
No,
this is the,

3555
02:43:26,890 --> 02:43:29,890
so this thing that you're talking about,
the thing that I,

3556
02:43:29,891 --> 02:43:30,724
that the Rom Dass people teach me,
which is invaluable and it to me and it 

3557
02:43:35,261 --> 02:43:36,094
really inspires you,
is that they talk about Ron does his 

3558
02:43:38,741 --> 02:43:39,574
guru,
neem Karoli Baba and how when he was 

3559
02:43:40,691 --> 02:43:42,580
teaching,
he never said,

3560
02:43:42,581 --> 02:43:45,220
here's what this is going to do for you.
Right?

3561
02:43:45,221 --> 02:43:46,054
He was never like,
this is why this is how it's going to 

3562
02:43:47,261 --> 02:43:49,180
help you.
He was always saying,

3563
02:43:49,181 --> 02:43:51,730
here's how this is going to help the 
people in your life.

3564
02:43:52,180 --> 02:43:53,013
And so the moment you make that little 
shift where working on yourself as it's 

3565
02:43:57,641 --> 02:44:00,790
called,
is not about doing something so that you

3566
02:44:00,791 --> 02:44:03,880
can fucking have a fucking six pack and 
played.

3567
02:44:04,480 --> 02:44:08,350
But the moment you start doing our fun 
in a cow and ride a horse,

3568
02:44:08,351 --> 02:44:10,180
shaving,
shaving your stomach,

3569
02:44:10,200 --> 02:44:11,033
but,
but the moment you start fucking doing 

3570
02:44:12,191 --> 02:44:17,191
this stuff because you know that it's 
going to directly help the people around

3571
02:44:18,821 --> 02:44:19,654
you in ways you can't even imagine.
Like you don't even know yet because 

3572
02:44:23,830 --> 02:44:27,700
there's going to be a moment in every 
single person's life where someone comes

3573
02:44:27,701 --> 02:44:28,534
up to you who is in a lot of trouble and
they need help and it might not be 

3574
02:44:33,041 --> 02:44:34,000
money,
it might not.

3575
02:44:34,180 --> 02:44:36,190
It might just be something you could say
to them.

3576
02:44:36,220 --> 02:44:37,053
It might just be something you need to 
be lucid in that moment and because 

3577
02:44:40,481 --> 02:44:42,580
you've been like,
you know,

3578
02:44:42,610 --> 02:44:46,700
not paying attention and you're blurry 
and you're angry and you're fucking shut

3579
02:44:46,701 --> 02:44:49,270
down that you're not even going to see 
that person.

3580
02:44:49,360 --> 02:44:50,193
Right.
That person is going to just be another 

3581
02:44:51,911 --> 02:44:53,830
face in the crowd that you don't even 
see.

3582
02:44:54,040 --> 02:44:57,670
But that's the whole point is like this 
practice your practice.

3583
02:44:58,550 --> 02:44:59,383
It ends up helping so many fucking 
people and if you want to get excited 

3584
02:45:03,701 --> 02:45:05,500
about something,
at least for me,

3585
02:45:05,800 --> 02:45:06,633
what makes,
it's really kind of difficult for me to 

3586
02:45:09,821 --> 02:45:12,430
get super excited over like I don't 
know,

3587
02:45:12,790 --> 02:45:16,330
some kind of like thing that's like,
and it give me an extra thing.

3588
02:45:16,331 --> 02:45:18,250
It's way less exciting than to think 
that like,

3589
02:45:18,251 --> 02:45:19,084
Shit,
man,

3590
02:45:19,150 --> 02:45:22,720
if I can be more calm and more 
connected,

3591
02:45:23,320 --> 02:45:27,400
then the next time around somebody I 
love and get angry,

3592
02:45:28,030 --> 02:45:28,863
I'm not going to hurt them because I'm 
learning how to not react to my own 

3593
02:45:32,620 --> 02:45:33,750
bullshit.
Right.

3594
02:45:33,890 --> 02:45:35,590
You know,
you're getting better at live.

3595
02:45:35,870 --> 02:45:36,520
Yeah.

3596
02:45:36,520 --> 02:45:38,020
And it's through trial and error.
I mean,

3597
02:45:38,021 --> 02:45:40,330
that is a trial error,
honesty.

3598
02:45:41,210 --> 02:45:42,043
And you also have to realize that we're 
not all coming from the same starting 

3599
02:45:44,200 --> 02:45:45,190
block.
You know?

3600
02:45:45,280 --> 02:45:46,930
Right.
Some people came from uh,

3601
02:45:46,931 --> 02:45:47,764
abusive childhoods.
Some people came from super supportive 

3602
02:45:50,201 --> 02:45:52,720
and loving childhood.
Some people were spoiled as children and

3603
02:45:52,721 --> 02:45:53,554
that's what they're,
they're the people that struggle the 

3604
02:45:54,251 --> 02:45:55,084
most.
Sometimes you see in kids that grow up 

3605
02:45:57,161 --> 02:46:01,030
in like really rich families where the 
pee pee parents weren't hands on.

3606
02:46:01,510 --> 02:46:02,960
They're so disconnected.
Right.

3607
02:46:02,961 --> 02:46:03,794
You feel really weird and titled and 
they have a very distorted version of 

3608
02:46:06,611 --> 02:46:08,140
the future.
And those people,

3609
02:46:08,141 --> 02:46:10,580
it's very hard.
It's very hard to adjust from a place of

3610
02:46:10,581 --> 02:46:11,420
bounty,
right.

3611
02:46:11,540 --> 02:46:14,750
To a place of struggle and success and 
in in,

3612
02:46:14,780 --> 02:46:15,613
you know,
self realization almost more difficult 

3613
02:46:17,840 --> 02:46:18,673
for some of those people.
Compassion look neat growing up as a 

3614
02:46:21,021 --> 02:46:22,550
person who didn't have money,
you know,

3615
02:46:22,551 --> 02:46:24,200
and,
and thinking as when I was a child,

3616
02:46:24,201 --> 02:46:28,370
when my family was on welfare,
thinking I still can remember at least I

3617
02:46:28,371 --> 02:46:29,204
have a,
an idea of a memory of us drinking 

3618
02:46:31,401 --> 02:46:32,234
powdered milk.

3619
02:46:32,360 --> 02:46:33,193
I remember that.
I remember being really embarrassed if 

3620
02:46:36,541 --> 02:46:38,810
people would come over our house.
We had powdered milk,

3621
02:46:38,811 --> 02:46:39,900
we are poor,
you know,

3622
02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:44,920
and that memory of being a young man,
of being a struggling young comedian,

3623
02:46:46,461 --> 02:46:49,340
doing a bunch of odd jobs,
trying to make it like this,

3624
02:46:49,370 --> 02:46:50,203
this real hunger and worry.
I remember one of the most embarrassing 

3625
02:46:52,821 --> 02:46:55,430
moments of my young life,
um,

3626
02:46:55,431 --> 02:46:56,264
I had this thing fall out.
It was like some management company was 

3627
02:46:59,991 --> 02:47:00,824
interested in me and they were like a 
music management company and they were 

3628
02:47:04,101 --> 02:47:04,934
thinking about branching off into 
comedians and guy was talking to me 

3629
02:47:06,591 --> 02:47:10,700
about it and it was falling apart and I 
was driving with my girlfriend and I was

3630
02:47:10,701 --> 02:47:11,534
21 and the whole thing was so 
frustrating to me that I just started 

3631
02:47:13,581 --> 02:47:15,080
crying,
tears rolling.

3632
02:47:15,081 --> 02:47:16,340
And I remember she looked over and she's
like,

3633
02:47:16,341 --> 02:47:17,174
are you crying?

3634
02:47:17,510 --> 02:47:18,410
I was like,
yeah,

3635
02:47:18,620 --> 02:47:20,090
fuck yeah.
And she's like,

3636
02:47:20,120 --> 02:47:20,953
oh.
Like she was like mocking the fact that 

3637
02:47:24,471 --> 02:47:26,750
I was crying.
She couldn't help herself,

3638
02:47:26,840 --> 02:47:28,280
you know,
she was same age,

3639
02:47:28,281 --> 02:47:30,470
we're both at 21 we were both kids,
you know,

3640
02:47:30,471 --> 02:47:31,850
and she just thought it was a bitch 
move.

3641
02:47:32,150 --> 02:47:34,910
Just be crying about being frustrated 
about your career.

3642
02:47:34,911 --> 02:47:36,110
And I remember being so embarrassed,
like,

3643
02:47:36,111 --> 02:47:39,620
why did I,
why did I let that out to her?

3644
02:47:39,621 --> 02:47:42,170
Like,
why did I let that out in public at this

3645
02:47:42,171 --> 02:47:45,620
frustration of not knowing where the 
future lies,

3646
02:47:45,980 --> 02:47:46,813
but that frustration and that hunger of 
like wanting to figure out a way to get 

3647
02:47:51,261 --> 02:47:52,094
out of this cycle of work in shitty jobs
and figure out how to do something that 

3648
02:47:54,711 --> 02:47:57,050
I actually love doing.
Like be a comic that,

3649
02:47:57,290 --> 02:47:59,480
that burning hunger cause you don't have
shit.

3650
02:47:59,660 --> 02:48:00,920
That's where it all comes from.

3651
02:48:00,950 --> 02:48:02,780
Would you don't know where the fuck 
you're going to pay your rent.

3652
02:48:03,020 --> 02:48:05,030
You do.
You do not have an escape route.

3653
02:48:05,270 --> 02:48:08,210
There's no net.
You got to figure this fucking thing out

3654
02:48:08,211 --> 02:48:09,860
man and you're not figuring it out right
now.

3655
02:48:09,861 --> 02:48:12,530
Right now it's fallen apart and nobody,
nobody thinks you're any good.

3656
02:48:12,531 --> 02:48:13,364
You can't get booked like fuck.
You're trying to figure out what's the 

3657
02:48:15,231 --> 02:48:16,730
next job.
You're going to get it so you could feed

3658
02:48:16,731 --> 02:48:17,564
yourself.
We tried to figure out this weird thing 

3659
02:48:18,711 --> 02:48:20,330
that nobody could really tell you how to
do,

3660
02:48:20,940 --> 02:48:23,030
you know,
but then going through that struggle,

3661
02:48:23,240 --> 02:48:24,073
that is everything,
but people need to hear that you went 

3662
02:48:27,231 --> 02:48:28,720
through it too.
They need to hear that,

3663
02:48:28,721 --> 02:48:29,554
that during the dark days where it 
doesn't seem like it's ever going to 

3664
02:48:30,891 --> 02:48:32,750
work out,
are you alive?

3665
02:48:32,960 --> 02:48:34,670
Can you see?
Can you talk?

3666
02:48:34,671 --> 02:48:36,980
Can you think get better,
get better,

3667
02:48:37,010 --> 02:48:38,090
get better,
whatever you're doing,

3668
02:48:38,300 --> 02:48:39,800
skip better so you suck at it.

3669
02:48:39,800 --> 02:48:42,590
Now everybody sucks at everything when 
they first start.

3670
02:48:43,010 --> 02:48:45,260
That's the whole thing about getting 
good at something,

3671
02:48:45,261 --> 02:48:46,880
but if you love it and you're really 
honest,

3672
02:48:47,030 --> 02:48:48,980
don't lie to yourself.
Don't lie to yourself.

3673
02:48:48,981 --> 02:48:49,814
Look at it for what it is.
Look at it for what it is and work on 

3674
02:48:51,201 --> 02:48:52,370
it.
Whatever the fuck it is,

3675
02:48:52,490 --> 02:48:57,490
whether it's writing books or make you 
sick or composing a computer code,

3676
02:48:58,430 --> 02:49:01,700
whatever the fuck you want to do.
If you suck at it,

3677
02:49:02,210 --> 02:49:04,850
get better.
But look at it for what it is.

3678
02:49:04,910 --> 02:49:07,530
Look at it for really what it is and 
that's one of our biggest problems.

3679
02:49:07,770 --> 02:49:08,603
One of our biggest problems is that 
people have a really hard time looking 

3680
02:49:10,921 --> 02:49:12,530
at things for what they are if they're 
not flattering.

3681
02:49:12,540 --> 02:49:13,740
That's right.
Yeah.

3682
02:49:13,741 --> 02:49:15,300
Do you want to think,
oh fuck this guy.

3683
02:49:15,330 --> 02:49:20,330
Fuck this guy goes a pussy now that guy,
it shot a fucking rocket into space with

3684
02:49:20,401 --> 02:49:21,234
a car on it.

3685
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:23,730
Okay.
And he did it with his mind.

3686
02:49:24,020 --> 02:49:25,860
He figured out how to make these 
calculations.

3687
02:49:25,861 --> 02:49:28,980
You figured out how to make enough money
so he could shoot a car in a space.

3688
02:49:29,100 --> 02:49:32,610
If you don't respect that,
it's digging tunnels under La.

3689
02:49:32,640 --> 02:49:33,473
They'll let them dig tunnels.
There's an earthquake ridden area and 

3690
02:49:36,331 --> 02:49:38,730
this motherfucker is digging holes in 
the ground.

3691
02:49:38,880 --> 02:49:41,760
We're worried about fracking,
but we're like Eli musk got it.

3692
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:43,440
He said it's not going to cause an 
earthquake.

3693
02:49:43,441 --> 02:49:44,940
It's not going to cause an earthquake.
Yeah,

3694
02:49:45,240 --> 02:49:46,073
we're worried about people fracking.
We're not worried about Elon musk 

3695
02:49:47,820 --> 02:49:49,980
turning our fucking city into Swiss 
cheese.

3696
02:49:50,130 --> 02:49:51,450
Yeah,
but you know,

3697
02:49:51,451 --> 02:49:52,284
man,
the thing is is that the guy you're 

3698
02:49:53,910 --> 02:49:56,700
make,
you're like creating an image of the guy

3699
02:49:56,710 --> 02:49:57,850
was like Fuck Elan.
Good.

3700
02:49:57,860 --> 02:50:01,320
That guy is real real.
That's real.

3701
02:50:01,350 --> 02:50:03,150
That's me.
I was 21 right.

3702
02:50:03,500 --> 02:50:06,540
Can you felt like you can quit and you 
felt like shit.

3703
02:50:07,050 --> 02:50:07,883
That's the important thing is like that.
That's all coming from feeling like 

3704
02:50:10,951 --> 02:50:11,784
shit.
And when you get around somebody who's 

3705
02:50:14,371 --> 02:50:18,750
acting like that,
if you've looked into yourself enough to

3706
02:50:18,751 --> 02:50:19,584
see where you feel like shit and then 
you get around somebody and you realize 

3707
02:50:22,621 --> 02:50:23,454
like,
oh this person is like being a complete 

3708
02:50:25,980 --> 02:50:30,360
fucking cunt to me right now feels like 
shit.

3709
02:50:30,840 --> 02:50:34,950
And this is the,
I went to see the Dalai Lama and Anaheim

3710
02:50:35,340 --> 02:50:37,410
and who you're partnering with Ron Doss.
The Dalai Lama.

3711
02:50:37,411 --> 02:50:39,060
Wow.
This is like not parting with it.

3712
02:50:39,120 --> 02:50:41,250
I would love to party with a fucking 
Dalai Lama.

3713
02:50:41,280 --> 02:50:42,113
I would love that.
I'm really might nullify my cock if I 

3714
02:50:44,431 --> 02:50:47,370
got a chance to party with the Dalai 
Lama space forever.

3715
02:50:47,371 --> 02:50:48,720
It's another thing to talk to.
I'd do.

3716
02:50:48,930 --> 02:50:49,763
I'd love to be around that guy man.
Just cause like when he was like so far 

3717
02:50:52,201 --> 02:50:54,360
down in this massive place,
this little guy,

3718
02:50:55,140 --> 02:50:55,973
you could feel his,
the energy rushing off of this guy into 

3719
02:50:59,131 --> 02:51:01,910
the room.
It will be trippin maybe.

3720
02:51:02,880 --> 02:51:03,930
But anyway.
But anyway,

3721
02:51:04,360 --> 02:51:08,520
the thing that he said that stuck with 
me as he's like,

3722
02:51:11,100 --> 02:51:14,100
one of the things he says is so simple 
and it reminds me what you're saying now

3723
02:51:14,101 --> 02:51:18,450
is he said you can always be kinder.
And then the other thing he said,

3724
02:51:18,480 --> 02:51:21,120
and it sounds so simple,
but really people don't realize that you

3725
02:51:21,121 --> 02:51:21,954
can always be kinder at any moment.
And then the other thing he said is if 

3726
02:51:24,721 --> 02:51:29,340
someone's being unkind to you,
it's not them being unkind to you.

3727
02:51:29,340 --> 02:51:31,170
It's an echo,
is what he said.

3728
02:51:31,200 --> 02:51:32,033
Like it's literally an echo of the 
unkindness people being cruel to them 

3729
02:51:36,871 --> 02:51:41,610
throughout their lives and that shit is 
bouncing off of them like sound.

3730
02:51:41,850 --> 02:51:45,640
It's bouncing onto you.
And so when you get around someone who's

3731
02:51:45,660 --> 02:51:46,493
like being a shit,
what you're really experiencing is that 

3732
02:51:50,020 --> 02:51:54,690
there you're a lot of sorrow from a lot 
of places you don't know.

3733
02:51:54,840 --> 02:51:55,673
And that doesn't mean you're supposed to
lay back and let them like spit on you 

3734
02:51:58,981 --> 02:52:01,710
or be a shithead to you or whatever.
But it also,

3735
02:52:01,711 --> 02:52:04,350
it helps you find a little bit of 
compassion,

3736
02:52:04,510 --> 02:52:06,580
right?
That's just just so you can be with that

3737
02:52:06,581 --> 02:52:11,581
person and let them be what they are 
without adding more suffering to it.

3738
02:52:13,340 --> 02:52:15,580
Right?
Which only compounds

3739
02:52:15,700 --> 02:52:17,050
this situation.
Well,

3740
02:52:17,080 --> 02:52:20,840
you have to learn how people are 
responding to that behavior too and,

3741
02:52:20,841 --> 02:52:21,674
and adjust accordingly.
Get and do the hard work and look at 

3742
02:52:24,251 --> 02:52:25,084
yourself.
And when people get super self 

3743
02:52:27,041 --> 02:52:27,874
indulgent,
one of the things that they do is they 

3744
02:52:28,451 --> 02:52:30,580
don't think about how other people are 
experiencing them.

3745
02:52:30,650 --> 02:52:31,483
Right?
Like if you're around people like 

3746
02:52:32,021 --> 02:52:35,200
fucking the fucking worse look always 
fucking happens to me.

3747
02:52:35,410 --> 02:52:40,200
It's safety every day at work.
Fucking boss knows it wasn't.

3748
02:52:40,210 --> 02:52:44,830
Mike did put in the work.
I put fucking 65 70% of the work.

3749
02:52:45,420 --> 02:52:46,880
Yes.
Yes.

3750
02:52:48,320 --> 02:52:49,450
Whoa.
Does she leave?

3751
02:52:51,780 --> 02:52:53,620
Yeah,
those people are gross.

3752
02:52:53,621 --> 02:52:54,790
You're like,
I gotta go,

3753
02:52:54,791 --> 02:52:55,930
man.
I can't.

3754
02:52:55,931 --> 02:52:57,490
When people started go,
which don't do,

3755
02:52:57,760 --> 02:52:59,350
what is the worst thing people do to 
you?

3756
02:52:59,410 --> 02:53:00,380
When we were,
what should I do?

3757
02:53:00,440 --> 02:53:02,280
What did the should do?
Metal neutral advice and needs.

3758
02:53:02,300 --> 02:53:02,821
Invites.
Hey,

3759
02:53:02,821 --> 02:53:03,654
hey,
hey.

3760
02:53:04,120 --> 02:53:04,953
No,
you don't.

3761
02:53:05,320 --> 02:53:06,400
You dust sound.
What's going on?

3762
02:53:06,401 --> 02:53:07,234
You want me to talk about you?
You're making me focus on you 100% 

3763
02:53:10,691 --> 02:53:13,810
you're not asking me for help for 
yourself.

3764
02:53:13,900 --> 02:53:14,733
You're not helping yourself at all.
What you're doing is making me 

3765
02:53:17,111 --> 02:53:18,970
concentrate on you are,
bro.

3766
02:53:19,020 --> 02:53:20,800
Fuck,
I'm really feeling depressed right now.

3767
02:53:20,920 --> 02:53:22,510
Well,
do something about it.

3768
02:53:23,440 --> 02:53:25,330
I'm not saying don't reach out to your 
friends,

3769
02:53:25,331 --> 02:53:27,540
but I'm saying you got to do something 
to man.

3770
02:53:27,940 --> 02:53:29,950
You can't just always talk about your 
problems.

3771
02:53:30,620 --> 02:53:31,453
Talk about my problems.
You didn't want to hear him because 

3772
02:53:32,591 --> 02:53:33,670
that's all you talk about.

3773
02:53:34,360 --> 02:53:35,680
What's your whole life?
A problem,

3774
02:53:35,860 --> 02:53:37,630
right?
Jesus Christ.

3775
02:53:37,660 --> 02:53:39,950
Maybe that's the way you're thinking.
Maybe this is the way you're behaving.

3776
02:53:39,990 --> 02:53:40,823
We mapped out your life or am I saying 
that you shouldn't be there for your 

3777
02:53:43,361 --> 02:53:44,194
friends when issues arise and there's a,
certainly all of our friends are super 

3778
02:53:47,831 --> 02:53:48,664
supportive.
We've all gone through some weird shit 

3779
02:53:49,911 --> 02:53:51,970
in our lives.
We've all been super supportive,

3780
02:53:51,971 --> 02:53:52,804
but if I'm super supportive to you,
I know you're super supportive to 

3781
02:53:54,821 --> 02:53:55,940
yourself.
Yeah,

3782
02:53:55,990 --> 02:53:58,240
I know you're working on yourself too,
right?

3783
02:53:58,330 --> 02:53:59,990
Not just relying on me.
They broke.

3784
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:01,900
What should I do today,
which I do tomorrow?

3785
02:54:02,160 --> 02:54:04,450
What are you thinking?
If you could sit down here with me for a

3786
02:54:04,450 --> 02:54:05,283
few hours and map out my future roadway 
pressured cause it's just fucking hard 

3787
02:54:09,661 --> 02:54:11,750
out there for me bro.
You gotta do shit.

3788
02:54:11,760 --> 02:54:14,320
Don't fucking bullshit dude.
You're fucking,

3789
02:54:14,321 --> 02:54:16,510
you know man.
Fuck you had a good headstart.

3790
02:54:16,600 --> 02:54:19,990
You're white guard from North Carolina.
Fuck you dude.

3791
02:54:21,160 --> 02:54:21,993
It's what it is man.
Come up these toxic excuses for why 

3792
02:54:24,851 --> 02:54:27,580
their life is shit without ever looking 
inward.

3793
02:54:27,581 --> 02:54:28,414
And they'd want you to admit your 
privilege and admit your fucking 

3794
02:54:30,581 --> 02:54:31,414
advantages bro.
Hello you Duncan [inaudible] it was 

3795
02:54:34,661 --> 02:54:36,280
easier for you.
The truth for me.

3796
02:54:36,980 --> 02:54:37,813
But,

3797
02:54:39,250 --> 02:54:41,800
but the question is like,
cause I know exactly what you're talking

3798
02:54:41,801 --> 02:54:42,634
about and I know that person and I know 
when I run into that with that is 

3799
02:54:49,661 --> 02:54:50,494
there's a part of me that,
and I like what I know sometimes you 

3800
02:54:53,591 --> 02:54:57,310
just have to put someone you have to 
like avoid their presence.

3801
02:54:57,370 --> 02:54:59,110
So you gonna say put them on blast.
I thought you were going,

3802
02:54:59,111 --> 02:55:00,850
can I put them on blast?
No,

3803
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:02,440
cause it doesn't work.
That doesn't work.

3804
02:55:02,441 --> 02:55:04,040
But maybe it does for you.
I don't know,

3805
02:55:04,041 --> 02:55:05,240
but it does put,
there's a,

3806
02:55:05,480 --> 02:55:06,920
they just get mad at you,
right?

3807
02:55:06,921 --> 02:55:09,190
So,
but there is a thing of like I,

3808
02:55:09,370 --> 02:55:10,203
and this is where I might just be 
fucking naive or crazy or one toke over 

3809
02:55:14,181 --> 02:55:15,250
the line,
sweet.

3810
02:55:15,251 --> 02:55:19,790
But I believe that with any body that 
you're around,

3811
02:55:19,940 --> 02:55:23,600
if you've cultivated love,
like if you can really love them,

3812
02:55:23,990 --> 02:55:27,560
even in the midst of that cyclone of 
bullshit that you're talking about,

3813
02:55:28,010 --> 02:55:31,760
if you could look through the cyclone 
right into their soul,

3814
02:55:31,761 --> 02:55:35,270
like into what they are that's love and 
see that and love it,

3815
02:55:35,630 --> 02:55:39,440
then the psych clonal start calming down
a little bit right in front of you.

3816
02:55:39,650 --> 02:55:42,710
I think it's possible.
I think it's possible that if,

3817
02:55:42,711 --> 02:55:43,544
and this is why I think it's fucking 
worth figuring out a way to cultivate 

3818
02:55:46,941 --> 02:55:47,774
this shit that you're talking about so 
that when you get around a Turd cycline 

3819
02:55:50,540 --> 02:55:53,000
like that,
you know that you,

3820
02:55:53,060 --> 02:55:53,893
you actually,
you become potentially the person who 

3821
02:55:57,801 --> 02:56:00,860
like not by giving them money or giving 
them advice,

3822
02:56:01,100 --> 02:56:01,933
but just by giving them love and letting
them be this cyclone of shit for a 

3823
02:56:05,661 --> 02:56:09,890
second and loving it for real.
You might be the thing that,

3824
02:56:09,950 --> 02:56:14,540
that just like musk's fucking tesla hits
the media or in sends it into earth,

3825
02:56:14,750 --> 02:56:15,583
you might be the thing that dings the 
media or of their life and prevents the 

3826
02:56:18,561 --> 02:56:20,600
catastrophe that they were spinning 
towards.

3827
02:56:20,690 --> 02:56:21,523
It's entirely possible,
but it's also entirely possible that 

3828
02:56:23,571 --> 02:56:27,050
like most things in life,
you need a lot of various elements.

3829
02:56:27,051 --> 02:56:28,730
You don't just need one person,
right,

3830
02:56:28,760 --> 02:56:31,190
that you cling to.
You mean to look at humanity as a whole.

3831
02:56:31,191 --> 02:56:32,024
You need to seek inspiration in the 
great work of others and you need to 

3832
02:56:34,401 --> 02:56:38,720
look at yourself in a way that you think
maybe perhaps other people look at you.

3833
02:56:38,810 --> 02:56:39,643
Right.
And that is something that a lot of 

3834
02:56:40,071 --> 02:56:40,904
people don't do.
And that lack of introspection and self 

3835
02:56:43,641 --> 02:56:46,220
critical thinking is one of the reasons 
why people don't change.

3836
02:56:46,340 --> 02:56:47,690
Right.
Cause they don't adjust.

3837
02:56:47,760 --> 02:56:48,593
Right.
Like you're not the guy you were 10 

3838
02:56:50,151 --> 02:56:51,800
years ago.
I've known you for a long time.

3839
02:56:51,801 --> 02:56:54,260
You're a better version because you've 
adjusted.

3840
02:56:54,280 --> 02:56:55,760
Yeah.
I mean not that you were bad then.

3841
02:56:55,761 --> 02:56:57,890
I love you back then you were awesome.
But you're,

3842
02:56:58,030 --> 02:57:01,670
you're a more together,
more philosophical,

3843
02:57:01,850 --> 02:57:05,570
more at ease with yourself person than 
you were 10 15 years ago.

3844
02:57:05,600 --> 02:57:07,640
Yeah.
Like when we were living together and I,

3845
02:57:07,790 --> 02:57:10,910
we lived together when you were at a 
down spot.

3846
02:57:11,330 --> 02:57:12,950
You're a totally different human now.
Yeah.

3847
02:57:13,310 --> 02:57:13,881
Cool.
Yeah.

3848
02:57:13,881 --> 02:57:15,260
And you are begin.
And that's the thing,

3849
02:57:15,261 --> 02:57:16,094
man.
Because you are like in those moments 

3850
02:57:18,470 --> 02:57:19,303
when you were like,
when we're riding in my fucking mini 

3851
02:57:21,201 --> 02:57:23,240
cooper and I'm trying to listen to 
Elliot Smith and you know,

3852
02:57:23,241 --> 02:57:24,074
I'm depressed

3853
02:57:24,740 --> 02:57:25,461
and you're like,
dude,

3854
02:57:25,461 --> 02:57:28,490
what are you listening to?
What the fuck you listening to you?

3855
02:57:28,520 --> 02:57:29,990
I'll never forget that.
And I'll tell you,

3856
02:57:29,991 --> 02:57:31,100
man,
in my head,

3857
02:57:31,340 --> 02:57:32,173
I'm like,
what a Dick was definitely being the 

3858
02:57:35,690 --> 02:57:36,060
day.
Yeah.

3859
02:57:36,060 --> 02:57:36,511
But,
but,

3860
02:57:36,511 --> 02:57:40,040
but that what,
what that was was like though,

3861
02:57:40,280 --> 02:57:42,220
it was what you were doing is helping 
me,

3862
02:57:42,221 --> 02:57:44,860
like get out of that vibration that I 
was,

3863
02:57:44,890 --> 02:57:46,490
you were wallowing in it.
Yes.

3864
02:57:46,720 --> 02:57:47,553
And I needed in it.
And I didn't in those moments when you 

3865
02:57:50,051 --> 02:57:53,180
were doing that shit,
I was like in my head resisting.

3866
02:57:53,200 --> 02:57:54,100
And I'm like,
you know,

3867
02:57:54,250 --> 02:57:55,083
but that's the other thing,
when you decide to help somebody and 

3868
02:57:58,391 --> 02:58:02,370
that way you can't expect it's going to,
there's shift or change.

3869
02:58:02,371 --> 02:58:05,760
It's going to happen instantaneously.
But because of that,

3870
02:58:06,060 --> 02:58:09,510
I still to this day when I put on Elliot
Smith,

3871
02:58:10,290 --> 02:58:11,920
I think at that moment,
man,

3872
02:58:12,150 --> 02:58:14,840
I still,
they hear your voice in my head going to

3873
02:58:14,900 --> 02:58:15,733
go,
he it,

3874
02:58:15,840 --> 02:58:19,490
what are you doing?
Because you know what I mean?

3875
02:58:19,500 --> 02:58:20,460
Because,
because,

3876
02:58:20,461 --> 02:58:24,060
and I'll tell you why man.
Because sometimes when you can listen to

3877
02:58:24,061 --> 02:58:27,590
Elliot Smith and not be wallowing and 
it's just really pretty and sweet,

3878
02:58:28,050 --> 02:58:31,290
but don't listen to that shit if you're 
wallowing because it's like,

3879
02:58:31,291 --> 02:58:31,670
it's,
yeah.

3880
02:58:31,670 --> 02:58:32,920
Oh,
won't feed the wallet.

3881
02:58:32,980 --> 02:58:34,330
Don't feed the wall.
Yeah.

3882
02:58:34,331 --> 02:58:37,030
Don't feed that wallowing spirit inside 
of you.

3883
02:58:37,050 --> 02:58:37,883
Don't.
You don't need to feel that everybody 

3884
02:58:39,731 --> 02:58:42,400
experiences loss and everybody 
experiences bad moments.

3885
02:58:42,401 --> 02:58:44,680
You just going to you,
you never going to get life perfect.

3886
02:58:44,681 --> 02:58:46,600
Right?
So during these bad moments,

3887
02:58:46,601 --> 02:58:48,480
what you got to realize is just 
accepted.

3888
02:58:48,490 --> 02:58:50,260
Feel it,
get through it.

3889
02:58:50,261 --> 02:58:52,450
Realize it's a journey that you're going
to get through.

3890
02:58:52,451 --> 02:58:53,284
But yeah,
realize that there's better ways to 

3891
02:58:55,121 --> 02:58:58,420
navigate it.
Then some and some ways are really bad.

3892
02:58:58,430 --> 02:58:59,263
The is a really bad way to navigate it 
and started doing heroin and start 

3893
02:59:01,691 --> 02:59:05,410
fucking listen to Elliot Smith ago 
holding a knife over your stomach in the

3894
02:59:05,411 --> 02:59:08,350
middle of your fucking bedroom going,
fuck it man.

3895
02:59:08,650 --> 02:59:10,160
Fuck it,
man.

3896
02:59:10,180 --> 02:59:11,830
I can't do that.
You can't do that.

3897
02:59:11,860 --> 02:59:13,330
Well,
you can look him,

3898
02:59:13,390 --> 02:59:16,150
but it's not,
it's not the healthiest way to go.

3899
02:59:16,151 --> 02:59:19,900
That's going to give people around you 
and you yourself the most joy.

3900
02:59:20,390 --> 02:59:23,530
It's not necessarily selfish,
it's self indulgent for sure.

3901
02:59:23,740 --> 02:59:25,450
I don't necessarily think it's selfish.
I think it's just,

3902
02:59:25,451 --> 02:59:26,284
it's,
it's a pattern of behavior that you can 

3903
02:59:28,391 --> 02:59:29,480
get trapped in.
Yeah.

3904
02:59:29,500 --> 02:59:33,070
And I think we've all been in bad 
situations where you just feel like shit

3905
02:59:33,071 --> 02:59:35,710
like you,
you get in a pattern of behavior and you

3906
02:59:35,711 --> 02:59:37,230
feel trapped,
but you gotta,

3907
02:59:37,530 --> 02:59:38,363
you gotta learn from other people who've
been through those patterns and learn 

3908
02:59:41,231 --> 02:59:42,930
from your own experiences getting 
through pat.

3909
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:44,020
Yeah.
Cause you get you,

3910
02:59:44,021 --> 02:59:48,160
well that's the thing man.
It's like when you get around someone,

3911
02:59:48,370 --> 02:59:50,960
he's like a teacher figure.
Like you early,

3912
02:59:50,961 --> 02:59:51,794
you get around somebody know that he was
like really doing it from love and not 

3913
02:59:53,891 --> 02:59:56,200
trying to fucking like fuck with you 
because that's,

3914
02:59:56,380 --> 02:59:59,000
that can happen the worst or be superior
to you or,

3915
02:59:59,001 --> 02:59:59,610
right,
right,

3916
02:59:59,610 --> 03:00:01,270
right.
Pull you down and yeah.

3917
03:00:01,300 --> 03:00:02,133
Yeah.
You down when you get around somebody 

3918
03:00:03,101 --> 03:00:05,110
who's like doing it out of,
out of love.

3919
03:00:05,380 --> 03:00:10,380
There is such a massive difference in,
in the,

3920
03:00:10,961 --> 03:00:11,794
in the way that feels and,
and what they do quite often or what a 

3921
03:00:15,281 --> 03:00:16,114
lot of my teachers do,
which is really fucking cool because 

3922
03:00:18,341 --> 03:00:20,520
like in the same way you've seen me kind
of go shift,

3923
03:00:20,880 --> 03:00:21,713
you know,
a lot of my teachers from the Rom dies 

3924
03:00:22,780 --> 03:00:23,613
camp like in the beginning when I was 
actively trying to offend them because 

3925
03:00:27,191 --> 03:00:28,024
that was what I would try to do.
It's like it'd be funny not be funny 

3926
03:00:30,311 --> 03:00:34,240
cause I was thinking if I can offend 
these people about the practice,

3927
03:00:34,241 --> 03:00:36,040
they're teaching me and they're like,
hey,

3928
03:00:36,041 --> 03:00:39,400
you can't say that or that's blasphemy 
or anything like that.

3929
03:00:39,610 --> 03:00:41,680
Then I know to get the fuck out of there
cause it's like,

3930
03:00:42,100 --> 03:00:43,270
you know what I mean?
Because you were,

3931
03:00:43,271 --> 03:00:45,300
you were calculated.
Fuck yeah.

3932
03:00:45,310 --> 03:00:47,680
Is calculated with one.
It was one of my teachers.

3933
03:00:47,720 --> 03:00:48,553
Ragu,

3934
03:00:49,010 --> 03:00:50,820
his name's Ragu.
Like the spaghetti sauce.

3935
03:00:50,990 --> 03:00:54,010
It means a different thing in the,
it does change your name Bro.

3936
03:00:54,900 --> 03:00:57,770
It's a,
my name's spaghettios but listen bro,

3937
03:00:58,040 --> 03:01:02,380
don't think about it like that.
And my master spaghettios taught me,

3938
03:01:02,400 --> 03:01:03,790
what the fuck did you just,

3939
03:01:04,050 --> 03:01:06,090
he's amazing.
He's amazing.

3940
03:01:06,240 --> 03:01:09,690
And like in the same sauce the same way 
you're doing that with the garlic,

3941
03:01:10,110 --> 03:01:10,943
the same way you're doing that with him.
I would try to do that with like their 

3942
03:01:13,141 --> 03:01:14,250
teachers and,
and,

3943
03:01:14,251 --> 03:01:14,660
and,
but,

3944
03:01:14,660 --> 03:01:16,680
and I would try to do that too because I
was like,

3945
03:01:16,681 --> 03:01:17,514
fuck it.
If they get mad at me right then I know 

3946
03:01:20,190 --> 03:01:23,140
then who cares if there's a thing where 
I don't like blasphemy,

3947
03:01:23,160 --> 03:01:24,750
I don't like the idea.
I can blast fee,

3948
03:01:24,751 --> 03:01:26,430
man,
that freaks me the fuck out.

3949
03:01:26,640 --> 03:01:29,340
But it was like when named Karoli Baba,
you know,

3950
03:01:29,341 --> 03:01:30,600
they tell me these stories and I'd be 
like,

3951
03:01:30,601 --> 03:01:31,650
you know,
I just don't,

3952
03:01:32,280 --> 03:01:34,650
I just don't really believe that man.
Like I don't know if that it's,

3953
03:01:34,680 --> 03:01:37,250
I don't know if I believed that shit.
And rog you,

3954
03:01:37,251 --> 03:01:38,084
I still remember saying that walking in 
this at the retreat with him in Hawaii 

3955
03:01:40,950 --> 03:01:42,720
and he gets a big smile on his face.

3956
03:01:42,720 --> 03:01:43,553
He's like,
yeah,

3957
03:01:43,950 --> 03:01:44,783
yeah,
I don't blame you for not believing in 

3958
03:01:45,421 --> 03:01:46,410
it.
It's like,

3959
03:01:46,411 --> 03:01:47,850
Whoa,
cool man,

3960
03:01:48,360 --> 03:01:51,150
this is fucking cool.
And it's that.

3961
03:01:51,330 --> 03:01:53,820
That's the,
so when you get around a real teacher,

3962
03:01:53,970 --> 03:01:56,340
what I'm saying is the place that you're
at,

3963
03:01:56,820 --> 03:01:57,653
they let you be there,
but they're not like in the sense that 

3964
03:02:01,381 --> 03:02:03,900
they're letting you do the pattern that 
you're in.

3965
03:02:04,230 --> 03:02:05,063
But by allowing that to happen in its 
own way and then adding to it the 

3966
03:02:08,131 --> 03:02:11,730
intention of like,
I think I'm going to help you grow here.

3967
03:02:12,060 --> 03:02:15,480
That's when you really start changing.
Not when someone's like you,

3968
03:02:15,481 --> 03:02:16,314
when you were in the car and listen to 
Elliot Smith and you were fucking 

3969
03:02:19,231 --> 03:02:24,120
recognizing in me a lot of sadness and a
lot of fucked up Nez.

3970
03:02:24,630 --> 03:02:26,820
You weren't scolding me,
dude,

3971
03:02:26,850 --> 03:02:27,683
you are giving me love.
But the way you were giving me what I 

3972
03:02:29,440 --> 03:02:33,240
love was by making fun of me in this 
really sweet way.

3973
03:02:33,300 --> 03:02:35,220
And it worked.
You know what I mean?

3974
03:02:35,221 --> 03:02:36,001
It was,
it was.

3975
03:02:36,001 --> 03:02:38,430
So that's the thing.
That's what a real teacher does.

3976
03:02:38,431 --> 03:02:40,230
And that's why it's like,
you know,

3977
03:02:40,231 --> 03:02:41,064
it took to learn how to get to that spot
is one of the most important things you 

3978
03:02:44,851 --> 03:02:45,684
could do.

3979
03:02:46,010 --> 03:02:49,480
Also from a selfish standpoint,
um,

3980
03:02:49,550 --> 03:02:50,383
when you have a good friend that is all 
sudden looking for a place to live and 

3981
03:02:54,141 --> 03:02:56,240
then they could live with you,
it's cool,

3982
03:02:56,241 --> 03:02:57,074
it's far right.
But it also feels really good to help 

3983
03:02:59,751 --> 03:03:02,630
some money to help somebody that you 
love and you really care about.

3984
03:03:02,900 --> 03:03:03,733
So I mean,
I don't even think I thought about it 

3985
03:03:05,781 --> 03:03:06,614
for three seconds.
When you called me up and you were in a 

3986
03:03:08,601 --> 03:03:09,291
hotel room,
I go,

3987
03:03:09,291 --> 03:03:10,250
dude,
come live with me.

3988
03:03:10,251 --> 03:03:13,040
Yeah,
it was like instantly Dunkin's live with

3989
03:03:13,041 --> 03:03:14,540
me instantly.
I was like,

3990
03:03:14,541 --> 03:03:15,920
she got a place to live,
dude.

3991
03:03:15,921 --> 03:03:18,050
You never have to worry about having a 
place to live.

3992
03:03:18,380 --> 03:03:20,030
I wanted you to,
you know,

3993
03:03:20,120 --> 03:03:20,953
and also you were,
I've had a lot of people that have 

3994
03:03:23,871 --> 03:03:26,570
offered the tank to anytime you want,
come on by,

3995
03:03:26,571 --> 03:03:27,404
you can use tank.

3996
03:03:27,890 --> 03:03:31,160
You were the only guy who use it on a 
regular basis.

3997
03:03:31,161 --> 03:03:31,994
Like when it tate live with me.
He didn't touch that fucking crazy 

3998
03:03:34,401 --> 03:03:35,510
thing.
He's like,

3999
03:03:35,511 --> 03:03:37,940
fuck this.
He might've gotten in there once,

4000
03:03:37,941 --> 03:03:41,060
I don't know,
but that was not his style at the time,

4001
03:03:41,090 --> 03:03:41,923
you know?
But you were in there all the time and 

4002
03:03:43,191 --> 03:03:45,230
you were writing journals and shit.
When you get out of,

4003
03:03:45,300 --> 03:03:46,133
then we would talk about it.
You would talk about your inner voyage 

4004
03:03:48,950 --> 03:03:52,630
when you'd go in that tank and just 
think about your life and how you,

4005
03:03:52,660 --> 03:03:53,493
you're,
you know,

4006
03:03:53,500 --> 03:03:54,333
well what you're doing and what happened
and what went wrong and where were you 

4007
03:03:57,350 --> 03:03:58,183
to and

4008
03:03:58,370 --> 03:03:59,360
just look,
Damn.

4009
03:03:59,630 --> 03:04:04,630
The fucking stress of trying to be a 
professional comic is it fucks.

4010
03:04:05,661 --> 03:04:09,650
You know how I know it fucks you?
Because it fucks me every two years,

4011
03:04:09,950 --> 03:04:10,783
every two years when I abandoned my act 
and put out a special and I'd have to 

4012
03:04:13,761 --> 03:04:16,100
write a whole new one and a goddamn 
sweating.

4013
03:04:16,101 --> 03:04:16,934
Just thinking about it right now,
like Thompson girls gone through that 

4014
03:04:18,981 --> 03:04:19,671
right now,
our,

4015
03:04:19,671 --> 03:04:21,230
he's going through that right now.
That's,

4016
03:04:21,410 --> 03:04:24,440
that's the shedding of,
of all you've got.

4017
03:04:24,830 --> 03:04:28,070
And then you've got to start from 
scratch to fucking terrifying again.

4018
03:04:28,071 --> 03:04:30,590
And that's the thing that makes you keep
growing.

4019
03:04:30,790 --> 03:04:33,260
The thing that makes you keep growing.
But when you're,

4020
03:04:33,490 --> 03:04:34,323
when you haven't had any success,
like when you were in the beginning of 

4021
03:04:36,921 --> 03:04:38,840
your career and it just hadn't happened 
yet,

4022
03:04:38,841 --> 03:04:40,820
you're like,
you don't really believe it can happen.

4023
03:04:41,270 --> 03:04:43,940
But once you do have it happen,
then you go,

4024
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:45,440
oh,
I see.

4025
03:04:45,560 --> 03:04:46,570
Just gotta get through that

4026
03:04:46,800 --> 03:04:47,633
dude.
The thing you're talking about with the 

4027
03:04:49,380 --> 03:04:50,190
comedy,
it's,

4028
03:04:50,190 --> 03:04:53,370
it applies to everything.
And it's like the,

4029
03:04:53,660 --> 03:04:56,700
it's because what you're talking about,
someone's always telling me,

4030
03:04:56,701 --> 03:05:01,050
like if a snake doesn't successfully 
shed its skin,

4031
03:05:01,500 --> 03:05:03,300
it dies.
And,

4032
03:05:03,330 --> 03:05:04,230
and,
and that,

4033
03:05:04,620 --> 03:05:05,453
so a person is the same way in the sense
that many of us clean to ways that we 

4034
03:05:12,391 --> 03:05:16,380
were thinking,
that's who we still are when we're not.

4035
03:05:16,530 --> 03:05:17,291
Yeah.
And,

4036
03:05:17,291 --> 03:05:18,124
and,
and you have to learn what parts of 

4037
03:05:20,821 --> 03:05:22,920
yourself you to let go of,
like,

4038
03:05:23,100 --> 03:05:25,740
and you have to have the guts to fucking
let go of it.

4039
03:05:26,070 --> 03:05:29,850
And Dude,
that is one of the craziest things.

4040
03:05:29,851 --> 03:05:33,930
When you really have a thing that you've
become attached to,

4041
03:05:34,360 --> 03:05:36,810
for a lot of people,
it's a relationship that sucks.

4042
03:05:36,811 --> 03:05:40,500
You end up in a bad relationship,
bad job.

4043
03:05:40,770 --> 03:05:45,000
You end up just come attached to some 
version of yourself that you just aren't

4044
03:05:45,001 --> 03:05:45,390
anymore.

4045
03:05:45,390 --> 03:05:46,800
That's not who you are,
right?

4046
03:05:47,490 --> 03:05:49,590
You got to let go of that.
You got to let go of it.

4047
03:05:49,620 --> 03:05:50,000
And,
and,

4048
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:53,700
and letting go of it is death.
It's a form of death.

4049
03:05:53,730 --> 03:05:57,330
It feels like death.
And so people want to avoid it.

4050
03:05:57,331 --> 03:05:58,164
And what ends up happening is you run 
into people who are just fucking don't 

4051
03:06:01,411 --> 03:06:02,244
even realize,
did their valets covered in bags from 

4052
03:06:06,901 --> 03:06:07,734
all these preview.
They're hoarders and they won't let go 

4053
03:06:09,751 --> 03:06:13,290
of all these things,
all these ways they used to be.

4054
03:06:13,500 --> 03:06:15,330
So that's the,
the,

4055
03:06:15,331 --> 03:06:16,830
the,
the,

4056
03:06:16,950 --> 03:06:20,730
what I,
I've learned is that through this act of

4057
03:06:20,731 --> 03:06:22,980
like scanning the south are looking into
this south,

4058
03:06:23,670 --> 03:06:28,020
you'll find places where you're stuck,
where you're stuck.

4059
03:06:28,021 --> 03:06:29,190
Like for example,
you were saying,

4060
03:06:29,191 --> 03:06:30,570
okay,
I get jealous.

4061
03:06:30,571 --> 03:06:33,120
I was getting jealous of these people.
I was getting jealous.

4062
03:06:33,360 --> 03:06:34,440
Well,
you were stuck there.

4063
03:06:34,440 --> 03:06:36,840
That was the plan.
It wasn't just Joe's worse than that.

4064
03:06:37,140 --> 03:06:39,900
It was a toxic or it was,
I didn't like them.

4065
03:06:40,200 --> 03:06:41,070
Yes.
Mad at them.

4066
03:06:41,100 --> 03:06:42,570
Yeah,
you were stuck.

4067
03:06:42,590 --> 03:06:43,423
Yeah.
And you are attached and you were like 

4068
03:06:44,881 --> 03:06:48,030
in that attachment was making you 
unhappy,

4069
03:06:48,090 --> 03:06:49,110
miserable,
heavy,

4070
03:06:49,200 --> 03:06:50,033
heavy.
The feeling is literally not just that 

4071
03:06:51,721 --> 03:06:52,600
week.
We,

4072
03:06:52,680 --> 03:06:53,513
we felt weak.
Well those were really bothered because 

4073
03:06:54,960 --> 03:06:57,490
all the energy that's being put in,
they carry no,

4074
03:06:57,690 --> 03:06:59,280
in my judgment of myself.
Yeah.

4075
03:06:59,920 --> 03:07:00,541
Yeah.
Not,

4076
03:07:00,541 --> 03:07:01,680
not weak,
like tired,

4077
03:07:01,681 --> 03:07:03,060
like didn't have the energy week.
Like,

4078
03:07:03,090 --> 03:07:04,020
Oh,
you bitch,

4079
03:07:04,560 --> 03:07:06,330
you bitch,
you're just jealous.

4080
03:07:07,680 --> 03:07:09,210
That's you.
That's you now.

4081
03:07:09,770 --> 03:07:11,340
Yeah.
I know man.

4082
03:07:11,341 --> 03:07:12,270
And the,
these are like,

4083
03:07:12,390 --> 03:07:14,880
you know,
like when I'm fuck dude,

4084
03:07:14,881 --> 03:07:18,810
when you get a really bad muscle spasm 
and then you go to a misuse and that,

4085
03:07:18,870 --> 03:07:22,920
that moment when the thing finally gives
way and you're like,

4086
03:07:22,950 --> 03:07:23,783
oh,
that place in your back that hurts so 

4087
03:07:25,531 --> 03:07:28,050
bad suddenly just feels like you're back
again.

4088
03:07:28,470 --> 03:07:29,420
And you're like,
ah.

4089
03:07:29,820 --> 03:07:30,910
Well the,
the,

4090
03:07:30,911 --> 03:07:33,360
uh,
the same thing happens with suffering.

4091
03:07:33,361 --> 03:07:35,610
So the suffering and a lot of people's 
lives,

4092
03:07:35,611 --> 03:07:40,611
they're repeating suffering.
That's a karmic muscle spasm.

4093
03:07:40,920 --> 03:07:42,030
And,
and it's like,

4094
03:07:42,031 --> 03:07:46,590
until you literally push into it and the
same way you get rid of a muscle spasm,

4095
03:07:46,740 --> 03:07:47,573
it fucking hurts man.
Until you like get the blood flow going 

4096
03:07:50,671 --> 03:07:55,671
back into that place and really fucking 
go deep into why do I get jealous?

4097
03:07:56,940 --> 03:07:57,840
You know,
for me,

4098
03:07:58,020 --> 03:08:01,170
the thing I just figured out or that's 
haunted me,

4099
03:08:01,171 --> 03:08:03,360
it's just jealousy in relationships.
It's like,

4100
03:08:03,361 --> 03:08:07,080
why do I do this?
What is this?

4101
03:08:07,290 --> 03:08:09,420
This is just like you're saying it's 
weak.

4102
03:08:09,600 --> 03:08:12,090
It's not a good look.
I don't like it.

4103
03:08:12,091 --> 03:08:13,950
And it's indulgent.
Like while you're doing it,

4104
03:08:13,951 --> 03:08:15,510
you realize it's gross.
Yes.

4105
03:08:15,511 --> 03:08:16,830
And You keep doing it.
Yes.

4106
03:08:16,831 --> 03:08:17,611
And you're like,
oh my God,

4107
03:08:17,611 --> 03:08:18,780
I'm being a bitch and I'm gonna keep 
going.

4108
03:08:19,350 --> 03:08:22,920
You fucking texted him first.
Yes.

4109
03:08:22,980 --> 03:08:23,813
That Joe,
that it's so humiliating and so 

4110
03:08:25,801 --> 03:08:30,150
embarrassing and so fucked up and so 
brutal to the person you're with.

4111
03:08:30,760 --> 03:08:35,760
So like that thing I figured,
I figured out a lat,

4112
03:08:36,270 --> 03:08:37,550
am I say let it go?
Oh,

4113
03:08:37,551 --> 03:08:38,780
it's the illusion.
I don't,

4114
03:08:38,790 --> 03:08:40,920
not putting out there that you can 
conquer,

4115
03:08:40,921 --> 03:08:41,754
you know,
eternally parts of your identity or 

4116
03:08:43,111 --> 03:08:43,944
whatever.
But I've been able to let that go and 

4117
03:08:46,261 --> 03:08:48,450
that feeling of really being able to let
it go,

4118
03:08:49,020 --> 03:08:50,610
wow,
man,

4119
03:08:50,790 --> 03:08:52,410
that's,
to me,

4120
03:08:52,450 --> 03:08:56,190
that's one of those monumental things 
when you can start dropping these things

4121
03:08:56,550 --> 03:08:59,940
and it's different for everybody.
Everybody's got their own fucking muscle

4122
03:08:59,941 --> 03:09:03,150
spasm,
but you'll know what it is.

4123
03:09:03,270 --> 03:09:05,490
You know what,
any people listening to it right now,

4124
03:09:05,491 --> 03:09:08,460
you know what it fucking is.
We are incredibly,

4125
03:09:08,780 --> 03:09:09,710
uh,
so we,

4126
03:09:09,711 --> 03:09:12,570
we are incredibly susceptible to 
patterns incredibly.

4127
03:09:12,570 --> 03:09:13,380
So.
Yeah.

4128
03:09:13,380 --> 03:09:16,320
And if you have a pattern of weakness 
and you accept it over and over again,

4129
03:09:16,890 --> 03:09:20,220
it can define you and you have to be 
really careful that he got it.

4130
03:09:20,250 --> 03:09:20,791
Well,
yeah.

4131
03:09:20,791 --> 03:09:22,680
And but in,
what's the beauty of it though,

4132
03:09:22,710 --> 03:09:26,400
is the very fucking thing that's hurting
you like that.

4133
03:09:27,090 --> 03:09:30,330
It's also simultaneously the thing 
that's like your,

4134
03:09:30,820 --> 03:09:32,820
it's your fuel for improvement.
Yeah.

4135
03:09:32,821 --> 03:09:33,654
It's like you're turning your trap.
This is such a cheesy thing that I 

4136
03:09:36,091 --> 03:09:36,924
thought I said that I'm,
that I'm never going to like make it a 

4137
03:09:38,371 --> 03:09:39,204
blog post or anything,
so I forget me if I did think about 

4138
03:09:41,101 --> 03:09:41,934
this.
It's turning your trap into a 

4139
03:09:43,081 --> 03:09:46,020
trampoline.
It's like you find this fucking,

4140
03:09:46,021 --> 03:09:47,900
you have a self help speaker.
I need,

4141
03:09:48,010 --> 03:09:48,843
see right now in a theater,
I know that's like a big screen behind 

4142
03:09:52,141 --> 03:09:53,740
you.
It's trying your tread happen.

4143
03:09:57,860 --> 03:09:58,693
I knew that's why he has it.
I deserved to be made fun of for it and 

4144
03:10:00,071 --> 03:10:02,800
I'm not going to ever use that in a book
or in a blog post or anything,

4145
03:10:03,040 --> 03:10:03,873
but I really do like the concept of like
finding the place you're stuck and 

4146
03:10:07,691 --> 03:10:10,900
realizing that that's not a place you 
should avert your eyes from,

4147
03:10:11,170 --> 03:10:14,140
but in fact more than likely that's a 
door,

4148
03:10:14,230 --> 03:10:15,850
right?
That's a fucking door.

4149
03:10:15,880 --> 03:10:16,713
And you can go through that door into a 
whole new existence where you're no 

4150
03:10:20,171 --> 03:10:24,820
longer horrified by yourself and that 
that is really exciting.

4151
03:10:24,821 --> 03:10:27,640
It's really fucking wonderful moment.
You know,

4152
03:10:27,641 --> 03:10:30,310
not just in comedy,
but I think in anything

4153
03:10:30,410 --> 03:10:32,390
it's always a powerful thing to improve.
It's a,

4154
03:10:32,410 --> 03:10:33,243
that's one of the things that's good 
about doing things that you're not good 

4155
03:10:35,091 --> 03:10:35,924
at.
Um,

4156
03:10:36,050 --> 03:10:36,883
is it,
you get the opportunity to see what 

4157
03:10:38,391 --> 03:10:41,090
happens when you work at something and 
then you improve.

4158
03:10:41,420 --> 03:10:45,620
And I think that applies to everything.
I think if you learn how to play a game,

4159
03:10:45,621 --> 03:10:49,040
you get really good at a game.
I think that figuring things out in your

4160
03:10:49,041 --> 03:10:52,280
mind how to get good at this game 
applies to life.

4161
03:10:52,310 --> 03:10:53,143
I think there's a,
you could get caught up in a game where 

4162
03:10:55,491 --> 03:10:58,610
like chess or whatever it is becomes 
your whole life and then it's almost too

4163
03:10:58,611 --> 03:10:59,480
much.
Right?

4164
03:10:59,660 --> 03:11:02,980
But you can also use things like chess 
or a lot of different things.

4165
03:11:02,990 --> 03:11:03,823
Like we have,
people have a heavy prejudice against 

4166
03:11:05,211 --> 03:11:07,010
video games,
but this,

4167
03:11:07,011 --> 03:11:07,844
it's been absolutely proven that video 
games can enhance many aspects of the 

4168
03:11:11,181 --> 03:11:12,530
way people think and problem solve.

4169
03:11:12,830 --> 03:11:15,410
It's been proven.
I mean there's studies don't doing that.

4170
03:11:15,411 --> 03:11:16,244
People are doing on it,
but we associate video games with 

4171
03:11:19,850 --> 03:11:24,120
wasting time slacking off being a loser.
Mimo.

4172
03:11:24,350 --> 03:11:25,183
Jamie,
what the fuck were you just telling me 

4173
03:11:26,361 --> 03:11:29,140
the other day about how much money these
guys make when they're playing twitch?

4174
03:11:29,160 --> 03:11:30,800
Yeah.
Thousands of dollars a day,

4175
03:11:30,801 --> 03:11:31,634
if not hundreds of thousands a month.
Hundreds of thousands dollars a month 

4176
03:11:34,461 --> 03:11:38,000
playing fucking video games.
How has being a lawyer better than that?

4177
03:11:38,001 --> 03:11:40,730
You fucking asshole.
Is it about making money?

4178
03:11:41,120 --> 03:11:41,953
What is it about,
cause these twitch guys got you beat 

4179
03:11:43,581 --> 03:11:44,500
fuck face.
Yeah.

4180
03:11:44,540 --> 03:11:48,170
You're out there just making people get 
divorced and raking in the cash.

4181
03:11:48,560 --> 03:11:53,420
This guy is shooting aliens on twitch 
and it's making it way more.

4182
03:11:53,450 --> 03:11:54,530
Yeah,
you're a loser.

4183
03:11:54,630 --> 03:11:55,463
Yeah.

4184
03:11:55,720 --> 03:12:00,720
Private Gucci shoes.
He's got a diamond crusted grow legs and

4185
03:12:02,291 --> 03:12:05,230
he plays video games.
Do you understand how crazy that is?

4186
03:12:05,460 --> 03:12:08,440
You're over there working on family law.
Do you watch twitch?

4187
03:12:08,530 --> 03:12:09,880
No.
See that's the thing,

4188
03:12:09,881 --> 03:12:10,714
man.
You know,

4189
03:12:11,210 --> 03:12:11,780
uh,
things to do,

4190
03:12:11,780 --> 03:12:15,130
but I don't mind God Z.
I play,

4191
03:12:15,160 --> 03:12:16,510
I play a lot of games,
man.

4192
03:12:16,570 --> 03:12:17,890
I only have so much time.
I played,

4193
03:12:17,980 --> 03:12:19,810
I play pool.
I shoot archery,

4194
03:12:19,990 --> 03:12:21,030
dude,
you got to,

4195
03:12:21,070 --> 03:12:21,903
first of all,
you got to watch twitch just for just 

4196
03:12:23,321 --> 03:12:25,960
for the sake of definitely don't.
Just so you know,

4197
03:12:25,961 --> 03:12:27,970
for the podcast,
you don't have to,

4198
03:12:28,330 --> 03:12:31,330
but you need to look to that.
You could see the how one,

4199
03:12:31,630 --> 03:12:34,060
how it sounds when you hear about it.
I remember when I first heard about it,

4200
03:12:34,061 --> 03:12:35,860
I'm like that there's an unseen mighty 
mouse.

4201
03:12:35,861 --> 03:12:37,870
Do it.
It's really entertaining.

4202
03:12:37,900 --> 03:12:40,990
Yeah.
And it's really funny and it's like when

4203
03:12:40,991 --> 03:12:41,824
you're looking at like the,
the community that forms around these 

4204
03:12:44,561 --> 03:12:46,720
people and like,
then you realize like,

4205
03:12:46,721 --> 03:12:47,554
man,
there really is something really 

4206
03:12:48,221 --> 03:12:50,950
soothing and addictive about watching.

4207
03:12:51,260 --> 03:12:53,000
Dude.
Have you seen that twitch guy who trolls

4208
03:12:53,001 --> 03:12:55,310
people and uh,
what's it called?

4209
03:12:55,490 --> 03:12:58,220
My space that,
what's that world where,

4210
03:12:58,700 --> 03:12:59,221
what?
No,

4211
03:12:59,221 --> 03:13:01,700
no,
it's chuck not vr chat.

4212
03:13:01,701 --> 03:13:02,534
There's this dude goes into different 
video games playing a character and 

4213
03:13:07,101 --> 03:13:12,101
trolls people inside the games and it's 
some of the funniest fucking shit you've

4214
03:13:12,260 --> 03:13:14,960
ever seen.
Like he goes into what second life?

4215
03:13:14,961 --> 03:13:18,740
He goes into second life somehow makes 
it into a,

4216
03:13:18,980 --> 03:13:23,660
like a enclave of people playing the 
part of bikers in there.

4217
03:13:24,230 --> 03:13:27,380
And he goes in there and they're like,
they're acting like bikers.

4218
03:13:27,381 --> 03:13:28,850
So they're like,
how'd you get in here?

4219
03:13:29,210 --> 03:13:29,871
And he's like,
I don't know,

4220
03:13:29,871 --> 03:13:30,291
I'm just,
you know,

4221
03:13:30,291 --> 03:13:30,981
I'm here.
He's like,

4222
03:13:30,981 --> 03:13:34,040
dad has this very calm voice that like,
you need to get out of here.

4223
03:13:34,280 --> 03:13:35,030
And he's like,
I just,

4224
03:13:35,030 --> 03:13:35,870
I,
you know,

4225
03:13:35,871 --> 03:13:36,740
I,
I'll come,

4226
03:13:36,741 --> 03:13:38,510
I'm going to go,
but I'll be back tomorrow.

4227
03:13:38,510 --> 03:13:39,410
And they're like,
no,

4228
03:13:39,411 --> 03:13:42,380
you will not be back here tomorrow.
You are not coming back.

4229
03:13:42,381 --> 03:13:44,720
This is our place.
Or you had to show that.

4230
03:13:44,721 --> 03:13:45,554
Can you show that on?
I was looking up second life isn't 

4231
03:13:46,940 --> 03:13:49,190
allowed on twitch for some reason,
but this,

4232
03:13:49,191 --> 03:13:52,490
it's a streamer.
Look up second life are,

4233
03:13:52,491 --> 03:13:54,230
this is our place.
I don't know if you can,

4234
03:13:54,260 --> 03:13:56,280
if you'll even be able to find it.
So our play suit,

4235
03:13:56,570 --> 03:13:59,550
it is the funniest shit.
So there's a video that he recorded.

4236
03:13:59,570 --> 03:14:02,540
Then you put it online so people would 
watch it and he trolls.

4237
03:14:02,630 --> 03:14:04,830
Shit.
Tons of people this way man.

4238
03:14:05,150 --> 03:14:08,750
If you find it,
I found a video says extreme angry,

4239
03:14:09,500 --> 03:14:12,020
extreme angry ranger for a hell.
Hilarious.

4240
03:14:12,021 --> 03:14:13,870
Trolling that.
Probably a second life.

4241
03:14:13,880 --> 03:14:15,260
Three fingers.
What can I see it?

4242
03:14:16,700 --> 03:14:19,960
I'll know what it is right away.
That's a theme.

4243
03:14:20,270 --> 03:14:21,170
I think it's probably him.

4244
03:14:21,170 --> 03:14:24,200
But go back and look up.
This is our place biker.

4245
03:14:24,280 --> 03:14:25,113
Second life troll and maybe someone on 
twitter can help us find it cause it's 

4246
03:14:27,891 --> 03:14:28,724
like a pretty famous troll video.
But it's like the funniest fucking shit 

4247
03:14:32,991 --> 03:14:34,670
man.
Like I've watched it a million times.

4248
03:14:34,880 --> 03:14:35,713
I'm looking on twitter right now to see 
was there ever trolling before the 

4249
03:14:38,871 --> 03:14:41,630
Internet?
This is it dude.

4250
03:14:41,631 --> 03:14:43,310
I think.
I think that's it man.

4251
03:14:43,311 --> 03:14:48,311
Second life will shut her down and I 
will speak to me.

4252
03:14:53,030 --> 03:14:56,270
It's one of them.
What's the one?

4253
03:14:56,450 --> 03:14:59,420
So she's talking you have a different 
one.

4254
03:14:59,421 --> 03:15:01,460
What's the one in that yet as a second 
life.

4255
03:15:04,130 --> 03:15:05,090
Hold on.
What's that one?

4256
03:15:05,091 --> 03:15:07,760
You going to come to a fucking MC 
motorcycle club.

4257
03:15:07,790 --> 03:15:08,660
He's using.
Yeah.

4258
03:15:08,840 --> 03:15:13,840
Abbreviation.
I have a reputation that precedes me.

4259
03:15:14,420 --> 03:15:17,480
You can go anywhere and you can mention 
my name.

4260
03:15:19,280 --> 03:15:21,930
Why am I am famous?
You know what?

4261
03:15:22,250 --> 03:15:26,950
Because Heights,
people that be like,

4262
03:15:26,960 --> 03:15:29,480
that's not him.
That's amazing though.

4263
03:15:29,510 --> 03:15:32,660
What's the one in the lower and the 
first suggestion right there.

4264
03:15:32,710 --> 03:15:35,030
I was hooked already now that,
anyway,

4265
03:15:35,031 --> 03:15:39,200
the point is watching video games is a,
is a fucking blast.

4266
03:15:39,230 --> 03:15:40,750
I wish I could finesse.
It's weird.

4267
03:15:40,751 --> 03:15:42,470
Look,
watching games is a blast.

4268
03:15:42,471 --> 03:15:44,150
I like watching.
That's that guy.

4269
03:15:44,180 --> 03:15:46,140
The doctor disrespect.
Yeah.

4270
03:15:47,170 --> 03:15:49,250
Um,
there's like,

4271
03:15:49,650 --> 03:15:50,190
there's a lot

4272
03:15:50,190 --> 03:15:52,470
of things that's interesting.
I like watching people play pool.

4273
03:15:52,530 --> 03:15:53,370
I do,
right.

4274
03:15:53,430 --> 03:15:54,263
I don't even play golf.
And I like watching people play golf 

4275
03:15:56,190 --> 03:15:58,290
because they talking or should I do,
what should I do?

4276
03:15:58,440 --> 03:15:59,580
Like things going to make it.
Yeah.

4277
03:15:59,581 --> 03:16:01,080
I think he's going to fuck up looking at
me.

4278
03:16:01,090 --> 03:16:02,190
Sweating.
Yes.

4279
03:16:02,430 --> 03:16:03,560
It's fun.
Yeah,

4280
03:16:03,610 --> 03:16:04,443
it's fine.
The thing about video games is you can 

4281
03:16:06,031 --> 03:16:08,640
do it from the first person so you can 
look at it from their perspective.

4282
03:16:08,860 --> 03:16:11,320
Yeah.
And it's fucking crazy to watch me.

4283
03:16:11,350 --> 03:16:13,550
I went to,
I went to the um,

4284
03:16:13,660 --> 03:16:14,680
Blizzcon,
you know,

4285
03:16:14,681 --> 03:16:17,940
blizzard has the Blizz con like,
like I,

4286
03:16:17,950 --> 03:16:19,610
I was lucky enough to get in there,
man.

4287
03:16:19,611 --> 03:16:24,611
And I got to watch like a East sports.
I got to watch people playing star craft

4288
03:16:25,511 --> 03:16:26,344
and an auditorium and it was awesome and
the energy and there was so fucking 

4289
03:16:32,351 --> 03:16:33,460
intense.
People were there,

4290
03:16:34,030 --> 03:16:35,440
I don't know,
hundreds,

4291
03:16:35,440 --> 03:16:36,460
hundreds.
It was like shit,

4292
03:16:36,461 --> 03:16:39,550
tons man.
These are like famous players do it.

4293
03:16:39,551 --> 03:16:40,384
These are like world renowned Korean 
fucking star craft masters in like when 

4294
03:16:45,161 --> 03:16:48,820
they're there and if you know anything 
about starcraft and you see what they're

4295
03:16:48,821 --> 03:16:50,710
doing,
it's incredible.

4296
03:16:50,711 --> 03:16:52,840
And it's just like,
you know the applause,

4297
03:16:52,900 --> 03:16:54,250
the fucking like people are like,

4298
03:16:54,980 --> 03:16:57,740
well it's super complex.
So fun to watch.

4299
03:16:57,741 --> 03:16:58,574
That's what I'm talking about.
What this people that have these 

4300
03:16:59,541 --> 03:17:02,660
prejudices about video games,
there's super like video games,

4301
03:17:02,661 --> 03:17:05,270
especially like starcraft.
They are super complex.

4302
03:17:05,271 --> 03:17:07,760
They require a multilevel thinking.
Oh yeah.

4303
03:17:08,240 --> 03:17:09,320
Oh yeah,
you can't fuck,

4304
03:17:09,321 --> 03:17:12,500
you can't just play star craft.
Not against those guys.

4305
03:17:12,501 --> 03:17:14,240
I mean I've seen you play it for two and
I'm like,

4306
03:17:14,241 --> 03:17:16,730
what are you doing?
And moving shit around like what are you

4307
03:17:16,731 --> 03:17:17,181
doing?
Like Oh,

4308
03:17:17,181 --> 03:17:18,580
I'm setting this up and this is for 
later.

4309
03:17:18,600 --> 03:17:19,670
Like what?
I know,

4310
03:17:19,700 --> 03:17:20,533
like what is this

4311
03:17:21,300 --> 03:17:25,080
tried to return to it.
Talk about like feeling old.

4312
03:17:25,320 --> 03:17:26,153
Go back to try to play starcraft after a
couple of expansions of come out and 

4313
03:17:29,191 --> 03:17:30,480
you're just like,
I can't,

4314
03:17:30,960 --> 03:17:33,450
what the fuck man,
I have to learn.

4315
03:17:33,540 --> 03:17:34,373
You don't have that kind of time.
I don't have that kind of time to like 

4316
03:17:36,500 --> 03:17:38,610
learn how to do fucking [inaudible]

4317
03:17:38,870 --> 03:17:39,920
is again,
I don't want to be,

4318
03:17:39,921 --> 03:17:41,600
I liked,
oh my God,

4319
03:17:41,840 --> 03:17:42,673
this is that like the o two arena.
It looks at opening ceremonies and soul 

4320
03:17:45,021 --> 03:17:47,720
for 2014 legal legends.
Oh Wow.

4321
03:17:47,930 --> 03:17:49,670
God,
it's a football stadium.

4322
03:17:49,700 --> 03:17:52,460
Yeah.
It's like a giant soccer stadium so bad.

4323
03:17:52,580 --> 03:17:55,220
Oh my God.
It's filled with people.

4324
03:17:55,221 --> 03:17:56,990
That's like 50,000
people there.

4325
03:17:57,050 --> 03:17:59,120
Yeah.
That's cool man.

4326
03:17:59,150 --> 03:18:01,910
That's insane.
It's so big in Korea.

4327
03:18:01,960 --> 03:18:04,550
Huh?
Holy Shit Dude.

4328
03:18:04,670 --> 03:18:07,700
All those people look at the size of the
police too.

4329
03:18:07,940 --> 03:18:12,320
Why isn't that caught on like that here?
There's what overwatch league,

4330
03:18:12,321 --> 03:18:14,330
they just started this week or this 
month.

4331
03:18:14,331 --> 03:18:15,440
That's in the,
in Burbank.

4332
03:18:15,441 --> 03:18:17,320
I liked the old Johnny Carson theater.
Oh sure.

4333
03:18:17,440 --> 03:18:19,130
Yeah.
That's cool dude.

4334
03:18:19,131 --> 03:18:20,110
When I was,
uh,

4335
03:18:20,150 --> 03:18:20,983
addicted to quake,
I would watch demos all the time from 

4336
03:18:23,661 --> 03:18:27,860
this guy named thresh.
See if you could fine thresh quake.

4337
03:18:28,100 --> 03:18:30,410
There was this kid,
God,

4338
03:18:30,411 --> 03:18:31,640
I wish I remembered his name.

4339
03:18:31,670 --> 03:18:33,530
I think his last name was falling tennis
fong.

4340
03:18:33,531 --> 03:18:34,520
There it is.
Dennis Fong,

4341
03:18:34,590 --> 03:18:35,423
he was the best.
And while he was playing before he 

4342
03:18:37,611 --> 03:18:38,720
retired,
he was the best.

4343
03:18:38,721 --> 03:18:39,554
Like he was so good that people would 
watch his demos and try to emulate his 

4344
03:18:43,401 --> 03:18:45,710
moves.
And what he would do was he would figure

4345
03:18:45,711 --> 03:18:46,544
out a map like absolutely.
So He'd have these one on one duels and 

4346
03:18:49,781 --> 03:18:50,614
this is another thing that's 
surprisingly complex is playing duals 

4347
03:18:54,251 --> 03:18:55,084
in.
This is quake one that we're looking at 

4348
03:18:56,231 --> 03:18:57,370
here.
Oh No it's not.

4349
03:18:57,371 --> 03:18:58,630
It looks like quick three.
Hold on.

4350
03:18:58,631 --> 03:18:59,650
Quick one tournament.
This,

4351
03:18:59,651 --> 03:19:01,720
it goes at a new version of it.
Oh No,

4352
03:19:01,721 --> 03:19:03,310
it's definitely quick one.
Okay.

4353
03:19:03,490 --> 03:19:04,323
So there,
cause you see the shotgun shells and 

4354
03:19:05,621 --> 03:19:06,800
shit like that.
There's all different stuff.

4355
03:19:06,801 --> 03:19:10,030
There's rocket launchers and this didn't
have a rail gun.

4356
03:19:10,031 --> 03:19:12,640
The rail gun changed a lot of shit and 
quake two.

4357
03:19:12,640 --> 03:19:13,473
But the point being that you would have 
these strategies because you had a map 

4358
03:19:17,110 --> 03:19:19,690
and it would all be about controlling 
the response.

4359
03:19:19,720 --> 03:19:20,553
So all of the items,
well it's a rocket launcher or shotgun 

4360
03:19:22,811 --> 03:19:24,160
or whatever the fuck it is that you're 
picking up.

4361
03:19:24,490 --> 03:19:25,480
And the,
the Ammo,

4362
03:19:25,481 --> 03:19:28,060
all of it would respond as well as the 
health.

4363
03:19:28,210 --> 03:19:31,330
So it was all about controlling where 
the respawn is,

4364
03:19:31,331 --> 03:19:32,164
keeping your health up really high and 
then making sure your opponent never 

4365
03:19:34,931 --> 03:19:37,150
gets any good weapons.
And so they would,

4366
03:19:37,300 --> 03:19:40,360
it was really strategic and they chase 
each other around the map.

4367
03:19:41,080 --> 03:19:44,050
This one dude just fucked everybody up.
I mean,

4368
03:19:44,051 --> 03:19:45,490
and he lost a couple of times too when 
he was,

4369
03:19:45,600 --> 03:19:46,510
you know,
starting out.

4370
03:19:46,511 --> 03:19:50,110
But he eventually got to a point where 
he was like the Michael,

4371
03:19:50,111 --> 03:19:51,130
like the right there,
boom.

4372
03:19:51,131 --> 03:19:51,701
He's,
he's that guy.

4373
03:19:51,701 --> 03:19:52,600
Boom Jackson.

4374
03:19:53,020 --> 03:19:56,140
He knows where you're going.
He's firing rockets down hallways.

4375
03:19:56,141 --> 03:20:00,370
He anticipates you're going to be going 
down and when you would watch these guys

4376
03:20:00,371 --> 03:20:01,930
play it.
See like right there,

4377
03:20:01,931 --> 03:20:03,970
that guy was there and he's just waiting
for him.

4378
03:20:03,971 --> 03:20:05,260
Boom,
boom.

4379
03:20:05,620 --> 03:20:06,453
And he just killed the dude.
And I would watch these guys in these 

4380
03:20:09,401 --> 03:20:12,430
demos and try to learn from like how 
they were maneuvering.

4381
03:20:12,460 --> 03:20:13,293
There's another guy called fatality and 
he was really good at it and there was 

4382
03:20:17,231 --> 03:20:18,820
different games that guys would play 
too.

4383
03:20:18,821 --> 03:20:19,654
There was this game and some guys went 
over to unreal and they played unreal 

4384
03:20:22,181 --> 03:20:23,014
tournament.
It's got the armor st every time it 

4385
03:20:25,091 --> 03:20:25,924
responds,
he's going to be running back there to 

4386
03:20:26,621 --> 03:20:29,140
get that armor running back there to get
the shotgun shells,

4387
03:20:29,141 --> 03:20:29,974
making sure that his opponent doesn't 
have a rocket and you just keep killing 

4388
03:20:32,321 --> 03:20:33,154
them.
And then when he responds he chased him 

4389
03:20:34,211 --> 03:20:36,120
down,
kill him again or weaken them.

4390
03:20:36,130 --> 03:20:40,660
And then these are fucking really 
complex multilevel games.

4391
03:20:40,661 --> 03:20:41,494
You have to think in advance and you 
have to plan things out and guys would 

4392
03:20:44,621 --> 03:20:45,454
even have timed things that they would 
put in a program so that it would show 

4393
03:20:49,871 --> 03:20:50,704
on their screen.
Rocket launcher responding and 10 

4394
03:20:52,901 --> 03:20:54,610
seconds,
nine Aa.

4395
03:20:55,210 --> 03:20:56,350
Yeah.
Yeah.

4396
03:20:56,650 --> 03:21:00,490
It's crazy how when this came out,
it was so bad ass.

4397
03:21:01,000 --> 03:21:03,310
And now it looks so ancient.
It looks weird.

4398
03:21:03,311 --> 03:21:04,570
But,
but go to quick.

4399
03:21:04,780 --> 03:21:05,613
What does the quake for one,
what does the new quake one quick 

4400
03:21:08,020 --> 03:21:08,890
tournament,
what does it?

4401
03:21:08,891 --> 03:21:11,590
Quake champions and the,
it's called quake champions.

4402
03:21:12,010 --> 03:21:15,790
There's one you could play online now.
I think it's called quake champions.

4403
03:21:18,010 --> 03:21:19,180
Oh.
Came out last year.

4404
03:21:19,300 --> 03:21:23,170
Now Watch this shit arena.
That's what it is.

4405
03:21:23,200 --> 03:21:25,600
Quake champions arena.
Is that it?

4406
03:21:26,050 --> 03:21:29,710
But look at the fucking graphics now.
But it's the same kind of concept,

4407
03:21:29,750 --> 03:21:31,840
right?
So you know this,

4408
03:21:31,960 --> 03:21:36,940
this guy is playing a one on one against
someone and there's these crazy maps.

4409
03:21:36,941 --> 03:21:40,750
Looks bad ass at was the last time you 
played quake forever.

4410
03:21:40,780 --> 03:21:41,613
Dude,
I'm terrified.

4411
03:21:43,410 --> 03:21:47,150
No daddy got problems.
Like you're like,

4412
03:21:47,151 --> 03:21:48,770
watch.
I'm feel crazy dude.

4413
03:21:48,771 --> 03:21:51,470
I'm telling you I can't do this.
I used to play this shit for eight,

4414
03:21:51,471 --> 03:21:52,304
10 hours a day.
I told you I got a t one line stolen my 

4415
03:21:55,330 --> 03:21:58,900
fucking house at is so fucking funny 
though.

4416
03:21:58,901 --> 03:22:01,370
Just nailed him with a real gun.
Yeah,

4417
03:22:01,390 --> 03:22:02,540
I was.
I had a real problem.

4418
03:22:02,750 --> 03:22:03,583
So,
uh,

4419
03:22:03,740 --> 03:22:05,000
I prefer,
uh,

4420
03:22:05,330 --> 03:22:08,240
archery and a bunch of other things that
I get addicted to,

4421
03:22:08,241 --> 03:22:11,120
but I could easily get addicted to this 
again.

4422
03:22:11,180 --> 03:22:13,280
Yeah.
Is so fun.

4423
03:22:13,340 --> 03:22:15,790
Look super shooters.
What?

4424
03:22:15,870 --> 03:22:16,100
Oh,
you,

4425
03:22:16,100 --> 03:22:17,470
but you don't,
you just don't play them.

4426
03:22:17,560 --> 03:22:17,960
Right.
Listen,

4427
03:22:17,960 --> 03:22:20,360
if we decided to do that,
would you come and play it here?

4428
03:22:20,420 --> 03:22:20,871
Yeah,
of course.

4429
03:22:20,871 --> 03:22:21,704
Okay.
What we're thinking about doing is we 

4430
03:22:23,091 --> 03:22:25,970
have a conference room that I'm thinking
about turning to a land party room.

4431
03:22:26,120 --> 03:22:26,953
Oh,
cool.

4432
03:22:27,080 --> 03:22:27,913
And have it set up.
We'll set up a quick games and then 

4433
03:22:30,561 --> 03:22:31,310
we'll,
uh,

4434
03:22:31,310 --> 03:22:34,910
maybe we'd host a server and let a 
certain amount of people online.

4435
03:22:34,940 --> 03:22:35,773
Yeah.
And then we could have what you call 

4436
03:22:36,180 --> 03:22:37,013
deathmatch outcome with death matches.
Like you have 10 people on a map and 

4437
03:22:39,540 --> 03:22:42,230
they're all just going crazy and you 
respond with all your shit.

4438
03:22:42,460 --> 03:22:44,600
Just do that.
But what about,

4439
03:22:44,601 --> 03:22:46,310
why don't we pick up a new one like 
this,

4440
03:22:46,311 --> 03:22:50,690
this fucking game in this game.
[inaudible] battlegrounds.

4441
03:22:51,350 --> 03:22:52,230
Battlegrounds.
Yeah.

4442
03:22:52,340 --> 03:22:53,860
Man,
this is probably bad at,

4443
03:22:53,870 --> 03:22:55,130
I don't want real physics.

4444
03:22:55,160 --> 03:22:57,110
I don't want to move around like are 
moving around in real life.

4445
03:22:57,111 --> 03:22:57,944
That's the thing about quake cause you 
move weight quicker than you do in real 

4446
03:22:59,451 --> 03:23:02,410
life.
It's like you're bouncing and jumping.

4447
03:23:02,420 --> 03:23:04,490
You're hitting trampolines and flying 
through the air.

4448
03:23:04,500 --> 03:23:06,350
Oh Man,
this thing looks pretty cool.

4449
03:23:06,500 --> 03:23:07,333
If you'll look,
we think you'd like it cause you hunt 

4450
03:23:11,380 --> 03:23:12,213
people.
You're hiring someone else and I'm not 

4451
03:23:13,941 --> 03:23:14,774
even a hundred people bro.
I mean the hunting aliens that can move 

4452
03:23:17,121 --> 03:23:17,954
faster.
The people with rocket launches you 

4453
03:23:18,761 --> 03:23:19,690
didn't buy.
Those are quaker.

4454
03:23:19,730 --> 03:23:21,170
What about hearthstone?
Joe,

4455
03:23:21,171 --> 03:23:22,004
why don't you start playing hearthstone?
You want me to cast spells like you do 

4456
03:23:24,690 --> 03:23:25,523
have to be naked again.
I like overwatch then cause that's a 

4457
03:23:27,381 --> 03:23:28,700
little bit more,
yeah,

4458
03:23:28,701 --> 03:23:31,320
overwatch is.
That's a third person thing.

4459
03:23:32,280 --> 03:23:34,790
This is the one I was explaining the 
overwatch league.

4460
03:23:34,880 --> 03:23:36,140
This is the viewing of it.

4461
03:23:36,170 --> 03:23:37,760
So I specialize.
You can view it,

4462
03:23:38,570 --> 03:23:40,610
but I like watching things through 
someone's eyes.

4463
03:23:40,640 --> 03:23:41,473
That's it.
There you go.

4464
03:23:41,840 --> 03:23:44,570
First person who the Rogers.
Hey this looks great.

4465
03:23:44,600 --> 03:23:45,321
This looks great.
Yeah.

4466
03:23:45,321 --> 03:23:48,320
This is team based.
We should have an overwatch league.

4467
03:23:48,321 --> 03:23:49,154
I suck at it.
You know he's good at it as Pemberton 

4468
03:23:50,721 --> 03:23:51,850
you can get pampered.
Sure.

4469
03:23:52,180 --> 03:23:54,870
Just look at them.
So is this um,

4470
03:23:54,950 --> 03:23:57,470
something that you played with a pc or 
is this an okay,

4471
03:23:57,471 --> 03:23:58,900
I know this one's on all of them.
This one,

4472
03:23:59,440 --> 03:24:00,273
I can't play xbox games.
Once you play with a mouse and a 

4473
03:24:01,821 --> 03:24:02,654
keyboard that controllers just so wide.
They're supposed to be making an update 

4474
03:24:05,901 --> 03:24:06,830
soon.
So you can do that.

4475
03:24:06,831 --> 03:24:09,020
Actually a mouse and keyboard on the 
next box.

4476
03:24:09,080 --> 03:24:11,270
Oh well that's what they should be 
taking.

4477
03:24:11,310 --> 03:24:15,660
So long to do that.
Lizard has said there is so bad ass ears

4478
03:24:15,750 --> 03:24:16,440
ago.

4479
03:24:16,440 --> 03:24:19,460
There's still a thing like an x box has 
said recently they would allow people to

4480
03:24:19,461 --> 03:24:21,740
play,
I guess people on playstation network,

4481
03:24:21,950 --> 03:24:25,940
but Sony doesn't want to play friends 
with them at Sachs.

4482
03:24:26,120 --> 03:24:30,530
Well see the thing about computers is 
when you have a mouse and a keyboard,

4483
03:24:30,531 --> 03:24:32,300
you can just have so much more 
precision.

4484
03:24:32,600 --> 03:24:35,660
Guys get really good.
And they also have like auto aiming.

4485
03:24:35,750 --> 03:24:38,420
It keeps you in the box when you're 
using those.

4486
03:24:38,530 --> 03:24:39,290
They,
the Vicks,

4487
03:24:39,290 --> 03:24:41,750
they've made it a little bit better.
So there's a little hand controllers are

4488
03:24:41,751 --> 03:24:44,430
more accurate than they used be.
But man,

4489
03:24:44,431 --> 03:24:47,160
it ain't the same when you're,
when you have a mouse and keyboard,

4490
03:24:47,161 --> 03:24:47,994
like if you watch that guy google 
fatality in the eye and fatality was a 

4491
03:24:52,831 --> 03:24:53,664
number one.
This guy would hit people with a rail 

4492
03:24:56,161 --> 03:25:00,810
gun in the middle of the air so often it
was almost like he was psychic crazy and

4493
03:25:00,811 --> 03:25:04,350
you'd watch him play and you watch 
through his eyes and you realize how bad

4494
03:25:04,351 --> 03:25:05,184
you are at the game and that was part of
the reason why I got so addictive made 

4495
03:25:07,861 --> 03:25:09,570
it to number one on that new game I was 
talking about.

4496
03:25:09,600 --> 03:25:12,130
He did his twitch channel says right 
here,

4497
03:25:12,140 --> 03:25:13,140
it's not a stream.
Listen play.

4498
03:25:13,500 --> 03:25:14,700
That's him.
He's a savage.

4499
03:25:14,850 --> 03:25:16,620
I met that kid in Vegas.
Very nice car.

4500
03:25:16,920 --> 03:25:17,753
He's not a kid anymore.
I'm sure he's in this deep in his 

4501
03:25:18,960 --> 03:25:19,793
thirties now I think because it's a long
ass time ago that he was running quake 

4502
03:25:23,521 --> 03:25:25,200
unless he was six.
There he is.

4503
03:25:25,230 --> 03:25:26,670
He's a dad.
He's got dad bod,

4504
03:25:27,290 --> 03:25:28,123
got a fucking golf shirt on.
It's dropped his kids off at their 

4505
03:25:31,201 --> 03:25:33,090
fucking out people online.
I love it man.

4506
03:25:33,091 --> 03:25:36,500
If this is like such a better future 
than I predicted when I was a kid,

4507
03:25:36,510 --> 03:25:41,100
like I never imagined that we would be 
able to watch people play video games or

4508
03:25:41,101 --> 03:25:41,934
that,
that you could make a career out of 

4509
03:25:42,841 --> 03:25:43,674
playing not just a career,
but make more in a month than lawyers 

4510
03:25:46,561 --> 03:25:48,590
make any,
had some odd,

4511
03:25:48,890 --> 03:25:51,060
these people were all painting and 
playing music and stuff.

4512
03:25:51,310 --> 03:25:52,143
All right,
we're going to do it and we're going to 

4513
03:25:52,830 --> 03:25:55,170
also do a pool on it,
right.

4514
03:25:55,520 --> 03:25:57,690
It was set that shit.
We got plans,

4515
03:25:57,750 --> 03:26:00,030
techno hunt.
We did this techno hunt thing.

4516
03:26:00,040 --> 03:26:01,790
Have you seen the technol hunt game yet?
Only.

4517
03:26:01,860 --> 03:26:03,960
Are you?
You like posting on an install?

4518
03:26:03,961 --> 03:26:04,794
Yeah,
I want to.

4519
03:26:04,800 --> 03:26:07,110
I want to check it out there.
We have thing live.

4520
03:26:07,111 --> 03:26:07,944
There's 40,000
people watching and we're shooting 

4521
03:26:09,661 --> 03:26:13,740
arrows at this screen and then it's been
downloaded like 300,000

4522
03:26:13,741 --> 03:26:16,800
times in the first 24 hours.
The ETA on this man,

4523
03:26:16,801 --> 03:26:20,830
like when are you going to fully turn 
this into like a video gaming compound?

4524
03:26:20,831 --> 03:26:22,880
Because pretty close,
really exciting and on it.

4525
03:26:23,040 --> 03:26:24,780
We're closing in on,
but the tech doe hunting.

4526
03:26:24,781 --> 03:26:27,060
What's fascinating about that is you use
a regular bow,

4527
03:26:27,270 --> 03:26:29,700
so it's real.
It's like real world practice.

4528
03:26:30,180 --> 03:26:31,470
A compound Ba.
Yeah,

4529
03:26:31,471 --> 03:26:33,000
like a real compound bow.

4530
03:26:33,150 --> 03:26:33,983
Yeah.
You're not supposed to use a powerful 

4531
03:26:34,891 --> 03:26:37,470
one.
Supposed to keep it down to 70 pounds.

4532
03:26:37,471 --> 03:26:40,110
You can't Jack it up.
Like mine is jacked up to 84 pounds.

4533
03:26:40,500 --> 03:26:42,750
But I tried to eat a four pound one that
it didn't break it.

4534
03:26:43,710 --> 03:26:46,890
So we'll see.
I'm excited man.

4535
03:26:46,891 --> 03:26:48,990
I love this compound.
It's crazy to ass.

4536
03:26:48,991 --> 03:26:51,210
Yeah,
I can't wait to see what you do with it.

4537
03:26:51,211 --> 03:26:53,580
It's like you're just barely growing it 
right now,

4538
03:26:53,581 --> 03:26:54,500
right?
Like well,

4539
03:26:54,510 --> 03:26:57,060
any suggestions you have been and if you
want to do something here,

4540
03:26:57,061 --> 03:26:58,840
we could do anything.
You want this.

4541
03:26:58,860 --> 03:27:00,010
If you have an idea,
the,

4542
03:27:00,060 --> 03:27:01,800
I liked the video game idea,
man.

4543
03:27:01,830 --> 03:27:02,663
Let's do it.
The idea of having some kind of like 

4544
03:27:03,391 --> 03:27:06,990
twitch laboratory here is pretty cool.
That's exciting.

4545
03:27:07,050 --> 03:27:09,540
Let's do it.
So you heard it folks,

4546
03:27:09,960 --> 03:27:12,600
Duncan trussell's in for the twitch 
league.

4547
03:27:12,890 --> 03:27:14,600
Don Don,
I suck at these games.

4548
03:27:15,570 --> 03:27:17,550
My kids are going to get daddy come 
home.

4549
03:27:17,640 --> 03:27:20,250
God,
Duncan Trussell,

4550
03:27:20,251 --> 03:27:21,084
ladies and gentleman,
you could follow him and his antics on 

4551
03:27:22,561 --> 03:27:24,870
twitter or Instagram,
but you don't use facebook,

4552
03:27:24,880 --> 03:27:25,600
dude.
No,

4553
03:27:25,600 --> 03:27:26,520
no.
There you go.

4554
03:27:27,210 --> 03:27:29,940
Duncan trussell family hour,
one of the best podcasts in the world.

4555
