1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,680
Oh,
like an hour extra and get culinary.

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:02,883
Talking about stuff.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,490
One zero.
The stars have aligned.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:10,383
The prophecy has come true.
Alex Jones and Eddie Bravo together on 

5
00:00:14,471 --> 00:00:16,960
episode nine.
One one.

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,750
This is episode nine slash 11 in the 
podcast.

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:19,841
No,
I'm not.

8
00:00:19,841 --> 00:00:20,674
I had a fucking work hard all week to 
grind out podcast to make sure that I 

9
00:00:24,761 --> 00:00:26,920
hit episode nine slash 11 when we booked
it.

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,360
I knew how I go.
Okay.

11
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,470
There's a certain number of podcast I 
have to do to get this to nine slash 11.

12
00:00:32,471 --> 00:00:34,960
So Jane and I worked it out and we did 
it.

13
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,010
Let me just say I'm very envious because
I'm in my studio under bright lights and

14
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:41,860
I've talked about going back to when I 
was just on radio that darkness,

15
00:00:41,861 --> 00:00:44,500
we can really think this is a wonderful 
studio.

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,370
I'm going to do a studio.
My next one with a fire pit.

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,473
I'm going to have conversations outside.
I've talked to about that because it's 

18
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:53,260
like primitive.

19
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,780
It triggers now and that it's 
comforting.

20
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,820
It feels good and it's kind of cool 
lighting.

21
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,820
So that's the next studio we build.
I'm going to build a fire pit,

22
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,460
going to get some log,
some actual real fire.

23
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,040
You can only do that like certain times 
of the year in la though.

24
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,020
Like when they,
when they have fire season,

25
00:01:08,021 --> 00:01:08,854
they wouldn't let you do that shit.
We will usually have like a little 

26
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:11,434
balcony or like a little outside 
courtyard with your fire pit and you 

27
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,181
Kinda,
you have.

28
00:01:14,181 --> 00:01:16,120
I don't want a real fire pit,
you know,

29
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,880
like I feel like if you're going to have
a fire pit with sharing bonfire,

30
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,013
you should have an actual law.
You should move to Hawaii part of the 

31
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:22,803
year and I will too.
And then we'll just have a big fire in 

32
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,610
the jungle and create a whole 
renaissance.

33
00:01:27,611 --> 00:01:28,920
Just what we're talking Donald Trump.

34
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:34,290
Helicopter secretly.
Secretly he thinks that that could fix a

35
00:01:35,711 --> 00:01:37,780
lot.
We could fix a lot with that.

36
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,320
I was showing you.
You like a decorated a correspondent for

37
00:01:41,321 --> 00:01:42,640
the news.
Now what the fuck's going on?

38
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,810
What do you mean?
I mean,

39
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,630
you're a euro,
euro official White House Guy now,

40
00:01:46,631 --> 00:01:49,990
right?
Like you're actually like a news guy,

41
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,190
like a 100 percent legit.
We'll verify the bureau and stuff,

42
00:01:54,191 --> 00:01:56,640
but that's just part of it,
but like you're,

43
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,830
you're in deep with the trump 
administration.

44
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,993
Well,
I've had trump on and I talked to him 

45
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:02,620
so.
But I mean really.

46
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,580
He's your buddy.
Really,

47
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,443
really.
It's just that we're covering the 

48
00:02:05,861 --> 00:02:09,490
resurgence of America.
What made the country great lower taxes,

49
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,320
empowering the people,
bringing people together.

50
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,393
The opposite of what MSM said.
What's happening is mainstream media is 

51
00:02:16,481 --> 00:02:18,970
literally almost dead.
It's collapsing.

52
00:02:18,971 --> 00:02:19,804
I mean,
look at you.

53
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,700
I remember having dinner with you like 
six,

54
00:02:21,701 --> 00:02:22,870
seven years ago and you're like,
yeah,

55
00:02:22,871 --> 00:02:26,170
we got a million downloads a week.
Now it's $90 million or whatever it is,

56
00:02:26,171 --> 00:02:30,010
a month and 20 million on Youtube.
And for Info wars it's similar numbers.

57
00:02:30,011 --> 00:02:32,140
It's a good week.
Forty dollars million.

58
00:02:32,141 --> 00:02:32,974
We've had as many as 85 million people 
listen on radio and tune into videos in 

59
00:02:36,311 --> 00:02:37,690
one week.
That was election week,

60
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:40,180
but our normal 40 something million.
It's just crazy.

61
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:42,250
How can they compete with that?
They're still delusional.

62
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,260
They advert CNN show is like a million 
viewers.

63
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,000
Fox things.
It's the big swinging deck.

64
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:47,920
It's got $3 million.
It's all,

65
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,903
I'm sorry,
people transmitting and broadcasting to 

66
00:02:50,861 --> 00:02:52,050
geriatric homes,
you know,

67
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,220
where you see Fox News and CNN and 
nursing homes,

68
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,830
you know,
what you see with kids 10 years old,

69
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,980
10 years old at the college and beyond 
the Rogan experience

70
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,080
and it's infowars and it's always other 
folks.

71
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,400
It's amazing.
Yeah,

72
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:04,234
it's a weird time as an NBA teams like 
those shows where you have to tune in 

73
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:09,850
from eight to nine and you have to sit 
through the commercials.

74
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,863
That's kind of all gone away because of 
dvrs because now people will just have 

75
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:15,670
to wait a few minutes.
He could dvr through all the commercials

76
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,130
or you record things after the fact.
I have ever.

77
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:21,460
You'd like 15 years ago saying the 
internet killed television.

78
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,533
They haven't announced that yet.
You Watch it's going to kill it because 

79
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:26,500
how can they compete with what you can 
do on the Internet?

80
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,453
You know,
a guy getting screwed by a horse or 

81
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,393
whatever it is.
How the hell can you compete with all 

82
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:34,330
this craziness?
Did you see the guy in China?

83
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:36,040
They got jacked by the tiger today?
Oh,

84
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,450
I did see that yesterday,
actually it was yesterday.

85
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,473
Let me look,
let me not pick it mission and just go 

86
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:41,201
through here.
Well,

87
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:43,870
they even shot at the tiger.
So the scattered the Tigers,

88
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:45,610
they shot at the Tigers to get them off 
this dude.

89
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,310
And then even after the bullets were 
shot off,

90
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,450
this tiger was like,
no,

91
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,800
fuck that.
I'm going back in.

92
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,670
And he ran in after they shot at him and
finally killed a dude and it was all.

93
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,970
Everybody's got their phone up and 
they're all filming it fell in or jumped

94
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:03,190
in.
He jumped and he wanted to get killed.

95
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,490
Oh really?
Yeah.

96
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,333
He would know this.
That was another guy who went in with a 

97
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:10,300
line and try to convert them to 
Christianity touristy there.

98
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,040
That guy.
It's crazy.

99
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:12,963
Whenever the Bible and he's trying to 
convert the lines line just fucked him 

100
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:16,084
up.
I'll tell you what's crazy about that 

101
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:21,220
though is imagine trying to convert him.

102
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,053
Maybe he was just like praying that the 
motherfucking line when he know he went 

103
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:25,534
in on his own,
he was talking to them in the name of 

104
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:29,020
Jesus and he was like talking to.
You never seen it.

105
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,400
Jamie.
Pull it up.

106
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,600
Definitely.
Probably Schizophrenia.

107
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,120
See,
here he is.

108
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,580
He gets in there and he's.
He's talking to the lines.

109
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,443
This motherfucker just jumped the fence 
and decided he was going to convert the 

110
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:44,760
lines of Christianity and lions are 
apparently like way cooler than tiger.

111
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:45,963
What is going on here?
Tigers see people and they just fucked 

112
00:04:48,691 --> 00:04:51,580
him up immediately.
The line like barely fuck that guy up.

113
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,083
He just kind of slips because they're,
they're more tribal or more like dogs 

114
00:04:56,651 --> 00:05:00,580
pack animal there.
The only cat that a pack or a group.

115
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:02,860
So they're not,
you know as agro.

116
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,660
Exactly.
When a tiger sees you,

117
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:06,010
you're in my territory,
I'm going to kill you.

118
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,590
Yeah.
Tiger is a totally different beast.

119
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,783
Like tiger.
Sometimes they'll like adopt another 

120
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:11,624
little animal,
like a wild dog or something like would 

121
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,124
be licking on it.
Big Knife to it and tell them what to 

122
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,611
say it.
Yeah.

123
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:20,611
The d word stuff,
remember the only way you could see this

124
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:23,740
before is with those animal attack 
videos.

125
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,080
Remember those animals know we started 
the same way.

126
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:26,943
They always start off with a dog attack,
a dog attacking a mailman and Iguanas 

127
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:32,644
out attacked your leg,
and then it slowly ends up with drunk 

128
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:42,121
Mexicans at a Rodeo on a wild bull with 
a rope and those bulls are smart as hell

129
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:45,754
and they drag them these drunk Mexicans 
and they dragged their heads along the 

130
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:52,570
rails and just crushed these dudes in 
between the railing.

131
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:56,300
Like some serious brain trauma.
Yeah,

132
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,010
vicious brain trauma.
They need one

133
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,970
word it with just 100 percent of that 
because that was the most exciting shit.

134
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,853
Alex Jones.
How the fuck is TV getting compete with 

135
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:06,620
that?
So that's what we're saying.

136
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:07,640
Yeah.
They can't compete.

137
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:08,474
So that was kind of wrong though because
Netflix is tv and it's also the 

138
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:13,850
Internet.
It's like both things.

139
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,043
Sure.
It's forcing the power of Hollywood 

140
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,530
basically dispersed though.
Yeah.

141
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,180
Well they.
I mean,

142
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,840
look,
it's,

143
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,520
it's better if it gets.
If,

144
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,580
if the ability to get your workout gets 
to more people.

145
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:26,414
It's better,
it's better if anybody can do like the 

146
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,560
new competition in these new youtube 
stars,

147
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,693
like all they have to do is stand in 
front of a camera and this zero 

148
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:34,430
production value,
they don't have.

149
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,810
I mean,
if you've got a camera,

150
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,790
you've got an Internet connection,
you can have a youtube show.

151
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:38,624
People find you interesting.
All of a sudden you've got millions and 

152
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:41,600
millions of subscribers.

153
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,790
I mean,
Eddie was bringing up this fact for your

154
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,160
audience up front.
A lot of MSM lies and says,

155
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:46,994
I'm this big right wing guy,
but you guys know that I was really 

156
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:49,934
against George w Bush all you where you 
were arrested early on in the Bush 

157
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:54,490
administration.
I remember when,

158
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,483
when we first became friends in 1999,
we were running around the White House 

159
00:06:59,211 --> 00:06:59,961
are the,
uh,

160
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,970
the state capital lawn with,
with,

161
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,610
with George Bush junior and senior masks
on.

162
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,683
And you were always again,
sure the bush supported trump is the 

163
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:12,710
entire power structure of the media.
I mean the Vatican,

164
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,830
the communist Chinese or Saudi Arabians 
all put money in and said,

165
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:16,910
stop him,
stop him.

166
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,893
And then lives that.
The Russians were giving him money with 

167
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:20,024
no proof and so the issue is he's simply
trying to actually be president and not 

168
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:24,104
have special interest in their running 
him and that's why the whole power 

169
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:27,230
structure is against trump.

170
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,390
So Andy was asking before we went live,
well,

171
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:31,460
how is it you're this outside guy 
against the establishment,

172
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:32,540
but now you're for it.
No,

173
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,840
trump's trying to create a beachhead.
You just to explain it,

174
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,943
to try to take the country back and 
actually devolve power back to the 

175
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:41,330
states and back to the people doesn't 
mean he's perfect,

176
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,370
but notice the stock market went up a 
trillion,

177
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:45,110
$200,000,000,000
a year,

178
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,043
just the last month or so because a lot 
of institutional investors and others 

179
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:51,530
understand what trump is trying to 
create real prosperity,

180
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,830
not a bunch of social engineering and 
I'm not here to pitch trump to people.

181
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,933
The issue is is that there were major 
intelligence agencies and and patriots 

182
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:02,520
and the government who were sick of what
was happening and we're sick of,

183
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,780
of of Hillary and Obama backing jihadist
groups,

184
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,623
other things,
and so they're rolling those groups up 

185
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:10,400
right now.
They really are standing up against them

186
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,473
and this is a historic moment and and so
there's been a counter-coup through the 

187
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:18,140
electoral process in our country and 
that's what wikileaks was.

188
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,660
That wasn't the Russians.
That was US intelligence agencies.

189
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,870
I said two months ago that Anthony 
Winter in New York,

190
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,310
you know,
who might have a dean's husband,

191
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:27,710
the former congressman,
a that was working for Hillary.

192
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,530
I said that he's under investigation for
child porn.

193
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,783
Okay.
And then now it came out yesterday that 

194
00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:34,460
they're looking at indicting him for 
child porn.

195
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,950
While I had that from the NYP that came 
out yesterday.

196
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,170
Wow.
Why would,

197
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,430
what did he do?
He had something on his computer.

198
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,630
Well now that they won't tell us,
but I was told that tied into that whole

199
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:46,490
pizzagate thing,
which again,

200
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:48,950
the media misrepresented what we said 
and did.

201
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:52,010
It came out and all those wiki leaks,
all these weird coats.

202
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,083
Okay.
Like there was a bunch of weird codes 

203
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:59,651
about pizza and about a piece of pizza 
and Obama wants $65,000

204
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,860
in hot dogs delivered and they're like,
are these really good hot dogs?

205
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,030
Hot dogs weren't as good last time.
Well,

206
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:08,680
these are succulent on dogs.
That's not about kids.

207
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,560
Do you have to be?
Well,

208
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:12,960
what is that about?
It's male prostitutes.

209
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,430
I mean,
that's what the code means really?

210
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:15,031
Yeah.
Okay.

211
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:15,864
Yes.
How do they get male prostitutes to see 

212
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,810
keep your fucking mouth shut?
Well,

213
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,850
cause you know,
bad things happen if you don't.

214
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,910
Federal Child Porn charges possible for 
Anthony Wiener.

215
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,250
But,
but I'm on record months ago.

216
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,533
I'm on record months ago saying that 
that's the case because I had those 

217
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:31,404
sources and show the government good 
elements of the government know what's 

218
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:35,544
really going on.
So the media that Mesh misrepresented 

219
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,420
and said,
oh look at four Chan,

220
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,480
they're talking about a thing called 
pizzagate and some pizza place in DC and

221
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:43,950
the media looks at it and says,
Oh,

222
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,770
Alex Jones is claiming all this bad 
stuff's happening at this pizza place.

223
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:47,670
I'm like,
what is this?

224
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,773
So they divert some probably innocent 
pizza place to distract off of all the 

225
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:55,590
emails that the New York police have and
the FBI have.

226
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,990
That's just this monstrous reported 
pedophile network.

227
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,943
So to just credit that they could create
a fake story hoping we jump on it to 

228
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:05,040
then divert over to that story and then 
once we're on that,

229
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,690
it diverts everybody off from Anthony 
Wiener,

230
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,050
what hats,
which reportedly,

231
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,960
which leads reportedly to a larger 
network.

232
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,390
So they're playing that far ahead so 
they're,

233
00:10:15,391 --> 00:10:16,224
they're literally attacking a pizza 
place with fake stories just so that 

234
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,930
people can focus on that and take 
attention off.

235
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:22,920
Anthony Wiener.
Yes,

236
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:23,754
because I was connected to that story.
It was connected to Podesta stuff in 

237
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:29,970
deceased or in New York and all this 
other crazy stuff.

238
00:10:29,971 --> 00:10:30,804
So I love saying because we're making a 
lot of like long sentences here and a 

239
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:35,370
lot of long statements,
but let's,

240
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:36,960
let's fear a lot of people that are 
going.

241
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,040
What the fuck is pizza gate?
There was this Ben Swan guy who did this

242
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,950
recent piece about it and a lot of 
people got very angry.

243
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,500
Did you see the piece?
See the piece that he did?

244
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,120
It seemed to me to be pretty measured 
and he was making some connections too,

245
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:54,090
between that little symbol for child 
pedophilia.

246
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,680
Yes.
And uh,

247
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,120
we're just pedophilia era,
right?

248
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,510
And the logo,
the logo for the pizza place,

249
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,523
he also made,
did he make the hastert connection with 

250
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:04,224
Podesta,
pastored a confirmed child molester and 

251
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,930
best buddies would pedesta and former 
speaker of the house.

252
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,420
And then you expand on that.
But let's,

253
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,430
let's just do it step at a time because 
this is really kind of important stuff.

254
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,320
So that's all 100 percent true.
Right?

255
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,443
So it's true that hastert it's in jail.
It's true that hastert is a known 

256
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:22,920
pedophile that a judge called a serial 
pedophile,

257
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:23,270
right?

258
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,103
Yeah,
that's true.

259
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,800
Is One hundred percent.
It's true.

260
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:28,410
The Podesta was friends with hastert.
That's 100 percent,

261
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,370
right?
Yes.

262
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,280
And then all this other stuff now 
becomes odd,

263
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,690
doesn't it become odd?
And,

264
00:11:33,691 --> 00:11:36,210
but if you say it's odd,
if you look at it,

265
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,223
this bents one guy with this,
what I thought was he was just kind of 

266
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,970
expressing what is weird about this 
case.

267
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,650
And when he did it,
he got so much shit over it.

268
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,493
I was kind of shocked.
I was kinda shocked people were calling 

269
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,850
him a moron and the same thing.
But,

270
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:52,620
but that's what I'm saying,
they build a straw man.

271
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,653
So imagine thousands of emails come out 
with them talking about we'll have the 

272
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:58,420
kids ready.
Six,

273
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:00,610
seven and eight in the hot tub at this 
time.

274
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,740
And there didn't see anything like that.
Oh,

275
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:03,790
it gets.
It gets really weird.

276
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,920
Where did it say that it was in the 
emails?

277
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,833
There's thousands of them,
but it said we'll get the kids in the 

278
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:10,350
hot tub.
Yes.

279
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,190
I never saw that.
Can you?

280
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,420
Can you see if you could find that to 
me?

281
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,990
That seems like just the whole thing is 
so bizarre.

282
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:18,850
It's like we're going to have the kids 
delivered for entertainment.

283
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:21,250
There'll be in the hot tub now.
These are great kids,

284
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:24,160
but kids can be kids.
We know what's fucked up about it is how

285
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:26,950
few people really mentioned that 
connection to hastert.

286
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:29,500
I always thought that would be a huge,
huge,

287
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:33,850
constant Jonah love the fact that there 
are very astute.

288
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,880
I just bring up this whole big topic of 
how they twist things.

289
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,660
You go right to the key points that,
okay,

290
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,213
Barney frank,
who got caught running a underage male 

291
00:12:45,911 --> 00:12:50,911
prostitute ring in the nineties out of 
his three story townhouse,

292
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:52,384
you.
I thought it was just a male prostitute 

293
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:53,170
thing.

294
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:56,420
I didn't know somewhere and then,
but listen,

295
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,670
I was with them all the way up to age 19
plus or whatever,

296
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,800
but then what happened is he goes on 
Cspan on the house floor and says,

297
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,040
if you continue to investigate this,
I'm going to expose the half of you that

298
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,750
are involved in this,
in this room,

299
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,480
and the investigation got shut down.
So the reason this is important,

300
00:13:13,481 --> 00:13:17,110
as for shadow government,
you need something so bad that everybody

301
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:19,570
who's involved in it ever,
ever comes out will be destroyed.

302
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,583
So that binds them all to the secrecy.
So that's where child pornography comes 

303
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:25,654
in and that's where pedophilia comes in 
and that's where you get so many of the 

304
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:29,230
elite being into it,
but just as you shed,

305
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,220
you have the Republican establishment 
trying to get mastered out of nowhere as

306
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:36,730
a wrestling coach to run for office.

307
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,790
Then reportedly,
he's the pure career.

308
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,633
Just like Penn state and just like they 
had something Dusky Dusky and the under 

309
00:13:43,111 --> 00:13:45,190
age kids,
they were quote mentoring,

310
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,560
getting farmed out to supposedly big 
donors.

311
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,503
What's this is who we're talking about.
Two very specific cases where two very 

312
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:54,010
different cases,
but what's crazy is they're both real.

313
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,300
It's both real 100 percent send Dusky 
who is a very respected man.

314
00:13:58,301 --> 00:13:59,134
The community did a lot of charity work 
with a young disenfranchised children 

315
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:07,750
and was molesting them at the same time 
and was super respected in the community

316
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:10,240
and he was the right hand man to Joe 
Paterno.

317
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,283
So that whole thing just fell apart in 
the headquarters from our research with 

318
00:14:13,691 --> 00:14:15,950
the pedophilia is like Pennsylvania.
Okay.

319
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,220
That's the Franklin cover and that's,
that's,

320
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,440
that's the.
That's up in public.

321
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,170
What does this see?
Jamie says we plan to heat the pool,

322
00:14:23,171 --> 00:14:24,004
so a possibly Bonnie will be uber 
service to transport Ruby Emerson and 

323
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:31,060
Mave Lozado,
11,

324
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,440
nine and almost seven.

325
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,423
So you'll have some further 
entertainment and they will be in that 

326
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:39,040
pool for sure.
What in the fuck?

327
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,890
That's the only one of them.
That's a real confirmed emails.

328
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,860
Yes,
Jesus Christ.

329
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,733
Listen,
here's the problem.

330
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:50,530
So I have in ypd telling me before the 
election,

331
00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:51,800
like a month,
yes,

332
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:55,220
we're investigating wayner child porn 
photos.

333
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,263
Go back to that please.
I want to not just have kids out on the 

334
00:14:58,431 --> 00:14:59,264
Internet but,
but kids he's communicating with and 

335
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:03,350
their parents are basically letting them
communicate with him.

336
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,250
If I'm told this by didn't,
why PD detectives,

337
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,413
I mean the secret service gave me 
information about how hillary was 

338
00:15:10,221 --> 00:15:11,054
collapsing all the time.
Remember we reported that and then it 

339
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,800
got caught on tape.
So,

340
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,210
so show.
All this stuff goes on and on and on.

341
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,190
And so I'm not saying half the people or
or,

342
00:15:20,191 --> 00:15:22,290
or 90 percent of them are,
are,

343
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,560
are,
are guilty or innocent mall.

344
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,130
This all I know is we start covering it,
start asking questions.

345
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,660
They then divert off into somebody on a 
fortune for forum pointing out.

346
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:36,650
There was some email about a meeting at 
some pizza place in DC.

347
00:15:36,651 --> 00:15:37,910
We're top Democrats.
Cow.

348
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,000
They then turned the whole thing into 
I'm blaming some pizza place.

349
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,640
I'm sending shooters into shoot people 
at a pizza place,

350
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,450
makeup all this crazy ass crap when I 
never even said any of that,

351
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,610
and then you go back to me two months 
ago,

352
00:15:49,611 --> 00:15:51,020
three months ago,
I said,

353
00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:51,854
the police have told me they're 
investigating wiener for pedophilia and 

354
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:57,710
child porn when it was not in the news 
now known as it's in the news.

355
00:15:57,711 --> 00:15:58,544
What I'm saying?
Okay,

356
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,160
Elise,
slow down.

357
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:01,950
Before we get away from this,
because I got to go back to that.

358
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:02,803
There was a quote up there that are that
Jamie pull up that I wanted to read the 

359
00:16:05,061 --> 00:16:07,430
one on the lower bottom about this.
Now this,

360
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,443
these are the emails that you were 
talking about and these are 100 percent 

361
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,650
confirmed emails.
Go back to that one.

362
00:16:12,651 --> 00:16:14,970
That was on the bottom.
Scroll down to the.

363
00:16:14,971 --> 00:16:16,730
And I'm not saying any of these people 
are guilty.

364
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:17,564
Yeah.
What is that?

365
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,643
Hold on a second here.
So six grownups with two toddlers and 

366
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:22,994
two infants spread throughout the house 
and sure enough one of the toddlers was 

367
00:16:27,081 --> 00:16:30,680
rubbing my nose at 5:45.
What the fuck does that mean?

368
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:37,950
The FBI as a whole got back to retrieve 
the children they threw in the towel and

369
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:38,903
what?

370
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,693
I don't know,
man.

371
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,703
This is like,
I don't know what the fuck those emails 

372
00:16:44,761 --> 00:16:46,260
mean,
but look,

373
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:51,300
let's just now everybody wants 
immediately shoe this away as disgusting

374
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,293
when possible.
We're talking about two very specific 

375
00:16:56,371 --> 00:16:57,670
proven cases,
right?

376
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,020
Hastert,
proven Sandusky,

377
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:00,923
proven real huge elite,
powerful people that were also active 

378
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:05,580
pedophiles,
right?

379
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,350
Yes.
So that's a fact.

380
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,213
Who Know each other in our bodies and 
then you've got Podesta's brother who's 

381
00:17:11,311 --> 00:17:15,480
big in Washington in an article in 2007 
in the Washington Post.

382
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,250
I'm going to give you the exact 
headline,

383
00:17:17,251 --> 00:17:18,084
which was something like a radical art 
or something and it's like naked photos 

384
00:17:21,751 --> 00:17:22,584
of the neighborhood.
Kids in their house and then they're 

385
00:17:25,141 --> 00:17:27,270
showing it,
throwing it in your face.

386
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:27,880
It's,
it's,

387
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,330
it's just crazy.
But that's not even stuff I get into but

388
00:17:30,331 --> 00:17:31,164
there.
But there is something to that because 

389
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:32,934
some of his artwork was super disturbing
that he had in his house like this pink 

390
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:39,030
buckets.
There were there were in their underwear

391
00:17:39,031 --> 00:17:39,864
and it looked like they had been paddled
and they were all standing there with 

392
00:17:41,701 --> 00:17:44,710
their butts facing very.
It was more about this than others.

393
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,553
See,
and that's all I do is cover these real 

394
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,490
tanks.
Don't give you the new nurse,

395
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,000
but that is real.
The government pissed off about this.

396
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:50,843
The pedophile rings.
We've gotten so big that the 

397
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:52,914
intelligence agencies began to leak all 
this info and I knew Hillary was 

398
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:56,514
planning to steal the election.
She did steal five states according to 

399
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,030
the experts.
And briefly how did she do that?

400
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:02,900
I wouldn't mean trying to break into six
days.

401
00:18:02,901 --> 00:18:03,734
It's not go on these long rants where 
there's a bunch of different statements 

402
00:18:06,391 --> 00:18:09,090
that need to be addressed.
So let's just from right there,

403
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:09,924
you got to get to that.
Like how did she steal five states can 

404
00:18:11,951 --> 00:18:14,230
kind of gloss over that.
Okay.

405
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,300
No,
she tried to.

406
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,850
How did she tried to steal six days?
She did steal five states.

407
00:18:17,851 --> 00:18:20,040
Well,
Bev Harris was a big liberal Democrat at

408
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,870
the Hbo Documentary,
Hacking Democracy.

409
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,013
She's the leading expert.
She was actually a month before the 

410
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:26,484
election through whistleblowers got the 
actual code that had been loaded on 

411
00:18:29,731 --> 00:18:33,560
machines all across the country should 
ever in studio to steal the election.

412
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,613
I saw hacking democracy and I saw that 
they did engineer those voting machines 

413
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,950
that you could have a third party input 
and change it and that it on live on the

414
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:43,590
show.
And that was a decade ago with Bush.

415
00:18:43,591 --> 00:18:44,770
This is new.
Okay.

416
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,770
Just wanted.
She's the top election fraud expert.

417
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,370
So she comes on my show,
uh,

418
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,320
the stories on infowars.com.
And she says,

419
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,120
uh,
we've got evidence.

420
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,983
And then I had the hacking experts on 
and I had the industry whistle blowers 

421
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,374
on and I had the county officials on at 
every level we have the fraud proven 

422
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,650
that Democrat connected grips.
We're already loading code on a machines

423
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,780
all over the country,
but it's different complex.

424
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:07,614
But about thing was 18 percent of the 
machines in the country to be able to 

425
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:10,883
remotely break in and,
and flip votes show because they were 

426
00:19:14,491 --> 00:19:15,324
aware of that.
A bunch of states were waiting and 

427
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:17,334
watching and homeland security broken 
live into six dates and kept trying to 

428
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:22,164
flip the results,
and they even have screenshots and 

429
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:26,850
videos of them in the computers in there
clicking and doing it all.

430
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,710
There's major investigations going on.
You heard the news,

431
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,613
trump's crazy.
He claims illegals voted to make it 

432
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:32,604
about illegals.
That was one statement and a larger 

433
00:19:33,751 --> 00:19:36,750
election fraud deal of actual computers 
show.

434
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:37,584
So trump knows about all this,
so she comes on and says they're 

435
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,590
planning this fraud.
Then she comes on after the election and

436
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,181
she says,
yes,

437
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,490
it's clear.
Here's where precincts close.

438
00:19:44,491 --> 00:19:45,324
Here's where all this happened,
where 100 percent went for Hillary or 

439
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,010
right after it closed,
all the votes then came in.

440
00:19:50,011 --> 00:19:52,260
We're 100 percent for Hillary.
They didn't even care,

441
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,140
but the landslide was so big for trump.
They couldn't steal it.

442
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:55,974
She successfully stole five states.
She tried to break into six others or 

443
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:00,234
her controllers did and got blocked.
The tsunami for trump was so huge with 

444
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:06,384
the real politic.
We can break down later that they still 

445
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:08,754
weren't able to steal it,
and now patriots inside US intelligence 

446
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:15,060
agencies are preparing to roll up the 
pedophile networks nationwide.

447
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,970
So you've seen arrest in Pennsylvania,
arrested in La.

448
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,290
I haven't seen these arrests.
Who's getting there?

449
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,400
It's just now breaking and it.
It's.

450
00:20:21,401 --> 00:20:24,010
It's big institutionalized.
One hundred 74 arrests,

451
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:24,863
28 sexually exploited children rescued 
during statewide human traffic 

452
00:20:27,901 --> 00:20:29,600
operation.
They're getting mentally,

453
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,290
she has a takeover,
right?

454
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,120
Holy Shit.
But look at the numbers.

455
00:20:33,121 --> 00:20:33,954
They're 474 people arrested,
but there are only rolling up the rin 

456
00:20:37,591 --> 00:20:42,050
fields that get the people for the 
psychic vampires know insane.

457
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,190
Is it that this is still happening?
Right?

458
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,200
So all the people that thought that,
this idea that,

459
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,070
you know what

460
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,600
I mean,
whether they tried to make it ridiculous

461
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:52,270
by calling a pizza gate are connected 
into a pizza place.

462
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,100
Everybody that thought that was 
ridiculous.

463
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,263
It is ridiculous that there could 
potentially be some sort of a pedophile 

464
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:02,800
ring and see how they tricked Turkish.
They go pick some pizza place.

465
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:05,950
Probably have their people go on,
make comments on some message board.

466
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,780
CNN,
New York Times,

467
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:08,614
Washington Post the same day,
come out and say all the emails are 

468
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:16,030
discredited from New York and California
and Hawaii because there's this innocent

469
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:16,864
pizza place over here that some of the 
Democrats go to and they're all saying 

470
00:21:20,171 --> 00:21:22,060
that's where the pedophiles are at.
Okay,

471
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:27,020
so then the Internet all goes in,
looks at that and starts trying to prove

472
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,600
to disprove msm that,
oh,

473
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:32,380
there must be something going on there.
So then that turns that all into the big

474
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:33,214
quagmire as a smokescreen from all the 
admitted stuff that's happening because 

475
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:36,963
I was told by my Nyp d high level 
sources that they've got all this stuff 

476
00:21:40,571 --> 00:21:41,404
on wieners computer that just got 
scooped up during the whole hacking 

477
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,653
story and the whole story about Hillary 
and the unsecured servers and that that 

478
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,840
was being blocked by Obama and that as 
soon as trump got in,

479
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,460
they would go back after winter.

480
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,473
Then I was told about former section 
chief from the CIA that indeed this was 

481
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:01,090
an operation that we're running against 
him to start leaking all this.

482
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,283
And so what you're beginning to see is 
the beginning of all the pedophilia 

483
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:05,524
coming out as they roll up the procurers
that grabbed your kids out of backyards 

484
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,050
or that go out as social workers and get
the kids or whatever.

485
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,770
They're rolling all those up right now 
to get the renfield.

486
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:16,330
Renfield brings the people to Dracula 
because that's the allegory.

487
00:22:16,331 --> 00:22:17,660
I'm not saying it right,
but I know what you're saying.

488
00:22:17,661 --> 00:22:18,494
So they're gonna now.
Roll it up into the higher level groups 

489
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,663
right now.
Here's what's going on with a lot of 

490
00:22:23,231 --> 00:22:24,064
this stuff.
You have to be real careful in how you 

491
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:26,644
describe these things and how you talk 
about these things because people are 

492
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:29,764
looking for any little tiny thing to 
discredit it and one of the reasons why 

493
00:22:32,861 --> 00:22:33,694
they're looking at it,
they're doing it for personal reasons 

494
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:39,130
because it seems you no one wants to be 
ridiculous.

495
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,023
No one wants to be a fool and no one 
wants to be someone who's talking about 

496
00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:43,414
conspiracies that aren't real.
So people are very hesitant to talk 

497
00:22:46,871 --> 00:22:49,690
about something that's unproven but 
horrific.

498
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:50,973
Just like 15 years ago,
it was a conspiracy theory that the 

499
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,920
Catholic Church had any pedophelic.
Now we know 30,

500
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,943
30 percent we're doing it.
We now know the old pope had to step 

501
00:23:01,271 --> 00:23:02,104
down,
was blackmailed within fall about other 

502
00:23:03,851 --> 00:23:05,890
high level preached by the new guy that 
came in.

503
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,780
Uh,
I mean this is heavy.

504
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:08,590
It's the,
the,

505
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,423
the,
the Catholic church stuff is absolutely 

506
00:23:10,841 --> 00:23:13,270
horrible and proven over and over again.
And again,

507
00:23:13,271 --> 00:23:14,680
when I was a kid,
it was rumor,

508
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,380
it was just things that were whispered.
You would hear about it.

509
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,273
And now it's.
I always wondered how they're getting 

510
00:23:19,811 --> 00:23:21,250
away with it.
It's so out in the open.

511
00:23:21,251 --> 00:23:22,084
How come there isn't more of a psychic 
vampire stealing the energy from the 

512
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:25,541
kids?
Well,

513
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:29,380
what the most common thing they do find 
very often in jail,

514
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,263
the most common thing they do is they 
find very troubled kids that don't talk 

515
00:23:33,401 --> 00:23:35,380
about it.
People with foster care,

516
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,483
kids with no parents.
Kids who come from really troubled 

517
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,530
backgrounds who were abused like 
Sandusky,

518
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:46,020
ran a abused children's shelter and 
Grove

519
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,680
and then would take the kids out 
sometimes overnight.

520
00:23:48,681 --> 00:23:50,660
It rich people's houses to make them 
feel better.

521
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,860
Yeah.
Yeah.

522
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:52,783
It's.
And then no one wants to believe that 

523
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:57,350
the is that the assistant coach and that
all these powerful people.

524
00:23:57,351 --> 00:23:58,184
But when he finally got caught,
he was raping eight year olds in the 

525
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,350
showers at noon on a Saturday at the 
field house.

526
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,950
Yeah.
And someone who worked there,

527
00:24:06,951 --> 00:24:08,830
found it,
watched it happen,

528
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,870
walked in on them literally.
And that's what it all fell apart.

529
00:24:12,871 --> 00:24:15,230
And that's what always happens.
Those guys get more and more arrogant.

530
00:24:15,231 --> 00:24:16,064
And so all I'm telling you is I'm not 
saying anybody's guilty and these 

531
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:18,374
thousands of emails,
you go read them and it's like the last 

532
00:24:20,631 --> 00:24:22,940
walnut sauce you brought wasn't very 
good.

533
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,860
Oh,
well these are good walnuts.

534
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:25,731
You're going to.
Oh,

535
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:26,564
I love walnuts.
And then you go read in the FBI 

536
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,810
breakdown what?
That's code for.

537
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,720
What's called for Walnut means people 
with Brown skin.

538
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,280
Oh Jesus Christ.

539
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,123
Well,
Gunderson was talking about this for 

540
00:24:38,571 --> 00:24:40,340
years.
FBI chief formula.

541
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,490
He discovered a bunch of it,
uh,

542
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,590
in Los Angeles.
He was,

543
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,620
he was the head of the La Sector.
So people are gonna hear this.

544
00:24:45,621 --> 00:24:46,051
And they go,
oh,

545
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:48,860
they're a bunch of pizza gate troopers.
These guys are a bunch of pizza.

546
00:24:48,861 --> 00:24:49,650
Great Truth.
There's,

547
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:50,483
there's,
there's an inclination to automatically 

548
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,290
dismiss things.
Let me be clear,

549
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,100
let me be clear.
I am on the covering 50 topics a day.

550
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,263
These emails are coming out.
I get contact with one of my sources by 

551
00:25:03,321 --> 00:25:06,170
people in the NYP ed.
I get sent documents,

552
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,880
photos of their licensed law 
enforcement.

553
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,130
I talked to these people.
Then they say,

554
00:25:10,131 --> 00:25:10,550
yeah,
no,

555
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,110
it's horrible.
It's a bunch of pedophilia.

556
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,550
Um,
you know,

557
00:25:13,551 --> 00:25:14,150
it,
it,

558
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,250
it's a bunch of child porn.
It's all gonna come out.

559
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,800
It's tied to all these different groups.
And I'm just like,

560
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:19,490
okay.

561
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,230
So I go on air and I say,
listen,

562
00:25:21,231 --> 00:25:23,780
I got this from real NYP and at other 
sources.

563
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,003
And then Erik Prince of Blackwater still
rests with the biggest groups in the 

564
00:25:28,971 --> 00:25:29,804
world.
Does he run some sort of military 

565
00:25:31,131 --> 00:25:33,640
operation?
And I'm like Bahrain,

566
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,510
our Saudi Arabia.
Absolutely.

567
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:37,740
The point is,
is that he comes back says,

568
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,640
is that the UAE can ask you about it.
He knows all about it.

569
00:25:40,641 --> 00:25:41,474
But the point is,
is that all this happens and he comes 

570
00:25:44,031 --> 00:25:45,860
out in the news.
Okay,

571
00:25:45,861 --> 00:25:47,750
through the lighthouse,
Oregon,

572
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:50,690
breitbart basically from trump's mouth 
and says,

573
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:51,763
yes,
we've confirmed high level pedophilia 

574
00:25:52,911 --> 00:25:55,490
rings in the Clinton operation.
We're going to bring them down.

575
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,623
And so that's what all this is.
Why did Breitbart tweet about that in 

576
00:25:59,781 --> 00:26:01,580
2011?
Do you remember that tweet,

577
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,450
right?
Barton knew about it.

578
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,710
Came out right?
Bart said,

579
00:26:03,711 --> 00:26:04,544
I'm going to bring out the biggest thing
that's going to bring down the 

580
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:06,260
Democrats.

581
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,030
And they poisoned him right here in 
California.

582
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,290
Initially poisoned,
you know?

583
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:10,130
Absolutely.
They killed him.

584
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,710
Where did what happened?
I didn't even know how he died.

585
00:26:12,711 --> 00:26:13,960
He,
I thought he died of a heart attack.

586
00:26:13,961 --> 00:26:15,740
Is that what?
Are you laughing?

587
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:19,210
Fake laughing and pull up the.
I'm laughing.

588
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,030
Just.
No,

589
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:23,060
I know you're in the media.
I'm a pull up bar out Joe.

590
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:23,960
I won't buddy.
You know.

591
00:26:23,961 --> 00:26:24,820
I love you.
Anyway,

592
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,760
pull up the breitbart email or the 
Breitbart tweet because it's a crazy.

593
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,210
Joe knows all about this.
Well,

594
00:26:29,211 --> 00:26:31,040
the tweet is pretty insane.
When you read it,

595
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:31,641
you're like,
wait,

596
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:33,810
what the fuck is going on?
Like every.

597
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,420
There's an instantaneous reaction that 
people have their intelligence,

598
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,690
right?
You're right.

599
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,740
You're already telling me people are 
doing this to kids.

600
00:26:42,741 --> 00:26:44,020
You don't get the fuck out

601
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,940
of here.
That's nonsense,

602
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,550
but when you tell people about the stuff
that's been proven,

603
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,180
the ones that have their own account,
they don't call.

604
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:53,520
They don't attach those.
I was on Air Shang.

605
00:26:53,521 --> 00:26:54,354
I'm told this by NYP ed in like three 
different shows and that there's going 

606
00:26:57,361 --> 00:26:58,194
to come out that leaner sending child 
porn and it's in the news today what 

607
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:01,674
they're saying,
what they're accusing Wiener of 

608
00:27:02,541 --> 00:27:07,140
apparently sending sexually explicit 
text to an underage girl.

609
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,440
That's what's against the law.
So the calling the child porn,

610
00:27:10,441 --> 00:27:14,850
but it's essentially he was sending 
pornographic text to a 15 year old.

611
00:27:14,851 --> 00:27:15,684
Yeah,
well I was told it's a lot more than 

612
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:17,124
that.
What they're doing is minimizing it 

613
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:21,750
because the higher ups are being told 
you don't let this out.

614
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,543
Let me tell you.
Wiener supposedly had tens of thousands 

615
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:26,394
of emails.
Wiener should be a fucking comedian for 

616
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:28,590
sure.

617
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,330
He's a freak.
He's got real problems.

618
00:27:30,331 --> 00:27:32,550
He's a good communicator.
A Betty's hilarious.

619
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,700
Come on,
don't you think?

620
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,170
All I know is I'm not saying even 
wieners a pedophile.

621
00:27:37,171 --> 00:27:39,540
All I know is all I know is.
Listen,

622
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,300
we all know about Jerry Epstein.
Okay.

623
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:45,210
And that don't know about Jerry the 
Lolita Express.

624
00:27:45,211 --> 00:27:47,340
Just Google that.
And what does that.

625
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,180
Bill Clinton was on 20 flights first it 
was.

626
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,133
Oh,
that's right.

627
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:53,130
Okay.
Has a temple in it.

628
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,263
And then he was also flying to this 
Middle Eastern country with this chic 

629
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,503
that's admitted pedophile with 
multimillion dollar checks at Bill 

630
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:00,863
Clinton on the plane.
And Bill Clinton's a known sexual 

631
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:03,150
predator.
Okay.

632
00:28:03,151 --> 00:28:03,984
So all this stuff's going on.
And shall they start bringing up 

633
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:08,184
lawsuits against Donald Trump with Jane 
Doe's claiming he'd been with Epstein 

634
00:28:12,001 --> 00:28:12,834
even though there's no proof and the law
because they make you log in on private 

635
00:28:14,311 --> 00:28:14,550
jets.

636
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:18,030
None of it was ever true.
He'd been at here is how Prague,

637
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,133
Prague Progressive Guru John Podesta is 
in household name is worldclass under 

638
00:28:23,441 --> 00:28:24,031
age,
sex,

639
00:28:24,031 --> 00:28:29,031
slave up cover up or defending.
Unspeakable dregs escapes me early on.

640
00:28:29,671 --> 00:28:33,220
Did John Podesta.
Imagine his baby m,

641
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:33,940
m,
F A.

642
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,773
I don't know what that is.
Would be covering up for underage sex 

643
00:28:37,171 --> 00:28:40,710
ops in H ow.
Hate crimes against blacks.

644
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,710
Don't know what that means.
Um,

645
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,880
what does m,
m,

646
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:49,740
f a young Jamie media matters.
Huh?

647
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,140
Isn't that still rose?
Yeah,

648
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:54,690
that's us.
But also guess who owns the pizza place?

649
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,540
Who were all this one on its,
it's media matters.

650
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,463
Head guy.
David Brock's boyfriend and that is 

651
00:29:01,051 --> 00:29:02,940
where they have major democratic party 
fundraisers.

652
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:07,170
And then they had,
they had rock bands there that,

653
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,200
that gave live spoken word dissertations
of the love of children.

654
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,213
What I'm talking about guys liking golf?
Drag con about how much they love 

655
00:29:18,721 --> 00:29:20,160
children.
Have you seen this?

656
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,053
Yeah.
I don't even really want to repeat what 

657
00:29:21,691 --> 00:29:22,524
they really pull it up.
One is a video of them saying that it 

658
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:26,700
was the comments,
which is a comet ping pong.

659
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:31,170
So do you know what?
Why is really.

660
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,480
It's a very,
very bizarre subject.

661
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:36,000
But why is this like.
So what is this right here?

662
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:36,834
You bring it up,
Jamie.

663
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,610
Okay.
Give me some volume.

664
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,400
Great thing.

665
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:47,400
Can you are below a sandwich?
Sharp shooter read is

666
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,410
two.
Came down here.

667
00:29:53,411 --> 00:29:58,411
He likes the world sounds.
We listening to his manager.

668
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,940
That's super weird.
That first of all,

669
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:21,160
does Comet Ping Pong?
Anybody listening?

670
00:30:21,161 --> 00:30:22,750
Let's describe what that person looked 
like.

671
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,900
They were wearing a wig,
a blonde wig,

672
00:30:25,901 --> 00:30:30,901
and it was a guy transvestite or a woman
who's just smoked every cigarette.

673
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,820
It's one of the two.
But uh,

674
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:39,010
this is the fact that that was going on 
at that place.

675
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:42,010
Seems really odd.
But that sounds like someone ad libbing,

676
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,600
you know,
we all have preferences.

677
00:30:44,601 --> 00:30:47,510
I was trying to be funny,
like it's almost like in the,

678
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:50,250
in the,
in the little boy.

679
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,970
Oh yeah.
A lot of creepy artwork and I'll talk to

680
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,960
that guy.
Lot of creepy artwork.

681
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,310
I mean,
that's a fact.

682
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:58,683
There's a lot of facts.
So it's one of those things are not 

683
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,720
saying that I'm not either.
That's what's really important.

684
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:05,883
I never even really covered this stuff.
And then they had me on the news and 

685
00:31:08,231 --> 00:31:11,650
also swan going,
they said these people were killing kids

686
00:31:11,651 --> 00:31:12,220
in a basement.

687
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,410
They say,
okay,

688
00:31:13,411 --> 00:31:14,244
I'm Megan Kelly went on and took a clip 
where I was talking about Hillary show 

689
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,113
funding jihadis and and Obama back in 
the Arab spring that killed tens of 

690
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,470
thousands of people,
hundreds of thousands of people,

691
00:31:23,471 --> 00:31:26,110
thousands of children now.
Al Qaeda was putting kids,

692
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,420
which is Isis,
into sex slavery.

693
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:33,250
They edited that out and then cut it 
together on Fox News with me.

694
00:31:33,251 --> 00:31:34,084
Shane and Hillary Clinton ranks and 
kills children in a basement at ping 

695
00:31:36,911 --> 00:31:39,700
pong pizza.
They literally now edit audio,

696
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,530
but I was able to get changed your 
audio.

697
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,423
I was able to go find the day with video
with what I really said and throw it 

698
00:31:45,581 --> 00:31:47,740
back in their face.
Wow.

699
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:49,320
That's really blatant.
That's what.

700
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,650
Where's this?
Can we watch this?

701
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,060
Where?
Where is this that they did that?

702
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,460
You guys have to come the comparison of 
the two up?

703
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,353
Yeah.
It's something like Megan Kelly caught 

704
00:31:57,051 --> 00:31:58,510
at giant lie against Alex show.

705
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:02,180
I'm trying to find that we should.
We should play that fast.

706
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,760
First of all,
Megan Kelly,

707
00:32:03,761 --> 00:32:04,594
so pretty.
She could say whatever the fuck she 

708
00:32:05,171 --> 00:32:07,000
wants.
I think she looks like an old training.

709
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,190
I love her.
Do things loosely.

710
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:10,870
An old training.
You're hilarious.

711
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,210
No,
I don't like old trainings,

712
00:32:13,211 --> 00:32:14,560
but I think she's hot.
You know,

713
00:32:14,561 --> 00:32:17,590
like you don't think Meghan Kelly's.
Now I just want to insult this globalist

714
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,660
global.
Obviously she's pretty.

715
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:21,220
Do you know Joe?
She's real ugly.

716
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,470
She.
Do you think that she was.

717
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,313
She's moved over to NBC.
Do you think she's going to change your 

718
00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:25,624
tune now and go for the little niece?
She wants to be the quote New Fox News 

719
00:32:28,421 --> 00:32:30,220
show.
They'll be the near kind of Glenn Beck.

720
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,233
I'm a conservative,
but I hate conservatives and 

721
00:32:32,261 --> 00:32:36,190
Libertarians and I speak for everyone 
and I can decode it all so she shouldn't

722
00:32:36,191 --> 00:32:39,260
go over there and be the conservative 
light and try to get them some ratings.

723
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,100
So it seems

724
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,080
like NBC realized is that's where the 
money.

725
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:42,953
Is that what you're saying?
Want to see how fake news is made from 

726
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:46,940
Meghan Kelly on Fox News?
Did you find it Jeremy?

727
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,350
Okay,
let's play it here.

728
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,600
Here we go.
Give us some volume.

729
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,280
This whole thing.
Got Pizza Gate conspiracy gun man.

730
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,180
Many controversies.
Do these days,

731
00:32:57,181 --> 00:32:58,014
it began with a tweet on October 30th 
days after the FBI announced they'd be 

732
00:33:02,131 --> 00:33:05,730
reopening and investigation into Hillary
Clinton's emails.

733
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,773
Someone on twitter who's name remains 
unverified but has several thousand 

734
00:33:10,441 --> 00:33:11,274
followers,
posted that new emails found on Anthony 

735
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,233
Wiener's.
Computer confirmed that Hillary Clinton 

736
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:17,933
was involved in a pedophilia ring.
The twitter post included information 

737
00:33:22,171 --> 00:33:24,330
from a facebook user who stated,
quote,

738
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:28,650
my Nyp dea source said it's much more 
viable and serious.

739
00:33:28,651 --> 00:33:31,380
Then classified material on wieners 
device.

740
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,040
We're talking in international child 
enslavement and sex room.

741
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,373
The next day.

742
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,140
Places shouldn't be,
but backing up to the second now,

743
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,283
this is probably trying to debunk us.
What they do is they misrepresent what 

744
00:33:42,081 --> 00:33:43,280
we're saying,
so again,

745
00:33:43,281 --> 00:33:46,640
whoever these rogue people were or or I 
don't know who they are saying,

746
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:47,503
oh,
look in ypd says it's wiener and all 

747
00:33:48,771 --> 00:33:49,830
this.
She highly,

748
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,590
we're saying,
none of that's happening now.

749
00:33:51,591 --> 00:33:53,690
It's actually starting to come out.
I don't know how far,

750
00:33:53,691 --> 00:33:56,090
how deep it goes,
but this is when Kelly,

751
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,280
let's let it play out and respond to it 
afterwards.

752
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,153
Otherwise,
we're gonna.

753
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,303
Go ahead.

754
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,300
This is the right one book user who 
stated,

755
00:34:03,301 --> 00:34:04,134
quote,
my Nyp dea source said it's much more 

756
00:34:06,541 --> 00:34:10,680
viable and serious then classified 
material on wieners device.

757
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:15,630
We're talking in international child 
enslavement and sex ring the next day.

758
00:34:15,631 --> 00:34:20,490
The bogus claim was picked up by a 
website called your newswire.com

759
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,533
message boards like four Chan and reddit
right wing blogs and several pro trump 

760
00:34:26,221 --> 00:34:28,230
websites.
Info wars,

761
00:34:28,231 --> 00:34:29,064
Alex Jones,
Afar right web host posted a youtube 

762
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:35,040
video seen almost 500,000
times

763
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:41,980
personally.
I have zero fear Kenny up against you.

764
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:47,643
The rumor spread,
inspiring some new found Internet 

765
00:34:50,231 --> 00:34:54,030
sleuths to start digging around in John 
Podesta's hacked emails,

766
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,850
searching for proof and location of the 
so called sex ring.

767
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,940
What they found were numerous references
to pizza.

768
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,540
Now,
here's what our Jones

769
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:08,740
set resistance to tyrants is obedience 
message to Hillary.

770
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,003
What I think about children,
Hillary Clinton has personally murdered 

771
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,323
the chopped up,
right to have zero fear of standing up 

772
00:35:23,931 --> 00:35:24,764
against know you heard me right it.
Hillary Clinton has personally murdered 

773
00:35:28,191 --> 00:35:31,230
children.
Go tell that loan liar.

774
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,340
Can't hold back anymore until the 
rivalry.

775
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:38,130
Clinton is one of the most vicious 
serial killers

776
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,030
the planet's ever seen.

777
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:43,623
There's a twist to that,
talking about the devil worship story 

778
00:35:46,341 --> 00:35:49,070
with her chief of staff or campaign 
chairman,

779
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,253
the League as a menu of blood and Shimon
and body parts with Atlanta Alisha 

780
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,460
Crowley event,
a private event.

781
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,170
Oh No,
I'm not talking about that.

782
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,303
I mean 200,000
plus dead Christians with her operation 

783
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:01,784
with Syria and our operation in Libya 
and not letting the Christians get out 

784
00:36:05,061 --> 00:36:05,894
and directing al Qaeda and isis who 
target and murdered children and put 

785
00:36:09,321 --> 00:36:10,154
them through sex slavery and throw 
Catholic priest off cliffs and kill 

786
00:36:12,891 --> 00:36:13,724
people and Mash and murder gauge and 
everything else you can imagine because 

787
00:36:17,121 --> 00:36:22,121
they don't like peaceful people and they
caught him by the there for open society

788
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:25,910
and they love everybody.
Anything they do is for degradation

789
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,023
and someone could have been killed 
inside of your restaurant for no good 

790
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:34,020
reason.
People like Alex Jones Fan,

791
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:38,700
a conspiracy theory that even the DC 
police say has no basis.

792
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:39,900
In fact,
yes,

793
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,710
it's a pack of lies and it's dangerous.

794
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,160
What happened to the boyfriend

795
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,123
to drive across four state lines with an
assault rifle and enter a family 

796
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:54,540
friendly restaurant at 3:00
in the afternoon on a Sunday.

797
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,620
I know reddit has banned this topic on 
its website.

798
00:36:58,621 --> 00:37:03,120
I mean slowly but surely those who 
helped fan it are trying to dial it back

799
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:07,050
out of the safety concerns for the 
safety of those who have been endangered

800
00:37:07,051 --> 00:37:09,960
by pis could happen to anyone.
It's not just us.

801
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:12,660
It's any single person.
I know you said there are producers.

802
00:37:12,661 --> 00:37:15,720
It's also surreal until the gun comes 
in.

803
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,050
Wow.

804
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,970
And then some guy for being here.
So they went.

805
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,890
They got it.
They didn't get it off youtube.

806
00:37:20,891 --> 00:37:24,610
They got the full clap.
They cut the front off knowing.

807
00:37:24,611 --> 00:37:25,444
I was actually saying,
I don't know about the satanism before 

808
00:37:27,731 --> 00:37:32,200
the term pizza gate was out there,
but I do know she's funded the radicals.

809
00:37:32,201 --> 00:37:33,760
I came,
I saw they die.

810
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:37,780
He do rape and kill and cut up kids.
So she personally is.

811
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,053
You are making a very provocative 
statement and you made it very 

812
00:37:41,981 --> 00:37:45,920
provocative statement by saying 
something kind of crazy at first.

813
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,103
And then backing it up and so what they 
decided to do is just edit a chunk of 

814
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:52,600
that and so they didn't really have to 
edit it and chop it up.

815
00:37:52,601 --> 00:37:53,434
But they did take it,
take it out of context and said that I 

816
00:37:56,801 --> 00:37:57,850
was talking about.
Right.

817
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:58,923
But you weren't.
And I was talking about the spirit 

818
00:38:00,971 --> 00:38:03,190
cooking Alistair Crowley stuff with the 
lady is written,

819
00:38:03,191 --> 00:38:04,024
it's real for her.
And they go and I take little kids have 

820
00:38:06,011 --> 00:38:08,530
these parties and they have of blood.
That's one thing,

821
00:38:08,531 --> 00:38:10,030
if you were an adult one to do that,
you know,

822
00:38:10,031 --> 00:38:12,430
issue some art project.
This is real.

823
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,070
And so I was talking about the menu,
were there in the email saying,

824
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,450
you know,
we're going to have plenty of blood,

825
00:38:16,451 --> 00:38:18,910
plenty of semen for you.
And other delicious things on the menu.

826
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,070
And he's like,
what are the juices on the menu?

827
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:23,260
And they go,
well we're going to have cheese pizza.

828
00:38:23,261 --> 00:38:25,020
We're gonna have,
we're gonna have the,

829
00:38:25,021 --> 00:38:26,110
the,
the nut sauce.

830
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,420
We're going to have the pasta and we're 
going to have,

831
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,040
you know,
Shaquille and hot dogs.

832
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,860
We know you love sucking one hot dogs 
and they go,

833
00:38:32,861 --> 00:38:34,560
Oh God,
I want to go back to that place in a why

834
00:38:34,561 --> 00:38:35,980
that had the best dogs,
you

835
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:36,960
know,
so yes,

836
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:39,580
we've got hot dogs and Obama wants 
$65,000

837
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,920
or the hot dogs live with the party.
Will the hot dogs be there?

838
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,660
And then it's in Stratford and CII 
emails that got leaked by wikileaks did.

839
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,490
Now people cross reference where the 
CIA's like watching going,

840
00:38:48,491 --> 00:38:51,490
oh look at Obama and Chicago,
another hot dog party.

841
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:57,210
Well did they momma is at a party with 
15 dudes and that's his issue.

842
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,920
The point is though,
they can blackmail him with this and the

843
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,800
stuff.
We never got pedophile codes with Obama.

844
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:03,211
Yeah,
no,

845
00:39:03,211 --> 00:39:04,044
it's,
it's men.

846
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:09,370
I mean he's had his mother trying to say
that Barack Obama is a homosexual.

847
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,290
Sandy's bisexual.
How dare you.

848
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,870
I really don't even care if you ever 
seen him with a man.

849
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:16,530
How do you know this is true of seeding 
with men walking down the street?

850
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,060
Maybe he just likes to bring dudes and 
have conversations with them.

851
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:19,923
Maybe he just works hard to tell it to 
people and you're the head of the free 

852
00:39:21,671 --> 00:39:24,730
world.
Maybe he had a party with $65,000

853
00:39:24,731 --> 00:39:25,600
with the hot dogs.
Yeah,

854
00:39:25,601 --> 00:39:26,930
maybe loves hot dogs.
He said,

855
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,300
fuck it.
Fuck this diet.

856
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,180
I'm not the president anymore filling.
Now listen,

857
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,750
I tried 65,000,
$65,000.

858
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,490
He's balling.
That's more of the 65,000

859
00:39:36,491 --> 00:39:37,720
hot dogs.
What a gourmet hot does.

860
00:39:37,721 --> 00:39:41,230
What a dollar apiece to color.
How many say it's super gourmet?

861
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,380
$5 a piece for each president needs a 
hot dog helping hands.

862
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:49,120
What if it turns out he was like the 10 
time hot dog eating champion.

863
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:50,560
He's like one of those.
That's probably it.

864
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,660
What does that say?
He probably.

865
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:52,523
Okay.
Let's say he just really likes hot dogs 

866
00:39:55,091 --> 00:39:56,590
here.
Alex Jones,

867
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:59,770
like there's a whole article on sale for
$65,000

868
00:39:59,771 --> 00:40:01,720
for the hot dogs.
$5 a piece.

869
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,910
$5 per hotdog.
But listen,

870
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,530
you know,
you got to get those delivered.

871
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:06,700
Someone's gonna make.
I'm gonna.

872
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,350
Grind it up,
put it in the casing,

873
00:40:08,351 --> 00:40:10,430
the whole deal.
Maybe he gets like gourmet hot dogs.

874
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,480
Got to put those kids putting together 
some giant party.

875
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:17,080
Some I'm out of this job party.
I don't know,

876
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,260
but what a dog is a code for male 
prostitutes.

877
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,430
Okay.
Maybe it is,

878
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:24,010
but what I'm saying is anybody who's 
skeptical,

879
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:28,420
anybody who's looking at this and go,
and you guys are so fucking crazy.

880
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,433
This is so you're.
You're making such gigantic leaps of 

881
00:40:31,781 --> 00:40:33,400
faith.
No leaps.

882
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,300
Just looking on how with the weird code 
in those emails,

883
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:42,100
there was definitely some code and show 
after this one,

884
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:44,200
I'm in fact my crew actually got mad to 
be honest with you,

885
00:40:44,201 --> 00:40:47,500
but you tell her about the truth.
There were about five days into this and

886
00:40:47,501 --> 00:40:48,334
the news hadn't even picked it up and 
all my crew was doing all day reading 

887
00:40:50,771 --> 00:40:51,490
thousands of emails.

888
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,323
I mean there's thousands that are just 
related to food and hot dogs and kids 

889
00:40:55,631 --> 00:40:58,540
and hot tubs and kid deliveries and all 
and,

890
00:40:58,541 --> 00:40:58,980
and,
and.

891
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:59,813
Oh,
the spirit cooking and Alistair Crowley 

892
00:41:01,061 --> 00:41:02,710
and oh,
there'll be semen and blood.

893
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:03,970
I told my crew,
I said,

894
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,170
it's probably true.
No one's going to believe it.

895
00:41:06,171 --> 00:41:07,004
Stop obsessing on it and stop reading 
these emails because I want to focus on 

896
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:12,700
the election and everything else that's 
happening,

897
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:17,560
so then site start accusing me of 
covering up the the pedesta stuff before

898
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:18,394
it's called pizza gate and then I get 
blamed for being behind pizza gate and 

899
00:41:21,671 --> 00:41:22,504
I'm not even bitching.
I'm explaining what it's like to really 

900
00:41:24,071 --> 00:41:27,070
be trying to get at the truth and the 
people take the fact that it's complex.

901
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,250
She'd be better at this to me.
Jokes,

902
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,103
you know how to put stuff out.
Clear and Parson I just know all this 

903
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:32,510
crap,
but you get crazy and still ran.

904
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,980
People won't listen to me because I got 
too

905
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,840
much data.
And you imagine what this is like.

906
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,760
I mean it's just.
I'm sick of it.

907
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,470
I don't know everything that's going on,
but I know this.

908
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:42,950
I have good CIA people and FBI and 
secret service.

909
00:41:42,951 --> 00:41:43,970
Okay.
Telling me.

910
00:41:43,971 --> 00:41:44,511
Yes.
Alex.

911
00:41:44,511 --> 00:41:45,350
it's worse than,
you know.

912
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,480
Keep getting them.
It's going to come out and it's starting

913
00:41:47,481 --> 00:41:48,830
to come out and saying,
watch.

914
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,900
When we started arresting the pedophile 
networks,

915
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:53,960
we're going to roll up the Democrats and
the Republicans that are involved,

916
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,000
and that's why trump said in his 
speeches at the,

917
00:41:56,001 --> 00:41:58,010
at the inaugural,
this is not about parties.

918
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:00,770
We're taking these people on.
We're bringing God back in.

919
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,753
Even somebody that wasn't very religious
like trump has gotten religion learning 

920
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:06,110
about this because let me tell you 
something.

921
00:42:06,111 --> 00:42:06,944
Trump's not a devil worshiper and he 
loves God and he's been briefed on all 

922
00:42:09,681 --> 00:42:12,830
this and he's going to roll their ass up
so the pedophiles better get ready.

923
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:13,783
I want to.
I want you to clear something up right 

924
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:15,164
now.
Look at that camera and tell everybody 

925
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:19,660
you're not bill Hicks.
So stupid to tell them you're not.

926
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,380
I'm not either tell them.
Well,

927
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,990
number one,
people think there's a god conspiracy.

928
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,960
Here's what happens.
They think it's a flat earth too.

929
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,410
I take real stuff.
Notice Joseph has researched,

930
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,253
not kissing his ass,
so he knows all these little points on 

931
00:42:31,701 --> 00:42:33,070
making better than I even did.
Yeah.

932
00:42:33,071 --> 00:42:34,460
I'm like remembering stuff when he 
brings it up,

933
00:42:34,461 --> 00:42:37,250
because I try to suppress after is crap.
I can't handle it anymore,

934
00:42:37,251 --> 00:42:38,084
man.
I'm 43 and I'm sitting here looking at 

935
00:42:40,011 --> 00:42:40,844
all this and that,
and these people come to you on the 

936
00:42:41,751 --> 00:42:43,040
street and they go,
hey joe,

937
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,023
hey,
Joe sent me five times and then I tried 

938
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:46,251
like,
oh,

939
00:42:46,251 --> 00:42:47,190
I knew you were.
You know,

940
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:50,030
we're,
we're not just telling us Alex,

941
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:50,811
whatever,
whatever.

942
00:42:50,811 --> 00:42:53,070
My fucking name is the programming.

943
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,690
Say Bill Hicks.
Yeah,

944
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,740
I got no stress.
All they say,

945
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,293
here's the.
I'll be on the street or I'll be at a 

946
00:43:00,171 --> 00:43:01,310
restaurant and they come over and they 
go.

947
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:03,110
They say,
hey bill,

948
00:43:03,111 --> 00:43:03,944
hey bill.
Hey Bill.

949
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:07,090
They don't really show Rogan variously 
and,

950
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,630
and I'm,
and I turned around and go,

951
00:43:08,631 --> 00:43:10,250
oh,
I know what you all.

952
00:43:10,251 --> 00:43:11,084
Because I did a few pieces and one 
little video with a guy that lived in 

953
00:43:14,811 --> 00:43:16,600
Austin and the unit,
it's how I met with,

954
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,850
but you don't like Bill Hicks.
That's what's ridiculous about it.

955
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:22,640
Like what'd you get?
Like massive plastic surgery changed the

956
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:23,474
way your voice sounds like your voice is
so different than thing is that no one 

957
00:43:27,051 --> 00:43:27,884
ever wants to look real conspiracies 
because they're complex and hard to 

958
00:43:29,871 --> 00:43:30,704
understand.
They want to just go with the earth is 

959
00:43:32,451 --> 00:43:33,650
flat.
Uh,

960
00:43:33,651 --> 00:43:34,484
you know,
there's aliens living underneath the 

961
00:43:35,061 --> 00:43:35,570
capital.

962
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,520
Dinosaurs aren't real or.
Well,

963
00:43:37,521 --> 00:43:38,060
no,
I mean,

964
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:38,893
listen,
the point is I'm not going to Bash 

965
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:40,971
Eddie,
Eddie,

966
00:43:40,971 --> 00:43:41,460
Eddie,
Eddie.

967
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,570
It's good to have a free open mind,
but he doesn't promulgate stuff.

968
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:45,523
He's only researching what's been said.
So I want to just get this out of the 

969
00:43:47,601 --> 00:43:48,830
way.
I am Bill Hicks.

970
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:50,090
I'm actually,
you are.

971
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,530
Hell,
we'll bill hicks be like 60.

972
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:56,510
Um,
I think he died at 32 and 1994.

973
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:58,550
So,
uh,

974
00:43:58,910 --> 00:43:59,990
do the math.
I know one thing.

975
00:43:59,991 --> 00:44:03,680
It's hot in here isn't really.
I don't know.

976
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,900
I always keep my studio really cold.
Oh,

977
00:44:05,901 --> 00:44:06,370
do you?
Well,

978
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:08,350
you get crazy.
You're a goddamn fun.

979
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,650
Inferno.
A melting.

980
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:10,543
You know,
there's a lot of people that don't know 

981
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:13,833
like how you got started,
but one of the things I thought was 

982
00:44:15,531 --> 00:44:19,000
really bizarre in that thing was that 
lady was calling you a right wing host,

983
00:44:19,001 --> 00:44:20,210
a far right wing host.

984
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,550
You've never been a right wing guy and 
it's a.

985
00:44:22,551 --> 00:44:27,080
it's a big misconception like you were 
always totally anti Bush.

986
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:27,914
You've got arrested.
Speaking as actually before Bush was 

987
00:44:30,771 --> 00:44:31,604
even.
You were trying to stop him from being 

988
00:44:33,451 --> 00:44:37,140
elected back when Clinton was in,
when he stole the election from Gore,

989
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:39,990
who I didn't even really like.
I still came out and exposed it and it's

990
00:44:39,991 --> 00:44:42,570
now been certified in Congress and 
they've documented.

991
00:44:42,571 --> 00:44:45,110
I just go with what the facts are,
but you've never been.

992
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,950
One of the things that really opened my 
eyes.

993
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,640
This is a really important video that 
you did nine slash 11 road to tyranny.

994
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,713
We talked about the World Trade 
Organization protests and how they had 

995
00:44:54,541 --> 00:44:59,541
sent in these people in government 
uniforms with government issue boots and

996
00:45:00,571 --> 00:45:03,180
these anarchists.
They were dressed in black and they.

997
00:45:03,181 --> 00:45:07,230
It's that this is an actual tactic that 
they'll use to break up peaceful protest

998
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:07,590
will.

999
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:10,740
They'll send in soldiers or policeman or
whoever the hell they're hiring,

1000
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:13,740
no one knows and they send these people 
and they smash everything up.

1001
00:45:13,741 --> 00:45:14,574
They started to turn into a violent 
protest and light things on fire and 

1002
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:18,414
then they all hold up in a building and 
they negotiated their release and none 

1003
00:45:21,691 --> 00:45:22,524
of them were ever arrested and when you 
showed this clip by clip from these 

1004
00:45:26,461 --> 00:45:27,294
various news organizations and you 
focused on the kind of clothing they're 

1005
00:45:30,301 --> 00:45:31,134
wearing and the difference in their 
behavior versus the behavior of all the 

1006
00:45:33,181 --> 00:45:35,580
peaceful protests,
and then show the result of it,

1007
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,593
which had these people that were walking
to work with a WTO sticker that had a 

1008
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:44,490
line through it and police stopped them 
and said,

1009
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:46,820
you can't have that sticker on that book
bag.

1010
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,400
You committed Beta test for martial law,
and again,

1011
00:45:50,401 --> 00:45:52,230
I'm not anti cops themselves.

1012
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:54,360
The media always spins it.
You expose pedophilia.

1013
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:57,480
They blamed to the pizza place.
You expose the government trying to make

1014
00:45:57,481 --> 00:45:59,420
cops do bad things.
Now you hate everybody.

1015
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:02,610
Not even been comped,
I mean who knows who was doing the Delta

1016
00:46:02,611 --> 00:46:04,260
Force.
That makes sense.

1017
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:07,230
Delta force and I'm blasting Delta 
force.

1018
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,950
They were given an order by Clinton to 
go out and to recruit and they recruited

1019
00:46:10,951 --> 00:46:11,784
just about 400 leftist foundation funded
groups funded by big private 

1020
00:46:15,331 --> 00:46:16,164
foundations.
They trained them for about a month 

1021
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:19,890
before in Oregon.
They flew them there,

1022
00:46:19,891 --> 00:46:21,930
put them in a government housing 
facility.

1023
00:46:21,931 --> 00:46:24,540
This was on the newsletter.
I just covered local news story.

1024
00:46:24,541 --> 00:46:28,620
They did retreat to a building and 
negotiated their surrender and they were

1025
00:46:28,621 --> 00:46:29,670
released.
Yes,

1026
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:30,533
yes,
yes.

1027
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,830
But this was after all this property 
damage.

1028
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:34,763
They went out to start the attack,
so they had it on video so they could 

1029
00:46:38,491 --> 00:46:40,530
then attack the hundred thousand 
peaceful protesters.

1030
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:43,320
So this was something that,
I mean we don't like.

1031
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:46,110
We like to think just like you don't 
like to think that pedophiles are real.

1032
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:48,870
You don't like to think that anyone in 
the government,

1033
00:46:48,871 --> 00:46:49,704
whatever,
organize some kind of an attack or some 

1034
00:46:51,811 --> 00:46:53,370
sort of a,
a,

1035
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:54,833
a fake event where a bunch of people 
that you hire to start smashing things 

1036
00:46:59,101 --> 00:46:59,934
to make a peaceful protest look bad.
We don't want to think that that's 

1037
00:47:01,501 --> 00:47:03,030
possible,
but it is possible.

1038
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:05,520
Goes on,
but it turns out that this is actually a

1039
00:47:05,521 --> 00:47:07,370
documented yet tactic.
Yes,

1040
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:08,940
there was the WTO,
in fact,

1041
00:47:08,941 --> 00:47:12,840
esquire about two years ago,
was doing a profile on me and the guy,

1042
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,953
his dad database,
a former CIA section chief and had been 

1043
00:47:15,571 --> 00:47:17,610
involved a bunch of stuff himself and I 
told him,

1044
00:47:17,611 --> 00:47:18,031
I said,
yeah,

1045
00:47:18,031 --> 00:47:20,190
Delta force ran those riots,
and he goes,

1046
00:47:20,191 --> 00:47:21,024
you're a liar.

1047
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,021
And I said,
no,

1048
00:47:22,021 --> 00:47:22,430
I'm not.
He.

1049
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:23,263
He went and googled it and couldn't 
believe he got the Seattle Post 

1050
00:47:25,501 --> 00:47:26,334
intelligence surge and stuff and then 
even went and talked to a journalist 

1051
00:47:28,801 --> 00:47:29,634
that knew because he'd been there 
covering it as a journalist and he 

1052
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:35,230
didn't even know.
So he says in the esquire article,

1053
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:36,243
okay,
Alex Jones got me there because even 

1054
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:40,390
though I'd grown up in the CIA and 
stuff,

1055
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:41,580
I don't know that was happening,
but,

1056
00:47:41,581 --> 00:47:42,414
but let's be clear,
it's criminal elements using 

1057
00:47:44,141 --> 00:47:44,974
compartmentalization that do this.
They always claim I hate the government 

1058
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:48,790
and I want to have a war and all this 
other stuff.

1059
00:47:48,791 --> 00:47:49,624
No,
I have to give credit to the good 

1060
00:47:51,221 --> 00:47:53,860
elements of the CIA and the good 
elements of the NSA.

1061
00:47:53,861 --> 00:47:54,641
I mean,
I'm good friends.

1062
00:47:54,641 --> 00:47:56,980
That's a very important point.
Very important point.

1063
00:47:56,981 --> 00:47:59,710
I've had this point with a friend of 
mine when we were talking about,

1064
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:00,544
um,
uh,

1065
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:04,720
I've had Mike Baker on the podcast 
before and through the few conversations

1066
00:48:04,721 --> 00:48:06,760
that I've had with Mike Baker is 
formerly the CIA.

1067
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:07,983
I get it.
You start getting an understanding of 

1068
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:10,594
how it works.
Like these drug dealings that always 

1069
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,830
kinda like jets crashing with all the 
coke on board.

1070
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,230
They're cowboys.
You got like a few dudes,

1071
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:18,064
God's run inside sideshows few dudes who
realize they can make a fuck load of 

1072
00:48:21,251 --> 00:48:22,084
money if they sell.
And there might be a lot of people 

1073
00:48:23,741 --> 00:48:25,870
involved,
but it's not the whole CIA.

1074
00:48:25,871 --> 00:48:27,910
It's not like they have government memos
on.

1075
00:48:27,911 --> 00:48:28,744
It.
Will do is they'll have a cover and 

1076
00:48:30,101 --> 00:48:32,260
option they're running.
The president says do this.

1077
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,260
Like Ronald Reagan didn't know about the
cocaine dealing.

1078
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:35,980
I've talked to folks that were involved 
actually for the points.

1079
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:38,350
He says,
I want conesh knocked out congress.

1080
00:48:38,351 --> 00:48:39,550
That'll give them the funding.
They go,

1081
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,500
well you do in the government is you go,
the president said,

1082
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,270
do this.
We're we're men of action.

1083
00:48:43,271 --> 00:48:44,140
We're going to do it.

1084
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,480
So then there's cocaine already being 
sold.

1085
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:49,330
The contracts are using it to get all 
their funding will screw that.

1086
00:48:49,331 --> 00:48:52,360
We'll just jacket bring it in using 
private contractors.

1087
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:56,080
And that wasn't the first time they did 
it for Vietnam.

1088
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,250
Vietnam too.
But yeah,

1089
00:48:57,251 --> 00:48:58,810
it was a.
It was a common tactic.

1090
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:02,320
They knew that there was money that was 
being made from selling illegal drugs.

1091
00:49:02,321 --> 00:49:04,390
Why would they let that money be made 
all around them?

1092
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,630
They're not going to.
That's the argument is you don't want to

1093
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,050
let the communist do all the cocaine and
heroin dealing or the kids,

1094
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:10,610
then they have more money than you.
Well,

1095
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:12,400
what the fuck is going on in 
Afghanistan?

1096
00:49:12,401 --> 00:49:17,401
It's just this crazy people.
How much heroin production went up since

1097
00:49:17,831 --> 00:49:19,800
our occupation?
Anybody can pull this up again.

1098
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:20,643
That's what's frustrating is a lot of 
the fake liberals because I see myself 

1099
00:49:22,661 --> 00:49:24,780
as a real liberal,
but a lot of the fake liberals just go,

1100
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:25,760
oh,
that's a lot of this is like,

1101
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:26,603
no,
you can search engine opium production 

1102
00:49:29,081 --> 00:49:33,130
in Afghanistan pre 2001 and then look at
the latest years.

1103
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:34,870
It's come out in like 2014,
15.

1104
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,620
It went from three percent of world 
supply to seven percent.

1105
00:49:38,621 --> 00:49:43,510
The 30 percent and after 10 years of 
occupation it went to 93 percent.

1106
00:49:43,511 --> 00:49:47,200
Look at mobile supply.
So look at the heck Taylor went from a,

1107
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:49,840
a memory will,
was I right?

1108
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:50,900
Well,
there were.

1109
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:54,160
It's pretty substantial increase between
2001,

1110
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:57,790
which is at an all time low on this 
chart from 94 to 2016.

1111
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,013
So 2000,
one's an all time low and then the next 

1112
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,073
year it fucking skyrocket,
but Google and BBC and ap just type in 

1113
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:10,390
Afghanistan,
90 plus percent world opium production.

1114
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:11,870
It's very,
very hot.

1115
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:16,330
Ninety three percent and listened and 
also for like opiate pills or is it just

1116
00:50:16,331 --> 00:50:17,164
for Jews for everything.
So it's not like oxycontin's and things 

1117
00:50:19,151 --> 00:50:19,984
along those lines that they ordered the 
trips to the Taliban that works with 

1118
00:50:23,531 --> 00:50:24,364
them was allowed to grow it and then 
they're allowed to sell it to whoever 

1119
00:50:26,501 --> 00:50:27,290
wants to buy it.
Well,

1120
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,130
not just that

1121
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:28,963
there's been documented,
confirm instances of troops that are 

1122
00:50:31,791 --> 00:50:33,920
being forced to guard poppy field.
Sure.

1123
00:50:33,921 --> 00:50:34,810
We'll,
we'll let me break it down for it.

1124
00:50:34,811 --> 00:50:38,480
Right when the shorter commitments on 
Fox News with Geraldo Rivera,

1125
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,930
remember that shareable that came out a 
year after I broke it again.

1126
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:42,913
Let me tell you how they work.
It comes out that the trips are being 

1127
00:50:46,851 --> 00:50:47,960
ordered right there.
It goes.

1128
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:48,883
Ninety percent of the world's supply of 
opm according to the United Nations and 

1129
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,040
hit 93 last year.
What?

1130
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:55,580
How many years old is this?
A couple of years.

1131
00:50:55,581 --> 00:50:57,860
Like three years old,
two years old.

1132
00:50:57,861 --> 00:51:00,050
Say It's gone from 93 right now.
Jesus Christ.

1133
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,830
See I didn't lie.
I said 93 and it's not for this.

1134
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:03,711
Yeah.
So,

1135
00:51:03,711 --> 00:51:05,120
but it.
That's what's so frustrating is you know

1136
00:51:05,121 --> 00:51:07,340
all this and then.
And then people still call you crazy.

1137
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:11,240
Now what Alex,
why do explain the fake news cyop why do

1138
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,810
a lot of people out there think info 
wars is total fake news?

1139
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:15,673
Why do they think that?
That is a major deep state government 

1140
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:18,824
program funded by Soros mainly and they 
found the most effective way is anti 

1141
00:51:22,431 --> 00:51:26,660
Israel bashing and so this came out in 
the Wiki leaks last year.

1142
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:27,783
The US intelligence sleep,
not the Russians that he's in there 

1143
00:51:29,361 --> 00:51:30,950
saying,
we're going to overthrow Israel.

1144
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,033
We've got to deal with Saudi Arabia and 
we've got to up the ante with anti 

1145
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,340
Israel rhetoric.
I'm somebody that was neutral in Israel.

1146
00:51:37,341 --> 00:51:39,140
Never been there,
had nothing to do with it.

1147
00:51:39,141 --> 00:51:41,090
Israel has liberals,
conservatives,

1148
00:51:41,091 --> 00:51:42,650
some good administration,
some bad,

1149
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:45,140
but I'm not anti Israel.
It's a tiny little place.

1150
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:47,360
I know it does some things that are bad 
compared to what we've done.

1151
00:51:47,361 --> 00:51:48,194
It's nothing,
so I just don't have some giant hard on 

1152
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:50,570
for Israel,
you know,

1153
00:51:50,571 --> 00:51:51,970
wanting to hurt him and,
and,

1154
00:51:51,971 --> 00:51:53,570
and I'm not against the Palestinians or 
anybody else.

1155
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:54,403
Everybody knows that show show when they
killed Israelis from the reason I say 

1156
00:51:57,801 --> 00:52:00,380
it's wrong when they white phosphorous 
bomb Palestinians,

1157
00:52:00,381 --> 00:52:01,970
I say it's wrong.
Show.

1158
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:02,953
I'm sitting there covering all that and 
then they just put out that I'm this 

1159
00:52:06,351 --> 00:52:07,910
Israeli agent,
you know,

1160
00:52:07,911 --> 00:52:09,710
all day long,
or I'm the CIA.

1161
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:10,863
Let's not get into these crazy rants 
about crazy accusations is why do they 

1162
00:52:14,691 --> 00:52:15,524
think info wars wars is fake news.
I don't know you that a lot of people 

1163
00:52:18,441 --> 00:52:19,550
out there,
smart people,

1164
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,460
really intelligent.
They have.

1165
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:24,530
They think the real news is CNN.
Okay,

1166
00:52:24,531 --> 00:52:25,364
well let me explain.
You've got attached from below and 

1167
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,584
above.
You've got major funding by Soros and 

1168
00:52:30,621 --> 00:52:32,600
others.
There's a real life Nazi collaborator,

1169
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:33,613
like true Dr.
Evil of the latest James Bond was based 

1170
00:52:35,841 --> 00:52:38,770
on his real accompany.
It's even named after his company.

1171
00:52:38,771 --> 00:52:39,900
You don't like the bad guy in the movie.

1172
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,570
He actually Soros,
yeah,

1173
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:44,350
he tried to crash the pound breakdown 
angle and he's really bad nose,

1174
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:47,570
so [inaudible] 18,
but long story short about George Soros,

1175
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,310
he's funding this attack on me and any 
independent media.

1176
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,000
How do you attack independent media when
the public's awake?

1177
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:59,000
The deep state and government stuff.
You say Alex Jones is the government and

1178
00:52:59,001 --> 00:53:01,640
then they always ignore real facts.
I talk about her.

1179
00:53:01,641 --> 00:53:02,474
I admit some of my family and stuff 
that's worked for the government and 

1180
00:53:04,041 --> 00:53:05,660
they said the carpet was corrupted out 
of control.

1181
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:08,180
That isn't even a real debate but.
But above that.

1182
00:53:08,181 --> 00:53:10,970
What was your other question?
He had a with question was.

1183
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,120
Explain the Sol.
Andy,

1184
00:53:14,121 --> 00:53:15,260
let me.
Let me just explain.

1185
00:53:15,261 --> 00:53:17,930
It's pretty easy.
Did their indirect competition with him?

1186
00:53:17,931 --> 00:53:19,820
If it's Fox News,
if it's CNN,

1187
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:21,410
if it's anybody that's distributing 
news,

1188
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:22,453
you're in direct competition with 
someone who has an independent news 

1189
00:53:24,321 --> 00:53:26,030
organization.
They operate it themselves and

1190
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,690
they do it online.
Show just said it perfectly.

1191
00:53:27,691 --> 00:53:28,524
That's it.
Alex is in a very unusual position 

1192
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:31,613
because he's a magnet people to people 
who are drawn to him like a lightening 

1193
00:53:34,651 --> 00:53:36,510
Rod.
He says a lot of crazy shit.

1194
00:53:36,511 --> 00:53:38,220
He goes on rants.
He's very animated.

1195
00:53:38,221 --> 00:53:41,160
He's fun to watch and a lot of this 
shit.

1196
00:53:41,161 --> 00:53:45,120
He says this correct and we're getting 
into this right now like this.

1197
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:47,460
This thing about the WTO,
which was like I said,

1198
00:53:47,461 --> 00:53:49,010
was one of the first ones that really 
opened up my eyes.

1199
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:49,903
That was a long time ago too.
That was like you put that video out in 

1200
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,870
2002 or something like when was that?
Two thousand three.

1201
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:59,930
It was like 2011 right after nine slash 
11 right after September 11th and put it

1202
00:54:01,411 --> 00:54:02,490
on the web router if that.
Exactly.

1203
00:54:02,491 --> 00:54:04,410
I put it out on DVD or something up 
before that.

1204
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:05,243
But you just said it joke.
So let me try to actually thinking 

1205
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,433
codified this then because my problem is
I don't script what I say or that it's 

1206
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,880
kind of all over the map,
which is a good thing or a bad thing.

1207
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:12,923
You just did it on the head.
You ask your question why they call me 

1208
00:54:14,881 --> 00:54:17,760
fake news.
We just saw Megan Kelly two weeks before

1209
00:54:17,761 --> 00:54:20,820
the election,
say in a whole hour long show,

1210
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:23,280
special against fake news.
We've played a few minutes of it.

1211
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,293
Alex Jones is the king of fake nose.
He just said Hillary is chopping up 

1212
00:54:27,001 --> 00:54:29,520
children inside of basement at a pizza 
place.

1213
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:30,541
Now,
granted,

1214
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:33,180
I was saying it in satire about her in 
the Middle East,

1215
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:35,370
so it begged for them to take it out of 
context,

1216
00:54:35,371 --> 00:54:38,010
but they clearly did that to deceive 
their viewers.

1217
00:54:38,011 --> 00:54:40,350
She's branding herself.
I'm real.

1218
00:54:40,351 --> 00:54:42,090
You can trust me.
Look at this.

1219
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:42,923
Poor victim,
Alex Jones almost got him killed when 

1220
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:48,480
none of it was true when none of it was,
you're based in reality.

1221
00:54:48,481 --> 00:54:51,210
And what I,
what I was getting was from the NYP ed.

1222
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:52,830
Okay.
And the FBI,

1223
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,740
who are good people are at least those 
agents show.

1224
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:57,990
There's an example of them branding,
texting it in.

1225
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:02,340
They'll take something real life said.
Or they've taken videos where I'm acting

1226
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:04,000
stupid.
Uh,

1227
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,630
you know,
with like five x six x underwear,

1228
00:55:06,631 --> 00:55:07,464
it,
if they're given the illegals or 

1229
00:55:07,651 --> 00:55:08,484
whatever.
And they'll show them with underwear on 

1230
00:55:09,241 --> 00:55:10,410
my head and say,
look,

1231
00:55:10,411 --> 00:55:11,244
this guy's crazy and I get it.
I cover serious topics so they can take 

1232
00:55:14,131 --> 00:55:15,870
it out of context.
But when I'm being serious,

1233
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:17,670
which is 90 percent of the time I tell 
people,

1234
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:20,250
but when joe comes in and we've got 
joey,

1235
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:21,240
Joey,
now,

1236
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:24,150
Joey Diaz talking about kidnapping 
people,

1237
00:55:24,151 --> 00:55:25,380
I start laughing or whatever.

1238
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:26,213
Yeah,
we had fun.

1239
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,800
Look,
you're a normal person and that's a.

1240
00:55:28,801 --> 00:55:32,820
that's what people find hard to believe.
When I tell people I'm friends with Alex

1241
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:33,001
Jones,
they go,

1242
00:55:33,001 --> 00:55:34,160
get the fuck out of here.
You're Casey.

1243
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:35,640
Great Guy.
Great Guy.

1244
00:55:35,641 --> 00:55:37,390
We have a good time together.
We were very nice show.

1245
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:38,243
You're a great guy.
I switched when we aren't also busy and 

1246
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:42,000
hang out more like I'm the oldest.
I know.

1247
00:55:42,001 --> 00:55:42,870
Well,
we can do it.

1248
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:46,560
I'm going to come back to Austin.
I'm trying to get to Austin probably the

1249
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,110
spring trying to figure out when and 
when and where I'm going to get.

1250
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,273
But uh,
I love Austin where you live as a 

1251
00:55:51,631 --> 00:55:53,100
fucking beautiful place.
Well,

1252
00:55:53,101 --> 00:55:54,540
I know these topics can be,
you know,

1253
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:55,770
quite frankly exhausting.
They are,

1254
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:56,511
they are,
but,

1255
00:55:56,511 --> 00:55:57,344
but I'd like to shove today really get 
into the big picture and what I believe 

1256
00:56:00,871 --> 00:56:01,704
is really going on because I figured out
the basis of what's happening and I'm 

1257
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:05,694
going to let you,
I mean if you wanna hear some far out 

1258
00:56:06,691 --> 00:56:08,850
stuff today,
I think because what you experienced,

1259
00:56:08,851 --> 00:56:09,571
I mean,
I'll go through it.

1260
00:56:09,571 --> 00:56:10,404
Okay,
let's go.

1261
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:12,490
Okay,
let me take a piss then.

1262
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:13,353
Good.
Because Joe's always so slick and 

1263
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:15,510
columns.
So are you,

1264
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,261
Eddie,
me,

1265
00:56:16,261 --> 00:56:17,920
I get in here and I just got another 
round.

1266
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:18,833
We're going to bring you down.
We're going to bring you down to earth 

1267
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:22,320
every now and then you're going to 
launch into orbit.

1268
00:56:22,321 --> 00:56:24,070
We're going to grab you by your heels,
bring

1269
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:25,180
it back.
We're going to be fine.

1270
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:26,014
We'll get through this.
Go take a piss and then tell some crazy 

1271
00:56:27,041 --> 00:56:27,940
shit.
Where's the bathroom?

1272
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:31,680
Right through that door to the right.
Powerful alerts.

1273
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:33,920
Drones so far,
Eddie,

1274
00:56:33,921 --> 00:56:35,770
Bravo.
Everything you wanted and more.

1275
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:36,783
Oh,
absolutely.

1276
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:40,320
I'm just sitting here letting them just 
letting,

1277
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:41,223
letting the people,
letting your fans know that have never 

1278
00:56:44,051 --> 00:56:44,884
listened to him.
I listened to Alex Jones every goddamn 

1279
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,430
day and she'd take a day off every now 
and then.

1280
00:56:48,431 --> 00:56:51,940
Otherwise you'd be like,
fuck bloom.

1281
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,800
Um,
but he's a good guy.

1282
00:56:53,801 --> 00:56:55,300
You know,
he's always been a good guy.

1283
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:56,950
People that don't listen to them,
they,

1284
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,580
they believe what the mainstream media 
has said about us,

1285
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,210
but it's also he makes it easy for them 
by saying crazy shit.

1286
00:57:04,211 --> 00:57:05,044
Like Hillary Clinton chops up babies and
all that stuff and I know he's doing it 

1287
00:57:07,061 --> 00:57:07,894
for dramatic effect and it's one of the 
reasons why show is so popular because 

1288
00:57:10,181 --> 00:57:11,320
he does a lot of things like that.

1289
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:13,660
It makes it easy for people to dismiss 
them.

1290
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:16,030
And then you get into this thing where,
okay,

1291
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,220
let's,
before you dismiss them,

1292
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:19,130
let's look at what he said.
What is.

1293
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:20,860
He said that's true.
And they look at what he said.

1294
00:57:20,861 --> 00:57:24,840
Everything you said today so far,
so far,

1295
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:28,180
everything that he said,
it's just like his radio show.

1296
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:33,500
He doesn't have any teleprompters.
This dude can talk for forever.

1297
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:35,273
That's a thing though,
when you wind up doing a lot of 

1298
00:57:36,431 --> 00:57:38,860
podcasts,
especially doing these radio shows,

1299
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:42,250
shows like Alex says by himself,
we just ranting rants and rents for long

1300
00:57:42,251 --> 00:57:45,070
periods of time.
You develop like a certain muscle,

1301
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:47,770
like there's a lot of guys who do their 
own pod,

1302
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:48,663
like bill burr is a perfect example,
does his own podcast by himself all the 

1303
00:57:50,921 --> 00:57:51,754
time and he's got this ability to go 
just rant from one subject to the next 

1304
00:57:55,871 --> 00:57:56,950
subject and keep going.

1305
00:57:57,070 --> 00:58:00,550
And when you have a podcast it's just,
you just kinda gotta get out of his way.

1306
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:02,980
So with Alex you just kinda gotta feed 
them.

1307
00:58:02,981 --> 00:58:03,814
Some subjects get out of his way,
but every now and then he does so many 

1308
00:58:06,311 --> 00:58:07,930
subjects in a row.
I got to bring them back.

1309
00:58:07,931 --> 00:58:08,764
I gotta go,
you gotTa.

1310
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:10,360
Okay,
let's get to this one.

1311
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,820
How did she steal estates?
You just can't gloss over that.

1312
00:58:12,821 --> 00:58:13,601
Let's get to this.
Okay,

1313
00:58:13,601 --> 00:58:14,850
let's get to it.
Broke it down per.

1314
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:16,180
He did a great job.
Yeah,

1315
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:17,283
and this is a.
I think this is going to help people 

1316
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:20,793
have just seeing Alex like this is going
to help people have a chance to look at 

1317
00:58:26,801 --> 00:58:30,220
this whole picture of just forget about 
where your loyalties lie,

1318
00:58:30,221 --> 00:58:32,530
whether you enjoy CNN or Fox News or 
whatever,

1319
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:33,373
to just sit outside of it right now and 
look at what it really is because what 

1320
00:58:36,941 --> 00:58:40,240
it really is is why is anyone want to 
give you the news?

1321
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:43,690
Are they giving you the news because 
they love you or are they giving you the

1322
00:58:43,691 --> 00:58:44,524
news because it's a program and they're 
trying to make money and do they have 

1323
00:58:47,711 --> 00:58:50,740
access to certain people because they're
willing to play certain games.

1324
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:51,903
Most likely when you're looking at 
something that's on a major league 

1325
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:55,473
television show,
whether it's Fox News or NBC or CBS or 

1326
00:58:58,631 --> 00:58:59,464
whatever the fuck it is,
you had to go through some serious 

1327
00:59:01,211 --> 00:59:05,230
channels to get there.
If you're a guy with a suit and a tie,

1328
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,450
good evening America and you're doing 
that guy,

1329
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:08,613
that guy on any of those major networks,
you've had to go through some fucking 

1330
00:59:11,441 --> 00:59:14,830
serious hoops and ladders and checks and
balances.

1331
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:19,660
You got to represent something in order 
to be the person who reads the news,

1332
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:22,610
but what is that news for?
Is it a fucking show

1333
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:25,520
or is it really the news?
Are they really trying to help you?

1334
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,560
What are they trying to do with?
Why?

1335
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:28,423
Why are they doing the news?
Are they doing it because they love you 

1336
00:59:30,261 --> 00:59:31,094
and care for you and they want you to be
informed or they're doing it because 

1337
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,970
they're clearly biased and they've got 
an agenda?

1338
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:36,223
Well,
if you watch Fox News and then CNN just 

1339
00:59:37,701 --> 00:59:39,590
go back and forth whenever there's 
something going on.

1340
00:59:39,591 --> 00:59:41,900
Like how I did it after the election,
I was like,

1341
00:59:41,901 --> 00:59:42,740
Fox News,
CNN,

1342
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:43,603
Fox News,
CNN.

1343
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:46,340
It's who the fuck is telling the truth.
Someone's gotta be lying.

1344
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:47,323
Why don't you Fox is lying.
One of you is line because there's one 

1345
00:59:49,761 --> 00:59:52,250
story over here and it's a totally 
different story over here,

1346
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:55,040
so all you need to know,
just looking at that,

1347
00:59:55,041 --> 00:59:57,200
just forget about what you are,
whether you're a progressive liberal,

1348
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:58,820
whether you're a conservative 
Republican.

1349
00:59:59,120 --> 00:59:59,953
Just look at that and understand that 
you're getting all of your information 

1350
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:04,723
from these sources that have a vested 
interest in relaying their particular 

1351
01:00:08,391 --> 01:00:09,224
version of the truth.
That's not good for anybody that 

1352
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:14,000
represents the party.
The party like Fox is totally get me one

1353
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:15,980
no matter what kid.
Dude,

1354
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:18,680
come on.
Get one for Eddie Bravo to.

1355
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:20,180
Let's get crazy.
You bring out the hatchets.

1356
01:00:20,181 --> 01:00:21,014
I hope that people listen to your show.
The people that have never given them 

1357
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,940
was a little nervous.
I want to get going for was just do it.

1358
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,020
Bring out the whiskey all I want.
Like for me,

1359
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:34,070
I don't want to be this conspiracy guy 
making money and doing shows.

1360
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:36,940
I walked away from my podcast.
I was talking about conspiracies.

1361
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,320
I really don't want to be that 
conspiracy guy,

1362
01:00:39,321 --> 01:00:41,640
but something inside me,
uh,

1363
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:42,920
is,
uh,

1364
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:44,960
wants to wake people up.

1365
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:46,940
That's all I'm trying to do.
That's all I'm trying to.

1366
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:47,833
I'm trying to help.
I'm not making money off any conspiracy 

1367
01:00:49,401 --> 01:00:52,190
theories or anything.
I tell myself every time I walk in here,

1368
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:55,760
don't say shit about conspiracies.
Whiskeys going to bring it out of him,

1369
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:58,710
Bro.
You know what I'm saying here when there

1370
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:00,230
was a big fan of yet.
Oh cool.

1371
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:02,480
He said he wants to roll with you later.
Oh Shit.

1372
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:03,933
Back Surgery.
So you said so he said so you can kick 

1373
01:01:06,021 --> 01:01:08,640
his ass.
Know Eddie just had a desk replaced.

1374
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:15,200
It's finally time to meet with the CIO,
but every now and then don't you want to

1375
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:18,320
be like on that side and just have half 
full access?

1376
01:01:18,321 --> 01:01:21,860
They don't see.
I don't hold that whiskey hostile.

1377
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:24,170
Alex Jones.
Alright listen,

1378
01:01:24,171 --> 01:01:25,790
let me give you guys the big fricking 
data.

1379
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:28,490
I'm willing to give it to them.
Okay.

1380
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:29,940
I mean I'm not bullshitting.
I got the thing.

1381
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:31,370
Figure it out.
Pour one for Eddie.

1382
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:33,940
I got to figure it out guys.
If you want.

1383
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,420
I mean I'll pour a little.

1384
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:38,750
Alright gentlemen.
Cheers.

1385
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,540
I'm going to keep my mouth cheers to 
you.

1386
01:01:41,541 --> 01:01:42,950
Alex Jones.
Here's a good buddy.

1387
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:46,253
Stuff.
People were so on one side or the other 

1388
01:01:49,401 --> 01:01:50,234
when it comes to this.
There's so much anticipation regarding 

1389
01:01:51,771 --> 01:01:52,670
the.
So much bullying.

1390
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,190
Don't have Alex Jones on it,
but there was a lot of that.

1391
01:01:55,191 --> 01:01:57,410
There's a lot of where you're going to 
call him on his racist shit.

1392
01:01:57,470 --> 01:01:58,303
Someone said that to me,
Alex Jones is one of the least racist 

1393
01:02:01,401 --> 01:02:02,234
people you'll ever meet in your life.
I've never even heard you say a racial 

1394
01:02:05,001 --> 01:02:07,940
thing.
Race is so inconsequential to you.

1395
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:09,710
I'm in what you think and what they 
stand for.

1396
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:13,790
You have never discussed race ever in 
the almost.

1397
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:14,773
What do I know you 16 fucking 17 years.
I've never heard you discuss race at 

1398
01:02:18,441 --> 01:02:19,740
all,
so someone calling you a racist,

1399
01:02:19,741 --> 01:02:20,574
like

1400
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:21,833
what?
You just all they do all trump's waving 

1401
01:02:23,821 --> 01:02:24,654
a rainbow flag and say he's a homophobe.
There was a guy walking next to me in 

1402
01:02:27,421 --> 01:02:29,160
New York.
I was there after the election.

1403
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:30,053
I was there for the UFC.
It was right after the election and me 

1404
01:02:31,531 --> 01:02:33,570
and my friend campaigns are walking back
from the gym.

1405
01:02:33,571 --> 01:02:34,650
We walked,
we went over to the gym,

1406
01:02:34,651 --> 01:02:37,440
we're walking back.
We walked right into the fucking protest

1407
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:41,160
and there was this guy that was standing
next to me screaming,

1408
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:44,100
Donald Trump KKK,
racist,

1409
01:02:44,101 --> 01:02:45,530
sexist.
They had tied gay,

1410
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:47,321
gay,
Gay,

1411
01:02:47,321 --> 01:02:48,420
gay,
racist,

1412
01:02:48,421 --> 01:02:49,680
sexist,
anti gay.

1413
01:02:49,681 --> 01:02:50,514
He just kept screaming it out as Donald 
Trump's in the KKK is if John will 

1414
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,080
trump,
are you sure he's racist?

1415
01:02:55,081 --> 01:02:58,230
Are you sure there's any discrimination 
hires?

1416
01:02:58,231 --> 01:02:59,064
Gay guys are running casinos and hotels 
and is friends with them and like gave 

1417
01:03:01,771 --> 01:03:03,810
interviews with the advocate 20 years 
ago.

1418
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:06,180
It's all just complete.
Made up horse crap.

1419
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:09,390
He's waving a rainbow flag at the RNC 
speech.

1420
01:03:09,391 --> 01:03:10,224
He says,
Republicans have to stop being mean to 

1421
01:03:11,671 --> 01:03:12,504
gay people and have to be inclusive and 
he's about to enforce civil rights laws 

1422
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:19,320
for gays and others and they're calling 
him a literal homophobe.

1423
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:21,840
Then listen all it says my problem 
upside down,

1424
01:03:21,841 --> 01:03:24,970
bs man visit,
but this is my problem with it.

1425
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:27,960
My problem with it is that people want 
to use a real.

1426
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,150
You're a bigot.
You're this,

1427
01:03:30,151 --> 01:03:30,984
you're that.
They want to come up with a nice quick 

1428
01:03:32,431 --> 01:03:33,264
label that officially makes them,
but make sure that it boxes usually 

1429
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,030
finds you and then you have to defend 
yourself.

1430
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:40,013
Look,
you said it best at the beginning of 

1431
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,690
this.
Donald trump is not perfect.

1432
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:45,480
He's a man and he's also a super 
ambitious,

1433
01:03:45,481 --> 01:03:46,314
super wealthy man.
It's constantly on the go and those 

1434
01:03:48,631 --> 01:03:49,464
kinds of dudes are type a hyper 
aggressive personalities and he's 

1435
01:03:52,741 --> 01:03:54,390
definitely said some shit he shouldn't 
have said,

1436
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:55,160
right?

1437
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:55,790
I mean,
don't you agree?

1438
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:56,623
Like third we'll do this.
The big one is one that he said in 

1439
01:04:00,301 --> 01:04:03,510
confidence with that billy Bush guy,
the grab 'em by the pussy thing.

1440
01:04:03,511 --> 01:04:05,670
That's the big one.
Who has it in confidence,

1441
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:07,130
especially if you're famous,
said,

1442
01:04:07,131 --> 01:04:07,771
man,
it's crazy.

1443
01:04:07,771 --> 01:04:09,870
Women throw themselves on you.
You can do anything you want.

1444
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,930
Sexual assault,
a woman's climbing up on top of you.

1445
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:15,120
You can do whatever you want.
That's what mammals do.

1446
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,980
She's showing she wants it.
She gets it.

1447
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:19,850
A sexual assault.
It's pure horse crap.

1448
01:04:19,851 --> 01:04:20,850
Instead of a woman's said,
yeah,

1449
01:04:20,851 --> 01:04:22,350
I just,
I could just see it in their eyes.

1450
01:04:22,351 --> 01:04:24,030
I could just go up and grab them in the 
balls.

1451
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:26,690
We wouldn't.
We wouldn't allow for fucking Briana.

1452
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,970
Briana just talked about how she can 
fuck any got.

1453
01:04:28,971 --> 01:04:30,920
She wants just walks up to him,
grabs by the deck.

1454
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:34,610
We will be like total.
We would think it's amazing.

1455
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:35,493
I started about group is he wasn't 
talking about that he hides behind 

1456
01:04:37,951 --> 01:04:42,780
bushes and reds for joggers reaches out 
and context out of context.

1457
01:04:42,781 --> 01:04:44,810
He's having a guy conversation,
right?

1458
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:49,070
Like he described it as locker room with
the recorder,

1459
01:04:49,071 --> 01:04:51,660
but I know I got this and this is not 
defending it.

1460
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:53,660
I mean,
it's definitely not something you should

1461
01:04:53,661 --> 01:04:54,560
have said probably.
Right.

1462
01:04:54,561 --> 01:04:57,690
We could all agree to that,
but what is he really doing?

1463
01:04:57,691 --> 01:04:58,524
He's really what we call talk and shit 
like Eddie Talk Shit so much to each of 

1464
01:05:03,331 --> 01:05:06,450
the laughing saying things we totally 
don't believe.

1465
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:07,373
We totally don't mean,
but we're trying to make each other 

1466
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:10,950
eventually.
We're Lee.

1467
01:05:10,951 --> 01:05:11,784
Eddie and I are silly all the time.
You had a transcript of all the 

1468
01:05:13,861 --> 01:05:17,290
conversations.
You and I have had a fucking 17 years.

1469
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:18,880
We've been friends.
Oh Shit.

1470
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:20,920
We'd be in trouble.
Can't put it on air.

1471
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:21,863
We'd be in fucking real trouble.
Real content on facebook mentions into 

1472
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:26,150
that live video.
You doesn't mean.

1473
01:05:26,151 --> 01:05:28,210
It's so funny watching the stupid TV 
show.

1474
01:05:28,211 --> 01:05:29,044
Oh my God.
That show was awesome and then as soon 

1475
01:05:29,891 --> 01:05:31,570
as I turned the camera on,
you wouldn't say all that stuff,

1476
01:05:31,571 --> 01:05:32,740
but it wasn't.
None of it was bad,

1477
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:34,550
but it was like off the cuff weren't,
you know,

1478
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:35,403
you weren't censoring while I forgot 
what I said to a lot of marijuana 

1479
01:05:38,711 --> 01:05:42,400
involved in this conversation.
Go on forever.

1480
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:44,320
Jesus.
I'll put these off.

1481
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,540
You don't like them.
You don't have to wear it so loud.

1482
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:49,210
You don't have to worry about it.
Alex Jones,

1483
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:50,770
who's here.
Seriously,

1484
01:05:50,771 --> 01:05:55,510
I just want to do a good job and 
actually reached out to your 100 and 110

1485
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:58,480
million.
Who knows how many downloads a month?

1486
01:05:58,690 --> 01:05:59,523
20 million on Youtube.
All the derivatives and everything else 

1487
01:06:00,941 --> 01:06:02,490
you're doing and I hear you sometimes on
Xm.

1488
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,540
He still doing that?
No,

1489
01:06:03,570 --> 01:06:04,670
no,
I'm not on the XML.

1490
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,880
Whatever the point is is that you're one
of the biggest shows in the world.

1491
01:06:06,881 --> 01:06:08,560
Let me give you a newsflash,
not for your ego.

1492
01:06:08,561 --> 01:06:09,430
Okay,
but you need to know this.

1493
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:12,460
I don't see that as a signal to the 
mainstream media of apathetic.

1494
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:16,140
They are in top show has maybe a million
viewers there.

1495
01:06:16,141 --> 01:06:18,820
Average show about 100,000.
Fox was top show,

1496
01:06:18,821 --> 01:06:20,290
maybe 4 million to nine on a bigger 
night.

1497
01:06:20,291 --> 01:06:20,711
Okay,
great.

1498
01:06:20,711 --> 01:06:22,180
Good for them.
I'm not in competition with them.

1499
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:25,150
The point is there a freaking joke.
I conservatively,

1500
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:26,253
everyday on terrestrial radio have $4 
million listeners on my 200 plus 

1501
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:30,550
stations.
That's rated proven.

1502
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:35,140
I mean that's big right there and then 
millions and millions of downloads every

1503
01:06:35,141 --> 01:06:35,974
day.
Tens of millions of people watching the 

1504
01:06:36,761 --> 01:06:37,510
videos.

1505
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:39,550
You've added all together 40 something 
million a week.

1506
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,860
We go back to this.
What's happening?

1507
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:43,990
It isn't about Joe Rogan or Alex Jones 
Ready,

1508
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:44,843
Bravo or any of that.
It's about the people are hungry for 

1509
01:06:47,021 --> 01:06:49,300
being able to have a wider selection of 
things.

1510
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:50,293
When you and I are totally different 
categories because all I'm trying to do 

1511
01:06:52,451 --> 01:06:56,500
is give them interesting content.
You're actually trying to run a new show

1512
01:06:56,501 --> 01:06:58,750
and expose to some really smart 
commentary.

1513
01:06:58,751 --> 01:07:00,790
I'll watch clips all the time.
I have people on all the time.

1514
01:07:00,810 --> 01:07:03,450
It's just you try to open minds all the 
time,

1515
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:06,520
open mind the different way.
I meant to say that what I'm not,

1516
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:08,650
I'm not honestly not trying to open 
minds,

1517
01:07:08,651 --> 01:07:09,484
I'm being curious and I'm asking 
questions and I'm trying to learn as 

1518
01:07:11,651 --> 01:07:14,140
much myself and then once I do learn 
about things,

1519
01:07:14,141 --> 01:07:17,080
I would like to have that person come on
to teach other people about it because I

1520
01:07:17,081 --> 01:07:17,800
think it's interesting.

1521
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,420
Well,
here's the big Enchilada for folks.

1522
01:07:19,421 --> 01:07:20,254
If you want to lay the sound Chilada 
documentary down the road and actually 

1523
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:26,013
break this down,
but there is a whole breakaway 

1524
01:07:29,021 --> 01:07:33,310
civilization and I'm listening to Ufo 
getting ready.

1525
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:36,130
I don't ever talk about this for real 
breakaway civilization.

1526
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,300
Are you ready?
Hold on.

1527
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:41,080
Joe.
How many things that I tell you over the

1528
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,040
years?
Too many to many.

1529
01:07:42,041 --> 01:07:44,380
That came true.
That was a couple that you got wrong.

1530
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:45,730
You can't get them all right.
Which one?

1531
01:07:45,731 --> 01:07:48,130
Two K people.
The context.

1532
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:51,300
My list from that explained the white.
It's okay.

1533
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:54,250
A conspiracy theory.
It's just not trusting criminals.

1534
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:57,190
Every now and then you can in that 
murder to the criminal,

1535
01:07:57,191 --> 01:07:59,410
but he still a criminal even though 
you're wrong.

1536
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,273
Well,
one of the things that I'm actually 

1537
01:08:00,611 --> 01:08:02,580
embarrassed about is the y two k.
oh,

1538
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:03,700
well,
hey listen,

1539
01:08:03,701 --> 01:08:05,500
you're not a consumer.
You're not a computer expert.

1540
01:08:05,501 --> 01:08:07,120
Near My.
I didn't go anywhere that night.

1541
01:08:07,270 --> 01:08:10,120
I stayed home and I was waiting for that
God damn power to go out,

1542
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:13,180
have some big news in a minute,
but since any rather than 12,

1543
01:08:13,181 --> 01:08:14,890
I didn't know.
I thought damn the Mayans.

1544
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,190
No,
we thought it was over.

1545
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:20,600
I didn't think that any problem.
And I was convinced 200,012

1546
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:24,970
licensed to December 2012 licensed.
I did.

1547
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:25,873
Oh,
just tobacco.

1548
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:27,890
Yes.
Very strong tobacco from Mexico.

1549
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:28,281
Oh,
sorry.

1550
01:08:28,281 --> 01:08:29,750
I'm in California.
This is for medical reason.

1551
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:31,880
Hundred 100 percent medical reasons and 
legal.

1552
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,181
Um,
yeah,

1553
01:08:33,181 --> 01:08:34,014
I mean there's still,
there's a lot of things if people think 

1554
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:36,980
are going to happen that turned out to 
not happen.

1555
01:08:36,981 --> 01:08:38,960
There's always a goddamn asteroid.
It's going to kill us all.

1556
01:08:38,970 --> 01:08:42,580
That doesn't actually.
It's important to not inhale.

1557
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,740
So what?
What is going on?

1558
01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:47,250
Aliens are coming.
Let me hear it.

1559
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,560
Let me,
before I do this,

1560
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,240
let me answer his question because he 
got it.

1561
01:08:50,241 --> 01:08:52,800
Reagan question to,
well,

1562
01:08:53,010 --> 01:08:54,940
let me answer y two k because I want to 
be bit honest about this.

1563
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:56,753
This was one of the few things that debt
I have really gotten wrong and I didn't 

1564
01:09:01,821 --> 01:09:06,050
go with my gut and so I was proven wrong
and I did it for the wrong reason.

1565
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:08,300
So now I'm going to actually confess,
your honor,

1566
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:12,440
I was on one radio station.
I've been on TV for a few years.

1567
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:13,483
I was on one radio station already 
started to show it to my house that was 

1568
01:09:15,501 --> 01:09:17,360
on like 15 radio stations,
so I had that at least,

1569
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:18,194
but I was on one big radio station,
had the top show at night station with 

1570
01:09:21,591 --> 01:09:23,690
Howard stern was killer,
was all over the newspaper,

1571
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:26,030
had huge ratings and I was bringing in 
like,

1572
01:09:26,031 --> 01:09:26,331
you know,
20,

1573
01:09:26,331 --> 01:09:28,340
30 grand a month,
which was just a huge amount for me.

1574
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:30,140
Building whole operation out of that at 
home.

1575
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:33,290
And they come to the sales guys and they
go look for a year.

1576
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:34,124
You've not been behind y twoK and you're
not letting us have all these big 

1577
01:09:37,071 --> 01:09:37,904
sponsors and you're gonna basically be 
fired if you don't let us endorse these 

1578
01:09:41,721 --> 01:09:43,280
sponsors and have them on errands.

1579
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:45,230
Say You believe in y two k hold on a 
second.

1580
01:09:45,231 --> 01:09:46,064
So these sponsors were like doomsday 
stuff like canned food and shit and 

1581
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:49,880
bunkers.
Everything else.

1582
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:54,900
So stacy wants to make all this money so
the station made you push y two k y.

1583
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:02,983
But let me go further.
This is one of the few times in my life 

1584
01:10:04,161 --> 01:10:06,110
that I don't want to say I didn't have 
integrity.

1585
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:07,213
I kinda let them convince me.
But I think back to the point in the 

1586
01:10:09,201 --> 01:10:12,350
conference room I just Kinda went okay,
okay,

1587
01:10:12,351 --> 01:10:12,831
okay,
sure.

1588
01:10:12,831 --> 01:10:13,880
I get it.
And then I went.

1589
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:16,940
And then once I decided it was true,
I really pushed it.

1590
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:18,133
So it's almost like I lied to myself yet
because I'm being honest about this 

1591
01:10:19,821 --> 01:10:20,654
process.
So.

1592
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:23,600
So this is what happened for like a year
and a half.

1593
01:10:23,601 --> 01:10:24,434
I'm saying it's bs,
it's a government hoax because they're 

1594
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,624
like,
the navy says the chips are all bad and 

1595
01:10:27,861 --> 01:10:30,830
54 cities will completely fall and it's 
all the death.

1596
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:31,663
And I said they just want to upgrade 
with all this new spy hubs and when a 

1597
01:10:34,161 --> 01:10:34,994
new global standardization for the US,
it's the telecommunications act of 

1598
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:38,144
[inaudible] 96,
they want to force all the new chips 

1599
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,750
because I had an NSA sources that I was 
having on.

1600
01:10:41,751 --> 01:10:42,584
Okay.
And I didn't realize how special it was 

1601
01:10:44,461 --> 01:10:47,300
that I had these sources and they're 
telling me it's all bs people.

1602
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:48,143
I don't argue with the navy and don't.
Art and Fox News had ads to get your 

1603
01:10:50,781 --> 01:10:51,950
food.
It was just everywhere.

1604
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:54,260
Someone kill.
Okay,

1605
01:10:54,261 --> 01:10:55,094
stuff's going to be real.
So it's like a black Friday for black 

1606
01:10:58,251 --> 01:11:01,830
Friday sale.
So the last few months and the moral was

1607
01:11:01,831 --> 01:11:03,410
they ended up firing me anyways.
They did.

1608
01:11:03,411 --> 01:11:05,900
But the moral was,
I kind of convinced myself it was real.

1609
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,940
So by the end of it,
and of course they edit it like,

1610
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,400
you know,
12 hours and beyond that day,

1611
01:11:09,450 --> 01:11:10,130
like five minutes.

1612
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:10,963
I'm totally insane.
But it's like nuclear reactor having a 

1613
01:11:12,861 --> 01:11:14,700
problem here and it really was happening
and like,

1614
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:15,870
you know,
oh,

1615
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:16,704
and there was a missile fired from 
Russia which was an icbm and they got 

1616
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:21,360
shot down.
That was ABC News.

1617
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:22,500
So I'm like,
alright,

1618
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:24,000
this isn't really happening.
Okay.

1619
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:25,850
Know we got prepared.
It's always good to prepare,

1620
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:27,360
but hopefully I'll get a reactor is 
having a problem.

1621
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:28,290
Okay.
Some stuff's that.

1622
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:33,120
There was some outages and problems,
but government and MSM had hyped it.

1623
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:36,300
Then they used it to demonize 
alternative media.

1624
01:11:36,301 --> 01:11:41,301
Even then when it wasn't catastrophic.
So my gut told me it was bs.

1625
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:45,570
It was bs.
And so thank God I missed the whole 2012

1626
01:11:45,571 --> 01:11:47,430
thing.
But still they said,

1627
01:11:47,431 --> 01:11:48,264
Alex Jones says the world's ending the 
bureau 2012 where he really starts when 

1628
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,073
I say it's all a load of crap,
but I didn't criticize you when I saw 

1629
01:11:54,721 --> 01:11:56,280
you doing it.
I said I was balls deep.

1630
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:59,310
And here's the thing.

1631
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:03,690
It wasn't,
it was the listers.

1632
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:07,050
They were pissed at me that I wouldn't 
go into this thing.

1633
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:08,700
But it's fun for them.
See,

1634
01:12:08,701 --> 01:12:09,534
when you start talking about the end of 
the world are doomsday come and people 

1635
01:12:12,091 --> 01:12:14,670
like that shit because it gives them 
something to think about,

1636
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:19,100
but I guess here's a lot of people out 
future you.

1637
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:21,990
It was a long time ago,
17 years ago,

1638
01:12:21,991 --> 01:12:22,561
right?
Y,

1639
01:12:22,561 --> 01:12:25,240
twoK ,
17 fucking years ago at least 2012.

1640
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:30,470
Didn't get you redeemed yourself.
You can think about 17 years ago.

1641
01:12:32,521 --> 01:12:33,354
That's a long time ago.
I mean in you getting fired from that 

1642
01:12:36,091 --> 01:12:38,160
job.
Every great radio guys gotten fired.

1643
01:12:38,290 --> 01:12:41,840
You Howard stern got fired.
You got fired like public loves,

1644
01:12:41,841 --> 01:12:43,710
but it was just like Howard stern fire 
man,

1645
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:45,810
top ratings,
and they were all pissed and weird about

1646
01:12:45,811 --> 01:12:47,370
it.
The weird thing is they didn't mess with

1647
01:12:47,371 --> 01:12:48,204
the losers.

1648
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:50,700
They were all flipping out because I was
getting the big paychecks.

1649
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:52,320
Well,
it makes sense.

1650
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:53,933
It was the same day and the y two k 
thing totally makes sense that they 

1651
01:12:56,191 --> 01:12:57,024
would want you to really push that and 
sell it hard because he the fuck the 

1652
01:12:58,651 --> 01:12:59,251
hoes,
you know,

1653
01:12:59,251 --> 01:13:00,570
we don't know.
You get scared.

1654
01:13:00,571 --> 01:13:01,404
You're like,
well,

1655
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:03,713
the navy says it's going to happen in 
Washington Post now your listers are 

1656
01:13:06,571 --> 01:13:07,650
real,
and it was the one time I went,

1657
01:13:07,690 --> 01:13:08,371
oh,
okay,

1658
01:13:08,371 --> 01:13:09,204
maybe I'll go do it.
I had people on there were telling me 

1659
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,500
there was something that was going to 
happen on 2012.

1660
01:13:13,501 --> 01:13:14,650
They were sure of it.
Yeah,

1661
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:20,280
not a bullied by doing it.
You started stampeding like limits.

1662
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:22,860
I'm telling you this,
a psychological going on,

1663
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:27,810
just massive double crossing because I 
really used to be in the Ufos,

1664
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:30,750
but the more you look into the Ufo is it
looks like,

1665
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,500
and that's another conspiracy.

1666
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:33,953
Looks like the government NASA deal.
And when he came into the meeting he 

1667
01:13:39,211 --> 01:13:40,044
couldn't do it.
I knew this guy well and then the next 

1668
01:13:41,641 --> 01:13:42,690
time he was going to meet with me,
he.

1669
01:13:42,691 --> 01:13:44,940
His heart blew up.
It blew up.

1670
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:46,950
Yeah,
like a bomb.

1671
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:49,770
They said his heart completely ruptured.
Well,

1672
01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:50,683
the point is,
his name was Raymond t and if you look 

1673
01:13:53,281 --> 01:13:54,114
at mission control,
he was the main guy as you control the 

1674
01:13:56,221 --> 01:13:57,480
control,
the cameras and everything.

1675
01:13:58,290 --> 01:14:00,480
And he,
he was house.

1676
01:14:00,481 --> 01:14:02,340
He had national security letters from 
the president.

1677
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:05,550
He'd run like secret operations in 
Cambodia and Laos.

1678
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:08,180
He was an air force engineer and uh,
he,

1679
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:09,043
he knew the whole deal and he would say,
what whole day would you say to meet 

1680
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:11,980
with you and tell you everything?
And he would

1681
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,790
come and start gulping and he couldn't 
get it out,

1682
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:16,713
couldn't get one out.
He said he was so threatened or 

1683
01:14:18,611 --> 01:14:19,444
whatever.
He couldn't tell me about you think 

1684
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:21,970
about it.
He probably,

1685
01:14:21,971 --> 01:14:26,971
he probably left and he was in the car.
Raymond was telling me a lot.

1686
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:29,351
He said,
Alex,

1687
01:14:29,351 --> 01:14:32,440
your sources are right.
There were advanced technologies.

1688
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:34,660
We were worried the astronauts might 
die.

1689
01:14:34,661 --> 01:14:37,780
They had two teams in orbit.
One would the real ships.

1690
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:39,040
This is not a joke,
Joe.

1691
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:40,143
Wait a minute.
They had one wheel pose in an orbit and 

1692
01:14:43,271 --> 01:14:45,490
they were communicating with Kennedy and
the government.

1693
01:14:45,491 --> 01:14:47,990
Everybody and Nixon are gonna have this 
giant thing about Americans,

1694
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:50,560
number one and not have a backup plan of
the astronauts die.

1695
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:52,483
Uh,
put those headphones back on and lost 

1696
01:14:53,771 --> 01:14:55,940
your fucking mind,
Scott,

1697
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:57,270
you into a corner.
Hold on,

1698
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,890
let him finish there.
So tell me what you're trying to say.

1699
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:00,753
Are you trying to say that?
So the United States government cheek 

1700
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:07,210
was going to give me the secret of NASA.
Okay.

1701
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:09,760
And then he couldn't ever get it out.
He would get an order.

1702
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:13,940
Now the second program,
they had a second program,

1703
01:15:13,941 --> 01:15:14,774
but how do you know he died?
And he told me before the heart attack 

1704
01:15:18,190 --> 01:15:21,420
in the middle of the hard time second.
No,

1705
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,273
no.
I met with him at the old sat command 

1706
01:15:23,681 --> 01:15:24,514
base.
What did he actually tell you for work 

1707
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:27,721
or not?
What?

1708
01:15:27,721 --> 01:15:28,930
What He.
He told me.

1709
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:30,910
He said you're,
you said from your analysis,

1710
01:15:30,911 --> 01:15:32,020
your sources.
You're dead on.

1711
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:37,540
I was in control of the video and radio 
communications and he was the Yoda Gvs.

1712
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:38,793
Watch him on TV.
I mean it's very important that guy 

1713
01:15:40,721 --> 01:15:45,220
controlling the Canada mission control 
the two backups behind that.

1714
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:46,690
Are you kidding?
Of course.

1715
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:48,700
The,
the moon landings.

1716
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:49,780
Are you kidding?
Come on.

1717
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:50,591
Well,
you raised it.

1718
01:15:50,591 --> 01:15:51,880
You want them to know.
Oh,

1719
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:53,710
come on.
That's ridiculous.

1720
01:15:53,730 --> 01:15:54,563
No,
but that's why I don't trust the 

1721
01:15:55,031 --> 01:15:57,120
government.
That's why I don't trust it because they

1722
01:15:57,121 --> 01:16:00,010
ran,
they didn't want to spend money,

1723
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:05,040
they ran a fake cop was just reentry 
devices and basic stuff in space and did

1724
01:16:05,351 --> 01:16:06,184
shoot some of it,
but then they had a real mission that 

1725
01:16:08,051 --> 01:16:09,430
put the reflectors,
everything on the moon.

1726
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:10,870
We went to the moon.
But there's no proof of that.

1727
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,730
So you believe.
Well,

1728
01:16:12,731 --> 01:16:13,564
you know that the uh,
the Russian government with the secret 

1729
01:16:16,331 --> 01:16:17,350
space program,
Alex,

1730
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:20,230
you know that the Russian government,
you know that the Russian government put

1731
01:16:20,231 --> 01:16:21,064
those lasers sight,
those laser reflectors on the moon as 

1732
01:16:22,931 --> 01:16:24,560
well with unmanned probes.
Yes.

1733
01:16:24,561 --> 01:16:26,320
You know that right now there's still 
Chinese.

1734
01:16:26,321 --> 01:16:28,660
The Chinese have a bunch.
So that's not like the,

1735
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,200
there's,
there's,

1736
01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:31,540
there's weird evidence.

1737
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:34,840
He went to them things that far away.
Just kidding.

1738
01:16:35,150 --> 01:16:36,370
Are you kidding?
This Alex,

1739
01:16:36,371 --> 01:16:37,660
you think they definitely went to the 
moon?

1740
01:16:37,690 --> 01:16:38,950
They're just.
The footage is fake.

1741
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:39,933
Is that what she thinks?
You can't bring film back to the Van 

1742
01:16:42,290 --> 01:16:43,240
Allen Radiation Belt to get spots all 
over it,

1743
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:44,463
but we don't have film.
What would lead us to believe that they 

1744
01:16:46,031 --> 01:16:48,610
definitely did it because they had rca 
cameras.

1745
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,700
There was interest on the amazing 
footage,

1746
01:16:51,701 --> 01:16:52,534
right?
Does amazing footage launch in space in 

1747
01:16:55,421 --> 01:16:56,254
case the real mission died.
So who's in the fake loan should show 

1748
01:16:58,870 --> 01:17:00,480
you the real deal.
What happened?

1749
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:05,100
Is there anything?
US military is in advance.

1750
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:06,250
Okay.
Okay.

1751
01:17:06,251 --> 01:17:07,540
But let's let him go.
Let him answer this.

1752
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:09,980
Heady.
So we gotta you got to figure this out.

1753
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:14,690
So what you're saying is the one that we
saw on TV with Neil Armstrong,

1754
01:17:14,691 --> 01:17:17,310
one small step for man,
that's all horse shit.

1755
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:21,590
But the real one actually took place.
They just couldn't get the film back.

1756
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:24,320
But Armstrong had been on real missions.
So yes,

1757
01:17:24,321 --> 01:17:26,220
he definitely been unreal missions but 
had.

1758
01:17:26,230 --> 01:17:26,631
No,
no,

1759
01:17:26,631 --> 01:17:29,630
he wouldn't tell me all of it.
He died before we met.

1760
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:30,823
The other dude was out on him the next 
day and his wife called my dad was 

1761
01:17:33,261 --> 01:17:34,190
friends with him.
They said,

1762
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:35,240
no,
no.

1763
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:36,440
The other guy.
What's his name?

1764
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:38,300
Buzz Aldrin.
I do no buzz Aldrin.

1765
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:41,030
Buzz Aldrin said,
I want to come on your show and I and I,

1766
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:43,640
I'm not gonna get into all that heat.
Oh know he lives here in La and one time

1767
01:17:43,641 --> 01:17:45,980
I ran into them but I'll just leave it 
at that and he said,

1768
01:17:45,981 --> 01:17:47,210
I want to come on your show.
I said,

1769
01:17:47,211 --> 01:17:48,044
all right,
well come on.

1770
01:17:48,570 --> 01:17:50,120
It's the only interview he said,
and he goes,

1771
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:52,460
I'm going to tell you Alex,
your audience alone.

1772
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:55,670
He said there is an envelope just like 
2001.

1773
01:17:56,030 --> 01:17:56,863
It's on the Moon of Mars,
the moon and it sending a transmission 

1774
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:02,383
and it's all real and it's all Egypt and
there's aliens and everything else and 

1775
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:07,580
it's the only time he ever said it.
What?

1776
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:12,660
Is there a clip of that pull up?
Buzz Aldrin up.

1777
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,540
Pull that clip.
Dude.

1778
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:16,910
It was online.
ABC News the next day.

1779
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:19,650
So you see that.
Do you think he was fucking with him?

1780
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:21,450
Do you think he's fucking with you know,
he was real.

1781
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:24,950
He's a feisty fella.
I think he's full of Shit.

1782
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:26,660
Why do you think he's full of Shit?
What if it's true?

1783
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:27,743
He imagined there is an obelisk on Mars.
I think that's really is communicating 

1784
01:18:31,311 --> 01:18:32,144
with an obelisk on the moon and Mars.
The Moon of Mars Phobos is that we got 

1785
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:37,430
to land there.
Did have been seen as instagram,

1786
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:42,040
but that was a good lot of bitches.
Amazing boats to follow him.

1787
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,640
Poaches and bitches and boats.
He's just like,

1788
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:47,240
he's this.
Okay,

1789
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:50,240
well let's take it.
Let's give some loving instagram.

1790
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:51,253
Let's give some

1791
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:52,313
with their habitation.
We can keep track if there's something 

1792
01:18:54,891 --> 01:18:57,560
very important to be developed from the 
moon.

1793
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:00,310
I'm not sure what it is right now.
Of course you don't.

1794
01:19:00,530 --> 01:19:01,051
Sure.
Thanks.

1795
01:19:01,051 --> 01:19:03,110
Should identify it for.

1796
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:04,333
Well,
the truth.

1797
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:04,921
No,
no,

1798
01:19:04,921 --> 01:19:05,754
no.
I want to hear what he's doing here 

1799
01:19:06,170 --> 01:19:07,350
about.
I want to hear,

1800
01:19:07,351 --> 01:19:09,660
but I want to hear what he says first.
Let's see what he says.

1801
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:10,891
Hold it.
Hold it.

1802
01:19:10,891 --> 01:19:11,724
Go ahead.
Jamie.

1803
01:19:11,730 --> 01:19:12,563
America.
To make such gross expenditures again 

1804
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:18,030
for human habitation on a boat,
we can help.

1805
01:19:18,270 --> 01:19:19,103
We can join with together.
We can explore the moon and develop the 

1806
01:19:24,271 --> 01:19:24,931
movement.
Still.

1807
01:19:24,931 --> 01:19:26,680
Tax Money.
Go do it together.

1808
01:19:26,770 --> 01:19:29,250
Oh,
Bill Shan has not gone before this where

1809
01:19:29,251 --> 01:19:34,251
he talks about that we need to go to a 
monolith there.

1810
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:41,540
A very unusual structure,
little potato shaped object.

1811
01:19:41,551 --> 01:19:45,090
We need $4,000,000
to in seven hours.

1812
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,790
Find out about that.
They're going to say,

1813
01:19:47,791 --> 01:19:49,710
who put that there?
Who put that there?

1814
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:54,030
Well,
the universe put it there.

1815
01:19:54,031 --> 01:19:57,240
If you choose combine and put it there.
Come on

1816
01:19:58,150 --> 01:20:02,180
wants $4,000,000,000.
Oh my God.

1817
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:04,580
So that's the monolith.
That thing that you're looking at at.

1818
01:20:04,630 --> 01:20:05,620
Wow.
That's weird.

1819
01:20:05,650 --> 01:20:06,483
I don't believe that shit for a second.
Let me tell you about Buzz Aldrin here 

1820
01:20:10,651 --> 01:20:12,510
in Los Angeles and I can't tell you 
anything else.

1821
01:20:12,570 --> 01:20:15,990
Okay.
Look at this monolith on Phobos.

1822
01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:17,370
Weird.
Yeah.

1823
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,290
That's took a weird structure.
Who knows?

1824
01:20:19,291 --> 01:20:20,770
That's a real picture.
That's all bullshit.

1825
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:22,940
It's all bullshit.
Come on.

1826
01:20:23,290 --> 01:20:24,123
Yeah,
that,

1827
01:20:24,270 --> 01:20:25,990
that proves it.
Planes are all bullshit.

1828
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:26,863
I can.
I don't know shit about photoshop and I 

1829
01:20:28,201 --> 01:20:30,350
can make that.
I'm sure you can.

1830
01:20:30,351 --> 01:20:35,351
I tell you the big secret about my 
secret meeting with me here.

1831
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:38,500
The shitty fed.
You let me know.

1832
01:20:38,530 --> 01:20:41,640
Eddie don't sign.
Let's go ahead and let him communicate.

1833
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:47,400
He told me that Papa SMURF has for you.
I'll show you what he told me.

1834
01:20:48,990 --> 01:20:51,360
He told me,
he said,

1835
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:55,500
you know India is sending a probe to the
moon and they'll announce that when they

1836
01:20:55,501 --> 01:20:56,334
crashed the probe,
they found the undersea frozen ice that 

1837
01:20:59,311 --> 01:21:00,000
covers the moon.

1838
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,040
The moon has dust on it.
It's a big water bowl.

1839
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:04,200
It's gonna be the water we need to get 
off the planet.

1840
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:06,460
We make our big jump.
So the whole point is,

1841
01:21:06,461 --> 01:21:08,490
suppose everything's laid on the planet 
just perfect for humanity.

1842
01:21:08,491 --> 01:21:10,380
We make the steps right,
but it's like a video game.

1843
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:12,120
Puzzle and highlight.
Fuck,

1844
01:21:13,190 --> 01:21:14,100
Buzz Aldrin.
No,

1845
01:21:14,101 --> 01:21:16,960
you're not listening.
He's fucking crash.

1846
01:21:16,990 --> 01:21:17,823
The proud found exactly what they were 
saying and I'm walking through an 

1847
01:21:20,371 --> 01:21:22,530
airport or later to look over and it 
says,

1848
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:25,860
it says India discovers water on the 
moon and it's all water.

1849
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:26,843
Well,
they've definitely discovered water on 

1850
01:21:27,331 --> 01:21:27,870
the moon.
Right?

1851
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:32,870
That's what they told me about it a year
before he sat.

1852
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:34,254
Right?
Am I correct in saying there's no water 

1853
01:21:35,530 --> 01:21:36,363
in the moment saying Buzz Aldrin?
Is he going to the meetings and they 

1854
01:21:39,721 --> 01:21:41,100
tell them shit.
Listen,

1855
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:41,761
he.
Yeah,

1856
01:21:41,761 --> 01:21:42,440
he went to the moon.

1857
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:45,210
You want to get to go to every meeting.
I don't get into all this stuff.

1858
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:46,813
I'm telling you.
Was older told me in a year it's going 

1859
01:21:50,061 --> 01:21:50,894
to be on the news that they discovered 
water with a probe or setting before 

1860
01:21:52,981 --> 01:21:54,600
they were even sending a probe in the 
news.

1861
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:58,110
They left India quote,
find it because the US already found it.

1862
01:21:58,111 --> 01:22:00,750
It's already been on the moon.
God knows how many times the word is.

1863
01:22:00,751 --> 01:22:02,380
They got military bases on the other 
side.

1864
01:22:02,670 --> 01:22:06,330
Alex was in the fifties.
What do you think we got now?

1865
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:07,650
So you think they have new?
Wait a minute.

1866
01:22:07,651 --> 01:22:09,130
They have bases on the moon.
Well,

1867
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:10,680
I don't ever get into all of this stuff,
right?

1868
01:22:11,070 --> 01:22:13,410
Don't do that.
But let's just say it's super advanced.

1869
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:16,350
You really think that they have some 
sort of a base out there and he's like,

1870
01:22:16,351 --> 01:22:19,320
I told you one,
a key word that's so far away.

1871
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,600
Why wouldn't they just do it in a desert
somewhere?

1872
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:22,673
What is this?
Am I p detected water on the moon way 

1873
01:22:26,671 --> 01:22:28,410
back in June.
Huh?

1874
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,960
It dropping dissemble on you,
Alex.

1875
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:33,210
let me.
Buzz Aldrin tells me they're gonna.

1876
01:22:33,211 --> 01:22:35,070
Announce India finds water.
Oh my God.

1877
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:36,413
Follow him on instagram and then come 
back to me with some bizarre probe with 

1878
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:42,090
Buzz Aldrin.
Me.

1879
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:44,310
Look at this.
The moon impact probe.

1880
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:47,790
Which class crashed,
landed at a designated site on the lunar

1881
01:22:47,791 --> 01:22:50,070
South Pole on November 14,
2008.

1882
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:51,433
I had picked up some clear signatures of
water during the five minutes to say 

1883
01:22:54,620 --> 01:22:55,610
crash it.
Yeah.

1884
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:56,453
Mr.
Nair said at a press conference here on 

1885
01:22:57,601 --> 01:23:00,150
Friday.
Interesting when it comes to space,

1886
01:23:00,151 --> 01:23:01,570
Alex.
um,

1887
01:23:02,330 --> 01:23:04,110
uh,
that's not your forte.

1888
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:06,020
I.
But one,

1889
01:23:06,210 --> 01:23:07,043
one thing I wanted to ask both alcorn 
this time I want to shit on instagram 

1890
01:23:14,891 --> 01:23:18,940
and then come back at me with his 
instagram.

1891
01:23:18,941 --> 01:23:21,730
What's up with bottles?
It's amazing.

1892
01:23:22,310 --> 01:23:23,710
He's just like,
he's a,

1893
01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:27,130
he's slow.
He's so into it.

1894
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:28,960
She,
when the guy comes over,

1895
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:29,990
he goes,
you're full of crap.

1896
01:23:29,991 --> 01:23:31,360
You ever went to the money?
Just punches him.

1897
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:32,591
Hey,
check this out.

1898
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:33,730
I wanted to ask you,
what do you.

1899
01:23:33,731 --> 01:23:37,600
What do you think is trump going to do 
anything about the stratospheric aerosol

1900
01:23:37,601 --> 01:23:38,434
injection?
I write that down because we were 

1901
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:46,420
talking about stratospheric aerosol 
injection.

1902
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:48,720
Can't get to the points that you want.
Let me know.

1903
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:50,980
What do you think trump wants to stop 
that.

1904
01:23:50,981 --> 01:23:53,860
I'm going to chuck write it down.
Write that down,

1905
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:55,300
but the next question,
I'll do it here.

1906
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:56,253
That's the question.
The question he just said was five 

1907
01:23:58,510 --> 01:24:01,330
before the Alex Jones is off the rails 
right now,

1908
01:24:03,310 --> 01:24:05,530
but I didn't get the job.
Why don't we have to write it down?

1909
01:24:05,531 --> 01:24:08,720
I didn't get it because you've been bad 
listening.

1910
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:11,583
Will trump.
Is trump going to do anything about 

1911
01:24:13,230 --> 01:24:15,560
that,
that program to stop,

1912
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:18,670
but what do you.
What do you think the program is ending?

1913
01:24:18,850 --> 01:24:22,800
What do you think the program,
the director of the CIA,

1914
01:24:22,801 --> 01:24:25,270
he's talking about it on Youtube.
Look on your job,

1915
01:24:25,980 --> 01:24:26,690
John.
Oh,

1916
01:24:26,690 --> 01:24:28,320
Brenda.
Talk about strategies,

1917
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:30,520
strategies,
solid injections.

1918
01:24:30,521 --> 01:24:31,354
It's going to cost $10,000,000,000
a year and there's going to be some 

1919
01:24:33,641 --> 01:24:34,474
countries opposed to it because it's 
going to mess up the atmospheric 

1920
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:40,210
manipulation and I'm talking about 
stratospheric.

1921
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:42,753
I've never heard of that.
It's super important when you can break 

1922
01:24:44,411 --> 01:24:47,230
it down to three letters yet.
Let's go to John.

1923
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:51,850
Oh,
Brennan admitted last in June of 2016 at

1924
01:24:51,851 --> 01:24:56,380
the video and comment on it.
Can you play a jamie?

1925
01:24:57,110 --> 01:25:00,000
John O'Brien talking about this forever.
I'm not.

1926
01:25:00,010 --> 01:25:02,080
I'm not bashing you,
but you entertaining show my jokes about

1927
01:25:02,081 --> 01:25:03,650
it,
which I get because a lot of it's.

1928
01:25:03,710 --> 01:25:04,543
Yes,
there is an entire atmospheric 

1929
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:08,170
terraforming geoengineering 
manipulation.

1930
01:25:08,171 --> 01:25:11,530
I don't call it chem trails and of 
course the CIA director admitted.

1931
01:25:11,531 --> 01:25:12,364
They have this huge program.
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation owns 

1932
01:25:14,261 --> 01:25:16,810
the major patents on it from 
Westinghouse and others.

1933
01:25:16,811 --> 01:25:19,420
They use these big antennas to 
manipulate the weather.

1934
01:25:19,421 --> 01:25:20,254
They can.
China's like causing huge harp like 

1935
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:25,710
technology.
It's all declassified.

1936
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:28,360
Think heart manipulates the.
Whether they admit it does.

1937
01:25:28,361 --> 01:25:31,210
I used to have the hand of Heart,
general bitten k part.

1938
01:25:31,211 --> 01:25:32,530
Not all the time,
but the.

1939
01:25:32,531 --> 01:25:33,364
Exactly.
There's giant weather modification 

1940
01:25:34,961 --> 01:25:38,230
systems and there's weather wars between
different governments and they.

1941
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:40,440
It's all declasse.
Explain to people that are listening,

1942
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:42,190
what harp is,
what does it stand for?

1943
01:25:42,430 --> 01:25:45,430
High altitude something.
Yeah.

1944
01:25:45,431 --> 01:25:46,264
They've got a system that supposedly you
don't know what really was under 

1945
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:50,080
classification.
What does it stand for?

1946
01:25:50,081 --> 01:25:53,350
High frequency active auroral research 
programs.

1947
01:25:53,351 --> 01:25:54,184
So the idea behind this was they wanted 
to do research on the Aurora and didn't 

1948
01:25:58,121 --> 01:25:58,954
they want to see if they could 
communicate using it and sending radio 

1949
01:26:01,331 --> 01:26:03,680
waves?
Horizon Radar,

1950
01:26:03,770 --> 01:26:04,603
right?

1951
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:05,533
Yeah.
That and they also wanted to be able to 

1952
01:26:07,491 --> 01:26:10,600
send radio signals to places where they 
wouldn't really know.

1953
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:13,550
What does that have to do with 
stratospheric aerosol and just really go

1954
01:26:13,551 --> 01:26:14,840
into the atmosphere.
Well,

1955
01:26:14,841 --> 01:26:19,530
the speculation this.
I've interviewed the private head of it.

1956
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:22,123
Okay.
I'm to let him on my work with the 

1957
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:28,220
hottest harp work with the chem trails.
What do they let me check goes on?

1958
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:29,833
Only A.
my chronic amount of small amount of 

1959
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:32,453
what harp does is in the atmosphere.
It's bouncing off the Aurora borealis 

1960
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:41,210
and then resonating back through in a,
in a deep earth,

1961
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:45,590
a communication program to satellites 
and other things through the planet,

1962
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:49,100
so it's something she can communicate 
with satellites through the satellites,

1963
01:26:49,101 --> 01:26:50,840
down to the submarines.
So here it goes.

1964
01:26:50,841 --> 01:26:53,420
This is an actual business definition.
How harp works.

1965
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:57,170
The facilities transmitters send radio 
waves according to hold on.

1966
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:58,003
Let's just read it.
First waves upwards into the ionosphere 

1967
01:27:00,051 --> 01:27:00,884
between 100 and 350 kilometers altitude.
The resulting heating effect creates 

1968
01:27:04,911 --> 01:27:07,220
irregularities and the electron density 
there,

1969
01:27:07,221 --> 01:27:11,900
which in turn allows communication 
signals as from satellites to be relayed

1970
01:27:12,050 --> 01:27:14,750
off the ionosphere.
That's not what it really does.

1971
01:27:14,990 --> 01:27:15,823
Then they can shoot the shadow light 
frequency coded through the Earth to 

1972
01:27:18,921 --> 01:27:19,760
submarines.
Now,

1973
01:27:19,761 --> 01:27:23,540
what is this website from there?
The Jamie bully.

1974
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:25,670
You want the real stuff?
I'll tell you.

1975
01:27:25,730 --> 01:27:26,563
Yeah,
sure.

1976
01:27:26,730 --> 01:27:29,390
Okay.
Let me explain something.

1977
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:31,000
Okay.
Dot Com.

1978
01:27:31,070 --> 01:27:32,970
I had the head of the heart program on 
just fucking.

1979
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:33,913
I got contacted about 10 years ago and 
they said the head of the Hart project 

1980
01:27:36,681 --> 01:27:39,990
really lecture work.
He liked to come on interviews online.

1981
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:40,853
He liked to come on and tell everybody,
and about 30 minutes in a colonel came 

1982
01:27:42,951 --> 01:27:44,600
on the line and said,
sorry,

1983
01:27:44,601 --> 01:27:47,690
during a break and cut the guy off.

1984
01:27:47,940 --> 01:27:51,380
Well,
I mean this really happened.

1985
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:53,960
Q spooky music cue,
spooky music,

1986
01:27:53,980 --> 01:27:56,300
but I believe you.
That's a true story.

1987
01:27:56,301 --> 01:27:57,134
I want to know.
I want to know that I want another 

1988
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:01,280
relationship between like what are the 
chem trails have to do?

1989
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:02,353
Do you think trump is going to look into
the SIA project at the CIA has green 

1990
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:10,340
lit.
He is starting out with vaccines.

1991
01:28:10,341 --> 01:28:13,010
As I told people he would do 
investigating and all the damage they've

1992
01:28:13,011 --> 01:28:14,570
caused.
The ultimate.

1993
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:17,690
That's good to start the vaccines.
Get that shit together too,

1994
01:28:17,691 --> 01:28:21,560
for sure,
but what about the SAI programs that the

1995
01:28:21,561 --> 01:28:22,394
CIA has greenlit?
You think he's going to get into that 

1996
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:25,590
next level?
Said,

1997
01:28:25,630 --> 01:28:27,200
we want him to communicate with these 
microphones.

1998
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:32,201
Internet shouldn't be like,
you're so locked onto this.

1999
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:35,840
Here's the problem with all this asset 
shit.

2000
01:28:35,930 --> 01:28:36,763
Most of what you see when you see those 
jets flying around those clouds behind 

2001
01:28:40,101 --> 01:28:44,150
them,
most of that is just a fringe in exactly

2002
01:28:44,151 --> 01:28:47,720
the infusers that with a real program.
What's the real progress?

2003
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:48,261
Well,
here's the thing.

2004
01:28:48,261 --> 01:28:49,500
You're right,
and so his job,

2005
01:28:49,501 --> 01:28:52,020
because the world is complex,
there are secret and clauses,

2006
01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:52,863
secret and public programs to test 
manipulation of the weather and weather 

2007
01:28:55,221 --> 01:28:56,870
systems.
The Arabs are doing it,

2008
01:28:56,871 --> 01:28:57,704
the Chinese are doing it.
The Russians are doing people being 

2009
01:28:58,671 --> 01:29:00,930
cloud seeding for a hundred years now

2010
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:03,703
whether manipulation,
but they're doing it for different 

2011
01:29:05,401 --> 01:29:08,830
purposes in that not to produce.
Right.

2012
01:29:08,860 --> 01:29:09,693
I had been living keep going.
The head of the US weather weapon 

2013
01:29:12,601 --> 01:29:16,610
program for 27 years on my show first 
because I saw it was he.

2014
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:18,690
I saw that he was in the panhandle of 
Texas.

2015
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:22,860
I called him running a major cloud 
seeding company with his son and got the

2016
01:29:22,861 --> 01:29:23,694
90 year old to Austin and then after 
that he totally freaked out because the 

2017
01:29:26,221 --> 01:29:29,280
cio came to his house.
Do you want the interviews on Youtube?

2018
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:31,070
Do you want to know what he said?
Yes,

2019
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:36,390
he was a world war two fighter pilot and
I said at the end of World War Two,

2020
01:29:36,391 --> 01:29:40,350
he flew the first planes and hurricanes 
in the Atlantic.

2021
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:41,633
That's pretty gangster and into typhoons
that are even faster in the Pacific and 

2022
01:29:45,961 --> 01:29:46,794
then he and then he also let squadrons 
in Vietnam flooding everything up to 10 

2023
01:29:49,351 --> 01:29:52,260
feet of water out of clear blue skies 
with an hour's work with,

2024
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:55,850
with their,
with their chemicals pass.

2025
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:58,200
You have to be to do that.
It's super bad ass.

2026
01:29:58,230 --> 01:30:01,470
Fly into a hurricane or a typhoon Jesus.
He's the first guy to do it.

2027
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:03,120
Holy Shit.
Anyways,

2028
01:30:03,730 --> 01:30:04,770
he's super bad ass.
I don't know.

2029
01:30:04,771 --> 01:30:06,660
He's alive.
He's been living at 90.

2030
01:30:06,661 --> 01:30:10,230
He was still all there and I thought not
to kicked my ass is big texts and I felt

2031
01:30:10,231 --> 01:30:12,150
like I was.
The guy was with me anyways,

2032
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:13,133
so.
So we're sitting there and he gives me 

2033
01:30:14,851 --> 01:30:15,684
all this data and I can't believe and he
showed me all these classified photos 

2034
01:30:17,551 --> 01:30:19,320
and stuff because they just,
he classified the file.

2035
01:30:19,610 --> 01:30:22,650
No one thought to call the old man from 
Lubbock or whatever it was.

2036
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:23,790
Right?
So I call him,

2037
01:30:23,791 --> 01:30:24,624
I get him on,
they sent a bunch of people that their 

2038
01:30:26,311 --> 01:30:27,144
company and threatened them the next 
week after I heard it and he laid it 

2039
01:30:29,101 --> 01:30:32,970
out.
He said in 1967 when we certified at the

2040
01:30:32,970 --> 01:30:34,740
Stanford Research Institute,
he was able to control hurricanes,

2041
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:36,930
create hurricanes and steer hurricanes.

2042
01:30:37,290 --> 01:30:38,123
All that got black budgeted shut down.
And then they got into these arrays 

2043
01:30:41,581 --> 01:30:43,680
where they could use antennas and out of
that,

2044
01:30:43,681 --> 01:30:45,840
and Westinghouse came,
came the,

2045
01:30:45,841 --> 01:30:46,491
uh,
the,

2046
01:30:46,491 --> 01:30:49,110
the whole heart program show in the 
sixties.

2047
01:30:49,111 --> 01:30:52,170
They could create control and steer or 
kill hurricanes.

2048
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:53,213
That's why you google now.
Bill and Melinda Gates bought all those 

2049
01:30:55,621 --> 01:30:56,454
patents and the quote,
Bill Gates is going to save the world 

2050
01:30:58,681 --> 01:30:59,514
from bad weather.
Bill Gates wants to stop hurricanes 

2051
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:02,110
googling.
So I.

2052
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:05,480
So let me build the weather machine.
Let me pause for a second.

2053
01:31:05,510 --> 01:31:06,343
How does the,
how do,

2054
01:31:06,350 --> 01:31:09,510
how do they manipulate a hurricane?
So the hurricane's going to happen,

2055
01:31:09,511 --> 01:31:11,010
how do they break it up?
Okay.

2056
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:14,940
If it's was coming into lands there,
problem with with Ariel arrays,

2057
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,970
projecting into the sky,
they can break it up or strengthen it or

2058
01:31:17,971 --> 01:31:20,380
kill it or steer it because it's all 
negative.

2059
01:31:20,380 --> 01:31:22,440
I miss doing that with harp will.
They've got.

2060
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:24,210
They've got heart bases all over the 
place.

2061
01:31:24,211 --> 01:31:26,490
They call them doppler radar facilities.
Oh,

2062
01:31:26,550 --> 01:31:27,930
the government.
Once your local city,

2063
01:31:27,931 --> 01:31:28,764
they have doppler radar.
I thought that was so you could have a 

2064
01:31:30,601 --> 01:31:32,460
guy in front of the window.
The script,

2065
01:31:32,461 --> 01:31:34,020
that's it.
Like one 10th of one percent.

2066
01:31:34,021 --> 01:31:37,370
They can crank those arrays up that have
a massive.

2067
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:39,180
Your lights might go when they do it a 
little bit.

2068
01:31:40,170 --> 01:31:41,003
Yeah,
because they'll use the whole power of 

2069
01:31:41,401 --> 01:31:44,670
your town through the doppler radars and
then they control it.

2070
01:31:44,970 --> 01:31:45,803
The US has a giant weather weapon hidden
in front of everybody and every time 

2071
01:31:48,751 --> 01:31:51,960
it's city and poor Russians and Chinese 
are just discovering.

2072
01:31:51,990 --> 01:31:54,540
All the US has weather weapons that can 
knock them all out.

2073
01:31:54,541 --> 01:31:55,950
Right now,
Bill Gate's control,

2074
01:31:55,951 --> 01:32:00,250
the weather ideas for barges to pump 
water from the depth

2075
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:03,400
of the ocean to create some sort of a 
roadblock for the hurricane.

2076
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:06,370
Since her gains pull power from the 
water's warm,

2077
01:32:06,371 --> 01:32:08,980
temperature is cooling,
the water could have theoretically,

2078
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:12,880
theoretically dismantle the hurricane.
Well,

2079
01:32:12,881 --> 01:32:16,140
it sounds like a good idea though.
None of the deployment is loving is it?

2080
01:32:16,150 --> 01:32:21,150
Doesn't that sound like a genius idea?
You spray cold water until the trails.

2081
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:24,670
O'Brien Brennan in the front of the CFR 
is saying,

2082
01:32:24,671 --> 01:32:25,504
we were doing this because for global 
warming and we got to save them about 

2083
01:32:32,110 --> 01:32:33,790
about geoengineering.
Chem trails.

2084
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,490
You were wrong about the dinosaurs.
Not being rude,

2085
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:39,370
but hey,
what about that?

2086
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:40,840
They're.
They're coming out saying,

2087
01:32:40,841 --> 01:32:41,700
hey,
there's gonna.

2088
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:44,650
Be some countries that don't.
That aren't going to be for it.

2089
01:32:44,690 --> 01:32:45,523
We got to figure out how we're going to 
deal with them because you want me to 

2090
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,520
have the audience.
The big cigarette.

2091
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:49,270
Yes.

2092
01:32:49,270 --> 01:32:52,270
Was the big relation.
Keep going with that.

2093
01:32:52,420 --> 01:32:52,931
Come on,
man.

2094
01:32:52,931 --> 01:32:54,400
Don't change the subject.
Keep going with that.

2095
01:32:54,401 --> 01:32:57,430
You're not done with Livingston.
Imagine you're here,

2096
01:32:57,431 --> 01:32:58,610
but imagine that me and Joe were 
actually.

2097
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:00,033
You got me off on.
You want me here about Ronald Reagan to 

2098
01:33:01,870 --> 01:33:06,370
later finish the s a.
He doesn't know about this,

2099
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:10,600
but it's a minor deal.
What do you know about the SSI program?

2100
01:33:10,820 --> 01:33:12,310
Look,
let's get this done.

2101
01:33:12,311 --> 01:33:15,590
When most of the real programs are just 
like fronts for something else,

2102
01:33:15,591 --> 01:33:18,970
it's not even real.
So you don't think they're spraying shit

2103
01:33:18,971 --> 01:33:19,890
into the atmosphere?
No.

2104
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:20,733
There is a program for Geo Engineering.
There's a program in place and you just 

2105
01:33:24,251 --> 01:33:25,084
said it's the doppler radar system and 
harp and what else and an aerial 

2106
01:33:28,601 --> 01:33:30,970
spraying still the most effective and 
what do they do?

2107
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,740
They do have pat.
When you say an aerial spraying,

2108
01:33:32,741 --> 01:33:33,574
what are they spraying?

2109
01:33:34,030 --> 01:33:35,740
Barium salts.
Alumina oxide.

2110
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:36,633
Radioactive isotopes in the air balloon 
was because because it does a bunch of 

2111
01:33:42,551 --> 01:33:43,780
things,
they're testing a bunch of stuff.

2112
01:33:43,781 --> 01:33:45,310
They're they're.
They're manipulating things.

2113
01:33:45,550 --> 01:33:46,460
Listen,
our pedagogy,

2114
01:33:47,150 --> 01:33:47,983
why do you have evidence that they're 
doing this and spraying aluminum and 

2115
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:50,733
Barium,
whatever it is in line and the 

2116
01:33:52,690 --> 01:33:53,523
Department of Energy.
It's all public.

2117
01:33:53,740 --> 01:33:57,400
Just like he just go online and watch 
the Chinese dude get jacked by a tiger.

2118
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:58,333
That's great.
That's how to go to the Department of 

2119
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:04,030
Energy Dot Gov and you can watch cfr.
CIA director at the time,

2120
01:34:04,031 --> 01:34:07,000
Brendan it admitting all this.
This is all public.

2121
01:34:07,001 --> 01:34:08,640
Yeah.
He talked about,

2122
01:34:08,650 --> 01:34:09,610
but he'd know.
I saw it.

2123
01:34:09,611 --> 01:34:10,444
I saw the video.
We could play the video and go over it 

2124
01:34:11,741 --> 01:34:12,574
if you want,
but he's talking about various options 

2125
01:34:13,901 --> 01:34:16,540
for controlling global warming.
They're laying out the future.

2126
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:18,380
Look,
if global warming is a guy.

2127
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:19,870
Hold on,
hold on a second.

2128
01:34:19,871 --> 01:34:22,000
If global warming is real,
we know it is right.

2129
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:23,013
Don't you think they would have?
You don't believe global warming is 

2130
01:34:24,620 --> 01:34:25,453
real.
Keep measuring these temperatures and 

2131
01:34:27,311 --> 01:34:30,660
scientists keep saying,
okay,

2132
01:34:31,630 --> 01:34:35,390
well let's find out.
Let's find out what the real.

2133
01:34:35,470 --> 01:34:37,690
Okay.
I believed that it was high.

2134
01:34:37,691 --> 01:34:38,524
It goes cold.
There's always micro temperature change 

2135
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:41,733
this shift.
She was the only thing that ever 

2136
01:34:42,611 --> 01:34:45,970
happened that's taxes to Al Gore won't 
fix it.

2137
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:48,970
Okay.
I think we all agree that the shifts,

2138
01:34:49,090 --> 01:34:52,300
but what I'm saying is there absolutely 
is global warming,

2139
01:34:52,510 --> 01:34:54,170
right?
What is the CEO?

2140
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:58,010
The second talking house.
When my dad

2141
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:58,843
was a kid,
the 19 fifties for three or four months 

2142
01:35:00,621 --> 01:35:01,454
out of the year,
it was below zero or freezing and you 

2143
01:35:02,990 --> 01:35:06,080
had to chop wood and he'd freeze your 
ass off and all houses had,

2144
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:07,730
even in the south had,
had,

2145
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:10,820
you know,
had all sorts of chimneys and um,

2146
01:35:10,821 --> 01:35:11,654
for fireplaces because it was freezing 
cold and now there has been a warming 

2147
01:35:14,841 --> 01:35:17,660
period,
but that's part of a normal global cycle

2148
01:35:17,661 --> 01:35:20,210
based on the sun.
All these astrophysicist or.

2149
01:35:20,211 --> 01:35:21,044
Sure.
The whole thing about claiming it's the 

2150
01:35:22,221 --> 01:35:25,010
carbon we put out the earth is carbon 
star.

2151
01:35:25,070 --> 01:35:25,903
There's a carbon cycle.
That's the big story I want to get to 

2152
01:35:28,490 --> 01:35:30,830
the globalist.
Want to tax if they can tax oxygen,

2153
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:32,720
carbon dioxide,
water or sunlight,

2154
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:35,320
they have total control over the whole 
life cycle of the planet.

2155
01:35:35,530 --> 01:35:36,830
Well,
let's play the video.

2156
01:35:36,831 --> 01:35:37,930
Let's play the video.
This,

2157
01:35:37,931 --> 01:35:38,764
this CIA guy talking about it because 
what I inferred from and trying to come 

2158
01:35:42,111 --> 01:35:45,560
up with some sort of solutions,
if global warming becomes a giant,

2159
01:35:45,561 --> 01:35:47,210
White Brennan is a fricking known.

2160
01:35:47,210 --> 01:35:48,043
What hobbyist would show Joe?
What is the CIA that's watch the video 

2161
01:35:52,821 --> 01:35:54,920
for global warming?
It's a good question.

2162
01:35:54,921 --> 01:35:56,960
What do they have to do?
I don't know what the CIA does.

2163
01:35:56,970 --> 01:35:57,803
Due Diligence.
They were never built that stop the 

2164
01:36:01,041 --> 01:36:03,530
spread of communism,
but it's an intelligence agency.

2165
01:36:03,531 --> 01:36:04,940
They're part of the environment.
Okay.

2166
01:36:04,941 --> 01:36:07,940
They were a part of the intelligence 
community and if they got hired,

2167
01:36:07,941 --> 01:36:08,774
I would imagine.
This is just me guessing right off the 

2168
01:36:09,801 --> 01:36:13,700
top of my head.
If they got hired to assess a threat and

2169
01:36:13,701 --> 01:36:15,990
a threat being from global warming,
like what?

2170
01:36:15,991 --> 01:36:18,020
What do we have to worry about?
Are we really going to lose cities?

2171
01:36:18,050 --> 01:36:20,270
Do we really have an issue?
Goes Down,

2172
01:36:20,330 --> 01:36:24,980
give George Soros and the UN total power
for a 100 trillion per decade.

2173
01:36:24,981 --> 01:36:28,730
Global tax to micromanaging,
surveil everything humans do.

2174
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:31,380
Let's say is if carbons toxic,
they've got to surveil it.

2175
01:36:31,460 --> 01:36:33,350
Thus they have a jurisdiction to control
our lives.

2176
01:36:33,410 --> 01:36:33,920
Okay.
Hold on.

2177
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:36,830
Why does it say debunked?
CIA director admits chem trails,

2178
01:36:36,831 --> 01:36:39,620
geoengineering,
stratospheric aerosol injections.

2179
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:42,840
Uh,
so it says the claim guys,

2180
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:45,890
hold on,
hold on.

2181
01:36:45,950 --> 01:36:46,783
At the counsel admits geoengineering in 
the form of stratospheric aerosol 

2182
01:36:50,601 --> 01:36:54,240
injections.
Sai is taking a place I eat.

2183
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:55,093
Kempter is taking place it chem trails,
and the rebuttal is nowhere in his 

2184
01:36:57,801 --> 01:36:58,634
speech.
Is there an admission that an sai 

2185
01:37:00,111 --> 01:37:00,944
program has already taken place?
The part where Brendan mentioned 

2186
01:37:03,110 --> 01:37:03,943
geoengineering is just one example.
Out of several not often mentioned 

2187
01:37:07,130 --> 01:37:11,180
issues with the CIA monitors for 
potential elements of instability in the

2188
01:37:11,181 --> 01:37:13,400
world.
A ski program,

2189
01:37:13,401 --> 01:37:14,234
if ever implemented,
could penetrate conflicts and security 

2190
01:37:16,641 --> 01:37:17,474
threats if misused.
The CIA's jobs to consider all types of 

2191
01:37:20,691 --> 01:37:21,524
concepts,
concepts for potential future problems 

2192
01:37:24,201 --> 01:37:27,500
and threats,
including the science oriented concepts.

2193
01:37:27,650 --> 01:37:29,320
That's totally.
Let me break down the right,

2194
01:37:29,340 --> 01:37:30,770
but isn't that possible?
And we're done.

2195
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:33,140
But what that guy just said,
is that possible?

2196
01:37:33,141 --> 01:37:34,760
No.
That's basically what Brendan said,

2197
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:38,240
but what he's saying is that there are 
potential threats.

2198
01:37:38,241 --> 01:37:39,380
He only.
Mentally,

2199
01:37:39,381 --> 01:37:40,400
it's an issue,
right?

2200
01:37:40,401 --> 01:37:42,700
So he's not admitting that he had.
There's an Sar,

2201
01:37:42,730 --> 01:37:43,850
but let me.
Let me tell you.

2202
01:37:43,970 --> 01:37:44,721
Okay,
go ahead.

2203
01:37:44,721 --> 01:37:48,530
Tell me everybody debates how many 
programs there are,

2204
01:37:48,531 --> 01:37:49,960
all the specifics.
A lot of that's classical.

2205
01:37:49,961 --> 01:37:53,110
Fuck.
You can google Shyna launches,

2206
01:37:53,130 --> 01:37:55,240
major weather control operations 10 
years ago,

2207
01:37:55,241 --> 01:37:56,010
right?
Or

2208
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:59,610
Qatar does it,
or Saudi Arabia or UK or for sure people

2209
01:37:59,611 --> 01:38:00,150
have studied.
No,

2210
01:38:00,150 --> 01:38:00,983
no,
no,

2211
01:38:01,050 --> 01:38:02,520
there's.
They call it study.

2212
01:38:02,690 --> 01:38:03,523
There was a giant hell in 2005.
The Department of Energy Program for 

2213
01:38:07,711 --> 01:38:08,544
Aerosol testing was $5 million a year.
So under US Code Title Fifty Chapter 

2214
01:38:12,271 --> 01:38:14,820
Thirty Two subsection 1,528,
paragraph B.

2215
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:16,260
is that true?
You nailed that,

2216
01:38:16,261 --> 01:38:16,740
right?
Yes,

2217
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:18,870
yes.
From under US code.

2218
01:38:19,180 --> 01:38:22,290
Do you live on that obelisk?
That was fucking insane.

2219
01:38:22,291 --> 01:38:23,790
Let me just tell you.
I get into.

2220
01:38:23,791 --> 01:38:28,791
Remember the time last time with Cheetah
fought under us.

2221
01:38:30,241 --> 01:38:33,480
Code title,
Finish Number Thirty 2,528,

2222
01:38:33,481 --> 01:38:34,400
paragraph B.
that's.

2223
01:38:35,170 --> 01:38:36,460
That's insane.
Under that,

2224
01:38:36,510 --> 01:38:38,400
say it's slow that Jamie.
Write it up.

2225
01:38:38,450 --> 01:38:41,230
Jaylin was code title 50 chapter.
I say it fast.

2226
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:45,990
Remember us code title 50 chapters,
Statute Section 1,528,

2227
01:38:45,991 --> 01:38:49,020
paragraph eight,
subsection 128.

2228
01:38:49,050 --> 01:38:53,080
The real fast brand fact speed.
Kenya speech came and say it.

2229
01:38:53,140 --> 01:38:56,780
It's like one thought.
Jesus us code section one.

2230
01:38:56,790 --> 01:39:00,780
There's restrictions on use of human 
subjects for testing of chem trails.

2231
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:01,650
Go,
go back,

2232
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:02,280
go back,
back.

2233
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:04,470
There you go.
Or biological agents,

2234
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:05,333
right now,
what they do in this is they say it's 

2235
01:39:07,291 --> 01:39:09,960
illegal to test unless it's for 
research.

2236
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:13,460
Then you're allowed to kill people.
It was for research purpose.

2237
01:39:13,530 --> 01:39:15,450
You know,
that's how some of those Japanese whaler

2238
01:39:15,451 --> 01:39:17,220
vessels get away with killing whales.
Still.

2239
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:18,653
They say it's for research purposes and 
they kill the whales and seldom dark 

2240
01:39:21,511 --> 01:39:22,650
shit.
The elites,

2241
01:39:23,020 --> 01:39:25,980
the elites are the mad scientist 
engineers.

2242
01:39:26,130 --> 01:39:26,963
I'm gonna.
Give you the big secret man if you want 

2243
01:39:27,910 --> 01:39:29,940
to do.
I'm not kidding around.

2244
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:30,803
I know I'm not eating.
The thing is they call their the high 

2245
01:39:33,031 --> 01:39:34,350
priests.
They're scientists,

2246
01:39:34,650 --> 01:39:37,440
they're engineers.
They're allowed to kill people.

2247
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:40,710
Test stuff on kids and jet black people 
with syphilis,

2248
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:44,370
all the declassified stuff because they 
are scientists.

2249
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:45,233
All the real executioners tortures or 
most of them were people making 

2250
01:39:48,661 --> 01:39:49,494
decisions are doctors and so it's all 
medical doctor stuff in this big 

2251
01:39:52,921 --> 01:39:55,290
breakaway civilization of scientist.
Okay?

2252
01:39:55,291 --> 01:39:57,200
And so that's what they've built and 
under,

2253
01:39:57,530 --> 01:40:01,620
under under researched provisions,
they could even kill anybody.

2254
01:40:01,621 --> 01:40:02,251
They want.
All right,

2255
01:40:02,251 --> 01:40:05,250
I'm going to go back because we took 
Eddie turn on chem trails,

2256
01:40:05,251 --> 01:40:06,084
but we did it to side track from what 
you were saying about the moon and I 

2257
01:40:08,341 --> 01:40:09,174
want to go back to what you're saying 
because you were saying that there was 

2258
01:40:10,711 --> 01:40:11,544
two completely different missions and 
one of them was real and that there was 

2259
01:40:14,671 --> 01:40:17,690
some sort of contact with aliens.
No,

2260
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:19,910
I was getting to that or I'm saying I 
had a top.

2261
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:21,110
Is that what you were implying?
Taught?

2262
01:40:21,310 --> 01:40:22,160
Well,
well,

2263
01:40:22,170 --> 01:40:23,790
let's just say this.
It's mind blowing.

2264
01:40:24,210 --> 01:40:25,043
I was told by a top NASA individual,
Raymond Tig that indeed there was a 

2265
01:40:28,651 --> 01:40:29,484
breakaway program and that he heard and 
saw transmissions on some back channels 

2266
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:35,633
of real feeds and advanced ships that 
he'd never even seen that basically 

2267
01:40:39,991 --> 01:40:40,824
didn't even look like they were anything
that he could imagine that was 

2268
01:40:42,331 --> 01:40:43,164
classified and he knew about some 
classified programs for every program 

2269
01:40:46,201 --> 01:40:47,880
you saw,
there was at least 10 programs that were

2270
01:40:47,881 --> 01:40:48,210
sacred.

2271
01:40:48,210 --> 01:40:50,460
That's a bit about NASA.
Ninety percent sacred or more,

2272
01:40:50,910 --> 01:40:52,830
and so he knew about a cloud,
a bunch classified programs,

2273
01:40:52,831 --> 01:40:53,664
and he was shaking

2274
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:54,933
transmissions and things coming back and
talk to people about a whole breakaway 

2275
01:40:58,001 --> 01:40:59,590
program they sent.
That was a lot safer,

2276
01:40:59,591 --> 01:41:00,424
a lot bigger than the moon.
Then they had guys up in orbit just 

2277
01:41:03,221 --> 01:41:07,150
basically so that even other foreign 
governments from the trajectory point,

2278
01:41:07,151 --> 01:41:08,980
we think they were getting transmissions
back from the moon.

2279
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:11,980
So they had people out basically out 
outside of the regular orbit.

2280
01:41:11,981 --> 01:41:12,814
We just go around in circles or is it 
geosynchronous where you're in one spot 

2281
01:41:15,610 --> 01:41:16,443
transmitting back from mathematical spot
to look like transmissions to full 

2282
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:21,610
directions and everybody,
all the real mission was going on,

2283
01:41:21,870 --> 01:41:23,020
uh,
on the moon.

2284
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:27,970
So you believe they went to the moon,
do you think that it was buzz Aldrin and

2285
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:30,570
Neil Armstrong,
clickonomy everything.

2286
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:32,830
He died.
He said,

2287
01:41:32,831 --> 01:41:35,050
I'm going to meet with you tomorrow.
And he done too.

2288
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:38,100
That's like a movie.
He told me I'm ready.

2289
01:41:38,110 --> 01:41:41,290
I'm going to tell you everything.
And then he was just totally,

2290
01:41:41,291 --> 01:41:43,300
it was crazy.
But he did admit to you that,

2291
01:41:43,670 --> 01:41:45,850
uh,
what the public got was fake.

2292
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:48,020
Yeah.
He,

2293
01:41:48,150 --> 01:41:49,530
he couldn't get into it.
Well,

2294
01:41:49,540 --> 01:41:53,740
there's some footage from the moon that 
looks so ridiculous and most people have

2295
01:41:53,741 --> 01:41:57,250
never seen some footage of them that.
Here's,

2296
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:58,113
here's the big speculation.
This is one of the really big ones was 

2297
01:42:00,330 --> 01:42:01,163
that there was a lot of footage that 
they did where they were doing tests 

2298
01:42:04,450 --> 01:42:07,420
that they wound up just using for press 
releases.

2299
01:42:07,421 --> 01:42:08,254
They using like to say this is actual 
footage on the right stuff for the 

2300
01:42:12,341 --> 01:42:14,380
project because they wanted to be 
guaranteed of it,

2301
01:42:14,950 --> 01:42:15,783
the real truth.
But there was a thing with Michael 

2302
01:42:18,220 --> 01:42:19,300
Collins,
Gemini Fifteen,

2303
01:42:19,330 --> 01:42:20,163
there was a test photo of him with like 
a test rig on and it was like suspended 

2304
01:42:25,151 --> 01:42:26,770
and you can see the background behind 
him.

2305
01:42:26,770 --> 01:42:30,610
It was clear that he was suspended on 
wires and they took that same photo in,

2306
01:42:30,611 --> 01:42:35,320
blacked it out and used it as a press 
photo of him on an actual space walk.

2307
01:42:35,620 --> 01:42:38,230
But it's the same exact photo stuff.
Yeah.

2308
01:42:38,231 --> 01:42:40,400
They do that where they just go over it 
with it back then.

2309
01:42:40,401 --> 01:42:41,990
And you see you actually use an exact 
domain.

2310
01:42:42,050 --> 01:42:43,000
Here's the thing,
my dad,

2311
01:42:43,001 --> 01:42:44,640
when he was just like a junior in high 
school,

2312
01:42:44,660 --> 01:42:45,493
was in the plan to program at ut and 
they already had cd roms and computers 

2313
01:42:49,390 --> 01:42:52,480
and they had a nuclear,
a plant under,

2314
01:42:52,481 --> 01:42:53,314
but nobody knew about it.
My Dad going about this when I was a 

2315
01:42:55,211 --> 01:42:57,650
teenager and I would like later go to 
the library,

2316
01:42:57,680 --> 01:42:59,380
couldn't find it,
and then I googled it.

2317
01:42:59,381 --> 01:43:00,214
It's not even really in the news,
but I've gone to ut and talked to them 

2318
01:43:02,441 --> 01:43:02,951
and I go,
yeah,

2319
01:43:02,951 --> 01:43:06,310
you know about the reactor,
the building reactor that Austin's got.

2320
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:07,253
And then no one even knew that Austin 
has two nuclear reactors in North 

2321
01:43:10,380 --> 01:43:11,213
Austin.
What?

2322
01:43:11,770 --> 01:43:12,670
Yeah.
But the poem was my.

2323
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:14,410
That was for you.
That was after he was in college.

2324
01:43:14,411 --> 01:43:17,320
They built a reactor under which 
building in Austin,

2325
01:43:17,321 --> 01:43:19,150
Texas.
It's big.

2326
01:43:19,151 --> 01:43:20,820
It's a big railway system under there,
but it's,

2327
01:43:20,821 --> 01:43:23,830
it's built right under,
right under,

2328
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:25,090
like I said,
gesture.

2329
01:43:25,660 --> 01:43:28,840
So there's a nuclear reactor in Austin,
Texas.

2330
01:43:28,990 --> 01:43:31,650
How many people know about this?
You know,

2331
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:34,210
it's in the literature and my dad told 
me about it when I was a kid.

2332
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:35,370
I thought,
I mean,

2333
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:36,213
I believe my dad,
my dad told me about Dallas hospital 

2334
01:43:38,201 --> 01:43:41,200
that was killing people for their organs
for like six years later.

2335
01:43:41,201 --> 01:43:42,780
I saw it on 60 minutes.
Why?

2336
01:43:43,540 --> 01:43:46,030
They were killing people for organs.
Really.

2337
01:43:46,210 --> 01:43:49,690
My Dad told me about that in Dallas,
Texas on 60 minutes.

2338
01:43:50,260 --> 01:43:52,040
Yeah.
My Dad said when I was 16 years

2339
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:53,660
ago or 15 taken driver's course,
she said,

2340
01:43:53,870 --> 01:43:56,360
don't sign that organ donor card.
I know hospitals that kill you.

2341
01:43:56,690 --> 01:43:57,530
Jesus.
And I said,

2342
01:43:57,531 --> 01:43:58,081
dad,
you're kidding.

2343
01:43:58,081 --> 01:43:58,914
He goes,
no.

2344
01:43:59,140 --> 01:43:59,973
He was an oral surgeon and rewired jaws 
because I've heard this one killed 

2345
01:44:01,471 --> 01:44:03,950
people all the time.
Is one of the creepiest things you ever.

2346
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:07,910
Can you imagine doctors that get 
kickbacks for Oregon's.

2347
01:44:07,911 --> 01:44:11,360
They kind of let the see stars are seen 
as the highest caste,

2348
01:44:11,361 --> 01:44:12,194
but the elite,
so they're the ones pulling all the 

2349
01:44:13,410 --> 01:44:14,241
stuff.
I'm telling you,

2350
01:44:14,241 --> 01:44:15,074
man,
you know how creepy it would be like to 

2351
01:44:16,490 --> 01:44:19,100
find out that a nurse that you were 
working with was killing people,

2352
01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:23,450
but that's a story that happens over and
over until the crazy smart killer.

2353
01:44:23,460 --> 01:44:25,490
There's been a bunch they get.
They get.

2354
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:25,810
No,
no,

2355
01:44:25,810 --> 01:44:26,171
no,
no,

2356
01:44:26,171 --> 01:44:27,004
no,
no,

2357
01:44:27,110 --> 01:44:29,930
no.
These nurses that say nurses decide they

2358
01:44:29,931 --> 01:44:31,790
don't want to take care of somebody and 
they poisoned them.

2359
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:32,833
They.
They have someone that maybe someone's 

2360
01:44:33,771 --> 01:44:34,604
dying slow and they don't like it and 
they just get tired of dealing with 

2361
01:44:37,101 --> 01:44:39,560
their bullshit some of the time.
The district.

2362
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:40,850
Oh yeah.
A lot of the times,

2363
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:41,693
their sadistic.
There's been a lot worse than I have 

2364
01:44:43,461 --> 01:44:44,990
about facts.
You're absolutely on target.

2365
01:44:45,270 --> 01:44:48,220
You don't.
It's no worse than everything.

2366
01:44:49,140 --> 01:44:52,430
Everything I know and you're on target.
You just pretend you're not.

2367
01:44:52,990 --> 01:44:56,540
No one just knew that document off the 
top of your head like that.

2368
01:44:56,541 --> 01:44:57,374
So rain man.
I must have been obsessed with chem 

2369
01:44:59,631 --> 01:45:00,710
trails,
right?

2370
01:45:01,180 --> 01:45:03,010
No.
I know a bunch of other.

2371
01:45:03,550 --> 01:45:08,240
He's got a crazy mind.
Had a photographic memory.

2372
01:45:08,241 --> 01:45:10,760
Tell us about 35 and now it's not good 
anymore.

2373
01:45:11,220 --> 01:45:13,100
Steals that from me,
stuff I remember,

2374
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:14,473
but I,
I want to tell you guys the big 

2375
01:45:15,381 --> 01:45:16,430
enchilada.
Please.

2376
01:45:16,431 --> 01:45:17,870
The Big Enchilada.
Wear these headphones.

2377
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:18,561
No.
Well,

2378
01:45:18,561 --> 01:45:20,120
the problem is when we don't have 
headphones on,

2379
01:45:20,121 --> 01:45:21,020
we talk over each other.

2380
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:23,600
It's hard when three people are talking,
you know,

2381
01:45:23,610 --> 01:45:24,411
it's just,
you know,

2382
01:45:24,411 --> 01:45:26,260
it's none of our fault.
It's just natural.

2383
01:45:26,270 --> 01:45:27,190
The conspiracy.
You,

2384
01:45:27,191 --> 01:45:28,610
you're,
you are Bill Hicks,

2385
01:45:28,790 --> 01:45:29,623
Huh?
No,

2386
01:45:29,860 --> 01:45:31,980
I'm younger than him.
Totally different.

2387
01:45:32,220 --> 01:45:35,080
I love how I haven't had any success.
It's all Bill Hicks.

2388
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:37,010
He was a funny guy,
but give me a fricking break,

2389
01:45:37,011 --> 01:45:37,844
man.
Listen to those families call me before 

2390
01:45:39,771 --> 01:45:40,604
and said,
please stop the people saying your Bill 

2391
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:44,420
Hicks and all these damn people.
Don't worry about that.

2392
01:45:44,421 --> 01:45:45,380
Put the headphones back on.
Sorry.

2393
01:45:45,450 --> 01:45:48,810
We have to be fine.
So I need to know.

2394
01:45:49,030 --> 01:45:52,400
I need to know what do you know about 
aliens and how much are aliens?

2395
01:45:52,401 --> 01:45:53,234
Real.
Alright,

2396
01:45:53,250 --> 01:45:54,980
let.
This is really big.

2397
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:56,700
So.
Okay.

2398
01:45:58,470 --> 01:46:00,890
Put another shot of that media at the 
south property.

2399
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:03,860
The question is,
what does Donald Trump know about?

2400
01:46:04,130 --> 01:46:04,671
Oh yeah,
it was.

2401
01:46:04,671 --> 01:46:05,390
He know now,
right?

2402
01:46:05,390 --> 01:46:09,470
Because he's in the office.
That would be the first thing.

2403
01:46:09,471 --> 01:46:11,540
I think that Joe Rogen experience 
deserves it.

2404
01:46:11,541 --> 01:46:15,200
That's the first thing I did.
I would run to the office and I'd go,

2405
01:46:15,201 --> 01:46:18,140
who's got the documents?
Who's got the alien documents?

2406
01:46:18,230 --> 01:46:19,490
Who's got them?
Who's got them?

2407
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:21,470
That would be the first thing I would 
want to know.

2408
01:46:21,471 --> 01:46:22,700
Right.
Cheers sir.

2409
01:46:23,290 --> 01:46:26,660
Boring Shit.
I got to piss too.

2410
01:46:26,950 --> 01:46:29,030
You're a robot.
You never have to piss 'em.

2411
01:46:29,670 --> 01:46:31,280
Alright.
Let me give you my best please.

2412
01:46:31,610 --> 01:46:34,220
Deep research approximation once.
What do you think is going?

2413
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:36,430
But it.
Am I wrong to his.

2414
01:46:36,450 --> 01:46:38,870
Still hold out.
Hope that aliens are real because I tell

2415
01:46:38,871 --> 01:46:39,704
you has one.
The two guilty pleasures that I still 

2416
01:46:41,781 --> 01:46:45,340
cling to his big foot and aliens.
Those are two big foot.

2417
01:46:45,350 --> 01:46:47,030
Not so much.
I wish it was real,

2418
01:46:47,031 --> 01:46:48,950
but I just don't.
Yes.

2419
01:46:49,220 --> 01:46:50,053
Big Wood Trim.

2420
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:51,630
No.
Come on Daddy.

2421
01:46:51,930 --> 01:46:53,160
No.
Are you ready?

2422
01:46:54,050 --> 01:46:54,781
Yes.
I'm gonna.

2423
01:46:54,781 --> 01:46:55,890
Give you the big enchilada.
Joe.

2424
01:46:55,891 --> 01:46:58,230
There are aliens in this room right now 
for real?

2425
01:46:58,350 --> 01:46:59,370
Yeah.
You're not of this world,

2426
01:46:59,371 --> 01:47:00,060
Bro.
Me,

2427
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:01,770
you're the alien.
Oh Wow.

2428
01:47:01,771 --> 01:47:03,060
I didn't know.
It's like,

2429
01:47:03,061 --> 01:47:03,894
um,
there was like an old comic book about 

2430
01:47:05,161 --> 01:47:05,994
that,
about some dude who was a forgetful 

2431
01:47:08,401 --> 01:47:09,234
professor and then he realized at the 
end of it he was actually an alien from 

2432
01:47:11,671 --> 01:47:14,100
another planet that's sent down here to 
monitor people.

2433
01:47:14,101 --> 01:47:16,320
He just forgot,
well,

2434
01:47:16,321 --> 01:47:18,750
here's what the elite belief,
and let me be very clear as to what.

2435
01:47:18,751 --> 01:47:21,330
He'll tell you some context.
I only go with what I can prove.

2436
01:47:21,390 --> 01:47:22,060
Oh,
thank you.

2437
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:23,790
And people can't even handle that.
Okay.

2438
01:47:23,820 --> 01:47:24,653
Well,
I'm really surprised how much you knew 

2439
01:47:25,171 --> 01:47:28,140
every angle of so called pizza gate that
I even forgot.

2440
01:47:28,141 --> 01:47:29,550
Well,
it's to meet.

2441
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:31,860
Well,
obviously we both have children and when

2442
01:47:31,861 --> 01:47:34,500
you hear about someone that wants to 
molest children,

2443
01:47:35,940 --> 01:47:39,450
it's a special kind of evil to special 
and it's.

2444
01:47:39,450 --> 01:47:40,283
And it's also a special kind of bizarre,
twisted sickness that the human mind is 

2445
01:47:45,660 --> 01:47:50,400
capable of latching onto the programming
to want to take care of kids and be nice

2446
01:47:50,401 --> 01:47:51,234
to them.
There's something very crazy about 

2447
01:47:53,460 --> 01:47:54,293
people's brains and there's something 
very crazy about the weird variables 

2448
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:02,010
that can potentially happen.
I agree with all sorts of weird,

2449
01:48:02,011 --> 01:48:05,130
crazy aberrations in standard behavior.
You know like this,

2450
01:48:05,131 --> 01:48:07,830
the standard behavior of bunch of people
that are just normal folks.

2451
01:48:07,831 --> 01:48:09,060
You got kids.
I got kids.

2452
01:48:09,061 --> 01:48:10,500
Oh,
get the kids together for a play date.

2453
01:48:10,501 --> 01:48:11,940
You sit down and you have a couple of 
beers.

2454
01:48:11,941 --> 01:48:12,774
You laugh.
You Joe,

2455
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:14,040
have a good night.
Bob Guyton.

2456
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:15,960
Steve.
That's fucking normal shit right?

2457
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,450
When you're normal and there's normal 
people around you,

2458
01:48:18,451 --> 01:48:20,850
you assume that everybody is basically a
good person.

2459
01:48:20,851 --> 01:48:21,684
We all have our problems.
Normal that your wife comes into the 

2460
01:48:24,181 --> 01:48:24,870
bedroom.

2461
01:48:24,870 --> 01:48:26,130
She,
you get going.

2462
01:48:26,131 --> 01:48:28,410
You don't look at a five year old and 
think that's what I want.

2463
01:48:28,430 --> 01:48:29,263
No,
there's some were trying to say is 

2464
01:48:30,691 --> 01:48:34,320
there's some people out there that have 
this horrific programming.

2465
01:48:34,321 --> 01:48:35,154
Whatever the fuck it is that causes it 
as a bunch of psychologists trying to 

2466
01:48:37,831 --> 01:48:38,664
speculate and figure out what causes to 
be beat in the head with a ball pin 

2467
01:48:41,101 --> 01:48:43,220
hammer.
The thing is it's real and it's.

2468
01:48:43,221 --> 01:48:44,680
It's terrifying.
Candida.

2469
01:48:44,710 --> 01:48:45,543
It's going on.
We can't deny it's real and it's also 

2470
01:48:47,150 --> 01:48:50,190
like fucking jared from subway,
the subway guy,

2471
01:48:50,340 --> 01:48:54,750
the subway guys in jail for being a 
pedophile and they fuck they came up and

2472
01:48:54,751 --> 01:48:58,140
they usually have high intelligence and 
there's armies were fighting a pedophile

2473
01:48:58,141 --> 01:48:58,974
conspiracy,
but beyond that it's a vampire 

2474
01:49:00,481 --> 01:49:01,314
conspiracy and that they are 
interdimensionally sucking the essence 

2475
01:49:04,891 --> 01:49:08,940
of our youth and they believe they're 
possessed by an off world entity.

2476
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,560
They do.
Yeah.

2477
01:49:10,561 --> 01:49:12,510
And Joe,
I've been on air 22 years.

2478
01:49:12,511 --> 01:49:15,240
I don't get into aliens,
metaphysical religion,

2479
01:49:15,241 --> 01:49:16,074
any of that.
I've studied the elite and I've also 

2480
01:49:17,860 --> 01:49:19,330
communicated with a lot of the top 
people and,

2481
01:49:19,331 --> 01:49:20,610
and,
and if you want to know,

2482
01:49:20,910 --> 01:49:24,240
I will actually break down right now the
best knowledge right now.

2483
01:49:24,241 --> 01:49:25,980
What's happening on the planet,
what's happening?

2484
01:49:27,660 --> 01:49:29,050
Let me give you a basic.
Just sculpt.

2485
01:49:29,220 --> 01:49:30,053
Okay?
I love when you can use that word with 

2486
01:49:31,171 --> 01:49:33,360
full confidence.
I've never said that.

2487
01:49:33,361 --> 01:49:35,880
Let me give you a basic gestalt.
I'd be like,

2488
01:49:35,881 --> 01:49:37,170
oh my God,
it's such a fraud.

2489
01:49:37,590 --> 01:49:38,161
No,
you're not,

2490
01:49:38,161 --> 01:49:38,994
you know,
but that's what I would think if I use 

2491
01:49:39,571 --> 01:49:41,220
that word now you'll get all this shit 
you already have.

2492
01:49:41,221 --> 01:49:44,670
Most of the static is you're a bookworm 
or research warm and a good way.

2493
01:49:46,050 --> 01:49:48,100
The elite are all about transcendence

2494
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:48,933
and living forever and the secrets of 
the universe and they want to know all 

2495
01:49:51,140 --> 01:49:51,881
this.
Some are good,

2496
01:49:51,881 --> 01:49:53,200
some are bad,
some are a mix,

2497
01:49:53,890 --> 01:49:54,723
but the good ones don't ever want to 
organize the battles and want to 

2498
01:49:57,191 --> 01:49:58,024
organize because they lost after power.
Powerful consciousness don't want to 

2499
01:50:01,391 --> 01:50:02,224
dominate other people.
They want to empower them so they don't 

2500
01:50:03,671 --> 01:50:06,490
tend to get together until things are 
really late in the game.

2501
01:50:06,491 --> 01:50:09,100
Then they come together.
Evils always defeated because good is so

2502
01:50:09,101 --> 01:50:13,360
much stronger and we're on this planet 
and Einstein's physics shut at.

2503
01:50:13,361 --> 01:50:14,700
Max Planck says,
shut her off.

2504
01:50:14,701 --> 01:50:15,534
There's at least 12 dimensions and now 
that's all the top scientists and 

2505
01:50:18,071 --> 01:50:20,500
billionaires are coming out saying it's 
a false hologram.

2506
01:50:20,501 --> 01:50:21,334
It is artificial.
The computers are scanning and and 

2507
01:50:23,711 --> 01:50:24,544
finding tension points where it's 
artificially projected and gravity's 

2508
01:50:28,061 --> 01:50:31,580
bleeding in to this universe.
That's what they call it.

2509
01:50:31,580 --> 01:50:32,413
Dark matter,
so we're like a thought or a dream 

2510
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:38,620
that's a whisk in some computer program,
some God's mind,

2511
01:50:38,621 --> 01:50:41,950
whatever they're approving it all.
It's all coming out now.

2512
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:43,233
There's like this sub transmission zone 
below the third dimension that's just 

2513
01:50:46,751 --> 01:50:47,584
turned over.
The most horrible things is what it 

2514
01:50:48,371 --> 01:50:51,760
resonates to and it's trying to get up 
into the third dimension.

2515
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:52,833
That's just a basic level consciousness 
to launch into the next levels and our 

2516
01:50:56,831 --> 01:50:59,200
species is already way up at the fifth,
sixth dimension,

2517
01:50:59,210 --> 01:51:00,043
consciously our best people,
but there's this big war trying to like 

2518
01:51:03,071 --> 01:51:03,904
basically destroy humanity because 
humanity has free will and there's a 

2519
01:51:07,241 --> 01:51:09,670
decision to which level we want to go 
to.

2520
01:51:09,671 --> 01:51:10,504
We have freewill,
so evil is allowed to come and content 

2521
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:17,280
not just good and the athletes 
themselves believe they're racing.

2522
01:51:18,660 --> 01:51:19,493
We using human technology to try to take
our best minds and build some type of 

2523
01:51:23,441 --> 01:51:26,980
breakaway civilization where they're 
going to merge with machines,

2524
01:51:26,981 --> 01:51:30,010
transcend and breakaway from the failed 
species.

2525
01:51:30,010 --> 01:51:30,843
That is man,
which is kind of like a false 

2526
01:51:31,961 --> 01:51:34,750
transmission because they're thinking 
what they are is ugly and bad.

2527
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:37,550
Projecting it onto themselves instead of
believing notes,

2528
01:51:37,570 --> 01:51:42,400
a human test about building us up,
and so google was set up 18,

2529
01:51:42,401 --> 01:51:43,480
19 years ago.
This was.

2530
01:51:43,481 --> 01:51:44,860
I knew about this before it was 
declassified.

2531
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:45,753
I'm just saying I've good sources that 
they wanted to build a giant artificial 

2532
01:51:48,761 --> 01:51:49,594
system and Google believes that the 
first artificial intelligence will be a 

2533
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:54,553
super computer based on the neuron 
activities of the hive mind of humanity 

2534
01:51:59,740 --> 01:52:00,573
with billions of people wired into it 
with the Internet of things and so all 

2535
01:52:03,461 --> 01:52:04,294
of our thoughts go into it and we're 
actually building a computer that has 

2536
01:52:06,671 --> 01:52:07,504
real neurons in real time that's also 
psychically connected to us that are 

2537
01:52:11,141 --> 01:52:16,141
organic creatures so that they will have
current prediction powers,

2538
01:52:16,510 --> 01:52:19,000
future prediction powers a true crystal 
ball.

2539
01:52:19,810 --> 01:52:23,260
But the big secret is once you have a 
crystal ball and know the future,

2540
01:52:23,380 --> 01:52:27,700
you can add stimuli beforehand and make 
decisions that control the future.

2541
01:52:27,850 --> 01:52:28,683
And so then it's the end of 
consciousness and free will for 

2542
01:52:30,941 --> 01:52:34,120
individuals as we know.
And a true two point,

2543
01:52:34,121 --> 01:52:35,320
oh,
in a very bad way.

2544
01:52:35,410 --> 01:52:36,243
Hive mind consciousness with an ai 
jacked into everyone knowing our hopes 

2545
01:52:39,641 --> 01:52:41,530
and dreams,
delivering it to us,

2546
01:52:41,531 --> 01:52:42,364
not in some pkd wire head system where 
we plug in and give up on consciousness 

2547
01:52:45,950 --> 01:52:48,590
because of unlimited pleasure,
but because we were already wired in and

2548
01:52:48,591 --> 01:52:49,424
absorbed before we knew it,
by giving over our consciousness to the 

2549
01:52:52,071 --> 01:52:52,904
system,
our daily decisions that it was able to 

2550
01:52:54,351 --> 01:52:56,660
manipulate and control into a larger 
system.

2551
01:52:56,900 --> 01:52:57,733
There's now a human counterstrike taking
place to shut this off before it gets 

2552
01:53:01,071 --> 01:53:01,904
fully into place and to block these 
systems and to try to have an actual 

2553
01:53:04,761 --> 01:53:05,594
debate about where humanity goes and cut
off the pedophiles and psychic vampires 

2554
01:53:09,650 --> 01:53:12,980
that are control of this ai system 
before humanity is destroyed.

2555
01:53:13,010 --> 01:53:15,200
Wait a minute,
is only controlled of Ai.

2556
01:53:15,410 --> 01:53:17,920
How'd they get had the pedophiles 
getting control of the pet,

2557
01:53:17,921 --> 01:53:19,180
the pedophiles at,
uh,

2558
01:53:19,250 --> 01:53:21,770
at whatever level rule the devil,
whatever you want to call it.

2559
01:53:21,771 --> 01:53:24,770
This interdimensional thing that gives 
them advanced offworld technology.

2560
01:53:24,771 --> 01:53:25,604
The fallen one that's not of this world 
is giving them advanced systems have 

2561
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:33,500
been used before on other populations.
What that Satan.

2562
01:53:33,650 --> 01:53:34,483
But what are you talking about?
Let's say explain that you just see 

2563
01:53:37,300 --> 01:53:38,133
something,
something that you know the stupid 

2564
01:53:39,740 --> 01:53:40,573
preacher tells you about who's totally 
controlled or something you read about 

2565
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:45,040
in the news or TV,
right?

2566
01:53:45,050 --> 01:53:49,700
This is an interdimensional force that 
wants to influence us to build something

2567
01:53:49,850 --> 01:53:53,150
that absorbs us and kills us rather than
the divine.

2568
01:53:53,470 --> 01:53:54,303
A freewill we're given to build 
something much better than empowers the 

2569
01:53:57,620 --> 01:53:58,453
species.
So the species is now making a decision 

2570
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:01,970
on its entire future.

2571
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,370
When you're getting this from,
from that,

2572
01:54:03,371 --> 01:54:04,940
that's what it is.
But where are you getting it?

2573
01:54:04,950 --> 01:54:07,370
I know from,
from looking at all the data,

2574
01:54:07,371 --> 01:54:09,980
researching and studying it,
watching the enemy,

2575
01:54:10,130 --> 01:54:13,340
that's the big decision that humanity 
has now got before us.

2576
01:54:13,490 --> 01:54:17,270
So if you were directing someone to 
investigate this on their own,

2577
01:54:17,450 --> 01:54:20,190
how would they do that?
So if you say,

2578
01:54:20,220 --> 01:54:21,680
here's the problem,
you get someplace.

2579
01:54:21,710 --> 01:54:25,700
Finally in deep research where it's what
every culture already said,

2580
01:54:25,701 --> 01:54:27,170
what everybody already knew,
what they're telling you.

2581
01:54:27,171 --> 01:54:28,004
A movies like promethium,
what the elite admit the New York Times 

2582
01:54:30,621 --> 01:54:31,990
they believe in is this,
you know,

2583
01:54:32,330 --> 01:54:35,240
a seated by offworld systems.
Panspermia,

2584
01:54:35,270 --> 01:54:36,260
yes.
Everything,

2585
01:54:36,261 --> 01:54:37,094
everything.
They're doing points towards this and 

2586
01:54:38,691 --> 01:54:41,810
then you read their own writings.
They believe we're this ugly,

2587
01:54:41,811 --> 01:54:43,730
fallen,
ugly species.

2588
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:44,593
We're all going to be killed there.
The rich billionaires who are better 

2589
01:54:47,031 --> 01:54:47,864
than us and they're going to merge with 
machines and become gods and go to the 

2590
01:54:50,181 --> 01:54:50,690
next level.

2591
01:54:50,690 --> 01:54:51,523
Don't you think that most people who 
extrapolate from where we stand today 

2592
01:54:54,411 --> 01:54:55,244
with our cell phones and our apple 
watches and our integration with the 

2593
01:54:57,681 --> 01:54:58,514
computer and the Internet constantly,
don't you think that most people see 

2594
01:55:01,550 --> 01:55:03,980
that there's going to be some sort of 
symbiotic connection?

2595
01:55:04,190 --> 01:55:06,350
It's a very easy thing.
They were saying it before.

2596
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:08,090
I understand,
but a lot of people were saying,

2597
01:55:08,110 --> 01:55:10,760
but here's a problem.
Who engineered what we were given?

2598
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,190
What is the point of the back door at 
the Trojan horses?

2599
01:55:13,191 --> 01:55:14,024
Hey,
here's what I'm Jenny who engineered 

2600
01:55:14,910 --> 01:55:15,700
what?
Here's what.

2601
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:18,080
Here's what I'm telling you.
The elite,

2602
01:55:18,470 --> 01:55:21,410
the elite literally believe 
interdimensionally.

2603
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:24,800
They were given this information and 
then built it and here's the thing.

2604
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:25,813
They built it and Google admits he would
have data dumps to wire two years ago 

2605
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:31,513
that they're building an ai that will in
human consciousness freewill and take 

2606
01:55:34,691 --> 01:55:37,010
over and the next species will rise out 
of that.

2607
01:55:37,220 --> 01:55:39,680
They've already decided.
Our species people have been taught.

2608
01:55:39,681 --> 01:55:43,380
Marshall Mcluhan was talking about that 
50 fucking ago.

2609
01:55:43,381 --> 01:55:44,010
Here's the old.
They

2610
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:44,843
built it Amazon two years ago at mets.
They can already with 99 percent 

2611
01:55:48,511 --> 01:55:51,270
certainty pick what their regular users 
are going to order.

2612
01:55:51,300 --> 01:55:52,800
Alex,
before they hold on a second,

2613
01:55:52,801 --> 01:55:56,160
ready instead of dragging this out to 
some nefarious end,

2614
01:55:56,190 --> 01:55:58,660
isn't it entirely possible that all 
these futurists,

2615
01:55:58,670 --> 01:55:59,503
all these technological innovators,
they all see the same end game if 

2616
01:56:03,331 --> 01:56:06,870
there's going to be some sort of a 
complete integration between people,

2617
01:56:06,871 --> 01:56:07,704
but it's the artificial intelligence 
that historically everybody saw this 

2618
01:56:10,921 --> 01:56:11,670
coming,
right,

2619
01:56:11,670 --> 01:56:13,350
and so this big,
all the futurists,

2620
01:56:13,351 --> 01:56:14,184
all the people that started in the 
future before a silicon chips were 

2621
01:56:17,101 --> 01:56:19,410
created.
The point Marshall Mcluhan,

2622
01:56:19,411 --> 01:56:20,244
I think it was in the 1970 said that 
human beings are the sex organs of the 

2623
01:56:23,611 --> 01:56:24,444
machine world,
and he was saying even back then that 

2624
01:56:27,451 --> 01:56:28,284
human beings are eventually going to 
integrate or become something that's a 

2625
01:56:32,471 --> 01:56:33,304
part of telling you is there's a 
centralized system of what they're 

2626
01:56:36,541 --> 01:56:38,360
building that isn't naturally occurs.

2627
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:41,410
Who is that?
Where artificial he was doing the elitch

2628
01:56:41,411 --> 01:56:44,040
believe they're getting off world 
building.

2629
01:56:44,041 --> 01:56:45,660
These things that you're just describing
right now.

2630
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:46,673
I mean if you actually read with all the
global is say you've obviously read 

2631
01:56:48,291 --> 01:56:49,410
their writings,
you know this show,

2632
01:56:49,710 --> 01:56:50,543
they are getting knocked off world,
but interdimensional communications to 

2633
01:56:55,230 --> 01:56:58,710
build this system that we see lowers our
ICU,

2634
01:56:58,740 --> 01:57:00,830
makes us live less.
I've never asked is okay,

2635
01:57:00,850 --> 01:57:02,890
but when you're making these big 
statements,

2636
01:57:02,900 --> 01:57:03,733
they've getting into dimensional signals
is telling them to create these systems 

2637
01:57:06,750 --> 01:57:07,583
that lower iqs.
That's something you got to really 

2638
01:57:09,451 --> 01:57:10,970
prove.
Like if there's.

2639
01:57:11,970 --> 01:57:12,631
Okay,
please.

2640
01:57:12,631 --> 01:57:16,170
If there's something you can show all 
the studies show screen time,

2641
01:57:16,171 --> 01:57:20,360
all the computers,
lowering our as lowing fertility must be

2642
01:57:20,440 --> 01:57:21,780
right there.
Was that a case?

2643
01:57:21,810 --> 01:57:24,840
Is that a case of a somebody's holding a
gun to your head?

2644
01:57:24,841 --> 01:57:25,710
Let me tell you about me.

2645
01:57:25,980 --> 01:57:29,550
I'm addicted to this God damn thing.
I love watching videos.

2646
01:57:29,690 --> 01:57:31,770
I love.
I love taking pictures and shit.

2647
01:57:31,950 --> 01:57:32,783
I love looking at humanity.
There's a lot of beautiful things he 

2648
01:57:35,461 --> 01:57:36,480
does,
but I'll tell you,

2649
01:57:36,510 --> 01:57:38,610
they're very addictive.
Very addictive.

2650
01:57:38,700 --> 01:57:39,690
So.
But hold on a second.

2651
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:40,553
Let me stop you right there.
I don't necessarily think that's 

2652
01:57:42,571 --> 01:57:43,404
engineered to be addictive.
I think it's engineered to be really 

2653
01:57:45,151 --> 01:57:45,984
well and the fact work really well and 
the fact that it works really well is 

2654
01:57:48,511 --> 01:57:51,120
very addictive.
Just like little kids look at a screen,

2655
01:57:51,270 --> 01:57:52,103
you put a fucking television in front of
them when they're one year old and play 

2656
01:57:54,411 --> 01:57:56,550
some stupid commercial and they're like,
whoa,

2657
01:57:56,551 --> 01:57:58,530
Joe.
They picked a second.

2658
01:57:58,540 --> 01:57:59,760
No,
they don't.

2659
01:57:59,890 --> 01:58:01,350
They made a better.
Hold on a second.

2660
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:04,350
They made better and better technology 
that we're not designed to absorb.

2661
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:06,310
Human beings have exactly set through.

2662
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:10,470
At the moment we have the exact same DNA
that we did 10,000

2663
01:58:10,471 --> 01:58:13,140
years of the Atlantic when there was 
nothing like television.

2664
01:58:13,141 --> 01:58:16,230
There was nothing like movies,
there was nothing like stereo headphones

2665
01:58:16,231 --> 01:58:18,800
and project,
but don't go on.

2666
01:58:18,810 --> 01:58:22,250
You're crazy when you're interrupted.
My crazy rant.

2667
01:58:22,520 --> 01:58:23,353
I am telling you that this is a natural 
progression of this massive infatuation 

2668
01:58:27,511 --> 01:58:29,730
that we have with technology.
They don't have to engineer it.

2669
01:58:29,850 --> 01:58:31,590
It's natural.
It happens to you.

2670
01:58:31,591 --> 01:58:32,424
It happens to me.
Happens to anybody who's looking at 

2671
01:58:34,411 --> 01:58:36,630
cooler and cooler.
Special effects in movies.

2672
01:58:36,930 --> 01:58:37,763
All that stuff is a natural.
Steve Jobs wouldn't let his kids play 

2673
01:58:39,901 --> 01:58:42,030
with an ipad.
Well then he's a cunt.

2674
01:58:42,820 --> 01:58:44,090
He's a cunt.
Let your kids play with.

2675
01:58:45,440 --> 01:58:47,090
Fuck's wrong.
That right ran.

2676
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:49,510
I'm not disagreeing with you.
Interrupted it 10 times.

2677
01:58:49,511 --> 01:58:50,241
You fuck.
Oh,

2678
01:58:50,241 --> 01:58:52,060
I'm to let a motherfucker rant.
Rant,

2679
01:58:52,310 --> 01:58:52,841
rant,
rant.

2680
01:58:52,841 --> 01:58:54,220
Then I'm done.
Now.

2681
01:58:54,340 --> 01:58:57,260
Shit,
they're going to get back to this.

2682
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:59,200
We're not talking about the weather.
It can tell you that right now.

2683
01:58:59,201 --> 01:59:01,350
Let me tell you right now.
Let me tell you right now.

2684
01:59:02,140 --> 01:59:02,740
Fuck.
Cloud.

2685
01:59:02,740 --> 01:59:05,670
Let me tell you.
I'm trying to break this down.

2686
01:59:05,960 --> 01:59:08,530
The whole thing is being set up to 
control.

2687
01:59:08,590 --> 01:59:10,270
Okay?
What I'm telling you when you're talking

2688
01:59:10,271 --> 01:59:12,670
about the elites and interdimensional 
signals that they're receiving,

2689
01:59:12,671 --> 01:59:15,310
they're telling us to lower Iq.
You can't just say that.

2690
01:59:15,350 --> 01:59:16,420
Need proof.
Okay.

2691
01:59:16,421 --> 01:59:19,440
Let me give you a proof.
That sounds so crazy by the way,

2692
01:59:19,460 --> 01:59:20,580
Miriam.
Yeah.

2693
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:21,910
Oh,
that sounds so crazy.

2694
01:59:21,911 --> 01:59:23,590
I wonder where the aliens was.
They honor.

2695
01:59:23,650 --> 01:59:24,483
You know what?
It's really cool to say the computer 

2696
01:59:26,650 --> 01:59:28,660
simulation,
but it talks about that.

2697
01:59:28,661 --> 01:59:33,570
Everyone says no,
but they're saying that will be easily,

2698
01:59:33,860 --> 01:59:35,070
easily pitch.
Oh yeah,

2699
01:59:35,110 --> 01:59:35,943
we're in a computer simulation,
but then when you talk about 

2700
01:59:37,490 --> 01:59:41,510
interdimensional like magical shit,
like,

2701
01:59:41,650 --> 01:59:42,670
wait a minute.
Exactly.

2702
01:59:42,820 --> 01:59:45,130
Magic is a technology that hasn't been 
discovered yet.

2703
01:59:45,190 --> 01:59:47,680
Exactly,
and that's what these videos are fucking

2704
01:59:47,681 --> 01:59:52,270
magic for you and we.
You and I could do this right now and we

2705
01:59:52,271 --> 01:59:53,710
could go like here.
We'll do it right now.

2706
01:59:53,720 --> 01:59:56,410
This is what's what we're going to do.
We're going to go right now.

2707
01:59:56,420 --> 01:59:59,230
You want to talk some magic because this
really is fucking magic.

2708
01:59:59,470 --> 02:00:04,470
We're going to do instagram live right 
now.

2709
02:00:04,841 --> 02:00:05,674
We're not instagram live.
We're doing like one of those little 

2710
02:00:07,331 --> 02:00:12,331
instagram stories is a whole new,
a whole new thing.

2711
02:00:12,910 --> 02:00:13,890
Young Jamie,
am I right?

2712
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:14,913
Fuck.

2713
02:00:15,400 --> 02:00:18,370
This isn't live yet.
Oh,

2714
02:00:18,410 --> 02:00:19,540
occasionally I did,
but I.

2715
02:00:19,780 --> 02:00:23,960
You go a little longer than you.
Let me go on.

2716
02:00:24,430 --> 02:00:29,010
What's that?
We're going to go to Alex.

2717
02:00:29,011 --> 02:00:33,490
got to piss again.
Go past all these lightweights.

2718
02:00:33,710 --> 02:00:37,830
I'm just drinking coffee.
I drank one of these kill cliff coffees.

2719
02:00:38,190 --> 02:00:43,190
I drank one order of a butter coffee.
I'm drinking this Erewhon conspiracy.

2720
02:00:44,791 --> 02:00:46,810
It's a conspiracy.
I'm drinking some juice.

2721
02:00:47,110 --> 02:00:49,450
I had two glasses of whiskey.
That's bullshit.

2722
02:00:49,510 --> 02:00:51,470
And these bitches are.
They keep pen.

2723
02:00:51,590 --> 02:00:56,590
I don't understand it.
Hold your little girl something.

2724
02:00:56,890 --> 02:01:01,150
I take a credit to break that.
That was was his rant.

2725
02:01:01,330 --> 02:01:02,920
I'm not sure.
We're going to go back to that.

2726
02:01:03,110 --> 02:01:04,370
He's definitely high as fuck,
dude.

2727
02:01:04,410 --> 02:01:08,260
This stuff about children's telling him 
some fucking.

2728
02:01:08,350 --> 02:01:09,760
Exactly.
Crazy shit.

2729
02:01:10,110 --> 02:01:11,620
I'm like,
oh my God.

2730
02:01:11,621 --> 02:01:14,110
I'm too fucked up.
You fucked up.

2731
02:01:14,290 --> 02:01:16,960
I told you we were going to get.
Yeah,

2732
02:01:18,790 --> 02:01:19,623
I knew that was the key.
The key to make this podcast super 

2733
02:01:21,671 --> 02:01:22,990
special was.
Well He.

2734
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:25,690
He asked for the whiskey himself,
so he started the park.

2735
02:01:25,730 --> 02:01:26,990
Yours or his?
That's his.

2736
02:01:27,070 --> 02:01:27,690
Oh,
that's ours.

2737
02:01:27,690 --> 02:01:28,151
No,
that's ours.

2738
02:01:28,151 --> 02:01:29,190
That's a gentlemen.
Gentlemen,

2739
02:01:29,230 --> 02:01:32,570
live listeners,
this gentleman to record big time.

2740
02:01:32,680 --> 02:01:35,140
Record record.
Holy Shit.

2741
02:01:35,170 --> 02:01:36,590
Gentleman.
Jack is a.

2742
02:01:36,620 --> 02:01:38,020
This is what they sent us.
This right?

2743
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:40,640
It's good.
I mean good and it all tastes terrible.

2744
02:01:41,070 --> 02:01:42,190
It's like,
you know,

2745
02:01:42,290 --> 02:01:43,800
you're sucking on the devil's asshole.

2746
02:01:47,110 --> 02:01:47,943
I mean,
that's kind of half the fun of Whiskey 

2747
02:01:49,161 --> 02:01:54,161
is that it's disgusting.
It to taste good on instagram.

2748
02:01:55,400 --> 02:01:57,940
I love this.
A lot of people thought that this was a,

2749
02:01:57,950 --> 02:01:58,783
a,
a conspiracy because Eddie went live on 

2750
02:02:00,531 --> 02:02:01,364
instagram live and you disappeared.
So there was a lot of talk online ever 

2751
02:02:03,861 --> 02:02:08,861
existed to bill Hicks.
The globalist are anti human.

2752
02:02:10,881 --> 02:02:12,260
They think we're a bunch of dumb 
animals,

2753
02:02:12,261 --> 02:02:14,110
but where are the aliens?
They're carrying on a shot.

2754
02:02:14,150 --> 02:02:19,150
They believe it's not aliens.
Does that have to do with the Luciferian

2755
02:02:19,521 --> 02:02:21,440
freemasonry type shit?
I'd love to.

2756
02:02:21,620 --> 02:02:23,090
Bones,
skull and bunk.

2757
02:02:23,120 --> 02:02:27,770
Breakdown free because I know in the 
Albert Pike wrote the Freemason Bible.

2758
02:02:27,860 --> 02:02:29,900
He's talking about Luciferian Shit.
So if you're free,

2759
02:02:29,901 --> 02:02:34,850
mason proceeding in my hand says he 
talks about he founded the KKK.

2760
02:02:36,850 --> 02:02:38,010
Go for it.
Go for it.

2761
02:02:38,090 --> 02:02:39,690
Tell me about Albert Albert Pike.
No,

2762
02:02:39,730 --> 02:02:40,370
I want to give.

2763
02:02:40,370 --> 02:02:41,030
I mean,
Joe,

2764
02:02:41,030 --> 02:02:41,760
here's the thing.
Joe,

2765
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:42,501
you,
you brought in,

2766
02:02:42,501 --> 02:02:44,990
right to your point about I willing to 
miss it.

2767
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,570
It'll lead to your point because the 
point you brought up,

2768
02:02:47,571 --> 02:02:48,920
the whole issue,
this first place,

2769
02:02:49,490 --> 02:02:51,260
you brought up the whole point about no 
more weed.

2770
02:02:51,261 --> 02:02:56,261
Alex,
taking quotes from Buzz Aldrin tells you

2771
02:02:58,641 --> 02:03:02,230
you went to,
went to smoke.

2772
02:03:02,280 --> 02:03:04,310
He take.
What's the difference?

2773
02:03:04,311 --> 02:03:08,440
I'm not trying to dominate to this guy.
He was a nice.

2774
02:03:08,750 --> 02:03:10,060
Seriously.
I want to be nice.

2775
02:03:10,940 --> 02:03:12,110
Great Guy.
Look,

2776
02:03:12,111 --> 02:03:14,120
I love you man.
I'm happy to see you.

2777
02:03:14,150 --> 02:03:17,540
But I'm telling you this is that the 
globalist admit a lot of this.

2778
02:03:17,541 --> 02:03:18,374
It's in a lot of their white papers.
All of the reports come in to actually 

2779
02:03:19,911 --> 02:03:20,744
give it to you.
I will.

2780
02:03:21,140 --> 02:03:21,973
They.
They say they believe they're going to 

2781
02:03:23,181 --> 02:03:24,014
become gods.
The rest of us are profane and shit 

2782
02:03:25,941 --> 02:03:27,260
about interdimensional beings.

2783
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:30,860
Given them all the data.
Let me tell you,

2784
02:03:30,890 --> 02:03:35,780
you know where the theory of of the 
species,

2785
02:03:36,230 --> 02:03:41,230
and we're all the Darwin stuff came from
where he had an elucidation and believes

2786
02:03:41,331 --> 02:03:42,164
he was given all this stuff from like 
demons and I'm not saying that's really 

2787
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:46,340
confusing.
Darwin Descartes.

2788
02:03:46,490 --> 02:03:46,890
No,
no,

2789
02:03:46,890 --> 02:03:48,250
that's.
Donald didn't take hard.

2790
02:03:48,260 --> 02:03:49,093
Have it,
isn't he the one that came up with the 

2791
02:03:50,061 --> 02:03:50,894
idea of science science from a dream.
So Darwin's idea came from Darwin was 

2792
02:03:53,881 --> 02:03:55,790
like really into watch handling and 
stuff.

2793
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:56,520
Yes.
Yes.

2794
02:03:56,520 --> 02:03:58,670
And the guy said he acts like he does 
it.

2795
02:03:58,671 --> 02:04:00,860
Okay.
Whatever was the guy that.

2796
02:04:00,861 --> 02:04:01,790
Yeah,
a lot of those guys,

2797
02:04:02,260 --> 02:04:03,093
they get the technology,
they believe from a fricken other 

2798
02:04:05,720 --> 02:04:07,370
dementia,
you know,

2799
02:04:07,460 --> 02:04:12,140
people know all about this as much as I 
do or more joe.

2800
02:04:12,290 --> 02:04:14,150
And you sit there and act like you don't
know.

2801
02:04:14,210 --> 02:04:16,580
I forgot you're afraid to give your 
audience all the information,

2802
02:04:16,920 --> 02:04:20,880
but you're saying you're saying Joe 
Barnes,

2803
02:04:21,570 --> 02:04:25,940
but I bring it up making it up to the 
center dimensional.

2804
02:04:26,210 --> 02:04:27,620
But I just wanted to know where it's 
coming.

2805
02:04:28,170 --> 02:04:32,280
Definitely the smartest guy showed it,
showed it Darwin,

2806
02:04:33,160 --> 02:04:35,480
you know,
pulling it up.

2807
02:04:35,481 --> 02:04:37,710
You probably already know that.
I know that Darwin's partner,

2808
02:04:37,711 --> 02:04:38,050
the God

2809
02:04:38,050 --> 02:04:39,840
that he developed a theory of evolution 
where they were,

2810
02:04:39,841 --> 02:04:40,674
they both had like a similar theory and 
they came together with it and he was 

2811
02:04:43,051 --> 02:04:43,884
like really into it to the point where 
he was into channeling and all sorts of 

2812
02:04:46,411 --> 02:04:48,450
weird stuff that knows this discredited 
him.

2813
02:04:48,451 --> 02:04:51,330
I listened to it on radio.
That's what they believe.

2814
02:04:51,331 --> 02:04:53,880
I'm not saying it's real.
Shannon's going to have me up here.

2815
02:04:53,881 --> 02:04:55,260
I'll clipped it out and that's what I'm 
saying.

2816
02:04:55,261 --> 02:04:58,950
I'm saying they discredited him and they
just put all the emphasis on Darwin.

2817
02:04:58,951 --> 02:05:00,880
That's why you only hear about Darwin's 
forward.

2818
02:05:00,890 --> 02:05:03,200
Okay.
From Free Mason level,

2819
02:05:03,300 --> 02:05:06,060
that's phase two.
Let me tell you,

2820
02:05:06,540 --> 02:05:07,890
give up the aliens.
Come on.

2821
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:08,753
I know.
You know things got to go back to you 

2822
02:05:09,810 --> 02:05:11,480
guys.
What do we do?

2823
02:05:11,630 --> 02:05:13,290
You've got to start there,
which is fucking right.

2824
02:05:13,291 --> 02:05:15,150
You don't have to do a show like this.
It's great.

2825
02:05:15,151 --> 02:05:16,020
I love it.
I'm not mad.

2826
02:05:16,440 --> 02:05:17,520
Let me just tell you.
Please do.

2827
02:05:20,850 --> 02:05:22,860
If you look at this,
that's what I'm telling you.

2828
02:05:22,861 --> 02:05:24,320
I don't believe it.
Okay.

2829
02:05:24,390 --> 02:05:26,250
I'm telling you.
She studied with the establishment,

2830
02:05:26,251 --> 02:05:27,084
believes none of them are atheist.
They all believe they're getting 

2831
02:05:29,071 --> 02:05:29,851
interdimensional stuff.
She,

2832
02:05:29,851 --> 02:05:34,140
if you go back to Dalton and Wedgewood 
and Huxley,

2833
02:05:34,300 --> 02:05:35,730
recognize all,
always moderate names.

2834
02:05:36,030 --> 02:05:38,910
If you go back to Darwin,
Darwin wrote this,

2835
02:05:38,911 --> 02:05:39,710
these letters,
republic.

2836
02:05:39,710 --> 02:05:42,030
You can read these online from a 
national,

2837
02:05:42,060 --> 02:05:43,680
you know royal archives in England and 
stuff.

2838
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:48,810
They all believed they were all part of 
a secret breeding program with a British

2839
02:05:48,811 --> 02:05:50,810
thought.
They would have like this super human if

2840
02:05:50,820 --> 02:05:54,180
they bred these six families together to
like create all this,

2841
02:05:54,181 --> 02:05:55,014
just like mainland in British history.
This is just known all eugenics history 

2842
02:05:57,840 --> 02:06:02,840
and then Golten who's related to all 
these other guys in the 18 fifties.

2843
02:06:03,620 --> 02:06:04,453
He starts having these ideas and he says
there's a double helix which the snakes 

2844
02:06:07,321 --> 02:06:08,154
for for science and medicine,
and he said we're going to discover the 

2845
02:06:12,001 --> 02:06:12,834
keys and the building blocks of life,
and he said it's going to be called 

2846
02:06:14,461 --> 02:06:15,294
biometrics and we'll track everybody by 
reading their genetics is what Hitler 

2847
02:06:19,141 --> 02:06:19,974
freaked out about and picked up and 
something like eight of the 14 new 

2848
02:06:25,171 --> 02:06:26,004
sciences like half or more than half the
sciences that came since the 18 sixties 

2849
02:06:29,851 --> 02:06:32,910
were all from Dalton and all from 
Darwin.

2850
02:06:32,910 --> 02:06:34,860
So the media and the liberals give me 
this one thing,

2851
02:06:35,320 --> 02:06:38,160
the origin of the species,
like I'm not saying it's wrong or right.

2852
02:06:38,190 --> 02:06:40,530
It's super heavy.
Like galactic stuff.

2853
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:43,860
They give this to you.
This is only one little boil down.

2854
02:06:43,880 --> 02:06:46,770
BSN We'd have.
You go to what these guys really wrote.

2855
02:06:46,771 --> 02:06:47,604
They were like inter marrying and 
involved in wicked seances and 

2856
02:06:50,760 --> 02:06:52,400
channeling and,
and,

2857
02:06:52,410 --> 02:06:54,180
and,
and all this weird ass crap.

2858
02:06:54,330 --> 02:06:55,530
And then they envision,
okay,

2859
02:06:55,531 --> 02:06:57,000
there's a double helix DNA discovered 
it.

2860
02:06:57,150 --> 02:06:58,020
Okay.
Biometrics,

2861
02:06:58,021 --> 02:06:59,670
okay.
World government computers,

2862
02:06:59,730 --> 02:07:02,280
okay.
Atomic weapons give me the equations and

2863
02:07:02,281 --> 02:07:03,114
they were like all them,
like going to other scientists meetings 

2864
02:07:05,191 --> 02:07:06,024
and go,
we believe there is a program where you 

2865
02:07:07,290 --> 02:07:08,123
take different matter together in 
isotopes and it'll cause an explosion 

2866
02:07:10,770 --> 02:07:11,603
and it's like they were like given 
either humans or super advanced already 

2867
02:07:14,821 --> 02:07:19,080
had this knowledge from somewhere else 
in our genetics and were here before and

2868
02:07:19,081 --> 02:07:19,914
we're able to then manifest this through
genetic memories and archives or it was 

2869
02:07:22,711 --> 02:07:23,544
given off world,
but humans like have all this data 

2870
02:07:25,561 --> 02:07:26,394
compacted and compress ready like 
programs that called like the acacia 

2871
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:32,160
records or something like that as though
all of it is,

2872
02:07:32,220 --> 02:07:33,690
is,
is uh,

2873
02:07:33,720 --> 02:07:35,070
Kaushik epic.

2874
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:37,330
Here's the deal.
Epigenetics.

2875
02:07:37,390 --> 02:07:38,223
They'll take chickens with eggs and do 
10 generations and major universities 

2876
02:07:42,281 --> 02:07:44,380
that have never seen a hot.
And they put them in these,

2877
02:07:44,381 --> 02:07:46,780
like these 20 foot ceilings and they'll 
have a triangle.

2878
02:07:46,781 --> 02:07:48,730
Fly over in a square,
fall over in a little baby.

2879
02:07:48,731 --> 02:07:49,564
Chickens,
neighborcare generation regeneration 

2880
02:07:50,571 --> 02:07:51,404
generation go on for 15 years.
They fly one hawk over and they all 

2881
02:07:54,851 --> 02:07:55,720
squat,
yelling,

2882
02:07:55,721 --> 02:07:57,100
screaming,
and run into their nest.

2883
02:07:57,980 --> 02:07:58,813
Now they never saw hawk and never saw 
kill a chicken generation after 

2884
02:08:01,151 --> 02:08:01,984
generation whiskey.
It was compressed data knowledge of the 

2885
02:08:04,661 --> 02:08:07,630
Hawk that is passed on genetically.
Yeah.

2886
02:08:07,631 --> 02:08:08,464
They say that's why children are always 
afraid of monsters that goes down the 

2887
02:08:10,901 --> 02:08:12,820
Tigers and bears.
I used to be cat.

2888
02:08:12,850 --> 02:08:17,850
My son just wants to be chased so much.
He wants to practice getting away from a

2889
02:08:17,921 --> 02:08:19,810
predator.
He loves that Demos.

2890
02:08:19,990 --> 02:08:21,310
He wants to get away.

2891
02:08:21,310 --> 02:08:26,310
You can't catch me and it'll just be 
ready to fight predators.

2892
02:08:27,311 --> 02:08:28,144
You can't fight.
If you can get the fuck away from that 

2893
02:08:29,411 --> 02:08:31,770
tiger at the Zoo and China,
I recommend you do that.

2894
02:08:31,900 --> 02:08:35,830
Yeah.
My son's good stuff.

2895
02:08:35,980 --> 02:08:36,813
Not even.
You probably wouldn't be saying 

2896
02:08:38,580 --> 02:08:41,360
Alexander one cloth.
You might not even get second.

2897
02:08:41,780 --> 02:08:42,880
I'll.
I'll admit that.

2898
02:08:42,881 --> 02:08:44,140
I was like,
Oh shit.

2899
02:08:44,350 --> 02:08:47,470
We shouldn't have let them smoke weed,
but then now you're thinking.

2900
02:08:47,530 --> 02:08:49,150
Brought it back down.
You came back.

2901
02:08:49,180 --> 02:08:52,540
You came back here and keep it going.
You're going in a good place right now.

2902
02:08:53,020 --> 02:08:53,853
Keep it going.

2903
02:08:54,690 --> 02:08:57,810
You're talking about a.
Now you're getting into Albert Pike.

2904
02:08:58,010 --> 02:09:00,750
Ooh,
well he's the founder of the KKK.

2905
02:09:00,751 --> 02:09:01,584
Kept chomping confederate general head 
of the Illuminati worldwide at that 

2906
02:09:03,661 --> 02:09:06,600
time,
so let's establish something that's like

2907
02:09:06,630 --> 02:09:08,460
maybe people that are listening to this 
might go,

2908
02:09:08,461 --> 02:09:10,250
what in the fuck are these guys ramble 
about?

2909
02:09:10,290 --> 02:09:13,590
Well,
I'm exposed to establish this throughout

2910
02:09:13,591 --> 02:09:14,424
history from the beginning of organized 
human secret knowledge folks don't want 

2911
02:09:17,911 --> 02:09:18,744
to pass on as your own.
There's also been people conspiring to 

2912
02:09:21,331 --> 02:09:23,460
control whatever.
It's the sign.

2913
02:09:23,461 --> 02:09:26,370
What end people conspiring to control 
whatever aspect of it,

2914
02:09:26,371 --> 02:09:29,010
whether it's political,
whether it's the military,

2915
02:09:29,011 --> 02:09:30,930
like whatever it is.
There's always been that.

2916
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:33,120
It's always happened,
has been military coups.

2917
02:09:33,390 --> 02:09:36,990
All throughout history.
There's been wars all throughout and had

2918
02:09:37,130 --> 02:09:39,710
a peaceful and bro.
How so?

2919
02:09:40,130 --> 02:09:40,980
I mean,
dude,

2920
02:09:41,280 --> 02:09:43,850
the intelligence community leaked all 
the data to break down the globalist.

2921
02:09:43,990 --> 02:09:44,823
He Eddie's asking the intelligence 
community leaked all what data they 

2922
02:09:47,761 --> 02:09:48,600
looked all the way he likes.

2923
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:50,520
He's over here saying,
wait a minute.

2924
02:09:50,770 --> 02:09:52,680
Are you saying that the Russians didn't 
do it?

2925
02:09:52,740 --> 02:09:53,760
No.
Really,

2926
02:09:53,940 --> 02:09:56,080
how do you know this?
Because the mainstream media says,

2927
02:09:56,250 --> 02:09:57,083
hold on,
hold on,

2928
02:09:57,090 --> 02:09:58,270
Joe.
Give me a break to.

2929
02:09:58,320 --> 02:09:58,750
No,
no,

2930
02:09:58,750 --> 02:09:59,910
no.
I just want to know how,

2931
02:09:59,911 --> 02:10:00,840
you know,
if you've ever,

2932
02:10:00,890 --> 02:10:02,820
if you've known me for like 16,
17 years.

2933
02:10:03,240 --> 02:10:04,073
Yes.
Do you ever known me to say I have a 

2934
02:10:04,531 --> 02:10:05,730
source that I'm making it up?
Be Honest.

2935
02:10:05,790 --> 02:10:06,700
No,
no,

2936
02:10:06,750 --> 02:10:07,583
no.
I mean I've got sources so you can't 

2937
02:10:08,851 --> 02:10:09,960
tell us how,
you know.

2938
02:10:09,961 --> 02:10:14,961
Let's just say I got data today from a 
head of state and what did he say?

2939
02:10:15,750 --> 02:10:16,630
I can't tell you.
Okay.

2940
02:10:16,650 --> 02:10:19,340
Don't tell me the point is you didn't 
tell me.

2941
02:10:20,180 --> 02:10:21,013
Yeah,
but the frame is we screwed it up and 

2942
02:10:22,741 --> 02:10:24,210
released it early so it caused a 
problem.

2943
02:10:24,211 --> 02:10:27,100
Explain the whole Russian diversion.
We didn't mean on purpose.

2944
02:10:27,150 --> 02:10:27,983
So I'm always mad at us.
Bust out with that one thing because 

2945
02:10:30,961 --> 02:10:33,050
there's intelligent people like my 
students,

2946
02:10:33,110 --> 02:10:33,943
like you hear that

2947
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:35,180
you don't believe the Russians.

2948
02:10:35,400 --> 02:10:38,910
So where should it come from?
How do they believe that?

2949
02:10:38,911 --> 02:10:39,930
Yeah.
Why are you saying that?

2950
02:10:39,931 --> 02:10:44,931
The intelligence agency leaked all this 
and not Russia because I was told before

2951
02:10:46,681 --> 02:10:51,210
it was all leaked by the former director
of psychological operations,

2952
02:10:51,250 --> 02:10:52,410
the CIA.
I was going to come out.

2953
02:10:53,940 --> 02:10:55,320
He told you that it was going to be 
leaked.

2954
02:10:55,560 --> 02:10:56,393
Yeah.
Before I was never like embed with the 

2955
02:10:58,111 --> 02:10:59,940
CIA.
I've interviewed people from the CIA,

2956
02:10:59,941 --> 02:11:01,260
NSA,
defense,

2957
02:11:01,261 --> 02:11:02,160
intelligence,
you name it.

2958
02:11:02,161 --> 02:11:03,930
Over the years.
I mean it's all over the news,

2959
02:11:04,080 --> 02:11:06,240
but it's entirely possible.
General Flynn,

2960
02:11:06,270 --> 02:11:08,040
former head of defense intelligence,
tweets.

2961
02:11:08,041 --> 02:11:10,470
All my articles.
I'm not telling you it's some secret.

2962
02:11:10,471 --> 02:11:12,500
I mean the enemy knows.
The point is,

2963
02:11:12,501 --> 02:11:15,330
is that I'm seen as an honest good 
person and understand what's going on.

2964
02:11:15,331 --> 02:11:17,730
I'm out for humanity.
I don't want personal power.

2965
02:11:17,731 --> 02:11:20,700
I want to help people,
but it isn't an entirely possible.

2966
02:11:20,700 --> 02:11:21,533
I mean like how,
how does the information like that get 

2967
02:11:22,771 --> 02:11:24,420
out?
Well,

2968
02:11:24,421 --> 02:11:25,254
there's an open rebellion against the 
criminals have hijacked our government 

2969
02:11:27,990 --> 02:11:28,823
and so we overthrew the globalist and 
Obama and we're taking him over in 

2970
02:11:32,821 --> 02:11:34,680
France,
in Italy,

2971
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:36,750
in Spain,
in Greece,

2972
02:11:36,751 --> 02:11:37,584
in the UK.
The only place we're not successful so 

2973
02:11:39,061 --> 02:11:39,894
far is Canada.
So you just took Australia about took 

2974
02:11:41,761 --> 02:11:43,920
Australia with the idea of free.
I'm going to sign it.

2975
02:11:43,950 --> 02:11:44,910
What does that mean?
See,

2976
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:46,380
most people sit there and brag about 
stuff.

2977
02:11:46,381 --> 02:11:49,110
I'm telling you what's really going on,
what does it mean for Australia,

2978
02:11:50,310 --> 02:11:51,143
I mean globalist or losing countries 
every month right now to the liberty 

2979
02:11:54,661 --> 02:11:55,200
movement.
What?

2980
02:11:55,200 --> 02:11:56,033
What says that these are people that 
want you and your family to be 

2981
02:11:59,251 --> 02:12:02,670
successful and aren't out to hurt you,
to make you poor like the globalist.

2982
02:12:02,910 --> 02:12:03,743
There's good people and they used the 
intelligence agencies to defeat the 

2983
02:12:07,141 --> 02:12:07,974
globalist and there's been a major 
counter offensive and the globals made 

2984
02:12:10,861 --> 02:12:11,730
one wrong move.

2985
02:12:12,390 --> 02:12:14,100
It happened five years ago.
It was.

2986
02:12:14,130 --> 02:12:16,620
It was system wide leak.
Four years ago.

2987
02:12:16,621 --> 02:12:17,454
I've had CIA whistleblowers.
All Obama show kernels and special 

2988
02:12:20,971 --> 02:12:22,020
operations,
you name it,

2989
02:12:22,350 --> 02:12:25,050
who were authorized by high level 
senators come on my show.

2990
02:12:25,590 --> 02:12:28,440
They ran a counter coup.
There was a deal made with radical Islam

2991
02:12:28,441 --> 02:12:29,274
to actually take over Europe and then 
the United States and by that make us 

2992
02:12:31,981 --> 02:12:34,890
convert or not convert,
but submit to Islam,

2993
02:12:35,070 --> 02:12:35,903
not criticize it or they blow stuff up.
They thought they bring in some new 

2994
02:12:38,941 --> 02:12:39,774
masculine arm that would make us submit 
and it got so bad that even our own 

2995
02:12:43,261 --> 02:12:46,170
intelligence agencies that had been 
corrupted said,

2996
02:12:46,240 --> 02:12:47,850
this is too far.
We're not doing it.

2997
02:12:49,200 --> 02:12:50,840
And so America,
about four years ago,

2998
02:12:50,850 --> 02:12:51,683
sort of coming back up for air and now 
we're just overthrowing their whole 

2999
02:12:53,881 --> 02:12:55,740
system.
There's a huge war going on.

3000
02:12:56,160 --> 02:12:59,940
It's beautiful.
We're kicking their ass on every front

3001
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:01,600
now.
Like I said,

3002
02:13:01,601 --> 02:13:02,620
at the top,
uh,

3003
02:13:02,810 --> 02:13:03,643
it's a,
it's a,

3004
02:13:03,830 --> 02:13:05,470
it's the,
at the dawn of a new age,

3005
02:13:05,680 --> 02:13:09,640
you were against George W dot Bush,
Clinton,

3006
02:13:09,970 --> 02:13:11,080
Obama,
all that.

3007
02:13:11,081 --> 02:13:13,480
You are not a republican or a democrat.
You weren't,

3008
02:13:13,720 --> 02:13:16,540
you were against government.
But now it's a new day.

3009
02:13:17,110 --> 02:13:19,630
Now the conspiracy theorists like 
yourself,

3010
02:13:19,631 --> 02:13:24,580
you're the king of them were pro 
government and the sheep.

3011
02:13:24,940 --> 02:13:26,920
They're like out there protesting,
crying,

3012
02:13:26,950 --> 02:13:27,783
explain that.

3013
02:13:28,160 --> 02:13:28,730
Well,
I mean,

3014
02:13:28,730 --> 02:13:29,181
look,
it's not.

3015
02:13:29,181 --> 02:13:30,014
That trumps perfect.
He really genuinely like going into all 

3016
02:13:32,521 --> 02:13:34,530
these corporate incentives.
At one side of deals,

3017
02:13:34,531 --> 02:13:36,120
there's no meetings.
Now there's a lobbyist.

3018
02:13:36,240 --> 02:13:37,073
He banned them all for lifetime.
He literally goes in with actuaries and 

3019
02:13:40,351 --> 02:13:41,184
computer programs and ngos who were 
super NSA technology that even had 

3020
02:13:44,671 --> 02:13:48,180
before he was in and he says [inaudible]
the generals came to him years ago.

3021
02:13:48,181 --> 02:13:49,170
They said,
we can deliver all this.

3022
02:13:49,171 --> 02:13:51,060
Everybody,
we don't want to make America poor.

3023
02:13:51,061 --> 02:13:53,670
We don't want to have big wars.
Who wanted to just have prosperity.

3024
02:13:53,671 --> 02:13:55,710
Sarah,
we've got next to free energy.

3025
02:13:55,711 --> 02:13:57,570
All these technologies,
cures for cancer.

3026
02:13:57,840 --> 02:13:58,673
We're ready to release it.
That's why I talked about the state of 

3027
02:13:59,791 --> 02:14:00,820
the union or his,
uh,

3028
02:14:00,821 --> 02:14:01,654
his first inaugural speech and there was
a will be the second and he just really 

3029
02:14:05,851 --> 02:14:08,370
cares about humanity and he's not a 
satanist.

3030
02:14:08,370 --> 02:14:09,203
He doesn't like raping kids.
He likes Super Hot Eastern European 

3031
02:14:11,011 --> 02:14:13,370
women and just,
you know,

3032
02:14:13,371 --> 02:14:14,400
you know,
who wants that?

3033
02:14:14,740 --> 02:14:15,573
He wants a little Kevin,
you can have that just he's not out to 

3034
02:14:18,451 --> 02:14:19,284
get humanity.
And he's got the intelligence agencies 

3035
02:14:20,971 --> 02:14:22,720
totally backing into the hill.
Uh,

3036
02:14:22,890 --> 02:14:25,380
and it's just a super epic moment to be 
alive.

3037
02:14:25,410 --> 02:14:27,880
What's going on so far with trump from 
Iran?

3038
02:14:27,930 --> 02:14:31,880
Hold on one second.
So what do you think when you,

3039
02:14:31,881 --> 02:14:34,740
you said earlier in the podcast,
so you don't think he's perfect,

3040
02:14:34,820 --> 02:14:35,653
right?
What do you think he could do different 

3041
02:14:37,050 --> 02:14:38,490
that would make people accept him?
Well,

3042
02:14:38,491 --> 02:14:40,180
I said last week you should just about 
torture.

3043
02:14:40,181 --> 02:14:42,650
He did the next day just magically 
alias.

3044
02:14:43,360 --> 02:14:44,193
Because that again,
that you came up with the idea and you 

3045
02:14:46,131 --> 02:14:47,880
listened to,
what did you say?

3046
02:14:47,970 --> 02:14:51,240
The tortures the Zeitgeists and I'm in 
the Zeit geist.

3047
02:14:51,540 --> 02:14:54,000
So in that Zeitgeists guy,
she just kind of see everything.

3048
02:14:54,390 --> 02:14:58,860
Even though you're just a normal person,
you can like look into any avenue of any

3049
02:14:58,960 --> 02:14:59,793
your your take on it is that it's good 
to have him in despite whatever flaws 

3050
02:15:04,080 --> 02:15:04,913
people may perceive me as well.
He wants prosperity and he's not a part 

3051
02:15:08,491 --> 02:15:11,040
of the system that he replaced.
That's why they're totally against.

3052
02:15:11,700 --> 02:15:13,990
And he likes full grown women.
Okay.

3053
02:15:14,040 --> 02:15:16,020
I believe that you can only have to say 
that anymore now,

3054
02:15:16,021 --> 02:15:17,200
but I'm just,
I'm just telling you,

3055
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:18,593
most people,
most people acted like to grab the kid 

3056
02:15:20,551 --> 02:15:25,530
out of your backyard and torture him for
a couple of weeks so they kidnap,

3057
02:15:26,250 --> 02:15:27,083
they torture.
They raised kids thought that come 

3058
02:15:29,940 --> 02:15:32,070
combined.
The emails and the emails are like,

3059
02:15:32,071 --> 02:15:33,720
well,
these are kind of exhausted.

3060
02:15:33,721 --> 02:15:35,870
We're about to have to retire them,
so you need to get in there.

3061
02:15:35,890 --> 02:15:39,270
Some of these are damaged.
Look him up.

3062
02:15:39,270 --> 02:15:40,280
He didn't believe me.
No,

3063
02:15:40,350 --> 02:15:41,730
I believed you.
Look,

3064
02:15:41,731 --> 02:15:45,330
I don't know what three year girls in a 
big old guy comes in.

3065
02:15:45,331 --> 02:15:46,164
It just breaks their jaundice.
So do you think trump's going after him 

3066
02:15:49,140 --> 02:15:49,973
least?
What's going on?

3067
02:15:50,130 --> 02:15:50,701
Oh yeah.
Well,

3068
02:15:50,701 --> 02:15:52,140
he's done.
If he's successful,

3069
02:15:52,440 --> 02:15:55,560
it's an entire route.
Like a lot of people aren't just getting

3070
02:15:55,561 --> 02:15:56,394
indicted right now.
They're getting a good to take care of 

3071
02:15:58,831 --> 02:16:01,620
right now about the Vatican and they 
gonna are they weddings?

3072
02:16:01,640 --> 02:16:05,220
How is that punch?
Stop trump.

3073
02:16:05,221 --> 02:16:07,770
He's the devil stopping anything.
We've got stopping.

3074
02:16:08,040 --> 02:16:09,210
That's the Vatican said.
Yeah,

3075
02:16:09,211 --> 02:16:10,680
the Vatican.
Pedophiles central issue.

3076
02:16:10,681 --> 02:16:13,590
Shitting their pants over trump.
The Vatican is so bizarre.

3077
02:16:14,070 --> 02:16:16,530
Imagine truncal and after the Vatican a 
country.

3078
02:16:16,760 --> 02:16:20,620
What's crazy about it is he was,
because I always wanted.

3079
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,100
This is what I ate,
Alex.

3080
02:16:23,101 --> 02:16:26,340
I always thought,
how weird is it that everybody knows?

3081
02:16:26,400 --> 02:16:30,100
South Park is making a goddamn episode 
about them

3082
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:33,940
being pedophiles and get nobody's 
investigating what's going on here,

3083
02:16:34,150 --> 02:16:34,983
so to me,
and then you watch conspiracy of 

3084
02:16:36,371 --> 02:16:38,320
silence.
That documentary that never got released

3085
02:16:38,321 --> 02:16:40,540
about the whole network.
Then you begin to realize,

3086
02:16:40,690 --> 02:16:41,523
Oh shit.
The reason my opinion is the reason no 

3087
02:16:44,381 --> 02:16:48,670
one's getting arrested at the Vatican at
a high rate anyways is because everybody

3088
02:16:48,671 --> 02:16:51,340
at the top is involved.
Let me give you the good news.

3089
02:16:51,370 --> 02:16:53,410
I'm not here to kiss the ass of the 
establishment.

3090
02:16:53,620 --> 02:16:56,440
A lot of patriots in the government who 
have always criticized.

3091
02:16:56,680 --> 02:16:59,680
It ended up being the people that heard 
me bitchy and you bitching do something.

3092
02:16:59,830 --> 02:17:03,310
They'd done something and they're really
trying to reverse this whole thing right

3093
02:17:03,311 --> 02:17:04,144
now and there is a full out war inside 
the government of guys that like to eat 

3094
02:17:08,111 --> 02:17:12,010
steaks and drink beer and have women 
versus a bunch of pot bellied.

3095
02:17:12,010 --> 02:17:13,420
Pedophiles,
Whoa,

3096
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:16,353
Jesus Christ.
What's really fucked up is that the 

3097
02:17:19,301 --> 02:17:23,050
people that before the Sandusky thing 
came out that people rounded,

3098
02:17:23,051 --> 02:17:25,690
probably heard rumors.
That was probably someone who to talk.

3099
02:17:25,700 --> 02:17:27,850
Someone that says something,
but nobody really wanted to believe it.

3100
02:17:28,510 --> 02:17:30,010
When it did happen.
Well,

3101
02:17:30,030 --> 02:17:30,863
in conspiracy of silence is a 
documentary you can watch it never got 

3102
02:17:33,431 --> 02:17:36,250
released.
They're talking about the base,

3103
02:17:36,251 --> 02:17:39,460
the headquarters of the pedophile 
network.

3104
02:17:39,950 --> 02:17:43,150
It's an international network,
is an Omaha,

3105
02:17:43,151 --> 02:17:46,870
Nebraska at boy's town.
They like taking orphans,

3106
02:17:46,900 --> 02:17:48,610
orphans.
There's different levels.

3107
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:50,740
There's guys that we didn't want any 
trouble.

3108
02:17:50,741 --> 02:17:54,180
They just want to sleep and then there's
cycles.

3109
02:17:54,190 --> 02:17:55,023
They want to go kidnap.
There's like the hard core people and 

3110
02:17:58,241 --> 02:17:59,074
you know what?
At top officials and in every aspect of 

3111
02:18:02,891 --> 02:18:06,010
government and celebrity,
it's not everybody,

3112
02:18:06,130 --> 02:18:06,963
but it's enough,
so there's enough people involved that 

3113
02:18:10,270 --> 02:18:13,960
nobody's investigating anybody because 
they're all involved.

3114
02:18:14,100 --> 02:18:14,933
They all better keep their mouths shut 
so crazy that something gets to the 

3115
02:18:17,111 --> 02:18:19,000
level of the Catholic church.
Got To with it.

3116
02:18:19,060 --> 02:18:19,893
Yeah.
No.

3117
02:18:20,700 --> 02:18:25,090
I want to hear about a conversation with
myself and Donald Trump.

3118
02:18:25,150 --> 02:18:26,440
Yes,
sure.

3119
02:18:26,470 --> 02:18:27,490
Go for it.
Allowed to do this.

3120
02:18:27,520 --> 02:18:28,450
Wait a minute.
Before you do it,

3121
02:18:28,850 --> 02:18:29,683
just let him.
Who cares me drunk and high on 

3122
02:18:33,730 --> 02:18:36,220
marijuana.
That was this,

3123
02:18:37,060 --> 02:18:38,030
this,
this.

3124
02:18:38,110 --> 02:18:39,490
Go.
No.

3125
02:18:39,491 --> 02:18:42,430
Trump basically said we're going to 
clean it up,

3126
02:18:42,431 --> 02:18:43,840
Alex.
we know all about it and Alex,

3127
02:18:44,220 --> 02:18:47,620
we're going to stop them and we're going
to do it.

3128
02:18:47,700 --> 02:18:50,440
But he also said Obama's from Kenya.
Well,

3129
02:18:50,441 --> 02:18:52,630
that was when.
That's a huge intelligence op.

3130
02:18:52,631 --> 02:18:53,464
You want to write that down.
You will know about Reagan and was 

3131
02:18:54,521 --> 02:18:58,570
talking about birth certificate.
Now can tell you the full scoop on that.

3132
02:18:58,990 --> 02:18:59,823
What do you think happened there?
I know exactly what they told him that 

3133
02:19:01,960 --> 02:19:03,640
Obama was from Kenya.
They fucked with them.

3134
02:19:04,150 --> 02:19:05,410
They don't hear here right now?
Yes.

3135
02:19:06,190 --> 02:19:07,480
Okay.
I was going to tell a trump story,

3136
02:19:07,481 --> 02:19:07,781
but.
Okay.

3137
02:19:07,781 --> 02:19:08,441
I'll do that.
Good.

3138
02:19:08,441 --> 02:19:12,020
We'll go back to the trump story sharing
and we're good.

3139
02:19:12,021 --> 02:19:12,701
We're good.
Thank you.

3140
02:19:12,701 --> 02:19:14,040
Eddie.
Eddie,

3141
02:19:14,610 --> 02:19:16,420
Bravo.
Jamie.

3142
02:19:16,421 --> 02:19:19,810
You better add extra juice to that time.
Joe.

3143
02:19:20,560 --> 02:19:21,670
Hold on.
Apple juice.

3144
02:19:22,630 --> 02:19:23,800
Apple juice.
Maybe not.

3145
02:19:23,801 --> 02:19:24,640
Alex,
come on.

3146
02:19:24,770 --> 02:19:26,650
Okay.
One secret is Christ.

3147
02:19:26,651 --> 02:19:27,484
If you give me

3148
02:19:28,570 --> 02:19:33,020
minutes,
I'm going to fuck another dimension.

3149
02:19:33,050 --> 02:19:34,250
How many years?
Seven years.

3150
02:19:34,370 --> 02:19:38,060
So we're just about to say what was the.
What was the issue?

3151
02:19:38,450 --> 02:19:40,700
Jesus Christ.
Do you remember what the question wants?

3152
02:19:40,701 --> 02:19:41,534
Jamie?
What Donald Trump told you now that 

3153
02:19:43,371 --> 02:19:44,171
wasn't it.
Yeah.

3154
02:19:44,171 --> 02:19:45,004
No,
you were about to say what Donald Trump 

3155
02:19:45,411 --> 02:19:46,360
told you,
but he knows that about.

3156
02:19:46,380 --> 02:19:49,240
You want to know about something else?
What the fuck is it about?

3157
02:19:49,250 --> 02:19:50,300
But let's leave.
Fuck,

3158
02:19:50,301 --> 02:19:52,610
but hold on a second.
We've on fucking with my memory.

3159
02:19:52,970 --> 02:19:54,040
What was it?
You were just.

3160
02:19:54,080 --> 02:19:55,490
You were just talking about.
I'm not the only one.

3161
02:19:55,491 --> 02:19:57,280
I used to have a good memory.
I don't remember.

3162
02:19:57,550 --> 02:19:58,370
Oh,
we're too high.

3163
02:19:58,370 --> 02:19:59,430
Let's go.
The trump's dot.

3164
02:19:59,480 --> 02:20:01,490
I don't do anything with trump.
Trump.

3165
02:20:01,560 --> 02:20:03,770
Jamie's going to figure it out.
Jamie's going to figure it out.

3166
02:20:03,771 --> 02:20:05,750
What is it that one will tell me?
Just a second.

3167
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:08,360
Someone's going to tell him on twitter 
and we'll figure this out.

3168
02:20:08,361 --> 02:20:10,570
Jesus Christ,
and then I'll write this up.

3169
02:20:10,600 --> 02:20:13,610
Problem with being too high and talking 
over each other.

3170
02:20:13,611 --> 02:20:18,611
He's about to tell you go trump calls 
times a week on average 10 hours show.

3171
02:20:21,080 --> 02:20:21,360
No,
no,

3172
02:20:21,360 --> 02:20:22,850
no.
They should be your longest podcast.

3173
02:20:22,970 --> 02:20:24,830
We will definitely peter out before 
then.

3174
02:20:24,890 --> 02:20:25,230
No,
no,

3175
02:20:25,230 --> 02:20:26,720
no.
It go forever.

3176
02:20:26,790 --> 02:20:31,790
What is no one knows what the fuck we 
were just talking about a minute gap.

3177
02:20:34,220 --> 02:20:35,350
We all forget.
Really?

3178
02:20:35,360 --> 02:20:37,880
Good question because we're blasted you 
better.

3179
02:20:37,970 --> 02:20:40,820
You better call your dispensary and get 
some answers.

3180
02:20:40,821 --> 02:20:41,654
So you were talking about the Vatican.
We were talking about pedophiles in the 

3181
02:20:44,421 --> 02:20:46,050
Catholic church certificate.
Oh,

3182
02:20:47,090 --> 02:20:49,510
that's right.
Okay.

3183
02:20:51,320 --> 02:20:52,153
So tell me what.
It's just a place where I'm not ashamed 

3184
02:20:53,751 --> 02:20:55,980
of this because I got conned.
Went up what I've been calling,

3185
02:20:56,010 --> 02:20:56,661
which happens,
you know,

3186
02:20:56,661 --> 02:20:59,750
every,
every once in a while I admitted later.

3187
02:20:59,751 --> 02:21:01,140
We learned from it.
Okay.

3188
02:21:01,160 --> 02:21:02,830
What happened,
dude?

3189
02:21:05,290 --> 02:21:06,500
Come on.
I only told you it's funny,

3190
02:21:06,501 --> 02:21:08,660
but Kenya,
Kenya,

3191
02:21:09,290 --> 02:21:10,670
Kenya.
Okay.

3192
02:21:11,440 --> 02:21:12,273
And everything.
I'm going to say your listeners can 

3193
02:21:13,521 --> 02:21:14,354
write this down.
They can search engine everything I'm 

3194
02:21:15,831 --> 02:21:19,850
going to say and learned she does for 
themselves because the journey with info

3195
02:21:19,851 --> 02:21:21,680
wars is.
It's not that I'm that smart.

3196
02:21:21,890 --> 02:21:25,190
I'm just like you.
I'm having this journey and I'm going to

3197
02:21:25,191 --> 02:21:25,670
show you.

3198
02:21:25,670 --> 02:21:30,670
So this is what happened when Obama's 
running for office and Hillary's people,

3199
02:21:31,880 --> 02:21:34,100
because I follow the news everyday.
Hillary's campaign,

3200
02:21:34,370 --> 02:21:35,203
this letter came out,
puts out these born in Kenya and I'm 

3201
02:21:37,071 --> 02:21:37,331
like,
yeah,

3202
02:21:37,331 --> 02:21:39,110
screw her.
I was quietly,

3203
02:21:39,470 --> 02:21:41,950
and I'm really ashamed of this,
but I told us there's this.

3204
02:21:41,960 --> 02:21:42,793
I'll just say it.
I was,

3205
02:21:43,370 --> 02:21:47,720
I was an early on Obama supporter in 
that I wanted to try to unify people.

3206
02:21:47,721 --> 02:21:49,580
I didn't like John Mccain,
so I said,

3207
02:21:49,581 --> 02:21:50,450
yeah,
he's bad.

3208
02:21:50,451 --> 02:21:52,460
The Democrats are bad.
But I hated what had happened.

3209
02:21:52,461 --> 02:21:54,770
So much food by Obama to.
Well,

3210
02:21:54,771 --> 02:21:56,300
I was hopeful.
Let's get let him talk.

3211
02:21:56,301 --> 02:21:57,740
I mean,
it wasn't an Obama supporter.

3212
02:21:57,741 --> 02:21:58,574
I just didn't attack him.
And you liked it better than the 

3213
02:21:59,991 --> 02:22:00,760
alternative?
Yeah,

3214
02:22:00,760 --> 02:22:02,900
I didn't push him for office.
I was just like,

3215
02:22:03,080 --> 02:22:03,913
hoping that all this bs was real show.
And then I started hearing these leaks 

3216
02:22:08,840 --> 02:22:10,670
and it was from Hillary.
You can google the city.

3217
02:22:10,671 --> 02:22:14,630
Hillary first pro generated the whole 
the whole deal show.

3218
02:22:14,631 --> 02:22:18,230
I'm sitting there hearing debt,
debt.

3219
02:22:18,320 --> 02:22:19,740
He's born in Kenya,
I think.

3220
02:22:19,840 --> 02:22:21,230
I don't care.
That's a bunch of bs.

3221
02:22:21,680 --> 02:22:22,513
And then the articles started coming out
as the right wing picture that who does 

3222
02:22:24,681 --> 02:22:26,130
the and

3223
02:22:26,130 --> 02:22:30,840
it's his wife and my 2006 and seven in 
speeches going.

3224
02:22:30,841 --> 02:22:33,960
My husband born in Kenya,
knows about the immigrant experience.

3225
02:22:33,961 --> 02:22:35,760
It's video.
You can pull up Michelle Obama.

3226
02:22:35,970 --> 02:22:36,803
Oh yeah.
Pull it up.

3227
02:22:37,380 --> 02:22:41,100
And then.
And then Harvard law review,

3228
02:22:41,101 --> 02:22:42,570
which he headed up for at least three 
years.

3229
02:22:42,571 --> 02:22:44,810
He was the editor and he says,
I was born in Kenya.

3230
02:22:44,811 --> 02:22:46,910
A little bitty bar by buys picture.
Oh yeah.

3231
02:22:47,130 --> 02:22:48,850
Says he's working,
but he wasn't wearing Kenyan.

3232
02:22:48,880 --> 02:22:49,200
Wait,
plug.

3233
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:49,951
Get through this.
Oh.

3234
02:22:49,951 --> 02:22:54,951
So that was just like pizza gate is.
I finally learned how to double cross.

3235
02:22:55,290 --> 02:22:55,501
Well,
it's,

3236
02:22:55,501 --> 02:22:56,880
it's not,
not in pedophilia.

3237
02:22:57,060 --> 02:22:57,700
Hold on,
let's hear.

3238
02:22:57,700 --> 02:22:58,533
Say here you go.

3239
02:22:59,110 --> 02:22:59,943
Let's be testing,
which is still plaguing so many of our 

3240
02:23:02,791 --> 02:23:03,860
communities,
uh,

3241
02:23:04,170 --> 02:23:06,900
which you all know a lot of that is due 
to homophobia.

3242
02:23:07,310 --> 02:23:08,143
But Barack has led by example when we 
took our trip to Africa and visited his 

3243
02:23:13,171 --> 02:23:15,360
home country in Kenya,
uh,

3244
02:23:15,420 --> 02:23:20,420
we'd soak up public HIV test for the 
very point of showing folks in Canada.

3245
02:23:21,750 --> 02:23:22,583
Okay.
But that doesn't mean that he was 

3246
02:23:23,221 --> 02:23:26,070
listening to the club,
he just found that fast.

3247
02:23:26,071 --> 02:23:26,904
But there's another where she said,
and there's the Harvard law review when 

3248
02:23:29,061 --> 02:23:29,910
she edited,
where he says,

3249
02:23:29,911 --> 02:23:31,790
I was born in Kenya.
Okay,

3250
02:23:31,860 --> 02:23:34,620
well that shit up right there.
Or was she saying is his homeland?

3251
02:23:34,621 --> 02:23:35,454
Like if you're from Ireland,
like I didn't want to go back to Italy 

3252
02:23:39,061 --> 02:23:42,150
or Ireland or totally land.
They call it the homeland.

3253
02:23:42,210 --> 02:23:43,043
But listen,
let's just going onto what are we 

3254
02:23:44,721 --> 02:23:47,370
covering?
Kenya trump certificate.

3255
02:23:47,600 --> 02:23:48,990
So yeah,
trump got involved in all that.

3256
02:23:49,640 --> 02:23:50,910
An old bursar.
We'll go ahead.

3257
02:23:51,180 --> 02:23:51,630
No,
no.

3258
02:23:51,630 --> 02:23:52,463
So how did,
what did someone leak that information 

3259
02:23:54,511 --> 02:23:56,940
to him to try to make him look foolish?
Because he chased after it.

3260
02:23:57,030 --> 02:24:00,390
Yes.
So we're just researching.

3261
02:24:00,391 --> 02:24:01,560
It's anybody from anybody.
Foolish.

3262
02:24:01,620 --> 02:24:02,453
So do you think they just maybe made an 
incorrect judge that we found out all 

3263
02:24:05,161 --> 02:24:05,490
about it.

3264
02:24:05,490 --> 02:24:10,490
This is stunning information show people
want to say he's illegitimate.

3265
02:24:12,540 --> 02:24:15,250
They then look at him in the Harvard law
review saying he's in Kenya,

3266
02:24:15,251 --> 02:24:16,084
we look at clubs,
they look at the fact that he won't 

3267
02:24:17,401 --> 02:24:18,630
release his birth certificate.
He had a name,

3268
02:24:18,631 --> 02:24:23,631
name Barry Satara and Indonesia.
He had all these weird cut out names.

3269
02:24:25,320 --> 02:24:27,840
All he had like five alias.
Wow.

3270
02:24:28,020 --> 02:24:28,853
Why did he wrote that?
He wrote dream look it up because he 

3271
02:24:31,500 --> 02:24:35,040
wrote dreams of my real father or dreams
of my father.

3272
02:24:35,250 --> 02:24:39,060
My real father is the documentary and in
and he talks about Frank Marshall Davis,

3273
02:24:39,420 --> 02:24:43,140
the communist famous pornographer that 
he spit summers with.

3274
02:24:43,141 --> 02:24:44,550
He looked side by sides,
the same guy,

3275
02:24:44,850 --> 02:24:47,400
so they were worried that it was gonna 
be Frank Marshall Davis,

3276
02:24:47,970 --> 02:24:52,020
but it had actually been his mom in like
a scam making money off.

3277
02:24:52,080 --> 02:24:52,913
She was CIA bringing back people in the 
US and sham marriage is to have them 

3278
02:24:55,741 --> 02:24:59,370
integrate.
It was basically a cover up.

3279
02:24:59,380 --> 02:25:01,290
The fact that his real father was frank,
Marshall Davis,

3280
02:25:01,291 --> 02:25:02,124
the Communist,
and so that's who Obama's real dad was 

3281
02:25:06,600 --> 02:25:08,490
and dreams.
My real father breaks it all down.

3282
02:25:08,491 --> 02:25:10,470
It's online and it's pretty powerful 
info.

3283
02:25:11,370 --> 02:25:12,203
So what does that mean?
It just is a perfect example of you're 

3284
02:25:16,471 --> 02:25:20,270
not born in Kenya,
you're really born in Hawaii on the main

3285
02:25:20,320 --> 02:25:24,580
city based island.
Honolulu to Frank Marshall Davis.

3286
02:25:25,060 --> 02:25:26,460
And your grandfather,
CIA,

3287
02:25:26,480 --> 02:25:29,080
your mother's CIA.
That's all been declassified here.

3288
02:25:29,081 --> 02:25:31,630
This cutout puts mom was a CIA.
Oh yeah.

3289
02:25:31,750 --> 02:25:33,490
What was she.
What did she do for the CIA?

3290
02:25:33,520 --> 02:25:37,340
She was a sex operator.
Yeah.

3291
02:25:37,560 --> 02:25:38,121
And,
and,

3292
02:25:38,121 --> 02:25:38,954
and she posed for news photos and kind 
of Betty Page style was sex operatives 

3293
02:25:43,190 --> 02:25:45,470
in photos at Frank Marshall Davis,
his house.

3294
02:25:47,530 --> 02:25:49,120
And you know this because you've seen 
these.

3295
02:25:49,690 --> 02:25:50,380
I've interviewed the people

3296
02:25:50,380 --> 02:25:51,213
will involved.
I've read dreams of my father where he 

3297
02:25:53,171 --> 02:25:55,420
admits I stayed at Frank Marshall Davis,
his house.

3298
02:25:55,600 --> 02:25:56,433
He was like my dad.
My grandfather had a special unspoken 

3299
02:25:58,721 --> 02:26:00,670
relationship with them.
Quotes.

3300
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:02,350
Look up Obama,
frank,

3301
02:26:02,351 --> 02:26:04,800
Marshall,
Davis or Obama's father.

3302
02:26:05,290 --> 02:26:06,123
What do you think about the conspiracy 
theory that the Obama was bred by the 

3303
02:26:09,911 --> 02:26:12,880
CIA the whole way through all the truths
on a third.

3304
02:26:13,050 --> 02:26:14,430
Oh really?
When you say see I,

3305
02:26:14,450 --> 02:26:15,400
that just means like

3306
02:26:16,610 --> 02:26:17,443
a marketing project.
If whoever was in power at the time for 

3307
02:26:20,421 --> 02:26:22,100
eight years,
whoever's in charge of that,

3308
02:26:22,250 --> 02:26:23,083
whoever shows interest can go in and 
then just basically be involved in 

3309
02:26:26,811 --> 02:26:30,770
controlling the levers of the social 
engineering of the society.

3310
02:26:32,080 --> 02:26:33,970
So what does that have to do with Obama 
growing up?

3311
02:26:33,971 --> 02:26:34,804
Did were those rumors that he was in a 
CIA agent and Pakistan while he was 

3312
02:26:40,541 --> 02:26:42,040
supposed to be in Columbia?

3313
02:26:42,840 --> 02:26:43,860
Probably.
Exactly.

3314
02:26:43,950 --> 02:26:45,440
He probably spent six months.
Yeah.

3315
02:26:45,450 --> 02:26:46,283
There's the supposed father Barack 
versus the second versus frame marshal 

3316
02:26:49,380 --> 02:26:53,520
dose.
I think you look more like the other.

3317
02:26:53,521 --> 02:26:54,490
Barack.
Okay.

3318
02:26:54,870 --> 02:26:56,400
Well look up,
look up,

3319
02:26:56,430 --> 02:26:57,263
look up frank.
Marshall Davis is pornography and it's 

3320
02:26:59,440 --> 02:27:03,300
mine and I will do no such than Obama's 
mother.

3321
02:27:03,301 --> 02:27:06,570
Clearly in the photos.
And here's his book.

3322
02:27:06,571 --> 02:27:10,260
Dreams of my father admitting that he 
stayed with Frank Marshall Davis.

3323
02:27:10,660 --> 02:27:11,401
Okay.
But,

3324
02:27:11,401 --> 02:27:12,660
but listen,
that's not the issue.

3325
02:27:12,720 --> 02:27:13,770
So the,
we would,

3326
02:27:13,771 --> 02:27:14,604
I asked you though to get back to where 
we started from was why did trump chase 

3327
02:27:19,141 --> 02:27:20,670
after that whole.
He was born in Kenya.

3328
02:27:20,671 --> 02:27:21,504
Shit for so long because he knew it was 
super hot with the public and he wanted 

3329
02:27:25,111 --> 02:27:25,944
to know the answer to it as well.
And didn't like the things Obama was 

3330
02:27:28,981 --> 02:27:30,220
doing.
Hmm.

3331
02:27:32,720 --> 02:27:34,040
It was a weird thing,
right?

3332
02:27:34,310 --> 02:27:35,143
Because,
uh,

3333
02:27:35,180 --> 02:27:36,013
if you were a guy who was a white guy 
and we wanted to prove that you're born 

3334
02:27:39,681 --> 02:27:40,514
in Austria,

3335
02:27:41,750 --> 02:27:44,150
but you had some birth certificate that 
said you were born in the United States,

3336
02:27:44,151 --> 02:27:47,180
he spoke perfect English but yet a 
square jaw and you look like you're from

3337
02:27:47,181 --> 02:27:48,014
the frozen north.
Like this motherfucker is freeze from 

3338
02:27:50,421 --> 02:27:51,350
Austria.
Dude,

3339
02:27:51,351 --> 02:27:53,090
I'm telling you,
these from fucking Austria.

3340
02:27:53,390 --> 02:27:54,223
And then someone like made a big deal 
out of it gave you like a fake birth 

3341
02:27:56,781 --> 02:28:00,550
certificate and people wouldn't do.
You'd never hear racism then.

3342
02:28:00,560 --> 02:28:02,420
Interesting.
Like you would hear that.

3343
02:28:02,421 --> 02:28:04,220
Yeah,
this guy might have been born in another

3344
02:28:04,221 --> 02:28:07,330
country but it wouldn't be president.
So yeah,

3345
02:28:07,460 --> 02:28:08,293
it's a race.
I mean,

3346
02:28:08,600 --> 02:28:10,850
instantaneously it gets connected to 
racism.

3347
02:28:10,851 --> 02:28:14,100
There's an assumed racism with almost 
any there.

3348
02:28:14,150 --> 02:28:15,350
What color?
Barack Obama.

3349
02:28:15,351 --> 02:28:18,080
When he accusation you have any Henry 
Su's music.

3350
02:28:18,290 --> 02:28:20,180
I'm here.
What color he is along the watchtower is

3351
02:28:20,181 --> 02:28:21,980
the best ever.
That's pretty God damn good

3352
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:22,940
song.
Yeah.

3353
02:28:22,941 --> 02:28:23,774
All of that show.
All I'm telling you is you researched 

3354
02:28:26,901 --> 02:28:27,411
frank,
Marshall,

3355
02:28:27,411 --> 02:28:29,420
Davis and Obama,
I believe it is.

3356
02:28:29,470 --> 02:28:31,460
It's cracking and believe how inclusive 
it is.

3357
02:28:31,700 --> 02:28:33,800
My Mom and dad are we talking about like
five years ago.

3358
02:28:33,801 --> 02:28:34,634
They thought,
that's crazy.

3359
02:28:34,910 --> 02:28:36,500
Let us see the film about it.
They saw it.

3360
02:28:36,501 --> 02:28:38,120
They were blown away,
but listen,

3361
02:28:38,121 --> 02:28:38,954
let me give you the big picture please.
The elite admit that they are studying 

3362
02:28:41,961 --> 02:28:43,970
humanity like they're a breakaway 
civilization.

3363
02:28:44,240 --> 02:28:45,073
They believe they're taking the best 
ideas of humanity and building a 

3364
02:28:47,721 --> 02:28:48,554
breakaway civilization of technocracy 
show they can transcend us and I want 

3365
02:28:52,521 --> 02:28:53,354
the public to know the decision has been
made dumb you down balkanize you turn 

3366
02:28:57,171 --> 02:28:59,480
you against yourselves,
have regional wars,

3367
02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:00,673
play people off against each other and 
then basically released bioweapons that 

3368
02:29:04,071 --> 02:29:07,220
wipe out most of the population,
all the Atlantic transcendent.

3369
02:29:07,850 --> 02:29:08,930
Pause.
This right here.

3370
02:29:09,050 --> 02:29:11,150
Who are the elite like when you say the 
elite,

3371
02:29:11,210 --> 02:29:14,520
who are these people and how do they get
together her?

3372
02:29:14,770 --> 02:29:16,580
Hold on a second.
How do they all agree?

3373
02:29:16,760 --> 02:29:19,610
Who Votes?
How do they decide is a bunch of towels?

3374
02:29:19,940 --> 02:29:23,210
Let me type a super billionaire 
characters like run and shit.

3375
02:29:23,270 --> 02:29:26,010
So how do they get together and all 
agree on the data side,

3376
02:29:26,090 --> 02:29:26,923
on agendas that will empower their 
individual agendas and they're pretty 

3377
02:29:29,091 --> 02:29:32,350
much let into those power structures 
early on side of the men.

3378
02:29:32,420 --> 02:29:35,960
They are a group that was the Bilderberg
Group Club of Rome.

3379
02:29:35,990 --> 02:29:38,330
Bilderberg group.
It's the club of Rome Davis.

3380
02:29:39,170 --> 02:29:41,630
A club of Rome is a population reduction
group.

3381
02:29:41,631 --> 02:29:43,160
I mean,
if you can go to infowars.com

3382
02:29:43,161 --> 02:29:47,110
right now there's an article and a video
I cut about Oprah Winfrey.

3383
02:29:47,130 --> 02:29:50,990
I'm not saying it's a bad person or 
she's part of a secret eugenics group.

3384
02:29:51,050 --> 02:29:52,280
Hold on a second.
Stop right there.

3385
02:29:52,281 --> 02:29:54,500
Only for opposite.
I'm not saying she's a bad person,

3386
02:29:54,501 --> 02:29:57,080
but he's part of a secret eugenics 
group.

3387
02:29:59,810 --> 02:30:03,050
I'm a really good progressive.
I like killing weak people.

3388
02:30:03,320 --> 02:30:05,750
I'm just trying to thin the herd.
I'm a really good person though.

3389
02:30:06,070 --> 02:30:07,260
Yeah,
that's hilarious.

3390
02:30:07,310 --> 02:30:10,160
Just absolutely.
So you can go there.

3391
02:30:10,161 --> 02:30:11,900
It's the truth about Oprah Winfrey.
Okay.

3392
02:30:11,980 --> 02:30:14,130
And.
And it just deals with it in the news.

3393
02:30:14,810 --> 02:30:17,540
Oprah Winfrey and secret meeting face.
He looks so serious.

3394
02:30:17,640 --> 02:30:18,620
I was like,
I toilet.

3395
02:30:18,680 --> 02:30:21,230
You think she's in secret meetings with 
like the Bilderberg group or something?

3396
02:30:21,560 --> 02:30:22,393
She admits that to repo.
They admit on the news to reduce 

3397
02:30:25,161 --> 02:30:25,994
population because we linked at first,
but let's play it know when someone 

3398
02:30:30,720 --> 02:30:31,553
might hold please.
When someone like her says something 

3399
02:30:34,790 --> 02:30:35,623
about reducing the amount of 
illegitimate babies born or the amount 

3400
02:30:38,661 --> 02:30:41,060
of babies that are born because there's 
no birth control.

3401
02:30:41,270 --> 02:30:45,800
A lot of times those kind of statements 
get construed into population control.

3402
02:30:45,830 --> 02:30:46,663
She's in the car and beat and people 
start saying she's into population 

3403
02:30:49,491 --> 02:30:53,690
control and that means she wants in the 
secret meetings and she's pushing in and

3404
02:30:53,691 --> 02:30:54,650
she's tax exempt.

3405
02:30:54,710 --> 02:30:56,910
I'm not in those secret meetings.
Are you in those secret meetings?

3406
02:30:57,190 --> 02:30:58,023
You go to the failings that we like to.
Have you ever been in one of those 

3407
02:31:00,051 --> 02:31:01,450
secret meetings?
I did check into one.

3408
02:31:01,490 --> 02:31:02,980
Do you hear what they said?
Yes.

3409
02:31:02,981 --> 02:31:05,840
Did they say they want to kill half the 
people know what they say.

3410
02:31:05,841 --> 02:31:07,640
That was really shocking to Bohemian 
Grove.

3411
02:31:07,641 --> 02:31:09,770
It wasn't.
I remember that dude.

3412
02:31:09,780 --> 02:31:11,270
That was the.
That was the real shit.

3413
02:31:12,170 --> 02:31:13,003
Fucking Jim Brown type shit dude.
I mean that is like if you want to go 

3414
02:31:15,891 --> 02:31:19,290
back to like conspiracy theory,
fuel like that,

3415
02:31:19,291 --> 02:31:19,980
get excited about

3416
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:20,813
something when you find out that there 
really are a bunch of global elites to 

3417
02:31:23,371 --> 02:31:28,270
get on this ranch and they got a fucking
giant stone owl and they burn a,

3418
02:31:28,271 --> 02:31:32,970
a bundle of wood in effigy and they all 
were fucking masks and Shit and then you

3419
02:31:32,971 --> 02:31:37,200
actually have video footage of it and 
there's weird sort of a ceremony they're

3420
02:31:37,201 --> 02:31:41,670
doing and whether or not they're 
pretending you're pretending it is,

3421
02:31:41,870 --> 02:31:43,320
whatever,
whatever it is,

3422
02:31:43,321 --> 02:31:47,520
it's crazier and I was there and they 
have exactly what it is.

3423
02:31:47,590 --> 02:31:49,020
Yeah,
go into that.

3424
02:31:49,130 --> 02:31:50,850
How did you sneak into the Bohemian 
Grove?

3425
02:31:50,851 --> 02:31:51,930
That was amazing.
Well,

3426
02:31:51,931 --> 02:31:53,600
people always said it was a Saturday,
let me.

3427
02:31:53,610 --> 02:31:54,443
And it wasn't quite like that,
but we had an insider wanted to get me 

3428
02:31:56,521 --> 02:31:58,800
in to actually see it and most people 
aren't bad that go to it.

3429
02:31:59,100 --> 02:32:01,680
But the point is,
it's kind of a gateway into all of this.

3430
02:32:02,020 --> 02:32:02,853
It's amazing.
So this is you at Bohemian Grove and 

3431
02:32:04,831 --> 02:32:06,770
you're in,
you're on the other side of liquor.

3432
02:32:06,780 --> 02:32:08,010
It looks like a little pond or 
something.

3433
02:32:08,340 --> 02:32:10,560
Feel free to play it.
It goes beyond old care.

3434
02:32:10,740 --> 02:32:13,800
May fire make merriment with your dust 
where you go,

3435
02:32:13,820 --> 02:32:16,620
no care.
It was so strange.

3436
02:32:16,680 --> 02:32:17,513
It was so bizarre.
Listening to that guy and the speaker 

3437
02:32:19,740 --> 02:32:22,630
blaring out across the cronkite play it 
put lit.

3438
02:32:22,670 --> 02:32:24,540
Let's.
Let's play of that was Walter cronkite.

3439
02:32:30,540 --> 02:32:31,920
Oh,

3440
02:32:36,690 --> 02:32:38,490
sounds like a play for high school.
It is.

3441
02:32:38,491 --> 02:32:39,324
It's all play,

3442
02:32:40,560 --> 02:32:44,010
but religion started that way as as,
as entertainment.

3443
02:32:44,160 --> 02:32:44,993
So what do you think?
This is just some really ancient ritual 

3444
02:32:47,251 --> 02:32:48,450
that they're redoing.
Yeah.

3445
02:32:48,451 --> 02:32:49,284
I thought it was no big deal till I was 
in the crown of old men that were 

3446
02:32:51,240 --> 02:32:52,530
lavishing.
They were like,

3447
02:32:52,620 --> 02:32:53,453
they loved it.
I certainly had jackie lighting and 

3448
02:32:54,291 --> 02:32:56,680
their pants.
Are you sure?

3449
02:32:57,810 --> 02:32:59,370
Are you projecting?
No,

3450
02:32:59,371 --> 02:33:00,860
no.
They were like to see.

3451
02:33:02,550 --> 02:33:05,340
What is it about people that love those 
secret societies?

3452
02:33:05,370 --> 02:33:06,203
Like you remember that jfk speech about 
secret societies who will not tolerate 

3453
02:33:08,731 --> 02:33:09,271
them.
Yeah.

3454
02:33:09,271 --> 02:33:11,040
It's a fucking beautiful speech.
Well,

3455
02:33:11,160 --> 02:33:12,630
because I'll pull it up,
Jimmy,

3456
02:33:12,750 --> 02:33:17,750
pull up jfk speech about what power over
others that don't crave secret essence,

3457
02:33:18,230 --> 02:33:20,370
right?
They're looking for that secret place.

3458
02:33:20,400 --> 02:33:21,840
The most high.
Yeah,

3459
02:33:21,870 --> 02:33:23,320
no,
absolutely.

3460
02:33:23,350 --> 02:33:24,183
That's,
but that's just like you were talking 

3461
02:33:25,051 --> 02:33:26,940
about pedophiles,
just like you know,

3462
02:33:26,941 --> 02:33:30,440
any other deviant.
Fuck yeah.

3463
02:33:30,760 --> 02:33:34,380
I just want to go eat a big pile of 
steaks and drink some beer.

3464
02:33:34,500 --> 02:33:36,570
I say,
let's crank this up.

3465
02:33:37,600 --> 02:33:38,433
Ladies and gentlemen.
The very word secrecy is repugnant in a 

3466
02:33:42,791 --> 02:33:43,624
free and open society and we are as a 
people inherently and historically 

3467
02:33:49,630 --> 02:33:52,810
opposed to secret societies to secret 
oaths

3468
02:33:53,430 --> 02:33:55,230
and a secret proceeding.
I'm by myself,

3469
02:33:55,231 --> 02:33:56,064
but case please don't put this on.
I don't know if you've ever heard this 

3470
02:33:58,830 --> 02:34:01,080
excessive and I'm just talking about 
secret societies

3471
02:34:01,490 --> 02:34:02,323
of pertinent facts far outweigh the 
dangers which are cited to justify it 

3472
02:34:08,090 --> 02:34:08,923
even today.
There is little value in opposing the 

3473
02:34:11,631 --> 02:34:16,460
threat of a closed society by imitating 
its arbitrary restrictions.

3474
02:34:17,320 --> 02:34:18,153
Even today,
there is little value in ensuring the 

3475
02:34:20,861 --> 02:34:25,861
survival of our nation if our traditions
do not survive with it and there is very

3476
02:34:27,251 --> 02:34:28,084
grave danger that an announced need for 
increased security will be seized upon 

3477
02:34:33,821 --> 02:34:34,654
by those anxious to expand its meaning 
to the very limits of official 

3478
02:34:38,520 --> 02:34:39,353
censorship and concealment.
That I do not intend to permit to the 

3479
02:34:43,601 --> 02:34:48,220
extent that it's in my control and no 
official of my administration,

3480
02:34:48,250 --> 02:34:53,250
whether his rank is high or low,
civilian or military should interpret my

3481
02:34:53,531 --> 02:34:58,531
words here tonight as an excuse to 
censor the news to stifle dissent.

3482
02:34:58,840 --> 02:34:59,673
They knew it to cover up our mistakes or
to withhold from the press and the 

3483
02:35:03,641 --> 02:35:06,310
public,
the facts they deserve to know,

3484
02:35:07,590 --> 02:35:08,423
but we are opposed around the world by a
monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that 

3485
02:35:13,991 --> 02:35:14,824
relies primarily on covet means for 
expanding its sphere of influence on 

3486
02:35:19,961 --> 02:35:20,794
infiltration instead of invasion on 
severity instead of elections on 

3487
02:35:26,531 --> 02:35:31,531
intimidation instead of free choice on 
guerrillas by night instead of armies by

3488
02:35:32,831 --> 02:35:33,664
day.

3489
02:35:34,240 --> 02:35:35,073
It is a system which has conscripted 
vast human and material resources into 

3490
02:35:40,421 --> 02:35:41,254
the building of a tightly knit,
highly efficient machine that combines 

3491
02:35:45,461 --> 02:35:48,790
military,
diplomatic intelligence,

3492
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:52,420
economic science comments,
political operations.

3493
02:35:53,200 --> 02:35:56,110
Its preparations are concealed,
not published.

3494
02:35:56,650 --> 02:35:59,290
It's mistakes have buried,
not headlined,

3495
02:35:59,920 --> 02:36:02,800
its dissenters.
A silenced not praised.

3496
02:36:03,430 --> 02:36:06,610
No expenditure is questioned.
No rumor is printed.

3497
02:36:07,150 --> 02:36:12,150
No secret is revealed.
No president should face public scrutiny

3498
02:36:12,580 --> 02:36:13,413
of his program.
For from that scrutiny comes 

3499
02:36:15,671 --> 02:36:16,504
understanding and from that 
understanding comes support or 

3500
02:36:19,601 --> 02:36:20,434
opposition and both unnecessary.
I'm not asking your newspapers to 

3501
02:36:24,491 --> 02:36:25,324
support an administration,
but I am asking your help approach and 

3502
02:36:29,471 --> 02:36:30,304
the tremendous task of informing and 
alerting the American people for I have 

3503
02:36:34,871 --> 02:36:35,770
complete confidence

3504
02:36:38,140 --> 02:36:40,000
kilter.
That's a.

3505
02:36:40,370 --> 02:36:41,203
that's such a crazy speech because it's 
him talking about the structures that 

3506
02:36:44,541 --> 02:36:45,374
were already in place and about the 
dangers of withholding information for 

3507
02:36:48,951 --> 02:36:49,784
people and him being forthright as a 
president in a way that we've never 

3508
02:36:53,781 --> 02:36:56,630
heard before since like he's literally 
talking,

3509
02:36:56,870 --> 02:36:57,890
Jill trump,
trump,

3510
02:36:57,950 --> 02:36:58,641
trump,
spending like that.

3511
02:36:58,641 --> 02:36:59,960
Now,
what a trump tell you.

3512
02:37:00,590 --> 02:37:01,160
Well,
we.

3513
02:37:01,160 --> 02:37:01,993
Let's just be clear.
He's talking about our own military 

3514
02:37:04,041 --> 02:37:06,110
industrial complex that Eisenhower 
warned about.

3515
02:37:06,170 --> 02:37:08,960
His outgoing predecessor.
He's talking about the Soviets there.

3516
02:37:08,961 --> 02:37:10,850
At the same time,
he was a really smart cookie.

3517
02:37:11,030 --> 02:37:13,840
The Eisenhower warning is one of the 
creepiest things in human history.

3518
02:37:14,680 --> 02:37:15,710
Really?
Military,

3519
02:37:15,711 --> 02:37:16,010
industrial

3520
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:16,730
complex.
Okay.

3521
02:37:16,730 --> 02:37:18,350
That sounded like he was talking about 
communism.

3522
02:37:18,380 --> 02:37:19,213
Yeah.
Pull up our warns of the Military 

3523
02:37:22,010 --> 02:37:23,240
Industrial Complex.
He did it,

3524
02:37:23,390 --> 02:37:24,223
but just go.
There's a clip that just has that 

3525
02:37:26,120 --> 02:37:28,940
segment of it will be so yeah,
there was a lot.

3526
02:37:28,970 --> 02:37:29,803
He says there is a scientific 
technocratic elite that has had the 

3527
02:37:33,110 --> 02:37:37,100
control of all information about to shut
it down to the public and then they will

3528
02:37:37,101 --> 02:37:40,040
control the military,
so beware of the military.

3529
02:37:40,220 --> 02:37:41,570
He was in the military.
It was bad.

3530
02:37:41,840 --> 02:37:44,690
He said these 10 military industrial 
eugenicist.

3531
02:37:44,900 --> 02:37:45,733
We're about to get control of it.
The scientific people are telling you 

3532
02:37:47,471 --> 02:37:49,350
about.
See if you can find where it goes.

3533
02:37:49,360 --> 02:37:51,600
It Jamie,
this is the address right here is

3534
02:37:53,840 --> 02:37:54,673
we now stand 10 years past the midpoint 
of a century that has witnessed for 

3535
02:37:58,920 --> 02:38:00,850
major war among great naked

3536
02:38:06,850 --> 02:38:11,000
chose ride type in eisenhower military 
industrial complex speech.

3537
02:38:11,001 --> 02:38:13,250
Yeah,
he's going to say it in here somewhere,

3538
02:38:13,251 --> 02:38:17,570
but it's a three minute speech at CCV,
Alex.

3539
02:38:17,630 --> 02:38:20,020
it seems like trump,
you know everybody,

3540
02:38:20,180 --> 02:38:23,180
a lot of smart people in different 
points of their life,

3541
02:38:23,510 --> 02:38:27,500
they begin to realize how much,
how many lives they've been told.

3542
02:38:27,501 --> 02:38:29,720
They begin to wake up.
They're not totally woke up,

3543
02:38:29,721 --> 02:38:33,170
but they begin to wake up and then they 
find out about nine slash 11,

3544
02:38:33,171 --> 02:38:35,720
but that don't believe all this other 
shit and then they find out about this,

3545
02:38:35,721 --> 02:38:36,890
but they don't believe in all that other
shit.

3546
02:38:37,010 --> 02:38:37,843
Then they find out about that and then 
at the very high level it's like the 

3547
02:38:39,861 --> 02:38:40,730
dudes,
they're like,

3548
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:42,830
yeah,
all this shit is true.

3549
02:38:42,831 --> 02:38:45,380
If you could follow the money,
it's probably true.

3550
02:38:45,440 --> 02:38:47,630
You might be wrong one or two or three 
times,

3551
02:38:47,840 --> 02:38:51,710
but generally we're dealing with a 
totally crooked situation.

3552
02:38:51,880 --> 02:38:52,713
That's what are they doing?
They're not stealing money from 

3553
02:38:54,111 --> 02:38:56,330
corporations.
You steal money from a corporation.

3554
02:38:56,331 --> 02:38:57,770
They're going to come after you and kill
you.

3555
02:38:58,080 --> 02:38:58,913
Uh,
with what they're doing is the mastery 

3556
02:39:01,161 --> 02:39:01,994
of stealing tax money.
That's what this is all about is just 

3557
02:39:05,810 --> 02:39:06,643
stealing tax because nobody,
because nobody's going to go after tax 

3558
02:39:12,201 --> 02:39:13,034
money.
You get all these programs and these 

3559
02:39:13,911 --> 02:39:17,150
bills pass.
Let's play this good Jamie.

3560
02:39:17,330 --> 02:39:21,530
These military contracts,
the tax payers are paying for all this.

3561
02:39:21,740 --> 02:39:22,573
Their livelihood are all involved.
So is the very structure of our society 

3562
02:39:28,170 --> 02:39:29,003
in the councils of government.
I'm going to guard against the 

3563
02:39:31,671 --> 02:39:32,504
acquisition of unwarranted influence,
whether sought or unsought by the 

3564
02:39:36,441 --> 02:39:41,441
military industrial complex.
The potential for the disastrous rise of

3565
02:39:42,111 --> 02:39:42,944
misplaced power exists and will persist.
We must never let the weight of this 

3566
02:39:48,111 --> 02:39:51,740
combination in danger,
our liberties or democratic processes,

3567
02:39:52,070 --> 02:39:52,903
Jesus Christ.
Just let that out like it was so tight 

3568
02:39:54,880 --> 02:39:58,610
because you think about this back in the
early days of radio,

3569
02:39:58,611 --> 02:40:03,611
in the early days of moving pictures 
only finish.

3570
02:40:04,790 --> 02:40:08,690
Only the elite had access to this 
technology.

3571
02:40:08,691 --> 02:40:12,320
Moving pictures radio right from the get
go,

3572
02:40:12,440 --> 02:40:13,840
right day one

3573
02:40:15,090 --> 02:40:15,923
right from day one.
It wasn't like your average guy was 

3574
02:40:18,301 --> 02:40:21,090
trying to help humanity.
The guys who had this technology,

3575
02:40:21,210 --> 02:40:22,110
we're like,
damn.

3576
02:40:22,650 --> 02:40:25,620
They believe whatever the fuck we say 
back in the day,

3577
02:40:25,621 --> 02:40:26,454
you'd listen to the radio,
those news reports or when the movie 

3578
02:40:28,261 --> 02:40:31,230
pictures were from madness.
Yes,

3579
02:40:31,290 --> 02:40:34,140
that's what I'm talking about right from
the get go TV,

3580
02:40:34,230 --> 02:40:36,360
movies,
radio.

3581
02:40:36,750 --> 02:40:40,020
All of it was propaganda.
It never left.

3582
02:40:40,440 --> 02:40:42,390
Alex Jones is aliens involved in this 
story.

3583
02:40:42,391 --> 02:40:46,200
Please talk about propaganda and movies 
and Howard had ll limits.

3584
02:40:46,201 --> 02:40:47,040
Sir,
come to him.

3585
02:40:47,400 --> 02:40:49,320
Who was the chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs?

3586
02:40:49,510 --> 02:40:53,100
All linen answers that is now just 
google operation northwoods.

3587
02:40:53,310 --> 02:40:54,150
Oh,
I know about that.

3588
02:40:54,210 --> 02:40:56,430
Sure.
So they came to them and they said,

3589
02:40:57,330 --> 02:41:00,420
we're going to launch terror attacks in 
America and start a war with the Soviet.

3590
02:41:00,421 --> 02:41:00,931
She's like,
well,

3591
02:41:00,931 --> 02:41:02,580
I know they're evil,
but we're not gonna do that.

3592
02:41:02,580 --> 02:41:04,910
So he fired him.
The JFK comes here.

3593
02:41:04,940 --> 02:41:08,100
The same guys had to make him do it.
He refuses.

3594
02:41:08,101 --> 02:41:09,240
So they kill him.
Well,

3595
02:41:09,241 --> 02:41:10,074
they wanted to have a drone jetliners 
and blow them up and blame it on the 

3596
02:41:13,381 --> 02:41:14,820
Cubans.
Nine slash 11.

3597
02:41:14,850 --> 02:41:18,180
They wanted to arm Cuban friendlies and 
attack Guantanamo Bay.

3598
02:41:18,181 --> 02:41:20,400
They had a bunch of really crazy shit 
planned.

3599
02:41:20,670 --> 02:41:21,503
When you realize what our operation 
northwoods was and you realized that 

3600
02:41:23,881 --> 02:41:26,070
this was signed by the joint chiefs of 
staff,

3601
02:41:26,071 --> 02:41:30,030
it scares the shit out of you.
Is this real?

3602
02:41:30,100 --> 02:41:32,250
What?
We're all talking here.

3603
02:41:32,251 --> 02:41:33,210
We're talking here.
Does it?

3604
02:41:33,240 --> 02:41:34,073
Doesn't that scare the shit out of you?
Doesn't blow your mind that still today 

3605
02:41:38,911 --> 02:41:39,744
it's 2017.
Doesn't it blow your mind that people 

3606
02:41:42,391 --> 02:41:43,224
still think that nine slash 11 happened 
the way it was we'll get to in 

3607
02:41:47,120 --> 02:41:52,120
northridge is 100 percent crazy back to 
the city classified 2000.

3608
02:41:53,150 --> 02:41:55,380
Well,
when people realize that that was a real

3609
02:41:55,381 --> 02:41:57,310
documents,
the US government plan to start war with

3610
02:41:57,330 --> 02:41:59,830
Russia and kill people and blow up movie
theaters,

3611
02:41:59,850 --> 02:42:02,490
attack US military basis,
kill American civilians,

3612
02:42:02,560 --> 02:42:04,460
capital,
kill American military food.

3613
02:42:04,500 --> 02:42:06,500
People hijack jets,
crashing them.

3614
02:42:06,750 --> 02:42:08,100
Have she,
I ain't get on board.

3615
02:42:08,101 --> 02:42:10,570
So fake plane lands are the real plane 
lands.

3616
02:42:10,571 --> 02:42:11,404
A fake plane of tags was nine slash 11.
It's just bananas that someone would 

3617
02:42:14,581 --> 02:42:15,414
actually sit down and write by patriots 
six months before nine slash 11 trying 

3618
02:42:19,170 --> 02:42:20,230
to stop it.
Really?

3619
02:42:20,340 --> 02:42:22,200
And that's not saying Islamic terrorism 
real.

3620
02:42:22,201 --> 02:42:23,730
It's not saying bullshit.
Even did it.

3621
02:42:23,731 --> 02:42:24,564
Some super dark state group,
which Congress now has the 28 pages 

3622
02:42:28,291 --> 02:42:29,124
vindicating 9:11
druker's that Shoddy Arabia with people 

3623
02:42:31,231 --> 02:42:32,064
that they had gotten to convert to Islam
had paid off of their trillions and 

3624
02:42:35,100 --> 02:42:39,120
trillions had joined them in some larger
plan to blame,

3625
02:42:39,650 --> 02:42:40,483
uh,
Iraq and other countries that were non 

3626
02:42:42,431 --> 02:42:42,960
radical.

3627
02:42:42,960 --> 02:42:45,180
So Saudi Arabia,
you could take them over who,

3628
02:42:45,210 --> 02:42:46,043
who put together nine slash 11 shawnee 
Rabia of the Muslims either with 

3629
02:42:48,800 --> 02:42:49,633
anybody.
So they want to invade these other 

3630
02:42:50,660 --> 02:42:52,560
countries.
The adder to happen in the US.

3631
02:42:52,610 --> 02:42:54,450
I mean the US wasn't involved.
Of course.

3632
02:42:54,451 --> 02:42:55,284
What?
What are you saying?

3633
02:42:55,770 --> 02:42:58,440
Who was involved?
Who were the key players that nine slash

3634
02:42:58,441 --> 02:42:59,070
11.
It's.

3635
02:42:59,070 --> 02:42:59,903
It's totally compartmentalized.
So you run a drill of the World Trade 

3636
02:43:04,260 --> 02:43:05,880
Center and the Pentagon being attacked 
on that day.

3637
02:43:06,360 --> 02:43:09,050
So the planes are flying around.
Oh this is just a.

3638
02:43:09,270 --> 02:43:11,710
That was a drill that was supposed to be
run that day.

3639
02:43:11,800 --> 02:43:12,100
It all

3640
02:43:12,100 --> 02:43:17,080
came out a drill that was about it.
A false false flags.

3641
02:43:17,081 --> 02:43:17,831
I.
It seems like,

3642
02:43:17,831 --> 02:43:19,150
okay,
we're going to do a false flag.

3643
02:43:19,330 --> 02:43:22,570
We need to set up a drill.
They need a drill going on.

3644
02:43:23,350 --> 02:43:24,183
It's 99 point nine percent of the 
government wasn't involved because of 

3645
02:43:27,311 --> 02:43:28,660
computers.
It was a test.

3646
02:43:28,870 --> 02:43:32,680
They get a 100 times worse now no one 
will know because it's all remote.

3647
02:43:32,681 --> 02:43:35,740
Activated the jets by then.
We're all remote control.

3648
02:43:35,920 --> 02:43:36,753
Every jet for 25 years.
The big new ones has control morobe 

3649
02:43:39,520 --> 02:43:41,080
control.
It's all.

3650
02:43:41,081 --> 02:43:42,310
It's all.
It's crazy,

3651
02:43:42,311 --> 02:43:45,610
man.
There's jets now are unmanned.

3652
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:46,900
Absolutely.
Well,

3653
02:43:46,901 --> 02:43:47,860
no,
there man.

3654
02:43:47,890 --> 02:43:49,980
It's just thinking to go on autopilot.
Stupid.

3655
02:43:49,981 --> 02:43:52,540
Damn man.
If you think about it,

3656
02:43:52,570 --> 02:43:53,403
it's remote controlled dumb thing they 
said about the drone jetliners and they 

3657
02:43:57,401 --> 02:43:59,830
were going to blow up that jetliner and 
blame it on the Cubans.

3658
02:43:59,831 --> 02:44:01,690
That wasn't going to be a jetliner 
filled with people.

3659
02:44:01,690 --> 02:44:03,820
It's going to be a drone.
So they have the capability.

3660
02:44:03,821 --> 02:44:07,140
In 1962 of doing that,
which is how did,

3661
02:44:07,180 --> 02:44:09,050
how did,
how did Robert F Kennedy or JFK,

3662
02:44:09,080 --> 02:44:14,080
his older brother who was Joe Kennedy 
Junior die.

3663
02:44:14,680 --> 02:44:18,130
He was flying a fighter plane,
remote controlling to be 17.

3664
02:44:18,160 --> 02:44:21,160
Bloated with explosives as drones to 
crash into Germany.

3665
02:44:22,150 --> 02:44:25,390
They had drums in World War II.
Jesus Christ.

3666
02:44:25,870 --> 02:44:26,703
They had drones in World War II.
What would they powered by Google cave 

3667
02:44:30,250 --> 02:44:34,600
and how did Joe Kennedy Junior die?
He does secret mission over Germany.

3668
02:44:35,100 --> 02:44:36,930
My father.
No,

3669
02:44:37,270 --> 02:44:39,100
Joe Kennedy Junior.
Oh.

3670
02:44:39,310 --> 02:44:42,240
The crazy thing about the Kennedy's is,
is you know,

3671
02:44:42,241 --> 02:44:43,074
if you're.
A lot of times you see criminals come 

3672
02:44:44,981 --> 02:44:49,930
from like a good family and then you can
see Robert Kennedy and John F Kennedy.

3673
02:44:50,050 --> 02:44:52,810
They come from gangs to his dad is a 
gangster,

3674
02:44:52,900 --> 02:44:56,290
straight up mafia,
and then he has two kids.

3675
02:44:56,291 --> 02:44:59,650
They thought they had him under control 
because he's from a Mafia family.

3676
02:45:00,370 --> 02:45:04,060
Here's the.
Here's the guy's named Joe Kennedy.

3677
02:45:04,061 --> 02:45:06,400
Isn't that weird?
Because it's like you're the opposite of

3678
02:45:06,401 --> 02:45:07,234
your parents,
like you want to go against your 

3679
02:45:08,201 --> 02:45:11,860
parents.
So Robert Kennedy and John F Kennedy,

3680
02:45:12,100 --> 02:45:12,933
they went against that shit that that's 
the only reason they were in there 

3681
02:45:18,041 --> 02:45:21,440
because of the mob.
The mob supported Bob Stole Illinois for

3682
02:45:21,480 --> 02:45:26,080
and the mom supported John F Kennedy.
He was hanging out with Frank Sinatra.

3683
02:45:26,170 --> 02:45:28,240
Then all of a sudden he flipped and you 
know what?

3684
02:45:28,300 --> 02:45:30,550
He stopped hanging out with Frank 
Sinatra.

3685
02:45:30,820 --> 02:45:34,510
He started changing his ways.
Something flipped.

3686
02:45:34,690 --> 02:45:38,800
Did the did.
Did he have a kid that died or something

3687
02:45:38,801 --> 02:45:41,290
like that?
Is that something made him flip?

3688
02:45:41,590 --> 02:45:43,720
I thought I read something that could be
total bullshit,

3689
02:45:44,080 --> 02:45:46,900
but it could be that he had a son that 
died and made them flip.

3690
02:45:48,210 --> 02:45:50,200
Go to Joe Kennedy Jr.
Here.

3691
02:45:50,240 --> 02:45:50,890
He was.
Killed.

3692
02:45:50,890 --> 02:45:54,210
The guys that could make you think 
totally different when you're.

3693
02:45:54,520 --> 02:45:55,690
WHen you're a kid dies,
you're like,

3694
02:45:55,840 --> 02:45:59,560
fuck this.
I'm going with my soul.

3695
02:45:59,740 --> 02:46:00,880
Right?
You're like,

3696
02:46:00,881 --> 02:46:02,920
fuck this.
What could be worse?

3697
02:46:03,060 --> 02:46:04,910
Woke up.
My son already died.

3698
02:46:06,210 --> 02:46:07,043
I'm coming after you.
I'm coming after you liKe a fucking 

3699
02:46:09,700 --> 02:46:10,280
apache

3700
02:46:10,280 --> 02:46:11,113
savage with nothing to lose.
So Joe Kennedy jr was killed in action 

3701
02:46:15,531 --> 02:46:16,364
while serving as a land base patrol 
bomber pilot in world war ii and with 

3702
02:46:19,971 --> 02:46:24,410
posthumously awarded the navy cross,
Alex Jones throwing down.

3703
02:46:24,590 --> 02:46:28,490
Alex jusT doesn't doubt dude.
You're fucking.

3704
02:46:28,790 --> 02:46:31,770
You're on fire.
This was almost three hours of.

3705
02:46:31,880 --> 02:46:33,550
There's people out there.
There's nothing.

3706
02:46:35,230 --> 02:46:36,063
Don't just laying it down.
You're laying it down like game of 

3707
02:46:39,501 --> 02:46:42,380
motherfucking thrones.
Yes you are.

3708
02:46:42,770 --> 02:46:43,603
All I know is there's people in the 
government that want to empower people 

3709
02:46:46,910 --> 02:46:49,760
and they're trying to do a good job and 
I'm not anti government.

3710
02:46:49,761 --> 02:46:51,350
I want to have a good constitutional 
government.

3711
02:46:52,040 --> 02:46:52,873
And the truth is,
I couldn't believe when in my pd 

3712
02:46:54,861 --> 02:46:57,380
contacted me of the secret service.
The secret service came to me when I was

3713
02:46:57,381 --> 02:46:59,750
at the rnc.
So I'd like to number one passage.

3714
02:46:59,751 --> 02:47:01,910
Nobody had read passages.
I'd go behind the scenes.

3715
02:47:01,910 --> 02:47:03,800
Nobody stopped me,
but back in the back deal,

3716
02:47:04,620 --> 02:47:06,080
the secret service,
like in their ships,

3717
02:47:06,090 --> 02:47:07,550
go,
hey alex,

3718
02:47:07,551 --> 02:47:10,280
come here will tell you something about 
hillary.

3719
02:47:10,520 --> 02:47:11,353
Give us a contact number.
The next month we're going to contact 

3720
02:47:14,061 --> 02:47:16,250
you.
About a month later I get a contract.

3721
02:47:16,251 --> 02:47:17,051
They go,
can you come to it?

3722
02:47:17,051 --> 02:47:19,100
There's nothing digital.
He'd come down and meet at this place.

3723
02:47:19,310 --> 02:47:22,700
So I go down and meet,
meet one of other people as well.

3724
02:47:23,090 --> 02:47:24,230
Because where they were,
it was like they were hitting.

3725
02:47:24,231 --> 02:47:26,840
Both sides were operation and they said 
to me,

3726
02:47:27,020 --> 02:47:27,853
hillary has seizures.
Like every 30 minutes she's got an 

3727
02:47:30,201 --> 02:47:31,160
ambulance,
is black.

3728
02:47:31,161 --> 02:47:34,340
She falls down all the time,
just heavier people at her event.

3729
02:47:34,550 --> 02:47:36,410
He'll see her falling down.
She's covering it up.

3730
02:47:36,800 --> 02:47:38,030
Well sure enough,
a month,

3731
02:47:38,100 --> 02:47:40,370
an outside on air.
A month later she falls down in front of

3732
02:47:40,371 --> 02:47:41,204
the cameras.
We had footage wait before in cleveland 

3733
02:47:43,551 --> 02:47:44,630
again,
st louis,

3734
02:47:44,631 --> 02:47:46,160
she was back to,
oh,

3735
02:47:46,640 --> 02:47:49,190
it was a key battleground and she.

3736
02:47:49,490 --> 02:47:51,980
She was like for an hour in this 
emergency tent with,

3737
02:47:52,140 --> 02:47:55,250
with ambulances and stretchers,
so I'm telling you,

3738
02:47:55,251 --> 02:47:56,084
I mean I've got real sources that really
care about what's happening in this 

3739
02:47:58,851 --> 02:48:00,980
country and everything.
They told me it Was dead on.

3740
02:48:01,190 --> 02:48:02,870
You know,
what's scary about my government lakes.

3741
02:48:03,280 --> 02:48:04,113
Let's go.
Go back to the hillary thing was very 

3742
02:48:06,741 --> 02:48:07,574
bizarre because nobody was supposed to 
mention it like you weren't supposed to 

3743
02:48:09,531 --> 02:48:11,740
mention that she was fallen down.
Said,

3744
02:48:11,870 --> 02:48:16,310
we're like monya.
They said,

3745
02:48:16,311 --> 02:48:17,180
oh,
she had pneumonia.

3746
02:48:17,360 --> 02:48:18,830
Let me tell you something.
I've had pneumonia.

3747
02:48:18,980 --> 02:48:19,813
You know what I haven't done.
I haven't ever walked and just fallen 

3748
02:48:21,411 --> 02:48:24,680
down while I'm walking.
Really frayed as the background and then

3749
02:48:24,681 --> 02:48:29,480
comment on it because this is key.
It's known that in 2012 when she fell on

3750
02:48:29,481 --> 02:48:30,314
her head and she's got a severe 
concussion that was worrying for my 

3751
02:48:32,781 --> 02:48:33,441
sources,
but yeah,

3752
02:48:33,441 --> 02:48:34,550
she's in the hospital for a year.

3753
02:48:35,120 --> 02:48:36,420
Then she was.
Yeah,

3754
02:48:36,440 --> 02:48:39,610
she was fucked up for six whole months 
according to clinton to bill,

3755
02:48:39,840 --> 02:48:42,500
so she looks like hell,
we don't know where she is.

3756
02:48:43,040 --> 02:48:44,420
And then meanwhile I'm told,
hey,

3757
02:48:44,421 --> 02:48:47,450
she's falling down all the time.
She looks like hell on tv.

3758
02:48:47,900 --> 02:48:49,550
And then secret service says,
look,

3759
02:48:49,551 --> 02:48:52,460
you've got the people,
get up off your ass and follow her.

3760
02:48:52,760 --> 02:48:55,790
So we follow her in like five cities.
We didn't catch it.

3761
02:48:55,791 --> 02:48:57,890
We were in New York.
they sneak her out.

3762
02:48:57,891 --> 02:49:00,560
She falls down having epilepsy every 15,
20 minutes,

3763
02:49:00,561 --> 02:49:03,620
30 minutes.
The poInt is is my intel was good.

3764
02:49:03,950 --> 02:49:06,680
They gave us good info.
So what are the elite thinking?

3765
02:49:06,960 --> 02:49:07,980
They're going to put somebody in

3766
02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:09,120
with epilepsy.
That's all I'm saying.

3767
02:49:09,570 --> 02:49:13,050
But do you think that it was just the 
idea was she can hold it together.

3768
02:49:13,051 --> 02:49:15,260
Just anything rather than get as soon as
they.

3769
02:49:15,350 --> 02:49:17,100
If they just want her to get her 
through,

3770
02:49:17,130 --> 02:49:19,920
get all those girls like oh my god,
everything is great.

3771
02:49:20,040 --> 02:49:22,410
And then they pass all these 
motherfucking bills,

3772
02:49:22,740 --> 02:49:23,573
and it was,
it seemed to me that when all this was 

3773
02:49:25,351 --> 02:49:26,184
happening that people so desperately 
wanted to not look at it because the 

3774
02:49:29,221 --> 02:49:30,054
alternative was trump.
It wasn't that they were taking an 

3775
02:49:31,411 --> 02:49:32,730
objective look at it and go,
wow,

3776
02:49:33,090 --> 02:49:33,923
maybe she shouldn't be blacking out.
And then you consideR that massive head 

3777
02:49:36,841 --> 02:49:38,970
injury that she had in 2012,
which is real.

3778
02:49:38,971 --> 02:49:41,310
It's a fact.
You don't like it when you bring that up

3779
02:49:41,311 --> 02:49:43,080
though,
because they think if you bring that up,

3780
02:49:43,230 --> 02:49:45,820
you're going to change people's opinion 
and you're going to help trump win.

3781
02:49:47,580 --> 02:49:49,350
Can I just spend two minutes talking to 
your audience?

3782
02:49:49,351 --> 02:49:50,790
Which,
which camera is about trump.

3783
02:49:50,820 --> 02:49:51,653
That one,
just auto claim to have all the answers 

3784
02:49:55,710 --> 02:49:58,530
and I'm not here to boost Your trump 
because I'm tied to his wagon.

3785
02:49:58,720 --> 02:50:00,360
If I attack trump,
I'd make more money.

3786
02:50:00,600 --> 02:50:02,130
This isn't about money.
It's about the truth.

3787
02:50:03,300 --> 02:50:07,140
Trump really is trying to cut taxes and 
make people successful and wealthy.

3788
02:50:07,470 --> 02:50:09,340
He really does care about the average 
person.

3789
02:50:09,380 --> 02:50:12,870
The elite have set up a plan to slave 
people to make folks poor.

3790
02:50:13,290 --> 02:50:14,123
And all I'm asking you to do is get past
thinking that you're part of the 

3791
02:50:17,821 --> 02:50:20,280
establishment or you're smart because 
you're anti trump.

3792
02:50:20,490 --> 02:50:21,323
I'm asking you to actually look at 
what's really been going on and 

3793
02:50:24,391 --> 02:50:26,820
understand that democrats,
republicans come and go.

3794
02:50:26,821 --> 02:50:27,900
Some are good,
some are bad.

3795
02:50:28,290 --> 02:50:32,010
The whole power structure has been 
against trump for a very serious reason.

3796
02:50:32,490 --> 02:50:33,323
Trump is coming after them and really is
attempting to bring down this whole 

3797
02:50:36,571 --> 02:50:37,404
global system.
And that's where all hell's breaking 

3798
02:50:38,641 --> 02:50:39,474
loose.
So I just want your viewers and 

3799
02:50:39,781 --> 02:50:42,000
listeners know I'm not some political 
hack.

3800
02:50:42,001 --> 02:50:44,130
Like you said earlier,
I used to be against bush.

3801
02:50:44,550 --> 02:50:45,383
I Wish obama would have been real.
the point is they got to obama with 

3802
02:50:48,270 --> 02:50:49,890
trump.
He doesn't give a damn.

3803
02:50:50,040 --> 02:50:51,690
They admit they're offering money.
Everything.

3804
02:50:51,691 --> 02:50:52,524
He doesn't listen.
So you think what trump could or excuse 

3805
02:50:54,751 --> 02:50:55,584
me,
what obama could have been his who he 

3806
02:50:56,761 --> 02:50:57,594
was when he was running for office,
that he was this radical element of 

3807
02:50:59,941 --> 02:51:01,650
change,
hope and change.

3808
02:51:01,860 --> 02:51:04,680
He wanted to close down guantanamo bay.
He's wanting to do all these things.

3809
02:51:04,830 --> 02:51:09,830
But one of the posters in the back,
during his administration,

3810
02:51:10,771 --> 02:51:14,820
the dea decided to not take marijuana 
off the schedule.

3811
02:51:14,821 --> 02:51:17,460
One,
everybody knows it's not scheduled yet.

3812
02:51:17,480 --> 02:51:21,910
Was the cover for schedule one means no 
medical use.

3813
02:51:21,930 --> 02:51:24,970
He's start looking at the time it means 
that's what it means to be schedule one.

3814
02:51:24,980 --> 02:51:29,070
It's crazy that marijuana is schedule 
one when it's the most useful out of all

3815
02:51:29,071 --> 02:51:31,320
the different,
various illegal smart you are joe.

3816
02:51:31,321 --> 02:51:33,520
You smoke marijuana quite a bit and 
you're still smart guys.

3817
02:51:33,540 --> 02:51:36,340
Definitely not bad for just smelling it 
and I can't even think here.

3818
02:51:36,450 --> 02:51:38,610
I know you can't listen.
Let's get serious.

3819
02:51:39,310 --> 02:51:40,143
I'm telling you,
it's trump about what are those 

3820
02:51:41,941 --> 02:51:43,950
conversations about?
Let the people knoW.

3821
02:51:45,930 --> 02:51:48,870
I mean trump really wants to make poor 
people rich.

3822
02:51:49,320 --> 02:51:51,480
He really wants you to feed 
collectivism.

3823
02:51:51,990 --> 02:51:52,823
Collectivism.
He hates all the bashing the family and 

3824
02:51:55,560 --> 02:51:57,480
what's collected.
All the new world order.

3825
02:51:57,540 --> 02:52:00,540
Collectivism is this thing.
And like you're not an individual.

3826
02:52:00,541 --> 02:52:03,450
You're like part of a group.
And truMp can't stand that.

3827
02:52:03,451 --> 02:52:05,070
He can't stand.
Seeing as a businessman,

3828
02:52:05,530 --> 02:52:06,010
business

3829
02:52:06,010 --> 02:52:10,870
deals where China has like 35 percent 
currency tariffs on us.

3830
02:52:10,871 --> 02:52:11,704
There's no way he could even compete and
they're shutting off our power plants 

3831
02:52:14,111 --> 02:52:16,810
with regulations but not theirs.
Why do we do that then?

3832
02:52:16,820 --> 02:52:19,810
What is the reason why?
Because our elites under,

3833
02:52:19,811 --> 02:52:20,561
at,
quite frankly,

3834
02:52:20,561 --> 02:52:21,310
under,
under,

3835
02:52:21,310 --> 02:52:22,930
under kissinger and,
and,

3836
02:52:22,931 --> 02:52:24,010
and,
and of course,

3837
02:52:24,011 --> 02:52:25,200
uh,
uh,

3838
02:52:25,320 --> 02:52:26,153
you know,
the president who was in that 

3839
02:52:28,721 --> 02:52:30,760
administration,
nixon,

3840
02:52:31,150 --> 02:52:31,983
dave made a one sided deal for a leech 
to go make deals with China and their 

3841
02:52:34,421 --> 02:52:37,210
billion plus slaves.
I'll say that condescendingly,

3842
02:52:37,211 --> 02:52:39,670
they're like slaves to leverage out the 
west,

3843
02:52:39,671 --> 02:52:42,850
the whole world's industry and trump 
doesn't like those ones side of deals.

3844
02:52:42,851 --> 02:52:43,690
And he's saying,
listen,

3845
02:52:43,960 --> 02:52:47,200
we're not going to impoverish America,
we're going to empower America and we're

3846
02:52:47,201 --> 02:52:50,530
going to actually use american power to 
promote freedom worldwide.

3847
02:52:51,010 --> 02:52:53,160
So let me get this straight for guys 
like me that,

3848
02:52:53,240 --> 02:52:55,180
I mean,
all trump's does little promises.

3849
02:52:56,470 --> 02:52:59,680
So what you're saying is,
in layman's terms,

3850
02:53:01,230 --> 02:53:03,730
the elite,
the people in power,

3851
02:53:03,820 --> 02:53:07,030
the people that had the green light 
power to sign these treaties,

3852
02:53:07,300 --> 02:53:10,890
they were maybe offered a couple meal 
here,

3853
02:53:10,930 --> 02:53:15,490
couple meal there,
and sign this to sell the country out so

3854
02:53:15,491 --> 02:53:16,324
that they could make $10,000,005
billion thing like that is something 

3855
02:53:19,510 --> 02:53:20,343
that you asked,
got colonized by corporate takeover 

3856
02:53:22,061 --> 02:53:22,894
artists and trump at the end said f you.
So we're goIng to take their whole 

3857
02:53:25,751 --> 02:53:27,430
global system.
They built for nothing.

3858
02:53:27,450 --> 02:53:30,640
Take it away from them and have the true
new american millennium,

3859
02:53:30,880 --> 02:53:33,160
not the new century.
You listened to his.

3860
02:53:33,760 --> 02:53:36,790
I don't know if we got the time.
If you want to play this 18 minute share

3861
02:53:36,791 --> 02:53:38,240
to the union,
we could start or not.

3862
02:53:38,740 --> 02:53:41,560
Definitely not going to play that.
Fidel,

3863
02:53:41,680 --> 02:53:42,341
his,
his,

3864
02:53:42,341 --> 02:53:43,420
his,
his global,

3865
02:53:43,760 --> 02:53:45,280
uh,
inauguration speech.

3866
02:53:45,281 --> 02:53:48,010
He lays the whole beautiful bitch out.

3867
02:53:48,490 --> 02:53:49,323
And so if anybody ever wanted to 
actually have somebody trying to make 

3868
02:53:51,581 --> 02:53:54,400
them great and wealthy and powerful,
it's donald j.

3869
02:53:54,400 --> 02:53:56,170
Trump.
That's why the whole eat the whole power

3870
02:53:56,171 --> 02:53:57,100
structure,
hollywood,

3871
02:53:57,430 --> 02:53:59,860
all the pedophiles,
every damn demon,

3872
02:53:59,861 --> 02:54:02,050
every pot belly,
one inch fucker,

3873
02:54:02,460 --> 02:54:03,293
you know they are all against trump 
because he is pro human and he wants to 

3874
02:54:07,031 --> 02:54:09,910
dominate all these people.
It is an active alpha male.

3875
02:54:10,270 --> 02:54:12,820
He wants.
It's of the ego every now and then.

3876
02:54:12,850 --> 02:54:16,060
Every now and then we can help them run 
for office.

3877
02:54:16,250 --> 02:54:17,083
It.
He talks to you and he calls you are 

3878
02:54:19,561 --> 02:54:20,500
right.
I mean,

3879
02:54:20,950 --> 02:54:24,480
that's crazy.
He uses the other people.

3880
02:54:24,520 --> 02:54:25,450
You know,
people think,

3881
02:54:25,790 --> 02:54:29,320
I don't know Alex Jones.
They believe the mainstream media.

3882
02:54:29,380 --> 02:54:32,590
When they tried to crucify him and say 
he's at butler quack,

3883
02:54:32,591 --> 02:54:33,191
and he said,
well,

3884
02:54:33,191 --> 02:54:34,270
alex,
what you need?

3885
02:54:34,271 --> 02:54:35,830
Honestly,
if someone had temporary you,

3886
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:36,521
you,
you,

3887
02:54:36,521 --> 02:54:41,320
you need me right next to you All the 
time to balance powerful.

3888
02:54:41,321 --> 02:54:42,154
This is you being right there that 
you're like the fucking need to calm 

3889
02:54:46,181 --> 02:54:47,014
them down on your lap.
You got a bio suit on and you got to 

3890
02:54:51,251 --> 02:54:52,690
fucking ray gun.
You're like,

3891
02:54:52,691 --> 02:54:53,524
okay,
we need this alien to for to benefit 

3892
02:54:56,590 --> 02:54:57,423
humanity,
but I got to put this goddamn bio suit 

3893
02:54:59,830 --> 02:55:03,890
on because he's going crazy.
Just gotta kinda steer them

3894
02:55:04,010 --> 02:55:05,760
occasionally.
Just you get out,

3895
02:55:05,780 --> 02:55:06,613
you get on rants and you'll see you'll 
connect four or five different 

3896
02:55:10,580 --> 02:55:12,430
non-related subjects,
but that's,

3897
02:55:12,440 --> 02:55:13,370
that's.
It's beautiful.

3898
02:55:13,430 --> 02:55:18,430
It's not a bad guy that does.
Does that just go rent after rent,

3899
02:55:18,950 --> 02:55:21,080
after rent,
after rent with no teleprompters.

3900
02:55:21,320 --> 02:55:26,320
Only a guy that could do is right.
I'm actually very pleased that,

3901
02:55:28,130 --> 02:55:28,963
that joe has finished all my sentences 
and knows more than I do and it sits 

3902
02:55:31,551 --> 02:55:33,010
over there acting like he doesn't know 
all this.

3903
02:55:33,030 --> 02:55:35,210
I no,
no more than you can make them more than

3904
02:55:35,211 --> 02:55:37,610
you know,
just as much as every document,

3905
02:55:37,611 --> 02:55:40,010
every secret program.
He knew all about it,

3906
02:55:40,011 --> 02:55:42,140
you know,
it waSn't bullshitting the whole time.

3907
02:55:42,141 --> 02:55:43,500
You've been fucking.
You are building.

3908
02:55:43,600 --> 02:55:46,450
Listen mike,
hold on.

3909
02:55:46,760 --> 02:55:47,690
Cigarette about bill hicks.

3910
02:55:47,760 --> 02:55:52,110
He's a great comic.
Micro scopic,

3911
02:55:52,350 --> 02:55:53,183
bacterial penis atomic split.
The goddamn critical mass compared to 

3912
02:55:57,931 --> 02:56:00,000
Joe rogan.
I'm nothing.

3913
02:56:00,300 --> 02:56:01,133
I'm nothing and I've talKed so much shit
about conspiracy theories that I feel 

3914
02:56:05,881 --> 02:56:08,710
like I need to shut the fuck up because 
I don't.

3915
02:56:09,010 --> 02:56:14,010
I don't want any trouble asking 
questions of the universe.

3916
02:56:15,330 --> 02:56:16,163
It's questioning on your own,
the mystery and not Just receiving the 

3917
02:56:18,271 --> 02:56:19,800
priest class stuff.
Yes.

3918
02:56:20,440 --> 02:56:23,820
I'm not trying to.
I walked away from my podcast.

3919
02:56:23,940 --> 02:56:25,440
Nobody.
I thought nobody was listening,

3920
02:56:25,441 --> 02:56:27,020
but now people want me to go back.
I'm like,

3921
02:56:27,360 --> 02:56:28,590
I thought nobody,
but listen.

3922
02:56:28,620 --> 02:56:30,570
I don't want to be a conspiracy guy like
you.

3923
02:56:30,810 --> 02:56:31,643
I don't want to be that,
but I listened to you and you are my 

3924
02:56:34,441 --> 02:56:38,010
canary in the goddamn coma.
As long as you're alive,

3925
02:56:38,280 --> 02:56:40,890
I feel like I'm okay to say shit,
but I'll tell you this.

3926
02:56:40,980 --> 02:56:42,900
Every time I come to do the fight 
companion,

3927
02:56:43,020 --> 02:56:45,720
gi joe rogan experience,
I swear to god.

3928
02:56:45,900 --> 02:56:48,690
I tell myself this,
this fight companion,

3929
02:56:48,870 --> 02:56:52,500
no motherfucking conspiracy stairs.
let's just live live.

3930
02:56:52,650 --> 02:56:55,920
I called joke and I and I called him 
after a fight companions.

3931
02:56:55,940 --> 02:56:57,810
They go,
I can't believe I did it again,

3932
02:56:57,811 --> 02:56:58,980
joe.
I can't believe,

3933
02:56:59,190 --> 02:57:04,190
but suddenly something in me wants to 
help people.

3934
02:57:08,221 --> 02:57:11,430
For some reason and a lot of times my 
enemies like,

3935
02:57:11,431 --> 02:57:13,260
fuck them,
make a fucking,

3936
02:57:13,410 --> 02:57:14,520
you know what I mean?
Fuck them.

3937
02:57:14,610 --> 02:57:15,600
And I'm like,
damn,

3938
02:57:15,770 --> 02:57:19,560
if I just walk away because I'm 
compelled,

3939
02:57:19,890 --> 02:57:22,170
but I'm not trying to make money off 
conspiracy theories.

3940
02:57:22,320 --> 02:57:25,530
I gave have a conspiracy theory podcasts
right now and it would be okay,

3941
02:57:25,820 --> 02:57:28,470
but I'm not even trying to do that.
I don't want to do that.

3942
02:57:29,010 --> 02:57:30,840
I don't want to be that guy.
Don't want to be you,

3943
02:57:31,110 --> 02:57:31,943
but something inside me when the fucking
mic stand in someone's question and I'm 

3944
02:57:34,201 --> 02:57:35,034
like,
I got a son and I want to make sure did 

3945
02:57:37,891 --> 02:57:41,600
I fucking do everything I can for him 
because I don't want him.

3946
02:57:41,640 --> 02:57:44,580
I don't want to leave him with some shit
that I couldn't change.

3947
02:57:44,790 --> 02:57:47,790
So inside of me,
I'm like on the fence all the time.

3948
02:57:49,560 --> 02:57:51,270
Therefore,
when you're overzealous,

3949
02:57:52,120 --> 02:57:52,953
overzealous and you actually turn people
the wrong way and they look at any 

3950
02:57:55,741 --> 02:57:56,574
conspiracies is being proposed or even 
the ones that are real like sand dusky 

3951
02:57:59,221 --> 02:58:02,010
liked the catholic church like many 
other ones before.

3952
02:58:02,010 --> 02:58:03,480
There's a ton of them.
Liked hastert.

3953
02:58:03,481 --> 02:58:05,340
Who was the speaker of the fucking 
house?

3954
02:58:05,700 --> 02:58:08,430
Pedophile.
There's been a lot of frank,

3955
02:58:08,431 --> 02:58:11,490
so it's really critical,
but hold on a second.

3956
02:58:11,491 --> 02:58:12,390
Hold on a second,
eddie.

3957
02:58:12,540 --> 02:58:13,373
It's really critical Whenever you 
discussing any of these things and you 

3958
02:58:15,631 --> 02:58:19,080
get all the fucking ducks in order 
before you pick a side,

3959
02:58:19,290 --> 02:58:24,290
it's super important because anytime you
make some crazy claim and it's connected

3960
02:58:24,901 --> 02:58:27,060
to a conspiracy theory and it proves to 
be Wrong,

3961
02:58:27,360 --> 02:58:30,410
it fucks with all the ones that are not 
personally.

3962
02:58:30,420 --> 02:58:34,980
I'm all rIght.
People saying I'm bill hicks.

3963
02:58:35,310 --> 02:58:38,160
People show the others saying that.
It's like their eye hurts me.

3964
02:58:38,161 --> 02:58:40,630
They're that dumb that they don't know 
my own personality.

3965
02:58:40,690 --> 02:58:42,210
It's a joke.
It's a joke.

3966
02:58:42,211 --> 02:58:42,840
Me,
man,

3967
02:58:42,840 --> 02:58:43,680
it's on reddit.
Shit.

3968
02:58:43,710 --> 02:58:44,161
No,
I get it.

3969
02:58:44,161 --> 02:58:46,320
I get it.
It's unfortunate they're having fun,

3970
02:58:46,321 --> 02:58:47,790
but let's get to know.
Some of them are serious.

3971
02:58:47,810 --> 02:58:48,190
No.
Yeah,

3972
02:58:48,190 --> 02:58:49,023
but no.

3973
02:58:50,640 --> 02:58:52,470
Let me ask you something really quickly 
is very important.

3974
02:58:52,530 --> 02:58:54,930
Let me ask you a super important.
I feel like I was,

3975
02:58:54,931 --> 02:58:55,764
I was trying to say this earlier,
but we had to go back and finish up 

3976
02:58:57,580 --> 02:58:58,740
mouth,
but this is very important.

3977
02:58:59,370 --> 02:59:00,203
I,
uh,

3978
02:59:00,510 --> 02:59:03,060
I teach jujitsu.
I got students all over the world.

3979
02:59:03,061 --> 02:59:05,090
I got schools all over the world.
Um,

3980
02:59:05,360 --> 02:59:10,360
I have all my students.
I'm a west star tool to wake up,

3981
02:59:10,700 --> 02:59:12,360
you know,
that's like a metaphor.

3982
02:59:12,600 --> 02:59:15,870
I'm a conspiracy theory,
like at different times.

3983
02:59:15,940 --> 02:59:16,773
Some are just into me for jujitsu,
but they believed the cNn site 100 

3984
02:59:19,351 --> 02:59:20,184
percent,
it takes him three years and they're 

3985
02:59:21,121 --> 02:59:21,954
like,
oh shit.

3986
02:59:21,990 --> 02:59:24,240
They started smoking weed and damn there
all,

3987
02:59:24,270 --> 02:59:28,740
all over the conspiracy faCt,
everybody awakens at a different point.

3988
02:59:28,890 --> 02:59:30,470
No matter how smart they are,
you cAn,

3989
02:59:30,510 --> 02:59:32,610
you can get your master's,
your phd,

3990
02:59:32,730 --> 02:59:33,481
you could be,
oh,

3991
02:59:33,481 --> 02:59:34,314
I'm a scientist or whatever,
but you're working for the government 

3992
02:59:36,330 --> 02:59:38,070
and you ain't thinking about you.
But listen,

3993
02:59:38,160 --> 02:59:39,840
listen.
Do you think donald,

3994
02:59:39,870 --> 02:59:43,620
do you think Donald Trump is in the 
middle of an awakening,

3995
02:59:44,790 --> 02:59:47,910
awakening from a hundred percent real?
He's like,

3996
02:59:47,940 --> 02:59:49,710
is he in the middle of an awakening?
Yes,

3997
02:59:50,310 --> 02:59:54,870
because he could easily have been a 
billionaire tumor two years ago who,

3998
02:59:54,960 --> 02:59:57,570
who bought all the mainstream shit,
but he was a billionaire.

3999
02:59:57,571 --> 02:59:59,070
He didn't give a fuck about the 
mainstream shit.

4000
02:59:59,190 --> 03:00:03,600
He's cutting deals blowing up,
but now you know at a certain point,

4001
03:00:03,601 --> 03:00:05,670
no matter where you are,
no matter how smart you are,

4002
03:00:05,760 --> 03:00:08,930
you awaken a little,
little by little trump.

4003
03:00:09,680 --> 03:00:12,680
Donald trump knows which way the wind's 
going,

4004
03:00:13,120 --> 03:00:15,380
and as julius caesar in,
in,

4005
03:00:16,250 --> 03:00:19,760
in the famous play by william 
shakespeare of julius caesar,

4006
03:00:19,940 --> 03:00:22,130
there is a tide in the affairs of malmo 
taken at the flood,

4007
03:00:22,131 --> 03:00:24,440
leads onto fortune,
or as mark twain said,

4008
03:00:24,680 --> 03:00:27,500
in the beginning of patriots have scarce
man hated and feared scorn,

4009
03:00:27,720 --> 03:00:30,890
but a time when has caused exceeds it 
costs.

4010
03:00:30,920 --> 03:00:34,790
Nothing has Joined a patriot.
so here's what's happening right now.

4011
03:00:35,210 --> 03:00:36,043
There's a major shift happening and 
trump really wants to empower the 

4012
03:00:38,691 --> 03:00:41,150
people.
Globalism is anti human,

4013
03:00:42,020 --> 03:00:42,853
and so all I'm trying to get at is,
is that some really big things are 

4014
03:00:46,191 --> 03:00:47,024
happening in this world and people 
watching shouldn't be conservative or 

4015
03:00:50,301 --> 03:00:51,560
liberal.
CAn you stop?

4016
03:00:51,561 --> 03:00:52,840
Can I stop you for a moment?
What do you.

4017
03:00:52,850 --> 03:00:54,890
When you say globalism,
what do you mean by that?

4018
03:00:54,891 --> 03:00:58,760
Please define that.
Globalism is like neo colonialism,

4019
03:00:58,761 --> 03:01:02,980
but it's colonialism over humans,
individuals,

4020
03:01:02,981 --> 03:01:04,840
government states,
old world,

4021
03:01:04,841 --> 03:01:06,550
new world.
It's worldwide.

4022
03:01:06,551 --> 03:01:08,020
Colonialism,
rothchild,

4023
03:01:08,090 --> 03:01:08,923
but financially it's monopoly is the 
dominant populations and create 

4024
03:01:14,530 --> 03:01:18,100
centralized systems of monopolies in 
controlling wants to innovation.

4025
03:01:18,310 --> 03:01:22,240
It wants to end up where mobility,
globalism is.

4026
03:01:22,241 --> 03:01:24,610
Corporate world government.
Why do they want to stop innovation?

4027
03:01:27,400 --> 03:01:30,830
Because they see it as a bourbon.
They see it as what they call it,

4028
03:01:30,840 --> 03:01:33,490
disruptive technology and humanity.
So powerful.

4029
03:01:33,491 --> 03:01:34,324
You've already got a monopoly.
So is this a recent consideration after 

4030
03:01:36,161 --> 03:01:36,980
the unit?
It's been.

4031
03:01:36,980 --> 03:01:39,910
Internet has been in global is bigger 
than that,

4032
03:01:39,911 --> 03:01:41,710
but yes we are.
Part of that's true.

4033
03:01:41,860 --> 03:01:44,710
Since they've already got control,
they want competition to end.

4034
03:01:44,890 --> 03:01:46,990
They're in control.
They don't want challengers.

4035
03:01:47,200 --> 03:01:48,850
They've seized control of the human 
psyche,

4036
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:51,550
human development to the stars.
They've got it all.

4037
03:01:51,551 --> 03:01:53,680
I think they're getting rid of humanity 
and becoming gods.

4038
03:01:53,920 --> 03:01:55,840
Whatever dimension they're tuned into,
told them that.

4039
03:01:56,020 --> 03:01:59,170
So they want debates to end and they 
want authoritarianism.

4040
03:02:00,040 --> 03:02:01,450
They want to see what would happen 
there.

4041
03:02:01,760 --> 03:02:06,070
Bolt,
how is Donald Trump going to stop this?

4042
03:02:06,100 --> 03:02:07,350
A bulk came off the,
uh,

4043
03:02:07,550 --> 03:02:08,383
going crazy.
Cns making bolts come up and hoping it 

4044
03:02:10,811 --> 03:02:11,890
happens.
Alex,

4045
03:02:11,891 --> 03:02:15,640
how are you hoping they have to do with 
blocking?

4046
03:02:15,640 --> 03:02:19,390
Chances are energy siphons there 
vampiric actions of course,

4047
03:02:19,391 --> 03:02:20,224
so if he actually cuts taxes to poor 
people and middle class and gets rid of 

4048
03:02:22,961 --> 03:02:25,690
tax incentives for really rich,
he's not coming after the rich,

4049
03:02:25,691 --> 03:02:26,524
but from a conservative perspective that
republicans are cheering and so is that 

4050
03:02:29,561 --> 03:02:30,394
what he wants to do?
He wants to cut taxes for everybody 

4051
03:02:32,110 --> 03:02:33,300
except the rich.
He's gonna.

4052
03:02:33,320 --> 03:02:34,540
Encourage them.
Really?

4053
03:02:34,770 --> 03:02:35,603
Oh yeah.
That seems like the opposite of what a 

4054
03:02:36,401 --> 03:02:37,430
rich guy would do.
Right,

4055
03:02:37,840 --> 03:02:38,673
but he understands like Henry Ford did,
you got to sell a car where people can 

4056
03:02:42,791 --> 03:02:45,160
afford to buy it.
You got to pay your employees where they

4057
03:02:45,161 --> 03:02:47,350
can buy it.
He wants real prosperity.

4058
03:02:47,351 --> 03:02:49,420
He doesn't.
This is trying to get off in his.

4059
03:02:49,480 --> 03:02:52,570
In his limousine.
Robin by burnout old towns.

4060
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:55,210
Does is has been announced this tax 
plan.

4061
03:02:55,930 --> 03:02:57,490
Yeah.
So jamie,

4062
03:02:57,491 --> 03:02:58,600
see if he could pull up what it says.

4063
03:02:59,140 --> 03:02:59,973
that's fascinating.
I wonder if that will change people's 

4064
03:03:01,091 --> 03:03:01,924
opinions if that really does happen to 
people can save a significant amount of 

4065
03:03:04,331 --> 03:03:05,600
money in taxes.
The problem,

4066
03:03:06,040 --> 03:03:08,740
the globalist admit they want a global 
consolidation,

4067
03:03:09,010 --> 03:03:09,843
they want a global downturn to break.
Her buddies will and accept all the new 

4068
03:03:12,671 --> 03:03:15,850
taxes and regulations.
And so trump is racing.

4069
03:03:16,500 --> 03:03:18,700
Remember they had for eight years he 
represented interest,

4070
03:03:19,210 --> 03:03:20,043
but it was only the big banks.
Trump said we're going to keep zero 

4071
03:03:21,731 --> 03:03:23,890
percent for one year even though he's 
against it,

4072
03:03:24,070 --> 03:03:26,050
but for poor people to get zero percent 
interest.

4073
03:03:26,230 --> 03:03:27,580
Who cares?
It's all fee out anyways.

4074
03:03:27,730 --> 03:03:29,530
The banks lose the money.
It's all just write offs.

4075
03:03:30,130 --> 03:03:31,810
They're killing it all now.
And raising,

4076
03:03:31,811 --> 03:03:32,644
raising taxes,
trump tax reform that will make America 

4077
03:03:34,811 --> 03:03:36,520
great again.
The goals of Donald Trump,

4078
03:03:36,521 --> 03:03:39,670
number one tax relief for middle class 
America in order to achieve the american

4079
03:03:39,671 --> 03:03:44,560
dream that people keep more money in 
their pockets and increase the after tax

4080
03:03:44,580 --> 03:03:45,700
wages.
Number two,

4081
03:03:46,050 --> 03:03:46,883
uh,
simplify the tax code to reduce 

4082
03:03:48,461 --> 03:03:49,294
headaches.
Americans face in preparing their taxes 

4083
03:03:51,641 --> 03:03:54,040
and let everYone keep more of their 
money.

4084
03:03:54,250 --> 03:03:55,900
So he's traveled.
Plan,

4085
03:03:55,901 --> 03:03:58,000
he's already implemented it though.
14

4086
03:03:58,030 --> 03:03:59,990
or 12 days in,
we've already got.

4087
03:03:59,991 --> 03:04:00,824
He's doing.
So if you're single and you earn less 

4088
03:04:02,751 --> 03:04:03,584
than $25,000
or married and jointly earned less than 

4089
03:04:06,231 --> 03:04:10,940
$50,000,
you will not owe any income tax shit.

4090
03:04:11,660 --> 03:04:13,600
Holy shit.
The taxes on portable,

4091
03:04:13,640 --> 03:04:14,473
that removes nearly 75 million 
households all over 50 percent of the 

4092
03:04:17,871 --> 03:04:19,540
income tax roles.
Other posts,

4093
03:04:19,630 --> 03:04:23,360
they get a new one page form to send to 
the irs saying,

4094
03:04:23,361 --> 03:04:27,200
I win those who would otherwise.
Oh,

4095
03:04:27,230 --> 03:04:28,063
how crazy is that?
They get to save a new one page form to 

4096
03:04:31,311 --> 03:04:35,510
send to the irs saying,
I win those.

4097
03:04:35,660 --> 03:04:36,493
Those who would otherwise a owe income 
tax will save an average of nearly 

4098
03:04:41,001 --> 03:04:42,620
$1,000
each.

4099
03:04:42,980 --> 03:04:43,761
Yeah,
it's not that big.

4100
03:04:43,761 --> 03:04:45,740
If you're the lowest bracket that pays 
taxes,

4101
03:04:45,980 --> 03:04:49,180
you basically don't pay taxes.
You don't want people to pay in.

4102
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:52,280
Taxes are for rich people.
Rich,

4103
03:04:52,281 --> 03:04:55,280
you pay big tips.
You get it like these people need money.

4104
03:04:55,280 --> 03:04:56,113
But look at this statement.
No business of any size from a fortune 

4105
03:04:58,701 --> 03:04:59,534
500 to a mom and pop shop to a 
freelancer living job to job will pay 

4106
03:05:04,461 --> 03:05:08,380
more than 15 percent of their business 
income in taxes.

4107
03:05:08,390 --> 03:05:09,223
That's just plan this lower rate makes 
corporate investments inversions 

4108
03:05:12,710 --> 03:05:16,400
unnecessary by making america's tax rate
one of the best in the world.

4109
03:05:16,760 --> 03:05:18,980
Holy shit.
We have one of the highest rates,

4110
03:05:19,160 --> 03:05:19,993
so nobody wants to be here.
No family will have To pay the death 

4111
03:05:22,611 --> 03:05:24,230
tax.
Holy shit.

4112
03:05:24,740 --> 03:05:29,740
You know about this deliver man that 
trump is for real.

4113
03:05:30,020 --> 03:05:32,390
He's totally.
You earned and saved that money for your

4114
03:05:32,391 --> 03:05:36,410
family and not the government.
You paid taxes on it when you earned it.

4115
03:05:36,620 --> 03:05:37,453
That is so buick immigrants.
His athletic applicant is a beautiful 

4116
03:05:39,980 --> 03:05:42,320
tax plan.
That death tax is disgusting.

4117
03:05:42,530 --> 03:05:45,740
So like if you left money for your kid,
they would take half your money.

4118
03:05:46,280 --> 03:05:47,113
They take some dumb giant chunk of it 
and he's saying that's not gonna happen 

4119
03:05:50,241 --> 03:05:51,470
anymore.
That alone,

4120
03:05:51,920 --> 03:05:54,230
that's a beautiful thing.
That's a very good thing.

4121
03:05:54,231 --> 03:05:59,231
So trump has painted this painting land 
70 of them and like they're like pushing

4122
03:06:02,301 --> 03:06:04,240
by families with kids like carrie,
carrie,

4123
03:06:04,290 --> 03:06:05,600
carrie,
like yelling at families.

4124
03:06:05,601 --> 03:06:06,434
Just want going forward.
They like literally pushed by like 

4125
03:06:08,330 --> 03:06:12,020
hispanic families and black people 
screaming kkk.

4126
03:06:12,370 --> 03:06:15,890
And I looked at him on tape or just 
going like what feels good for people to

4127
03:06:15,891 --> 03:06:16,724
have a clear enemy and if they can 
justify in their mind you're a white 

4128
03:06:19,521 --> 03:06:24,521
supremacist or anybody on the alt right 
is a racist or twelfth kkk.

4129
03:06:25,130 --> 03:06:30,130
And I heard he's a rapist.
Everyone's marching on the streets.

4130
03:06:33,100 --> 03:06:33,890
That's what.
Well,

4131
03:06:33,890 --> 03:06:34,723
there's also a bunch of people that are 
looking for some sort of solidarity 

4132
03:06:38,310 --> 03:06:39,770
pumped.
Maybe they were.

4133
03:06:39,771 --> 03:06:43,400
Maybe They thought that hillary was a 
better choice and maybe they got excited

4134
03:06:43,401 --> 03:06:47,090
that they could get together and join up
and walk the streets.

4135
03:06:47,840 --> 03:06:52,840
Anytime you can get people to get 
together for a common good in their mind

4136
03:06:53,061 --> 03:06:55,220
at least.
And no one gets arrested,

4137
03:06:55,410 --> 03:06:56,243
that's a good thing.

4138
03:06:57,290 --> 03:06:59,850
Probably no traffic for a lot of people 
and made it annoying.

4139
03:06:59,910 --> 03:07:00,743
What would you do if like almost half 
the time you go out to eat or in a 

4140
03:07:03,151 --> 03:07:03,984
grocery store,
someone slaps you in the back and 

4141
03:07:05,150 --> 03:07:06,420
telling me that happens to you.
Right?

4142
03:07:06,870 --> 03:07:10,200
Well I wonDer where it's like they're 
interdimensionally connected.

4143
03:07:10,201 --> 03:07:12,690
Like why is it always boom,
you're a loser.

4144
03:07:12,750 --> 03:07:14,610
Slap you in the face of the back of the 
head.

4145
03:07:14,930 --> 03:07:15,763
It's like,
how are they so with that was the 

4146
03:07:18,961 --> 03:07:20,640
greatest thing you've ever said.
No,

4147
03:07:20,641 --> 03:07:23,610
I'm serious.
He just didn't fight it.

4148
03:07:23,611 --> 03:07:24,444
A door for people going who you're a 
loser and then try to slap you in the 

4149
03:07:26,521 --> 03:07:29,200
back of the head.
It's going to happen again.

4150
03:07:29,660 --> 03:07:32,580
You started to human meme care.
The point is,

4151
03:07:32,910 --> 03:07:34,160
how are they so sync?
Okay,

4152
03:07:34,161 --> 03:07:35,040
here's the deal.
Well,

4153
03:07:35,070 --> 03:07:38,040
You have women going,
allah akbar,

4154
03:07:38,340 --> 03:07:42,030
why love god by the media,
by the media,

4155
03:07:42,031 --> 03:07:44,720
and I'm out there peacefully videotaping
him.

4156
03:07:44,720 --> 03:07:48,390
The saturday after trump's inauguration 
in dc before I leave and they're like,

4157
03:07:48,410 --> 03:07:50,460
eff you white male.
They're all white women.

4158
03:07:51,580 --> 03:07:55,950
I'm all out and they put hats on.
They burke is screaming,

4159
03:07:55,980 --> 03:07:58,440
I'm going to join jihad.
You'll never stop me.

4160
03:07:58,441 --> 03:07:59,274
I'm like,
I'm not going to cut your genitals 

4161
03:08:00,361 --> 03:08:02,040
often.
Put you on a slave block.

4162
03:08:02,340 --> 03:08:03,173
I don't get where.
I've never done anything to women and 

4163
03:08:05,371 --> 03:08:09,120
all these weird ass women include the dc
police were letting people attack us.

4164
03:08:09,121 --> 03:08:12,360
They were wearing these pink hats and 
then they get attacked.

4165
03:08:12,390 --> 03:08:13,260
Praising.
Yeah.

4166
03:08:13,390 --> 03:08:15,660
Somebody was saying that you were drunk.
That's not true,

4167
03:08:15,661 --> 03:08:17,190
right?
Absolutely not.

4168
03:08:17,250 --> 03:08:18,480
I didn't think so.
No,

4169
03:08:18,510 --> 03:08:19,500
no.
The truth is,

4170
03:08:20,310 --> 03:08:24,690
the headline was Alex Jones kicked out 
of inauguration.

4171
03:08:25,970 --> 03:08:29,370
They have people blocking the hindrances
because they had it all fenced off.

4172
03:08:29,371 --> 03:08:30,990
You could get in.
Yeah,

4173
03:08:30,991 --> 03:08:32,010
it was.
The whole thing is,

4174
03:08:32,210 --> 03:08:33,270
it's,
it's very,

4175
03:08:33,271 --> 03:08:35,580
uh,
the whole movement is very aggressive.

4176
03:08:36,000 --> 03:08:36,833
You know,
it's like a response to what they think 

4177
03:08:38,191 --> 03:08:40,470
is a aggressive,
you know,

4178
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:42,720
you're all over.
They're slick asking questions.

4179
03:08:43,020 --> 03:08:44,310
Mr john,
we have heard.

4180
03:08:44,311 --> 03:08:45,144
Let's be serious.
What is your real worldview or the 

4181
03:08:47,641 --> 03:08:51,000
nature of consciousness on this planet 
and intergalactic space?

4182
03:08:51,600 --> 03:08:54,540
I've been a been a really honest today 
and a lot of true answers.

4183
03:08:54,870 --> 03:08:57,180
So metaphysically,
what is the secret of the universe?

4184
03:08:57,210 --> 03:08:58,043
This is what I think there was a little,
a organism that was just recently 

4185
03:09:01,261 --> 03:09:02,010
discussed.

4186
03:09:02,010 --> 03:09:03,390
We did it,
I think yesterday,

4187
03:09:03,690 --> 03:09:04,523
and they think it was one of the very 
first organisms that was the precursor 

4188
03:09:08,070 --> 03:09:12,390
to what we eventually became.
And then all biological life,

4189
03:09:12,391 --> 03:09:13,224
all like living,
walking things came out of this one 

4190
03:09:15,840 --> 03:09:17,500
multicell organism,
right?

4191
03:09:18,030 --> 03:09:21,600
Yeah.
So one thing I think as that happened,

4192
03:09:21,630 --> 03:09:23,400
whatever hundreds of millions of Years 
ago,

4193
03:09:23,401 --> 03:09:25,770
I don't know what the number is,
but whatever,

4194
03:09:26,250 --> 03:09:28,860
however long,
billions of years that happened to go,

4195
03:09:29,280 --> 03:09:32,820
if we keep going in that same direction,
whatever we are now,

4196
03:09:33,080 --> 03:09:33,913
which is going to be totally 
unrecognizable just a few hundred years 

4197
03:09:36,781 --> 03:09:38,430
from now or a few thousand years from 
now,

4198
03:09:38,431 --> 03:09:42,360
or if we just do it biologically a 
million years from now,

4199
03:09:42,480 --> 03:09:46,950
but I think that if human beings managed
stay alive for a long period of time and

4200
03:09:46,951 --> 03:09:51,030
not blow each other up,
we're on the cusp of figuring out how to

4201
03:09:51,031 --> 03:09:55,450
manipulate our very beings like to the 
point where we're not going to be people

4202
03:09:55,451 --> 03:09:56,110
anymore.

4203
03:09:56,110 --> 03:09:57,760
It's just going to chAnge.
That's it.

4204
03:09:57,810 --> 03:10:00,370
Yeah.
Humanity is at the crossroads and that's

4205
03:10:00,371 --> 03:10:01,204
my message today.
The elite have decided they think the 

4206
03:10:03,701 --> 03:10:06,310
course of our evolutIon,
I'm here to say,

4207
03:10:07,180 --> 03:10:09,190
shouldn't we decided to have a debate 
about it?

4208
03:10:09,220 --> 03:10:09,711
Well,
I don't have.

4209
03:10:09,711 --> 03:10:13,330
Some of the experiences is a great place
for the people have this insatiable need

4210
03:10:13,331 --> 03:10:15,340
for innovation.
They're fascinated by it.

4211
03:10:15,341 --> 03:10:17,590
They want the newest phone,
even though their phone works perfect.

4212
03:10:17,620 --> 03:10:19,400
Is that they just want it.
They have this desire.

4213
03:10:19,401 --> 03:10:20,234
It's a weird thing.
It's just like we were talking about 

4214
03:10:21,551 --> 03:10:23,800
like these,
these things aren't designed to make you

4215
03:10:23,801 --> 03:10:25,370
addicted to them.
You're just addicted to them.

4216
03:10:25,400 --> 03:10:26,233
They're designed well.
There's a weird sort of connection that 

4217
03:10:28,271 --> 03:10:29,104
we have to this technology and I think 
it's because of what marshall mcluhan 

4218
03:10:32,111 --> 03:10:32,944
said before.
I think it's because of what marshall 

4219
03:10:34,361 --> 03:10:37,540
mcluhan said that human beings are the 
sex organs and the machine world.

4220
03:10:37,540 --> 03:10:39,580
I really think that's what they're 
doing.

4221
03:10:39,730 --> 03:10:40,563
I think all of this integration and all 
this innovation of all this kind of the 

4222
03:10:42,731 --> 03:10:43,564
primary prevailing does compelling focus
on technology is because evolutionarily 

4223
03:10:48,521 --> 03:10:49,354
that's where our biology goes.
It goes to technology because it can 

4224
03:10:52,721 --> 03:10:56,620
manipulate it at a far faster rate.
Our evolution,

4225
03:10:56,621 --> 03:10:57,454
and I hear what you're saying,
biomechanically genetically through 

4226
03:11:01,330 --> 03:11:04,080
round cells,
not square silicon.

4227
03:11:04,090 --> 03:11:07,630
We do it more beautifully and strongly.
I agree with what you're saying.

4228
03:11:07,631 --> 03:11:09,490
Overall,
I don't think it's an either or.

4229
03:11:09,491 --> 03:11:11,700
Alice shouldn't just expect alex.
I don't think it's either.

4230
03:11:11,820 --> 03:11:12,653
Just accept it.
They're going to be able to do shit in 

4231
03:11:14,711 --> 03:11:15,544
both ways,
whether it's integrating combinators 

4232
03:11:18,350 --> 03:11:19,181
longer,
I'm going to do it.

4233
03:11:19,181 --> 03:11:22,660
It's going to happen.
The point is going to be screaming for a

4234
03:11:22,660 --> 03:11:24,250
hundred years from the public needs to 
know this.

4235
03:11:24,430 --> 03:11:26,800
Yeah,
so I think the larger debate about it,

4236
03:11:26,950 --> 03:11:27,650
well they do.

4237
03:11:27,650 --> 03:11:28,483
They are learning about it.
It's just something that you have to 

4238
03:11:29,651 --> 03:11:32,770
seek out and it's really all the 
information is control.

4239
03:11:32,780 --> 03:11:33,613
I don't know about that.
The information about is about 

4240
03:11:35,021 --> 03:11:37,820
innovation and and artificial 
intelligence to up.

4241
03:11:38,240 --> 03:11:40,510
They're letting a lot out of this 
constant study.

4242
03:11:40,511 --> 03:11:43,660
If you were tony fucking Montana running
the planet,

4243
03:11:43,900 --> 03:11:45,870
would you let that shit out of what you 
keep it for you,

4244
03:11:46,090 --> 03:11:46,923
but eddie,
there's not.

4245
03:11:46,990 --> 03:11:50,470
Tony Montana is not running science.
The thing is these scientists are almost

4246
03:11:50,471 --> 03:11:53,320
all involved in universities and 
different studies and they worked on the

4247
03:11:53,321 --> 03:11:54,970
phds and trying to make a name for 
themselves.

4248
03:11:55,150 --> 03:11:55,983
They're exploring all these different 
possibilities and then big companies 

4249
03:11:58,751 --> 03:11:59,584
that can profit off of it and billions 
and billions of dollars like sony or 

4250
03:12:02,021 --> 03:12:05,480
apple or any of these other companies,
these people up and they're fucking.

4251
03:12:05,770 --> 03:12:08,500
Hold on a second there thing is to 
innovate and make money.

4252
03:12:08,560 --> 03:12:09,393
That's what they're there for.
That's what they do in the envelope and 

4253
03:12:11,490 --> 03:12:13,270
technology,
but they're not.

4254
03:12:13,271 --> 03:12:14,980
Tony Montana.
do you understand this?

4255
03:12:14,981 --> 03:12:16,060
You're talking about two different 
things.

4256
03:12:16,830 --> 03:12:19,310
You're talking about some utopia?
No,

4257
03:12:19,330 --> 03:12:20,163
no.
Talking about what it's trying to to 

4258
03:12:22,451 --> 03:12:25,820
benefit the point.
Talking about what intel.

4259
03:12:25,850 --> 03:12:28,990
Here's people who makes iphone,
doesn't matter.

4260
03:12:29,380 --> 03:12:30,213
We're having a real discussion about the
future of the technological system of 

4261
03:12:33,641 --> 03:12:35,710
humanity.
They don't want that discussion.

4262
03:12:35,890 --> 03:12:40,300
She'll this things that whether it's joe
or Alex Jones or eddie bravo,

4263
03:12:40,480 --> 03:12:41,313
we're all having on the joe rogan 
experience a dIscussion the elite are 

4264
03:12:44,261 --> 03:12:48,010
having right now in Hawaii right now 
with zuckerberg.

4265
03:12:48,250 --> 03:12:51,010
I know for a fact the elites are meeting
with zuckerberg in

4266
03:12:52,280 --> 03:12:53,113
facebook to alkali,
but the whole point is they're having 

4267
03:12:55,780 --> 03:12:56,613
this meeting.
He owns facebook now and we should 

4268
03:12:57,861 --> 03:13:01,640
discuss what's happening.
Is facebook part of the illuminati now?

4269
03:13:01,641 --> 03:13:04,250
You know he's a bear shit in the woods 
part of it.

4270
03:13:04,400 --> 03:13:05,233
Come on,
aren't you?

4271
03:13:05,650 --> 03:13:10,650
Look at alex that that profile.
I know you do.

4272
03:13:13,060 --> 03:13:14,540
I know you folks off.
I know you do.

4273
03:13:14,580 --> 03:13:15,413
Hey,
the big issues of the world is he never 

4274
03:13:16,491 --> 03:13:18,770
asked me about ronald reagan.
I want to know about aliens.

4275
03:13:21,490 --> 03:13:22,323
I keep coming back to that because I 
want to know what do they know about 

4276
03:13:25,611 --> 03:13:26,600
aliens?
What are you wearing?

4277
03:13:26,990 --> 03:13:28,820
What are they real?
Okay.

4278
03:13:28,821 --> 03:13:33,821
I'll tell you right now,
and what I say is not political and it's

4279
03:13:34,160 --> 03:13:34,993
not from my particular perspective,
from the known knowledge in the 

4280
03:13:38,241 --> 03:13:41,930
universe.
We live in a third dimensional plane.

4281
03:13:42,650 --> 03:13:44,630
We can see the planets and the galaxies.

4282
03:13:44,630 --> 03:13:47,720
The sun's hundreds of billions of 
galaxies,

4283
03:13:47,721 --> 03:13:51,650
photographed universes.
We live in an amazing space.

4284
03:13:51,651 --> 03:13:52,484
Time continuum.
The elites believe that it's not in the 

4285
03:13:56,421 --> 03:13:59,240
third dimension that we're mainly 
receiving transmissions.

4286
03:14:00,050 --> 03:14:00,883
Ships don't arrive from elvis and 
tourists or gt prime for wherever 

4287
03:14:04,941 --> 03:14:08,090
they're coming from or meal.
Jeez.

4288
03:14:09,290 --> 03:14:10,123
They come here to inter interdimensional
gates that are much closer through fold 

4289
03:14:14,031 --> 03:14:14,864
space,
and so we have to discuss the different 

4290
03:14:18,410 --> 03:14:22,300
influences there in the universe and on 
fact that we have freewill and we decide

4291
03:14:22,310 --> 03:14:24,530
what we want.
I don't believe in any of this.

4292
03:14:25,130 --> 03:14:27,350
I'm simply telling you what the elites 
believe.

4293
03:14:27,380 --> 03:14:28,213
So they believed thAt there's another 
dimension and these beings are 

4294
03:14:30,570 --> 03:14:33,740
mentioned.
They need baby blood,

4295
03:14:33,741 --> 03:14:34,760
right?
They need something.

4296
03:14:34,930 --> 03:14:37,790
They need to tune in.
Let me tell you,

4297
03:14:38,200 --> 03:14:39,560
oh,
we're really powerful.

4298
03:14:41,040 --> 03:14:41,873
Were made the image of our creator.
Our brain is able to tune into the 

4299
03:14:44,391 --> 03:14:46,120
lowest dimension,
the hIghest.

4300
03:14:46,120 --> 03:14:46,953
At mentioned,
humans are basically really powerful 

4301
03:14:48,951 --> 03:14:52,760
creatures that can live right close to 
sons that are highly radioactive.

4302
03:14:52,770 --> 03:14:53,603
nothing else can live as close with very
short lives because we're like a hive 

4303
03:14:57,801 --> 03:15:01,460
organism that actually lives second to 
second in the space time continuum.

4304
03:15:01,461 --> 03:15:02,900
She's like 100 years,
it's a second,

4305
03:15:03,170 --> 03:15:04,003
and we transmit our data up to be able 
to live next to likely stargate jump 

4306
03:15:07,441 --> 03:15:08,900
gates that are,
that are sons.

4307
03:15:09,320 --> 03:15:11,720
So because we live so close to these 
sons,

4308
03:15:12,080 --> 03:15:12,913
we only have milliseconds to be alive,
so we're actually a hive organism that 

4309
03:15:16,561 --> 03:15:20,300
keeps transmitting up to the next 
species in our,

4310
03:15:20,301 --> 03:15:21,920
in our,
in a hierarchical system,

4311
03:15:22,070 --> 03:15:22,903
and then down below us.
So we're alive right now in this 

4312
03:15:25,551 --> 03:15:28,630
continuum and we're trying to progress 
and,

4313
03:15:28,660 --> 03:15:30,260
and,
and make things better.

4314
03:15:30,740 --> 03:15:34,580
And the elites are trying to make sure 
that we don't doubt into that incredible

4315
03:15:34,581 --> 03:15:35,414
knowledge we've got as a species.
It basically dies a species so that 

4316
03:15:39,310 --> 03:15:40,143
we're not competitors on the next level 
as the bible says of their dimensional 

4317
03:15:44,121 --> 03:15:47,960
plane.
But you don't believe that.

4318
03:15:47,961 --> 03:15:49,890
You're just saying that's what they.
Oh yes,

4319
03:15:49,950 --> 03:15:50,430
exactly.

4320
03:15:50,430 --> 03:15:52,220
I'm not calculating anything.
What do you believe?

4321
03:15:52,410 --> 03:15:53,190
No,
I mean,

4322
03:15:53,190 --> 03:15:54,023
I believe in research.
do you think that I believe in research 

4323
03:15:56,011 --> 03:15:56,844
to.
Do you think that there is something 

4324
03:15:57,781 --> 03:15:59,940
from other dimensions that can access 
us?

4325
03:16:00,490 --> 03:16:01,110
Uh,
this,

4326
03:16:01,110 --> 03:16:02,880
this,
we are other dimensions.

4327
03:16:03,390 --> 03:16:07,590
The third dimension is only one limited 
plane in a larger spectrum.

4328
03:16:08,710 --> 03:16:10,170
Part of that spectrum.
Well,

4329
03:16:10,171 --> 03:16:12,060
let's just say we're not in Kansas 
anymore.

4330
03:16:12,480 --> 03:16:13,830
Alex.
Have you ever done dmt?

4331
03:16:13,890 --> 03:16:15,300
No.
Do you want to.

4332
03:16:16,200 --> 03:16:18,360
I don't need to go to every night I go 
to sleep.

4333
03:16:18,660 --> 03:16:21,930
I believe that he's done.
It's like he's on natural dmt.

4334
03:16:22,020 --> 03:16:23,730
Definitely on something man.
For sure.

4335
03:16:23,930 --> 03:16:25,100
And I got a question for you.

4336
03:16:28,080 --> 03:16:28,913
You know how this is,
this is kind of off the cuff a little 

4337
03:16:30,691 --> 03:16:33,510
bit off track,
off the beaten path,

4338
03:16:33,720 --> 03:16:34,553
but you know how the cia has always been
involved in hollywood and make movies 

4339
03:16:37,171 --> 03:16:39,150
and you know,
like zero dark 30 and you know,

4340
03:16:39,151 --> 03:16:42,570
all of these movies that are clearly 
propaganda movies,

4341
03:16:42,571 --> 03:16:43,670
you know what I mean?
Hold on.

4342
03:16:43,790 --> 03:16:46,020
MosT like even movies you think they 
weren't propaganda,

4343
03:16:46,021 --> 03:16:48,030
but they are.
They like the superhero movies.

4344
03:16:48,031 --> 03:16:49,920
How they're just all the plots and the 
evil.

4345
03:16:49,980 --> 03:16:52,820
Oh they're going to build a bomb and all
that is.

4346
03:16:53,190 --> 03:16:58,050
Is there whistleblowers within hollywood
that are making movies?

4347
03:16:58,051 --> 03:17:01,560
Just like in Brazil it was a martial 
arts were outlawed.

4348
03:17:01,710 --> 03:17:04,140
So the people,
the people that were about the truth,

4349
03:17:04,290 --> 03:17:07,350
they were like doing dance,
but they were disguising them.

4350
03:17:07,351 --> 03:17:09,950
Our clients.
Is there a filmmaker?

4351
03:17:10,020 --> 03:17:10,853
Are.
They're filmmakers like that out there 

4352
03:17:11,821 --> 03:17:12,654
that are trying to help humanity with 
the basis of their films or is it all 

4353
03:17:16,020 --> 03:17:17,970
perfectly?
It was like anything else.

4354
03:17:18,000 --> 03:17:21,420
There's good people and bad people and I
don't think hollywood overall is bad.

4355
03:17:21,421 --> 03:17:23,040
Which,
which movies are the good ones.

4356
03:17:23,041 --> 03:17:25,560
Tell him because I watched star wars.
I'm like,

4357
03:17:25,680 --> 03:17:28,010
is this the bad one?
That's propaganda.

4358
03:17:29,620 --> 03:17:32,430
Street movies are good ones.
The good ones.

4359
03:17:33,210 --> 03:17:37,680
which ones are the ones I should go 
deacon nights.

4360
03:17:40,310 --> 03:17:43,410
what about like when a hangover one 
comes out,

4361
03:17:43,440 --> 03:17:44,273
let me tell you.
That's not because anybody that didn't 

4362
03:17:48,870 --> 03:17:50,170
like hangoveR.
Go ahead.

4363
03:17:50,390 --> 03:17:54,720
I'm oNly the name of like one part of 
the shadow government,

4364
03:17:55,140 --> 03:17:57,030
whiCh is all the intellectuals of 
America.

4365
03:17:57,420 --> 03:18:00,100
So those people are on trump's sIde now.
Yeah,

4366
03:18:00,680 --> 03:18:03,720
and that's the first time ever.
Well,

4367
03:18:03,780 --> 03:18:06,660
the cia has never been perfect,
so they must've been with bush,

4368
03:18:06,661 --> 03:18:08,350
right?
Because bush used to be the presidency.

4369
03:18:08,351 --> 03:18:13,110
I senior george herbert walker,
so he was head of the cia.

4370
03:18:13,180 --> 03:18:17,670
Here's the deal.
The cia was shut up supposedly to defend

4371
03:18:17,671 --> 03:18:18,504
the republic and do all this stuff.
It got hijacked by multinational 

4372
03:18:21,181 --> 03:18:22,014
interest.
It's been retaken and they're cleaning 

4373
03:18:23,641 --> 03:18:25,920
the shia out right now.
Are you serious?

4374
03:18:25,921 --> 03:18:30,921
That's fucking breaking god damn news 
shit up on info wars.

4375
03:18:31,110 --> 03:18:34,040
The cio as cleaning house.
Oh my god.

4376
03:18:35,100 --> 03:18:37,890
Are you kidding me?
Why isn't that the headline news on info

4377
03:18:37,891 --> 03:18:41,240
wars right now,
the rock tee shirt,

4378
03:18:41,400 --> 03:18:44,430
a lot of folks did really,
really crazy things for the cia.

4379
03:18:46,220 --> 03:18:47,740
The cia does like the fighting

4380
03:18:48,100 --> 03:18:48,933
and they were all pissed off and they 
were portrayed by infiltrators inside 

4381
03:18:51,521 --> 03:18:53,500
the cia.
really bad stuff that went on,

4382
03:18:53,501 --> 03:18:57,070
but right now there is a counter kid 
within the cia going on and cleaned them

4383
03:18:57,071 --> 03:19:00,430
out while they're definitely trying.
Jesus christ.

4384
03:19:01,480 --> 03:19:04,120
I like what I'm hearing.
We'll see what happens,

4385
03:19:04,121 --> 03:19:04,954
but are you?
Are you happy about the futures 

4386
03:19:08,590 --> 03:19:10,450
succeeds?
Within three years,

4387
03:19:10,451 --> 03:19:13,090
you're going to hear major cancer cures 
announced.

4388
03:19:13,330 --> 03:19:15,360
You're goiNg to hear a new energy 
systems announce.

4389
03:19:15,620 --> 03:19:16,453
You're going to hear a new companies 
announced they've suppressed all this 

4390
03:19:18,551 --> 03:19:22,030
stuff and trump what good people want to
empower humanity.

4391
03:19:22,360 --> 03:19:23,193
They believe in the species and the 
planet and big stuff's about how god 

4392
03:19:25,951 --> 03:19:28,420
damn crazy would be if trump became a 
hero.

4393
03:19:28,960 --> 03:19:30,100
He is,
he wrote about,

4394
03:19:30,140 --> 03:19:31,910
but do you know how crazy it was?
Hit the.

4395
03:19:31,920 --> 03:19:34,420
The country accepted him.
If they figured this out after.

4396
03:19:34,421 --> 03:19:36,550
If this is all true.
This all comes through exactly as you're

4397
03:19:36,551 --> 03:19:37,384
saying,
which I really have no idea if you're 

4398
03:19:38,561 --> 03:19:38,960
right

4399
03:19:38,960 --> 03:19:40,370
and you know what you could play right 
now.

4400
03:19:40,460 --> 03:19:41,293
How about that bill clinton clip that 
you played where he's talking about 

4401
03:19:44,601 --> 03:19:49,601
vetting immigrants like more hardcore 
than trucks and we're going to all that.

4402
03:19:50,160 --> 03:19:51,680
everybody.
How do you pull that?

4403
03:19:51,681 --> 03:19:53,070
How does clinton and

4404
03:19:53,430 --> 03:19:57,480
bill clinton and hillary promote wall 
and the wall's got halfway agree,

4405
03:19:57,481 --> 03:20:00,150
disagree with them on the wall?
Because people do a ladder over.

4406
03:20:00,180 --> 03:20:02,340
It's metaphysical.
It's like we're a country.

4407
03:20:02,341 --> 03:20:03,870
We're allowed to have this.
Mexico has one.

4408
03:20:04,110 --> 03:20:06,000
Canada has one account.
Why can't we?

4409
03:20:06,300 --> 03:20:09,420
The big thing is just deport people that
are on welfare.

4410
03:20:09,570 --> 03:20:10,403
We need people from Mexico and Russia 
and Japan and just to poor people that 

4411
03:20:14,791 --> 03:20:16,020
are on welfare.
It's the only deport,

4412
03:20:16,021 --> 03:20:16,854
the poorest ones.
The ones that can't say if you won't do 

4413
03:20:19,981 --> 03:20:22,380
anything and you're calm here.
Yeah,

4414
03:20:22,381 --> 03:20:23,101
we'll call out.
Okay,

4415
03:20:23,101 --> 03:20:25,410
so when they come over here,
you're saying give him a chance,

4416
03:20:25,411 --> 03:20:27,630
but then once if they try to stay on 
welfare,

4417
03:20:27,700 --> 03:20:30,260
that wasn't always sell more shit or not
sounds

4418
03:20:30,260 --> 03:20:33,710
good.
In 1995,

4419
03:20:34,150 --> 03:20:35,700
listen,
this is in 1995,

4420
03:20:35,770 --> 03:20:37,940
just totally in the states,
most heavily affected,

4421
03:20:37,941 --> 03:20:38,774
but in every place in this country are 
rightly disturbed by the large numbers 

4422
03:20:42,320 --> 03:20:43,153
of illegal aliens entering our country.
The jobs they home might otherwise be 

4423
03:20:47,751 --> 03:20:48,584
held by citizeNs or legal immigrants.
The public service they use impose 

4424
03:20:51,741 --> 03:20:52,574
burdens on our taxpayers.
that's why our administration has moved 

4425
03:20:55,731 --> 03:20:56,564
aggressively to secure our borders more 
by hiring a record number of new border 

4426
03:20:59,961 --> 03:21:03,620
guards by deporting twice as many 
criminal aliens is ever before.

4427
03:21:04,040 --> 03:21:08,980
By cracking down on illegal hiring,
by borrowing welfare benefits to illegal

4428
03:21:09,040 --> 03:21:09,873
aliens that I will present to you,
we will try to do more to speed the 

4429
03:21:13,911 --> 03:21:14,744
deportation of illegal aliens who were 
arrested for crimes to better identify 

4430
03:21:18,021 --> 03:21:18,854
illegal aliens in the workplace as 
recommended by the commission headed by 

4431
03:21:21,951 --> 03:21:26,450
former congresswoman Barbara Jordan.
We are a nation of immigrants,

4432
03:21:26,990 --> 03:21:29,300
but we are also a nation of laws.

4433
03:21:29,750 --> 03:21:30,583
It is wrong and ultimately self 
defeating for a nation of immigrants to 

4434
03:21:34,221 --> 03:21:35,054
permit the kind of abuse of our 
immigration laws we have seen in recent 

4435
03:21:38,630 --> 03:21:39,463
years,
and we must do more to stop it if that 

4436
03:21:42,561 --> 03:21:46,080
doesn't vindicate fucking trump on all 
fence shit,

4437
03:21:46,120 --> 03:21:49,470
but it also makes you realize what a bad
motherfucker bill clinton was.

4438
03:21:49,471 --> 03:21:53,420
His trump can make a speech that bill 
clinton was a good guy.

4439
03:21:53,840 --> 03:21:58,840
Hit me.
He hit each other walk.

4440
03:22:01,740 --> 03:22:02,573
If you're a chick out there marching,
talking about the wall and you just 

4441
03:22:05,811 --> 03:22:08,120
heard that,
that was not a real realize.

4442
03:22:08,300 --> 03:22:11,570
I'm giving you a chance.
Admit you were pumped.

4443
03:22:11,690 --> 03:22:14,180
It's okay.
everybody gets powerful power punch.

4444
03:22:14,181 --> 03:22:17,600
But from this point on,
shut the fuck up about it will power.

4445
03:22:17,601 --> 03:22:18,230
That's not.
No.

4446
03:22:18,230 --> 03:22:18,771
Okay.
Let's,

4447
03:22:18,771 --> 03:22:19,604
uh,
that's about it.

4448
03:22:20,330 --> 03:22:23,030
A time.
Take one dose.

4449
03:22:24,230 --> 03:22:27,820
If I give you full power,
you're going to be in the hit.

4450
03:22:29,600 --> 03:22:31,370
It's five.
We're going to wrap this up.

4451
03:22:31,371 --> 03:22:32,600
We got it.
We did a good job.

4452
03:22:33,190 --> 03:22:34,940
Ask one more question.
Go ahead.

4453
03:22:34,970 --> 03:22:35,803
One more.
I,

4454
03:22:36,000 --> 03:22:37,310
I,
you know me,

4455
03:22:37,311 --> 03:22:39,350
I'm fucking fascinated with the 
conspiracy.

4456
03:22:39,351 --> 03:22:40,670
They're just like you.
Every night.

4457
03:22:41,300 --> 03:22:42,133
Dudes are watching fights in boxing.
I'm listening to conspiracy theories 

4458
03:22:44,750 --> 03:22:46,220
every fucking night.
When I go to bed,

4459
03:22:46,310 --> 03:22:48,440
I listen to Alex Jones everyday,
everyday.

4460
03:22:48,680 --> 03:22:51,290
The one thing that gets that I don't 
get.

4461
03:22:51,530 --> 03:22:54,350
I get the establishment,
I get the illuminati,

4462
03:22:54,470 --> 03:22:56,990
I get all that shit,
but then there's ronald reagan.

4463
03:22:57,110 --> 03:22:57,943
Every now and then you have dr steve 
progenic on your show and he's talking 

4464
03:23:00,651 --> 03:23:05,651
about some serious conspiracy diaries.
All this shit is confirming everything.

4465
03:23:06,051 --> 03:23:06,884
He's deep in the cia confirming shit,
but then when they talk about ronald 

4466
03:23:09,261 --> 03:23:10,094
reagan,
they talk about like he was the last 

4467
03:23:11,360 --> 03:23:14,570
great president and I thought that 
actor,

4468
03:23:14,571 --> 03:23:16,990
the guy was an fbi informant,
isn't any,

4469
03:23:17,030 --> 03:23:20,120
so god damn establisHment ronald reagan.

4470
03:23:20,270 --> 03:23:21,980
I don't get that.
Explain ronald reagan.

4471
03:23:22,160 --> 03:23:25,100
I mean george senior was the vice 
president,

4472
03:23:25,340 --> 03:23:28,920
director of the cia and he just seems 
like the salt,

4473
03:23:29,090 --> 03:23:30,280
but this is once in a while.
Okay.

4474
03:23:30,440 --> 03:23:32,300
ExplAin ronald reagan if you want to end
the transmission.

4475
03:23:32,301 --> 03:23:33,740
Let's explain.
Ronald reagan.

4476
03:23:33,741 --> 03:23:34,574
Go ahead.
We're just joking around punching 

4477
03:23:35,721 --> 03:23:36,280
earlier.
No,

4478
03:23:36,280 --> 03:23:37,070
no,
it's okay.

4479
03:23:37,070 --> 03:23:41,750
But his question wanting more hours.
He wants to know about ronald reagan.

4480
03:23:42,500 --> 03:23:44,420
Hold off because I can trust telling me 
the movies.

4481
03:23:44,430 --> 03:23:45,980
Okay.
Ronald reagan.

4482
03:23:46,010 --> 03:23:47,690
We're not in some blood fests with 
reagan,

4483
03:23:47,691 --> 03:23:50,560
but after all the obama globalization,
it's like I'm astounded.

4484
03:23:50,600 --> 03:23:51,433
Good thing.
Reagan ran against george herbert 

4485
03:23:53,601 --> 03:23:55,630
walker.
Bush said he was global,

4486
03:23:55,631 --> 03:23:59,150
a cfr world government.
Then they told him at the convention,

4487
03:23:59,151 --> 03:24:00,080
okay,
you won,

4488
03:24:00,350 --> 03:24:02,480
but we're going to not let you have the 
domination if you don't want to.

4489
03:24:02,481 --> 03:24:05,270
Put a herbert walker bush,
and then a year end they shooting.

4490
03:24:05,710 --> 03:24:08,630
They just released that guy and so all 
this stuff went.

4491
03:24:08,631 --> 03:24:09,830
Oh shit,
I didn't know.

4492
03:24:09,831 --> 03:24:10,664
So reagan didn't get his agenda through 
and they tagged on Iran contra all this 

4493
03:24:13,941 --> 03:24:16,220
other stuff.
Reagan actually wanted to get rid of the

4494
03:24:16,221 --> 03:24:18,670
irs and a bunch of good stuff.
So yeah,

4495
03:24:18,671 --> 03:24:22,190
I noticed the anticommunist.
He was running against George Bush.

4496
03:24:22,191 --> 03:24:23,024
He beat him and then when he got the 
presidential nomination for the 

4497
03:24:25,791 --> 03:24:28,310
republican party,
they made him.

4498
03:24:28,340 --> 03:24:31,980
They forced him to take the drug store 
witH forced way.

4499
03:24:32,050 --> 03:24:35,000
None of the ronald reagan and I wanted 
to believe in obama,

4500
03:24:35,001 --> 03:24:39,110
but he's a total level of a new tax.
Things crazy.

4501
03:24:40,030 --> 03:24:41,690
Once you think of that,
it's pretty radical.

4502
03:24:42,140 --> 03:24:43,770
Joe Got mad at us trading punches.

4503
03:24:47,420 --> 03:24:48,730
Trump on trump.
Give me.

4504
03:24:48,740 --> 03:24:49,573
Took me up people.
There's people out there that think 

4505
03:24:50,911 --> 03:24:51,744
trump is racist and they think he's a 
sexist at a whoremonger closer 

4506
03:24:58,700 --> 03:25:03,560
whoremonger sexist and I'm not.
Okay,

4507
03:25:03,640 --> 03:25:05,340
well good for him.
A lot of people do.

4508
03:25:05,380 --> 03:25:07,200
Okay,
so you think he's a good guy?

4509
03:25:07,860 --> 03:25:09,680
I know trump's a good guy.
He at.

4510
03:25:09,720 --> 03:25:12,750
What he's done is he's delivered like no
president ever.

4511
03:25:12,830 --> 03:25:13,663
Alright.
Everybody.

4512
03:25:13,770 --> 03:25:14,603
So everybody wants to find some reason 
to hate him and some reason to figure 

4513
03:25:18,781 --> 03:25:21,540
out a way to get him out of office,
but we shouldn't.

4514
03:25:21,600 --> 03:25:23,470
We at this point.
I mean he,

4515
03:25:23,540 --> 03:25:24,840
he won their game,
right?

4516
03:25:24,841 --> 03:25:28,200
There's a popularity contest.
He won the popularity contest and that's

4517
03:25:28,201 --> 03:25:29,034
really what being president is.
Figuring out a way to get the most 

4518
03:25:31,171 --> 03:25:32,850
amount of people to say,
I like you better.

4519
03:25:32,990 --> 03:25:33,823
I mean That's really what it is.
And he's the first truly popular person 

4520
03:25:36,690 --> 03:25:40,290
who's really good at manipulating the 
media to win a popularity contest.

4521
03:25:40,620 --> 03:25:43,140
Everybody before him had just been a 
politician.

4522
03:25:43,141 --> 03:25:43,974
He's the first guy that's actually 
famous that then became presidents two 

4523
03:25:47,191 --> 03:25:47,850
point.
Oh,

4524
03:25:47,850 --> 03:25:50,780
it's never happened before.
Been a half hours.

4525
03:25:50,820 --> 03:25:55,230
So reagan,
that was the California.

4526
03:25:55,231 --> 03:25:56,064
It's 5:00.

4527
03:25:58,180 --> 03:25:59,640
That's the only two and a half hours.
Yeah,

4528
03:25:59,641 --> 03:26:03,170
but the point being that he's.
He wasn't that famous,

4529
03:26:04,010 --> 03:26:04,843
famous like Donald Trump.
I don't think he was famous movie star 

4530
03:26:08,280 --> 03:26:09,240
reagan.
Are you cutting?

4531
03:26:09,300 --> 03:26:10,133
True,
but I don't think he was a big movie 

4532
03:26:11,191 --> 03:26:12,690
star.
I think he was Christian Slater.

4533
03:26:12,691 --> 03:26:14,690
She probably doesn't.
Trump wasn't a movie star.

4534
03:26:14,691 --> 03:26:16,020
No fence.
Christian slater.

4535
03:26:16,021 --> 03:26:17,490
I loved you in blade.
Hey,

4536
03:26:17,540 --> 03:26:20,310
who's in dade county jail?
He was in blade,

4537
03:26:20,311 --> 03:26:22,310
right?
Ms dot christine slade and blood job.

4538
03:26:22,650 --> 03:26:24,460
No,
stephen dorff was.

4539
03:26:24,510 --> 03:26:25,550
Well it was.
So.

4540
03:26:25,570 --> 03:26:28,920
It was ronald reagan.
Did he get his.

4541
03:26:28,950 --> 03:26:29,783
I'm ready to end this right now,
but I'm telling you once in a lifetime 

4542
03:26:32,281 --> 03:26:33,690
interview,
we haven't got that real questions.

4543
03:26:33,960 --> 03:26:38,060
We're only two and half hours in five,
three and a half hours.

4544
03:26:38,590 --> 03:26:42,960
When we go live underneath what?
Thirty will I have a 1:30.

4545
03:26:42,961 --> 03:26:45,080
We're sitting in the chair before austin
time.

4546
03:26:45,850 --> 03:26:47,340
Look at the clock right next to you.
See,

4547
03:26:47,341 --> 03:26:49,040
it's 5:00.
Yeah,

4548
03:26:49,170 --> 03:26:50,460
fine.
I'm wearing louis.

4549
03:26:50,500 --> 03:26:51,333
You want to talk?
All I know is that most of your 

4550
03:26:52,181 --> 03:26:53,014
listeners should know,
really told you the real truth of what 

4551
03:26:55,981 --> 03:26:57,940
I've researched.
You shouldn't believe him as sham,

4552
03:26:58,320 --> 03:27:01,290
their total corporate whores.
What do you think is gonna happen?

4553
03:27:01,291 --> 03:27:02,124
How do you think this is going to play 
out now that you think this sort of 

4554
03:27:04,921 --> 03:27:05,754
silent,
bloodless coup is taking place and this 

4555
03:27:07,831 --> 03:27:08,664
guy has gotten through this net that had
been set there to make sure that no one 

4556
03:27:13,171 --> 03:27:15,840
other than the people that were already 
inside the system could ever run it,

4557
03:27:15,900 --> 03:27:17,450
so he got through.
That was a.

4558
03:27:17,670 --> 03:27:18,503
He's running it now.
We're going to wrap up once in a 

4559
03:27:21,031 --> 03:27:23,940
lifetime situation.
Trump isn't perfect.

4560
03:27:23,941 --> 03:27:27,540
He really wants to empower humanity.
All of us have to work hard,

4561
03:27:27,840 --> 03:27:29,610
be involved here.
Our views,

4562
03:27:29,910 --> 03:27:30,743
put out our ideas and just move forward 
with the airplane to try to assassinate 

4563
03:27:33,751 --> 03:27:34,950
trump.
You think so?

4564
03:27:35,010 --> 03:27:35,843
Oh god.
They're demonizing him saying killing 

4565
03:27:37,001 --> 03:27:38,250
them all.
Fascinating.

4566
03:27:38,251 --> 03:27:39,084
For real,
or do you mean assassInated him 

4567
03:27:40,430 --> 03:27:42,340
publicly?
Like politically

4568
03:27:42,340 --> 03:27:43,173
assassinated.
They want to politically destroy his 

4569
03:27:44,441 --> 03:27:48,730
name and they want to politically also 
try to kill him.

4570
03:27:49,030 --> 03:27:49,863
All I know is America had half the 
wealth of the world 20 years ago and 

4571
03:27:55,541 --> 03:27:56,374
five percent of the world population.
We've lost half that wealth and it's 

4572
03:28:00,731 --> 03:28:04,840
that as we get more powerful,
they get more powerful and the elite had

4573
03:28:04,841 --> 03:28:07,240
been trying to domesticate America.
Not that we're perfect,

4574
03:28:07,450 --> 03:28:08,283
but we've got ideas of industry and 
ideas and doing things that change 

4575
03:28:12,221 --> 03:28:13,054
everything.
And so The really this planet want to 

4576
03:28:14,681 --> 03:28:17,320
kill competition.
They want to consolidate control.

4577
03:28:17,321 --> 03:28:19,540
They want to end the internet of 
governments.

4578
03:28:19,541 --> 03:28:21,060
That's America.
They were about,

4579
03:28:21,100 --> 03:28:23,100
if hillary would have won,
they would have censored the.

4580
03:28:23,250 --> 03:28:26,030
Oh yeah.
How are they going to look it up?

4581
03:28:26,070 --> 03:28:26,903
Look it up.
I'm actually surprised how fast that's 

4582
03:28:29,780 --> 03:28:31,510
all.
Putting the pieces together.

4583
03:28:31,511 --> 03:28:32,560
There were about to do it.

4584
03:28:32,820 --> 03:28:33,653
Okay.
Tell them the headline is obama 

4585
03:28:35,351 --> 03:28:40,351
establishes ministry of truth three 
weeks before trump takes office one week

4586
03:28:40,431 --> 03:28:41,264
after a trump's elected.
So ministry of truth being something 

4587
03:28:44,441 --> 03:28:45,274
that stops fake news,
the news the government doesn't agree 

4588
03:28:48,431 --> 03:28:49,264
with,
right?

4589
03:28:49,360 --> 03:28:53,550
So The problem becomes,
how do we decide what's fake science?

4590
03:28:53,740 --> 03:28:55,120
Go back,
please go back please.

4591
03:28:55,270 --> 03:28:56,103
Obama quietly signs the countering 
disinformation and propaganda act into 

4592
03:28:59,801 --> 03:29:00,880
law.
Wow.

4593
03:29:01,000 --> 03:29:01,833
late on friday with the us population 
embracing the upcoming holidays and 

4594
03:29:04,541 --> 03:29:07,210
oblivious of most news emerging from the
administration,

4595
03:29:07,480 --> 03:29:12,480
obama quietly signed into law the 2017 
national defense authorization act,

4596
03:29:13,060 --> 03:29:17,590
which authorizes $611,000,000,000
for the military in 2017.

4597
03:29:17,591 --> 03:29:19,780
In His statement,
obama said blah blah,

4598
03:29:19,781 --> 03:29:21,040
blah,
blah blah.

4599
03:29:21,041 --> 03:29:21,874
Whereas it say,
he says lots of over the governor's 

4600
03:29:25,511 --> 03:29:28,390
board of governors,
the fcc federalize the media,

4601
03:29:28,391 --> 03:29:33,070
meaning federalized television shows and
radio transmissions,

4602
03:29:33,280 --> 03:29:35,550
your website,
old galaxy.

4603
03:29:35,551 --> 03:29:37,240
She your website,
my website.

4604
03:29:37,240 --> 03:29:39,280
Everybody's website.
What do you guys.

4605
03:29:39,281 --> 03:29:40,114
What are you doing?
She says obama last minute bills like 

4606
03:29:42,131 --> 03:29:45,970
all that shit.
He signed shit.

4607
03:29:46,090 --> 03:29:49,000
Read down a little lower.
It says in the bill,

4608
03:29:49,270 --> 03:29:51,350
we're going to federalize committee.
Put it back.

4609
03:29:51,580 --> 03:29:54,340
Was going to find a.
We're going to federalize communications

4610
03:29:54,610 --> 03:29:58,240
and put the cia over the board of 
governors of the federal communications.

4611
03:29:58,241 --> 03:29:59,074
That sounds so crazy.
Did you would have been subject to that 

4612
03:30:02,591 --> 03:30:03,500
shit.
Could easily.

4613
03:30:04,790 --> 03:30:06,250
You can't talk about that.
No more.

4614
03:30:06,340 --> 03:30:09,490
Of course hillary would have won.
That would've happened.

4615
03:30:09,491 --> 03:30:11,880
Dude.
See,

4616
03:30:11,890 --> 03:30:14,020
I wonder if people would have ever went 
for that.

4617
03:30:14,050 --> 03:30:15,850
That seems.
Let me show at trump does.

4618
03:30:16,210 --> 03:30:17,043
He is like up till two in the morning.
Everybody knows tweeting twitter video 

4619
03:30:20,861 --> 03:30:22,630
clips.
He gets on the internet now.

4620
03:30:22,660 --> 03:30:26,290
He'S a conspIracy theorist,
which means any questions about trump?

4621
03:30:27,320 --> 03:30:29,650
He's got.
I'm not saying trump's perfect.

4622
03:30:29,860 --> 03:30:32,140
I'm going to keep trump honest.
Anything.

4623
03:30:32,200 --> 03:30:33,033
I'm going to come out against him.
The point is is that he's a different 

4624
03:30:35,711 --> 03:30:38,590
kind of thing and you can keep a rogue 
element.

4625
03:30:38,830 --> 03:30:40,010
Nine slash 11.
Is he

4626
03:30:40,010 --> 03:30:40,843
going to do anything about that?
Already exposed the fact that elements 

4627
03:30:43,421 --> 03:30:44,254
of the government work with Saudi Arabia
to launch the September 11th attacks 16 

4628
03:30:47,871 --> 03:30:49,460
years ago,
going to reopen that shit.

4629
03:30:49,490 --> 03:30:50,870
He said he will.
You think that.

4630
03:30:51,090 --> 03:30:54,320
Imagine that.
Imagine the re.

4631
03:30:55,730 --> 03:30:56,563
Imagine alien bases on the moon.
Please tell them to release that 

4632
03:31:00,681 --> 03:31:01,514
information,
but the alien bases on the next 

4633
03:31:02,450 --> 03:31:04,370
question.
What does he know about geoengineering?

4634
03:31:04,700 --> 03:31:07,080
What does he know about aliens?
Not.

4635
03:31:07,150 --> 03:31:08,330
Not about aliens.
Fuck,

4636
03:31:08,350 --> 03:31:08,741
no,
no,

4637
03:31:08,741 --> 03:31:09,051
no,
no,

4638
03:31:09,051 --> 03:31:12,390
no.
I want to know about chem trails.

4639
03:31:12,560 --> 03:31:14,190
You don't say fuck aliens.
Okay.

4640
03:31:14,250 --> 03:31:15,083
Alright,
let's do it.

4641
03:31:16,630 --> 03:31:19,850
I'm back on back on Donald Trump call 
lately.

4642
03:31:19,910 --> 03:31:24,910
I'm holding on aliens and alien bigfoot 
10 years ago.

4643
03:31:28,340 --> 03:31:29,970
Go ahead,
ring,

4644
03:31:30,000 --> 03:31:30,833
ring,
ring,

4645
03:31:30,870 --> 03:31:31,461
ring,
ring,

4646
03:31:31,461 --> 03:31:32,061
ring.
Here we go.

4647
03:31:32,061 --> 03:31:33,320
Hi alex.
Oh mr.

4648
03:31:33,410 --> 03:31:35,720
president,
what's going on?

4649
03:31:35,721 --> 03:31:36,554
Well,
whatever the agenda forward to cut 

4650
03:31:38,121 --> 03:31:39,140
taxes.
Do you think?

4651
03:31:39,680 --> 03:31:40,513
Well,
I should know about those secret space 

4652
03:31:41,511 --> 03:31:42,321
patients.
Wow.

4653
03:31:42,321 --> 03:31:43,154
Alex,
you've got to come to trump tower for 

4654
03:31:44,661 --> 03:31:47,150
those meetings.
I'll come to trump tower.

4655
03:31:47,360 --> 03:31:48,193
I to know about aliens.
Hey asked trump if he wants to learn 

4656
03:31:50,331 --> 03:31:55,110
some jujitsu.
Half a fly to New York to be with.

4657
03:31:55,150 --> 03:31:57,320
You want to Be drunk?
I want to see the bodies.

4658
03:31:57,321 --> 03:31:59,770
Alien bodies will go to a trump on the 
show.

4659
03:32:00,350 --> 03:32:02,030
Alex,
he mentioned trump on the show.

4660
03:32:02,031 --> 03:32:06,290
That would be huge for him.
Probably not a good idea for anybody.

4661
03:32:06,550 --> 03:32:11,520
No.
I don't know if he wanted joe.

4662
03:32:11,750 --> 03:32:13,760
I don't care if you're too cool for 
this.

4663
03:32:13,990 --> 03:32:14,690
Well,
I.

4664
03:32:14,690 --> 03:32:16,550
we have to get the fuck out of here for 
sure.

4665
03:32:16,640 --> 03:32:18,740
Let's talk about whether or not we're 
going to eat or anything else,

4666
03:32:18,741 --> 03:32:20,270
but uh,
it's already 5:00,

4667
03:32:20,480 --> 03:32:21,313
so we're at a three and a half hours in.
Is there anything more that you have to 

4668
03:32:23,751 --> 03:32:26,000
say before we get out of here?
Let me get another question.

4669
03:32:26,001 --> 03:32:26,391
Is it?
No,

4670
03:32:26,391 --> 03:32:26,841
no.
Eddie,

4671
03:32:26,841 --> 03:32:28,180
I want to ask alex.
No,

4672
03:32:28,190 --> 03:32:30,140
I mean literally I really shake the 
truth,

4673
03:32:30,460 --> 03:32:34,190
tell the truth and force.com
has all our articles,

4674
03:32:34,191 --> 03:32:35,570
our research,
our videos,

4675
03:32:35,571 --> 03:32:39,290
our podcasts,
what we do and I'm not left or right.

4676
03:32:39,350 --> 03:32:40,183
I'm not liberal or conservative.
I'm really trying to find out what's 

4677
03:32:41,871 --> 03:32:44,120
going on in the world.
And so after all these years,

4678
03:32:44,121 --> 03:32:49,010
joe has been a.
I love really good questions.

4679
03:32:49,280 --> 03:32:51,230
You kind of knew all of this.
I was going to bring up.

4680
03:32:52,360 --> 03:32:53,193
You just keep you just get crazy and you
want to keep going and keep going and 

4681
03:32:54,941 --> 03:32:55,790
keep going to keep going.

4682
03:32:55,790 --> 03:32:57,020
But I think sometimes you got to go,
okay,

4683
03:32:57,170 --> 03:32:58,003
hold that thought.
Expand and explain because a lot of 

4684
03:33:00,141 --> 03:33:01,820
times things that.
But hold on a second eddie.

4685
03:33:01,940 --> 03:33:04,550
Things that are in your head,
self explanatory.

4686
03:33:04,551 --> 03:33:05,384
You already know about it if there's a 
giant percentage of the people that are 

4687
03:33:07,101 --> 03:33:08,840
listening to this have no idea what 
you're talking about.

4688
03:33:09,590 --> 03:33:10,423
I get it.
I want to say this for the joe rogan 

4689
03:33:12,981 --> 03:33:15,140
listeners,
have an open mind.

4690
03:33:15,141 --> 03:33:16,910
You heard him for three and a half 
hours.

4691
03:33:17,300 --> 03:33:18,133
Download that app.
That info wars app started listening to 

4692
03:33:20,840 --> 03:33:21,381
him.
Eddie,

4693
03:33:21,381 --> 03:33:22,760
why don't you do your show and info 
wars.

4694
03:33:23,000 --> 03:33:25,820
That's the move to eddie Bravo radio 
comes back on info wars.

4695
03:33:27,080 --> 03:33:32,080
I would do that rogan's champlain,
but listen,

4696
03:33:32,260 --> 03:33:32,931
but listen.
Okay,

4697
03:33:32,931 --> 03:33:33,261
but.
Oh,

4698
03:33:33,261 --> 03:33:36,820
but listen,
I'm focusing on effect.

4699
03:33:37,860 --> 03:33:38,100
All

4700
03:33:38,100 --> 03:33:40,560
I want people,
I give him a chance.

4701
03:33:40,590 --> 03:33:44,720
He doesn't know shit about space,
but when it comes to politics to.

4702
03:33:45,470 --> 03:33:47,040
Yeah.
When it comes to politics,

4703
03:33:47,280 --> 03:33:49,000
he's.
He's a fucking master.

4704
03:33:49,010 --> 03:33:50,420
He's.
He's like,

4705
03:33:52,210 --> 03:33:55,380
he's like helio gracie and that's a 
compliment space.

4706
03:33:55,800 --> 03:33:56,633
He's.
Joe wrote about jamie pulled something 

4707
03:33:59,581 --> 03:34:00,414
out was he signed this countering 
foreign propaganda and disinformation 

4708
03:34:04,891 --> 03:34:05,724
act of 2016 to build.
Expresses the sense of this bill 

4709
03:34:08,911 --> 03:34:11,970
expresses the sense of congress that 
what a weird expression.

4710
03:34:12,000 --> 03:34:12,960
Okay,
what are we looking at?

4711
03:34:13,130 --> 03:34:15,420
This is that bill,
that anti propaganda bill,

4712
03:34:15,570 --> 03:34:16,403
foreign governments,
including the government of the russian 

4713
03:34:18,061 --> 03:34:20,310
federation in China,
used Him for this information,

4714
03:34:20,340 --> 03:34:21,173
other propaganda tools to undermine the 
national security objectives of the 

4715
03:34:23,191 --> 03:34:25,680
United States and key allies and 
partners.

4716
03:34:25,681 --> 03:34:26,514
The us government should develop a 
comprehensive strategy to counter 

4717
03:34:29,911 --> 03:34:30,744
foreign disinformation and propaganda 
and assert leadership and developing a 

4718
03:34:33,691 --> 03:34:34,524
fact base strategic narrative,
and an important element of this 

4719
03:34:37,651 --> 03:34:41,910
strategy should be to help promote an 
independent press and countries that are

4720
03:34:41,911 --> 03:34:43,830
vulnerable to foreign disinformation.

4721
03:34:44,070 --> 03:34:47,670
Translate that msm is on the ropes,
are panicking.

4722
03:34:48,120 --> 03:34:49,680
They'll want to shut down their 
competition.

4723
03:34:49,890 --> 03:34:50,723
What american watching this or listening
doesn't think they should decide what 

4724
03:34:53,891 --> 03:34:54,724
they should listen to it not.
Do you think that would be ever 

4725
03:34:56,221 --> 03:34:58,110
accepted?
That they would allow people,

4726
03:34:58,740 --> 03:35:02,360
someone that works in the government to 
censor websites and podcasts.

4727
03:35:02,410 --> 03:35:04,530
Vamos signed already happened.
Yeah,

4728
03:35:04,531 --> 03:35:05,460
but this one,
China,

4729
03:35:07,790 --> 03:35:10,680
they signed a bill to dry it.
Whoa.

4730
03:35:10,681 --> 03:35:13,140
Crazy.
Notice how I tell you damn bill,

4731
03:35:13,200 --> 03:35:14,033
one of the things about podcasts is that
they're basically just a pure 

4732
03:35:15,961 --> 03:35:16,794
conversation.
It's just peopLe sitting down and 

4733
03:35:17,671 --> 03:35:22,050
talking and if you.
If you stop pure conversations,

4734
03:35:22,200 --> 03:35:24,470
I mean that is like one of the most 
heinous formed.

4735
03:35:24,490 --> 03:35:25,710
Essentially.
It's too late.

4736
03:35:25,711 --> 03:35:27,810
You can't say you can't make a try.
You can try,

4737
03:35:28,200 --> 03:35:29,033
but if they really did get into office 
and dave really did try to implement 

4738
03:35:32,580 --> 03:35:33,413
some sort of a transition process,
I almost wish hillary would have won 

4739
03:35:38,550 --> 03:35:40,230
because that could have been outside the
power.

4740
03:35:40,570 --> 03:35:42,340
I keep trump on the list,
not attacked.

4741
03:35:42,350 --> 03:35:44,040
Trump does something wrong.
It's hard to find,

4742
03:35:44,041 --> 03:35:47,880
but he makes some mistakes like torture,
iphone codes or whatever,

4743
03:35:47,881 --> 03:35:50,490
but so torture you think is just.
It doesn't work.

4744
03:35:50,680 --> 03:35:52,950
It's not just at work.
It makes us look terrible.

4745
03:35:52,951 --> 03:35:55,020
It's a foreign country lowers us to 
their level.

4746
03:35:55,140 --> 03:35:56,010
Yeah,
exactly.

4747
03:35:56,160 --> 03:35:58,260
But trump came out and tortured two days
ago and said,

4748
03:35:58,261 --> 03:35:59,520
okay,
so he changed his mind.

4749
03:35:59,700 --> 03:36:02,170
He's good on stuff like that.
That's very unusual.

4750
03:36:02,180 --> 03:36:04,290
Waking up and when you wake up,
you change your mind.

4751
03:36:04,291 --> 03:36:09,240
I was also independently wealthy.
That's one of the things that's probably

4752
03:36:09,241 --> 03:36:13,230
a huge factor in this scabbing.
He's not part of the obama.

4753
03:36:13,250 --> 03:36:14,083
Hillary.
That's what I'm saying is that there's 

4754
03:36:17,190 --> 03:36:18,023
no calculation.
I just treat you like I want to be 

4755
03:36:19,621 --> 03:36:21,560
treated.
Big stuff is happening.

4756
03:36:21,570 --> 03:36:23,160
It's a very exciting time to ask you 
this.

4757
03:36:23,161 --> 03:36:24,840
Before we.
Before we wrap this up,

4758
03:36:25,320 --> 03:36:26,153
you know,
if trump is this new stage of politics 

4759
03:36:28,561 --> 03:36:29,394
or new type of politician,
what kind of person do you think would 

4760
03:36:31,291 --> 03:36:32,124
be like literally the perfect person to 
run this country and would the perfect 

4761
03:36:35,711 --> 03:36:36,110
person

4762
03:36:36,110 --> 03:36:38,440
do ron paul?
Ron paul is great,

4763
03:36:38,441 --> 03:36:39,274
but I think as somebody who's worked 
hard in private business who really has 

4764
03:36:41,891 --> 03:36:44,020
a sense of success,
who loves America,

4765
03:36:45,100 --> 03:36:49,000
who has been through the gauntlet of 
demonization attacks and dealt with it,

4766
03:36:49,350 --> 03:36:51,220
I think it's Donald Trump.
I mean,

4767
03:36:51,221 --> 03:36:52,780
you look at what he'S been through,
man,

4768
03:36:52,781 --> 03:36:53,614
who's been through this,
been a winner over and I'm not in some 

4769
03:36:56,551 --> 03:36:57,430
cults,
Donald Trump.

4770
03:36:57,710 --> 03:37:00,460
I think I want to hate him.
I want to not believe he's so good,

4771
03:37:00,790 --> 03:37:01,623
but man,
when he calls up and can like read your 

4772
03:37:02,951 --> 03:37:05,380
mind and knows what you were just 
thinking about,

4773
03:37:05,381 --> 03:37:06,220
you're like,
man,

4774
03:37:06,400 --> 03:37:10,240
this guy is like god or the devil.
This tax thing is very fascinating.

4775
03:37:10,400 --> 03:37:11,233
It's very interesting people.
It seemed to me the main street of 

4776
03:37:16,570 --> 03:37:19,990
billionaires are gonna pay it to me.
Every time I turn on my iphone.

4777
03:37:20,090 --> 03:37:24,350
You know what I didn't ask for fucking 
fox news bulletin.

4778
03:37:25,300 --> 03:37:27,760
They force feed me every morning.
Sienna.

4779
03:37:27,830 --> 03:37:31,420
So one of the joe rogan experience for 
info wars.

4780
03:37:31,660 --> 03:37:34,270
That's why you gotta say chanel,
because joe's real.

4781
03:37:34,271 --> 03:37:35,260
I'm real.
You're real.

4782
03:37:35,350 --> 03:37:36,540
Whether we're perfectly,
no matter.

4783
03:37:36,550 --> 03:37:37,383
We want to be real.
Everyone should humint human 

4784
03:37:39,491 --> 03:37:40,324
intelligence support this podcast and 
info wars and the joe rogan experience 

4785
03:37:44,051 --> 03:37:46,540
and make this dominant,
which it already is.

4786
03:37:46,690 --> 03:37:47,650
just to say,
listen,

4787
03:37:47,651 --> 03:37:50,140
bitches,
you may force feed eddie bravo,

4788
03:37:50,290 --> 03:37:52,540
a bunch of cnn,
fox news shit every morning,

4789
03:37:52,690 --> 03:37:56,590
but you're fucking getting the joe rogan
experience up your fucking ass.

4790
03:37:56,870 --> 03:37:57,703
Holy christ.
Every time I turn on my phone and look 

4791
03:38:01,421 --> 03:38:04,000
at what a cnn trying to fucking force 
feed.

4792
03:38:04,010 --> 03:38:04,843
Yeah.
Since when does the iphone force feed 

4793
03:38:07,220 --> 03:38:10,660
you?
The possessed demonic entity type?

4794
03:38:10,860 --> 03:38:13,400
Just a second.
Cooper.

4795
03:38:13,660 --> 03:38:18,660
I trump disease.
I'm on the anti trump,

4796
03:38:22,271 --> 03:38:25,270
but disadvantaged super nice guy.
He seems like a nice guy.

4797
03:38:25,600 --> 03:38:26,433
Cia.
He worked there like in college right 

4798
03:38:28,481 --> 03:38:29,314
now.
Beyond tHat,

4799
03:38:29,320 --> 03:38:30,640
beyond that,
he admitted it.

4800
03:38:31,120 --> 03:38:33,190
He's part of the light whip.
Cia.

4801
03:38:34,750 --> 03:38:36,190
Real.
Wait a minute.

4802
03:38:36,280 --> 03:38:41,080
see I as a whip division if you're the 
aster family.

4803
03:38:41,081 --> 03:38:45,220
lucky is or the vanderbilt,
vanderbilt,

4804
03:38:45,221 --> 03:38:46,960
john j.mr.
Myrick smith.

4805
03:38:47,230 --> 03:38:49,680
His name was my name too,
if you.

4806
03:38:49,860 --> 03:38:51,550
All right folks,
that's a wrap.

4807
03:38:51,790 --> 03:38:53,370
Now it's not.
Know.

4808
03:38:53,560 --> 03:38:54,393
Make fun of me at the very end.
We're talking about dental transcending 

4809
03:38:58,601 --> 03:38:59,680
information here.
Job.

4810
03:39:00,190 --> 03:39:04,030
I think sometimes we're talking about 
info wars.com

4811
03:39:04,350 --> 03:39:08,030
and joe rogan experience and andy bravo.
No problem.

4812
03:39:08,710 --> 03:39:09,543
Hey,
Soon to return to do a rock and roll 

4813
03:39:12,491 --> 03:39:13,690
conspiracy theory.
Oh,

4814
03:39:13,750 --> 03:39:15,490
it's your network.
If not,

4815
03:39:15,491 --> 03:39:16,940
he believes the cia.
Curious,

4816
03:39:19,300 --> 03:39:22,750
how does this go as well as you thought 
beyond that or better?

4817
03:39:22,810 --> 03:39:25,030
This was fun,
which is awesome.

4818
03:39:25,090 --> 03:39:26,230
I enjoyed it.
I you think of it?

4819
03:39:26,890 --> 03:39:27,723
What?

4820
03:39:27,850 --> 03:39:29,200
What did you think?
Your nine slash 11.

4821
03:39:29,820 --> 03:39:32,710
I thought it'd be exactly like this is 
as good as I could have hoped.

4822
03:39:32,711 --> 03:39:34,640
We had good time.
We had a lot of laughs.

4823
03:39:34,641 --> 03:39:35,474
We talked about some real shit.
We brought up some news articles that 

4824
03:39:38,421 --> 03:39:39,254
confirm a lot of crazy things that 
you're saying that makes me like all 

4825
03:39:41,541 --> 03:39:42,374
those new arrests there,
new arrest about pedophiles and sex 

4826
03:39:44,121 --> 03:39:45,500
slaves.
Like holy shit,

4827
03:39:45,501 --> 03:39:47,360
if that's real.
What story was,

4828
03:39:47,460 --> 03:39:48,293
what news source was?
That story was right and how many 

4829
03:39:52,431 --> 03:39:53,264
different is it like all over the place 
in India and a bunch of different news 

4830
03:39:55,191 --> 03:39:59,880
sources that one about the sex slaves 
and being released.

4831
03:39:59,890 --> 03:40:04,280
It's associated children,
so it's a mainstream story.

4832
03:40:04,490 --> 03:40:09,490
I'm sitting here thinking trump is a 
major force global force right now.

4833
03:40:11,750 --> 03:40:15,620
Trump and he talks to Alex Jones,
Alex Jones,

4834
03:40:15,650 --> 03:40:18,620
toxic joe rogan,
and I'm here because of joe rogan.

4835
03:40:18,620 --> 03:40:20,450
I'm like,
holy goddamn shit.

4836
03:40:20,451 --> 03:40:22,980
We got some kind of lightening bolt 
going through the world right now,

4837
03:40:23,270 --> 03:40:26,390
but it's not like joe's like.
It's like all of us together.

4838
03:40:26,730 --> 03:40:30,890
We're all there.
It had to be like this for it to be like

4839
03:40:30,891 --> 03:40:33,440
this every,
every day before today,

4840
03:40:33,700 --> 03:40:36,770
however it went down.
How to be like this for us,

4841
03:40:36,920 --> 03:40:37,753
for this to happen.
Are you wanting to be better than eight 

4842
03:40:39,501 --> 03:40:40,334
years before I come back and joe,
next time you're so you got to come and 

4843
03:40:42,710 --> 03:40:44,170
studio.
We have to do an interview.

4844
03:40:44,180 --> 03:40:47,120
ThAt store that foreign and 74 stories 
arrested was laying many,

4845
03:40:47,121 --> 03:40:48,710
many,
many major news sites.

4846
03:40:48,711 --> 03:40:49,544
It's crazy how it's real.
This isn't galactic thing going down 

4847
03:40:51,261 --> 03:40:52,020
right now,
man.

4848
03:40:52,020 --> 03:40:52,853
There's some interesting things are 
happening to people and it's happening 

4849
03:40:55,341 --> 03:40:57,680
at an accelerated rate and we're all 
part of it.

4850
03:40:57,681 --> 03:40:58,514
Everybody listening to this,
everybody talking to their friends and 

4851
03:41:00,050 --> 03:41:01,760
everybody rewind,
awaken everybody,

4852
03:41:01,761 --> 03:41:02,600
reading the internet.

4853
03:41:02,600 --> 03:41:05,120
Everybody watching documentaries and 
reading books.

4854
03:41:05,121 --> 03:41:08,060
Everybody understanding that we know 
more about how things work today than we

4855
03:41:08,061 --> 03:41:10,640
ever have before and it's weirder than 
we ever thought.

4856
03:41:11,660 --> 03:41:16,160
Isn't this discovering incredible.
The crazy thing is is when people aren't

4857
03:41:16,400 --> 03:41:18,830
you,
you're just not asleep and awake.

4858
03:41:19,160 --> 03:41:22,130
You're asleep and then you're partially 
awake.

4859
03:41:22,160 --> 03:41:22,941
You know about,
oh,

4860
03:41:22,941 --> 03:41:25,730
you discover,
you saw zike guys for the first time.

4861
03:41:25,970 --> 03:41:27,230
Oh,
you're partially awake.

4862
03:41:27,380 --> 03:41:28,940
You don't know about all this other 
stuff.

4863
03:41:29,060 --> 03:41:30,770
So when you hear about all the other 
stuff,

4864
03:41:30,830 --> 03:41:33,620
you still got that mentality where like,
that's bullshit.

4865
03:41:33,621 --> 03:41:36,770
That's bullshit.
People are partially awake.

4866
03:41:37,070 --> 03:41:39,650
Not,
not everybody's bullshit though.

4867
03:41:39,950 --> 03:41:40,783
That's the problem.
There's a lot of wacky conspiracies out 

4868
03:41:42,501 --> 03:41:47,501
there.
Monster dinosaurs aren't real shark.

4869
03:41:48,561 --> 03:41:53,561
They believe it's a a greenland shark.
Sharks or they think it's a shark that's

4870
03:41:54,051 --> 03:41:54,884
like a millions,
millions of years old and got into that 

4871
03:41:56,691 --> 03:41:57,524
water back when it was connected to the 
ocean because it's an ancient creature 

4872
03:41:59,721 --> 03:42:00,800
and they used to think they were 
extinct,

4873
03:42:00,801 --> 03:42:02,540
but now they don't anymore.
They found some.

4874
03:42:03,020 --> 03:42:03,551
So they,
they,

4875
03:42:03,551 --> 03:42:05,510
they think the loch ness monster.
That makes sense.

4876
03:42:05,540 --> 03:42:09,800
Or like a tWenty five foot right about 
what you get your information from.

4877
03:42:11,220 --> 03:42:15,490
Scientists from guys can't talk over 
each other,

4878
03:42:15,491 --> 03:42:17,570
but that's what it comes down to.
Hardly talking.

4879
03:42:17,740 --> 03:42:18,573
I know,
but he's talking about talk when you're 

4880
03:42:19,731 --> 03:42:22,370
talking about a greenland shark arm.
No.

4881
03:42:24,660 --> 03:42:26,150
We end the show.
Yes.

4882
03:42:26,180 --> 03:42:27,230
Eddie bravo back.
No,

4883
03:42:27,231 --> 03:42:27,560

4884
03:42:27,560 --> 03:42:27,920
no.
I'm gonna.

4885
03:42:27,920 --> 03:42:31,930
fuck you up.
And my left hand is my strongest because

4886
03:42:31,980 --> 03:42:34,320
I'm south.
Everybody have beautiful.

4887
03:42:34,321 --> 03:42:36,980
Thanks for listening.
Thanks for listening.

4888
03:42:37,330 --> 03:42:41,040
Thanks for tuning in to episode nine

4890
03:42:44,701 --> 03:42:45,570
