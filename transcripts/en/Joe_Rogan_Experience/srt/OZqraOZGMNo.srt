1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,030
The joe rogan experience.
Right.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,720
And then you can't trust if you're are
80 80 year old billionaire,

3
00:00:05,721 --> 00:00:09,770
you can't trust a girl who's willing to
fuck you with tapes,

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,860
exact test.
So then it's like a lot of like,

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,870
it's like three people fucking up.

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,440
You know what I thought was the most
bizarre about all of it?

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,960
Um,
apparently I was correct and that what

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,980
she is as far as the most recent story
is that she was supposed to record his

9
00:00:28,941 --> 00:00:32,030
saying his conversations because he
would say things and then forgot he sat

10
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:32,864
him.
Right.

11
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,010
So He's,
he's got,

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,890
he's dementia 81 years old,
these old as fuck.

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:42,080
So he would say crazy things and then
she would record them and you know,

14
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:44,050
and let him know like what he said.
Right.

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,460
Well in this case,
somehow or another,

16
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,120
it got leaked how it got leaked to
speculation,

17
00:00:50,121 --> 00:00:52,460
but he knew he was being recorded.
Right.

18
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,323
That is true.

19
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,010
So you can't,
it's against the law,

20
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:57,530
the record,
anyone like what if they don't say

21
00:00:57,531 --> 00:00:59,600
anything and it's just bathroom noises
and stuff.

22
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,820
It's against the law still.
Even if they don't talk in it.

23
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,040
Absolutely.
In California,

24
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,580
they don't know about it.
It's against the law.

25
00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:08,300
You're not allowed to record.
The essence can be like if you just put

26
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:11,210
a tape recorder down behind the toilet,
they don't say a word.

27
00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:12,490
They just,
you know,

28
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,750
and then they leave.
That's still against a law even though

29
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:16,940
they don't say it.
It said they're just their spirit being

30
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:17,570
in the room.

31
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,370
The noises of them,
um,

32
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,270
being recorded are actual physical
presence being marked by the sound of

33
00:01:23,271 --> 00:01:25,160
their feet.
I think that's probably illegal.

34
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,040
Really?
Yeah.

35
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,220
That's why they used to tape crank and
criminal.

36
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,750
So I said he guilty as fuck.
He's like,

37
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,500
if you take a tape and put it in behind
the toilets in Bourbon,

38
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,791
whatever,
whatever,

39
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,140
and the girl might happen to be a
stripper,

40
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,263
whatever,
whatever.

41
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,860
That combination is never gonna happen.
But if it did,

42
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,430
it's just they know that you were
recording her pooping.

43
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,220
It's interesting because I guess so the
recording like no,

44
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:53,691
no,
Brian,

45
00:01:53,691 --> 00:01:55,930
that's an interesting fucking spaces.
Interesting.

46
00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:59,210
When we talk about that you clam up when
you're like,

47
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,610
oh,
you can't require people pooping.

48
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,500
The real issue with putting all of your
eggs in one basket and that basket being

49
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:12,310
athletics and especially athletics,
especially combat athletics,

50
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,880
the idea that you're going to have some
sort of a long and successful fruitful

51
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:21,850
career by throwing your bones and
another person trying to separate

52
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:26,710
themselves from their consciousness.
That's quite ridiculous because just the

53
00:02:26,711 --> 00:02:31,711
very act of doing it in preparing for
that very active to the amount of damage

54
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:35,560
that your body and your brain even
endures is.

55
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,770
But we have this idea in our heads that
you know,

56
00:02:38,771 --> 00:02:41,390
a guy has to be an undefeated champion
and you know,

57
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,630
my son's going to be a champion someday.
Like,

58
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,760
man,
if you're really lucky,

59
00:02:45,761 --> 00:02:48,070
your son won't be a champion.
If you're really lucky,

60
00:02:48,071 --> 00:02:52,780
your son will learn the valuable lessons
of martial arts as far as like character

61
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:57,010
development and the as far as your
ability to overcome what seemed to be

62
00:02:57,011 --> 00:03:00,220
unsurmountable obstacle,
but to become a champion,

63
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,050
you have to be a crazy person.
Yeah.

64
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,620
You have to be crazy person who's
obsessed with nothing but that and that

65
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:06,730
will take over your life.

66
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,880
Yeah.
And I feel like having worked Avi

67
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,320
obviously with people like that,
you know,

68
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:14,690
shadowed them and recognizing that
mindset.

69
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,820
Um,
uh,

70
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,050
I,
you know,

71
00:03:18,051 --> 00:03:20,270
and I find too,
like there's just some point at which

72
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,750
like there's some gifts that are just
bestowed by genetics or something and it

73
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:28,910
didn't matter how hard you work,
you're not going to quite get to that.

74
00:03:28,911 --> 00:03:33,911
Maybe that level that separates the real
and you won't know that until you hit

75
00:03:34,371 --> 00:03:35,001
it.
You know what I mean?

76
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:37,400
You're not going to know that wall until
you run into it.

77
00:03:37,401 --> 00:03:40,430
And I feel like for some people,
like I was talking to one guy,

78
00:03:40,431 --> 00:03:42,680
just a guy at the gym and,
and uh,

79
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,960
he said something more or less like the
best that he,

80
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,140
he ever felt in a fight was when he was
up against someone he knew was better

81
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:48,974
than him.

82
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,740
And he knew he was going to lose.
And if they fought a hundred times,

83
00:03:51,741 --> 00:03:55,340
he'd lose a hundred times.
But he packed guy,

84
00:03:55,341 --> 00:03:57,410
he made that guy see something about
himself.

85
00:03:57,411 --> 00:04:00,320
He got that close to him that the other
guys sorta recognize.

86
00:04:00,321 --> 00:04:03,110
I'm a frail.
I made out of the same crumbling stuff

87
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:04,520
that he's made out of.
And so,

88
00:04:04,521 --> 00:04:07,090
you know,
sort of pierce that teflon armor that,

89
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:09,560
that I think some fighters carry around
with themselves and he's like,

90
00:04:09,561 --> 00:04:10,790
that's,
that's all I could do.

91
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,310
That for me is the victory.
I still lost.

92
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,880
But I made that guide,
discover something about himself that he

93
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,760
hadn't discovered up until that point
because he'd never been tested to the

94
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:22,280
point that I got to.
I was not able to test them.

95
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,890
And I thought that's another part about
just being,

96
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,190
recognizing what you're able to do,
you know,

97
00:04:28,191 --> 00:04:30,290
and it may not be beating them,
but it's you,

98
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,330
you find some other measure of success

99
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,153
you

100
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:35,830
eat.
First of all,

101
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:40,831
you being a veteran and you,
you being unabashed in your love for

102
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:43,390
soldiers and your respect for your,
your,

103
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:48,310
your fellow military members.
When you got on top of that cage and

104
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,061
after,
you know,

105
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:52,000
they were all cheering and you were
yelling out to all those people that you

106
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,460
loved them.
I mean this is all off camera man.

107
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:59,230
We had cut to commercial and you're on
top of the cage and you're just yelling

108
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:01,360
and all those people let them know that
you love them.

109
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,730
That's some intense intense shit.

110
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,870
Yeah.
Overwhelming emotional near shutdown.

111
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,430
Yeah.
I'm walking out to the cage and I see

112
00:05:10,431 --> 00:05:12,110
this dude,
he flies for the one 60th,

113
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,840
which is like the special forces wing of
aviation.

114
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,370
The last time I saw that dude was us
handing him my shot buddy.

115
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,793
You know,
I'm like,

116
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,490
it's a big thing in special forces
community.

117
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:23,241
We're real tight.
You know,

118
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:28,010
like I'm handing him my brother that has
bullet holes in him and,

119
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,360
and um,
and I'm like,

120
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:30,380
I don't want to let him go.
And he's like,

121
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:31,191
Hey,
I got this.

122
00:05:31,191 --> 00:05:33,440
This is what I do.
You go do what you're supposed to do and

123
00:05:33,441 --> 00:05:35,780
get back to work.
That was the last time I saw this dude

124
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:40,130
was handing him my buddy on a medivac.
Then I'm walking out of the cage.

125
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,600
I was like,
Holy Shit,

126
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,650
there is that dude from the one 60th
that I handed my shot buddy to.

127
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,070
Totally overwhelming.
I have to go in there and fight and then

128
00:05:49,071 --> 00:05:50,280
uh,
you know,

129
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,850
Nice Fifth Special Forces group is co
located there.

130
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:56,450
So I saw a bunch of dudes from like the
Green Baret regiment.

131
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,100
Yeah.
It was entirely

132
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,500
too much emotion.
I just want to be like curl up and cry.

133
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,260
Yeah.
It's a completely different kind of,

134
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,950
there's you on top of the cage up there
in that,

135
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,140
that photo.
That's just an intense,

136
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,110
intense picture.
That picture should be framed and on

137
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:12,170
your wall somewhere because that is one
of the greatest pictures of every scene.

138
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,030
And you could cut me out and just have
the dude.

139
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,511
No,
no,

140
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:14,901
no,
no,

141
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:16,730
no.
You need to be in there for reference.

142
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:17,661
Yeah,
I mean,

143
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:19,490
but that's your attitude.
What you just said,

144
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:22,610
cut me out and leave the dude's that
there really is your attitude.

145
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:25,070
You,
you really don't want that.

146
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,140
You,
you were saying while you were up there

147
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:30,020
that my job is,
is in here is easy.

148
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:32,120
What you guys do,
you guys are my heroes.

149
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,440
Yup.
You know,

150
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,341
memory.
Yeah.

151
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:35,810
I remember everything.
