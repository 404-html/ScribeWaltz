1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,500
Do Do, do, do, do, do
five, four, three, two,

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,650
one, boom and bird live.
Mark Della [inaudible] Hey,

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,400
what up?

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,890
Most of the time if you and I are talking
on a microphone and it's when you're

5
00:00:12,891 --> 00:00:14,980
in the truck and I'm
talking to you and you know,

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,560
and like right before a big fight,
people don't realize like you're,

7
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:21,950
you're the guy I talked to. Yeah. Man.
A lot of shit. Talking to a lot of shit.

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,500
A lot of things that we
probably shouldn't say.

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,210
Luckily it doesn't make the broadcast.
When that one got leaked,

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,500
when Aldo was about to fight Conor
and I said, he does not look good.

11
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,180
I said he looks nervous as fuck cargo.
His body looks flat. Often flat. Yeah.

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,980
And then you got flatlined.
Yeah, we'll, yeah, you right.
I was right in that regard.

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,860
That did make program,
didn't it? Well, people,

14
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:51,170
what happened was somebody recorded it
because a, I was talking to you I think,

15
00:00:51,171 --> 00:00:55,280
and I was talking to
Bruce and um, it just, uh,

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,280
somebody just decided to be a
little twat. Dude, that shit,

17
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,290
I know it in that truck.

18
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:04,100
Sometimes you have to be now wrong
fucking button and I'm going to be talking

19
00:01:04,101 --> 00:01:09,080
shit to you or matter. And I said,
well, that was one where, um, was uh,

20
00:01:09,081 --> 00:01:13,310
it was interesting. I was like, oh,
okay, well somebody's fucking asshole.

21
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,060
Like you're,

22
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,060
you're privy to this sort of inside
banter to like to release that like,

23
00:01:19,101 --> 00:01:21,410
and make it public.
I would never say that publicly.

24
00:01:21,411 --> 00:01:25,370
So I was very upset that they did that.
But it was honest now here, right.

25
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,480
It was honest. He did look like shit,
but damn, he looked good last weekend.

26
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:34,130
He looked on unbelievable crazy man. I
let to ask before. I love Jeremy Stevens.

27
00:01:34,131 --> 00:01:37,630
Great Guy. I mean, you know, we called
everybody worked for the company.

28
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,290
You've got to get to know everybody.
You gotta be cool to everybody.

29
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:43,970
But it was good to see you Jose Aldo back
on top, man. He needed that bad dude.

30
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,170
Well,
when someone ever,

31
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:48,390
I'm always happy when someone
live wins with a liver shot. Oh.

32
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,230
Because it's such a,
it's one of those weird punches.

33
00:01:51,231 --> 00:01:56,231
Like you'll see someone will see two
guys and they exchange good shots to the

34
00:01:56,751 --> 00:01:59,510
body and they seem like they
have no effect. You know,

35
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,630
obviously they hurt but they'll
deal with it and keep fighting.

36
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:07,870
And then every now and then you see whap
and then he see that liver shot where

37
00:02:07,881 --> 00:02:09,620
the legs go out and the body gives in.

38
00:02:09,621 --> 00:02:14,621
It's like man that is crazy that we
have this one area that sometimes works.

39
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,520
Yep. Cause sometimes it doesn't work
right. That's right. Liver shots,

40
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:22,950
weird man. And it's delayed.
That's the funniest part about it.

41
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:24,760
There's like a split second delay way.

42
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,490
Like I got this fold
over if you saw that too,

43
00:02:28,491 --> 00:02:30,710
like there was a body
shot that that he threw,

44
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:34,290
he threw like a rear right hand to
the body and then the left level shot.

45
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,020
So I think it's Kinda like,
you know,

46
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:39,740
you take the first punch and then you
brace and you got it and then you relax

47
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:42,010
for a second and that's when bullying,
gang,

48
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,920
diaphragm and you'll live as that's
vibrating. I wish it made sense.

49
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,890
Like here it is right here. We
can see it again. Weird video.

50
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,220
She throws the right
hand to the body first.

51
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,500
Okay.

52
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,710
What was he got there? It is and there
it is. Oh, gobble body shot. Yeah.

53
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,040
In Jeremy's a bang,

54
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,780
a two man,
that's a tough dude man.

55
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:06,520
To get dropped from a body shop and
to make that face to hurt so bad.

56
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:11,620
Well Kevin Ross is the only guy that
I've ever seen hide it. Kevin Ross got,

57
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,250
he was fighting in
Beltour not as last fight,

58
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,670
but maybe the previous fight.
And uh,

59
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,810
he got hit in the first round with a
spinning back kick right in the liver and

60
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:25,270
he just felt like, yes, yes.

61
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,530
He just kept moving and he said he
was an ultimate agony. Absolutely.

62
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,650
But he didn't show shit
and his opponent did. No,

63
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,980
I mean he really pulled it off.
He really pulled it off.

64
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:39,980
He figured out how to just,
he's so mentally strong though.

65
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,080
That guy crazy.

66
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,550
He just figured out how to suck
it up and just deal with the pain.

67
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,250
Tough to do and kickboxing and boxing too
because it's not like you can jump God

68
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:51,520
or stall a cry. Yeah. You can't
hide that. You know, you get,

69
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,320
you get hit like that and
you've got to keep fighting.

70
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,100
It's especially kickboxing as opposed
to Moitai. You can't even really clench.

71
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,990
Right, exactly. Especially
with these New Orleans.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,600
What do you like that do you like? Oh, I
don't like it. It's not the art, you know,

73
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,730
I think everything that's going
on, you know, with, you know,

74
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,270
these new rules came even when k one
first came out and all that kind of like

75
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:13,150
what I consider like a, a takeoff
of Muay Thai. It's not my type,

76
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:15,560
but they call it moy. Tai. Yeah. I
mean it's not more tight, you know,

77
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:20,170
it's not the real art. K One was like the
Japanese said, not enough brain damage,

78
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,780
not enough.
You need more brain damage.

79
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:24,700
And I think they just
suck that the clench,

80
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,850
which cut the ties are so good at it and
they wanted to give themselves a chance

81
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,520
to actually compete with like some of
the best in the world. So they said,

82
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,960
all right, let's limit
their weapons. Let's,

83
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,170
isn't that interesting because wouldn't
you think that they would just learn the

84
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:38,170
clinch? Man, I wish they would. You know,

85
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:40,750
that's one of the most intricate
parts of Moitai. It's one of,

86
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,180
that's where all the gambling goes.
That's where all the points come from.

87
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,150
Can Punch the shit out of somebody
and you get nowhere and then you start

88
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:49,630
clenching and then east.com and in
the little turnovers and trips ties.

89
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:51,760
Love that shit man. That's
that. That's the real art.

90
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,400
There's so much grappling involved in
Thai box and that's overlooked, you know,

91
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,860
into, into, to have rules that take
away grappling. Takeaway clinch work.

92
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,320
It makes no sense to me.
It's half the art at that point.

93
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:07,350
It's also a really underappreciated
thing in terms of like how they score it.

94
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,200
Like we don't,
we don't score the same way.

95
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,220
Like if you're watching a Thai
fight and if you were an American,

96
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:18,190
you can go cause a bunch of hugging.
Yeah, you got off a couple of needs,

97
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:20,530
but the other guy hit him with some
good right hands and a good jab.

98
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,460
So it's funny you say that. I just had
this lesson, my students the other night,

99
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,570
you know, doing uh, let's talk about the
rules, how to, how to win the judges,

100
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:29,351
so to say.
You know,

101
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:33,090
and the Dutch rules are different than
the Thai rules in America is kind of

102
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,740
fucked up and lost in between
all of it. You know, like the,

103
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,310
the Dutch consider like a hand block,
like a,

104
00:05:38,311 --> 00:05:41,530
if you block with your hands like this,
it's a block in Holland.

105
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,790
The ties that's not a block. That's a
point. Like you get the point, you know,

106
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,120
really? Yeah man. It's different.

107
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:48,970
You have to block with your legs and
tie box in order to show that you've

108
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:49,471
blocked in,

109
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:54,430
nullified the attack and the points
like the punches ScoreBig and Holland,

110
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,040
low kick score big and they mean shit
to the ties. You could punch the shit

111
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,210
out of somebody for full round and
then just get to clean body kicks off.

112
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:05,450
And then all the ties like, oh, hey,
you got that again, once starts going.

113
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,930
So a lot of these foreigners go to
Thailand and they think they're doing well

114
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:10,580
and then they lose decisions
and they wonder why.

115
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,850
It's because they don't
understand the judgment.

116
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,760
You don't understand the
rules and vice versa.

117
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:16,350
And the ties go to Holland
and you know, they, they,

118
00:06:16,351 --> 00:06:18,680
they think they're doing well and the
guy's punching the shit out of them and

119
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:21,470
then they kind of block in partially
and then they lose decisions as well.

120
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,640
So it's very different between the
judging and the scoring between Dutch

121
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:29,570
kickboxing in, in real
Moitai very different. Yeah.

122
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:35,010
I remember when Ramon Decker was fighting
over in Thailand and one of the things

123
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:39,870
that he shocked a lot of those guys
was with his, uh, his hand techniques.

124
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,330
Yup.

125
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:45,330
And he was able to close the distance
and just unleash a barrage of explosive

126
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,600
knockout punches and take guys out where
I think they'd become more accustomed

127
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:52,830
to that not happening.
Very true.

128
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,870
It also become accustomed to not
being assaulted in the first round.

129
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,240
Very much so. I remember one of the fights
I had early in my career in Thailand,

130
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,530
I was so excited to be fighting at a big
fan of big festival fighting this big

131
00:07:05,531 --> 00:07:08,740
name ty. And I threw an elbow
on the first round, you know,

132
00:07:08,741 --> 00:07:11,600
and I kind of had the opportunity to
throw the elbow through the elbow and you

133
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:13,430
know, I landed and the
guy wiped his, you know,

134
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,640
put his glove up to his head
to see if he was bleeding.

135
00:07:15,641 --> 00:07:19,060
And he gave me that mean look and
nodded and it was game on from there.

136
00:07:19,061 --> 00:07:21,940
And I went back to the corner and my
tie trainers are yelling at me like the

137
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:25,780
fuck are you doing? You throw, I
was like, elbows illegal. Yeah,

138
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:27,910
but not first round now he angry at you.
I was like,

139
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:30,490
what the fuck did he angry you?

140
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,310
Tigerfish halftime having a bad dude.

141
00:07:33,311 --> 00:07:36,550
It was apparently I was just excited
to be fighting in Thailand using elbows

142
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:37,840
cause a lot of times in the states,
you know,

143
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:39,610
we can't use them and
the rules are limited.

144
00:07:39,611 --> 00:07:42,220
And I was in Thailand and
it was a festival at night.

145
00:07:42,221 --> 00:07:45,520
And the fucking lights are on and the
ties of baton and I was like, game on,

146
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:48,250
let's go. The train isn't mad
at me for throwing the elbow.

147
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,560
And then there was other fights
where I had where they were like, Oh,

148
00:07:50,561 --> 00:07:54,820
be careful for elbow this festival fight.
No doctor here hospital far away.

149
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,410
It's like you guys have fucking my
head. All of them. The other doctor,

150
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:03,940
he far away, I remember my train of saying
that, he's like, be careful for elbow.

151
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:07,090
I was like, thanks fucking tips. Like I
know watch over her elbows. He's like,

152
00:08:07,091 --> 00:08:11,610
yeah but no doctor. Yeah, not
stadium. This fest. Devo hospital,

153
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,390
long p band.

154
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:17,260
Oh Wally [inaudible] you get such
a good [inaudible] is on point bro.

155
00:08:17,261 --> 00:08:20,520
Don't even go there. The only
thing can go there. So we make,

156
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,130
we do a lady boy heavy Boston accent dude,
Debbie.

157
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,910
Debbie is stitched her and speak tied,
stitched it some rnr and uh,

158
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,570
in the service like in a, in
Thailand and man like, you know,

159
00:08:31,571 --> 00:08:34,270
you see like so what the hell? That's
like the property. He's like, man,

160
00:08:34,271 --> 00:08:38,080
it's still what the cup he likes. Speaks
like a tie. That's hilarious dude.

161
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,770
It's the funniest thing.
Then how do you say thank you again?

162
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:46,720
Cup Cop Capcom Cup code. Yeah. If
you roll the R's, it's like real,

163
00:08:46,721 --> 00:08:48,630
like almost like a risk
of craddle like you just,

164
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:52,000
you stick out like a sore thumb. If
you're a white dude, women don't say that.

165
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:56,210
They say cup, coon, CRA car.
Her car, like the feminine,

166
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,170
Polite Particle X.

167
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:01,350
I will say so cop like crop and it
looks like Krup but it's actually a cup.

168
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:06,240
That's the, the male play protocol
and then in everybody, ah,

169
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,830
[inaudible] stretch everything
out. Everything is like, oh,

170
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:11,723
I go with you.

171
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,190
It's just like,
I don't know,

172
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:21,540
it's the Twang I guess is that tie to
Ang did the nicest people on earth this

173
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,380
week as sweeter. So nice man. Not
all of them. It's the land of smiles,

174
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:27,210
but you'll find some fucking
frowns here and there.

175
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:30,820
I'll tell you how much to the course
who, especially in the fight game. Yeah,

176
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,820
there's no getting around the fight game.

177
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,020
You're going to have some mean
motherfuckers. Very true. But the, the,

178
00:09:36,021 --> 00:09:38,250
the fighters are cool though,
man. I remember my first,

179
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,500
one of my first fights in Thailand,

180
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,690
well at least my Roger dominant and
fight in 2003 I had breakfast with my

181
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:45,420
opponent and it was like real
super. Yeah, super chill.

182
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:48,630
Like we weighed in but naked next to
each other, which was awkward as fuck.

183
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:52,200
But like we really have to be
naked and the ties like, yeah,

184
00:09:52,201 --> 00:09:55,350
you got to get down bro. And I was like,
I don't want to get naked. I'm on wait,

185
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,140
don't worry, I'll eat. They're
like, no underwear off.

186
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,330
That's how we do it at Roger Down
in San Diego. And I was like, shit,

187
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,980
but naked way to my opponent.

188
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,450
Went next door and had breakfast with
him shooting the shit. But it is,

189
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,390
it is a cool place, man. I remember
the first time I went to Thailand,

190
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,870
I came home and I was homesick and I
was fucked up. Dude. It felt weird.

191
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:16,770
I was like, I felt like lonely and loss
and I had family here. Like, you know,

192
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:19,920
I was, I was with my, currently my
wife now, I was with her at the time.

193
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:22,920
We weren't married at the time, but you
know, I was, I had family, I had friends,

194
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:26,370
I was very much connected, you know, old
school, Sicilian family, Boston base,

195
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:29,520
you know, deep roots and I
just felt awkward and weird.

196
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,710
I was like away from home and I
was like homesick. You Ms. Tyler.

197
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,080
I missed Thailand my very first trip.

198
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:37,740
I remember leaving the airport and I
was driving and I had nothing but smiles

199
00:10:37,741 --> 00:10:41,250
for like a month and a half straight and
I was leaving Logan Airport in Boston

200
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:44,310
and some truck Jabba cut me off and
stuck his head out to where it's like,

201
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,610
fuck you man.
Gave me the fear to chill,

202
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,830
like wanting to go out and
fight. And I was like, Bro,

203
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:52,560
I'll snap your neck but I don't want
to fight nobody. Like I'm Buddha now.

204
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:56,220
Like I like, I like this vibe and we go
back to Thailand. Like it was weird man.

205
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,980
It was definitely trippy though. But
something brought me something very deep.

206
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,730
Lake and spiritual brought me to Thailand.
Brought me to the guys though.

207
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,550
The opposite way I feel about Boston.
When I go back to Boston, I see hostility.

208
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:13,230
I got my smile on my God,
I remember this right,

209
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:17,370
and people copy blow off.
You fucking quit. Oh yeah.

210
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:20,860
So this is where I grew up.
It has always been,

211
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,940
there's something unique about Boston
people that man, I told you, man,

212
00:11:23,941 --> 00:11:24,870
I've told this to people.
Like,

213
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:28,650
you know when you got to get up at
fucking six in the morning to shovel 17

214
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:31,890
inches of snow off your fucking frozen
windshield and go to work and sit in

215
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:35,460
traffic and beep and be angry at each
other, like just makes a different person,

216
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,670
you know, definitely makes a
different sense of humor for sure.

217
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:44,130
There's a certain connection that I
have to those northeast comedians. Yeah,

218
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,130
guys like Bill Burr.
Like we bill an,

219
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:50,250
I did a show Wednesday night and it's like
whatever. We're out a guy from Boston,

220
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:54,040
it's like, it's so obvious. It's
like there's a certain end is

221
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,610
also a certain respect for
people's attention span very much.

222
00:11:57,611 --> 00:12:00,340
This is one of the good things about
starting out in Boston was like,

223
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,840
people didn't give a fuck.

224
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,660
Like they don't have any time
for your dilly dallying up there.

225
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,710
You better come with the jokes.

226
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,670
[inaudible] first trip to la on
now was the La San Francisco,

227
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:13,360
I think at the time when I was younger,
when it's like some random sandwich shop,

228
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,660
I think I'm hungry. I was like, give
me one of those giants right there.

229
00:12:15,661 --> 00:12:17,650
And the guy like was taking
his time and I was like, Bro,

230
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:21,160
I'm gonna fucking Russian Lake. And my
buddy was like, dude, watch the f bombs.

231
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:23,260
I was like, what do you mean?
He's like, just watch you have on.

232
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:26,320
So the guy comes out with a sandwich
and was his little fucking peanut half

233
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:29,260
sandwich. I go, what the fuck am I
gonna do with that? And he's like,

234
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,350
I'm sorry like to, and I was like,
where's the other half? And he's like,

235
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,100
that's it sir. And I was like, Bro, I
need another fucking sandwich. He's like,

236
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,700
I'm going to have to charge you
for it. And I was like, charge me,

237
00:12:39,701 --> 00:12:41,410
do whatever you gotta do,
Bro. I'm fucking hungry.

238
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:45,040
Like literally everybody behind me in
line just out of disperse and it'll like

239
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:48,670
left the store. And my buddy
was like, Bro, I can't take
you anywhere around. Yeah,

240
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,890
it was how many years back then?
Probably maybe 2020 years old,

241
00:12:53,891 --> 00:12:55,810
maybe Tennessee.
That's a different mark.

242
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:58,450
Della grotty and a different
San Francisco. Very true.

243
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:03,430
San Francisco was like
super calm lefty back then.

244
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:05,080
Now San Francisco's different.

245
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:09,830
San Francisco is homeless people
projectile shitting into the streets.

246
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:10,664
So yeah,

247
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:15,690
I didn't actually expensive real
estate and Tech Tech Dorks who uh,

248
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:20,860
speak and they have a specific language
in San Francisco. Ray Little, yeah,

249
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:23,770
it's called up speak.
Is that a fact? Yeah.

250
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,200
This is how I describe it as a language,

251
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:29,530
but tech people in San Francisco and if
you're a tech person in San Francisco

252
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:34,000
and you do this, stop it. As they do this,

253
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,050
they talk like here's the deal.

254
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:43,140
Like what we're trying to do with
our start up at the end of all,

255
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:46,900
you know the car at the car at the time,

256
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,080
San Francisco, San Francisco's
version of that and it's up speeding.

257
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,660
Everything at the end goes.
Uh,

258
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,380
so what we're trying to,
and what it is is like they're faking it.

259
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:04,630
They're trying to like when you want to
pretend to be intelligent or tech savvy

260
00:14:04,631 --> 00:14:08,200
or in,
and it's a very left wing thing to it.

261
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,620
So it's only people who are super
liberal and super progressive.

262
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:15,940
Like you can't say it. You couldn't
talk like that and go Donald Trump,

263
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,900
although he's problematic, has some
really good points in regards to business.

264
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,220
Like you couldn't say that Bro,
please stop.

265
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,500
He was a lot of good enough,

266
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,840
a lot of good combat sports come out
of San Francisco. Absolutely man.

267
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:30,750
I think about like the,

268
00:14:30,751 --> 00:14:35,751
the history of like you got the Gracie
Gracie Baha contingent up there.

269
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:40,840
You know how if Gracie is got one of the,
like northern California,

270
00:14:40,841 --> 00:14:45,540
the bay area areas,
Dave terrail,

271
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,260
the Diaz brothers, obviously Cesar Gracie.
Yup. And then you had an Alex Gong.

272
00:14:50,261 --> 00:14:52,010
He used to be up there
just going to say the fair

273
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,820
tech's crew, that old school fair tech
school. Alex Gong Johnson unfair techs.

274
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:59,270
Did they ever catch the guy who killed
him? Yeah, I think he killed himself.

275
00:14:59,271 --> 00:15:03,020
Actually, no, Alex Gong
got killed in a, someone,

276
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:07,640
someone did something and he went out
like someone would fuck with his car or

277
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:10,880
something like that and somebody
outside and someone murdered him.

278
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,990
The way I heard it was he was training
to the gym and somebody sideswiped or hit

279
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:16,570
his car or something like that.

280
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,490
He ran down the street after him
in a pair of fucking boxing gloves,

281
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:20,900
which probably wasn't,
you know,

282
00:15:20,901 --> 00:15:24,710
I mean obviously you see some fucking
savage running appeal window boxing gloves

283
00:15:24,711 --> 00:15:26,990
on. So the guy shot him. Yeah.

284
00:15:26,991 --> 00:15:30,620
But I think the guy had some mental
history and he was like, you know,

285
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:33,140
he was unstable or something like that.
From what I understood,

286
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:37,420
I thought the guy actually committed
suicide is suspect. Yup. You're right.

287
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,980
Suspect that killed.
So shooting killed himself.

288
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,290
That was fucked up man. What uh, what,
uh, uh, a waste though, huh? Yeah.

289
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,560
Got crashed into a parked
car. So he chafed after it
is. Yeah. I didn't know that.

290
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,000
It was making shit up for a minute
though. Not Man. That's sad man.

291
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:55,100
He was a great fighter man.
I remember watching like number,

292
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:58,940
like I ask like kickbox and back in the
day when like the fair tech's crew from

293
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:02,260
Chandler, Arizona, who's the big icon,

294
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,840
Yow Johnson fair tax and a
fair tax was you got the guy,

295
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:09,860
I was the smaller guy too. I forget
his name, I'm drawing a blank.

296
00:16:09,861 --> 00:16:12,530
But that whole fair tech's crew man
back in the day, man, they just,

297
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,180
they came from Thailand and just fucking
threw up like this aluminum building

298
00:16:17,181 --> 00:16:18,110
and Chandler,

299
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:22,700
Arizona in the desert and just started
fucking flying people in to fucking learn

300
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:24,740
when we tie and they were kicking ass.
Dude,

301
00:16:24,741 --> 00:16:28,400
they kicked everybody's ass back in the
day that Iska kickbox and scene. Well,

302
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:29,900
when you started fighting,

303
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:35,080
there were very few people that were
like formerly trained in Muay Thai in our

304
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:38,000
area,
in the Boston area.

305
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:43,130
Like we knew a rich vast
Poli. Oh Man. What a name.

306
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,790
He died in the triathlon
to kicked in the head,

307
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,630
but he was swimming and during that crazy,

308
00:16:48,631 --> 00:16:50,540
he's crazy man of all the
shit you did and your life.

309
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,930
You've fucking got kicked by a swimmer and
drown. Yeah. And he was like, you know,

310
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:57,050
all it was done fighting. It was
in his 40 [inaudible]. Exactly.

311
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,300
He was chilling at the time.
So I need to say that, man,

312
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:02,120
because back in the day I thought
about this coming out here, you know,

313
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:05,570
I remember the, the first pair of Moy
Thai shorts, I saw her like, dude,

314
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:08,630
that's funky. Those, those we had
led us on the front leg and it was a,

315
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,300
I don't you remember a
guy named Ed Babylock,

316
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:15,070
I think his name was Kim Mkhize and
Australia. He was a sig aton guy too. He,

317
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,990
but yeah, man. He was like, you
know, I remember back in the day,

318
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:22,460
he was one of the first guys in the area
to have a pair of Moy Thai shorts and

319
00:17:22,461 --> 00:17:25,910
he was training with Deena Rosenblatt,
Joel and, but that whole crew,

320
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,760
it's funny because we have similar
backgrounds in martial arts in terms of

321
00:17:28,761 --> 00:17:32,420
Boston. It was the only legit
into each other back then.

322
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:34,670
But I think you were a little
bit ahead of me at the time.

323
00:17:34,671 --> 00:17:38,360
I think that was the general Shapley
on my way out to when I was starting to

324
00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:40,180
train with Joe Lake.
Um,

325
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,400
I started training with Joe Lake
when I was teaching and revere.

326
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,210
I was teaching it, not yes, the
code is, and we on that joint. Yeah.

327
00:17:48,211 --> 00:17:50,100
So I was teaching this teaching

328
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,070
taekwondo there.
Um,

329
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:57,220
I w Joe Lake was lifting weights
over there and Joe Lake, uh,

330
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,880
came in, he started, we had
heavy bags and the whole set up.

331
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:04,260
And then he started talking to me
and asking me questions. And, uh,

332
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,980
we made a deal where he would teach me
how to box and I would teach him how to

333
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:12,030
kick. And so he came
over and we started, uh,

334
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,650
doing some, um, you know, submit
work and doing some things.

335
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:19,320
Then I started working with him and
Dana Rosenblatt and Dana was only,

336
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,800
he was in high school at the time I
went to Malden Catholic with, yeah,

337
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,570
I think I was 20 and I
think Dana was 18, 17, 18,

338
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:30,100
something like that. Began his career
as a kickboxer. That's right. Again,

339
00:18:30,101 --> 00:18:30,451
it's crazy.

340
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:33,030
Kickboxer and there was no money in it
and he was doing well with his hands.

341
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:37,680
So I told him to stop kickboxing and
he convinced me to stop fighting,

342
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:44,130
sparring each other and he went on to sell
real estate. Now he's like successful,

343
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:49,230
really successful boxing career too.
He stopped Teri Norris.

344
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,320
That's right. He, um, who's the guy
who used to be the boxing coach?

345
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:56,740
Howard Davis Jr. He stopped
him. I remember him. He used
a boxing coach at att. Yup.

346
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,150
I know John took her. He beat some
good guys. He beats him real good.

347
00:19:00,151 --> 00:19:03,720
Five's a southpaw too, wasn't
it? Yeah, he's a tough kid.

348
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,210
But he also came up,
you know,

349
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,930
one of the things that I've said about,
uh,

350
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:15,140
one of the things that I learned from
my kickboxing training was how dangerous

351
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:20,010
it is to meet heads bar. And all
we did was meatheads. That's,

352
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,840
I mean it started off with like, you know,
me and my brother would like, you know,

353
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:27,390
hockey helmets in hockey
gloves and try that out.

354
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:30,020
And then little by little it
was like, I right. You know,

355
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,820
get into a gym and stopped boxing.
Man.

356
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:35,850
I remember the first time I went to a
boxing gym and like the Boston area, man,

357
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:39,900
it was on back then you went to a boxing
gym and I remember literally like my

358
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:43,020
coach said, sent me up the spine, it
like a boxing club. He's like, all right,

359
00:19:43,021 --> 00:19:45,970
you realize like you're the new guy.
I was like, yeah. He says that man,

360
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,810
they all know each other.
They don't know you like yeah,

361
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,860
you've got a big target on your back.
And I remember like the night before,

362
00:19:52,861 --> 00:19:55,680
like I would go spa like felt like a fight
and I was like, yeah, I'm in a fight.

363
00:19:55,681 --> 00:19:59,610
And I'd get to the gym and it was
on dude back then it was like,

364
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,260
it was extremely unintelligent, you know.
But that's, we were cavemen at the time.

365
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:05,910
That's all we knew. I remember, you know,

366
00:20:05,911 --> 00:20:08,310
there were holes in the walls
that like rich, vast, the police,

367
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,600
different people get knocked back in
the sheet rock was kicked out the sheet

368
00:20:12,601 --> 00:20:16,350
rock. You're crazy man. We didn't know
any better though at the time I started,

369
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,350
I knew a rich vast Poli from Dana.

370
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,040
I became friends with Dana and we started
training together and then we would

371
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,900
sometimes train over at richest place.

372
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:29,190
And that was when I got introduced into
Moy Tai Cause one of Dana's friends had

373
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:32,970
uh, gone to Thailand and he had done
some training over there and come back.

374
00:20:32,971 --> 00:20:36,600
And that's when I realized
like how effective leg kicks,

375
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:40,080
where like I'd never been leg
kicked before except by accident.

376
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:44,280
And then once I realized like
shins to thigh, like what,

377
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,980
how much damage that does and how
easy it was to, that happened to me.

378
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:50,620
One was how easy it was for
me to get punched in the face.

379
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,380
And that was when I first met from a
traditional martial arts background.

380
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,100
Taekwondo.

381
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,920
Taekwondo was so delusional because
you often taekwondo as well too.

382
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,340
You couldn't punch to the face,

383
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:04,180
so you had a very distorted perception
of what you could get away with in a

384
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:06,040
fight where there was no rules.

385
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,030
You just had this real and so one
of the same reality check. Yeah.

386
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,150
So boxing alone was not good.

387
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:15,880
Kickboxing was better because
I could create some distance,

388
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:20,470
but it was still way easier than I
liked to get punched in the face.

389
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:25,150
But then Moitai was a big one because
the moment you take that first leg kick

390
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:28,720
and you feel that thud and you're like,
oh shit,

391
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,110
this is that easy.
It's that easy to diminish me.

392
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,810
Like almost instantaneously
you're diminished.

393
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:38,890
I feel it. As you're talking about
it. I took a low kick from Peter Arts.

394
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,400
No, and oddly enough, a, another
trip was, uh, was it, um,

395
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:47,400
he drove his, oh no, he
might be the worst. And you,

396
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,120
I thought my femur
fucking cracked in half.

397
00:21:50,121 --> 00:21:53,300
Never felt pain like that from
a pay Peter or, or from Pedro?

398
00:21:53,301 --> 00:21:56,330
Both at different times.
Pedroza the scariest guy I've ever seen.

399
00:21:56,331 --> 00:21:59,690
Kick kicker back. I've never seen anybody
kicked her bag so hard. I agree man.

400
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,730
I trained with him a little bit
in Thailand back in the day.

401
00:22:01,731 --> 00:22:04,460
We used to train at a gym called ISS,
which was like a,

402
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,680
a takeoff of like sick aton like a,

403
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,810
we sold some fighters and some trainers
to a friend of Korea tongs. And uh,

404
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:15,820
we would train on the roof
of this building on Lake
Sukham vit highway in like

405
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:20,000
the sun. What like a canopy like above us.
It was pretty, pretty, uh, pretty rough.

406
00:22:20,001 --> 00:22:23,510
But Peter Arts was their training
at the time. And Pedro, his, Oh,

407
00:22:23,511 --> 00:22:27,210
came through there and I mean I was a lot
smaller than them obviously, but Jude,

408
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,340
why did this, why'd you spar with
them anyway? Because I'm retarded.

409
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:35,180
Stupid. Cause there's the
opportunity man. They were like,

410
00:22:35,181 --> 00:22:37,330
oh we need guys and I was
actually helping someone else,

411
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:41,270
another one of my stablemates get ready
and he just happened to be there and

412
00:22:41,271 --> 00:22:43,130
he's like, Oh man, let's move
around a little bit. And I was like,

413
00:22:43,131 --> 00:22:45,710
this is probably not a good idea, but
it's an honor. You know what I mean?

414
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:50,360
So I'm partially proud of getting
kicked in the leg by those guys. But I,

415
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,080
I probably shit have done that dude.
What's worse though nowadays it,

416
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:58,030
you seize that calf kicks more damage
from those man. I'm telling you,

417
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,470
I'll still meet down there road.

418
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:04,280
I'll take the kicks all day long on the
thigh now man, those 10 debt tender area,

419
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:06,650
like I remember losing
a fight in Thailand.

420
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,480
I didn't really have an
extensive career as a fight,

421
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:10,490
but I did have some quality
fights and that will vary.

422
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,510
That were valuable lessons to me. And I
remember I was blocking wrong, you know,

423
00:23:14,511 --> 00:23:14,891
the whole fee.

424
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:18,110
Every time he low kicked I would block
and I would take it right with a calf kit

425
00:23:18,111 --> 00:23:21,530
goes like on the low part of the Shin.
And I was pointing my toes down.

426
00:23:21,531 --> 00:23:23,780
It's always controversy of toes down,
toes up.

427
00:23:23,781 --> 00:23:27,860
I always teach toes up to flex the Shin
Muscle to flex the muscle around the

428
00:23:27,861 --> 00:23:32,720
shin bone. And, um, I was blocking
wrong and I'll never forget that man.

429
00:23:32,721 --> 00:23:35,990
I was bed ridden from
blocking kicks the wrong way.

430
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,790
And it was that same area with
this, like you said, there's no,

431
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:41,150
how long were you bedridden for?
Two weeks probably.

432
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,880
I remember like trying to go to lake,
it was in Thailand.

433
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:46,100
I came back from Thailand.
Dude was a rough flight

434
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,870
like oh awesome, great. Lots of
pain medication for that flight.

435
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,110
But uh, I remember literally like after
some of the fights like that I've had,

436
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,070
you know,

437
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:58,430
I was literally bedridden like couldn't
go to like family barbecues and shit.

438
00:23:58,431 --> 00:23:59,810
Like just like, dude, I can't get up.

439
00:23:59,811 --> 00:24:03,740
I get a lot of those kicks in the UFC
that we've seen emerge over the last few

440
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,870
years and I always give
credit to Benson Henderson.

441
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,550
So being the first guy to start doing it.

442
00:24:07,551 --> 00:24:11,450
It's funny you say that because I threw
a lay up to Anik like the last show and

443
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:14,750
I was like, oh, but maybe we
might get and it's like, yeah,

444
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:15,710
I'm not mentioning that name.

445
00:24:15,711 --> 00:24:20,660
Like Benson Henderson for photos
over and bell. Correct. I mean,

446
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:25,450
it is what it is, you know?
That's crazy. That's so crazy.

447
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,380
You gotta give it up. I said it. I
said, man, you know, just a quick tip,

448
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:31,790
like a little fun fact.
You know,

449
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:34,100
Benson Henderson is the guy that
really kicked that off, you know,

450
00:24:34,101 --> 00:24:37,220
for lack of a better term. And he's
like, yeah, copy that. I was like,

451
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,330
I'm not gonna mention that name. I was
like, all right, cool. Respect. I get it.

452
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:46,280
I get it. You gotta do what you gotta
do in this world. He was exactly,

453
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,010
we got to eat. You know,
he was the first though,

454
00:24:49,011 --> 00:24:53,390
but he doesn't have the same effectiveness
for whatever reason that these guys

455
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,090
do now. Um, there's,

456
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:59,090
there's guys now that are doing it where
you see like one kick in the guys. Fuck.

457
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,150
Yup. Absolutely. And it's such a
lower risk for the take down too,

458
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:04,690
because you just, you're not traveling
that far. You know, the high you kicked,

459
00:25:04,691 --> 00:25:07,520
the more risk for the down
just seems awful. You know,

460
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:10,520
like the legs just to
immediately stop working. Right.

461
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,600
I've had a few of my athletes suffer
some serious trauma from those kicks and

462
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:18,290
fights. Man. It's not, you can't really
prep for those. You really can't. Like,

463
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:21,170
it's just all about managing distance,
you know, control on the range. Cause you,

464
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:25,820
you can't really check it. It's too low to
check, just condition it. No, not at all.

465
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,100
There's nothing to really do with
it other than just, like I said,

466
00:25:28,101 --> 00:25:31,430
you've got to manage distance properly.
So you just, either way in a way out.

467
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:35,300
But in that middle weight, like you
get kicked like that man out. Gee.

468
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:38,300
What are your thoughts on this?
Robert Whitaker kick,

469
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,960
I mean a call it the Robert Whitaker
kicked because Yoel Romero fucked him up

470
00:25:41,961 --> 00:25:44,390
with it and their first fight,
that side kick to the knee.

471
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:49,430
Oh you refer to it as John John. John's
really one of the first school. John.

472
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:52,340
It's actually illegal in some
commissions, right? Is it legal or not?

473
00:25:52,341 --> 00:25:55,160
I think it's illegal.
It's illegal in some,

474
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,280
some commissions don't allow it because
of the danger of like attacking the

475
00:25:58,281 --> 00:26:01,090
joint. I have a hard time
accepting that cause it's okay to,

476
00:26:01,091 --> 00:26:02,750
to attack your fucking face.

477
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,500
Why is it okay for me to kick you in
the face but it's not okay to for me to

478
00:26:06,501 --> 00:26:09,050
kick. Exactly. That doesn't make any
sense. Well they say that, you know,

479
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:12,550
and even in Thai boxing ticket, not so
supposed to deliberately attack the joint.

480
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:15,250
Yeah. John, there you go John.

481
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,950
It's actually w and g quinto
on the philosophy of Brucey.

482
00:26:18,951 --> 00:26:22,010
They believe they call it like it's a
Kung Fu kick. It's called the dumb tech,

483
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,950
I believe. Well the way a Winkle John
started teaching it and you know, we,

484
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,130
his students started doing it
was the oblique style. Yes.

485
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,690
But then they started doing
that sidekick style too.

486
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:37,250
Like that'll bleak style is very
interesting. Yeah. Was my face.

487
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,340
And I think that,
um,

488
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,160
in my opinion it's, it's, it's a super,

489
00:26:44,161 --> 00:26:46,680
super effective technique
and didn't take it out.

490
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:49,850
It doesn't make any sense to me if
you still allow heel hooks. Yeah.

491
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,390
And he's still allow,
I mean,

492
00:26:51,391 --> 00:26:54,150
especially since he allowed kicks
to the fucking head. Yeah, true.

493
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,580
And I'm a fan of the kick. You
know, I'm, I'm not against it.

494
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:00,030
I appreciate it that the,
one of the things I tell
fighters all the time is the,

495
00:27:00,031 --> 00:27:01,710
if y'all going to do anything,
if you're going to kick me,

496
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:03,630
if you're going to punch me, if you're
going to try to take me down anything,

497
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,200
the first thing you need to do is take
that step. What that lead leg. So if you,

498
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,750
and this is something Bruce Lee you
talked about in his art and philosophy,

499
00:27:09,751 --> 00:27:12,360
but there's always disruption
disrupting that lead leg,

500
00:27:12,361 --> 00:27:15,180
stopping that lead leg and the ties
use it all the time. A lot of times,

501
00:27:15,181 --> 00:27:17,700
you know that teeth, the front
kick, they Tepe the leg a lot.

502
00:27:17,701 --> 00:27:20,160
It's not always taught like a lot of,
a lot of people overlook it,

503
00:27:20,161 --> 00:27:21,990
but I'm a huge fan of
attack in that front leg.

504
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:24,180
Like keeping the front leg
side kick in the front leg.

505
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,240
So the first thing they need to do to
close this and says take that step. Well,

506
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:30,870
anything also to create another variable
that the fighters to think about as

507
00:27:30,871 --> 00:27:34,140
they're moving in stops. And I'm like,

508
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:38,040
the worst thing you could ever do with
a fighter is give them something that's

509
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:40,660
real clear and easy to plan for.
Yeah.

510
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,130
You do the same technique over and
over again. He can time it, you know,

511
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:46,920
the same predictable series of movements.
You can time it.

512
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,330
That's why I got like Dominick Cruz is
so difficult to deal with because Dominic

513
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,780
like good luck,
do shuffle in his left.

514
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:58,710
He variety from the hips and knees.
That's actually how my dad, oh,

515
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:02,100
he's so awkward that he has been,
but he makes it work for Frank Gay.

516
00:28:02,101 --> 00:28:05,160
Then the key thing with him to have
that and that it's difficult to do that

517
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:07,440
oblique kick or that that
front stop kick is, uh,

518
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,680
is the lateral movement and if you're
going straight in all the time and you're

519
00:28:10,681 --> 00:28:12,300
walking straight into that,
you're going to be susceptible.

520
00:28:12,301 --> 00:28:15,570
Dominic's always stepping off to the side,
but there's a lefty or righty.

521
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:18,990
He's always creating an angle
which is huge in combat.
You know, who does that? Oh,

522
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:23,190
oblique kick fucking better than
anybody. Lorens Larkin. Yes.

523
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,980
Lorens lark and throws
that shit to another body.

524
00:28:25,981 --> 00:28:30,000
Like a sidekick and since dude's flying,
I remember when he fought in Neil Magni.

525
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:34,680
Yes, I do. I was like, dude, he's
a stud. That guy, he's clean.

526
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,860
I watched him warm up.
I think he fought in the Boston show.

527
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,720
I think at the time I was training.
He throws that shit to the body, dude.

528
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,700
He's a stud man. I, you know, I don't,

529
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,550
I don't know why he wasn't as successful
as he could have been or should have

530
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:48,720
been.
Here's what happened.

531
00:28:48,721 --> 00:28:53,070
He went over to belt or and he
immediately fought lean. Okay.

532
00:28:53,071 --> 00:28:56,220
Lima's a fucking monster.
He loses a decision to Lima.

533
00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:01,370
Then he gets into s lug fast with Paul
motherfucking daily who might have the

534
00:29:01,921 --> 00:29:06,921
best left hook to world's ever
known name for MMA boxers,

535
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,680
base Plat.
That fucking left hook he's got,

536
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,270
it's just insane because I met
him back in the day. We used to,

537
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,100
I first time I went over to London,

538
00:29:14,101 --> 00:29:17,530
we did a show called La cage rage
and I took Jorge her very, very,

539
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:22,380
with this fight, this fight,
there's an Silva Silva.

540
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:26,670
We played that the other day. He was
just teeing off on them from the clinch.

541
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,910
Anderson is just taking one on the
chin. Want to hear a funny story? Yeah,

542
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:33,390
I see Anderson and all I can see it's
like George has got his back to me.

543
00:29:33,391 --> 00:29:34,410
Jorge's got us back to me.

544
00:29:34,411 --> 00:29:37,170
So He's have palm lane in there in the
center of the cage and they kind of in a

545
00:29:37,171 --> 00:29:41,770
tie, Clinton Georges throwing
vicious uppercuts, vicious apricots,

546
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,360
an overhand and upper cuts,

547
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,600
dirty box out thunder in his hands and
he's throwing like these big bombs over

548
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:52,000
the top. Everything in all I can
see because Georgia's backs to me,

549
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:55,240
I can't see Anderson's face. All I
can see is his head. Bobblin you know,

550
00:29:55,241 --> 00:29:58,210
taking the hits. I'm
like, yeah, go, go, go.

551
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,430
And then over Georgia shoulder
I see Anderson's face and
he's laughing at George.

552
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:07,270
I'm like fuck. And then he
just blitzed stone. He do that.

553
00:30:07,271 --> 00:30:11,040
Did he roll with them slightly? Like
what did he do, do it? I think it's,

554
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:14,140
it's all a matter of like, you know,
using your shoulders to protect impact,

555
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:15,760
you know, shrugging. And
so to say, the first,

556
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,780
first thing is bite the first
line of defense, bite down
second end of the fence,

557
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,520
brace your neck, you
know, and he just, yeah,

558
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:26,230
duty mean he's gonna fucking Pumpkin head.
He's got a big dome dude. Well, I mean,

559
00:30:26,231 --> 00:30:28,420
but you stop and think
about later in his career,

560
00:30:28,421 --> 00:30:29,920
he couldn't take those kinds of shots.

561
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,440
They add up after a while it
gets put back in the day. Man,

562
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:34,060
I remember coming into that,
you know,

563
00:30:34,061 --> 00:30:37,570
I had followed Moitai had followed
shoot box. I'd follow, you know,

564
00:30:37,571 --> 00:30:40,510
Palae those guys. So I knew Anderson
Silva, a lot of people like, oh,

565
00:30:40,511 --> 00:30:43,160
it was this guy, Anderson Silva, he's
coming over. A lot of people didn't know.

566
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,250
So I knew what we were getting into.
I knew what type of fight it was.

567
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:49,120
But the funny thing is when he
came to the UFC member, he debuted,

568
00:30:49,121 --> 00:30:53,380
I was there at the hard rock. The joint
is Chris leaving and everybody's like,

569
00:30:53,381 --> 00:30:55,810
oh dude, the bets. Like, I
was like, I saw the odds,

570
00:30:55,811 --> 00:30:59,580
I like the Mandela and I was like,
dude, I'm all over this. What was,

571
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:02,020
it was just some crazy, I forget
at the time, but like it was,

572
00:31:02,021 --> 00:31:05,860
they had Lieben in like, like being
like the favor. I was like, dude,

573
00:31:05,861 --> 00:31:10,240
nobody knows him. Like Johnson.
Yeah, I knew how to man.

574
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:13,650
I'm the Promo. One of the things I said
is you gotta be ready for this guide.

575
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:17,050
This is, this is a different animal. You
experienced the same with rich Franklin.

576
00:31:17,051 --> 00:31:21,490
Man, I riches my boy love you rich. But
you know, I bet the fucking house on that.

577
00:31:21,491 --> 00:31:24,430
And I did really well because the odds
were just everybody thought rich was just

578
00:31:24,431 --> 00:31:27,970
going to steam roll and you don't want
him to simply because rich was a stand up

579
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:31,570
fighter. Right. Primarily. And he had a
ground game and he was on top at the time.

580
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:33,130
I mean he was,
he was way on top,

581
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,610
but Anderson was just on a whole different
level coming into the mixed martial

582
00:31:36,611 --> 00:31:38,710
arts coming into the UFC.
He was just on a whole different level.

583
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,400
Especially the style of
the Chris Liebing hat. Yes.

584
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:46,150
Style was so perfectly tailored.
Exactly. Exactly. Walk forward.

585
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:50,560
Throw bombs. Anderson's like a
smooth retreating defensive fighter.

586
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,130
He's came from Thailand. Pretty
cool. Pretty Dope, right? Yeah.

587
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,800
The Chinese I believe.
But yeah, they're not tie.

588
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:59,830
I think they're more and more of a
check. They like damn, they got me,

589
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,420
they got me in the door of a Chinese
influence now. They had dope man.

590
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:08,530
Thailand was sick. Huh? Loved
it man. Yeah man, I love it.

591
00:32:08,531 --> 00:32:12,130
Cage cage rage was an interesting
place because there was a,

592
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:15,970
that was a wild west of fights. I remember
when Lee Marie fought Anderson Silva.

593
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:18,650
Yup. I do. You know, got into a broad,

594
00:32:18,651 --> 00:32:21,870
the Wayans lead Maria for apparently
like when I started going over there,

595
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,980
they're like, oh, leave my, I was
like, yeah. Everybody said gangs. I,

596
00:32:23,981 --> 00:32:24,814
everybody's a fucking,

597
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,860
this motherfucker was
a real gangs that way

598
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:34,710
to deliver like ticket sales, like money
from ticket sales and like I'm black,

599
00:32:34,711 --> 00:32:38,710
like leather black Duffel bag
just stacked with fucking pounds.

600
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,200
Just like who is this guy? And
the promoters, Dave and Andy,

601
00:32:42,201 --> 00:32:45,680
I think at the time when I was like, no,
my ace allergic gangster and I was like,

602
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:46,010
whoa.

603
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:50,870
Do you remember when he got stabbed in
the heart in a knife fight and then was

604
00:32:50,871 --> 00:32:54,050
training six weeks later?
I do. I do remember that.

605
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:58,340
I don't recall details but I do remember
something to that as London shoe fires.

606
00:32:58,341 --> 00:33:01,970
Our Good Buddy Marius was a
training at 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu.

607
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
He came to La to learn Jujitsu and he
was one of the head guys over at London

608
00:33:07,441 --> 00:33:10,010
chew fighter. So I got to
get in with those guys. Yep.

609
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,090
I'm familiar with the car before all
that shit was going on and he was telling

610
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:18,770
me about Lee Marie like way early,
like back in 2000 you know,

611
00:33:18,771 --> 00:33:21,980
so it was, it was way early,
way back in the early days.

612
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:25,070
It's so funny too because somebody
brought it to my attention and I do it.

613
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:27,380
Did you see Lee Marie is
fucking palace in Morocco.

614
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:32,080
Like he took the money and ran, barely
made it. He made it poster Jorge.

615
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,380
It's a mural.

616
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:39,040
It's like a 30 by 30 48 hour girl
or something like on his wall and,

617
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:43,010
and he's putting the arm
bar on George Rivera. Yeah.

618
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:47,060
And on the back of Georgia shorts is
a big sea Tang dotcom. I'm like, fuck.

619
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:51,650
The only time I didn't want the plug. Well
he was caught him in a triangle. Right.

620
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:55,820
Triangle. Yeah. Triangle
around, you know, that came on.

621
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,810
That was unexpected, you know, but
you know, it was tough man. You know,

622
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:02,150
George was a, a very emotional
fighter. You know, he was,

623
00:34:02,151 --> 00:34:05,330
he had a rough upbringing with his family.
You know, he's very connected to his,

624
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:09,440
to his family and you know, it was, it was
a rollercoaster working with that dude,

625
00:34:09,441 --> 00:34:12,160
man. But he was my first man. You
never forget your first, right. Yeah.

626
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:16,210
He was a great dude, man. I don't
talent, that's for sure man.

627
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:20,390
If you go back and look like he fought
like the WHO's who's of like the UFC like

628
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,190
that, everybody he fought was
legit. He had, he had, he,

629
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,880
there was never a dull moment
of any fights that George had.

630
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:28,760
He had a good run for a while though.
It was the early days.

631
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,860
I remember we were in uh,
when we first started doing shows.

632
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:36,500
It's funny, there's another,
there's another picture too.

633
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,430
It's a weird mural too because it's
guy like go large on that again,

634
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:44,230
another one to portions are off.
So whoever did it was fine.

635
00:34:44,231 --> 00:34:48,260
It horrible out a sign of a shit. Artists,
he might actually done that himself.

636
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,380
Might actually fucking had someone come
in and put some numbers up and fucking

637
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:56,240
paint by numbers.
The old UFC logo,

638
00:34:56,241 --> 00:34:58,530
he's got the Mandalay Bay logo.

639
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,200
It's got him getting him in the triangle.
But if you'd like it,

640
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,630
the one when he's flexing like
that's not even the same dude.

641
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:10,150
Like look at all these extra meat to
his lats and is lower terms. I'm very,

642
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,300
I've seen another one too. He might
have a few in his fucking house of him.

643
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:18,890
Murals of himself looking so
ridiculous. What is the one mute? Why,

644
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:22,730
why one image of the two of them
clinching? Like look at that.

645
00:35:22,731 --> 00:35:24,350
How bizarre.
Like,

646
00:35:24,351 --> 00:35:29,120
why put that picture and it is some
wads a yoked up though. Rock and dude,

647
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,980
good job. Maybe fan of
clean. We put the clean chin.

648
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,770
I want the Mandalay bay or
scale. That's hilarious. You.

649
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,100
I make your arms bigger and then when

650
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:42,140
you get him in the triangle I'll
make you 10 that's like, he's good.

651
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,230
He's not going to say he's not even in
the same tent. He's a different guy.

652
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:49,290
That's hilarious. Yeah. Is
that, is that his place?

653
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,900
So he's still in the pokey
for people who don't know,

654
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:55,320
Lee Marie was a part of the,
one of the biggest armed robberies,

655
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:57,950
I think the biggest in the
history of the UK. Yeah,

656
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,490
huge money they made away with millions
and millions of dollars and some of it's

657
00:36:02,491 --> 00:36:05,070
still millions of pounds I think.
And then do the trend.

658
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:09,560
Did you know the areas we would go out
with a fucking mask on like Hannibal

659
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,150
Lecter. I remember, I remember
that 1 million pounds.

660
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:16,840
It's 53 what's the conversion on
that, Jamie? That's ridiculous. Money.

661
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:21,600
That's crazy. Yeah. It's hard to tell.
Like at the time we would have to go back,

662
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:25,100
figure out what it was, but
a fuss. A lot of money. Yeah.

663
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:28,110
And I think a lot of it is still missing.
But yeah,

664
00:36:28,111 --> 00:36:32,130
they had like Ninja masks on and they
were dressed like they were in that movie

665
00:36:32,131 --> 00:36:35,310
heat. How did they, I thought there
was no extradition like from Morocco.

666
00:36:35,311 --> 00:36:38,020
That's why he fled.
They ended up extraditing him though.

667
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:41,520
Not that who know what happened,
but yeah, I thought that too.

668
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,640
It wasn't that where Badr Hari
went to [inaudible]. I was like,

669
00:36:44,641 --> 00:36:48,270
fuck this and we'll come catch me. Not,

670
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:52,190
they always want to wind up leaving. So
they, they, you know, bought heart. He's,

671
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,760
he did his time.
He went over,

672
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:58,780
he came back and he got Badr Hari got
arrested for stomping a man's Shinon half.

673
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,260
Oh yeah.

674
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:05,850
There was some sort of a dispute in a
nightclub and Badr Hari does not play.

675
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,660
This is a video of him walking into a
hotel and the hotel guy says something

676
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:12,270
stupid to him. So he goes behind a
counter and smacks him in the face.

677
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:17,280
I should that guy. It's my hotel.
He's a fucking giant too. It like six,

678
00:37:17,281 --> 00:37:22,080
five world heavyweight kickboxing
champion and it up for Roche is terrifying

679
00:37:22,081 --> 00:37:26,520
man. Who fucks up grown ass people.
Yeah. Here's the video. Yeah,

680
00:37:26,521 --> 00:37:30,420
I dunno what the guy said, but bought
her heart was like, what? Excuse me?

681
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:35,370
What the fuck did you just say? It
just goes by. Welcome to the Marriott.

682
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:40,420
Uh, we're going to have to see a
credit card. It's like, no, look.

683
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,080
He gets right behind the camera. Fuck.
He smacks him in the back of the head

684
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,890
the way it did it.
It's like super dangerous.

685
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:49,750
Super scary looking to me like
stocks and walks him down downstairs.

686
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,420
He smacked him very dismissively.
It wasn't like worried
about counter. Exactly.

687
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:58,470
Like smack them with a little kid in the
back of the headlight tips is singer.

688
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,740
He was just like, hey, hey, what
the fuck are you talking to Asia?

689
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,670
We've got to pick and choose
your battles wisely, man.

690
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:10,650
I saw about a hiree walking towards me and
like, Oh sir, how can I help you? Yeah.

691
00:38:10,651 --> 00:38:14,520
What may I do for you? Credit card.
That's not, that's ridiculous.

692
00:38:14,521 --> 00:38:18,360
You're sweet is ready. Your champagne
would be brought up to the room.

693
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:23,370
He's Muslim. He probably doesn't
drink. Right. I don't know. Hmm.

694
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,360
He's a beast man. And He's good. He's
supposed to be on his way back. Right. He,

695
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:33,450
he fought Rico Verhoeven and he broke his
arm freak incident in the first round.

696
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,430
It's breaking shinbones

697
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:41,350
breaking arms broke. No, he broke
his arm. Like he fought Ricoh and a,

698
00:38:41,351 --> 00:38:45,520
I think he was blocking a kick
and his arm just broke. And uh,

699
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,070
he realized that somewhere in the
middle of the round he's like,

700
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,970
we've got to stop it. Just like this is
broken. Who just broke down recently at,

701
00:38:51,971 --> 00:38:55,260
during a fight. Was it? Um,
what's it like Paul Felder? Yeah,

702
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,050
during the spinning back.
Cause I saw a common man. Yeah,

703
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,060
that fucking spinning back.
Always read the spin kicks.

704
00:39:01,061 --> 00:39:03,940
Like no matter how many angles
I have in that fucking truck,

705
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:07,770
no matter what I'm looking at as much
experience as is, you know, I have like,

706
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,730
you read the Spin Shit,

707
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,450
like you see it coming a mile away as
it's because you have so much experience.

708
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:15,740
Like with the SPEC kicked shit dude,
that was your shift.

709
00:39:15,741 --> 00:39:18,820
But you see it like a lot of times you're
like, he's setting up. That's been,

710
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,800
he said out the spending.
I'm laid up their hips.

711
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:25,840
I mean that was my number one technique
from when I was fighting was spinning

712
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:26,800
back kick to the body.

713
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:31,330
I just knew that it was
such a short amount of time
that I needed to deliver it.

714
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,130
And if you were in range and I hate you,

715
00:39:33,131 --> 00:39:36,460
you're Foxville cause I knew
there was just like this. We've,

716
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:40,030
we've laughed about this before cause I
tell you like I've never held for a kick

717
00:39:40,031 --> 00:39:41,780
is how to show, isn't
it? I was like, aw dude,

718
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:46,200
don't honey Dyckman you bullshit me bro.
It's not fun holding pads view.

719
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,780
Then there's times like when you
texted me and I'm just like, fuck fuck,

720
00:39:49,781 --> 00:39:53,170
don't return the text. Don't
go, don't go to syndicate.

721
00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:55,450
I don't go to performance and
student hold pads for Joe. Dude.

722
00:39:55,451 --> 00:39:58,050
I remember one time I helped Patsu and uh,

723
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,930
I remember literally like I couldn't
grip a coffee mug to like drink.

724
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,300
My four rounds was so trashy.

725
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:07,390
I remember that night pushing talk back
buttons on the truck at the truck and I

726
00:40:07,391 --> 00:40:10,180
was like fatigued.
Just my fingers wouldn't function bro.

727
00:40:10,181 --> 00:40:13,300
I'm telling you no bullshit.
I've held for a lot of guys.

728
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,250
I've held for a lot of fighters,
a lot of big guys,

729
00:40:15,251 --> 00:40:18,230
small guys I have never held
even that's a round cake.

730
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,660
That's not even some
spin shit that you do.

731
00:40:19,661 --> 00:40:23,590
Like just the basic Thai round kick bro.

732
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,120
Nasty, nasty, nasty. You did it
on that machine too, didn't you?

733
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,790
What were the numbers on it?
Something silly like,

734
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,140
well this is a guy who's figured
out how to beat my number.

735
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:35,680
He a guy at the performance institute.

736
00:40:35,681 --> 00:40:40,681
I got 152,000 and the dude got 188,000
and what he realizes if you hit it with

737
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:47,650
the instead,
see that number's larger a with the Shin.

738
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:48,890
I got to hit it with the instep.

739
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:53,470
I'm healing a slight meniscus tear
that I got when I was doing it with Joe

740
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:56,230
Schilling with no warmup wearing jeans.
I was fucking asshole.

741
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,140
It's fishy years old.
Full blast kick.

742
00:40:59,141 --> 00:41:03,320
No Warren Dick measuring testosterone.
Like what you want to kick, dude,

743
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,180
we're going out.

744
00:41:04,181 --> 00:41:07,090
We're having a good time and Joe shillings
here and he's kicking that thing.

745
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:10,300
Yeah. And he got some pretty
good numbers. You know, he was,

746
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,770
he was smashing it so it was like, he's a
mean dude. I love that dude. I love that.

747
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,360
He's a sweetheart though, man. You
know he's such a cool guy, dude.

748
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:18,520
It's fucking terrifying. Well, I was,

749
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:22,270
I was talking to someone about him and
they were saying that he's like one of

750
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:25,420
the most risk taking elite
fighters you'll ever see.

751
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:30,600
Like he's a real elite kickboxer but
he's been knocked out before and stopped

752
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:34,130
before just because he's so,
he's not risk

753
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,800
averse. Yeah, he'll, he'll take big risks.

754
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,470
But it's one of the reasons why
he's so fucking exciting. Yep,

755
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:41,520
exactly. I was just going to say
the same thing. That's what they,

756
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:44,190
that's what the fans want to see you
man. Yeah. I want to see conservatives,

757
00:41:44,191 --> 00:41:48,700
you know, he's a fan favorite for
sure. You can't stop crazy like that,

758
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,680
that whole song, credible way of
looking at things and his whole motto.

759
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:55,800
That's why I like the, you
know, the bonus, the bonuses
with the UFC and all that.

760
00:41:55,801 --> 00:41:56,970
You know, Dana putting
that together. You know,

761
00:41:56,971 --> 00:41:59,700
I remember back in the day like one of
the early fight or meetings at like,

762
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,690
you know, when we do the way ends and
then Dana would be like all high fighters,

763
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,940
only backstage, you know, they do
fighters only, no coaches, no corners.

764
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:08,850
And Dana was like, yeah, you know, game
plan, no strategy. Fuck all that is.

765
00:42:08,851 --> 00:42:12,220
Go for it. Like you want to get paid. Go.
And one of the examples he would use his,

766
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,450
uh, Chris Lytle Democrats, Slidell lake,

767
00:42:14,451 --> 00:42:16,100
he had like a losing
record and you have to see,

768
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,930
but he was just went for it every time.
And we'd go on this all the time,

769
00:42:18,931 --> 00:42:23,540
you know, so I wouldn't give that speech.
Now we have a very different speed.

770
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,840
Y'All speech can says the
fight your best fight,

771
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,920
fight the way you're supposed to find.
That was the message.

772
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:33,580
But the idea was don't, don't know. Leave
it out there. Don't be conservative out

773
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:36,290
there if you want, your
opponent might not, you know,

774
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:39,150
this is the thing I don't think I don't,

775
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:43,620
fighting is very important to me.
It means a lot.

776
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:48,840
It means a lot because I used to do it.
It means a lot cause I love to watch it.

777
00:42:48,841 --> 00:42:52,830
It means a lot because I'm very deeply
entrenched in the history and the

778
00:42:52,831 --> 00:42:55,410
significance of it, what
it means. And for me,

779
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:59,070
fighting should always
be done at its best.

780
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:02,880
And what that means is you should always
do what's the right thing to do in this

781
00:43:02,881 --> 00:43:05,970
situation. Like if you are, uh, you know,

782
00:43:05,971 --> 00:43:09,390
you could break it down when
individual arts, right? If your, um,

783
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,490
if you're doing Jujitsu,
there's a,

784
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,700
there's a correct way to do
an arm bar counter, right?

785
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,900
Don't do the incorrect way because
the fans want to see, right.

786
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,560
That doesn't make any sense to me.

787
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:22,620
If there's an exciting way
to get out of an arm bar,

788
00:43:22,621 --> 00:43:24,690
that's not the right way
to do it with the fans,

789
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:28,440
but it might well pick them up and slam.
I'm works if you have to,

790
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:32,190
but I'm saying like just as
a rough example, if, if you,

791
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,760
if there was a way to defend an arm bar
that wasn't the correct way to do it,

792
00:43:35,761 --> 00:43:39,330
but the fans liked it more.
Don't do that. Don't do that.

793
00:43:39,331 --> 00:43:43,920
You want to fight like a maestro, right?
You want to fight like, like a virtuoso.

794
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,160
You want to fight like mighty mouse. There
you go. Exactly. What I tell everybody,

795
00:43:47,161 --> 00:43:50,670
you look at my mighty mouse has had
moments in his career like the Ian Mccall

796
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:54,690
fight is a good example where he was,
he also had a fulltime job,

797
00:43:55,620 --> 00:44:00,450
wasn't dedicated the way it should be and
got into a brawl and Ian took us back.

798
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:04,200
Why not pounding them and mighty
mouse had vertigo after that fight.

799
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:07,950
He was really fucked up and
then quit his job. Realize like,

800
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:12,300
I have to go full time. I have to dedicate
myself to this full time, you know?

801
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,790
And when he did that,
then under the tutelage of Matt Hume,

802
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:18,960
he became the mighty mouse we see now.
But in my opinion,

803
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:23,010
one of the things that sets him
apart from everybody else is that he,

804
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,880
he's not running away from
you and not getting hit.

805
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,030
He's running at you and
not getting hit or, I mean,

806
00:44:30,031 --> 00:44:32,130
he's coming straight forward and

807
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:36,870
then cutting angles and doing things to
you that you didn't anticipate and he's

808
00:44:36,871 --> 00:44:41,580
not there for the counters. So he's
fighting correctly. Seamless too.

809
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,850
Yeah. And it's incredibly exciting.
And that was one of the, the,

810
00:44:44,851 --> 00:44:49,710
the criticisms of him really early on in
his reign was that he wasn't finishing

811
00:44:49,711 --> 00:44:52,020
guys and then he knocked
out Joseph Benevidez.

812
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:55,820
Then he started finishing
guys in the final seconds of
the round. Right. You know,

813
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:59,820
I mean, he's, he's just a monster
man is man. He says fucking monster.

814
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:04,440
But he fights correctly,
I would say don't fund all,

815
00:45:04,441 --> 00:45:07,860
no disrespect to Chris Lytle,
who I love. He's a great fighter.

816
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:11,610
I was just watching as well. His fight
against Brian Foster, you so skilled,

817
00:45:11,611 --> 00:45:15,090
like people who've got all good. Chris
Lytle was won that fight with a leg lock,

818
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:20,610
you know, and he's known as a brawler and
people forget, he fucking spun around,

819
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:24,630
got that leg and snatch it out and
extend it and really fuck Brian's leg up

820
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,320
crafty veteran. Here's a
crafty guy, but broad a lot.

821
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:32,910
I'm not a fan of PR. I'm a fan of
watching brawls when they take place.

822
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,140
I'm not a fan as well either.
You know what I mean? I'm
more of a fan of a, of an,

823
00:45:37,141 --> 00:45:40,320
I train a lot of my guys like
almost offensively like backing up,

824
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:43,620
like retreat fighting, you know,
constantly trying to jockey for position.

825
00:45:43,621 --> 00:45:46,710
I call it like right place, right time
all the time. And that line of fire,

826
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:49,590
you know, we're with jockey and
for that position, you know,

827
00:45:49,591 --> 00:45:53,070
and it's a lot of times it's
easier just to take a step back.

828
00:45:53,071 --> 00:45:54,990
If we're fighting each other with
standing in front of each other,

829
00:45:54,991 --> 00:45:57,270
I take a step back, what do you
naturally do? You Walk to me.

830
00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:01,590
So it's the timing of catching them on
the way in. And guys like, you know,

831
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:05,570
great fighters in my opinion.
A more like defensive fighters like you,

832
00:46:05,571 --> 00:46:08,130
like you said earlier about Chris
Leben coming into Anderson Silva,

833
00:46:08,131 --> 00:46:09,340
Forrest Griffin.
Sure.

834
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:13,050
Trying to attack like
you're more vulnerable like
recklessly like you said like

835
00:46:13,051 --> 00:46:16,490
brawling recklessly coming in against
somebody skilled as Anderson silver with

836
00:46:16,491 --> 00:46:19,290
Demetrius Johnson, you know, so I'm
all, I'm a fan of the retreating attack.

837
00:46:19,291 --> 00:46:21,830
I call it Anderson was
such a retreating attacker.

838
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,970
Then he had a problem when guys
didn't come forward. Right. Exactly.

839
00:46:24,971 --> 00:46:28,580
The stinkers that Talus Talus later.

840
00:46:28,581 --> 00:46:32,700
So painful to watch those [inaudible]
Patrick Kotecha coattail was very smart

841
00:46:32,701 --> 00:46:36,600
when he fought him damaging.
I camped him that whole fight.

842
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:41,510
I will fight. I had the experience from
Jorge, I knew Anderson Silva, you know,

843
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,800
he spent that entire camp in Boston with
me. Um, he did have a knee injury, uh,

844
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:48,840
going into the fight we knew like it
was going to be an issue but you know I

845
00:46:48,841 --> 00:46:51,960
said that I actually said this to him
part of the game plan and strategy.

846
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,210
It's funny you say that was to let
him come to you like everybody when,

847
00:46:55,211 --> 00:46:57,360
cause Patrick was the type of
fighter that was a go getter.

848
00:46:57,361 --> 00:46:59,970
He had that big overhand right.
You know, he would, he would,

849
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,060
he would put pressure on you and
I said, Patrick, I'm telling you,

850
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:06,850
you can't fight the way you normally
fight against Anderson Silva. Even if,

851
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:10,920
if you hear boos with following the
game plan, you know, if you hit,

852
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:13,620
if you hear the boos from the crowd,
like with doing, doing the right thing,

853
00:47:13,621 --> 00:47:17,220
don't fall victim to it.
Don't try to lunge at them.
Don't pro big power punches.

854
00:47:17,221 --> 00:47:19,020
Let him come to you.
And we did.

855
00:47:19,021 --> 00:47:22,170
And that was actually the first
time we took a Anderson past.

856
00:47:22,171 --> 00:47:24,450
The third round I think
was either third of the,

857
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:25,800
we actually going into the fourth,

858
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:30,070
I think that ended up stepping in to
throw a kick in his leg blew out. Exactly.

859
00:47:30,071 --> 00:47:32,400
Yup. Yup. I told her that
was in Chicago. I called it,

860
00:47:32,401 --> 00:47:36,010
did we get an MRI before that fight?
I think, uh, if I remember correctly,

861
00:47:36,011 --> 00:47:39,130
he had an issue. We knew going into it.
We didn't want to pull out of the fight,

862
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:43,060
you know, down shoe. Uh, it was,
it was pretty severe and after it,

863
00:47:43,061 --> 00:47:44,680
I would think that was
just the icing of the cake.

864
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:48,030
It blew out completely during the flight.
So he had a partial tear of his ac,

865
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:51,060
something like that. Something to that
effect. Bring up that flight. Jamie.

866
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:55,780
I'm curious now. It was weird. It was a
weird blow out because it's almost like,

867
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:58,870
I was just going to say there was like,
it wasn't during an exchange. I think,

868
00:47:58,871 --> 00:48:00,880
like you said,
he went to push off his back foot.

869
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:03,100
I don't want to be curious to see if
it's been a while since I visited that.

870
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:06,220
Yeah. I just remember not knowing
what happened and he fell down.

871
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:09,720
And you called death light on C, right?
Yeah. That was before. What's that,

872
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:13,490
Patrick?
Coty and so yeah,

873
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:19,060
from probably 2000 what was that?
Nine maybe a little later?

874
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:22,730
Yeah, maybe nine or 10 yeah, 200
suppliers at this point. I know.

875
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:26,770
Some flair to it and then like 400 Joe.
Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, I see.

876
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,410
That was a while ago. Yeah. Wow Man.

877
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,300
That was the rain that was going to
Anderson. He had, he was, he was the king,

878
00:48:34,301 --> 00:48:37,630
but people didn't appreciate him
the way they appreciated them.

879
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:41,780
After he knocked out Forrest Griffin
and Stephan Bonner after [inaudible] for

880
00:48:41,781 --> 00:48:46,240
that front kick to the face. Yeah. That's
when he became the goat dude. He was,

881
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:49,640
he was like,
like literally feared like I think a lot,

882
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:51,520
a lot of fighters just like,
ah,

883
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,980
that call came and it was
like Anderson Silva like fuck.

884
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:55,960
Well he was also so calm.
Yeah.

885
00:48:55,961 --> 00:48:58,060
You know there was something
about him in those days.

886
00:48:58,061 --> 00:49:01,360
He was so used to always say this and I
told Jorge this at his cage rage fight

887
00:49:01,361 --> 00:49:04,210
with them. I said, do it. He beats
people at the weigh ins. He's like,

888
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:06,250
what do you mean here?
Like what do you mean he has this thing?

889
00:49:06,251 --> 00:49:09,250
It's funny like when he goes to weigh
in with you like you don't normally like

890
00:49:09,251 --> 00:49:11,320
people go like face to face.
They get real close.

891
00:49:11,321 --> 00:49:13,900
Like he would walk up to
as if you're going to,

892
00:49:13,901 --> 00:49:15,730
and then he would thrust his neck forward,

893
00:49:15,731 --> 00:49:19,000
like his head would like fucking gadget
head like would come out and he would

894
00:49:19,001 --> 00:49:21,940
just be all up in your face and they
would like surprise you. Like, you know,

895
00:49:21,941 --> 00:49:23,380
and I told Jorge that. I said, Jorge,

896
00:49:23,381 --> 00:49:26,260
be ready at the way in like he's gonna
put his face like he's going to come a

897
00:49:26,261 --> 00:49:29,440
distance quickly. Like he moves his head
like fucking shit. Ne Ne like, he's like,

898
00:49:29,441 --> 00:49:30,274
I don't know your dad.

899
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:35,140
He puts his head like way out and he did
it and I was like, Oh man, there it is.

900
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:40,090
Well that was one of the ways that Chris
Liebing overcame him psychologically at

901
00:49:40,091 --> 00:49:43,720
the Wayans crew. I remember Chris saying,
I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid of you.

902
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:46,270
Yeah. He was looking right at him
and he said, I'm not afraid of you.

903
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:49,480
And he probably wasn't, man wasn't
afraid of him. He wasn't afraid of him.

904
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:52,630
That was Chris when he was in his prime
and that's when they were kissing at the

905
00:49:52,631 --> 00:49:55,080
way in when Anderson got so close.
That's right.

906
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:59,530
They were literally lip to lip and
Christy just judge somebody just spoke of

907
00:49:59,531 --> 00:50:02,350
something about him fighting in that
bare knuckle league or something against

908
00:50:02,351 --> 00:50:07,180
Phil Baroni or something like that. Chris
Leben verse Philbrick Cook. Which leap?

909
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:12,520
Yeah, but I said Chris Weidman.
Oh, Weidman. Weidman's I
did say Weidman, right?

910
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:17,230
No leave. And I thought I said
Wiedemann I've combined the two man.

911
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:20,440
Did I say wiping or
leaving? Leaving. Okay.

912
00:50:20,441 --> 00:50:24,400
I might have fucked up Chris Weidman
when Weidman beat. Oh, he, yeah,

913
00:50:24,401 --> 00:50:27,830
he beat him at the way they got face
to face. Yeah. And he said, yeah,

914
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,940
I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid of you.
And when he was looking at right now,

915
00:50:30,941 --> 00:50:34,040
because I'm not afraid of you bro. And
then you could tell Anna, she was like,

916
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:38,210
Oh shit, he's not afraid of that and see
what happened that night he had event.

917
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:43,250
What's interesting in that fight too
was that Anderson could, I mean he was,

918
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:48,580
he was clearly scoring with heavy leg
kicks and putting Lieben in jeopardy.

919
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:52,640
I mean, he was damaging that leg. Say
Liebman I said it again. I said it again.

920
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:56,180
What's wrong with me? Why am I confusing
those two? They both Chris, fuck it.

921
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:01,630
I should just say Chris. I just
say Chris, Chris, Chris, when uh,

922
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:05,440
Weidman Weidman's got 'em down the first
round, almost got him in a leg lock. Yup.

923
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,690
And then they got back up to feet in an
industry and started fucking him up with

924
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:12,850
leg kicks and Anderson was hitting him
with some nasty, nasty leg kicks up.

925
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:17,930
And he was uh, he was saying in between
rounds like, come on, stand up with me.

926
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:22,280
Yeah, come on. Stand up with
me. It was weird. It was
weird that he was doing that.

927
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:25,610
Like he was, it was totally out
of character. He said, no, no,

928
00:51:25,611 --> 00:51:27,170
we're not going to go do
it. Come on, stand up.

929
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:31,010
And I know he got some funky moments in
the [inaudible] down the fucking on Bach

930
00:51:31,011 --> 00:51:34,820
and moving his hands off on tour
before he freaked dancing and shit.

931
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,650
Like I remember there was
a couple of fights. Well,

932
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:41,710
the fight with the Damien Maia was just
referring to psychologically fell apart

933
00:51:42,111 --> 00:51:46,100
in that fight. He was screaming at
Damien Maia yelling things at him.

934
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:48,350
And Damien Maia is,
is still plugging away.

935
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:51,530
He took a lot of shots and that
fight but then was their third,

936
00:51:51,531 --> 00:51:55,310
fourth and fifth when Anderson wasn't
doing shit and it was just like moving

937
00:51:55,311 --> 00:51:56,700
away from that. The fight, there was a,

938
00:51:56,701 --> 00:51:59,600
there was one flight to where he was
like in the center of the Octagon Control

939
00:51:59,601 --> 00:52:02,500
on beat and I'm striking and
like, I forget who it was.
It might've been the day,

940
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:03,950
it might've been somebody else,
but he uh,

941
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:08,150
he actually stopped and step back and put
us back to the fence and say, come on,

942
00:52:08,151 --> 00:52:10,250
come on, let's fight on the fence
now. And he like backed his self.

943
00:52:10,251 --> 00:52:11,600
Oh Stephan Bonner's.
That's right.

944
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,120
And that's what he got caught with
a spin and elbow. Was it a no,

945
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,520
Stephan Bonner tried to spinning back,

946
00:52:16,521 --> 00:52:19,790
kick him and he just slid out of the way
and they went right back to the fence

947
00:52:19,791 --> 00:52:22,730
and went, come on. That's what
it was. Exactly. Fucked him up.

948
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:26,500
I think he hit him with a knee to the
body and then dropped him and then,

949
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:29,150
and then beat the shit out
of him. Yeah. That was just,

950
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:34,370
he was just so calm and relaxed in there
and bond or was so stiff and tight and

951
00:52:34,371 --> 00:52:37,160
I think that was on her
style too. Was it? Yeah.

952
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:39,200
I've worked with Stephen
for a bunch of fights.

953
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:40,720
I didn't work on them for that fight.
I don't recall it,

954
00:52:40,721 --> 00:52:44,660
but that was also a fight where um,
I think or pissed hot.

955
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:47,810
I think he had an opportunity. Yeah,
I think he's just like, listen,

956
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:50,330
I got some injuries but I'm
just going to juice it up. Dude.

957
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:54,920
Pissed hot is better than shit hot cause
when he fought Sam Hogart at the Thomas

958
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:59,210
Macarena, you fucking shit himself during
the fight. Oh Sam a Hogan. I was like,

959
00:52:59,211 --> 00:53:02,110
Bro, it's like on top of that graph and
he's like probably fucking stinky shit.

960
00:53:02,111 --> 00:53:04,370
He's up. And he's like,
yes I did. Stuff like that.

961
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:07,580
And the worst part about it is we
come backstage, you know the tie cups,

962
00:53:07,581 --> 00:53:11,150
they liked the string up, the crap, the
butt crack. He's like, coach, get my cup.

963
00:53:11,151 --> 00:53:15,130
And I was like, Bro, you're
on your own home. He ended
up with scissors. I was like,

964
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:18,320
cut it off dude. I'm good.
It's Hilarious, dude.

965
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,870
I got the corner I think for that
fight with the great coliseum.

966
00:53:20,871 --> 00:53:23,600
Crazy at the time when it
has happened several times.

967
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:28,740
What was one of the fights at themselves
via shit himself once when we rent to

968
00:53:28,741 --> 00:53:32,490
the, uh, went to the Reebok uniforms and
dude's wearing white. I was like, Bro,

969
00:53:32,491 --> 00:53:34,920
that idea.
No white shorts.

970
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:38,610
Like stay away from white shorts
Brown. I think you'll, well dude,

971
00:53:38,611 --> 00:53:42,300
you will vert mayor de Dynisha. Yeah, I
think he sharded one of his fights too.

972
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,940
One time. Michael Kia. So when
he fought by Neil Darr, you, she,

973
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:47,730
right before the fight start, he
leans over to me. He goes, dude,

974
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:50,690
I might shut myself over
that before the walk. Dude,

975
00:53:50,691 --> 00:53:52,950
they almost had to postpone the walk man.

976
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,150
He was going to run to remember
UFC staff started. Yeah, UFC staff.

977
00:53:57,151 --> 00:53:58,860
He was in the tunnel getting
ready to walk. He's like, Bro,

978
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:00,720
I got to go the bathroom. They're like,
no, no, you're good. You're gonna be like,

979
00:54:00,721 --> 00:54:05,250
why didn't you just let them go? How long
did it take? I don't know. 30 seconds.

980
00:54:05,251 --> 00:54:09,090
We'll cover what the guy took a dump.
Right. And then right behind him,

981
00:54:09,091 --> 00:54:12,000
production time, the format,
fucking schedule, whatever it is,

982
00:54:12,001 --> 00:54:15,240
but do when a man's got to shit, he's got
a shit. Here's the Anderson and Patrick.

983
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:19,260
Yeah. So is this on fight
pass? This is the first round.

984
00:54:19,261 --> 00:54:23,550
So it didn't happen till third or fourth
of whatever it was. I think it was a,

985
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,620
I think it was the third round,

986
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:28,830
but see Jesse Anderson was just
moving around real relaxed.

987
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,890
Didn't do much.
Oh yeah.

988
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:36,420
It was an interesting fight because
Kobe didn't fight his normal style.

989
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:40,380
He stayed real like boxed
up. Oh, I forgot this.

990
00:54:40,381 --> 00:54:44,460
That Anderson had him down at
one point in time and listens.

991
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,340
Grappling is underrated to have and he's
a good grappler. He's just long as fuck.

992
00:54:47,341 --> 00:54:50,160
He's built to grapple to like this.
Even when he was kicking it. Look,

993
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:53,250
he takes him out. He's like, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no. I think this is,

994
00:54:53,251 --> 00:54:56,940
his knee was already, I think
we knew at this point. He's
like, my knees, Jack. Dot.

995
00:54:56,941 --> 00:54:57,810
Dude.
My knees checked up.

996
00:54:57,811 --> 00:55:02,160
I remember him talking to me during the
fight and in between rounds. But uh,

997
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:05,160
he definitely, uh, he definitely
been put up a fight at least.

998
00:55:05,161 --> 00:55:07,890
And at the time nobody was even
close to putting up a fight.

999
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:12,930
Well it's right before then.
Patrick was super fucking dangerous.

1000
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:13,320
Ah,

1001
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,900
see this is where we set out with the
first one to take them to the third round

1002
00:55:15,901 --> 00:55:18,480
cause nobody had passed the second
round with him. Well, not only that,

1003
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,430
it was a totally uneventful three rounds.

1004
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:24,160
There wasn't even a moment where
Patrick was in trouble, you know,

1005
00:55:24,161 --> 00:55:28,220
and he was fighting for the title. It
was main event, title fight. You know,

1006
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,180
Patrick was always dangerous.

1007
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:33,990
He always had that one bomb
that could put you out.

1008
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:38,700
And Anderson knew that, you know, so he,
he was, he was fighting a smart strategy.

1009
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:41,790
But it was interesting because it
kind of showed a hole in his style.

1010
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:46,860
His style was so counter attacking.
He did not write that. Oh,

1011
00:55:46,861 --> 00:55:49,140
that's what he did.
He tried to lift his front foot up,

1012
00:55:49,141 --> 00:55:53,130
almost like to fake like a front kick.
Bring that back to me that he tried,

1013
00:55:53,131 --> 00:55:56,100
he tried to pick up his front leg
to fake like a tea but a fake,

1014
00:55:56,101 --> 00:56:00,720
like a front leg attack and then he hopped
on his back leg. Yeah. It's rough man.

1015
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:06,180
Weird. Yeah. See right
there. There it is. Yeah.

1016
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:08,510
Cause he's in a lot of pain to coattails.
A tough duty to Amanda.

1017
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:11,580
See Him wins and go down
like that is the issue.

1018
00:56:11,581 --> 00:56:13,590
Was it a meniscus issue or was it all,

1019
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:16,530
I'd be lying if I made some shit up
right now, but I think it was some,

1020
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:18,990
something like that and
assist a ball joint.

1021
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:23,260
That's why you always had in mind for
call dude. I think he had issues too.

1022
00:56:23,261 --> 00:56:24,130
Like he had a staph

1023
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,050
infection in his knee,
like repeatedly.

1024
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:28,540
Like I remember he had staff in
his knee like a bunch of times,

1025
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:32,260
so I don't know man.
But he uh, you know his,

1026
00:56:32,261 --> 00:56:35,980
his best punch to was not on his overhand
right, but it's rear uppercut. Nasty.

1027
00:56:35,981 --> 00:56:40,660
Nasty. Yeah. He asked me the
fuck up a bunch of times.
It's, it was weird. His power.

1028
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:45,730
It's not like he didn't look like a
strong guy, but his power was weird. Yeah.

1029
00:56:45,731 --> 00:56:49,330
See you watch, he hops up on
that front leg and do you see it?

1030
00:56:49,331 --> 00:56:53,210
Just keep that tonk.
Yeah.

1031
00:56:55,240 --> 00:57:00,050
Dude. Knees back, nasty
injuries. All those leg lock.

1032
00:57:00,051 --> 00:57:01,990
Motherfuckers all fucked up knees.

1033
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:06,400
Eddie just had to get his meniscus
fixed to up meniscus operation pretty

1034
00:57:06,401 --> 00:57:10,840
recently. Yeah. He had
shoulder surgery recently.

1035
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:15,190
He had back surgery recently. Yeah, he
back surgery a little over a year ago.

1036
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,600
Knee surgery recently.

1037
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:19,990
He's not doing that stem cell shit
you're talking about now. No, he hasn't.

1038
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:23,710
I think he did something, but he didn't
do it with the place that I go to,

1039
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:27,280
but it's just, you know,
years and years of Jujitsu.

1040
00:57:27,281 --> 00:57:29,020
It's just not good for your body.

1041
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:33,400
Everybody that I know is righteous
Jujitsu, bro. I'm telling you, I,

1042
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,210
I s I sustained most of my
injuries and Roland like, yeah.

1043
00:57:37,211 --> 00:57:40,750
It's like almost like I can't get out of
a Jujitsu session like g o Nogi without

1044
00:57:40,751 --> 00:57:42,250
getting something tweaked to something.

1045
00:57:42,251 --> 00:57:46,710
You know what I was talking the other
night with some guys from team Alpha male

1046
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,870
number. We're talking about
guys who have fake discs.

1047
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:54,460
How many guys have had artificial discs
put in their necks and then their backs.

1048
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:56,530
It's a fucking terrifying number.

1049
00:57:56,531 --> 00:57:59,980
You keep going on and not used
to like he got one too. Yeah,

1050
00:57:59,981 --> 00:58:04,090
he's got two in his neck like watts.
He's got one in his lower back. What?

1051
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:09,730
God dammit, he's 30 and this guys like 30
years old. The fake bags. Combat Sports.

1052
00:58:09,731 --> 00:58:14,560
A rough man. Yeah, body, particularly
wrestling and particularly Jujitsu.

1053
00:58:14,561 --> 00:58:17,650
Wrestling. It seems to be a lot
of the neck and the Jujitsu.

1054
00:58:17,651 --> 00:58:21,430
It's neck and lower back.
The lower back seems to get jacked done.

1055
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:24,340
Almost everybody. I've been lucky,
knock on wood, I've been lucky.

1056
00:58:24,341 --> 00:58:27,190
I haven't really suffered any serious
injuries in my training career.

1057
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:29,180
I wonder too how much,
uh,

1058
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:34,230
Thai training and throwing kicks because
it's so core intensive kicking it so

1059
00:58:35,351 --> 00:58:40,210
much, so much. I think it protects
you because like a lot of my leg,

1060
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:45,310
my lower back, it's very heavily
muscled. The lower back in the mid.

1061
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:48,910
It's one of the first things
like I actually look at
when I'm like studying like

1062
00:58:48,911 --> 00:58:51,490
a fighter as I look to see
his back pack and I was like,

1063
00:58:51,491 --> 00:58:54,100
this guy is going to be strong.
What makes you say that? Like Dude,

1064
00:58:54,101 --> 00:58:56,420
look at his lower eye.
Lower back specifics.

1065
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:58,900
I say that I'm like
look at his lower back.

1066
00:58:58,901 --> 00:59:03,040
You see guys with like jacked
up like lower back muscles.

1067
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:04,990
Do you know their core
strength is just off the chain?

1068
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:08,850
Do you have a reverse hyper in your
gym? Do you have one of those? No Dude,

1069
00:59:08,851 --> 00:59:12,240
that should be standard in any
gym where they wrestle really?

1070
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:17,250
And that's the one where you while lie
down on the table with your upper body

1071
00:59:17,951 --> 00:59:22,951
and your lower body hangs down and hooks
into this thing and it was created by

1072
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:25,340
Louie Simmons,
that guy from west side Barbell,

1073
00:59:25,341 --> 00:59:28,700
the power lifting monster and
when you lift your legs up,

1074
00:59:28,701 --> 00:59:32,660
it's strengthens your back.
There it is right there on the way down.

1075
00:59:32,661 --> 00:59:37,510
It decompresses the spine lengthens.
Almost like decompresses. See,

1076
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,230
here's a video.
If you show him the video,

1077
00:59:39,231 --> 00:59:43,490
he'll get a chance to see what it is
and the video Louise explaining it.

1078
00:59:43,491 --> 00:59:44,840
But we have one back here and I've,

1079
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:49,250
I've had one for a couple of years
now and it's, it's just go forward.

1080
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:52,690
Just go forward and you don't need to
see the vault here, the volume. Um,

1081
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:57,590
see as she's going up it's strengthening
her back and then on the down it

1082
00:59:57,591 --> 01:00:01,820
extends and it lengthens the
back and decompresses it.

1083
01:00:01,821 --> 01:00:03,260
It's active decompression.

1084
01:00:03,261 --> 01:00:08,261
It's one of the rare things that provides
active decompression in contrast with

1085
01:00:08,481 --> 01:00:09,314
strengthening.

1086
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:13,940
So it strengthens it on the way up and
then loosens it on the way back and that

1087
01:00:13,941 --> 01:00:18,170
activating the muscles and
the strengthening portion
portion of it and then the

1088
01:00:18,171 --> 01:00:19,910
decompression portion together.

1089
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:25,240
It's uniquely good for
a uniquely effective for
strengthening and rehabilitating

1090
01:00:26,931 --> 01:00:29,480
lower back issues. Interesting. Yeah.

1091
01:00:29,481 --> 01:00:32,810
He developed it because they
were trying to give him surgery.

1092
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:33,853
They were trying to,

1093
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:38,120
they were trying to fuse this
together cause he had a bulging disk.

1094
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:40,640
So he's trying to figure out
how to fix a bulging disc.

1095
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,290
And that's how I figured it out.

1096
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:46,220
But it's now like universally praised
has been one of the as being one of the

1097
01:00:46,221 --> 01:00:49,670
best exercises to prevent injury.

1098
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:52,940
But more importantly to rehabilitate you
if you have something like that going

1099
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:55,940
on. I gotta check that out for sure.
It should be standard for every gym.

1100
01:00:56,330 --> 01:01:00,530
It's one of those pieces of equipment
that I think like one of the big things

1101
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:05,300
that happens with guys is compression
and very few fighters in particular spend

1102
01:01:05,301 --> 01:01:10,100
time doing spinal decompression,
like on those inversion table version.

1103
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:13,970
Those are great and they're great.
Just just chill on one of those,

1104
01:01:13,971 --> 01:01:16,970
those teeters chill on one of
those for 10 minutes a day.

1105
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:20,440
Just put the boots on and
kick back and just and,

1106
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:22,910
and then tighten your backup
and then let it loose.

1107
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:27,050
Tighten your backup and let him choose
and he could push on the handles,

1108
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:31,700
give yourself some separation. You're
just, you have to do something to,

1109
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:34,610
to compensate for all the pressure,
right?

1110
01:01:34,611 --> 01:01:38,390
So there's all this compression and
you've got to do something to decompress.

1111
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:41,340
Seen something to like with a,
like a band around your neck.

1112
01:01:41,341 --> 01:01:43,670
You lay in the floor and I'm just like
put it on a door knob almost like,

1113
01:01:43,671 --> 01:01:46,670
and it pulls your head up. You ever seen
something like that? I have one that's a,

1114
01:01:46,671 --> 01:01:51,210
it's a thing that you put on your
Chin and I put it on a, a unit, like a

1115
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:53,510
barbell.

1116
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:57,290
So I hook it up to the barbell and then
I sit underneath it with a chair saying

1117
01:01:57,291 --> 01:01:59,160
that I'm extending my
neck. It's a click, click,

1118
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:03,520
click like two inches tall. Itching. Yeah,

1119
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:06,590
like you said to wrestling as
the worst man. Just like that.

1120
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:10,370
Always shooting that single
sheet. Wrapping and calming
the back of your head.

1121
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:14,720
Yeah, it's rough. Well
ty too, right? Oh my God.

1122
01:02:14,721 --> 01:02:15,531
I remember the first,

1123
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:18,970
one of the first experiences I had clinch
and with guys in Thailand, you know,

1124
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:20,070
I was one of the bigger guys,

1125
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,640
they were like, oh, I need, you
need you to clench. You know?

1126
01:02:21,641 --> 01:02:25,970
And he's tied to just hanging on my neck,
hanging on my neck, you know, you know,

1127
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:29,480
for an hour straight.
And I've never felt anything like that.

1128
01:02:29,481 --> 01:02:31,800
And then my neck was completely locked up.
I couldn't turn.

1129
01:02:31,801 --> 01:02:35,550
I had to actually get one of those. Uh,
the neck braces there, the callers? Yeah.

1130
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:38,100
I had to get like mid massage,
like every day I literally,

1131
01:02:38,101 --> 01:02:40,920
I was out of train and probably for
four or five days I couldn't even train.

1132
01:02:40,921 --> 01:02:42,780
I couldn't answer that.
It's almost like having a stiff neck,

1133
01:02:42,781 --> 01:02:44,190
but it was horrible man.

1134
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:49,080
Those muscles don't get used that much
or you're not doing the correct. Yeah,

1135
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:51,930
if you're not doing like neck extensions.

1136
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:55,110
And then I went to my trainer and I was
like, how do I make my next stronger?

1137
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:59,970
And he took me over to this coffee can
filled with cement and a rope coming out

1138
01:02:59,971 --> 01:03:01,170
of it and he said,

1139
01:03:01,171 --> 01:03:05,270
you bite the rope and you go in a member
of ringside had like a thing like that.

1140
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:05,760
They,

1141
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,910
they put that like thing like a strap
around your head and you put the chains

1142
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:10,930
real weight. I did the, yeah,

1143
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:15,030
but biting it seems better to get
your work in the mandible as well.

1144
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,600
The problem was, is everybody
fucking bid on the thing and they,

1145
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:20,160
and the fucking good,

1146
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:24,730
all the bad mouthpiece.
But

1147
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,830
I remember being in a bank in,
in Thailand,

1148
01:03:28,831 --> 01:03:32,370
in patio once and like there was like
a water like thing, but there was,

1149
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:34,230
there was no plastic cups.
They was,

1150
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,600
there was no like a cop's
like disposable cups.

1151
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,660
There was a plastic cup with
a string tied to it. Oh,

1152
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:44,400
we'll just go and fill it and just lip
on it and put it down. I'm like, Bro,

1153
01:03:44,401 --> 01:03:49,260
this is rough dude. Right. Well I got to
figure, it's like I'm not that thirsty.

1154
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:54,150
Those moist environments, like there's
so much bacteria in the air anyway.

1155
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:57,660
Like how common is, um,
how common is staff? Dude,

1156
01:03:57,661 --> 01:04:00,600
it's so funny you say that because you
would think it would run rampant like

1157
01:04:00,601 --> 01:04:01,650
ringworm.
Like I remember,

1158
01:04:01,651 --> 01:04:04,710
I remember one of the first times I got
ringworm in Thailand and I like had a

1159
01:04:04,711 --> 01:04:07,860
bandaid on it and I was clenching when
one of my train upon his tie guy and the

1160
01:04:07,861 --> 01:04:10,080
band aid came off and I was like, hold
on, let me go it. And he's like, well Nah,

1161
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:12,690
don't worry about it. And I was like,
no, like, let me like, cover this up.

1162
01:04:12,691 --> 01:04:15,470
And He'd like, he touched it and
he was rubbing it like, I'll do it.

1163
01:04:15,471 --> 01:04:17,550
Don't worry about that threat. And I was
like, dude, no, no, no, no, no. It's like,

1164
01:04:17,551 --> 01:04:18,211
it's ringworm bro.

1165
01:04:18,211 --> 01:04:21,630
And like it's like the like Thai
led the skin is like immune to it.

1166
01:04:21,631 --> 01:04:24,660
They don't fucking get ringworm. They
don't get staff. Like it's weird.

1167
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:28,050
Like you don't don't get it. Not Common.
No, it's weird. I'm sure they do get it.

1168
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:31,430
But it's funny like it doesn't
like run rampant in the gyms.

1169
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,980
Like you would think like
a bunch of sweaty tie dudes
training with no shirts on

1170
01:04:34,981 --> 01:04:37,860
clinch in hanging all over each other.
You know, and they, they, you know,

1171
01:04:37,861 --> 01:04:40,650
they laying on the ground doing sit
ups and pushups and all that bullshit.

1172
01:04:40,651 --> 01:04:42,120
And is,
it's not common.

1173
01:04:42,121 --> 01:04:44,440
Like there's not a lot of
ringworm in the gyms is not a lot.

1174
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,110
A lot of staph infections.

1175
01:04:46,111 --> 01:04:49,500
I don't know if just the their body
builds immunity to, I don't know.

1176
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:53,910
It's just not common. It's not common
American gyms, it's all am I, God,

1177
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:57,960
I remember being on the ultimate fighter
season when I coached us season for the

1178
01:04:57,961 --> 01:05:01,260
comeback. Would Jorge Patrick Hotel
all the time, met all those guys, uh,

1179
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:04,530
Chris Lytle, et Cetera, et cetera.
Matt Serra was on that show. Uh,

1180
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:09,300
who was it that got it? Edwin dewees I
think got a staph infection and nobody,

1181
01:05:09,301 --> 01:05:11,100
everybody's like, oh, what the hell's
wrong with just getting, I was like, Bro,

1182
01:05:11,101 --> 01:05:14,400
that's like, that's like the Heebie
jeebies that's like the matte scabies,

1183
01:05:14,401 --> 01:05:17,890
like that staff. And everybody was like,
what? Like wait you stat? And I was like,

1184
01:05:17,891 --> 01:05:21,010
Bro, that staph infection like one
was a lot. And I went to the UFC,

1185
01:05:21,070 --> 01:05:22,090
the production team and I said,

1186
01:05:22,091 --> 01:05:25,570
when was the last time you guys
wipe clean the mats? Like, oh,

1187
01:05:25,571 --> 01:05:28,330
like we cleaned them like once once a week
when I was like, whoa. I was like, Bro,

1188
01:05:28,331 --> 01:05:32,290
you got to clean these mats
with like disinfecting every
single training session.

1189
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:34,660
And they're like, all right, that's cool.
And I was like, how about that wall?

1190
01:05:34,661 --> 01:05:38,100
Like the padded wall? Like, oh no, we
never cleaned that. Like Bro, there be,

1191
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:39,040
they have no shirts on.

1192
01:05:39,041 --> 01:05:43,250
Their grappling with their backs on the
wall sweating all over the wall and they,

1193
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,460
I brought him,
brought it to their attention that listen,

1194
01:05:45,461 --> 01:05:47,110
everything needs to be cleaned in the gym.

1195
01:05:47,111 --> 01:05:51,500
How Bill Dana literally said you go
back and you watch like the box series.

1196
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:55,090
Like I still got as like DVD series like
and it's like literally Dana said like

1197
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:57,310
Delaguardia pretty much saved
the show, the whole, the whole,

1198
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:02,230
almost the whole both teams got staff.
I was like get the vans detail,

1199
01:06:02,231 --> 01:06:04,780
like get the vans Etl, clean the
mats, cleaned, stability balls.

1200
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,260
I made everybody get tea tree and
Eucalyptus soap, you know, it just,

1201
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:12,970
nobody was educated at the time about
it and it just, it's a plague man. It's,

1202
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:16,240
I, if I see anybody would
ring where more staff,

1203
01:06:16,241 --> 01:06:20,410
I literally light fucking bombs and the
gym and burn the fucking place down or a

1204
01:06:20,411 --> 01:06:23,860
new maps from zebra and rev gear.
It's so common.

1205
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:28,300
I was just reading one a Gordon Ryan's
posts on Instagram that he got Mercer for

1206
01:06:28,301 --> 01:06:32,350
the second time and that medication
resistant staph infection.

1207
01:06:32,351 --> 01:06:35,230
That's scares the shit out of me dude.
I had staff,

1208
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:38,230
I can't really claim Coty I'm
not going to blame you bro.

1209
01:06:38,231 --> 01:06:41,740
But it was oddly enough right around the
time we had Kobe had staff in his knee

1210
01:06:41,741 --> 01:06:42,420
and I was camping.
I'm,

1211
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:45,850
and I was very active at the time training
with these guys and I got staff onto

1212
01:06:45,851 --> 01:06:49,360
my armpit both fucking on pits.
I literally had,

1213
01:06:49,390 --> 01:06:51,490
I had to walk around like
with my arms up like this.

1214
01:06:51,491 --> 01:06:55,960
I had wicks coming out of them like nasty
dude staff has no good. They put wicks.

1215
01:06:55,961 --> 01:06:58,480
What they do is they actually,
they make an incision,

1216
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:01,960
they drain the abscess cause it's an
abscess essentially they drained the

1217
01:07:01,961 --> 01:07:04,210
abscess and then a packet with like,

1218
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:06,640
it literally looks like a
wick from like a lantern.

1219
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:11,140
It's like hollow in the middle cloth and
they pack it in and they leave just a

1220
01:07:11,141 --> 01:07:14,950
little tip out and as the wound
drains and heals, the wick comes out.

1221
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:20,670
So I had like these two inch like like
a tip on strange basically and wasn't

1222
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:25,390
medicated the, the no, they just, they
cleaned it out. They make an incision,

1223
01:07:25,391 --> 01:07:27,760
they cleaned it all out.
They flush it with saline and they,

1224
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:31,600
they pack it with a wick and they dope
you up with cal flex usually is the

1225
01:07:31,601 --> 01:07:33,220
weapon of choice for antibiotics I think.

1226
01:07:33,221 --> 01:07:35,630
Believe it's called Catholics and they a

1227
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:43,440
picture. He's too tired walking
upstairs like everything.

1228
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,720
That's when you see when guys fight
on that. I remember what's his name?

1229
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:49,690
Rockhold against Chris Weidman and
Kevin Lee recently to a member.

1230
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:53,800
We noticed it during the breakfast was
didn't take any medication specifically

1231
01:07:53,801 --> 01:07:56,270
because he knew it would zap has cardio.
Yeah.

1232
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:58,650
Well I'm sure the stabs
zapped him to period. Yeah.

1233
01:07:58,651 --> 01:08:00,720
But the antibiotics on top of it,
forget about it.

1234
01:08:00,721 --> 01:08:03,280
I remember when we called that fight,
you call that fight and I was like, dude,

1235
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:04,300
that's staff on us.

1236
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:07,710
And we were talking about it and it's
almost like the guys in the truck, like,

1237
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:08,750
I don't know,
I don't mention it though.

1238
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:13,120
When they told Daniel Cormier and not to
say anything unless they brought it up

1239
01:08:13,121 --> 01:08:16,100
to Carmax, her, I said, does that look any
staff too? And they're like, don't bring

1240
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,770
that up. That's definitely staff. Joe,

1241
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:24,410
you don't give a single fuck that guy.
He was like, what are you talking about?

1242
01:08:24,411 --> 01:08:27,600
Don't talk about that. Yeah, you got
it. It was, it was blatantly obvious.

1243
01:08:27,601 --> 01:08:31,550
So it was so obvious. How could anyone
say to not talk about, it's funny too,

1244
01:08:31,551 --> 01:08:34,030
because I don't think the commission is
supposed to allow you to fight if they,

1245
01:08:34,031 --> 01:08:37,550
if you got like a Herbie on your lip or
something funky or you got staffed bout

1246
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:42,340
scratch. So I was shocked because
it was so blatant. Yeah, exactly.

1247
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:45,810
Olin and he and I think a makeup on
it on the way and yeah, that's right.

1248
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:49,160
That's right. Yeah. Susie touched it
up a little bit, which is hilarious.

1249
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:54,050
She's complicit. Everyone's
involved. Susie is awesome. I've had,

1250
01:08:54,450 --> 01:08:57,530
I've had times where like, I've
had fighters like, oh my God,

1251
01:08:57,531 --> 01:09:00,420
he took a cut during the camp. Like
you're trying to kind of hide it. Yeah.

1252
01:09:01,410 --> 01:09:06,260
Hairbrush crazy. Yeah.
Kevin Lee. That was, uh,

1253
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:10,430
that was really unfortunate timing because
I wanted to see what would happen in

1254
01:09:10,431 --> 01:09:14,510
that fight. I mean, that was
a, you saw Kevin get Tony down.

1255
01:09:14,511 --> 01:09:16,550
He's beating him up on the ground.
I was just going to say,

1256
01:09:16,551 --> 01:09:20,930
who is he fucking is Ferguson.
He got his back dude cabs a style,

1257
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:26,580
you know,
fucking huge for 105 pounds.

1258
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:31,370
I, when he first emerged, like, and I was
watching him, I was like, I wasn't like,

1259
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:32,800
I want to say I wasn't impressed,
but I,

1260
01:09:32,801 --> 01:09:35,390
I had no idea like what
his capabilities were like,

1261
01:09:35,391 --> 01:09:37,670
and I started watching him fight and
I was like, dude, this guy's legit.

1262
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:42,050
He's in his prime. It's a how
old is he? He's 26. I think. Now

1263
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:48,230
he's the, he's very young. Final
hold. Kevin Lee is, I think, uh,

1264
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:53,000
I think he's a few years. I think he's
a few years from his prime. 25, 25. 25.

1265
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:57,620
20 bucks. A young dude that is
a young man, young, youngest
fuck smart as fuck too.

1266
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:01,700
In a month. He's 27. He's a cool
dude too. He's a very cool guy.

1267
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:06,020
I had him on my podcast and I think it
really changed people's perceptions of

1268
01:10:06,021 --> 01:10:06,111
him.

1269
01:10:06,111 --> 01:10:11,111
You realize how honest he is as open
and teligent and just really considerate

1270
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,540
and thinking about all the
various aspects of his career.

1271
01:10:14,541 --> 01:10:17,270
And even when he's talking
about like other fighters,

1272
01:10:17,271 --> 01:10:22,271
he wasn't shit talking necessarily where
it's like really just talking about his

1273
01:10:22,521 --> 01:10:25,090
own skills versus their skills and,

1274
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:28,250
and even Ferguson when he's talking
about Tony, he was saying, man,

1275
01:10:28,370 --> 01:10:32,240
this injury is a real bummer because
it's going to impede what he does.

1276
01:10:32,241 --> 01:10:34,370
Like his whole thing is that
he can do anything right.

1277
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,820
He's like loose and he takes chances.
Like if he's got this need,

1278
01:10:37,821 --> 01:10:41,480
it's fucked up that he doesn't trust like
that could really get, I'm like, Ooh,

1279
01:10:41,481 --> 01:10:44,570
that's a good point. Yeah. He's
got a knee that he doesn't trust.

1280
01:10:44,571 --> 01:10:47,940
It's going to keep him from being
is like freewheeling. You know?

1281
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:51,110
One of the things about Tony
is he's so unpredictable.

1282
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:56,620
Like how do you prepare for a guy that
just moves crazy and has knockout power

1283
01:10:57,381 --> 01:11:02,180
and Nadine endurance, he
trained with Eddie still. Yes.
Yes, he's still with Eddie.

1284
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:06,020
What a freak accident, man. Imagine
you're on your way to a fight.

1285
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:09,100
You're doing press and you,
you're going to talk to somebody.

1286
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:11,150
You trip over some wires.
Is that what it was?

1287
01:11:11,151 --> 01:11:13,270
A production wires like camera wise?
Yeah.

1288
01:11:13,271 --> 01:11:17,070
And UFC tonight and blew
the fucking, the, the,

1289
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:21,510
the ligament off the bone law.
You ever see the scar? I haven't.

1290
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:24,420
Oh my God. It's like a Hayley.
It's like a 12 inch scar.

1291
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:26,550
There was no previous injury or anything.

1292
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:30,660
So that literally just came out of
nowhere to fucking the wires and fell

1293
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:32,850
sideways and literally,
which is,

1294
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:37,050
how does a guy like that fall down
even you would think he's so athletic.

1295
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,660
I forget what it was.
Ordinate in the day we had,

1296
01:11:39,661 --> 01:11:44,280
remember when you used to do the UFC
workout rooms? Uh, they would put,

1297
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:48,990
oh man, he fucking scar.
It's like 80 staples. Yeah,

1298
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:52,440
it's nuts. It's one of the bigger needs
scarves I've ever seen in my life.

1299
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:57,510
That is nasty sky. Yeah. But now he's
uh, he's running around. He's moving.

1300
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,130
Yeah.
He's a freak man.

1301
01:11:59,290 --> 01:12:03,840
They were doing some UV light or something
like that on it. But you know, he's a,

1302
01:12:03,841 --> 01:12:07,590
he's starting to hit the bag again. He
throws kicks and punches on the bag now.

1303
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:10,020
We've lost fights in the past
for those of, you know, like,

1304
01:12:10,021 --> 01:12:12,570
I was just going to say we had those,
the, you know, the foldout maths,

1305
01:12:12,571 --> 01:12:15,840
like the bi fold maths or maybe like
somebody got their foot caught in it,

1306
01:12:15,841 --> 01:12:18,990
roll their ankle. It was like one show
a long time ago. And you know, uh,

1307
01:12:18,991 --> 01:12:19,880
we started talking about it.

1308
01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:24,120
I think it was a Jimmy Gifford works for
Lorenzo back at the time. Uh, I was like,

1309
01:12:24,121 --> 01:12:27,330
man, you need those dollars. Are those
rollout Maths d seems a no good man.

1310
01:12:27,331 --> 01:12:30,030
People are tweaking their ankles
left and right, man. We'd like,

1311
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:31,890
we'd lose a fight occasionally,
like backstage,

1312
01:12:31,891 --> 01:12:34,080
just I'm like somebody rolling in their
ankle in the cracks of the mats or

1313
01:12:34,081 --> 01:12:36,810
something stupid like that.
But what a freak accident to,

1314
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:40,230
to think like and how close he was
really close to that fight, wasn't he?

1315
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:44,700
He was a couple of days out.
Do you remember when, um,

1316
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:49,830
Kevin Randleman was backstage and he
stepped on some pipes and flew through the

1317
01:12:49,831 --> 01:12:54,780
air and land on his head and
knocked himself out back off stage.

1318
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:57,270
Scrapping for the main event of a fight.

1319
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:02,220
It was like UFC 13 or 14
or some shit or something.

1320
01:13:02,221 --> 01:13:05,290
He lost the main of it.
Lost the nightmare.

1321
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:08,400
I don't remember who he was supposed
to be fighting. I do not remember,

1322
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:13,410
but I remember Kevin Randleman stepped
on some pipes and fell and hit his

1323
01:13:13,411 --> 01:13:17,730
fucking head. Yeah, I remember. I remember
thinking what? Yeah, what are the odds?

1324
01:13:17,731 --> 01:13:21,630
I've maybe you're supposed to be fighting
Pedro his though I do not remember who

1325
01:13:21,631 --> 01:13:26,570
that's going way back. Randleman days is
gone. Was It Pedro? His Oh yeah. What,

1326
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:31,290
what, what, when did you
come on? Like 12, 1997.

1327
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:36,210
Was it does it with her at the time
or was it as CG? It was Bob Myerwitz.

1328
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:38,490
Campbell Mclaren hired me.
No,

1329
01:13:38,491 --> 01:13:42,570
she was Tony Blauer did it
before me and they needed a new,

1330
01:13:42,571 --> 01:13:47,210
a backstage interview or Guy Ufc 12?
Yeah,

1331
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:52,560
in Alabama Sun. We're supposed to be in
buffalo. It's supposed to fly to Buffalo,

1332
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:55,110
New York, and, or Albany
somewhere in New York.

1333
01:13:55,111 --> 01:13:58,560
But New York state made it illegal like
right before. So they had a change.

1334
01:13:58,561 --> 01:14:03,450
All the flights move the octagon
flying down to Dothan, Alabama. Yeah.

1335
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:08,220
Puddle jumper. Plane. Yeah.
Yeah. I remember those days.

1336
01:14:08,221 --> 01:14:10,080
I was not involved with the
company at the time. I got,

1337
01:14:10,081 --> 01:14:11,980
I think the first fight I cornered was

1338
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:16,060
like UFC 36 or something
like that. But that was it.

1339
01:14:16,061 --> 01:14:19,900
That's early in the day
to UFC 35 and a half.

1340
01:14:19,950 --> 01:14:23,270
It was when I came back. Yeah.
That's what I did. My first comic.

1341
01:14:23,730 --> 01:14:26,710
Who's the first versus Vittorio,
what I did,

1342
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,880
who's the owner of that sounds
at heart Davie and was like,

1343
01:14:28,910 --> 01:14:32,750
I think Davies was one of
the original guys. Yeah. Uh,

1344
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:36,830
he was a part of seg. Yeah,
it was art Davies. Uh,

1345
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:41,320
Bob Meyrowitz. Yeah. And I guess
Horian Gracie was involved in the very,

1346
01:14:41,321 --> 01:14:45,160
very beginning. I remember we did the
20 years, Ufa, 20 years, whatever.

1347
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:47,650
Like we're backstage will
coming in to the, uh,

1348
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:50,830
to the MGM in the back of the
arena. And you know, uh, you know,

1349
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:54,550
everybody's pulling up. You know, I got
the Ferrari's Lambo is caught up in out,

1350
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,130
Davie pulls up in a fucking Saturday.
And then I was like, oh boy,

1351
01:14:57,131 --> 01:15:01,300
you have time changed. Times
have changed. Like a busted,

1352
01:15:01,301 --> 01:15:05,290
like Nevada plate you didn't get,
Oh man.

1353
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:10,690
Missed the boat was like fuck,
times have definitely changed.

1354
01:15:10,691 --> 01:15:15,691
Lambo is Ferrari's like black SUV
and then a Saturn reiki racket

1355
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:19,750
come squeaking. I'll see
body dude though. I like,

1356
01:15:19,770 --> 01:15:23,410
Hey [inaudible] bought the UFC for $2
million, right? I don't think of that.

1357
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:26,040
And they,
what 4 billion was the sale price.

1358
01:15:26,050 --> 01:15:30,640
Talking about profit on return or return
of investment, but is a long time.

1359
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:35,830
And when they bought it in 2001 and you
can imagine how much money the Fertittas

1360
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:38,290
Lorenzo and frank and Dana, they are,
how much money they put into, you know,

1361
01:15:38,291 --> 01:15:39,380
so yeah,

1362
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:42,730
it's not like they bought it for a clean
two mill and had smooth sailing and

1363
01:15:42,731 --> 01:15:43,720
then sold out,
you know,

1364
01:15:43,930 --> 01:15:48,620
well they were in the hole for $40
million by the time 2005 roll out.

1365
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:53,820
So 2005 was the first season
of the ultimate fighter
and they were in the whole

1366
01:15:54,041 --> 01:15:56,770
$40 million while they were doing,

1367
01:15:56,771 --> 01:15:59,530
while they're in production and
they were trying to sell the,

1368
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:04,560
they were trying to sell the UFC and
Lorenzo called Dana the next day and said,

1369
01:16:04,871 --> 01:16:07,390
fuck it. Let's just keep going.
Yeah. Like he was saying like,

1370
01:16:07,391 --> 01:16:10,290
see if anybody wants to buy it. And they'd
decided, fuck it. Let's just keep going.

1371
01:16:10,470 --> 01:16:13,420
I'm glad he did. Here we are. Yeah. Yeah.

1372
01:16:13,421 --> 01:16:15,580
But you got to think that the number,

1373
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:21,150
the amount of money they have to make
every month just to make the nut on 4

1374
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:25,120
billion. Exactly. Yeah. It's
not an easy company to run.
I can imagine. Yeah. I mean,

1375
01:16:25,121 --> 01:16:28,930
I don't really talk to Ari much when
he's back there and I just say hi,

1376
01:16:28,931 --> 01:16:29,681
shake his hand,

1377
01:16:29,681 --> 01:16:34,300
but I don't know how well it's doing.

1378
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:37,960
I've never met him. I just miss them.
Actually in Dubai. It was Lorenzo from me,

1379
01:16:37,961 --> 01:16:41,730
a fucking big lay up and sent me over
to Dubai to train od Prince. Tada. Noon.

1380
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:46,050
You've trained him several times, right?
Uh, I had one trip I spent about a month.

1381
01:16:46,051 --> 01:16:46,201
Yeah.

1382
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:49,150
But I ended up just instead of teaching
them Moitai just ended up doing Jujitsu.

1383
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:51,280
It Marcella gas here everyday,
which was fucking awesome.

1384
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:53,000
I show up in Dubai like do not,

1385
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:55,780
it was funny because he got off the plane
the first they send me airline tickets.

1386
01:16:55,990 --> 01:16:58,190
Learns is like, Hey you want
to go to Dubai? You know,
train, train, talk to him.

1387
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:00,580
I it's absolutely right.
Yeah, it was Abu Dhabi. Dubai.

1388
01:17:00,581 --> 01:17:03,250
I'm telling you I would not be, but
Dubai is like right there. So you know,

1389
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:05,860
so going out with Dobie like I got
the airline tickets, I was like,

1390
01:17:05,861 --> 01:17:10,070
what the fuck is this ets something
airlines and listen bullshit flying some

1391
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:12,950
fucking weird. Ilana and I looked
it up and I was like, Oh shit.

1392
01:17:12,951 --> 01:17:17,450
It's like gold toilets and shit. And I
looked in my and I told him, I was like,

1393
01:17:17,451 --> 01:17:19,730
I need them to assist them to go at me.
Like you may have an assistant.

1394
01:17:19,731 --> 01:17:22,580
Then I was like, perfect. I looked
and it was nine grand each a ticket.

1395
01:17:22,581 --> 01:17:26,480
It's like 18 grand. Felt like the
flights, it wasn't like full beds,

1396
01:17:26,481 --> 01:17:31,160
like little capsules. You can get fleas
and shit. And we got there, there was a,

1397
01:17:31,170 --> 01:17:34,310
there was nobody at the airport. And I'm
like, fuck dude, I don't know who to call,

1398
01:17:34,311 --> 01:17:36,620
what's going on. I have no idea. Right.

1399
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:39,050
Some guy walks over to
me and he hands me a box,

1400
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:42,050
a mobile phone and I opened
the box and as a funny goes,

1401
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:45,570
the phone would ring when he needs
you. And I was like, what does this,

1402
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:49,100
and then a seven series,
so check this out,

1403
01:17:49,101 --> 01:17:53,450
a stretched out seven series BMW comes
and like the guys like, you know,

1404
01:17:53,451 --> 01:17:54,500
he comes over,
he grabbed my bag,

1405
01:17:54,501 --> 01:17:58,490
he puts him in and he takes us to
a place called the twin towers.

1406
01:17:58,491 --> 01:18:02,300
You motherfuckers, oddly enough, right
after nine 11, I'm like, oh, I get it.

1407
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:06,170
Fucking twin tower is fucking put the
American guys up in the twin towers and

1408
01:18:06,171 --> 01:18:09,200
like we get the end of the middle
of the night. Me and my buddy Neil,

1409
01:18:09,201 --> 01:18:11,700
one of my students at the time
and the Ligo, we ended up um,

1410
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:14,390
going up to the room and they was like
nothing. Then I was like, no furniture,

1411
01:18:14,391 --> 01:18:15,890
like the beds where it
wasn't like a hotel.

1412
01:18:15,891 --> 01:18:18,140
It's like an apartment because we were
going to be there for a month and I was

1413
01:18:18,141 --> 01:18:18,951
like,
dude,

1414
01:18:18,951 --> 01:18:22,520
is it like a fucking target open right
now and get some bed sheets and stuff.

1415
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:25,340
I need like soap I need. Like she
like it, there was nothing there.

1416
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:29,450
And we literally sat in that apartment
going across the street to the market

1417
01:18:29,451 --> 01:18:33,590
will be the only white dudes in the
market just getting like cans of like tuna

1418
01:18:33,591 --> 01:18:36,260
in olive oil and like
bread just to dip it in.

1419
01:18:36,261 --> 01:18:38,480
We would like survive
in for like two days,

1420
01:18:38,481 --> 01:18:41,930
just staring at the fucking phone every
day. Like he's gonna fucking ring.

1421
01:18:41,931 --> 01:18:44,720
I know what's going provide
fool. Listen. So then,

1422
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:48,710
so then the phone rang and he said,
I'd, there'll be a driver outside.

1423
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:51,320
You know when you get there, like when go
downstairs, they'll be a driver outside,

1424
01:18:51,321 --> 01:18:52,061
you're going to go to the palace.

1425
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:54,770
So we'd go downstairs as driver outside
and he gives us the whole rundown about

1426
01:18:55,070 --> 01:18:56,510
do not make eye contact with a prince,

1427
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:58,910
only called him in Sinus and this
and that. And I'm like, dude,

1428
01:18:58,911 --> 01:19:01,980
this is trippy as fuck dude.
You got to do Jujitsu with this guy.

1429
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,350
So now I'm supposed to
train him in boy ty,

1430
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:06,650
he wants to learn Moitai cause you say
yes. Lorenzo. He asked Lorenzo like,

1431
01:19:06,651 --> 01:19:07,560
you know,
you know who do,

1432
01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:09,490
who you do when we tie what I was
wondering about when we tie solar,

1433
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,940
Renzel mentioned me and
that's how I got over there.

1434
01:19:10,941 --> 01:19:15,650
So I get to the palace and I show up in
the work and this workout room and uh,

1435
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,720
I'm just sitting there, I'm
like, dude, this is so weird.

1436
01:19:17,721 --> 01:19:21,560
Like w no one's telling us what's going
on in Marcello Garcia walks in with a

1437
01:19:21,561 --> 01:19:24,470
gym bag and was like, holy fucking
shit. That's how I got to see it.

1438
01:19:24,830 --> 01:19:26,750
We ended up like a ton
of new and came out.

1439
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:29,420
His hind is talking and came out and we
did a little bit of more time but his

1440
01:19:29,421 --> 01:19:33,370
passion for Jujitsu was so overwhelming
that it's Ali wanted to do is do Jujitsu

1441
01:19:33,371 --> 01:19:35,480
and he's like, do you like to do too?
And I was like, I love Jews. He's like,

1442
01:19:35,490 --> 01:19:36,323
let's do Jujitsu.

1443
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:41,540
I ended up training everyday what Marcella
Garcia for like a month straight and

1444
01:19:41,541 --> 01:19:45,260
we did like maybe we did like maybe in
a month's time we did like maybe three

1445
01:19:45,261 --> 01:19:46,094
hours and when we tie.

1446
01:19:46,730 --> 01:19:50,060
Yeah and then as like going back to
the Irish story as I was leaving,

1447
01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:53,350
like I think Ari was coming in
doing some type of business with,

1448
01:19:53,351 --> 01:19:56,330
with his highness at the time or
something. So we just missed each other.

1449
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:58,450
That was my,
my point to tell you about Aria,

1450
01:19:58,810 --> 01:20:00,860
like hanging out with
cause all that eye contact.

1451
01:20:00,861 --> 01:20:05,000
She had seems to go out the window once.
Yeah. Once you, once you get to know him,

1452
01:20:05,001 --> 01:20:06,440
once I got to know him and you know,

1453
01:20:06,441 --> 01:20:07,980
I've got a little more
comfortable around them. Like

1454
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:11,540
he was super cool, like super cool
dude. Really intense dude man.

1455
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:15,030
Like everything to the extreme.
Like I want to hike Mt. Everest.

1456
01:20:15,031 --> 01:20:17,010
He hikes fucking Mount
Everest. He's like, aw dude.

1457
01:20:17,011 --> 01:20:20,700
Everything like he said he had like an uh,
the Cha,

1458
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:24,620
what's the elevation chamber like the
elevation 10th and stuff like that. Yeah,

1459
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:27,540
just everything he does.
Anything he did was like to the extreme.

1460
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:30,560
I mean obviously like you're talking
like a, an extreme do at a trillionaire.

1461
01:20:30,561 --> 01:20:31,201
Like you can do anything.

1462
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:35,010
He wants to let trillionaire Trilly
and this is the other half peach.

1463
01:20:35,011 --> 01:20:38,130
Brilliant people don't understand. When
you hear about the world's richest men,

1464
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:42,430
those are people with public
incomes. Yeah. This is not, yeah,

1465
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:45,750
he's of above and beyond fucking forums.
500.

1466
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:49,770
He's literally a prince.
He was funny.

1467
01:20:49,771 --> 01:20:53,370
He told me his story about how Hanzo and
I've live laughed at this weight. Enzo,

1468
01:20:53,371 --> 01:20:54,030
Enzo.
Uh,

1469
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:58,740
they had this big horse race that they
do when they race across the desert and,

1470
01:20:58,741 --> 01:21:01,920
uh, they needed another ride and you
do it like with no saddle or something.

1471
01:21:01,921 --> 01:21:06,180
It's this crazy like long lake, 20, 30
mile horse race or something like that.

1472
01:21:06,181 --> 01:21:07,590
And I don't know the details of it,

1473
01:21:07,591 --> 01:21:11,160
but Henzel was there at the time and they
were like, uh, we need another rider.

1474
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:13,560
And then it was like, fuck it, I'll
ride. And they're like, no bro,

1475
01:21:13,561 --> 01:21:14,161
you don't understand.

1476
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:17,610
Like it's like you got like a fucking
scarf around your throat and you're like,

1477
01:21:17,611 --> 01:21:20,520
just get on a horse and you go for
like whatever it is, how long it is.

1478
01:21:20,521 --> 01:21:24,450
And Hanzo did the race. He likes,
survived the race. It was crazy. Yeah.

1479
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:25,940
Ask him about it sometime.
It's funny,

1480
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:30,910
I saw that 51 I was saying to myself,
what's he doing?

1481
01:21:30,910 --> 01:21:33,260
Like is he gonna he's gonna fight it
and he's really doing this like at first

1482
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:36,780
key condo and he took his back with a,

1483
01:21:36,781 --> 01:21:39,840
took him down with a very
slick move. Yeah, yeah. He,

1484
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:44,900
he hooked the leg and then went through
the underside and butterflied the back

1485
01:21:46,561 --> 01:21:50,130
of the other leg and drag them down. I
saw the finish. I didn't see the fight.

1486
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:52,130
How long did the fight last? It
wasn't that long first. Yeah,

1487
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:57,140
the first round and second Hanzo still
getting added honey go up earlier than

1488
01:21:58,861 --> 01:22:02,300
this. You can see the, the actual
take cause it takedown slick. Yup.

1489
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:06,570
So he dives in and a very dangerous guy,

1490
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:11,580
Yukon Yuki Kondo stops Sahlu he
barrow like Yuki Kondo was a beast.

1491
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:16,050
Vicious, vicious fucking
striker. But you know,

1492
01:22:16,051 --> 01:22:20,730
also 50 years old himself think so.
Hanzo gets a single,

1493
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,620
takes the same trip.

1494
01:22:22,710 --> 01:22:27,120
You'll see that and butterflies
the the opposite leg.

1495
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:31,830
That is a, I love that. Masta
Henzel Gracie. Unbelievable man.

1496
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:36,820
Such a great person. Great. Jujitsu has
been an inspiration to us all. Is this,

1497
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:41,700
he's 51 with his body. He doesn't, it
doesn't look like he's juice to the tits.

1498
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:44,250
You know, once he's in this position
right now, he's got his back. He's like,

1499
01:22:44,251 --> 01:22:48,120
I got you motherfucker. And so it gets on
your back. And that's how we're wrapped.

1500
01:22:48,150 --> 01:22:51,880
Pretty much. Yeah. And condo was
always a striker. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

1501
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:56,520
Is this like 50 50 year old division
going to manifest something?

1502
01:22:56,521 --> 01:22:58,950
They like talking about this master's
league or something like that?

1503
01:22:58,951 --> 01:23:03,450
Is it actually going to manifest? I don't
know, man. But in Japan, you know Japan,

1504
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:05,010
they'll have anybody fight.
Yeah.

1505
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:10,480
Gabby Garcia fight old housewives.
They don't give a fuck.

1506
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:13,810
They have grandma's fighting Japan.
They'll do anything.

1507
01:23:13,811 --> 01:23:18,300
And then what they're doing and what an
IFC, I mean, they're basically, look,

1508
01:23:18,350 --> 01:23:22,960
they're rehabilitating careers. I
mean, look at fucking Brandon Vera.

1509
01:23:22,990 --> 01:23:27,820
Brandon Vera is a monster over
there. That's right. Yeah. Dude,

1510
01:23:27,970 --> 01:23:31,270
you ever see what he looks like now? I
haven't even followed it in a while. Yeah,

1511
01:23:31,330 --> 01:23:35,620
he looks like a poster boy for
Usada Sniff test. Oh Shit. Gigantic.

1512
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:40,780
His neck starts at the top of his head.
He's Yo, he's a huge heavyweight now.

1513
01:23:40,810 --> 01:23:43,660
He was always big, but he's yoked
up now. Oh yeah, dude. He's,

1514
01:23:43,661 --> 01:23:47,710
he's for sure on Mexican supplements
and good for him. Go for it.

1515
01:23:47,930 --> 01:23:51,520
It's got that too on a test.
I don't know what a look.

1516
01:23:51,521 --> 01:23:55,750
See if you can find a video
of him fighting because he
looks like a fucking go.

1517
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:59,050
Really now. What does it say he
weighs? Was does a say there?

1518
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:04,270
He was only four years old at age 46.
Four six to two 30.

1519
01:24:04,271 --> 01:24:07,090
It says then he was a very light to 50.

1520
01:24:07,091 --> 01:24:12,040
Now 59 yeah. See, see if
he can find a video of him.

1521
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:16,960
Go that. Yeah. Get go deep into
the fight. You see how big he is?

1522
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:21,820
Oh, he's so big. He has a pig.
He's a real heavyweight now.

1523
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:25,960
He's a, is he living in Asiana weird
that I don't think so originally.

1524
01:24:25,961 --> 01:24:30,910
Still Right. He's still San
Diego had kicked from hell. Yeah.

1525
01:24:30,911 --> 01:24:35,680
Dude, he's a monster. His chits is
good to dean. Lister gets us on. Well,

1526
01:24:35,681 --> 01:24:39,580
um, I think he started with Lloyd
Irvin. Okay. Yep. You're right. Yeah,

1527
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:42,480
I mean he's been, he's gone
to a bunch of camps. Yeah.

1528
01:24:42,910 --> 01:24:46,150
I had a chance to train with him when
he was at Eddie's place at the old bomb

1529
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:49,600
squad. He came in and it was
before he fought in the UFC.

1530
01:24:49,870 --> 01:24:52,450
And I remember saying to him like, what
way do you find in it? And he's like,

1531
01:24:52,451 --> 01:24:55,420
heavy weight. And I was like, wow.
He didn't look like a big guy.

1532
01:24:55,450 --> 01:24:58,360
He wasn't a big hip. No, he's
very light for a heavyweight.

1533
01:24:58,361 --> 01:25:01,470
But he was fucking people up
because he was your mentor.

1534
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:03,110
I think he trained with
two and say Rob Cayman.

1535
01:25:03,190 --> 01:25:08,190
Rob came in and rob Kamins guy for a
while and then him and rob had a dispute

1536
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:13,150
about, you know, percentage payments
or something like that. You know,

1537
01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:15,970
there was a kid though that I
think managed them in my area.

1538
01:25:15,971 --> 01:25:19,020
I forget his name back in the day, but
he, uh, he had some money issues too.

1539
01:25:19,290 --> 01:25:24,100
I don't know what happened with rob. Rob
Vanished. Never see him and yeah, man,

1540
01:25:24,101 --> 01:25:27,610
it's funny. He was like, he, he was
around for a while and he disappeared.

1541
01:25:27,610 --> 01:25:29,860
Then he'd come back around for a
while and then before you know it,

1542
01:25:29,861 --> 01:25:33,070
I saw him like fucking eating fucking
space cake on Instagram in Holland.

1543
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:36,970
I was like, I guess he's in Holland.
Not like, I don't think so. Yeah.

1544
01:25:36,971 --> 01:25:39,820
I think he had like just some ups and
downs in his life and he just needed to

1545
01:25:39,821 --> 01:25:41,500
get the fuck out.
Just go back to his roots.

1546
01:25:41,501 --> 01:25:46,501
I saw him like videos like him in like
a field like frolicking and fucking off

1547
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:48,550
like my man rob.

1548
01:25:48,990 --> 01:25:53,990
He though some thing that he was putting
together like came in one oh one some

1549
01:25:54,191 --> 01:25:57,760
workout. Yeah. Yup, Yup. He was,

1550
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:00,910
he was nasty back in the day, man.
He was like one of the first uh,

1551
01:26:00,940 --> 01:26:04,130
foreigners that Korea Tang of the
CEO, Tom Camp Lake. I remember

1552
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:07,810
the Duke Roufus on the podcast years ago
was talking about rob came in and see a

1553
01:26:07,811 --> 01:26:11,930
tongue. He was like one of our first
like foreign foreign superstars.

1554
01:26:11,931 --> 01:26:15,860
Like you know him Rehmann Deca
those guys done a big guy too for,

1555
01:26:15,861 --> 01:26:20,700
for a guy that was fighting the ties.
He was not a little bit about him.

1556
01:26:20,701 --> 01:26:23,780
And two as a southpaw, he would
attack the back leg a lot. Oh yeah.

1557
01:26:24,450 --> 01:26:29,340
That's the worst way to take us.
He would do that slight step to the side.

1558
01:26:29,341 --> 01:26:33,150
Go across both legs.
Oh,

1559
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:37,670
right across the three jet [inaudible]
what is that? What he's saying? Hood.

1560
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:42,950
Hood. Hood hurt Jeb. Jeb like je be dead.

1561
01:26:43,550 --> 01:26:47,720
What does that mean? She gets
hurt. Jet. Yeah. Hurt Jeb. Hawaii.

1562
01:26:48,290 --> 01:26:51,080
If I say Jeb, that means heard.
If I want to say it hurts a lot.

1563
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:55,700
I say mock like my name, mock
check mark. Like happy Dji,

1564
01:26:55,850 --> 01:26:59,770
very happy. Dhi Mac. And then you
can throw the type thing but oh,

1565
01:26:59,771 --> 01:27:03,830
Dji Macklin.
Could you read tie?

1566
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:07,400
I'm just now my brother Joshua who is a,
one of my students back home,

1567
01:27:07,401 --> 01:27:10,370
he's a Buddhist monk. A white dude
with a man bond drives a jeep.

1568
01:27:10,371 --> 01:27:11,460
Like you'd never know.
He's like,

1569
01:27:14,690 --> 01:27:18,020
he's teaching me how to, how to read
and write, you know, I can speak.

1570
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:19,710
I knew I could speak.
Uh,

1571
01:27:19,730 --> 01:27:22,340
I knew I could speak Thai pretty well
when I actually started talking to people

1572
01:27:22,341 --> 01:27:22,791
on the phone,

1573
01:27:22,791 --> 01:27:25,080
like people from Thailand on the phone
because if I'm in front of you like,

1574
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:29,570
and it's like any language, like you
go, like you fly, like what time?

1575
01:27:29,571 --> 01:27:32,470
Like you can fucking caveman language
and you can figure it out, you know?

1576
01:27:32,990 --> 01:27:35,690
But once I started talking to like Thai
friends on the phone, I was like, dude,

1577
01:27:35,691 --> 01:27:38,780
I got this. Like I'm not using
like my, my hand signs and whatnot.

1578
01:27:39,010 --> 01:27:42,230
So if you had to say someone in Thai,

1579
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:45,920
like the weigh ins are today,
but it's not the real way in.

1580
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:49,640
It's a ceremonial way, in the
real way. And started at 8:00 AM,

1581
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:54,500
what would you say the ties don't
even go that far. That's way too much.

1582
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:59,510
Really? Yeah, Dude. Like
it dude. I'll explain.

1583
01:27:59,570 --> 01:28:01,310
I'll explain Thailand, which
you right now. You Ready?

1584
01:28:01,311 --> 01:28:05,840
Let's take the verb to like or like you
like something chop karate. Chop Chop,

1585
01:28:05,850 --> 01:28:10,450
right? I like, okay. I take
the word Mai Mai right.

1586
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:13,850
If I put it before it a fight. If I
want to ask you if you like something,

1587
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:17,570
I just say Chop my,
that means mine is at the end.

1588
01:28:17,571 --> 01:28:21,980
That's I'm asking you a question.
Chop like my do you like if you like it,

1589
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:25,970
you say chop, right? If you don't like
it, you put the mind in front of my shop.

1590
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:30,020
It's literally like, like no,
like fucking cave language.

1591
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:34,580
So if I'm like, all right, you
know, take the word, like I said,

1592
01:28:34,590 --> 01:28:39,170
like go like bye bye means go right by my,

1593
01:28:39,290 --> 01:28:43,420
are you going Mike? By not going.
If you're going to just go by,

1594
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:46,940
that's, that's the crash
course of time right there.

1595
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:49,430
But the best in the kingdom Bro,
is knowing the tie glitch.

1596
01:28:49,431 --> 01:28:52,340
Me and my trainer crew toys see a
tongue. The son of Koreatown, uh,

1597
01:28:52,370 --> 01:28:55,790
always taught me English because it was
the fastest way from a to B. It's like,

1598
01:28:55,791 --> 01:28:59,660
all right, if you want to say water,
like it's nom, but rather than say nam,

1599
01:28:59,661 --> 01:29:02,100
you just say what the, I'm like, Oh shit.

1600
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:05,610
Like airports and Ambien just go airport.

1601
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:12,040
So they know what they, oh dude, if I,

1602
01:29:12,041 --> 01:29:15,270
if you say [inaudible] and you
say it like with the wrong tone,

1603
01:29:15,510 --> 01:29:18,900
like it's something different.
Like it's like the word my, my,

1604
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:22,250
my dog horse come.
Oh Jesus.

1605
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:25,920
That's why you can really get fucked
up trying to speak Thai in Thailand.

1606
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:28,370
That's why I teach all my
students and CrashCourse Bro.

1607
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:31,950
Tagless like you want water? What
the, you want to go the airport app,

1608
01:29:31,951 --> 01:29:36,680
hot passport, passport.
You just have to say it.

1609
01:29:36,910 --> 01:29:41,010
Just say it. It's literally like
you almost like mocking them like,

1610
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:45,480
but you're not like they get it right
away. Oh, that's so strange. It's weird.

1611
01:29:45,481 --> 01:29:48,000
Like I've had like literally people
like, dude, like don't hit it.

1612
01:29:48,001 --> 01:29:51,220
You're like fucking ranking
on the guy. Like, no, I'm
not dude. I'm talking to him.

1613
01:29:52,370 --> 01:29:56,440
They, they all spoke English
almost everybody for the
most part nowadays. Yeah.

1614
01:29:56,500 --> 01:30:00,090
Yeah. Nowadays for the most part,
yeah. Everybody speaks depending on go,

1615
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:05,160
it was more, it was more difficult to
communicate. Well there was less tourists,

1616
01:30:05,161 --> 01:30:10,050
you know, and now you know,
it's over. It's plagued with
like Germans and Russians.

1617
01:30:10,051 --> 01:30:11,520
I was like,
everybody's going to Thailand.

1618
01:30:11,910 --> 01:30:14,340
I saw a Ferrari driving down the
street for the first time ever.

1619
01:30:14,341 --> 01:30:17,940
Like a couple of years go in town.
I was like a fucking Ferrari in a city.

1620
01:30:17,941 --> 01:30:22,200
Thailand, it's all Russian money. Like a
lot of big Russian money, you know? Yeah.

1621
01:30:22,201 --> 01:30:27,030
There's a lot of like gangster activity
specifically like Russian, like Dutch,

1622
01:30:27,031 --> 01:30:31,610
Russian. Yeah. What are they doing
over there? I Dunno. I Dunno.

1623
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:33,360
Seller selling.

1624
01:30:33,361 --> 01:30:37,530
People I don't fucking know can buy a
liver for fucking 500 baht in the street.

1625
01:30:37,620 --> 01:30:39,690
Like I dunno bro.
I don't know.

1626
01:30:39,691 --> 01:30:43,800
But I definitely know that there was a
time when I was going to Thailand and it

1627
01:30:43,801 --> 01:30:46,530
felt like Thailand and then I
went back once and it was like,

1628
01:30:46,710 --> 01:30:50,010
like everybody was speaking Russian
and it was like white dudes everywhere.

1629
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:53,220
And I'm like all for wrong,
like all foreigners. And I
was like, I think Russian.

1630
01:30:53,221 --> 01:30:55,560
Why do you think,
I don't know what's a lot of,

1631
01:30:55,590 --> 01:30:59,040
a lot of a European vacation in Thailand
too. You know, it's like we go to,

1632
01:30:59,041 --> 01:31:02,790
like in America we go to like
a Roomba, Bahamas, Jamaica.
Like that's our vacation.

1633
01:31:03,230 --> 01:31:07,260
Like the Brits, like from the UK, they
could go to this go holiday in Thailand,

1634
01:31:07,261 --> 01:31:09,450
you know, they go to tie that
Australians, they go to Thailand,

1635
01:31:09,451 --> 01:31:12,690
like they go to Southeast Asia. So
it's just, I dunno, just a, it's a,

1636
01:31:12,691 --> 01:31:14,650
it's a big tourist attraction
in Thailand. Pho, Pho,

1637
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:16,920
pho for Europeans and funnel Russians.

1638
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:21,980
I saw a lot of older European or
American looking men with hot young Thai

1639
01:31:24,421 --> 01:31:26,610
checks. Yep, absolutely. I was like,

1640
01:31:26,611 --> 01:31:29,430
look at the mock really cheap.

1641
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:34,680
You get a,
you get a fucking great deal over there.

1642
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:39,720
They run specials like, yeah.
Now you see it all the time.

1643
01:31:39,721 --> 01:31:43,920
The worst is like the fat German guy in
the fucking man Thong walking down the

1644
01:31:43,921 --> 01:31:48,300
street and it would have fucking little
boy like a 14 year old boy. Oh Dude.

1645
01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:53,070
I've seen some weird shit in Thailand man.
As I said earlier in Atlanta smiles,

1646
01:31:53,071 --> 01:31:58,071
but this does not always smiles worse if
it's a 14 year old boy versus a 14 year

1647
01:31:58,801 --> 01:32:03,100
old is it?
It's all the same at that point.

1648
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:05,500
I don't know man. I don't
think, I dunno. Worse.

1649
01:32:05,530 --> 01:32:07,570
I think the 14 year old boy
probably take it better.

1650
01:32:09,550 --> 01:32:13,570
I never thought of that then I don't
want to probably less scarring if that's

1651
01:32:13,571 --> 01:32:16,570
what he's into. So you don't see a
lot of that shit up in Chiang Mai.

1652
01:32:16,571 --> 01:32:17,940
Like it's not like you,

1653
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:22,680
you were more like the elephant country
and like that's real Thailand to me like

1654
01:32:22,690 --> 01:32:26,380
that, that Chiang Mai, that northern
Thailand is like the real Thai culture,

1655
01:32:26,530 --> 01:32:30,160
you know. And then you as you go
down south you get more touristy,

1656
01:32:30,161 --> 01:32:33,810
you get more of a freak shows. You got
elephants were everywhere in terms of art.

1657
01:32:33,890 --> 01:32:36,200
Yep. Elephant Park, huge prevalent.

1658
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:40,490
It's very prevalent and tie cogens it's
the Southeast Asia that's, that's the,

1659
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:44,650
the, the fucking animal God.
Like that's it. Like the
elephants, everything to them.

1660
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:49,070
The Thai Thai box and started,
well at first it was a,
what they call [inaudible],

1661
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:52,390
which is known as a in Thailand is a
fan dab, which means like long short,

1662
01:32:52,391 --> 01:32:56,620
and that's the old to you see of sword
play, like the ties use and swords.

1663
01:32:56,621 --> 01:33:00,820
And they dressed up these elephants and
like Amr and like road baskets and just

1664
01:33:00,850 --> 01:33:03,520
shot arrows from, from, from
the top of the elephant.

1665
01:33:03,521 --> 01:33:07,030
So the elephant has always been a huge
part of that. Even in warfare. Yeah.

1666
01:33:07,031 --> 01:33:10,040
They use the elephants
in, in combat. Yeah. Yeah.

1667
01:33:10,110 --> 01:33:14,620
So they would like put these armor plates
on the trunks of the elephants in the

1668
01:33:14,621 --> 01:33:15,520
body of the elephants,

1669
01:33:15,521 --> 01:33:19,810
and they would put baskets on them and
they would just go off in a battlefield

1670
01:33:19,811 --> 01:33:24,010
and just be plucking people with arrows
and just dropping spears on them.

1671
01:33:24,011 --> 01:33:28,570
So the elephant was always prevalent
to the success of Thai culture.

1672
01:33:29,330 --> 01:33:32,130
You imagine going a battle
riding a fucking elephant.

1673
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:34,260
It's something up there in the
Internet. Would fucking, well,

1674
01:33:34,261 --> 01:33:38,620
was that all elephants? 300 something
like that. Yeah. There you go. Right?

1675
01:33:38,650 --> 01:33:41,270
There you go. There you
go. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1676
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:44,110
The ties were doing that shit against
the Burmese. Like back in the day,

1677
01:33:44,150 --> 01:33:49,150
they'd dress mellow fucking war with a
bunch of come towards you on elephants.

1678
01:33:51,010 --> 01:33:55,330
A giant fucking horse like coming at me
is one thing, but an elephant like, ah,

1679
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:58,630
dude, we're out numbered here. We've
got to fight them. They're so big, man.

1680
01:33:59,230 --> 01:34:02,680
I was so nervous around them big time.
It's weird.

1681
01:34:02,950 --> 01:34:06,490
We went to a place that rehabilitates
them and they reintroduce them back into

1682
01:34:06,491 --> 01:34:11,020
the wild. Yeah, it's a, you didn't
write it though. I think you did.

1683
01:34:11,021 --> 01:34:14,530
I didn't like it though. Yeah, I just
didn't think it was necessary. Right.

1684
01:34:14,531 --> 01:34:16,090
It's like this thing
doesn't want me to ride it.

1685
01:34:16,610 --> 01:34:20,290
A Lincoln rejects that King
of Sam's offer of elephants.

1686
01:34:20,291 --> 01:34:23,360
This is an 1862 civil war.
Abraham Lincoln.

1687
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:27,060
Oh, find that candles. War found that
camera thing the other day and I was like,

1688
01:34:27,061 --> 01:34:30,690
I wonder if they used them here.
What? Camels. I just, yeah,

1689
01:34:30,691 --> 01:34:33,480
I found something the other day when
we were talking about something and I

1690
01:34:33,481 --> 01:34:37,560
stumbled across another article that said
there were camels in the west and they

1691
01:34:37,561 --> 01:34:41,220
used him to travel. You can carry
things to help develop the west.

1692
01:34:41,290 --> 01:34:44,360
At some point they abandoned
them and there was like a, uh,

1693
01:34:44,730 --> 01:34:45,690
they call them the red ghost.

1694
01:34:45,691 --> 01:34:49,080
It was like a myth of this mythical
animal that was 30 feet tall,

1695
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:51,600
supposedly eight grizzly bears,
like I told you.

1696
01:34:51,601 --> 01:34:54,190
And like that was a camel
and ended up being a camel.

1697
01:34:54,210 --> 01:34:56,580
Yet people are just shooting them on site
because they didn't know what it was.

1698
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:58,070
Is Is Lincoln pointed

1699
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:02,390
out that steam power had already taken
the need for heavy animal power was just

1700
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:05,540
gonna say the train. That's the railroad
system coming into play right there.

1701
01:35:05,541 --> 01:35:08,120
They like Lincoln was like, fuck you and
your elephants man. We've got trains,

1702
01:35:08,121 --> 01:35:12,680
dude. Yeah, I guess. But once the
battle actually starts a bunch of,

1703
01:35:12,770 --> 01:35:14,090
when you hear them trumpet,

1704
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:18,860
like we were pretty close to one when it
led out like maybe within like 15 yards

1705
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:20,023
and it just went

1706
01:35:23,530 --> 01:35:27,890
whoa. Serious animal. Real
life. That is so loud.

1707
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:32,810
They're majestic, they have
such a presence. It was
raining out constantly there,

1708
01:35:32,811 --> 01:35:34,220
you know,
during the rainy season.

1709
01:35:34,221 --> 01:35:37,910
So this elephant was moving through
this unbelievably beautiful,

1710
01:35:37,911 --> 01:35:42,770
lush green landscape with like
fog and mist is fucking beautiful.

1711
01:35:42,860 --> 01:35:47,240
Huge tusks. And He lets out that
trumpet and you're like, whoa,

1712
01:35:47,241 --> 01:35:50,390
that's crazy animal man.
It's got to serious presence.

1713
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:53,780
Being around a funny students just walk
right up to him, pat it and touch it.

1714
01:35:53,810 --> 01:35:57,440
Like they were really well cared for it.
But we went to a tiger.

1715
01:35:57,441 --> 01:36:00,320
San was just gonna say, do
you do the tiger though? To
the opposite of the Tigers.

1716
01:36:00,330 --> 01:36:03,840
That was not, I didn't like that at all.
They were drugged up or they had a knife

1717
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:10,540
that was disturbed. Hey
gotta be man war. Well,

1718
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,160
the guy's got a can on top of it.

1719
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:15,740
He's going to another dog
and elephant and a fuck.

1720
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:21,990
That's dude as a canon. A cannon. That's
a legit cannon as a civil war can.

1721
01:36:21,991 --> 01:36:25,070
And on the top of these got a machine
gun. Look it. He's got a 50 cal.

1722
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:26,450
And what year is this?

1723
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:31,530
This is a picture that shows
up with that yellow phones.

1724
01:36:31,910 --> 01:36:36,560
Wow. Dude. Fucking
elephants, man. Oh 50 cal.

1725
01:36:36,561 --> 01:36:41,450
Look at this thing. See? Wow. Look
at all the guns, guns and spears.

1726
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:42,350
Who did all the shit.

1727
01:36:42,350 --> 01:36:47,350
And that's what I was talking about is
the shittiest way to see an army coming

1728
01:36:48,111 --> 01:36:52,420
towards you. Riding
elephants. That's like brave.

1729
01:36:52,421 --> 01:36:56,300
I like do not retreat.
Hold your ground. Fuck you.

1730
01:36:56,360 --> 01:36:59,320
There's such a peaceful
animals too. Yeah, it's such a,

1731
01:36:59,630 --> 01:37:03,080
they eat so much to,
you can't believe how much they eat.

1732
01:37:03,930 --> 01:37:05,300
Do they walk around in the streets?

1733
01:37:05,301 --> 01:37:08,810
A patio like a handle of we'll walk up
and down like the city streets just for

1734
01:37:08,811 --> 01:37:11,800
like, then they give you like fruit to
feed them like Papaya. They're like, hey,

1735
01:37:11,801 --> 01:37:13,630
you want to eat the elephant?
You like tip the guy and they're like,

1736
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:17,210
you see like an elephant? Like walking
down the street through traffic and potty.

1737
01:37:17,211 --> 01:37:19,400
It's fucking weird.
Huh? That's cool though.

1738
01:37:19,550 --> 01:37:22,900
But every now and then you see
them just get pissed. Yeah.

1739
01:37:22,901 --> 01:37:24,860
Do you ever see like the
elephants gone wild videos?

1740
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:30,390
They start tipping over cars
like the cardboard. I've seen the

1741
01:37:32,630 --> 01:37:36,080
stampede and the stopping
their trainers all pissed off.

1742
01:37:36,170 --> 01:37:40,280
Apparently they have a tigers
or wild in Thailand as well.

1743
01:37:40,281 --> 01:37:44,870
They really do have tigers.
You know the tiger is another,

1744
01:37:45,110 --> 01:37:46,080
another one of the time.

1745
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:50,990
Do you think that it's maybe something
in their diet that protects them from

1746
01:37:50,991 --> 01:37:54,550
staff and from ringworm and all that
jazz in terms of the fighters? Yeah.

1747
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:56,070
Perhaps

1748
01:37:56,070 --> 01:38:00,120
because they eat such spicy food is that
was wondering be related because they,

1749
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:01,680
when I tell you to Thai spice,

1750
01:38:01,681 --> 01:38:04,650
like some of the kids from the camp
would literally be like dripping sweat,

1751
01:38:04,651 --> 01:38:05,640
like eating the spicy.

1752
01:38:05,850 --> 01:38:09,330
I like sweating like dripping
profusely like sweat and eaten food.

1753
01:38:09,590 --> 01:38:14,090
I was when I was like spicy food
and I told him to go hard. Yeah.

1754
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:15,870
I said do it like you would do it.
Yeah.

1755
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:20,340
How you like fucking juice it
up baby. Yeah, and they didn't,

1756
01:38:20,370 --> 01:38:23,100
they fucking, they, they still remember,

1757
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:25,110
I remember one of the first
trip we had a Thailand.

1758
01:38:25,111 --> 01:38:28,610
I was with one of my buddies
then there were no Vietnam. We,

1759
01:38:28,780 --> 01:38:31,860
he ordered some dish and the ties
lake. No, that's, that's hot and spicy.

1760
01:38:31,861 --> 01:38:34,170
And he's like, no, that's all good.
Like, like, no, no, no, no, no.

1761
01:38:34,171 --> 01:38:37,440
That's really spicy lake. He's like, Nah,
no, it's good. I like speech, spicy food.

1762
01:38:37,441 --> 01:38:41,760
I'll just drink a lot of water, whatever.
He goes, AH, Ethan hot for Thai people.

1763
01:38:42,090 --> 01:38:44,970
And I was like, Bro, are you
listening to what he's saying?

1764
01:38:44,980 --> 01:38:48,870
They live in hot button, but he didn't
know any better and he went for it.

1765
01:38:48,871 --> 01:38:52,170
And I'm telling you bro, there was
three of us in a hotel room in Pattaya,

1766
01:38:52,171 --> 01:38:55,200
Thailand and I woke up in the middle of
night with to him fucking shooting ass,

1767
01:38:55,201 --> 01:38:59,490
piss ass soak the mattress,
the bed, the sheets.

1768
01:38:59,491 --> 01:39:01,800
He's found him in a ball
on the bathroom floor.

1769
01:39:01,801 --> 01:39:05,390
Do we have to take this kid to the
nearest hospital that he couldn't eat?

1770
01:39:05,391 --> 01:39:07,440
We had a ride them on the bike.
We had to ride three people.

1771
01:39:07,441 --> 01:39:11,250
One driving the kid in the middle and
me behind holding them up because he was

1772
01:39:11,251 --> 01:39:13,560
like out of it from spicy foods.
Dude,

1773
01:39:13,561 --> 01:39:17,940
he got so like she wasn't food
poisoning. No, no. It was just a spice.

1774
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,830
Just kicked his ass so bad.

1775
01:39:19,831 --> 01:39:22,030
He probably burnt a hole like
an ulcer in his stomach. Dude,

1776
01:39:22,031 --> 01:39:24,020
he was in the hospital for
like three days on an ivy.

1777
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:28,200
Got a bill for like fucking nine
bucks and we wrote that was a rap.

1778
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:31,740
But he never eat the fucking same
dish again though. Spices. Yeah.

1779
01:39:31,741 --> 01:39:34,320
I don't fuck with this place is too much.
I love Thai food and I'll like,

1780
01:39:34,321 --> 01:39:36,150
I'll experiment with it,
but I'm not like,

1781
01:39:36,390 --> 01:39:39,630
if my mouth is so hot and I can't taste
the food, I don't enjoy it. I'm just like,

1782
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:41,220
this is too much.
It seem right to me.

1783
01:39:41,221 --> 01:39:44,610
That seems like it would be more of a
food poisoning issue. It could have been,

1784
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:49,340
but all I know is that I'll never forget
the smell of that hotel room that was

1785
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:53,950
proven. You know, it's bad when
it soaks through the mattress. Oh,

1786
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:56,490
the Thais do they fucking
flip it over next?

1787
01:39:58,170 --> 01:39:59,580
I remember my buddy rented a house,

1788
01:39:59,581 --> 01:40:02,970
like a little like village
house behind the camp and um,

1789
01:40:03,270 --> 01:40:06,330
this Australian guy was like, Hey,
you mates fucking pretty scrappier.

1790
01:40:06,690 --> 01:40:08,880
And I was like, what do you mean?
He's like, I'm hey lips rough man.

1791
01:40:08,881 --> 01:40:11,650
I know you like to do to tie
thing and you know, but you know,

1792
01:40:11,700 --> 01:40:14,340
he's got fucking money. You don't have
to live like a fucking bum, you know?

1793
01:40:14,730 --> 01:40:17,020
And I was like, all right, why?
What's up man? He's like, man,

1794
01:40:17,021 --> 01:40:18,300
the fucking house he's living in.
Man,

1795
01:40:18,301 --> 01:40:21,690
a fucking woman died of a fucking
snake bite, died in her fucking bed,

1796
01:40:21,691 --> 01:40:25,440
got bit by a snake and wait,
what? So I told my buddy, bro,

1797
01:40:25,441 --> 01:40:28,590
he flipped the mattress over.
It was fucking soak in blood.

1798
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:32,280
They flip the mattress and they
fucking rent it to the next barn.

1799
01:40:32,310 --> 01:40:36,730
I like coming in
and I remember like literally like,

1800
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:40,380
like literally like going to
visit him and like, you know, put,

1801
01:40:40,381 --> 01:40:41,191
taking your shoes off,

1802
01:40:41,191 --> 01:40:45,660
going in his little fucking one room hut
and then going to put my shoes on back

1803
01:40:45,661 --> 01:40:47,490
and he's like, shaky sneakers,
shake them out. I'm like, well,

1804
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:50,760
I shake a fucking tarantula. Automate
sneakers. You got to shake you sneakers,

1805
01:40:51,230 --> 01:40:54,220
you got to shake your sneakers before
you go around. And in the morning.

1806
01:40:54,221 --> 01:40:57,240
That was one of the first things
I learned in Thailand. Dude,

1807
01:40:57,241 --> 01:40:59,740
at the first time I went to town, like
I was jumping on the ties, you know,

1808
01:40:59,741 --> 01:41:01,420
I didn't know if you're familiar with,
they have like a truck tire.

1809
01:41:01,421 --> 01:41:04,610
They lay down and they bounce on them. So
it's, yeah, it's great. What's that for?

1810
01:41:04,700 --> 01:41:07,780
It's literally like jumping rope cask
strength. It's like jumping rope,

1811
01:41:07,781 --> 01:41:10,090
but it's awesome because it's
not pounding on your joints.

1812
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:13,750
So you get the bounce of the tire and
they just kind of alternate stance and you

1813
01:41:13,751 --> 01:41:15,740
bounce on the tire and it's like,
you know your warm up,

1814
01:41:15,741 --> 01:41:16,574
it's part of your warm up.

1815
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:20,230
So I'm bouncing on the tires and there's
Jack Thai guy and it comes walking out

1816
01:41:20,231 --> 01:41:23,380
of the room and he grabbed a pair of
gloves and they usually put the laces over

1817
01:41:23,381 --> 01:41:25,750
the ropes. They hang the gloves
to dry over the ropes and he,

1818
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:29,110
he's like mean as fuck, look. And he puts
his hand in the glove, he goes, put it,

1819
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:33,550
he goes and he pulls his hand out in
a fucking tarantula, hit the ground.

1820
01:41:33,580 --> 01:41:36,920
Literally you could hear the weight
of the spider, like your link.

1821
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,530
I heard it hit the cement,

1822
01:41:38,531 --> 01:41:43,350
like the weight of the spider in this
fucking thing moved so fast about,

1823
01:41:43,420 --> 01:41:45,100
covered about 12 feet in,

1824
01:41:45,101 --> 01:41:48,970
jumped up four feet into a heavy bag
and crawled in between the crack of the

1825
01:41:48,971 --> 01:41:53,590
leather of the heavy bag. And I was like,
what the fuck was that? My buddy goes,

1826
01:41:53,890 --> 01:41:57,660
oh, that's a, that's a a Birdie and
spider. And I was like, a bird eating.

1827
01:41:57,730 --> 01:42:01,390
Why do they call it up? Wait a minute,
it can fucking catch birds. I was like,

1828
01:42:01,391 --> 01:42:02,890
what the fuck is this?
Like?

1829
01:42:03,130 --> 01:42:07,090
And then literally every time I put my
gloves on that I always like peek in them

1830
01:42:07,091 --> 01:42:09,670
and like tap on it.
Like walk away and like look at the glove,

1831
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:12,160
like kick the glove a little
bit. Like, all right ones good.

1832
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:15,910
Let's try the other one on
like every morning, just like
shaking Scorpions, audio,

1833
01:42:15,980 --> 01:42:18,110
Gotti, sneakers and stuff.
Pretty tricky. Something

1834
01:42:18,110 --> 01:42:21,920
crazy. We never had a rat problem
here at all and we had nothing.

1835
01:42:22,310 --> 01:42:26,060
And then my dog was here one day.
Uh,

1836
01:42:26,061 --> 01:42:28,710
I brought the dog by and um,

1837
01:42:28,940 --> 01:42:31,630
then all the sudden we started
having rat problem we had.

1838
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:37,000
And then Jamie looked it up and
rats are attracted to dossiers. Yes.

1839
01:42:37,001 --> 01:42:41,320
Yes. I thought that rats
eat it's dog shit. Yup.

1840
01:42:42,110 --> 01:42:43,760
I was just gonna say,
you gotta be the feces.

1841
01:42:43,761 --> 01:42:46,940
So we literally didn't have any
problem. And then Jamie was like, dude,

1842
01:42:46,941 --> 01:42:50,840
there's rat shit here. We found
ratchet and then, uh, Jeff,

1843
01:42:50,870 --> 01:42:55,100
the other guy works here, uh, found
a rat and killed it. Yeah. He,

1844
01:42:55,140 --> 01:42:59,210
he grabbed it by the tail. Ooh,
just smack that motherfucker.

1845
01:42:59,240 --> 01:43:03,290
How gangs does that?
Grabbed it by the tail tail,

1846
01:43:03,291 --> 01:43:06,470
poking out from behind a box
and he grabbed it and stopped it

1847
01:43:08,510 --> 01:43:13,400
because Marshall was running around here
that the rats smelled that the dog him

1848
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:14,450
in there and they got in there,

1849
01:43:14,650 --> 01:43:17,930
let do this crazy dog dog tracks
rats because they'd like to eat it.

1850
01:43:17,930 --> 01:43:19,500
Plain and simple. In fact, dog poo,

1851
01:43:19,501 --> 01:43:23,450
this had to be the number one food
source for rats and developed areas. Wow.

1852
01:43:24,410 --> 01:43:28,250
Marshall didn't even shit in here.
Just the smell.

1853
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:31,110
They might go to smell like smoke pissed.

1854
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:36,160
He pissed outside and he accidentally
pissed in my gym and he lifted his leg to

1855
01:43:36,231 --> 01:43:40,730
pee on the rug box, the, you
know, step up box. And I go, hey,

1856
01:43:40,731 --> 01:43:42,050
cut the shit.
We're inside.

1857
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:44,540
And then I took them outside
and then he finished his pissed.

1858
01:43:44,810 --> 01:43:49,610
So maybe the rat could smell the
rationale. That's fucked up though, man,

1859
01:43:49,630 --> 01:43:52,070
that was fucked up. I never
had a, I want to homework

1860
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:54,550
like those rat terriers,
they have dogs of that shit though.

1861
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:58,520
Wrapping a little rat terrier. I get
a few of those motherfuckers. Right.

1862
01:43:58,521 --> 01:44:02,840
Those little things. Things
never shut up. Yup, Yup, Yup.

1863
01:44:03,490 --> 01:44:06,860
They're go, go, go. My friend
Vicky Lewis from a news radio,

1864
01:44:06,861 --> 01:44:09,500
one of the actresses on news radio. She
had a Jack Russel. Yeah, there you go.

1865
01:44:09,830 --> 01:44:14,480
Great Dog. A big dog in a little
dog's body, like a huge attitude.

1866
01:44:14,481 --> 01:44:17,800
Like they step up to like big
mastiffs and fucking punk on the cool.

1867
01:44:17,810 --> 01:44:21,550
Then we'll do a little rat killers.
They're rat terriers, like the terrorist.

1868
01:44:21,551 --> 01:44:26,210
Did you ever see that documentary
on Netflix about rats? Horrific.

1869
01:44:26,211 --> 01:44:31,211
Really horrific in terms of infestation
gusting how many of them there are in

1870
01:44:31,731 --> 01:44:35,870
big cities. Like you realize like how,
what, what real issue is and my wife,

1871
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:40,190
my wife freaks the fuck out if she sees
a fucking rat. She's smart. She's smart.

1872
01:44:40,191 --> 01:44:41,390
Well,
we had like a little incident.

1873
01:44:41,391 --> 01:44:43,340
We will fucking pocket a parking
garage on the 4th of July.

1874
01:44:43,341 --> 01:44:46,610
We parked the car and walking down and
walk the to watch the fireworks and she's

1875
01:44:46,611 --> 01:44:50,310
standing there and she fucking felt
something on her foot and she looked at

1876
01:44:50,830 --> 01:44:53,240
giant fucking rat. She went on
her fucking nail Polish. She

1877
01:44:54,860 --> 01:44:58,730
freaked the fuck out. Never been the
same. You literally like Mike, my son,

1878
01:44:58,731 --> 01:45:01,070
Dante always fucks it up. He's like, mom,

1879
01:45:01,071 --> 01:45:02,990
look a rat and she's fucking freaks
the fuck out, right? She's like,

1880
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:05,450
that's not funny. Stop that
shit. And He, we all laugh at it.

1881
01:45:05,451 --> 01:45:08,360
It's fucking hilarious. Deathly
afraid of rats. Rats. A nasty dude.

1882
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:11,760
They're so gross. That's a nasty in
the documentary that you saw this dog.

1883
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:15,470
Don't they control something in terms
of population? They have like benefits.

1884
01:45:15,471 --> 01:45:19,090
They're good at keeping rat
populations high. That's about it.

1885
01:45:19,091 --> 01:45:22,650
What are they good for? The good for
cleaning up dog. Shit. That's nasty.

1886
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:26,000
Even imagine that's their number
one source of food. It's gross.

1887
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:29,840
What the fuck, man? He
must have horrible breath.

1888
01:45:33,050 --> 01:45:37,340
Creepy little survivor. Uh, but the,
the documentary on Netflix is brilliant.

1889
01:45:37,341 --> 01:45:40,370
It really got to check it out.
And one of one of the scenes,

1890
01:45:40,371 --> 01:45:44,330
they have these rat terriers tearing them
apart where they're digging into these

1891
01:45:44,331 --> 01:45:48,020
holes on the rats come out and the
dogs just grab them and mangle them.

1892
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:51,530
That's what they're followup. Do
you think they're like, I'm just,

1893
01:45:51,531 --> 01:45:53,780
I just read something quickly
and it doesn't really say much.

1894
01:45:53,781 --> 01:45:57,080
You think they just like to
eat trash and they help us? No,

1895
01:45:59,210 --> 01:46:02,960
don't do that. They control some
population. They, they're good.

1896
01:46:02,961 --> 01:46:06,200
They gotta be good for fucking something.
I know this is an ecosystem, right?

1897
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:11,000
Exactly. Every animal has its little
spot. Do we get the Big Boston rats?

1898
01:46:11,001 --> 01:46:13,490
They literally like,
they fucking punk cats.

1899
01:46:13,491 --> 01:46:16,280
They look like they're like the
size of like a possum. They like,

1900
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:19,760
there's survived bigger than like any
jacked up squirrel or anything like that.

1901
01:46:19,761 --> 01:46:21,110
They're just big,
big,

1902
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:26,210
the triangle tails like asti
after survivor cat rats,

1903
01:46:26,211 --> 01:46:30,460
rather their deer out in the cold winter
and then figure out a way to get the

1904
01:46:30,461 --> 01:46:31,430
fucking Boston rats.

1905
01:46:31,431 --> 01:46:35,690
I get accents and shit
like fucking scally cap

1906
01:46:38,030 --> 01:46:39,440
running around eating dog shit.

1907
01:46:40,010 --> 01:46:44,300
Do you ever think about Bailyn the
fucking winters there and everything?

1908
01:46:44,301 --> 01:46:48,290
Does it get to you all the
time? All the time. Yeah. I
mean, my parents are elderly,

1909
01:46:48,291 --> 01:46:50,070
like I got to keep an eye on them and all

1910
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:53,360
my family's in Boston and my
businesses in Boston. But you know,

1911
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:56,970
luckily I travel a lot, so it's kind of
like the, the vent, you know what I mean?

1912
01:46:56,971 --> 01:46:59,940
I get away and I'll fucking do like a
day or two on a beach somewhere at a UFC

1913
01:46:59,941 --> 01:47:03,870
event, like, and, and that'll
be like a little recharge.
But man, I'm, as I get older,

1914
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:06,300
I never really was like,
you know,

1915
01:47:06,301 --> 01:47:09,300
overwhelmed with winters until I started
getting older. And now I'm like, do it.

1916
01:47:09,301 --> 01:47:13,650
My body hurts, my muscles ached,
my joints ache, the cold's nasty.

1917
01:47:13,651 --> 01:47:17,910
Especially that New England cold man.
And it's like wet cold. It's so long.

1918
01:47:17,911 --> 01:47:20,220
You've got the fuck out. And I remember
we talked about this, you're like,

1919
01:47:20,221 --> 01:47:25,110
fuck winter, fuck snow. Like fuck
that. Well, here's the thing,

1920
01:47:25,111 --> 01:47:28,810
I like some places where it gets cold.
Like I love Colorado.

1921
01:47:28,820 --> 01:47:31,710
I remember you lived there for a little
bit. Yeah, I would move back there.

1922
01:47:32,510 --> 01:47:35,880
Jamie and I have talked about it.
That shit gets different cold though.

1923
01:47:35,881 --> 01:47:39,890
It's like the fine. Yeah, it's not as
bad as like the New England winters,

1924
01:47:39,891 --> 01:47:44,340
so it's like wet, nasty four wheel
drive, snow tires, warm clothes,

1925
01:47:44,370 --> 01:47:47,580
fireplace.
Archery's do it.

1926
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:52,260
It's just it Colorado. It's sunny.
That's the other thing. Good point.

1927
01:47:52,290 --> 01:47:55,670
Colorado's sunny like 300 plus
days a year. Boston. Yeah,

1928
01:47:56,730 --> 01:47:59,680
months with that crazy shit.
And this guy,

1929
01:48:00,150 --> 01:48:03,240
we don't see past the clouds now.
I never seen nothing.

1930
01:48:03,241 --> 01:48:06,120
Just just a dog gray blanket

1931
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:10,470
hanging over your head follows you around.
The women,

1932
01:48:10,471 --> 01:48:14,490
the attitude they have like
when are you going to do for me?

1933
01:48:16,060 --> 01:48:20,300
It was just the, you wonder why they're
like this. Fucking miserable. Yeah.

1934
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:22,020
But I'll tell you what though.
Boston in the summer,

1935
01:48:22,021 --> 01:48:25,260
I love Boston this summer that, oh, it's
amazing. When is like the sun's out,

1936
01:48:25,261 --> 01:48:29,110
guns out. Everybody's running around
girls addressing half dressed.

1937
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:31,890
Somebody looks happy. Exactly.
Like everybody's happy.

1938
01:48:31,891 --> 01:48:35,370
Everybody's chose Boston in the summer
was cool. I liked Boston and I'm, I'm a,

1939
01:48:35,371 --> 01:48:38,310
I'm a Boston native.
I always will be true and true,

1940
01:48:38,311 --> 01:48:41,550
but definitely not a fan of the
windows and I've got to bail someday.

1941
01:48:41,570 --> 01:48:46,290
I'll probably, yeah. Where are you going
to go? Come about question possibly.

1942
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:51,150
Mm hmm. You're looking
for work. You hiring?

1943
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:56,310
Listen, I was going to hire a
Moitai coach. Started up a gym.

1944
01:48:56,340 --> 01:49:01,080
I like it located a few times. They
could use one out here. Honestly.

1945
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:05,070
Yeah. There's not like a real dedicated
more time Jim anywhere near me. Yeah,

1946
01:49:05,310 --> 01:49:07,360
I got offers, you know,
obviously like working, you know,

1947
01:49:07,470 --> 01:49:11,010
for the company and whatnot, you know,
some offers to move to Vegas and whatnot.

1948
01:49:11,011 --> 01:49:13,560
And at first I was like, Fuck
Vegas, I'm never living in Vegas.

1949
01:49:13,860 --> 01:49:17,340
But then I started hanging around with
like the right people and like Henderson,

1950
01:49:17,430 --> 01:49:20,880
oh dude. Out of Summerlin, like,
like Lorenzo lives, like hanging out,

1951
01:49:20,881 --> 01:49:24,060
going to like football games at Lorenzo
and a fan. Like, dude, it's like families,

1952
01:49:24,610 --> 01:49:28,260
little kids riding bikes down the street.
It's like it's normal. It felt normal.

1953
01:49:28,261 --> 01:49:31,380
Like Summerlin, Summerlin and
Vegas felt normal to me. Like,

1954
01:49:31,381 --> 01:49:33,720
I felt like I could actually live
in Summerlin. Like, you know,

1955
01:49:34,130 --> 01:49:38,240
the thing about it is I need to be
near the ocean, all connected to the,

1956
01:49:38,270 --> 01:49:40,920
the Evil Dick of Vegas.
You know,

1957
01:49:41,070 --> 01:49:45,730
it's so like all the ges comes
out of the Dick and Amy hours,

1958
01:49:46,190 --> 01:49:50,950
full feed economies. Those
communities wouldn't be so true. No,

1959
01:49:50,951 --> 01:49:53,170
you're absolutely right. The casino.
You're absolutely right, man.

1960
01:49:53,230 --> 01:49:57,220
The worst is seeing like the locals like
get their check on Fridays and they go

1961
01:49:57,221 --> 01:50:00,810
right to the fucking casino and they
just blow through it. Fucking sad to see.

1962
01:50:00,830 --> 01:50:05,020
Man. Biggest is a fucking weird place too.
And I'm, I'm way over Vegas. People like,

1963
01:50:05,021 --> 01:50:07,510
Oh, you want to Vegas? It's fucking
awesome doing it had been, I'm like, dude,

1964
01:50:07,511 --> 01:50:11,320
it's not an awesome about fucking,
the good parts are really good.

1965
01:50:11,321 --> 01:50:13,010
Like the restaurants are really,
absolutely.

1966
01:50:13,510 --> 01:50:17,800
Vegas has some of the best restaurants.
They still have 24 hour pool hall.

1967
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:21,230
I was just gonna say, that's one thing
that I like about Vegas. It's not,

1968
01:50:21,250 --> 01:50:23,530
nothing's ever close.
You want to fucking Burger,

1969
01:50:23,531 --> 01:50:25,930
it's fucking four o'clock in the wind
and go fucking get a burger somewhere.

1970
01:50:25,931 --> 01:50:27,820
You want to go out, you want to
have a drink, you want to play pool.

1971
01:50:27,821 --> 01:50:30,700
Like we've done many a times like
late at night, middle of night.

1972
01:50:30,701 --> 01:50:32,550
That's what I love about it.
I'm a night owl for sure.

1973
01:50:32,551 --> 01:50:35,920
Like I don't sleep well
at night. Like if, if,

1974
01:50:35,970 --> 01:50:40,480
if I were to choose like
just to like operate the lake
from, from uh, the sunset,

1975
01:50:40,481 --> 01:50:43,180
like sundown to Sunup, like,
and then sleep all day.

1976
01:50:43,181 --> 01:50:46,270
Like I would like other than laying in
the sun, like I'm a night owl for sure.

1977
01:50:46,660 --> 01:50:49,340
But that's the one thing I do like
about Vegas. So I said nothing.

1978
01:50:49,470 --> 01:50:53,940
Nothing's difficult. Feel weird. Like
why can't I buy a drink at 3:00 AM? Yeah,

1979
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:57,850
exactly. Why do you, why? How come I can't
have a beer when I want to have a beer.

1980
01:50:58,110 --> 01:51:01,900
I had grown man. Yeah, exactly.
Everybody gets crazy. Yeah.

1981
01:51:04,540 --> 01:51:07,720
That's what's going up at the
time. Or like we tell you, look,

1982
01:51:07,721 --> 01:51:08,890
you've got to go to bed.
Yeah.

1983
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:12,360
As if it's going to like give us
structure and like teach us lessons,

1984
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:15,520
but I guess it's does, it does,
right? Like the gambling thing,

1985
01:51:15,740 --> 01:51:19,480
the thing about gambling as if gambling
was everywhere, then it would normalize.

1986
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:24,400
Right. But it's not everywhere. It's just
in a couple spots. So when you get to it,

1987
01:51:24,401 --> 01:51:26,800
that's when people are
like up playing cards.

1988
01:51:26,801 --> 01:51:31,130
If fucking morning bleary-eyed
Betten their mortgage. Yeah.

1989
01:51:31,450 --> 01:51:36,160
Pumping oxygen into the casino, show
many people go there and lose everything.

1990
01:51:36,820 --> 01:51:41,020
Everything they had. I can't even fathom
that. Like it happens all the time.

1991
01:51:41,021 --> 01:51:43,150
You see it? No, not really.
You know what I mean? I'll,

1992
01:51:43,151 --> 01:51:46,390
I'll entertain and play
like some blackjack or
something like that if like my

1993
01:51:46,391 --> 01:51:49,060
buddy's a plan, but I'm
not really, like, I don't,

1994
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:51,400
I don't go out of my way to gamble.
I like that.

1995
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:53,980
I was just gonna say the same thing.
I like bet and fights.

1996
01:51:53,981 --> 01:51:56,680
I like doing stuff like that. I just,
whatever, best with friends, whatever.

1997
01:51:56,681 --> 01:52:00,070
But then fights just makes
it more interest. Absolutely.
Yeah. Like, you know,

1998
01:52:00,071 --> 01:52:04,420
like yeah, give me a 50 bucks on this.
And then while you're watching it,

1999
01:52:04,421 --> 01:52:08,400
you're like, come on. Exactly.
Yes. And then you agree,

2000
01:52:08,401 --> 01:52:11,170
you always feel real sneaky when
you get a shit decision. Your like,

2001
01:52:11,730 --> 01:52:15,610
we won that one. You deserve it.
You know, my buddy, one of my, uh,

2002
01:52:15,670 --> 01:52:17,620
one of the guys I train Rico to shoe low,

2003
01:52:17,621 --> 01:52:22,480
he bets fights and he is fucking spot on
man. He doesn't miss. He said, I'll do it.

2004
01:52:22,481 --> 01:52:25,120
He can. I literally, I can sell
it in between cause I, you know,

2005
01:52:25,121 --> 01:52:26,830
Marion and the truck, I'm
always bet. And what Marin,

2006
01:52:26,831 --> 01:52:29,680
we're always just like betting
on fights and uh, I just,

2007
01:52:29,681 --> 01:52:32,290
I go right to my buddy Rico. I'm
like, Rico, he got well you're like,

2008
01:52:32,291 --> 01:52:34,380
did you consult on about this weekend?
Ah,

2009
01:52:34,390 --> 01:52:39,040
yes and he was spot on with every
flight except for one, I think. Uh, uh,

2010
01:52:39,180 --> 01:52:43,420
Nicola Mateo, Sa Niccolo, who,
uh, got caught by a Dustin Ortiz,

2011
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:46,010
I think that was the only fight he missed.
That was crazy head

2012
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:49,100
kick. It was man. And he
set it up nice to you.

2013
01:52:49,101 --> 01:52:52,130
Set it up real nice because you know, he,
it almost looked, it was like delayed.

2014
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:55,580
It's like, it's almost like one speed and
then it, and then it changed direction.

2015
01:52:55,581 --> 01:52:58,470
It changed us speed and he went high with
it. He set it up good and it was done.

2016
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:02,900
Not a question mark kick
but like to the middle,

2017
01:53:02,901 --> 01:53:04,100
bring that and then you went up high.

2018
01:53:04,340 --> 01:53:07,880
Take a peek at that because it's like
he was establishing like a low kick at

2019
01:53:07,881 --> 01:53:11,660
first and then it's almost like he went
to look like it was going to throw a

2020
01:53:11,661 --> 01:53:14,540
head, a low kick, and then he
changed the speed of the kick.

2021
01:53:14,541 --> 01:53:16,010
I called them the like the delay.

2022
01:53:16,011 --> 01:53:19,340
If you delay the kick and you change
the timing of the, of the kick,

2023
01:53:19,341 --> 01:53:21,080
it's hard to read.
That's how we caught them.

2024
01:53:21,350 --> 01:53:24,140
You actually had a glove up
to oddly enough, but it went
right through the glove.

2025
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:28,090
You know, it was a, doesn't look good
though, man. You look good. Yeah, yeah.

2026
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:30,380
He's a stud, you know? Yeah. He really is.

2027
01:53:30,590 --> 01:53:32,760
Well they need people at
that weight class. You know,

2028
01:53:32,780 --> 01:53:37,280
who the fuck is there this
weekend? Yeah. Who's, who's there,

2029
01:53:37,790 --> 01:53:42,590
you know, good question. I mean, unless
TJ comes down or Cody comes down,

2030
01:53:42,591 --> 01:53:44,840
depending upon who wins this fight.
Yeah.

2031
01:53:44,930 --> 01:53:47,480
Apparently they can both make the
weight and that's another thing too,

2032
01:53:47,481 --> 01:53:49,130
wasn't Demetrius concern with that?

2033
01:53:49,131 --> 01:53:52,220
He's going to commit to having a fight
with one of them and then go through a

2034
01:53:52,221 --> 01:53:55,220
full camp and then they miss wait
and then fuck. So he said like, yes,

2035
01:53:55,250 --> 01:53:59,450
take a fight. Yeah, I agree with
that a hundred percent yeah, I do,

2036
01:53:59,451 --> 01:54:03,770
but I don't think they would miss weight.
Those guys are super professional.

2037
01:54:03,771 --> 01:54:08,600
Both of them are and and TJ dirty already
said he'd made the wait before. Wow.

2038
01:54:08,820 --> 01:54:11,030
He's tried it. Yeah. Yeah.
He's got an interesting,

2039
01:54:11,330 --> 01:54:14,230
well he seems smaller than he used
just going to say. Yeah, he's,

2040
01:54:14,231 --> 01:54:17,960
he's definitely a lot leaner than he
used to be. You know? Is this it here?

2041
01:54:19,010 --> 01:54:20,870
What part of the fight you want me
to get to? Dante's little thing.

2042
01:54:20,900 --> 01:54:24,610
Just a knockout itself to finish the
Dustin Ortiz finish against them.

2043
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:28,250
Mateus Niccolo was it? This
is a chick fight, dude.

2044
01:54:29,060 --> 01:54:32,060
You don't know what you're doing.
Crazy son of a bitch.

2045
01:54:34,820 --> 01:54:37,490
That kid a Mateus though.
Niccolo. He trained,

2046
01:54:37,491 --> 01:54:40,790
he came through the gym through a
couple of my Brazilian students,

2047
01:54:40,810 --> 01:54:45,800
a Sabal and Rodrigo and here it is.
He a, this kid's tough man. So Dustin,

2048
01:54:45,860 --> 01:54:50,120
those impressive when you know,
yeah, I mean there are literally are,

2049
01:54:50,150 --> 01:54:53,630
see how it kind of delayed.
Do you see that kind of back again?

2050
01:54:53,750 --> 01:54:55,310
He changes speed in the kick.

2051
01:54:55,311 --> 01:54:57,860
I noticed that in the replay when we were
calling them. I was like, look at this.

2052
01:54:57,861 --> 01:55:02,080
How he does it. Let's see here.
Yeah, that's right. A lot.

2053
01:55:02,090 --> 01:55:05,640
She's watched the speed change.
You see in the beginning.

2054
01:55:05,670 --> 01:55:07,280
That's what made it difficult to read.

2055
01:55:07,281 --> 01:55:09,380
It's kind of like came up at
a weird angle. Yeah, it did.

2056
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:14,600
It came up like at a 45 degree
angle. Yeah. He won't let go. Nope.

2057
01:55:16,010 --> 01:55:20,360
Did he bonus for this fight? I don't
know. I forget who I do not like bonuses.

2058
01:55:20,390 --> 01:55:23,090
I do not like when bonuses
that don't like them.

2059
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:27,560
I don't think cause I don't think you
should be paid more to when everyone's

2060
01:55:27,561 --> 01:55:28,394
trying to win.

2061
01:55:28,940 --> 01:55:32,960
I don't think you should lose because
of fucking judge who has no idea what

2062
01:55:32,961 --> 01:55:35,590
they're talking about. Look, he be
blocked that fairly decent. Yeah,

2063
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:39,170
he had the glove up and still got chaos
right through. It just got rocked.

2064
01:55:39,620 --> 01:55:44,520
I don't, I don't think, especially
since they haven't dealt well at all

2065
01:55:44,700 --> 01:55:46,260
with the judging issue.

2066
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:50,040
I mean they really have done a terrible
job with judging these state commissions.

2067
01:55:50,041 --> 01:55:53,850
Yeah, there's so much bad judging.
So if you have three people at the,

2068
01:55:53,860 --> 01:55:56,880
I think the system sucks.
I think the judging system itself,

2069
01:55:56,881 --> 01:56:00,240
the 10 point must system is outdated.
It's not right for MMA.

2070
01:56:00,241 --> 01:56:02,400
It's great for boxing.
It's not good for MMA.

2071
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:06,030
I think it needs to be revamped and
restructured and I think it should be a

2072
01:56:06,031 --> 01:56:08,640
completely different system.
And then I think on top of that,

2073
01:56:08,641 --> 01:56:09,820
the judges are in competent.

2074
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:14,310
There's so much in competence
is what those factors.

2075
01:56:14,311 --> 01:56:16,470
And then you have wind bonuses.

2076
01:56:16,830 --> 01:56:21,240
So you have bad decisions all the time
and normal with these bad decisions,

2077
01:56:21,241 --> 01:56:24,780
you give a wind bonus to the wrong person
and the wrong person gets fucked over.

2078
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:30,000
You know? And the, the swing is half the
pay and that the level of the pay scale,

2079
01:56:30,001 --> 01:56:32,610
it's just like they're already
making fucking peanuts. Yeah.

2080
01:56:32,611 --> 01:56:34,860
And if you're not making peanuts,
it costs you more.

2081
01:56:34,890 --> 01:56:37,830
Could cost you a hundred grand
cost even more than that.

2082
01:56:38,460 --> 01:56:42,510
If you make one 51 50 and then you
should have won a fight and you lost,

2083
01:56:42,511 --> 01:56:45,920
you lost $150,000 because it was three
people are in competence. Exactly.

2084
01:56:45,990 --> 01:56:49,170
Cause they did a fucking eight hour
course on a Saturday. Never fucking put,

2085
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:52,800
they don't care. This is the thing.
They're not, they're not fans.

2086
01:56:53,130 --> 01:56:56,490
They just do that because that's their
job. It's a cool job. Yeah. It's,

2087
01:56:56,540 --> 01:56:58,770
tell the boys it's cool job.
There are some judges that,

2088
01:56:58,771 --> 01:57:01,560
that do know what they're doing. So then
I, this is a small handful. There is,

2089
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:06,420
there is, yeah. And they have to, they
have to helicopter the men. Pretty much.

2090
01:57:06,450 --> 01:57:10,500
It's a crazy system.
The system of badly needs to be updated.

2091
01:57:10,530 --> 01:57:14,300
I don't understand why they haven't, it
just doesn't make any sense to me. Um,

2092
01:57:14,310 --> 01:57:17,280
what you owe me,
but I don't like the wind bonus thing bad.

2093
01:57:17,340 --> 01:57:19,560
I just think you should get paid.
You should,

2094
01:57:19,561 --> 01:57:23,250
it should be a flat rate like it
is in boxing. You know, it just,

2095
01:57:23,251 --> 01:57:26,760
I don't think it incentivizes people
to fight harder. I don't believe that.

2096
01:57:26,761 --> 01:57:31,350
I think the winners are always going to
try to win. You know, I don't and I think,

2097
01:57:31,650 --> 01:57:35,580
and it's like I said about fighting,
like don't, don't fight technical.

2098
01:57:35,581 --> 01:57:39,510
You go out there and you let
it all hang out. Don't do that.

2099
01:57:39,890 --> 01:57:42,490
Do you get to have a nice short
career if you do that? True.

2100
01:57:42,680 --> 01:57:45,990
And that's what happens to those guys.
It's good for the business.

2101
01:57:45,991 --> 01:57:50,550
It's good for the company. It's good for
the, the, the, that night, the views,

2102
01:57:50,700 --> 01:57:53,520
the boy, the people are watching. It
will be little bit more entertaining,

2103
01:57:53,730 --> 01:57:55,770
but you're not going to make it.
You're going to,

2104
01:57:55,771 --> 01:57:58,710
you're going to leave half
your brain in that octagon.

2105
01:57:58,711 --> 01:58:01,010
It's another thing to have.
And we talk about that all the time too,

2106
01:58:01,011 --> 01:58:03,900
is that seeing that these guys
take trauma the way they do, man,

2107
01:58:04,590 --> 01:58:08,550
Todd to watch man, as much as we've, we've
spoke about this briefly in the past,

2108
01:58:08,551 --> 01:58:09,384
but uh,
you know,

2109
01:58:09,390 --> 01:58:14,190
as much as a fan as I am and as
involved as I am in the sport, man,

2110
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:18,120
it's hard to watch sometimes fancy.
And these guys take the damage they do.

2111
01:58:18,180 --> 01:58:20,370
You know, I remember like I told you,
I think I told you the story before,

2112
01:58:20,371 --> 01:58:23,640
Marcus Davis, after his fight, coincident
laying off, I believe with Chris Lidell,

2113
01:58:23,970 --> 01:58:28,170
he lost his sense of smell for
like seven months. He couldn't,

2114
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:30,810
he couldn't smell them. And I
told you about this, but you know,

2115
01:58:30,811 --> 01:58:34,140
he couldn't smell like anything, which
means you can't taste. So like he would,

2116
01:58:34,530 --> 01:58:36,990
he'd be like, Bro, I smell like shit. And
like people would have to tell me like,

2117
01:58:36,991 --> 01:58:39,660
Bro, you fucking stank. And then it'd be
like, I put on too much call and be like,

2118
01:58:39,661 --> 01:58:42,100
Bro, easy on the Cologne.
Like he had no clue. Like,

2119
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:44,920
you know, he couldn't taste like
lemonade. Tastes like fucking fruit punch.

2120
01:58:44,921 --> 01:58:45,760
He had no fucking clue.

2121
01:58:45,761 --> 01:58:50,020
He had no sense of smell
or taste for seven months.

2122
01:58:50,110 --> 01:58:52,990
Imagine that he's, it came back,
he had lit thank God it did. Yeah,

2123
01:58:52,991 --> 01:58:55,270
but he even said, I was like, what'd
you, what'd you miss the most like,

2124
01:58:55,271 --> 01:58:58,300
and he's like the smell of my
daughter's hair. And I was like, Whoa,

2125
01:58:59,260 --> 01:59:03,640
that's fucking trippy dude. And he
counts check please. Like I'm all set.

2126
01:59:03,690 --> 01:59:06,540
And he kept fighting it too.
And that was, that was on,

2127
01:59:06,580 --> 01:59:09,250
I don't want to say early in his career,
but maybe halfway through.

2128
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:14,080
Well he again came from that school
of hard knocks and Boston Charlie bar.

2129
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:15,970
Exactly. Yup. Hard sparring.

2130
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:20,650
Hard training and does what I was saying
about Jeremy Stevens earlier two to

2131
01:59:20,651 --> 01:59:23,920
bring it all back around.
Jeremy spars hard. You know,

2132
01:59:23,921 --> 01:59:27,050
I was talking to Jocko about it. It's
like, you know, Jeremy's and animal.

2133
01:59:27,400 --> 01:59:30,760
I remember, I remember discussing that
with Lorenzo back in the day as a,

2134
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:34,270
he went to Brazil when they were
doing the Aldo pieces and whatnot,

2135
01:59:34,271 --> 01:59:35,860
and he went to Nova
and down. He said, man,

2136
01:59:35,861 --> 01:59:39,790
these fucking guys kill each
other in the gym. He's like this.

2137
01:59:39,910 --> 01:59:44,620
It's like literally like there are 100%
head hunting trying to kill each other.

2138
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:48,340
I don't agree with that at
all. Obviously. It's horrible.

2139
01:59:48,780 --> 01:59:53,290
And there's so many guys that get really
badly rocked on their way to fights.

2140
01:59:53,291 --> 01:59:57,760
Yeah. Oh yeah. All the time.
It's like sometimes like if a,

2141
01:59:57,790 --> 02:00:02,080
if a guy takes a big punch, like, and
he gets a flash k o like in, in uh,

2142
02:00:02,130 --> 02:00:04,900
in the gym. Like if we got to pull
them from a fight because of that,

2143
02:00:04,901 --> 02:00:09,340
because he's affected at that point.
It's like still this residual, like the,

2144
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:12,490
you know, mean it's still
lingering. No way around it.
No way around it, man. Yeah.

2145
02:00:12,550 --> 02:00:17,340
I even had like a, a student in
mind. My Guy, Tommy ended up, ah,

2146
02:00:17,410 --> 02:00:19,510
he had gotten a car
accident, you know, like a,

2147
02:00:19,511 --> 02:00:23,290
a week before his fight and this
kid's got a granite Chin and he got,

2148
02:00:23,320 --> 02:00:26,530
he got caught like, and we attributed
to the impact of the car crash.

2149
02:00:26,531 --> 02:00:27,101
Like we said,

2150
02:00:27,101 --> 02:00:29,950
it had to have been like you suffered
some head trauma cause he hit his head in

2151
02:00:29,951 --> 02:00:32,260
the car crash and he was susceptible.

2152
02:00:32,261 --> 02:00:35,080
He was vulnerable to the Kol
because of the trauma that he took.

2153
02:00:35,081 --> 02:00:38,560
So you're taking big punches in the gym
like that and then you go on on fight

2154
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:41,890
night, it's that much easier for you
to get likes out, you know the percent.

2155
02:00:41,891 --> 02:00:46,891
But it's so hard to make a tough elite
fighter without subjecting them to

2156
02:00:47,470 --> 02:00:50,630
exactly what you see. Like Robbie
Lawler, like, like he's talked about,

2157
02:00:50,650 --> 02:00:51,660
he doesn't inspire anymore.
Like,

2158
02:00:51,700 --> 02:00:55,320
well he didn't for a long did it
take when you went to att? Okay.

2159
02:00:55,520 --> 02:01:00,130
But for a long time he didn't like all
through his strike force Craig Ryan's bar,

2160
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:04,900
which seems crazy. Like I already know
how to fight. I'm not going to argue.

2161
02:01:04,980 --> 02:01:09,510
It was going to say that boy can't fight.
You can't fucking flight deck.

2162
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:11,620
I know he's had a lot of fun,
a lot of tough fights.

2163
02:01:11,650 --> 02:01:14,500
That's why I was so impressive
with Rafael dos Anjos did to him.

2164
02:01:14,980 --> 02:01:18,010
It's like dos Anjos just sort of
dismantled. I didn't see that coming.

2165
02:01:18,160 --> 02:01:22,270
And then Colby Covington and
Mandel dos Anjos so I was like,

2166
02:01:22,271 --> 02:01:23,740
what in the hell?

2167
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:28,800
He took them apart to gas
tank for today's list.

2168
02:01:29,050 --> 02:01:33,430
Fucking pressure. I got the hired watching
the fight. I was gas in the truck.

2169
02:01:33,431 --> 02:01:36,970
Like meanwhile Dosantos
known for his cardio.

2170
02:01:36,970 --> 02:01:41,720
He's wanting Nickerson's pupils. So
he's like, you know, trains in that mob.

2171
02:01:41,721 --> 02:01:45,860
Marinovich honestly like around
the second round, I was like,

2172
02:01:45,890 --> 02:01:47,780
there's no way he can keep this pace up.

2173
02:01:47,781 --> 02:01:50,800
He's got a fade and he never
fucking hate it. He never faded.

2174
02:01:51,020 --> 02:01:55,200
Do you see him hand the, the Bolt Josh
Rob, I was looking at it on the way here.

2175
02:01:55,540 --> 02:01:58,320
I was looking at it. I was like, this
is crazy. It said something like an MTV.

2176
02:01:58,330 --> 02:02:01,520
Jackie Lake he comes through
with is as, as uh, as stated.

2177
02:02:01,521 --> 02:02:06,080
He comes through with us was going to
bring the belt to white out fucking Donald

2178
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:09,300
Trump.
What a strapple so funny man.

2179
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:13,970
Maggot hat on the red hat on.
Dude.

2180
02:02:13,971 --> 02:02:17,010
He's fucking sold it man.
He has miss.

2181
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:20,540
You got to remember early and
Colbys career. He wasn't like that.

2182
02:02:21,080 --> 02:02:23,480
He wasn't like that. He just figured
it out. Where'd he come from?

2183
02:02:23,780 --> 02:02:26,810
I know he's had 18 again, but wait,
where was he trying to before? Att?

2184
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:28,130
That's a good question.

2185
02:02:28,160 --> 02:02:32,210
I do not know cause he kinda loud when
I say came out of nowhere like he earned

2186
02:02:32,211 --> 02:02:36,860
his way in but he really liked
it was like, oh I love it.

2187
02:02:37,700 --> 02:02:41,780
It's so funny that a red hat with
white letters can get you punched now.

2188
02:02:41,930 --> 02:02:45,410
I mean they could say anything.
What? This girl had a hat on,

2189
02:02:45,411 --> 02:02:48,960
it said make bitcoin great again and
they fucking, they, what's that spray?

2190
02:02:49,550 --> 02:02:51,470
What's the make America great again.
Yeah,

2191
02:02:52,170 --> 02:02:57,110
but on the red hat with white letters
is racist now be a Nazi flag to some

2192
02:02:57,111 --> 02:03:01,660
people. But this, this gun so
crazy. It is crazy right now.

2193
02:03:02,150 --> 02:03:05,930
Topsy Turvy world we're living in
and flags and shit. Ridiculous. Well,

I believe so. Three o'clock
in the Orpheum. Yeah.

2197
02:03:12,381 --> 02:03:17,210
And it's probably a three hour drive to
take karate. Sit. Y'All Tang in Boston.

2198
02:03:17,211 --> 02:03:20,570
