1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,750
Her low freak bitches most of
the time it's bad technique.

2
00:00:04,751 --> 00:00:08,230
Most of the times with the lead lag
and they don't step open to right foot,

3
00:00:08,231 --> 00:00:12,330
so the angle cannot go like a 90 degree
angle into the muscle and it kick

4
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:13,100
straight up.

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:13,360
It'd be,

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:13,601
she goes,

7
00:00:13,601 --> 00:00:13,840
look,

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,051
look,

9
00:00:14,051 --> 00:00:15,400
I've everybody who gets
kicked to the pills,

10
00:00:15,401 --> 00:00:19,150
I guarantee you the leg that they're
standing on the toes are pointing forward.

11
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,560
If they will pointed the site,

12
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,370
it will be okay.

13
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,210
Well with check,

14
00:00:22,211 --> 00:00:24,190
I believe it was knees and the clinch.

15
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:25,450
Oh it was,

16
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:26,480
I think it was just

17
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,620
a tight box or shooting on it.

18
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,980
I never need anybody and bill,

19
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:31,960
I did once actually,

20
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:33,130
but that was on purpose.

21
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,980
I guess they rose.

22
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,610
I if I could fight video from that,

23
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,110
that is the best deal.

24
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,320
So I fight where they,

25
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:42,641
Rosie,

26
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:43,480
you heard about that right?

27
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,340
The taller guy from whole,

28
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:47,480
a total psychopath they say and
it does always illegal thing.

29
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:49,120
So we're fighting him
and I'm the first ride.

30
00:00:49,121 --> 00:00:51,910
I beat the crap out of him in a second
ride would come out and be a clinching

31
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,490
and he bites in my ear and I'm shouting,

32
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,270
let go,

33
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,103
let go,

34
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:56,801
let go.

35
00:00:56,801 --> 00:01:00,610
And then you see my knee going all the
way back and then I need him as he comes

36
00:01:00,611 --> 00:01:01,421
loose from the ground.

37
00:01:01,421 --> 00:01:02,830
That's how I knew him in the bills.

38
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,830
He goes down and I wanted
to attack him on the ground,

39
00:01:05,831 --> 00:01:06,641
but they pulled me off.

40
00:01:06,641 --> 00:01:07,380
And then,

41
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:07,960
uh,

42
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,160
core Hybris was in my corner.

43
00:01:09,161 --> 00:01:12,790
Now he brought all his friends was
he had hell's angels with him and,

44
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,660
and I had all my bosses friends with
me and they all started fighting.

45
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:17,494
They throw us,

46
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,150
they threw a chair into the ring.

47
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,000
It bounced off core hammers
says beck at LEDs behind me.

48
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,020
If you see the video,

49
00:01:23,021 --> 00:01:23,380
man,

50
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,310
it lags behind me.

51
00:01:24,311 --> 00:01:25,300
I looked behind me,

52
00:01:25,301 --> 00:01:25,930
I see the chair,

53
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,250
I sit in the chair while I watch.

54
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,490
And that later they cleared everybody.

55
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,960
Everybody's throwing down
because the referee took,

56
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,531
he says,

57
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:36,191
why did you do it?

58
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:36,401
I said,

59
00:01:36,401 --> 00:01:37,000
look at my ear.

60
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,980
And it was a hole straight through my air.

61
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,150
He bitched straight through my ear,

62
00:01:40,151 --> 00:01:43,280
a in there and then he grabbed a
microphone and he announced to everybody,

63
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:43,561
you know,

64
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,320
Whoa,

65
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,160
he's got a hole in his ear.

66
00:01:45,161 --> 00:01:45,731
He bit his ear.

67
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:46,331
That's why he did it.

68
00:01:46,331 --> 00:01:47,380
And then everybody calm down.

69
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,490
Oh Wow.

70
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,870
And did you continue to fight?

71
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:50,621
No,

72
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:50,741
no,

73
00:01:50,741 --> 00:01:50,891
no.

74
00:01:50,891 --> 00:01:51,590
That was it.

75
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,300
It was a hard knee.

76
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,570
And the idea of where we live twice as
long as our ancestors did a century ago,

77
00:01:58,571 --> 00:01:58,870
you know?

78
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,141
Yeah,

79
00:01:59,141 --> 00:01:59,651
that's true.

80
00:01:59,651 --> 00:02:04,390
But really no one's living above 120 just
more and more people are pushing up to

81
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:08,380
the upper ceiling because of public
health and just general stuff we do that

82
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,250
makes us healthier.

83
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,650
But in terms of longevity and aging,

84
00:02:11,651 --> 00:02:12,461
you can't stop it.

85
00:02:12,461 --> 00:02:15,810
All she could do is kind of hopefully
slow it down a little bit and,

86
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,780
and you want to have a higher quality
of life the further up you go as opposed

87
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:23,920
to lying in bed with tubes for the last
10 years of your life or something like

88
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:24,101
that.

89
00:02:24,101 --> 00:02:24,850
So that was,

90
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,380
that's where the future research is.

91
00:02:26,381 --> 00:02:27,550
Where the breakthroughs will come.

92
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:28,300
Not,

93
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,270
not radical life extension lists
that I've also written about.

94
00:02:31,271 --> 00:02:31,570
You know,

95
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,860
we're going to have 500 years,

96
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,870
the Schermer don't you
want to live 500 years?

97
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:35,704
Like look,

98
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,260
just get me to 90 without
Alzheimer's and cancer.

99
00:02:38,261 --> 00:02:38,950
Okay,

100
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,380
let's just start one decade at a time.

101
00:02:41,381 --> 00:02:42,280
It just easy,

102
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,240
you know,

103
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,030
because you know the
problems are really complex.

104
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,060
I think the quality of life thing
that you mentioned is one of the most

105
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:49,690
important things.

106
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,530
Like we have this phrase
that I've said many times,

107
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,340
but I'm going to say,

108
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,420
cause it fits right here.

109
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,920
We all love to sleep,

110
00:02:56,921 --> 00:02:58,240
but everyone's afraid to die.

111
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,730
We love to shut off.

112
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,050
We'd love to shut off at night.

113
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,300
Everybody loves it and
we look forward to it.

114
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:08,440
But that one big shutoff off when you're
not coming back is just too fucked up.

115
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,910
It's just too much.

116
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,160
Well,

117
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,993
it's inevitable.

118
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:12,941
This is my,

119
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:14,620
in my next book I have a chapter called,

120
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,120
uh,

121
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,540
afterlife for atheists.

122
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,150
So these are not just the
radical life extension is,

123
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:20,650
but the p the mine loaders.

124
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,241
And so,

125
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:22,451
you know,

126
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:24,190
you're going to scan your connectome,

127
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,270
put it in a computer,

128
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,141
and then you know,

129
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:29,000
you'll wake up in the computer like
Johnny Depp in that sentence mood.

130
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,243
Here's the problem.

131
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,550
When you go to sleep,

132
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,470
then you wake up tomorrow,

133
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:33,940
maybe you're groggy for a few minutes,

134
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:35,240
but you're,

135
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:35,570
you're,

136
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,310
you're back.

137
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,340
You still feel like you,

138
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,920
there's a continuity between today and
tomorrow or you get general anesthesia

139
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,640
surgery.

140
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,130
You wake up groggy or
for a little bit longer,

141
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:46,660
but the continuity comes back.

142
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:47,494
It's still you.

143
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,001
So the question is,

144
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:49,930
is if you're,

145
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,320
you die and we have a scan of your
connectome and we put it in a computer and

146
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:56,284
turn it on,

147
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,890
are you going to wake up in the
computer like you did from sleep?

148
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,090
And I don't think so.

149
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,400
I think it would just be a copy of your,

150
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,840
if this could ever be done,

151
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:07,120
which is very unlikely because
it's super hard problem.

152
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,560
But let's just say it could.

153
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,813
Um,

154
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,750
I,

155
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,720
I think there's a break
in continuity from death.

156
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,561
You're dead.

157
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:15,160
That's it.

158
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,350
And this thing we have is a copy of you.

159
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:22,470
It would be like if we cloned your body
and then you die and then we reconstruct

160
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:23,680
the body and there you are.

161
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,060
That's not you.

162
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,980
Not first person through the eyes.

163
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,330
Me,

164
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,530
it's just a copy of me.

165
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,270
I've always had this rose colored view
of us and I acknowledged that it's a

166
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:34,870
myth,

167
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,270
but I always look at the
myth of America as I call it,

168
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:39,700
the 1950s high school
textbook view of America.

169
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,220
That to me is what I want to move towards.

170
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,400
So when they talk about
creating a more perfect union,

171
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:50,170
that to me is the goal and anything that
conflicts with that self image to me is

172
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:50,950
the problem.

173
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,520
So when you see sometimes how we really
operate anything Dick Cheney does,

174
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,290
and I don't use the word evil,

175
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,650
so I'll use the word nefarious
Dick Cheney is to me,

176
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,101
when you say,

177
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:01,450
what do you want to avoid in this country?

178
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:05,230
I want to avoid where Dick Cheney wants
us to go because nothing conflicts with

179
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:10,231
my 1950s mythological American textbook
idea than what Cheney wants us to be.

180
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,030
And when you look at some
of the things we'd done,

181
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:16,450
some of the things based
on that 1947 1948 America,

182
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,300
which we thought could we have to do
everything to stop global communism?

183
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,380
They're going to take over the country.

184
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,410
Why don't you look at some of the things
we did and you realize some of what

185
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:25,030
we're dealing with today is blow back.

186
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,220
You don't know how to undo that.

187
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:27,431
I mean,

188
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:29,000
you almost think it's
like permanent damage.

189
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,730
Look at the way some in
the Middle East see us.

190
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:31,480
I mean,

191
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:31,760
uh,

192
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,001
I'll,

193
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:33,010
I'll talk to people like,

194
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:36,160
I remember talking to Sam Harris about
this and he was talking about what you

195
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:37,420
have to see things this certain way.

196
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:37,901
And I said yes,

197
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:39,520
but that's not going to
help you solve the problem.

198
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:42,130
How do you solve the
problem if we've already,

199
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,180
if we've already soiled our beds so much
that you don't know how to fix that,

200
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:46,841
you don't know how to go and say,

201
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:47,081
listen,

202
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:47,771
we're sorry about this.

203
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:48,850
Can we start from scratch?

204
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,490
You can't do that in foreign affairs.

205
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,510
Just like you can't do it
with the mainframe computer.

206
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,321
That is the government,

207
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:53,860
you know?

208
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,910
I can't figure out how to,

209
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,790
how to reverse course to a point
where we can once again fix stuff.

210
00:05:58,791 --> 00:05:59,001
Right?

211
00:05:59,001 --> 00:05:59,240
It's,

212
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,440
it's too damaged.

213
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,470
I think it just has to
dry out slowly but surely.

214
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:03,681
Look,

215
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:07,880
all the wounds of the past have to heal
up and dry out and it just takes time.

216
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,270
Deal generation.

217
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:09,980
Do you mean rate?

218
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,500
We've already made enough people
mad at us so that thereafter us,

219
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,320
well now we have to go protect
ourselves by going and getting them.

220
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:16,820
So we perpetuate the cycle.

221
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:19,490
Like I can't figure out how to
jump off the merry go round.

222
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:20,240
Do you know what I mean?

223
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,680
I don't think it moves that way.

224
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,340
I think we're trying to make a battleship
move like a race car and I just think

225
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:30,341
it takes a long time to shift course and
when we're looking at these people that

226
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:34,430
are in the Middle East that are opposing
the u s right now and angry and want

227
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,540
attack the US right now,

228
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,850
you're most likely never
going to get to them.

229
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,800
You might get to their grandchildren.

230
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,350
And I think that might be the only way.

231
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,780
Things slowly but surely settled down.

232
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,950
And that's the argument for the NSA and
the CIA to continue to monitor things

233
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:52,820
that are really kind of ridiculous and
invasive level because there's so many

234
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:55,730
people out there that hate
us or hate the government,

235
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:57,720
hate the military and hate
what's happened to them.

236
00:06:57,721 --> 00:07:01,190
And so many martyrs are created every
time a drone strike was going to go,

237
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:01,640
how do you,

238
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,210
how do you,

239
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,630
how do you get that next generation to
not hate us when we're busy killing their

240
00:07:05,631 --> 00:07:07,310
parents because their
parents want to kill us?

241
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,910
That's the cycle and I can't
figure out how to break the cycle.

242
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,570
How do you protect ourselves from their
anti American parents in a way that

243
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:16,310
doesn't turn them against us too?

244
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,144
Does that make sense?

245
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:25,950
Okay.
