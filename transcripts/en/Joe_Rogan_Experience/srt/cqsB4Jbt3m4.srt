1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,840
Try by day Joe Rogan
podcast by night all day.

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:05,400
How about Oh

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,833
God,

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:08,161
Dude.

5
00:00:08,161 --> 00:00:10,350
How about Steve Bay's ground
and pound on over him?

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,240
Dude,

7
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:11,830
overeat.

8
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,050
Thinking about that this whole time,

9
00:00:13,051 --> 00:00:16,410
like how fucking hard did he hit him
with those three shots of shots talking.

10
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:17,100
Perfect,

11
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,731
perfect place.

12
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:20,520
Like I was stalking him earlier and he'd
get fucking hitting the guy in the head

13
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,690
and where you to start
him on the triangle.

14
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:23,170
I'm like fucking day hits.

15
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,230
Steve Bay shots had been fucking
but also Overeem's not exact.

16
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,240
You know he's,

17
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,320
he's his motherboard message board
has been hit a bunch of times.

18
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,220
Well that's why after the fight I said
I don't want to do interviews with

19
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:36,720
fighters after they got knocked out again.

20
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,673
I appreciate it.

21
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,780
We should never do it all.

22
00:00:38,781 --> 00:00:40,620
I appreciate it that when he said that,

23
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,490
when he said that as I was watching,

24
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,130
I don't fucking talk.

25
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,420
When he said the guy tapped,

26
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:45,990
I was like,

27
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,471
fuck.

28
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:50,070
Imagine if he tapped like are we going
to see a task like I had no idea.

29
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:50,700
You don't,

30
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,060
you don't know if you miss something
during the actual calling of a fight

31
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:57,180
because it's happening live and it's
so chaotic and it's right after Alister

32
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:57,691
dropped him,

33
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:58,950
then he went for the guillotine.

34
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,510
Then all of a sudden
they're on their feet again.

35
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,000
It happened so fast when he said it,

36
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:04,020
he was so adamant.

37
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,093
We not Scott.

38
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,030
I know.

39
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,440
What about the truck in the back though,

40
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,333
Joe?

41
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:09,870
Aren't they going Joe,

42
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:10,651
he didn't tap.

43
00:01:10,651 --> 00:01:11,580
Do you really want to show that?

44
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:12,360
They don't know.

45
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,193
They don't know.

46
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:14,610
Fight.

47
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:15,480
They watched the fight live.

48
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:16,250
Find out.

49
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,040
So find out where they did you
find out it's entertaining.

50
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,470
It's totally possible.

51
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,950
If he did tap that someone
saw it in the truck,

52
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,903
they would have said it,

53
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,080
but they didn't say it.

54
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:28,740
But they're like,

55
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,190
we're gonna,

56
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:29,941
we'll play it for you.

57
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:30,361
And I said,

58
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:30,580
okay,

59
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:30,930
we're gonna,

60
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:31,763
we're gonna play it.

61
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,360
And so they had a cute up,

62
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:35,580
they played it and then
he was still insistent.

63
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:35,791
I'm like,

64
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:35,971
okay,

65
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,140
well maybe it's the other hand,

66
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,371
but I was thinking,

67
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:38,551
man,

68
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:39,480
this is not look good.

69
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,050
And then,

70
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:40,883
but I'm like,

71
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,810
but it has to be solved.

72
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,130
It has to be resolved.

73
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:44,521
You know,

74
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,720
when a guy says the guy tapped,

75
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,730
handled to show champion part of the game.

76
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:48,160
If you check it,

77
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,993
you have to show it,

78
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,690
show it those throat.

79
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,370
But I wish we didn't interview him at all.

80
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:53,940
I wish,

81
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,151
you know,

82
00:01:54,151 --> 00:01:55,830
I think you guys did have a chance to,

83
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:59,490
he was completely unconscious and it took
them a while to skip back to his feet

84
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,510
and to have a conversation
with him about the strategy,

85
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,210
about where it went wrong and it's crazy.

86
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,410
It doesn't make any sense

87
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,850
I've ever,

88
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,740
but he doesn't have the leg it all right,

89
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,240
switch it to a dark.

90
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:20,270
This is a serious shit and got a guy
get losers and it gets submitted it or

91
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:21,020
whatever.

92
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,853
Fuck,

93
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,281
this sucks.

94
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:26,460
I wish I would have won even in other
sports like Bennett fl for God's

95
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:27,290
concussion.

96
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,290
He's not doing interviews,

97
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:28,471
man.

98
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:30,780
He's not writing the
head guy breaks his leg.

99
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,441
Ours a need.

100
00:02:31,441 --> 00:02:33,870
They're not interviewing him
because what the is he going to eat?

101
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,650
You don't kind of fucking frame
of mind that guys in dark,

102
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,810
so you're 100% right Joe.

103
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:40,470
I love that.

104
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,160
Well,

105
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,450
you know it something I had suggested a
long time ago back when we interviewed

106
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,510
Mirko Cro cop after
Gonzaga knocked him out.

107
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,670
I was looking in his eyes that night.

108
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,504
You guys interviewed,

109
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,220
interviewed them right after
the fight and I was like,

110
00:02:56,221 --> 00:02:57,180
we can't do that anymore.

111
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,980
And I said it to him and
we just kept dealing it.

112
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,250
What if it's good for ratings?

113
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:00,851
Like they get it.

114
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:01,631
They get knocked out.

115
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:03,190
Guaranteed interview you want.

116
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:04,180
They can't be good though.

117
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,193
I'm not doing anything.

118
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,910
They don't even show them
on the ground anymore.

119
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:08,140
They pan away on the camera.

120
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,210
They tell you a yes or
no Joe or I don't care.

121
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,333
I'm not doing anymore.

122
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,071
You're going to do that.

123
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:12,671
I'm not doing it,

124
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:12,980
sir.

125
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,140
I want you guys getting shut.

126
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:14,974
The fuck you're going to

127
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,710
talk to.

128
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,240
If guys get knocked the fuck out,

129
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,820
if someone really wants to talk to them,

130
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,050
they're going to have to talk to him.

131
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,530
I'm not,

132
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,360
I'm not talking to above was
going to jump in that bitch.

133
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:26,194
How you fail.

134
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:28,670
Well,

135
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,780
let's take it from here.

136
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,470
It's time for me to interview you,

137
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:33,251
Joe.

138
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:34,084
I'll take it from here.

139
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:34,511
Thank you,

140
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:34,990
sir.

141
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:35,980
I know you hate this part.

142
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,240
I got a raise.

143
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,680
I'm doing it out of respect for the game.

144
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,243
Yeah.

145
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,330
I don't think we need to,

146
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:43,750
and I don't think,

147
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,950
I think the UFC agrees.

148
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,150
It's just,

149
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,080
it's better for the sport.

150
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,880
What made Alster look bad?

151
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,290
And I think if you gave him a few
hours or even a day to talk about it,

152
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,240
he probably would realize
that that never happened.

153
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:55,781
It was just,

154
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:56,800
his brain was scrambled.

155
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,101
Well,

156
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:57,950
even Steve Bay,

157
00:03:57,951 --> 00:03:58,541
when you're talking to him,

158
00:03:58,541 --> 00:03:58,781
he's like,

159
00:03:58,781 --> 00:03:58,991
hey,

160
00:03:58,991 --> 00:03:59,771
hit me with a kick.

161
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:00,281
No Sir.

162
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,050
That was a,

163
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,250
well,

164
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,550
he said the guys takes hard,

165
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,840
hard to get a sense of.

166
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:04,490
Yeah.

167
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,430
Talking about he did get
kicked hard in the body.

168
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,403
He did.

169
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,040
And uh,

170
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,290
I mean,

171
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,760
he could have been mentioning that,

172
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:11,680
but he probably didn't
realize what knocked him down.

173
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:12,570
He was concussed to.

174
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,120
Yeah.

175
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,751
Most likely.

176
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:14,584
Yeah.

177
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:23,470
Okay.
