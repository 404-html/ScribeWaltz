00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,840
Trey my day,
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,180
And if you don't have this full range of
options and possibilities inside the

3
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:11,940
octagon,
you're most likely limiting yourself.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,900
Agreed.
Agreed.

5
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:13,890
I see that.
Yeah,

6
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:16,260
possibilities are nice when you change
things up.

7
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:17,250
And again,
like we said earlier,

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,620
confused the brain,
get them thinking about something else

9
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:21,690
and then you do something else.
So that's always nice.

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,480
But I think right now we're seeing like,
um,

11
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,830
there's a,
there's a pack,

12
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:28,190
right?
There's like the standard pack of,

13
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:32,040
of athletes that are doing things in a
certain way and then there's a few that

14
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:37,041
are moving away from the pack and
they're expanding the potential of MMA.

15
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:39,840
I think you're one of those people.
I appreciate that.

16
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:42,480
And I thank you for sure.
And one of those coaches,

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,350
and there's a few guys out there I know
you don't like to hear,

18
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,500
but Dominick Cruz is one of them.

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,720
He's also doing it.
And we were,

20
00:00:47,721 --> 00:00:52,170
we were talking about him today that
like his style is so fucking odd.

21
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,810
You know,
it's technically not sound actually,

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,120
but you know,
but he uses it the right way is he's got

23
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:59,220
awesome timing.
He's got a great cardio,

24
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:02,670
he's got a great Chin and then he can
get away with the bad things he does

25
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:04,710
cause he does them for the right way for
himself.

26
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,230
You know,
I don't necessarily think you can say

27
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:11,730
it's technically bad because he's so
fucking successful and he knows how to

28
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:14,040
do it.
I just think it's not standard.

29
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,620
You know,
like he doesn't like we're using Ramon

30
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:19,260
Dekkers as an example.
He does not throw kicks and punches like

31
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:22,200
Ramon Dekkers.
But what he does do is he throws him

32
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:26,280
like Dominick Cruz where he's moving
like a pendulum back and forth and it's

33
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:30,270
footwork is so weird and he's
overwhelming your mind with

34
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:33,330
possibilities and he doesn't do the same
thing twice.

35
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,170
He mixes things up so well that he's a
tough nut to crack.

36
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,450
Did he?
He's tricky.

37
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:41,570
He is trickier than I expected for sure
though.

38
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,391
You know,
a piece of that,

39
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:44,850
again,
game planning is the talks up to the

40
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:48,420
fight to get them emotionally invested
and then it becomes a bit trickier to

41
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:49,890
find the head.
Right.

42
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:51,570
So that's the goal.
When you were,

43
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:54,420
when you were leading up to the fight,
he was talking so much yet,

44
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,520
and you could tell that you were getting
so upset,

45
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:58,830
but that is a big factor in fights,
right?

46
00:01:58,831 --> 00:02:02,910
Because fights are so emotional because
it's one of the only sports in the world

47
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,360
where your health is on the line.
Like literally like this,

48
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:08,580
the option,
it's not like you might get in a car

49
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:11,490
accident when you're racing cars that
that's a possibility.

50
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,540
But the goal of MMA is for you to fuck
up someone's body.

51
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,070
Yeah,
absolutely man.

52
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,200
Um,
the thing that I think with him too that

53
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:22,620
makes it pisses you off so much is that
he'll attack anything and just talk

54
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:25,860
about some of the Disney makes sense
just to talk and talk louder and faster

55
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,050
and not dot give you a chance to talk.
It's like a high school girls just like

56
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,030
bickering at each other.
I think that's what pisses you off the

57
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:33,451
most,
you know,

58
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:35,070
cause he's not even actually making a
great point.

59
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,080
He's just making it and making it
louder.

60
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,280
Voice.
Very articulate.

61
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,330
Yeah,
it was good.

62
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:41,090
Good analyst because of that,
you know,

63
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,670
and greed technique.
If you get a chance to find him again

64
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:47,550
for the title,
I bet you're paying the line.

65
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:48,090
Yeah,
right.

66
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,520
Obviously.
Well you lost a very close decision to

67
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:52,280
him and then you beat hot valence son
South,

68
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,100
which in my opinion was a,
we were talking about this today was an

69
00:02:56,101 --> 00:02:59,170
excellent example of how far you
progressed because you guys had a really

70
00:02:59,171 --> 00:02:59,740
tough fight.

71
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,480
The first time he fought it was a close
fight.

72
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,580
This fight was not close,
so you just ran away from him and went,

73
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,770
ran away with the,
uh,

74
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:07,630
the fight rather not wearing away from
him,

75
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,501
but rent.
I mean,

76
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:10,780
you were just,
it was a clear victory.

77
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,000
It's like you just were so much more
technical.

78
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:16,090
There was so many more options you were
presenting to him and he was basically

79
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:19,060
the same fighter that he was back then.
Maybe slightly better,

80
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,820
but you're all way better.
Fine.

81
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,540
I appreciate him and we,
we've worked hard.

82
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,580
We've worked long hours where it's
really hard.

83
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,110
Um,
you know,

84
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:27,220
it's crazy how the,
like you said,

85
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:28,960
the sport works out how quick things can
change.

86
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:31,390
You know what I mean?
I could be on 11 fight win streak right

87
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:34,030
now,
and a split decision loss to have fail

88
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:34,840
since.
So,

89
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,490
you know,
I thought I won that fight,

90
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,430
a very close fight with Dominick Cruz
that I felt I want as well.

91
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,160
Those two fights go my way.
I'm on 11 fight win streak.

92
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:43,750
You still have the belt,
you know,

93
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:46,600
known as hopefully one of the greatest
comp pound fighters in the world,

94
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,280
you know,
and we still sell stuff for sure.

95
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:58,350
Okay.
