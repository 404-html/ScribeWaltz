1
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:04,463
Three two,

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,423
one.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:06,830
Justin Wren,

4
00:00:06,831 --> 00:00:07,700
ladies and gentlemen,

5
00:00:07,701 --> 00:00:08,570
come on.

6
00:00:08,571 --> 00:00:12,020
How low fella with the silky
hair and they're beautiful beard.

7
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:12,411
Oh,

8
00:00:12,411 --> 00:00:13,430
thank you so much for having me.

9
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,031
My pleasure,

10
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:14,421
my brother.

11
00:00:14,421 --> 00:00:15,410
How's things man?

12
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,273
Things are good.

13
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,001
Things are really good.

14
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:17,181
I mean,

15
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:20,630
last night you didn't go to the comedy
store for the first time and seeing all

16
00:00:20,631 --> 00:00:22,820
those legends and just being
a legendary atmosphere.

17
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:23,031
I mean,

18
00:00:23,031 --> 00:00:23,320
it was,

19
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,800
it was seriously an incredible time.

20
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,761
It's a fun place,

21
00:00:25,761 --> 00:00:26,090
right?

22
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:26,360
Yeah.

23
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:26,721
I mean,

24
00:00:26,721 --> 00:00:28,130
and you had this role in a,

25
00:00:28,131 --> 00:00:28,950
so it was,

26
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,660
it was really fun and got to see Brennan
and Brian Cowen first and then you,

27
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,070
and so it was just hilarious.

28
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,840
Did you get to go to the upstairs
room as well or did you add the two?

29
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,410
I was in the,

30
00:00:39,411 --> 00:00:40,620
the belly room is upstairs.

31
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:41,150
Okay.

32
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,170
I'm Brandon and Brian
were in the main room.

33
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:43,551
I was there.

34
00:00:43,551 --> 00:00:44,870
I was in the original room,

35
00:00:44,871 --> 00:00:45,760
which that was an original.

36
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:46,430
Yeah.

37
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,640
So I didn't get to go to
the top two might tonight.

38
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:49,483
I'll show you the top.

39
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,570
It's a bizarre little place.

40
00:00:50,571 --> 00:00:52,580
There's three comedy clubs in one place.

41
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:52,970
Yeah,

42
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:53,540
it was.

43
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,170
It was awesome.

44
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:54,411
Yeah,

45
00:00:54,411 --> 00:00:55,130
it's fucking great.

46
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:55,390
Yeah.

47
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:55,510
Good.

48
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,343
Walking around,

49
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,320
seeing all the history,

50
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,460
seeing everyone get amped and then being
able to be that close to the comedians

51
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,990
too is pretty awesome.

52
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:03,321
I mean,

53
00:01:03,321 --> 00:01:04,190
being able to meet him,

54
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,600
say hi and just,

55
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:05,811
uh,

56
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:06,141
you're,

57
00:01:06,141 --> 00:01:07,460
you're an arm's distance from them.

58
00:01:07,461 --> 00:01:08,600
So really unique.

59
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,890
If anyone hasn't gone,

60
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,510
I suggest going because it was awesome.

61
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:11,721
Yeah.

62
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:15,200
I think Chappelle is
filmed his Netflix special.

63
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:18,080
His next one he did
there in the belly room.

64
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,000
I watched him work one of them out.

65
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:21,260
I don't think he was filming then,

66
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,513
but I'm not sure.

67
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,150
Comes out soon.

68
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,600
Right.

69
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,870
Does it tick weirdly announced
that it comes out this month?

70
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:28,440
I think.

71
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:28,891
Whoa.

72
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:29,940
I'll double check on that real quick.

73
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:33,360
But I think so that might be
the case because it's so small.

74
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,020
There's probably not a lot of
camera angles and I know he'd deal,

75
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,550
he filmed a lot of shows,

76
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,770
so maybe he just wants to just get one
of them perfect and then throw it out.

77
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,240
But he had a lot of like
really topical material.

78
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,760
Real real current material was the,

79
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,100
was it smaller than the
room that you were in?

80
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:49,350
Lessening?

81
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,601
Yeah.

82
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:49,831
Yeah,

83
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:50,000
yeah.

84
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,650
Yeah.

85
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,110
We're not even half the size.

86
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,470
Wow.

87
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah.

88
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,320
See,

89
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,153
that's incredible.

90
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,230
December 31st that's crazy.

91
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,490
They don't have a video here,

92
00:01:57,491 --> 00:01:59,680
but this is equanimity
is what it's called.

93
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,043
Nice.

94
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,011
It was funny,

95
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:05,431
man.

96
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:05,810
He's,

97
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:06,290
he's,

98
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,460
it was really funny and it,

99
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,480
and seeing him in that tiny little room,

100
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,190
like there was 70 people in the room.

101
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:11,820
Oh Wow.

102
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,653
Yeah.

103
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,370
They did get more in there sometimes,

104
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:17,610
but don't tell the fire department
fucking shouldn't speak in the fire

105
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:18,444
department.

106
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:18,961
Oh Man.

107
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:19,794
It's crazy out here,

108
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,580
huh?

109
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,330
Yeah.

110
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:21,631
I mean,

111
00:02:21,631 --> 00:02:24,120
I seen that video posts on your Instagram.

112
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,950
It's seriously looks like Armageddon.

113
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,351
Yeah.

114
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:28,290
That's from bar to bar stool sports.

115
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,910
If anybody wants to go
to their Instagram page,

116
00:02:29,911 --> 00:02:30,100
they,

117
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:35,100
somebody put up a video of a last
night driving up the four oh five gosh.

118
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:36,960
It's the craziest thing.

119
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:38,820
You don't ever say it's
an entire mountain.

120
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,340
What's crazy is that's bel air.

121
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,481
I mean,

122
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:44,670
that's like a really ritzy area.

123
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,530
Super expensive houses,

124
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,860
and that fire is just raging towards them.

125
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,330
It's right near the Getty center.

126
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,980
And what apparently with their calling,

127
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:54,690
this is a dry hurricane.

128
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,070
Wow.

129
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,800
So I don't live in California
and I'm not a homeowner yet.

130
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,220
But does home owner insurance cover all
that or do you have to have extra lake

131
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:06,010
fire insurance is a very good
question and I don't know the answer.

132
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:06,590
Yeah,

133
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,030
cause my,

134
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,640
my family was in Hurricane
Katrina and because they,

135
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,150
they had hurricane insurance but
they didn't have like wind insurance.

136
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:18,070
And so why insurance companies and say
or flooding insurance or something like

137
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:18,191
that.

138
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:19,690
It was whatever you didn't have,

139
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,040
you would get one and not the other.

140
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,900
And so then whatever you didn't have,

141
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:24,550
that's what the insurance
company would claim.

142
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,660
Well you didn't have this and that's what
you should have had or losing tons of

143
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:28,871
money.

144
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:29,290
Their homes,

145
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,070
whole homes.

146
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,780
My family lost a whole
roof off their house.

147
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,081
Ah,

148
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:33,040
these monsters.

149
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,311
Yeah.

150
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:34,150
And so that's what I'm wondering.

151
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:34,301
Like you,

152
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:34,541
okay,

153
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,590
you have a homeowner insurance,

154
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:39,010
but do you have fire insurance
and are they going to cover that?

155
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,430
You know,

156
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,150
if those are,

157
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,880
if that's bel air and that's
build million dollar homes,

158
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:44,350
hopefully they have the right insurance.

159
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,810
I'm sure some people have fire insurance.

160
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:47,740
I know it's a thing,

161
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,040
just like hurricane and flood
insurance is also a thing,

162
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,810
but do have fire hurricane,

163
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,740
it's a good question.

164
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:54,761
Well,

165
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:55,031
yeah,

166
00:03:55,031 --> 00:03:55,864
right.

167
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,170
This is a fire arcane.

168
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,420
It's not just a hurricane.

169
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:58,811
Well,

170
00:03:58,811 --> 00:03:59,170
it's a,

171
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:03,460
they're calling it a dry hurricane
mean there's dryer or there's no water,

172
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,090
but it's,

173
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,100
it's hurricane gale force winds,

174
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,360
gale force.

175
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,110
I don't know if that's right.

176
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,220
Hurricane force winds.

177
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,660
It's technically not like,

178
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:11,110
you know,

179
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,943
in my hotel.

180
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:12,830
I mean,

181
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,760
wind was just ripping all last night and
they know that there's those fires out

182
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:15,910
there.

183
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,091
I mean,

184
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:16,650
that's crazy.

185
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,230
Yeah,

186
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,130
it's insane,

187
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:18,700
man.

188
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,470
Um,

189
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:19,600
I,

190
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,051
where I live,

191
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,190
I was evacuated twice.

192
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,091
Oh my gosh.

193
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:22,391
Yeah.

194
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:26,410
Twice in the early two thousands
where the fire got so close.

195
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:28,420
It was within a mile of my house.

196
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,823
And you know,

197
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,630
when it hits in,

198
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:32,590
the wind goes,

199
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,450
it can take over.

200
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,860
Like it can just run.

201
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:39,430
They said that the fires that they
were having in northern California,

202
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,690
we're going through an entire
football field every six seconds.

203
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,033
Gosh,

204
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,550
that,

205
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,600
that's mind blowing.

206
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,250
Fuck man.

207
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,960
Just imagine watching that,

208
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:52,410
watching fires just cut
through a football field,

209
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,950
hundred yards every six seconds.

210
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,840
It's almost like those clouds
and the storms are rolling.

211
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,230
Yeah.

212
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,400
You're just watching those go by.

213
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,610
A lot of people died in those
northern California fires too.

214
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:01,540
They just got stuck.

215
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,650
There's nowhere to get out.

216
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,550
And they apparently like
that whole Napa area is,

217
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,750
have you ever been up there?

218
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,790
No Yam before the fires.

219
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:10,840
I don't know what it looks like right now,

220
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:12,130
but it kind of is beautiful.

221
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,790
It's where they do all the wine making,

222
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:14,843
you know?

223
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:15,750
And um,

224
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:16,721
we actually,

225
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:17,020
uh,

226
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,250
went Turkey hunting up there.

227
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,180
Me and Brian Cowen.

228
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:19,751
Oh Nice.

229
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:20,051
Yeah.

230
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:23,920
Steve Rinella took us up there and
we were up there and we were like,

231
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:24,221
God,

232
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:25,270
this is so gorgeous.

233
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:27,850
But it's like semi rural,

234
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,120
but then a big tourist
vacation destination too.

235
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:33,820
It's like people come there for those
wine tasting things and everything.

236
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,800
Apparently a giant chunk of that
part of the state just got lit up.

237
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:39,940
And when you,

238
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,110
when you go Turkey hunting,

239
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:42,490
are you using a boat?

240
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,590
Are you using this shotgun shot guns?

241
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:45,970
This was for the media to show.

242
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,500
So do you have to like go for their,

243
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,360
their head,

244
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,570
right?

245
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,000
Yeah.

246
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,810
That's nuts.

247
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,820
So cause you can't get their
body or it goes everywhere,

248
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:52,180
right?

249
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,280
Well then you have to
pull out all the led,

250
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:54,580
you know,

251
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,310
which you like when people shoot smaller
birds like pheasants and things along

252
00:05:58,311 --> 00:05:58,821
those lines.

253
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:00,530
You do shoot the entire body.

254
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,420
But with the Turkey you basically sitting
still and you call a menu bar and make

255
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:06,110
this little,

256
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:10,300
they get this little sound thing in your
hand or you have one in your mouth and

257
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,490
you make little Turkey calls and the
turkeys come in and just blast him in the

258
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:14,960
head or,

259
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,610
or you shoot him in the body,

260
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,241
uh,

261
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:18,074
with a bow.

262
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:18,770
Um,

263
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,321
I know,

264
00:06:19,321 --> 00:06:19,550
uh,

265
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,410
my friend John Dudley
and lot of those guys,

266
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:22,490
they hunt with bows and they've,

267
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,780
they shoot turkeys for the bow.

268
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,350
But it's tricky because the
Turkey's a goddamn dinosaur.

269
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,610
And if you don't hit it in the right spot,

270
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:30,530
they'll just fly away with an
Arrow sticking out of them.

271
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,723
Like literally.

272
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,090
Well,

273
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,420
something that kills a deer go right
through a Turkey and the Turkey.

274
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:36,140
He's like,

275
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,973
I'm Outta here.

276
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,500
Like you have to catch
them and their vitals,

277
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,280
their vitals are,

278
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,130
you literally are shooting an
Arrow at a soft ball from you know,

279
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,983
40 yards.

280
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,003
Yeah.

281
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,560
Well may have seen this
new space is awesome.

282
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,010
I mean this is incredible new studio and
seeing that your targets are up there

283
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:52,191
yet.

284
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:52,461
Got What?

285
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:54,260
48 40 47 yards.

286
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:55,550
70 yards indoors.

287
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:56,060
Yeah,

288
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,960
but when you come back,

289
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:57,291
man,

290
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,310
we'll have a full gym.

291
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,410
You'll be able to work
out and the whole deal.

292
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:00,830
Yeah,

293
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,011
no,

294
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:01,731
that's awesome dude.

295
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:04,480
After you watch the UFC and
you saw Frances and gone,

296
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:09,290
oh did you see if you could make two
oh five that's a lot of people don't.

297
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,124
A lot of people are like,

298
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,143
I could make,

299
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,590
I could make to a five.

300
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,750
I think it's totally possible.

301
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,800
I've always been against it,

302
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:16,634
but now I'm thinking about it.

303
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,701
Just getting by.

304
00:07:18,701 --> 00:07:18,860
He,

305
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,100
man,

306
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,670
he's,

307
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,790
he is a monster.

308
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:25,610
It's terrifying monster to see
how far he sent the Overeem.

309
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,290
Sad.

310
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,160
It was just backwards in that one photo.

311
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:29,120
That's like an iconic,

312
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,920
that's probably the most iconic,

313
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:31,754
at least in my mind.

314
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,330
Um,

315
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,390
or epic heavyweight
fighting MMA fighting photo,

316
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,290
um,

317
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:36,920
that there is,

318
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,591
I mean with the thing,

319
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:41,090
so to knock back that way and I mean
it just looks like such a power.

320
00:07:41,091 --> 00:07:42,080
I mean it was a powerful punch,

321
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:45,170
but the timing of that
shot was just incredible.

322
00:07:45,171 --> 00:07:48,580
You see that one where his head
is just really knocked back man.

323
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,041
Scary.

324
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:49,501
Scary dude.

325
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:51,740
I put that one on my
Instagram feed to that.

326
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:56,480
That picture seems like
the coming of the new king,

327
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,380
you know what I mean?

328
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,360
Like obviously he's got to
beat Steve Bay Meo Chick,

329
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:00,860
but if you want to like look at a picture,

330
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:02,420
like in history when you come back and go,

331
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:07,010
this is the moment where in Ghana
arrived and people realize like,

332
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,630
Holy Shit,

333
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,030
like this guy is for real.

334
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,710
He didn't just do that to any guy.

335
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,930
He did that to Allister
motherfucking over.

336
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,470
Yeah.

337
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,150
K One kickboxing world champion.

338
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:17,750
Yeah.

339
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,250
Strikeforce world champion.

340
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,720
Just a stud.

341
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,360
But like elite fighter.

342
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:23,870
Yeah.

343
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,490
Number one heavyweight contender.

344
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:26,121
Yeah.

345
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:26,551
Well you,

346
00:08:26,551 --> 00:08:29,180
you and Brendan were talking
about it last week on the show.

347
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,750
And to hear you guys saying if
he starches him and if he can,

348
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:33,800
if he can prove himself in,

349
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:34,101
it's like,

350
00:08:34,101 --> 00:08:34,640
man,

351
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,530
he just did it the best way possible.

352
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,790
And the way he did it,

353
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,800
it's like the whole world's noticing,

354
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,420
like I saw it on CNN,

355
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,900
I saw it on all these different
websites and they're just,

356
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,480
everyone's just raving like he
could be the next big thing.

357
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,540
And I think that's going to put them
on the map now that everybody knows and

358
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:53,540
they have this highlight
reel of his knockouts now.

359
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:53,820
Yeah.

360
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,460
And so the,

361
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,430
the advertise a fight
between him and Steve Bay,

362
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:57,930
I think it's going to be gigantic.

363
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,350
Yeah.

364
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,220
I think it's gonna be huge.

365
00:08:59,700 --> 00:08:59,920
Uh,

366
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,150
I've been able to talk with Steve based
coach and there's a potential I was

367
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:04,070
going to go out and help them,

368
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,440
uh,

369
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,340
in this training camp.

370
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:07,020
So hopefully that still happens.

371
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:08,040
My schedule is kind of crazy,

372
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,350
but hopefully I can get up there
for a week or sneak up there.

373
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,100
Um,

374
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:11,341
I'm,

375
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:12,540
I'm happy for steep bed.

376
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,440
He'd get a big fight.

377
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:13,830
Yeah,

378
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,221
for sure.

379
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,010
And if he wins against in Ghana,

380
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:17,341
I mean,

381
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:19,140
that is just gigantic.

382
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,470
Yeah,

383
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,210
that would be absolutely phenomenal.

384
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,470
There's a guy that can do it.

385
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,700
Steve Bay for sure.

386
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,061
Well,

387
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:26,130
he's the champ and he's
a champ for a reason,

388
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,380
but he's got a lot of work to do.

389
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,970
He's so big.

390
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,690
Got to weather that storm it put them
up against the cage where I'm out.

391
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:34,200
Pomo.

392
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,441
I mean,

393
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:34,750
just,

394
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,380
just get really heavy on
them and a tire amount.

395
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:37,960
Dan,

396
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,630
a deep waters put them on his back.

397
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,450
We've got to remember Overeem
did get him up against the cage.

398
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:42,631
Yeah,

399
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:42,961
that's true.

400
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:43,810
Dream lunged at,

401
00:09:43,811 --> 00:09:44,790
I'm clenched with him.

402
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,420
Got Him up against the but couldn't
do a God damn thing with them.

403
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:48,763
That's true.

404
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,020
I think a little differences.

405
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,501
A steep way.

406
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:54,620
Having that all American wrestling
background when they're a little bit more

407
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,350
crazy.

408
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,030
He's opening up as the betting
favorite over the heavyweight champion.

409
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:58,890
Steep Emile chick.

410
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,221
I mean,

411
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:00,720
this is an amazing,

412
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,081
I mean,

413
00:10:01,081 --> 00:10:01,650
I get it,

414
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,483
I understand,

415
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,120
but that is pretty incredible
that he's the betting favorite.

416
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,600
I guess if we just look at his
comment that do MMA math or so,

417
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:09,841
but,

418
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:10,050
uh,

419
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:10,291
the,

420
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,124
uh,

421
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,150
the common opponent with the Elman over
him and you know how they both performed

422
00:10:15,151 --> 00:10:15,810
against him?

423
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,380
Yeah,

424
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,730
well Overeem did catch the bay and had
him stunned and knocked him on his house

425
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:22,290
and then Steve Bay came back and won.

426
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,970
But you know,

427
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,350
he's going to be obviously super aware
of how dangerous it is to connect with in

428
00:10:28,351 --> 00:10:32,390
Ghana and he's going to obviously
try to stay on the outside and uh,

429
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,630
when he closes the distance,

430
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:34,231
close distance,

431
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:34,921
get that clinch,

432
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:38,190
get him up against the cage and figure
out some way to either get that guy down

433
00:10:38,191 --> 00:10:40,560
or where his legs out or do something.

434
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,110
We don't know what happens when
in Ghana goes into the third,

435
00:10:43,111 --> 00:10:43,411
fourth,

436
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:44,051
and fifth rounds.

437
00:10:44,051 --> 00:10:44,400
Right.

438
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,530
If anybody can even
physically take him there.

439
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,280
Yeah,

440
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,390
I do love how steep it has that killer
instinct both against over him after

441
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:52,200
getting hurt.

442
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,501
Uh,

443
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:54,810
even for doom after his leg injury,

444
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,380
but then they'll,

445
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,213
yeah.

446
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:56,401
Oh,

447
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:56,760
sorry.

448
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,090
Yeah,

449
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:57,840
you're right.

450
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,740
The dos Anjos fight.

451
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:58,911
Yeah.

452
00:10:58,911 --> 00:11:03,300
He's till Santos had kicked his leg
pretty hard and giant swelling on his leg.

453
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,163
Yeah.

454
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,420
Then to come back and just knock them out.

455
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,810
The way that he did was just beautiful.

456
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,890
Yeah.

457
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,181
This is,

458
00:11:08,181 --> 00:11:09,090
even if he gets hurt,

459
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,770
if he doesn't get put out and he's hurt,

460
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:11,490
he can still,

461
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,220
you can still turn on that killer
instinct and put them away.

462
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,860
So yeah,

463
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,610
it's going to be exciting.

464
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,500
Like watching this fight,

465
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:17,521
I'm amped for it.

466
00:11:17,521 --> 00:11:21,620
This is one of the big heavyweight fights
recently that I'm just so stoked for.

467
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:22,261
Yeah.

468
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:23,100
That's the big one.

469
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,290
I think it's probably the
biggest heavyweight fight ever.

470
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,520
When you think about what and gone,

471
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:27,354
who is,

472
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:27,751
you know,

473
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:28,140
I mean,

474
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:33,140
there's obviously been some giant fights
like Brock Lesnar when he fought Cain

475
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:33,151
Velasquez.

476
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,620
Barack was there when he fought over him.

477
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:35,610
Those were huge fights.

478
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,170
But I think that in Ghana knew something
special and if Steve Bay could figure

479
00:11:40,171 --> 00:11:41,790
out how to turn him down,

480
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,190
how to shut him down and beat him.

481
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,180
I mean it will really cement his position
as the baddest man on the planet.

482
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,133
And if not,

483
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,430
we got a new king.

484
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,473
Yeah.

485
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:51,720
Yeah.

486
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,410
I mean it's,

487
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,200
it's really,

488
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,070
I was even thinking

489
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,660
when you're saying those last fights,

490
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,230
uh,

491
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,440
this one I'm as excited for,

492
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,940
whereas whenever Brock fought chink,

493
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:03,840
Carwyn helping me and Brendan both were
helping chain train for that fight and

494
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,550
now I might be involved for a week or so.

495
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,920
I'm helping Steve Bay
get ready for this one.

496
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:10,020
Just being around that scene,

497
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,691
the preparations,

498
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:11,524
what they're going to do.

499
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,490
Um,

500
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,220
even just being a training partner for
that legendary fight would be pretty

501
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:15,890
epic.

502
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,940
Are you going to shave lightening
bolts in your head to emulate in Ghana?

503
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,540
Um,

504
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:19,691
I,

505
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:23,560
I'm at least going to die black
lightening bolts in my hair.

506
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:24,701
Just be the reverse.

507
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:28,360
The Vanilla Gorilla version that'd
be trained to Steve Bay before.

508
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:28,840
I haven't,

509
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,370
I haven't just talked
to his coach is a bit,

510
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,400
so they thought it'd be a great
idea and I think it is too.

511
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:35,320
So He's out there in Cleveland,

512
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:35,710
I'm sure.

513
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:35,891
I mean,

514
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:38,680
he's got some incredible team around him.

515
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,050
And you're in Oklahoma City
now in Oklahoma City with,

516
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,250
yeah.

517
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,083
That's awesome.

518
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,410
And he's killing it out there.

519
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,303
Oh my gosh.

520
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:45,390
It,

521
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,490
well he's undefeated seven
to know strangling people.

522
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,120
Gosh,

523
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,200
and knocking people out too,

524
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,280
which is crazy.

525
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,120
He started boxing or at least a
kickboxing before he ever started Jujitsu.

526
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,580
So as a kid is his father and him,

527
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,120
I don't know if you know what they're
the first ever American father,

528
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:01,481
son,

529
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,850
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belts and um,

530
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,270
man,

531
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,240
but they have this background
of just everything.

532
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,133
That's awesome.

533
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:11,500
Since like early nineties
just go in and cross training.

534
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,530
He's from that old school.

535
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,490
Like he goes like Hixon Gracie solid,

536
00:13:17,491 --> 00:13:18,020
he barrow,

537
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,810
Shawn g and then you know,

538
00:13:19,811 --> 00:13:21,670
he's in that group of those,

539
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,260
that style of Jitsu.

540
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,330
Jujitsu is just smush style.

541
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,260
Those guys have just
tremendous pressure basics.

542
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,640
And when I say basics,

543
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:35,641
I mean like the hard polished tried
and true techniques and it's like,

544
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,530
there's not like a lot of fancy,

545
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:40,060
crazy new school stuff,

546
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:45,061
but it's just laser sharp and just
smashing hour and the pressure,

547
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:49,000
such a big fan of like he's always talking
about the pressure passing and just

548
00:13:49,001 --> 00:13:50,530
melting into,

549
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,740
into him being a wet hot
blanket on top of them.

550
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,880
Just taking their airway,

551
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,110
making them give up.

552
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:56,800
And Man,

553
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,161
honestly,

554
00:13:57,161 --> 00:14:02,161
I've trained with guys like Carwyn and
mirror and couture and Overeem and I've

555
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:07,381
trained with some of the biggest heavy
weights around and he is the only person

556
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,100
and he fights at want 85.

557
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:09,701
He's the biggest one.

558
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:10,660
He five or I've ever seen,

559
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:12,640
I can't imagine that,

560
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,030
uh,

561
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,110
I don't know how he makes that cut,

562
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:14,591
but he does it.

563
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:15,424
So,

564
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:15,611
uh,

565
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:17,800
in such incredible ways that the
healthiest guy I've ever met,

566
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:21,970
most disciplined Athlete
d most disciplined person
I've ever been around in my

567
00:14:21,971 --> 00:14:22,780
entire life,

568
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,240
obsessed with discipline and training,

569
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:25,751
the,

570
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:28,210
the performance mindset
or competitive mindset,

571
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,001
the guys,

572
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,760
the the best I've ever been around.

573
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:35,440
But he is the only person to ever make
me completely claustrophobic underneath.

574
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:39,520
I've never been claustrophobic
underneath anyone and he just takes my,

575
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,261
not in a weird way,

576
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:44,610
but he takes my breath away and yeah,

577
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,180
but I mean just,

578
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,470
he,

579
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,980
he makes you want to quit.

580
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:48,320
He,

581
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,330
he and he's so,

582
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,010
and he's always about putting yourself
in the worst position possible and

583
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:54,830
becoming uncomfortable
or being comfortable,

584
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:58,460
being uncomfortable and just making
yourself to where no matter where you get

585
00:14:58,461 --> 00:14:59,030
Putt,

586
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,320
like you're going to find out of it,

587
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:03,110
you're always just one
step away from a finish.

588
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,340
Like you finishing them.

589
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:05,600
Even if they are about to finish you,

590
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:05,991
you're,

591
00:15:05,991 --> 00:15:06,410
you're just,

592
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,940
you're just a few small steps,

593
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:10,130
just inches away from
getting out of there,

594
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,023
reversing it,

595
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,080
taking their back,

596
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,441
you know,

597
00:15:12,441 --> 00:15:15,110
putting them on their back and
mounting and just finishing and,

598
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,003
and he's,

599
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,880
he's incredible.

600
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:20,600
He's the only guy that I've ever seen
be able to go through like 10 10 minute

601
00:15:20,601 --> 00:15:22,460
rounds or sorry,

602
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,480
ten eight minute rounds back to back
when he was training for the ADCCs.

603
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:25,820
Why,

604
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,590
I mean he's just an animal and no,

605
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:27,831
10,

606
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:28,550
tens,

607
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,150
it was 10 tens and I was just
blown away that he could do that.

608
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,280
And we were having to
rotate fresh guys on them.

609
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,780
And by the end of it,

610
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:36,620
he got tired of it.

611
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:39,620
But that was the only time I've ever
seen him tired but actually tired.

612
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,080
And so he's just an absolute animal.

613
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:43,370
It's a lifestyle for him.

614
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,180
It's honestly so incredibly inspiring.

615
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:51,200
And I feel like just being around them
and me doing a lot of the same things

616
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,780
that that's what's going to make
me the Bellator heavyweight champ.

617
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,000
But like just us feeding off each other.

618
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:57,620
It's really cool dynamic.

619
00:15:57,621 --> 00:16:00,020
But if I can be half as
disciplined as he is,

620
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,600
I'll be the most disciplined
heavyweight fighter there is.

621
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,260
Um,

622
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,011
so it's,

623
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:04,461
it's,

624
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:08,180
it's pretty amazing being around him
and his mindset and how he travels the

625
00:16:08,181 --> 00:16:08,541
world,

626
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:09,920
seeking out the,

627
00:16:09,921 --> 00:16:10,580
um,

628
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,370
the top instructors in every discipline.

629
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:13,731
I mean,

630
00:16:13,731 --> 00:16:15,380
he's going down to Brazil to,

631
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:16,210
um,

632
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,043
evil,

633
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,451
evil,

634
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:17,691
Osa,

635
00:16:17,691 --> 00:16:18,230
tie,

636
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,580
a bow tie.

637
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,270
Um,

638
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,110
that used to be,

639
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,030
it's kind of like intro to box,

640
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:23,211
right?

641
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:23,480
Yeah,

642
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:23,661
yeah.

643
00:16:23,661 --> 00:16:25,400
It used to be shooting boxing
and he goes in Cartiva,

644
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:25,820
right?

645
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,100
Yup.

646
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:31,070
Curitiba and goes and soaks up those good
vibes at the largest waterfall in the

647
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:31,904
world or one of them.

648
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,140
And then it's just in training camp
as these guys Portuguese he does,

649
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,810
he got a lot of people
mistake home as Brazilian,

650
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,960
but his family Spanish and he grew up in
Oklahoma City so there's not resilient

651
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:45,460
and nobody speaks fluent
Portuguese to learn.

652
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:46,230
Uh,

653
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,450
I think through Jujitsu,

654
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,560
Jujitsu,

655
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,650
being around people always trying
to put himself in those situations.

656
00:16:51,651 --> 00:16:52,640
And then he would go down,

657
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:55,220
I think it was a 16 year old kid
and he would go down to Brazil,

658
00:16:55,221 --> 00:16:58,730
sometimes by himself and stay for like
a month or two or think you might have

659
00:16:58,731 --> 00:17:00,740
done it a foot for four
months at one time.

660
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:01,310
Wow.

661
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,060
Um,

662
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,990
so he's a really,

663
00:17:02,991 --> 00:17:04,610
really special individual.

664
00:17:04,611 --> 00:17:05,450
He's the guy that I've,

665
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,830
I've never seen take,

666
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,090
take a break or take off.

667
00:17:08,091 --> 00:17:09,590
I mean he competed,

668
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,690
he fought three times and Bella this year,

669
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,141
three,

670
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:12,790
no,

671
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,700
I'm in between that.

672
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:15,450
He had a super fight with blue Chechnya.

673
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,210
He had another grappling tournament.

674
00:17:17,211 --> 00:17:20,060
He had the ADCCs you're just
going from every two months.

675
00:17:20,061 --> 00:17:22,010
He was competing every two months,

676
00:17:22,011 --> 00:17:23,780
but he was staying healthy
the whole time too,

677
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,450
which blew my mind because he takes us,

678
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,630
we have a place called the arc that we
train the athlete recovery center and

679
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:34,631
it's got hot and cold plunges and infrared
saunas in the cryotherapy and the uh,

680
00:17:35,361 --> 00:17:36,320
just all sorts of stuff.

681
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:40,540
Those NormaTec boots and our pts there
and our strength conditioning coaches

682
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:40,941
right there.

683
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:42,140
So it's all in one shop.

684
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,270
And so right after he's done training,

685
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,820
he's recovering where he gets there
early and he's stretching out.

686
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,540
And so the whole warming up truly and
cooling down and taking care of your body

687
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,980
and putting the right fuel in it,

688
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,810
eating whole foods at all times,

689
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:56,850
like just not putting
garbage in your body,

690
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:58,140
man.

691
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,973
He's going to be,

692
00:17:59,030 --> 00:17:59,410
uh,

693
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,243
the Bella tour,

694
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,950
a middle weight champion.

695
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:02,340
Um,

696
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,180
probably pretty soon.

697
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:05,910
I think they have that maybe lined
up in the next two or three fights.

698
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,840
I'm excited.

699
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,020
I'm excited to see him compete against
like really upper echelon guys.

700
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:12,480
Like guys like new
saucy along those lines.

701
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:12,930
Yeah.

702
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:13,710
The guy who just fought.

703
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,520
Um,

704
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,320
Chris Hani cut was in the NCAA finals.

705
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,450
That was the first high level
wrestler these competed against.

706
00:18:18,451 --> 00:18:19,440
He won every single round.

707
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,040
Um,

708
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,791
the first six fights,

709
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:21,660
he finished everybody.

710
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:22,650
Um,

711
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,280
and so it's going to be exciting if,

712
00:18:24,281 --> 00:18:24,431
if,

713
00:18:24,431 --> 00:18:25,770
if there's someone
watching this that hasn't,

714
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,090
you know,

715
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,410
watched Rafael Lovato junior compete,

716
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:29,970
whether it's in grappling or MMA,

717
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:31,710
like go follow him because he's,

718
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,300
he's going to do it and
he's going to be a champ.

719
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:33,810
Yeah,

720
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:34,980
he's a savage for sure.

721
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,330
What does he weigh before he makes the
cut 25 so I don't want to put a specific

722
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:39,521
number,

723
00:18:39,521 --> 00:18:42,450
but I think it's around
two 10 to 15 to 20,

724
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:43,284
something like that.

725
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,010
Um,

726
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:49,010
so I know whenever he's in camp he's
trying to walk around at a less than 200

727
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:50,311
when he can.

728
00:18:50,311 --> 00:18:51,031
And he's about like what,

729
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:51,950
six to now?

730
00:18:51,951 --> 00:18:52,411
He's six,

731
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:52,800
four,

732
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,061
six,

733
00:18:53,061 --> 00:18:53,260
four,

734
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:53,440
six,

735
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,380
four and he's kind of like
some of the longest reach.

736
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,490
Yeah,

737
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,810
he's at least in 25.

738
00:18:57,811 --> 00:18:58,830
That's crazy.

739
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:02,880
I think it's probably a
size 1314 is Instagram.

740
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,890
And you could see a picture
of him with his shirt off.

741
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,940
Homeboy is fucking shredded red man.

742
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:08,431
He's,

743
00:19:08,431 --> 00:19:08,820
he's,

744
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,700
he's gotta be in the neighborhood
of like eight or 9% body fat.

745
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,530
Yeah.

746
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,363
Zero.

747
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,520
But there's just shredded,

748
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,570
just as a heavyweight.

749
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:21,240
I've always just envied anyone
that was under 15 or whatever.

750
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,660
So I mean,

751
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,850
come on son.

752
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,540
Yeah,

753
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:24,750
sure.

754
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,583
Shredded.

755
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:25,951
And,

756
00:19:25,951 --> 00:19:26,430
uh,

757
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,540
and he looks down at every,

758
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,410
every,

759
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,400
every guy has ever fought.

760
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:29,970
I mean,

761
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,290
if you see other way in photos,

762
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,460
like they're all looking up at him,

763
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:35,910
like literally their chins up in the
shore and he went through a pretty

764
00:19:35,911 --> 00:19:37,560
significant injury a few years back.

765
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:37,741
Right.

766
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:39,060
Didn't you have like a peck tears?

767
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:39,450
Yeah,

768
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,283
I think it was the,

769
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,560
is there a peck tendon
or something like that?

770
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,350
I think was the tendon in there that
connects like the shoulder and the Pec and

771
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,170
completely tore it and had
to have reconstructive,

772
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:49,590
uh,

773
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,423
surgery.

774
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,840
And Man,

775
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:53,310
the guy's so discipline.

776
00:19:53,311 --> 00:19:53,520
I mean,

777
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:53,701
I mean,

778
00:19:53,701 --> 00:19:55,140
he went through like anyone,

779
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,340
all of us athletes would,

780
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,210
um,

781
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,290
being bummed out a bit.

782
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:58,891
But,

783
00:19:58,891 --> 00:19:59,220
uh,

784
00:19:59,220 --> 00:19:59,491
you know,

785
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:00,750
he had this machine that was,

786
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:01,200
you know,

787
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,940
moving his arm up and down and,

788
00:20:02,941 --> 00:20:03,181
you know,

789
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:04,110
just sitting there.

790
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:04,680
Um,

791
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,570
but then the guy is a planner,

792
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:07,530
a visualizer.

793
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,650
Like he takes advantage even
the times he's not on the mat.

794
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,590
He's structuring his life around it,

795
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:16,110
towards writing down his
goals and his dreams.

796
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,580
And this month's plan,

797
00:20:17,581 --> 00:20:18,990
the next three months plan,

798
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:19,650
uh,

799
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:20,730
this week's plan,

800
00:20:20,731 --> 00:20:21,870
this day's plan.

801
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:26,250
I'm just writing every single thing out
so that way he can make sure that he's

802
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:26,911
doing everything.

803
00:20:26,911 --> 00:20:28,110
Can't even when he's not training,

804
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:28,850
he's,

805
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,520
he's training,

806
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:29,661
you know,

807
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:30,391
he's trained his mind,

808
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:33,390
he's training a everything
for that so that he can,

809
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,830
he can perform at the best.

810
00:20:34,831 --> 00:20:37,260
And I think that's why he
competes at such a high level.

811
00:20:37,261 --> 00:20:37,650
And I'm,

812
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,940
I'm speaking about him like this,

813
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,380
but it's all true.

814
00:20:40,381 --> 00:20:40,921
It's all honest.

815
00:20:40,921 --> 00:20:42,740
I'm not just trying to give the guy props,

816
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,880
like he earned that from me at least.

817
00:20:44,881 --> 00:20:48,010
And I think you should from pretty
much anyone who competes with because

818
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,213
um,

819
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,451
man,

820
00:20:49,451 --> 00:20:53,290
I mean his match with boot Chacha even
was so competitive and could have easily

821
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,124
won that match.

822
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:54,460
I mean,

823
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,930
he could warm the ADCCs.

824
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,441
I mean,

825
00:20:56,441 --> 00:20:58,420
easily he attaches a big fellow too.

826
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:58,661
Yeah,

827
00:20:58,661 --> 00:20:59,050
I know.

828
00:20:59,050 --> 00:20:59,690
Like two,

829
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:03,690
two 45 of just hike just
and then worldclass.

830
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,200
Yeah.

831
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,720
Oh yeah.

832
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,840
I mean one the ADC.

833
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,050
I think for now a big Lavato Fan,

834
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:08,884
I think he's awesome.

835
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:09,410
Yeah,

836
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,360
I'm excited to see,

837
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:15,220
I always love when the really the highest
level guys in any discipline enter

838
00:21:15,221 --> 00:21:16,054
into MMA,

839
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,601
you know?

840
00:21:16,601 --> 00:21:18,250
And when you see a guy like cam was just,

841
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:18,710
uh,

842
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,400
just ginger Jujitsu
phenom and now he's like,

843
00:21:21,401 --> 00:21:21,611
okay,

844
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:26,110
now I'm going to try to take over MMA or
a guy like go con Saki enters into the

845
00:21:26,111 --> 00:21:26,501
UFC.

846
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:26,680
Like,

847
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:26,891
oh,

848
00:21:26,891 --> 00:21:27,161
okay,

849
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:30,820
let's see what happens when you get like
a real high level guy in any discipline

850
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:32,920
who enters into MMA.

851
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,560
It's always interesting because
there's such specialists,

852
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,240
because most MMA fighters,

853
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:37,990
you know,

854
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,130
pretty good at wrestling,

855
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,120
pretty good at Jujitsu,

856
00:21:40,121 --> 00:21:41,380
pretty good at kickboxing,

857
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,910
but not elite like world class world
championship level at any different

858
00:21:45,911 --> 00:21:46,744
discipline.

859
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:51,120
So when you see a guy who is like Rafael
Lovato is world class that you just see

860
00:21:51,121 --> 00:21:54,040
like world championship level
and then enters into MMA,

861
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:54,340
it's like,

862
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,030
Ooh,

863
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:55,841
what you're going to do.

864
00:21:55,841 --> 00:21:56,740
And he grabbed you.

865
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,180
Yeah,

866
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:57,761
absolutely.

867
00:21:57,761 --> 00:22:02,140
Like daily in my world who
Rafael is and seeing or for doom.

868
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,550
Yeah,

869
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:02,880
yeah,

870
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,160
yeah,

871
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,910
absolutely.

872
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,640
And something special about
Raphael again and then,

873
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,361
but anyways,

874
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:08,194
he's a,

875
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,480
he can coach it so incredibly well too.

876
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,390
And that's not always the
case with a lot of athletes.

877
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:15,400
I've been coached by a lot
of incredible wrestlers.

878
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,300
Um,

879
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,020
Kenny Monday,

880
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,561
Kendall Cross,

881
00:22:17,561 --> 00:22:18,670
they were incredible coaches.

882
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:19,570
Cael Sanderson.

883
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:20,111
Um,

884
00:22:20,111 --> 00:22:22,630
I've been coached on the maths
by Dan Gable and some other guys.

885
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,141
Um,

886
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:28,141
so absolute legends and his coaching
is also just so thorough and so exact.

887
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,411
And it's,

888
00:22:29,411 --> 00:22:33,520
it's like you see the guy
at the top right now who's,

889
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:38,550
who's performing at the best and he's
able to teach it at such a high level that

890
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,330
that's why he's,

891
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:39,610
you know,

892
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:42,190
coached up some other grappling
world champions and stuff like that.

893
00:22:42,191 --> 00:22:43,480
And it's focuses on MMA.

894
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:47,440
He's just perfect timing the him and I
got to train together for a full year now

895
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,900
and taking it in 2018
both of us want to be,

896
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,471
you know,

897
00:22:50,471 --> 00:22:51,460
hunting down those belts.

898
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,700
Did you move down to Oklahoma City
specifically to train with him?

899
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:55,810
There was a few reasons.

900
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,140
Um,

901
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:56,591
but yeah,

902
00:22:56,591 --> 00:22:56,951
that was,

903
00:22:56,951 --> 00:23:01,840
that was one of the big ones I was going
to regardless because water is based

904
00:23:01,841 --> 00:23:04,450
out of there and fight for the
forgotten is underneath water for.

905
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:05,050
And so we're,

906
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,020
we're partners with him,

907
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:06,760
um,

908
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,790
and they've taken over all
the administrative stuff
and we're officially an

909
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:10,980
initiative underwater for,

910
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,710
it's nice.

911
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:11,951
Yeah.

912
00:23:11,951 --> 00:23:12,850
I mean it's the,

913
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:13,251
it's,

914
00:23:13,251 --> 00:23:13,990
it's incredible.

915
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:14,320
Um,

916
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:14,890
so,

917
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:15,211
so,

918
00:23:15,211 --> 00:23:16,320
so stoked that they're,

919
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,430
they're making things just flourish.

920
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:20,980
We're going to serve over 200,000
people with clean water this year.

921
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,090
That's so incredible.

922
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,720
And we're doing a benefit tonight at
the comedy store and it's going to be

923
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:26,381
incredible.

924
00:23:26,381 --> 00:23:27,490
The prompt one of many.

925
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:29,380
I think we're going to start
doing these all the time there.

926
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,071
I just think,

927
00:23:30,071 --> 00:23:33,760
and we do shows there all the time and
most of the time we just do shows and I'm

928
00:23:33,761 --> 00:23:33,911
like,

929
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:34,031
well,

930
00:23:34,031 --> 00:23:35,240
why shouldn't we just do shows?

931
00:23:35,241 --> 00:23:37,780
And like couple times a month or so,

932
00:23:37,781 --> 00:23:39,280
just donate all the money.

933
00:23:39,281 --> 00:23:40,450
So that's what we're going to do,

934
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:41,020
man.

935
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,340
I'm blown away by it.

936
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,263
So stoked.

937
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,080
Um,

938
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,280
well I found out right before

939
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:49,700
we got on the podcast that there's a
generous donor out of Oklahoma City.

940
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,930
Um,

941
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,910
and he's going to match whatever comes in,

942
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:53,421
uh,

943
00:23:53,421 --> 00:23:54,070
today,

944
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:54,270
uh,

945
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,011
on the website,

946
00:23:55,011 --> 00:23:58,640
whether that's at the comedy
store now I'm up to $10,000.

947
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,890
So the first $10,000 will be matched.

948
00:24:00,891 --> 00:24:03,140
And so that first 10,000 will be doubled,

949
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:04,430
will turn into 20,000.

950
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:05,031
Um,

951
00:24:05,031 --> 00:24:05,930
so just so stoked.

952
00:24:05,931 --> 00:24:07,580
So whatever comes in through the doors,

953
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,230
uh,

954
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:08,660
man,

955
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,610
it can be doubled it.

956
00:24:09,611 --> 00:24:10,221
That's beautiful,

957
00:24:10,221 --> 00:24:10,510
man.

958
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:10,850
Yeah.

959
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:11,061
Yeah.

960
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:11,360
Well,

961
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:11,631
you know,

962
00:24:11,631 --> 00:24:14,300
like a first time we did this,

963
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:19,640
we got bitcoin from people
and they donated bitcoin.

964
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,940
And I have that bitcoin on my phone
and I have to get it off the phone.

965
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:28,010
But that big coin is now worth like
$50,000 so what I did was I took that

966
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,873
Bitcoin,

967
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,330
I took the cash version of it and I
don't need to water four and then I'm Mac

968
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:34,790
matched it and now we're up to,

969
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,850
so all that additional money is yours too.

970
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:38,983
Like it's not mine,

971
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,000
it's yours.

972
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,670
So it's like there's an
additional $45,000 in there.

973
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:44,260
Yeah.

974
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,240
So we got to get it off,

975
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,281
get it off the phone,

976
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:47,890
but that'll go to waterfall as well.

977
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,500
Man,

978
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,160
I can't,

979
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,120
this isn't fake.

980
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,530
I can't pick this kind of smell.

981
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:52,790
Awesome man.

982
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,061
Yeah.

983
00:24:53,061 --> 00:24:53,690
And it's,

984
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:57,060
the thing is that was trade in there for
a while because if you keep it in there

985
00:24:57,061 --> 00:24:58,730
with for a while might be worth even more.

986
00:24:58,731 --> 00:24:59,481
Do you bail now?

987
00:24:59,481 --> 00:24:59,800
What do you

988
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
it might go way up.

989
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,480
Oh well then we can keep blaming.

990
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:02,920
Wait,

991
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,620
wait up.

992
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,310
Like how way?

993
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:09,310
Like speculation in the next six to 12
months is at least 20,000 if not 50,000.

994
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,330
Whoa.

995
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,920
That's like way high speculation.

996
00:25:12,921 --> 00:25:13,460
I'm not,

997
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,293
oh my God.

998
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,680
Oh that's what I'll do.

999
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,240
I'll leave it up to you guys.

1000
00:25:17,241 --> 00:25:18,100
We'll get the

1001
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,910
bitcoin off the phone and
then I'll essentially leave
it up to you guys when you

1002
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:24,460
want to pull the trigger and
take the money out of it.

1003
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:25,370
Okay.

1004
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,530
Because that seems to be the right cause.

1005
00:25:26,531 --> 00:25:26,770
Like,

1006
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:27,131
well let's,

1007
00:25:27,131 --> 00:25:29,770
let's first I thought advisors to tell us,

1008
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,161
you know what,

1009
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:31,960
I'm going to get Andrea's Antonopoulos,

1010
00:25:31,961 --> 00:25:35,580
he's going to be on the podcast soon
and he's the guy who set up all this big

1011
00:25:35,581 --> 00:25:37,120
coin stuff for me in the first place.

1012
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,020
Um,

1013
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,480
the big coins all came in as donations.

1014
00:25:40,481 --> 00:25:42,040
So just so everybody knows,

1015
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:42,430
like,

1016
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:46,390
cause some people accused me of
not donating that money to you.

1017
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:47,680
And I had explained to them,

1018
00:25:47,681 --> 00:25:48,011
no,

1019
00:25:48,011 --> 00:25:50,140
I took the big coin and I just,

1020
00:25:50,141 --> 00:25:51,820
whatever the money value of it was,

1021
00:25:51,821 --> 00:25:53,110
then I gave that to you guys.

1022
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,190
So,

1023
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,023
but I remember that.

1024
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:55,541
But the,

1025
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:56,620
what's left,

1026
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:57,761
I still,

1027
00:25:57,761 --> 00:25:58,720
it's not mine.

1028
00:25:59,230 --> 00:25:59,650
It's,

1029
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:00,190
it's,

1030
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:00,790
you know,

1031
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,770
just because I gave,

1032
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,561
I mean I have it,

1033
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,161
but it's not mine.

1034
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:03,910
It's yours.

1035
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,650
So it's all donation.

1036
00:26:05,651 --> 00:26:06,484
That's just,

1037
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,500
I thought as a science project,

1038
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:08,861
I'm like,

1039
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:10,240
let's just see what
happens when they shit,

1040
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:11,260
I don't want to take it out.

1041
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,213
It could have been zero,

1042
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,260
worthless.

1043
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,530
Want to turn it into money.

1044
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,000
I didn't want to cash it out.

1045
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:16,541
So I said,

1046
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:20,380
let me just give you guys whatever
money it is and I'll hold on to that and

1047
00:26:20,381 --> 00:26:21,340
they'll see what happens with it.

1048
00:26:21,341 --> 00:26:22,690
But now it's worth 50 grand.

1049
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,020
Wow.

1050
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,621
That's nuts.

1051
00:26:23,621 --> 00:26:24,090
So yeah,

1052
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:24,531
more than that.

1053
00:26:24,531 --> 00:26:25,920
Six 65 oh Jesus.

1054
00:26:25,921 --> 00:26:26,101
Yeah.

1055
00:26:26,101 --> 00:26:26,761
It keeps going up.

1056
00:26:26,761 --> 00:26:28,560
It's quick on a crazy spike right now.

1057
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,170
Wow.

1058
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,990
That was worth $13,000 holy shit.

1059
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,690
Whoa,

1060
00:26:33,691 --> 00:26:34,524
that's,

1061
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,950
that's crazy.

1062
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:41,250
And I will also put out my bitcoin address
once I get it off the phone for you

1063
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,531
guys,

1064
00:26:43,531 --> 00:26:43,980
if you want to

1065
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,491
donate money,

1066
00:26:44,491 --> 00:26:44,880
and again,

1067
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,713
all of that money,

1068
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,560
none of it goes to me.

1069
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:47,610
It's all going to go to water.

1070
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:49,530
Four it's all going to go
to fight for the forgotten,

1071
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:54,150
which is the shirt that I'm wearing and
that's what the benefit is tonight at

1072
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:54,900
the comedy store.

1073
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,900
All the money is going to fight for the
forgotten and you can donate to at what

1074
00:27:00,481 --> 00:27:00,951
is the website,

1075
00:27:00,951 --> 00:27:01,050
right.

1076
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:06,050
Fight for the forgotten.org/donate and
if you guys haven't paid attention any

1077
00:27:06,361 --> 00:27:08,010
Justin's podcasts before,

1078
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,390
I'll give you a brief run down.

1079
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,940
Justin was on the ultimate fighter,

1080
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:17,630
fought for the UFC for a while and then
found his true calling going to the

1081
00:27:17,731 --> 00:27:22,731
Congo and building wells for the
pygmies and it's just an amazing story.

1082
00:27:22,831 --> 00:27:24,510
You could watch some of the podcasts,

1083
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:28,260
you can watch some of the short clips on
you and I know there's a documentary on

1084
00:27:28,261 --> 00:27:29,850
you that's coming out soon as well.

1085
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,181
Yeah,

1086
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,600
I think he's going to be the summer of uh,

1087
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,590
2018 and so thank you so much for even
doing a sit down interview on that.

1088
00:27:35,591 --> 00:27:36,151
And my pleasure,

1089
00:27:36,151 --> 00:27:36,671
my pleasure.

1090
00:27:36,671 --> 00:27:38,400
And had a whole lot of
value to the film and,

1091
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:43,670
and just give it a louder voice or a wider
reach because my first promise to the

1092
00:27:44,281 --> 00:27:44,581
pygmies,

1093
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:45,414
and this was even,

1094
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,020
um,

1095
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,831
so man,

1096
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:50,100
I'm just so thankful for the support
of this community and personally you,

1097
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:50,660
uh,

1098
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,720
because man,

1099
00:27:51,721 --> 00:27:52,501
when I first came on,

1100
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:53,670
we haven't drilled any wells.

1101
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,181
In fact,

1102
00:27:54,181 --> 00:27:55,190
I had just had Andy,

1103
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:56,470
um,

1104
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,020
you know,

1105
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:01,020
I had held him and he's an old and a half
year old boy that I held has he passed

1106
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:01,920
away and uh,

1107
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,031
and it wrecked me.

1108
00:28:03,031 --> 00:28:03,990
It changed me and it,

1109
00:28:03,991 --> 00:28:05,970
but I knew we were going
to do something with water.

1110
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,043
I just knew it.

1111
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,650
Um,

1112
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,930
but my first time on the podcast
there were zero wells drilled.

1113
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:12,450
I was just going to go there and live
for a year and hopefully we were going to

1114
00:28:12,451 --> 00:28:13,620
build an incredible team.

1115
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,660
That team is now 20 strong,

1116
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,740
a fulltime,

1117
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,790
12 part time,

1118
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:18,570
um,

1119
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,970
been able to drill 70 water wells now.

1120
00:28:20,971 --> 00:28:21,511
It's amazing.

1121
00:28:21,511 --> 00:28:23,520
70 communities have been transformed.

1122
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:23,940
Um,

1123
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,100
if that bitcoin is 50 grand,

1124
00:28:26,101 --> 00:28:28,440
I mean 4,265 he said,

1125
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:29,821
oh my gosh,

1126
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:30,031
well,

1127
00:28:30,031 --> 00:28:31,080
I'm not a math whiz.

1128
00:28:31,081 --> 00:28:31,351
So,

1129
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:31,880
uh,

1130
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,110
I,

1131
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:32,351
if I,

1132
00:28:32,351 --> 00:28:32,821
if we're living,

1133
00:28:32,821 --> 00:28:33,570
but um,

1134
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,780
but it's a $4,200 transforms a community.

1135
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,200
Uh,

1136
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,810
it helps our teams go out
there and survey the land.

1137
00:28:39,811 --> 00:28:43,260
We have a survey team now that gets
to go out and scout it out beforehand.

1138
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:43,950
Um,

1139
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:47,460
tell our teams what tools to bring
out and what obstacles to expect.

1140
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,031
Um,

1141
00:28:48,031 --> 00:28:50,940
so that's a few hundred
dollars for $500 to go survey.

1142
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:51,481
Um,

1143
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:53,670
then to drill the wells around $2,700,

1144
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,490
and then to help the community
and really teach and train them.

1145
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:59,700
So we educate the locals with the
knowledge on how to drill the wells.

1146
00:28:59,701 --> 00:29:01,590
We equip them with the
tools to be able to do it.

1147
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,340
Um,

1148
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,420
how many of them can read?

1149
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,401
So a,

1150
00:29:05,401 --> 00:29:06,630
of our well drillers,

1151
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,493
everyone,

1152
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:07,771
well,

1153
00:29:07,771 --> 00:29:08,940
I think everyone can,

1154
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,270
a lot of them have even
graduated from a University of,

1155
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:12,870
uh,

1156
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,340
with community development degrees.

1157
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:14,520
Uh,

1158
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,950
I mean the people that
live in the community,

1159
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,793
pygmies,

1160
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,980
the Mu boothy pygmies,

1161
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:18,863
none of them.

1162
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,760
I've met two people,

1163
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:21,990
I think two,

1164
00:29:21,991 --> 00:29:24,810
maybe three that can
actually read a in there,

1165
00:29:24,811 --> 00:29:25,450
the chiefs.

1166
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:25,701
Um,

1167
00:29:25,701 --> 00:29:27,240
one of them is actually an incredible guy,

1168
00:29:27,241 --> 00:29:29,390
chief Alondo grandsons,

1169
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:29,851
Jimmy,

1170
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:30,790
and he's going to be chief one day.

1171
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,610
That's like my favorite
little guy over there.

1172
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:33,540
Um,

1173
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,280
and Gypsy's in school now.

1174
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:35,671
And,

1175
00:29:35,671 --> 00:29:36,330
uh,

1176
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,440
there's a long story with that,

1177
00:29:37,441 --> 00:29:37,730
but it's,

1178
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,540
it's one of the first
times ever them a booty.

1179
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,950
Pygmies I've ever been in school,

1180
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:41,171
uh,

1181
00:29:41,171 --> 00:29:45,070
and sustainably to where they can even
pay their school fees and they can have

1182
00:29:45,071 --> 00:29:47,320
food there because they can buy the food.

1183
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:47,970
Um,

1184
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:48,700
and so,

1185
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,560
but traditionally they don't
have a written language.

1186
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,040
Um,

1187
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,090
they don't have a calendar,

1188
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,380
so they don't know their age.

1189
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:53,920
Um,

1190
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,910
and so they're really,

1191
00:29:54,911 --> 00:29:57,250
really traditional
hunter gatherer society.

1192
00:29:57,251 --> 00:29:58,540
That's just a incredible,

1193
00:29:58,541 --> 00:29:59,220
you'd love them there.

1194
00:29:59,220 --> 00:29:59,590
You know,

1195
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,460
with the Bose,

1196
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:01,000
they're,

1197
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,833
they're deadly.

1198
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:02,950
I've seen a little boy,

1199
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,310
uh,

1200
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,121
probably eight,

1201
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:04,421
nine,

1202
00:30:04,421 --> 00:30:05,254
10 years old.

1203
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:05,830
Um,

1204
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,450
climb up.

1205
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,283
Uh,

1206
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,890
the canopy of the rain forest is probably,

1207
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:10,030
it's well over a hundred feet.

1208
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,200
It's probably 150,

1209
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:12,034
200 feet.

1210
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:12,501
Um,

1211
00:30:12,501 --> 00:30:14,020
and senior guys shimmy up there,

1212
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:14,561
eight,

1213
00:30:14,561 --> 00:30:14,861
nine,

1214
00:30:14,861 --> 00:30:17,370
10 years old to the top and a,

1215
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,140
it was a guy with a bow on
is like hung around his neck.

1216
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:20,800
Um,

1217
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,740
and so he goes up there
and then he's sniping,

1218
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:24,021
you know,

1219
00:30:24,021 --> 00:30:24,880
parents or,

1220
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,140
or other kinds of birds,

1221
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,053
parrots,

1222
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,150
anything they can find,

1223
00:30:28,151 --> 00:30:28,390
man.

1224
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,240
So I,

1225
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:30,880
one thing that they do,

1226
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:32,140
I don't know why this popped in my mind,

1227
00:30:32,141 --> 00:30:32,530
but uh,

1228
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:37,530
if they're running in their hunting
after an antelope a and a bee flies by,

1229
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:40,540
they're going to chase that
bead to the hive because,

1230
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:40,700
uh,

1231
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:40,960
they,

1232
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,760
they honey to them was like gold.

1233
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:43,541
I mean it's,

1234
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:44,020
it's,

1235
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,760
they love honey having something sweet.

1236
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,040
So they'll risk their lives
to climb up into the trees.

1237
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,960
They set a fire at the bottom of the tree,

1238
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,250
let the smoke go up,

1239
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,440
and then they climb up there
and they just reach in.

1240
00:30:53,441 --> 00:30:54,700
And these are African beads,

1241
00:30:54,701 --> 00:30:59,470
these are killer bees that
they're reaching into the
honey hive and just pulling

1242
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:01,330
it out and dropping it down in a basket.

1243
00:31:01,331 --> 00:31:02,050
We're just,

1244
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,000
we're just plopping it down.

1245
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,873
Just can't leave

1246
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,131
sometimes too.

1247
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:09,830
People go up there and the one guy's
purpose is just to have like a,

1248
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,570
a twig and leaves that he's hitting the,

1249
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:15,490
the bees off of the
guy reaching in cheese.

1250
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,720
So he's just protecting them.

1251
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,560
But then when those guys come back into
the village and they have this just

1252
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,790
treasure pot of,

1253
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:22,450
of,

1254
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,283
of honey,

1255
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,690
the whole village celebrates their heroes.

1256
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,320
Um,

1257
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:26,921
and you know,

1258
00:31:26,921 --> 00:31:29,890
cause they literally did risk
their lives for their wives,

1259
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:31,540
for the kids so that they
could have some honey.

1260
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,200
Wow.

1261
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:32,831
Then they save it,

1262
00:31:32,831 --> 00:31:33,664
they savor it.

1263
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:34,151
Uh,

1264
00:31:34,151 --> 00:31:34,601
and it's,

1265
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,080
it's,

1266
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,020
it's pretty incredible.

1267
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:38,620
Another other thing they do is if
they're on a hunt and they find a turtle,

1268
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,100
um,

1269
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:39,911
they'll actually make,

1270
00:31:39,911 --> 00:31:42,790
it looks almost like the kids here
that have like Ninja turtle backpack.

1271
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,840
They'll tie a vine around the feet of
the turtle and then they put it on their

1272
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:48,880
back and then they go back to hunting.

1273
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,020
And if they get an animal,

1274
00:31:50,021 --> 00:31:52,270
if they get like no,

1275
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,410
they just keep it alive
and it's on their back.

1276
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:58,480
And if they get a kill of an antelope
or a wild hog or something like that,

1277
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,890
they actually left the turtle go.

1278
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,330
And then if they,

1279
00:32:01,331 --> 00:32:01,980
yeah,

1280
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,240
they,

1281
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,580
they only take what they need.

1282
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,580
So they respect the
forest and its resources.

1283
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,241
Um,

1284
00:32:07,241 --> 00:32:09,340
so much so they only keep what they need.

1285
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,830
Fucking tumultuous ride
for that poor turtle.

1286
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:13,120
Yeah,

1287
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,740
you're right about that.

1288
00:32:14,741 --> 00:32:15,850
All the fuckers find a peg,

1289
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,753
but,

1290
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,203
but,

1291
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,143
but,

1292
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,171
but if they,

1293
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:23,650
if they don't and they have food and
dinner later for their kids and so they

1294
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:27,070
bring it back and they'll just cut
it open and put it on the fire and,

1295
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:27,590
uh,

1296
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,620
and have eaten turtle there.

1297
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:30,670
Um,

1298
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,900
it's not the best.

1299
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,160
It's,

1300
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,920
it's a,

1301
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,880
it's really gave me,

1302
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,140
and um,

1303
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,390
uh,

1304
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:37,841
it really,

1305
00:32:37,841 --> 00:32:39,170
really chewy the kind that I had.

1306
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:40,070
And

1307
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,970
I don't know what part I had,

1308
00:32:40,971 --> 00:32:41,271
but I've,

1309
00:32:41,271 --> 00:32:42,790
I've had even monkey there.

1310
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:43,100
Uh,

1311
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,670
th this was before I was there during
the Ebola breakout and everything.

1312
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:47,360
Um,

1313
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,691
but,

1314
00:32:47,691 --> 00:32:47,841
uh,

1315
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:50,930
I didn't know that you get it from
eating monkey and so they just,

1316
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,640
they eat monkey all the time.

1317
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,830
I've been in monkey several times now,

1318
00:32:54,831 --> 00:32:56,240
probably it probably five,

1319
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:56,481
six,

1320
00:32:56,481 --> 00:32:57,020
seven times.

1321
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,853
Wow.

1322
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,410
It's going to sound goofy,

1323
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:01,670
but it's super Tinder.

1324
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,480
Um,

1325
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,190
it was some of the best meat I've had.

1326
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:04,911
The one they gave me,

1327
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:05,930
I think it was part of like the,

1328
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,640
around the femur bone or whatever.

1329
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,170
Does it freak you out to you to prime it?

1330
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:09,830
Uh,

1331
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:14,830
it didn't know at first I thought it was
kind of crazy and then after I tasted

1332
00:33:15,111 --> 00:33:15,380
it,

1333
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:15,981
it was really,

1334
00:33:15,981 --> 00:33:16,521
really good.

1335
00:33:16,521 --> 00:33:17,720
And so after that,

1336
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,580
I mean it's,

1337
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:18,911
it's,

1338
00:33:18,911 --> 00:33:19,580
it's good.

1339
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,680
My friend Steve Rinella went to,

1340
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,533
um,

1341
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,730
where was it in South
America that he went to?

1342
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,220
I cannot remember,

1343
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:33,850
but he was a down there hunting with
this tribe and they prefer monkey over

1344
00:33:34,311 --> 00:33:35,144
everything.

1345
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:35,690
Oh Man.

1346
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:36,523
It's that good.

1347
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:36,920
Yeah.

1348
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,101
I mean,

1349
00:33:37,101 --> 00:33:38,300
that's why it's good.

1350
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:39,823
Really good.

1351
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,570
I'm not just saying that,

1352
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,230
I mean it's,

1353
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:42,951
it's really good.

1354
00:33:42,951 --> 00:33:44,060
And they celebrate whenever,

1355
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,100
whatever one Keysight as they bring back,

1356
00:33:46,101 --> 00:33:47,720
whether it's a big one or a little guy,

1357
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:48,740
they're gonna,

1358
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,150
they're gonna really celebrate
because that's some of the,

1359
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,050
they call it the sweet meat.

1360
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:52,650
So say he's at,

1361
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:54,950
yeah,

1362
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,910
they're eating monkey still.

1363
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:57,050
Does it say where he's at?

1364
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:57,650
Olivia.

1365
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:58,101
Bolivia.

1366
00:33:58,101 --> 00:33:58,934
That's it.

1367
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,241
Yeah.

1368
00:33:59,241 --> 00:34:00,074
That's a,

1369
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:03,860
I think there's even a youtube video
sometimes people can go check out on my

1370
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:04,820
youtube channel of me,

1371
00:34:04,821 --> 00:34:06,080
try and monkey for the first time.

1372
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,070
I thought they were teasing me.

1373
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,080
And so at the end I know it's,

1374
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,003
this is chicken,

1375
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,060
it's gotta be chicken.

1376
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:11,661
And they're like,

1377
00:34:11,661 --> 00:34:11,901
no,

1378
00:34:11,901 --> 00:34:12,710
it's monkey.

1379
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:13,371
And after I got off,

1380
00:34:13,371 --> 00:34:14,390
they walked me outside to,

1381
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,000
to where the monkey like carcass
was still there and everything.

1382
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:17,781
And I was like,

1383
00:34:17,781 --> 00:34:18,614
Dang,

1384
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,640
this is real.

1385
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,451
Like it's really,

1386
00:34:20,451 --> 00:34:20,691
really,

1387
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:21,470
really good.

1388
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:21,951
And I said,

1389
00:34:21,951 --> 00:34:23,150
it tastes like chicken.

1390
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:23,781
Yeah.

1391
00:34:23,781 --> 00:34:26,720
That's funny cause Rinella said it
tasted like a smoked Turkey leg.

1392
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,200
Yeah.

1393
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,100
So like the way they go,

1394
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:31,160
they cooked it over like
the meat consistent use,

1395
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:31,790
uh,

1396
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:32,930
over the fire.

1397
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,121
Yeah.

1398
00:34:34,121 --> 00:34:34,954
It's just

1399
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:37,800
some man.

1400
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,511
It's awesome.

1401
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:41,510
And we're about to get two
to 3000 more acres of land.

1402
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:42,350
No.

1403
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:42,780
Yeah,

1404
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,810
my kids coming in.

1405
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:45,711
I hope so.

1406
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:46,544
But no,

1407
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,100
I don't think I'd be a hunter
if that was all he could hunt.

1408
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:49,910
It was monk said,

1409
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:50,241
I'd be like,

1410
00:34:50,241 --> 00:34:51,800
I think I'm going Vegan.

1411
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,320
He's a vegetarian coming back here.

1412
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:57,320
You know my wife like shed a tear
I think because I ate a monkey.

1413
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,371
Yeah.

1414
00:34:58,371 --> 00:34:59,750
I mean I think she was,

1415
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,210
she was like,

1416
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:01,043
wait a what?

1417
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:05,170
So I think she still thinks I just
had one instead of five or six.

1418
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,220
One hour should know.

1419
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:06,910
Yeah,

1420
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:07,261
actually.

1421
00:35:07,261 --> 00:35:07,560
Yeah,

1422
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,470
she does know because of this.

1423
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:10,483
But um,

1424
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:10,910
man,

1425
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,121
it's,

1426
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:12,800
it's such an adventure living out there.

1427
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:17,801
And so to be able to empower the locals
to do it for themselves is just so key.

1428
00:35:18,861 --> 00:35:19,610
Like that's,

1429
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:20,121
that's,

1430
00:35:20,121 --> 00:35:22,580
I guess the message I'm
preaching is just the,

1431
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,170
is greater than charity.

1432
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,330
That's why I asked you if they could read,

1433
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:26,980
if it's like,

1434
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,813
do they,

1435
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,900
do you give them instruction manuals,

1436
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,940
how to maintain and how to,

1437
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:34,520
the upkeep for wells or
how to build a new one or,

1438
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,870
so with the pygmies,

1439
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,310
they're involved in helping
us get our equipment

1440
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:38,641
out there.

1441
00:35:38,641 --> 00:35:38,761
I mean,

1442
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:41,790
sometimes our hikes are from
the nearest quote unquote road,

1443
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:43,260
which none of us would call a road at all.

1444
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,510
And the same drive.

1445
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,870
Some of the times the drive to
the beginning of the rain forest,

1446
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:52,140
we're from the airport
is four no six hours.

1447
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:56,700
The same exact drive has
taken 24 hours or 48 hours.

1448
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,970
We had to dig out like 40 cars in front
of us one time because they were just

1449
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:00,810
stuck in the mud.

1450
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:01,450
Um,

1451
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,310
and to get around it.

1452
00:36:02,311 --> 00:36:02,491
So,

1453
00:36:02,491 --> 00:36:03,840
but once we get to the rain forest,

1454
00:36:03,841 --> 00:36:04,770
that can take an hour,

1455
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:05,791
two hours,

1456
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:07,560
three hours to hike each way.

1457
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,210
Um,

1458
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:10,800
and so a round trip to with one ton of,

1459
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:14,340
well drilling equipment is a lot
to the whole village helps us.

1460
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:14,790
I mean,

1461
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,460
there's a incredible Swahili
proverb that basically says,

1462
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,720
if you think you are,

1463
00:36:18,721 --> 00:36:19,501
if you want to go fast,

1464
00:36:19,501 --> 00:36:20,220
go alone,

1465
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,090
but if you want to go far,

1466
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:21,924
go together.

1467
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,430
And so I think it's
beautiful because they,

1468
00:36:24,431 --> 00:36:26,250
they don't even let us
do all the work alone.

1469
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:29,220
They know that there were going to
come come in there and help them with

1470
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:30,390
something that's so precious.

1471
00:36:30,391 --> 00:36:31,440
That's life saving,

1472
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,670
life giving to them.

1473
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:33,301
So,

1474
00:36:33,301 --> 00:36:34,134
uh,

1475
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:34,470
they,

1476
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:37,200
they all send a hundred people to
come help us with our equipment.

1477
00:36:37,201 --> 00:36:38,110
And so what,

1478
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,040
what used to take us days to take in,

1479
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:41,281
you know,

1480
00:36:41,281 --> 00:36:44,970
it takes us just that one trip and
so they help us get it in there.

1481
00:36:44,971 --> 00:36:45,810
They build us huts.

1482
00:36:45,811 --> 00:36:48,570
So basically they build us a
home just like what they live in.

1483
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:49,440
Um,

1484
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,400
very hospitable.

1485
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,810
Give us our food while we're there.

1486
00:36:51,811 --> 00:36:53,910
If Dan was so happy that you showed up,

1487
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:59,130
you imagine some big white dude
from America out of nowhere.

1488
00:36:59,190 --> 00:36:59,611
It's just like,

1489
00:36:59,611 --> 00:36:59,791
Hey,

1490
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:01,130
I'm going to live with
you guys and make well.

1491
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:02,011
They'd be like,

1492
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:02,161
yeah,

1493
00:37:02,161 --> 00:37:02,994
sure you are.

1494
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:07,320
Nobody didn't come down here and
made a well to fuck outta here.

1495
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:07,810
Yeah,

1496
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,210
mean you made 70 wells.

1497
00:37:09,211 --> 00:37:09,991
Now they must be like,

1498
00:37:09,991 --> 00:37:11,580
how is this possible?

1499
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,121
Yeah,

1500
00:37:12,121 --> 00:37:12,400
well,

1501
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,370
well what I love is the,

1502
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,650
the heroes of this are
our 32 well drillers.

1503
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:20,700
We even have now you have to share on
your podcasts last time that Pacha soap,

1504
00:37:20,701 --> 00:37:25,110
which was inspired by this podcast and
listening to this working at night,

1505
00:37:25,111 --> 00:37:27,750
the night shift and having
a dream to start Pacha soap,

1506
00:37:27,751 --> 00:37:31,350
which is in whole foods and they got
another brand that's in target is super

1507
00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:33,480
successful and it's awesome.

1508
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:33,870
Yeah.

1509
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,070
They're helping us buy land.

1510
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:39,630
They're in the Congo and we're still
starting up a soap production facility,

1511
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,650
so we have an essential oil press and
we're hiring the locals to be able to get

1512
00:37:43,651 --> 00:37:47,610
all this central oils that you can flip
this and avocado oil and palm oil and

1513
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:51,210
different raw materials because the only
thing they have available to him right

1514
00:37:51,211 --> 00:37:51,361
now,

1515
00:37:51,361 --> 00:37:52,440
his car washing soap,

1516
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,840
that's literally from China or from India.

1517
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,400
It's just packed with chemicals.

1518
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:56,590
Right.

1519
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:57,241
When I use it,

1520
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:58,074
let me raw.

1521
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:02,490
I mean like in pain from it
and so off with no soap at all.

1522
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:03,810
Just wash yourself with dirt.

1523
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:04,470
Right.

1524
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,570
And so you can do that
if people don't know,

1525
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,920
if you just take dirt,

1526
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,440
like if you're somewhere
and there's no no soap,

1527
00:38:10,441 --> 00:38:15,441
just take dirt and just literally use
water and mud and just wash yourself with

1528
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:17,250
the dirt and then rinse it all off.

1529
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:19,770
You just trying to scrub
off the bullshit and dirt.

1530
00:38:19,771 --> 00:38:22,140
It's probably better for
you than antibiotic soaps.

1531
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,333
Yeah,

1532
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,300
for sure.

1533
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,000
And so we're about to get two
to 3000 acres more of Lance.

1534
00:38:27,001 --> 00:38:27,930
We have 3000 there,

1535
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:28,710
NASA man.

1536
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,380
And it's about to be five to 6,000 acres.

1537
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,800
If we reach out and reach out to people,

1538
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:38,170
cause I know a lot of people do like
to go to places like that and teach

1539
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:39,004
English.

1540
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,160
What if there was a way or will it be
the language to Teesha would be most

1541
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:43,450
beneficial for them down there?

1542
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,710
So language wise is really
tough because when they speak,

1543
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,380
there's over 200 spoken
languages in Congo,

1544
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:51,243
over 200.

1545
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,260
There's five national languages.

1546
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:53,890
Uh,

1547
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:56,290
the government and schools and hospitals,

1548
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:56,620
uh,

1549
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,453
is French,

1550
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,410
has colonized by Belgium.

1551
00:38:59,560 --> 00:38:59,950
Uh,

1552
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,230
and it's,

1553
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,230
that's a nuts story.

1554
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,010
Um,

1555
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:03,431
but then,

1556
00:39:03,431 --> 00:39:04,264
uh,

1557
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,400
they also speak Swahili in the east.

1558
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,300
Um,

1559
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,580
they speak Lingala in the west.

1560
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:10,030
Uh,

1561
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:12,910
they speak bannock Kongo and
there's one more that I'm missing.

1562
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:13,630
Um,

1563
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,411
when you talk to them,

1564
00:39:14,411 --> 00:39:14,810
how do you,

1565
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,660
what do you talk to them more?

1566
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:16,541
So I very,

1567
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:18,520
very broken a Swahili,

1568
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:18,941
very,

1569
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:19,870
very broken Swahili,

1570
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,840
but the Swahili they speak there is,

1571
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:23,703
um,

1572
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,750
it's mixed with a little bit of French.

1573
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:26,320
Um,

1574
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,250
and also,

1575
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:27,430
uh,

1576
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,360
the local language.

1577
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,403
So you,

1578
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,570
you've got to truly live there.

1579
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,220
And over the last six years,

1580
00:39:33,221 --> 00:39:36,400
I've been there for about
maybe a year and seven,

1581
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:36,670
eight,

1582
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,750
you're nine months,

1583
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:38,020
uh,

1584
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:38,853
boots on the ground.

1585
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,910
I'm a year at one time and then a man,

1586
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:42,190
but,

1587
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:42,601
but the,

1588
00:39:42,601 --> 00:39:45,490
the saying about Swahili is
that it was born in Tanzania.

1589
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:50,710
It got sick and Kenya died in Uganda
and they took it to the Congo to bury it

1590
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,630
because they can't
communicate with anyone.

1591
00:39:52,631 --> 00:39:53,470
And you've got another,

1592
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:53,831
I mean,

1593
00:39:53,831 --> 00:39:54,041
not,

1594
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:56,320
not truly communicate and
get their point across.

1595
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,670
So it's really tough teaching them
English is teaching them how to read.

1596
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:05,110
Like I just think that if you could
somehow another teach them some language

1597
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:08,200
where they could read and
write things down and you like,

1598
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:09,820
you could just keep the,

1599
00:40:09,821 --> 00:40:12,790
keep this thing going with
them while they're there.

1600
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,061
What,

1601
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:14,890
what I think is really cool is now,

1602
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,753
um,

1603
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:16,151
we,

1604
00:40:16,151 --> 00:40:17,620
we've got this video up on,

1605
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,090
it's on youtube.

1606
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:21,100
It's chiefly Omaze transformation.

1607
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,570
And so chief Leo May,

1608
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,230
uh,

1609
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,130
in his village,

1610
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,750
it was just an incredible transformation.

1611
00:40:25,751 --> 00:40:27,460
They had never owned land of their own,

1612
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:27,971
but chiefly,

1613
00:40:27,971 --> 00:40:28,061
oh,

1614
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:32,680
Mae remembered his grandfather used to
actually take him to hunt on that land

1615
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:33,700
that they now own.

1616
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:34,781
And so,

1617
00:40:34,781 --> 00:40:35,050
uh,

1618
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:37,510
now it's theirs and his grandson's
going to be able to say,

1619
00:40:37,511 --> 00:40:37,750
you know,

1620
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,220
this was my grandfather's land.

1621
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,450
Just like he's able to say,

1622
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:40,720
you know,

1623
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,370
I used to hunt with my grandfather here,

1624
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:43,510
but um,

1625
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,040
so from the land that they have,

1626
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:45,581
they have land,

1627
00:40:45,581 --> 00:40:46,331
water and food there.

1628
00:40:46,331 --> 00:40:48,250
They have about 500 acres I believe.

1629
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:53,470
And so then they have their own water and
now they've grown so many banana trees

1630
00:40:53,471 --> 00:40:53,890
there.

1631
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:58,300
They used to get paid one to two bananas
a day for Labor from sunup to sundown,

1632
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,950
a banana or two a day.

1633
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:02,590
Now they have hundreds and
hundreds of banana trees.

1634
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,030
I mean probably five,

1635
00:41:04,031 --> 00:41:06,580
600 banana trees and that one village.

1636
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:08,200
And from that they're able to go sell it.

1637
00:41:08,201 --> 00:41:08,831
When they sell it,

1638
00:41:08,831 --> 00:41:10,900
they can buy their own
clothes for the first time.

1639
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,430
They cannot now pay school fees so that
they can actually go to the local school

1640
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:16,960
and learn to read and write.

1641
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,340
It's a little bit of a hike for them,

1642
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,260
but they can go learn and read and write.

1643
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:21,550
And so it's the first time that,

1644
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,200
I mean it could even create
an opportunity for them,

1645
00:41:24,201 --> 00:41:29,201
a boothy pygmies to have representation
at their version of Congress in the

1646
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:31,210
Congo for the first time ever,

1647
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,100
there's over 200 tribes represented there.

1648
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:36,140
The only one not represented
is the my booty pygmies.

1649
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:38,060
And so to get them educated,

1650
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,180
the excuse he used to be
from the government was,

1651
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:40,730
they're not,

1652
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,620
they're not really people.

1653
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:43,670
They're part man,

1654
00:41:43,671 --> 00:41:44,504
part animal.

1655
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:48,140
That was the government saying that
I think in the early two thousands,

1656
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,790
maybe the late nineties,

1657
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:50,621
early two thousands,

1658
00:41:50,621 --> 00:41:51,650
they're saying they were half man,

1659
00:41:51,651 --> 00:41:53,990
half animal that they'll
never have representation.

1660
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,630
But now it started to shift to
where we even have a governor,

1661
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,790
the governor of the
largest state in Congo,

1662
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,510
um,

1663
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,640
sponsoring everything we do,

1664
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,061
you know,

1665
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:02,751
endorsing it,

1666
00:42:02,751 --> 00:42:03,051
saying,

1667
00:42:03,051 --> 00:42:03,290
Hey,

1668
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:07,250
you have free range of the tree region
and we want you to drill here and we want

1669
00:42:07,251 --> 00:42:08,084
you to drill there.

1670
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,340
And so he's actually come
on our side and said,

1671
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:12,980
what the work you guys are doing is
really great because it's through the

1672
00:42:12,981 --> 00:42:13,401
locals,

1673
00:42:13,401 --> 00:42:14,270
it's locally led.

1674
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,110
Um,

1675
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,940
and so to have that opportunity,

1676
00:42:16,941 --> 00:42:19,370
once some of the [inaudible]
pygmies are educated,

1677
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:20,720
have a high school education,

1678
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:22,700
maybe we can get them
to a local university.

1679
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,320
They're right next door,

1680
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:25,641
maybe in Uganda,

1681
00:42:25,641 --> 00:42:26,091
Rwanda,

1682
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:26,924
Kenya,

1683
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,440
um,

1684
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,110
then they can go back and they can
actually start representing themselves.

1685
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:30,650
Um,

1686
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,450
because now they say if they're educated,

1687
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:32,961
then we can't.

1688
00:42:32,961 --> 00:42:33,980
But none of them are educated.

1689
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,440
So I would draw out the process longer,

1690
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,361
but now they're the,

1691
00:42:37,361 --> 00:42:37,640
you know,

1692
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,810
the next generation will be,

1693
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:42,350
and that's what's inspired
you also to get back into MMA.

1694
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:42,950
Yeah.

1695
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:45,420
And that inspired you
to sign up with bell.

1696
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,940
And since then you've had three fights,

1697
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:47,780
three fights,

1698
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,710
and won all three,

1699
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,340
and now you're one of the top
Bellator heavyweight contenders.

1700
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:52,880
Yeah.

1701
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,310
It was kind of crazy because
when we first talked,

1702
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,480
you hadn't fought in a long
time and you were five years,

1703
00:42:59,481 --> 00:42:59,961
two months.

1704
00:42:59,961 --> 00:43:00,190
Yeah.

1705
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:01,190
And you weren't training.

1706
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:04,520
You were just kind of like going
back and forth to the Congo and then,

1707
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,043
you know,

1708
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,270
that had to be a crazy thing to just get
back into it after all that time out.

1709
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,830
It was the hardest thing I've ever done.

1710
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:13,460
Um,

1711
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:17,450
physically at least I'm sure to get
yourself back in that kind of shape in

1712
00:43:17,451 --> 00:43:19,280
between my first and second fight back,

1713
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,330
I had malaria again.

1714
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:20,651
Um,

1715
00:43:20,651 --> 00:43:22,430
and that was my third time to have that.

1716
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:24,010
He's got malaria three times folks.

1717
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:28,820
And so that time I got malaria while
I was there because it was so bad.

1718
00:43:28,821 --> 00:43:30,260
I broke out in shingles,

1719
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,100
um,

1720
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:31,520
which,

1721
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:31,791
you know,

1722
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:33,590
being 30 just now turning 30.

1723
00:43:33,591 --> 00:43:35,180
So then I was like 28 or 29,

1724
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:36,110
um,

1725
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:36,741
to have shingles.

1726
00:43:36,741 --> 00:43:37,251
The doctor's like,

1727
00:43:37,251 --> 00:43:38,150
you're too young for this.

1728
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,610
And my body was just that
stress down for shingles.

1729
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:40,880
Yeah,

1730
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,110
I get people getting shingles.

1731
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,480
Well I guess normally that
might be like met herpes,

1732
00:43:47,481 --> 00:43:48,111
something like that.

1733
00:43:48,111 --> 00:43:52,520
But they did the culture or whatever and
it was shingles and it's supposed to be

1734
00:43:52,521 --> 00:43:54,050
an older generation thing I think.

1735
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:54,710
And uh,

1736
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:55,191
no kidding.

1737
00:43:55,191 --> 00:43:56,024
I didn't know shingles.

1738
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,970
Is it because they say it
starts like 40 and beyond,

1739
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:01,060
is it a compromised immune issue is out.

1740
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:02,210
It is the idea.

1741
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:03,680
And so it's,

1742
00:44:03,681 --> 00:44:06,470
it's actually chicken pox
coming back out and your body.

1743
00:44:06,471 --> 00:44:07,730
So if you haven't had chicken pox,

1744
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:08,564
you cap shingles.

1745
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:12,710
And so it's like it lays dormant in your
body and then once you get into older

1746
00:44:12,711 --> 00:44:14,870
age or your immune system is compromised,

1747
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:15,733
then shingles can,

1748
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:20,180
that is the most fucked up thing about
the human body that it harbors these

1749
00:44:20,181 --> 00:44:22,010
bacterias and they sit there waiting,

1750
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,550
just fuck up your life.

1751
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,133
Yeah.

1752
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:28,221
Yeah.

1753
00:44:28,221 --> 00:44:29,060
And so then I had,

1754
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:29,840
oh man,

1755
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,140
dude,

1756
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:30,973
I had that.

1757
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:35,580
Then I had shingles and then I came back
and for a month or two months or the

1758
00:44:35,581 --> 00:44:38,070
doctors are trying to figure out what
was wrong with me because I was clear on

1759
00:44:38,071 --> 00:44:38,900
malaria.

1760
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:39,210
Um,

1761
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,260
but the CDC to,

1762
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,690
to test on me for malaria again,

1763
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,960
but they found out I had
dengue fever every night.

1764
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,793
I was going to sleep.

1765
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:48,780
I was waking up and that was probably,

1766
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:49,950
did you tell him you ate a monkey?

1767
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:51,990
I did.

1768
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:52,291
I did.

1769
00:44:52,291 --> 00:44:53,124
And then they wanted,

1770
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:57,390
they wanted to do the
corn team thing on me.

1771
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:57,770
Um,

1772
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:58,530
and so,

1773
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:01,890
but it had been over
three months since I had,

1774
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,990
since a bullet had broken out.

1775
00:45:03,991 --> 00:45:06,230
And it had been three months
since I've been back into a bowl.

1776
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,110
A bowl was like,

1777
00:45:07,111 --> 00:45:07,900
you're going to kill us all.

1778
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:08,790
Just like a year ago.

1779
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,660
Everybody's freaking out of that one
lady who was a nurse who wouldn't be

1780
00:45:12,661 --> 00:45:13,201
quarantined.

1781
00:45:13,201 --> 00:45:13,441
She's like,

1782
00:45:13,441 --> 00:45:13,831
fuck you,

1783
00:45:13,831 --> 00:45:14,641
I'm going outside.

1784
00:45:14,641 --> 00:45:14,820
Like,

1785
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:15,560
no,

1786
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,730
she's going to kill us
all you selfish bitch.

1787
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,020
So,

1788
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,090
so a Bolo was actually
discovered in Congo.

1789
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,980
There's a river called the Ebola river.

1790
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:23,221
Oh,

1791
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:23,620
great.

1792
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:23,970
Um,

1793
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:24,900
and so that's,

1794
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:28,230
that's where it was discovered and it
actually came back and broke out since the

1795
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:29,130
big crazy one.

1796
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,230
It broke out and I think it was
like less than a hundred people.

1797
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:33,840
It might have been like 10 or less.

1798
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:35,550
And so they really were
able to contain it,

1799
00:45:35,551 --> 00:45:39,100
which is impressive to be able to do in
Congo because it's not as organized as,

1800
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:39,993
as anywhere else.

1801
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,093
Um,

1802
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:41,701
but yeah,

1803
00:45:41,701 --> 00:45:42,450
so man,

1804
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:44,220
but on the MMA journey back,

1805
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:45,450
it was,

1806
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:46,350
it was really,

1807
00:45:46,351 --> 00:45:46,920
really tough.

1808
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,161
I mean,

1809
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:50,100
the muscle memory just was not there.

1810
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:53,010
I had lost the wrestling I grew up with,

1811
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:54,060
um,

1812
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:57,300
and the cardio obviously wasn't
there after five years off.

1813
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:58,040
Um,

1814
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:58,940
but the sicknesses,

1815
00:45:58,950 --> 00:45:59,700
other things,

1816
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,810
my body was healed.

1817
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:01,170
Uh,

1818
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:04,140
the muscles and joints and
ligaments and all that.

1819
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:04,950
I think a,

1820
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:06,660
I felt better than ever there.

1821
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,850
It was just the muscle
memory wasn't coming back.

1822
00:46:08,851 --> 00:46:09,470
And,

1823
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:09,900
um,

1824
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:14,340
the cardio is really tough and I had
to shed some weight and get healthy.

1825
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,170
The muscles in the cartilage,

1826
00:46:16,171 --> 00:46:17,130
in the joints and everything like that,

1827
00:46:17,131 --> 00:46:19,050
they're probably benefited
from all that time off.

1828
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:19,350
Right.

1829
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:20,330
I think so a lot.

1830
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,450
Cause somebody guys get,

1831
00:46:21,451 --> 00:46:22,800
by the time you're 30,

1832
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:23,161
I mean,

1833
00:46:23,161 --> 00:46:27,510
how many MMA fighters or just have like
really huge injuries by the time you're

1834
00:46:27,511 --> 00:46:27,871
30,

1835
00:46:27,871 --> 00:46:28,800
31 years old,

1836
00:46:28,801 --> 00:46:29,730
it's pretty common.

1837
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:30,780
You got to start.

1838
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:31,860
I started fighting,

1839
00:46:31,861 --> 00:46:32,460
uh,

1840
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,630
at 19 years old,

1841
00:46:33,631 --> 00:46:34,740
professionally MMA.

1842
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,550
And so,

1843
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:36,180
um,

1844
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,670
and I was always the young guy
in the heavyweight division.

1845
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:39,190
Um,

1846
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:41,430
and so now just turning 30,

1847
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,610
I feel like you've got a lot of miles
left on me having those five years off.

1848
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,560
And so life experience too,

1849
00:46:46,561 --> 00:46:46,980
right?

1850
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:47,460
Yeah.

1851
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:47,641
Yeah.

1852
00:46:47,641 --> 00:46:49,530
And I honestly think a
lot of people are like,

1853
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:49,771
oh,

1854
00:46:49,771 --> 00:46:50,460
so you didn't,

1855
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:51,480
you took off.

1856
00:46:51,481 --> 00:46:53,130
And that's probably impossible for me.

1857
00:46:53,131 --> 00:46:54,960
It was a whole other kind of training.

1858
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:59,100
I mean Kinda like I was talking about
Raphael and the being comfortable being

1859
00:46:59,101 --> 00:46:59,934
uncomfortable.

1860
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,220
I mean I've slept in the mud.

1861
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:03,170
A woke up in the mud,

1862
00:47:03,171 --> 00:47:04,110
at least slept on the dirt,

1863
00:47:04,111 --> 00:47:07,460
woke up in the mud because the rain
came so hard and sleeping under tweaking

1864
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:08,610
leaf huts on the dirt,

1865
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,030
you know,

1866
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:09,690
no,

1867
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:10,650
no mattress underneath,

1868
00:47:10,651 --> 00:47:10,951
you know,

1869
00:47:10,951 --> 00:47:11,784
anything.

1870
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,210
Um,

1871
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:16,920
and so me and have that to
battle through the sicknesses to,

1872
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:21,950
to see what they suffer from and
how they dig deep on a daily basis.

1873
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:23,870
Um,

1874
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:24,150
they're,

1875
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:27,600
they're in survival mode and
the see the battles they fight.

1876
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:28,463
And then to have,

1877
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:28,900
you know,

1878
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,130
32 of my heroes

1879
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:34,000
there that have drilled 70 wells that
whenever a bridge collapses because a

1880
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:37,660
truck is illegally logging
and they overloaded their,

1881
00:47:37,661 --> 00:47:42,370
their weight and they just collapsed
this 1930s bridge and then I think,

1882
00:47:42,371 --> 00:47:42,550
oh,

1883
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:43,540
it's going to be impossible.

1884
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:45,280
And then they get out of the truck,

1885
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:50,200
they start walking through the water
with all our welding equipment and we're

1886
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:51,160
going to find another way.

1887
00:47:51,161 --> 00:47:54,350
We're going to get a taxi motorcycles to,

1888
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:57,160
to ride in everything we
needed this big truck,

1889
00:47:57,330 --> 00:47:57,610
uh,

1890
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:58,443
to carry on.

1891
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,070
And so it's going to take a lot longer.

1892
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,060
It's going to be a lot harder,

1893
00:48:01,061 --> 00:48:02,800
but we're going to get it done
or we're going to win this fight.

1894
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:06,490
So you feel like that was a
training sort of tool for yeah,

1895
00:48:06,491 --> 00:48:06,761
I mean,

1896
00:48:06,761 --> 00:48:07,481
I'm not going to say this,

1897
00:48:07,481 --> 00:48:07,751
but,

1898
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:08,350
um,

1899
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:09,700
or I don't want to compare it to this,

1900
00:48:09,701 --> 00:48:11,480
but it's almost like a,

1901
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:15,520
it was a life experience and kind
of like some of our navy guys,

1902
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:16,331
Navy seals,

1903
00:48:16,331 --> 00:48:18,100
and they do the special forces training.

1904
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:19,150
Um,

1905
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:23,410
I think this was my version of like
kind of special training for me as a

1906
00:48:23,411 --> 00:48:23,870
fighter.

1907
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:25,120
It enlargened,

1908
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:25,900
uh,

1909
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,420
my heart or deepen the well of who I am.

1910
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,080
Um,

1911
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,390
and so I think I just
have more of a motivation,

1912
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:31,930
uh,

1913
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:32,800
to go in there.

1914
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:37,160
And when the name of the Guy Action
game has really come up a lot now,

1915
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:37,750
yeah,

1916
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:40,990
it does still have the wrestling and
now my submission game is on point being

1917
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,830
you're a blue belt now under Lavato rice.

1918
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:44,410
Yeah.

1919
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:45,243
And uh,

1920
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:47,980
and I wanted to do it the right way.

1921
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,740
I want to do it the way that
every other student does it.

1922
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:52,121
And so it was,

1923
00:48:52,121 --> 00:48:53,650
it was really cool to get that.

1924
00:48:53,651 --> 00:48:55,690
I didn't know that that
would mean so much to me,

1925
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:56,490
but it,

1926
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:57,323
but it really did.

1927
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:58,030
Yeah,

1928
00:48:58,030 --> 00:48:59,080
it's nuts man.

1929
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,010
It's nuts.

1930
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:02,410
How that war that,

1931
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:03,550
that promotion,

1932
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:04,743
um,

1933
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,060
is a milestone in my martial arts journey.

1934
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,560
That's why it's so good for kids.

1935
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:11,560
Martial arts are so good for kids
because it gives them a tangible

1936
00:49:11,561 --> 00:49:13,480
representation of their hard work.

1937
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:14,560
Like you get,

1938
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,620
give them a belt and a tie on that belt
and have this giant smile on my face.

1939
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:17,950
You know,

1940
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:18,783
when my kids,

1941
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:21,280
my kids take martial arts
and when they get a new belt,

1942
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:22,930
they have this giant smile on their face.

1943
00:49:22,931 --> 00:49:24,640
They're so happy to jump around.

1944
00:49:24,641 --> 00:49:25,331
They look at it,

1945
00:49:25,331 --> 00:49:26,350
they want to wear it home.

1946
00:49:26,351 --> 00:49:27,730
And that was me squeeze it.

1947
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:28,210
Yeah,

1948
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:28,601
me too,

1949
00:49:28,601 --> 00:49:28,841
man.

1950
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:29,980
I remember when I got my blue belt,

1951
00:49:29,981 --> 00:49:30,251
I was like,

1952
00:49:30,251 --> 00:49:30,881
Holy Shit,

1953
00:49:30,881 --> 00:49:32,110
I'm not a white belt anymore.

1954
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,193
Yes.

1955
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:33,821
You know,

1956
00:49:33,821 --> 00:49:36,240
you feel like I made it
over the hump and the,

1957
00:49:36,241 --> 00:49:38,080
what they say is if you
could make it to purple belt,

1958
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,330
you can make it a black belt.

1959
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:41,140
That's the blue belt is like,

1960
00:49:41,141 --> 00:49:42,160
you're just working hard.

1961
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,000
If you work hard,

1962
00:49:43,001 --> 00:49:43,810
you get there.

1963
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:44,350
Hey,

1964
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:44,621
you know,

1965
00:49:44,621 --> 00:49:45,454
you're not,

1966
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,500
you're not ed white belt anymore,

1967
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,730
but if you can get to purple belt,

1968
00:49:48,731 --> 00:49:48,910
like,

1969
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:49,743
Hey man,

1970
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:54,810
just keep going and you can be a black
belt in Lovato's school of Brazilian Jiu

1971
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:55,361
Jitsu.

1972
00:49:55,361 --> 00:49:58,540
It says I'm a black belt as
a white belt who never quit.

1973
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,500
Yeah,

1974
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:00,943
I've heard that before.

1975
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:01,720
Yeah,

1976
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,231
I like it,

1977
00:50:02,231 --> 00:50:02,680
man.

1978
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,100
It's an interesting time
now for Jujitsu and MMA.

1979
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:09,790
It really is because you're
seeing like some guys like,

1980
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:10,630
uh,

1981
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:11,770
this weekend,

1982
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:13,010
Brian or teas.

1983
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:13,710
Hmm.

1984
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:14,543
Um,

1985
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:15,521
or Tayga rather.

1986
00:50:15,521 --> 00:50:17,560
Brian Ortega is fighting a cub.

1987
00:50:17,561 --> 00:50:19,660
Swanson and Brian Ortega tease.

1988
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:20,860
I'm trying to remember his name.

1989
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,300
Nickname t city.

1990
00:50:22,301 --> 00:50:23,380
Tisa triangle city.

1991
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,540
He's got one of the best guards in MMA.

1992
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:25,900
Yeah.

1993
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,070
An Ortega is fucking nasty

1994
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:29,000
off of his back.

1995
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:29,661
I mean,

1996
00:50:29,661 --> 00:50:30,494
he's just,

1997
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,510
he's so good.

1998
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,070
You think you loads of them to sleep with
his baby blue eyes and then he locked

1999
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:36,720
space,

2000
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,230
beautiful face as long
flowing locks just like you.

2001
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:39,681
Yeah.

2002
00:50:39,681 --> 00:50:41,030
So Brian is,

2003
00:50:41,031 --> 00:50:41,660
um,

2004
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:42,620
in my opinion,

2005
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:46,460
probably the best guy in the
division off of his back.

2006
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:50,330
I don't think there's anybody that could
fuck with him at one 45 especially now

2007
00:50:50,331 --> 00:50:53,810
that Charles Olivera is moved up to a 55.

2008
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:55,700
I think he's the best at 45.

2009
00:50:55,701 --> 00:51:00,701
His fucking submission game
is so lightening lightening
fast and just tight as

2010
00:51:01,221 --> 00:51:02,030
can be.

2011
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:06,500
But cubs Swanson's a black belt in
Brazilian Jujitsu to and Carb is a nasty

2012
00:51:06,501 --> 00:51:08,780
striker to and super unorthodox,

2013
00:51:08,781 --> 00:51:09,614
like real weird.

2014
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:14,690
But Brian is a fucking great striker to
and Brian is an motherfucking defeated

2015
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:18,650
12 and older with a one no contest.

2016
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:19,431
So,

2017
00:51:19,431 --> 00:51:19,700
um,

2018
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:20,630
I'm an interesting fight.

2019
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:22,030
Fuck yet is,

2020
00:51:22,031 --> 00:51:22,251
it's,

2021
00:51:22,251 --> 00:51:22,761
it's like,

2022
00:51:22,761 --> 00:51:23,410
uh,

2023
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:23,870
uh,

2024
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:24,703
you know,

2025
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:25,190
it's,

2026
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:27,050
it's a real crossroads
fight in a lot of ways.

2027
00:51:27,051 --> 00:51:30,440
Cause cub is at the top of the
heap and the 145 pound division,

2028
00:51:30,441 --> 00:51:32,510
he's lost to some of the big guys.

2029
00:51:32,511 --> 00:51:34,880
Like Max Holloway lost a Frankie Edgar.

2030
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:39,710
But he's still really respected and
thought of as one of the top guys in the

2031
00:51:39,711 --> 00:51:44,711
division and Ortega being this young
prodigy at 12 and now has this opportunity

2032
00:51:44,751 --> 00:51:49,010
now to fight one of the most
crafty veterans in the division.

2033
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:49,830
I like.

2034
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:52,370
It sounds like a similar
opportunity that Nigga just had.

2035
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,391
Francis just had,

2036
00:51:53,391 --> 00:51:54,120
you know to,

2037
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:57,800
to be that young lion you have to
come up and around the guy and really

2038
00:51:57,801 --> 00:52:01,250
announced himself as one of
the top contenders or tell
you can submit anybody in

2039
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:01,611
the world.

2040
00:52:01,611 --> 00:52:02,960
I really believe that and he,

2041
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:04,340
he'll box with you too.

2042
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:08,840
The thing about Ortega is like he'll
make it seem like there is no intention

2043
00:52:08,841 --> 00:52:13,280
whatsoever to go to the ground and then
sometimes he boxes guys up and then when

2044
00:52:13,281 --> 00:52:15,470
they want to take him to the ground
because they don't like to stand up,

2045
00:52:15,471 --> 00:52:16,550
that's when they're Foxville.

2046
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:20,240
He's got an interesting strategy in that
regard because in the last fight I was

2047
00:52:20,241 --> 00:52:20,751
thinking like,

2048
00:52:20,751 --> 00:52:20,991
wow,

2049
00:52:20,991 --> 00:52:22,100
this is kind of interesting.

2050
00:52:22,101 --> 00:52:23,090
We're in the third round.

2051
00:52:23,091 --> 00:52:24,920
He's still has not tried
to submit this guy.

2052
00:52:24,921 --> 00:52:25,160
Like,

2053
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,060
that's his game.

2054
00:52:26,061 --> 00:52:26,894
And then boom,

2055
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:29,610
they go to the ground and he instantly
catches him with a good team.

2056
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:31,010
But the reason they went to the ground,

2057
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,740
his opponent took him down cause
he didn't like the stand up.

2058
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:34,520
That's smart.

2059
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:34,821
Yeah.

2060
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:35,810
So his strategy,

2061
00:52:35,811 --> 00:52:38,180
his standup keeps coming up
higher and higher and higher.

2062
00:52:38,181 --> 00:52:39,920
But when it comes to Jujitsu,

2063
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:41,990
he's one of the very best in the sport.

2064
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:43,580
He's really good.

2065
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:44,990
How far away is he from here?

2066
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:45,711
Where he trains?

2067
00:52:45,711 --> 00:52:46,191
He's close.

2068
00:52:46,191 --> 00:52:47,090
He's in black house,

2069
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:48,410
black houses in Compton.

2070
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:49,190
Um,

2071
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:50,060
or that area.

2072
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:50,660
So it's,

2073
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:52,460
I don't know if it's exactly Compton,

2074
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,290
Compton adjacent,

2075
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:55,251
but uh,

2076
00:52:55,251 --> 00:52:56,630
so there's that go to the,

2077
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:58,640
go to the two to 19 card.

2078
00:52:58,790 --> 00:52:59,001
Oh,

2079
00:52:59,001 --> 00:52:59,630
you know what,

2080
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:00,740
go to the fucking,

2081
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:01,400
um,

2082
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,780
the Fox card.

2083
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,100
That's a big one.

2084
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:05,330
That is,

2085
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:07,160
yeah,

2086
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:07,880
that one right there.

2087
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:08,361
Oh Man.

2088
00:53:08,361 --> 00:53:13,361
Robbie Lawler Hofeld dose on Joe's good
lightweight and welterweight champ.

2089
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:14,241
Yeah,

2090
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:14,601
man,

2091
00:53:14,601 --> 00:53:19,070
that is fucking into arresting
and he's been doing so great man.

2092
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:19,701
Yeah,

2093
00:53:19,701 --> 00:53:21,200
well like Lovato,

2094
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,270
I mean a Dolson Joe's,

2095
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:24,620
what he has done,

2096
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:25,170
um,

2097
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:28,530
in going up from one 45 one 55 to one 70,

2098
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:29,161
there was like,

2099
00:53:29,161 --> 00:53:30,330
well he was the champ,

2100
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:31,500
but he lost Eddie Alvarez.

2101
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:31,860
Well,

2102
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:32,910
let's see how he does a one seven.

2103
00:53:32,911 --> 00:53:34,320
He looks way better.

2104
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:36,900
I mean steamrolling
people the way fucked up.

2105
00:53:36,901 --> 00:53:39,150
Neil Magni long kicked him to the ground,

2106
00:53:39,151 --> 00:53:39,781
took him to the ground,

2107
00:53:39,781 --> 00:53:40,614
smushed him.

2108
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,860
I mean he beat Terrick Safa
Dean and a stand up fight,

2109
00:53:43,861 --> 00:53:44,341
which is like,

2110
00:53:44,341 --> 00:53:45,110
wow.

2111
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:47,280
Safa Dean is world class striker.

2112
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:50,400
Neil Neil's a buddy of mine
and he is an absolute monster.

2113
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:50,710
And to,

2114
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:51,543
I've seen that fight.

2115
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:54,510
Rafael dos Anjos looks
incredible at this weight.

2116
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:55,171
Yeah,

2117
00:53:55,171 --> 00:53:56,004
he's uh,

2118
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:56,520
that's,

2119
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,820
it's very interesting cause I think
he's supposed to be at one 70 all along.

2120
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:03,450
It's not like he's a big one 55
or that's made it up to one 70.

2121
00:54:03,451 --> 00:54:04,830
But he's kind of small and 70 no,

2122
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:08,910
he looks like a one 70 and
of course east fighting,

2123
00:54:08,911 --> 00:54:09,810
one of the best ones,

2124
00:54:09,811 --> 00:54:11,790
seventies ever in the form of champ,

2125
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:12,653
Robbie Lawler.

2126
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:16,110
So that that should be
a perfect fight for Fox.

2127
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:17,363
Cause uh,

2128
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:18,300
you know,

2129
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:18,960
just to,

2130
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,830
for fun.

2131
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,900
I mean it's going to be
a chaotic fight for it.

2132
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,510
There's never been a goddamn
boring Robbie Lawler fight ever.

2133
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:25,230
Yeah.

2134
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:26,010
You know,

2135
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:27,690
he doesn't even know how
to have a boring fight.

2136
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:28,231
Very,

2137
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:28,441
very,

2138
00:54:28,441 --> 00:54:28,920
very true.

2139
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:29,970
What do you think of the lamas fight?

2140
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:31,351
I like it,

2141
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,720
but llamas was obviously training for,

2142
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:34,560
um,

2143
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,393
for Aldo.

2144
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:35,820
Right.

2145
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:36,720
And so,

2146
00:54:36,721 --> 00:54:37,200
uh,

2147
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:37,441
you know,

2148
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:39,210
he gets this change of guard.

2149
00:54:39,211 --> 00:54:40,890
Now he's fighting Josh Emett who's a,

2150
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,230
who's a tough customer and Emmett,

2151
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:44,130
a lot of people don't know him,

2152
00:54:44,131 --> 00:54:45,060
but he's 12 and one.

2153
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:46,920
It's a good fight.

2154
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:47,753
Very good fight.

2155
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:48,800
I'm excited.

2156
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,633
See how that goes out.

2157
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:50,543
Yeah.

2158
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:51,030
Yeah.

2159
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:52,080
I'm excited about that.

2160
00:54:52,081 --> 00:54:55,020
But I'm also excited about the
pons and Novio Mike Perry fight.

2161
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:55,620
Yeah.

2162
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:58,710
I almost want this fight to just happen.

2163
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,810
So Darren till can fight Mike Perry.

2164
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:03,000
I'm like,

2165
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,970
I'm almost like rooting for Mike
Perry just so he can get out of it.

2166
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:08,060
And they can make that
Darren till Mike Perry fight.

2167
00:55:08,061 --> 00:55:09,690
Cause if they do decide to make that,

2168
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:14,520
because I know they tried to make Mike
Perry versus Wonderboy and Dana even

2169
00:55:14,521 --> 00:55:16,050
announced it and,

2170
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:16,921
and Wonderboy was like,

2171
00:55:16,921 --> 00:55:17,161
hey,

2172
00:55:17,161 --> 00:55:17,401
hey,

2173
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:17,641
hey,

2174
00:55:17,641 --> 00:55:17,851
hey,

2175
00:55:17,851 --> 00:55:18,750
slow the fuck down.

2176
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,730
Like the guy had one fight in the UFC.

2177
00:55:20,731 --> 00:55:23,880
I just fought for the
title twice and then beat,

2178
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:24,803
um,

2179
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:25,230
uh,

2180
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:25,890
Jorge,

2181
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:26,723
uh,

2182
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:27,480
Mazda doll.

2183
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:27,900
Right.

2184
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:31,290
And then you're going to have me
fight this guy like right away.

2185
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:32,071
Like this is crazy.

2186
00:55:32,071 --> 00:55:32,581
And by the way,

2187
00:55:32,581 --> 00:55:33,414
my thumbs hurt.

2188
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,000
He had like injuries in his thumbs.

2189
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:36,431
He was like,

2190
00:55:36,431 --> 00:55:37,360
he got his thumbs were,

2191
00:55:37,361 --> 00:55:39,060
it was talking about it after
the fight that he fucked up,

2192
00:55:39,061 --> 00:55:40,080
the tenant is in its thumbs.

2193
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:41,200
When I was interviewing him,

2194
00:55:41,201 --> 00:55:41,461
he was like,

2195
00:55:41,461 --> 00:55:43,320
something happened in my hand
and I thought it broke it.

2196
00:55:43,321 --> 00:55:44,154
I'm not sure.

2197
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:45,090
So he's got,

2198
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:46,170
he's got a lot of arrest to,

2199
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:47,363
to go through.

2200
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:52,580
So Darren tills looking for an opponent
and they were talking about Darren till

2201
00:55:52,771 --> 00:55:54,330
versus [inaudible] Guzman,

2202
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:59,630
which is very exciting as well because
Camaros Guzman who slated go to UFC two

2203
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:02,880
19 loose mon is slated to fight against,

2204
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:03,843
um,

2205
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:04,770
meek mill.

2206
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,480
I've known him since we were 15.

2207
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,350
It was my,

2208
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:09,550
we grew up wrestling together a meal.

2209
00:56:09,551 --> 00:56:11,870
Meek mill's a rapper and
he smells the rapper.

2210
00:56:11,871 --> 00:56:12,704
Right?

2211
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:13,080
Yeah.

2212
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:13,950
What the Fuck's wrong with me?

2213
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:15,361
A meal.

2214
00:56:15,361 --> 00:56:16,580
Meek who is a,

2215
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:16,791
the,

2216
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:16,970
the,

2217
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:19,960
the crazy Viking
motherfucker in highschool.

2218
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:22,200
People called Huseman us man.

2219
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:22,970
Some reason.

2220
00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:23,390
Uh,

2221
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:24,160
but

2222
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,540
that's because of the way it's spelled.

2223
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:25,990
Yeah.

2224
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:27,250
But he was a terrifying guy.

2225
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:27,930
He is.

2226
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:29,950
He's one of the most
terrifying guys in the sport.

2227
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:32,260
What I love seeing is
I think in high school,

2228
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:33,191
our senior year,

2229
00:56:33,191 --> 00:56:34,840
I think he graduated,

2230
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:35,660
or sorry,

2231
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,300
I you finish his senior year,

2232
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:38,830
fourth in the state of Texas.

2233
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:39,640
Um,

2234
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,650
so number four and in wrestling,

2235
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:42,820
uh,

2236
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:47,560
and then he went on to
UNK or Nebraska Carney and

2237
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,130
never fought meek mill,

2238
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,670
make a meal.

2239
00:56:52,671 --> 00:56:53,930
Meek is a scary guy,

2240
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:56,540
was really looking forward to this fight.

2241
00:56:56,541 --> 00:56:59,720
And then there was some talk of the
fight night taking place because Amil

2242
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:00,830
couldn't get his visa,

2243
00:57:00,831 --> 00:57:01,461
set it out,

2244
00:57:01,461 --> 00:57:02,294
sorted out.

2245
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:04,340
But then he got it sorted
out and Comacho loose.

2246
00:57:04,341 --> 00:57:04,971
Mom was saying,

2247
00:57:04,971 --> 00:57:05,510
Hey,

2248
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:05,721
you know,

2249
00:57:05,721 --> 00:57:06,740
I've already moved on.

2250
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,460
And then so lately a meal,

2251
00:57:10,461 --> 00:57:10,970
Meeks,

2252
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:13,700
Instagram and a Twitter has been calling,

2253
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:14,290
oops.

2254
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:17,600
Monnet chicken and saying he's ducking
him and all kinds of crazy shit.

2255
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:20,060
So I do not know if this is official.

2256
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:24,240
I'm hoping this is official because
someone needs to challenge [inaudible].

2257
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:27,890
I think [inaudible] is one of the most
dangerous and scary guys in the division

2258
00:57:27,891 --> 00:57:29,330
and he's not being talked about.

2259
00:57:29,331 --> 00:57:30,380
So one of the top 10 that he's,

2260
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:31,340
he's earned that spot,

2261
00:57:31,341 --> 00:57:31,700
I think.

2262
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:32,570
I believe so too.

2263
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:37,280
There's so many tough guys in that
division that he's sort of kind of been

2264
00:57:37,281 --> 00:57:38,750
overlooked in my opinion.

2265
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:39,501
And to me,

2266
00:57:39,501 --> 00:57:40,430
when I watch him fight,

2267
00:57:40,431 --> 00:57:40,671
I'm like,

2268
00:57:40,671 --> 00:57:41,301
Jesus Christ,

2269
00:57:41,301 --> 00:57:42,890
this guy's a handful for everybody.

2270
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:43,700
I think.

2271
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:43,821
Ooh,

2272
00:57:43,821 --> 00:57:44,270
smoke.

2273
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:45,320
Pull that card back up please.

2274
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:45,970
I think,

2275
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:46,110
oops,

2276
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:47,660
mon is just a,

2277
00:57:47,661 --> 00:57:48,890
he's got all the tools.

2278
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:50,090
He's in his prime.

2279
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,850
He's fucking super dangerous everywhere.

2280
00:57:52,851 --> 00:57:53,720
Super Dangerous.

2281
00:57:53,721 --> 00:57:54,351
Standing up,

2282
00:57:54,351 --> 00:57:55,790
smashes people on the ground.

2283
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:58,430
Really fucking strong for the division.

2284
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,410
Top game out of control.

2285
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:00,921
You know,

2286
00:58:00,921 --> 00:58:02,780
we don't know what happens
when he gets put on his back.

2287
00:58:02,781 --> 00:58:04,640
We don't know what
happens if he gets tagged.

2288
00:58:04,641 --> 00:58:06,830
If he fights a world class
striker that could stand up.

2289
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:09,860
But what a meek mill
brings to the table a meal.

2290
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:10,760
Meek is,

2291
00:58:10,761 --> 00:58:11,594
I did it again.

2292
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:12,310
What uh,

2293
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:17,310
a meal meek brings to the table is
nasty power and a real warrior spirit.

2294
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:18,583
Yeah.

2295
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:19,520
Yeah.

2296
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,310
He came into the UFC after
a Kale victory over who?

2297
00:58:22,311 --> 00:58:23,300
Some are Paul Harris.

2298
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:24,950
Yeah,

2299
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:25,820
I remember I watched that.

2300
00:58:25,821 --> 00:58:28,390
I was like get this guy in the UFC please.

2301
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:29,140
Yeah,

2302
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:30,380
like he's a fucking animal.

2303
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:34,990
And the thing is everybody's
running away from tomorrow.

2304
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:35,180
Ooh,

2305
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:35,600
smart.

2306
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,830
Except a meal.

2307
00:58:36,831 --> 00:58:38,750
Meek and maybe meek mill.

2308
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:39,683
We haven't asked him.

2309
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:42,560
He said Colby Covington
stuff and I'm too right now.

2310
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:43,491
Oh,

2311
00:58:43,491 --> 00:58:44,121
I'm a come out.

2312
00:58:44,121 --> 00:58:44,241
What?

2313
00:58:44,241 --> 00:58:45,074
We sponsored that.

2314
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:45,830
Yeah,

2315
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:46,663
of course he has.

2316
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:48,373
Everybody's ducking him.

2317
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:53,650
But also Colby would be wise because
Colbys made so much noise after beating

2318
00:58:54,381 --> 00:58:55,580
Damien Maia and try,

2319
00:58:55,581 --> 00:58:56,960
he's trying to get a
fight with Tyron Woodley.

2320
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:58,093
He's trying to like,

2321
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:01,640
he's trying to promote himself and the
the worst way to promote yourself as to

2322
00:59:01,641 --> 00:59:02,151
fight tomorrow.

2323
00:59:02,151 --> 00:59:02,984
It was wa

2324
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:05,241
but a meal.

2325
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:06,020
Meek is like,

2326
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:06,711
get me in there,

2327
00:59:06,711 --> 00:59:07,041
bitch.

2328
00:59:07,041 --> 00:59:07,670
Let's do it.

2329
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:08,270
So I,

2330
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:12,110
I sincerely hope that this fight
actually takes place because I think,

2331
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:12,951
uh,

2332
00:59:12,951 --> 00:59:14,360
I think it's a fucking wicked,

2333
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:15,253
wicked fight.

2334
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:17,240
And I want to see if,

2335
00:59:17,241 --> 00:59:17,600
uh,

2336
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:22,600
a meal has any answers for the problems
Kamara Guzman brings to the octagon

2337
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,160
because no one has so far.

2338
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:25,941
And I mean,

2339
00:59:25,941 --> 00:59:27,380
he's got one loss in his record.

2340
00:59:27,381 --> 00:59:29,930
I do not know if that was in
the UFC or outside the EOC,

2341
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:33,590
but in the last few fights we've seen
him since he's won the ultimate fighter.

2342
00:59:33,591 --> 00:59:34,970
He's just been unstoppable.

2343
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:36,403
But again,

2344
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,140
not getting the credit that he deserves.

2345
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:39,501
Yeah,

2346
00:59:39,501 --> 00:59:40,040
it's all,

2347
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:43,820
all of his fights inside the
octagon seem to be all victories.

2348
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:44,220
He,

2349
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:47,120
he's one of the most naturally
athletic guys that I've ever known.

2350
00:59:47,121 --> 00:59:49,160
That's what I meant by
grown up wrestling with him.

2351
00:59:49,161 --> 00:59:51,920
He started wrestling in high school
and finished fourth in the state.

2352
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,530
But then you went onto the
NCAAs division two and just one,

2353
00:59:54,531 --> 00:59:54,830
two,

2354
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:57,530
I think two national titles
or maybe three and a,

2355
00:59:57,531 --> 01:00:01,340
he's a stud with a big fight for me
on this card is not just a title fight

2356
01:00:01,341 --> 01:00:02,540
between Cyborg and Holly Holm.

2357
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:02,901
But yeah,

2358
01:00:02,901 --> 01:00:03,734
that one,

2359
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:08,890
Khabib never got Madoff versus Edson
Barboza come on son number two and number

2360
01:00:10,221 --> 01:00:13,790
three in the lightweight division,

2361
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,500
which is the most stacked division,

2362
01:00:15,501 --> 01:00:17,620
I think it's like
lightweight and welterweight.

2363
01:00:17,621 --> 01:00:17,830
A lady,

2364
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:19,640
the two most stack divisions,

2365
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:21,050
but it's hard to,

2366
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:23,180
it's hard to pick which
one is most stacked.

2367
01:00:23,181 --> 01:00:24,440
But Jesus Christ,

2368
01:00:24,441 --> 01:00:25,274
I like this fight,

2369
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:26,480
like this fight a lot.

2370
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:28,670
And Apparently Nijmegen Madoff has a new,

2371
01:00:28,671 --> 01:00:30,040
according to Daniel Cormier,

2372
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:33,950
he told me number Madoff has a new
conditioning guy and a new or a new,

2373
01:00:33,951 --> 01:00:37,250
a Dietitian guy knew nutrition
guy and a nice dessert,

2374
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,270
no Tiramisu.

2375
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:40,010
It's backing off the Tiramisu.

2376
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,353
He's uh,

2377
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:41,901
got,

2378
01:00:41,901 --> 01:00:42,140
um,

2379
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:42,471
you know,

2380
01:00:42,471 --> 01:00:46,040
on a very strict diet plan and he's
far lighter than he's ever been.

2381
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,390
And we're headed into this fight,

2382
01:00:47,391 --> 01:00:48,230
this fight as in what,

2383
01:00:48,231 --> 01:00:49,280
two weeks now?

2384
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:53,120
The 30th and today is three weeks away.

2385
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,550
So very exciting.

2386
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:56,690
Very interesting.

2387
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:01,220
I'm fucking pumped for that fight because
Barboza is one of the best strikers in

2388
01:01:01,221 --> 01:01:02,330
the division for sure.

2389
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:04,070
And it could be,

2390
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:09,580
can't do anything wrong on the feet
because Ed's and I light him up for sure.

2391
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:13,520
I mean this is the best striker for sure.

2392
01:01:13,521 --> 01:01:14,990
The best striker that could be,

2393
01:01:14,991 --> 01:01:15,770
it was fought.

2394
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:19,310
He fought Michael Johnson who's a good
striker and Michael Johnson caught him

2395
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:20,930
and tagged them and had them rock.

2396
01:01:20,931 --> 01:01:25,490
And it was the first time we saw any
adversity whatsoever or any real,

2397
01:01:25,491 --> 01:01:26,930
a real struggle for Khabib.

2398
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,680
But he went on to dominate that fine.

2399
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:29,391
He took him to the ground,

2400
01:01:29,391 --> 01:01:30,560
just beat the shit out of him.

2401
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:32,300
And He's 24 and o,

2402
01:01:32,301 --> 01:01:33,620
which is unprecedented,

2403
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:34,341
you know,

2404
01:01:34,341 --> 01:01:38,330
24 and oh and just been
steamroll in everybody.

2405
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,310
So it's only like 30 right,

2406
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:42,080
29 30 something like that.

2407
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,760
I do not know his age,

2408
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:46,880
but I feel like he's not
even in his prime yet.

2409
01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:47,570
What,

2410
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:47,700
how,

2411
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:48,533
what does it say here?

2412
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:49,970
29 yeah.

2413
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:50,661
Yeah.

2414
01:01:50,661 --> 01:01:50,931
I mean,

2415
01:01:50,931 --> 01:01:51,530
he's like,

2416
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:55,130
he's like right at the door and let
him know he's had a bunch of injuries.

2417
01:01:55,131 --> 01:01:55,820
But if he can,

2418
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:57,530
if he can get healthy and stay healthy,

2419
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:58,250
man,

2420
01:01:58,250 --> 01:01:58,840
it's gonna be scary.

2421
01:01:58,840 --> 01:01:59,570
Seemingly does.

2422
01:01:59,570 --> 01:01:59,901
Yeah.

2423
01:01:59,901 --> 01:02:02,720
For Barboza it's all about just
keeping the fight standing.

2424
01:02:02,930 --> 01:02:05,690
And Barboza has wicked leg kicks.

2425
01:02:05,691 --> 01:02:07,550
He's the only guy in the UFC that stopped.

2426
01:02:07,551 --> 01:02:09,590
Two guys with leg kicks.

2427
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:11,083
Um,

2428
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:14,180
he stopped a hot fail.

2429
01:02:14,181 --> 01:02:17,450
Aloe Vera with leg kicks and Mike Lulo,

2430
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:18,381
both those guys.

2431
01:02:18,381 --> 01:02:19,214
You stopped with leg.

2432
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:20,490
How do I remember that?

2433
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:21,323
I don't know.

2434
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,020
But uh,

2435
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:22,441
his,

2436
01:02:22,441 --> 01:02:22,680
uh,

2437
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:23,010
his,

2438
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:26,670
his leg kicks are amongst the fastest
I've ever seen in any division.

2439
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:27,720
His switch kick,

2440
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:31,260
fastest switch kick I've ever seen
to fucking ridiculous when he,

2441
01:02:31,261 --> 01:02:32,160
when he lights it up,

2442
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:33,660
like off that left leg,

2443
01:02:33,661 --> 01:02:35,040
you like cheese us.

2444
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,020
Like it's like he's,

2445
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:41,130
he's getting there with half the time
that most worldclass fighters get there.

2446
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:42,323
Would that kick?

2447
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:43,740
So that's uh,

2448
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:44,573
that's interesting.

2449
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:45,380
Spinning Oak,

2450
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:47,850
he'll kick it as fast as most people.

2451
01:02:47,851 --> 01:02:48,990
Just normal head kick.

2452
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:49,200
Yeah,

2453
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,580
his spinning shit's out of control.

2454
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:52,560
He's just a ridiculous striker.

2455
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,320
But it's all about Norma coming off,

2456
01:02:55,321 --> 01:02:56,220
getting him to the ground,

2457
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:58,380
the questions he's going to
be all stuff to take down.

2458
01:02:58,381 --> 01:03:00,420
What's the strategy they have
for this guy on the feet?

2459
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:03,780
Are they going to have them open up
and possibly give up that take down or

2460
01:03:03,781 --> 01:03:04,201
they're going to have,

2461
01:03:04,201 --> 01:03:07,890
I'm cautious and just throwing punches
and just constantly worried about the

2462
01:03:07,891 --> 01:03:10,590
take down defense cause Nermana Madoff is,

2463
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:13,440
he has been unchallenged when
it comes to the grappling.

2464
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:15,570
He's so God damn strong.

2465
01:03:15,571 --> 01:03:16,404
It's Chris Dominant.

2466
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,030
Well even guys like Dos Anjos,

2467
01:03:18,031 --> 01:03:19,200
he's a black belt in Jujitsu.

2468
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,640
He usually puts the smush on people,

2469
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:21,400
you know,

2470
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:21,991
know my gun off,

2471
01:03:21,991 --> 01:03:23,040
puts the smush on him.

2472
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:24,840
He gets guys to break too.

2473
01:03:24,841 --> 01:03:25,980
Like you see it in their face.

2474
01:03:25,981 --> 01:03:26,251
They're like,

2475
01:03:26,251 --> 01:03:26,701
fuck,

2476
01:03:26,701 --> 01:03:28,080
I can't do anything against this guy.

2477
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:29,640
He grew up doing it to bears,

2478
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:32,280
so that's why for real look legitimate.

2479
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:33,450
Yeah.

2480
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:35,850
My wife didn't believe that so I had to
pull it up and show her and she's like,

2481
01:03:35,851 --> 01:03:36,151
what are,

2482
01:03:36,151 --> 01:03:37,060
what are they doing to him?

2483
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:37,831
Why?

2484
01:03:37,831 --> 01:03:38,760
That's how baby,

2485
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:40,530
why make that baby fight a bear?

2486
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:41,611
I was like six,

2487
01:03:41,611 --> 01:03:41,881
seven,

2488
01:03:41,881 --> 01:03:42,630
eight years old.

2489
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:43,770
There's just biting them in the R.

2490
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:44,431
Yeah.

2491
01:03:44,431 --> 01:03:46,890
Jimmy Rivera versus John Linacre.

2492
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:49,170
That's a fucking great fight too.

2493
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:50,730
That's up in the right hand corner there.

2494
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:51,900
Ooh,

2495
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:54,120
that's a good fight.

2496
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:55,400
That's a real good fight.

2497
01:03:55,410 --> 01:04:00,410
Jimmy Rivera has looked insanely good at
135 especially that victory over Uriah

2498
01:04:01,411 --> 01:04:01,830
Faber.

2499
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:03,510
I was super impressed with that.

2500
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:04,471
I was like,

2501
01:04:04,471 --> 01:04:05,250
wow.

2502
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,750
Like this guy is for real.

2503
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:07,980
I knew it was for real before,

2504
01:04:07,981 --> 01:04:11,670
but Rivera was supposed to
be fighting Dominick Cruz,

2505
01:04:11,671 --> 01:04:16,530
but Dominick Cruz broke his arm and
training and so now he's fighting John

2506
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:16,531
Linacre,

2507
01:04:16,531 --> 01:04:19,380
who's a scary fucking guy at one 35.

2508
01:04:19,570 --> 01:04:19,710
Yeah.

2509
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:22,080
I like this a lot for Jimmy
because you can just hear every,

2510
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,100
every interview he does.

2511
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:24,210
He's just hungry.

2512
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:27,360
Hungry for the chance to be world champ.

2513
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,310
Yeah.

2514
01:04:28,310 --> 01:04:29,250
It's exciting to see this.

2515
01:04:29,251 --> 01:04:31,110
Why haven't I like it too?

2516
01:04:31,111 --> 01:04:32,280
And there's interesting,

2517
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:32,820
um,

2518
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:35,670
Tj Dillashaw just shut John Linacre down.

2519
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:36,031
I mean,

2520
01:04:36,031 --> 01:04:40,110
completely shut down his offense and
almost was like having beautiful,

2521
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:40,620
beautiful,

2522
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:41,370
beautiful.

2523
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:41,581
I mean,

2524
01:04:41,581 --> 01:04:44,970
it was a perfect example of
how you play the matador.

2525
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:45,930
Like a,

2526
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:48,000
like a technical matador.

2527
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:48,361
I mean,

2528
01:04:48,361 --> 01:04:48,761
that was what,

2529
01:04:48,761 --> 01:04:53,040
one of his finest performances
because Linacre is fucking terrifying.

2530
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,320
Like everybody's in a war with Linacre,

2531
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:56,190
you know,

2532
01:04:56,190 --> 01:04:56,551
like,

2533
01:04:56,551 --> 01:04:56,880
uh,

2534
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:57,810
Ian McCall,

2535
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:00,760
like everybody who fights Linacre winds
up being these goddamn waterfront.

2536
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:01,620
Um,

2537
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:01,981
so many,

2538
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:02,880
so many guys,

2539
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:07,170
they get in there with him and they get
hit by him and you just see it on their

2540
01:05:07,171 --> 01:05:07,621
face.

2541
01:05:07,621 --> 01:05:08,850
Like Jesus Christ,

2542
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:10,980
he's one of the few guys that
actually earn that nickname.

2543
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,033
Tens of stone.

2544
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:12,550
Yeah.

2545
01:05:12,550 --> 01:05:13,111
Francisco,

2546
01:05:13,111 --> 01:05:13,620
they're out.

2547
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:14,520
Like so many guys,

2548
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:15,360
he's fought,

2549
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:18,670
he cracks them and you see
the look in their eyes like,

2550
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:19,061
Oh,

2551
01:05:19,061 --> 01:05:20,110
Christ.

2552
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:21,473
Um,

2553
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:23,950
so he beat Oh,

2554
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:24,611
oh,

2555
01:05:24,611 --> 01:05:24,971
okay.

2556
01:05:24,971 --> 01:05:26,350
He beat the Marlin Vera,

2557
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:29,380
which is a very good fight.

2558
01:05:29,381 --> 01:05:30,760
The TJ Dillashaw loss,

2559
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:35,761
I think was the most telling because Tj
Dillashaw figured out a way how to solve

2560
01:05:35,861 --> 01:05:38,830
that puzzle when John Dodson couldn't,

2561
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,390
which was really interesting.

2562
01:05:40,391 --> 01:05:44,020
John Dodson lost two Linacre when Dotson
was thought to be one of the best guys

2563
01:05:44,021 --> 01:05:45,340
in the division at one 35.

2564
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:46,001
And he lost him.

2565
01:05:46,001 --> 01:05:47,050
But a split decision,

2566
01:05:47,850 --> 01:05:48,071
you know,

2567
01:05:48,071 --> 01:05:52,090
he fucked up Michael McDonald and
the fight before that and he's just,

2568
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,710
he says something special man,

2569
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:54,191
you know,

2570
01:05:54,191 --> 01:05:55,030
he really is.

2571
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:55,871
He's,

2572
01:05:55,871 --> 01:05:56,290
um,

2573
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:57,970
he's a a tank of a guy.

2574
01:05:58,210 --> 01:06:00,790
But I really honestly believe that,

2575
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:01,120
uh,

2576
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:06,120
Jimmy Rivera is world class and I think
this is a good opportunity for him to

2577
01:06:06,851 --> 01:06:07,571
fight against,

2578
01:06:07,571 --> 01:06:08,080
uh,

2579
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:12,450
a big scary tank of a guy
in John Lineker and uh,

2580
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:13,530
and show his,

2581
01:06:13,531 --> 01:06:13,891
his,

2582
01:06:13,891 --> 01:06:14,300
his,

2583
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:15,850
his talent and his ability.

2584
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:17,530
I think it's a real test I want,

2585
01:06:17,531 --> 01:06:18,700
I'm really interesting to see,

2586
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:22,870
really interested to see how this
works out because Rivera's not like a,

2587
01:06:22,871 --> 01:06:25,420
an elusive Tj Dillashaw type guy.

2588
01:06:25,421 --> 01:06:26,320
He's an attacker.

2589
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:27,730
So how is he going to,

2590
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:28,061
you know,

2591
01:06:28,061 --> 01:06:29,310
what is he going to do with Linacre?

2592
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:30,430
Is he gonna chop the legs?

2593
01:06:30,431 --> 01:06:32,830
He's going to attack from
below like you did with Uriah?

2594
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:36,550
Like he fucked the rise leg up real
early in that fight to the port where it

2595
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:37,750
really limited your eyes.

2596
01:06:37,751 --> 01:06:38,584
Mobility.

2597
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:40,121
That's a,

2598
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:41,040
that's an interesting fight.

2599
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:41,950
I like that fight a lot.

2600
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:45,640
Carlos condit returns gets Magni Don Don,

2601
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:50,860
that's interesting to Carlos had
been out for quite a long time.

2602
01:06:50,861 --> 01:06:52,030
I want to say two years.

2603
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:52,840
Yeah.

2604
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:53,621
Click on his thing.

2605
01:06:53,621 --> 01:06:55,480
Let's find out when
was the last fight was,

2606
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:59,320
I want to say it was about two years ago,

2607
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:00,130
didn't he?

2608
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:03,970
He lost his Damien Maia and say that he
was talking about retirement or he was

2609
01:07:03,971 --> 01:07:04,600
retiring then?

2610
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:05,410
Yes.

2611
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:05,770
Yeah.

2612
01:07:05,770 --> 01:07:06,220
Okay.

2613
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:07,420
August,

2614
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:08,530
2016 so not quite that long ago.

2615
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:10,631
And then,

2616
01:07:10,631 --> 01:07:11,200
um,

2617
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,510
before that he lost the
Robbie Lawler fight,

2618
01:07:13,511 --> 01:07:17,590
which was a crazy five round war
and he lost a split decision.

2619
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:20,710
PTL Go and lost the tie Tyron.

2620
01:07:20,711 --> 01:07:21,281
So I mean,

2621
01:07:21,281 --> 01:07:21,930
those,

2622
01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:23,630
the victory over Tiago was phenomenal.

2623
01:07:23,631 --> 01:07:24,700
We caught him with that elbow.

2624
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:25,380
Yeah.

2625
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:25,690
Yeah.

2626
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:27,220
Murderer's row of his last opponents,

2627
01:07:27,221 --> 01:07:27,550
man.

2628
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:27,791
Yeah.

2629
01:07:27,791 --> 01:07:30,100
And they'll tie the Tyron
Woodley losses by injury.

2630
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:35,130
It says k Tko Tko but the reality is
tyrin hidden with a brutal leg kick and is

2631
01:07:35,481 --> 01:07:35,650
a,

2632
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:36,610
he's a knee blew out.

2633
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:37,790
Yeah.

2634
01:07:37,790 --> 01:07:38,623
What switches be.

2635
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:40,630
Apparently he had heard it before,

2636
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:44,800
but the power that Tyron Woodley has
in his fucking leg kicks like co Rice.

2637
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,980
Tyron Woodley had some choice
words about Colby Covington too.

2638
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:48,761
Yeah,

2639
01:07:48,761 --> 01:07:49,410
he was uh,

2640
01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:49,601
you know,

2641
01:07:49,601 --> 01:07:51,580
talking about Colby like campaigning,

2642
01:07:51,581 --> 01:07:54,250
hard to get the fight and talking
all kinds of crazy shit about him.

2643
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:56,230
But Tyron was saying like this,

2644
01:07:56,290 --> 01:07:56,860
first of all,

2645
01:07:56,860 --> 01:08:00,220
everything he's saying about our
training sessions is 100% bullshit.

2646
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:01,180
And he's like,

2647
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:02,710
when I get that dude in the octagon,

2648
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:04,360
if he ever does get that shot,

2649
01:08:04,361 --> 01:08:04,541
he goes,

2650
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:06,250
I am going to fuck him up.

2651
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:11,980
He was Colby Covington is never going
to fight again after he fazes me.

2652
01:08:11,981 --> 01:08:12,814
That's what he said.

2653
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:13,211
Yeah,

2654
01:08:13,211 --> 01:08:13,810
he was.

2655
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:16,220
We were talking before the weigh ins.

2656
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:21,250
We were standing around the octagon before
the Wayans past UFC in Detroit and he

2657
01:08:21,861 --> 01:08:22,580
was,

2658
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:23,730
he was like shaking his head.

2659
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:24,050
He's like,

2660
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:25,850
I am going to fuck that dude up.

2661
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:26,271
He's like,

2662
01:08:26,271 --> 01:08:27,140
he does not understand.

2663
01:08:27,141 --> 01:08:28,220
He's not on my level.

2664
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:29,690
He's talking to all kinds of shit.

2665
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:30,670
He's,

2666
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:31,280
you know,

2667
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:34,370
writing all these checks that there's
no way he's fucking talent can cache.

2668
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:35,391
And when I get them in there,

2669
01:08:35,391 --> 01:08:36,680
I'm going to smash him.

2670
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:37,380
And he goes,

2671
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:38,600
I'm going to take my time on him.

2672
01:08:38,601 --> 01:08:39,560
I'm gonna try to hurt him.

2673
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:39,921
He,

2674
01:08:39,921 --> 01:08:40,581
this is what he said to me.

2675
01:08:40,581 --> 01:08:41,041
This is crazy.

2676
01:08:41,041 --> 01:08:41,211
He goes,

2677
01:08:41,211 --> 01:08:45,260
I have never tried to hit anyone
with all my power in the octagon.

2678
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:46,161
And I'm like,

2679
01:08:46,161 --> 01:08:46,461
wait,

2680
01:08:46,461 --> 01:08:47,294
what?

2681
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:49,670
How is that possible?

2682
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,710
He sends people flying across the aisle,

2683
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:53,120
watch his fight with Jay Hiran.

2684
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:53,770
Oh yeah,

2685
01:08:53,770 --> 01:08:54,380
you can,

2686
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,910
you can hit somebody harder than that.

2687
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,073
Are you sure?

2688
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:57,980
Cause that's,

2689
01:08:57,980 --> 01:08:59,060
that doesn't seem normal.

2690
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:00,133
That doesn't seem right.

2691
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:01,180
Talking about his leg kicks.

2692
01:09:01,210 --> 01:09:02,060
I was just gonna ask you,

2693
01:09:02,061 --> 01:09:04,830
what'd you think of being
there for the gates?

2694
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:05,820
He Alvarez.

2695
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:07,161
That was great.

2696
01:09:07,161 --> 01:09:07,970
Gosh,

2697
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:08,803
it was amazing.

2698
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:10,880
There was two fights that night that made,

2699
01:09:10,881 --> 01:09:11,150
there was,

2700
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:12,110
there were humbling.

2701
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:13,130
Um,

2702
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:14,060
that was one of them.

2703
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:15,590
God fight was humbling,

2704
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:18,380
like the fucking guts and glory.

2705
01:09:18,590 --> 01:09:20,690
Watching those guys go at it.

2706
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:25,930
But Yancey Madeiros and cal by
Oliveira might've been even crazier.

2707
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:28,640
I think that was the
craziest fight of the night.

2708
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:31,460
And I believe that one
performance of the night,

2709
01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:32,840
thank the baby Jesus,

2710
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:33,981
because if it didn't,

2711
01:09:33,981 --> 01:09:37,670
there was some criminal shenanigans afoot.

2712
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:38,960
It was the craziest fight ever.

2713
01:09:38,961 --> 01:09:41,960
They one would get rocked and the other
would get rocked and you'd think the

2714
01:09:41,961 --> 01:09:42,501
fight was over.

2715
01:09:42,501 --> 01:09:43,460
And then the other one come back,

2716
01:09:43,461 --> 01:09:43,761
a rock,

2717
01:09:43,761 --> 01:09:44,570
the other one.

2718
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:46,430
And then finally Yancey
one and the third round.

2719
01:09:46,431 --> 01:09:46,611
I mean,

2720
01:09:46,611 --> 01:09:50,330
it was just a fucking k odic war.

2721
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:52,040
It was such a good fight.

2722
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:56,120
Just such a good fight to bonuses
to fight of the night awards.

2723
01:09:56,210 --> 01:09:57,043
That's nice.

2724
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:57,530
See,

2725
01:09:57,530 --> 01:09:59,300
that's what I love about the UFC when,

2726
01:09:59,301 --> 01:10:02,540
when people really perform and
lay it on the line like that,

2727
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:05,760
but did Allah did Haldo uh,

2728
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:06,800
although in Holloway,

2729
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:08,450
when any sort of a fight of the night,

2730
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:11,630
I know Francis didn't,

2731
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:12,380
but they said they're,

2732
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:12,591
yeah,

2733
01:10:12,591 --> 01:10:14,330
they're going to hook them
up with some sort of a bonus.

2734
01:10:14,331 --> 01:10:14,600
Yeah.

2735
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,490
How do you not give
that Guy Kao the night?

2736
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,353
What,

2737
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:18,380
what are we doing here?

2738
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:19,573
What is it?

2739
01:10:21,770 --> 01:10:23,190
What's that say?

2740
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:25,220
It just says that those two got fight at,

2741
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:26,480
doesn't say anything about anything else.

2742
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:26,871
Oh,

2743
01:10:26,871 --> 01:10:27,704
okay.

2744
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,090
Does it says that fight,

2745
01:10:29,091 --> 01:10:29,840
that fight of the night?

2746
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:29,971
No,

2747
01:10:29,971 --> 01:10:30,051
no,

2748
01:10:30,051 --> 01:10:30,290
no,

2749
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:31,123
no.

2750
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:33,770
Gay G and Cowboy Oliveira.

2751
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:35,660
Yancey Madeiros got fight of the night.

2752
01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:36,440
Well,

2753
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:39,350
Max Holloway's performance was
nothing short of masterful,

2754
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,710
nothing short of masterful
the way he handled the Aldo,

2755
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:43,530
the way he,

2756
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:43,830
he,

2757
01:10:43,830 --> 01:10:46,370
he yelled at me after the first round.

2758
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:47,560
He gets done with the f,

2759
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,560
the round that he runs.

2760
01:10:48,561 --> 01:10:49,460
He's going back to his end.

2761
01:10:49,461 --> 01:10:49,851
He looks at me,

2762
01:10:49,851 --> 01:10:50,150
goes,

2763
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:51,650
the man is tired.

2764
01:10:51,890 --> 01:10:53,330
The man is tired.

2765
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:55,160
He's a motherfucker,

2766
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:55,731
dude.

2767
01:10:55,731 --> 01:10:59,210
Max Holloway is a real fucking warrior.

2768
01:10:59,270 --> 01:11:00,650
I mean to the core.

2769
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:02,330
That guy relishes it.

2770
01:11:02,331 --> 01:11:03,164
He loves it.

2771
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:04,033
When he was like,

2772
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:05,690
like chicken neck in it all,

2773
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:06,770
he's got his hands down.

2774
01:11:06,771 --> 01:11:08,540
He's talking shit to
them and stocking them.

2775
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:11,720
You could see it in all of
those face like he was drowning.

2776
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:12,770
He would see the waves were,

2777
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:16,350
and he knew he wasn't going to be
able to dog paddle for too long.

2778
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:17,940
Like he's like Jesus Christ.

2779
01:11:17,941 --> 01:11:18,061
Like,

2780
01:11:18,061 --> 01:11:19,440
how am I going to keep up with this guy?

2781
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:21,450
And the thing about Max Holloway,

2782
01:11:21,451 --> 01:11:25,410
it's so interesting is
he's in a lot of ways,

2783
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:30,180
he has that sort of Nick Diaz approach
where he's not hitting you with all of

2784
01:11:30,181 --> 01:11:30,660
his mind.

2785
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:34,710
He's not throwing these haymakers unless
he's got you hurt until he's got you

2786
01:11:34,711 --> 01:11:35,010
hurt.

2787
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:35,910
Once he's got you hurt,

2788
01:11:35,911 --> 01:11:37,830
then he's just fucking
whip and bombs your way.

2789
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:39,090
But until then,

2790
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:43,290
he's just constantly on you
just constantly peppering
you caused on your kit,

2791
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:44,310
knee punch,

2792
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:45,001
move forward,

2793
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:45,660
move forward,

2794
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:48,060
and you're just dealing with
him and trying to breathe.

2795
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:49,200
You don't get any breath.

2796
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:51,480
And he just keeps that pressure on you.

2797
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,450
And he knew all those fading right now.

2798
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:55,470
And I'll tell you all to look
good in that first round.

2799
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:58,890
I thought he was going to start picking
it up like almost the old with the leg

2800
01:11:58,891 --> 01:12:01,050
kicks he should have,

2801
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:01,913
he should have gone,

2802
01:12:02,050 --> 01:12:05,550
his strategy should have been
almost entirely leg kick centered.

2803
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:05,970
Right.

2804
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:08,490
And he was trying to catch him and he
caught him with a couple of good punches.

2805
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,740
But all of his punches are sprints,

2806
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:11,161
right.

2807
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:12,990
And if he doesn't knock
you out with those sprints,

2808
01:12:12,991 --> 01:12:15,060
like he only has so many
of those in the gas tank,

2809
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:19,770
you're fighting the guy that can do it
for a marathon and he and he can and Max

2810
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:19,771
Holloway,

2811
01:12:19,771 --> 01:12:20,191
Ken,

2812
01:12:20,191 --> 01:12:25,191
he is so well conditioned and so aware
of visibility and not stretching himself.

2813
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:27,390
So when they got to the third,

2814
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:31,980
he started slugging it out with all
those at the very beginning of the third.

2815
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:32,221
He's like,

2816
01:12:32,221 --> 01:12:33,300
I know this guy's tired.

2817
01:12:33,301 --> 01:12:33,511
He goes,

2818
01:12:33,511 --> 01:12:34,800
I'm going to make them sprint with me.

2819
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:37,470
And you could see like as the,

2820
01:12:37,471 --> 01:12:40,620
the beginning of the
third round played out,

2821
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:42,480
all doe was swinging wild.

2822
01:12:42,481 --> 01:12:43,600
Adam and I was watching this,

2823
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:44,051
I was a,

2824
01:12:44,051 --> 01:12:46,920
I was going like this is not conservative.

2825
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,410
Like he's not conserving
his energy at all.

2826
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:54,390
What he's doing is trying to take Max
Holloway out with one shot and he's

2827
01:12:54,391 --> 01:12:56,640
blowing out his entire wad doing this.

2828
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:02,000
And then you saw Holloway just coming
out common on common on just bang,

2829
01:13:02,071 --> 01:13:02,341
Bang,

2830
01:13:02,341 --> 01:13:02,730
Bang,

2831
01:13:02,730 --> 01:13:03,031
pop,

2832
01:13:03,031 --> 01:13:03,301
pop,

2833
01:13:03,301 --> 01:13:03,541
pop,

2834
01:13:03,541 --> 01:13:03,811
pop,

2835
01:13:03,811 --> 01:13:06,900
pop and all of those trying to move
his head and he's using all his head

2836
01:13:06,901 --> 01:13:07,191
movement,

2837
01:13:07,191 --> 01:13:08,580
but he never gets a break.

2838
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:08,791
Yeah,

2839
01:13:08,791 --> 01:13:09,750
it's an incredible pace.

2840
01:13:09,751 --> 01:13:10,584
That Halloween,

2841
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:11,270
incredible.

2842
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:12,480
It doesn't give you any space.

2843
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:13,680
You don't get any rest.

2844
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:14,401
You don't get it.

2845
01:13:14,401 --> 01:13:14,640
He does.

2846
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,470
There's no lay in back with Holloway.

2847
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:18,120
Max Holloway's on you,

2848
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:18,720
on you,

2849
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:19,553
on you.

2850
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:22,470
I love what he said about
fighting Aldo in Rio too.

2851
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:23,041
He goes,

2852
01:13:23,041 --> 01:13:24,060
that's what kings do.

2853
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:25,141
He goes,

2854
01:13:25,141 --> 01:13:28,140
they go to the other person's
village and they'd take the crown.

2855
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:28,560
It's like,

2856
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:29,580
Ooh,

2857
01:13:30,270 --> 01:13:30,960
it's right.

2858
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:31,793
That's what they do.

2859
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:32,873
That's what he did.

2860
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:34,170
He's the baddest motherfucker.

2861
01:13:34,171 --> 01:13:35,760
I think he's the best one 45 forever.

2862
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:36,241
I mean,

2863
01:13:36,241 --> 01:13:38,100
he might not agree with it
yet because of the record,

2864
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:39,360
which I see.

2865
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:39,991
I see his point,

2866
01:13:39,991 --> 01:13:42,150
but the way he fights the,

2867
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:45,720
the octagon Iq that he shows his,

2868
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:50,780
his fight Iq is ability to find a weakness
and to see it as predatory behavior

2869
01:13:51,001 --> 01:13:51,960
inside the octagon.

2870
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:53,040
I think he's the best.

2871
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:53,881
I really do.

2872
01:13:53,881 --> 01:13:55,510
I just think I,

2873
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:00,520
it's so impressive to me that he's not
like Aldo in his prime was spectacular

2874
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:02,850
and amazingly impressive.

2875
01:14:02,851 --> 01:14:06,420
Like his flying knee first
round knock out of Cub Swanson,

2876
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:08,580
the knockout of Chad Mendez,

2877
01:14:08,581 --> 01:14:08,791
you know,

2878
01:14:08,791 --> 01:14:09,624
I mean he's,

2879
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:10,141
he's uh,

2880
01:14:10,141 --> 01:14:10,371
the,

2881
01:14:10,371 --> 01:14:11,460
the Uriah fight,

2882
01:14:11,461 --> 01:14:12,220
we brutalize

2883
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:13,053
your rise leg.

2884
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:13,571
I mean,

2885
01:14:13,571 --> 01:14:17,140
he's unquestionably one
of the greats of all time,

2886
01:14:17,141 --> 01:14:18,190
but in my opinion,

2887
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:19,600
skill wise,

2888
01:14:19,690 --> 01:14:21,460
Max Holloway has now surpassed him.

2889
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:22,510
I think he's the best.

2890
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:23,693
Yeah.

2891
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:26,440
What are your takes hoot or who do you
have for the ability for heavyweight

2892
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:27,310
tournament?

2893
01:14:27,310 --> 01:14:29,950
I'm fucking very curious about that.

2894
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:30,641
First of all,

2895
01:14:30,641 --> 01:14:33,910
I thought it was really interesting they
decided to go with Michio owned versus

2896
01:14:33,911 --> 01:14:34,700
Roy Nelson.

2897
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:35,533
Right.

2898
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:39,370
I thought that was interesting
because first of all,

2899
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,540
Mitch reone just knocked
out fade or right.

2900
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:44,440
Wouldn't you like want to see that again?

2901
01:14:44,650 --> 01:14:47,980
Like it doesn't fit his fate or want to
see that again cause Mitre Jones fight

2902
01:14:47,981 --> 01:14:48,814
and Frank Mir,

2903
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:52,660
I do not know what kind of
testing that Beltour is employing,

2904
01:14:52,661 --> 01:14:55,210
but I hope it's wild west style testing.

2905
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:56,890
I hope they pee in a cup.

2906
01:14:56,891 --> 01:14:58,840
Hold it up to the light and
if nothing swimming in it,

2907
01:14:58,841 --> 01:14:59,171
they go,

2908
01:14:59,171 --> 01:15:00,004
you're good.

2909
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:02,790
Let them roll.

2910
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:03,011
Yeah.

2911
01:15:03,011 --> 01:15:04,060
I'm kind of campaigning right now.

2912
01:15:04,061 --> 01:15:04,894
It'd be the alternate.

2913
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:05,830
So I would love,

2914
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:06,131
love,

2915
01:15:06,131 --> 01:15:07,180
love to be the alternate in return.

2916
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:10,180
What is your ranking in the
Bellator heavyweight division?

2917
01:15:10,181 --> 01:15:11,230
Right now they have one.

2918
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:13,210
I'm not sure that they
really have an official one,

2919
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:13,740
so,

2920
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:14,050
um,

2921
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:14,740
but I'm,

2922
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:15,100
you know,

2923
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:16,000
I think if,

2924
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:18,490
if I'm not in there for
this as the alternate,

2925
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:23,260
I think that I'll be one of the first
title defenses and I'll be hoping for,

2926
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:25,690
and I'll say active,

2927
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:26,350
I'm gonna fight,

2928
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:28,930
hopefully I'll pick it up to
two to three fights a year.

2929
01:15:29,690 --> 01:15:33,340
And King Mo is in the heavyweight
tournament with Ryan Bader.

2930
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:36,010
That's the light heavyweight
champion that's gonna happen in May.

2931
01:15:36,011 --> 01:15:39,310
It's chill versus rampage January.

2932
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:39,940
Uh,

2933
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:40,720
then it's the,

2934
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:43,780
the Roy Nelson and Matt
Mitrione and February.

2935
01:15:44,050 --> 01:15:46,510
And then they have the
fade or versus Frank Mir,

2936
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:47,200
um,

2937
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,430
in April.

2938
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:49,990
So they're going to
take a break and March,

2939
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:53,500
don't think I don't like about this is
it locks everybody up for a long ass

2940
01:15:53,501 --> 01:15:54,130
time.

2941
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:54,341
Like,

2942
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:59,290
I would like it if that was all on like
two shows or maybe even one crazy card,

2943
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:00,041
you know,

2944
01:16:00,041 --> 01:16:01,870
have all the fights on one car.

2945
01:16:01,871 --> 01:16:03,610
I think Mir has to wait until April.

2946
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:05,410
So it was that contract.

2947
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:08,500
I think it's the testing that
he had in the UFC and then,

2948
01:16:08,501 --> 01:16:09,100
uh,

2949
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:11,260
all the test and validate or don't do it.

2950
01:16:12,510 --> 01:16:16,030
And so I think he's suspended
until April and then it can fight.

2951
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:17,553
And so,

2952
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:18,190
but that,

2953
01:16:18,190 --> 01:16:18,851
that fight,

2954
01:16:18,851 --> 01:16:21,160
I think probably a lot
of fans 10 years ago,

2955
01:16:21,161 --> 01:16:21,371
but,

2956
01:16:21,371 --> 01:16:25,220
but now two are going to be really excited
to see Mir versus fate or you know,

2957
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:27,630
to kind of legendary champions.

2958
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:28,420
Um,

2959
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:29,200
and then,

2960
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:29,431
uh,

2961
01:16:29,431 --> 01:16:32,950
I don't know why the Bader one and
king mo ones all the way back in May,

2962
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:36,490
but I think most had some pretty
significant injuries that he's had to deal

2963
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:37,324
with.

2964
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:38,860
And Bader just fought recently,

2965
01:16:38,861 --> 01:16:40,270
so maybe he needed some time to,

2966
01:16:40,690 --> 01:16:41,230
um,

2967
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:41,650
but yeah,

2968
01:16:41,650 --> 01:16:44,470
maybe it's the injuries
with Mo and by man.

2969
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,071
I'm excited.

2970
01:16:45,071 --> 01:16:45,441
So I'm,

2971
01:16:45,441 --> 01:16:47,290
I'm just training and ready to jump in.

2972
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:48,333
I'm a,

2973
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:50,860
I'm actually getting to go
climb Mount Kilimanjaro.

2974
01:16:50,861 --> 01:16:51,730
Maybe I will actually,

2975
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:52,290
I'm,

2976
01:16:52,290 --> 01:16:56,950
I'm deciding on it this next week to see
if I can submit the alternate position

2977
01:16:56,951 --> 01:16:57,490
or not.

2978
01:16:57,490 --> 01:16:57,851
To me,

2979
01:16:57,851 --> 01:17:00,610
the big one is Rory Macdonald.

2980
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,570
Douglas Lema.

2981
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:02,861
That's the big one.

2982
01:17:02,861 --> 01:17:03,190
Yeah,

2983
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:04,120
that's the January.

2984
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:04,901
That's the big one.

2985
01:17:04,901 --> 01:17:05,530
That's going to be big.

2986
01:17:05,530 --> 01:17:06,400
That's the one where I'm like,

2987
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:07,263
okay.

2988
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:10,430
Cause I feel like when it comes
the welterweight division,

2989
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:16,330
Bella Tor has two guys
and Lima and in the sea,

2990
01:17:17,211 --> 01:17:18,020
the Lima thing,

2991
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:22,820
the only thing that stands out in the
Lima thing is Ben Aspirin was Ben her and

2992
01:17:22,821 --> 01:17:23,810
it was a long time ago,

2993
01:17:24,050 --> 01:17:24,883
no doubt about it.

2994
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:29,350
But Ben asked her and just had his way
with Lima and had his way with Korskoff

2995
01:17:29,490 --> 01:17:33,020
has his way with all these guys that to
me and Ben's coming on the podcast next

2996
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:33,021
month.

2997
01:17:33,021 --> 01:17:33,771
We got them scheduled.

2998
01:17:33,771 --> 01:17:34,340
Awesome.

2999
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:34,550
Uh,

3000
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:35,990
before or after,

3001
01:17:35,991 --> 01:17:36,830
I forget which one,

3002
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:37,311
the,

3003
01:17:37,311 --> 01:17:38,000
uh,

3004
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:38,900
event out here,

3005
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:40,670
the bell tour event.

3006
01:17:40,671 --> 01:17:42,950
But I feel like that is,

3007
01:17:43,370 --> 01:17:43,581
I mean,

3008
01:17:43,581 --> 01:17:44,510
now that he's retired,

3009
01:17:44,511 --> 01:17:48,530
that is my biggest regret
that he didn't get in MMA,

3010
01:17:48,531 --> 01:17:49,820
that he didn't get into the UFC.

3011
01:17:50,030 --> 01:17:50,900
My biggest regret.

3012
01:17:51,070 --> 01:17:51,950
I wish I could have worked that out.

3013
01:17:51,951 --> 01:17:52,551
Whatever it was.

3014
01:17:52,551 --> 01:17:53,384
Fuck.

3015
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:55,040
I wanted to see what would happen.

3016
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:57,530
You want to see what happens
with him and Tyron Woodley.

3017
01:17:57,530 --> 01:18:00,680
You want to see what happens with him
and worldclass wrestlers were also

3018
01:18:00,681 --> 01:18:01,461
knockout artists.

3019
01:18:01,461 --> 01:18:04,910
You want to see what happens with him
and the elite of the elite at one 70 in

3020
01:18:04,911 --> 01:18:06,650
the octagon and for whatever reason,

3021
01:18:06,651 --> 01:18:09,120
and I'm sure he'll tell us
and I'm sure he'll be very,

3022
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:10,220
very outspoken.

3023
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:11,180
Yeah.

3024
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:12,110
I wonder if it's the,

3025
01:18:12,111 --> 01:18:13,100
the whole style thing.

3026
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,800
I mean like the hardcore fans,

3027
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,430
the hardcore fans love it,

3028
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,620
but then it's almost like a,

3029
01:18:18,621 --> 01:18:19,460
I won't use his name,

3030
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:23,720
but I know a fighter that fought in
the upper weight classes in the UFC,

3031
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:24,260
you know,

3032
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:26,900
nine or 10 wins and only
two losses and gets cut.

3033
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:27,740
Um,

3034
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:28,940
and so it's almost like,

3035
01:18:28,941 --> 01:18:29,151
you know,

3036
01:18:29,151 --> 01:18:30,410
you got to be with that.

3037
01:18:30,850 --> 01:18:31,430
Um,

3038
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:32,263
Jared Rochelle.

3039
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:33,470
Oh yeah.

3040
01:18:33,530 --> 01:18:34,220
I mean,

3041
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:35,053
great guy,

3042
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:36,081
awesome training partner,

3043
01:18:36,081 --> 01:18:36,914
great fighter.

3044
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:38,540
But he had some fights.

3045
01:18:38,541 --> 01:18:39,374
Why did he get cut?

3046
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:41,100
That was after just a,

3047
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:45,110
he had an early loss in the UFC and
then he went on a tear and then he had

3048
01:18:45,111 --> 01:18:46,910
another loss and they cut them one loss.

3049
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:47,210
Yeah,

3050
01:18:47,210 --> 01:18:48,050
that seems crazy.

3051
01:18:48,051 --> 01:18:49,160
So I think he had like eight,

3052
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:49,461
eight,

3053
01:18:49,461 --> 01:18:51,800
nine or 10 wins and only two losses there.

3054
01:18:52,170 --> 01:18:52,791
And then,

3055
01:18:52,791 --> 01:18:54,740
so it was after one loss and he was gone.

3056
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,920
So I believe it was
because of the style style.

3057
01:18:58,040 --> 01:18:58,873
But he's Batman,

3058
01:18:58,890 --> 01:18:59,120
man.

3059
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,860
That styles legitimate though.

3060
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:05,570
The problem is you can't decide
that you need things to be exciting.

3061
01:19:05,810 --> 01:19:06,620
You need things.

3062
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:08,990
You're your sport is
things being effective.

3063
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:10,610
The whole idea is like,

3064
01:19:10,611 --> 01:19:11,444
here you go,

3065
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:16,510
you got a guy like Francis in Ghana who
can knock anybody's head into another

3066
01:19:16,881 --> 01:19:17,570
dimension.

3067
01:19:17,570 --> 01:19:18,050
Right?

3068
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:23,050
Well what happens if Francis in Gando
gets mothered by some Rulon Gardner type

3069
01:19:25,041 --> 01:19:25,460
character?

3070
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:25,970
Rochelle.

3071
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:26,450
Yeah.

3072
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:29,450
Some giant dude who grabs a hold to him,

3073
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:33,230
dragged him to the ground and
fucking hammer fists item for three,

3074
01:19:33,231 --> 01:19:34,010
five rounds.

3075
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:34,281
You know,

3076
01:19:34,281 --> 01:19:35,061
like you don't,

3077
01:19:35,061 --> 01:19:35,870
you want to see that?

3078
01:19:35,870 --> 01:19:36,703
I want it.

3079
01:19:36,950 --> 01:19:40,880
I want to know that
this kind of guy can be,

3080
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:42,440
can be immobilized,

3081
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:43,790
that he can be neutralized.

3082
01:19:43,791 --> 01:19:48,791
And we've seen Ben her and do that to
really like Korskoff and Lima to fucking

3083
01:19:49,491 --> 01:19:51,500
straight up assassins right.

3084
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:52,790
We've seen him do that.

3085
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:54,193
So um,

3086
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:58,100
I wanted to see him try to fight like
some of the elite of the elite because I

3087
01:19:58,101 --> 01:20:00,320
think that style is critical.

3088
01:20:00,590 --> 01:20:00,890
The,

3089
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:04,730
the wrestling style is the hardest style
to deal with if you can't compete with

3090
01:20:04,731 --> 01:20:05,540
the wrestler.

3091
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:06,590
That's why I've always had,

3092
01:20:06,591 --> 01:20:07,860
if you had like a pyramid

3093
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:10,650
of all the techniques in martial arts,

3094
01:20:10,651 --> 01:20:11,790
like what would be the most important?

3095
01:20:11,791 --> 01:20:15,810
I think wrestling because the ability to
dictate where the fight takes place and

3096
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:17,700
by wrestling I include takedown defense,

3097
01:20:17,701 --> 01:20:19,230
which is obviously a wrestling skill,

3098
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:20,730
but wrestling,

3099
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:23,850
the ability to dictate where the
fight takes place is fucking critical.

3100
01:20:23,851 --> 01:20:27,690
And if you could take the guy down that
the having the ability to take a guy

3101
01:20:27,691 --> 01:20:28,710
down his giant,

3102
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:30,210
you're on top of them,

3103
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:31,530
you're smothering him,

3104
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:32,790
he's got to carry your weight.

3105
01:20:32,791 --> 01:20:33,960
It's exhausting.

3106
01:20:34,010 --> 01:20:35,580
You're beating him up all he's down there.

3107
01:20:35,610 --> 01:20:36,061
It's just,

3108
01:20:36,061 --> 01:20:37,380
it's a giant factor,

3109
01:20:38,030 --> 01:20:38,251
you know,

3110
01:20:38,251 --> 01:20:38,660
all,

3111
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:41,070
obviously every fight
starts standing up and,

3112
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:44,490
but when a good striker is
finding a good wrestler,

3113
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:47,550
they're fucking always
worried to let anything go.

3114
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:49,500
As soon as they tee off on something,

3115
01:20:49,501 --> 01:20:51,660
Woo the doubles on them and
then they're on their ass.

3116
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:56,550
So I think that a guy who has been
proven to be one of the most difficult

3117
01:20:56,551 --> 01:20:57,570
wrestlers to deal with,

3118
01:20:57,571 --> 01:21:00,390
to not have him fight in
the octagon is a tragedy.

3119
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:03,150
It's fucking real bummer man.

3120
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:03,600
Yeah,

3121
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:04,433
it is.

3122
01:21:04,550 --> 01:21:08,400
And I wonder how many wrestlers out
there looking at in Ghana and going,

3123
01:21:08,401 --> 01:21:11,310
I wonder when it would happen
if you take that guy down.

3124
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:11,980
Yeah,

3125
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:12,361
I mean,

3126
01:21:12,361 --> 01:21:13,890
even me being in the same weight class,

3127
01:21:13,891 --> 01:21:14,540
I mean that's,

3128
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:15,180
that's my,

3129
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:16,160
my wife was asking me,

3130
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:17,190
who would you be?

3131
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:17,970
Um,

3132
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:19,650
more terrified to fight before the fight,

3133
01:21:19,730 --> 01:21:20,010
you know,

3134
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:20,843
with Alice,

3135
01:21:20,970 --> 01:21:21,511
how much should we reach?

3136
01:21:21,511 --> 01:21:22,140
62.

3137
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:24,660
We can get you down to
a five gets you going.

3138
01:21:24,661 --> 01:21:24,921
The key.

3139
01:21:24,921 --> 01:21:25,651
Oh yeah.

3140
01:21:25,651 --> 01:21:27,030
But when Overeem and him were,

3141
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:28,041
we're facing us,

3142
01:21:28,041 --> 01:21:28,321
she's like,

3143
01:21:28,321 --> 01:21:29,460
which one would you prefer to fight?

3144
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:29,881
And I was like,

3145
01:21:29,881 --> 01:21:30,660
I think Negan,

3146
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:32,560
I think Francis really well,

3147
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:34,390
this was before he pays and,

3148
01:21:34,710 --> 01:21:34,981
uh,

3149
01:21:34,981 --> 01:21:35,910
Allister into orbit.

3150
01:21:35,910 --> 01:21:36,121
But,

3151
01:21:36,121 --> 01:21:36,510
uh,

3152
01:21:36,510 --> 01:21:36,820
I,

3153
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:37,081
I,

3154
01:21:37,081 --> 01:21:39,420
because he'd take him down
to come down and then,

3155
01:21:39,421 --> 01:21:39,780
uh,

3156
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:40,680
and then it's your game.

3157
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:40,980
Uh,

3158
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:41,700
hopefully.

3159
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:44,880
And so parents is so
seasoned and everything else,

3160
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:45,660
uh,

3161
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:49,380
and he does have some takedown defense
and he does have some submissions.

3162
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:51,480
So I've just seen him
be more well rounded.

3163
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:52,261
And uh,

3164
01:21:52,261 --> 01:21:52,531
so,

3165
01:21:52,531 --> 01:21:53,430
but that was before,

3166
01:21:53,670 --> 01:21:55,530
right before obviously.

3167
01:21:56,090 --> 01:21:56,250
Yeah.

3168
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:57,690
I would've talked to you
before that and I said,

3169
01:21:57,691 --> 01:21:58,524
no,

3170
01:21:59,190 --> 01:21:59,700
no,

3171
01:21:59,700 --> 01:21:59,931
because,

3172
01:21:59,931 --> 01:22:00,180
um,

3173
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:03,330
my thought before the fight when I talked
to shop shop and I would talk on the

3174
01:22:03,331 --> 01:22:03,481
phone,

3175
01:22:03,481 --> 01:22:03,691
he said,

3176
01:22:03,691 --> 01:22:04,590
what do you think's going to happen?

3177
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:05,281
I think,

3178
01:22:05,281 --> 01:22:05,820
I think he's,

3179
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:07,770
I think Allister doesn't make
it out of the first round.

3180
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:10,770
I think we went over all the
Times Alistair's been stopped.

3181
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:12,390
That's a big factor.

3182
01:22:12,391 --> 01:22:13,224
It was a big factor.

3183
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:14,670
I said no more than 10 times.

3184
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:15,300
Yes.

3185
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:16,710
More than 10 times in MMA,

3186
01:22:16,711 --> 01:22:17,341
I think it was,

3187
01:22:17,341 --> 01:22:21,570
what was it like 12 times 13 times in
MMA and then three or four times in

3188
01:22:21,571 --> 01:22:22,560
kickboxing as well.

3189
01:22:22,690 --> 01:22:23,491
What's that analogy?

3190
01:22:23,491 --> 01:22:24,330
Is there any truth to it?

3191
01:22:24,331 --> 01:22:26,550
It's almost like a peanut
butter jar or something.

3192
01:22:26,551 --> 01:22:27,660
The first time you open it,

3193
01:22:27,661 --> 01:22:30,830
you got to get out a towel and put
over it and tried to really hard to,

3194
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:34,740
to open that lid and then after that it's
a little easier and then it's a little

3195
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:37,740
easier until eventually you do it
enough and you can just spin it off.

3196
01:22:37,741 --> 01:22:38,320
Just flick it,

3197
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,153
you know?

3198
01:22:39,390 --> 01:22:40,860
Well he's in the flick at stage,

3199
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:42,331
but it doesn't matter.

3200
01:22:42,331 --> 01:22:44,760
That punch would have knocked him
out when he was 20 Oh yeah though,

3201
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:45,653
talked to anyone else.

3202
01:22:46,330 --> 01:22:48,480
My hunch was in second tour,

3203
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:49,141
Roy Nelson,

3204
01:22:49,141 --> 01:22:51,720
either either of those guys
and the way he threw it,

3205
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:53,460
it was like a leg,

3206
01:22:53,730 --> 01:22:58,730
like from the thigh and then whipping
that arm with the whole body behind it.

3207
01:22:59,401 --> 01:23:01,140
Just full torque.

3208
01:23:01,470 --> 01:23:02,910
I mean it had everything.

3209
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:04,290
It had all the power.

3210
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,310
I was a little skeptical of the

3211
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:06,910
[inaudible].

3212
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:08,170
It was probably from listening to Brendon,

3213
01:23:08,171 --> 01:23:09,790
but talk about the punching power,

3214
01:23:09,850 --> 01:23:10,151
uh,

3215
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:10,540
you know,

3216
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:10,721
well,

3217
01:23:10,721 --> 01:23:12,970
who else has mark haunted it and has cro,

3218
01:23:12,971 --> 01:23:15,430
cop kicked it and everything else and
then all of a sudden once you see that

3219
01:23:15,431 --> 01:23:15,700
punch,

3220
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:15,890
like,

3221
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:16,460
uh,

3222
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:16,760
he's,

3223
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:17,060
he's,

3224
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:17,893
he sealed the deal.

3225
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:22,840
I'm sure she'll calm boy's hands and
it's like holding hands with a fucking

3226
01:23:22,841 --> 01:23:23,674
cinder block.

3227
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:24,513
Let's see that again.

3228
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:26,170
Boom.

3229
01:23:26,170 --> 01:23:30,880
See how he like comes up from the thigh
and the arm whips up look this way.

3230
01:23:32,710 --> 01:23:33,790
Oh my goodness.

3231
01:23:33,791 --> 01:23:36,250
And he's and his hand as he's punching,

3232
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:38,830
he's moving in position
to punch a second time.

3233
01:23:38,831 --> 01:23:41,610
Then he Hammerfest some noise out bone.

3234
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:43,540
Thank goodness he got in there.

3235
01:23:44,190 --> 01:23:44,951
He certainly,

3236
01:23:44,951 --> 01:23:47,020
I mean the referee got
in as quick as he could,

3237
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:50,830
but he certainly could have
not hit him while he was down.

3238
01:23:50,831 --> 01:23:51,700
He was out cold.

3239
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:53,230
We can say,

3240
01:23:53,230 --> 01:23:53,470
okay.

3241
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:55,090
Knocked out with a bunch of the elbows.

3242
01:23:55,091 --> 01:23:56,070
Then they're like seven,

3243
01:23:56,110 --> 01:23:58,840
eight extra elbows at the end
before the ref stepped in,

3244
01:23:58,900 --> 01:23:59,830
in this past weekend.

3245
01:23:59,831 --> 01:24:00,664
Yeah.

3246
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:05,450
Do you remember him talking to the
Gary Goodridge and weren't like elbows,

3247
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:06,280
but like it was like,

3248
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:06,640
ah,

3249
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:06,980
man.

3250
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,140
Probably just stop that early.

3251
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:09,003
Pull up the card.

3252
01:24:09,730 --> 01:24:10,563
Sorry.

3253
01:24:12,170 --> 01:24:13,370
Try to figure out who it was.

3254
01:24:17,910 --> 01:24:18,890
Paul felt Paul Felder.

3255
01:24:18,910 --> 01:24:19,390
Yes.

3256
01:24:19,390 --> 01:24:20,910
Felder beat the shit out of him.

3257
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:21,580
Yeah.

3258
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:22,140
Um,

3259
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:25,980
that was an interesting fight because
what played out is exactly what I thought.

3260
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:26,611
I was like,

3261
01:24:26,611 --> 01:24:29,610
all Vera is really dangerous
with his grappling.

3262
01:24:29,910 --> 01:24:31,200
His grappling is phenomenal.

3263
01:24:31,201 --> 01:24:32,070
He is submitted,

3264
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,380
I think he's tied with hoists.

3265
01:24:34,381 --> 01:24:36,960
Gracie for submitting
the most guys in the UFC,

3266
01:24:36,961 --> 01:24:40,550
which is how bad ass asses hoists
crazy all these years later as he has

3267
01:24:40,570 --> 01:24:41,730
throughout the record's awesome.

3268
01:24:42,090 --> 01:24:43,560
Pretty God damn significant.

3269
01:24:43,610 --> 01:24:44,160
Yeah.

3270
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:44,993
But um,

3271
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:49,770
he smashed him with that one shot and
then he had such great help with this man.

3272
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:49,981
Yeah.

3273
01:24:49,981 --> 01:24:50,814
He tapped.

3274
01:24:51,090 --> 01:24:51,690
That's right.

3275
01:24:51,690 --> 01:24:53,130
That's what happened to and saw the tap.

3276
01:24:53,190 --> 01:24:54,023
Yeah.

3277
01:24:55,540 --> 01:25:00,310
And Felder just smashed him a Felder's
in an enormous 55 Felder walks around

3278
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,440
somewhere in the 185 pound range.

3279
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:03,311
And then GI,

3280
01:25:03,311 --> 01:25:04,810
it's down to 55.

3281
01:25:04,811 --> 01:25:04,931
Yeah,

3282
01:25:04,931 --> 01:25:05,411
he tapped,

3283
01:25:05,411 --> 01:25:06,580
but the referee didn't see it.

3284
01:25:06,610 --> 01:25:08,170
Two three.

3285
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:08,801
And you know,

3286
01:25:08,801 --> 01:25:09,820
he can't let 'em up.

3287
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:10,510
Five.

3288
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:11,343
Oof.

3289
01:25:12,870 --> 01:25:13,700
Yikes.

3290
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:15,040
She tapped a little harder than that.

3291
01:25:15,130 --> 01:25:15,431
Yeah,

3292
01:25:15,431 --> 01:25:16,390
you got to let don't,

3293
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:18,190
I mean that's like a humble tap.

3294
01:25:18,191 --> 01:25:19,490
Like you got it.

3295
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,130
You got to tap like,

3296
01:25:21,131 --> 01:25:21,964
okay,

3297
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:22,870
we're done here.

3298
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:23,411
Yeah.

3299
01:25:23,411 --> 01:25:24,450
You can't tap blood.

3300
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:25,111
Didn't even realize it.

3301
01:25:25,111 --> 01:25:25,690
Tapped.

3302
01:25:25,690 --> 01:25:26,650
Can't be reluctant.

3303
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:28,300
Can't have a reluctant tap.

3304
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:29,593
It's got to be like,

3305
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:30,820
but guys don't want to tap,

3306
01:25:30,821 --> 01:25:31,150
you know,

3307
01:25:31,150 --> 01:25:32,200
calm kind of tapping.

3308
01:25:32,650 --> 01:25:33,190
You know,

3309
01:25:33,190 --> 01:25:36,610
you've seen fives words guys
said they tapped but they didn't.

3310
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:36,910
Yeah.

3311
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:37,510
Yolanda thing,

3312
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:38,890
she still says she didn't tap.

3313
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:39,310
Yeah,

3314
01:25:39,310 --> 01:25:40,420
but she definitely did.

3315
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:43,960
She probably doesn't realize should
tap cause she was in dreamland,

3316
01:25:44,050 --> 01:25:44,280
you know.

3317
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:46,660
I mean she got hit so hard drip drop.

3318
01:25:46,661 --> 01:25:49,540
But guys have tapped said they didn't tap.

3319
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:51,700
Remember Marilla Bustamante
and Matt Lindland.

3320
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:52,730
That's what was going to say.

3321
01:25:53,710 --> 01:25:54,970
They restarted the fight.

3322
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,550
Matt Lindland got caught in an arm bar,

3323
01:25:57,551 --> 01:26:01,660
clearly tapped and a big John McCarthy,

3324
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:02,590
um,

3325
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:05,690
separate was declaring
Bustamante the winner.

3326
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:07,250
Lindland said I didn't tap,

3327
01:26:07,251 --> 01:26:08,084
I was moving around,

3328
01:26:08,090 --> 01:26:08,601
was moving around.

3329
01:26:08,601 --> 01:26:09,434
He was in town.

3330
01:26:10,030 --> 01:26:10,760
Okay.

3331
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:11,570
Okay.

3332
01:26:11,570 --> 01:26:13,250
And then most to Monte you can tell.

3333
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:13,551
He's like,

3334
01:26:13,551 --> 01:26:15,440
what in the fuck are you serious?

3335
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:18,870
And then they make them go back at it
again and then he catches them in a

3336
01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:19,790
guillotine the next round.

3337
01:26:20,210 --> 01:26:20,391
Yeah.

3338
01:26:20,391 --> 01:26:20,930
I mean I,

3339
01:26:20,930 --> 01:26:25,160
I started in 2005 or six fighting and
I remember a lot of wrestlers talking

3340
01:26:25,161 --> 01:26:26,600
about wrestler Trex as if someone,

3341
01:26:26,601 --> 01:26:29,000
if you go for the double leg and
he started getting a take down,

3342
01:26:29,001 --> 01:26:29,480
you know,

3343
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:29,960
tap.

3344
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:30,411
Here it is.

3345
01:26:30,411 --> 01:26:31,244
Watch.

3346
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:33,480
That's,

3347
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,021
well,

3348
01:26:34,021 --> 01:26:34,740
I don't know.

3349
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:35,550
Hold on,

3350
01:26:35,550 --> 01:26:36,510
let me watch that again.

3351
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:38,160
Let me watch that again.

3352
01:26:39,970 --> 01:26:40,803
Play it right there.

3353
01:26:41,590 --> 01:26:42,010
Yeah,

3354
01:26:42,010 --> 01:26:42,341
that looks,

3355
01:26:42,341 --> 01:26:43,174
so he's tapping,

3356
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:45,630
but then he says there's not.

3357
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:46,493
Hmm.

3358
01:26:46,770 --> 01:26:48,150
It seems like you wanted a tap,

3359
01:26:48,810 --> 01:26:49,640
but he didn't.

3360
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:49,821
Hmm.

3361
01:26:49,821 --> 01:26:50,654
Let me see it again.

3362
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:52,800
I'm less convinced now.

3363
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:54,090
Watch this again.

3364
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:55,193
Here it is.

3365
01:26:56,130 --> 01:26:58,200
He's got the arm turns him over.

3366
01:26:59,650 --> 01:26:59,831
Yeah,

3367
01:26:59,831 --> 01:27:00,640
that's a tap.

3368
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:00,940
Yeah.

3369
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:01,810
That's fucking top.

3370
01:27:02,110 --> 01:27:02,680
Yeah.

3371
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:03,190
And then he said,

3372
01:27:03,190 --> 01:27:04,023
didn't,

3373
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:08,920
I know a lot of wrestlers were
talking about if you know,

3374
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:09,870
you get the guillotine,

3375
01:27:10,030 --> 01:27:12,620
try to see where the ref is and
then you can tap on the other side.

3376
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,690
You remember jail did that.

3377
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:14,590
Oh yeah,

3378
01:27:14,590 --> 01:27:17,170
it shell did that with
Polo field all in WEC.

3379
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:17,410
Yeah,

3380
01:27:17,410 --> 01:27:18,243
that's right.

3381
01:27:18,310 --> 01:27:23,310
And then they fought again the second
time guys Celio didn't make weight and now

3382
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:25,270
he catches him with the Guillotine.

3383
01:27:25,790 --> 01:27:27,160
And this is it right here.

3384
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:28,061
Old School.

3385
01:27:28,061 --> 01:27:28,541
Carlson.

3386
01:27:28,541 --> 01:27:29,890
Gracie style son.

3387
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:31,921
Yeah.

3388
01:27:31,921 --> 01:27:34,350
I mean most of Montana
was wizard back then.

3389
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:37,730
A lot of people forgot how good
he was at the top of his game.

3390
01:27:37,731 --> 01:27:39,420
And he was one of the fun.

3391
01:27:39,450 --> 01:27:40,740
That's a tab right there.

3392
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:42,840
And he was one of the fucking best.

3393
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:44,430
Such a good Jujitsu guy.

3394
01:27:44,431 --> 01:27:45,720
I'm really good boxing too.

3395
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:47,130
But uh,

3396
01:27:47,130 --> 01:27:49,400
Paul Fellow went crazy remembering it was,

3397
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:52,110
who was kind of like the
second time they fought,

3398
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:53,010
he missed weight.

3399
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:58,250
So Sunnen should rightly by
all accounts really be the,

3400
01:27:58,650 --> 01:28:01,980
he should have been the
e c 185 pound champion.

3401
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:03,240
But he never,

3402
01:28:03,630 --> 01:28:07,140
he never got that title because
Filo didn't make the weight.

3403
01:28:07,530 --> 01:28:12,090
And then they had some real weird
fight where like Filio was saying,

3404
01:28:12,091 --> 01:28:12,640
just do my,

3405
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:14,000
my friend come to the ground with me.

3406
01:28:14,010 --> 01:28:14,280
He's like,

3407
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:14,971
can't do that.

3408
01:28:14,971 --> 01:28:15,804
Sorry.

3409
01:28:16,490 --> 01:28:17,790
He's talking to him like,

3410
01:28:17,791 --> 01:28:18,330
you know,

3411
01:28:18,330 --> 01:28:19,040
you remember when,

3412
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:19,570
but he could,

3413
01:28:19,570 --> 01:28:22,730
Paul had to like a kind of
a little bit of a breakdown,

3414
01:28:22,740 --> 01:28:22,890
right?

3415
01:28:22,890 --> 01:28:23,150
Yeah.

3416
01:28:23,150 --> 01:28:27,030
Kind of Mike Tyson Tattoo on his
face and he was acting real weird.

3417
01:28:27,031 --> 01:28:27,864
Appeared.

3418
01:28:28,450 --> 01:28:29,283
Yeah.

3419
01:28:30,330 --> 01:28:32,730
He was a monster at one point in time.

3420
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:33,031
Yeah.

3421
01:28:33,031 --> 01:28:33,570
He was uh,

3422
01:28:33,570 --> 01:28:34,440
submitting everybody.

3423
01:28:34,441 --> 01:28:36,300
He was so good and he
submitted a bunch of people.

3424
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:38,580
At least one or two
people in pride I believe.

3425
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:39,750
Um,

3426
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:40,141
but yeah,

3427
01:28:40,141 --> 01:28:40,741
he was a,

3428
01:28:40,741 --> 01:28:41,610
another guy.

3429
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:42,740
He was a crossing Gracie guys.

3430
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:42,991
Well,

3431
01:28:42,991 --> 01:28:43,530
right.

3432
01:28:43,530 --> 01:28:44,020
I believe so,

3433
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:44,370
yeah.

3434
01:28:44,370 --> 01:28:47,940
World Class Jujitsu guy who's
just a little pit bull of a man.

3435
01:28:48,510 --> 01:28:48,960
Yeah.

3436
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:49,680
Yeah.

3437
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:51,150
Like the pre Paul Polaris.

3438
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:54,420
What do you think about what
word rise in is doing now?

3439
01:28:54,510 --> 01:28:55,000
You know,

3440
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,570
rising is trying to kind of
bring back the pride days.

3441
01:28:58,710 --> 01:28:59,640
I miss the pride days,

3442
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:01,500
so yeah.

3443
01:29:01,501 --> 01:29:01,861
A lot.

3444
01:29:01,861 --> 01:29:02,550
So

3445
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:03,383
I support it.

3446
01:29:03,970 --> 01:29:06,540
I hope they do it well and
doing a lot of freak shows too,

3447
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:11,160
like they had was in rise and Gabby
Garcia versus some made the old lady,

3448
01:29:11,670 --> 01:29:12,840
the grandma on a couple.

3449
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:13,330
Yeah.

3450
01:29:13,330 --> 01:29:13,960
There's one.

3451
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:15,300
She literally fought a grandma,

3452
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:17,820
not just joking around
like she was a grandmother.

3453
01:29:18,630 --> 01:29:19,680
Grandma with a bad knee.

3454
01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:20,603
Remember?

3455
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:21,923
See,

3456
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:25,260
like once it started it was
like they put her up to that.

3457
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:26,400
Why she didn't want to be on that.

3458
01:29:26,510 --> 01:29:26,890
Why?

3459
01:29:26,890 --> 01:29:28,000
Why would they put her up there?

3460
01:29:28,010 --> 01:29:28,950
I have no clue.

3461
01:29:28,980 --> 01:29:31,050
Maybe they can't find
anyone to fight Gabby.

3462
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:32,550
I'm sure they can't.

3463
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:33,390
Yeah.

3464
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:34,170
But uh,

3465
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:35,250
it's almost like a,

3466
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:37,530
I would rather not see
that fight happened though.

3467
01:29:38,220 --> 01:29:38,730
No,

3468
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:43,730
Gabby Garcia is probably
225 pounds and jacked.

3469
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:44,670
Yeah.

3470
01:29:44,670 --> 01:29:45,840
She would be in my training partner.

3471
01:29:45,890 --> 01:29:46,650
Yes.

3472
01:29:46,650 --> 01:29:47,251
Look legit.

3473
01:29:47,251 --> 01:29:48,084
Legitimately.

3474
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:48,901
I'm six three,

3475
01:29:48,901 --> 01:29:49,710
two 62.

3476
01:29:49,710 --> 01:29:50,620
She'd be my train partner.

3477
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:52,200
Crazy.

3478
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:52,890
She'd be,

3479
01:29:52,890 --> 01:29:53,850
I think she's taller than you.

3480
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:54,241
Oh,

3481
01:29:54,241 --> 01:29:55,020
she probably is.

3482
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:55,853
She's a gorilla.

3483
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:57,533
So big.

3484
01:29:57,630 --> 01:30:01,230
So finding a female competitor
to compete with her.

3485
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:02,550
Good luck.

3486
01:30:02,550 --> 01:30:03,180
Yeah.

3487
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:03,361
Well,

3488
01:30:03,361 --> 01:30:05,270
whenever they were always
talking about the rouse,

3489
01:30:05,290 --> 01:30:06,123
he could beat,

3490
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:07,073
um,

3491
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:09,450
guys in her division and
different stuff like that.

3492
01:30:09,451 --> 01:30:12,030
You would almost think that they have to
have no other options to where Gabby is

3493
01:30:12,031 --> 01:30:13,200
going to have to fight a guy someday.

3494
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:13,861
I know,

3495
01:30:13,861 --> 01:30:14,071
right.

3496
01:30:14,071 --> 01:30:15,900
Maybe like a one 85 or
something like that.

3497
01:30:16,030 --> 01:30:16,770
But,

3498
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:17,430
but yeah,

3499
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:18,420
like good size of her.

3500
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:19,853
Oh my goodness.

3501
01:30:20,070 --> 01:30:21,330
It's so insane.

3502
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:24,270
And this is her versus a
little girl and kickboxing.

3503
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:25,530
This is a kickboxing fight.

3504
01:30:25,590 --> 01:30:26,251
Oh my God.

3505
01:30:26,251 --> 01:30:26,610
She said,

3506
01:30:26,610 --> 01:30:29,070
oh what are those gloves?

3507
01:30:29,730 --> 01:30:31,920
Maybe a the smaller one.

3508
01:30:31,921 --> 01:30:34,980
Didn't want to fight her in MMA gloves
because they take too much of the beat

3509
01:30:35,610 --> 01:30:36,180
boxing gloves.

3510
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:36,560
Don't think.

3511
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:36,840
Yeah,

3512
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,910
I think this is a kickboxing fight.

3513
01:30:38,911 --> 01:30:41,220
I think that's why they stopped
the fight after that takedown.

3514
01:30:41,370 --> 01:30:42,060
Okay.

3515
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:42,300
Alright.

3516
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:43,770
Cause they got back up to their feet.

3517
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,540
It's like maybe it's
an MMA fighter though,

3518
01:30:45,541 --> 01:30:45,880
doing it.

3519
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:46,713
Ooh,

3520
01:30:47,130 --> 01:30:48,210
she's getting battered.

3521
01:30:48,770 --> 01:30:50,220
I'm just getting hit by tree trunks.

3522
01:30:51,290 --> 01:30:53,670
But it's so crazy when she fought grandma,

3523
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:54,533
that was a,

3524
01:30:55,010 --> 01:30:55,530
it was like,

3525
01:30:55,530 --> 01:30:57,240
I was sad for the woman that had to be,

3526
01:30:57,690 --> 01:30:58,523
had to go out there.

3527
01:30:58,820 --> 01:31:03,820
And this is in Brazil versus Megumi
Yabu she thought Japan brutal knockout.

3528
01:31:05,070 --> 01:31:06,270
Illegal soccer kick.

3529
01:31:06,271 --> 01:31:06,511
Okay.

3530
01:31:06,511 --> 01:31:07,261
I don't want to watch this.

3531
01:31:07,261 --> 01:31:07,850
Here it is.

3532
01:31:07,850 --> 01:31:09,120
Oh Jesus Christ.

3533
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:11,430
Illegal soccer's Keck.

3534
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:12,510
That's it.

3535
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:13,290
That's good night.

3536
01:31:13,290 --> 01:31:13,441
Yeah.

3537
01:31:13,441 --> 01:31:14,860
When you're a hundred
pounds bigger than someone.

3538
01:31:14,861 --> 01:31:17,100
And please don't soccer kick
them when they're down illegally.

3539
01:31:17,130 --> 01:31:19,320
That's just seems like logical.

3540
01:31:19,410 --> 01:31:20,760
Adding insult to injury.

3541
01:31:21,180 --> 01:31:24,160
So what else is coming up next
that you're excited about is um,

3542
01:31:24,570 --> 01:31:27,840
Paul Daley Fighting Semtex um,

3543
01:31:27,841 --> 01:31:28,980
I mean Semtex fighting,

3544
01:31:29,010 --> 01:31:29,690
um,

3545
01:31:29,690 --> 01:31:30,090
uh,

3546
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:32,010
Michael Denham page that they're,

3547
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:32,521
they want to,

3548
01:31:32,521 --> 01:31:33,930
I know that some Texas going after that,

3549
01:31:33,931 --> 01:31:34,651
going after that one,

3550
01:31:34,651 --> 01:31:35,041
after that,

3551
01:31:35,041 --> 01:31:37,440
but I don't think it's finalized
cause Michael Page into the fight.

3552
01:31:37,441 --> 01:31:38,370
Does he want to have that fight?

3553
01:31:38,550 --> 01:31:40,590
I think he's a little more
on the fence about it.

3554
01:31:41,490 --> 01:31:44,820
I think daily is like campaigning
for at least the last I heard.

3555
01:31:44,910 --> 01:31:46,800
I love shit talking with a British accent.

3556
01:31:46,830 --> 01:31:47,190
Yeah.

3557
01:31:47,190 --> 01:31:48,270
It's one of my favorite things.

3558
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:48,910
Yeah.

3559
01:31:48,910 --> 01:31:50,030
Anything with a British accent,

3560
01:31:50,070 --> 01:31:51,600
especially from daily,

3561
01:31:51,601 --> 01:31:51,871
you know,

3562
01:31:51,871 --> 01:31:53,190
like you look at him,

3563
01:31:53,191 --> 01:31:54,720
this muscular animal,

3564
01:31:54,810 --> 01:31:56,070
he's such a fucking psycho.

3565
01:31:57,180 --> 01:31:59,010
What a fucking lefthand that guy's,

3566
01:31:59,170 --> 01:31:59,710
Gosh,

3567
01:31:59,710 --> 01:32:00,190
when he stopped

3568
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:01,210
Lorens Lark and I was like,

3569
01:32:01,211 --> 01:32:02,290
Whoa,

3570
01:32:02,310 --> 01:32:02,700
that's,

3571
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:03,580
that's for real.

3572
01:32:03,670 --> 01:32:03,970
Yeah.

3573
01:32:03,970 --> 01:32:04,390
There'll be,

3574
01:32:04,390 --> 01:32:06,340
there'll be really exciting
to see if it happens.

3575
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:07,230
Yeah.

3576
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:09,250
Because even then on page
with that flying knee,

3577
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:10,310
oh,

3578
01:32:10,310 --> 01:32:11,160
with the Cyborg one,

3579
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:12,820
Jesus Christ.

3580
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:14,380
I've never seen anything
like that in my life.

3581
01:32:14,410 --> 01:32:14,710
Yeah.

3582
01:32:14,710 --> 01:32:15,880
I think it's the right fight to do.

3583
01:32:15,881 --> 01:32:17,080
So hopefully pages

3584
01:32:17,210 --> 01:32:18,110
and I don't think he's,

3585
01:32:18,230 --> 01:32:18,860
I don't know,

3586
01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:22,430
maybe it's other other details they
need to work out to make it happen.

3587
01:32:22,431 --> 01:32:23,000
But um,

3588
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,290
it seems like dailies the one
that's been campaigning for it.

3589
01:32:25,291 --> 01:32:25,530
Yeah.

3590
01:32:25,530 --> 01:32:25,800
Hmm.

3591
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:27,000
Like have an page hasn't yet.

3592
01:32:27,001 --> 01:32:27,320
So,

3593
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:27,570
yeah,

3594
01:32:27,570 --> 01:32:29,640
because after Roy McDonald beat daily,

3595
01:32:29,641 --> 01:32:30,001
daily,

3596
01:32:30,001 --> 01:32:32,430
it was immediately saying
he wanted to fight page.

3597
01:32:32,431 --> 01:32:32,720
Right.

3598
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:34,020
It wasn't like saying like,

3599
01:32:34,170 --> 01:32:36,810
I didn't really want or if
I Rory a fuck this fight.

3600
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:39,240
He's like immediately going after that.

3601
01:32:40,370 --> 01:32:41,550
He didn't want to rematch it.

3602
01:32:41,551 --> 01:32:42,384
Rory.

3603
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:46,410
He was just Michael van page and
him have some serious bad blood.

3604
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:47,513
Yeah.

3605
01:32:47,890 --> 01:32:48,723
Exciting.

3606
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:49,810
Really exciting.

3607
01:32:50,180 --> 01:32:50,760
I don't know.

3608
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:55,760
Here we go after boxing debut when
who's that's he had a boxing match.

3609
01:32:56,460 --> 01:32:57,390
Who's Paul daily.

3610
01:32:57,391 --> 01:32:57,930
That's funny.

3611
01:32:57,930 --> 01:32:59,250
Who the fuck is that guy?

3612
01:33:01,950 --> 01:33:03,510
Which is probably one of
the most brilliant lines.

3613
01:33:03,511 --> 01:33:03,691
No,

3614
01:33:03,691 --> 01:33:04,530
everyone else can copy.

3615
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:05,753
What's amazing,

3616
01:33:06,030 --> 01:33:06,863
the timing,

3617
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,100
the timing of that.

3618
01:33:08,101 --> 01:33:09,450
When Jeremy Stevens yelled that out,

3619
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:10,230
um,

3620
01:33:10,230 --> 01:33:10,440
yeah.

3621
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:11,430
Venom page looked amazing.

3622
01:33:11,431 --> 01:33:12,330
His boxing match.

3623
01:33:12,810 --> 01:33:15,510
It's like you're hearing all
this shit now about Connor Pob,

3624
01:33:15,780 --> 01:33:19,760
possibly fighting Paulie
Malignaggi and they patio,

3625
01:33:19,770 --> 01:33:20,170
right?

3626
01:33:20,170 --> 01:33:21,003
Huh?

3627
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:23,460
No boxing match in a cage.

3628
01:33:23,490 --> 01:33:23,941
That was the,

3629
01:33:23,941 --> 01:33:26,550
the latest like a boxing
match in the octagon.

3630
01:33:26,551 --> 01:33:27,330
Listen,

3631
01:33:27,330 --> 01:33:28,260
the Dobie a m,

3632
01:33:28,261 --> 01:33:28,650
m,

3633
01:33:28,650 --> 01:33:30,030
e WME crew.

3634
01:33:30,031 --> 01:33:31,440
The people who own the UFC,

3635
01:33:31,441 --> 01:33:36,000
now they're w w I think they're willing
to put on whatever fights going to bring

3636
01:33:36,001 --> 01:33:36,990
in the most shekels.

3637
01:33:37,190 --> 01:33:37,480
You know?

3638
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:38,550
That's what they got to do now.

3639
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:38,790
And,

3640
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:39,930
but now they got a star,

3641
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:42,720
I think in Ghana knew
one or two more fights.

3642
01:33:42,721 --> 01:33:44,910
You're going to be looking
at Mike Tyson days.

3643
01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:45,811
That's what I think.

3644
01:33:45,811 --> 01:33:47,280
I think in Ghana was going to be like,

3645
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:51,990
you're gonna Watch fights just to see
how long these motherfuckers can survive

3646
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:53,040
against that guy.

3647
01:33:53,130 --> 01:33:53,963
That's what I think.

3648
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:57,210
And I think that could be
their big breakout star Conner,

3649
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:59,760
who knows if he's ever
going to fight again.

3650
01:33:59,970 --> 01:34:00,241
I mean,

3651
01:34:00,241 --> 01:34:01,350
we really don't know.

3652
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:02,910
We haven't heard Conor saying,

3653
01:34:02,911 --> 01:34:03,151
you know,

3654
01:34:03,151 --> 01:34:04,440
this is my plan.

3655
01:34:04,590 --> 01:34:06,030
This is who I'm thinking about fighting.

3656
01:34:06,031 --> 01:34:06,864
This is what I want to fight.

3657
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:08,880
He's been talking shit to Max Holloway.

3658
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:11,190
He's been talking shit to Tony Ferguson,

3659
01:34:11,310 --> 01:34:13,410
but he's not sad like set it up.

3660
01:34:14,190 --> 01:34:17,910
So did you know what Francis was really
talking about whenever he was talking

3661
01:34:17,911 --> 01:34:19,110
about the slaves?

3662
01:34:19,130 --> 01:34:19,630
Yes.

3663
01:34:19,630 --> 01:34:20,440
Yes.

3664
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:21,240
That's so nuts.

3665
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:21,421
Yeah,

3666
01:34:21,421 --> 01:34:22,860
we played that on the podcast.

3667
01:34:22,861 --> 01:34:24,870
We showed a lot of that stuff
that's going on in Libya.

3668
01:34:24,871 --> 01:34:29,871
They had open slave auctions and people
filmed it and put it on youtube in 2017

3669
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:31,830
yeah,

3670
01:34:31,830 --> 01:34:33,870
I know multiple people from Uganda,

3671
01:34:33,871 --> 01:34:36,300
Rwanda and Congo that were um,

3672
01:34:37,410 --> 01:34:42,390
there were lured into some
of these countries like
there and they would go there

3673
01:34:42,391 --> 01:34:45,840
thinking that they were going to have
a job opportunity and that they'd be

3674
01:34:45,841 --> 01:34:47,670
working at this place or
that place or whatever.

3675
01:34:47,671 --> 01:34:51,750
And you start here and you work your way
up and automatically you're going to be

3676
01:34:51,751 --> 01:34:54,000
making more than you've
ever made in a year,

3677
01:34:54,090 --> 01:34:54,923
every week.

3678
01:34:55,010 --> 01:34:55,260
Um,

3679
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:59,090
and so they go there thinking that
they're going be able to have a new job,

3680
01:34:59,091 --> 01:35:00,980
send back a bunch of
money to their family,

3681
01:35:00,981 --> 01:35:02,060
then all sudden they get there.

3682
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:05,060
They take all their documents away
from them to where they can't travel.

3683
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:06,020
They can't escape.

3684
01:35:06,021 --> 01:35:06,501
If they do,

3685
01:35:06,501 --> 01:35:07,550
they don't speak the language.

3686
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:08,330
Um,

3687
01:35:08,330 --> 01:35:11,900
and then they throw him into someone's
house and they're literally their slave.

3688
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:12,680
Um,

3689
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:14,300
and they were lured there,

3690
01:35:14,330 --> 01:35:15,500
Nelson in your slave.

3691
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:16,733
Um,

3692
01:35:16,850 --> 01:35:17,271
keeping them,

3693
01:35:17,271 --> 01:35:19,160
therefore they will
keep them there forever.

3694
01:35:19,161 --> 01:35:22,220
But then some of these
families that were able to,

3695
01:35:22,370 --> 01:35:25,670
some of these people that are able
to make contact with their families,

3696
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,690
they have to fundraise and come up with
thousands and thousands of dollars.

3697
01:35:29,691 --> 01:35:34,250
I'm talking like an African family that
might make a dollar to a dollar 25 per

3698
01:35:34,251 --> 01:35:36,770
day is now having to come up with three,

3699
01:35:36,771 --> 01:35:37,050
four,

3700
01:35:37,050 --> 01:35:37,821
5,000,

3701
01:35:37,821 --> 01:35:40,400
$10,000 to try and grow.

3702
01:35:40,410 --> 01:35:42,440
I'm back to try to buy
them back out of it.

3703
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:43,303
So,

3704
01:35:43,870 --> 01:35:44,240
um,

3705
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:44,451
you know,

3706
01:35:44,451 --> 01:35:48,020
there's more slavery today than any
other time recorder industry in history.

3707
01:35:48,021 --> 01:35:48,291
Yeah.

3708
01:35:48,291 --> 01:35:50,870
So the lowest statistic is 27 million,

3709
01:35:50,871 --> 01:35:52,070
but I think it's over 30 million.

3710
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:53,930
Just stop and think about it.

3711
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:55,970
Most people in America,

3712
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:58,220
if you talk to him about
slavery and they're like,

3713
01:35:58,250 --> 01:35:58,730
oh yeah,

3714
01:35:58,730 --> 01:36:00,350
that ended in 1865.

3715
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:00,650
Nope.

3716
01:36:00,650 --> 01:36:01,010
Nope.

3717
01:36:01,010 --> 01:36:02,150
Not only did it not end,

3718
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:03,650
there's more today than ever,

3719
01:36:03,770 --> 01:36:05,480
but until we saw the Libya,

3720
01:36:05,930 --> 01:36:08,750
the youtube video where you see
the one guy saying he's a good,

3721
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:10,160
he can lift heavy things.

3722
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:11,090
He's a good digger.

3723
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:11,721
And you're like,

3724
01:36:11,721 --> 01:36:12,530
what?

3725
01:36:12,530 --> 01:36:14,990
And they were selling
them for like 400 bucks.

3726
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:16,220
600 bucks.

3727
01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:16,671
Yeah.

3728
01:36:16,671 --> 01:36:18,650
So the Loogootee pygmies actually,

3729
01:36:18,651 --> 01:36:20,690
so this is what the
documentary is really covering.

3730
01:36:20,691 --> 01:36:22,250
I cover a little bit of it in the book,

3731
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:24,410
but we've actually seen 1500 people.

3732
01:36:24,590 --> 01:36:26,540
And that's what at the
comedy store tonight,

3733
01:36:26,541 --> 01:36:30,020
we'll play the short trailer for it and
it's going to talk about the slavery

3734
01:36:30,021 --> 01:36:30,854
that's in there.

3735
01:36:30,870 --> 01:36:31,270
Uh,

3736
01:36:31,270 --> 01:36:32,820
there's 400 to 600,000.

3737
01:36:32,821 --> 01:36:36,740
My booty pygmies in the
Congo and basically all of
them are enslaved currently

3738
01:36:36,770 --> 01:36:37,603
right now.

3739
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:42,260
And so we've actually seen peaceful
negotiations of 1500 people transition out

3740
01:36:42,261 --> 01:36:44,570
of a life of slavery and
into a life of freedom.

3741
01:36:44,780 --> 01:36:46,610
And we're hoping that
we can replicate that.

3742
01:36:46,930 --> 01:36:51,080
And so how we're able to do it is
we're able to work with the local,

3743
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:53,150
state and national government,

3744
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:53,691
uh,

3745
01:36:53,691 --> 01:36:54,500
on documents.

3746
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:57,820
And then also we're able to buy back
the land from the slave masters.

3747
01:36:57,821 --> 01:37:02,600
So they benefit financially by having
maybe more money than they've ever made

3748
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:03,620
from their slaves.

3749
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:03,980
Um,

3750
01:37:03,980 --> 01:37:04,680
and then,

3751
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:05,513
uh,

3752
01:37:05,930 --> 01:37:07,310
we get water for both sides.

3753
01:37:07,311 --> 01:37:08,330
So the slave masters,

3754
01:37:08,331 --> 01:37:08,690
it's,

3755
01:37:08,690 --> 01:37:10,340
it's a different context for slavery.

3756
01:37:10,370 --> 01:37:12,650
There's a lot of places
like Libya or different,

3757
01:37:12,740 --> 01:37:13,100
um,

3758
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:15,890
countries that they're really rich
and they have a bunch of slaves.

3759
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:17,750
But in this context it's a,

3760
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:20,960
a family owns a family in most cases.

3761
01:37:20,961 --> 01:37:21,171
Some,

3762
01:37:21,171 --> 01:37:21,710
some of them,

3763
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:22,543
many families.

3764
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:23,001
Uh,

3765
01:37:23,001 --> 01:37:26,750
but there I've attended the
funerals of the slave masters kids.

3766
01:37:27,110 --> 01:37:27,440
Um,

3767
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:30,710
the slave master or the slave masters
kids are dying of dirty water because they

3768
01:37:30,711 --> 01:37:31,880
have zero access to it.

3769
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:33,890
And so whenever you can bring in,

3770
01:37:34,250 --> 01:37:36,800
because they're making a dollar
a dollar 25 a day on the film,

3771
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:38,750
there's going to be a beautiful
part on the documentary.

3772
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:41,510
I don't want to ruin that part
or so many of the thunder,

3773
01:37:41,511 --> 01:37:41,841
but it's,

3774
01:37:41,841 --> 01:37:42,350
um,

3775
01:37:42,350 --> 01:37:42,770
man,

3776
01:37:42,770 --> 01:37:47,150
there was a slave master crying on camera
with us crying because of how much of

3777
01:37:47,151 --> 01:37:48,530
a benefit it's been.

3778
01:37:48,531 --> 01:37:52,730
The piece that's come from not having
the slaves that he inherited from his

3779
01:37:52,731 --> 01:37:55,160
father who inherited them
from his grandfather,

3780
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:55,680
uh,

3781
01:37:55,680 --> 01:38:00,680
because it became a burden where
they're making a dollar dollar 25 a day,

3782
01:38:00,810 --> 01:38:02,100
they're spinning on average,

3783
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:02,963
the average,

3784
01:38:03,030 --> 01:38:03,360
uh,

3785
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:04,200
person and congressmen,

3786
01:38:04,201 --> 01:38:09,060
$185 a year on treatment
against waterborne disease.

3787
01:38:09,210 --> 01:38:10,200
So on medicine,

3788
01:38:10,201 --> 01:38:10,561
all stuff,

3789
01:38:10,561 --> 01:38:13,650
they're spending half of their
salary on waterborne disease.

3790
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:15,270
They're losing their kids because of it.

3791
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:19,080
And now there's making a dollar dollar
25 a day trying to take care of their own

3792
01:38:19,081 --> 01:38:19,800
family.

3793
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,650
How are they supposed to take
care of their slave family?

3794
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:24,600
And so they can give them just the scraps.

3795
01:38:24,810 --> 01:38:26,490
And so whenever we get
to come in there and say,

3796
01:38:26,491 --> 01:38:26,850
hey,

3797
01:38:26,850 --> 01:38:29,550
this land is rightfully
the [inaudible] pygmies,

3798
01:38:29,551 --> 01:38:31,240
they're the first citizens of,

3799
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:32,280
of Congo.

3800
01:38:32,410 --> 01:38:33,510
They're the first people here.

3801
01:38:33,511 --> 01:38:35,130
They're the native Congolese.

3802
01:38:35,330 --> 01:38:35,610
Um,

3803
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:36,151
they don't,

3804
01:38:36,151 --> 01:38:37,500
you think they deserve some land?

3805
01:38:37,501 --> 01:38:40,260
And so we kind of cast division
work together with them.

3806
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:44,700
It's all inclusive to where they get to
share their concerns and questions and

3807
01:38:44,970 --> 01:38:48,030
they get to be part of that
and say we want this here.

3808
01:38:48,330 --> 01:38:50,580
And so then all of a
sudden once that happens,

3809
01:38:50,581 --> 01:38:51,780
we do the land purchases,

3810
01:38:52,170 --> 01:38:53,220
it's all legal.

3811
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:53,851
And then,

3812
01:38:53,851 --> 01:38:54,630
um,

3813
01:38:54,630 --> 01:38:58,770
and then we bring in water for both
sides to where they both have clean water

3814
01:38:58,771 --> 01:39:00,960
access to that which changes everything.

3815
01:39:00,990 --> 01:39:05,990
Whenever the slave master's wife is on
average going 3.75 miles to go collect

3816
01:39:06,001 --> 01:39:06,540
water,

3817
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:07,920
she can't do other things.

3818
01:39:07,940 --> 01:39:09,070
You imagine that you're,

3819
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:11,710
you own slaves and you have to
walk three miles to get water.

3820
01:39:11,710 --> 01:39:12,980
We get water and,

3821
01:39:13,050 --> 01:39:13,371
or,

3822
01:39:13,371 --> 01:39:14,940
or you're a slave master.

3823
01:39:14,941 --> 01:39:17,550
And if you are fortunate enough that you,

3824
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:20,010
your wife doesn't have to
go collect water all day,

3825
01:39:20,310 --> 01:39:25,020
one of your kids can't go to school
because they have to go collect water all

3826
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:25,590
day.

3827
01:39:25,590 --> 01:39:29,200
And so in when those
Jerry cans or full 44 or,

3828
01:39:29,220 --> 01:39:30,053
sorry,

3829
01:39:30,150 --> 01:39:31,020
20 liters,

3830
01:39:31,170 --> 01:39:33,240
20 liters is 44 pounds when full.

3831
01:39:33,690 --> 01:39:35,040
And a lot of times you do it with too,

3832
01:39:35,070 --> 01:39:36,180
because if you're going to,

3833
01:39:36,210 --> 01:39:37,770
if you're not going to
carry it on your head,

3834
01:39:37,970 --> 01:39:39,630
and if you're going to
make the most of your time,

3835
01:39:39,631 --> 01:39:41,370
that 3.75 mile walk,

3836
01:39:41,730 --> 01:39:45,630
you're going to go at two Jerry cans on
that walk and then it will balance you

3837
01:39:45,631 --> 01:39:45,960
out,

3838
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:46,880
almost like kettlebells.

3839
01:39:46,940 --> 01:39:47,340
Um,

3840
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:50,370
and so you get to 44 pounds,

3841
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:51,570
almost kettlebells,

3842
01:39:51,570 --> 01:39:53,590
but Jerry cans of water that's moving,

3843
01:39:53,591 --> 01:39:54,570
that's so hard to carry.

3844
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:56,670
And he'd walk that back a hundred pounds,

3845
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:57,770
88 pounds.

3846
01:39:57,770 --> 01:39:58,250
Yeah,

3847
01:39:58,250 --> 01:39:58,710
yeah.

3848
01:39:58,710 --> 01:39:59,543
88 pounds.

3849
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:03,070
And so to be able to
alleviate some of them are,

3850
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:04,230
are girls that are,

3851
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:04,770
you know,

3852
01:40:04,770 --> 01:40:05,820
teenagers and stuff.

3853
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:06,660
Um,

3854
01:40:06,660 --> 01:40:10,350
and trying to get an American
teenager to carry 88 pounds.

3855
01:40:10,860 --> 01:40:11,540
I mean,

3856
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:12,373
I,

3857
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:13,170
I,

3858
01:40:13,170 --> 01:40:13,470
it hurts,

3859
01:40:13,470 --> 01:40:14,600
it hurts me going on.

3860
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:15,211
Like literally,

3861
01:40:15,211 --> 01:40:15,830
I go on those.

3862
01:40:15,830 --> 01:40:19,320
All our team normally does the waterwalk
and every new village that we go to.

3863
01:40:19,321 --> 01:40:20,880
So probably 70 water walks.

3864
01:40:20,881 --> 01:40:21,310
No,

3865
01:40:21,310 --> 01:40:23,010
and there might be one
or two that we didn't do.

3866
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:24,000
Um,

3867
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,750
but the first 13 we did
when I was there and a man,

3868
01:40:27,780 --> 01:40:29,400
it's too to understand,

3869
01:40:29,401 --> 01:40:33,450
to put yourself literally in their shoes
and go on that long walk and to have

3870
01:40:33,451 --> 01:40:37,740
the sore neck from carrying it on your
head or to have just your shoulders dying

3871
01:40:37,980 --> 01:40:39,840
because you're walking
back with 88 pounds.

3872
01:40:40,050 --> 01:40:40,770
You're not doing,

3873
01:40:40,770 --> 01:40:41,011
I mean,

3874
01:40:41,011 --> 01:40:43,170
think about whenever we're
doing those kettlebell walks,

3875
01:40:43,490 --> 01:40:43,771
I mean,

3876
01:40:43,771 --> 01:40:45,210
how many feet are we going by?

3877
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:49,110
Go miles that way on one of
those outdoors men's vests.

3878
01:40:49,170 --> 01:40:50,620
You know what those things are outdoors.

3879
01:40:50,660 --> 01:40:55,660
His pack it as a weight plate in back
of one of those posts for weight plates.

3880
01:40:56,330 --> 01:40:58,240
I slide on a 45 pound plate and I,

3881
01:40:58,241 --> 01:40:59,380
the hike the mountains with it,

3882
01:40:59,710 --> 01:41:01,120
just 45 pounds.

3883
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:02,921
I weighed 200 pounds.

3884
01:41:02,921 --> 01:41:03,161
Why?

3885
01:41:03,161 --> 01:41:04,540
Why would 45 pounds be a lot?

3886
01:41:04,570 --> 01:41:05,980
It's a fucking lot,

3887
01:41:05,981 --> 01:41:06,700
man.

3888
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:07,510
It's a lot.

3889
01:41:07,510 --> 01:41:11,530
So to think that these women are
carrying double that and they're walking

3890
01:41:11,531 --> 01:41:12,364
through the jungle.

3891
01:41:12,490 --> 01:41:12,790
Yeah,

3892
01:41:12,790 --> 01:41:13,530
it's fun man.

3893
01:41:13,530 --> 01:41:13,720
And,

3894
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:13,980
and,

3895
01:41:13,980 --> 01:41:14,120
uh,

3896
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:14,660
the,

3897
01:41:14,660 --> 01:41:14,890
uh,

3898
01:41:14,890 --> 01:41:16,000
it's not funny,

3899
01:41:16,001 --> 01:41:16,720
but I mean,

3900
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:17,100
uh,

3901
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:17,340
they,

3902
01:41:17,340 --> 01:41:19,210
they cracked up because
they're so used to,

3903
01:41:19,211 --> 01:41:19,510
uh,

3904
01:41:19,510 --> 01:41:20,410
to carrying this walk.

3905
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:21,840
But I'm going down this,

3906
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:24,970
this steep hill and it's on a little
foot trail and it's muddy because it had

3907
01:41:24,971 --> 01:41:25,804
been raining.

3908
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:26,733
Um,

3909
01:41:26,860 --> 01:41:28,700
and so I'm having this thing on my head.

3910
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:28,791
Oh,

3911
01:41:28,791 --> 01:41:30,400
I fall on my back in the water,

3912
01:41:30,401 --> 01:41:33,700
just soaks me because all the
water that we went and collected,

3913
01:41:33,890 --> 01:41:34,520
um,

3914
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:34,710
no,

3915
01:41:34,710 --> 01:41:35,543
I mean half of it,

3916
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:36,130
uh,

3917
01:41:36,130 --> 01:41:37,480
ended up on me and on the ground.

3918
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:38,950
Did you go back and get more water?

3919
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:39,933
No.

3920
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:40,690
Wow.

3921
01:41:40,690 --> 01:41:40,930
No,

3922
01:41:40,930 --> 01:41:41,471
cause we were,

3923
01:41:41,471 --> 01:41:44,530
we were currently trying to drill the
new well and we were getting pretty close

3924
01:41:44,531 --> 01:41:45,340
to it.

3925
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:45,760
Um,

3926
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:46,181
and so,

3927
01:41:46,181 --> 01:41:48,340
but just slipped and fallen
while you're doing it,

3928
01:41:48,341 --> 01:41:49,151
losing your balance.

3929
01:41:49,151 --> 01:41:52,060
I sprained my knee one time on
one of the water walks because a,

3930
01:41:52,061 --> 01:41:53,050
you're carrying all this weight,

3931
01:41:53,051 --> 01:41:55,390
you step in a hole and then all of
a sudden you sprained your ankle,

3932
01:41:55,391 --> 01:41:56,820
sprain your knee,

3933
01:41:56,830 --> 01:41:57,730
different stuff like that.

3934
01:41:57,820 --> 01:41:57,941
Well,

3935
01:41:57,941 --> 01:41:58,241
listen,

3936
01:41:58,241 --> 01:41:58,990
Justin Wren,

3937
01:41:58,990 --> 01:42:00,340
you were doing the Lord's work.

3938
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:01,510
You're doing amazing stuff,

3939
01:42:01,511 --> 01:42:01,871
man.

3940
01:42:01,871 --> 01:42:05,050
And I'm so happy that we can help and
I'm happy that we can help tonight.

3941
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:06,820
If you were thinking
about coming to the show,

3942
01:42:06,970 --> 01:42:09,160
you're shit out of luck sold out.

3943
01:42:09,190 --> 01:42:11,170
It was sold out a long fucking time ago.

3944
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:11,541
So,

3945
01:42:11,541 --> 01:42:11,770
uh,

3946
01:42:11,770 --> 01:42:12,940
tonight will be,

3947
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:14,050
uh,

3948
01:42:14,050 --> 01:42:15,280
Tom Segura,

3949
01:42:15,281 --> 01:42:16,510
Tony Hinchcliffe,

3950
01:42:16,511 --> 01:42:17,860
