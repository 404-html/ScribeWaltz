1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,170
The joe rogan experience are you?

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:03,061
Here's what you have to do.

3
00:00:03,061 --> 00:00:04,110
This is my new theory.

4
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,130
Identify the vampire in your life.

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,470
Find The van Pyre.

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,120
Identify the parasite.

7
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,490
Doesn't have to be that
you have parasites in life.

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,970
It is possible that you could have gotten
lucky and there's no parasites and you

9
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:18,720
get off groovy.

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:18,961
Sure.

11
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:19,141
No,

12
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:20,670
I'm not saying everyone's got one,

13
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,200
but if you got one,

14
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,580
if you're walking around with
those fucking vampire blues,

15
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,480
you've got the fucking heavy heart and
you and you can't feel happy and you feel

16
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:31,310
bad,

17
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:36,310
there may be an action that you need
to take that you're afraid to take.

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,290
That's the vampire and you've
got to fucking not even a person.

19
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,251
Oh No.

20
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:42,900
I mean it's a situation,

21
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:43,763
a,

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,080
yeah,

23
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,390
it's a vampire in your life.

24
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,750
Find a life sucking situation
that you're afraid to kill.

25
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,650
And the reason I say vampires because
vampire is only go or they're invited.

26
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,960
And generally the
situation that you're in,

27
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,370
you invited it in,

28
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,600
you invited this thing into your life
and now it's sucking your life energy and

29
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:02,880
your blood and your happiness away.

30
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,100
Don't.

31
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:04,830
It's in.

32
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,410
A lot of times you'll try to believe,

33
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:10,050
you'll try to convince yourself
that this thing is not a vampire,

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,071
but in your heart,

35
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:11,904
you know,

36
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,430
you're a servant to a
fucking blood sucker.

37
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,420
Urn felt this thing is like
sucking your life as it's away.

38
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,850
Sometimes it's doing it with a trade.

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,950
Quite often there'll be a bad trade.

40
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:23,731
You'll be,

41
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:24,001
you know,

42
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,620
whatever the situation
you're in and you'll,

43
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:25,871
you'll,

44
00:01:25,871 --> 00:01:26,210
you'll,

45
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,140
you'll feel like you're in this situation.

46
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:28,621
You know,

47
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:29,161
it's worth it.

48
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:29,851
It's kind of bad,

49
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:30,684
but it's totally worth it.

50
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,730
This happens with jobs quite often,

51
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:33,031
you know,

52
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:33,361
or you're like,

53
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:33,571
well,

54
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:33,931
you know,

55
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:35,490
but it's good enough.

56
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,450
That's the vampires.

57
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,490
You got to take a fucking stake
and drive it into its art too.

58
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:42,360
How do you kill a vampire?

59
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:43,080
Two ways.

60
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,100
Direct Action.

61
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,710
You don't kill a vampire by
like making up with a vampire.

62
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:49,950
You don't kill a vampire by like
having a sit down talk with a vampire.

63
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,240
You're not going to be able to like,

64
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,080
uh,

65
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,730
you know,

66
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,160
uh,

67
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,320
make friends with the vampire.

68
00:01:54,321 --> 00:01:55,500
There's two ways to kill a vampire.

69
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:56,130
One,

70
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:56,730
you fucking,

71
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,320
you know,

72
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,820
uh,

73
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,560
uh,

74
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,430
put a stake in its heart.

75
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:01,470
The other one is light sunlight,

76
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,483
truth,

77
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,280
light that it's the greatest
metaphor of all time.

78
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,390
You shine the light of
truth onto the situation,

79
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,290
fearlessly analyze it and
then you'll destroy it.

80
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:13,621
You know,

81
00:02:13,621 --> 00:02:16,140
because if you really allow
yourself a few can act.

82
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,680
You got to add the real problem with
people is not recognizing the enemy.

83
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,940
It's acting on that enemy.

84
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,050
That's the real problem.

85
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,180
That enemy being,

86
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:24,511
you know,

87
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:24,931
personal,

88
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:25,950
your personal demons,

89
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:26,100
your,

90
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,600
your personal jihad.

91
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,220
That's a personal issue.

92
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,270
You got to fight the beast and it's,

93
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,790
and you know what I mean?

94
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,200
It's like everybody's beast is different.

95
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:35,820
Chapter two of the Bhagavad Gita.

96
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,401
Arjun,

97
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:40,230
as dejection arginine has
drawn between these two forces.

98
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,460
He does not want to fight.

99
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,460
He drops his bow and God says to him,

100
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,680
you've got rise to the fight.

101
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,400
Fight.

102
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,270
You're a warrior.

103
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:49,680
This is what you're here for.

104
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,693
Fight,

105
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,280
fight.

106
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,710
It's better.

107
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,010
It's better to die.

108
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,170
It's better to die in a righteous battle.

109
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:58,020
Then goes skulking off into the
fucking woods and be a beggar.

110
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,130
It's better to fucking do what you do on,

111
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:00,791
you're a warrior.

112
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,020
You got to fucking do it,

113
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:02,560
man.

114
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,520
It fucking sucks.

115
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,080
When when you're drunk and you want to
throw up and you try to not make yourself

116
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:08,914
throw up,

117
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,060
just throw up.

118
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,410
You'll feel better.

119
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,610
You'll feel better in the end.

120
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:13,361
When you're puking,

121
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:15,340
it's going to suck because you're
helpless and you can't breathe.

122
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,241
Go through it,

123
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:16,750
man.

124
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,090
Fucking jab a fucking knife into the foot.

125
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:20,200
Not Literally of course,

126
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,040
but yeah,

127
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,800
you got to act and you've got to make
the big fucking decisions sometimes.

128
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:24,634
And it's scary.

129
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,050
If it wasn't scary,

130
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:27,100
it wouldn't be worth anything.

131
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:27,671
Yeah.

132
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:30,490
For some people it's almost like
they don't know how to start.

133
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,150
They know that there's action that
they need to take in their life,

134
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:36,160
but they're paralyzed
trying to think about it,

135
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,180
trying to figure out how to start,

136
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,450
and they can never gather
up the courage to get away.

137
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,970
It's like what saw a lot of people
stay in abusive relationships.

138
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,301
They don't,

139
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:44,380
they don't have the courage to lead.

140
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,271
Exactly.

141
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:47,670
Cause it's scary and it in
it and it seems like it,

142
00:03:47,671 --> 00:03:48,031
you know,

143
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:51,540
there's so many things that people
will like w ideas people will create,

144
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,160
they'll keep you trapped and whatever.

145
00:03:53,161 --> 00:03:53,550
Prison,

146
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:53,910
urine,

147
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,950
it's very similar to um,

148
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,031
and not,

149
00:03:57,031 --> 00:03:57,300
I mean,

150
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,690
what you're talking about in the
UFC with these fucking fighters,

151
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,440
this is a visual representation of
what anyone can do in their life,

152
00:04:04,441 --> 00:04:05,310
but you're not getting,

153
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:08,530
maybe not all of us are going to get
obviously be worldclass fighters.

154
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:12,030
He in a ring in front of the entire
planet and fucking knock someone out.

155
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,200
But you have in your life right now,

156
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:17,370
if you haven't already done this,

157
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:17,700
there's,

158
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,290
you have the chance to be heroic.

159
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:24,120
You have the ability right
now to make a heroic act.

160
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,140
They could kill you.

161
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,340
That's the thing,

162
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,061
these actions,

163
00:04:27,061 --> 00:04:29,430
it's not always guaranteed that
because you do the right thing,

164
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,500
you're going to end up in a great place.

165
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,970
You might end up fucked.

166
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:33,870
You might end up,

167
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,980
you might end up temporarily in a
homeless or you might end up temporarily

168
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,030
jobless.

169
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,080
If there wasn't risk associated with it,

170
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,720
you would've already done it.

171
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,793
That's the point,

172
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,221
you know,

173
00:04:44,221 --> 00:04:45,570
if there wasn't a risk associated with,

174
00:04:45,571 --> 00:04:46,740
it wouldn't be worth anything.

175
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,491
You know,

176
00:04:47,491 --> 00:04:48,330
if Mount Fucking,

177
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:49,290
uh,

178
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:49,621
you know,

179
00:04:49,621 --> 00:04:51,090
if the Himalayas where,

180
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:52,403
you know,

181
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,990
a little green grass
covered hill in a park,

182
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,640
nobody takes pictures of them at the top.

183
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:58,940
Putting a flag into what it is,

184
00:04:58,941 --> 00:05:00,990
a danger makes it heroic,

185
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:01,621
you know?

186
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:03,570
So sometimes you just have to fucking,

187
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,800
I sound like Tony Robbins.

188
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:05,820
Take the leap,

189
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,620
kill the vampire in your life.

190
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,670
Kill the vampire in your
life is a brilliant speech,

191
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:10,504
dude.

192
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,223
Okay

193
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,273
son.

194
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,680
Oh Shit.

195
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,513
Itunes

196
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,070
according to server,

197
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,150
the fuck Outta here.

198
00:05:42,151 --> 00:05:42,720
Server.
